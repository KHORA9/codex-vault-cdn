Plato, Goethe, Shakespeare and Napoleon\r\nassigned to certain dreams prophetic value.  Joseph saw\r\neleven stars of the Zodiac bow to himself, the twelfth star.\r\nThe famine of Egypt was revealed by a vision of fat and lean cattle.\r\nThe parents of Christ were warned of the cruel edict of Herod,\r\nand fled with the Divine Child into Egypt.\r\n\r\nPilate's wife, through the influence of a dream, advised her husband\r\nto have nothing to do with the conviction of Christ.  But the gross\r\nmaterialism of the day laughed at dreams, as it echoed the voice and\r\nverdict of the multitude, ``Crucify the Spirit, but let the flesh live.''\r\nBarabbas, the robber, was set at liberty.\r\n\r\nThe ultimatum of all human decrees and wisdom is to gratify\r\nthe passions of the flesh at the expense of the spirit.\r\nThe prophets and those who have stood nearest the fountain\r\nof universal knowledge used dreams with more frequency than\r\nany other mode of divination.\r\n\r\nProfane, as well as sacred, history is threaded with incidents\r\nof dream prophecy.  Ancient history relates that Gennadius\r\nwas convinced of the immortality of his soul by conversing\r\nwith an apparition in his dream.\r\n\r\nThrough the dream of Cecilia Metella, the wife of a Consul, the Roman Senate\r\nwas induced to order the temple of Juno Sospita rebuilt.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Marcian dreamed he saw the bow of the Hunnish conqueror\r\nbreak on the same night that Attila died.\r\n\r\nPlutarch relates how Augustus, while ill, through the dream\r\nof a friend, was persuaded to leave his tent, which a few hours\r\nafter was captured by the enemy, and the bed whereon he had lain\r\nwas pierced with the enemies' swords.\r\n\r\nIf Julius Caesar had been less incredulous about dreams he would\r\nhave listened to the warning which Calpurnia, his wife,\r\nreceived in a dream.\r\n\r\nCroesus saw his son killed in a dream.\r\n\r\nPetrarch saw his beloved Laura, in a dream, on the day she died,\r\nafter which he wrote his beautiful poem, ``The Triumph of Death.''\r\n\r\nCicero relates the story of two traveling Arcadians who went to\r\ndifferent lodgings--one to an inn, and the other to a private house.\r\nDuring the night the latter dreamed that his friend was begging for help.\r\nThe dreamer awoke; but, thinking the matter unworthy of notice, went to\r\nsleep again.  The second time he dreamed his friend appeared, saying it would\r\nbe too late, for he had already been murdered and his body hid in a cart,\r\nunder manure.  The cart was afterward sought for and the body found.\r\nCicero also wrote, ``If the gods love men they will certainly disclose\r\ntheir purposes to them in sleep.''\r\n\r\nChrysippus wrote a volume on dreams as divine portent.\r\nHe refers to the skilled interpretations of dreams as a true divination;\r\nbut adds that, like all other arts in which men have to proceed\r\non conjecture and on artificial rules, it is not infallible.\r\n\r\nPlato concurred in the general idea prevailing in his day,\r\nthat there were divine manifestations to the soul in sleep.\r\nCondorcet thought and wrote with greater fluency in his dreams\r\nthan in waking life.\r\n\r\nTartini, a distinguished violinist, composed his ``Devil's Sonata''\r\nunder the inspiration of a dream.  Coleridge, through dream influence,\r\ncomposed his ``Kubla Khan.''\r\n\r\nThe writers of Greek and Latin classics relate many instances\r\nof dream experiences.  Homer accorded to some dreams divine origin.\r\nDuring the third and fourth centuries, the supernatural origin\r\nof dreams was so generally accepted that the fathers, relying upon\r\nthe classics and the Bible as authority, made this belief a doctrine\r\nof the Christian Church.\r\n\r\nSynesius placed dreaming above all methods of divining the future;\r\nhe thought it the surest, and open to the poor and rich alike.\r\n\r\nAristotle wrote:  ``There is a divination concerning some things\r\nin dreams not incredible.''  Camille Flammarion, in his great book\r\non ``Premonitory Dreams and Divination of the Future,'' says:\r\n``I do not hesitate to affirm at the outset that occurrence of dreams\r\nforetelling future events with accuracy must be accepted as certain.''\r\n\r\nJoan of Arc predicted her death.\r\n\r\nCazotte, the French philosopher and transcendentalist, warned Condorcet\r\nagainst the manner of his death.\r\n\r\nPeople dream now, the same as they did in medieval and ancient times.\r\n\r\nThe following excerpt from ``The Unknown,''[1] a recent book\r\nby Flammarion, the French astronomer, supplemented with a few\r\nof my own thoughts and collections, will answer the purposes\r\nintended for this book.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] ``From `The Unknown.'  Published by Harper & Brothers Copyright,\r\n1900, by Camille Flammarion.''\r\n\r\n\r\n``We may see without eyes and hear without ears, not by unnatural excitement\r\nof our sense of vision or of hearing, for these accounts prove the contrary,\r\nbut by some interior sense, psychic and mental.\r\n\r\n``The soul, by its interior vision, may see not only what is\r\npassing at a great distance, but it may also know in advance\r\nwhat is to happen in the future.  The future exists potentially,\r\ndetermined by causes which bring to pass successive events.\r\n\r\n``POSITIVE OBSERVATION PROVES THE EXISTENCE OF A PSYCHIC WORLD,\r\nas real as the world known to our physical senses.\r\n\r\n``And now, because the soul acts at a distance by some power that belongs\r\nto it, are we authorized to conclude that it exists as something real,\r\nand that it is not the result of functions of the brain?\r\n\r\n``Does light really exist?\r\n\r\n``Does heat exist?\r\n\r\n``Does sound exist?\r\n\r\n``No.\r\n\r\n``They are only manifestations produced by movement.\r\n\r\n``What we call light is a sensation produced upon our optic nerve\r\nby the vibrations of ether, comprising between 400 and 756 trillions\r\nper second, undulations that are themselves very obscure.\r\n\r\n``What we call heat is a sensation produced by vibrations between 350\r\nand and{sic} 600 trillions.\r\n\r\n``The sun lights up space, as much at midnight as at midday.\r\nIts temperature is nearly 270 degrees below zero.\r\n\r\n``What we call sound is a sensation produced upon our auditory nerve\r\nby silent vibrations of the air, themselves comprising between 32,000\r\nand 36,000 a second.\r\n\r\n . . . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n``Very many scientific terms represent only results, not causes.\r\n``The soul may be in the same case.\r\n\r\n``The observations given in this work, the sensations, the impressions,\r\nthe visions, things heard, etc., may indicate physical effects produced\r\nwithout the brain.\r\n\r\n``Yes, no doubt, but it does not seem so.\r\n\r\n``Let us examine one instance.\r\n\r\n``Turn back to page 156.@@@\r\n\r\n``A young woman, adored by her husband, dies at Moscow.  Her father-in-law,\r\nat Pulkowo, near St. Petersburg, saw her that same hour by his side.\r\nShe walked with him along the street; then she disappeared.\r\nSurprised, startled, and terrified, he telegraphed to his son,\r\nand learned both the sickness and the death of his daughter-in-law.\r\n\r\n``We are absolutely obliged to admit that SOMETHING emanated\r\nfrom the dying woman and touched her father-in-law. This\r\n_thing unknown_ may have been an ethereal movement,\r\nas in the case of light, and may have been only an effect,\r\na product, a result; but this effect must have had a cause,\r\nand this cause evidently proceeded from the woman who was dying.\r\nCan the constitution of the brain explain this projection?\r\nI do not think that any anatomist or physiologist will give\r\nthis question an affirmative answer.  One feels that there is\r\na force unknown, proceeding, not from our physical organization,\r\nbut from that in us which can think.\r\n\r\n``Take another example (see page 57).@@@\r\n\r\n``A lady in her own house hears a voice singing.\r\nIt is the voice of a friend now in a convent, and she faints,\r\nbecause she is sure it is the voice of the dead.\r\nAt the same moment that friend does really die, twenty miles\r\naway from her.\r\n\r\n``Does not this give us the impression that one soul holds\r\ncommunication with another?\r\n\r\n``Here is another example (page 163):@@@\r\n\r\n``The wife of a captain who has gone out to the Indian mutiny sees one night\r\nher husband standing before her with his hands pressed to his breast,\r\nand a look of suffering on his face.  The agitation that she feels convinces\r\nher that he is either killed or badly wounded.  It was November 14th.\r\nThe War Office subsequently publishes his death as having taken place\r\non November 15th.  She endeavors to have the true date ascertained.\r\nThe War Office was wrong.  He died on the 14th.\r\n\r\n``A child six years old stops in the middle of his play and\r\ncries out, frightened:  ``Mamma, I have seen Mamma.''  At that\r\nmoment his mother was dying far away from him (page 124).@@@\r\n\r\n``A young girl at a ball stops short in the middle of a dance and cries,\r\nbursting into tears.  `My father is dead; I have just seen him.'\r\nAt that moment her father died.  She did not even know he was ill.\r\n\r\n``All these things present themselves to us as indicating\r\nnot physiological operations of one brain acting on another,\r\nbut psychic actions of spirit upon spirit.  We feel that they\r\nindicate to us some power unknown.\r\n\r\n``No doubt it is difficult to apportion what belongs to the spirit,\r\nthe soul, and what belongs to the brain.  We can only let ourselves\r\nbe guided in our judgment and our appreciations by the same\r\nfeeling that is created in us by the discussion of phenomena.\r\nThis is how all science has been started.  Well, and does not every\r\none feel that we have here to do with manifestations from beings\r\ncapable of thought, and not with material physiological facts only?\r\n\r\n``This impression is superabundantly confirmed by investigation concerning\r\nthe unknown faculties of the soul, when active in dreams and somnambulism.\r\n\r\n``A brother learns the death of his young sister by a terrible nightmare.\r\n\r\n``A young girl sees beforehand, in a dream, the man whom she will marry.\r\n\r\n``A mother sees her child lying in a road, covered with blood.\r\n\r\n``A lady goes, in a dream, to visit her husband on a distant steamer,\r\nand her husband really receives this visit, which is seen by a third person.\r\n\r\n``A magnetized lady sees and describes the interior of the body\r\nof her dying mother; what she said is confirmed by the autopsy.\r\n\r\n``A gentleman sees, in a dream, a lady whom he knows arriving at night\r\nin a railroad station, her journey having been undertaken suddenly.\r\n\r\n``A magistrate sees three years in advance the commission of a crime,\r\ndown to its smallest details.\r\n\r\n``Several persons report that they have seen towns and landscapes\r\nbefore they ever visited them, and have seen themselves in situations\r\nin which they found themselves long after.\r\n\r\n``A mother hears her daughter announce her intended marriage six months\r\nbefore it has been thought of.\r\n\r\n``Frequent cases of death are foretold with precision.\r\n\r\n``A theft is seen by a somnambulist, and the execution of\r\nthe criminal is foretold.\r\n\r\n``A young girl sees her fiance', or an intimate friend dying\r\n(these are frequent cases), etc.\r\n\r\n``All these show unknown faculties in the soul.  Such at least\r\nis my own impression.  It seems to me that we cannot reasonably\r\nattribute the prevision of the future and mental sight to a nervous\r\naction of the brain.\r\n\r\n``I think we must either deny these facts or admit that they must\r\nhave had an intellectual and spiritual cause of the psychic order,\r\nand I recommend sceptics who do not desire to be convinced, to deny\r\nthem outright; to treat them as illusions and cases of a fortuitous\r\ncoincidence of circumstances.  They will find this easier.\r\nUncompromising deniers of facts, rebels against evidence,\r\nmay be all the more positive, and may declare that the writers\r\nof these extraordinary narratives are persons fond of a joke,\r\nwho have written them to hoax me, and that there have been persons\r\nin all ages who have done the same thing to mystify thinkers\r\nwho have taken up such questions.\r\n\r\n``These phenomena prove, I think, that the soul exists,\r\nand that it is endowed with faculties at present unknown.\r\nThat is the logical way of commencing our study, which in the end\r\nmay lead us to the problem of the after-life and immortality.\r\nA thought can be transmitted to the mind of another.\r\nThere are mental transmissions, communications of thoughts,\r\nand psychic currents between human souls.  Space appears\r\nto be no obstacle in these cases, and time sometimes seems\r\nto be annihilated.''\r\n\r\nA few years ago a person whom I will designate as ``A'' related a dream\r\nto me as follows:  ``I take no interest in pugilism or pugilists,\r\nbut I saw, in a dream, every detail of the Corbett and Fitzsimmons mill,\r\nfour days before it took place out West.  Two nights before the fight I\r\nhad a second dream in which a favorite horse was running, but suddenly,\r\njust before the judge's stand was passed, a hitherto unobserved little black\r\nhorse ran ahead and the crowd shouted in my ears, `Fitzsimmons wins!' ''\r\n\r\n``B'' relates the following as a dream:  ``I saw the American soldiers,\r\nin clay-colored uniform, bearing the flag of victory two weeks\r\nbefore the Spanish-American war was declared, and of course before\r\nany living being could have known the uniform to be adopted.\r\nLater I saw, several days before the actual occurrence happened,\r\nthe destruction of Cervera's fleet by the American navy.''\r\nSigned ``B.''\r\n\r\n``Just after the South African hostilities began, I saw in a dream\r\na fierce struggle between the British and Boers, in which the former\r\nsuffered severe losses.  A few nights after I had a second dream\r\nin which I saw the contending forces in a long-drawn contest,\r\nvery disastrous to both, and in which neither could claim a victory.\r\nThey seemed to be fighting to a frazzle.''  Signed ``C.''\r\n\r\n``D'' related to me at the time of the occurrence of the dream the following:\r\n``It had been suggested to me that the two cereals, corn and wheat, were too\r\nfar apart, and that I ought to buy corn.  At noon I lay down on a lounge\r\nto await luncheon; I had barely closed my eyes before a voice whispered:\r\n`Don't buy, but sell that corn.'  `What do you mean?'  I asked.\r\n`Sell at the present price, and buy at 23 7/8.' '' The foregoing dream was\r\nrelated to me by a practical, successful business man who never speculates.\r\nI watched the corn market and know it took the turns indicated in the dream.\r\n\r\nIn this dream we find the dreamer conversing with some strange\r\nintelligence possessed of knowledge unknown to objective reason.\r\nIt could not, therefore, have been the waking thoughts\r\nof the dreamer, for he possessed no such information.\r\nWas the message superinduced through the energies and\r\nactivities of the waking mind on the subjective mind?\r\nThis could not have been, because he had no such thoughts;\r\nbesides, the intelligence given was free from the errors\r\nof the calculating and anxious waking mind.\r\n\r\nWe must therefore look to other sources for an explanation.  Was it\r\nthe higher self that manifested to Abraham in the dim ages of the world?\r\nWas it the Divine Voice that gave solace to Krishna in his abstraction?\r\nWas it the unerring light that preceded Gautama into the strange solitudes\r\nof Asia?  Was it the small voice that Elijah heard in the desert\r\nof Shurr?  Was it the Comforter of Jesus in the wilderness and the garden\r\nof distress?  Or, was it Paul's indwelling spirit of this earthly tabernacle?\r\nOne thing we may truthfully affirm--that it did not proceed from the rational,\r\nobjective mind of the rank materialist, who would close all doors to that\r\ninner life and consciousness where all true religion finds its birthmark,\r\nits hope, its promises and its faith; which, rightly understood,\r\nwill leave to the horrors of the Roman crucifixion the twin thieves,\r\nsuperstition and scepticism, while the angel of ``Goodwill'' will go\r\nfree to solace the world with the fruit and fragrance of enduring power\r\nand promise{.} The steel chains that fasten these hydra-headed crocodiles\r\nof sensuous poison around love and destiny can only be severed by the diamond\r\nof wisdom and knowledge.\r\n\r\nA citizen worthy of confidence relates the following dream:\r\n``In December, 1878, I saw in a dream my brother-in-law, Henry Yarnell,\r\nsuffering from a bloody knife wound; after this I awoke, but soon\r\nfell asleep again.  The second time I dreamed of a similar scene,\r\nexcept that the wound was the result of a shotgun.  After this I\r\ndid not go to sleep again.  I was much troubled about my dream,\r\nand soon started in the direction of my brother-in-law's house.\r\nI had not gone far, when I met an acquaintance who promptly informed\r\nme that my brother-in-law had been shot.''  Signed ``E.''\r\n\r\nA well-known resident of Chattanooga, Tenn., formerly of New York City,\r\nwill vouch for the accuracy of the following incident in his life:\r\n\r\n``On February 19, 1878, I was boarding with a family on Christopher street,\r\nNew York, while my wife and baby were visiting my parents in the country,\r\na short distance from the city.  Our baby was taken sick.\r\nThe malady developed into brain fever, followed by water on the brain,\r\ncausing the little one's death.\r\n\r\n``At our boarding-place there was at the time a quartette of us\r\ngrass widowers, as we called ourselves, and in order to pass away\r\nthe time pleasantly we had organized a `grass widowers' euchre club.'\r\nWe used to meet almost every evening after dinner in the dining-room,\r\nand play until about eleven o'clock, when we would retire.\r\nOn the above date I dreamed that after playing our usual evening\r\ngames we took our departure for our rooms, and on the way up\r\nthe second flight of stairs I heard a slight movement behind me;\r\non looking around I found I was being followed by a tall figure\r\nrobed in a long, loose white gown, which came down to the floor.\r\nThe figure seemed to be that of a man--I would say, about seven\r\nfeet tall--who followed me up the second flight and along\r\nthe hallway, entering my room.  After coming in the door he made\r\na circle of the room and seemed to be looking for something,\r\nand when he approached the door to make his exit he stopped still,\r\nand with a gesture of his hand remarked, `I have taken all you have.'\r\nOn the following morning, about 9:30 o'clock, I received a telegram\r\nfrom my wife announcing the death of our only baby.''  Signed ``F.''\r\n\r\nA well-known citizen of Chattanooga, Tenn., relates and vouches\r\nfor the truth of the following occurrence:\r\n\r\n``Several years ago, when a boy, I had a schoolmate and friend, Willie T.,\r\nbetween whom and myself there sprung up a mutual feeling of high regard.\r\nWe were chums in the sense that we were almost constantly together, both at\r\nschool and at home, and among the partnerships we formed was one of having\r\namateur shadowgraph and panoramic shows in the basement of Willie's home.\r\nThis much to show the mental and social relationship that existed between us.\r\nSome time during this association (I cannot recall the exact night now)\r\nI had a strange dream, in which my chum appeared to me with outstretched hand,\r\nasking me to shake, saying, `I shall not see you any more.'  With that,\r\nthe dream lapsed and was over.  I thought nothing of the occurrence, and had\r\nalmost forgotten it, when one day, about a week later, during which time I had\r\nnot had a glimpse of my chum, while he was out hunting with another friend,\r\nW. McC., in following him over a rail fence, the latter's gun was accidentally\r\ndischarged in Willie's face and neck, resulting in instant death.\r\nWith this shocking news the memory of the dream I had had came back to me\r\nvividly and puzzled me very greatly, and indeed has puzzled me to this day.''\r\nSigned ``G.''\r\n\r\nThe recipients of the above dreams are living to-day and their names\r\nand address may be obtained, none of them are credulous fanatics\r\nor predisposed to a belief in psychic or spirit phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe above dreams, except two, cannot be explained by telepathy,\r\nbecause the mental picture cast on the dream mind had not in either\r\ninstance taken place in waking life.  This would account for\r\nthe dream perception of ``D,'' which did not, in all probability,\r\ntake place until after the murder had been committed.\r\n\r\nThe vision of ``F'' might be disposed of in the same way.\r\nIn this instance ``F'' saw the white-robed specter open the door,\r\nwalk around the room and finally, taking his position as if\r\nto depart, say:  ``I have taken all you have.''  No doubt this\r\nvision took place at the exact moment of the child's death.\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of similar experiences occurring daily in the lives\r\nof honest, healthy and sane human beings, that rival the psychic\r\nmanifestations of Indian Yogism or Hebrew records.\r\n\r\nStill men go on doubting this true and loving subjective intelligence\r\nthat is constantly wooing for entrance into the soul and is ever\r\nvigilant in warning the material life of approaching evils.\r\nThey prefer the Witch of Endor, and the Black Magicians of ancient\r\nEgypt to the higher, or Christ self, that has been seen and heard\r\nby the sages and saints of all ages, assuming appropriate symbols,\r\nas in the case of the vision of ``F,'' where the angel of\r\ndeath was assumed.\r\n\r\nTo Paul it appeared as a great personal truth whom he was\r\nrelentlessly persecuting.  To many a wayward son or daughter\r\nof the present time, it appears as a dead relative or friend,\r\nin order to approach the material mind and make its\r\nwarning more effective.\r\n\r\nTo those who were interested in the teachings of Christ, but who after\r\nhis death were inclined to doubt him, this higher self materialized\r\nin the form of the Great Master in order to impress on their material\r\nminds the spiritual import of his teachings.  So, to this day, when doubt\r\nand temptation mar the moral instinct, God, through the spiritual self,\r\nas Job says, approaches man while in deep sleep upon the bed to impress\r\nhis instructions that he may change man from his purpose.\r\n\r\nThe spiritual world always fixes its orbit upon a\r\nstraight line, while the material world is fonder of curves.\r\nWe find man struggling through dreadful marshes and deserts\r\nof charlatanism in order to get a glimpse into his future,\r\ninstead of solicitously following the straight line of inner\r\nconsciousness that connects with the infinite mind, from which,\r\naided by his Church and the healthy action of his own judgment,\r\nhe may receive those helpful spiritual impressions and messages\r\nnecessary to solace the longings of the searching soul.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of the True Master is the straight line.\r\nPythagoras, Plato and Christ created angles by running vertical lines\r\nthrough the ecclesiastical and hypocritical conventionalities of their day.\r\nThe new angles and curves thus produced by the bold philosophy\r\nof the humble Nazarene have confronted with impregnable firmness\r\nduring the intervening ages the sophistry of the Pharisees.\r\n\r\n``In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men,\r\nin slumberings upon the bed; then he openeth the ears of men and sealeth\r\ntheir instruction.  That he may withdraw man from his purpose and hide\r\npride from man.''--JOB 33:15.\r\n\r\n``Man cannot contradict the laws of Nature.  But, are all the laws\r\nof Nature yet understood?''\r\n\r\n``Real philosophy seeks rather to solve than to deny.''--LYTTON.\r\n\r\nThose who live active lives exclude spiritual thought and\r\nfill their minds with the fascinations of worldly affairs,\r\npleasure and business, dream with less frequency than\r\nthose who regard objective matters with lighter concern.\r\nThe former depend alone upon the voluptuous warmth of the world\r\nfor contentment; they look to money, the presence of some one,\r\nor to other external sources for happiness, and are often disappointed;\r\nwhile the latter, with a just appreciation of temporal wants,\r\ndepend alone upon the inner consciousness for that peace\r\nwhich passeth all carnal understanding.\r\n\r\nThey are strengthened, as were Buddha and Christ, by suppressing\r\nthe sensual fires for forty days and nights in the wilderness of trial\r\nand temptation.  They number a few, and are never disappointed,\r\nwhile the former number millions.\r\n\r\nNature is three-fold, so is man; male and female, son or soul.\r\nThe union of one and two produce the triad or the trinity\r\nwhich underlies the philosophy of the ancients.\r\n\r\nMan has a physical or visible body, an atom of the physical or visible earth.\r\nHe has a soul the exact counterpart of his body, but invisible and subjective;\r\nincomplete and imperfect as the external man, or _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nThe soul is not only the son or creation of man, but it is the real man.\r\nIt is the inner imperishable double or imprint of what has outwardly\r\nand inwardly transpired.  All thoughts, desires and actions enter the soul\r\nthrough the objective mind.\r\n\r\nThe automaton of the body responds as quickly to the bat\r\nof the eye as it does to the movement of the whole body.\r\nBy it the foot-steps of man and the very hairs of his head are numbered.\r\nThus it becomes his invisible counterpart.  It is therefore the book\r\nof life or death, and by it he judges himself or is already judged.\r\nWhen it is complete nothing can be added or taken from its personnel.\r\nIt is sometimes partly opened to him in his dreams, but in death\r\nis clearly revealed.\r\n\r\nMan has also a spiritual body, subjective to, and more ethereal\r\nthan the soul.  It is an infinitesimal atom, and is related\r\nin substance to the spiritual or infinite mind of the universe.\r\nJust as the great physical sun, the center of visible light,\r\nlife and heat, is striving to purify the foul miasma of the marsh\r\nand send its luminous messages of love into the dark crevices\r\nof the earth, so the Great Spiritual Sun, of which the former\r\nis a visible prototype or reflection, is striving to illuminate\r\nwith Divine Wisdom the personal soul and mind of man, thus enabling\r\nhim to become cognizant of the spiritual or Christ presence within.\r\n\r\nThe heresy and Herod of wanton flesh, degenerate victim of\r\nthe sensuous filth and fermentation of self-indulgence, is ever\r\nstriving to exile and suppress, from the wilderness of sin,\r\nthe warning cry of the Nazarite voice by intriguing with the cunning,\r\nincestuous daughters of unholy thoughts and desires.\r\n\r\nThe objective mind is most active when the body is awake.\r\nThe subjective influences are most active, and often fill\r\nthe mind with impressions, while the physical body is asleep.\r\nThe spiritual intelligence can only intrude itself when\r\nthe human will is suspended, or passive to external states.\r\nA man who lives only on the sensual plane will receive his\r\nknowledge through the senses, and will not, while in that state,\r\nreceive spiritual impressions or warning dreams.\r\n\r\nMen and women rarely ever degrade themselves so low that\r\nthe small voice of the desert does not bring them a message.\r\nSodom and Gomorrah, vile with the debauchery of a nameless crime,\r\nwere not deserted by the angel of love until the fire\r\nwhich they had lighted in their souls had consumed them.\r\nThe walls of Jericho did not fall until Rahab, the harlot,\r\nhad been saved and the inmates had heard for several days\r\nthe ram's-horn and the tramp of Joshua's infantry.\r\n\r\nThe evangelist Jonah, the Sam Jones of Hebrew theology,\r\nexhorted the adulterous Nineveh many times to repentance\r\nbefore it fell.\r\n\r\nDavid, while intoxicated with the wine of love, from languishing\r\nin the seductive embrace of the beautiful bathing nymph, Bathsheba,\r\nheard the voice of Nathan.  Surely God is no respecter of persons,\r\nand will speak to all classes if the people will not stiffen their\r\nnecks or harden their hearts.\r\n\r\nWomen dream more often and more vividly than men, because their dream\r\ncomposition is less influenced and allied to external environments.\r\n\r\nAll dreams possess an element of warning or prescience;\r\nsome more than others.  This is unknown to the many, but is known\r\nto the observing few.  There are many people who have no natural\r\ntaste for music, and who do not know one note from another.\r\nThere are also those who cannot distinguish one color from another.\r\nTo the former there is no harmony of sound, and to the latter\r\nthere is no blending of colors.\r\n\r\nThey are heard and seen, but there is no artistic recognition of the same.\r\nStill it would be absurd to say to either the musician or the artist:\r\nyour art is false and is only an illusion of the senses.\r\n\r\nOne man apparently never dreams; another dreams occasionally,\r\nand still another more frequently; none atttempt{sic} to interpret\r\ntheir dream, or to observe what follows; therefore, the verdict is,\r\n``There is nothing in dreams.''  (Schopenhauer aptly says:\r\n``No man can see over his own height.... Intellect is invisible\r\nto the man who has none.'') The first is like the blind man who\r\ndenies the existence of light, because he does not perceive it.\r\nThe second and third resemble the color-blind man, who sees\r\nbut who persists in calling green blue, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nA fourth man sees in a dream a friend walking in his room;\r\nthe vision is so vivid he instantly gets up and strikes a match.\r\nAfter making sure there is no intruder about the room he looks\r\nat his watch and goes back to bed.  The next day he receives\r\nthe unwelcome tidings that his friend died at the exact moment\r\nof the vision.\r\n\r\nAt another time he hears in his dream a familiar voice cry out in agony.\r\nSoon he hears of a shocking accident or distressing illness befalling\r\nthe one whose voice he recognized in the dream.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] For authentic records, see Flammarion's ``Unknown.''\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third man, already referred to, has about the same dream experiences,\r\nbut calls them strange coincidences or unconscious cerebration, etc.\r\n\r\nAgain, the fourth man dreams of walking through green fields\r\nof corn, grass or wheat.  He notes after such dreams prosperous\r\nconditions follow for at least a few days.  He also notes,\r\nif the area over which he passes is interspersed with rocks or other\r\nadverse signs, good and bad follow in the wake of the dream.\r\nIf he succeeds in climbing a mountain and finds the top barren\r\nhe will accomplish his object, but the deal will prove unprofitable.\r\nIf it is green and spring-like in appearance, it will yield good results.\r\nIf he sees muddy water, sickness, business depression or causes\r\nfor jealousy may develop.\r\n\r\nA nightmare suggests to the dreamer to be careful of health and diet,\r\nto relax his whole body, to sleep with his arms down and keep plenty\r\nof fresh air in the room.\r\n\r\nHe sums up the foregoing with a thousand similar dream incidents,\r\nand is led to believe certain dreams possess an element of warning.\r\n\r\nThere are three pure types of dreams, namely, _subjective_,\r\n_physical_ and _spiritual_.  They relate to the past,\r\npresent and future, and are influenced by past or subjective,\r\nphysical and spiritual causes.  The latter is always deeply prophetic,\r\nespecially when it leaves a vivid impression on the conscious mind.\r\nThe former, too, possesses an element of warning and prophecy,\r\nthough the true meaning is hidden in symbols or allegory.\r\nThey are due to contingent mental pictures of the past\r\nfalling upon the conscious mind of the dreamer.\r\nThus he is back at the old home, and finds mother pale and aged,\r\nor ruddy and healthy, and the lawn withered or green.\r\nIt all augurs, according to the aspect the picture assumes,\r\nill or good fortune.\r\n\r\nPhysical dreams are more or less unimportant.  They are usually\r\nsuperinduced by the anxious waking mind, and when this is so they\r\npossess no prophetic significance.\r\n\r\nDreams induced by opiates, fevers, mesmerism and ill health come under\r\nthis class.  A man who gambles is liable to dream of cards; if he dreams\r\nof them in deep sleep the warning is to be heeded; but if it comes\r\nas a reverie while he sleeps lightly he should regard it as worthless.\r\nSuch dreams reflect only the present condition of the body and mind\r\nof the dreamer; but as the past and present enter into shaping the future,\r\nthe reflections thus left on the waking mind should not go by unheeded.\r\n\r\nWe often observe matters of dress and exterior appearance through mirrors,\r\nand we soon make the necessary alterations to put our bodies in harmony\r\nwith existing formalities.  Then, why not study more seriously the mental\r\nimages reflected from the mirror of the soul upon our minds through the occult\r\nprocesses within us?\r\n\r\nThirdly, the spiritual dreams are brought about by the higher self penetrating\r\nthe soul realm, and reflecting upon the waking mind approaching events.\r\nWhen we put our animal mind and soul in harmony with our higher self we\r\nbecome one with it, and, therefore, one with the universal mind or will by\r\nbecoming a part of it.  It is through the higher self we reach the infinite.\r\nIt is through the lower self we fall into the whirlpool of matter.\r\n\r\nThese dreams are a part of the universal mind until they\r\ntranspire in the life of man.  After this they go to make a part\r\nof the personal soul.  Whatever has not taken place in the mind,\r\nor life of man, belongs exclusively to the impersonal mind.\r\nBut as soon as a man lives or sees a thing, that thing\r\ninstantly becomes a part of his soul; hence, the clairvoyant,\r\nor mind reader, never perceives beyond the personal ego,\r\nas the future belongs exclusively to God or the universal mind,\r\nand has no material, subjective existence; therefore, it cannot\r\nbe known except through the channels of the higher self,\r\nwhich is the Truth or the Word that is constantly striving\r\nto manifest itself through the flesh.\r\n\r\nOur psychical research people give us conclusive proof of mental\r\ntelepathy or telegraphy between finite minds.  Thus communications\r\nor impressions are conveyed many miles from one mind to another.\r\nThis phenomenon is easier when one or both of the subjects are\r\nin a state of somnambulence or asleep.\r\n\r\nIn thought transference or mind reading it is absolutely\r\nnecessary to have a positive and a negative subject.\r\nThrough the same law that mental impressions are telegraphed\r\nfrom one finite mind to another a man may place himself in harmony\r\nwith the infinite mind and thus receive true and healthful\r\nwarnings of coming evil or good.  Homer, Aristotle and other\r\nwriters of the ancient classics thought this not improbable.\r\n\r\nThe statesman, the poet, the philosopher of the Bible were\r\nunanimous in attaching prophetic significance to dreams.\r\nHas the law of ethereal vibrations undergone any recent\r\nchanges to debar or molest the communion of the soul with its\r\nspiritual father, any more than it has debarred contact with its\r\nmaterial mother or environments?\r\n\r\nWe only understand the great laws of nature by effects.\r\nWe know that vegetation planted in native soil and properly attended\r\nwith light, heat and moisture, will grow and yield a certain\r\nspecies of fruit.  We may infer how it does this, but we cannot\r\nexplain the process of transformation any more than we can explain\r\nwhy certain tropical birds are burnished with glowing colors,\r\nand that other birds under the murky skies are gray and brown,\r\nwhile in the Arctic regions they bleach.\r\n\r\nIn sleep we see, without being awakened, the angry lightning rend\r\nthe midnight clouds, and hear the explosive thunder hurl its fury at us;\r\nbut can we explain it any more than our scientist can explain the natural\r\nforces of thought, of love and hate, or the subtle intuition of woman?\r\n\r\nWhat of the silhouette or the anthelion of the Scandinavian Alps,\r\nand the aerial cities so often seen by explorers and travelers?\r\nDo not they defy the law of optics?  Must we understand the intricacies\r\nof articulation and the forces back of it before we can appropriate speech?\r\nMust we discard all belief in an infinite mind because we cannot\r\nunderstand it, and therefore say we are not a part of it because there\r\nis no Infinite?  Should we discard the belief in the infinitude of number,\r\nbecause we cannot understand it, and therefore say that finite number\r\nis not a part of the infinite?\r\n\r\nNo scientist or naturalist is so grossly stupid as to deny\r\nthe infinite expansion of numbers?  If this be so, it establishes\r\nthe infinite of number, of which every finite number is a part,\r\nand thus we have a parallel in mathematics, the very cornerstone\r\nof the exact sciences, for a finite and an infinite mind.\r\nIt is from the prototype of this infinite of number, namely,\r\nthe infinite of intelligence, that spiritual dreams proceed.\r\nThey are, therefore, the reflection of truth upon the dream mind\r\nand occur with less frequency than do dreams of the other two classes.\r\n\r\nThere are also mixed dreams, due to a multitude of incidents\r\narising from one or more sources, which being reflected upon\r\nthe mind at the same instant, produce an incoherent effect similar\r\nto that which might be produced by running the same newspaper\r\nthrough two or more presses all of different size type.\r\n\r\nAgain, if you sit before a mirror where flashlights of faces and\r\nother things are reflected simultaneously and instantly removed,\r\nyou will fail to obtain a well-defined impression of what passed\r\nbefore your mind.\r\n\r\nIf you should pass on a train, at the speed of two miles a minute,\r\nthrough a forest of flowers and trees, your mind would be unable\r\nto distinguish one flower or tree from another.\r\n\r\nIt is in a similar way dream life and incidents may fall upon the mind.\r\n\r\nA woman may dream of receiving a letter, and in the same connection see\r\nmuddy water, or an arid landscape.  Closely following, in waking life,\r\nshe is astonished to receive a letter in about the same manner of her dream,\r\nbut the muddy water and the arid landscape are missing.\r\n\r\nThis is a mixed dream and is due to more than one cause.\r\nThe first part is literal in its fulfilment, and belongs to\r\nthe spiritual class; the other part of the dream is subjective,\r\nand therefore allegorical in meaning.  Together with the letter,\r\nit was a forewarning of misfortune.\r\n\r\nThese dreams are more difficult of interpretation than those\r\nbelonging to the spiritual type.  In such dreams you may see water,\r\nletters, houses, money, people, and countless other things.\r\nThe next day you may cross water or receive a letter; the other\r\nthings you may not see, but annoyance or pleasure will follow.\r\n\r\nAgain, you may have a similar dream and not receive a letter or cross water,\r\nbut the waking life will be filled with the other dream pictures and you will\r\nexperience disappointing or pleasant surprises as are indicated by the letter\r\nor water sign.\r\n\r\nI have selected the allegorical type of dreams for the subject of this work.\r\nDreams that are common occurrences and are thought by the world\r\nto be meaningless.\r\n\r\nI have endeavored, through the occult forces in and about me\r\nto find their esoteric or hidden import.\r\n\r\n_Dreams transpire on the subjective plane.  They should therefore\r\nbe interpreted by subjective intelligence_.  This, though burdened\r\nwith many business cares, I have honestly endeavored to do.\r\nThrough the long hours of many nights I have waited patiently\r\nand passively the automatic movement of my hand to write\r\nthe subjective definitions without receiving a word or a single\r\nmanifestation of intelligence, and again the mysterious forces\r\nwould write as fast as my hand could move over the paper.\r\n\r\nI will leave it for my readers to draw their own conclusions\r\nas to whether automatic writing is the work of extraneous spirits,\r\nthrough the brain and intelligence of the medium, or the result\r\nof auto-suggestive influence upon the subjective personality.\r\n\r\nIt is argued by the Materialist, with some degree of strength,\r\nthat the healthy man does not dream, This is, perhaps, true, in a way,\r\nbut the whole man comprises the past, present, and future.  The past\r\nand future always embrace more of the conditions that surround him than\r\nthe present.  The present is only the acute stage, while the chronic stage,\r\nconsidered from a personal view, is the past and future combined.\r\nMan cannot eliminate entirely these states from himself, for, while they\r\nare past and future to the personal mind, they are ever present\r\nto the higher subjective senses; he is, therefore, never in perfect\r\nhealth unless these states are in harmony with the present.\r\nThe personal self, in a normal state, cannot free itself from the past\r\nor from the anxieties of the future.\r\n\r\nThe reader should ever keep before his mind the fact that no man\r\never had the same dream twice.  He may have had very similar dreams,\r\nbut some detail will be missing.  Nature seems to abhor duplicates.\r\nYou could no more find two dreams alike than you could find facsimiles\r\nin two blades of grass.  A man cannot live two days exactly alike.\r\nDifferent influences and passions will possess him.  Consequently, no two\r\ndreams can be had under exactly the same influences.  Stereotypes are\r\npeculiarly the invention of man and not of God or nature.\r\n\r\nSince it is impossible to find a man twice in exactly the same\r\nmental state, it is equally impossible for him to dream the same\r\ndream twice; therefore, it is only possible to approximate\r\ndream interpretation by classing them into families.\r\nThis I have attempted to do in a more comprehensive way than\r\nother writers who have preceded me.\r\n\r\nAll men are acquainted with health and sickness, love and hate,\r\nsuccess and failure.  Sickness, hate and failure belong to kindred families,\r\nand often ally their forces in such a way that it is hard to say whether\r\nthe dreamer will fail in love, health or some business undertaking.\r\nBut at all times a bad symbol is a warning of evil, though that evil may\r\nbe minimized or exaggerated, or _vice versa_, according as signs are good.\r\n\r\nThus, if the dream symbol indicates wealth or fortune to the peasant,\r\nhis waking life may be gladdened by receiving or seeing a fifty-cent piece,\r\nor finding assuring work, while the same symbol to a wealthy man would\r\nmean many dollars, or a favorable turn in affairs.\r\n\r\nIt is the same in physical life.  A man may hear the sound of a wagon.\r\nHe cannot determine by the rattle of the wheels whether it is laden\r\nwith laundry, groceries or dry goods.  He may judge as to its size\r\nand whether it is bearing a heavy or a light burden.  When it\r\nobjectifies he will be able to know its full import and not before.\r\nSo with dream symbols.  We may know they are fraught with evil or good,\r\nas in the case of Pilate's wife, but we cannot tell their full meaning\r\nuntil their reflections materialize before the objective sense.\r\n\r\nDeath is more frequently foretold by dream messages or visions,\r\nas explained in another part of this chapter.\r\n\r\nDuring sleep the will is suspended, leaving the mind often a prey\r\nto its own fancy.  The slightest attack of an enemy may be foretold\r\nby the unbridled imagination exaggerating the mental picture into\r\na monstrous shark or snake, when, indeed, a much less portentous\r\nsign was cast from the dream mold.\r\n\r\nA woman may see a serpent in waking life and through fright lose reason\r\nor self-control. She imagines it pursues her when in reality it is going\r\nan opposite direction; in a like way dreams may be many times unreal.\r\n\r\nThe mind loses its reason or will in sleep, but a supersensitive\r\nperception is awakened, and, as it regains consciousness from sleep,\r\nthe sound of a knock on the wall may be magnified into a pistol shot.\r\n\r\nThe sleeping mind is not only supersensitive as to existing external sounds\r\nand light, but it frequently sees hours and days ahead of the waking mind.\r\n\r\nNor is this contradictory to the laws of nature.  The ant housed\r\nin the depth of the earth, away from atmospheric changes,\r\nknows of the approach of the harvest, and comes forth to lay\r\nby his store.\r\n\r\nIn a like manner, the pet squirrel is a better barometer of the local weather\r\nthan the Weather Bureau.  With unerring foresight, when a wintry frown nowhere\r\nmars the horizon, he is able to apprehend a cold wave twenty-four hours ahead,\r\nand build his house accordingly.\r\n\r\nSo in sleep, man dreams the future by intuitive perception of invisible\r\nsigns or influences, while awake he reasons it out by cause and effect.\r\nThe former seems to be the law of the spiritual world, while the latter\r\nwould appear to be the law of the material world.  Man should not depend\r\nalone upon either.  Together they proclaim the male and female principle\r\nof existence and should find harmonious consummation.\r\n\r\nIn this manner only can man hope to achieve that perfect normal\r\nstate to which the best thought of the human race is aspiring,\r\nwhere he can create and control influences instead of being\r\ncreated and controlled by them, as the majority of us are at\r\nthe present day.\r\n\r\nGod, the highest subjective source of intelligence, may in a\r\ndream leave impressions or presentiments on the mind of man,\r\nthe highest objective source of intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe physical sun sends its light into the dark corners of the earth,\r\nand God, the Spiritual Sun, imparts spiritual light into the passive\r\nand receptive soul.\r\n\r\nMan, by hiding in a cave, or closing the windows and doors of his house,\r\nmay shut out all physical light; so he may steep his soul in sensual\r\ndebauchery until all spiritual light is shut out.\r\n\r\nJust as the vital essence of the soil, the mother of nature,\r\nmay be extracted by abuse, either from omission or commission,\r\nuntil neither the light of the sun, nor the moisture of the heavens\r\nwill wake the flush of life, so may the spiritual essence\r\nbe deadened when the soil of the soul is filled with the aged\r\nand multiplying weeds of ravishing materiality.\r\n\r\nThe dream mind is often influenced by the waking mind.\r\nWhen the waking mind dwells upon any subject, the dream mind\r\nis more or less influenced by it, and it often assists the waking\r\nmind in solving difficult problems.  The personal future,\r\nembodied in the active states of the universal mind,\r\nmay affect the dream mind, producing premonitions of death,\r\naccidents and misfortune.\r\n\r\nThe objective mind rejoices or laments over the aspects of the past\r\nand present, while the spiritual mind, striving with the personal future,\r\neither laments or rejoices over the prospective conditions.\r\n\r\nOne is the barometer of the past, while the other is the barometer\r\nof the future.\r\n\r\nIf we study carefully the spiritual impressions left upon the dream mind,\r\nthrough the interpretations of this book, we will be able to shape our future\r\nin accordance with spiritual law.\r\n\r\nThus our temporal events will contribute to our spiritual development,\r\nand in turn our spiritual knowledge will contribute to our temporal welfare.\r\nWithout this harmonious interaction of the two great forces in man,\r\nthe Divine plan of destiny cannot be reached.\r\n\r\nThis can only be accomplished through the material mind\r\nor reason dominating the animal emotions of the heart.\r\nIn this way we would not covet our neighbor's goods, or grow\r\nangry with our brother over trifles.\r\n\r\nThe house vacated by the sefish{sic} appetites of the world would\r\nbe filled with the whispers of spiritual love and wisdom necessary\r\nto the mutual welfare and development of body and soul.\r\n\r\nThe theory used in this book to interpret dreams is both simple and rational.\r\nBy the using of it you will be surprised to find so many of the predictions\r\nfulfilled in your waking life.  We deal with both the thought and the dream.\r\nThe thought or sign implied in the object dreamed of and the influence\r\nsurrounding it are always considered in the interpretation.\r\n\r\nThoughts proceed from the visible mind and dreams from the invisible mind.\r\nThe average waking mind receives and retains only a few of the lessons\r\nof life.  It is largely filled with idle and incoherent thoughts that\r\nare soon forgotten.  The same may be truly said of the dream mind.\r\nMany of our day thoughts are day dreams, just as many of our night dreams\r\nare night thoughts.  Our day deeds of evil or good pierce or soothe\r\nthe conscience, just as our night symbols of sorrow and joy sadden or please\r\nthe objective senses.  Our day's thoughts are filled with the warnings\r\nand presence of the inner mind and our night's thoughts are tinctured\r\nand often controlled by our external mind.\r\n\r\nSome writer has said:  ``Everything that exists upon earth has its\r\nethereal counterpart.''  Christ said:  ``As a man thinketh so is he.''\r\nA Hindu proverb says:  ``Man is a creature of reflection; he becomes\r\nthat upon which he reflects.''  A modern metaphysicist says:\r\n``Our thoughts are real substance and leave their images upon\r\nour personality, they fill our aura with beauty or ugliness according\r\nto our intents and purposes in life.''  Each evil thought or action\r\nhas its pursuing phantom, each smile or kindly deed its guiding angel,\r\nwe leave wherever we ignobly stand, a tomb and an epitaph to haunt\r\nus through the furnace of conscience and memory.\r\n\r\nClosely following in the wake of our multiplying evil thoughts are armies\r\nof these ghastly spectres pursuing each other with the exact intents\r\nand purposes of the mind that gave them being.  If we consider well these\r\nfacts we will be forced into thinking our best thoughts at all times.\r\nThoughts are the subjective and creative force that produces action.\r\nAction is the objective effect of thought; hence the character of our daily\r\nthoughts is making our failure or success of to-morrow.\r\n\r\nThe impersonal mind deals with all time and things as ever present.\r\nThe objective mind is constantly striving to penetrate\r\nthe spiritual realm, while the spiritual mind is striving to\r\nenter matter, hence our actions have their subjective counterparts\r\nand their subethereal counterparts.  The universal mind,\r\nin harmony with the evolutionary plans and laws of the macrocosms,\r\nmaterializes through functions of the microcosm, imparting to each,\r\nwith its routine of failure and success, its daily objectivity.\r\nThe inner or passive dream mind may perceive the subjective types\r\nor antitypes many days before they objectify through the microcosm.\r\nTheir meaning is often wrapt in symbols, but sometimes\r\nthe actual as it occurs in objective life is conveyed.\r\nOur own thought images which have passed before the objective mind\r\nmay be perceived by the clever mind reader, but those antitypes\r\nwhich are affecting our future, but which have none other\r\nbut subjective existence, are rarely ever perceived by any one\r\nexcept by the power of the higher self or the spirit within.\r\nFor this reason we are enjoined by the sages to study self.\r\nWith the physical mind we only see physical objects,\r\nwith the subjective mind we see only subjective objects.\r\nThis was Paul's doctrine and it is the belief of the best\r\npsychic thought of this century.  By means of our reason--\r\nan objective process for divining the future--aided by mathematical\r\nand geographical data, we may outline the storm centers and the path\r\nof the rain days before they appear in certain localities.\r\nAfter eliminating all contingencies arising from clerical\r\nerror and counteracting influence, the prognostication is sure\r\nof fulfilment.  For centuries ahead the astronomer foretells\r\nthe eclipse of the moon and the sun and the arrival of comets.\r\nHe does not do this by crossing the borderland dividing the spiritual\r\nfrom the physical world.  In a like manner the subjective\r\nforces operate upon their own planes and know very little\r\neven of their own corporal realm, just as our physical senses\r\nknow little, if anything, of the soul or spiritual habitation.\r\nThey know that by gross living the sense of conscience may\r\nbe dulled, or that by right living it may be strengthened.\r\nIn like manner the subjective mind perceives by its own senses\r\ncertain invisible types of evil seeking external manifestations\r\nin the microcosm.  It knows that these forms of error will work\r\nharm to the objective mind, and that if persisted in they\r\nwill pervert all intercourse or interchange of counsel between\r\nthe two factions of the man.  In this there is no spiritual\r\nperception of physical objects, any more than there is in mundane\r\nlife a sense perception of spiritual images and antitypes.\r\nThe former only sees the forms that manifest on its plane,\r\nwhile the latter can note only those common to its sphere.\r\nEach may recognize and feel the violence or good that these\r\nmanifestations will do to their respective counterparts,\r\nbut we have no reason to believe that normal objective or\r\nsubjective states have visional powers beyond their own plane.\r\nThe mind of man acting upon the mind of the macrocosm will produce,\r\naccording as he thinks or acts, antitypes of good or evil in\r\nthe imagination of the world which is reflected upon the spiritual\r\naura of the microcosm previous to taking on corporal form.\r\nWhile in this state they may be perceived by subjectivity,\r\nand thus the images seen are impressed on the dream mind\r\nduring sleep, or on the passivity of the objective sense.\r\n\r\nEvil or righteous acts recently committed will more acutely affect\r\nthe present waking mind than those enacted at a more remote period.\r\nIn a similar way future disaster or success which is soon to occur\r\nwill impress the dream mind more vividly than those which are\r\nto transpire at a later date.  But in the lives of all men there\r\nare past incidents which they will never forget, and which\r\nwill never cease to fill their hearts with pride or remorse.\r\nSo, too, in their distant future there are important events\r\nto transpire which are struggling through tumultuous infinitude\r\nto leave their ghastly or smiling impress upon the dream mind.\r\nIf your mental states are passive you will receive the warnings.\r\nThere are cases on record which show events have been forecast\r\nyears ahead of their occurrence.\r\n\r\nWe do not claim that this book will prove an interpreter of all dreams,\r\nor that the keys disclosed will open to you all the mysteries of the future,\r\nor even all those surrounding your own personality, but by studying\r\nthe definitions and the plane upon which they were written, you will be able,\r\nthrough the power of your own spirit, to interpret your own dreams.\r\nThe combination of dream and dream influences are as infinite as the stars,\r\nor the combination of thought and number.  They can only be classed\r\nand considered as such.  They cannot be analyzed in detail or as a whole.\r\nIn mathematics we have nine digits from which an infinite variety\r\nof combinations may be formed and solved by the deduction of the mind.\r\nThrough them we may measure time, space, quality and quantity.\r\n\r\nThe symbol o and I exist by reason of _no thing_ and _some\r\nthing_ or death and life.  The figure one is subject to\r\nillimitable expansion.  It is without beginning in the infinite\r\nof number, as God is without beginning in the infinite of being.\r\nAs with the vegetable kingdom, the tiny seed or acorn silently\r\nworking its magical transformation into a plant or tree,\r\nand directing its destiny with marvelous intelligence\r\nthrough the torrid and frigid vicissitudes of the seasons;\r\nso is man without beginning in the infinitude of his own\r\nbeing or microcosm.  Man is both a type and antitype.\r\nA type of what pre-existed in the imagination of the world, and an\r\nantitype of a future life yet to manifest itself on another plane\r\nwhere the incidents of the one will be subjective, as the events\r\noccurring in infancy or in other planes are now subjective.\r\nHis dreams, thoughts and actions, and the influences that\r\nproduce them and their multiplying combination, cannot be\r\nnumbered or reproduced any more than you can number the leaves\r\nof the forest, or find two exactly similar units among them.\r\nThus the full meaning or interpretation of dreams cannot be fully\r\ndemonstrated through mental or even spiritual stereotypes.\r\nBut by the intelligent use of this book you will be able to trace\r\nout almost any dream combination and arrive at the true nature\r\nof its portent.\r\n\r\nA wise doctor, in preparing medicine for a patient,\r\nconsiders well his age, temperament and his present condition.\r\nSo should the interpreter of dreams ponder well the mental state,\r\nthe health, habits and temperament of the dreamer.\r\nThese things no one can know so well as the dreamer himself.\r\nHe, therefore, with the aid of this book, will be able to interpret\r\nhis dreams by the light that is in him.\r\n\r\nMan is the microcosm or a miniature world.  He has a soul and\r\nmental firmament, bounded by the stellar dust and the milky way,\r\nand filled with the mystery of suns, satellites and stars.\r\nThese he can study best by the astronomy of induction and introspection.\r\nHe has also a physical plane, diversified by oceans,\r\nlakes, rivers, fertile valleys, waste places and mountains.\r\nAll are in cosmic interdependency as they are in the macrocosm.\r\nHere rests the mystery of being--the grandest of subjects!\r\nThe student is no less bewildered and awed than the geologist\r\nwho gropes blindly through the seams of the earth searching\r\nfor links in the infinite chain of knowledge, or the astronomer\r\nsweeping the heavens of the macrocosm in quest of new phenomena.\r\nThe two planes are dependent upon each other.  It is the smile\r\nor disease of the firmament that blesses or diseases the earth.\r\nIt is likewise the impure firmament of the microcosm that diseases\r\nthe body and soul.  If it reflects the drought of thought or the\r\nvarious states of evil, deserts will enlarge, forest of infectious,\r\nvenomous growth will form the habitation of lust and murder.\r\nBefore great moral or physical revolutions or catastrophes occur,\r\nclouds will darken the horizon of the dream mind; storms will gather,\r\nlurid flames of lightning will flash their volatile anger;\r\nthe explosive thunder will recklessly carry on its bombardment;\r\nbells will ring, strange knocking will be heard--symbols of a message--\r\nphantom forms will be seen, familiar voices will call and plead\r\nwith you, unknown visitors will threaten you, unearthly struggles\r\nwith hideous giants and agonies of mind and body will possess you;\r\nmalformations of the most hideous type will seize your vision;\r\nshrouded in sheets of a whitish vapor, evanescent specters,\r\nwith pallid face and of warning countenance, will cling around you,\r\nand contagion and famine will leave their desolate impress upon\r\nthe flower of health and in the field of plenty.  Thus all of us\r\nwould be nightly warned in our circle or miniature world if we\r\nwould develop subjective strength to retain the impressions left\r\nupon our dream mind.  But in spite of all reason and conscience--\r\nin spite of the inductive knowledge received through our senses--\r\nwe go on from day to day, and step by step, feeding our soul\r\non the luscious fruit of the outward senses, until the rank\r\nweeds of sefishness{sic} have choked out all other forces.\r\nThus the soul is filled with thought images that assume the form\r\nof vicious animals, homely visaged fowls, rabid and snarling\r\ncats and dogs, leprous and virile serpents, cankerous lizards,\r\nslimy intestine worms, hairy and malicious insects.\r\nThey are generated by greed, envy, jealousy, covetousness, backbiting,\r\namorous longings and other impure thoughts.  With the soul filled\r\nwith this conglomeration of virus and filth, why doubt a hell and its\r\ncounterpart condition, or expect the day or night to bring happiness?\r\nIf evil thoughts will infest the soul with ravenous microbes,\r\ngood thoughts and deeds will starve and suppress their activity,\r\nand create a heaven to supplant them.  With this grand and eternal\r\ntruth in view, man should ever think kindly of those about him,\r\ncontrol his temper in word and action, seek his own, think the best\r\nof thoughts, study to relieve the worthy poor, seek solace in the depth\r\nof being, and let gentleness and meekness characterize his life.\r\nThen will he sow the seeds of a present and future heaven.\r\nHis day thoughts and his night thoughts in harmony will point\r\nwith unerring forecast to a peaceful end.  Spiritual and helpful\r\nwarnings will fall upon the dream mind, as gently as dew upon\r\nthe flowers and as softly as a mother's kiss upon the lips of love.\r\nWhen our external lives are guided by the forces within,\r\nsweet are the words and messages from our own spirit;\r\nfor those who are truly blessed are those who seek divine love\r\nthrough the channels of their inner world of consciousness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{illust. caption = A DIAGRAM GIVING THE THEORY OF THIS BOOK,\r\nAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MICROCOSM AND THE MACROCOSM.\r\n\r\nFRAGMENTARY THOUGHTS FROM DREAM REALMS:}\r\n\r\n\r\nMan is a little circle or world composed of the infinitesimal atoms thrown\r\noff from the great circle or parent world, and fitting into his place\r\nin the zone of life.  If in the revolutions of the great circle he catches\r\nmore material he increases his circle to objective or subjective growth:\r\nif he absorbs spiritual or mind atoms as they fall from the great body\r\nof creative source, he enlarges or contracts his own circle according\r\nto the assimilation of the food he receives from the parent.\r\n\r\nIt is optional with man to obtain spiritual or material manna\r\nas it is disseminated throughout existence.  To feed on material\r\ndiet alone, contracts and distorts the circle of the man;\r\nbut a full comprehension of the needs of the circle, a proper\r\ndenial of supply to some of the compounds, together with a tender\r\ncare of other parts, will round out the whole into a perfect\r\nphysical and mental circle of life.\r\n\r\nDissentious and conflicting results should be avoided in computing\r\nthe length and breadth of the compounded circle of man's individual world.\r\nObjective life is one of the smallest compounds in real life.\r\n\r\nDream life is fuller of meaning and teaching of the inner, or God life,\r\nthan is the exterior life of man.  The mind receives education\r\nfrom communing with the dream composition in the great circle.\r\nConsult with your whole nature or circle before beginning a serious work;\r\npartial consultations, or material advice only, often brings defeat\r\nof objects sought, when a true home counsel would have brought success\r\nand consequent happiness.\r\n\r\nMan should live in his subjective realms and study more his\r\nrelation to other compositions or circles; thus fructifying\r\nand making beautiful his own world through intercourse with\r\nothers who have worked in the great storehouse of subjectivity,\r\nand who have climbed already from the basement into the light\r\nof spiritual sunshine.\r\n\r\n* * * *\r\n\r\nA FEW QUESTIONS AND SUBJECTIVE ANSWERS REGARDING DREAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTION.--What is a dream?\r\n\r\nANSWER--A dream is an event transpiring in that world belonging to the mind\r\nwhen the objective senses have withdrawn into rest or oblivion.\r\n\r\nThen the spiritual man is living alone in the future or ahead\r\nof objective life and consequently lives man's future first,\r\ndeveloping conditions in a way that enables waking man to shape\r\nhis actions by warnings, so as to make life a perfect existence.\r\n\r\nQ.--What relationship is sustained between the average man and his dreams?\r\n\r\nA.--A dream to the average or sensual person, bears the same relation to his\r\nobjective life that it maintained in the case of the ideal dreamer, but it\r\nmeans pleasures, sufferings and advancements on a lower or material plane.\r\n\r\nQ.--Then why is man not always able to correctly interpret his dreams?\r\n\r\nA.--Just as words fail sometimes to express ideas, so dreams fail\r\nsometimes in their mind pictures to portray coming events.\r\n\r\nQ.--If they relate to the future, why is it we so often dream\r\nof the past?\r\n\r\nA.--When a person dreams of past events, those events are warnings of evil\r\nor good; sometimes they are stamped so indelibly upon the subjective mind\r\nthat the least tendency of the waking mind to the past throws these pictures\r\nin relief on the dream consciousness.\r\n\r\nQ.--Why is it that present environments often influence our dreams?\r\n\r\nA.--Because the future of man is usually affected by the present,\r\nso if he mars the present by wilful wrongs, or makes it bright\r\nby right living it will necessarily have influence on his dreams,\r\nas they are forecastings of the future.\r\n\r\nQ.--What is an apparition?\r\n\r\nA.--It is the subjective mind stored with the wisdom gained from futurity,\r\nand in its strenuous efforts to warn its present habitation--\r\nthe corporal body--of dangers just ahead, takes on the shape of a dear\r\none as the most effective method of imparting this knowledge.\r\n\r\nQ.--How does subjectivity deal with time?\r\n\r\nA.--There is no past and future to subjectivity.\r\nIt is all one living present.\r\n\r\nQ.--If that is so, why can't you tell us accurately of our future\r\nas you do of our past?\r\n\r\nA.--Because events are like a procession; they pass a few at a time\r\nand cast a shadow on subjective minds, and those which have passed\r\nbefore the waking mind are felt by other minds also and necessarily\r\nmake a more lasting impression on the subjective mind.\r\n\r\n* * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.--To illustrate:  A person on retiring or closing his eyes had a face\r\nappear to him, the forehead well formed but the lower parts distorted.\r\nExplain this phenomenon?\r\n\r\nA.--A changed state from perfect sleep or waking possessed him.\r\n\r\nNow, the man's face was only the expression of his real\r\nthoughts and the state of his business combined.\r\nHis thoughts were strong and healthy, but his business fagging,\r\nhence his own spirit is not a perfect likeness of his own soul,\r\nas it takes every atom of earthly composition perfectly normal\r\nto reproduce a perfect spirit picture of the soul or mortal man.\r\nHe would have seen a true likeness of himself had conditions\r\nbeen favorable; thus a man knows when a complete whole is\r\nhis portion.  Study to make surroundings always harmonious.\r\nLife is only being perfectly carried on when these conditions\r\nare in unison.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO DEVELOP THE POWER TO DREAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeep the mind clear and as free from material rubbish as is\r\npossible and go to sleep in a negative condition (this will,\r\nof course, have to be cultivated by the subject). A person can,\r\nif he will, completely relax his mind and body to the receptive\r\nmood required for dreams to appear as realities, or true\r\nexplanations of future events.\r\n\r\n* * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nTo dream you are conversing with a dead relative, and that\r\nrelative endeavors to extract a promise from you, warns you\r\nof coming distress unless you follow the advice given.\r\nDisastrous consequences could be averted if minds could grasp\r\nthe inner workings and sight of the higher or spiritual self.\r\nThe voice of relatives is only that higher self taking form to approach\r\nmore distinctly the mind that lives near the material plane.\r\nThere is so little congeniality between common or material\r\nnatures that persons should depend more largely upon their own\r\nsubjectivity for true contentment and pleasure.\r\n\r\n* * * *\r\n\r\nDREAMS EXAGGERATED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe will is suspended during sleep, so the dream mind is more a prey\r\nto excitability than the waking mind.\r\n\r\nThus when images appear upon the dream vision they are frequently distorted\r\ninto hideous malformations that fill it with fear and excitement.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTRARY DREAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe constant dwelling of the mind upon certain things distorts\r\ntheir shapes upon subjectivity, thus throwing dreams in exactly\r\nopposite channels to the waking reality.  Yet the dreamer always\r\nfeels a sense of being awake in dreams like these, and on awakening\r\nexperiences no recuperation of mind or body after such contrary dreams,\r\nSleep is not fully sustained while the dreamer is held by material\r\nideas in the subjective state.\r\n\r\n* * * *\r\n\r\nWHEN DREAMS ARE LESS PRESCIENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cessation of the organs to perform healthful functions converts\r\na man into a different person, and dreams while in this state would\r\nhave no prophetic meaning, unless to warn the dreamer of this\r\ndisorganization of his physical system.\r\n\r\nDreams are symbols used by subjectivity to impress the objective\r\nor material mind with a sense of coming good or evil.  Subjectivity is\r\nthe spiritual part of man.  The soul is that circle of man lying\r\njust outside the gross materiality and partaking largely of it.\r\nAll thoughts and desires enter first the soul or material mind\r\nand then cast themselves on the spirit.  Frequently the soul becomes\r\nso filled with material or present ideas, that the spiritual symbols\r\nare crowded out, and then it is that dreams seen to be contrary.\r\nMaterial subjectivity, that is, all thoughts and ideas emanating\r\nfrom material sources, go to make up this circle; then the mind\r\ncatches up the better thoughts of this section and weaves them\r\ninto a broader and more comprehensive power, sustaining the owner\r\nin his own judgment.\r\n\r\nAnd still another circle is formed of the finer compound of this,\r\nwhich is spiritual subjectivity, or the highest element of intelligence\r\nreached by man.  [This circle is ``the spiritual man'' and relates\r\nin substance to the spiritual soul of the macrocosm or universe.\r\nIt becomes strong or weak as we recognize or fail to recognize\r\nit as a factor of being.  The process of spiritual development\r\nis similar to that of the vegetable and animal kingdoms.\r\nThe trees on the outer rim of the forest are more capable of resisting\r\nthe wind than those more to the center, by reason of their exposure\r\nto storms; the roots have penetrated with double strength far\r\ninto the earth, and the branches are braced with toughened bark\r\nand closely knitted ligaments.\r\n\r\nThe same may be said of the animal kingdom.  The mind is developed\r\nby vigorous exercise just as are likewise the muscles of the body.\r\nThe more these are cultivated by drawing from their parental affinities\r\nin the macrocosm, the more knowledge or power they take on.\r\nThus as a man simulates in thought and action an ape, a tiger, a goat,\r\na snake or a lamb he takes on their characteristics and is swayed by\r\nlike influences to enmity, meekness, covetousness and avariciousness.\r\nTo illustrate further.  If he is cunning he draws on the fox of\r\nthe microcosm and becomes, in action and thought, like that animal.\r\nIf selfishness survives, the hog principle is aroused from its latent\r\ncells in the microcosm and he is dominated by material appetites.\r\nIn a similar way he may perceive the spiritual in himself.\r\nNature's laws, with all their numberless and intricate ramifications\r\nare simple in their harmony of process and uniformity of purpose\r\nwhen applied to the physical and ethical developments of man.]\r\n\r\nPossibilities for inner improvements or expansions rest with material man.\r\nIf he entertains gross desires to the exclusion of spiritual germs,\r\nhe will dwarf and degrade higher aspirations, and thus deprive subjective\r\nspirituality of her rightful possessions.\r\n\r\n* * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nNature, in compounding the materials for the creation of the deaf man,\r\ninadvertently dropped the ingredient sound, hence making an imperfect being;\r\nand sound, being thus foreign to his nature, he can only be approached\r\nby signs even in dreams.  Subjectivity uses nature's forces,\r\nwhile a normal person uses dreams to work on his waking consciousness.\r\nAs it is impossible to use with effect a factor which a man does not\r\nnaturally possess, a deaf man rarely ever dreams of sound, or a blind\r\nman of light.\r\n\r\n* * * *\r\n\r\nTWO DREAMS ARE NEVER THE SAME, NOR ARE TWO FLOWERS EVER ALIKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever symbol is used to impress the dreamer is the one\r\nwhich is likely to warn him more definitely than any other.\r\nNo two persons being ever in the same state at the same time,\r\nthe same symbols would hardly convey identical impressions;\r\nneither will the same dream be as effective in all cases\r\nof business or love with the same dreamer.\r\n\r\nA person's dream perception wavers, much as it does in waking hours.\r\nYou fail to find the same fragrance in the rose at all times,\r\nthough the same influences seemingly surround you; and thus it is\r\nthat different dreams must be used for different persons to convey\r\nthe same meaning.\r\n\r\nCreation, confident of her power to perfect her designs,\r\ndoes not resort to that monotony in her work, which might result\r\nwere the perception of man, or the petals and fragrance of flowers\r\ncast from one stereotyped mold of intelligence, beauty or sweetness.\r\nThis variety of scheme runs through all creation.\r\nYou think you have identical dreams, but there is always\r\nsome variation, even if it be something dreamed immediately over.\r\nNature is no sluggard and is forever changing her compounds,\r\nso that there is bound to be change in the details even of dreams.\r\nThis change would not materially affect the approach of happiness\r\nor sorrow in different people, and hence the same dreams are\r\nreliable for all.\r\n\r\nPersons of the same or similar temperament will be more deeply\r\nimpressed by a certain dream than would people their opposite;\r\nand though the dream cannot be the same in detail yet it is\r\napparently the same, just as two like flowers are called roses,\r\nthough they are not identical.\r\n\r\nIf a young woman twenty-five and a girl of fifteen should each have a dream\r\nof marriage, the same definition would apply to each, just the same\r\nas if they would each approach a flower and smell of it differently.\r\nDifferent influences will possess them unconsciously, though the outward\r\nappearance be the same.\r\n\r\nA young woman of a certain age is warned in a dream of trouble\r\nlikely to befall her, while another of similar age and\r\nthreatened trouble is warned also, but in different symbols,\r\nwhich she fails to grasp and bring back to waking existence,\r\nand she thus believes she has had no warning dream.\r\n\r\nThere are those in the world who lack subjective strength,\r\nmaterial or spiritual, and hence they fail to receive dreams,\r\nhowever symbolic, because there is no power within them\r\nto retain these impressions.\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons for this loss, utter material gross-ness, want\r\nof memory, physical weakness uncoupled from extreme nervousness,\r\nand total lack of faith in any warning or revelation purporting\r\nor coming from the dream consciousness.\r\n\r\nTo dream at night and the following day have the thing dreamed of\r\nactually take place, or come before your notice, is not allegorical.\r\nIt is the higher or spiritual sense living or grasping the immediate\r\nfuture ahead of the physical mind.  The spiritual body is\r\nalways first to come into contact with the approaching future;\r\nit is present with it, while still future to the physical body.\r\nThere is no reason why man should not grasp coming events earlier,\r\nonly he does not cultivate inner sight as he does his outer senses.\r\nThe allegorical is used because man weakens his spiritual force\r\nby catering to the material senses.\r\n\r\nHe clings to the pleasures and woes of the material world\r\nto the exclusion of spirituality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT'S IN A DREAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\n\r\n``_When he was set down on the Judgment seat, his wife sent\r\nunto him, saying, `Have thou nothing to do with that just man;\r\nfor I have suffered many things this day in a dream, because of him_.'\r\n''--Matthew xxvii, 19.\r\n\r\n_Abandon_.\r\n\r\nTo dream that you are abandoned, denotes that you will have difficulty\r\nin framing your plans for future success.\r\n\r\nTo abandon others, you will see unhappy conditions piled thick around you,\r\nleaving little hope of surmounting them.\r\n\r\nIf it is your house that you abandon, you will soon come to grief\r\nin experimenting with fortune.\r\n\r\nIf you abandon your sweetheart, you will fail to recover lost valuables,\r\nand friends will turn aside from your favors.\r\n\r\nIf you abandon a mistress, you will unexpectedly come into\r\na goodly inheritance.\r\n\r\nIf it is religion you abandon, you will come to grief by your attacks\r\non prominent people.\r\n\r\nTo abandon children, denotes that you will lose your fortune\r\nby lack of calmness and judgment.\r\n\r\nTo abandon your business, indicates distressing circumstances in which there\r\nwill be quarrels and suspicion.  (This dream may have a literal fulfilment\r\nif it is impressed on your waking mind, whether you abandon a person,\r\nor that person abandons you, or, as indicated, it denotes other worries.)\r\n\r\nTo see yourself or friend abandon a ship, suggests your possible\r\nentanglement in some business failure, but if you escape to shore\r\nyour interests will remain secure.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Abbey_.[3]\r\n\r\nTo see an abbey in ruins, foretells that your hopes and schemes\r\nwill fall into ignoble incompletion.\r\n\r\nTo dream that a priest bars your entrance into an abbey,\r\ndenotes that you will be saved from a ruinous state by enemies\r\nmistaking your embarrassment for progress.\r\n\r\nFor a young woman to get into an abbey, foretells her violent illness.\r\nIf she converses with a priest in an abbey, she will incur the censure\r\nof true friends for indiscretion.\r\n\r\n_Abbess_.\r\n\r\nFor a young woman to dream that she sees an abbess, denotes that she\r\nwill be compelled to perform distasteful tasks, and will submit\r\nto authority only after unsuccessful rebellion.\r\n\r\nTo dream of an abbess smiling and benignant, denotes you will be surrounded\r\nby true friends and pleasing prospects.\r\n\r\n_Abbot_.[3]\r\n\r\nTo dream that you are an abbot, warns you that treacherous plots\r\nare being laid for your downfall.\r\n\r\nIf you see this pious man in devotional exercises, it forewarns\r\nyou of smooth flattery and deceit pulling you a willing victim\r\ninto the meshes of artful bewilderment.\r\n\r\nFor a young woman to talk with an abbot, portends that she will yield to\r\ninsinuating flatteries, and in yielding she will besmirch her reputation.\r\nIf she marries one, she will uphold her name and honor despite\r\npoverty and temptation.\r\n\r\n[3] See similar words in connection with churches, priests, etc.\r\n\r\n_Abdomen_.[4]\r\n\r\nTo see your abdomen in a dream, foretells that you will have\r\ngreat expectations, but you must curb hardheadedness and redouble\r\nyour energies on your labor, as pleasure is approaching to your hurt.\r\n\r\nTo see your abdomen shriveled, foretells that you will be persecuted\r\nand defied by false friends.\r\n\r\nTo see it swollen, you will have tribulations, but you will overcome them\r\nand enjoy the fruits of your labor.\r\n\r\nTo see blood oozing from the abdomen, foretells an accident or tragedy\r\nin your family.\r\n\r\nThe abdomen of children in an unhealthy state, portends that contagion\r\nwill pursue you.\r\n\r\n[4] See Belly.\r\n\r\n_Abhor_.\r\n\r\nTo dream that you abhor a person, denotes that you will entertain\r\nstrange dislike for some person, and your suspicion of his honesty\r\nwill prove correct.\r\n\r\nTo think yourself held in abhorrence by others, predicts that your good\r\nintentions to others will subside into selfishness.\r\n\r\nFor a young woman to dream that her lover abhors her, foretells that she\r\nwill love a man who is in no sense congenial.\r\n\r\n_Abject_.\r\n\r\nTo dream that you are abject, denotes that you will be the recipient\r\nof gloomy tidings, which will cause a relaxation in your strenuous\r\nefforts to climb the heights of prosperity.\r\n\r\nTo see others abject, is a sign of bickerings and false dealings\r\namong your friends.\r\n\r\n_Abode_.[5]\r\n\r\nTo dream that you can't find your abode, you will completely lose\r\nfaith in the integrity of others.\r\n\r\nIf you have no abode in your dreams, you will be unfortunate in your affairs,\r\nand lose by speculation.\r\n\r\nTo change your abode, signifies hurried tidings and that hasty journeys\r\nwill be made by you.\r\n\r\nFor a young woman to dream that she has left her abode, is significant\r\nof slander and falsehoods being perpetrated against her.\r\n\r\n[5] See Home.\r\n\r\n_Abortion_.\r\n\r\nFor a woman to dream that she assents to abortion being committed on her,\r\nis a warning that she is contemplating some enterprise which if carried\r\nout will steep her in disgrace and unhappiness.\r\n\r\nFor a doctor to dream that he is a party to an abortion,\r\nforetells that his practice will suffer from his inattention\r\nto duty, which will cause much trouble.\r\n\r\n_Above_.\r\n\r\nTo see anything hanging above you, and about to fall, implies danger;\r\nif it falls upon you it may be ruin or sudden disappointment.\r\nIf it falls near, but misses you, it is a sign that you will have\r\na narrow escape from loss of money, or other misfortunes may follow.\r\n\r\nShould it be securely fixed above you, so as not to imply danger,\r\nyour condition will improve after threatened loss.\r\n\r\n_Abroad_.\r\n\r\nTo dream that you are abroad, or going abroad, foretells that you\r\nwill soon, in company with a party, make a pleasant trip, and you\r\nwill find it necessary to absent yourself from your native country\r\nfor a sojourn in a different climate.\r\n\r\n_Absalom_.\r\n\r\nTo dream of Absalom, is significant of distressing incidents.\r\nYou may unconsciously fall a victim to error, and penetrate\r\nsome well beloved heart with keen anguish and pain over the\r\ncommittal of immoral actions and the outraging of innocence.\r\nNo flower of purity will ever be too sacred for you to breathe\r\na passionate breath upon.  To dream of this, or any other\r\ndisobedient character, is a warning against immoral tendencies.\r\nA father is warned by this dream to be careful of his children.\r\n\r\n_Absence_.\r\n\r\nTo grieve over the absence of any one in your dreams, denotes that repentance\r\nfor some hasty action will be the means of securing you life-long friendships.\r\n\r\nIf you rejoice over the absence of friends, it denotes that you\r\nwill soon be well rid of an enemy.\r\n\r\n_Abscess_.\r\n\r\nTo dream that you have an abscess which seems to have reached a chronic stage,\r\nyou will be overwhelmed with misfortune of your own; at the same time your\r\ndeepest sympathies will be enlisted for the sorrows of others.\r\n\r\n_Absinthe_.\r\n\r\nTo come under the influence of absinthe in dreams, denotes that you\r\nwill lead a merry and foolish pace with innocent companions, and waste\r\nyour inheritance in prodigal lavishness on the siren, selfish fancy.\r\n\r\nFor a young woman to dream that she drinks absinthe with her lover warns\r\nher to resist his persuasions to illicit consummation of their love.

There are two forces at work in man, one from\r\nwithin and the other from without.  They are from two distinct spheres;\r\nthe animal mind influenced by the personal world of carnal appetites,\r\nand the spiritual mind from the realm of universal Brotherhood,\r\npresent antagonistic motives on the dream consciousness.  If these two\r\nforces were in harmony, the spirit or mental picture from the dream\r\nmind would find a literal fulfilment in the life of the dreamer.\r\nThe pleasurable sensations of the body cause the spirit anguish.\r\nThe selfish enrichment of the body impoverishes the spirit influence upon\r\nthe Soul.  The trials of adversity often cause the spirit to rejoice\r\nand the flesh to weep.

If it is her lover she sees aged,\r\nshe will be in danger of losing him.\r\n\r\n_Agony_.[15]\r\n\r\nThis is not as good a dream, as some would wish you to believe.\r\nIt portends worry and pleasure intermingled, more of the former\r\nthan of the latter.\r\n\r\nTo be in agony over the loss of money, or property, denotes that disturbing\r\nand imaginary fears will rack you over the critical condition of affairs,\r\nor the illness of some dear relative.\r\n\r\n[15] See Weeping.\r\n\r\n_Ague_.\r\n\r\nA sickly condition of the dreamer is sometimes implied by this dream.\r\nTo dream that you are shaking with an ague, signifies that you will suffer\r\nfrom some physical disorder, and that fluctuating opinions of your own\r\naffairs may bring you to the borders of prostration.\r\n\r\nTo see others thus affected, denotes that you will offend people\r\nby your supreme indifference to the influences of others.\r\n\r\n_Air_.\r\n\r\nThis dream denotes a withering state of things, and bodes no good\r\nto the dreamer.\r\n\r\nTo dream of breathing hot air suggests that you will be influenced\r\nto evil by oppression.\r\n\r\nTo feel cold air, denotes discrepancies in your business,\r\nand incompatibility in domestic relations.\r\n\r\nTo feel oppressed with humidity, some curse will fall on you\r\nthat will prostrate and close down on your optimistical views\r\nof the future.\r\n\r\n_Alabaster_.\r\n\r\nTo dream of alabaster, foretells success in marriage and all\r\nlegitimate affairs.

Some people that were\r\nsick have been informed during their sleep what remedies they should use,\r\nand after using the remedies, they became cured, and such things have\r\nhappened not only to Christians, but also to Jews, Persians, and heathens,\r\nto good and to bad persons.''\r\n\r\nThe writer does not hold that such knowledge is obtained from external\r\nor excarnate spirits, but rather through the personal _Spirit Glimpses_\r\nthat is in man.--AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Death_.[53]\r\n\r\nTo dream of seeing any of your people dead, warns you of coming dissolution\r\nor sorrow.  Disappointments always follow dreams of this nature.\r\n\r\nTo hear of any friend or relative being dead, you will soon have bad news\r\nfrom some of them.\r\n\r\nDreams relating to death or dying, unless they are due\r\nto spiritual causes, are misleading and very confusing to\r\nthe novice in dream lore when he attempts to interpret them.\r\nA man who thinks intensely fills his aura with thought or\r\nsubjective images active with the passions that gave them birth;\r\nby thinking and acting on other lines, he may supplant these\r\nimages with others possessed of a different form and nature.\r\nIn his dreams he may see these images dying, dead or\r\ntheir burial, and mistake them for friends or enemies.\r\nIn this way he may, while asleep, see himself or a relative die,\r\nwhen in reality he has been warned that some good thought\r\nor deed is to be supplanted by an evil one.  To illustrate:\r\nIf it is a dear friend or relative whom he sees in the agony\r\nof death, he is warned against immoral or other improper thought\r\nand action, but if it is an enemy or some repulsive object\r\ndismantled in death, he may overcome his evil ways and thus give\r\nhimself or friends cause for joy.  Often the end or beginning\r\nof suspense or trials are foretold by dreams of this nature.\r\nThey also frequently occur when the dreamer is controlled by imaginary\r\nstates of evil or good.  A man in that state is not himself,\r\nbut is what the dominating influences make him.  He may be warned\r\nof approaching conditions or his extrication from the same.\r\nIn our dreams we are closer to our real self than in waking life.\r\nThe hideous or pleasing incidents seen and heard about us in our\r\ndreams are all of our own making, they reflect the true state\r\nof our soul and body, and we cannot flee from them unless we drive\r\nthem out of our being by the use of good thoughts and deeds,\r\nby the power of the spirit within us.\r\n\r\n[53] See Corpse.\r\n\r\n_Debt_.\r\n\r\nDebt is rather a bad dream, foretelling worries in business and love,\r\nand struggles for a competency; but if you have plenty to meet all\r\nyour obligations, your affairs will assume a favorable turn.\r\n\r\n_December_.\r\n\r\nTo dream of December, foretells accumulation of wealth, but loss\r\nof friendship.
