Still.]\r\n\r\n   Philosophy of Osteopathy;\r\n\r\n   BY\r\n\r\n   ANDREW T. STILL,\r\n\r\n\r\n   DISCOVERER OF THE SCIENCE OF OSTEOPATHY AND\r\n   PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN SCHOOL\r\n   OF OSTEOPATHY.\r\n\r\n\r\n   PUBLISHED BY\r\n   A. T. STILL, KIRKSVILLE, MO\r\n   1899.\r\n\r\n   Copyrighted, 1899, by\r\n   A. T. STILL.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Lithoprinted by\r\n   EDWARD BROTHERS, INC.\r\n   Ann Arbor, Michigan, U.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of my friends have been anxious ever since Osteopathy became an\r\nestablished fact, that I should write a treatise on the science. But I\r\nwas never convinced that the time was ripe for such a production, nor am\r\nI even now convinced that this is not a little premature. Osteopathy is\r\nonly in its infancy, it is a great unknown sea just discovered, and as\r\nyet we are only acquainted with its shore-tide.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw others who had not more than skimmed the surface of the\r\nscience, taking up the pen to write books on Osteopathy, and after\r\nhaving carefully examined their productions, found they were drinking\r\nfrom the fountains of old schools of drugs, dragging back the science to\r\nthe very systems from which I divorced myself so many years ago, and\r\nrealized that hungry students were ready to swallow such mental poison,\r\ndangerous as it was, I became fully awakened to the necessity of some\r\nsort of Osteopathic literature for those wishing to be informed.\r\n\r\nThis book is free from quotations from medical authors, and differs\r\nfrom them in opinion on almost every important question. I do not expect\r\nit to meet their approval; such a thing would be unnatural and\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nIt is my object in this work to teach principles as I understand them,\r\nand not rules. I do not instruct the student to punch or pull a certain\r\nbone, nerve or muscle for a certain disease, but by a knowledge of the\r\nnormal and abnormal, I hope to give a specific knowledge for all\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nThis work has been written a little at a time for several years, just as\r\nI could snatch a moment from other cares to devote to it. I have\r\ncarefully compiled these thoughts into a treatise. Every principle\r\nherein laid down has been fairly well tested by myself, and proven true.\r\n\r\nThe book has been written by myself in my own way, without any ambition\r\nto fine writing, but to give to the world a start in a philosophy that\r\nmay be a guide in the future.\r\n\r\nOwing to the great haste with which the book has been rushed through the\r\npress to meet the urgent demand, we will ask the indulgence of the\r\npublic for any imperfection that may appear. Hoping the world may profit\r\nby these thoughts, I am,\r\n\r\n   Respectfully,\r\n   A. T. STILL.\r\n\r\n   Kirksville, Mo., Sept. 1, 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nSOME INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.\r\n\r\nNot a Work of Compilation--Authors Quoted--Method of Reasoning--The\r\nOsteopath an Artist--When I Became an Osteopath--Dr. Neal's Opinion--The\r\nOpinions of Others--What Studies Necessary--What I Mean by\r\nAnatomy--Principles--The Practicing Osteopath's Guide--The Fascia--Not a\r\npleasing Task--Without Accepted Theories--Truths of Nature--Body, Motion\r\nand Mind--Osteopathy to Cure Disease--The Osteopath Should Find\r\nHealth.

As I have spent thirty years of my life reading and\r\nfollowing rules and remedies used for curing, and learned in sorrow it\r\nwas useless to listen to their claims, for instead of getting good, I\r\nobtained much harm therefrom, I asked for, and obtained a mental divorce\r\nfrom them, and I want it to be understood that drugs and I are as far\r\napart as the East is from the West; now, and forever. Henceforth I will\r\nfollow the dictates of nature in all I say or write.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHORS QUOTED.\r\n\r\nI quote no authors but God and experience when I write, or lecture to\r\nthe classes or the masses, because no book written by medical writers\r\ncan be of much use to us, and it would be very foolish to look to them\r\nfor advice and instruction on a science they know nothing of. They are\r\nilly able to advise for themselves, they have never been asked to advise\r\nus, and I am free to say but few persons who have been pupils of my\r\nschool have tried to get wisdom from medical writers and apply it as\r\nworthy to be taught as any part of Osteopathy, philosophy or practice.\r\nSeveral books have been compiled, called \"Principles of Osteopathy.\"\r\nThey may sell but will fail to give the knowledge the student desires.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF REASONING.\r\n\r\nThe student of any philosophy succeeds best by the more simple methods\r\nof reasoning. We reason for needed knowledge only, and should try and\r\nstart out with as many known facts as possible. If we would reason on\r\ndiseases of the organs of the head, neck, abdomen or pelvis, we must\r\nfirst know where these organs are, how and from what arteries the eye,\r\near, or tongue is fed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OSTEOPATH AN ARTIST.\r\n\r\nI believe you are taught anatomy in our school more thoroughly than any\r\nother school to date, because we want you to carry a living picture of\r\nall or any part of the body in your mind as a ready painter carries the\r\npicture of the face, scenery, beast or any thing he wishes to represent\r\nby his brush. He would only be a waster of time and paint and make a\r\ndaub that would disgust any one who would employ him. We teach you\r\nanatomy in all its branches, that you may be able to have and keep a\r\nliving picture before your mind all the time, so you can see all joints,\r\nligaments, muscles, glands, arteries, veins, lymphatics, fascia\r\nsuperficial and deep, all organs, how they are fed, what they must do,\r\nand why they are expected to do a part, and what would follow in case\r\nthat part was not done well and on time. I feel free to say to my\r\nstudents, keep your minds full of pictures of the normal body all the\r\ntime, while treating the afflicted.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN I BECAME AN OSTEOPATH.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the questions of how long have you been teaching this\r\ndiscovery, and what books are essential to the study? I will say I began\r\nto give reasons for my faith in the laws of life as given to men, worlds\r\nand beings by the God of nature, June, 1874, when I began to talk and\r\npropound questions to men of learning. I thought the sword and cannons\r\nof nature were pointed and trained upon our systems of drug doctoring.\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. NEAL'S OPINION.\r\n\r\nI asked Dr. J. M. Neal, of Edinburg, Scotland, for some information that\r\nI needed badly. He was a medical doctor of five years training, a man of\r\nmuch mental ability, who would give his opinions freely and to the\r\npoint. I have been told by one or more Scotch M. D.'s that a Dr. John M.\r\nNeal, of Edinburg, was hung for murder. He was not hung while with me.\r\nThe only thing made me doubt him being a Scotchman was he loved whiskey,\r\nand I had been told that the Scotch were a sensible people. John M. Neal\r\nsaid that \"drugs was the bait of fools\"; it was no science, and the\r\nsystem of drugs was only a trade, followed by the doctor for the money\r\nthat could be obtained by it from the ignorant sick. He believed that\r\nnature was a law capable of vindicating its power all over the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OPINIONS OF OTHERS.\r\n\r\nAs this writing is for the information of the student I will continue\r\nthe history by saying, that in the early days of Osteopathy I sought the\r\nopinions of the most learned, such as Dr. Schnebly, Professor of\r\nLanguage and History in the Baker University, Baldwin, Kansas; Dr.\r\nDallas, a very learned M. D. of the Alopathic faith; Dr. F. A. Grove,\r\nwell-known in Kirksville; J. B. Abbott, Indian agent, and many others of\r\nrenown. Then back to the tombs of the dead, to better acquaint myself\r\nwith the systems of medicine and the foundations of truth upon which\r\nthey stood, if any. I will not worry your patience with a list of the\r\nnames of authors that have written upon the subject of medicine, as\r\nremedial agents. I will use the word that the theologian often uses when\r\nasked whom Christ died for, the answer universally is, ALL. All\r\nintelligent medical writers say by word or inference that drugs or\r\ndrugging is a system of blind guess work, and if we should let our\r\nopinions be governed by the marble lambs and other emblems of dead\r\nbabies found in the cemeteries of the world, we would say that John M.\r\nNeal was possibly hung for murder, not through design, but through\r\ntraditional ignorance of the power of nature to cure both old and young,\r\nby skillfully adjusting the engines of life so as to bring forth pure\r\nand healthy blood, the greatest known germicide, to one capable to\r\nreason who has the skill to conduct the vitalizing and protecting fluids\r\nto throat, lungs and all parts of the system, and ward off diseases as\r\nnature's God has indicated. With this faith and method of reasoning, I\r\nbegan to treat diseases by Osteopathy as an experimenter, and\r\nnotwithstanding I obtained good results in all cases in diseases of\r\nclimate and contagions, I hesitated for years to proclaim to the world\r\nthat there was but little excuse for a master engineer to lose a child\r\nin cases of diphtheria, croup, measles, mumps, whooping cough, flux and\r\nother forms of summer diseases, peculiar to children. Neither was it\r\nnecessary for the adult to die with diseases of summer, fall and winter.\r\nBut at last I took my stand on this rock and my confidence in nature,\r\nwhere I have stood and fought the battles, and taken the enemy's flag in\r\nevery engagement for the last twenty-five years.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT STUDIES NECESSARY.\r\n\r\nAs you contemplate studying this science and have asked to know the\r\nnecessary studies, I wish to impress it upon your minds that you begin\r\nwith anatomy, and you end with anatomy, a knowledge of anatomy is all\r\nyou want or need, as it is all you can use or ever will use in your\r\npractice, although you may live one hundred years. You have asked for my\r\nopinion as the founder of the science. Yours is an honest question, and\r\nGod being my judge I will give you just as honest an answer. As I have\r\nsaid, a knowledge of anatomy with its application covers every inch of\r\nground that is necessary to qualify you to become a skillful and\r\nsuccessful Osteopath, when you go forth into the world to combat\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT I MEAN BY ANATOMY.\r\n\r\nI will now define what I mean by anatomy. I speak by comparison and\r\ntell you what belongs to the study of anatomy. I will take a chicken\r\nwhose parts and habits all persons are familiar with to illustrate. The\r\nchicken has a head, a neck, a breast, a tail, two legs, two wings, two\r\neyes, two ears, two feet, one gizzard, one crop, one set of bowels, one\r\nliver, and one heart. This chicken has a nervous system, a glandular\r\nsystem, a muscular system, a system of lungs and other parts and\r\nprinciples not necessary to speak of in detail. But I want to emphasize,\r\nthey belong to the chicken, and it would not be a chicken without every\r\npart or principle. These must all be present and answer roll call or we\r\ndo not have a complete chicken. Now I will try and give you the parts of\r\nanatomy and the books that pertain to the same. You want some standard\r\nauthor on descriptive anatomy in which you learn the form and places of\r\nall bones, the place and uses of ligaments, muscles and all that belong\r\nto the soft parts. Then from the descriptive anatomy you are conducted\r\ninto the dissecting room, in which you receive demonstrations, and are\r\nshown all parts through which blood and other fluids are conducted. So\r\nfar you see you are in anatomy. From the demonstrator you are conducted\r\nto another room or branch of anatomy called physiology, a knowledge of\r\nwhich no Osteopath can do without and be a success. In that room you are\r\ntaught how the blood and other fluids of life are produced, and the\r\nchannels through which this fluid is conducted to the heart and lungs\r\nfor purity and other qualifying processes, previous to entering the\r\nheart for general circulation to nourish and sustain the whole human\r\nbody. I want to insist and impress it upon your minds that this is as\r\nmuch a part of anatomy as a wing is a part of a chicken. From this room\r\nof anatomy you are conducted to the room of histology, in which the eye\r\nis aided by powerful microscopes and made acquainted with the smallest\r\narteries of the human body, which in life are of the greatest known\r\nimportance, remembering that in the room of histology you are still\r\nstudying anatomy, and what that machinery can and does execute every\r\nday, hour, and minute of life. From the histological room you are\r\nconducted to the room of elementary chemistry, in which you learn\r\nsomething of the laws of association of substances, that you can the\r\nbetter understand what has been told you in the physiological room,\r\nwhich is only a branch of anatomy, and intended to show you that nature\r\ncan and does successfully compound and combine elements for muscles,\r\nblood, teeth and bone. From there you are taken to the room of the\r\nclinics, where you are first made acquainted with both the normal and\r\nabnormal human body, which is only a continuation of the study of\r\nanatomy. From there you are taken to the engineer's room (or operator's\r\nroom) in which you are taught how to observe and detect abnormalities\r\nand the effect or effects they may and do produce, and how they effect\r\nhealth and cause that condition known as disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPLES.\r\n\r\nPrinciples to an Osteopath means a perfect plan and specification to\r\nbuild in form a house, an engine, a man, a world, or anything for an\r\nobject or purpose. To comprehend this engine of life or man which is so\r\nconstructed with all conveniences for which it was made, it is necessary\r\nto constantly keep the plan and specification before the mind, and in\r\nthe mind, to such a degree that there is no lack of knowledge of the\r\nbearings and uses of all parts. After a complete knowledge of all parts\r\nwith their forms, sizes and places of attachment which should be so\r\nthoroughly grounded in the memory that there would be no doubt of the\r\nintent of the builder for the use or purpose of the great and small\r\nparts, and why they have a part to perform in the workings of the\r\nengine. When this part of the specification is thoroughly learned from\r\nanatomy or the engineer's guide book, he will then take up the chapter\r\non the division of forces, by which this engine moves and performs the\r\nduties for which it was created. In this chapter the mind will be\r\nreferred to the brain to obtain a knowledge of that organ, where the\r\nforce starts, how it is conducted to any belt, pully, journal, or\r\ndivision of the whole building. After learning where the force is\r\nobtained, and how conveyed from place to place throughout the whole\r\nbody, he becomes interested and wisely instructed. He sees the various\r\nparts of this great system of life when preparing fluids commonly known\r\nas blood, passing through a set of tubes both great and small--some so\r\nvastly small, as to require the aid of powerful microscopes to see their\r\ninfinitely small forms, through which the blood and other fluids are\r\nconducted by the heart and force of the brain, to construct organs,\r\nmuscles, membranes and all the things necessary to life and motion, to\r\nthe parts separately and combined. By this minute acquaintance with the\r\nnormal body which has been learned in the specification as written in\r\nstandard authors of anatomy and the dissecting rooms, he is well\r\nprepared to be invited into the inspection room to receive comparisons\r\nbetween the normal and abnormal engines, built according to nature's\r\nplan and specification, and absolutely perfect. He is called into this\r\nroom for the purpose of comparing engines that have been strained from\r\nbeing thrown off the track, or run against other bodies with such force\r\nas to bend journals, pipes, break or loosen bolts; or otherwise\r\nderanged, so as to render it useless until repaired. To repair signifies\r\nto readjust from the abnormal condition in which the machinist finds it,\r\nto the condition of the normal engines which stand in the shop of\r\nrepairs. His inspection would commence by first lining up the wheels\r\nwith straight journals; then he would naturally be conducted to the\r\nboiler, steam chest, shafts, and every part that belongs to a completed\r\nengine. To know that they are straight and in place as shown upon the\r\nplan and described by the specification, he has done all that is\r\nrequired of a master mechanic. Then it goes into the hands of the\r\nengineer, who waters, fires and conducts this artificial being on its\r\njourney. You as Osteopathic machinists can go no farther than to adjust\r\nthe abnormal condition, in which you find the afflicted. Nature will do\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRACTICING OSTEOPATH'S GUIDE.\r\n\r\nThe Osteopath reasons if he reasons at all, that order and health are\r\ninseparable, and that when order in all parts is found, disease cannot\r\nprevail, and if order is complete and disease should be found, there is\r\nno use for order. And if order and health are universally one in union,\r\nthen the doctor cannot usefully, physiologically, or philosophically be\r\nguided by any scale of reason, otherwise. Does a chemist get results\r\ndesired by accident? Are your accidents more likely to get good results\r\nthan his? Does order and success demand thought and cool headed reason?\r\nIf we wish to be governed by reason, we must take a position that is\r\nfounded on truth and capable of presenting facts, to prove the validity\r\nof all truths we present. A truth is only a hopeful supposition if it is\r\nnot supported by results. Thus all nature is kind enough to willingly\r\nexhibit specimens of its work as vindicating witnesses of its ability to\r\nprove its assertions by its work. Without that tangible proof, nature\r\nwould belong to the gods of chance. The laws of mother, conception,\r\ngrowth and birth, from atoms to worlds would be a failure, a universe\r\nwithout a head to direct. But as the beautiful works of nature stand\r\nto-day, and in all time past, fully able by the evidence it holds before\r\nthe eye and mind of reason, that all beings great and small came by the\r\nlaw of cause and effect, are we not bound to work by the laws of cause,\r\nif we wish an effect? If the heavens do move by cause when was its\r\nbeings divorced from that great common law? Are we not bound to trust\r\nand work by the old and reliable self-evident laws, until something\r\nlater has proven its superior ability to ward off disease and cure the\r\nsick.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FASCIA.\r\n\r\nI know of no part of the body that equals the fascia as a hunting\r\nground. I believe that more rich golden thought will appear to the\r\nmind's eye as the study of the fascia is pursued than any division of\r\nthe body. Still one part is just as great and useful as any other in its\r\nplace. No part can be dispensed with. But the fascia is the ground in\r\nwhich all causes of death do the destruction of life. Every view we\r\ntake, a wonder appears. Here we find a place for the white corpuscles\r\nbuilding anew and giving strength to throw impurities from the body by\r\ntubes that run from the skin to tanks of useful fluids, that would heap\r\nup and are no longer of use in the body. No doubt nerves exist in the\r\nfascia, that change the fluid to gas, and force it through the spongy\r\nand porous system as a delivery by the vital chain of wonders, that go\r\non all the time to keep nerves wholly pure.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOT A PLEASANT TASK.\r\n\r\nI dislike to write, and only do so, when I think my productions will go\r\ninto the hands of kind-hearted geniuses who read, not to find a book of\r\nquotations, but to go with the soul of the subject that is being\r\nexplored for its merits,--weigh all truths and help bring its uses front\r\nfor the good of man.\r\n\r\nOsteopathy has not asked a place in written literature prior to this\r\ndate, and does not hope to appear on written pages even to suit the\r\nauthor of this imperfectly written book.\r\n\r\n\r\nWITHOUT ACCEPTED THEORIES.\r\n\r\nColumbus had to launch and navigate much and long, and meet many storms,\r\nbecause he had not the written experience of other travelers to guide\r\nhim. He had only a few bits of drift-wood not common to his home growth,\r\nto cause him to move as he did. But there was a fact, a bit of wood that\r\ndid not grow on his home soil.\r\n\r\nHe reasoned that it must be from some land amid the sea whose shores had\r\nnot before been known to his race. With these facts and his powerful\r\nmind of reason, he met all opposition, and moved alone; just as all men\r\ndo who have no use for theories as their compass to guide them through\r\nthe storms. This opposition a mental explorer must meet.\r\n\r\nI felt that I must anchor my boat to living truths and follow them\r\nwheresoever they might drift. Thus I launched my boat many years ago on\r\nthe open seas, fearlessly, and have never found a wave of scorn nor\r\nabuse that truth could not eat, and do well on.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRUTHS OF NATURE.\r\n\r\nWe often speak of truth. We say great truths, and use many other\r\nqualifying expressions. But no one truth is greater than any other\r\ntruth. Each has a sphere of usefulness peculiar to itself. Thus we\r\nshould treat with respect and reverence all truths, great and small. A\r\ntruth is the complete work of nature, which can only be demonstrated by\r\nthe vital principle belonging to that class of truths. Each truth or\r\ndivision as we see it, can only be made known to us by the self evident\r\nfact, which this truth is able to demonstrate by its action.\r\n\r\nIf we take man as our object to base the beginning of our reason, we\r\nfind the association of many elements, which differ in kind to suit the\r\npurpose for which they were designed. To us they act, to us they are\r\nwisely formed and located for the purpose for which they were designed.\r\nThrough our five senses we deal with the material body. It has action.\r\nThat we observe by vision which connects the mind to reason. High above\r\nthe five senses on the subject of cause or causes of this, is motion. By\r\nthe testimony of the witness the mind is connected in a manner by which\r\nit can reason on solidity and size. By smell, taste and sound, we make\r\nother connections between the chambers of reason and the object we\r\ndesire to reason upon; and thus our foundation on which all five\r\nwitnesses are arrayed to the superior principle which is mind.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing a human being complete in form, self moving, with power to\r\nstop or go on at will, to us he seems to obey some commander. He seems\r\nto go so far and stop; he lies down and gets up; he turns round and\r\nfaces the objects that are traveling in the same direction he does.\r\nPossibly he faces the object by his own action. Then by about facing, he\r\nsees one coming with greater velocity, sees he can not escape by his own\r\nspeed, so he steps aside and lets that body pass on, as though he moved\r\nin obedience to some order. The bystander would ask the question, \"How\r\ndid he know such a dangerous body was approaching?\" He finds on the most\r\ncrucial examination, that the sense of hearing is wholly without reason.\r\nThe same is true with all the five senses pertaining to man, beast, or\r\nbird. This being the condition of the five physical senses, we are\r\nforced by reason to conclude there is a superior being who conducts the\r\nmaterial man, sustains, supports and guards against danger; and after\r\nall our explorations, we have to decide that man is triune when\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\n\r\nBODY, MOTION AND MIND.\r\n\r\nFirst the material body, second the spiritual being, third a being of\r\nmind which is far superior to all vital motions and material forms,\r\nwhose duty is to wisely manage this great engine of life. This great\r\nprinciple known as mind, must depend for all evidences on the five\r\nsenses, and on this testimony, all mental conclusions are bad, and all\r\norders from this mental court are issued to move to any point or stop at\r\nany place. Thus to obtain good results, we must blend ourselves with,\r\nand travel in harmony with nature's truths. When this great machine man,\r\nceases to move in all its parts, which we call death, the explorers\r\nknife discovers no mind, no motion. He simply finds formulated matter\r\nwith no motor to move it, with no mind to direct it. He can trace the\r\nchannels through which the fluids have circulated, he can find the\r\nrelation of parts to other parts; in fact by the knife, he can expose to\r\nview the whole machinery that once was wisely active. Suppose the\r\nexplorer is able to add the one principle motion, at once we would see\r\nan action, but it would be a confused action. Still he is not the man\r\ndesired to be produced. There is one addition that is indispensable to\r\ncontrol this active body, or machine, and that is mind. With that added\r\nthe whole machinery then works as man. The three when united in full\r\naction are able to exhibit the thing desired--complete.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSTEOPATHY TO CURE DISEASE.\r\n\r\nThe Osteopath seeks first physiological perfection of form, by normally\r\nadjusting the osseous frame work, so that all arteries may deliver blood\r\nto nourish and construct all parts. Also that the veins may carry away\r\nall impurities dependent upon them for renovation. Also that the nerves\r\nof all classes may be free and unobstructed while applying the powers of\r\nlife and motion to all divisions, and the whole system of nature's\r\nlaboratory.\r\n\r\nA full and complete supply of arterial blood must be generated and\r\ndelivered to all parts, organs and glands, by the channels called the\r\narteries. And when it has done its work, then without delay the veins\r\nmust return all to heart and lungs for renewal. We must know some delay\r\nof fluids has been established on which nature begins the work of\r\nrenewal by increased action of electricity, even to the solvent action\r\nof fever heat, by which watery substances evaporate and relieve the\r\nlymphatic system of stagnant, watery secretions. Thus fever is a natural\r\nand powerful remedy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OSTEOPATH SHOULD FIND HEALTH.\r\n\r\nTo find health should be the object of the doctor. Anyone can find\r\ndisease. He should make the grand round among the sentinels and\r\nascertain if they are asleep, dead or have deserted their posts, and\r\nhave allowed the enemy to get into camps. He should visit all posts.\r\nBefore he goes out to make the rounds, he should know where all posts\r\nare, and the value of the supply he has charge of, whether it be shot,\r\nshell, grub, clothing, arms or anything of value to the Company or\r\nDivision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nOSTEOPATHIC EXPLORATIONS.\r\n\r\n     Divisions of the Body--Searching for the Cause--Duty of the\r\n     Osteopathic Explorer--Classification and Division--The\r\n     Abnormal--Nerve Powers--Witnesses to Examine--Abnormal\r\n     Growths--Cerebro Spinal Fluid--Body in Perfect\r\n     Health--Chemistry--Nature's Chemistry.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVISIONS OF THE BODY.\r\n\r\nAfter many long years, treating and trying to teach the student of\r\nOsteopathy how to hunt for and find the local causes of diseases, not\r\ncontagious, or infectious, I have succeeded in planning and suggesting a\r\nmethod, which I am sure the doctor can easily follow, and find any\r\ndiversion from the normal, that would interfere with the nerves, veins,\r\nand arteries, of any organ or limb of the body. I have formulated a\r\nsimple mental diagram that divides the body into three parts, chest,\r\nupper and lower limbs. The first division takes in head, neck, chest,\r\nabdomen and pelvis. The second division takes in head, neck, lower and\r\nupper arm and hand. The third division takes in foot, leg, thigh, pelvis\r\nand lumbar vertebra. I make this division for the purpose of holding the\r\nexplorer to the limits of all supplies. In the ellipse of the chest is\r\nfound all vital supplies; then from that center of life we have two\r\nbranches only, one of the arm, and one of the lower limb. In each\r\ndivision we have five points of exploration.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Explore: (1) To seek for or after: to strive to attain by\r\nsearch; to look wisely and carefully for; to search through or into; to\r\npenetrate or range over for discovery; to examine thoroughly; as, to\r\nexplore new countries or seas; to explore the depths of science; \"hidden\r\nfrauds (to) explore.\"--WEBSTER.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSEARCHING FOR THE CAUSE.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate, we will take the lower limb, whether there is lameness,\r\nsoreness, gouty, rheumatic, neuralgic, swollen, shrunken, feverish,\r\ncold, smooth and glassy, sores, ulcers, erysipelas, milkleg, varicose\r\nveins, or any defect that the patient may complain of, who is the only\r\nreliable book or being of symptomatology. For convenience we will divide\r\nthat lower limb into five parts, the foot, leg, thigh, pelvis and lumbar\r\nregion. The patient (symptomatologist) tells us he has a pain in front,\r\ncenter and under part of foot. Now the doctor or bird dog, can find\r\nquails of reason in but one field that would lead him to the cause. As\r\nthis field is divided into five parts and the hunter has carefully\r\nsearched four divisions, he will find the cause or causes in the fifth\r\nand none other. If a dislocated bone is not found in the foot after\r\nascertaining that there has been no crushing by falling bodies, horses\r\nfeet, stepping on glass, nails and other things that would penetrate the\r\nfoot, and irritate by being broken off, closed and remaining in the\r\nflesh; we will explore the leg for the quail, ascertain if the\r\narticulation is normal at ankle and knee. If we find the bone is not\r\nbroken, the leg has no splinters of wood, nor injured flesh by bites\r\nfrom dogs or other animals, nor any other substance that would injure\r\nthe leg, we are prepared to pass on and explore another place for pain\r\nin the foot. We go on to division No. 3 or the thigh division, and\r\nascertain if the thigh is normal in all conditions, properly in socket,\r\nwith all muscles, ligaments and nerves unoppressed. There are but two\r\nmore divisions left for exploration, and they are the most important and\r\ninteresting of the five, the pelvis and lumbar, through which all the\r\nnerves of the limb pass. We must stop at pelvis and observe carefully\r\nthat there is no twist of ligaments before going to lumbar, which is the\r\nlast of the five divisions. If we have found nothing in the previous\r\nfour, and have explored them as carefully as we should, we have but one\r\nbrush heap left, and that one contains the quail that we have been\r\nhunting for. As the lumbar contains and conveys all nerve forces to the\r\npelvis from the brain and all divisions of the lower limbs, we will now\r\nexamine the articulations of that part of the spine, and in that we are\r\nvery certain to find the cause if we have made no mistake in our\r\nexamination in the preceding divisions of the limb. As we enter the\r\nexploration of this part of the spine we must remember that we are about\r\nto deal with the many divisions of the nerves of the _cauda equina_. The\r\ngreat question before us, comes after this form. What would wound or\r\nbruise any division of nerves that would lead by the way of the great or\r\nlesser sciatic, to a bone in the front and under side of the foot? Jars,\r\nstrains, twists, and dislocations, must be carefully searched for. A\r\npartial dislocation of one side of the spine would produce a twist which\r\nwould throw one muscle on to another and another, straining ligaments,\r\nproducing conjestion and inflammation, or some irritation that would\r\nlead to a suspension of the fluids necessary to the harmonious vitality\r\nof the foot, which is the great and only cause by which the suffering is\r\nproduced in a foreign land, which we call a famine in the foot.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTY OF THE OSTEOPATHIC EXPLORER.\r\n\r\nThis method of exploration is not directed by the sound of the fog-horns\r\nof unreliable and unsatisfactory symptomatology. Osteopathy has a method\r\nof its own, which is correct or it has no method at all, and is guided\r\nby the surveyor's compass that will find all corners as established by\r\nthe orders of the government and surveyor's general. Thus an Osteopath\r\nmust find the true corners as set by the Divine Surveyor. The general\r\nsurveyor hands our plats and specifications to the division general,\r\nwith instructions to establish all lines and divisions, state, county,\r\ntownship and sections, and mark each one by stones or otherwise, so they\r\ncannot be lost; but are findable by any competent surveyor who follows\r\nthe field notes displayed in anatomy. Thus you would see a successful\r\nOsteopath is guided by the field notes of nature to all corners, his\r\nbusiness is to know that every corner stone is in its place, standing\r\nerect as nature designed and established it. If he tolerates any\r\nvariation of this stone or stones from the place or places that God the\r\ngrand surveyor of the universe has placed them, he will observe there is\r\nan infringement and cause for inharmony and discord of the possessors of\r\nthe four quarter sections of land, for which this cornerstone was\r\nplaced; and his sworn duty is to bring this stone from any variation\r\nfrom the field notes and establish it where it was first placed. Thus\r\nhis ability to find the true corners and adjust all stones will mark him\r\nas a successful Osteopath.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION AND DIVISION.\r\n\r\nI will classify or divide man's body for convenience of exploration for\r\ndiseases into head and neck first; then head, neck and chest, third,\r\nhead, neck, chest and abdomen; then unite head, neck, chest, abdomen and\r\nsacrum. I will take up a few diseases under each division as they are\r\nlocated. By this method I think I can better show what nerves should be\r\nmore or less active.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ABNORMAL.\r\n\r\nA lesion may and does appear on a part or all of the person which may\r\nappear as a growth or withering away of a limb in all its muscles,\r\nnerves and blood supply. As in case of tumors on scalp, loss of hair,\r\neruptions of face, growth of tonsils, ulcers of one or both ears,\r\ngrowths on outside and inside of eyes, a cause must precede an effect in\r\nall cases. A pain in head is an effect; cause is older than the effect\r\nand is absolute in all variations from normal conditions. A tumor on the\r\nhead and under the skin is an effect only. It took matter to give it\r\nsize, it took power to deliver that substance, the fact that a tumor was\r\nformed, shows that the power to build was present and did the work of\r\nconstruction. Another power should have been there to complete the work\r\nat that location; that power is the offbearing of the dead matter after\r\nthe work of construction was complete.\r\n\r\n\r\nNERVE POWERS.\r\n\r\nIf we think as men of reason should, we will count five nerve powers.\r\nThey must all be present to build a part, and must answer promptly at\r\nroll call and work all the time. The names of these master workmen are\r\nsensation, motion, nutrition, voluntary and involuntary. All must answer\r\nat every roll call during life; none can be granted a leave of absence\r\nfor a moment. Suppose sensation should leave a limb for a time, have we\r\nnot a giving away of all cells and glands? An undue filling up follows\r\nquickly because sensation limits and tells when the supply is too great\r\nfor the use of the builder's purpose. Suppose the nerve power known as\r\nmotion should fail for a time, starvation would soon begin its deadly\r\nwork for want of food. Suppose again the nerves of nutrition should fail\r\nto apply the nourishing showers we would surely die in sight of food.\r\nWith the voluntary nerves we move or stay at the will of he or she who\r\nwishes to give direction to the motor powers, at any time a change by\r\naction is required. At this time I will stop defining the several and\r\nvaried uses of the five kinds of nerves, and begin to account for\r\ngrowths and other variations, from the healthy to the unhealthy\r\nconditions of man. The above named are the five known powers of animal\r\nlife, and to direct them wisely is the work of the doctor of\r\nOsteopathy.\r\n\r\n\r\nWITNESSES TO EXAMINE.\r\n\r\nHe has five witnesses to examine in all cases he has under his care. He\r\nmust give close attention to the source and supply of healthy blood. If\r\nblood is too scant he must look to the motor systems of blood making,\r\nthat would surely invite his most careful attention and study of the\r\nabdomen. He cannot expect blood to quietly pass through the diaphragm if\r\nimpeded by muscular constriction around aorta, vena cava or thoracic\r\nduct. The diaphragm can and is often pulled down on both vena cava and\r\nthoracic duct, obstructing blood and chyle from returning to heart so\r\nmuch as to limit the chyle below the requirement of healthy blood, or\r\neven suppress the nerve action of lymphatics to such degree as to cause\r\ndropsy of the abdomen, or a stoppage of venous blood by pressure on vena\r\ncava so long that venous blood would be in stages of ferment when it\r\nenters the heart for renovation, and when purified and returned the\r\nsupply is too small to sustain life to a normal standard.\r\n\r\n\r\nABNORMAL GROWTHS.\r\n\r\nThus the importance of a careful attention to the normal certainty of\r\nall the ribs to which the diaphragm is attached is essential. The\r\neleventh and twelfth ribs may, and do often get pushed so far from their\r\nnormal bearings, that they are often found turned in a line with the\r\nspine, with cartilaginous ends down near ilio-lumbar articulation. When\r\nin such position they draw the diaphragm down heavily on vena cava at\r\nabout the fourth lumbar. Then you have cause for intermittent pulse, as\r\nthe heart finds no passage of blood through the prolapsed diaphragm\r\nwhich is also stopping the vena cava and producing universal stagnation\r\nof blood and other fluids in all organs and glands below the diaphragm.\r\nThus you have a beginning for abnormal growths of womb, kidneys and all\r\nlymphatics of liver, kidneys, spleen, pancreas, and all tumors of\r\nabdomen.\r\n\r\n\r\nCEREBRO SPINAL FLUID.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy the mind of a philosopher who is mentally capable of asking\r\nfor and knowing truth, when presented by nature, you must come at him\r\noutside of the limits of conjecture, and address him with self-evident\r\ntruths only. When he takes up the philosophy of the great subject of\r\nlife, to him who does know truth, no substitute can to any degree\r\nsatisfy his mental demands. To the one who would deal in conjectures or\r\nsuppose so's, he will at once be placed in the proper category to which\r\nhe belongs, which is the drift-wood that floats down the dark river that\r\nis overshadowed by the nightmare of ignorance and superstition. A\r\nseeker after truth, is a man of few words, and they are used by him only\r\nby the truths or facts discovered. He has no patience with the unmeaning\r\nrecords offered only to please the credulous, and by those of little or\r\nno truth that appears during a long recitation of ungrounded statements.\r\nFrom the above it is wisely seen that the object of these remarks is to\r\npresent a few truths for the purpose of stimulating the attention of the\r\nlistener. We will take man when formed. When we use the word formed, we\r\nmean the whole building being complete. The brain with all organs,\r\nnerves, vessels, and every minutia in form with all materials found or\r\nused in life.\r\n\r\n\r\nBODY IN PERFECT HEALTH.\r\n\r\nWe look at it in perfect health which means perfection and harmony not\r\nin part, but of the whole body. So far we are only filled with love,\r\nwonder and admiration. Another period of observation appears to the\r\nphilosopher. We find partial or universal discord from the lowest\r\nobservable to the highest in action and death. Then the book of whys is\r\nopened and displays its leaves which calls out mental labor even to the\r\ndegree of agony, to know the cause or causes that produce a failure of a\r\nlimb in sensation, motion, nutrition, voluntary and involuntary\r\nfunctional exhibits. His mind will explore the bone, the ligament, the\r\nmuscle, the fascia, the channels through which the blood travels from\r\nheart to local destiny, with lymphatics and their contents,--the nerves,\r\nthe blood vessels and every channel through or over which all substances\r\nare transmitted all over the body, particularly the disabled limb in\r\nquestion. It proceeds too and does obtain blood abundantly to and from\r\nthe heart, but the results obtained are not satisfactory, and another\r\nleaf is opened of why no good results are obtained and where is the\r\nmystery, what quality and element of force and vitality has been\r\nwithheld? A thought strikes him that the cerebro spinal fluid is the\r\nhighest known element that is contained in the human body, and unless\r\nthe brain furnishes this fluid in abundance a disabled condition of the\r\nbody will remain. He who is able to reason will see that this great\r\nriver of life must be tapped and the withering field irrigated at once,\r\nor the harvest of health be forever lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\nAs chemical compounds are not known to Osteopathy to be used as\r\nremedies, then its use as a study for the student is only to teach that\r\nelements in nature do combine and form other substances, and without\r\nchanges and unions, no teeth, bone, hair, or muscle could appear in the\r\nbody from the food eaten. Then chemistry is of great use as a part of a\r\nthorough Osteopathic education. It gives us the reasons why food is\r\nfound in the body as bone, muscle and so on, to all kinds of flesh,\r\nteeth and bones found in animal forms. Unless we know chemistry\r\nreasonably well, we can not do away with much mental worry of what\r\nbecomes of food after eating. By chemistry the truths of physiology are\r\nfirmly established in the mind of the student of nature, that in man a\r\nchemistry of wonderful powers does all the work of animal forms, and\r\nthat in the laboratory of nature's chemistry is the ruling power. By\r\nelementary chemistry we are led to see the beauties of physiology only.\r\nThus chemistry of the elementary is one, and physiology is the witness\r\nthat it is law in man as in all nature. Thus in chemistry we comprehend\r\nsome of the laws of union in nature which we can use mentally with\r\nknowing confidence. In chemistry we become acquainted with the law of\r\ncause and change in union, which is a standard law sought by the student\r\nof Osteopathy.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE'S CHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\nOsteopathy believes that all parts of the human body do work on chemical\r\ncompounds, and from the general supply manufacture for local wants; thus\r\nthe liver builds for itself of the material that is prepared in its own\r\ndivision laboratory. The same of heart and brain. No disturbing or\r\nhindering causes will be tolerated to stay if an Osteopath can find and\r\nremove it. We must reason that to withhold the supply from a limb, to\r\nwither away would be natural. We suffer from two causes. First, want of\r\nsupply (hunger), and the burdens of dead deposits along nerve centers,\r\nwhich five nerves by chemical changes while in fermentation should\r\nregulate local or general divisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORRECT METHOD OF REASONING.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this chapter we will confine our labor to an effort to\r\ndirect the beginner to a correct method of reasoning. When he is brought\r\nface to face with the stern realities of the \"sick room,\" the Osteopath\r\nbegins his inquiries and follows with his questions just far enough to\r\nknow what division of the body is in trouble. If he finds an arm has\r\nlost motion, he goes to arm to explore for cause. He can begin his hunt\r\nfor cause at hand, explore it carefully for wounds, strains or any\r\nlesion that could injure nerves of the arm. If he finds no probable\r\ncause there, he should explore bones for dislocations or strains of\r\nligaments at elbow; if he finds no defect there sufficient to locate\r\ncause in lower arm or hand; he has only two more places left to inspect,\r\nthe shoulder and neck with their articulations of bone and muscles. If\r\nfound normal at shoulder, then go to neck, out of which go all or most\r\nof the nerves of the arm; if he finds no lesion or cause equal to the\r\ntrouble so far, then he has been careless in his search and should go\r\nover and over from marrow to periostium of all bones of the neck and\r\nhead, because there are only five divisions in which a lesion can exist.\r\nCarefully look, think, feel and know that the head of the humerus is\r\ntrue in the glenoid cavity, clavicle true at both ends of its\r\narticulation, with sternum and acromion processes. See that the biceps\r\nare in their grooves, and ribs on spine are true at manubrium and spine,\r\nand that neck is true on first dorsal. True in all joints of the neck,\r\nas the nerves of the arm come from the neck, there must be no variation\r\nfrom normal, or trouble will appear from that cause. As the neck has\r\nmuch to do with the arm, we should keep a living picture of the forms of\r\neach bone, how and where it articulates with others, how it is joined by\r\nligaments, what blood vessels, nerves and muscles cross or range with it\r\nlengthwise, because to overlook a small nerve and blood vessel you may\r\nfail to remove a goitre, and all diseases of the head, face and neck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE HEAD.\r\n\r\n     A Free Circulation--Death Blows--Something of the Neck--Order of\r\n     Treatment--The Pelvis--Brains of Animals--Arterial Motion--Mental\r\n     Vibrations--Overburdening the Mind--Hemiplegia.\r\n\r\n\r\nA FREE CIRCULATION.\r\n\r\nBefore we treat of the head, we must follow blood from the heart to all\r\norgans of the head. Not only look at the pictures in Gray, Morris,\r\nGerrish, or some finely illustrated work on anatomy, but we must apply a\r\nsearching hand and know to a certainty that the constrictors of neck, or\r\nother muscles or ligaments do not pull cervical and hyoid bones so close\r\nas to bruise pneumogastric or any other nerves or fibres that would\r\ncause spasmodic contraction of digastric, stylo-hyoid or the whole\r\nremaining group of neck muscles and ligaments, with which you are or\r\nshould be very familiar. Ever remember that the venous drainage must be\r\nkept normally active or congestion, and tumefaction, with inflammation\r\nof the glands of the head, face and neck will appear, and mark for you\r\nthis oversight; because the perpetual health, ease and comfort of the\r\nhead beginning with the scalp and hair, with their nerves, glands and\r\npurity of blood supply, a healthy eye, good hearing, healthy action of\r\nbrain with its magnetic and electric forces to the vital parts which\r\nsustain life, memory and reason, depend directly and wholly upon\r\nunlimited freedom of the circulatory system of nerves, blood and\r\ncerebral fluid. They must be normal in action and quantity\r\nunembarrassed, otherwise bad hearing, ulcers of the ears, cross eyes,\r\npterygium, cataract, granulated lids, staphyloma, lachrymosis and up to\r\nfull list of diseases of the eye, with tonsilitis, injured voice, tumors\r\nand cancers of face, head, tongue, mouth and throat, along with\r\nerysipelas, blotches and pimples, and all diseases of the glandular\r\nsystem of the head and neck. Undoubtedly all these afflictions have\r\ntheir origin in obstructed normal action between the heart and the\r\ntermination of all above it, for want of nerve and blood harmony.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH BLOWS.\r\n\r\nRemember that death blows are dealt out freely above the sternum by\r\nirritation and constriction of the parts above described. We should\r\noften refresh our minds, beginning with the muscles that connect the\r\nhead and neck, and know to a certainty as we explore that junction that\r\nthe capitas minor, major and lateralis, long and short of both anticus\r\nand posticus regions are indisputably normal to your hand and judgment.\r\nIt is almost useless to say to the anatomist who has had the drilling in\r\nall branches of that science, previous to obtaining his diploma, to\r\ncommence and detail the venous and excretory system, through which all\r\nthose glands are drained, and kept in a healthy condition, but we say\r\nthis much; let your morning, noon and evening prayer be this, Oh Lord!\r\ngive me more anatomy each day I live, because experience has taught me\r\nthe unavoidable demands when in the \"sick room.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMETHING OF THE NECK.\r\n\r\nBefore you leave that wisely constructed neck, I want to press and\r\nimprint on your minds in the strongest terms that the wisest anatomist,\r\nand physiologist, the oldest and most successful Osteopath knows only\r\nenough of the neck, and its wondrous system of nerves, blood and muscles\r\nand its relation to all above and below it, to say, \"From everlasting to\r\neverlasting thou art great, O Lord God Almighty!\" Thy wisdom is surely\r\nboundless, for I see that man must be wise to know all about the neck,\r\nfor we find by a twist of neck, we may become blind, deaf, spasmodic,\r\nlose speech and memory, and all that is known as the joys of man. On\r\nthat division of the body all action of arms, legs, chest and all\r\nmuscles get their life--power and motion. Think for a moment of the\r\nthousands and tens of thousands of large and small fluid vessels that\r\npass to and from heart and brain, to every organ, bone, fibre, muscle\r\nand gland, both large and small, receiving and appropriating the\r\nsubstances as prepared in the chemical laboratory; so wisely situated,\r\nand so exact in all its works in the production and application of all\r\nsubstances in the body.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER OF TREATMENT.\r\n\r\nThe reader will begin with the brain or head because I want to start\r\nwith the head; first give such diseases as belong to that division of\r\nthe body. Then the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis. Thus we have five\r\ndivisions in regular order, beginning with the head and finishing with\r\nthe sacrum. The reader will find diseases of eye, ear, tongue, nose,\r\nface, scalp and hair under the chapter treating of the head. Next in\r\nregular order will be the division of the neck, with diseases of tonsils\r\nand glands of neck, swallow, trachæ, nerves, blood vessels and muscles,\r\nfascia and lymphatics, superior cervical ganglion and other nerves of\r\nthe neck, as they affect vitality in diseases. Then we pass on to third\r\ndivision, with diseases of lung, heart, pericardium, and pleura, with\r\nall parts of chest. Then abdomen, liver, stomach and bowels, and all\r\norgans with resisting power of diaphragm. Fifth, pelvis, with its great\r\nsupply of nerves, blood and other fluids. These give us cause to halt\r\nand seat the mind for a long season of observation. A great field opens\r\nat this point for the observing thinker.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PELVIS.\r\n\r\nIn the pelvis we find a system of nerves and arteries with blood for\r\nlocal supply, besides blood to construct womb, bladder, rectum, colon,\r\ncellular system and all the muscles of that cavity (the pelvis) all of\r\nwhich comes from arteries and branches above. We think it is not\r\nnecessary to name them only in bulk, to a student versed in anatomy.\r\nPerhaps less is known of the pelvic system and its functions than any\r\ndivision of the body, and for that reason I have felt that we should\r\nknow all that is possible to be learned. I believe more ignorance\r\nprevails to-day of internal causes of diseases than would if we reasoned\r\nthat the pelvic nerves and vessels had much to do in forming the\r\nabdominal viscera.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRAIN OF ANIMALS.\r\n\r\nOf all parts of the body of man to be well studied, the brain should be\r\nthe most attractive. It is the place where all force centers, where all\r\nnerves connect to one common battery. By its orders the laboratory of\r\nlife begins to move on crude material and labors until blood is formed\r\nand becomes food for all nerves first; then arteries and veins by nerve\r\naction and forces, to suit each class of work to be done by that set of\r\nnerves which is to construct forms; keep blood constantly in motion by\r\nthe arteries and from all parts back to the heart, through the veins,\r\nthat the blood may be purified, renewed and re-enter the arteries to be\r\ntaken to all places of need.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTERIAL MOTION.\r\n\r\nArterial motion is normal during all ages, from the quick pulse of the\r\nbabe's arm, to the ages of each year to one hundred or more. At this\r\ngreat age the pulse is so slow that the heat is not generated by the\r\nnerves, whose motor velocity is not great enough to bring electricity to\r\nthe stage of heat. All heat, high and low, surely is the effect of\r\nactive electricity--plus to fever; minus to coldness. When an irritant\r\nenters the body by lung, skin or any other way, a change appears in the\r\nheart's action from its effects on the brain, to the high electric\r\naction and that burning heat called fever. If plus violent type (yellow\r\nfever), if minus, low grades (typhus, typhoid, plagues), and so on\r\nthrough the list.\r\n\r\n\r\nMENTAL VIBRATIONS.\r\n\r\nTo think implies action of the brain. We can grade thought although we\r\ncannot measure its speed.\r\n\r\nSuppose a person of one kind of business thinks just fast enough to suit\r\nthat profession. A man is engaged in raising hogs and that alone. He\r\nmust reason on and of the nature of hogs. He begins about so: a hog\r\neats, drinks, bathes, roots and sleeps. He knows the hog eats grain, so\r\nhe feeds it corn, or some other suitable cereal, with plenty of water\r\nand good bedding. The swine is on his mind night and day.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WHEELS OF THOUGHT.\r\n\r\nNow the question is, how fast does he think? How many revolutions do the\r\nwheels of his head make per minute to do all the necessary thinking\r\nconnected with the hog business? Say his mental wheels revolve 100 times\r\neach minute. Then he adds sheep to his business, and if that should\r\nrequire 100 more revolutions and he takes charge of raising draft horses\r\nwith 175 revolutions added, you see the wheels of his head whizzing off\r\n375 vibrations per minute. And at this time he adds the duties of the\r\ncarpenter with 300 more revolutions, add them together and you see 675.\r\nTo this number he adds the duties and thoughts of a sheriff, which are\r\nnumerous enough to buzz his wheels at 1500 more, you find 2175 to be\r\nhis mental revolutions so far. Now you have the great physical demands\r\nadded to the mental motion which his brain has to support, yet he can do\r\nall so far, fairly well.\r\n\r\n\r\nOVERBURDENING THE MIND.\r\n\r\nHe now adds to his labors the manufacturing of leather, from all kinds\r\nof hides, with the chemistry of fine tanning, which is equal to all\r\nprevious mental motions. Add and you find 4250 revolutions all drawing\r\non his brain each minute of the day. Add to this mental strain the\r\nincreased action of his body which has to perform these duties and you\r\nsee the beginning of a worry of both mind and body, to which you add\r\nmanufacturing of engines, iron puddling, rolling, etc.; a delegate to a\r\nnational convention, thoughts of the death of a near relative; add to\r\nthis a security debt to meet during a money panic. By this time the mind\r\nbegins to fag below the power of resistance.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEMIPLEGIA.\r\n\r\nDuration of such great mental vibrations for so long stops nutrition of\r\nall or one-half of the brain, and we have a case of \"Hemiplegia,\" or the\r\nwheels of one-half of the brain run so fast as to overcome some fountain\r\nof nerve force and explode some cerebral artery in the brain and deposit\r\na clot of blood at some motor supply or plexus.\r\n\r\nThus we see men from over mental action fall in our National councils,\r\ncourts, manufactories, churches, and almost all places of great mental\r\nactivity. Slaves and savages seldom fall victims to paralysis of any\r\nkind, but escape all such, for they know nothing of the strains of mind\r\nand hurried nutrition. They eat and rest, live long and happy. The idea\r\nof riches never bothers their slumbers. Physical injuries may and often\r\ndo wound motor, sensory and nutrient centers of brain; but the effect is\r\njust the same, partial or complete suspension of the motor and sensory\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\nIf you burst a boiler by high pressure or otherwise, your engine ceases\r\nto move. And just the same of an over-worked brain or body.\r\n\r\nHemiplegia. \"The half\" and \"I strike.\" Paralysis of one half of the\r\nbody.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Chambers.]\r\n\r\nHemiplegia is usually the result of a cerebral hemorrhage or embolism.\r\nIt sometimes occurs suddenly without other marked symptoms, but commonly\r\nit is ushered in by an apoplectic attack and on return of consciousness\r\nit is observed that one side of the body is paralyzed, the paralysis\r\nbeing often profound in the beginning, and disappearing to a greater or\r\nless extent at a later period.\r\n\r\nHemiplegia is much more rarely produced by a tumor. It then generally\r\ncomes on slowly, the paralysis gradually increasing as the neoplasm\r\nencroaches more and more upon the motor tracks, though the tumor may be\r\ncomplicated by the occurrence of a hemorrhage and a sudden hemiplegia.\r\n\r\nA gradual hemiplegia may also be produced by an abcess or chronic\r\nsoftening of the brain substance. Other conditions or symptoms\r\npresented, will in such case, assist us to diagnose the nature of the\r\nlesion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nEAR WAX AND ITS USES.\r\n\r\n     Nature Makes Nothing in Vain--A Successful Experiment--A Question\r\n     for Ages--The Position--Meaning of Life--Some Questions\r\n     Asked--Condition in Certain Diseases Caused by Cold--Cerumen in\r\n     Fluid State--Winter Kills Babies--Some Advice to Mothers--A Case in\r\n     Point--Connection of the brain and Other Nerves in\r\n     Digestion--Unaided Investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE MAKES NOTHING IN VAIN.\r\n\r\nThat nature makes nothing in vain is an established truth in the minds\r\nof all persons whose observation has created in such persons a desire to\r\nreason, and that being my faith for many years I asked myself to try and\r\nget a reason of why nature had made and placed in a person's head so\r\nmuch fine machinery just to make a little ear-wax. If nothing is made in\r\nvain, what is that bitter stuff made for? It is always there, and more\r\nbeing made all the time. I have read many authors or say so's about\r\near-wax, and about the best the wise or the unwise have said is that it\r\nwould keep bugs and other insects out of our heads. I thought if that\r\nwas all that it was made for nature had done a great deal to shoo off\r\nthe bugs. The idea that it was made bitter and bad to eat just to make\r\nbugs sick was weak philosophy, if nature never did any useless work or\r\nmade anything in vain. At this time I saw the doors all open and a good\r\nchance for the loaded mind to unload and give us other uses for ear-wax\r\nthan bug food, and to lubricate the auditory nerves with dry wax. At\r\nthis time of my desire to know some positive use or object that nature\r\nhad in forming so much fine machinery and no use for its products when\r\nmade, but to pull out of the head with a hairpin, I reasoned about so,\r\nthat this dry hard wax was once in the gaseous or fluid state.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SUCCESSFUL EXPERIMENT.\r\n\r\nWhen I had about concluded to sit down with the common herd of doctors\r\nand say that wax was wax, a fat boy of two summers was reported to me to\r\nbe dying with croup. I began to think more about the dry wax that is\r\nalways found in cases of croup, sore throat, tonsilitis, pneumonia, and\r\nall diseases of the lungs, nose and head. On examination I found the\r\near-wax dried up. So I put a few drops of glycerine, and after a\r\nminute's time a few drops of warm water in the child's head, and kept a\r\nwet rag corked into its ear frequently for twelve hours, and gave it\r\nOsteopathic treatment, at the end of which time all signs of croup had\r\ndisappeared. I used the glycerine to soften the wax, which combining\r\nwith water formed a harmless soap better qualified for washing the ear,\r\nand retaining the wax in solution than anything I have tried, for it is\r\nmy opinion that the ear wax should be kept in a fluid state. When in\r\nthat state the absorbent can more readily take it up and use it in the\r\neconomy of life in this condition. The same day two ladies came to my\r\nhouse, sore in lungs, necks tied up, sore throats, fever and headache.\r\nAs an experiment, in addition to Osteopathic treatment, I put a few\r\ndrops of glycerine in their ears, followed with water to wet and soften\r\nthe wax which was dry and hard, to get it back to a fluid state. Both\r\ngot better of their sore lungs and throats in a short time, and in\r\ntwenty-four hours they were about well, and lungs coughing out phlegm,\r\neasily. From this I think that the cause of croup is simply the result\r\nof abnormality of the cerumen system.\r\n\r\n\r\nA QUESTION FOR AGES.\r\n\r\nAs a question of the uses of ear-wax has been before man for ages\r\nwithout an answer being given that passes the line of conjecture, I\r\nthink there could be no reason why a few looks through the field glass\r\nof inquiry should not be given in a limited way on that great plane of\r\nfertility, for the minds of our most profound thinkers. As far as the\r\nwriter can learn from reading and other methods of inquiry, the power\r\nand use of ear-wax has never been known, looked on, or thought of as one\r\nof life's agents for good or bad health. One asks this question: \"Why\r\nare you talking about ear-wax, the filthy stuff?\" In answer I asked,\r\n\"What do you know about ear-wax?\" The answer, \"I don't know or care\r\nanything about the dirty stuff.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POSITION.\r\n\r\nAs my spleen is my organ of mirth, I let it bounce against my side a few\r\ntimes at such ignorance and gave the wax subject more study than ever--I\r\nbegan to read all the books I could find on Anatomy, Physiology, and\r\nHistology to get some knowledge of the machinery that the wise architect\r\nof that greatest of all temples had made to generate wax. At this time a\r\nconviction came to me to be sure of its uses before I gave an opinion. I\r\nfind the center of nerve supply of the ears located at the base of the\r\nbrain and side of the head, in front of the cerebellum, just below and\r\nnear the center of the brain, a little above the foramen magnum, close\r\nto and behind the carotid arteries, deep and superficial, just above the\r\nentry of the spinal cord to the brain. Thus it is situated directly in\r\ncommunication with all nerves to and from the brain to every part of the\r\nbody. Another question, and another came only to come and go without an\r\nanswer--such as how and where is this wax made? Of what use is it? Why\r\nso awful bitter? Has it any living principle above dry earth? Is it\r\nproduced in the brain, lymphatics, fascia, heart, lungs, nerves or\r\nwhere? How much of it would kill a man? Would it kill at all? What is it\r\nmade for? Is it used by nerves as food, or used by lungs, heart, or any\r\norgan as an active principle in the magnetic or electric forces? So far\r\nall authors are silent even to offer a speculative opinion about how it\r\nis made and its uses. So far we get nothing from the ancient or modern\r\nwriters, as to its uses or anything that would cause a man to think that\r\nthe Creator had any great design, when he made so wisely constructed and\r\nso much machinery and gave it such prominent place in the center of the\r\nbrain. By this time the reader begins to mentally ask what does this wax\r\nevangelist know about the wax and its uses? The writer wishes to observe\r\nand respect all nature and never be too hasty. To carefully explore all,\r\nand never leave until he finds the cause and use that nature's hand has\r\nplaced in its works, never overlooking small packages as they often\r\ncontain precious gems. I am sure no man of brilliant mind can pass this\r\nmilepost and not hitch his team and do some precious loading. At this\r\npoint my pen will give notice to all anatomists, histologists, chemists\r\nand physiologists that I will give \"no sleep nor slumber to their\r\neyes,\" until I hear from them an answer, yes or no to these questions:\r\nFor what purpose did God make ear-wax? Is it food or refuse? If food,\r\nwhat is nourished by it? and how do you know your position is true and\r\nundebatable?\r\n\r\n\r\nMEANING OF LIFE.\r\n\r\nLife means existence; existence means subsistence; subsistence means\r\nsomething to subsist on, and of the degree of refinement to suit the\r\nbeing or principle whose function is to do the skilled work which is\r\nfound marked on the tressle-board of the wisest of all builders, whose\r\nwork is absolutely correct in form and action, and beautiful to behold.\r\nIt calls out the admiration of man and God himself, who did say of man,\r\n\"Not only good, but very good.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME QUESTIONS ASKED.\r\n\r\nI consider ear-wax one of the most important questions before the minds\r\nof our physiologists. The first and only knowledge of which substance\r\nbegins with the observer's eye when he beholds the dry wax as it is\r\nexcreted and dropped into the cavities of the ears. A question\r\narises--and stands without an answer--is this substance which is\r\ncommonly called ear-wax, technically called cerumen, is it dead or is it\r\nalive while in this form and visible? If dead, why, and how did it lose\r\nits life? Why has it not been consumed if once a living substance? When\r\nalive, is it in the gaseous or fluid state? and when alive, and consumed\r\nas nutriment by the system what does it nourish? is the question for the\r\nphilosopher's attention, not superficial, but his deepest thought? Why\r\nis it deposited in the center of the brain if not to impart its vital\r\nprinciple to all nerves interested in life and nutrition--both physical\r\nand spiritual. Its location, itself, would indicate its importance.\r\nAnother thought is that no better place could be selected to establish\r\nand locate a universal supply office for the laborers of all parts of\r\nthe whole superstructure. Another question arises: When we examine a\r\nperson paralyzed on one side, why do we find this bread of life in such\r\ngreat quantities on the table and not consumed? Has not one-half of the\r\nbrain and the nerves of that whole side, limbs and all, lost their power\r\nof digestion? Is hemiplegia a dyspepsia of the nerves of nutriment of\r\nthe brain and organs of that side? If so we have some foundation on\r\nwhich to build an answer why this wax is not consumed and is dried up in\r\nthe ears of the parylytic. The answer would be that nutrition is\r\nsuspended.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS IN CERTAIN DISEASES, CAUSED BY COLDS.\r\n\r\nLet us take croup, diphtheria, scarlet fever, la grippe, and all classes\r\nof colds--on to pneumonia. They present about the same symptoms,\r\ndiffering more in degrees of severity than of place. All affect the\r\ntonsils, nostrils, membraneous air-passages, and lungs about the same\r\nway. Croup exceeds by contracting the trachea enough to impede the\r\npassing of air to the lungs; diphtheria has more swelling of the\r\ntonsils, throat and glands of the neck, but all depend upon the same\r\nblood and nerve supply, or a general law of blood beginning with\r\narteries to and from veins, lymphatics, glands and ducts to supply and\r\ntake away all fluids that are of no farther use to the vital and\r\nmaterial support. As all authors have agreed that the brain furnishes\r\nthe propelling forces to the nerves, it would be proper to inquire how\r\nthe brain is nourished. If so, we will begin and say the great cerebral\r\nsystem of arteries supply the brain of which it gives quality of all\r\nfluids and electric and magnetic forces, which must be generated in the\r\nbrain. Then a question arises, if the heart, lungs, liver, pancreas,\r\nlymphatics, kidneys and all parts of the body depend upon the brain for\r\npower, what do they give in return? If they give back anything it must\r\nbe of the kind of the organ from whence it comes; thus a kidney cannot\r\ngive liver nor spleen. Each must help to keep up the universal harmony\r\nby furnishing its mite of its own kind. Suppose lung fever is the effect\r\nof lack of renal salts, where would be a better place to dispatch from\r\nto renal organs than the ears to reach the brain and touch the nerve\r\nthat connects with the sympathetic ganglion.\r\n\r\n\r\nCERUMEN IN FLUID STATE.\r\n\r\nSuppose we take the cerumen in its fluid state, by the secretions to the\r\nlungs from the ears and see the action of air and other substances on\r\nit, and it on them. We may safely look for a general action of some\r\nkind. If it be magnetic food, we will see the magnetic power shown in\r\nthe lungs, and through the whole system, vitalizing all organs and\r\nfunctions of life. Thus the lymphatics will move to wash out impurities,\r\nand the nutritive nerves will rebuild lost energy. As but little is\r\nknown or said of how or where the cerumen is formed, we will guess it is\r\nformed under the skin in the glands of the fascia and conveyed to the\r\nears by the secretory ducts. Its place and how it is manufactured is not\r\nthe question of the greatest importance, but its uses in disease and\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTER KILLS BABIES.\r\n\r\nThe writer has much reason to believe he has found a reliable pointer\r\nfor the cause of croup, diphtheria, and pneumonia; also a rational and\r\neasy cure that any mother can administer and save the babe from choking\r\nto death in her arms. Having witnessed croup in all its deadly work for\r\nfifty years, and seen the best skill of each year and generation fail to\r\nsave, or even give relief, I lost all hope and grew to believe there was\r\nno help and the doctor was only one more witness to the scene of death\r\nand carnage found along the mysterious road that croup travels to slay\r\nthe babes of the whole earth. Of later days we have new and different\r\nnames for the disease, but alas, it kills the babe just as it did before\r\nit was called diphtheria, la grippe and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME ADVICE TO MOTHERS.\r\n\r\nI write this more for the mothers than for the critics. We say to\r\nmothers, as you are not Osteopaths, you are perfectly safe in putting\r\nglycerine in a child's ears. It is made from oils and fats. I believe\r\nwhen the wax is not consumed it clogs up the excretories with dead\r\nmatter, thus the irritation of the nerves of throat, neck, lungs and\r\nlymphatics which give cause for the swelling of the tonsils and glands\r\nof the neck. In this book can be found why I see wisdom in treating for\r\ncroup from the nerve centers of the brain. So far the uses and\r\nimportance of healthy ear-wax as a cure for disease has had no attention\r\nthat I can find by any author on disease or physiology. I hope time and\r\nattention may lead us to a better knowledge of the cure of diphtheria,\r\ncroup, scarlet fever and all diseases of the throat and lungs of\r\nchildren, and how to cure a greater per cent than has been up to this\r\nwriting. My experience up to date with such diseases, when treated as\r\nindicated, has been very encouraging. Though it is but a short time\r\nsince I began to treat by this method, it has proven good with the young\r\nand old.\r\n\r\nAs all authors so far seem silent even as to how or when the wax is\r\nformed, we must resort to much careful dissection to find the relation\r\nof the cerumen system to health. To intelligently acquaint the mother\r\nwith this treatment who does not understand anatomy so as to give\r\nOsteopathic treatment for croup, diphtheria, and so on, I will say; take\r\na soft wet cloth and wash the child's neck and rub gently down from ears\r\nto breast and shoulders; keep ears wet, often dropping in the glycerine.\r\nUse glycerine because it will mix with the water and dissolve the wax,\r\nwhile sweet oil and other oils will not do so.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CASE IN POINT.\r\n\r\nAt 2 o'clock p. m. I called to see a babe having malignant croup in its\r\nworst form, and examined its ears to see condition of wax. I had noticed\r\nin consumptives that some cases had great quantities of dry wax in one\r\nor both ears, but to this time had not thought of such deposits being an\r\nevidence of lost or suspended action of the nerves that manufactured\r\ncerumen. In this case I found wax dry and very hard, with much swelling\r\nand hardness in region of ears, eustachian tubes and tonsils. I reasoned\r\nthat the excretory duct had become clogged, and that by the wax being\r\nretained in ducts and glands an irritation of the nerves of the cervical\r\nlymphatics had caused contraction near head, and produced congestion of\r\nthe lymphatics, of the pneumogastric, and cutting off nerves supply from\r\nlungs. Believing this to be very likely I concluded to act on the above\r\nline of reasoning and see if I could give some relief. I did not stop to\r\ndebate why the wax was hard and dry, but how to soften the wax, was the\r\nquestion of interest to me then. So I proceeded. I reasoned that soap\r\nand water would be the best treatment to clean the ears, and soften the\r\nwax. At this point to select the best make of soap in the ears was to be\r\ndesired, so I took pure glycerine and water, dropped in a few drops and\r\ntook a small roll of cloth, made it wet in warm water and pushed it in\r\nears to keep them wet. In a few minutes I wet and inserted a soft cloth\r\ncork in the child's ears. I twisted the corks around in the ears, each\r\ntime to mix the water and the wax to a softened condition, for to keep\r\nthe wax wet was the object. In a few minutes I got the wax wet and the\r\nchild coughed up phlegm easily, and when the dreaded hour, ten o'clock\r\nat night came, all danger had passed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONNECTION OF BRAIN AND OTHER NERVES IN DIGESTION.\r\n\r\nIf digestion is the effect of organs, fluids and forces, then the\r\nstudent of nature's law must be governed by well known truths, such as\r\nthe location of the brain, connection of the nerves to other organs,\r\nbringing all parts interested in digestion in mental view. Thus you have\r\na chance to know if one organ has an assisting relation to any other\r\norgan or system or if its products are of general or of special use. A\r\nfew questions at this point of inquiry would be in place. Does the brain\r\ngive assistance in digestion, and why may we reasonably suppose so, when\r\ndigestion does its work normally and has a full, rich supply of blood?\r\nYet disease enters the system, and begins its work with general\r\nweakness, swelling, wastings, and pain with some, or all the glands\r\ncongested and sore, and a plenty of rich blood all the time. Then are we\r\njustified to go to the brain and examine the electric and magnetic\r\nbatteries? We know such forces exist but as their location in the brain\r\nis not known farther than the fact of their existence, we do not know\r\nhow they are fed, nor from where, so we are fully warranted in seeking a\r\nuse for both powers--magnetic and electric. One says the power of\r\nelectricity belongs more to the motor nerves and the magnetic to the\r\nnutrient system; if not they are happily blended and give the results.\r\nWithout such forces life and motion could not be sustained. As it is not\r\nmy object to write a treatise on general physiology, I will turn at once\r\nto the subject of the relation of life and health as affected by the\r\nabnormal supply and action of ear-wax.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: \"The secretion of the external auditory meatus, mixed with\r\nthe secretion of the neighboring glands or ceruminous glands, forms the\r\nwell known ear-wax or cerumen. The secretion in this place contains a\r\nreddish pigment of a bitterish sweet taste, the composition of which has\r\nnot been investigated.\" American Text-Book of Physiology.]\r\n\r\n\r\nUNAIDED INVESTIGATION.\r\n\r\nAs our investigations are without the assistance of ancient or modern\r\nwriters we will have to reason that man is a machine of form and power,\r\nforming its own parts and generating its own powers as it has use for\r\nthem. At this time we begin to reason thus, that all powers are\r\ninvisible and we see effect only. We know such forces to be abundant in\r\nnature, and life is sustained by them. To find the substances in the\r\nbody that causes them to act and how to act, has been the object of my\r\njourney as an explorer. If they give us health when normal action\r\nprevails and disease only when abnormal, then we are admonished to form\r\na more intimate acquaintance with the qualities, and with all the\r\nproducts, when formed in this great laboratory which compounds and\r\nqualifies each substance to fill its mission of force, construction,\r\npurity and action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE CHEST.\r\n\r\n     Where Confined--Consumption--Can Consumption Be Cured--Consumption\r\n     Described--No Time for Surrender--Cerebral Spinal Fluid--How to\r\n     Destroy Deadly Bombs of Decay--Battle of Blood for Life--Militis\r\n     Tuberculosis--Conversion of Bodies Into Gas--Forming a\r\n     Tubercle--Breeding Contagion--The Seeds of Disease--Generating\r\n     Fever--Whooping Cough--Clouds and Lungs Are Much Alike--The Wisdom\r\n     of Nature--Water Formed in Lungs--The Law of Fives--Feeble Action\r\n     of Heart--The Heart--From Neck to Heart--Dyspepsia or Imperfect\r\n     Digestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE CONFINED.\r\n\r\nDiseases of the chest are generally confined to heart, lungs, pleura,\r\nthe pericardium, mediastium, blood vessels, with nerves and lymphatics.\r\nAs we open the breast we behold the heart, a very large machine or\r\nengine, situated conveniently to throw blood to all parts of the body.\r\nTo it we see hose or pipes that go to each organ, all muscles, the\r\nstomach, bowels, liver, spleen, kidneys, bladder and womb, all bones,\r\nfibers, ligaments, membranes, and its body, lungs and brain. When we\r\nfollow this blood through its whole journey to feed the dependent parts,\r\nbe they organ or muscle, we find just enough unloaded at each station to\r\nsupply the demand as fast as consumed. Thus life is supplied at each\r\nstroke of the heart, which gives blood to keep digestion in full motion\r\nwhile other supplies of blood are being made and put in channels to\r\ncarry to the heart, blood is freely given to keep those channels strong,\r\nclean and active. Thus much depends on the heart, and great care should\r\nbe given to that study, because a healthy system depends almost wholly\r\non a normal heart and lung. Thus to study well the frame work of the\r\nchest should be with the greatest care. Every joint of the neck and\r\nspine has much to do with a healthy heart and lung, because all vital\r\nfluids from crown to sacrum do or have passed through heart and lungs,\r\nand any slip of bone, strain or bruise will affect to some degree the\r\nusefulness of that fluid in its vitality, when appropriated in the place\r\nor organ it should sustain in a good healthy state. To the Osteopath,\r\nhis first and last duty is to look well to a healthy blood and nerve\r\nsupply. He should let his eye camp day and night on the spinal column;\r\nto know if the bones articulate truly in all facets and other bearings,\r\nand never rest day or night until he knows the spine is true and in line\r\nfrom atlas to sacrum, with all ribs known to be in perfect union with\r\nprocesses of spine. In reasoning for probable causes of diseases of\r\nchest, we are met with the fact that the heart and lungs are housed up,\r\nand out of reach of the hand and eye. We hear a cough, see blood and\r\nother substances after they pass out of the lungs; we learn of general\r\nand local pain and misery, feel heat and cold on skin, note abnormal\r\nbreathing, but here we are at a stop, for want of facts. We know\r\nsomething is wrong, but cannot say what, until after death has done the\r\nwork, then we open the chest and find tubercles, cancers, ulcers and\r\nabcesses. How came they there? is the unanswered question. The servant\r\nof that breast who failed to keep his room clean, is the one to find and\r\npunish.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSUMPTION.\r\n\r\nI believe so much death by consumption will soon be with the things of\r\nthe past, if the cases are taken early and handled by a skilled\r\nmind,--one trained for that responsible place. He or she must be taught\r\nthis as a special branch. It is too deep for superficial knowledge or\r\nimperfect work. Life is in danger, and can be saved by skill, not by\r\nforce and ignorance. He who sees only the dollar in the lung, is not the\r\nman to trust with your case.\r\n\r\nIt is such men as have the ability to think, and the skill to comprehend\r\nand execute the application of nature's unerring laws, that obtain the\r\nresults required. We believe the day has come, and long before noon, the\r\nfear of consumption will greatly pass from the minds of people. We have\r\nlong since known and proven that a cough is only an effect. If an effect\r\nthen a wise man will set his mental dogs on the track, which is (effect)\r\nto hunt the skunk, (cause). He has all the evidence by the cough,\r\nlocation of pain, tenderness of spine, neck, and quality of the\r\nsubstances coughed up to locate the cause, and to know, when he has\r\nfound it, how to remove the cause, and give relief; will grow more\r\nsimple as he reasons and notes effect. We do not think this result will\r\nbe obtained every time by even an average mind, unless he has a special\r\ntraining for that purpose. He must not only know that the lungs are in\r\nthe upper part of the chest close to the heart, liver and stomach, but\r\nhe must know the relation all sustain to each other, that the blood must\r\nbe abundantly supplied, support and nourish three sets of nerves, namely\r\nsensory, motor and nutrient; also voluntary and involuntary. If the\r\nsupply should be diminished on the nutrient nerves, weakness would\r\nfollow; reduce the supply from the motor and it will have the same\r\neffect. Motion becomes too feeble to carry blood to and from lungs\r\nnormally, and the blood becomes diseased and congested, because it is\r\nnot passed on to other parts with the force necessary for health of\r\nlungs.\r\n\r\nAt this time the nerves of sensation become irritated by pressure and\r\nlack of nutriment, and we cough, which is an effort of nature to unload\r\nthe burden of oppression that congestion causes with sensory nerves. If\r\nthis be effect, then we must suffer and die, or remove the cause, put\r\nout the fire and stop waste of life, without which all is lost. Nature\r\nwill do its work of repairing in due time. Let us reason by comparison.\r\nIf we dislocate a shoulder, fever and heat will follow. The same is true\r\nof all limbs and joints of the body. If any obstructing blood or other\r\nfluid should be deposited in quantities great enough to stop other\r\nfluids from passing on their way, Nature will fire up its engine to\r\nremove such deposits by converting fluids into gas. As heat and motion\r\nhave much to do as remedies, we may expect fever and pain until nature's\r\nfurnace produces heat, forms and converts its fluids into gas and other\r\ndeposits, and passes them through the excretories to space, and allows\r\nthe body to work normally again.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW CONSUMPTION USUALLY BEGINS.\r\n\r\nWe believe consumption causes the death of thousands annually who might\r\nbe saved. We must not let stupidity veil our reason, and we are to blame\r\nif we let so many run into \"Consumption\" from a simple hard cough. The\r\nremedy is natural, and we believe from results already obtained 75 per\r\ncent can be cured if taken in time. What we generally call\r\n\"Consumption\" begins with a cough, chilly sensations, and lasts a day or\r\ntwo. Sometimes fever accompanies with cough, either high or low. The\r\ncold generally relaxes in a few days, lungs get \"loose,\" and much is\r\nraised and continues for a period, but the cough appears again and again\r\nwith all changes of weather, and lasts longer each time, until it\r\nbecomes permanent, then it is called \"Consumption,\" because of this\r\ncontinuance. Medicines are administered freely and often, but the lungs\r\ngrow worse, cough more continued and much harder, till finally blood\r\nbegins to come from lungs with wasting of strength. Change of climate is\r\nsuggested and taken, but with no change for the better; another and\r\nanother travels to death on the same line. Then the doctor in council\r\nreports \"hereditary consumption\" and with his decision all are\r\nsatisfied, and each member of the family feels that a cold and cough\r\nmeans a coffin, because the doctor says the family has \"hereditary\r\nconsumption.\" This shade tree has given comfort and contentment to the\r\ndoctors of the whole past.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAN CONSUMPTION BE CURED?\r\n\r\nIf you have a tiresome and weakening cough at the close of the winter,\r\nand wish to be cured, we would advise you to begin Osteopathic treatment\r\nat once, so the lungs can heal and harden against next winter's attack.\r\n\r\nThis is the first I have written on \"Consumption\" because I wanted to\r\ntest my conclusions by long and careful observations on cases that I\r\nhave taken and successfully treated. I kept the results from public\r\nprint until I could obtain positive proof that \"Consumption\" could be\r\ncured. So far the discovered causes give me little doubt, and the cures\r\nare a certainty in very many cases. An early beginning is one of the\r\ngreat considerations in incipient consumption.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSUMPTION DESCRIBED.\r\n\r\nFor fear you do not understand what I mean by \"Consumption\" I will write\r\non a descriptive line quite pointedly. I will give start and progress to\r\nfully developed consumption. We often meet with cases of permanent\r\ncough, with expectorations of long duration, dating back two, five, ten,\r\neven thirty years, to the time they had measles. The severity of the\r\ncough and strain had congested even the lung substances, and a chronic\r\ninflammation was the result. If we analyze the sputa we find fibrin and\r\neven lung muscle. Does all this array of dangerous symptoms cause an\r\nOsteopath to give up in despair? It should not, on the other hand he\r\nshould go deeper on the hunt of cause. He may find trouble in nerve\r\nfiber of pneumogastric nerve, atlas or hyoid, vertebra, rib, or\r\nclavicle, may be by pressing on some nerve that supplies mucous\r\nmembrane of air cells or passages. A cut foot will often produce\r\nlockjaw, why not a pressure on some center branch or nerve fiber cause\r\nsome division--nerve of the lungs that governs venous circulation which\r\nwould contract and hold blood indefinitely as an irritant, equal to\r\ncause, perpetual coughing?\r\n\r\n\r\nNO TIME FOR SURRENDER.\r\n\r\nThis is not the time for the brainy Osteopath to run up the white flag\r\nof defeat and surrender. Open the doors of your purest reason, put on\r\nthe belt of energy and unload the sinking vessel of life. Throw\r\noverboard all dead weights from fascia and wake up the forces of the\r\nexcretories. Let the nerves all show their powers to throw out every\r\nweight that would sink or reduce the vital energies of nature. Give them\r\na chance to work, give them the full nourishment and the victory will be\r\non the side of the intelligent engineer. Never surrender but die in the\r\nlast ditch.\r\n\r\nLet us enter the field of active exploration and note the causes that\r\nwould lead us to conclude we have the cause that produces \"consumption\"\r\nas it has ever been called.\r\n\r\nBegin at the brain, go down the ladder of observation, stop and whet\r\nyour knives of mental steel sharp, get your nerves quiet by the opium\r\nof patience. Begin with the atlas, follow with the search-light of\r\nquickened reason, comb back your hair of mental strength, and never\r\nleave that bone till you have learned how many nerves pass through and\r\naround that wisely formed first part of the neck. Remember it was\r\nplanned and builded by the mind and hand of the infinite. See what nerve\r\nfibers passes through and on to the base center, and each minute cell,\r\nfascia, gland and blood vessel of the lungs. Do you not know that each\r\nnerve fiber to its place is king and lord of all?\r\n\r\n\r\nCEREBRAL SPINAL FLUID.\r\n\r\nI think consumption begins by closing the channels of cerebro-spinal\r\nfluid in neck, which fluid stands as one of, if not the most highly\r\nrefined elements in animal bodies. Its fineness would indicate that it\r\nis a substance that must be delivered in full supply continually to keep\r\nhealth normal; if so, we will for experimental reasons look at the neck\r\nligated, as found in measles, croup, colds and eruptive fevers. Supply\r\nis stopped from passing below atlas for three days. During such diseases\r\nfever runs high at this time and dries up the albumen, giving cause for\r\ntubercles to begin, as fever has dried out the water and left the\r\nalbumen in small deposits in the lungs, liver, kidneys and bowels. If\r\nthis view of the great uses of brain fluid is true as cause of\r\nglandular growths and other dead deposits; have we not a cause for\r\nmilitis tuberculosis? Have we not encouragement to prosecute with\r\ninterest, in the hope of an answer to the question, \"What is\r\ntuberculosis?\" Our writers are just as much at sea to-day as a thousand\r\nyears ago. I will give the reader some of the reasons why I think the\r\nmischief was started while fluid was cut off by congestion of neck. How\r\ncan the fluid be cut off at neck is a very natural question. By the\r\ncrudest method of reasoning we would conclude that from the form of the\r\nneck, many objects are indicated, and the material of which it is\r\ncomposed would give reason to turn all its powers of thought, to ask why\r\nit is so formed, as to twist, bend, straighten, stiffen and relax at\r\nwill, to suit so many purposes? A very tough skin--a sheathe--surrounds\r\nthe neck with blood vessels, nerves, muscles, bones, ligaments, fascia,\r\nglands great and small, throat and trachea. In bones we find a great\r\ncanal for spinal cord. It is well and powerfully protected by a strong\r\nwall of bone, so no outer pressure can obstruct the flow of passing\r\nfluids, to keep vitality supplied by brain forces, but with all the\r\nguards given to protect the cord, we find that it can be overcome by\r\nimpact fluids to such degree as to stop blood and other fluids from\r\nsupplying lungs and all below.\r\n\r\nThe fluid we speak of comes from the skull, and when in process of\r\nformation must not be disturbed until it has passed through all chances\r\nof being injured by force, air or light. Thus the great need of walls to\r\nhold the enemy outside the safety line. Such truths surely should\r\nattract our attention when we explore for causes. We can analyze\r\nmaterial bodies but we have to stop at the life line for more knowledge.\r\nOur boats have been in port over 6000 years, waiting for knowledge about\r\nthe whats and whys of life, until barnacles of ignorance have\r\naccumulated to such thickness that the conchologist has called that cake\r\nof shells \"allopathy\" which weighed anchor and turned to the great sea\r\nof human credulity to expound, with nothing but conjectures to offer. He\r\ntoots his fog-horn in all lands and on all seas, and says, \"age before\r\nreason.\" Thus one generation blindly follows another.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO DESTROY DEADLY BOMBS OF DECAY.\r\n\r\nI think by this time the reader has gotten his mind in line with his\r\nexploring needle of thought to get some light or knowledge of why a\r\ngrowth and how a body that has never failed for few or many years,\r\nbegins and continues to form and plant deadly bombs of decay in that\r\nonce powerful engine of perfect health, to produce suicide. We see and\r\nknow this to be the case in thousands of beings annually, and this same\r\nquestion is just as applicable to the herds of animals as to man. Thus\r\nwe cry piteously for help, but no answer has come in past days; we go on\r\nand give place in lungs and other parts of the deadly tubercle. But one\r\nanswer can be given in \"Holy Writ\" to suit these questions, \"Cleanliness\r\nis next to Godliness.\" Turn the waters of life loose at the brain,\r\nremove all hindrances and the work will be done, and give us the eternal\r\nlegacy, LONGEVITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF BLOOD FOR LIFE.\r\n\r\nIn America from the day of Washington and all centuries before his time,\r\nman has dreaded diseases of the lungs more universally than any other\r\none disease. If we compare pulmonary diseases with other maladies we\r\nfind more persons die of consumption, pneumonia, bronchitis and nervous\r\ncoughs than from smallpox, typhus and bilious fever and all other fevers\r\ncombined. Many diseases of contagious natures do not stay in city, town,\r\ncountry nor an army, but a short time; kills a few and disappears and\r\nmay not return for many years. The same is the history of yellow fever,\r\ncholera and other epidemics. They slay their hundreds and stop as\r\nunceremoniously as they began. But when we think of diseases that begin\r\nto show their effects in tonsils, trachea and lining membranes of the\r\nair passages, we find we are in a boundless ocean; because we find all\r\nseasons of the year, which afford changes of weather: Wet, dry, windy,\r\nhot and cold, which mark 30° to 60° in twenty-four hours, chills the\r\nlungs and whole system, closes the excretory system against renovating\r\nequal to deposits, with all other chances to throw out dead matter and\r\ngases that destroy blood and life in proportion to the amount and time\r\nof abnormal retention.\r\n\r\nIt takes no great mind to know from past observation that a common cold\r\noften holds on and settles down to chronic inflammation of the lungs,\r\nand the patient dies of consumption, croup, diphtheria, tonsilitis, and\r\nas catarrhal trouble stays and begins to waste vitality by failing to\r\noxygenize blood while in the lungs, diphtheria paves the way for the\r\nyoung and old to die of consumption. Dance halls, opera houses,\r\nchurches, school houses, and all crowded assemblies never fail to\r\ninspect and deposit the seeds of consumption in weak lungs.\r\n\r\nAs one delves deeper and deeper into the machinery and exacting laws of\r\nlife, he beholds works and workings of contented laborers of all parts\r\nof the one common whole--the great shafts and pillars of an engine\r\nworking to the fullness of the meaning of perfection. He sees that great\r\nquarter-master the heart, pouring in and loading train after train and\r\ngiving orders to the wagon-master to line his teams and march on quick\r\ntime to all divisions, supply all companies, squads and sections with\r\nrations, clothing, ammunition, surgeons, splints and bandages, and put\r\nall the dead and wounded into the ambulances to be repaired or buried\r\nwith military honors by Captain \"VEIN,\" who fearlessly penetrates the\r\ndensest bones, muscles and glands, with the living waters to quench the\r\nthirst of the blue corpuscles, who are worn out by doing fatigue duty in\r\nthe great combat between life and death. He often has to run his trains\r\non forced marches to get supplies to sustain his men of life when they\r\nhave had to contend with long sieges of heat and cold. Of all officers\r\nof life, none have greater duties to perform than the quarter-master of\r\nblood supply, who borrows the force with which he runs his deliveries\r\nfrom the brain which give motion to all parts of active life.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILITIS TUBERCULOSIS.\r\n\r\nA tubercle is a separate body being enveloped.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Chambers.]\r\n\r\nAs all descriptions of a tubercle in books amount to about this, that\r\nthe tubercle is an amount of fleshy substance which may be albumen,\r\nfibrin, or any other substance collected and deposited at one place in\r\nthe human body, and covered with a film composed generally of fibrinous\r\nsubstances, and deposited in its spherical form, and separated from all\r\nsimilarly formed spheres by fascia. They may be very numerous, for many\r\nhundreds may occupy one cubic inch and yet one is distinct from all\r\nothers. They seem to develop only where fascia is abundant; in the\r\nlungs, liver, bowels and skin. After formation they may exist and show\r\nnothing but roughened surfaces, and when the period of dissolution and\r\nthe solvent powers of the chemical laboratory take possession to banish\r\nthem from the system, it generally begins its labors at such time as\r\nsome catarrhal disease is preying upon the human system. Nature seems to\r\nmake its first effort for the purpose of disposing of such substances as\r\nhave accumulated at the catarrhal period. At which time it brings\r\nforward all the solvent qualities and applies them with the assistance\r\nof the motor force to drive out through the bowels, lungs, porous and\r\nexcretory system all irritable substances. Electricity is called in as\r\nthe motor force to be used in expelling all unkindly substances. By this\r\neffort of nature, which is an increased action of the motor nerves,\r\nelectricity is brought to the degree of heat usually called fever, which\r\nif better understood we would possibly find to be the necessary heat of\r\nthe furnace of the body being used to convert dead substances into gas\r\nwhich can travel through the excretory system and be thrown from the\r\nbody much easier than water, lymph, albumen or fibrin.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONVERSION OF BODIES INTO GAS.\r\n\r\nDuring this process of gas burning, a very high temperature is obtained\r\nby the increased action of the arterial system through the motor nerves,\r\npermeating those tubercles and causing an inflammation of them by the\r\ngaseous disturbance so produced; another effort of nature to convert\r\nthose tubercles into gas and relieve the body of their presence and\r\nirritable occupancy.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration we will ask the reader if it would be reasonable to\r\nexpect to pass a common towel through a pipe stem. Nevertheless nature\r\ncan easily do it. Confine the towel in a cylinder and apply fire, which\r\nin time will convert the towel into gas or smoke, and enable it to pass\r\nthrough the stem. Is it not just as reasonable to suppose those high\r\ntemperatures of the body are nature's furnaces, making fires out of\r\nthose dead bodies, while passing them through the skin in order to get\r\nrid of these great and small towels which are packed all through the\r\nhuman fascia, and can only be passed from the body in a gaseous form;\r\nthe gas generated by heat.\r\n\r\nThe blackened eye of the pugilist soon fires up its furnaces and\r\nproceeds to generate gas from the dead blood that surrounds the eye.\r\nThough it may be considerable quantities under the skin, the blood soon\r\ndisappears leaving the face and eye normal to all appearances. No pus\r\nhas formed, nor deposit left, fever disappears, the eye is well. What\r\nbetter effort could nature offer than through its gas generating\r\nfurnace. I will leave any other method for you to discover. I know of\r\nnone that my reason can grasp.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMING A TUBERCLE.\r\n\r\nWhen reason sees a white corpuscle in the fascia not taken up as a\r\nnutrient, it attaches itself to the fascia with all its uterine powers\r\nduring the time of measles or other eruptive diseases, and soon takes\r\nform and is a vital and durable being whose name is tubercle; in form a\r\nsphere, and place of foetal life is a cell in the fascia of life\r\ngiving power to all forms of flesh. Thus all tubercles are\r\nunappropriated substances whom mother fascia has clothed and ordered in\r\ncamp for treatment and repairs, and placed them on the list of enrolled\r\npensioners, to draw on the treasury of the fascia, until death shall\r\ndischarge them.\r\n\r\n\r\nBREEDING CONTAGION.\r\n\r\nThe mothers of the human race give birth to children from puberty to\r\nsterility. She may give birth a dozen times, but nature finally calls a\r\nhalt, and the whole system of life sustaining nerves of the womb which\r\nare in the fascia, with blood in great abundance to supply foetal\r\nlife, ceases to go farther with the processes of building beings.\r\nVitality for that purpose stops, never to return. Nature has no longer a\r\ndemand for her system to act as a constructing cause for other beings,\r\nof her kind, and she is free the remainder of her days.\r\n\r\nA question arises. Are children all she can develop in her system and\r\ngive birth to? No, she can go through other processes of breeding. In\r\nher fascia there is one seed, if vitalized will develop a being called\r\nmeasles. She never has but one confinement. That set of nerves that gave\r\nsupport and growth to measles died in the delivery of the child, and\r\nnever can conceive and produce any more measles. Another seed lives in\r\nher fascia waiting to be vitalized by the male principle of smallpox,\r\nand when it is born it always kills the nerves that gave it life and\r\nform. And the person never can have but one such child or being during\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nStill another seed awaits the coming of the commissary to nourish while\r\nit consumes that vitality in the fascia of the glands to develop the\r\nportly child we call mumps. Both male and female conceive and give birth\r\nto such beings, then tear up the tracks and roads behind them, by\r\nkilling the demand for such drink.\r\n\r\nI want to draw the mind of the reader to the fact that no being can be\r\nformed without material. A place in which to be developed, and all\r\nforces necessary to do the needed work. And as all excressences and\r\nabnormal growths, diseases and conditions, must have the friendly\r\nassistance of the fascia before development; the fascia is the place to\r\nlook for cause of disease and the place to consult and begin the action\r\nof remedies in all diseases, even though it be the birth of a child.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEEDS OF DISEASE.\r\n\r\nWe can arrive at truth only by the powerful rules of reason, so the\r\nphilosopher has shouted from the house tops of all ages. He adjusts his\r\nmany supposable causes, adds to and subtracts until he arrives at a\r\nconclusion based upon the facts of his observations. Knowing the\r\nprinciples that exist in substances and seeds, by which when associated\r\nwith proper conditions that powerful engine known as animal life gives\r\nthe truth with fact and motion as its voucher. We reason, if corn be\r\nplanted in moist and warm earth, that action and growth will present the\r\nform of a living stalk of corn, which has existed in embryo, and still\r\ncontinues its vital actions as long as the proper conditions prevail, i.\r\ne., until the growth and development is completed. If you take a seed\r\nin your fingers, push it in the ground and cover it up, incubation,\r\ngrowth and development is expected in obedience to the law under which\r\nit serves. Thus we see to succeed we must deposit and cover up the seed\r\nin order that the laws of gestation may have an opportunity by which\r\nthey get the results desired. As nature always presents itself to our\r\nminds as seeds deposited in soil and season to suit, and it is loyal to\r\nits own laws only, we are constrained by this method of reasoning to\r\nconclude that disease must have a soil in which to plant its seeds\r\nbefore gestation and development. It must have seasonable conditions,\r\nthe rains of nourishment, also the necessary time required for such\r\nprocesses. All these laws must be fulfilled to the letter, otherwise a\r\nfailure is absolute. As the great laboratory of nature is always at work\r\nin the human body, the chilling winds and poisonous breaths, with\r\nextremes of heat and cold at different seasons of the year by day and\r\nnight, and the lungs and skin are continually secreting and excreting\r\nevery minute, hour and day of our lives, is it not reasonable to suppose\r\nthat we inhale many elements that are floating in the common winds that\r\ncontain the seeds of some destructive element, to the harmony of fluids\r\nthat are necessary to sustain the healthy animal forms.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERATING FEVER.\r\n\r\nSuppose it should start the yeast, or kind of substance that lives\r\ngreatly upon lime. If this yeast in its action and thirst for food to\r\nsuit its life and appetite should call in from the earth, water and\r\natmosphere for its daily food lime substances only, and by its power\r\ndestroy all other principles taken as nourishment, is it not reasonable\r\nto suppose it would deposit such elements in over powering quantities in\r\nthe fascia of the mucous membrane of the lungs in such quantities, as to\r\novercome the renovating powers of the lungs and excretory system, by its\r\nparalyzing quantities of diseased fluids, all through the universal\r\nfascia of animal life. This deposit acts as an irritant to the sensory\r\nnerves to such an extent that the electricity of the motor nerves is\r\nforced to take charge of, and run the machinery of the human body, with\r\nsuch velocity as to raise the temperature of the body, by putting the\r\nelectricity above the normal action of animal life, and thereby generate\r\nthat temperature known as fever?\r\n\r\nThe two extremes, heat and cold, may be the causes of retention and\r\ndetention. One is detained by the contraction of cold until the blood\r\nand other fluids die by asphyxia. The warm temperature produces\r\nrelaxation of the nerves, blood, and all other vessels of the fascia,\r\nduring which time the arteries are injecting too great quantities of\r\nfluids to be renovated by the excretory systems. Thus you have a cause\r\nfor decomposition of the blood and other substances, to be conveyed to\r\nthe lungs for purification and renewal. You have a logical foundation\r\nand a cause for all diseases, catarrhal, climatic, contagions,\r\ninfections, and epidemics. The fascia proves itself to be the probable\r\nmatrix of life and death. Beginning with the mucous membrane penetrating\r\nall parts to supply and renovate the fluids of life, and nourishing all\r\nthe nerves of nutrition and assimilation. When harmonious in normal\r\naction, health is good; when perverted, disease is destructive unto\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHOOPING COUGH.\r\n\r\nI have perused all the authority obtainable, advised with and counciled\r\nfor information in reference to the cause of whooping cough until I am\r\nconstrained to think, whether I say so or not, that I have had many\r\nadditions of words during the conversation, and to use a homely phrase,\r\nless sense than I started out with. My tongue is tired, my brain\r\nexhausted, my hopes disappointed and my mind disgusted, that after so\r\nmuch effort to obtain some positive knowledge of the disease in\r\nquestion, which is whooping cough, that I have received nothing that\r\nwould give me any light whatever pertaining to the subject. It winds up\r\nthus, that it may be a germ that irritates the pneumogastric nerve. I go\r\noff as blank and empty as the fish lakes on the moon. I supposed writers\r\nwould say something in reference to the irritating influence of this\r\ndisease on the nerves and muscles that would contract or convulsively\r\nshorten the muscles that attach at the one end to the os hyoid, and at\r\nthe other end at various points along the neck, and force the hyoid back\r\nagainst the pneumogastric nerve, hypoglossal, cervical, or some other\r\nnerve that would be irritated by such pressure on nerves by the os\r\nhyoid, when pulled back and held against such nerves. The above picture\r\nwill give the reader some idea why I became so thoroughly disgusted with\r\nthe heaps of compiled trash. I say trash because there was not a single\r\ntruth, great or small, to guide me in search of the desired knowledge.\r\nAnd at this point I will say on my first exploration I found all of the\r\nnerves and muscles that attach to the os hyoid at any point contracted,\r\nshortened and pulling the hyoid back to and pressing against the\r\npneumogastric nerve, and all the nerves in that vicinity. Also each and\r\nevery muscle was in a hard and contracted condition in the region of\r\nthis portion of the trachea, and extended up and into the back part of\r\nthe tongue. Then I satisfied myself that this irritable condition of the\r\nmuscles was possibly the cause of the spasms of the trachea during the\r\nconvulsive cough. I proceeded at once with my hand guided by my judgment\r\nto suspend or stop for awhile the action of the nerves of sensation that\r\ngo with and control the muscles of the machinery which conducts air to\r\nand from the lungs. That my first effort while acting upon this\r\nphilosophy was a complete relaxation of all muscles and fibers of that\r\npart of the neck, and when they relaxed their hold upon the respiratory\r\nmachinery the breathing became normal. I have been asked what bone I\r\nwould pull when treating whooping cough? My answer would be, the bones\r\nthat held by attachment the muscles of the hyoid system in such\r\nirritable condition that begin with the atlas and terminate with the\r\nsacrum. To him who has been a willing student of the American School of\r\nOsteopathy the successful management of whooping cough should be\r\nabsolute, reliable and successful in all cases, when taken for treatment\r\nin anything like, a reasonable time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOUDS AND LUNGS ARE MUCH ALIKE.\r\n\r\nOne is always the same in form and stays in the body of animals, while\r\nthe clouds, the lungs of the sky, are never the same in form. They are\r\nsometimes very dense and separated from all others. Such are more\r\nfurious in display. Then we see the softer clouds which cover all\r\nvisible space above; they too give us rain but in a more quiet way and\r\nare more extended in space; they shade the sun, and form water by\r\nuniting oxygen and hydrogen, and supply vegetation and all demands for\r\nwater. Now we see and know the uses for the clouds or lungs of the sky,\r\nand we are led to hunt and locate the water forming clouds of the animal\r\nbeings. As we behold above us the forming clouds we see great activity,\r\nwith darkness and attending shadows, without such shadows or darkness no\r\nrain can form.\r\n\r\nThe lung of man, too, is in the shade, and surely like the clouds have\r\nmuch to do with the air which contains both gases, which compose water\r\nand other elements of life. With my power of reasoning, if the lungs do\r\nnot generate water and supply the human system through the secretions to\r\nsustain life, and keep the body clean and healthy by the excretories, I\r\nam at a loss to know why so much wind is taken into the body just to\r\nblow out. One would say we live by the wind, and to cut it off we die.\r\nAt this point I will ask the question, Where and how do fishes get their\r\nwind? If they can live on oxygen and hydrogen when united in the form of\r\nwater, is not this the strongest conclusion we can come to that the\r\nlungs generate water of a purer quality than is found in the running\r\nbrooks or ocean?\r\n\r\nIs it not reasonable to suppose that in the lungs can be found the\r\nfountain from which water is conveyed to the lymphatics and other parts\r\nof the body, to mix with the blood and keep it in proper condition while\r\nin construction and processes of renovation? Then if this be true, have\r\nwe not established and located the fountain head and supply of the\r\nnutrient waters of life? If so are we not justified in going to that\r\nfountain for water to extinguish a fire that is consuming the body,\r\nwhich we call fever? This heat never appears until the water supplying\r\nthe lymphatics is very much exhausted, previous to this exhibition of\r\nheat; which the chemist would conclude was the result of the action of\r\nphosphorous uniting with oxygen without hydrogen.\r\n\r\nWe as philosophical machinists, to extinguish this fire by every method\r\nof reason, would be forced to go to the lungs, and place them in a\r\ncondition that they can generate water at once and supply the excretory\r\nducts, which will at the first pulsation of the heart throw water upon\r\nthe consuming fire, and extinguish it by uniting oxygen with hydrogen,\r\nand cover the burning building with water by disabling the power of\r\nphosphorous and oxygen from uniting and keeping up the flames of\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WISDOM OF NATURE.\r\n\r\nFor all my life previous to the day I spoke out with my conclusions of\r\nthe wisdom of nature as a very wise and careful mechanic, I had been\r\ntold that \"God\" was wise to a finish,--from my birth until I was\r\nthirty-five years old,--when I saw that all work done by that law of\r\npower and wisdom was absolutely perfect in all its requirements. In\r\nvegetable life no power of human can detect a flaw or even suggest an\r\nadditional leaf, limb or fruit. I had made a long study of minerology in\r\nwhich I found each stone or mettle was in a division of life that was\r\nits own, and no other stone could appear dressed in its garb, from the\r\nblack silurian to the purely transparent crystal. I saw that a diamond\r\ncould not be a ruby, neither could it be an oak, a goose nor a goat.\r\nWith all the teaching which had given God credit for his perfect\r\nconstruction, wisdom and ability in all nature, I reasoned that in\r\nparching seasons that the sun's fires were put out, and a feverish earth\r\ncooled by the falling dews of the clouds. I asked of my own reason if\r\nthere was not a cloud of water in the human body that could be caused to\r\ndrop its dews, put out the fires of fever, and save the forests of life\r\nthat were being burned every fall season.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER FORMED IN LUNGS.\r\n\r\nI reasoned that water was made by the union of two gases, hydrogen and\r\noxygen,--then a question arose, Is it not fully in line with reason that\r\nunion of the two gases can and does occur in the lungs and form water,\r\nthat is taken up by the secretions carried to the lymphatics, and by\r\nthem to all of the system and stored away for use? Thus I reasoned, and\r\nproceeded to seek nerve centers to cause the lymphatics to discharge\r\nthis water on such places and in quantities sufficient to reduce the\r\nheat called fever. I succeeded, fevers vanished as with a magic touch,\r\nand left the persons, both old and young, in their normal temperatures\r\nwithout any difference as to kinds of fever to the complete list.\r\n\r\nOur lungs are surely the half-way place between life and death. We are\r\ntold by chemistry that two gases make water for the uses of the body. Is\r\nit not true that nature makes water in great quantities often for\r\nspecial cases or conditions, for relief purposes, such as in asiatic\r\ncholera, cholera morbus, chills and fever; when the contents of stomach,\r\nbowels and skin run off many gallons of water, running through sheet and\r\nmattress and on floor, not from kidneys but skin. Is it not plain to the\r\nman of reason that the two gases, oxygen and hydrogen, do unite in the\r\nlungs, form water and give supply to this great river of water that\r\nwashes life out in but a few hours in cases of cholera and other\r\ndiseases. The person is very cold at such times, breath and lung far\r\nbelow the normal, and fully enough to condense gases to water.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAW OF FIVES.\r\n\r\nLungs have five lobes, three on right lung, and two on left. Liver has\r\nfive lobes, three on right lobe, and two on left lobe. Nerves have five\r\nqualities, nutrition, sensation, motion, voluntary and involuntary.\r\nNerves have five senses, seeing, hearing, feeling, smelling and tasting.\r\nSince all principles differ in qualities or kinds of service, would it\r\nbe amiss for us to inquire a little farther why the lungs and liver are\r\nprovided with five divisions each, if not to do five kinds of work, and\r\ndifferent from all other kinds in many ways?\r\n\r\n\r\nFEEBLE ACTION OF HEART.\r\n\r\nI want to draw your attention to the facts that there is no method known\r\nby which electricity or magnetic forces can be weighed. When we find the\r\nnerves that connect the heart and lungs to brain limited by pressure\r\nfrom twist or slip of neck, do we not see cause for croup? How would we\r\nreason to convey electricity without a connected wire? Not at all, we\r\nwould know no electric force could reach to any point unless a continued\r\nconnection was made. Now to the point; suppose the vagus nerve should be\r\noppressed to a condition to cut off part of the electricity, would we be\r\nsurprised if the heart should be feeble in action. I think much of the\r\ndiseases of the \"_heart_\" are not of the organ but from a feeble supply\r\nof electricity that is cut off in medulla or heart nerves, between heart\r\nand brain. Why singing and roaring of ears in heart diseases, if there\r\nis no waste of pectoral electricity?\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HEART.\r\n\r\nWith the knife of reason in hand and the microscope of mind of the\r\ngreatest known power properly adjusted, we cut and lay open the breast\r\nof man. Here we dwell indefinitely. This is the engine of life, the\r\nself-propelling machine which has constructed all that is necessary to\r\nits own convenience and comfort. It has brought and deposited its own\r\nnourishment in the coronary arteries, whose duty is to construct and\r\nenlarge the heart from time to time as its demands increase. We see its\r\nmain trunk of supply placed lengthways with the spinal column for the\r\npurpose of constructing a manufactory of nutriment. We pass from the\r\nheart upward about one foot, here we find it has constructed a battery\r\nof force and sensation, and contains all power necessary to carry on\r\nconstruction to the completed man.\r\n\r\nIn that brain or battery is found all the motor and sensory elements of\r\nlife, with nerves to transmit all nerve powers and principles found in\r\nthe human body. There is not a known atom in the whole human make-up\r\nthat has not been propelled by the heart through the channels by which\r\nit has provided for such purpose. Every muscle, bone, hair, and all\r\nother parts without an exception have traveled through this system of\r\narteries to their separate destinations. All are indebted to the heart\r\nfor their material size, and all qualities of motion and life sustaining\r\nprinciples of the human body.\r\n\r\nIf the carotid artery should tire out and not be able to perform its\r\nduty the brain would tire out also, and cease to operate. Should the\r\ndescending aorta come to a halt from any cause, all parts of the body\r\ndepending upon that vessel would suffer a total loss of blood supply.\r\nEqually so with any other principal artery of limb or body, all mark a\r\nfailure equal to the suspended supply. The parts and principles of the\r\nhuman body depending upon the heart are numerous beyond computation.\r\nEvery expulsive stroke of the heart throws into line armed and equipped\r\nfor duty thousands and millions of operators, whose duties are to\r\ninspect, repair injuries and construct anew if need be from the crown of\r\nthe head to the sole of the foot. With the best eye of reason we see but\r\ndimly into the breast of man which contains the heart, the wonder of man\r\nand the secret of life.\r\n\r\nI have given these bulky descriptions of the forest and ocean to\r\nprepare the mind of man to begin the inspection of the machinery that\r\nhas constructed the body of which he is the indweller. If we cannot\r\nswallow all, we can taste.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM NECK TO HEART.\r\n\r\nThe hearts of all animals should call the most careful attention of the\r\nstudent of nature. He finds in it the first act of life; from it go all\r\nparts or by it all parts of the body are made, and the student of nature\r\nsoon learns that at the heart he finds the first evidence of the power\r\nof life to continue and give useful shape to matter. Its first work is\r\nto complete itself in material form with necessary chambers to hold\r\nblood and with tubes to convey to all places of need. He sees vessels\r\nleaving the heart to form brain, lungs, liver, trunk and limbs, and with\r\neach and all he can see the nerves of motion, sensation, nutrition, the\r\nvoluntary and involuntary--all working in perfect harmony and content to\r\ndo their part in the economy of life. Without that union in action a\r\nconfusion will show in form of abnormality which is known as disease. On\r\nits work all nerves do depend for force and strength to build and\r\nrenovate the body in all its bones, muscles and nerves--thus all\r\nchannels to and from the heart must be cleared from all hindrance. No\r\nnerve can do its part unless it be well nourished. If not it will fail\r\nto execute its part for want of power--for by it all blood must move.\r\nThese nerves are found in plexuses in all parts of the body; they are\r\nabundant in the skin, fascia, muscle, lymphatics and all organs great\r\nand small. The Osteopath must know or learn that no infringement can be\r\ntolerated in any part. Nature's demands are surely absolute, and require\r\nthat the last farthing shall be paid in full. Now for a start--we will\r\nexplore the neck; here we have the great and small occipital and the\r\ncervical group all receiving from the brain and feeding parts below.\r\nThus we must stop at the neck and read the lessons that can be found\r\nthere, and learn them well; or we will find that we will not be able to\r\nmeet diseases only to be defeated. We must have the fight during the\r\nfour seasons of the year. In the cold seasons we will find lung and\r\nother diseases--croup, pneumonia, diphtheria, sore throat. All these do\r\ntheir mischief through the nerves of the neck.\r\n\r\nWhere is or who is the great thinker who knows and can tell all of the\r\nduties and actions of the nerves of the neck, or what nerve failed and\r\nslept while a tubercle was formed in the lungs? Which nerve slept while\r\nfat is heaped up in useless piles in the body? Let us wake up!\r\nConsumption does not come without a cause. What plexus is overcome and\r\nallows the lungs to waste away? To what ganglion of the spine would the\r\nfinger of reason point, and say, \"that is the cause of _phthisis\r\npulmonalis_?\" In our search we find a division of nerves run from the\r\nbrain through the regions of the neck, and find a point at which a\r\nbranch leaves a greater nerve on a line that leads to the lungs. We will\r\nlikely find a ganglion at which place all or much of one or both lungs\r\nare supplied. Then we, by reason, would see that freedom of action\r\ncannot be. If some substance should intrude by pressure on any nerve in\r\nthat region, we must judge by conditions if that pressure has cut off\r\nnutrition equal to feeble condition of the lungs.\r\n\r\n\r\nDYSPEPSIA OR IMPERFECT DIGESTION.\r\n\r\nIn our physiologies we read much about digestion. We will start in where\r\nthey stop. They bring us to the lungs with chyle fresh as made and\r\nplaced in thoracic duct, previous to flowing into the heart to be\r\ntransferred to lungs to be purified, charged with oxygen and otherwise\r\nqualified, and sent off for duty, through the arteries great and small,\r\nto the various parts of the system. But there is nothing said of the\r\ntime when all blood is gas (if ever) before it is taken up by the\r\nsecretions, after refinement, and driven to the lungs to be mixed with\r\nthe old blood from the venous system. A few questions about the blood\r\nseem to hang around my mental crib for food. Reason says we cannot use\r\nblood before it has all passed through the gaseous stage of refinement,\r\nwhich reduces all material to the lowest forms of atoms, before\r\nconstructing any material body. I think it safe to assume that all\r\nmuscles and bones of our body have been in the gas state while in the\r\nprocess of preparing substances for blood. A world of questions arise at\r\nthis point.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS OF GAS.\r\n\r\nThe first is, Where and how is food made into gas while in the body? If\r\nyou will listen to a dyspeptic after eating you will wonder where he\r\ngets all the wind that he rifts from his stomach, and continues for one\r\nor two hours after each meal. That gas is generated in the stomach and\r\nintestines, and we are led to believe so because we know of no other\r\nplace in which it can be made and thrown into the stomach by any tubes\r\nor other methods of entry. Thus by the evidence so far the stomach and\r\nbowels are the one place in which this gas is generated. Now comes\r\nquestion two: As I have spoken of the stomach that generates and ejects\r\ngreat quantities of gas for a longer or shorter time after meals, this\r\nclass of people have always been called dyspeptics. Another class of the\r\nsame race of beings stand side by side with him, without this gas\r\ngenerating. He, too, eats and drinks of the same kind of food, without\r\nany of the manifestations that have been described in the first class.\r\nWhy does one stomach blow off gas continually, while the other does not?\r\nis a very deep, serious and interesting question. As number two throws\r\noff no gas from the stomach after eating, is this conclusive evidence\r\nthat his stomach generates no gas? Or does his stomach and bowels form\r\ngas just as fast as No. 1? and the secretions of the stomach and bowels\r\ntake up and retain the nutritious matter and pass the remainder of the\r\ngas by way of the excretory ducts through the skin? If the excretory\r\nducts take up and carry this gas out of the body by way of the skin, and\r\nhe is a healthy man, why not account for No. one's stomach ejecting this\r\ngas by way of the mouth, because of the fact that the secretions of the\r\nstomach are either clogged up or inactive, for want of vital motion of\r\nthe nerve terminals of the stomach. Another question in connection with\r\nthis subject: Why is the man whose stomach belches forth gas in such\r\nabundance also suffering with cold feet, hands and all over the body,\r\nwhile No. 2 is quite warm and comfortable, with a glow of warmth passing\r\nfrom his body all the time? With these hints I will ask the question:\r\nWhat is digestion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE LYMPHATICS.\r\n\r\n     Importance of the Subject--Demands of Nature on the\r\n     Lymphatics--Dunglinson's Definition--Dangers of Dead\r\n     Substances--Lymph Continued--Solvent in Nature--Where Are the\r\n     Lymphatics Situated?--The Fat and Lean.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANCE OF THE SUBJECT.\r\n\r\nPossibly less is known of the lymphatics than any other division of the\r\nlife-sustaining machinery of man. Thus ignorance of that division is\r\nequal to a total blank with the operator. Finer nerves dwell with the\r\nlymphatics than even with the eye. The eye is an organized effect, the\r\nlymphatics the cause; in them the spirit of life more abundantly dwells.\r\nNo atom can leave the lymphatics in an imperfect state and get a union\r\nwith any part of the body. There the atom obtains form and knowledge of\r\nhow and what to do. The lymphatics consume more of the finer fluids of\r\nthe brain than the whole viscera combined. By nature, coarser substances\r\nare necessary to construct the organs that run the blast, and rough\r\nforging divisions. The lymphatics form, finish, temper and send the\r\nbricks to the builder with intelligence, that he may construct by\r\nadjusting all according to nature's plans and specifications. Nature\r\nmakes machinery that can produce just what is necessary, and when\r\nunited, produces what the most capable minds could exact.\r\n\r\nThe lymphatics are closely and universally connected with the spinal\r\ncord and all other nerves, long or short, universal or separate, and all\r\ndrink from the waters of the brain. By an action of the nerves of the\r\nlymphatics, a union of qualities necessary to produce gall, sugar,\r\nacids, alkalies, bone, muscle and softer parts, with the thought that\r\nelements can be changed, suspended, collected and associated and produce\r\nany chemical compound necessary to sustain animal life, wash out, salt,\r\nsweeten and preserve the being from decay and death by chemical,\r\nelectric, atmospheric or climatic conditions. By this we are admonished\r\nin all our treatment not to wound the lymphatics, as they are\r\nundoubtedly the life giving centers and organs. Thus it behooves us to\r\nhandle them with wisdom and tenderness, for by and from them a withered\r\nlimb, organ or any division of the body receives what we call\r\nreconstruction, or is builded anew, and without this cautious procedure\r\nyour patient had better save his life and money by passing you by as a\r\nfailure, until you are by knowledge qualified to deal with the\r\nlymphatics.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEMANDS OF NATURE ON THE LYMPHATICS.\r\n\r\nWhy not reason on the broad plain of known facts, and give the why he or\r\nshe has complete prostration. When all systems are cut off from a chance\r\nto move and execute such duties as nature has allotted to them, motor\r\nnerves must drive all substances to and sensation must judge the supply\r\nand demand. Nutrition must be in action the time and keep all parts well\r\nsupplied with power to labor or a failure is sure to appear. We must\r\never remember the demands of nature on the lymphatics, liver and\r\nkidneys. They must work all the time or a confusion for lack in their\r\nduties will mark a cripple in some function of life over which they\r\npreside.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUNGLINSON'S DEFINITION.\r\n\r\nDunglinson's scientific definition of the lymphatics is very extensive,\r\ncomprehensive and right to the point for our use as doctors of\r\nOsteopathy. He describes the lymphatic glands as countless in number,\r\nuniversally distributed all through the human body, containing vitalized\r\nwater and other fluids necessary to the support of animal life, running\r\nparallel with the venous system, and more abundantly there than in other\r\nlocations of the body, at the same time discharging their contents into\r\nthe veins while conveying the blood back to the heart from the whole\r\nsystem. Is it not reasonable to suppose that besides being nutrient\r\ncenters, that they accumulate and pass water through the whole secretory\r\nand excretory systems of the body, in order to reduce nourishment to\r\nthat degree from thick to thin, that it may easily pass through all\r\ntubes, ducts and vessels interested in distribution, as nourishment\r\nfirst, and renovation second, through the excretory ducts. The question\r\narises whence cometh this water?\r\n\r\n\r\nDANGERS OF DEAD SUBSTANCES.\r\n\r\nThis leads us back to the lungs as one of the great sources of which you\r\nhave been informed under the head of \"Lungs, Gases and Water.\" With this\r\nfountain of life saving water provided by nature to wash away impurities\r\nas they accumulate in our bodies, would it not be great stupidity in us\r\nto see a human being burn to death by the fires of fever, or die from\r\nasphyxia by allowing bad or dead lymph, albumen, or any substance to\r\nload down the powers of nature and keep the blood from being washed to\r\nnormal purity? If so, let us go deeper into the study of the life-saving\r\npowers of the lymphatics. Do we not find in death that the lymphatics\r\nare dark, and in life they are healthy and red?\r\n\r\n\r\nLYMPH CONTINUED.\r\n\r\nWhat we meet with in all diseases is dead blood, stagnant lymph, and\r\nalbumen in a semi-vital or dead and decomposing condition all through\r\nthe lymphatics and other parts of the body, brain, lungs, kidneys, liver\r\nand fascia. The whole system is loaded with a confused mass of blood,\r\nthat is mixed with much or little unhealthy substances, that should have\r\nbeen kept washed out by lymph. Stop and view the frog's superficial\r\nlymphatic glands; you see all parts move just as regular as the heart\r\ndoes; they are all in motion during life. For what purpose do they move?\r\nif not to carry the fluids to sustain by building up, while the\r\nexcretory channels receive and pass out all that is of no further use to\r\nthe body. Now we see this great system of supply is the source of\r\nconstruction and purity. If this be true we must keep them normal all\r\nthe time or see confused nature in the form of disease, the list\r\nthrough. Thus we strike at the source of life and death when we go to\r\nthe lymphatics.\r\n\r\nWith this fountain of life-saving water, provided by nature to wash away\r\nimpurities as they accumulate in our bodies, would it not be great\r\nstupidity in us to see a human being burn to death by the fires of\r\nfever, or die from asphyxia, by allowing bad or dead lymph, albumen or\r\nany substance to load down the powers of nature to keep the blood washed\r\nto normal purity? If so let us go deeper in the study of the\r\nlife-sustaining powers of the lymphatics.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE'S SOLVENTS.\r\n\r\nThe brain flushes the nerves of the lymphatics first, and more than any\r\nother system of the body. No part is so small or remote that it is not\r\nin direct connection with some part or chain of the lymphatics. The\r\ndoctor of Osteopathy has much to think about when he consults natural\r\nremedies, and how they are supplied and administered, and as disease is\r\nthe effect of tardy deposits in some or all parts of the body, reason\r\nwould bring us to hunt a solvent of such deposits, which hinder the\r\nnatural motion of blood and other fluids in functional works, which are\r\nto keep the body pure from any substance that would check vital action.\r\nWhen we have searched and found that the lymphatics are almost the sole\r\nrequisite of the body we then must admit that their use is equal to the\r\nabundant and universal supply of such glands. If we think and use a\r\nhomely word and say that disease is only too much dirt in the wheels of\r\nlife, then we will see that nature takes this method to wash out the\r\ndirt. As an application, pneumonia is too much dirt in the wheels of the\r\nlungs, if so we must wash out; no where can we go to a better place for\r\nwater than to the lymphatics. Are they not like a fire company with\r\nnozzles in all windows ready to flush the burning house?\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE ARE THE LYMPHATICS SITUATED?\r\n\r\nA student of life must take in all parts, and study their uses and\r\nrelations to other parts and systems. We lay much stress on the uses of\r\nblood and the powers of the nerves, but have we any evidence that they\r\nare of more vital importance than the lymphatics? If not let us halt at\r\nthis universal system of irrigation and study its great uses in\r\nsustaining animal life. Where are they situated in the body? Answer by,\r\nwhere are they not? No space is so small as to be out of connection with\r\nthe lymphatics, with their nerves, secretory and excretory ducts. Thus\r\nthe system of lymphatics is complete and universal in the whole body.\r\nAfter beholding the lymphatics distributed along all nerves, blood\r\nchannels, muscles, glands and all organs of the body, from the brain to\r\nthe soles of the feet, all loaded to fullness with watery liquids, we\r\ncertainly can make but one conclusion as to their use, which would be to\r\nmingle with and carry out all impurities of the body, by first mixing\r\nwith such substances and reducing them to that degree of fluids in\r\nfineness, that could pass through the smallest tubes of the excretory\r\nsystem, and by that method free the body from all deposits of either\r\nsolids or fluids, and leave nourishment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FAT AND LEAN.\r\n\r\nA question: Why is he too fat and she only skin and bone, while a third\r\nis just right? If one is just right, why not all? If we get fat by a\r\nnatural process why not reverse the process and stop at any desirable\r\npoint in flesh size? I believe the law of life is simple and natural in\r\nboth respects if wisely understood. Have we nerves of motion to carry\r\nfood to all parts, organs, glands and muscles? Have we channels to\r\nconvey to all? Have we fluids to suit all demands? Have we brain power\r\nequal to all force needed? Is blood formed sufficiently to fill all\r\ndemands? Does that blood contain fat, water, muscle, skin, hair and all\r\nkinds to suit each division, organ, and nerve? If so and blood has\r\nbuilded too much flesh, can it not take that bulk away by returning\r\nblood to gas and other fluids? Can that which has been done be done\r\nagain? If yes be the correct answer, then we should hope to return\r\nblood, fat, flesh and bone to gas and pass them away while in gaseous\r\ncondition, and do away with all unnatural size or lack of size. I\r\nbelieve that it is natural to build and destroy all material form from\r\nthe lowest animated being to the greatest rolling world. I believe no\r\nworld could be constructed without strict obedience to a governing law,\r\nwhich gives size by addition and reduces that size by subtraction. Thus\r\na fat man is builded by great addition, and if desired can be reduced\r\nby much subtraction, which is simply a rule of numbers. We multiply to\r\nenlarge, also subtract when we wish a reduction. Turn your eye for a\r\ntime to the supply trains of nature. When the crop is abundant, the\r\nlading would be great, and when the seasons do not suit, the crops are\r\nshort or shorter to no lading at all. Thus we have the fat man and the\r\nlean man. Is it not reasonable as a conclusion of the most exacting\r\nphilosophy that the train of cars that can bring loads of stone, brick\r\nand mortar until a great bulk is formed, can also carry away until this\r\nbulk disappears in part or all? This being my conclusion I will say by\r\nmany years of careful observation of the work of creating bodies and\r\ndestroying the same, that to add to is the law of giving size, and to\r\nsubtract from is the law of reduction. Both are natural, and both can be\r\nmade practical in the reduction or addition of flesh, when found too\r\ngreat in quantity, or we can add to and give size to the starving muscle\r\nthrough the action of the motor and nutrient system conveyed to, and\r\nappropriated from the laboratory in which all bodily substances are\r\nformed. Thus the philosophy is absolute, and the sky is clear to proceed\r\nwith addition and subtraction of flesh. I believe I am prepared to say\r\nat this time that I understand the nervous system well enough to direct\r\nthe laboratory of nature and cause it through its skilled arts to\r\nunload, or reduce, he who is over-burdened with a super-abundance of\r\nflesh, and add to the scanty muscle a sufficiency to give power of\r\ncomfortable locomotion and other forces, by opening the gate of the\r\nsupply trains of nutrition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE DIAPHRAGM.\r\n\r\n     Investigation--A Struggle With Nature--Lesson of Cause and\r\n     Effect--Something of Medical Etiquette--The Medical Doctor--An\r\n     Explorer for Truth Must Be Independent--The Diaphragm Introduced--A\r\n     Useful Study--Combatting Effect--Is Least Understood--A Case of\r\n     Bilious Fever--A Demand on the Nerves--Danger of Compression--A\r\n     Cause for Disease--Was a Mistake Made in the Creation--An\r\n     Exploration--Result of Removal of Diaphragm--Sustaining Life in\r\n     Principles--Law Applicable to Other Organs--Power of\r\n     Diaphragm--Omentum.\r\n\r\n\r\nINVESTIGATION.\r\n\r\nLet us halt at the origin of the splanchnic and take a look. At this\r\npoint we see the lower branches; sensation, motion, and nutrition, all\r\nslant above the diaphragm pointing to the solar plexus which sends off\r\nbranches to pudic and sacral plexus of sensory system of nerves; just at\r\nthe place to join the life giving ganglion of sacrum with orders from\r\nthe brain to keep the process of blood forming in full motion all the\r\ntime. A question arises, how is this motion supplied and from where? The\r\nanswer is by the brain as nerve supply, heart as blood supply, all of\r\nwhich comes from above the diaphragm, to keep machinery in form and\r\nsupplied with motion, that it may be able to generate chyle to send back\r\nto heart, to be formed into blood and thrown into arteries to build all\r\nparts as needed, and keep brain fed up to its normal supply of power\r\ngenerating needs. We see above the diaphragm, the lungs, heart and\r\nbrain, the three sources of blood and nerve supply. All three are\r\nguarded by strong walls, that they may do their part in keeping up the\r\nlife supply as far as blood and nerve force is required. But as they\r\ngenerate no blood nor nerve material, they must take the place of\r\nmanufactories and purchase material from a foreign land, to be able to\r\nhave an abundance all the time. We see nature has placed its\r\nmanufacturies above a given line in the breast, and grows the crude\r\nmaterial below said line. Now as growth means motion and supply, we must\r\ncombine in a friendly way, and conduct the force from above to the\r\nregion below the septum or diaphragm, that we may use the powers as\r\nneeded. This wall must and does have openings to let blood and nerves\r\npenetrate with supply and force to do the work of manufacturing.\r\n\r\n\r\nA STRUGGLE WITH NATURE.\r\n\r\nAfter all this has been done and a twist, pressure or obstructing fold\r\nshould appear from any cause, would we not have a cut off of motion to\r\nreturn chyle, sensation to supply vitality, and venous motion to carry\r\noff arterial supply that has been driven from heart above? Have we not\r\nfound the cause to stop all processes of life below diaphragm? In short,\r\nare we not in a condition to soon be in a complete state of stagnation?\r\nAs soon as the arteries have filled the venous system, which is without\r\nsensation to return blood to the heart, then the heart can do nothing\r\nbut wear out its energies trying to drive blood into a dead being below\r\nthe diaphragm known as the venous system. It is dead until sensation\r\nreaches the vein from the sacral and pudic plexus.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON OF CAUSE AND EFFECT.\r\n\r\nPrevious to all discoveries that have been made a demand for the\r\nusefulness of such discovery, is felt and talked of for years, centuries\r\nand cycles of time. Its discovery is an open question and free to all,\r\nbecause in this fact all are interested. That lack may be felt and\r\nspoken of by all agriculturists, and the inquiry directed to a better\r\nplow, a better sickle or mowing machine with which to reap standing\r\ngrain. The thinker reduces his thoughts to practice, and cuts the grain,\r\nleaving it in such condition that a raker is needed to bunch it previous\r\nto binding.\r\n\r\nHis victory is heralded to the world as king of the harvest, and so\r\naccepted. The discoverer says, \"I wish I could bunch that grain.\" He\r\nbegins to reason from the great principle of cause and effect, and\r\nsleeps not until he has added to his already made discovery, an addition\r\nso ingeniously constructed that it will drop the grain in bunches ready\r\nfor the binder. The discoverer stands by and sees in the form of a human\r\nbeing hands, arms and a band; he watches the motion then starts in to\r\nrustle with cause and effect again. He thinks and sweats day and night,\r\nand by the genius of thought produces a machine to bind the grain. By\r\nthis time another suggestion arises, how to separate the wheat as the\r\nmachine journeys in its cutting process. To his convictions nothing will\r\nsolve this problem but mental action. He thinks and dreams of cause and\r\neffect. His mind seems to forget all the words of his mother tongue but\r\ncause and effect. He talks and preaches cause and effect in so many\r\nplaces that his associates begin to think he is mentally failing, and\r\nwill soon be a subject for the asylum. He becomes disgusted with their\r\nlack of appreciation, seeks seclusion and formulates the desired\r\naddition and threshes the grain ready for the bag. He has solved the\r\nquestion and proved to his neighbors that the asylum was built for them,\r\nnot for him. With cause and effect which is ever before the\r\nphilosopher's eye, he ploughs the ocean regardless of the furious\r\nwaves, he dreads not the storms on the seas, because he has so\r\nconstructed a vessel with a resistance superior to the force of the\r\nlashing waves of the ocean, and the world scores him another victory. He\r\nopens his mouth and says by the law of cause and effect I will talk to\r\nmy mother who is hundreds of miles away. He disturbs her rest by the\r\nrattling of a little electric bell in her room. Tremblingly the aged\r\nmother approaches the telephone and asks \"Who is there?\" And is\r\nanswered, \"It is me, Jimmie,\" and asks, \"To whom am I talking?\" She says\r\n\"Mrs. Sarah Murphy.\" He says, \"God bless you, mother; I am at Galveston,\r\nTexas, and you are in Boston, Mass.\" She laughs and cries with joy; he\r\nhears every emotion of her trembling voice. She says to him, \"You have\r\nsucceeded at last. I have never doubted your final success,\r\nnotwithstanding the neighbors have annoyed me almost to death, telling\r\nme you would land in the asylum, because no man could talk so as to be\r\nheard 1000 miles away; his lungs, were too weak, and his tongue too\r\nshort.\"\r\n\r\nNow, friends, I have given you a long introductory foundation previous\r\nto giving you the cause of disease, with the philosophy that I have\r\ngiven upon cause and effect. I think it absolutely clear and the effect\r\nso unerring in its results, that with Pythagoras I can say \"Eureka.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMETHING OF MEDICAL ETIQUETTE.\r\n\r\nTo know we have found a general cause for disease, one that will stand\r\nthe heights and depths of direct and cross examinations, as given by the\r\nhigh courts of cool headed reason, has been the mental effort of all\r\ndoctors and healers, since time began its record. They have had to treat\r\ndisease as best they could, by such methods as customs had established\r\nas the best known for such diseases; notwithstanding their failures and\r\nthe great mortality under such a system of treatment. They have not felt\r\njustified to go beyond the rules of symptomatology as adopted by their\r\nschools, with diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Should they digress\r\nfrom the rules of the etiquette of their alma maters they would lose the\r\nbrotherly love and support of the medical association to which they\r\nbelong, under the belief that, \"A bad name is as bad as death to a dog.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEDICAL DOCTOR.\r\n\r\nHe says that in union there is safety, and resolves to stick to, live\r\nand do as his school has disciplined all its pupils, with this command,\r\n\"The day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die. Stick to the\r\nbrotherhood.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EXPLORER FOR TRUTH MUST BE INDEPENDENT.\r\n\r\nThe explorer for truth must first declare his independence of all\r\nobligations or brotherhoods of any kind whatsoever. He must be free to\r\nthink and reason. He must establish his observatory upon hills of his\r\nown; he must establish them above the imaginary high planes of rulers,\r\nkings, professors of schools of all kinds and denominations. He must be\r\nthe Czar of his own mental empire, unencumbered with anything that will\r\nannoy while he makes his observations. I believe the reasons are so\r\nplain, so easily comprehended, the facts in its support so brilliant,\r\nthat I will offer the same, though I be slaughtered on the altar of\r\nbigotry and intolerance. This philosophy is not intended for minds not\r\nthoroughly well posted by dissection and otherwise of the whole human\r\nanatomy. You must know its physiological laboratories and workings with\r\nthe brain as the battery, the lungs as the source or machine that\r\nrenovates the blood from all impurities, and the heart as the living\r\nengine or quarter-master, whose duty is to supply the commissaries with\r\nblood and other fluids to all divisions and sub-divisions of the human\r\nbody, which is busily engaged producing material suited to the\r\nproduction of bone and muscle, and all other substances necessary to\r\nkeep the machinery of life in full force and action.\r\n\r\nWithout this knowledge on the part of the reader, the words of this\r\nphilosophy will fall as blanks before reaching his magazine of reason.\r\nThus this is addressed to the independent man or woman that can, will\r\nand does reason.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIAPHRAGM INTRODUCED.\r\n\r\nAt this point we will introduce the diaphragm, which separates the\r\nheart, lungs and brain from the organs of life that are limited to the\r\nabdomen and pelvis. A question arises at this point; what has the\r\ndiaphragm to do with good or bad health? At this time we will analyze\r\nthe diaphragm; we will examine its construction, and its uses; we will\r\nexamine its openings through which blood passes both above and below. We\r\nwill examine the opening through which food passes to stomach. We will\r\ncarefully examine the passage or opening for nerve supply to the abdomen\r\nbelow, to run this great system of chemistry, which is producing the\r\nvarious kinds of substances necessary to the hard and soft parts of the\r\nbody. We must know the nerve supply of the lymphatics, womb, liver,\r\nkidneys, pancreas, the generative organs, what they are, what they do,\r\nand what are demanded of them, before we are able to feed our own minds\r\nfrom the cup that contains the essence of reason as expressed from the\r\ntree of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nA USEFUL STUDY.\r\n\r\nThe diaphragm surely gives much food to the one who would search for the\r\ngreat whys of disease as reported causes seem to be far back in the fogs\r\nof mystery. It may help us to arrive at some facts if we take each organ\r\nand division and make a full acquaintance of all its parts and uses\r\nbefore we combine it with others.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMBATTING EFFECTS.\r\n\r\nIn all ages, the Doctor has for lack of knowledge of the true cause of\r\ndiseases, combatted effects with his remedies. He treats pain with\r\nremedies to deaden pain; congestion to wash out overplus of blood that\r\nhas been carried to parts or organs of the body by arteries of blood and\r\nchannels of secretions and not taken up and passed out and off by the\r\nexcretories. He sees the abnormal size and leaves the hunting of the\r\ncause that has given growth to such proportions and begins to seek rest\r\nand ease for his patient. Then he treats to reduce by medicine to carry\r\nthe waste fluids to bowels, bladder and skin, with tonics to give\r\nstrength and stimulants to increase the action of the heart in order to\r\nforce local deposits to the general excretory system. At this time let\r\nthe Osteopathic Doctor take a close hunt for any fold in muscles of the\r\nsystem that would cause a cut-off of the normal supply of blood or\r\nsuspend the action of nerves whose office is to give power and action to\r\nthe excretory system sufficient to keep the dead matter carried off as\r\nfast as it accumulates. Let us stop and acquaint ourselves with the true\r\ncondition of the diaphragm. It must be normal in place, as it is so\r\nsituated that it will admit of no abnormality. It must be kept\r\nstretched, just as Nature arranged that it should, like a drum-head. It\r\nis attached all around to the chest, though it crosses five or six ribs\r\non its descent from the seventh rib to the sternum at the lower point\r\nand down to fourth lumbar vertebra. It is a continuous slanting floor,\r\nabove bowels and abdominal organs, and below heart and lungs. It must,\r\nby all reason, be kept normal in tightness at all places, without a fold\r\nor wrinkle, that could press the aorta, nerves, oesophagus, or\r\nanything that contributes to the supply or circulation of any vital\r\nsubstance. Now can there be any move in spine or ribs that would or\r\ncould change the normal shape of the diaphragm? If so, where and why?\r\n\r\n\r\nIS LEAST UNDERSTOOD.\r\n\r\nThe diaphragm is possibly the least understood as being the cause of\r\nmore diseases, when its supports are not all in line and normal\r\nposition, than any other part of the body. It has many openings through\r\nwhich nerves, blood and food pass while going from chest to all parts\r\nbelow. It begins at the lower end of the breast-bone and crosses to ribs\r\nback and down, in a slanting direction to the third or fourth lumbar\r\nvertebra. Like an apron, it holds all that is above it up, such as heart\r\nand lungs, and is the fence that divides the organs of the abdomen from\r\nthe chest. Below it are the stomach, bowels, liver, spleen, kidneys,\r\npancreas, womb, bladder; also the great system of lymphatics of the\r\nwhole blood and nerve supply of the organs and systems of nutrition and\r\nlife supply. All parts of the body have a direct or indirect connection\r\nwith this great separating muscle. It assists in breathing, in all\r\nanimals, when normal, and when prolapsed by the falling in and down of\r\nany of the five or six ribs by which it is supported in place, then we\r\nsuffer from the effects of suspended normal arterial supply, and venous\r\nstagnation below diaphragm. The aorta meets resistance as it goes down\r\nwith blood to nourish, and the vein as it goes back with impurities\r\ncontained in venous blood, also meets an obstruction at the diaphragm,\r\nas it returns to the heart through the vena cava, because of the packing\r\nof a fallen diaphragm on and about the blood vessels that must not be\r\nobstructed. Thus heart trouble, lung disease, brain, liver, womb, tumors\r\nof the abdomen and through the list of effects can be traced to the\r\ndiaphragm as the cause.\r\n\r\nI am strongly impressed that the diaphragm has much to do in keeping all\r\nthe machinery and organs of life in a healthy condition, and will try\r\nand give some of the reasons why, as I now understand them. First, it is\r\nfound to be wisely located just below the heart and lungs; one being the\r\nengine of the blood, and the other is the engine of the air. This strong\r\nwall holds all substances or other bodies away from any chance to press\r\non either engine, while performing their parts in the economy of life.\r\nEach engine has a sacred duty to perform under the penal law of death to\r\nitself and all other divisions of the whole being, man. If it should\r\nneglect its work of which it is a vital part, should we take down this\r\nwall and allow the liver, stomach and spleen to occupy any of the places\r\nallotted to these engines of life, a confusion would surely be the\r\nresult; ability of the heart to force blood to the lungs would be\r\novercome and cause trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CASE OF BILIOUS FEVER.\r\n\r\nSuppose we take a few diseases and submit them to the crucial ordeal of\r\nreason, and see if we do, or can find any one of the climatic fevers\r\nthat appear with its full list of symptoms and have no assistance from\r\nan irritated diaphragm. For example take a case of common bilious fever\r\nof North America. It generally begins with a tired and sore feeling of\r\nlimbs and muscles, pain in spine, head, and lumbar region. At this point\r\nof our inquiry we are left in an open sea of mystery and conjecture as\r\nto cause. One says, \"malaria,\" and goes no farther, gives a name and\r\nstops. If you ask for the cause of such torturous pain in head and back,\r\nwith fever and vomiting, he will tell you that the very best authorities\r\nagree that the cause is malaria, with its peculiar diagnostic tendency\r\nto affect the brain, spine and stomach, and administers quinine and\r\nleaves, thinking he has said and done all.\r\n\r\nReason would lead seekers for cause of the pain above located to\r\nremember that all blood passes first as chyme up to heart and lungs,\r\ndirectly through the diaphragm, conducted through the thoracic duct,\r\nfirst to heart, thence to lungs, at the same time rivers of blood are\r\npouring into the heart from all of the system. Much of it very impure,\r\nfrom diseased or stale blood. Much of the chyle is dead before it enters\r\nthe great thoracic duct and goes to the lungs without enough pure blood\r\nto sustain life. Then disease appears.\r\n\r\nAs a cut-off the diaphragm, when dropped front and down, and across the\r\naorta and vena cava by a lowering of the ribs, on both sides of the\r\nspine; it would be a complete pressure over coelic axis, with liver\r\nsupply, renal, pelvic, to a complete abdominal stoppage. Then we have\r\nover-due blood for other parts to send off dead corpuscles by asphyxia,\r\nwith no hope that it can sustain life and health of the parts for which\r\nit was designed. Thus we know that nature would not be true to its own\r\nlaws, if it would do good work with bad material.\r\n\r\n\r\nA DEMAND ON THE NERVES.\r\n\r\nWhy not reason on the broad scale of known fact, and give the \"why\" he\r\nor she has complete prostration when all systems are wholly cut off from\r\na chance to move and execute such duties as nature has allotted to them.\r\nMotor nerves must drive all substances to, and sensation must judge the\r\nsupply and demand. Nutrition must be in action all the time and keep all\r\nparts well supplied or a failure is sure to appear. We must ever\r\nremember the demands of nature on the lymphatics, liver and kidneys,\r\nthat nerves work all the time or a confusion for lack in their duties\r\nwill mark a cripple in some function of life over which they preside.\r\n\r\n\r\nDANGER OF COMPRESSION.\r\n\r\nAt this time we see by all systems of reason that no delay in passage of\r\nfood or blood, can be tolerated at the diaphragm, because any\r\nirritation is bound to cause muscular contraction and impede the\r\nnatural flow of blood, first through the abdominal aorta, and even to a\r\ntemporary, partial or complete stoppage of arterial supply to the\r\nabdomen. Or the vena cava may be so pressed as to completely stop the\r\nreturn of venous blood from the stomach, kidneys, bowels and all other\r\norgans, such as the lymphatics, pancreas, fascia, cellular membranes,\r\nnerve centers, ganglionic and all systems of supply of organs of life\r\nfound in the abdomen. Thus by pressure, stricture or contraction to the\r\npassage of blood can be stopped, either above or below the diaphragm,\r\nand be the cause of blood being detained long enough to die from\r\nasphyxia, and be left in the body of all organs below the diaphragm.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CAUSE FOR DISEASE.\r\n\r\nThus you see a cause for Bright's disease of kidneys, disease of womb,\r\novaries, jaundice, dysentery, leucorrhoea, painful monthlies, spasms,\r\ndyspepsia, and on through the whole list of diseases now booked as\r\n\"causes unknown,\" and treated by the rule of \"cut and try.\" We do know\r\nthat all blood for use of the whole system below the twelfth dorsal\r\nvertebra does pass through the diaphragm, and all nerve supply, also\r\npasses through the diaphragm and spinal column for limb and life. This\r\nbeing a known fact, we have only to use reason to know that an\r\nunhealthy condition of the diaphragm is bound to be followed by many\r\ndiseases. A list of questions arise at this point with the inquirers\r\nthat must and can be answered every time by reason only. The diaphragm\r\nis a musculo-fibrinous organ and depends for blood and nerve supply\r\nabove its own location, and that supply must be given freely and pure\r\nfor nerve and blood or we will have a diseased organ to start with; then\r\nwe may find a universal atrophy or oedema, which would, besides its\r\nown deformity not be able to rise and fall, to assist the lungs to mix\r\nair with blood to purify venous blood, as it is carried to the lungs to\r\nthrow off impurities and take on oxygen previous to returning to the\r\nheart, to be sent off as nourishment for the system. It is only in\r\nkeeping with reason that without a healthy diaphragm both in its form\r\nand action, disease is bound to be the result. A question from our side\r\nof the argument is: How can a carpenter build a good house out of\r\nrotten, twisted or warped wood? If he can, then we can hope to be\r\nhealthy with diseased blood, but if we must have good material in\r\nbuilding, then we should form our thoughts to suit the heads of\r\ninspectors, and inspect the passage of blood through the diaphragm,\r\npleury, pericardium and the fascia, superficial, deep and universal.\r\nDisease is just as liable to begin its work in the fascia and\r\nepithelium as any other place. Thus the necessity of pure blood and\r\nhealthy fascia, because all functions are equally responsible for good\r\nand bad results.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS A MISTAKE MADE IN THE CREATION?\r\n\r\nAt a given period of time the Lord said, \"Let us make man.\" After He had\r\nmade him He examined him, and pronounced him good, and not only good,\r\nbut very good. Did He know what good was? Had He the skill to be a\r\ncompetent judge? If He was perfectly competent to judge skilled arts His\r\napproval of the work when done was the fiat of mental competency backed\r\nby perfection. Since that architect and skilled mechanic has finished\r\nman and given him dominion over the fowls of the air, the beast of the\r\nfield and fishes of the sea, hasn't that person, being or superstructure\r\nproven to us that God, the creator of all things, has armed him with\r\nstrength, with the mind and machinery to direct and execute? This being\r\ndemonstrated and leaving us without a doubt as to its perfection, are we\r\nnot admonished by all that is good and great to enter upon a minute\r\nexamination of all the parts belonging to this being; acquaint ourselves\r\nwith their uses and all the designs for which the whole being was\r\ncreated. If we are honestly interested with the acquaintance of the\r\nforms and uses of the parts in detail by close and thorough examination\r\nof the material, its form and object of its form, from whence this\r\nsubstance is obtained; how it is produced and sustained through life in\r\nkind and form. How it is moved, where it gets its power, and for what\r\nobject does it move? A demand for a crucial examination of the skull,\r\nthe heart, lungs, of the chest, the stomach, liver and other organs of\r\nthe abdomen is made. The septum of the brain, the pericardium of the\r\nchest--the diaphragm of the abdomen which is a dividing septum between\r\nthe abdomen and chest. In this examination we must know the reasons why\r\nany organs, vessel or any other substance is located at a given place.\r\nWe must run with all the rivers of blood that travel through the system.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EXPLORATION.\r\n\r\nWe must start our exploring boat with the aorta, and float with this\r\nvital current; see the captain as he unloads supplies for the diaphragm\r\nand all that is under it. We must follow him and see what branch of this\r\nriver will lead to a little or great toe, or to the terminals of the\r\nwhole foot. We must pass through the waters of the dead sea by the way\r\nof the vena cava, and observe the boats loaded with exhausted and worn\r\nout blood, as it is poured in and channeled back to the heart, with all\r\nbelow the diaphragm. Carefully watch the emptying of the vena azygos\r\nmajor and minor, with the veins of the arms and head all being poured in\r\nfrom little or great rivers to the vena innominate on their way to the\r\ngreat hospital of life and nourishment; whose quarter-master is the\r\nheart; whose finishing mechanic is the lung. Having acquainted ourselves\r\nwith the forms and locations of this great personality we are ready at\r\nthis time after examination, and found worthy and well qualified to\r\nenter into a higher class in which we can obtain an acquaintance with\r\nthe physiological workings separately and conjoined of the whole being.\r\nAt this place we become acquainted with the hows and whys of the\r\nproduction of blood, bone and all elements found in them, necessary to\r\nsustain sensation, motion, nutrition, voluntary and involuntary action\r\nof the nerve system. The hows and whys of the lymphatics, the life\r\nsustaining powers of the brain, heart, lungs, and all the abdominal\r\nsystem, with their various actions and uses, from the lowest cellular\r\nmembrane to the highest organ of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESULT OF REMOVAL OF DIAPHRAGM.\r\n\r\nWhen we consult the form of the cross-bar that divides the body in two\r\nconjoined divisions and reason on its use, we arrive at the fact that\r\nthe heart and lungs must have ample space or room to suit their actions\r\nwhile performing their functions. At this time a question comes up: What\r\neffect would follow the removal of the fence between heart, lungs and\r\nbrain, above that dividing muscle, and the machinery that is situated\r\nbelow said cross-bar? We see at a glance that we would meet failure to\r\nthe extent of the infringement on demanded room for normal work of heart\r\nto deliver below lungs to prepare blood, and the brain to pass nerve\r\npower to either engine above, and all organs below the diaphragm.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUSTAINING LIFE PRINCIPLES.\r\n\r\nThe life of the living tree is with the bark and superficial fascia\r\nwhich lies between the bark of the body of the tree, its periostium. The\r\nremainder of the tree takes the position or place of secreting. Its\r\nexcretory system is first upwards from the surface of the ground, and\r\nwashes out frozen impurities in the spring, after which it secretes and\r\nconveys to the ground through the trunk of the tree to the roots which\r\nis like unto the placenta attached to mother earth, qualifying all\r\nsubstances of constructing fiber and leaf, of that part of the tree\r\nabove the ground. Each year produces a new tree which is seen and known\r\nby circular rings called annular growths. That growth which was\r\ncompleted last year is now a stale being of the past and has no vital\r\naction of itself. But like all stale beings its process is a life of\r\nanother order, and dependent upon the fascia for its life and cellular\r\naction which lies under the bark, for its own existence as a living\r\ntree. It can only act as a chemical laboratory and furnish crude\r\nmaterial which is taken up by the superficial fascia and conveyed up to\r\nthe lungs, and exchanges dead for living matter, to receive and return\r\nto all parts of the tree, keeping up vital formation. With frost its\r\nvital process ceases through the winter season until mother earth\r\nstimulates the placenta, and starts the growth of a new being, which is\r\ndeveloped and placed in form on the old trunk. Thus you see everything\r\nof animal growth as we would call them, is a new being, and becomes a\r\npart of the next being or growth formed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTALE LIFE.\r\n\r\nShould this form of vitality cease with the tree another principle which\r\nwe call stale life takes possession and constructs another tree which is\r\njust the reverse of the living tree, and builds a tree after its own\r\npower of formulation from the dead matter, to which it imparts a\r\nprinciple of stale life, which life produces mushrooms, frogstools and\r\nother peculiar forms of stale beings, from this form of growth.\r\n\r\nThus we are prepared to reason that blood when ligated and retained in\r\nthat condition of dead corpuscles, and no longer able to support animal\r\nlife, can form a zoophyte and all the forms peculiar to the great law of\r\nassociation, as tumefactions of the lymphatics, pancreas, liver,\r\nkidneys, uterus, with all the glandular system, be they lymphatics,\r\ncellular, ganglia or any other parts of the body susceptible of such\r\ngrowths, below the diaphragm. Thus we can account for tubercles of the\r\nabdomen and all organs therein found.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW APPLICABLE TO OTHER ORGANS.\r\n\r\nThis same law is equally applicable to the heart, lungs, the brain,\r\ntissues, glands, fascia and all substances capable of receiving without\r\nthe ability to excrete stale substances.\r\n\r\nAs oedema marks the first tardiness of fluids we have the beginning\r\nstep which will lead from miliary tuberculosis to the largest known\r\nforms of tubercles, which is the effect of the active principles of\r\nstale life or the life of dead matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOWER OF DIAPHRAGM.\r\n\r\nAt this point we will draw the attention of the reader to the fact that\r\nthe diaphragm can contract and suspend the passage of blood and produce\r\nall the stagnant changes from start to completed deadly tubercle. Also\r\nthe cancer, the wen, glandular thickening of neck, face, scalp, fascia\r\nand all substances found above the diaphragm. In this stale life we have\r\na compass that will lead us as explorers from the North star, to the\r\nSouth pole, the rising sun of reason, and the evening dews of eternity.\r\nThis diaphragm says: \"By me you live and by me you die. I hold in my\r\nhand the powers of life and death, acquaint now thyself with me and be\r\nat ease.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOMENTUM.\r\n\r\nThe truth of the presentation of facts should be the principle object of\r\nevery person who takes his pen with a view to give the reasons why\r\ncertain witnesses' testimony are indispensable to establish supposable\r\nor known truths. This being the case I have summoned before this court\r\nof inquiry an important witness. He has now taken the oath to tell the\r\ntruth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, of the case before\r\nthis court. His name is the Great Omentum. Mr. Omentum, state if you\r\nknow of any reason why or how by irritation from a misplacement of your\r\nbody or any of its attachments to or about the diaphragm, the spine,\r\nstomach or other places that could cause irritation and thickening by\r\ncongestion of your own body to such degree as to impede the flow of\r\narterial or venous blood, over whose position you occupy much space from\r\nthe diaphragm downward? State what effect a falling down of the eleventh\r\nand twelfth ribs on both sides of the spine with their cartilaginous\r\npoints turned inward and down; if they should draw the diaphragm down\r\nand across your body? What would be the effect on circulation of the\r\nblood, and other fluids on the kidneys and other organs of the abdomen\r\nand pelvis? Would it not be the foundation for destructive congestion,\r\nand abnormal growth? State if you know if any such ligation would cause\r\nswelling by retention of blood in the spleen, liver, kidneys or other\r\norgans of the abdomen and pelvis? Would it be reasonable to suppose that\r\nyou could perform your functions in office with any irritating condition\r\ncaused by prolapses of diaphragm? Would not an irritation of your\r\nattachment to the diaphragm, spine or stomach be great enough to impede\r\nthe blood on its passage through the aorta to the abdomen, or impede the\r\nflow of blood back and through the diaphragm? If so state how and why?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nLIVER, BOWELS AND KIDNEYS.\r\n\r\n     Gender of the Liver--Productions of the Liver--A Hope for the\r\n     Afflicted--Evidences of Truth--Loaded With Ignorance--Lack of\r\n     Knowledge of the Kidney--How a Purgative Acts--Flux--Bloody\r\n     Dysentery--Flux More Fully Described--Osteopathic Remedies--Medical\r\n     Remedies--More of the Osteopathic Remedy.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENDER OF THE LIVER.\r\n\r\nLet us abruptly assume that the liver is the abiding placenta of all\r\nanimated beings. If this position be true we are warranted and justified\r\nin the conclusion that the germs necessary to form blood vessels and\r\nother parts of the body must look to the liver for the fluids in which\r\nthey would expect to construct in form and size. It seems to be nature's\r\nchemical laboratory, in which are prepared by receiving chemical\r\nqualities and quantities to suit the formation of hard and soft\r\nsubstances, which are to become the parts and the whole of any organ,\r\ngland, muscle, nerve, cell, veins and arteries. In evidence of the\r\nprobability of the truth of this position, we will draw your attention,\r\nfirst to its central location between the sacral and cerebral nerve\r\ncenters. There it lies between the \"stomach\" the vessel which receives\r\nall material previous to being manipulated for all nutrient purposes,\r\nand the heart, the great receiving and distributing quarter-master of\r\nall animal life. It supplies squads, sections, companies, regiments,\r\nbattalions, brigades and divisions--to the whole army, and all parts\r\nthat are dependent upon the nutrient system.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTIONS OF THE LIVER.\r\n\r\nThe liver seems to be able to qualify by calling to itself all\r\nsubstances necessary to produce gall. Its communications with all parts\r\nof the body is direct, circuitous, universal and absolute. If pure it\r\nproduces healthy gall and other substances, and in fact when healthy\r\nitself all other fluids are considered to be pure, at which time we are\r\nsupposed to enjoy good health and universal bodily comfort. With a\r\ndiseased liver we have perverted action which possibly accounts for\r\nimpure and unhealthy deposits in the nasal passage and other parts of\r\nthe body in their own peculiar form. Polypus of the nose, tumefaction of\r\nlungs, lymphatics, liver, kidneys, uterus, and even the brain itself.\r\nSuppose such deposits, composed of albumen and fibrin, prepared in the\r\nliver should be deposited in the lining membranes of veins leading to\r\nthe heart, and by some other chemical action this accumulated mass\r\nshould come loose from the veins, would we not expect what is commonly\r\ncalled clots enter the heart, and shut off the arteries, supplying the\r\nlungs, stop the further circulation of blood and cause instantaneous\r\ndeath called heart failure, apoplexy and so on? Is it not reasonable to\r\nsuppose that under those deposits that softening of arteries has its\r\nbeginning, which results in aneurisms and death by rupture of such\r\nabnormally formed arteries? Are the lungs not liable to receive such\r\ndeposits and form tubercles to such proportions as to become living\r\nzoophytes capable of covering all of the mucous membrane of the lungs,\r\nair passages and cells, and establish a perpetual dwelling of zoophytes\r\nand absorb to themselves for their own maintenance and existence, blood\r\nand nourishment of the whole body unto death? This being the result of\r\none chemical action of the body and all by and from nature, is it not\r\nreasonable to suppose that the provision by nature is ready to produce\r\nof itself the chemicals of kind, quality and quantity equal to the\r\ndestruction of this enemy of life?\r\n\r\n\r\nA HOPE FOR THE AFFLICTED.\r\n\r\nI think before all diseases pass the zenith, after which the decline is\r\nbeyond the vital rally, they are curable by the genius of nature's own\r\nremedies, and believe the truths of this conclusion have been supported\r\nabundantly by daily demonstrations. I believe there is hope for the\r\nconsumptive equal to one-half if not greater when taken in proper time,\r\nwhich is at any period of the disease, previous to breaking down by\r\nulceration or otherwise, lung tissue, and even after this period, hope\r\nis not altogether lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVIDENCES OF TRUTH.\r\n\r\nNature and good sense are terms that mean much to persons who are used\r\nto set aside all else for facts. A fact may and often does stay before\r\nour eyes for all time powerful in truth, but we heed not its lessons.\r\nInstances, at least a few, would not be amiss at this time. Electricity,\r\nthe most powerful force known, was never able with all its works to get\r\nthe attention of man's thoughts, more than to call it thunder and\r\nlightning, and let it pass from his mind from time to time, till\r\nbrighter ages woke up a Franklin, Edison, Morse and others who heeded\r\nits useful lessons enough to make application of its powers for its\r\nforce and speed. By the results obtained, they and others have used its\r\npowers and gotten truths as rewards, that they did not know even existed\r\nin or out of electricity or in any of the store-houses of all nature.\r\nBut as the winds of time have blown open a few leaves of nature's book,\r\nand their brilliant pages and useful lessons have found a lodging place\r\nin such persons as were endowed with wisdom to see, and patience to\r\npersevere, by their energy and wisdom to-day we have many pages to add\r\nto our books of useful knowledge. We can now talk around and all over\r\nthe earth by the power of the dreaded thunder and lightning. By it we\r\ntravel, by it we see at night, by it we search on land and sea for\r\nfriend or foe; in fact, it is dreaded no more but sought, used and loved\r\nby all who know of its uses in civil life. Thus our enemy has become our\r\nfootstool. By the speed of man's ability we know and use the comforts\r\nthat nature holds in store for us until we call for and use them.\r\n\r\nOther and just as useful questions as electricity await our attention.\r\nParts and uses of the human body, to-day are to us as little understood\r\nas electricity was at any time. The lung to-day is an unknown mystery,\r\nas to what its power and uses are; we only know that air goes in and out\r\nof the lungs; farther than that we are at sea. We have just as little\r\nknowledge of the heart as the lungs, we find a hollow fibrinous tank\r\nreceiving and discharging blood; we are not prepared to say whether the\r\ncorpuscle is formed in the heart or not; all else is conjectural and\r\nspeculative on the subject the corpuscle. We see channels leading to and\r\nfrom it, to and from all parts of the body, muscles and glands. We know\r\nit moves when we are alive, we know it is silent in death.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOADED WITH IGNORANCE.\r\n\r\nWe pass from there to the liver loaded down with ignorance, from what we\r\nknow, cannot tell whether it is male or female, we simply know its size,\r\nlocation and something of its form and action, but nothing beyond\r\nconjecture. It stands to-day one of the wonders to him that tries to\r\nreason.\r\n\r\n\r\nLACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE KIDNEY.\r\n\r\nWe will leave this organ of many pounds with an open confession of our\r\nignorance and take up the kidney. At what time was the man and woman\r\nborn that knew and left on record a true and reliable knowledge of the\r\nrenal capsule. We do not know whether that is the organ that makes our\r\nteeth, our hair or generates a powerful acid by which lime is kept in\r\nsolution, so as not to form stones and such deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW A PURGATIVE ACTS.\r\n\r\nNature's method is simple and easily comprehended in delivering\r\npurgative medicines, with their softening powers to dry constipated\r\nfecal matter. For instance: We would give a purgative in the shape of\r\nsalts, rhubarb, calomel and other substances of choice. The first\r\nquestion of the physician is how is this to pass through so densely\r\npacked substance or fecal matter which is in the bowels? At this time we\r\nwill be short in the statement. The purgative poisons are taken up by\r\nthe the secretions conveyed to the lymphatics. To soften and wash out is\r\nthe object of nature. The lymphatics begin the work of washing out by\r\nstarting action of the excretories and furnishes the water to soften,\r\nwhich is injected into the bowels from the mouth to the extremities by a\r\nsystem of salivation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLUX (BLOODY DYSENTERY.)\r\n\r\nFlux is common in all temperate climates. It generally shows its true\r\nnature as dysentery after a few hours of tiresome feeling, aching in\r\nhead, back and bowels. At first nothing is felt or thought of more than\r\na few movements of the bowels than is common for each day. Some pain and\r\ngriping are felt with increase at each stool, until a chilly feeling is\r\nfelt all over the body, with violent pains in lower bowels, with\r\npressing desire to go to stool, and during and after passage of stool a\r\nfeeling that there is still something in the bowels that must pass. Soon\r\nthat down pressure partially subsides, and on examination of passage a\r\nquantity of blood is seen which shows the case is bloody flux, as the\r\ndisease is called and known in the southern states of North America, or\r\nbloody dysentery in the more northern states. It generally subsides by\r\nthe use of family remedies, such as sedatives, astringents, and\r\npalliative diets. But the severity in other cases increases and the\r\ndischarges have more blood, greater pain, mixed with gelatinous\r\nsubstance even to mucous membrane of bowels, high fever all over except\r\nabdomen, which is quite cold to the hand. Back, head and limbs suffer\r\nmuch with heat and pain, and much nausea is felt at all motions of\r\nbowels. Bowels change from cold to hot, even to 104, at which time all\r\nsymptoms point to inflammation of the bowels. The colon in particular,\r\nat which time discharge grows black, frothy and very offensive from\r\ndecomposition of blood. Soon collapse and death close out the case,\r\nnotwithstanding the very best skill has been employed to save the life\r\nof the patient. The doctor has tried to stop pain by opiates and other\r\nsedatives, tried to check bowels with astringents, used tonics and\r\nstimulants, but all have failed, the patient is dead.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW DOES THE OSTEOPATH CURE?\r\n\r\nBut the question for the Osteopath is: At what point would you work to\r\nsuppress the sensation of the colon and permit veins to open and allow\r\nblood to return to heart? Does irritation of a sensory nerve cause vein\r\nto contract and refuse blood to complete circuit from and to the heart?\r\nDoes flux begin with the sensory nerves of bowels? If so, reduce\r\nsensation at all points connecting with bowels, stop all overplus, keep\r\nveins free and open from cutaneous to deep sensory ganglion of whole\r\nspine and abdomen. Remember the fascia is what suffers and dies in all\r\ncases of death by bowels and lungs. Thus the nerves of all the fascia of\r\nbowels and abdomen must work or you may lose all cases of flux, for in\r\nthe fascia exists much of the soothing and vital qualities of nature.\r\nGuard it well, so it can work to repair all losses or death will begin\r\nin fascia and through pass it to the whole system.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLUX MORE FULLY DESCRIBED.\r\n\r\n\"Bloody flux\" is a flow of blood with other fluids from the mucous\r\nmembrane of the bowels. A disease generally of the summer and fall\r\nseasons, and is more abundant south than north of latitude 40° of North\r\nAmerica. It is so well known in this country by its ravages that to\r\ndescribe it is almost useless, as bloody fluids pass from bowels in all\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nWe reason that the veins have contracted by nerve irritation and fail to\r\nconvey blood to heart on normal time. By which delay decomposition does\r\nits work. Thus a cause is seen for excreting fluids by motor action of\r\nbowels, when supplied by the excretory system.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSTEOPATHIC REMEDIES.\r\n\r\nAn Osteopath to successfully treat flux or bloody dysentery must reason\r\nand address his attention first to the soreness and irritation of\r\nbowels, which he finds suffering with oedema of mucous membrane of all\r\nthe glands and blood vessels belonging to the lower bowels. As quiet is\r\nthe first thing desired, he will direct his attention to the sensory\r\nnerves of the colon and small intestines, in order to reduce the\r\nresistance of the veins and diminish the arterial action. When he has\r\ndiminished sensation of the veins of the bowels, the arterial force\r\ncompletes its circuit through the veins back to the heart, with much\r\nless arterial action, because venous resistance has ceased and the\r\ncircuit is normal, and healthy action is the result.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICAL REMEDIES.\r\n\r\nThe medicine man addresses his remedies first to the misery, with the\r\ndesire to relax the nerves and overcome pain, and obtains this result\r\nthrough some class of opiates. After a short rest he addresses his\r\nattention to the motor action of the heart, with the view of giving\r\narteries greater power to force arterial blood through all obstructions,\r\nand tries to stop all excretory wastings by the use of astringents\r\ncombined with sedatives and soothing fluids.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORE OF THE OSTEOPATHIC REMEDY.\r\n\r\nThe Osteopath will govern sensory and motor nerves by digital\r\nsuspension of the abnormal irritability of the sensory nerves on the\r\nvarious parts of the spine as indicated by the disease.\r\n\r\nHe uses no injections for the bowels for the reason that the necessary\r\nfluids naturally flow into the bowels to lubricate and quiet, and\r\nproceed at once to repair all irritated surfaces, which is abundantly\r\nsupplied by nature from the mouth of the sphincter ani, without which\r\nforethought and preparation, nature's God will prove his incompetency\r\nfor the great battle of life.\r\n\r\nYou administer medicines from the chemistry of the arts by mouth,\r\ninjection and otherwise. We adjust the machinery and depend upon\r\nnature's chemical laboratory for all elements necessary to repair, give\r\nease and comfort, while nature's corpuscles do all the work necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE BLOOD.\r\n\r\n     Uses for Fluids--Blood an Unknown Fluid--Harvey Only Reached the\r\n     Banks of the River of Life--Blood Is Systematically\r\n     Furnished--Fatality of Ignorance--To Find the Cause Must Be\r\n     Honest--Following Arteries and Nerves--Feeding the Nerves--The\r\n     Blood on Its Journey--Powers Necessary to Move Blood--Venous Blood\r\n     Suspended.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES FOR FLUIDS.\r\n\r\nIf a thousand kinds of fluids exist in our bodies a thousand uses\r\nrequire their help, or they would not appear. Thus to know how and why\r\nthey help in the economy of life is the study of he who acts only when\r\nhe knows at what places each must appear, and fill the part and use for\r\nwhich it is designed. If the demand for a substance is absolute its\r\nchance to act and answer that call and obey such command must not be\r\nhindered while in preparation, nor on its journey to local destination,\r\nfor by its power all action may depend. Thus blood, albumen, gall,\r\nacids, alkalies, oils, brain fluid and other substances formed by\r\nassociations while in physiological processes of formation must be on\r\ntime in place and measured abundantly, that the biogenic laws of nature\r\ncan have full power with time to act, and material in abundance and of\r\nkinds to suit. Thus all things else may be in place in ample quantities\r\nand fail because the power is withheld and no action for want of brain\r\nfluids with its power to vivify all animated nature which have followed\r\nany fluid found in the body, and followed it from formation to use and\r\nexhaustion step by step until he knows what form a union with one or\r\nmany kinds. Thus we can do no more than feed and trust the laws of life\r\nas nature gives them to man. We must arrange our bodies in such true\r\nlines that ample nature can select and associate by its definite\r\nmeasures, weights and choices of kinds, that which can make all fluids\r\nneeded for our bodily uses, from the crude blood to the active flames of\r\nlife, as seen when marshalled for the duties of that stands and obey the\r\nedicts of the mind of the infinite.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLOOD AN UNKNOWN FLUID.\r\n\r\nBlood is an unknown red or black fluid, found inside of the human body,\r\nin tubes, channels or tunnels. What it is, how it is made, and what it\r\ndoes after it leaves the heart in the arteries, before it returns to the\r\nheart through the veins, is one of the mysteries of animal life. It has\r\nbeen tried to be analyzed to know of what it is composed, and when done,\r\nwe know but little more of what it really is, than we know what sulphur\r\nis made of. We know it is a colored fluid, and it is in all parts of the\r\nflesh and bone. We know it builds up heaps of flesh, but how, is the\r\nquestion that leads us to honor the unknowable law of life, by which it\r\ndoes the work of its mysterious construction of all forms found in the\r\nparts of man. In all our efforts to learn what it is, what it is made\r\nof, and what enters it as life and gives it the building powers with\r\nthat intelligence it displays in building, that we see in daily\r\nobservation, is to us such an incomprehensible wonder, that with the\r\n\"sacred writers\" we are constrained to say, Great is the mystery of\r\n\"Godliness.\" I dislike to say we know but very little about the blood,\r\n\"in fact, nothing at all,\" but such is the truth under oath. We cannot\r\nmake one drop of blood because of our ignorance of the laws of its\r\nproduction. If we knew what its components were, we would soon build\r\nlarge machinery, make and have blood for sale in quantities to suit the\r\npurchaser. But alas! we cannot with all the combined intelligence of\r\nman, make one drop of blood, because we do not know what it is. Then, as\r\nits production is by the skill of a foreigner whose education has grown\r\nto suit the work, we must silently sit by and willingly receive the work\r\nwhen handed out for use by the producer. At this point I will say that\r\nan intelligent Osteopath is willing to be governed by the immutable\r\nlaws of nature, and feel that he is justified to pass the fluid on from\r\nplace to place and trust results.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARVEY ONLY REACHED THE BANKS OF THE RIVER OF LIFE.\r\n\r\nWhen Harvey solved by his powers of reason a knowledge of the\r\ncirculation of the blood, he only reached the banks of the river of\r\nlife. He saw that the heads and mouths of the rivers of blood begin and\r\nend in the heart, to do the mysterious works of constructing man. Then\r\nhe went into camp and left this compound for other minds to speculate\r\non, of the how it was made, of what composed, and how it became a medium\r\nof life which sustains all beings. He saw the genius of nature had\r\nwritten its wisdom and will of life, by the red ink of all truth.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLOOD IS SYSTEMATICALLY FURNISHED.\r\n\r\nBlood is systematically furnished from the heart to all divisions of our\r\nbodies. When we go any course from the heart we will find one or more\r\narteries leaving heart. If we go toward the head, we find caroted,\r\ncervical and vertebral arteries in pairs, large enough to supply blood\r\nabundantly for bone, brain, and muscle. That blood builds all the brain,\r\nall the bone, nerves, muscles, glands, membranes, fascia and skin. Then\r\nwe see wisdom just as much in the venous system, as in the arterial.\r\nThus the arteries supply all demands, and the veins carry away all\r\nwaste material, with returning blood of veins. We find building and\r\nhealthy renovation are united in a perpetual effort to construct and\r\nsustain purity. In these two are the facts and truths of life and\r\nhealth. If we go to any other part or organ of the body, we find just\r\nthe same law of supply, arteries first, then renovation, beginning with\r\nthe veins. The rule of artery and vein is universal in all living\r\nbeings, and the Osteopath must know that, and abide by its rulings, or\r\nhe will not succeed as a healer. Place him in open combat with fevers of\r\nwinter or summer and he saves, or loses, his patients, just in\r\nproportion to his ability to sustain the artery to feed, and the veins\r\nto purify by taking away the dead substances before they ferment, in the\r\nlymphatics and cellular system. He shows just the same stupidity and\r\nignorance of support from arteries and purity by the veins when he fails\r\nto cure erysipelas, flux, pneumonia, croup, scarlet fever, diphtheria,\r\nmeasles, mumps, rheumatism, and on to all diseases of climate and\r\nseasons.\r\n\r\n\r\nFATALITY OF IGNORANCE.\r\n\r\nIt is ignorance and inattention to the arteries to supply and the veins\r\nto carry away all deposits before they form tumors in lungs, abdomen or\r\nany part of the system. Thus man's ignorance of how and why the blood\r\nrenovates and why tumors are formed, has allowed the knife to be found\r\nin the belts of so many doctors to-day. On this law Osteopathy has\r\nsuccessfully stood and cured more than any school of cures, and has\r\nsustained all its diplomates financially and otherwise. I write this\r\narticle on blood for the student of Osteopathy. I want him to put nature\r\nto a test of its merit, and know if it is a law equal to all demands. If\r\nnot, he is very much and seriously limited when he goes into war with\r\ndiseases. What is to be understood by \"Disease?\"[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: DISEASE. 1. \"Lack of ease. 2. An alteration in the state of\r\nthe body, or some of its organs, interrupting or disturbing the\r\nperformance of the vital functions and causing or threatening pain and\r\nweakness; malady; affection; illness; sickness; disease;\r\ndisorder.\"--Webster's International Dictionary.]\r\n\r\nWhen we use the word \"disease,\" we mean anything that makes an unnatural\r\nshowing in the body by pain, overgrowth of muscle; gland; organ;\r\nphysical pain; numbness; heat; cold; or anything that we find not\r\nnecessary to life and comfort. I have no wish to rob surgery of its\r\nuseful claims, and its scientific merits to suffering man and beast.\r\nSuch is not my object, but to place the Osteopath's eye of reason on the\r\nhunt of the great whys that the knife is useful at all, I am sure it\r\ncomes often to remove growths and diseased flesh and bone that have\r\ngotten so by man's ignorance of a few great truths. 1st, If blood is\r\nallowed to be taken to a gland or organ, and not taken away in due time\r\nthe accumulation will become bulky enough to stop the excretory nerves\r\nand cause local paralysis; then the nutrient nerves proceed to construct\r\ntumors, and on and on until there is no relief but the knife or death.\r\nHad this blood not been conveyed there, it would not be there at all,\r\neither in bulk or less quantities. Had it simply done its work and\r\npassed on we could have no material to grow such abnormal beings. If a\r\ntumefaction appears in one side, and not in the other, why so? and why\r\nis there no growth in one side the same as the other? It takes no great\r\neffort of mind to see that the veins did not receive and carry off the\r\nblood, and a growth was natural, as the condition could not do otherwise\r\nand be true to nature. Thus man's ignorance has made a condition for the\r\nknife. Had he taken the hint and let the blood pass on when its work was\r\ndone, he would not have to witness the guillotine of death to his\r\npatients, whose early pains told him a renal vein or some vessel below\r\nthe diaphragm was ligated by an impacted colon, or a few ribs pulling\r\nand bringing diaphragm down across vena cava and thoracic duct and\r\ncausing excitement or paralysis of solar plexus, or any other nerves\r\nthat pass through diaphragm with blood to and from heart and lungs.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO FIND THE CAUSE.\r\n\r\nHow to find causes of diseases or where a hindrance is located that\r\nstops blood is a great mental worry to the Osteopath when he is called\r\nto treat a patient. The patient tells him \"where he hurts,\" how much \"he\r\nhurts,\" how long \"he has hurt,\" how hot or cold he is. The doctor puts\r\nthis symptom and that symptom in a column, adds them up according to the\r\nlatest books on symptomatology, finally he is able to guess at some name\r\nto call the disease. Then he proceeds and treats as his pap's father\r\nheard his granny say their old family doctor treated \"them sort of\r\ndiseases in North Carolina.\" An Osteopath feels bad to have to hunt\r\ncause for diseases, and not know how to start out to find the mechanical\r\ncause. He feels that the people expect more than guessing of an\r\nOsteopath. He feels that he must put his hand on the cause and prove\r\nwhat he says by what he does, that he will not get off by the feeble\r\nminded trash of stale habits that go with doctors of medicine, and by\r\nhis knowledge he must show his ability to go beyond the musty bread of\r\nsymptomatology and water his patients made, from the cider of the ripe\r\napples from the tree of knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUST BE HONEST.\r\n\r\nAn Osteopath should be a clear-headed, conscientious, truth loving man,\r\nand never speak until he knows he has found and can demonstrate the\r\ntruth he claims to know.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOLLOWING ARTERIES AND NERVES.\r\n\r\nI understand anatomy and physiology after fifty years casual and close\r\nattention, the last twenty years being very continued and close\r\nattention to what has been said, by all the best writers whom I have\r\nperused, many of whom are considered standard guides for the student and\r\npractitioner to be governed by. I have dissected and witnessed the very\r\nbest anatomists that the world affords dissect. I have followed the\r\nknife after arteries through the whole distribution of blood of arterial\r\nsystems, to the great and small vessels, until the lenses of the most\r\npowerful microscopes seemed to exhaust their ability to perceive the\r\ntermination of the artery; with the same care following the knife and\r\nmicroscope from nerve center to terminals of the large to the infinitely\r\nsmall fibers around which those fine nerve vines entwine. First like a\r\nbean entwining by way of the right around and up continuing to the\r\nright, and then turn my microscope to the entwining of another set of\r\nnerves which is to the left universally as the hop. Those nerves are\r\nsolid, cylindrical and stratified in form, with many leading from the\r\nlymphatics to the artery, and to the red and white muscles, fascia,\r\ncellular-membrane, striated and unstriated organs, all connecting to and\r\ntraveling with the artery, and continuing with it through its whole\r\ncircuit from start to terminals.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEEDING THE NERVES.\r\n\r\nLike a thirsty herd of camels, the whole nerve system, sensory, motor,\r\nnutrient, voluntary and involuntary; this herd of sappers or hungry\r\nnerves seems to be in sufficient quantities and numbers to consume all\r\nblood and cause the philosopher to ask the question: \"Is not the labor\r\nof the artery complete when it has fed the hungry nerves?\" Is he not\r\njustified in the conclusion that the nerves do gestate and send forth\r\nall substances that are applied by nature in the construction of man? If\r\nthis philosophy be true, then he who arms himself for the battles of\r\nOsteopathy when combating diseases, has a guide and a light whereby he\r\ncan land safely in port from every voyage.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLOOD ON ITS JOURNEY.\r\n\r\nTurn the eye of reason to the heart and observe the blood start on its\r\njourney. It leaves in great haste and never stops even in the smaller\r\narteries. It is all in motion and very quick and powerful at all\r\nplaces. Its motion indicates no evidence of construction even supposable\r\nduring such time, but we can find in the lymphatics, cells or pockets,\r\nmotion slow enough to suppose that in such cells, living beings can be\r\nformed and carried to their places by the lymphatics for the purposes\r\nthey must fill, as bone, or muscle. Let us reason that blood has a great\r\nand universal duty to perform, if it constructs, nourishes, and keeps\r\nthe whole nerve system normal in form and function.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOWERS NECESSARY TO MOVE BLOOD.\r\n\r\nAs blood and other fluids of life are ponderable bodies of different\r\nconsistences, and are moved through the system to construct, purify,\r\nvitalize and furnish power necessary to keep the machinery in action, we\r\nmust reason on the different powers necessary to move those bodies\r\nthrough arteries, veins, ducts, over nerves, spongy membranes, fascia,\r\nmuscles, ligaments, glands and skin; and judge from their unequal\r\ndensity, and adjust force to meet the demand according to kinds, to be\r\nsent to and from all parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nVENOUS BLOOD SUSPENDED.\r\n\r\nSuppose venous blood to be suspended by cold or other causes in the\r\nlungs to the amount of oedema of the fascia, another mental look would\r\nsee the nerves of the fascia of the lungs in a high state of\r\nexcitement, cramping fascia on veins which is bound to stop flow of\r\nblood to heart. No blood can pass through a vein that is closed by\r\nresistance, nor can it ever do it until resistance is suspended. Thus\r\nthe cause of nerve irritation must be found and removed before the\r\nchannels can relax and open sufficiently to admit the passage of the\r\nfluids being obstructed. And in order to remove this obstructing cause,\r\nwe must go to the nerve supply of the lungs, or any other part of the\r\nbody, and direct our attention to the cause of the nerve excitement, and\r\nthat only; and prosecute the investigation to a finish. If the breathing\r\nbe too fast and hurried, address your attention to the motor nerves,\r\nthen to the sensory, for through them you regulate and reduce the\r\nexcitement of the motor nerves of the arteries. As soon as sensation is\r\nreduced the motor and sensory circuit is completed and the labor of the\r\nartery is less, because of venous resistance having been removed. The\r\ncircuit of electricity is complete as proven by the completed arterial\r\nand venous circuit for the reduction of motor irritation. The high\r\ntemperature disappears because distress gives place to the normal, and\r\nrecovery is the result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE FASCIA.\r\n\r\n     Where Is Disease Sown?--An Illustration of Conception--The Greatest\r\n     Problem--A Fountain of Supply--Fascia Omnipresent--Connection with\r\n     Spinal Cord--Goes With and Covers All Muscles--Proofs in\r\n     Contagion--Study of Nerves and Fascia--Tumefy--Tumefaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE DISEASE IS SOWN.\r\n\r\nDisease is evidently sown as atoms of gas fluids, or solids. A suitable\r\nplace is necessary first to deposit the active principle of life, be\r\nthat what it may. Then a responsive kind of nourishment must be obtained\r\nby the being to be developed. Thus we must find in animals that part of\r\nthe body that can assist by action and by qualified food to develop the\r\nbeing in foetal life. Reason calls the mind to the rule of man's\r\ngestative life first, and as a basis of thought, we look at the\r\nquickening atom, the coming being, when only by the aid of a powerful\r\nmicroscope can we see the vital germ. It looks like an atom of white\r\nfibrin or detached particle of fascia. It leaves one parent as an atom\r\nof fascia, and to live and grow, must dwell among friendly surroundings,\r\nand be fed by such food as contains albumen, fibrin and lymph; also the\r\nnerve generating power and qualities, as it then and there begins to\r\nconstruct a suitable form in which to live and flourish. And as the\r\nfascia is the best suited with nerves, blood, and white corpuscles, it\r\nis but reasonable to look for the part that is composed of the greatest\r\nper cent of fascia, and expect it, the germ, to dwell there for support\r\nand growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ILLUSTRATION OF CONCEPTION.\r\n\r\nWhen you follow the germ from father until it has left his system of\r\nfascia, we find it flourishing in the womb, which organ is almost a\r\ncomplete being of itself. The center, origin, and mother of all fascias.\r\nIt there dwells and grows to birth, and appears as a completed being, a\r\nproduct of the life giving powers of the fascia.\r\n\r\nWith this foundation established we think we prove conception, growth,\r\nand cause of all diseases to be in the fascia.\r\n\r\nAs this philosophy has chosen the fascia as a foundation on which to\r\nstand, we hope the reader will chain his patience for a few minutes on\r\nthe subject of the fascia, and its relation to vitality. It stands\r\nbefore the philosopher as one of, if not the deepest living problems\r\never brought before the mind of man.\r\n\r\nWe will ask your attention in the attached effort to describe the fascia\r\nat greater length: It being that principle that sheathes, permeates,\r\ndivides and sub-divides every portion of all animal bodies; surrounding\r\nand penetrating every muscle and all its fibers--every artery, and every\r\nfiber and principle thereunto belonging, and grows more wonderful as\r\nyour eye is turned upon the venous system with its great company of\r\nlymphatics, which supplies the water of life, used to reduce too heavily\r\nthickened blood of the veins, as it approaches the heart on its journey,\r\nto be renewed after purification and thrown back into the arteries to\r\npatrol, nourish and supply from headquarters to the videts of this great\r\nmoving army of life, the substance of which we are now speaking.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREATEST PROBLEM.\r\n\r\nThe fascia is universal in man and equal in self to all other parts, and\r\nstands before the world to-day the greatest problem, the most pleasing\r\nthought. It carries to the mind of the philosopher the evidence,\r\nabsolute, that it is the \"material man,\" and the dwelling place his of\r\nspiritual being. It is the house of God, the dwelling place of the\r\nInfinite so far as man is concerned. It is the fort which the enemy of\r\nlife takes by conquest through disease and winds up the combat and\r\nplaces thereon the black flag of \"no quarters.\" That enemy is sure to\r\ncapture all forts known as human beings at some time, although the\r\nengagement may last for many years. Procrastination of surrender can\r\nonly be obtained by giving timely support to the supply of nourishment,\r\nwith an unobstructed condition, kept up in favor of the nerves\r\ninterested in the renewal of the human system, that powerful life force\r\nthat is bequeathed to man and all other beings, and acts through the\r\nfascia of man and beast.\r\n\r\n\r\nA FOUNTAIN OF SUPPLY.\r\n\r\nThe fascia gives one of, if not the greatest problems to solve as to the\r\npart it takes in life and death. It belts each muscle, vein, nerve, and\r\nall organs of the body. It is almost a network of nerves, cells and\r\ntubes, running to and from it; it is crossed and filled with, no doubt,\r\nmillions of nerve centers and fibers to carry on the work of secreting\r\nand excreting fluid vital and destructive. By its action we live, and by\r\nits failure we shrink, or swell, and die. Each muscle plays its part in\r\nactive life. Each fiber of all muscles owes its pliability to that\r\nyielding septum-washer, that gives all muscles help to glide over and\r\naround all adjacent muscles and ligaments, without friction or jar. It\r\nnot only lubricates the fibers but gives nourishment to all parts of\r\nthe body. Its nerves are so abundant that no atom of flesh fails to get\r\nnerve and fluid supply therefrom.\r\n\r\n\r\nFASCIA OMNIPRESENT.\r\n\r\nThis life is surely too short to solve the uses of the fascia in animal\r\nforms. It penetrates even its own finest fibers to supply and assist its\r\ngliding elasticity. Just a thought of the completeness and universality\r\nin all parts, even though you turn the visions of your mind to follow\r\nthe infinitely fine nerves. There you see the fascia, and in your wonder\r\nand surprise, you exclaim, \"Omnipresent in man and all other living\r\nbeings of the land and sea.\"\r\n\r\nOther great questions come to haunt the mind with joy and admiration,\r\nand we can see all the beauties of life on exhibition by that great\r\npower with which the fascia is endowed. The soul of man with all the\r\nstreams of pure living water seems to dwell in the fascia of his body.\r\n\r\nDoes it not throw hot shot and shells of thought into man's famishing\r\nchamber of reason; to feel that he has seen by thought the frame work of\r\nlife the dwelling place on which life sojourns? He feels that he can\r\nfind all disturbing causes of life, the place that diseases germinate\r\nand grow, the seeds of disease and death.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONNECTION WITH THE SPINAL CORD.\r\n\r\nAs life finds its general nutrient law in the fascia and its nerves, we\r\nmust connect them to the great source of supply by a cord running the\r\nlength of the spine, by which all nerves are supplied by the brain. The\r\ncord throws out and supplies millions of nerves by which all organs and\r\nparts are supplied with the elements of motion, all go to and terminate\r\nin that great system, the fascia.\r\n\r\nAs we dip our cups deeper and deeper into the ocean of thought we feel\r\nthat the solution of life and health is close to the field of the\r\ntelescope of our mental search lights, and soon we will find the road to\r\nhealth so plainly written that the wayfaring man cannot err though he be\r\na fool.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOES WITH AND COVERS ALL MUSCLES.\r\n\r\nAs the student of anatomy explores the subject under his knife and\r\nmicroscope he easily finds this membrane goes with and covers all\r\nmuscles, tendons and fibers, and separates them even to the least fiber.\r\nAll organs have a covering of this substance, though they may have names\r\nto suit the organs, surfaces or parts spoken of.\r\n\r\nWe write much of the universality of the fascia to impress the reader\r\nwith the idea that this connecting substance must be free at all parts\r\nto receive and discharge all fluids, if healthy to appropriate and use\r\nin sustaining animal life, and eject all impurities that health may not\r\nbe impaired by the dead and poisoning fluids. Thus a knowledge of the\r\nuniversal extent of the fascia is almost imperative, and is one of the\r\ngreatest aids to the person who seeks cause of disease. He of all men\r\nshould know more of the fascia, and when disease is local or general.\r\nThat the fascia and its nerves demand his attention first, and on his\r\nknowledge of the same, much of his success, and the life of his patients\r\ndo depend.\r\n\r\nWill the student of Osteopathy stop just a moment and see his medical\r\ncotemporary plow the skin with the needle of his hypodermic syringe. He\r\ndrives it into and unloads his morphine and other poisonous drugs under\r\nthe skin, and into the very center of the nerves of the superficial\r\nfascia. He produces paralysis of all nerves by this method, just as\r\ncertainly as if he had put his poison in the cerebellum, but not so\r\ncertain to produce instantaneous death as to unload in the brain. But if\r\nhe is faithfully ignorant, he will kill just as certainly at one place\r\nas the other, because the poisonous effects can be easily taken to every\r\nfiber of the whole body by the nerves and fibers of the fascia.\r\n\r\nWhen you deal with the fascia you deal and do business with the branch\r\noffices of the brain, and under the general corporation law, the same as\r\nthe brain itself, and why not treat it with the same degree of respect?\r\n\r\nThe doctor of medicine does effectual work through the medium of the\r\nfascia. Why not you relax, contract, stimulate and clean the whole\r\nsystem of all diseases by that willing and sufficient power to renovate\r\nall parts of the system, from deadly compounds that generate through\r\ndelay and stagnation of fluids while in the fascia.\r\n\r\nOur school is young, but the laws that govern life are as old as the\r\nhours of all ages. We may find much that has never been written nor\r\npracticed before, but all such discoveries are truths born with the\r\nbirth of eternity, old as God and as true as life.\r\n\r\nThe difference between a philosopher and a less powerful thinker is one\r\nobserves alone, and depends on his own powers of mind to arrive at\r\ntruth. Another lacks self confidence and mental energy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROOFS IN CONTAGION.\r\n\r\nIf disease is so highly attenuated, so etherial, and penetrable in\r\nquality, and multiple in atoms; and a breath of air two quarts or more\r\ntaken into the lungs fully charged with contagion, how many thousand air\r\ncells could be impregnated by one single breath? Say we take a case of\r\nmeasles into a schoolroom of sixty pupils, in a warm and poorly\r\noxygenized atmosphere all day, would not the living gas thrown off from\r\nactive measles enter and irritate the air cells and close the most\r\nirritable cells with the poisonous gas retained for active development\r\nin those womb-like departments in the lungs.\r\n\r\nNow you have the seeds in thousands of cells, which are as vital and\r\nwell supplied by nerves and blood as the womb itself. Would not reason\r\nsee the development of millions more of the vital beings who get their\r\nnourishment from the vitality found in the human fascia, which comes\r\nnearer to the surface in the lungs than in any part of the system,\r\nexcept it be the womb.\r\n\r\nIn proof of the certainty of measles being taken up by the lungs at one\r\nbreath and caught by the secretions and conveyed to the universal system\r\nof fascia to develop the contagion, I will give the case of one of my\r\nboys who was sick with cold as I supposed; watering of eyes, cough,\r\nfever and headache. He was in the country about eight miles from home,\r\nand on our return stopped to get his books at a small school house. He\r\nran in, picked up his books that were lying upon the desk, walked the\r\nlength of the room which was about forty feet, was not there over\r\none-half minute and in just nine days forty-two children broke out with\r\nmeasles. So certain is contagion to be taken up by the nerves and\r\nvitalizing fluids of the fascia.\r\n\r\nIt seems that all the fascia needs to develop anything is to have the\r\nseed planted in its arms for construction, the work will be done,\r\nlabeled, and handed out for inspection by the inspectors of all works.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDY OF NERVES AND FASCIA.\r\n\r\nWe must remember as we reason on the power of life which is located in\r\nthe fascia, that it occupies the whole body, and should we find a local\r\nregion that is disordered and wish to, we can relieve that part through\r\nthat local plexus of nerves which controls that organ and division. Thus\r\nyour attention should be directed to all nerves of that part. Sensory,\r\nto modify sensation, blood must not be let run to the part by wild\r\nmotion, its flow must be gentle to suit the demands of nutrition,\r\notherwise weakness takes the place of strength, then we lose the\r\nbenefits of the nerves of nutrition, by which strength of all systems of\r\nforce are kept in action during life.\r\n\r\nSuppose the nerves that supply the lungs with motion should stop, the\r\nlungs would stop also; suppose they should half stop, the lungs would\r\nsurely half stop. Now we must reason, if we succeed in relieving lungs,\r\nthat all kinds of nerves are found in them. The lungs move, thus you\r\nfind motor; they have feeling, thus the sensory; they grow by nutrition,\r\n(thus the nutrient nerves;) they move by will, or without it; they have\r\na voluntary and involuntary system; they move in sleep by the\r\ninvoluntary system.\r\n\r\nThe blood supply comes under the motor system of nerves, and delivers at\r\nproper places for the convenience of the nerves of nutrition. The\r\nsensory nerves limit the supply of arterial blood to the quantity\r\nnecessary, as the construction is going on by each successive stroke of\r\nthe heart. They limit the action of the lungs, receive and expel air in\r\nquantities sufficient to keep up purity of the blood, etc. With this\r\nfoundation we observe if too great action of the motor nerves, shows by\r\nbreathing too often to be normal, we are admonished to reduce breathing\r\nby addressing attention to the sensory nerves of lungs, in order that\r\nthe blood may pass through the veins, whose irritability has refused to\r\nreceive the blood, farther than arterial terminals. So soon as sensation\r\nis reduced relaxation of nerve fibers of veins tolerates the passage of\r\nvenous blood, which is deposited in the spongy portions of the lungs in\r\nsuch quantities as to overcome the activity of the nerves of renovation\r\nthat accompanies the fascia in its process of ejection of all fluids\r\nthat have been detained an abnormal time, first in the region of the\r\nfascia, then in the arterial and venous circulation. Thus you see what\r\nmust be done. The veins as channels must carry away all blood as soon as\r\nit has deposited its nutrient supplies to the places for which it is\r\nconstructed, otherwise, by delay vitality by asphyxia is lost to the\r\nblood which calls a greater force of the arterial pumps to drive the\r\nblood through the parts, ruptures its capillaries and deposits the blood\r\nin the mucous membrane; until nerves of the fascia becomes powerless by\r\nsurrounding pressure, which causes through the sensory nerves an\r\nirritability at the heart, which puts in force all its powers of motion.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUMEFY, TUMEFACTION.\r\n\r\nWebster's definition of tumefaction is to swell by any fluids or solids\r\nbeing detained abnormally at any place in the body.\r\n\r\nThe location may be in, or on any part of the system. No part is exempt;\r\neven the brain, heart, lungs, liver, stomach and bowels, bladder,\r\nkidneys, uterus, lymphatics, glands, nerves, veins, arteries, skin and\r\nall membranes are subject to swellings locally or generally, and with\r\nequal certainty they perish and shrink away. If either condition should\r\nexist death to the parts or all of the body will occur from want of\r\nnutrition. Instance, in lung fever which begins when swelling is\r\nestablished in lymphatics of lungs, trachea, nostrils, throat and face.\r\nAt once you see the pressure on the nerve fibers compressed to such\r\ndegree that they cannot operate excretories of lungs or any part of the\r\npulmonary, system. Veins, suspended by irritation of the nerves,\r\narteries are excited to fever heat in action with increase of\r\ntumefaction. A tumefying condition undoubtedly marks the beginning of\r\nall catarrhal diseases. Its ravages extend to the diseases of the fall\r\nand winter seasons. They are so marked on examination that the most\r\nskeptical cannot dispute or doubt the truth of this position. In fact he\r\nis already committed to a belief that there is something in the fluids\r\nthat he must purify by the chemical process of drugs.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICAL DOCTOR'S TREATMENT.\r\n\r\nHe looks on, and treats winter diseases with powerful purgatives,\r\nsweats, blisters, hot and cold applications with a view to remove\r\ncongesting fluids. He is not very certain which team of medical power he\r\ncan depend on. He hitches up many kinds of drugs hoping that a few of\r\nthem may be able to carry the burden. He bridles his horses with opium,\r\nloads them down with purgative powders, and whips them through with\r\ncastor oil, and for fear they will not travel fast enough he uses as a\r\nspur a delicately formed instrument known as the hypodermic syringe. He\r\npunches and prods until his horses fall exhausted. Disease and death\r\nshould give him a large pension for the assistance he has rendered in\r\ntheir service. All is guess work whose father and mother are \"Tradition\r\nand Ignorance.\" Ignorance of the kind that is wholly inexcusable to\r\nanyone but a medical doctor. An Osteopath who does not understand the\r\ngeneral law of tumefaction of the whole system is not excusable from the\r\nfact that tumefaction, disease and death are so plainly written on the\r\nface of all diseases that the blind need not have eyes to see, nor the\r\nphilosopher any brain to enable him to know this foundation is the\r\nhighest known truth of all man's intellectual possessions. Thus by the\r\nlaw of tumefaction, death can and does succumb to its indomitable will.\r\nObservations without record will show any fair minded person that\r\ntumefaction does cause death in the majority of cases. But another power\r\nis equally as effective in destruction of life which is just the reverse\r\nof tumefaction. It destroys by withholding nutrition and all of the\r\nfluids; the effect is starvation, shrinkage and death. Thus you see it\r\nis equally certain in results. In the one case death ensues from an\r\noverplus of unappropriated fluids of nutrition, in the other there is no\r\nappropriation to sustain animal life and the patient dies from\r\nstarvation. The same law holds good in the parts as well as in the whole\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nFEVERS.\r\n\r\n     Be Armed With Facts--Union of Human Gases With Oxygen--Fever and\r\n     Nettle-rash. Nature Constructs for a Wise Purpose--Processes of\r\n     Life Must be Kept in Motion--No Satisfaction from Authors--Animal\r\n     Heat--Semeiology--Symptomatology--Definition of Fever--Fevers only\r\n     Effects--Result of Stoppages of Vein or Artery--Aneurisms.\r\n\r\n\r\nBE ARMED WITH FACTS.\r\n\r\nWhen we reason for causes we must begin with facts, and hold them\r\nconstantly in line for action, and use, all the time. It would be good\r\nadvice never to enter a contest without your saber is of the purest\r\nsteel of reason. By such only can you cut your way to the magazine of\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nAs we line up to learn something of the cause of fever, we are met by\r\nheat, a living fact. Does that put the machinery of your mind in motion?\r\nIf not, what will arouse your mental energy? You see that heat is not\r\nlike cold. It is not a horse with eyes, head, neck, body, limbs and\r\ntail; but it is as much of a being as the horse; it is a being of heat.\r\nIf cause made the horse, and cause made the heat, why not devote all\r\nenergy in seeking for cause in all disturbances of life?\r\n\r\n\r\nUNION OF HUMAN GASES WITH OXYGEN.\r\n\r\nWho says heat is not a union of the human gases with oxygen and other\r\nsubstances as they pass out of the excretory system. By what force do\r\nparts of the engine of life move? If by the motor power of electricity,\r\nhow fast must the heart or life current run to ignite the gasolene of\r\nthe body and set a person on fire and burn to fever heat?\r\n\r\nIf we know anything of the laws of electricity, we must know velocity\r\nmodulates its temperature. Thus heat and cold are the effect.\r\n\r\nIf we understand anatomy as we should, we know man is the greatest\r\nengine ever produced, complete in form, an electro-magnet, a motor, and\r\nwould be incomplete if it could not burn its own gases.\r\n\r\nWhen man, is said to have fever, he is only on \"fire,\" to burn out the\r\ndeadly gases, which a perverted, dirty, abnormal, laboratory, has\r\nallowed to accumulate by friction of the journals of his body, or in the\r\nsupply of vital fluids. We are only complete when normal in all\r\nparts,--a true compass points to the normal only.\r\n\r\nWhen reasoning on the fever subject would it not be strictly in line to\r\nsuppose that the lowest perceptible grade of fever requires a less\r\nadditional physical energy to remove some foreign body from the person,\r\nthat at first would naturally show a very light effect upon the human\r\nsystem, which would be the effect of itchy sensation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEVER AND NETTLE-RASH.\r\n\r\nLet us stop and reason. Might this effect (itching) not come from\r\nobstructed gases that flow through and from the skin? If gas should be\r\ndetained in the system by the excretory ducts the substance closing the\r\nporous system would cause irritation of nerves, and increase the heart's\r\naction to such degree that the temperature is raised to fever heat, by\r\nthe velocity with which electricity is brought into action. Electricity\r\nbeing the force that is naturally required to contract muscles and force\r\ngases from the body.\r\n\r\nLet us advance higher in the scale of foreign bodies until we arrive to\r\nthe condition of steam, which is more dense than gas. Would it not take\r\nmore force to discharge it? By the same rule of reasoning we find water\r\nto be much thicker as an element than either gas or steam.\r\n\r\nThen we have lymph as another element, albumen, fibrin, with all the\r\nelements found in arterial and venous blood, all of which forces\r\nrequired to circulate, pass through and out of the system, must be\r\nincreased to suit. Therefore we are brought to this conclusion, that the\r\ndifferent degrees of temperature do mark the density of the fluids with\r\nwhich the motor engine has to contend.\r\n\r\nIf gas produces an itching sensation, would it not be reasonable to\r\nsuppose that the consistence of lymph would cause elevations on the\r\nskin, such as nettle-rash.\r\n\r\nIf this method of reasoning sustains us thus far, why not argue that\r\nalbumen obstructed while in the system of the fascia would require a\r\nmuch greater force to put it through the skin. The excretions of the\r\nbody would cause a much greater heat to even throw the albumen as far as\r\nthe cuticle.\r\n\r\nIf a greater, with a greater velocity, why not grant to this as cause of\r\nthe disturbance of motor energy equal to measles. Let us add to this\r\nalbumen a quantity of fibrin, have we not cause to expect the energy\r\nhereby required to be equal to that nerve and blood energy found in\r\nsmallpox?\r\n\r\nIf this be true, have we not a foundation in truth on which to base our\r\nconclusions? That the difference in forces manifested is the resistance\r\noffered by the difference in the consistence of devitalized fluids which\r\nthe nerves and fibers of the fascia labor to excrete.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE CONSTRUCTS TO SUIT A WISE PURPOSE.\r\n\r\nBy close observation the philosopher who is hunting to acquaint himself\r\nwith the laws of cause and effect, finds upon his voyages as an\r\nexplorer, that nature as cause does construct for wise purposes; and\r\nshows as much wisdom in the construction and preparation of all bodies,\r\nbeings and worlds, as the workings of those beings show when in action.\r\n\r\nAs life, the highest known principle sent forth by nature to vivify,\r\nconstruct and govern all beings, it is expected to be the indweller and\r\noperator, and one of the greatest perceivable and universal laws of\r\nnature. And when it becomes necessary to break the friendly relation\r\nbetween life and matter, nature closes up the channels of supply.\r\n\r\nIt may begin its work near the heart, at the origin of the greatest\r\nblood vessels, or do its work at any point. It may begin its closing\r\nprocess at the extremities of the veins or anywhere where exhausted\r\nvital fluids may enter for return to the heart for renewal by union with\r\nnew material.\r\n\r\nAs nature is never satisfied with incompleteness in anything, all\r\ninterferences from whatsoever cause are sufficient for nature to call a\r\nhalt and begin the work of excavation by bringing the necessary fluids,\r\nalready prepared in the chemical laboratory, to dissolve and wash away\r\nall obstructing deposits previous to beginning the work of\r\nreconstruction, which is to repair all injured parts of the machinery\r\nif disabled by atmospheric cause, poisons, or otherwise.\r\n\r\nWhen nature renovates it is never satisfied to leave any obstruction in\r\nany part of the body. All the powers of its battery force are brought in\r\nline to do duty, and never stop short of completeness which ends in\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nAll seasons of the year come and go, and we see year in and out the\r\nperpetual processes of construction of one class of bodies, and the\r\npassing away of others.\r\n\r\nVegetation builds forests, and cold builds mountains of ice to be\r\ndissolved and sent into the ocean to purify the water, and keep the\r\nbrines from drying to powder, as salt.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCESSES OF LIFE MUST BE KEPT IN MOTION.\r\n\r\nAll the processes of earth-life, must be kept in perpetual motion to\r\ncultivate and be kept in healthy condition, or the world would wither\r\nand die, and go to the tombs of space, to join the funeral procession of\r\nother dead worlds. Thus you see all nature comes and goes by the fiat of\r\nwisely adjusted laws.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO SATISFACTION FROM AUTHORS.\r\n\r\nRead all the authors from Æsculapius to this date, and all combined\r\nleave the inquirers without a single fact as to the cause or causes of\r\nfever.\r\n\r\nOne says fever may come from too much carbon. Another says chemical\r\ndefects may be the cause.\r\n\r\nI would like to agree with some of the good men of our date or the\r\nancient theorists if I could, but they, both dead and alive, are a blank\r\nexcept the tons of paper they have covered all over with conjectures,\r\nand closed out by the words \"Perhaps so's and howevers\" spoken in all\r\ntongues and languages on earth.\r\n\r\nAll have explored for centuries for the cause of fevers, and on return\r\nfrom their multiple voyages say, we hope some day to find the cause. We\r\nhave killed many dogs experimenting, but have failed to find the cause\r\nof fever.\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMAL HEAT.\r\n\r\nTo think of fever, we think of animal heat. By habit we want to know how\r\ngreat the heat is. We measure by a yard stick till we find we have 100°,\r\n102°, 104°, to 106°, at this point we stop as we find too many yards of\r\nred calico to suit the size of the purse of life. Which we think cannot\r\nconsume more than 106 yards of heat. We begin to ask for the substances\r\nthat are more powerful than fire. We try all known fire compounds and\r\nfail. The fire department had done faithful work, and all it could bring\r\nto bear on the fire. It had put on hose and steam, knocked shingles off\r\nand windows out, but not until the fire had ruined the house with all\r\nits inside and outside usefulness and beauties. Another and another\r\nhouse gets on fire and burns just as the first did. All are content to\r\nsee the ruins and say it is the will of the Lord; never thinking for a\r\nmoment that it was with the aid of the heart that the brain burned up\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\nOf what use is a knowledge of anatomy to man if he overlooks cause and\r\neffect in the results obtained by the machinery that anatomy should\r\nteach? He finds each part connected to all others with the wisdom that\r\nhas given a set of plans and specifications that are without a flaw or\r\nomission. The body generates its own heat and modulates to suit climate\r\nand season. It can generate through its electro-motor system far beyond\r\nthe kindly normal, to the highest known fever heat, and is capable of\r\nmodulations far above or below normal. A knowledge of Osteopathy will\r\nprepare you to bring the system under the rulings of the physical laws\r\nof life. Fever is electric heat only.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEMEIOLOGY.\r\n\r\n(Med.) The science of the signs or symptoms of disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMATOLOGY.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of symptoms; that part of the science of medicine which\r\ntreats of the symptoms of disease. Semeiology.\r\n\r\nThese definitions are from Webster's International Dictionary,\r\nconsidered by all English speaking people as a standard authority. Both\r\nwords are chosen names to represent that system of guess work, which is\r\nnow and has been used as a method of ascertaining what disease is or\r\nmight be. It is supposed to be the best method known to date to classify\r\nor name diseases, after which guessing begins in earnest. What kinds of\r\npoisons, how much and how often to use them, and guess how much good or\r\nhow much harm is being done to the sick person.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate more forcibly, to the mind of the reader that such system\r\nthough honored by age is only worthy the name of guess work, as shown by\r\nthe following standard authority on fevers:\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTTER'S DEFINITION OF FEVER.\r\n\r\n\"Fever is a condition in which there are present the phenomena of rise\r\nof temperature, quickened circulation, marked tissue change, and\r\ndisordered secretions.\r\n\r\n\"The primary cause of the fever phenomena is still a mooted (discussed\r\nand debated) question, and is either a disorder of the sympathetic\r\nnervous system giving rise to disturbances of the vaso-motor filaments,\r\nor a derangement of the nerve centers located adjacent to the corpus\r\nstriatum, which have been found, by experiment, to govern the processes\r\nof heat production, distribution, and dissipation.\r\n\r\n\"Rise of temperature is the pre-eminent feature of all fevers, and can\r\nonly be positively determined by the use of the clinical thermometer.\r\nThe term feverishness is used when the temperature ranges from 99° to\r\n100° fahr.; slight fever if 100° or 101°; moderate, 102° or 103°; high\r\nif 104° or 105° and intense if it exceed the latter. The term\r\nhyperpyrexia is used when the temperature shows a tendency to remain at\r\n106° fahr. and above.\r\n\r\n\"Quickened circulation is the rule in fevers, the frequency usually\r\nmaintaining a fair ratio with the increase of the temperature. A rise of\r\none degree fahr. is usually attended with an increase of eight to ten\r\nbeats of the pulse per minute.\r\n\r\n\"The following table gives a fair comparison between temperature and\r\npulse:--\r\n\r\n   TABLE OF DEGREES.\r\n\r\n   A temperature of 98° corresponds to a pulse of 60°\r\n          \"         99°       \"      \"      \"     70°\r\n          \"        100°F      \"      \"      \"     80°\r\n          \"        101°F      \"      \"      \"     90°\r\n          \"        102°F      \"      \"      \"    100°\r\n          \"        103°F      \"      \"      \"    110°\r\n          \"        104°F      \"      \"      \"    120°\r\n          \"        105°F      \"      \"      \"    130°\r\n          \"        106°F      \"      \"      \"    140°\r\n\r\n\"The tissue waste is marked in proportion to the severity and duration\r\nof the febrile phenomena, being slight or (nil) in febricula, and\r\nexcessive in typhoid fever.\r\n\r\n\"The disordered secretions are manifested by the deficiency in the\r\nsalivary, gastric, intestinal, and nephritic secretions, the tongue\r\nbeing furred, the mouth clammy, and there occurring anorexia, thirst,\r\nconstipation, and scanty, high-colored acid urine.\"[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: What has the student gained by reading the above definition\r\nof this standard author and representative of present medical attainment\r\nbut a labored effort to explain what he does not know.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFEVERS ONLY EFFECTS.\r\n\r\nFevers are effects only. The cause may be far from mental conclusions.\r\nIf we have a house with one bell, and ten wires each fastened to a door\r\nrunning to the center, all having wire connection and so arranged that\r\nto pull any one wire will set the bell in motion, and without an\r\nindicator you cannot tell which wire is disturbed, producing the effect\r\nor ringing of the bell at the center. An electrician would know at once\r\nthe cause, but to discriminate and locate the wire disturbed is the\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nBefore a bell can be heard from any door, the general battery must be\r\ncharged. Thus you see but one source of supply. To better illustrate--we\r\nwill take a house with eight rooms, and all supplied by one battery--one\r\nis a reception room, one a parlor, one a sitting room, one bed room,\r\none cloak room, one dining room, one a kitchen, and one a basement room,\r\nall having wires and bells running to one bell in the clerk's office,\r\nwhich has an indicator for each room by numbers on its face. If the\r\nmachinery is in good order he can call and answer correctly all the time\r\nand never make a mistake. But should he ring to call the cook and her\r\nbell keep on ringing and she and clerk could not stop it, and they\r\nsummon an electrician, what would you think if he began at the parlor\r\nbell to adjust a trouble of the kitchen bell? Surely you would not have\r\nhim treat the parlor bell first, because you know the cook could only\r\nanswer by the effect, or rattling of the office bell. Hers is cause,\r\nsound at office, effect. Now to apply this illustration, we will say a\r\nsystem of bells and connecting wires run to all parts or rooms of the\r\nbody, from the battery of power or the brain, conveyed by the strings of\r\nwires or nerves, that are put up and run to all active or vital parts of\r\nthe body. Thus arranged we see how blood is driven to any part of the\r\nsystem, by the power that is sent over the nerves from the brain to the\r\nspinal cord, and from there to all nerves of each and all divisions of\r\nthe body. Then your blood that has done its work in constructing parts\r\nor all of the system, entering veins to be returned to the heart for\r\nrenewal. Each vein, great and small, has nerves with them as servants\r\nof power, to force blood back to heart through the different sets of\r\ntubes known as veins, and made to suit the duties they have to perform\r\nin the process of life. As it travels to the heart with blood too thick\r\nto suit the lungs, the great system of lymphatics pour in water to suit\r\ndemands, preparatory to entering the lungs to be purified and renewed.\r\nThus you see nature has amply prepared all the machinery and power to\r\nprepare material and construct all parts, and when in normal condition\r\nthe mind and wisdom of God is satisfied that the machine will go on and\r\nbuild and run according to the plan and specification. If this be true\r\nas nature proves at every point and principle, what can man do farther\r\nthan plumb, line up, and trust to nature to get results desired, \"life\r\nand health?\" Can we add or suggest any improvement? If not, what is left\r\nfor us to do is to keep bells, batteries and wires in normal place and\r\ntrust to normal law as given by nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESULT OF STOPPAGE OF VEIN OR ARTERY.\r\n\r\nBut few questions remain to be asked by the philosophical navigator when\r\nhe sets sail to go to the cause of flux. Would he go to blood supply?\r\nCertainly, there must be supply previous to deposit. Reason would cause\r\nus to combine the fact that blood must be in perpetual motion from and\r\nto the heart during life, and that law is the fiat of all nature which\r\nis indispensable and absolute. Blood must not stop its motion nor be\r\nallowed to unduly deposit, as the heart's action is perpetual in motion.\r\nThe work is complete of the heart if it delivers blood into the\r\nexploring arteries. Each division must to do its part fully as a normal\r\nheart does, or can in the greatest measure of health; and a normally\r\nformed heart is just as much interested in the blood that is running\r\nconstantly for repairs and additions, as the whole system is on the\r\narteries for supply. Thus you must have perfection in shape first, and\r\nfrom it to all parts as far as an artery reaches. All hindrances must be\r\nkept away from the arteries great and small. Health permits of no\r\nstopping of blood in either the vein or artery. If an artery cannot\r\nunload its consents a strain follows, and as an artery must have room to\r\ndeposit its supplies it proceeds to build other vessels adjacent to the\r\npoints of obstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nANEURISMS.\r\n\r\nSome are builded to enormous sizes. We call them aneurisms or\r\naccommodation chambers, builded by nature's constructing ability of the\r\narteries as deposits for blood. The artery should pass farther on, thus\r\nyou by reason must know an obstruction has limited the flow of blood,\r\nand the tumor is only an effect, and obstruction is the cause of all\r\nabnormal deposits, either from vein or artery. Unobstructed blood cannot\r\nform a tumor, nor allow inharmony to dwell in any part of the system.\r\nFlux is an effect, blood supply and circulation both at variation from\r\nnormal. An artery finds veins of bowels irritated and contracted to such\r\ndegree that arterial blood cannot enter veins with cargo of blood at\r\nall, and deposits its blood at terminal points in mucous membrane of\r\nbowels, and when membrane fails to hold all blood so delivered, then the\r\nfirst blood which dies of asphyxia finds an outlet into the bowels to be\r\ncarried off and out by peristaltic actions. Thus you have a continuous\r\ndeposit and discharge for arterial blood until death stops the supply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nSCARLET FEVER AND SMALLPOX.\r\n\r\n     As defined by Allopathy--Scarlet Fever as Defined by\r\n     Osteopathy--Smallpox--Power to Drive Greater Than in Measles.\r\n\r\n\r\nAS DEFINED BY ALLOPATHY.\r\n\r\n\"Scarlet fever begins with a short period of tired feeling. A short\r\nperiod of chilly sensation, fullness of eyes and sore throat. In a few\r\nhours fever begins with great heat of back of head. It soon extends all\r\nover the body, sick stomach and vomiting generally accompany the\r\ndisease. Rash of a red color beginning on back, and extends to throat\r\nand limbs. About the second or third day, the fever is very high, from\r\n100° to 104° and generally lasts to fifth and seventh day, at which time\r\nfever begins to diminish, with itching over the body. The skin at this\r\ntime throws off all of the dead scales that had been red rash in the\r\nfore-part of the disease. Often the lining membranes of the mouth,\r\nthroat and tonsils slough and bleed. Also pus is often formed just under\r\nthe skin in front of the throat. Such cases usually die.[7]\r\n\r\n   ALLOPATHY.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Very true, if treated by the medicine man.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSCARLET FEVER AS DEFINED BY OSTEOPATHY.\r\n\r\nIs a disease generally of the early spring and late fall seasons.\r\nGenerally comes with cold and damp weathers during east winds. It begins\r\nwith sore throat, chilly and tired feelings, followed with headache and\r\nvomiting. In a few hours chilly feeling leaves and fever sets in very\r\nhigh, burns your hands. The patient is rounded in chest, abdomen, face\r\nand limbs by congestion of the fascia and all of the lymphatic glands.\r\nThis stagnation will soon begin its work of fermentation of the fluids\r\nof fascia, then you see the rash. If you do not want to see the rash and\r\nsloughing of throat, with a dead patient, I would advise you to train\r\nyour guns on the blood, nerves, and lymphatics of the fascia and stop\r\nthe cause at once, or quit.\r\n\r\n   OSTEOPATHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMALLPOX.\r\n\r\nIf we give a thought to the action of the electro-motor force, we would\r\nbe constrained to believe that a power that could drive gas through a\r\nbody of great density, would be much less than one that could force\r\nlymph through the same density. The same of albumen.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOWER TO DRIVE GREATER THAN IN MEASLES.\r\n\r\nThus in smallpox the motor energy must be equal to the force that would\r\nconvey albumen through all tissues. Measles would be less, and so on\r\naccording to the thickness of the fluids present. Thus you see the power\r\nto drive dead fluids from fascia must be much greater in smallpox than\r\nin cases of measles. Then we must see why the pulse of smallpox is so\r\npowerful during development of the pox. After killing the fluids by\r\nretention in the fascia of the skin, a greater force yet is created by\r\nhurting nerve fibers of fascia; then the motor energy appears and all\r\nthe powers of life go to help the arteries force fluids through the skin\r\nand push to and leave them in the fascia of the skin to be eliminated as\r\nbest it can. In some parts elimination fails, such places are called\r\npox. They supurate and drop out leaving a pit (the pox mark). Now had\r\nthe nerves of the skin and fascia not been irritated to contract the\r\nskin against the fascia passing its dead fluids through the excretory\r\nducts of the skin, we probably would have no eruption. It is not quite\r\nreasonable to conclude that after the heart overloads the fascia and the\r\nnerves lose their control by pressure of fluids, that all that is left\r\nis chemical action to the production of pus, which throws it out of\r\nfascia in intervening spaces? Then should the fascia have greater death\r\nof its substances, we have one spot to run into others, and we have\r\n\"confluent smallpox.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nA CHAPTER OF WONDERS AND SOME VALUABLE QUESTIONS.\r\n\r\n     Wonders on the Increase--What Is Life?--How Is Action\r\n     Produced--Acquaint Yourself With the Machinery--Duty of the\r\n     Osteopath--Formation of Sacrum--The Pelvis--Appearance of\r\n     OEdema--Do All Diseases Have Appearance in OEdema.\r\n\r\n\r\nWONDERS ON THE INCREASE.\r\n\r\nWonders are daily callers, and seem greatly on the increase during the\r\nEighteenth century. As we read history we learn that no one hundred\r\nyears of the past has produced wonders in such number and variety.\r\nStupid systems of government have given place to better and wiser.\r\nVoyages of the ocean have had months by sail reduced to days by steam.\r\nJourneys over land that would require six months by horse and ox, are\r\nnow accomplished in six days by rail. Our law, medical and other schools\r\nof five and seven years, are now but two or three; and the graduates of\r\nsuch schools are far superior in useful knowledge to those of the five\r\nand seven. And no wonder at that, for the facilities for giving the\r\npupil an education are so far superior that the knowledge sought, can be\r\nobtained in less time. Our schools are not intended to use the greatest\r\nnumber of days that are allotted to man. But at this day schooling and\r\nlearning mean, to obtain useful knowledge in the quickest way that a\r\nthoroughness can be obtained. If there is any method by which arithmetic\r\ncan be taught so as to master it in thirty days instead of thirty months\r\nlet us have it. We want knowledge, we are willing to pay for it, we want\r\nall we pay for, and we want our heads kept out of the sausage-mill of\r\ntime wasting.\r\n\r\nA great question now stands before us: What are the possibilities of\r\nmind to improve our methods of gaining knowledge, shorten time, and\r\ngetting greater and better results? I am free to say the question is too\r\nmomentous to form an answer, as each day brings a new wonder, to the man\r\nor woman who reasons on cause, and gives demonstrations by effects.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS LIFE?\r\n\r\nThe philosopher who first asked that question no one knows. But all\r\nintelligent persons are interested in the solution of this problem, at\r\nleast to know some tangible reason why it is called life; whether life\r\nis personal or so arranged that it might be called an individualized\r\nprinciple of nature.\r\n\r\nI wish to think for a time on this line, because we should make a wise\r\nhandling of the machinery of the body.\r\n\r\nIf life in man has been formed to suit the size and duties of the being;\r\nif life has a living and separate personage, then we should be governed\r\nby such reasons as would give it the greatest chance to go on with its\r\nlabors in the bodies of man and beast.\r\n\r\nWe know by experience that a spark of fire will start the principles of\r\npowder into motion, which, were it not stimulated by the positive\r\nprinciple of father nature, which finds this germ lying quietly in the\r\nwomb of space, would be silently inactive for all ages, without being\r\nable to move or help itself, save for the motor principle of life given\r\nby the father of all motion.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW IS ACTION PRODUCED.\r\n\r\nRight here we could and should ask the question: Is this action produced\r\nby electricity put in motion, or is it the active principle that comes\r\nas a spiritual man? If so, it is useless to try, or hope to know what\r\nlife is in its minutia. But we do know that life can only display its\r\nnatural forces by the visible action of the forms it produces.\r\n\r\nIf we inspect man as a machine, we find a complete building, a machine\r\nthat courts inspection and criticism. It demands a full exploration of\r\nall its parts with their uses. Then the mind is asked to see or find the\r\nconnection between the physical, and the spiritual. By nature you can\r\nreason on the roads that the powers of life are arranged to suit its\r\nsystem of motion.\r\n\r\nIf life is an individualized personage, as we might express that\r\nmysterious something, and it must have definite arrangements by which it\r\ncan be united and act with matter; then we are admonished to acquaint\r\nourselves with the arrangements of those natural connections, the one or\r\nmany, as they are connected to all parts of the completed being.\r\n\r\nAs motion is the first and only evidence of life, by this thought we are\r\nconducted to the machinery through which life works to accomplish these\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n\r\nACQUAINT YOURSELF WITH THE MACHINERY.\r\n\r\nIf the brain be that division in which force is generated or stored, you\r\nmust at all hazards acquaint yourself with that structure of this\r\nmachine; trace the connection from brain to heart, from heart to lungs,\r\nand other organs that can be acted upon by the brain, whose duty may be\r\nto construct the fleshy and bony parts of the body. Trace from the brain\r\nto the chemical laboratories, and note their action as they unite and\r\nprepare blood and other fluids, that are used in the economy of this\r\nvital, self-constructing and self-moving wonder, commonly known as man;\r\nwherein life and matter do unite, and express their friendly relation\r\none with the other; and while this relation exists we have the living\r\nman only, expressing and proving the relation that can exist between\r\nlife and matter, from the lowest living atom, to the greatest worlds.\r\nThey can only express form and action by this law. Harmony only dwells\r\nwhere obstructions do not exist.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTY OF THE OSTEOPATH.\r\n\r\nThe Osteopath finds here the field in which he can dwell forever. His\r\nduties as a philosopher admonish him, that life and matter can be\r\nunited, and that union cannot continue with any hindrance to the free\r\nand absolute motion. Therefore his duty is to keep away from the track\r\nall that will hinder the complete passage of the forces of the nervous\r\nsystem, that by that power the blood may be delivered and adjusted, to\r\nkeep the system in normal condition. Here is your duty; do it well, if\r\nyou wish to succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMATION OF SACRUM.\r\n\r\nWe believe only when we do not know. Belief and doubt are equal terms.\r\nIf we believe the sacrum is formed by a local system, then we can or\r\nwill have cause to believe that the rectum and colon appear after the\r\nouter skin is in process of forming. For want of the truths we are left\r\nin speculative doubt. I believe the lower bowels are formed by local\r\nmachinery that receives and appropriates to the purpose of construction\r\nof such parts or organs as nature designs to be used there. If we\r\ndissect a chicken as soon as hatched we will find the colon beginning at\r\nrectum and complete in form, but not connected to the small intestines.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PELVIS.\r\n\r\nTo get more directly at the point I want to make I will say I have some\r\nreasons to believe that the lower bowels are builded from rectum to the\r\nvermiform appendix, by acts of pelvis. It may be well to state that I\r\nhave seen formation of rectum and colon in the chicken, before the small\r\nintestines were visible at all. Then in same chicken I saw, liver, lung,\r\ncrop and gizzard, and only one artery in the region of the small\r\nintestines. From this I was led to believe that the pelvis did much of\r\nthe forming of the viscera. If so, then we could look for much relief\r\nthrough the system of the pelvis.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPEARANCE OF OEDEMA.\r\n\r\nOEdema is the one word that appears to be at the first showing of life\r\nand death in animal forms. Previous to death by general swelling of\r\nsystem, a watery swelling of fascia and lymphatics, even to those of\r\nnerve fibers. If a disease should destroy life by withholding all\r\nfluids, we can trace such cause in the beginning to a time when there\r\nwas watery swelling of the centers of nerves of nutrition, to such\r\namount as to cut off nerve supply until sensation ceased to renovate and\r\nkeep off accumulating fluids so long that fermentation did the work of\r\nheating till all fluids had dried up, and the channels of supply closed\r\nby adhesive inflammation, and death follows by the law of general\r\natrophy.\r\n\r\n\r\nDO ALL DISEASES HAVE BEGINNING IN OEDEMA?\r\n\r\nTo assert that all diseases have their beginning in oedema may be wide\r\nin range, but we often find one principle to rule over much territory.\r\n\"Instance:\" Mind is the supreme ruler of all beings, from the mites of\r\nlife to the monsters of the land and sea. Thus we see a ruling principle\r\nis without limit. The same of numbers. By heat all metals melt to\r\nfluidity; acids must have oxygen to begin as solvents in most metals. We\r\nonly speak imperfectly of some common laws to prepare the student to\r\nthink on the line of probabilities as I hold them out for consideration.\r\nSuppose we begin at the atoms of fluids such as enter to construct\r\nanimal or vegetable forms, and pen up till decomposition begins. By\r\nsuch delay does not nature call a halt and refuse to obey the laws of\r\nconstruction and let all other supplies pile up even to death? Is not\r\nall this the result of oedema? OEdema surely begins with the first\r\ntardy atom of matter.\r\n\r\nPneumonia begins by its oedematous accumulations of dead atoms, even\r\nto the death of the whole body, all having found a start in atoms only.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS FOR THE OSTEOPATH.\r\n\r\nWe will close this chapter by propounding a few questions which the\r\nOsteopath should keep in mind.\r\n\r\nAre the human and animal forms complete as working machines?\r\n\r\nHas nature furnished man with powers to make his bones; give them the\r\nneeded shapes of durable material, strong in kind?\r\n\r\nDoes a section in nature's law provide fastenings to hold these to one\r\nanother?\r\n\r\nThen another question arises: How will this body move, and where and how\r\nis the force applied?\r\n\r\nWhere and how is this force obtained?\r\n\r\nHow is it generated and supplied to these parts of motion?\r\n\r\nWhat makes these muscles, ligaments, nerves, veins, arteries?\r\n\r\nAre they self-forming, or has nature prepared machinery to make them?\r\n\r\nDoes animal life contain knowledge and force to construct all of the\r\nparts of man?\r\n\r\nCan it run the machine after it has finished it?\r\n\r\nBy what power does it move?\r\n\r\nIs there a blood vessel running to all parts of this body to supply all\r\nthese demands?\r\n\r\nIf it has a battery of force, where is it?\r\n\r\nWhat does it use for force?\r\n\r\nIs it electricity? If so how does it collect and use this substance?\r\n\r\nHow does it convey its powers to any or all places?\r\n\r\nHow does the man keep warm without fire?\r\n\r\nHow does he build and lose flesh all the time?\r\n\r\nWhere and how is the supply made and delivered to proper places?\r\n\r\nHow is it applied and what holds it to its place when adjusted?\r\n\r\nWhat makes it build the house of life?\r\n\r\nDo demand and supply govern the work? If not, what does?\r\n\r\nAre the laws of animal life sufficient to do all this work of building\r\nand repairing wastes and keep it in running condition?\r\n\r\nIf it does, what can man do or suggest to help it?\r\n\r\nIs this machine capable of being run fast or slow if need be?\r\n\r\nDoes man have in him some kind of chemical laboratory that can turn out\r\nsuch products as he needs to fill all his physical demands?\r\n\r\nIf by heat, exercise, or any other cause he gets warm, can that\r\nchemistry cool him to normal?\r\n\r\nIf too cold can it warm him? Can it adjust him to heat and cold?\r\n\r\nIf so, how is it done? Is the law of life and longevity fully vindicated\r\nin man's make up?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nHAS MAN DEGENERATED?\r\n\r\n     The Advent of Man--Care of the Stock Raiser--Mental Degeneration\r\n     Makes It Unpleasant for an Original Thinker--Original Thinkers of\r\n     the Ancients--Methods of Healing--Failure of Allopathy--Primitive\r\n     Man--Evidences of Prehistoric Man--Mental Dwarfage.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ADVENT OF MAN.\r\n\r\nThe exact time when man's foot appeared on the earth, no record shows. A\r\nknowledge of his advent might be profitable. The unwritten history of\r\nthe human races with the genius or lack of genius, might to us be an\r\nopen book of knowledge. As it is not supposable that the mind of man has\r\njust become observingly active in the last few centuries, absolute\r\nevidence of purer and deeper reason than we have been able to present,\r\nstand recorded on the faces of many valuable \"lost arts\" which we have\r\nnever been able to equal. Is it not very reasonable to suppose that the\r\npowers of mind have wonderfully degenerated from some cause?\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE OF THE STOCK RAISER.\r\n\r\nThe stock raiser carefully preserves the best and most healthy of the\r\nmales and females of his flocks and herds for breeding purposes, that\r\ntheir offspring might be healthy and well developed, for the purposes\r\nfor which he raises them. As a result he raises stock from the poultry\r\nhouse up, with marked improvement in form, strength and usefulness.\r\nShould he be foolish enough to kill off all the healthy and well\r\ndeveloped males as they appear in his herds of cattle and other stock,\r\nfor one or two centuries, would any one with average intelligence\r\nsuppose that the standard of animals would or could be kept up, by\r\nbreeding from the unfortunate stock, that had been pierced through the\r\nlungs while fighting with more powerful animals. If for breeding\r\npurposes he would save calves, colts, lambs, pigs, goats or any other\r\nyoung males to breed from, that had had a leg frozen off, one or both\r\neyes plucked out, necks and ears torn by panthers, what would you think\r\nof the man's sanity?\r\n\r\nOn this line we would ask what has been the procedure of all nations?\r\nHas it not been to select the strong and healthy males, drive them out\r\nto the field of battle, destroy a million or more of the strongest men,\r\nas our war of the sixties shows. Since that war closed the fathers of\r\nour children are mainly the crippled, worn out, and degenerated physical\r\nwrecks, with the assistance of the refused, who for lack of physical\r\nability were barred from entering the United States' service. Such\r\nphysical and mental wrecks are the fathers of the children born during\r\nthe last thirty years. Every healthy young lady who married and became a\r\nmother after the early sixties, had to select a husband from a war or\r\nhereditary wreck. From that degenerated stock of human beings our\r\nasylums are filled, and the beams of the gallows pulled down by the\r\nweight of the bodies of those mental dwarfs. Run this train of reason\r\nback for a few hundred or thousand of years,--this degenerating force,\r\nbearing upon the offspring, and is it a wonder that we have physical and\r\nmental wrecks all over the country?\r\n\r\n\r\nMENTAL DEGENERATION MAKES IT UNPLEASANT FOR THE ORIGINAL THINKER.\r\n\r\nNow if we have been mentally degenerating, killing our best men back for\r\na few thousand years time, and still have a few left who are fairly good\r\nreasoners, what was their mental powers then, compared with now? They\r\ncould think from native ability; we only through acquired ability by our\r\nmethods of education. Should an original thinker occasionally appear\r\nfrom the crippled and maimed, he will have much that is unpleasant to\r\ncontend with, unless he is generous enough to credit the cause to an\r\neffect produced by the lack of mental and physical forces in the sires\r\njust described. A man or woman who is able to reason, cannot afford to\r\nwear out his or her physical and mental forces by spending time in\r\ntiresome discussions with such blank masses, who are very fortunate to\r\nhave intelligence enough to make a living under the methods that require\r\nthe least mental action.\r\n\r\nIt would not be manly nor lady like to allow a feeling of combattiveness\r\nto arise and spend your forces on such persons. Pre-natal causes have\r\ndropped them where they are, and a philosopher knows he must submit to\r\nthe conditions, and he is sorrowful in place of vengeful and\r\nvindicative, and all that is left for him to do is to trim his lamps and\r\nlet the lights defend themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINAL THINKERS OF THE ANCIENTS.\r\n\r\nOn this line we have much to think of. Anciently they did think: Great\r\nminds existed then, as is evidenced by the architecture displayed in\r\nconstructing temples and pyramids. As in philosophy, chemistry, and\r\nmathematics, they stand to-day as living facts of their intelligence. In\r\nsome ways we are equal and even surpass the ancients. Before the\r\nestablishment of religious and political governments, national and\r\ntribal creeds, to sustain which the powerful minds and bodies of\r\nthousands and millions have been slain and their wise councils\r\nprohibited by death. Reason says under the circumstances we must kindly\r\nmake and do the best we can in our day and time. No doubt their religion\r\nwas better than ours, before they began to fight about their gods and\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF HEALING.\r\n\r\nSome evidence crops out now and then that their methods of healing were\r\nnatural and wisely applied, and crowned with good results. As far as\r\nhistory speaks of the ancient healing arts they were logical,\r\nphilosophical, good in results and harmless. It is true enough that we\r\nhave great systems of chemistry that are useful in the mechanical arts,\r\nbut very limited in their uses in the healing arts. In fact, a very\r\ngreat per cent of the gray-haired philosophers of all medical schools,\r\nunhesitatingly assert that the world would be better off without them.\r\nThese conclusions are sent forth by competent and honest investigators,\r\nwho have tested all known methods and medicines, and carefully observed\r\nthe results from a quarter to a half a century. Let us call it \"a\r\ntrade,\" as the use of drugs is not a science.\r\n\r\nThe author will now say, the health hunter in a majority of cases, when\r\nhe administers drugs, gives one dose for health and nine for the dollar.\r\n\r\nAs it becomes necessary to throw off oppressive governments, it becomes\r\njust as necessary to throw off other useless customs, without which no\r\nsubstitute has ever been received.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAILURE OF ALLOPATHY.\r\n\r\nAllopathy, a school of medicine known and fostered by all nations, drove\r\non with its exploring teams; gave up the search, went into camp and\r\nbuilded temples to the god who purged, puked, perspired, opiated, drank\r\nwhiskey and other stimulants; destroyed its thousands, ruined nations,\r\nestablished whiskey saloons, opium dens, insane asylums, naked mothers\r\nand hungry babies, and still cries aloud, and says: \"Come unto me and I\r\nwill give you rest. I have opium, morphine, and whiskey by the barrel. I\r\nam the god of all healing knowledge, and want to be so recognized by\r\npeople and statute. I do not wish to be annoyed by Eclecticism,\r\nHomoeopathy, Christian science, massage, Swedish movements, nor\r\nOsteopathy. I do not like Osteopathy any better than I do a tiger. It\r\nscratches me and tears away all my disciples. I cannot destroy it. It\r\nuses neither opium nor whiskey, and it is impossible to catch it asleep.\r\nIt scratches us, and has scratched our power out of four states during\r\nthe last twelve months, with no telling where it will scratch next time.\r\nWe must prepare for more war, I have heard from my scouts that on its\r\nflag the inscription reads thus: 'No quarters for allopathy in\r\nparticular and none at all for any schools of medicine farther than\r\nsurgery, and war to the hilt on three-fourths of that as practiced in\r\nthe present day. The use of the knife in everything and for everything\r\nmust be stopped; not by statute law, but through a higher education of\r\nthe masses, which will give them more confidence in nature's ability to\r\nheal.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIMITIVE MAN.\r\n\r\nIt is reasonable to suppose that the mind that constructed man was fully\r\ncompetent to undertake and complete the being to suit the purpose for\r\nwhich he was designed. After giving him physical perfection in every\r\nlimb, organ, or part of his body, it is reasonable to suppose, that at\r\nthat time, he gave him all the mental powers needed for all purposes\r\nduring the life of his race, and with that perfection in the physical,\r\nit is supposable he approached very nearly to intellectual perfection.\r\nHe was a mathematician, not by collegiate process, but by native\r\nability. He did not have to take a course in a university to study\r\nchemistry, because of the fact that he was a chemist when he was born.\r\nPossibly he could speak or understand all languages spoken by the human\r\ntongue, from the powers of his mind, which occupied a pure and healthy\r\nphysique. In a word he was well made and fully endowed with all the\r\nphysical and mental forces necessary to the whole journey of his life.\r\nNow a question arises: \"When did he begin to degenerate physically and\r\nmentally?\" Let us reason some on this line, which seems to be a rather\r\nsolid foundation, and as history is young itself, and has imperfectly\r\nrecorded only such events as have transpired during a few centuries,\r\nwith records imperfectly preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVIDENCES OF PREHISTORIC MAN.\r\n\r\nWe see evidences all along the journey of prehistoric man's life, though\r\nthe being and his bones have been mostly obliterated; we see close to\r\nhis bony remains the stone axe, the flint-dart. We find acres of ground\r\nin many places close to mounds and caves, with countless millions of\r\nslivers that have been scaled from flints and formed to suit war\r\npurposes; while the many bones that are found in caves, heaps and piles,\r\nindicate that many thousands fell in mortal combat then and there.\r\nPossibly they were old in the skilled arts of war at that day. Their\r\ngreat and powerful men, who should have been parents of the coming\r\ngenerations, were slain and destroyed and the conquered became the\r\ncaptives and slaves of the more powerful, with all opportunities for\r\nmental development suppressed. Other nations and tribes willingly\r\nentered the bloody fields of battle, with nothing to report but the\r\ndeath of the best physically formed men, and leaving the propagation of\r\nthe race or races to be kept up by those who were left behind as\r\nunqualified to go into battle, for lack of strength of either body or\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nThis process of destroying the mentally and physically great has been\r\nkept up to the limits of our history's record. We have to go to schools\r\nabout one-half of our time in order to cultivate and stimulate our\r\nmental energies sufficiently well, that we may follow the ordinary\r\nbusiness pursuits of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nMENTAL DWARFAGE.\r\n\r\nWithout worrying the patience of the reader any further, we will ask him\r\nif it is not reasonable that during all the past thousands of years,\r\nthat men have fought over their gods and governments, has it not\r\nproduced the mental dwarfage from the causes he has had to face? Our\r\nprofessional men are only imitators of one another. They must spend\r\nyears in school because of a lack of native ability. This is our\r\ncondition, and we must make the best we can of it. Most of our learned\r\nmen, so-called, at the present day, stand upon heaps of mental rubbish.\r\nYou seldom see in an editor's columns any evidence of mental greatness.\r\nHe clips, quotes and sells his wisdom. He takes up some hobby,\r\nreligious or scientific. He lauds his own religious views; his\r\nscientific ideas he wishes embalmed for the use of future generations.\r\nHis law is _the_ law. His medicine is God's pills, notwithstanding he is\r\nthe laughing stock of all who know him. I want to be good to them. I\r\nexpect to be good to them, as they are suffering from the effects of\r\npre-natal causes, thrown upon them by their ancestors for thousands of\r\nyears. By those causes they have been possibly wounded worse than I\r\nhave, and I do not expect to spend any time in combats with mental\r\ndwarfs; political, religious, or scientific bigots. If I can\r\nsuccessfully run my boat over the riffles of time, I shall credit it to\r\ngood luck, not native ability, for I, too, feel what they should,--the\r\ndeep plowings of mental dwarfage, that is the result of killing all the\r\ngreat and good men for ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nOSTEOPATHIC TREATMENT.\r\n\r\n     Five Points--Visceral List--Care in Treating the Spinal\r\n     Column--Most Important Chapter--Perfect Drainage--A Natural Cure.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE POINTS.\r\n\r\nThe five points of observation will cover easily the whole body, and we\r\ncannot omit any one of them, and successfully examine any disease of the\r\nsystem. Local injuries are, however, an exception to this rule, and even\r\na local hurt often causes general effect. Suppose a fall should jar the\r\nlumbar vertebra, and push it at some articulation, front, back, or\r\nlaterally; say the lumbar, with one or two short ribs turned down\r\nagainst the lumbar nerves with a prolapsed and loosened diaphragm,\r\npressing heavily on the abdominal aorta, vena cava, and thoracic duct;\r\nhave you not found cause to stop or derange the circulation of blood in\r\narteries, veins, lymphatics and all other organs below diaphragm? Then\r\nheart trouble would be the natural result. Fibroid tumors, painful\r\nmonthlies, constipation, diabetis, dyspepsia or any trouble of the\r\nsystem that could come from bad blood would be natural results, because\r\nlymph is too old to be pure when it enters the lungs for purifying. If\r\nblood or chyle is kept too long below the diaphragm, it becomes diseased\r\nbefore it reaches the lungs, and after renovation, but little good blood\r\nis left. Then the dead matter is separated from blood and blown out at\r\nthe lungs while in vapor. Thus nutriment is not great enough to keep up\r\nnormal supply. In this stage the patient is low in flesh and feeble\r\ngenerally, because of trouble with blood and chyle to pass normally\r\nthrough the diaphragm.\r\n\r\n\r\nVISCERAL LIST.\r\n\r\nThe failure of free action of blood produces general debility,\r\ncongestion, low types of fever, dropsy, constipation, tumefaction and on\r\nto the whole list of visceral of diseases.\r\n\r\nFrom this we are called to the pelvis. If the innominate bones are\r\ntwisted on sacrum or are driven too high or too low, an injury to the\r\nsacral system of blood and nerves would be cause equal to congestion,\r\ninflammation of womb or bladder-diseases, with a crippled condition of\r\nall the spinal nerves. This would be cause enough to produce hysteria,\r\nand on to the whole list of diseases to spinal injuries. The Osteopath\r\nhas great demands for his powers of reason when he considers the\r\nrelation of diseases generally to the pelvis; and this knowledge he\r\nmust have before his work can be attended with success.\r\n\r\nAs I said, five points comprise the fields in which the Osteopath must\r\nsearch. I have given you quite pointedly and at length, hints on spine\r\nand sacrum which cover the territory below the diaphragm. In conclusion\r\nI will simply refer you to the chest, neck and brain, and say, \"let your\r\nsearch light ever shine bright on the brain.\" On it we must depend for\r\npower. About all nerves do run through the neck and branch off to supply\r\nboth above and below, to do their parts in animal life, to the heart,\r\nbrain and sum total of man and beast. Search faithfully for cause of\r\ndiseases in head, neck, chest, spine and pelvis; for all organs, limbs\r\nand parts are directly related to and depend on these five localities to\r\nwhich I have just called your attention.\r\n\r\nWith your knowledge of anatomy, I am sure you can practice and be\r\nsuccessful, and should be in all cases over which Osteopathy is supposed\r\nto preside.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE IN TREATING THE SPINAL CORD.\r\n\r\nI want to offer you the facts, not advice, but pure and well sustained\r\nfacts, the only witnesses that ever enter the courts of truth. A spinal\r\ncord is a fact; you see it--thus a fact. That which you can see, feel,\r\nhear, smell or taste is a fact, and the knowledge of the ability of any\r\none fact to accomplish any one thing, how it accomplishes it and for\r\nwhat purpose, is a truth sought for in philosophy. The spinal cord is\r\nthe present fact for consideration. You see it, you feel it, thus you\r\nhave two facts with which you can start to obtain a knowledge of the use\r\nof this spinal cord. In it you have one common straight cylinder which\r\nis filled with an unknown substance, and by an unknown power wisely\r\ndirected. It is wisely formed, located, and protected. It throws off\r\nbranches which are wisely located. They have bundles, many and few; they\r\nare connected to their support, which is the brain, by a continuous cord\r\nin length and form to suit. After it has concluded throwing off branches\r\nat local places for special purposes, then like a flashlight, it throws\r\noff a bundle of branches called horse-tail plexus, _caudae equinae_,\r\nwhich simply signifies the many branches that convey fluids and\r\ninfluences to the extremities, to execute the vital work for which they\r\nare formed and located. While the laws of life and their procedure to\r\nexecute and accomplish the work designed by nature for them to do, is\r\nmysterious and to the finite mind incomprehensible, you can only see\r\nwhat they do or perform, after the work is done and ready for your\r\ninspection.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO TREAT THE SPINAL COLUMN.\r\n\r\nNow as we are dealing with the omnipresent nerve principle of animal\r\nlife, I will tell you this one serious truth, and support it by the fact\r\nof observation. To treat the spine, and thereby irritate the spinal cord\r\noftener than once or twice a week will cause the vital assimilation to\r\nbe perverted, and become the death-producing excretor, by producing the\r\nabortion of the living molecules of life, before fully matured, while in\r\nthe cellular system, which lies immediately under the lymphatics.\r\n\r\nYour patients will linger long from the change of the nutrient ducts to\r\nthrow off their dead matter into the excretories, which death was caused\r\nby the undue, or too many treatments of the spinal cord. If you will\r\nallow yourself to think for a moment, or think at all of the spinal cord\r\nbeing irritated, and what effect it will have on the uterus you will\r\nrealize that I have told you a truth, and produced an array of facts to\r\nstand by that truth. Many of your patients are well six months before\r\nthey are discharged. They are kept on hands because they are weak, and\r\nthey are weak, because you keep them so from irritating the spinal cord.\r\nThrow off your goggles and receive the rays of the sunlight which\r\nforever stand in the bosom of reason.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOST IMPORTANT CHAPTER OF ALL.\r\n\r\nThis is the most important chapter of this book, because at this point\r\nthe engine of life is turned over to you as an engineer and by you it is\r\nexpected to be wisely conducted on its journey.\r\n\r\nYour responsibility here is doubled. Your first position is that of a\r\nmaster mechanic, who is capable of drawing plans and writing minutely a\r\nspecification whereby the engineer may know what a well constructed\r\nmachine is in every particular. He knows the parts and relations of both\r\nas constructor and operator, and you are supposed to be the foreman in\r\nthe shop of repairs. The living person is the engine, nature the\r\nengineer, and you the master mechanic.\r\n\r\nThis being your position it is expected that you will carefully inspect\r\nall parts of the engines run into your repair shop, note all variations\r\nfrom the truly normal, and adjust from those variations as nearly as\r\npossible to the conditions of the true specimen that stands in the shop.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERFECT DRAINAGE.\r\n\r\nAt this point it will be proper to suppose a case by way of\r\nillustration. Suppose by some accident the bones of the neck should be\r\nthrown at variance from the normal to a bend or twist. We may then\r\nexpect inharmony in the circulation of the blood to the head and face\r\nwith all the organs and glands above the neck. We will find imperfect\r\nsupply of blood and other fluids to the head. We may expect swelling of\r\nhead and face with local or general misery. Thus you have a cause for\r\nheadache, dizziness, blindness, enlarged tonsils, sore tongue, loss of\r\nsight, hearing, memory, and on through the list of head diseases, all\r\nbecause of perverted circulation of the fluids of the brain proper of\r\nany local division. It is important to have perfect drainage, for\r\nwithout it, the good results from a treatment cannot be expected to\r\nfollow your efforts to relieve diseases above the neck.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT TREATING MEANS.\r\n\r\nHere I want to emphasize that the word treat has but one meaning, that\r\nis to know you are right, and do your work accordingly. I will only\r\nhint, and would feel embarrassed to go any farther than to hint to you,\r\nthe importance of an undisturbed condition of the five known kinds of\r\nnerves, namely: sensation, motion, nutrition, voluntary and involuntary,\r\nall of which you must labor to keep in perpetual harmony while treating\r\nany disease of the head, neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, spine and limbs.\r\n\r\nIf you would allow yourself to reason at all, you must know that\r\nsensation must be normal and always on guard to give notice by local or\r\ngeneral misery, of unnatural accumulation of the circulating fluids.\r\nEach set of nerves must be free to act and do their part. Your duty as a\r\nmaster mechanic is to know that the engine kept is in so perfect a\r\ncondition that there will be no functional disturbance to any nerve,\r\nvein, or artery that supplies and governs the skin, the fascia, the\r\nmuscle, the blood or any fluid that should freely circulate to sustain\r\nlife and renovate the system from deposits that would cause what we call\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n\r\nA NATURAL CURE.\r\n\r\nYour Osteopathic knowledge has surely taught you, that with an intimate\r\nacquaintance with the nerve and blood supply, you can arrive at a\r\nknowledge of the hidden cause of disease, and conduct your treatment to\r\na successful termination. This is not by your knowledge of chemistry,\r\nbut by the absolute knowledge of what is in man. What is normal, and\r\nwhat abnormal, what is effect and how to find the cause. Do you ever\r\nsuspect renal or bladder trouble without first receiving knowledge from\r\nyour patient, that there is soreness and tenderness in the region of the\r\nkidneys at some point along the spine. By this knowledge you are invited\r\nto explore the spine for the purpose of ascertaining whether it is\r\nnormal or not. If by your intimate acquaintance and observance of a\r\nnormal spine you should detect an abnormal form although it be small,\r\nyou are then admonished to look out for disease of kidneys, bladder or\r\nboth, from the discovered cause for disturbance of the renal nerves by\r\nsuch displacement, or some slight variation from the normal in the\r\narticulation of the spine. If this is not worthy of your attention, your\r\nmind is surely too crude to observe those fine beginnings that lead to\r\ndeath. Your skill would be of little use in incipient cases of Bright's\r\ndisease of the kidneys. Has not your acquaintance with the human body\r\nopened your mind's eye to observe that in the laboratory of the human\r\nbody, the most wonderful chemical results are being accomplished every\r\nday, minute and hour of your life? Can that laboratory be running in\r\ngood order and tolerate the forming of a gall or bladder stone? Does not\r\nthe body generate acids, alkalies, substances and fluids necessary to\r\nwash out all impurities? If you think an unerring God has made all those\r\nnecessary preparations, why not so assert, and stand upon that stone?\r\n\r\nYou cannot do otherwise, and not betray your ignorance to the thinking\r\nworld. If in the human body you can find the most wonderful chemical\r\nlaboratory mind can conceive of, why not give more of your time to that\r\nsubject, that you may obtain a better understanding of its workings?\r\nCan you afford to treat your patients without such qualification? Is it\r\nnot ignorance of the workings of this Divine law that has given birth to\r\nthe foundationless nightmare that now prevails to such an alarming\r\nextent all over civilization, that a deadly drug will prove its efficacy\r\nin warding off disease in a better way than has been prescribed by the\r\nintelligent God, who has formulated and combined life, mind and matter\r\nin such a manner that it becomes the connecting link between a world of\r\nmind, and that element known as matter? Can a deep philosopher do\r\notherwise than conclude that nature has placed in man all the qualities\r\nfor his comfort and longevity? Or will he drink that which is deadly,\r\nand cast his vote for the crucifixion of knowledge?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nREASONING TESTS.\r\n\r\n     The Vermiform Appendix--Operating for Appendicitis--Expelling Power\r\n     of the Vermiform Appendix--Care Exercised in Making\r\n     Assertions--Reasoning Tests--A List of Unexplained\r\n     Diseases--Concluding Remarks.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VERMIFORM APPENDIX.\r\n\r\nAt the present time more than at any other period since the birth of\r\nChrist, the medical and surgical world have centralized their minds for\r\nthe purpose of relieving locally inside, below the kidney of the male or\r\nfemale, excruciating pain, which appears in both sexes in the region\r\nabove described.\r\n\r\nFrom some cause, possibly justifiable, it has been decided to open the\r\nhuman body and explore the region just below the right kidney in search\r\nof the cause of this trouble. Such explorations have been made upon the\r\ndead first. Small seeds and other substances have been found in the\r\nvermiform appendix, which is a hollow tube over an inch in length. These\r\ndiscoveries, as found in the dead subject, have led to explorations in\r\nthe same location in the living. In some of the cases, though very few,\r\nseeds and other substances have been found in the vermiform appendix,\r\nsupposed to be the cause of local or general inflammation of the\r\nappendix. Some have been successfully removed, and permanent relief\r\nfollowed the operation. These explorations and successes in finding\r\nsubstances in the vermiform appendix, their removal, and successful\r\nrecovery in some cases, have led to what may properly be termed a hasty\r\nsystem of diagnosis, and it has become very prevalent, and resorted to\r\nby the physicians of many schools, under the impression that the\r\nvermiform appendix is of no known use, and that the human being is just\r\nas well off without it.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPERATING FOR APPENDICITIS.\r\n\r\nTherefore it is resolved, that as nothing positive is known of the\r\ntrouble in the location above described, it is guessed that it is a\r\ndisease of the vermiform appendix. Therefore they etherize and dissect\r\ndown for the purpose of exploring, to ascertain if the guess is right or\r\nwrong. In the diagnosis this is a well-defined case of appendicitis; the\r\nsurgeon's knife is driven through the quivering flesh in great eagerness\r\nin search of the vermiform appendix. The bowels are rolled over and\r\naround in search of the appendix. Sometimes some substances are found in\r\nit; but often to the chargrin of the exploring physician, it is found to\r\nbe in a perfectly healthy and natural condition, and so seldom is it\r\nfound impact with seeds or any substance whatever, that as a general\r\nrule it is a useless and dangerous experiment. The per cent of deaths\r\ncaused by the knife and ether, and the permanently crippled, will\r\njustify the assertion that it would be far better for the human race if\r\nthey lived and died in ignorance of appendicitis. A few genuine cases\r\nmight die from that cause; but if the knife were the only known remedy,\r\nit were better that one should occasionally die than to continue this\r\nsystem, at least until the world recognizes a relief which is absolutely\r\nsafe, without the loss of a drop of blood, that has for its foundation\r\nand philosophy a fact based upon the longitudinal contractile ability of\r\nthe appendix itself, which is able to eject by its natural forces any\r\nsubstances that may by an unnatural move be forced into the appendix.[8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: My first Osteopathic treatment for appendicitis was in\r\n1877, at which time I operated on a Mr. Surratt and gave permanent\r\nrelief. During the early eighties I treated and permanently cured Mrs\r\nEmily Pickler of Kirksville, mother of our representative, S. M.\r\nPickler, and mother of ex-congressman John A. Pickler of South Dakota.\r\nThe infirmary has had bad cases of appendicitis probably running up into\r\nhundreds without failing to relieve and cure a single case. The ability\r\nof the appendix to receive and discharge foreign substances is taught in\r\nthe American School of Osteopathy and is successfully practiced by its\r\ndiplomates. In the case of Mr. Surratt I found lateral twist of lumbar\r\nbones; I adjusted spine, lifted bowels, and he got well. When I was\r\ncalled to Mrs. Pickler she had been put on light diet, by the surgeon,\r\npreparatory to the knife. She soon recovered under my treatment without\r\nany surgical operation and is alive and well to this date.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPELLING POWER OF THE VERMIFORM APPENDIX.\r\n\r\nTo a philosopher such questions as this must arise: Has the appendix at\r\nits entrance a sphincter muscle similar in action to that of the rectum\r\nand oesophagus? Has it the power to contract and dilate?--contract and\r\nshorten in its length and eject all substances when the nerves are in a\r\nnormal condition? And where is the nerve that failed to execute the\r\nexpulsion of any substance that may enter the cavity of the appendix?\r\nHas God been so forgetful as to leave the appendix in such condition as\r\nto receive foreign bodies without preparing it by contraction or\r\notherwise to throw out such substances? If He has He surely forgot part\r\nof His work. So reason has concluded for me, and on that line I have\r\nproceeded to operate for twenty-five years without pain or misery to the\r\npatient, and given permanent relief in all cases that have come to me.\r\nWith the former diagnosis of doctors and surgeons that appendicitis was\r\nthe malady, and the choice of relief was the knife or death, or possibly\r\nboth, many such cases have come for Osteopathic treatment, and\r\nexamination has revealed that in every case there has been previous\r\ninjury to some set of spinal nerves, caused by jars, strains or falls.\r\nEvery case of appendicitis, gall or renal stones can be traced to some\r\nsuch cause. These principles I have proclaimed and thought for\r\ntwenty-five years.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE EXERCISED IN MAKING ASSERTIONS.\r\n\r\nWe should use much caution in our assertions that nature had made its\r\nwork so complete in animal forms and furnished them with such wisely\r\nprepared principles that they could produce and administer remedies to\r\nsuit, and not leave the body to find them. Should we so conclude and\r\nfind by experiment that man is so arranged, and wisely furnished by\r\ndeity as to ferret out disease, purify and keep the temple of life in\r\nease and health; we must use great care when we assert such is not\r\nundeniably true up to the present. The opposite opinion has had full\r\nsway for twenty centuries at least, and man has by habit, long usage,\r\nand ignorance so adjusted his mind to submit to customs of the great\r\npast that should he try, without previous training, to reason and bring\r\nhis mind to such altitude of thought of the greatness and wisdom of the\r\ninfinite, he might become insane or fall back in a stupor, and exist\r\nonly as a living mental blank in the great ocean of life, where beings\r\ndwell without minds to govern their actions. It would be a great\r\ncalamity to have all the untrained minds shocked so seriously as to\r\ncause them to lose the mite of reason they now have, and be sent back\r\nonce more to dwell in Darwin's protoplasm. I tell you there is danger,\r\nand we must be careful and show the people small stars, and but one at a\r\ntime, till they can begin to reason and realize that God has done all\r\nthat the wisest can attribute to Him.\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONING TESTS.\r\n\r\nThere is but one method of reasoning. That method is by the laws\r\ngoverning the subject to be reasoned upon.\r\n\r\nReasoning is the action of the mind while hunting for truths.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ABDOMEN.\r\n\r\nAs we are about to camp close to the abdomen for a season of\r\nexplorations and a more reasonable knowledge of its organs and their\r\nfunctions, we will search its geography first, and find its location on\r\nthe body or globe of life. We find a boundary line established by the\r\ngeneral surveyor, about the middle of the body, called the diaphragm.\r\nThis line has a very strong wall or striated muscle that can and does\r\ndilate and contract to suit for breathing, and quantities of food that\r\nmay be stored for a time in stomach and bowels for use. The abdomen is\r\nmuch longer than wide. In short, it is a house or shop builded for\r\nmanufacturing purposes. In it we find the machinery that produces rough\r\nblood or chyle, and sends it to heart and lungs to be finished to\r\nperfect living blood, to supply and sustain all the organs of this\r\ndivision. This diaphragm or wall has several openings through which\r\nblood and nutriment pass to and from abdomen to heart, lungs and brain.\r\nI want to draw your special attention to the fact that this diaphragm\r\nmust be truly normal. It must be anchored and held in its true position\r\nwithout any variation, and in order that you shall fully understand what\r\nI mean, I will ask you to go with me mentally to all the ribs, beginning\r\nwith the sternum, see attachments, follow across with a downward course\r\nto the attachments of this great muscular septum to the lower lumbar\r\nregion, where the right crus receives a branch or strong muscle from the\r\nleft side, and the left crus receives a muscle from the right which\r\nbecomes one common muscle known as the left crus, the same of the right\r\ncrus receiving a muscle or tendon from the left, which you will easily\r\ncomprehend from examining descriptive cuts in Gray, Morris, Gerrish, or\r\nany well illustrated work of anatomy. You see at once a chance for\r\nconstriction of the aorta by the muscles under which it passes, causing\r\nwithout doubt much of the disease known as palpitation of the heart,\r\nwhich is only a bouncing back of the blood that has been stopped at the\r\ncrura. Farther away from the spine near the center of the diaphragm we\r\nfind the return opening through this wall, provided to accommodate the\r\nvena cava. To the left a few inches below the vena cava we find another\r\nopening provided for the oesophagus and its nerves; like the aorta, it\r\nhas two muscles of the diaphragm crossing directly between oesophagus\r\nand the aorta, in such shape as to be able to produce powerful\r\nprohibitory constriction to normal swallowing.\r\n\r\n\r\nA LIST OF UNEXPLAINED DISEASES.\r\n\r\nAt this point I will draw your attention to what I consider is the cause\r\nof a whole list of hitherto unexplained diseases, which I think are only\r\neffects, caused by the blood and other fluids being prohibited from\r\ndoing normal service by constrictions at the various openings of the\r\ndiaphragm. Thus prohibition of free action of the thoracic duct would\r\nproduce congestion of receptaculum chyli, because of not being able to\r\ndischarge its contents as fast as received. Is it not reasonable to\r\nsuppose a ligation of the thoracic duct at the diaphragm would retain\r\nthis chyle until it would be diseased by age and fermentation, and be\r\nthrown off into the substances of other organs of the abdomen and set up\r\nnew growths, such as enlargement of the uterus, ovaries, kidneys, liver,\r\nspleen, pancreas, omentum, lymphatics, cellular membranes, and all that\r\nis known as flesh and blood below the diaphragm? Have you not reason to\r\nexplore and demand a deeper and more thorough anatomical knowledge of\r\nthe diaphragm and its power to produce disease while in an abnormal\r\ncondition, which can be caused by irritations, wounds or hurts, from the\r\nbase of the brain to the coccyx? Remember this is an anatomical and\r\nphilosophical question that will demand your attention to the mechanical\r\nformation, physiological action and the unobstructed privileges of\r\nfluids when prepared in the laboratory of nature, to be sent at once to\r\ntheir ordained destination, before such substances are diseased or dead\r\nwith age. You must remember that you have been well drilled, or talked\r\nout of patience in the room of symptomatology and all you have learned\r\nis, something ails the kidneys, and are told their contents when\r\nanalyzed are not normally pure urine. In urinalisis you are told \"here\r\nis sugar,\" \"here is fat,\" \"here is iron,\" \"here is pus,\" \"here is\r\nalbumen,\" and this is diabetis, this is Bright's disease, but no\r\nsuggestion is handed to the student's mind to make him know that these\r\nnumerous variations from normal urine are simply effects, and the\r\ndiaphragm has caused all the trouble, by first being irritated from\r\nhurts, by ribs falling, spinal strains, wounds and on from the coccyx to\r\nthe base of the brain. Symptomatology is very wide and wise in putting\r\nthis and that together and giving it names, but fails to give the cause\r\nof all these abdominal lesions. Never for once has it said or intimated\r\nthat the diaphragm is prolapsed by misplaced ribs to which it is\r\nattached, or that it is diseased by hurts of spine and nerves above its\r\nown location. Allow yourself to think of the universality of the\r\ndistribution of the superior cervical ganglion and other nerves which\r\nare of such great importance that I will by permission insert in the\r\nlast chapter of this book a description of that great system of the\r\nsympathetic nerves by Dr. Wm. Smith, whose superior knowledge of anatomy\r\nmakes him eminently qualified to describe the location and uses of this\r\ngreat sympathetic system of the nerves of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUDING REMARKS.\r\n\r\nAs you read his able essay remember there are four other sets of nerves\r\nequal to, and just as important in their divisions of life, which are\r\nthe motor, nutrient, voluntary and involuntary. All of which you as an\r\nengineer must know, and by proper adjustment of the body give them\r\nunlimited power to perform their separate and united parts in sustaining\r\nlife and health. Now as I have tried to place into your hands a compass,\r\nflag and chain that will lead you from effect to cause of disease in\r\nany part or organ of the whole abdomen I hope that many mysteries which\r\nhave hung over your mental horizon will pass away, and give you abiding\r\ntruths, placed upon the everlasting rock of cause and effect. You have\r\nas little use for old symptomatology as an Irishman has for a cork when\r\nthe bottle is empty. Osteopathy is knowledge, or it is nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nOBSTETRICS.\r\n\r\n     Overloading--Similarity of Stomach and Womb--Births--Preparation\r\n     for Delivery--Caution--Lasceration Need Not Occur--Care of\r\n     Cord--Severing Cord--Putting on Belly Band--Delivery of\r\n     Afterbirth--Preparing for Mother's Comfort--Post-Delivery\r\n     Hemorrhage--Treatment for--Food for Mother--Treatment for Sore\r\n     Breast.\r\n\r\n\r\nOVERLOADING.\r\n\r\nWhen in the course of human events and actions of life, a woman\r\ndisregards the laws of nature to such an extent as to overload the\r\nstomach beyond its powers and limits; or another way to present the\r\nthought, we will say, if you fill the stomach so full as to occupy all\r\nspace, or so much of the space as to cripple the laws of digestion and\r\nretain the food, the decomposition sets up an irritation of the nerves\r\nof mucous membrane to such a degree as to cause sickness and vomiting,\r\nor any other method of disgorging the stomach, which is the natural\r\nprocess to unload an overloaded vessel. When the nerves cannot take up\r\nnutrition, they will then take up destruction and other elements which\r\nare detrimental to the process of nutrition, and there is no other\r\nprocess for relief but to unload. The loading that has been deposited\r\nin the stomach was for the purpose of sustaining a being. The stomach\r\nitself is a sack. When filled to its greatest capacity, it irritates all\r\nthe surroundings, and in return they irritate the stomach. Thus it\r\nunloads naturally for relief. Now we wish to treat of another vessel\r\nsimilar in size, similar in all its actions, which receives nourishment\r\nfor a being, which nourishment is contained in the blood, and conveyed\r\nfrom the channels commonly known as uterine arteries. To all intents and\r\npurposes this nourishment is taken there to sustain animal life, after\r\nhaving constructed the machinery then it appropriates the blood to the\r\ngrowth and existence of a human being. One is the womb, the other the\r\nstomach. The placenta in the womb is provided with all the machinery\r\nnecessary to the preparation of blood, such as is used for all purposes\r\nin forming and developing a child. Which is the stomach? Which is the\r\nwomb? and what is the difference? Both receive and distribute\r\nnourishment to sustain animal life. Both get sick, both vomit when\r\nirritated and discharge their loading by the natural law of \"throw up\"\r\nand \"throw down.\" Now note the difference and govern yourselves\r\naccordingly. One is mid-wifery, or treatment of the lower stomach during\r\ngestation and delivery. The other is the upper stomach that takes\r\ncoarser material and refines the unrefined substances, keeps the outer\r\nman in form and being; the other contains the inner man or child, and by\r\nthe law of ejection, when it becomes an irritant, it is thrown out by\r\nthe nerves that govern the muscles of ejection.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRTHS.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate: I will say, just as long as digestion and assimilation\r\nkeep in harmony and the mother generates good blood in abundance, the\r\nchild grows, and by nature the womb is willing to let the work of\r\nbuilding the body of the child go on indefinitely; but nature has placed\r\nall the functions of animal life under laws that are absolute and must\r\nbe obeyed. We by reason are asked to note the similarity of the stomach\r\nand the womb, as both receive and pass nutriment to a body for\r\nassimilation and growth. When a stomach gets overloaded, sickness\r\nbegins, as digestion and assimilation has stopped, then the decaying\r\nmatter is taken up by the terminal nerves, and conveyed to the solar\r\nplexus, and causes the nerves of ejection, to throw the dying matter out\r\nof the stomach which is above. Try your reason and see the stomach below\r\nsicken and unload its burden. Is this sickness natural and wisely\r\ncaused? If this is not the philosophy of mid-wifery what is? As soon as\r\na being takes possession of its room, the commissary of supplies begins\r\nto furnish rations for that being, who has to build for itself a\r\ndwelling place. The house must be built strictly to the letter of the\r\nspecifiction. Much bone and flesh must be put into the house of life,\r\nand some of all elements known to the chemist, must be used and wisely\r\nblended to give strength; also all material to be used in the house must\r\nbe exact in form and given strength equal to all forces, that may be\r\nnecessary to execute the hard and continued labors of the machinery that\r\nmay be used in all transactions and motions of mind and body. Now we\r\nmust go to the manufacturing chief, and have him through the\r\nquartermaster deliver and keep a full supply of all kinds of material\r\nfor the work, and when the engine is done, put it on an inclined plane\r\nand cut the stay-chains and let it run out of the shop. Be careful and\r\nnot let the engine deface nor tear the door as it comes out. A question\r\nis asked: On what road does the quarter-master send the supplies? As\r\nthere is but one system over which an engine can bring supplies, we will\r\ncall that road the uterine system of arteries. The mechanic reports that\r\nhe will open the door of this great shop of manufacturing, and let it\r\nroll out the engine by the power and methods prepared to run out\r\nfinished work. First you see a door open because the lock is taken off\r\nby a key that opens all mysteries; and the great ropes that have been\r\nfar inferior to the force of resistance, that has held the door shut,\r\nare all sufficient in power. By getting sick, muscles become convulsed\r\nto rigidity of great strength with force enough to push the new engine\r\nof life out into open space easily, by nature's team that never fails to\r\nobey orders to deliver all goods intrusted to its care.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATION FOR DELIVERY.\r\n\r\nA student of mid-wifery can only learn a few general principles, before\r\nhe gets into the field of experience. Actual contact with labor teaches\r\nhim that much that he has read and had told to him by professors of\r\nmid-wifery in the lectures, is of but little use to him at the bedside.\r\nWhat he needs to know is, what he will have to do after he gets there.\r\nHe must know the form and size of the bones of a woman, how large a hole\r\nthe three bones of the pelvis make, for the reason that the child's head\r\nwill soon come through that hole. He must know a normal head cannot come\r\nthrough a pelvis that has been crushed in so much as to bring the pubis\r\nwithin one and one-half to two and one-half inches of the sacrum. He\r\nmust examine and know, and do this soon after he is called, for the\r\nreason, that he will have to use instruments in such deformities, and\r\nmay wish the counsel of an older and more experienced doctor. And this\r\nprecaution will give him time to be ready for any emergency.\r\n\r\nBut more than ninety per cent of all cases are of a very simple nature.\r\nThe mother is warned by pains in back and womb, coming and repeating at\r\nintervals of one-half hour to less time. When by the finger the doctor\r\ncan tell the mouth of the womb has opened to the size of a quarter or\r\nhalf dollar, he then may know that labor will soon start in good\r\nearnest, and at this time it is well to call for a twine, cut two\r\nstrings about a foot long, to tie around the navel cord.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUTION.\r\n\r\nThe first duty of the obstetrician is to carefully examine the bones of\r\nthe pelvis and spine of the mother, to ascertain if they are normal in\r\nshape and position. If there is any doubt about the spine and pelvis\r\nbeing in good condition for the passage of the head, through the bones,\r\nand you find pelvic deformity enough to prohibit the passage of the\r\nhead, notify the parties of the danger in the case at once, and that you\r\ndo not wish to take the responsibility alone, as it may require\r\ninstruments to deliver the child, as there is danger of death to the\r\nchild and mother also, but less danger to the mother than to the child.\r\nNow you have done that which is a safeguard against all trouble\r\nfollowing criminal ignorance.\r\n\r\nI will give you a condensed rule of procedure in all normal cases of\r\nobstetrics. With index finger, examine os uteri; if closed and only\r\nbackache, have patient turn on right side, and press hand on abdomen\r\nabove pelvis, and gently press or lift belly up just enough to allow\r\nblood to pass down and up pelvis and limbs. Relax all nerves of the\r\npelvis at pubes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND EXAMINATION.\r\n\r\nCaution: Wait a few hours; examine os again. If still closed and no\r\nperiodical pains are present, you are safe to leave case in the hands of\r\nthe nurse, instructed to send for you if regular pains return at\r\nintervals. On your return, explore os again, if found to open as large\r\nas a dime, you are by this notified that labor has begun its work of\r\ndelivery. You now place patient on her back, propped to an easy angle of\r\nnear thirty degrees, with rubber blanket in place. After you find os,\r\ndilated to nearly the size of a dollar, then relax nerves at pubes. Soon\r\nyou will find in mouth of womb an egg-shaped pouch of water, which you\r\nmust not press with fingers till very late in labor, for fear of\r\nstopping labor for perhaps many hours. Remember the head can and does\r\nturn in pelvis to suit the easiest passage through the bones, while in\r\nthe fluids of the amniotic sack. Now, as you know why not to rupture\r\nsack and spill fluids, you are prepared to proceed to other duties,\r\nwhich are to prevent rupture of perineum. Place the left hand on the\r\nbelly, about two inches above symphesis and push the soft parts down\r\nwith the left hand; support the perineum with the right hand until head\r\npasses over. This is necessary to prevent rupture of perineum.\r\n\r\n\r\nLASCERATION NEED NOT OCCUR.\r\n\r\nIf you follow this law of nature, lasceration may occur in one out of a\r\nthousand cases, and you will be to blame for that one, and may be\r\ncensured for criminal ignorance. Now you have conducted head safely\r\nthrough pelvis and vagina to the world. You will find pains stop right\r\nshort off for about a minute, which is the time to learn whether the\r\nnavel cord is wrapped around the child's neck.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE OF CORD.\r\n\r\nIf it is found all around the neck once or more, you must slip finger\r\ndown neck and loosen cord to let blood pass through the cord till next\r\npain comes, in order to ward off asphyxia of child.\r\n\r\nWhen pain comes, gently pull child's head down toward the bed. There is\r\nno danger of hurting the perineum now since the head has passed the soft\r\nparts. At this time the danger is suffocation of child. Never draw child\r\ntoo far away from mother's birth place by force, as you may tear navel\r\nstring from the child and cause it to bleed to death. If you value the\r\nlife of the child, then you must be careful not to place the navel end\r\nof the string in any danger of being torn off. Now you have made a good\r\njob for both mother and child so far. The child is in the world; and you\r\nwant to show the mother a living baby for her labor and suffering of the\r\npast nine months. The baby is born and the mother is not torn, but the\r\nbaby has not yet cried. Turn it on its side, face down, run your finger\r\nin its mouth and draw out all fluids, thick or thin, to let the breath\r\npass to the lungs. Then blow cold breath on its face and breast to cause\r\nits lungs to act.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEVERING CORD.\r\n\r\nBaby cries, all is safe now. Baby is born safely and cries nicely, but\r\nstill has cord fastened to afterbirth. It has no further use for cord,\r\nas life does not depend upon blood from the afterbirth any longer. Take\r\nthe cord about three inches from the child's belly, between thumb and\r\nfinger, and strip towards child to push bowels out of the cord if there\r\nshould be any in it, as a safeguard for bowels, then tie a strong string\r\naround cord, first three inches from child's belly, second, four inches;\r\ntake the cord in your hand and look what you are doing. If baby's hand\r\nshould fall back to cord, you might cut off one or two fingers, or wound\r\nthe hand or arm very seriously. Cut cord between the two ties just made\r\non navel string. Look out for your scissors; pass the child over to the\r\nnurse to be washed and dressed, while you deliver the afterbirth from\r\npelvis or womb.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUTTING ON BELLY BAND.\r\n\r\nWhen the child's shirt is on, cut a hole the size of your thumb in a\r\ndoubled piece of cloth, five inches long by four wide, put the hole two\r\ninches from one end, and run the cord through the hole. Lay the cloth\r\nacross the child's belly, then fold the cloth lengthwise over the cord,\r\nwhich must lie across the child so it will not stretch cord by handling\r\nor straightening child out. Now you are ready to finish the delivery of\r\nthe afterbirth. You have a plug of soft and tender flesh to get out of\r\nthe womb and vagina.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELIVERY OF AFTERBIRTH.\r\n\r\nAs the afterbirth has been grown tight to the womb during all the days\r\nof mother's pregnancy, and furnished all the blood to build and keep the\r\nchild alive in the womb for nine months, it has done all it can do for\r\nthe child, and is now ready to leave the womb.\r\n\r\nYou are there to assist it to get out of the place it has occupied so\r\nlong. You must begin first to rotate or roll the placenta first one way\r\nand then another, up, down and across the vagina, by gently pulling the\r\ncord. Look out or you will pull the cord loose from the placenta; then\r\nyou will have made your first blunder,--no cord to pull placenta with,\r\nand the mother bleeding and faint from loss of blood. Now is the time\r\nand place to save life. Pass your hand forward into the soft parts to\r\nget your fingers behind the placenta; now give a rolling pull and bring\r\nit out with the hand. You will find it an easy matter to get your hand\r\ninto the vagina and womb after the birth of the child. Get all the\r\nplacenta out, then take a wad of cloth or rags as large as the child's\r\nhead, and press it under the cross bone of the pelvis; push the cloth\r\nunder and up, so as to completely plug the pelvis. Now pull the hair\r\ngently over the symphesis, which will cause the womb to contract by\r\nirritation.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARING FOR MOTHER'S COMFORT.\r\n\r\nAll is now done but to provide for the mother's comfort, which is your\r\nnext duty. Draw her chemise down her back and legs until it is straight,\r\nthen with safety pins, pin the chemise on inner side of thighs so that\r\nthe chemise will go around both thighs separately. Now you have the\r\nshirt fast to keep it from sliding upwards, and you are ready to make a\r\nband of the chemise to support the womb and abdomen. Bring the chemise\r\ntightly together for two or three inches above the pelvis to form a\r\nband. Previous to pinning, draw the lump (womb) you feel above\r\nsymphesis, up, then pin, and the belt you have made of the chemise will\r\nsupport the womb. All is safe now, but you must not leave for two hours.\r\nYou may have delivered a feeble woman, who may flood to death after\r\ndelivery of the child, if you do not leave her safe. I have in mind one\r\ncase who flooded all of two quarts at a single dash. The first symptom\r\nwas a pain in the head.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOST-DELIVERY HEMORRHAGE.\r\n\r\nI know of only two causes that would produce hemorrhage or bleeding\r\nafter the child is delivered. One is when the afterbirth (placenta), is\r\nseparated from its attachment to the womb and still retained in the\r\nwomb or vagina, or when a part is separated and still lies in the womb,\r\nthat retention of placenta prevents the natural circular contraction of\r\nthe womb, to close on itself and retain it, with force enough to prevent\r\nthe further discharge of blood, would give a chance for a continued\r\nstream. Then should the patient bleed profusely after the placenta has\r\nbeen removed, another cause would be in pulling away the afterbirth, as\r\npart of the upper portion of the womb may be pulled to an inverted\r\nposition, which would be like a hat if you press the top down with the\r\nhand. Then there is a chance for leakage because of this unnatural fold\r\nmade in the womb.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT FOR.\r\n\r\nMy method of relief is to insert the hand, and with back of fingers\r\nsmooth out all folds. Before you draw the right hand from the womb place\r\nleft hand on abdomen, catch the womb between the thumb and finger and\r\nwithdraw hand. With the left hand pull the hair above symphesis or\r\nscratch the flesh just above across the region of the symphesis, just\r\nenough to make an irritation. After the hand is out of vagina pass a\r\nsmall bundle of cloths as far under the symphesis as would be necessary\r\nto hold everything up, then fasten chemise; beginning at symphesis draw\r\nit tight for about two inches above symphesis and with strong pins\r\nfasten it. Be sure you keep garment tight by pulling down between limbs.\r\nThe coarser the chemise the better, as you want to make a strong bandage\r\nat that point so as not to push the womb down into the pelvis. If the\r\npatient's general health is fairly good let her tell you what she wants\r\nto eat, and go and get it. Let her diet be after her usual custom. You\r\nmust remember she has just left the condition of a full abdomen. Lace\r\nher up, fill her up and make her comfortable for six hours; then change\r\nher bedding.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOD FOR MOTHER.\r\n\r\nRemember this, if you stop digestion on her for some hours with teas,\r\nsoups and shadows to eat, you carry her to the condition where it would\r\nbe dangerous to give her a hearty meal. My experience and custom for\r\nforty years has been crowned with good success. I never lost a case in\r\nconfinement. I have universally told the cook to give her plenty to eat.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT FOR SORE BREAST.\r\n\r\nIf she begins to have fever followed by chilly sensations, with swelling\r\nof one or both breasts, I relieve that by laying her arm ranging with\r\nher body. Let some one hold the arm down to the bed, then I place both\r\nof my hands under the arm, pull it up with considerable force till I\r\nget it as high or higher than normal position of the shoulder. Then pull\r\nher shoulder straight out from the body a fairly good pull, then pull\r\nthe arm up on a straight line with the face, and be sure that you have\r\nlet loose the axillary and mammary veins, nerve and artery, which have\r\nbeen cramped by pulling the arm down during delivery. No breast should\r\nbecome caked in the hands of an Osteopath. Do not bother about the\r\nbowels for two or three days. It may be necessary to use the catheter if\r\nthe water should fail to pass off after inhibiting the pubic system.\r\nThis is straight mid-wifery and will guide you through at least in\r\nninety per cent of the cases you will meet in normally formed women.\r\n\r\nRight here I wish to say one word: I think it is very wrong to teach,\r\ntalk and spend so much time with pictures, cuts, talks and lectures, and\r\nhold up constantly to the view of the student, births coming from the\r\nworst imaginable deformities and call that a knowledge of mid-wifery. It\r\nis normal mid-wifery you want to know and be well-skilled in. The\r\nabnormal formations are few and far between, and when a case of that\r\nkind does appear, it is your knowledge of the normal that guides you\r\nthrough the variations. You will very likely never find two abnormals\r\npresenting the same form of bone. As this is intended to only present\r\nto the student natural delivery I will let the subject drop with one\r\nword about the sore tongue of the mother. Adjust her neck, relieve\r\nconstrictor and all other muscles that would impede any blood vessel\r\nthat should drain the mouth and tongue. Remember this, that a horse that\r\nis always hunting bugars never finds a smooth road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nCONVULSIONS.\r\n\r\n     Old Phrases--Results of Stoppage of Fluids--Old Theory of\r\n     Fits--What the Real Cause may be--Listen for the Cause--What is a\r\n     Fit--Sensory System Demanding Nourishment--The Causes--The\r\n     Remedy--Dislocation of Atlas and of Four Upper Ribs.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD PHRASES.\r\n\r\nAs old phrases that have long been in use as names for the various\r\ndiseases have almost grown to the degree of disgust, I laid them aside\r\nand have been trying and have succeeded in unfolding natural laws to a\r\nbetter understanding, which do and should be our guide and action in\r\ntreating all diseases that mar the peace and happiness of the human race\r\nby misery and death. By such old systems with their foolish and\r\nunreliable suggestions, of how to guide the doctor in treating diseases\r\nwhich have proven unworthy of respect, if merit is to be our rule of the\r\nweights and measures of intelligence. I have become so disgusted with\r\nsuch verbiage with the sense that follows the pens that have written\r\ntreatise on disease, that I have concluded to do like Adam of old, give\r\nnames that may appear novel to the reader when I wish to draw the\r\nattention of the student who is trying to obtain a knowledge of the\r\nmysteries hitherto unsolved and unexplained. We have panned and washed\r\nby their suggestions and have obtained no gold. There are two very large\r\nand powerful rivers passing their fluids in opposite directions over a\r\nterritory that I will call the Klondike of life. This territory is\r\nbounded on the east by a great wall, which according to the old books\r\nhas been called the diaphragm, through which comes forth a great river\r\nof life that spreads all over the plains of the anterior lumbar region.\r\nOn that plain we find a great system of perfect irrigation of cities,\r\nvillages, and fertile soils of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESULT OF STOPPAGE OF FLUIDS.\r\n\r\nThis region of country covers one of the greatest and most fertile\r\nfields of life producing elements, and places them on the thoroughfares,\r\nand sends them back over the great central railroad, the thoracic duct,\r\nfrom lymphatics of the whole abdomen, to the heart and lungs to be\r\nconverted into a higher order of living matter. When finished it is\r\ncalled blood, to sustain its own machinery, and all other machines of\r\nthe body, giving rise to the mental question: \"What would be the effect\r\nproduced to life and health, if we should cut off, dam up or suspend the\r\nflowing of the aorta as it descends close by the vena cava and thoracic\r\nduct as they return with contents through the diaphragm on their journey\r\nto the heart and lungs for manufacture and finish. And after having\r\nsupplied the plain, what would be the effect if the vena cava and its\r\nsystem of drainage, and the thoracic duct should be dammed up so that\r\nchyle and blood could not be carried to the heart and lungs for renewal,\r\npurification, and finish. How much thought would be required to see that\r\nby stopping the arterial flow or that of the vena cava an irritating and\r\nfamishing condition would ensue, with congested veins, lymphatics and\r\nall organs of the abdomen, to that condition called fermentation,\r\ncongestion and inflammation, which in time is thrown off by sloughing\r\naway the substances of the lymphatics of the whole abdominal system of\r\nglands that belong to a liver, a kidney, the uterus and the bowels, to\r\nthe condition that has long since been a mystery, and called typhoid\r\nfever, dysentery, bilious fever, periodical spasms, and on through the\r\nwhole list of general and special diseases of winter and summer. I would\r\nadvise the practicing Osteopath to do some very careful panning up and\r\ndown the rivers of this Klondike, for if you fail to find gold, and much\r\nof it, you had better spend the remainder of your life where reason\r\ndwelleth not. Ever remembering that ignorance of the geography and\r\ncustoms of this country is the wet powder of success.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD THEORY OF FITS.\r\n\r\nWe often see a woman or man afflicted with fits or falling sickness\r\nwhich the doctor has failed to cure. What is a fit? For want of a better\r\nknowledge we have an established theory that \"hysteria\" is purely her\r\nimagination and as we must respect old theories, we will call it a fit\r\nof meanness. This is what we have had for breakfast, dinner and supper\r\nand we are asked to respect such trash because of the \"established\r\ntheories.\"\r\n\r\nWe are instructed by the universal \"all\" of the graduates of various\r\nmedical schools to call her a criminal and proceed to punish her with a\r\nwet towel, well twisted, and administered freely--more comprehensively\r\nexpressed by the term \"spanker\" and \"spank her\" very much--late from\r\nScotland with all Europe, and schools in America, except the American\r\nSchool of Osteopathy, which recommends to \"wallop\" and \"wallop\" very\r\nfreely the empty headed schools and theories that have no more sense\r\nthan to torture a sick person and do so to disguise their ignorance of\r\nthe cause of her disease, which is shown by the spasmodic effect that\r\nhas been named by a little book of guess work, generally called and\r\nuniversally known as symptomatology.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT THE REAL CAUSE MAY BE.\r\n\r\nNot a single author has hinted or in any way intimated that the cause of\r\nher disease is a failure of the passing of the blood, chyle and other\r\nsubstances to and from the abdomen to nourish and renovate the abdominal\r\nviscera caused by a prolapsed diaphragm, which would cause resistance to\r\nthe passing of the aorta, through which passes the arterial blood\r\nthrough the crura, and the vena cava that returns the venous blood, and\r\nthrough which crura the chyle is conducted from the receptaculum chyli\r\nbefore decomposition by fermentation sets up.\r\n\r\n\r\nLISTEN FOR THE CAUSE.\r\n\r\nThe afflicted is intoxicated. Here is where she gets a poisonous alcohol\r\nand will never be relieved permanently until the \"wet towel\" of reason\r\nhas slapped on both sides of the attending physician's head, so he can\r\nhear the squeezing and rattling of regurgitation, and straining and\r\ncreaking of the fluids in their effort to pass through that great and\r\nstrong towel called the diaphragm. Until he learns this I would apply\r\nthe wet towel of reason to the doctor, for fear he becomes lukewarm in\r\nhis studies and gives his patient a hypodermic injection of morphine,\r\nwhich is the advice as given at the last council of medical men who\r\npractice \"old established\" theories rather than be honest enough to say:\r\n\"The woman is sick and I know it, but I do not know the cause of her\r\ntrouble.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS A FIT?\r\n\r\nWhat is a fit? If God's judgment is to be respected a fit is the\r\nlife-saving step and move, perfectly natural, perfectly reasonable, and\r\nshould be so respected and received as divinely wise, because on that\r\nnatural action which is produced on the constrictor nerves first, then\r\nthe muscles, nerves, veins and arteries with all their centers. It\r\nappears at this time that the vital fluids have all been used up, or\r\nconsumed, by the sensory system, and in order to be temporarily\r\nreplenished, this convulsion shows its natural use by squeezing vital\r\nfluids from all parts of the body to nourish and sustain the sensory,\r\nwhich has been emptied by mental and vital action, until death is\r\ninevitable without this convulsing element to supply the sensory system,\r\nthough it may be but a short time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSENSORY SYSTEM DEMANDING NOURISHMENT.\r\n\r\nThe oftener the fits come, the oftener the nutrient system of the\r\nsensory cries aloud in its own, though unmistakable language, that it\r\nmust have nourishment, that it may run the machinery of life, or it must\r\ngive up the ghost and die. In this dire extremity and struggle for\r\nlife, it has asked the motor system to suspend its action, use its power\r\nand squeeze out of any part of the whole body though it be the brain\r\nitself, a few drops of cerebro-spinal fluid, or anything higher or\r\nlower, so it may live.\r\n\r\nThose of you acquainted with the fertile fields of the Klondike referred\r\nto, will be enabled to furnish the sensory system with such nutriment,\r\nas will not make it necessary to appeal to you through the language used\r\nby the unconscious convulsions with all their horrible contortions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSES.\r\n\r\nThus you surely see with the microscope of reason that the sensory\r\nnerves must be constantly nourished, and that all nutriment for the\r\nnerves must be obtained from the abdomen, though its propelling force\r\nshould come directly from the brain.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REMEDY.\r\n\r\nThe nerve courses from the brain must be unobstructed from the cerebrum,\r\ncerebellum, the medulla oblongata, and on through the whole spinal cord;\r\nwith a normal neck, a normal back, and normal ribs, which to an\r\nOsteopath means careful work, with power to know, and mind to reason\r\nthat the work is done wisely to a finish. I hope that with these\r\nsuggestions you will go on with the investigation to a satisfactory\r\ndegree of success.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISLOCATION OF THE FOUR UPPER RIBS.\r\n\r\nI wish to insert a short paragraph on a few effects following a down,\r\nfront, and outer dislocation of the four upper ribs of either side. We\r\nhave been familiar with asthma, goitre, pen-paralysis, shaking palsy,\r\nspasms, and heart diseases of various kinds. We have been as familiar\r\nwith the existence of those abnormal variations as we are of the rising\r\nand the setting of the sun. Our best philosophers on diseases and causes\r\nhave elaborately written and published their conclusions, and the world\r\nhas carefully perused with deep interest, what they have said of all the\r\ndiseases above named, also diseases of the lung, and to-day we are by\r\nthem left in total darkness as to the cause of the above named diseases,\r\nalso fits, insanity, loss of voice, brachial agitans, and many other\r\ndiseases of the chest, neck and head. As the field is open and clear for\r\nany philosopher to establish his point of observation, note and report\r\nwhat he observes, I will avail myself of this opportunity, and say in a\r\nvery few words, I have found no one of the diseases above indicated to\r\nhave an existence without some variation of the first few of the upper\r\nribs of the chest. With this I will leave farther exploration in the\r\nhands of other persons; and await the report of their observations pro\r\nand con.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nCONCLUDING REMARKS.\r\n\r\n     Thoughts for Consideration--Offering a New Philosophy--Lymphatics\r\n     and Fascia--A Satisfactory Experiment--Natural Washing Out.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOUGHTS FOR CONSIDERATION.\r\n\r\n\"Let us not forget the assembling of ourselves together.\" Whether this\r\nquotation applies to us or not, as an Osteopath I will venture to say\r\nthat the honored dead, and the honest living intelligent healers of all\r\nschools, and all systems of trying to relieve our race from disease and\r\nsuffering, so far as I have been able to ascertain, have been forced to\r\nguess how to proceed when they enter the \"sick room\" for want of a\r\nphilosophical system of procedure. We have collected together many or\r\nfew symptoms, named the disease, opened the battle, and on our side have\r\nmet the enemy and fought bravely all battles very much the same way. I\r\nhave spent one-half of a century in the field trying the many methods of\r\nattacks; and used the best arms and ammunition to date, and designed to\r\ndo the greatest good. For twenty years or more I was content to be\r\ngoverned by the opinions and customs of older and more experienced\r\nphysicians. I gave the disease its proper name. I gave the medicine as\r\ntaught and practiced, but was not satisfied that the line of procedure\r\nwas philosophically correct.\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFERING A NEW PHILOSOPHY.\r\n\r\nI believe at the present time I am fully prepared to say I can offer you\r\na more rational philosophy of what should be the physician's first\r\nobject, when called to repair a vessel that has become unseaworthy by\r\naccumulated barnacles, and is placed upon the dry dock for restoration\r\nto that condition called seaworthy, again. I believe this philosophy\r\nwill sustain the strongest minds in the conclusion that our first and\r\nwisest step to successfully combat all diseases would be to inhibit\r\nfirst the nerves of the lymphatics, then produce muscular constricture\r\nand cause them to unload their diseased contents, and keep them\r\nunloading until renovation is absolutely complete; leaving the\r\nlymphatics in a purely healthy state, and keep them in this condition at\r\nany period of the disease. I have long since been of the opinion that if\r\nwe could keep all impurities from accumulating in the lymphatics, and\r\nnever allow them to become overloaded, we would have no such diseases as\r\nbilious fever, typhoid, mountain fever, malaria, pneumonia, flux, heart\r\ndisease, brain disease, fits, insanity and on to the whole list of\r\nclimatic troubles, and the troubles with the changes of winter and\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\n\r\nLYMPHATICS AND FASCIA.\r\n\r\nI have thought for many years that the lymphatics and cellular system of\r\nthe fascia, of the brain, the lungs, and the heart throughout the whole\r\nsystem of blood supply, do get filled up with impure and unhealthy\r\nfluids, long before any disease makes its appearance, and that the\r\nprocedure of changes known as fermentation, with its electromagnetic\r\ndisturbances, were the cause of at least ninety per cent of the diseases\r\nthat we labor to relieve by some chemical preparation called drugs. When\r\nI was fully satisfied that we were liable to do more harm than good with\r\nsuch remedies, I began to hunt for more reasonable methods to relieve\r\nthe system of its poisonous gases and fluids, through the excretory\r\nsystem of the lymphatics and other channels, through which we had hoped\r\nto renovate and purify the system.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SATISFACTORY EXPERIMENT.\r\n\r\nFor twenty-five years I have tried to balance myself, divert my mind\r\nfrom all previous methods and see if I could not get more directly to\r\nthe lymphatic system of nerves, and cause the millions of vessels known\r\nto exist in the body to begin to unload their contents and continue\r\nthat action until all impurities were discharged by way of the bowels,\r\nlungs, kidneys and porous system.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL WASHING OUT.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of this philosophy I will endeavor to explain just how\r\nnature has provided to ward off diseases, by washing out before\r\nfermentation should set up in the lymphatics, from being received and\r\nretained the length of time, that destructive chemical changes would\r\nbegin its work of converting elements into gas and discharging them from\r\nthe system as unsuitable for nutriment. In order to avoid this calamity\r\nwe are met with two important thoughts, one of the power of the nerves\r\nof the lymphatics to dilate and contract, also that of fascia and\r\nmuscle, to dilate or constrict with great force when necessary to eject\r\nsubstances from gland, cell, muscle and fascia. Thus we see a cell\r\nloaded to fullness by secretion which it cannot do without; open-mouthed\r\nvessels through which it receives this fluid. Then again the system of\r\ncellular sphincters must dilate and contract in order to retain the\r\nfluids in those cell-like parts of the body. Now we are at the point\r\nwhen ready for use in other parts of the system, those sphincters must\r\ntemporarily give away, that the gland may relax and dilate. Then the\r\nuniversal principle of constriction throughout the whole body can\r\ndischarge the contents of the lymphatics of all divisions of the body,\r\nwhich is surely the normal condition. Let the lymphatics always receive\r\nand discharge naturally. If so we have no substance detained long enough\r\nto produce fermentation, fever, sickness and death.\r\n\r\nI think this thought has been presented plainly enough to be fully\r\nunderstood and practiced by the reader, if an Osteopath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTHE SUPERIOR CERVICAL GANGLION.\r\n\r\n     With what it has Communication--Its Position--One of its\r\n     Functions--Stimulation or Inhibition--Results Produced.\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH WHAT IT HAS COMMUNICATION.\r\n\r\nEvery ganglion on the great chain of the sympathetic nerve has special\r\nand important functions, but upon the superior cervical falls the\r\ngreatest burden of responsibility. This ganglion has communication with\r\na greater number of nerves and organs than any other; is in direct\r\ncommunication with three cranial and four cervical nerves, indirectly\r\nwith four more cranial nerves, and enters, by its branches into the\r\nformation of a large number of plexuses. Through this ganglion it is\r\nthat much Osteopathic work is done, and the purpose of this brief paper\r\nis to point out some of the many effects which may be produced by its\r\nstimulation or inhibition.\r\n\r\n\r\nITS POSITION.\r\n\r\nAnatomically we know that the superior cervical ganglion is situated in\r\nrelation to the transverse processes of the upper three cervical\r\nvertebrae. It gives off branches which communicate directly with the\r\nvagus, glosso-pharyngeal and hypoglossal nerves; another branch, the\r\nascending, passes into the carotid canal and enters into the formation\r\nof the carotid and cavernous plexuses; other branches pass to the\r\npharynx, and a branch enters the formation of the cardiac plexuses. From\r\nthe carotid and cavernous plexuses pass many nerves, only a few of which\r\nneed special mention; one unites with the great superficial petrosal to\r\nform the Vidian nerve which goes to _Meckel's_ ganglion, branches pass\r\nto the Gasserian ganglion, while we have others passing to the third,\r\nfourth, the ophthalmic division of the fifth and the sixth nerve, also\r\nwe have derived from the nerve the sympathetic root of the lenticular\r\nganglion.\r\n\r\n\r\nONE OF ITS FUNCTIONS.\r\n\r\nPhysiologically we know that one of the special functions of the\r\nsympathetic nervous system is to control the tone of non-striate\r\nmuscular tissue, and that we have filaments distributed from the\r\nsympathetic system in the muscular wall of every blood vessel, duct and\r\norgan throughout the body. We also know that the sympathetic is the\r\naccelerator nerve of the heart, being opposed in its action by the vagus\r\nwhich, is inhibitory; further, that the vagus is constant in its\r\nbrake-like action, while the sympathetic only acts when stimulated\r\neither directly or reflexly. While the vagus is inhibitory to the heart\r\nit is motor to the lungs. Nerve force is not generated in the\r\nsympathetic system; the cerebro-spinal nerve force is conveyed to the\r\nganglia by the rami communicantes and in the ganglia is transformed into\r\nsympathetic nerve force. We might compare the ganglia to electrical\r\ntransformers. Such being the case it is not difficult to see that if the\r\nsuperior cervical ganglion receives the nerve-force for transformation\r\nfrom the upper four cervical nerves and we can prevent, or lessen, the\r\npassage of nerve-force from the spinal cord through those nerves to the\r\nganglion, that we will, to a corresponding degree, lessen the amount of\r\nsympathetic nerve-force transformed in the ganglion and transmitted from\r\nit by its branches.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTIMULATION OR INHIBITION.\r\n\r\nWe can produce stimulation or inhibition of a nerve at will; press\r\nsuddenly and with a little violence upon the ulnar nerve where it lies\r\nin relation with the internal condyle of the humerus and we will find a\r\nmanifestation of its physiological action, evidenced by a sense of pain\r\nin the ulnar and radial sides of the fifth finger and the ulnar side of\r\nthe fourth, together with contraction of the muscles supplied by that\r\nnerve. But if our pressure be less intense and more prolonged we will\r\ninhibit the nerve and produce a sense of numbness in the same area\r\ntogether with temporary loss of muscular control.\r\n\r\nOsteopaths well understand how to produce either stimulation or\r\ninhibition of the ganglia by way of the nerves passing to them from the\r\nspinal cord, and the results of such inhibition or stimulation in any\r\nsympathetic area can be prophesied readily by anyone who has read with\r\nattention what I have written; for instance, in the case of inhibition\r\nin the region of the nerves supplying the superior cervical ganglion\r\nwith nerve force, we will find, first, throughout the area of\r\ndistribution of the branches of this ganglion a relaxation of the\r\nvascular walls. This will be marked by two indications, first, the skin\r\nwill become flushed and moist; second salivary secretion and lachrymal\r\nsecretion will be increased. Second, the vagus is now allowed full sway,\r\nand we will find slowing of the heartbeat. It is well known that\r\npressure over the seat of the first spinal nerve for a very brief period\r\nof time will control a congestive headache; the pressure in such case is\r\nmade only for so long time as to produce stimulation of the sympathetic\r\nto greater activity, when we will attain a vaso-constrictor action,\r\nlessen the volume of blood in the cranial cavity and so abolish the\r\nheadache. The arteries of the body may be divided into three groups, the\r\nlarge, the medium-sized and the small; in the first of these we find\r\nlittle muscular tissue and much elastic; in the second they exist in\r\nabout equal proportions, while in the small arteries we find much\r\nmuscular tissue and little elastic. As a consequence it is upon the\r\nsmaller arteries that the sympathetic system has its greatest effect. As\r\nwe dilate the smaller arteries and slow the heart action, it follows\r\nthat we reduce the blood pressure, as we reduce blood pressure we reduce\r\ntemperature, and within a very few minutes after the commencement of\r\nthis inhibitory pressure on the upper four cervical nerves we will find\r\nin the large majority of cases, the capillaries over the entire surface\r\nof the body flushed, this being accompanied by a fall in the pulse rate\r\nand a marked diminution of the temperature. Indirectly at the same time\r\nwe produce an effect upon the lungs; as we lessen blood pressure and the\r\nfrequency of the heart action we find in accordance with the\r\nphysiological rule an alteration in the respiration, it becomes slower\r\nand deeper. Arguing along these lines, and applying similar reasoning to\r\neach of the branches of this ganglion, anyone can trace out the many\r\nsubsidiary results which may be expected from either stimulation of the\r\nrami communicantes nerves distributed to it, or their inhibition.\r\nExactly similar rulings will find their prompt proof with regard to any\r\nother of the ganglia of the sympathetic system. We will find\r\ncorresponding results in the cases of the thoracic ganglia which form by\r\ntheir branches the pulmonic plexuses; we get the same results from the\r\nsplanchnic ganglia; while in the lumbar region we find that we have a\r\nready means of control of the vascular system in the lower abdomen and\r\npelvis. Much, very much, is still to be learned concerning the\r\nsympathetic nervous system, and all such increase in knowledge can come\r\nin one way only, clinical observation of Osteopathic treatment.\r\n\r\n   WILLIAM SMITH,\r\n   L. R. C. P. and S., (EDIN.), D. O.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nA. T. Still's Table or Device,\r\n\r\nThat He Has Constructed For\r\n\r\nTHE USE OF THE OPERATOR, THE EASE AND COMFORT OF THE PATIENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a welcome success and does away with the lubberly old tables. It\r\ngives ease and support to all classes of patients. By its use the\r\npatient can sit in a chair or on a stool and feel at perfect ease during\r\nall treatments, then the operator gets results and is not tired to death\r\nwhen he has treated a patient; knows and feels that there has been some\r\ngood done.\r\n\r\nThe asthmatic knows he has gotten help because pain has left his chest\r\nand he breathes as with new lungs; he knows he is helped more by one\r\ntreatment while sitting on a chair with his body easy and at rest in the\r\ncushioned swinging device than he would or has received by the best\r\nskill on any table. Then the operator says, \"Thank fortune, I am not\r\nworn out, and know I have gotten every bone to the place it belongs, and\r\nI know I have given satisfactory relief because my patients say so.\"\r\n\r\nI think to an operator this device is his best friend. With it well\r\nunderstood he can do as much work as three good operators can do on the\r\nold tables. Remember this device does no part of the treatment but\r\nplaces the patient to your convenience while you do the work.\r\n\r\nI feel as I am the discoverer of the device, that I know its needs and\r\nfeel free to advise pupils.\r\n\r\nThe device will cost you $25 only.\r\n\r\n   A. T. STILL,\r\n   Founder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American School of Osteopathy,\r\n\r\nKIRKSVILLE, MO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe course of study in The American School of Osteopathy is a carefully\r\ngraded one, and is divided into four terms, of five months each. The\r\nterms beginning September and February of each year. The course thus\r\nrequires two years for completion.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURSE OF STUDY.\r\n\r\nThe course of study extends over two years, and is divided into four\r\nterms of five months each.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST TERM.\r\n\r\nThe first term is devoted to Descriptive Anatomy including Osteology,\r\nSyndesmology and Myology; lectures on Histology illustrated by\r\nmicro-stereopticon; the principles of General Chemistry and Physics.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND TERM.\r\n\r\nThe second term includes Descriptive and Regional Anatomy; didactic and\r\nlaboratory work in Histology; Physiology; Physiological Chemistry and\r\nUrinalysis; Principles of Osteopathy; Clinical Demonstrations in\r\nOsteopathy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD TERM.\r\n\r\nThe third term includes Demonstrations in Regional Anatomy; Physiology;\r\nlectures in Pathology illustrated by micro-stereopticon; Symptomatology;\r\nPhysiological Psychology; Clinical Demonstrations in Osteopathy.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH TERM.\r\n\r\nThe fourth term includes Symptomatology; Minor Surgery; didactic and\r\nlaboratory work in Pathology; Psycho-Pathology; Gynæocology; Obstetrics;\r\nSanitation and Public Health; Venereal Diseases; Medical Jurisprudence;\r\nClinical Demonstrations; Clinical Practice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe school is open to students of both sexes without distinction, and\r\nall have equal opportunities and privileges, and are held to the same\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\nThe methods of instruction are such as obtain in the best academic and\r\ncollegiate institutions, and include recitations from standard\r\ntext-books, lectures, quizzes, practical laboratory work, and practical\r\nclinical work.\r\n\r\nThe equipment of the school is complete in every respect. The recitation\r\nand lecture rooms are amply provided with all necessary means of\r\nillustration, such as specimens fresh and preserved, skeletons, models,\r\ncharts, manikins and diagrams.\r\n\r\nThe respective laboratories are fitted up with all the necessary\r\napparatus for practical work in the Anatomical, Histological,\r\nMicroscopical, Chemical and Physiological departments.\r\n\r\nThe clinical facilities and opportunities enjoyed by students in this\r\nschool are exceptional. An abundance of material is always available for\r\nclinic demonstrations, which are continued daily through two terms, with\r\npractical work in the clinic operating rooms by each student, under the\r\ndirection of the regular operators, daily during the whole of the last\r\nterm.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the regular clinical department, the A. T. Still\r\nInfirmary has constantly under treatment from three hundred to five\r\nhundred patients, and although the students do not see these patients,\r\nthe many cases of diseases of all kinds under the care of the regular\r\noperators in the Infirmary give them constantly fresh and varied\r\nillustrations for use in their lectures. Sometimes, too, patients whose\r\ncases may be of special interest offer the use of their cases for the\r\npurpose of demonstration before the students.\r\n\r\nOpportunities are thus furnished to students for such practice and drill\r\nin the actual work of treating diseases as we believe is not equaled by\r\nany similar institution anywhere. The course of study is progressively\r\ngraded with a view to giving students a thorough and comprehensive\r\nknowledge of the facts and principles upon which their future work is to\r\nbe based. These clinic exercises in connection and immediately following\r\ngive them facility and readiness in the art of applying the facts and\r\nprinciples which they have acquired in recognizing and treating diseased\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nCatalogue mailed upon application. For information as to terms, etc.,\r\napply to\r\n\r\n   A. T. STILL,        AMERICAN SCHOOL OF OSTEOPATHY.\r\n   PRESIDENT.                   KIRKSVILLE, MO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe A. T. Still Infirmary\r\n\r\nCures by the Science of Osteopathy all Diseases Which are Known as\r\nCurable.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. A. T. STILL, founder of the Science of Osteopathy, has associated\r\nwith him, in his infirmary organization, the oldest and most successful\r\npractitioners and exponents of the science, selected with special\r\nreference to their fitness for the work of practically demonstrating the\r\nprinciples of Osteopathy and occupying positions as teachers and\r\nlecturers in the American School of Osteopathy. All are regular\r\ngraduates of this school.\r\n\r\nThe students in the school are not permitted to even assist in treating\r\nthe Infirmary patients. All the work is done by regular operators.\r\n\r\nThe examination previous to treatment is conducted by Dr. Still's three\r\nsons assisted by the operators. After examination the patient is\r\nassigned to the room in which he or she will receive treatment, and\r\nplaced under the care of an Osteopath best suited to the case.\r\n\r\nThe fees for treatment at the Infirmary are $25 per month. Where\r\npatients are unable to come to the Infirmary for treatment, an extra\r\ncharge of $1 to $2 per visit is added.\r\n\r\nThe Infirmary maintains a complete bathing department in charge of\r\ncompetent attendants. As good baths are therefore obtainable in\r\nKirksville as in any city. The charges are very moderate--twenty-five\r\ncents for a single bath, or $2.00 for a commutation ticket for ten\r\nbaths. When bath tickets are procured no other fees to attendants are\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nA representative of the Infirmary meets all trains, day and night, to\r\nhelp all patients who may need assistance and see that they are properly\r\ncared for.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPERATIVE SURGERY.\r\n\r\nTo correct a misapprehension on the part of many, it should be\r\nunderstood that the A. T. STILL INFIRMARY is fully prepared to receive\r\nand handle the most difficult cases requiring the highest order of\r\nskilled surgery, and it is not necessary to send such cases to the great\r\ncity hospitals in the east for even the most difficult and delicate\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nDr. J. B. Littlejohn, of the faculty, is a graduate in surgery from the\r\nUniversity of Glasgow, Scotland, and held for three years the position\r\nof Surgeon under the Government Board of England, besides other\r\nimportant and responsible positions in Europe and America.\r\n\r\nDr. Wm. Smith holds evidences of qualifications as follows: Licentiate\r\nof the Royal College of Surgery, Edinburg; Licentiate of the Royal\r\nCollege of Physicians and Surgeons, Glasgow; Licentiate in Midwifery,\r\nEdinburg and Glasgow; etc.\r\n\r\nCases requiring careful and delicate Surgery, the removal of fibroid\r\ntumors, and in fact any operation of whatever nature will receive the\r\nbest and most scientific treatment and care in this institution.\r\n\r\nThe management has now secured a powerful and perfect Roentgen or X-Ray\r\napparatus which will be used in connection with this department, in the\r\nexamination of difficult cases.\r\n\r\nPatients coming to the A. T. Still Infirmary may rely upon the fact that\r\nthey will in no case be subjected to unnecessary surgical operations, as\r\nthe knife is never used unless absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nAddress all letters of inquiry to\r\n\r\n   A.
