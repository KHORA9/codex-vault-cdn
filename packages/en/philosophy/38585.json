Linnell, PhD (2011)\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n----------\r\nThe \"Nei Ye\" or \"Nei Yeh\", variously translated as \"Inner Enterprise\",\r\n\"Inner Training\", \"Inner Cultivation\", or \"Inner Development\" (and\r\n\"Inward\" may be substituted for \"Inner\" in any of the previous), is\r\ngenerally considered to have been written around 350-300 BC (after\r\nConfucius, but before the Dao De Jing).  Its influence can be seen in many\r\naspects of Daoism (including the Dao De Jing itself) and in traditional\r\nChinese medicine.  It is a brief work (only 1/5 as long as the Dao De\r\nJing), written in short, often rhymed, verses.  It has been preserved in\r\nthe \"Guanzi\", a collection of diverse writings that was compiled during\r\nthe third century BC.  There is no name given for the author.\r\n\r\nWhile available for millennia, the Nei Ye has just started to receive\r\nserious scholarly attention in the last few decades.  It describes how to\r\nbuild up and store various spiritual forces such as Qi and \"essence\"\r\n(there is no indication that \"essence\" refers to reproductive fluids,\r\nwhich appeared later in Chinese thought), and how to control one's\r\nheart/mind.  It shows no influence of any school of Chinese religious or\r\nphilosophical thought, other than using a few basic Confucian terms.  It\r\ndoes have a few concepts in common with the work by Mencius, but as they\r\nwere probably both written about the same time it is impossible to tell\r\nwho influenced who (or if they were both influenced by something else).\r\n\r\nWhile the Nei Ye has many similarities, including writing style, with the\r\nDao De Jing, it also differs significantly in its perspective.  For\r\ninstance, there is no social commentary, no political or military advice,\r\nnor any explanation of how the universe was created or how it works. There\r\nis no mention of  yin and yang, \"non-action\" or \"non-being\", nor does it\r\nadvocate a feminine/receptive attitude.  It does not criticize\r\nConfucianism, nor does it present the sage as a person with some kind of\r\nbetter understanding of reality. Even the terms Dao and De apparently\r\ndon't mean the same thing in the Nei Ye as they do in the Dao De Jing -\r\nfor example, both Dao and De are described in some passages as being able\r\nto \"arrive\" and \"settle\" in a person.\r\n\r\nThere are two scholarly books that discuss the Nei Ye at length and\r\nprovide complete translations :\r\n\r\n   W. Allyn Rickett, \"Guanzi : Political, Economic, and Philosophical\r\n      Essays from Early China\", vol. 2, 1985 (revised 1998).\r\n\r\n   Harold D. Roth, \"Original Tao: Inward Training (Nei-yeh) and the\r\n      Foundations of Taoist Mysticism\", 1999.\r\n\r\nThere is also another very recent translation available on the web, that is\r\ncopyright-free as far as I can determine : \r\n\r\n   Robert Eno, \"Guanzi : The Inner Enterprise\", 2005\r\n      www.indiana.edu/~p374/Neiye.pdf\r\n\r\nTranslations often differ significantly because there are at least five\r\nearly manuscripts to draw upon, dating from around 1300 to 1600 AD.  In\r\naddition, Chinese scholars in the last few centuries have made many\r\nsuggested modifications to the existing original sources.  Attempting to\r\nreverse centuries of possible transcription errors, they replaced many\r\nsymbols which apparently make no sense with symbols that have a very\r\nsimilar shape and/or sound (often to complete a rhyme), and whose meaning\r\nseemed more appropriate. To make matters worse, there are no readily\r\navailable printed copies of the oldest manuscripts in their original form,\r\nso the Chinese symbols used for this work came from various web sites and\r\nwere cross-referenced against Roth's book (below).  Every care has been\r\ntaken to ensure that the symbols used here are correct, but how accurately\r\nthey match the original manuscripts is unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Translation Process\r\n-----------------------\r\nOften, translators just try to get the general \"feel\" of what the Chinese\r\nis trying to say, and then write an English sentence that means about the\r\nsame thing.  What I tried to do (for no other reason than to see if it\r\ncould be done) was to preserve as much of the original Chinese as possible\r\nby always using each symbol in the English sentence, and an exact\r\ntranslation of each symbol wherever possible, with as few added English\r\nwords as possible.  This sometimes results in sentences that are somewhat\r\nstilted in English, but that I hope retain more of the original Chinese\r\nway of thinking.  I also tried to use the same English word for the same\r\nChinese symbol whenever possible, so that the English reader could better\r\nsee what the writer(s) were trying to say. Occasionally more than one\r\nEnglish meaning for a symbol fits equally well, and the translator must\r\npick just one.  However, I sometimes took both meanings and combined them\r\ninto a single phrase, such as \"heart/mind\", or \"fair and just\". Exact\r\ntranslations are interpreted when they either don't make as much sense\r\nliterally, or when the resulting phrase would be awkward in English.\r\n\r\nThe approach used here for the corrected symbols was to always use the\r\noriginal symbol whenever possible, and only use a suggested correction\r\nwhen the original symbol makes no sense.\r\n\r\nWhile I originally intended to present each sentence \"as is\" (with no\r\nadditional interpretation of the sentence as-a-whole on my part), there\r\nare many sentences which do not seem to make sense without a context.  The\r\nmore I study the Nei Ye, the more I have come to believe that it is\r\ntalking about aligning the heart/mind, not the physical body, to receive\r\nDao, De, Qi and essence.  In particular, I believe that some references to\r\n\"form\" are referring to the \"form of the heart/mind\" (a phrase which is\r\nused explicitly three times), and so have added that phrase in two more\r\nplaces, indicated by [brackets].  In addition, a couple of references to\r\n\"returning\" are assumed to be referring to returning to one's nature (a\r\nphrase which is used explicitly once), and they are also indicated by\r\nbrackets. There are a few more personal assumptions indicated by brackets.\r\nOther scholarly and personal interpretations are explained in the\r\nfootnotes.\r\n\r\nThe section (---) and sub-section (blank line) divisions are entirely due\r\nto the hubris of the translator.  As far as I know, there are no section\r\nmarkers in the original manuscripts, because Rickett, Roth, and Eno often\r\nuse different divisions.\r\n\r\n\r\nDefinitions\r\n-----------\r\nSome of the  terms that are used repeatedly need to be discussed\r\nbeforehand for clarity :\r\n\r\nDao (Tao) : in the Dao De Jing, Dao is both the natural way of things and\r\nthe process of following that way; here, it is something that is essential\r\nfor life and that can dwell in the heart/mind; it is left untranslated so\r\nthat the readers may \"fill in the blank\" for themselves as they read\r\n\r\nDe (Te) : in the Dao De Jing, De is most often translated as \"virtue\" or\r\n\"power\" and is described in Chapter 49 as \"goodness\" or \"virtue\" and\r\n\"honesty\" or \"trust\"; here, it is something that can \"arrive\" in a person\r\nand is used daily; it is also left untranslated so that the readers may\r\n\"fill in the blank\" for themselves\r\n\r\n\"Qi\" (Ch'i) : vitality, life force, life energy, vital energy; it can also\r\nrefer to the breath; here, it is needed for life and dwells in the\r\nheart/mind, and is also left untranslated\r\n\r\n\"essence\" : this is also something that can \"arrive\" and \"settle\" in a\r\nperson, and is required for life\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that \"Qi\" and \"essence\" are very intimately linked, if\r\nnot actually referring to the exact same thing (but then why use two\r\nnames?). Both Qi and essence are required for life and can dwell within\r\nthe body, and there are lines apparently referring to the \"essence of Qi\"\r\nand the \"Qi of essence\".\r\n\r\nIt seems that the Nei Ye may be saying that Dao, De, Qi, and essence are\r\nall-pervasive spiritual things (as opposed to concepts) which are not\r\ninherently within us, but which can be obtained by taking (and keeping)\r\ncertain mental/emotional attitudes.  However, it is also possible that the\r\nNei Ye is using these terms to attempt to explain by allegory and metaphor\r\nthe various feelings experienced as a result of the meditative practices\r\nof the writer(s).  According to LaFargue, this interpretation is supported\r\nby the inconsistent \"definitions\" given of the various terms (and the\r\nrelationships between them), and by the sometimes experientially similar\r\ndescriptions of different terms. The readers can decide for themselves.\r\n\r\n\"heart/mind\" : usually translated as either \"heart\" or \"mind\" (the symbol\r\nmeans both), it seems that the ancient Chinese may have considered the \r\nheart to be the place of understanding, perception, and awareness, so \r\n\"heart/mind\" seems to be the best translation\r\n\r\n\"form\" : this appears to sometimes refer to the physical body, but often\r\nnot, because the \"form of the heart/mind\" is referred to several times\r\n\r\n\"properly aligned\" : literally just \"proper\" or \"correct\", this is taken\r\nto mean \"to bring into a proper or desirable relationship\"\r\n\r\n\"regulated\" : to be orderly, well governed, under control; guided by\r\ncertain rules or principles\r\n\r\n\"confused\" : the opposite of \"regulated\", and the normal state for most\r\npeople; caused by getting caught up in the ten thousand things, love and\r\nanger, worry and happiness, etc.\r\n\r\n\"thought\", \"intent\", \"desire\" : regardless of what it is called, as far as\r\nthe Nei Ye is concerned, it is sometimes a good thing, sometimes a bad\r\nthing; it seems to be a mixture of both thought and feelings (similar to\r\n\"heart/mind\"); \"intent\" is perhaps best because that has connotations of\r\nthought and emotion, but \"thought\" and \"desire\" sometimes work better in\r\nEnglish\r\n\r\n\"equable\" : while the symbol literally means \"even\", \"equal\", \"calm\",\r\nequable means to be steady, free from extremes, serene;  not to be\r\nconfused with \"equitable\" (unbiased)\r\n\r\n\"settled\" : has connotations of being calm as well as stable or rooted\r\n\r\n\"proper value\" : literally \"estimate\" (which is the process of judging the\r\nworth or value of something), this is taken to mean \"to have the proper\r\nperspective about the importance of a thing\"\r\n\r\n\"naturally\" : something that happens by itself, spontaneously, without\r\nbeing forced (\"of itself\", \"of its own accord\", \"on its own\")\r\n\r\n\"love\" : often translated as \"happiness\" or \"joy\" by others, this seems to\r\nbe happiness due to something or attached to something, so here it is\r\ntranslated as \"love\"\r\n\r\n\"heaven\" : a complex concept, this symbol has connotations of the sky,\r\nnature, and that which is the source of existence, as well as that of\r\nbeing a celestial god-like spirit, and that which controls our destinies\r\n\r\n\"the world\" : literally \"heaven under\", it is perhaps better thought of as\r\n\"all things under heaven\", but it is translated as \"the world\" because the\r\ngrammar sometimes gets awkward using the more accurate phrase\r\n\r\n\"heaven and earth\" : everything, the universe, all that is\r\n\r\n\"ten thousand creatures\" : \"ten thousand\" as used here does not refer to a\r\nspecific number, but means \"innumerable\" or \"myriad\"; together the symbols\r\nare perhaps better thought of as \"all creatures and things\" (including\r\npeople)\r\n\r\n\"duties\" : one's personal and business affairs and responsibilities\r\n\r\n\"sage\" : literally \"holy person\" or \"wise man\"\r\n\r\n\"always\" : the first symbol of the document, it is used many times\r\nthroughout the Nei Ye, and always starts a sentence.  Some translators\r\njust ignore it, but it seemed important to the writer(s), so I wanted to\r\nuse it, and consistently. The standard translation of \"all\" or \"every\"\r\nworks in some places, but not in many.  Another standard translation of\r\n\"earthly\" works everywhere, but sounds strange when referring to Dao\r\n(\"earthly Dao\"), and would seem to postulate a world-view (\"earthly Dao\"\r\nvs. perhaps \"heavenly Dao\"?) for which there is no other evidence.\r\nHowever, an interpreted translation of \"always\" works everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfucian concepts (marked by a * in the translation)\r\n------------------\r\n\"wise, wisdom\" : as it says\r\n\r\n\"kindness\" : benevolence, kindheartedness\r\n\r\n\"righteousness\" : doing the right thing, personal honor, knowing right\r\nfrom wrong, being morally upright\r\n\r\n\"propriety\" : proper etiquette, courtesy; being formal, respectful\r\n\r\n\"respect\" : an inner attitude of respectfulness and/or reverence\r\n\r\n\"noble man\" : literally \"son of the ruler\", it can mean \"nobleman\" (one\r\nwho belongs to the nobility), but also one who is noble or moral in\r\ncharacter; sometimes translated by others as \"gentleman\" or \"superior man\"\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n----------\r\nRobert Eno, \"Guanzi : 'The Inner Enterprise'\", 2005\r\nRussell Kirkland, \"Neiye : Inner Cultivation\", 1998\r\nRussell Kirkland, \"Varieties of Taoism in Ancient China\", 1997\r\nMichael LaFargue, \"Tao and Method\", 1994\r\nW.

then makes them live.\r\nBelow, it gives birth to the five grains;\r\nAbove, it acts to arrange the stars.\r\nWhen it flows in the space between heaven and earth\r\nWe call them ghosts and spirits.\r\nWhen it collects in the center of the breast of people,\r\nWe call them sages.\r\n\r\nThus the Qi of the citizens :\t\t\r\nIs it bright?\r\nAs though ascending to heaven.\r\nIs it dark and quiet?\r\nAs though entering into an abyss.\r\nIs it wide and spacious?\r\nAs though residing in the ocean.\r\nIs it close[A]?\r\nAs though residing in oneself.\r\n\r\nThus this Qi -  \t\t\t\r\nCan not be brought to rest by using force,\r\nBut can be calmed by using De.\r\nCan not be summoned by using your voice,\t\r\nBut can be made welcome by using your intent.\r\n\r\nWhen you can respectfully* maintain it, and never lose it,\r\nThis is called developed De.\t\t\t\r\nWhen De develops, and wisdom* arises,\t\r\nThe bounty of the ten thousand creatures is attained.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAlways : the form of the heart/mind is\t\t\r\nNaturally full, naturally overflowing,\r\nNaturally born, naturally complete.\t\t   \r\nThe reason that you lose it\t\t\t\t\r\nIs certainly due to worries and happiness, love and anger, desire for profit.\r\nIf you can leave behind worries and happiness, love and anger, desire for \r\n      profit,\r\nYour heart/mind then returns [to its original nature] successfully.\r\n\r\nThe nature of that heart/mind\r\nBenefits from calmness and the tranquility that comes from it.\r\nDo not be troubled, do not be confused,\r\nAnd harmony is then naturally achieved.\r\n\r\nIs it very bright?\r\nAs though located right by your side.\r\nIs it very easy to overlook?\t\r\nAs though it will never be attained.\t\t\t\t\r\nIs it very remote and indistinct?\r\nAs though utterly without boundaries.\r\n\r\nTo examine this, you need not go far :\r\nYou use De daily.\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNow : Dao is the reason that the form [of the heart/mind] is full!\r\nBut people can not be strong enough to keep it -\r\nIt goes and does not return,\r\nIt arrives but does not dwell.\t\r\n\r\nIs it silent? \r\nThere is no one who can hear its sound.\r\nIs it close[A]?\r\nIt is residing in the heart/mind.\r\nIs it very dim and obscure?\r\nYou can not see its form.\r\nIs it very prolific?\t\t\t\t\r\nIt gives us all life.\r\n\r\nYou can not see its form,\r\nYou can not hear its voice,\r\nYet there is an order to its accomplishments.\r\nWe call it Dao.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAlways : Dao is nowhere to be found,\t\r\nBut in a virtuous heart/mind it can calmly dwell.\r\nWhen the heart/mind is still and Qi is regulated,\r\nDao can then stay there.\r\n\r\nThat Dao is not remote :\r\nCitizens attain it by being born.\t\r\nThat Dao does not depart :\r\nCitizens rely on it for understanding.\r\n\r\nThus : is it close[A]?\t\t\t\t\r\nAs though it could be tied together with you.\r\nIs it very minute and subtle?\r\nAs though it is utterly nowhere to be found.\r\n\r\nThe nature of that Dao\r\nDetests thoughts and words about it.\t\r\nBut when you cultivate your heart/mind and still your thoughts,\r\nDao can then be attained.\t\t\t\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nDao - \r\nThat which your mouth can not speak!\r\nThat which your eyes can not see!\t\r\nThat which your ears can not hear!\r\nIt is the reason that we cultivate the heart/mind and properly align \r\n      [its][B] form!\r\nThat which when people lose, thus they die.\r\nThat which when attained, thus they are born!\r\nThat which when duties lose, thus they fail.\r\nThat which when attained, thus they are completed!\r\n\r\nAlways : Dao is \r\nWithout root, without stalk,\r\nWithout leaves, without flowers.\t\t\t\t\r\nBy means of it the ten thousand creatures are born,\r\nBy means of it the ten thousand creatures are made complete.\r\nThis [natural] order, it is called Dao.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThat which presides over Heaven is proper alignment, \t\r\nThat which presides over Earth is equability,\t          \r\nThat which presides over people is calmness and stillness. \r\n\r\nSpring, autumn, winter, summer -\r\nThe timing of heaven!\r\nMountains, hills, streams, valleys -\r\nThe limbs of the earth!\r\nLove, anger, taking, giving -\r\nThe schemes of the people!\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThus the sage :\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nTakes part in the changing of the seasons, but is not transformed;\r\nHe attends to creatures, but is not changed by them.\t   \t\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen you can be properly aligned and can be still[C] -\r\nThen, you can be settled.\r\nWith a settled heart/mind in your center,\r\nYour ears and eyes are acute and clear,\r\nYour four limbs are hard and strong,\r\nYou are able to become a dwelling for essence.\r\nThis essence -\r\nIs essence of Qi!\t\t\r\n\r\nWith Qi and Dao, then there is life;\r\nWith life, then there is contemplation;\r\nWith contemplation, then there is understanding;\r\nWhen you reach understanding, then stop!\t\r\nAlways : if the form of the heart/mind\t\t\t\r\nHas too much understanding, life is lost.\t\t\t\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nKnowing the Oneness[D] with creatures can transform them, \r\nWe call this being spirit-like[E].\t\t\t\t\r\nKnowing the Oneness with your duties can change them, \r\nWe call this being wise*.\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nTo transform creatures, without altering your Qi;\t\t\t\r\nTo change duties, without altering your wisdom*;[F]\t\t\r\nOnly a noble man* who maintains Oneness[G] \t\t\r\nCan do this!\r\n\r\nWhen he maintains Oneness[G] and does not lose it,\r\nHe can rule[H] the ten thousand creatures.\r\nA noble man* uses creatures,\t\t\t\t\r\nHe does not allow creatures to use[I] him.\t\t\t\r\n\r\nWhen he attains the regulation of Oneness : \t\t\t\r\nA regulated heart/mind resides in his center,\r\nRegulated speech comes from his mouth,\t\t\t\r\nRegulated duties are assigned to people.\t\t\t\t\r\nThen, the world is regulated!\r\n\r\nOne word[J] is attained by him, and the world obeys him; \t\r\nOne word[J] settles him, and the world listens to him.\r\nWe call him fair and just!\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf the form [of the heart/mind] is not properly aligned,\r\nDe will not arrive.\r\nIf the center is not still,\r\nThe heart/mind will not be regulated.\r\n\r\nWhen the properly aligned form takes in De,\r\nThe kindness* of heaven and the righteousness* of earth\r\nThen naturally arrive, and overwhelmingly.\t\r\n\r\nThis highest of spirit-like understanding[K] -\r\nIs it illuminating? \r\nYou will understand the ten thousand creatures.[L]\r\n\r\nMaintain the righteousness* of the center, and you will not err :\r\nDo not allow creatures to confuse your senses,\t\t\r\nDo not allow the senses to confuse your heart/mind.\t\t\r\nThis is called attaining the center.\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThere exists a spirit[-like understanding] naturally located in the self -\r\nOne moment it goes, one moment it arrives;    \r\nThere is no one who can contemplate it.\r\nLose it and you will certainly be confused,\r\nAttain it and you will certainly be regulated.\t\t\t\r\n\r\nRespectfully* empty its dwelling[M],\t\t\t\t\r\nAnd essence will naturally arrive.\r\nThis essence - consider it and contemplate it,\r\nRather than study ways to regulate it.\r\nKeeping a serious appearance, and an attitude of awe and respect*,\r\nEssence will arrive and settle.\r\n\r\nWhen you attain it and never let go of it,\t\t\t\r\nYour ears and eyes will be restrained,\t\t\r\nYour heart/mind will have no other plans.\r\nWith a properly aligned heart/mind located in the center,\r\nThe ten thousand creatures attain their proper value.   \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nDao fills the world \r\nEvery place the citizens are located,\r\nBut the citizens can not understand this! \r\n\r\nWith the liberation of one word[J] : \t\t\r\nYour head can observe what is in heaven,\t\r\nYour lowest extreme is on earth,\r\nAnd your coils fill the nine provinces.[N]\r\n\r\nWhat does it mean to be liberated by it?\t\r\nYou will reside in a calm heart/mind.\r\nI regulate my heart/mind and my senses are then regulated;\r\nI calm my heart/mind and my senses are then calm.\r\nThat which regulates them is the heart/mind!\r\nThat which calms them is the heart/mind!\r\nThe heart/mind thus contains a heart/mind;\t\r\nThe center of the heart/mind also has a heart/mind!\r\n\r\nIn that heart/mind of the heart/mind :\r\nThought thus comes before words;\r\nAfter thought comes form;\r\nAfter form comes words;\r\nAfter words comes manifestation;\t\t\r\nAfter manifestation comes regulation.\t\r\nWithout regulation, there will certainly be confusion;\t\r\nConfusion, then death.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhere essence exists, there is naturally life -\r\nOutside you, calmness flourishes;\t\t\t\r\nIt collects inside you, thus acting as a primal spring.\t\r\nLike a vast lake[O], it is harmonious and equable.\r\n\r\nIt thus becomes a fountainhead of Qi.\r\nAs long as the fountainhead does not dry up,\r\nThe four limbs are then strong.\r\n\r\nWhen the spring is not used up,\r\nThe nine bodily openings[P] are then open [to the flow of Qi].\r\nThen you can span the limits of heaven and earth,\r\nAnd cover the four seas[Q].\r\n\r\nWhen the center is without doubt or desire,\r\nThe outside is without demonic disasters.\t\t\t\r\nThose whose heart/mind is whole and complete in the center :\r\nTheir form is whole and complete on the outside,\r\nThey do not happen to meet heavenly disasters,\r\nThey do not encounter people who cause harm -\r\nWe call them sages.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen people can be properly aligned and still :\r\nTheir hair and skin are abundant and smooth,\t\t\r\nTheir ears and eyes are acute and clear,\r\nTheir muscles are supple and their bones are strong.\t\t\r\n\r\nThen they can support the great circle of heaven,\r\nAnd walk on the great square of earth.\r\nThey are a reflection of great purity,\t\t\t\t\r\nThey see with great clarity.\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nRespectful* and cautious, they are without error;\r\nEach day they renew their De.\t\t\t\t\r\nThey understand the whole world \t\t\t\r\nThoroughly out to the four extremes.\r\n\r\nThey respectfully* develop their fullness;\r\nThis is called inner attainment.\t\t\t\r\nHowever, if they do not return [to their original nature],\r\nThis creates errors.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAlways : Dao is \r\nCertainly complete, certainly all-pervasive,\t       \t\r\nCertainly magnanimous, certainly relaxed,\t\t\r\nCertainly hard, certainly strong.\r\n\r\nMaintain your virtue and never give up;\r\nTo pursue excess disperses and weakens it.\r\nOnce you understand the extremes,\t\t\t\r\nReturn to Dao and De.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen your whole and complete heart/mind is in the center,\r\nIt can not be hidden or concealed -\r\nIt is known in your form's appearance,\r\nIt is seen in your skin's color.\r\n\r\nWhen with virtuous Qi you meet people,\r\nThey will love you as they would their brothers.\t\r\nWhen with wicked Qi you meet people,\r\nThey will harm you with their weapons of war. \t\r\nBecause the sound of that which is un-spoken \r\nTravels faster than a clap of thunder.\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe form of the heart/mind's Qi\r\nIs brighter than the sun and moon,\r\nMore observant than a father or mother.\r\nRewards are not enough to encourage virtue,\r\nPunishments are not enough to discipline excesses.\r\nQi's intent is attained, and the world obeys; \t\t\r\nThe heart/mind's intent becomes settled, and the world listens.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nBecause they consolidate[R] Qi like spirits,\r\nThe ten thousand creatures are prepared for existence.\r\nCan you consolidate[R] it?\r\nCan you unify it?\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nCan you foretell bad fortune and good fortune, but without divining? \r\nCan you then stop? \r\nCan you?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nHow can you never seek it from anyone, \t\t\t\r\nYet attain it yourself? \t\t\t\t\t\r\nContemplate it, contemplate it, and again repeatedly contemplate it.\r\nShould you contemplate it yet not comprehend it,\r\nKnow that ghosts and spirits can comprehend it.\t\r\nHowever, it is not comprehended by the power of ghosts and spirits - \r\nBut by the utmost of essence's Qi!\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nOnce the four limbs are properly aligned,\t\t\r\nOnce blood and Qi are still :\t\t\t\t\r\nUnify your intent, consolidate[R] your heart/mind;\t\r\nAnd the ears and eyes will be restrained\t\t\r\nEven though what is remote seems near.\r\n\r\nDeep contemplation creates understanding;\t\t\r\nDisdain and laxity creates worries;\t\t\r\nCruelty and arrogance creates resentment;\r\nWorries and melancholy create sickness.\r\nSickness then causes death.\r\n\r\nIf you contemplate these and do not let go of them,\t\r\nInside you will be distressed, outside you will be weak.     \r\nDo not neglect[S] to make plans for this,\r\nOr life will leave its dwelling.\t\t\t\r\n\r\nDo not eat as if you were starving,\t\t\r\nDo not contemplate as if you were indifferent.\t\r\nWhen you restrain these appropriately and simultaneously,\r\nThat [Dao][T] will naturally arrive.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAlways : at the birth of people - \t\t\t\r\nHeaven produces their essence,\r\nEarth produces their form;\r\nThese combine in order to make people.\r\n\r\nWhen these are in harmony then there is life;\r\nNo harmony, no life.\r\nObserve the Dao of harmony :\r\nIts essence is not seen,\r\nIts manifestations are not wicked.\t\r\nWhen equability and proper alignment completely fill your breast, \r\nAnd the principles of regulation are in your heart/mind,\t\r\nThis gives long life.\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\nWhen love and anger lose their proper value, \t\t\r\nThen use this plan of action :\r\nRestrain your five desires[U],\t\t\t\t\t\r\nLeave behind your two misfortunes - \t\t\t\r\nDo not love, do not be angry.\r\nThen equability and proper alignment will completely fill your breast.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAlways : at the birth of people - \t\t\t\t\r\nThey certainly have equability and proper alignment.         \r\nThe reason that they lose it\r\nIs certainly due to love, anger, worries, suffering.\t\t\r\n\r\nThus : there is nothing that stops anger like poetry,\t\t\r\nThere is nothing that removes worries like music,\r\nThere is nothing that restrains music like propriety,*\r\nThere is nothing that maintains propriety* like respect*.[V]\r\n\r\n[But,] there is nothing that maintains respect* like stillness.\r\nInwardly still and outwardly respectful*, \t\r\nYou can return to your [original] nature,\t\r\nAnd your nature will be exceptionally settled.\t\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAlways : regarding the Dao of eating -\t\t\t\r\nOver-filling causes injury, and your form will not be right;\t\r\nOver-fasting[W] makes your bones wither and your blood congeal.\r\nWhen you reach the space between filling and fasting[W],\t\r\nThis is called achieving harmony -\r\nThat which is the dwelling place of essence \r\nAnd that which is the creation of understanding.\r\n\r\nWhen hunger and satiation lose their proper value,\t\t \r\nThen use this plan of action :\r\nWhen you are satiated, then move about quickly.\t\t\r\nWhen you are hungry, then neglect your contemplation.\r\nWhen you are old, then take charge of your concerns.\t\r\n\r\nIf you are satiated and do not move about quickly,\t\t\r\nYour Qi will be obstructed in your four extremities.\t\r\nIf you are hungry and do not neglect your contemplation,\r\nWhen you eat you will get full but you will not stop.\t\r\nIf you are old and do not take charge of your concerns,\t\r\nWhen you are distressed, then you will be quickly exhausted.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen you expand your heart/mind and free it,\t\t\r\nWhen your Qi is magnanimous and vast,\t\t\t\r\nWhen your form is calm and unchanging :\r\nYou can maintain Oneness[G] and reject the ten thousand trivialities, \r\nYou see profit and are not tempted,\r\nYou see trouble and are not frightened.\r\nYou are magnanimous, relaxed, and kind*;\t\t\t\r\nWhen alone, you are happy with your self.\t\t\t\r\nThis is called cloud-like Qi -\r\nYour intent and behavior resemble that of heaven.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAlways : at the birth of people - \t\t\t\t\r\nThey certainly have joy.\t\t\t\t\t\r\nWhen they are worried, then they lose these tenets[X].          \r\nWhen they are angry, then they lose the source.\t\t\r\nWhere there is worry, grief, love, anger,\r\nThen Dao does not dwell.\r\n\r\nLove and desire : still them.\r\nFoolishness and confusion : properly align them.\r\nWhen you do not pull and do not push,[Y]\r\nGood fortune will naturally return to you : \r\nThat Dao will naturally arrive,\r\nWhich you can rely on and consult with.\r\nWhen you are still, then you attain it,\t\t\t\t\r\nWhen you are impatient, then you lose it.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis potent Qi in your heart/mind : \t\t\t\t\r\nOne moment it arrives, one moment it departs.\r\nIt is so tiny there is nothing inside it,\t\t\t\t\r\nIt is so great there is nothing outside it.\t\t\t\r\n\r\nThe reason that you lose it\r\nIs because impatience causes harm.\t\t\t\t\r\nWhen the heart/mind can maintain stillness,\r\nDao will naturally settle there.\r\n\r\nFor people who attain Dao :\t\t\t\t\t\r\nRegulation supports it and it will not dissipate easily,\t\r\nSo that the center in their breast does not fail them.\r\nWhen following the Dao of restraining desire,\r\nThe ten thousand creatures do not cause harm.[Z]\r\n\r\n==========================================================================\r\n\r\nA : altho the modern translation of this symbol is \"sudden\" or \"abrupt\"\r\n(among other things), and is translated different ways by different \r\nauthors, I have chosen \"close\" (as in \"within reach\", \"accessible\") based \r\non the answers given each time this question is asked\r\n\r\nB : using \"its\" here (rather than \"the\") is significant, making the\r\ndifference between referring to the \"form of the heart/mind\" or referring\r\nseparately to \"the heart/mind\" and \"the form\"\r\n\r\nC : this and the next 5 lines could still be talking about the sage, but\r\nbecause it seems to be a different section, it is translated in this\r\nfashion\r\n\r\nD : Simonis claims that the grammatical sense in which \"one\" is being used\r\nmeans \"one-ing creatures\", hence knowing (or seeing, sensing, perceiving,\r\netc.) your oneness with them\r\n\r\nE : \"spirit-like\" is taken to mean that your understanding of Dao has\r\nreached the same level as that of the spirits, who are presumably not\r\nconfused by having senses or a heart/mind (from Simonis)\r\n\r\nF : in this and the 5 lines above, it is assumed that it is the creatures\r\nand duties that are being transformed and changed, because earlier it is\r\nsaid that the sage takes part in changes but is not himself transformed or\r\nchanged\r\n\r\nG : usually translated as \"grasps the One\" or \"holds to the One\" (the one\r\nwhat? principle? Dao?), \"maintaining Oneness\" is taken to mean being able\r\nto keep the sense of Oneness referred to above\r\n\r\nH : he \"rules\" creatures in that they do not confuse his senses or\r\nheart/mind (referred to below)\r\n\r\nI : creatures do not \"use\" him in that they do not confuse his senses or\r\nheart/mind (referred to below)\r\n\r\nJ : it is unclear what it meant here : \"one word\", \"one saying\", \"word of\r\nthe One\" (\"One\" perhaps referring to Dao?), \"word of Oneness\", \"sound of\r\nOneness\", possibly even \"the whole utterance\", etc.; so it is just left\r\nliterally translated as \"one word\"\r\n\r\nK : \"spirit-like understanding\" is taken to refer to a state of\r\nconsciousness where you can intuitively understand Dao very clearly (from\r\nSimonis)\r\n\r\nL : you will \"understand\" them in that you will understand their proper\r\nvalue (mentioned below), you will not allow them to confuse your senses or\r\nheart/mind (referred to immediately below), etc.\r\n\r\nM : presumably the heart/mind, or perhaps the \"center\"\r\n\r\nN : the image seems to be that of a dragon - your head is in heaven, your\r\ntail is on the earth, and your coils fill the \"nine provinces\" (the whole\r\nworld)\r\n\r\nO : this is usually translated as \"flood-like\" (to match Mencius), but\r\nliterally means \"like a vast body of water\", and a flood does not seem to\r\nbe as harmonious and equable as a wide, calm lake\r\n\r\nP : two eyes, two ears, one nose, one mouth, two elimination, one sexual\r\n\r\nQ : \"four seas\" also indicates the whole world\r\n\r\nR : there are three possible symbols here, \"to grasp or catch\" (which Roth\r\nsays is the original symbol), \"to roll into a ball with the hands\", and\r\n\"to concentrate\", and all are equally likely (as far as I can tell), so\r\nthe word used is a combination of all three\r\n\r\nS : the symbol given (\"flea\") makes no sense; however it seems that it\r\nmust complete a double negative (do not [neglect/hesitate/fail] to?),\r\nbecause twice below the Nei Ye encourages the reader to make plans\r\n\r\nT : there is no subject in this sentence in the original Chinese!  But the \r\nphrase \"that Dao\" is used four other times, and \"that Dao will naturally \r\narrive\" appears below (using different symbols)\r\n\r\nU : the five senses\r\n\r\nV : these 4 lines are expressing very Confucian ideas; Confucius himself\r\nsaid \"Let a person be stimulated by poetry, established in character by\r\nthe rules of propriety, and perfected by music.\" (Analects 8.8)\r\n\r\nW : the given symbol makes no sense here, but presumably means the\r\nopposite of \"gorging\"\r\n\r\nX : while the standard definition is \"discipline\", according to Waley it\r\nliterally means \"main thread\" (as in \"of the teaching\")\r\n\r\nY : presumably, do not pull desirable things towards you and push \r\nundesirable things away\r\n\r\nZ : creatures will not \"cause harm\" in that they will not confuse the\r\nsenses or the heart/mind (mentioned above)\r\n\r\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs \r\n3.0 Unported License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0).
