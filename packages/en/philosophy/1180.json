(1) As a guerdon they\r\nbestowed it upon Cheiron, (2) by reason of his uprightness, and he took\r\nit and was glad, and turned the gift to good account. At his feet\r\nsat many a disciple, to whom he taught the mystery of hunting and of\r\nchivalry (3)--to wit, Cephalus, Asclepius, Melanion, Nestor, Amphiaraus,\r\nPeleus, Telamon, Meleager, Theseus and Hippolytus, Palamedes, Odysseus,\r\nMenestheus, Diomed, Castor and Polydeuces, Machaon and Podaleirius,\r\nAntilochus, Aeneas and Achilles: of whom each in his turn was honoured\r\nby the gods. And let none marvel that of these the greater part, albeit\r\nwell-pleasing to the gods, nevertheless were subject to death--which\r\nis the way of nature, (4) but their fame has grown--nor yet that their\r\nprime of manhood so far differed. The lifetime of Cheiron sufficed for\r\nall his scholars; the fact being that Zeus and Cheiron were brethren,\r\nsons of the same father but of different mothers--Zeus of Rhea, and\r\nCheiron of the nymph Nais; (5) and so it is that, though older than all\r\nof them, he died not before he had taught the youngest--to wit, the boy\r\nAchilles. (6)\r\n\r\n (1) Or, \"This thing is the invention of no mortal man, but of Apollo\r\n    and Artemis, to whom belong hunting and dogs.\" For the style of\r\n    exordium L. Dind. cf (Ps.) Dion. \"Art. rhet.\" ad in.; Galen,\r\n    \"Isagog.\" ad in.; Alex. Aphrodis. \"Probl.\" 2 proem.\r\n\r\n (2) The wisest and \"justest of all the centaurs,\" Hom. \"Il.\" xi. 831.\r\n    See Kingsley, \"The Heroes,\" p. 84.\r\n\r\n (3) Or, \"the discipline of the hunting field and other noble lore.\"\r\n\r\n (4) Lit. \"since that is nature, but the praise of them grew greatly.\"\r\n\r\n (5) According to others, Philyra. Pind. \"Pyth.\" iii. 1, {ethelon\r\n    Kheirona ke Philuridan}; cf. \"Pyth.\" vi. 22; \"Nem.\" iii. 43.\r\n\r\n (6) See Paus. iii. 18. 12.\r\n\r\nThanks to the careful heed they paid to dogs and things pertaining to\r\nthe chase, thanks also to the other training of their boyhood, all these\r\ngreatly excelled, and on the score of virtue were admired.\r\n\r\nIf Cephalus was caught into the arms of one that was a goddess, (7)\r\nAsclepius (8) obtained yet greater honour. To him it was given to raise\r\nthe dead and to heal the sick, whereby, (9) even as a god among mortal\r\nmen, he has obtained to himself imperishable glory. Melanion (10) so far\r\nexcelled in zest for toil that he alone of all that flower of chivalry\r\nwho were his rivals (11) obtained the prize of noblest wedlock with\r\nAtalanta; while as to Nestor, what need to repeat the well-known tale?\r\nso far and wide for many a day has the fame of his virtue penetrated the\r\nears of Hellas. (12)\r\n\r\n (7) Hemera (al. Eos). For the rape of Cephalus see Hes. \"Theog.\" 986;\r\n    Eur. \"Ion,\" 269; Paus. i. 3. 1; iii. 18. 7.\r\n\r\n (8) Lat. Aesculapius.

Pope's rendering:\r\n\r\nTo grace those nuptials from the bright abode Yourselves were present;\r\nwhen this minstrel god (Well pleased to share the feast) amid the quire\r\nStood proud to hymn, and tune his youthful lyre (\"Homer's Il.\" xxiv.)\r\n\r\n    Prof. Robinson Ellis (\"Comment on Catull.\" lxiv.) cites numerous\r\n    passages: Eur. \"I. in T.\" 701 foll., 1036 foll.; Pind. \"Isthm.\" v.\r\n    24; \"Pyth.\" iii. 87-96; Isocr. \"Evag.\" 192. 6; Apoll.

(23)\r\n\r\n (21) For the legend of Meleager see \"Il.\" ix. 524-599, dramatised by\r\n    both Sophocles and Euripides, and in our day by Swinburne,\r\n    \"Atalanta in Calydon.\" Cf. Paus. iii. 8. 9; viii. 54. 4; Ov.\r\n    \"Met.\" viii. 300; Grote, \"H.

Paus. i. 22; Diod. iv. 62.\r\n\r\n (27) Al. \"lived on the lips of men.\" But cf. Eur. \"Hipp.\" 85, {soi kai\r\n    xeneimi kai logois s' ameibomai}. See Frazer, \"Golden Bough,\" i.\r\n    6, for the Hippolytus-Virbius myth.\r\n\r\nPalamedes (28) all his days on earth far outshone those of his own times\r\nin wisdom, and when slain unjustly, won from heaven a vengeance such as\r\nno other mortal man may boast of. (29) Yet died he not at their hands\r\n(30) whom some suppose; else how could the one of them have been\r\naccounted all but best, and the other a compeer of the good? No, not\r\nthey, but base men wrought that deed.\r\n\r\n (28) As to Palamedes, son of Nauplius, his genius and treacherous\r\n    death, see Grote, \"H. G.\" i. 400; \"Mem.\" IV. ii. 33; \"Apol.\" 26;\r\n    Plat. \"Apol.\" 41; \"Rep.\" vii. 522; Eur. fr. \"Palam.\"; Ov. \"Met.\"\r\n    xiii. 56; Paus. x. 31. 1; ii. 20. 3.\r\n\r\n (29) For the vengeance see Schol. ad Eur. \"Orest.\" 422; Philostr.\r\n    \"Her.\" x.

See \"Mem.\" IV. ii. 33; \"Apol.\" 26.\r\n\r\nMenestheus, (31) through diligence and patient care, the outcome of the\r\nchase, so far overshot all men in love of toil that even the chiefs\r\nof Hellas must confess themselves inferior in the concerns of war save\r\nNestor only; and Nestor, it is said, (32) excelled not but alone might\r\nrival him.\r\n\r\n (31) For Menestheus, who led the Athenians against Troy, cf. Hom.\r\n    \"Il.\" ii. 552; iv. 327; Philostr. \"Her.\" ii. 16; Paus. ii. 25. 6;\r\n    i. 17. 6; Plut. \"Thes.\" 32, 35.\r\n\r\n (32) Or, \"so runs the tale,\" e.g. in \"The Catalogue.\" See \"Il.\" ii.\r\n    l.c.: {Nestor oios erizen}, \"Only Nestor rivalled him, for he was\r\n    the elder by birth\" (W. Leaf).\r\n\r\nOdysseus and Diomedes (33) were brilliant for many a single deed of\r\narms, and mainly to these two was due the taking of Troy town. (34)\r\n\r\n (33) The two heroes are frequently coupled in Homer, e.g. \"Il.\" v.\r\n    519; x. 241, etc.\r\n\r\n (34) Or, \"were brilliant in single points, and broadly speaking were\r\n    the cause that Troy was taken.\" See Hygin. \"Fab.\" 108; Virg.\r\n    \"Aen.\" ii. 163.\r\n\r\nCastor and Polydeuces, (35) by reason of their glorious display of arts\r\nobtained from Cheiron, and for the high honour and prestige therefrom\r\nderived, are now immortal.\r\n\r\n (35) Castor, Polydeuces, s. Pollux--the great twin brethren. See\r\n    Grote, \"H. G.\" i. 232 foll.\r\n\r\nMachaon and Podaleirius (36) were trained in this same lore, and proved\r\nthemselves adepts in works of skill, in argument and feats of arms. (37)\r\n\r\n (36) As to the two sons of Asclepius, Machaon and Podaleirius, the\r\n    leaders of the Achaeans, see \"Il.\" ii. 728; Schol. ad Pind.\r\n    \"Pyth.\" iii. 14; Paus. iii. 26; iv. 3; Strab. vi. 4 (284); Diod.\r\n    iv. 71. 4; Grote, \"H.

So much so that if throughout the length and\r\nbreadth of Hellas misfortunes at any time befell city or king, it was\r\nthey who loosed the knot of them; (43) or if all Hellas found herself\r\nconfronted with the hosts of the Barbarians in strife and battle,\r\nonce again it was these who nerved the arms of Hellenes to victory and\r\nrendered Hellas unconquered and unconquerable.\r\n\r\n (43) Reading {eluonto autous}, or if as L. D., {di autous}, transl.\r\n    \"thanks to them, they were loosed.\"\r\n\r\nFor my part, then, my advice to the young is, do not despise hunting or\r\nthe other training of your boyhood, if you desire to grow up to be\r\ngood men, good not only in war but in all else of which the issue is\r\nperfection in thought, word, and deed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe first efforts of a youth emerging from boyhood should be directed to\r\nthe institution of the chase, after which he should come to the rest of\r\neducation, provided he have the means and with an eye to the same; if\r\nhis means be ample, in a style worthy of the profit to be derived; or,\r\nif they be scant, let him at any rate contribute enthusiasm, in nothing\r\nfalling short of the power he possesses.\r\n\r\nWhat are the aids and implements of divers sorts with which he who would\r\nenter on this field must equip himself? These and the theory of each\r\nin particular I will now explain. With a view to success in the\r\nwork, forewarned is forearmed. Nor let such details be looked upon as\r\ninsignificant. Without them there will be an end to practical results.\r\n(1)\r\n\r\n (1) Or, \"The question suggests itself--how many instruments and of\r\n    what sort are required by any one wishing to enter this field? A\r\n    list of these I propose to give, not omitting the theoretical side\r\n    of the matter in each case, so that whoever lays his hand to this\r\n    work may have some knowledge to go upon. It would be a mistake to\r\n    regard these details as trivial. In fact, without them the\r\n    undertaking might as well be let alone.\"\r\n\r\nThe net-keeper should be a man with a real passion for the work, and\r\nin tongue a Hellene, about twenty years of age, of wiry build, agile at\r\nonce and strong, with pluck enough to overcome the toils imposed on him,\r\n(2) and to take pleasure in the work.\r\n\r\n (2) {toutous}, \"by this, that, or the other good quality.\"\r\n\r\nThe ordinary small nets should be made of fine Phasian or Carthaginian\r\n(3) flax, and so too should the road nets and the larger hayes. (4)\r\nThese small nets should be nine-threaded (made of three strandes, and\r\neach strand of three threads), (5) five spans (6) in depth, (7) and two\r\npalms (8) at the nooses or pockets. (9) There should be no knots in\r\nthe cords that run round, which should be so inserted as to run quite\r\nsmoothly. (10) The road net should be twelve-threaded, and the larger\r\nnet (or haye) sixteen. They may be of different sizes, the former\r\nvarying from twelve to twenty-four or thirty feet, the latter from sixty\r\nto one hundred and twenty or one hundred and eighty feet. (11) If larger\r\nthey will be unwieldy and hard to manage. Both should be thirty-knotted,\r\nand the interval of the nooses the same as in the ordinary small nets.\r\nAt the elbow ends (12) the road net should be furnished with nipples\r\n(13) (or eyes), and the larger sort (the haye) with rings, and both\r\nalike with a running line of twisted cord. The pronged stakes (14)\r\nfor the small nets should be ten palms high, (15) as a rule, but there\r\nshould be some shorter ones besides; those of unequal length will be\r\nconvenient to equalise the height on uneven ground, and those of equal\r\nlength on level. They should be sharp-tipped so as to draw out easily\r\n(16) and smooth throughout. Those for the road nets should be twice the\r\nheight, (17) and those for the big (haye) nets five spans long, (18)\r\nwith small forks, the notches not deep; they should be stout and solid,\r\nof a thickness proportionate to their length. The number of props needed\r\nfor the nets will vary--many or few, according to circumstances; a less\r\nnumber if the tension on the net be great, and a larger number when the\r\nnets are slack.

(2) The other breed is literally foxy, being the progeny\r\noriginally of the dog and the fox, whose natures have in the course of\r\nages become blent. (3)\r\n\r\n (1) {Kastoriai}, or Laconian, approaching possibly the harrier type;\r\n    {alopekides}, i.e. vulpocanine, hybrid between fox and dog.\r\n\r\n (2) Or, \"get their appellation from the fact that Castor took delight\r\n    in the business of the chase, and kept this breed specially for\r\n    the purpose.\" Al. {diephulaxen}, \"propagated and preserved the\r\n    breed which we now have.\" See Darwin, \"Animals and Plants under\r\n    Domestication,\" ii. 202, 209.\r\n\r\n (3) Or, \"and through lapse of time the twofold characteristics of\r\n    their progenitors have become blent.\" See Timoth. Gaz. ap.\r\n    Schneid. ad loc. for an ancient superstition as to breeds.\r\n\r\nBoth species present a large proportion of defective animals (4) which\r\nfall short of the type, as being under-sized, or crook-nosed, (5)\r\nor gray-eyed, (6) or near-sighted, or ungainly, or stiff-jointed, or\r\ndeficient in strength, thin-haired, lanky, disproportioned, devoid of\r\npluck or of nose, or unsound of foot. To particularise: an under-sized\r\ndog will, ten to one, break off from the chase (7) faint and flagging\r\nin the performance of his duty owing to mere diminutiveness. An aquiline\r\nnose means no mouth, and consequently an inability to hold the hare\r\nfast. (8) A blinking bluish eye implies defect of vision; (9) just as\r\nwant of shape means ugliness. (10) The stiff-limbed dog will come\r\nhome limping from the hunting-field; (11) just as want of strength and\r\nthinness of coat go hand in hand with incapacity for toil. (12)\r\nThe lanky-legged, unsymmetrical dog, with his shambling gait and\r\nill-compacted frame, ranges heavily; while the spiritless animal will\r\nleave his work to skulk off out of the sun into shade and lie down. Want\r\nof nose means scenting the hare with difficulty, or only once in a way;\r\nand however courageous he may be, a hound with unsound feet cannot stand\r\nthe work, but through foot-soreness will eventually give in. (13)\r\n\r\n (4) Or, \"defective specimens (that is to say, the majority) are to be\r\n    noted, as follows.\"\r\n\r\n (5) {grupai}.\r\n\r\n (6) {kharopoi}. Al.

The toil and\r\n    moil will be too great to endure, and owing to the pains in his\r\n    feet he will in the end give in.\"\r\n\r\nSimilarly many different modes of hunting a line of scent are to be seen\r\nin the same species of hound. (14) One dog as soon as he has found the\r\ntrail will go along without sign or symptom to show that he is on\r\nthe scent; another will vibrate his ears only and keep his tail (15)\r\nperfectly still; while a third has just the opposite propensity: he will\r\nkeep his ears still and wag with the tip of his tail. Others draw their\r\nears together, and assuming a solemn air, (16) drop their tails, tuck\r\nthem between their legs, and scour along the line. Many do nothing of\r\nthe sort. (17) They tear madly about, babbling round the line when they\r\nlight upon it, and senselessly trampling out the scent. Others again\r\nwill make wide circuits and excursions; either forecasting the line,\r\n(18) they overshoot it and leave the hare itself behind, or every time\r\nthey run against the line they fall to conjecture, and when they catch\r\nsight of the quarry are all in a tremor, (19) and will not advance a\r\nstep till they see the creature begin to stir.\r\n\r\n (14) Or, \"Also the same dogs will exhibit many styles of coursing: one\r\n    set as soon as they have got the trail pursue it without a sign,\r\n    so there is no means of finding out that the animal is on the\r\n    track.\"\r\n\r\n (15) \"Stern.\"\r\n\r\n (16) Or \"with their noses solemnly fixed on the ground and sterns\r\n    lowered.\"\r\n\r\n (17) Or, \"have quite a different action\"; \"exhibit quite another\r\n    manner.\"\r\n\r\n (18) i.e. \"they cast forwards to make short cuts,\" of skirters too\r\n    lazy to run the line honestly.\r\n\r\n (19) Reading {tremousi}, \"fall a-trembling\"; al. {atremousi}, stand\r\n    \"stock-still\"; i.e. are \"dwellers.\"\r\n\r\nA particular sort may be described as hounds which, when hunting or\r\npursuing, run forward with a frequent eye to the discoveries of the rest\r\nof the pack, because they have no confidence in themselves. Another sort\r\nis over-confident--not letting the cleverer members of the pack go\r\non ahead, but keeping them back with nonsensical clamour. Others will\r\nwilfully hug every false scent, (20) and with a tremendous display of\r\neagerness, whatever they chance upon, will take the lead, conscious all\r\nthe while they are playing false; (21) whilst another sort again will\r\nbehave in a precisely similar style out of sheer ignorance. (22) It is\r\na poor sort of hound which will not leave a stale line (23) for want of\r\nrecognising the true trail. So, too, a hound that cannot distinguish\r\nthe trail leading to a hare's form, and scampers over that of a running\r\nhare, hot haste, is no thoroughbred. (24)\r\n\r\n (20) Al. \"seem to take pleasure in fondling every lie.\"\r\n\r\n (21) Or, \"fully aware themselves that the whole thing is a make-\r\n    believe.\"\r\n\r\n (22) Or, \"do exactly the same thing because they do not know any\r\n    better.\"\r\n\r\n (23) {ek ton trimmon}. Lit. \"keep away from beaten paths,\" and\r\n    commonly of footpaths, but here apparently of the hare's habitual\r\n    \"run,\" not necessarily lately traversed, still less the true line.\r\n\r\n (24) Lit. \"A dog who on the one hand ignores the form track, and on\r\n    the other tears swiftly over a running track, is not a well-bred\r\n    dog.\" Al. {ta eunaia}, \"traces of the form\"; {ta dromaia}, \"tracks\r\n    of a running hare.\" See Sturz. s.v. {dromaios}.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the actual chase, some hounds will show great ardour\r\nat first starting, but presently give up from weakness of spirit. Others\r\nwill run in too hastily (25) and then balk; and go hopelessly astray, as\r\nif they had lost the sense of hearing altogether.\r\n\r\n (25) So L. & S., {upotheousin} = \"cut in before\" the rest of the pack\r\n    and over-run the scent. Al. \"flash in for a time, and then lose\r\n    the scent.\"\r\n\r\nMany a hound will give up the chase and return from mere distaste for\r\nhunting, (26) and not a few from pure affection for mankind. Others with\r\ntheir clamorous yelping on the line do their best to deceive, as if true\r\nand false were all one to them. (27) There are others that will not do\r\nthat, but which in the middle of their running, (28) should they catch\r\nthe echo of a sound from some other quarter, will leave their own\r\nbusiness and incontinently tear off towards it. (29) The fact is, (30)\r\nthey run on without clear motive, some of them; others taking too much\r\nfor granted; and a third set to suit their whims and fancies. Others\r\nsimply play at hunting; or from pure jealousy, keep questing about\r\nbeside the line, continually rushing along and tumbling over one\r\nanother. (31)\r\n\r\n (26) Or, {misotheron}, \"out of antipathy to the quarry.\" For\r\n    {philanthropon} cf. Pollux, ib. 64; Hermog. ap. L. Dind.\r\n\r\n (27) Or, \"unable apparently to distinguish false from true.\" See\r\n    Sturz, s.v. {poieisthai}. Cf. Plut. \"de Exil.\" 6.

Some follow up the chase\r\n    {asaphos}, indistinctly; some {polu upolambanousai}, with a good\r\n    deal of guess-work; others again {doxazousai}, without conviction,\r\n    insincerely; others, {peplasmenos}, out of mere pretence, pure\r\n    humbug, make-believe, or {phthoneros}, in a fit of jealousy,\r\n    {ekkunousi}, are skirters; al. {ekkinousi}, Sturz, quit the scent.\r\n\r\n (31) Al. \"unceasingly tearing along, around, and about it.\"\r\n\r\nThe majority of these defects are due to natural disposition, though\r\nsome must be assigned no doubt to want of scientific training. In either\r\ncase such hounds are useless, and may well deter the keenest sportsman\r\nfrom the hunting field. (32)\r\n\r\n (32) Or, \"Naturally, dogs like these damp the sportsman's ardour, and\r\n    indeed are enough to sicken him altogether with the chase.\"\r\n\r\nThe characters, bodily and other, exhibited by the finer specimens of\r\nthe same breed, (33) I will now set forth.\r\n\r\n (33) Or, \"The features, points, qualities, whether physical or other,\r\n    which characterise the better individuals.\" But what does Xenophon\r\n    mean by {tou autou genous}?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIn the first place, this true type of hound should be of large build;\r\nand, in the next place, furnished with a light small head, broad and\r\nflat in the snout, (1) well knit and sinewy, the lower part of the\r\nforehead puckered into strong wrinkles; eyes set well up (2) in the\r\nhead, black and bright; forehead large and broad; the depression between\r\nthe eyes pronounced; (3) ears long (4) and thin, without hair on the\r\nunder side; neck long and flexible, freely moving on its pivot; (5)\r\nchest broad and fairly fleshy; shoulder-blades detached a little from\r\nthe shoulders; (6) the shin-bones of the fore-legs should be small,\r\nstraight, round, stout and strong; the elbows straight; ribs (7) not\r\ndeep all along, but sloped away obliquely; the loins muscular, in size\r\na mean between long and short, neither too flexible nor too stiff; (8)\r\nflanks, a mean between large and small; the hips (or \"couples\") rounded,\r\nfleshy behind, not tied together above, but firmly knitted on the\r\ninside; (9) the lower or under part of the belly (10) slack, and the\r\nbelly itself the same, that is, hollow and sunken; tail long, straight,\r\nand pointed; (11) thighs (i.e. hams) stout and compact; shanks (i.e.\r\nlower thighs) long, round, and solid; hind-legs much longer than the\r\nfore-legs, and relatively lean; feet round and cat-like.

(14) Forwards they should go with many a circle towards\r\nthe hare's form, (15) steadily guided by the line, all together. When\r\nthey are close to the hare itself, they will make the fact plain to the\r\nhuntsman by the quickened pace at which they run, as if they would let\r\nhim know by their fury, by the motion of head and eyes, by rapid changes\r\nof gait and gesture, (16) now casting a glance back and now fixing their\r\ngaze steadily forward to the creature's hiding-place, (17) by twistings\r\nand turnings of the body, flinging themselves backwards, forwards, and\r\nsideways, and lastly, by the genuine exaltation of spirits, visible\r\nenough now, and the ecstasy of their pleasure, that they are close upon\r\nthe quarry.\r\n\r\n (13) Lit. \"Let them follow up the trail.\"\r\n\r\n (14) Lit. \"fawning and wagging their tails.\"\r\n\r\n (15) Lit. \"bed\" or \"lair.\"\r\n\r\n (16) Or, \"by rapid shiftings of attitude, by looks now thrown backward\r\n    and now forwards to the...\" Reading {kai apo ton anablemmaton\r\n    kai emblemmaton ton epi tas kathedras tou l.}, or if with L.

Twist for twist and turn for turn,\r\nthey, too, must follow in a succession of swift and brilliant bursts,\r\ninterrupted by frequent doublings; while ever and again they give tongue\r\nand yet again till the very welkin rings. (19) One thing they must not\r\ndo, and that is, leave the scent and return crestfallen to the huntsman.\r\n(20)\r\n\r\n (18) Lit. \"let them follow up the chase vigorously, and not relax,\r\n    with yelp and bark.\"\r\n\r\n (19) {dikaios}, Sturz, \"non temere\"; \"and not without good reason.\"\r\n    Al. \"a right good honest salvo of barks.\"\r\n\r\n (20) Lit. \"Let them not hark back to join the huntsman, and desert the\r\n    trail.\"\r\n\r\nAlong with this build and method of working, hounds should possess four\r\npoints. They should have pluck, sound feet, keen noses, and sleek coats.\r\nThe spirited, plucky hound will prove his mettle by refusing to leave\r\nthe chase, however stifling the weather; a good nose is shown by his\r\ncapacity for scenting the hare on barren and dry ground exposed to the\r\nsun, and that when the orb is at the zenith; (21) soundness of foot in\r\nthe fact that the dog may course over mountains during the same season,\r\nand yet his feet will not be torn to pieces; and a good coat means the\r\npossession of light, thick, soft, and silky hair. (22)\r\n\r\n (21) i.e. \"at mid-day\"; or, \"in the height of summer\"; al. \"during the\r\n    dog-days\"; \"at the rising of the dog-star.\"\r\n\r\n (22) See Pollux, ib. 59; Arrian, vi. 1.\r\n\r\nAs to the colour proper for a hound, (23) it should not be simply tawny,\r\nnor absolutely black or white, which is not a sign of breeding, but\r\nmonotonous--a simplicity suggestive of the wild animal. (24) Accordingly\r\nthe red dog should show a bloom of white hair about the muzzle, and\r\nso should the black, the white commonly showing red. On the top of the\r\nthigh the hair should be straight and thick, as also on the loins and on\r\nthe lower portion of the stern, but of a moderate thickness only on the\r\nupper parts.\r\n\r\n (23) See Stonehenge, p. 25; Darwin, op. cit. ii. 109.\r\n\r\n (24) But see Pollux, ib. 65, who apparently read {gennaion touto to\r\n    aploun alla therides}; al. Arrian, vi. See Jaques de Fouilloux,\r\n    \"La Venerie\" (ap. E. Talbot, \"Oeuvres completes de Xenophon,\"\r\n    traduction, ii. 318).\r\n\r\nThere is a good deal to be said for taking your hounds frequently into\r\nthe mountains; not so much for taking them on to cultivated land. (25)\r\nAnd for this reason: the fells offer facilities for hunting and for\r\nfollowing the quarry without interruption, while cultivated land, owing\r\nto the number of cross roads and beaten paths, presents opportunities\r\nfor neither. Moreover, quite apart from finding a hare, it is an\r\nexcellent thing to take your dogs on to rough ground. It is there they\r\nwill become sound of foot, and in general the benefit to their physique\r\nin working over such ground will amply repay you. (26)\r\n\r\n (25) Or, \"pretty often, and less frequently over.\"\r\n\r\n (26) Lit. \"they must be benefited in their bodies generally by working\r\n    over such ground.\"\r\n\r\nThey should be taken out in summer till mid-day; in winter from sunrise\r\nto sundown; in autumn any time except mid-day; and in spring any time\r\nbefore evening. These times will hit the mean of temperature. (27)\r\n\r\n (27) Or, \"You may count on a moderate temperature at these times.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe tracks of hares are long in winter owing to the length of night, and\r\nshort for the opposite reason during summer. In winter, however, their\r\nscent does not lie in early morning, when the rime is on the ground, or\r\nearth is frozen. (1) The fact is, hoar frost by its own inherent force\r\nabsorbs its heat, whilst black frost freezes it. (2)\r\n\r\n (1) Or, \"when there is hoar frost or black frost\" (lit. \"ice\").\r\n\r\n (2) Or, \"the ice congeals them,\" \"encases as it were in itself the\r\n    heat,\" i.e. the warm scent; aliter, \"causes the tracks to freeze\r\n    at the top.\"\r\n\r\nThe hounds, moreover, with their noses nipped by the cold, (3) cannot\r\nunder these conditions (4) use their sense of smell, until the sun\r\nor the mere advance of day dissolves the scent. Then the noses of the\r\nhounds recover, and the scent of the trail begins to exhale itself\r\nperceptibly. (5)\r\n\r\n (3) Reading {malkiosai}, Cobet, \"N. Lect.\" 131. \"Mnem.\" 3, 306;\r\n    Rutherford, \"N.

Aliter, \"is perceptible to smell as it is wafted\r\n    by the breeze to greet them.\"\r\n\r\nHeavy dews also will obliterate scent by its depressing effect; (6) and\r\nrains occurring after long intervals, while bringing out odours from\r\nthe earth, (7) will render the soil bad for scent until it dries again.\r\nSoutherly winds will not improve scent--being moisture-laden they\r\ndisperse it; whereas northerly winds, provided the scent has not been\r\npreviously destroyed, tend to fix and preserve it. Rains will drown\r\nand wash it away, and so will drizzle; while the moon by her heat\r\n(8)--especially a full moon--will dull its edge; in fact the trail is\r\nrarest--most irregular (9)--at such times, for the hares in their joy\r\nat the light with frolic and gambol (10) literally throw themselves high\r\ninto the air and set long intervals between one footfall and another.\r\nOr again, the trail will become confused and misleading when crossed by\r\nthat of foxes.

(12) In summer scent is thin and indistinct; the earth being\r\nbaked through and through absorbs the thinner warmth inherent in the\r\ntrail, while the dogs themselves are less keen scented at that season\r\nthrough the general relaxation of their bodies. (13) In autumn scent\r\nlies clean, all the products of the soil by that time, if cultivable,\r\nbeing already garnered, or, if wild, withered away with age, so that\r\nthe odours of various fruits are no longer a disturbing cause through\r\nblowing on to the line. (14) In winter, summer, and autumn, moreover,\r\nas opposed to spring, the trail of a hare lies for the most part in\r\nstraight lines, but in the earlier season it is highly complicated, for\r\nthe little creatures are perpetually coupling and particularly at this\r\nseason, so that of necessity as they roam together for the purpose they\r\nmake the line intricate as described.\r\n\r\n (12) i.e. \"with the scent into a composite and confusing whole.\"\r\n\r\n (13) Or, \"owing to the relaxed condition of their frames.\"\r\n\r\n (14) Lit. \"The fruity odours do not, as commingling currents, injure\r\n    the trail.\"\r\n\r\nThe scent of the line leading to the hare's form lies longer than that\r\nof a hare on the run, and for this reason: in proceeding to her form the\r\nhare keeps stopping, (15) the other is in rapid motion; consequently,\r\nthe ground in one case is thickly saturated all along with scent, in the\r\nother sparsely and superficially. So, too, scent lies better in woody\r\nthan on barren ground, since, whilst running to and fro or sitting up,\r\nthe creature comes in contact with a variety of objects. Everything\r\nthat earth produces or bears upon her bosom will serve as puss's\r\nresting-place. These are her screen, her couch, her canopy; (16) apart,\r\nit may be, or close at hand, or at some middle point, among them she\r\nlies ensconced. At times, with an effort taxing all her strength, she\r\nwill spring across to where some jutting point or clinging undergrowth\r\non sea or freshet may attract her.\r\n\r\n (15) \"The form tracks are made by the hare leisurely proceeding and\r\n    stopping at times; those on the run quickly.\"\r\n\r\n (16) Lit. \"Anything and everything will serve to couch under, or\r\n    above, within, beside, now at some distance off, and now hard by,\r\n    and now midway between.\"\r\n\r\nThe couching hare (17) constructs her form for the most part in\r\nsheltered spots during cold weather and in shady thickets during the hot\r\nseason, but in spring and autumn on ground exposed to the sun. Not so\r\nthe running (18) animal, for the simple reason that she is scared out of\r\nher wits by the hounds. (19)\r\n\r\n (17) \"The form-frequenting hare.\"\r\n\r\n (18) \"Her roving congener,\" i.e. the hunted hare that squats. The\r\n    distinction drawn is between the form chosen by the hare for her\r\n    own comfort, and her squatting-place to escape the hounds when\r\n    hunted.\r\n\r\n (19) i.e. \"the dogs have turned her head and made her as mad as a\r\n    March hare.\"\r\n\r\nIn reclining the hare draws up the thighs under the flanks, (20) putting\r\nits fore-legs together, as a rule, and stretching them out, resting\r\nits chin on the tips of its feet. It spreads its ears out over the\r\nshoulder-blades, and so shelters the tender parts of its body; its hair\r\nserves as a protection, (21) being thick and of a downy texture. When\r\nawake it keeps on blinking its eyelids, (22) but when asleep the eyelids\r\nremain wide open and motionless, and the eyes rigidly fixed; during\r\nsleep it moves its nostrils frequently, if awake less often.\r\n\r\n (20) Pollux, v. 72.\r\n\r\n (21) Or, \"as a waterproof.\"\r\n\r\n (22) So Pollux, ib.\r\n\r\nWhen the earth is bursting with new verdure, (23) fields and farm-lands\r\nrather than mountains are their habitat. (24) When tracked by the\r\nhuntsman their habit is everywhere to await approach, except only in\r\ncase of some excessive scare during the night, in which case they will\r\nbe on the move.\r\n\r\n (23) \"When the ground teems with vegetation.\"\r\n\r\n (24) Or, \"they frequent cultivated lands,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThe fecundity of the hare is extraordinary. The female, having produced\r\none litter, is on the point of producing a second when she is already\r\nimpregnated for a third. (25)\r\n\r\n (25) Re hyper-foetation cf. Pollux, v. 73, ap. Schneid.; Herod. iii.\r\n    108; Aristot. \"H. A.\" iv. 5; Erastosthenes, \"Catasterism,\" 34;\r\n    Aelian, \"V. H.\" ii. 12; Plin. \"N. H.\" vii. 55.\r\n\r\nThe scent of the leveret lies stronger (26) than that of the grown\r\nanimal. While the limbs are still soft and supple they trail full length\r\non the ground. Every true sportsman, however, will leave these quite\r\nyoung creatures to roam freely. (27) \"They are for the goddess.\"\r\nFull-grown yearlings will run their first chase very swiftly, (28) but\r\nthey cannot keep up the pace; in spite of agility they lack strength.\r\n\r\n (26) Cf. Pollux, v. 74.\r\n\r\n (27) {aphiasi}, cf. Arrian, xxii. 1, \"let them go free\"; Aesch. \"P.\r\n    V.\" 666; Plat. \"Prot.\" 320 A.\r\n\r\n (28) Or, \"will make the running over the first ring.\"\r\n\r\nTo find the trail you must work the dogs downwards through the\r\ncultivated lands, beginning at the top. Any hares that do not come into\r\nthe tilled districts must be sought in the meadows and the glades; near\r\nrivulets, among the stones, or in woody ground. If the quarry makes off,\r\n(29) there should be no shouting, that the hounds may not grow too eager\r\nand fail to discover the line. When found by the hounds, and the chase\r\nhas begun, the hare will at times cross streams, bend and double and\r\ncreep for shelter into clefts and crannied lurking-places; (30) since\r\nthey have not only the hounds to dread, but eagles also; and, so long as\r\nthey are yearlings, are apt to be carried off in the clutches of these\r\nbirds, in the act of crossing some slope or bare hillside. When they are\r\nbigger they have the hounds after them to hunt them down and make away\r\nwith them. The fleetest-footed would appear to be those of the low\r\nmarsh lands. The vagabond kind (31) addicted to every sort of ground\r\nare difficult to hunt, for they know the short cuts, running chiefly\r\nup steeps or across flats, over inequalities unequally, and downhill\r\nscarcely at all.\r\n\r\n (29) Or, \"shifts her ground.\"\r\n\r\n (30) Or, \"in their terror not of dogs only, but of eagles, since up to\r\n    a year old they are liable to be seized by these birds of prey\r\n    while crossing some bottom or bare ground, while if bigger...\"\r\n\r\n (31) {oi... planetai}, see Ael. op. cit. xiii. 14.\r\n\r\nWhilst being hunted they are most visible in crossing ground that has\r\nbeen turned up by the plough, if, that is, they have any trace of red\r\nabout them, or through stubble, owing to reflection. So, too, they are\r\nvisible enough on beaten paths or roads, presuming these are fairly\r\nlevel, since the bright hue of their coats lights up by contrast. On the\r\nother hand, they are not noticeable when they seek the cover of rocks,\r\nhills, screes, or scrub, owing to similarity of colour. Getting a fair\r\nstart of the hounds, they will stop short, sit up and rise themselves up\r\non their haunches, (32) and listen for any bark or other clamour of the\r\nhounds hard by; and when the sound reaches them, off and away they go.\r\nAt times, too, without hearing, merely fancying or persuading themselves\r\nthat they hear the hounds, they will fall to skipping backwards and\r\nforwards along the same trail, (33) interchanging leaps, and interlacing\r\nlines of scent, (34) and so make off and away.\r\n\r\n (32) Cf. the German \"Mannerchen machen,\" \"play the mannikin.\" Shaks.\r\n    \"V. and A.\" 697 foll.\r\n\r\n (33) Passage imitated by Arrian, xvi. 1.\r\n\r\n (34) Lit. \"imprinting track upon track,\" but it is better perhaps to\r\n    avoid the language of woodcraft at this point.\r\n\r\nThese animals will give the longest run when found upon the open, there\r\nbeing nothing there to screen the view; the shortest run when started\r\nout of thickets, where the very darkness is an obstacle.\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct kinds of hare--the big kind, which is somewhat\r\ndark in colour (35) with a large white patch on the forehead; and the\r\nsmaller kind, which is yellow-brown with only a little white. The tail\r\nof the former kind is variegated in a circle; of the other, white at\r\nthe side. (36) The eyes of the large kind are slightly inclined to gray;\r\n(37) of the smaller, bluish. The black about the tips of the ears is\r\nlargely spread in the one, but slightly in the other species. Of these\r\ntwo species, the smaller is to be met with in most of the islands,\r\ndesert and inhabited alike. As regards numbers they are more abundant in\r\nthe islands than on the mainland; the fact being that in most of these\r\nthere are no foxes to attack and carry off either the grown animal or\r\nits young; nor yet eagles, whose habitat is on lofty mountains rather\r\nthan the lower type of hills which characterise the islands. (38) Again,\r\nsportsmen seldom visit the desert islands, and as to those which\r\nare inhabited, the population is but thinly scattered and the folk\r\nthemselves not addicted to the chase; while in the case of the sacred\r\nislands, (39) the importation of dogs is not allowed. If, then, we\r\nconsider what a small proportion of hares existent at the moment will\r\nbe hunted down and again the steady increase of the stock through\r\nreproduction, the enormous numbers will not be surprising.

To begin with, its eyes\r\nare set too prominently on the skull, and the eyelids are clipped and\r\nblear, (41) and afford no protection to the pupils. (42) Naturally\r\nthe sight is indistinct and purblind. (43) Along with which, although\r\nasleep, for the most part it does not enjoy visual repose. (44) Again,\r\nits very fleetness of foot contributes largely towards dim-sightedness.\r\nIt can only take a rapid glance at things in passing, and then off\r\nbefore perceiving what the particular object is.

If it held on its course uphill, (47) it would\r\nseldom meet with such a fate; but now, through its propensity to circle\r\nround and its attachment to the place where it was born and bred, it\r\ncourts destruction. Owing to its speed it is not often overtaken by\r\nthe hounds by fair hunting.

Witness the conformation of its body: the light, small\r\ndrooping head (narrow in front); (49) the (thin cylindrical) (50) neck,\r\nnot stiff and of a moderate length; straight shoulder-blades, loosely\r\nslung above; the fore-legs attached to them, light and set close\r\ntogether; (51) the undistended chest; (52) the light symmetrical sides;\r\nthe supple, well-rounded loins; the fleshy buttocks; the somewhat sunken\r\nflanks; (53) the hips, well rounded, plump at every part, but with a\r\nproper interval above; the long and solid thighs, on the outside tense\r\nand not too flabby on the inside; the long, stout lower legs or shanks;\r\nthe fore-feet, exceedingly pliant, thin, and straight; the hind-feet\r\nfirm and broad; front and hind alike totally regardless of rough ground;\r\nthe hind-legs far longer than the fore, inclined outwards somewhat; the\r\nfur (54) short and light.\r\n\r\n (49) Reading {katophere  (stenen ek tou emprosthen)}.

If proof of this lightness\r\nand agility be needed, here is a fact in illustration. When proceeding\r\nquietly, its method of progression is by leaps; no one ever saw or is\r\nlikely to see a hare walking. What it does is to place the hind-feet in\r\nfront of the fore-feet and outside them, and so to run, if running one\r\ncan call it. The action prints itself plainly on snow. The tail is not\r\nconducive to swiftness of pace, being ill adapted by its stumpiness to\r\nact as a rudder to direct the body. The animal has to do this by means\r\nof one or other ear; (55) as may be seen, when she is on the point of\r\nbeing caught by the hounds. (56) At that instant you may see her drop\r\nand shoot out aslant one of her ears towards the point of attack, and\r\nthen, apparently throwing her full weight on that pivot, turn sharp\r\nround and in a moment leave her assailants far behind.\r\n\r\n (55) So Ael. \"N.

To meddle with them is\r\nugly and base, not to speak of the bad example of lawlessness set to the\r\nbeholder.

The plan of making collar and leash all in one is a clumsy\r\ncontrivance for keeping a hound in check. (3) The surcingle should be\r\nbroad in the thongs so as not to gall the hound's flanks, and with spurs\r\nstitched on to the leather, to preserve the purity of the breed.

In the absence, however, of any of these hindrances,\r\ntake them out every other day. (6) Do not let your hounds get into the\r\nhabit of hunting foxes. Nothing is so ruinous; and just at the moment\r\nwhen you want them, they will not be forthcoming. On the other hand,\r\nvary the hunting-ground in taking them out; which will give the pack a\r\nwider experience in hunting and their master a better knowledge of the\r\ncountry. The start should be early in the morning, unless the scent is\r\nto fail the hounds entirely. (7) The dilatory sportsman robs the pack of\r\nfinding and himself of profit. (8) Subtle and delicate by nature, scent\r\nwill not last all day.\r\n\r\n (5) \"You cannot trust the hound's nose.\"\r\n\r\n (6) \"Every third day,\" {dia trites tes emeras}.\r\n\r\n (7) Lit. \"in order that they may not be deprived of following up the\r\n    scent.\"\r\n\r\n (8) Or, \"a late start means the hounds will be robbed of a find and\r\n    the huntsman of his reward.\"\r\n\r\nThe net-keeper should wear a light costume. His business is to fix the\r\nnets about the runs, (9) paths, bends, and hollows, and darksome spots,\r\nbrooks, dry torrents, or perennial mountain streams. These are the\r\nplaces to which the hare chiefly betakes itself for refuge; though there\r\nare of course endless others. These, and the side passages into, and\r\nexits from them, whether well marked or ill defined, are to be stopped\r\njust as day breaks; not too early, so that, in case the line of nets be\r\nin the neighbourhood of covert to be searched for game, (10) the\r\nanimal may not be scared at hearing the thud close by. (11) If, on the\r\ncontrary, there should be a wide gap between the two points, there is\r\nless to hinder making the net lines clear and clean quite early, so\r\nthat nothing may cling to them. The keeper must fix the forked props\r\nslantwise, so as to stand the strain when subjected to tension. He must\r\nattach the nooses equally on the points; and see that the props are\r\nregularly fixed, raising the pouch towards the middle; (12) and into the\r\nslip-rope he must insert a large, long stone, to prevent the net from\r\nstretching in the opposite direction, when it has got the hare inside.\r\nHe will fix the rows of poles with stretches of net sufficiently high to\r\nprevent the creature leaping over. (13) In hunting, \"no procrastination\"\r\nshould be the motto, since it is sportsmanlike at once and a proof of\r\nenergy by all means to effect a capture quickly. He will stretch the\r\nlarger (haye) nets upon level spaces; and proceed to plant the road nets\r\nupon roads and at converging points of tracks and footpaths; (14) he\r\nmust attach the border-ropes to the ground, draw together the elbows or\r\nside ends of the nets, fix the forked props between the upper meshes,\r\n(15) adjust the skirting ropes upon the tops, and close up gaps.\r\n\r\n (9) See Pollux, v. 35.\r\n\r\n (10) Al. \"of the game to be hunted up.\"\r\n\r\n (11) {omou}, \"e propinquo.\" Schn. cf. \"Cyrop.\" III. i. 2; VI. iii. 7.\r\n\r\n (12) Or, \"giving the funnel or belly a lift in the middle.\"\r\n    {kekruphalon}, Pollux, v. 31.\r\n\r\n (13) This sentence according to Lenz is out of its place, referring\r\n    solely to the haye nets; the order of the words should be {ta de\r\n    diktua teineto en apedois stoikhizeto de, k.t.l.} If so, transl.\r\n    \"He should stretch the hayes on level ground and fix, etc.; The\r\n    road nets should be planted... etc.\"\r\n\r\n (14) Al. \"at convenient points or where paths converge.\" See Schneid.\r\n    s.v. {sumpheronta}.\r\n\r\n (15) {sardonion}, Pollux, v. 31.

When she is fairly entangled, he is to calm\r\nthe fury of the hounds, without touching them, by soothing, encouraging\r\ntones. He is also to signal to the huntsman with a shout, that the\r\nquarry is taken, or has escaped this side or that, or that he has not\r\nseen it, or where he last caught sight of it. (16)\r\n\r\n (16) Or, \"'caught,' 'escaped,' (this side or that), 'not seen,'\r\n    'marked.'\"\r\n\r\nThe sportsman himself should sally forth in a loose, light hunting\r\ndress, (17) and footgear (18) to match; he should carry a stout stick\r\nin his hand, the net-keeper following. They should proceed to the\r\nhunting-field in silence, to prevent the hare, if by chance there should\r\nbe one close by, from making off at the sound of voices. When they have\r\nreached the covert, he will tie the hounds to trees, each separately, so\r\nthat they can be easily slipped from the leash, and proceed to fix the\r\nnets, funnel and hayes, as above described. When that is done, and while\r\nthe net-keeper mounts guard, the master himself will take the hounds\r\nand sally forth to rouse the game. (19) Then with prayer and promise to\r\nApollo and to Artemis, our Lady of the Chase, (20) to share with them\r\nthe produce of spoil, he lets slip a single hound, the cunningest at\r\nscenting of the pack. (If it be winter, the hour will be sunrise, or if\r\nsummer, before day-dawn, and in the other seasons at some hour midway.)\r\nAs soon as the hound has unravelled the true line (21) he will let slip\r\nanother; and then, if these carry on the line, at rapid intervals he\r\nwill slip the others one by one; and himself follow, without too great\r\nhurry, (22) addressing each of the dogs by name every now and then, but\r\nnot too frequently, for fear of over-exciting them before the proper\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n (17) {emelemenen} = neglige, plain, unpretentious.\r\n\r\n (18) Pollux, v. 18.\r\n\r\n (19) Al. \"intent on the working of the pack.\"\r\n\r\n (20) \"To thee thy share of this chase, Lord Apollo; and thine to thee,\r\n    O Huntress Queen!\"\r\n\r\n (21) Or, \"carries a line straight away from the many that interlace.\"\r\n\r\n (22) Or, \"without forcing the pace.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the hounds are busily at work; onwards they press with eager\r\nspirit, disentangling the line, double or treble, as the case may be.\r\n(23) To and fro they weave a curious web, (24) now across, now parallel\r\nwith the line, (25) whose threads are interlaced, here overlapped, and\r\nhere revolving in a circle; now straight, now crooked; here close, there\r\nrare; at one time clear enough, at another dimly owned.

At last they\r\nhave reached the hare's form, and are in the act to spring upon her.\r\nBut she on a sudden will start up and bring about her ears the barking\r\nclamour of the whole pack as she makes off full speed. Then as the chase\r\ngrows hot, the view halloo! of the huntsman may be heard: \"So ho, good\r\nhounds! that's she! cleverly now, good hounds! so ho, good hounds!\" (26)\r\nAnd so, wrapping his cloak (27) about his left arm, and snatching up his\r\nclub, he joins the hounds in the race after the hare, taking care not to\r\nget in their way, (28) which would stop proceedings. (29) The hare, once\r\noff, is quickly out of sight of her pursuers; but, as a rule, will make\r\na circuit back to the place where she was found.

If not, his business is\r\nto follow up the pack full speed, and not give in, but on through thick\r\nand through thin, for toil is sweet. And if again they chance upon her\r\nin the chevy, (31) his cheery shout will be heard once more, \"Right so!\r\nright so, hounds! forward on, good hounds!\"\r\n\r\n (31) {apantosi diokousai auton}, al. \"come across the huntsman again.\"\r\n\r\nBut if the pack have got too long a start of him, and he cannot overtake\r\nthem, however eagerly he follows up the hunt--perhaps he has altogether\r\nmissed the chase, or even if they are ranging close and giving tongue\r\nand sticking to the scent, he cannot see them--still as he tears along\r\nhe can interrogate the passer-by: \"Hilloa there, have you seen my\r\nhounds?\" he shouts, and having at length ascertained their whereabouts,\r\nif they are on the line, he will post himself close by, and cheer them\r\non, repeating turn and turn about the name of every hound, and pitching\r\nthe tone of his voice sharp or deep, soft or loud; and besides all other\r\nfamiliar calls, if the chase be on a hillside, (32) he can keep up their\r\nspirits with a constant \"Well done, good hounds! well done, good hounds!\r\ngood hounds!\" Or if any are at fault, having overshot the line, he will\r\ncall to them, \"Back, hounds! back, will you! try back!\"\r\n\r\n (32) Or, \"if the chase sweeps over a mountain-side.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the hounds have got back to (where they missed) the line,\r\n(33) he must cast them round, making many a circle to and fro; and where\r\nthe line fails, he should plant a stake (34) as a sign-post to guide\r\nthe eye, and so cast round the dogs from that point, (35) till they have\r\nfound the right scent, with coaxing and encouragement. As soon as the\r\nline of scent is clear, (36) off go the dogs, throwing themselves on to\r\nit, springing from side to side, swarming together, conjecturing, and\r\ngiving signs to one another, and taking bearings (37) they will not\r\nmistake--helter-skelter off they go in pursuit. Once they dart off along\r\nthe line of scent thus hotly, the huntsman should keep up but without\r\nhurrying, or out of zeal they will overshoot the line. As soon as they\r\nare once more in close neighbourhood of the hare, and once again have\r\ngiven their master clear indications of the fact, then let him give\r\nwhat heed he can, she does not move off farther in sheer terror of the\r\nhounds.\r\n\r\n (33) {prosstosi}, al. \"whenever they check.\"\r\n\r\n (34) Al.

(40) Thereupon, whether the hare falls into the toils of the\r\nfunnel net or rushes past outside or inside, whatever incident betide,\r\nthe net-keeper must with a shout proclaim the fact. Should the hare be\r\ncaught, the huntsman has only to begin looking for another; if not, he\r\nmust follow up the chase once more with like encouragement.\r\n\r\n (38) Or, \"whisking their tails and frisking wildly, and jostling\r\n    against one another, and leaping over one another at a great\r\n    rate.\" Al. \"over one obstacle, and then another.\"\r\n\r\n (39) Or, \"this is the true line at last.\"\r\n\r\n (40) Al. \"with a crash of tongues.\"\r\n\r\nWhen at length the hounds show symptoms of fatigue, and it is already\r\nlate in the day, the time has come for the huntsman to look for his hare\r\nthat lies dead-beat; nor must he wittingly leave any patch of green or\r\nclod of earth untested. (41) Backwards and forwards he must try and try\r\nagain the ground, (42) to be sure that nothing has been overlooked. The\r\nfact is, the little creature lies in a small compass, and from fatigue\r\nand fear will not get up. As he leads the hounds on he will cheer and\r\nencourage them, addressing with many a soft term the docile creature,\r\nthe self-willed, stubborn brute more rarely, and to a moderate extent\r\nthe hound of average capacity, till he either succeeds in running down\r\nor driving into the toils some victim. (43) After which he will pick up\r\nhis nets, both small and large alike, giving every hound a rub down, and\r\nreturn home from the hunting-field, taking care, if it should chance to\r\nbe a summer's noon, to halt a bit, so that the feet of his hounds may\r\nnot be blistered on the road.\r\n\r\n (41) Lit. \"anything which earth puts forth or bears upon her bosom.\"\r\n\r\n (42) Or, \"Many and many a cast back must he make.\"\r\n\r\n (43) The famous stanzas in \"Venus and Adonis\" may fitly close this\r\n    chapter.\r\n\r\n     And when thou hast on foot the purblind hare,\r\n     Mark the poor wretch, to overshoot his troubles\r\n     How he outruns the wind and with what care\r\n     He cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles:\r\n        The many musets through the which he goes\r\n        Are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes.\r\n\r\n     Sometimes he runs among a flock of sheep,\r\n     To make the cunning hounds mistake their smell,\r\n     And sometimes where earth-delving conies keep,\r\n     To stop the loud pursuers in their yell,\r\n        And sometimes sorteth with a herd of deer:\r\n        Danger deviseth shifts; wit waits on fear:\r\n\r\n     For there his smell with others being mingled,\r\n     The hot scent-snuffing hounds are driven to doubt,\r\n     Ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled\r\n     With much ado the cold fault cleanly out:\r\n        Then do they spend their mouths: Echo replies,\r\n        As if another chase were in the skies.\r\n\r\n     By this, poor Wat, far off upon a hill,\r\n     Stands on his hinder legs with listening ear,\r\n     To hearken if his foes pursue him still:\r\n     Anon their loud alarums he doth hear;\r\n        And now his grief may be compared well\r\n        To one sore sick that hears the passing-bell.\r\n\r\n     Then shalt thou see the dew-bedabbled wretch\r\n     Turn, and return, indenting with the way;\r\n     Each envious brier his weary legs doth scratch,\r\n     Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:\r\n        For misery is trodden on by many,\r\n        And being low never relieved by any.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nFor breeding purposes choose winter, and release the bitches from hard\r\nwork; (1) which will enable them to profit by repose and to produce a\r\nfine progeny towards spring, since that season is the best to promote\r\nthe growth of the young dogs. The bitch is in heat for fourteen days,\r\n(2) and the moment at which to put her to the male, with a view to rapid\r\nand successful impregnation, is when the heat is passing off. Choose a\r\ngood dog for the purpose. When the bitch is ready to whelp she should\r\nnot be taken out hunting continuously, but at intervals sufficient\r\nto avoid a miscarriage through her over-love of toil. The period of\r\ngestation lasts for sixty days. When littered the puppies should be left\r\nto ther own dam, and not placed under another bitch; foster-nursing does\r\nnot promote growth in the same way, whilst nothing is so good for them\r\nas their own mother's milk and her breath, (3) and the tenderness of her\r\ncaresses.

They should not\r\nbe let loose on the trail of a hare sitting, (10) but should be kept\r\nattached by long leashes and allowed to follow on a line while scenting,\r\n(11) with free scope to run along the trail.

(14) The result of letting slip\r\nyoung hounds, possessed of all the requisite points and full of pluck,\r\n(15) is that the sight of the hare will make them strain too violently\r\nand pull them to bits, (16) while their frames are as yet unknit; a\r\ncatastrophe against which every sportsman should strenuously guard. If,\r\non the other hand, the young hounds do not promise well for running,\r\n(17) there is no harm in letting them go. From the start they will give\r\nup all hope of striking the hare, and consequently escape the injury in\r\nquestion.

(19) When the hare is caught the\r\ncarcass should be given to the young hounds to tear in pieces. (20)\r\n\r\n (19) Perhaps read {eos an thelosi}, \"as long as they choose.\" The MSS.\r\n    have {elthosi}.\r\n\r\n (20) See Stonehenge, p. 287, \"blooded, so as to make him understand\r\n    the nature of the scent\"; ib. 284.\r\n\r\nAs soon as these young hounds refuse to stay close to the nets and begin\r\nto scatter, they must be called back; till they have been accustomed to\r\nfind the hare by following her up; or else, if not taught to quest for\r\nher (time after time) in proper style, they may end by becoming skirters\r\n(21)--a bad education. (22)\r\n\r\n (21) {ekkunoi}, cf. Arrian, xxv. 5.\r\n\r\n (22) {poneron mathema}, ib. 9.\r\n\r\nAs long as they are pups, they should have their food given them\r\nnear the nets, when these are being taken up, (23) so that if from\r\ninexperience they should lose their way on the hunting-field, they may\r\ncome back for it and not be altogether lost. In time they will be quit\r\nof this instinct themselves, (24) when their hostile feeling towards the\r\nanimal is developed, and they will be more concerned about the quarry\r\nthan disposed to give their food a thought. (25)\r\n\r\n (23) {anairontai} sc. {ai arkues}, see above, vi. 26.\r\n\r\n (24) Or, \"abandon the practice.\"\r\n\r\n (25) See Stonehenge, p. 289 (another context): \"... the desire for\r\n    game in a well-bred dog is much greater than the appetite for\r\n    food, unless the stomach has long been deprived of it.\"\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the master should give the dogs their food with his own\r\nhand; since, however much the animal may be in want of food without his\r\nknowing who is to blame for that, it is impossible to have his hunger\r\nsatisfied without his forming an affection for his benefactor. (26)\r\n\r\n (26) Or, \"If want in itself does not reveal to him the cause of his\r\n    suffering, to be given food when hungry for it will arouse in him\r\n    affection for the donor.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nThe time to track hares is after a fall of snow deep enough to conceal\r\nthe ground completely. As long as there are black patches intermixed,\r\nthe hare will be hard to find. It is true that outside these the tracks\r\nwill remain visible for a long time, when the snow comes down with a\r\nnorth wind blowing, because the snow does not melt immediately; but\r\nif the wind be mild with gleams of sunshine, they will not last long,\r\nbecause the snow is quickly thawed. When it snows steadily and without\r\nintermission there is nothing to be done; the tracks will be covered\r\nup. Nor, again, if there be a strong wind blowing, which will whirl and\r\ndrift the snow about and obliterate the tracks. It will not do to take\r\nthe hounds into the field in that case; (1) since owing to excessive\r\nfrost the snow will blister (2) the feet and noses of the dogs and\r\ndestroy the hare's scent. Then is the time for the sportsman to take\r\nthe haye nets and set off with a comrade up to the hills, and leave the\r\ncultivated lands behind; and when he has got upon the tracks to follow\r\nup the clue. If the tracks are much involved, and he follows them only\r\nto find himself back again ere along at the same place, (3) he must make\r\na series of circuits and sweep round the medley of tracks, till he finds\r\nout where they really lead. (4)\r\n\r\n (1) Lit. \"I say it is no use setting out with dogs to this chase.\"\r\n\r\n (2) {kaei}. Cf.

Cf. Ael. \"N. A.\" vi. 47, ap. Schneid. A fact for\r\n    Uncle Remus.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the track is clear, (6) the huntsman will push on a little\r\nfarther; and it will bring him either to some embowered spot (7) or\r\ncraggy bank; since gusts of wind will drift the snow beyond such spots,\r\nwhereby a store of couching-places (8) is reserved (9); and that is what\r\npuss seeks.\r\n\r\n (6) \"Discovered.\"\r\n\r\n (7) \"Thicket or overhanging crag.\"\r\n\r\n (8) {eunasima}, \"places well adapted for a form.\"\r\n\r\n (9) Al. \"many places suited for her form are left aside by puss, but\r\n    this she seeks.\"\r\n\r\nIf the tracks conduct the huntsman to this kind of covert he had better\r\nnot approach too near, for fear the creature should move off. Let him\r\nmake a circuit round; the chances are that she is there; and that will\r\nsoon be clear; for if so, the tracks will not trend outwards from the\r\nplace at any point. (10)\r\n\r\n (10) L. Dind. emend. {oudamoi}, \"the tracks will not pass in any\r\n    direction outwards from such ground.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now when it is clear that puss is there, there let her bide; she\r\nwill not sir; let him set off and seek another, before the tracks are\r\nindistinct; being careful only to note the time of day; so that, in case\r\nhe discovers others, there will be daylight enough for him to set up the\r\nnets. (11) When the final moment has come, he will stretch the big haye\r\nnets round the first one and then the other victim (precisely as in the\r\ncase of one of those black thawed patches above named), so as to enclose\r\nwithin the toils whatever the creature is resting on. (12) As soon as\r\nthe nets are posted, up he must go and start her. If she contrive to\r\nextricate herself from the nets, (13) he must after her, following her\r\ntracks; and presently he will find himself at a second similar piece of\r\nground (unless, as is not improbable, she smothers herself in the snow\r\nbeforehand). (14) Accordingly he must discover where she is and spread\r\nhis toils once more; and, if she has energy still left, pursue the\r\nchase. Even without the nets, caught she will be, from sheer fatigue,\r\n(15) owing to the depth of the snow, which balls itself under her shaggy\r\nfeet and clings to her, a sheer dead weight.\r\n\r\n (11) Al. \"to envelop the victims in the nets.\"\r\n\r\n (12) Lit. \"whatever the creature is in contact with inside.\"\r\n\r\n (13) Cf.

(5) Some one should go beforehand\r\ninto the rank meadowlands (6) and reconnoitre where the hinds are\r\ncongregated, and wherever that may be, the master of the hounds will set\r\noff--with his hounds and a supply of javelins--before daylight to the\r\nplace in question. Here he will attach the hounds to trees (7) some\r\ndistance off, for fear of their barking, (8) when they catch sight of\r\nthe deer. That done he will choose a specular point himself and keep a\r\nsharp look-out. (9) As day breaks he will espy the hinds leading their\r\nfawns to the places where they will lay them severally to rest. (10)\r\nHaving made them lie down and suckled them, they will cast anxious\r\nglances this way and that to see that no one watches them; and then they\r\nwill severally withdraw to the side opposite and mount guard, each over\r\nher own offspring. The huntsman, who has seen it all, (11) will loose\r\nthe dogs, and with javelins in hand himself advance towards the nearest\r\nfawn in the direction of where he saw it laid to rest; carefully noting\r\nthe lie of the land, (12) for fear of making some mistake; since the\r\nplace itself will present a very different aspect on approach from what\r\nit looked like at a distance.\r\n\r\n (4) See above, v. 14.

The fawn will keep perfectly still, glued (13) as it were\r\nto earth, and with loud bleats suffer itself to be picked up; unless it\r\nhappen to be drenched with rain; in which case, it will not stay quiet\r\nin one place. No doubt, the internal moisture of the animal congeals\r\nquickly with the cold (14) and causes it to shift its ground. Caught in\r\nthat case it must needs be; but the hounds will have work enough to run\r\nthe creature down. (15) The huntsman having seized the fawn, will hand\r\nit to the keeper. The bleating will continue; and the hind, partly\r\nseeing and partly hearing, will bear down full tilt upon the man who has\r\ngot her young, in her desire to rescue it.

Those that are already\r\nbig will give more trouble, since they graze with their mothers and\r\nthe other deer, and when pursued retire in the middle of the herd or\r\noccasionally in front, but very seldom in the rear. The deer, moreover,\r\nin order to protect their young will do battle with the hounds and\r\ntrample them under foot; so that capture is not easy, unless you come at\r\nonce to close quarters and scatter the herd, with the result that one or\r\nanother of the fawns is isolated. The effort implies (16) a strain, and\r\nthe hounds will be left behind in the first heat of the race, since the\r\nvery absence of their dams (17) will intensify the young deer's terror,\r\nand the speed of a fawn, that age and size, is quite incredible. (18)\r\nBut at the second or third run they will be quickly captured; since\r\ntheir bodies being young and still unformed cannot hold out long against\r\nfatigue.\r\n\r\n (16) Lit. \"after that violent effort.\"\r\n\r\n (17) Or, \"alarm at the absence of the herd will lend the creature\r\n    wings.\"\r\n\r\n (18) Or, \"is past compare\"; \"is beyond all telling.\"\r\n\r\nFoot-gins (19) or caltrops may be set for deer on mountains, in the\r\nneighbourhood of meadows and streams and wooded glens, on cross-roads\r\n(20) or in tilled fields at spots which they frequent.

Which done, place on the crown\r\nsome rods of spindle-tree, (29) but not so as to stick out beyond the\r\nouter rim; and above these again light leaves, such as the season may\r\nprovide. After this put a final coating of earth upon the leaves; in the\r\nfirst place the surface soil from the holes just dug, and atop of that\r\nsome unbroken solid earth from a distance, so that the lie of the trap\r\nmay be as much as possible unnoticed by the deer. Any earth left over\r\nshould be carried to a distance from the gin.

Those set on cultivated land must always\r\nbe inspected early, before the sun is up in fact, (31) and for this\r\nreason: on the hills, so desert is the region, (32) the creatures may\r\nbe caught not only at night but at any time of day; while, on the\r\ncultivated lands, owing to their chronic apprehension of mankind in\r\ndaytime, night is the only time. (33)\r\n\r\n (31) \"Before the sun is up.\"\r\n\r\n (32) Or, \"thanks to the lonesomeness of the region.\"\r\n\r\n (33) \"It is night or never, owing to the dread of man which haunts the\r\n    creature's mind during daytime.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the huntsman finds a gin uprooted he will let slip his hounds\r\nand with cheery encouragement (34) follow along the wake of the wooden\r\nclog, with a keen eye to the direction of its march. That for the most\r\npart will be plain enough, since stones will be displaced, and the\r\nfurrow which the clog makes as it trails along will be conspicuous on\r\ntilled ground; or if the deer should strike across rough ground, the\r\nrocks will show pieces of bark torn from the clog, and the chase will\r\nconsequently be all the easier. (35)\r\n\r\n (34) See vi. 20; \"with view-halloo.\"\r\n\r\n (35) Or, \"along that track will not be difficult.\"\r\n\r\nShould the deer have been caught by one of its fore-feet it will soon\r\nbe taken, because in the act of running it will beat and batter its own\r\nface and body; if by the hind-leg, the clog comes trailing along and\r\nmust needs impede the action of every limb. Sometimes, too, as it is\r\nwhirled along it will come in contact with the forked branches of some\r\ntree, and then unless the animal can snap the rope in twain, she is\r\nfairly caught; there ends the chase. But even so, if caught in this way\r\nor overdone with fatigue, it were well not to come too close the quarry,\r\nshould it chance to be a stag, or he will lunge out with his antlers and\r\nhis feet; better therefore let fly your javelins from a distance.\r\n\r\nThese animals may also be captured without aid of gin or caltrop, by\r\nsheer coursing in hot summer time; they get so tired, they will stand\r\nstill to be shot down. If hard pressed they will plunge into the sea or\r\ntake to water of any sort in their perplexity, and at times will drop\r\ndown from sheer want of breath. (36)\r\n\r\n (36) \"From mere shortness of breath.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nTo cope with the wild boar the huntsman needs to have a variety of dogs,\r\nIndian, Cretan, Locrian, and Laconian, (1) along with a stock of nets,\r\njavelins, boar-spears, and foot-traps.\r\n\r\n (1) For these breeds see Pollux, v. 37: for the Laconian, Pind. \"Fr.\"\r\n    73; Soph. \"Aj.\" 8; cf. Shakesp. \"Mids. N.

They should be forty-five threaded in three strands,\r\neach strand consisting of fifteen threads. The height from the upper rim\r\n(4) (i.e. from top to bottom) should be ten meshes, and the depth of the\r\nnooses or pockets one elbow-length (say fifteen inches). (5) The ropes\r\nrunning round the net should be half as thick again as the cords of the\r\nnet; and at the extremities (6) they should be fitted with rings, and\r\nshould be inserted (in and out) under the nooses, with the end passing\r\nout through the rings. Fifteen nets will be sufficient. (7)\r\n\r\n (3) i.e. \"of Phasian or Cathaginian fine flax.\"\r\n\r\n (4) {tou koruphaiou}.\r\n\r\n (5) {pugon}.

Schneid.\r\n\r\nThe boar-spears should in the first place have blades fifteen inches\r\nlong, and in the middle of the socket two solid projecting teeth of\r\nwrought metal, (9) and shafts of cornel-wood a spear-shaft's thickness.\r\n\r\n (9) Wrought of copper (or bronze).\r\n\r\nThe foot-traps should resemble those used for deer.\r\n\r\nThese hunts should be conducted not singly, (10) but in parties, since\r\nthe wild boar can be captured only by the collective energy of several\r\nmen, and that not easily.\r\n\r\n (10) Lit. \"There should be a band of huntsmen\"; or, \"It will take the\r\n    united energies of several to capture this game.\" See Hom. \"Il.\"\r\n    ix. 543, of the Calydonian boar:\r\n\r\n{ton d' uios Oineos apekteinen Meleagros, polleon ek polion theretoras\r\nandras ageiras kai kunas. ou men gar k' edame pauroisi brotoisin tossos\r\neen, pollous de pures epebes' alegeines.}\r\n\r\n    \"But him slew Meleagros the son of Oineus, having gathered\r\n    together from many cities huntsmen and hounds; for not of few men\r\n    could the boar be slain, so mighty was he; and many an one brought\r\n    he to the grievous pyre\" (W. Leaf).\r\n\r\nI will now explain how each part of the gear is to be used in hunting.\r\n\r\nThe company being come to some place where a boar is thought to lie, the\r\nfirst step is to bring up the pack, (11) which done, they will loose a\r\nsingle Laconian bitch, and keeping the rest in leash, beat about with\r\nthis one hound. (12) As soon as she has got on the boar's track, let\r\nthem follow in order, one after another, close on the tracking hound,\r\nwho gives the lead to the whole company. (13) Even to the huntsmen\r\nthemselves many a mark of the creature will be plain, such as his\r\nfootprints on soft portions of the ground, and in the thick undergrowth\r\nof forests broken twigs; and, where there are single trees, the scars\r\nmade by his tusks. (14) As she follows up the trail the hound will, as\r\na general rule, finally arrive at some well-wooded spot; since, as a\r\ngeneral rule, the boar lies ensconced in places of the sort, that are\r\nwarm in winter and cool in summer.\r\n\r\n (11) {kunegesion}, \"a hunting establishment, huntsmen and hounds, a\r\n    pack of hounds,\" L. & S. cf.

The huntsman will\r\nthereupon recover the hound, and tie her up also with the rest at a good\r\ndistance from the lair. (15) He will then launch his toils into the wild\r\nboar's harbourage, (16) placing the nooses upon any forked branches\r\nof wood to hand. Out of the net itself he must construct a deep\r\nforward-jutting gulf or bosom, posting young shoots on this side and\r\nthat within, as stays or beams, (17) so that the rays of light may\r\npenetrate as freely as possible through the nooses into the bosom, (18)\r\nand the interior be as fully lit up as possible when the creature makes\r\nhis charge. The string round the top of the net must be attached to\r\nsome stout tree, and not to any mere shrub or thorn-bush, since these\r\nlight-bending branches will give way to strain on open ground.

Some one man, the most practised hand, will\r\ncheer on the hounds, and the rest will follow in good order at some\r\nconsiderable distance from one another, so as to leave the animal a free\r\npassage; since if he falls into the thick of them as he makes off, there\r\nis a fair chance of being wounded, for he will certainly vent his fury\r\non the first creature he falls foul of.\r\n\r\n (22) Lit. \"then they will take their javelins and boar-spears and\r\n    advance.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the hounds are near his lair, they will make their onslaught.\r\nThe boar, bewildered by the uproar, will rise up and toss the first\r\nhound that ventures to attack him in front. He will then run and fall\r\ninto the toils; or if not, then after him full cry. (23) Even if the\r\nground on which the toils environ him be sloping, he will recover\r\nhimself promptly; (24) but if level, he will at once plant himself firm\r\nas a rock, as if deliberating with himself. (25) At that conjuncture\r\nthe hounds will press hard upon him, while their masters had best keep\r\na narrow eye upon the boar and let fly their javelins and a pelt of\r\nstones, being planted in a ring behind him and a good way off, until the\r\ninstant when with a forward heave of his body he stretches the net tight\r\nand strains the skirting-rope. Thereupon he who is most skilful of\r\nthe company and of the stoutest nerve will advance from the front and\r\ndeliver a home thrust with his hunting-spear.\r\n\r\n (23) Or, \"a pretty chase must follow.\"\r\n\r\n (24) Or, \"if within the prison of the net the ground be sloping, it\r\n    will not take long to make him spring up; he will be up again on\r\n    his legs in no time.\"\r\n\r\n (25) Or, \"being concerned about himself.\"\r\n\r\nShould the animal for all that rain of javelins and stones refuse to\r\nstretch the skirting-rope, should he rather relax (26) in that direction\r\nand make a right-about-face turn bearing down on his assailant, there\r\nis nothing for it, under these circumstances, but to seize a boar-spear,\r\nand advance; firmly clutching it with the left hand forward and with\r\nthe right behind; the left is to steady it, and the right to give it\r\nimpulse; and so the feet, (27) the left advanced in correspondence with\r\nthe left arm, and right with right. As he advances, he will make a lunge\r\nforward with the boar-spear, (27) planting his legs apart not much wider\r\nthan in wrestling, (28) and keeping his left side turned towards his\r\nleft hand; and then, with his eye fixed steadily on the beast's eye, he\r\nwill note every turn and movement of the creature's head. As he brings\r\ndown the boar-spear to the thrust, he must take good heed the animal\r\ndoes not knock it out of his hands by a side movement of the head; (29)\r\nfor if so he will follow up the impetus of that rude knock. In case\r\nof that misfortune, the huntsman must throw himself upon his face and\r\nclutch tight hold of the brushwood under him, since if the wild boar\r\nshould attack him in that posture, owing to the upward curve of its\r\ntusks, it cannot get under him; (30) whereas if caught erect, he must be\r\nwounded. What will happen then is, that the beast will try to raise him\r\nup, and failing that will stand upon and trample him.\r\n\r\n (26) {epanieis}.

Lang).\r\n\r\nFrom this extremity there is but one means of escape, and one alone,\r\nfor the luckless prisoner. One of his fellow-huntsmen must approach with\r\nboar-spear and provoke the boar, making as though he would let fly at\r\nhim; but let fly he must not, for fear of hitting the man under him. The\r\nboar, on seeing this, will leave the fallen man, and in rage and fury\r\nturn to grapple his assailant. The other will seize the instant to\r\nspring to his feet, and not forget to clutch his boar-spear as he\r\nrises to his legs again; since rescue cannot be nobly purchased save\r\nby victory.

If it should be a sow that\r\nfalls into the toils, the huntsman should run up and prod her, taking\r\ncare not to be pushed off his legs and fall, in which case he cannot\r\nescape being trampled on and bitten. Ergo, he will not voluntarily get\r\nunder those feet; but if involuntarily he should come to such a pass,\r\nthe same means (38) of helping each the other to get up again will\r\nserve, as in the case of the male animal; and when he has regained his\r\nlegs, he must ply the boar-spear vigorously till she too has died the\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n (38) {dianastaseis}, \"the same methods of mutual recovery.\"\r\n\r\nWild pigs may be captured further in the following fashion: The nets\r\nare fixed for them at the entrances of woody glens, (39) in coppices and\r\nhollows, and on screes, where there are outlets into rank meadow-lands,\r\nmarshes, and clear pools. (40) The appointed person mounts guard at the\r\nnets with his boar-spear, while the others work the dogs, exploring\r\nthe best and likeliest spots. As soon as the quarry is found the chase\r\ncommences. If then an animal falls into the net, the net-keeper will\r\ngrip his boar-spear and (41) advance, when he will ply it as I have\r\ndescribed; if he escape the net, then after him full cry. In hot, sultry\r\nweather the boar may be run down by the hounds and captured. Though a\r\nmonster in strength, the creature becomes short of breath and will give\r\nin from sheer exhaustion.\r\n\r\n (39) Al. \"at the passages from woodland lakes into oak-coppices.\"\r\n\r\n (40) {udata}, \"waters,\" lakes, pools, rivers, etc.\r\n\r\n (41) Or, \"and proceed to tackle him.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a form of sport which costs the lives of many hounds and endangers\r\nthose of the huntsmen themselves. Supposing that the animal has given in\r\nfrom exhaustion at some moment in the chase, and they are forced to come\r\nto close quarters; (42) whether he has taken to the water, or stands at\r\nbay against some craggy bank, or does not choose to come out from some\r\nthicket (since neither net nor anything else hinders him from bearing\r\ndown like a tornado on whoever approaches); still, even so, advance they\r\nmust, come what come may, to the attack. And now for a display of that\r\nhardihood which first induced them to indulge a passion not fit for\r\ncarpet knights (43)--in other words, they must ply their boar-spears and\r\nassume that poise of body (44) already described, since if one must meet\r\nmisfortune, let it not be for want of observing the best rules. (45)\r\n\r\n (42) Reading {prosienai}  ({ta probolia}).  (The last two words are\r\n    probably a gloss, and should be omitted, since {prosienai} (from\r\n    {prosiemi}) {ta probolia} = \"ply,\" or \"apply their boar-spears,\"\r\n    is hardly Greek.) See Schneid. \"Add. et Corr.\" and L.

(46) The young are not left alone, as long as they are small; and\r\nwhen the hounds have hit upon them or they get wind of something wrong,\r\nthey will disappear like magic, vanishing into the forest. As a rule,\r\nboth parents attend on their own progeny, and are not pleasant then to\r\nmeddle with, being more disposed to do battle for their young than for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n (46) Lit. \"the piglings will resent it (sc. {to aliskesthai})\r\n    strongly\"; al. \"the adult (sub. {to therion}) will stand anything\r\n    rather.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nLions, leopards, lynxes, panthers, bears and all other such game are to\r\nbe captured in foreign countries--about Mount Pangaeus and Cittus beyond\r\nMacedonia; (1) or again, in Nysa beyond Syria, and upon other mountains\r\nsuited to the breeding of large game.\r\n\r\n (1) Of these places, Mt. Pangaeus (mod. Pirnari) (see \"Hell.\" V. ii.\r\n    17), Cittus (s. Cissus, mod. Khortiatzi), N. W. of the Chalcidice,\r\n    Mysian Olympus, and Pindus are well known. Nysa has not been\r\n    verified hitherto, I think. Sturz cf. Bochart, \"Hieroz.\" Part I.\r\n    lib. iii. c. 1, p. 722. Strabo, 637 (xv. 1. 7), mentions a Mount\r\n    Nysa in India sacred to Dionysus, and cites Soph. \"Frag.\" 782--\r\n\r\n{othen kateidon ton bebakkhiomenen brotoisi kleinon Nusan... k.t.l.},\r\n\r\n    but it is a far cry from Xenophon's Syria to India. Possibly it is\r\n    to be sought for in the region of Mt. Amanus.\r\n\r\nIn the mountains, owing to the difficulty of the ground, (2) some of\r\nthese animals are captured by means of poison--the drug aconite--which\r\nthe hunters throw down for them, (3) taking care to mix it with the\r\nfavourite food of the wild best, near pools and drinking-places or\r\nwherever else they are likely to pay visits. Others of them, as they\r\ndescend into the plains at night, may be cut off by parties mounted\r\nupon horseback and well armed, and so captured, but not without causing\r\nconsiderable danger to their captors. (4)\r\n\r\n (2) Or, \"the inaccessibility of their habitats.\"\r\n\r\n (3) \"The method is for the trapper to throw it down mixed with the\r\n    food which the particular creature likes best.\"\r\n\r\n (4) For the poison method see Pollux, v. 82; Plin. \"H. N.\" viii. 27.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the custom is to construct large circular pits of some\r\ndepth, leaving a single pillar of earth in the centre, on the top of\r\nwhich at nightfall they set a goat fast-bound, and hedge the pit about\r\nwith timber, so as to prevent the wild beasts seeing over, and without a\r\nportal of admission. What happens then is this: the wild beasts, hearing\r\nthe bleating in the night, keep scampering round the barrier, and\r\nfinding no passage, leap over it, and are caught. (5)\r\n\r\n (5) See \"Tales from the Fjeld,\" Sir George W. Dasent, \"Father Bruin in\r\n    the Corner.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nWith regard to methods of procedure in the hunting-field, enough has\r\nbeen said. (1) But there are many benefits which the enthusiastic\r\nsportsman may expect to derive from this pursuit. (2) I speak of the\r\nhealth which will thereby accrue to the physical frame, the quickening\r\nof the eye and ear, the defiance of old age, and last, but not least,\r\nthe warlike training which it ensures. To begin with, when some day he\r\nhas to tramp along rough ways under arms, the heavy infantry soldier\r\nwill not faint or flag--he will stand the toil from being long\r\naccustomed to the same experiences in capturing wild beasts. In the next\r\nplace, men so trained will be capable of sleeping on hard couches,\r\nand prove brave guardians of the posts assigned them. In the actual\r\nencounter with the enemy, they will know at once how to attack and to\r\ncarry out the word of command as it passes along the lines, because it\r\nwas just so in the old hunting days that they captured the wild game. If\r\nposted in the van of battle, they will not desert their ranks, because\r\nendurance is engrained in them. In the rout of the enemy their footsteps\r\nwill not falter nor fail: straight as an arrow they will follow the\r\nflying foe, on every kind of ground, through long habituation. (3) Or\r\nif their own army encounter a reverse on wooded and precipitous ground\r\nbeset with difficulties, these will be the men to save themselves with\r\nhonour and to extricate their friends; since long acquaintance with the\r\nbusiness of the chase has widened their intelligence. (4)\r\n\r\n (1) Or, \"Respecting the methods employed in different forms of the\r\n    chase, I have said my say.\" As to the genuineness of this and the\r\n    following chapter see L. Dind. ad loc.; K. Lincke, \"Xenophon's\r\n    Dialog.\" {peri oikonomias}, p. 132.\r\n\r\n (2) Lit. \"this work\"; and in reference to the highly Xenophontine\r\n    argument which follows see \"Hellenica Essays,\" p. 342; cf.\r\n    \"Cyrop.\" I. vi. 28, 39-41.\r\n\r\n (3) \"For the sake of 'auld lang syne.'\"\r\n\r\n (4) Or, \"will place them on the vantage-ground of experts.\"\r\n\r\nNay, even under the worst of circumstances, when a whole mob of\r\nfellow-combatants (5) has been put to flight, how often ere now has\r\na handful (6) of such men, by virtue of their bodily health (7) and\r\ncourage, caught the victorious enemy roaming blindly in some intricacy\r\nof ground, renewed the fight, and routed him. Since so it must ever be;\r\nto those whose souls and bodies are in happy case success is near at\r\nhand.

D.); or\r\n    if {tou eutukhesai}, (vulg.) \"those whose health of soul and body\r\n    is established are ipso facto nigh unto good fortune.\"\r\n\r\nIt was through knowledge that they owed success against their foes to\r\nsuch a training, that our own forefathers paid so careful a heed to\r\nthe young. (9) Though they had but a scant supply of fruits, it was an\r\nimmemorial custom \"not to hinder (10) the hunter from hunting any of\r\nearth's offspring\"; and in addition, \"not to hunt by night (11) within\r\nmany furlongs of the city,\" in order that the adepts in that art might\r\nnot rob the young lads of their game. They saw plainly that among the\r\nmany pleasures to which youth is prone, this one alone is productive of\r\nthe greatest blessings. In other words, it tends to make them sound of\r\nsoul and upright, being trained in the real world of actual things (12)\r\n(and, as was said before, our ancestors could not but perceive they owed\r\ntheir success in war to such instrumentality (13)); and the chase alone\r\ndeprives them of none of the other fair and noble pursuits that they may\r\nchoose to cultivate, as do those other evil pleasures, which ought never\r\nto be learned. Of such stuff are good soldiers and good generals made.\r\n(14) Naturally, those from whose souls and bodies the sweat of toil\r\nhas washed all base and wanton thoughts, who have implanted in them a\r\npassion for manly virtue--these, I say, are the true nobles. (15) Not\r\ntheirs will it be to allow their city or its sacred soil to suffer\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\n (9) Al. \"looked upon the chase as a pursuit incumbent on the young.\"\r\n\r\n (10) {me koluein  (dia) to meden ton epi te ge phuomenon agreuein}. The\r\n    commentators generally omit {dia}, in which case translate as in\r\n    text. Lenz reads {un koluein dia meden} (see his note ad v. 34),\r\n    and translates (p. 61), \"Dass man die Jager nicht hindern solle,\r\n    in allem was die Erde hervorbrachte zu jagen,\" \"not to hinder the\r\n    huntsmen from ranging over any of the crops which spring from\r\n    earth\"; (but if so, we should expect {dia medenos}). Sturz, s.v.\r\n    {agreuein}, notes \"festive,\" \"because the hunter does not hunt\r\n    vegetable products.\" So Gail, \"parce que le chasseur rien veut pas\r\n    aux productions de la terre.\"\r\n\r\n (11) Or, \"set their face against night-hunting,\" cf. \"Mem.\" IV. vii.\r\n    4; Plat. \"Soph.\" 220 D; \"Stranger: There is one mode of striking\r\n    which is done at night, and by the light of a fire, and is called\r\n    by the hunters themselves firing, or spearing by firelight\"\r\n    (Jowett); for which see Scott, \"Guy Mannering,\" ch. x. It seems\r\n    \"night hunting was not to be practised within a certain\r\n    considerable radius, whereby the proficients in that art might\r\n    deprive it (lit. in order that they might not deprive) them (the\r\n    young huntsmen) of their game.\"\r\n\r\n (12) Lit. \"in truth and reality (not among visionary phantoms).\"\r\n\r\n (13) These words are commonly regarded as an addition; and what does\r\n    {te} signify?\r\n\r\n (14) Or, \"Here you have the making of brave soldiers and generals.\r\n    Here in embryo are to be found your future soldiers and generals\r\n    worthy the name.\"\r\n\r\n (15) {outoi aristoi}: these are prima virorum, the true aristocrats.\r\n\r\nSome people tell us it is not right to indulge a taste for hunting,\r\nlest it lead to neglect of home concerns, not knowing that those who are\r\nbenefactors of their country and their friends are in proportion all the\r\nmore devoted to domestic duties. If lovers of the chase pre-eminently\r\nfit themselves to be useful to the fatherland, that is as much as to say\r\nthey will not squander their private means; since with the state itself\r\nthe domestic fortunes of each are saved or lost. The real fact is, these\r\nmen are saviours, not of their own fortunes only, but of the private\r\nfortunes of the rest, of yours and mine. Yet there are not a few\r\nirrational people amongst these cavillers who, out of jealousy, would\r\nrather perish, thanks to their own baseness, than owe their lives to the\r\nvirtue of their neighbours. So true is it that the mass of pleasures are\r\nbut evil, (16) to which men succumb, and thereby are incited to adopt\r\nthe worse cause in speech and course in action. (17) And with what\r\nresult?--from vain and empty arguments they contract emnities, and reap\r\nthe fruit of evil deeds, diseases, losses, death--to the undoing of\r\nthemselves, their children, and their friends. (18) Having their senses\r\ndulled to things evil, while more than commonly alive to pleasures, how\r\nshall these be turned to good account for the salvation of the state?\r\nYet from these evils every one will easily hold aloof, if once enamoured\r\nof those joys whose brief I hold, since a chivalrous education teaches\r\nobedience to laws, and renders justice familiar to tongue and ear. (19)\r\n\r\n (16) See \"Hellenica Essays,\" p. 371.\r\n\r\n (17) \"To depravity of speech and conduct\" (whether as advocates or\r\n    performers). See Aristoph. \"Clouds.\"\r\n\r\n (18) Or, \"bring down on themselves, their children, and their friends\r\n    a spring of misfortunes in the shape of diseases, losses, or even\r\n    death.\"\r\n\r\n (19) \"For what does a chivalrous education teach save to obey the law,\r\n    and to make the theme of justice familiar to tongue and ear?\"\r\n\r\nIn the one camp are those who, subjecting themselves ever to new toil\r\nand fresh instruction, have, at the cost of lessons and exercises\r\npainful to themselves, obtained to their several states salvation;\r\nand in the other are those who for the very irksomeness of the process\r\nchoose not to be taught, but rather to pass away their days in pleasures\r\nunseasonable--nature's abjects these. (20) Not theirs is it to obey\r\neither laws or good instruction; (21) nay, how should they, who never\r\ntoil, discover what a good man ought to be?--in other words, wisdom and\r\njustice are alike beyond their power. Subject to indiscipline, they have\r\nmany a fault to find with him who is well educated.\r\n\r\n (20) Lit. \"the sorriest of mankind these by nature.\"\r\n\r\n (21) Or, \"virtuous argument\"; {logois agathois}, lit. \"good words.\"\r\n\r\nThrough the instrumentality of such as these nothing can go well;\r\nwhereas every blessing which mankind enjoys has been discovered by the\r\nefforts of the nobler sort. Nobler, I say, are those who choose to toil.\r\n(22)\r\n\r\n (22) Or, \"of choice spirits; and who are the choice spirits?--Clearly\r\n    those who choose to toil.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this has been proved conclusively by a notable example. If we look\r\nback to the men of old who sat at the feet of Cheiron--whose names I\r\nmentioned--we see that it was by dedicating the years of their youth to\r\nthe chase (23) that they learnt all their noble lore; and therefrom they\r\nattained to great renown, and are admired even to this day for their\r\nvirtue--virtue who numbers all men as her lovers, as is very plain. Only\r\nbecause of the pains it costs to win her the greater number fall away;\r\nfor the achievement of her is hid in obscurity; while the pains that\r\ncleave to her are manifest. Perchance, if only she were endowed with a\r\nvisible bodily frame, men would less have neglected her, knowing that\r\neven as she is visible to them, so they also are not hid from her eyes.\r\nFor is it not so that when a man moves in the presence of him whom he\r\ndearly loves, (24) he rises to a height above himself, being incapable\r\nof aught base or foul in word or deed in sight of him? (25) But fondly\r\ndreaming that the eye of virtue is closed to them, they are guilty of\r\nmany a base thing and foul before her very face, who is hidden\r\nfrom their eyes. Yet she is present everywhere, being dowered with\r\nimmortality; and those who are perfect in goodness (26) she honours, but\r\nthe wicked she thrusts aside from honour. If only men could know that\r\nshe regards them, how eagerly would they rush to the embrace of toilful\r\ntraining and tribulation, (27) by which alone she is hardly taken; and\r\nso should they gain the mastery over her, and she should be laid captive\r\nat their feet.\r\n\r\n (23) Or, \"that they made their first essay in hunting when mere boys,\r\n    and from hunting upwards were taught many noble arts.\"\r\n\r\n (24) Lit. \"is beheld by his beloved.\" Cf. \"Symp.\" iv. 4; viii. 31.\r\n\r\n (25) Lit. \"in order not to be seen of him.\"\r\n\r\n (26) Lit. \"good with respect to her.\"\r\n\r\n (27) Or, \"to those toils and that training.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nNow what astonishes me in the \"sophists,\" as they are called, (1) is,\r\nthat though they profess, the greater part of them, to lead the young to\r\nvirtue, they really lead them in the opposite direction. Never have we\r\nset eyes on the man anywhere who owed his goodness to the sophists of\r\nto-day. (2) Nor do their writings contain anything (3) calculated to\r\nmake men good, but they have written volumes on vain and frivolous\r\nsubjects, in which the young may find pleasures that pall, but the\r\nessence of virtue is not in them. The result of this literature is to\r\ninflict unnecessary waste of time on those who look to learn something\r\nfrom it all and look in vain, cutting them off from wholesome\r\noccupations and even teaching what is bad. I cannot then but blame them\r\nfor certain large offences (4) more than lightly; but as regards the\r\nsubject matter of their writings my charge is, that while full of\r\nfar-fetched phraseology, (5) of solid wholesome sentiments, by which\r\nthe young might be trained to virtue, I see not a vestige. Speaking as a\r\nplain man, I know that to be taught what is good by one's own nature is\r\nbest of all, (6) and next best to learn of those who really do know some\r\ngood thing rather than of those who have an art to deceive. It may\r\nwell be that I fail to express myself in subtle language, (7) nor do\r\nI pretend to aim at subtlety; what I do aim at is to express\r\nrightly-conceived thoughts such as may serve the need of those who have\r\nbeen nobly disciplined in virtue; for it is not words and names that\r\ngive instruction, but thoughts and sentiments worthy the name.\r\n\r\n (1) Cf. Isocr. \"Against the Sophists\"; \"Antidosis\"; \"Hel. Encom.\";\r\n    Plat. \"Sophist.\"\r\n\r\n (2) Who are these {oi nun sophistai}?\r\n\r\n (3) Lit. \"do they present writings to the world.\"\r\n\r\n (4) Or, \"as to certain weightier matters gravely.\"\r\n\r\n (5) {remata} = \"words and phrases\"; {ynomai} = \"moral maxims, just\r\n    thoughts.\"\r\n\r\n (6) \"Being myself but a private individual and a plain man.\" According\r\n    to Hartman, \"A.

(8)\r\nCertainly it does not escape my notice that an orderly sequence of ideas\r\nadds beauty to the composition: (9) I mean it will be easy to find fault\r\nwith what is written incorrectly. (10) Nevertheless, I warrant it is\r\nwritten in this fashion with an eye to rectitude, to make the reader\r\nwise and good, not more sophistical. For I would wish my writings not to\r\nseem but rather to be useful. I would have them stand the test of ages\r\nin their blamelessness.

Estienne (Stephanus) first wrote against\r\n    it \"huic loco meae conjecturae succumbunt,\" has been a puzzle to\r\n    all commentators. The words run: {ou lanthanei de me oti kalos kai\r\n    exes gegraphthai}  ({gegraptai} in the margin of one MS.) {radion\r\n    gar estai autois takhu me orthos mempsasthai' kaitoi gegraptai ge\r\n    outos k.t.l.} For {takhu me orthos} (1) {takhu ti me orthos}, (2)\r\n    {to} (or {ta}) {me orthos}, have been suggested. It is not clear\r\n    whether {autois} = {tois sophistais} (e.g. \"it will be easy for\r\n    these people to lay a finger at once on blots, however unfairly\"),\r\n    or = {tois suggrammasi} (sc. my(?) compositions; so {auta}, S. 7\r\n    below, {ou gar dokein auta boulomai k.t.l.}) (e.g. \"since it will\r\n    be easy offhand to find fault with them incorrectly\")  (or if {ta\r\n    me orthos}, \"what is incorrect in them\"). I append the three\r\n    translations of Gail, Lenz, and Talbot. \"Je sais combien il est\r\n    avantageux de presenter des ouvrages methodiquement ecrits; aussi\r\n    par le meme sera-t-il plus facile de prouver aux sophistes leur\r\n    futilite!\" {radion gar estai}  (sub. {emoi}) {mempsasthai outois\r\n    takhu (to) me} (sous-entendu) {gegraphthai orthos} (Gail). \"Zwar\r\n    entgeht mir nicht, dass es schon say die Worte kunstvoll zu\r\n    ordnen, denn leichter wird ihnen sonst, schnell, aber mit Unrecht\r\n    zu tadeln\" (Lenz). \"Aussi leur sera-t-il facile de me reprocher\r\n    d'ecrire vite et sans ordre\" (Talbot). As if {takhu me orthos}\r\n    were the reproachful comment of the sophist on the author's\r\n    treatise.\r\n\r\n (11) i.e. \"the arguments to be blameless at once and irrefutable for\r\n    all time.\"\r\n\r\nThat is my point of view. The sophist has quite another--words with him\r\nare for the sake of deception, writing for personal gain; to benefit any\r\nother living soul at all is quite beside his mark. There never was\r\nnor is there now a sage among them to whom the title \"wise\" could be\r\napplied. No! the appellation \"sophist\" suffices for each and all, which\r\namong men of common sense (12) sounds like a stigma. My advice then is\r\nto mistrust the sonorous catch-words (13) of the sophist, and not\r\nto despise the reasoned conclusions (14) of the philosopher; for the\r\nsophist is a hunter after the rich and young, the philosopher is the\r\ncommon friend of all; he neither honours nor despises the fortunes of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n (12) L.

(20) Since in proportion as they rob the\r\nprivate citizen of his means and despoil the state (21) they are less\r\nserviceable with a view to the public safety than any private citizen;\r\n(22) and what can be worse or more disgraceful for purposes of war than\r\nthe bodily form of people so incapable of toil? (23) Think of huntsmen\r\nby contrast, surrendering to the common weal person and property alike\r\nin perfect condition for service of the citizens. They have both a\r\nbattle to wage certainly: only the one set are for attacking beasts; and\r\nthe other their own friends. (24) And naturally the assailant of his\r\nown friends does not win the general esteem; (25) whilst the huntsman in\r\nattacking a wild beast may win renown. If successful in his capture, he\r\nwas won a victory over a hostile brood; or failing, in the first place,\r\nit is a feather in his cap that his attempt is made against enemies of\r\nthe whole community; and secondly, that it is not to the detriment of\r\nman nor for love of gain that the field is taken; and thirdly, as the\r\noutcome of the very attempt, the hunter is improved in many respects,\r\nand all the wiser: by what means we will explain. Were it not for\r\nthe very excess of his pains, his well-reasoned devices, his manifold\r\nprecautions, he would never capture the quarry at all; since the\r\nantagonists he deals with are doing battle for bare life and in their\r\nnative haunts, (26) and are consequently in great force. So that if he\r\nfails to overmatch the beasts by a zest for toil transcending theirs and\r\nplentiful intelligence, the huntsman's labours are in vain.\r\n\r\n (15) Or, \"surrender themselves heedlessly to the ways of self-\r\n    seeking.\" But the phraseology here seems to savour of extreme\r\n    youth, or else senility.\r\n\r\n (16) {enthumethenta}.

For the vulg. {auton} see Schneid. ad loc., who\r\n    suggests {ton aston}.\r\n\r\n (18) \"Recognisable for the better.\"\r\n\r\n (19) \"They are not famous but infamous\"; \"the bad fare as their name\r\n    suggests\" (i.e. badly).\r\n\r\n (20) \"Recognisable for the worse.\"\r\n\r\n (21) Or, \"what with private extortionsand public peculation.\"\r\n\r\n (22) {ton idioton}, \"laymen,\" I suppose, as opposed to \"professional\"\r\n    lawyers or politicians.\r\n\r\n (23) \"What with their incapacity for hard work, their physique for\r\n    purposes of war is a mockery and a sham.\"\r\n\r\n (24) Cf. Plat. \"Soph.\"\r\n\r\n (25) Or, \"earns but an evil reputation in the world.\"\r\n\r\n (26) \"They are being bearded in their dens.\"\r\n\r\nI go back to my proposition then. Those self-seeking politicians, who\r\nwant to feather their own nests, (27) practise to win victories over\r\ntheir own side, but the sportsman confines himself to the common enemy.\r\nThis training of theirs renders the one set more able to cope with the\r\nforeign foe, the others far less able. The hunting of the one is carried\r\non with self-restraint, of the others with effrontery. The one can look\r\ndown with contempt upon maliciousness and sordid love of gain, the other\r\ncannot. The very speech and intonation of the one has melody, of the\r\nother harshness. And with regard to things divine, the one set know no\r\nobstacle to their impiety, the others are of all men the most pious.\r\nIndeed ancient tales affirm (28) that the very gods themselves take\r\njoy in this work (29) as actors and spectators. So that, (30) with due\r\nreflection on these things, the young who act upon my admonitions will\r\nbe found, perchance, beloved of heaven and reverent of soul, checked by\r\nthe thought that some one of the gods is eyeing their performance. (31)\r\n\r\n (27) Or, \"Those people who would fain have the lion's share in the\r\n    state.\"\r\n\r\n (28) Or, \"an ancient story obtains.\"\r\n\r\n (29) Sc. \"of the chase.\"\r\n\r\n (30) Or {uparkhein} = \"it may be considered as given.\" Scheid. cf.\r\n    \"Pol. Ath.\" iii. 9, {oste uparkhein demokratian einai}.\r\n\r\n (31) Lit. \"that the things in question are beheld by some divinity.\"\r\n\r\nThese are the youths who will prove a blessing to their parents, and not\r\nto their parents only but to the whole state; to every citizen alike and\r\nindividual friend.\r\n\r\nNay, what has sex to do with it? It is not only men enamoured of the\r\nchase that have become heroes, but among women there are also to whom\r\nour lady Artemis has granted a like boon--Atalanta, and Procris, and\r\nmany another huntress fair.",
