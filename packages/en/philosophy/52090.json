The\r\ntitle page of this edition is reproduced in the present volume. The\r\noriginal was evidently the work of a Dutch compositor unschooled in\r\nthe French language, and is full of imperfections, inconsistencies,\r\nand grammatical blunders. By the direction of the publishers these\r\nobviously typographical blunders have been corrected by M. Lucien\r\nArréat of Paris.\r\n\r\nThe translation is the work of several hands. It is founded on a\r\nversion made by Miss Gertrude C. Bussey (from the French text in the\r\nedition of J. Assezat) and has been revised by Professor M. W. Calkins\r\nwho is responsible for it in its present form. Mademoiselle M. Carret,\r\nof the Wellesley College department of French, and Professor George\r\nSantayana, of Harvard University, have given valued assistance; and\r\nthis opportunity is taken to acknowledge their kindness in solving\r\nthe problems of interpretation which have been submitted to them. It\r\nshould be added that the translation sometimes subordinates the claims\r\nof English structure and style in the effort to render La Mettrie's\r\nmeaning exactly. The paragraphing of the French is usually followed,\r\nbut the italics and the capitals are not reproduced. The page-headings\r\nof the translation refer back to the pages of the French text; and\r\na few words inserted by the translators are enclosed in brackets.\r\n\r\nThe philosophical and historical Notes are condensed and adapted\r\nfrom a master's thesis on La Mettrie presented by Miss Bussey to the\r\nfaculty of Wellesley College.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFREDERIC THE GREAT'S EULOGY ON JULIEN OFFRAY DE LA METTRIE.\r\n\r\n\r\nJulien Offray de la Mettrie was born in Saint Malo, on the twenty-fifth\r\nof December, 1709, to Julien Offray de la Mettrie and Marie Gaudron,\r\nwho were living by a trade large enough to provide a good education\r\nfor their son. They sent him to the college of Coutance to study the\r\nhumanities; he went from there to Paris, to the college of Plessis;\r\nhe studied his rhetoric at Caen, and since he had much genius and\r\nimagination, he won all the prizes for eloquence. He was a born orator,\r\nand was passionately fond of poetry and belles-lettres, but his father\r\nthought that he would earn more as an ecclesiastic than as a poet,\r\nand destined him for the church. He sent him, the following year,\r\nto the college of Plessis where he studied logic under M. Cordier,\r\nwho was more a Jansenist than a logician.\r\n\r\nIt is characteristic of an ardent imagination to seize forcefully\r\nthe objects presented to it, as it is characteristic of youth to be\r\nprejudiced in favor of the first opinions that are inculcated. Any\r\nother scholar would have adopted the opinions of his teacher but\r\nthat was not enough for young La Mettrie; he became a Jansenist,\r\nand wrote a work which had great vogue in that party.\r\n\r\nIn 1725, he studied natural philosophy at the college of Harcourt,\r\nand made great progress there. On his return to Brittany, M. Hunault,\r\na doctor of Saint Malo, had advised him to adopt the medical\r\nprofession. They had persuaded his father, assuring him that a\r\nmediocre physician would be better paid for his remedies than a\r\ngood priest for absolutions. At first young La Mettrie had applied\r\nhimself to the study of anatomy: for two years he had worked at the\r\ndissecting-table. After this, in 1725, he took the degree of doctor\r\nat Rheims, and was there received as a physician.\r\n\r\nIn 1733, he went to Leyden to study under the famous Boerhaave. The\r\nmaster was worthy of the scholar and the scholar soon made himself\r\nworthy of the master. M. La Mettrie devoted all the acuteness of\r\nhis mind to the knowledge and to the healing of human infirmities;\r\nand he soon became a great physician.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1734, during his leisure moments, he translated a\r\ntreatise of the late M. Boerhaave, his Aphrodisiacus, and joined to\r\nit a dissertation on venereal maladies, of which he himself was the\r\nauthor. The old physicians in France rose up against a scholar who\r\naffronted them by knowing as much as they. One of the most celebrated\r\ndoctors of Paris did him the honor of criticizing his work (a sure\r\nproof that it was good). La Mettrie replied; and, to confound his\r\nadversary still more, he composed in 1736 a treatise on vertigo,\r\nesteemed by all impartial physicians.\r\n\r\nBy an unfortunate effect of human imperfection a certain base jealousy\r\nhas come to be one of the characteristics of men of letters. This\r\nfeeling incites those who have reputations, to oppose the progress\r\nof budding geniuses. This blight often fastens on talents without\r\ndestroying them, but it sometimes injures them. M. La Mettrie, who was\r\nadvancing in the career of science at a giant's pace, suffered from\r\nthis jealousy, and his quick temper made him too susceptible to it.\r\n\r\nIn Saint Malo, he translated the \"Aphorisms\" of Boerhaave, the\r\n\"Materia Medica,\" the \"Chemical Proceedings,\" the \"Chemical Theory,\"\r\nand the \"Institutions,\" by this same author. About the same time,\r\nhe published an abstract of Sydenham. The young doctor had learned\r\nby premature experience, that if he wished to live in peace, it was\r\nbetter to translate than to compose; but it is characteristic of\r\ngenius to escape from reflection. Counting on himself alone, if I\r\nmay speak thus, and filled with the knowledge he had gained from his\r\ninfinitely skilful researches into nature, he wished to communicate\r\nto the public the useful discoveries he had made. He published his\r\ntreatise on smallpox, his \"Practical Medicine,\" and six volumes of\r\ncommentary on the physiology of Boerhaave. All these works appeared at\r\nParis, although the author had written them at Saint Malo. He joined\r\nto the theory of his art an always successful practice, which is no\r\nsmall recommendation for a physician.\r\n\r\nIn 1742, La Mettrie came to Paris, led there by the death of\r\nM. Hunault, his old teacher. Morand and Sidobre introduced him to\r\nthe Duke of Gramont, who, a few days after, obtained for him the\r\ncommission of physician of the guards. He accompanied the Duke to\r\nwar, and was with him at the battle of Dettingen, at the siege of\r\nFreiburg, and at the battle of Fontenoy, where he lost his patron,\r\nwho was killed by a cannon shot.\r\n\r\nLa Mettrie felt this loss all the more keenly, because it was at\r\nthe same time the reef on which his fortune was wrecked. This is\r\nwhat happened. During the campaign of Freiburg, La Mettrie had an\r\nattack of violent fever. For a philosopher an illness is a school of\r\nphysiology; he believed that he could clearly see that thought is\r\nbut a consequence of the organization of the machine, and that the\r\ndisturbance of the springs has considerable influence on that part of\r\nus which the metaphysicians call soul. Filled with these ideas during\r\nhis convalescence, he boldly bore the torch of experience into the\r\nnight of metaphysics; he tried to explain by the aid of anatomy the\r\nthin texture of understanding, and he found only mechanism where others\r\nhad supposed an essence superior to matter. He had his philosophic\r\nconjectures printed under the title of \"The Natural History of the\r\nSoul.\" The chaplain of the regiment sounded the tocsin against him,\r\nand at first sight all the devotees cried out against him.\r\n\r\nThe common ecclesiastic is like Don Quixote, who found marvelous\r\nadventures in commonplace events, or like the famous soldier, so\r\nengrossed with his system that he found columns in all the books he\r\nread. The majority of priests examine all works of literature as\r\nif they were treatises on theology, and filled with this one aim,\r\nthey discover heresies everywhere. To this fact are due very many\r\nfalse judgments and very many accusations, for the most part unfair,\r\nagainst the authors. A book of physics should be read in the spirit\r\nof a physicist; nature, the truth, is its sole judge, and should\r\nabsolve or condemn it. A book of astronomy should be read in the same\r\nmanner. If a poor physician proves that the blow of a stick smartly\r\nrapped on the skull disturbs the mind, or that at a certain degree\r\nof heat reason wanders, one must either prove the contrary or keep\r\nquiet. If a skilful astronomer proves, in spite of Joshua, that the\r\nearth and all the celestial globes revolve around the sun, one must\r\neither calculate better than he, or admit that the earth revolves.\r\n\r\nBut the theologians, who, by their continual apprehension, might make\r\nthe weak believe that their cause is bad, are not troubled by such\r\na small matter. They insisted on finding seeds of heresy in a work\r\ndealing with physics. The author underwent a frightful persecution,\r\nand the priests claimed that a doctor accused of heresy could not\r\ncure the French guards.\r\n\r\nTo the hatred of the devotees was joined that of his rivals for\r\nglory. This was rekindled by a work of La Mettrie's entitled \"The\r\nPolitics of Physicians.\" A man full of cunning, and carried away\r\nby ambition, aspired to the place, then vacant, of first physician\r\nto the king of France. He thought that he could gain it by heaping\r\nridicule upon those of his contemporaries who might lay claim to\r\nthis position. He wrote a libel against them, and abusing the easy\r\nfriendship of La Mettrie, he enticed him to lend to it the volubility\r\nof his pen, and the richness of his imagination. Nothing more was\r\nneeded to complete the downfall of a man little known, against whom\r\nwere all appearances, and whose only protection was his merit.\r\n\r\nFor having been too sincere as a philosopher and too obliging as\r\na friend, La Mettrie was compelled to leave his country. The Duke\r\nof Duras and the Viscount of Chaila advised him to flee from the\r\nhatred of the priests and the revenge of the physicians. Therefore,\r\nin 1746, he left the hospitals of the army where he had been placed by\r\nM. Sechelles, and came to Leyden to philosophize in peace. He there\r\ncomposed his \"Penelope,\" a polemical work against the physicians in\r\nwhich, after the fashion of Democritus, he made fun of the vanity of\r\nhis profession. The curious result was that the doctors themselves,\r\nthough their quackery was painted in true colors, could not help\r\nlaughing when they read it, and that is a sure sign that they had\r\nfound more wit than malice in it.\r\n\r\nM. La Mettrie after losing sight of his hospitals and his patients,\r\ngave himself up completely to speculative philosophy; he wrote his\r\n\"Man a Machine\" or rather he put on paper some vigorous thoughts\r\nabout materialism, which he doubtless planned to rewrite. This work,\r\nwhich was bound to displease men who by their position are declared\r\nenemies of the progress of human reason, roused all the priests of\r\nLeyden against its author. Calvinists, Catholics and Lutherans forgot\r\nfor the time that consubstantiation, free will, mass for the dead,\r\nand the infallibility of the pope divided them: they all united\r\nagain to persecute a philosopher who had the additional misfortune\r\nof being French, at a time when that monarchy was waging a successful\r\nwar against their High Powers.\r\n\r\nThe title of philosopher and the reputation of being unfortunate\r\nwere enough to procure for La Mettrie a refuge in Prussia with a\r\npension from the king. He came to Berlin in the month of February\r\nin the year 1748; he was there received as a member of the Royal\r\nAcademy of Science. Medicine reclaimed him from metaphysics, and\r\nhe wrote a treatise on dysentery, another on asthma, the best that\r\nhad then been written on these cruel diseases. He sketched works on\r\ncertain philosophical subjects which he had proposed to look into. By\r\na sequence of accidents which befell him these works were stolen,\r\nbut he demanded their suppression as soon as they appeared.\r\n\r\nLa Mettrie died in the house of Milord Tirconnel, minister\r\nplenipotentiary of France, whose life he had saved. It seems that\r\nthe disease, knowing with whom it had to deal, was clever enough\r\nto attack his brain first, so that it would more surely confound\r\nhim. He had a burning fever and was violently delirious. The invalid\r\nwas obliged to depend upon the science of his colleagues, and he did\r\nnot find there the resources which he had so often found in his own,\r\nboth for himself and for the public.\r\n\r\nHe died on the eleventh of November, 1751, at the age of forty-three\r\nyears. He had married Louise Charlotte Dréano, by whom he left only\r\na daughter, five years and a few months old.\r\n\r\nLa Mettrie was born with a fund of natural and inexhaustible gaiety;\r\nhe had a quick mind, and such a fertile imagination that it made\r\nflowers grow in the field of medicine. Nature had made him an orator\r\nand a philosopher; but a yet more precious gift which he received\r\nfrom her, was a pure soul and an obliging heart. All those who are\r\nnot imposed upon by the pious insults of the theologians mourn in La\r\nMettrie a good man and a wise physician.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACSIMILE OF TITLE PAGE OF THE LEYDEN 1748 EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\n                            L'HOMME MACHINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                Est-ce là ce Raion de l'Essence suprème,\r\n                Que l'on nous peint si lumineux?\r\n                Est-ce là cet Esprit survivant à nous même?\r\n                Il naît avec nos sens, croit, s'affoiblit comme eux.\r\n                Helas! il périra de même.\r\n\r\n                                                            Voltaire.\r\n\r\n                                À LEYDE,\r\n\r\n                     De l'Imp. d'ELIE LUZAC, Fils.\r\n\r\n                                 -----\r\n\r\n                              MDCCXLVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nL'HOMME MACHINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIl ne suffit pas à un sage d'étudier la nature et la vérité; il doit\r\noser la dire en faveur du petit nombre de ceux qui veulent et peuvent\r\npenser; car pour les autres, qui sont volontairement esclaves des\r\npréjugés, il ne leur est pas plus possible d'atteindre la vérité,\r\nqu'aux grenouilles de voler.\r\n\r\nJe réduis à deux les systèmes des philosophes sur l'âme de l'homme. Le\r\npremier, et le plus ancien, est le système du matérialisme; le second\r\nest celui du spiritualisme.\r\n\r\nLes métaphysiciens qui ont insinué que la matière pourrait bien avoir\r\nla faculté de penser, n'ont pas déshonoré leur raison. Pourquoi? C'est\r\nqu'ils ont cet avantage (car ici c'en est un) de s'être mal\r\nexprimés. En effet, demander si la matière peut penser, sans la\r\nconsidérer autrement qu'en elle-même, c'est demander si la matière peut\r\nmarquer les heures. On voit d'avance que nous éviterons cet écueil,\r\noù Mr. Locke a eu le malheur d'échouer.\r\n\r\nLes Leibniziens, avec leurs monades, ont élevé une hypothèse\r\ninintelligible. Ils ont plutôt spiritualisé la matière, que matérialisé\r\nl'âme. Comment peut-on définir un être dont la nature nous est\r\nabsolument inconnue?\r\n\r\nDescartes, et tous les Cartésiens, parmi lesquels il y a longtemps\r\nqu'on a compté les Malebranchistes, ont fait la même faute. Ils ont\r\nadmis deux substances distinctes dans l'homme, comme s'ils les avaient\r\nvues et bien comptées.\r\n\r\nLes plus sages ont dit que l'âme ne pouvait se connaître que par les\r\nseules lumières de la Foi: cependant, en qualité d'êtres raisonnables,\r\nils ont cru pouvoir se réserver le droit d'examiner ce que l'Ecriture\r\na voulu dire par le mot Esprit, dont elle se sert en parlant de l'âme\r\nhumaine; et dans leurs recherches, s'ils ne sont pas d'accord sur ce\r\npoint avec les théologiens, ceux-ci le sont-ils davantage entr'eux\r\nsur tous les autres?\r\n\r\nVoici en peu de mots le résultat de toutes leurs réflexions.\r\n\r\nS'il y a un Dieu, il est auteur de la Nature, comme de la Révélation;\r\nil nous a donné l'une, pour expliquer l'autre; et la Raison, pour\r\nles accorder ensemble.\r\n\r\nSe défier des connaissances qu'on peut puiser dans les corps animés,\r\nc'est regarder la Nature et la Révélation comme deux contraires qui\r\nse détruisent; et par conséquent, c'est oser soutenir cette absurdité:\r\nque Dieu se contredit dans ses divers ouvrages, et nous trompe.\r\n\r\nS'il y a une Révélation, elle ne peut donc démentir la Nature. Par la\r\nNature seule, on peut découvrir le sens des paroles de l'Evangile,\r\ndont l'expérience seule est la véritable interprète. En effet,\r\nles autres commentateurs jusqu'ici n'ont fait qu'embrouiller\r\nla vérité. Nous allons en juger par l'auteur du Spectacle de la\r\nNature. \"Il est étonnant, dit-il (au sujet de Mr. Locke), qu'un homme\r\nqui dégrade notre âme jusqu'à la croire une âme de boue, ose établir\r\nla Raison pour juge et souverain arbitre des mystères de la Foi;\r\ncar, ajoute-t-il, quelle idée étonnante aurait-on du Christianisme,\r\nsi l'on voulait suivre la Raison?\"\r\n\r\nOutre que ces réflexions n'éclaircissent rien par rapport à la Foi,\r\nelles forment de si frivoles objections contre la méthode de ceux\r\nqui croient pouvoir interpréter les Livres Saints, que j'ai presque\r\nhonte de perdre le temps à les réfuter.\r\n\r\n1º. L'excellence de la Raison ne dépend pas d'un grand mot vide de\r\nsens (l'immatérialité); mais de sa force, de son étendue, ou de sa\r\nclairvoyance. Ainsi une âme de boue, qui découvrirait, comme d'un coup\r\nd'oeil, les rapports et les suites d'une infinité d'idées difficiles\r\nà saisir, serait évidemment préférable à une âme sotte et stupide\r\nqui serait faite des éléments les plus précieux. Ce n'est pas être\r\nphilosophe, que de rougir avec Pline de la misère de notre origine. Ce\r\nqui parait vil, est ici la chose la plus précieuse, et pour laquelle\r\nla nature semble avoir mis le plus d'art et le plus d'appareil. Mais\r\ncomme l'homme, quand même il viendrait d'une source encore plus vile\r\nen apparence, n'en serait pas moins le plus parfait de tous les êtres,\r\nquelle que soit l'origine de son âme, si elle est pure, noble, sublime,\r\nc'est une belle âme, qui rend respectable quiconque en est doué.\r\n\r\nLa seconde manière de raisonner de Mr. Pluche me parait vicieuse, même\r\ndans son système, qui tient un peu du fanatisme; car si nous avons\r\nune idée de la Foi, qui soit contraire aux principes les plus clairs,\r\naux vérités les plus incontestables, il faut croire, pour l'honneur\r\nde la Révélation et de son Auteur, que cette idée est fausse, et que\r\nnous ne connaissons point encore les sens des paroles de l'Evangile.\r\n\r\nDe deux choses l'une; ou tout est illusion, tant la Nature même, que la\r\nRévélation; ou l'expérience seule peut rendre raison de la Foi. Mais\r\nquel plus grand ridicule que celui de notre auteur? Je m'imagine\r\nentendre un péripatéticien, qui dirait: \"Il ne faut pas croire\r\nl'expérience de Toricelli: car si nous la croyions, si nous allions\r\nbannir l'horreur du vide, quelle étonnante philosophie aurions-nous?\"\r\n\r\nJ'ai fait voir combien le raisonnement de Mr. Pluche est vicieux,\r\n[1] afin de prouver premièrement que s'il y a une Révélation, elle\r\nn'est point suffisamment démontrée par la seule autorité de l'Eglise\r\net sans aucun examen de la Raison, comme le prétendent tous ceux qui\r\nla craignent. Secondement, pour mettre à l'abri de toute attaque la\r\nméthode de ceux qui voudraient suivre la voie que je leur ouvre,\r\nd'interpréter les choses surnaturelles, incompréhensibles en soi,\r\npar les lumières que chacun a reçues de la nature.\r\n\r\nL'expérience et l'observation doivent donc seules nous guider\r\nici. Elles se trouvent sans nombre dans les Fastes des médecins, qui\r\nont été philosophes, et non dans les philosophes, qui n'ont pas été\r\nmédecins. Ceux-ci ont parcouru, ont éclairé le labyrinthe de l'homme;\r\nils nous ont seuls dévoilé ces ressorts cachés sous des enveloppes\r\nqui dérobent à nos yeux tant de merveilles. Eux seuls, contemplant\r\ntranquillement notre âme, l'ont mille fois surprise, et dans sa misère,\r\net dans sa grandeur, sans plus la mépriser dans l'un de ces états, que\r\nl'admirer dans l'autre. Encore une fois, voilà les seuls physiciens qui\r\naient droit de parler ici. Que nous diraient les autres, et surtout\r\nles théologiens? N'est-il pas ridicule de les entendre décider sans\r\npudeur, sur un sujet qu'ils n'ont point été à portée de connaître,\r\ndont ils ont été au contraire entièrement détournés par des études\r\nobscures, qui les ont conduits à mille préjugés, et pour tout dire\r\nen un mot, au fanatisme, qui ajoute encore à leur ignorance dans le\r\nmécanisme des corps.\r\n\r\nMais, quoique nous ayons choisi les meilleurs guides, nous trouverons\r\nencore beaucoup d'épines et d'obstacles dans cette carrière.\r\n\r\nL'homme est une machine si composée, qu'il est impossible de s'en\r\nfaire d'abord une idée claire, et conséquemment de la définir. C'est\r\npourquoi toutes les recherches que les plus grands philosophes ont\r\nfaites à priori, c'est à dire, en voulant se servir en quelque sorte\r\ndes ailes de l'esprit, ont été vaines. Ainsi ce n'est qu'à posteriori,\r\nou en cherchant à demêler l'âme comme au travers les organes du corps,\r\nqu'on peut, je ne dis pas découvrir avec évidence la nature même de\r\nl'homme, mais atteindre le plus grand degré de probabilité possible\r\nsur ce sujet.\r\n\r\nPrenons donc le bâton de l'expérience, et laissons là l'histoire de\r\ntoutes les vaines opinions des philosophes. Etre aveugle, et croire\r\npouvoir se passer de ce bâton, c'est le comble de l'aveuglement. Qu'un\r\nmoderne a bien raison de dire qu'il n'y a que la vanité seule qui ne\r\ntire pas des causes secondes le même parti que des premières! On peut\r\net on doit même admirer tous ces beaux génies dans leurs travaux les\r\nplus inutiles, les Descartes, les Malebranche, les Leibnitz, les Wolf,\r\netc.; mais quel fruit, je vous prie, a-t-on retiré de leurs profondes\r\nméditations et de tous leurs ouvrages? Commençons donc et voyons, non\r\nce qu'on a pensé, mais ce qu'il faut penser pour le repos de la vie.\r\n\r\nAutant de tempéraments, autant d'esprits, de caractères et de moeurs\r\ndifférentes. Galien même a connu cette vérité, que Descartes, et non\r\nHippocrate, comme le dit l'auteur de l'histoire de l'Ame, a poussée\r\nloin, jusqu'à dire que la médecine seule pouvait changer les esprits\r\net les moeurs avec le corps. Il est vrai, la mélancolie, la bile, le\r\nphlegme, le sang etc., suivant la nature, l'abondance et la diverse\r\ncombinaison de ces humeurs, de chaque homme font un homme différent.\r\n\r\nDans les maladies, tantôt l'âme s'éclipse et ne montre aucun signe\r\nd'elle-même; tantôt on dirait qu'elle est double, tant la fureur la\r\ntransporte; tantôt l'imbécilité se dissipe: et la convalescence d'un\r\nsot fait un homme d'esprit. Tantôt le plus beau génie devenu stupide,\r\nne se reconnait plus. Adieu toutes ces belles connaissances acquises\r\nà si grands frais, et avec tant de peine!\r\n\r\nIci c'est un paralytique, qui demande si sa jambe est dans son lit: là\r\nc'est un soldat qui croit avoir le bras qu'on lui a coupé. La mémoire\r\nde ses anciennes sensations, et du lieu où son âme les rapportait,\r\nfait son illusion et son espèce de délire. Il suffit de lui parler de\r\ncette partie qui lui manque, pour lui en rappeller et faire sentir\r\ntous les mouvements; ce qui se fait avec je ne sais quel déplaisir\r\nd'imagination qu'on ne peut exprimer.\r\n\r\nCelui-ci pleure, comme un enfant, aux approches de la mort, que\r\ncelui-là badine. Que fallait-il à Caius Julius, à Sénèque, à Pétrone\r\npour changer leur intrépidité en pusillanimité ou en poltronnerie? Une\r\nobstruction dans la rate, dans le foie, un embarras dans la veine\r\nporte. Pourquoi? Parceque l'imagination se bouche avec les viscères;\r\net de là naissent tous ces singuliers phénomènes de l'affection\r\nhystérique et hypocondriaque.\r\n\r\nQue dirais-je de nouveau sur ceux qui s'imaginent être transformés\r\nen loups-garous, en coqs, en vampires, qui croient que les morts\r\nles sucent? Pourquoi m'arrêterais-je à ceux qui voient leur nez, ou\r\nautres membres, de verre, et à qui il faut conseiller de coucher sur\r\nla paille, de peur qu'ils ne se cassent, afin qu'ils en retrouvent\r\nl'usage et la véritable chair, lorsque mettant le feu à la paille on\r\nleur fait craindre d'être brûlés: frayeur qui a quelquefois guéri la\r\nparalysie? Je dois légèrement passer sur des choses connues de tout\r\nle monde.\r\n\r\nJe ne serai pas plus long sur le détail des effets du sommeil. Voyez\r\nce soldat fatigué! il ronfle dans la tranchée, au bruit de cent\r\npièces de canons! Son âme n'entend rien, son sommeil est une parfaite\r\napoplexie. Une bombe va l'écraser; il sentira peut-être moins ce coup\r\nqu'un insecte qui se trouve sous le pied.\r\n\r\nD'un autre côté, cet homme que la jalousie, la haine, l'avarice\r\nou l'ambition dévore, ne peut trouver aucun repos. Le lieu le plus\r\ntranquille, les boissons les plus fraîches et les plus calmantes, tout\r\nest inutile à qui n'a pas délivré son coeur du tourment des passions.\r\n\r\nL'âme et le corps s'endorment ensemble. A mesure que le mouvement du\r\nsang se calme, un doux sentiment de paix et de tranquillité se répand\r\ndans toute la machine; l'âme se sent mollement s'appesantir avec les\r\npaupières et s'affaisser avec les fibres du cerveau: elle devient ainsi\r\npeu à peu comme paralytique, avec tous les muscles du corps. Ceux-ci ne\r\npeuvent plus porter le poids de la tête; celle là ne peut plus soutenir\r\nle fardeau de la pensée; elle est dans le sommeil, comme n'étant point.\r\n\r\nLa circulation se fait-elle avec trop de vitesse? l'âme ne peut\r\ndormir. L'âme est-elle trop agitée, le sang ne peut se calmer;\r\nil galope dans les veines avec un bruit qu'on entend: telles sont\r\nles deux causes réciproques de l'insomnie. Une seule frayeur dans\r\nles songes fait battre le coeur à coups redoublés, et nous arrache\r\nà la nécessité, ou à la douceur du repos, comme feraient une vive\r\ndouleur ou des besoins urgents. Enfin, comme la seule cessation des\r\nfonctions de l'âme procure le sommeil, il est, même pendant la veille\r\n(qui n'est alors qu'une demi-veille), des sortes de petits sommeils\r\nd'âme très fréquents, des rêves à la Suisse, qui prouvent que l'âme\r\nn'attend pas toujours le corps pour dormir; car si elle ne dort pas\r\ntout-à-fait, combien peu s'en faut-il! puisqu'il lui est impossible\r\nd'assigner un seul objet auquel elle ait prêté quelque attention,\r\nparmi cette foule innombrable d'idées confuses, qui comme autant de\r\nnuages remplissent, pour ainsi dire, l'atmosphère de notre cerveau.\r\n\r\nL'opium a trop de rapport avec le sommeil qu'il procure, pour ne\r\npas le placer ici. Ce remède enivre, ainsi que le vin, le café,\r\net chacun à sa manière, et suivant sa dose. Il rend l'homme heureux\r\ndans un état qui semblerait devoir être le tombeau du sentiment,\r\ncomme il est l'image de la mort. Quelle douce léthargie! L'âme n'en\r\nvoudrait jamais sortir. Elle était en proie aux plus grandes douleurs;\r\nelle ne sent plus que le seul plaisir de ne plus suffrir et de jouir\r\nde la plus charmante tranquillité. L'opium change jusqu'à la volonté;\r\nil force l'âme qui voulait veiller et se divertir, d'aller se mettre\r\nau lit malgré elle. Je passe sous silence l'histoire des poisons.\r\n\r\nC'est en fouettant l'imagination, que le café, cet antidote du vin,\r\ndissipe nos maux de tête et nos chagrins, sans nous en ménager,\r\ncomme cette liqueur, pour le lendemain.\r\n\r\nContemplons l'âme dans ses autres besoins.\r\n\r\nLe corps humain est une machine qui monte elle-même ses ressorts;\r\nvivante image du mouvement perpétuel. Les aliments entretiennent\r\nce que la fièvre excite. Sans eux l'âme languit, entre en fureur et\r\nmeurt abattue. C'est une bougie dont la lumière se ranime, au moment\r\nde s'éteindre. Mais nourrissez le corps, versez dans ses tuyaux des\r\nsucs vigoureux, des liqueurs fortes; alors l'âme généreuse comme\r\nelles s'arme d'un fier courage et le soldat que l'eau eut fait fuir,\r\ndevenu féroce, court gaiement à la mort au bruit des tambours. C'est\r\nainsi que l'eau chaude agite un sang que l'eau froide eut calmé.\r\n\r\nQuelle puissance d'un repas! La joie renaît dans un coeur triste;\r\nelle passe dans l'âme des convives qui l'expriment par d'aimables\r\nchansons, où les Français excellent. Le mélancolique seul est accablé,\r\net l'homme d'étude n'y est plus propre.\r\n\r\nLa viande crue rend les animaux féroces; les hommes le deviendraient\r\npar la même nourriture; cela est si vrai, que la nation anglaise,\r\nqui ne mange pas la chair si cuite que nous, mais rouge et sanglante,\r\nparait participer de cette férocité plus ou moins grande, qui vient\r\nen partie de tels aliments, et d'autres causes, que l'éducation\r\npeut seule rendre impuissantes. Cette férocité produit dans l'âme\r\nl'orgueil, la haine, le mépris des autres nations, l'indocilité et\r\nautres sentiments, qui dépravent le caractère, comme des aliments\r\ngrossiers font un esprit lourd, épais, dont la paresse et l'indolence\r\nsont les attributs favoris.\r\n\r\nMr. Pope a bien connu tout l'empire de la gourmandise, lorsqu'il dit:\r\n\"Le grave Catius parle toujours de vertu, et croit que, qui souffre\r\nles vicieux est vicieux lui-même. Ces beaux sentiments durent jusqu'à\r\nl'heure du diner; alors il préfère un scélérat, qui a une table\r\ndélicate, à un saint frugal.\r\n\r\n\"Considérez, dit-il ailleurs, le même homme en santé, ou en maladie;\r\npossédant une belle charge, ou l'ayant perdue; vous le verrez chérir\r\nla vie, ou la détester, fou à la chasse, ivrogne dans une assemblée\r\nde province, poli au bal, bon ami en ville, sans foi à la cour.\"\r\n\r\nNous avons eu en Suisse un bailli, nommé Steiguer de Wittighofen;\r\nil était à jeûn le plus intègre et même le plus indulgent des juges;\r\nmais malheur au misérable qui se trouvait sur la sellette, lorsqu'il\r\navait fait un grand diner! Il était homme à faire pendre l'innocent,\r\ncomme le coupable.\r\n\r\nNous pensons, et même nous ne sommes honnêtes gens, que comme nous\r\nsommes gais, ou braves; tout dépend de la manière dont notre machine\r\nest montée. On dirait en certains moments que l'âme habite dans\r\nl'estomac, et que Van Helmont, en mettant son siège dans le pylore,\r\nne se serait trompé qu'en prenant la partie pour le tout.\r\n\r\nA quels excès la faim cruelle peut nous porter! Plus de respect\r\npour les entrailles auxquelles on doit ou on a donné la vie; on les\r\ndéchire à belles dents, on s'en fait d'horribles festins; et dans la\r\nfureur dont on est transporté, le plus faible est toujours la proie\r\ndu plus fort.\r\n\r\nLa grossesse, cette émule désirée des pâles couleurs, ne se contente\r\npas d'amener le plus souvent à sa suite les goûts dépravés qui\r\naccompagnent ces deux états: elle a quelquefois fait exécuter à l'âme\r\nles plus affreux complots; effets d'une manie subite, qui étouffe\r\njusqu'à la loi naturelle. C'est ainsi que le cerveau, cette matrice\r\nde l'esprit, se pervertit à sa manière, avec celle du corps.\r\n\r\nQuelle autre fureur d'homme ou de femme, dans ceux que la continence\r\net la santé poursuivent! C'est peu pour cette fille timide et modeste\r\nd'avoir perdu toute honte et toute pudeur; elle ne regarde plus\r\nl'inceste, que comme une femme galante regarde l'adultère. Si ses\r\nbesoins ne trouvent pas de prompts soulagements, ils ne se borneront\r\npoint aux simples accidents d'une passion utérine, à la manie, etc.;\r\ncette malheureuse mourra d'un mal, dont il y a tant de médecins.\r\n\r\nIl ne faut que des yeux pour voir l'influence nécessaire de l'âge\r\nsur la raison. L'âme suit les progrès du corps, comme ceux de\r\nl'éducation. Dans le beau sexe, l'âme suit encore la délicatesse du\r\ntempérament: de là cette tendresse, cette affection, ces sentiments\r\nvifs, plutôt fondés sur la passion que sur la raison, ces préjugés,\r\nces superstitions, dont la forte empreinte peut à peine s'effacer,\r\netc. L'homme, au contraire, dont le cerveau et les nerfs participent\r\nde la fermeté de tous les solides, a l'esprit, ainsi que les traits\r\ndu visage, plus nerveux: l'éducation, dont manquent les femmes,\r\najoute encore de nouveaux degrés de force à son âme. Avec de tels\r\nsecours de la nature et de l'art, comment ne serait-il pas plus\r\nreconnaissant, plus généreux, plus constant en amitié, plus ferme dans\r\nl'adversité? etc. Mais, suivant à peu près la pensée de l'auteur des\r\nLettres sur les Physionomies, qui joint les grâces de l'esprit et du\r\ncorps à presque tous les sentiments du cœur les plus tendres et les\r\nplus délicats ne doit point nous envier une double force, qui ne semble\r\navoir été donnée à l'homme, l'une, que pour se mieux pénétrer des\r\nattraits de la beauté, l'autre, que pour mieux servir à ses plaisirs.\r\n\r\nIl n'est pas plus nécessaire d'être aussi grand physionomiste que cet\r\nauteur pour deviner la qualité de l'esprit par la figure ou la forme\r\ndes traits, lorsqu'ils sont marqués jusqu'à un certain point, qu'il ne\r\nl'est d'être grand médecin pour connaître un mal accompagné de tous\r\nses symptomes évidents. Examinez les portraits de Locke, de Steele,\r\nde Boerhaave, de Maupertuis, etc. vous ne serez point surpris de leur\r\ntrouver des physionomies fortes, des yeux d'aigle. Parcourez-en une\r\ninfinité d'autres, vous distinguerez toujours le beau du grand génie,\r\net même souvent l'honnête homme du fripon. On a remarqué, par exemple,\r\nqu'un poète célèbre réunit (dans son portrait) l'air d'un filou,\r\navec le feu de Prométhée.\r\n\r\nL'histoire nous offre un mémorable exemple de la puissance de l'air. Le\r\nfameux Duc de Guise était si fort convaincu que Henri III. qui l'avait\r\neu tant de fois en son pouvoir, n'oserait jamais l'assassiner, qu'il\r\npartit pour Blois. Le chancelier Chyverni apprenant son départ,\r\ns'écria: voilà un homme perdu! Lorsque sa fatale prédiction fut\r\njustifiée par l'événement, on lui en demanda la raison. Il y a vingt\r\nans, dit-il, que je connais le Roi; il est naturellement bon et même\r\nfaible; mais j'ai observé qu'un rien l'impatiente et le met en fureur,\r\nlorsqu'il fait froid.\r\n\r\nTel peuple a l'esprit lourd et stupide; tel autre l'a vif, léger,\r\npénétrant. D'où cela vient-il, si ce n'est en partie, et de la\r\nnourriture qu'il prend, et de la semence de ses pères, [2] et de ce\r\nchaos de divers éléments qui nagent dans l'immensité de l'air? L'esprit\r\na, comme le corps, ses maladies épidémiques et son scorbut.\r\n\r\nTel est l'empire du climat, qu'un homme qui en change se ressent\r\nmalgré lui de ce changement. C'est une plante ambulante, qui s'est\r\nelle-même transplantée; si le climat n'est plus le même, il est juste\r\nqu'elle dégénère, ou s'améliore.\r\n\r\nOn prend tout encore de ceux avec qui l'on vit, leurs gestes, leurs\r\naccents, etc., comme la paupière se baisse à la menace du coup dont\r\non est prévenu, ou par la même raison que le corps du spectateur imite\r\nmachinalement, et malgré lui, tous les mouvements d'un bon pantomime.\r\n\r\nCe que je viens de dire prouve que la meilleure compagnie pour un homme\r\nd'esprit, est la sienne, s'il n'en trouve une semblable. L'esprit se\r\nrouille avec ceux qui n'en ont point, faute d'être exercé: à la paume,\r\non renvoie mal la balle à qui la sert mal. J'aimerais mieux un homme\r\nintelligent, qui n'aurait eu aucune éducation, que s'il en eût eu une\r\nmauvaise, pourvu qu'il fût encore assez jeune. Un esprit mal conduit\r\nest un acteur que la province a gâté.\r\n\r\nLes divers états de l'âme sont donc toujours corrélatifs à ceux du\r\ncorps. Mais, pour mieux démontrer toute cette dépendance et ses causes,\r\nservons-nous ici de l'anatomie comparée; ouvrons les entrailles de\r\nl'homme et des animaux. Le moyen de connaître la nature humaine, si\r\nl'on n'est éclairé par un juste parallèle de la structure des uns et\r\ndes autres!\r\n\r\nEn général, la forme et la composition du cerveau des quadrupèdes est\r\nà peu près la même que dans l'homme. Même figure, même disposition\r\npartout; avec cette différence essentielle, que l'homme est de tous\r\nles animaux celui qui a le plus de cerveau, et le cerveau le plus\r\ntortueux, en raison de la masse de son corps. Ensuite le singe, le\r\ncastor, l'éléphant, le chien, le renard, le chat, etc., voilà les\r\nanimaux qui ressemblent le plus à l'homme; car on remarque aussi chez\r\neux la même analogie graduée, par rapport au corps calleux, dans lequel\r\nLancisi avait établi le siège de l'âme, avant feu Mr. de la Peyronnie,\r\nqui cependant a illustré cette opinion par une foule d'expériences.\r\n\r\nAprès tous les quadrupèdes, ce sont les oiseaux qui ont le plus de\r\ncerveau. Les poissons ont la tête grosse; mais elle est vide de sens,\r\ncomme celle de bien des hommes. Ils n'ont point de corps calleux et\r\nfort peu de cerveau, lequel manque aux insectes.\r\n\r\nJe ne me répandrai point en un plus long détail des variétés de la\r\nnature, ni en conjectures, car les unes et les autres sont infinies,\r\ncomme on en peut juger en lisant les seuls traités de Willis, De\r\nCerebro, et De Anima Brutorum.\r\n\r\nJe conclûrai seulement ce qui s'en suit clairement de ces\r\nincontestables observations: 1o que plus les animaux sont farouches,\r\nmoins ils ont de cerveau; 2o que ce viscère semble s'agrandir, en\r\nquelque sorte, à proportion de leur docilité; 3o qu'il y a ici une\r\nsingulière condition imposée éternellement par la nature, qui est\r\nque plus on gagnera du côté de l'esprit, plus on perdra du côté de\r\nl'instinct. Lequel l'emporte, de la perte ou du gain?\r\n\r\nNe croyez pas, au reste, que je veuille prétendre par là que le seul\r\nvolume du cerveau suffise pour faire juger du degré de docilité des\r\nanimaux; il faut que la qualité réponde encore à la quantité, et que\r\nles solides et les fluides soient dans cet équilibre convenable qui\r\nfait la santé.\r\n\r\nSi l'imbécile ne manque pas de cerveau, comme on le remarque\r\nordinairement, ce viscère péchera par une mauvaise consistance, par\r\ntrop de mollesse, par exemple. Il en est de même des fous; les vices\r\nde leur cerveau ne se dérobent pas toujours à nos recherches; mais si\r\nles causes de l'imbécilité, de la folie, etc. ne sont pas sensibles,\r\noù aller chercher celles de la variété de tous les esprits? Elles\r\néchapperaient aux yeux des lynx et des argus. Un rien, une petite\r\nfibre, quelque chose que la plus subtile anatomie ne peut découvrir,\r\neut fait deux sots d'Erasme et de Fontenelle, qui le remarque lui\r\nmême dans un de ses meilleurs Dialogues.\r\n\r\nOutre la mollesse de la moëlle du cerveau, dans les enfants, dans\r\nles petits chiens et dans les oiseaux, Willis a remarqué que les\r\ncorps cannelés sont effacés et comme décolorés dans tous ces animaux,\r\net que leurs stries sont aussi imparfaitement formées que dans les\r\nparalytiques. Il ajoute, ce qui est vrai, que l'homme a la protubérance\r\nannulaire fort grosse; et ensuite toujours diminutivement par dégrés,\r\nle singe et les autres animaux nommés ci-devant, tandis que le veau,\r\nle boeuf, le loup, la brebis, le cochon, etc. qui ont cette partie\r\nd'un très petit volume, ont les nattes et testes fort gros.\r\n\r\nOn a beau être discret et réservé sur les conséquences qu'on peut tirer\r\nde ces observations et de tant d'autres sur l'espèce d'inconstance\r\ndes vaisseaux et des nerfs, etc.: tant de variétés ne peuvent être\r\ndes jeux gratuits de la nature. Elles prouvent du moins la nécessité\r\nd'une bonne et abondante organisation, puisque dans tout le règne\r\nanimal l'âme, se raffermissant avec le corps, acquiert de la sagacité,\r\nà mesure qu'il prend des forces.\r\n\r\nArrêtons-nous à contempler la différente docilité des animaux. Sans\r\ndoute l'analogie la mieux entendue conduit l'esprit à croire que les\r\ncauses dont nous avons fait mention produisent toute la diversité qui\r\nse trouve entr'eux et nous, quoiqu'il faille avouer que notre faible\r\nentendement, borné aux observations les plus grossières, ne puisse\r\nvoir les liens qui règnent entre la cause et les effets. C'est une\r\nespèce d'harmonie que les philosophes ne connaîtront jamais.\r\n\r\nParmi les animaux, les uns apprennent à parler et à chanter; ils\r\nretiennent des airs et prennent tous les tons aussi exactement qu'un\r\nmusicien. Les autres, qui montrent cependant plus d'esprit, tels que\r\nle singe, n'en peuvent venir à bout. Pourquoi cela, si ce n'est par\r\nun vice des organes de la parole?\r\n\r\nMais ce vice est-il tellement de conformation, qu'on n'y puisse\r\napporter aucun remède? en un mot serait-il absolument impossible\r\nd'apprendre une langue à cet animal? Je ne le crois pas.\r\n\r\nJe prendrais le grand singe préférablement à tout autre, jusqu'à ce que\r\nle hasard nous eût fait découvrir quelque autre espèce plus semblable à\r\nla nôtre, car rien ne répugne qu'il y en ait dans des régions qui nous\r\nsont inconnues. Cet animal nous ressemble si fort, que les naturalistes\r\nl'ont appelé homme sauvage, ou homme des bois. Je le prendrais aux\r\nmêmes conditions des écoliers d'Amman; c'est-à-dire, que je voudrais\r\nqu'il ne fût ni trop jeune ni trop vieux; car ceux qu'on nous apporte\r\nen Europe sont communément trop âgés. Je choisirais celui qui aurait\r\nla physionomie la plus spirituelle, et qui tiendrait le mieux dans\r\nmille petites opérations ce qu'elle m'aurait promis. Enfin, ne me\r\ntrouvant pas digne d'être son gouverneur, je le mettrais à l'école de\r\nl'excellent maître que je viens de nommer, ou d'un autre aussi habile,\r\ns'il en est.\r\n\r\nVous savez par le livre d'Amman, et par tous ceux [3] qui ont traduit\r\nsa méthode, tous les prodiges qu'il a su opérer sur les sourds de\r\nnaissance, dans les yeux desquels il a, comme il le fait entendre\r\nlui-même, trouvé des oreilles; et en combien peu de temps enfin il leur\r\na appris à entendre, parler, lire, et écrire. Je veux que les yeux\r\nd'un sourd voient plus clair et soient plus intelligents que s'il ne\r\nl'était pas, par la raison que la perte d'un membre ou d'un sens peut\r\naugmenter la force ou la pénétration d'un autre: mais le singe voit\r\net entend; il comprend ce qu'il entend et ce qu'il voit; il conçoit\r\nsi parfaitement les signes qu'on lui fait, qu'à tout autre jeu, ou\r\ntout autre exercice, je ne doute point qu'il ne l'emportât sur les\r\ndisciples d'Amman. Pourquoi donc l'éducation des singes serait-elle\r\nimpossible? Pourquoi ne pourrait-il enfin, à force de soins, imiter,\r\nà l'exemple des sourds, les mouvemens nécessaires pour prononcer? Je\r\nn'ose décider si les organes de la parole du singe ne peuvent,\r\nquoiqu'on fasse, rien articuler; mais cette impossibilité absolue me\r\nsurprendrait, à cause de la grande analogie du singe et de l'homme,\r\net qu'il n'est point d'animal connu jusqu'à présent, dont le dedans\r\net le dehors lui ressemblent d'une manière si frappante. Mr. Locke,\r\nqui certainement n'a jamais été suspect de crédulité, n'a pas fait\r\ndifficulté de croire l'histoire que le Chevalier Temple fait dans\r\nses Mémoires, d'un perroquet qui répondait à propos et avait appris,\r\ncomme nous, à avoir une espèce de conversation suivie. Je sais\r\nqu'on s'est moqué [4] de ce grand métaphysicien; mais qui aurait\r\nannoncé à l'univers qu'il y a des générations qui se font sans oeufs\r\net sans femmes, aurait-il trouvé beaucoup de partisans? Cependant\r\nMr. Trembley en a découvert, qui se font sans accouplement, et par la\r\nseule section. Amman n'eût-il pas aussi passé pour un fou, s'il se\r\nfût vanté, avant que d'en faire l'heureuse expérience, d'instruire,\r\net en aussi peu de temps, des écoliers tels que les siens? Cependant\r\nses succès ont étonné l'univers, et comme l'auteur de l'Histoire des\r\nPolypes, il a passé de plein vol à l'immortalité. Qui doit à son génie\r\nles miracles qu'il opère, l'emporte à mon gré sur qui doit les siens\r\nau hasard. Qui a trouvé l'art d'embellir le plus beau des règnes,\r\net de lui donner des perfections qu'il n'avait pas, doit être mis\r\nau-dessus d'un faiseur oisif de systèmes frivoles, ou d'un auteur\r\nlaborieux de stériles découvertes. Celles d'Amman sont bien d'un\r\nautre prix; il a tiré les hommes de l'instinct auquel ils semblaient\r\ncondamnés; il leur a donné les idées, de l'esprit, une âme en un mot,\r\nqu'ils n'eûssent jamais eue. Quel plus grand pouvoir!\r\n\r\nNe bornons point les ressources de la nature; elles sont infinies,\r\nsurtout aidées d'un grand art.\r\n\r\nLa même mécanique, qui ouvre le canal d'Eustachi dans les sourds, ne\r\npourrait-il le déboucher dans les singes? Une heureuse envie d'imiter\r\nla prononciation du maître, ne pourrait-elle mettre en liberté les\r\norganes de la parole, dans les animaux qui imitent tant d'autres\r\nsignes, avec tant d'adresse et d'intelligence? Non seulement je défie\r\nqu'on me cite aucune expérience vraiment concluante, qui décide mon\r\nprojet impossible et ridicule; mais la similitude de la structure et\r\ndes opérations du singe est telle, que je ne doute presque point, si\r\non exerçait parfaitement cet animal, qu'on ne vînt enfin à bout de lui\r\napprendre à prononcer, et par conséquent à savoir une langue. Alors\r\nce ne serait plus ni un homme sauvage, ni un homme manqué: ce serait\r\nun homme parfait, un petit homme de ville, avec autant d'étoffe ou\r\nde muscles que nous-mêmes, pour penser et profiter de son éducation.\r\n\r\nDes animaux à l'homme, la transition n'est pas violente; les vrais\r\nphilosophes en conviendront. Qu'était l'homme, avant l'invention des\r\nmots et la connaissance des langues? Un animal de son espèce, qui avec\r\nbeaucoup moins d'instinct naturel que les autres, dont alors il ne\r\nse croyait pas roi, n'était distingué du singe et des autres animaux\r\nque comme le singe l'est lui-même; je veux dire par une physionomie\r\nqui annonçait plus de discernement. Réduit à la seule connaissance\r\nintuitive des Leibniziens, il ne voyait que des figures et des\r\ncouleurs, sans pouvoir rien distinguer entr'elles; vieux, comme jeune,\r\nenfant à tout âge, il bégayait ses sensations et ses besoins, comme\r\nun chien affamé, ou ennuyé de repos, demande à manger ou à se promener.\r\n\r\nLes mots, les langues, les lois, les sciences, les beaux-arts\r\nsont venus; et par eux enfin le diamant brut de notre esprit a été\r\npoli. On a dressé un homme, comme un animal; on est devenu auteur,\r\ncomme portefaix. Un géomètre a appris à faire les démonstrations\r\net les calculs les plus difficiles, comme un singe à ôter ou mettre\r\nson petit chapeau, et à monter sur son chien docile. Tout s'est fait\r\npar les signes; chaque espèce a compris ce qu'elle a pu comprendre:\r\net c'est de cette manière que les hommes ont acquis la connaissance\r\nsymbolique, ainsi nommée encore par nos philosophes d'Allemagne.\r\n\r\nRien de si simple, comme on voit, que la mécanique de notre\r\néducation! Tout se réduit à des sons, ou à des mots, qui de la bouche\r\nde l'un passent par l'oreille de l'autre dans le cerveau, qui reçoit\r\nen même temps par les yeux la figure des corps, dont ces mots sont\r\nles signes arbitraires.\r\n\r\nMais qui a parlé le premier? Qui a été le premier précepteur du\r\ngenre human? Qui a inventé les moyens de mettre à profit la docilité\r\nde notre organisation? Je n'en sais rien; le nom de ces heureux et\r\npremiers génies a été perdu dans la nuit des temps. Mais l'art est\r\nle fils de la nature; elle a dû longtemps le précéder.\r\n\r\nOn doit croire que les hommes les mieux organisés, ceux pour qui la\r\nnature aura épuisé ses bienfaits, auront instruit les autres. Ils\r\nn'auront pu entendre un bruit nouveau, par exemple, éprouver de\r\nnouvelles sensations, être frappé de tous ces beaux objets divers\r\nqui forment le ravissant spectacle de la nature, sans se trouver\r\ndans le cas de ce sourd de Chartres dont le grand Fontenelle nous\r\na le premier donné l'histoire, lorsqu'il entendit pour la première\r\nfois à quarante ans le bruit étonnant des cloches.\r\n\r\nDe là serait-il absurde de croire que ces premiers mortels essayèrent\r\nà la manière de ce sourd, ou à celle des animaux et des muets\r\n(autre espèce d'animaux), d'exprimer leurs nouveaux sentiments\r\npar des mouvements dépendants de l'économie de leur imagination,\r\net conséquemment ensuite par des sons spontanés propres à chaque\r\nanimal, expression naturelle de leur surprise, de leur joie, de leurs\r\ntransports, ou de leurs besoins? Car sans doute ceux que la nature\r\na doués d'un sentiment plus exquis, ont eu aussi plus de facilité\r\npour l'exprimer.\r\n\r\nVoilà comme je conçois que les hommes ont employé leur sentiment,\r\nou leur instinct, pour avoir de l'esprit, et enfin leur esprit, pour\r\navoir des connaissances. Voilà par quels moyens, autant que je puis\r\nles saisir, on s'est rempli le cerveau des idées, pour le réception\r\ndesquelles la nature l'avait formé. On s'est aidé l'un par l'autre;\r\net les plus petits commencements s'agrandissant peu à peu, toutes les\r\nchoses de l'univers ont été aussi facilement distinguées qu'un cercle.\r\n\r\nComme une corde de violon ou une touche de clavecin frémit et rend\r\nun son, les cordes du cerveau, frappées par les rayons sonores, ont\r\nété excitées à rendre ou à redire les mots qui les touchaient. Mais\r\ncomme telle est la construction de ce viscère, que dès qu'une fois\r\nles yeux bien formés pour l'optique ont reçu la peinture des objets,\r\nle cerveau ne peut pas ne pas voir leurs images et leurs différences:\r\nde même, lorsque les signes de ces différences ont été marqués, ou\r\ngravés dans le cerveau, l'âme en a nécessairement examiné les rapports;\r\nexamen qui lui était impossible sans la découverte des signes, ou\r\nl'invention des langues. Dans ces temps, où l'univers était presque\r\nmuet, l'âme était à l'égard de tous les objets, comme un homme qui,\r\nsans avoir aucune idée des proportions, regarderait un tableau, ou\r\nune pièce de sculpture: il n'y pourrait rien distinguer; ou comme\r\nun petit enfant (car alors l'âme était dans son enfance) qui, tenant\r\ndans sa main un certain nombre de petits brins de paille ou de bois,\r\nles voit en général d'une vue vague et superficielle, sans pouvoir les\r\ncompter ni les distinguer. Mais qu'on mette une espèce de pavillon,\r\nou d'étendard, à cette pièce de bois, par exemple, qu'on appelle mât,\r\nqu'on en mette un autre à un autre pareil corps; que le premier venu\r\nse nombre par le signe 1 et le second par le signe ou chiffre 2; alors\r\ncet enfant pourra les compter, et ainsi de suite il apprendra toute\r\nl'arithmétique. Dès qu'une figure lui paraîtra égale à une autre par\r\nson signe numératif, il conclûra sans peine que ce sont deux corps\r\ndifférents; que 1 et 1 font deux, que 2 et 2 font 4, [5] etc.\r\n\r\nC'est cette similitude réelle, ou apparente, des figures, qui est la\r\nbase fondamentale de toutes les vérités et de toutes nos connaissances,\r\nparmi lesquelles il est évident que celles dont les signes sont moins\r\nsimples et moins sensibles sont plus difficiles à apprendre que les\r\nautres, en ce qu'elles demandent plus de génie pour embrasser et\r\ncombiner cette immense quantité de mots par lesquels les sciences\r\ndont je parle expriment les vérités de leur ressort: tandis que les\r\nsciences qui s'annoncent par des chiffres, ou autres petits signes,\r\ns'apprennent facilement; et c'est sans doute cette facilité qui a\r\nfait la fortune des calculs algébriques, plus encore que leur évidence.\r\n\r\nTout ce savoir dont le vent enfle le ballon du cerveau de nos pédants\r\norgueilleux, n'est donc qu'un vaste amas de mots et de figures,\r\nqui forment dans la tête toutes les traces par lesquelles nous\r\ndistinguons et nous nous rappellons les objets. Toutes nos idées se\r\nréveillent, comme un jardinier qui connaît les plantes se souvient\r\nde toutes leurs phases à leur aspect. Ces mots et ces figures qui\r\nsont désignés par eux, sont tellements liés ensemble dans le cerveau,\r\nqu'il est assez rare qu'on imagine une chose sans le nom ou le signe\r\nqui lui est attaché.\r\n\r\nJe me sers toujours du mot imaginer, parceque je crois que tout\r\ns'imagine, et que toutes les parties de l'âme peuvent être justement\r\nréduites à la seule imagination, qui les forme toutes; et qu'ainsi\r\nle jugement, le raisonnement, la mémoire ne sont que des parties de\r\nl'âme nullement absolues, mais de véritables modifications de cette\r\nespèce de toile médullaire, sur laquelle les objets peints dans l'oeil\r\nsont renvoyés, comme d'une lanterne magique.\r\n\r\nMais si tel est ce merveilleux et incompréhensible résultat de\r\nl'organisation du cerveau; si tout se conçoit par l'imagination,\r\nsi tout s'explique par elle; pourquoi diviser le principe sensitif\r\nqui pense dans l'homme? N'est-ce pas une contradiction manifeste\r\ndans les partisans de la simplicité de l'esprit? Car une chose\r\nqu'on divise ne peut plus être, sans absurdité, regardée comme\r\nindivisible. Voilà où conduit l'abus des langues, et l'usage de ces\r\ngrands mots, spiritualité, immatérialité, etc., placés à tout hasard,\r\nsans être entendus, même par des gens d'esprit.\r\n\r\nRien de plus facile que de prouver un système, fondé comme\r\ncelui-ci sur le sentiment intime et l'expérience propre de chaque\r\nindividu. L'imagination, ou cette partie fantastique du cerveau, dont\r\nla nature nous est aussi inconnue que sa manière d'agir, est-elle\r\nnaturellement petite, ou faible? elle aura à peine la force de\r\ncomparer l'analogie, ou la ressemblance de ses idées; elle ne pourra\r\nvoir que ce qui sera vis-à-vis d'elle, ou ce qui l'affectera le plus\r\nvivement; et encore de quelle manière! Mais toujours est-il vrai\r\nque l'imagination seule aperçoit; que c'est elle qui se représente\r\ntous les objets, avec les mots et les figures qui les caractérisent;\r\net qu'ainsi c'est elle encore une fois qui est l'âme, puisqu'elle\r\nen fait tous les rôles. Par elle, par son pinceau flatteur, le froid\r\nsquelette de la raison prend des chairs vives et vermeilles; par elle\r\nles sciences fleurissent, les arts s'embellissent, les bois parlent,\r\nles échos soupirent, les rochers pleurent, le marbre respire, tout\r\nprend vie parmi les corps inanimés. C'est elle encore qui ajoute à\r\nla tendresse d'un coeur amoureux le piquant attrait de la volupté;\r\nelle la fait germer dans le cabinet du philosophe, et du pédant\r\npoudreux; elle forme enfin les savants comme les orateurs et les\r\npoëtes. Sottement décriée par les uns, vainement distinguée par les\r\nautres, qui tous l'ont mal connue, elle ne marche pas seulement à\r\nla suite des Grâces et des beaux-art, elle ne peint pas seulement\r\nla nature, elle peut aussi la mesurer. Elle raisonne, juge, pénètre,\r\ncompare, approfondit. Pourrait-elle si bien sentir les beautées des\r\ntableaux qui lui sont tracés, sans en découvrir les rapports? Non;\r\ncomme elle ne peut se replier sur les plaisirs des sens, sans en\r\ngoûter toute la perfection ou la volupté, elle ne peut réfléchir sur\r\nce qu'elle a mécaniquement conçu, sans être alors le jugement même.\r\n\r\nPlus on exerce l'imagination, ou le plus maigre génie, plus il prend,\r\npour ainsi dire, d'embonpoint; plus il s'agrandit, devient nerveux,\r\nrobuste, vaste et capable de penser. La meilleure organisation a\r\nbesoin de cet exercice.\r\n\r\nL'organisation est le premier mérite de l'homme; c'est en vain que\r\ntous les auteurs de morale ne mettent point au rang des qualités\r\nestimables celles qu'on tient de la nature, mais seulement les\r\ntalents qui s'acquièrent à force de réflexions et d'industrie: car\r\nd'où nous vient, je vous prie, l'habileté, la science et la vertu, si\r\nce n'est d'une disposition qui nous rend propres à devenir habiles,\r\nsavants et vertueux? Et d'où nous vient encore cette disposition,\r\nsi ce n'est de la nature? Nous n'avons de qualités estimables que\r\npar elle; nous lui devons tout ce que nous sommes. Pourquoi donc\r\nn'estimerais-je pas autant ceux qui ont des qualités naturelles, que\r\nceux qui brillent par des vertus acquises, et comme d'emprunt? Quel\r\nque soit le mérite, de quelque endroit qu'il naisse, il est digne\r\nd'estime; il ne s'agit que de savoir le mesurer. L'esprit, la beauté,\r\nles richesses, la noblesse, quoiqu'enfants du hasard, ont tous leur\r\nprix, comme l'adresse, le savoir, la vertu, etc. Ceux que la nature\r\na comblés de ses dons les plus précieux, doivent plaindre ceux à qui\r\nils ont été refusés; mais ils peuvent sentir leur supériorité sans\r\norgueil, et en connaisseurs. Une belle femme serait aussi ridicule\r\nde se trouver laide, qu'un homme d'esprit de se croire un sot. Une\r\nmodestie outrée (défaut rare à la vérité) est une sorte d'ingratitude\r\nenvers la nature. Une honnête fierté, au contraire, est la marque\r\nd'une âme belle et grande, que décèlent des traits mâles moulés comme\r\npar le sentiment.\r\n\r\nSi l'organisation est un mérite, et le premier mérite, et la source\r\nde tous les autres, l'instruction est le second. Le cerveau le mieux\r\nconstruit, sans elle, le serait en pure perte; comme sans l'usage du\r\nmonde, l'homme le mieux fait ne serait qu'un paysan grossier. Mais\r\naussi quel serait le fruit de la plus excellente école, sans une\r\nmatrice parfaitement ouverte à l'entrée ou à la conception des\r\nidées? Il est aussi impossible de donner une seule idée à un homme\r\nprivé de tous les sens, que de faire un enfant à une femme à laquelle\r\nla nature aurait poussé la distraction jusqu'à oublier de faire une\r\nvulve, comme je l'ai vu dans une, qui n'avait ni fente, ni vagin,\r\nni matrice, et qui pour cette raison fut démariée après dix ans\r\nde mariage.\r\n\r\nMais si le cerveau est à la fois bien organisé et bien instruit, c'est\r\nune terre féconde parfaitement ensemencée, qui produit le centuple de\r\nce qu'elle a reçu: ou (pour quitter le style figuré souvent nécessaire,\r\npour mieux exprimer ce qu'on sent et donner des grâces à la Vérité\r\nmême), l'imagination élevée par l'art à la belle et rare dignité de\r\ngénie, saisit exactement tous les rapports des idées qu'elle a conçues,\r\nembrasse avec facilité une foule étonnante d'objets, pour en tirer\r\nenfin une longue chaîne de conséquences, lesquelles ne sont encore\r\nque de nouveaux rapports, enfantés par la comparaison des premiers,\r\nauxquels l'âme trouve une parfaite ressemblance. Telle est, selon moi,\r\nla génération de l'esprit. Je dis trouve, comme j'ai donné ci-devant\r\nl'épithète d'apparente à la similitude des objets: non que je pense\r\nque nos sens soient toujours trompeurs, comme l'a prétendu le Père\r\nMalebranche, ou que nos yeux naturellement un peu ivres ne voient pas\r\nles objets tels qu'ils sont en eux mêmes, quoique les microscopes\r\nnous le prouvent tous les jours, mais pour n'avoir aucune dispute\r\navec les Pyrrhoniens, parmi lesquels Bayle s'est distingué.\r\n\r\nJe dis de la vérité en général ce que Mr. de Fontenelle dit de\r\ncertaines en particulier, qu'il faut la sacrifier aux agréments de\r\nla société. Il est de la douceur de mon caractère d'obvier à toute\r\ndispute, lorsqu'il ne s'agit pas d'aiguiser la conversation. Les\r\nCartésiens viendraient ici vainement à la charge avec leur idées\r\ninnées; je ne me donnerais certainement pas le quart de la peine qu'a\r\nprise Mr. Locke pour attaquer de telles chimères. Quelle utilité,\r\nen effet, de faire un gros livre, pour prouver une doctrine qui était\r\nérigée en axiome il y a trois mille ans?\r\n\r\nSuivant les principes que nous avons posés, et que nous croyons vrais,\r\ncelui qui a le plus d'imagination doit être regardé comme ayant le\r\nplus d'esprit, ou de génie, car tous ces mots sont synonymes; et\r\nencore une fois c'est par un abus honteux qu'on croit dire des choses\r\ndifférentes, lorsqu'on ne dit que différents mots ou différents sons,\r\nauxquels on n'a attaché aucune idée ou distinction réelle.\r\n\r\nLa plus belle, la plus grande, ou la plus forte imagination, est donc\r\nla plus propre aux sciences, comme aux arts. Je ne décide point s'il\r\nfaut plus d'esprit pour exceller dans l'art des Aristotes, ou des\r\nDescartes, que dans celui des Euripides ou des Sophocles; et si la\r\nnature s'est mise en plus grands frais pour faire Newton que pour\r\nformer Corneille (ce dont je doute fort), mais il est certain que\r\nc'est la seule imagination diversement appliquée qui a fait leur\r\ndifférent triomphe et leur gloire immortelle.\r\n\r\nSi quelqu'un passe pour avoir peu de jugement, avec beaucoup\r\nd'imagination; cela veut dire que l'imagination trop abandonnée à elle\r\nmême, presque toujours comme occupée à se regarder dans le miroir de\r\nses sensations, n'a pas assez contracté l'habitude de les examiner\r\nelles-mêmes avec attention; plus profondément pénétrée des traces,\r\nou des images, que de leur vérité ou de leur ressemblance.\r\n\r\nIl est vrai que telle est la vivacité des ressorts de l'imagination,\r\nque si l'attention, cette clé ou mère des sciences, ne s'en mêle,\r\nil ne lui est guères permis que de parcourir et d'effleurer les objets.\r\n\r\nVoyez cet oiseau sur la branche, il semble toujours prêt à s'envoler;\r\nl'imagination est de même. Toujours emportée par le tourbillon du\r\nsang et des esprits, une onde fait une trace, effacée par celle qui\r\nsuit; l'âme court après, souvent en vain: il faut qu'elle s'attende\r\nà regretter ce qu'elle n'a pas assez vite saisi et fixé: et c'est\r\nainsi que l'imagination, véritable image du temps, se détruit et se\r\nrenouvelle sans cesse.\r\n\r\nTel est le chaos et la succession continuelle et rapide de nos\r\nidées; elles se chassent, comme un flot pousse l'autre; de sorte\r\nque si l'imagination n'emploie, pour ainsi dire, une partie de ses\r\nmuscles pour être comme en équilibre sur les cordes du cerveau, pour\r\nse soutenir quelque temps sur un objet qui va fuir et s'empêcher de\r\ntomber sur un autre, qu'il n'est pas encore temps de contempler, jamais\r\nelle ne sera digne du beau nom de jugement. Elle exprimera vivement ce\r\nqu'elle aura senti de même; elle formera des orateurs, des musiciens,\r\ndes peintres, des poètes, et jamais un seul philosophe. Au contraire\r\nsi, dès l'enfance, on accoutume l'imagination à se brider elle-même,\r\nà ne point se laisser emporter à sa propre impétuosité, qui ne fait\r\nque de brillants enthousiastes, à arrêter, contenir ses idées, à les\r\nretourner dans tous les sens, pour voir toutes les faces d'un objet,\r\nalors l'imagination prompte à juger embrassera par le raisonnement\r\nla plus grande sphère d'objets, et sa vivacité, toujours de si bon\r\naugure dans les enfants, et qu'il ne s'agit que de régler par l'étude\r\net l'exercice, ne sera plus qu'une pénétration clairvoyante, sans\r\nlaquelle on fait peu de progrès dans les sciences.\r\n\r\nTels sont les simples fondements sur lesquels a été bati l'édifice\r\nde la logique. La nature les avait jetés pour tout le genre humain;\r\nmais les uns en ont profité, les autres en ont abusé.\r\n\r\nMalgré toutes ces prérogatives de l'homme sur les animaux, c'est lui\r\nfaire honneur que de le ranger dans la même classe. Il est vrai que,\r\njusqu'à un certain âge, il est plus animal qu'eux, parce qu'il apporte\r\nmoins d'instinct en naissant.\r\n\r\nQuel est l'animal qui mourrait de faim au milieu d'une rivière de\r\nlait? L'homme seul. Semblable à ce vieux enfant dont un moderne\r\nparle d'après Arnobe, il ne connait ni les aliments qui lui sont\r\npropres, ni l'eau qui peut le noyer, ni le feu qui peut le réduire\r\nen poudre. Faites briller pour la première fois la lumière d'une\r\nbougie aux yeux d'un enfant, il y portera machinalement le doigt,\r\ncomme pour savoir quel est le nouveau phénomène qu'il aperçoit; c'est\r\nà ses dépens qu'il en connaîtra le danger, mais il n'y sera pas repris.\r\n\r\nMettez-le encore avec un animal sur le bord d'un précipice! lui seul\r\ny tombera; il se noie, où l'autre se sauve à la nage. A quatorze ou\r\nquinze ans, il entrevoit à peine les grands plaisirs qui l'attendent\r\ndans la reproduction de son espèce; déjà adolescent, il ne sait pas\r\ntrop comment s'y prendre dans un jeu que la nature apprend si vite aux\r\nanimaux: il se cache, comme s'il était honteux d'avoir du plaisir et\r\nd'être fait pour être heureux, tandis que les animaux se font gloire\r\nd'être cyniques. Sans éducation, ils sont sans préjugés. Mais voyons\r\nencore ce chien et cet enfant qui ont tous deux perdu leur maître dans\r\nun grand chemin: l'enfant pleure, il ne sait à quel saint se vouer;\r\nle chien, mieux servi par son odorat que l'autre par sa raison,\r\nl'aura bientôt trouvé.\r\n\r\nLa nature nous avait donc faits pour être au dessous des animaux, ou du\r\nmoins pour faire par là même mieux éclater les prodiges de l'éducation,\r\nqui seule nous tire du niveau et nous élève enfin au-dessus d'eux. Mais\r\naccordera-t-on la même distinction aux sourds, aux aveugles-nés,\r\naux imbéciles, aux fous, aux hommes sauvages, ou qui ont été élevés\r\ndans les bois avec les bêtes, à ceux dont l'affection hypocondriaque\r\na perdu l'imagination, enfin à toutes ces bêtes à figure humaine,\r\nqui ne montrent que l'instinct le plus grossier? Non, tous ces hommes\r\nde corps, et non d'esprit, ne méritent pas une classe particulière.\r\n\r\nNous n'avons pas dessein de nous dissimuler les objections qu'on peut\r\nfaire en faveur de la distinction primitive de l'homme et des animaux,\r\ncontre notre sentiment. Il y a, dit-on, dans l'homme une loi naturelle,\r\nune connaissance du bien et du mal, qui n'a pas été gravée dans le\r\ncoeur des animaux.\r\n\r\nMais cette objection, ou plutôt cette assertion est-elle fondée sur\r\nl'expérience, sans laquelle un philosophe peut tout rejeter? En\r\navons-nous quelqu'une qui nous convainque que l'homme seul a été\r\néclairé d'un rayon refusé à tous les autres animaux? S'il n'y en a\r\npoint, nous ne pouvons pas plus connaître par elle ce qui se passe\r\ndans eux, et même dans les hommes, que ne pas sentir ce qui affecte\r\nl'intérieur de notre être. Nous savons que nous pensons et que nous\r\navons des remords: un sentiment intime ne nous force que trop d'en\r\nconvenir; mais pour juger des remords d'autrui, ce sentiment qui est\r\ndans nous est insuffisant: c'est pourquoi il en faut croire les autres\r\nhommes sur leur parole, ou sur les signes sensibles et extérieurs\r\nque nous avons remarqués en nous-mêmes, lorsque nous éprouvions la\r\nmême conscience et les mêmes tourments.\r\n\r\nMais pour décider si les animaux qui ne parlent point ont reçu\r\nla loi naturelle, il faut s'en rapporter conséquemment à ces\r\nsignes dont je viens de parler, supposé qu'ils existent. Les faits\r\nsemblent le prouver. Le chien qui a mordu son maître qui l'agaçait,\r\na paru s'en repentir le moment suivant; on l'a vu triste, fâché,\r\nn'osant se montrer, et s'avouer coupable par un air rampant et\r\nhumilié. L'histoire nous offre un exemple célèbre d'un lion qui ne\r\nvoulut pas déchirer un homme abandonné à sa fureur, parce qu'il le\r\nreconnut pour son bienfaiteur. Qu'il serait à souhaiter que l'homme\r\nmême montrât toujours la même reconnaissance pour les bienfaits et le\r\nmême respect pour l'humanité! On n'aurait plus à craindre les ingrats,\r\nni ces guerres qui sont le fléau du genre humain et les vrais bourreaux\r\nde la loi naturelle.\r\n\r\nMais un être à qui la nature a donné un instinct si précoce, si\r\néclairé, qui juge, combine, raisonne et délibère, autant que s'étend\r\net le lui permet la sphère de son activité; un être qui s'attache\r\npar les bienfaits, qui se détache par les mauvais traitements et\r\nva essayer un meilleur maître; un être d'une structure semblable à\r\nla nôtre, qui fait les mêmes opérations, qui a les mêmes passions,\r\nles mêmes douleurs, les mêmes plaisirs, plus ou moins vifs suivant\r\nl'empire de l'imagination et la délicatesse des nerfs; un tel être\r\nenfin ne montre-t-il pas clairement qu'il sent ses torts et les\r\nnôtres, qu'il connait le bien et le mal et, en un mot, a conscience\r\nde ce qu'il fait? Son âme qui marque comme la nôtre les mêmes joies,\r\nles mêmes mortifications, les mêmes déconcertements, serait-elle\r\nsans aucune répugnance à la vue de son semblable déchiré, ou après\r\nl'avoir lui-même impitoyablement mis en pièces? Cela posé, le don\r\nprécieux dont il s'agit n'aurait point été refusé aux animaux; car\r\npuisqu'ils nous offrent des signes évidents de leur repentir, comme\r\nde leur intelligence, qu'y a-t-il d'absurde à penser que des êtres,\r\ndes machines presque aussi parfaites que nous, soient, comme nous,\r\nfaites pour penser et pour sentir la nature?\r\n\r\nQu'on ne m'objecte point que les animaux sont pour la plupart des êtres\r\nféroces, qui ne sont pas capables de sentir les maux qu'ils font; car\r\ntous les hommes distinguent-ils mieux les vices et les vertus? Il est\r\ndans notre espèce de la férocité, comme dans la leur. Les hommes qui\r\nsont dans la barbare habitude d'enfreindre la loi naturelle, n'en sont\r\npas si tourmentés que ceux qui la transgressent pour la première fois,\r\net que la force de l'exemple n'a point endurcis. Il en est de même des\r\nanimaux, comme des hommes. Les uns et les autres peuvent être plus\r\nou moins féroces par tempérament, et ils le deviennent encore plus\r\navec ceux qui le sont. Mais un animal doux, pacifique, qui vit avec\r\nd'autres animaux semblables, et d'aliments doux, sera ennemi du sang\r\net du carnage, il rougira intérieurement de l'avoir versé; avec cette\r\ndifférence peut-être que, comme chez eux tout est immolé aux besoins,\r\naux plaisirs et aux commodités de la vie, dont ils jouissent plus\r\nque nous, leurs remords ne semblent pas devoir être si vifs que les\r\nnôtres, parceque nous ne sommes pas dans la même nécessité qu'eux. La\r\ncoutume émousse et peut-être étouffe les remords, comme les plaisirs.\r\n\r\nMais je veux pour un moment supposer que je me trompe, et qu'il n'est\r\npas juste que presque tout l'univers ait tort à ce sujet, tandis\r\nque j'aurais seul raison; j'accorde que les animaux, même les plus\r\nexcellents, ne connaissent pas la distinction du bien et du mal moral,\r\nqu'ils n'ont aucune mémoire des attentions qu'on a eues pour eux,\r\ndu bien qu'on leur a fait, aucun sentiment de leurs propres vertus;\r\nque ce lion, par exemple, dont j'ai parlé après tant d'autres, ne se\r\nsouvienne pas de n'avoir pas voulu ravir la vie à cet homme qui fut\r\nlivré à sa furie, dans un spectacle plus inhumain que tous les lions,\r\nles tigres et les ours; tandis que nos compatriotes se battent, Suisses\r\ncontre Suisses, frères contre frères, se reconnaissent, s'enchaînent,\r\nou se tuent sans remords, parce qu'un prince paie leurs meurtres: je\r\nsuppose enfin que la loi naturelle n'ait pas été donnée aux animaux,\r\nquelles en seront les conséquences? L'homme n'est pas pétri d'un limon\r\nplus précieux; la nature n'a employé qu'une seule et même pâte, dont\r\nelle a seulement varié les levains. Si donc l'animal ne se repent\r\npas d'avoir violé le sentiment intérieur dont je parle, ou plutôt\r\ns'il en est absolument privé, il faut nécessairement que l'homme\r\nsoit dans le même cas: moyennant quoi adieu la loi naturelle et tous\r\nces beaux traités qu'on a publiés sur elle! Tout le règne animal en\r\nserait généralement dépourvû. Mais réciproquement si l'homme ne peut\r\nse dispenser de convenir qu'il distingue toujours, lorsque la santé le\r\nlaisse jouïr de lui-même, ceux qui ont de la probité, de l'humanité,\r\nde la vertu, de ceux qui ne sont ni humains, ni vertueux, ni honnêtes\r\ngens; qu'il est facile de distinguer ce qui est vice, ou vertu, par\r\nl'unique plaisir ou la propre répugnance qui en sont comme les effets\r\nnaturels, il s'ensuit que les animaux formés de la même matière,\r\nà laquelle il n'a peut-être manqué qu'un degré de fermentation pour\r\négaler les hommes en tout, doivent participer aux mêmes prérogatives\r\nde l'animalité, et qu'ainsi il n'est point d'âme, ou de substance\r\nsensitive, sans remords. La réflexion suivante va fortifier celles-ci.\r\n\r\nOn ne peut détruire la loi naturelle. L'empreinte en est si forte dans\r\ntous les animaux, que je ne doute nullement que les plus sauvages\r\net les plus féroces n'aient quelques moments de repentir. Je crois\r\nque la fille sauvage de Châlons en Champagne aura porté la peine de\r\nson crime, s'il est vrai qu'elle ait mangé sa soeur. Je pense la même\r\nchose de tous ceux qui commettent des crimes, même involontaires, ou de\r\ntempérament: de Gaston d'Orléans qui ne pouvait s'empêcher de voler;\r\nde certaine femme qui fut sujette au même vice dans la grossesse, et\r\ndont ses enfants héritèrent; de celle qui dans le même état, mangea son\r\nmari; de cette autre qui égorgeait les enfants, salait leurs corps,\r\net en mangeait tous les jours comme du petit salé; de cette fille\r\nde voleur anthropophage, qui la devint à 12 ans, quoiqu'ayant perdu\r\npère et mère à l'âge d'un an elle eût été élevée par d'honnêtes gens,\r\npour ne rien dire de tant d'autres exemples dont nos observateurs\r\nsont remplis, et qui prouvent tous qu'il est mille vices et vertus\r\nhéréditaires, qui passent des parents aux enfants, comme ceux de la\r\nnourrice à ceux qu'elle allaite. Je dis donc et j'accorde que ces\r\nmalheureux ne sentent pas pour la plupart sur le champ l'énormité\r\nde leur action. La boulimie, par exemple, ou la faim canine, peut\r\néteindre tout sentiment; c'est une manie d'estomac qu'on est forcé\r\nde satisfaire. Mais revenues à elles-mêmes, et comme désenivrées,\r\nquels remords pour ces femmes qui se rappellent le meurtre qu'elles\r\nont commis dans ce qu'elles avaient de plus cher! quelle punition d'un\r\nmal involontaire, auquel elles n'ont pu résister, dont elles n'ont eu\r\naucune conscience! Cependant ce n'est point assez apparemment pour les\r\njuges. Parmi les femmes dont je parle, l'une fut rouée, et brûlée,\r\nl'autre enterrée vive. Je sens tout ce que demande l'intérêt de la\r\nsociété. Mais il serait sans doute à souhaiter qu'il n'y eût pour\r\njuges que d'excellents médecins. Eux seuls pourraient distinguer le\r\ncriminel innocent, du coupable. Si la raison est esclave d'un sens\r\ndépravé, ou en fureur, comment peut-elle le gouverner?\r\n\r\nMais si le crime porte avec soi sa propre punition plus ou moins\r\ncruelle; si la plus longue et la plus barbare habitude ne peut\r\ntout-à-fait arracher le repentir des coeurs les plus inhumains;\r\ns'ils sont déchirés par la mémoire même de leurs actions; pour quoi\r\neffrayer l'imagination des esprits faibles par un enfer, par des\r\nspectres, et des précipices de feu, moins réels encore que ceux\r\nde Pascal [6]? Qu'est-il besoin de recourir à des fables, comme un\r\npape de bonne foi l'a dit lui-même, pour tourmenter les malheureux\r\nmêmes qu'on fait périr, parce qu'on ne les trouve pas assez punis\r\npar leur propre conscience, qui est leur premier bourreau? Ce n'est\r\npas que je veuille dire que tous les criminels soient injustement\r\npunis; je prétends seulement que ceux dont la volonté est dépravée,\r\net la conscience éteinte, le sont assez par leurs remords, quand ils\r\nreviennent à eux-mêmes; remords, j'ose encore le dire, dont la nature\r\naurait dû en ce cas, ce me semble, délivrer des malheureux entraînés\r\npar une fatale nécessité.\r\n\r\nLes criminels, les méchants, les ingrats, ceux enfin que ne sentent\r\npas la nature, tyrans malheureux et indignes du jour, ont beau se\r\nfaire un cruel plaisir de leur barbarie, il est des moments calmes et\r\nde réflexion, où la conscience vengeresse s'élève, dépose contr'eux,\r\net les condamne à être presque sans cesse déchirés de ses propres\r\nmains. Qui tourmente les hommes, est tourmenté par lui-même; et les\r\nmaux qu'il sentira seront la juste mesure de ceux qu'il aura faits.\r\n\r\nD'un autre côté, il y a tant de plaisir à faire du bien, à sentir,\r\nà reconnaître celui qu'on reçoit, tant de contentement à pratiquer\r\nla vertu, à être doux, humain, tendre, charitable, compatissant et\r\ngénéreux (ce seul mot renferme toutes les vertus), que je tiens pour\r\nassez puni quiconque a le malheur de n'être pas né vertueux.\r\n\r\nNous n'avons pas originairement été faits pour être savants;\r\nc'est peut-être par une espèce d'abus de nos facultés organiques,\r\nque nous le sommes devenus; et cela à la charge de l'Etat, qui\r\nnourrit une multitude de fainéants, que la vanité a decorés du nom\r\nde philosophes. La nature nous a tous créés uniquement pour être\r\nheureux; oui, tous, depuis le ver qui rampe, jusqu'à l'aigle qui\r\nse perd dans la nue. C'est pourquoi elle a donné à tous les animaux\r\nquelque portion de la loi naturelle, portion plus ou moins exquise\r\nselon que le comportent les organes bien conditionnés de chaque animal.\r\n\r\nA présent, comment définirons-nous la loi naturelle? C'est un sentiment\r\nqui nous apprend ce que nous ne devons pas faire, parce que nous ne\r\nvoudrions pas qu'on nous le fît. Oserais-je ajouter à cette idée\r\ncommune, qu'il me semble que ce sentiment n'est qu'une espèce de\r\ncrainte, ou de frayeur, aussi salutaire à l'espèce qu'a l'individu;\r\ncar peut-être ne respectons-nous la bourse et la vie des autres, que\r\npour nous conserver nos biens, notre honneur et nous-mêmes; semblables\r\nà ces Ixions du Christianisme qui n'aiment Dieu et n'embrassent tant\r\nde chimériques vertus, que parce qu'ils craignent l'enfer.\r\n\r\nVous voyez que la loi naturelle n'est qu'un sentiment intime,\r\nqui appartient encore à l'imagination, comme tous les autres,\r\nparmi lesquels on compte la pensée. Par conséquent elle ne suppose\r\névidemment ni éducation, ni révélation, ni législateur, à moins qu'on\r\nne veuille la confondre avec les lois civiles, à la manière ridicule\r\ndes théologiens.\r\n\r\nLes armes du fanatisme peuvent détruire ceux qui soutiennent ces\r\nvérités; mais elles ne détruiront jamais ces vérités mêmes.\r\n\r\nCe n'est pas que je révoque en doute l'existence d'un Etre suprême; il\r\nme semble au contraire que le plus grand degré de probabilité est pour\r\nelle: mais comme cette existence ne prouve pas plus la nécessité d'un\r\nculte, que toute autre, c'est une vérité théorique, qui n'est guère\r\nd'usage dans la pratique: de sorte que, comme on peut dire, d'après\r\ntant d'expériences, que la religion ne suppose pas l'exacte probité,\r\nles mêmes raisons autorisent à penser que l'athéisme ne l'exclut pas.\r\n\r\nQui sait d'ailleurs si la raison de l'existence de l'homme ne serait\r\npas dans son existence même? Peut-être a-t-il été jeté au hasard\r\nsur un point de la surface de la terre, sans qu'on puisse savoir ni\r\ncomment, ni pourquoi, mais seulement qu'il doit vivre et mourir,\r\nsemblable à ces champignons, qui paraissent d'un jour à l'autre,\r\nou à ces fleurs qui bordent les fossés et couvrent les murailles.\r\n\r\nNe nous perdons point dans l'infini, nous ne sommes pas faits pour en\r\navoir la moindre idée; il nous est absolument impossible de remonter\r\nà l'origine des choses. Il est égal d'ailleurs pour notre repos,\r\nque la matière soit éternelle, ou qu'elle ait été créée, qu'il y ait\r\nun Dieu, ou qu'il n'y en ait pas. Quelle folie de tant se tourmenter\r\npour ce qu'il est impossible de connaître, et ce qui ne nous rendrait\r\npas plus heureux, quand nous en viendrions à bout.\r\n\r\nMais, dit-on, lisez tous les ouvrages des Fénelon, des Nieuventit, des\r\nAbadie, des Derham, des Raï, etc. Eh bien! que m'apprendront-ils? ou\r\nplutôt que m'ont-ils appris? Ce ne sont que d'ennuyeuses répétitions\r\nd'écrivains zélés, dont l'un n'ajoute à l'autre qu'un verbiage,\r\nplus propres à fortifier qu'à saper les fondements de l'athéisme. Le\r\nvolume des preuves qu'on tire du spectacle de la nature, ne leur donne\r\npas plus de force. La structure seule d'un doigt, d'une oreille,\r\nd'un oeil, une observation de Malpighi, prouve tout, et sans doute\r\nbeaucoup mieux que Descartes et Malebranche; ou tout le reste ne prouve\r\nrien. Les déistes, et les Chrétiens mêmes devraient donc se contenter\r\nde faire observer que, dans tout le règne animal, les mêmes vues sont\r\nexécutées par une infinité de divers moyens, tous cependant exactement\r\ngéométriques. Car de quelles plus fortes armes pourrait-on terrasser\r\nles athées? Il est vrai que si ma raison ne me trompe pas, l'homme et\r\ntout l'univers semblent avoir été destinés à cette unité de vues. Le\r\nsoleil, l'air, l'eau, l'organisation, la forme des corps, tout est\r\narrangé dans l'oeil, comme dans un miroir qui présente fidèlement à\r\nl'imagination les objets qui y sont peints, suivant les lois qu'exige\r\ncette infinie variété de corps qui servent à la vision. Dans l'oreille,\r\nnous trouvons partout une diversité frappante, sans que cette diverse\r\nfabrique de l'homme, des animaux, des oiseaux, des poissons, produise\r\ndifférents usages. Toutes les oreilles sont si mathématiquement\r\nfaites, qu'elles tendent également au seul et même but, qui est\r\nd'entendre. Le hasard, demande le déiste, serait-il donc assez grand\r\ngéomètre, pour varier ainsi à son gré les ouvrages dont on le suppose\r\nauteur, sans que tant de diversité pût l'empêcher d'atteindre la même\r\nfin? Il objecte encore ces parties évidemment contenues dans l'animal\r\npour de futurs usages, le papillon dans la chenille, l'homme dans\r\nle ver spermatique, un polype entier dans chacune de ses parties,\r\nla valvule du trou ovale, le poumon dans le foetus, les dents dans\r\nleurs alvéoles, les os dans les fluides, qui s'en détachent et se\r\ndurcissent d'une manière incompréhensible. Et comme les partisans\r\nde ce système, loin de rien négliger pour le faire valoir, ne se\r\nlassent jamais d'accumuler preuves sur preuves, ils veulent profiter\r\nde tout, et de la faiblesse même de l'esprit en certain cas. Voyez,\r\ndisent-ils, les Spinoza, les Vanini, les Desbarreaux, les Boindin,\r\napôtres qui font plus d'honneur que de tort au déisme! La durée de la\r\nsanté de ces derniers a été la mesure de leur incrédulité: et il est\r\nrare en effet, ajoutent-ils, qu'on n'abjure pas l'athéisme, dès que\r\nles passions se sont affaiblies avec le corps qui en est l'instrument.\r\n\r\nVoilà certainement tout ce qu'on peut dire de plus favorable à\r\nl'existence d'un Dieu, quoique le dernier argument soit frivole, en ce\r\nque ces conversions sont courtes, l'esprit reprenant presque toujours\r\nses anciennes opinions et se conduisant en conséquence, dès qu'il a\r\nrecouvré ou plutôt retrouvé ses forces dans celles du corps. En voilà\r\ndu moins beaucoup plus que n'en dit le médecin Diderot dans ses Pensées\r\nphilosophiques, sublime ouvrage qui ne convaincra pas un athée. Que\r\nrépondre en effet à un homme qui dit? \"Nous ne connaissons point\r\nla nature: des causes cachées dans son sein pourraient avoir tout\r\nproduit. Voyez à votre tour le polype de Trembley! ne contient-il\r\npas en soi les causes qui donnent lieu à sa régénération? quelle\r\nabsurdité y aurait-il donc à penser qu'il est des causes physiques\r\npour lesquelles tout a été fait, et auxquelles toute la chaîne de ce\r\nvaste univers est si nécessairement liée et assujettie, que rien de ce\r\nqui arrive ne pouvait pas ne pas arriver; des causes dont l'ignorance\r\nabsolument invincible nous a fait recourir à un Dieu, qui n'est pas\r\nmême un être de raison, suivant certains? Ainsi, détruire le hasard, ce\r\nn'est pas prouver l'existence d'un Etre supreme, puisqu'il peut y avoir\r\nautre chose qui ne serait ni hasard, ni Dieu, je veux dire la Nature,\r\ndont l'étude par conséquent ne peut faire que des incrédules, comme\r\nle prouve la façon de penser de tous ses plus heureux scrutateurs.\"\r\n\r\nLe poids de l'univers n'ébranle donc pas un véritable athée, loin\r\nde l'écraser; et tous ces indices mille et mille fois rebattus d'un\r\nCréateur, indices qu'on met fort au-dessus de la façon de penser\r\ndans nos semblables, ne sont évidents, quelque loin qu'on pousse cet\r\nargument, que pour les Antipyrrhoniens, ou pour ceux qui ont assez\r\nde confiance dans leur raison pour croire pouvoir juger sur certaines\r\napparences, auxquelles, comme vous voyez, les athées peuvent en opposer\r\nd'autres peut-être aussi fortes et absolument contraires. Car si\r\nnous écoutons encore les naturalistes, ils nous diront que les mêmes\r\ncauses qui dans les mains d'un chimiste et par le hasard de divers\r\nmélanges ont fait le premier miroir, dans celles de la nature ont\r\nfait l'eau pure, qui en sert à la simple bergère: que le mouvement\r\nqui conserve le monde, a pu le créer; que chaque corps a pris la\r\nplace que sa nature lui a assignée; que l'air a dû entourer la terre,\r\npar la même raison que le fer et les autres métaux sont l'ouvrage\r\nde ses entrailles; que le soleil est une production aussi naturelle,\r\nque celle de l'électricité; qu'il n'a pas plus été fait pour échauffer\r\nla terre et tous ses habitants, qu'il brûle quelquefois, que la pluie\r\npour faire pousser les grains, qu'elle gâte souvent; que le miroir et\r\nl'eau n'ont pas plus été faits pour qu'on pût s'y regarder, que tous\r\nles corps polis qui ont la même propriété: que l'oeil est à la vérité\r\nune espèce de trumeau dans lequel l'âme peut contempler l'image des\r\nobjets, tels qu'ils lui sont représentés par ces corps: mais qu'il\r\nn'est pas démontré que cet organe ait été réellement fait exprès\r\npour cette contemplation, ni exprès placé dans l'orbite; qu'enfin\r\nil se pourrait bien faire que Lucrèce, le médecin Lamy et tous les\r\nEpicuriens anciens et modernes eûssent raison, lorsqu'ils avancent que\r\nl'oeil ne voit que par ce qu'il se trouve organisé, et placé comme il\r\nl'est, que posées une fois les mêmes règles de mouvement que suit la\r\nnature dans la génération et le développement des corps, il n'était\r\npas possible que ce merveilleux organe fût organisé et placé autrement.\r\n\r\nTel est le pour et le contre, et l'abrégé des grandes raisons qui\r\npartageront éternellement les philosophes. Je ne prends aucun parti.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Non nostrum inter vos tantas componere lites.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nC'est ce que je disais à un Français de mes amis, aussi franc\r\nPyrrhonien que moi, homme de beaucoup de mérite, et digne d'un meilleur\r\nsort. Il me fit à ce sujet une réponse fort singulière. Il est vrai,\r\nme dit-il, que le pour et le contre ne doit point inquiéter l'âme d'un\r\nphilosophe, qui voit que rien n'est démontré avec assez de clarté\r\npour forcer son consentement, et même que les idées indicatives qui\r\ns'offrent d'un côté, sont ausitôt détruites par celles qui se montrent\r\nde l'autre. Cependant, reprit-il, l'univers ne sera jamais heureux,\r\nà moins qu'il ne soit athée. Voici quelles étaient les raisons de\r\ncet abominable homme. Si l'athéisme, disait-il, était généralement\r\nrépandu, toutes les branches de la religion seraient alors détruites et\r\ncoupées par la racine. Plus de guerres théologiques; plus de soldats\r\nde religion; soldats terribles! la nature infectée d'un poison sacré,\r\nreprendrait ses droits et sa pureté. Sourds à toute autre voix, les\r\nmortels tranquilles ne suivraient que les conseils spontanés de leur\r\npropre individu, les seuls qu'on ne méprise point impunément et qui\r\npeuvent seuls nous conduire au bonheur par les agréables sentiers de\r\nla vertu.\r\n\r\nTelle est la loi naturelle; quiconque en est rigide observateur,\r\nest honnête homme, et mérite la confiance de tout le genre\r\nhumain. Quiconque ne la suit pas scrupuleusement, a beau affecter les\r\nspécieux dehors d'une autre religion, est un fourbe, ou un hypocrite\r\ndont je me défie.\r\n\r\nAprès cela, qu'un vain peuple pense différemment; qu'il ose affirmer\r\nqu'il y va de la probité même, à ne pas croire la Révélation; qu'il\r\nfaut en un mot un autre religion que celle de la nature, quelle\r\nqu'elle soit! quelle misère! quelle pitié! et la bonne opinion que\r\nchacun nous donne de celle qu'il a embrassée! Nous ne briguons point\r\nici le suffrage du vulgaire. Qui dresse dans son coeur des autels à\r\nla superstition, est né pour adorer des idoles, et non pour sentir\r\nla vertu.\r\n\r\nMais puisque toutes les facultés de l'âme dépendent tellement de\r\nla propre organisation du cerveau et de tout le corps, qu'elles ne\r\nsont visiblement que cette organisation même: voilà une machine bien\r\néclairée! car enfin quand l'homme seul aurait reçu en partage la\r\nloi naturelle, en serait-il moins une machine? Des roues, quelques\r\nressorts de plus que dans les animaux les plus parfaits, le cerveau\r\nproportionnellement plus proche du coeur, et recevant aussi plus de\r\nsang, la même raison donnée; que sais-je enfin? des causes inconnues\r\nproduiraient toujours cette conscience délicate, si facile à blesser,\r\nces remords qui ne sont pas plus étrangers à la matière que la pensée,\r\net en un mot toute la différence qu'on suppose ici. L'organisation\r\nsuffirait-elle donc a tout? oui, encore une fois. Puisque la pensée\r\nse développe visiblement avec les organes, pourquoi la matière dont\r\nils sont faits ne serait-elle pas aussi susceptible de remords,\r\nquand une fois elle a acquis avec le temps la faculté de sentir?\r\n\r\nL'âme n'est donc qu'un vain terme dont on n'a point d'idée, et dont\r\nun bon esprit ne doit se servir que pour nommer la partie qui pense\r\nen nous. Posé le moindre principe de mouvement, les corps animés\r\nauront tout ce qu'il leur faut pour se mouvoir, sentir, penser,\r\nse repentir, et se conduire en un mot dans le physique, et dans le\r\nmoral qui en dépend.\r\n\r\nNous ne supposons rien; ceux qui croiraient que toutes les difficultés\r\nne seraient pas encore levées, vont trouver des expériences, qui\r\nachèveront de les satisfaire.\r\n\r\n1. Toutes les chairs des animaux palpitent après la mort, d'autant\r\nplus longtemps que l'animal est plus froid et transpire moins: les\r\ntortues, les lézards, les serpents, etc. en font foi.\r\n\r\n2. Les muscles séparés du corps, se retirent, lorsqu'on les pique.\r\n\r\n3. Les entrailles conservent longtemps leur mouvement péristaltique,\r\nou vermiculaire.\r\n\r\n4. Une simple injection d'eau chaude ranime le coeur et les muscles,\r\nsuivant Cowper.\r\n\r\n5. Le coeur de la grenouille, surtout exposé au soleil, encore mieux\r\nsur une table ou une assiette chaude, se remue pendant une heure et\r\nplus, après avoir été arraché du corps. Le mouvement semble-t-il\r\nperdu sans ressource? il n'y a qu'à piquer le coeur, et ce muscle\r\ncreux bat encore. Harvey a fait la même observation sur les crapauds.\r\n\r\n6. Bacon de Verulam, dans son Traité Sylva-Sylvarum, parle d'un homme\r\nconvaincu de trahison, qu'on ouvrit vivant, et dont le coeur jeté\r\ndans l'eau chaude sauta à plusieurs reprises, toujours moins haut,\r\nà la distance perpendiculaire de 2 pieds.\r\n\r\n7. Prenez un petit poulet encore dans l'oeuf; arrachez lui le coeur;\r\nvous observerez les mêmes phénomènes, avec à peu près les mêmes\r\ncirconstances. La seule chaleur de l'haleine ranime un animal prêt\r\nà périr dans la machine pneumatique.\r\n\r\nLes mêmes expériences que nous devons à Boyle et à Sténon, se font dans\r\nles pigeons, dans les chiens, dans les lapins, dont les morceaux de\r\ncoeur se remuent, comme les coeurs entiers. On voit le même mouvement\r\ndans les pattes de taupe arrachées.\r\n\r\n8. La chenille, les vers, l'araignée, la mouche, l'anguille offrent\r\nles mêmes choses à considérer; et le mouvement des parties coupées\r\naugmente dans l'eau chaude, à cause du feu qu'elle contient.\r\n\r\n9. Un soldat ivre emporta d'un coup de sabre la tête d'un coq\r\nd'Inde. Cet animal resta debout, ensuite il marcha, courut; venant à\r\nrencontrer une muraille, il se tourna, battit des ailes, en continuant\r\nde courir, et tomba enfin. Etendu par terre, tous les muscles de\r\nce coq se remuaient encore. Voilà ce que j'ai vu, et il est facile\r\nde voir à peu près ces phénomènes dans les petits chats, ou chiens,\r\ndont on a coupé la tête.\r\n\r\n10. Les polypes font plus que de se mouvoir, après la section; ils\r\nse reproduisent dans huit jours en autant d'animaux qu'il y a de\r\nparties coupées. J'en suis fâché pour le système des naturalistes\r\nsur la génération, ou plutôt j'en suis bien aise; car que cette\r\ndécouverte nous apprend bien à ne jamais rien conclure de général,\r\nmême de toutes les expériences connues, et les plus décisives!\r\n\r\nVoilà beaucoup plus de faits qu'il n'en faut, pour prouver d'une\r\nmanière incontestable que chaque petite fibre, ou partie des corps\r\norganisés, se meut par un principe qui lui est propre, et dont l'action\r\nne dépend point des nerfs, comme les mouvements volontaires, puisque\r\nles mouvements en question s'exercent sans que les parties qui les\r\nmanifestent aient aucun commerce avec la circulation. Or, si cette\r\nforce se fait remarquer jusques dans des morceaux de fibres, le coeur,\r\nqui est un composé de fibres singulièrement entrelacées, doit avoir la\r\nmême propriété. L'histoire de Bacon n'était pas nécessaire pour me le\r\npersuader. Il m'était facile d'en juger, et par la parfaite analogie\r\nde la structure du coeur de l'homme et des animaux; et par la masse\r\nmême du premier, dans laquelle ce mouvement ne se cache aux yeux,\r\nque parce qu'il y est étouffé; et enfin parce que tout est froid et\r\naffaissé dans les cadavres. Si les dissections se faisaient sur des\r\ncriminels suppliciés, dont les corps sont encore chauds, on verrait\r\ndans leur coeur les mêmes mouvements qu'on observe dans les muscles\r\ndu visage des gens décapités.\r\n\r\nTel est ce principe moteur des corps entiers, ou des parties coupées en\r\nmorceaux, qu'il produit des mouvements non déréglés, comme on l'a cru,\r\nmais très réguliers, et cela, tant dans les animaux chauds et parfaits,\r\nque dans ceux qui sont froids et imparfaits. Il ne reste donc aucune\r\nressource à nos adversaires, si ce n'est que de nier mille et mille\r\nfaits que chacun peut facilement vérifier.\r\n\r\nSi on me demande à présent quel est le siège de cette force innée dans\r\nnos corps, je réponds qu'elle réside très clairement dans ce que les\r\nanciens ont appellé parenchyme; c'est à dire dans la substance propre\r\ndes parties, abstraction faite des veines, des artères, des nerfs,\r\nen un mot de l'organisation de tout le corps; et que par conséquent\r\nchaque partie contient en soi des ressorts plus ou moins vifs, selon\r\nle besoin qu'elles en avaient.\r\n\r\nEntrons dans quelque détail de ces ressorts de la machine humaine. Tous\r\nles mouvements vitaux, animaux, naturels et automatiques se font par\r\nleur action. N'est-ce pas machinalement que le corps se retire, frappé\r\nde terreur à l'aspect d'un précipice inattendu? que les paupières\r\nse baissent à la menace d'un coup, comme on l'a dit? que la pupille\r\ns'étrécit au grand jour pour conserver la rétine, et s'élargit pour\r\nvoir les objets dans l'obscurité? n'est-ce pas machinalement que les\r\npores de la peau se ferment en hiver, pour que le froid ne pénètre\r\npas l'intérieur des vaisseaux? que l'estomac se soulève, irrité par\r\nle poison, par une certaine quantité d'opium, par tous les émétiques,\r\netc.? que le coeur, les artères, les muscles se contractent pendant\r\nle sommeil, comme pendant la veille? que le poumon fait l'office d'un\r\nsouflet continuellement exercé? n'est-ce pas machinalement qu'agissent\r\ntous les sphincters de la vessie, du rectum, etc.? que le coeur a\r\nune contraction plus forte que tout autre muscle? que les muscles\r\nérecteurs font dresser la verge dans l'homme, comme dans les animaux\r\nqui s'en battent le ventre, et même dans l'enfant, capable d'érection,\r\npour peu que cette partie soit irritée? Ce qui prouve, pour le dire\r\nen passant, qu'il est un ressort singulier dans ce membre, encore peu\r\nconnu, et qui produit des effets qu'on n'a point encore bien expliqués,\r\nmalgré toutes les lumières de l'anatomie.\r\n\r\nJe ne m'étendrai pas davantage sur tous ces petits ressorts\r\nsubalternes connus de tout le monde. Mais il en est un autre plus\r\nsubtil, et plus merveilleux qui les anime tous; il est la source de\r\ntous nos sentiments, de tous nos plaisirs, de toutes nos passions, de\r\ntoutes nos pensées; car le cerveau a ses muscles pour penser, comme\r\nles jambes pour marcher. Je veux parler de ce principe incitant,\r\net impétueux, qu'Hippocrate appelle enormôn (l'âme). Ce principe\r\nexiste, et il a son siège dans le cerveau à l'origine des nerfs,\r\npar lesquels il exerce son empire sur tout le reste du corps. Par là\r\ns'explique tout ce qui peut s'expliquer, jusqu'aux effets surprenants\r\ndes maladies de l'imagination.\r\n\r\nMais, pour ne pas languir dans une richesse et une fécondité mal\r\nentendue, il faut se borner à un petit nombre de questions et de\r\nréflexions.\r\n\r\nPourquoi la vue ou la simple idée d'une belle femme nous cause-t-elle\r\ndes mouvements et des désirs singuliers? Ce qui se passe alors dans\r\ncertains organes, vient-il de la nature même de ces organes? Point\r\ndu tout; mais du commerce et de l'espèce de sympathie de ces muscles\r\navec l'imagination. Il n'y a ici qu'un premier ressort excité par le\r\nbene placitum des anciens, ou par l'image de la beauté, qui en excite\r\nun autre, lequel était fort assoupi, quand l'imagination l'a éveillé:\r\net comment cela, si ce n'est par le désordre et le tumulte du sang\r\net des esprits, qui galopent avec une promptitude extraordinaire,\r\net vont gonfler les corps caverneux?\r\n\r\nPuisqu'il est des communications évidentes entre la mère et l'enfant\r\n[7], et qu'il est dur de nier des faits rapportés par Tulpius et\r\npar d'autres écrivains aussi dignes de foi (il n'y en a point qui le\r\nsoient plus), nous croirons que c'est par la même voie que le foetus\r\nressent l'impétuosité de l'imagination maternelle, comme une cire\r\nmolle reçoit toutes sortes d'impressions; et que les mêmes traces,\r\nou envies de la mère, peuvent s'imprimer sur le foetus, sans que\r\ncela puisse se comprendre, quoiqu'en disent Blondel et tous ses\r\nadhérents. Ainsi nous faisons réparation d'honneur au P. Malebranche,\r\nbeaucoup trop raillé de sa crédulité par les auteurs qui n'ont point\r\nobservé d'assez près la nature et ont voulu l'assujettir à leur idées.\r\n\r\nVoyez le portrait de ce fameux Pope, au moins le Voltaire\r\ndes Anglais. Les efforts, les nerfs de son génie sont peints\r\nsur sa physionomie; elle est toute en convulsion; ses yeux\r\nsortent de l'orbite, ses sourcils s'élèvent avec les muscles du\r\nfront. Pourquoi? C'est que l'origine des nerfs est en travail et que\r\ntout le corps doit se ressentir d'une espèce d'accouchement aussi\r\nlaborieux. S'il n'y avait une corde interne qui tirât ainsi celles\r\ndu dehors, d'où viendraient tous ces phénomènes? Admettre une âme,\r\npour les expliquer, c'est être réduit à l'opération du St. Esprit.\r\n\r\nEn effet, si ce qui pense en mon cerveau n'est pas une partie\r\nde ce viscère, et conséquemment de tout le corps, pourquoi,\r\nlorsque tranquille dans mon lit je forme le plan d'un ouvrage,\r\nou que je poursuis un raisonnement abstrait, pourquoi mon sang\r\ns'échauffe-t-il? pourquoi la fièvre de mon esprit passe-t-elle dans\r\nmes veines? Demandez-le aux hommes d'imagination, aux grandes poètes,\r\nà ceux qu'un sentiment bien rendu ravit, qu'un goût exquis, que les\r\ncharmes de la nature, de la vérité ou de la vertu transportent! Par\r\nleur enthousiasme, par ce qu'ils vous diront avoir éprouvé, vous\r\njugerez de la cause par les effets: par cette harmonie que Borelli,\r\nqu'un seul anatomiste a mieux connue que tous les Leibniziens, vous\r\nconnaîtrez l'unité matérielle de l'homme. Car enfin si la tension des\r\nnerfs qui fait la douleur, cause la fièvre, par laquelle l'esprit\r\nest troublé et n'a plus de volonté; et que réciproquement l'esprit\r\ntrop exercé trouble le corps, et allume ce feu de consomption qui a\r\nenlevé Bayle dans un âge si peu avancé; si telle titillation me fait\r\nvouloir, me force de désirer ardemment ce dont je ne me souciais\r\nnullement le moment d'auparavant; si à leur tour certaines traces\r\ndu cerveau excitent le même prurit et les mêmes désirs, pourquoi\r\nfaire double ce qui n'est évidemment qu'un? C'est en vain qu'on se\r\nrécrie sur l'empire de la volonté. Pour un ordre qu'elle donne, elle\r\nsubit cent fois le joug. Et quelle merveille que le corps obéisse dan\r\nl'état sain, puisqu'un torrent de sang et d'esprits vient l'y forcer,\r\nla volonté ayant pour ministres une légion invisible de fluides plus\r\nvifs que l'éclair, et toujours prêts a la servir! Mais comme c'est\r\npar les nerfs que son pouvoir s'exerce, c'est aussi par eux qu'il est\r\narrêté. La meilleure volonté d'un amant épuisé, les plus violents\r\ndésirs lui rendront-ils sa vigueur perdue? Hélas! non; et elle en\r\nsera la première punie, parceque, posées certaines circonstances,\r\nil n'est pas dans sa puissance de ne pas vouloir du plaisir. Ce que\r\nj'ai dit de la paralysie, etc. revient ici.\r\n\r\nLa jaunisse vous surprend! ne savez vous pas que la couleur\r\ndes corps dépend de celle des verres au travers desquels on les\r\nregarde! Ignorez-vous que telle est la teinte des humeurs, telle\r\nest celle des objets, au moins par rapport à nous, vains jouets\r\nde mille illusions? Mais ôtez cette teinte de l'humeur aqueuse de\r\nl'oeil; faites couler la bile par son tamis naturel: alors l'âme\r\nayant d'autres yeux, ne verra plus jaune. N'est ce pas encore ainsi\r\nqu'en abattant la cataracte, ou en injectant le canal d'Eustachi,\r\non rend la vue aux aveugles, et l'ouie aux sourds? Combien de gens\r\nqui n'étaient peut-être que d'habiles charlatans dans des siècles\r\nignorants, ont passé pour faire de grands miracles! La belle âme et\r\nla puissante volonté, qui ne peut agir qu'autant que les dispositions\r\ndu corps le lui permettent, et dont les goûts changent avec l'âge et\r\nla fièvre! Faut-il donc s'étonner si les philosophes ont toujours eu\r\nen vue la santé du corps pour conserver celle de l'âme, si Pythagore\r\na aussi soigneusement ordonné la diète, que Platon a défendu le\r\nvin? Le régime qui convient au corps, est toujours celui par lequel\r\nles médecins sensés prétendent qu'on doit préluder, lorsqu'il s'agit\r\nde former l'esprit, de l'élever à la connaissance de la vérité et de\r\nla vertu; vains sons dans le désordre des maladies et le tumulte des\r\nsens! Sans les préceptes de l'hygiène, Epictète, Socrate, Platon,\r\netc. prêchent en vain: toute morale est infructueuse, pour qui n'a\r\npas la sobrieté en partage: c'est la source de toutes les vertus\r\ncomme l'intempérance est celle de tous les vices.\r\n\r\nEn faut-il davantage (et pourquoi irais-je me perdre dans l'histoire\r\ndes passions, qui toutes s'expliquent par l'enormôn d'Hippocrate) pour\r\nprouver que l'homme n'est qu'un animal, ou un assemblage de ressorts,\r\nqui tous se montent les uns par les autres, sans qu'on puisse dire\r\npar quel point du cercle humain la nature a commencé? Si ces ressorts\r\ndiffèrent entr'eux, ce n'est donc que par leur siège et par quelques\r\ndegrés de force, et jamais par leur nature; et par conséquent l'âme\r\nn'est qu'un principe de mouvement, ou une partie matérielle sensible\r\ndu cerveau, qu'on peut, sans craindre l'erreur, regarder comme un\r\nressort principal de toute la machine, qui a une influence visible\r\nsur tous les autres, et même parait avoir été fait le premier; en\r\nsorte que tous les autres n'en seraient qu'une émanation, comme on\r\nle verra par quelques observations que je rapporterai et qui ont été\r\nfaites sur divers embryons.\r\n\r\nCette oscillation naturelle, ou propre à notre machine, et dont est\r\ndouée chaque fibre, et, pour ainsi dire, chaque élément fibreux,\r\nsemblable à celle d'une pendule, ne peut toujours s'exercer. Il faut\r\nla renouveler, à mesure qu'elle se perd; lui donner des forces, quand\r\nelle languit; l'affaiblir, lorsqu'elle est opprimée par un excès de\r\nforce et de vigueur. C'est en cela seul que la vraie médecine consiste.\r\n\r\nLe corps n'est qu'une horloge, dont le nouveau chyle est l'horloger. Le\r\npremier soin de la nature, quand il entre dans le sang, c'est d'y\r\nexciter une sorte de fièvre, que les chimistes, qui ne rêvent que\r\nfourneaux, ont dû prendre pour une fermentation. Cette fièvre procure\r\nune plus grande filtration d'esprits, qui machinalement vont animer\r\nles muscles et le coeur, comme s'ils y étaient envoyés par ordre de\r\nla volonté.\r\n\r\nCe sont donc les causes ou les forces de la vie qui entretiennent\r\nainsi durant 100 ans le mouvement perpétuel des solides et des\r\nfluides, aussi nécessaire aux uns qu'aux autres. Mais qui peut dire\r\nsi les solides contribuent à ce jeu, plus que les fluides, et vice\r\nversa? Tout ce qu'on sait, c'est que l'action des premiers serait\r\nbientôt anéantie, sans le secours des seconds. Ce sont les liqueurs\r\nqui par leur choc éveillent et conservent l'élasticité des vaisseaux,\r\nde laquelle dépend leur propre circulation. De là vient qu'après la\r\nmort le ressort naturel de chaque substance est plus ou moins fort\r\nencore suivant les restes de la vie, auxquels il survit, pour expirer\r\nle dernier. Tant il est vrai que cette force des parties animales peut\r\nbien se conserver et s'augmenter par celle de la circulation, mais\r\nqu'elle n'en dépend point, puisqu'elle se passe même de l'intégrité\r\nde chaque membre, ou viscère, comme on l'a vu.\r\n\r\nJe n'ignore pas que cette opinion n'a pas été goûtée de tous les\r\nsavants, et que Stahl surtout l'a fort dédaignée. Ce grand chimiste\r\na voulu nous persuader que l'âme était la seule cause de tous nos\r\nmouvements. Mais c'est parler en fanatique, et non en philosophe.\r\n\r\nPour détruire l'hypothèse Stahlienne, il ne faut pas faire tant\r\nd'efforts que je vois qu'on en a faits avant moi. Il n'y a qu'à jeter\r\nles yeux sur un joueur de violon. Quelle souplesse! Quelle agilité\r\ndans les doigts! Les mouvements sont si prompts, qu'il ne paraît\r\npresque pas y avoir de succession. Or, je prie, ou plutôt je défie\r\nles Stahliens de me dire, eux qui connaissent si bien tout ce que peut\r\nnotre âme, comment il serait possible qu'elle exécutât si vite tant de\r\nmouvements, des mouvements qui se passent si loin d'elle, et en tant\r\nd'endroits divers. C'est supposer un joueur de flûte qui pourrait faire\r\nde brillantes cadences sur une infinité de trous qu'il ne connaitrait\r\npas, et auxquels il ne pourrait seulement pas appliquer le doigt.\r\n\r\nMais disons avec Mr. Hecquet qu'il n'est pas permis à tout le monde\r\nd'aller à Corinthe. Et pourquoi Stahl n'aurait-il pas été encore plus\r\nfavorisé de la nature en qualité d'homme, qu'en qualité de chimiste et\r\nde praticien? Il fallait (heureux mortel!) qu'il eût reçu une autre\r\nâme que le reste des hommes; une âme souveraine, qui non contente\r\nd'avoir quelque empire sur les muscles volontaires, tenait sans peine\r\nles rênes de tous les mouvements du corps, pouvait les suspendre, les\r\ncalmer, ou les exciter à son gré. Avec une maîtresse aussi despotique,\r\ndans les mains de laquelle étaient en quelque sorte les battements\r\ndu coeur et les lois de la circulation, point de fièvre sans doute;\r\npoint de douleur; point de langueur; ni honteuse impuissance, ni\r\nfacheux priapisme. L'âme veut, et les ressorts jouent, se dressent,\r\nou se débandent. Comment ceux de la machine de Stahl se sont-ils sitôt\r\ndétraqués? Qui a chez soi un si grand médecin, devrait être immortel.\r\n\r\nStahl, au reste, n'est pas le seul qui ait rejeté le principe\r\nd'oscillation des corps organisés. De plus grands esprits ne l'ont pas\r\nemployé, lorsqu'ils ont voulu expliquer l'action du coeur, l'érection\r\ndu penis, etc. Il n'y a qu'à lire les Institutions de médecine de\r\nBoerhaave, pour voir quels laborieux et séduisants systèmes, faute\r\nd'admettre une force aussi frappante dans tous les corps, ce grand\r\nhomme a été obligé d'enfanter à la sueur de son puissant génie.\r\n\r\nWillis et Perrault, esprits d'une plus faible trempe, mais observateurs\r\nassidus de la nature, que le fameux professeur de Leyde n'a connue\r\nque par autrui et n'a eue, pour ainsi dire, que de la seconde main,\r\nparaissent avoir mieux aimé supposer une âme généralement répandue\r\npar tout le corps, que le principe dont nous parlons. Mais dans\r\ncette hypothèse qui fut celle de Virgile et de tous les Epicuriens,\r\nhypothèse que l'histoire du polype semblerait favoriser à la première\r\nvue, les mouvements qui survivent au sujet dans lequel ils sont\r\ninhérents viennent d'un reste d'âme, que conservent encore les parties\r\nqui se contractent, sans être désormais irritées par le sang et les\r\nesprits. D'où l'on voit que ces écrivains dont les ouvrages solides\r\néclipsent aisément toutes les fables philosophiques, ne se sont trompés\r\nque sur le modèle de ceux qui ont donné à la matière la faculté de\r\npenser, je veux dire, pour s'être mal exprimés, en termes obscurs,\r\net qui ne signifient rien. En effet, qu'est ce que ce reste d'âme,\r\nsi ce n'est la force motrice des Leibniziens, mal rendue par une\r\ntelle expression, et que cependant Perrault surtout a véritablement\r\nentrevue. Voy. son Traité de la Mécanique des Animaux.\r\n\r\nA présent qu'il est clairement démontré contre les Cartésiens, les\r\nStahliens, les Malebranchistes, et les théologiens peu dignes d'être\r\nici placés, que la matière se meut par elle-même, non seulement\r\nlorsqu'elle est organisée, comme dans un coeur entier, par exemple,\r\nmais lors même que cette organisation est détruite, la curiosité de\r\nl'homme voudrait savoir comment un corps, par cela même qu'il est\r\noriginairement doué d'un souffle de vie, se trouve en conséquence orné\r\nde la faculté de sentir, et enfin par celle-ci de la pensée. Et pour\r\nen venir à bout, ô bon Dieu, quels efforts n'ont pas faits certains\r\nphilosophes! et quel galimatias j'ai eu la patience de lire à ce sujet!\r\n\r\nTout ce que l'expérience nous apprend, c'est que tant que le mouvement\r\nsubsiste, si petit qu'il soit dans une ou plusieurs fibres, il n'y a\r\nqu'à les piquer, pour réveiller, animer ce mouvement presque éteint,\r\ncomme on l'a vu dans cette foule d'expériences dont j'ai voulu accabler\r\nles systèmes. Il est donc constant que le mouvement et le sentiment\r\ns'excitent tour à tour, et dans les corps entiers, et dans les mêmes\r\ncorps dont la structure est détruite; pour ne rien dire de certaines\r\nplantes qui semblent nous offrir les mêmes phénomènes de la réunion\r\ndu sentiment et du mouvement.\r\n\r\nMais de plus, combien d'excellents philosophes ont démontré que la\r\npensée n'est qu'une faculté de sentir, et que l'âme raisonnable\r\nn'est que l'âme sensitive appliquée à contempler les idées, et\r\nà raisonner! Ce qui serait prouvé par cela seul que lorsque le\r\nsentiment est éteint, la pensée l'est aussi, comme dans l'apoplexie,\r\nla léthargie, la catalepsie, etc. Car ceux qui ont avancé que l'âme\r\nn'avait pas moins pensé dans les maladies soporeuses, quoiqu'elle\r\nne se souvint pas des idées qu'elle avait eues, ont soutenu une\r\nchose ridicule.\r\n\r\nPour ce qui est de ce développement, c'est une folie de perdre le\r\ntemps à en rechercher le mécanisme. La nature du mouvement nous\r\nest aussi inconnue que celle de la matière. Le moyen de découvrir\r\ncomment il s'y produit, à moins que de ressusciter avec l'auteur de\r\nl'Histoire de l'Ame l'ancienne et inintelligible doctrine des formes\r\nsubstantielles! Je suis donc aussi consolé d'ignorer comment la\r\nmatière, d'inerte et simple, devient active et composée d'organes,\r\nque de ne pouvoir regarder le soleil sans verre rouge: et je suis\r\nd'aussi bonne composition sur les autres merveilles incompréhensibles\r\nde la nature, sur la production du sentiment et de la pensée dans un\r\nêtre qui ne paraissait autrefois à nos yeux bornés qu'un peu de boue.\r\n\r\nQu'on m'accorde seulement que la matière organisée est douée d'un\r\nprincipe moteur, qui seul la différencie de celle qui ne l'est pas\r\n(eh! peut-on rien refuser à l'observation la plus incontestable?) et\r\nque tout dépend dans les animaux de la diversité de cette organisation,\r\ncomme je l'ai assez prouvé; c'en est assez pour deviner l'énigme des\r\nsubstances et celle de l'homme. On voit qu'il n'y en a qu'une dans\r\nl'univers et que l'homme est la plus parfaite. Il est au singe, aux\r\nanimaux les plus spirituels, ce que le pendule planétaire de Huygens\r\nest à une montre de Julien le Roi. S'il a fallu plus d'instruments,\r\nplus de rouages, plus de ressorts pour marquer les mouvements des\r\nplanètes, que pour marquer les heures, ou les répéter; s'il a fallu\r\nplus d'art à Vaucanson pour faire son Fluteur, que pour son Canard,\r\nil eût dû en employer encore davantage pour faire un Parleur; machine\r\nqui ne peut plus être regardée comme impossible, surtout entre les\r\nmains d'un nouveau Prométhée. Il était donc de même nécessaire que la\r\nnature employât plus d'art et d'appareil pour faire et entretenir une\r\nmachine, qui pendant un siècle entier pût marquer tous les battements\r\ndu coeur et de l'esprit; car si on n'en voit pas au pouls les heures,\r\nc'est du moins le baromètre de la chaleur et de la vivacité, par\r\nlaquelle on peut juger de la nature de l'âme. Je ne me trompe point,\r\nle corps humain est une horloge, mais immense, et construite avec\r\ntant d'artifice et d'habileté, que si la roue qui sert à marquer les\r\nsecondes vient à s'arrêter, celle des minutes tourne et va toujours\r\nson train, comme la roue des quarts continue de se mouvoir; et ainsi\r\ndes autres, quand les premières, rouillées, ou dérangées par quelque\r\ncause que ce soit, ont interrompu leur marche. Car n'est-ce pas ainsi\r\nque l'obstruction de quelques vaisseaux ne suffit pas pour détruire,\r\nou suspendre le fort des mouvements, qui est dans le coeur, comme dans\r\nla pièce ouvrière de la machine; puisqu'au contraire les fluides dont\r\nle volume est diminué, ayant moins de chemin a faire, le parcourent\r\nd'autant plus vite, emportés comme par un nouveau courant, que la\r\nforce du coeur s'augmente en raison de la résistance qu'il trouve\r\nà l'extrémité des vaisseaux? Lorsque le nerf optique seul comprimé\r\nne laisse plus passer l'image des objets, n'est-ce pas ainsi que\r\nla privation de la vue n'empêche pas plus l'usage de l'ouïe, que la\r\nprivation de ce sens, lorsque les fonctions de la portion molle sont\r\ninterdites, ne suppose celle de l'autre? N'est-ce pas ainsi encore\r\nque l'un entend, sans pouvoir dire qu'il entend (si ce n'est après\r\nl'attaque du mal) et que l'autre qui n'entend rien, mais dont les\r\nnerfs linguaux sont libres dans le cerveau, dit machinalement tous les\r\nrêves qui lui passent par la tête? Phénomènes qui ne surprennent point\r\nles médecins éclairés. Ils savent à quoi s'en tenir sur la nature de\r\nl'homme; et pour le dire en passant: de deux médecins, le meilleur,\r\ncelui qui mérite le plus de confiance, c'est toujours, à mon avis,\r\ncelui qui est le plus versé dans la physique, ou la mécanique du corps\r\nhumain, et qui laissant l'âme et toutes les inquiétudes que cette\r\nchimère donne aux sots et aux ignorans, n'est occupé sérieusement\r\nque du pur naturalisme.\r\n\r\nLaissons donc le prétendu Mr. Charp se moquer des philosophes qui ont\r\nregardé les animaux, comme des machines. Que je pense différemment! Je\r\ncrois que Descartes serait un homme respectable à tous égards, si,\r\nné dans un siècle qu'il n'eût pas dû éclairer, il eût connu le prix de\r\nl'expérience et de l'observation, et le danger de s'en écarter. Mais\r\nil n'est pas moins juste que je fasse ici une authentique réparation\r\nà ce grand homme, pour tous ces petits philosophes mauvais plaisants,\r\net mauvais singes de Locke, qui, au lieu de rire impudemment au nez\r\nde Descartes, feraient mieux de sentir que sans lui le champ de la\r\nphilosophie, comme celui du bon esprit sans Newton, serait peut être\r\nencore en friche.\r\n\r\nIl est vrai que ce célèbre philosophe s'est beaucoup trompé, et\r\npersonne n'en disconvient. Mais enfin il a connu la nature animale;\r\nil a le premier parfaitement démontré que les animaux étaient de pures\r\nmachines. Or, après une découverte de cette importance et qui suppose\r\nautant de sagacité, le moyen, sans ingratitude, de ne pas faire grâce\r\nà toutes ses erreurs!\r\n\r\nElles sont à mes yeux toutes réparées par ce grand aveu. Car enfin,\r\nquoiqu'il chante sur la distinction des deux substances, il est visible\r\nque ce n'est qu'un tour d'adresse, une ruse de style, pour faire avaler\r\naux théologiens un poison caché à l'ombre d'une analogie qui frappe\r\ntout le monde, et qu'eux seuls ne voient pas. Car c'est elle, c'est\r\ncette forte analogie qui force tous les savants et les vrais juges\r\nd'avouer que ces êtres fiers et vains, plus distingués par leur orgueil\r\nque par le nom d'hommes, quelque envie qu'ils aient de s'élever,\r\nne sont au fond que des animaux et des machines perpendiculairement\r\nrampantes. Elles ont toutes ce merveilleux instinct, dont l'éducation\r\nfait de l'esprit, et qui a toujours son siège dans le cerveau, et à son\r\ndéfaut, comme lorsqu'il manque ou est ossifié, dans la moëlle allongée,\r\net jamais dans le cervelet; car je l'ai vu considérablement blessé,\r\nd'autres [8] l'ont trouvé squirreux, sans que l'âme cessât de faire\r\nses fonctions.\r\n\r\nEtre machine, sentir, penser, savoir distinguer le bien du mal, comme\r\nle bleu du jaune, en un mot être né avec de l'intelligence et un\r\ninstinct sûr de morale, et n'être qu'un animal, sont donc des choses\r\nqui ne sont pas plus contradictoires qu'être un singe ou un perroquet\r\net savoir se donner du plaisir. Car, puisque l'occasion se présente de\r\nle dire, qui eut jamais deviné à priori qu'une goutte de la liqueur\r\nqui se lance dans l'accouplement fit ressentir des plaisirs divins,\r\net qu'il en naîtrait une petite créature, qui pourrait un jour,\r\nposées certaines lois, jouir des mêmes délices? Je crois la pensée\r\nsi peu incompatible avec la matière organisée, qu'elle semble en\r\nêtre une propriété, telle que l'électricité, la faculté motrice,\r\nl'impénétrabilité, l'étendue, etc.\r\n\r\nVoulez vous de nouvelles observations? En voici qui sont sans réplique\r\net qui prouvent toutes que l'homme ressemble parfaitement aux animaux\r\ndans son origine, comme dans tout ce que nous avons déjà cru essentiel\r\nde comparer.\r\n\r\nJ'en appelle à la bonne foi de nos observateurs. Qu'ils nous disent\r\ns'il n'est pas vrai que l'homme dans son principe n'est qu'un ver,\r\nqui devient homme, comme la chenille papillon. Les plus graves [9]\r\nauteurs nous ont appris comment il faut s'y prendre pour voir cet\r\nanimalcule. Tous les curieux l'ont vu, comme Hartsoeker, dans la\r\nsemence de l'homme, et non dans celle de la femme; il n'y a que les\r\nsots qui s'en soient fait scrupule. Comme chaque goutte de sperme\r\ncontient une infinité de ces petits vers lorsqu'ils sont lancés à\r\nl'ovaire, il n'y a que le plus adroit, ou le plus vigoureux qui ait la\r\nforce de s'insinuer et de s'implanter dans l'oeuf que fournit la femme,\r\net qui lui donne sa première nourriture. Cet oeuf, quelquefois surpris\r\ndans les trompes de Fallope, est porté par ces canaux à la matrice, où\r\nil prend racine, comme un grain de blé dans la terre. Mais quoiqu'il y\r\ndevienne monstrueux par sa croissance de 9 mois, il ne diffère point\r\ndes oeufs des autres femelles, si ce n'est que sa peau (l'amnios)\r\nne se durcit jamais, et se dilate prodigieusement, comme on en peut\r\njuger en comparant les foetus trouvés en situation et près d'éclore\r\n(ce que j'ai eu le plaisir d'observer dans une femme morte un moment\r\navant l'accouchement), avec d'autres petits embryons très proches\r\nde leur origine: car alors c'est toujours l'oeuf dans sa coque,\r\net l'animal dans l'oeuf, qui, gêné dans ses mouvements, cherche\r\nmachinalement à voir le jour; et pour y réussir, il commence par\r\nrompre avec la tête cette membrane, d'oû il sort, comme le poulet,\r\nl'oiseau, etc., de la leur. J'ajouterai une observation que je ne\r\ntrouve nulle part; c'est que l'amnios n'en est pas plus mince, pour\r\ns'être prodigieusement étendu; semblable en cela à la matrice dont\r\nla substance même se gonfle de sucs infiltrés, indépendamment de la\r\nréplétion et du déploiement de tous ses coudes vasculeux.\r\n\r\nVoyons l'homme dans et hors de sa coque; examinons avec un microscope\r\nles plus jeunes embryons, de 4, de 6, de 8 ou de 15 jours; après ce\r\ntemps les yeux suffisent. Que voit-on? la tête seule; un petit oeuf\r\nrond avec deux points noirs qui marquent les yeux. Avant ce temps,\r\ntout étant plus informe, on n'aperçoit qu'une pulpe médullaire, qui\r\nest le cerveau, dans lequel se forme d'abord l'origine des nerfs,\r\nou le principe du sentiment, et le coeur qui a déjà par lui-même dans\r\ncette pulpe la faculté de battre: c'est le punctum saliens de Malpighi,\r\nqui doit peut-être déjà une partie de sa vivacité à l'influence des\r\nnerfs. Ensuite peu-à-peu on voit la tête allonger le col, qui en\r\nse dilatant forme d'abord le thorax, où le coeur a déjà descendu,\r\npour s'y fixer; après quoi vient le bas ventre qu'une cloison (le\r\ndiaphragme) sépare. Ces dilatations donnent l'une, les bras, les\r\nmains, les doigts, les ongles, et les poils; l'autre les cuisses,\r\nles jambes, les pieds, etc., avec la seule différence de situation\r\nqu'on leur connait, qui fait l'appui et le balancier du corps. C'est\r\nune végétation frappante. Ici, ce sont des cheveux qui couvrent le\r\nsommet de nos têtes; là, ce sont des feuilles et des fleurs. Partout\r\nbrille le même luxe de la nature; et enfin l'esprit recteur des plantes\r\nest placé où nous avons notre âme, cette autre quintessence de l'homme.\r\n\r\nTelle est l'uniformité de la nature qu'on commence à sentir,\r\net l'analogie du règne animal et végétal, de l'homme à la\r\nplante. Peut-être même y a-t-il des plantes animal, c'est-à-dire\r\nqui en végétant, ou se battent comme les polypes, ou font d'autres\r\nfonctions propres aux animaux?\r\n\r\nVoilà à peu près tout ce qu'on sait de la génération. Que les parties\r\nqui s'attirent, qui sont faites pour s'unir ensemble et pour occuper\r\ntelle ou telle place, se réunissent toutes suivant leur nature; et\r\nqu'ainsi se forment les yeux, le coeur, l'estomac et enfin tout le\r\ncorps, comme de grands hommes l'ont écrit, cela est possible. Mais,\r\ncomme l'expérience nous abandonne au milieu des ces subtilités,\r\nje ne supposerai rien, regardant tout ce qui ne frappe pas mes sens\r\ncomme un mystère impénétrable. Il est si rare que les deux semences\r\nse rencontrent dans le congrès, que je serais tenté de croire que la\r\nsemence de la femme est inutile à la génération.\r\n\r\nMais comment en expliquer les phénomènes, sans ce commode rapport\r\nde parties, qui rend si bien raison des ressemblances des enfants,\r\ntantôt au père, et tantôt à la mère? D'un autre côté, l'embarras d'une\r\nexplication doit-elle contrebalancer un fait? Il me parait que c'est\r\nle mâle qui fait tout, dans une femme qui dort, comme dans la plus\r\nlubrique. L'arrangement des parties serait donc fait de toute éternité\r\ndans le germe, ou dans le ver même de l'homme. Mais tout ceci est\r\nfort au-dessus de la portée des plus excellents observateurs. Comme\r\nils n'y peuvent rien saisir, ils ne peuvent pas plus juger de la\r\nmécanique de la formation et du développement des corps, qu'une taupe\r\ndu chemin qu'un cerf peut parcourir.\r\n\r\nNous sommes de vraies taupes dans le champ de la nature; nous n'y\r\nfaisons guères que le trajet de cet animal; et c'est notre orgueil qui\r\ndonne des bornes à ce qui n'en a point. Nous sommes dans le cas d'une\r\nmontre qui dirait: (un fabuliste en ferait un personnage de conséquence\r\ndans un ouvrage frivole) \"Quoi! c'est ce sot ouvrier qui m'a faite, moi\r\nqui divise le temps! moi qui marque si exactement le cours du soleil;\r\nmoi qui répète à haute voix les heures que j'indique! non, cela ne se\r\npeut pas.\" Nous dédaignons de même, ingrats que nous sommes, cette\r\nmère commune de tous les règnes, comme parlent les chimistes. Nous\r\nimaginons ou plutôt supposons une cause supérieure à celle à qui\r\nnous devons tout, et qui a véritablement tout fait d'une manière\r\ninconcevable. Non, la matière n'a rien de vil, qu'aux yeux grossiers\r\nqui la méconnaissent dans ses plus brillants ouvrages; et la nature\r\nn'est point une ouvrière bornée. Elle produit des millions d'hommes\r\navec plus de facilité et de plaisir, qu'un horloger n'a de peine à\r\nfaire la montre la plus composée. Sa puissance éclate également et dans\r\nla production du plus vil insecte, et dans celle de l'homme le plus\r\nsuperbe; le règne animal ne lui coûte pas plus que le végétal, ni le\r\nplus beau génie qu'un épi de blé. Jugeons donc par ce que nous voyons,\r\nde ce qui se dérobe à la curiosité de nos yeux et de nos recherches,\r\net n'imaginons rien au delà. Suivons le singe, le castor, l'éléphant,\r\netc., dans leurs opérations. S'il est évident qu'elles ne peuvent\r\nse faire sans intelligence, pourquoi la refuser à ces animaux? et si\r\nvous leur accordez une âme, fanatiques, vous êtes perdus; vous aurez\r\nbeau dire que vous ne décidez point sur sa nature, tandis que vous lui\r\nôtez l'immortalité; qui ne voit que c'est une assertion gratuite? qui\r\nne voit qu'elle doit être ou mortelle, ou immortelle, comme la nôtre,\r\ndont elle doit subir le même sort quel qu'il soit! et qu'ainsi c'est\r\ntomber dans Scilla pour vouloir éviter Caribde?\r\n\r\nBrisez la chaîne de vos préjugés; armez-vous du flambeau de\r\nl'expérience et vous ferez à la nature l'honneur qu'elle mérite,\r\nau lieu de rien conclure à son désavantage, de l'ignorance où elle\r\nvous a laissé. Ouvrez les yeux seulement, et laissez-là ce que vous\r\nne pouvez comprendre; et vous verrez que ce laboureur dont l'esprit\r\net les lumières ne s'étendent pas plus loin que les bords de son\r\nsillon, ne diffère point essentiellement du plus grand génie, comme\r\nl'eût prouvé la dissection des cerveaux de Descartes et de Newton:\r\nvous serez persuadé que l'imbécile ou le stupide sont des bêtes à\r\nfigure humaine, comme le singe plein d'esprit est un petit homme\r\nsous une autre forme; et qu'enfin tout dépendant absolument de la\r\ndiversité de l'organisation, un animal bien construit, à qui on a\r\nappris l'astronomie, peut prédire une éclipse, comme la guérison\r\nou la mort, lorsqu'il a porté quelque temps du génie et de bons\r\nyeux à l'école d'Hippocrate et au lit des malades. C'est par cette\r\nfile d'observations et de vérités qu'on parvient à lier à la matière\r\nl'admirable propriété de penser, sans qu'on en puisse voir les liens,\r\nparce que le sujet de cet attribut nous est essentiellement inconnu.\r\n\r\nNe disons point que toute machine, ou tout animal, périt tout-à-fait,\r\nou prend une autre forme, après la mort; car nous n'en savons\r\nabsolument rien. Mais assurer qu'une machine immortelle est une\r\nchimère, ou un être de raison, c'est faire un raisonnement aussi\r\nabsurde que celui que feraient des chenilles, qui, voyant les\r\ndépouilles de leurs semblables, déploreraient amèrement le sort de\r\nleur espèce qui leur semblerait s'anéantir. L'âme de ces insectes\r\n(car chaque animal a la sienne) est trop bornée pour comprendre\r\nles métamorphoses de la nature. Jamais un seul des plus rusés\r\nd'entr'eux n'eût imaginé qu'il dût devenir papillon. Il en est de\r\nmême de nous. Que savons-nous plus de notre destinée, que de notre\r\norigine? Soumettons-nous donc à une ignorance invincible de laquelle\r\nnotre bonheur dépend.\r\n\r\nQui pensera ainsi, sera sage, juste, tranquille sur son sort,\r\net par conséquent heureux. Il attendra la mort, sans la craindre,\r\nni la désirer; et chérissant la vie, comprenant à peine comment le\r\ndégoût vient corrompre un coeur dans ce lieu plein de délices; plein\r\nde respect pour la nature, plein de reconnaissance, d'attachement et\r\nde tendresse, à proportion du sentiment et des bienfaits qu'il en a\r\nreçus, heureux enfin de la sentir, et d'être au charmant spectacle de\r\nl'univers, il ne le détruira certainement jamais dans soi, ni dans les\r\nautres. Que dis-je! plein d'humanité, il en aimera le caractère jusques\r\ndans ses ennemis. Jugez comme il traitera les autres! Il plaindra\r\nles vicieux, sans les haïr; ce ne seront à ses yeux que des hommes\r\ncontrefaits. Mais en faisant grâce aux défauts de la conformation\r\nde l'esprit et du corps, il n'en admirera pas moins leurs beautés et\r\nleurs vertus. Ceux que la nature aura favorisés lui paraîtront mériter\r\nplus d'égards que ceux qu'elle aura traités en marâtre. C'est ainsi\r\nqu'on a vu que les dons naturels, la source de tout ce qui s'acquiert,\r\ntrouvent dans la bouche et le coeur du matérialiste des hommages que\r\ntout autre leur refuse injustement. Enfin le matérialiste convaincu,\r\nquoi que murmure sa propre vanité, qu'il n'est qu'une machine, ou\r\nun animal, ne maltraitera point ses semblables; trop instruit sur la\r\nnature de ces actions, dont l'inhumanité est toujours proportionnée\r\nau degré d'analogie prouvée ci devant; et ne voulant pas en un mot,\r\nsuivant la loi naturelle donnée à tous les animaux, faire à autrui\r\nce qu'il ne voudrait pas qu'il lui fît.\r\n\r\nConcluons donc hardiment que l'homme est une machine; et qu'il n'y a\r\ndans tout l'univers qu'une seule substance diversement modifiée. Ce\r\nn'est point ici une hypothèse élevée à force de demandes et de\r\nsuppositions: ce n'est point l'ouvrage du préjugé, ni même de ma\r\nraison seule; j'eusse dédaigné un guide que je crois si peu sûr, si\r\nmes sens portant, pour ainsi dire, le flambeau, ne m'eûssent engagé à\r\nla suivre, en l'éclairant. L'expérience m'a donc parlé pour la raison;\r\nc'est ainsi que je les ai jointes ensemble.\r\n\r\nMais on a dû voir que je ne me suis permis le raisonnement le\r\nplus rigoureux et le plus immédiatement tiré, qu'à la suite d'une\r\nmultitude d'observations physiques qu'aucun savant ne contestera; et\r\nc'est encore eux seuls que je reconnais pour juges des conséquences\r\nque j'en tire; récusant ici tout homme à préjugés, et qui n'est ni\r\nanatomiste, ni au fait de la seule philosophie qui soit ici de mise,\r\ncelle du corps humain. Que pourraient contre un chêne aussi ferme et\r\nsolide ces faibles roseaux de la théologie, de la métaphysique et\r\ndes écoles; armes puériles, semblables aux fleurets de nos salles,\r\nqui peuvent bien donner le plaisir de l'escrime, mais jamais entamer\r\nson adversaire. Faut-il dire que je parle de ces idées creuses et\r\ntriviales, de ces raisonnements rebattus et pitoyables, qu'on fera\r\nsur la prétendue incompatibilité de deux substances qui se touchent\r\net se remuent sans cesse l'une et l'autre, tant qu'il restera l'ombre\r\ndu préjugé ou de la superstition sur la terre? Voilà mon système,\r\nou plutôt la vérité, si je ne me trompe fort. Elle est courte et\r\nsimple. Dispute à présent qui voudra!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAN A MACHINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not enough for a wise man to study nature and truth; he should\r\ndare state truth for the benefit of the few who are willing and able\r\nto think. As for the rest, who are voluntarily slaves of prejudice,\r\nthey can no more attain truth, than frogs can fly.\r\n\r\nI reduce to two the systems of philosophy which deal with man's\r\nsoul. The first and older system is materialism; the second is\r\nspiritualism.\r\n\r\nThe metaphysicians who have hinted that matter may well be endowed\r\nwith the faculty of thought{1} have perhaps not reasoned ill. For\r\nthere is in this case a certain advantage in their inadequate way of\r\nexpressing their meaning. In truth, to ask whether matter can think,\r\nwithout considering it otherwise than in itself, is like asking\r\nwhether matter can tell time. It may be foreseen that we shall avoid\r\nthis reef upon which Locke had the bad luck to make shipwreck.\r\n\r\nThe Leibnizians with their monads have set up an unintelligible\r\nhypothesis. They have rather spiritualized matter than materialized\r\nthe soul. How can we define a being whose nature is absolutely unknown\r\nto us?{2}\r\n\r\nDescartes and all the Cartesians, among whom the followers of\r\nMalebranche have long been numbered, have made the same mistake. They\r\nhave taken for granted two distinct substances in man, as if they\r\nhad seen them, and positively counted them.\r\n\r\nThe wisest men have declared that the soul can not know itself save by\r\nthe light of faith. However, as reasonable beings they have thought\r\nthat they could reserve for themselves the right of examining what\r\nthe Bible means by the word \"spirit,\" which it uses in speaking of\r\nthe human soul. And if in their investigation, they do not agree with\r\nthe theologians on this point, are the theologians more in agreement\r\namong themselves on all other points?\r\n\r\nHere is the result in a few words, of all their reflections. If there\r\nis a God, He is the Author of nature as well as of revelation. He has\r\ngiven us the one to explain the other, and reason to make them agree.\r\n\r\nTo distrust the knowledge that can be drawn from the study of animated\r\nbodies, is to regard nature and revelation as two contraries which\r\ndestroy each the other, and consequently to dare uphold the absurd\r\ndoctrine, that God contradicts Himself in His various works and\r\ndeceives us.\r\n\r\nIf there is a revelation, it can not then contradict nature. By nature\r\nonly can we understand the meaning of the words of the Gospel, of which\r\nexperience is the only true interpreter. In fact, the commentators\r\nbefore our time have only obscured the truth. We can judge of this\r\nby the author of the \"Spectacle of Nature.\"{3} \"It is astonishing,\"\r\nhe says concerning Locke, \"that a man who degrades our soul far\r\nenough to consider it a soul of clay should dare set up reason as\r\njudge and sovereign arbiter of the mysteries of faith, for,\" he adds,\r\n\"what an astonishing idea of Christianity one would have, if one were\r\nto follow reason.\"\r\n\r\nNot only do these reflections fail to elucidate faith, but they also\r\nconstitute such frivolous objections to the method of those who\r\nundertake to interpret the Scripture, that I am almost ashamed to\r\nwaste time in refuting them.\r\n\r\nThe excellence of reason does not depend on a big word devoid of\r\nmeaning (immateriality), but on the force, extent, and perspicuity\r\nof reason itself. Thus a \"soul of clay\" which should discover,\r\nat one glance, as it were, the relations and the consequences of\r\nan infinite number of ideas hard to understand, would evidently be\r\npreferable to a foolish and stupid soul, though that were composed\r\nof the most precious elements. A man is not a philosopher because,\r\nwith Pliny, he blushes over the wretchedness of our origin. What\r\nseems vile is here the most precious of things, and seems to be the\r\nobject of nature's highest art and most elaborate care. But as man,\r\neven though he should come from an apparently still more lowly source,\r\nwould yet be the most perfect of all beings, so whatever the origin\r\nof his soul, if it is pure, noble, and lofty, it is a beautiful soul\r\nwhich dignifies the man endowed with it.\r\n\r\nPluche's second way of reasoning seems vicious to me, even in his\r\nsystem, which smacks a little of fanaticism; for [on his view] if we\r\nhave an idea of faith as being contrary to the clearest principles,\r\nto the most incontestable truths, we must yet conclude, out of respect\r\nfor revelation and its author, that this conception is false, and\r\nthat we do not yet understand the meaning of the words of the Gospel.\r\n\r\nOf the two alternatives, only one is possible: either everything\r\nis illusion, nature as well as revelation, or experience alone can\r\nexplain faith. But what can be more ridiculous than the position of\r\nour author! Can one imagine hearing a Peripatetic say, \"We ought not\r\nto accept the experiments of Torricelli,{4} for if we should accept\r\nthem, if we should rid ourselves of the horror of the void, what an\r\nastonishing philosophy we should have!\"\r\n\r\nI have shown how vicious the reasoning of Pluche is [10] in order to\r\nprove, in the first place, that if there is a revelation, it is not\r\nsufficiently demonstrated by the mere authority of the Church, and\r\nwithout any appeal to reason, as all those who fear reason claim: and\r\nin the second place, to protect against all assault the method of those\r\nwho would wish to follow the path that I open to them, of interpreting\r\nsupernatural things, incomprehensible in themselves, in the light\r\nof those ideas with which nature has endowed us. Experience and\r\nobservation should therefore be our only guides here. Both are to be\r\nfound throughout the records of the physicians who were philosophers,\r\nand not in the works of the philosophers who were not physicians. The\r\nformer have traveled through and illuminated the labyrinth of man; they\r\nalone have laid bare to us those springs [of life] hidden under the\r\nexternal integument which conceals so many wonders from our eyes. They\r\nalone, tranquilly contemplating our soul, have surprised it, a thousand\r\ntimes, both in its wretchedness and in its glory, and they have no\r\nmore despised it in the first estate, than they have admired it in the\r\nsecond. Thus, to repeat, only the physicians have a right to speak on\r\nthis subject.{5} What could the others, especially the theologians,\r\nhave to say? Is it not ridiculous to hear them shamelessly coming to\r\nconclusions about a subject concerning which they have had no means\r\nof knowing anything, and from which on the contrary they have been\r\ncompletely turned aside by obscure studies that have led them to a\r\nthousand prejudiced opinions,--in a word, to fanaticism, which adds\r\nyet more to their ignorance of the mechanism of the body?\r\n\r\nBut even though we have chosen the best guides, we shall still find\r\nmany thorns and stumbling blocks in the way.\r\n\r\nMan is so complicated a machine{6} that it is impossible to get a\r\nclear idea of the machine beforehand, and hence impossible to define\r\nit. For this reason, all the investigations have been vain, which the\r\ngreatest philosophers have made à priori, that is to say, in so far\r\nas they use, as it were, the wings of the spirit. Thus it is only à\r\nposteriori or by trying to disentangle the soul from the organs of\r\nthe body, so to speak, that one can reach the highest probability\r\nconcerning man's own nature, even though one can not discover with\r\ncertainty what his nature is.\r\n\r\nLet us then take in our hands the staff of experience,{7} paying no\r\nheed to the accounts of all the idle theories of philosophers. To be\r\nblind and to think that one can do without this staff is the worst\r\nkind of blindness. How truly a contemporary writer says that only\r\nvanity fails to gather from secondary causes the same lessons as\r\nfrom primary causes! One can and one even ought to admire all these\r\nfine geniuses in their most useless works, such men as Descartes,\r\nMalebranche, Leibniz, Wolff and the rest, but what profit, I ask, has\r\nany one gained from their profound meditations, and from all their\r\nworks? Let us start out then to discover not what has been thought,\r\nbut what must be thought for the sake of repose in life.\r\n\r\nThere are as many different minds, different characters, and different\r\ncustoms, as there are different temperaments. Even Galen{8} knew this\r\ntruth which Descartes carried so far as to claim that medicine alone\r\ncan change minds and morals, along with bodies. (By the writer of\r\n\"L'histoire de l'âme,\"{9} this teaching is incorrectly attributed to\r\nHippocrates.{10}) It is true that melancholy, bile, phlegm, blood\r\netc.--according to the nature, the abundance, and the different\r\ncombination of these humors--make each man different from another.{11}\r\n\r\nIn disease the soul is sometimes hidden, showing no sign of life;\r\nsometimes it is so inflamed by fury that it seems to be doubled;\r\nsometimes, imbecility vanishes and the convalescence of an idiot\r\nproduces a wise man. Sometimes, again, the greatest genius becomes\r\nimbecile and loses the sense of self. Adieu then to all that fine\r\nknowledge, acquired at so high a price, and with so much trouble! Here\r\nis a paralytic who asks if his leg is in bed with him; there is\r\na soldier who thinks that he still has the arm which has been cut\r\noff. The memory of his old sensations, and of the place to which they\r\nwere referred by his soul, is the cause of his illusion, and of this\r\nkind of delirium. The mere mention of the member which he has lost is\r\nenough to recall it to his mind, and to make him feel all its motions;\r\nand this causes him an indefinable and inexpressible kind of imaginary\r\nsuffering. This man cries like a child at death's approach, while this\r\nother jests. What was needed to change the bravery of Caius Julius,\r\nSeneca, or Petronius into cowardice or faintheartedness? Merely\r\nan obstruction in the spleen, in the liver, an impediment in the\r\nportal vein? Why? Because the imagination is obstructed along with\r\nthe viscera, and this gives rise to all the singular phenomena of\r\nhysteria and hypochondria.\r\n\r\nWhat can I add to the stories already told of those who imagine\r\nthemselves transformed into wolf-men, cocks or vampires, or of those\r\nwho think that the dead feed upon them? Why should I stop to speak\r\nof the man who imagines that his nose or some other member is of\r\nglass? The way to help this man regain his faculties and his own\r\nflesh-and-blood nose is to advise him to sleep on hay, lest he break\r\nthe fragile organ, and then to set fire to the hay that he may be\r\nafraid of being burned--a fear which has sometimes cured paralysis. But\r\nI must touch lightly on facts which everybody knows.\r\n\r\nNeither shall I dwell long on the details of the effects of sleep. Here\r\na tired soldier snores in a trench, in the middle of the thunder of\r\nhundreds of cannon. His soul hears nothing; his sleep is as deep as\r\napoplexy. A bomb is on the point of crushing him. He will feel this\r\nless perhaps than he feels an insect which is under his foot.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this man who is devoured by jealousy, hatred,\r\navarice, or ambition, can never find any rest. The most peaceful spot,\r\nthe freshest and most calming drinks are alike useless to one who\r\nhas not freed his heart from the torment of passion.\r\n\r\nThe soul and the body fall asleep together. As the motion of the\r\nblood is calmed, a sweet feeling of peace and quiet spreads through\r\nthe whole mechanism. The soul feels itself little by little growing\r\nheavy as the eyelids droop, and loses its tenseness, as the fibres\r\nof the brain relax; thus little by little it becomes as if paralyzed\r\nand with it all the muscles of the body. These can no longer sustain\r\nthe weight of the head, and the soul can no longer bear the burden\r\nof thought; it is in sleep as if it were not.\r\n\r\nIs the circulation too quick? the soul can not sleep. Is the soul\r\ntoo much excited? the blood can not be quieted: it gallops through\r\nthe veins with an audible murmur. Such are the two opposite causes\r\nof insomnia. A single fright in the midst of our dreams makes the\r\nheart beat at double speed and snatches us from needed and delicious\r\nrepose, as a real grief or an urgent need would do. Lastly as the\r\nmere cessation of the functions of the soul produces sleep, there\r\nare, even when we are awake (or at least when we are half awake),\r\nkinds of very frequent short naps of the mind, vergers' dreams, which\r\nshow that the soul does not always wait for the body to sleep. For\r\nif the soul is not fast asleep, it surely is not far from sleep,\r\nsince it can not point out a single object to which it has attended,\r\namong the uncounted number of confused ideas which, so to speak,\r\nfill the atmosphere of our brains like clouds.\r\n\r\nOpium is too closely related to the sleep it produces, to be left\r\nout of consideration here. This drug intoxicates, like wine, coffee,\r\netc., each in its own measure and according to the dose.{12} It makes\r\na man happy in a state which would seemingly be the tomb of feeling,\r\nas it is the image of death. How sweet is this lethargy! The soul\r\nwould long never to emerge from it. For the soul has been a prey to\r\nthe most intense sorrow, but now feels only the joy of suffering past,\r\nand of sweetest peace. Opium even alters the will, forcing the soul\r\nwhich wished to wake and to enjoy life, to sleep in spite of itself. I\r\nshall omit any reference to the effect of poisons.\r\n\r\nCoffee, the well-known antidote for wine, by scourging the imagination,\r\ncures our headaches and scatters our cares without laying up for us,\r\nas wine does, other headaches for the morrow. But let us contemplate\r\nthe soul in its other needs.\r\n\r\nThe human body is a machine which winds its own springs. It is\r\nthe living image of perpetual movement. Nourishment keeps up the\r\nmovements which fever excites. Without food, the soul pines away,\r\ngoes mad, and dies exhausted. The soul is a taper whose light flares\r\nup the moment before it goes out. But nourish the body, pour into\r\nits veins life-giving juices and strong liquors, and then the soul\r\ngrows strong like them, as if arming itself with a proud courage,\r\nand the soldier whom water would have made flee, grows bold and runs\r\njoyously to death to the sound of drums. Thus a hot drink sets into\r\nstormy movement the blood which a cold drink would have calmed.\r\n\r\nWhat power there is in a meal! Joy revives in a sad heart, and infects\r\nthe souls of comrades, who express their delight in the friendly songs\r\nin which the Frenchman excels. The melancholy man alone is dejected,\r\nand the studious man is equally out of place [in such company].\r\n\r\nRaw meat makes animals fierce, and it would have the same effect on\r\nman. This is so true that the English who eat meat red and bloody,\r\nand not as well done as ours, seem to share more or less in the\r\nsavagery due to this kind of food, and to other causes which can be\r\nrendered ineffective by education only. This savagery creates in the\r\nsoul, pride, hatred, scorn of other nations, indocility and other\r\nsentiments which degrade the character, just as heavy food makes a\r\ndull and heavy mind whose usual traits are laziness and indolence.\r\n\r\nPope understood well the full power of greediness when he said:{13}\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Catius is ever moral, ever grave,\r\n    Thinks who endures a knave is next a knave,\r\n    Save just at dinner--then prefers no doubt,\r\n    A rogue with ven'son to a saint without.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nElsewhere he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"See the same man in vigor, in the gout\r\n    Alone, in company, in place or out,\r\n    Early at business and at hazard late,\r\n    Mad at a fox chase, wise at a debate,\r\n    Drunk at a borough, civil at a ball,\r\n    Friendly at Hackney, faithless at White Hall.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Switzerland we had a bailiff by the name of M. Steigner de\r\nWittighofen. When he fasted he was a most upright and even a most\r\nindulgent judge, but woe to the unfortunate man whom he found on the\r\nculprit's bench after he had had a large dinner! He was capable of\r\nsending the innocent like the guilty to the gallows.\r\n\r\nWe think we are, and in fact we are, good men, only as we are gay or\r\nbrave; everything depends on the way our machine is running. One is\r\nsometimes inclined to say that the soul is situated in the stomach,\r\nand that Van Helmont,{14} who said that the seat of the soul was in\r\nthe pylorus, made only the mistake of taking the part for the whole.\r\n\r\nTo what excesses cruel hunger can bring us! We no longer regard even\r\nour own parents and children. We tear them to pieces eagerly and make\r\nhorrible banquets of them; and in the fury with which we are carried\r\naway, the weakest is always the prey of the strongest....\r\n\r\nOne needs only eyes to see the necessary influence of old age on\r\nreason. The soul follows the progress of the body, as it does the\r\nprogress of education. In the weaker sex, the soul accords also with\r\ndelicacy of temperament, and from this delicacy follow tenderness,\r\naffection, quick feelings due more to passion than to reason,\r\nprejudices, and superstitions, whose strong impress can hardly be\r\neffaced. Man, on the other hand, whose brain and nerves partake of\r\nthe firmness of all solids, has not only stronger features but also a\r\nmore vigorous mind. Education, which women lack, strengthens his mind\r\nstill more. Thus with such help of nature and art, why should not\r\na man be more grateful, more generous, more constant in friendship,\r\nstronger in adversity? But, to follow almost exactly the thought of\r\nthe author of the \"Lettres sur la Physiognomie,\"{15} the sex which\r\nunites the charms of the mind and of the body with almost all the\r\ntenderest and most delicate feelings of the heart, should not envy\r\nus the two capacities which seem to have been given to man, the one\r\nmerely to enable him better to fathom the allurements of beauty,\r\nand the other merely to enable him to minister better to its pleasures.\r\n\r\nIt is no more necessary to be just as great a physiognomist as this\r\nauthor, in order to guess the quality of the mind from the countenance\r\nor the shape of the features, provided these are sufficiently marked,\r\nthan it is necessary to be a great doctor to recognize a disease\r\naccompanied by all its marked symptoms. Look at the portraits of Locke,\r\nof Steele, of Boerhaave,{16} of Maupertuis,{17} and the rest, and\r\nyou will not be surprised to find strong faces and eagle eyes. Look\r\nover a multitude of others, and you can always distinguish the man\r\nof talent from the man of genius, and often even an honest man from\r\na scoundrel. For example, it has been noticed that a celebrated poet\r\ncombines (in his portrait) the look of a pickpocket with the fire\r\nof Prometheus.\r\n\r\nHistory provides us with a noteworthy example of the power of\r\ntemperature. The famous Duke of Guise was so strongly convinced that\r\nHenry the Third, in whose power he had so often been, would never dare\r\nassassinate him, that he went to Blois. When the Chancelor Chiverny\r\nlearned of the duke's departure, he cried, \"He is lost.\" After this\r\nfatal prediction had been fulfilled by the event, Chiverny was asked\r\nwhy he made it. \"I have known the king for twenty years,\" said he;\r\n\"he is naturally kind and even weakly indulgent, but I have noticed\r\nthat when it is cold, it takes nothing at all to provoke him and send\r\nhim into a passion.\"\r\n\r\nOne nation is of heavy and stupid wit, and another quick, light and\r\npenetrating. Whence comes this difference, if not in part from the\r\ndifference in foods, and difference in inheritance, [11] and in part\r\nfrom the mixture of the diverse elements which float around in the\r\nimmensity of the void? The mind, like the body, has its contagious\r\ndiseases and its scurvy.\r\n\r\nSuch is the influence of climate, that a man who goes from one climate\r\nto another, feels the change, in spite of himself. He is a walking\r\nplant which has transplanted itself; if the climate is not the same,\r\nit will surely either degenerate or improve.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we catch everything from those with whom we come in\r\ncontact; their gestures, their accent, etc.; just as the eyelid is\r\ninstinctively lowered when a blow is foreseen, or as (for the same\r\nreason) the body of the spectator mechanically imitates, in spite of\r\nhimself, all the motions of a good mimic.{18}\r\n\r\nFrom what I have just said, it follows that a brilliant man is\r\nhis own best company, unless he can find other company of the same\r\nsort. In the society of the unintelligent, the mind grows rusty for\r\nlack of exercise, as at tennis a ball that is served badly is badly\r\nreturned. I should prefer an intelligent man without an education,\r\nif he were still young enough, to a man badly educated. A badly\r\ntrained mind is like an actor whom the provinces have spoiled.\r\n\r\nThus, the diverse states of the soul are always correlative with\r\nthose of the body.{19} But the better to show this dependence, in\r\nits completeness and its causes, let us here make use of comparative\r\nanatomy; let us lay bare the organs of man and of animals. How can\r\nhuman nature be known, if we may not derive any light from an exact\r\ncomparison of the structure of man and of animals?\r\n\r\nIn general, the form and the structure of the brains of quadrupeds\r\nare almost the same as those of the brain of man; the same shape,\r\nthe same arrangement everywhere, with this essential difference,\r\nthat of all the animals man is the one whose brain is largest, and,\r\nin proportion to its mass, more convoluted than the brain of any\r\nother animal; then come the monkey, the beaver, the elephant, the\r\ndog, the fox, the cat. These animals are most like man, for among\r\nthem, too, one notes the same progressive analogy in relation to\r\nthe corpus callosum in which Lancisi--anticipating the late M. de la\r\nPeyronie{20}--established the seat of the soul. The latter, however,\r\nillustrated the theory by innumerable experiments. Next after all the\r\nquadrupeds, birds have the largest brains. Fish have large heads,\r\nbut these are void of sense, like the heads of many men. Fish have\r\nno corpus callosum, and very little brain, while insects entirely\r\nlack brain.\r\n\r\nI shall not launch out into any more detail about the varieties\r\nof nature, nor into conjectures concerning them, for there is an\r\ninfinite number of both, as any one can see by reading no further\r\nthan the treatises of Willis \"De Cerebro\" and \"De Anima Brutorum.\"{21}\r\n\r\nI shall draw the conclusions which follow clearly from these\r\nincontestable observations: 1st, that the fiercer animals are, the\r\nless brain they have; 2d, that this organ seems to increase in size\r\nin proportion to the gentleness of the animal; 3d, that nature seems\r\nhere eternally to impose a singular condition, that the more one gains\r\nin intelligence the more one loses in instinct. Does this bring gain\r\nor loss?\r\n\r\nDo not think, however, that I wish to infer by that, that the size\r\nalone of the brain, is enough to indicate the degree of tameness in\r\nanimals: the quality must correspond to the quantity, and the solids\r\nand liquids must be in that due equilibrium which constitutes health.\r\n\r\nIf, as is ordinarily observed, the imbecile does not lack brain, his\r\nbrain will be deficient in its consistency--for instance, in being too\r\nsoft. The same thing is true of the insane, and the defects of their\r\nbrains do not always escape our investigation. But if the causes of\r\nimbecility, insanity, etc., are not obvious, where shall we look for\r\nthe causes of the diversity of all minds? They would escape the eyes\r\nof a lynx and of an argus. A mere nothing, a tiny fibre, something\r\nthat could never be found by the most delicate anatomy, would have\r\nmade of Erasmus and Fontenelle{22} two idiots, and Fontenelle himself\r\nspeaks of this very fact in one of his best dialogues.\r\n\r\nWillis has noticed in addition to the softness of the brain-substance\r\nin children, puppies, and birds, that the corpora striata are\r\nobliterated and discolored in all these animals, and that the\r\nstriations are as imperfectly formed as in paralytics....\r\n\r\nHowever cautious and reserved one may be about the consequences\r\nthat can be deduced from these observations, and from many others\r\nconcerning the kind of variation in the organs, nerves, etc.,\r\n[one must admit that] so many different varieties can not be the\r\ngratuitous play of nature. They prove at least the necessity for a\r\ngood and vigorous physical organization, since throughout the animal\r\nkingdom the soul gains force with the body and acquires keenness,\r\nas the body gains strength.\r\n\r\nLet us pause to contemplate the varying capacity of animals to\r\nlearn. Doubtless the analogy best framed leads the mind to think\r\nthat the causes we have mentioned produce all the difference that is\r\nfound between animals and men, although we must confess that our weak\r\nunderstanding, limited to the coarsest observations, can not see the\r\nbonds that exist between cause and effects. This is a kind of harmony\r\nthat philosophers will never know.\r\n\r\nAmong animals, some learn to speak and sing; they remember tunes,\r\nand strike the notes as exactly as a musician. Others, for instance\r\nthe ape, show more intelligence, and yet can not learn music. What is\r\nthe reason for this, except some defect in the organs of speech? But\r\nis this defect so essential to the structure that it could never be\r\nremedied? In a word, would it be absolutely impossible to teach the\r\nape a language?{23} I do not think so.\r\n\r\nI should choose a large ape in preference to any other, until by\r\nsome good fortune another kind should be discovered, more like us,\r\nfor nothing prevents there being such an one in regions unknown to\r\nus. The ape resembles us so strongly that naturalists have called it\r\n\"wild man\" or \"man of the woods.\" I should take it in the condition\r\nof the pupils of Amman,{24} that is to say, I should not want it to be\r\ntoo young or too old; for apes that are brought to Europe are usually\r\ntoo old. I would choose the one with the most intelligent face, and\r\nthe one which, in a thousand little ways, best lived up to its look of\r\nintelligence. Finally not considering myself worthy to be his master,\r\nI should put him in the school of that excellent teacher whom I have\r\njust named, or with another teacher equally skilful, if there is one.\r\n\r\nYou know by Amman's work, and by all those [12] who have interpreted\r\nhis method, all the wonders he has been able to accomplish for those\r\nborn deaf. In their eyes he discovered ears, as he himself explains,\r\nand in how short a time! In short he taught them to hear, speak,\r\nread, and write. I grant that a deaf person's eyes see more clearly\r\nand are keener than if he were not deaf, for the loss of one member\r\nor sense can increase the strength or acuteness of another, but apes\r\nsee and hear, they understand what they hear and see, and grasp so\r\nperfectly the signs that are made to them, that I doubt not that they\r\nwould surpass the pupils of Amman in any other game or exercise. Why\r\nthen should the education of monkeys be impossible? Why might not\r\nthe monkey, by dint of great pains, at last imitate after the manner\r\nof deaf mutes, the motions necessary for pronunciation? I do not\r\ndare decide whether the monkey's organs of speech, however trained,\r\nwould be incapable of articulation. But, because of the great analogy\r\nbetween ape and man{25} and because there is no known animal whose\r\nexternal and internal organs so strikingly resemble man's, it would\r\nsurprise me if speech were absolutely impossible to the ape. Locke,\r\nwho was certainly never suspected of credulity, found no difficulty\r\nin believing the story told by Sir William Temple{26} in his memoirs,\r\nabout a parrot which could answer rationally, and which had learned\r\nto carry on a kind of connected conversation, as we do. I know that\r\npeople have ridiculed [13] this great metaphysician; but suppose some\r\none should have announced that reproduction sometimes takes place\r\nwithout eggs or a female, would he have found many partisans? Yet\r\nM. Trembley{27} has found cases where reproduction takes place without\r\ncopulation and by fission. Would not Amman too have passed for mad if\r\nhe had boasted that he could instruct scholars like his in so short\r\na time, before he had happily accomplished the feat? His successes\r\nhave, however, astonished the world; and he, like the author of \"The\r\nHistory of Polyps,\" has risen to immortality at one bound. Whoever\r\nowes the miracles that he works to his own genius surpasses, in\r\nmy opinion, the man who owes his to chance. He who has discovered\r\nthe art of adorning the most beautiful of the kingdoms [of nature],\r\nand of giving it perfections that it did not have, should be rated\r\nabove an idle creator of frivolous systems, or a painstaking author\r\nof sterile discoveries. Amman's discoveries are certainly of a much\r\ngreater value; he has freed men from the instinct to which they seemed\r\nto be condemned, and has given them ideas, intelligence, or in a word,\r\na soul which they would never have had. What greater power than this!\r\n\r\nLet us not limit the resources of nature; they are infinite, especially\r\nwhen reinforced by great art.\r\n\r\nCould not the device which opens the Eustachian canal of the deaf,\r\nopen that of apes? Might not a happy desire to imitate the master's\r\npronunciation, liberate the organs of speech in animals that imitate\r\nso many other signs with such skill and intelligence? Not only do I\r\ndefy any one to name any really conclusive experiment which proves my\r\nview impossible and absurd; but such is the likeness of the structure\r\nand functions of the ape to ours that I have very little doubt that\r\nif this animal were properly trained he might at last be taught to\r\npronounce, and consequently to know, a language. Then he would no\r\nlonger be a wild man, nor a defective man, but he would be a perfect\r\nman, a little gentleman, with as much matter or muscle as we have,\r\nfor thinking and profiting by his education.\r\n\r\nThe transition from animals to man is not violent, as true philosophers\r\nwill admit. What was man before the invention of words and the\r\nknowledge of language?{28} An animal of his own species with much\r\nless instinct than the others. In those days, he did not consider\r\nhimself king over the other animals, nor was he distinguished from\r\nthe ape, and from the rest, except as the ape itself differs from the\r\nother animals, i. e., by a more intelligent face. Reduced to the bare\r\nintuitive knowledge of the Leibnizians he saw only shapes and colors,\r\nwithout being able to distinguish between them: the same, old as young,\r\nchild at all ages, he lisped out his sensations and his needs, as a\r\ndog that is hungry or tired of sleeping, asks for something to eat,\r\nor for a walk.\r\n\r\nWords, languages, laws, sciences, and the fine arts have come, and by\r\nthem finally the rough diamond of our mind has been polished. Man has\r\nbeen trained in the same way as animals. He has become an author,\r\nas they became beasts of burden. A geometrician has learned to\r\nperform the most difficult demonstrations and calculations, as a\r\nmonkey has learned to take his little hat off and on, and to mount his\r\ntame dog. All has been accomplished through signs, every species has\r\nlearned what it could understand, and in this way men have acquired\r\nsymbolic knowledge, still so called by our German philosophers.\r\n\r\nNothing, as any one can see, is so simple as the mechanism of our\r\neducation. Everything may be reduced to sounds or words that pass from\r\nthe mouth of one through the ears of another into his brain. At the\r\nsame moment, he perceives through his eyes the shape of the bodies\r\nof which these words are the arbitrary signs.\r\n\r\nBut who was the first to speak? Who was the first teacher of the\r\nhuman race? Who invented the means of utilizing the plasticity of our\r\norganism? I can not answer: the names of these first splendid geniuses\r\nhave been lost in the night of time. But art is the child of nature,\r\nso nature must have long preceded it.\r\n\r\nWe must think that the men who were the most highly organized, those\r\non whom nature had lavished her richest gifts, taught the others. They\r\ncould not have heard a new sound for instance, nor experienced new\r\nsensations, nor been struck by all the varied and beautiful objects\r\nthat compose the ravishing spectacle of nature without finding\r\nthemselves in the state of mind of the deaf man of Chartres, whose\r\nexperience was first related by the great Fontenelle,{29} when,\r\nat forty years, he heard for the first time, the astonishing sound\r\nof bells.\r\n\r\nWould it be absurd to conclude from this that the first mortals tried\r\nafter the manner of this deaf man, or like animals and like mutes\r\n(another kind of animals), to express their new feelings by motions\r\ndepending on the nature of their imagination, and therefore afterwards\r\nby spontaneous sounds, distinctive of each animal, as the natural\r\nexpression of their surprise, their joy, their ecstasies and their\r\nneeds? For doubtless those whom nature endowed with finer feeling\r\nhad also greater facility in expression.\r\n\r\nThat is the way in which, I think, men have used their feeling and\r\ntheir instinct to gain intelligence and then have employed their\r\nintelligence to gain knowledge. Those are the ways, so far as I can\r\nunderstand them, in which men have filled the brain with the ideas,\r\nfor the reception of which nature made it. Nature and man have helped\r\neach other; and the smallest beginnings have, little by little,\r\nincreased, until everything in the universe could be as easily\r\ndescribed as a circle.\r\n\r\nAs a violin string or a harpsichord key vibrates and gives forth sound,\r\nso the cerebral fibres, struck by waves of sound, are stimulated to\r\nrender or repeat the words that strike them. And as the structure\r\nof the brain is such that when eyes well formed for seeing, have\r\nonce perceived the image of objects, the brain can not help seeing\r\ntheir images and their differences, so when the signs of these\r\ndifferences have been traced or imprinted in the brain, the soul\r\nnecessarily examines their relations--an examination that would have\r\nbeen impossible without the discovery of signs or the invention of\r\nlanguage. At the time when the universe was almost dumb, the soul's\r\nattitude toward all objects was that of a man without any idea of\r\nproportion toward a picture or a piece of sculpture, in which he could\r\ndistinguish nothing; or the soul was like a little child (for the\r\nsoul was then in its infancy) who, holding in his hand small bits of\r\nstraw or wood, sees them in a vague and superficial way without being\r\nable to count or distinguish them. But let some one attach a kind of\r\nbanner, or standard, to this bit of wood (which perhaps is called a\r\nmast), and another banner to another similar object; let the first\r\nbe known by the symbol 1, and the second by the symbol or number 2,\r\nthen the child will be able to count the objects, and in this way he\r\nwill learn all of arithmetic. As soon as one figure seems equal to\r\nanother in its numerical sign, he will decide without difficulty that\r\nthey are two different bodies, that 1 + 1 make 2, and 2 + 2 make 4,\r\n[14] etc.\r\n\r\nThis real or apparent likeness of figures is the fundamental basis of\r\nall truths and of all we know. Among these sciences, evidently those\r\nwhose signs are less simple and less sensible are harder to understand\r\nthan the others, because more talent is required to comprehend and\r\ncombine the immense number of words by which such sciences express\r\nthe truths in their province. On the other hand, the sciences that\r\nare expressed by numbers or by other small signs, are easily learned;\r\nand without doubt this facility rather than its demonstrability is\r\nwhat has made the fortune of algebra.\r\n\r\nAll this knowledge, with which vanity fills the balloon-like brains of\r\nour proud pedants, is therefore but a huge mass of words and figures,\r\nwhich form in the brain all the marks by which we distinguish and\r\nrecall objects. All our ideas are awakened after the fashion in which\r\nthe gardener who knows plants recalls all stages of their growth at\r\nsight of them. These words and the objects designated by them are\r\nso connected in the brain that it is comparatively rare to imagine\r\na thing without the name or sign that is attached to it.\r\n\r\nI always use the word \"imagine,\" because I think that everything is\r\nthe work of imagination, and that all the faculties of the soul can be\r\ncorrectly reduced to pure imagination in which they all consist.{30}\r\nThus judgment, reason, and memory are not absolute parts of the soul,\r\nbut merely modifications of this kind of medullary screen upon which\r\nimages of the objects painted in the eye are projected as by a magic\r\nlantern.\r\n\r\nBut if such is the marvelous and incomprehensible result of the\r\nstructure of the brain, if everything is perceived and explained\r\nby imagination, why should we divide the sensitive principle which\r\nthinks in man? Is not this a clear inconsistency in the partisans\r\nof the simplicity of the mind? For a thing that is divided can no\r\nlonger without absurdity be regarded as indivisible. See to what one is\r\nbrought by the abuse of language and by those fine words (spirituality,\r\nimmateriality, etc.) used haphazard and not understood even by the\r\nmost brilliant.{31}\r\n\r\nNothing is easier than to prove a system based, as this one is, on\r\nthe intimate feeling and personal experience of each individual. If\r\nthe imagination, or, let us say, that fantastic part of the brain\r\nwhose nature is as unknown to us as its way of acting, be naturally\r\nsmall or weak, it will hardly be able to compare the analogy or the\r\nresemblance of its ideas, it will be able to see only what is face\r\nto face with it, or what affects it very strongly; and how will it\r\nsee all this! Yet it is always imagination which apperceives, and\r\nimagination which represents to itself all objects along with their\r\nnames and symbols; and thus, once again, imagination is the soul,\r\nsince it plays all the rôles of the soul. By the imagination, by its\r\nflattering brush, the cold skeleton of reason takes on living and ruddy\r\nflesh, by the imagination the sciences flourish, the arts are adorned,\r\nthe wood speaks, the echoes sigh, the rocks weep, marble breathes, and\r\nall inanimate objects gain life. It is imagination again which adds\r\nthe piquant charm of voluptuousness to the tenderness of an amorous\r\nheart; which makes tenderness bud in the study of the philosopher\r\nand of the dusty pedant, which, in a word, creates scholars as well\r\nas orators and poets. Foolishly decried by some, vainly praised by\r\nothers, and misunderstood by all; it follows not only in the train\r\nof the graces and of the fine arts, it not only describes, but can\r\nalso measure nature. It reasons, judges, analyzes, compares, and\r\ninvestigates. Could it feel so keenly the beauties of the pictures\r\ndrawn for it, unless it discovered their relations? No, just as it can\r\nnot turn its thoughts on the pleasures of the senses, without enjoying\r\ntheir perfection or their voluptuousness, it can not reflect on what\r\nit has mechanically conceived, without thus being judgment itself.\r\n\r\nThe more the imagination or the poorest talent is exercised, the\r\nmore it gains in embonpoint, so to speak, and the larger it grows. It\r\nbecomes sensitive, robust, broad, and capable of thinking. The best\r\nof organisms has need of this exercise.\r\n\r\nMan's preeminent advantage is his organism.{32} In vain all writers\r\nof books on morals fail to regard as praiseworthy those qualities\r\nthat come by nature, esteeming only the talents gained by dint of\r\nreflection and industry. For whence come, I ask, skill, learning,\r\nand virtue, if not from a disposition that makes us fit to become\r\nskilful, wise and virtuous? And whence again, comes this disposition,\r\nif not from nature? Only through nature do we have any good qualities;\r\nto her we owe all that we are. Why then should I not esteem men with\r\ngood natural qualities as much as men who shine by acquired and as\r\nit were borrowed virtues? Whatever the virtue may be, from whatever\r\nsource it may come, it is worthy of esteem; the only question is,\r\nhow to estimate it. Mind, beauty, wealth, nobility, although the\r\nchildren of chance, all have their own value, as skill, learning and\r\nvirtue have theirs. Those upon whom nature has heaped her most costly\r\ngifts should pity those to whom these gifts have been refused; but,\r\nin their character of experts, they may feel their superiority without\r\npride. A beautiful woman would be as foolish to think herself ugly,\r\nas an intelligent man to think himself a fool. An exaggerated modesty\r\n(a rare fault, to be sure) is a kind of ingratitude towards nature. An\r\nhonest pride, on the contrary, is the mark of a strong and beautiful\r\nsoul, revealed by manly features moulded by feeling.\r\n\r\nIf one's organism is an advantage, and the preeminent advantage,\r\nand the source of all others, education is the second. The best made\r\nbrain would be a total loss without it, just as the best constituted\r\nman would be but a common peasant, without knowledge of the ways of\r\nthe world. But, on the other hand, what would be the use of the most\r\nexcellent school, without a matrix perfectly open to the entrance and\r\nconception of ideas? It is ... impossible to impart a single idea to\r\na man deprived of all his senses....\r\n\r\nBut if the brain is at the same time well organized and well educated,\r\nit is a fertile soil, well sown, that brings forth a hundredfold\r\nwhat it has received: or (to leave the figures of speech often\r\nneeded to express what one means, and to add grace to truth itself)\r\nthe imagination, raised by art to the rare and beautiful dignity\r\nof genius, apprehends exactly all the relations of the ideas it has\r\nconceived, and takes in easily an astounding number of objects, in\r\norder to deduce from them a long chain of consequences, which are\r\nagain but new relations, produced by a comparison with the first,\r\nto which the soul finds a perfect resemblance. Such is, I think, the\r\ngeneration of intelligence.{33} I say \"finds\" as I before gave the\r\nepithet \"apparent\" to the likeness of objects, not because I think that\r\nour senses are always deceivers, as Father Malebranche has claimed,\r\nor that our eyes, naturally a little unsteady, fail to see objects as\r\nthey are in themselves, (though microscopes prove this to us every\r\nday) but in order to avoid any dispute with the Pyrrhonians,{34}\r\namong whom Bayle{35} is well known.\r\n\r\nI say of truth in general what M. de Fontenelle says of certain\r\ntruths in particular, that we must sacrifice it in order to remain\r\non good terms with society. And it accords with the gentleness of\r\nmy character, to avoid all disputes unless to whet conversation. The\r\nCartesians would here in vain make an onset upon me with their innate\r\nideas. I certainly would not give myself a quarter of the trouble\r\nthat M. Locke took, to attack such chimeras. In truth, what is the\r\nuse of writing a ponderous volume to prove a doctrine which became\r\nan axiom three thousand years ago?\r\n\r\nAccording to the principles which we have laid down, and which we\r\nconsider true; he who has the most imagination should be regarded\r\nas having the most intelligence or genius, for all these words are\r\nsynonymous; and again, only by a shameful abuse [of terms] do we\r\nthink that we are saying different things, when we are merely using\r\ndifferent words, different sounds, to which no idea or real distinction\r\nis attached.\r\n\r\nThe finest, greatest, or strongest imagination is then the one most\r\nsuited to the sciences as well as to the arts. I do not pretend to say\r\nwhether more intellect is necessary to excel in the art of Aristotle\r\nor of Descartes than to excel in that of Euripides or of Sophocles,\r\nand whether nature has taken more trouble to make Newton than to make\r\nCorneille, though I doubt this. But it is certain that imagination\r\nalone, differently applied, has produced their diverse triumphs and\r\ntheir immortal glory.\r\n\r\nIf one is known as having little judgment and much imagination, this\r\nmeans that the imagination has been left too much alone, has, as it\r\nwere, occupied most of the time in looking at itself in the mirror of\r\nits sensations, has not sufficiently formed the habit of examining the\r\nsensations themselves attentively. [It means that the imagination] has\r\nbeen more impressed by images than by their truth or their likeness.\r\n\r\nTruly, so quick are the responses of the imagination that if attention,\r\nthat key or mother of the sciences, does not do its part, imagination\r\ncan do little more than run over and skim its objects.\r\n\r\nSee that bird on the bough: it seems always ready to fly\r\naway. Imagination is like the bird, always carried onward by the\r\nturmoil of the blood and the animal spirits. One wave leaves a mark,\r\neffaced by the one that follows; the soul pursues it, often in vain:\r\nit must expect to regret the loss of that which it has not quickly\r\nenough seized and fixed. Thus, imagination, the true image of time,\r\nis being ceaselessly destroyed and renewed.\r\n\r\nSuch is the chaos and the continuous quick succession of our\r\nideas: they drive each other away even as one wave yields to\r\nanother. Therefore, if imagination does not, as it were, use one set\r\nof its muscles to maintain a kind of equilibrium with the fibres of\r\nthe brain, to keep its attention for a while upon an object that is on\r\nthe point of disappearing, and to prevent itself from contemplating\r\nprematurely another object--[unless the imagination does all this],\r\nit will never be worthy of the fine name of judgment. It will express\r\nvividly what it has perceived in the same fashion: it will create\r\norators, musicians, painters, poets, but never a single philosopher. On\r\nthe contrary, if the imagination be trained from childhood to bridle\r\nitself and to keep from being carried away by its own impetuosity--an\r\nimpetuosity which creates only brilliant enthusiasts--and to check,\r\nto restrain, its ideas, to examine them in all their aspects in\r\norder to see all sides of an object, then the imagination, ready in\r\njudgment, will comprehend the greatest possible sphere of objects,\r\nthrough reasoning; and its vivacity (always so good a sign in children,\r\nand only needing to be regulated by study and training) will be only\r\na far-seeing insight without which little progress can be made in\r\nthe sciences.\r\n\r\nSuch are the simple foundations upon which the edifice of logic has\r\nbeen reared. Nature has built these foundations for the whole human\r\nrace, but some have used them, while others have abused them.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all these advantages of man over animals, it is doing him\r\nhonor to place him in the same class. For, truly, up to a certain\r\nage, he is more of an animal than they, since at birth he has less\r\ninstinct. What animal would die of hunger in the midst of a river of\r\nmilk? Man alone. Like that child of olden time to whom a modern writer,\r\nrefers, following Arnobius,{36} he knows neither the foods suitable for\r\nhim, nor the water that can drown him, nor the fire that can reduce him\r\nto ashes. Light a wax candle for the first time under a child's eyes,\r\nand he will mechanically put his fingers in the flame as if to find\r\nout what is the new thing that he sees. It is at his own cost that\r\nhe will learn of the danger, but he will not be caught again. Or,\r\nput the child with an animal on a precipice, the child alone falls\r\noff; he drowns where the animal would save itself by swimming. At\r\nfourteen or fifteen years the child knows hardly anything of the\r\ngreat pleasures in store for him, in the reproduction of his species;\r\nwhen he is a youth, he does not know exactly how to behave in a game\r\nwhich nature teaches animals so quickly. He hides himself as if he\r\nwere ashamed of taking pleasure, and of having been made to be happy,\r\nwhile animals frankly glory in being cynics. Without education, they\r\nare without prejudices. For one more example, let us observe a dog and\r\na child who have lost their master on a highway: the child cries and\r\ndoes not know to what saint to pray, while the dog, better helped by\r\nhis sense of smell than the child by his reason, soon finds his master.\r\n\r\nThus nature made us to be lower than animals or at least to exhibit all\r\nthe more, because of that native inferiority, the wonderful efficacy\r\nof education which alone raises us from the level of the animals\r\nand lifts us above them. But shall we grant this same distinction to\r\nthe deaf and to the blind, to imbeciles, madmen, or savages, or to\r\nthose who have been brought up in the woods with animals; to those\r\nwho have lost their imagination through melancholia, or in short to\r\nall those animals in human form who give evidence of only the rudest\r\ninstinct? No, all these, men of body but not of mind, do not deserve\r\nto be classed by themselves.\r\n\r\nWe do not intend to hide from ourselves the arguments that can\r\nbe brought forward against our belief and in favor of a primitive\r\ndistinction between men and animals. Some say that there is in man\r\na natural law, a knowledge of good and evil, which has never been\r\nimprinted on the heart of animals.\r\n\r\nBut is this objection, or rather this assertion, based on\r\nobservation? Any assertion unfounded on observation may be rejected by\r\na philosopher. Have we ever had a single experience which convinces\r\nus that man alone has been enlightened by a ray denied all other\r\nanimals? If there is no such experience, we can no more know what\r\ngoes on in animals' minds or even in the minds of other men, than\r\nwe can help feeling what affects the inner part of our own being. We\r\nknow that we think, and feel remorse--an intimate feeling forces us to\r\nrecognize this only too well; but this feeling in us is insufficient to\r\nenable us to judge the remorse of others. That is why we have to take\r\nothers at their word, or judge them by the sensible and external signs\r\nwe have noticed in ourselves when we experienced the same accusations\r\nof conscience and the same torments.\r\n\r\nIn order to decide whether animals which do not talk have received the\r\nnatural law, we must, therefore, have recourse to those signs to which\r\nI have just referred, if any such exist. The facts seem to prove it. A\r\ndog that bit the master who was teasing it, seemed to repent a minute\r\nafterwards; it looked sad, ashamed, afraid to show itself, and seemed\r\nto confess its guilt by a crouching and downcast air. History offers\r\nus a famous example of a lion which would not devour a man abandoned\r\nto its fury, because it recognized him as its benefactor. How much\r\nmight it be wished that man himself always showed the same gratitude\r\nfor kindnesses, and the same respect for humanity! Then we should no\r\nlonger fear either ungrateful wretches, or wars which are the plague\r\nof the human race and the real executioners of the natural law.\r\n\r\nBut a being to which nature has given such a precocious and enlightened\r\ninstinct, which judges, combines, reasons, and deliberates as far\r\nas the sphere of its activity extends and permits, a being which\r\nfeels attachment because of benefits received, and which leaving a\r\nmaster who treats it badly goes to seek a better one, a being with\r\na structure like ours, which performs the same acts, has the same\r\npassions, the same griefs, the same pleasures, more or less intense\r\naccording to the sway of the imagination and the delicacy of the\r\nnervous organization--does not such a being show clearly that it\r\nknows its faults and ours, understands good and evil, and in a word,\r\nhas consciousness of what it does? Would its soul, which feels the\r\nsame joys, the same mortification and the same discomfiture which we\r\nfeel, remain utterly unmoved by disgust when it saw a fellow-creature\r\ntorn to bits, or when it had itself pitilessly dismembered this\r\nfellow-creature? If this be granted, it follows that the precious gift\r\nnow in question would not have been denied to animals: for since they\r\nshow us sure signs of repentance, as well as of intelligence, what\r\nis there absurd in thinking that beings, almost as perfect machines\r\nas ourselves, are, like us, made to understand and to feel nature?\r\n\r\nLet no one object that animals, for the most part, are savage\r\nbeasts, incapable of realizing the evil that they do; for do all men\r\ndiscriminate better between vice and virtue? There is ferocity in our\r\nspecies as well as in theirs. Men who are in the barbarous habit of\r\nbreaking the natural law are not tormented as much by it, as those who\r\ntransgress it for the first time, and who have not been hardened by\r\nthe force of habit. The same thing is true of animals as of men--both\r\nmay be more or less ferocious in temperament, and both become more\r\nso by living with others like themselves. But a gentle and peaceful\r\nanimal which lives among other animals of the same disposition and of\r\ngentle nurture, will be an enemy of blood and carnage; it will blush\r\ninternally at having shed blood. There is perhaps this difference,\r\nthat since among animals everything is sacrificed to their needs, to\r\ntheir pleasures, to the necessities of life, which they enjoy more\r\nthan we, their remorse apparently should not be as keen as ours,\r\nbecause we are not in the same state of necessity as they. Custom\r\nperhaps dulls and perhaps stifles remorse as well as pleasures.\r\n\r\nBut I will suppose for a moment that I am utterly mistaken in\r\nconcluding that almost all the world holds a wrong opinion on this\r\nsubject, while I alone am right. I will grant that animals, even\r\nthe best of them, do not know the difference between moral good and\r\nevil, that they have no recollection of the trouble taken for them,\r\nof the kindness done them, no realization of their own virtues. [I\r\nwill suppose], for instance, that this lion, to which I, like so many\r\nothers, have referred, does not remember at all that it refused to\r\nkill the man, abandoned to its fury, in a combat more inhuman than\r\none could find among lions, tigers and bears, put together. For our\r\ncompatriots fight, Swiss against Swiss, brother against brother,\r\nrecognize each other, and yet capture and kill each other without\r\nremorse, because a prince pays for the murder. I suppose in short\r\nthat the natural law has not been given animals. What will be the\r\nconsequences of this supposition? Man is not moulded from a costlier\r\nclay; nature has used but one dough, and has merely varied the\r\nleaven. Therefore if animals do not repent for having violated this\r\ninmost feeling which I am discussing, or rather if they absolutely\r\nlack it, man must necessarily be in the same condition. Farewell\r\nthen to the natural law and all the fine treatises published about\r\nit! The whole animal kingdom in general would be deprived of it. But,\r\nconversely, if man can not dispense with the belief that when health\r\npermits him to be himself, he always distinguishes the upright, humane,\r\nand virtuous, from those who are not humane, virtuous, nor honorable:\r\nthat it is easy to tell vice from virtue, by the unique pleasure and\r\nthe peculiar repugnance that seem to be their natural effects, it\r\nfollows that animals, composed of the same matter, lacking perhaps\r\nonly one degree of fermentation to make it exactly like man's,\r\nmust share the same prerogatives of animal nature, and that thus\r\nthere exists no soul or sensitive substance without remorse.{37}\r\nThe following consideration will reinforce these observations.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to destroy the natural law. The impress of it on\r\nall animals is so strong, that I have no doubt that the wildest and\r\nmost savage have some moments of repentance. I believe that that\r\ncruel maid of Chalons in Champagne must have sorrowed for her crime,\r\nif she really ate her sister. I think that the same thing is true\r\nof all those who commit crimes, even involuntary or temperamental\r\ncrimes: true of Gaston of Orleans who could not help stealing; of a\r\ncertain woman who was subject to the same crime when pregnant, and\r\nwhose children inherited it; of the woman who, in the same condition,\r\nate her husband; of that other woman who killed her children, salted\r\ntheir bodies, and ate a piece of them every day, as a little relish;\r\nof that daughter of a thief and cannibal who at twelve years followed\r\nin his steps, although she had been orphaned when she was a year old,\r\nand had been brought up by honest people; to say nothing of many other\r\nexamples of which the records of our observers are full, all of them\r\nproving that there are a thousand hereditary vices and virtues which\r\nare transmitted from parents to children as those of the foster mother\r\npass to the children she nurses. Now, I believe and admit that these\r\nwretches do not for the most part feel at the time the enormity of\r\ntheir actions. Bulimia, or canine hunger, for example, can stifle\r\nall feeling; it is a mania of the stomach that one is compelled to\r\nsatisfy, but what remorse must be in store for those women, when they\r\ncome to themselves and grow sober, and remember the crimes they have\r\ncommitted against those they held most dear! What a punishment for\r\nan involuntary crime which they could not resist, of which they had\r\nno consciousness whatever! However, this is apparently not enough\r\nfor the judges. For of these women, of whom I tell, one was cruelly\r\nbeaten and burned, and another was buried alive. I realize all that\r\nis demanded by the interest of society. But doubtless it is much to\r\nbe wished that excellent physicians might be the only judges. They\r\nalone could tell the innocent criminal from the guilty. If reason is\r\nthe slave of a depraved or mad desire, how can it control the desire?\r\n\r\nBut if crime carries with it its own more or less cruel punishment,\r\nif the most continued and most barbarous habit can not entirely blot\r\nout repentance in the crudest hearts, if criminals are lacerated by the\r\nvery memory of their deeds, why should we frighten the imagination of\r\nweak minds, by a hell, by specters, and by precipices of fire even less\r\nreal than those of Pascal? [15] Why must we have recourse to fables, as\r\nan honest pope once said himself, to torment even the unhappy wretches\r\nwho are executed, because we do not think that they are sufficiently\r\npunished by their own conscience, their first executioner? I do\r\nnot mean to say that all criminals are unjustly punished; I only\r\nmaintain that those whose will is depraved, and whose conscience is\r\nextinguished, are punished enough by their remorse when they come to\r\nthemselves, a remorse, I venture to assert, from which nature should in\r\nthis case have delivered unhappy souls dragged on by a fatal necessity.\r\n\r\nCriminals, scoundrels, ingrates, those in short without natural\r\nfeelings, unhappy tyrants who are unworthy of life, in vain take\r\na cruel pleasure in their barbarity, for there are calm moments of\r\nreflection in which the avenging conscience arises, testifies against\r\nthem, and condemns them to be almost ceaselessly torn to pieces at\r\ntheir own hands. Whoever torments men is tormented by himself; and\r\nthe sufferings that he will experience will be the just measure of\r\nthose that he has inflicted.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is so much pleasure in doing good, in\r\nrecognizing and appreciating what one receives, so much satisfaction\r\nin practising virtue, in being gentle, humane, kind, charitable,\r\ncompassionate and generous (for this one word includes all the\r\nvirtues), that I consider as sufficiently punished any one who is\r\nunfortunate enough not to have been born virtuous.\r\n\r\nWe were not originally made to be learned; we have become so perhaps\r\nby a sort of abuse of our organic faculties, and at the expense of\r\nthe State which nourishes a host of sluggards whom vanity has adorned\r\nwith the name of philosophers. Nature has created us all solely to be\r\nhappy{38}--yes, all of us from the crawling worm to the eagle lost\r\nin the clouds. For this cause she has given all animals some share\r\nof natural law, a share greater or less according to the needs of\r\neach animal's organs when in normal condition.\r\n\r\nNow how shall we define natural law? It is a feeling that teaches us\r\nwhat we should not do, because we would not wish it to be done to\r\nus. Should I dare add to this common idea, that this feeling seems\r\nto me but a kind of fear or dread, as salutary to the race as to the\r\nindividual; for may it not be true that we respect the purse and life\r\nof others only to save our own possessions, our honor, and ourselves;\r\nlike those Ixions of Christianity{39} who love God and embrace so\r\nmany fantastic virtues, merely because they are afraid of hell!\r\n\r\nYou see that natural law is but an intimate feeling that,\r\nlike all other feelings (thought included), belongs also to\r\nimagination. Evidently, therefore, natural law does not presuppose\r\neducation, revelation, nor legislator,--provided one does not propose\r\nto confuse natural law with civil laws, in the ridiculous fashion of\r\nthe theologians.\r\n\r\nThe arms of fanaticism may destroy those who support these truths,\r\nbut they will never destroy the truths themselves.\r\n\r\nI do not mean to call in question the existence of a supreme being;\r\non the contrary it seems to me that the greatest degree of probability\r\nis in favor of this belief. But since the existence of this being goes\r\nno further than that of any other toward proving the need of worship,\r\nit is a theoretic truth with very little practical value. Therefore,\r\nsince we may say, after such long experience, that religion does not\r\nimply exact honesty, we are authorized by the same reasons to think\r\nthat atheism does not exclude it.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, who can be sure that the reason for man's existence\r\nis not simply the fact that he exists?{40} Perhaps he was thrown by\r\nchance on some spot on the earth's surface, nobody knows how nor why,\r\nbut simply that he must live and die, like the mushrooms which appear\r\nfrom day to day, or like those flowers which border the ditches and\r\ncover the walls.\r\n\r\nLet us not lose ourselves in the infinite, for we are not made to have\r\nthe least idea thereof, and are absolutely unable to get back to the\r\norigin of things. Besides it does not matter for our peace of mind,\r\nwhether matter be eternal or have been created, whether there be or\r\nbe not a God. How foolish to torment ourselves so much about things\r\nwhich we can not know, and which would not make us any happier even\r\nwere we to gain knowledge about them!\r\n\r\nBut, some will say, read all such works as those of Fénelon,{41} of\r\nNieuwentyt,{42} of Abadie,{43} of Derham,{44} of Rais,{45} and the\r\nrest. Well! what will they teach me or rather what have they taught\r\nme? They are only tiresome repetitions of zealous writers, one of\r\nwhom adds to the other only verbiage, more likely to strengthen than\r\nto undermine the foundations of atheism. The number of the evidences\r\ndrawn from the spectacle of nature does not give these evidences any\r\nmore force. Either the mere structure of a finger, of an ear, of an\r\neye, a single observation of Malpighi{46} proves all, and doubtless\r\nmuch better than Descartes and Malebranche proved it, or all the\r\nother evidences prove nothing. Deists,{47} and even Christians, should\r\ntherefore be content to point out that throughout the animal kingdom\r\nthe same aims are pursued and accomplished by an infinite number of\r\ndifferent mechanisms, all of them however exactly geometrical. For what\r\nstronger weapons could there be with which to overthrow atheists? It\r\nis true that if my reason does not deceive me, man and the whole\r\nuniverse seem to have been designed for this unity of aim. The sun,\r\nair, water, the organism, the shape of bodies,--everything is brought\r\nto a focus in the eye as in a mirror that faithfully presents to the\r\nimagination all the objects reflected in it, in accordance with the\r\nlaws required by the infinite variety of bodies which take part in\r\nvision. In ears we find everywhere a striking variety, and yet the\r\ndifference of structure in men, animals, birds, and fishes, does not\r\nproduce different uses. All ears are so mathematically made, that\r\nthey tend equally to one and the same end, namely, hearing. But would\r\nChance, the deist asks, be a great enough geometrician to vary thus,\r\nat pleasure, the works of which she is supposed to be the author,\r\nwithout being hindered by so great a diversity from gaining the\r\nsame end? Again, the deist will bring forward as a difficulty those\r\nparts of the animal that are clearly contained in it for future use,\r\nthe butterfly in the caterpillar, man in the sperm, a whole polyp in\r\neach of its parts, the valvule in the oval orifice, the lungs in the\r\nfoetus, the teeth in their sockets, the bones in the fluid from which\r\nthey detach themselves and (in an incomprehensible manner) harden. And\r\nsince the partisans of this theory, far from neglecting anything that\r\nwould strengthen it, never tire of piling up proof upon proof, they\r\nare willing to avail themselves of everything, even of the weakness\r\nof the mind in certain cases. Look, they say, at men like Spinoza,\r\nVanini,{48} Desbarreau,{49} and Boindin,{50} apostles who honor deism\r\nmore than they harm it. The duration of their health was the measure\r\nof their unbelief, and one rarely fails, they add, to renounce atheism\r\nwhen the passions, with their instrument, the body, have grown weak.\r\n\r\nThat is certainly the most that can be said in favor of the\r\nexistence of God: although the last argument is frivolous in that\r\nthese conversions are short, and the mind almost always regains its\r\nformer opinions and acts accordingly, as soon as it has regained or\r\nrather rediscovered its strength in that of the body. That is, at\r\nleast, much more than was said by the physician Diderot,{51} in his\r\n\"Pensées Philosophiques,\" a sublime work that will not convince a\r\nsingle atheist. What reply can, in truth, be made to a man who says,\r\n\"We do not know nature; causes hidden in her breast might have produced\r\neverything. In your turn, observe the polyp of Trembley:{52} does it\r\nnot contain in itself the causes which bring about regeneration? Why\r\nthen would it be absurd to think that there are physical causes by\r\nreason of which everything has been made, and to which the whole chain\r\nof this vast universe is so necessarily bound and held that nothing\r\nwhich happens, could have failed to happen,{53}--causes, of which we\r\nare so invincibly ignorant that we have had recourse to a God, who, as\r\nsome aver, is not so much as a logical entity? Thus to destroy chance\r\nis not to prove the existence of a supreme being, since there may be\r\nsome other thing which is neither chance nor God--I mean, nature. It\r\nfollows that the study of nature can make only unbelievers; and the\r\nway of thinking of all its more successful investigators proves this.\"\r\n\r\nThe weight of the universe therefore far from crushing a real atheist\r\ndoes not even shake him. All these evidences of a creator, repeated\r\nthousands and thousands of times, evidences that are placed far above\r\nthe comprehension of men like us, are self-evident (however far one\r\npush the argument) only to the anti-Pyrrhonians,{54} or to those who\r\nhave enough confidence in their reason to believe themselves capable of\r\njudging on the basis of certain phenomena, against which, as you see,\r\nthe atheists can urge others perhaps equally strong and absolutely\r\nopposed. For if we listen to the naturalists again, they will tell\r\nus that the very causes which, in a chemist's hands, by a chance\r\ncombination, made the first mirror, in the hands of nature made the\r\npure water, the mirror of the simple shepherdess; that the motion which\r\nkeeps the world going could have created it, that each body has taken\r\nthe place assigned to it by its own nature, that the air must have\r\nsurrounded the earth, and that iron and the other metals are produced\r\nby internal motions of the earth, for one and the same reason; that\r\nthe sun is as much a natural product as electricity, that it was not\r\nmade to warm the earth and its inhabitants, whom it sometimes burns,\r\nany more than the rain was made to make the seeds grow, which it often\r\nspoils; that the mirror and the water were no more made for people to\r\nsee themselves in, than were all other polished bodies with this same\r\nproperty; that the eye is in truth a kind of glass in which the soul\r\ncan contemplate the image of objects as they are presented to it by\r\nthese bodies, but that it is not proved that this organ was really made\r\nexpressly for this contemplation, nor purposely placed in its socket,\r\nand in short that it may well be that Lucretius,{55} the physician\r\nLamy,{56} and all Epicureans both ancient and modern were right when\r\nthey suggested that the eye sees only because it is formed and placed\r\nas it is,{57} and that, given once for all, the same rules of motion\r\nfollowed by nature in the generation and development of bodies,\r\nthis marvelous organ could not have been formed and placed differently.\r\n\r\nSuch is the pro and the con, and the summary of those fine arguments\r\nthat will eternally divide the philosophers. I do not take either side.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Non nostrum inter vos tantas componere lites.\"{58}\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is what I said to one of my friends, a Frenchman, as frank a\r\nPyrronian as I, a man of much merit, and worthy of a better fate. He\r\ngave me a very singular answer in regard to the matter. \"It is true,\"\r\nhe told me, \"that the pro and con should not disturb at all the soul of\r\na philosopher, who sees that nothing is proved with clearness enough\r\nto force his consent, and that the arguments offered on one side\r\nare neutralized by those of the other. However,\" he continued, \"the\r\nuniverse will never be happy, unless it is atheistic.\"{59} Here are\r\nthis wretch's reasons. If atheism, said he, were generally accepted,\r\nall the forms of religion would then be destroyed and cut off at the\r\nroots. No more theological wars, no more soldiers of religion--such\r\nterrible soldiers! Nature infected with a sacred poison, would regain\r\nits rights and its purity. Deaf to all other voices, tranquil mortals\r\nwould follow only the spontaneous dictates of their own being the\r\nonly commands which can never be despised with impunity and which\r\nalone can lead us to happiness through the pleasant paths of virtue.\r\n\r\nSuch is natural law: whoever rigidly observes it is a good man and\r\ndeserves the confidence of all the human race. Whoever fails to follow\r\nit scrupulously affects, in vain, the specious exterior of another\r\nreligion; he is a scamp or a hypocrite whom I distrust.\r\n\r\nAfter this, let a vain people think otherwise, let them dare affirm\r\nthat even probity is at stake in not believing in revelation,\r\nin a word that another religion than that of nature is necessary,\r\nwhatever it may be. Such an assertion is wretched and pitiable;\r\nand so is the good opinion which each one gives us of the religion\r\nhe has embraced! We do not seek here the votes of the crowd. Whoever\r\nraises in his heart altars to superstition, is born to worship idols\r\nand not to thrill to virtue.\r\n\r\nBut since all the faculties of the soul depend to such a degree\r\non the proper organization of the brain and of the whole body,\r\nthat apparently they are but this organization itself, the soul is\r\nclearly an enlightened machine. For finally, even if man alone had\r\nreceived a share of natural law, would he be any less a machine for\r\nthat? A few more wheels, a few more springs than in the most perfect\r\nanimals, the brain proportionally nearer the heart and for this very\r\nreason receiving more blood--any one of a number of unknown causes\r\nmight always produce this delicate conscience so easily wounded, this\r\nremorse which is no more foreign to matter than to thought, and in a\r\nword all the differences that are supposed to exist here. Could the\r\norganism then suffice for everything? Once more, yes; since thought\r\nvisibly develops with our organs, why should not the matter of which\r\nthey are composed be susceptible of remorse also, when once it has\r\nacquired, with time, the faculty of feeling?\r\n\r\nThe soul is therefore but an empty word, of which no one has any\r\nidea, and which an enlightened man should use only to signify the\r\npart in us that thinks.{60} Given the least principle of motion,\r\nanimated bodies will have all that is necessary for moving, feeling,\r\nthinking, repenting, or in a word for conducting themselves in the\r\nphysical realm, and in the moral realm which depends upon it.\r\n\r\nYet we take nothing for granted; those who perhaps think that all the\r\ndifficulties have not yet been removed shall now read of experiments\r\nthat will completely satisfy them.\r\n\r\n1. The flesh of all animals palpitates after death. This palpitation\r\ncontinues longer, the more cold blooded the animal is and the less\r\nit perspires. Tortoises, lizards, serpents, etc. are evidence of this.\r\n\r\n2. Muscles separated from the body contract when they are stimulated.\r\n\r\n3. The intestines keep up their peristaltic or vermicular motion for\r\na long time.\r\n\r\n4. According to Cowper,{61} a simple injection of hot water reanimates\r\nthe heart and the muscles.\r\n\r\n5. A frog's heart moves for an hour or more after it has been removed\r\nfrom the body, especially when exposed to the sun or better still when\r\nplaced on a hot table or chair. If this movement seems totally lost,\r\none has only to stimulate the heart, and that hollow muscle beats\r\nagain. Harvey{62} made this same observation on toads.\r\n\r\n6. Bacon of Verulam{63} in his treatise \"Sylva Sylvarum\" cites the\r\ncase of a man convicted of treason, who was opened alive, and whose\r\nheart thrown into hot water leaped several times, each time less high,\r\nto the perpendicular height of two feet.\r\n\r\n7. Take a tiny chicken still in the egg, cut out the heart and you\r\nwill observe the same phenomena as before, under almost the same\r\nconditions. The warmth of the breath alone reanimates an animal about\r\nto perish in the air pump.\r\n\r\nThe same experiments, which we owe to Boyle{64} and to Sténon,{65}\r\nare made on pigeons, dogs, and rabbits. Pieces of their hearts beat\r\nas their whole hearts would. The same movements can be seen in paws\r\nthat have been cut off from moles.\r\n\r\n8. The caterpillar, the worm, the spider, the fly, the eel--all exhibit\r\nthe same phenomena; and in hot water, because of the fire it contains,\r\nthe movement of the detached parts increases.\r\n\r\n9. A drunken soldier cut off with one stroke of his sabre an Indian\r\nrooster's head. The animal remained standing, then walked, and ran:\r\nhappening to run against a wall, it turned around, beat its wings\r\nstill running, and finally fell down. As it lay on the ground, all the\r\nmuscles of this rooster kept on moving. That is what I saw myself,\r\nand almost the same phenomena can easily be observed in kittens or\r\npuppies with their heads cut off.\r\n\r\n10. Polyps do more than move after they have been cut in pieces. In a\r\nweek they regenerate to form as many animals as there are pieces. I\r\nam sorry that these facts speak against the naturalists' system of\r\ngeneration; or rather I am very glad of it, for let this discovery\r\nteach us never to reach a general conclusion even on the ground of\r\nall known (and most decisive) experiments.\r\n\r\nHere we have many more facts than are needed to prove, in an\r\nincontestable way, that each tiny fibre or part of an organized\r\nbody moves by a principle which belongs to it. Its activity, unlike\r\nvoluntary motions, does not depend in any way on the nerves, since\r\nthe movements in question occur in parts of the body which have no\r\nconnection with the circulation. But if this force is manifested even\r\nin sections of fibres the heart, which is a composite of peculiarly\r\nconnected fibres, must possess the same property. I did not need\r\nBacon's story to persuade me of this. It was easy for me to come to\r\nthis conclusion, both from the perfect analogy of the structure of the\r\nhuman heart with that of animals, and also from the very bulk of the\r\nhuman heart, in which this movement escapes our eyes only because it is\r\nsmothered, and finally because in corpses all the organs are cold and\r\nlifeless. If executed criminals were dissected while their bodies are\r\nstill warm, we should probably see in their hearts the same movements\r\nthat are observed in the face-muscles of those that have been beheaded.\r\n\r\nThe motive principle of the whole body, and even of its parts cut in\r\npieces, is such that it produces not irregular movements, as some have\r\nthought, but very regular ones, in warm blooded and perfect animals\r\nas well as in cold and imperfect ones. No resource therefore remains\r\nopen to our adversaries but to deny thousands and thousands of facts\r\nwhich every man can easily verify.\r\n\r\nIf now any one ask me where is this innate force in our bodies,\r\nI answer that it very clearly resides in what the ancients called\r\nthe parenchyma, that is to say, in the very substance of the organs\r\nnot including the veins, the arteries, the nerves, in a word, that it\r\nresides in the organization of the whole body, and that consequently\r\neach organ contains within itself forces more or less active according\r\nto the need of them.\r\n\r\nLet us now go into some detail concerning these springs of the human\r\nmachine. All the vital, animal, natural, and automatic motions are\r\ncarried on by their action. Is it not in a purely mechanical way\r\nthat the body shrinks back when it is struck with terror at the\r\nsight of an unforeseen precipice, that the eyelids are lowered at\r\nthe menace of a blow, as some have remarked, and that the pupil\r\ncontracts in broad daylight to save the retina, and dilates to see\r\nobjects in darkness? Is it not by mechanical means that the pores\r\nof the skin close in winter so that the cold can not penetrate to\r\nthe interior of the blood vessels, and that the stomach vomits when\r\nit is irritated by poison, by a certain quantity of opium and by all\r\nemetics, etc.? that the heart, the arteries and the muscles contract\r\nin sleep as well as in waking hours, that the lungs serve as bellows\r\ncontinually in exercise, ... that the heart contracts more strongly\r\nthan any other muscle?{66}...\r\n\r\nI shall not go into any more detail concerning all these little\r\nsubordinate forces, well known to all. But there is another more\r\nsubtle and marvelous force, which animates them all; it is the source\r\nof all our feelings, of all our pleasures, of all our passions, and\r\nof all our thoughts: for the brain has its muscles for thinking,\r\nas the legs have muscles for walking.{67} I wish to speak of this\r\nimpetuous principle that Hippocrates calls enormôn (soul). This\r\nprinciple exists and has its seat in the brain at the origin of the\r\nnerves, by which it exercises its control over all the rest of the\r\nbody. By this fact is explained all that can be explained, even to\r\nthe surprising effects of maladies of the imagination....\r\n\r\nLook at the portrait of the famous Pope who is, to say the least,\r\nthe Voltaire of the English. The effort, the energy of his genius are\r\nimprinted upon his countenance. It is convulsed. His eyes protrude\r\nfrom their sockets, the eyebrows are raised with the muscles of the\r\nforehead. Why? Because the brain is in travail and all the body must\r\nshare in such a laborious deliverance. If there were not an internal\r\ncord which pulled the external ones, whence would come all these\r\nphenomena? To admit a soul as explanation of them, is to be reduced to\r\n[explaining phenomena by] the operations of the Holy Spirit.\r\n\r\nIn fact, if what thinks in my brain is not a part of this organ and\r\ntherefore of the whole body, why does my blood boil, and the fever of\r\nmy mind pass into my veins, when lying quietly in bed, I am forming\r\nthe plan of some work or carrying on an abstract calculation? Put\r\nthis question to men of imagination, to great poets, to men who are\r\nenraptured by the felicitous expression of sentiment, and transported\r\nby an exquisite fancy or by the charms of nature, of truth, or of\r\nvirtue! By their enthusiasm, by what they will tell you they have\r\nexperienced, you will judge the cause by its effects; by that harmony\r\nwhich Borelli,{68} a mere anatomist, understood better than all the\r\nLeibnizians, you will comprehend the material unity of man. In short,\r\nif the nerve-tension which causes pain occasions also the fever by\r\nwhich the distracted mind loses its will-power, and if, conversely,\r\nthe mind too much excited, disturbs the body (and kindles that inner\r\nfire which killed Bayle while he was still so young); if an agitation\r\nrouses my desire and my ardent wish for what, a moment ago, I cared\r\nnothing about, and if in their turn certain brain impressions excite\r\nthe same longing and the same desires, then why should we regard as\r\ndouble what is manifestly one being? In vain you fall back on the\r\npower of the will, since for one order that the will gives, it bows a\r\nhundred times to the yoke.{69} And what wonder that in health the body\r\nobeys, since a torrent of blood and of animal spirits{70} forces its\r\nobedience, and since the will has as ministers an invisible legion of\r\nfluids swifter than lightning and ever ready to do its bidding! But\r\nas the power of the will is exercised by means of the nerves, it is\r\nlikewise limited by them.....\r\n\r\nDoes the result of jaundice surprise you? Do you not know that the\r\ncolor of bodies depends on the color of the glasses through which\r\nwe look at them,{71} and that whatever is the color of the humors,\r\nsuch is the color of objects, at least for us, vain playthings of a\r\nthousand illusions? But remove this color from the aqueous humor of\r\nthe eye, let the bile flow through its natural filter, then the soul\r\nhaving new eyes, will no longer see yellow. Again, is it not thus, by\r\nremoving cataract, or by injecting the Eustachian canal, that sight\r\nis restored to the blind, or hearing to the deaf? How many people,\r\nwho were perhaps only clever charlatans, passed for miracle workers\r\nin the dark ages! Beautiful the soul, and powerful the will which\r\ncan not act save by permission of the bodily conditions, and whose\r\ntastes change with age and fever! Should we, then, be astonished\r\nthat philosophers have always had in mind the health of the body,\r\nto preserve the health of the soul, that Pythagoras{72} gave rules\r\nfor the diet as carefully as Plato forbade wine?{73} The regime\r\nsuited to the body is always the one with which sane physicians\r\nthink they must begin, when it is a question of forming the mind,\r\nand of instructing it in the knowledge of truth and virtue; but\r\nthese are vain words in the disorder of illness, and in the tumult\r\nof the senses. Without the precepts of hygiene, Epictetus, Socrates,\r\nPlato, and the rest preach in vain: all ethics is fruitless for one\r\nwho lacks his share of temperance; it is the source of all virtues,\r\nas intemperance is the source of all vices.\r\n\r\nIs more needed, (for why lose myself in discussion of the passions\r\nwhich are all explained by the term, enormôn, of Hippocrates) to prove\r\nthat man is but an animal, or a collection of springs which wind each\r\nother up, without our being able to tell at what point in this human\r\ncircle, nature has begun? If these springs differ among themselves,\r\nthese differences consist only in their position and in their degrees\r\nof strength, and never in their nature; wherefore the soul is but\r\na principle of motion or a material and sensible part of the brain,\r\nwhich can be regarded, without fear of error, as the mainspring of\r\nthe whole machine, having a visible influence on all the parts. The\r\nsoul seems even to have been made for the brain, so that all the other\r\nparts of the system are but a kind of emanation from the brain. This\r\nwill appear from certain observations, made on different embryos,\r\nwhich I shall now enumerate.\r\n\r\nThis oscillation, which is natural or suited to our machine, and with\r\nwhich each fibre and even each fibrous element, so to speak, seems\r\nto be endowed, like that of a pendulum, can not keep up forever. It\r\nmust be renewed, as it loses strength, invigorated when it is tired,\r\nand weakened when it is disturbed by excess of strength and vigor. In\r\nthis alone, true medicine consists.\r\n\r\nThe body is but a watch, whose watchmaker is the new chyle. Nature's\r\nfirst care, when the chyle enters the blood, is to excite in it a\r\nkind of fever{74} which the chemists, who dream only of retorts, must\r\nhave taken for fermentation. This fever produces a greater filtration\r\nof spirits, which mechanically animate the muscles and the heart,\r\nas if they had been sent there by order of the will.\r\n\r\nThese then are the causes or the forces of life which thus sustain for\r\na hundred years that perpetual movement of the solids and the liquids\r\nwhich is as necessary to the first as to the second. But who can say\r\nwhether the solids contribute more than the fluids to this movement or\r\nvice versa? All that we know is that the action of the former would\r\nsoon cease without the help of the latter, that is, without the help\r\nof the fluids which by their onset rouse and maintain the elasticity\r\nof the blood vessels on which their own circulation depends. From this\r\nit follows that after death the natural resilience of each substance\r\nis still more or less strong according to the remnants of life which\r\nit outlives, being the last to perish. So true is it that this force\r\nof the animal parts can be preserved and strengthened by that of\r\nthe circulation, but that it does not depend on the strength of the\r\ncirculation, since, as we have seen, it can dispense with even the\r\nintegrity of each member or organ.\r\n\r\nI am aware that this opinion has not been relished by all scholars,\r\nand that Stahl especially had much scorn for it. This great chemist\r\nhas wished to persuade us that the soul is the sole cause of all our\r\nmovements. But this is to speak as a fanatic and not as a philosopher.\r\n\r\nTo destroy the hypothesis of Stahl,{75} we need not make as great an\r\neffort as I find that others have done before me. We need only glance\r\nat a violinist. What flexibility, what lightness in his fingers! The\r\nmovements are so quick, that it seems almost as if there were no\r\nsuccession. But I pray, or rather I challenge, the followers of\r\nStahl who understand so perfectly all that our soul can do, to\r\ntell me how it could possibly execute so many motions so quickly,\r\nmotions, moreover, which take place so far from the soul, and in so\r\nmany different places. That is to suppose that a flute player could\r\nplay brilliant cadences on an infinite number of holes that he could\r\nnot know, and on which he could not even put his finger!\r\n\r\nBut let us say with M. Hecquet{76} that all men may not go to\r\nCorinth.{77} Why should not Stahl have been even more favored by nature\r\nas a man than as a chemist and a practitioner? Happy mortal, he must\r\nhave received a soul different from that of the rest of mankind,--a\r\nsovereign soul, which, not content with having some control over\r\nthe voluntary muscles, easily held the reins of all the movements\r\nof the body, and could suspend them, calm them, or excite them,\r\nat its pleasure! With so despotic a mistress, in whose hands were,\r\nin a sense, the beating of the heart, and the laws of circulation,\r\nthere could certainly be no fever, no pain, no weariness,...! The\r\nsoul wills, and the springs play, contract or relax. But how did the\r\nsprings of Stahl's machine get out of order so soon? He who has in\r\nhimself so great a doctor, should be immortal.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Stahl is not the only one who has rejected the principle\r\nof the vibration of organic bodies. Greater minds have not used\r\nthe principle when they wished to explain the action of the heart,\r\n... etc. One need only read the \"Institutions of Medicine\" by\r\nBoerhaave{78} to see what laborious and enticing systems this great\r\nman was obliged to invent, by the labor of his mighty genius, through\r\nfailure to admit that there is so wonderful a force in all bodies.\r\n\r\nWillis{79} and Perrault,{80} minds of a more feeble stamp, but careful\r\nobservers of nature (whereas nature was known to the famous Leyden\r\nprofessor only through others and second hand, so to speak) seem to\r\nhave preferred to suppose a soul generally extended over the whole\r\nbody, instead of the principle which we are describing. But according\r\nto this hypothesis (which was the hypothesis of Vergil and of all\r\nEpicureans, an hypothesis which the history of the polyp might seem\r\nat first sight to favor) the movements which go on after the death of\r\nthe subject in which they inhere are due to a remnant of soul still\r\nmaintained by the parts that contract, though, from the moment of\r\ndeath, these are not excited by the blood and the spirits. Whence it\r\nmay be seen that these writers, whose solid works easily eclipse all\r\nphilosophic fables, are deceived only in the manner of those who have\r\nendowed matter with the faculty of thinking, I mean to say, by having\r\nexpressed themselves badly in obscure and meaningless terms. In\r\ntruth, what is this remnant of a soul, if it is not the \"moving\r\nforce\" of the Leibnizians (badly rendered by such an expression),\r\nwhich however Perrault in particular has really foreseen. See his\r\n\"Treatise on the Mechanism of Animals.\"\r\n\r\nNow that it is clearly proved against the Cartesians, the followers of\r\nStahl, the Malebranchists, and the theologians who little deserve to be\r\nmentioned here, that matter is self-moved,{81} not only when organized,\r\nas in a whole heart, for example, but even when this organization has\r\nbeen destroyed, human curiosity would like to discover how a body,\r\nby the fact that it is originally endowed with the breath of life,\r\nfinds itself adorned in consequence with the faculty of feeling,\r\nand thus with that of thought. And, heavens, what efforts have not\r\nbeen made by certain philosophers to manage to prove this! and what\r\nnonsense on this subject I have had the patience to read!\r\n\r\nAll that experience teaches us is that while movement persists, however\r\nslight it may be, in one or more fibres, we need only stimulate them\r\nto re-excite and animate this movement almost extinguished. This has\r\nbeen shown in the host of experiments with which I have undertaken\r\nto crush the systems. It is therefore certain that motion and feeling\r\nexcite each other in turn, both in a whole body and in the same body\r\nwhen its structure is destroyed, to say nothing of certain plants which\r\nseem to exhibit the same phenomena of the union of feeling and motion.\r\n\r\nBut furthermore, how many excellent philosophers have shown that\r\nthought is but a faculty of feeling, and that the reasonable soul\r\nis but the feeling soul engaged in contemplating its ideas and in\r\nreasoning! This would be proved by the fact alone that when feeling\r\nis stifled, thought also is checked, for instance in apoplexy, in\r\nlethargy, in catalepsis, etc. For it is ridiculous to suggest that,\r\nduring these stupors, the soul keeps on thinking, even though it does\r\nnot remember the ideas that it has had.\r\n\r\nAs to the development of feeling and motion, it is absurd to waste\r\ntime seeking for its mechanism. The nature of motion is as unknown\r\nto us as that of matter.{82} How can we discover how it is produced\r\nunless, like the author of \"The History of the Soul,\" we resuscitate\r\nthe old and unintelligible doctrine of substantial forms? I am then\r\nquite as content not to know how inert and simple matter becomes\r\nactive and highly organized, as not to be able to look at the sun\r\nwithout red glasses; and I am as little disquieted concerning the\r\nother incomprehensible wonders of nature, the production of feeling\r\nand of thought in a being which earlier appeared to our limited eyes\r\nas a mere clod of clay.\r\n\r\nGrant only that organized matter is endowed with a principle of motion,\r\nwhich alone differentiates it from the inorganic (and can one deny\r\nthis in the face of the most incontestable observation?) and that\r\namong animals, as I have sufficiently proved, everything depends\r\nupon the diversity of this organization: these admissions suffice\r\nfor guessing the riddle of substances and of man. It [thus] appears\r\nthat there is but one [type of organization] in the universe, and\r\nthat man is the most perfect [example]. He is to the ape, and to the\r\nmost intelligent animals, as the planetary pendulum of Huyghens{83}\r\nis to a watch of Julien Leroy.{84} More instruments, more wheels and\r\nmore springs were necessary to mark the movements of the planets than\r\nto mark or strike the hours; and Vaucanson,{85} who needed more skill\r\nfor making his flute player than for making his duck, would have needed\r\nstill more to make a talking man, a mechanism no longer to be regarded\r\nas impossible, especially in the hands of another Prometheus. In like\r\nfashion, it was necessary that nature should use more elaborate art\r\nin making and sustaining a machine which for a whole century could\r\nmark all motions of the heart and of the mind; for though one does\r\nnot tell time by the pulse, it is at least the barometer of the warmth\r\nand the vivacity by which one may estimate the nature of the soul. I\r\nam right! The human body is a watch, a large watch constructed with\r\nsuch skill and ingenuity, that if the wheel which marks the seconds\r\nhappens to stop, the minute wheel turns and keeps on going its round,\r\nand in the same way the quarter-hour wheel, and all the others go\r\non running when the first wheels have stopped because rusty or,\r\nfor any reason, out of order. Is it not for a similar reason that\r\nthe stoppage of a few blood vessels is not enough to destroy or\r\nsuspend the strength of the movement which is in the heart as in the\r\nmainspring of the machine; since, on the contrary, the fluids whose\r\nvolume is diminished, having a shorter road to travel, cover the\r\nground more quickly, borne on as by a fresh current which the energy\r\nof the heart increases in proportion to the resistance it encounters\r\nat the ends of the blood-vessels? And is not this the reason why the\r\nloss of sight (caused by the compression of the optic nerve and by\r\nits ceasing to convey the images of objects) no more hinders hearing,\r\nthan the loss of hearing (caused by obstruction of the functions of the\r\nauditory nerve) implies the loss of sight? In the same way, finally,\r\ndoes not one man hear (except immediately after his attack) without\r\nbeing able to say that he hears, while another who hears nothing, but\r\nwhose lingual nerves are uninjured in the brain, mechanically tells\r\nof all the dreams which pass through his mind? These phenomena do not\r\nsurprise enlightened physicians at all. They know what to think about\r\nman's nature, and (more accurately to express myself in passing) of two\r\nphysicians, the better one and the one who deserves more confidence is\r\nalways, in my opinion, the one who is more versed in the physique or\r\nmechanism of the human body, and who, leaving aside the soul and all\r\nthe anxieties which this chimera gives to fools and to ignorant men,\r\nis seriously occupied only in pure naturalism.\r\n\r\nTherefore let the pretended M. Charp deride philosophers who have\r\nregarded animals as machines. How different is my view! I believe\r\nthat Descartes would be a man in every way worthy of respect, if,\r\nborn in a century that he had not been obliged to enlighten, he had\r\nknown the value of experiment and observation, and the danger of\r\ncutting loose from them. But it is none the less just for me to make\r\nan authentic reparation to this great man for all the insignificant\r\nphilosophers--poor jesters, and poor imitators of Locke--who instead\r\nof laughing impudently at Descartes, might better realize that without\r\nhim the field of philosophy, like the field of science without Newton,\r\nmight perhaps be still uncultivated.\r\n\r\nThis celebrated philosopher, it is true, was much deceived, and no\r\none denies that. But at any rate he understood animal nature, he was\r\nthe first to prove completely that animals are pure machines.{86}\r\nAnd after a discovery of this importance demanding so much sagacity,\r\nhow can we without ingratitude fail to pardon all his errors!\r\n\r\nIn my eyes, they are all atoned for by that great confession. For after\r\nall, although he extols the distinctness of the two substances, this\r\nis plainly but a trick of skill, a ruse of style, to make theologians\r\nswallow a poison, hidden in the shade of an analogy which strikes\r\neverybody else and which they alone fail to notice. For it is this,\r\nthis strong analogy, which forces all scholars and wise judges to\r\nconfess that these proud and vain beings, more distinguished by their\r\npride than by the name of men however much they may wish to exalt\r\nthemselves, are at bottom only animals and machines which, though\r\nupright, go on all fours. They all have this marvelous instinct, which\r\nis developed by education into mind, and which always has its seat\r\nin the brain, (or for want of that when it is lacking or hardened, in\r\nthe medulla oblongata) and never in the cerebellum; for I have often\r\nseen the cerebellum injured, and other observers [16] have found it\r\nhardened, when the soul has not ceased to fulfil its functions.\r\n\r\nTo be a machine, to feel, to think, to know how to distinguish good\r\nfrom bad, as well as blue from yellow, in a word, to be born with\r\nan intelligence and a sure moral instinct, and to be but an animal,\r\nare therefore characters which are no more contradictory, than to\r\nbe an ape or a parrot and to be able to give oneself pleasure.... I\r\nbelieve that thought is so little incompatible with organized matter,\r\nthat it seems to be one of its properties on a par with electricity,\r\nthe faculty of motion, impenetrability, extension, etc.\r\n\r\nDo you ask for further observations? Here are some which are\r\nincontestable and which all prove that man resembles animals perfectly,\r\nin his origin as well as in all the points in which we have thought\r\nit essential to make the comparison....\r\n\r\nLet us observe man both in and out of his shell, let us examine young\r\nembryos of four, six, eight or fifteen days with a microscope; after\r\nthat time our eyes are sufficient. What do we see? The head alone;\r\na little round egg with two black points which mark the eyes. Before\r\nthat, everything is formless, and one sees only a medullary pulp,\r\nwhich is the brain, in which are formed first the roots of the nerves,\r\nthat is, the principle of feeling, and the heart, which already\r\nwithin this substance has the power of beating of itself; it is the\r\npunctum saliens of Malpighi, which perhaps already owes a part of its\r\nexcitability to the influence of the nerves. Then little by little, one\r\nsees the head lengthen from the neck, which, in dilating, forms first\r\nthe thorax inside which the heart has already sunk, there to become\r\nstationary; below that is the abdomen which is divided by a partition\r\n(the diaphragm). One of these enlargements of the body forms the arms,\r\nthe hands, the fingers, the nails, and the hair; the other forms the\r\nthighs, the legs, the feet, etc., which differ only in their observed\r\nsituation, and which constitute the support and the balancing pole of\r\nthe body. The whole process is a strange sort of growth, like that\r\nof plants. On the tops of our heads is hair in place of which the\r\nplants have leaves and flowers; everywhere is shown the same luxury\r\nof nature, and finally the directing principle of plants is placed\r\nwhere we have our soul, that other quintessence of man.\r\n\r\nSuch is the uniformity of nature, which we are beginning to realize;\r\nand the analogy of the animal with the vegetable kingdom, of man with\r\nplant. Perhaps there even are animal plants, which in vegetating,\r\neither fight as polyps do, or perform other functions characteristic\r\nof animals....\r\n\r\nWe are veritable moles in the field of nature; we achieve little more\r\nthan the mole's journey and it is our pride which prescribes limits\r\nto the limitless. We are in the position of a watch that should say\r\n(a writer of fables would make the watch a hero in a silly tale):\r\n\"I was never made by that fool of a workman, I who divide time, who\r\nmark so exactly the course of the sun, who repeat aloud the hours\r\nwhich I mark! No! that is impossible!\" In the same way, we disdain,\r\nungrateful wretches that we are, this common mother of all kingdoms,\r\nas the chemists say. We imagine, or rather we infer, a cause superior\r\nto that to which we owe all, and which truly has wrought all things\r\nin an inconceivable fashion. No; matter contains nothing base, except\r\nto the vulgar eyes which do not recognize her in her most splendid\r\nworks; and nature is no stupid workman. She creates millions of men,\r\nwith a facility and a pleasure more intense than the effort of a\r\nwatchmaker in making the most complicated watch. Her power shines\r\nforth equally in creating the lowliest insect and in creating the\r\nmost highly developed man; the animal kingdom costs her no more than\r\nthe vegetable, and the most splendid genius no more than a blade\r\nof wheat. Let us then judge by what we see of that which is hidden\r\nfrom the curiosity of our eyes and of our investigations, and let\r\nus not imagine anything beyond. Let us observe the ape, the beaver,\r\nthe elephant, etc., in their operations. If it is clear that these\r\nactivities can not be performed without intelligence, why refuse\r\nintelligence to these animals? And if you grant them a soul, you are\r\nlost, you fanatics! You will in vain say that you assert nothing about\r\nthe nature of the animal soul and that you deny its immortality. Who\r\ndoes not see that this is a gratuitous assertion; who does not see that\r\nthe soul of an animal must be either mortal or immortal, whichever\r\nours [is], and that it must therefore undergo the same fate as ours,\r\nwhatever that may be, and that thus [in admitting that animals have\r\nsouls], you fall into Scylla in the effort to avoid Charybdis?\r\n\r\nBreak the chain of your prejudices, arm yourselves with the torch\r\nof experience, and you will render to nature the honor she deserves,\r\ninstead of inferring anything to her disadvantage, from the ignorance\r\nin which she has left you. Only open wide your eyes, only disregard\r\nwhat you can not understand, and you will see that the ploughman whose\r\nintelligence and ideas extend no further than the bounds of his furrow,\r\ndoes not differ essentially from the greatest genius,--a truth which\r\nthe dissection of Descartes's and of Newton's brains would have proved;\r\nyou will be persuaded that the imbecile and the fool are animals with\r\nhuman faces, as the intelligent ape is a little man in another shape;\r\nin short, you will learn that since everything depends absolutely on\r\ndifference of organization, a well constructed animal which has studied\r\nastronomy, can predict an eclipse, as it can predict recovery or death\r\nwhen it has used its genius and its clearness of vision, for a time,\r\nin the school of Hippocrates and at the bedside of the sick. By this\r\nline of observations and truths, we come to connect the admirable\r\npower of thought with matter, without being able to see the links,\r\nbecause the subject of this attribute is essentially unknown to us.\r\n\r\nLet us not say that every machine or every animal perishes altogether\r\nor assumes another form after death, for we know absolutely nothing\r\nabout the subject. On the other hand, to assert that an immortal\r\nmachine is a chimera or a logical fiction, is to reason as absurdly\r\nas caterpillars would reason if, seeing the cast-off skins of their\r\nfellow-caterpillars, they should bitterly deplore the fate of their\r\nspecies, which to them would seem to come to nothing. The soul of these\r\ninsects (for each animal has his own) is too limited to comprehend\r\nthe metamorphoses of nature. Never one of the most skilful among them\r\ncould have imagined that it was destined to become a butterfly. It\r\nis the same with us. What more do we know of our destiny than of our\r\norigin? Let us then submit to an invincible ignorance on which our\r\nhappiness depends.\r\n\r\nHe who so thinks will be wise, just, tranquil about his fate, and\r\ntherefore happy. He will await death without either fear or desire, and\r\nwill cherish life (hardly understanding how disgust can corrupt a heart\r\nin this place of many delights); he will be filled with reverence,\r\ngratitude, affection, and tenderness for nature, in proportion to his\r\nfeeling of the benefits he has received from nature; he will be happy,\r\nin short, in feeling nature, and in being present at the enchanting\r\nspectacle of the universe, and he will surely never destroy nature\r\neither in himself or in others. More than that! Full of humanity,\r\nthis man will love human character even in his enemies. Judge how he\r\nwill treat others. He will pity the wicked without hating them; in his\r\neyes, they will be but mis-made men. But in pardoning the faults of the\r\nstructure of mind and body, he will none the less admire the beauties\r\nand the virtues of both. Those whom nature shall have favored will\r\nseem to him to deserve more respect than those whom she has treated in\r\nstepmotherly fashion. Thus, as we have seen, natural gifts, the source\r\nof all acquirements, gain from the lips and heart of the materialist,\r\nthe homage which every other thinker unjustly refuses them. In short,\r\nthe materialist, convinced, in spite of the protests of his vanity,\r\nthat he is but a machine or an animal, will not maltreat his kind,\r\nfor he will know too well the nature of those actions, whose humanity\r\nis always in proportion to the degree of the analogy proved above\r\n[between human beings and animals]; and following the natural law\r\ngiven to all animals, he will not wish to do to others what he would\r\nnot wish them to do to him.\r\n\r\nLet us then conclude boldly that man is a machine, and that in\r\nthe whole universe there is but a single substance differently\r\nmodified. This is no hypothesis set forth by dint of a number of\r\npostulates and assumptions; it is not the work of prejudice, nor even\r\nof my reason alone; I should have disdained a guide which I think to\r\nbe so untrustworthy, had not my senses, bearing a torch, so to speak,\r\ninduced me to follow reason by lighting the way themselves. Experience\r\nhas thus spoken to me in behalf of reason; and in this way I have\r\ncombined the two.\r\n\r\nBut it must have been noticed that I have not allowed myself even the\r\nmost vigorous and immediately deduced reasoning, except as a result\r\nof a multitude of observations which no scholar will contest; and\r\nfurthermore, I recognize only scholars as judges of the conclusions\r\nwhich I draw from the observations; and I hereby challenge every\r\nprejudiced man who is neither anatomist, nor acquainted with the\r\nonly philosophy which can here be considered, that of the human\r\nbody. Against so strong and solid an oak, what could the weak reeds of\r\ntheology, of metaphysics, and of the schools, avail,--childish arms,\r\nlike our parlor foils, that may well afford the pleasure of fencing,\r\nbut can never wound an adversary. Need I say that I refer to the empty\r\nand trivial notions, to the pitiable and trite arguments that will be\r\nurged (as long as the shadow of prejudice or of superstition remains\r\non earth) for the supposed incompatibility of two substances which\r\nmeet and move each other unceasingly? Such is my system, or rather\r\nthe truth, unless I am much deceived. It is short and simple. Dispute\r\nit now who will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE NATURAL HISTORY OF THE SOUL.\r\n\r\n                     BY JEAN OFFRAY DE LA METTRIE.\r\n\r\n                               EXTRACTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. CONCERNING MATTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll philosophers who have examined attentively the nature of matter,\r\nconsidered in itself, independently of all the forms which constitute\r\nbodies, have discovered in this substance, diverse properties\r\nproceeding from an absolutely unknown essence. Such are, (1) the\r\ncapacity of taking on different forms, which are produced in matter\r\nitself, by which matter can acquire moving force and the faculty of\r\nfeeling; (2) actual extension, which these philosophers have rightly\r\nrecognized as an attribute, but not as the essence, of matter.\r\n\r\nHowever, there have been some, among others Descartes, who have\r\ninsisted on reducing the essence of matter to simple extension,\r\nand on limiting all the properties of matter to those of extension;\r\nbut this opinion has been rejected by all other modern philosophers,\r\n... so that the power of acquiring moving force, and the faculty\r\nof feeling as well as that of extension, have been from all time\r\nconsidered as essential properties{87} of matter.\r\n\r\nAll the diverse properties that are observed in this unknown principle\r\ndemonstrate a being in which these same properties exist, a being\r\nwhich must therefore exist through itself. But we can not conceive,\r\nor rather it seems impossible, that a being which exists through\r\nitself should be able neither to create nor to annihilate itself. It\r\nis evident that only the forms to which its essential properties\r\nmake it susceptible can be destroyed and reproduced in turn. Thus,\r\ndoes experience force us to confess that nothing can come from nothing.\r\n\r\nAll philosophers who have not known the light of faith, have thought\r\nthat this substantial principle of bodies has existed and will exist\r\nforever, and that the elements of matter have an indestructible\r\nsolidity which forbids the fear that the world is going to fall to\r\npieces. The majority of Christian philosophers also recognize that the\r\nsubstantial principle of bodies exists necessarily through itself,\r\nand that the power of beginning or ending does not accord with its\r\nnature. One finds that this view is upheld by an author of the last\r\ncentury who taught theology in Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. CONCERNING THE EXTENSION OF MATTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough we have no idea of the essence of matter, we can not refuse to\r\nadmit the existence of the properties which our senses discover in it.\r\n\r\nI open my eyes, and I see around me only matter, or the\r\nextended. Extension is then a property which always belongs to all\r\nmatter, which can belong to matter alone, and which therefore is\r\ninseparable from the substance of matter.\r\n\r\nThis property presupposes three dimensions in the substance of bodies,\r\nlength, width, and depth. Truly, if we consult our knowledge, which is\r\ngained entirely from the senses, we cannot conceive of matter, or the\r\nsubstance of bodies, without having the idea of a being which is at\r\nthe same time long, broad, and deep; because the idea of these three\r\ndimensions is necessarily bound up with our idea of every magnitude\r\nor quantity.\r\n\r\nThose philosophers who have meditated most concerning matter do not\r\nunderstand by the extension of this substance, a solid extension\r\ncomposed of distinct parts, capable of resistance. Nothing is united,\r\nnothing is divided in this extension; for there must be a force which\r\nseparates to divide, and another force to unite the divided parts. But\r\nin the opinion of these physical philosophers matter has no actually\r\nactive force, because every force can come only from movement, or from\r\nsome impulse or tendency toward movement, and they recognize in matter,\r\nstripped of all form by abstraction, only a potential moving force.\r\n\r\nThis theory is hard to conceive, but given its principles, it is\r\nrigorously true in its consequences. It is one of those algebraic\r\ntruths which is more readily believed than conceived by the mind.\r\n\r\nThe extension of matter is then but a metaphysical extension, which\r\naccording to the idea of these very philosophers, presents nothing to\r\naffect our senses. They rightly think that only solid extension can\r\nmake an impression on our senses. It thus seems to us that extension\r\nis an attribute which constitutes part of the metaphysical form,\r\nbut we are far from thinking that extension constitutes its essence.\r\n\r\nHowever, before Descartes, some of the ancients made the essence of\r\nmatter consist in solid extension. But this opinion, of which all the\r\nCartesians have made much, has at all times been victoriously combated\r\nby clear reasons, which we will set forth later, for order demands that\r\nwe first examine to what the properties of extension can be reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. CONCERNING THE MOVING FORCE OF MATTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ancients, persuaded that there is no body without a moving\r\nforce, regarded the substance of bodies as composed of two primitive\r\nattributes. It was held that, through one of these attributes, this\r\nsubstance has the capacity for moving and, through the other, the\r\ncapacity for being moved.{88} As a matter of fact, it is impossible\r\nnot to conceive these two attributes in every moving body, namely,\r\nthe thing which moves, and the same thing which is moved.\r\n\r\nIt has just been said that formerly the name, matter, was given to\r\nthe substance of bodies, in so far as it is susceptible of being\r\nmoved. When capable of moving this same matter was known by the name\r\nof \"active principle\".... But these two attributes seem to depend so\r\nessentially on each other that Cicero, in order better to state this\r\nessential and primitive union of matter with its moving principle,\r\nsays that each is found in the other. This expresses very well the\r\nidea of the ancients.\r\n\r\nFrom this it is clear that modern writers have given us but an inexact\r\nidea of matter in attempting (through a confusion ill understood)\r\nto give this name to the substance of bodies. For, once more, matter,\r\nor the passive principle of the substance of bodies, constitutes only\r\none part of this substance. Thus it is not surprising that these\r\nmodern thinkers have not discovered in matter moving force and the\r\nfaculty of feeling.\r\n\r\nIt should now be evident at the first glance, it seems to me, that\r\nif there is an active principle it must have, in the unknown essence\r\nof matter, another source than extension. This proves that simple\r\nextension fails to give an adequate idea of the complete essence or\r\nmetaphysical form of the substance of bodies, and that this failure is\r\ndue solely to the fact that extension excludes the idea of any activity\r\nin matter. Therefore, if we demonstrate this moving principle, if we\r\nshow that matter, far from being as indifferent as it is supposed\r\nto be, to movement and to rest, ought to be regarded as an active,\r\nas well as a passive substance, what resource can be left to those\r\nwho have made its essence consist in extension?\r\n\r\nThe two principles of which we have just spoken, extension and moving\r\nforce, are then but potentialities of the substance of bodies; for\r\nin the same way in which this substance is susceptible of movement,\r\nwithout actually being moved, it also has always, even when it is\r\nnot moving itself, the faculty of spontaneous motion.\r\n\r\nThe ancients have rightly noticed that this moving force acts in the\r\nsubstance of bodies only when the substance is manifested in certain\r\nforms; they have also observed that the different motions which it\r\nproduces are all subject to these different forms or regulated by\r\nthem. That is why the forms, through which the substance of bodies\r\ncan not only move, but also move in different ways, were called\r\nmaterial forms.\r\n\r\nOnce these early masters had cast their eyes on all the phenomena\r\nof nature, they discovered in the substance of bodies, the power\r\nof self-movement. In fact, this substance either moves itself, or\r\nwhen it is in motion, the motion is communicated to it by another\r\nsubstance. But can anything be seen in this substance, save the\r\nsubstance itself in action; and if sometimes it seems to receive a\r\nmotion that it has not, does it receive that motion from any cause\r\nother than this same kind of substance, whose parts act the one upon\r\nthe other?\r\n\r\nIf, then, one infers another agent, I ask what agent, and I demand\r\nproofs of its existence. But since no one has the least idea of such\r\nan agent, it is not even a logical entity. Therefore it is clear\r\nthat the ancients must have easily recognized an intrinsic force of\r\nmotion within the substance of bodies, since in fact it is impossible\r\nto prove or conceive any other substance acting upon it.\r\n\r\nDescartes, a genius made to blaze new paths and to go astray in them,\r\nsupposed with some other philosophers that God is the only efficient\r\ncause of motion, and that every instant He communicates motion to all\r\nbodies. But this opinion is but an hypothesis which he tried to adjust\r\nto the light of faith; and in so doing he was no longer attempting\r\nto speak as a philosopher or to philosophers. Above all he was not\r\naddressing those who can be convinced only by the force of evidence.\r\n\r\nThe Christian Scholastics of the last centuries have felt the full\r\nforce of this reflection; for this reason they have wisely limited\r\nthemselves to purely philosophic knowledge concerning the motion of\r\nmatter, although they might have shown that God Himself said that He\r\nhad \"imprinted an active principle in the elements of matter (Gen. i;\r\nIs. lxvi).\"\r\n\r\nOne might here make up a long list of authorities, and take from the\r\nmost celebrated professors the substance of the doctrine of all the\r\nrest; but it is clear enough, without a medley of citations, that\r\nmatter contains this moving force which animates it, and which is\r\nthe immediate cause of all the laws of motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. CONCERNING THE SENSITIVE FACULTY OF MATTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of two essential attributes of matter, upon which\r\ndepend the greater number of its properties, namely extension and\r\nmoving force. We have now but to prove a third attribute: I mean the\r\nfaculty of feeling which the philosophers of all centuries have found\r\nin this same substance. I say all philosophers, although I am not\r\nignorant of all the efforts which the Cartesians have made, in vain,\r\nto rob matter of this faculty. But in order to avoid insurmountable\r\ndifficulties, they have flung themselves into a labyrinth from which\r\nthey have thought to escape by this absurd system \"that animals are\r\npure machines.\"{89}\r\n\r\nAn opinion so absurd has never gained admittance among philosophers,\r\nexcept as the play of wit or as a philosophical pastime. For this\r\nreason we shall not stop to refute it. Experience gives us no less\r\nproof of the faculty of feeling in animals than of feeling in men....\r\n\r\nThere comes up another difficulty which more nearly concerns our\r\nvanity: namely, the impossibility of our conceiving this property as a\r\ndependence or attribute of matter. Let it not be forgotten that this\r\nsubstance reveals to us only ineffable characters. Do we understand\r\nbetter how extension is derived from its essence, how it can be moved\r\nby a primitive force whose action is exerted without contact, and a\r\nthousand other miracles so hidden from the gaze of the most penetrating\r\neyes, that (to paraphrase the idea of an illustrious modern writer)\r\nthey reveal only the curtain which conceals them?\r\n\r\nBut might not one suppose as some have supposed, that the feeling\r\nwhich is observed in animated bodies, might belong to a being distinct\r\nfrom the matter of these bodies, to a substance of a different nature\r\nunited to them? Does the light of reason allow us in good faith to\r\nadmit such conjectures? We know in bodies only matter, and we observe\r\nthe faculty of feeling only in bodies: on what foundation then can\r\nwe erect an ideal being, disowned by all our knowledge?\r\n\r\nHowever, we must admit, with the same frankness, that we are ignorant\r\nwhether matter has in itself the faculty of feeling, or only the power\r\nof acquiring it by those modifications or forms to which matter is\r\nsusceptible; for it is true that this faculty of feeling appears only\r\nin organic bodies.\r\n\r\nThis is then another new faculty which might exist only potentially\r\nin matter, like all the others which have been mentioned; and this was\r\nthe hypothesis of the ancients, whose philosophy, full of insight and\r\npenetration, deserves to be raised above the ruins of the philosophy\r\nof the moderns. It is in vain that the latter disdain the sources\r\ntoo remote from them. Ancient philosophy will always hold its own\r\namong those who are worthy to judge it, because it forms (at least\r\nin relation to the subject of which I am treating) a system that is\r\nsolid and well articulated like the body, whereas all these scattered\r\nmembers of modern philosophy form no system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX.\r\n\r\n                          OUTLINES AND NOTES.\r\n\r\n                       BY GERTRUDE CARMAN BUSSEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA METTRIE'S RELATION TO HIS PREDECESSORS AND TO HIS SUCCESSORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The Historical Relation of La Mettrie to René Descartes (1596-1650).\r\n\r\nThe most direct source of La Mettrie's work, if the physiological\r\naspect of his system is set aside, is found in the philosophy of\r\nDescartes. In fact it sometimes seems as if La Mettrie's materialism\r\ngrew out of his insistence on the contradictory character of the\r\ndualistic system of Descartes. He criticises Descartes's statement\r\nthat the body and soul are absolutely independent, and takes great\r\npains to show the dependence of the soul on the body. Yet though La\r\nMettrie's system may be opposed to that of Descartes [17] from one\r\npoint of view, from another point of view it seems to be a direct\r\nconsequence of it. La Mettrie himself recognizes this relationship and\r\nfeels that his doctrine that man is a machine, is a natural inference\r\nfrom Descartes's teaching that animals are mere machines. [18] Moreover\r\nLa Mettrie carries on Descartes's conception of the body as a machine,\r\nand many of his detailed discussions of the machinery of the body\r\nseem to have been drawn from Descartes.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that La Mettrie did justice to Descartes, and\r\nrealized how much all philosophers owed to him. He insisted moreover\r\nthat Descartes's errors were due to his failure to follow his own\r\nmethod. [19] Yet La Mettrie's method was different from that of\r\nDescartes, for La Mettrie was an empiricist [20] without rationalistic\r\nleaning. As regards doctrine: La Mettrie differed from Descartes in\r\nhis opinion of matter. Since he disbelieved in any spiritual reality,\r\nhe gave matter the attributes of motion and thought, while Descartes\r\ninsisted that the one attribute of matter is extension. [21] It\r\nwas a natural consequence of La Mettrie's disbelief in spiritual\r\nsubstance that he could throw doubt on the existence of God. [22]\r\nOn the other hand the belief in God was one of the foundations of\r\nDescartes's system. La Mettrie tried to show that Descartes's belief\r\nin a soul and in God was merely designed to hide his true thought\r\nfrom the priests, and to save himself from persecution. [23]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIIa. The Likeness of La Mettrie to the English Materialists, Thomas\r\nHobbes (1588-1679) and John Toland (1670-1721).\r\n\r\nThe influence of Descartes upon La Mettrie cannot be questioned but it\r\nis more difficult to estimate the influence upon him of materialistic\r\nphilosophers. Hobbes published \"The Leviathan\" in 1651 and \"De Corpore\"\r\nin 1655. Thus he wrote about a century before La Mettrie, and since\r\nthe eighteenth century was one in which the influence of England upon\r\nFrance was very great, it is easy to suppose that La Mettrie had read\r\nHobbes. If so, he must have gained many ideas from him. The extent\r\nof this influence is, however, unknown, for La Mettrie rarely if ever\r\nquotes from Hobbes, or attributes any of his doctrines to Hobbes.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, both Hobbes and La Mettrie are thoroughgoing\r\nmaterialists. They both believe that body is the only reality, and that\r\nanything spiritual is unimaginable. [24] Furthermore their conceptions\r\nof matter are very similar. According to La Mettrie, matter contains\r\nthe faculty of sensation and the power of motion as well as the\r\nquality of extension. [25] This same conception of matter is held by\r\nHobbes, for he specifically attributes extension and motion to matter,\r\nand then reduces sensation to a kind of internal motion. [26] Thus\r\nsensation also may be an attribute of matter. Moreover Hobbes and\r\nLa Mettrie are in agreement on many smaller points, and La Mettrie\r\nelaborates much that is suggested in Hobbes. They both believe that\r\nthe passions are dependent on bodily conditions. [27] They agree in\r\nthe belief that all the differences in men are due to differences\r\nin the constitution and organization of their bodies. [28] They both\r\ndiscuss the nature and importance of language. [29]\r\n\r\nHobbes differs from La Mettrie in holding that we can be sure that God\r\nexists as the cause of this world. [30] However even though he thinks\r\nthat it is possible to know that God exists, he does not believe that\r\nwe can know his nature.\r\n\r\nLa Mettrie's system may be regarded as the application of a system like\r\nthat of Hobbes to the special problem of the relation of soul and body\r\nin man; for if there is nothing in the universe but matter and motion,\r\nit inevitably follows that man is merely a very complicated machine.\r\n\r\nThere is great similarity also between the doctrine of La Mettrie and\r\nthat of Toland. It is interesting to note the points of resemblance\r\nand of difference. Toland's \"Letters to Serena,\" which contain much\r\nof his philosophical teaching, were published in 1704. There is\r\na possibility therefore that La Mettrie read them and gained some\r\nsuggestions from them.\r\n\r\nThe point most emphasized in Toland's teaching [31] is that motion\r\nis an attribute of matter. He argues for this belief on the ground\r\nthat matter must be essentially active in order to undergo change,\r\n[32] and that the conception of the inertness of matter is based\r\non the conception of absolute rest, and that this absolute rest\r\nis nowhere to be found. [33] Since motion is essential to matter,\r\nthere is no need, Toland believes, to account for the beginning of\r\nmotion. Those who have regarded matter as inert have had to find some\r\nefficient cause for motion, and to do this, they have held that all\r\nnature is animated. But this pretended animation is utterly useless,\r\nsince matter is itself endowed with motion. [34] The likeness to\r\nLa Mettrie is evident. La Mettrie likewise opposes the doctrine of\r\nthe animation of matter, and the belief in any external cause of\r\nmotion. [35] Yet he feels the need of postulating some beginning\r\nof motion, [36] and although he uses the conception so freely, he\r\ndoes not agree with Toland that the nature of motion is known. He\r\nbelieves that it is impossible to know the nature of motion, [37]\r\nwhile Toland believes that the nature of motion is self-evident. [38]\r\n\r\nAnother point of contrast between Toland and La Mettrie is in\r\ntheir doctrines of God. Toland believes that God, \"a pure spirit\r\nor immaterial being,\" is necessary for his system, [39] while La\r\nMettrie questions God's existence and insists that immateriality and\r\nspirituality are fine words that no one understands.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted, in truth, that La Mettrie and Toland have\r\ndifferent interests and different points of view. Toland is concerned\r\nto discover the essential nature of matter, while La Mettrie's problem\r\nis to find the specific relation of body and mind. On this relation,\r\nhe builds his whole system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nb. The Relation of La Mettrie to an English Sensationalist: John Locke\r\n(1632-1704).\r\n\r\nLocke's \"Essay Concerning Human Understanding\" was published in 1690,\r\nand La Mettrie, like most cultured Frenchmen of the Enlightenment,\r\nwas influenced by his teaching. The main agreement between Locke\r\nand La Mettrie is in their doctrine that all ideas are derived from\r\nsensation. Both vigorously oppose the belief in innate ideas, [40]\r\nteaching that even our most complex and our most abstract ideas are\r\ngained through sensation. But La Mettrie does not follow Locke in\r\nanalyzing these ideas and in concluding that many sensible qualities\r\nof objects--such as colors, sounds, etc.--have no existence outside\r\nthe mind. [41] He rejects Locke's doctrine of spiritual substances,\r\n[42] and opposes Locke's theistic teaching, laying stress, on the\r\nother hand, upon Locke's admission of the possibility that \"thinking\r\nbeing may also be material.\" [43]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIIIa. The Likeness, probable but unacknowledged, to La Mettrie, of\r\nthe French Sensationalists, Etienne Bonnot de Condillac (1715-1780)\r\nand Claude Adrien Helvetius (1715-1771).\r\n\r\nCondillac's \"Traité des sensations\" was published about ten years\r\nafter La Mettrie's \"L'histoire naturelle de l'âme,\" and therefore it\r\nis probable that Condillac had read this work, and gained some ideas\r\nfrom it. Yet Condillac never mentions La Mettrie's name nor cites\r\nhis doctrines. This omission may be accounted for by the fact that\r\nthe works of La Mettrie had been so condemned that later philosophers\r\nwished to conceal the similarity of their doctrines to his. Whether\r\nthe sensationalists were influenced by his teachings or not, there\r\nis such a profound likeness in their teachings, that La Mettrie may\r\nwell be regarded as one of the first French sensationalists as well\r\nas one of the leading French materialists of the time.\r\n\r\nCondillac and La Mettrie agree that experience is the source of all\r\nknowledge. As Lange suggests, [44] La Mettrie's development of reason\r\nfrom the imagination may have suggested to Condillac the way to develop\r\nall the faculties from the soul. La Mettrie asserts that reason is but\r\nthe sensitive soul contemplating its ideas, and that imagination plays\r\nall the rôles of the soul, while Condillac elaborates the same idea,\r\nand shows in great detail how all the faculties of the soul are but\r\nmodifications of sensation. [45]\r\n\r\nBoth La Mettrie and Condillac believe that there is no gulf between\r\nman and the lower animals; but this leads to a point of disagreement\r\nbetween the two philosophers, for Condillac absolutely denies that\r\nanimals can be mere machines, [46] and we must suppose that he\r\nwould the more ardently oppose the teaching that man is merely a\r\ncomplicated machine! Condillac finally, unlike La Mettrie, believes\r\nin the existence of God. A final point of contrast also concerns the\r\ntheology of the two writers. La Mettrie insists that we can not be sure\r\nthat there is any purpose in the world, while Condillac affirms that\r\nwe can discern intelligence and design throughout the universe. [47]\r\n\r\nLike La Mettrie and Condillac, Helvetius teaches that all the faculties\r\nof the mind can be reduced to sensation. [48] Unlike La Mettrie,\r\nhe specifically distinguishes the mind from the soul, and describes\r\nthe mind as a later developed product of the soul or faculty of\r\nsensation. [49] This idea may have been suggested by La Mettrie's\r\nstatement that reason is a modification of sensation. Helvetius,\r\nhowever, unlike La Mettrie, does not clearly decide that sensation\r\nis but a result of bodily conditions, and he admits that sensation\r\nmay be a modification of a spiritual substance. [50] Moreover, he\r\nclaims that climate and food have no effect on the mind, and that the\r\nsuperiority of the understanding is not dependent on the strength of\r\nthe body and its organs. [51]\r\n\r\nLa Mettrie and Helvetius resemble each other in ethical doctrine. Both\r\nmake pleasure and pain the ruling motives of man's conduct. They claim\r\nthat all the emotions are merely modifications of corporeal pleasure\r\nand pain, and that therefore the only principle of action in man is\r\nthe desire for pleasure and the fear of pain. [52]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nb. The Likeness to La Mettrie of the French Materialist, Baron Paul\r\nHeinrich Dietrich von Holbach (1723-1789).\r\n\r\nAs Condillac and Helvetius emphasize the sensationalism taught by La\r\nMettrie, so Holbach's book is a reiteration and elaboration of the\r\nmaterialism set forth in La Mettrie's works. The teaching of Holbach\r\nis so like that of La Mettrie, that the similarity can hardly be\r\na coincidence.\r\n\r\nLa Mettrie regards experience as the only teacher. Holbach dwells\r\non this same idea, and insists that experience is our only source\r\nof knowledge in all matters. [53] Holbach likewise teaches that man\r\nis a purely material being. He disbelieves in any spiritual reality\r\nwhatsoever, and makes matter the only substance in the world. He lays\r\nstress, also, on one thought which is a natural consequence of La\r\nMettrie's teaching. La Mettrie has limited the action of the will and\r\nhas insisted that the will is dependent on bodily conditions. Holbach\r\ngoes further and declares repeatedly that all freedom is a delusion,\r\nand that man is controlled in every action by rigid necessity. [54]\r\nThis teaching seems to be the natural outcome of the belief that man\r\nis a machine.\r\n\r\nHolbach's atheistic theology is more extreme than his predecessor's,\r\nfor La Mettrie admits that God may exist, while Holbach vigorously\r\nopposes the possibility. Moreover Holbach holds the opinion,\r\nbarely suggested by La Mettrie, that an atheistic doctrine would\r\nameliorate the condition of mankind. [55] He insists that the idea\r\nof God has hindered the progress of reason and interfered with\r\nnatural law. Holbach is indeed the only one of the philosophers here\r\ndiscussed, who frankly adopts a fatalistic and atheistic doctrine of\r\nthe universe. In these respects, his teaching is the culmination of\r\nFrench materialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTLINE OF LA METTRIE'S METAPHYSICAL DOCTRINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                            PAGES [56]\r\n\r\nI.

[57]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE ON FREDERICK THE GREAT'S EULOGY.\r\n\r\nThis translation is made from the third volume, pp. 159 ff. of \"OEuvres\r\nde Fréderic II., Roi de Prusse, Publiées du vivant de l'Auteur,\"\r\nBerlin, 1789.\r\n\r\nLa Mettrie was received at the court of Frederick the Great, when he\r\nhad been driven from Holland on account of the heretical teaching of\r\n\"L'Homme Machine,\" The \"Eloge\" was read by Darget, the secretary of\r\nthe king, at a public meeting of the Academy of Berlin, to which,\r\nat the initiative of Frederick, La Mettrie had been admitted.\r\n\r\nThe careful reader will not fail to note that Frederick's arithmetic\r\nis at fault, and that La Mettrie died at the age of forty-one, not\r\nforty-three, years.\r\n\r\nAt a few points, perhaps, the Eloge demands elucidation. Coutances,\r\nlike Caen, is a Norman town. St. Malo lies, just over the border,\r\nin Brittany. La Mettrie's military service was with the French in\r\nthe Silesian wars against Maria Theresa. The battle of Dettingen was\r\nfought in Bavaria and was won by the Austrians through the aid given\r\nby George II of England to Maria Theresa. The battle of Fontenoy in\r\nthe Netherlands was the only victory of the French in this war.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther accounts of the life of La Mettrie are:\r\n\r\nJ. Assézat, Introduction to \"L'Homme Machine,\" Paris, 1865.\r\n\r\nF. A. Lange, \"History of Materialism.\"\r\n\r\nPh. Damiron, \"Histoire de la philosophie du dix-huitième siècle,\"\r\nParis, 1858.\r\n\r\nN. Quépat, \"La philosophie matérialiste au XVIIIe siècle. Essai sur\r\nLa Mettrie, sa vie, et ses oeuvres.\" Paris, 1873.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES ON MAN A MACHINE.\r\n\r\n1. \"Matter may well be endowed with the faculty of thought.\" Although\r\nLa Mettrie attempts to \"avoid this reef,\" by refraining from the use\r\nof these words, yet he asserts throughout his work that sensations,\r\nconsciousness, and the soul itself are modifications of matter\r\nand motion.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of matter being endowed with the faculty of thought,\r\nis denied by Elie Luzac, the publisher of \"L'homme machine,\" in his\r\nwork \"L'homme plus que machine.\" In this work he tries to disprove the\r\nconclusions of \"L'homme machine.\" He says: \"We have therefore proved\r\nby the idea of the inert state of matter, by that of motion, by that\r\nof relations, by that of activity, by that of extension, that matter\r\ncan not be possessed of the faculty of thinking\".... \"To be brief,\r\nI say, that if, by a material substance, we understand that matter\r\nwhich falls under the cognizance of our senses, and which is endowed\r\nwith the qualities we have mentioned, the soul can not be material:\r\nso that it must be immaterial, and, for the same reason, God could\r\nnot have given the faculty of thinking to matter, since He can not\r\nperform contradictions.\" [58]\r\n\r\n2. \"How can we define a being whose nature is absolutely unknown to\r\nus?\" La Mettrie uses this as an argument against the belief in a soul,\r\nand yet he later admits that the \"nature of motion is as unknown to\r\nus as the nature of matter.\" It is difficult then to see why there\r\nis more reason to doubt the existence of spirit, than to doubt the\r\nexistence of matter. Locke makes this point very well. \"It is for want\r\nof reflection that we are apt to think that our senses show us nothing\r\nbut material things. Every act of sensation, when duly considered,\r\ngives us an equal view of both parts of nature, the corporeal and\r\nspiritual.\" [59]... \"If this notion of immaterial spirit may have,\r\nperhaps, some difficulties in it not easy to be explained, we have\r\ntherefore no more reason to deny or doubt the existence of such\r\nspirits, than we have to deny or doubt the existence of body because\r\nthe notion of body is cumbered with some difficulties, very hard and\r\nperhaps impossible to be explained or understood by us.\" [60]\r\n\r\n3. \"Author of the 'Spectacle de la nature.'\" Noel Antoine Pluche\r\n(1688-1761) was a Jansenist author. He was Director of the College\r\nof Laon, but was deprived of his position on account of his refusal\r\nto adhere to the bull \"Unigenitus.\" Rollin then recommended him to\r\nGasville, intendant of Normandy, who entrusted him with his son's\r\neducation. He finally settled in Paris. His principal works are:\r\n\"Spectacle de la nature,\" (Paris, 1739); \"Mécanique des langues et\r\nl'art de les enseigner,\" (Paris, 1751); \"Harmonie des Psaumes et de\r\nl'Evangile,\" (Paris, 1764); \"Concorde de la géographie des différents\r\nages,\" (Paris, 1765). [61]\r\n\r\nLa Mettrie describes Pluche in the \"Essais sur l'esprit et les beaux\r\nesprits\" thus: \"Without wit, without taste, he is Rollin's pedant. A\r\nsuperficial man, he had need of the work of M. Réaumur, of whom he\r\nis only a stale and tiresome imitator in the flat little sayings\r\nscattered in his dialogues. It was with the works of Rollin as with\r\nthe 'Spectacle de la Nature,' one made the fortune of the other:\r\nGaçon praised Person, Person praised Gaçon, and the public praised\r\nthem both.\" [62]\r\n\r\nThis quotation from La Mettrie occurs in Assézat's edition of La\r\nMettrie's \"L'homme machine,\" which was published as the second\r\nvolume of the series \"Singularités physiologiques\" (1865). Assézat\r\nwas a French publisher and writer. He was at one time Secretary of\r\nthe Anthropological Society, and collaborated with other writers\r\nin the publication of \"La Revue Nationale,\" \"La Revue de Paris,\"\r\nand \"La Pensée nouvelle.\" His notes to \"L'Homme Machine\" show great\r\nknowledge concerning physiological subjects. He intended to publish a\r\ncomplete edition of Diderot's works, but overwork on this undermined\r\nhis health, so that he was unable to complete it. [63]\r\n\r\n4. Torricelli was a physicist and mathematician who lived from 1608\r\nto 1647. He was a disciple of Galileo, and acted as his amanuensis\r\nfor three months before Galileo's death. He was then nominated\r\nas grand-ducal mathematician and professor of mathematics in the\r\nFlorentine Academy. In 1643, he made his most famous discovery. He\r\nfound that the height to which a liquid will rise in a closed tube,\r\ndepends on the specific gravity of the liquid, and concludes from this\r\nthat the column of liquid is sustained by atmospheric pressure. This\r\ndiscovery did away with the obscure idea of a fuga vacui, and laid\r\nbare the principle on which mercurial barometers are constructed. For\r\na long time the mercurial thermometer was called the \"Torricellian\r\ntube,\" and the vacuum which the barometer includes is still known as a\r\n\"Torricellian vacuum.\" [64]\r\n\r\n5. \"Only the physicians have a right to speak on this subject.\" Luzac\r\nsays: \"'Tis true that if the materiality of the soul was proved,\r\nthe knowledge of her would be an object of natural philosophy, and\r\nwe might with some appearance of reason reject all arguments to the\r\ncontrary which are not drawn from that science. But if the soul is not\r\nmaterial, the investigation of its nature does not belong to natural\r\nphilosophy, but to those who search into the nature of its faculties,\r\nand are called metaphysicians.\" [65]\r\n\r\n6. \"Man is ... a machine.\" This is the first clear statement of this\r\ntheory, which as the title of the work indicates, is the central\r\ndoctrine of this work. Descartes had strongly denied the possibility\r\nof conceiving man as a machine. \"We may easily conceive a machine\r\nto be so constructed that it emits vocables, and even that it emits\r\nsome correspondent to the action upon it of external objects which\r\ncause a change in its organs,... but not that it should emit them\r\nvariously so as appositely to reply to what is said in its presence,\r\nas men of the lowest grade of intellect can do.\" [66]\r\n\r\n7. \"Let us then take in our hands the staff of experience.\" La\r\nMettrie repeatedly emphasizes the belief that knowledge must come from\r\nexperience. Moreover he confines this experience to sense experience,\r\nand concludes \"L'histoire naturelle de l'âme\" with these words:\r\n\"No senses, no ideas. The fewer senses there are: the fewer ideas. No\r\nsensations experienced, no ideas. These principles are the necessary\r\nconsequence of all the observations and experiences that constitute\r\nthe unassailable foundation of this work.\"\r\n\r\nThis doctrine is opposed to the teaching of Descartes, who insists\r\nthat \"neither our imagination nor our senses can give us assurance of\r\nanything unless our understanding intervene.\" [67] Moreover Descartes\r\nbelieves that the senses are fallacious, and that the ideal method\r\nfor philosophy is a method corresponding to that of mathematics. [68]\r\nCondillac and Holbach agree with La Mettrie's opinion. Thus, Condillac\r\nteaches that man is nothing more than what he has become by the use\r\nof his senses. [69] And Holbach says: \"As soon as we take leave of\r\nexperience, we fall into the chasm where our imagination leads us\r\nastray.\" [70]\r\n\r\n8. \"Galen (Galenus) Claudius, 130 to circa 210 A. D. An eminent\r\nGreek physician and philosopher. Born at Pergamus, Mysia, he studied\r\nboth the Platonic and Peripatetic systems of philosophy. Satyrus\r\ninstructed him in anatomy. He traveled extensively while young to\r\nperfect his education. About 165 A. D. he moved to Rome, and became\r\nvery celebrated as a surgeon and practising physician, attending\r\nthe family of Marcus Aurelius. He returned to Pergamus, but probably\r\nvisited Rome three or four times afterwards. He wrote in philosophy,\r\nlogic, and medicine. Many, probably most, of his works are lost. He\r\nwas the one medical authority for thirteen centuries, and his services\r\nto logic and to philosophy were also great.\" [71]\r\n\r\n9. The author of \"L'histoire de l'âme\" is La Mettrie himself.\r\n\r\n10. Hippocrates is often termed the \"father of medicine.\" He was\r\nborn in Cos in 460 B. C. He studied medicine under his father,\r\nHeraclides, and Herodicus of Selymbria; and philosophy under Gorgias\r\nand Democritus. He was the first to separate medicine from religion\r\nand from philosophy. He insisted that diseases must be treated by\r\nthe physician, as if they were governed by purely natural laws. The\r\nGreeks had such respect for dead bodies that Hippocrates could not\r\nhave dissected a human body, and consequently his knowledge of its\r\nstructure was limited, but he seems to have been an acute and skilful\r\nobserver of conditions in the living body. He wrote several works on\r\nmedicine, and in one of them showed the first principles on which the\r\npublic health must be based. The details of his life are hidden by\r\ntradition, but it is certain that he was regarded with great respect\r\nand veneration by the Greeks. [72]\r\n\r\n11. \"The different combinations of these humors....\" Compare this\r\nwith Descartes's statement that the difference in men comes from the\r\ndifference in the construction and position of the brain, which causes\r\na difference in the action of the animal spirits. [73]\r\n\r\n12. \"This drug intoxicates, like wine, coffee, etc., each in its own\r\nmeasure, and according to the dose.\" Descartes also speaks of the\r\neffect of wine. \"The vapors of wine, entering the blood quickly, go\r\nfrom the heart to the brain, where they are converted into spirits,\r\nwhich being stronger and more abundant than usual are capable of\r\nmoving the body in several strange fashions.\" [74]\r\n\r\n13. The quotation from Pope is from the \"Moral Essays,\" published\r\n1731 to 1735, Epistle I, 1, 69.\r\n\r\n14. Jan Baptista Van Helmont (1578-1644) was a Flemish physician and\r\nchemist. He is noted for having demonstrated the necessity of the\r\nbalance in chemistry, and for having been among the first to use the\r\nword \"gas.\" His works were published as \"Ortus Medicinae,\" 1648. [75]\r\n\r\n15. The author of \"Lettres sur la physiognomie\" was Jacques Pernety\r\nor Pernetti. He was born at Chazelle-sur-Lyon, was for some years\r\ncanon at Lyons, and died there in 1777. [76]\r\n\r\n16. Boerhaave. See Note 78.\r\n\r\n17. Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis (1698-1759) was a French\r\nmathematician, astronomer and philosopher. He supported the Newtonian\r\ntheory against the Cartesians. In 1740 he became president of the\r\nAcademy of Berlin. He was the head of the expedition which was sent\r\nby Louis XV to measure a degree of longitude in Lapland. Voltaire\r\nsatirized Maupertuis in the \"Diatribe du Docteur Akakia.\" [77]\r\n\r\n18. Luzac sums up the preceding facts by saying: \"Here are a great\r\nmany facts, but what is it they prove? only that the faculties of the\r\nsoul arise, grow, and acquire strength in proportion as the body does;\r\nso that these same faculties are weakened in the same proportion as\r\nthe body is.... But from all these circumstances it does not follow\r\nthat the faculty of thinking is an attribute of matter, and that all\r\ndepends on the manner in which our machine is made, that the faculties\r\nof the soul arise from a principle of animal life, from an innate\r\nheat or force, from an irritability of the finest parts of the body,\r\nfrom a subtil ethereal matter diffused through it, or in a word,\r\nfrom all these things taken together.\" [78]\r\n\r\n19. \"The diverse states of the soul are therefore always correlative\r\nwith those of the body.\" This view is in diametrical opposition to\r\nthe teaching of Descartes, who says: \"The soul is of a nature wholly\r\nindependent of the body.\" [79] Yet Descartes also states that there is\r\nan intimate connection between the two. \"The Reasonable Soul ... could\r\nby no means be educed from the power of matter ... it must be expressly\r\ncreated; and it is not sufficient that it be lodged in the human body,\r\nexactly like a pilot in a ship, unless perhaps to move its members,\r\nbut ... it is necessary for it to be joined and united more closely to\r\nthe body, in order to have sensations and appetites similar to ours,\r\nand thus constitute a real man.\" [79]\r\n\r\nHolbach later emphasizes this close connection between body and soul,\r\nwhich is so insisted upon by La Mettrie. \"If freed from our prejudices\r\nwe wish to see our soul, or the moving principle which acts in us, we\r\nshall remain convinced that it is part of our body, that it can not\r\nbe distinguished from the body except by an abstraction, that it is\r\nbut the body itself considered relatively to some of the functions\r\nor faculties to which its nature and particular organization make\r\nit susceptible. We shall see that this soul is forced to undergo\r\nthe same changes as the body, that it grows and develops with the\r\nbody.... Finally we can not help recognizing that at some periods it\r\nshows evident signs of weakness, sickness, and death.\" [80]\r\n\r\n20. \"Peyronie (François Gigot de la), a French surgeon, born in\r\nMontpellier, the fifteenth of January, 1678, died the twenty-fifth\r\nof April, 1747. He was surgeon of the hospital of Saint-Eloi de\r\nMontpellier and instructor of anatomy to the Faculty; then, in 1704,\r\nserved in the army. In 1717 he became reversioner of the position of\r\nfirst surgeon to Louis XV; in 1731, steward of the Queen's palace;\r\nin 1735, a doctor of the King; in 1736, first surgeon of the King,\r\nand chief of the surgeons of the kingdom. The greatest merit of\r\nLa Peyronie is for having founded the Academy of Surgery in Paris,\r\nand for having gained special protection for surgery and surgeons in\r\nFrance. He wrote little.\" [81]\r\n\r\n21. \"Willis, Thomas (1621-1675), English physician, was born at Great\r\nBedwin, Wiltshire, on 27th January, 1621. He studied at Christ Church,\r\nOxford; and when that city was garrisoned for the king he bore arms\r\nfor the Royalists. He took the degree of bachelor of medicine in 1646,\r\nand after the surrender of the garrison applied himself to the practice\r\nof his profession. In 1660, shortly after the Restoration, he became\r\nSedleian professor of natural philosophy in place of Dr. Joshua Cross,\r\nwho was ejected, and the same year he took the degree of doctor of\r\nphysic.... He was one of the first members of the Royal Society, and\r\nwas elected an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in\r\n1664. In 1666, ... he removed to Westminster, on the invitation of\r\nDr. Sheldon, Archbishop of Canterbury.... He died at St. Martin's on\r\n11th November, 1675, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.\" [82]\r\n\r\n22. \"Fontenelle, Bernard le Bovier de. Born at Rouen, France,\r\nFebruary 11, 1657; died at Paris, January 9, 1757. A French advocate,\r\nphilosopher, poet, and miscellaneous writer. He was the nephew (through\r\nhis mother) of Corneille, and was 'one of the last of the Précieux, or\r\nrather the inventor of a new combination of literature and gallantry\r\nwhich at first exposed him to not a little satire' (Saintsbury). He\r\nwrote 'Poésies pastorales' (1688), 'Dialogues des morts' (1683),\r\n'Entretiens sur la pluralité des mondes' (1686), 'Histoire des oracles'\r\n(1687), 'Eloges des académiciens' (delivered 1690-1740).\" [83]\r\n\r\n23. \"In a word, would it be absolutely impossible to teach the ape a\r\nlanguage? I do not think so.\" Compare with this Haeckel's statement\r\nof the relation between man's speech and that of apes. \"It is of\r\nespecial interest that the speech of apes seems on physiological\r\ncomparison to be a stage in the formation of articulate human\r\nspeech. Among living apes there is an Indian species which is musical;\r\nthe hylobates syndactylus sings a full octave in perfectly pure\r\nharmonious half-tones. No impartial philologist can hesitate any\r\nlonger to admit that our elaborate rational language has been slowly\r\nand gradually developed out of the imperfect speech of our Pliocene\r\nsimian ancestors.\" [84]\r\n\r\n24. Johann Conrad Amman was born at Schaffhausen, in Switzerland,\r\nin 1669. After his graduation at Basle, he practised medicine at\r\nAmsterdam. He devoted most of his attention to the instruction of deaf\r\nmutes. He taught them by attracting their attention to the motion of\r\nhis lips, tongue, and larynx, while he was speaking, and by persuading\r\nthem to imitate these motions. In this way, they finally learned to\r\narticulate syllables and words, and to talk. In his works \"Surdus\r\nLoquens,\" and \"Dissertatio de Loquela,\" he explained the mechanism of\r\nspeech, and made public his method of instruction. From all accounts\r\nit seems that his success with the deaf mutes was remarkable. He died\r\nabout 1730. [85]\r\n\r\n25. \"... the great analogy between ape and man....\" Compare Haeckel:\r\n\"Thus comparative anatomy proves to the satisfaction of every\r\nunprejudiced and critical student the significant fact that the body of\r\nman and that of the anthropoid ape are not only peculiarly similar, but\r\nthey are practically one and the same in every important respect.\" [86]\r\n\r\n26. Sir William Temple was born in London in 1628. He attended the\r\nPuritan College of Emmanuel, Cambridge, but left without taking\r\nhis degree. After an extensive tour on the continent, he settled\r\nin Ireland in 1655. His political career began with the accession\r\nof Charles II in 1660. He is particularly noted for concluding \"The\r\nTriple Alliance\" between England, the United Netherlands, and Sweden,\r\nand for his part in bringing about the marriage of William and Mary,\r\nwhich completed the alliance of England and the Netherlands. Temple\r\nwas not as successful in political work at home as abroad, for he was\r\ntoo honest to care to be concerned in the intrigues in English affairs,\r\nat that time. He retired from politics and died at Moor Park in 1699.\r\n\r\nTemple wrote several works on political subjects. His \"Memoirs\" were\r\nbegun in 1682; the first part was destroyed before it was published,\r\nthe second part was published without his consent, and the third part\r\nwas published by Swift after Temple's death. His fame rests more on\r\nhis diplomatic work than on his writings. [87]\r\n\r\n27. \"Trembley (Abraham) a Swiss naturalist, born in Geneva, the third\r\nof September, 1700, died in Geneva, the twelfth of May, 1784. He\r\nwas educated in his native city, and in the Hague, where he became\r\ntutor of the son of an English resident, and later the tutor of\r\nthe young duke of Richmond, with whom he traveled in Germany and\r\nItaly. In 1760, he obtained the position of librarian at Geneva,\r\nand gained a seat in the council of the 'Two Hundred.' His admirable\r\nworks on the fresh-water snake procured for him his election as\r\nmember of the Royal Society of London, and as correspondent of the\r\nAcademy of Sciences in Paris. From 1775 to 1782 he published several\r\nworks on natural religion, and articles on natural history in the\r\n'Philosophical Transactions,' 1742-57. His most important work is\r\n'Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire d'un genre de polype d'eau douce'\r\n(Leyden, 1744; Paris, 2 volumes).\" [88]\r\n\r\n28. \"What was man before the invention of words and the knowledge\r\nof language? An animal.\" Compare this with the statement of Hobbes:\r\n\"The most noble and profitable invention of all others was that of\r\nSpeech, consisting of names or appellations, and their connexion,\r\n... without which there had been amongst men neither commonwealth,\r\nnor society, nor contract, nor peace, no more than amongst lions,\r\nbears, and wolves.\" [89]\r\n\r\n29. Fontenelle. See note 22.\r\n\r\n30. \"All the faculties of the soul can be correctly reduced to\r\npure imagination.\" Compare with this La Mettrie's statement in\r\n\"L'histoire naturelle de l'âme\": \"The more one studies all the\r\nintellectual faculties, the more convinced one remains, that they\r\nare all included in the faculty of sensation, upon which they all\r\ndepend so essentially that without it the soul could never perform\r\nany of its functions.\" [90] This resembles Condillac's doctrine of\r\nsensation: \"Judgment, reflexion, desires, passions, etc., are nothing\r\nbut sensation itself which is transformed in diverse ways.\" [91]\r\nHelvetius also says: \"All the operations of the mind are reducible\r\nto sensation.\" [92]\r\n\r\n31. \"See to what one is brought by the abuse of language, and\r\nby the use of those fine words (spirituality, immateriality,\r\netc.).\" Compare Hobbes, \"Though men may put together words of\r\ncontradictory signification, as spirit and incorporeal; yet they can\r\nnever have the imagination of anything answering to them.\" [93]\r\n\r\n32. \"Man's preëminent advantage is his organism.\" Luzac says: \"This\r\nno more proves that organization is the chief merit of man, than\r\nthat the form of a musical instrument constitutes the chief merit\r\nof the musician. In proportion to the goodness of the instrument,\r\nthe musician charms by his art, and the case is the same with the\r\nsoul. In proportion to the soundness of the body, the soul is in\r\nbetter condition to exert her faculties.\" [94]\r\n\r\n33. \"Such is, I think, the generation of intelligence.\" Luzac argues\r\nagainst this statement thus: \"But if thought and all the faculties\r\nof the soul depended only on the organization as some pretend, how\r\ncould the imagination draw a long chain of consequences from the\r\nobjects it has embraced?\" [95]\r\n\r\n34. Pyrrhonism is \"the doctrine of Pyrrho of Elis which has been\r\ntransmitted chiefly by his disciple Timon. More generally, radical\r\nScepticism in general.\" [96]\r\n\r\n35. Pierre Bayle was born at Carlat in 1647. Although the child\r\nof Protestant parents, he was converted by the Jesuits. After his\r\nreconversion to Protestantism, he was driven out of France, and\r\ntook refuge first in Geneva, and then in Holland. In 1675 he became\r\nprofessor of philosophy at the Protestant College of Sedan, and in\r\n1681 professor of philosophy and history at Rotterdam. In 1693 he was\r\nforced to resign from his position on account of his religious views.\r\n\r\nBayle was one of the leading French sceptics of the time. He was a\r\nCartesian, but questioned both the certainty of one's own existence,\r\nand the knowledge derived from it. He declared that religion is\r\ncontrary to the human reason, but that this fact does not necessarily\r\ndestroy faith. He distinguished religion not only from science, but\r\nalso from morality, and vigorously opposed those who considered a\r\ncertain religion necessary for morality. He did not openly attack\r\nChristianity, yet all that he wrote awakened doubt, and his work\r\nexerted an extensive influence for scepticism.\r\n\r\nHis principal work is the \"Dictionnaire historique et critique,\"\r\npublished 1695-1697, and containing a vast amount of knowledge,\r\nexpressed in a piquant and popular style. This fact made the book\r\nwidely read both by scholars and by superficial readers.\r\n\r\n36. Arnobius the Elder was born at Sicca Venerea in Numidia, in the\r\nlatter part of the third century A. D. He was at first an opponent of\r\nChristianity, but was afterwards converted, and wrote \"Adversus Gentes\"\r\nas an apology for Christianity. In this work, he tries to answer the\r\ncomplaints made against Christians on the ground that the disasters\r\nof the time were due to their impiety; vindicates the divinity of\r\nChrist; and discusses the nature of the human soul. He concludes\r\nthat the soul is not immortal, for he believes that the belief in\r\nthe immortality of the soul would have a deteriorating influence\r\non morality. For translation of his work compare Vol. XIX of the\r\n\"Ante-Nicene Christian Library.\" [97]\r\n\r\n37. \"There exists no soul or sensitive substance without\r\nremorse.\" Condillac had said: \"There is something in animals besides\r\nmotion. They are not pure machines: they feel.\" [98] La Mettrie also\r\nattributed remorse to animals, but believed that they are none the\r\nless machines. Luzac said in comment: \"What renders these systems\r\ncompletely ridiculous, is, that the persons who pronounce men machines,\r\ngive them properties which belie their assertion. If beings are but\r\nmachines, why do they grant a natural law, an internal sense, a kind\r\nof dread? These are ideas which can not be excited by objects which\r\noperate on our senses.\" [99]\r\n\r\n38. \"Nature has created us solely to be happy.\" This is a statement of\r\nthe doctrine, which La Mettrie develops in his principal ethical work\r\n\"Discours sur le Bonheur.\" He teaches that happiness rests upon bodily\r\npleasure and pain. In \"L'histoire naturelle de l'âme,\" La Mettrie\r\nstates that all the passions can be developed from two fundamental\r\npassions, of which they are but modifications, love and hatred, or\r\ndesire and aversion. [100] Like La Mettrie, Helvetius makes corporeal\r\npleasure and pain the ruling motives for man's conduct. Thus he writes:\r\n\"Pleasure and pain are and always will be the only principles of action\r\nin man.\" [101]... \"Remorse is nothing more than a foresight of bodily\r\npain to which some crime has exposed us.\" [102] He definitely makes\r\nhappiness the end of human action. \"The end of man is self-preservation\r\nand the attainment of a happy existence.... Man, to find happiness,\r\nshould save up his pleasures, and refuse all those which might change\r\ninto pains.... The passions always have happiness as an object: they\r\nare legitimate and natural, and can not be called good or bad except\r\non account of their influence on human beings. To lead men to virtue,\r\nwe must show them the advantages of virtuous actions.\" [103] Holbach,\r\nfinally, goes further than La Mettrie or Helvetius, and makes purely\r\nmechanical impulses the motives of man's action. \"The passions are\r\nways of being or modifications of the internal organs, attracted or\r\nrepulsed by objects, and are consequently subject in their own way\r\nto the physical laws of attraction and repulsion.\" [104]\r\n\r\n39. \"Ixions of Christianity.\" Ixion, for his treachery, stricken\r\nwith madness, was cast into Erebus, where he was continually scourged\r\nwhile bound to a fiery wheel, and forced to cry: \"Benefactors should\r\nbe honored.\"\r\n\r\n40. \"Who can be sure that the reason for man's existence is not\r\nsimply the fact that he exists?\" Luzac opposes this by saying:\r\n\"If the reason of man's existence was in man himself, this existence\r\nwould be a necessary consequence of his own nature; so that his own\r\nnature would contain the cause or reason of his existence. Now since\r\nhis own nature would imply the cause of his existence, it would also\r\nimply his existence itself, so that man could no more be considered\r\nas non-existent than a circle can be considered without radii or a\r\npicture without features or proportions.... If the existence of man\r\nwas in man himself, he would then be an invariable being.\" [105]\r\n\r\n41. \"Fénelon (François de Salignac de la Mothe-Fénelon), born at\r\nChâteau de Fénelon, Dordogne, France, August 6, 1651, died at Cambrai,\r\nFrance, January 7, 1715.

Besides\r\nmaking studies of watch-making, and of fish, birds, and insects,\r\npublished in part in the Transactions of the Royal Society, he\r\nwrote several works on religious philosophy. The most important,\r\nwhich was popular for a long time and was translated into French\r\n(1726), has as title 'Physico-Theology, or the Demonstration of the\r\nExistence and the Attributes of God, by the Works of His Creation'\r\n(1713). He wrote as complement, in 1714, his 'Astro-Theology, or the\r\nDemonstration of the Existence and Attributes of God by the Observation\r\nof the Heavens.'\" [109]\r\n\r\n45. Rais, or Cardinal de Retz (1614-1679), was a French politician\r\nand author. From his childhood he was intended for the church. He\r\ntook an active part in the movement against Cardinal Mazarin, and\r\nlater became cardinal, but lost his popularity, and was imprisoned\r\nat Vincennes. After escaping from there he returned to France and\r\nsettled in Lorraine, where he wrote his 'Mémoires,' which tell of\r\nthe court life of his time. [110]\r\n\r\n46. Marcello Malpighi (1628-1694) was a renowned Italian anatomist\r\nand physiologist. He held the position of lecturer on medicine at\r\nBologna in 1656, a few months later became professor at Pisa, was made\r\nprofessor at Bologna in 1660, went from there to Messina, though he\r\nlater returned to Bologna. In 1691 he became physician to Pope Innocent\r\nXII. Malpighi is often known as the founder of microscopic anatomy. He\r\nwas the first to see the marvelous spectacle of the circulation of the\r\nblood on the surface of a frog's lung. He discovered the vesicular\r\nstructure of the human lung, the structure of the secreting glands,\r\nand the mucous character of the lower stratum of the epidermis. He\r\nwas the first to undertake the finer anatomy of the brain, and he\r\naccurately described the distribution of grey matter, and of the fibre\r\ntracts in the cord. His works are: \"De pulmonibus\" (Bologna, 1661),\r\n\"Epistolae anatomicae narc. Malpighi et Car. Fracassati\" (Amsterdam,\r\n1662), \"De Viscerum Structura\" (London, 1669), \"Anatome Plantarum\"\r\n(London, 1672), \"De Structura Glandularum conglobatarum\" (London,\r\n1689). [111]\r\n\r\n47. Deism is a system of thought which arose in the latter part\r\nof the seventeenth century. Its most important representatives in\r\nEngland were Toland, Collins, Chubb, Shaftsbury, and Tindal. They\r\ninsisted on freedom of thought and speech, and claimed that reason\r\nis superior to any authority. They denied the necessity of any\r\nsupernatural revelation, and were consequently vigorously opposed by\r\nthe church. Partly because of this opposition by the church, many of\r\nthem argued against Christianity, and tried to show that an observance\r\nof moral laws is the only religion necessary for man. They taught that\r\nhappiness is man's chief end, and that, since man is a social being,\r\nhis happiness can best be gained by mutual helpfulness. Although\r\nthey declared that nature is the work of a perfect being, they had\r\na mechanical conception of the relation of God to the world, and did\r\nnot, like later theists, find evidence of God's presence in all the\r\nworks of nature.

He studied at Rome and Padua, became a priest,\r\ntraveled in Germany and the Netherlands, and began teaching at Lyons,\r\nbut was obliged to flee to England, where he was arrested. After his\r\nrelease he returned to Lyons, and about 1617 settled at Toulouse. Here\r\nhe was arrested for his opinions, condemned, and on the same day\r\nexecuted. His chief works are: 'Amphitheatrum aeternae Providentiae'\r\n(1615), 'De admirandis naturae reginae deaeque mortalium arcanis'\r\n(1616).\" [113]\r\n\r\n49. Desbarreaux (Jacques Vallée). A French writer, born at Paris\r\nin 1602, who died at Chalon-sur-Saône the ninth of May, 1673. He\r\nwrote a celebrated sonnet on penitence, but was rather an unbeliever\r\nand sceptic than a penitent. Guy Patin, hearing of his death, said:\r\n\"He infected poor young people by his licence. His conversation was\r\nvery dangerous and destructive to the public.\" [114]\r\n\r\n50. Boindin (Nicolas), French scholar and author, born the twenty-ninth\r\nof May 1676 at Paris, where he died the thirtieth of November 1751. He\r\nwas in the army for a while, but retired on account of ill health. He\r\nthen gave himself up to literature, and wrote several plays. In\r\n1706 he was elected Royal censor and associate of the Academy of\r\nInscriptions. His liberty, or, as it was then called, license of mind,\r\nshut the doors of the French Academy to him, and would have caused\r\nhis expulsion from the Academy of Inscriptions if he had not been so\r\nold. He died without retracting his opinions. [115]\r\n\r\n51. Denis Diderot (1713-1784) was one of the leaders of the\r\nintellectual movement of the eighteenth century. He was at first\r\ninfluenced by Shaftsbury, and was enthusiastic in his support of\r\nnatural religion. In his \"Pensées philosophiques\" (1746) he tries to\r\nshow that the discoveries of natural science are the strongest proofs\r\nfor the existence of God. The wonders of animal life are enough to\r\ndestroy atheism for ever. Yet, while he opposes atheism, he also\r\nopposes vigorously the intolerance and bigotry of the church. He\r\nclaims that many of the attributes ascribed to God are contrary to\r\nthe very idea of a just and loving God.\r\n\r\nLater, Diderot was influenced by La Mettrie and by Holbach, and became\r\nan advocate of materialism which he set forth in \"Le rêve d'Alembert\"\r\nand in the passages contributed to the \"Système de la nature.\" Diderot\r\nwas the editor of the \"Encyclopédie.\" [116]\r\n\r\n52. Trembley. See note 27.\r\n\r\n53. \"Nothing which happens, could have failed to happen.\" An\r\nenunciation of the doctrine so insisted upon by Holbach. \"The whole\r\nuniverse ... shows us only an immense and uninterrupted chain of cause\r\nand effect.\" [117]... \"Necessity which regulates all the movements\r\nof the physical world, controls also those of the moral world.\" [118]\r\n\r\n54. \"All these evidences of a creator, repeated thousands ... of times\r\n... are self-evident only to the anti-Pyrrhonians.\" La Mettrie holds an\r\nopinion contrary not only to that of Descartes and Locke, but also to\r\nthat of Toland, Hobbes, and Condillac. Descartes, for instance, says:\r\n\"Thus I very clearly see that the certitude and truth of all science\r\ndepends on the knowledge alone of the true God.\" [119] Hobbes asserts:\r\n\"For he that from any effect he seeth come to pass should reason to\r\nthe next and immediate cause thereof, and from thence to the cause\r\nof that cause, ... shall at last come to this, that there must be,\r\nas even the heathen philosophers confessed, one first mover, that is\r\na first and an eternal cause of all things, which is that which men\r\nmean by the name of God.\" [120] Toland's words are: \"All the jumbling\r\nof atoms, all the Chances you can suppose for it, could not bring the\r\nParts of the Universe into their present Order, nor continue them in\r\nthe same, nor cause the Organization of a Flower or a Fly.... The\r\nInfinity of Matter ... excludes ... an extended corporeal God,\r\nbut not a pure Spirit or immaterial Being.\" [121] Condillac writes:\r\n\"A first cause, independent, unique, infinite, eternal, omnipotent,\r\nimmutable, intelligent, free, and whose providence extends over all\r\nthings: that is the most perfect notion of God that we can form in\r\nthis life.\" [122] Locke declares: \"From what has been said it is plain\r\nto me we have a more certain knowledge of the existence of a God than\r\nof anything our senses have not immediately discovered to us. Nay I\r\npresume I may say, that we more certainly know that there is a God,\r\nthan that there is anything else without us.\" [123]\r\n\r\n55. \"Lucretius (Titus Lucretius Carus). Born at Rome, probably about\r\n96 B.C., died October 15, 55 B.C. A celebrated Roman philosophical\r\npoet. He was the author of 'De rerum natura,' a didactic and\r\nphilosophical poem in six books, treating of physics, of psychology,\r\nand (briefly) of ethics from the Epicurean point of view. He committed\r\nsuicide probably in a fit of insanity. According to a popular but\r\ndoubtless erroneous tradition, his madness was due to a love-philter\r\nadministered to him by his wife.\" [124]\r\n\r\n56. \"Lamy (Bernard) was born in Mans in the year 1640. He studied\r\nfirst in the college of this city. He later went to Paris, and\r\nat Saumar studied philosophy under Charles de la Fontenelle,\r\nand theology under André Martin and Jean Leporc. He was at length\r\ncalled to teach philosophy in the city of Angers. He wrote a great\r\nmany books on theological subjects. His philosophical works are:\r\n'L'art de parler' (1675), 'Traité de méchanique, de l'équilibre, des\r\nsolides et des liqueurs' (1679), 'Traité de la grandeur en général'\r\n(1680), 'Entretiens sur les sciences' (1684), 'Eléments de géométrie,'\r\n(1685).\" [125]\r\n\r\n57. \"The eye sees only because it is formed and placed as it is.\" La\r\nMettrie doubts whether there is any purpose in the world. Condillac, on\r\nthe other hand, teaches that purpose and intelligence are shown forth\r\nin the universe. \"Can we see the order of the parts of the universe,\r\nthe subordination among them, and notice how so many different things\r\ncompose such a permanent whole, and remain convinced that the cause\r\nof the universe is a principle without any knowledge of its effects,\r\nwhich without purpose, without intelligence, relates each being to\r\nparticular ends, subordinated to a general end?\" [126]\r\n\r\n58. \"Non nostrum inter vos tantas componere lites.\" Vergil, Eclogue\r\nIII, line 108.\r\n\r\n59. \"The universe will never be happy unless it is atheistic.\" Although\r\nLa Mettrie calls this a \"strange opinion\" it is clear that he\r\nsecretly sympathizes with it. Holbach affirms this doctrine very\r\nemphatically. \"Experience teaches us that sacred opinions were the\r\nreal source of the evils of human beings. Ignorance of natural causes\r\ncreated gods for them. Imposture made these gods terrible. This idea\r\nhindered the progress of reason.\" [127] \"An atheist ... is a man who\r\ndestroys chimeras harmful to the human race, in order to lead men\r\nback to nature, to experience, and to reason, which has no need of\r\nrecourse to ideal powers, to explain the operations of nature.\" [128]\r\n\r\n60. \"The soul is therefore but an empty word.\" Contrast this with\r\nDescartes's statement: \"And certainly the idea I have of the human\r\nmind ... is incomparably more distinct than the idea of any corporeal\r\nobject.\" [129] Compare this doctrine, also, with Holbach's assertion:\r\n\"Those who have distinguished the soul from the body seem to have only\r\ndistinguished their brains from themselves. Truly the brain is the\r\ncommon center, where all the nerves spread in all parts of the human\r\nbody, terminate and join together.... The more experience we have,\r\nthe more we are convinced that the word 'spirit' has no meaning even\r\nto those who have invented it, and can be of no use either in the\r\nphysical or in the moral world.\" [130]\r\n\r\n61. William Cowper (1666-1709) was an English anatomist. He was\r\ndrawn into a controversy with Bidloo, the Dutch physician, by\r\npublishing under his own name Bidloo's work on the anatomy of human\r\nbodies. His principal works are: \"Myotamia reformata\" (London, 1694)\r\nand \"Glandularum descriptio\" (1702). [131]\r\n\r\n62. William Harvey (1578-1657), an English physician and physiologist,\r\nis renowned for his discovery of the circulation of the blood. He was\r\neducated at Canterbury and Cambridge, and took his doctor's degree at\r\nCambridge in 1602. During his life he held the position of Lumleian\r\nlecturer at the College of Physicians, and of physician extraordinary\r\nto James I. His principal works are: \"Exercitatio de motu cordis\r\net sanguinis\" (1628), and \"Exercitationes de generatione animalium\"\r\n(1651). [132]\r\n\r\n63. Francis Bacon (1551-1626) was one of the first to revolt\r\nagainst scholasticism and to introduce a new method into science\r\nand philosophy. He claimed that to know reality, and consequently\r\nto gain new power over reality, man must stop studying conceptions,\r\nand study matter itself. Yet he did not himself know how to gain\r\na more accurate knowledge of nature, so that he could not put into\r\npractice the method which he himself advocated. His works are full\r\nof scholastic conceptions, though many of the implications of his\r\nsystem are materialistic. Lange claims, [133] indeed, that if Bacon\r\nhad been more consistent and daring, he would have reached strictly\r\nmaterialistic conclusions. The account of the motion of the heart\r\nof the dead convict is found in \"Sylva Sylvarum.\" [134] This book,\r\npublished in 1627, a year after Bacon's death, contains the account\r\nof Bacon's experiments, and of his theories in matters of physiology,\r\nphysics, chemistry, medicine, and psychology.\r\n\r\n64. Robert Boyle, one of the greatest natural philosophers of his age,\r\nstudied at Eton for three years, and then became the private pupil of\r\nthe rector of Stalbridge. He traveled through France, Switzerland,\r\nand Italy, and while at Florence, studied the work of Galileo. He\r\ndecided to devote his life to scientific work, and in 1645 became\r\na member of a society of scientific men, which later grew into the\r\nRoyal Society of London. His principal work was the improvement of\r\nthe air-pump, and by that the discovery of the laws governing the\r\npressure and volume of gases.\r\n\r\nBoyle was also deeply interested in theology. He gave liberally for\r\nthe work of spreading Christianity in India and America, and by his\r\nwill endowed the \"Boyle Lectures\" to demonstrate the Christian religion\r\nagainst atheists, theists, pagans, Jews, and Mohammedans. [135]\r\n\r\n65. Nicolas Sténon was born at Copenhagen, 1631, and died at Schwerin\r\nin 1687. He studied at Leyden and Paris, and then settled in Florence,\r\nwhere he became the physician of the grand duke. In 1672 he became\r\nprofessor of anatomy at Florence, but three years later he gave up\r\nthis position and entered the church. In 1677 he was made Bishop\r\nof Heliopolis and went to Hanover, then to Munster, and finally\r\nto Schwerin. His principal work is the \"Discours sur l'anatomie du\r\ncerveau\" (Paris, 1669). [136]\r\n\r\n66. La Mettrie's account of involuntary movements is much like that of\r\nDescartes. Descartes says: \"If any one quickly passes his hand before\r\nour eyes as if to strike us, we shut our eyes, because the machinery\r\nof our body is so composed that the movement of this hand towards\r\nour eyes excites another movement in the brain, which controls the\r\nanimal spirits in the muscles that close the eyelids.\" [137]\r\n\r\n67. \"The brain has its muscles for thinking, as the legs have muscles\r\nfor walking.\" Neither Condillac nor Helvetius go so far. Helvetius\r\nexplicitly states that it is an open question whether sensation is\r\ndue to a material or to a spiritual substance. [138]\r\n\r\n68. Giovanni Alfonso Borelli (1608-1670) was the head of the so-called\r\niatro-mathematical sect. He tried to apply mathematics to medicine in\r\nthe same way in which it had been applied to the physical sciences. He\r\nwas wise enough to restrict the application of his system to the motion\r\nof the muscles, but his followers tried to extend its application and\r\nwere led into many absurd conjectures. Borelli was at first professor\r\nof mathematics at Pisa, and later professor of medicine at Florence. He\r\nwas connected with the revolt of Messina and was obliged to leave\r\nFlorence. He retired to Rome, where he was under the protection of\r\nChristina, Queen of Sweden, and remained there until his death in\r\n1679. [139]\r\n\r\n69. \"For one order that the will gives, it bows a hundred times to\r\nthe yoke.\" Descartes, on the other hand, teaches that the soul has\r\ndirect control over its voluntary actions and thoughts, and indirect\r\ncontrol over its passions. [140] La Mettrie goes further than to\r\nlimit the extent of the will, and questions whether it is ever free:\r\n\"The sensations which affect us decide the soul either to will or\r\nnot to will, to love or to hate these sensations according to the\r\npleasure or the pain which they cause in us. This state of the soul\r\nthus determined by its sensations is called the will.\" [141] Holbach\r\ninsists on this point and contends that all freedom is a delusion:\r\n\"[Man's] birth depends on causes entirely outside of his power; it\r\nis without his permission that he enters this system where he has\r\na place; and without his consent that, from the moment of his birth\r\nto the day of his death, he is continually modified by causes that\r\ninfluence his machine in spite of his will, modify his being, and\r\nalter his conduct. Is not the least reflexion enough to prove that\r\nthe solids and fluids of which the body is composed, and that the\r\nhidden mechanism that he considers independent of external causes,\r\nare perpetually under the influence of these causes, and could not act\r\nwithout them? Does he not see that his temperament does not depend\r\non himself, that his passions are the necessary consequences of his\r\ntemperament, that his will and his actions are determined by these same\r\npassions, and by ideas that he has not given to himself?... In a word,\r\neverything should convince man that during every moment of his life,\r\nhe is but a passive instrument in the hands of necessity.\" [142]\r\n\r\n70. The theory of animal spirits, held by Galen and elaborated by\r\nDescartes, is that the nerves are hollow tubes containing a volatile\r\nliquid, the animal spirits. The animal spirits were supposed to\r\ncirculate from the periphery to the brain and back again, and to\r\nperform by their action all the functions of the nerves.\r\n\r\n71. Berkeley uses the fact that the color of objects varies, as one\r\nargument for his idealistic conclusion. [143]\r\n\r\n72. It is hard to tell what Pythagoras himself taught, but it is\r\ncertain that he taught the kinship of animals and men, and upon\r\nthis kinship his rule for the abstinence from flesh was probably\r\nbased. Among the writings of the later Pythagoreans we find strange\r\nrules for diet which are plainly genuine taboos. For example they are\r\ncommanded \"to abstain from beans, not to break bread, not to eat from\r\na whole loaf, not to eat the heart, etc.\" [144]\r\n\r\n73. Plato forbade the use of wine in his ideal republic. [145]\r\n\r\n74. \"Nature's first care, when the chyle enters the blood, is to\r\nexcite in it a kind of fever.\" Thus, warmth is the first necessity\r\nfor the body. Compare with this, Descartes's statement: \"There is a\r\ncontinual warmth in our heart, ... this fire is the bodily principle\r\nof all the movements of our members.\" [146] This is one of the many\r\ninstances in which La Mettrie's account of the mechanism of the body\r\nis similar to that of Descartes.\r\n\r\n75. \"Stahl (George Ernst), born at Ansbach, Bavaria, October 21, 1660;\r\ndied at Berlin, May 14, 1734. A noted German chemist, physician of the\r\nKing of Prussia from 1716. His works include: 'Theoria medica vera'\r\n(1707), 'Experimenta et observationes chemicae' (1731), etc.\" [147]\r\n\r\n76. Philip Hecquet (1661-1737) was a celebrated French physician. He\r\nstudied at Rheims, and in 1688 became the physician of the nuns of Port\r\nRoyal des Champs. He returned to Paris in 1693 and took his doctor's\r\ndegree in 1697. He was twice dean of the faculty of Paris. In 1727\r\nhe became the physician of the religious Carmelites of the suburb of\r\nSaint Jacques, and remained their physician for thirty-two years. [148]\r\n\r\n77. The quotation: \"All men may not go to Corinth,\" is translated from\r\nHorace, Ep. 1, 19, 36. \"Non cuivis homini contigit adire Corinthum.\"\r\n\r\n78. Hermann Boerhaave was born at Voorhout near Leyden, on December 31,\r\n1668. His father, who belonged to the clerical profession, destined\r\nhis son for the same calling and so gave him a liberal education. At\r\nthe University of Leyden, he studied under Gronovius, Ryckius and\r\nFrigland. At the death of his father, Boerhaave was left without any\r\nprovision and supported himself by teaching mathematics. Vandenberg,\r\nthe burgomaster of Leyden, advised him to study medicine, and he\r\ndecided to devote himself to this profession. In 1693 he received his\r\ndegree and began to practice medicine. In 1701 he was made \"Lecturer\r\non the Institutes of Medicine\" at the University of Leyden. Thirteen\r\nyears later he was appointed Rector of the University, and the same\r\nyear became Professor of Practical Medicine there. He introduced into\r\nthe university the system of clinical instruction. Boerhaave's merit\r\nwas widely recognized, and his fame attracted many medical students\r\nfrom all Europe to the University of Leyden. Among these was La Mettrie\r\nwhose whole philosophy was profoundly influenced by the teaching of\r\nBoerhaave. In 1728 Boerhaave was elected into the Royal Academy of\r\nSciences of Paris, and two years later he was made a member of the\r\nRoyal Society of London. In 1731 his health compelled him to resign\r\nthe Rectorship at Leyden. At this time he delivered an oration, \"De\r\nHonore, Medici Servitute.\" He died after a long illness on April 23,\r\n1738. The city of Leyden erected a monument to him in the Church of\r\nSt. Peter, and inscribed on it: \"Salutifero Boerhaavii genio Sacrum.\"\r\n\r\nBoerhaave was a careful and brilliant student, an inspiring teacher,\r\nand a skilful practitioner. There are remarkable accounts of his skill\r\nin discovering symptoms, and in diagnosing diseases. His chief works\r\nare: \"Institutiones Medicae\" (Leyden, 1708); \"Aphorismi de cognoscendis\r\net curandis Morbis\" (Leyden, 1709), \"Libellus de Materia Medica et\r\nRemediorum Formulis\" (Leyden, 1719), \"Institutiones et Experimentae\r\nChemicae\" (Paris, 1724). [149]\r\n\r\n79. Willis. (See Note 21.)\r\n\r\n80. Claude Perrault (1613-1688) was a French physician and\r\narchitect. He received his degree of doctor of medicine at Paris\r\nand practised medicine there. In 1673 he became a member of the\r\nRoyal Academy of Sciences. Although he never abandoned his work in\r\nmathematics, in the natural sciences, and in medicine, he is more noted\r\nas an architect than as a physician or scientist. He was the architect\r\nof one of the colonnades of the Louvre, and of the Observatory. [150]\r\n\r\n81. \"Matter is self-moved.\" In \"L'histoire naturelle de l'âme\" La\r\nMettrie claims that motion is one of the essential properties of\r\nmatter. See \"L'histoire naturelle de l'âme,\" Chap. V.\r\n\r\n82. \"The nature of motion is as unknown to us as that of\r\nmatter.\" Unlike La Mettrie, Toland holds that it is possible to\r\nknow the nature of matter, and declares that motion and matter can\r\nnot be defined, because their nature is self-evident. [151] Holbach,\r\nresembling La Mettrie, teaches that it is futile to seek to know the\r\nultimate nature of matter, or the cause for its existence. \"Thus\r\nif any one shall ask whence matter came, we shall say that it has\r\nalways existed. If any one ask, whence came movement in matter, we\r\nshall answer that for this same reason matter must have moved from\r\neternity, since motion is a necessary consequence of its existence,\r\nits essence, and of its primitive properties, such as extent, weight,\r\nimpenetrability, shape, etc.... The existence of matter is a fact;\r\nthe existence of motion is another fact.\" [152]\r\n\r\n83. Huyghens (Christian) was born at The Hague, 1629, and died there\r\nin 1695. He was a Dutch physicist, mathematician, and astronomer. He is\r\ncelebrated for the invention of the pendulum clock which could measure\r\nthe movements of the planets, for the improvement of the telescope,\r\nand for the development of the wave-theory of light. His principal\r\nwork is \"Horologium Oscillatorium\" (1673). [153]\r\n\r\n84. Julien Leroy (1686-1759) was a celebrated French watchmaker. He\r\nexcelled in the construction of pendulums and of large clocks. Some\r\nhave attributed the construction of the first horizontal clock to him,\r\nbut this is doubtful. Among many other inventions and improvements\r\nof clocks, he invented the compensating pendulum which bears his\r\nname. [154]\r\n\r\n85. Jacques de Vaucanson (1709-1782) was a French mechanist. From his\r\nchildhood he was always interested in mechanical contrivances. In 1738\r\nhe presented to the French Academy his remarkable flute player. Soon\r\nafter, he made a duck which could swim, eat, and digest, and an asp\r\nwhich could hiss and dart on Cleopatra's breast. He later held the\r\nposition of inspector of the manufacture of silk. In 1748 he was\r\nadmitted to the Academy of Sciences. His machines were left to the\r\nQueen, but she gave them to the Academy, and in the disturbances which\r\nfollowed the pieces were scattered and lost. Vaucanson published:\r\n\"Mécanisme d'un flûteur automate\" (Paris, 1738). [155]\r\n\r\n86. \"[Descartes] understood animal nature; he was the first to prove\r\ncompletely that animals are pure machines.\" Contrast this with\r\nLa Mettrie's former reference in \"L'histoire naturelle de l'âme\"\r\nto \"this absurd system 'that animals are pure machines.' Such a\r\nlaughable opinion,\" he adds, \"has never gained admittance among\r\nphilosophers.... Experience does not prove the faculty of feeling any\r\nless in animals than in men.\" [156] It is evident that La Mettrie's\r\nopposition to this 'absurd system' was based upon his insistence on\r\nthe similarity of men and animals. In \"L'homme machine\" he argues\r\nfrom the same premiss, that animals are machines, that men are like\r\nanimals, and that therefore men also are machines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES ON THE EXTRACTS FROM \"L'HISTOIRE NATURELLE DE L'AME.\"\r\n\r\n87. Matter, according to La Mettrie, is endowed with extensity,\r\nthe power of movement, and the faculty of sensation. As La Mettrie\r\nsays, this conception was not held by Descartes, who thought that\r\nthe essential attribute of matter is extension. \"The nature of\r\nbody consists not in weight, hardness, color, and the like but\r\nin extension alone--in its being a substance extended in length,\r\nbreadth and height.\" [157] Hobbes's conception of matter is very\r\nsimilar to that of La Mettrie. He specifically attributes motion to\r\nmatter: \"Motion and magnitude are the most common accidents of all\r\nbodies.\" [158] He does not name sensation as an attribute of matter,\r\nbut he reduces sensation to motion. \"Sense is some internal motion in\r\nthe sentient.\" [159] Since motion is one of the attributes of matter,\r\nand since matter is the only reality in the universe, sensation must\r\nbe attributed to matter.\r\n\r\n88. La Mettrie always insists that matter has the power of moving\r\nitself, and resents any attempt to show that the motion is due to an\r\noutside agent. In this opinion he is in agreement with Toland. Toland\r\nsays that those who have regarded matter as inert have had to find\r\nsome efficient cause for motion; and to do this, they have held that\r\nall nature is animated. This pretended animation, however, is utterly\r\nuseless, since matter is itself endowed with motion.\r\n\r\n89. \"This absurd system ... that animals are pure machines.\" (See\r\nNote 86.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKS CONSULTED AND CITED IN THE NOTES.\r\n\r\n(An asterisk indicates the edition to which reference is made.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    JULIEN OFFRAY DE LA METTRIE.\r\n\r\n           1745       \"L'histoire naturelle de l'âme.\" The Hague.

Quel effrayant effet de l'imagination, ou d'une singulière\r\ncirculation dans un lobe du cerveau! Grand homme d'un côté, il était\r\nà moitié fou de l'autre.
