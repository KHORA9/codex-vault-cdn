Whatever shapes of death,\r\n  Shook from the hideous chambers of the globe,\r\n  Swarm thro’ the shuddering air: whatever plagues\r\n  Or meagre famine breeds, or with slow wings\r\n  Rise from the putrid watry element,                                 20\r\n  The damp waste forest, motionless and rank,\r\n  That smothers earth and all the breathless winds,\r\n  Or the vile carnage of th’ inhuman field;\r\n  Whatever baneful breathes the rotten south;\r\n  Whatever ills th’ extremes or sudden change                         25\r\n  Of cold and hot, or moist and dry produce;\r\n  They fly thy pure effulgence: they, and all\r\n  The secret poisons of avenging heaven,\r\n  And all the pale tribes halting in the train\r\n  Of vice and heedless pleasure: or if aught                          30\r\n  The comet’s glare amid the burning sky,\r\n  Mournful eclipse, or planets ill-combin’d,\r\n  Portend disastrous to the vital world;\r\n  Thy salutary power averts their rage,\r\n  Averts the general bane: and but for thee                           35\r\n  Nature would sicken, nature soon would die.\r\n\r\n    Without thy chearful active energy\r\n  No rapture swells the breast, no poet sings,\r\n  No more the maids of Helicon delight.\r\n  Come then with me, O Goddess heavenly-gay!                          40\r\n  Begin the song; and let it sweetly flow,\r\n  And let it wisely teach thy wholesom laws:\r\n  “How best the fickle fabric to support\r\n  “Of mortal man; in healthful body how\r\n  “A healthful mind the longest to maintain.”                         45\r\n  ’Tis hard, in such a strife of rules, to chuse\r\n  The best, and those of most extensive use;\r\n  Harder in clear and animated song\r\n  Dry philosophic precepts to convey.\r\n  Yet with thy aid the secret wilds I trace                           50\r\n  Of nature, and with daring steps proceed\r\n  Thro’ paths the muses never trod before.\r\n\r\n    Nor should I wander doubtful of my way,\r\n  Had I the lights of that sagacious mind\r\n  Which taught to check the pestilential fire,                        55\r\n  And quel the dreaded Python of the Nile.\r\n  O Thou belov’d by all the graceful arts,\r\n  Thou long the fav’rite of the healing powers,\r\n  Indulge, O MEAD! a well-design’d essay,\r\n  Howe’er imperfect: and permit that I                                60\r\n  My little knowledge with my country share,\r\n  Till you the rich Asclepian stores unlock,\r\n  And with new graces dignify the theme.\r\n\r\n    YE who amid this feverish world would wear\r\n  A body free of pain, of cares a mind;                               65\r\n  Fly the rank city, shun its turbid air;\r\n  Breathe not the chaos of eternal smoke\r\n  And volatile corruption, from the dead,\r\n  The dying, sickning, and the living world\r\n  Exhal’d, to sully heaven’s transparent dome                         70\r\n  With dim mortality. It is not air\r\n  That from a thousand lungs reeks back to thine,\r\n  Sated with exhalations rank and fell,\r\n  The spoil of dunghills, and the putrid thaw\r\n  Of nature; when from shape and texture she                          75\r\n  Relapses into fighting elements:\r\n  It is not air, but floats a nauseous mass\r\n  Of all obscene, corrupt, offensive things.\r\n  Much moisture hurts; but here a sordid bath,\r\n  With oily rancor fraught, relaxes more                              80\r\n  The solid frame than simple moisture can.\r\n  Besides, immur’d in many a sullen bay\r\n  That never felt the freshness of the breeze,\r\n  This slumbring deep remains, and ranker grows\r\n  With sickly rest: and (tho’ the lungs abhor                         85\r\n  To drink the dun fuliginous abyss)\r\n  Did not the acid vigour of the mine,\r\n  Roll’d from so many thundring chimneys, tame\r\n  The putrid salts that overswarm the sky;\r\n  This caustick venom would perhaps corrode                           90\r\n  Those tender cells that draw the vital air,\r\n  In vain with all their unctuous rills bedew’d;\r\n  Or by the drunken venous tubes, that yawn\r\n  In countless pores o’er all the pervious skin,\r\n  Imbib’d, would poison the balsamic blood,                           95\r\n  And rouse the heart to every fever’s rage.\r\n  While yet you breathe, away! the rural wilds\r\n  Invite; the mountains call you, and the vales,\r\n  The woods, the streams, and each ambrosial breeze\r\n  That fans the ever undulating sky;                                 100\r\n  A kindly sky! whose fost’ring power regales\r\n  Man, beast, and all the vegetable reign.\r\n  Find then some woodland scene where nature smiles\r\n  Benign, where all her honest children thrive.\r\n  To us there wants not many a happy seat;                           105\r\n  Look round the smiling land, such numbers rise\r\n  We hardly fix, bewilder’d in our choice.\r\n  See where enthron’d in adamantine state,\r\n  Proud of her bards, imperial Windsor sits;\r\n  There chuse thy seat, in some aspiring grove                       110\r\n  Fast by the slowly-winding Thames; or where\r\n  Broader she laves fair Richmond’s green retreats,\r\n  (Richmond that sees an hundred villas rise\r\n  Rural or gay.) O! from the summer’s rage\r\n  O! wrap me in the friendly gloom that hides                        115\r\n  Umbrageous Ham! But if the busy town\r\n  Attract thee still to toil for power or gold,\r\n  Sweetly thou mayst thy vacant hours possess\r\n  In Hampstead, courted by the western wind;\r\n  Or Greenwich, waving o’er the winding flood;                       120\r\n  Or lose the world amid the sylvan wilds\r\n  Of Dulwich, yet by barbarous arts unspoil’d.\r\n  Green rise the Kentish hills in chearful air;\r\n  But on the marshy plains that Essex spreads\r\n  Build not, nor rest too long thy wandering feet.                   125\r\n  For on a rustic throne of dewy turf,\r\n  With baneful fogs her aching temples bound,\r\n  Quartana there presides; a meagre fiend\r\n  Begot by Eurus, when his brutal force\r\n  Compress’d the slothful Naiad of the fens.                         130\r\n  From such a mixture sprung this fitful pest,\r\n  With feverish blasts subdues the sick’ning land:\r\n  Cold tremors come, and mighty love of rest,\r\n  Convulsive yawnings, lassitude, and pains\r\n  That sting the burden’d brows, fatigue the loins,                  135\r\n  And rack the joints, and every torpid limb;\r\n  Then parching heat succeeds, till copious sweats\r\n  O’erflow; a short relief from former ills.\r\n  Beneath repeated shocks the wretches pine;\r\n  The vigour sinks, the habit melts away;                            140\r\n  The chearful, pure and animated bloom\r\n  Dies from the face, with squalid atrophy\r\n  Devour’d, in sallow melancholy clad.\r\n  And oft the sorceress, in her sated wrath,\r\n  Resigns them to the furies of her train;                           145\r\n  The bloated Hydrops, and the yellow fiend\r\n  Ting’d with her own accumulated gall.\r\n\r\n    In quest of sites, avoid the mournful plain\r\n  Where osiers thrive, and trees that love the lake;\r\n  Where many lazy muddy rivers flow:                                 150\r\n  Nor for the wealth that all the Indies roll\r\n  Fix near the marshy margin of the main.\r\n  For from the humid soil, and watry reign,\r\n  Eternal vapours rise; the spungy air\r\n  For ever weeps; or, turgid with the weight                         155\r\n  Of waters, pours a sounding deluge down.\r\n  Skies such as these let every mortal shun\r\n  Who dreads the dropsy, palsy, or the gout,\r\n  Tertian, corrosive scurvy, or moist catarrh;\r\n  Or any other injury that grows                                     160\r\n  From raw-spun fibres idle and unstrung,\r\n  Skin ill-perspiring, and the purple flood\r\n  In languid eddies loitering into phlegm.\r\n\r\n      Yet not alone from humid skies we pine;\r\n  For air may be too dry. The subtle heaven,                         165\r\n  That winnows into dust the blasted downs,\r\n  Bare and extended wide without a stream,\r\n  Too fast imbibes th’ attenuated lymph\r\n  Which, by the surface, from the blood exhales.\r\n  The lungs grow rigid, and with toil essay                          170\r\n  Their flexible vibrations; or inflam’d,\r\n  Their tender ever-moving structure thaws.\r\n  Spoil’d of its limpid vehicle, the blood\r\n  A mass of lees remains, a drossy tide\r\n  That slow as Lethe wanders thro’ the veins,                        175\r\n  Unactive in the services of life,\r\n  Unfit to lead its pitchy current thro’\r\n  The secret mazy channels of the brain.\r\n  The melancholic fiend, (that worst despair\r\n  Of physic) hence the rust-complexion’d man                         180\r\n  Pursues, whose blood is dry, whose fibres gain\r\n  Too stretch’d a tone: And hence in climes adust\r\n  So sudden tumults seize the trembling nerves,\r\n  And burning fevers glow with double rage.\r\n\r\n      Fly, if you can, these violent extremes                        185\r\n  Of air; the wholesome is nor moist nor dry.\r\n  But as the power of chusing is deny’d\r\n  To half mankind, a further task ensues;\r\n  How best to mitigate these fell extreams,\r\n  How breathe unhurt the withering element,                          190\r\n  Or hazy atmosphere: Tho’ custom moulds\r\n  To every clime the soft Promethean clay;\r\n  And he who first the fogs of Essex breath’d\r\n  (So kind is native air) may in the fens\r\n  Of Essex from inveterate ills revive                               195\r\n  At pure Montpelier or Bermuda caught.\r\n  But if the raw and oozy heaven offend,\r\n  Correct the soil, and dry the sources up\r\n  Of watry exhalation; wide and deep\r\n  Conduct your trenches thro’ the spouting bog;                      200\r\n  Solicitous, with all your winding arts,\r\n  Betray th’ unwilling lake into the stream;\r\n  And weed the forest, and invoke the winds\r\n  To break the toils where strangled vapours lie;\r\n  Or thro’ the thickets send the crackling flames.                   205\r\n  Mean time, at home with chearful fires dispel\r\n  The humid air: And let your table smoke\r\n  With solid roast or bak’d; or what the herds\r\n  Of tamer breed supply; or what the wilds\r\n  Yield to the toilsom pleasures of the chase.                       210\r\n  Generous your wine, the boast of rip’ning years,\r\n  But frugal be your cups; the languid frame,\r\n  Vapid and sunk from yesterday’s debauch,\r\n  Shrinks from the cold embrace of watry heavens.\r\n  But neither these, nor all Apollo’s arts,                          215\r\n  Disarm the dangers of the dropping sky,\r\n  Unless with exercise and manly toil\r\n  You brace your nerves, and spur the lagging blood.\r\n  The fat’ning clime let all the sons of ease\r\n  Avoid; if indolence would wish to live.                            220\r\n  Go, yawn and loiter out the long slow year\r\n  In fairer skies. If droughty regions parch\r\n  The skin and lungs, and bake the thick’ning blood;\r\n  Deep in the waving forest chuse your seat,\r\n  Where fuming trees refresh the thirsty air;                        225\r\n  And wake the fountains from their secret beds,\r\n  And into lakes dilate the running stream.\r\n  Here spread your gardens wide; and let the cool,\r\n  The moist relaxing vegetable store\r\n  Prevail in each repast: Your food supplied                         230\r\n  By bleeding life, be gently wasted down,\r\n  By soft decoction and a mellowing heat,\r\n  To liquid balm; or, if the solid mass\r\n  You chuse, tormented in the boiling wave;\r\n  That thro’ the thirsty channels of the blood                       235\r\n  A smooth diluted chyle may ever flow.\r\n  The fragrant dairy from its cool recess\r\n  Its nectar acid or benign will pour\r\n  To drown your thirst; or let the mantling bowl\r\n  Of keen Sherbet the fickle taste relieve.                          240\r\n  For with the viscous blood the simple stream\r\n  Will hardly mingle; and fermented cups\r\n  Oft dissipate more moisture than they give.\r\n  Yet when pale seasons rise, or winter rolls\r\n  His horrors o’er the world, thou may’st indulge                    245\r\n  In feasts more genial, and impatient broach\r\n  The mellow cask. Then too the scourging air\r\n  Provokes to keener toils than sultry droughts\r\n  Allow. But rarely we such skies blaspheme.\r\n  Steep’d in continual rains, or with raw fogs                       250\r\n  Bedew’d, our seasons droop; incumbent still\r\n  A ponderous heaven o’erwhelms the sinking soul.\r\n  Lab’ring with storms in heapy mountains rise\r\n  Th’ imbattled clouds, as if the Stygian shades\r\n  Had left the dungeon of eternal night,                             255\r\n  Till black with thunder all the south descends.\r\n  Scarce in a showerless day the heavens indulge\r\n  Our melting clime; except the baleful east\r\n  Withers the tender spring, and sourly checks\r\n  The fancy of the year. Our fathers talk                            260\r\n  Of summers, balmy airs, and skies serene.\r\n  Good heaven! for what unexpiated crimes\r\n  This dismal change! The brooding elements\r\n  Do they, your powerful ministers of wrath,\r\n  Prepare some fierce exterminating plague?                          265\r\n  Or is it fix’d in the Decrees above\r\n  That lofty Albion melt into the main?\r\n  Indulgent nature! O dissolve this gloom!\r\n  Bind in eternal adamant the winds\r\n  That drown or wither: Give the genial west                         270\r\n  To breathe, and in its turn the sprightly north:\r\n  And may once more the circling seasons rule\r\n  The year; not mix in every monstrous day.\r\n\r\n      Mean time, the moist malignity to shun\r\n  Of burthen’d skies; mark where the dry champain                    275\r\n  Swells into chearful hills; where Marjoram\r\n  And Thyme, the love of bees, perfume the air;\r\n  And where the Cynorrhodon[2] with the rose\r\n  For fragrance vies; for in the thirsty soil\r\n  Most fragrant breathe the aromatic tribes.                         280\r\n  There bid thy roofs high on the basking steep\r\n  Ascend, there light thy hospitable fires.\r\n  And let them see the winter morn arise,\r\n  The summer evening blushing in the west;\r\n  While with umbrageous oaks the ridge behind                        285\r\n  O’erhung, defends you from the blust’ring north,\r\n  And bleak affliction of the peevish east.\r\n  O! when the growling winds contend, and all\r\n  The sounding forest fluctuates in the storm,\r\n  To sink in warm repose, and hear the din                           290\r\n  Howl o’er the steady battlements, delights\r\n  Above the luxury of vulgar sleep.\r\n  The murmuring rivulet, and the hoarser strain\r\n  Of waters rushing o’er the slippery rocks,\r\n  Will nightly lull you to ambrosial rest.                           295\r\n  To please the fancy is no trifling good,\r\n  Where health is studied; for whatever moves\r\n  The mind with calm delight, promotes the just\r\n  And natural movements of th’ harmonious frame.\r\n  Besides, the sportive brook for ever shakes                        300\r\n  The trembling air; that floats from hill to hill,\r\n  From vale to mountain, with incessant change\r\n  Of purest element, refreshing still\r\n  Your airy seat, and uninfected Gods.\r\n  Chiefly for this I praise the man who builds                       305\r\n  High on the breezy ridge, whose lofty sides\r\n  Th’ etherial deep with endless billows laves.\r\n  His purer mansion nor contagious years\r\n  Shall reach, nor deadly putrid airs annoy.\r\n\r\n      But may no fogs, from lake or fenny plain,                     310\r\n  Involve my hill. And wheresoe’er you build;\r\n  Whether on sun-burnt Epsom, or the plains\r\n  Wash’d by the silent Lee; in Chelsea low,\r\n  Or high Blackheath with wintry winds assail’d;\r\n  Dry be your house: but airy more than warm.                        315\r\n  Else every breath of ruder wind will strike\r\n  Your tender body thro’ with rapid pains;\r\n  Fierce coughs will teize you, hoarseness bind your voice,\r\n  Or moist Gravedo load your aching brows.\r\n  These to defy, and all the fates that dwell                        320\r\n  In cloister’d air tainted with steaming life,\r\n  Let lofty ceilings grace your ample rooms;\r\n  And still at azure noontide may your dome\r\n  At every window drink the liquid sky.\r\n\r\n      Need we the sunny situation here,                              325\r\n  And theatres open to the south, commend?\r\n  Here, where the morning’s misty breath infests\r\n  More than the torrid noon? How sickly grow,\r\n  How pale, the plants in those ill-fated vales\r\n  That, circled round with the gigantic heap                         330\r\n  Of mountains, never felt, nor never hope\r\n  To feel, the genial vigor of the sun!\r\n  While on the neighbouring hill the rose inflames\r\n  The verdant spring; in virgin beauty blows\r\n  The tender lily, languishingly sweet;                              335\r\n  O’er every hedge the wanton woodbine roves,\r\n  And autumn ripens in the summer’s ray.\r\n  Nor less the warmer living tribes demand\r\n  The fost’ring sun: whose energy divine\r\n  Dwells not in mortal fire; whose generous heat                     340\r\n  Glows thro’ the mass of grosser elements,\r\n  And kindles into life the pond’rous spheres.\r\n  Chear’d by thy kind invigorating warmth,\r\n  We court thy beams, great majesty of day!\r\n  If not the soul, the regent of this world,                         345\r\n  First born of heaven, and only less than God!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\nDIET.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Enough of air. A desart subject now,\r\n  Rougher and wilder, rises to my sight.\r\n  A barren waste, where not a garland grows\r\n  To bind the muse’s brow; not even a proud\r\n  Stupendous solitude frowns o’er the heath,                           5\r\n  To rouse a noble horror in the soul:\r\n  But rugged paths fatigue, and error leads\r\n  Thro’ endless labyrinths the devious feet.\r\n  Farewel, etherial fields! the humbler arts\r\n  Of life; the table and the homely Gods,                             10\r\n  Demand my song. Elysian gales adieu!\r\n\r\n    The blood, the fountain whence the spirits flow,\r\n  The generous stream that waters every part,\r\n  And motion, vigor, and warm life conveys\r\n  To every particle that moves or lives;                              15\r\n  This vital fluid, thro’ unnumber’d tubes\r\n  Pour’d by the heart, and to the heart again\r\n  Refunded; scourg’d for ever round and round,\r\n  Enrag’d with heat and toil, at last forgets\r\n  Its balmy nature; virulent and thin                                 20\r\n  It grows; and now, but that a thousand gates\r\n  Are open to its flight, it would destroy\r\n  The parts it cherish’d and repair’d before.\r\n  Besides, the flexible and tender tubes\r\n  Melt in the mildest, most nectareous tide                           25\r\n  That ripening nature rolls; as in the stream\r\n  Its crumbling banks; but what the vital force\r\n  Of plastic fluids hourly batters down,\r\n  That very force, those plastic particles\r\n  Rebuild: So mutable the state of man.                               30\r\n  For this the watchful appetite was giv’n,\r\n  Daily with fresh materials to repair\r\n  This unavoidable expence of life,\r\n  This necessary waste of flesh and blood.\r\n  Hence the concoctive powers, with various art,                      35\r\n  Subdue the cruder aliments to chyle;\r\n  The chyle to blood; the foamy purple tide\r\n  To liquors, which thro’ finer arteries\r\n  To different parts their winding course pursue;\r\n  To try new changes, and new forms put on,                           40\r\n  Or for the public, or some private use.\r\n\r\n    Nothing so foreign but th’ athletic hind\r\n  Can labour into blood. The hungry meal\r\n  Alone he fears, or aliments too thin,\r\n  By violent powers too easily subdu’d,                               45\r\n  Too soon expell’d. His daily labour thaws,\r\n  To friendly chyle, the most rebellious mass\r\n  That salt can harden, or the smoke of years;\r\n  Nor does his gorge the rancid bacon rue,\r\n  Nor that which Cestria sends, tenacious paste                       50\r\n  Of solid milk. But ye of softer clay\r\n  Infirm and delicate! and ye who waste\r\n  With pale and bloated sloth the tedious day!\r\n  Avoid the stubborn aliment, avoid\r\n  The full repast; and let sagacious age                              55\r\n  Grow wiser, lesson’d by the dropping teeth.\r\n\r\n      Half subtiliz’d to chyle, the liquid food\r\n  Readiest obeys th’ assimilating powers;\r\n  And soon the tender vegetable mass\r\n  Relents; and soon the young of those that tread                     60\r\n  The stedfast earth, or cleave the green abyss,\r\n  Or pathless sky. And if the Steer must fall,\r\n  In youth and vigor glorious let him die;\r\n  Nor stay till rigid age, or heavy ails,\r\n  Absolve him ill-requited from the yoke.                             65\r\n  Some with high forage, and luxuriant ease,\r\n  Indulge the veteran Ox; but wiser thou,\r\n  From the bleak mountain or the barren downs,\r\n  Expect the flocks by frugal nature fed;\r\n  A race of purer blood, with exercise                                70\r\n  Refin’d and scanty fare: For, old or young,\r\n  The stall’d are never healthy; nor the cramm’d.\r\n  Not all the culinary arts can tame,\r\n  To wholsome food, th’ abominable growth\r\n  Of rest and gluttony; the prudent taste                             75\r\n  Rejects like bane such loathsome lusciousness.\r\n  The languid stomach curses even the pure\r\n  Delicious fat, and all the race of oil;\r\n  For more the oily aliments relax\r\n  Its feeble tone; and with the eager lymph                           80\r\n  (Fond to incorporate with all it meets)\r\n  Coily they mix; and shun with slippery wiles\r\n  The wooed embrace. Th’ irresoluble oil,\r\n  So gentle late and blandishing, in floods\r\n  Of rancid bile o’erflows: What tumults hence,                       85\r\n  What horrors rise, were nauseous to relate.\r\n  Chuse leaner viands, ye of jovial make!\r\n  Chuse sober meals; and rouse to active life\r\n  Your cumbrous clay; nor on th’ enfeebling down,\r\n  Irresolute, protract the morning hours.                             90\r\n  But let the man, whose bones are thinly clad,\r\n  With chearful ease, and succulent repast\r\n  Improve his slender habit. Each extreme\r\n  From the blest mean of sanity departs.\r\n\r\n      I could relate what table this demands,                         95\r\n  Or that complexion; what the various powers\r\n  Of various foods: But fifty years would roll,\r\n  And fifty more, before the tale were done.\r\n  Besides, there often lurks some nameless, strange,\r\n  Peculiar thing; nor on the skin display’d,                         100\r\n  Felt in the pulse, nor in the habit seen;\r\n  Which finds a poison in the food that most\r\n  The temp’rature affects. There are, whose blood\r\n  Impetuous rages thro’ the turgid veins,\r\n  Who better bear the fiery fruits of Ind,                           105\r\n  Than the moist Melon, or pale Cucumber.\r\n  Of chilly nature others fly the board\r\n  Supply’d with slaughter, and the vernal pow’rs\r\n  For cooler, kinder, sustenance implore.\r\n  Some even the generous nutriment detest                            110\r\n  Which, in the shell, the sleeping Embryo rears.\r\n  Some, more unhappy still, repent the gifts\r\n  Of Pales; soft, delicious and benign:\r\n  The balmy quintescence of every flower,\r\n  And every grateful herb that decks the spring;                     115\r\n  The fost’ring dew of tender sprouting life;\r\n  The best reflection of declining age;\r\n  The kind restorative of those who lie\r\n  Half-dead and panting, from the doubtful strife\r\n  Of nature struggling in the grasp of death.                        120\r\n  Try all the bounties of this fertile globe,\r\n  There is not such a salutary food,\r\n  As suits with every stomach. But (except,\r\n  Amid the mingled mass of fish and fowl,\r\n  And boil’d and bak’d, you hesitate by which                        125\r\n  You sunk oppress’d, or whether not by all;)\r\n  Taught by experience soon you may discern\r\n  What pleases, what offends. Avoid the cates\r\n  That lull the sicken’d appetite too long;\r\n  Or heave with feverish flushings all the face,                     130\r\n  Burn in the palms, and parch the roughning tongue;\r\n  Or much diminish or too much increase\r\n  Th’ expence which nature’s wise oeconomy,\r\n  Without or waste or avarice, maintains.\r\n  Such cates abjur’d, let prouling hunger loose,                     135\r\n  And bid the curious palate roam at will;\r\n  They scarce can err amid the various stores\r\n  That burst the teeming entrails of the world.\r\n\r\n      Led by sagacious taste, the ruthless king\r\n  Of beasts on blood and slaughter only lives:                       140\r\n  The tyger, form’d alike to cruel meals,\r\n  Would at the manger starve: Of milder seeds,\r\n  The generous horse to herbage and to grain\r\n  Confines his wish; tho’ fabling Greece resound\r\n  The Thracian steeds with human carnage wild.                       145\r\n  Prompted by instinct’s never-erring power,\r\n  Each creature knows its proper aliment;\r\n  But man, th’ inhabitant of every clime,\r\n  With all the commoners of nature feeds.\r\n  Directed, bounded, by this pow’r within,                           150\r\n  Their cravings are well-aim’d: Voluptous man\r\n  Is by superior faculties misled;\r\n  Misled from pleasure even in quest of joy.\r\n  Sated with nature’s boons, what thousands seek,\r\n  With dishes tortur’d from their native taste,                      155\r\n  And mad variety, to spur beyond\r\n  Its wiser will the jaded appetite!\r\n  Is this for pleasure? Learn a juster taste;\r\n  And know, that temperance is true luxury.\r\n  Or is it pride? Pursue some nobler aim.                            160\r\n  Dismiss your parasites, who praise for hire;\r\n  And earn the fair esteem of honest men,\r\n  Whose praise is fame. Form’d of such clay as yours,\r\n  The sick, the needy, shiver at your gates.\r\n  Even modest want may bless your hand unseen,                       165\r\n  Tho’ hush’d in patient wretchedness at home.\r\n  Is there no virgin, grac’d with every charm\r\n  But that which binds the mercenary vow?\r\n  No youth of genius, whose neglected bloom\r\n  Unfoster’d sickens in the barren shade?                            170\r\n  No worthy man, by fortune’s random blows,\r\n  Or by a heart too generous and humane,\r\n  Constrain’d to leave his happy natal seat,\r\n  And sigh for wants more bitter than his own?\r\n  There are, while human miseries abound,                            175\r\n  A thousand ways to waste superfluous wealth,\r\n  Without one fool or flatterer at your board,\r\n  Without one hour of sickness or disgust.\r\n\r\n      But other ills th’ ambiguous feast pursue,\r\n  Besides provoking the lascivious taste.                            180\r\n  Such various foods, tho’ harmless each alone,\r\n  Each other violate; and oft we see\r\n  What strife is brew’d, and what pernicious bane,\r\n  From combinations of innoxious things.\r\n  Th’ unbounded taste I mean not to confine                          185\r\n  To hermit’s diet, needlessly severe.\r\n  But would you long the sweets of health enjoy,\r\n  Or husband pleasure; at one impious meal\r\n  Exhaust not half the bounties of the year,\r\n  And of each realm. It matters not mean while                       190\r\n  How much to morrow differ from to day;\r\n  So far indulge: ’tis fit, besides, that man,\r\n  To change obnoxious, be to change inur’d.\r\n  But stay the curious appetite, and taste\r\n  With caution fruits you never tried before.                        195\r\n  For want of use the kindest aliment\r\n  Sometimes offends; while custom tames the rage\r\n  Of poison to mild amity with life.\r\n\r\n      So heav’n has form’d us to the general taste\r\n  Of all its gifts; so custom has improv’d                           200\r\n  This bent of nature; that few simple foods,\r\n  Of all that earth, or air, or ocean yield,\r\n  But by excess offend. Beyond the sense\r\n  Of light refection, at the genial board\r\n  Indulge not often; nor protract the feast                          205\r\n  To dull satiety; till soft and slow\r\n  A drowzy death creeps on, th’ expansive soul\r\n  Oppress’d, and smother’d the celestial fire.\r\n  The stomach, urg’d beyond its active tone,\r\n  Hardly to nutrimental chyle subdues                                210\r\n  The softest food: unfinish’d and deprav’d,\r\n  The chyle, in all its future wand’rings, owns\r\n  Its turbid fountain; not by purer streams\r\n  So to be clear’d, but foulness will remain.\r\n  To sparkling wine what ferment can exalt                           215\r\n  Th’ unripen’d grape? Or what mechanic skill\r\n  From the crude ore can spin the ductile gold?\r\n  Gross riot treasures up a wealthy fund\r\n  Of plagues: but more immedicable ills\r\n  Attend the lean extreme. For physic knows                          220\r\n  How to disburden the too tumid veins,\r\n  Even how to ripen the half-labour’d blood;\r\n  But to unlock the elemental tubes,\r\n  Collaps’d and shrunk with long inanity,\r\n  And with balsamic nutriment repair                                 225\r\n  The dried and worn-out habit, were to bid\r\n  Old age grow green, and wear a second spring;\r\n  Or the tall ash, long ravish’d from the soil,\r\n  Thro’ wither’d veins imbibe the vernal dew.\r\n  When hunger calls, obey; nor often wait                            230\r\n  Till hunger sharpen to corrosive pain:\r\n  For the keen appetite will feast beyond\r\n  What nature well can bear; and one extreme\r\n  Ne’er without danger meets its own reverse.\r\n  Too greedily th’ exhausted veins absorb                            235\r\n  The recent chyle, and load enfeebled powers\r\n  Oft to th’ extinction of the vital flame.\r\n  To the pale cities, by the firm-set siege\r\n  And famine humbled, may this verse be borne;\r\n  And hear, ye hardiest sons that Albion breeds,                     240\r\n  Long toss’d and famish’d on the wintry main;\r\n  The war shook off, or hospitable shore\r\n  Attain’d, with temperance bear the shock of joy;\r\n  Nor crown with festive rites th’ auspicious day:\r\n  Such feast might prove more fatal than the waves,                  245\r\n  Than war, or famine. While the vital fire\r\n  Burns feebly, heap not the green fuel on;\r\n  But prudently foment the wandering spark\r\n  With what the soonest feels its kindred touch:\r\n  Be frugal ev’n of that: a little give                              250\r\n  At first; that kindled, add a little more;\r\n  Till, by deliberate nourishing, the flame\r\n  Reviv’d, with all its wonted vigor glows.\r\n\r\n      But tho’ the two (the full and the jejune)\r\n  Extremes have each their vice; it much avails                      255\r\n  Ever with gentle tide to ebb and flow\r\n  From this to that: So nature learns to bear\r\n  Whatever chance or headlong appetite\r\n  May bring. Besides, a meagre day subdues\r\n  The cruder clods by sloth or luxury                                260\r\n  Collected; and unloads the wheels of life.\r\n  Sometimes a coy aversion to the feast\r\n  Comes on, while yet no blacker omen lours;\r\n  Then is a time to shun the tempting board,\r\n  Were it your natal or your nuptial day.                            265\r\n  Perhaps a fast so seasonable starves\r\n  The latent seeds of woe, which rooted once\r\n  Might cost you labour. But the day return’d\r\n  Of festal luxury, the wise indulge\r\n  Most in the tender vegetable breed:                                270\r\n  Then chiefly when the summer’s beams inflame\r\n  The brazen heavens; or angry Syrius sheds\r\n  A feverish taint thro’ the still gulph of air.\r\n  The moist cool viands then, and flowing cup\r\n  From the fresh dairy-virgin’s liberal hand,                        275\r\n  Will save your head from harm, tho’ round the world\r\n  The dreaded Causos[3] roll his wasteful fires.\r\n  Pale humid Winter loves the generous board.\r\n  The meal more copious, and a warmer fare;\r\n  And longs, with old wood and old wine, to cheer                    280\r\n  His quaking heart. The seasons which divide\r\n  Th’ empires of heat and cold; by neither claim’d.\r\n  Influenc’d by both; a middle regimen\r\n  Impose. Thro’ autumn’s languishing domain\r\n  Descending, nature by degrees invites                              285\r\n  To glowing luxury. But from the depth\r\n  Of winter, when th’ invigorated year\r\n  Emerges; when Favonius flush’d with love,\r\n  Toyful and young, in every breeze descends\r\n  More warm and wanton on his kindling bride;                        290\r\n  Then, shepherds, then begin to spare your flocks;\r\n  And learn, with wise humanity, to check\r\n  The lust of blood. Now pregnant earth commits\r\n  A various offspring to th’ indulgent sky:\r\n  Now bounteous nature feeds with lavish hand                        295\r\n  The prone creation; yields what once suffic’d\r\n  Their dainty sovereign, when the world was young;\r\n  E’re yet the barbarous thirst of blood had seiz’d\r\n  The human breast. Each rolling month matures\r\n  The food that suits it most; so does each clime.                   300\r\n\r\n      Far in the horrid realms of winter, where\r\n  Th’ establish’d ocean heaps a monstrous waste\r\n  Of shining rocks and mountains to the pole;\r\n  There lives a hardy race, whose plainest wants\r\n  Relentless earth, their cruel step-mother,                         305\r\n  Regards not. On the waste of iron fields,\r\n  Untam’d, untractable, no harvests wave:\r\n  Pomona hates them, and the clownish God\r\n  Who tends the garden. In this frozen world\r\n  Such cooling gifts were vain: a fitter meal                        310\r\n  Is earn’d with ease; for here the fruitful spawn\r\n  Of Ocean swarms, and heaps their genial board\r\n  With generous fare and luxury profuse.\r\n  These are their bread, the only bread they know;\r\n  These, and their willing slave the deer, that crops                315\r\n  The shrubby herbage on their meager hills.\r\n  Girt by the burning zone, not thus the south\r\n  Her swarthy sons, in either Ind, maintains:\r\n  Or thirsty Lybia; from whose fervid loins\r\n  The lion bursts, and every fiend that roams                        320\r\n  Th’ affrighted wilderness. The mountain herd,\r\n  Adust and dry, no sweet repast affords;\r\n  Nor does the tepid main such kinds produce,\r\n  So perfect, so delicious, as the stores\r\n  Of icy Zembla. Rashly where the blood                              325\r\n  Brews feverish frays; where scarce the tubes sustain\r\n  Its tumid fervor and tempestuous course;\r\n  Kind nature tempts not to such gifts as these.\r\n  But here in livid ripeness melts the grape;\r\n  Here, finish’d by invigorating suns,                               330\r\n  Thro’ the green shade the golden Orange glows;\r\n  Spontaneous here the turgid Melon yields\r\n  A generous pulp; the Coco swells on high\r\n  With milky riches; and in horrid mail\r\n  The soft Ananas wraps its tender sweets.                           335\r\n  Earth’s vaunted progeny: In ruder air\r\n  Too coy to flourish, even to proud to live;\r\n  Or hardly rais’d by artificial fire\r\n  To vapid life. Here with a mother’s smile\r\n  Glad Amalthea pours her copious horn.                              340\r\n  Here buxom Ceres reigns: Th’ autumnal sea\r\n  In boundless billows fluctuates o’er their plains.\r\n  What suits the climate best, what suits the men,\r\n  Nature profuses most, and most the taste\r\n  Demands. The fountain, edg’d with racy wine                        345\r\n  Or acid fruit, bedews their thirsty souls.\r\n  The breeze eternal breathing round their limbs\r\n  Supports in else intolerable air:\r\n  While the cool Palm, the Plantain, and the grove\r\n  That waves on gloomy Lebanon, assuage                              350\r\n  The torrid hell that beams upon their heads.\r\n\r\n      Now come, ye Naiads, to the fountains lead;\r\n  Now let me wander thro’ your gelid reign.\r\n  I burn to view th’ enthusiastic wilds\r\n  By mortal else untrod. I hear the din                              355\r\n  Of waters thundering o’er the ruin’d cliffs.\r\n  With holy rev’rence I approach the rocks\r\n  Whence glide the streams renown’d in ancient song.\r\n  Here from the desart down the rumbling steep\r\n  First springs the Nile; here bursts the sounding Po                360\r\n  In angry waves; Euphrates hence devolves\r\n  A mighty flood to water half the East;\r\n  And there, in Gothic solitude reclin’d,\r\n  The chearless Tanais pours his hoary urn.\r\n  What solemn twilight! What stupendous shades                       365\r\n  Enwarp these infant floods! Thro’ every nerve\r\n  A sacred horror thrills, a pleasing fear\r\n  Glides o’er my frame. The forest deepens round;\r\n  And more gigantic still th’ impending trees\r\n  Stretch their extravagant arms athwart the gloom.                  370\r\n  Are these the confines of some fairy world?\r\n  A land of Genii? Say, beyond these wilds\r\n  What unknown nations? If indeed beyond\r\n  Aught habitable lies. And whither leads,\r\n  To what strange regions, or of bliss or pain,                      375\r\n  That subterraneous way? Propitious maids,\r\n  Conduct me, while with fearful steps I tread\r\n  This trembling ground. The task remains to sing\r\n  Your gifts, (so Pæon, so the powers of health\r\n  Command) to praise your chrystal element:                          380\r\n  The chief ingredient in heaven’s various works;\r\n  Whose flexile genius sparkles in the gem,\r\n  Grows firm in oak, and fugitive in wine;\r\n  The vehicle, the source, of nutriment\r\n  And life, to all that vegitate or live.                            385\r\n\r\n      O comfortable streams? With eager lips\r\n  And trembling hand the languid thirsty quaff\r\n  New life in you; fresh vigor fills their veins.\r\n  No warmer cups the rural ages knew;\r\n  None warmer sought the sires of human-kind.                        390\r\n  Happy in temperate peace! Their equal days\r\n  Felt not th’ alternate fits of feverish mirth,\r\n  And sick dejection. Still serene and pleas’d,\r\n  They knew no pains but what the tender soul\r\n  With pleasure yields to, and would ne’er forget.                   395\r\n  Blest with divine immunity from ails,\r\n  Long centuries they liv’d; their only fate\r\n  Was ripe old age, and rather sleep than death.\r\n  Oh! could those worthies from the world of Gods\r\n  Return to visit their degenerate sons,                             400\r\n  How would they scorn the joys of modern time,\r\n  With all our art and toil improv’d to pain!\r\n  Too happy they! But wealth brought luxury,\r\n  And luxury on sloth begot disease.\r\n\r\n      Learn temperance, friends; and hear without disdain            405\r\n  The choice of water. Thus the Coan[4] sage\r\n  Opin’d, and thus the learn’d of every school.\r\n  What least of foreign principles partakes\r\n  Is best: The lightest then; what bears the touch\r\n  Of fire the least, and soonest mounts in air;                      410\r\n  The most insipid; the most void of smell.\r\n  Such the rude mountain from his horrid sides\r\n  Pours down; such waters in the sandy vale\r\n  For ever boil, alike of winter frosts\r\n  And summer’s heat secure. The lucid stream,                        415\r\n  O’er rocks resounding, or for many a mile\r\n  Hurl’d down the pebbly channel, wholesome yields\r\n  And mellow draughts; except when winter thaws,\r\n  And half the mountains melt into the tide.\r\n  Tho’ thirst were ne’er so resolute, avoid                          420\r\n  The sordid lake, and all such drowsy floods\r\n  As fill from Lethe Belgia’s slow canals;\r\n  (With rest corrupt, with vegetation green;\r\n  Squalid with generation, and the birth\r\n  Of little monsters;) till the power of fire                        425\r\n  Has from profane embraces disengag’d\r\n  The violated lymph. The virgin stream\r\n  In boiling wastes its finer soul in air.\r\n\r\n      Nothing like simple element dilutes\r\n  The food, or gives the chyle so soon to flow.                      430\r\n  But where the stomach, indolently given,\r\n  Toys with its duty, animate with wine\r\n  Th’ insipid stream: Tho’ golden Ceres yields\r\n  A more voluptuous, a more sprightly draught;\r\n  Perhaps more active. Wine unmix’d, and all                         435\r\n  The gluey floods that from the vex’d abyss\r\n  Of fermentation spring; with spirit fraught,\r\n  And furious with intoxicating fire;\r\n  Retard concoction, and preserve unthaw’d\r\n  Th’ embodied mass. You see what countless years,                   450\r\n  Embalm’d in fiery quintescence of wine,\r\n  The puny wonders of the reptile world,\r\n  The tender rudiments of life, the slim\r\n  Unrav’lings of minute anatomy,\r\n  Maintain their texture, and unchang’d remain!                      455\r\n\r\n      We curse not wine: The vile excess we blame;\r\n  More fruitful, than th’ accumulated board,\r\n  Of pain and misery. For the subtle draught\r\n  Faster and surer swells the vital tide;\r\n  And with more active poison, than the floods                       460\r\n  Of grosser crudity convey, pervades\r\n  The far-remote meanders of our frame.\r\n  Ah! sly deceiver! Branded o’er and o’er,\r\n  Yet still believ’d! Exulting o’er the wreck\r\n  Of sober Vows! But the Parnassian maids                            465\r\n  Another time perhaps shall sing the joys,\r\n  The fatal charms, the many woes of wine;\r\n  Perhaps its various tribes, and various powers.\r\n\r\n    Meantime, I would not always dread the bowl,\r\n  Nor every trespass shun. The feverish strife,                      470\r\n  Rous’d by the rare debauch, subdues, expells\r\n  The loitering crudities, that burthen life;\r\n  And, like a torrent full and rapid, clears\r\n  Th’ obstructed tubes. Besides, this restless world\r\n  Is full of chances, which by habit’s power                         475\r\n  To learn to bear is easier than to shun.\r\n  Ah! when ambition, meagre love of gold,\r\n  Or sacred country calls, with mellowing wine\r\n  To moisten well the thirsty suffrages;\r\n  Say how, unseason’d to the midnight frays                          480\r\n  Of Comus and his rout, wilt thou contend\r\n  With Centaurs long to hardy deeds inur’d?\r\n  Then learn to revel; but by slow degrees:\r\n  By slow degrees the liberal arts are won;\r\n  And Hercules grew strong. But when you smooth                      485\r\n  The brows of care, indulge your festive vein\r\n  In cups by well-inform’d experience found\r\n  The least your bane; and only with your friends.\r\n  There are sweet follies, frailties to be seen\r\n  By friends alone, and men of generous minds.                       490\r\n\r\n      Oh! seldom may the fated hours return\r\n  Of drinking deep! I would not daily taste,\r\n  Except when life declines, even sober cups.\r\n  Weak withering age no rigid law forbids,\r\n  With frugal nectar, smooth and slow with balm,                     495\r\n  The sapless habit daily to bedew,\r\n  And give the hesitating wheels of life\r\n  Gliblier to play. But youth has better joys;\r\n  And is it wise when youth with pleasure flows,\r\n  To squander the reliefs of age and pain?                           500\r\n\r\n      What dext’rous thousands just within the goal\r\n  Of wild debauch direct their nightly course!\r\n  Perhaps no sickly qualms bedim their days,\r\n  No morning admonitions shock the head.\r\n  But ah! what woes remain! Life rolls apace,                        505\r\n  And that incurable disease old age,\r\n  In youthful bodies more severely felt,\r\n  More sternly active, shakes their blasted prime:\r\n  Except kind nature by some hasty blow\r\n  Prevent the lingering fates. For know, whate’er                    510\r\n  Beyond its natural fervor hurries on\r\n  The sanguine tide; whether the frequent bowl,\r\n  High-season’d fare, or exercise to toil\r\n  Protracted; spurs to its last stage tir’d life,\r\n  And sows the temples with untimely snow.\r\n  When life is new, the ductile fibres feel                          515\r\n  The heart’s increasing force; and, day by day,\r\n  The growth advances; till the larger tubes,\r\n  Acquiring (from their elemental[5] veins,\r\n  Condens’d to solid chords) a firmer tone,\r\n  Sustain, and just sustain, th’ impetuous blood.                    520\r\n  Here stops the growth. With overbearing pulse\r\n  And pressure, still the great destroy the small;\r\n  Still with the ruins of the small grow strong.\r\n  Life glows mean time, amid the grinding force\r\n  Of viscous fluids and elastic tubes;                               525\r\n  Its various functions vigorously are plied\r\n  By strong machinery; and in solid health\r\n  The man confirm’d long triumphs o’er disease.\r\n  But the full ocean ebbs: There is a point,\r\n  By nature fix’d, whence life must downwards tend.                  530\r\n  For still the beating tide consolidates\r\n  The stubborn vessels, more reluctant still,\r\n  To the weak throbbings of th’ enfeebled heart.\r\n  This languishing, these strengthning by degrees\r\n  To hard unyielding unelastic bone,                                 535\r\n  Thro’ tedious channels the congealing flood\r\n  Crawls lazily, and hardly wanders on;\r\n  It loiters still: And now it stirs no more.\r\n  This is the period few attain; the death\r\n  Of nature: Thus (so heav’n ordain’d it) life                       540\r\n  Destroys itself; and could these laws have chang’d,\r\n  Nestor might now the fates of Troy relate;\r\n  And Homer live immortal as his song.\r\n\r\n      What does not fade? The tower that long had stood\r\n  The crush of thunder, and the warring winds,                       545\r\n  Shook by the slow but sure destroyer Time,\r\n  Now hangs in doubtful ruins o’er its base.\r\n  And flinty pyramids, and walls of brass,\r\n  Descend; the Babylonian spires are sunk;\r\n  Achaia, Rome, and Egypt moulder down.                              550\r\n  Time shakes the liable tyranny of thrones,\r\n  And tottering empires rush by their own weight.\r\n  This huge rotundity we tread grows old;\r\n  And all those worlds that roll around the sun,\r\n  The sun himself, shall die; and ancient Night                      555\r\n  Again involve the desolate abyss:\r\n  Till the great FATHER thro’ the lifeless gloom\r\n  Extend his arm to light another world,\r\n  And bid new planets roll by other laws.\r\n  For thro’ the regions of unbounded space,                          560\r\n  Where unconfin’d omnipotence has room,\r\n  BEING, in various systems, fluctuates still\r\n  Between creation and abhorr’d decay;\r\n  It ever did; perhaps and ever will.\r\n  New worlds are still emerging from the deep;                       565\r\n  The old descending, in their turns to rise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\nEXERCISE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Thro’ various toils th’ adventurous muse has past;\r\n  But half the toil, and more than half, remains.\r\n  Rude is her theme, and hardly fit for song;\r\n  Plain, and of little ornament; and I\r\n  But little practis’d in th’ Aonian arts.                             5\r\n  Yet not in vain such labours have we tried,\r\n  If ought these lays the fickle health confirm.\r\n  To you, ye delicate, I write; for you\r\n  I tame my youth to philosophic cares,\r\n  And grow still paler by the midnight lamps.                         10\r\n  Not to debilitate with timorous rules\r\n  A hardy frame; nor needlessly to brave\r\n  Unglorious dangers, proud of mortal strength;\r\n  Is all the lesson that in wholsome years\r\n  Concerns the strong. His care were ill bestow’d                     15\r\n  Who would with warm effeminacy nurse\r\n  The thriving oak, which on the mountain’s brow\r\n  Bears all the blasts that sweep the wintry heav’n.\r\n\r\n      Behold the labourer of the glebe, who toils\r\n  In dust, in rain, in cold and sultry skies:                         20\r\n  Save but the grain from mildews and the flood,\r\n  Nought anxious he what sickly stars ascend.\r\n  He knows no laws by Esculapius given;\r\n  He studies none. Yet him nor midnight fogs\r\n  Infest, nor those envenom’d shafts that fly                         25\r\n  When rabid Sirius fires th’ autumnal noon.\r\n  His habit pure with plain and temperate meals,\r\n  Robust with labour, and by custom steel’d\r\n  To every casualty of varied life;\r\n  Serene he bears the peevish eastern blast,                          30\r\n  And uninfected breaths the mortal South.\r\n\r\n      Such the reward of rude and sober life;\r\n  Of labour such. By health the peasant’s toil\r\n  Is well repaid; if exercise were pain\r\n  Indeed, and temperance pain. By arts like these                     35\r\n  Laconia nurs’d of old her hardy sons;\r\n  And Rome’s unconquer’d legions urg’d their way,\r\n  Unhurt, thro’ every toil in every clime.\r\n\r\n      Toil, and be strong. By toil the flaccid nerves\r\n  Grow firm, and gain a more compacted tone;                          40\r\n  The greener juices are by toil subdu’d,\r\n  Mellow’d, and subtilis’d; the vapid old\r\n  Expell’d, and all the rancor of the blood.\r\n  Come, my companions, ye who feel the charms\r\n  Of nature and the year; come, let us stray                          45\r\n  Where chance or fancy leads our roving walk:\r\n  Come, while the soft voluptuous breezes fan\r\n  The fleecy heavens, enwrap the limbs in balm,\r\n  And shed a charming languor o’er the soul.\r\n  Nor when bright Winter sows with prickly frost                      50\r\n  The vigorous ether, in unmanly warmth\r\n  Indulge at home; nor even when Eurus’ blasts\r\n  This way and that convolve the lab’ring woods.\r\n  My liberal walks, save when the skies in rain\r\n  Or fogs relent, no season should confine                            55\r\n  Or to the cloister’d gallery or arcade.\r\n  Go, climb the mountain; from th’ etherial source\r\n  Imbibe the recent gale. The chearful morn\r\n  Beams o’er the hills; go, mount th’ exulting steed,\r\n  Already, see, the deep-mouth’d beagles catch                        60\r\n  The tainted mazes; and, on eager sport\r\n  Intent, with emulous impatience try\r\n  Each doubtful track. Or, if a nobler prey\r\n  Delight you more, go chase the desperate deer;\r\n  And thro’ its deepest solitudes awake                               65\r\n  The vocal forest with the jovial horn.\r\n\r\n      But if the breathless chase o’er hill and dale\r\n  Exceed your strength; a sport of less fatigue,\r\n  Not less delightful, the prolific stream\r\n  Affords. The chrystal rivulet, that o’er                            70\r\n  A stony channel rolls its rapid maze,\r\n  Swarms with the silver fry. Such, thro’ the bounds\r\n  Of pastoral Stafford, runs the brawling Trent;\r\n  Such Eden, sprung from Cumbrian mountains; such\r\n  The Esk, o’erhung with woods; and such the stream                   75\r\n  On whole Arcadian banks I first drew air,\r\n  Liddal; till now, except in Doric lays\r\n  Tun’d to her murmurs by her love-sick swains,\r\n  Unknown in song: Tho’ not a purer stream,\r\n  Thro’ meads more flow’ry, or more romantic groves,                  80\r\n  Rolls toward the western main. Hail sacred flood!\r\n  May still thy hospitable swains be blest\r\n  In rural innocence; thy mountains still\r\n  Teem with the fleecy race; thy tuneful woods\r\n  For ever flourish; and thy vales look gay                           85\r\n  With painted meadows, and the golden grain!\r\n  Oft, with thy blooming sons, when life was new,\r\n  Sportive and petulant, and charm’d with toys,\r\n  In thy transparent eddies have I lav’d:\r\n  Oft trac’d with patient steps thy fairy banks,                      90\r\n  With the well-imitated fly to hook\r\n  The eager trout, and with the slender line\r\n  And yielding rod sollicite to the shore\r\n  The struggling panting prey; while vernal clouds\r\n  And tepid gales obscur’d the ruffled pool,                          95\r\n  And from the deeps call’d forth the wanton swarms.\r\n\r\n      Form’d on the Samian school, or those of Ind,\r\n  There are who think these pastimes scarce humane.\r\n  Yet in my mind (and not relentless I)\r\n  His life is pure that wears no fouler stains.                      100\r\n  But if thro’ genuine tenderness of heart,\r\n  Or secret want of relish for the game,\r\n  You shun the glories of the chace, nor care\r\n  To haunt the peopled stream; the garden yields\r\n  A soft amusement, an humane delight.                               105\r\n  To raise th’ insipid nature of the ground;\r\n  Or tame its savage genius to the grace\r\n  Of careless sweet rusticity, that seems\r\n  The amiable result of happy chance,\r\n  Is to create; and gives a god-like joy,                            110\r\n  Which every year improves. Nor thou disdain\r\n  To check the lawless riot of the trees,\r\n  To plant the grove, or turn the barren mould.\r\n  O happy he! whom, when his years decline,\r\n  (His fortune and his fame by worthy means                          115\r\n  Attain’d, and equal to his moderate mind;\r\n  His life approv’d by all the wise and good,\r\n  Even envied by the vain) the peaceful groves\r\n  Of Epicurus, from this stormy world,\r\n  Receive to rest; of all ungrateful cares                           120\r\n  Absolv’d, and sacred from the selfish crowd.\r\n  Happiest of men! if the same soil invites\r\n  A chosen few, companions of his youth,\r\n  Once fellow-rakes perhaps, now rural friends;\r\n  With whom in easy commerce to pursue                               125\r\n  Nature’s free charms, and vie for sylvan fame:\r\n  A fair ambition; void of strife or guile,\r\n  Or jealousy, or pain to be outdone.\r\n  Who plans th’ enchanted garden, who directs\r\n  The visto best, and best conducts the stream;                      130\r\n  Whose groves the fastest thicken and ascend;\r\n  Whom first the welcome spring salutes; who shews\r\n  The earliest bloom, the sweetest proudest charms,\r\n  Of Flora; who best gives Pomona’s juice\r\n  To match the sprightly genius of Champain.                         135\r\n  Thrice happy days! in rural business past.\r\n  Blest winter nights! when, as the genial fire\r\n  Chears the wide hall, his cordial family\r\n  With soft domestic arts the hours beguile,\r\n  And pleasing talk that starts no timerous fame,                    140\r\n  With witless wantoness to hunt it down:\r\n  Or thro’ the fairy-land of tale or song\r\n  Delighted wander, in fictitious fates\r\n  Engag’d, and all that strikes humanity;\r\n  Till lost in fable, they the stealing hour                         145\r\n  Of timely rest forget. Sometimes, at eve,\r\n  His neighbours lift the latch, and bless unbid\r\n  His festal roof; while, o’er the light repast,\r\n  And sprightly cups, they mix in social joy;\r\n  And, thro’ the maze of conversation, trace                         150\r\n  Whate’er amuses or improves the mind.\r\n  Sometimes at eve (for I delight to taste\r\n  The native zest and flavour of the fruit,\r\n  Where sense grows wild, and takes of no manure)\r\n  The decent, honest, chearful husbandman                            155\r\n  Should drown his labours in my friendly bowl;\r\n  And at my table find himself at home.\r\n\r\n      Whate’er you study, in whate’er you sweat,\r\n  Indulge your taste. Some love the manly foils;\r\n  The tennis some; and some the graceful dance.                      160\r\n  Others, more hardy, range the purple heath,\r\n  Or naked stubble; where from field to field\r\n  The sounding coveys urge their labouring flight;\r\n  Eager amid the rising cloud to pour\r\n  The gun’s unerring thunder: And there are                          165\r\n  Whom still the meed[6] of the green archer charms.\r\n  He chuses best, whose labour entertains\r\n  His vacant fancy most: The toil you hate\r\n  Fatigues you soon, and scarce improves your limbs.\r\n\r\n      As beauty still has blemish; and the mind                      170\r\n  The most accomplish’d its imperfect side;\r\n  Few bodies are there of that happy mould\r\n  But some one part is weaker than the rest:\r\n  The legs, perhaps, or arms refuse their load,\r\n  Or the chest labours. These assiduously,                           175\r\n  But gently, in their proper arts employ’d,\r\n  Acquire a vigor and elastic spring\r\n  To which they were not born. But weaker parts\r\n  Abhor fatigue and violent discipline.\r\n\r\n      Begin with gentle toils; and, as your nerves                   180\r\n  Grow firm, to hardier by just steps aspire.\r\n  The prudent, even in every moderate walk,\r\n  At first but saunter; and by slow degrees\r\n  Increase their pace. This doctrine of the wise\r\n  Well knows the master of the flying steed.                         185\r\n  First from the goal the manag’d coursers play\r\n  On bended reins; as yet the skilful youth\r\n  Repress their foamy pride; but every breath\r\n  The race grows warmer, and the tempest swells;\r\n  Till all the fiery mettle has its way,                             190\r\n  And the thick thunder hurries o’er the plain.\r\n  When all at once from indolence to toil\r\n  You spring, the fibres by the hasty shock\r\n  Are tir’d and crack’d, before their unctuous coats,\r\n  Compress’d, can pour the lubricating balm.                         195\r\n  Besides, collected in the passive veins,\r\n  The purple mass a sudden torrent rolls,\r\n  O’erpowers the heart, and deluges the lungs\r\n  With dangerous inundation: Oft the source\r\n  Of fatal woes; a cough that foams with blood,                      200\r\n  Asthma, and feller Peripneumonie[7],\r\n  Or the slow minings of the hectic fire.\r\n\r\n      Th’ athletic fool, to whom what heav’n deny’d\r\n  Of soul is well compensated in limbs,\r\n  Oft from his rage, or brainless frolic, feels                      205\r\n  His vegetation and brute force decay.\r\n  The men of better clay and finer mould\r\n  Know nature, feel the human dignity;\r\n  And scorn to vie with oxen or with apes.\r\n  Pursued prolixly, even the gentlest toil                           210\r\n  Is waste of health: Repose by small fatigue\r\n  Is earn’d; and (where your habit is not prone\r\n  To thaw) by the first moisture of the brows.\r\n  The fine and subtle spirits cost too much\r\n  To be profus’d, too much the roscid balm.                          215\r\n  But when the hard varieties of life\r\n  You toil to learn; or try the dusty chace,\r\n  Or the warm deeds of some important day:\r\n  Hot from the field, indulge not yet your limbs\r\n  In wish’d repose, nor court the fanning gale,                      220\r\n  Nor taste the spring. O! by the sacred tears\r\n  Of widows, orphans, mothers, sisters, sires,\r\n  Forbear! No other pestilence has driven\r\n  Such myriads o’er th’ irremeable deep.\r\n  Why this so fatal, the sagacious muse                              225\r\n  Thro’ nature’s cunning labyrinths could trace:\r\n  But there are secrets which who knows not now,\r\n  Must, ere he reach them, climb the heapy Alps\r\n  Of science; and devote seven years to toil.\r\n  Besides, I would not stun your patient ears                        230\r\n  With what it little boots you to attain.\r\n  He knows enough, the mariner, who knows\r\n  Where lurk the shelves, and where the whirlpools boil,\r\n  What signs portend the storm: To subtler minds\r\n  He leaves to scan, from what mysterious cause                      235\r\n  Charybdis rages in th’ Ionian wave;\r\n  Whence those impetuous currents in the main,\r\n  Which neither oar nor sail can stem; and why\r\n  The roughning deep expects the storm, as sure\r\n  As red Orion mounts the shrowded heaven.                           240\r\n\r\n    In ancient times, when Rome with Athens vied\r\n  For polish’d luxury and useful arts;\r\n  All hot and reeking from th’ Olympic strife,\r\n  And warm Palestra, in the tepid bath\r\n  Th’ athletic youth relax’d their weary’d limbs.                    245\r\n  Soft oils bedew’d them, with the grateful pow’rs\r\n  Of Nard and Cassia fraught, to sooth and heal\r\n  The cherish’d nerves. Our less voluptuous clime\r\n  Not much invites us to such arts as these.\r\n  ’Tis not for those, whom gelid skies embrace,                      250\r\n  And chilling fogs; whose perspiration feels\r\n  Such frequent bars from Eurus and the North;\r\n  ’Tis not for those to cultivate a skin\r\n  Too soft; or teach the recremental fume\r\n  Too fast to crowd thro’ such precarious ways.                      255\r\n  For thro’ the small arterial mouths, that pierce\r\n  In endless millions the close-woven skin,\r\n  The baser fluids in a constant stream\r\n  Escape, and viewless melt into the winds.\r\n  While this eternal, this most copious waste                        260\r\n  Of blood degenerate into vapid brine,\r\n  Maintains its wonted measure; all the powers\r\n  Of health befriend you, all the wheels of life\r\n  With ease and pleasure move: But this restrain’d\r\n  Or more or less, so more or less you feel                          265\r\n  The functions labour. From this fatal source\r\n  What woes descend is never to be sung.\r\n  To take their numbers, were to count the sands\r\n  That ride in whirlwind the parch’d Lybian air;\r\n  Or waves that, when the blustering North embroils                  270\r\n  The Baltic, thunder on the German shore.\r\n  Subject not then, by soft emollient arts,\r\n  This grand expence, on which your fates depend,\r\n  To every caprice of the sky; nor thwart\r\n  The genius of your clime: For from the blood                       275\r\n  Least fickle rise the recremental steams,\r\n  And least obnoxious to the styptic air,\r\n  Which breathe thro’ straiter and more callous pores.\r\n  The temper’d Scythian hence, half-naked treads\r\n  His boundless snows, nor rues th’ inclement heaven;                280\r\n  And hence our painted ancestors defied\r\n  The East; nor curs’d, like us, their fickle sky.\r\n\r\n      The body moulded by the clime, indures\r\n  Th’ Equator heats, or Hyperborean frost:\r\n  Except by habits foreign to its turn,                              285\r\n  Unwise, you counteract its forming pow’r.\r\n  Rude at the first, the winter shocks you less\r\n  By long acquaintance: Study then your sky,\r\n  Form to its manners your obsequious frame,\r\n  And learn to suffer what you cannot shun.                          290\r\n  Against the rigors of a damp cold heav’n\r\n  To fortify their bodies, some frequent\r\n  The gelid cistern; and, where nought forbids,\r\n  I praise their dauntless heart. A frame so steel’d\r\n  Dreads not the cough, nor those ungenial blasts,                   295\r\n  That breathe the Tertian or fell Rheumatism;\r\n  The nerves so temper’d never quit their tone,\r\n  No chronic languors haunt such hardy breasts.\r\n  But all things have their bounds: And he who makes\r\n  By daily use the kindest regimen                                   300\r\n  Essential to his health, should never mix\r\n  With human kind, nor art nor trade pursue.\r\n  He not the safe vicissitudes of life\r\n  Without some shock endures; ill-fitted he\r\n  To want the known, or bear unusual things.                         305\r\n  Besides, the powerful remedies of pain\r\n  (Since pain in spite of all our care will come)\r\n  Should never with your prosperous days of health\r\n  Grow too familiar: For by frequent use\r\n  The strongest medicines lose their healing power,                  310\r\n  And even the surest poisons theirs to kill.\r\n\r\n      Let those who from the frozen Arctos reach\r\n  Parch’d Mauritania, or the sultry West,\r\n  Or the wide flood that waters Indostan,\r\n  Plunge thrice a day, and in the tepid wave                         315\r\n  Untwist their stubborn pores; that full and free\r\n  Th’ evaporation thro’ the softned skin\r\n  May bear proportion to the swelling blood.\r\n  So shall they ’scape the fever’s rapid flames;\r\n  So feel untainted the hot breath of hell.                          320\r\n  With us, the man of no complaint demands\r\n  The warm ablution, just enough to clear\r\n  The sluices of the skin, enough to keep\r\n  The body sacred from indecent soil.\r\n  Still to be pure, even did it not conduce                          325\r\n  (As much it does) to health, were greatly worth\r\n  Your daily pains. ’Tis this adorns the rich;\r\n  The want of this is poverty’s worst woe:\r\n  With this external virtue, age maintains\r\n  A decent grace; without it, youth and charms                       330\r\n  Are loathsome. This the skilful virgin knows:\r\n  So doubtless do your wives. For married sires,\r\n  As well as lovers, still pretend to taste;\r\n  Nor is it less (all prudent wives can tell)\r\n  To lose a husband’s, than a lover’s heart.                         335\r\n\r\n      But now the hours and seasons when to toil,\r\n  From foreign themes recall my wandering song.\r\n  Some labour fasting, or but slightly fed,\r\n  To lull the grinding stomach’s hungry rage:\r\n  Where nature feeds too corpulent a frame                           340\r\n  ’Tis wisely done. For while the thirsty veins,\r\n  Impatient of lean penury, devour\r\n  The treasur’d oil, then is the happiest time\r\n  To shake the lazy balsam from its cells.\r\n  Now while the stomach from the full repast                         345\r\n  Subsides; but ere returning hunger gnaws;\r\n  Ye leaner habits give an hour to toil:\r\n  And ye whom no luxuriancy of growth\r\n  Oppresses yet, or threatens to oppress.\r\n  But from the recent meal no labours please,                        350\r\n  Of limbs or mind. For now the cordial powers\r\n  Claim all the wandering spirits to a work\r\n  Of strong and subtle toil, and great event;\r\n  A work of time: and you may rue the day\r\n  You hurried, with ill-seasoned exercise,                           355\r\n  A half concocted chyle into the blood.\r\n  The body overcharg’d with unctuous phlegm\r\n  Much toil demands: The lean elastic less.\r\n  While winter chills the blood, and binds the veins,\r\n  No labours are too hard: By those you ’scape                       360\r\n  The slow diseases of the torpid year;\r\n  Endless to name; to one of which alone,\r\n  To that which tears the nerves, the toil of slaves\r\n  Is pleasure: Oh! from such inhuman pains\r\n  May all be free who merit not the wheel!                           365\r\n  But from the burning Lion when the sun\r\n  Pours down his sultry wrath; now while the blood\r\n  Too much already maddens in the veins,\r\n  And all the finer fluids thro’ the skin\r\n  Explore their flight; me, near the cool cascade                    370\r\n  Reclin’d, or sauntring in the lofty grove,\r\n  No needless slight occasion should engage\r\n  To pant and sweat beneath the fiery noon.\r\n  Now the fresh morn alone and mellow eve\r\n  To shady walks and active rural sports                             375\r\n  Invite. But, while the chilling dews descend,\r\n  May nothing tempt you to the cold embrace\r\n  Of humid skies: Tho’ ’tis no vulgar joy\r\n  To trace the horrors of the solemn wood,\r\n  While the soft evening saddens into night:                         380\r\n  Tho’ the sweet poet of the vernal groves\r\n  Melts all the night in strains of amorous woe.\r\n\r\n      The shades descend, and midnight o’er the world\r\n  Expands her sable wings. Great nature droops\r\n  Thro’ all her works. Now happy he whose toil                       385\r\n  Has o’er his languid powerless limbs diffus’d\r\n  A pleasing lassitude: He not in vain\r\n  Invokes the gentle deity of dreams.\r\n  His powers the most voluptuously dissolve\r\n  In soft repose: On him the balmy dews                              390\r\n  Of sleep with double nutriment descend.\r\n  But would you sweetly waste the blank of night\r\n  In deep oblivion; or on fancy’s wings\r\n  Visit the paradise of happy dreams,\r\n  And waken chearful as the lively morn;                             395\r\n  Oppress not nature sinking down to rest\r\n  With feasts too late, too solid, or too full.\r\n  But be the first concoction half-matur’d,\r\n  Ere you to mighty indolence resign\r\n  Your passive faculties. He from the toils                          400\r\n  And troubles of the day to heavier toil\r\n  Retires, whom trembling from the tower that rocks\r\n  Amid the clouds, or Calpe’s hideous height,\r\n  The busy dæmons hurl, or in the main\r\n  O’erwhelm, or bury struggling under ground.                        405\r\n  Not all a monarch’s luxury the woes\r\n  Can counterpoise, of that most wretched man,\r\n  Whose nights are shaken with the frantic fits\r\n  Of wild Orestes; whose delirious brain,\r\n  Stung by the furies, works with poisoned thought!                  410\r\n  While pale and monstrous painting shocks the soul;\r\n  And mangled consciousness bemoans itself\r\n  For ever torn; and chaos floating round.\r\n  What dreams presage, what dangers these or those\r\n  Portend to sanity, tho’ prudent seers                              415\r\n  Reveal’d of old, and men of deathless fame;\r\n  We would not to the superstitious mind\r\n  Suggest new throbs, new vanities of fear.\r\n  ’Tis ours to teach you from the peaceful night\r\n  To banish omens, and all restless woes.                            420\r\n\r\n      In study some protract the silent hours,\r\n  Which others consecrate to mirth and wine;\r\n  And sleep till noon, and hardly live till night.\r\n  But surely this redeems not from the shades\r\n  One hour of life. Nor does it nought avail                         425\r\n  What season you to drowsy Morpheus give\r\n  Of th’ ever-varying circle of the day;\r\n  Or whether, thro’ the tedious winter gloom,\r\n  You tempt the midnight or the morning damps.\r\n  The body, fresh and vigorous from repose,                          430\r\n  Defies the early fogs: but, by the toils\r\n  Of wakeful day, exhausted and unstrung,\r\n  Weakly resists the night’s unwholsome breath.\r\n  The grand discharge, th’ effusion of the skin,\r\n  Slowly impair’d, the languid maladies                              435\r\n  Creep on, and thro’ the sickning functions steal.\r\n  So, when the chilling East invades the spring,\r\n  The delicate Narcissus pines away\r\n  In hectic languor; and a slow disease\r\n  Taints all the family of flowers, condemn’d                        440\r\n  To cruel heav’ns. But why, already prone\r\n  To fade, should beauty cherish its own bane?\r\n  O shame! O pity! nipt with pale Quadrille,\r\n  And midnight cares, the bloom of Albion dies!\r\n\r\n      By toil subdu’d, the Warrior and the Hind                      445\r\n  Sleep fast and deep; their active functions soon\r\n  With generous streams the subtle tubes supply,\r\n  And soon the tonick irritable nerves\r\n  Feel the fresh impulse, and awake the soul.\r\n  The sons of indolence, with long repose,                           450\r\n  Grow torpid; and, with slowest Lethe drunk,\r\n  Feebly and lingringly return to life,\r\n  Blunt every sense and powerless every limb.\r\n  Ye, prone to sleep (whom sleeping most annoys)\r\n  On the hard mattrass or elastic couch                              455\r\n  Extend your limbs, and wean yourselves from sloth;\r\n  Nor grudge the lean projector, of dry brain\r\n  And springy nerves, the blandishments of down.\r\n  Nor envy while the buried bacchanal\r\n  Exhales his surfeit in prolixer dreams.                            460\r\n\r\n    He without riot, in the balmy feast\r\n  Of life, the wants of nature has supplied\r\n  Who rises cool, serene, and full of soul.\r\n  But pliant nature more or less demands,\r\n  As custom forms her; and all sudden change                         465\r\n  She hates of habit, even from bad to good.\r\n  If faults in life, or new emergencies,\r\n  From habits urge you by long time confirm’d,\r\n  Slow may the change arrive, and stage by stage;\r\n  Slow as the shadow o’er the dial moves,                            470\r\n  Slow as the stealing progress of the year.\r\n\r\n    Observe the circling year. How unperceiv’d\r\n  Her seasons change! Behold! by slow degrees,\r\n  Stern Winter tam’d into a ruder spring;\r\n  The ripen’d Spring a milder summer glows;                          475\r\n  Departing Summer sheds Pomona’s store;\r\n  And aged Autumn brews the winter-storm.\r\n  Slow as they come, these changes come not void\r\n  Of mortal shocks: The cold and torrid reigns,\r\n  The two great periods of th’ important year,                       480\r\n  Are in their first approaches seldom safe:\r\n  Funereal autumn all the sickly dread,\r\n  And the black fates deform the lovely spring.\r\n  He well advis’d, who taught our wiser sires\r\n  Early to borrow Muscovy’s warm spoils,                             485\r\n  Ere the first frost has touch’d the tender blade;\r\n  And late resign them, tho’ the wanton spring\r\n  Should deck her charms with all her sister’s rays.\r\n  For while the effluence of the skin maintains\r\n  Its native measure, the pleuritic Spring                           490\r\n  Glides harmless by; and Autumn, sick to death\r\n  With sallow Quartans, no contagion breathes.\r\n\r\n      I in prophetic numbers could unfold\r\n  The omens of the year: what seasons teem\r\n  With what diseases; what the humid South                           495\r\n  Prepares, and what the Dæmon of the East:\r\n  But you perhaps refuse the tedious song.\r\n  Besides, whatever plagues in heat, or cold,\r\n  Or drought, or moisture dwell, they hurt not you,\r\n  Skill’d to correct the vices of the sky,                           500\r\n  And taught already how to each extream\r\n  To bend your life. But should the public bane\r\n  Infect you, or some trespass of your own,\r\n  Or flaw of nature hint mortality:\r\n  Soon as a not unpleasing horror glides                             505\r\n  Along the spine, thro’ all your torpid limbs;\r\n  When first: the head throbs, or the stomach feels\r\n  A sickly load, a weary pain the loins;\r\n  Be Celsus call’d: The fates come rushing on;\r\n  The rapid fates admit of no delay.                                 510\r\n  While wilful you, and fatally secure,\r\n  Expect to morrow’s more auspicious sun,\r\n  The growing pest, whose infancy was weak\r\n  And easy vanquish’d, with triumphant sway\r\n  O’erpow’rs your life. For want of timely care                      515\r\n  Millions have died of medicable wounds.\r\n\r\n    Ah! in what perils is vain life engag’d!\r\n  What slight neglects, what trivial faults destroy\r\n  The hardiest frame! Of indolence, of toil,\r\n  We die; of want, of superfluity.                                   520\r\n  The all-surrounding heaven, the vital air,\r\n  Is big with death. And, tho’ the putrid South\r\n  Be shut; tho’ no convulsive agony\r\n  Shake, from the deep foundations of the world,\r\n  Th’ imprisoned plagues; a secret venom oft                         525\r\n  Corrupts the air, the water, and the land.\r\n  What livid deaths has sad Byzantium seen!\r\n  How oft has Cairo, with a mother’s woe,\r\n  Wept o’er her slaughter’d sons, and lonely streets!\r\n  Even Albion, girt with less malignant skies,                       530\r\n  Albion the poison of the Gods has drunk,\r\n  And felt the sting of monsters all her own.\r\n\r\n      Ere yet the fell Plantagenets had spent\r\n  Their ancient rage, at Bosworth’s purple field;\r\n  While, for which tyrant England should receive,                    535\r\n  Her legions in incestuous murders mix’d,\r\n  And daily horrors; till the Fates were drunk\r\n  With kindred blood by kindred hands profus’d:\r\n  Another plague of more gygantic arm\r\n  Arose, a monster never known before                                540\r\n  Rear’d from Cocytus its portentuous head.\r\n  This rapid fury not, like other pests,\r\n  Pursued a gradual course, but in a day\r\n  Rush’d as a storm o’er half th’ astonish’d isle,\r\n  And strew’d with sudden carcasses the land.                        545\r\n\r\n    First thro’ the shoulders, or whatever part\r\n  Was seiz’d the first, a fervid vapour sprung.\r\n  With rash combustion thence, the quivering spark\r\n  Shot to the heart, and kindled all within;\r\n  And soon the surface caught the spreading fires.                   550\r\n  Thro’ all the yielding pores the melted blood\r\n  Gush’d out in smoaky sweats; but nought assuag’d\r\n  The torrid heat within, nor aught reliev’d\r\n  The stomach’s anguish. With incessant toil,\r\n  Desperate of ease, impatient of their pain,                        555\r\n  They toss’d from side to side. In vain the stream\r\n  Ran full and clear, they burnt and thirsted still.\r\n  The restless arteries with rapid blood\r\n  Beat strong and frequent. Thick and pantingly\r\n  The breath was fetch’d, and with huge lab’rings heav’d.            560\r\n  At last a heavy pain oppress’d the head,\r\n  A wild delirium came; their weeping friends\r\n  Were strangers now, and this no home of theirs.\r\n  Harass’d with toil on toil, the sinking powers\r\n  Lay prostrate and o’erthrown; a ponderous sleep                    565\r\n  Wrapt all the senses up: They slept and died.\r\n\r\n      In some a gentle horror crept at first\r\n  O’er all the limbs; the sluices of the skin\r\n  Withheld their moisture, till by art provok’d\r\n  The sweats o’erflow’d; but in a clammy tide:                       570\r\n  Now free and copious, now restrain’d and slow;\r\n  Of tinctures various, as the temperature\r\n  Had mix’d the blood; and rank with fetid steams:\r\n  As if the pent-up humors by delay\r\n  Were grown more fell, more putrid, and malign.                     575\r\n  Here lay their hopes (tho’ little hope remain’d)\r\n  With full effusion of perpetual sweats\r\n  To drive the venom out. And here the fates\r\n  Were kind, that long they linger’d not in pain.\r\n  For who surviv’d the sun’s diurnal race                            580\r\n  Rose from the dreary gates of hell redeem’d:\r\n  Some the sixth hour oppress’d, and some the third.\r\n\r\n      Of many thousands few untainted ’scap’d;\r\n  Of those infected fewer ’scap’d alive:\r\n  Of those who liv’d some felt a second blow;                        585\r\n  And whom the second spar’d a third destroy’d.\r\n  Frantic with fear, they sought by flight to shun\r\n  The fierce contagion. O’er the mournful land\r\n  Th’ infected city pour’d her hurrying swarms:\r\n  Rous’d by the flames that fir’d her seats around,                  590\r\n  Th’ infected country rush’d into the town.\r\n  Some, sad at home, and in the desart some,\r\n  Abjur’d the fatal commerce of mankind;\r\n  In vain: where’er they fled the Fates pursued.\r\n  Others, with hopes more specious, cross’d the main,                595\r\n  To seek protection in far-distant skies;\r\n  But none they found. It seem’d the general air\r\n  Was then at enmity with English blood.\r\n  For, but the race of England, all were safe\r\n  In foreign climes; nor did this fury taste                         600\r\n  The foreign blood which Albion then contain’d.\r\n  Where should they fly? The circumambient heaven\r\n  Involv’d them still; and every breeze was bane.\r\n  Where find relief? The salutary art\r\n  Was mute; and, startled at the new disease,                        605\r\n  In fearful whispers hopeless omens gave.\r\n  To heaven with suppliant rites they sent their pray’rs;\r\n  Heav’n heard them not. Of every hope depriv’d;\r\n  Fatigu’d with vain resources; and subdued\r\n  With woes resistless and enfeebling fear;                          610\r\n  Passive they sunk beneath the weighty blow.\r\n  Nothing but lamentable sounds was heard,\r\n  Nor ought was seen but ghastly views of death;\r\n  Infectious horror ran from face to face,\r\n  And pale despair. ’Twas all the business then                      615\r\n  To tend the sick, and in their turns to die.\r\n  In heaps they fell: And oft one bed, they say,\r\n  The sickening, dying, and the dead contain’d.\r\n\r\n      Ye guardian Gods, on whom the Fates depend\r\n  Of tottering Albion! Ye eternal fires,                             620\r\n  That lead thro’ heav’n the wandering year! Ye powers,\r\n  That o’er th’ incircling elements preside!\r\n  May nothing worse than what this age has seen\r\n  Arrive! Enough abroad, enough at home\r\n  Has Albion bled. Here a distemper’d heaven                         625\r\n  Has thin’d her cities; from those lofty cliffs\r\n  That awe proud Gaul, to Thule’s wintry reign;\r\n  While in the West, beyond th’ Atlantic foam,\r\n  Her bravest sons, keen for the fight, have died\r\n  The death of cowards, and of common men;                           630\r\n  Sunk void of wounds, and fall’n without renown.\r\n\r\n    But from these views the weeping Muses turn,\r\n  And other themes invite my wandering song.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.\r\n\r\nThe PASSIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The choice of aliment, the choice of air,\r\n  The use of toil and all external things,\r\n  Already sung; it now remains to trace\r\n  What good what evil from ourselves proceeds:\r\n  And how the subtle principle within                                  5\r\n  Inspires with health, or mines with strange decay\r\n  The passive body. Ye poetic Shades,\r\n  That know the secrets of the world unseen,\r\n  Assist my song! For, in a doubtful theme\r\n  Engag’d, I wander thro’ mysterious ways.                            10\r\n\r\n    There is, they say, (and I believe there is)\r\n  A spark within us of th’ immortal fire,\r\n  That animates and moulds the grosser frame;\r\n  And when the body sinks, escapes to heaven,\r\n  Its native seat; and mixes with the Gods.                           15\r\n  Mean while this heavenly particle pervades\r\n  The mortal elements, in every nerve\r\n  It thrills with pleasure, or grows mad with pain.\r\n  And, in its secret conclave, as it feels\r\n  The body’s woes and joys, this ruling power                         20\r\n  Weilds at its will the dull material world,\r\n  And is the body’s health or malady.\r\n\r\n      By its own toil the gross corporeal frame\r\n  Fatigues, extenuates, or destroys itself:\r\n  Nor less the labours of the mind corrode                            25\r\n  The solid fabric. For by subtle parts,\r\n  And viewless atoms, secret Nature moves\r\n  The mighty wheels of this stupendous world.\r\n  By subtle fluids pour’d thro’ subtle tubes\r\n  The natural, vital, functions are perform’d.                        30\r\n  By these the stubborn aliments are tam’d;\r\n  The toiling heart distributes life and strength;\r\n  These the still-crumbling frame rebuild; and these\r\n  Are lost in thinking, and dissolve in air.\r\n\r\n    But ’tis not Thought (for still the soul’s employ’d)              35\r\n  ’Tis painful thinking that corrodes our clay.\r\n  All day the vacant eye without fatigue\r\n  Strays o’er the heaven and earth; but long intent\r\n  On microscopic arts its vigour fails.\r\n  Just so the mind, with various thought amus’d,                      40\r\n  Nor aches itself, nor gives the body pain.\r\n  But anxious Study, Discontent, and Care,\r\n  Love without hope, and Hate without revenge,\r\n  And Fear, and Jealousy, fatigue the soul,\r\n  Engross the subtle ministers of life,                               45\r\n  And spoil the lab’ring functions of their share.\r\n  Hence the lean gloom that Melancholy wears;\r\n  The Lover’s paleness; and the sallow hue\r\n  Of Envy, Jealousy; the meagre stare\r\n  Of sore Revenge: The canker’d body hence                            50\r\n  Betrays each fretful motion of the mind.\r\n\r\n    The strong-built pedant; who both night and day\r\n  Feeds on the coarsest fare the schools bestow,\r\n  And crudely fattens at gross Burman’s stall;\r\n  O’erwhelm’d with phlegm lies in a dropsy drown’d,                   55\r\n  Or sinks in lethargy before his time.\r\n  With useful studies you, and arts that please\r\n  Employ your mind, amuse but not fatigue.\r\n  Peace to each drowsy metaphysic sage!\r\n  And ever may the German folio’s rest!                               60\r\n  Yet some there are, even of elastic parts,\r\n  Whom strong and obstinate ambition leads\r\n  Thro’ all the rugged roads of barren lore,\r\n  And gives to relish what their generous taste\r\n  Would else refuse. But may nor thirst of fame                       65\r\n  Nor love of knowledge urge you to fatigue\r\n  With constant drudgery the liberal soul.\r\n  Toy with your books: and, as the various fits\r\n  Of humour seize you, from Philosophy\r\n  To Fable shift; from serious Antonine                               70\r\n  To Rabelais’ ravings, and from prose to song.\r\n\r\n    While reading pleases, but no longer, read;\r\n  And read aloud resounding Homer’s strain,\r\n  And weild the thunder of Demosthenes.\r\n  The chest so exercis’d improves its strength;                       75\r\n  And quick vibrations thro’ the bowels drive\r\n  The restless blood, which in unactive days\r\n  Would loiter else thro’ unelastic tubes.\r\n  Deem it not trifling while I recommend\r\n  What posture suits: To stand and sit by turns,                      80\r\n  As nature prompts, is best. But o’er your leaves\r\n  To lean for ever, cramps the vital parts,\r\n  And robs the fine machinery of its play.\r\n\r\n      ’Tis the great art of life to manage well\r\n  The restless mind. For ever on pursuit                              85\r\n  Of knowledge bent it starves the grosser powers.\r\n  Quite unemploy’d, against its own repose\r\n  Its turns its fatal edge, and sharper pangs\r\n  Than what the body knows embitter life.\r\n  Chiefly where Solitude, sad nurse of care,                          90\r\n  To sickly musing gives the pensive mind.\r\n  There madness enters; and the dim-ey’d Fiend,\r\n  Sour Melancholy, night and day provokes\r\n  Her own eternal wound. The sun grows pale;\r\n  A mournful visionary light o’erspreads                              95\r\n  The chearful face of nature: earth becomes\r\n  A dreary desart, and heaven frowns above.\r\n  Then various shapes of curs’d illusion rise;\r\n  Whate’er the wretched fears, creating Fear\r\n  Forms out of nothing; and with monsters teems                      100\r\n  Unknown in hell. The prostrate soul beneath\r\n  A load of huge imagination heaves.\r\n  And all the horrors, that the guilty feel,\r\n  With anxious flutterings wake the guiltless breast.\r\n\r\n      Such phantoms Pride in solitary scenes,                        105\r\n  Or Fear, on delicate Self-love creates.\r\n  From other cares absolv’d, the busy mind\r\n  Finds in yourself a theme to pore upon;\r\n  It finds you miserable, or makes you so.\r\n  For while yourself you anxiously explore,                          110\r\n  Timorous Self-love, with sick’ning Fancy’s aid,\r\n  Presents the danger that you dread the most,\r\n  And ever galls you in your tender part.\r\n  Hence some for love, and some for jealousy,\r\n  For grim religion some, and some for pride,                        115\r\n  Have lost their reason: some for fear of want\r\n  Want all their lives; and others every day\r\n  For fear of dying suffer worse than death.\r\n  Ah! from your bosoms banish, if you can,\r\n  Those fatal guests: and first the Demon Fear;                      120\r\n  That trembles at impossible events,\r\n  Lest aged Atlas should resign his load\r\n  And heaven’s eternal battlements rush down.\r\n  Is there an evil worse than fear itself?\r\n  And what avails it that indulgent heaven                           125\r\n  From mortal eyes has wrapt the woes to come,\r\n  If we, ingenious to torment ourselves,\r\n  Grow pale at hideous fictions of our own?\r\n  Enjoy the present; nor with needless cares,\r\n  Of what may spring from blind Misfortune’s womb,                   130\r\n  Appal the surest hour that life bestows.\r\n  Serene, and master of yourself, prepare\r\n  For what may come; and leave the rest to heaven.\r\n\r\n      Oft from the body, by long ails mistun’d,\r\n  These evils sprung the most important health,                      135\r\n  That of the mind, destroy: And when the mind\r\n  They first invade, the conscious body soon\r\n  In sympathetic languishment declines.\r\n  These chronic passions, while from real woes\r\n  They rise, and yet without the body’s fault                        140\r\n  Infest the soul, admit one only cure;\r\n  Diversion, hurry, and a restless life.\r\n  Vain are the consolations of the wise,\r\n  In vain your friends would reason down your pain.\r\n  Oh ye whose souls relentless love has tam’d                        145\r\n  To soft distress, or friends untimely slain!\r\n  Court not the luxury of tender thought:\r\n  Nor deem it impious to forget those pains\r\n  That hurt the living, nought avail the dead.\r\n  Go, soft enthusiast! quit the cypress groves,                      150\r\n  Nor to the rivulet’s lonely moanings tune\r\n  Your sad complaint. Go, seek the chearful haunts\r\n  Of men, and mingle with the bustling croud;\r\n  Lay schemes for wealth, or power, or fame, the wish\r\n  Of nobler minds, and push them night and day.                      155\r\n  Or join the caravan in quest of scenes\r\n  New to your eyes, and shifting every hour;\r\n  Beyond the Alps, beyond the Apennines.\r\n  Or, more advent’rous, rush into the field\r\n  Where war grows hot; and, raging thro’ the sky,                    160\r\n  The lofty trumpet swells the maddening soul:\r\n  And in the hardy camp and toilsome march\r\n  Forget all softer and less manly cares.\r\n\r\n      But most too passive, when the blood runs low,\r\n  Too weakly indolent to strive with pain,                           165\r\n  And bravely by resisting conquer Fate,\r\n  Try Circe’s arts; and in the tempting bowl\r\n  Of poison’d Nectar sweet oblivion drink.\r\n  Struck by the powerful charm, the gloom dissolves\r\n  In empty air; Elysium opens round.                                 170\r\n  A pleasing phrenzy buoys the lighten’d soul,\r\n  And sanguine hopes dispel your fleeting care;\r\n  And what was difficult, and what was dire,\r\n  Yields to your prowess and superior stars:\r\n  The happiest you, of all that e’er were mad,                       175\r\n  Or are, or shall be, could this folly last.\r\n  But soon your heaven is gone; a heavier gloom\r\n  Shuts o’er your head: and, as the thundering stream,\r\n  Swoln o’er its banks with sudden mountain rain,\r\n  Sinks from its tumult to a silent brook;                           180\r\n  So, when the frantic raptures in your breast\r\n  Subside, you languish into mortal man;\r\n  You sleep, and waking find yourself undone.\r\n  For prodigal of life in one rash night\r\n  You lavish’d more than might support three days.                   185\r\n  A heavy morning comes; your cares return\r\n  With tenfold rage. An anxious stomach well\r\n  May be endur’d; so may the throbbing head:\r\n  But such a dim delirium, such a dream,\r\n  Involves you; such a dastardly despair                             190\r\n  Unmans your soul, as madd’ning Pentheus felt\r\n  When, baited round Citheron’s cruel sides,\r\n  He saw two suns, and double Thebes ascend.\r\n  You curse the sluggish Port; you curse the wretch,\r\n  The felon, with unnatural mixture first                            195\r\n  Who dar’d to violate the virgin Wine.\r\n  Or on the fugitive Champain you pour\r\n  A thousand curses; for to heav’n your soul\r\n  It rapt, to plunge you deeper in despair.\r\n  Perhaps you rue even that divinest gift,                           200\r\n  The gay, serene, good-natur’d Burgundy,\r\n  Or the fresh fragrant vintage of the Rhine:\r\n  And with that heaven from mortals had withheld\r\n  The grape, and all intoxicating bowls.\r\n\r\n    Besides, it wounds you sore to recollect                         205\r\n  What follies in your loose unguarded hour\r\n  Escap’d. By one irrevocable word,\r\n  Perhaps that meant no harm, you lose a friend.\r\n  Or in the rage of wine your hasty hand\r\n  Performs a deed to haunt you to your grave.                        210\r\n  Add that your means, your health, your parts decay;\r\n  Your friends avoid you; brutishly transform’d\r\n  They hardly know you; or if one remains\r\n  To wish you well, he wishes you in heaven.\r\n  Despis’d, unwept you fall; who might have left                     215\r\n  A sacred, cherish’d, sadly-pleasing name;\r\n  A name still to be utter’d with a sigh.\r\n  Your last ungraceful scene has quite effac’d\r\n  All sense and memory of your former worth.\r\n\r\n    How to live happiest; how avoid the pains,                       220\r\n  The disappointments, and disgusts of those\r\n  Who would in pleasure all their hours employ;\r\n  The precepts here of a divine old man\r\n  I could recite. Tho’ old, he still retain’d\r\n  His manly sense, and energy of mind.                               225\r\n  Virtuous and wise he was, but not severe;\r\n  He still remember’d that he once was young;\r\n  His easy presence check’d no decent joy.\r\n  Him even the dissolute admir’d; for he\r\n  A graceful looseness when he pleas’d put on,                       230\r\n  And laughing cou’d instruct. Much had he read,\r\n  Much more had seen; he studied from the life,\r\n  And in th’ original perus’d mankind.\r\n\r\n      Vers’d in the woes and vanities of life,\r\n  He pitied man: And much he pitied those                            235\r\n  Whom falsely-smiling fate has curs’d with means\r\n  To dissipate their days in quest of joy.\r\n  Our aim is Happiness; ’tis yours, ’tis mine,\r\n  He said, ’tis the pursuit of all that live;\r\n  Yet few attain it, if ’twas e’er attain’d.                         240\r\n  But they the widest wander from the mark,\r\n  Who thro’ the flow’ry paths of saunt’ring Joy\r\n  Seek this coy Goddess; that from stage to stage\r\n  Invites us still, but shifts as we pursue.\r\n  For, not to name the pains that pleasure brings                    245\r\n  To counterpoise itself, relentless Fate\r\n  Forbids that we thro’ gay voluptuous wilds\r\n  Should ever roam: And were the Fates more kind\r\n  Our narrow luxuries would soon be stale.\r\n  Were these exhaustless, Nature would grow sick,                    250\r\n  And, cloy’d with pleasure, squeamishly complain\r\n  That all was vanity, and life a dream.\r\n  Let nature rest: Be busy for yourself,\r\n  And for your friend; be busy even in vain\r\n  Rather than teize her sated appetites.                             255\r\n  Who never fasts no banquet e’er enjoys;\r\n  Who never toils or watches never sleeps.\r\n  Let nature rest: And when the taste of joy\r\n  Grows keen, indulge; but shun satiety.\r\n\r\n      ’Tis not for mortals always to be blest.                       260\r\n  But him the least the dull or painful hours\r\n  Of life oppress, whom sober Sense conducts\r\n  And Virtue, thro’ this labyrinth we tread.\r\n  Virtue and Sense I mean not to disjoin;\r\n  Virtue and Sense are one; and, trust me, he                        265\r\n  Who has not virtue is not truly wise.\r\n  Virtue (for meer good-nature is a fool)\r\n  Is sense and spirit, with humanity:\r\n  ’Tis sometimes angry, and its frown confounds;\r\n  ’Tis even vindictive, but in vengeance just.                       270\r\n  Knaves fain would laugh at it; some great ones dare;\r\n  But at his heart the most undaunted son\r\n  Of fortune dreads its name and awful charms.\r\n  To noblest uses this determines wealth;\r\n  This is the solid pomp of prosperous days;                         275\r\n  The peace and shelter of adversity.\r\n  And if you pant for glory, build your fame\r\n  On this foundation, which the secret shock\r\n  Defies of Envy and all-sapping Time.\r\n  The gawdy gloss of Fortune only strikes                            280\r\n  The vulgar eye: The suffrage of the wise,\r\n  The praise that’s worth ambition, is attain’d\r\n  By Sense alone, and dignity of mind.\r\n\r\n      Virtue, the strength and beauty of the soul,\r\n  Is the best gift of heaven: a happiness                            285\r\n  That even above the smiles and frowns of fate\r\n  Exalts great Nature’s favourites: a wealth\r\n  That ne’er encumbers, nor to baser hands\r\n  Can be transfer’d: it is the only good\r\n  Man justly boasts of, or can call his own.                         290\r\n  Riches are oft by guilt and baseness earn’d;\r\n  Or dealt by chance, to shield a lucky knave,\r\n  Or throw a cruel sun-shine on a fool.\r\n  But for one end, one much-neglected use,\r\n  Are riches worth your care: (for Nature’s wants                    295\r\n  Are few, and without opulence supplied.)\r\n  This noble end is, to produce the Soul;\r\n  To shew the virtues in their fairest light;\r\n  To make Humanity the Minister\r\n  Of bounteous Providence; and teach the Breast                      300\r\n  That generous luxury the Gods enjoy.\r\n\r\n    Thus, in his graver vein, the friendly Sage\r\n  Sometimes declaim’d. Of Right and Wrong he taught\r\n  Truths as resin’d as ever Athens heard;\r\n  And (strange to tell!) he practis’d what he preach’d.              305\r\n  Skill’d in the Passions, how to check their sway\r\n  He knew, as far as Reason can controul\r\n  The lawless Powers. But other cares are mine:\r\n  Form’d in the school of Pæon, I relate\r\n  What Passions hurt the body, what improve:                         310\r\n  Avoid them, or invite them, as you may.\r\n\r\n      Know then, whatever chearful and serene\r\n  Supports the mind, supports the body too.\r\n  Hence the most vital movement mortals feel\r\n  Is Hope; the balm and life-blood of the soul.                      315\r\n  It pleases, and it lasts. Indulgent heaven\r\n  Sent down the kind delusion, thro’ the paths\r\n  Of rugged life; to lead us patient on;\r\n  And make our happiest state no tedious thing.\r\n  Our greatest good, and what we least can spare.                    320\r\n  Is Hope; the last of all our evils, Fear.\r\n\r\n    But there are Passions grateful to the breast,\r\n  And yet no friends to Life; perhaps they please\r\n  Or to excess, and dissipate the soul;\r\n  Or while they please, torment. The stubborn Clown,                 325\r\n  The ill-tam’d Ruffian, and pale Usurer,\r\n  (If Love’s omnipotence such hearts can mould)\r\n  May safely mellow into love; and grow\r\n  Refin’d, humane, and generous, if they can.\r\n  Love in such bosoms never to a fault                               330\r\n  Or pains or pleases. But ye finer Souls,\r\n  Form’d to soft luxury, and prompt to thrill\r\n  With all the tumults, all the joys and pains,\r\n  That beauty gives; with caution and reserve\r\n  Indulge the sweet destroyer of repose,                             335\r\n  Nor court too much the Queen of charming cares.\r\n  For, while the cherish’d poison in your breast\r\n  Ferments and maddens; sick with jealousy,\r\n  Absence, distrust, or even with anxious joy,\r\n  The wholsome appetites and powers of life                          340\r\n  Dissolve in languor. The coy stomach loaths\r\n  The genial board: Your chearful days are gone:\r\n  The generous bloom that flush’d your cheeks is fled.\r\n  To sighs devoted and to tender pains,\r\n  Pensive you sit, or solitary stray,                                345\r\n  And waste your youth in musing. Musing first\r\n  Toy’d into care your unsuspecting heart:\r\n  It found a liking there, a sportful fire,\r\n  And that fomented into serious love;\r\n  Which musing daily strengthens and improves                        350\r\n  Thro’ all the heights of fondness and romance:\r\n  And you’re undone, the fatal shaft has sped,\r\n  If once you doubt whether you love or no.\r\n  The body wastes away; th’ infected mind,\r\n  Dissolv’d in female tenderness, forgets                            355\r\n  Each manly virtue, and grows dead to fame.\r\n  Sweet heaven from such intoxicating charms\r\n  Defend all worthy breasts! Not that I deem\r\n  Love always dangerous, always to be shun’d.\r\n  Love well repaid, and not too weakly sunk                          360\r\n  In wanton and unmanly tenderness,\r\n  Adds bloom to Health; o’er every virtue sheds\r\n  A gay, humane, and amiable grace,\r\n  And brightens all the ornaments of man.\r\n  But fruitless, hopeless, disappointed, rack’d                      365\r\n  With jealousy, fatigued with hope and fear,\r\n  Too serious, or too languishingly fond,\r\n  Unnerves the body and unmans the soul.\r\n  And some have died for Love; and some run mad;\r\n  And some with desperate hand themselves have slain.                370\r\n\r\n      Some to extinguish, others to prevent,\r\n  A mad devotion to one dangerous Fair,\r\n  Court all they meet; in hopes to dissipate\r\n  The cares of Love amongst a hundred Brides.\r\n  Th’ event is doubtful: for there are who find                      375\r\n  A cure in this; there are who find it not.\r\n  ’Tis no relief, alas! it rather galls\r\n  The wound, to those who are sincerely sick.\r\n  For while from feverish and tumultuous joys\r\n  The nerves grow languid and the soul subsides;                     380\r\n  The tender Fancy smarts with every sting;\r\n  And what was Love before is Madness now.\r\n  Is health your care, or luxury your aim,\r\n  Be temperate still: When Nature bids obey;\r\n  Her wild impatient sallies bear no curb.                           385\r\n  But when the prurient habit of delight,\r\n  Or loose Imagination, spurs you on\r\n  To deeds above your strength, impute it not\r\n  To Nature: Nature all compulsion hates.\r\n  Ah! let nor luxury nor vain renown                                 390\r\n  Urge you to feats you well might sleep without;\r\n  To make what should be rapture a fatigue,\r\n  A tedious task; nor in the wanton arms\r\n  Of twining Laïs melt your manhood down.\r\n  For from the colliquation of soft joys                             395\r\n  How chang’d you rise! the ghost of what you was!\r\n  Languid, and melancholy, and gaunt, and wan;\r\n  Your veins exhausted and your nerves unstrung.\r\n  Spoil’d of its balm and sprightly zest, the blood\r\n  Grows vapid phlegm; along the tender nerves                        400\r\n  (To each slight impulse tremblingly awake)\r\n  A subtle Fiend that mimics all the plagues\r\n  Rapid and restless springs from part to part.\r\n  The blooming honours of your youth are fallen;\r\n  Your vigour pines; your vital powers decay;                        405\r\n  Diseases haunt you; and untimely Age\r\n  Creeps on; unsocial, impotent, and lewd.\r\n  Infatuate, impious, epicure! to waste\r\n  The stores of pleasure, chearfulness, and health!\r\n  Infatuate all who make delight their trade,                        410\r\n  And coy perdition every hour pursue.\r\n\r\n      Who pines with Love, or in lascivious flames\r\n  Consumes, is with his own consent undone:\r\n  He chuses to be wretched, to be mad;\r\n  And warn’d proceeds and wilful to his fate.                        415\r\n  But there’s a Passion, whole tempestuous sway\r\n  Tears up each virtue planted in the breast,\r\n  And shakes to ruins proud philosophy.\r\n  For pale and trembling Anger rushes in,\r\n  With fault’ring speech, and eyes that wildly stare;                420\r\n  Fierce as the Tyger, madder than the seas,\r\n  Desperate, and arm’d with more than human strength.\r\n  How soon the calm, humane, and polish’d man\r\n  Forgets compunction, and starts up a fiend!\r\n  Who pines in Love, or wastes with silent Cares,                    425\r\n  Envy, or Ignominy, or tender Grief,\r\n  Slowly descends and ling’ring to the shades.\r\n  But he whom Anger stings, drops, if he dies,\r\n  At once, and rushes apoplectic down;\r\n  Or a fierce fever hurries him to hell.                             430\r\n  For, as the Body thro’ unnumber’d strings\r\n  Reverberates each vibration of the Soul;\r\n  As is the Passion, such is still the Pain\r\n  The Body feels; or chronic, or acute.\r\n  And oft a sudden storm at once o’erpowers                          435\r\n  The Life, or gives your Reason to the winds.\r\n  Such fates attend the rash alarm of Fear,\r\n  And sudden Grief, and Rage, and sudden Joy.\r\n\r\n      There are, mean time, to whom the boist’rous fit\r\n  Is Health, and only fills the sails of life.                       440\r\n  For where the Mind a torpid winter leads,\r\n  Wrapt in a Body corpulent and cold,\r\n  And each clogg’d function lazily moves on;\r\n  A generous sally spurns th’ incumbent load,\r\n  Unlocks the breast, and gives a cordial glow.                      445\r\n  But if your wrathful blood is apt to boil,\r\n  Or are your nerves too irritably strung;\r\n  Wave all Dispute; be cautious if you joke;\r\n  Keep Lent for ever; and forswear the Bowl.\r\n  For one rash moment sends you to the shades,                       450\r\n  Or shatters every hopeful scheme of life,\r\n  And gives to horror all your days to come.\r\n  Fate, arm’d with thunder, fire, and every plague\r\n  That ruins, tortures, or distracts mankind,\r\n  And makes the happy wretched in an hour,                           455\r\n  O’erwhelms you not with woes so horrible\r\n  As your own Wrath, nor gives more sudden blows.\r\n\r\n      While Choler works, good Friend, you may be wrong;\r\n  Distrust yourself, and sleep before you fight.\r\n  ’Tis not too late to morrow to be brave;                           460\r\n  If Honour bids, to morrow kill or die.\r\n  But calm advice against a raging fit\r\n  Avails too little; and it tries the power\r\n  Of all that ever taught in Prose or Song,\r\n  To tame the Fiend that sleeps a gentle Lamb,                       465\r\n  And wakes a Lion. Unprovok’d and calm,\r\n  You reason well, see as you ought to see,\r\n  And wonder at the madness of mankind:\r\n  Seiz’d with the common rage, you soon forget\r\n  The speculations of your wiser hours.                              470\r\n  Beset with Furies of all deadly shapes,\r\n  Fierce and insidious, violent and slow;\r\n  With all that urge or lure us on to Fate;\r\n  What refuge shall we seek? what arms prepare?\r\n  Where Reason proves too weak, or void of wiles,                    475\r\n  To cope with subtle or impetuous Powers,\r\n  I would invoke new Passions to your aid:\r\n  With Indignation would extinguish Fear,\r\n  With Fear or generous Pity vanquish Rage,\r\n  And Love with Pride; and force to force oppose.                    480\r\n\r\n      There is a Charm: a Power that sways the breast;\r\n  Bids every Passion revel or be still;\r\n  Inspires with Rage, or all your Cares dissolves;\r\n  Can sooth Distraction, and almost Despair.\r\n  That Power is Music: Far beyond the stretch                        485\r\n  Of those unmeaning warblers on our stage;\r\n  Those clumsy Heroes, those fat-headed Gods,\r\n  Who move no Passion justly but Contempt:\r\n  Who, like our dancers (light indeed and strong!)\r\n  Do wond’rous feats, but never heard of grace.                      490\r\n  The fault is ours; we bear those monstrous arts,\r\n  Good Heaven! we praise them: we, with loudest peals,\r\n  Applaud the fool that highest lifts his heels;\r\n  And, with insipid shew of rapture, die\r\n  Of ideot notes, impertinently long.                                495\r\n  But he the Muse’s laurel justly shares,\r\n  A Poet he, and touch’d with Heaven’s own fire;\r\n  Who, with bold rage or solemn pomp of sounds,\r\n  Inflames, exalts, and ravishes the soul;\r\n  Now tender, plaintive, sweet almost to pain,                       500\r\n  In Love dissolves you; now in sprightly strains\r\n  Breathes a gay rapture thro’ your thrilling breast;\r\n  Or melts the heart with airs divinely sad;\r\n  Or wakes to horror the tremendous strings.\r\n  Such was the bard, whose heavenly strains of old                   505\r\n  Appeas’d the fiend of melancholy Saul.\r\n  Such was, if old and heathen fame say true,\r\n  The man who bade the Theban domes ascend,\r\n  And tam’d the savage nations with his song;\r\n  And such the Thracian, whose harmonious lyre,                      510\r\n  Tun’d to soft woe, made all the mountains weep;\r\n  Sooth’d even th’ inexorable powers of Hell,\r\n  And half redeem’d his lost Eurydice.\r\n  Music exalts each Joy, allays each Grief,\r\n  Expells Diseases, softens every Pain,                              515\r\n  Subdues the rage of Poison, and the Plague;\r\n  And hence the wise of ancient days ador’d\r\n  One Power of Physic, Melody, and Song.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The =END=._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Hygeia the goddess of health, was, according to the genealogy\r\nof the heathen deities, the daughter of Esculapius; who, as well as\r\nApollo, was distinguished by the name of Pæon.\r\n\r\n[2] The wild rose, or that which grows upon the wild briar.\r\n\r\n[3] The burning fever.\r\n\r\n[4] Hippocrates.\r\n\r\n[5] In the human body, as well as in those of other animals, the larger\r\nblood-vessels are composed of smaller ones; which, by the violent\r\nmotion and pressure of the fluids in the large vessels, lose their\r\ncavities by degrees, and degenerate into impervious chords or fibres.\r\nIn proportion as these small vessels become solid, the larger must of\r\ncourse grow less extensile, more rigid, and make a stronger resistance\r\nto the action of the heart, and force of the blood.
