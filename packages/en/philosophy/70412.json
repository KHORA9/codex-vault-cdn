And some centuries later the confession of King David in\r\ntime of pestilence took this form: that he had sinned and done wickedly;\r\nbut those sheep—those subjects of his, involved in the penalty of his\r\ntransgression, and dying off like sheep in a flock to the right and left\r\nof him, seventy thousand of them from morning to evening, from Dan even\r\nto Beersheba,—what had they done?\r\n\r\nIf, indeed, says Dr. South, a man could be wicked and a villain to\r\nhimself alone, the mischief would be so much the more tolerable. But the\r\ncase, as he goes on to show, is much otherwise: the guilt of the crime\r\nlights upon one, but the example of it sways a multitude; especially if\r\nthe criminal be of any note or eminence in the world. “For the fall of\r\nsuch a one by any temptation (be it never so plausible) is like that\r\nof a principal stone or stately pillar, tumbling from a lofty edifice\r\ninto the deep mire of the street; it does not only plunge and sink into\r\nthe black dirt itself, but also dashes or bespatters all that are about\r\nit or near it when it falls.” It is by no very subtle and far-fetched\r\nreasoning that a living divine essays to show that we may sin in the\r\npersons of other men, and so may sin in other countries which we never\r\nsaw, and in years after we are in our graves. For may we not, he asks,\r\nbe partakers in other men’s sins of which at their commission we knew\r\nnot, indeed at whose commission we would shudder? May we not in the\r\nmoral world sometimes set the great stone rolling down the hill, with\r\nlittle thought of the ruin it may deal below? “Ah, you may live after\r\nyou are dead, to do mischief; live in the evil thoughts you instilled,\r\nthe false doctrines you taught, the perverted character you helped to\r\nform.” And just as a righteous exemplar, “being dead, yet speaketh,” and\r\nis a living means of good ages after he has been in his grave, “so may\r\nyou, insignificant though you be, have left some impress of yourself upon\r\nminds more powerful than your own, and so be exercising a power to do\r\nharm to people you have never heard of, years after you are dead.” Thus\r\nit is that far down into unknown time, and far away into the unknown\r\ndistance, the moral contagion of our sin may be proved to spread; so that\r\nwe may still be incurring guilt after the green turf is over us, and in\r\nlands which we have never seen and shall never see. “The evil principle\r\nwe instilled, the evil example we set, may ripen into bitter fruit in\r\nthe murderous blow which shall be dealt a century hence upon Australian\r\nplains!” Well may the note of exclamation follow: how strange, yet how\r\ninevitable, the tie which may link our uneventful life with the stormy\r\npassions of numbers far away! More wonderful than even the Atlantic cable\r\nis declared to be that unknown fibre, along which, from other men’s sins,\r\nresponsibility may thrill even to our departed souls: “a chain whose\r\nlinks are formed perhaps of idle words, of forgotten looks, of phrases\r\nof double meaning, of bad advice, of cynical sentiment hardly seriously\r\nmeant; yet carried on through life after life, through soul after soul,\r\ntill the little seed of evil sown by you has developed into some deed of\r\nguilt at which you shudder, but from participation in responsibility for\r\nwhich you cannot clear yourself.” Every sin, we are in fine reminded, may\r\nwaken its echo; every sin is reduplicated and reiterated in other souls\r\nand lives.\r\n\r\nA distinguished French preacher, of the Reformed faith, has a striking\r\ndiscourse on what he entitles the _solidarity_ of evil; and he too\r\ndilates upon the mysterious links which connect together persons and acts\r\nthat appear to have nothing in common,—suggesting melancholy examples of\r\nthe contagion of guilt and its consequences, of the expansive power of\r\ncorruption and its almost boundless results.\r\n\r\nOur most powerful female writer of fiction has emphatically taught,\r\nif a striking story can teach, that there is no sort of wrong deed of\r\nwhich a man can bear the punishment alone; you can’t isolate yourself,\r\nand say that the evil which is in you shall not spread. Men’s lives are\r\nas thoroughly blended with each other as the air they breathe; evil\r\nspreads as necessarily as disease. “I know, I feel the terrible extent of\r\nsuffering this sin of Arthur’s has caused to others,”—so the good rector\r\ntells one who cherishes vengeance on the wrong-doer; “but so does every\r\nsin cause suffering to others besides those who commit it.” The problem\r\nhow far a man is to be held responsible for the unforeseen consequences\r\nof his own deed this speaker pronounces to be one that might well make\r\nus tremble to look into it; the evil consequences that may lie folded\r\nin a single act of selfish indulgence being a thought so awful that it\r\nought surely to awaken some feeling less presumptuous than a rash and\r\nvindictive desire to punish.\r\n\r\nIn another of her books the same authoress takes pains to prove how\r\ndeeply inherent it is in this life of ours that men have to suffer for\r\neach other’s sins; so inevitably diffusive is human suffering that we\r\ncan conceive no retribution which does not spread beyond its mark in\r\npulsations of unmerited pain.\r\n\r\nThere is a passage in one of Madame de Charrière’s letters in which,\r\navowing her full recognition of the fact that she must pay in person for\r\nthe costly experience of life, she expresses the futile wish that others\r\nmight not have to share in the costs, but owns with a sigh that the wish\r\n_is_ futile, for one does nothing absolutely alone she says, and nothing\r\nso happens to us as to entirely exclude the participation of others: “_On\r\nne fait rien tout seul, et il ne nous arrive rien à nous seuls._” We are\r\ntaught by modern science that the slightest movement, of the smallest\r\nbody, in the remotest region, produces results which are perpetual, which\r\ndiffuse themselves through all space, and which, though they may be\r\nmetamorphosed, cannot be destroyed.[1] Or again, as Mrs. Browning reminds\r\nus,—\r\n\r\n    “Each creature holds an insular point in space:\r\n    Yet what man stirs a finger, breathes a sound,\r\n    But all the multitudinous beings round,\r\n    In all the countless worlds, with time and place\r\n    For their conditions, down to the central base,\r\n    Thrill, haply, in vibration and rebound,\r\n    Life answering life across the vast profound,\r\n    In full antiphony....”\r\n\r\nIf no good work that a man does is lost—the smallest useful work, as an\r\noctogenarian essayist assures us, continuing to be useful long after the\r\nman is dead and forgotten, so neither do bad actions die with the doer.\r\n“Future generations suffer for the sin of their ancestors, and one great\r\ncrime or act of folly causes the misery of unborn millions.” So all\r\nthings, it is added, hang together in one unbroken chain, of which we see\r\na few links, but the beginning and the end we see not and never shall see.\r\n\r\nSeneca was writing for all time when he said that no man’s error is\r\nconfined to himself, but affects all around him, whether by example, or\r\nconsequences, or both: “_nemo errat uni sibi_.” A latter-day philosopher\r\nassigns to a place among the most insoluble riddles propounded to mortal\r\ncomprehension what he calls the fatal decree by which every crime is\r\nmade to be the agony of many innocent persons as well as of the single\r\nguilty one. “Ah!” exclaims Hilda to guilty Miriam, in the story of\r\n“Transformation,”—“now I understand how the sins of generations past\r\nhave created an atmosphere of sin for those that follow. While there is\r\na single guilty person in the universe, each innocent one must feel his\r\ninnocence tortured by that guilt. Your deed, Miriam, has darkened the\r\nwhole sky!” To apply the lines of a reflective poet,—\r\n\r\n    “’Tis not their own crimes only, men commit;\r\n    They harrow them into another’s breast,\r\n    And they shall reap the growth with bitter pain.”\r\n\r\nVery forcibly Mr. Isaac Taylor warns us that in almost every event of\r\nlife the remote consequences vastly outweigh the proximate in actual\r\namount of importance; and he undertakes to show, on principles even of\r\nmathematical calculation, that each individual of the human family holds\r\nin his hand the centre lines of an interminable web-work, on which are\r\nsustained the fortunes of multitudes of his successors; the implicated\r\nconsequences, if summed together, making up therefore a weight of human\r\nweal or woe that is reflected back with an incalculable momentum upon\r\nthe lot of each. The practical conclusion is that every one is bound to\r\nremember that the personal sufferings or peculiar vicissitudes or toils\r\nthrough which he is called to pass are to be estimated and explained only\r\nin an immeasurably small proportion if his single welfare is regarded,\r\nwhile their “full price and value are not to be computed unless the drops\r\nof the morning dew could be numbered.” So the most popular of domestic\r\nstory-tellers expatiates in an early work on the impossibility of wiping\r\noff from us, as with a wet cloth, the stains left by the fault of those\r\nwho are near to us. Another of the tribe, but more “sensational” in\r\nsubject and style, is keen to show how the influence of a man’s evil deed\r\nslowly percolates through insidious channels of which he never dreams;\r\nhow the deed of folly or of guilt is still active for evil when the\r\nsinner who committed it has forgotten his wickedness. “Who shall say\r\nwhere or when the results of one man’s evil-doing shall cease? The seed\r\nof sin engenders no common root, shooting straight upwards through the\r\nearth, and bearing a given crop. It is the germ of a foul running weed,\r\nwhose straggling suckers travel underground beyond the ken of mortal\r\neye, beyond the power of mortal calculation.” And so again the caustic\r\nshowman of “Vanity Fair,” in his last completed work, paused to explain\r\nhow a culprit’s evil behaviour of five and twenty years back, brought\r\npresent grief and loss of rest to three unoffending persons; and he\r\ncharacteristically utters the wistful wish that we “could all take the\r\npunishment for our individual crimes on our individual shoulders,” but\r\nlaments the futility of any such wish, recognising as he does so plainly\r\nthat when the culprit is condemned to hang, it is those connected with\r\nhim who have to weep and suffer, and wear piteous mourning in their\r\nhearts long after he has jumped off the Tyburn ladder.\r\n\r\nWe conclude with a suggestive stanza of Mr. Robert Browning’s, worth\r\nlearning by heart in more senses than one: he is speaking of the soul\r\ndeclaring itself by its fruit—the thing it does:—\r\n\r\n    “Be Hate that fruit, or Love that fruit,\r\n      It forwards the general deed of Man;\r\n    And each of the many helps to recruit\r\n      The life of the race by a general plan,\r\n    Each living his own, to boot.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_SILENT SYMPATHY._\r\n\r\nJOB ii. 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nJob’s friends have long since been a sort of bye-word. But be it not\r\nforgotten that the friendship of Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, to the\r\nruined and desolate man of Uz, evidences itself as very genuine in one\r\nor two salient points, before it came to be, what it is apt to be now\r\nexclusively considered, all talk. Before the talk there was prolonged\r\nsilence; and before the silence there was lamentation of undoubted\r\nearnest. Coming from afar to mourn with him, and to comfort him,\r\nfrom afar off they caught sight of him, but so altered—_heu, quantum\r\nmutatus!_—that they lifted up their voice and wept; and they rent each\r\none his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads towards heaven. And\r\nthen they “sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights,\r\n_and none spake a word unto him_; for they saw that his grief was very\r\ngreat.”\r\n\r\nThe sonnet of a Quaker poet has thus far vindicated the sincerity of\r\ntheir friendship, and on the ground of their silent sympathy:\r\n\r\n    “However ye might err in after-speech,\r\n      The mute expression of that voiceless woe\r\n      Whereby ye sought your sympathy to show\r\n    With him of Uz, doth eloquently preach,—\r\n    Teaching a lesson it were well to teach\r\n      Some comforters, of utterance less slow,\r\n      Prone to believe that they more promptly know\r\n    Grief’s mighty depths, and by their words can reach.\r\n    _Seven days and nights_, in stillness as profound\r\n      As that of chaos, patiently ye sate\r\n      By the heart-stricken and the desolate.\r\n    And though your sympathy might fail to sound\r\n    The fathomless depth of his dark spirit’s wound,\r\n      Not less your silence was sublimely great.”\r\n\r\nIn his vivid picture of the desolation of a bereaved husband, Sir Richard\r\nSteele goes on to say, “I knew consolation would now be impertinent;\r\nand therefore contented myself to sit by him, and condole with him in\r\nsilence.” “_Les consolations indiscrètes_,” says Rousseau, “_ne font\r\nqu’aigrir les violentes afflictions. L’indifférence et la froideur\r\ntrouvent aisément des paroles, mais la tristesse et LE SILENCE sont alors\r\nle vrai langage de l’amitié_.” Gray writes to Mason, while yet uncertain\r\nwhether the latter is already a widower or not,—“If the last struggle be\r\nover ... allow me (at least in idea, for what could I do were I present\r\nmore than this,) to sit by you in silence, and pity from my heart, not\r\nher who is at rest, but you who lose her.” So it happened that Mason\r\nreceived this little billet at almost the precise moment when it would be\r\nmost affecting.\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole, again, writes to an afflicted correspondent,—“I say no\r\nmore, for time only, not words, can soften such afflictions, nor can any\r\nconsolations be suggested, that do not more immediately occur to the\r\npersons afflicted. To moralize can comfort those only who do not want to\r\nbe comforted.” So Marcia replies to Lucia, in Addison’s tragedy:\r\n\r\n    “_Lucia._ What can I think or say to give thee comfort?\r\n\r\n    _Marcia._ Talk not of comfort, ’tis for lighter ills.”\r\n\r\nWords are words, says Shakspeare’s Brabantio, and never yet heard he\r\nthat the bruised heart was relieved through the ear. When, towards the\r\nclose of Campbell’s metrical tale of fair Wyoming, on Susquehanna’s side,\r\n“prone to the dust, afflicted Waldegrave hid his face on earth, him\r\nwatched, in gloomy ruth, his woodland guide; but words had none to soothe\r\nthe grief that knows not consolation’s name.” But the Oneyda chief was\r\nnot on that account Waldegrave’s least efficient comforter. What though\r\nothers around him, less reticent, and more demonstrative, found utterance\r\neasy, and shaped their kind common-place meaning into kind common-place\r\nwords? “Of them that stood encircling his despair, he heard some friendly\r\nwords, but knew not what they were.” Wise-hearted, too, was Southey’s\r\nyoung Arabian, in watching silently the frantic grief of the newly\r\nchildless old diviner: in pitying silence Thalaba stood by, and gazed,\r\nand listened: “not with the officious hand of consolation, fretting\r\nthe sore wound he could not hope to heal.” It has been called the last\r\ntriumph of affection and magnanimity, when a loving heart can respect the\r\nsuffering silence of its beloved, and allow that lonely liberty in which\r\nalone some natures can find comfort. A late author portrayed in one of\r\nhis tales a dull, common-place fellow enough, of limited intellect and\r\nattainments, whose, however, was one of those kind and honest natures\r\nfortunately endowed with subtle powers of perception that lie deeper than\r\nthe head. Accordingly he is described, in the capacity of an unofficious\r\ncondoler, as appreciating perfectly the grief of his friend; at his\r\nside throughout the day, but never obtruding himself, never attempting\r\njarring platitudes of condolence: “in a word he fully understood the deep\r\nand beautiful sympathy of silence.” So with Adela and Caroline in _The\r\nBertrams_,—interchanging those pressures of the hand, those mute marks of\r\nfellow-feeling, “which we all know so well how to give when we long to\r\nlighten the sorrows which are too deep to be probed by words.” But though\r\nwe all may know so well how to give these mute marks, we do not all and\r\nalways practice what we know. ’Tis true, ’tis pity; pity ’tis ’tis true.\r\n\r\nAdam Bede’s outburst of maddened feelings, uttered in tones of appealing\r\nanguish, when the loss of Hetty is first made clear to him, is noted in\r\nsilence by the discreet rector, who is too wise to utter soothing words\r\nat present, as he watches in Adam that look of sudden age which sometimes\r\ncomes over a young face in moments of terrible emotion. As Bartle Massey\r\nelsewhere describes this silent sympathizer, “Ay, he’s good metal; ...\r\nsays no more than’s needful. He’s not one of those that think they can\r\ncomfort you with chattering, as if folks who stand by and look on knew a\r\ndeal better what the trouble was than those who have to bear it.”\r\n\r\nMadame de Sévigné frankly deposes of her capacity as regards wordy\r\nconsolation: “_Pour moi, je ne sais point de paroles dans une telle\r\noccasion._” Mr. Tennyson submits what is applicable to any _telle\r\noccasion_,\r\n\r\n      “That only silence suiteth best.\r\n    Words weaker than your grief would make\r\n    Grief more. ’Twere better I should cease.”\r\n\r\nMiss Procter sings the praises of a true comforter in little Effie,—“just\r\nI think that she does not try,—only looks with a wistful wonder why grown\r\npeople should ever cry.” It is such a comfort to be able to cry in peace,\r\nadds that sweet singer (with _larmes dans la voix_):\r\n\r\n    “And my comforter knows a lesson\r\n      Wiser, truer than all the rest:—\r\n    That to help and to heal a sorrow,\r\n      Love and silence are always best.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE TEMPTER’S “IT IS WRITTEN.”_\r\n\r\nMATTHEW iv. 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n“It is written,” said the Tempter, quoting Scripture for his purpose,\r\nwhen it was his hour and the power of darkness, in the day of temptation\r\nin the wilderness. The quotation was refuted on the spot, and the Tempter\r\nwas foiled. But his failure has not deterred mankind, at sundry times and\r\nin divers manners, from venturing on the same appeal, with no very unlike\r\ndesign. The wise as serpents (there was a serpent in Eden) who are not\r\nalso harmless as doves, have now and then essayed to round a sophistic\r\nperiod, or clench an immoral argument, with an _It is written_.\r\n\r\nAmong the crowd of pilgrims who throng the pages of his allegory,\r\nBunyan depicts one Mr. Selfwill, who holds that a man may follow the\r\nvices as well as the virtues of pilgrims; and that if he does both, he\r\nshall certainly be saved. But what ground has he for so saying? is Mr.\r\nGreatheart’s query. And old Mr. Honesty replies, “Why, he said he had\r\nScripture for his warrant.” He could cite David’s practice in one bad\r\ndirection, and Sarah’s lying in another, and Jacob’s dissimulation in a\r\nthird. And what they did, he might do too. “I have heard him plead for\r\nit, bring Scripture for it, bring arguments for it,” etc., quoth old\r\nHonesty with a degree of indignation that does credit to his name.\r\n\r\n    “The devil can quote Scripture for his purpose.\r\n    An evil soul, producing holy witness,\r\n    Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,\r\n    A goodly apple rotten at the core.”\r\n\r\nSuch is Antonio’s stricture on Shylock’s appeal to Jacob’s practice,\r\n“When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban’s sheep”; and there is a parallel\r\npassage in the next act, where Bassanio is the speaker:—\r\n\r\n                      “In religion,\r\n    What damnèd error but some sober brow\r\n    Will bless it and approve it with a text,\r\n    Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?”\r\n\r\nAgainst divines, indeed, of every school and age, the reproach of citing\r\na text in support of doctrine or practice the reverse of divine, has been\r\nfreely cast, with more or less of reason. Orthodox and heterodox, each\r\nhas flung against the other his retort uncourteous.\r\n\r\n    “Have not all heretics the same pretence\r\n    To plead the Scriptures in their own defence?\r\n    How did the Nicene Council then decide\r\n    That strong debate? Was it by Scripture tried?\r\n    No, sure; to that the rebel would not yield:\r\n    Squadrons of texts _he_ marshall’d in the field.\r\n    ...\r\n    With texts point-blank and plain he faced the foe;\r\n    And did not Satan tempt our Saviour so?”\r\n\r\nA Dublin synod of the Irish Roman Catholic bishops, a few years since,\r\nwhich distinguished itself by its enthusiasm for Pope Pius IX., against\r\nthe King of Italy, and by its arrogation of a divine right of practical\r\nmonopoly in overseeing the schools and colleges of Ireland, was made the\r\ntheme of comment by unsympathetic British critics; who remarked that\r\nwhen the question of education is stirred in such quarters, the dullest\r\nheretic can divine that the national system is to be denounced; and that\r\nit is easy to guess at the text of Scripture to be quoted in support\r\nof the pretensions of the Church. “The command to ‘go and teach all\r\nnations’ vested in the successors of the Apostles a rightful monopoly\r\nof instruction in Greek, mathematics, and civil engineering.” According\r\nto the same elastic authority, the “Puritans,” we are reminded, were\r\njustified in shooting and hanging their enemies, because Samuel hewed\r\nAgag in pieces, or because Phineas arose and executed judgment. “There\r\nnever was a proposition which could not be proved by a text; and perhaps\r\nthe effect is more complete when the citation is taken from the Vulgate.”\r\nGray’s malicious lines against Lord Sandwich, a notorious evil-liver,\r\nas candidate for the High Stewardship in the University of Cambridge,\r\ninclude this stanza, supposed to be uttered by a representative D.D.,\r\nof the old port-wine school, and a staunch supporter of his profligate\r\nlordship:\r\n\r\n    “Did not Israel filch from th’ Egyptians of old\r\n    Their jewels of silver and jewels of gold?\r\n    The prophet of Bethel, we read, told a lie;\r\n    He[2] drinks—so did Noah:—he swears—so do I.”\r\n\r\nGray’s _jeu d’esprit_ was, throughout, not in the best of taste; but it\r\nwas vastly relished at the time, as an election squib. The reference\r\nto spoiling the Egyptians is a well worked one in the history of\r\nquotations. Coleridge has a story of a Mameluke Bey, whose “precious\r\nlogic” extorted a large contribution from the Egyptian Jews. “These\r\nbooks, the Pentateuch, are authentic?” “Yes.” “Well, the debt then is\r\nacknowledged: and now the receipt, or the money, or your heads! The Jews\r\nborrowed a large treasure from the Egyptians; but you are the Jews, and\r\non you, therefore, I call for the repayment.” Such conclusions, from such\r\npremises, and backed by such vouchers, are open to logicians of every\r\norder, sacred and profane.\r\n\r\n    “Hence comment after comment, spun as fine\r\n    As bloated spiders draw the flimsy line;\r\n    Hence the same word that bids our lusts obey,\r\n    Is misapplied to sanctify their sway.\r\n    If stubborn Greek refuse to be his friend,\r\n    Hebrew or Syriac shall be forced to bend:\r\n    If languages and copies all cry, No!\r\n    Somebody proved it centuries ago.”\r\n\r\nBurns was never any too backward in having his fling at a “minister”; and\r\nthere is exceptional (and perhaps exceptionable) gusto in his averment\r\nthat,\r\n\r\n    “E’en ministers, they have been kenn’d,\r\n                          In holy rapture,\r\n    A rousing _whid_, at times, to vend,\r\n                          And nail’t wi’ Scripture.”\r\n\r\nThere was a time in the life of Diderot when that freest of free-thinkers\r\nmade a living, such as it was, by writing sermons to order—half a dozen\r\nof them, for instance, a missionary bespoke for the Portuguese colonies,\r\nand is said to have paid for them very handsomely at fifty crowns each.\r\nMr. Carlyle is caustic in his commemoration of this incident in Denis\r\nDiderot’s career. “Further, he made sermons, to order; as the Devil is\r\nsaid to quote Scripture.” In Mr. Carlyle’s latest and longest history,\r\nwe find once and again the like allusion. Frederick William, and his\r\nadvisers, bent on a certain match for the Princess Wilhelmina, which the\r\nqueen, her mother, as steadfastly opposed, took to quoting Scripture by\r\nway of subduing her majesty’s resistance. “There was much discourse,\r\nsuasive, argumentative. Grumkow quoting Scripture on her majesty, as the\r\ndevil can on occasion,” says Wilhelmina. “Express scriptures, ‘Wives,\r\nbe obedient to your husbands,’ and the like texts; but her majesty,\r\non the Scripture side, too, gave him as much as he brought.” And at a\r\nlater stage of the negotiation, the same Grumkow appears again, citing\r\nthe Vulgate to a confidential correspondent, in reference to their\r\npolitical schemings. “But ‘_Si Deus est nobiscum_’—‘If God be for us, who\r\ncan be against us?’ For the Grumkow can quote Scripture; nay, solaces\r\nhimself with it, which is a feat beyond what the devil is competent\r\nto.” Shakespeare embodies in Richard of Gloster a type of the political\r\nintriguer of this complexion; as where that usurper thus answers the\r\ngulled associates who urge him to be avenged on the opposite faction:\r\n\r\n    “But then I sigh, and with a piece of Scripture,\r\n    Tell them, that God bids us do good for evil.\r\n    And thus I clothe my naked villany\r\n    With old odd ends, stolen forth of holy writ;\r\n    And seem a saint when most I play the devil.”\r\n\r\nAn unmitigated scoundrel in one of Mr. Dickens’s books is represented as\r\novertly grudging his old father the scant remnant of his days, and citing\r\nholy writ for sanction of his complaint. “Why, a man of any feeling ought\r\nto be ashamed of being eighty—let alone any more. Where’s his religion,\r\nI should like to know, when he goes flying in the face of the Bible like\r\nthat? Threescore and ten’s the mark; and no man with a conscience,\r\nand a proper sense of what’s expected of him, has any business to live\r\nlonger.” Whereupon the author interposes this parenthetical comment, and\r\nhighly characteristic it is: “Is any one surprised at Mr. Jonas making\r\nsuch a reference to such a book for such a purpose? Does any one doubt\r\nthe old saw that the devil ... quotes Scripture for his own ends? If he\r\nwill take the trouble to look about him, he may find a greater number\r\nof confirmations of the fact in the occurrences of a single day than\r\nthe steam-gun can discharge balls in a minute.” Fiction would supply us\r\nwith abundant illustrations—fiction in general, and Sir Walter Scott in\r\nparticular. As where Simon of Hackburn, the martial borderer, backs his\r\nhot appeal to arms, for the avenging a deed of wrong, by an equivocal\r\nreference to holy writ. “Let women sit and greet at hame, men must do as\r\nthey have been done by; it is the Scripture says it.” “Haud your tongue,\r\nsir,” exclaims one of the seniors, sternly; “dinna abuse the Word that\r\ngate; ye dinna ken what ye speak about.” Or as where the Templar essays\r\nto corrupt the Jewess by citing the examples of David and Solomon: “If\r\nthou readest the Scriptures,” retorts Rebecca, “and the lives of the\r\nsaints, only to justify thine own licence and profligacy, thy crime\r\nis like that of him who extracteth poison from the most healthful and\r\nnecessary herbs.” One other example. Undy Scott, that plausible scamp\r\nof Mr. Trollope’s making, propounds an immoral paradox, to the scope of\r\nwhich one of his dupes is bold enough to object. But how is the objector\r\ndisposed of? “‘Judge not, and ye shall not be judged,’ said Undy, quoting\r\nScripture, as the devil did before him.” Dupes can quote Scripture, too,\r\nand perhaps that is more demoralizing still. For Cowper did not rhyme\r\nwithout reason when he declared, that\r\n\r\n    “Of all the arts sagacious dupes invent,\r\n    To cheat themselves, and gain the world’s assent,\r\n    The worst is—Scripture warped from its intent.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_ROYALTY REMINDED OF THE POOR._\r\n\r\nDANIEL iv. 27.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat was Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, even as the tree that he saw in\r\nhis dream; for, by the avowal of the Hebrew prophet who interpreted that\r\ndream, the king was indeed become strong, and his greatness was grown,\r\nand reached unto the heaven, and his dominion unto the ends of the earth.\r\nBut sentence had gone forth, as against the tree, so against the king.\r\nNebuchadnezzar was to be degraded; despoiled of his kingdom, cast down\r\nfrom his throne, and driven from men, to eat grass as oxen. This counsel,\r\nhowever, the prophet urged upon the sovran, that he should break off his\r\nsins by righteousness, and his “iniquities by showing mercy to the poor”;\r\nif it might be a lengthening of his tranquillity, or a healing of his\r\nerror.\r\n\r\nWhat error? That of which ex-king Lear accused himself, when he\r\nowned, amid words of frenzy, all however with more or less of tragic\r\nsignificance in them, that he had taken too little care of _this_,—of\r\nsympathy with desolate indigence, and of readiness to relieve the\r\nsufferings of the destitute and forlorn.\r\n\r\nThe storm is raging on the heath, and faithful Kent implores his aged\r\nmaster to take shelter, such as it is, within a hovel hard by; some\r\nfriendship will it lend him against the tempest; the tyranny of the open\r\nnight’s too rough for nature to endure. But Lear would be let alone.\r\n“Wilt break my heart?” he exclaims, in answer to Kent’s fresh entreaty:\r\nKent had rather break his own. Again the drenched, discrowned old man is\r\nurged to enter the hovel on the heath. But he stays outside, to reason on\r\nhis past and present, till reason gives way. Kent may think it a matter\r\nof moment that this contentious storm invades them to the skin; and so\r\nit is to him. But Lear has deeper griefs to shatter him; and “where the\r\ngreater malady is fixed, the lesser is scarce felt.” Let Kent go in,\r\nby all means: the king enjoins it—at least the ex-king desires it: let\r\nKent seek his own ease—and perhaps Lear will follow him in. Meanwhile,\r\nin draggling robes, drenched to the skin, chilled to the heart, Lear’s\r\nthoughts perforce are turned to “houseless poverty,” to the indigent and\r\nvagrant creatures once, and so lately, his subjects, equally exposed\r\nto the downpour of the wrathful skies, of whom he had seldom, if ever,\r\nthought till now. Poor naked wretches, he apostrophises them, wheresoever\r\nthey are, that bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,—how shall their\r\nhouseless heads, and unfed sides, their looped and windowed raggedness,\r\ndefend them from seasons such as these? And then, in an outburst of\r\nrepentant self-reproach, he that had been King of Britain breaks forth\r\ninto the avowal,\r\n\r\n                        “O, I have ta’en\r\n    Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp;\r\n    Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel;\r\n    That thou mayst shake the superflux to them,\r\n    And show the heavens more just.”\r\n\r\nBetween the history of Lear and that of Gloster, in the same play, there\r\nis a curious and significant parallel maintained throughout. And it is\r\nobservable that when Gloster too, another duped and outcast father, is\r\nwandering in his turn on the same heath, and is accosted by “poor mad\r\nTom,”—the sightless, miserable father thus addresses the “naked fellow”\r\nwhose identity he so little suspects:\r\n\r\n    “Here, take this purse, thou whom the heaven’s plagues\r\n    Have humbled to all strokes: that I am wretched,\r\n    Makes thee the happier:—Heavens, deal so still!\r\n    Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,\r\n    That slaves your ordinance, that will not see\r\n    Because he doth not feel, feel your power quickly;\r\n    So distribution should undo the excess,\r\n    And each man have enough.”\r\n\r\nStrictly a parallel passage to the one just cited from the lips of Lear,\r\neven as the disastrous personal experiences of King of Britain and Duke\r\nof Gloster were along parallel lines, as we have said.\r\n\r\nThe words of Amos, the herdman of Tekoa, include a denunciation of woe to\r\nthem that lie upon beds of ivory, and eat the lambs out of the flock,\r\nand the calves out of the midst of the stall, and drink wine in bowls,\r\nand anoint themselves with costly ointments, and chant to the sound of\r\nthe viol,—but are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph. As the minor\r\nprophet with his woe to them that are thus at ease in Zion, so a major\r\nprophet declares this to have been the iniquity of a doomed race—pride,\r\nfulness of bread, and abundance of idleness, with disregard of all\r\nmeans to strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. Lazarus the beggar\r\nwas, as some scholars interpret the passage, “content to be fed” on the\r\ncrumbs which fell from the rich man’s table; in which case he would not\r\nappear to have been refused the crumbs: indeed, had this been the case,\r\nit would scarcely, they contend, have been omitted in the rebuke of\r\nAbraham. “The rich man’s sins were ravenousness and negligence rather\r\nthan inhumanity.”[3] He took too little care of this—that beggary lay in\r\nhelpless prostration before his doorway, the while he clothed himself in\r\npurple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day.\r\n\r\nLa Bruyère observes that “la santé et les richesses ôtent aux hommes\r\nl’expérience du mal, leur inspirent la dureté pour leurs semblables;”\r\nand adds, that “les gens déjà chargés de leur propre misère sont ceux\r\nqui entrent davantage, par leur compassion, dans celle d’autrui.” If\r\nthese by comparison become wondrous kind, it is their fellow-feeling that\r\nmakes them so. _Haud ignari mali, miseris succurrere discunt._ In another\r\nchapter of his “Characters,” La Bruyère sketches the portrait of one he\r\nstyles Champagne, who “au sortir d’un long dîner qui lui enfle l’estomac,\r\net dans les douces fumées d’un vin d’Avenay ou de Sillery, signe un\r\nordre qu’on lui présente, qui ôterait le pain à toute une province, si\r\nl’on n’y remédiait: il est excusable. Quel moyen de comprendre, dans\r\nla première heure de la digestion, qu’on puisse quelque part mourir de\r\nfaim?” _Il est excusable_, on the principle of Horace Walpole’s similar\r\nplea, or apology, for unheeding royalty. He writes to Miss Hannah More\r\nthat he used to hate that king and t’other prince—but that on reflection\r\nhe found the censure ought to fall on human nature in general. “They\r\nare made of the same stuff as we, and dare we say what we should be in\r\ntheir situation? Poor creatures! think how they are educated, or rather\r\ncorrupted, early, how flattered! To be educated properly, they should\r\nbe led through hovels [as Lear was on the heath—somewhat late in life],\r\nand hospitals, and prisons. Instead of being reprimanded (and perhaps\r\nimmediately afterwards _sugar-plum’d_) for not learning their Latin or\r\nFrench grammar, they now and then should be kept fasting; and, if they\r\ncut their finger, should have no plaster till it festered. No part of a\r\nroyal brat’s memory, which is good enough, should be burthened but with\r\nthe remembrance of human suffering.” “_Il y a une espèce de honte d’être\r\nheureux à la vue de certaines misères_,” writes La Bruyère again. Adam\r\nSmith, however, made a dead set against what he calls those “whining and\r\nmelancholy moralists,” who he complains, are perpetually reproaching us\r\nwith our happiness, while so many of our brethren are in misery, who\r\nregard as impious the natural joy of prosperity, which does not think of\r\nthe many wretches that are at every instant labouring under all sorts\r\nof calamities, in the languor of poverty, in the agony of disease, etc.\r\n“Commiseration for those miseries which we never saw, which we never\r\nheard of, but which we may be assured are at all times infesting such\r\nnumbers of our fellow-creatures, ought, they think, to damp the pleasures\r\nof the fortunate, and to render a certain melancholy dejection habitual\r\nto all men.” Adam Smith opposes this “extreme sympathy” as altogether\r\nabsurd and unreasonable; as unattainable too, so that a certain affected\r\nand sentimental sadness is the nearest approach that can be made to it;\r\nand he further declares that this disposition of mind, though it could be\r\nattained, would be perfectly useless, and could serve no other purpose\r\nthan to render miserable the person who possessed it. This, of course,\r\nis assuming the wretchedness in question to be beyond the sympathiser’s\r\nrelief. Dr. Smith may be supposed to have had in view Thomson’s\r\ncelebrated passage:\r\n\r\n    “Ah! little think the gay licentious proud,\r\n    Whom pleasure, power, and affluence surround;\r\n    They, who their thoughtless hours in giddy mirth,\r\n    And wanton, often cruel, riot waste;\r\n    Ah! little think they, while they dance along,\r\n    How many feel this very moment death\r\n    And all the sad variety of pain.”\r\n\r\nMany variations on that theme of sad variety the poet sings: moving\r\naccidents by flood and fire,—pining want, and dungeon glooms,—the\r\nmany who drink the cup of baleful grief, or eat the bitter bread of\r\nmisery—sore pierced by wintry winds, how many shrink into the sordid hut\r\nof cheerless poverty (the hovel on the heath again), etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\n                  “Thought fond man\r\n    Of these, and all the thousand nameless ills\r\n    That one incessant struggle render life\r\n    One scene of toil, of suffering, and of fate,\r\n    Vice in his high career would stand appalled,\r\n    And heedless rambling impulse learn to think;\r\n    The conscious heart of charity would warm,\r\n    And her wide wish benevolence dilate;\r\n    The social tear would rise, the social sigh,\r\n    And into clear perfection, gradual bliss,\r\n    Refining still, the social passions work.”\r\n\r\nThis may, perhaps, said Baron Alderson, in winding up a charge to a\r\ngrand jury, whom he exhorted at that winter season to show sympathy and\r\nkindness to the distressed,—this, perhaps, may be one of the objects\r\nfor which God sends suffering, that it may tend to re-unite those whom\r\nprosperity has severed. So Burns—\r\n\r\n      “O ye who, sunk in beds of down,\r\n    Feel not a want but what yourselves create,\r\n    Think for a moment on his wretched fate\r\n      Whom friends and fortune quite disown.\r\n    Ill-satisfied keen nature’s clam’rous call,\r\n      Stretch’d on his straw he lays himself to sleep,\r\n    While through the ragged roof and chinky wall,\r\n      Chill, o’er his slumbers, piles the drifty heap.\r\n    ...\r\n    Affliction’s sons are brothers in distress:\r\n    A brother to relieve, how exquisite the bliss!”\r\n\r\nAgain and again the question recurs, to quote from an able casuist on\r\ncasual charity, why one man should be literally dying of want, whilst\r\nanother is able to send him a cheque for £100 without thinking about it,\r\nor knowing that the money is gone? If Dives, it is asked, feels bound to\r\ngive Lazarus so much, where does he draw the line? If the demand upon the\r\nsuperfluities of the rich is to be measured by the wants of the poor,\r\nwhy stop at £100 rather than £1000 or £10,000 or £100,000? “This is the\r\nquestion which lies at the root of half the melancholy sarcasms and still\r\nmore melancholy wit of the present day. The writings of such men as Hood\r\nare little more than embodiments of it in a variety of forms, ludicrous\r\nor pathetic. It forms the burden of a whole class of literature, not the\r\nless influential because it is somewhat vague in its doctrines, and rests\r\nrather on sentiments than on dogmas.” Now this writer believes it to be\r\nalways the best to look such questions in the face, and to attempt at\r\nleast to give the true answer to them. And the answer, at least in part,\r\nin this instance, he takes to be that the antithesis is only sentimental,\r\nand not logical. The poverty of the very poor is not, he contends, either\r\na cause or an effect of the riches of the very rich, nor would it be\r\nrelieved by their permanent impoverishment. “That it is not a cause of\r\ntheir riches, is obvious from the fact that if by any change pauperism\r\nand misery were suddenly abolished, the rich would be all the richer.”\r\nBut not to follow out a line of argument that would take us too far\r\nafield, we may advert to a corresponding essay, in the same _Review_,\r\nif not by the same contributor,—in which a picture is drawn of a rich\r\nman at church, who hears some stray verses in the second lesson, or some\r\neloquent menace from the pulpit, which makes him very uncomfortable about\r\nthe contrast between his own easy life and the massive wretchedness of\r\nSpitalfields or Poplar. The uneasiness is supposed to rankle in him for\r\nsome time, spoiling his digestion, and making him very cross to his wife\r\nand daughters. Not that he “for a moment dreams of literally obeying the\r\ntexts in the New Testament that have hit him hard; for he has a shrewd\r\nnotion that they imply a very different state of society from the busy\r\nnineteenth century. He feels that he has no time for visiting the sick,\r\nand that if he had, the sick would think him a great nuisance; and he\r\nknows that when he got to the bedside, he would probably be at his wits’\r\nends for anything to say, and would end by twisting his watch-chain,\r\nand remarking that it was a cold day.” The practical inference is, that\r\nif he is to do any of the corporal works of mercy, he must do them by\r\ncommission;—and so, at last, the irritation in his conscience throws\r\nitself out in the form of a liberal cheque upon his bankers. _He_, at\r\nleast, will vindicate himself, so far as that vicarious beneficence may\r\navail, from any possible charge of branded fellowship with such as the\r\npoet of the Seasons depicts, in\r\n\r\n                “The cruel wretch\r\n    Who, all day long in sordid pleasure rolled,\r\n    Himself a useless load, has squandered vile\r\n    Upon his scoundrel train, what might have cheered\r\n    A drooping family of modest worth.”\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole, on being complimented by letter on the patience with\r\nwhich he bore an acute attack of his chronic malady, replies: “If people\r\nof easy fortunes cannot bear illness with temper, what are the poor\r\nto do, who have none of our comforts and alleviations? The affluent,\r\nI fear, do not consider what a benefit-ticket has fallen to their lot\r\nout of millions not so fortunate; yet less do they reflect that chance,\r\nnot merit, drew the prize out of the wheel.” Crabbe portrays this\r\nnon-reflecting complacency in one of his metrical tales:\r\n\r\n    “Month after month was passed, and all were spent\r\n    In quiet comfort and in rich content:\r\n    Miseries there were, and woes, the world around,\r\n    But these had not her pleasant dwelling found;\r\n    She knew that mothers grieved, and widows wept,\r\n    And she was sorry, said her prayers, and slept.\r\n    Thus passed the seasons, and to Dinah’s board\r\n    Gave what the seasons to the rich afford;\r\n    For she indulged,” etc.\r\n\r\nNot so serenely does Bishop Jeremy Taylor imagine a gazer from the skies\r\nto look down on the sorrows of this earth of ours, in the celebrated\r\nparagraph beginning, “But if we could from one of the battlements of\r\nheaven espy how many men and women lie fainting and dying,” etc. And,\r\nby the way, there is another of Crabbe’s Tales, in which, too late,\r\na self-upbraiding spirit thus accuses itself for neglecting a ruined\r\nwrong-doer, whose death she has just discovered:\r\n\r\n    “To have this money in my purse—to know\r\n    What grief was his, and what to grief we owe;\r\n    To see him often, always to conceive\r\n    How he must pine and languish, groan and grieve;[4]\r\n    And every day in ease and peace to dine,\r\n    And rest in comfort!—what a heart is mine!”\r\n\r\nRichard Savage, as Mr. Whitehead pictures him, bitterly conversant with\r\ncold and hunger, a houseless vagrant through the streets by night, and a\r\nfamishing lounger in them by day, apostrophises Mr. Overseer in his pursy\r\nprosperity, much as (_mutatis mutandis_) Lear apostrophises pomp. “Turn\r\nout, fat man of substance, and bob for wisdom and charity on the banks\r\nof Southwark. They are best taken at night, when God only sees you—when\r\nthe east wind is abroad, making you shake like the sinner who was hanged\r\nfor breaking into your dwelling-house. ‘The air bites shrewdly, it is\r\nvery cold,’ sayest thou? It is so. But tell me whether, on the fourth\r\nnight, when thou liest stretched on thy blessed bed, thy heart is not\r\nwarmer than it was wont to be—whether thou dost not pray prayers of long\r\nomission—whether thou wilt not, in the morning, bethink thee of the poor,\r\nand relieve them out of thy abundance? Sayest thou, no? God help thee!”\r\nAs Van den Bosch tells the big-wigs of Ghent,\r\n\r\n    “Ah, sirs, you know not, you, who lies afield\r\n    When nights are cold, with frogs for bedfellows;\r\n    You know not, you, who fights and sheds his blood,\r\n    And fasts and fills his belly with the east wind.”\r\n\r\nDiderot rose one Shrove Tuesday morning, and groping in his pocket, found\r\nnothing wherewith to dine that day—which he spent in wandering about\r\nParis and its precincts. He was ill when he got back to his quarters,\r\nwent to bed, and was treated by his landlady to a little toast and wine.\r\n“That day,” he often told a friend, in after life, “I swore that, if\r\never I came to have anything, I would never in my life refuse a poor\r\nman help, never condemn my fellow-creature to a day as painful.” As the\r\nsailor says, after the wreck, in one of Mr. Roscoe’s tragedies: “We may\r\nbe wrecked a dozen times, for what our betters care; but being aboard\r\nthemselves, they see some spice of danger in it, and that breeds a\r\nfellow-feeling.” And, proverbially, a fellow-feeling makes us wondrous\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nMr. Ruskin demands whether, even supposing it guiltless, luxury would\r\nbe desired by any of us, if we saw clearly at our sides the suffering\r\nwhich accompanies it in the world. “Luxury is indeed possible in the\r\nfuture—innocent and exquisite; luxury for all, and by the help of all;\r\nbut luxury at present can only be enjoyed by the ignorant; the cruelest\r\nman living could not sit at his feast, unless he sat blindfold.”\r\n\r\nGibbon records to the honour of at least one Pontiff’s temporal\r\ngovernment of Rome, that he—Gregory the Great—relieved by the bounty\r\nof each day, and of every hour, the instant distress of the sick and\r\nneedy—his treasurers being continually summoned to satisfy, in his\r\nname, the requirements of indigence and merit. “Nor would the pontiff\r\nindulge himself in a frugal repast, till he had sent the dishes from\r\nhis own table to some objects deserving of his compassion.” A _non\r\npossumus_ this, in its beneficent _nisi prius_ scope, more appreciable\r\nby Protestants at least than that of some other Holy Fathers. A\r\nsovran’s interest in the sufferings of his or her subjects is always of\r\nexceptional interest in the eyes of fellow-subjects. Leigh Hunt knew\r\nthis, when he pictured, in her early happy wifehood, our Sovran Lady the\r\nQueen of these realms,\r\n\r\n      “Too generous-happy to endure\r\n    The thought of all the woful poor\r\n    Who that same night lay down their heads\r\n    In mockeries of starving beds,\r\n    In cold, in wet, disease, despair,\r\n    In madness that will say no prayer;\r\n    With wailing infants some; and some\r\n    By whom the little clay lies dumb;\r\n    And some, whom feeble love’s excess,\r\n    Through terror, tempts to murderousness.\r\n    And at that thought the big drops rose\r\n    In pity for her people’s woes;\r\n    And this glad mother and great queen\r\n    Weeping for the poor was seen,\r\n    And vowing in her princely will\r\n    That they should thrive and bless her still.”\r\n\r\nMadame de Chevreuse, in a popular French romance, is made to say to,\r\nand _at_, Anne of Austria, that kings are so far removed from other\r\npeople, from the “vulgar herd,” that they forget that others ever stand\r\nin need of the bare necessaries of life. She likens them to the dweller\r\non African mountains, who, gazing from the verdant table-land, refreshed\r\nby the rills of melted snow, cannot comprehend that the dwellers in\r\nthe plains below him are perishing from hunger and thirst in the midst\r\nof their lands, burnt up by the heat of the sun. When, in the same\r\nromance—by courtesy historical; only the proportion of history to romance\r\nin it is much about that of Falstaff’s bread bill to his running account\r\nfor sack—one of Anne of Austria’s sons, the reigning king, young Lewis\r\nthe Fourteenth, is substituted in the Bastille for his ill-starred\r\nbrother, and so comes to taste of suffering _in propriâ personâ_,—the\r\nroyal prisoner tries to remember at what hour the first repast is served\r\nto the captives in that fortress—but his ignorance of this detail\r\noccasions a feeling of remorse that smites him like the keen thrust of a\r\ndagger: “that he should have lived for five and twenty years a king, and\r\nin the enjoyment of every happiness, without having bestowed a moment’s\r\nthought\r\n\r\n    [O, I have ta’en too little thought of this!]\r\n\r\non the misery of those who had been unjustly deprived of their liberty.\r\nThe king blushed for very shame. He felt that Heaven, in permitting this\r\nfearful humiliation, did no more than render to the man the same torture\r\nas was inflicted by that man upon so many others.”—It is in a glowing\r\ndescription of one of the great fêtes at Versailles under the auspices\r\nof this, the Grand Monarque, that M. Arsène Houssaye delivers himself\r\nof this pensive aside: “Et la musique de Lulli achève d’enivrer tout ce\r\nbeau monde, qui ne pense pas un seul instant que près de là, à la grille\r\nmême du château des merveilles, une pauvre femme prie et pleure, tout\r\naffamée, pour ses enfants. Qu’importe! passe ton chemin, et reviens plus\r\ntard. Comment t’appelles-tu, bonne femme?—Je m’appelle la France: _je\r\nreviendrai_.”\r\n\r\nPart of the education of the royal heir-apparent of the Incas consisted\r\nin a course of gymnastic training, with competitive trials of\r\nskill—during which, for a period of thirty days, “the royal neophyte\r\nfared no better than his comrades, sleeping on the bare ground, going\r\nunshod, and wearing a mean attire,—a mode of life, it was supposed, which\r\nmight tend to inspire him with more sympathy with the destitute.” It is\r\nto royalty that Jeanie Deans is pleading, when she exclaims, “Alas! it is\r\nnot when we sleep soft and wake merrily ourselves, that we think on other\r\npeople’s sufferings. Our hearts are waxed light within us then.... But\r\nwhen the hour of trouble comes—and seldom may it visit your leddyship—and\r\nwhen the hour of death comes, that comes to high and low—lang and late\r\nmay it be yours—O my leddy, then it isna what we hae dune for oursells,\r\nbut what we hae dune for others, that we think on maist pleasantly.”\r\nAn English traveller in Russia, discussing the difficulty with which\r\nnews of starving peasants reaches the ears of the czar, and tracing\r\nthe roundabout track by which, at last, when many have died, and\r\nmany more are dying, a stifled wail penetrates through the “official\r\ncotton-stuffed ears of district police auditoria, district chambers\r\nof domains, military chiefs of governments, and imperial chancelleries\r\nwithout number,” and comes soughing into the private cabinet of the\r\nczar at the Winter Palace or Peterhoff,—goes on to say: “The empress,\r\ngood soul, sheds tears when she hears of the dreadful sufferings of the\r\npoor people so many hundred versts off. The imperial children, I have\r\nno doubt, wonder why, if the peasants have no bread to eat, they don’t\r\ntake to plum-cake; the Emperor is affected, but goes to work,” etc.\r\nWhich last expression, by the way, reminds us of a _quasi_ quotation by\r\nMr. Carlyle of Shakespeare’s text in juxtaposition with mention of the\r\ngreatest of czars: “Descend, O Donothing Pomp; quit thy down-cushions;\r\nexpose thyself to learn what wretches feel, and how to cure it! The\r\nczar of Russia became a dusty toiling shipwright; ... and his aim was\r\nsmall to thine.” There was a miserable day in the Highland wanderings of\r\nPrince Charles when, with Ned Burke and Donald Macleod for companions,\r\nafter roving about all night, excessively faint for want of food, he was\r\nobliged to subsist on meal stirred in brine—there being no fresh water\r\nwithin reach. The prince is said to have expressed himself thankful for\r\neven this nauseous food—“salt-water drammock”—and to have declared, on\r\nthe occasion, that if ever he mounted a throne, he should not fail to\r\nremember “those who dined with him to-day.” When Flora Macdonald and\r\nLady Clanranald, not long afterwards, came to the royal outcast,—on\r\nentering the hut they found him engaged in roasting the heart and liver\r\nof a sheep on a wooden spit; a sight at which some of the party could\r\nnot help shedding tears. “Charles, always the least concerned at his\r\ndistressing circumstances, though never forgetting the hopes inspired by\r\nhis birth, jocularly observed that it would be well perhaps for all kings\r\nif they had to come through such a fiery ordeal as he was enduring.” At a\r\nsubsequent period we find him living for days together on a few handfuls\r\nof oatmeal and about a pound of butter—referring to which he afterwards\r\ntold a Highland gentleman that he had come to know what a quarter of a\r\npeck of meal was, having once subsisted on such a quantity for the better\r\npart of a week. Another time we find him spending the night in an open\r\ncave, on the top of a high hill between the Braes of Glenmorriston and\r\nStrathglass,—a cave too narrow to let him stretch himself, and in which\r\nhe lay drenched to the skin, with no possibility of getting a fire to dry\r\nhim. “Without food, and deprived of sleep by the narrowness and hardness\r\nof his bed, the only comfort he could obtain was the miserable one of\r\nsmoking a pipe.” Hardly was Lear himself more thoroughly exposed to feel\r\nwhat wretches feel, on that night beside the hovel on the heath.\r\n\r\nIn that paradoxical essay of his, on saying grace before meat, Charles\r\nLamb remarks that the indigent man, who hardly knows whether he shall\r\nhave a meal the next day or not, sits down to his fare with a present\r\nsense of the blessing, which can be but feebly acted by the rich, into\r\nwhose minds the conception of wanting a dinner could never, but by some\r\nextreme theory, have entered. According to the essayist, the heats\r\nof epicurism put out the gentle flame of devotion: the incense which\r\nrises round is pagan, and the belly-god intercepts it for his own. “The\r\nvery excess of the provision beyond the needs, takes away all sense of\r\nproportion between the end and means. The Giver is veiled by his gifts.\r\nYou are startled at the injustice of returning thanks—for what?—for\r\nhaving so much, while so many starve. It is to praise the gods amiss.”\r\n\r\nTaking for his text the apprenticeship of good Abbot Samson at St.\r\nEdmund’s shrine, Mr. Carlyle moralises on how much would many a Serene\r\nHighness have learnt, had he travelled through the world with water-jug\r\nand empty wallet, _sine omni expensâ_, and returned only to sit down\r\nat the foot of St. Edmund’s shrine to shackles and bread and water.\r\nPatriotism itself, a political economist has remarked, can never be\r\ngenerated by a passive enjoyment of good; the evil tendency of which\r\nhe bids us see by merely looking to a city like London; where the rich\r\nwho live together in streets of fine houses many miles long, and have\r\nevery comfort provided for them without their interference, and need\r\nnothing from the poor but what they buy for money, and conclude that the\r\nsame State which cares for them will care equally for the poor,—such\r\nrich men, it is alleged, have every inducement to become isolated from\r\nall but the few with whom it is pleasant to live. We may choose, says\r\nProfessor Kingsley, to look at the masses in the gross as subjects for\r\nstatistics—and of course, where possible, for profits. “There is One\r\nabove who knows every thirst, and ache, and sorrow, and temptation of\r\neach slattern, and gin-drinker, and street boy. The day will come when\r\nHe will require an account of these neglects of ours—not in the gross.”\r\nMrs. Gaskell ably describes the fear of Margaret Hale, in “North and\r\nSouth,” lest, in her West-end ease, she should become sleepily deadened\r\ninto forgetfulness of anything beyond the life that was lapping her round\r\nwith luxury. “There might be toilers and moilers there in London, but\r\nshe never saw them; the very servants lived in an underground world of\r\ntheir own, of which she knew neither the hopes nor the fears; they only\r\nseemed to start into existence when some want or whim of their master\r\nand mistress needed them.” Mr. Thackeray presents Ethel Newcome in the\r\nfairest light when he shows her studious to become acquainted with her\r\nindigent neighbours—giving much time to them and thought; visiting from\r\nhouse to house without ostentation; awe-stricken by that spectacle\r\nof poverty which we have with us always, of which the sight rebukes\r\nour selfish griefs into silence, the thought compels us to charity,\r\nhumility, and devotion. “Death never dying out; hunger always crying;\r\nand children born to it day after day,—our young London lady, flying\r\nfrom the splendours and follies in which her life had been passed, found\r\nherself in the presence of these; threading darkling alleys which swarmed\r\nwith wretched life; sitting by naked beds, whither by God’s blessing\r\nshe was sometimes enabled to carry a little comfort and consolation; or\r\nwhence she came heart-stricken by the overpowering misery, or touched by\r\nthe patient resignation, of the new friends to whom fate had directed\r\nher.” No longer _ignara mali, miseris succurrere discit_. An essayist of\r\nMr. Thackeray’s school, on the topic of parliamentary trains, breaks\r\nout, or off, into the apostrophe: “Ah, judges of Amontillado sherry;\r\ncrushers of walnuts with silver crackers; connoisseurs who prefer French\r\nto Spanish olives, and are curious about the yellow seal; gay riders in\r\npadded chariots; proud cavaliers of blood-horses,—you don’t know how\r\npainfully and slowly, almost agonisingly, the poor have to scrape and\r\nsave, and deny themselves the necessaries of life, to gather together\r\nthe penny-a-mile fare.” Lord Jeffrey eagerly asserted the even painful\r\ninterest with which one of Mr. Dickens’s Christmas books affected him:\r\n“sanative, I dare say, to the spirit, but making us despise and loathe\r\nourselves for passing our days in luxury, while better and gentler\r\ncreatures are living such lives as make us wonder that such things can be\r\nin a society of human beings, or even in the world of a good God.” Lord\r\nLytton has compared the stray glimpses one gets of want and misery, to\r\nlooking through a solar microscope at the monsters in a drop of water,\r\nwhen the gazer wonders how things so terrible have hitherto been unknown\r\nto him: “Lapped in your sleek comforts, and lolling on the sofa of your\r\npatent conscience ... you are startled and dismayed” at the sight:\r\nyou say within yourself, “Can such things be? I never dreamed of this\r\nbefore! I thought what was invisible to me was non-existent in itself—I\r\nwill remember this dread experiment.” The like is the moral of Hood’s\r\npoem of the Lady’s Dream. From grief exempt, she had never dreamt of\r\nsuch a world of woe as appals her in apocalyptic visions of the night;\r\nnever dreamt till now of the hearts that daily break, and the tears that\r\nhourly fall, and the many, many troubles of life that grieve this earthly\r\nball—disease, and hunger, and pain, and want; but now she dreams of them\r\nall—of the naked she might have clad, the famished she might have fed,\r\nthe sorrowing she might have solaced; of each pleading that, long ago,\r\nshe scanned with a heedless eye.\r\n\r\n    “I drank the richest draughts;\r\n      And ate whatever is good—\r\n    Fish, and flesh, and fowl, and fruit\r\n      Supplied my hungry mood;\r\n    But I never remembered the wretched ones\r\n      That starve for want of food.\r\n\r\n    I dressed as the noble dress,\r\n      In cloth of silver and gold,\r\n    With silk, and satin, and costly furs,\r\n      In many an ample fold;\r\n    But I never remembered the naked limbs\r\n      That froze with winter’s cold.\r\n\r\n    The wounds I might have healed!\r\n      The human sorrow and smart!\r\n    And yet it never was in my soul\r\n      To play so ill a part\r\n    But evil is wrought by want of Thought\r\n\r\n[So Lear’s “O, I have ta’en _too little thought_ of this!”]\r\n\r\n      As well as want of Heart!\r\n\r\n    She clasped her fervent hands,\r\n      And the tears began to stream;\r\n    Large, and bitter, and fast they fell,\r\n      Remorse was so extreme,\r\n    And yet, O yet, that many a dame\r\n      Would dream the Lady’s Dream!”\r\n\r\nAn _Edinburgh_ Reviewer of mortality in trades and professions, dwelling\r\non the fatal conditions under which very many classes earn their daily\r\nbread, and sometimes not so much as that,—observes that the great middle\r\nand upper classes, accustomed to be furnished with all the appliances of\r\neasy life and luxury, seldom give a thought as to the manner in which\r\ntheir wants are supplied. “Accustomed to sip the honey, it never strikes\r\nus that perhaps its product involves in some cases the life of the\r\nworking-bee. The lady, who, from the silken ease of her fauteuil, surveys\r\nher drawing-room, may learn a lesson of compassion for the poor workmen\r\nin nearly every article that lies before her.” To take one example out\r\nof the many upon which Dr. Wynter dilates—the case of the silverer of\r\nlooking-glasses: “If the charming belle, as she surveys her beauty in the\r\nglass, could but for a moment see reflected this poor shattered human\r\ncreature, with trembling muscles, brown visage, and blackened teeth, she\r\nwould doubtless start with horror; but, as it is, the slaves of luxury\r\nand vanity drop out of life unobserved and uncared for, as the stream of\r\ntravellers disappeared one by one through the bridge of Mirza.”\r\n\r\n    “O let those cities that of plenty’s cup,\r\n    And her prosperities, so largely taste,\r\n    With their superfluous riots, hear these tears!\r\n    The misery of Tharsus may be theirs.”\r\n\r\nThe moral of the eastern tale of Nourjahad is practical and pertinent. He\r\ndelivers himself up to luxury and riot. He forgets that there are wants\r\nand distresses among his fellow-creatures. He lives only for himself,\r\nand his heart becomes as hard as the coffers which hold his misapplied\r\ntreasures. But before it is too late he is awakened to remorse, and looks\r\nback with shame and horror on his past life. What shall he do to expiate\r\nhis offences? One thing at least is within his power, and that will he do\r\nat once: expend his riches in the relief of want—nor rest until he has\r\nfound out every family in Ormuz whom calamity has overtaken, that he may\r\nrestore them to prosperity. Henceforth he spends his days in his closet,\r\nlaying plans for the benefit of his fellow-creatures. Ben Jonson’s\r\nSordido promises the like amendment:—\r\n\r\n    “Pardon me, gentle friends, I’ll make fair ’mends\r\n    For my foul errors past....\r\n    My barns and garners shall stand open still\r\n    To all the poor that come, and my best grain\r\n    Be made alms-bread, to feed half-famished mouths.\r\n    Though hitherto amongst you I have lived\r\n    Like an unsavoury muck-hill to myself,\r\n    Yet now my gathered heaps, being spread abroad,\r\n    Shall turn to better and more fruitful uses.\r\n                      ... O how deeply\r\n    The bitter curses of the poor do pierce!\r\n    I am by wonder changed; come in with me\r\n    And witness my repentance: now I prove\r\n    No life is blest that is not graced with love.”\r\n\r\nSo again with the rich man in one of Crabbe’s Borough sketches from life;\r\nthat rich man, to wit, who\r\n\r\n          “built a house, both large and high,\r\n    And entered in and set him down to sigh;\r\n    And planted ample woods and gardens fair,\r\n    And walked with anguish and compunction there;\r\n    The rich man’s pines to every friend a treat,\r\n    _He_ saw with pain and _he_ refused to eat;\r\n    His daintiest food, his richest wines, were all\r\n    Turned by remorse to vinegar and gall:\r\n    The softest down by living body pressed\r\n    The rich man bought, and tried to take his rest;\r\n    But care had thorns upon his pillow spread,\r\n    And scattered sand and nettles in his bed:\r\n    Nervous he grew—would often sigh and groan,—\r\n    He talked but little, and he walked alone;\r\n    Till by his priest convinced, that from one deed\r\n    Of genuine love would joy and health proceed,\r\n    He from that time with care and zeal began\r\n    To seek and soothe the grievous ills of man;\r\n    And as his hands their aid to grief apply,\r\n    He learns to smile and he forgets to sigh.\r\n    Now he can drink his wine and taste his food,\r\n    And feel the blessings Heaven has dealt are good;\r\n    And since the suffering seek the rich man’s door,\r\n    He sleeps as soundly as when young and poor.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_WIND, EARTHQUAKE, FIRE, AND STILL SMALL VOICE._\r\n\r\n1 KINGS xix. 11, 12.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Elijah stood upon the mount before the Lord, there arose a great\r\nand strong wind that rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks;\r\nbut the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but\r\nthe Lord was not in the earthquake: and after the earthquake a fire; but\r\nthe Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.\r\nWe are not told that the Lord was not in the still small voice. We find\r\nthat He was. And with that voice He addressed Elijah, reasoned with him,\r\nadmonished, sustained, and directed him. May it not be said, in applying\r\nand adapting the narrative, which things are an allegory? The import of\r\nthe narrative sublimely anticipates the homely fable of sun and wind.\r\nWind, earthquake, and fire, are mighty agents; but they may pass by\r\nwithout tangible result as regards real influence on the spirit of man;\r\nwhereas the gentle influence of a still small voice speaks home to it at\r\nonce, and it responds to the strain, and is subdued by the spell.\r\n\r\nThe drift of the present annotations, in their applied sense, finds\r\nexpression in Ben Jonson’s reminder:\r\n\r\n                          “There is\r\n    A way of working more by love than fear:\r\n    Fear works on servile natures, not the free.”\r\n\r\nIn Landor’s Parable of Asabel, the angel’s gentleness wrought upon that\r\nturbulent, refractory spirit, “even as the quiet and silent water wins\r\nitself an entrance where tempest and fire pass over.” It is written that\r\nother angels did look up with loving and admiration into the visage\r\nof this angel on his return; and he told the younger and more zealous\r\nof them, that whenever they would descend into the gloomy vortex of\r\nthe human heart, under the softness and serenity of their voice and\r\ncountenance its turbulence would subside.\r\n\r\nPlutarch tells us of Fabius Maximus, that he thought it hard that, while\r\nthose who breed dogs and horses soften their stubborn tempers, and bring\r\ndown their fierce spirits by care and kindness, rather than with whips\r\nand chains, he who has the command of men should not endeavour to correct\r\ntheir errors by gentleness and goodness, but treat them in even a harsher\r\nand more violent manner than gardeners do the wild fig-trees, pears, and\r\nolives, whose nature they subdue by cultivation, and which by that means\r\nthey bring to produce very agreeable fruit.[5]\r\n\r\nWe read of the distinguished Spanish author and statesman, Fermin\r\nCaballero, that while under the care of a kind and judicious instructor,\r\nhe, as a boy, made rapid advance in the study of classical literature;\r\nbut that on being removed from this tutor, and subjected to harsh and\r\ngrinding discipline, he lapsed into idleness and obstinacy beyond all\r\ncontrol. Not the least wise of the maxims to be culled from the pages\r\nof Terence is that in which _satius esse credit Pudore et liberalitate\r\nliberos retinere, quam metu_. Southey insists that no man was ever more\r\nthoroughly ignorant of the nature of children than John Wesley, as when\r\nhe enjoins: “Let a child from a year old be taught to fear the rod, and\r\nto cry softly; from that age make him do as he is bid, if you whip him\r\nten times running to effect it.” If Wesley had been a father himself,\r\nurges that tenderest of fathers, Robert the Rhymer, “he would have known\r\nthat children are more easily governed by love than by fear.” And as\r\nwith children, so with men, who are but children of a larger growth; and\r\nespecially so with women, if we may take the word of one of Shakspeare’s\r\nmost winsome women for it:\r\n\r\n                      “You may ride us\r\n    With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs, ere\r\n    With spur we heat an acre.”\r\n\r\nSo with Landor’s Filippa, on whom harsh treatment and compulsory measures\r\nare simply thrown away:\r\n\r\n    “Rudeness can neither move nor discompose her:\r\n    A word, a look, of kindness, instantly\r\n    Opens her heart and brings her cheek upon you.”\r\n\r\nAnd as with men and women, so with peoples, who are made up of men and\r\nwomen. And yet, although, as the author of the “Wealth of Nations”\r\nexpresses it, management and persuasion are always the easiest and safest\r\ninstruments of government, as force and violence are the worst and most\r\ndangerous; such, it seems, is the natural insolence of man, that he\r\nalmost always disdains to use the good instrument, except when he cannot\r\nor dare not use the bad one. Not that nations are without diversities\r\nof character, and so of susceptibility to diverse modes of government.\r\nGibbon apologises, as it were, for Diocletian’s utter destruction of\r\nthose proud cities, Busiris and Coptos, and for his severe treatment\r\nof Egypt in general, by the remark, that the character of the Egyptian\r\nnation, insensible to kindness, but extremely susceptible to fear, could\r\nalone justify this excessive rigour. The tone is that of the courtier\r\nCrispe, to Phocas, in Corneille’s “Heraclius:”\r\n\r\n    “Il faut agir de force avec de tels esprits ...\r\n    La violence est juste où la douceur est vaine.”\r\n\r\nAnd Coke maintains that if they are the best whom love induces, they are\r\nthe most whom fear restrains: _Si meliores sunt quos ducit amor, plures\r\nsunt quos corrigit timor_. La Fontaine’s fable of the fishes and the\r\nflute-playing shepherd, intimates the sheer futility of wasting sweet\r\nsounds on ears not to be so caught. There are men, sententiously quoth\r\nDr. Tempest, in the “Last Chronicle of Barset,” who are deaf as adders to\r\ncourtesy, but who are compelled to obedience at once by ill-usage.\r\n\r\nEducationists must provide for the contingency of having to deal with\r\nabnormal natures of this crabbed and distorted kind. But as exceptions\r\nonly. The Jesuits are confessedly masters of the arts of education; and\r\nthe rule of the Jesuits is to lead not to drive, their pupils; to allure\r\nand win, not to coerce and constrain them. Winsome womankind is mistress\r\nof the like arts. Those of the sex who _are_ winsome, it has been\r\nsaid, with their plastic manners and non-aggressive force, always have\r\ntheir own way in the end. “They coax and flatter for their rights, and\r\nconsequently they are given privileges in excess of their rights; whereas\r\nthe women who take their rights, as things to which they are entitled\r\nwithout favour, lose them and their privileges together.” Kitely’s advice\r\nis good, in “Every Man in his Humour,” and of general application:\r\n\r\n    “But rather use the soft persuading way,\r\n    Whose powers will work more gently, and compose\r\n    The imperfect thoughts you labour to reclaim;\r\n    More winning, than enforcing the consent.”\r\n\r\nThe first bishop sent from Iona for the Northumbrian Church was Corman,\r\na man described by Dean Milman as of austere and inflexible character,\r\nwho, finding more resistance than he expected to his doctrines, in a full\r\nassembly of the nation sternly reproached the Northumbrians for their\r\nobstinacy, and declared that he would no longer waste his labours on so\r\nirreclaimable a race. A gentle voice was heard: “Brother, have you not\r\nbeen too harsh with your unlearned hearers? Should you not, like the\r\napostles, have fed them with the milk of Christian doctrine, till they\r\ncould receive the full feast of our sublimer truths?” All eyes, it is\r\nadded, were turned on Aidan, a humble but devout monk; and by general\r\nacclamation that discreet and gentle teacher was saluted as bishop. The\r\nsame historian describes Aldhelm of Malmesbury, in minstrel’s garb,\r\narresting the careless crowd of church-goers on a bridge they must pass,\r\nand having fully enthralled their attention by the sweetness of his\r\nsong, anon introducing into it some of the solemn truths of religion;\r\nthus succeeding in winning to the faith many hearts, which he would have\r\nattempted in vain to move by severer language, or even by the awful\r\nexcommunication of the Church.[6] When Fénélon was intrusted by Lewis\r\nthe Fourteenth with a mission to Poitou, to convert the Protestants,\r\nhe refused the aid of dragoons, and resorted to suavity of persuasion\r\nalone as an instrument of conversion. Of the Protestant missions in the\r\nwest of Ireland, complaint has been made of their being conducted too\r\noffensively, like raids upon heathendom: the Romanist, who might possibly\r\nopen his bosom to the warm rays of charity, only folds the cloak of his\r\nhereditary faith more closely round him, when assailed by the bitter\r\nwind of a propagandism which seeks its way to the heart by violence and\r\ninsult.[7]\r\n\r\nIt is at once, on the one part pleasant, on the other painful, to find\r\nthe Lord Treasurer Burleigh, who had ever been the fast friend of\r\nWhitgift, frequently expressing his disapprobation of the primate’s\r\nseverity against non-conformists, and his wish “that the spirit\r\nof gentleness might win, rather than severity.” And being here on\r\nElizabethan ground, let us note Mr. Froude’s reference to the diverse\r\nprocedure of Cecil and Throgmorton in their several dealings with the\r\nqueen,—she being one of the many strong-willed people, on whom menaces\r\nand reproaches operate only as a spur. Cecil understood best Elizabeth’s\r\ndisposition. “By ‘practices,’ by ‘bye-ways,’ as he afterwards described\r\nit, by affecting to humour what he was passionately anxious to prevent,\r\nhe was holding his mistress under delicate control; and he dreaded\r\nlest his light leading-strings should be broken by a ruder touch.” As\r\nwith the queen, so with her people. When Catherine de Medici expressed\r\nastonishment to Sir Thomas Smith, at a certain deference paid by his\r\nsovereign to the nation she ruled, “Madam,” he replied, “her people be\r\nnot like your people; they must be trained by _douceur_ and persuasion,\r\nnot by rigour and violence.” The greatest of Russian empresses emulated\r\nin this respect the greatest of English queens. Indeed, her tendency\r\nto indulgence was imputed to Catharine II. as a fault, advantage being\r\ntaken of her constant reluctance to punish. But how far greater things\r\ndid she, on the whole, achieve with her subjects, exclaims Mr. Herman\r\nMerivale, “thus gently led, than those of her predecessors and successors\r\nwho employed on them in such abundance the more forcible methods of\r\ngovernment!”\r\n\r\nMr. Freeman, in the course of showing that Harold’s way of bringing in\r\nthe proud Danes of the North to his obedience was not exactly the same as\r\nWilliam’s way, describes him as determining, with that noble and generous\r\ndaring which is sometimes the highest prudence, to trust himself in the\r\nhands of the people who refused to acknowledge him. “These his enemies,\r\nwho would not that he should reign over them, instead of being brought\r\nand slain before him, were to be won over by the magic of his personal\r\npresence in their own land.” To apply what the Gaulish ambassador says of\r\na great Roman in Jonson’s tragedy,\r\n\r\n    “This magistrate hath struck an awe into me,\r\n    And by his sweetness won a more regard\r\n    Unto his place, than all the boisterous moods\r\n    That ignorant greatness practiseth, to fill\r\n    The large, unfit authority it wears.”\r\n\r\nThe Antwerp authorities had reason and experience on their side when they\r\nsought to persuade the Prince of Parma, in 1585, that the hearts of, not\r\nthe Antwerpers only, but of the Hollanders and Zealanders, were easily\r\nto be won at that moment: give them religious liberty, and “govern them\r\nby gentleness rather than by Spanish grandees,” and a reconciliation\r\nwould speedily be ensured. Two years later, but then two years too\r\nlate, we find the prince averring that he liked “to proceed rather by\r\nthe ways of love than of rigour and effusion of blood.” This was in\r\nanswer to Queen Elizabeth, who, at a previous juncture, angrily derided\r\nany “slight and mild kind of dealing with a people so ingrate,” and\r\nwas all for corrosives instead of lenitives for such festering wounds.\r\nRulers, who fail to secure what they wish by gentle means, are apt very\r\nsoon to resort to the less excellent way; like Chilperic, the “Nero of\r\nFrance,” coaxing the Jew Priscus to turn Christian; first employing\r\nargument, then trying blandishments, and anon taking to more powerful\r\nreasoning by throwing the Jew into prison. Tytler remarks of the “violent\r\ninstructions” enforced by Henry VIII. on his envoy to James V., that had\r\nthe overbearing Tudor adopted a suaver tone, a favourable impression\r\nmight have been made; but the King o’ Scots was “not to be threatened\r\ninto a compliance with a line of policy which, if suggested in a tone of\r\nconciliation, his judgment might have approved,” and his unwounded sense\r\nof self-respect have consented to carry into effect.\r\n\r\nSimon the glover, in Scott’s story of mediæval Perth, is well described\r\nas watchful over the tactics his daughter employs towards Henry Smith,\r\n“whom he knew to be as ductile, when influenced by his affections, as\r\nhe was fierce and intractable when assailed by hostile remonstrances\r\nor threats.” _Par un chemin plus doux_, says a shrewd counsellor in\r\nRacine, _vous pourrez le ramener_; whereas _les menaces le rendront plus\r\nfarouche_. Archbishop Whately deprecates the bullying and browbeating\r\nsystem in vogue with certain barristers, and declares it to be a mistake\r\nas a means of eliciting truth: he cites his own observation of the\r\nmarked success of the opposite mode of questioning, and maintains that,\r\ngenerally speaking, a quiet, gentle, and straightforward examination\r\nwill be the most adapted to elicit truth; the browbeating and blustering\r\nwhich are likeliest to confuse an honest, simple-minded witness, being\r\njust what the dishonest one is the best prepared for. “The more the storm\r\nblusters, the more carefully he wraps round him the cloak which a warm\r\nsunshine will often induce him to throw off.”\r\n\r\nWe are told of Dr. Beattie, in his relations as a professor with his\r\nclass, that his sway was absolute, because it was founded in reason\r\nand affection; that he never employed a harsh epithet in finding fault\r\nwith any of his pupils; and that when, instead of a rebuke, which they\r\nwere conscious they deserved, they met merely with a mild reproof, it\r\nwas conveyed in such a manner as to throw, not only the delinquent, but\r\nsometimes the whole class into tears. Fielding’s boy-hero is at once in\r\ntears when the kind squire takes him in hand, instead of the harsh tutor;\r\nhis “guilt now flew in his face more than any severity could make it.\r\nHe could more easily bear the lashes of Thwackum than the generosity of\r\nAllworthy.” Mrs. Fry used to bear eager record of the docility she had\r\nfound, and the gratitude she had experienced, from female prisoners,\r\nthough the most abandoned of their sex: kind treatment, even with\r\nrestraint obviously for their good, was so new to them, that it called\r\nforth, as Sir Samuel Romilly says, “even in the most depraved, grateful\r\nand generous feelings.” True to the life is the picture Mr. Reade has\r\ndrawn of the effect on the actress, of a young wife coming to her as a\r\nsupplicant, instead of inveighing against her,—coming with faith in her\r\ngoodness, and sobbing to her for pity: “a big tear rolled down her cheek,\r\nand proved her something more than an actress.” In another of his books\r\nhe illustrates the truth that men can resist the remonstrances that wound\r\nthem, and so irritate them, better than they can those gentle appeals\r\nwhich rouse no anger, but soften the whole heart. “The old people stung\r\nhim; but Mercy, without design, took a surer way. She never said a word;\r\nbut sometimes, when the discussions were at their height, she turned\r\nher dove-like eyes on him, with a look so loving, so humbly inquiring,\r\nso timidly imploring, that his heart melted within him.” So with Janet\r\nDempster, in George Eliot’s story of clerical life, who “was not to\r\nbe made meek by cruelty; she would repent of nothing in the face of\r\ninjustice, though she was subdued in a moment by a word or a look that\r\nrecalled the old days of fondness.” In fine, we may conclude with the\r\nconclusion of old Master Knowell, in the Elizabethan play:\r\n\r\n    “There is a way of winning more by love,\r\n    And urging of the modesty, than fear:\r\n    Force works on servile natures, not the free.\r\n    He that’s compelled to goodness, may be good,\r\n    But ’tis but for that fit; where others, drawn\r\n    By softness and example, get a habit.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_HAMAN HANGED ON HIS OWN GALLOWS._\r\n\r\nESTHER vii. 10\r\n\r\n\r\nHarbonah was one of the chamberlains of that king Ahasuerus, who reigned\r\nfrom India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven and twenty\r\nprovinces. And Harbonah it was that said before the king,—when Haman, the\r\nson of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews’ enemy, had gone one step too far\r\nin his enmity to the Jews, and had let his vaulting ambition overleap\r\nitself in his insolent confidence in royal favour,—Harbonah it was that\r\nprompted royal vengeance with the suggestive reminder,—“Behold also, the\r\ngallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had\r\nspoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman.” Then the king\r\nsaid—catching at once at the chamberlain’s suggestion—“Hang him thereon.”\r\n“So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai.”\r\n\r\nSomewhat musty is the adage that no law is more equitable than that by\r\nwhich the deviser of death perishes by his own device: _nec lex est\r\næquior ulla, quam necis artificem arte perire suâ_. Musty it might be\r\neven in Harbonah’s days; but the chamberlain, in the excitement of so\r\nsignal an example, would feel that time cannot stale, nor custom wither,\r\nthe force and import of that retributive law.\r\n\r\nMr. de Quincey, in his memorable narrative of the revolt of the Tartars,\r\nor flight of the Kalmuck Khan and his people from the Russian territories\r\nto the frontiers of China (1771), relates in conclusion how Zebek-Dorchi,\r\nthe author and originator of this great Tartar _exodus_, perished after a\r\nmanner specially gratifying to those who compassed his ruin; the Chinese\r\nmorality being exactly of that kind which approves in everything the _lex\r\ntalionis_. “Finally, Zebek-Dorchi was invited to the imperial lodge,\r\ntogether with all his accomplices; and under the skilful management\r\nof the Chinese nobles in the emperor’s establishment, the murderous\r\nartifices of these Tartar chieftains were made to recoil upon themselves,\r\nand the whole of them perished by assassination at a great imperial\r\nbanquet.” Iterated and reiterated in holy writ is the retributive law\r\nthat the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness; that transgressors\r\nshall be taken in their own naughtiness; that he that seeketh mischief it\r\nshall come unto him. The presidents and princes under King Darius, who\r\nsought occasion against Daniel, and persuaded their reluctant sovereign\r\nto cast the prophet into the den of lions, who however wrought him no\r\nmanner of hurt,—upon _them_ the _lex talionis_ vindicated its literal\r\nseverity when they in their turn were cast into the lions’ den, and the\r\nlions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or\r\never they came at the bottom of the den.\r\n\r\nThe early ballads of almost every literature delight in these retributive\r\nsurprises. Genuine was the zest of our fathers for such a retort as that\r\nof William of Cloudesly on the Justice who is having him measured for his\r\ngrave:—\r\n\r\n    “‘I have seen as great a marvel,’ said Cloudesly,\r\n      ‘As between this and prime\r\n    He that maketh a grave for me\r\n      Himself may lie therein.’”\r\n\r\nSo fond is popular history of teaching this sort of philosophy by\r\nexamples, that examples to the purpose are widely accepted which are\r\nyet not historical. Cardinal Balue, under Louis XI., is pointed out\r\nin his iron cage, as a malignant inventor punished in and through his\r\nown invention; but Michelet has exposed the fallacy of supposing Balue\r\nthe inventor of those iron cages which had long been known in Italy.\r\nStill he had the “merit” of being their importer into France; and the\r\n_lex talionis_ has its application to him. One remembers of course the\r\nRegent Morton hugged to death by the “maiden” he had been the means of\r\nintroducing into Scotland. The French doctor, Guillotin, is even now\r\nnot uncommonly believed to have perished in the reign of terror by the\r\ninstrument invented by and named after him; whereas he quietly died in\r\nhis bed, many, many years later than that. But the Revolution history\r\nis well stored with instances like that of Châlier, condemned to death\r\nby the criminal tribunal at Lyons,—the guillotine, which he had sent\r\nfor from Paris to destroy his enemies, being first destined to sever\r\nhis own head from his body. A bungling executioner prolonged the last\r\nagonies of this man, who in fact was hacked to death, not decapitated.\r\nHe tasted slowly, as Lamartine says, of the death, a thirst for which\r\nhe had so often sought to excite in the people; “he was glutted with\r\nblood, but it was his own.” Alison recognises in the death of Murat a\r\nmemorable instance of the moral retribution which often attends upon\r\n“great deeds of iniquity, and by the instrumentality of the very acts\r\nwhich appeared to place them beyond its reach.” He underwent in 1815\r\nthe very fate to which, seven years before, he had consigned a hundred\r\nSpaniards at Madrid, guilty of no other crime than that of defending\r\ntheir country; and this, as Sir Archibald adds, “by the application\r\nof a law to his own case, which he himself had introduced, to check\r\nthe attempts of the Bourbons to regain a throne which he had usurped.”\r\nNo man, Lord Macaulay affirms, ever made a more unscrupulous use of\r\nthe legislative power for the destruction of his enemies than Thomas\r\nCromwell; and it was by an unscrupulous use of the legislative power\r\nthat he was himself destroyed. Those who tauntingly reminded Fenwick,\r\nwhen attainted in 1696, that he had supported the bill which attainted\r\nMonmouth, were warned that they might perhaps themselves be tauntingly\r\nreminded in some dark and terrible hour, that they had supported the bill\r\nwhich attainted Fenwick. “God forbid that our tyrants should ever be able\r\nto plead, in justification of the worst that they can inflict upon us,\r\nprecedents furnished by ourselves!” Again, it is in recording how, late\r\nin life, a horrible calumny settled upon Cicero, that Mr. de Quincey,\r\nwithout lending a moment’s credit to the foul insinuation, nevertheless\r\nis free to recognise the equity of this retribution revolving upon one\r\nwho, he asserts, had so often slandered others in the same malicious\r\nway. “At last the poisoned chalice came round to his own lips, and at a\r\nmoment when it wounded the most acutely.” _Sæpe_, as Seneca has it, _in\r\nmagistrum scelera redierunt sua_.\r\n\r\nFor\r\n\r\n                              “in these cases\r\n    We still have judgment here; that we but teach\r\n    Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return\r\n    To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice\r\n    Commends the ingredients of our poisoned chalice\r\n    To our own lips.”\r\n\r\nPlutarch rejoices in showing in Hercules an avenger who adapted the\r\nspecial mode of vengeance to the distinctive deserts of the wrong-doer.\r\nHe punished with the very mode of punishment devised by those who were\r\nnow made to suffer it. Antæus he killed in wrestling, and Termerus by\r\nbreaking his skull,—it being the _specialité_ of Termerus to destroy\r\nthe passengers he met by dashing his head against theirs. Theseus was\r\nthe imitator of Hercules in this retributive system; he punished Sinis,\r\na bandit,—who used to kill travellers by binding them to the boughs of\r\ntwo pine-trees, which were then allowed to swing back and separate—by\r\nmaking an end of him in the self-same way; Procrustes again he stretched\r\non his own bed. Phalaris, the tyrant of Agrigentum, infamous for his\r\ncruelty, and specially for the device devised for him by Perillus of a\r\nbrazen bull in which he burnt his victims—this Phalaris first tried the\r\ndevice on this Perillus; and when Phalaris was deposed an indignant mob\r\npractised upon _him_ the self-same torture to which he had subjected\r\nso many. And ever memorable among other tales of antiquity,—old wives’\r\nfables if you will, but then have not all fables a moral?—is that of\r\nDiomedes, who was devoured by the horses he had himself taught to feed\r\non the flesh and blood of men. “Ashes always fly back in the face of\r\nhim that throws them,” is a proverb in the Yoruba language, quoted by\r\nArchbishop Trench as equivalent to our “Harm watch, harm catch,” and\r\nperhaps to the Spanish, “He that sows thorns, let him not walk barefoot.”\r\nAn overruling Power disposes of what the malignity of man proposes, and\r\n\r\n    “Thus doth it force the swords of wicked men\r\n    To turn their own points on their masters’ bosoms.”\r\n\r\nThe psalmist felt that he was praying in accordance with the Divine will,\r\nwhen he prayed that the ungodly might fall into their own nets together,\r\nwhile he ever escaped them. So again with his prayer that the mischief\r\nof their own lips might fall upon the heads of them that compassed him\r\nabout. For it was a matter at once of faith and of experience with the\r\npsalmist, that the evil deviser and evil-doer, travailing with mischief,\r\nconceiving sorrow, and bringing forth ungodliness, who had graven and\r\ndigged up a pit, was apt to fall himself into the destruction that he\r\nmade for other. “For his travail shall come upon his own head, and his\r\nwickedness shall fall on his own pate.” Owen Feltham delights to recall,\r\nfrom the stores of ancient and mediæval story, how Bagoas, a Persian\r\nnobleman, having poisoned Artaxerxes and Artamenes, was detected by\r\nDarius, and forced to drink poison himself; how Diomedes, as we have\r\nalready seen, for the beasts he had fed on human flesh was by Hercules\r\nmade food; and how Pope Alexander VI., having designed the poisoning of\r\nhis friend Cardinal Adrian, by his cup-bearer’s mistake of the bottle,\r\ntook the draught himself, “and so died by the same engine which he\r\nhimself had appointed to kill another”—a sort of enginery glanced at in\r\nBen Jonson:—\r\n\r\n          “I have you in a purse-net,\r\n    Good master Picklock, with your worming brain,\r\n    And wriggling engine-head”\r\n\r\ntoo clever by half. Luther, in his Table-talk, welcomes the import of the\r\nJewish story of Og, king of Bashan, who they say had lifted a great rock\r\nto throw at his enemies, “but God made a hole in the middle, so that it\r\nslipped down upon the giant’s neck, and he could never rid himself of\r\nit.” The fourth book of Southey’s “Thalaba” closes with a shriek from\r\nLobaba the sorcerer, which this final stanza sufficiently explains:\r\n\r\n    “What, wretch, and hast thou raised\r\n    The rushing terrors of the wilderness,\r\n    To fall on thine own head?\r\n    Death! death! inevitable death!\r\n    Driven by the breath of God,\r\n    A column of the desert met his way.”\r\n\r\nNor, among the lyrical pieces of the same poet, be forgotten that ballad\r\nof the Inchcape rock, which tells how the bell put up by the abbot of\r\nAberbrothok to warn ships of their peril, was taken down by a sea pirate,\r\nSir Ralph the Rover, who in the words of an old Scottish topographer, “a\r\nyeare thereafter perished upon the same rocke, with ship and goodes, in\r\nthe righteous judgment of God.” Many and many\r\n\r\n          “stories have been told of men whose lives\r\n    Were infamous, and so their end. I mean\r\n    That the red murderer has himself been murdered;\r\n    The traitor struck with treason; he who let\r\n    The orphan perish came himself to want:\r\n    Thus justice and great God have ordered it!\r\n    So that the scene of evil has been turned\r\n    Against the actor; pain paid back with pain;\r\n    And poison given for poison.”\r\n\r\nPrescott’s narrative of the decline and fall of Luna, minister under John\r\nII. of Castile, is pointed with this moral to adorn the tale; that “by\r\none of those dispensations of Providence which often confound the plans\r\nof the wisest, the column which the minister had so artfully raised for\r\nhis support served only to crush him.” _Sæpe intereunt aliis meditantes\r\nnecem_; and that by the very means mediated.\r\n\r\n    “For ’tis the sport, to have the engineer\r\n    Hoist with his own petard,”\r\n\r\nsays Hamlet, in vindictive anticipation of such an issue, or rather\r\nupshot. The guilty king, his uncle, suggests misgivings lest his arrows,\r\nby a certain mischance, might\r\n\r\n            “have reverted to my bow again,\r\n    And not where I had aimed them;”\r\n\r\nand arrows, so returning, are by poetical justice apt to do the foiled\r\nbowman a mischief. That king’s fellow-conspirator, Laertes, is thus\r\npunished, and owns it:—\r\n\r\n    “_Osric._ How is’t, Laertes?\r\n\r\n    _Laertes._ Why as a woodcock to my own springe, Osric;\r\n    I am justly killed with mine own treachery.”\r\n\r\nAnd so is the king himself; and he, Laertes testifies,—\r\n\r\n              “is justly served:\r\n    It is a poison tempered by himself”\r\n\r\nfor Hamlet, which Claudius has just drank of, and drinking died. The\r\ntragedy of the prince of Denmark does indeed abound in instances of what\r\nHoratio calls\r\n\r\n    “Accidental judgments, casual slaughters,\r\n    And deaths put on by cunning and forced cause;\r\n    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook\r\n    Fallen on the inventors’ heads.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_TO-DAY’S SUFFICING EVIL, AND TO-MORROW’S FORECAST CARE._\r\n\r\nST. MATTHEW vi. 34.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith a divine calm fall those words from the Sermon of the Mount—spoken\r\nas never man spake—which bid us take “no thought for the morrow; for the\r\nmorrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the\r\nday is the evil thereof.”\r\n\r\nPagan philosophy had, and natural theism has, its approximation to\r\nthe same point of view. Horace is all for letting the mind enjoy the\r\nenjoyable present, and for leaving no room or resting-place for the sole\r\nof the foot of Black Care, raven and unclean bird that she is. The morrow\r\nmay be hers, but to-day at least is his, and the morrow shall take care\r\nfor the things of itself:\r\n\r\n    “Lætus in præsens animus quod ultra est\r\n    Oderit curare.”\r\n\r\nDavid Hume, again, meets the doctrine that we should always have before\r\nour eyes, death, disease, poverty, blindness, calumny, and the like,\r\nas ills which are incident to human nature, and which may befall us\r\nto-morrow,—by the answer, that if we confine ourselves to a general and\r\ndistant reflection on the ills of human life, such a vague procedure can\r\nhave no effect to prepare us for them; and that if, on the other hand, by\r\nclose and intense meditation we render them present and intimate to us,\r\nwe realise the true secret for poisoning all our pleasures, and rendering\r\nus perpetually miserable. He grieves more than need be, who begins to\r\ngrieve before he need, is one of Seneca’s sententious sayings: _Plus\r\ndolet quam necesse est, qui ante dolet quam necesse est_. One of Mrs.\r\nGore’s women of the world—who might probably be counted by the hundred—is\r\nsprightly and smart in her rebuke of her husband and his sister for their\r\ndelight in perplexing the brightest moments of existence by all the\r\nagonies of second sight, and whom she represents as quite indignant when\r\nthey find her sympathy waiting the actual occurrence of evil. “I hate,”\r\nshe says, “to turn back my head towards the dark shadow that follows me,\r\nor direct my telescope towards a coming storm.” And herein was she wise,\r\nif not with all the wisdom of those Christian morals, of which we have so\r\nimpressive an expositor in Sir Thomas Browne. “Leave future occurrences\r\nto their uncertainties,” writes the fine old physician, Religiosus\r\nMedicus, “think that which is present thy own; and, since ’tis easier to\r\nforetell an eclipse than a foul day at some distance, look for little\r\nregular below. Attend with patience the uncertainty of things, and what\r\nlieth yet unexerted in the chaos of futurity.” Shakspeare’s noble Roman,\r\nat the dawn of the day of battle on which so much depends, is natural man\r\nenough to utter the aspiration:\r\n\r\n                “O, that a man might know\r\n    The end of this day’s business, ere it come!”\r\n\r\nBut he is also stoic philosopher enough to check that prospective\r\nyearning, with the reflection,\r\n\r\n    “But it sufficeth that the day will end,\r\n    And then the end is known.”\r\n\r\nSwift opens his Birthday Address to Stella with the assurance,\r\n\r\n    “This day, whate’er the fates decree,\r\n    Shall still be kept with joy by me:\r\n    This day, then, let us not be told,\r\n    That you are sick and I grown old;\r\n    Nor think on our approaching ills,\r\n    And talk of spectacles and pills;\r\n    To-morrow will be time enough\r\n    To hear such mortifying stuff.”\r\n\r\nFor once, however, it is only in the opening verses that the dean\r\nis jocose; and he soon turns aside from his strain of levity to bid\r\nStella accept some serious lines “from not the gravest of divines.”\r\nSchleiermacher, in one of his rather gushing letters,—for he, too, though\r\nnothing of a Swift, and though of real weight in divinity, was not in all\r\nsenses the gravest of divines,—implores his “dearest Jette” not to look\r\nso much into the future. He cannot beg this too earnestly and too often,\r\nhe says,—so depressed is Jette apt to be by anticipation of things to\r\ncome, and from a perverse habit of condensing advent difficulties. “It is\r\neasy to see through _one_ pane of glass, but through ten placed one upon\r\nanother we cannot see. Does this prove that each one is not transparent?\r\nor are we ever called upon to look through more than one at a time?\r\nDouble panes we only have recourse to for warmth; and just so it is with\r\nlife. We have but to live _one_ moment at a time. Keep each one isolated,\r\nand you will easily see your way through them.” So again writes good\r\nFrederick Perthes to his wife, whose fearful and hopeful longings, he\r\ntells her, are indeed guarantees for the great future beyond the grave,\r\nbut whom he urges to bear in mind that a vigorous grasp of the present\r\nis our duty so long as we are upon earth. It is the present moment, he\r\nreminds her, that supplies the energy and decision that fit us for life;\r\nretrospect brings sadness, and the dark future excites fears, so that we\r\nshould be crippled in our exertions were we not to lay a vigorous grasp\r\nupon the present. And\r\n\r\n    “Labour with what zeal you will,\r\n      Something still remains undone;\r\n    Something uncompleted still\r\n      Waits the rising of the sun.\r\n\r\n    By the bedside, on the stair,\r\n      At the threshold, near the gates,\r\n    With its menace or its prayer,\r\n      Like a mendicant it waits;\r\n\r\n    Waits, and will not go away;\r\n      Waits, and will not be gainsaid:\r\n    By the cares of yesterday\r\n      Each to-day is heavier made;\r\n\r\n    Till at length the burden seems\r\n      Greater than our strength can bear;\r\n    Heavy as the weight of dreams\r\n      Pressing on us everywhere.\r\n\r\n    And we stand from day to day,\r\n      Like the dwarfs of times gone by,\r\n    Who, as Northern legends say,\r\n      On their shoulders held the sky.”\r\n\r\nQuite exceptional is the temperament impersonated by Wordsworth in one\r\nwho seemed a man of cheerful yesterdays and confident to-morrows.\r\n\r\nLongfellow has his midnight reflection on To-morrow; himself a watcher\r\nand contemplative, his little ones asleep: and thus the _pensées_ end:\r\n\r\n    “To-morrow! the mysterious, unknown guest,\r\n      Who cries to me, ‘Remember Barmecide,\r\n    And tremble to be happy with the rest.’\r\n      And I make answer, ‘I am satisfied;\r\n    I dare not ask; I know not what is best;\r\n      God hath already said what shall betide.’”\r\n\r\nThere is never, observes Madame d’Arblay, in her diary, such a\r\nsuperfluity of actual happiness as to make it either rational or\r\njustifiable to feed upon _expected_ misery. “That portion of philosophy\r\nwhich belongs to making the most of the present day, grows upon me\r\nstrongly; and, as I have suffered infinitely from its neglect, it is what\r\nI most encourage, and, indeed, require.” Kindly ordained, she takes it,\r\nis the concealment of\r\n\r\n                  “the day of sorrow;\r\n    And enough is the present tense of toil—\r\n    For this world, to all, is a stiffish soil—\r\n    And the mind flies back with a glad recoil\r\n        From the debts not due till to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nIt is one of Scott’s young heroes who opens a letter of troublous tidings\r\nwith the confession that, until now, he had rarely known what it was to\r\nsustain a moment’s real sorrow; what he called such was, he now felt\r\nassured, only the weariness of mind which, having nothing actually\r\npresent to complain of, turns upon itself, and becomes anxious about the\r\nfuture—disregarding the Scriptural monition that sufficient unto the day\r\nis the evil thereof. Is there, Armstrong asks,\r\n\r\n                  “an evil worse than fear itself?\r\n    And what avails it that indulgent Heaven\r\n    From mortal eyes has wrapt the woes to come,\r\n    If we, ingenious to torment ourselves,\r\n    Grow pale at hideous fictions of our own?\r\n      Enjoy the present; nor, with needless cares\r\n    Of what may spring from blind misfortune’s womb,\r\n    Appal the surest hours that life bestows:\r\n    Serene, and master of yourself, prepare\r\n    For what may come; and leave the rest to Heaven.”\r\n\r\nPrevision and imagination, as Rousseau says, multiply the evils of our\r\nlot: “_Pour moi_,” he professes—however the profession may have squared\r\nwith the practice—“_j’ai beau savoir que je soufrirai demain, il me\r\nsuffit de ne pas souffrir aujourd’hui pour être tranquille_.” It is\r\ncertainly a frenzy, quoth old Montaigne, to go now and whip yourself,\r\nbecause it may so fall out that fortune may one day decree you a\r\nwhipping, and to put on your furred gown at Midsummer, because you will\r\nstand in need of it at Christmas. It was one of Madame de Sévigné’s\r\nmaxims in life to “regarder l’avenir comme une obscurité, dont il peut\r\narriver des biens et des clartés à quoi l’on ne s’attend pas.” Milton’s\r\nAdam laments the mournful privilege of “visions ill foreseen.” Better had\r\nhe lived ignorant of future! so had borne his part of evil only, each\r\nday’s lot enough to bear. So again, in Milton’s Masque, the elder brother\r\nbids the younger be not over-exquisite to cast the fashion of uncertain\r\nevils:\r\n\r\n    “For grant they be so, while they rest unknown,\r\n    What need a man forestall his date of grief,\r\n    And run to meet what he would most avoid?”\r\n\r\nAnd once more, Milton himself, in one of those Sonnets which stand in\r\nthe like relation of merit to his great epic that Shakspeare’s do to\r\nhis great dramas, admonishes his scholar, Cyriack Skinner, that heaven\r\ndisproves the care,\r\n\r\n                      “though wise in show,\r\n    That with superfluous burden loads the day,\r\n    And when God sends a cheerful hour, refrains.”\r\n\r\n“Melancholy commonly flies to the future for its aliment,” says Sydney\r\nSmith, “and it must be encountered,” he adds, “by diminishing the range\r\nof our views.” The great remedy for melancholy, he insists in another\r\nplace, is to “take short views of life.” Are you happy now? Then why\r\ndestroy present happiness by a distant misery, which may never come at\r\nall? For “every substantial grief has twenty shadows, and most of them\r\nshadows of your own making.” One of his correspondents he emphatically\r\ncounsels to dispel that prophetic gloom which dives into futurity, to\r\nextract sorrow from days and years to come, and which considers its\r\nown unhappy visions as the decrees of Providence. “We know nothing of\r\nto-morrow, our business is to be good and happy to day.” In effect, like\r\nMaucroix,\r\n\r\n    “Il rit de ces prudents qui, par trop de sagesse,\r\n    S’en vont dans l’avenir chercher de la tristesse\r\n                    Et des soucis cuisants.”\r\n\r\nOnce and again in his autobiography does the most influential, perhaps,\r\nof French philosophers avow his resolve _á vivre désormais au jour la\r\njournée_, to take short views of life, and regard distant objects as at\r\nonce illusive and elusory. “Usons de chaque jour sans trop de prévoyance\r\ndu lendemain,” says another. And it was an old French poet, fourscore and\r\nupwards, who in 1700 wrote the four verses which since then have been\r\noften cited:\r\n\r\n    “Chaque jour est un bien que du ciel je reçois,\r\n      Je jouis aujourd’hui de celui qu’il me donne;\r\n    Il n’appartient pas plus aux jeunes gens qu’a moi,\r\n      Et celui de demain n’appartient a personne.”\r\n\r\nDr. Boyd recognises as sound philosophy in Sydney Smith, the advising\r\nus, whether physically or morally, to “take short views.” One of his\r\nillustrations to the purpose is, that it would knock you up at once if,\r\nwhen the railway carriage moved out of the station at Edinburgh, you\r\nbegan to trace in your mind’s eye the whole route to London. Never do\r\nthat, he says; think first of Dunbar, then of Newcastle, then of York,\r\nand, putting the thing thus, you will get over the distance without\r\nfatigue of mind. What little child, he asks, would have heart to begin\r\nthe alphabet, if, before he did so, you put clearly before him all\r\nthe school and college work of which it is the beginning? “The poor\r\nlittle thing would knock up at once, wearied out by your want of skill\r\nin putting things. And so it is that Providence, kindly and gradually\r\nputting things, whiles us onward, still keeping hope and heart, through\r\nthe trials and cares of life.” Every dog has its day, quaintly observes\r\nA. H. K. B. on another occasion; but the day of the rational dog is\r\noverclouded in a fashion unknown to his inferior fellow-creatures; it\r\nis overclouded by the anticipation of the coming day which will not be\r\nhis. And the essayist reminds us accordingly how “that great though\r\nmorbid man, John Foster,” could not heartily enjoy the summer weather,\r\nfor thinking how every sunny day that shone upon him was a downward step\r\ntowards the winter gloom—each indication that the season was advancing,\r\nthough only to greater beauty, filling him with a sort of forecast\r\nregret. “I have seen a fearful sight to-day,” he would say, “I have\r\nseen a buttercup.” And we know, of course, adds his critic, “that in his\r\ncase there was nothing like affectation; it was only that, unhappily for\r\nhimself, the bent of his mind was so onward-looking, that he saw only a\r\npremonition of December in the roses of June.” Waife, in Lord Lytton’s\r\nstory, checks his grandchild’s query when, happy, and unaccustomed to\r\nhappiness, and therefore distrusting its continuance, she wistfully\r\nexclaims, “It cannot last, can it?” “’Tis no use in this life, my dear,”\r\nWaife tells her, “no use at all disturbing present happiness by asking,\r\n‘Can it last?’ To-day is man’s, to-morrow his Maker’s.” Life being a\r\nsuccession of stages, urges another practical philosopher, we should\r\nthink of one stage at a time. Most people, he judiciously reminds us,\r\ncan bear one day’s evil; what breaks men down is the trying to bear on\r\none day the evil of two days, twenty days, a hundred days. “We can bear\r\na day of pain, followed by a night of pain, and that again by a day of\r\npain, and thus onward. But we can bear each day and night of pain, only\r\nby taking each by itself. We can break each rod, but not the bundle.”\r\nAnd the sufferer, in real great suffering, is well described as turning\r\nto the wall in blank despair, when he looks too far on. To cite another\r\nillustration of A. K. H. B.’s, we should, for certain purposes, look\r\nnot at the entire chain, but at each successive link of it; we know, of\r\ncourse, that each link will be succeeded by the next; but we should think\r\nof them one at a time.\r\n\r\nDo not say, _wait the end_, is a maxim of Paul Louis Courier’s, who\r\ndeclares that, saving the respect due to the ancients, nothing is more\r\nfalse than that rule. “The evil of to-morrow shall never deprive me\r\nof the good of to-day,” is one of the brilliant Frenchman’s resolves.\r\nAnother brilliant but highly bilious Frenchman testifies from observation\r\nand experience to the necessity, in the long run, of living from day to\r\nday, without indulgence either in unavailing regrets or anxious forecast,\r\n“on s’aperçoit qu’il faut vivre au jour le jour, oublier beaucoup, enfin\r\néponger la vie à mésure qu’elle s’écoule.” But it may too truly be said\r\nof this philosopher that he wrote, and lived, as one having no hope, and\r\nwithout God in the world.\r\n\r\nHorace was in his placid _Il Penseroso_ mood when he counselled the\r\nacceptance of each new-born day as possibly one’s last, and appropriating\r\nit accordingly:\r\n\r\n    “Inter spem curamque, timores inter et iras,\r\n    Omnem crede diem tibi diluxisse supremum:\r\n    Grata superveniet quæ non sperabitur hora.”\r\n\r\nWe might suggest suggestive parallels by the score, as this from a play\r\nof Leigh Hunt’s,\r\n\r\n    “One day—could you not try one day and then\r\n    Enjoy or fear another as it suited?\r\n    Ay, one—one—one. Try but one day, and then\r\n    Trust me if one day would not give you strength,”\r\n\r\nfor morrows in store. Or this, from a poem of Owen Meredith’s:\r\n\r\n    “Be quiet! Take things as they come;\r\n      Each hour will draw out some surprise.\r\n    With blessing let the days go home:\r\n      Thou shalt have thanks from evening skies.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_MEDICAMENTAL MUSIC._\r\n\r\n1 SAMUEL xvi. 23.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the days when Saul loved David greatly, and found comfort in the\r\nconstant presence of his favourite, it sometimes “came to pass that when\r\nthe evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and\r\nplayed with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil\r\nspirit departed from him.”\r\n\r\nThat there is something more than ordinary in music, Bishop Beveridge, in\r\nhis “Private Thoughts,” infers from this fact—that David made use of the\r\nharp for driving away the evil spirit from Saul, as well as for bringing\r\nthe good spirit upon himself. The gentle prelate therefore recognises\r\nin music a sort of secret and charming power, such as naturally dispels\r\n“those black humours which the evil spirit is apt to brood upon,” and\r\nsuch too as composes the mind into a more regular, sweet, and docile\r\ndisposition, thereby rendering it “the fitter for the Holy Spirit\r\nto work upon, the more susceptive of Divine grace, and more faithful\r\nmessenger to convey truth to the understanding.” And he cites his\r\npersonal experience—_experto crede_—in favour of this view.\r\n\r\nAnatomizing melancholy, old Burton adds to the instance of David that\r\nof Elisha, who when he was troubled by importunate kings, called for a\r\nminstrel, “and when he played, the hand of the Lord came upon him.” Of\r\ncourse the erudite anatomist heaps up corroborative instances of all\r\nkinds and ages, mythological, classical, mediæval; and he quotes many of\r\nthose obscure and obsolete authorities whom it has been the cheap policy\r\nof many a bookmaker to cite from Burton’s _thesaurus_ second-hand.\r\n\r\nSpenser opens a canto of his “Faerie Queene” with a tribute to the powers\r\nof minstrelsy as exercised by Orpheus,—\r\n\r\n    “Or such as that celestial psalmist was,\r\n      That when the wicked fiend his lord tormented,\r\n    With heavenly notes, that did all others pass,\r\n      The outrage of his furious fit relented.”\r\n\r\nOr again, to quote a parallel passage from a later poet of the didactic\r\nschool, whom, perhaps simply because he (Dr. Armstrong) was didactic,\r\nsome people think as essentially prosy as Spenser is on all sides allowed\r\nto be quintessentially poetical:—\r\n\r\n    “Such was the bard, whose heavenly strains of old\r\n    Appeased the fiend of melancholy Saul.”\r\n\r\nBuretti declares music to have the power of so affecting the whole\r\nnervous system as to give sensible ease in a large variety of disorders,\r\nand in some cases a radical cure. Particularly he instances sciatica as\r\ncapable of being relieved by this agency. Theophrastus is mentioned by\r\nPliny as recommending it for the hip gout; and there are references on\r\nrecord by old Cato and Varro to the same effect. Æsculapius figures in\r\nPindar as healing acute disorders with soothing songs.\r\n\r\n    “Music exalts each joy, allays each grief,\r\n    Expels diseases, softens every pain,\r\n    Subdues the rage of poison and of plague:\r\n    And hence the wise of ancient days adored\r\n    One power of Physic, Melody, and Song.”\r\n\r\nOver Luther, as Sir James Stephen has remarked, there brooded a\r\nconstitutional melancholy, sometimes engendering sadness, but more often\r\ngiving birth to dreams so wild that, if vivified by the imagination of\r\nDante, they might have passed into visions as awful and majestic as those\r\nof the “Inferno.” Various were the spells to which Luther had recourse,\r\nto cast out the demons that haunted him; and of these remedial agencies\r\nthe most potent perhaps was music. “He had ascertained and taught\r\nthat the spirit of darkness abhors sweet sounds not less than light\r\nitself; for music (he says), while it chases away the evil suggestions,\r\neffectually baffles the wiles of the tempter. His lute, and hand, and\r\nvoice, accompanying his own solemn melodies, were therefore raised to\r\nrepel the vehement aggressions of the enemy of mankind.”\r\n\r\nA story is told of Farinelli, the famous singer, being sent for express\r\nto Madrid, to try the effect of his magical voice on the king of Spain,\r\nwho was then buried in the profoundest melancholy—proof against every\r\nappeal to exertion, living without signs of life in a darkened chamber,\r\nthe unresisting prey of dejection beyond relief. But relief came with\r\nFarinelli. The vocalist was desired by the physicians to sing in an outer\r\nroom, which for a day or two he did, without any apparent effect upon\r\nthe royal patient. But at length it was noticed that the king seemed\r\npartially roused from his stupor, and became an evident listener; next\r\nday tears were seen starting from his eyes; the day after he ordered the\r\ndoor of his chamber to be left open; and at last “the perturbed spirit\r\nentirely left our modern Saul, and the medicinal voice of Farinelli\r\neffected what no other medicine could.” Well known in modern verse is the\r\npoet’s picture of a despairing sufferer, whom nought avails to move until—\r\n\r\n    “At last a slave bethought her of a harp:\r\n    The harper came, and tuned his instrument;\r\n    At the first notes, irregular and sharp,\r\n    On him her flashing eyes a moment bent,\r\n    Then to the wall she turned as if to warp\r\n    Her thoughts from sorrow through her heart re-sent.\r\n    ...\r\n    Anon her thin wan fingers beat the wall\r\n    In time to his old tune ...\r\n                ... And in a gushing stream\r\n    The tears rushed forth from her o’erclouded brain,\r\n    Like mountain mists at length dissolved in rain.”\r\n\r\nNor be forgotten the impressive instance of Schiller’s Wallenstein, in\r\nhis hour of darkness, tranquillised by Thekla’s voice and lute:—\r\n\r\n            “Come here, my girl. Seat thee by me,\r\n    For there is a good spirit on thy lips.\r\n    Thy mother praised to me thy ready skill;\r\n    She says a voice of melody dwells in thee,\r\n    Which doth enchant the soul. Now such a voice\r\n    Will drive away from me the evil demon\r\n    That beats his black wings close above my head.”\r\n\r\nWilliam Godwin makes his savage Tyrell amenable to well warbled melody.\r\nReaders of Scott will remember how a frenzied Highlander is soothed into\r\nself restraint by the minstrelsy of Annot Lyle. Goethe makes the first\r\nbar of an air by Gretchen suffice to lull the sorrows of young Werter,\r\nwho protests that “instantly the gloom and madness which hang over me are\r\ndispersed, and I breathe freely again.” Another Charlotte—our English\r\nRichardson’s—is less successful in her manipulation of medicinal melody,\r\nwhen essaying to subdue an angry spirit by the spells of song: “I go to\r\nmy harpsichord; music enrages him. He is worse than Saul; for Saul could\r\nbe gloomily pleased with the music even of the man he hated,” But this is\r\nantedating Saul’s aversion; in those days Saul loved David greatly.\r\n\r\nDr. Croly, in an eloquent paragraph of his elaborate eastern romance,\r\nrecords how carefully music, “of all pleasures the most intellectual,\r\nthat glorious painting to the ear, that rich mastery of the gloomier\r\nemotions of our nature,” was studied by the Jewish priesthood, and with\r\na skill that influenced the habits of the country. “How often,” exclaims\r\nSalathiel, “have my fiercest perturbations sunk, at the sounds that once\r\nfilled the breezes of Judæa! How often, when my brain was burning, and\r\nthe blood ran through my veins like molten brass, have I been softened\r\ndown to painless tears by the chorus from our hills, the mellow harmony\r\nof harp and horn, blending with the voices of the youths and maidens of\r\nIsrael!”\r\n\r\nIt is characteristic, as Herr Kohl observes, of music-loving Bohemia,\r\nthat in the lunatic asylum of its capital, music should be considered one\r\nof the chief aids and appliances for the improvement of the patients. In\r\naddition to the garden concerts, in which all assist who can, there is\r\nchamber music—quartets, trios, etc.,—every morning and evening in the\r\nwards; and a musical director takes high rank in the official staff of\r\nthe establishment.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Charlotte of Orleans, mother of the Regent, describes in one\r\nof her letters a Madame de Persillie, well born and well bred, but a\r\ndangerous lunatic; who however, if you could but slip a guitar into her\r\nhand when the fury-fit came on, would become calm again as soon as she\r\nbegan to play. “I pity her greatly,” writes the good-natured duchess\r\n(whose homely German nature never became properly assimilated to the\r\nFrench court); “she was very fond of me, and used to address me as _Mon\r\naimable_; but whenever she came to see me I always had a guitar quite\r\nready for her.” It was but common prudence to be thus prepared for the\r\nworst; and when the worst came to the worst, then a guitar was best.\r\n\r\nSchleiermacher exclaims in one of his letters, “Surely, if there was\r\nany good in Saul’s innermost soul it must have been an _adagio_ that\r\nexorcised the evil spirit.” The evil spirit in question is introduced\r\nby name, Malzah, in a recent Canadian drama, and is made to avow the\r\naccomplished fact of exorcism in the following strain:—\r\n\r\n    “Music, music hath its sway:\r\n    Music’s order I obey,\r\n    I have unwound myself at sound\r\n    From off Saul’s heart, where coiled I lay.”\r\n\r\nWhich snaky or serpentine similitude is akin to a passage in Mr.\r\nBrowning’s “Paracelsus”—distant as the kinship between the two poems may\r\nbe in other respects:\r\n\r\n    “My heart! they loose my heart, those simple words;\r\n    Its darkness passes, which nought else could touch;\r\n    Like some dank snake that force may not expel,\r\n    Which glideth out to music sweet and low.”\r\n\r\nAgain and again in Shakspeare is the remedial agency of music resorted\r\nto by afflicted royalty. At one time it is Queen Katharine, fading and\r\nheartsore, who bids one of her women cease working, and sing—\r\n\r\n    “Take thy lute, wench; my soul grows sad with troubles;\r\n    Sing, and disperse them if thou canst.”\r\n\r\nAnd the singer’s theme is how “in sweet music is such art, killing care\r\nand grief at heart.” At another time it is dying Harry IV., who prays his\r\nattendants, as they bear him to an inner room—\r\n\r\n    “Let there be no noise made, my gentle friends!\r\n    Unless some dull[8] and favourable hand\r\n    Will whisper music to my weary spirit.”\r\n\r\nAnd once more, we have Lear’s physician prescribing music for the safer\r\nawakening of the distraught old man from that long sleep which was only\r\nnot his last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_FREE FROM RIGHTEOUSNESS._\r\n\r\nROMANS vi. 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn being, and so long as they continued, slaves of sin (δοῦλοι τής\r\nἁμαρτίας), the recipients of St. Paul’s epistle to the Romans are\r\nforcibly described by him as having been, _ipso facto_, free from\r\nrighteousness (ἐλεύθεροι τῇ δικαιοσύνῃ). But what fruit had they in the\r\nfreedom of which they were now ashamed?\r\n\r\n    “He is the freeman whom the truth makes free,\r\n      And all are slaves beside.”\r\n\r\nThey knew that to whom men yield themselves servants to obey, his\r\nservants they are to whom they are obedient, whether of sin unto\r\ndeath, or of loyal service unto righteousness. There is a freedom from\r\nrighteousness, which is servitude to sin; and there is that service of\r\nGod which, though a service, or rather because a service, is perfect\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nGray, in the best known of his odes (best known by heart) devises this\r\nexpressive phrase,\r\n\r\n    “Constraint, that sweetens liberty.”\r\n\r\nIt refers to schoolboys, enjoying all the more their playground freedom\r\nfor the previous and succeeding restraints and constraints of the\r\nschoolroom. All work and no play makes a dull boy; but so does all play\r\nand no work. In this sense, as in so many others, does the paradox hold\r\ngood that half is more than the whole (πλέον ἥμισυ παντός), and even a\r\nschoolboy can find by experience that a half holiday may be more than a\r\nwhole one.\r\n\r\nWordsworth sounds the depths of this philosophy in his magnificent Ode to\r\nDuty. He is fatigued by freedom; he would be no longer the sport of every\r\nrandom gust; he would no longer stray in smooth walks, but would serve\r\nDuty more strictly if he might:—\r\n\r\n    “Through no disturbance of my soul,\r\n      Or strong compunction in me wrought,\r\n    _I supplicate for thy control_;\r\n      But in the quietness of thought:\r\n    _Me this uncharted freedom tires_;\r\n      I feel the weight of chance desires;\r\n    My hopes no more must change their name,\r\n      I long for a repose that ever is the same.”\r\n\r\nWhose service is perfect freedom—that is God’s service only. The true\r\ncharacter of that service (in Greek Testament phrase, _slavery_) is\r\naptly indicated by St. Paul to the Ephesians, where he speaks of _with\r\ngood will doing service_—μετ’ εὐνοίας ΔΟΥΛΕΥΟΝΤΕΣ, ὡς τῷ Κυρίῳ καὶ οὐκ\r\nἀνθρώποις. The law of the Spirit of life makes free from the law of\r\nsin and death, that the righteousness of spiritual law may be fulfilled\r\nin those who sometime were free from righteousness. Freedom from\r\nrighteousness is, in fact, identical with that bondage of corruption from\r\nwhich they are delivered into the glorious liberty of the children of\r\nGod. He that is so called, being free, is yet Christ’s servant, δοῦλος.\r\nAnd, as a servant, whatsoever he doeth he is to do heartily, as to the\r\nLord, and not to men—τῷ γὰρ Κυρίῳ Χριστῷ ΔΟΥΛΕΥΕΙ. Goethe’s biographer\r\ntells us how he would assert, against the encyclopedists, that “whatever\r\nfrees the intellect, without at the same time giving us command over\r\nourselves, is pernicious;” or would utter one of his profound and\r\npregnant γνῶμαι such as _Nur das Gesetz kann uns die Freiheit geben_,\r\ni.e., only within the circle of law can there be true freedom. “We are\r\nnot free when we acknowledge no higher power, but when we acknowledge it,\r\nand in reverence raise ourselves by proving that a Higher lives in us.”\r\nWe may wrest to our purpose the lines of Schiller, in _Wallensteins Tod_:\r\n\r\n    “Nay, let it not afflict you that your power\r\n    Is circumscribed. Much liberty, much error!\r\n    The narrow path of duty is securest.”\r\n\r\nLiberty of will is likened by Jeremy Taylor to the motion of a magnetic\r\nneedle towards the north, full of trembling and uncertainty till it be\r\nfixed in the beloved point: “it wavers as long as it is free, and is\r\nat rest when it can choose no more.” What is liberty? asks M. Jules\r\nSimon; and answers, The power of doing or not doing. But, he proceeds\r\nto inquire, can this liberty exist independent of law?—_cette liberté\r\npeut-elle subsister sans règle?_ Nay, liberty without rule, or law,\r\nso far from ennobling him who possesses it, degrades him. Liberty is\r\nnot given to us to withdraw us from the authority of law, but that\r\nwe may obey it in recognising its great First Cause. Unrestrained\r\nliberty is our ruin; liberty subjected to law, and that an immovable\r\nlaw, is the instrument and the token of our true greatness. Wordsworth\r\nphilosophically affirms that “all men may find cause, when life is at\r\na weary pause, and they have panted up the hill of duty with reluctant\r\nwill,” to\r\n\r\n    “Be thankful, even though tired and faint,\r\n    For the rich bounties of constraint;\r\n    Whence oft invigorating transports flow,\r\n    That choice lacked courage to bestow.”\r\n\r\nThe truth admits of exemplification in a thousand minor details of\r\nevery-day life. Mrs. Gaskell relates how she heard Charlotte Brontè\r\ndeclare, in reference to the “exact punctuality and obedience to the\r\nlaws of time and place” enforced by her somewhat despotic aunt on the\r\nmotherless family at Haworth parsonage, that no one but themselves could\r\ntell the value of this control in after life: “with their impulsive\r\nnatures it was positive repose to have learnt obedience to external\r\nlaws.” In the last of her own fictions—and, though unfinished, the ripest\r\nand best—Mrs. Gaskell herself suggestively observes of a patient who,\r\nwhen a medical adviser is at length called in, finds it a great relief to\r\nbe told what to do, what to eat, drink, and avoid, that “such decisions\r\n_ab extra_ are sometimes a wonderful relief to those whose habit has\r\nbeen to decide, not only for themselves, but for every one else;” and\r\nthat occasionally the relaxation of the strain which a character for\r\ninfallible wisdom brings with it does much to restore health. M. de\r\nVigny, in one of his highly finished _historiettes_, speculates on the\r\nnature and power of the instinct which seems to urge mankind, as by a\r\nkind of necessity, to seek pleasure in obedience, and to feel a desire\r\nto depose, as it were, their free agency and consequent responsibility\r\nin other hands; as if thereby a burden was laid down, too weighty to be\r\nvoluntarily supported; and how this sensation of relief seems to give a\r\nsecret feeling of complacency, and a freedom to the act of obedience,\r\nwhich reconcile it to the pride of human nature. Soldiers, observes Sir\r\nWalter Scott, are always most pleased when they are best in order for\r\nperforming their military service; and licence or inactivity, however\r\nacceptable at times, are not, when continued, so agreeable to men of the\r\ncamp as strict discipline and a prospect of employment. “I have heard men\r\ntalk of the blessings of freedom,” says Wamba to himself, when suddenly\r\nfreed from sharing the captivity of his master; “but I wish any wise\r\nman would teach me what use to make of it now that I have it.” So Elia,\r\nin his essay on The Superannuated Man, to whom life being now one long\r\nholiday has no holiday henceforth; where he expatiates on the sight of\r\n“busy faces to recreate the idle man, who contemplates them ever passing\r\nby—the very face of business a charm by contrast to his relaxation from\r\nit.” Many an individual experience can put its own private interpretation\r\non the averment of one of Rousseau’s correspondents—_Ce lien si redouté\r\nme delivre d’une servitude beaucoup plus redoubtable_.\r\n\r\nOf significant application again is De Quincey’s denial of the truth of\r\nLessing’s æsthetical assertion, that the sense of necessary and absolute\r\nlimitation is banished from the idea of a fine art. On the contrary,\r\nhe maintains this sense is indispensable as a means of resisting (and\r\ntherefore realizing) the sense of freedom: “the freedom of a fine art\r\nis found not in the absence of restraint, but in the conflict with it.”\r\nSo in literature. That certain rules of composition sustain themselves\r\nat all is due, according to Mr. W. Caldwell Roscoe, to the fact that\r\ncreative genius of a high order is not impatient of forms, but rather\r\nloves, on the contrary, to have certain limits defined for it, and to be\r\nfreed to some extent from “the weight of too much liberty.” Shakspeare,\r\nhe adds, did not fret because tragedies are limited to five acts, nor\r\nMilton quarrel with the formal conditions of an epic poem. Here again\r\nshall we find in Wordsworth a passage to the point:—\r\n\r\n    “In truth the prison, unto which we doom\r\n      Ourselves, no prison is: and hence for me,\r\n    In sundry moods, ’twas pastime to be bound\r\n    Within the Sonnet’s scanty plot of ground;\r\n      Pleased, if some souls (for such there needs must be),\r\n      Who have felt the weight of too much liberty,\r\n    Should find brief solace there, as I have found.”\r\n\r\nThe biographer of Edward Irving tells us how deeply he was affected when\r\nthe decision of the presbytery against him removed him from the range\r\nof their control, so that, “notwithstanding all his independence, the\r\nprofound loyalty of his soul was henceforth baulked of its healthful\r\nnecessities.” He felt himself with a pang to be cast unnaturally free\r\nof restraint—“that lawful, sweet restraint, ... to which the tender\r\ndutifulness so seldom wanting to great genius naturally clings.”[9]\r\nHabits of instant and mechanical obedience are affirmed by Sir Henry\r\nTaylor to be those that give rest to the child, and spare its health and\r\ntemper. Men are but children of a larger growth; and though as regards\r\nobedience to a Father which is in heaven, “mechanical” obedience may not\r\nbe the word, yet is cheerfully implicit obedience the thing; obedience is\r\nthe privilege of the child.\r\n\r\n    “For obedience is nobler than freedom. What’s free?\r\n    The vexed straw on the wind, the frothed spume on the sea.\r\n    The great ocean itself, as it rolls and it swells,\r\n    In the bonds of a boundless obedience dwells.”\r\n\r\nThe next section takes up the same theme under another heading, and with\r\na fresh set of variations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE SERVICE OF FREEDOM._\r\n\r\nST. MATTHEW xi. 29, 30.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is in tones of winning promise and invitation that men are offered\r\nthe wearing of Christ’s yoke. Let all who are weary and heavy laden come\r\nto Him: come, that they may take His yoke upon them. There is a seeming\r\nparadox in the invitation. Should not the weary be invited by promised\r\nfreedom from all yoke-bearing? Should not the heavy-laden be attracted by\r\na pledge of entire immunity from burdens grievous to be borne, whether\r\nheavy or light? Not so. Christ’s yoke is easy, but it is a yoke. The\r\nburden he imposes is light, but a burden of some sort He does impose.\r\nBeing made free from sin, men become the servants—servitors, slaves\r\neven, δοῦλοι, of righteousness. But in so being made free from sin, and\r\nbecoming servants, δοῦλοι, to God, they have their fruit unto holiness,\r\nand the end everlasting life. And the yoke of privilege promised by\r\nChrist differs from the irksome bonds and rigid constraint of scribes and\r\nrabbis; a yoke which, says St. Peter, neither we nor our fathers were\r\nable to bear, inasmuch as it implies and involves a purely spiritual\r\nservice—that we should serve (δουλεύειν) in newness of spirit, and not in\r\nthe oldness of the letter. “If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye\r\nshall be free indeed.”\r\n\r\nKeble says of men, in the “Christian Year,” that,\r\n\r\n    “Freely they own, or heedless prove,\r\n    The curse of lawless hearts, the joy of self-control.”\r\n\r\nThe joy of self-control. For what Wordsworth expressively calls\r\n“unchartered freedom,” as revelled in by those who ignore a holy and\r\nhappy-making law of duty, is not in the long run, a boon, but a bane.\r\nTrue, that, as Cowper has it,\r\n\r\n    “’Tis liberty alone that gives the flower\r\n    Of fleeting life its lustre and perfume,\r\n    And we are weeds without it. All constraint,\r\n    Except what wisdom lays on evil men,\r\n    Is evil.”\r\n\r\nBut the constraint that sweetens liberty is excepted; the control that\r\nenfranchises from servitude to self, and exalts to a liberty which\r\nmonarchs cannot grant: “’Tis liberty of heart, derived from Heaven,”\r\n“and held by charter;” “a clean escape from tyrannizing lust.” “Grace\r\nmakes the slave a freeman;” for “He is the freeman whom the truth makes\r\nfree, and all are slaves beside.” Byron was drawing on his own bitter\r\nexperience when he wrote the lines,\r\n\r\n    “Lord of himself—that heritage of woe,\r\n    That fearful empire which the human breast\r\n    But holds to rob the heart within of rest.”\r\n\r\nImlac, the sage, describes, in “Rasselas” the placid flow of life enjoyed\r\nby a devout brotherhood, whose “time is regularly distributed; one duty\r\nsucceeds another, so that they are not left open to the distraction of\r\nunguided choice, nor lost in the shades of listless inactivity. There\r\nis a certain task to be performed at an appropriated hour,” and the\r\nconstraint is to them a pledge of happiness, hallowed as it is with a\r\nDivine sanction, and promissory of “an ampler ether, a diviner air” to\r\ncome, in which they shall breathe more freely, and inhale more deeply,\r\nthe breath of life.\r\n\r\nFreedom is not the being free to do nothing, or to do just what one\r\nlikes, and when, and how, without why or wherefore. _La liberté n’est pas\r\noisiveté_, says La Bruyère; and then he proceeds to say what liberty is:\r\n“C’est le choix de travail et de l’exercice: être libre, en un mot, n’est\r\npas ne rien faire, c’est être seul arbitre de ce qu’on fait, ou de ce\r\nqu’on ne fait point. Quel bien en ce sens que la liberté!” But how much\r\nworthier of that note of admiration the gospel definitions, explicit or\r\nimplicit, of _ce que c’est la liberté_!\r\n\r\nThere is a touching suggestiveness in what Frederick Perthes says in a\r\nletter after the death of his wife. All his doings and plannings for four\r\nand twenty years past had been solely, he declares, in reference to her.\r\n“But now all this is over. I am no longer bound; I can do what I will,\r\nand next to the yearning after her, I am most oppressed in my solitude\r\nby the consciousness of freedom.” Fain would he be in those dear bonds\r\nagain; to apply a passage in one of Shakspeare’s minor poems, he\r\n\r\n                    “In her fillet still would bide,\r\n    And, true to bondage, would not break from thence.”\r\n\r\nOr as Ferdinand says of Miranda, in the “Tempest,”\r\n\r\n          “All corners else o’ the earth\r\n    Let liberty make use of; space enough\r\n    Have I in such a prison.”\r\n\r\nIn this sense may be applied in earnest what Butler writes in sport, of\r\nan independent spirit who\r\n\r\n    “Disdains control, and yet can be\r\n    Nowhere, but in a prison, free.”\r\n\r\nSo the sculptor in Hawthorne’s tale of “Transformation,” intent on\r\nwinning winsome Hilda for his own, “would try if it were possible to\r\ntake this shy, yet frank and innocently fearless creature captive, and\r\nimprison her in his heart, and make her sensible of a larger freedom\r\nthere than in all the world besides.” “I have read somewhere,” says a\r\nsimple maiden in one of Lord Lytton’s fictions, “that the slave is gay in\r\nhis holiday from toil; if you free him, the gaiety vanishes, and he cares\r\nno more for the dance under the palm-tree.” Don Alphonse, in Madame de\r\nRémusat’s “Lettres Espagnoles,” writes to his sister an account of the\r\ncourtiers’ embarrassment on being released by the king from ceremonial\r\nattendance, and allowed to do each one as he liked. “L’improvisation en\r\ntout est chose assez difficile, et particulièrement celle de la liberté.\r\nIl faut que je confesse que nous n’avons su que faire de la nôtre.” The\r\nmoral of the fable may be read in Landor’s lines, supposed to be indited\r\nby the caged nightingales so tenderly tended by Agapenthe, and brought to\r\nAthens for her from Thessaly, and who bid the reader think not\r\n\r\n    “That we would gladly fly again\r\n    To gloomy wood or windy plain.\r\n    Certain we are we ne’er should find\r\n    A care so provident, so kind....\r\n    O may you prove, as well as we,\r\n    That e’en in Athens there may be\r\n    A sweeter thing than liberty.”\r\n\r\nApply, again, to the general subject the special fact, by way of\r\nillustration, that restrictions and shackles are essential to rhythmic\r\nwriting, and voluntary thraldom the natural condition of poetry. The\r\nChevalier de la Faye, in his “Apology” for the supposed difficulties of\r\nrhyme in our Cisalpine dialects (one Italian poet being “distinguishable\r\namong his fellow-captives by the light aërial nature of his fetters,”)\r\nsuggests an ingenious parallel to the _jets d’eau_ that ornament the\r\ngardens of the Tuileries, Versailles, and St. Cloud, in a copy of verses\r\nwhich have been thus Englished by Father Prout:—\r\n\r\n    “From the rhyme’s restrictive rigour\r\n      Thought derives its impulse oft,\r\n    Genius draws new strength and vigour,\r\n      Fancy springs and shoots aloft.\r\n    So, in leaden conduits pent,\r\n    Mounts the liquid element,\r\n      By pressure forced to climb:\r\n    And he who feared the rule’s restraint\r\n    Finds but a friendly ministrant\r\n      In Reason’s helpmate, Rhyme.”\r\n\r\nPithy and pertinent too are Mr. Coventry Patmore’s lines on those who\r\n\r\n            “Live by law, not like the fool,\r\n      But like the bard, who freely sings\r\n    In strictest bonds of rhyme and rule,\r\n      And finds in them, not bonds, but wings.”\r\n\r\nThey who so live are in every sense the happier, without an “except\r\nthese bonds,” but because of them. They find in them not bonds, but\r\nwings; and thenceforth have free course, and go on their way rejoicing.\r\nThey, like the repentant rebels in Shakspeare’s “King John,” and by the\r\nsame river metaphor,\r\n\r\n    “Leaving their rankness and irregular course,\r\n    Stoop low within those bounds they had o’erlook’d,\r\n    And calmly run on in obedience.”\r\n\r\nWhat they are no longer free to do, is to do ill. And that freedom is\r\nas perfect servitude as the service of God is perfect freedom. In fine,\r\nand in the words (but expanding the meaning) of one of Samuel Butler’s\r\nmetrical reflections:—\r\n\r\n    “Law does not put the least restraint\r\n    Upon our freedom, but maintain’t;\r\n    Or if it does, ’tis for our good,\r\n    To give us freer latitude;\r\n    For wholesome laws preserve us free\r\n    By stinting of our liberty.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE DISCREET SILENCE OF FOLLY._\r\n\r\nPROVERBS xvii. 28.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is written among the Proverbs of Solomon, that “Even a fool, when he\r\nholdeth his peace, is counted wise.” Even the fool that shutteth his lips\r\nis esteemed a man of understanding. The wise king declares in another\r\nplace, that a fool’s mouth is his destruction, and that his lips are\r\nthe snare of his soul. Let him keep his mouth closed, and his folly is\r\nan unknown quantity; out of sight, out of mind. Let him keep his lips\r\nshut, and wisdom shall be imputed unto him. Of him lookers-on will say, a\r\ndiscreet man that. For they are only lookers-on, not listeners. To listen\r\nwould break the spell. As it is, they are apt to count him as deep as he\r\nis still. Do not still waters run deep?\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Browne—himself a silent man, but no fool; quite the other\r\nway—bids us, in one of his stately sentences, think not silence the\r\nwisdom of fools; but if rightly timed, the honour of wise men, who have\r\nnot the infirmity, but the virtue of taciturnity, and speak not out of\r\nthe abundance, but the well-weighed thoughts of the heart. “Such silence\r\nmay be eloquence, and speak thy worth above the power of words.” Would\r\nthe author of “Vulgar Errors,” however, have sanctioned for one moment\r\nthe reference of the proverb on reticent foolishness to that limbo?\r\nOn the contrary, the drift of his argument is wholly in favour of the\r\nproverb; for, if the silence of the wise is wisdom, as he contends, much\r\nmore is a tongue-tied condition expedient in the fool.\r\n\r\n_Stultitiam dissimulare non potes nisi taciturnitate_, says the Latin\r\nadage: there is no way to conceal folly but by holding your tongue.\r\n\r\nThere is something at once of pathos and almost of humorous reproach, in\r\nthe appeal of the Man of Uz, in his extremity, to his too didactic and\r\ncomplacently dogmatical friends: “Oh that ye would altogether hold your\r\npeace! and it should be your wisdom.”\r\n\r\nMontaigne exclaims, “To how many blockheads of my time has a cold and\r\ntaciturn demeanour procured the credit of prudence and capacity!” Note\r\nthe counsel of Carlo to Sogliardo, in one of Ben Jonson’s heaviest\r\ncomedies: “When anything is propounded above your capacity, smile at\r\nit, make two or three faces, and ’tis excellent; they’ll think you’ve\r\ntravelled; though you argue a whole day in silence thus, and discourse\r\nin nothing but laughter, ’twill pass.” Elsewhere rare Ben cites\r\napprovingly the “witty saying,” about one who was taken for a great and\r\nweighty man so long as he held his peace: “This man might have been a\r\ncounsellor of state, till he spoke; but having spoken, not the beadle\r\nof the ward.” Denouncing in his strong dialect the vapid verbiage of\r\nshallow praters, Mr. Carlyle exclaims, “Even Triviality, Imbecility,\r\nthat can sit silent, how respectable is it in comparison!” Michelet says\r\nof the Spanish grandees of Charles the Fifth’s time, that the haughty\r\nsilence they maintained, scarce deigning even a syllable of reply,\r\nserved them admirably to conceal their dearth of ideas. Silence and\r\nimperturbability, according to the author of “The Gentle Life,” are the\r\ntwo requisites for a man to get on in the world.\r\n\r\nIf there are two things not to be hidden—love and a cough—there is a\r\nthird, contends Nello, the barber of Florence, and that is ignorance,\r\nwhen once a man is obliged to do something besides wagging his head.\r\nCharles Lamb shrewdly observes that a man may do very well with a very\r\nlittle knowledge, and scarce be found out, in a mixed company; everybody\r\nbeing so much more ready to produce his own than to call for a display\r\nof your acquisitions. But in a _tête-à-tête_, he adds, there is no\r\nshuffling; the truth will out.\r\n\r\nThe Abbé de Choisy hugged himself on the success of a discreet silence\r\nduring his residence in Batavia, where he had special reasons to beware\r\nof committing, and of exposing, himself. “Often when I utter not a word,\r\nthey suppose it is because I don’t choose to talk; whereas the real\r\nmotive for my silence is a profound ignorance, such as it is best to\r\nkeep concealed from the gaze of mortals.” Molière’s sprightly chevalier,\r\nDorante, counsels a fatuous marquis not to talk of what he knows nothing\r\nat all about—bidding him hope that in virtue of a scrupulously observed\r\nsilence, he and the like of him may haply come to be regarded as clever\r\nfellows. “Et songez qu’en ne disant mot, on croira peut-être que vous\r\nêtes d’habiles gens.” A story is told of Zeuxis, how he reproved a\r\ncertain Megabyzus, high priest of great Diana of the Ephesians, who\r\ndiscoursed of pictures in the painter’s studio with so reckless an\r\naudacity of ignorance, that the very lads who were grinding colours\r\nthere could not refrain from giggling; whereupon quoth Zeuxis to his\r\ntoo-eloquent friend, “As long as you kept from talking, you were the\r\nadmiration of these boys, who were all wonder at your rich attire, and\r\nthe number of your servants; but now that you have ventured to expatiate\r\nupon the arts, of which you know simply nothing, they are laughing at\r\nyou outright.” Plutarch tells the same story of Apelles. Again to draw\r\nupon Molière: a fool who keeps his folly tongue-tied, is not to be\r\ndistinguished from a savant who hold his peace:\r\n\r\n    “Un sot qui ne dit mot ne se distingue pas\r\n    D’un savant qui se tait.”\r\n\r\nNot to be distinguished, possibly, from a savant who talks, and talks to\r\nthe purpose too.\r\n\r\nThere are two opposite ways, on Washington Irving’s showing, by which\r\nsome men get into notice—one by talking a vast deal and thinking a\r\nlittle, and the other by holding their tongues and not thinking at\r\nall. By the first, he says, many a vapouring, superficial pretender\r\nacquires the reputation of a man of quick parts; by the other, many a\r\nvacant dunder-pate, like the owl, the stupidest of birds, comes to be\r\ncomplimented, by a discerning world, with all the attributes of wisdom.\r\nSilent, quiet people, as Miss Jewsbury incidentally remarks, have a\r\ncharmed mystery about them which gives them a great advantage over more\r\ndemonstrative mortals; “nobody knows exactly what they think, nor the\r\nimpression made on them by anything; all within them has the prestige of\r\nan oracle; the extent of what they indicate is unknown; and what little\r\nis uttered goes so far.” The best, perhaps, as well as the best-known\r\nof all stories illustrative of our theme, is that of Coleridge admiring\r\na certain dinner-guest, so impregnable in his sublime reserve, so\r\ninexorably proof against every temptation to join in the table-talk, such\r\na model (in appearance) of dignified superiority—until there was carried\r\nin that unlucky dish of apple-dumplings, the very first glance at which\r\nroused Sir Oracle to the enthusiastic outburst, “Them are the jockeys for\r\nme!” Goldsmith had, long before, recorded a somewhat parallel passage\r\nof disenchantment. His travelled Chinese, Lien Chi Altangi, is present\r\nat a dinner-party of dignitaries and dons in whose company and from\r\nwhose converse he expects to find a feast of reason as well as turtle,\r\nand a flow of soul as well as claret. Their silence before dinner is\r\nserved, rather puzzles and disappoints the eager expectant; who, however,\r\naccounts for and excuses it by the reflection, that men of wisdom are\r\never slow of speech, and deliver nothing unadvisedly. “Silence,” says\r\nConfucius, “is a friend that will never betray.” The dons and dignitaries\r\nwere now by the mandarin’s surmise, inventing maxims, or hard sayings,\r\nfor their mutual instruction, when some one should think proper to begin.\r\n“My curiosity was now wrought up to the highest pitch; I impatiently\r\nlooked round to see if any were going to interrupt the mighty pause;\r\nwhen at last one of the company declared that there was a sow in his\r\nneighbourhood that farrowed fifteen pigs at a litter.” Broken at once was\r\nthe spell, and disillusion was the Chinaman’s doom.\r\n\r\nPope, being satirist of the first class, as well as poet of (say) the\r\nsecond, took care, in his imitative stanzas on Silence, not to be all\r\nsentiment and rhapsodical rapture on that subject. Hence, one or his\r\nstanzas begins, “Silence, the knave’s repute;” and another declares\r\nDulness to be her bosom-friend:\r\n\r\n    “And in thy bosom lurks in Thought’s disguise;\r\n    Thou varnisher of fools, and cheat of all the wise.”\r\n\r\nThe moral of one of Gay’s fables is to the purpose—that one, namely, in\r\nwhich a young dog, ignorant of game, gives tongue as lustily as if he\r\nknew all about it, and gets well lashed for his pains. To the astounded\r\npuppy’s remonstrance the whip-bearing huntsman replies:—\r\n\r\n    “Had not thy forward noisy tongue\r\n    Proclaim’d thee always in the wrong,\r\n    Thou might’st have mingled with the rest,\r\n    And ne’er thy foolish nose confess’d;\r\n    But fools, to talking ever prone,\r\n    Are sure to make their follies known.”\r\n\r\nSo a French satirist of the last century bids _le sot_ remember, that by\r\nsimply holding his tongue, he will acquire not a little respect—hopeless\r\nas the reminder in such a case may be; for you might as well counsel the\r\ncoward not to tremble, as the fool not to expose himself in words, words,\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n    “Souvenez-vous qu’un sot doit garder le silence,\r\n    Il serait respecté beaucoup plus qu’il ne pense;\r\n    Mais vouloir le contraindre à ne jamais parler,\r\n    C’est, sans espoir, défendre au poltron ne trembler.”\r\n\r\nCould it but be enforced, the one injunction to be laid upon the fool\r\nmight be condensed into an applied line from Molière, where Orgon bids\r\nDorine hold her tongue, and regard that as a standing order:—\r\n\r\n    “Taisez-vous. C’est le mot qu’il vous faut toujours dire.”\r\n\r\nAll silent people, Lord Lytton affirms, can seem conventionally elegant.\r\nAnd he tells the story of a groom married to a rich lady, and in\r\nconsequent trepidation as to the probability of being ridiculed by the\r\nguests in his new home and her old one, to whom an Oxford clergyman\r\ngave this bit of advice: “Wear a black coat, and hold your tongue.” The\r\ngroom took the hint, and, we are assured, was always considered the\r\nmost gentlemanly man in the county. Elsewhere, again, the same author\r\nrelates his meeting with a diplomatist of weighty name, a stock example\r\nof political success, but of whom he could make nothing whatever, except\r\nindeed that he was a preposterous numskull. When, therefore, the Prime\r\nMinister, some days later, spoke to our author of this “superior man,” he\r\ngot for a reply, “Well, I don’t think much of him. I spent the other day\r\nwith him, and found him insufferably dull.” “Indeed!” said the minister,\r\nwith something of horror in his tone; “why then, I see how it is. Lord\r\n⸺ has been positively talking to you!” Had he but altogether held his\r\npeace, it had been his wisdom.\r\n\r\nAccording to La Bruyère, everything tells in favour of the man who talks\r\nbut little; the presumption is that he is a superior man; and if, in\r\npoint of fact, he is not a sheer blockhead, the presumption then is\r\nthat he is very superior indeed. His comparative freedom from folly is\r\npositively presumed to exist in the superlative degree. In another place\r\nthe same observant philosopher describes in his best style the sort of\r\npeople who, by a grand talent for silence, win golden opinions from all\r\nsorts of men; they look wise, and now and then enforce and re-enforce\r\nthe look by a timely shrug of the shoulders, or significant shake of the\r\nhead; but the assumed depth of wisdom don’t really go two inches down;\r\nscratch the surface, and you come to the bottom at once.\r\n\r\nFor, as Shakspeare has it,\r\n\r\n    “There are a sort of men whose visages\r\n    Do cream and mantle like a standing pond;\r\n    And do a wilful stillness entertain,\r\n    With purpose to be dress’d in an opinion\r\n    Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit.\r\n    ...\r\n    O, my Antonio, I do know of those,\r\n    That therefore only are reputed wise,\r\n    For saying nothing; who, I am very sure,\r\n    If they should speak, would⸺”\r\n\r\n_not_ be reputed wise, but the uttermost opposite, whatever that may be\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_PENAL PREVISION._\r\n\r\n1 SAMUEL xxvii. 19, 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy had Saul disquieted Samuel, to bring him up from the place of the\r\ndead, by the midnight agency of the “wise woman” of Endor? Because he\r\nwould fain pry into futurity, and learn from supernatural sources his\r\ncoming fate. The desired foresight was vouchsafed him. By to-morrow he\r\nand his sons were to be with the dead-and-gone seer, whose spirit he had\r\nrashly invoked. The prevision had its present penalty. “Then Saul fell\r\nstraightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the\r\nwords of Samuel.” The secret things belong unto the Lord our God, and\r\nonly those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children.\r\nThe tree of foreknowledge of good and evil may offer fruit that is\r\npleasant to the sight, and seemingly to be desired to make one wise; but\r\nit is fatal food, not to be eaten of, nor to be touched, by any but the\r\nventuresome profane.\r\n\r\nIndulged to his cost with previsions of what should befall his posterity,\r\nMilton’s Adam, at sight of the Flood and its ravages, breaks out into the\r\nexclamation,\r\n\r\n    “O visions ill foreseen! Better had I\r\n    Lived ignorant of future! so had borne\r\n    My part of evil only, each day’s lot\r\n    Enough to bear.”\r\n\r\nWarned by so distressful an experience, he would have no man seek\r\nhenceforth to be foretold what shall befall him or his children; “evil he\r\nmay be sure, which neither his foreknowing can prevent; and he the future\r\nevil shall, no less in apprehension than in substance, feel grievous to\r\nbear.” It has been asked what would become of men, were their future\r\nabsolutely foreknown by them: would they not become in imagination, and\r\ntherefore in reality, the passive slaves of an inevitable fate, with all\r\nhope extinguished, all fear intensified, awaiting in terror the foreseen\r\nevil, and looking with indifference on the promised good, darkened as it\r\nwould be by the shadow of intervening calamities, and stripped of the\r\nbright colouring of hope? And yet,\r\n\r\n    “With eager search to dart the soul,\r\n    Curiously vain, from pole to pole,\r\n    And from the planets’ wandering spheres\r\n    To extort the number of our years,\r\n    And whether all those years shall flow\r\n    Serenely smooth, and free from woe,\r\n    Or rude misfortune shall deform\r\n    Our life with one continual storm;\r\n    Or if the scene shall motley be\r\n    Alternate joy and misery,—\r\n    Is a desire which, more or less,\r\n    All men feel, though few confess.”\r\n\r\nSo at least affirms the author of the “Rosciad,”—who in another of his\r\nwritings puts the query:\r\n\r\n    “Tell me, philosopher, is it a crime\r\n    To pry into the secret womb of time;\r\n    Or, born in ignorance, must we despair\r\n    To reach events, and read the future there?”\r\n\r\nAssuredly, says Cicero, the ignorance of evils to come is of more\r\nadvantage than the knowledge of them: _certe ignoratio futurorum malorum\r\nutilior est quam scientia_. And Horace, in a celebrated passage:\r\n\r\n    “Prudens futuri temporis exitum\r\n    Caliginosâ nocte premit Deus:\r\n      Ridetque, si mortalis ultra\r\n          Fas trepidat.”...\r\n\r\n_Caliginosa nox_ forms a thick black curtain.\r\n\r\n    “What hangs behind that curtain?—would’st thou learn?\r\n    If thou art wise, thou would’st not.”\r\n\r\nA thoughtful mind, sententiously observes Miss Clarissa Harlowe, is not\r\na blessing to be coveted, unless it has such a happy vivacity with it\r\nas her friend Miss Howe’s: a vivacity which enables one to enjoy the\r\npresent, without being anxious about the future. It is, according to\r\nGoldsmith, the happy confidence in bright illusions that gives life\r\nits true relish, and keeps up our spirits amidst every distress and\r\ndisappointment. “How much less would be done, if a man knew how little he\r\ncan do! How wretched a creature would he be, if he saw the end as well\r\nas the beginning of his projects! He would have nothing left but to sit\r\ndown in torpid despair, and exchange enjoyment for actual calamity.” The\r\nwarrior in Mr. Roscoe’s tragedy argues judiciously when he says,\r\n\r\n    “What is’t to me, that I should vex my soul\r\n    In dim forebodings of what is to be?\r\n    It is enough I know, and ache to know,\r\n    What on this bridge of time I have to do,\r\n    Not overlook the abysm till my head fail.”\r\n\r\nFortunately for us mortals, Mr. Froude says, necessary as any future\r\nmay be, and inevitable as by our own actions we may have made it, it is\r\nkindly kept from us wrapt up in clouds, and we are not made wretched\r\nabout it by anticipation. “O my fortune,” prays Agrippina, in one of\r\nJonson’s Roman tragedies, “let it be sudden thou preparest against me;\r\nstrike all my powers of understanding blind, and ignorant of destiny to\r\ncome!”\r\n\r\nSeek to know no more, is in vain the joint appeal of the three witches\r\nto Macbeth, beside the magic caldron in the cave; but as to the future\r\nof Banquo’s issue he _will_ be satisfied. Cranmer, predicting a glorious\r\nreign for the infant Elizabeth, parenthesises a sigh on the common lot—\r\n\r\n    “Would I had known no more! but she must die.”\r\n\r\nShakspeare’s King Henry the Fourth, again, in one place utters the\r\naspiration, “O Heaven! that one might read the book of fate!” Hardly an\r\naspiration, however, as the context shows; a privilege to be deprecated\r\nrather; for could there be foreseen all the changes and chances of one’s\r\nmortal life, “how chances mock, and changes fill the cup of alteration\r\nwith divers liquors,”\r\n\r\n                    “O, if this were seen,\r\n    The happiest youth,—viewing his progress through,\r\n    What perils past, what crosses to ensue,—\r\n    Would shut the book, and sit him down and die.”\r\n\r\nMr. de Quincey describes an Installation of the Knights of St. Patrick at\r\nwhich he was present, during the Lord-Lieutenancy of Lord Cornwallis—the\r\nnarrator’s companions on that occasion being Lord and Lady Castlereagh,\r\nwho “were both young at this time, and both wore an impressive appearance\r\nof youthful happiness; neither, happily for their peace of mind, able to\r\npierce that cloud of years, not much more than twenty, which divided them\r\nfrom the day destined in one hour to wreck the happiness of both.” Vision\r\nill foreseen it were to know the times and the seasons, the manner how,\r\nand the place where.\r\n\r\n    “O tell me, cried Ereenia, for from thee\r\n    Nought can be hidden, when the end will be.\r\n      Seek not to know, old Casyapa replied,\r\n        What pleaseth Heaven to hide.\r\n          Dark is the abyss of Time.\r\n    But light enough to guide your steps is given;\r\n        Whatever weal or woe betide,\r\n      Turn never from the way of truth aside,\r\n    And leave the event, in holy hope, to Heaven.”\r\n\r\nThe hermit in Scott’s “Talisman,” who, after failing to read aright the\r\nfate of others, has to own himself uncertain whether he may not have\r\nmiscalculated his own,—withdraws from the action of the story with the\r\nreflection that God will not have us break into His council-house, or\r\nspy out His hidden mysteries. “We must wait His time with watching and\r\nprayer—with fear and with hope. I came hither the stern seer—the proud\r\nprophet, skilled, as I thought, to instruct princes, and gifted even\r\nwith supernatural powers, but burdened with a weight which I deemed no\r\nshoulders but mine could have borne. But my bands have been broken! I go\r\nhence humble in mine ignorance,” etc. In Scott’s other and less popular\r\nTale of the Crusaders, Eveline deprecates the Lady of Baldringham’s\r\noffer to show her niece how the balance of fate inclines, and shrinks\r\nfrom the asserted privilege “enjoyed” by their house of looking forward\r\nbeyond the points of present time, and seeing in the very bud the thorns\r\nor flowers which are one day to encircle their head. “For my own sake,\r\nnoble kinswoman,” answered Eveline, “I would decline such foreknowledge,\r\neven were it possible to acquire it without transgressing the rules of\r\nthe Church. Could I have foreseen what has befallen me within these last\r\nunhappy days, I had lost the enjoyment of every happy moment before that\r\ntime.” So again reasons the Italian adept, Baptista Damiotti, in one of\r\nSir Walter’s shorter tales, when dismissing the two agitated ladies who\r\nhave been consulting his magic mirror. “Few,” he added, in a melancholy\r\ntone, “leave this house as well in health as they entered it. Such being\r\nthe consequence of seeking knowledge by mysterious means, I leave you\r\nto judge of the condition of those who have the power of gratifying\r\nsuch irregular curiosity.” Cowper observes in one of his letters that\r\nman often prophesies without knowing it; but that did he foresee, what\r\nis always foreseen by him who dictates what he supposes to be his own,\r\nhe would suffer by anticipation as well as by consequence; and wish\r\nperhaps as ardently for the happy ignorance to which he is at present so\r\nmuch indebted, as some have foolishly and inconsiderately done, for a\r\nknowledge that would be but another name for misery. Even in the ecstasy\r\nof rapturous foresight the Seer exclaims,\r\n\r\n    “Visions of glory, spare my aching sight,\r\n    Ye unborn ages, crowd not on my soul!”\r\n\r\nWhen Harold and Haco, “pale king and dark youth,” in Lord Lytton’s\r\nhistorical novel, would read the riddle of the future, and “climb\r\nto heaven through the mysteries of hell,” the witch bids them—poor\r\n“worms”—crawl back to the clay—to the earth: “One such night as the hag\r\nye despise enjoys as her sport and her glee, would freeze your veins, and\r\nsear the life in your eyeballs,” etc., etc. What says the wizard, again,\r\nin Tasso?\r\n\r\n    “But that I should the sure events unfold\r\n      Of things to come, or destinies foretel,\r\n    Too rash is your desire, your wish too bold.”\r\n\r\nCagliostro, professing to foresee the fate of La Perouse, is\r\nimportunately asked by his fellow-guests at that memorable dinner-party\r\ncommemorated by M. Dumas, why then he did not forewarn and save that\r\nbrave man before setting out. At the very least, why not have told him to\r\n“beware of unknown isles”—that he might at any rate have had the chance\r\nof avoiding them? But, “I assure you no, count,” is the mystic’s reply;\r\n“and, if he had believed me, it would only have been the more horrible,\r\nfor the unfortunate man would have seen himself approaching those isles\r\ndestined to be fatal to him, without the power to escape from them.\r\nTherefore he would have died, not one, but a hundred deaths, for he would\r\nhave gone through it all by anticipation. Hope, of which I should have\r\ndeprived him, is what best sustains a man under all trials.” “Yes,” says\r\nCondorcet, the sceptical and sententious, “the veil which hides from us\r\nour future, is the only real good which God has vouchsafed to man.” And\r\nwhat again, to the same purport, says the Hermit Monk to Alpine’s Lord:—\r\n\r\n    “Roderick, it is a fearful strife\r\n    For man endowed with mortal life,\r\n    Whose shroud of sentient clay can still\r\n    Feel feverish pang and fainting chill, ...\r\n    ’Tis hard for such to view, unfurl’d,\r\n    The curtain of the future world.\r\n    Yet witness every quaking limb,\r\n    My sunken pulse, mine eyeballs dim,\r\n    My soul with harrowing anguish torn,—\r\n    This for my chieftain have I borne!”\r\n\r\nAnd therefore, says Sir Thomas Browne, in his moralisings on the\r\nundesirableness of all such foresight, “and therefore the wisdom of\r\nastrologers, who speak of future things, hath wisely softened the\r\nseverity of their doctrines; and even in their sad predictions, while\r\nthey tell us of inclination not coaction from the stars, they kill us\r\nnot with Stygian oaths and merciless necessity, but leave us hopes of\r\nevasion.” _Tant mieux_ for those who, like Hudibras,\r\n\r\n          ... “still gape to anticipate\r\n    The cabinet-designs of fate,\r\n    Apply to wizards to foresee\r\n    What shall, and what shall never be;”\r\n\r\nlike Hudibras, bursting with the wish,\r\n\r\n    “Oh, that I could enucleate\r\n    And solve the problem of my fate;\r\n    Or find, by necromantic art,\r\n    How far the destinies take my part!”\r\n\r\nVanity and vexation of spirit, these visionary previsions all. Sacred,\r\ntherefore, be, in Thomson’s phrase, the veil that kindly clouds a light\r\ntoo keen for mortals,\r\n\r\n        ... “for those that here in dust\r\n    Must cheerful toil out their appointed years.”\r\n\r\nIn a feeling paragraph on the pains of a first separation, Miss Ferrier\r\nobserves, or rather asks, if in the long and dreary interval that ensues,\r\nit were foreseen what griefs were to be borne, what ties severed, what\r\nhearts seared or broken—“who of woman born could bear the sight and live?\r\nBut ’tis in mercy these things are hidden from our eyes.” Looking back\r\nupon a certain year’s accumulated troubles, Mrs. Gaskell’s Margaret Hale\r\n“wondered how they had been borne. If she could have anticipated them,\r\nhow she would have shrunk away and hid herself from the coming time!” And\r\nyet day by day, it is explained, had of itself, and by itself, been very\r\nendurable—small, keen, bright little spots of positive enjoyment having\r\ncome sparkling into the very middle of sorrows. Margaret Hale does but\r\nexemplify in prose what Home’s Lady Randolph enunciates in sonorous verse:\r\n\r\n    “Had some good angel oped to me the book\r\n    Of Providence, and let me read my life,\r\n    My heart had broke when I beheld the sum\r\n    Of ills which one by one I have endured.”\r\n\r\nWhereupon the lady’s faithful Anna remarks:\r\n\r\n    “That God, whose ministers good angels are,\r\n    Hath shut the book, in mercy to mankind.”\r\n\r\nNot but that this doctrine has found special recusants, if too generally\r\ntaken, or, in their own instance, too particularly applied. “I have\r\nsomewhere read,” says Caleb Williams, “that Heaven in mercy hides from us\r\nthe future incidents of our life. My own experience does not well accord\r\nwith this assertion.” And mentioning one critical occasion, he adds,\r\nthat this once at least he should have been saved from insupportable\r\nlabour and indescribable anguish, could he have foreseen what was then\r\nimpending.—Sometimes the natural complaint is like that of Duke Ferdinand\r\nin John Webster’s tragedy:\r\n\r\n    “Oh, most imperfect light of human reason,\r\n    That mak’st us so unhappy to foresee\r\n    What we can least prevent!”\r\n\r\nSometimes a solace is found in such a reflection as this:\r\n\r\n    “Then did I see how that presentient shroud\r\n    Of grief, which raiseth many a fond complaint\r\n    In mortal bosoms, is a friendly cloud.\r\n    Storms fall less heavily which men fore-paint.\r\n    And the struck spirit utterly would faint,\r\n    Hurl’d from full joy.”\r\n\r\nTo be ignorant of evils to come, as well as forgetful of past, Sir Thomas\r\nBrowne hails as a merciful provision of nature, “whereby we digest the\r\nmixture of our few and evil days.” In another of his works the fine old\r\nphysician would have us, in the heyday of prosperity, “think of sullen\r\nvicissitudes,” but beat not our brains to foreknow them. “Be armed\r\nagainst such obscurities, rather by submission than fore-knowledge. The\r\nknowledge of future evils modifies present felicities, and there is more\r\ncontent in the uncertainty or ignorance of them. This favour our Saviour\r\nvouchsafed unto Peter, when he foretold not his death in plain terms,\r\nand so by an ambiguous and cloudy delivery damped not the spirit of His\r\ndisciples. But in the assured fore-knowledge of the deluge, Noah lived\r\nmany years under the affliction of a flood, and Jerusalem was taken unto\r\nJeremy before it was besieged.” Holy George Herbert is scarcely more\r\nquaint in verse than Sir Thomas Browne in prose:\r\n\r\n    “Only the present is thy part and fee.\r\n              And happy thou,\r\n    If, though thou didst not beat thy future brow,\r\n              Thou couldst well see\r\n          What present things required of thee.\r\n\r\n    They ask enough; why shouldst thou further go?\r\n              Raise not the mud\r\n    Of future depths, but drink the clear and good.\r\n              Dig not for woe\r\n          In times to come; for it will grow.\r\n\r\n    Man and the present fit; if he _provide_\r\n              He breaks the square.\r\n    This hour is mine: if for the next I care,\r\n              I grow too wide,\r\n          And do crusade upon death’s side:\r\n\r\n    For death each hour environs and surrounds.\r\n              He that would know\r\n    And care for future chances, cannot go\r\n              Unto those grounds,\r\n          But thro’ a churchyard which them bounds.”\r\n\r\nThe assured knowledge of the exact minute of one’s death may be treated\r\nreligiously as a privilege, after the manner of appeals by gaol-chaplains\r\nto condemned-cell criminals; as where the clergyman of the Tolbooth\r\nChurch bade Wilson and Robertson, convicted Porteous rioters, not despair\r\non account of the suddenness of the summons, “but rather to feel this\r\ncomfort in their misery, that, though all who now [in that church] lifted\r\nthe voice, or bent the knee in conjunction with them, lay under the\r\nsame sentence of certain death, _they_ only had the advantage of knowing\r\nthe precise moment at which it should be executed upon them.” But how\r\ndoes Professor Henry Rogers treat the question, in its practical aspect,\r\nin his so-called “Vision about Prevision”? The seer, or foreseer, in\r\nthat _fantasiestück_, when asked, concerning those who consult him as\r\nto the future, whether some at least do not wish to know the hour of\r\ntheir death—that they may duly prepare for it? answers, “That least of\r\nall. Not a soul will hear his tale told to the end; they won’t let us\r\nunveil to them the hour or the mode of their dissolution.... They prefer\r\nhaving a veil thrown over the closing scene of their life. Like other\r\nplay-goers, they do not like death to be actually exhibited on the stage,\r\nand willingly let the curtain fall ere the catastrophe.” Well, but the\r\nseer himself: he at any rate is above that weakness: he at any rate has\r\ninquired into the secret of his end? “For what purpose?” is his reply:\r\nis not that knowledge the very misery of prisoners in the condemned\r\ncell? are they not accounted miserable precisely because they are to\r\ndie just that day month? will not hundreds, who pity them for that very\r\ncircumstance, in fact die before them? and yet are not these accounted\r\nhappy in comparison, because they know it not?\r\n\r\n    “E’en the great shadow, Death, lost half its gloom\r\n    In kind oblivion of impending doom,”\r\n\r\nsays one philosophical poet. Another, and a greater, in a poem on\r\npresentiments, has this among many stanzas addressed to them:\r\n\r\n    “’Tis said, that warnings ye dispense,\r\n    Emboldened by a keener sense;\r\n      That men have lived for whom,\r\n    With dread precision, ye made clear\r\n    The hour that in a distant year\r\n      Should knell them to the tomb.\r\n    Unwelcome insight!”⸺\r\n\r\n_that_ is the comment, that the note of exclamation, with which\r\nWordsworth commences the stanza next ensuing. When death has invaded the\r\nquiet rectory in Miss Tytler’s Huguenot story, we have each servant\r\nmysteriously and fanatically delivering her experience in the matter of\r\ncorpse-candles, death-spells, death-watches, etc., so that one might have\r\nlearned for all one’s life afterwards to look on one’s death as a dark\r\nfate, haunting and hovering over one’s own person and those of beloved\r\nfriends, from which there is no escape, not even by prayer and fasting;\r\nmight have learned to “look out for it in dim prognostications, to\r\nwatch for it, and anticipate its cruel blows in incipient madness.—‘Our\r\nBibles say we know not the day nor the hour,’ said Grand’mère; ‘but He\r\nknows—that is enough.’” One of La Bruyère’s _pensées sur la mort_ is,\r\nthat “ce qu’il y a de certain dans la mort, est un peu adouci par ce qui\r\nest incertain: c’est un indéfini dans le tems, qui tient quelque chose\r\nde l’infini, et de ce qu’on appelle éternité.” Byron indeed utters the\r\nremonstrant query,\r\n\r\n    “Ah! why do darkening shades conceal\r\n    The hour when man must cease to be?”\r\n\r\nBut his sigh was little in the spirit of the Psalmist’s prayer to be made\r\nto know his end, and the measure of his days, what it was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_BEATIFIC VISION AND OVERSHADOWING CLOUD._\r\n\r\nST. LUKE ix. 34.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the three favoured apostles it was granted by their Master to be\r\neye-witnesses of His majesty, when they were with Him on the holy\r\nmount. They saw the fashion of His countenance altered, and His raiment\r\nbecome white and glistering. They saw with Him in glory Moses, whose\r\nburial-place no man knew, and Elijah, who was translated that he should\r\nnot see death. And Peter said it was good to be there, and he desired\r\nto make that mount of transfiguration a dwelling-place, and to prolong\r\nthe splendours of that beatific vision. Three tabernacles he proposed to\r\nrear, in that eager impetuosity which so often marked his character;\r\nat present scarcely knowing what he said, but conscious of a privileged\r\napocalypse, and deprecating its speedy withdrawal. But “while he thus\r\nspake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them; and they feared as they\r\nentered into the cloud.”\r\n\r\nSo it was again at a later day, and upon another mount, when the risen\r\nMaster was asked by His assembled apostles would He at this time restore\r\nagain the kingdom to Israel? Brief was the reply, and no sooner uttered\r\nthan, while they beheld—gazed wistfully, hopingly, longingly, on the\r\nPresence they had so lately lost, and were now eager to retain—while they\r\nbeheld, “He was taken up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe overshadowing cloud to mar the sunshine is one of the commonest of\r\ncommon-places in man’s experience. Perpetually being verified in prosaic\r\nreality, all too real, is the poet’s image—\r\n\r\n    “Across the sunbeam, with a sudden gloom,\r\n    A ghostly shadow flitted,”\r\n\r\n_Medio de fonte leporum surgit amari aliquid._ The very exuberance of\r\nhuman happiness tends to suggest its opposite.\r\n\r\nGibbon felt simply as a man when he felt what he has described in a\r\nmemorable passage relating to his sense of gratified triumph at the\r\nconclusion of his _magnum opus_. It was between the hours of eleven and\r\ntwelve, he records, on a calm night in June, that he wrote the last lines\r\nof his last page in a summer-house in his garden at Lausanne. After\r\nlaying down his pen, he took several turns in a covered walk of acacias,\r\nwhich commanded a prospect of the country, the lake, and the mountains.\r\nThe air was temperate, the sky was serene, the silver orb of the moon\r\nwas reflected from the waters, and all nature was silent. “I will not\r\ndissemble the first emotions of joy on the recovery of my freedom, and,\r\nperhaps, the establishment of my fame. But my pride was soon humbled,\r\nand a sober melancholy was spread over my mind, by the idea that I had\r\ntaken an everlasting leave of an old and agreeable companion, and\r\nthat whatsoever might be the future date of my history the life of the\r\nhistorian must be short and precarious.” It is the common lot. It is but\r\nanother reading of the complaint in Prior’s pastorals—\r\n\r\n    “Yet thus beloved, thus loving to excess,\r\n    Yet thus receiving and returning bliss,\r\n    In this great moment, in this golden Now,\r\n    ...\r\n    A melancholy tear afflicts my eye,\r\n    And my heart labours with a sudden sigh;\r\n    Invading fears repel my coward joy,\r\n    And ills foreseen the present bliss destroy.”\r\n\r\nOr as elsewhere the same poet gloomily exclaims, and fruitlessly\r\nsupplicates—\r\n\r\n    “O impotent estate of human life,\r\n    Where hope and fear maintain eternal strife!\r\n    Where fleeting joy does lasting doubt inspire,\r\n    And most we question what we most desire!\r\n    Amongst Thy various gifts, great Heaven, bestow\r\n    Our cup of love unmixed; forbear to throw\r\n    Bitter ingredients in; nor pall the draught\r\n    With nauseous grief.”\r\n\r\nHardly can it be called, though the author of “The Ring and the Book”\r\ndoes call it,—\r\n\r\n          ... “strange how, even when most secure\r\n    In our domestic peace, a certain dim\r\n    And flitting shade can sadden all; it seems\r\n    A restlessness of heart, a silent yearning,\r\n    A sense of something wanting, incomplete.”\r\n\r\nA thought comes over us sometimes in our career of pleasure, Lord Lytton\r\nremarks, or in the exultation of our ambitious pursuits, a thought comes\r\nover us like a cloud, that around us and about us Death, Shame, Crime,\r\nDespair, are busy at their work. He tells us what he has read somewhere\r\nof an enchanted land where the inmates walked along voluptuous gardens,\r\nand built palaces, and heard music, and made merry; while around and\r\nwithin the land were deep caverns, where the gnomes and the fiends dwelt;\r\nand ever and anon their groans and laughter, and the sounds of their\r\nunutterable toils or ghastly revels, travelled to the upper air, mixing\r\nin an awful strangeness with the summer festivity and buoyant occupation\r\nof those above. And this he claims to be a picture of human life.\r\n\r\nAlways there is a black spot in our sunshine, exclaims Mr. Carlyle; and\r\nhe tells us what it is, “the shadow of ourselves.”\r\n\r\nAt a seeming crisis of assured prosperity the heroine of a French _roman_\r\nis made to exclaim, “The future is all our own—the radiant future,\r\nwithout cloud or obstacle, pure in the immensity of its horizon, and\r\nextending beyond the reach of sight.” But while she thus speaks her\r\nfeatures suddenly assume an expression of touching melancholy, as she\r\nadds, in a voice of profound emotion, “And yet—at this very hour—so many\r\nunfortunate creatures are suffering pain!” So with the young hero in one\r\nof Mr. Hannay’s fictions: “In that moment he felt that he had attained\r\na new stage of life; yet, an instant’s reaction seized him, as in every\r\nfruition through one’s progress in time comes that curious moment’s\r\nspeck, the touch of an unseen hand, that seems to tell you, ‘Too much\r\njoy is not for you here.’ It passed away, having just dashed his triumph\r\nas it always does.” At a later stage in this adventurer’s career the ebb\r\nof his spirits is made the text of a paragraph comparing them to a ship\r\nin the tropics, where a light wind comes, and dies again, and leaves you\r\nbecalmed, or the horizon blackens suddenly and death seems impending\r\nin the unhealthy air. “Few things are more touching than that peculiar\r\nmelancholy which sometimes comes over one in theatres or at feasts, and\r\nreminds us of the dark element in nature and the heart ... which chills\r\nthe philosopher and the pleasure-taker.... When the light southerner of\r\nold got a glimpse of it he called for his lyre and his garlands; but\r\nroses will not charm it away from the deep heart of the child of the\r\nTeuton, and he sees its awful shadow trembling in the wine.” The English\r\nOpium-eater somewhere professes to derive from the spectacle of dancing,\r\nwhere the motion is continuous and the music not of a trivial character\r\nbut charged with the spirit of festal pleasure, “the very grandest form\r\nof passionate sadness which can belong to any spectacle whatever.”\r\nWordsworth is treating of presentiments when he says that—\r\n\r\n    “The laughter of the Christmas hearth\r\n    With sighs of self-exhausted mirth\r\n      They feelingly reprove.”\r\n\r\nAnd of such is Currer Bell too treating in a passage that tells of the\r\nwriter’s fancy budding fresh and her heart basking in sunshine; only\r\nthese feelings “were well kept in check by the secret but ceaseless\r\nconsciousness of anxiety lying in wait on enjoyment, like a tiger\r\ncrouched in a jungle. The breathing of that beast of prey was in my ear\r\nalways.” Ἐξ ἡδονῆς γὰρ φύεται τὸ δυστυχεῖν.\r\n\r\n    “Who knows what that low sullen murmur means,\r\n    The river’s fall sends up to blast life’s fairest scenes?”\r\n\r\nThe happiest, as Pope’s Homer has it, “taste not happiness sincere,\r\nbut find the cordial draught is dashed with care.” What biography of\r\nsuccessful ambition but has its parallel passage to one in Prescott’s\r\nhistory of the conqueror of Peru: “Amidst this burst of adulation the cup\r\nof joy commended to Pizarro’s lips had one drop of bitterness in it that\r\ngave its flavour to all the rest”! As M. Ampére’s Cleopatra owns,—\r\n\r\n    “Oui, parmi les plaisirs, la joie et les festins,\r\n    Je médite du sort les arrêts incertains.”\r\n\r\nHow apt, at a bright banquet, is the thought of death to flash across the\r\nmind, is trite among the truisms of experience. It was at Belshazzar’s\r\nfeast, while they drank wine out of the golden vessels of the temple, and\r\npraised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and\r\nof stone, when the revelry was at its height and the revellers at their\r\nbest, that in the same hour there came forth fingers of a man’s hand,\r\nand wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of\r\nthe king’s palace; and then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and\r\nhis countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astounded. In\r\nHawthorne’s allegory of the Maypole at Merry Mount, the lord and lady\r\nof the May are abruptly overcome with a shadow of sadness, just when\r\nthe minstrelsy of pipe, cittern, and viola is pealing forth in such a\r\nmirthful cadence that the boughs of the maypole quiver to the sound;\r\nand just then too, as if a spell had loosened them, down comes a little\r\nshower of withering roseleaves from the maypole. There is sometimes, says\r\nFielding, a little speck of black in the brightest and gayest colours of\r\nfortune, which contaminates and deadens the whole.\r\n\r\n    “In every joy there lurks\r\n      An impulse of decay;\r\n    With silent speed it works,\r\n      While all without is gay:”\r\n\r\n—with silent speed, like the worm at Jonah’s gourd. “Fleurs, vous aussi,”\r\nso Béranger apostrophizes them,\r\n\r\n          ... “vous avez vos souffrances.\r\n    Le ver est là; le vent peut accourir.”\r\n\r\n_Le ver_, as the worm prepared for Jonah’s gourd; _le vent_, as the\r\nvehement east wind to wither Jonah’s strength.\r\n\r\n    “While blooming love assures us golden fruit,\r\n    Some inborn poison taints the secret root;\r\n    Soon fall the flowers of joy.”\r\n\r\nBut Jonah’s gourd must have a section apart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE SPREADING GOURD AND THE SPEEDING WORM._\r\n\r\nJONAH iv. 6-8.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Elijah the Tishbite sat down in the wilderness under a juniper-tree,\r\nheavy-hearted, and fleeing for his life from the grasp of Jezebel, yet\r\nrequesting for himself that he might die; as he said, “It is enough; now,\r\nO Lord, take away my life,” yet anon found rest and refreshment under\r\nthe juniper-tree, and did eat and drink, and lay down again, and went\r\nin the strength of that rest and that meat, forty days and forty nights,\r\nunto Horeb the mount of God; so Jonah the son of Amittai, displeased\r\nexceedingly, and very angry, prayed in bitterness the same prayer, “O\r\nLord, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to\r\ndie than to live.” Did he well to be angry? Did Elijah well to despair?\r\nUnder a juniper-tree Elijah recovered strength, took heart, and became of\r\ngood courage. For Jonah there was preparing a gourd. A gourd; and a worm\r\nto make short work of the gourd.\r\n\r\nJonah left the city in wrath, and made him a booth, and sat under it in\r\nthe shadow, till he might see what would become of the city—the city\r\nwhich he had doomed and God had spared. Under the burning sun he awaited\r\nthe judgment of Nineveh. “And the Lord God prepared a gourd, and made\r\nit to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to\r\ndeliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.\r\n\r\n“But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote\r\nthe gourd that it withered.”\r\n\r\nAnd when the sun arose, there arose too another thing of God’s preparing.\r\nAs He had prepared the gourd, and prepared the worm to smite the gourd,\r\nso, at sunrise, “God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon\r\nthe head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die.” And\r\nnot only so, but again expressed the wish, with the old bitterness and\r\neven increasing wrath. Did he well to be angry for the gourd? “I do well\r\nto be angry, even unto death,” he exclaimed. The gourd was so gladdening\r\na creation, it made even that morose spirit exceeding glad. But scarcely\r\nhad he time to congratulate himself on this relief, in complacent\r\nassurance of its continuance, when the sheltering gourd was eaten to the\r\nheart by a speeding worm, and what came up in a night, perished in a\r\nnight; and this also was vanity, vanity and vexation of spirit.\r\n\r\nA perverse fate seems to lie in wait for man,\r\n\r\n    “And though he in a fertile climate dwell,\r\n    Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,\r\n    Yet throw such charges of vexation on’t,\r\n    As it may lose some colour.”\r\n\r\nIn the words of another of Shakspeare’s dramas, “joy cannot show itself\r\nmodest enough without a badge of bitterness.” _Inter delicias semper\r\naliquid sævi nos strangulat_, says the Latin adage; the _aliquid sævi_\r\nanswering to the _aliquid amari_ of Lucretius, _quod in ipsis floribus\r\nangat_; or again to the _aliquid solliciti_ of Ovid,\r\n\r\n          ... “Nulla est sincera voluptas;\r\n    Sollicitique aliquid lætis intervenit.”\r\n\r\nWhy, Byron asks himself, in his diary (at Ravenna), why, at the very\r\nheight of desire and human pleasure, does there mingle a certain sense\r\nof doubt and sorrow—a fear of what is to come—a doubt of what _is_—a\r\nretrospect of the past, leading to a prognostication of the future?\r\nMrs. Browning has penned a suggestive sonnet to which the title is\r\nsuperscribed of Pain in Pleasure:\r\n\r\n    “A thought lay like a flower upon my heart,\r\n    And drew around it other thoughts like bees\r\n    For multitude and thirst of sweetnesses,—\r\n    Whereat rejoicing, I desired the art\r\n    Of the Greek whistler, who to wharf and mart\r\n    Could lure those insect swarms from orange-trees,\r\n    That I might hive me with such thoughts, and please\r\n    My soul so, always. Foolish counterpart\r\n    Of a weak man’s vain wishes! While I spake,\r\n    The thought I called a flower, grew nettle-rough—\r\n    The thoughts called bees, stung me to festering,\r\n    Oh, entertain (cried reason, as she woke,)\r\n    Your best and gladdest thoughts but long enough,\r\n    And they will all prove sad enough to sting.”\r\n\r\nAs Shakspeare words it in one of _his_ sonnets,\r\n\r\n    “Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;\r\n    Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,\r\n    And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud,”\r\n\r\nand every gourd has its worm. So again Cowper:\r\n\r\n    “Here every drop of honey hides a sting;\r\n    Worms wind themselves into our sweetest flowers.”\r\n\r\nOn the same text moralizes the meditative sire of the Cid, in Corneille’s\r\ntragedy:\r\n\r\n    “Jamais nous ne goûtons de parfaite allégresse:\r\n    Nos plus heureux succès sont mêlés de tristesse;\r\n    Toujours quelques soucis en ces événements\r\n    Troublent la pureté de nos contentements.”\r\n\r\n_Semper amari aliquid._ It is like Johnson’s reflections on his first\r\ntransports at Ranelagh. When first he entered those festive gardens,\r\nit gave, he tells Boswell, an expansion and gay sensation to his mind,\r\nsuch as he never experienced anywhere else. But, as Xerxes wept when he\r\nreviewed his immense army, and considered that not one of that great\r\nmultitude would be alive a hundred years afterwards, so it went to the\r\ndoctor’s heart to consider that there was not one in all that brilliant\r\ncircle but was afraid to go home and think; that “the thoughts of each\r\nindividual there would be distressing when alone.” Boswell approves the\r\nreflection as “experimentally just,” and appends a commonplace of his\r\nown, upon the feeling of langour, which succeeds the animation of gaiety,\r\nbeing itself a very severe pain.\r\n\r\nIt was in the mid hey-day of military triumph that Paulus Æmilius\r\nastonished his encircling admirers by, first, a prolonged silence, and\r\nnext, a sombre homily on the vicissitudes of fortune, and of human\r\naffairs. What time for confidence can there be to man, he asked,\r\nwhen in the very instant of victory he must necessarily dread the\r\npower of fortune, and the very joy of success must be mingled with\r\nanxiety—_aliquid solliciti_—from a reflection on the course of unsparing\r\nfate, which humbles one man to-day, and to-morrow another! Gladdening is\r\nthe gourd, with its pleasant promise of protection against the arrow that\r\nflieth by day from a burning sun; but only him can it make, like Jonah,\r\nexceeding glad, who knows not, or makes a point of forgetting, what a\r\nworm can do, between a setting and a rising sun.\r\n\r\nThe night thoughts of man in general are one with the Night Thoughts of\r\nYoung in particular, when he exclaims,\r\n\r\n    “How sad a sight is human happiness\r\n    To those whose thoughts can pierce beyond an hour!\r\n    —Know, smiler! at thy peril thou art pleased:\r\n    Thy pleasure is the promise of thy pain.”\r\n\r\nThis is the state of man, by the experience of Shakspeare’s Wolsey:\r\nto-day he puts forth the tender leaves of hope; to-morrow blossoms, and\r\nbears his blushing honours thick upon him. He is exceeding glad, even as\r\nthe prophet of his gourd; but a worm is preparing, or if not, a frost;\r\nand next day, or at latest\r\n\r\n    “The third day, comes a frost, a killing frost;\r\n    And,—when he thinks, good easy man, full surely\r\n    His greatness is a ripening,—nips his root,\r\n    And then he falls.”\r\n\r\nThe worm may speed in its mission, or otherwise; but the fulfilment of\r\nits mission is only a question of time. There is a\r\n\r\n        ... “little rift within the lute,\r\n    That by-and-by will make the music mute,\r\n    And ever widening slowly silence all.\r\n\r\n    “The little rift within the lover’s lute\r\n    Or little pitted speck in garner’d fruit,\r\n    That, rotting onward slowly moulders all.”\r\n\r\nSlowly, sometimes, but surely. Not so slowly as surely.\r\n\r\nRemembering both the “foolish pride” of Jonah in his gourd, and his\r\n“impious discontentment” at the decree which smote it, which of us but\r\nmight, for ourselves, do worse than adopt the words and the spirit of one\r\nverse at least of Pope’s Universal Prayer,\r\n\r\n    “Save me alike from foolish pride\r\n      And impious discontent\r\n    At aught Thy wisdom hath denied,\r\n      Or aught Thy bounty lent.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_SELF-PRAISE._\r\n\r\nPROVERBS xxvii. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger,\r\nand not thine own lips.” Our English adage, “Self-praise is no\r\nrecommendation,” has its analogue in the Latin: _Laus in proprio ore\r\nsordescit_—“A man’s own laudation of himself is unseemly.” Another bit of\r\ngood old Latin admonition is, to enlarge rather upon the praises of one’s\r\nfriends, than upon one’s own: _Amicorum, magis quàm tuam ipsius laudem,\r\nprædica_; which seems to be, however, but a literal transcript of the\r\nsecond line in a couplet from the Greek Anthology:\r\n\r\n    Ὑπὲρ σεαυροῦ μὴ φράσης ἐγκώμια·\r\n    Φίλων ἔπαινον μᾶλλον ἢ σαυτοῦ λέγε.\r\n\r\nSyrus, again, utters the caution, “That whoso praiseth himself will\r\nsoon find some one to laugh at him”—_Qui seipsum laudat, cito derisorem\r\ninveniet_. It was Æsop’s derisive counsel to an unreadable author, who\r\ndid all his own praising and puffing, and therefore did it well—well, at\r\nleast, in quantity, if not in quality—to stick by all manner of means to\r\nthat home-brewed system; for it was the poor creature’s only chance of\r\never tasting the sweets of praise at all.\r\n\r\n    “Ego, quod te laudas, vehementer probo,\r\n    Namque hoc ab alio nunquam continget tibi.”\r\n\r\nIn one of the wordy encounters between Shakspeare’s Beatrice and\r\nBenedick, the lady imputes signal unwisdom to the signor, when she tells\r\nhim “There’s not one wise man in twenty that will praise himself.”\r\nBenedick scouts this as an old, old apophthegm, quite out of date; for,\r\nsays he, “if a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies,\r\nhe shall live no longer in monument than the bell rings, and the widow\r\nweeps.” And how long is _that_? Why, an hour in clamour (the bell),\r\nand (the widow) a quarter in rheum. Therefore, he infers, “it is most\r\nexpedient for the wise to be the trumpeter of his own virtues, as I am to\r\nmyself. So much for praising myself (who, I myself will bear witness, is\r\npraiseworthy).” Shakspeare often expatiates, with dramatic diversities\r\nof phase and aspect, of character and incident, upon this worldly-wise\r\ntheme, by the worldly-wise held worthy of all acceptation, of every man\r\nhis own trumpeter. To a few examples out of these many we may recur anon.\r\n\r\nSwift is writing after his own humour when he says, in the work he seems\r\nto have admired the most of his voluminous _opera omnia_, but to which\r\nsome refer as the distinct cause of his never getting a bishopric—“That\r\nas for the liberty he has thought fit to take of praising himself\r\nupon some occasions or none, he is sure it will need no excuse, if a\r\nmultitude of great examples be allowed sufficient authority; for it is\r\nto be noted,” he goes on to say, that praise was originally a pension\r\npaid by the world; but the moderns, finding the trouble and charge too\r\ngreat in collecting it, “have lately bought out the fee simple; since\r\nwhich time the right of presentation is wholly in ourselves.” But it is\r\nin the simpler states and stages of society, according to a latter-day\r\nessayist on social subjects, that the man who values himself highly has\r\nlittle scruple in confessing as much. “Savages have no more reticence\r\nin parading their good points than peacocks.” North American Indians,\r\nand the like, sublimely ignore any such courses of conduct as that, Not\r\nhe that approveth himself is commended. Their faith and practice run\r\ncounter to this kind of self-discipline. Chateaubriand gives an example\r\nof the style of chant in which a jubilant warrior, Sioux or Iroquois,\r\nproclaims his doughty prestige:—“Brave and renowned were my forefathers.\r\nMy grandsire was the wisdom of his tribe, and the thunder of war. My\r\nfather was a pine-tree in strength. My great-grandmother gave birth to\r\nfive men of war; my grandmother was alone worth a council of sachems;\r\nmy mother makes first-rate soup. As for myself, I am stronger and wiser\r\nthan all my ancestors.” Later Americans, _not_ of the redskin family, are\r\ncharged with a scarcely inferior knack of extolling themselves in all\r\nthe simplicity of an ignorance which knows nothing higher or better, and\r\nwith being frankly astonished at their own successes. Among them, it is\r\nalleged by caustic Cis-atlantic criticism, nobody is thought the worse of\r\nfor praising himself; whereas among ourselves, “the practice is out of\r\ndate; a man cannot here puff himself off with impunity—without in fact,\r\nbeing taken for a fool; and therefore, if he have ordinary sagacity,\r\nhe will keep within bounds.” But not the less, it is allowed, must the\r\nthought of the heart find some outlet; men draw wide distinctions between\r\npride and vanity, but both have at least this in common, that they like\r\nto feel and be acknowledged “first;” and both, it is added, “agree in\r\nthe instinct to gain their end by a side-wind—to boast themselves by\r\nimplication, if circumstances will not permit the more agreeable incense\r\nof positive praise and adulation.”\r\n\r\nPlutarch does not blame Cato (the elder) for perpetually boasting and\r\nexalting himself, although the old censor somewhere pronounces it absurd\r\nfor a man either to praise or to disparage himself. But Plutarch _does_\r\n“think the man who is often praising himself, not so complete in virtue\r\nas the modest man, who does not even want others to praise him.” He takes\r\nfrequent note of the habit of self-commendation in some of his heroes,\r\nand of the absence of it in others. Cato, “who was never sparing in his\r\nown praises, and thought boasting a natural attendant on great actions,”\r\nwas nothing like so grievous an offender in this respect, to Plutarch’s\r\nthinking, as Cicero, whose writings, says he, “were so interlarded with\r\nencomiums on himself that, although his style was elegant and delightful,\r\nhis discourses were disgusting and nauseous to the reader; for the\r\nblemish stuck to him like an incurable disease.” Comparing this greatest\r\nof Roman orators with the greatest of the Greek, Plutarch observes of\r\ntheir respective writings, that Demosthenes, when he touches on his own\r\npraise does it with an inoffensive delicacy, never, indeed, giving way to\r\nit at all unless he has some important matter in view; whereas Cicero,\r\nhabitually and systematically, “speaks in such high terms of himself\r\nthat it is plain he had a most intemperate vanity.” Modern critics not\r\na few, German, English, and French, have made the most—not to say made\r\nthe best—of this foible of Cicero’s. In particular, Mr. de Quincey makes\r\nmerry over it, without mercy, at the father of his country’s expense.\r\n\r\nIsaac Barrow points the moral of the text which these heterogeneous\r\nannotations are meant to illustrate, with a special warning against\r\nCicero’s infirmity. “If a man have worthy qualities and do great deeds,\r\nlet them speak for him,” urges that masterly divine; they will of\r\nthemselves extort commendation; his silence about them, his seeming to\r\nneglect them, will enhance their worth in the opinion of men. “Prating\r\nabout them, obtruding them upon men, will mar their credit, inducing men\r\nto think them done, not out of love to virtue, but for a vain-glorious\r\ndesign. Thus did Cicero, thus have many others, blasted the glory of\r\ntheir virtuous deeds.” It is quaintly said by Owen Feltham, that whoso\r\nmakes boast of the good he truly has, obscures much of his own worth,\r\nin drawing it up by so unseemly a bucket as his own tongue. “Though the\r\nvaunts be true, they do but awaken scoffs; and instead of a clapping\r\nhand, they find a look of scorn.” When a soldier bragged too much of a\r\ngreat scar in his forehead, he was asked by Augustus if he did not get\r\nit when he turned his back on the enemy. So, “If I have done anything\r\nwell”—this is one of Feltham’s “Resolves,”—“I will never think it worth\r\nwhile to tell the world of it.”\r\n\r\n    “O sir, to such as boasting show their scars,\r\n    A mock is due,”\r\n\r\nsays Shakspeare’s Troilus to Ulysses—modest, valiant Trojan, to shrewd,\r\ncircumspect Greek. So another Trojan to another Greek, in the same\r\nplay—which Coleridge reckoned almost the most wonderful of Shakspeare’s\r\nall—Æneas, namely, to Agamemnon; or rather, indeed, Æneas to himself, in\r\nAgamemnon’s hearing:—\r\n\r\n        ... “But peace, Æneas,\r\n    Peace Trojan; lay thy finger on thy lips!\r\n    The worthiness of praise disdains his worth,\r\n    If that the praised himself bring the praise forth:\r\n    But what the repining enemy commends,\r\n    That breath fame follows; that praise, sole pure, transcends.”\r\n\r\nAnd in yet another scene, Agamemnon, King of Men, pithily and pointedly\r\ntells that stalwart dullard—big, blustering, boisterous Ajax—who, for the\r\nlife of him, cannot see the pith or point of it, that “whatever praises\r\nitself but in the deed, devours the deed in the praise.” Ajax suspects\r\nnot the general to mean that _he_, son of Telamon, is his own praise, his\r\nown chronicle.\r\n\r\nOne more excerpt from our myriad-minded poet:—“Then we wound our modesty,\r\nand make foul the clearness of our deservings, when of ourselves we\r\npublish them.” The wise saw drops from the sententious lips of the sage\r\nold steward of the Countess of Roussillon in what is probably as little\r\nread and slightly relished as any of Shakspeare’s plays.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYears ago there used to perambulate the streets of London, a prodigy of\r\na hat, some seven feet high, the trade-mark advertisement of a hatter\r\nin the Strand. This gigantic puff Mr. Carlyle once made the text for\r\nsome characteristic strictures on the puffery of the age. Every man his\r\nown trumpeter: that he alleged was, to an alarming extent, the accepted\r\nrule. “Make loudest possible proclamation of your hat.” Against which\r\ndoctrine our strenuous _censor morum_ objected, that nature requires\r\nno man to make proclamation of his doings and hat-makings; but, on the\r\ncontrary, forbids all men to make such. There is not, he contends, a\r\nman, or hat-maker born into the world but feels, or has felt, that he\r\nis degrading himself if he speak of his excellences, and prowesses, and\r\nsupremacy in his craft. His inmost heart says to him, “Leave thy friends\r\nto speak of these: if possible, thy enemies to speak of these; but at all\r\nevents, thy friends.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_PAINTED FACE, TIRED HEAD, & EXPOSED SKULL._\r\n\r\n2 KINGS ix. 30, 35.\r\n\r\n\r\nJezebel’s painting her face and tiring her head, is so immediately\r\nfollowed, in the narrative of her death and non-burial, by there being\r\nfound no more of her left than the skull, besides the feet and the palms\r\nof the hands, that the connection is grimly suggestive of certain stanzas\r\nin the “Vision of Sin:”\r\n\r\n    “You are bones, and what of that?\r\n      Every face, however full,\r\n    Padded round with flesh and fat,\r\n      Is but modell’d on a skull.\r\n\r\n    “Death is king, and Vivat Rex!\r\n      Tread a measure on the stones,\r\n    Madam—if I know your sex\r\n      From the fashion of your bones.”\r\n\r\nByron muses on a skull[10] from among scattered heaps, as now a shattered\r\ncell which even the worm disdains; he ponders on its broken arch, its\r\nruined wall, its chambers desolate, and portals foul; yet,\r\n\r\n        ... “this was once Ambition’s airy hall,\r\n    The dome of Thought, the palace of the Soul:\r\n    Behold through each lack-lustre, eyeless hole,\r\n    The gay recess of Wisdom and of Wit\r\n    And Passion’s host, that never brook’d control.”\r\n\r\nIt is Yorick’s skull that Hamlet is apostrophizing when he says, “Now\r\nget you to my lady’s chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick,\r\nto _this_ favour she must come.” _Tôt ou tard_, as _le bon réligieux_\r\nin “Atala” reminds his fair young listener, _quelle qu’eût été votre\r\nfelicité, ce beau visage se fút changé en cette figure uniforme que le\r\nsépulcre donne à la famille d’Adam_. The good king Réné had painted on\r\nthe walls of one of the rooms in the Celestine monastery at Avignon, a\r\nskeleton—it was that of a once surpassing beauty who had won his heart.\r\nHow would the moral have lost its point had the head of the skeleton\r\nbeen replaced, like that in the painter’s room in the Strada Vecchia\r\nof Rome, so graphically described in “Dutch Pictures,” by a mask, or\r\ncardboard “dummy” of a superlatively inane cast of beauty—the blue eyes\r\nand symmetrical lips (curved into an unmeaning and eternal simper),\r\nthe pink cheeks, and silken doll’s tresses, “contrasting strangely\r\nwith the terribly matter-of-fact bones and ligaments beneath—the moral\r\nto my lady’s looking-glass.” Gwillim, the Pursuivant, as quoted, not\r\napprovingly, in Southey’s “Doctor,” counsels all gentlewomen that are\r\nproud of their beauty to consider that they “carry on their shoulders\r\nnothing but a skull wrapt in skin, which one day will be loathsome to be\r\nlooked on.” The old French poet Villon, _aux charniers des Innocents_,\r\nspeculates in a manner that to one critic recalls the graveyard scene in\r\n“Hamlet,” on the destiny of _corps féminin, qui tant est tendre, poli,\r\nsuave, gracieux_—for how can he help his thoughts running thitherward\r\n“quand il considère ces têtes entassées en ces charniers”? Who, indeed,\r\nas Keats once asked,\r\n\r\n    “Who hath not loiter’d in a green churchyard,\r\n      And let his spirit, like a demon mole,\r\n    Work through the clayey soil and gravel hard,\r\n      To see skull, coffin’d bones, and funeral stole;\r\n    Pitying each form that hungry Death has marr’d,\r\n      And filling it once more with human soul?”\r\n\r\nIn such a spot Blair lingers, to apostrophize beauty, as a pretty\r\nplaything, a dear deceit, which the grave discredits. The charms\r\nexpunged, the roses faded, and the lilies soiled, what has beauty more\r\nto boast of? Will the lovers of it flock round it now, to gaze and do it\r\nhomage?\r\n\r\n    “Methinks I see thee with thy head low laid,\r\n    While, surfeited upon thy damask cheek,\r\n    The high-fed worm, in lazy volumes roll’d,\r\n    Riots unscared. For this was all thy caution?\r\n    For this thy painful labours at the glass,\r\n    T’ improve those charms, and keep them in repair,\r\n    For which the spoiler thanks thee not?”\r\n\r\nSo that much less known, but much more powerful, writer, Thomas Lovell\r\nBeddoes, muses in Death’s cabinet, the Campo Santo of Ferrara, on the\r\n“unfashionable worm,” respectless of, alike, the crown-illumined brow\r\nand the cheek’s bewitchment, as he creeps to his repast—on what? “No\r\nmatter how clad or nicknamed it might strut above, what age or sex,—it\r\nis his dinner-time.” The final residuum of such repasts becomes an\r\nunrecognisable skull, about which some chance possessor of it shall, in\r\nafter days, perhaps, indulge in cynical conjectures and speculations in a\r\ntone and to a tune like this:\r\n\r\n    “Did she live yesterday, or ages back?\r\n      What colour were the eyes when bright and waking?\r\n    And were your ringlets fair, or brown, or black,\r\n      Poor little head! that long has done with aching?”\r\n\r\nMercury, in Lucian’s dialogue, shows Menippus the skulls of several\r\nworld-famous beauties; and the philosopher falls to moralizing upon that\r\nof Helen. “Was it for this,”[11] he exclaims, “that a thousand ships\r\nsailed from Greece, so many brave men died, and so many cities were\r\ndestroyed?” Menippus was so far of the Ralph Nickleby type, “not a man to\r\nbe moved by a pretty face,” with a grinning skull beneath it: men like\r\nhim profess to look and work below the surface, and so to see the skull,\r\nand not its delicate covering.\r\n\r\nWhere, asks the author of “Esmond,” are those jewels now that beamed\r\nunder Cleopatra’s forehead, or shone in the sockets of Helen? With Mr.\r\nThackeray in another place, again, we take the skull up, and think of\r\nthe glances that allured, the tears that melted, of the bright eyes that\r\nshone in those vacant sockets, and cheeks dimpling with smiles that once\r\ncovered that ghastly yellow framework. “They used to call those teeth\r\npearls once. See! there’s the cup she drank from, the gold chain she\r\nwore on her neck, the vase which held the rouge for her cheeks, her\r\nlooking-glass, and the harp she used to dance to. Instead of a feast we\r\nfind a gravestone, and in place of a mistress, a few bones.” And has not\r\nMacaulay his “Sermon in a Churchyard”? wherein one practical improvement\r\nof the subject, as conventional pulpiteers phrase it, runs thus:—\r\n\r\n    “Dost thou beneath the smile or frown\r\n      Of some vain woman bend thy knee?\r\n    Here take thy stand, and trample down\r\n      Things that were once as fair as she.\r\n    Here rave of her ten thousand graces,\r\n      Bosom, and lip, and eye, and chin,\r\n    While, as in scorn, the fleshless faces\r\n      Of Hamiltons and Waldegraves grin.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE CARCASE OF JEZEBEL ON THE FACE OF THE FIELD._\r\n\r\n2 KINGS ix. 37.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the portion of Jezreel—by a retributive local coincidence—were to lie\r\nthe mangled remains of Jezebel—what the dogs should leave of her. “And\r\nthe carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in\r\nthe portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.”\r\n_This_, Jezebel? how could _this_ be identified with the superb wife and\r\nsuperior of the king of Israel, as she was in her prime of life and pride\r\nof place? or even with the faded form of her that, newly a widow, but\r\nenergetic and manœuvring to the last, and defiant in her fall, painted\r\nher face, and tired her head, and looked out at the window as Jehu\r\nentered in at the gate? Imperious Jezebel, thrice puissant and insatiably\r\npresuming, transformed into a heap of bone dust—reduced to her lowest\r\nterms as mere organic matter—resolved into just so much manure upon the\r\nface of the field.\r\n\r\n    “Imperious Cæsar, dead, and turn’d to clay,\r\n    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:\r\n    O that the earth which kept the world in awe\r\n    Should patch a wall to expel the winter’s flaw.”\r\n\r\nSo muses and speculates Hamlet, on the theme of “to what base uses we\r\nmay return, Horatio,” when his imagination traces the noble dust of\r\nAlexander, till he find it stopping a bunghole. ’Twere to consider too\r\ncuriously to consider so, Horatio may object. Not a jot, is Hamlet’s\r\nanswer to the objection; for look you, Alexander died, was buried, was\r\nresolved into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make loam. “And why of\r\nthat loam, whereto he was converted, might they not stop a beer barrel?”\r\n_Quod erat demonstrandum._\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Denmark was in the like mood when, in other company, he\r\ntalked, to the same purpose, of how a man may fish with the worm[12] that\r\nhath eat of a king; and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.\r\n\r\nWell may Juvenal bid the meditative moralist, _expende Annibalem_,\r\nand expound the text that _Mors sola fatetur quantula sint hominum\r\ncorpuscula_. But it needs a Shakspeare to reduce these to their lowest\r\nterms, in the style of Hamlet with imperious Cæsar,—a _reductis ad\r\nabsurdum_ indeed.\r\n\r\nSydney Smith somewhere girds at the idea of doctrinaire legislators\r\nmaking irrevocable laws for men who toss their remains about with spades,\r\n“and use the relics of these legislators, to give breadth to brocoli,\r\nand to aid the vernal eruption of asparagus.” Hawthorne once designed\r\na symbolical tale of a young man being slain and buried in the flower\r\ngarden of his betrothed, and the earth levelled over him. That particular\r\nspot, which she happens to plant with some peculiar variety of flowers,\r\nproduces them of admirable splendour, beauty, and perfume; and thus the\r\nclassic fantasy is realized, of dead people transformed to flowers.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Browne—how pregnant his hints are!—touches on Mummy as having\r\nbecome merchandize: Mizraim curing wounds, and Pharaoh being sold for\r\nbalsams.\r\n\r\nThe heroic dust, as Chateaubriand calls it, of the heart of Duguesclin,\r\nstolen during the Revolution, was on the point of being pounded up\r\nby a glazier to mix his paints. So again we read of the slaughtered\r\nhosts during the retreat from Moscow: “Some industrial companies have\r\ntransported themselves into the desert with their furnaces and their\r\ncaldrons; the bones have been converted into animal black; whether it\r\ncome from the dog or from the man, the varnish is equally valuable,\r\nand is as brilliant when drawn from obscurity as from glory.” Cornelia\r\nKnight mentions a Parmese canon, who one day, while the French were\r\nin occupation of Piacenza, found the church in possession of three\r\nsurgeons, or surgeons’ mates, of that army, “busily skinning” the dead\r\nbody of a French soldier. “Horrified at the sight, he asked the meaning\r\nof this ghastly proceeding, and was told that some scientific men had\r\ndiscovered that the human skin made excellent leather,” and that it had\r\nbeen therefore ordered that all dead bodies should be skinned, for the\r\npurpose of providing boots and shoes for the soldiers. Ziska’s skin-deep\r\ndrum-destiny was at least a seeming nobler, if not essentially a more\r\nuseful one.\r\n\r\nXenophon makes his pattern-prince desirous of having his body turned to\r\nbeneficial uses after death, by being incorporated with mother earth;\r\npositively enjoining his sons not to enshrine it in gold or silver, but\r\nto bury it in the ground as soon as the life was gone out of it. Little\r\nwould trouble him the anticipated contingency of such a _peut-être_ as\r\nBurns surmises, in the case of a recently deceased acquaintance—like\r\nXenophon, a sportsman to the core:—\r\n\r\n    “There low he lies, in lasting rest;\r\n    Perhaps, upon his mould’ring breast\r\n    Some spitefu’ moorfowl bigs her nest,\r\n                    To hatch and breed.”\r\n\r\nCyrus, like the essentially practical statesman in Mrs. Gore’s tale,\r\nwould presumably have detected no irony in Hamlet’s assignment of\r\npurpose to the ashes of imperious Cæsar: “It seemed a relief to his mind\r\nthat emperors, when turned to clay, could be turned to account.” No\r\nmore objection to that, than to such a circumstance as “The Traveller”\r\ndeplores, that\r\n\r\n    ... “in those domes where Cæsar once bore sway,\r\n    Defaced by time, and tottering in decay,\r\n    There in the ruin, heedless of the dead,\r\n    The shelter-seeking peasant builds his shed.”\r\n\r\nHave we not heard Liebig indignantly complain of our importing immense\r\nquantities of bones from abroad, thereby draining the fair foreign\r\nfields of their very life-blood—scouring as we are said to do foreign\r\nbattle-plains, that the bony reliques of warriors who fought a good fight\r\nin their day, may now be of further avail to make our bread? An English\r\nsatirist of German sentimentalism pictures a contemplative young Teuton,\r\nat dinner time, pausing over his _sauer kraut_, as he calls to mind that\r\nthe churchyard wherein his ancestor was decently deposited, has been\r\nconverted into a kitchen garden; and the conviction flashes upon him that\r\nwhat was a distinguished man is now on the table in the form of cabbage.\r\n\r\nHave we not, again, heard Monseigneur Dupanloup, Bishop of Orleans,\r\nindignantly brand, as the outcome of current materialism, such a\r\n“practical suggestion” as that of a certain M. Moleschott, that, in the\r\ninterest of humanity, “the honour of the dead should be abolished,” and\r\nall cemeteries desecrated after being used a twelvemonth, that the bones\r\ncontained in them may “supply to plants the power of creating fresh men”?\r\n\r\nIt is, I think, in one of Mr. Dicey’s letters from the East that mention\r\nis made of the writer’s seeing at Sakhara a half score of camels pacing\r\ndown from the mummy pits to the bank of the river, laden with nets in\r\nwhich were human bones, some two hundredweight in each net on each side\r\nof the camel; while among the pits were to be seen people busily engaged\r\nin searching out, sifting, and sorting the bones with which the ground\r\nis almost encrusted. The cargoes were to be sent on to Alexandria, and\r\nthence shipped to manure manufacturers in England. It is a strange\r\nfate, as the tourist reflects, to preserve one’s skeleton for thousands\r\nof years in order that there may be fine Southdowns and Cheviots in a\r\ndistant land; and he stops to muse on the idea of a _gigot_ that consists\r\nin great part of the dwellers in Memphis.\r\n\r\nThat is a graphic picture the historian of the United Netherlands paints,\r\nof the artificial earthworks devised in extremity during the siege of\r\nOstend, in 1604, when there was no earth left for the defenders to\r\nuse, nearly everything solid having been scooped away in the perpetual\r\ndelving. The very sea-dykes had been robbed of their material, so that\r\nthe coming winter might find besiegers and besieged all washed together\r\ninto the German Ocean, and it was hard digging and grubbing among the\r\nscanty cellarages of the dilapidated houses. But there were plenty of\r\ngraves, Mr. Motley proceeds to relate; and now, not only were all the\r\ncemeteries within the precincts shovelled and carted in mass to the\r\ninner fortifications, but rewards being offered of ten stivers for each\r\ndead body, great heaps of disinterred soldiers were piled into the new\r\nramparts. “Thus these warriors, after laying down their lives for the\r\ncause of freedom, were made to do duty after death.”\r\n\r\nWho, exclaims Owen Feltham, would have thought when Scanderbeg was laid\r\nin his tomb, that the Turks would afterwards break into it, and wear his\r\nbones for jewels? But _telle est la vie_—or rather, in such a connection,\r\n_la mort_.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. John Eagles, avowing an inclination to join in Shakspeare’s\r\nanathema on the movers of bones, adverts incidentally to the alleged fact\r\nof Swift’s larynx having been stolen, and being now in possession of the\r\npurloiner in America,—of an itinerant phrenologist now hawking about\r\nPope’s skull,—and of Mathews’s thigh-bone circulating from house to house.\r\n\r\nCoupling such corporeal vicissitudes _post mortem_ with the text with\r\nwhich we started, of Jezebel’s scattered remains on the face of the\r\nfield, we call to mind Ben Jonson’s description (only too historically\r\ntrue) of the dispersed fragments of him that the other day had been\r\nvirtually master of Rome, and so of the wide world. Contending hands have\r\nappropriated all that is left of him: some have ravished an arm, others a\r\nthigh; this spoiler has the hands, and that the feet; “these fingers, and\r\nthese toes; that hath his liver, he his heart....\r\n\r\n    “The whole, and all of what was great Sejanus,\r\n    And, next to Cæsar, did possess the world,\r\n    Now torn and scatter’d, as he needs no grave;\r\n    Each little dust covers a little part;\r\n    So lies he nowhere, and yet often buried.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“_CONSIDER THE LILIES._”\r\n\r\nST. MATTHEW vi. 28.\r\n\r\n\r\nVulgar utilitarianism—for there is a vulgar and shallow phase of it, as\r\nwell as a scientific and a misrepresented one—can surely find little to\r\nits fancy (but then it has no fancy) the invitation, or monition, even\r\nthough uttered in the Sermon on the Mount, of “Consider the lilies.” Why\r\nconsider them, it would fain object, seeing that they toil not, neither\r\ndo they spin? But that is the very reason for considering them. They are\r\nclothed from above with surpassing beauty, without taking thought for\r\nthemselves; so clothed, not for utilitarian ends, except in the large\r\nsense that the _dulce_ too is _utile_, that a thing of beauty is a joy\r\nfor ever; and _that_ is undeniably to be of some “use” in the world.\r\n\r\nHerein lies the simple answer to the query in the laureate’s poem,—\r\n\r\n    “Oh, to what uses shall we put the wildweed flower that simply blows?\r\n    And is there any moral shut within the bosom of the rose?\r\n    But any man that walks the mead, in bud, or blade, or bloom, may find,\r\n    According as his humours lead, a meaning suited to his mind.”\r\n\r\nAnd liberal applications lie in art as nature. The Warwickshire justice\r\ntells Shakspeare, after hearing him recite his stanzas on a sweetbriar,\r\n“Thou mightest have added some moral about life and beauty: poets never\r\nhandle roses without one.” But then Justice Shallow is the critic. The\r\nauthor of the “Citation and Examination” in which the criticism is\r\nuttered, has an imaginary dialogue between Vittoria Colonna and Michel\r\nAngelo—the former of whom defines the difference betwixt poetry and all\r\nother arts, all other kinds of composition, to be this: in them, utility\r\ncomes before delight; in this, delight before utility. Buonarotti submits\r\nthat in some pleasing poems there is nothing whatsoever of the useful.\r\nBut Vittoria thinks he is mistaken: an obvious moral is indeed a heavy\r\nprotuberance, which injures the gracefulness of a poem; but there is\r\nwisdom of one kind or other, she alleges, in every sentence of a really\r\ngood composition, and it produces its effect in various ways. “The\r\nbeautiful in itself is useful by awakening our finer sensibilities, which\r\nit must be our own fault if we do not often carry with us into action.”\r\nLeigh Hunt, in his “Song of the Flowers,” makes them exult in the fact,\r\nby their mere existence demonstrated, that heaven loves colour; that\r\ngreat Nature clearly joys in red and green: “What sweet thoughts she\r\nthinks of violets, and pinks, and a thousand flashing hues, made solely\r\nto be seen:”\r\n\r\n                “Uselessness divinest\r\n                Of a use the finest\r\n    Painteth us, the teachers of the end of use;\r\n                Travellers weary eyed\r\n                Bless us far and wide;\r\n    Unto sick and prison’d thoughts we give sudden truce;\r\n                Not a poor town window\r\n                Loves its sickliest planting,\r\n    But its wall speaks loftier truth than Babylon’s whole vaunting.”\r\n\r\nSo again Mr. Procter apostrophizes Nature in his “Song of the Snowdrop,”\r\nas having surely sent it forth alone to the cold and sullen season, like\r\na thought at random thrown,—“sent it thus for some grave reason.\r\n\r\n    “If ’twere but to pierce the mind\r\n      With a single gentle thought,\r\n    Who shall deem thee hard or blind,\r\n      Who, that thou hast vainly wrought?”\r\n\r\nBishop Copleston, in his plea for a free cultivation of the poetic\r\nfaculty, contends that its being entirely neglected must prove an\r\nirreparable injury to young minds—losing as they do that intellectual\r\ncharm from which life borrows its loveliest graces: hence he takes\r\nexception to Locke’s expression, that educators should beware of making\r\n“anything a boy’s business but downright virtue.” Surely, argues his\r\ncritic, the improvement of the faculties which God has implanted in us\r\nis itself a virtue: our attention may be given in undue measure to one,\r\nand so may violate that just harmony without which nothing is virtuous,\r\nnothing lovely. The faculty itself, which the philosopher seems to\r\ncondemn, the divine claims to be one of the kindest gifts of heaven. And\r\nwhy, then, it is asked, should man be niggardly where Providence has\r\nbeen bountiful? “Why should he think scorn of that pleasant land, and\r\nundervalue those fair possessions, which were not thought beneath the\r\ncare of the Almighty?” In the garden of Eden, we are reminded, was made\r\nto grow, not only what was good for food, but every tree also that was\r\npleasant to the sight: and in that garden man was placed, to keep it, and\r\nto dress it.\r\n\r\nIt is, as Isaac Taylor remarks, by her diversities,—her gay adornments,\r\nher copious fund of forms, and her sportive freaks of shape and colour,\r\nthat Nature allures the eye of man, while she draws him on toward\r\nthe more arduous, but more noble pursuit of her hidden analogies. An\r\ninsensible process goes on, the effect of which is gradually to invest\r\ngeneral truths with a sort of majesty, as well as beauty; so that,\r\nat length, this new charm is found to prevail over the graces and\r\nattractions of the exterior diversity of things.\r\n\r\nEven philosophy, however, has been said to teach us that nature scatters\r\nthe lavish beauties of form and colour not always with a utilitarian\r\npurpose; or rather, that beauty—merely to display beauty—is often, as\r\nin birds and flowers and shells and crystals, the object of material\r\norganization. “There is no special use in the metallic lustre on the\r\nplumage of the humming-bird, and tropical blossoms blaze for the mere\r\nsake of being splendid.” Yet is it owned to be noticeable that only in\r\nthe lower ranks of the kingdom of being is nature lavish of beauty for\r\nthe mere sake of the beautiful; and that as we advance upward in the\r\nscale of created things, a certain severity and reserve seem to grow upon\r\nnature itself.\r\n\r\nShenstone—a now all but forgotten poet—in a now quite forgotten ode,\r\nasserts, as in duty bound, the uses beyond use of Nature’s fancy work:\r\n\r\n      “Search but the garden or the wood,\r\n        Let yon admired carnation own\r\n      Not all was meant for raiment, or for food,\r\n        Not all for needful use alone;\r\n      There while the seeds of future blossoms dwell,\r\n    ’Tis colour’d for the sight, perfumed to please the smell.\r\n\r\n      “Why knows the nightingale to sing?\r\n        Why flows the pine’s nectareous juice?\r\n      Why shines with paint the linnet’s wing?\r\n        For sustenance alone? for use?\r\n    For preservation?”...\r\n\r\nAn art-poet significantly and suggestively writes, in lines to which\r\nthe contributory reader, must, on his part, supply readings as it were\r\nbetween the lines:\r\n\r\n    “This wild white rose-bud in my hand hath meanings meant for me alone,\r\n    Which no one else can understand: to you it breathes with altered tone;\r\n    How shall I class its properties for you? or its wise whisperings\r\n    Interpret? Other eyes and ears it teaches many other things.”\r\n\r\nThe dull of hearing and seeing, it teaches very little. Josiah the\r\ncurate, in Colonel Hamley’s tale, finds nothing suggestive in a rose in a\r\nbuttonhole—not that he lacks interest in the flower in what he thinks its\r\nproper place. He never, he owns, could see any possible affinity between\r\nflowers and broadcloth; and why people should pluck blossoms from the\r\nstems and leaves that harmonize so well with them, to stick them into a\r\ndingy produce of the loom, he holds to be one of the puzzles of humanity.\r\nBut Josiah is indulgent to that sister Rosa of his, who confessedly\r\nresembles the lilies in so far that she toils not, neither does she spin;\r\nand who, idle child, seems to think human beings ought to be content with\r\nmerely blooming.\r\n\r\nWe like our churches to be beautiful, and our temples, and our whole\r\nsymbolic creations, Mr. Hannay somewhere observes; their beauty\r\nrepresents the general beauty of the universe, and that is one of the\r\nmodes by which God is pleased to appeal to our faculties of love and\r\nwonder and admiration. “The Romanists call the Virgin Mary a ‘mystical\r\nrose,’ and a beautiful woman is a mystical rose; attractive, and yet, at\r\nthe same time, a religious symbol—an object which keeps alive in you the\r\nsense of wonder and love of beauty, and thankfulness to the Supreme for\r\nthe glories of His creation.”\r\n\r\nIt has been said by an art-poet already quoted, that “the girl who twines\r\nin her soft hair the orange-flower, with love’s devotion, by the mere\r\nact of being fair, sets countless laws of life in motion.” Dr. Croly, in\r\nhis “Salathiel,” pleading for the _right_ of beauty to have a natural\r\npower over the heart, urges, for instance, that all that overcomes\r\nselfishness—the besetting sin of the world—is an instrument of good; and\r\ngoes on to say that beauty is but melody of a higher kind—both alike\r\nsoftening the troubled and hard nature of man. “Even if we looked on a\r\nlovely woman but as on a rose, an exquisite production of the summer\r\nhours of life, it would be idle to deny her influence in making even\r\nthose summer hours sweeter.” We may apply the suggestion in one of Mrs.\r\nBrowning’s last poems—\r\n\r\n    “What if God has set her here\r\n      Less for action than for Being?—\r\n    For the eye and for the ear.\r\n\r\n    “Just to show what beauty may,\r\n      Just to prove what music can.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A HISTRIONIC ASPECT OF LIFE._\r\n\r\n1 CORINTHIANS vii. 31.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe apostle would have his brethren so to use this world, as not abusing\r\nit; and for this reason, that “the fashion of this world passeth away.”\r\nIn the original the phrase runs: παράγει γὰρ τὸ ΣΧΗΜΑ τοῦ κόσμου τούτου.\r\nThe expression is said by Grotius and others to be borrowed from the\r\ntheatre, and to refer to the scene-shifting of the stage. Life here below\r\nhas verily its histrionic aspects; the fashion of it passeth away much as\r\ndo the scene-painter’s creations, the stage-carpenter’s framework, the\r\nspectacular effects and dissolving views, nay the very actors themselves.\r\nFor, all the world is in some sense a stage, and all the men and women\r\nmerely players—\r\n\r\n    “They have their exits and their entrances;\r\n    And one man in his time plays many parts,\r\n    His acts being seven ages.”\r\n\r\nConsidering his own profession, the figure is one that must often have\r\ncrossed and occupied Shakspeare’s mind—at once so keenly observing and\r\nso profoundly meditative. Not that he harps much upon it, so much as\r\nmight, perhaps, have been expected, in his plays. Still he does now and\r\nthen recur to the histrionic metaphor. And it is in his graver mood, not\r\nhis lighter, that he does so; in sober sadness, not with gibing glee. As\r\nwhere Lear, in the extremity of his distraction, intent on preaching to\r\nGloster, takes for his text the wail of infancy, crying, the first time\r\nthat it smells the air: for\r\n\r\n    “When we are born, we cry, that we are come\r\n    To this great stage of fools.”\r\n\r\nOr again, as where Antonio, the care-fraught merchant of Venice, assured\r\nby a friend that he is looking far from well, indeed “marvellously\r\nchanged,” and remonstrated with for not taking life more easily, replies:\r\n\r\n    “I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano,\r\n    A stage where every man must play a part,\r\n    And mine a sad one.”\r\n\r\n_Mundus universus exercet histrioniam_,—the saw is Petronius Arbiter’s.\r\nThere is an obverse reading, by some other old Eminent Hand: _Totum\r\nmundum agit histrio_. If all the world’s a play, so again there’s not in\r\nall the world a character the player won’t act. Lucretius had the stage\r\nsimile of life in his mind’s eye, when he said of those who hide certain\r\nof their doings, _vitæ post-scenia celant_,—the _post-scenium_ being what\r\nwe call “behind the scenes,” where the actors dress and “make up” for\r\ntheir parts. And what says a distich in the Greek Anthology:\r\n\r\n    “Σκηνὴ πᾶς ὁ βίος, καὶ παίγνιον· ἢ μάθε παίζειν,\r\n    Τὴν σπουδὴν μεταθεὶς, ἢ φέρε τὰς ὀδύνας.”\r\n\r\n    “Life is a stage, a play: so learn thy part,\r\n    All cares removed, or rend with grief thy heart.”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Browne professes, in his large utterance and stately style:\r\n“The world to me is but a dream or mock show, and we all therein but\r\npantaloons and anticks, to my severer contemplations.” To the same\r\neffect, though not in the same spirit, Wordsworth’s recluse avows himself\r\ntired\r\n\r\n    “Of the ostentatious world a swelling stage\r\n    With empty actions and vain passions stuffed.”\r\n\r\nWhen both Swift and Bolingbroke had closed the tenth lustre of their\r\nyears, his cynical lordship wrote from Brussels to the cynical dean,\r\nthat he thought it high time to determine how they should “play the\r\nlast act of the farce. Might not my life,” adds accomplished St. John,\r\n“be entitled much more properly a what-d’ye-call-it than a farce? Some\r\ncomedy, a great deal of tragedy, and the whole interspersed with scenes\r\nof Harlequin, Scaramouch, and Dr. Baloardo.” Accomplished St. John was\r\nalways, and to the last an accomplished actor. As for Dr. Swift, he\r\nexpanded the histrionic similitude of life into some eighteen stanzas on\r\nthe puppet show—which record how wit, “the life of man to represent, and\r\nturn it all to ridicule, did once a puppet show invent, where the chief\r\nactor is a fool”—and of which, perhaps, the gravest runs thus:\r\n\r\n    “This fleeting scene is but a stage\r\n      Where various images appear;\r\n    In different parts of youth and age,\r\n      Alike the prince and peasant share.”\r\n\r\nDon Quixote tells Sancho Panza how like human life is to a play. One\r\ntakes the part of a ruffian, another of a liar, a third of a merchant,\r\na fourth of a soldier. This man is for the occasion the lover; that man\r\nis the judicious friend. At last the play is ended. Each takes off the\r\nclothes which belong to his part, and the players remain equal. So it is\r\nin the comedy of this world, says Don Quixote. There are emperors and\r\npopes, and all the characters that can be introduced into a play; but it\r\nis played out, death takes away the outward trappings which made them\r\nseem to differ, and they remain equal in the tomb.\r\n\r\nWhere, is the author of the Complaint’s complaining query, or querulous\r\nplaint,\r\n\r\n    “Where, the prime actors of the last year’s scene;\r\n    Their port so proud, their buskin, and their plume?”\r\n\r\nIt is a trite topic, indeed, with Dr. Young,—that of “Life’s gay stage,\r\none inch above the grave,” whereon those strut and fret their hour, that\r\nshall soon be seen no more for ever. All, merely players.\r\n\r\n    “Each, in his turn, some tragic story tells,\r\n    With now and then a wretched farce between.”\r\n\r\nDr. Maginn takes note of the frequency with which Lucian compares life to\r\na theatrical procession, in which magnificent parts are assigned to some,\r\nwho pass before the eyes of the spectators clothed in costly garments,\r\nand bedecked with glittering jewels; but, the moment the show is over,\r\nare reduced to their original nothingness, no longer kings and heroes,\r\nbut poor players whose hour has been strutted out.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that the master Showman of Vanity Fair should pen an _envoi_\r\nafter this fashion:\r\n\r\n    “The play is done; the curtain drops,\r\n      Slow falling to the prompter’s bell:\r\n    A moment yet the actor stops,\r\n      And looks around, to say farewell.\r\n    It is an irksome word and task;\r\n      And when he’s laughed and said his say,\r\n    He shows, as he removes the mask,\r\n      A face that’s anything but gay.”\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole will be found iterating and reiterating in his letters\r\na favourite apophthegm of his—that the world is a comedy to those who\r\nthink, a tragedy to those who feel.\r\n\r\nOne might safely assume beforehand that a people of so histrionic a turn\r\nas the French would make good use of the histrionic metaphor of life,\r\nin their _belles lettres_, of whatever date. And in point of fact the\r\nfigure is a well-worked one in French literature. Now it is a Cardinal\r\nde Retz, who, on being named coadjutor to his uncle, the Archbishop of\r\nParis, describes himself as thereupon ceasing to be “in the pit, or\r\nat best in the orchestra, playing and funning with the fiddles,” but\r\nmounting thence to the stage itself. Indeed, a modern critic has remarked\r\nthat Retz is perpetually making use of these expressions and images of\r\n_théâtre_ and _comédie_. He was an accomplished actor from first to\r\nlast—not above the line of low comedy now and then, and quite an adept in\r\nthe Cloak-and-Sword business. Now again it is his contemporary, Madame de\r\nMotteville, who so frequently represents herself as an occupant of one of\r\nthe best boxes, intent on diverting herself with the _belle comédie_ that\r\nwas being played under her eyes. “Les cabinets des rois,” says Madame—who\r\nought to know—are theatres in which pieces of universal interest are for\r\never being played: some simply comic; others decidedly tragical, though\r\nso frequently occasioned by the merest trifles. So, again, Madame des\r\nUrsins (the Princess Orsino), another _habituée_ behind the scenes, and\r\nherself a star of the first magnitude in any working company, describes\r\nthe world as _une comédie où il y avait souvent de bien mauvais acteurs_.\r\n\r\nThen, too, we have the Abbé Chaulieu, when dancing attendance on the\r\nDuke of Vendôme, and assisting at all the fêtes and galas got up in\r\nthat prince’s honour, writing in a sort of apologetic strain to his\r\nsister-in-law, that since all the world’s a stage, one must just be\r\ncontent to don cap and bells with the rest[13]—for if all your men and\r\nwomen are merely players, motley’s your only wear.\r\n\r\nOf another _spirituel_, and very unspiritual, abbé of that period,\r\nChoisy, it has been observed, that his life resembled a comedy, rife with\r\nall that is most various and most improbable: his career of fourscore\r\nyears composed a complete masquerade; for\r\n\r\n    “this man in his time play’d many parts,”\r\n\r\nand in each of them he seems to have acted with professional aptitude,\r\nfacility, and zest.\r\n\r\nSuch another actor, with a difference, was Voltaire. As Voltaire himself\r\nsaid of the Duchess of Maine, “Elle aimera la comédie jusqu’au dernier\r\nmoment, et, quand elle sera malade, je vous conseille de lui administrer\r\nquelque belle pièce,” etc., etc.,—so of the mocking philosopher of\r\nFerney, playing his many parts, it has been said, that he had a genius\r\nfor transformations, having always more than one _rôle_ to play in the\r\ncomedy of life—which diversity of _rôles_ jumped with his humour, and\r\njust hit the mobile preferences of a man who so early in his existence\r\nturned player. The life of Voltaire is a comedy, says Sainte-Beuve: his\r\ncorrespondence with D’Alembert shows us the coulisses and background—and\r\nlets us in to damaging and disenchanting revelations behind the scenes.\r\nElsewhere he may be seen to fret and strut his hour upon the stage,\r\ncarefully made up, and all in point device costume; but here we have him\r\nin undress, and by dusty daylight, and off his guard.\r\n\r\n_Tous les comédiens ne sont pas du théâtre_, is rightly reckoned one of\r\nthe prettiest _provérbes_ of M. Théodore Leclerc. In the Proverbe which\r\nbears that pregnant title, a nephew incidentally tells his uncle, “Vous\r\nqui êtes un homme du monde, vous appelez cela l’esprit du monde; moi qui\r\nsuis un comédien, j’appelle cela de la comédie. C’est toujours la même\r\nchose, sous un nom différent.” The salon and the stage are on a level.\r\nTo be a real man of the world, is to be an actor of the first class.\r\n\r\nM. Scribe puts the proverb as a practical epigram into the mouth of old\r\nMichonnet, when trying to soothe and inspirit his pet pupil for the\r\nstage: “Calme toi et étudie; ... il y a dans le monde de plus grands\r\ncomédiens que nous!”\r\n\r\nIndeed, according to Chamfort, there is no choice in the matter; every\r\nman, however wise and unsophisticated and open-hearted, must, sooner or\r\nlater, turn actor, on this great stage of fools. For, “la fortune et le\r\ncostume qui l’entourent font de la vie une représentation au milieu de\r\nlaquelle il faut qu’à la longue l’homme le plus honnête devienne comédien\r\nmalgré lui.” We are all actors and actresses, says one of Miss Eden’s\r\ncharacters, and “none of us quite up to our parts, though we act all\r\nday long.” Not that every one plays just the part he or she would have\r\nchosen. The distribution of _rôles_ would seem often to make this a mad\r\nworld, my masters.\r\n\r\n    “Le monde, à mon avis, est comme un grand théâtre,\r\n    Où chacun en public, l’un par l’autre abusé,\r\n    Souvent à ce qu’il est, joue un rôle opposé.”\r\n\r\nThis, one might almost paraphrase in the words of John Webster’s wobegone\r\nDuchess Mariana:\r\n\r\n    “I account this world a tedious theatre,\r\n    For I do play a part in’t ’gainst my will.”\r\n\r\nBy way of introducing his elaborate narrative of Darnley’s fate, Mr.\r\nFroude tells us of Mary Stuart, that on the political stage she was “a\r\ngreat actress. The ‘woman’ had a drama of her own going on behind the\r\nscenes; the theatre caught fire; the mock heroics of the Catholic crusade\r\nburnt into ashes; and a tremendous domestic tragedy was revealed before\r\nthe astonished eyes of Europe.” And later again, describing Mary’s\r\ncaressing wiles to beguile and tranquilise her doomed husband, on the\r\neve of the catastrophe, the same historian employs the same histrionic\r\nfigure: “Mary Stuart was an admirable actress; rarely, perhaps, on the\r\nworld’s stage has there been a more skilful player.” But the part, he\r\nadds, was a difficult one; she had still some natural compunction; and\r\nthe performance was not quite perfect.\r\n\r\nMost of our business is farce, writes old Montaigne: _Mundus universus\r\nexercet histrioniam_ (which the old French essayist’s old English\r\ntranslator renders, “All the world’s a stage, and all the men and women\r\nmerely players”). We must play our part well, he adds, but withal as the\r\npart of a borrowed personage; we must not make a real essence of a mask\r\nand outward appearance, etc. So it is one of Ben Jonson’s “Discoveries,”\r\n“de vitâ humanâ,” that our whole life is like a play—wherein every man,\r\nforgetful of himself, is in travail with expression of another. In one of\r\nhis comedies, rare Ben makes a sham inn-keeper, taking his ease in his\r\nown inn, and following his own fancies there, “imagine all the world’s a\r\nplay:—\r\n\r\n    “The state, and men’s affairs, all passages\r\n    Of life, to spring new scenes; come in, go out,\r\n    And shift, and vanish.... I have got\r\n    A seat to sit at ease here, in mine inn,\r\n    To see the comedy; and laugh, and chuck\r\n    At the variety and throng of humours\r\n    And dispositions, that come justling in\r\n    And out still, as they one drove hence another.”\r\n\r\nFor every man, in the play of this world, says pious Master Feltham, is\r\nnot only an actor, but is a spectator, too: “At the beginning (that is,\r\nin his youth) it promises so much that he is loth to leave it; when it\r\ngrows towards the middle (the act of virility), then he sees the scenes\r\ngrow thick, and fill, and would gladly understand the end: but, when that\r\ndraws near, and he finds what it will be, he is then content to depart\r\nand leave his room to others.”\r\n\r\nFielding’s philosopher asks if the actor is esteemed happier to whose lot\r\nit falls to play the principal part, than he who plays the lowest? and\r\nyet the drama may run twenty nights together, and so outlast our lives;\r\nbut at the best, says he, “life is only a little longer drama; and the\r\nbusiness of the great stage is consequently a little more serious than\r\nthat which is performed at the theatre-royal.”\r\n\r\n    “If the world be, indeed, as ’twas said, but a stage,\r\n    The dress only is changed ’twixt the acts of an age.\r\n    From the dark tiring-chamber behind straight reissue\r\n    With new masks the old mummers; the very same tissue\r\n    Of passionate antics that move through the play,\r\n    With new parts to fulfil and new phrases to say.”\r\n\r\nAn old Greek writer, speaking of Alexander of Pheræ, who reigned in\r\nThessaly only ten months, and then was slain, calls him, in derision of\r\nhis brief lease of power, a theatrical tyrant, a mere stage king, who, as\r\nit were, walked on only to walk off again. But the palace of the Cæsars,\r\nPlutarch remarks, received four emperors in a less space of time, one\r\nentering, and another making his exit, as if to fret and strut each his\r\nlittle hour upon the stage. How soon the stage directions, Enter Galba,\r\nenter and exit Otho, enter and exit Vitellius, lapse in _Exeunt omnes_!\r\n\r\nIn Charles the Sixth’s ordinance, authorising the players of the\r\n“Mysteries of the Passion” (towards the close of the fourteenth\r\ncentury), that poor crazed monarch’ styles them his “loved and dear\r\nco-mates.” And what could be juster? Michelet asks. “A hapless actor\r\nhimself, a poor player in the grand historic mystery, he went to see his\r\nco-mates’—saints, angels, and devils, perform their miserable travestie\r\nof the Passion. He was not only spectator; he was spectacle as well. His\r\npeople went to see in him the Passion of royalty.”\r\n\r\nPlayers, the abstract and brief chronicles of the time, Hazlitt calls\r\nthe motley representatives of human nature. They are the only honest\r\nhypocrites, he says (and hypocrite, by the way, is classically a correct\r\nname for them, though Hazlitt may not have remembered or meant it): their\r\nlife is a voluntary dream, a studied madness—it being the height of their\r\nambition to be “beside themselves:”—to-day kings, to-morrow beggars,\r\nit is only when they are themselves that they are nothing: made up of\r\nmimic laughter and tears, they wear the livery of other men’s fortunes,\r\ntill their very thoughts are not their own. “They are, as it were,\r\ntrain-bearers in the pageant of life, and hold a glass up to humanity,\r\nfrailer than itself. We see ourselves at second-hand in them.... The\r\nstage is an epitome, a bettered likeness of the world, with the dull part\r\nleft out: and indeed, with this omission, it is nearly big enough to\r\nhold all the rest.”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Overbury had, two centuries before, written characteristically\r\nto the same purport. “All men have beene of his occupation,” writes the\r\nill-starred knight of a good actor; “and indeed, what hee doth fainedly,\r\nthat doe others essentially: this day one plays a monarch, the next\r\na private person. Here one acts a tyrant, on the morrow an exile: a\r\nparasite this man to-night, to-morrow a precisian,” and so of divers\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n    “And why not players strut in courtiers’ clothes?\r\n    For these are actors, too, as well as those.”\r\n\r\nOr, to top (Pope) Alexander the Great with Glorious John (Dryden):\r\n\r\n    “Even kings but play, and when their part is done,\r\n    Some other, worse or better, mount the throne.”\r\n\r\nAs we cannot be monarchs, says the Porpora of fiction, we are artists,\r\nand have a kingdom of our own: we dress ourselves as kings and great men,\r\nwe ascend the stage, we seat ourselves upon a fictitious throne, we play\r\na farce, we are actors. The world, he continues, sees us, but understands\r\nus not. “It is only when I am at the theatre that I see clearly our true\r\nrelations to society. The spirit of music unseals my eyes, and I see\r\nbehind the footlights a true court, real heroes, lofty inspirations;\r\nwhile the wretched dolts who flaunt in the boxes upon velvet couches are\r\nthe real actors. In truth, the world is a comedy; and we must play our\r\nparts in it with gravity and decorum, though conscious of the hollow\r\npageant which compasses us on every side.” And Godolphin pronounces life\r\nto differ from the play only in this—that it has no plot, all being\r\nvague, desultory, unconnected, till the curtain drops with the mystery\r\nunsolved.\r\n\r\nAll this is in Mr. Carlyle’s vein—of the _Sartor Resartus_ date at least;\r\nor as when he depicted the family vagaries of Mirabeaudom, which produced\r\n“such astonishing comico-tragical French farces”—with the eight chaotic\r\nvolumes of family correspondence, wherein the various personages speak\r\ntheir dialogue, unfold their farce-tragedy: “Seen or half seen, it is a\r\nstage; as the whole world is. What with personages, what with destinies,\r\nno stranger house-drama [than that of the Mirabeau family] was enacting\r\non the earth at that time.” The same figure Mr. Carlyle elsewhere applies\r\nto our own revolution times, in the century before: “Such is the drama\r\nof life, seen in Baillie of Kilwinning; a thing of multifarious tragic\r\nand epic meanings, then as now. A many-voiced tragedy and epos, yet with\r\nbroad-based comic and grotesque accompaniments, done by actors _not_\r\nin buskins;—ever replete with elements of guilt and remorse, of pity,\r\ninstruction, and fear.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nACT WELL YOUR PART:—there all the _moral_ lies. Though the world _be_\r\nhistrionical, and most men live ironically, says Sir Thomas Browne, “yet\r\nbe thou what thou singly art, and personate only thyself.”\r\n\r\nIt has been sadly and severely said of the Emperor Augustus, who was\r\nloved by no one, that if, at the moment of his death, he desired his\r\nfriends to dismiss him from this world by the common expression of\r\nscenical applause (_vos plaudite!_), in that valedictory injunction he\r\nexpressed inadvertently the true value of his own long life, which, in\r\nstrict candour, may be pronounced one continued series of histrionic\r\nefforts, and of excellent acting, adapted to selfish ends.\r\n\r\n_L’honnête homme_, writes an epigrammatic thinker, _joue son rôle le\r\nmieux qu’il peut sans songer à la galerie_.\r\n\r\nRemember, says Epictetus, so to act your part upon this stage as to be\r\napproved by the master, whether it be a short or a long one that he\r\nhas given you to perform. If he will have you to represent a beggar,\r\nendeavour to act the beggar’s part well; and so, a cripple, a prince, or\r\na plebeian. It is your part to perform well what you represent: it is his\r\nto choose what that shall be.\r\n\r\nThus spake the stoic philosopher. And how speaks the Christian divine?\r\nAs the merit of an actor, says Robert Hall, is not estimated by the\r\npart which he performs, but solely by the truth and propriety of his\r\nrepresentation, and the peasant is often applauded where the monarch is\r\nhissed; so when the great drama of life is concluded, He who allots its\r\nscenes and determines its period will take an account of His servants,\r\nand assign to each his due, in his own proper character.\r\n\r\nSince the life of man is likened to a scene, “I had rather,” writes John\r\nMilton, “that all my entrances and exits might mix with such persons\r\nonly whose worth erects them and their actions to a grave and tragic\r\ndeportment, and not to have to do with clowns and vices.”\r\n\r\nAnd this, lest such a player have to echo, in spirit, if not to the\r\nletter, the bitter conviction of blinded, blundering Leontes—_Io anche_—\r\n\r\n                              “And I\r\n    Play too; but so disgraced a part, whose issue\r\n    Will hiss me to my grave.”\r\n\r\nThe measure of a happy life, writes Lord Shaftesbury—he of the\r\n“Characteristics”—is not from the fewer or more suns we behold, the fewer\r\nor more breaths we draw, or meals we repeat; but from the having once\r\nlived well, acted our part handsomely, and made our exit cheerfully—or,\r\nto print it as he wrote it, for the lovers of old books’ sake—“and made\r\nour _Exit_ cheerfully, and as became us.”\r\n\r\nIt is well remarked by Archbishop Trench that we have forfeited the full\r\nforce of the statement, “God is no respecter of _persons_,” from the fact\r\nthat “person” does not mean for us now all that it once meant. “Person,”\r\nfrom “persona,” the mask constantly worn by the actor of antiquity, is by\r\nnatural transfer the part or _rôle_ in the play which each sustains, as\r\nπρόσωπον is in Greek. “In the great tragi-comedy of life each sustains\r\na ‘person;’ one that of a king, another that of a hind; one must play\r\nDives, another Lazarus. This ‘person’ God, for whom the question is\r\nnot _what_ ‘person’ each sustains, but _how_ he sustains it, does not\r\nregard.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_PHARAOH’S ALTERNATIONS OF AMENDMENT AND RELAPSE._\r\n\r\nEXODUS vii.-x., _passim_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis land of Egypt covered with frogs, Pharaoh was urgent with Moses and\r\nAaron to “intreat the Lord” for him, and with conciliatory proposals\r\nin favour of the children of Israel. The plague of the frogs abated\r\naccordingly, Pharaoh hardened his heart as soon as he saw that there was\r\nrespite. So with the plague of flies that came in grievous swarms into\r\nthe house of Pharaoh, and into his servants’ houses, and into all the\r\nland of Egypt, so that the land was corrupted by reason of the flies;\r\nagain Pharaoh besought Hebrew intercession, and pledged himself to acts\r\nof clemency; and again no sooner was the plague removed, than Pharaoh\r\nhardened his heart at that time also, neither would he let the people go.\r\nPlague after plague ensued—the murrain of beasts, the plague of boils\r\nand blains, and the plague of hail and fire; and so grievous was the\r\nlast—smiting all that was in the field, both man and beast, as well as\r\nevery herb and tree—that Pharaoh once more importuned Moses and Aaron,\r\nconfessing his sins, imploring forgiveness, and promising amendment.\r\nOnce and again he was heard and answered. “And when Pharaoh saw that\r\nthe rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more,\r\nand hardened his heart ... neither would he let the children of Israel\r\ngo.” The plague of locusts, destroying all that the hail had left, made\r\nhim call for the Hebrew brothers again in hottest haste,—entreating\r\nforgiveness “only this once,” and deliverance “from this death only.” But\r\nthe mighty west wind that swept away the ravagers had no sooner ceased to\r\nblow, than the hardening process again set in, and the tyrant revelled as\r\nof yore in his accustomed tyranny. How many more plagues might have been\r\nadded to the ten—decade upon decade—with the like result, each facile\r\namendment merging in a more and more facile relapse, it is superfluous to\r\nguess.\r\n\r\nWe read in Homer, as versified by Pope, that—\r\n\r\n    “The weakest atheist-wretch all heaven defies,\r\n    But shrinks and shudders when the thunder flies.”\r\n\r\nSo Boileau satirises the “intrepid” scoffer, who puts off believing in\r\nGod until fever prostrates him; who is almost as quick as the lightning\r\nto lift up his hands to heaven when the lightning glares across it, but\r\nlaughs at poor feeble humanity as soon as the atmosphere is cleared and\r\nthe storm quite spent:\r\n\r\n    “Attend pour croire en Dieu que la fiévre le presse;\r\n    Et, toujours dans l’orage au ciel levant les mains,\r\n    Dès que l’air est calmé, rit des faibles humains.”\r\n\r\nLady Mary Wortley Montagu describes in one of her vivacious letters\r\na stormy passage she has just made from Calais to Dover, and diverts\r\nherself not a little, as her ladyship’s manner is, at the distress of a\r\nfellow-passenger, in alternations of anxiety as to being lost herself\r\nand losing her smuggled head-dress. “She was an English lady that I had\r\nmet at Calais, who desired me to let her go over with me in my cabin.\r\nShe had brought a fine point-head, which she was contriving to conceal\r\nfrom the custom-house officers. When the wind grew high, and our little\r\nvessel cracked, she fell very heartily to her prayers, and thought wholly\r\nof her soul. When it seemed to abate, she returned to the worldly care\r\nof her head-dress;” and the alternative exclamations of the distracted\r\ncreature are liberally specified by Lady Mary; who then adds: “This easy\r\ntransition from her soul to her head-dress, and the alternate agonies\r\nthat both gave her, made it hard to determine which she thought of\r\ngreatest value.”\r\n\r\nLord Lytton, in one of his fictions, comments on the instinct, as he\r\ncalls it, of that capricious and fluctuating conscience, belonging to\r\nweak minds, “which remains still and drooping and lifeless as a flag on\r\na mast-head during the calm of prosperity, but flutters and flaps and\r\ntosses when the wind blows and the wave heaves.” And an example to the\r\npurpose is given in the case of a selfish uncle, whose orphan nephews\r\nare all but coldly discarded until his own son is _in extremis_. “Mr.\r\nBeaufort ... thought very acutely and remorsefully of the condition of\r\nthe Mortons, during the danger of his own son. So far indeed from his\r\nanxiety for Arthur monopolising his care, it only sharpened his charity\r\ntowards the orphans; for many a man becomes devout and good when he\r\nfancies he has an _immediate_ interest in appeasing Providence.” Such\r\na man, in such a case, becomes at any rate lavish of promises, which\r\nperhaps at the moment he even intends to keep. But how are promises of\r\nthis kind usually kept? Much after the manner predicated of Bajazet, by\r\nAcomat, in the French tragedy; a vaguely worded intimation, but definite\r\nenough in its scope: only let the pressure that extorts the promise be\r\nwithdrawn, and gone will be the value of the promise too:\r\n\r\n    “Promettez: affranchi du péril qui vous presse,\r\n    Vous verrez de quel poids sera votre promesse.”\r\n\r\nPope would consign such trifles light as air to the lunar sphere,\r\n\r\n    “Where broken vows and death-bed alms are found,\r\n    And lovers’ hearts with ends of ribbon bound,\r\n    The courtier’s promises, the sick man’s prayers.”\r\n\r\nWhy do these last make so slight an impression on by-standers? Mr.\r\nWhitehead says because it is not a living but a dying man that speaks;\r\nand a dying man who wants to live. “It is fear that cries out in agony,\r\nnot penitence that prays.” Fielding, in his masterpiece, moralises on the\r\ntruism that be men ever so much alarmed and frightened when apprehending\r\nthemselves in danger of dying, yet no sooner are they cleared from this\r\napprehension, than even the fears of it are erased from their minds. It\r\nis much later in the same story, that the “hero’s” avowed resolution, at\r\na crisis in his fortunes, to sin no more, lest a worse thing happen unto\r\nhim, is ridiculed by a cynical acquaintance, as the effect merely of low\r\nspirits, and confinement—with the quotation of “some witticisms about the\r\ndevil when he was sick.” The epigram in question is a favourite allusion\r\nwith novelists and moralists of all sorts and sizes. There is a border\r\nfreebooter of Scott’s, who, having recovered from a severe illness,\r\nthanks to the medical skill of the Black Dwarf, greets his benefactor, on\r\nhorseback, all in bandit array, as soon as convalescent. “So,” said the\r\ndwarf, “rapine and murder once more on horseback!” “On horseback?” said\r\nthe bandit; “ay, ay, Elshie, your leech-craft has set me on the bonnie\r\nbay again.” “And all those promises of amendment which you made during\r\nyour illness forgotten?” continued Elshender. “All clear away, with the\r\nwater-saps and panada,” returned the unabashed convalescent. “Ye ken,\r\nElshie, for they say ye are weel acquent wi’ the gentleman,\r\n\r\n    “‘When the devil was sick, the devil a monk would be;\r\n    When the devil was well, the devil a monk was he.’”\r\n\r\nFor it is not every vow taken in a panic, to become a monk if spared,\r\nthat is kept as Luther’s was—“devil” though the anti-Lutherans of his\r\nday might account and call him. Young Martin saw one of his friends\r\nstruck dead by his side, by a stroke of lightning, in 1505; and the\r\nsight moved him to utter on the instant a vow to St. Anne that he would\r\nbecome a monk if he were himself spared. “The danger passed over, but\r\nhe did not seek to elude an engagement wrung from him in terror. He\r\nsolicited no dispensation from his vow.” Brother Martin _ipso facto_\r\napproved himself no member of the fraternity of what Le Sage calls _vous\r\nautres, messieurs les diables_, in a passage that indirectly bears upon\r\nour theme, for it refers to the proverbial worthlessness of promises\r\ncoming from that quarter: “Voilà de belles promesses, répliqua l’Ecolier;\r\nmais vous autres, messieurs les diables, on vous accuse de n’être pas\r\nfort réligieux à tenir ce que vous promettez.” The epigram runs, if not\r\nrhymes, as well in Latin as in English:\r\n\r\n    “Ægrotat dæmon, monachus tunc esse volebat;\r\n    Dæmon convaluit, dæmon ut ante fuit.”\r\n\r\nReferring to proverbs of this kind it is that Archbishop Trench says,\r\nthat sometimes an adage, without changing its shape altogether, will yet\r\non the lips of different nations be slightly modified—the modifications,\r\nslight as they often are, being not the less eminently characteristic.\r\n“Thus in English we say, _The river past, and God forgotten_, to express\r\nwith how mournful a frequency He whose assistance was invoked, it may\r\nhave been earnestly, in the moment of peril, is remembered no more,\r\nso soon as by His help the danger has been surmounted. The Spaniards\r\nhave the proverb too; but it is with them: _The river past, the\r\nsaint forgotten_: the saints being in Spain more prominent objects of\r\ninvocation than God. And the Italian form of it sounds a still sadder\r\ndepth of ingratitude: _The peril passed, the saint mocked_.” Men\r\nindulge in doubts of a Supreme Being, says La Bruyère, when they are\r\nlusty and strong; but with sickness comes belief, such as it is. “L’on\r\ndoute de Dieu dans une pleine santé.... Quand on devient malade, et que\r\nl’hydropisie est formée ... l’on croit en Dieu.” Believes? As to that,\r\nthe devils believe, and tremble. But how when the dropsy is relieved\r\nand the trembling fit over? Dr. Johnson once adverted in conversation\r\nwith Seward and Boswell to the evil life he led until sickness wrought a\r\nreformation, which, in his case, had been lasting. Mr. Seward thereupon\r\nobserved: “One should think that sickness, and the view of death, would\r\nmake more men religious.” But Johnson replied to this: “Sir, they do\r\nnot know how to go about it; they have not the first notion. A man who\r\nhas never had religion before, no more grows religious when he is sick\r\nthan a man who has never learnt figures can count when he has need of\r\ncalculation.”[14] It is to be observed that the doctor claimed for\r\nhimself a previous regard for religion in quite early life; for some\r\nyears it had, to use his own phrase, “dropped out of his mind,” but\r\n“sickness brought it back,” and he hoped he had never lost it since.\r\n\r\nIt is an old, old story, that of the generation which tempted God in the\r\ndesert, whose days He therefore consumed in vanity, and their years in\r\ntrouble. When He slew them, then they sought Him; and they returned, and\r\ninquired early after God. But it was only to start aside again, like a\r\nbroken bow.\r\n\r\n          “Tamen ad mores natura recurrit\r\n    Damnatos, fixa et mutari nescia.”\r\n\r\n    “When men in health against physicians rail,”\r\n\r\nsays Crabbe,\r\n\r\n    “They should consider that their nerves may fail;\r\n    Nay, when the world can nothing more produce,\r\n    The priest, the insulted priest, may have his use.”\r\n\r\nThere is a passage in Montesquieu’s Persian Letters that reads like a\r\nparaphrase and expansion of this: “Quand le médecin est auprès de mon\r\nlit, le confesseur me trouve à son avantage. Je sais bien empêcher la\r\nreligion de m’affliger quand je me porte bien; mais je lui permets de\r\nme consoler quand je suis malade: lorsque je n’ai plus rien à espérer\r\nd’un côté, la religion se présente, et me gagne,” etc. Plutarch tells\r\nus of Tullus Hostilius, that he exulted in irreligious opinions while\r\nin health, but was frightened into superstition when taken ill. To\r\nthis passage, one of Plutarch’s translators, Dr. Langhorne, appends a\r\nfootnote, about none being so superstitious in distress as those who,\r\nin their prosperity, have laughed at religion; and cites as an instance\r\nthe famous Canon Vossius, who was “no less remarkable for the greatness\r\nof his fears, than he was for the littleness of his faith.” Cowper would\r\ncite to the same purpose a more distinguished example:\r\n\r\n    “The Frenchman first in literary fame;\r\n    Mention him, if you please. Voltaire? The same.\r\n    ...\r\n    The Scripture was his jest-book, whence he drew\r\n    _Bon-mots_ to gall the Christian and the Jew:\r\n    An infidel when well, but what when sick?\r\n    Oh, then a text would touch him to the quick.”\r\n\r\nSwift gives a satirical narrative of “what passed in London during the\r\ngeneral consternation of all ranks and degrees of mankind” on account of\r\nthe predicted destruction of the world by a comet, on a given day. Friday\r\nwas the declared day; and during Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, public\r\nbewilderment and terror are described as extreme—the churches crowded,\r\nand thousands praying in the public streets. At length Friday came. But\r\nas the day wore on, popular fears began to abate, then lessened every\r\nhour; “at night they were almost extinct, till the total darkness that\r\nhitherto used to terrify, now comforted every freethinker and atheist.\r\nGreat numbers went together to the taverns, bespoke suppers, and broke\r\nup whole hogsheads for joy. The subject of all wit and conversation was\r\nto ridicule the prophecy and rally each other. All the quality and\r\ngentry were perfectly ashamed, nay, some utterly disowned that they had\r\nmanifested any signs of religion.\r\n\r\n“But the next day, even the common people, as well as their betters,\r\nappeared in their usual state of indifference. They drank, they swore,\r\nthey lied, they cheated, they quarrelled, they murdered. In short, the\r\nworld went on in the old channel.”\r\n\r\nTo apply what Butler says of “saints” in his application of the word, as\r\na cant term then of political significance:\r\n\r\n    “For saints in peace degenerate,\r\n    And dwindle down to reprobate; ...\r\n    And though they’ve tricks to cast their sins,\r\n    As easy as serpents do their skins,\r\n    That in a while grow out again,\r\n    In peace they turn mere carnal men;\r\n    And from the most refined of saints\r\n    As naturally turn miscreants,[15]\r\n    As barnacles turn solan geese\r\n    I’ th’ islands of the Orcades.”\r\n\r\nThat is a fine stroke of nature, in the Knight’s Tale (from Chaucer),\r\nwhere Dryden makes Arcite resolve, only when and not until moribund, to\r\navow the wrong he has done to Palamon, and own his fear of repeating it\r\nshould he recover:\r\n\r\n    “When ’twas declared all hope of life was past,\r\n    Conscience (that of all physic works the last)\r\n    Caused him to send for Emily in haste.\r\n    With her, at his desire, came Palamon;”\r\n\r\nto whom Arcite owns the faithless part he has played, and desires\r\nforgiveness, but at the same time makes this frank avowal:—\r\n\r\n    “And much I doubt, should Heaven my life prolong,\r\n    I should return to justify my wrong;\r\n    For while my former flames remain within,\r\n    Repentance is but want of power to sin.”\r\n\r\nMr. Tennyson pictures for us a similar instance in Sir Lancelot:\r\n\r\n    “Yet the great knight in his mid-sickness made\r\n    Full many a holy vow and pure resolve.\r\n    These, as but born of sickness, could not live;\r\n    For when the blood ran lustier in him again,\r\n    Full often the sweet image of one face,\r\n    Making a treacherous quiet in his heart,\r\n    Dispersed his resolution like a cloud.”\r\n\r\nTreating of missions in Abyssinia in the sixteenth century, Gibbon\r\nrelates how, in a moment of terror, the emperor promised to reconcile\r\nhimself and his subjects to the Catholic faith. “But the vows,” adds\r\nthe historian, “which pain had extorted, were forsworn on the return\r\nof health.” Swift again, in his history of England,—for the Dean of\r\nSt. Patrick wrote one—tells how William Rufus fell dangerously sick at\r\nGloucester, on his return from Scotland, and being moved by the fears of\r\ndying, began to discover great marks of repentance, with many promises\r\nof amendment and retribution. “But as it is the disposition of men who\r\nderive their vices from their complexions, that their passions usually\r\nbeat strong and weak with their pulses, so it fared with this prince,\r\nwho, upon recovery of his health, soon forgot the vows he had made in his\r\nsickness, relapsing with greater violence into the same irregularities,”\r\netc.\r\n\r\nMichael Germain—who, however, is allowed to have looked upon\r\nthe religious observances of Rome with the eye of a French\r\nencyclopédiste—makes merry, as one of Mabillon’s Italian expedition (in\r\n1685), at the expense of that indolent and hypochondriacal Pope (so Sir\r\nJames Stephen calls him), Innocent XI. “If I should attempt,” writes this\r\nFrench Benedictine, “to give you an exact account of the health of his\r\nHoliness, I must begin with Ovid, ‘In nova fert animus mutatas dicere\r\nformas.’ At ten he is sick, at fifteen well again, at eighteen eating\r\nas much as four men, at twenty-four dropsical.... The worst of it is,\r\nthat they say he has given up all thoughts of creating new cardinals,\r\nforgetting in his restored health the scruples he felt when sick; like\r\nother great sinners;” like Louis XV., for instance, at the commencement\r\nof whose last illness Mr. Carlyle so vividly depicts the consternation\r\nof the infamous Du Barry, lest she should have to take flight, as\r\nher predecessors had been constrained to do when the Well-beloved\r\n(Bien-aimé) had been sick before. “Should the Most Christian King die, or\r\neven get seriously afraid of dying! For, alas! had not the fair, haughty\r\nChateauroux to fly, with wet cheeks and flaming heart, from that fever\r\nscene at Metz, long since; driven forth by sour shavelings? She hardly\r\nreturned, when fever and shavelings were both swept into the background.\r\nPompadour, too, when Damiens wounded Royalty ‘slightly, under the fifth\r\nrib,’ ... had to pack, and be in readiness; yet did not go, the wound not\r\nproving poisoned.” His Most Christian Majesty was of no distant kin with\r\nthat profligate viscount in Mr. Thackeray’s story, who used to recount\r\nmisdeeds “with rueful remorse when he was ill, for the fear of death set\r\nhim instantly repenting; and with shrieks of laughter when he was well,\r\nhis lordship having a very great sense of humour.” Of the same kindred\r\ncomes the same author’s Miss Crawley, as we see her ill with fright,\r\nin her lonely, loveless old age. When in health and good spirits, this\r\nvenerable inhabitant of Vanity Fair, we are assured, had as free notions\r\nabout religion and morals as Monsieur de Voltaire himself could desire;\r\nbut “when illness overtook her, it was aggravated by the most dreadful\r\nterrors of death, and an utter cowardice took possession of the prostrate\r\nold sinner.” Nor be forgotten, as a scion of the same stock, that puffy,\r\npursy, pusillanimous creature, Jos. Sedley, of whom we read that, in the\r\ncourse of his voyage home from Bengal, he disappeared in a panic during a\r\ntwo-days’ gale, and remained in his cot reading a religious tract left on\r\nboard by a missionary’s wife; while, “for common reading he had brought a\r\nstock of novels and plays,” to which of course he would return with all\r\nthe more zest and devotion when the perils of the gale were past.\r\n\r\nComparing the influence on the mind of danger of death, and of danger\r\nfrom a storm, or from some other external cause than sickness, Archbishop\r\nWhately ascribes to the storm a much larger virtue of “wholesome\r\ndiscipline” than to the deadly sickness. He says, “The well-known\r\nproverb, ‘The devil was sick,’ etc., shows how generally it has been\r\nobserved that people, when they recover, forget the resolutions formed\r\nduring sickness. One reason of the difference, and perhaps the chief,\r\nis, that it is so much easier to _recall_ exactly the sensations felt\r\nwhen in perfect health and yet in imminent danger, and to act over again,\r\nas it were, in imagination, the whole scene, than to recall fully, when\r\nin health, the state of mind during some sickness, which itself so much\r\naffects the mind along with the body.”\r\n\r\nAnd yet the effects defective of a storm are a commonplace with the\r\nsatirists. Peter Pindar devotes a “poem” to the subject; and a greater\r\npoet—if the said Peter can be called poet at all—has a forcible stanza on\r\nthe equinoxes, when the Parcæ cut short the further spinning\r\n\r\n    “Of seamen’s fates, and the loud tempests raise\r\n    The waters, and repentance for past sinning\r\n    In all who o’er the great deep take their ways:\r\n    They vow to amend their lives, and yet they don’t;\r\n    Because, if drown’d, they can’t—if spar’d, they won’t.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_SLEEP AND DEATH._\r\n\r\nST. JOHN xi. 11-14.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo His disciples our Lord spoke of His friend, and theirs, “our friend,\r\nLazarus,” as sleeping; intimating at the same time His intention of\r\ngoing on to Bethany, that He might awaken him out of sleep. “Then said\r\nHis disciples, Lord, if he sleep he shall do well. Howbeit, Jesus spake\r\nof his death; but they thought that He had spoken of taking of rest in\r\nsleep. Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.”\r\n\r\nThe affinity of sleep to death is familiarly recognised in the Old\r\nTestament as in the New; indeed, in universal literature of whatever age,\r\nsacred and profane. Bathsheba anticipates the day, only too near at hand,\r\nwhen her lord the king “shall sleep with his fathers.” Daniel foretells\r\nthe awaking of many that sleep in the dust of the earth. The psalmist\r\nutters a deprecation lest he sleep the sleep of death. Jesus declared\r\nthe sick maiden to be not dead, but sleeping; and was laughed to scorn\r\nby those who _knew_ that she was dead. Them that sleep in Jesus, saith\r\nthe apostle, will God bring with Him. We shall not all sleep, he says\r\nelsewhere, but we shall all be changed.\r\n\r\nHomer personifies a dualism of “Sleep and Death, two twins of wingèd\r\nrace, of matchless swiftness, but of silent pace;” and he makes the\r\nfriends of Sarpedon “his sacred corse bequeath to the soft arms of\r\nsilent Sleep and Death.” He pictures Aphrodite speeding to Lemnos o’er\r\nthe rolling deep, to “seek the cave of Death’s half-brother, Sleep.” The\r\ndying Gorgias, we are told, being in a slumber, and asked how he did,\r\nanswered, “Pretty well; only Sleep is commending me to the charge of his\r\nbrother.” Samuel Daniel apostrophizes “Care-charmer Sleep, son of the\r\nsable Night, brother to Death, in silent darkness born;” and so too,\r\nBeaumont and Fletcher apostrophize him in almost the selfsame words.\r\nSo again their contemporary, John Webster, “O thou soft natural Death,\r\nthat art joint twin to sweetest slumber!” Cowley’s ode _in memoriam_\r\nof William Harvey, begins with sombre commemoration of a dismal and a\r\nfearful night, “when sleep, death’s image, left his troubled breast, by\r\nsomething liker death possest.” And the last verse of Denham’s “Song to\r\nMorpheus” identifies the twins,—practically makes a hendiadys of them, as\r\ngrammarians might call it:\r\n\r\n    “Sleep, that is thy best repast,\r\n    Yet of death it bears a taste,\r\n    And both are the same thing at last.”\r\n\r\nWarton’s Latin epigram on sleep, as _certissima mortis imago_, has been\r\nEnglished by Wolcot with a beauty and felicity pronounced by critics to\r\nbe worthy of the original:\r\n\r\n    “Come, gentle sleep! attend thy votary’s prayer;\r\n    And, though death’s image to my couch repair,\r\n    How sweet, though lifeless, yet with life to lie,\r\n    And, without dying, O how sweet to die!”\r\n\r\nShelley’s opening of “Queen Mab” is a stock quotation: “How wonderful\r\nis Death, Death and his brother Sleep! one pale as yonder waning moon,\r\nwith lips of lurid blue; the other rosy as the morn when, throned on\r\nocean’s wave, it blushes o’er the world: yet both so passing wonderful!”\r\nBut where, asks a prose writer of genius, where, in the sharp lineaments\r\nof rigid and unsightly death, is the calm beauty of slumber, telling of\r\nrest for the waking hours that are past, and gentle hopes and loves for\r\nthose which are to come? “Lay death and sleep down, side by side, and\r\nsay who shall find the two akin.” But this is selecting such an aspect\r\nof mortality as comes not within the poet’s purview. Prosaical in every\r\nfibre is Sancho Panza meant to be; yet in his famous invocation of\r\nblessings on the invention, or rather on the inventor, of sleep, which,\r\nquoth he, “covers a man all over, body and mind, like a cloak”—for Sancho\r\nhas his poetical moods and tenses after all—he goes on to recognise the\r\naffinity which poetry so freely asserts: “It [sleep] has only one fault,\r\nas I have heard say, which is, that it looks like death: for between\r\nthe sleeper and the corpse there is but little to choose.” Shakspeare’s\r\nIachimo calls sleep the “ape of death.” To die, to sleep,—muses\r\nHamlet,—no more; and, by a sleep, to say we end the heart-ache, and the\r\nthousand natural ills that flesh is heir to, were a consummation devoutly\r\nto be wished. “Thy best of rest is sleep,” soliloquizes the duke in\r\n“Measure for Measure,”\r\n\r\n    “And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear’st\r\n    Thy death, which is no more.”\r\n\r\nA couplet of Butler’s, in a description of nightfall, tells how\r\n\r\n          ... “sleep the wearied world relieved,\r\n    By counterfeiting death revived.”\r\n\r\nA Greek proverb designates sleep “the minor mysteries of death”—in\r\nallusion to the lesser Eleusinian mysteries as compared with the greater:\r\n“ὕπος τὰ μικρὰ τοῦ θανάτου μυστήρια.” Sir Thomas Overbury calls sleep,\r\ndeath’s picture drawn to the life, or the twilight of life and death.\r\n“In sleep we kindly shake death by the hand; but when we are awaked, we\r\nwill not know him.” With the closing clause of this sentence compare the\r\nclosing lines in the following picture by Byron, of man o’erlaboured with\r\nhis being’s strife, shrinking to “that sweet forgetfulness of life” which\r\nsleep induces:\r\n\r\n    “There lie love’s feverish hope and cunning’s guile,\r\n    Hate’s working brain, and lull’d ambition’s wile;\r\n    O’er each vain eye oblivion’s pinions wave,\r\n    And quench’d existence crouches in a grave.\r\n    What better name may slumber’s bed become?\r\n    Night’s sepulchre, the universal home,\r\n    Where weakness, strength, vice, virtue, sunk supine,\r\n    Alike in naked helplessness recline;\r\n    Glad for awhile to heave unconscious breath,\r\n    Yet wake to wrestle with the dread of death,\r\n    And shun, though day but dawn on ills increast,\r\n    That sleep, the loveliest, since it dreams the least.”\r\n\r\nWe term sleep a death, writes Sir Thomas Browne, and yet it is waking\r\nthat kills us, and destroys those spirits that are the house of life. “It\r\nis that death by which we may be literally said to die daily; a death\r\nwhich Adam died before his mortality; a death whereby we live a middle\r\nand moderating point between life and death.” And then the golden-tongued\r\nphysician—in his _Religio Medici_—goes on to say that, in fine, so like\r\ndeath seemed to him sleep, that he dare not trust it without his prayers,\r\nand a half adieu to the world; and taking his farewell “in a colloquy\r\nwith God,” that is set in the key of the Evening Hymn, where we pray\r\nto be taught to dread the grave as little as our bed. So, in verses of\r\nhis own weaving, this consummate master of stately rhetorical prose,\r\nbeseeches God to make his sleep a holy trance:\r\n\r\n    “Sleep is a death;—O make me try\r\n    By sleeping, what it is to die!\r\n    And as gently lay my head\r\n    On my grave, as now my bed.\r\n    Howe’er I rest, great God, let me\r\n    Awake again at last with Thee.\r\n    And thus assured, behold I lie\r\n    Securely, or to wake or die.\r\n    These are my drowsy days; in vain\r\n    I do now wake to sleep again:\r\n    O come that hour when I shall never\r\n    Sleep again, but wake for ever!\r\n\r\n“This is the dormitive I take to bedward; I need no other laudanum than\r\nthis to make me sleep; after which I close my eyes in security, content\r\nto take leave of the sun, and sleep unto the resurrection.”\r\n\r\nGeorge Herbert says, that—\r\n\r\n    “When boys go first to bed,\r\n    They step into their voluntary graves;\r\n    Sleep binds them fast; only their breath\r\n    Makes them not dead.\r\n    Successive nights, like rolling waves,\r\n    Convey them quickly, who are bound for death.”\r\n\r\nYe children, does death ever alarm you? asks the venerable pastor in\r\nTegner’s _Children of the Lord’s Supper_: “Death is the brother of Love,\r\ntwin-brother is he, and is only more austere to behold.” Shakspeare’s\r\nnobleman is gazing with disgust on a sottish sleeper, when he exclaims,\r\n“Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!” That image, as\r\nembodied in the form of a little child, has often inspired poets to\r\nstrains of tender admiration. Malaspina, in one of Landor’s unacted (not\r\nto say, with almost equal truth, unread) plays thus contemplates, and\r\napostrophizes, such an image:—\r\n\r\n    “And still thou sleepest, my sweet babe! Is death\r\n    Like sleep? Ah, who then, who would fear to die?\r\n    How beautiful is all serenity!\r\n    Sleep, a child’s sleep, oh how far more serene,\r\n    And oh, how far more beautiful than any!\r\n    Whether we breathe so gently, or breathe not,\r\n    Slight is the difference.”\r\n\r\nMore familiar to every one in the least conversant with current\r\nliterature—not ephemeral in its currency, or running so fast as to\r\nbe, like that which decayeth and waxeth old, ready to vanish away—is\r\nMrs. Browning’s poem on a sleeping child—tired out with playing, and\r\nslumbering on the floor; the latter portion alone of which may here find\r\nroom:—\r\n\r\n    “And God knows, who sees us twain, child at childish leisure,\r\n    I am near as tired of pain, as you seem of pleasure;—\r\n    Very soon, too, by His grace gently wrapt around me,\r\n    Shall I show as calm a face, shall I sleep as soundly!\r\n    Differing in this, that you clasp your playthings sleeping,\r\n    While my hand shall drop the few given to my keeping.\r\n    Differing in this, that I sleeping shall be colder,\r\n    And in waking presently, brighter to beholder.\r\n    Differing in this beside (sleeper, have you heard me?\r\n    Do you move, and open wide eyes of wonder toward me?)—\r\n    That while you I thus recall from your sleep,—I solely,—\r\n    Me from mine an angel shall, with reveille holy!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_ELIAB AND DAVID IN THE VALLEY OF ELAH._\r\n\r\n1 SAMUEL xvii. 28.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Spirit of God came upon Saul, so that he prophesied among the\r\ncompany of prophets that met him, all that knew him beforetime asked one\r\nanother what was this that was come to the son of Kish? was Saul also\r\namong the prophets? Insomuch that it became a proverb, “Is Saul also\r\namong the prophets?” No prophet is accepted in his own country; _that_ is\r\nbecome a proverb too. And as with Saul, a young man among the prophets,\r\nso with youthful David among the men of war from their youth. Eliab, his\r\neldest brother, knew, as he thought, the pride and the naughtiness of his\r\nheart in coming down to the camp to see the battle; but he knew not what\r\nsterling stuff there was in the stripling. _Why_ had Jesse’s youngest\r\nson come down hither? and with whom had he left those few sheep in the\r\nwilderness? Eliab’s anger was kindled against David for his presumptuous\r\nand idle curiosity. His scorn was well-nigh as supreme as that of Goliath\r\nhimself for the youth,—for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair\r\ncountenance. Quit his proper rusticities and retirement for the valley\r\nof Elah, that bristled with spear-heads and resounded with the din of\r\nbattle! a boy like him, that should be feeding his father’s sheep at\r\nBethlehem! Was there not a cause? None that Eliab knew of, for one. He\r\nhad never seen anything in the lad to warrant this forwardness. Not to\r\nEliab or his brethren was it given to foresee in that fresh-coloured\r\nshepherd boy the present slayer of Goliath of Gath, and the bosom friend\r\nof princely Jonathan, and the paulo-post-future king of Israel, Israel’s\r\nsweetest singer, and the man after God’s own heart.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe adage about unrecognised worth, on the part of kinsfolk and\r\nneighbours, the proverb of the prophet without honour in his own country\r\nand in his father’s house—has its parallel passage in the _Hercules\r\nFurens_ of Euripides—\r\n\r\n          ... “οὑ γὰρ ἐσθ’ ὅπου\r\n    Εσθλόν τι δράσας μάρτυρ’ ἂν λάβοις πάτραν.”\r\n\r\nPlutarch adopts it in his treatise on Exile, where he says that you\r\nvery rarely find a wise man taken for such in his own country: “τῶν\r\nφρονιμωτάτων καὶ σοφωτάτων ὀλίγους ἂν εὕροις ἐν ταῖς ἑαυτῶν πατρίσι\r\nκεκηδευμένους.”\r\n\r\nThe tradition that Pythagoras borrowed all his learning and philosophy\r\nfrom the East is rejected by modern scholars: could not so great a\r\nman, they ask, dispense with foreign teachers? And the answer is, that\r\nassuredly he could and did; but his countrymen, it is to be observed,\r\nby a very natural process of thought, looked upon his greatness as the\r\nresult of his Eastern education. “No man is a prophet in his own country,\r\nand the imaginative Greeks were peculiarly prone to invest the distant\r\nand the foreign with striking attributes;” unable to believe in wisdom\r\nspringing up from among themselves, they turned to the East as to a vast\r\nand unknown region, whence all novelty, even of thought, must come. “Πᾶσι\r\nτοῖς φιλοσόφοις,” says a Greek philosopher, “ἔδοξε χαλεπὸς ἐν τῇ πατρίδι\r\nὁ βίος.”\r\n\r\nAs the first, so the most arduous conquests of Mohammed were, says\r\nGibbon, those of his wife, his servant, his pupil, and his friend; since\r\nhe presented himself as a prophet to those who were most conversant with\r\nhis infirmities as a man. “Thus was Mohammed,” writes Dean Milman, after\r\nrecording the conversion of the child Ali, “the prophet of his household.\r\nSlowly however did he win proselytes, even among his own kindred. Three\r\nyears elapsed before the faith received the accession of Abubeker and\r\nof Othman, the future caliphs. Mohammed at length is accepted as the\r\nprophet of his family, of the noble and priestly house of Hashem. Abu\r\nTalib, his uncle, remains almost alone an unbeliever. And now Mohammed\r\naspires to be the prophet of his _tribe_.” But in effect the “false”\r\nprophet is an exception to the rule of no prophet accepted in his own\r\nhouse and country. An American commentator on Shakspeare incidentally\r\nexpounds that rule, in remarking on the degree to which our sense of\r\ntruth is impeded or impaired by the pressure on our minds of what is\r\nactual and visible and present. A faithful painter may, he observes,\r\nportray a human face with all its characteristic expression, and in all\r\nits true individuality; and yet the nearest relatives are not only the\r\nhardest to satisfy, but, by the very nature of their familiarity with the\r\nsubject, will often be the worst judges of the likeness. We are all of\r\nus, he adds, “very apt to fail in appreciating the best and noblest parts\r\nin the characters of those whom we know familiarly, for the thousand\r\nfamiliarities of common life interpose; and it is sad to think that often\r\nit is not until death has hallowed and idealized the character, that we\r\ncan do it justice.” Envy and jealousy, remarks David Hume in treating of\r\nthe recognition of real genius, have too much place in a narrow circle,\r\nand even familiar acquaintance with the person of one thus gifted may\r\ndiminish the applause due to his performance—that is, among those of\r\nhis own age and country. Pindar and Æschylus, we are told, left their\r\ncountry because those who were born their equals could not endure to\r\nsee them rise their superiors. “What a war against the gods is this!”\r\na heathen admirer is made to exclaim: “it seems as if it were decreed\r\nby a public edict that no one shall receive from them any gift beyond a\r\ncertain value; and that if they do receive it they shall be permitted to\r\nreturn the gods no thanks for it in their native city.” There are towns\r\nso barbarous, remarks Boccaccio, in Landor’s “Pentameron,” that they must\r\nbe informed by strangers of their own great man when they happen to have\r\nproduced one; and would then detract from his merits, that they might\r\nnot exhibit their awkwardness in doing him honour, or their shame in\r\nwithholding it.\r\n\r\nCharles IX., on a progress through Provence, sent for Nostradamus, and\r\nfinding in what slight respect he was held by his countrymen, made a\r\npoint of publicly declaring, with right royal emphasis, that he should\r\ntake as a slight to himself the slighting of that philosopher.\r\n\r\nIn the Journal to Stella, Swift hails with cordiality—for the Dean could\r\nbe cordial on occasion—the appreciation in polite English circles, by\r\nministers and scholars, of Parnell the poet: “Lord Bolingbroke likes\r\nParnell mightily; and it is pleasant to see that one who hardly passed\r\nfor anything in Ireland makes his way here with a little friendly\r\nforwarding.” In no unlike spirit and style writes Horace Walpole to\r\nMarshal Conway, then travelling abroad: “The honours you have received,\r\nthough I have so little taste for such things myself, gave me great\r\nsatisfaction; and I do not know whether there is not more pleasure in\r\n_not_ being a prophet in one’s own country, when one is almost received\r\nlike Mohammed in every other. To be an idol at home is no assured\r\ntouchstone of merit. Stocks and stones have been adored in fifty regions,\r\nbut do not bear transplanting. The Apollo Belvedere and the Hercules\r\nFarnese may lose their temples, but never lose their estimation, by\r\ntravelling.” In another letter we have Walpole exclaiming, “But adieu,\r\nretrospect! it is as idle as prophecy, the characteristic of which is\r\nnever to be believed where alone it could be useful, _i.e._, in its\r\nown country.” And once more, in a later epistle, commenting on the\r\ndarksome aspect of the times: “That the scene grows very serious there\r\nis no doubt; nor do I assume vanity from having possessed the spirit of\r\nprophecy—a most useless talent, as predictions never serve as warnings.\r\nWe know prophets are not honoured in their own country: where then should\r\nthey be honoured? where they are not known? where probably they never\r\nare heard of?” But such notes of interrogation might be multiplied _ad\r\nlibitum_.\r\n\r\nIt is to a professedly common-place philosopher we owe the remark,\r\nthat while there are families in which there exists a preposterous\r\nover-estimate of the talents and acquirements of their several members,\r\nthere are other families in which there exists a depressing and\r\nunreasonable under-estimate of the same. He speaks to his knowledge\r\nof such a thing as a family in which certain boys during their early\r\neducation had it ceaselessly drilled into them that they were the idlest,\r\nstupidest, and most ignorant boys in the world; which boys had no sooner\r\ngone to a great public school than like rockets they went up forthwith\r\nto the top of their classes, and never lost their places there, and\r\nafterwards at the university distinguished themselves pre-eminently in\r\nhonours: “It will not surprise people who know much of human nature, to\r\nbe told that through this brilliant career of school and college work the\r\nhome belief in their idleness and ignorance continued unchanged, and that\r\nhardly at its end was the toil-worn senior wrangler regarded as other\r\nthan an idle and useless blockhead.” The writer adds an example of his\r\nknowledge of a successful author—to be identified of course by _some_\r\nreaders, whose relatives never believed, till the reviews assured them of\r\nit, that his writings were anything but “contemptible and discreditable\r\ntrash.”\r\n\r\nThe subject is renewed in the ensuing section, on the text of a prophet’s\r\nnon-acceptance in his own country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE PROPHET IN HIS OWN COUNTRY._\r\n\r\nST. LUKE iv. 24.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was with the emphasis of a “Verily I say unto you,” that our Lord\r\nprefaced the assurance that no prophet is accepted in his own country.\r\nThe speaker spoke from bitter experience. For neither did His brethren\r\nbelieve in Him. It was when He was come into His own country, and taught\r\nin their synagogues with a wisdom that astonished them, and wrought\r\nmighty works of a kind that bewildered them, that His own countrymen set\r\nabout asking if this was not the carpenter’s son? was not His mother the\r\nwell-known Mary? were not James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas, His\r\nbrethren? and His sisters, were they not all near at hand, and known\r\nas such? Whence then had this—οὗτος (indefinitely contemptuous)—all\r\nthese attributes? And they were offended, scandalized, they found a\r\nstumbling-block in the condition of Him and His. A double answer was\r\nvouchsafed them: the significant restriction of wonder working, for He\r\ndid not many mighty works there, because of their unbelief; and the more\r\ndirect reply, in so many words, that a prophet is not without honour,\r\nsave in his own country, and in his own house.\r\n\r\nMontaigne adverts to this man, or that, having been a miracle to the\r\nworld, in whom neither his wife nor his servant has ever seen anything\r\nremarkable: “Few men have been admired by their own domestics”—a sentence\r\nto which point and popularity have been given by the epigrammatic\r\nform of it, due to Marshal Catinat. “No one,” Montaigne continues,\r\n“has been a prophet, not merely in his own house, but in his own\r\ncountry, as the experience of history shows. It is the same in matters\r\nof no consequence.... In my country of Gascony they look upon it as\r\nvery droll to see me in print. The farther off I am read from my own\r\nhome, the better I am esteemed; I am fain to purchase printers in\r\nGuienne,—elsewhere they purchase me.” Ben Jonson takes note of the\r\ngreater reverence paid to things remote or strange to us, than to much\r\nbetter, if these be nearer, and fall under our sense. “Men, and almost\r\nall sorts of creatures, have their reputation by distance. Rivers, the\r\nfarther they run, and more from their spring, the broader they are, and\r\ngreater. And where our original is known, we are the less confident;\r\namong strangers we trust fortune.” Lord Evandale, in Scott’s “Old\r\nMortality,” discerns at once the “extraordinary qualities” of Henry\r\nMorton, which had escaped the notice of his kinsfolk and friends: “You\r\nhave not been long in learning all his extraordinary qualities, my lord,”\r\nsays old Major Bellenden. “I, who have known him from boyhood, could,\r\nbefore this affair, have said much of his good principles and good\r\nnature; but as to his high talents”—further on _that_ head deponent saith\r\nnot. The opinions of relatives as to a man’s power, Dr. Wendell Holmes\r\ndeclares to be very commonly of little value; not so much because they\r\nsometimes over-rate their own flesh and blood, as some may suppose; as\r\nbecause, on the contrary, they are quite as likely to underrate those\r\nwhom they have grown into the habit of considering like themselves. _Vile\r\nhabetur quod domi est_, Seneca tersely says.\r\n\r\nEdmund Burke, in early life, was not happy at home—there being none\r\namong the household on Arran Quay to sympathise with his dreams and\r\nhis aspirations. “He might think himself a genius,” says one of his\r\nmany biographers, “but it was not to be expected that his own relations\r\nshould yet think him one.” Describing his position and influence in Lord\r\nRockingham’s administration, Mr. Macknight observes that it is, after\r\nall, a man’s own relations who generally look with the least confidence\r\non his long wrestle with adversity, and are most astonished when the tide\r\nturns, and a great victory succeeds to what had seemed to them a mere\r\nhopeless toil. “To some of the Irish Nagles on the Blackwater, the news\r\nthat Edmund had been taken into the confidence of the great Whig Lord\r\nRockingham, ... must have seemed as extraordinary as it did to Joseph’s\r\nbrethren that he should have become so great a man in hostile Egypt.”\r\n\r\n_Son pays le crut fou_, says La Fontaine, of a Greek sage; _mais quoi!\r\naucun n’est prophète chez soi_. Of Joan of Arc, and her early mental\r\nstruggles, a French historian writes: “It behoves her to find in the\r\nbosom of her family someone who would believe in her: this was the most\r\ndifficult part of all.” Non-recognition, disparagement, cold obstruction.\r\nSocieties and families, as Goethe says, behave in the same way to their\r\ndearest members, towns to their worthiest citizens. Consuelo advising\r\nAnzoleto to quit Venice, reminds him that “no person is a prophet in his\r\nown country. This is a bad place for one who has been seen running about\r\nin rags, and where any one may come to say of you, ‘I was his protector,\r\nI saw his hidden talent, it was I who recommended him and procured his\r\nadvance.’” Descartes had to support with philosophic patience the scorn\r\nof his family, impatient of a philosopher in it. Jean Bodin, neglected\r\nand slighted in his own land, exulted in the welcome accorded to his\r\nbooks in the English Universities, which printed as well as prized them:\r\n“il n’est pas rare que nous ayons besoin d’apprendre des étrangers ce que\r\nvalent nos compatriotes,” observes M. Léon Feugère.\r\n\r\nEvery rule has its exceptions, and most proverbs too. The case of\r\nSt. Catharine, of Sienna, is cited by a Protestant biographer as “an\r\nexception to the rule that excludes a prophet from honour in his own\r\ncountry.” The biographer of Edward Irving, recounting with enthusiasm the\r\ndetails of his reception in Annandale in 1828, adds that “for once the\r\nproverb seems to have failed. He had honour in his own country, where\r\ngentle and simple flocked to hear him,”—neighbouring ministers shutting\r\nup their kirks on the Sunday when he preached, and going the “long\r\nSabbath-day’s journey” across the Annandale moors to hear him, along with\r\ntheir people. La Bruyère points out on the one side a man recognised by\r\nthe world at large as a master-mind, honoured and sought after by eager\r\nadmirers, but at home, of no account at all; _petit dans son domestique\r\net aux yeux de ses proches_: on the other hand, a man who is a prophet\r\nin his own house and country, who enjoys a _vogue_ that is confined to\r\nhis immediate surroundings, and who _s’applaudit d’un mérite rare et\r\nsingulier qui lui est accordé par la famille dont il est l’idole_. But\r\nexceptions to a rule are commonly taken in confirmation of it; and the\r\nrule as to a prophet’s home acceptance is held to be only confirmed, not\r\ndisproved, by here and there a stray example in history to the contrary;\r\nsuch as Arnold, of Brescia, being rescued from captivity by some of\r\nthose partisan nobles of Campania by whom he was honoured as a prophet:\r\n“Tanquam _prophetam in terrâ suâ_ cum omni honore habebant.” Or, as\r\nthe experience, highly exceptional, of young Bernard of Clairvaux, the\r\n“strange and irresistible force” of whose character, as the historian\r\nof Latin Christianity describes it, enthralled his brothers one after\r\nanother, and at length his sister. Off to the monastery of Clairvaux they\r\ntrooped, a complete monastic brotherhood. The youngest boy lingered a\r\nshort time with his aged father, and then joined the rest. “Even the\r\nfather died a monk of Clairvaux in the arms of Bernard.” But it was not,\r\nwe are duly reminded, on his own kindred alone that Bernard wrought with\r\nthis commanding power. “When he was to preach, wives hurried away their\r\nhusbands, mothers withdrew their sons, friends their friends, from the\r\nresistless magic of his eloquence.” And those that went—what went they\r\nout into the wilderness to hear? A prophet? Yea, and almost more than a\r\nprophet, by the verdict of his own country and of his father’s house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_DESIRED BOON: REALIZED BANE._\r\n\r\nPSALM cvi. 15; lxxviii. 22 sq.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe read of those who tempted God in the desert, that He gave them their\r\nrequest, and sent leanness withal into their soul. So they did eat meat\r\nand were well filled, for He gave them their own desire; but while their\r\nmeat was yet in their mouths, His wrath came upon them and slew the\r\nfattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.\r\n\r\nA latter-day poetess, almost masculine in genius, as in out-spoken vigour\r\nof diction, tells us that—\r\n\r\n    “God answers sharp and sudden on some prayers,\r\n    And thrusts the thing we have prayed for in our face,—\r\n    A gauntlet with a gift in’t,”\r\n\r\nand sometimes poison in the gift. Well therefore may the authoress of\r\nthese lines, which in their original import are scarcely applicable to\r\nour theme, make a distressed soul utter a petition that certainly is so:—\r\n\r\n            ... “’tis written in the Book,\r\n    He heareth the young ravens when they cry;\r\n    And yet they cry for carrion. O my God,—\r\n    And we, who make excuses for the rest,\r\n    We do it in our measure. Then I knelt,\r\n    And dropped my head upon the pavement too,\r\n    And prayed, since I was foolish in desire\r\n    Like other creatures, craving offal-food,\r\n    That He would stop His ears to what I said,\r\n    And listen only to the run and beat\r\n    Of this poor, passionate, helpless blood....”\r\n\r\n_Ne mihi contingant quæ volo, sed quæ sunt utilia_: the aspiration has\r\nbeen accepted as an adage, worthy of all acceptation, and of acceptation\r\nby all.\r\n\r\n    “Mais, sans cesse ignorants de nos propres besoins,\r\n    Nous demandons au ciel ce qu’il nous faut le moins.”\r\n\r\nTo Shakspeare for an illustration. Pompey, not the Great, is anxious for\r\nDivine sanction to speed his ambitious resolves to a prosperous issue.\r\nIf the great gods be just, he assumes, they will assist the deeds of\r\njustest men,—and therefore himself, as pre-eminently entitled to that\r\ndesignation. He is impatient, too, for this manifest favour from above;\r\nand sage Menecrates takes occasion not only to check his impatience in\r\nparticular, but to give him a salutary warning on the subject in general:\r\n\r\n              ... “We, ignorant of ourselves,\r\n    Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers\r\n    Deny us for our good; so find we profit\r\n    By losing of our prayers.”\r\n\r\nXenophon tells us of Socrates, that when he prayed, his petition was only\r\nthis—that the gods would give to him those things that were good; which\r\nhe did, forasmuch as they alone knew what was good for man. “But he who\r\nshould ask for gold or silver, or increase of dominion, acted not, in\r\nhis opinion, more wisely than one who should pray for the opportunity to\r\nfight, or game, or anything of the like nature; the consequence of which,\r\nbeing altogether doubtful, might turn, for aught he knew, not a little to\r\nhis disadvantage.” For,\r\n\r\n              ... “why, alas! do mortal men in vain\r\n    Of fortune, fate, or Providence complain?\r\n    God gives us what He knows our wants require,\r\n    And better things than those that we desire:\r\n    Some pray for riches; riches they obtain;\r\n    But, watched by robbers, for their wealth are slain;\r\n    Some pray from prison to be freed; and come,\r\n    When guilty of their vows, to fall at home;\r\n    Murdered by those they trusted with their life,\r\n    A favoured servant, or a bosom wife.\r\n    Such dear-bought blessings happen every day,\r\n    Because we know not for what things we pray.”\r\n\r\nThere is a Greek prayer by an unknown poet, but highly commended by the\r\nmost illustrious of Socrates’ disciples: that sovran Jove would grant his\r\nsubjects good, whether they pray for it or not; and avert from them evil,\r\neven though they pray for it.\r\n\r\n    Ζεῦ βασιλεῦ, τὰ μὲν ἐσθλὰ καὶ εὐχομένοις καὶ ἀνεύκτοις\r\n    Ἄμμι δίδου· τὰ δὲ δεινὰ καὶ εὐχομένὀις, ἀπαλέξοις.\r\n\r\nAnd it is to Plato’s dialogue upon prayer that we owe the instructions\r\nimparted by Socrates to Alcibiades, upon which Addison has founded a\r\npaper in the _Spectator_. In that dialogue we read how Socrates met\r\nAlcibiades going to his devotions, and observing his eyes to be fixed\r\nupon the ground with great seriousness and attention—for even that\r\nfastest of fast young men could, it seems, be slow enough to say his\r\nprayers—told him that he had reason to be thoughtful upon that occasion,\r\nsince it was possible for a man to bring down evil upon himself by his\r\nown supplications, and that those things which the gods sent him in\r\nanswer to his petitions might turn to his destruction. This, says he,\r\nmay not only happen when a man prays for what is mischievous in its\r\nown nature, as Œdipus implored the gods to sow dissension between his\r\nsons; but when he prays for what he believes would be for his good, and\r\nagainst what he believes would be to his detriment. This the philosopher\r\nshows must necessarily happen among us, since most men are blinded with\r\nignorance, prejudice, or passion, which hinder them from seeing what\r\nthings are really eligible for them. And all this, as his manner is, the\r\nphilosopher teaches by examples.\r\n\r\nIt seems allowed that Juvenal took the cue of his tenth Satire, as well\r\nas Persius of his second, from the Dialogue of Plato aforesaid.\r\n\r\n    “Evertêre domos totas, optantibus ipsis,\r\n    Dii faciles. Nocitura togâ, nocitura petuntur\r\n    Militiâ.”\r\n\r\nOr, as Englished by Mr. Owen of Warrington:\r\n\r\n    “Th’ indulgent gods whole houses have o’erthrown\r\n    At men’s own prayer;—the fatal choice their own.\r\n    In war we ask but woes; in peace but woes,” etc.\r\n\r\nThe Crassi, Pompeii, and the like, are represented as ruined by the\r\nassent of Heaven to their ambitious prayers—\r\n\r\n    “Magnaque numinibus vota exaudita _malignis_.”\r\n\r\nNaples to Pompey a kind fever gave, to hide his honours in a welcome\r\ngrave (the poetry of Parson Owen may pardonably be printed as prose). But\r\npublic prayers arise: the gods allow the health requested by the erring\r\nvow: by Rome’s and his cross fate that grave he fled, and lived—to lose\r\nhis honours and his head.\r\n\r\n          ... “Sed multæ urbes, et publica vota\r\n    Vicerunt. Igitur fortuna ipsius, et urbis,\r\n    Servatum victo caput abstulit.”\r\n\r\nJuvenal crowds his satire with cases in point, historical and\r\nmythological, political and domestic. The sum of the discourse is this:\r\nthat man should allow the higher powers themselves to determine what may\r\nbe of advantage to him, and suitable to his real wants,—he being dearer\r\nto them than to himself:\r\n\r\n    “Permittes ipsis expendere Numinibus quid\r\n    Conveniat nobis, rebusque sit utile nostris:\r\n    Nam pro jocundis aptissima quæque dabunt Dii.\r\n    Carior est illis homo quàm sibi.”\r\n\r\nMontaigne bethinks him that a foremost proof of our imbecility is, that\r\nwe cannot, by our own wish and desire, find out what we want. “What plan,\r\nhow happily soe’er begun, That, when achieved, we do not wish undone?”\r\nAnd he repeats the old-world story of King Midas, who prayed to the gods\r\nthat all he touched might be turned into gold; and so it was: his bread\r\nbecame gold, his wine gold, the feathers of his bed, his under-clothing\r\nand his over-coats, gold all: “so that he found himself overwhelmed with\r\nthe fruition of his desire, and endowed with a boon so intolerable, that\r\nhe was fain to unpray his prayers.” In another essay Le Sieur Michel\r\ntells how severely the gods punished the wicked prayers of Œdipus, in\r\ngranting them. “He had prayed that his children might amongst themselves\r\ndetermine the succession to his throne by arms: and was so miserable as\r\nto see himself taken at his word. We should not pray that all things fall\r\nout as our will would have them, but that our will should subserve what\r\nis just and right.” Owen Feltham records his having observed that what we\r\neither desire or fear doth seldom happen—something we think not of, for\r\nthe most part intervening. How infinitely we should perplex ourselves,\r\nhe exclaims, if we could obtain whatever we might wish for! “Do we not\r\noften desire that, which we afterwards see would be our confusion?...\r\nMan could not be more miserable, than if left to choose for himself....\r\nNothing brings destruction on him sooner, than when he presumes to part\r\nthe empire with God.” As Aricie warns Theseus in the French tragedy:\r\n\r\n    “Craignez, seigneur, craignez que le ciel rigoureux\r\n    Ne vous haïsse assez pour exaucer vos vœux.”\r\n\r\nAnd two scenes later Theseus is himself sufficiently of the same mind to\r\nexclaim:\r\n\r\n    “Ne précipite point tes funestes bienfaits,\r\n    Neptune! j’aime mieux n’être exaucé jamais.”\r\n\r\nAnd afterwards again he utters the tristful line:\r\n\r\n    “Inexorables dieux! qui m’avez trop servi.”\r\n\r\nSo in a subsequent passage:\r\n\r\n    “Je hais jusqu’aux soins dont m’honorent les dieux:\r\n    Et je m’en vais pleurer leurs faveurs meurtrières,\r\n    Sans plus les fatiguer d’inutiles prières.\r\n    Quoi qu’ils fissent pour moi, leur funeste bonté\r\n    Ne me saurait payer de ce qu’ils m’ont ôté.”\r\n\r\nMadame de Sévigné, in one of her letters to Bussy, moralizes on the\r\nsuperior wisdom of Heaven’s disposal to man’s proposal; and adds: “C’est\r\nainsi que nous marchons en aveugles, ne sachant où nous allons, prenant\r\npour mauvais ce qui est bon, prenant pour bon ce qui est mauvais, et\r\ntoujours dans une entière ignorance.” The optative mood of yesterday, a\r\npast tense, is changed in the present tense of to-day for deprecation and\r\nregret.\r\n\r\nIn one of his many onslaughts against conventionalism, Mr. Emerson says\r\nthat what we ask daily is to be conventional. “Supply, most kind gods!\r\nthis defect in my dress, in my form, in my fortunes, which puts me a\r\nlittle out of the ring; supply it, and let me be like the rest whom\r\nI admire, and on good terms with them.” But the wise gods, according\r\nto this essayist, reply, “No, we have better things for thee. By\r\nhumiliations, by defeats, by loss of sympathy, by gulfs of disparity,\r\nlearn a wider truth and humanity than that of a fine gentleman,”—a\r\nFifth-Avenue landlord, or a West-End householder, not being Mr. Emerson’s\r\nideal of the highest style of man. Æsop, Saadi, Cervantes, Regnard, he\r\nadds, have been taken by corsairs, left for dead, sold for slaves, and\r\nknow the realities of human life.—With Mr. Carlyle, we will not complain,\r\ntherefore, of Dante’s miseries; who, had all gone right with him, as he\r\nwished it, might have been Prior, Podestà, or whatsoever they call it,\r\nof Florence, well accepted among neighbours,—in which case, the world\r\nhad wanted one of the most notable works ever spoken or sung. “Florence\r\nwould have had another prosperous Lord Mayor; and the ten dumb centuries\r\ncontinued voiceless, and the ten other listening centuries (for there\r\nwill be ten of them and more) had no _Divina Comedia_ to hear! We will\r\ncomplain of nothing. A nobler destiny was appointed for this Dante; and\r\nhe, struggling like a man towards death and crucifixion, could not help\r\nfulfilling it. Give _him_ the choice of his happiness! He knew not, more\r\nthan we do, what was really happy, what was really miserable.”\r\n\r\nVisions, and hopes, and prospects, writes Horace Walpole, are pretty\r\nplaythings for boys. “It is folly to vex one’s self for what cannot last\r\nvery long. Indeed, what can, even when one is young? Corydon firmly\r\nbelieves he shall be wretched for ever if he does not marry Phyllis.\r\nThat misery can but last till she has lost her bloom. His eternal woe\r\nwould vanish if her nose grew red. How often do our griefs become our\r\ncomforts! I know what I wish to-day; not at all what I shall wish\r\nto-morrow. Sixty says, You did not wish for _me_, yet you would like\r\nto keep me. Sixty is in the right; and I have not a word more to say.”\r\nThe Strawberry Hill esquire was himself turning the shady side of sixty\r\nwhen he thus wrote. Of quite another school was that gentle and good Q.\r\nQ., as she styled herself, once popular, now almost forgotten, who thus\r\nmoralized her song:\r\n\r\n    “How false is found, as on in life we go,\r\n    Our early estimate of bliss or woe!\r\n    —Some sparkling joy attracts us, that we fain\r\n    Would sell a precious birthright to obtain:\r\n    There all our hopes of happiness are placed,\r\n    Life looks without it like a joyless waste;\r\n    No good is prized, no comfort sought beside,\r\n    Prayers, tears implore, and will not be denied:\r\n    Heaven pitying hears th’ intemperate, rude appeal,\r\n    And suits its answer to our truest weal.\r\n    The self-sought idol, if at last bestow’d,\r\n    Proves, what our wilfulness required—a goad.\r\n    Ne’er, but as needful chastisement, is given\r\n    The wish thus forced and torn and storm’d from Heaven;\r\n    But if withheld, in pity, from our prayer,\r\n    We rave, awhile, of torment and despair....\r\n    Meantime, Heaven bears the grievous wrong, and waits\r\n    In patient pity till the storm abates ...\r\n    Deigning, perhaps, to show the mourner soon,\r\n    ’Twas special mercy that denied the boon.”\r\n\r\nChateaubriand’s most sentimental of melancholy-mad heroes, overwhelmed,\r\nas he flatters himself, with imaginary sufferings, offers up a prayer\r\nfor some real calamity to overtake him; and, to his cost, is taken at\r\nhis word. “Dans mon délire, j’avais été jusqu’à désirer d’éprouver un\r\nmalheur, pour avoir du moins un objet réel de souffrance: épouvantable\r\nsouhait, que Dieu dans sa colère, a trop exaucé!” It is but the Christian\r\n(yet not too Christian) expression of the old pagan poet’s gloomy verse:\r\n_magnaque numinibus vota exaudita malignis_.\r\n\r\nThere is a sonnet of Filicaja’s, of which a good deal is made by\r\nRichardson in his History of Sir Charles Grandison,—the concluding\r\nlines being an impressive vindication of the ways of Providence to man:\r\n_Provvidenza alta infinita_, if it sometimes denies the favours we\r\nimplore, denies in kindness; and seeming to deny a blessing, grants one\r\nin that very refusal: _o negar finge, e nel negar concede_.\r\n\r\nWilliam Collins the painter—a loving and lovable man as well as refined\r\nartist—in one of his letters home expresses his “decided opinion, that if\r\nthe Almighty were to give us everything for which we feel desirous, we\r\nshould as often find it necessary to pray to Him to take away as to grant\r\nnew favours.” And he refers to thousands of cases that he could bring\r\nforward in proof of his assertion.\r\n\r\nIt amounts to a sort of refrain in the melodious rhythm of that\r\nfragmentary prose-poem of De Quincey’s, “The Daughter of Lebanon,”—the\r\nadmonition of the prophet to the lovely woman in the Damascus\r\nmarket-place: “Ask what thou wilt—great or small—and through me thou\r\nshalt receive it from God. But, my child, ask not amiss. For God is\r\nable out of thy own evil asking to weave snares for thy footing. And\r\noftentimes to the lambs whom He loves, He gives by seeming to refuse;\r\ngives in some better sense, or” (and here the prophet’s voice swelled\r\ninto the power of anthems) “in some far happier world.” And when the\r\nsun is declining to the west on the thirtieth day, the prophet iterates\r\nthe strain of old: “Lady of Lebanon, the day is already come, and the\r\nhour is coming, in which my covenant must be fulfilled with thee. Wilt\r\nthou, therefore, being now wiser in thy thoughts, suffer God, thy new\r\nFather, to give by seeming to refuse; to give in some better sense, or\r\nin some far happier world?” But the daughter of Lebanon sorrowed at\r\nthese words; she yearned after her native hills, and the sweet twin-born\r\nsister with whom from infant days hand-in-hand she had wandered amongst\r\nthe everlasting cedars. The delirium of fever, and approaching death,\r\nare next described; and again the evangelist sits down by her bedside,\r\nand rebukes the clouds that trouble her vision, and bids them stand\r\nno more between that dying Magdalen and the forests of Lebanon. Anon,\r\nwe read how the blue sky parted to the right and to the left, laying\r\nbare the infinite revelations that can be made visible only to dying\r\neyes; and how, as the child of Lebanon gazed upon the mighty visions,\r\nshe saw bending forward from the heavenly host, as if in gratulation to\r\nherself, the one countenance for which she hungered and thirsted. “The\r\ntwin-sister, that should have waited for her in Lebanon, had died of\r\ngrief, and was waiting for her in Paradise. Immediately in rapture she\r\nsoared upwards from her couch; immediately in weakness she fell back;\r\nand being caught by the evangelist, she flung her arms around his neck;\r\nwhilst he breathed into her ear his final whisper, ‘Wilt thou now suffer\r\nthat God should give by seeming to refuse?’—‘Oh yes—yes—yes,’ was the\r\nfervent answer from the daughter of Lebanon.” Hitherto she had known not\r\nwhat to ask for as she ought. Hitherto her asking had been amiss: she had\r\nasked for she knew not what. But now her vision was purged. Now she had\r\nthe second-sight that could pierce through and beyond the night-side of\r\nnature, and gaze on the land that is very far off. Hitherto she had, at\r\nthe best, seen through a glass darkly; but now, it might be said, face to\r\nface. So that she knew what to ask for, now.\r\n\r\nChactas, the blind old sachem in Chateaubriand’s Wertherian romance,\r\nis made to bring that once enthusiastically admired story to an end by\r\nrelating a parable to his woe-fraught young listener. It tells how the\r\nMeschacebé, soon after leaving its source among the hills, began to feel\r\nweary of being a simple brook; and so asked for snows from the mountains,\r\nwater from the torrents, rain from the tempests; until, its petitions\r\ngranted, it burst its bounds, and ravaged its hitherto delightsome banks.\r\nAt first the proud stream exulted in its force; but seeing ere long that\r\nit carried desolation in its flow, that its progress was now doomed to\r\nsolitude, and that its waters were for ever turbid, it came to regret the\r\nhumble bed hollowed out for it by nature,—the birds, the flowers, the\r\ntrees, and the brooks, hitherto the modest companions of its tranquil\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nThe moral of the myth of Tithonus is one for all time. Mr. Tennyson has\r\npointed it for ours. He shows us in Tithonus a white-haired shadow\r\nroaming like a dream the ever silent spaces of the East; and from this\r\ngrey shadow, once a man, the wailing utterance of a sad story comes:—\r\n\r\n    “I ask’d thee, ‘Give me immortality.’\r\n    Then didst thou grant my asking with a smile,\r\n    Like wealthy men who care not how they give.\r\n    But thy strong Hours indignant work’d their wills,\r\n    And beat me down and marr’d and wasted me,\r\n    And tho’ they could not end me, left me maim’d\r\n    To dwell in presence of immortal youth,\r\n    And all I was, in ashes....\r\n        ... Let me go: take back thy gift:\r\n    Why should a man desire in any way\r\n    To vary from the kindly race of men,\r\n    Or pass beyond the goal of ordinance\r\n    Where all should pass, as is most meet for all?\r\n    ...\r\n      Why wilt thou ever scare me with thy tears,\r\n    And make me tremble lest a saying learnt,\r\n    In days far off, on that dark earth, be true?\r\n    ‘The gods themselves cannot recal their gifts.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“_AND HE DIED._”\r\n\r\nGENESIS v. _passim_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWell known is Addison’s reference to an eminent man in the Romish Church,\r\nwho upon reading in the Book of Genesis how that all the days that Adam\r\nlived were nine hundred and thirty years, and he died; and all the\r\ndays of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died; and all\r\nthe days of Methuselah were nine hundred and sixty nine years, and he\r\ndied;—immediately shut himself up in a convent, an absolute recluse from\r\nthe world, as not thinking anything in this life worth pursuing, which\r\nhad not regard to another.\r\n\r\nWhat man is he that liveth, and shall not see death?\r\n\r\n    “Dead!—Man’s ‘I was,’ by God’s ‘I am’—\r\n    All hero-worship comes to that.\r\n    High heart, high thought, high fame, as flat\r\n    As a gravestone. Bring your _Jacet jam_—\r\n    The epitaph’s an epigram.”\r\n\r\nSo writes Mrs. Browning. And thus writes Barry Cornwall, on the same\r\ntrite text; it is the last stanza of the History of a Life, and of a\r\nsuccessful one:—\r\n\r\n    “And then—he died. Behold before ye\r\n    Humanity’s poor sum and story;\r\n    Life—death—and all that is of glory.”\r\n\r\nAnd again, in the same poet’s chanson of the time of Charlemagne, the\r\nstanza that magnifies that hero-king, and tells how he fought and\r\nvanquished Lombard, Saxon, Saracen, and ruled every race he conquered\r\nwith a deep consummate skill—is followed by one beginning,\r\n\r\n    “But—he died! and he was buried\r\n    In his tomb of sculptured stone,” etc.\r\n\r\nAnd once again, in one of this author’s dramatic fragments is sketched\r\nthe career of what Mr. Carlyle would call a “foiled potentiality”—of one\r\nwho, in favourable circumstances, might have been, but who in prosaic\r\nreality and the matter-of-fact pressure of this work-a-day world, never\r\nactually became, great. Had he but lived under better auspices, he would\r\nhave been—\r\n\r\n    _B._                “A king?\r\n\r\n    _A._           A _man_! what else,\r\n    King, emperor, tyrant, shah, would matter not.\r\n    He would have been—a name; such as of old\r\n    Grew into gods!\r\n\r\n    _B._              And so he died?\r\n\r\n    _A._                              He died.”\r\n\r\nDeath stands everywhere in the background, as the elder Schlegel says in\r\nhis analysis of the elements of tragic poetry, and to it every well or\r\nill-spent moment brings us nearer and closer; and even when a man has\r\nbeen so singularly fortunate as to reach the utmost term of life without\r\nany grievous calamity, the inevitable doom still awaits him to leave or\r\nto be left by all that is most dear to him on earth. In the words, most\r\nmusical, most melancholy, of the laureate,\r\n\r\n    “The woods decay, the woods decay and fall,\r\n    The vapours weep their burthen to the ground;\r\n    Man comes and tills the field, and lies beneath;\r\n    And after many a summer dies the swan.”\r\n\r\nAddison, in another essay than that already referred to, describes an\r\nafternoon he passed in Westminster Abbey, straying through and lingering\r\nin the churchyard, the cloisters, and the church, “amusing himself,” as\r\nthe phrase then ran—not quite in our frivolous sense—with the tombstones\r\nand the inscriptions that he met with in those several regions of the\r\ndead, most of which recorded nothing else of the buried person, but that\r\nhe was born upon one day, and died upon another; the whole history of\r\nhis life being comprehended in those two circumstances that are common\r\nto all mankind. The “Spectator” could not but look upon these registers\r\nof existence, whether of brass or marble, as a kind of satire upon the\r\ndeparted persons, who had left no other memorial of them but that they\r\nwere born, and that they died. Mr. de Quincey characteristically opened\r\nhis autobiographic sketches in their original form, with the avowal that\r\nnothing makes such dreary and monotonous reading as the old hackneyed\r\nroll-call, chronologically arranged, of inevitable facts in a man’s\r\nlife. “One is so certain of the man’s having been born, and also of his\r\nhaving died, that it is dismal to be under the necessity of reading it.”\r\nThe man—a man—any man—every man. It is the common lot. And we know what\r\nJames Montgomery has made of the Common Lot. Here are two or three of the\r\nstanzas that are most to the purpose:—\r\n\r\n    “Once in the flight of ages past,\r\n      There lived a man: and who was he?\r\n    Mortal! howe’er thy lot be cast,\r\n      That man resembled thee.\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    “He suffered,—but his pangs are o’er;\r\n      Enjoy’d,—but his delights are fled;\r\n    Had friends,—his friends are now no more;\r\n      And foes,—his foes are dead.\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    “He saw whatever thou hast seen;\r\n      Encounter’d all that troubles thee:\r\n    He was—whatever thou hast been;\r\n      He is—what thou shalt be.\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    “The annals of the human race,\r\n      Their ruins, since the world began,\r\n    Of him, afford no other trace\r\n      Than this,—THERE LIVED A MAN!”\r\n\r\nThere lived a man—lived, and loved, and learned, and laboured—enjoyed the\r\ncommon joys of his kind, endured the common sufferings. AND HE DIED. Old\r\nEgeus mooted a veritable truism when moralizing thus, in Chaucer:—\r\n\r\n    “Yit ither ne lyvede never man, he seyde,\r\n    In al this world, that some tyme he ne deyde.”\r\n\r\nA French historian comments on this characteristic of old cloister\r\nchronicles, that the obscurest event of the cloister holds in them as\r\nconspicuous a place as the greatest revolutions in history. For instance,\r\nin a chronicle cited by him of the year of grace 732, which produced\r\nthe battle of Poictiers, whereby Charles Martel arrested the vast\r\ninvasion of Islamism, not a line is vouchsafed to that event. In fact,\r\nthe year is passed over without notice, as containing nothing really\r\ndeserving of notice. But beside a date expressly given, we read, “Martin\r\nest mort,”—Martin being an unknown monk of the Abbey of Corvey; and,\r\nfarther on again, “Charles, maire du palais, est mort.” Martin was an\r\nunknown monk, and he died. Charles Martel was mayor of the palace, and\r\nthe conqueror at Poictiers, and he died. Well remarks M. Demogeot, that\r\n“tous les hommes deviennent egaux devant la secheresse laconique de ces\r\npremiers chroniqueurs.” “We must all go, that is certain,” writes Mrs.\r\nPiozzi to Sir James Fellows, “and ’tis the only thing that _is_ certain.\r\nΚαὶ ἀπεθανε ends all the cases Dr. James quotes from your old friend\r\nHippocrates.” All the physician’s cases have the same terminal affix, AND\r\nHE DIED. Very long-lived some of them may be; but, as Mr. Browning puts\r\nit in his fine poem of “Saul,”\r\n\r\n    “But the licence of age has its limit; thou diest at last.”\r\n\r\nWe are told of St. Anschar, whose missionary career in Sweden is\r\ncommemorated in Milman’s “Latin Christianity,” that the ardour of youth\r\nhad begun to relax his strict austerity of monastic discipline, when all\r\nat once the world was startled by the tidings of Charlemagne’s death.\r\nThat the mighty sovran of so many kingdoms must suffer the common lot,\r\nstruck young Anschar as something beyond the common; and from that hour\r\nhe lived in the world as not of it, and bore on his way through it as\r\nverily a stranger and a pilgrim upon earth, with serious work to do, but\r\nworking in and walking by faith, not sight.\r\n\r\nMarcus Antoninus, in his self-communings, bids himself consider how many\r\nphysicians are dead that used to value themselves upon the cure of their\r\npatients, and how many astrologers who thought themselves great men by\r\nforetelling the deaths of others; how many warriors, who had knocked out\r\nthe brains of thousands upon thousands; and how many tyrants who managed\r\nthe power of life and death with as much rigour as if they had been\r\nthemselves immortal.\r\n\r\nAmong the pointed sayings that have been thought worthy of\r\npreservation—by Gibbon, for example—of Hormisdas, a fugitive prince\r\nof Persia, who was at Rome in the fourth century, is this,—“that one\r\nthing only had displeased him, to find that men died at Rome as well as\r\nelsewhere.” Courtiers have avowed themselves shocked at the non-exception\r\nof royalty from the universal doom. A courtly preacher, who had announced\r\nthe unconditional fact that we are all mortal, is said to have checked\r\nhimself, on remembering that royalty was present, and to have qualified\r\nthe assertion by the circumspect salvo, “At least, nearly all.”[16]\r\nLewis the Eleventh was too shrewd a man to give heed to such courtly\r\nsuggestions; otherwise, if ever there were prince that would fain have\r\nbelieved the fiction, it was he, so abhorrent to his shuddering nature\r\nwas the imagination of his own decease. And Commines relates how\r\nphysicians combined their remedies with the sacred objects produced from\r\nthe sanctuary to avert the dread decree, “pour lui allonger la vie.\r\nToutefois le tout n’y fasoit rien; et falloit qu’il passât par là où les\r\nautres ont passés.” And he died. All stories have the same ending.\r\n\r\n    “The Frenchman first in literary fame;\r\n    Mention him, if you please. Voltaire? The same,\r\n    With spirit, genius, eloquence supplied,\r\n    Lived long, wrote much, laughed heartily—and died.”\r\n\r\nThat very old poet, Stephen Hawes, for discovering in whom “one fine\r\nline,” Warton was called “the indulgent historian of our poetry,” tells\r\nhis own life-story quite to an end, including the particulars of his\r\nfuneral and epitaph. A finer critic than Warton, or than Warton’s critic,\r\nbids those who smile at the design dismiss their levity before the poet’s\r\nutterance:—\r\n\r\n    “O! mortal folke, you may beholde and see\r\n      Howe I lye here, sometime a mighty knight.\r\n    The end of joye and prosperitie\r\n      Is death at last thorough his course and might.\r\n      After the day there cometh the dark night,\r\n      For though the day appear ever so long,\r\n      At last the bell ringeth to evensong—”\r\n\r\n“Ringeth,” says Mrs. Browning, “in our ear with a soft and solemn music,\r\nto which the soul is prodigal of echoes.”\r\n\r\nWhat—asks the most meditative of Roman emperors, in his Meditations,\r\ndiscussing with himself the ultimate fate, often reluctantly undergone,\r\nof certain long-lived persons—what are they more than those who went off\r\nin their infancy? What is become of Cæcilianus, Fabius, Julianus, and\r\nLepidus? Their heads are all laid somewhere. They buried a great many;\r\nbut at last they came to be buried themselves. Mr. Dickens, as well as\r\nHervey, has his meditations among the tombs,—and these are of them in\r\nthe little hemmed-in churchyards of the city—these, over an old tree\r\nat the church window, with no room for its branches, that has seen out\r\ngeneration after generation of civic worthies: “So with the tomb of the\r\nold Master of the Company, on which it drips. His son restored it, and\r\ndied; his daughter restored it, and died; and then he had been remembered\r\nlong enough, and the tree took possession of him, and his name cracked\r\nout.” To quote Chaucer again:\r\n\r\n    “That is to seyn, in youthe or elles in age,\r\n    He moot ben deed, the kyng as schal a page.”\r\n\r\nCranmer’s transported prevision, in Shakspeare, of the grand future that\r\nawaited the infant princess Elizabeth, is dashed with sadness towards the\r\nend—the strain subsiding into a minor key—by the unwelcome but inevitable\r\nreflection, “But she must die.” So muses and moralises Talbot again, in\r\nanother of the historical plays:\r\n\r\n    “But kings and mightiest potentates must die;\r\n    For that’s the end of human misery.”\r\n\r\nAnd Warwick, in another of them, finding that, of all his lands, is\r\nnothing left him but his body’s length, exclaims, as one that at last\r\nfeels it feelingly,\r\n\r\n    “Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?\r\n    And, live we how we can, yet die we must.”\r\n\r\nAnd once more in yet another of them, when King John dies, and Salisbury\r\nwitnessing the death, exclaims, “But now a king—now thus!” the prince who\r\nis to succeed takes home the lesson to himself, and confesses, in diction\r\nborrowed from the mere machinery of clockwork,\r\n\r\n    “Even so must I run on, and even so stop.”\r\n\r\nIn exhibiting to Odysseus in the shades below a group of the fairest and\r\nmost famous of women, Homer has been supposed by some of his commentators\r\nto have designed a lecture on mortality to the whole sex. Tertullian’s\r\ntrumpet is blown with no uncertain sound when _he_ thus addresses the\r\nfrivolous fair of his day: “I have said, ye are gods, and ye are all\r\nthe children of the Most High.... But, O gods of flesh and blood, O\r\ngods of earth and dust, ye shall die like men, and all your glory shall\r\nfall to the ground, _veruntamen sicut homines moriemini_.” This is in\r\nTertullian’s description of the vain and prodigal and exacting beauty.\r\nSuggestive in its way is an anecdote related by Mrs. Thrale about Sir\r\nJoshua Reynolds’s picture of two fashionable belles, Mrs. Crewe and Mrs.\r\nBouverie, attired as two shepherdesses, and with this motto attached,\r\n_Et in Arcadiâ ego_. What could that mean? is Dr. Johnson said to have\r\nasked. Reynolds replied that the king could have told him: “_He_ saw it\r\nyesterday, and said at once, ‘Oh, there is a tombstone in the background.\r\nAy, ay, death is even in Arcadia.’” The thought is said to have been\r\nborrowed from Poussin—where some gay revellers stumble over a death’s\r\nhead, with a scroll proceeding from its mouth, saying, Et in Arcadiâ\r\n_ego_.\r\n\r\nMemorable at Saladin’s banquet to Richard and his peers—ever memorable\r\namong the banners and pennons, the trophies of battles won and kingdoms\r\noverthrown, is the long lance displaying a shroud, “the banner of Death,\r\nwith this impressive inscription—‘Saladin, King of Kings—Saladin, Victor\r\nof Victors—Saladin must Die.’”\r\n\r\nPoet Prior laments with courtly distress the inflexible fact that the\r\nBritish monarch, to whom he is addressing his _carmen seculare_ for the\r\nyear of grace MDCC., must go the way of all flesh:\r\n\r\n    “But a relentless destiny\r\n      Urges all that e’er was born:\r\n      Snatch’d from her arms, Britannia once must mourn\r\n    The demi-god; the earthly half must die.”\r\n\r\nFor as Master Matthew puts it in another ode:—\r\n\r\n    “Alike must every state and every age\r\n    Sustain the universal tyrant’s rage;\r\n    For neither William’s power nor Mary’s charms\r\n    Could, or repel, or pacify his arms.\r\n    ...\r\n    Wisdom and eloquence in vain would plead\r\n    One moment’s respite for the learned head:\r\n    Judges of writings and of men have died\r\n    (Mæcenas, Sackville, Socrates, and Hyde);\r\n    And in their various turns their sons must tread\r\n    Those gloomy journeys which their sires have led.\r\n\r\n      “The ancient sage, who did so long maintain\r\n    That bodies die, but souls return again,\r\n    With all the births and deaths he had in store\r\n    Went out Pythagoras, and came no more.\r\n    And modern Asgill,[17] whose capricious thought\r\n    Is yet with stores of wilder notions fraught,\r\n    Too soon convinced, shall yield that fleeting breath\r\n    Which played so idly with the darts of death.”\r\n\r\nThe truism appears to have been a favourite theme with Prior, who\r\nexpatiates upon it in a variety of keys. Here is one other specimen from\r\nhis stores, in octosyllabic metre:—\r\n\r\n    “All must obey the general doom,\r\n    Down from Alcides to Tom Thumb.\r\n    Grim Pluto will not be withstood\r\n    By force or craft. Tall Robin Hood,\r\n    As well as Little John, is dead—\r\n    (You see how deeply I am read).”\r\n\r\nDoes not Cervantes begin the last chapter of his great work with the\r\nreflection that, as all human things, especially the lives of men, are\r\ntransitory, ever advancing to their decline and final termination, so\r\n“Don Quixote was favoured by no privilege of exemption from the common\r\nfate,” for the period of his dissolution came when he least thought of\r\nit—and he died.\r\n\r\nDeath’s final conquest is the subject of a fine poem of James Shirley’s;\r\nthe piece by which he is, in every sense, best remembered. How death\r\nlays his icy hands on kings, is there told with pitiless candour; and\r\nthe merry monarch, _par excellence_, Charles the Second, is said to have\r\ngreatly admired the poetry, if not the candour, of Shirley’s strain.\r\nEarly or late, all stoop to fate; that is the trite topic. But the moral\r\nis noble, and nobly expressed. The poet reminds laurelled victors that\r\nthe garlands are withering on their brow, and that soon upon death’s\r\npurple altar shall the “victor victim” bleed:—\r\n\r\n    “All heads must come\r\n    To the cold tomb;\r\n    Only the actions of the just\r\n    Smell sweet and blossom in the dust.”\r\n\r\nThe first verse only of George Herbert’s “Virtue” is familiar to men; all\r\nfour have a music and a meaning of their own:—\r\n\r\n    “Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright,\r\n      The bridal of the earth and sky,\r\n    The dew shall weep thy fall to-night;\r\n                For thou must die.\r\n\r\n    “Sweet rose, whose hue angry and brave\r\n      Bids the rash gazer wipe his eye,\r\n    Thy root is ever in its grave,\r\n                And thou must die.\r\n\r\n    “Sweet spring, full of sweet days and roses,\r\n      A box where sweets compacted lie,\r\n    My music shows ye have your closes,\r\n                And all must die.\r\n\r\n    “Only a sweet and virtuous soul,\r\n      Like seasoned timber, never gives;\r\n    But though the whole world turn to coal,\r\n                Then chiefly lives.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_AN ULTRA-PROTESTER._\r\n\r\nST. MATTHEW xxvi. 33-35, 69-75.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo have written it ultra-Protestant, would mislead into an expectation\r\nof polemical matter, offensive to Orangeism, and entirely alien\r\nfrom the purpose. For who is the hyper-protester, not to write it\r\nultra-Protestant, of whom we speak? None other than St. Peter.\r\nNominally the first Pope. But let that pass. Whether technically an\r\nultra-Protestant or not,—let that pass too. It is with his surplusage\r\nof protestations, vehemently asserted, and anon ignominiously ignored,\r\nthat we are at present concerned. Though all men, all, should be offended\r\nbecause of Christ, should stumble and fall because of Him, yet would he\r\nnever be offended, never stumble, never lose his footing, firm as a rock,\r\nfirm as his own name, Peter, Cephas; a rock on which the Church was to be\r\nbuilt. The protest of the apostle won no meed of thanks and assurance\r\nof conviction from his Lord. He who needed not that any should testify\r\nof man, for He knew what was in man—and knew what was wanting in _this_\r\nman,—waved aside, as absolutely worthless, the perfervid protestations\r\nof the impulsive son of Jonas. Thrice should Peter deny Him before dawn\r\nof another day. Deny Him? Had it come to that? The protester must become\r\nultra in his protests. “Though I should die with Thee, yet will I not\r\ndeny Thee!” It would be beside the mark here to take into account the\r\nother _voces et præterea nihil_, echoing the same thing—protested notes\r\nat the best—for likewise also said all the disciples. Peter is their\r\nrepresentative man, and ours.\r\n\r\nGertrude’s comment in “Hamlet,” on the accumulated asseverations of the\r\nstage-queen, “The lady doth protest too much, methinks,” has passed into\r\na proverb. “The more vehemently they assert, the less credit they obtain\r\nfor sincerity,” observes Hartley Coleridge, of some examples of impulsive\r\nwomankind. Racine’s Bérénice turns the tables on Titus in this regard,\r\nwhen she tells him,\r\n\r\n    “Hé quoi! vous me jurez une éternelle ardeur,\r\n    Et vous me la jurez avec cette froideur!\r\n    Pourquoi même du ciel attester la puissance?\r\n    Faut-il par des serments vaincre ma défiance?\r\n    Mon cœur ne prétend point, seigneur, vous démentir;\r\n    Et je vous en croirai sur un simple soupir.”\r\n\r\nHow fulsome and hollow, exclaims Marcus Antoninus, does that man look\r\nwho cries, “I’m resolved to deal clearly with you.” Hark you, friend,\r\nthe philosophic emperor addresses him, “what need of all this flourish?\r\nlet your actions speak.” Mr. Disraeli, in his earliest book, has an\r\neloquent paragraph on “that eagerness of protestation which,” in the man\r\ncharged with criminality, “is a sure sign of crime.” There is as much of\r\noveracting one’s part on the great stage of life, as on the mimic boards;\r\nand that with graver issues and a drearier fate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the subtle and ambitious John of Gischala, pursuing his own dark\r\ncourse, as it is traced in the “History of the Jews,” joined outwardly\r\nthe party of Ananus, and was active beyond others in council and camp, he\r\nyet kept up a secret correspondence with the Zealots, to whom he betrayed\r\nall the movements of the assailants. “To conceal this secret he redoubled\r\nhis assiduities, and became so extravagant in his protestations of\r\nfidelity to Ananus and his party, that he completely over-acted his part,\r\nand incurred suspicion.” His intended dupes began gradually, and none too\r\nsoon, to look with a jealous eye on their too obsequious, most obedient,\r\nand most devoted servant.\r\n\r\nDescribing the ten dreary years during which (A.D. 1198-1208), with but\r\nshort intervals of truce, Germany was abandoned to all the horrors of\r\ncivil war, Dean Milman observes that “the repeated protestations” of\r\nPope Innocent III., that _he_ was not the cause of these fatal discords,\r\nbetray the fact that he was accused of the guilt, and that he had to\r\nwrestle with his own conscience to acquit himself of the charge. Sir\r\nThomas Overbury suggestively avers that\r\n\r\n    “He that says oft that he is not in love,\r\n    By repetition doth himself disprove.”\r\n\r\nHawthorne remarks that Italian asseverations of any questionable\r\nfact, though uttered with rare earnestness of manner, never vouch\r\nfor themselves as coming from any depth, like roots drawn out of the\r\nsubstance of the soul, with some of the soil clinging to them. Their\r\nenergy expends itself in exclamation. The vaulting ambition of their\r\nhyperboles overleaps itself, and falls on the other side. Swift refers\r\nto oaths in the mouth of a gamester, as ever most used as their truth is\r\nmost questioned.\r\n\r\n    “’Tis not the many oaths that make the truth,\r\n    But the plain single vow, that is vowed true,”\r\n\r\nsays Shakspeare’s Diana of Florence. And though from Shakspeare to Wolcot\r\nis a descent indeed, Peter Pindar is for once quotable when he writes,\r\n\r\n    “Truth needs not, John, the eloquence of oaths,\r\n    Not more so than a decent suit of clothes\r\n    Requires of broad gold lace the expensive glare,\r\n    That makes the linsey-woolsey million stare;\r\n    Besides, a proverb, suited to my wish,\r\n    Declares that swearing never catches fish.”\r\n\r\nThat scapegrace guardian of George Canning’s boyhood, Mr. Reddish, is\r\nsaid to have been significantly fond, on quite trivial occasions, of\r\nmaking affidavits,—“the refuge of base and vulgar minds,” Robert Bell\r\ncalls them,—as if he, Reddish, felt that his word was not to be believed.\r\nCowper is caustic in his application of St. Paul’s statement, that oaths\r\nterminate all strife, for “some men have surely then a peaceful life!” he\r\ninfers, in lines that go on to tell how\r\n\r\n    “Asseveration blustering in your face\r\n    Makes contradiction such a hopeless case;\r\n    In every tale they tell, or false or true,\r\n    Well-known, or such as no man ever knew,\r\n    They fix attention, heedless of your pain,\r\n    With oaths like rivets forced into the brain;\r\n    And e’en when sober truth prevails throughout,\r\n    They swear it, till affirmance breeds a doubt.”\r\n\r\nThe imprecation of Corneille’s Dorante, _Que le foudre à vos yeux\r\nm’écrase si je mens!_ only evokes from Clarice the contemptuous rebuff,\r\n_Un menteur_ [which, and more than which, emphatically, Dorante is,\r\nfor he is _Le Menteur_,] _est toujours prodigue de serments_. So again\r\nRacine’s Theseus: _Toujours les scélérats ont recours au parjure_,—when\r\nHippolytus begins to call heaven, and earth, and universal nature to\r\nwitness, etc. So, too, Chamont, in Otway’s tragedy: “When a man talks\r\nof love, with caution trust him; but if he swears, he’ll certainly\r\ndeceive thee.” Indeed, as Owen Feltham has it, wherever there is too\r\nmuch profession, there is cause for suspicion. “Reality cares not to be\r\ntricked out with too taking an outside; and deceit, when she intends to\r\ncozen, studies disguise. Least of all should we be taken with swearing\r\nasseverations. Truth needs not the varnish of an oath to make her\r\nplainness credited.” Fielding’s Pettifogger, on a certain occasion,\r\ncalling to mind that he had not been sworn, as he usually was, before he\r\ngave his evidence, “now bound what he had declared with so many oaths\r\nand imprecations, that the landlady’s ears were shocked, and she put a\r\nstop to his swearing, by assuring him of her belief,” inconsiderately\r\nenough, as the manner of the man might have proved. Scott’s Jorworth,\r\nwhen heaping asseveration on asseveration, is cut short by the honest\r\nFleming he is striving to mislead: “Stop, good Jorworth; thou heapest\r\nthine oaths too thickly on each other, for me to value them to the\r\nright estimate; that which is so lightly pledged, is sometimes thought\r\nnot worth redeeming.” So again Monkbarns tells the gaberlunzie, after\r\nhearing his story of the adept, “I am strongly disposed to believe that\r\nyou have spoken the truth, the rather, that you have not made any of\r\nthose obtestations of the superior powers, which I observe you and your\r\ncomrades always make use of when you mean to deceive folks.” The author\r\nof “London Labour and the London Poor,” recounts the redundance of “Glory\r\nbe to God! it’s the thruth I’m telling of you, sir,” etc., etc.; which he\r\nhad to hear from Irish mendicity, or mendacity, or both. “The dignity of\r\ntruth is lost with much protesting,” the Cicero of Jonson’s “Catiline”\r\nsays.\r\n\r\nTake up any ordinary history, and you are but too sure to come across\r\nexamples enough and to spare, of people who did protest too much, and did\r\nnot keep their word. Glance at Alison’s big book, and on one page you\r\nread, of Napper Tandy, for instance, “But the conduct of this leader was\r\nfar from keeping pace with these vehement protestations; for no sooner\r\ndid he hear of the reverse sustained by the French corps which had landed\r\nin Killala Bay, than he re-embarked on board the French brig _Anacreon_,\r\nand got safe across the channel.” On another we have Tippoo Saib striving\r\nto disarm the suspicions of the British Government by “professions of\r\neternal gratitude and attachment,” and considerably overacting his part.\r\nOn another we have Napoleon bidding Marmont “spare no protestations of\r\nassistance to Turkey;” and himself assuring the Turkish ambassador that,\r\n“his right hand was not more inseparable from his left, than the Sultan\r\nSelim should ever be to him;” in consequence of which protestations,\r\nTurkey threw herself into the breach against both Russia and England,\r\nonly to find the imperial ultra-protester, within one little month from\r\nthe protestations, arranging for the immediate partition, with the Czar,\r\nof the Turkish dominions. Look, again, at Benjamin Constant, launching\r\nhis vehement philippic against Napoleon, in the _Journal des Débats_ on\r\nthe eve of the Emperor’s return from Elba, and declaring, “Never will\r\nI crawl, like a base deserter from power to power. Under Louis XVIII.\r\nwe enjoy a representative government. Under Bonaparte we endured a\r\ngovernment of Mamelukes. He is an Attila, a Gengis Khan!” And then we\r\nread how, a few days after this fulmination, Constant, the _in_constant,\r\nbecame a councillor of state under this Attila, an active supporter of\r\nthis Gengis Khan. Another ground of indictment against Napoleon is found\r\nby Alison in the eagerness of his protestations to Russia, that he had no\r\nway connived at the election of Bernadotte to the throne of Sweden, when\r\nnext vacant. “The extreme anxiety which Napoleon evinced for some time\r\nafterwards to convince the court of St. Petersburg that he had taken no\r\nconcern in this election, only renders it the more probable that he was\r\nin reality at the bottom of the transaction.” The asseverations commenced\r\nby the younger Pennyboy, in Jonson’s “Staple of News,” are declined and\r\ndismissed, by the elder, who knows their worth, with this summary and\r\nsuggestive caution:\r\n\r\n    “No vows, no promises; too much protestation\r\n    Makes that suspected oft, we would persuade.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_FLEETING SHADOWS._\r\n\r\nJOB xiv. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble; as\r\nhe is said to come forth like a flower, only to be cut down, so is it\r\nfurther said of him, that “he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth\r\nnot.” His days are like a shadow that declineth. He himself is gone as a\r\nshadow that fleeteth away. For man is vanity, his days are as a shadow,\r\nsaith the psalmist. And the preacher, whose text is vanity of vanities,\r\nall is vanity, finds vexation of spirit in meditations on man, all the\r\ndays of whose vain life he spendeth as a shadow.\r\n\r\n_What shadows we are, and what shadows we pursue!_ The exclamation\r\nwas that of a great statesman, amid the excitement and the contests\r\nof public life, when there reached him news of the sudden death of a\r\nfellow-candidate and colleague. Shadow-hunted shadows. The pursued and\r\nthe pursuers—the game and the sportsmen—shadows all. Burke’s exclamation\r\nwas often in the mind of the late Sir James Graham, and, towards the\r\nclose of his life, not unfrequently on his lips.\r\n\r\n    “Ὁρῶ γὰρ ἡμᾶς οὐδὲν ὄντας ἄλλο, πλὴν\r\n    Εἰδωλ’, ὅσοιπερ ζῶμεν, ἤ κούφην ΣΚΙΑΝ.”\r\n\r\n_O curas hominum! O quantum est in rebus inane!_ Men were ever of old,\r\nand they are found to be now, the willing victims of illusion in all\r\nstages of life: children, youths, adults, and old men, all, as Emerson\r\nputs it, are led by one bauble or another. “There are as many pillows of\r\nillusion as flakes in a snow-storm. We wake from one dream into another\r\ndream. The toys, to be sure, are various, and are graduated in refinement\r\nto the quality of the dupe.” For instance, the intellectual man requires\r\na fine bait, while the sots are easily amused. “But everybody is drugged\r\nwith his own frenzy, and the pageant marches at all hours, with music and\r\nbanner and badge.” Shadows before, and shadows behind, and all fleeting.\r\nFalse glozing pleasures, to adopt George Herbert’s diction, are the\r\nshadowy lure,\r\n\r\n                    ... “casks of happiness,\r\n    Foolish night-fires, women’s and children’s wishes,\r\n      Chases in arras, gilded emptiness,\r\n        Shadows well mounted, dreams in a career,\r\n    Embroider’d lies, nothing between two dishes,—\r\n        These are the pleasures here.”\r\n\r\nMarcus Antoninus, in his “Meditations,” harps on the note of\r\nshadow-hunting or shadow-hunted shadows. You will soon be reduced to\r\nashes and a skeleton, he keeps telling himself; and even if you leave\r\na name,—what is a name? what is in a name? _Vox et præterea nihil._ The\r\nshadows you, a shade, pursue, are miserably shadowy. The prizes of life\r\nare, he says, so paltry, that to scuffle for them is ridiculous, and puts\r\nhim in mind of a set of puppies snarling for a bone, or of the contests\r\nof children for a toy. Wherever he looks, the wide world over, and in\r\nwhatever age of its history, he sees abundance of people very busy, and\r\nbig with their projects, who presently drop off, and moulder to dust and\r\nashes. The freshest laurels wither apace, and the echoes of Fame are soon\r\nsilenced. The “insect youth” that people the air and make it murmurous\r\nwith busy life,—is not their close resemblance to the children of men one\r\nof poetry’s common-places?\r\n\r\n    “To Contemplation’s sober eye,\r\n      Such is the race of man;\r\n    And they that creep, and they that fly,\r\n      Shall end where they began.\r\n\r\n    “Alike the busy and the gay,\r\n    But flutter through life’s little day,\r\n    In fortune’s varying colours drest;\r\n      Brushed by the hand of rough Mischance,\r\n      Or chilled by Age, their airy dance\r\n    They leave, in dust to rest.”\r\n\r\nHaving asked to be told her fortune by the Wise Wight of Mucklestane\r\nMoor, Miss Ildeston, in Scott’s story, is told by the cynical recluse,\r\nthat it is a simple one; an endless chase through life after follies\r\nnot worth catching, and when caught, successively thrown away—a chase,\r\npursued from the days of tottering infancy to those of old age upon his\r\ncrutches. “Toys and merry-making in childhood—love and its absurdities in\r\nyouth—spadille and basto in age, shall succeed each other as objects of\r\npursuit: flowers and butterflies in spring,—butterflies and thistledown\r\nin summer,—withered leaves in autumn and winter—all pursued, all caught,\r\nall flung aside.” _Que vont elles faire de si grand matin_, Cleopas asks\r\nhis demon-guide, concerning _ces personnes_ whose early rising and eager\r\nbustle have caught and fixed his attention. “Ce que vous souhaitez de\r\nsavoir, reprit le Démon, est une chose digne d’être observée. Vous allez\r\nvoir un tableau des soins, des mouvements, des peines que les pauvres\r\nmortels se donnent pendant cette vie, pour remplir, le plus agréablement\r\nqu’il leur est possible, ce petit éspace qui est entre leur naissance et\r\nleur mort.” _Telle est la vie_, as most of us live it.\r\n\r\n                    “Dream after dream ensues,\r\n    And still they dream that they shall still succeed,\r\n    And still are disappointed,”\r\n\r\nwrites William Cowper. Not at all in the same measure or manner, but\r\npretty much to the same effect, writes the picturesque poet of Bells and\r\nPomegranates:\r\n\r\n    “It is but to keep the nerves at strain,\r\n      To dry one’s eyes and laugh at a fall,\r\n    And baffled, get up to begin again,—\r\n      So the chase take up one’s life, that’s all.\r\n    While, look but once from your farthest bound,\r\n      At me so deep in the dust and dark,\r\n    No sooner the old hope drops to ground\r\n      Than a new one, straight to the self-same mark\r\n            I shape me—ever removed.”\r\n\r\nThere is much that is suggestive in the Abbé Gerbet’s discoursings in\r\nthe Catacombs at Rome. “Ce dernier calque de l’homme,” he says, in what\r\nhas been called a commentary on Bossuet’s _mot_, that the corpse of\r\na man becomes a _je ne sais quoi_, for which there is no name in any\r\nlanguage—“cette forme si vague, si effacée, à peine empreinte sur une\r\npoussière à peu près impalpable, volatile, presque transparente, d’un\r\nblanc mat et incertain, est ce qui donne le mieux quelque idée de ce que\r\nles anciens appelaient une _ombre_. Cette forme est plus frêle que l’aile\r\nd’un papillon, plus prompte à s’evanouir que la goutte de rosée suspendue\r\nà un brin d’herbe au soleil; un peu d’air agité par votre main, un\r\nsouffle, un son deviennent ici des agents puissants qui peuvent anéantir\r\nen une seconde ce que dix-sept siècles, peut-être, de destruction ont\r\népargné. Voyez,—vous venez de respirer, et la forme a disparu. Voilà la\r\nfin de l’histoire de l’homme en ce monde.” What shadows we are! Ashes to\r\nashes ends, even in Westminster Abbey, man’s noblest story, and dust to\r\ndust concludes his noblest song.\r\n\r\n    “O death all-eloquent! you only prove\r\n    What dust we doat on, when ’tis man we love.”\r\n\r\nHawthorne’s Gervayse Hastings is a type and symbol, when he describes\r\nhimself as depressed by a haunting perception of unreality; as one to\r\nwhom all things, all persons, are like shadows flickering on the wall.\r\n“Neither have I myself any real existence,” he says, “but am a shadow\r\nlike the rest.” And the end—not to say the moral—of his story may serve\r\nto remind us of the Abbé Gerbet’s words. Gervayse Hastings is seated with\r\nother guests at a feast—of very odd fellows—over whom is suspended the\r\nskeleton of the oddest of all, the founder of the feast. As the speaker\r\nceased his confession of shadowy experiences, “it so chanced that at this\r\njuncture the decayed ligaments of the skeleton gave way, and the dry\r\nbones fell together in a heap.... The attention of the company being thus\r\ndiverted for a single instant from Gervayse Hastings, they perceived on\r\nturning again towards him, that the old man had undergone a change. His\r\nshadow had ceased to flicker on the wall.” The woe of this old man was,\r\nthat to him the world to come was all shadow too.\r\n\r\nMrs. Schimmelpenninck expresses her belief that in youth and middle age\r\nthere is often a real conviction of the transitory nature of the most\r\nestablished temporal things, but that in old age it is not merely a\r\nconviction, but a vivid palpable reality, and that the eternal mountains\r\ndo then indeed appear near at hand; while all the campaign around seems\r\nfaded into shadowy distance; and she inclines to say, like the monk, who\r\nfor forty years had exhibited the picture of the Last Supper, that he\r\nhad seen so many pass away, that himself and those he spoke to seemed a\r\nshadow, while the blessed institution of the Holy Supper stood before him\r\nalone a reality. But many are the young hearts that feel as Margaret Hale\r\nfelt, in Mrs. Gaskell’s story, when to her life seemed a vain show, so\r\nunsubstantial, and flickering, and fleeting, and when “it was as if from\r\nsome aërial belfry, high up above the stir and jar of the earth, there\r\nwas a bell continually tolling, ‘All are shadows!—all are passing!—all is\r\npast!’”\r\n\r\n_Le tems même sera detruit_, as La Bruyère says: “ce n’est qu’un point\r\ndans les espaces immenses de l’éternité, et il sera effacé. Il y a de\r\nlégères et frivoles circonstances du tems, qui ne sont pas stables,\r\nqui passent, et que j’appelle des modes, la grandeur, la faveur, les\r\nrichesses, la puissance, l’autorité, l’indépendance, le plaisir, les\r\njoies, la superfluité. Que deviendront ces modes, quand le tems même aura\r\ndisparu? La vertu seule, si peu à la mode, va au-delà des tems.”\r\n\r\n    “Between two worlds life hovers like a star\r\n      ’Twixt night and morn, upon the horizon’s verge:\r\n    How little do we know that which we are!\r\n      How less what we may be! The eternal surge\r\n    Of time and tide rolls on, and bears afar\r\n      Our bubbles; as the old burst, new emerge,\r\n    Lash’d from the foam of ages; while the graves\r\n    Of empire heave but like some passing waves.”\r\n\r\nSo writes Byron in the poem that contains perhaps his grandest and most\r\npowerful strains, interspersed among his wittiest and most wicked ones.\r\nIf ever man was haunted by the conviction that we are shadows all, and\r\nthat shadows are our pursuit, it was he. But with him there was nothing\r\nof a “saving faith” in this. As Shakspeare’s Prince of Arragon reads on\r\nthe scroll at Belmont,\r\n\r\n    “Some there be that shadows kiss;\r\n    Such have but a shadow’s bliss;”\r\n\r\nand of such was Byron. And he knew it. Not more alive to this philosophy\r\nwas Cowper himself, when he pictured men\r\n\r\n    “For threescore years employed with ceaseless care\r\n    In catching smoke and feeding upon air;”\r\n\r\nor when he pointed with this moral his lines on the felled poplars that\r\nonce lent him a shade, beneath which he had so often been charmed by the\r\nblackbird’s sweet flowing ditty:\r\n\r\n    “’Tis a sight to engage me, if anything can,\r\n    To muse on the perishing pleasures of man;\r\n    Though his life be a dream, his enjoyments, I see,\r\n    Have a being less durable even than he.”\r\n\r\nOne great amusement of the household in the Castle of Indolence, on the\r\ntestimony of its poet-laureate, was,\r\n\r\n    “In a huge crystal magic globe to spy,\r\n    Still as you turned it, all things that do pass\r\n    Upon this ant-hill earth; where constantly\r\n    Of idly busy men the restless fry\r\n    Run bustling to and fro with foolish haste,\r\n    In search of pleasures vain that from them fly,\r\n    Or which, obtained, the caitiffs do not taste.”\r\n\r\nIf, with Churchill, we stand as\r\n\r\n    “Spectators only on this bustling stage,\r\n    We see what vain designs mankind engage:\r\n    Vice after vice with ardour they pursue,\r\n    And one old folly brings forth twenty new....\r\n      Squirrels for nuts contend, and, wrong or right,\r\n    For the world’s empire, kings, ambitious, fight.\r\n    What odds?—to us ’tis all the selfsame thing,\r\n    A nut, a world, a squirrel, and a king.”\r\n\r\nIn other verses, and another measure, the same poet justifies his use of\r\nthe expression “whatever shadows we pursue,” by the interpolated comment,\r\n\r\n    “For our pursuits, be what they will,\r\n    Are little more than shadows still;\r\n    Too swift they fly, too swift and strong,\r\n    For man to catch or hold them long.”\r\n\r\nOf world-wide application is what Bernardin de Saint-Pierre said of\r\nhimself, by way of private interpretation: “Toutes mes idées ne sont que\r\ndes ombres de la nature, recueillies par une autre ombre.” Goldsmith was\r\nnot altogether in sport when he made Croaker in the comedy pronounce\r\nlife to be, at the greatest and best, but a froward child, that must be\r\nhumoured and coaxed a little till it falls asleep, and then all the care\r\nis over; while Honeywood assents—Good-natured Man that he is—with a ready\r\n“Very true, sir; nothing can exceed the vanity of our existence, but the\r\nfolly of our pursuits.” For Goldsmith was in sad earnest when he wrote of\r\nhimself as one\r\n\r\n    “Impelled with steps unceasing to pursue\r\n    Some fleeting good that mocks me with the view\r\n    That like the circle bounding earth and skies,\r\n    Allures from far, yet, as I follow, flies.”\r\n\r\nShadow-hunted shadows is the very text for Mr. Carlyle. World’s memory\r\nis very whimsical now and then, he says, in recording the forgotten\r\nexploits of Johann, King of Bohemia, “all which have proved voiceless in\r\nthe World’s memory; while the casual Shadow of a Feather he once more has\r\nproved vocal there.” And a whole chapter is devoted to, and entitled,\r\na Kaiser hunting Shadows,—Kaiser Karl with his Pragmatic Sanction to\r\nwit, and similar projects, aims, or hobbies, more or less shadowy\r\nand unsubstantial, all. “There was another vast Shadow, or confused\r\nhigh-piled continent of shadows, to which our poor Kaiser held with his\r\ncustomary tenacity. To procure adherences and assurances to this dear\r\nPragmatic Sanction, was even more than the shadow of the Spanish crown,”\r\nthe one grand business of his life henceforth. “Shadow of Pragmatic\r\nSanction, shadow of the Spanish crown,—it was such shadow-huntings of the\r\nKaiser in Vienna” that thwarted the Prussian Double-marriage. Another\r\nobject which Kaiser Karl pursued with some diligence, and which “likewise\r\nproved a shadow,” was his Ostend East India Company, which gave much\r\ndisturbance to mankind. “This was the third grand shadow which the Kaiser\r\nchased, shaking all the world, poor crank world, as he strode after it.”\r\nFoiled in this, as in another and another chase, no wonder he grew more\r\nand more saturnine, and “addicted to solid taciturn field-sports. His\r\nPolitical ‘Perforce Hunt (_Parforce Jagd_),’ with so many two-footed\r\nterriers, and legationary beagles, distressing all the world by their\r\nbaying and their burrowing, had proved to be of Shadows; and melted into\r\nthin air, to a very singular degree!” Many chapters later Mr. Carlyle\r\nrecurs to his picture of the “Kaiser in his Shadow-hunt, coursing the\r\nPragmatic Sanction chiefly, as he has done these twenty years past”—and\r\nso begins a chapter entitled, by a mixed metaphor, “Kaiser’s Shadow-hunt\r\nhas caught Fire”—by contact, namely, with inflammable Poland. And a\r\nsubsequent chapter details the damages the poor Kaiser had to pay for\r\nmeddling in Polish elections,—“for galloping thither in chase of\r\nShadows.... This may be considered as the consummation of the Kaiser’s\r\nShadow-hunt; or at least its igniting and exploding point.... Shadow-hunt\r\nis now all gone to Pragmatic Sanction, as it were: that is now the one\r\nthing left in Nature for a Kaiser; and that he will love, and chase,\r\nas the summary of all things.” From this point we see him go steadily\r\ndown, and at a rapid rate,—getting into disastrous Turkish wars, “with\r\nas little preparation for War or Fact as a life-long Hunt of _Shadows_\r\npresupposes.”\r\n\r\nOr let us take our stand, with the same philosopher, in that\r\n_Œil-de-Bœuf_, in the Versailles Palace Gallery—through which what\r\nfigures have passed, and vanished! “Figures? Men? They are fast-fleeting\r\nShadows; fast chasing each other: it is not a Palace, but a Caravansera.”\r\n\r\nMacaulay has his Sermon in a Churchyard. To that spot the homilist\r\ninvites all and sundry, and he takes his standpoint for his text. Come\r\nto this school of his, he bids us, with the promise that there we shall\r\nlearn, “in one short hour of placid thought, a stoicism more deep, more\r\nstern, than ever Zeno’s porch hath taught:”\r\n\r\n    “The plots and feats of those that press\r\n      To seize on titles, wealth, or power,\r\n    Shall seem to thee a game of chess,\r\n      Devised to pass a tedious hour.\r\n    What matters it to him who fights\r\n      For shows of unsubstantial good,\r\n    Whether his kings, and queens, and knights,\r\n      Be things of flesh, or things of wood?\r\n\r\n    “We check and take, exult, and fret;\r\n      Our plans extend, our passions rise,\r\n    Till in our ardour we forget\r\n      How worthless is the victor’s prize.\r\n    Soon fades the spell, soon comes the night:\r\n      Say will it not be then the same,\r\n    Whether we play the black or white,\r\n      Whether we lost or won the game?”\r\n\r\nThis may remind us of Mrs. Battle’s apology for whist, or of the\r\nconcluding sentence in a characteristic confession by Benjamin\r\nConstant—who, by the way, had said of himself in a previous letter, _Je\r\npasserai comme une OMBRE sur la terre entre le malheur et l’ennui_—he\r\nrecords his _sentiment profond et_ (like his name) _constant_ of the\r\nshortness of life—a sentiment, he says, so deep and so constant that\r\nit makes the pen or the book drop from his hand whenever he takes to\r\nstudy: “Nous n’avons pas plus de motifs pour acquérir de la gloire, pour\r\nconquérir un empire ou pour faire un bon livre, que n’en avons pour\r\nfaire une promenade ou une partie de whist.” Even so utterly different\r\na man in creed and character as Joseph de Maistre could exclaim, “Ah!\r\nle vilain monde! j’ai toujours dit qu’il ne pourrait aller si nous\r\navions le sens commun.... C’est nôtre folie qui fait tout aller.” Else\r\nwhen we see—especially when death brings home to us, strikes home to\r\nus—what shadows we are, and what shadows we pursue, “en vérité chacun se\r\ncoucherait et daignerait à peine s’habiller.” _N’importe! tout marche et\r\nc’est assez._ And readers of M. de Tocqueville’s letters will remember\r\nhow often that philosophic writer confides to his correspondents his\r\nconviction that there is no one thing in the world capable of fixing and\r\nsatisfying him. He had attained a success unhoped for at the beginning of\r\nhis career, but was far from happy. Often, in imagination, he would fancy\r\nhimself at the summit of human greatness; and when there, the conviction\r\nwould force itself irrepressibly upon him, that the same painful\r\nsensations would follow him to that sublime altitude.\r\n\r\nSucceeding? What is the great use of succeeding? muses the master\r\nshowman of Vanity Fair. Failing? Where is the great harm? “Psha! These\r\nthings appear as nought, when Time passes—Time the consoler—Time the\r\nanodyne—Time the grey calm satirist, whose sad smile seems to say, Look,\r\nO man, at the vanity of the objects you pursue, and of yourself who\r\npursue them!”\r\n\r\n    “Dust are our frames; and, gilded dust, our pride\r\n    Looks only for a moment whole and sound;\r\n    Like that long-buried body of the king,\r\n    Found lying with his urns and ornaments,\r\n    Which at a touch of light, an air of heaven,\r\n    Slipt into ashes and was found no more.”\r\n\r\nThe professed cynic, remarks an essayist on the theme of Occasional\r\nCynicism, has reached the delightful conclusion that “the whole thing,”\r\nby which he means life and all its interests, is a sheer mistake and\r\npiece of confusion. And as it presents itself to the grander and loftier\r\ntype of mind, this difficulty is held by the same writer to be the\r\n“starting-point of all systems of religion and philosophy, of which it\r\nis the object to show either that aims exist before men’s eyes that are\r\nsolid realities worth pursuing, and not mere shadows, or else that even\r\nshadows are better worth pursuing in some one way than in all others.”\r\n\r\nJeffrey’s earlier letters abound in almost cynical reflections on the\r\nfolly of ambition and the “ridiculous self-importance” implied in “heroic\r\ntoils.” The whole game of life seemed to him a little childish, “and the\r\npuppets that strut and look lofty very nearly as ridiculous as those that\r\nvalue themselves on their airs and graces—poor little bits of rattling\r\ntimber—to be jostled in a bag as soon as the curtain drops.” “God help\r\nus! it is a foolish little thing this human life at the best; and it is\r\nhalf ridiculous and half pitiful to see what importance we ascribe to it,\r\nand to its little ornaments and distinctions,” etc. We are, as a modern\r\npoet of name and promise puts it, for ever at hide-and-seek with our\r\nsouls:\r\n\r\n              ... “Not in Hades alone\r\n    Doth Sisyphus roll, ever frustrate, the stone,\r\n    Do the Danaïds ply, ever vainly, the sieve.\r\n    Tasks as futile does earth to its denizens give.”\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect on the shortness and uncertainty of life, how despicable,\r\nexclaims David Hume, seem all our pursuits of happiness! And even if we\r\nwould extend our concern beyond our own life, he goes on to say, how\r\nfrivolous appear our most enlarged and most generous projects, when we\r\nconsider the incessant changes and revolutions of human affairs, by\r\nwhich laws and learning, books and governments, are hurried away by\r\ntime, as by a rapid stream, and are lost in the immense ocean of matter.\r\nIf such a reflection certainly tends to mortify all our passions, does\r\nit not, asks the essayist, thereby counterwork the artifice of nature,\r\nby which we are “happily deceived into an opinion that human life is\r\nof some importance? And may not such a reflection be employed with\r\nsuccess by voluptuous reasoners, in order to lead us from the paths of\r\naction and virtue into the flowery fields of indolence and pleasure?”\r\nThe Chinese have been pointed to, by a moral philosopher, to point his\r\nmoral, which is, the desolating tendency of secularism—they having learnt\r\npractically, as well as theoretically, to think of themselves as mere\r\ntransitory beings, who have no future life to expect, and no present\r\nProvidence to reverence or fear; and the result he takes to be, that\r\nthey are the meanest, the most deceitful, and one of the most vicious\r\nnations in the world—a people who literally sit in darkness, and whose\r\nlives are passed in the shadow of death. “In all the world there is no\r\nmore terrible or instructive example of the practical results of looking\r\nupon men as mere passing shadows, who have no superior and no hereafter.”\r\nOnce succeed, this writer argues, in persuading men that they are mere\r\npassing phenomena, possessing no more distinctive qualities than the\r\nsuccessive waves of the sea, and the consequence is inevitable. “They\r\nwill cease—gradually, imperceptibly, and with all sorts of moral, and\r\nperhaps religious, reflections on their lips—to care for what is great,\r\npermanent, and noble, and they will become, in the fullest sense of the\r\nwords, beasts that perish.”\r\n\r\nMany men, says Archdeacon Hare, spend their lives in gazing at their\r\nown shadows, and so dwindle away into shadows thereof. And one of his\r\ncompanion guessers at truth remarks, that instead of watching the bird\r\nas it flies above our heads, we chase his shadow along the ground; and,\r\nfinding we cannot grasp it, we conclude it to be nothing.\r\n\r\nIf a man be a reality, says John Sterling, no empty vision in the\r\ndreaming soul of nature, but inwardly substantial and personal, that\r\nwhich he most earnestly desires, which best satisfies his whole being,\r\nmust be real too. And here is a parallel passage from a later writer:\r\n\r\n    “Yes, this life is the war of the False and the True,\r\n    Yet this life is a truth, though so complex to view\r\n    That its latent veracity few of us find....\r\n    Ay, the world but a frivolous phantasm seems,\r\n    And mankind in the mass but as motes in sunbeams;\r\n    But when Fate, from the midst of this frivolous nature,\r\n    Selects for her purpose some frail human creature,\r\n    And the Angel of Sorrow, outstretching a wan\r\n    Forefinger to mark him, strikes down from the man\r\n    The false life that hid him, the man’s self appears\r\n    A solemn reality: Him the dread spheres\r\n    Of heaven and hell with their forces dispute,\r\n    And dare we be indifferent? Hence, and be mute,\r\n    Light scoffer, vain trifler! Through all thou discernest\r\n    A Greater than thou is at work, and in earnest;\r\n    And he who dares trifle with man, trifles too\r\n    With man’s awful Maker.”...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_HARAN TAKEN: TERAH LEFT._\r\n\r\nGENESIS xi. 28.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a pathetic significance in what to the unobserving reader might\r\nseem a dry record of decease, commonplace among other commonplaces,\r\nin the fact mentioned concerning the house of Terah, the father of\r\nAbraham,—that “Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his\r\nnativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.”\r\n\r\nIt is, as Canon Melvill says, like an inversion of the natural order,\r\nwhen we see parents performing the last office to their children: we feel\r\nit natural that children should close the eyes, and shroud the limbs\r\nof fathers and mothers, but unnatural that fathers and mothers should\r\nperform these sad duties for children. “Haran should have followed Terah,\r\nand not Terah Haran.”\r\n\r\nA great French moralist, in his exposition of the sublime intensity of\r\na father’s love, goes on to say of the tie, the _lien_, which unites\r\ndevoted parent to endeared child, “Et la nature brise ce lien. Elle jette\r\nau tombeau cette vie qui commence, et condamne le père à rester vivant.”\r\nA tender poet of our day was writing from such an experience—not in his\r\ncase an isolated one—when bewailing the gem of his hearth, his household\r\npride, who, could love have saved from death, would have found a father’s\r\nlove, and a mother’s, stronger than death:\r\n\r\n    “Humbly we bow to Fate’s decree;\r\n    Yet had we hoped that Time should see\r\n    Thee mourn for us, not us for thee.”\r\n\r\n_Les funérailles des fils_, says another French author, _sont toujours\r\ncontre la nature quand les parents y assistant_. How often Edmund\r\nBurke harps on that tremulously vibrating string, in reference to the\r\nmaster-grief which overshadowed his closing period of life! In a letter\r\nto Dr. Lawrence, he expresses his thankfulness to God for dismissing him\r\n“so gently from life,” and being sent, he adds, “to follow those who in\r\ncourse ought to have followed me.” In his famous letter to the Duke of\r\nBedford, the bereaved old man utters the lament: “I live in an inverted\r\norder. They who ought to have succeeded me have gone before me. They who\r\nshould have been to me as posterity, are in the place of ancestors.”\r\nShakspeare had anticipated the thought, and the expression of the\r\nthought, when he made old Lucretius exclaim:\r\n\r\n    “If in the child the father’s image lies,\r\n    Where shall I live, now Lucrece is unlived?\r\n    Thou wast not to this end from me derived.\r\n    If children predecease progenitors,\r\n    We are their offspring, and they none of ours.”\r\n\r\nSo again he makes Capulet cry out, at the loss of his daughter Juliet, “O\r\nthou untaught! what manners is in this, to press before thy father to a\r\ngrave!” Writing to a kinsman on the birth of a son, Burke gives utterance\r\nto the wish, “May he live to be the staff of your age, and to close your\r\neyes in peace; instead of, like me, reversing the order of nature, and\r\nhaving the melancholy office to close _his_.” And to his “dear little\r\nniece,” Mary, he thus writes after the birth of her son (Thomas Haviland\r\nBurke): “May you see your son a support to your old age; ... and at a\r\nvery long day may _he_ close _your_ eyes, not as I have done those of\r\nyour admirable cousin.” His progeny may never be his posterity, muses Sir\r\nThomas Browne, in his meditations on man: “he may go out of the world\r\nless related than he came into it; and considering the frequent mortality\r\nin friends and relations, in such a term of time, he may pass away divers\r\nyears in sorrow and black habits, and leave none to mourn for himself;\r\norbity may be his inheritance.”\r\n\r\nBitterly Mohammed bewailed the death of his four sons by Kadijah, who\r\ndied in their infancy; and especially that of one by Maria the Egyptian;\r\nfor not only was this fatal to his hopes of founding an hereditary\r\nreligious dynasty, but it affected his claims to pre-eminent favour with\r\nGod. “Al-as Ebn Wayel, who was so cruel and so daring as to insult him on\r\nthe loss of his favourite boy, ... was accursed of heaven, and a special\r\nSura (the 108th) was revealed to console the Prophet.” Bitterly Saint\r\nStephen, the first king of Hungary, bewailed the loss of his promising\r\nson Emeric—the first of a series of shocks that hastened his own end.\r\nLike the desolate sire in Scott’s poem who\r\n\r\n            ... “beheld aghast,\r\n    With Wilfrid all his projects pass,\r\n    All turn’d and centred on his son,\r\n    On Wilfrid all—and he was gone.\r\n    ‘And I am childless now,’ he said.”\r\n\r\nRéné of Anjou, in surviving his male offspring, was the last\r\nrepresentative of his race. Southey observes that _Pauli in domo præter\r\nse nemo superest_, is a reflection passing melancholy in the speech of\r\nPaulus Æmilius; and applying it to his own emphatically good physician,\r\nhe says, that the speedy extinction of his family in his own person was\r\noften in the Doctor’s mind, and that he would sometimes touch upon it, to\r\ndear friends, in moods of autumnal feeling.\r\n\r\nMichelet’s record of the death of Charles le Bel, who leaving only a\r\ndaughter, was succeeded by a cousin, closes with the reminder, “All that\r\nfine family of princes who had sat near their father at the council of\r\nVienne, was extinct. In the popular belief, the curse of Boniface had\r\ntaken effect.” So with Alexander III. of Scotland, whose eldest son died\r\nsoon after his marriage, leaving no issue, and whose second son died\r\nwhile a boy; other bereavements followed, and the king came to feel in\r\nfact as the patriarch felt by anticipation, that to be bereaved of one’s\r\nchildren, was bereavement indeed. King James V., in like manner the\r\nsurvivor of both his sons, died a broken-hearted man.\r\n\r\nLaelio Torelli, the Florentine statesman and man of letters, survived all\r\nhis children. Shakspeare lost his only son some twenty years before his\r\nown decease. Vincentio Scamozzi, the architect, who died the same year as\r\nShakspeare, caused no little talk at the time, by the very singular will\r\nhe left, betokening a most extraordinary solicitude for the perpetuation\r\nof his name, as he had the grief of outliving his offspring. Sir Francis\r\nVere’s three sons and two daughters all died before him. It was accounted\r\na signal calamity in the career of that true nobleman, the Duke of\r\nOrmond, that he outlived “the noble-minded Ossory,” worthy son of such a\r\nsire.\r\n\r\n“The feeble wrap the athletic in his shroud; and weeping fathers build\r\ntheir children’s tomb.” Young’s is that truism; and Pope’s is the cognate\r\nquery, “Say, was it virtue, more though Heaven ne’er gave, lamented\r\nDigby, sunk thee to the grave?\r\n\r\n    “Tell me, if virtue made the son expire,\r\n    Why, full of days and honours, lives the sire?”\r\n\r\nPassing in his Meditations from single persons to families, Marcus\r\nAntoninus refers to that of the Pompeys, for one instance, as wholly\r\nextinct. “This man was the last of his house,” he says, is not an\r\nuncommon inscription upon a monument. As with Homer’s Phænops, in feeble\r\nage, who lost his joy and hope in young Xanthus and Thoön:\r\n\r\n    “Vast was his wealth, and these the only heirs\r\n    Of all his labours, and a life of cares.\r\n    Cold death o’ertakes them in their blooming years,\r\n    And leaves the father unavailing tears.\r\n    To strangers now descends his heapy store,\r\n    The race forgotten, and the name no more.”\r\n\r\nWho on his staff is this? we ask with Ossian; who is this whose head is\r\nwhite with age, whose eyes are red with tears, who quakes at every step?\r\n“It is thy father, O Morar!” dead and gone Morar: “the father of no\r\nson but thee.... Weep, thou father of Morar; weep, but thy son heareth\r\nthee not. Deep is the sleep of the dead—low their pillow of dust.” This\r\nflies sure to the old man’s heart, says Schiller’s Illo of the elder\r\nPiccolomini,\r\n\r\n          ... “He has his whole life long\r\n    Fretted and toil’d to raise his ancient house\r\n    From a count’s title to the name of prince;\r\n    And now must seek a grave for his only son.”\r\n\r\nPeter the Great, whether guilty or not of putting to death his elder son,\r\nAlexis, was inconsolable for the loss of the only remaining one. It was\r\nthe fate of Queen Anne to lose, at twelve years of age, the hopeful young\r\nprince who alone survived of all her very many children.\r\n\r\nSamuel Richardson was the saddened survivor of all his five sons\r\nand a daughter. The celebrated Dutch philosopher and mathematician,\r\n’Sgravesande, who, by the way, was born within the same year with\r\nRichardson, lost his two sons within eight days of each other, and is\r\nhonoured for the Christian resignation with which he bore the sharp\r\ntrial. Sir John Vanbrugh lost his only son at the battle of Tournay.\r\nBishop Warburton died not long after his only son, who was carried off\r\nby a decline in the springtide of life. It is of a distinguished Swiss\r\nlittérateur, who died in his prime, that Sainte-Beuve somewhere says _que\r\nsa destinée tranchée avant l’heure a pourtant été complète, si un père\r\noctogénaire ne lui survivait_.\r\n\r\n    “I ought to have gone before him: I wonder he went so young,”\r\n\r\nwails the aged mother in Mr. Tennyson’s poem, all whose children have\r\ngone before her, she is so old.\r\n\r\nThe gathering sorrows which clouded the latter years of Bishop Percy,\r\n“after a life in the main prosperous and happy,” commenced with the loss\r\nof an only son.\r\n\r\nLord Kenyon died in 1802, “sorrow-stricken by the loss of his eldest son,\r\nafter having accumulated a fortune of £300,000.” Lord Stowell lost his\r\nson, aged forty-two, about two months only before he too fell on death.\r\nSprengel, the very learned German physician, never recovered the stroke\r\nof his son’s loss. Cuvier’s four children all died before him. “Write ye\r\nthis man childless:” many a man of genius has felt his heart sink and his\r\nstrength fail under that blighting sentence. In his sixty-seventh year\r\nwe find Moore writing, “The last of our five children is now gone, and\r\nwe are left desolate and alone. Not a single relative have I now left in\r\nthe world.” How Mr. Hallam was successively bereaved of sons so rich in\r\npromise, if not in performance, is too well known.\r\n\r\nThere is a seeming affectation of literary paternity in what\r\nChateaubriand writes of the death of Byron,—as though it were Terah and\r\nHaran, with a difference. “I preceded him in life; he preceded me in\r\ndeath. He was summoned before his time. My number came before his, and\r\nyet his was drawn first from the urn. It was Childe Harold who ought to\r\nhave remained.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE MOTE AND THE BEAM._\r\n\r\nST. MATTHEW vii. 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs easy is it to discern the mote in a brother’s eye as to discern the\r\nface of the sky. Hypocrite is the term by which the facile discerner in\r\neither case is divinely stigmatised; in the one instance, because with\r\nall his discernment he cannot read the signs of the times; in the other,\r\nbecause with all his insight and microscopic nicety of perception, and\r\nexceptionally developed faculty of vision, he yet considers not the beam\r\nthat is in his own eye.\r\n\r\nWith our Lord’s words concerning the mote and the beam, Archbishop\r\nTrench bids us compare the Chinese proverb, “Sweep away the snow from\r\nthine own door, and heed not the frost upon thy neighbour’s tiles.” The\r\nGreek and Latin classics are not wanting in various readings of the same\r\ntheme. Demosthenes meant much the same thing when he said that we must\r\nbeware of austerely scrutinizing the actions of others, unless first we\r\nare conscious of having acquitted ourselves aright: “οὐ γὰρ ἐστι πικρῶς\r\nἐξετάσαι τι πέπρακται τοῖς ἀλλοῖς, ἀν μὴ παῤ ὑμῶν ἀυτῶν πρῶτον ὑπάρξη τὰ\r\nδέοντα.” “Man is blind to his own faults, but keen-sighted to perceive\r\nthose of others,” is a Latin adage: “Vitiis suis pervidendis cæcus est\r\nhomo, in alienis perspicax.” “Is it never your way to look at yourself\r\nwhen you are abusing another?” is a question in Plautus: “Non soles\r\nrespicere te, cum dicas injuste alteri?” Cicero pronounces it to be of\r\nthe nature of folly to see the faults of others, and to forget one’s own:\r\n“Proprium est stultitiæ aliorum vitia cernere, oblivisci suorum.” Horace\r\nshrewdly submits that the man who is desirous that his friends should not\r\ntake offence at his own protuberances, will “ignore” that friend’s warts:\r\n\r\n    “Qui, ne tuberibus propriis offendat amicum,\r\n    Postulat, ignoscat verrucis illius.”\r\n\r\nAnd at least as pointed and piquant is the passage beginning,\r\n\r\n    “Quum tua pervideas oculis male lippus inunctis,\r\n    Cur in amicorum vitiis tam cernis acutum,” etc.\r\n\r\nThe query Plautus puts, “How is it that no man tries to search into\r\nhimself, but each fixes his eyes on the wallet of the one who goes before\r\nhim?” is in allusion to the fable of Jupiter having loaded men with a\r\ncouple of wallets; the one, filled with our own vices, being slung at our\r\nbacks,\r\n\r\n    “Propriis repletam vitiis post tergum dedit;”\r\n\r\nthe other, heavy with our neighbour’s faults, hung in front,\r\n\r\n    “Alienis ante pectus suspendit gravem.”\r\n\r\nTo pardon those absurdities in ourselves which we cannot suffer in\r\nothers, is neither better nor worse, says Dean Swift, than to be more\r\nwilling to be fools ourselves than to have others so. The proverbs\r\nof all nations show all nations to be alive to the ridiculous in this\r\nrespect. The kiln calls the oven, burnt house, says one. In Italy,\r\nthe pan says to the pot, Keep off, or you’ll smutch me. In Spain, the\r\nraven bawls hoarsely to the crow, Get out, blackamoor! (_Quítate allá,\r\nnegro!_) In Germany, one ass nicknames another, Long-ears. And Dr. Trench\r\nis rather taken with a certain originality in the Catalan version of\r\nthe proverb: “Death said to the man with his throat cut, ‘How ugly you\r\nlook!’” They should be fair, hints Juvenal, who venture to deride the\r\ndisproportioned leg or sooty hide, _Loripedem rectus derideat, Æthiopem\r\nalbus_. Yet, as the Ettrick shepherd once sang in his native Doric:—\r\n\r\n    “There’s some wi’ big scars on their face,\r\n      Point out a prin scart on a frien’;\r\n    And some, black as sweeps wi’ disgrace,\r\n      Cry out, the whole warld’s unclean.”\r\n\r\nMolière’s Chrysale twits her sister Bélise, who is a _femme savante_,\r\nwith snapping up everybody short who makes a slip with the tongue, while\r\nherself liable to graver censure for slips of conduct:—\r\n\r\n    “Le moindre solécisme en parlant vous irrite;\r\n    Mais vous en faites, vous, d’étranges en conduite.”\r\n\r\nSappho, again, in Mademoiselle de Scudéry’s portentous romance—once\r\nthe rage of readers in France, despite its plurality of volumes, as\r\n“Clarissa” was in England, a century later—ridicules the _bizarre_\r\northography of the fine-ladyism of the day, while amused at the fact\r\nthat the fine ladies in question, who perpetrated such gross errors in\r\nwriting, and who lost every particle of wit the moment they took up a\r\npen, would yet make game for days together of some poor foreigner who\r\nhappened to use one term for another. As if it were less a matter of\r\nmirth or marvel for a _grande dame_, claiming to be a woman of wit, too,\r\nand a power in society, to commit a thousand blunders in writing her\r\nnative language, than for a raw foreigner to make a few slips in speaking\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWe every day and every hour, observes Montaigne, say things of another\r\nthat we might more properly say of ourselves, could we but revert our\r\nobservation to our own concerns as well as extend it to others. And the\r\nold essayist has his fling at not a few authors of the day who, in this\r\nmanner, prejudiced their own cause by running headlong upon those they\r\nattacked, and darting those shafts against their enemies that might, with\r\nmuch greater propriety and effect, be hurled back at themselves.\r\n\r\nA stanza in the most elaborate of Shakspeare’s poems that are not\r\nplays—for are not all his plays poems?—runs into this eloquence of\r\nremonstrant appeal:—\r\n\r\n    “Think but how vile a spectacle it were\r\n      To view thy present trespass in another.\r\n    Men’s faults do seldom to themselves appear;\r\n      Their own transgressions partially they smother:\r\n      This guilt would seem death-worthy in thy brother.\r\n      O, how are they wrapped in with infamies,\r\n      That from their own misdeeds askance their eyes!”\r\n\r\nIt is of their common friend Breuning that Beethoven writes to Ferdinand\r\nRies,—“He certainly possesses many admirable qualities, but he thinks\r\nhimself quite faultless, whereas the very defects that he discovers in\r\nothers are those which he possesses himself to the highest degree.” One\r\nof the most natural and truthfully, as well as forcibly, drawn characters\r\nin Mrs. Inchbald’s “Simple Story,”—Sandford,—a man of understanding, of\r\nlearning, and a complete casuist, yet all whose faults were committed for\r\nthe want of knowing better, is described as constantly reproving faults\r\nin others, and most assuredly too good a man not to have corrected and\r\namended his own, had they been known to him; but known to him they were\r\nnot. He had been, we are told, for so long a time the spiritual superior\r\nor preceptor of all with whom he lived, and so busied with instructing\r\nothers, that he had not once recollected that he needed instruction\r\nhimself; and in such awe did his habitual severity keep all about him,\r\nthat although he had numerous friends, not one of them told him of his\r\nfailing. “Was there not then some reason for him to suppose he _had_ no\r\nfaults? His enemies, indeed, hinted that he had; but enemies he never\r\nhearkened to; and thus, with all his good sense, he wanted the sense to\r\nfollow the rule, ‘Believe what your enemies say of you rather than what\r\nis said by your friends.’” He had yet to learn, and to learn by heart,\r\nthe wide and practical import of the prayer—\r\n\r\n    “Teach me to love and to forgive,\r\n    Exact my own defects to scan,\r\n    What others are to feel, and know myself a Man.”\r\n\r\nWell may the demoniac guide of Don Cleofas, in Le Sage’s symbolical\r\nfiction, say, and well does he say, “J’admire messieurs les hommes; leurs\r\npropres défauts leur paraissent des minuties, au lieu qu’ils regardent\r\nceux d’autrui avec un microscope.” To their own faults more than a little\r\nblind, to those of others they are not a little unkind.\r\n\r\nGay begins his fable of the Turkey and the Ant with the smoothly-turned\r\ntruism, that\r\n\r\n    “In other men we faults can spy,\r\n    And blame the mote that dims their eye;\r\n    Each little speck and error find;\r\n    To our own stronger errors blind.”\r\n\r\nOne of the most classical masters of modern English, whether in verse\r\nor prose, was employing the same metre—of fatal facility, as it is\r\ncalled—when he closed his address to a brother bard in a strain that must\r\nalso close this chapter of instances:\r\n\r\n    “We, who surround a common table,\r\n    And imitate the fashionable,\r\n    Wear each two eye-glasses: _this_ lens\r\n    Shows us our faults, _that_ other men’s.\r\n    We do not care how dim may be\r\n    _This_ by whose aid our own we see;\r\n    But, ever anxiously alert\r\n    That all may have their whole desert,\r\n    We would melt down the stars and sun\r\n    In our heart’s furnace, to make one\r\n    Through which th’ enlightened world might spy\r\n    A mote upon a brother’s eye.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_STRANGERS AND PILGRIMS._\r\n\r\n1 PETER ii. 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout\r\nAsia Minor, addressed the urgent appeal that _as_ strangers—strangers and\r\npilgrims—they should abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nConsider what you are, he seems to say, as his words are paraphrased\r\nby the greatest of all commentators on his first epistle: “If you were\r\ncitizens of this world, then you might drive the same trade” with the\r\nmen of this world, “and follow the same lusts; but seeing you are chosen\r\nand called out of this world, and invested into a new society, made free\r\nof another city, and are therefore here but travellers passing through\r\nto your own country, it is very reasonable that there be this difference\r\nbetwixt you and the world, that while they live at home your carriage be\r\nsuch as fits strangers, not glutting yourselves with their pleasures,\r\nnor surfeiting upon their delicious fruits, as some unwary travellers\r\ndo abroad; but as wise strangers living warily and soberly, and still\r\nminding most of all your journey homewards, suspecting dangers and snares\r\nin your way, and so walking with a holy fear, as the Hebrew word for a\r\nstranger imports.”\r\n\r\nThe topic is one upon which Archbishop Leighton ever writes feelingly.\r\nAs again in his comment on the psalmist’s profession of being a stranger\r\nwith God, and a sojourner as all his fathers were, the same devout\r\nexpositor observes that he who looks on himself as a stranger, and is\r\nsensible of the darkness round about him in this wilderness, will often\r\nput up that request with David, “I am a stranger in the earth: hide not\r\nThy commandments from me.” What, Leighton asks, is the joy of our life,\r\nbut the thoughts of that other life, our home before us? “And certainly\r\nhe that lives much in these thoughts, set him where you will here, he is\r\nnot much pleased nor displeased; but if His Father call him home, that\r\nword gives him his heart’s desire.”\r\n\r\nOnce again, in the sixth of his lectures on the immortality of the soul,\r\nLeighton expatiates on the fact that this is not our rest, that we have\r\nno place of residence here below: “it is the region of fleas and gnats;\r\nand while we search for happiness among these mean and perishing things,\r\nwe are not only sure to be disappointed, but also not to escape those\r\nmiseries which, in great numbers, continually beset us; so that we may\r\napply to ourselves the saying of the famous artist confined in the island\r\nof Crete, and truly say,—\r\n\r\n    “‘Nec tellus nostræ, nec patet unda fugæ,\r\n    Restat iter cœli, cœlo tentabimus ire.’”\r\n\r\n(“The earth and the sea are shut up against us, and neither of them can\r\nfavour our escape; the way to heaven is alone open, and this way we will\r\nstrive to go.”)\r\n\r\nIncidentally, it adds to the interest of every such passage in Leighton’s\r\nwritings to remember a noteworthy circumstance respecting his death.\r\nHe had been used to say that if he were to choose a place to die in it\r\nshould be an inn—for that would look so like a pilgrim’s going home, to\r\nwhom this world was all as an inn. It was his opinion, also, as we read\r\nin the memoir of him by Aikman, that “the officious tenderness and care\r\nof friends was an entanglement to a dying man, and that the unconcerned\r\nattendance of those who could be procured in such a place would give less\r\ndisturbance.” He had his wish. At the Bell Inn, Warwick Lane, Robert\r\nLeighton, in his seventy-fourth year, stranger and pilgrim, drew his last\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n    “An inn receives me, where, unknown,\r\n    I solitary sit me down;\r\n    Many I hear, and some I see—\r\n    I nought to them, they nought to me.\r\n\r\n    Thus, in those regions of the dead,\r\n    A pilgrim’s wandering life I lead;\r\n    And still at every step declare\r\n    I’ve no abiding city here.\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    The world is like an inn; for there\r\n    Men call and storm and drink and swear;\r\n    While undisturbed the Christian waits,\r\n    And reads and writes and meditates.\r\n\r\n    Though in the dark ofttimes I stray,\r\n    The Lord shall light me on my way;\r\n    And to the city of the sun\r\n    Conduct me, when my journey’s done.\r\n\r\n    There by these eyes shall He be seen,\r\n    Who sojourned for me at an inn;\r\n    On Sion’s hill I those shall hail\r\n    From whom I parted in the vale.”\r\n\r\nOf him who walks by faith and not by sight, who places eternity by the\r\nside of time, and so regards the one as a mere path or stepping-stone to\r\nthe other, it is well said by Dr. Chalmers that he actually moves through\r\nlife in the spirit of a traveller, feels his home to be heaven, and all\r\nhis dearest hopes and interests to be laid up there; “walking therefore\r\nover the world with a more light and unencumbered step than other men,\r\njust because all its adversities to him are but the crosses of a rapid\r\njourney, and all its joys but the shifting scenery of the land through\r\nwhich he is travelling, and visions of passing loveliness.”\r\n\r\nAs in the pilgrim’s song of a contemporary clerical poet:\r\n\r\n    “My rest is in heaven; my rest is not here:\r\n    Then why should I murmur when trials are near?\r\n    Be hushed, my dark spirit! the worst that can come\r\n    But shortens thy journey, and hastens thee home.\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    A scrip on my back, and a staff in my hand,\r\n    I march on in haste through an enemy’s land:\r\n    The road may be rough, but it cannot be long;\r\n    And I’ll smooth it with hope, and I’ll cheer it with song.”\r\n\r\nThe second of Bishop Beveridge’s Resolutions comprises this\r\nutterance,—after the expression of a longing that he could be ever on\r\nthe mount, taking a view of the land of Canaan, for then what dreams and\r\nshadows would all things here below appear to be,—“Well! by the grace of\r\nGod, I am resolved no longer to tie myself to sense and sight, the sordid\r\nand trifling affairs of this life, but always to walk as one of the other\r\nworld; to behave myself in all places, and at all times, as one already\r\npossessed of my inheritance and an inhabitant of the New Jerusalem;—by\r\nfaith assuring myself I have but a few more days to live below, a little\r\nmore work to do, and be admitted to a nearer vision and fruition of God,\r\nand see Him face to face.” And thus, although at present here in the\r\nflesh, the believer’s resolve is to look upon himself as more really an\r\ninhabitant of heaven than abiding (for here we have no continuing city)\r\nupon earth.\r\n\r\nIn the words of _l’exilé_ of Lamennais, “La patrie n’est point ici-bas;\r\nl’homme vainement l’y cherche; ce qu’il prend pour elle n’est qu’un gite\r\nd’une nuit.” Happy they, exclaims Pascal in his _Pensées_, whose tears\r\nare shed, not at the evanescence of all things earthly and perishable,\r\nbut when they remember Sion—_dans le souvenir de leur chère patrie_—the\r\nheavenly Jerusalem, after which they sigh continually in the weariness of\r\ntheir exile. But as Schiller’s Thekla replies to Neubrunn’s comment on\r\n“the journey’s weary length,”—\r\n\r\n    “The pilgrim, travelling to a distant shrine\r\n    Of hope and healing, does not count the leagues.”\r\n\r\nJohn Foster describes the Israelite indeed, who is a pilgrim indeed, as\r\nresembling a person whose eye, while he is conversing with you about an\r\nobject or a succession of objects, should glance every moment towards\r\nsome great obstacle appearing on the distant horizon. “He seems to\r\ntalk to his friends in somewhat of the manner of expression with which\r\nyou can imagine that Elijah spoke, if he remarked to his companion any\r\ncircumstance in the journey from Bethel to Jericho, and from Jericho\r\nto the Jordan; a manner betraying the sublime anticipation which was\r\npressing on his thoughts.” To other pilgrims the vision of the land that\r\nis very far off may be, as Professor Maurice puts it, not so clear as\r\nthey wish; but it is more clear than their vision of anything which lies\r\nabout them; and without it all would be shadow and darkness. “There, in\r\nthat state, must lie all that they dream of and hope for.” “There only\r\nthey must live, or have no life.” “When they pray ‘Thy kingdom come,’\r\nthey ask that the Great Shepherd will lead them and their brethren out of\r\na land of pits, a thirsty wilderness, a valley of the shadow of death,\r\nto a peaceable habitation and a sure dwelling-place.” There is a bleak\r\ndesert, in the words of one who wrote sacred songs, though himself no\r\nsacred poet,—\r\n\r\n            ... “where daylight grows weary\r\n    Of wasting its smiles on a desert so dreary—\r\n                What may that desert be?\r\n    ’Tis life, cheerless life, where the few joys that come\r\n    Are lost like that daylight, for ’tis not their home.\r\n\r\n    There is a lone pilgrim, before whose faint eyes\r\n    The water he pants for but sparkles and flies—\r\n                Who may that pilgrim be?\r\n    ’Tis man, hapless man, through this life tempted on\r\n    By fair shining hopes, that in shining are gone.”\r\n\r\nIn that essay of John Foster’s, from which a citation has already been\r\nmade, the essayist protests against the care so many popular writers\r\nseem to take to guard against the inroad of ideas pertaining to another\r\nlife—as much care as the inhabitants of Holland take against the\r\nirruption of the sea; and their writings, he adds, do really form a kind\r\nof moral dyke against the invasion from the other world. “They do not\r\ninstruct a man to act, to enjoy, and to suffer, as a being that may by\r\nto-morrow have finally abandoned this orb; everything is done to beguile\r\nthe feeling of his being ‘a stranger and a pilgrim on the earth.’” They\r\nfail to recognise the _c’est vrai_ of the Christian lyrist’s avowal, the—\r\n\r\n    “_’Tis true_, we are but strangers\r\n      And sojourners below;\r\n    And countless snares and dangers\r\n      Surround the path we go:\r\n\r\n    Though painful and distressing,\r\n      Yet there’s a rest above;\r\n    And onward still we’re pressing,\r\n      To reach that land of love.”\r\n\r\nThe object of such a pilgrim is progress—or, rather, progress is the\r\nmeans to an end; and the end is not yet, is not here, but will surely\r\ncome, and come quickly, and will not tarry. There is a wicket gate\r\ntowards which they are making progress, and it is the portal of a\r\ncity that hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God. They who\r\nprofessedly sojourn here as in a strange country, who obey the call to go\r\nout into a place which they shall after receive for an inheritance; who\r\nconfess, and act on the confession, that they are strangers and pilgrims\r\non the earth; they that say and do such things declare plainly that they\r\nseek a country, a better country—that is, a heavenly.\r\n\r\nChaucer’s “old style” conveys a meaning the world can never be too old to\r\nlearn:\r\n\r\n    “Here is no home, here is but wyldyrnesse.\r\n    Forth, pilgrime! forth, best out of thy stalle!\r\n    Look up on hye, and thonke God of alle;\r\n    Weyve thy lust, and let thy goste thee lede,[18]\r\n    And trouthe shall thee delyver, it is no drede.”\r\n\r\nWe are strangers and sojourners before God, as were all our fathers.\r\nBy faith it was that Abraham sojourned in the land of promise, as in a\r\nstrange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs\r\nwith him of the same promise; in tabernacles, that bespeak the stranger\r\nand pilgrim upon earth; not in houses built to endure. For he confessed,\r\nand denied not, but confessed that here he had no continuing city. True,\r\na citizen he was of no mean city. But it was not of the earth, earthy.\r\nFor he looked for a city which hath foundations, more everlasting than\r\nthe hills. Meanwhile, God’s statutes were his songs in the house of his\r\npilgrimage.\r\n\r\nThe Bird of God is Wordsworth’s epithet for that “resplendent wanderer”\r\ncalled by Eastern islanders the Bird of Heaven, and by us of the West,\r\nBird of Paradise; and, as usual with the serenely meditative bard of\r\nRydal, there is moral, nay, religious teaching in the symbolism of his\r\nstrain:—\r\n\r\n    “The Bird of God! whose blessed will\r\n    She seems performing as she flies\r\n    Over the earth and through the skies,\r\n    In never-wearied search of Paradise—\r\n    Region that crowns her beauty with the name\r\n    She bears for us—for us how blest,\r\n    How happy at all seasons, could like aim\r\n    Uphold our spirits urged to kindred flight\r\n    On wings that fear no glance of God’s pure sight,\r\n    No tempest from His breath, their promised rest\r\n    Seeking with indefatigable quest\r\n    Above a world that deems itself most wise\r\n    When most enslaved by gross realities!”\r\n\r\nAn appalling pestilence raged in Carthage, and so gave deadly emphasis to\r\nthe exhortations of St. Cyprian, when he, a good shepherd, sought to lead\r\nthe sheep of his flock to green pastures and still waters of comfort;\r\nreminding them, as he stood between the living and the dead, while as yet\r\nthe plague was stayed not, that they had renounced the world, and were\r\nabiding here as strangers and pilgrims only. “Let us,” he besought them,\r\n“embrace that time which gives to each one his home, which, delivering\r\nus from this world, and loosing us from worldly snares, restores us to\r\nparadise and the kingdom.” Who, he asks, that is placed in a foreign\r\nland, would not hasten to return to his own country? Who that saileth\r\ntowards his own, would not eagerly desire a prosperous wind to bring him\r\nswiftly to the embrace of those he loves? “Our country we believe to be\r\nparadise: the patriarchs we esteem our parents. Why, then, do we not\r\nspeed and run, that we may behold our country and salute our parents?”\r\n\r\nSalutary though the sentiment be, however, it admits of one-sided\r\nexaggeration. There are good people who, for instance, exalt and\r\nexpatiate upon the death of godly infants, as though to quit this earth\r\nof ours at the very earliest date were the most blessed of privileges.\r\nThe idea of man being sent into the world for any definite purpose\r\nnever seems, it has been justly said, to enter the minds of these good\r\npeople. “With them life is but an irksome omnibus-journey—the shorter\r\nthe better—and to be got over by each without any regard to the comfort\r\nor requirements of his fellow-travellers.” Only in part are these\r\nstrictures on “the shorter the better” applicable, if at all, to the\r\ntheme and expression of Mrs. Browning’s sonnet:—\r\n\r\n    “I think we are too ready with complaint\r\n      In this fair world of God’s. Had we no hope\r\n      Indeed beyond the zenith and the slope\r\n    Of yon grey blank of sky, we might grow faint\r\n    To muse upon eternity’s constraint\r\n      Round our aspirant souls. But since the scope\r\n      Must widen early, is it well to droop\r\n    For a few days consumed in loss and taint?\r\n    O pusillanimous heart! be comforted,\r\n      And, like a cheerful traveller, take the road,\r\n    Singing beside the hedge. What if the bread\r\n      Be bitter in thine inn, and thou unshod\r\n    To meet the flints?—At least it may be said,\r\n      ‘Because the way is _short_, I thank thee, God!’”\r\n\r\nAddison devotes a paragraph in one of his _Spectators_ to the fact of\r\nmen being in Scripture called strangers and sojourners upon earth, and\r\nlife a pilgrimage. And he refers to several heathen as well as Christian\r\nauthors, who under the same kind of metaphor have represented the world\r\nas an inn, which was only designed to furnish us with accommodation in\r\nthis our passage. It is therefore very absurd, urges our moral essayist,\r\nto think of setting up our rest before we come to our journey’s end; and\r\nnot rather to take care of the reception we shall there meet with, than\r\nto fix our thoughts on the little conveniences and advantages which we\r\nenjoy one above another in the way to it.\r\n\r\n“The Illusiveness of Life” is the title of a sermon on the patriarchs\r\nas sojourners in a strange country, by the late F. W. Robertson, of\r\nBrighton; who with characteristic force and insight explains the\r\ndeception of life’s promise, and the meaning of that deception. He shows\r\nhow our natural anticipations deceive us—every human life being a fresh\r\none, bright with hopes that will never be realized. With our affections,\r\nhe goes on to say, it is still worse, because they promise more. “Men’s\r\naffections are but the tabernacles of Canaan—the tents of a night—not\r\npermanent habitations, even for this life.” Where, he asks, are the\r\ncharms of character, the perfection and the purity and the truthfulness\r\nwhich seemed so resplendent in our friend? They were only the shape of\r\nour own conceptions—our creative shaping intellect projected its own\r\nfantasies on him; and hence we outgrow our early friendships—outgrow\r\nthe intensity of all: we dwell in tents; we never find a home, even in\r\nthe land of promise, any more than Abraham did. “Life is an unenjoyable\r\nCanaan, with nothing real or substantial in it.” But there is another\r\nbeside the sentimental way, trite enough, of considering this aspect of\r\nlife—as a bubble, a dream, a delusion, a phantasm, and that other is the\r\nway of faith. “The ancient saints felt as keenly as any moralist could\r\nfeel the brokenness of life’s promises: they confessed that they were\r\nstrangers and pilgrims here; they said that they had here no continuing\r\ncity; but they did not mournfully moralize on this; they said it\r\ncheerfully, and rejoiced that it was so.” Strangers—the very term implies\r\na distant home. Pilgrims—the law of whose pilgrimage is to make progress.\r\nForgetting the things behind; rating at their true worth the things\r\naround; earnestly pressing forward to the things before. Keble’s devout\r\nlyric on the escape to Zoar is pitched in this key:—\r\n\r\n    “Sweet is the smile of home; the mutual look\r\n      When hearts are of each other sure;\r\n    Sweet all the joys that crowd the household nook,\r\n      The haunt of all affections pure;\r\n    Yet in the world even these abide, and we\r\n      Above the world our calling boast:\r\n    Once gain the mountain-top, and thou art free:\r\n      Till then, who rest, presume; who turn to look, are lost.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE FALSITY OF THE FAMILIAR FRIEND._\r\n\r\nPSALM xli. 9.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe psalmist’s enemies were speaking evil of him: when should he die,\r\nand his name perish? All that hated him were whispering together against\r\nhim, and devising hurt. But this he could bear, on the part of declared\r\nfoes. What he could not bear was that his own familiar friend, in whom he\r\ntrusted, and who ate of his bread, should have lifted up his heel against\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHengstenberg remarks that in Judas the expression, “Which did eat of my\r\nbread,” receives its full, its frightful verification, in the fact of his\r\nparticipating in the Last Supper—to say nothing of habitually sharing in\r\nprevious and everyday meals.\r\n\r\nEven a comparatively slight wound may be severe when dealt by a friend.\r\nDr. Colani thinks that never could the Son of man have felt so acutely\r\nthe pain caused by opposition and non-recognition as when He received\r\nthe message from John the Baptist, inquiring into the credentials of His\r\nDivine mission. That the rulers of the people, that one of the twelve,\r\nthat those of His own kin, should doubt or dispute His mission, was hard\r\nenough to bear, but perhaps easy to foresee. But when he who had baptized\r\nHim, who had, so to speak, revealed Him to Himself,—when His “spiritual\r\nfather” took his stand among the doubters, “Jesus must have felt a\r\nheartrending surprise, a veritable consternation:” for the Baptist was\r\nnot a reed shaken with the wind, and yet, if the Divine hand rested on\r\nthat support, what but a reed was it, to pierce, even while it gave way?\r\n\r\nThe _Et tu, Brute!_ of dying Cæsar is a large utterance, hardly more\r\ndeep in reproachful pathos than wide of application. The bitterness of\r\nits import, varying in intensity, has sufficed to choke bad men and good\r\nand indifferent,—as a pang more sharp than all. What stung Jugurtha to\r\nthe heart was the treachery of his confidential agent, Bomilcar, who\r\nintrigued to betray him to the Romans. What Cicero professes to have felt\r\nmost keenly, during the Clodian troubles, was the perfidious conduct to\r\nhim of that Serranus to whom, when consul, he had been so kind; nor was\r\nit the least bitter drop in the cup he had to drain at the last, that the\r\nleader of the band who took his life was one whose life Cicero had once\r\nsaved, as counsel for the defence. Antony in the tragedy is naturally\r\nmade to brood most resentfully on the being betrayed by one on whose\r\nbosom he had “slept secure of injured faith.” He can forgive a foe, but\r\nnot a friend:\r\n\r\n    “Treason is there in its most horrid shape,\r\n    Where trust is greatest.”\r\n\r\nHerod the Great felt the pang when that dark and horrible secret, as\r\nMilman calls it, came to light, that Antipater, the beloved son, for whom\r\nhe had imbrued his hands in the blood of his own children—Antipater, the\r\nheir of his kingdom—was “clearly proved to have conspired with Pheroras\r\n(B.C. 5) to poison his old and doting father, and thus to secure and\r\naccelerate his own succession.” Michelet’s narrative of the decline and\r\ndeath of the Emperor Frederick II. comprises this record: “Finally his\r\nchancellor, his dearest friend, Peter de Vineâ, attempted to poison him.\r\nAfter this last blow it only remained for him to veil his face, like\r\nCæsar on the ides of March.” And familiar to us all is the story of our\r\nHenry II., sick and bedridden, inquiring the names of the supporters\r\nof his rebellious son Richard. He was for declaring John, the youngest\r\nof his sons, and as he thought the most attached to him, heir to all\r\nhis continental dominions. But on hearing the name of his beloved John,\r\nhighest on the list of Richard’s adherents, Henry was seized with a sort\r\nof convulsive agitation, sat up in bed, and gazing around with searching\r\nand haggard look, exclaimed, “Can it be true that John, my heart, the\r\nson of my choice, on whom I doted more than on all the rest, and my love\r\nfor whom has brought on me all my woes, has fallen from me?” Assured\r\nthat so it was, “Well then,” sighed Henry, falling back on his bed, and\r\nturning his face to the wall, “henceforward let all go on as it may; I\r\nno longer care for myself nor for the world.” And in this connection may\r\nbe mentioned the dying exclamation of Henry’s murdered chancellor. “What\r\nis this, Reginald?” cried Becket to Fitzurse, when the latter made up to\r\nhim, bared sword in hand: “I have loaded you with favours, and _you_ come\r\nto me armed, and in the church?” The last stroke that broke down the aged\r\nPope Boniface VIII., bowed with the weight of eighty-six years, was the\r\ndefection of his favourite and favoured nephew. One may apply to such\r\ndefections the upbraidal in a latter-day poem on Old Pictures in Florence:\r\n\r\n    “Giotto, how, with that soul of yours,\r\n      Could you play me false who loved you so?\r\n    Some slight if a certain heart endures,\r\n      It feels, I would have your fellows know.\r\n    Well—I perceive not why I should care\r\n      To break a silence that suits them best;\r\n    But the thing grows somewhat hard to bear\r\n      When I find a Giotto join the rest.”\r\n\r\nMost painful to Luther, in his last moments, was the controversy forced\r\nupon him by the defection of so dear a friend as Agricola, the leader of\r\nthe Antinomians. He had long before that expressed his “astoundment” at\r\nthe secession of Œcolampadius and Regius, and other intimate associates.\r\n“Why should I fret and fume against the papists?” he wrote in 1531: “all\r\nthey have done against me has been in fair, open war; we are declared\r\nenemies, and act as such. They who hurt me are my own dear children. My\r\nbrothers, _fraterculi mei, aurei amiculi mei_.... I thought I had gone\r\nthrough, had exhausted all the adversities the evil one could inflict;\r\nbut it was not so. My Absalom, the child of my heart, had not deserted\r\nhis father, had not poured out ignominy upon David; my Judas, the traitor\r\nwho delivered up his master, had not sold me: he has done so now.”\r\n\r\nIf Mary Stuart had any quarter to which, in her disastrous condition,\r\nshe might look for love and favour, it was, says the most popular of\r\nhistorians of Scotland, her brother Murray. _His_ kindness and compassion\r\nshe deserved, after loading him with favours, as well as pardoning him\r\nconsiderable offences. But his acceptance of the regency broke all\r\nremaining ties of tenderness betwixt him and his sister. Scott is not\r\nromancing when, in an historical romance, he describes her reception\r\nof the news. “The queen gave a sort of shriek, and clapping her hands\r\ntogether, exclaimed, ‘Comes the arrow out of his quiver?—out of my\r\nbrother’s bow?’” When Elizabeth appointed commissioners to inquire into\r\nMary’s case, the Regent Murray appeared before them, “in the odious\r\ncharacter of the accuser of his sister, benefactress, and sovereign.”\r\nTo adopt the sentiment of the most sententious of stage moralists, When\r\ningratitude barbs the dart of injury, the wound has double danger in it.\r\n\r\nWhat touched Cortez most nearly, at the time of the expulsion from\r\nMexico, was to find the name of his trusted friend, his _intimado_, his\r\n_privado_, the secretary Duero, at the head of the paper of remonstrance\r\npresented by his disaffected soldiers. We find Louis XVI., on the eve\r\nof his execution, inquiring with calm curiosity, and as though not\r\npersonally affected, how certain members of the convention whom he knew\r\nhad voted at his trial. Told that his cousin of Orleans had voted for\r\nhis death, “Ah!” he exclaimed to Malesherbes, “that affects me more than\r\nall the rest.” It was, remarks Lamartine, the comment of Cæsar when he\r\nrecognised the face of Brutus amongst his murderers; he alone roused him\r\nto speak.\r\n\r\nSo spake the captain of Plymouth, but with more of anger in his sorrow,\r\nin the New England hexameters devoted by Longfellow to Miles Standish,\r\nwhen he charged John Alder with having supplanted, defrauded, betrayed\r\nhim:—\r\n\r\n    “Yours is the greater treason, for yours is a treason to friendship!\r\n    You, who lived under my roof, whom I cherished and loved as a brother;\r\n    You, who have fed at my board and drunk of my cup, to whose keeping\r\n    I have entrusted my honour, my thoughts the most sacred and secret,—\r\n    You too, Brutus! ah, woe to the name of friendship hereafter!”\r\n\r\nIt was the revolt of his beloved son Conrad which crushed to the earth\r\nthe emperor Henry IV. What Dean Milman calls “the almost fatal effect” of\r\nhis conduct on his father, can only be ascribed to profound affection,\r\ndeeply, cruelly, wantonly wounded. “The revolt of Conrad seemed to crush\r\nthe aged Emperor to the earth. He had borne all the vicissitudes of his\r\nearlier life with unbroken courage, he had risen from his humiliation\r\nat Canosa with refreshed energy; he now abandoned himself to despair,\r\nthrew off the robes and insignia of royalty, and was hardly prevented\r\nby his friends from falling on his own sword.”—There is a spice of the\r\n_et tu Brute_ bitterness in Becket’s exclamation to John of Poitiers,\r\nwhen even that most ardent of his admirers followed him to Etampes, and\r\nimplored him to yield. “And you too,” cried the primate, in a pang of\r\nwrath, “will you strangle us”—_ut quid nos et vos strangulatis_?—The\r\ngreat Emperor Frederick II. reproached Pope Gregory IX., in the height of\r\ntheir contest, as having been, while in the lower orders of the Church,\r\nhis familiar friend; but that no sooner had he reached the height of\r\nhis ambition than he threw off all gratitude, and became his determined\r\nfoe.—When Queen Elizabeth broke out on a party of the peers for urging\r\nher whither she would not, Norfolk she as good as called traitor and\r\nconspirator, and Pembroke she said talked like a foolish soldier; but to\r\nLeicester it was that she exclaimed, “You, my lord, you! If all the world\r\nforsook me I thought that you would be true!”—Charles I.’s celebrated\r\nletter to Prince Rupert after the loss of Bristol, depriving him of his\r\ncommand, begins with assuring him that the surrender, in such a manner,\r\nand by his trusted, no longer trusty nephew, of that most important city,\r\nwas the greatest trial of his constancy that had yet befallen him: “For\r\nwhat is to be done, after one that is so near me as you are, both in\r\nblood and friendship, submits himself to so mean an action (I give it the\r\neasiest term)? such—I have so much to say, that I will say no more of\r\nit.” The tone is that of the duke in Mr. Browning’s _Colombe’s Birthday_:\r\n\r\n    “Ah, the first bitterness is over now!\r\n    Bitter I may have felt it to confront\r\n    The truth, and ascertain those natures’ value\r\n    I had so counted on—that was a pang.”\r\n\r\nCorneille, in his historical tragedy of _Cinna_, treats in a like strain\r\nthe effect upon Augustus of the discovered conspiracy:\r\n\r\n    “Quoi! mes plus chers amis! quoi! Cinna! quoi! Maxime!\r\n    Les deux que j’honorais d’une si haute estime,\r\n    A qui j’ouvrais mon cœur, et dont j’avais fait choix\r\n    Pours les plus importants et plus nobles emplois!\r\n    Après qu’entre leurs mains j’ai remis mon empire,\r\n    Pour m’arracher le jour l’un et l’autre conspire!”\r\n\r\nBut a later scene proves that Augustus is not even yet aware of all the\r\naccomplices; and the conviction of Æmilie as one of them, wrings from\r\nhim, as Brutus from the elder Cæsar, the upbraiding cry, _Et toi, ma\r\nfille, aussi!_\r\n\r\nOne touching incident marks the horror of the murder of the Czar Paul in\r\n1801. The dress of Ouvaroff, one of the conspirators, is said to have\r\ncaused him to be mistaken by the Emperor for his son Constantine; and,\r\naccording to Bignon, the last words which the unhappy monarch uttered\r\nwere, “And you too, my Constantine!”\r\n\r\nVery worthless objects have sometimes been very undeservedly\r\nEt-tu-Brutefied. The first Lord Holland, when forsaken by the selfish\r\nfriends, as they have justly been described, with whom he had jobbed and\r\nmade merry and laughed at principle, had yet retained enough belief in\r\nthe social virtues to be made seriously unhappy by the conduct of his\r\nworthless companions, particularly by that of Rigby, the most worthless\r\nof them all;\r\n\r\n    “White-liver’d Grenville and self-loving Gower\r\n    Shall never cause one peevish moment more; ...\r\n    Slight was the pain they gave, and short its date;\r\n    I found I could not both despise and hate;\r\n    But, Rigby, what did I for thee endure?”\r\n\r\nA man as pious as Henry Fox was otherwise, has declared that he knew\r\nfew things which so darken one’s views of the moral government of God,\r\nas the experience of baseness and treachery in persons who have won our\r\nconfidence; that it tempts one to question the reality of human virtue,\r\nto suspect the hollowness of all appearance of truth and piety, whence\r\nthere is but a step to calling in question the moral purpose for which\r\nwe are placed on earth. Hawthorne somewhere intimates that the young and\r\npure are not apt to find out how actually sin is in the world, until that\r\nmiserable truth is brought home to them by the guiltiness of some trusted\r\nfriend. “Trust ye not in a friend,”—but ah, the pity of it, for him who\r\nhas to take up with these words of the Morasthite,—“A man’s enemies are\r\nthe men of his own house.”—How many variations on this general theme\r\nmight be played from Shakespeare’s plays! Sir Valentine, for instance,\r\ndenouncing the falsity of that other, so-called, but so far mis-called,\r\nGentleman of Verona:\r\n\r\n                ... “Now I dare not say\r\n    I have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.\r\n    Who should be trusted now, when one’s right hand\r\n    Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,\r\n    I am sorry I must never trust thee more,\r\n    But count the world a stranger for thy sake.\r\n    The private wound is deepest: O time most curst!\r\n    ’Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!”\r\n\r\nPolixenes, again, argues touching the breach of amity between him\r\nand Leontes, that revenge is like to be all the more bitter for the\r\ncordiality of past confidence. Then, too, the implication of Lord Scroop,\r\nof Masham, in the conspiracy with Grey and Cambridge against Henry V.,—\r\n\r\n    “Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,\r\n    Whom he hath cloy’d and graced with princely favours,—\r\n    That he should, for a foreign purse, so sell\r\n    His sovereign’s life to death and treachery!”\r\n\r\nHenry reminds Scroop that he bore the key of all his counsels, and knew\r\nthe very bottom of his soul; and he wept for _him_,—“for this revolt of\r\nthine, methinks, is like another fall of man.”—A later king of England,\r\nEdward IV., is made to despair when he sees his brother Clarence among\r\nthe supporters of the foe: “Yea, brother of Clarence, art thou here too?\r\nNay, then, I see that Edward needs must down.”—And once again, there is\r\nthe _Et tu Brute_ cue from which we started, thus set forth in all its\r\nsuggestive force by Shakespeare’s Antony:\r\n\r\n    “For Brutus, as you know, was Cæsar’s angel:\r\n    Judge, O you gods, how dearly Cæsar loved him!\r\n    This was the most unkindest cut of all:\r\n    For when the noble Cæsar saw _him_ stab,\r\n    Ingratitude, more strong than traitor’s arms,\r\n    Quite vanquish’d him: then burst his mighty heart.”\r\n\r\nBut as we recur to this, as the first among these secular annotations on\r\na Scripture text, so we recur to Scripture, in conclusion, for a pathetic\r\nparallel, also from the Book of Psalms: “For it was not an enemy that\r\nreproached me; then I could have borne it; neither was it he that hated\r\nme that did magnify himself against me: then I would have hid myself from\r\nhim. But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.\r\nWe took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in\r\ncompany.” The companionship past intensifies the cruelty present.\r\nWithout so recent and vivid a remembrance of sweet counsel together, and\r\ncompanionship hallowed by the sanctuary itself, the present cruelty could\r\nhave been borne; but with them it hardly can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“_JUDGE NOT._”\r\n\r\nST. MATTHEW vii. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nA stringent motive is adduced to enforce the strenuous monition, “Judge\r\nnot,”—and it is, “that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge,\r\nye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured\r\nto you again.” There is one Lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy;\r\neven He who hath committed all judgment unto the Son: who art thou that\r\njudgest another?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAppalled were all who gazed on the last struggles of Cardinal Beaufort,\r\nrendered hideous by the tortures of agonizing remorse. Hope had he none.\r\nDespair was impersonated in the frenzied contortions of that dying man.\r\nKing and peers stood beside the death-bed, awe-stricken and shocked. The\r\nking prayed for the cardinal, that the Eternal mover of the heavens might\r\n“look with a gentle eye upon this wretch:\r\n\r\n    O beat away the busy meddling fiend\r\n    That lays strong siege upon this wretch’s soul,\r\n    And from his bosom purge this black despair.”\r\n\r\nSee, says a less gentle observer, Warwick, how the pangs of death do make\r\nhim grin. Royal Henry, on devouter thoughts intent, bids “peace to his\r\nsoul,” in parting, “if God’s pleasure be.” And then the monarch solemnly,\r\nurgently, importunes the moribund cardinal to give some token, ere he\r\nquite depart, that Despair has not made him all her own: “Lord cardinal,\r\nif thou think’st on heaven’s bliss, hold up thy hand, make signal of\r\nthy hope.” But the cardinal—dies, and makes no sign. The appeal is\r\nfruitless: no hand is held up; no signal of hope displayed. The baffled\r\nprince, cut to the heart, can but exclaim, “He dies, and makes no sign:\r\nO God, forgive him!” Warwick again interposes a harsher voice, “So bad a\r\ndeath argues a monstrous life,” he is sure. But his sovereign hushes his\r\ndamning criticism with a right royal veto:—\r\n\r\n    “FORBEAR TO JUDGE, _for we are sinners all_.\r\n    ...\r\n    Close up his eyes, and draw the curtain close;\r\n    And let us all to meditation.”\r\n\r\nForbear to judge. And the Shakspearean Henry practises in person the\r\nmonition thus enforced. It is his rule to check in himself every tendency\r\nto uncharitable judgment. As when proof all but positive distresses him\r\nof his uncle Gloster’s death being due to violence, he yet restrains the\r\nbent of his convictions by the prayer,—\r\n\r\n    “O Thou that judgest all things, stay my thoughts:\r\n    My thoughts, that labour to persuade my soul\r\n    Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey’s life!\r\n    If my suspèct be false, forgive me, God;\r\n    For judgment only doth belong to Thee!”\r\n\r\nIt is by the deathbed of the man self-convicted of Duke Humphrey’s death,\r\nthat Henry can yet say, even of him, when from so bad a death is argued a\r\nmonstrous life, Forbear to judge, for we are sinners all.\r\n\r\nAre we to infer that Shakspeare was himself for backing to the full this\r\nroyal veto? That, perhaps, were going too far. The veto is dramatically\r\ntrue to character, and designedly characteristic of the royal speaker.\r\nBut if Shakspeare himself (we are assuming him to _be_ the author of this\r\ndisputed play) would or could scarcely in this particular instance have\r\nenforced such a lesson of charity, we may at least be assured, from\r\nthe large tolerance and subtle apprehension so patent in his own kingly\r\nnature, that he would in spirit have echoed the king’s _forbear_. Perhaps\r\nhis own feeling might be as nearly as possible expressed in other words\r\nof his, put into the mouth of quite another character, and referring to\r\nquite another occasion:—\r\n\r\n    “And how his audit stands, who knows, save heaven?\r\n    But, in our circumstance and course of thought,\r\n    ’Tis heavy with him.”\r\n\r\nForbear to judge, is, nevertheless, the moral of this strain, as of the\r\nother. Human ignorance in the one case, human frailty in the other, ousts\r\nhuman nature from the judgment-seat.\r\n\r\nNo man, avers Sir Thomas Browne, can justly censure or condemn another;\r\nbecause, in fact, no man truly knows another. “This I perceive in myself;\r\nfor I am in the dark to all the world, and my nearest friends behold me\r\nbut in a cloud.... Further, no man can judge another, because no man\r\nknows himself.” In a former section of this his profession of faith, this\r\ngood physician warns those who, upon a rigid application of the law,\r\nsentence Solomon unto damnation,[19] that they condemn not only him, but\r\nthemselves, and the whole world; “for, by the letter and written word\r\nof God, we are without exception in the state of death: but there is a\r\nprerogative of God, and an arbitrary pleasure above the letter of His\r\nown law, by which alone we can pretend unto salvation, and through which\r\nSolomon might be as easily saved as those who condemn him.”\r\n\r\nThe Vicar of Gravenhurst, in his position of parish priest, owns himself\r\ncompelled to confess that the best people are not the best in every\r\nrelation of life, and the worst not bad in every relation of life; so\r\nthat, with experience, he finds himself growing lenient in his blame, if\r\nalso reticent in his praise. “Again and again I say to myself that only\r\nthe Omniscient can be the equitable judge of human beings—so complicated\r\nare our virtues with our failings, and so many are the hidden virtues,\r\nas well as hidden vices, of our fellow-men.” If judge at all we dare, and\r\ndo, be it in the spirit and to the letter of Wordsworth’s counsel:—\r\n\r\n    “From all rash censure be the mind kept free;\r\n    He only judges right who weighs, compares,\r\n    And, in the sternest sentence which his voice\r\n    Pronounces, ne’er abandons Charity.”\r\n\r\nWell and wisely said La Bruyère, that “La règle de Descartes, qui ne\r\nveut pas que l’on décide sur les moindres vérités avant qu’elles soient\r\nconnues clairement et distinctement, est assez belle et assez juste pour\r\ndevoir s’étendu au jugement que l’on fait des personnes.” Real character,\r\nas William Hazlitt says, is not one thing, but a thousand things: actual\r\nqualities do not conform to any factitious standard in the mind, but\r\nrest upon their own truth and nature. “The dull stupor under which we\r\nlabour in respect of those whom we have the greatest opportunities of\r\ninspecting nearly, we should do well to imitate, before we give extreme\r\nand uncharitable verdicts against those whom we only see in passing, or\r\nat a distance.”\r\n\r\n                      “Well—after all—\r\n    What know we of the secret of a man?\r\n    His nerves were wrong. What ails us; who are sound,\r\n    That we should mimic this raw fool, the world,\r\n    Which charts us all in its coarse blacks or whites,\r\n    As ruthless as a baby with a worm,\r\n    As cruel as a schoolboy ere he grows\r\n    To pity—more from ignorance than will.”\r\n\r\nWho can say, asks Samuel Rogers, “In such circumstances I should have\r\ndone otherwise?” Who, did he but reflect by what slow gradations, often\r\nby how many strange occurrences, we are led astray; with how much\r\nreluctance, how much agony, how many efforts to escape, how many sighs,\r\nhow many tears—who, did he but reflect for a moment, would have the heart\r\nto cast a stone?[20]\r\n\r\nThe autobiographer of one of Mr. Wilkie Collins’s earlier fictions\r\nproposes in an opening chapter to give a sketch of his character. But\r\nhe sensibly refrains from the execution of a too ambitious plan. For,\r\n“what man can say: I will sound the depth of my own vices and measure the\r\nheight of my own virtues; and be as good as his word? We can neither know\r\nnor judge ourselves—others may judge, but cannot know us—God alone judges\r\nand knows too.”\r\n\r\n    “Who made the heart, ’tis He alone\r\n      Decidedly can try us;\r\n    He knows each chord—its various tone,\r\n      Each spring, its various bias:\r\n    Then at the balance let’s be mute,\r\n      We never can adjust it.”\r\n\r\nDunsford the essayist’s objection to all hasty judgment of our\r\nfellow-creatures is based on the ground of its being “such an\r\nunscientific proceeding.” You comment, he says, upon another man’s\r\nconduct, and attribute motives to him. Now an ingenious and imaginative\r\nperson—a lawyer making a speech for him—might show many different motives\r\nof equal probability. You fix upon one, perhaps because it is consonant\r\nto your own mind and nature, or because it is the uppermost or easiest\r\none to conjecture; but really you often ignore the doctrine of chances,\r\nand perhaps you will find upon strict calculation that the chances are\r\nfairly four to one against your having named the right motive. As the\r\nwinning horse is often “a dark one,” at any rate not the favourite, so\r\nafter all some obscure and improbable motive is often the true cause of\r\na man’s actions. In short, Dunsford maintains that our condemnation of\r\nothers is often as unscientific as it is unchristian.\r\n\r\nWhen the Doge of Venice, Foscari, in Byron’s tragedy, agitated by the\r\nsummons to judge his son, speculates somewhat wildly on the burden of the\r\nmystery of all this unintelligible world, Marina submissively suggests\r\nthat\r\n\r\n            “These are things we cannot judge\r\n    On earth.”\r\n\r\nAnd how then, demands the old man,—\r\n\r\n    “And how then shall we judge each other,\r\n    Who are all earth?”\r\n\r\nMr. Lockhart, in the closing chapter of his admirable Life of Scott,\r\nquoting Keble’s lines,—\r\n\r\n    “Not even the tenderest heart, and next our own,\r\n    Knows half the reasons why we smile or sigh,”\r\n\r\ndeclares considerations of this kind to have always induced him to regard\r\nwith small respect any attempt to delineate fully and exactly any human\r\nbeing’s character. He avows his distrust of our capacity for, even in\r\nvery humble cases, judging our neighbour fairly; and cannot but pity\r\nthe presumption that must swell in the heart and brain of any ordinary\r\nbrother of the race, when daring to pronounce, _ex cathedrâ_, on the\r\nwhole structure and complexion of a great mind, from the comparatively\r\nnarrow and scanty materials which can by possibility have been placed\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\nMen who see _into_ their neighbours, observes Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes,\r\nare very apt to be contemptuous; but men who see _through_ them find\r\nsomething lying behind every human soul which it is not for them to sit\r\nin judgment on, or to attempt to sneer out of the order of God’s manifold\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\nThe same wise-hearted writer—wise of heart as well as head—has a dialogue\r\nbetween doctor and minister concerning a quasi-reprobate, to whom the\r\nformer has been kind, and about whose destiny the other is hardly more\r\nsevere than certain. “Bad enough, no doubt,” Doctor Kittredge owns\r\nthis scampish half-breed to be; “but might be worse. Has some humanity\r\nleft in him yet. Let him go. God can judge him—I can’t.” “You are too\r\ncharitable, doctor,” objects the minister. “He has saved his neck—but\r\nhis soul is a lost one, I am afraid, beyond question.” “I can’t judge\r\nmen’s souls,” the doctor replies. “I can judge their acts, and hold them\r\nresponsible for those; but I don’t know much about their souls. If you\r\nor I had found our soul in a half-breed body, and then been turned loose\r\nto run among the Indians, we might have been playing just such tricks\r\nas this fellow has been trying.” What said a greater doctor when Boswell\r\nasked him whether, in the case of an aggressor forcing on a duel by\r\nill usage, and getting killed in it, there is not almost no “ground to\r\nhope that he is gone to a state of happiness”? “Sir,” said Johnson, “we\r\nare not to judge determinately of the state in which a man leaves this\r\nlife. He may in a moment have repented effectually.” And then Johnson\r\nquoted, apparently with approval, at any rate with hopeful interest,\r\nan epitaph, from Camden’s Remains, upon a very wicked man, who was\r\nkilled by a fall from his horse, in which epitaph he is supposed to say,\r\n“Between the stirrup and the ground, I mercy asked, I mercy found.” On\r\nanother occasion Johnson appealed to Richard Baxter’s avowed belief that\r\na suicide—if hurried by sudden passion to self-slaughter—may be saved.\r\nAnd “if,” says Baxter, “it should be objected that what I maintain may\r\nencourage suicide, I answer, I am not to tell a lie to prevent it.” Who,\r\nas Campbell asks, after surmising that the hand which smote its kindred\r\nheart, might yet be prone to deeds of mercy,—\r\n\r\n        ... “Who may understand\r\n    Thy many woes, poor suicide, unknown?\r\n    He who thy being gave shall judge of thee alone.”\r\n\r\n_Qualis vita, finis ita_, is a rhyming proverb not quite worthy of all\r\nacceptation. That Country Parson whose Recreations made him a name (such\r\nname, at least, as four initials may comprise) declares himself to have\r\nno look but one of sorrow and pity to cast on the poor suicide’s grave,\r\nand thinks the common English verdict is right as well as charitable,\r\nwhich supposes that in every such case reason has become unhinged, and\r\nresponsibility is gone. “No doubt it is the saddest of all sad ends; but\r\nI do not forget that a certain Authority, the highest of all authorities,\r\nsaid to all human beings, ‘Judge not, that ye be not judged.’ The writer\r\nhas, in the course of his duty, looked upon more than one suicide’s dead\r\nface; and the lines of Hood appeared to sketch the fit feeling with which\r\nto do so:—\r\n\r\n    “‘Owning her weakness,\r\n      Her evil behaviour;\r\n    And leaving, with meekness,\r\n      Her soul to her Saviour.’”\r\n\r\nA different spirit informs the Kirk from the day when Wishart complained\r\nthat, in their arrogance, her ministers, “as if they had been privy to\r\nthe councils of God, or the dispensers of His vengeance to the world,”\r\npresumed to pronounce upon the future state of their adversaries, and\r\n“doomed them, both body and soul, to eternal torments.” Pity but the\r\npoet had been better man and Christian who wrote these strong lines on\r\ndamnatory sentences _de mortuis_, even when there remains nought to show—\r\n\r\n                ... “save a life misspent,—\r\n    And soul—but who shall answer where it went?\r\n    ’Tis ours to bear, not judge the dead; and they\r\n    Who doom to hell, themselves are on the way,\r\n    Unless those bullies of eternal pains\r\n    Are pardoned their bad hearts for their worse brains.”\r\n\r\nMore in a reverent spirit, and in a farther-seeing one, is the mystic\r\nfinale of the Laureate’s memorable Vision of Sin, and its open verdict on\r\nthe obscure crime of a great criminal:—\r\n\r\n    “At last I heard a voice upon the slope\r\n    Cry to the summit, ‘Is there any hope?’\r\n    To which an answer pealed from that high land,\r\n    _But in a tongue no man could understand_;\r\n    And on the glimmering limit far withdrawn,\r\n    God made Himself an awful rose of dawn.”\r\n\r\nNever let it be forgotten, insists a Quarterly Reviewer, that there is\r\nscarcely a single moral action of a single human being of which other men\r\nhave such a knowledge—its ultimate grounds, its surrounding incidents,\r\nand the real determining causes of its merits,—as to warrant their\r\npronouncing a conclusive judgment.\r\n\r\nThe writings of Mr. Arthur Helps are honourably distinguished by an\r\noft-recurring plea for mutual tolerance, on the ground of the little we\r\nreally know one of another. In “Companions of my Solitude,” for instance,\r\nthe author remarks that were it only considered how utterly incompetent\r\nmen are to talk of the conduct of others as they do, the talkers would\r\noften be silenced at once, and the sufferers as readily consoled. Take\r\nthe one question merely of difference of temperament—which, amongst men,\r\nis probably as great as that amongst the different species of animals—as\r\nbetween that, for example, of the lively squirrel and the solemn crane.\r\n“Now, if only from this difference between them, the squirrel would be a\r\nbad judge of the felicity, or generosity, or the domestic conduct, of the\r\ncrane.\r\n\r\n“Probably when we are thinking or talking of a person, we recall some\r\nvisual image of that person. I have thought what an instructive thing it\r\nwould be, if under some magic influence—like that, for example, which\r\nwould construct a ‘palace of truth’—it were arranged that as we gave out\r\nour comments on the character or conduct of any person, this image on the\r\nretina of memory should change according to the truth, or rather the want\r\nof it, in our remarks. Gradually, feature after feature would steal away\r\ntill we gazed at nonentity, or we should find another image glide into\r\nthe field of view,—somebody we had never seen, perhaps, but to whom the\r\ncomments we were uttering really did apply.”\r\n\r\nAccordingly, our author would have the sufferers from injurious and\r\nunjust comment treat the whole thing as one which lacked reality.\r\nNo thoughtful man, he urges, ought to be long vexed at such stuff,\r\nimmaterial in every sense: such stuff as dreams are made of.\r\n\r\nIn one of his Dialogues, again, he makes Dunsford declare the most\r\ncurious thing, as regards people living together, to be the intense\r\nignorance they sometimes are in of each other. And Milverton follows up\r\nthe remark by adding, that people fulfil a relation towards each other,\r\nand only know each other in that relation: they perform orbits round each\r\nother, each gyrating, too, upon his own axis, so that there are parts of\r\nthe character of each which are never brought into view of the other. In\r\nanother Dialogue, Milverton refers to the habit divines have of reminding\r\nus, that, in forming our ideas of the government of Providence, we should\r\nrecollect that we see only a fragment. The same observation, in its\r\ndegree, he holds to be true as regards human conduct. “We see a little\r\nbit here and there, and assume the nature of the whole. Even a very silly\r\nman’s actions are often more to the purpose than his friends’ comments on\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nIn yet another of his works, this popular essay-writer devotes an entire\r\nessay to the subject of our judgments of other men. Who does not feel, he\r\nasks, that to describe with fidelity the least portion of the entangled\r\nnature that is within him would be no easy matter? And yet the same man\r\nwho feels this, and who, perhaps, would be ashamed of talking at hazard\r\nabout the properties of a flower, of a weed, of some figure in geometry,\r\nwill put forth his guesses about the character of his brother-man, as if\r\nhe had the fullest authority for all that he was saying. It is shown in\r\ndetail how an opinion of some man’s character and conduct gets abroad\r\nwhich is formed after a wrong method, by prejudiced persons, upon a\r\nfalse statement of facts, respecting a matter which they cannot possibly\r\nunderstand; and how this is then left to be inflated by Folly, and blown\r\nabout by Idleness.\r\n\r\nThere is among Wordsworth’s Poems on the Naming of Places, one which is\r\nmemorable if only as containing one of the most admired lines he ever\r\nwrote, descriptive of Lady of the Mere—\r\n\r\n    “Sole-sitting by the shores of old romance,”\r\n\r\n—but which is also pertinent to the present occasion, as pointing a\r\nmoral, after the poet’s wont to moralise his song. A man had been seen in\r\nthe distance by the poet and his friends, angling. No great harm in that,\r\nmy masters? Nay; but the angler was in peasant’s garb, and the season was\r\nmid-harvest, and therefore, and on the spot, they voted him improvident\r\nand reckless. But when they came up to him, these over-hasty judges\r\nfound in the man they had summarily condemned, a poor mortal wasted by\r\nsickness, and all too weak to labour in the harvest-field, but using his\r\nbest skill to gain a pittance from the dead unfeeling lake that knew not\r\nof his wants:—\r\n\r\n                                “I will not say\r\n    What thoughts immediately were ours, nor how\r\n    The happy idleness of that sweet morn\r\n    With all its lovely images, was changed\r\n    To serious musing and to self-reproach.\r\n    Nor did we fail to see within ourselves\r\n    What need there is to be reserved in speech,\r\n    And temper all our thoughts with charity.\r\n    —Therefore, unwilling to forget that day,\r\n    My friend, myself, and she who then received\r\n    The same admonishment, have called the place\r\n    By a memorial name, uncouth indeed\r\n    As e’er by mariner was given to bay\r\n    Or foreland on a new-discovered coast;\r\n    And POINT RASH-JUDGMENT is the name it bears.”[21]\r\n\r\nForbear to judge: for how pitifully little is the all we really know one\r\nof another! Mr. Froude has forcibly remarked—even admitting the remark\r\nto be a truism—that whoever has attended but slightly to the phenomena\r\nof human nature has discovered how inadequate is the clearest insight\r\nwhich he can hope to attain into character and disposition. “Every one is\r\na perplexity to himself and a perplexity to his neighbours; and men who\r\nare born in the same generation, who are exposed to the same influences,\r\ntrained by the same teachers, and live from childhood to age in constant\r\nand familiar intercourse, are often little more than shadows to each\r\nother, intelligible in superficial form and outline, but divided inwardly\r\nby impalpable and mysterious barriers.” And yet how ready each “weak\r\nunknowing hand” to hurl the bolts of Heaven against whomsoever it deems\r\nto be Heaven’s foe.\r\n\r\nSir James Stephen bids all hail to Rhadamanthus on his posthumous\r\njudgment-seat in the nether regions. But when Rhadamanthus comes\r\nabove ground, holds in his hand the historical pen, and resolves all\r\nthe enigmas of hearts which ceased to beat long centuries ago, more\r\nconfidently than most of us would dare to interpret the mysteries of\r\nown, Sir James for one wishes him back again at the confluence of Styx,\r\nPhlegethon, and Cocytus. For, “it is, after all, nothing more than\r\nthe surface of human character which the retrospective scrutiny of the\r\nkeenest human eye is able to detect.” It is in a subsequent portion of\r\nthe same instructive treatise, that the writer pronounces human justice\r\nto be severe, not merely because man is censorious, but because he\r\nreasonably distrusts himself, and fears lest his weakness should confound\r\nthe distinctions of good and evil; and Divine justice to be lenient,\r\nbecause there alone love can flow in all its unfathomable depths and\r\nboundless expansion, impeded by no dread of error, and diverted by no\r\nmisplaced sympathies.[22]\r\n\r\nIn the course of some remarks on the harshness with which man is disposed\r\nto regard the fellow-man whose doctrine, in matters of religious faith,\r\ndiffers from his own, the author of the “Caxton Essays” is impressive\r\non the fact that He who hath reserved to Himself the right of judging,\r\nhas imperatively said to man, whose faculty of judging must be, like\r\nman himself, erring and human, “Judge not, that ye be not judged.” Now,\r\nargues the essayist, of all our offences, it is clear that that offence\r\nof which man can be the least competent judge is an offence of defective\r\nfaith. “For faith belongs to our innermost hearts, and not to our overt\r\nactions. And religious faith is therefore that express tribute to the\r\nonly Reader of all hearts, on the value of which man can never, without\r\narrogant presumption, set himself up as judge.”\r\n\r\nIf even-handed justice, says Mr. Anthony Trollope, were done throughout\r\nthe world, some apology would be found for most offences. Not that\r\nthe offences would thus be wiped away, and black become white; but\r\nmuch that is now very black would, he submits, be reduced to that\r\nsombre, uninviting shade of ordinary brown which is so customary to\r\nhumanity.“[23] It is much the same humane thought which underlies\r\nPelayo’s apology for Roderick, when we read how closely that generous\r\nprince would and did\r\n\r\n    ... “cherish in his heart the constant thought\r\n    Something was yet untold, which, being known,\r\n    Would palliate his offence, and make the fall\r\n    Of one till then so excellently good,\r\n    Less monstrous, less revolting to belief,\r\n    More to be pitied, more to be forgiven.”\r\n\r\nAs one of George Eliot’s good parsons has it, God sees us as we are\r\naltogether, not in separate feelings or actions, as our fellow-men see\r\nus. We are always doing each other injustice, and thinking better or\r\nworse of each other than we deserve, he says, because we only hear and\r\nsee separate words and actions—not each other’s whole nature. Do not\r\nphilosophic doctors tell us, again, the reflective author in person\r\nelsewhere muses, that we are unable to discern so much as a tree,\r\nexcept by an unconscious cunning which combines many past and separate\r\nsensations; that no one sense is independent of another, so that in the\r\ndark we can hardly taste a fricassee, or tell whether our pipe is alight\r\nor not, and the most intelligent boy, if accommodated with claws or hoofs\r\ninstead of fingers, would be likely to remain on the lowest form? If\r\nso, it is easy to understand that our discernment of men’s motives must\r\ndepend on the completeness of the elements we can bring from our own\r\nsusceptibility and our own experience. “See to it, friend, before you\r\npronounce a too hasty judgment, that your own moral sensibilities are\r\nnot of a hoofed or clawed character.” For, as this penetrating writer\r\ninsists, in continuation of the metaphor, the keenest eye will not serve,\r\nunless you have the delicate fingers, with their subtile nerve filaments,\r\nwhich elude scientific lenses, and lose themselves in the invisible\r\nworld of human sensations.\r\n\r\nDeeds which, to quote another popular though less powerful penwoman,\r\nour acquaintance designate our follies, may at another tribunal be our\r\nvirtues—our single redeeming points; who judges rightly, who can rightly\r\njudge, where so many of our efforts are bent to seem other than we are,\r\nand the universal conjuring trick of this world is to throw dust expertly\r\nin our neighbours’ eyes?\r\n\r\nCenturies ago, well-nigh two score, it was written by the most\r\nphilosophic, and perhaps the best, of Roman emperors, that men’s actions\r\nlook worse than they are; and, says he, “one must be thoroughly informed\r\nof a great many things before one can be rightly qualified to give\r\njudgment in the case.” The sceptic Bayle was a better Christian than\r\nScaliger, when he protested against the assertion of that peremptory\r\nscholar that Bellarmin did not believe a word of what he wrote, and\r\nwas at heart an atheist: besides the testimony of Bellarmin’s life and\r\ndeathbed to the contrary, such judgments are, said Bayle (and no friend\r\nto the Jesuits he), a usurpation of the rights of One who alone is the\r\nJudge of hearts, and before whom there is no dissembling.\r\n\r\nAn apostle’s reason given for the counsel, Speak not evil one of another,\r\nbrethren,—is this: that whoso speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth\r\nhis brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law. Now, there\r\nis one Lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy; who art thou that\r\njudgest another?\r\n\r\n                        “Oh what are we,\r\n    Frail creatures as we are, that we should sit\r\n    In judgment man on man! and what were we,\r\n    If the All-merciful should mete to us\r\n    With the same rigorous measure wherewithal\r\n    Sinner to sinner metes!”\r\n\r\nNo observant reader of Mr. Carlyle but will have noticed, if not (which\r\nwere better) laid to heart, his habitual abstention from that dogmatism\r\nof the judgment-seat in which smaller spirits delight. For instance, in\r\nhis moral estimate of so erring a genius as Hoffmann, if, in judging\r\nhim, Mr. Carlyle is forced to condemn him, it is with mildness, with a\r\ndesire to do justice. Let us not forget, urges the critic, that for a\r\nmind like Hoffmann’s, the path of propriety was difficult to find—still\r\nmore difficult to keep. “Moody, sensitive, and fantastic, he wandered\r\nthrough the world like a foreign presence, subject to influences of which\r\ncommon natures have happily no glimpse.” A good or a wise man we must\r\nnot call him; but among the ordinary population of this world, “to note\r\nhim with the mark of reprobation were ungrateful and unjust.” So, again,\r\nin the same author’s review of the life and writings of Werner—who,\r\nalways in some degree an enigma to himself, may well be obscure to us.\r\nFor “there are mysteries and unsounded abysses in every human heart; and\r\nthat is but a questionable philosophy which undertakes so readily to\r\nexplain them.” Religious belief especially, Mr. Carlyle urges, at least\r\nwhen it seems heartfelt and well-intentioned, is no subject for harsh\r\nor even irreverent investigation. “He is a wise man that, having such a\r\nbelief, knows and sees clearly the grounds of it in himself; and those,\r\nwe imagine, who have explored with strictest scrutiny the secret of their\r\nown bosoms, will be least apt to rush with intolerant violence into that\r\nof other men’s.” Still more elaborate and emphatic is the exposition\r\nof this doctrine as applied to the case of Robert Burns. The world, it\r\nis alleged, is habitually unjust in its judgments of such men, since\r\nit decides, like a court of law, by dead statutes, and not positively\r\nbut negatively,—less on what is done right, than on what is or is not\r\ndone wrong. Whereas, by Mr. Carlyle’s doctrine, not the few inches of\r\ndeflection from the mathematical orbit, which are so easily measured,\r\nbut the _ratio_ of these to the whole diameter, constitutes the real\r\naberration. “This orbit may be a planet’s, its diameter the breadth of\r\nthe solar system; or it may be a city hippodrome; nay, the circle of\r\na ginhorse, its diameter a score of feet or paces. But the inches of\r\ndeflection only are measured; and it is assumed that the diameter of the\r\nginhorse, and that of the planet, will yield the same ratio when compared\r\nto them!” Here, according to our author, lies the root of many a blind,\r\ncruel condemnation of Burnses, Swifts, Rousseaus, which one never listens\r\nto with approval. “Granted, the ship comes into harbour with shrouds and\r\ntackle damaged; the pilot is blameworthy; he has not been all-wise and\r\nall-powerful: but to know _how_ blameworthy, tell us first whether his\r\nvoyage has been round the globe, or only to Ramsgate and the Isle of\r\nDogs.”\r\n\r\nTo a very different style of sinners the same judgment—rather the same\r\nrefusal to judge—is accorded, when the doom of Chaumette, Gobel, and\r\nother reddest of red-republican reprobates, is rehearsed, in the history\r\nof France’s reign of terror, while the revolution was devouring so\r\ngreedily her own children. “For Anaxagoras Chaumette, the sleek head now\r\n[April 1794] stript of its _bonnet rouge_ [and a traveller by tumbril to\r\nSainte Guillotine], what hope is there? Unless Death _were_ ‘an eternal\r\nsleep’? Wretched Anaxagoras! God shall judge thee, not I.”\r\n\r\nOnce more: “Unhappy soul! who shall judge him?” is the historian’s\r\ndeprecating query in the instance of August of Poland, the physically\r\nstrong,—who dies, confessedly a _very_ great sinner, early in 1733. Who\r\nshall judge him?\r\n\r\n    “Hereafter?—And do you think to look\r\n    On the terrible pages of that Book\r\n      To find his failings, faults, and errors?\r\n    Ah, you will then have other cares,\r\n    In your own shortcomings and despairs,\r\n      In your own secret sins and terrors!”\r\n\r\nCorporal Trim was once moved to avow his belief—rather hotly, for his\r\n_esprit de corps_ was piqued—that when a soldier “gets time to pray, he\r\nprays as heartily as a parson—though not with all his fuss and hypocrisy.\r\nThou shouldst not have said that, Trim, said my uncle Toby—for God only\r\nknows who is a hypocrite, and who is not. At the great and general review\r\nof us all, Corporal, at the day of judgment (and not till then)—it will\r\nbe seen who have done their duties in this world, and who have not.”\r\n\r\nIn a like spirit, another clerical novelist, of a more recent type,\r\nand whose distinctive evangel is Muscular Christianity, introduces a\r\n“double-first” candidate for orders who reminds him of Mr. Bye-Ends in\r\nBunyan: “And yet,” comes the charitable clause conditional, “I believe\r\nthe man was really in earnest. He was really desirous to do what was\r\nright, as far as he knew it; and all the more desirous, because he saw,\r\nin the present state of society, what was right would pay him. God shall\r\njudge him, not I. Who can unravel the confusion of mingled selfishness\r\nand devotion that exist even in his own heart, much less in that of\r\nanother?”\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Thackeray’s instance, exception has been taken, on ethical\r\ngrounds, by no vulgar critic, to his habit of shrinking from moral\r\nestimate as well as moral judgment, in dealing with his characters.\r\nInto that distinction not without a difference, this is not the place\r\n(nor this the pen) to enter. But the critic in question—for some years\r\na main support of the _National Review_—recognises this avoidance of\r\nmoral judgment as springing from kindly feeling, from the just and humble\r\nsense we all should have that our own demerits make it unseemly for us to\r\nascend the judgment-chair, and from a wide appreciation of the variety\r\nand obscurity of men’s real motives of action.[24]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_PART-KNOWLEDGE._\r\n\r\n1 CORINTHIANS xiii. 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n“We know in part,” said the apostle; who, therefore, prophesied in part;\r\nalways with the assurance that when that which is perfect is come, then\r\nshall that which is in part be done away. Meanwhile, we see through a\r\nglass darkly, through a medium obscurely—“now I know in part.”\r\n\r\nIf so it was with him that once was caught up into the third heavens,\r\nmuch more with his readers. For we are but of yesterday, and know\r\nnothing. “Behold, God is great, and we know Him not.” At the height of\r\nour knowledge we can but fall back upon the old saying, “Lo, these are\r\nparts of His ways; but how little a portion is heard of Him!” And when\r\nwe consider the heavens, the work of His hands; the moon and the stars,\r\nwhich He hath ordained; the earth beneath, the ocean round about, the\r\nwaters under the earth, the pent-up fires within it,—verily He is a God\r\nthat hideth Himself still, and that revealeth but a portion of His work,\r\nclouds and darkness covering the rest. His thoughts are very deep; and\r\nwhat is man that he should know them, or the son of man that he should\r\nfind them out unto perfection? From the topmost pinnacles attained by\r\nscience he can see but the utmost part of them, and cannot see them all.\r\n\r\nLocke argues the intellectual and sensible world to be in this perfectly\r\nalike: that the part which we see of them holds no proportion with\r\nwhat we see not; and that whatsoever we can reach with our eyes, or\r\nour thoughts, of either of them, is but a point, almost nothing, in\r\ncomparison with the rest. Shall he whose birth, maturity, and age, as\r\nBeattie has it, scarce fill the circle of one summer day—shall the\r\npoor gnat conclude nature in collapse because of a passing cloud, not\r\ntransparent to the insect’s vision?\r\n\r\n    “One part, one little part, we dimly scan\r\n      Through the dark medium of life’s feverish dream;\r\n    Yet dare arraign the whole stupendous plan,\r\n      If but that little part incongruous seem.\r\n      Nor is that part perhaps what mortals deem;\r\n    Oft from apparent ill our blessings rise.\r\n      Oh then renounce that impious self-esteem,\r\n    That aims to trace the secrets of the skies;\r\n    For thou art but of dust: be humble and be wise.”\r\n\r\nFreethinking Lord Shaftesbury begins a section of his “Characteristics”\r\nwith the remark, that when we reflect on any ordinary frame or\r\nconstitution, either of art or nature, and consider how hard it is to\r\ngive the least account of a particular _part_ without a competent\r\nknowledge of the _whole_, we need not wonder to find ourselves at a loss\r\nin many things relating to the constitution and frame of the universe.\r\nElsewhere he suggestively observes, that in an infinity of things\r\nmutually relative, a mind which sees not infinitely, can see nothing\r\nfully; “and since each particular has relation to all in general, it can\r\nknow no perfect or true relation of anything in a world not perfectly and\r\nfully known.” And supposing the case of an ignorant landsman presuming\r\nto question the details of a ship’s rigging, his lordship breaks out\r\ninto the apostrophe, “O my friend, let us not thus betray our ignorance,\r\nbut consider where we are, and in what a universe. Think of the many\r\nparts of the vast machine in which we have so little insight, and of\r\nwhich it is impossible we should know the ends and uses; when instead of\r\nseeing to the highest pennons, we see only some lower deck, and are in\r\nthis dark case of flesh, confined even to the hold and meanest station\r\nof the vessel.” There is Mrs. Browning’s usual energy of diction in the\r\nexclamation,\r\n\r\n                  “Ay, we are forced, so pent,\r\n    To judge the whole too partially, confound\r\n    Conclusions. Is there any common phrase\r\n    Significant, when the adverb’s heard alone,\r\n    The verb being absent, and the pronoun out?\r\n    But we, distracted in the roar of life,\r\n    Still insolently at God’s adverb snatch,\r\n    And bruit against Him that His thought is void,\r\n    His meaning hopeless.”\r\n\r\nThe same good Providence, as Madame de Sévigné writes, that governs all,\r\nshall one day unravel all; we poor mortals being, in the meanwhile, so\r\nmany all but stone-blind and utterly ignorant lookers-on. We suffer,\r\nas the author of “Thorndale” says—there is no doubt about that—and we\r\nnaturally speak and think under the sharp pang of our present agony; but\r\nthe ultimate and overruling judgment which we form of human life, should\r\nbe taken from some calm, impersonal point of view. “We should command\r\nthe widest horizon possible. Of the great whole of humanity we see but a\r\nlittle at a time. We pause sometimes on the lights only of the picture,\r\nsometimes only on the shadows. How very dark those shadows seem! Yet if\r\nwe could embrace in our view the whole of the picture, perhaps the very\r\ndarkest shadows might be recognised as effective or inevitable portions\r\nof a grand harmonious whole.” How closes Thomson his poem of “The\r\nSeasons,” drear Winter then his cue?—with the memorable lines:—\r\n\r\n                  “Ye good distress’d!\r\n    Ye noble few! who here unbending stand\r\n    Beneath life’s pressure, yet bear up awhile;\r\n    And what your bounded view, which only saw\r\n    A little part, deemed evil, is no more:\r\n    The storms of wintry time will quickly pass,\r\n    And one unbounded spring encircle all.”\r\n\r\nThe theme of our part knowledge, so strictly cabin’d, cribb’d, confined,\r\nis one to which Thomson repeatedly recurs. For instance, in an earlier\r\nbook:—\r\n\r\n                “But here the cloud,\r\n    So wills Eternal Providence, sits deep.\r\n    Enough for us to know that this dark state,\r\n    In wayward passions lost, and vain pursuits,\r\n    This infancy of being, cannot prove\r\n    The final issue of the works of God,\r\n    By boundless love and perfect wisdom form’d\r\n    And ever rising with the rising mind.”\r\n\r\nAgain, with emphasis and discretion (as Polonius says), he puts the query—\r\n\r\n    “Shall little haughty ignorance pronounce\r\n    His works unwise, of which the smallest part\r\n    Exceeds the narrow vision of her mind?\r\n    As if upon a full proportioned dome,\r\n    On swelling columns heaved, the pride of art,\r\n    A critic-fly, whose feeble ray scarce spreads\r\n    An inch around, with blind presumption bold,\r\n    Should dare to tax the structure of the whole.”\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole makes use of a similar figure in one of his three or four\r\nthousand published letters: “We are poor silly animals: we live for an\r\ninstant upon a particle of a boundless universe, and are much like a\r\nbutterfly that should argue about the nature of the seasons, and what\r\ncreates their vicissitudes, and does not exist itself to see one annual\r\nrevolution of them.”\r\n\r\n    “Earth’s number-scale is near us set;\r\n    The total God alone can see;\r\n    But each some fraction.”[25]\r\n\r\nAddison, in one of his essays, comments on the body of an animal as an\r\nobject comparatively adequate to our senses, it being a particular part\r\nof Providence that lies within a narrow compass, so that the eye is able\r\nto command it, and by successive inquiries to search into all its parts.\r\nCould the body of the whole earth, he goes on to say, or indeed the whole\r\nuniverse, be thus subjected to the examination of our senses, were it\r\nnot too big and disproportioned for our inquiries, too unwieldy for the\r\nmanagement of the eye and hand, “there is no question but it would appear\r\nto us as curious and well-contrived a frame as that of a human body. We\r\nshould see the same concatenation and subserviency, the same necessity\r\nand usefulness, the same beauty and harmony, in all and every of its\r\nparts, as what we discover in the body of every single animal.” To adopt\r\nan illustration of Fénélon’s to the same purpose: imagine the letters\r\nof a sentence to be so enormous in size, that a man could only make out\r\none of them at a time; in that case he could not read, that is, collect\r\nthe letters together and discover the sense of them in combination. So\r\nit is, argues the benign prelate, with the _grands traits_ of Providence\r\nin the conduct of the world at large during the lapse of centuries. It\r\nis only the whole that is intelligible, and the whole is too vast to\r\nbe scrutinised near at hand. Each event in the process of ages is like\r\na separate letter or sign, which is too large for our petty organs,\r\nand which is without a meaning when taken apart from the rest. A more\r\nvigorous philosopher than the gentle Fénélon compares the universe to\r\na picture, the beauty of which is then alone perceptible when the true\r\nstand-point of perspective is taken. There are certain inventions in\r\nperspective, or certain beautiful designs, he says, which look all\r\nconfusion until you either inspect them from the right point of view, or\r\nmake use of some kind of glass or mirror as the medium of observation. In\r\nthe same manner the apparent deformities of our fractional side-views,\r\nresolve themselves into harmonious unity when the eye is directed aright.\r\n\r\nDr. Johnson was in an unwontedly placid and benignant frame of mind, by\r\nBoswell’s account, when the two stood together, one serene autumn night,\r\nin Dr. Taylor’s garden, and the sage delivered himself, in meditative\r\nmood, of this noteworthy surmise: “Sir,” said he, “I do not imagine that\r\nall things will be made clear to us immediately after death, but that the\r\nways of Providence will be explained to us very gradually.” Be that as it\r\nmay, few could have been found more ready than the melancholic Johnson to\r\nagree that meanwhile, until the day star arise and the shadows flee away,\r\n\r\n    “The ways of Heaven are dark and intricate,\r\n    Puzzled in mazes, and perplexed with errors:\r\n    Our understanding traces them in vain,\r\n    Lost and bewildered in the fruitless search;\r\n    Nor sees with how much art the windings run,\r\n    Nor where the regular confusion ends.”\r\n\r\nIt was at a time of national and household tribulation, when darkness\r\nthat might be felt seemed to encompass altar and hearth, that Joseph\r\nde Maistre wrote to a friend in trouble: “Be it enough for us to know,\r\nthat for everything there is a reason with which we shall one day become\r\nacquainted; let us not weary ourselves with seeking out the why and\r\nthe wherefore, even when possibly they might be discerned.” He would\r\nhave his correspondent bear in mind that the epithet “very good” is a\r\nnecessary adjunct to “very great;” and that is sufficient. The inference\r\nis self-evident, that under the sway of the Being who combines in himself\r\nthose two qualities—the _très-bon_ and the _très-grand_—all the evils\r\nwe either suffer or witness must needs be acts of justice or means of\r\nreformation equally indispensable. In the declared love of God to man, M.\r\nde Maistre found a general solution of all the enigmas that can offend\r\n(_scandaliser_, in the New Testament sense of putting a stumbling-block\r\nin the way of) our ignorance. “Fixed to one little point of time and\r\nspace, we are insane enough to refer all to this point; and in so doing\r\nwe are at once blameworthy and absurd.” If De Maistre’s collation of the\r\n_très-bon_ with the _très-grand_ resembles the lines of Drummond’s hymn\r\nbeginning,\r\n\r\n    “O King, whose greatness none can comprehend,\r\n    Whose boundless goodness doth to all extend,”\r\n\r\nso is the scope of his argument at one with what follows:\r\n\r\n    “Here, where, as in a mirror, we but see\r\n    Shadows of shadows, atoms of Thy might,\r\n    Still owly-eyed when staring on Thy light.”\r\n\r\nWhat we call this life of men on earth, as Mr. Browning’s island-poet has\r\nit, is, as he finds much reason to conceive,\r\n\r\n    “Intended to be viewed eventually\r\n    As a great whole, not analysed to parts,\r\n    But each part having reference to all.”[26]\r\n\r\nPope’s well-worked line is of perpetual application,\r\n\r\n    “’Tis but a part we see, and not the whole.”\r\n\r\nSo is the avowal of the present laureate:\r\n\r\n                    “I see in part\r\n    That all, as in some work of art,\r\n    Is toil co-operant to an end.”\r\n\r\nTo us, as Sir Benjamin Brodie remarks, in one of his psychological\r\ndiscussions, the universe presents itself as an assemblage of\r\nheterogeneous phenomena, some of which we can reduce to laws of limited\r\noperation, while others stand by themselves, bearing no evident relation\r\nto anything besides. We may well, he thinks, suppose that there are\r\nin the universe beings of a superior intelligence, and possessed of a\r\ngreater range of observation, who are sufficiently “behind the scenes” to\r\nbe able to contemplate all the immense variety of material phenomena as\r\nthe result of one great general law. Their standpoint may enable them\r\nto see a Cosmos, a world of order, where to lower intelligences Chaos\r\nalone is discernible, a world comparatively without form and void, with\r\ndarkness upon the face of its deep. And as with the physical, so with the\r\nmetaphysical. As with the material, so with the moral.\r\n\r\n    “Experience, like a pale musician, holds\r\n    A dulcimer of patience in his hand;\r\n    Whence harmonies we cannot understand\r\n    Of God’s will in the worlds, the strain unfolds\r\n    In sad perplexèd minors....\r\n\r\n    “We murmur—‘Where is any certain tune\r\n    Of measured music, in such notes as these?’—\r\n    But angels leaning from their golden seat,\r\n    Are not so minded! their fine ear hath won\r\n    The issue of completed[27] cadences,—\r\n    And, smiling down the stars, they whisper—Sweet.”[28]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_RULING THE WAVES._\r\n\r\nPSALM cxiv. 1-5; ST. MARK iv. 39.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Israel went out of Egypt, it was under the guidance of One whose\r\nhand being mighty to save, the sea saw it, and fled; Jordan was driven\r\nback. “What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that\r\nthou wast driven back?” The trembling was at the presence of Him who hath\r\nplaced the sand for the bound of the sea, by a perpetual decree, that it\r\ncannot pass it; and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can\r\nthey not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it. The\r\ncommotion, the fleeing, the driving back, was at the bidding of Him\r\nwho, and who alone, can say to the sea, Thus far shalt thou come, and no\r\nfarther; and here shall thy proud waves be stayed.\r\n\r\nThe men of Galilee marvelled when, at the storm that once arose on their\r\nsea, and the ship was in jeopardy, there arose One who rebuked the winds\r\nand the sea; and there was a great calm. What manner of man was this,\r\nthat even the winds and the sea obeyed Him?\r\n\r\nWhat manner of man? Be it legend or history, the story of royal Cnut\r\non the seashore, forbidding, at his flatterers’ instigation, or by his\r\nown desire to rebuke their folly—forbidding the farther approach of the\r\nincoming tide, is pregnant with instruction on this head. The royal Dane\r\nmight be a man of men, but the surging waves were not obedient unto his\r\nvoice. King though he was, the tide was responseless as deaf adder to\r\nany charming of his, charmed he never so wisely, enjoined he never so\r\nstraitly. What manner of man, then, but the Son of man? What manner of\r\nking but the King of kings?\r\n\r\nThe Dane might have enforced the lesson on his parasites by such a strain\r\nas that of a defeated monarch in Shakspeare:—\r\n\r\n                            “Farewell king!\r\n    Cover your heads, and mock not flesh and blood\r\n    With solemn reverence; throw away respect,\r\n    Tradition, form, and ceremonious duty,\r\n    For you have but mistook me all this while:\r\n    I live with bread, like you, feel want, taste grief,\r\n    Need friends:—subjected thus,\r\n    How can you say to me I am a king?”\r\n\r\nA king, that is, in _their_ sense of right Divine, and Divine extent.\r\nSo with poor, mad, discrowned Lear, drenched in that terrible storm\r\non the heath, and remembering soft speeches of cozening courtiership,\r\nonly of yesterday too. “When the rain came to wet me, and the wind to\r\nmake me chatter; when the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there\r\nI found them, there I smelt them out. Go to, they are not men of their\r\nwords: they told me I was everything; ’tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.”\r\nMark, again, from the opening scene of the “Tempest,” the rough, blunt,\r\nuncivil words with which the boatswain cuts short the addresses of his\r\nroyal passengers:—\r\n\r\n    “Hence! What care these roarers [the waves] for the name of\r\n    king? To cabin: silence: trouble us not.\r\n\r\n    “_Gonzalo._ Good; yet remember whom thou hast aboard.\r\n\r\n    “_Boatswain._ None that I love more than myself. You are a\r\n    counsellor; if you can command these elements to a silence,\r\n    and work the peace of the present [instant], we will not hand\r\n    a rope more: use your authority. If you cannot, give thanks\r\n    you have lived so long, and make yourself ready in your cabin\r\n    for the mischance of the hour, if so it hap. Cheerily, good\r\n    hearts.—Out of our way, I say!”\r\n\r\nOf Antiochus Epiphanes, and his pride that had a fall, it is written in\r\nthe book of Maccabees: “And thus he that a little afore thought he _might\r\ncommand the waves of the sea_ (so proud was he beyond the condition of\r\nman), and weigh the high mountains in a balance, was now cast on the\r\nground.”\r\n\r\nAn elder king than Cnut, and not a wiser, not only lashed the winds that\r\nblew contrary to his will, but bound the sea with fetters, after a sort:\r\n\r\n    “Ipsum compedibus qui vinxerat Ennosigæum.”\r\n\r\nMuch good it did him: witness his return from his great expedition,\r\nin a poor skiff, wind-tossed across waves red with the blood of his\r\nslaughtered host, _cruentis fluctibus_. The stars in their courses\r\nonce fought against Sisera, and the fettered waves were little more\r\npropitious to speed the fortunes of Xerxes. He might have spared his\r\nchains. At any rate he lost his army. Archdeacon Hare practically applied\r\nthe extravagance of the Great King, as they of Persia were styled, in\r\ndesignating the present (or, rather, what was to him the present) as an\r\nage when men will scoff at the madness of Xerxes, yet themselves try to\r\nfling their chains over the ever-rolling, irrepressible ocean of thought;\r\nnay, they will scoop out a mimic sea in their pleasure-ground, he goes\r\non to say, and make it ripple and bubble, and spout up prettily into the\r\nair, and then fancy that they are taming the Atlantic; which, however,\r\nkeeps advancing upon them, until it sweeps them away with their toys.\r\n\r\nIt is edifying to read in the Diary of Mr. Pepys how, one July afternoon,\r\nsoon after the king had come back to enjoy his own again, that gentleman\r\nwent upon the river, but had to put ashore and shelter himself from the\r\nrain that rained so hard; during which time came by the king in his\r\nbarge, going down towards the Downs to meet the queen: “But methought it\r\nlessened my esteem of a king, that he should not be able to command the\r\nrain.”\r\n\r\nInstructive, too, is the tenor of the legend of King Robert of Sicily,\r\nwhich has been so attractively treated in prose by Leigh Hunt, in his\r\nJar of Honey from Mount Hybla, and in verse by Professor Longfellow, in\r\nhis Tales of a Wayside Inn. There we read how the king with his nobles\r\nproudly sat at vespers, on St. John’s Eve, and heard the priests chant\r\nthe Magnificat:—\r\n\r\n    “And, as he listened, o’er and o’er again\r\n    Repeated, like a burden or refrain,\r\n    He caught the words, ‘_Deposuit potentes_\r\n    _De sede, et exaltavit humiles_;’\r\n    And slowly lifting up his kingly head,\r\n    He to a learned clerk beside him said,\r\n    ‘What mean these words?’ The clerk made answer meet,\r\n    ‘He hath put down the mighty from their seat,\r\n    And hath exalted them of low degree.’\r\n    Thereat King Robert muttered scornfully,\r\n    ’Tis well that such seditious words are sung\r\n    Only by priests, and in the Latin tongue;\r\n    For unto priests and people be it known\r\n    There is no power can push me from my throne!’”\r\n\r\nThe sequel teaches him a different lesson, which he learns by (and lays\r\nto) heart.\r\n\r\nIn those days, however, if any order of men might, or did, claim\r\nauthority over such turbulent subject-matter as the sea, it was not\r\nkings, but priests. Ecclesiastical history relates the calamitous\r\nvisitation of earthquake and inundations by which Epidaurus must once,\r\nand for ever, have been overwhelmed, had not the prudent citizens placed\r\nSt. Hilarion, an Egyptian monk, on the beach. “He made the sign of the\r\ncross; the mountain-wave stopped, bowed, and returned.” One’s respect\r\nfor the great qualities of the fearless Akbah, traversing the wilds of\r\nAfrica, and at length penetrating to the verge of the Atlantic, is not\r\nlessened by what Gibbon relates of him:—that his career, though not his\r\nzeal, being checked by the prospect of a boundless ocean, Akbah spurred\r\nhis horse into the waves, and raising his eyes to heaven, exclaimed\r\nwith the tone of a fanatic, “Great God, if my course were not stopped\r\nby this sea, I would still go on, to the unknown kingdoms of the West,\r\npreaching the unity of Thy holy name.” And the picture reminds us of\r\nanother, some eight centuries later, when Constantinople was besieged and\r\ntaken by Mahomet II., who, while his ships were engaged against those of\r\nthe Genoese, sat on horseback on the beach, to encourage by voice and\r\npresence the valour of the faithful: “The passions of his soul, and even\r\nthe gestures of his body, seemed to imitate the action of the combatants;\r\nand, as if he had been the lord of nature, he spurred his horse with\r\na fearless and impotent effort into the sea.” Sir Archibald Alison\r\nmoralises on the spectacle of Napoleon, in 1804, reviewing, or intending\r\nto review, the naval force by which he designed to crush the British\r\npower: the flotilla being tempest-tost when it hove in sight, and several\r\nvessels stranded—an event “destined to teach the French Emperor, like\r\nCanute the Dane, that there were bounds to his power, and that his might\r\nwas limited to the element on which his army stood.” The sea—_c’est autre\r\nchose_.\r\n\r\nIt is of Tiberius, absolute master of the vastest, richest empire ever\r\nseen under the sun, that an eminent French preacher is treating when\r\nhe says that an adulatory senator kept repeating to him in every tone\r\nand accent that his authority was without bounds. Tiberius would fain\r\nhave believed the assurance, if the illusion had been possible,—if\r\nhe had not felt himself at every instant _heurté contre une barrière\r\ninfranchissable_. The emperor’s flatterers had forgotten, for one thing,\r\nto secure a peremptory decree against the inconvenient limitation called\r\ntime. His days were numbered. And in vain Tiberius essayed to trick and\r\nelude death, and dissembled with himself as to the stubborn fact of its\r\nresistless advance.\r\n\r\nKings, great nobles, and the like, as a popular essayist observes, have\r\nbeen known, even to the close of life, to violently curse and swear, if\r\nthings went against them; going the length of stamping and blaspheming\r\neven at wind and rain, and branches of trees and plashes of mud, for\r\ninsubordination and disrespect of persons. A popular novelist, again,\r\nhaving to describe a fashionable wedding in the country on a portentously\r\nwet and stormy day, makes the Lisford beadle, “who was a sound Tory of\r\nthe old school,” almost wonder that the heavens themselves should be\r\naudacious enough to wet the uncovered head of the lord of Jocelyn’s Rock.\r\n“But it went on raining nevertheless.” It was in no such spirit that John\r\nBunyan once was all but resolved on putting to the test the reality of\r\nhis faith, by commanding some water puddles to be dry.\r\n\r\nMr. Carlyle made a picturesque application of the royal Dane’s injunction\r\nto the waves, in his survey of the advancing tide of the French\r\nRevolution—grim host marching on, the black-browed Marseillese in the\r\nvan, with hum and murmur, far-heard; like the ocean-tide, “drawn up,\r\nas if by Luna and Influences, from the great deep of waters, they roll\r\ngleaming on; no king, Canute or Louis, can bid them roll back.” To quite\r\nanother effect is Judge Haliburton’s application of the incident, in his\r\npanegyric on the capabilities of the Southampton docks. It was here, he\r\nsays, that Cnut sat in his arm-chair, to show his courtiers (after he\r\ngave up drinking and murder) that though he was a mighty prince, he could\r\nnot control the sea. “Well, what Canute could not do, your dock company\r\nhas accomplished. It has actually said to the sea, ‘Thus far shalt thou\r\ngo, and no farther:’ and the waves have obeyed the mandate.”\r\n\r\nBy poetical licence a Cornish poet of the present day ascribes to his\r\nrock-bound coast a _ne plus ultra_ control over an ever-aggressive sea:\r\nhe pictures the embattled advance of the waves, and their discomfiture\r\nand retreat:\r\n\r\n    “They come—they mount—they charge in vain.\r\n    Thus far, incalculable main;\r\n    No more! Thine hosts have not o’erthrown\r\n    The lichen on the barrier stone.\r\n    Have the rocks faith that thus they stand,\r\n    Unmoved, a grim and stately band,\r\n    And look, like warriors tried and brave,\r\n    Stern, silent, reckless, o’er the wave?”\r\n\r\nOne, and one alone, is veritably the ruler of the waves. When the floods\r\nare risen, when the floods have lift up their voice, and lift up their\r\nwaves, to Him only it pertaineth to still their tumultuous clamour, and\r\nto level their aspiring crests. The waves of the sea are mighty, and rage\r\nhorribly; yet the Lord, who dwelleth on high, is mightier. “O Lord God of\r\nhosts, who is like unto Thee?... Thou rulest the raging of the sea: Thou\r\nstillest the waves thereof when they arise.”\r\n\r\nWith a moral application we conclude, borrowed from one whose was ever\r\nthe pen of a ready writer to point a moral. Some dream, says Cowper, that\r\n\r\n        ... “they can silence when they will\r\n    The storm of passion, and say, ‘Peace, be still:’\r\n    But ‘Thus far and no farther,’ when addressed\r\n    To the wild wave, or wilder human breast,\r\n    Implies authority that never can,\r\n    That never ought to be the lot of man.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_IN DEADLY PERIL UNAWARES._\r\n\r\n1 SAMUEL xxvi. 8-25.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoundly the stalwart king of Israel slept within the trench, while David\r\nand Abishai gazed on him by stealth in the night-watches—his spear stuck\r\nin the ground at his bolster, and Abner and the people lying round about\r\nhim. Abishai was for smiting him with the spear at once, promising that\r\nonce should be quite enough. Could David hesitate? Was it not a special\r\nProvidence? Had not God delivered his enemy into his hand? Let but David\r\ngive the word, the look, the nod, and Abishai would at one fell swoop\r\nsend Saul to his account, with all his imperfections on his head. “Now,\r\ntherefore, let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear, even to the\r\nearth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.” But David was\r\ninflexible in repudiating the regicide. Not for him was it to stretch\r\nforth a hand against the Lord’s anointed. So Saul slept on, and the\r\nshadow of death passed away. Unaware of the peril that had approached\r\nhim, his awaking was an ordinary awaking. But, to convict the watchers\r\nof unwatchfulness, if not to convince the king of a narrow escape and a\r\ngenerous foe, David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul’s\r\nbolster; and he and his companion gat them away unperceived—for no man\r\nsaw it, nor knew it, neither awaked; for they were all asleep; because\r\na deep sleep from the Lord was fallen upon them. Anon David roused the\r\nhost with the story of that narrow escape, charging Abner with criminal\r\nneglect worthy of death. And as he recited the story, Saul was touched;\r\nand there was emotion in his voice and in his words when he felt what the\r\nperil had been, and knew whom he had to thank for its harmless issue.\r\n\r\nHad we eyes sharp enough, observes Cowper in a letter to Hayley, we\r\nshould see the arrows of death flying in all directions, and account\r\nit a wonder that we and our friends escape them but a single day.\r\nMany years previously the poet had written to the same effect to\r\nUnwin,—that could we see at a glance of the eye what is passing every\r\nday upon all the roads in the kingdom, we should indeed find reason\r\nto be thankful for journeys performed in safety, and for deliverance\r\nfrom dangers we are not perhaps even permitted to see. “When in some of\r\nthe high southern latitudes, and in a dark tempestuous night, a flash\r\nof lightning discovered to Captain Cook a vessel which glanced along\r\nclose by his side, and which but for the lightning he must have run\r\nfoul of, both the danger and the transient light that showed it were\r\nundoubtedly designed,” as Cowper is devoutly convinced, “to convey to\r\nhim this wholesome instruction, that a particular Providence attended\r\nhim, and that he was not only preserved from evils of which he had\r\nnotice, but from many more of which he had no information or even the\r\nleast suspicion.” It is noticeable, as Mr. de Quincey points out, that\r\na danger which approaches, but wheels away—which threatens, but finally\r\nforbears to strike—is more interesting by much on a distant retrospect\r\nthan the danger which accomplishes its mission. “The Alpine precipice,\r\ndown which many pilgrims have fallen, is passed without much attention;\r\nbut that precipice, within one inch of which a traveller has passed\r\nunconsciously in the dark, first tracing his peril along the snowy margin\r\non the next morning, becomes invested with an attraction of horror for\r\nall who hear the story.” In another of his books, and the most celebrated\r\nof them all, the same impassioned master of English prose, recites the\r\nthoughts that arose within him, at a crisis in his youthful life, on the\r\nsuggestive opening of that beautiful collect, “Lighten our darkness,\r\nwe beseech thee, O Lord!” in which the great shadows of night are made\r\nsymbolically significant—those great powers, night and darkness, that\r\nbelong to aboriginal chaos, being made representative of the perils that,\r\nunseen, continually menace poor afflicted human nature. “With deepest\r\nsympathy I accompanied the prayer against the perils of darkness,—perils\r\nthat I seemed to see, in the ambush of midnight solitude, brooding\r\naround the beds of sleeping nations; perils from even worse forms of\r\ndarkness shrouded within the recesses of blind human hearts; perils from\r\ntemptations weaving unseen snares for our footing.” As Marcello has it,\r\nin Beddoes’ tragedy,\r\n\r\n    “Each minute of man’s safety he does walk\r\n    A bridge, no thicker than his frozen breath,\r\n    O’er a precipitous and craggy danger\r\n    Yawning to death!”\r\n\r\nWith admirable subtlety and suggestiveness, Mr. Hawthorne illustrates\r\nthis subject in that _fantasiestück_ of his, called “David Swan.” A young\r\nman of that name falls asleep on the roadside, of a summer’s day, and\r\n_we_ see, what he sees not, nor dreams of happening to him, a series of\r\nincidents that go near to alter the current of his being, and very near,\r\nin one instance, to stop altogether its earthly course. When he awakes\r\nfrom that sound sleep, and hies him cheerily homeward, he knows not,\r\nnor ever will know, in this world at least, that while he slumbered, all\r\nin one brief hour, wealth was all but made over to him by one heirless\r\npasser-by, and death all but dealt him by two reckless ruffians. They\r\nwere interrupted, and left him, and he never was to know of the narrow\r\nescape. The moral of the fantasy is, that sleeping or waking, we hear\r\nnot the airy footsteps of the strange things that almost happen. And the\r\nmoralist’s query ensues, Does it not argue a superintending Providence,\r\nthat while viewless and unexpected events thrust themselves continually\r\nathwart our path, there should still be regularity enough in mortal life\r\nto render foresight even partially available?\r\n\r\nThe moral of “David Swan” is implicitly conveyed in that passage in\r\n“Waverley” which relates Colonel Gardiner’s unconscious escape from the\r\nraised and pointed weapon of the Highlander, Callum Beg. An incident\r\nthat appeals to his superstition makes the intending slayer drop his\r\npiece; and “Colonel Gardiner,” we read, “unconscious of the danger he had\r\nescaped, turned his horse round, and rode slowly back to the front of his\r\nregiment.”\r\n\r\nSo with Mrs. Hilyard, in “Salem Chapel,” on the evening of the secret\r\ninterview upon the chapel steps. A hidden witness there is of that\r\ninterview, who, however, sees not the gesture of her companion which\r\nbodes, and almost involves, a fatal, a murderous issue. “But even Mrs.\r\nHilyard herself never knew how near, how very near, she was at that\r\nmoment to the unseen world.”\r\n\r\nOr glance, again, at the Azteca, in Southey’s “Madoc,” gliding like a\r\nsnake to where Caradoc lay sleeping—all unconscious of peril, as happy,\r\nand happily unconscious, David Swan:—\r\n\r\n    “Sweetly slept he, and pleasant were his dreams\r\n    Of Britain, and the blue-eyed maid he loved.\r\n    The Azteca stood over him; he knew\r\n    His victim, and the power of vengeance gave\r\n    Malignant joy. Once hast thou ’scaped my arm;\r\n    But what shall save thee now? the Tiger thought,\r\n    Exulting, and he raised his spear to strike.\r\n    That instant, o’er the Briton’s unseen harp\r\n    The gale of morning passed, and swept its strings\r\n    Into so sweet a harmony, that sure\r\n    It seemed no earthly tune. The savage man\r\n    Suspends his stroke; he looks astonished round;\r\n    No human hand is near:—and hark! again\r\n    The aërial music swells and dies away.\r\n    Then first the heart of Tialala felt fear:\r\n    He thought that some protecting spirit watched\r\n    Beside the stranger, and, abashed, withdrew.”\r\n\r\nTo Cremona went together, in seeming amity, the Emperor Sigismund and\r\nPope John XXIII., and there an incident had nearly taken place, which,\r\nas the historian of Latin Christianity says, might, by preventing the\r\nCouncil of Constance, have changed the fortunes of the world. Gabrino\r\nFondoli, who from podestâ had become tyrant of Cremona, “entertained his\r\ndistinguished guests with sumptuous hospitality. He led them up the lofty\r\ntower to survey the rich and spacious plains of Lombardy. On his deathbed\r\nFondoli confessed the sin, of which he deeply repented, that he resisted\r\nthe temptation, and had not hurled pope and emperor down, and so secured\r\nhimself an immortal name.” Pope and emperor on the tower-top were as\r\nlittle inclined to suspect how closely the shadow of death was then and\r\nthere overshadowing them, as they would have been able to comprehend the\r\nultimate repentance of the intending murderer, not for having intended\r\nmurder, but for having not carried his intention out.\r\n\r\nIt is one of Young’s night thoughts that “the farthest from the fear,\r\nare often nearest to the stroke of fate.” Often the stroke menaces them\r\nunawares, but after all is not dealt; and to the last they are unaware\r\nthat on such a day, and at such a minute, there was but a step between\r\nthem and death.\r\n\r\n_Quid quisque vitet_, says Horace, _nunquam homini satis cautum est, in\r\nhoras_. The ignorance of what is impending is bliss, in a certain sense.\r\nJust as\r\n\r\n    “The kid from the pen, and the lamb from the fold,\r\n    Unmoved may the blade of the butcher behold;\r\n    They dream not—ah, happier they!—that the knife,\r\n    Though uplifted, can menace their innocent life.\r\n    It falls;—the frail thread of their being is riven;\r\n    They dread not, suspect not, the blow till ’tis given.”\r\n\r\n_Mais qu’il me soit permis de ne le savoir pas_, is the wish of some in\r\nregard even of escaped peril.\r\n\r\nScott vividly illustrates in “Rokeby” the position of unconscious and\r\ntherefore unconcerned borderers on the grave; it is where Bertram creeps\r\non hands and knees through the spreading birch and hazels, and takes aim\r\nat Redmond, and twice Matilda comes between the carabine and Redmond’s\r\nbreast, “just ere the spring his finger pressed;” and the interruption of\r\nGuy Denzil’s approach makes the ruffian retire, _rê infectâ_:\r\n\r\n    “They whom dark Bertram, in his wrath,\r\n    Doomed to captivity or death,\r\n    Their thoughts to one sad subject lent,\r\n    Saw not nor heard the ambushment.\r\n    Heedless and unconcerned they sate,\r\n    While on the very verge of fate;\r\n    Heedless and unconcerned remained,\r\n    When Heaven the murderer’s arm restrained;\r\n    As ships drift darkling down the tide,\r\n    Nor see the shelves o’er which they glide.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_NO LEISURE._\r\n\r\nST. MARK vi. 31.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat must have been a busy time with the apostles, careful and troubled\r\nabout many things, cumbered with much serving, worn with many anxieties,\r\nand kept in unrest by continual demands on their services, when the\r\nDivine Master—knowing their frame and remembering that they were\r\ndust—bade them come by themselves “apart into a desert place, and rest a\r\nwhile; for there were many coming and going, and they had _no leisure_ so\r\nmuch as to eat.”\r\n\r\nOur own age has been rightly described as one of stimulus and high\r\npressure: we live as it were our lives out fast; effect is everything;\r\nresults produced at once; something to show, and something that may\r\n_tell_. “The folio of patient years is replaced by the pamphlet that\r\nstirs men’s curiosity to-day, and to-morrow is forgotten.” Or as an\r\neminent reviewer puts it—writing to the same effect as the eminent divine\r\njust quoted—without grudging to contemporary productions the applause\r\nwhich they receive, or the interest which they excite, thoughtful minds\r\ncannot see them with complacency obscuring by their brilliance, or\r\nperhaps their “glare,” the more temperate and wholesome light of the\r\nelder classics of our land. “At no moment in the intellectual progress\r\nof England has repose ever been more needful, if the literature of the\r\npresent century be to take its place among its great antecessors.” For\r\nwant of repose our prose is declared on the same authority to be growing\r\nturgid, our verse empty or inflated; and as a good cooling regimen\r\nis required to correct these exorbitances, nothing would rejoice our\r\ncensor more than to be assured, on the credit of sound publishers’\r\nstatistics, that the number of new books was diminishing, while that of\r\nre-editions of old books was on the increase. Dr. Arnold, we are told,\r\nonce preached a sermon to the boys at Rugby against taking in the monthly\r\nnumbers of “Nicholas Nickleby,” by way of protest against systematic and\r\nuninterrupted excitement. “Society keeps up as much excitement as it can.\r\nIt wants its new number of something to appear incessantly. There is no\r\nrest or repose, and one subject of thought succeeds another faster than\r\nwave succeeds wave.” A rather ironical apology for dull sermons sets up\r\nat least this plea in their behalf: that so easy is it for a man who\r\nlives in such a society never to be alone with himself, that a compulsory\r\nhalf-hour of quietude at a wakeful time of the day, in a place which\r\nrecalls to him the most solemn thoughts, is no slight advantage.\r\n\r\nLa Bruyère, two centuries ago, complained of French society in his day,\r\nthat there was no getting any one to abide quietly at home, and there in\r\npatience possess his soul, and make sure to himself that he had one. All\r\nwas hurry and flurry. Not to be excitedly busy was to be idle. But that\r\nthe philosopher denied. A wise man turns his leisure to account. He is\r\nnot idle who devotes his leisure to tranquil meditation, and converse\r\nand reading. Rather is this a species of work—at any rate a means for\r\nworking with fresh energy and better effect when the working hour comes\r\nround again. There is such a thing as what Wordsworth wisely calls a wise\r\npassiveness.\r\n\r\nChateaubriand, again, more than a century afterwards, complained—not\r\nindeed of Frenchmen alone, but of all men—that all was done\r\nhelter-skelter and in haste, post-haste; that amid this din and\r\ndistraction of coming and going there was no leisure so much as to eat;\r\nor that if men did set about a meal, there was no such thing as sitting\r\ndown to it, but it was eaten by them with their loins girded, their shoes\r\non their feet, and their staff in their hand—eaten in haste, as was the\r\nJewish passover.\r\n\r\nThe most eminent political economist of our day owns himself to be “not\r\ncharmed” with the ideal of life held out by those who think that the\r\nnormal state of human beings is that of struggling to get on; that the\r\ntrampling, crushing, elbowing, and treading on one another’s heels,\r\nwhich form the existing type of social life, are the most desirable\r\nlot of human kind, or anything but the disagreeable symptoms of one of\r\nthe phases of industrial progress. The town, complains one of the most\r\nthoughtful and influential of latter-day divines,—the town, with its\r\nfever and its excitements, and its collision of mind with mind, has\r\nspread over the country, and there is no country, scarcely home. “To men\r\nwho traverse England in a few hours, and spend only a portion of the\r\nyear in one place, home is becoming a vocable of past ages.” He echoes\r\nWordsworth’s lament that\r\n\r\n    “Plain living and high thinking are no more;”\r\n\r\nand in another place he declares our want to be the vision of a calmer\r\nand simpler beauty, to tranquillise us in the midst of artificial tastes,\r\nand the draught of a purer spring to cool the flame of our excited life.\r\nIt is many years ago since the most genial of essayists avowed his\r\npreference for “coaching it,” and could have been well content to live\r\nupon the road, in those roomy antiques, instead of getting on at the\r\npresent rate, and being impatient to arrive at some town, only perhaps\r\nto be equally restless when arrived there. Not that he was insensible\r\nto the pleasure of driving fast—stirring the blood as it does, and\r\ngiving a sense of power; but he complained that everything was getting a\r\nlittle too hasty and business-like, “as though we were to be eternally\r\ngetting on, and never realizing anything but fidget and money—the means\r\ninstead of the end.” A distinction is duly recognised between haste and\r\nhurry—hurry adding to rapidity the element of painful confusion; but\r\nin the case of ordinary people, as Dr. Boyd observes, haste generally\r\nimplies hurry, and very strenuously he dilates on “what a horrible thing”\r\nit must be to go through life in a hurry. The self-styled country parson\r\nmade a name (“letters four do make that name”) by his “Recreations.”\r\nAnd he has since then maintained its popularity by a series of\r\n“Leisure Hours.” In his essay concerning Hurry and Leisure he avows\r\nhis utter contempt for the idler—the loafer, as Yankees term him—who\r\nnever does anything, whose idle hands are always in his idle pockets,\r\nand who is always sauntering to and fro. Leisure, we are reminded,\r\nis the intermission of labour—the blink of idleness in the life of a\r\nhard-working man; and it is only in the case of such a man that leisure\r\nis allowed to be dignified, commendable, or enjoyable. “But to him it\r\nis all these, and more. Let us not be ever driving on. The machinery,\r\nphysical and mental, will not stand it.” Only in leisure, it is further\r\ncontended, will the human mind yield many of its best products. Calm\r\nviews, sound thoughts, healthful feelings, do not originate in a hurry or\r\na fever.\r\n\r\nIt was in wistful remembrance of the silence in heaven for the space\r\nof half an hour, as recorded by the Seer of Patmos, that Mrs. Browning\r\npenned a sonnet which expressed a prayer, suggestive in its earnestness\r\nand of wide application,\r\n\r\n    “Vouchsafe us such a half-hour’s hush alone,\r\n    In compensation for our stormy years!”\r\n\r\nNever to be forgotten amid the tranquillising sweets of leisure hours,\r\nwith healing on their wings, is the serene solemnity of that silent\r\nhalf-hour.\r\n\r\nProfessor Longfellow, in one of his earliest works, proclaimed to his\r\ncountrymen as the great want of the national character, that of the\r\n“dignity of repose.” “We seem,” he said, “to live in the midst of a\r\nbattle—there is such a din, such a hurrying to and fro. In the streets\r\nof a crowded city it is difficult to walk slowly. You feel the rushing\r\nof the crowd, and rush with it onward. In the press of our life, it is\r\ndifficult to be calm. In this stress of wind and tide, all professions\r\nseem to drag their anchors, and are swept out into the main.” The\r\nfollowing stanza is so thoroughly conceived in the spirit and expressed\r\nin the style of the same author—the author of the “Psalm of Life”—that\r\nfew readers might have hesitated to attribute it to him, were it not\r\nknown to be from one of the “Palm Leaves” of Lord Houghton, who, a\r\nquarter of a century ago, as Richard Monckton Milnes, after contrasting\r\nthe din, and stir, and turmoil of the West with the reposeful air of the\r\nEast, counselled the poet of the West to wander eastward now and then:\r\n\r\n    “There the calm of life comparing\r\n      With his Europe’s busy fate,\r\n    Let him gladly homeward faring,\r\n      Learn to labour and to wait.”\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps the most gifted of American writers of fiction to whom we\r\nowe the avowal, that were he to adopt a pet idea, as so many people do,\r\nand fondle it in his embraces to the exclusion of all others, it would be\r\nthat the great want which mankind labours under at this present period\r\nis—sleep. The world, he urges, should recline its vast head on the first\r\nconvenient pillow, and take a prolonged nap. It has gone distracted,\r\non his showing, through a morbid activity, and while preternaturally\r\nwide awake, is nevertheless tormented by visions that seem real to it\r\nnow, but would assume their true aspect and character were all things\r\nonce set right by an interval of sound repose. This he declares to be\r\nthe only method of getting rid of old delusions and of avoiding new\r\nones—of restoring to us the simple perception of what is right, and the\r\nsingle-hearted desire to achieve it, both of which have long been lost\r\nin consequence of this weary activity of brain and torpor or passion\r\nof the heart that now afflict the universe. “Stimulants, the only mode\r\nof treatment hitherto attempted, cannot quell the disease; they do but\r\nheighten the delirium.” Sleep, therefore, is the panacea he prescribes\r\nfor the physical and metaphysical regeneration of our race, so that it\r\nmay in due time awake, as an infant out of dewy slumber.\r\n\r\nTo the like effect protests an able essayist of our day against\r\ntendencies to overrate the endless facilities of speedy locomotion now\r\nenjoyed, as if they were a boon without a drawback; and he professes not\r\nto regard as particularly attractive or elevating the sight of mankind\r\nscouring and bustling endlessly hither and thither over the face of the\r\nearth, like eager, energetic ants, with little bits of straw or other\r\nrubbish packed on their heads. Ought we not rather, it is asked, to look\r\non tranquillity, and equilibrium, and regularity, as the normal condition\r\nof things? and in the thousand encomiums which are poured forth upon\r\nsteam and speed, do we often take into account the waste and havoc which\r\nthey make in “plain living”—how they practically shorten the days of a\r\nman?\r\n\r\nThe haste and hurry of modern English civilization, it has been elsewhere\r\nobserved, ever increasing and carrying us more impetuously forward, tend\r\nto deaden all capacity for simpler enjoyments, and all sense of the worth\r\nof a tranquil life on which the eyes of all the world are not fixed. And\r\nwhenever, as a reflective discourser remarks, people set their heads to\r\nconstant work, we may be perfectly certain that they are losing more than\r\nthey gain, and are sinking in the scale at once of meditative and social\r\nbeings. The accomplished author of an essay on Leisure—the cultivation of\r\nwhich as an art is thought to be in danger of dying out amongst us—says\r\nof that activity which never relaxes sufficiently to allow time for a\r\ncalm and more or less passive contemplation of life as a whole, that it\r\nis “apt to degenerate into mere hand-to-mouth fussiness or drudgery,\r\nand can be justified only by necessity.” The very repose of leisure is\r\naccordingly pronounced a by no means purely selfish enjoyment—it being\r\none of the most communicable, nay, contagious, of pleasures; for there\r\nare people, we are reminded, whose company is as restful as sleep, in\r\nwhose presence hurry seems like a bad dream when it is past, and whom\r\none leaves with a sense of refreshment and renewed energy such as is\r\nproduced by a good night’s rest. And this writer contends that to afford\r\nsuch refreshment to others may often be turning time to better account\r\nthan to crowd it with self-chosen business. Not that the fact is not\r\nduly insisted upon that too little work is as fatal as too much to that\r\nlightness and alacrity of spirit which are needed for the conversion of\r\nspare time into hours of leisure worthy to be so called. Some natures,\r\nindeed, and they are of a high order, sometimes of the highest, find one\r\nleisure hour at a time as much as they can away with, and anon\r\n\r\n      “The hour of rest is gone,\r\n    And urgent voices round them cry,\r\n      ‘Ho, lingerer, hasten on!’\r\n\r\n    “And has the soul, then, only gained,\r\n      From this brief time of ease,\r\n    A moment’s rest, when overstrained,\r\n      One hurried glimpse of peace?”\r\n\r\nNay something better and more abiding than that.\r\n\r\nBut to conclude. The notion, as expounded by an essayist on “Short\r\nCuts,” that if a thing is to be done at all, “then ’twere well it were\r\ndone quickly,” admirable as it may be on the Exchange, is justly said\r\nto rub the delicacy and bloom off life when it is made the ruling maxim\r\nin all other relations and positions: a life with leisure hours in it\r\nfor watching and examining all that we pass being a much more enviable\r\nand rational lot than a swift rushing from one goal to another, from one\r\nsort of fame or power or opulence to another and more remote. When the\r\nambitious hero in Sir Henry Taylor’s dramatic poem declares in the storm\r\nand stress of his career,\r\n\r\n    “We have not time to mourn,”\r\n\r\n“The worse for us!” is his good counsellor’s rejoinder:\r\n\r\n    “_He that lacks time to mourn lacks time to mend._\r\n    _Eternity mourns that._ ’Tis an ill cure\r\n    For life’s worst ills, to have no time to feel them.\r\n    Where sorrow’s held intrusive and turn’d out,\r\n    There wisdom will not enter, nor true power,\r\n    Nor aught that dignifies humanity.\r\n    Yet such the barrenness of busy life!\r\n    From shelf to shelf Ambition clambers up\r\n    To reach the naked’st pinnacle of all,\r\n    While Magnanimity, absolved from toil,\r\n    Reposes self-included at the base.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A PROPHYLACTIC KNIFE TO THE THROAT._\r\n\r\nPROVERBS xxiii. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nKing Solomon’s discreet counsel to him that feasts with royalty, to\r\nput a knife to his throat, if he be a man given to appetite, may be\r\nadvantageously enlarged in its application to diners-out, or for the\r\nmatter of that, to diners at home, all and sundry. Sitting to eat with a\r\nruler, the guest is admonished to consider diligently what is before him;\r\nand at the same time to be not desirous of the great man’s dainties, for\r\nthey are deceitful meat. Any and every man given to appetite will do well\r\nto chew the cud of this bitter fancy; and the prophylactic application of\r\na knife to the throat, forbidding rash ingress and intemperate speed of\r\nswallow, is wholesome for all estates and degrees of men among us, and\r\nmight beneficially be a standing order for all times.\r\n\r\nAdam Smith, in his “Theory of the Moral Sentiments,” calls it “indecent”\r\nto express any strong degree of those passions which arise from a certain\r\nsituation or disposition of the body; because the company, not being\r\nin the same disposition, cannot be expected to sympathize with them;\r\nand he mentions violent hunger as being, though upon many occasions\r\nnot only natural, but unavoidable, yet “always indecent; and to eat\r\nvoraciously is universally regarded as a piece of ill manners.” There\r\nis, however, he allows, some degree of sympathy, even with hunger, and\r\nwe may add, even on the part of a ruler at whose table sits the man\r\ngiven to appetite. Lewis the Fourteenth, himself a gourmand, and, which\r\nis different, an enormous eater, liked to see a dinner guest disposing\r\nwholesale of the royal cates, if only by way of keeping himself in\r\ncountenance, while achieving the like result. Royalty has, indeed, again\r\nand again been addicted to surfeiting, and sometimes of a memorably\r\nfatal sort. Alexander Jannæus died of gluttony, during the siege of\r\nRagaba. Soliman, the seventh khalif of the race of the Ommiyades, died\r\nof a surfeit at Chalcis, in Syria, while preparing to lead an army to\r\nConstantinople.[29] Of the emperor Jovian, we read in Gibbon, that one\r\nnight, at the obscure town Dadastana, after indulging himself with a\r\nredundant supper, he retired to rest, and was next morning found dead\r\nin his bed—an event ascribed by some, though not by all, to the quality\r\nof the mushrooms, _plus_ the quantity of wine, which he had swallowed\r\nin the evening. The same historian rather more than suspects that the\r\nmortal disease of Athanaric the Goth “was contracted amidst the pleasures\r\nof the imperial banquets,” by Theodosius provided. Pope Benedict XI.\r\nis said to have died of a surfeit of fruit—some beautiful fresh figs,\r\nof which he was very fond, being offered to him in a silver basin by a\r\nveiled novice, as if from the abbess of the convent of St. Petronilla,\r\nin Perugia: “The pope, not suspecting a gift from such a hand, ate them\r\neagerly, and without having them previously tasted.” That he died of\r\npoison, few in that age, as Milman says, would venture to doubt, but\r\nthe poisoning power of arrears of undigested food has never been quite\r\nrated at its full value. The same hesitation between fruit surfeit and\r\npoison, obtains in the case of King John, whose death, by one account\r\ndue to the fatal drug administered by a Cistercian monk, by another is\r\nattributed to an intemperate indulgence at supper in fruit and new cider.\r\nThe Emperor Frederick III. contracted his last illness, some say, by a\r\nsurfeit of melons. And is there not, in the case of our Henry I., what\r\nhas been called that tale of royal excess so concisely and pathetically\r\ntold in nursery history? “He never smiled again, and died of a surfeit of\r\nlampreys.” The _regicide_ lampreys, Moore calls them in one place; and\r\nin another, after citing Hume’s remark on them, as “a food which always\r\nagreed better with his [Henry’s] palate than his constitution,” a dish so\r\nindigestible, that a late novelist, at the end of his book, could imagine\r\nno more summary mode of getting rid of all his heroes and heroines\r\nthan by a hearty supper of stewed lampreys. In yet another the same\r\nsquib-writer has a cruel simile, “just as honest King Stephen his beaver\r\nmight doff to the fishes that carried his kind uncle off.” To a surfeit\r\nof red herrings is ascribed the death of Robert Greene, the dramatist.\r\nThe trap for the life of the Emperor Antoninus Pius was baited, as De\r\nQuincey expresses it, with toasted cheese. Kaiser Karl VI. was the victim\r\nof a voracious repast on mushrooms stewed in oil.\r\n\r\nWhen Hadrian found his illness on the increase, and his end approaching,\r\nhe removed to Baiæ, where, “in spite of the prescriptions [or\r\nproscriptions?] of his physicians, he began to eat and drink according\r\nto his pleasure.” The excesses of Charles V. in the same way are\r\nexceptionally notorious. Of that “little, spare, aguish, peevish,\r\nsupper-eating” sovereign, Frederick the Great, who loved his dishes the\r\nmore they tormented him, it is on record, that on the approach of death,\r\n“this warrior full of courage and sage speculation,” could not resist the\r\ncustomary pepper and sauce piquante, though he knew it would inevitably\r\nresult in a nightmare, “turning his bed into a nest of monsters.” So\r\nwith the Duke Augustus commemorated by Perthes: “All medical skill was\r\nin vain, for this half crazy prince could not deny himself the stimulus\r\nof the hottest spices.” Mr. Tennyson’s dying Northern Farmer is only too\r\ntrue a type of his kind:—\r\n\r\n    “What atta stannin’ theer for, an’ doesn bring ma the yaäle?\r\n    Doctor’s a’tottler, lass, an a’s hallus i’ the owd taäle;\r\n    I weänt breäk rules for doctor, a knaws naw more nor a floy;\r\n    Git ma my yaäle I tell tha, an’ gin I mun doy I mun doy.”\r\n\r\nSwift is giving Pope a significant and not uncalled-for hint, when he\r\nwrites to express his uneasiness at ever hearing of the poet’s being\r\nout to dinner: “For the least transgression of yours, if it be only two\r\nbits and one sup more than your stint, is a great debauch; for which\r\nyou certainly pay more than those sots who are carried dead drunk to\r\nbed.” An entry in Mrs. Trench’s diary begins, “Dined at the Duke of\r\nQueensberry’s. He is very ill—has a violent cough, but _will_ eat an\r\nimmense dinner, and then complains of a _digestion pénible_.” Another\r\nof his quality has been described as taking all sorts of pains to get\r\na little enjoyment which must produce for him a world of misery. “One\r\nof his passions which he _will_ not resist, is for a particular dish,\r\npungent, savoury, and multifarious, which sends him almost every night\r\ninto Tartarus.” Mr. Thackeray’s moribund old Madame Bernstein _will_ have\r\nher supper luxurious, “nor could any injunction of ours or the doctor’s\r\nteach her abstinence.” The Sir Miles St. John of another popular fiction\r\ndoes himself to death after the same manner: “He would have his own\r\nway; and he contrived to coax or to force his doctor into an authority\r\non his side.” For doctors are not all of the kind that Sancho Panza had\r\nto deal with when governor of Barataria. _The Doctor_ cites the case of\r\nan eminent member of “the faculty,” who could never refrain from eating\r\ntoasted cheese, though he was subject to an alarming pulmonary complaint\r\nwhich was uniformly aggravated by it, and which terminated fatally at an\r\nage by no means advanced. Another he relates, of a physician who, at an\r\nautumnal dessert never ceased eating all the filberts he could lay his\r\nhands upon, while candidly acknowledging what indigestible and hurtful\r\nthings they were.\r\n\r\nNot a doctor apparently of medicine, but (_proh pudor!_) of divinity, was\r\nthat Cambridge don of whose end Gray makes memorable mention, as having\r\ngone to his grave with five fine mackarel (large and full of roe) in his\r\ninside. “He ate them all off at one dinner; but his fate was a turbot on\r\nTrinity Sunday, of which he left little for the company besides bones.\r\nHe had not been hearty all the week; but after this sixth fish he never\r\nheld up his head more.” Like Milton’s Eve, in one sense at least:—\r\n\r\n    “Greedily he ingorged without restraint,\r\n    And knew not eating death.”\r\n\r\nDr. Johnson’s friend, Thrale, is a noteworthy example, or warning, of the\r\nman of appetite, who _will not_ restrain it; will not put a knife to his\r\nthroat, but prefers sending a full laden fork in that direction. His wife\r\ndescribes his natural disposition to conviviality as degenerating into\r\na preternatural desire for food. “No one could control his appetite.”\r\n“Burney and I and Queeney tease him every meal he eats, and Mrs. Montagu\r\nis quite serious with him; but what _can_ one do? He will eat, I think;\r\nand if he does eat, I know he will not live.” The lampreys that were one\r\ntoo many for Henry the king, were one too many for Thrale the brewer. He\r\nbegged some of an old friend, and the old friend complied, despite the\r\nfrowns and negative signals of the ladies of the house—whom following\r\nout of the room, the too compliant visitor thus made his apology to Mrs.\r\nThrale, “I understand you, Madam, but _must_ disobey. A friend I have\r\nknown thirty-six years shall not ask a favour of me in his last stage\r\nof life and be refused. What difference can it make?” Tears stood in\r\n_his_ eyes, and Mrs. Thrale’s own—_les larmes dans la voix_—prevented\r\nall reply. What difference did it make? That day was Mr. Thrale’s last.\r\nThe tone of the apology reminds us of General Paoli’s answer to Boswell,\r\nwhen whispering his fear lest Johnson, very aged and very ailing, might\r\nbe hurt by the amount and variety of what he was despatching at the\r\ngeneral’s table, “where he loved to dine.” Boswell begged Paoli not to\r\npress him. Why urge a too willing horse? “Alas!” said the host, “see\r\nhow very ill he looks: he can live but a very short time. Would you\r\nrefuse a slight gratification to a man under sentence of death?” And the\r\ngeneral cited approvingly the “humane custom” in Italy, by which those\r\nin Johnson’s position were indulged with having whatever they liked\r\nbest to eat and drink, even with expensive delicacies. A parallel case\r\nwe have in Sir Walter Scott, during his melancholy sojourn in Italy, as\r\nSir W. Gell describes his dining at a Roman palace, and his own fears\r\nlest, from the hospitality of the Torlonia family, and “with servants on\r\nall sides pressing him to eat and drink, as is their custom at Rome,”\r\nSir Walter might be induced to eat more than was safe for his malady.\r\n“Colonel Blair, who sat next him, was requested to take care that this\r\nshould not happen. Whenever I observed him, however, Sir Walter appeared\r\nalways to be eating; while the duchess, who had discovered the nature of\r\nthe office imposed on the colonel, was by no means satisfied, and after\r\ndinner observed that it was an odd sort of friendship which consisted in\r\nstarving one’s neighbour to death, when he had a good appetite, and there\r\nwas dinner enough.”\r\n\r\nThe selfish club-man _par excellence_ has been depicted as earthing\r\nhimself from pursuit in the sanctuary of his club, there to eat his fill\r\nunmolested, with no remonstrant at hand to remind him of the gout when\r\nenjoying his turtle, or to talk of cupping when the glass of champagne is\r\nat his lips. “There he may eat his asparagus _tout à l’huile_—there he\r\nmay pepper his cream-tart,” and none to say him nay. Drawn with pitiless\r\nrealism from the life is Acton Bell (Anne Brontè)’s picture of the dying\r\nmaster of Wildfell Hall, whose extreme dread of death, when and while it\r\nseems imminent, renders easy his wife’s task of curbing his unruly greed,\r\nbut who becomes intractable as the danger to dear life seems receding.\r\n“I watch and restrain him,” she writes, “as well as I can, and often get\r\nbitterly abused for my rigid severity; and sometimes he contrives to\r\nelude my vigilance, and sometimes acts in opposition to my will.” William\r\nCollins, the painter, notes in his diary a certain “dinner at C⸺’s,”\r\nwhere he “sat next to H⸺, who took some highly seasoned omelet. I asked\r\nhim how he could venture on such stuff; he said he could not resist it,\r\nthough he knew how much he should suffer from it. He took a great deal\r\nof wine, to overcome the effects of the omelet, and assured me he should\r\nbe ill for four days after such a dinner, and that he always suffered in\r\nthe same way after dining with C⸺! How absurd such weakness appears, and\r\nyet how common it is!” George Herbert’s counsel is never out of date,\r\nany more than King Solomon’s, in the matter of putting a knife to one’s\r\nthroat, if edacious and a diner-out:—\r\n\r\n    “Look to thy mouth: diseases enter there....\r\n    ... Carve, or discourse; do not a famine fear.\r\n    Who carves is kind to two, who talks to all.\r\n    Look on meat, think it dirt, then eat a bit;\r\n    Then say withal, Earth to earth I commit.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_HAZAEL’S ABHORRENT REPUDIATION OF HIS FUTURE SELF._\r\n\r\n2 KINGS viii. 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy wept Elisha in the presence of Hazael, when that envoy from the sick\r\nking of Syria courted the man of God, in his sovereign’s behalf, with\r\na consignment of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels’ burden?\r\nCourteous and gentle was Benhadad’s messenger who came to inquire of\r\nthe Lord of Elisha, if the royal Syrian should recover of the disease\r\nwhich had brought him so low. Why wept the prophet, when his prophecy\r\nhad been uttered, ominously vague? “Go, say unto him [Benhadad], Thou\r\nmayest certainly recover. Howbeit the Lord hath showed me that he shall\r\ncertainly die.” And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was\r\nashamed.\r\n\r\n“And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know\r\nthe evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel; their strongholds\r\nwilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword,\r\nand wilt dash their children,” etc. And Hazael said, “But what! is thy\r\nservant a dog, that he should do this great thing?”\r\n\r\nYet Hazael went home, and on the very morrow commenced his justification\r\nof the seer’s previsionary tears, by spreading a thick wet cloth on the\r\nface of his master, so that Benhadad, who else would have recovered,\r\ndied, and Hazael reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\nWell might the man of God weep, nor could anything be more natural,\r\nor at least naturally assumed, than the shuddering repudiation, the\r\ndeprecating protest, of the envoy that now was, the king—and dog—that\r\nto-morrow should be.\r\n\r\n    “Lui-même, à son portrait forcé de rendre hommage,\r\n    Il frémira d’horreur devant sa propre image.”\r\n\r\nThe man who is weak, observes Miss Lee in the “Canterbury Tales,”\r\nis always in danger of becoming a villain; and she exemplifies this\r\nliability in the instance of Villars, who, by indulging a passion\r\ncalculated to enfeeble his understanding and corrupt his heart, is\r\nsoon to be found touching that point which his high tone of romantic\r\nrefinement had once induced him to believe it impossible he should\r\neven approach. But he protests too much who strenuously protests, with\r\nprotestation heaped on protestation, against any such possible lapse and\r\ncollapse on his part; and there are cases of this kind, of which one may\r\nsay with Molière—\r\n\r\n    “Que c’est être à demi ce que l’on vient de dire,\r\n    Que de vouloir jurer qu’on ne le sera pas.”\r\n\r\nMartial is in the right in answering the inquiry of Priscus, how would\r\nhe live if he became rich and great all at once, with another query, Who\r\ncan say beforehand what his future conduct will be? _Quemquam posse putas\r\nmores narrare futuros?_ If Priscus were to become a lion, what sort of\r\none would he turn out to be? Perhaps like Hazael, a dog.\r\n\r\nIn sight of a corpse suspended to a tree, the “miserable remnant of a\r\nwretch that was hanged there for murder,” Robert, in one of Tobin’s\r\ndramas, protests to his mother that, robber though he be, _he_ is no\r\nmurderer; she replies:—\r\n\r\n                    “You are a robber;\r\n    And he who robs, by sharp resistance pressed,\r\n    Will end the deed in blood: ’twas so with him;\r\n    He once possessed a soul quick as your own\r\n    To mercy, and would quake, as you do now,\r\n    At the bare apprehension of the act\r\n    That has consigned him to yon blasted tree.”\r\n\r\nDr. Hamilton somewhere adverts to a sort of gambling in our large\r\ncities which does not look particularly repulsive—not being carried on\r\nin “hells,” and pleading the sanction of some titled names; the results,\r\nhowever, of which are hanging like a millstone round the neck of many\r\na once promising young man; while, to say nothing of those whom it\r\nhas reduced to beggary or blackguardism, numbers of its victims must\r\nbe sought in the Portland hulks or Dartmoor prison. “They went to the\r\nrace-course, or, without going there, they laid wagers on horses, and\r\nsooner or later they lost more than they could pay, and in dread of\r\ndishonour they took means to get the money at the very suggestion of\r\nwhich, once upon a time, they would indignantly have exclaimed, ‘Is thy\r\nservant a dog?’ and after a few miserable makeshifts, only adding sin to\r\nsin, there came detection and ruin and disgrace.” It is of the riotous\r\nliving of prodigal sons that the same preacher is treating, when he\r\nshows, in his graphic way, how speedily riot, whether coarse or refined,\r\nwastes the reveller’s substance—not only sapping the constitution, and\r\nsoftening the brain, and shattering the nerves, and enfeebling the\r\nmind, but exhausting the estate, and soon bringing the spendthrift to\r\npoverty. And, as the discourser goes on to say, if the passion still\r\nurges, and the fear of God has departed, wild methods will be used to\r\nmeet the demand and assuage the frantic craving. “Keepsakes will be sold\r\nor pledged, to part with which would, once upon a time, have looked like\r\nsacrilege.” Perhaps money will be taken from the till, and so on and on,\r\nor rather downwards and downwards, deeper and deeper, till the lowest\r\ndeep is sounded, and darkness is the burier of the dead.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked by one of the most reflective of our popular\r\nauthors, that there is a terrible coercion in our deeds which may first\r\nturn the honest man into a deceiver, and then reconcile him to the\r\nchange, for this reason—that the second wrong presents itself to him\r\nin the guise of the only practicable right. “The action which before\r\ncommission has been seen with that blended common-sense and fresh\r\nuntarnished feeling which is the healthy eye of the soul, is looked\r\nat afterwards with the lens of apologetic ingenuity, through which\r\nall things that men call beautiful and ugly are seen to be made up of\r\ntextures very much alike.” Europe, it is suggestively added, adjusts\r\nitself to a _fait accompli_; and so does an individual character—until\r\nthe placid adjustment is disturbed by a convulsive retribution.\r\n\r\nRecording the appointment of Bonaparte to succeed Scherer in command of\r\nthe French forces on Genoese territory, Southey observes that although\r\nthe former had given indications of his military talents at Toulon, and\r\nof his remorseless nature at Paris, “the extent either of his ability\r\nor his wickedness was at this time known to none, and perhaps not even\r\nsuspected by himself.” Of all the lessons derived from the history\r\nof human passion, says Lavalette, the most important is the utter\r\nimpossibility which even the best men will always experience of stopping,\r\nif they are once led into the path of error. If, a few years before they\r\nwere perpetrated, the crimes of the first French Revolution, he goes on\r\nto surmise, could have been portrayed to those who committed them, “even\r\nRobespierre himself would have recoiled with horror.” Men, in the case\r\nsuggested, are seduced at first by plausible theories, which their heated\r\nimaginations represent as beneficial and easy of execution: “they advance\r\nunconsciously from errors to faults, and from faults to crimes, till\r\nsensibility is destroyed by the habitual spectacle of guilt, and the most\r\nsavage atrocities come to be dignified by the name of state policy.”\r\n\r\nThe world, and the spirit of the world, observes Sir Fowell Buxton in\r\none of his letters, are very insidious; “and more than once I have\r\nseen a person who, as a youth, was single-eyed and single-hearted, and\r\nwho, to any one who supposed he might glide into laxity of zeal, would\r\nhave said, ‘Am I a dog?’ in maturer age become, if not a lover of the\r\nvices of the world, at least a tolerator of its vanities.” But as M. de\r\nSainte-Beuve sententiously puts it, in one of his maxims after the manner\r\nof La Rochefoucauld, “La plupart des défauts qui éclatent dans la seconde\r\nmoitié de la vie existaient en nous tout formés bien auparavant; mais\r\nils étaient masqués, en quelque sorte, par la pudeur de la jeunesse.”\r\nThe faults of after-life were there, and only the modest reserve and\r\nself-restraint of youth kept them under cover. With riper years comes\r\nless regard for others, and the cover is taken off.\r\n\r\nA clerical essayist on “Future Years,” “can well believe,” he tells us,\r\n“that many a man, could he have a glimpse in innocent youth of what he\r\nwill be twenty or thirty years after, would pray in anguish to be taken\r\nbefore coming to _that_!” “Mansie Wauch’s glimpse of destitution was bad\r\nenough; but a million times worse is a glimpse of hardened and unabashed\r\nsin and shame.” And it would be no comfort, we are reminded—it would be\r\nan aggravation in that view—to think that by the time you have reached\r\nthat miserable point, you will have grown pretty well reconciled to\r\nit—_that_ being the worst of all.\r\n\r\nHazael stands out in large type, black letter type, or red letter, if\r\nyou will—the hue of blood—a degraded instance of the degrading power of\r\nguilt—a warning of the stealthy yet swift aggression of criminal impulse,\r\nor criminal policy, seducing, subduing, and transforming its subjects,—\r\n\r\n    “Till creatures born,\r\n      For good (whose hearts kind Pity nursed)\r\n      Will act the direst crimes they cursed\r\n    But yester-morn.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE OPEN RIGHT HAND’S SECRET FROM THE LEFT._\r\n\r\nST. MATTHEW vi. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo some of us, to very many, it may seem that the Sermon might well be on\r\na Mount, that set forth such a text as this: “But when thou doest alms,\r\nlet not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth.” The atmosphere is\r\nof other altitudes than here below. We may not sound a trumpet before\r\nus, as the hypocrites did in the synagogue and in the streets, to have\r\nglory of men; and verily, every man his own trumpeter, they had their\r\nreward. But as to keeping our open-handed doles and donations a secret,\r\nas it were, from our other self; as to concealing from the left hand\r\nthe furtive bounties and stealthy almsgiving of the right, that is a\r\npractical transcendentalism mostly undreamt of in our philosophy.\r\n\r\nYet are there, and ever will be, those—else had this earth of ours lost\r\nthe salt of the earth, and wherewith then should it be salted?—who—\r\n\r\n    “Do good by stealth, and blush to find it fame.”\r\n\r\nThe larger number of benefactors, who, as the caustic French wit,\r\nChamfort, puts it, pretend to conceal themselves after effecting a deed\r\nof kindness, betake themselves to flight and a hiding-place only as\r\nVirgil’s Galatea did, with a decided wish to be seen first: _Et se cupit\r\nante videri._ Another of Chamfort’s cynical _maximes et pensées_ runs\r\nthus: “Il y a peu de bienfaiteurs qui ne disent comme Satan, _Si cadens\r\nadoraveris me_.” Whom the vulgar succour, they oppress, says Crabbe. They\r\nhave as little sympathy with, or interest in, the rule of keeping the\r\nright hand’s largesse a secret from the left, as with Peter of Aragon’s\r\nfamous refusal to let Pope Martin IV know what were his designs against\r\nthe infidel. Peter implored the blessing of the Holy Father on his scheme\r\nof action; “but if he thought his right hand knew his secret, he would\r\ncut it off, lest it should betray it to his left.” And the vulgar mean\r\nthe commonalty, the many, the _polloi_. The doer of good, therefore, who\r\ndoes it by stealth, is the exception to a rule; and as an exception he is\r\ntreated in literature and life as what is called a “character.” Goldsmith\r\nmakes a highly pronounced character of his man in black, whose hand is\r\nopen as day to melting charity, while he professes to keep it closed\r\ntight as wax and hard as steel. He bullies in words a petitioner for\r\naid, while he is but studying what method he shall take to relieve him\r\nunobserved. “He had, however,” writes the Chinese citizen of the world,\r\n“no easy part to act, as he was obliged to preserve the appearance of\r\nill-nature before me, and yet relieve himself by relieving the sailor.”\r\nAnd by contrivance he gains his end. The mandarin’s curiosity to know\r\n“what could be his motives for thus concealing virtues which others take\r\nsuch pains to display,” is natural, and finds natural expression; and\r\nthereby hangs the tale of the “reluctantly good” Man in Black. Smollett,\r\nagain, makes one of his heroes, though young and pleasure-loving,\r\nretrench his expenses in order to help the needy: “Numberless were the\r\nobjects to which he extended his charity in private. Indeed, he exerted\r\nthis virtue in secret, not only on account of avoiding the charge of\r\nostentation, but also because he was ashamed of being detected in such\r\nan awkward, unfashionable practice by the censorious observers of this\r\nhumane generation. In this particular he seemed to confound the ideas of\r\nvirtue and vice; for he did good as other people do evil, by stealth; and\r\nwas [like the man in black] so capricious in point of behaviour, that\r\nfrequently, in public, he wagged his tongue in satirical animadversions\r\nupon that poverty which his hand had, in private, relieved.” It cannot be\r\naffirmed of him that he exemplified, in detail, all the attributes of a\r\nportrait from life, but after death, by Cowper; but some of them he did:\r\n\r\n    “Yet was thy liberality discreet,\r\n    Nice in its choice, and of a tempered heat;\r\n    And though in act unwearied, _secret still_,\r\n    As in some solitude the summer rill\r\n    Refreshes, where it winds, the faded green,\r\n    And cheers the drooping flowers, _unheard_, _unseen_.”\r\n\r\nWhen a biographer can accredit the subject of his narrative with a\r\ndisposition to hide his bounty, he is usually apt enough to catch at so\r\ncatching a quality. Wellington, we are told, though his name so rarely\r\nfigured on subscription lists, was very liberal in his charities, and was\r\nnot unfrequently victimized by impostors. During the Irish famine he is\r\nsaid to have distributed at least £10,000 among the relief committees;\r\nbut “he never said a word about it at Exeter Hall.” Free gifts by\r\nstealth are often characteristic of such natures as Byron’s; of whom,\r\nfor instance, we read that, soon after Lord Falkland’s death, the poet\r\nreminded the unfortunate widow that he was to be godfather to her infant\r\n[Byron a sponsor!—but let that pass]; and that after the “christening” he\r\ninserted a five-hundred pound note in a breakfast cup; but in so cautious\r\na manner that it was not discovered until he had left the house.\r\nMontesquieu was even hard and harsh in his repudiation of thanks from\r\nthose he helped; his kindness was accordingly (to speak by quibble) less\r\nthan kind; insomuch that one critic recognises in him “un de ces dieux\r\nbienfaiteurs de l’humanité, mais qui n’en partagent point la tendresse.”\r\nGrimm is another example of a satirical tongue with an open hand, only\r\nthe hand was opened behind his own back: _il sut être bienveillant en\r\nsecret_. Amid James Watt’s donations in aid of sound and useful learning,\r\ntestifies one biographer, were not wanting others prescribed by true\r\nreligion, for the consolation of the poor, and relief of the afflicted;\r\nbut these works were done in secret, and with injunctions that his name\r\nshould not be made known. Goethe seems to have preserved profound secrecy\r\nwith respect to some signal exercises of his beneficence. Cowper tells\r\nUnwin, in one of his letters, that a recent endeavour of that good pastor\r\nto relieve the indigent of his flock would probably have succeeded better\r\n“had it been an affair of more notoriety than merely to furnish a few\r\npoor fellows with a little fuel to preserve their extremities from the\r\nfrost.” “Men really pious delight in doing good by stealth;[30] but\r\nnothing less than an ostentatious display of bounty will satisfy mankind\r\nin general.” The Olney bard, in after years, had pleasant dealings with\r\na signal exemplar of the benefactor by stealth. He was made the almoner\r\nof a charitable stranger, to whom he thus refers in a letter to John\r\nNewton: “Like the subterraneous flue that warms my myrtles, he does good\r\nand is unseen. His injunctions of secrecy are still as rigorous as ever,\r\nand must therefore be observed with the same attention.” A year later: “I\r\nshall probably never see him,” writes Cowper, in relating a fresh tide\r\nof benefactions; but “he will always have a niche in the museum of my\r\nreverential remembrance.” Even without _that_, the Unknown had his reward.\r\n\r\n                              “Charity ever\r\n    Finds in the act reward, and needs no trumpet\r\n    In the receiver.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_TO-MORROW._\r\n\r\nST. JAMES iv. 13, 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rich man in the parable was self-complacently far-sighted in his\r\nforesight, when he took stock of his much goods laid up for many years;\r\nbut that very night his soul was to be required of him. Take thine ease;\r\neat, drink, and be merry, was his easy-going style of self-communing:\r\nmany are the years in store for thee, and all of these well stored\r\nwith whatever makes this life worth the living. And just in the same\r\neasy-going style is pitched the prospective self-assurance of the\r\nworldlings censured by St. James. “Go to now, ye that say, to-day or\r\nto-morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and\r\nbuy, and sell, and get gain: whereas ye know not what shall be on the\r\nmorrow. For what is your life? it is even a vapour that appeareth for a\r\nlittle time, and then vanisheth away.” Boast not thyself of to-morrow,\r\nfor thou knowest not what a day may bring forth. To-day, while it is\r\ncalled to-day,—hardly this can be called thine. But to-morrow, whose is\r\nthat? Even the uttermost sensualist owns it to be none of his, when he\r\nsets up for his motto, at once a reminder to live fast and a _memento\r\nmori_,—Let us eat and drink to-day, for to-morrow we die. So far he is\r\nat least verbally wiser than his brethren of the cup and the platter,\r\nwhose style is, “Come ye, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves\r\nwith strong drink; and to-morrow shall be as this day, and much more\r\nabundant.” Little reck they of the platitude that all flesh is grass,\r\nwhich to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven.\r\n\r\nMacbeth’s threefold To-morrow is a triplet that by no means goes\r\ntrippingly off the tongue:—\r\n\r\n    “TO-MORROW, AND TO-MORROW, AND TO-MORROW,\r\n    Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,\r\n    To the last syllable of recorded time;\r\n    And all our yesterdays have lighted fools\r\n    The way to dusty death.”\r\n\r\nSo muses the usurper, besieged in his last fastness, while the cry is\r\nstill, _They come_—even the enemy and the avenger; a cry varied by one\r\nof women bewailing their mistress dead. He has supped full of horrors;\r\nand the cry of “The queen, my lord, is dead,” but elicits for response,\r\n“She should have died hereafter; there would have been a time for such a\r\nword.—_To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow._”...\r\n\r\nIn some such mood was usurping Gloster, on the eve of destruction,\r\npitching his tent on Bosworth Field, and meditating,—\r\n\r\n    ... “Here will I lie to-night;\r\n            [_Soldiers begin to set up the King’s tent._\r\n    But where to-morrow?—Well, all’s one for that.”\r\n\r\nTo the meanest private in rank and file the to-morrow that shall bring on\r\na battle cannot but be a momentous thought. As his grace of York says, on\r\nthe eve of Hotspur’s encounter with the king’s forces at Shrewsbury,—\r\n\r\n    “To-morrow, good Sir Michael, is a day\r\n    Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men\r\n    Must ’bide the touch.”\r\n\r\nWhile there’s life there’s hope, and hope is, by the nature of it,\r\nintent on to-morrow. As with hopes, so with fears. And hopes and fears\r\ntogether make up the sum of what has interest in life. No wonder, then,\r\nif to-morrow is a frequent word with the poet-philosopher of human life;\r\nand that in comedy and in tragedy alike, it serves his turn. Be it a\r\nwedding for to-morrow or an execution for to-morrow, Shakspeare iterates\r\nand reiterates the phrase, with all the dramatic realism that informs\r\nand vivifies his creations. Is it the wedding of Hero with Claudio, for\r\ninstance? “When are you married, madam?” asks Ursula of the bride; who,\r\nwith affected levity, replies,—\r\n\r\n    “Why, every day; to-morrow. Come, go in;\r\n    I’ll show thee some attires; and have thy counsel,\r\n    Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nLittle she recks of what is to betide her ere to-morrow dawn. Or is it an\r\nexecution? Hear Angelo’s decree against another (quite another) Claudio:\r\n\r\n    “Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,\r\n    It would be thus with him;—he must die to-morrow.\r\n\r\n    _Isab._ To-morrow! O, that’s sudden! Spare, him, spare him;\r\n            He’s not prepared for death.”\r\n\r\nMany scenes later we have the Provost imparting his fate to the doomed\r\nman:—\r\n\r\n    “Look, here’s the warrant, Claudio, for thy death:\r\n    ’Tis now dead-midnight, and by eight to-morrow\r\n    Thou must be made immortal.”\r\n\r\nPresently the disguised duke comes in, and asks of the Provost,—\r\n\r\n    “Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,\r\n    But he must die to-morrow?\r\n\r\n    _Prov._                None, sir; none.”\r\n\r\nOne may wonder whether Macbeth, brooding on the vague and vasty gloom of\r\nthat word, bethought him of the fatal first use of it in his incipient\r\ndesigns against his sovran. The gracious Duncan, he tells his wife, on\r\nreaching home, is to become his guest to-night:\r\n\r\n    “_Lady M._ And when goes hence?\r\n\r\n    _Macb._ To-morrow,—as he purposes.\r\n\r\n    _Lady M._                      O, never\r\n    Shall sun that morrow see!”\r\n\r\nReason good, or rather, in a bad sense, reason of the worst, had Macbeth\r\nto brood in after-days, when the morrow that never came to Duncan,\r\nhad come blood-stained to _him_,—on the far-reaching capacities of\r\nso memorable a phrase. But from Shakspeare turn to other sources of\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nTruth as well as pathos has been justly ascribed to the following\r\nexpansion of a very natural sentiment—“the fear of personal oblivion\r\nin one’s own home”—artistically rendered by one of a gifted family of\r\nartists:\r\n\r\n    “I listened to their honest chat;\r\n      Said one: ‘To-morrow we shall be\r\n    Plod, plod along the featureless sands\r\n      And coasting miles and miles of sea.’\r\n    Said one: ‘Before the turn of tide\r\n      We will achieve the eyrie-seat.’\r\n    Said one: ‘To-morrow shall be like\r\n      To-day, but much more sweet.’\r\n    ‘To-morrow,’ said they, strong with hope,\r\n      And dwelt upon the pleasant way;\r\n    ‘To-morrow,’ cried they, one and all,\r\n      While no one spoke of yesterday.\r\n    Then life stood still at blessed noon,\r\n      I, only I, had passed away:\r\n    ‘To-morrow and to-day,’ they cried:\r\n      I was of yesterday.”\r\n\r\nIt is a critical point in Mr. Charles Reade’s story of what he calls very\r\nhard cash, when Noah Skinner, the fraudulent banker’s clerk, old and\r\ndying, proposes to himself, and resolves to deliver up, to-morrow, the\r\nreceipt for fourteen thousand pounds, his criminal possession and crafty\r\nretention of which has caused such profound and wide-spread misery.\r\n“A sleepy languor now came over him; ... but his resolution remained\r\nunshaken; by-and-by waking up from a sort of heavy dose, he took, as it\r\nwere a last look at the receipt, and murmured, ‘My head, how heavy it\r\nfeels.’ But presently he roused himself, full of his penitent resolution,\r\nand murmured again brokenly, ‘I’ll—take it to—Pembroke-street to—morrow:\r\nto—mor—row.” Fool—like other us fools of nature—that night his soul was\r\nrequired of him. The to-morrow found him, and so did the detectives, dead.\r\n\r\nAmong other visitors and applicants at the mystical Intelligence Office\r\nthrown open to our gaze by Nathaniel Hawthorne, there totters hastily\r\nin a grandfatherly personage, so earnest in his uniform alacrity that\r\nhis white hair floats backwards as he hurries up to the desk, while his\r\ndim eyes catch a momentary lustre from his vehemence of purpose. This\r\nvenerable figure explains that he is in search of To-morrow.\r\n\r\n“I have spent all my life in pursuit of it,” adds the sage old gentleman,\r\n“being assured that To-morrow has some vast benefit or other in store\r\nfor me. But I am now getting a little in years, and must make haste, for\r\nunless I overtake To-morrow soon, I begin to be afraid it will finally\r\nescape me.”\r\n\r\n“This fugitive To-morrow, my venerable friend,” said the Man of\r\nIntelligence, “is a stray child of Time, and is flying from his father\r\ninto the region of the infinite. Continue your pursuit, and you will\r\ndoubtless come up with him; but as to the earthly gifts which you expect,\r\nhe has scattered them all among a throng of Yesterdays.”\r\n\r\nThe grandsire is obliged to content himself with this enigmatical\r\nresponse, and hastens forth with a quick clatter of his staff upon the\r\nfloor; and as he disappears, a little boy scampers through the door in\r\nchase of a butterfly, which has got astray amid the barren sunshine of\r\nthe city. Had the old gentleman, suggests our ever-suggestive moralist,\r\nbeen shrewder, he might have detected To-morrow under the semblance of\r\nthat gaudy insect.\r\n\r\n_J’ai vécu_—I managed to keep alive—was the Abbé Siéyès’ answer to those\r\nwho, in after days, asked him how he spent his time in the Reign of\r\nTerror. And it is in allusion to his position at that season of peril,\r\nwhen no one could reckon on a morrow—_nul ne pouvait se promettre un\r\nlendemain_—that he quotes the _vers charmants_ made in 1708 by Maucroix,\r\nthen fourscore and upwards:—\r\n\r\n    “Chaque jour est un bien que du Ciel je reçoi!\r\n      Jouissons aujourd’hui de celui qu’il nous donne:\r\n    Il n’appartient pas plus aux jeunes gens qu’à moi,\r\n      Et celui de demain n’appartient à personne.”\r\n\r\n“What shall we be doing to-morrow at this time?” said Ducos, as the\r\nGirondins were whiling away their last evening here on earth. And each of\r\nthem replied as the humour took him, or the subject impressed him. The\r\nfavourite answer seems to have been, We shall sleep after the fatigues\r\nof the day. To some the feeling may have been, too literally and very\r\nbitterly, what Wordsworth versified as he gazed from Rydal Mount on a\r\nslowly-sinking star:\r\n\r\n                  “We struggle with our fate,\r\n    While health, power, glory, from their height decline,\r\n    Depressed; and then extinguished; and our state,\r\n    In this, how different, lost Star, from thine,\r\n    That no to-morrow shall our beams restore!”\r\n\r\nTo-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow. For some time had the Emperor\r\nFrancis—Maria Theresa’s consort—been threatened with an apoplexy, when,\r\non the morning of the 18th of August, 1764, being pressed by his sister\r\nto be blooded, he answered, “I am engaged this evening to sup with\r\nJoseph, and will not disappoint him; but I promise you I will be blooded\r\nto-morrow.” At the opera in the evening he was taken ill. Retiring, he\r\nwas struck with apoplexy, and died at Joseph’s feet, for he had fallen\r\nfrom Joseph’s arms. At his feet—like one of old time—he bowed, he fell,\r\nhe lay down: at his feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell\r\ndown dead.\r\n\r\nBoast not thyself of to-morrow. Hardly less hackneyed in the ear of\r\nscholar and schoolboy, yet hardly less impressive as truisms with\r\never-living truth in them, are Horace’s\r\n\r\n    Quis scit an adjiciant hodiernæ crastina summæ\r\n    Tempora Di superi?\r\n\r\n(who knows whether the powers above will add a morrow to the day that now\r\nis?), and Seneca’s Never was man so in favour with the gods as to be able\r\nto promise himself a morrow:\r\n\r\n    Nemo tam divos habuit faventes,\r\n    Crastinum ut possit sibi polliceri.\r\n\r\nWhen Archias, the polemarch at Thebes, dissolved in wine and pleasure,\r\nreceived from his pontifical namesake at Athens a full and particular\r\naccount by letter of the conspiracy of Pelopidas and the exiles, who were\r\neven then counting the minutes ere they struck the blow,—although the\r\nmessenger expressly urged his excellency to read the missive forthwith,\r\nas the contents were of instant import, Archias only smiled a tipsy\r\nsmile, and said, “Business to-morrow.” Then he put the unopened letter\r\nunder the bolster of his couch, and resumed his colloquy with his host,\r\nPhilidias, who was in the plot, and who was taking good care to ply the\r\npolemarch with wine. Business to-morrow. To-morrow as he purposed! Oh,\r\nnever should sun that morrow see.\r\n\r\n_Si hodie non es paratus, quo modo cras eris? CRAS est dies incertus:\r\net qui scis si crastinum habebis_? To-morrow, in this its prospective,\r\nprocrastinating sense, is denounced by Mr. Sala, with all due asperity,\r\nas a wretched, cowardly, idiotic subterfuge and apology—a “suicidal\r\ndelusion and pitfall.” Yes, to-morrow I will begin to learn Syro-Chaldaic\r\n(we overhear him saying): I will read the novel of the day to-day.\r\nTo-morrow I will dine on a mutton-chop and a glass of water. To-day I\r\nwill ask the _chef_ at the club to send me up a pretty little dinner,\r\nnot forgetting that irresistible _choufleur au gratin_, and bid the\r\nbutler bring me that curious pommard with the iron-grey seal. To-morrow\r\nI will finish my _magnum opus_, my “Treatise on the Books of Job and\r\nEcclesiastes in their relation to Human Wisdom and Knowledge.” To-day\r\nflippant rubbish or frothy egotism shall flow from my pen. To-morrow I\r\nwill pay my tailor. To-day I will order a new coat. In fine: “To-morrow I\r\nwill atone for the wrong, and pray for strength to continue in the right.\r\nTo-day I will follow my devices, and listen to the promptings of the\r\nworld, the flesh, and the devil. To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nFor many years, the late Alfred de Vigny continued slowly amassing\r\npoetical materials, though publishing nothing, and murmuring always, like\r\nAndré Chenier,—\r\n\r\n    “Rien n’est fait aujourd’hui, tout sera fait _demain_.”\r\n\r\nThe morrow has come, wrote the _Journal des Débats_, in recording his\r\ndeath, and his artist hands are cold in the grave.\r\n\r\nSays the Cordelier to the condemned Thief in Mat Prior’s derry-down\r\nballad,—\r\n\r\n    “Courage, friend; to-day is your period of sorrow;\r\n    And things will go better, believe me, to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nBut what says the Thief in reply?\r\n\r\n    “To-morrow? our hero replied in a fright:\r\n    He that’s hanged before noon, ought to think of to-night.”\r\n\r\nBut Prior will supply us with more than one study of the subject. Here is\r\na variation, for instance, in matter, manner, and metre:—\r\n\r\n    “The hoary fool, who many days\r\n      Has struggled with continued sorrow,\r\n    Renews his hope, and blindly lays\r\n      The desperate bet upon to-morrow.\r\n\r\n    “To-morrow comes; ’tis noon, ’tis night;\r\n      This day like all the former flies:\r\n    Yet on he runs, to seek delight\r\n      To-morrow, till to-night he dies.”\r\n\r\nThe gaming allusion of the first stanza reminds us of the picture of\r\na certain devotee at the _roulette_ table at Hombourg, who kept his\r\nseat—tranquil, immovable, vigilant,—the Napoleon of _roulette_; in whose\r\nvictorious progress Marengos and Austerlitzes succeeded each other, as\r\nif Moscow and the Beresina were phantoms—as if to-morrow would never\r\ncome. To-morrow; ay, that dread to-morrow that comes to all: the fateful\r\n_Demain_ of Victor:\r\n\r\n    “Demain est la sapin du trône,\r\n    Aujourd’hui c’en est le velours.”\r\n\r\nYes, to-morrow is the coarse deal, with its ten sacks, that forms the\r\nframework of the throne, as to-day is its velvet and gilding.\r\n\r\n    “Demain c’est le coursier qui s’abat plein d’écume;\r\n    Demain, O conquérant, c’est Moscou qui s’allume\r\n        La nuit comme un flambeau:\r\n    C’est not’ vieille garde qui jonche au lointain la plaine,\r\n    Demain c’est Waterloo! Demain c’est Ste. Helène!\r\n        Demain c’est le tombeau!”\r\n\r\nAnd yet to-morrow was, for good or bad, for better for worse, a favourite\r\nphrase with Napoleon. His last words to Murat at nightfall, in the hope\r\nof battle with the Russians on the Dwina next day, were, “To-morrow, at\r\nfive, the sun of Austerlitz!” After the combat of Reichenbach, which lost\r\nhim Duroc, he sat alone, in moody meditation, neither speaking nor to be\r\nspoken with; appealed to in vain for orders by Caulaincourt and Maret:\r\n“To-morrow—everything,” was the only answer their most urgent demands\r\ncould wring from him, in his hour of dejection and theirs of need. In\r\nanother mood was the emperor when, after Leipsic, he pressed the Austrian\r\ncabinet to side with him, and at once. If they were wise, he said, they\r\nwould do so forthwith. They could do so, he told their representative,\r\nthat evening. To-morrow it might perhaps be too late; for who could\r\nforetell the events of to-morrow?\r\n\r\nSo thought Sunderland, in that “agony of terror,” almost over-wrought\r\nor over-coloured, perhaps, by Macaulay, which impelled him to resign\r\noffice, in a sort of frenzied haste. He had asked some of his friends to\r\ncome to his house that he might consult them; they came at the appointed\r\ntime, but found that he had gone to Kensington, and had left word that he\r\nshould soon be back. When he joined them, they observed that he had not\r\nthe gold key which is the badge of the Lord Chamberlain, and asked where\r\nit was. “At Kensington,” answered Sunderland. They found that he had\r\ntendered his resignation, and that it had been, after a long struggle,\r\naccepted. They blamed his haste, and told him that since he had summoned\r\nthem to advise him on that day, he might at least have waited till the\r\nmorrow. “To-morrow,” he exclaimed “would have ruined me. To-night has\r\nsaved me.”\r\n\r\nA signal contrast the despairing minister presents to the poet’s picture\r\nof credulous hope which ever promises a morrow better than to-day (like\r\nthe voluptuaries branded by the Hebrew prophet, who hug themselves in the\r\nassurance that To-morrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant):\r\n\r\n                            ... “Credula vitam\r\n    Spes fovet, ac melius cras fore semper ait.”\r\n\r\nThey say that To-morrow never comes. The great Greek father with the\r\ngolden mouth seems to have based an ethical warning on this thought,\r\nwhen he bids us defer not till to-morrow, for to-morrow is a vanishing\r\nquantity. Μὴ εἰς τὴν αὔριον ἀναβάλλου· ἡ γὰρ αὔριον οὐδέ ποτε λαμβάνει\r\nτέγος. The moral is one with that of the Latin satirist—though _he_ makes\r\nto-morrow come fast enough, one _per diem_,—and go quite as fast as it\r\ncame:\r\n\r\n                      ... “Cum lux altera venit,\r\n    Jam cras hesternum consumpsimus; ecce aliud cras\r\n    Egerit hys annos.”\r\n\r\nMatter-of-fact people will tell you that To-morrow does come, and fix\r\nby their stop-watch the instant of its arrival. Nay, they can appeal to\r\nthe _primus inter poetas_ for poetical verification of their view. Says\r\nthe Messenger to the Provost, while it is yet dark, on the morning which\r\nis appointed to be Claudio’s last, “Good morrow; for, as I take it, it\r\nis almost day.” And so with the peers who enter sleepless King Henry’s\r\nchamber, at the hour they name:\r\n\r\n    “_Warwick._ Many good morrows to your majesty.\r\n\r\n    _K. Hen._ Is it good morrow, lords?\r\n\r\n    _War._ ’Tis one o’clock, and past.\r\n\r\n    _K. Hen._ Why then, good morrow to you all, my lords.”\r\n\r\nBut, in its own sense, the saying holds good, and is good sense too,\r\nthat To-morrow never comes. One might take for emblem of its import the\r\ntouching story told by Southey, of a lady on the point of marriage, whose\r\naffianced husband usually travelled by the stage-coach to visit her, and\r\nwho, going one day to meet him, found instead of her betrothed an old\r\nfriend, despatched to announce to her his sudden death. She uttered a\r\nscream, and piteously exclaimed, “He is dead!” But then all consciousness\r\nof the affliction that had befallen her ceased. From that fatal moment\r\nshe had daily, for fifty years, at the time Dr. Uwins wrote, and “in all\r\nseasons, traversed the distance of a few miles, where she expected her\r\nfuture husband to alight from the coach; and every day [adds the doctor,\r\nwriting in the then present tense] she utters in a plaintive tone, “He is\r\nnot come yet! I will return to-morrow.” _To-morrow, and to-morrow, and\r\nto-morrow_—that to her never was, but always was to be.\r\n\r\nWhy, and how, To-morrow never comes, might be discussed in a strain of\r\ntranscendental metaphysics. Mr. Carlyle, in a memorable chapter headed\r\nNatural Supernaturalism, expounds in his mystic suggestive way the\r\nphilosophic thesis, that Time and Space are but creations of God,—with\r\nwhom as it is a universal HERE, so it is an everlasting Now. And as\r\nregards Man: is the Past annihilated, or only past? is the Future\r\nnon-extant, or only future? “The curtains of Yesterday drop down, and the\r\ncurtains of To-morrow roll up; but Yesterday and To-morrow both _are_.\r\nPierce through the Time-element, glance into the Eternal.”\r\n\r\nIt is but a glance the strongest eye can take, in that direction. But\r\neven a glance may secure a glimpse of things which filmy, unpurged,\r\ndownlooking eye hath not seen, nor ear heard—for they seem to involve\r\nunspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter. To-morrow\r\nthou hast never seen; to thee it has never come. But it shall come.\r\nAnd it that shall come, will come; and will not tarry. Wait the great\r\nteacher, Death. _CRAS iterabimus æquor_: to-morrow we shall be sounding\r\nour dim and perilous way across the dark waters of that fathomless sea.\r\nIf the prospect appals, happy he that can adapt to his own hopes, in\r\nserenest confidence, yet eager anticipation,—as he speculates on what a\r\nday, and the Better Land, may bring forth: To-morrow, to fresh woods and\r\npastures new.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE DIVINE AUTHORSHIP OF ORDER._\r\n\r\n1 CORINTHIANS xiv. 33, 40.\r\n\r\n\r\nPractically, the amount of confusion prevalent in the church of Corinth,\r\narising from irregularities incident to the exercise of “tongues,”\r\nand to the undisciplined energies of a mixed congregation, appears to\r\nhave almost rivalled the disorder in the theatre of Ephesus, when the\r\nwhole city was filled with confusion, and some cried one thing, and\r\nsome another; for the assembly was confused, and the most part knew\r\nnot wherefore they were come together. So, when the whole church of\r\nCorinth were come together into one place, and all spoke with tongues,\r\nto outsiders that for the nonce stepped inside they must appear mad. All\r\nthings were done indecorously and in most admired disorder. Now, St. Paul\r\nwas for having all things done decently and in order. “For God is not the\r\nauthor of confusion, but of peace.” Order is Heaven’s first law. The same\r\napostle is prompt to remind the Thessalonians that he behaved himself not\r\ndisorderly among them; and this he did because he heard that there were\r\nsome among them which walked disorderly—ἀτάκτως. The apostolic canon for\r\nboth Corinth and Thessalonica, and all other churches, is, Πὰντα δὲ κατὰ\r\nτάξιν γινέσθω. Let them all walk by this same rule, and all mind this\r\nsame thing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs with the sect of Pythagoreans, virtue was defined to be a harmony,\r\nunity, and an endeavour to resemble the Deity,—so the whole life of man,\r\nthey taught, should be an attempt to represent on earth the beauty and\r\nharmony displayed in the order of the universe. It was the doctrine of\r\nPythagoras himself, that by action as well as by thought the individual\r\nas well as the state should represent in themselves “an image of the\r\norder and harmony by which the world was sustained and regulated.” But as\r\nPrior puts it, when he considers the heavens, the starry worlds of God’s\r\nordaining, or ordering,—\r\n\r\n    “How mean the order and perfection sought\r\n    In the best product of the human thought,\r\n    Compared to the great harmony that reigns\r\n    In what the Spirit of the world ordains!”\r\n\r\nLord Lytton suggestively pictures to us one of his characters alone in\r\nthe streets by night, striding noiselessly on, under the gaslights, under\r\nthe stars; gaslights primly marshalled at equidistance; stars that seem\r\nto the naked eye dotted over space without symmetry or method—“Man’s\r\norder, near and finite, is so distinct; the Maker’s order, remote,\r\ninfinite, is so beyond man’s comprehension of what _is_ order.” Chauncy\r\nHare Townshend expresses the same idea in an address to the stars:—\r\n\r\n    “Distance deceives the sight. Ye move and sway\r\n    With life; yet are your hoverings on the brink\r\n    Of ruin but the freedom and the play\r\n    That binds your dance of beauty, link to link,\r\n    In woven joy that shall not fail nor shrink.\r\n                  ... Thrones arise and sink,\r\n    Earth is transformed beneath you: ye remain,\r\n    Clasping distracted man with Order’s sacred chain.”\r\n\r\nSo Wordsworth, addressing as it were a deified idea of Duty, pays this\r\nhomage:—\r\n\r\n              ... “Thou dost preserve the stars from wrong,\r\n    And the most ancient heavens through Thee are fresh and strong.”\r\n\r\nWell may Hooker speculate on what would become of man, were Nature to\r\nintermit her course, and leave altogether, though but for a while, the\r\nobservation of her own laws; if the frame of that heavenly arch erected\r\nover our heads should loosen and dissolve itself; if celestial spheres\r\nshould forget their wonted motions, and by irregular volubility turn\r\nthemselves any way as it might happen; if the prince of the lights of\r\nheaven, which now as a giant doth run his unwearied course, should, as it\r\nwere through a languishing faintness, begin to stand and rest himself;\r\nif the moon should wander from her beaten way, the times and seasons of\r\nthe year blend themselves by disordered and confused mixture—“See we not\r\nplainly that obedience of creatures unto the law of Nature is the stay\r\nof the whole world?” Again to quote from “The Mystery of Evil,” the same\r\nstar-gazer speaking:—\r\n\r\n    “Do I not climb in you, O blessèd host,\r\n      The way of symbols, shining steps to God?\r\n    When most man knows you, he is certain most\r\n      One law unswerving reigns from star to clod.”\r\n\r\n“Of law,” says Hooker, at the close of his first book of Ecclesiastical\r\nPolity, with an eloquence which has ever been most admired by the\r\nmost admirable masters of English prose,—“Of law there can be no less\r\nacknowledged, than that her seat is the bosom of God, her voice the\r\nharmony of the world; all things in heaven and earth do her homage, the\r\nvery least as feeling her care, and the greatest as not exempted from\r\nher power: both angels and men, and creatures of what condition soever,\r\nthough each in different sort and manner, yet all with uniform consent,\r\nadmiring her as the mother of their peace and joy.” Considering when he\r\nwrote, what he wrote, and to what purpose and in what spirit he wrote,\r\nthere seems to us a beautiful consistency in Richard Hooker’s deathbed\r\nmeditations, as related in the familiar memoir by Izaak Walton. Found\r\nby his trustiest visitor, “deep in contemplation, and not inclinable to\r\ndiscourse,” and asked what was the subject of his present thoughts, he\r\nreplied, “That he was meditating the number and nature of angels, and\r\ntheir blessed obedience and order, without which, peace could not be in\r\nheaven; and oh, that it might be so on earth!”\r\n\r\nThere is not, affirms a modern divine, a corner of the world, nor\r\na process of nature, nor a piece of God’s handiwork of any kind\r\nwhatever, on which His love of order is not written with a plainness\r\nnot to be mistaken. “System and method, law and order, symmetry and\r\npunctuality, are conspicuous everywhere; indicating at once the value\r\nattached to these things in the mind of God, and his dislike for their\r\nopposites—confusion, fitfulness, irregularity.” Nor is the Divine love of\r\norder a quality that ever leads to stiffness, formality, or monotony; for\r\nit is shown to be constantly associated with beauty, variety, and freedom.\r\n\r\nM. Jules Simon interpolates into his argument for the vast preponderance\r\nof good over evil in the world, a casually expressed identification of\r\ngood with order: “le bien, c’est-à-dire, l’ordre, car dans le monde le\r\nbien et l’ordre ne font qu’un.”\r\n\r\n    “Some think Disorder means God’s moral plan;\r\n      But Evil oscillates in certain bounds.\r\n    Ten thousand causes check the rage of man:\r\n      His utmost crimes a wall of brass surrounds;\r\n      Mere weariness exhausts War’s yelling hounds;\r\n    And, if all fail, Death comes with his great wave,\r\n      That levels all the hollows and the mounds\r\n    Of human life. Who then shall be so brave\r\n    As of Confusion found in God’s large thoughts to rave?”\r\n\r\nReaders familiar with the writings first and last of Mr. Carlyle, will\r\nreadily call to mind many a terse utterance in vindication of the Divine\r\nauthorship and Divine authority of order. _Dis_order he pronounces to be\r\na thing which “veracious created Nature, even because it is not Chaos and\r\na waste-whirling baseless Phantasm,” rejects and disowns. “_Dis_order,\r\ninsane by the nature of it, is the hatefullest of things to man, who\r\nlives by sanity and by order.” “All Anarchy, all evil, all injustice,\r\nis, by the nature of it, ... suicidal, and cannot endure.” “Arrangement\r\nis indispensable to man; Arrangement, were it grounded only on that old\r\nprimary evangel of Force, with Sceptre in the shape of Hammer!” Such\r\nsentences admit of almost infinite multiplication. “Anarchy, hateful as\r\nDeath, is abhorrent to the whole nature of man; and so must itself soon\r\ndie.” Hence this philosopher’s partiality for “heroes,” even of the least\r\nestimable type, provided they have will and force to replace confusion\r\nby order. Cortès is not among the specified Heroes of his special\r\nHero-worship; but he deserves a place by reason of the preamble to that\r\ncode of ordinances, as the conqueror of Mexico himself terms them, which\r\nhe set forth in restraint of his army: the essential purport of this\r\npreamble being, that in all institutions, whether Divine or human (if the\r\nlatter have any worth), order is the great law.\r\n\r\nIt was in support of the cause of social order that Luther took to\r\nexposing the dangers due to ignorant innovators, and strenuously declared\r\nthat “God Himself constituted certain authorities to direct the world;\r\nfor it is a great feature in His magnificent system, that there shall be\r\norder here below.” Doctor Martin may, in this respect, be called a man\r\nafter our Hero-worshipper’s own heart; such another as the one of whom\r\nhe wrote,—“Wheresoever Disorder may stand or lie, let it have a care;\r\nhere is the man that has declared war with it, that will never make peace\r\nwith it. Man is the Missionary of Order; he is the servant, not of the\r\nDevil and of Chaos, but of God and the universe.” And Christian doctrine\r\nteaches that the order and beauty of the outward world are symbols of\r\nthat inward order and symmetry, that peace and purity of heart, that\r\nuniversal harmony between God’s will and man’s will, which it is one\r\ngreat object of Christianity to establish.\r\n\r\n    “Then quick I ran my glance about the globe,\r\n    To find Religion link’d with Order’s aim,\r\n    Ruling by love and light,”\r\n\r\nsays the Christian poet, who has, however, to deplore the disappointments\r\nof his quest. Of all orderly things that are beautiful in God’s eyes, it\r\nhas been said, there can be none so beautiful as an orderly or holy soul.\r\n“Once in this world the sight presented itself in spotless beauty and\r\nbrilliancy.” Everything there seen was in its place: reason, conscience,\r\nwill, feeling, instinct, appetite, “all most beautifully arranged; each\r\nwas in perfect health, and all were in thorough harmony with the will of\r\nGod.” But that was God manifest in the flesh. Order incarnate. Without\r\nHim, in the material world, was not anything made that was made. Apart\r\nfrom Him, the moral world is without form and void, and darkness covers\r\nthe face of its deep. Order, in fine, is the indispensable postulate of\r\nevery given cosmos. In the words of Schiller—\r\n\r\n    “It is the keystone of the world’s wide arch;\r\n    The one sustaining and sustained by all,\r\n    Which, if it fall, brings all in ruin down.”\r\n\r\nOf the Church as a family, George Herbert, ever quaint in his devotion,\r\nsings or says—after a depreciation of his own unruly thoughts:\r\n\r\n    “But, Lord, the house and family are Thine,\r\n    Though some of them repine.\r\n    Turn out these wranglers, which defile Thy seat:\r\n    For where Thou dwellest all is neat.\r\n\r\n    “First Peace and Silence all disputes control,\r\n    Then _Order_ plays the soul;\r\n    And giving all things their set forms and hours,\r\n    Makes of wild woods sweet walks and bowers.”\r\n\r\nSo Dryden traces to harmony this universal frame—a cosmos evolved from\r\nchaos, from a heap of jarring atoms that, at the Divine summons,—\r\n\r\n    “_In order_ to their stations leap.”\r\n\r\nShaftesbury contends that the admiration and love of order, in whatever\r\nkind, is “naturally improving to the temper, advantageous to social\r\naffection, and highly assistant to virtue—which is itself no other than\r\nthe love of order and beauty in society.” In the meanest subjects of the\r\nworld, he goes on to say, the appearance of order gains upon the mind,\r\nand draws the affections towards it. “For ’tis impossible that such a\r\nDivine order should be contemplated without ecstasy and rapture; since\r\nin the common subjects of science, and the liberal arts, whatever is\r\naccording to just harmony and proportion is so transporting to those\r\nwho have any knowledge or practice in the kind.” In another place he\r\nelaborates the thesis, that whatever things have order, have unity of\r\ndesign, and concur in one, and are parts constituent of one whole—just as\r\na symphony is a certain system of proportioned sounds. It is noteworthy\r\nthat Pythagoras deduced his celebrated theory of the music of the\r\nspheres from his assumption that everything in the great arrangement\r\n(κόσμος) which he called the world must be harmoniously arranged (and\r\nthat, accordingly, the planets were at the same relative distance as the\r\ndivisions of the monochord, etc.) Divine as the philosophy of Plato is\r\ncommonly esteemed, there are, on the other hand, occasional glimpses in\r\nit of what one of his commentators calls the “appalling doctrine” that\r\nGod alternately governs and forsakes the world—the world when he forsakes\r\nit, suddenly changing its orbit, so that all things are in disorder, and\r\nmundane existence is totally disarranged: “only after some time do things\r\nsettle down to a sort of order, though of a very imperfect kind.” Spinoza\r\ntakes order to be a thing of the imagination, as also he does right and\r\nwrong, useful and hurtful—these being merely such, he argues, in relation\r\nto us. But this would not prevent him, from his stand-point, assenting to\r\nthe ethical import of order—as expounded for instance by the Shakspearian\r\nUlysses:\r\n\r\n    “The heavens themselves, the planets, and this centre,\r\n    Observe degree, priority, and place, ...\r\n    Office, and custom, in all line of order....\r\n    Take but degree away, untune that string,\r\n    And hark, what discord follows! each thing meets\r\n    In mere oppugnancy.”\r\n\r\nOrder, writes Southey, is the sanity of the mind, the health of the body,\r\nthe peace of the city, the security of the State. Diogenes held with the\r\nDorian lawgivers, that order (κόσμος) is the basis of civil government.\r\nAs the beams to a house, it has been said, as the bones to the microcosm\r\nof man, so is order to all things. Balzac is treating of _harmonie\r\npolitique_ when he says that harmony is the poetry of order, and that\r\n“the peoples” have a keen need of order. The racy author of the “Biglow\r\nPapers” discourses in his shrewd, homely style, on the indispensableness\r\n(not that he uses such a word) of orderly established law:—\r\n\r\n    “Onsettle _that_, an’ all the world goes whiz,\r\n    A screw is loose in everything there is.”\r\n\r\nMr. Carlyle, in his apology for Knox in the act of pulling down\r\ncathedrals—as if he were a seditious rioting demagogue—urges that he was\r\nprecisely the reverse of that. Knox, he maintains, wanted no pulling down\r\nof stone edifices, but wanted leprosy and darkness to be thrown out of\r\nthe lives of men. “Tumult was not his element; it was the tragic feature\r\nof his life that he was forced to dwell so much on that.” Every such man,\r\non Mr. Carlyle’s showing, is the born enemy of disorder—hates to be in\r\nit; but what then? “Smooth falsehood is not order; it is the general sum\r\ntotal of disorder. Order is truth—each thing standing on the basis that\r\nbelongs to it. Order and falsehood cannot subsist together.” And it is\r\nin treating of another of his heroes elect, that the same philosopher\r\ncontends on behalf of such others of them as seem to have worked as\r\nrevolutionary men, that nevertheless every great man, every genuine\r\nman, is by the nature of him a son of order, not of disorder—a seeming\r\nanarchist, yet to his whole soul anarchy is hostile, hateful. “His\r\nmission is Order; every man’s is. He is here to make what was disorderly,\r\nchaotic, into a thing ruled, regular. He is the missionary of Order.” Is\r\nnot all work of man in this world, we are emphatically asked, a making of\r\nOrder?\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Duval, writing to Mme. Récamier, as her spiritual counsellor,\r\nbids her engrave this elementary truth on her heart of hearts: “Gravez\r\nau-dedans de vous-même cette première vérité que la religion veut\r\n_l’ordre_ avant tout.” Whatsoever doth make manifest is light, and it\r\nis light that reveals a cosmos where before, in the words of Thomson, a\r\nformless grey confusion covered all:—\r\n\r\n    “As when of old (so sung the Hebrew bard)\r\n    Light, uncollected, through the chaos urged\r\n    Its infant way; nor Order yet had drawn\r\n    His lovely train from out the dubious gloom.”\r\n\r\nThat a scrupulous regard for order, in some sort, is nevertheless\r\ncompatible with a very low standard of moral worth, is recognised and\r\nillustrated by poet Crabbe—prose-poet the good parson was, not quite in\r\nthe accepted sense—in a series of pithy, if not pungent rhymes:—\r\n\r\n    “The love of order—I the thing receive\r\n    From reverend men, and I in part believe—\r\n    Shows a clear mind and clean, and whoso needs\r\n    This love, but seldom in the world succeeds;\r\n    And yet with this some other love must be,\r\n    Ere I can fully to the fact agree;\r\n    Valour and study may by order gain,\r\n    By order sovereigns hold more steady reign;\r\n    Through all the tribes of nature order runs,\r\n    And rules around in systems and in suns:\r\n    Still has the love of order found a place\r\n    With all that’s low, degrading, mean, and base,\r\n    With all that merits scorn, and all that meets disgrace:\r\n    In the cold miser, of all change afraid,\r\n    In pompous men in public seats obeyed;\r\n    In humble placemen, heralds, solemn drones;\r\n    ...\r\n    Order to these is armour and defence,\r\n    And love of method serves in lack of sense.”\r\n\r\nExceptions allowed for, as in every rule, yet is the rule sufficiently\r\napproved, that order is heaven’s first law. The poet of “The Angel in\r\nthe House” in style, and spirit, and sentiment, how salient a contrast\r\nto Crabbe, utters the conceit (_poeticè_) in one of his tender preludes,\r\nthat—\r\n\r\n    “Sweet Order has its draught of bliss\r\n    Graced with the pearl of God’s consent,”—\r\n\r\na conceit that allows of wide application, as do many of those of so\r\nsuggestive a writer.\r\n\r\nBut to conclude. When the judicious Hooker—to call him by his\r\nconventional epithet—lay a-dying, he expressed his joy at the near\r\nprospect of entering a World of Order. The author of “The Book of the\r\nChurch” emphasises the import of holy Richard’s “placid and profound\r\ncontentment,” by reminding us that because he had been employed in\r\necclesiastical polemics, and because his life had been passed under the\r\nperpetual discomfort of domestic discord, the happiness of heaven must\r\nhave seemed in Hooker’s estimation, to consist primarily in Order, as,\r\nindeed, in all human societies this is the first thing needful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_SWEET SLEEP, AND ITS FORFEITURE._\r\n\r\nPROVERBS iii. 24.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo him that keepeth sound wisdom and instruction is the promise given,\r\nnot only that he shall walk in his way safely, and his foot shall not\r\nstumble,—this for daytime and its activities,—but further, as regards\r\nnight-time and its contingencies, that when he lies down he shall not\r\nbe afraid; yea, he shall lie down, and his sleep shall be sweet. So He\r\ngiveth His beloved sleep, of whom the Psalmist said, “I laid me down and\r\nslept; I awaked; for the Lord sustained me.” Surely, in order that one\r\nmay pray with full purpose of heart the prayer, Let me die the death of\r\nthe righteous, and let my last end be like his! one should live the life\r\nthat may warrant the nightly petition, Let me sleep the sleep of the\r\njust, and let mine eyes close quietly in slumber even as his.\r\n\r\nMacbeth, within this minute a murderer, _ipso facto_ realizes the\r\nappalling truth, that between him and placid sleep there is, from\r\nhenceforth and for evermore, a great gulf fixed, as impassable as abysmal.\r\n\r\n    “Methought I heard a voice cry, ‘Sleep no more!\r\n    Macbeth does murder sleep, the innocent sleep;\r\n    Sleep, that knits up the ravell’d sleave of care,\r\n    The death of each day’s life, sore labour’s bath,\r\n    Balm of hurt minds, great nature’s second course,\r\n    Chief nourisher in life’s feast,⸺’\r\n\r\n    _Lady M._              What do you mean?\r\n\r\n    _Macb._ Still it cried, ‘Sleep no more!’ to all the house:\r\n    ‘Glamis hath murder’d sleep; and therefore Cawdor\r\n    Shall sleep no more. Macbeth shall sleep no more!’”\r\n\r\nHow sleeps Lady Macbeth after that night? Ask her physician and\r\nwaiting-woman, and watch with them the sleep-walking scene. “To bed,\r\nto bed, to bed.” But what avails _that_ to the somnambulist, ever in\r\nsemblance washing her hands, and complaining of the smell of blood\r\nupon them still, and that all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten\r\nthem? Now and then one meets with a sceptic as to lost sleep being the\r\ninevitable sequent upon crime; and no doubt there are exceptions. Mr.\r\nG. Wingrove Cooke, in his letters from Chinese waters, thus describes\r\nthe captive Mandarin, Yeh, whose fellow-passenger to Calcutta he was:\r\n“He goes to bed at eight o’clock, and while we are reading or writing\r\nor playing chess, he sleeps the sleep of infancy—an unbroken slumber,\r\napparently undisturbed by visions of widowed women and wailing orphans.\r\nThis man-killer, after slaying his hundred thousand human beings, enjoys\r\nsweeter sleep than an innocent London alderman after a turtle dinner.”\r\nPerhaps that is not saying much,—considering what a turtle dinner\r\ncomprehends and superinduces. But the next sentence says a good deal; it\r\nis to be hoped, a great deal too much: “So false are traditions; so false\r\nare the remorseful scenes of Greek and English tragedies.” One would be\r\nsorry, for the dignity of human nature, to believe that all is fiction\r\nthe poets tell us of cases in which _non avium citharæque cantus_, or any\r\nother aids and appliances, _somnum reducent_. “Wherefore to me,” asks\r\nClytemnestra,—\r\n\r\n          ... “is solacing sleep denied?\r\n    And honourable rest, the right of all?\r\n    So that no medicine of the slumbrous shell,\r\n    Brimmed with divinest draughts of melody,\r\n    Nor silence under dreamful canopies,\r\n    Nor purple cushions of the lofty couch,\r\n    May lull this fever for a little while.”\r\n\r\nImpressive in history, not romance, as Plutarch tells it, is the story of\r\nPausanius as a haunted man, from the hour that Cleonice fell dead at his\r\nfeet, pierced by his sword. “From that hour he could rest no more.” Her\r\nspectre perturbed him every night. Henceforth, nor poppy, nor mandragora,\r\nnor all the drowsy syrups of the world, could ever medicine him to that\r\nsweet sleep which he owed yesterday. As a guilty spirit says of guilt, in\r\none of Landor’s fragments,—\r\n\r\n    “It wakes me many mornings, many nights,\r\n    And fields of poppies could not quiet it.”\r\n\r\nModern fiction abounds with examples to the purpose. There is Colonel\r\nWhyte Melville’s remorseful woman of the world bidding her young friend\r\ngood night, and meaning it all the more because her own good nights are\r\ndead and gone: “What would I give to yawn as honestly as you do, and to\r\nsleep sound once again, as I used to sleep when I was a girl!” There is\r\nMr. Trollope’s Lady Mason, so wistfully, so vainly longing for rest—to be\r\nable to lay aside the terrible fatigue of being ever on the watch. From\r\nthe burden of that necessity she has never been free since her crime was\r\nfirst committed. “She had never known true rest. She had not once trusted\r\nherself to sleep without the feeling that her first waking thought would\r\nbe one of horror, as the remembrance of her position came upon her.” As\r\nwith the royal lady pictured by the laureate,—\r\n\r\n                    “Many a time for hours\r\n    In the dead night, grim faces came and went\r\n    Before her, or a vague spiritual fear—\r\n    Like to some doubtful noise of creaking doors,\r\n    Heard by the watcher in a haunted house,\r\n    That keeps the rust of murder on the walls—\r\n    Held her awake. Or if she slept, she dream’d\r\n    An awful dream ...\r\n                ... and with a cry she woke.\r\n    And all this trouble did not pass, but grew.”\r\n\r\nThere is Donatello, in Hawthorne’s “Transformation,” succumbing to a\r\nstupor, which he mistakes for such drowsiness as he has known in his\r\ninnocent past life. There is Albert Maurice, in “Mary of Burgundy,”\r\ngazing on the Vert Gallant of Hannut as he lay in a deep, sweet sleep—so\r\ncalm and tranquil, though within the walls of a prison, suffering from\r\ninjuries, and exposed to constant danger; gazing with a sense of envy and\r\nregret, “which few, perhaps, can appreciate fully, who have not felt\r\nthe sharp tooth of remorse begin its sleepless gnawings on the heart. He\r\nwould not have disturbed such slumbers for the world; and, withdrawing\r\nagain with a noiseless step, he retired to his own chamber, and cast\r\nhimself down upon his bed, to snatch, at least, that heated and disturbed\r\nsleep, which was all the repose that he was ever more to know on earth.”\r\nTo such as him can nothing bring back, in the hour and power of darkness,\r\nmore than an embittered memory of times\r\n\r\n    “When that placid sleep came o’er him\r\n    Which he ne’er can know again.”\r\n\r\nAn innocent comforter in a modern tragedy offers a disquieted spirit the\r\nassurance, as regards the object of his disquiet, that “’twill away in\r\nsleep.” But his answer is,—\r\n\r\n    “No, no! I dare not sleep—for well I know\r\n    That then the knife will gleam, the blood will gush,\r\n    The form will stiffen!”\r\n\r\nFrom the night of the massacre of Glencoe, Glenlyon, as Macaulay tells\r\nus, was never again the man that he had been before that night. The\r\nform of his countenance was changed; and “in all places, at all hours,\r\nwhether he waked or slept, Glencoe was for ever before him.” As with a\r\ndistinguished foreigner of a later generation, _Depuis ce moment, point\r\nde sommeil, point de repos; il croyait toujours voir un glaive arrêté sur\r\nsa tête_. In such cases, the sleepers start from broken slumbers, as if\r\nstarting back from the edge of a precipice; for,—\r\n\r\n    “Their whole tranquillity of heart is gone;\r\n    The peace wherewith till now they have been blest\r\n    Hath taken its departure. In the breast\r\n    Fast following thoughts and busy fancies throng;\r\n    Their sleep itself is feverish, and possest\r\n    With dreams that to the wakeful mind belong.”\r\n\r\n“Something like a stupid sleep oppresses me,” writes one of Henry\r\nMackenzie’s characters; “last night I could not sleep. Where are now\r\nthose luxurious slumbers, those wandering dreams of future happiness?\r\nNever shall I know them again.” Falkland avows to Caleb Williams, the\r\ninvoluntary master of his master’s fatal secret, that “from the hour the\r\ncrime was committed” he has not had an hour’s peace: “I became changed\r\nfrom the happiest into the most miserable being that lives; sleep has\r\nfled from my eyes.” And Caleb Williams himself testifies in an after\r\nchapter, “The ease and light-heartedness of my youth were for ever gone.\r\nThe voice of an irresistible necessity had commanded me to ‘sleep no\r\nmore.’” They that do murder, says Roscoe’s Violenzia,—\r\n\r\n    “Never sleep more, never more taste of peace,\r\n    Quaff poison in their drink, see knives in the dark,\r\n    And ever at their elbow horror walks,\r\n    Shaking them like a palsy.”\r\n\r\nThe bitter contrast—ah, for the change ’twixt now and then!—is forcibly\r\nworded by Bosola in the “Duchess of Malfi”:—\r\n\r\n    “O sacred innocence, that sweetly sleeps\r\n    On turtle’s feathers! whilst a guilty conscience\r\n    Is a perspective that foreshows us hell.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_ONCE DENIED, THRICE DENIED._\r\n\r\nST. MATTHEW xxvi, 69, _sq._\r\n\r\n\r\nLie engenders lie. Once committed, the liar has to go on in his course of\r\nlying. It is the penalty of his transgression, or one of the penalties.\r\nTo the habitual liar, bronzed and hardened in the custom, till custom\r\nbecomes second nature, the penalty may seem no very terrible price\r\nto pay. To him, on the other hand, who, without deliberate intent,\r\nand against his innermost will, is overtaken with such a fault, the\r\ngenerative power of a first lie to beget others, the necessity of\r\nsupporting the first by a second and a third, is a retribution keenly to\r\nbe felt, while penitently owned to be most just.\r\n\r\nThough it was afar off that Peter followed his Master to the\r\nhigh-priest’s house, yet he did follow; and, we may be sure, with little\r\nthought, and still less intention, of denying Him even once. But as he\r\nsat by the fire and warmed himself, the identification of him by a\r\ncertain maid as certainly a disciple of Christ was boldly met by the\r\naffirmation, or negation, “Woman, I know Him not.” The lie was uttered;\r\nthe winged word of falsehood was on its way. And there an end, he\r\nperhaps hoped. But after a little while, another bystander recognised\r\nhim, and asserted the damaging recognition, “Thou art also of them.”\r\nAnother denial was the consequence: “Man, I am not.” An hour passed\r\naway, and Peter, in sullen misery and bewilderment, self-consciously an\r\nabject coward and confirmed liar, had to deny for the third time Him he\r\nhad denied once and again. “Of a truth,” affirmed another of the mixed\r\ncompany, “this fellow also was with Him; for he is a Galilean.” And\r\nPeter said, “Man, I know not what thou sayest.” And then the cock crew.\r\nAnd then the Lord turned and looked upon Peter. And at that look—so\r\nupbraidingly expressive, so pathetically recalling recent protestations\r\nof unfaltering allegiance, and the concurrent prediction of lapse and\r\nabandonment—what could Peter do, but with shame and confusion of face,\r\nand with a heart full to bursting, go out, and weep bitterly.\r\n\r\nWhen he thought thereon, he wept: thought of the Master’s look, that\r\nrecalled to him the vehement assurance of loyalty met by the foretelling\r\nof his fall. Thought, too, of the graduation of his denials; a first\r\ninvolving a second, and the second exacting yet a third. The third was\r\nthe cost of the first. He had not counted the cost then. He had to pay it\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nIt was part of the prophet’s burden of woes against the doomed city, that\r\nshe had “wearied herself with lies.” Easily uttered, they may multiply\r\nat a rate to trouble the teller of them, and weary him, if only with\r\nthe necessity of inventing new ones to back the old. He must ever be\r\ndevising fresh vouchers for his impaired and imperilled credit. He must\r\ncontinually be endorsing his forged notes, and forging fresh ones that\r\nwill stand inspection. _Fallacia alia aliam trudit._ And this is weary\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n    “En quel gouffre de soins et de perplexité\r\n    Nous jette une action faite sans equité.”\r\n\r\nAnd as with actions, so with words. The same speaker of the foregoing\r\ncouplet utters elsewhere the lament,—\r\n\r\n    “Ma fourbe est découverte. Oh! que la vérité\r\n    Se peut cacher longtemps avec difficulté!”\r\n\r\nSo we read in Molière. And Corneille has a play (not original) entirely\r\ndevoted to the illustration of this subject, showing _qu’il faut bonne\r\nmémoire acrès qu’on a menti_; the Menteur κατ’ ἐξοχὴν, being one who\r\n_entasse fourbe sur fourbe_, and is constrained by the law of his nature,\r\nat least of habit, which is second nature, to be ever adding to the\r\nheap of lies to which he has committed himself. A Spanish proverb—and\r\n_Le Menteur_ is from the Spanish—declares that “for an honest man half\r\nhis wits is enough, while the whole are too little for a knave;” the\r\nways, that is, as Archbishop Trench expounds the adage, of truth and\r\nuprightness are so simple and plain, that a little wit is abundantly\r\nsufficient for those who walk in them; whereas the ways of falsehood and\r\nfraud are so perplexed and tangled, that sooner or later all the wit of\r\nthe cleverest rogue will not preserve him from being entangled therein—a\r\ntruth often and wonderfully confirmed in the lives of evil men.\r\n\r\nAmong the aphorisms of Dean Swift we read: “He who tells a lie is not\r\nsensible how great a task he undertakes; for he must be forced to invent\r\ntwenty more to maintain that one.”\r\n\r\nIt has been called the severe, but appropriate, punishment of historians\r\nwho desert the paths of truth for those of paradox, to be compelled to\r\ndefend the falsehood to which they have committed themselves against the\r\never-accumulating evidences of the truth. Mr. Robertson, of Brighton,\r\nfeelingly sketches the case of one who, being unprepared and accosted\r\nsuddenly, says hastily that which is irreconcileable with strict\r\ntruth; then to substantiate and make it look probable, misrepresents\r\nor invents something else; and so has woven round himself a mesh which\r\nwill entangle his conscience through many a weary day and many a\r\nsleepless night.[31] One burden laid on fault, he goes on to show, is\r\nthat chain of entanglement which seems to drag down to fresh sins. “One\r\nstep necessitates many others. One fault leads to another, and crime to\r\ncrime. The soul gravitates downward beneath its burden. It was profound\r\nknowledge which prophetically refused to limit Peter’s sin to once.\r\n‘Verily I say unto thee ... thou shalt deny me thrice.’”\r\n\r\nMr. Froude shows us Queen Elizabeth stooping to “a deliberate lie.” At\r\ntimes, he says, writing of her embarrassed policy in 1565, she “seemed\r\nto struggle with her ignominy, but it was only to flounder deeper into\r\ndistraction and dishonour.” In October of that year she publicly denied\r\nthat she had encouraged the rebellion in Scotland. In November, we read,\r\n“Never had Elizabeth been in greater danger; and the worst features of\r\nthe peril were the creations of her own untruths.” Again, in May, 1566:\r\n“Meanwhile Elizabeth was reaping a harvest of inconveniences for her\r\nexaggerated demonstrations of friendliness” to the Queen of Scots. Mary\r\ntaking her at her word, “Vainly Elizabeth struggled to extricate herself\r\nfrom her dilemma; resentment was still pursuing her for her treachery\r\nin the past autumn.... She could but shuffle and equivocate in a manner\r\nwhich had become too characteristic.”[32] She was but paying the price of\r\nlies—the being constrained to go on lying still. It is certain, affirms a\r\npopular essayist, that nobody yet ever did anything wrong in this world\r\nwithout having to tell one or more falsehoods to begin with: the embryo\r\nmurderer has to tell a lie about the pistol or dagger, the would-be\r\nsuicide about the poison he purchases; and in fine, “the ways down which\r\nthe bad ship Wickedness slides to a shoreless ocean must be greased with\r\nlies.”[33]\r\n\r\nEnglish reviewers not long since were prompt to recognise in Balzac’s “La\r\nMarâtre,” as revived to Parisian popularity, what they rightly accounted\r\nwonderful, a moral immaculate and beyond reproach. And what is that\r\nmoral? “The necessity of a life of lying as a punishment for the one\r\ngreat lie of a mercenary marriage.” One great lie is put out to interest,\r\nand the interest is compound. One great lie involves a ramification of\r\nothers, great or small, if there be comparatives of magnitude in such\r\nmatters; and memory, if not conscience, is for ever on the stretch. The\r\nsad expedient of renewed issues is a necessity. As with the involved\r\nvictim in one of Crabbe’s Tales:—\r\n\r\n    “Such is his pain, who, by his debt oppress’d,\r\n    Seeks by new bonds a temporary rest.”\r\n\r\nTo another section, and with another starting-point from Holy Writ, may\r\nbe referred some remaining illustrations of the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_LINKED LIES._\r\n\r\nGENESIS xxvii. 19-24.\r\n\r\n\r\nJacob in Esau’s goodly raiment, and his smooth skin overlaid with\r\ngoatskins, was duly prepared for a consistent course of deception.\r\nBut the lie upon lie he had to tell before his end was gained,\r\nmust have sorely tried what of conscience he then had. The primary\r\nfalsehood,—distinctly enounced in answer to his blind sire’s “Who\r\nart thou?” “I am Esau, thy firstborn,” come back from the chase with\r\nthe venison Isaac had desired of his firstborn,—this initial lie had\r\nimmediately to be backed by another. How had he found it so quickly?\r\nThere is something revolting in the style of the unfaltering fabrication\r\nat once ready to hand, “Because the Lord thy God brought it to me.” Then\r\nensued that solution of the old man’s misgivings by a manual examination\r\nof the disguised pretender; it was Esau’s hirsute skin, sure enough,\r\nthough the voice was Jacob’s. But the blessing was given. And even\r\nafter that eventful benediction, the patriarch, with a yet lingering\r\napprehension, renewed the pointed question, in its directest form, “Art\r\nthou my very son Esau?” And Jacob said, “I am.” Lie linked to lie, in a\r\nconcatenation accordingly.\r\n\r\n_Solent mendaces luere pœnas malefici_, says Phædrus: liars usually pay\r\nthe penalty of their guilt. And Mrs. Browning vigorously states one\r\ndistinctive penalty, where she speaks of those who—\r\n\r\n    ... “Pay the price\r\n    Of lies, by being constrained to lie on still.”\r\n\r\nThe author of “Romola” powerfully illustrates in that remarkable book\r\nthe embarrassments involved in one cowardly departure from truth. In\r\nthe chapter headed “Tito’s Dilemma,” the occasion arises for Tito to\r\nfabricate an ingenious lie; an occasion “which circumstance never\r\nfails to beget on tacit falsity.” Many chapters farther on we find him\r\nexperiencing the inexorable law of human souls, that we prepare ourselves\r\nfor sudden deeds by the reiterated choice of good or evil that gradually\r\ndetermines character; and it becomes a question whether all the resources\r\nof lying will save him from being crushed by the consequences of his\r\nhabitual choice. At another juncture we read: “Tito felt more and more\r\nconfidence as he went on; the lie was not so difficult when it was once\r\nbegun; and as the words fell easily from his lips, they gave him a\r\nsense of power such as men feel when they have begun a muscular feat\r\nsuccessfully.” The penalty is enforced a few pages later. “But he had\r\nborrowed from the terrible usurer Falsehood, and the loan had mounted and\r\nmounted with the years, till he belonged to the usurer, body and soul.”\r\nAgain: “To-night he had paid a heavier price than ever to make himself\r\nsafe.”[34]\r\n\r\nIn the American story of “The Gayworthys,” the like moral attaches to the\r\ncourse of one unhappy woman who lets herself slide, half involuntarily,\r\ninto deeper wrong: she holds her peace; she makes herself passive. “Her\r\nvery soul lied to itself in its false, bewildered reasonings; that is\r\nthe inherent retribution of false souls.” There are some acts of folly,\r\nremarks the most popular, probably, of contemporary English penwomen,\r\nwhich carry falsehood and dissimulation at their heels as certainly as\r\nthe shadows which follow us when we walk towards the evening sun; and we\r\nvery rarely swerve from the severe boundary-line of right without being\r\ndragged ever so much farther than we calculated upon across the border.\r\n\r\nCorneille’s celebrated play, “Le Menteur,”—but for reading which Molière\r\nasserts his belief that he would never have written a comedy himself,—is\r\n“conveyed” from a Spanish original, and has itself been Englished by\r\nFielding; the ingenuity of the piece consisting in the manner in which\r\none lie is made to call for another, until their wholesale employer is\r\ninextricably caught in the toils.\r\n\r\n    “This is the curse of every evil deed,—\r\n    That, propagating still, it brings forth evil,”\r\n\r\nlaments the elder Piccolomini, in Schiller’s trilogy. The commission of\r\none wrong, says Owen Feltham, puts a man upon a thousand wrongs, perhaps,\r\nto maintain that one: injury, with injury is defended; and we commit\r\na greater, to maintain a less. “A lie begets a lie, till generations\r\nsucceed.” Mr. Carlyle sternly moralises on the growth of accumulated\r\nfalsities,—“sad opulence descending by inheritance, always at compound\r\ninterest, and always largely increased by fresh acquirement on such\r\nimmensity of standing capital.” One lie, says Owen, must be thatched with\r\nanother, or it will soon rain through.\r\n\r\nBenvenuto Cellini records in his autobiography, the bitter experiences\r\nhe endured in being tempted to lie to the duke, his patron, lest he\r\nshould forfeit the favour of the duchess—he who “was always a lover of\r\ntruth and an enemy to falsehood, being then under a necessity of telling\r\nlies.” “As I had begun to tell lies, I plunged deeper and deeper into the\r\nmire,”—till a very Slough of Despond it became to him.\r\n\r\nFool that he was, exclaims Mr. Trollope, of one of his characters in\r\n“Framley Parsonage:” “A man can always do right, even though he has done\r\nwrong before. But the previous wrong adds so much difficulty to the\r\npath—a difficulty which increases in tremendous ratio, till a man at last\r\nis choked in his struggling, and is drowned beneath the waters.” Mr.\r\nThackeray sermonises to the same effect: “And so, my dear sir, seeing\r\nthat after committing any infraction of the moral laws, you must tell\r\nlies in order to back yourself out of your scrape, let me ask you whether\r\nyou had not better forego the crime, so as to avoid the unavoidable, and\r\nunpleasant, and daily-recurring necessity of the subsequent perjury?” And\r\nthe cleverest character this master of social satire ever drew, confesses\r\nhow it jarred on her to begin telling lies to a confiding, simple friend:\r\n“But that is the misfortune of beginning with this kind of forgery. When\r\none fib becomes due as it were, you must forge another to take up the\r\nold acceptance; and so the stock of your lies in circulation inevitably\r\nmultiplies, and the danger of detection increases every day.”\r\n\r\nJeremy Taylor quaintly says of the devil in the ancient oracles, “When\r\nhe was put to it at his oracles, and durst not tell a downright lie, and\r\nyet knew not what was truth, many times he was put to the most pitiful\r\nshifts, and trifling equivocations, and acts of knavery, which, when they\r\nwere discovered, ... it made him much more contemptible and ridiculous\r\nthan if he had said nothing or confessed his ignorance.”\r\n\r\nA lie has been called a two-edged sword without a hilt, which is sure\r\nto slip and cut the hand that holds it. “After telling one lie, we\r\nare sure to tell another; and usually, after spinning a silly, very\r\ncomplicated, and disgusting web, which entangles and chokes us, we find\r\nout that if we had told the truth, it would have been much the easier and\r\nbetter plan.” Lying is likened, again, to borrowing of money-lenders;\r\nfor the credit which we get by it we have always to pay heavily for;\r\nand at last we find that the interest by far exceeds the principal,\r\nand we get so inextricably involved that we never fully recover. “He\r\nwho tells a lie,” says Pope, “is not sensible how great a task he\r\nundertakes; for he must be forced to invent twenty more to maintain\r\nthat one.” Johnson observes that nobody can live long without knowing\r\nthat falsehoods of convenience or vanity are very lightly uttered, and\r\nwhen once uttered are sullenly supported. He reminds us that Boileau,\r\nwho desired to be thought a rigorous and steady moralist, having told\r\na petty lie to Lewis the Fourteenth, continued it afterwards by false\r\ndates, thinking himself obliged in honour to maintain what, when he said\r\nit, was so well received. Pope himself is taxed with similar mendacity\r\nby Mr. de Quincey, who charges him, on a certain literary question,\r\nwith knowingly “preparing for himself a dire necessity of falsehood....\r\nOnce launched upon such a course, he became pledged and committed to\r\nall the difficulties which it might impose. Desperate necessities would\r\narise, from which nothing but desperate lying and hard swearing could\r\nextricate him.” And at a subsequent stage in the _facilis descensus_\r\nhe is described, rather imaginatively, as feeling, and groaning as he\r\nfelt, that fresh falsehoods were in peremptory demand. “This comes of\r\ntelling lies,” is supposed to be his bitter reflection: “one lie makes a\r\nnecessity for another.”\r\n\r\nThe Leucippus of Beaumont and Fletcher thus admonishes an intimate:—\r\n\r\n    “My sin, Ismenus, has wrought all this ill:\r\n    And I beseech thee to be warned by me,\r\n    And do not lie, if any man should ask thee\r\n    But how thou dost, or what o’clock ’tis now;\r\n    Be sure thou do not lie, make no excuse\r\n    For him that is most near thee; never let\r\n    The most officious falsehood ’scape thy tongue,\r\n    For they above (that are entirely Truth)\r\n    Will make the seed which thou hast sown of lies,\r\n    Yield miseries a thousand-fold\r\n    Upon thine head, as they have done on mine.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A TIME TO WEEP, AND A TIME TO LAUGH._\r\n\r\nECCLESIASTES iii. 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the\r\nsun,—for as Shakspeare words it, “How many things by season seasoned are\r\nto their right praise and true perfection!”—be sure that the Wise King\r\nincludes laughter and weeping in the list. “A time to weep, and a time to\r\nlaugh.” Acquainted with grief, he had also been familiar with merriment.\r\nHe had said in his heart, Go to, now, I will prove thee with mirth; but\r\nthe result was that he said of laughter, It is mad; and of mirth, What\r\ndoeth it?—For all this, he freely recognises a time to laugh, so that one\r\nkeep to the time. So much depends, here, on the due observance of times\r\nand seasons. It is with the frivolous habit of laughing out of season,\r\nand at all seasons, that the following notes are concerned.\r\n\r\nThe laureate’s is a good keynote to begin with:—\r\n\r\n    “Prythee weep, May Lilian!\r\n      Gaiety without eclipse\r\n    Wearieth me, May Lilian.”\r\n\r\nSo with Barry Cornwall and his Hermione:—\r\n\r\n    “Something thou dost want, O queen!\r\n      (As the gold doth ask alloy,)\r\n    Tears,—amidst thy laughter seen,\r\n      Pity,—mingling with the joy.”\r\n\r\nSuch a conjunction as the courtier records of Cordelia in “King\r\nLear”—sunshine and rain at once: “her smiles and tears were like a better\r\nday: those happy smiles that played on her ripe lip, seemed not to know\r\nwhat guests were in her eyes:” “in brief, sorrow would be a rarity most\r\nbeloved, if all could so become it.” Nothing, we often hear it said, is\r\nso tedious as uniformity; and under the bright sky of Italy one sometimes\r\nsighs for a cloud. “A gay writer, who,” says Horace Walpole, “should only\r\nexpress satisfaction without variety, would soon be nauseous.” Johnson’s\r\nPapilius winds up his confession, in the “Rambler,” with a whine on the\r\nmelancholy necessity of supporting that character by study, which he\r\ngained by levity; having learned too late that gaiety must be recommended\r\nby higher qualities, and that mirth can never please long but as the\r\nefflorescence of a mind loved for its luxuriance, but esteemed for its\r\nusefulness. There must be fruitage as well as blossomy “efflorescence;”\r\nas Cowper is fain to enforce, when in the closing lines of the “Task,”\r\nhe records how he once, when called to dress a sofa with the flowers of\r\nverse, played awhile with that light task, obedient to the fair:—\r\n\r\n              ... “but soon, to please her more,\r\n    Whom flowers alone I knew would little please,\r\n    Let fall the unfinished wreath, and roved for fruit.”\r\n\r\nMark Mrs. Browning’s picture of the Lady Geraldine:—\r\n\r\n    “In her utmost lightness there is truth—and often she speaks lightly—\r\n      Has a grace in being gay, which even mournful souls approve,\r\n    For the root of some grave earnest thought is understruck so rightly\r\n      As to justify the foliage and the waving flowers above.”\r\n\r\nSo with Lord Lytton’s Helen Mainwaring, the sunny gladness of whose\r\nnature must have vent like a bird’s, though he forbids us to fancy\r\nthat that gladness speaks the levity which comes from the absence of\r\nthought: “it is rather from the depth of thought that it springs, as\r\nfrom the depth of a sea comes its music.” Well and wisely Molière’s\r\nCléonte exclaims, “Veux-tu de ces enjouements épanouis, de ces joies\r\ntoujours ouvertes? et vois tu rien de plus impertinent que des femmes qui\r\nrient à tout propos?” Such a _femme_ as the same author’s Zerbinette, a\r\nself-convicted giggler in and out of season, yet whose confession may be\r\ntwisted into an example the other way, when she says, “J’ai l’humeur\r\nenjouée, et sans cesse je ris: mais, tout en riant, je suis sérieuse sur\r\nde certains chapitres.”\r\n\r\nAmong the writings of M. de St. Evremond there is an essay on the Idea\r\nof a Woman that never was, nor ever will be found. Emilia he calls this\r\nall too perfect, impossible she. And amongst the foremost of Emilia’s\r\nfine qualities he reckons the co-existence of seriousness _au fond_ with\r\nvivacity of mien. “For we find that the gayest humour doth, at length,\r\nbecome tiresome; ... the most effervescent liveliness either disgusts or\r\nwearies you.” In the case of the celebrated Duchesse de Longueville, De\r\nRetz notices the exquisite effect of the sudden bursts of gaiety which\r\nwould at times dispel her habitual but not inexpressive languor. Mdlle.\r\nde Scudéry, in her “Clélie,” was painting a well-known, perhaps too\r\nwell-known, contemporary in the person of Clarice, when, “parmi toute\r\ncette disposition qu’elle a pour la joie,” she ascribes to this charmer,\r\n_qui rit si aisément_, a facile faculty of tear-shedding: _elle sait\r\npleurer_, whenever occasion justifies weeping. As Lady Eastlake says, in\r\nher little treatise on Music, a change of key is the most powerful engine\r\nin the hands of a musician: we cannot bear the monotony of one key long,\r\neven the most joyful: “Gaiety without eclipse wearieth me, May Lilian.”\r\nWe long for “a mournful muse, soft pity to infuse.” The Hon. Miss\r\nByron takes the liberty of telling the sister of Sir Charles Grandison\r\nthat “Your brother has hinted, Charlotte, that he loves you for your\r\nvivacity, and should still more, if you consulted time and occasion.”\r\nThe affections are justly said to be more readily called into play by a\r\nmixture of mirth and melancholy; ours being a twofold life, the union of\r\nmortal with immortal, we covet happiness, yet turn back anon to the more\r\nmajestic form of sorrow. There is a form of cheerfulness which, we are\r\nassured, nobody can stand:—\r\n\r\n    “Send me hence a thousand miles\r\n    From a face that always smiles;”\r\n\r\npeople ostentatiously and pretentiously cheerful being not unfrequently\r\nfoolish people: their spirits of a brisk but thin quality—nothing about\r\nthem in good working order. “For, in truth, the most fortunate existence\r\nhas cares enough to make gravity our normal condition.” Roland Graeme, in\r\nthe “Abbot,” earnestly assures his vivacious companion, “Ay, but, fair\r\nCatherine, there are moments of deep and true feeling, which are worth\r\nten thousand years of liveliest mirth.” Melancholy Minna is a fine relief\r\nby contrast to laughter-loving Brenda; and it is suggestively told us of\r\nthe old Udaller, their sire, that he liked his graver damsel better in\r\nthe walk without doors, and his merry maiden better by the fireside; and\r\nthat if he preferred Brenda after the glass circulated in the evening, he\r\ngave the preference to Minna before noon. So with Molly and Cynthia in\r\n“Wives and Daughters:” Molly always gentle, but very grave and silent;\r\nCynthia merry, full of pretty mockeries, and hardly ever silent—only this\r\nconstant brilliancy became a little tiresome in everyday life, being not\r\nthe sunshiny rest of a placid lake, so much as the “glitter of the pieces\r\nof a broken mirror, which confuses and bewilders.” The union of what can\r\nbe harmonized of the two distinctive characters, is sure to be engaging\r\nin no ordinary degree. As in the Beryl of “George Geith.” “You imagine,”\r\nsays Beryl, on one occasion, “because it is necessary to my existence to\r\nlaugh at people’s oddities, that I never feel for their woes. You think,\r\nbecause I have a quick sense of the ludicrous, that I have no eyes for\r\ngrief. And there you do me an injustice.” Such as Beryl will be found\r\nto take exception to predominant levity in the masculine gender, after\r\nthe manner of the fair tenant of Wildfell Hall: “I do wish he would be\r\nsometimes serious,” she writes of her endeared Arthur: “I cannot get him\r\nto write or speak in real, solid earnest. I don’t mind it now, but if it\r\nbe always so, what shall I do with the serious part of myself?” Tired\r\nout with such companionship, a complainant in one of Lovell Beddoes’\r\ntragedies exclaims,—\r\n\r\n    “I’m weary of their laughter’s empty din.\r\n    Methinks, these fellows, with their ready jests,\r\n    Are like to tedious bells, that ring alike\r\n    Marriage or death.”\r\n\r\nRather than have her uniformly saccharine and smiling, Ben Jonson’s\r\nCurius avowedly would have his mistress “angry sometimes, to sweeten off\r\nthe rest of her behaviour.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSir Walter Scott, in one page of his Diary, noting the break-up of\r\na hilarious group of guests at Abbotsford, adds the avowal, “I am\r\nnot sorry, being one of those whom too much mirth always inclines to\r\nsadness.” Even the bright extremes of joy, as Thomas Hood the elder words\r\nit, bring on conclusions of disgust:—\r\n\r\n    “There is no music in the life\r\n      That sounds with idiot laughter solely;\r\n    There’s not a string attuned to mirth\r\n      But has its chord in melancholy.”\r\n\r\nLeigh Hunt tenderly tells one of his grandchildren how, when _he_ was\r\na child, and in excessive spirits, his dear mother would sometimes say\r\nto him, “Leigh, come and sit down here by me, and let us try to think a\r\nlittle.” Better that than _riant sans cesse_, even for a child. When I\r\nwas a child, says the apostle, I thought as a child. Thinking was not\r\nout of the question even then, though it might, and by comparison with\r\nthe man’s it must, be childish thinking. For children as for men, a time\r\nto laugh and a time to weep. True, there are differences of gifts and\r\ntemperaments:—\r\n\r\n    “To some men God hath given laughter; but tears to some men He hath\r\n      given:\r\n    He bade us sow in tears, hereafter to harvest holier smiles in Heaven;\r\n    And tears and smiles, they are His gift: both good, to smite or to\r\n      uplift.\r\n    He knows His sheep: the wind and showers beat not too sharply the\r\n      shorn lamb:\r\n    His wisdom is more wise than ours: He knew my nature—what I am:\r\n    He tempers smiles with tears: both good, to bear in time the\r\n      Christian mood.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_DISALLOWED DESIGNS._\r\n\r\nPROVERBS xix. 21.\r\n\r\n\r\n“There are many devices in a man’s heart; nevertheless, the counsel of\r\nthe Lord, that shall stand.” Even the counsels of the prudent He bringeth\r\nto nought. “There is no wisdom, nor understanding, nor counsel, against\r\nthe Lord,” nor any that prospers without Him. Without Him, where is the\r\nwise? where is the scribe? What, after all, is the wisdom of the children\r\nof this world, wiser in their generation than the children of light? Hath\r\nnot God made foolish the wisdom of this world? For it is written, “I will\r\ndestroy the wisdom of the wise.” Nay; unworldly wisdom, in its forming\r\nof plans, and elaboration of schemes, and devising of devices, enjoys no\r\nprivileged immunity from failure, at the veto of Him who chargeth His\r\nangels with folly. “L’homme propose, Dieu dispose.” The Divine disposal\r\nof human proposals is ofttimes very summary and entire.\r\n\r\nThe proverb, “Man proposes, God disposes,” is believed by one learned in\r\nsuch lore to be naturalised in every nation of Europe:—thus the Spanish,\r\n“La gente pone, y Dios dispone;” the German, with its corresponding\r\njingle, “Der Mensch denkt’s, Gott lenkt’s,” etc., so deeply upon all men\r\nis impressed the sense of Hamlet’s assertion of a Divinity that shapes\r\nour ends, rough-hew them how we will. Molière’s shrewd-spoken Dorine\r\nenounces a truism when reminding Damis that,—\r\n\r\n    “On n’exécute pas tout ce qui se propose;\r\n    Et le chemin est long du projet à la chose.”\r\n\r\nA wise man endeavours, it has been said, by considering all\r\ncircumstances, to make conjectures and form conclusions: but the smallest\r\naccident intervening (and in the course of affairs it is impossible to\r\nforesee all) often produces such turns and changes, that at last he is\r\njust as much in doubt of events as the most ignorant and inexperienced\r\nperson. What Shakspeare in his sonnets calls “millioned accidents” creep\r\nin between design and result, between plan and performance, between\r\nscheme and issue, and “blunt the sharpest intents.” As the old moralising\r\npoet, modernised by Dryden, puts it—\r\n\r\n    “But see how Fortune can confound the wise,\r\n    And when they least expect it, turn the dice.”\r\n\r\nFortune, or fate, is the popularly recognised agent in these reversals\r\nand collapses; and subtile philosophers speculate curiously on the\r\nplenipotent character of this agency. One such, for example, predisposed\r\nto paradox may-be, yet no heedless or hasty penman, affirms, that if you\r\nlook closely into the matter, it will be seen that whatever appears most\r\nvagrant, and utterly purposeless, turns out, in the end, to have been\r\nimpelled the most surely on a preordained and unswerving track. Chance\r\nand change, he goes on to remark, love to deal with men’s unsettled\r\nplans, not with their idle vagaries. So that, as he argues the matter, if\r\nwe desire unexpected and unimaginable events, we should contrive an iron\r\nframework, such as we fancy may compel the future to take one inevitable\r\nshape; for then comes in the unexpected, and shatters our design in\r\nfragments.\r\n\r\nThe biographer of Columbus, narrating the story of his shipwreck in 1492,\r\ndescribes him as passing, with his usual excitability, from a state of\r\ndoubt and anxiety to one of sanguine anticipation, and thus coming to\r\nconsider his present misfortune as a providential event mysteriously\r\nordained by Heaven to work out the success of his enterprise. At once,\r\ntherefore, he began to look forward to glorious fruits to be reaped\r\nfrom this seeming evil, and laid his plans accordingly. “Such was the\r\nvisionary yet generous enthusiasm of Columbus, the moment that prospects\r\nof vast wealth broke upon his mind. What in some spirits would have\r\nawakened a grasping and sordid avidity to accumulate, immediately filled\r\nhis imagination with plans of magnificent expenditure. But how vain\r\nare our attempts to interpret the inscrutable decrees of Providence!\r\nThe shipwreck, which Columbus considered the act of Divine favour, to\r\nreveal to him the secrets of the land, shackled and limited all his\r\nafter-discoveries.” For it is shown to have linked his fortunes, for the\r\nremainder of his life, to this island, which was doomed to be to him a\r\nsource of cares and troubles, to involve him in a thousand perplexities,\r\nand to becloud his declining years with humiliation and disappointment.\r\n\r\n    “Le ciel agit sans nous en ces événements,\r\n    Et ne les régle point dessus nos sentiments.”\r\n\r\nIt is instructive to note in the memoirs of Gabriel Naudé, that great\r\nscholar’s exultant anticipation of the public opening of the library he\r\nhad mainly helped to form. He must have reckoned on that day as a _beau\r\njour_ for him, the happiest day of his life; and he arranged a fête\r\naccordingly, to be celebrated with his most intimate friends. But that\r\nvery day broke out the public troubles of the Fronde; and barricades in\r\nthe streets of Paris ill accorded with Gabriel Naudé’s cherished hopes.\r\n“Ainsi vont les projets humains sous l’œil d’en haut qui les déjoue.” The\r\nScotch ploughman-poet, eyeing the mouse and its “wee bit housie, too, in\r\nruin,” as turned up by his plough, gave racy utterance to but a trite\r\nreflection, when, apostrophising the “wee sleekit, cow’rin, tim’rous\r\nbeastie,” he thus moralised his song:—\r\n\r\n    “But, mousie, thou art no thy lane,\r\n    In proving foresight may be vain:\r\n    The best-laid schemes o’ mice an’ men\r\n                    Gang aft a-gley,\r\n    And leave us nought but grief an’ pain,\r\n                    For promised joy.”\r\n\r\nAs the good friar in Shakspeare has it,—\r\n\r\n    “A greater power than we can contradict\r\n    Hath thwarted our intents,”\r\n\r\nwell laid and discreetly devised as they seemed to be.\r\n\r\nAnd as with the seemingly laudable plans of the prudent, so with the\r\narrogant designs of the self-confident. The enemy said, “I will pursue,\r\nI will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied\r\nupon them; I will draw my sword; my hand shall destroy them.” Thus said\r\nthe enemy, even Pharaoh’s host, on the shores of the Red Sea. But then\r\nsang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord: “Thou\r\ndidst blow with Thy wind, the sea covered them; they sank as lead in the\r\nmighty waters.” It is but an emphasised reading of the standard text,\r\nthat the Lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought, and maketh\r\nthe devices of the people of none effect, and casteth out the counsel\r\nof princes. Whereas, turning from man proposing to God disposing, “The\r\ncounsel of the Lord shall endure for ever, and the thoughts of His heart\r\nfrom generation to generation.” The same is He of whom it is written that\r\nHe turneth wise men backwards, and maketh their knowledge foolish.\r\n\r\nWordsworth, ever a moralist, moralised his song when, at a critical\r\njuncture in the legend of the “White Doe of Rylstone,” he interposed this\r\nreflection:—\r\n\r\n    “But quick the turns of chance and change,\r\n    And knowledge has a narrow range;\r\n    Whence idle fears, and needless pain,\r\n    And wishes blind, and efforts vain.”\r\n\r\nFor a closing variation on the present theme, a worse might be found than\r\nthis from the play within the play of “Hamlet:”—\r\n\r\n    “But, orderly to end where I begun,—\r\n    Our wills, our fates, do so contrary run,\r\n    That our devices still are overthrown;\r\n    Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.”\r\n\r\nBut, with a slight change of title and text, the same theme is pursued,\r\nin the section next ensuing, through another fugue-course of variations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_MAN DEVISING, GOD DIRECTING._\r\n\r\nPROVERBS xvi. 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n“A man’s heart deviseth his way; but the Lord directeth his steps.”\r\nMan devises, God directs; man proposes, God disposes. There is a way\r\nthat seemeth right unto a man, and practicable, plausible, easy of\r\naccomplishment, and sure of success. But the counsel of the Lord puts a\r\nveto on the scheme; and the counsel of the Lord, that shall stand.\r\n\r\nLuther charges it against princes and potentates in his day, that when\r\nthey take in hand an enterprise, they do not pray before they begin, but\r\nset to work calculating: three times three make nine, twice seven are\r\nfourteen—so-and-so will do so-and-so—in this manner will the business\r\ncome to a prosperous issue: “but our Lord God says unto them, For whom\r\nthen do ye hold me? for a cypher? Do I sit here above in vain, and to no\r\npurpose? Ye shall know, that I will twist your accounts about finely, and\r\nmake them all false reckonings.”\r\n\r\nSays old Alice, in “Mary Barton,” “I sometimes think the Lord is against\r\nplanning. Whene’er I plan over much, He is sure to send and mar all\r\nmy plans, as if He would ha’ me put the future into His hands. Afore\r\nChristmas-time I was as full as full could be of going home for good\r\nand all; yo has heard how I’ve wished it this terrible long time....\r\nMany a winter’s night did I lie awake and think that, please God,\r\ncome summer, I’d go home at last. Little did I think how God Almighty\r\nwould baulk me for not leaving my days in His hands, who had led me\r\nthrough the wilderness hitherto.” It is very like Rousseau to say, in\r\nreference to a fully determined project of his, for the fulfilment of\r\nwhich nothing was wanting but “ce qui ne dépend pas des hommes dans les\r\nprojets les mieux concertés,”—that “on dirait qu’il n’y a que les noirs\r\ncomplots des méchants qui réussissent; les projets innocents des bons\r\nn’ont presque jamais d’accomplissement.” But who can hope for anything\r\nlike contentment, as Mr. Helps somewhere asks, so long as he continues\r\nto attach that ridiculous degree of importance to the events of this\r\nlife which so many people are inclined to do? Observe, he bids us, the\r\neffect which it has upon them: they are most uncomfortable if their\r\nlittle projects do not turn out according to their fancy—nothing is to\r\nbe angular to them—they regard external things as the only realities;\r\nand as they have fixed their abode here, they must have it arranged to\r\ntheir mind. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu assures one of her correspondents\r\nthat never had she been so little mistress of her own time and actions as\r\nsince she lived alone; and going on to account for this, she observes,\r\n“Mankind is placed in a state of dependency, not only on one another\r\n(which all are in some degree), but so many inevitable accidents thwart\r\nour designs and limit our best-laid projects.” The poor efforts of our\r\nutmost prudence, and political schemes, she fancies must appear in the\r\neyes of some superior beings, like the pecking of a young linnet to break\r\na wire cage, or the climbing of a squirrel in a hoop. If to this bit of\r\nmorality from the greatest of lady letter-writers in England, a parallel\r\npassage may readily be cited from the greatest of lady letter-writers in\r\nFrance, there is a characteristic difference, in the tone of religious\r\nfeeling, conspicuous generally by its absence in Lady Mary’s case, but\r\na pervading, though underlying, force in that of Madame de Sévigné. The\r\nlatter describes on one occasion the “cruel derangement” of her family\r\nplans, so nicely arranged, and so ripe for completion; then adds, if with\r\na sigh, with a sigh of gentle resignation, “La Providence le veut ainsi.\r\nElle est tellement maitresse de toutes nos actions, que nous n’exécutons\r\nrien que sous son bon plaisir, et je tache de ne faire de projets que le\r\nmoins qu’il m’est possible, afin de n’être pas si souvent trompée; car\r\nqui compte sans elle compte deux fois.” How vain, exclaims the author of\r\n“Destiny,” are all our schemes for futurity! Human wisdom exhausts itself\r\nin devising what a higher Power shows to be vanity. We decide for to-day,\r\nand a passing moment scatters our decisions as chaff before the wind. We\r\nresolve for to-morrow, to-morrow comes but to root up our resolutions.\r\nWe scheme for our works to remain monuments of our power and wisdom, and\r\nthe most minute, the most trivial event is sufficient to overturn all\r\nour purposes, and cast down to the dust the thoughts and the labours of a\r\nlife. Truly, “it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.”\r\n\r\nWere the affairs of this world to be guided implicitly by human wisdom,\r\nsuggests one of Scott’s sententious doctors of divinity, or were they\r\nuniformly to fall out according to the conjectures of human foresight,\r\nevents would no longer be under the domination of that time and chance\r\nwhich happen unto all men; since we should, in the one case, work out\r\nour own purposes to a certainty, by our own skill; and, in the other,\r\nregulate our conduct according to the views of unerring prescience.\r\n“But man is, while in this vale of tears, like an uninstructed bowler,\r\nso to speak, who thinks to attain the jack by delivering the bowl\r\nstraightforward upon it, being ignorant that there is a concealed bias\r\nwithin the spheroid, which will make it, in all probability, swerve away,\r\nand lose the cast.” The future, in the words of a later fiction, is not\r\na blank sheet of paper, for us to write any story we please upon, but a\r\nwonderful chart, mapped out by a Divine and unerring hand.\r\n\r\n    Ούδέ τις ἀνθρώπων ἐργάζεται, ἐν φρεσὶν εἰδὼς\r\n    Ἐς τέλος, εἴτ’ ἀγαθὸν γίγνεται εἴτε κακὸν.\r\n    Πολλάκι γαρ δοκέων θήσειν κακόν, ἐσθλὸν ἔθηκε,\r\n    Καί τε δοκῶν θήσειν ἐσθλόν, ἔθηκε κακόν.\r\n    Ὀυδέ τῳ ἀνθρώπων παραγίγνεται ὅσσ’ ἐθέλησεν.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Thackeray propounds the query, Who can foresee everything, and\r\nalways? and returns his own answer (a sufficiently safe one), Not the\r\nwisest amongst us,—he does so in reference to the counsels of the worldly\r\nwoman who governed and directed the Newcome family; which counsels bore\r\nresults so different from what that elderly lady desired, and foresaw.\r\nAnd he proceeds to point his moral by the tale of a French king’s fall.\r\n“When his majesty, Louis XIV., jockied his grandson on to the throne of\r\nSpain (founding thereby the present revered dynasty of that country), did\r\nhe expect to peril his own, and bring all Europe about his royal ears?\r\nCould a late King of France, eager for the advantageous establishment\r\nof one of his darling sons, and anxious to procure a beautiful Spanish\r\nprincess, with a crown and kingdom in reversion, for the simple and\r\nobedient youth, ever suppose that the welfare of his whole august race\r\nand reign would be upset by that smart speculation?” The master of irony\r\nprofesses to take only the most noble examples to illustrate the conduct\r\nof such a noble old personage as her ladyship of Kew, who brought a\r\nprodigious deal of trouble upon some of the innocent members of her\r\nfamily, whom no doubt she thought to better in life by her experienced\r\nguidance, and undoubted worldly wisdom. We may be as deep as Jesuits, he\r\ncontinues,—may know the world ever so well, lay the best ordered plans,\r\nand the profoundest combinations,—and by a certain not unnatural turn\r\nof fate, we, and our plans and combinations, are sent flying before\r\nthe wind. “We may be as wise as Louis Philippe, that many counselled\r\nUlysses whom the respectable world admired so; and after years of patient\r\nscheming, and prodigies of skill; after coaxing, wheedling, doubling,\r\nbullying wisdom, behold, yet stronger powers interpose: and schemes and\r\nskill and violence are nought.” As Schiller’s Wallenstein puts it, in his\r\nrather heathenish way—\r\n\r\n    “For jealous are the powers of destiny.\r\n    Joy premature, and shouts ere victory,\r\n    Encroach upon their rights and privileges.\r\n    We sow the seed, and they the growth determine.”\r\n\r\n“Il y a,” in the words of a masterly French moralist, “je ne sais quelle\r\n_force cachée_, a dit Lucrèce (ce que d’autres avec Bossuet nommeront\r\nProvidence), qui semble se plaire à briser les choses humaines, à faire\r\nmanquer d’un coup l’appereil établi de la puissance, et à déjouer la\r\npièce, juste au moment ou elle promettait de mieux aller.” O fate of\r\nfools! exclaims Zara, in the “Mourning Bride,”—“officious in contriving;\r\nin executing, puzzled, lame, and lost;” a rebuke which Selim deprecates\r\nin his reply:—\r\n\r\n    “Prescience is Heaven’s alone, not given to man.\r\n    If I have failed in what, as being man,\r\n    I needs must fail, impute not as a crime\r\n    My nature’s want.”\r\n\r\nSo with the resolute undertaking of Argantes, in Tasso, to slay Tancred,\r\nthe slayer of his betrothed; all the people applauding his resolve, and\r\nrejoicing in the assurance that this—\r\n\r\n                                “... boaster stout\r\n      Would kill the prince who late had slain his love.\r\n    O promise vain! it otherwise fell out.\r\n      Men purpose, but high gods dispose above;\r\n    For underneath his sword this boaster died,\r\n    Whom there he scorned and threatened in his pride.”\r\n\r\nIn Homer, again, how grieves Achilles, and, impetuous, vents to all his\r\nmyrmidons his loud laments?\r\n\r\n    “By what vain promise, gods! did I engage,\r\n    When, to console Menætius’ feeble age,\r\n    I vowed his much-loved offspring to restore;\r\n    Charged with rich spoils to fair Opuntia’s shore.\r\n    But mighty Jove cuts short, with just disdain,\r\n    The long, long views of poor designing man!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A PURSEBEARER’S PROTEST AGAINST PURPOSELESS WASTE._\r\n\r\nST. JOHN xii. 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was very costly ointment of spikenard that Mary took and anointed\r\ntherewith the feet of Jesus, so that the house was filled with the\r\nodour of the ointment. So costly, that it set one of His apostles to\r\nwork, counting the cost. Judas Iscariot was this ready reckoner. He\r\nwas conversant with figures. He was the pursebearer of the apostolic\r\ncircle, and knew, it seems, how and when and why to keep a tight finger\r\non the purse-strings. The wasted contents—waste he accounted it—of that\r\nalabaster box might have been sold for three hundred denarii, and the\r\nproceeds given to the poor. As pursebearer he protested. And nominally\r\nhis protest was in behalf of the poor.\r\n\r\nReferring to that text in Exodus which tells how the people brought much\r\nmore than enough for the service of the work which the Lord commanded to\r\nmake, the question was put by a divine who, being dead, yet speaketh:\r\nWhen will the earth again hear that glad announcement? Yet, until we\r\nbring more than enough, he said, at least until there is kindled in\r\nus a spirit which will make us desire to do so, we shall never bring\r\nenough. “And ought we not? Your economists will say _No._ They who would\r\nthink the sun a useful creature, if he would come down from the sky and\r\nlight their fires, will gravely reprehend such wasteful extravagance.”\r\nThis last figure of speech has its parallel in Mr. Carlyle’s estimate\r\nof “the uses of this Dante:” he declines to say much about his “uses;”\r\nhe holds that an influence working, like Dante’s, into the depths of\r\nour existence, and feeding through long times the life-roots of all\r\nexcellent things whatsoever, is not to be very satisfactorily computed\r\nby “utilities.” Dante shall therefore be invaluable, or of no value: “We\r\nwill not estimate the sun by the quantity of gas-light it saves us.”\r\n\r\nJudas the pursebearer was, as a French divine characterizes him,\r\n_exact_, _positif_, _calculateur_; one who habituated himself to compute\r\neverything by a ready-money standard, and to appraise every action by\r\nthe rule of immediate utility. He might be accurate to a fraction in\r\nhis reckoning of what that “wasted” ointment would have fetched in the\r\nmarket; but, had not his heart been already in some sort ossified, he\r\nwould have comprehended that “au dessus de l’utile il y a le beau, et\r\nau dessus du calcul le dévouement, et qu’ à une âme qui déborde d’une\r\njoie extraordinaire il faut des moyens extraordinaires aussi pour\r\nexprimer ce qu’elle éprouve. Judas a perdu le sens des réalités purement\r\nspirituelles, qui lui paraissent vagues, parce que, comme l’infini, elles\r\nrésistent aux chiffres.”\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Justus Jonas told Dr. Martin Luther of a certain potent\r\nlandholder, who said to Duke John Frederic, when commending to him the\r\ngospel of Christ, “Sir, the gospel pays no interest,”—“Have you no\r\ngrains?” was Luther’s interrogative comment,—citing the words of the\r\nswine at the lion’s feast, when invited to feast on recondite dainties.\r\nEven so, said Dr. Martin, there are inveterate worldlings who, when\r\ninvited to the spiritual feast of fat things well refined, “turn up their\r\nsnouts, and ask for guilders. Offer a cow nutmeg, and she will reject it\r\nfor old hay.”\r\n\r\nIt is a too true bill of indictment against the mass of men, that,\r\nknowing that two and two make four, and that four is of a higher value\r\nthan three, they practically conclude, carrying out into practice the\r\nconclusion, that to amass is to become wealthy, and that to bestow is\r\nto become the poorer. With this arithmetic the children of this world\r\nare wise in their generation, and add field to field, house to house,\r\nto some purpose. But by what right, asks a voice from the sanctuary, do\r\nthey take upon themselves to pronounce on such qualities and realities\r\nas devotion and charity, as detachment from the “good things of this\r\nlife” and renunciation of indulgence to the senses? If they witness a\r\ndeed of noble self-sacrifice, they can but wag their heads, in shocked\r\nsurprise and bewilderment at such a blunder in arithmetic, _une telle\r\nfaute de calcul_. “Ils ne comprennent pas qu’on puisse soupirer après\r\nd’autres biens que ceux de la matière, après d’autres vérités que celles\r\nde l’arithmétique.” There are many, very many more things than are dreamt\r\nof in their philosophy; dreaming, indeed, is rather out of their way; and\r\nperhaps philosophy too, for the matter of that.\r\n\r\nColeridge, denouncing the “moral” consequences of Napoleon’s tyranny, as\r\nfar more to be dreaded than the worst of those outward and calculable\r\nevils, which chiefly shock the imaginations of men, is out of all\r\npatience with such objections as, “What _good_ will the Tyrolese do\r\nthemselves by their heroic resistance?” “What are the Spaniards fighting\r\nfor?” etc.,—as if man were made only to eat above ground, and be\r\neaten; as if we had no dignity to preserve, no conscience to obey, no\r\nimmortality to expect.\r\n\r\nWhat good can it do him? demands the vulgar fine lady in “Cecil,” who\r\nhears that a certain well-to-do man of genius has written a book. A man,\r\nshe argues, writes for money or distinction: what can be this man’s\r\nobject? he don’t want to be made a baronet, nor does he want to increase\r\nhis income. Where can be the _use_ of writing? And where, she is (by\r\ncross-questioning) answered, can be the use to the aloe of its flower,\r\nto the mine of its gold? Oldbuck of Monkbarns might have done worse than\r\nparody, as he did, the “brutal ignorance” of your _cui bono_ querists of\r\nthe baser sort, in the strain of Gray’s Bard,—\r\n\r\n    “Weave the warp and weave the woof,\r\n      The winding-sheet of wit and sense;\r\n    Dull garment of defensive proof\r\n      ’Gainst all that does not gather pence.”\r\n\r\nThat a new machine, a new experiment, the discovery of a salt, or of a\r\nbone, should, in England, receive a wider homage, than the most profound\r\nspeculation from which no obvious results are apprehended,—this way\r\nof contemplating affairs Mr. Buckle was prompt to own as certainly\r\nproductive of great good. But he also took care to declare it to be,\r\nwith equal certainty, a one-sided way, satisfying a part only of the\r\nhuman mind—many of the noblest intellects craving for something which it\r\ncannot supply. There are mortals who, as a clerical essayist has said,\r\ncannot understand or sympathise with the gratification arising from a\r\nstudy of graceful and beautiful objects; who think that the supply of\r\nanimal necessities is all that any man (but themselves, perhaps) can\r\nneed. What more can he want? they exclaim, if the man be well-fed, and\r\nwell-dressed, and well-lodged. Why, if he had been a horse or a pig, is\r\nthe answer, he would have wanted nothing more; but the possession of a\r\nrational soul brings with it pressing wants which are not of a material\r\nnature, not to be supplied by material things, and not felt by pigs and\r\nhorses. And the craving for surrounding objects of grace and beauty is\r\nheld to be one of these. Mr. Emerson, in his far-going way, goes so far\r\nas to say, as regards the “base rate at which the highest mental and\r\nmoral gifts are held” in his country,—that let a man attain the highest\r\nand broadest culture that any American has possessed, then let him die\r\nby sea-storm, railroad collision, or other accident, “and all America\r\nwill acquiesce that the best thing has happened to him; that, after the\r\neducation has gone far, such is the expensiveness of America, that the\r\nbest use to put a fine person to, is, to drown him to save his board.”\r\nM. de Tocqueville somewhere observes, that to cross almost impenetrable\r\nforests, to swim deep rivers, to encounter pestilential marshes, to\r\nsleep exposed to the damp air of the woods,—these are efforts which an\r\nAmerican easily conceives, if a dollar is to be gained by them—that is\r\nthe point; but that a man should take such journeys from curiosity, he\r\ncannot understand. The German poet is often cited for his remark, that\r\nthe Cow of Isis is to some the divine symbol of knowledge, to others but\r\nthe milch cow, only regarded for the pounds of butter she will yield. An\r\nEnglish sympathiser exclaims, “O tendency of our age, to look on Isis as\r\nthe milch cow! Gaze on the goddess,” he bids a sordid aspirant, “and get\r\nready the churn and thy scales, and let us see what butter will fetch\r\nin the market.” When Judge Haliburton’s typical Yankee is asked by the\r\nold minister what he thinks of Niagara, and forthwith expatiates on the\r\n“grand spec” it offers for factory purposes—for carding mills, fulling\r\nmills, cotton mills, grain mills, saw mills, plaster mills, and never a\r\nwant of water for any or all of them, his pastor upbraids him with almost\r\nsacrilege in that style of talk; exclaiming, “How that dreadful thirst\r\nof gain has absorbed all other feelings in our people, when such an idea\r\ncould be entertained for a moment! It [Niagara] is a grand spectacle, it\r\nis the voice of nature in the wilderness, proclaiming to the untutored\r\ntribes there of the power and majesty and glory of God.... Talk not\r\nto me of mills, factories, and machinery, sir, nor of introducing the\r\nmoney-changers into the temple of the Lord.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_LIGHT AT EVENING-TIME._\r\n\r\nZECHARIAH xiv. 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe promise, or prediction, to be found in the words of the son of\r\nBerechiah, that “at evening-time it shall be light,” is gratefully\r\naccepted by devout souls in perhaps a strained and wrested sense; but\r\na sense so comforting, so full of tenderness and beauty, that one is\r\nfain to believe the words may favour, if they cannot be said to warrant,\r\nthis “accommodation of Scripture.” Divines are fain to give technical\r\ndivinity the go-by for the nonce, while, as they confess, the deepening\r\ntwilight seldom fails to suggest to them this cheering promise, a promise\r\nwhich “tells how the Christian’s day shall end, how the day of life may\r\nbe somewhat overcast and dreary, but light shall come on the darkened\r\nway at last.” In the same spirit are welcome the words of Amos, the\r\nherdsman of Tekoa, concerning One who turneth the shadow of death into\r\nthe morning. To Him the darkness and the light are both alike; and at His\r\nbidding, when despondent sufferers are in a horror of great darkness, and\r\nsay surely the darkness shall cover them,—even the night shall be light\r\nabout them; and in some sort to them, even as to Him, the night shineth\r\nas the day; or at least, in the language of Zechariah, there is light,\r\nwhich if not clear, is yet not dark; neither wholly day nor night, but\r\ntwilight—soft, soothing, tranquillizing—instead of the dreaded darkness\r\nwhich may be felt. Even thus He brings the blind by a way that they knew\r\nnot, making darkness light before them.\r\n\r\nEven thus, at the last, He delivers them who through fear of death were\r\nall their lifetime subject to bondage. Bunyan exemplifies such in Mr.\r\nFearing, the pilgrim, who at the entrance of the Valley of the Shadow\r\nof Death was “ready to die for fear.” But the valley was quiet from\r\ntroublers. “I suppose those enemies here had now a special check from our\r\nLord, and a command not to meddle until Mr. Fearing had passed over it.”\r\n“And here also I took notice of what was very remarkable—the water of\r\nthat river was lower at this time than ever I saw it in all my life; so\r\nhe went over at last, not much above wetshod.\r\n\r\n“_Honesty_: Then it seems he was well at last?”\r\n\r\n“_Greatheart_: Yes, yes; I never had a doubt about it.”\r\n\r\nOften, observes Schleiermacher in one of his letters, the last radiant\r\nmoment is called rapidly into being, even in souls wherein the eternal\r\nLight has not always shone with bright effulgence.\r\n\r\nBiographers of Dr. Johnson tell us how, when at length the moment,\r\ndreaded through so many years, came close, the dark cloud passed away\r\nfrom his mind; how his temper became unusually patient and gentle, and\r\nhe ceased to think with terror of death, and of that which lieth beyond\r\ndeath, and spoke much of the mercy of God and of the propitiation of\r\nChrist. One might apply to him in effect the lines of the poet of the\r\nSeasons.\r\n\r\n    “Joy seized his withered veins, and one bright gleam\r\n    Of setting life shone on her evening hours.”\r\n\r\nMeditating on various senses in which the words of the promise of light\r\nat evening-time speak truly, in which its great principle holds good, the\r\nsignal blessing shall come when it is needed most and expected least,\r\nDr. Boyd, thinks mainly how sometimes, at the close of the chequered and\r\nsober day, the Better Sun has broken through the clouds and made the\r\nflaming west all purple and gold. He pictures the chamber of death, while\r\nhushed and mournful gazers see also the summer sun in glory going down.\r\n“But it is only to us who remain that the evening darkness is growing,\r\nonly for us that the sun is going down.” As the evening falls on us, but\r\nnot on the departing believer; as the shadows deepen on us, but not on\r\nhim; as the darkness gathers on us, but not on him; the “glorious promise\r\nhas found its perfect fulfilment, that ‘at the evening-time there shall\r\nbe light.’”\r\n\r\nSecular literature has its analogous instances. Dr. Holmes describes\r\nElsie Venner’s storm-tossed, vagrant spirit as composed and serene at\r\nthe last; the cold glitter died out of the diamond eyes, and the stormy\r\nscowl disappeared from the dark brows. “It seemed to her father as if\r\nthe malign influence—evil spirit it might almost be called—which had\r\npervaded her being had at last been driven forth or exorcised,” and that\r\nthe tears she now shed were “at once the sign and the pledge of her\r\nredeemed nature. But now she was to be soothed and not excited. After her\r\ntears she slept again, and the look her face wore was peaceful as never\r\nbefore.” And the devoted father, to whom her life-long career had been\r\nuntil now a perturbing trial, now thanked God for the brief interval of\r\npeace which had been granted her, and for the sweet communion they had\r\nenjoyed in these last days. There are those of whom it may be said that\r\nit comes to pass, when midday is over, and they cast wistful glances, and\r\nperhaps even reproachful petitions heavenwards, until evening-time, that\r\nthere is from above neither voice, nor any to answer, nor seemingly any\r\nthat regardeth; but with evening-time comes an answer and comes light.\r\nApplicable to the subject, in this sense, are the lines in “Paracelsus,”\r\non one who lived without God in the world:—\r\n\r\n    “Then died, grown old; and just an hour before—\r\n    Having lain long with blank and soulless eyes—\r\n    He sate up suddenly, and with natural voice\r\n    Said, that in spite of thick air and closed doors\r\n    God told him it was June.”\r\n\r\nOf Margaret Arundel, in “The Gordian Knot,” we read, in her hour of\r\nhousehold desolation and distress, that could we have seen her fair face,\r\nnow pale with pain, now flushed with emotion, we should have pitied her;\r\nbut “it may be that some superior intelligence witnessed her suffering,\r\nand pitied her not; knowing that all she was to undergo was but the\r\nfiery trial destined for those for whom in the evening there is light.”\r\nStephen Blackpool, in “Hard Times,” who has found life “aw a muddle,”\r\nand meets with his death in the pit, is tranquillized with light at the\r\nlast—light which he identifies with the star that shone upon him while he\r\nlay mangled in the old shaft. “Often as I coom to myseln, and found it\r\nshinin’ on me down there in my trouble, I thowt it were the very star as\r\nguided to our Saviour’s home. I awmost think it be the very star.” His\r\nrescuers lift him up, and he is overjoyed to find they are about to take\r\nhim in the direction whither the star seems to him to lead. Very gently\r\nthey carry him along the fields and down the lanes; but it is soon a\r\nfuneral procession. “The star had shown him where to find the God of the\r\npoor; and through humility and sorrow and forgiveness, he had gone to\r\nhis Saviour’s rest.” It is not every life the early prime of which has\r\nbeen blissful enough to warrant the exclamation,—\r\n\r\n    “Ne’er tell me of glories serenely adorning\r\n      The close of our day, the calm eve of our night:\r\n    Give me back, give me back, the wild freshness of morning,\r\n      Its smiles and its tears are worth evening’s best light.”\r\n\r\nFor sometimes the light comes at evening-time that has never come before.\r\n\r\nCellini opens his autobiography with a placid record of the enjoyment\r\nof his present lot, in life’s decline, in contrast with the storms and\r\nturmoil of his previous course. We read of James Watt, that not until he\r\nhad reached what is termed the grand climacteric of man’s life did he\r\nknow real freedom from bodily infirmities; and that his spirits became\r\nmore equable as the principal causes of his anxiety and occasional\r\ndepression were removed; so that although he was destined to be one of\r\nthose “who are so strong that they come to fourscore years,” his strength\r\neven then, while it could scarcely be termed “labour,” was certainly\r\nvery far from “sorrow.” The cloud which had so long hung over him was\r\ngently lifted up, and the curtain parted, to disclose a happier scene.\r\n“It is curious that even physical ease and enjoyment should come so\r\nlate; but so it was. The term which commenced with his release from the\r\nevils of active business was a serene and golden time, in which he found\r\nrepose”—with the softening retrospect of a struggle past and a victory\r\nwon. John Galt, in “The Entail,” exemplifies a kindred experience in the\r\nwidow Walkinshaw, whose deliverance from an all but lifelong thraldom,\r\nlate in the day as it came, yet came in time enough to “allow the\r\noriginal brightness of her mind to shine out in the evening with a serene\r\nand pleasing lustre.”\r\n\r\nDr. Boyd quotes the dying speech of a poor English day labourer, than\r\nwhich, he affirms, few sentences ever touched him more with their\r\nhopeless pathos: “Wut wi’ faeth, and wut wi’ the earth goin’ round the\r\nsun, and wut wi’ the railways all a-whuzzing and a-buzzing, I’m clean\r\nmuddled, confoozled, and bet!” It is Stephen Blackpool again in spirit,\r\nand to the letter. With that sentence the dying man is said to have\r\nfeebly turned to the wall, and spoken no more. “Well, let us hope that\r\nlight came at the evening-time upon that blind, benighted way.”\r\n\r\nAmong the dying words of Mrs. Schimmelpenninck, honourably known by\r\nher “Memoirs of Port Royal,” and other works, the remark is preserved\r\nthat she had often in her life been inclined to occupy herself with the\r\nprospect close at hand, from finding the bleak, hard outline of the\r\neternal hills cold and barren to her sight; but that, as she drew nearer,\r\nGod’s mercy made His light to shine full upon them, so that she could now\r\nperceive they were covered with magnificent trees of the forest, and were\r\nrich in fruit and flowers far more pleasant than those close at hand, and\r\nyet a continuation of them.\r\n\r\nA commentator on the text of “promised light at evening-time,” explains\r\nthat by evening is understood the gradual withdrawal of the light; it is\r\nthe lessening light that makes the evening-time: because of _that_ the\r\ndaisies close, and the birds fly to their nests, and a hush comes over\r\nnature. And it is just because evening is the time when, in the ordinary\r\ncourse of things, the light is going and the darkness is coming, that\r\nthere is found to be anything remarkable in the text of _um den Abend\r\nwird es licht seyn_, as Luther’s version runs. The promise, or prophecy,\r\nis that “light shall come at a time when it is not natural, when in the\r\ncommon course of things it is not looked for.” It would be no surprise,\r\nas this divine proceeds to remark, that light should come at noonday: we\r\nexpect it then, it is just what we are accustomed to see. “But if, when\r\nthe twilight shadows were falling deeper and deeper, ... with a sudden\r\nburst the noonday light were to spread around,—that would be a surprise.”\r\nOne of his personal illustrations of its import is the instance of\r\nthe Christian poet who passed away almost in despair,—the gloom that\r\novershadowed his spirit enduring almost to the end: “but even in the\r\nlast moment there came a wonderful change”—and they tell us how even on\r\nhis dead face there remained, till it was hidden for ever, a look of\r\nbright and beautiful and sudden surprise; the reflection of that light at\r\nevening that had been long in coming, but had come at last. At eventide\r\nlight may break forth as the morning; light rising in obscurity, and\r\ndarkness becoming as the noonday.\r\n\r\nLight in darkness—light springing up out of darkness—the blessedness of\r\nthis is emphatically recognised both by signal example and in special\r\npromise, in Holy Writ. When the hand of Moses was stretched out toward\r\nheaven, and darkness fell over the land of Egypt, even darkness which\r\nmight be felt—a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt for three\r\ndays—the Egyptians saw not one another, neither rose any from his place\r\nfor three days. But all the children of Israel had light in their\r\ndwellings. “When I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a light unto\r\nme.” “For thou wilt light my candle; the Lord my God will enlighten my\r\ndarkness.” In the same Psalm that tells how clouds and darkness are round\r\nabout Him, the Father of lights, is contained the exulting assurance,\r\nthat “light is sown for the righteous.” The light of the righteous\r\nrejoiceth, when the lamp of the wicked hath been put out. Well may\r\nspiritual aspirations be fervent for light to be sent forth, to lead and\r\nto guide to His holy hill and tabernacle, lest the feet of the wayfarer\r\nslip in a way that he knows not; and, above all, when they stumble on the\r\ndark mountains, or lose their footing in the swelling of Jordan.\r\n\r\n_Lux è tenebris_—who will not prize it? who does not need it? For—\r\n\r\n                “What am I?\r\n    An infant crying in the night,\r\n    An infant _crying for the light_,\r\n    And with no language but a cry.”\r\n\r\nAn exceeding bitter cry this crying for the light sometimes is, in such\r\nas those, for instance, whom Robertson of Brighton describes as “turning\r\nfrom side to side,” feeling with horror the old, and all they hold dear,\r\ncrumbling away—the ancient light going out—more than half suspecting\r\nthe falsehood of the rest, and with an earnestness amounting to agony,\r\nleaving their home, like the Magians, and inquiring for fresh light.\r\n\r\nTurning from side to side, with the wailing note of interrogation, “Who\r\nwill show us any good?” And then, more earnestly than ever, “Lord, lift\r\nThou up the LIGHT of Thy countenance upon us.” In vain we turn from side\r\nto side. To whom should we go but unto Thee? Turn us again, O Lord God of\r\nhosts; show the LIGHT of Thy countenance, and we shall be saved.\r\n\r\nObservable for special application is what Locke makes observable as a\r\ngeneral fact, that new-born children always turn their eyes to that part\r\nwhence the light comes, lay them how you please.\r\n\r\nWhen the blind are operated on for the restoration of sight, it is\r\nsuggestively remarked by an eminent author, that the same succouring\r\nhand which has opened to them the visible world, immediately shuts out\r\nthe bright prospect again for a time, a bandage being passed over the\r\neyes, lest in the first tenderness of their recovered sense, they should\r\nbe fatally affected by the sudden transition from darkness to light.\r\nBut, as he goes on to say, between the awful blank of total privation of\r\nvision, and the temporary blank of vision merely veiled, there lies the\r\nwidest difference. “In the moment of their restoration the blind have\r\nbut one glimpse of light, flashing on them in an overpowering gleam of\r\nbrightness, which the thickest, closest veiling cannot extinguish. The\r\nnew darkness is not like the void darkness of old: it is filled with\r\nrapid, changing visions of brilliant colours and ever-varying forms,\r\nrising, falling, whirling hither and thither with every second.” And thus\r\nis it made evident that even when the handkerchief is passed over them,\r\nthe once sightless eyes, though bandaged fast, are yet not blinded as\r\nthey were before. All the more, however, they now dread the blankness\r\nof that total eclipse, now that, as it were, to them that walked in the\r\nshadow of death, light is sprung up. Light, how much the more precious\r\nfor that background of blackness of darkness, darkness that still may be\r\nfelt!\r\n\r\nLight that may be felt, is the theme of blind old Œdipus, in Sophocles,\r\nat the hour of his mysterious departure—the hour and the power of\r\ndarkness. Farewell he bids to—\r\n\r\n                “Light, sweet Light!\r\n    Rayless to me—mine once, and even now\r\n    I feel thee palpable, round this worn form\r\n    Clinging in last embrace.”\r\n\r\nImmortal as Homer is the prayer of his Ajax to die, if die he must, in\r\nthe light. Contrast with this the _modus moriendi_ of Pompey the Great,\r\nas pictured in Corneille:—\r\n\r\n    “D’un des pans de sa robe it couvre son visage,\r\n    A son mauvais dentin en aveugle obéit,\r\n    Et dédaigne de voir le ciel qui le trahit.”\r\n\r\nSo with the Greek wife in Landor’s Hellenics, who resists the bidding to\r\nfall not on her knees, but to look up:—\r\n\r\n                                  “The hand\r\n    That is to slay me, best may slay me thus.\r\n    I dare no longer see the light of heaven.”[35]\r\n\r\nBut to die in the light is the almost universal craving. “As a matter of\r\nfact, nothing,” it has been remarked, “is more common than the craving\r\nand demand for light a little before death;” a remark confirmed by the\r\nsad experience of many who have tended and watched the last moments of\r\na friend. “What more frequent than a prayer to open the shutters, and\r\nlet in the sun? What complaint more repeated, and more touching than\r\nthat ‘it is growing dark’?” We are told of a sufferer who did not seem\r\nin immediate danger, suddenly ordering the sick room to be lit up as for\r\na gala. When this was mentioned to the physician, he said, gravely, “No\r\nworse sign.” We all remember the tenor of the last words of Dr. Adam, of\r\nthe High School, Edinburgh, as recorded (however variously) by Scott and\r\nLord Cockburn and others. It was in his bed-chamber, and in the forenoon,\r\nthat he died; and finding that he could not see, the old schoolmaster,\r\nbelieving himself in the familiar school-room, exclaimed, “It is getting\r\ndark, boys; we must put off the rest till to-morrow.” It was the darkness\r\nof death. And to the living, to-morrow, above all, _that_ to-morrow,\r\nnever comes.\r\n\r\nM. de Lescure, dying of the wounds he had received at the battle\r\nof Chollet, awaited with his usual serenity the advent of his last\r\nhour. “Open the windows,” said he to his wife, who was watching by\r\nhis bedside, “is it clear?” “Yes,” she said, “the sun is shining.” “I\r\nhave, then,” replied the dying general, “a veil before my eyes.” A\r\nveil that no man could raise. Chateaubriand, in describing the last\r\nhours of his sister, Madame de Beaumont—the Lucile of his “Memoires\r\nd’outre-tombe”—incidentally relates that “she begged of me to open the\r\nwindow.... A ray of sunshine rested upon her bed, and seemed to rejoice\r\nher spirit.” The same circumstance is related of the dying Emperor\r\nAlexander. So it is of Dr. Channing. Karl Ludwig Sand, on the scaffold,\r\nbegged that the bandage over his eyes might be so placed that he could,\r\nuntil his last moment, see the light. And it was so. Turner’s biographer\r\ntells us that almost at the very hour of the old painter’s death, his\r\nlandlady wheeled his chair to the window, that he might see the sunshine\r\nhe had loved so much, mantling the river, and glowing on the sails of the\r\npassing boats. “The old painter died with the winter-morning sun shining\r\nupon his face, as he was lying in his bed. The attendant drew up the\r\nwindow-blind, and the morning sun shone on the dying artist—the sun he\r\nhad so often beheld with such love and such veneration,” and painted, at\r\nsundry times and in divers manners, with such force.\r\n\r\nRousseau’s wish, when in a dying state, to be carried into the open\r\nair, that he might have “a parting look at the glorious orb of day,” is\r\nreferred to by one of the many biographers of Robert Burns, in recording\r\nthat poet’s remark one beautiful evening, when the sun was shining\r\nbrightly through the casement. The hand of death was then upon him, and a\r\nyoung friend rose to let down the window-blinds, fearing the light might\r\nbe too much for him. Burns thanked her, with a look of great benignity,\r\nbut prayed her to let the sun shine on: “he will not shine long for me.”\r\n\r\nTender and true is the pathos in one of Mrs. Richard Trench’s letters,\r\ntouching the death of her endeared child, Bessy, where we read: “The\r\nlast phrase she uttered, except those expressive of her latest wants and\r\npain, was a desire the window-curtain might be withdrawn, that she might\r\nlook at the stars.” Sunlight or starlight, it is light we cherish, and\r\nthat cherishes us. Light from the first, light to the last. Happy, if the\r\nlight we cherish is the shining light, that shineth more and more unto\r\nthe perfect day.\r\n\r\nAnother set of variations on the same theme will form the section next\r\nensuing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_WISHED-FOR DAY._\r\n\r\nACTS xxvii. 29.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in a ship of Alexandria, sailing into Italy, when sailing was now\r\ndangerous, because of the advanced season; it was during a voyage which\r\nPaul, a passenger, foresaw and foretold would be with hurt and much\r\ndamage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of lives two hundred\r\nthreescore and sixteen; it was after there had arisen against the ship\r\na tempestuous wind called Euroclydon, before which the vessel became a\r\nhelpless drift; then it was that the crew and passengers, exceedingly\r\ntossed with the tempest, and not comforted—except the apostle, gave up,\r\nwith the same exception, all hope of escape, and gloomily awaited the\r\nbitter end. On the third day they cast out the tackling of the ship. And\r\nwhen neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest\r\nlay on them, all hope that they should be saved was then taken away. The\r\nfourteenth night was come, and they were driven up and down in Adria, and\r\nabout midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country,\r\nand sounded once and again, and found reason to fear lest they should\r\nhave fallen upon rocks. So they cast four anchors out of the stern, and\r\n_wished for the day_—ηὔχοντο ἡμέραν γενέσθαι. If ’tis double death to\r\ndie in sight of shore, as Shakspeare says, it is also, or nearly, double\r\ndeath to die in the dark. Some would almost say, Surely the bitterness of\r\ndeath is past, if light be vouchsafed to the dying, and so the shadows\r\nflee away. Well can they understand a pregnant symbolism in that incident\r\nof patriarchal days, when a deep sleep fell upon Abram as the sun was\r\ngoing down; and, lo, a horror of a great darkness fell upon him. With\r\nsomething of a shuddering sympathy can they connect the fact that, on the\r\nday whence all Good Fridays take their name, there was darkness over all\r\nthe land unto the ninth hour, with that other fact that about the ninth\r\nhour there was heard a wailing cry, whose echo reverberates through all\r\nspace and time, _Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?_\r\n\r\nEver memorable in classical lore is the supplication of the Greek warrior\r\nin Homer, not to die in the dark. Let him see his foe, and see his end,\r\nhowever imminent, however inevitable. King Edward II., in Christopher\r\nMarlowe’s historical tragedy, left alone in the Berkeley Castle dungeon\r\nwith Lightborn, a murderer, exclaims:—\r\n\r\n    “I see my tragedy written in thy brows;\r\n    Yet stay awhile, forbear thy bloody hand,\r\n    And let me see the stroke before it comes,\r\n    That even then, when I shall lose my life,\r\n    My mind may be more steadfast on my God.”\r\n\r\nFrequent in historical narrative are instances like that of Labedoyère,\r\nwho when brought out to be shot, refused to have his eyes bandaged, and\r\nlooking straight at the levelled muskets, exclaimed in a loud voice,\r\n“Fire, my friends!” Marshal Ney, a week or two later, also refused to\r\nhave his eyes bandaged. “For five-and-twenty years,” he said, “I have\r\nbeen accustomed to face the balls of the enemy.” Then taking off his hat\r\nwith his left hand, and placing his right upon his heart, he too said in\r\na loud voice, fronting the soldiers, “My comrades, fire on me.” Murat\r\nfell in a like manner, after a like request,—but gazing to the last on a\r\nmedallion which contained portraits of his wife and four children.\r\n\r\nWhat mainly tends to pile up the agony of Goisvintha, in the historical\r\nromance of “Antonina,” when alone in the vaults with the madman Ulpius,\r\nis the distracting absence of light. “Bewildered and daunted by the\r\ndarkness and mystery around her, she vainly strained her eyes to look\r\nthrough the obscurity, as Ulpius drew her on into the recess.... Suddenly\r\nhe heard her pause, as if panic-stricken in the darkness, and her voice\r\nascended to him, groaning, ‘Light, light! oh, where is the light?’” She\r\nis held forth at this crisis, as a terrible evidence of the debasing\r\npower of crime, as she now stands, enfeebled by the weight of her own\r\navenging guilt, and “by the agency of darkness, whose perils the innocent\r\nand the weak have been known to brave.” It is only your melodramatic\r\nvillain that flings forth his flourish in the style of Velasquez in\r\n“Braganza,”—addressing the duke, his judge:—\r\n\r\n    “Yes, in your gloomiest dungeons plunge me down.\r\n    Welcome, congenial darkness! horrors, hail!\r\n    No more these loathing eyes shall see that sun\r\n    Whose irksome beams light up thy pageant triumph.”\r\n\r\nAnd thus Sir Walter Scott has full warranty for proving the exceptional\r\ncourage of his captive Englishman, when subjected to a midnight trial\r\nin the vaults of the _Vehmgericht_, by showing him unappalled by even\r\nthe utter darkness of that terrible court. “Even in these agitating\r\ncircumstances, the mind of the undaunted Englishman remained unshaken,\r\nand his eyelid did not quiver nor his heart beat quicker, though he\r\nseemed, according to the expression of Scripture, to be a pilgrim in the\r\nvalley of the shadow of death, beset by numerous snares, and encompassed\r\nby total darkness, where light was most necessary for safety.” It is only\r\nin an oblique sense that what Euripides says is true, of the coward\r\nbeing very valiant in the dark—ἐν ὄρφνῃ δραπέτης μέγα σθένει.\r\n\r\nDr. Croly applies the Homeric prayer of Ajax to an incident in the long\r\nwar with France, when twenty-seven thousand British were eager, under\r\nAbercrombie and the Duke of York, to attack the French lines, and at the\r\nfirst tap of the drum a general cheer was given from all the columns.\r\nBut the day, we read, had scarcely broke when a dense fog fell suddenly\r\nupon the whole horizon, and rendered movement almost impossible. “Nothing\r\ncould exceed the vexation of the army at this impediment, and if our\r\nsoldiers had ever heard of Homer there would have been many a repetition\r\nof his warrior’s prayer, that ‘live or die, it might be in the light of\r\nday.’” One is reminded of the lines in Racine:—\r\n\r\n    “Enfin toute l’horreur d’un combat ténébreux;\r\n    Que pouvait la valeur dans ce trouble funeste?”\r\n\r\nIt has been observed of a certain railway catastrophe, where the crash\r\nand collision occurred in a tunnel—in that very place which nobody, even\r\non ordinary occasions, passes through without a slight shudder and an\r\nundefined dread of some such disaster as the one in question—that “Ajax’s\r\nprayer has been muttered by many who never heard of Ajax; and if we are\r\nto die, it is at least a mitigation of the hour of fate when it overtakes\r\nus in daylight.”\r\n\r\nIn tracing, psychologically, the development within us of the sense\r\nof awe, Professor Newman attributes to the gloom of night (_deadly\r\nnight_, as Homer terms it), more universally perhaps than to any other\r\nphenomenon, the first awakening of an uneasy sense of vastness. A young\r\nchild, as he says, accustomed to survey the narrow limits of a lighted\r\nroom, wakes in the night, and is frightened at the dim vacancy. “No\r\nnurse’s tales about spectres are needed to make the darkness awful.”\r\nNor, he adds, is it from fear of any human or material enemy: it is the\r\nnegation, the unknown, the unlimited, which excites and alarms; and\r\nsometimes the more if mingled with glimpses of light.\r\n\r\nThe last words audible of Goethe were, “_More light!_” The final darkness\r\ngrew apace, in the words of his ablest biographer; and he whose eternal\r\nlongings had been for more light, gave a parting cry for it as he was\r\npassing under the shadow of death.\r\n\r\n“Light! give me more light,” is the cry of the dying woman in “The Dead\r\nSecret,”—whereby hangs that tale. How often Lord Lytton remarks, is\r\n“light!” the last word of those round whom the shades are gathering. And\r\nhe says it in reference to the last hours of one of the characters he\r\nhas described with most success as well as elaboration, John Burley, who\r\ndiscourses of what is precious in light, as the darkness closes about\r\nhim. When he lies down, and the attendant would withdraw the light, he\r\nmoves uneasily. “Not that,” he murmurs, “light to the last!” And putting\r\nforth a wan hand, he draws aside the curtain, so that the light may\r\nfall full on his face. When his only friend returns, and steals back to\r\nBurley’s room on tiptoe, it is to see light stream through the cottage\r\nlattice—not the miserable ray lit by a human hand—but the still and holy\r\neffulgence of a moonlit heaven. Burley has died in sleep—calmly, and\r\nthe half open eyes have the look of inexpressible softness which death\r\nsometimes leaves; “and still they were turned towards the light; and the\r\nlight burned clear.” Which things are an allegory.\r\n\r\nMr. Dickens intensifies the wretchedness of his prisoner at Marseilles\r\nby the deprivation of light in a prison that, like a well, like a vault,\r\nlike a tomb, had no knowledge of the brightness outside, and would have\r\nkept its polluted atmosphere intact, in one of the spice islands of the\r\nIndian Ocean. What light he does get comes languishing down a square\r\nfunnel that blinds a window in the staircase wall, through which the sky\r\nis never seen—nor anything else. What he does see of the “light of day”\r\nhe calls the light of yesterday week, the light of six months ago, the\r\nlight of six years ago: so slack and dead. Bitter indeed is the import of\r\nthe curse, “Let it look for light and have none.” Piteous indeed is the\r\nimport of the pathetic remonstrance, “Wherefore is light given to him in\r\nmisery?” Graphic indeed is the description of a place “where the light is\r\nas darkness.” Darkness and light are both alike to One only.\r\n\r\nThe record of the last day in the life of Patrick Fraser Tytler opens as\r\nfollows:—“On Sunday, the 23rd, he grew confused in memory, experienced\r\ndifficulty in swallowing, and complained of darkness. The curtain was\r\ndrawn, and the light of the winter morning was suffered to stream on his\r\nbed; but in vain. He folded his hands, and exclaimed, ‘I see how it is.’”\r\n\r\nJohn Foxe relates this incident in his narrative of the martyrdom of\r\nWilliam Hunter, apprentice to a silk weaver in London, but discharged\r\nfrom his master’s employment for refusing to attend mass, and finally\r\ncondemned to the stake as an incorrigible heretic. “Then said William,\r\n‘Son of God, shine upon me!’ and immediately the sun in the element shone\r\nout of a dark cloud so full in his face that he was constrained to look\r\nanother way, whereat the people mused, because it was dark a little time\r\nbefore.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE MORE THAN BROTHERHOOD OF A BOSOM FRIEND._\r\n\r\nPROVERBS xviii. 24.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last book of the Pentateuch we meet with a verse which,\r\nincidentally, seems to recognise how much more vitally close and intimate\r\nmay be the affinity between a man and his bosom friend, than between\r\nthe same man and his own brother. The brother is spoken of without\r\ndescriptive epithet or adjunct of any kind; while of the friend it is\r\nadded, “which is as thine own soul.”[36] An ever memorable verse in the\r\nbook of Proverbs has immortalized the truth, that “there is a friend that\r\nsticketh closer than a brother.”\r\n\r\nNone too many are the testimonies on record of brotherly attachment such\r\nas Columbus signalizes in his correspondence. To his elder son, Diego,\r\nthe affectionate father writes concerning the younger, Fernando, then a\r\nstripling midway in his teens, “To thy brother conduct thyself as the\r\nelder brother should unto the younger. Thou hast no other, and I praise\r\nGod that this is such a one as thou dost need. Ten brothers would not be\r\ntoo many for thee. Never have I found a better friend to right or left\r\nthan my brothers.” General testimony points the other way. Cicero, who,\r\nhimself a good brother, in one place moots the question whether it is\r\njust to prefer our friends to our relations—_quæritur sitne æquum amicos\r\ncognatis anteferre_,—in another decides that friendship is better than\r\nrelationship: _præstat amicitia propinquitati_. It has been remarked\r\nby Samuel Bailey, of Sheffield, that parents and children, husbands\r\nand wives, brothers and sisters, reciprocally complain of each other’s\r\ndeficiency of affection, and think it hard that the tie of relationship\r\nshould not secure invariable kindness and indestructible love: expecting\r\nsome secret influence of blood, some physical sympathy, some natural\r\nattraction, to retain the affection of their relatives, without any\r\nsolicitude on their part to cherish or confirm it; and forgetting that\r\nman is so constituted as to love only what in some way or other, directly\r\nor indirectly, immediately or remotely, gives him pleasure,—that even\r\nnatural affection is the result of pleasurable associations in his mind,\r\nor at least may be overcome by associations of an opposite character,\r\nand that the sure way to make themselves beloved is to display amiable\r\nqualities to those whose regard they wish to obtain.[37] Crabbe has a\r\nterse couplet on—\r\n\r\n                                  ... “those\r\n    Who are called friends because they are not foes;”\r\n\r\nmeaning by friends, kinsfolk; but such as, though not more than kin, are\r\nless than kind. Dr. Croly’s hero, Marston, soldier and statesman, on\r\nreceiving, in his isolation, three letters from three proved friends,\r\nyet comparative strangers, describes himself as feeling, “while holding\r\ntheir letters in my hand, and almost pressing them to my heart, how much\r\nmore strongly friendship may bind us than the ties of cold and negligent\r\nrelationship.” So Mr. Thackeray is bitter on what it is to have sham\r\nfriends and no sympathy; ties of kindred which bind one, as it were, to\r\nthe corpse of friendship, and oblige one to bear through life the weight\r\nand the embraces of this lifeless, cold connection.\r\n\r\nNoteworthy among the avowals of Sir Thomas Browne, in his “Religio\r\nMedici,” is this: “I confess I do not observe that order that the schools\r\nordain our affections,—to love our parents, wives, children, and then\r\nour friends; for, excepting the injunctions of religion, I do not find\r\nin myself such a necessary and indissoluble sympathy to all those of my\r\nblood. I hope I do not break the fifth commandment, if I conceive I may\r\nlove my friend before the nearest of my blood, even those to whom I owe\r\nthe principles of life.” The father and the son may, as Montaigne says,\r\nbe of quite contrary humours, and brothers be without any sympathy with\r\nbrothers. So Feltham asserts it to be likeness which makes the true\r\nlove-knot of friendship. When we find another of our own disposition,\r\nwhat is it, he asks, but the same soul in a divided body? “We are then\r\nintermutually transposed into each other; and nature, which makes us\r\nlove ourselves, makes us for the same reason love those who are like us;\r\nhence a friend is a more sacred name than a brother.” What avails it, he\r\nfurther asks, to have bodies of the same original, when the souls within\r\nthem differ?\r\n\r\nThe autobiographer in a modern work of fiction, having occasion to\r\nacknowledge, after being thrust amongst strangers to sicken, and all\r\nbut die, that among strangers he received as much sympathy and kindness\r\nas he should have done among his own people, and in his father’s\r\nhouse,—characterizes this sort of confession as one which people are apt\r\nto make as a reflection upon their relations, “whereas it disgraces only\r\nthemselves.” It is a case of rare misfortune, he contends, when we are\r\nnot loved by our nearest of kin, in proportion as we desire and deserve\r\nto excite affection. Nevertheless, there is a too ample _consensus_ of\r\nauthorities whose testimony affirms, and confirms, the often slight and\r\nslender tenure of mere family ties, as such. “None of your family parties\r\nfor me,” quoth one of Justice Haliburton’s shrewd spokesmen; “connections\r\nat best are poor friends, and commonly bitter enemies. If you want\r\nnothing, go to them, and you are sure to get it; if you are in want of\r\nany assistance, go to a stranger friend you have _made for yourself_, and\r\nthat’s the boy that has a heart and a hand for you.” The Earl of Dudley,\r\nBishop Copleston’s correspondent, in one of his always interesting\r\nletters to that prelate, adverting to the death of an uncle who had never\r\ntaken the smallest interest in him, or showed him the smallest kindness,\r\nmakes the avowal: “And, though I flatter myself that there is no person\r\nmore capable of returning affection than myself, yet I fairly own that\r\nI am wholly unable to bestow it quite gratuitously even upon a near\r\nrelation.” Richardson harps on this note again and again in his history\r\nof Clarissa. How much more binding and tender, that young lady writes—and\r\nthe writing comes of bitter experience—are the ties of pure friendship\r\nand the union of like minds, than the ties of nature! And her chief\r\ncorrespondent, in commenting on the terms of a kinsman’s assurance, that\r\nhe will not see Clarissa “imposed on either by friend or foe,”—interposes\r\nthe verbal amendment: “By _relation_ or foe, should he not have said? For\r\na friend will not impose upon a friend.” Elsewhere the same writer has\r\nto put the home-question: “Would you side with a false brother against a\r\ntrue friend? A brother may not be a friend; but a friend will be always a\r\nbrother.”\r\n\r\nIt was one of the aphorisms—or call them paradoxes—of M. de Stendhal\r\n(Henri Beyle) that our next of kin are our natural enemies when we enter\r\nthe world; the simple matter of fact being, as an Edinburgh reviewer\r\nalleges, that his own character, tendencies, and aspirations had been\r\ninvariably opposed to the plans, wishes, and modes of thinking of his\r\nfamily. Mr. Froude has depicted in Edward Fowler a young man who in his\r\ndealings with every one except with his own family, was frank, generous,\r\nand unselfish; and whose affections, naturally very strong, finding\r\nthemselves forced out of their proper channel, poured themselves out on\r\nany one that happened to attract him. A few kind words from his father,\r\nnow and then, implying real sympathy and inviting confidence, might,\r\nwe are given to understand, have averted in this case, as in so many\r\nothers, a bitter result of estrangement and desolation. Perhaps, as Mr.\r\nDisraeli somewhere intimates, with all their anxiety and opportunities\r\nfor observation, the parent and tutor are rarely skilful in discovering\r\nthe character of their child or charge. “Custom blunts the fineness\r\nof psychological study: those with whom we have lived long and early,\r\nare apt to blend our essential and our accidental qualities in one\r\nbewildering association.” Strange, exclaims Hamilton Aïde, how little we\r\noften know of those who are next us in the battle-ranks through this long\r\nmarch of life! Our daily familiar life, as George Eliot has remarked,\r\nis but a hiding of ourselves from each other behind a screen of trivial\r\nwords and deeds; and those who sit with us at the same hearth are often\r\nthe farthest off from the deep human soul within us, full of unspoken\r\nevil and unacted good. “Strangers yet,” as Lord Houghton has it:—\r\n\r\n    “After childhood’s winning ways,\r\n    After care, and blame, and praise,\r\n    Counsel asked, and wisdom given,\r\n    After mutual prayers to heaven,\r\n    Child and parent scarce regret\r\n    When they part—are strangers yet.”\r\n\r\nOr as Chauncy Hare Townshend expresses the same relative truth, too\r\nabsolutely true:—\r\n\r\n    “Kindred are oft but kin by name,\r\n    Our thoughts they never knew.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_MANY YEARS TO ENJOY LIFE: THIS NIGHT TO DIE._\r\n\r\nST. LUKE xii. 19, 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rich man was getting richer to his heart’s content. So plentiful was\r\nthe produce of his land, that he must needs enlarge his premises. There\r\nwas not room enough in his barns for those golden harvests; the barns\r\nmust be pulled down, and greater ones built, wherein to bestow all his\r\nfruits and his goods. Happy man he accounted himself that day; happy in\r\na prosperous present, happier still in a promising future. A future of\r\nhappiness not less prolonged than assured. So he would say to his soul\r\nthat day, “Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine\r\nease, eat, drink, and be merry.” That day he said it. Fool! that night\r\nhis soul was required of him.\r\n\r\nWoe was denounced by one of old on another of the Dives family, who said,\r\n“I will build me a wide house, and large chambers,” and who cut him out\r\nwindows, and ceiled his house with cedar, and painted it with vermilion.\r\n“Shalt thou reign because thou closest thyself in cedar?” Man’s sanguine\r\nand sure “I will”—how little of the future tense there sometimes is about\r\nit after all!\r\n\r\n    “Tu secanda marmora\r\n      Locas sub ipsum funus; et sepulchri\r\n    Immemor, struis domos.”\r\n\r\nIn Homer we see from his tall ship the king of men descend, there fondly\r\nthinking the gods conclude his toil, where, in fact, awaits him murder\r\nmost foul and most unnatural. In Homeric figure—\r\n\r\n    “So, whilst he feeds luxurious in the stall,\r\n    The sovereign of the herd is doomed to fall.”\r\n\r\nBitterly the shade of Atrides repeats his tragic story to Odysseus,\r\ntelling how, “Alas! he hoped, the toils of war o’ercome, to meet soft\r\nquiet and repose at home. Delusive hope!” for at home the hand was\r\nalready upraised to smite him.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish prince, Alp Arslan, dying of Joseph’s dagger-stroke,\r\nbequeathed an admonition to the pride of kings, which Gibbon has\r\npreserved. “Yesterday, as from an eminence I beheld the numbers, the\r\ndiscipline, and the spirit of my armies; the earth seemed to tremble\r\nunder my feet; and I said in my heart, ‘Surely thou art the king of the\r\nworld, the greatest and most invincible of warriors.’ These armies are no\r\nlonger mine; and in the confidence of my personal strength, I now fall by\r\nthe hand of an assassin.” The inscription on his tomb invited those who\r\nhad seen the glory of Alp Arslan exalted to the heavens, to meditate on\r\nits present burial in the dust.\r\n\r\nMichelet moralises with trenchant irony on the fate which overtook our\r\nHenry V. on French soil. It is to the “Dance of Death” he refers in the\r\nexclamation, “What sport for death, what a malicious pastime to have\r\nbrought the victorious Harry within a month’s reach of the crown of\r\nFrance! After a life of unremitting toil for that end, he wanted but one\r\nlittle month added to his existence to be the survivor of Charles VI....\r\nNo! not a month, not a day more was to be his.”\r\n\r\nSplendid was that festival at Cæsarea at which Herod Agrippa, in the\r\npomp and pride of power, entered the theatre in a robe of silver, which\r\nglittered, says the historian, with the morning rays of the sun, so as to\r\ndazzle the eyes of the assembly, and excite general admiration. Some of\r\nhis flatterers set up the shout, “A present god!” Agrippa did not repress\r\nthe impious adulation which spread through the theatre. At that moment he\r\nlooked up, and saw an owl perched over his head on a rope, and Agrippa\r\nhad been forewarned that when next he saw that bird, “at the height of\r\nhis fortune,” he would die within five days. The fatal omen, according\r\nto Josephus, pierced the heart of the king, who, with deep melancholy,\r\nexclaimed, “Your god will soon suffer the common lot of mortality.” He\r\nwas immediately struck, in the language of the sacred volume, by an\r\nangel. Seized with violent pains, he was carried to his palace, lingered\r\nfive days in extreme agony, being “eaten of worms,” and so died.\r\n\r\nFielding forcibly presents a certain sanguine projector, lusty and\r\nstrong, in the heyday of middle age, who reckons confidently on becoming\r\nheir to the estate of a senior of immense wealth, and has all his plans\r\nelaborately prepared for his disposal of the same. Nothing is wanting to\r\nenable him to enter upon the immediate execution of these plans, but the\r\ndeath of the elder man, in calculating which he has studied every book\r\nextant that treats of the value of lives, reversions, etc.; from all\r\nwhich he has satisfied himself, that as he has every day a chance of this\r\nhappening, so has he more an even chance of its happening before long.\r\n“But while the captain was one day busied in deep contemplations of this\r\nkind, one of the most unlucky, as well as most unseasonable, accidents\r\nhappened to him. The utmost malice of fortune could, indeed, have\r\ncontrived nothing so cruel, so _mal-à-propos_, so absolutely destructive\r\nto all his schemes.” It was, that just at the very instant when his heart\r\nwas exulting in meditations on the happiness which would accrue to him\r\nby the other’s death, he himself was cut off by an apoplexy. As Léontine\r\ncomplains in “Heraclius,”—\r\n\r\n    “Et lorsque le hasard me flatte avec excès,\r\n    Tout mon dessein avorte au milieu du succès.”\r\n\r\nIt was just when Kleber was beginning to reap the fruits of his\r\nintrepidity and discretion, that he was cut off by the obscure assassin,\r\nSouliman. One is reminded of Thomson on the massacre of the bees,—\r\n\r\n                      “At evening snatched,\r\n    Beneath the cloud of guilt-concealing night,\r\n    And fixed o’er sulphur; while not dreaming ill,\r\n    The happy people in their waxen cells,\r\n    Sat tending public cares, and planning schemes\r\n    Of temperance, for winter poor,” etc.\r\n\r\nA tory historian, recording the close of the parliamentary session in\r\nJuly 1827, takes occasion to observe that Mr. Canning now saw every wish\r\nof his heart gratified, having raised himself to the highest position\r\nin the State, and being looked up to in every part of the world as the\r\nprotector of the oppressed and the advocate of freedom. In the prime of\r\nlife, “his sway in Parliament was unbounded, and he might hope for a\r\nlong career of fame, fortune, and usefulness.” _Vanitas vanitatum!_ The\r\nhand of fate was already upon him, and he was to be suddenly snatched\r\nfrom the scene of his glory, at the very moment when he seemed to have\r\nattained the summit of earthly felicity. Even, however, when death is not\r\nconcerned, as in his memorable case, in the sudden and final collapse of\r\na great career, and the abrupt extinction of exuberant promise, how often\r\nis Cowper’s picture realized, where—\r\n\r\n          “Runs the mountainous and craggy ridge\r\n    That tempts ambition. On the summit, see,\r\n    The seals of office glitter in his eyes;\r\n    He climbs, he pants, he grasps them. At his heels,\r\n    Close at his heels, a demagogue ascends,\r\n    And with a dexterous jerk soon twists him down,\r\n    And wins them, but to lose them in his turn.”\r\n\r\nThe picture is, in some sort, and for moral uses, a pendent to that by\r\nanother poet, of those who are pushing hard up hill the cumbrous load of\r\nlife; just as they trust to gain the farthest steep, and put an end to\r\nstrife,—\r\n\r\n    “Down thunders back the stone with mighty sweep,\r\n    And hurls their labours to the valley deep,\r\n    For ever vain.”\r\n\r\nBut this is diverging farther and farther from the direct import of our\r\ntheme. More to the purpose is the same poet’s description of Celadon\r\nassuring his betrothed of perfect safety, and triumphantly asserting\r\nher absolute immunity from the perils of the storm, and as exultingly\r\ninferring his own, from his relationship to her; when,—\r\n\r\n                    “From his void embrace,\r\n    Mysterious heaven! that moment to the ground,\r\n    A blackened corse, was struck the beauteous maid.”\r\n\r\nSome innocents, as Cleopatra has it, escape not the thunderbolt.\r\nInnocence, as well as iniquity, may know something of that breach ready\r\nto fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at\r\nan instant.\r\n\r\nThe loving friends of Charlotte Brontè, after her marriage, are described\r\nby one among them as catching occasional glimpses of brightness, and\r\npleasant peaceful murmurs of sound, telling to them who stood outside,\r\nof the gladness within; and they said among themselves, “After a long\r\nand a hard struggle—after many cares and bitter sorrows—she is tasting\r\nhappiness now.” Remembering her trials, they were glad in the idea that\r\nGod had seen fit to wipe away the tears from her eyes. “But God’s ways\r\nare not as our ways,” Mrs. Gaskell adds. Just as Currer Bell’s happiness\r\nseemed beginning, and her goodness ripening, came fever, delirium, death.\r\nMrs. Gaskell’s own career was similarly cut short, just when she was\r\nfinishing, but ere yet she had finished, the completest and ablest of her\r\nworks; just when public recognition of her merits was growing earnest as\r\nwell as general. It is the old, old story. For what, as the old ballad\r\nsays,—\r\n\r\n            “is this worldys bliss,\r\n    That changeth as the moon!\r\n    My summer’s day in lusty May\r\n    Is darked before the noon.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_GREAT BABYLON BUILT: A BUILDER’S BOAST._\r\n\r\nDANIEL iv. 29-33.\r\n\r\n\r\nWalking in the palace of his kingdom of Babylon—that Babylon of which the\r\nfoundations, indeed, had been laid ages ago, but which he had so enlarged\r\nand adorned as to make it one of the world’s wonders—Nebuchadnezzar the\r\nking, elate with pride at the pomp of architectural results, flushed with\r\nthe triumph of enterprises so costly, and achievements so manifest to the\r\neye, gave utterance, in complacent soliloquy perhaps, to the exultant\r\nsense of being a master builder indeed, and of seeing his power reflected\r\nin so gorgeous a form. The king spake and said, “Is not this great\r\nBabylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom, by the might of\r\nmy power, and for the honour of my majesty?”\r\n\r\nWhile the word was in the king’s mouth, there fell a voice from heaven,\r\nsaying, “O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken: The kingdom is\r\ndeparted from thee.” And the sequel we know. How that same hour was the\r\nthing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar, and he was driven from men, and did\r\neat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till\r\nhis hairs were grown like eagles’ feathers, and his nails like birds’\r\nclaws,—is it not written in the book of the prophecies of Daniel, whose\r\nname was Belteshazzar, and whom the king made ruler over the whole\r\nprovince of that same Babylon the Great?\r\n\r\nThe royal builder’s boast was on the instant reproved by a degradation\r\nliterally brutal in its extremity. While the word of complacent\r\nself-glorification was in the king’s mouth, the sentence of bestial doom\r\nwent forth against him. Just when he was resting on his laurels, a taint\r\novertook them. Just when he rejoiced in asserting himself a king of\r\nkings, commenced the working of a curse which levelled him with grazing\r\nflocks and herds.\r\n\r\nThe lesson is for all time, and for all sorts and conditions of men.\r\nVerifications of it—varying, of course, in kind, and still more in\r\ndegree—are rife in records historical and biographical, and in the\r\nunrecorded experiences, the moving accidents, of everyday life. Just when\r\na man is apt to set up his rest, the fiat goes forth against him which\r\nshatters to its base the structure he has reared. The house he has just\r\nfinished building tumbles to pieces like a house of cards. The castle in\r\nwhose defences, at last completed, he felt so secure, dislimns like a\r\ncastle in the air.\r\n\r\n                        “... The engineer\r\n    Who lays the last stone of his sea-built tower,\r\n    It cost him years and years of toil to raise,—\r\n    And, smiling at it, tells the wind and waves\r\n    To roar and whistle now—but, in a night,\r\n    Beholds the tempest sporting in its place—\r\n    May look aghast.”\r\n\r\nBelshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and\r\ndrank wine before the thousand, and displayed the golden vessels which\r\nhis father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple at Jerusalem,\r\nand was jubilant with the excitement of revelry, and joyously confident\r\nin the stability of his realm; when, in the same hour, there came forth\r\nfingers of a man’s hand, and wrote over against the plaster of the wall\r\nof the king’s palace; and what they wrote was, that God had numbered his\r\nkingdom, and finished it. And in that night was Belshazzar the king of\r\nthe Chaldeans slain.\r\n\r\nA noble chamber had Pope John XXI. built for himself in the palace of\r\nViterbo; and by the falling in of the roof he so admired, he was crushed\r\nto death. “John XXI.,” writes Dean Milman, “was contemplating with too\r\ngreat pride the work of his own hands, and burst out into laughter; at\r\nthat instant the avenging roof came down on his head.” The catastrophe\r\nwas held at the time to be a special judgment on a reprobate pontiff.\r\nNebuchadnezzar’s boast, and worse than Nebuchadnezzar’s doom. The mention\r\nof Babylon the Great will serve, with some, to eke out a parallel.\r\n\r\nThe historian of Mexico tells us of Montezuma, while exacting from his\r\npeople the homage of an adulation worthy of an oriental despot, and the\r\nprofuse expenditure of whose court was a standing marvel, that “while the\r\nempire seemed towering in its most palmy and prosperous state, the canker\r\nhad eaten deepest into its heart.” Ruin was at hand. The hour was come,\r\nand the man; and that man was Hernando Cortès.\r\n\r\nSignificantly opens a fifth act—for a fifth act is the last—of Ben\r\nJonson’s “Sejanus,” with the joyous exultations of that prosperous\r\nupstart, in the confidence of power: “Swell, swell, my joys,” he\r\nexclaims,—\r\n\r\n    “I did not live till now; this my first hour;\r\n    Wherein I see my thoughts reached by my power.\r\n    ...\r\n    My roof receives me not; ’tis air I tread;\r\n    And, at each step, I feel my advanced head\r\n    Knock out a star in heaven!”\r\n\r\nand so forth, with other hyperboles of frantic arrogance. His soliloquy\r\nis interrupted by messengers of ill news. Destruction dogs his path; and\r\nvery soon the magniloquent braggart has to subdue his tone, and his cue\r\nis then to upbraid the higher powers whom alone he recognises:—\r\n\r\n    “If you will, Destinies, that after all,\r\n    I faint now ere I touch my period,\r\n    You are but cruel.”\r\n\r\nOf constant recurrence among the commonplaces of biography are such\r\n“buts,” inopportune and inevitable, as Cicero’s biographer prefixes\r\nto a critical paragraph: “But while all things were proceeding very\r\nprosperously in his favour, and nothing seemed wanting to crown his\r\nsuccess, ... all his hopes and fortunes were blasted at once, by an\r\nunhappy rencounter with his old enemy Clodius.”\r\n\r\nThere is a popular historical fiction in which we see the Cardinal\r\nAlberoni musing on the greatness he has achieved for Spain and for\r\nhimself, only to find himself overtaken by ruin and disgrace. The rope\r\nwhich he has twisted so carefully, proves to be of sand. In another we\r\nsee a successful adventurer at the culminating point of his success.\r\nThere seems nothing wanting to him in “that supreme moment,” as the\r\nphrase goes. He is in “a tumult of gratified ambition and selfish joy.”\r\n“This glory and grandeur” repay a thousand-fold his patient endeavours\r\nand strenuous schemings. But at this very moment a dark shadow overlays\r\nthe sunshine on his pathway; and we look on a changed countenance—“no\r\nlonger full of triumph and pleasure, but ghastly pale” at a sudden but\r\nvery present and very pressing sense of impending disaster. _Fortuna\r\nvitrea est, tum cum splendet frangitur._\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the twelfth century all was prosperity with the Emperor\r\nHenry IV.; his turbulent and agitated life seemed, in the words of Dean\r\nMilman, “as if it would close in an august and peaceful end.” But, as an\r\nafter page in the history of Latin Christianity is prompt to prove, this\r\nmost secure and splendid period in the life of Henry was one calm and\r\nbrilliant hour of evening before a night of utter gloom.\r\n\r\nColumbus had just welcomed tranquillity in exchange for the troubles and\r\ndangers of his island, when intelligence arrived of the discovery of a\r\nlarge tract of country rich in mines. He now anticipated the prosperous\r\nprosecution of his favourite enterprise, and was exultant at the turn\r\nof the tide. “How illusive were his hopes!” exclaims his biographer.\r\n“At this moment events were maturing which were to overwhelm him with\r\ndistress, strip him of his honour, and render him comparatively a wreck\r\nfor the remainder of his days.” Who, the chronicler of the conquest of\r\nGranada may well ask, who can tell when to rejoice in this fluctuating\r\nworld? “Every wave of prosperity has its reacting surge, and we are often\r\noverwhelmed by the very billow on which we thought to be wafted into the\r\nhaven of our hopes.” _Et subito casu, quæ valuere, ruunt._\r\n\r\nOlivarez was requested by his royal master to resign, just at the moment\r\nwhen the death of Richelieu (1643) opened to him an almost royal road, it\r\nmight seem, to success.\r\n\r\n    “O momentary grace of mortal men,\r\n    Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!\r\n    Who builds his hope in air of your fair looks,\r\n    Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,\r\n    Ready, with every nod, to tumble down\r\n    Into the fatal bowels of the deep.”\r\n\r\nSuch is the state of man, as Shakspeare’s Hastings feels it. And this\r\nis the state of man, as Shakspeare’s Wolsey finds it: to-day he puts\r\nforth the tender leaves of hope, to-morrow blossoms, and next day comes\r\na frost, a killing frost, and,—when he thinks, good easy man, full\r\nsurely his goodness is a ripening,—nips his root, and then he falls.\r\nShakspeare’s Belarius again, will furnish us with another text, of\r\npractical application:—\r\n\r\n                        “... Then was I as a tree,\r\n    Whose boughs did bend with fruit: but in one night,\r\n    A storm, or robbery, call it what you will,\r\n    Shook down my yellow hangings, nay, my leaves,\r\n    And left me bare to weather.”\r\n\r\nAnd as with the pride and pomp and circumstance of life, so with life\r\nitself. Typical for all time is the fate of Lycidas:—\r\n\r\n    “Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise\r\n    (That last infirmity of noble mind)\r\n    To scorn delights, and live laborious days;\r\n    But the fair guerdon when we hope to find,\r\n    And think to burst out into sudden blaze,\r\n    Comes the blind fury with the abhorrèd shears,\r\n    And slits the thin-spun life.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_INVOCATION AND INACTION._\r\n\r\nEXODUS xiv. 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the Red Sea close before them, and with Pharaoh and his host close\r\nbehind them, what were the children of Israel to do? Was it for this\r\nthat Moses had brought them out of the house of bondage, which yet had\r\nits fleshpots and creature comforts after all? What were they to do?\r\nThey lifted up their eyes, and saw the sea in front, and the enemy in\r\nthe rear; and then they lifted up their voice in querulous fear and\r\nexpostulation. Should they go back? Then Moses lifted up his voice, and\r\nbade them stand still, and they should see a great deliverance. But the\r\nwill of God was not that they should either go back, or stand still and\r\nmerely look on. For “the Lord said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto\r\nme? speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward.” Invocation\r\nmay be excellent in itself, but, as a concomitant, inaction mars it. A\r\nhallowed thing is prayer; but to pray and sit still, when the need is to\r\ngo forward and push on, is the sign or stigma of feeble folk.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Nelson told the King of Naples, in plain terms, that he had his\r\nchoice—either to advance, trusting to God for His blessing on a just\r\ncause, and prepared to die sword in hand; or to remain quiet, and be\r\nkicked out of his kingdom; the king made answer that he would go on, and\r\ntrust in God and Nelson. Of the same stuff as Nelson, but his superiors\r\nin moral character and in practical recognition of Him that is Holy,\r\nHoly, Holy, as well as Lord God Almighty, were those early English\r\nnavigators, characterized by a modern pen as “indomitable God-fearing\r\nmen, whose life was one great liturgy.” “The ice was strong, but God\r\nwas stronger,” says one of Frobisher’s men, after grinding a night and\r\na day among the icebergs; not waiting for God to come down and split\r\nthem, but toiling through the long hours, himself and the rest fending\r\noff the vessel with poles and planks, with death glaring at them out of\r\nthe rocks, and so saving themselves and it. We read in Turell’s Life of\r\nDr. Benjamin Colman, “that reverend father in our New England Israel,”\r\nas Mr. Lowell calls him, that when the vessel in which he had taken\r\npassage for England was attacked by a French privateer, he “fought like\r\na philosopher and a Christian, ... and prayed all the while he charged\r\nand fired.” His the practice was, if not on his lips the maxim, to pray\r\nto God and keep his powder dry. It is expressly noted of the Maid of\r\nOrleans, in the _Procès_ on record, that while she rather evaded the\r\nquestion of resorting to miraculous aids and appliances, and of affecting\r\nsupernatural power, she “used the Gallic proverb, _Ayde-toi, Dieu te\r\naydera_.”\r\n\r\n    “In daily toil, in deadly fight,\r\n    God’s chosen found their time to pray;\r\n    And still He loves the brave and strong,\r\n    Who scorn to starve, and strive with wrong,\r\n    To mend it, if they may.”\r\n\r\nForcible is the portrait drawn in a recent work of fiction, of a man now\r\nsteeped in moral degradation, who had once tried to be honest, and prayed\r\nto God to prosper his honesty; but then he only tried to do right in a\r\nspasmodic, fitful kind of way, and expected his prayers to be granted\r\nas soon as uttered, and was indignant with a Providence that seemed\r\nregardless of his entreaties.\r\n\r\nBentley is held to have happily ridiculed the helpless Chorus of Greek\r\ntragedy, who, when a deed of violence was to be acted, instead of\r\ninterfering to prevent the atrocity to which the perpetrator had made\r\nthem privy, could only, by the rules of the theatre, exhaust their sorrow\r\nand surprise in dithyrambics. He burlesqued this characteristic by\r\nintroducing into “The Wishes” a Chorus after the manner of the ancient\r\nGreeks, who are informed by one of the _dramatis personæ_, that a madman\r\nwith a firebrand has just entered the vaults beneath the place which they\r\noccupy, and which contain a magazine of gunpowder. The Chorus, instead\r\nof stirring from the dangerous vicinity, immediately commence a long\r\ncomplaint of the hardship of their fate, exclaiming pathetically, “O\r\nunhappy madman—or rather unhappy we, the victims of this madman’s fury—or\r\nthrice, thrice unhappy the friends of the madman, who did not secure him,\r\nand restrain him from the perpetration of such deeds of frenzy—or three\r\nand four times hapless the keeper of the magazine, who forgot the keys in\r\nthe door,” etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThe cry of Charles and his Paladins at Arles, “Help us, oh blessed martyr\r\nSt. Trophimus!” is thus disposed of by Torfrid, Hereward’s forefather,\r\nin the story of the Wake, “What use in crying to St. Trophimus? A tough\r\narm is worth a score of martyrs here,” in the thick of the fight for dear\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Rea, in 1630, as recorded in a well-known passage from\r\nRushworth, uttered the pious conventionalism or devout platitude, “Well,\r\nGod mend all!” his companion, Sir David Ramsay, impatiently exclaimed,\r\n“Nay,” with an undevout expletive, “Nay, Donald, we must help him to mend\r\nit!” One is reminded of what Mr. Froude says of the Protestant leaders\r\nin Scotland, during the autumn of 1559, when the Queen Regent returned\r\nto Holyrood, once more absolutely victorious: “Notwithstanding all their\r\ntalk about God, it had come to this. God had as much interest in them\r\nas they had themselves courage, energy, capacity, understanding, and\r\nperseverance—so much precisely, and not more.” Or again of that homely\r\nthrust in the “Biglow Papers,” where one of the interlocutors, on a\r\ncritical occasion, avowing a wish to know where and when to strike, is\r\nthus answered by his plain-spoken mate:—\r\n\r\n    “‘Strike soon,’ sez he, ‘or you’ll be deadly ailin’,—\r\n    Folks thet’s afear’d to fail are sure o’ failin’;\r\n    God hates your sneakin’ creturs thet believe\r\n    He’ll settle things they run away an’ leave.’”\r\n\r\nThere is something to be said—indeed in our present sense there is more\r\nto be said, for the farmer than for the clergyman in the story of the\r\nlatter congratulating the former on the state of his crops, and finding\r\nhim not free from apprehensions, in regard of former bad years—“My\r\nfriend,” urged the rector, “trust in Providence.” “Providence! Yes, yes,”\r\nreplied the other; “that’s all very well: but give me the doong cart.”\r\nDr. John Brown relates with zest how one of his faculty was attending\r\na poor woman in labour—a desperate case, that required a cool head and\r\na firm will, while the good man, “for he _was_ good,” had neither of\r\nthese,—and losing his presence of mind, gave up the poor woman as lost,\r\nand retired into the next room to pray for her. “Another doctor, who\r\nperhaps wanted what the first one had, and certainly had what he wanted,\r\nbrains and courage, meanwhile arrived, and called out, ‘Where is Dr. ⸺?’\r\n‘Oh, he has gone into the next room to pray.’ ‘Pray! Tell him to come\r\nhere this instant, and help me; he can work and pray too;’” and by the\r\nnew-comer’s, the _snell_ working doctor’s, assistance the woman’s life\r\nwas saved.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Peel, in his reply to certain suggestions offered by\r\nLord Kenyon in reference to the potato-disease, coupled with the\r\nrecommendation of a “special public acknowledgment of our dependence on\r\nGod’s mercy in our present distressed state,” was mildly sarcastic on the\r\nseeming inconsistency of making such an acknowledgment, while at the same\r\ntime leaving “in full operation the restraints which man has imposed on\r\nthe import of provisions.”\r\n\r\nNot likely to be soon forgotten, on either side the Tweed, is Lord\r\nPalmerston’s reply as Home Secretary, to the Presbytery of Edinburgh,\r\ntouching the national attitude pending a visitation of Asiatic cholera.\r\nHe advised them that it was better to cleanse than to fast. Let them\r\nsee to purifying the foul wynds and overcrowded flats tenanted by the\r\npoor, and so get rid of “those causes and sources of contagion which, if\r\nallowed to remain, will infallibly breed pestilence, and be fruitful in\r\ndeath, in spite of all the prayers and fastings of a united, but inactive\r\nnation.” To apply what a north country bishop says in Shakspeare:—\r\n\r\n    “The means that Heaven yields must be embraced,\r\n    And not neglected; else, if Heaven would,\r\n    And we will not, Heaven’s offer we refuse;\r\n    The proffered means of succour and redress.”\r\n\r\nA recent apologist for the captain of a lost steamship submitted that the\r\ndestruction of that fine vessel was what is called in the old-fashioned\r\nlanguage of a charter-party, “the act of God.” Less partial critics, on\r\nthe other hand, affirmed it to be the act of the folly and madness of\r\nman,—the term quoted belonging to an age when they who go down to the sea\r\nin ships had not learned the irreverent practice of imputing to the Deity\r\nthe direct consequences of human rashness. “Let us, if we can, amend\r\nthis folly; or, if we will persist in it, let us at least take the blame\r\nupon ourselves.” They that go down to the sea in ships have, however,\r\nin all ages, though not so much one people as another (English for\r\ninstance as Italians), been prone to waste in wailing outcries to patron\r\nsaints the energy that, in peril of wreck, they might have expended to\r\nbetter purpose. The “Colloquies” of Erasmus give a lively sample of this\r\nrun-to-waste invocation. The last of the heroes of La Vendée, Charette,\r\nwhile still a youth, sailed from Brest in a cutter which lost its mast,\r\nand was in imminent jeopardy of going down; the sailors, on their knees,\r\nwere praying to the Virgin, and had entirely given up all notion of\r\nexertion, “till Charette, by killing one, succeeded in bringing the\r\nothers to a sense of their duty, and thereby saved the vessel.” Lord\r\nBroughton describes a scene of the kind, in a Turkish ship of war: the\r\nGreeks on board called on all the saints, the Mussulmans on Allah; the\r\ncaptain burst into tears and ran below deck, telling his passengers to\r\ncall on God: he rung his hands, and wept aloud, and being asked what\r\nhe could do, said he could do nothing. “Could he get back to the main\r\nland?” “If God chooses,” was his answer. “Could he make Corfu?” “If\r\nGod chooses.” One thinks of the testy old patrician’s rejoinder in\r\n“Coriolanus” to the tribune’s exclaimer, “The gods be good unto us!” “No;\r\nin such a case the gods will not be good unto us.” In Scott’s tale of\r\nthe Crusaders, “I will vow a golden candlestick to the Holy Sepulchre—a\r\nshrine of silver to our Lady of Engaddi—a pall, worth one hundred bezants\r\nto Saint Thomas of Orthez,” cries the Queen in extremity.—“Up, up,\r\nmadam,” says Edith; “call on the saints an you list, but be your own\r\nbest saint.” In “Ivanhoe,” again, when the Grand Master forbodes the\r\ncontingent extinction of his order (the Templars), “Now may God avert\r\nsuch a calamity!” says the Preceptor. “Amen!” rejoins the Grand Master,\r\nwith solemnity, “but we must deserve His aid.”\r\n\r\nIt is all in keeping with the practical character of the man, the\r\nprayer which on one critical occasion Benvenuto Cellini records his\r\noffering: “Almighty God, favour my cause, for Thou knowest it is a just\r\none, and that I am not on my part wanting in my utmost efforts to make\r\nit succeed.” On another he tells us how he “told Lionardo, who was\r\nincessantly crying out, ‘Jesus, Jesus!’ that Jesus would assist him, if\r\nhe strove to help himself.” Elsewhere again Cellini emphatically asserts\r\nhis systematic habit of “always exerting his utmost efforts to extricate”\r\nhimself from difficulty, as well as of devoutly recommending himself to\r\nGod, by whom alone those efforts could achieve success, and who so often\r\nhad delivered him when the best of these had clearly and entirely failed.\r\n\r\nSaintly as well as Saint Francis of Sales bids his brethren, “En toutes\r\nvos affaires, appuyez-vous totalement sur la providence de Dieu, par\r\nlaquelle seule tous vos desseins doivent réussir; travaillez néanmoins de\r\nvotre côté tout doucement pour co-opérer avec icelle.” The counsel is at\r\none, _au fond_, with that of the heathen stoic in the old play:—\r\n\r\n    “I am plain, fathers. Here you look about\r\n    One at another, doubting what to do,\r\n    With faces, as you trusted to the gods,\r\n    That still have saved you; and they can do it: but\r\n    They are not wishings, or base womanish prayers,\r\n    Can draw their aids; but vigilance, counsel, action;\r\n    Which they will be ashamed to forsake.\r\n    ’Tis sloth they hate, and cowardice.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_CO-OPERANT UNITS._\r\n\r\nEPHESIANS iv. 16.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe universal Church is designated by the apostle a body, which whole\r\nbody is fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint\r\nsupplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every\r\npart. And every part in its measure, and according to its imparted power.\r\nVery little are some of the joints and fibres; but every little helps.\r\nWho shall despise the whole of small things? But for the accumulated\r\natoms, the aggregated littles, where were the body?\r\n\r\n    “Let me not deem that I was made in vain,\r\n    Or that my Being was an accident,\r\n    Which Fate, in working its sublime intent,\r\n    Not wished to be, to hinder would not deign.\r\n    _Each drop uncounted in a storm of rain_\r\n    _Hath its own mission_, and is duly sent\r\n    To its own leaf or blade, not idly spent\r\n    ’Mid myriad dimples on the shipless main.\r\n    The very shadow of an insect’s wing,\r\n    For which the violet cared not while it stayed,\r\n    Yet felt the lighter for its vanishing,\r\n    Proved that the sun was shining by its shade:\r\n    Then can a drop of the eternal spring,\r\n    Shadow of living lights, in vain be made?”[38]\r\n\r\nAs the author of “Felix Holt” says, we see human heroism broken into\r\nunits, and are apt to imagine, this unit did little—might as well not\r\nhave been. But in this way we might break up a great army into units;\r\nin this way we might break the sunlight into fragments, and think that\r\nthis and the other might be cheaply parted with. “Let us rather raise a\r\nmonument to the soldiers whose brave hearts only kept the ranks unbroken,\r\nand met death—a monument to the faithful who were not famous, and who\r\nare precious as the continuity of the sunbeams is precious, though some\r\nof them fall unseen and on barrenness.” Suppose but a solution of that\r\ncontinuity; the sequel is, darkness that may be felt.\r\n\r\nThere is a latter-day apologue of a gimlet that grew exceedingly\r\ndiscontented with its vocation, envying all the other tools in the\r\ncarpenter’s basket, and thinking scorn of its own mean duty of\r\nperpetually boring and picking holes everywhere. “The saw and the axe had\r\ngrand work to do; and the plane got praise always; so did the chisel for\r\nits carving; and the happy hammer was always ringing merrily upon the\r\nclenching nail.” But for _it_, a wretched, poking, paltry, gimlet, its\r\nwork was hidden away, and very little seemed its recognised use. But the\r\ngimlet is assured, on the best authority, that nothing could compensate\r\nfor its absence, and is therefore bidden be content, nay happy; for\r\nthough its work seems mean and secret, it is indispensable. To its good\r\noffices, the workman is said to look chiefly for coherence without\r\nsplitting; and to its quiet influences, the neatness, the solidity, the\r\ncomfort of his structure may greatly be ascribed. The apologue has, of\r\ncourse, its practical application. “Are there not many pining gimlets\r\nin society, ambitious of the honour given to the greater-seeming tools\r\nof our Architect, but unconscious that in His hands they are quite as\r\nuseful? The loving little child, the gentle woman, the patience of many\r\na moral martyr, the diligence of many a duteous drudge, though their\r\nworks may be unseen and their virtues operate in obscurity, yet are these\r\nmain helpers to the very joints and bands of our body corporate, the\r\nquiet home influences whereby the great edifice, Society, is so nicely\r\nwainscoted and floored without split-boards.”\r\n\r\nTo recognise one’s being entrusted with but one talent, after all, and\r\nnot with five or with ten, as one’s vanity had previously taken for\r\ngranted, has even been hailed as, in some sort, a soothing sensation.\r\nWhen one of us who has been led by native vanity or senseless flattery,\r\nsays Dr. Holmes, to think himself or herself possessed of talent,\r\narrives at the full and final conclusion that he or she is really dull,\r\nit is one of the most tranquillizing and blessed convictions that can\r\nenter a mortal’s mind: “All our failures, our short-comings, our\r\nstrange disappointments in the effect of our efforts, are lifted from\r\nour bruised shoulders, and fall, like Christian’s pack, at the feet of\r\nthat Omnipotence which has seen fit to deny us the pleasant gifts of\r\nhigh intelligence,—with which one look may overflow us in some wider\r\nsphere of being.” That the one talent be employed, is the one thing\r\nneedful. So feels the girl in one of Charlotte Brontè’s tales, whose\r\nexclamation is, “Mother, the Lord who gave each of us our talents will\r\ncome home some day, and will demand from all an account. The tea-pot,\r\nthe old stocking-foot, the linen rag, the willow-pattern tureen, will\r\nyield up their barren deposit in many a house: suffer your daughters, at\r\nleast, to put their money to the exchangers, that they may be enabled\r\nat the Master’s coming to pay His own with usury.” A man is accepted\r\naccording to that he hath, not condemned in respect of what he never\r\nhad. Whatsoever his hand findeth to do, that is what a man is to do with\r\nhis might, to do with a will,—be it to govern a nation, or to dust a\r\nwarehouse. To apply a passage in Ben Jonson’s “Catiline,”\r\n\r\n    “They are no less part of the commonwealth\r\n    That do obey, than those that do command.”\r\n\r\nJohn Newton said that if two angels came down from heaven to execute\r\na Divine command, and one was appointed to conduct an empire, and the\r\nother to sweep a street in it, they would feel no inclination to change\r\nemployments. So again, the same robust divine affirmed that a Christian\r\nshould never plead spirituality for being a sloven; “if he be but a\r\nshoe-cleaner, he should be the best in the parish.” As the old servant\r\ntells Ruth, in Mrs. Gaskell’s story, “There’s a right and a wrong way\r\nof setting about everything—and to my thinking, the right way is to\r\ntake a thing up heartily, if it is only making a bed. Why, dear ah me!\r\nmaking a bed may be done after a Christian fashion, I take it, or else\r\nwhat’s to come of such as me in heaven, who’ve had little enough time on\r\nearth for clapping ourselves down on our knees for set prayers?” This\r\nquaint speaker had laid to heart the lesson once for all enforced upon\r\nher, to do her duty in that state of life to which it had pleased God to\r\ncall her; her station was that of a servant, and, looked at aright, as\r\nhonourable as a king’s: she was to help and serve others in one way, just\r\nas a king is in another. Her parting counsel to Ruth runs thus: “Just try\r\nfor a day to think of all the odd jobs as to be done well and truly in\r\nGod’s sight, not just slurred over any how, and you’ll go through them\r\ntwice as cheerfully,” besides doing them more efficiently. John Brown,\r\nof Haddington, being waited on by a lad of excitable temperament, who\r\ninformed him of his desire to become a preacher, and whom the shrewd\r\npastor saw to be as weak in intellect as he was strong in conceit,\r\nadvised him to continue in his present vocation. The young man said,\r\n“But I wish to preach and glorify God.” The old commentator replied,\r\n“My young friend, a man may glorify God making broom besoms; stick to\r\nyour trade, and glorify God by your life and conversation.” As it was\r\nsaid of Bossuet, in the seventeenth century, that he could not walk,\r\nor sit down, or even pluck a currant, without your recognising in him\r\nthe great bishop (so asserts a modern French divine, not of Bossuet’s\r\nchurch), just so the workman and the domestic servant who are animated\r\nby their Master’s spirit, distinguish themselves among their fellows\r\nby a certain air of nobility; under their blouse or their livery may\r\nbe seen to shine the signal light of their _aristocratie spirituelle_,\r\nthe image of the Most High Himself. However mean their employment,\r\nthey go about it with neither disgust nor indifference; but with an\r\nintelligent interest, because, in the sight of God, and indeed in their\r\nown eyes, their occupation is on a level with that of king or emperor.\r\nWhat constitutes the difference between man and man, is not, urges M.\r\nColani, the wielding a sceptre or plying a needle, but the being loyal\r\nto the trust, be it great or small, committed to us. This, he contends,\r\nis the only true point of view from which men and women should regard\r\ntheir occupations,—they should consider themselves as _collaborateurs\r\ndu Tout-Puissant_. If their work seem the reverse of noble, let them\r\nennoble it by this thought, in Wordsworth’s phrase,—\r\n\r\n    “And with the lofty sanctify the low.”\r\n\r\nA Christian nursemaid is pictured, forgetting the thousand _désagréments_\r\nof her humble functions, and reminding herself that in reality she is\r\nin charge of souls, as much as pastor or preacher is, and this _grande\r\nconviction_ suffices to save her from servile dejection. So, again, the\r\nartisan and day labourer may be sustained by the Spirit from on high,\r\nand taught to magnify their calling, in a deep and a wide sense, because\r\nit is what they are called to, and because they respond to the call, in\r\nthe spirit of it. They are toilers co-operant to an end; and the end,\r\nthe result, is with God. “They also serve who only stand and wait.” But\r\nthe whole sonnet of Milton’s which closes with that grand line, is too\r\ngermane to the matter, and too largely suggestive in its main issue,\r\nto be omitted here; the sonnet which the blind poet wrote touching his\r\nblindness:—\r\n\r\n    “When I consider how my light is spent,\r\n    Ere half my days, in this dark world and wide,\r\n    And that one talent which is death to hide,\r\n    Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent\r\n    To serve therewith my Maker, and present\r\n    My true account, lest He, returning, chide;\r\n    ‘Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?’\r\n    I fondly ask: but Patience, to prevent\r\n    That murmur, soon replies, ‘God doth not need\r\n    Either man’s work, or His own gifts; who best\r\n    Bear his mild yoke, they serve Him best; His state\r\n    Is kingly; thousands at His bidding speed,\r\n    And post o’er land and ocean without rest;\r\n    They also serve who only stand and wait.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_SUBORDINATE, NOT SUPERFLUOUS; OR, DEPRECIATED MEMBERSHIP._\r\n\r\n1 CORINTHIANS xii. 22.\r\n\r\n\r\nStrenuously St. Paul insists on the importance of not overlooking\r\nthe feebler members of the body—be it physical, politic, or\r\necclesiastical,—and of upholding their rights to due consideration, on\r\nthe mere score of membership. Subordinate they may be, but superfluous\r\nthey are not. The body would not be a body without them. “Nay, much more,\r\nthose members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary.”\r\n“Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.” If all were\r\none member, where were the body? But now are they many members, but one\r\nbody. And one member differeth from another in honour; yet, without the\r\nseeming minor and meaner ones, for all the abundant honour of the greater\r\nones, where were the body?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHuman society, it has been said, is a vast and intricate machine,\r\ncomposed of innumerable wheels and pulleys:—every one has his special\r\nhandle to grind at; some with great and obvious effects, others with\r\nlittle or no assignable result; but if the object ultimately produced\r\nby the combined efforts of all is in itself a good one, it is not to\r\nbe denied that whatever is essential to its production is good also.\r\nHuman society is thus regarded as a body corporate, made up of different\r\nmembers, each of which has its own special function: one class tilling\r\nthe ground, another combining and distributing its produce, a third\r\nmaking, and a fourth executing laws, and so on, through every class of\r\nsociety. “If all these functions are properly discharged, the whole\r\nbody corporate is in a healthy condition; and thence it follows that\r\nwhoever contributes to the full and proper discharge of any one of these\r\nfunctions, is contributing to the general good of the whole body; so that\r\na person occupied in them is doing good in the strictest sense of the\r\nwords.” An able discourser on social subjects, arguing against a current\r\ncrotchet, utterly denies that a girl in a respectable family does not\r\nearn the honourable title of a worker, though she be only employed in\r\nassisting in house-keeping and at the family work-table, just as fairly\r\nand as completely as if she walked to a solicitor’s office for an eight\r\nhours’ daily task of copying briefs and making out bills of costs.\r\n\r\n    “They work in spirit who for service wait.”\r\n\r\nFrederick Robertson glowingly expatiates on the glory of womanhood, as\r\nsurely one which, if woman rightly comprehended her place on earth, might\r\nenable her to accept its apparent humiliation unrepiningly; the glory,\r\nas he defines it, of unsensualizing coarse and common things, sensual\r\nthings, the objects of mere sense, meat and drink and household cares,\r\nelevating them by the spirit in which she ministers them, into something\r\ntransfigured and sublime. “The humblest mother of a poor family, who is\r\ncumbered with much serving, or watching over a hospitality which she is\r\ntoo poor to delegate to others, or toiling for love’s sake in household\r\nwork, needs no emancipation in God’s sight. It is the prerogative and the\r\nglory of her womanhood to consecrate the meanest things by a ministry\r\nwhich is not for self.” What hundreds and thousands of female invalids\r\nhave felt, and almost in the same words said, with Lucy Aikin, when\r\nenfeebled with age and other ailments, “The thought which sits heavy\r\non my mind is that of my own inutility. Alas! what important end of\r\nexistence do I fulfil? To whom is it of any real consequence whether or\r\nnot I continue to fill a place in the world? I hope that involuntary\r\nuselessness will not be imputed, and that we may say, ‘They also serve\r\nwho only stand and wait.’” A fellow-worker of the same sex, but made of\r\nsterner stuff, in the dedication of a book written in illness, tells her\r\nfriend, “You know, as well as I, how withering would be the sense of\r\nour own nothingness, if we tried to take comfort from our own dignity\r\nand usefulness.” And she goes on to say how ridiculous, if it were not\r\nshocking, would be any complacency on the ground of having followed the\r\ninstincts of her nature to work, while work was possible,—the issues of\r\nsuch divinely appointed instrumentality being wholly brought out and\r\ndirected by Him who framed and actuated her. To apply the words of Aurora\r\nLeigh:—\r\n\r\n                ... “Though we fail indeed,—\r\n    You, I, a score of such weak-workers,—He\r\n    Fails never. If He cannot work by us,\r\n    He will work over us. Does He want a man,\r\n    Much less a woman, think you? Every time\r\n    The star winks there, so many souls are born,\r\n    Who all shall work too. Let our own be calm:\r\n    We should be ashamed to sit beneath those stars,\r\n    Impatient that we’re nothing.”\r\n\r\nSo Mrs. Browning. And pitched in the self-same key is this stanza of her\r\nhusband’s:—\r\n\r\n    “All service ranks the same with God:\r\n    If now, as formerly He trod\r\n    Paradise, His presence fills\r\n    Our earth, each only as God wills\r\n    Can work—God’s puppets, best and worst,\r\n    Are we; there is no last nor first.”\r\n\r\nWordsworth is eloquently suggestive in those prefatory lines of his,\r\nwhich weave a moral and infer a solace, from the fact, that the stars\r\npre-eminent in magnitude, and they that from the zenith dart their beams,\r\nare yet of no diviner origin, no purer essence, than the one he watched\r\nfrom Rydal Mount, burning like an untended watch-fire on the ridge of\r\nsome dark hill-top; or than those which seem\r\n\r\n    “Humbly to hang, like twinkling winter lamps,\r\n    Among the branches of the leafless trees;\r\n    All are the undying offspring of one Sire.\r\n    Then, to the measure of the light vouchsafed,\r\n    Shine, poet, in thy place, and be content.”\r\n\r\nIf we weave a yard of tape in all humility, says Emerson, and as well\r\nas we can, long hereafter we shall see that it was “no cotton tape at\r\nall, but some galaxy which we braided, and that the threads were Time\r\nand Nature.” Without number, as Archdeacon Hare puts it, are the sutlers\r\nand pioneers, the engineers and artisans, who attend the march of\r\nintellect; many of them busied in building and fitting up and painting\r\nand emblazoning the chariot; others in lessening the friction of the\r\nwheels; while others move forward in detachments, and level the way\r\nit is to pass over, and cut down the obstacles which would impede its\r\nprogress. And these too, he proceeds to say, “have their reward. If so be\r\nthey labour diligently in their calling, not only will they enjoy that\r\ncalm contentment which diligence in the lowliest task never fails to win;\r\nnot only will the sweat of their brows be sweet, and the sweetener of\r\nthe rest that follows; but, when the victory is at last achieved, they\r\ncome in for a share of the glory; even as the meanest soldier who fought\r\nat Marathon or at Leipsic became a sharer in the glory of those saving\r\ndays.” Remember, with Owen Meredith,—\r\n\r\n    “Remember, every man God made\r\n      Is different: has some deed to do,\r\n    Some work to work. Be undismay’d\r\n      Though thine be humble: do it too.”\r\n\r\nAn elder teacher would qualify the Remember by a Do not forget, that “it\r\nmatters infinitely less what we _do_ than what we _are_.” If we cannot\r\npursue a trade or a science—says a memorable voice from a sick-room,—if\r\nwe cannot keep house, or help the state, or write books, or earn our own\r\nbread or that of others, we can do the work to which all this is only\r\nsubsidiary; “we can cherish a sweet and holy temper; we can vindicate\r\nthe supremacy of mind over body; we can, in defiance of our liabilities,\r\nminister pleasure and hope to the gayest who come prepared to receive\r\npain from the spectacle of our pain; we can, here as well as in heaven’s\r\ncourts hereafter, reveal the angel growing into its immortal aspect,\r\nwhich is the highest achievement we could propose to ourselves, or that\r\ngrace from above, could propose to us, if we had a free choice of all\r\npossible conditions of human life.”\r\n\r\nTo all those possible conditions, so manifold in their potentialities,\r\nthe doctrine applies. The membership is a constant quantity. _Nil me\r\nofficit unquam_, says Horace, _Ditior hic, aut est quia doctior; est\r\nlocus uni Cuique suus_. And we have Shakspeare’s word for it, that nought\r\nso vile upon the earth doth live, but to the earth some special good doth\r\ngive; and though he is speaking of stones and the like, are there not\r\nsermons in stones, as well as good in everything?\r\n\r\nHoly George Herbert shall furnish us with a versicle to the purpose. As\r\never, he is looking upwards when he says,—\r\n\r\n      “Indeed the world’s Thy book\r\n    Where all things have their leaf assign’d:\r\n              Yet a meek look\r\n              Hath interlined.\r\n    Thy board is full, yet humble guests\r\n                              Find nests.”\r\n\r\nBut more pertinent, and less quaintly obscure, is that stanza from\r\nanother little lyric of his, in which the Country Parson exalts the\r\nexalting power of a simple trust in God and devotion to His service:\r\n\r\n    “A servant with this clause\r\n        Makes drudgery divine:\r\n    Who sweeps a room, as for Thy laws,\r\n        Makes that and the action fine.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE WRATH-DISPELLING POWER OF A SOFT ANSWER._\r\n\r\nPROVERBS xv. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile it is the effect, if not the end and aim, of grievous words to\r\nstir up anger,—“a soft answer turneth away wrath.” Though “the wrath of\r\na king is as messengers of death, a wise man will pacify it.” “By long\r\nforbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.”\r\n\r\nWhen the men of Ephraim, enraged at Gideon’s failing to invoke their aid\r\nwhen he went to fight with the Midianites, chided with him sharply, his\r\nsoft answer was of instant avail to turn away their wrath. What had he\r\ndone now in comparison of them? the champion deferentially exclaimed; and\r\nwhat was he able to do in comparison of them? Was not the mere gleaning\r\nof the grapes of Ephraim better than the entire vintage of Abi-ezer?\r\n“Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.” What\r\nthreatened to be a very bone of contention,—well, so soft a tongue as\r\nthat of Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, breaketh the bone.\r\n\r\nDiscussing Lord Aberdeen’s settlement of the vexed question of the right\r\nof search, in 1843, the historian of Europe observes that never was\r\nthere a truer maxim than that it requires the consent of two persons to\r\nmake a quarrel; a soft word, a seasonable explanation, often turns aside\r\nwrath, and sometimes prevents the most serious wars that threaten to\r\ndevastate the world. Æsop Smith says he never knew a downright quarrel\r\nyet, where two people were not in the wrong; “drop your battledore, and\r\nthe shuttlecock will fall. ‘A soft answer turneth away wrath.’ No doubt\r\nit does, in nine cases out of ten,”—but not quite always, this authority\r\naffirms; there being some unreasonable quarrellers, who will batter\r\nthe peacemaker when he drops his battledore. But as a rule, and on the\r\nauthority of an older and still more widely recognised maker of proverbs,\r\nthe mere fact of yielding pacifieth great offences.\r\n\r\nThe historian of the conquest of Peru tells us how Gasca was assailed by\r\nreproaches and invectives which, however, had no power to disturb his\r\nequanimity; he patiently listened, and replied to all in the mild tone of\r\nexpostulation best calculated to turn away wrath. “By this victory over\r\nhimself,” says Garcilasso, “he acquired more real glory, than by all his\r\nvictories over his foes.” As Spenser has it,—\r\n\r\n                  “Words well-disposed\r\n    Have secret power t’ appease inflamèd rage.”\r\n\r\nSir Matthew Hale’s celebrated letter of advice includes this counsel,—if\r\na person be passionate, and give you ill language, rather to pity him\r\nthan be moved to anger. We shall find, the pious judge asserts, that\r\nsilence, or very gentle words, are the most exquisite revenge for\r\nreproaches; they will either cure the distemper in the angry man, and\r\nmake him sorry for his passion, or they will be a severe reproof and\r\npunishment to him. “But at any rate,” adds Sir Matthew, “they will\r\npreserve your innocence, give you the deserved reputation of wisdom and\r\nmoderation, and keep up the serenity and composure of your mind. Passion\r\nand anger make a man unfit for everything that becomes him as a man or as\r\na Christian.”\r\n\r\nThe fact is, maintains the author of “The Gentle Life,” all hard words\r\nare a mistake: most of our quarrels arise from a total misunderstanding\r\nof each other; and at any rate, hard words will not mend the matter.\r\nOne might as well, he says, try to mend glass windows by pelting them\r\nwith stones. Soft words, on the other hand, fall like a healing balm on\r\nthe hearts of all. “Such power,” in the words of one who loved to be\r\nwritten, if not to write himself, Leontius, “such power has the least\r\nshadow of a pleasant speech, to do away an ill-feeling of the moment, in\r\nthe complacency it produces, both in the giver and receiver.” To apply,\r\nagain, a passage from Spenser, descriptive of a damsel’s success in\r\ndeterring two doughty knights from mortal encounter, so effective was her\r\nspeech to\r\n\r\n        ... “calm the sea of their tempestuous spite:\r\n    Such power have pleasing words! Such is the might\r\n    Of courteous clemency in gentle heart!”\r\n\r\nWe are all of us fond of gentle words, once more to quote an _ex titulo_\r\nauthority on all that concerns gentle living; and he denies the truth\r\nof the common rough proverb, “Soft words butter no parsnips,” which is\r\nshown to be, after all, an apologetic proverb, meaning that the hearer\r\nis tickled with the politeness, albeit real satisfaction is not yet\r\nmade. “Soft words do butter parsnips; and many an oily fellow, whose\r\ntalent, industry, and conscientiousness are small, owes his position and\r\nadvancement in life to the soft words which drop continually from his\r\nmouth.” The soft answer that avails to dispel wrath, comes of practised\r\npatience; and when patience has its perfect work, it works miracles, as\r\ndetailed by that fine old forgotten poet, Decker:—\r\n\r\n    “It is the greatest enemy to law\r\n    That can be, for it doth embrace all wrongs,\r\n    And so chains up lawyers and women’s tongues;\r\n    ...\r\n    And last of all, to end a household strife,\r\n    It is the honey ’gainst a waspish wife.”\r\n\r\nThis reminds us of a passage in “The Gordian Knot,” where the gentle\r\nlaying of a husband’s hand in an irritated wife’s, or _vice versâ_, is\r\nrecommended (by example) as a good plan to adopt in conjugal discussions\r\nwhen differences arise. The tongue, says our author, is very proud,\r\nabominably proud and sulky, and often refuses to say what the heart\r\ndesires should be said; but the fingers know their duty, and are ready\r\nto convey an apologetic or forgiving pressure, which, he makes bold to\r\nassert, “will stop ninety-nine quarrels out of a hundred, if the parties\r\nlove one another.”\r\n\r\nThe greatest, widest, deepest of all observers of human nature puts into\r\nthe mouth of one of the sagest of kings this counsel to a younger son, in\r\nrespect to his bearing towards the elder:—\r\n\r\n          ... “Blunt not his love; ...\r\n    For he is gracious, if he be observed;[39]\r\n    Yet notwithstanding, being incensed, he’s flint:\r\n    As humorous as winter, and as sudden\r\n    As flaws[40] congealed in the spring of day.\r\n    His temper, therefore, must be well observed:\r\n    Chide him for faults, and do it reverently,\r\n    When you perceive his blood inclined to mirth:\r\n    But being moody, give him line and scope;\r\n    Till that his passions, like a whale on ground,\r\n    Confound themselves with working.”\r\n\r\nIn a later one, again, of his noble series of English history\r\nplays—indeed the latest—Shakspeare makes a ducal politician, astute in\r\npractical psychology as well as in politics, utter this apophthegm, of\r\nhis own coinage:—\r\n\r\n                  “Anger is like\r\n    A full-hot horse, who being allowed his way,\r\n    Self-mettle tires him.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A TWICE-TOLD TALE OF YEARS._\r\n\r\nECCLESIASTES vi. 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preacher, whose text was Vanity of vanities, all is vanity, pictures\r\nin one section of his homily a man who has lived many years, “so that\r\nthe days of his years be many,” but whose soul is not filled with good,\r\nbut aches rather with a gnawing sense of emptiness, so that his many\r\nyears, gloomy as they have been, are all too few. “Yea, though he live a\r\nthousand years twice told, yet hath he seen no good: do not all go to one\r\nplace?” What more tedious than such a twice-told tale of years? Yet, to\r\nlook back upon, how fleet their transit, how imperceptible their lapse,\r\nhow petty the sum of them! That tale is soon told, even if told twice.\r\n\r\nThe days of our life are threescore years and ten, and though men be so\r\nstrong that they come to fourscore years, yet is their strength then but\r\nlabour and sorrow; nor do the fourscore seem longer to the retrospective\r\nreviewer than do to the sexagenarian his sixty years, or to the\r\nseptuagenarian his threescore and ten. The most popular of contemporary\r\nauthors describes a man of seventy-eight, of whom a loveless,\r\nsad-hearted questioner asks whether his seventy-eight years would not be\r\nseventy-eight heavy curses, if he could say to himself, as the questioner\r\ncan, “I have secured to myself the love and attachment, the gratitude or\r\nrespect, of no human creature; I have won myself a tender place in no\r\nregard; I have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by.” The\r\nRoyal Preacher would apply context as well as text to such a retrospect,\r\nwith an “I say, that an untimely birth is better than he. For he cometh\r\nin with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name shall be covered\r\nwith darkness. Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known anything:\r\nthis hath more rest than the other. Yea, though he live a thousand years\r\ntwice told, yet hath he seen no good.”\r\n\r\nThe same questioner, already cited, asks the same old man if his\r\nchildhood seems far off,—if the days when he sat at his mother’s knee\r\nseem days of very long ago? To which the experience of threescore and\r\neighteen years gives this reply: “Twenty years back, yes: at this time\r\nof my life, no. For, as I draw closer and closer to the end, I travel\r\nin the circle, nearer and nearer to the beginning.” But he is not one\r\nto feel and say with the French cynic, “Mais enfin la vie se passe, et\r\nmourir après s’être amusé ou s’être ennuyé dix ou vingt ans, c’est la\r\nmême chose.” He has not so learned life, and the meaning of life, and its\r\npurpose, and its end.\r\n\r\nInfinite is the swiftness of time, says Seneca, as seen by those who\r\nare looking back at time past. _Infinita est velocitas temporis, quæ\r\nmagis apparet respicientibus._ Looked forward to, it is another matter\r\naltogether. As Cowper has it, when retracing the windings of his way\r\nthrough many years,—\r\n\r\n    “Short as in retrospect the journey seems,\r\n    It seemed not always short; the rugged path,\r\n    And prospect oft so dreary and forlorn,\r\n    Moved many a sigh at its disheartening length.”\r\n\r\nBut as Cowper elsewhere draws the contrast, in the Latin motto he wrote\r\nfor the king’s clock,—\r\n\r\n    “Quæ lenta accedit, quam velox præterit hora!”\r\n\r\n(Slow comes the hour; its passing speed how great!—so Hayley Englished\r\nthe line.) “Since this new epoch in my life,” writes Schleiermacher on a\r\ncertain occasion, “time seems to fly twice as quickly as before, and I\r\ncan quite fancy that when Jatte and I are grown old and grey, we shall\r\nstill feel as if only a few days had gone by.” Moore was in his sixtieth\r\nyear when Lord John Russell talked with him of the speed with which time\r\nseems to fly; and Moore records in his Diary the question he put, “If you\r\nfind it so now, what will you say of it when you are as old as I am?”\r\nThe “peculiar melancholy” of the answer given is emphasised in the same\r\njournal.\r\n\r\nAnother retrospective reviewer pictures our race as struggling ever\r\nonward, toiling up towards some air-built goal never to be attained—while\r\nthe past crumbles instantly away behind our steps, like the staircase of\r\nthe Epicurean, as we advance in our progress; and every step, which was\r\nof such magnitude when we passed it, is forgotten in the “collectiveness\r\nof retrospection,” insomuch that at times a passing thought would compass\r\nthe events of years.\r\n\r\nFew and evil the patriarch declares the days of the years of his\r\npilgrimage to have been, when, in answer to Pharaoh’s “How old art\r\nthou?” the answer is, A hundred and thirty years. Man that is born of a\r\nwoman is of few days, said another patriarch, and full of trouble. His\r\ndays are swifter than a post, they flee away, they see no good. They\r\nare passed away as the swift ships; they are swifter than a weaver’s\r\nshuttle. _Festinat enim decurrere velox Flosculus angustæ miseræque\r\nbrevissima vitæ Portio._ And thus in Juvenal’s pregnant phrase, _obrepit\r\nnon intellecta senectus_. Or, as with the ageing subject of the Three\r\nWarnings,—\r\n\r\n    “Old Time whose haste no mortal spares,\r\n    Uncalled, unheeded, unawares,\r\n    Brought him on his eightieth year.”\r\n\r\nWe bring our years to an end, as it were a tale that is told.\r\n\r\nIn one of his letters to his old friend Mrs. Hughes, Southey commences\r\na paragraph with the truism, “The last twenty years, to you and me, are\r\nbut as yesterday;” and he adds, that if we could but bring ourselves\r\nto feel, as truly as we know, that the next twenty years are but as\r\nto-morrow, that feeling, with a trust in God’s mercy, would be sufficient\r\nconsolation under all sorrows. Half a year later we find him writing\r\nto her in the same strain: “It seems but as yesterday when I look back\r\ntwenty, thirty, forty, and even more years; the end, therefore, of my\r\nmortal term would seem but as to-morrow if it were rightly looked on to.\r\nA little while, and we shall be young again, beyond all power of time\r\nand change, with those whom we love, and to continue with them for ever\r\nand ever.” Madame de Sévigné utters her pure French hélas! over the like\r\nretrospect of twenty years: “Hélas! est-il possible qu’il y ait vingt-un\r\nans? il me esembleque ce fut l’année passée; mais je juge, par le peu que\r\nm’a duré ce temps, ce que me paraîtront les années qui viendront encore.”\r\nHome, straight home to every heart comes the homely moral of the bard\r\naddressing the busy, curious, thirsty fly he freely welcomed to his cup,\r\nand whose little life he compared with his longer yet little own:—\r\n\r\n    “Both alike are mine and thine,\r\n    Hastening quick to their decline:\r\n    Thine’s a summer, mine no more,\r\n    Though repeated to threescore;\r\n    Threescore summers, when they’re gone,\r\n    Will appear as short as one.”\r\n\r\nIf for threescore we read fourscore, it would not mar the metre, or the\r\nrhyme or reason.\r\n\r\nMan is never so deluded as when he dreams of his own duration, says\r\nCowper; and he goes on to cite Jacob’s retrospective reviewal of years\r\nelapsed: “The answer of the old patriarch to Pharaoh may be adapted by\r\nevery man at the close of the longest life. ‘Few and evil have been the\r\ndays of the years of my pilgrimage.’ Whether we look back from fifty or\r\nfrom twice fifty, the past equally appears a dream; and we can only be\r\nsaid truly to have lived while we have been profitably employed.” And as\r\nthe sovereign lady of French letter-writers has her Hélas! so one of the\r\nprinces among English letter-writers has his Alas! to utter on this trite\r\ntopic, “Alas, then, making the necessary deductions, how short is life!”\r\nThough the life be made up of a thousand years twice told, the tale is\r\ntold so soon, and the teller seems to himself but as a dreamer, and his\r\nlittle life is rounded with a sleep; like as a dream when one awaketh.\r\n\r\nThe good emperor Marcus Antoninus, one of those whom a broad\r\nchurchmanship is free and fain to recognise as Seekers after God, is\r\ntaken to intimate that the difference between a so-called long and a\r\nshort life is insignificant, in regard of Eternity, when he indites this\r\naphorism, among his Meditations: “When frankincense is thrown upon the\r\naltar, one grain usually falls before another; but then the distance of\r\ntime is of no moment.” The moments, so to speak, of difference, are not\r\nmomentous. Do not all go to one place?\r\n\r\nBut in the issue, all depends on the using. Happy the few and evil years\r\nof a patriarch, if a patriarch indeed, of a pilgrim going home. Be they\r\nfew and evil in one sense, or in another very many,—\r\n\r\n    “They will appear like moments when he soars\r\n    Beyond those sunbreaks.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDAYBREAK NO SOLACE: NIGHTFALL NO RELIEF.\r\n\r\nDEUTERONOMY xxviii. 36, 37.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot the least impressive of the afflictions denounced against a disloyal\r\npeople, in the book Deuteronomy, is that which should make day and night\r\na fear and a trouble to them; so that in the morning they should say,\r\n“Would God it were even!” and at even, “Would God it were morning!”\r\nThere is at once terrible realism and suggestiveness in words but too\r\nfamiliar to most who have themselves suffered, or watched by the couch\r\nof sleepless suffering. Job utters a complaint of wearisome nights as\r\nappointed to him; so that when he lay down, he said, “When shall I arise,\r\nand the night be gone?” and thus was he full of tossings to and fro unto\r\nthe dawning of the day. Like the Psalmist, he cried in the daytime, but\r\nit seemed that God heard not; and in the night season he was not silent,\r\nbut it seemed as though from above there was neither voice, nor any to\r\nanswer, nor any that regarded. In such cases, one day telleth another of\r\nseeming desolation; and one night certifieth another almost of despair.\r\nAnd the eventide is longed for in broad daylight, if haply, with mere\r\nchange, it may bring relief. But when it has set in, and eve has saddened\r\ninto night, there is wearying for daybreak, as possibly the bringer of a\r\nboon that, however, it fails to bring.\r\n\r\nA stanza in one of Shakspeare’s poems contains an example to the purpose:—\r\n\r\n    “Thus ebbs and flows the current of her sorrow,\r\n      And time doth weary time with her complaining:\r\n    She looks for night, and then she longs for morrow;\r\n      And both she thinks too long with her remaining:\r\n      Short time seems long in sorrow’s sharp sustaining.\r\n    Though woe be heavy, yet it seldom sleeps;\r\n    And they that watch, see time how slow it creeps.”\r\n\r\nAnd thus runs one of Landor’s imitations from the Greek, of an address to\r\nHesperus:—\r\n\r\n    “I have beheld thee in the morning hour,\r\n      A solitary star, with thankless eyes,\r\n      Ungrateful as I am! who bade thee rise\r\n    When sleep all night had wandered from my bower.”\r\n\r\nOne of, and not the least fearful of, the curses denounced against\r\nByron’s Manfred is, that to him shall Night deny all the quiet of her\r\nsky; and the day shall have a sun which shall make him wish it done.\r\nCrabbe’s Tale of Edward Shore has to tell how, at one stage of that\r\nsombre career,—\r\n\r\n    “Struck by new terrors, from his friends he fled,\r\n    And wept his woes upon a restless bed;\r\n    Retiring late, at early hour to rise,\r\n    With shrunken features, and with bloodshot eyes;\r\n    If sleep one moment closed the dismal view,\r\n    Fancy her terrors built upon the true;\r\n    And night and day had their alternate woes,\r\n    That baffled pleasure, and that mocked repose.”\r\n\r\nThe hero of one popular prose fiction describes himself as lying awake\r\nnight after night, quivering with his great sorrow—wishing that the\r\nfirst dull grey of morning would appear at the window; and when it came,\r\nlonging for night and darkness once more. Of the heroine in another we\r\nread that “the terrible ‘demon of the bed,’ that invests our lightest\r\nsorrows with such hopeless and crushing anxiety, reigned triumphant\r\nover its gentle victim; and yet, when the daylight crept through her\r\nuncurtained windows, she shrunk from it, as though in her broken spirit\r\nshe preferred to hide her distress in the gloom of night, fearful and\r\nunrelieved as was its dark dominion.” How sickening, how dark, exclaims\r\nKeats, in the fantastic diction of “Endymion,” “the dreadful leisure\r\nof weary days, made deeper exquisite by a foreknowledge of unslumbrous\r\nnight!” Mr. Tennyson pictures to us the simple maid Elaine, who went half\r\nthe night repeating, Must she die?\r\n\r\n    “And now to right she turned, and now to left,\r\n      And found no ease in turning or in rest”—\r\n\r\nlike one of those depicted by Keble—\r\n\r\n        “... who darkling and alone,\r\n    Would wish the weary night were gone,\r\n    Though dawning morn should only show\r\n    The secret of their unknown woe.”\r\n\r\nShelley sings of the desire “of the night for the morrow” when expressing\r\nthe devotion to something afar from the sphere of our sorrow. Gray\r\nvividly depicts the state of mind of one who—\r\n\r\n    “... starts from short slumbers, and wishes for morning—\r\n    To close his dull eyes when he sees it returning.”\r\n\r\nOf Mrs. Gaskell’s Jemima we read, that “the night, the sleepless night,\r\nwas so crowded and haunted by miserable images, that she longed for day;\r\nand when day came, with its stinging realities, she wearied and grew sick\r\nfor the solitude of night.” So with Shenstone’s Jessie:—\r\n\r\n    “Amid the dreary gloom of night I cry,\r\n      When will the morn’s once pleasing scenes return?\r\n    Yet what can morn’s returning ray supply,\r\n      But foes that triumph, or but friends that mourn?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_BUYER’S BARGAIN AND BOAST._\r\n\r\nPROVERBS xx. 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidering what goes to make up a proverb, it would be strange if,\r\nin the book of Proverbs, part though it be of holy writ, there should\r\nbe no touches of the humorous, however restrained and dignified its\r\nmanifestation. Shrewd insight into character, finding expression\r\nin phrases of homely vigour, or tranquil irony, or two-edged\r\nsarcasm,—without much of this, what were a book of proverbs? Assuredly\r\nthe collected proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel, are\r\nnot careful to eschew a touch of humour when the subject invites, or\r\nallows of, not to say requires it. Such a subject we have, and such a\r\ntouch of the jocose, in a verse which sets forth so tersely the tactics\r\nof traffickers and bargain-makers; how the bidder depreciates the wares\r\nhe is bidding for, until they are his; and how he alters his tone then,\r\nand brags at once of their superior worth, and of his own superior skill\r\nin effecting a purchase. He haggles, and beats them down, and pooh-poohs\r\nthem, as all but unsaleable, while yet they are on sale; but so soon as\r\nthe bargain is struck, he goes on his way rejoicing, and perhaps calls\r\nhis kinsfolk and acquaintance together, to rejoice with him, for he has\r\nbought dirt cheap what was worth its weight in gold. “It is naught, it is\r\nnaught, saith the buyer; but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.”\r\n\r\nThe Paris of “Troilus and Cressida” compliments, or, as may be, upbraids\r\na subtle Greek with his dexterity in this line of policy:—\r\n\r\n    “Fair Diomede, you do as chapmen do,\r\n    Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy.”\r\n\r\nIn measure with the intending buyer’s dispraise, is kept up by the\r\nwould-be seller a song of praise. As Horace has it, _Laudat venales\r\nqui vult extrudere merces_; and the laudation is apt to be in inverse\r\nproportion to the intrinsic worth of his wares. Good wine may need no\r\nbush; but bad wine, on that showing, may need one as big as a tree; and\r\nthe wine merchant is equal to the occasion.\r\n\r\nA. K. H. B. has said of men in towns, aware of the value of time, that\r\nby long experience they are assured of the uselessness of trying to\r\noverreach a neighbour in a bargain, because he is so sharp that they\r\nwill not succeed. But in agricultural districts such practical essayists\r\nin the art of overreaching are declared to be common enough and to\r\nspare; and it is one of the Recreations of the Country Parson aforenamed\r\n(initially at least) to mark out in detail the course which these\r\nbargain-makers are alleged invariably to follow. “If they wish to buy a\r\ncow or rent a field, they begin by declaring with frequency and vehemence\r\nthat they don’t want the thing,—that in fact they would rather not have\r\nit,—that it would be inconvenient for them to become possessors of it.\r\nThey then go on to say that still, if they can get it at a fair price,\r\nthey may be induced to think of it. They next declare that the cow is\r\nthe very worst that ever was seen, and that very few men would have such\r\na creature in their possession.” And so on,—till the strenuous haggler,\r\nafter wasting two hours, telling sixty-five lies, and stamping himself\r\nas a cheat, ends the negotiation, without taking anything at all by his\r\npetty trickery, so complicated and so clumsy withal in its convolutions.\r\n\r\nIt is in his estimate of the real merits of English horses, that\r\nFuller discreetly observes, in meting out temperate but cordial praise\r\nof their good points, “And whilst the seller praiseth them too much,\r\nthe buyer too little, the indifferent stander-by will give them their\r\ndue commendation.” What was true of horseflesh and its breeders and\r\npurchasers, in old Fuller’s day holds good still. Type of a large class\r\nis that manœuvring major in a popular fiction, of whom, and of his,\r\n“bargains” in the stable—mostly sedate, elderly animals—we read, that\r\ncertainly, if the animals could have spoken, they would have expressed\r\ntheir surprise at the difference in the language used by the major when a\r\nbuyer and when a seller; for while, as a buyer, he made them out to be,\r\nlike Gil Blas’ mule, all faults, as a seller he suddenly came round to\r\nbelieve in them as paragons of perfection.\r\n\r\nLeigh Hunt records as his experience of the Italians at home, that to\r\ncheat you through thick and thin was the universal endeavour—so that a\r\nperpetual warfare was inevitable, in which you were obliged to fight in\r\nself-defence. “If you paid anybody what he asked you, it never entered\r\ninto his imagination that you did it from anything but folly. You were\r\npronounced a _minchione_ (a ninny), one of their greatest terms of\r\nreproach. On the other hand, if you battled well through the bargain,\r\na perversion of the natural principle of self-defence led to a feeling\r\nof respect for you.” Dispute might increase, it is added; the man might\r\ngrin, stare, threaten; might pour out torrents of argument and of\r\n“injured innocence,” as they always do; but be firm, and he went away\r\nequally angry and admiring. “Did anybody condescend to take them in,\r\nthe admiration as well as the anger was still in proportion, like that\r\nof the gallant knights of old when they were beaten in single combat.”\r\nSuch chaffering, or “prigging,” as Burns calls it (in his satiric touch\r\nat town councillors waddling down the street, in all the pomp of ignorant\r\nconceit,—\r\n\r\n    “Men wha grew wise prigging owre hops and raisins),”\r\n\r\nsuch haggling, and stickling, and demurring, and deferring, are too truly\r\nsaid to distinguish the British system of arranging settlements—in which,\r\nembodying completely the Oriental theory of marriage, a woman is dealt\r\nwith “as a valuable security, to be exchanged for due consideration.”\r\nA marriage conducted according to the approved principles is therefore\r\n“a matter of sharp, close bargaining. No sooner is the romantic part\r\nof it over, than it is surrendered to the lawyers, who proceed to\r\nchaffer over it and cheapen their adversary’s claim, as they might do\r\nif they were purchasing a cow.” A self-styled Oriental student of the\r\nmodern Syrians, in a book bearing that title, graphically sketches\r\na representative bargaining scene in a café at Damascus, between a\r\nChristian indigo-dealer, in Beyrout costume, and a Jewish dyer; the\r\nformer pretending to feel insulted at being offered so low a price, and\r\nthe latter pretending to get into a passion at having his time taken\r\nup with a fruitless negotiation. Captain Marryat’s Travels in North\r\nAmerica supply a plurality of parallel passages; now of two misses\r\n“swopping” bonnets, with an assumed indifference and a suppressed ardour\r\nalmost ridiculous enough to verge on the sublime; and now of a couple\r\nof Down-Easters, whittling all the while they are bargaining, and doing\r\nboth with all their might and main. Fiction-writers who make a study\r\nof character and manners are fond of introducing scenes of this kind.\r\nScott’s Antiquary chuckles over his feats in cheapening old curiosities,\r\nand delights to tell how often he has stood haggling on a halfpenny,\r\nlest, by a too ready acquiescence in the dealer’s first price, he should\r\nbe led to suspect the value Mr. Oldbuck sets upon the article: “And then,\r\nMr. Lovel, the sly satisfaction with which one pays the consideration,\r\nand pockets the article, affecting a cold indifference, while the hand is\r\ntrembling with pleasure!” The bargaining match with Maggie, the Fairport\r\nfishwife, is one of the gems of the story. Mr. Charles Reade offers a\r\nracy pendant in his trafficking encounter between Christie Johnstone,\r\nthe pride of Newhaven, and the four Irish merchants who have agreed to\r\nwork together, and to make a show of competition, the better to keep\r\nthe price down within bounds, but who are no match for woman’s wit and\r\nwoman’s tongue, as exercised by Christie. The author of “Doctor Jacob”\r\ndepicts in Herr Schmidt a rosy, round man, with eyes that were never in\r\ntune with his mouth; the former being sharp, Jewish, and speculative;\r\nthe latter, supine, commercial, and conservative: “He made use of his\r\neyes when he bought, and of his mouth when he sold, giving his customers\r\nto understand that he was the easiest going man in the world, only\r\ndesirous of small profits, and by no means miserable if a gold watch or\r\nany other article went for half its value.” Canon Kingsley enlivens the\r\nadventures of “Hereward” with a certain Dick Hammerhand, the richest man\r\nin Walcheren, who tries to overreach the hero, and fails to his cost; one\r\nstage of the transaction taking this turn: “The less anxious the stranger\r\nseemed to buy, the more anxious grew Dick to sell; but he concealed his\r\nanxiety, and let the stranger turn away, thanking him for his drink,” but\r\nanon renewing the treaty with as much semblance of disregard as he could\r\nput on. The author of “The Gayworthys” works up a clever bit of homely\r\nchaffering between Mrs. Vorse and Widow Horke the strawberry-dealer.\r\nAnd we find ourselves between a couple of horse-dealers again in “Silas\r\nMarner:” “Bryce of course divined that Dunstan wanted to sell the horse,\r\nand Dunstan knew that he divined it (horse-dealing is only one of many\r\nhuman transactions carried on in this ingenious manner); and they both\r\nconsidered that the bargain was in its first stage, when Bryce replied\r\nironically, [to the other’s boast of a recent high bid,] ‘I wonder at\r\nthat now, I wonder you mean to keep him; for I never heard of a man who\r\ndidn’t want to sell his horse, getting a bid of half as much again as\r\nthe horse was worth,’” etc. Trust Bryce to boast of that horse, and of\r\nthat bargain, so soon as he is gone his way, the horse his, and the\r\nbargain made. It must be a distorted type of human nature that resembles\r\nthe discontented man of Theophrastus, who, after taking a great deal\r\nof pains to beat down the price of a slave, and after he has paid his\r\nmoney for him,—instead of boasting, breaks out into the grumble, “I am\r\nsure thou art good for nothing, or I should not have had thee so cheap.”\r\nA companion picture, in its way, but with the difference between an\r\ninveterate grumbler and an impenetrable oaf, is that by Plautus of a fool\r\nwith an old grange to sell, of which property he advertises the singular\r\nattractions to draw buyers to bid and buy. Nothing ever thrived on it, he\r\nsays; no owner of it ever died in his bed; the trees were all blasted;\r\nthe swine died of the measles, the cattle of the murrain, the sheep\r\nof the rot; nothing was ever reared there, not a duckling, or goose.\r\n_Hospitium fuit calamitatis._ It is naught, it is naught, saith the\r\nbuyer? No, the seller, in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_GRAY-HAIRED UNAWARES._\r\n\r\nHOSEA vii. 9.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the reminders and remonstrances which it was the mission of the\r\nprophet, the son of Beeri, in the days of Ahaz and Hezekiah, to deliver\r\nto Ephraim, there was this significant passage, expressive of a reckless\r\npeople’s unconscious decline, whose lapses were taken account of on high,\r\nand Ephraim knew it not—“Yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet\r\nhe knoweth not.”\r\n\r\nWho, asks Hartley Coleridge, ever saw their first gray hairs, or marked\r\nthe crow feet at the angle of their eyes, without a sigh or a tear, a\r\nmomentaneous self-abasement, a sudden sinking of the soul, a thought that\r\nyouth is fled for ever? “None but the blessed few that, having dedicated\r\ntheir spring of life to Heaven, behold in the shedding of their vernal\r\nblossoms a promise that the season of immortal fruit is near.” Gray\r\nhairs, in an advancing stage of the plural number, may be here and there\r\nupon us before we know of it. But the actual discovery of the first is a\r\nbit of an epoch in one’s life; and if one exclaims Eureka! it is hardly\r\nin the most jubilant of tones or the most exultant of tempers.\r\n\r\nFalstaff was surprised into a full purpose of amendment of life when he\r\nlighted on the first white hair on his chin; but only to keep on renewing\r\nthe purpose weekly, long after chin and head, too, must have been covered\r\nwith silver or snow.\r\n\r\nWith some the humour is to pass off the discovery in seeming glee; and\r\nperhaps it is the saturnine, melancholy temperament that is likeliest to\r\ndo this. For instance, Gerbier relates of Charles the First, that one\r\nmorning “as the King was combing his head, he found a white hair, which\r\nhe sent to the Queen in merriment. Henrietta Maria immediately wrote\r\nback that Don Carlos would cause many more to come up before the Emperor\r\ngave up the Palatinate.” Had the King not been himself combing his head\r\non this not too auspicious occasion, the probability is, as courts and\r\ncourtiers go, that his first white hair would not thus have been allowed\r\nto attract and invite attention. A courtly dresser would have been\r\nshocked to reveal what he saw, and would have kept the secret with _ex\r\nofficio_ conscientiousness. Many and many are the uncrowned heads upon\r\nwhich gray hairs are gathering here and there—a familiar sight enough to\r\noverseeing (and not overlooking) attendants or friends, but by the owners\r\nthemselves unsuspected as yet. Mrs. Browning lets Aurora Leigh espy one\r\nsuch straggler, which even the neat-handed maid-in-waiting overlooks, at\r\nLady Waldemar’s toilet:—\r\n\r\n    “Her maid must use both hands to twist that coil\r\n    Of tresses, then be careful lest the rich\r\n    Bronze rounds should slip:—she missed, though, a gray hair,\r\n    A single one,—I saw it; otherwise\r\n    The woman looked immortal.”\r\n\r\nIt is among the graver of his Recreations that a clerical essayist\r\npictures to himself man or woman, thoughtful, earnest, and pious,\r\nsitting down and musing, at the sight of the first gray hairs. Here is\r\nthe slight shadow, he puts it, of “a certain great event which is to\r\ncome;” the earliest touch of a chill hand which must prevail at length.\r\n“Here is manifest decay: we have begun to die. And no worthy human being\r\nwill pretend that this is other than a very solemn thought. And we look\r\nbackward as well as forward: how short a time since we were little\r\nchildren, and kind hands smoothed down the locks now grown scanty and\r\ngray.” So in Mrs. Southey’s (Caroline Bowles’) tender, simple verses on\r\nthe same trite theme:—\r\n\r\n    “Some there were took fond delight,\r\n    Sporting with these tresses bright,\r\n    To enring with living gold\r\n    Fingers now beneath the mould\r\n    (Woe is me!) grown icy cold.\r\n    ...\r\n    Now again a shining streak\r\n    ’Gins the dusky cloud to break;—\r\n    Here and there a glittering thread\r\n    Lights the ringlets, dark and dead—\r\n    Glittering light!—but pale and cold—\r\n    Glittering thread!—but _not_ of _gold_.\r\n\r\n    Silent warning! silvery streak!\r\n    Not unheeded dost thou speak.\r\n    Not with feelings light and vain,\r\n    Not with fond, regretful pain,\r\n    Look I on the token sent\r\n    To declare the day far spent.”\r\n\r\nMr. Thackeray makes his youngish widow, Amelia Osborne, take tranquilly\r\nenough this sort of revelation. “In these quiet labours and harmless\r\ncares the gentle widow’s life was passing away, a silver hair or two\r\nmarking the progress of time on her head, and a line deepening ever so\r\nlittle on her fair forehead. She used to smile at these marks of time.”\r\nWhich accords with her placid temperament. Quite otherwise constituted\r\nis Currer Bell’s Madame Beck. “A loud bell rang for morning school. She\r\ngot up. As she passed a dressing-table with a glass upon it, she looked\r\nat her reflected image. One single white hair streaked her nut-brown\r\ntresses; she plucked it out with a shudder.” That is an early phase of\r\nthe decadence of which Mr. Robert Browning graphically depicts a later\r\nstage:—\r\n\r\n    “One day, as the lady saw her youth\r\n    Depart, and the silver thread that streaked\r\n    Her hair, and, worn by the serpent’s tooth,\r\n    The brow so puckered, the chin so peaked—\r\n    She wondered who the woman was,\r\n    So hollow-eyed and haggard-cheeked.”\r\n\r\nMr. Trollope’s Captain Cutwater is the representative of a large\r\nconstituency in at least this one salient particular, that he “had no\r\nidea that he was an old man. He had lived for so many years among men\r\nof his own stamp, who had grown gray and bald and rickety and weak\r\nalongside of him,” that when he moved into a younger circle, and settled\r\nthere, he ignored the disparity of ages. In Juvenal’s emphatic phrase,\r\nold age steals upon us unawares,—unperceived, unrecognised: _obrepit non\r\nintellecta senectus_. This stealthy in-coming, or on-coming, of old age\r\nis an iterated topic in the classics. Cicero, indeed, had been beforehand\r\nwith Juvenal, almost word for word: _non intelligitur quando obrepit\r\nsenectus_. There is Ovid, again, with his “stealthy lapse” of age,\r\nbeguiling as it wears away: _labitur occulte, fallitque volubilis ætas_;\r\nand with his elsewhere reminder, that time glides on, and with noiseless\r\nyears we grow older till we grow old: _Tempora labuntur, tacitisque\r\nsenescimus annis_. Without, as Hazlitt says, our in the least suspecting\r\nit, the mists are at our feet, and the shadows of age encompass us.\r\nLeigh Hunt somewhere comments feelingly on the difficulty of learning\r\nhow narrow and dim a boundary separates mature from old age; and quoting\r\nhis own personal experience, says, that a single illness made the line\r\nof demarcation clear to him. So M. de Ste.-Beuve: _Rien n’est pénible à\r\ndémêler comme les confins des ages: il faut souvent que quelque chose\r\nvienne du dehors et coupe court_.\r\n\r\nThere is all the more force in the kindly wish of Mr. Tennyson’s Will\r\nWaterproof, that the plump object of it may live long, ere from his\r\ntopmost head the thickset hazel dies; long, ere the hateful crow shall\r\ntread the corners of his eyes; all the more force as coming from one who\r\nhas to own of himself—\r\n\r\n    “For I had hope, by something rare,\r\n      To prove myself a poet;\r\n    But, while I plan, and plan, my hair\r\n      Is gray before I know it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_RESTRAINED ANGER._\r\n\r\nPROVERBS xvi. 32.\r\n\r\n\r\n“He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth\r\nhis spirit than he that taketh a city.” To be ruled by one’s angry spirit\r\nis cruel bondage indeed, for that taskmaster never spares the lash. To\r\nrule or to be ruled,—that is the question.\r\n\r\n    “Ira furor brevis est: animum rege; qui, nisi paret,\r\n    Imperat: hunc frenis, hunc tu compesce catenâ.”\r\n\r\nMarcus Antoninus, in his Meditations, calls rage and resentment marks of\r\nan unmanly disposition; mildness and temper being not only more humane,\r\nbut, he contends, more masculine too. And the philosophic emperor wrote\r\nand spoke as one of, what Mr. Matthew Arnold calls, those\r\n\r\n    “... milder natures, and more free,\r\n    Whom an unblamed serenity\r\n    Hath freed from passions, and the state\r\n    Of struggle these necessitate.”\r\n\r\nFrom that state of struggle many a victor emerges with honourable scars,\r\nbut deep. Famous and significant is the story of the physiognomist who\r\ndetected in the features of Socrates the traces of that fiery temper\r\nwhich for the most part he kept in severe control, but which, when it\r\ndid break loose, is described by those who witnessed it as absolutely\r\nterrible, overleaping both in act and language every barrier of the\r\nordinary decorum of Grecian manners. Le Clerc’s _éloge_ of John Locke\r\nincludes the remark that if he had any defect, it was the being somewhat\r\npassionate; “but he had got the better of it by reason, and it was very\r\nseldom that it did him or any one else any harm.” Of Rudolf of Hapsburg\r\nwe are told that he was by nature warm and choleric, but that as he\r\nadvanced in years he corrected this defect. To some of his friends,\r\nexpressing their wonder that since his elevation to the imperial dignity\r\nhe had restrained the vehemence of his temper, the founder of the House\r\nof Austria replied, “I have often repented of being passionate, never\r\nof being mild and humane.” One of Cromwell’s biographers reports his\r\n“temper exceeding fiery; but the flame of it kept down for the most\r\npart, or soon allayed with those moral endowments he had.” The admirable\r\nFrederick Borromeo was admired for a placability, a sweetness of manner\r\nnearly imperturbable, which, however, as Manzoni reminds us, was not\r\nnatural to the devout prelate, but was the effect of continual combat\r\nagainst a quick and hasty disposition. Lord Clarendon more than once in\r\nhis autobiography, plumes himself on having mastered and “suppressed\r\nthat heat and passion he was naturally inclined to be transported with.”\r\n“They who knew the great infirmity of his whole family, which abounded\r\nin passion, used to say he had much extinguished the unruliness of that\r\nfire.” Lord Macaulay turns to the advantage of his favourite chancellor\r\nthe assertion of his detractors, that the disposition of the great\r\nSomers was very far from being so gentle as the world believed, that he\r\nwas really prone to the angry passions, and that sometimes, while his\r\nvoice was soft, and his words kind and courteous, his delicate frame was\r\nalmost convulsed by suppressed emotion. His brilliant advocate is fain to\r\naccept this reproach as the highest of all eulogies. Again: Sir Archibald\r\nAlison assures us of Sir Robert Peel, that he was by nature afflicted\r\nwith a most violent temper, and that so extreme were his paroxysms of\r\nanger, when a young man, that he used, while they were coming on, to shut\r\nhimself up alone till the dark fit was over. “By degrees, however, he\r\nobtained the mastery of this infirmity, and this at length so effectually\r\nthat he passed with the world, at a distance, as a man of a singularly\r\ncold and phlegmatic temperament.” Lady Holland reports her distinguished\r\nfather to have been naturally choleric,—prefacing the statement by a\r\nreflection, that, although it is not the part of a daughter to reveal\r\nfaults, yet a fault nobly repaired, or repented of, adds to the respect\r\nand interest which a character inspires. By her showing, then, Mr. Sydney\r\nSmith was by nature quick and hasty, but always struggled against the\r\nfailing, and made many regulations to avoid exciting any such emotions;\r\nand when he did give way, it often excited his biographer’s admiration\r\nto see him gradually subduing his chafed spirit, and to observe his\r\ndissatisfaction with himself till he had humbled himself and made his\r\npeace, it mattered not with whom, groom or child. “He could not bear the\r\nreproaches of his own heart.” So Mr. Henry Rogers observes of Locke,\r\nand his success, by dint of “immense pains” taken, in subjugating his\r\ncholeric propensity, that his anxiety for its complete subjugation\r\nappears in his never being so angry with another as he always was with\r\nhimself—for being angry. Those who are conversant with the journal and\r\nletters of Dr. Chalmers, may remember how often that good man takes\r\nhimself to task for infirmities of temper, and how strenuously he\r\nresolves to strive to keep down every tendency to irritation when in\r\ncompany, to “try to maintain a vigorous contest with this unfortunate\r\npeculiarity of my temper,” to “school down every irritable feeling;” and\r\nhow remorsefully he records such instances as getting “into a violent\r\npassion with Sandy,” and getting “ruffled with Jane,” in a manner and to\r\na degree “quite unchristian.” Passages abound such as, “Now is the time\r\nfor reflecting on the evils of intemperate passion;” “erred egregiously\r\nthis evening in venting my indignation;” “I may at least ward off the\r\nassaults of anger;” “erred in betraying my anger to my servant and wife;”\r\n“constant visitations of indignancy; this exceedingly wrong: there is not\r\na greater foe to spirituality than wrath.” “O my God, deliver me from\r\nall rancour and much irritableness,”[41] etc., etc. “Here,” to apply the\r\nlines of Wordsworth’s son-in-law,—\r\n\r\n    “Here was a temper less by nature tuned\r\n    Than harmonized by discipline to rule,\r\n    And by religion sanctified to peace.”\r\n\r\nThe pen is too truly said to be a fruitful source of regrets to some of\r\nus, in regard of the outbreaks of temper we allow it to put on paper; and\r\nnever is the sting sharper, says one essayist, than when we realize that\r\nour imprudence is in black and white, beyond our reach, irrevocable. “We\r\nsend off our letter, to repent sometimes how bitterly!” _Litera scripta\r\nmanet._ Hence the advice of another, never to write in anger, or, at\r\nany rate, to keep your letter till you are cool. We are recommended,\r\nwhen indignant at any one’s conduct, to write a letter couched in the\r\nstrongest terms possible, as satirical and cutting as we can make it,\r\nand having done this, to direct, seal, and put it in our desk for a few\r\nhours, then read it for our own satisfaction, and tear it up. Another\r\npopular authority, earnestly deprecating angry letters, lays down as a\r\nrule to be observed throughout the letter-writing world, that no angry\r\nletter be posted till four and twenty hours shall have elapsed since it\r\nwas written. “We all know how absurd is that other rule, of saying the\r\nalphabet when you are angry. Trash! Sit down and write your letter; write\r\nit with all the venom in your power; spit out your spleen at the fullest;\r\nit will do you good: you think you have been injured; say all that you\r\ncan say with all your poisoned eloquence, and gratify yourself by reading\r\nit while your temper is still hot. Then put it in your desk, and, as a\r\nmatter of course, burn it before breakfast the following morning. Believe\r\nme that you will then have a double gratification.” _Loquitur_ the\r\nperhaps most widely read, and without a perhaps the most prolific, writer\r\nof the day.\r\n\r\nWhen Cœur-de-Lion, in Scott’s “Talisman,” incensed and mortified at the\r\nTemplar’s tactics, yet foresaw the penalty of giving way to his headlong\r\nresentment, with a strong effort he remained silent till he had repeated\r\na pater noster, that being the course which “his confessor had enjoined\r\nhim to pursue when anger was likely to obtain dominion over him.” The\r\nfamiliar “count five-and-twenty, Tattycoram,” in one of Mr. Dickens’\r\nlater stories is but another practical application of the selfsame text.\r\n\r\nGibbon adds to his account of the public penance inflicted by Ambrose on\r\nTheodosius, for the massacre of Thessalonica, this remark: “and the edict\r\nwhich interposes a salutary interval of thirty days between the sentence\r\nand the execution, may be accepted as the worthy fruits of his [the\r\nemperor’s] repentance.” For it was by a hasty resolve that Theodosius\r\nswore in his wrath to expiate the blood of his lieutenant, Botheric,\r\nby the blood of a guilty people; his fiery and choleric temper being\r\nimpatient of the dilatory forms of a judicial inquiry. In hot haste he\r\ndespatched the messengers of death; but attempted, when it was too late,\r\nto prevent the execution of his own orders. Avenging furiously in haste,\r\nhe had to repent at leisure; and he did repent.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, perhaps, observed Dean Swift, for the best and wisest\r\namong us to keep so constant a guard upon our temper but that we may\r\nat some time or other lie open to the strokes of fortune. Incensed on\r\none occasion, “it was natural for me to have immediate recourse to my\r\npen and ink; but before I would offer to make use of them, I resolved\r\ndeliberately to tell over a hundred; and when I came to the end of\r\nthat sum, I found it more advisable to defer drawing up my intended\r\nremonstrance till I had slept soundly on my resentments.” We are told\r\nof the celebrated Macklin, that although so particular in drilling the\r\nperformers at rehearsals, he was scrupulous in keeping his temper down,\r\nthe irritability of which he knew too well; and that on one occasion he\r\ninterposed an hour by his stop-watch, all retiring together from the\r\nstage to the green-room, at the end of which time all were in good humour\r\nagain, and the rehearsal was resumed. “When the evil effects of hasty\r\nanger approach, the consequences of which may be irretrievable,”—thus\r\nmoralizes a fellow-craftsman, John O’Keeffe,—“it would be no harm if all\r\nof us could suppress our own feelings, even for Macklin’s green-room\r\nhour.” His mighty master, Shakspeare, would have supplied him with a\r\nprecedent, in the case of good Duke Humphrey, who says as he re-enters,—\r\n\r\n    “Now, lords, my choler being overblown\r\n    With walking once about the quadrangle,\r\n    I come to talk of commonwealth affairs.”\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Fowell Buxton’s secretary, Mr. Nixon, on his own showing,\r\ncould not refrain from blurting out just what he felt at the moment,\r\nwhen differences arose between the two. This used to vex Sir Thomas,\r\nwho however would say nothing till the next day, and then, when the\r\nsecretary thought that the whole matter had passed off (having perhaps\r\nreceived great kindness in the meantime), the remonstrance would come\r\nout, “What a silly fellow you were, Nixon, to put yourself in such a\r\npassion yesterday! If I had spoken then, we should most probably have\r\nparted. Make it a rule never to speak when you are in a passion, but wait\r\ntill the next day.” And we are assured that, if at any time he happened\r\nto transgress this rule himself, he was seriously vexed and grieved,\r\nand could not rest till he had in some way made amends for his want of\r\nself-restraint.\r\n\r\nMolière’s Arnolphe propounds the prophylactic rule with emphasis and\r\ndiscretion:\r\n\r\n    “Un certain Grec disait à l’empereur Auguste,\r\n    Comme une instruction utile autant que juste,\r\n    Que lorsqu’une aventure en colére nous met,\r\n    Nous devons, avant tout, dire nôtre alphabet,\r\n    Afin que dans ce temps la bile se tempère,\r\n    Et qu’on ne fasse rien que l’on ne doive faire.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_EVANESCENCE OF THE EARLY DEW._\r\n\r\nHOSEA vi. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the word of the prophet Hosea, the Divine reproach fell on Ephraim and\r\non Judah, that their goodness was as a morning cloud, and that as the\r\nearly dew it passed away. Bright was the promise of innocent dawn, but\r\nthe promise was unfulfilled. A stern moral application lies in the words\r\nof Dante:\r\n\r\n                    “... The will in man\r\n    Bears goodly blossoms; but its ruddy promise\r\n    Is, by the dripping of perpetual rain,\r\n    Made mere abortion: faith and innocence\r\n    Are met with but in babes; each taking leave\r\n    Ere cheeks with down are sprinkled.”\r\n\r\nAdam Smith observes, in his “Theory of Moral Sentiment,” that, in the eye\r\nof nature, it would seem, a child is a more important object than an old\r\nman, and excites a much more lively, as well as a much more universal\r\nsympathy. “It ought to do so,” he adds. “Everything may be expected, or\r\nat least hoped, from the child. In ordinary cases, very little can be\r\neither expected or hoped from the old man.” It is regretful, remorseful\r\neld that is supposed to utter the lament, in gazing on childish faces and\r\nforms, heaven-encompassed infancy,—\r\n\r\n    “O little souls! as pure and white\r\n    And crystalline as rays of light\r\n      Direct from heaven, their source divine;\r\n    Refracted through the mist of years,\r\n    How red my setting sun appears,\r\n      How lurid looks this soul of mine!”\r\n\r\nMrs. Trench writes to the poet of the “Pleasures of Memory,” and with\r\ndirect reference to that poem, “In looking back, the only days I\r\nearnestly desire to recall, are those which glided away while I was\r\n‘girt with growing infancy,’ and read in the eyes and the smiles of my\r\nchildren, who were affectionate and beautiful, a promise of happiness,\r\nsuch as this world can never fulfil.” A more vigorous poet than Samuel\r\nRogers, has a vigorous but gloomy stanza on the kindling emotions of\r\nyoung motherhood, when the wife—\r\n\r\n    “Blest into mother, in the innocent look,\r\n    Or even the piping cry of lips that brook\r\n    No pain and small suspense, a joy perceives\r\n    Man knows not, when from out its cradled nook\r\n    She sees her little bud put forth its leaves—\r\n    What may the fruits be yet?—I know not—Cain was Eve’s.”\r\n\r\nThe fallen young mother in Mrs. Gaskell’s story hails in her child a new,\r\npure, beautiful, innocent life, which she fondly imagines, in the early\r\npassion of maternal love, she can guard from every touch of corrupting\r\nsin by ever watchful and most tender care. “And _her_ mother had thought\r\nthe same, most probably; and thousands of others think the same, and pray\r\nto God to purify and cleanse their souls, that they may be fit guardians\r\nfor their little children.”\r\n\r\nJuvenal asks, “what morn’s so holy but its sun betrays theft, perfidy,\r\nand fraud.” The thief, the betrayer, the cheat, was once a child. Ovid\r\nurges the dissimilitude between such a man and such a child: _dissimiles\r\nhic vir, et ille puer_. The Abbé Delille expatiates on the attractions of\r\neach Spring-tide, and, by affinity, of each new-born Day, as consisting\r\nin its refreshing redolence of promise—“_qui ne nous fait que des\r\npromesses_.” Fraught with feeling in every line is the following sonnet\r\naddressed by the late Baron Alderson to one of his children on her second\r\nbirthday:\r\n\r\n    “Sweet is the fragrance of the morning hour,\r\n      Sweet is the sun’s first radiance, sweet the year,\r\n    In the spring’s early promise, sweet the flower,\r\n      Seen in its buds, ere yet its leaves appear—\r\n    But sweeter far, my angel babe, to me\r\n      Is that blue eye that speaks thy opening mind,\r\n      That beams with new quick thoughts, yet undefined,\r\n    That tell of what is now and what may be.\r\n    O may the God who taught us that, like thee,\r\n      We should be pure and spotless, bless thee still;\r\n    Lay on thy infant head His hand, to free\r\n      Thine heart from sin, and form thee to His will,\r\n    Cleanse thee from aught that’s evil or defiled,\r\n    And keep thee as thou art, my darling child.”\r\n\r\nGeorge Eliot somewhere speaks of a promise void, like so many other\r\nsweet, illusory promises of our childhood; void as promises made in\r\nEden before the seasons were divided, and when the starry blossoms grew\r\nside by side with the ripening peach—impossible to be fulfilled when\r\nthe golden gates had been passed. Mr. Dickens says of the faint image\r\nof Eden which is stamped upon our hearts in childhood, that it “chafes\r\nand rubs in our rough struggles with the world, and soon wears away; too\r\noften to leave nothing but a mournful blank remaining.” Elia, the essay\r\nwriter, is no way backward to own the demerits and even delinquencies\r\nof himself as Elia, the middle aged man; but for the child Elia, that\r\n“other me,” there, in the background,—he must take leave to cherish the\r\nremembrance of that young master—with as little reference, he protests,\r\nto this stupid changeling of five-and-forty, as if it had been a child\r\nof some other house, and not _his_ father’s son. “I know how it shrank\r\nfrom any the least colour of falsehood. God help thee, Elia, how art thou\r\nchanged! Thou art sophisticated. I know how honest, how courageous (for a\r\nweakling) it was—how religious, how imaginative, how hopeful. From what\r\nhave I not fallen, if the child I remember was indeed myself!”\r\n\r\nStupid changelings of forty-five, their name is Legion, for they are\r\nindeed many. Glance with Shenstone at the shiny row of plump promissory\r\nfaces in the dame school:—\r\n\r\n    “Even now sagacious foresight points to show\r\n    A little bench of heedless bishops here,\r\n    And there a chancellor in embryo,\r\n    Or bard sublime, if bard may e’er be so,\r\n    As Milton, Shakspeare, names that ne’er shall die!”\r\n\r\nSo, to apply the words of Hazlitt, if we look back to past generations\r\n(as far as eye can reach), we see the same fears, hopes, wishes, followed\r\nby the same disappointments, throbbing in the human heart; and so we may\r\never see them (if we look forward) rising up for ever, and disappearing\r\nlike vapourish bubbles. Capable of application even are Joanna Baillie’s\r\nlines assimilating the stupid changelings aforesaid to a dull cat in\r\ncontrast with its sprightly, mercurial kittenhood:—\r\n\r\n    “Ah! many a lightly sportive child,\r\n    Who hath like thee our wits beguiled,\r\n    To dull and sober manhood grown,\r\n    With strange recoil our hearts disown.”\r\n\r\n_Il y a en chacun de nous_, writes Sainte-Beuve, _un être primitif,\r\nidéal, que la nature a dessiné de sa main la plus maternelle, mais\r\nque l’homme trop souvent étoffe ou corrompt_. Mr. Kingsley, in a\r\ntouching reflection—literally reflection, looking back—on the “long\r\nlost might-have been,” adverts to that personal idea which every soul\r\nbrings with it into the world, which shines dim and potential in the\r\nface of every sleeping babe, before it has been scarred, and distorted,\r\nand encrusted in the long tragedy of life. Dr. Caird has said of the\r\nbirthday of the worst of men, that although it ushered a new agent of\r\nevil into existence, and was a day fraught with more disastrous results\r\nto the world than the day in which the pestilence began to creep over\r\nthe nations, or the blight to fasten on the food of man, or any other\r\nphysical evil to enter on a career of world-wide devastation,—yet might\r\nthis day, when the vilest of humanity first saw the light, be in some\r\naspects of it regarded as better (despite Solomon’s text) than the day\r\nof his death. “For, to take only one view of it, when life commenced,\r\nthe problem of good or evil, to which death has brought so terrible a\r\nsolution, was, in his case, as yet unsolved. The page of human history\r\nwhich he was to write was yet unwritten, and to that day belonged,\r\nat all events, the advantage of the uncertainty whether it was to be\r\nblurred and blotted, or written fair and clean.” Life, even in the most\r\nunfavourable circumstances, it is urged, has ever some faint gleams of\r\nhope to brighten its outset. The preacher owns that the simplicity, the\r\ntenderness, the unconscious refinement that more or less characterize\r\ninfancy, even among the lowest and rudest, soon indeed pass away,\r\nand give place to the coarseness of an unideal, if not the animal\r\nrepulsiveness of a sensual or sinful life. But he insists that at least\r\nat the beginning, for a little while, there is something in the seeming\r\ninnocency, the brightness, the unworldliness, the unworn freshness of\r\nchildhood, that gives hope room to work. Is there not, he asks, for every\r\nchild, not in the dreams of parental fondness only, but in reality,\r\nand in God’s idea, the possibility of a noble future? “The history of\r\neach new-born soul is surely in God’s plan and intention a bright and\r\nblessed one. For the vilest miscreant that was ever hounded out of life\r\nin dishonour and wretchedness, there was, in the mind of the All-Good, a\r\nDivine ideal, a glorious possibility of excellence, which might have been\r\nmade a reality.” The most hardened ruffian, the most obdurate criminal,\r\nthe most impenetrable reprobate, was once a child.\r\n\r\nIf it be a philosophical truth that the child is father of the man—all\r\nthat is now broadly emblazoned in the man having been once latent—seen\r\nor not seen—as a vernal bud in the child; it is not therefore true\r\nuniversally, as Mr. de Quincey points out, that all which pre-exists in\r\nthe child finds its development in the man. “Rudiments and tendencies,\r\nwhich _might_ have found, sometimes by accident, _do_ not find, sometimes\r\nunder the killing frost of counter forces, _cannot_ find, their natural\r\nevolution.” Most of what he has, the grown-up man is shown to inherit\r\nfrom his infant self; but it does not follow that he always enters upon\r\nthe whole of his natural inheritance. Childhood has been passionately\r\napostrophized as\r\n\r\n        “... thou vindication\r\n    Of God—thou living witness against all men\r\n    Who have been babes—thou everlasting promise\r\n    Which no man keeps!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_EARS TO HEAR._\r\n\r\nST. LUKE viii. 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n“He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.” These words cried Jesus,\r\nat the close of His parable of the Sower. And He went on to say that\r\nto some, to the many, He spake in parables, that seeing they might\r\nnot see—not having eyes to see; and that hearing they might not\r\nunderstand—not having ears to hear in the Gospel sense. Nor in the\r\nOld Testament sense; for these very words are cited from Isaiah; in\r\nDeuteronomy too we read of those to whom the Lord hath not given ears to\r\nhear; and in both Jeremiah and Ezekiel, of those who have ears to hear,\r\nand hear not. One apostle laments the destiny of those to whom God hath\r\ngiven the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that\r\nthey should not hear. And to another was entrusted the appeal, “He that\r\nhath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.” For\r\nonly the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge. The unwise is like the deaf\r\nadder that stoppeth her ear. The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the\r\nLord hath made even both of them.\r\n\r\nGive but interest in the theme, and the listener’s ear fulfils its\r\nnatural function, that of hearing. “Mine ears hast Thou opened.”\r\nIntensify the interest, and the listener is all ears, all ear. Milton\r\npictures a time—\r\n\r\n              “when, Adam first of men,\r\n    To first of women, Eve thus moving speech,\r\n    Turn’d him, all ear.”\r\n\r\nSo again the attendant spirit in his “Comus”:—\r\n\r\n                        “... I was all ear,\r\n    And took in strains that might create a soul\r\n    Under the ribs of Death.”\r\n\r\nWebster’s ill-starred Duchess of Malfi assures her brother, “I will plant\r\nmy soul in my ears to hear you.” _Je t’écoute sans cligner la paupière_,\r\nexclaims Marillac, in “Gerfaut,” _dût ta narration durer sept jours et\r\nsept nuits_. “Alarmed nature starts up in my heart, and opens a thousand\r\nears to listen,” cries Colonel Talbot in an old play. Perplexed in the\r\nextreme, and cut to the heart, by a revelation of household treachery and\r\nwrong, an incredulous husband is described in a modern romance, with his\r\nhands clasped together, and with his head bent to catch every syllable\r\nof the harrowing news,—listening “as if his whole being were resolved\r\ninto that one sense of hearing.” That reads like a literal translation of\r\nBalzac’s description of one whose whole _vie se concentra dans le seul\r\nsens de l’ouïe_. On another page he is not forgetful of _certains hommes_\r\nwho _se bouchent les oreilles pour ne plus rien entendre_. None so deaf\r\nas those who will not hear. Next to them may rank those who do not care\r\nto. The familiar narrative of “Eyes and No Eyes” might easily have its\r\npendent and parallel, point by point, and paragraph by paragraph, in one\r\nto be called _Ears and No Ears_.\r\n\r\nIt is with hearing as with seeing. The eye is not satisfied with seeing,\r\nnor the ear filled with hearing. Mendelssohn, in one of his letters from\r\nabroad, rapturous with gazing on his “favourite Titian,” declares that\r\none “might well wish for a dozen more eyes to look one’s fill at such\r\na picture.” “Had I three ears I’d hear thee!” exclaims Macbeth, when\r\nsummoned to attend by the apparition of an Armed Head, in the witches’\r\ncave. Just as one of Plato’s epigrams expresses a wish for the thousand\r\neyes of the starry sky, that he might gaze his fill on the star of his\r\nlife:\r\n\r\n                          εἴθε γενοίμην\r\n    Οὐρανὸς, ὡς πολλοῖς ὄμμασιν ἐίς δὲ βλέπω.\r\n\r\nHorace uses the expressive phrase, _bibit aure_, in one of his\r\nodes—literally, “drink in with the ear”—a phrase admired by the\r\ncommentators for its lyric boldness. “I was all fixed to listen,” says\r\nDante, in the tenth gulf of _l’Inferno_. “O speak your counsel now,\r\nfor Saturn’s ear is all a-hungered,” entreats the Titan, in Keats’s\r\n_Hyperion_. D’Artagnan, in the ante-chamber of M. de Treville, is\r\ndescribed as looking with all his eyes and listening with all his ears,\r\nstretching his five senses so as to lose nothing. The same author tells\r\nhow Mazarin listened, dying as he was, to Anne of Austria, as ten living\r\nmen could not have listened. “Will you listen?” asks a prince in the same\r\nstory; and is answered, “Can you ask me? You speak of a matter of life or\r\ndeath to me, and then ask if I will listen.”\r\n\r\nWhen Falstaff asks the prince, “Dost thou hear me, Hal?” “Ay, and mark\r\nthee too,” is the reply; and that there is a difference between hearing\r\nand marking, between lending one ear and giving both, Falstaff knew as\r\nwell as most men. And could practise what he knew, if occasion prompted.\r\nWitness his wilful deafness when taken to task by the Lord Chief\r\nJustice. “Boy, tell him I’m deaf,” he bids his page say. So, “You must\r\nspeak louder, my master’s deaf,” says the boy. “I am sure he is, to the\r\nhearing of anything good,” rejoins the Chief Justice. And when, anon,\r\nhis lordship taxes the incorrigible knight with being deaf to what he\r\nis saying, Sir John assures him, with that consummate assurance of his,\r\nthat he hears him very well: “Rather, an’t please you, it is the disease\r\nof not listening, the malady of not marking, that I am troubled withal.”\r\nQuite capable is that witty profligate of entering into the import of\r\neach phrase in the collect on the Holy Scriptures, which prays that we\r\nmay in such wise hear them, as to mark and learn, and inwardly digest\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nA late divine, treating of “animal men” in the “animal” sense of St.\r\nPaul, as those who cannot discern spiritual things, but are absorbed in\r\nanimalism as their being’s end and aim, affirmed that unavailing as it\r\nseems to be to talk to them of religion, it avails no more talking of\r\npoetry, and art, or speculative science, or the nobler things of the\r\nsoul: “How can such men discern the things of the Spirit? They understand\r\nTennyson as little as they understand St. Paul.” Having ears they hear\r\nnot anything so far away as the music of the spheres. Of _that_, and such\r\nas that, the animal man might say, by self-application of a couplet of\r\nCowper’s,\r\n\r\n    “For which, alas! my destiny severe,\r\n    Though ears she gave me two, gave me no ear.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_NOT ALONE IN THE VALLEY OF SHADOWS._\r\n\r\nPSALM xxiii. 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo good thing will He, from whom cometh every good gift, withhold from\r\nthem that love Him, and that walk uprightly; least of all then His\r\npresence when most that presence is indispensable,—as a _very_ present\r\nhelp in trouble. And when so indispensable as in the valley of the\r\nshadow of death—darkening more and more unto the perfect night? We must\r\ndie alone. It is a truism, in its natural sense. But in what the devout\r\nmind refuses to call or consider a non-natural sense, the righteous hath\r\ncompanionship as well as hope in his death. He who can say, The Lord is\r\nmy shepherd, I shall not want, confines not his reliance to the range\r\nof green pastures and still waters, but extends it to the glooms of the\r\ngrave and the swellings of Jordan. Not alone at the last, for the Good\r\nShepherd knoweth His sheep, and is known of them. And how known? For one\r\nthat will not let them want. “Yea, though I walk through the valley of\r\nthe shadow of death I will fear no evil; for Thou art with me; Thy rod\r\nand Thy staff they comfort me.”\r\n\r\nPascal said that the solitude of death was the bitterest pang of\r\nhumanity; and because one must die alone, the end of life is its heaviest\r\ntrial. Some Frenchmen and Frenchwomen, very French, have essayed, in\r\ntheir peculiar fashion, to elude the disaster, simply by dying in public.\r\nPeople in Paris died in public in the seventeenth century. Death, as\r\nMr. Herman Merivale puts it, was but the last scene of the play, to\r\nbe performed with a theatrical bow and exit. He shows us the young\r\nbeauty, perishing of dissipation, who made her adieux to the world in\r\nappropriate costume and sentiments; and the worn-out statesman, who\r\nmight not turn his face to the wall in peace, but was surrounded by a\r\nwhole court in full dress, and talked on till his husky accents could\r\nno longer convey the last of his smart sayings to the listeners.[42]\r\nWith all his fribbles and frivolities Horace Walpole was not quite\r\nFrenchified enough to willingly face death in a French hotel, with all\r\nits noise and excitement, “and, what would be still worse, exposed to\r\nreceive all visits; for the French, you know,” he writes to Conway, “are\r\nnever more in public than in the act of death. I am like animals, and\r\nlove to hide myself when I am dying”—which refers to his periodical, and\r\nprolonged, and always perilous attacks of gout. “If,” says the author of\r\n“Life in the Sick-room,” “I could not trust my friends to save me from\r\ninvoluntary encroachment at the last, I had rather scoop myself a hole\r\nin the sand of the desert, and die alone, than be tended by the gentlest\r\nhands, and soothed by the most loving voices in the choicest chamber.”\r\nWordsworth’s Marmaduke exclaims,—\r\n\r\n    “Give me a reason why the wisest thing\r\n    That the earth knows shall never choose to die,\r\n    But some one must be near to count his groans.\r\n    The wounded deer retires to solitude,\r\n    And dies in solitude: all things but man,\r\n    All die in solitude.”\r\n\r\nSpecial note has been taken of the exceptional characteristic in the\r\naltogether exceptional career of the prophet Elijah, that, in his last\r\nhour, when he was on his way to a strange and unprecedented departure\r\nfrom this world—when the whirlwind and flame chariot were ready, he\r\nasked for no human companionship. “The bravest men are pardoned if one\r\nlingering feeling of human weakness clings to them at the last, and\r\nthey desire a human eye resting on them—a human hand in theirs—a human\r\npresence. But Elijah would have rejected all. In harmony with the rest\r\nof his lonely severe character, he desired to meet his Creator alone.”\r\nOne hears of such preferences now and then, in oddly constituted natures.\r\nSir Walter Scott, in a letter to his sister-in-law, appears to indicate\r\na disposition of this kind as prevalent in his father’s family. “Poor\r\naunt Curle,” he tells her, “died like a Roman, or rather like one of the\r\nSandy-Knowe bairns, the most stoical race I ever knew. She turned every\r\none out of the room, and drew her last breath alone. So did my uncle,\r\nCaptain Robert Scott, and several others of that family.” Affectation\r\nwas so inherent in Chateaubriand’s confessions and professions, that\r\none knows not how far genuine may have been his plea for what he calls\r\nthe “necessity of isolation,” and its advantages in death as in life.\r\n“Any hand is good enough to reach us the glass of water that we call for\r\nin the fever of death. Ah! may that hand not be too dear to us!” The\r\n“necessity of isolation” reminds us of Keble’s query:—\r\n\r\n    “Why should we faint and fear to live alone,\r\n      Since all alone, so Heaven has will’d, we die,\r\n    Nor even the tenderest heart, and next our own,\r\n      Knows half the reasons why we smile and sigh?”\r\n\r\nAnd that again reminds us, with a difference—the difference between\r\nMadame de Staël and the sweet singer of the “Christian Year,”—of Corinne\r\non her death-bed, saying to Castel Forte: “But for you, I should die\r\nalone. There is no help for such a moment; friends can but follow us to\r\nthe brink; there begin thoughts too deep, too troublous, to be confided.”\r\n_Mon sort est de mourir seul_, writes Rousseau’s bereaved Solitaire;\r\n_et la seule Providence me fermera les yeux_. Scott was not of mere\r\nimagination all compact when he made Edie Ochiltree say, in the cave that\r\nforms the old mendicant’s favourite retreat, “I hae had mony a thought,\r\nthat when I found myself auld and forfairn, and no able to enjoy God’s\r\nblessed air ony langer, I wad e’en streek mysell out here, and abide my\r\nremoval, like an auld dog that trails its useless ugsome carcass into\r\nsome bush or bracken.” Montaigne says that, might he have his choice,\r\nhe thought he should like best to die out of his own house, and away\r\nfrom his own people. The Emperor Marcus Aurelius, on the seventh day\r\nof his last illness, admitted none but his unworthy son (Commodus) to\r\nhis chamber, and after a few words dismissed him, “covered his head for\r\nsleep, and”—in Dean Merivale’s words—“passed away alone and untended.”\r\nEpigrammatic historians love to tell of Catherine the Great, who had\r\nreigned over five hundred and forty towns, over forty-two governments,\r\nover a multitude of isles of the sea from Kamschatka to Japan, and over\r\neighty millions of slaves, that she died alone, entirely alone, without\r\na single slave at hand to support her drooping head. The picture is\r\nmeant to be sensational, and as written in French and for the French,\r\nit may be telling enough. It tells, for instance, upon such a nature as\r\nMadame Sophie Gay, who used to promise her friends to come and die among\r\nthem, when it was her turn and her time; adding, in her very French\r\nstyle, “Je ne veux pas que cette demoiselle”—meaning _la mort_—“me\r\ntrouve seule.” Upon others, the grand climax of supreme solitude fails\r\nof effect. “It has always been my wish,” writes Southey, for example,\r\n“to die far from my friends, to crawl like a dog into some corner and\r\nexpire unseen. I would neither give nor receive unavailing pain.” When\r\ndeath overtook St. Francis Xavier, he was on board of a vessel bound\r\nfor Siam, and at his own request he was removed to the shore, that he\r\nmight die with the greater composure. Stretched on the naked beach,\r\nwith the cold blasts of a Chinese winter aggravating his pains—thus Sir\r\nJames Stephen describes his last moments—he contended alone with the\r\nagonies of the fever which wasted his vital power. “It was an agony and\r\na solitude for which the happiest of the sons of men might well have\r\nexchanged the dearest society, and the purest of the joys of life.... It\r\nwas a solitude thronged by blessed ministers of peace and consolation,\r\nvisible in all their bright and lovely aspects to the now unclouded eye\r\nof faith; and audible to the dying martyr through the yielding bars of\r\nhis mortal prison-house, in strains of exulting joy till then unheard and\r\nunimagined.”\r\n\r\n    “Thou must go forth alone, my soul, thou must go forth alone,—\r\n    To other scenes, to other worlds, that mortal hath not known,\r\n    Thou must go forth alone, my soul, to tread the narrow vale;\r\n    But He, whose word is sure, hath said His comforts shall not fail.\r\n    His rod and staff shall comfort thee across the dreary road,\r\n    Till thou shalt join the blessed ones, in Heaven’s serene abode.”\r\n\r\nMr. de Quincey has finely said of solitude, that, although it may be\r\nsilent as light, it is, like light, the mightiest of agencies; for\r\nsolitude is essential to man. “All men come into this world _alone_;\r\nall leave it _alone_. Even a little child has a dread, whispering\r\nconsciousness, that, if he should be summoned to travel into God’s\r\npresence, no gentle nurse will be allowed to lead him by the hand,\r\nnor mother to carry him in her arms, nor little sister to share his\r\ntrepidations.” King and priest, we are further reminded, warrior and\r\nmaiden, philosopher and child, all must walk those mighty galleries\r\nalone. The solitude, therefore, which this author describes as in this\r\nworld appalling or fascinating a child’s heart,[43] is but the echo of a\r\nfar deeper solitude, through which already he has passed, and of another\r\nsolitude, deeper still, through which he _has_ to pass: reflex of one\r\nsolitude—prefiguration of another.\r\n\r\nCrabbe says of man that, feeling his weakness, it is his habit to run to\r\nsociety, to numbers,—\r\n\r\n    “Himself to strengthen, or himself to shun;\r\n    But though to this our weakness may be prone,\r\n    Let’s learn to live, for we must die, alone.”\r\n\r\nAmong the pangs which belong to death is emphatically reckoned by F. W.\r\nRobertson, in his sermon on Victory over it, the sensation of loneliness\r\nwhich attaches to that transit through the valley of shadows. Have we\r\never, he asks, seen a ship preparing to sail with its load of pauper\r\nemigrants to a distant colony? for that is keenly suggestive of the\r\ndesolation which comes from feeling unfriended on a new and untried\r\nexcursion. He dilates on all beyond the seas being to the ignorant poor\r\nman a strange land—away from the helps and friendships and companionships\r\nof life, scarcely knowing what is before him; and it is in such a moment,\r\nwhen a man stands upon a deck, taking his last look of his fatherland,\r\nthat there comes upon him what the preacher calls “a sensation new,\r\nstrange, and inexpressibly miserable—the feeling of being alone in the\r\nworld. Brethren, with all the bitterness of such a moment, it is but a\r\nfeeble image when placed by the side of the loneliness of death. We die\r\nalone. We go on our dark mysterious journey for the first time in all our\r\nexistence, without one to accompany us. Friends are beside our bed, they\r\nmust stay behind. Grant that a Christian has something like familiarity\r\nwith the Most High, _that_ breaks this solitary feeling; but what is\r\nit with the mass of men? It is a question full of loneliness to them.”\r\nSays the elder Humboldt (Wilhelm), in one of his letters: “However many\r\ncompanions a man may have in the active sympathising world, he must ever\r\nmake the journey which leads across the boundaries of earthly things\r\nalone; no one may accompany him.” Not but that in some moods, and in some\r\nsense, this contemplative philosopher might have assented to the protest\r\nof Paul Flemming, that had we spiritual organs, to see and hear things\r\nnow invisible and inaudible to us, we should behold the air thronged with\r\nthe departing souls of that vast multitude which every moment dies. For,\r\n“truly the soul departs not alone on its last journey, but spirits of its\r\nkind attend it, when not ministering angels; and they go in families to\r\nthe unknown land. Neither in life nor in death are we alone.” But then\r\nas we have _not_ the spiritual organs in question, the fact of conscious\r\nisolation _in articulo mortis_ is not affected; and their character,\r\nafter all, pertains rather to spiritualism than to spirituality.\r\n\r\nA latter-day Christian lyrist expatiates on the sense of loneliness one\r\nhas at midnight, in the dread calmness of the dark,—or again, on pathless\r\nhills, when the sun is set, and the ear listens in vain for some social\r\nsound from afar. But,—\r\n\r\n    “If this be solitude, while life retains her healthful tone,\r\n    How shall I feel when, faint with pain,—I die alone?\r\n\r\n    “Of all the happy things that live in ocean, earth, or air,\r\n    Not one with kindred sympathy my lonely lot shall share.\r\n    My friend shall vainly scan the glance that speaks no language now;\r\n    My dog shall lick the languid hand that falters on his brow:\r\n    But none shall venture forth with me, to meet the dread unknown,\r\n    And I between two living worlds—must die alone!”\r\n\r\n_Je mourrai seul._ Pascal’s words are continually cited, though only to\r\nbe forgotten. Mrs. Browning feelingly and earnestly expands into a sonnet\r\nwhat she entitles “A Thought for a Lonely Death-bed. Inscribed to my\r\nfriend E. C.”\r\n\r\n    “If God compel thee to this destiny,\r\n    To die alone,—with none beside thy bed\r\n    To ruffle round with sobs thy last word said,\r\n    And mark with tears the pulses ebb from thee,—\r\n    Then pray alone—‘O Christ, come tenderly!\r\n    By Thy forsaken Sonship in the red\r\n    Drear wine-press,—by the wilderness outspread,—\r\n    And the lone garden where Thine agony\r\n    Fell bloody from Thy brow,—by all of those\r\n    Permitted desolations, comfort mine!\r\n    No earthly friend being near me, interpose\r\n    No deathly angel ’twixt my face and Thine,\r\n    But stoop Thyself to gather my life’s rose,\r\n    And smile away my mortal to Divine.’”\r\n\r\nOne can hardly quit this subject without recalling the awful significance\r\nof a cry that once expressed, if one may say it, inexpressible\r\nanguish,—anguish indescribable, incommunicable,—“My God, my God, why hast\r\nThou forsaken Me!” Penultimate words, these were; and appalling in their\r\nsuggestiveness of uttermost desolation. But not the last words of all. He\r\nwas not alone, consciously not alone, at the very last. Later than these,\r\nand triumphant over these—however subdued and serene the triumph—came\r\nthose other words, Divinely calm, as became the Speaker,—“Father, into\r\nThy hands I commend my spirit.” And it was when He had _this_ said, that\r\nHe gave up the ghost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] “Wave your hand; the motion which has apparently ceased is taken\r\nup by the air, from the air by the walls of the room, etc., and so\r\nby direct and re-acting waves, continually comminuted, but never\r\ndestroyed.”—_Grove’s Correlation of Physical Forces._\r\n\r\n[2] The Candidate, Lord Sandwich.\r\n\r\n[3] See on the scope of the words ἐπιθυμῶν χορτασθῆναι (St. Luke xvi.\r\n21), _Analecta Theologica_ (Rev. W. Trollope’s) _in loc._\r\n\r\n[4] Earlier in the tale there is a touch to remind us of Lear on the\r\nheath:\r\n\r\n    “‘Know you his conduct?’ ‘Yes, indeed, I know,\r\n    And how he wanders in the wind and snow;\r\n    Safe in our rooms the threatening storm we hear,\r\n    But he feels strongly what we faintly fear.’”\r\n\r\n[5] Plentiful illustrations might be drawn from Plutarch to the same\r\neffect. There is Mutius Scævola, for instance, addressing Porsenna: “Your\r\nthreatenings I regarded not, but am subdued by your generosity.” There\r\nis Porsenna himself, who, as Publicola found, could not be quelled by\r\ndint of arms, but whom he converted into a friend to Rome, by “the gentle\r\narts of persuasion.” There is young Alexander, afterwards to be, or to be\r\ncalled, the Great, whose astute father saw that he did not easily submit\r\nto authority, because he would not be forced to anything, but that he\r\nmight be led to his duty by the gentler hand of reason; and therefore, as\r\na wise father, who knew his own son, Philip took the method of persuasion\r\nrather than of command.\r\n\r\nWhat Plutarch says of the gentler hand of reason, reminds us of Swift’s\r\naccount of the _Houyhnhnms_, that “they have no conception how a rational\r\ncreature can be compelled, but only advised or exhorted.” And by the\r\nway, Swift remarks in a letter on England’s harsh rule over the Irish,\r\n“Supposing even the size of a native’s understanding just equal to that\r\nof a dog or a horse, I have often seen these two animals civilized by\r\nrewards at least as much as by punishments.”\r\n\r\nBut to return to Plutarch. There is his Flaminius, again, whose\r\nappointment to the command in the war with Macedon, he calls very\r\nfortunate for Rome, since what was required was “a general who did not\r\nwant to do everything by force and violence, but rather by gentleness and\r\npersuasion.” As Claudian says, _Peragit tranquilla potestas quad violenta\r\nnequit_.\r\n\r\nFear, observes Adam Smith, is in almost all cases a wretched instrument\r\nof government, and ought in particular never to be employed against any\r\norder of men who have the smallest pretensions to independency. “To\r\nattempt to terrify them, serves only to irritate their bad humours, and\r\nto confirm them in an opposition which more gentle usage perhaps might\r\neasily induce them, either to soften, or to lay aside altogether.”\r\n\r\n[6] The history of Latin Christianity supplies abundant examples, more or\r\nless pertinent. Columban and his disciples are characterized as having\r\nhad little of the gentle and winning perseverance of missionaries:\r\nthey had been accustomed to dictate to trembling sovereigns; and their\r\nhaughty and violent demeanour provoked the pagans, instead of weaning\r\nthem from their idolatries (iii. 106). So of Boniface (v. 167): it was\r\nin the tone of a master that he commanded the world to peace, a tone\r\nwhich provoked resistance. “It was not by persuasive influence, which\r\nmight lull the conflicting passions of men, and enlighten them as to\r\ntheir real interests.” Contrast with these the temper and policy of Pope\r\nEugenius III. (iii. 407), whose “skilful and well-timed use of means more\r\nbecoming the head of Christendom than arms and excommunications, wrought\r\nwonders in his favour;” and who, by his gentleness and charity, gradually\r\nsupplanted the senate in the attachment of the Roman people: “the fierce\r\nand intractable people were yielding to this gentler influence.” On a\r\nlater page we come across the able portraiture of our Henry II., as drawn\r\nby a churchman who was warning Becket as to the formidable adversary he\r\nhad undertaken to oppose: “He will sometimes be softened by humility and\r\npatience, but will never submit to compulsion,” etc. Ariste _a raison_\r\nwhen he counsels Geronte, in Gresset’s “Le Méchant,” as the _bien plus\r\nsage_ course of dealing with a difficult subject,\r\n\r\n    “Que vous le rameniez par raison, par douceur,\r\n    Que d’aller opposer la colère à l’humeur.”\r\n\r\n[7] “Such access as Protestantism has gained to the minds of the\r\nCatholics in Ireland, it owes, not to the thunders of any missionary\r\nBoanerges, but to men like the [late] Archbishop of Dublin [Whately],\r\nand the Dean of Elphin, who have taken a very different course, and\r\npresented Protestant Christianity to their neighbours in a very different\r\nform.”—_Saturday Review_, xi. 71.\r\n\r\n[8] Gently soothing.\r\n\r\n[9] Another type of mind, deficient in the higher attributes of\r\nindependence, is often feverishly eager to sink its sense of individual\r\nresponsibility by seeking what is called “rest in the Church.” Dr.\r\nBungener represents his Julian, when committed to the Bastile, as rather\r\nrejoicing at than terrified by the despotism of the hand laid upon him;\r\nand in the same way, on taking holy orders, he, being “subdued in heart,\r\nenslaved in mind, tired of being his own master, only to create his own\r\ntorments,” flatters himself that he gives the Church complete power over\r\nhis faculties at the same time that he gives her plenary power over his\r\nactions.\r\n\r\nTo the baser sort, remarks Sir James Stephen, no yoke is so galling\r\nas that of self control, no deliverance so welcome as that of being\r\nhandsomely rid of free agency. “With such men mental slavery readily\r\nbecomes a habit, a fashion, and a pride. To the abject many the\r\nabdication of self-government is a willing sacrifice.”\r\n\r\nOne of our acutest essayists on social subjects comments on the readiness\r\nof a man to exult in the fact that he has done something which he cannot\r\nundo, and has pledged himself to a course from which he cannot draw back,\r\nas more commonly the sign of a weak than of a strong nature. “The comfort\r\nof plunging right into the stream is unspeakable to anybody who has been\r\naccustomed to stand shivering and irresolute on the bank.” When a person\r\nof this sort, it is justly observed, has brought himself to take the\r\nplunge, his exultation and fearlessness are wonderful: the knowledge that\r\nthe Rubicon is crossed, and the die cast, seems to relieve him from the\r\nnecessity of further resolution. “He has set in motion a machine which\r\nwill of itself wind off results and consequences for him without more\r\nado on his own part; and this is an order of release from the demands of\r\ncircumstances upon his will, for which he cannot be too thankful.”\r\n\r\n[10] When at Bologna he used to visit the Campo Santo, the sexton of\r\nwhich was a favourite of his, and the “beautiful and innocent face” of\r\nwhose daughter of fifteen, he used to contrast with the skulls that\r\npeopled several cells there—and particularly with that of one skull dated\r\n1766, “which was once covered (the tradition goes) by the most lovely\r\nfeatures of Bologna—noble and rich.”\r\n\r\n[11] Not to be forgotten, however, is the suggestive rejoinder of\r\nMercury, that Menippus would have been as easily fooled as the rest of\r\nthem, had he but seen, not that grinning skull, but the living face that\r\nonce concealed it.\r\n\r\n[12] In the book called “God’s Acre; or, Historical Notices relating to\r\nChurchyards,” there is a loathsome story of a Mr. Thompson, of Worcester,\r\nwho baited his angling-hook with part of the corrupted form of King John,\r\nand carried the fish he caught with it in triumph through the streets.\r\n\r\n[13] “Et puisque le monde n’est qu’une comédie, il faut prendre la queue\r\nlapin et l’épée de bois comme les autres.”—Lettres de Chaulieu, ed. 1850.\r\n\r\n[14] Boswell’s “Life of Johnson,” April 29, 1783.\r\n\r\n[15] In the etymological sense, now practically obsolete, of misbeliever.\r\n\r\n[16] Perhaps a better version of perhaps the same story is that of the\r\nyoung Dauphin exclaiming to his right reverend preceptor, when some book\r\nmentioned a king as having died, “Quoi donc, les rois meurent-ils?”\r\n“Quelquefois, monseigneur,” was the reply—ironical, or parasitical, as\r\nmay be.\r\n\r\n[17] John Asgill distinguished himself by maintaining in a treatise now\r\nforgotten, that death is no natural necessity, and that to escape it is\r\nwithin the range of the humanly practicable. But Asgill’s biography, like\r\nevery other, has for a last page the inevitable “And he died.”\r\n\r\n[18] That is, “Let thy spirit (goste), not thy appetite, lead thee.” In\r\nSt. Peter’s words, “Abstain from fleshly lusts.”\r\n\r\n[19] St. Augustine, Lyra, Bellarmine, and others, are chargeable with\r\nthis judgment and sentence.\r\n\r\n[20] “Fortunately these things are known to Him, from whom no secrets are\r\nhidden; and let us rest in the assurance that His judgments are not as\r\nours.”—_Rogers’s Italy._\r\n\r\n[21] The friends spoken of were Coleridge and Miss Wordsworth. The scene\r\nwas the eastern shore of Grasmere. The date of the poem is 1800.\r\n\r\n[22] On the “false humility” which shrinks from all censure or\r\nreprobation of what is evil, under cover of the text “judge not, that ye\r\nbe not judged,”—as if it were the intent of that text, not to warn us\r\nagainst rash, presumptuous, and uncharitable judgments, but absolutely to\r\nforbid our taking account of the distinction between right and wrong,—see\r\nSir Henry Taylor’s essay on Humility and Independence in his valuable\r\n“Notes from Life.” The man of true humility, we are there taught, will\r\ncome to the task of judgment, on serious occasions, not lightly or\r\nunawed, but praying to have “a right judgment in all things;” and whilst\r\nexercising that judgment in no spirit of compromise or evasion, he will\r\nfeel that to judge his brother is a duty and not a privilege; and he will\r\njudge him in sorrow, humbled by the contemplation of that fallen nature\r\nof which he is himself part and parcel. (See “Notes from Life” (1847),\r\npp. 46, _sqq._)\r\n\r\n[23] Were we all turned inside out, however, Mr. Trollope elsewhere\r\nsurmises, some of us might find “our shade of brown to be very\r\ndark.”—_The Bertrams_, chap. xix.\r\n\r\n[24] The avoidance of moral _estimate_, on the other hand, is imputed\r\nto an insufficient sense of the duty incumbent on all of us to form\r\ndeterminate estimates of men and actions, if only as bearing on our own\r\nconduct in life.

Roscoe’s Essays,” vol. ii., p. 308.)\r\n\r\n[25] Owen Meredith: “The Artist.”\r\n\r\n[26] “Cleon,” by Robert Browning.\r\n\r\n[27] Completed. _Finis coronat opus._ Children and fools, it has been\r\nobserved, should not see a work that is half done, they not having the\r\nsense to make out what the artist is designing. “The whole of this world\r\nthat we see, is a work half done; and thence fools are apt to find fault\r\nwith Providence.”—ARCHBISHOP WHATELY.\r\n\r\n[28] Sonnets, by Elizabeth Barrett Browning: “Perplexed Music.”\r\n\r\n[29] He is said to have emptied two baskets of figs and of eggs, which\r\nhe swallowed alternately, and the repast was concluded with marrow and\r\nsugar. In one of his pilgrimages to Mecca, Soliman is asserted to have\r\neaten, at a single meal, seventy pomegranates, a kid, six fowls, and a\r\nhuge quantity of the grapes of Tayaf. “If,” says Gibbon, “the bill of\r\nfare be correct, we must admire the appetite rather than the luxury of\r\nthe sovereign of Asia.”—_Hist.

St. Peter\r\nwas both; yet this was his history. In a crowd, suddenly, the question\r\nwas put directly, ‘This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth?’ Then a\r\nprevarication—a lie: and yet another.”—_Sermon on the Restoration of the\r\nErring._\r\n\r\n[32] Froude, “History of Reign of Elizabeth,” vol. ii., pp. 126, 215,\r\n226, 277, 278.\r\n\r\n[33] Mr. Thackeray incidentally opposes the quasi-apologists for\r\nsmuggling on the ground that it is a complicated tissue of lying. In his\r\nvery last and unfinished work, he makes a good old rector allow that to\r\nrun an anker of brandy may seem no monstrous crime; but when men engage\r\nin these lawless ventures, who knows how far the evil will go? “I buy\r\nten kegs of brandy from a French fishing-boat, I land it under a lie\r\non the coast, I send it inland ever so far, and all my consignees lie\r\nand swindle. I land it, and lie to the revenue officer. Under a lie\r\n(that is, a mutual secrecy), I sell it to the landlord of the Bell at\r\nMaidstone, say.... My landlord sells it to a customer under a lie. We\r\nare all engaged in crime, conspiracy, and falsehood; nay, if the revenue\r\nlooks too closely after us, we out with our pistols, and to crime and\r\nconspiracy add murder. Do you suppose men engaged in lying every day\r\nwill scruple about a false oath in a witness-box? Crime engenders crime,\r\nsir.”—_Denis Duval_, chap. vii.\r\n\r\n[34] From Sir Walter Scott we might gather numerous examples and\r\naphorisms to the purpose. “It’s a sair judgment on a man,” says\r\nRatcliffe, in the “Heart of Mid-Lothian,” “when he has once gane sae\r\nfar wrang as I hae dune”—the present thief-taker being in fact an\r\nex-thief—that never a bit “he can be honest, try’t whilk way he will.”\r\nThe career of Effie Deans, anon Lady Staunton, in the same story, is a\r\npractical sermon on the same text. “I drag on,” she owns, “the life of\r\na miserable impostor, indebted for the marks of regard I receive to a\r\ntissue of deceit and lies, which the slightest accident may unravel.”\r\nHer sister, on perusing the letter which contains these confessions, is\r\nimpressed with such an instance of the staggering condition of those who\r\nhave risen to distinction by undue arts, and the “outworks and bulwarks\r\nof fiction and falsehood, by which they are under the necessity of\r\nsurrounding and defending their precarious advantages.”\r\n\r\nThen again there is old Caleb Balderstone, querulous at being what he\r\ncalls “forced” to imperil his soul “wi’ telling ae lee after another\r\nfaster than I can count them,”—and elsewhere at the “cost” of “telling\r\ntwenty daily lees to a wheen idle chaps and queans, and, what’s waur,\r\nwithout gaining credence.”\r\n\r\nAnd for another instance we have the titular Earl of Etherington, in “St.\r\nRonan’s Well,” in the position as of a spider when he perceives that his\r\ndeceitful web is threatened with danger, and sits balanced in the centre,\r\nwatching every point, and uncertain which he may be called upon first to\r\ndefend. “Such is one part, and not the slightest part, of the penance\r\nwhich never fails to wait on those, who, abandoning the ‘fair play of the\r\nworld,’ endeavour to work out their purposes by a process of deception\r\nand intrigue.”\r\n\r\nIn one of Mr. Disraeli’s earlier fictions, there is a young man whose\r\nfrankness is proverbial, but who finds himself involved in a course of\r\nprevarication—due effect being given to its preliminary process, though\r\n“only the commencement of the system of degrading deception which awaited\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most direct and forcible illustration of the subject in\r\nmodern fiction, is to be found in the “White Lies” of Mr. Charles Reade,\r\na work the title of which declares its didactic scope. Rose Beaurépaire\r\nin an unguarded moment equivocates, or tells a white lie, and thereby\r\nhangs the tale. Soon we have her bitterly bewailing the imbroglio in\r\nwhich she has involved herself and others, and the necessity of fresh\r\nfibs to maintain the meaning and credit of the first. “There is no end to\r\nit,” she sobs despairingly. “It is like a spider’s web: every struggle\r\nto be free but multiplies the fine yet irresistible thread that seems to\r\nbind me.” In the next chapter a significant paragraph intimates, “This\r\nwas the last lie the poor entangled wretch had to tell that morning.”\r\nAnd the penultimate chapter opens with a notice anew of the “fatal\r\nentanglement” into which two high-minded sisters had been led, through\r\nyielding to a natural foible: the desire, namely, to hide everything\r\npainful from those they loved, even at the expense of truth. The author\r\nlays stress on the inextricable complications due to their “amiable\r\ndishonesty,” and he importunes the reader to take notice that after the\r\nfirst White Lie or two, circumstances overpowered them, and drove them\r\non against their will. It was no small part, he insists, of all their\r\nmisery, that they longed to get back to truth and could not.\r\n\r\n[35] In apposition, or opposition, to which, note the bidding and the\r\ndemur in Talfourd’s tragedy of “Ion”:—\r\n\r\n    “_Adrastus._ No; strike at once; my hour is come: in thee\r\n    I recognise the minister of Jove,\r\n    And, kneeling thus, submit me to his power.\r\n\r\n    _Ion._ Avert thy face.\r\n\r\n    _Adras._                No; let me meet thy gaze,” etc.\r\n\r\n[36] Deut. xiii. 6. Observe too the seeming climax,—ascending from “thy\r\nbrother, the son of thy mother,” through the successive stages of “thy\r\nson, thy daughter,” and “the wife of thy bosom,” to “thy friend, which is\r\nas thine own soul.” As though\r\n\r\n    “The force of Nature could no further go.”\r\n\r\n[37] “If our friends appear to look upon us with little interest, if\r\nour arrival is seen without pleasure, and our departure without regret,\r\ninstead of charging them with a deficiency of feeling, we should turn our\r\nscrutiny upon ourselves.”—_Essays on the Formation and Publication of\r\nOpinions_, v. i.\r\n\r\n[38] Hartley Coleridge, Sonnets.\r\n\r\n[39] That is, if attention be shown him.\r\n\r\n[40] Gusts of wind.\r\n\r\n[41] See Hanna’s Life of Chalmers, Journal of 1810 and of 1825-6,\r\n_passim_.\r\n\r\n[42] “See the well-known print of Mazarin’s death-bed, surrounded by\r\nladies at cards.
