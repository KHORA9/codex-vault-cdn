In the fourth Christian century the Cynic mode of\r\nlife was adopted by many, but the vast majority were illiterate men who\r\nimitated the Cynic shamelessness of manners but not the genuine\r\ndiscipline, the self‐sufficiency (αὐτάρκεια) which had ennobled the lives\r\nof Antisthenes, Diogenes and Crates. To the virtues of these great men\r\nJulian endeavours to recall the worthless Cynics of his day. In the two\r\ncenturies that had elapsed since Lucian wrote, for the edification of\r\ndegenerate Cynics,(1) the Life of the Cynic Demonax, the dignified and\r\nwitty friend of Epictetus, the followers of that sect had still further\r\ndeteriorated. The New Cynics may be compared with the worst type of\r\nmendicant friar of the Middle Ages; and Julian saw in their assumption of\r\nthe outward signs of Cynicism, the coarse cloak, the staff and wallet, and\r\nlong hair, the same hypocrisy and greed that characterised certain of the\r\nChristian monks of his day.(2) The resemblances between the Christians and\r\nthe Cynics had already been pointed out by Aristides,(3) and while in\r\nJulian’s eyes they were equally impious, he has an additional grievance\r\nagainst the Cynics in that they brought discredit on philosophy. Like the\r\nChristians they were unlettered, they were disrespectful to the gods whom\r\nJulian was trying to restore, they had flattered and fawned on\r\nConstantius, and far from practising the austerities of Diogenes they were\r\nno better than parasites on society.\r\n\r\nIn this as in the Seventh Oration Julian’s aim is to reform the New\r\nCynics, but still more to demonstrate the essential unity of philosophy.\r\nHe sympathised profoundly with the tenets of Cynicism, and ranked Diogenes\r\nwith Socrates as a moral teacher. He reminds the Cynics whom he satirises\r\nthat the famous admonition of Diogenes to “countermark”(4) or “forge” a\r\nnew coinage is not to be taken as an excuse for license and impudence, but\r\nlike the Delphic precept “Know Thyself” warns all philosophers to accept\r\nno traditional authority, no convention that has not been examined and\r\napproved by the reason of the individual. His conviction that all\r\nphilosophical tenets are in harmony if rightly understood, gives a\r\npeculiar earnestness to his Apologia for Diogenes. The reference in the\r\nfirst paragraph to the summer solstice seems to indicate that the Oration\r\nwas written before Julian left Constantinople in order to prepare for the\r\nPersian campaign.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber’s Note: The original book had pages with Greek on the left\r\npage and the corresponding English translation on the facing right page.\r\nIn this e‐book, each Greek paragraph will be immediately followed by the\r\nEnglish translation paragraph, surrounded in parentheses. The Greek text\r\ncontains markings such as [3] and [B]; they are section and sub‐section\r\nmarkings that in the original book were in the right margin. These are\r\ndifferent from numbers within parentheses such as (10), which are used as\r\nfootnote references in some e‐book formats.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nΙΟΥΛΙΑΝΟΥ ΑΥΤΟΚΡΑΤΟΡΟΣ\r\n\r\n(Julian, Emperor)\r\n\r\nΕΙΣ ΤΟΥΣ ΑΠΑΙΔΕΥΤΟΥΣ ΚΥΝΑΣ\r\n\r\n(To the Uneducated Cynics)\r\n\r\nἌνω ποταμῶν, τοῦτο δὴ τὸ τῆς παροιμίας. ἀνὴρ Κυνικὸς Διογένη φησί\r\nκενόδοξον, καὶ ψυχρολουτεῖν οὐ βούλεται, σφόδρα ἐρρωμένος τὸ σῶμα καὶ\r\nσφριγῶν [181] καὶ τὴν ἡλικίαν ἀκμάζων, ὡς ἂν μή τι κακὸν λάβῃ, καὶ ταῦτα\r\nτοῦ θεοῦ ταῖς θεριναῖς τροπαῖς ἤδη προσιόντος. ἀλλὰ καὶ τὴν ἐδωδὴν τοῦ\r\nπολύποδος κωμῳδεῖ καί φησι τὸν Διογένη τῆς ἀνοίας καὶ κενοδοξίας\r\nἐκτετικέναι ἱκανὰς(5) δίκας ὥσπερ ὑπὸ κωνείου τῆς τροφῆς διαφθαρέντα. οὕτω\r\nπόρρω που σοφίας ἐλαύνει, ὥστε ἐπίσταται σαφῶς ὅτι κακὸν ὁ θάνατος. τοῦτο\r\nδὲ ἀγνοεῖν ὑπελάμβανεν ὁ σοφὸς Σωκράτης, ἀλλὰ καὶ μετ᾽ ἐκεῖνον Διογένης.\r\nἀρρωστοῦντι γοῦν, φασίν, ἀντισθένει μακρὰν καὶ δυσανάληπτον ἀρρωστίαν\r\nξιφίδιον ἐπέδωκεν ὁ Διογένης εἰπών· [B] εἰ φίλου χρῄζεις ὑπουργίας. οὕτως\r\nοὐδὲν ᾤετο δεινὸν ἐκεῖνος οὐδὲ ἀλγεινὸν τὸν θάνατον. ἀλλ᾽ ἡμεῖς οἱ τὸ\r\nσκῆπτρον ἐκεῖθεν παραλαβόντες ὑπὸ μείζονος σοφίας ἴσμεν ὅτι χαλεπὸν ὁ\r\nθάνατος, καὶ τὸ νοσεῖν δεινότερον αὐτοῦ φαμεν(6) τοῦ θανάτου, τὸ ῥιγοῦν δὲ\r\nχαλεπώτερον τοῦ νοσεῖν. ὁ μὲν γὰρ νοσῶν μαλακῶς ἔσθ᾽ ὅτε θεραπεύεται, ὥστε\r\nγίνεσθαι τρυφὴν αὐτόχρημα τὴν ἀρρωστίαν, ἄλλως τε κἂν ᾖ πλούσιος. [C]\r\nἐθεασάμην τοι καὶ αὐτὸς νὴ Δία τρυφώντάς τινας ἐν ταῖς νόσοις μᾶλλον ἢ\r\nτούτους αὐτοὺς ὑγιαίνοντας· καίτοι γε καὶ τότε λαμπρῶς ἐτρύφων. ὅθεν μοι\r\nκαὶ παρέστη πρός τινας τῶν ἑταίρων εἰπεῖν, ὡς τούτοις ἄμεινον ἦν οἰκέταις\r\nγενέσθαι μᾶλλον ἢ δεσπόταις, καὶ πένεσθαι τοῦ κρίνου γυμνοτέροις οὖσιν ἢ\r\nπλουτεῖν ὥσπερ νῦν. ἦ γὰρ ἂν ἐπαύσαντο νοσοῦντες ἅμα καὶ τρυφῶντες. [D] τὸ\r\nμὲν δὴ νοσοτυφεῖν καὶ νοσηλεύεσθαι τρυφηλῶς οὑτωσί τινες ἐν καλῷ\r\nποιοῦνται· ἀνὴρ δὲ τοῦ κρύους ἀνεχόμενος καὶ θάλπος καρτερῶν οὐχὶ καὶ τῶν\r\nνοσούντων ἀθλιώτερον πράττει; ἀλγεῖ γοῦν ἀπαραμύθητα.\r\n\r\n(Behold the rivers are flowing backwards,(7) as the proverb says! Here is\r\na Cynic who says that Diogenes(8) was conceited, and who refuses to take\r\ncold baths for fear they may injure him, though he has a very strong\r\nconstitution and is lusty and in the prime of life, and this too though\r\nthe Sun‐god is now nearing the summer solstice. Moreover he even ridicules\r\nthe eating of octopus and says that Diogenes paid a sufficient penalty for\r\nhis folly and vanity in that he perished of this diet(9) as though by a\r\ndraught of hemlock. So far indeed is he advanced in wisdom that he knows\r\nfor certain that death is an evil. Yet this even the wise Socrates thought\r\nhe did not know, yes and after him Diogenes as well. At any rate when\r\nAntisthenes(10) was suffering from a long and incurable illness Diogenes\r\nhanded him a dagger with these words, “In case you need the aid of a\r\nfriend.” So convinced was he that there is nothing terrible or grievous in\r\ndeath. But we who have inherited his staff know out of our greater wisdom\r\nthat death is a calamity. And we say that sickness is even more terrible\r\nthan death, and cold harder to bear than sickness. For the man who is sick\r\nis often tenderly nursed, so that his ill‐health is straightway converted\r\ninto a luxury, especially if he be rich. Indeed I myself, by Zeus, have\r\nobserved that certain persons are more luxurious in sickness than in\r\nhealth, though even in health they were conspicuous for luxury. And so it\r\nonce occurred to me to say to certain of my friends that it were better\r\nfor those men to be servants than masters, and to be poor and more naked\r\nthan the lily of the field(11) than to be rich as they now are. For they\r\nwould have ceased being at once sick and luxurious. The fact is that some\r\npeople think it a fine thing to make a display of their ailments and to\r\nplay the part of luxurious invalids. But, says someone, is not a man who\r\nhas to endure cold and to support heat really more miserable than the\r\nsick? Well, at any rate he has no comforts to mitigate his sufferings.)\r\n\r\nΔεῦρο οὖν ἡμεῖς ὑπὲρ τῶν Κυνικῶν ὁπόσα διδασκάλων ἠκούσαμεν ἐν κοινῷ\r\nκαταθῶμεν σκοπεῖν τοῖς ἐπὶ τὸν βίον ἰοῦσι τοῦτον· οἷς εἰ μὲν πεισθεῖεν, εὖ\r\nοἶδα, [182] οὐδὲν οἵ γε νῦν ἐπιχειροῦντες κυνίζειν ἔσονται χείρους·\r\nἀπειθοῦντες δὲ εἰ μέν τι λαμπρὸν καὶ σεμνὸν ἐπιτηδεύσειαν, ὑπερφωνοῦντες\r\nτὸν λόγον τὸν ἡμέτερον, οὔτι τοῖς ῥήμασιν ἀλλὰ τοῖς ἔργοις, οὐδὲν ἐμπόδιον\r\nὃ γε ἡμέτερος οἴσει λόγος· εἰ δὲ ὑπὸ λιχνείας ἢ μαλακίας ἤ, τὸ κεφάλαιον\r\nἵν᾽ εἴπω ξυνελὲν ἐν βραχεῖ, τῆς σωματικῆς ἡδονῆς δεδουλωμένοι τῶν λόγων\r\nὀλιγωρήσειαν προσκαταγελάσαντες, [B] ὥσπερ ἐνίοτε τῶν παιδευτηρίων καὶ τῶν\r\nδικαστηρίων οἱ κύνες τοῖς προπυλαίοις προσουροῦσιν, οὐ φροντὶς Ἰπποκλείδῃ·\r\nκαὶ γὰρ οὐδὲ τῶν κυνιδίων ἡμῖν μέλει τὰ τοιαῦτα πλημμελούντων. δεῦρο οὖν\r\nἄνωθεν ἐν κεφαλαίοις διεξέλθωμεν ἐφεξῆς τὸν λόγον, ἵνα ὑπὲρ ἑκάστου τὸ\r\nπροσῆκον ἀποδιδόντες αὐτοί τε εὐκολώτερον ἀπεργασώμεθα τοῦθ᾽ ὅπερ\r\nδιενοήθημεν καὶ σοὶ ποιήσωμεν εὐπαρακολούθητον. οὐκοῦν ἐπειδὴ [C] τὸν\r\nκυνισμὸν εἶδός τι φιλοσοφίας εἶναι συμβέβηκεν, οὔτι φαυλότατον οὐδὲ\r\nἀτιμότατον, ἀλλὰ τοῖς κρατίστοις ἀνάμιλλον, ὀλίγα πρότερον ὑπὲρ αὐτῆς\r\nῥητέον ἡμῖν ἐστι τῆς φιλοσοφίας.\r\n\r\n(Come now, let me set down for the benefit of the public what I learned\r\nfrom my teachers about the Cynics, so that all who are entering on this\r\nmode of life may consider it. And if they are convinced by what I say,\r\nthose who are now aiming to be Cynics will, I am sure, be none the worse\r\nfor it: and if they are unconvinced but cherish aims that are brilliant\r\nand noble, and set themselves above my argument not in words only but in\r\ndeeds, then my discourse will at any rate put no hindrance in their way.\r\nBut if there are others already enslaved by greed or self‐indulgence, or\r\nto sum it up briefly in a single phrase, by the pleasures of the body, and\r\nthey therefore neglect my words or even laugh them down—just as dogs\r\nsometimes defile the front porticoes of schools and law‐courts,—“’Tis all\r\none to Hippocleides,”(12) for indeed we take no notice of puppies who\r\nbehave in this fashion. Come then let me pursue my argument under headings\r\nfrom the beginning in due order, so that by giving every question its\r\nproper treatment I may myself more conveniently achieve what I have in\r\nmind and may make it more easy for you also to follow. And since it is a\r\nfact that Cynicism is a branch of philosophy, and by no means the most\r\ninsignificant or least honourable, but rivalling the noblest, I must first\r\nsay a few words about philosophy itself.)\r\n\r\nἩ τῶν θεῶν εἰς ἀνθρώπους δόσις ἅμα φανοτάτῳ πυρὶ διὰ Προμηθέως\r\nκαταπεμφθεῖσα(13) ἐξ ἡλίου μετὰ τῆς Ἑρμοῦ μερίδος οὐχ ἕτερον ἐστι παρὰ τὴν\r\nτοῦ λόγου καὶ νοῦ διανομήν· ὁ γάρ τοι Προμηθεύς, ἡ πάντα ἐπιτροπεύουσα τὰ\r\nθνητὰ πρόνοια, [D] πνεῦμα ἔνθερμον ὥσπερ ὄργανον ὑποβάλλουσα τῇ φύσει,\r\nἅπασι μετέδωκεν ἀσωμάτου λόγου· μετέσχε δὲ ἕκαστον οὗπερ ἠδύνατο, τὰ μὲν\r\nἄψυχα σώματα τῆς ἕξεως μόνον, τὰ φυτὰ δὲ ἤδη καὶ τῆς ζωῆς(14) τὰ ζῷα δὲ\r\nψυχῆς, ὁ δὲ ἄνθρωπος καὶ λογικῆς ψυχῆς. εἰσὶ μὲν οὖν οἳ μίαν οὄονται διὰ\r\nτούτων πάντων ἥκειν φύσιν, εἰσὶ δὲ οἱ καὶ κατ᾽ εἶδος ταῦτα διαφέρειν. ἀλλὰ\r\nμήπω τοῦτο, μᾶλλον δὲ μηδὲ ἐν τῷ νῦν λόγῳ τοῦτο ἐξεταζέσθω, πλὴν ἐκείνου\r\nχάριν, [183] ὅτι, τὴν φιλοσοφίαν εἴθ᾽, ὥσπερ τινὲς ὑπολαμβάνουσι, τέχνην\r\nτεχνῶν καὶ ἐπιστήμην ἐπιστημῶν, εἴτε ὁμοίωσιν θεῷ(15) κατὰ τὸ δυνατόν,\r\nεἴθ᾽, ὅπερ ὁ Πύθιος ἔφη, τὸ Γνῶθι σαυτὸν ὑπολάβοι τις, οὐδὲν διοίσει πρὸς\r\nτὸν λόγον· ἅπαντα γὰρ ταῦτα φαίνεται πρὸς ἄλληλα καὶ μάλα οἰκείως ἔχοντα.\r\n\r\n(The gift of the gods sent down to mankind with the glowing flame of\r\nfire(16) from the sun through the agency of Prometheus along with the\r\nblessings that we owe to Hermes(17) is no other than the bestowal of\r\nreason and mind. For Prometheus, the Forethought that guides all things\r\nmortal by infusing into nature a fiery breath to serve as an operative\r\ncause, gave to all things a share in incorporeal reason. And each thing\r\ntook what share it could; lifeless bodies only a state of existence;\r\nplants received life besides, and animals soul, and man a reasoning soul.\r\nNow some think that a single substance is the basis of all these, and\r\nothers that they differ essentially according to their species. But this\r\nquestion we must not discuss as yet, or rather not at all in the present\r\ndiscourse, and we need only say that whether one regards philosophy, as\r\nsome people do, as the art of arts and the science of sciences or as an\r\neffort to become like God, as far as one may, or whether, as the Pythian\r\noracle said, it means “Know thyself,” will make no difference to my\r\nargument. For all these definitions are evidently very closely related to\r\none another.)\r\n\r\nἈρξώμεθα δὲ πρῶτον ἀπὸ τοῦ Γνῶθι σαυτόν, ἐπειδὴ καὶ θεῖόν ἐστι τοῦτο τὸ\r\nπαρακέλευσμα. οὐκοῦν ὁ γιγνώσκων [B] αὑτὸν εἴσεται μὲν περὶ ψυχῆς, εἴσεται\r\nδὲ καὶ περὶ σώματος. καὶ τοῦτο οὐκ ἀρκέσει μόνον, ὡς ἔστιν ἄνθρωπος ψυχὴ\r\nχρωμένη σώματι, μαθεῖν, ἀλλὰ καὶ αὐτῆς τῆς ψυχῆς ἐπελεύσεται τὴν οὐσίαν,\r\nἔπειτα ἀνιχνεύσει τὰς δυνάμεις. καὶ οὐδὲ τοῦτο μόνον ἀρκέσει αὐτῷ, ἀλλὰ\r\nκαί, εἴ τι τῆς ψυχῆς ἐν ἡμῖν ἐστι κρεῖττον καὶ θειότερον, ὅπερ δὴ πάντες\r\nἀδιδάκτως πειθόμενοι θεῖόν τι εἶναι νομίζομεν, [C] καὶ τοῦτο ἐνιδρῦσθαι\r\nπάντες οὐρανῷ κοινῶς ὑπολαμβάνομεν. ἐπιὼν δὲ αὖθις τὰς ἀρχὰς τοῦ σώματος\r\nσκέψεται, εἴτε σύνθετον εἴτε ἁπλοῦν ἐστιν· εἶτα ὁδῷ προβαίνων ὑπέρ τε\r\nἁρμονίας αὐτοῦ καὶ πάθους καὶ δυνάμεως καὶ πάντων ἁπλῶς ὧν δεῖται πρὸς\r\nδιαμονήν. ἐπιβλέψει δὲ τὸ μετὰ τοῦτο καὶ ἀρχαῖς τεχνῶν ἐνίων, ὑφ᾽ ὧν\r\nβοηθεῖται πρὸς διαμονὴν τὸ σῶμα, οἷον ἰατρικῆς, [D] γεωργίας, ἑτέρων\r\nτοιούτων. οὐ μὴν οὐδὲ τῶν ἀχρήστων καὶ περιττῶν τι παντάπασιν ἀγνοήσει,\r\nἐπεὶ καὶ ταῦτα(18) πρὸς κολακείαν τοῦ παθητικοῦ τῆς ψυχῆς ἡμῶν\r\nἐπινενόηται. προσλιπαρῆσαι μὲν γὰρ τούτοις ἀποκνήσει αἰσχρὸν οἰόμενος τὸ\r\nτοιοῦτον, τὸ δοκοῦν ἐργῶδες ἐν αὐτοῖς φεύγων· τὸ δ᾽ ὅλον ὁποῖα ἄττα δοκεῖ\r\nκαὶ οἷστισιν ἁρμόττει τῆς ψυχῆς μέρεσιν, οὐκ ἀγνοήσει. σκόπει δή, εἰ μὴ τὸ\r\nἑαυτὸν γνῶναι πάσης μὲν ἐπιστήμης, πάσης δὲ τέχνης ἡγεῖταί τε ἅμα καὶ τοὺς\r\nκαθόλου λόγους συνείληφε. [184] τά τε γὰρ θεῖα διὰ τῆς ἐνούσης ἡμῖν θείας\r\nμερίδος τά τε θνητὰ διὰ τῆς θνητοειδοῦς μοίρας πρὸς τούτοις †προσήκειν ἔφη\r\nτὸ μεταξὺ τούτων ζῷον εἰδέναι, τὸν ἄνθρωπον†,(19) τῷ μὲν καθ᾽ ἕκαστον\r\nθνητόν, τῷ παντὶ δὲ ἀθάνατον, καὶ μέντοι καὶ τὸν ἕνα καὶ τὸν καθ᾽ ἕκαστον\r\nσυγκεῖσθαι ἐκ θνητῆς καὶ ἀθανάτου μερίδος.\r\n\r\n(However, let us begin with “Know thyself,” since this precept is divinely\r\ninspired.(20) It follows that he who knows himself will know not only\r\nabout his soul but his body also. And it will not be enough to know that a\r\nman is a soul employing a body, but he will also investigate the essential\r\nnature of the soul, and then trace out its faculties. And not even this\r\nalone will be enough for him, but in addition he will investigate whatever\r\nexists in us nobler and more divine than the soul, that something which we\r\nall believe in without being taught and regard as divine, and all in\r\ncommon suppose to be established in the heavens. Then again, as he\r\ninvestigates the first principles of the body he will observe whether it\r\nis composite or simple; then proceeding systematically he will observe its\r\nharmony and the influences that affect it and its capacity and, in a word,\r\nall that it needs to ensure its permanence. And in the next place he will\r\nalso observe the first principles of certain arts by which the body is\r\nassisted to that permanence, for instance, medicine, husbandry and the\r\nlike. And of such arts as are useless and superfluous he will not be\r\nwholly ignorant, since these too have been devised to humour the emotional\r\npart of our souls. For though he will avoid the persistent study of these\r\nlast, because he thinks such persistent study disgraceful, and will avoid\r\nwhat seems to involve hard work in those subjects; nevertheless he will\r\nnot, generally speaking, remain in ignorance of their apparent nature and\r\nwhat parts of the soul they suit. Reflect therefore, whether self‐\r\nknowledge does not control every science and every art, and moreover\r\nwhether it does not include the knowledge of universals. For to know\r\nthings divine through the divine part in us, and mortal things too through\r\nthe part of us that is mortal—this the oracle declared to be the duty of\r\nthe living organism that is midway between these, namely man; because\r\nindividually he is mortal, but regarded as a whole he is immortal, and\r\nmoreover, singly and individually, is compounded of a mortal and an\r\nimmortal part.)\r\n\r\nὍτι μέντοι καὶ τὸ τῷ θεῲ κατὰ δύναμιν ὁμοιοῦσθαι οὐκ ἄλλο τί ἐστιν ἢ τὸ\r\nτὴν ἐφικτὴν ἀνθρώποις γνῶσιν τῶν ὄντων περιποιήσασθαι, πρόδηλον ἐντεῦθεν.\r\n[B] οὐ γὰρ ἐπὶ πλούτῳ χρημάτων τὸ θεῖον μακαρίζομεν οὐδὲ ἐπ᾽ ἄλλῳ τινὶ τῶν\r\nνομιζομένων ἀγαθῶν, ἀλλ᾽ ὅπερ Ὅμηρός φησι\r\n\r\n(Further, that to make oneself like God as far as possible is nothing else\r\nthan to acquire such knowledge of the essential nature of things as is\r\nattainable by mankind, is evident from the following. It is not on the\r\nscore of abundance of possessions that we count the divine nature happy,\r\nnor on the score of any other of those things that are commonly believed\r\nto be advantages, but it is because, as Homer says,)\r\n\r\n\r\n    θεοὶ δέ τε πάντα ἴσασι,\r\n\r\n    (“The gods know all things”;(21))\r\n\r\n\r\nκαὶ μέντοι καὶ περὶ Διὸς\r\n\r\n(and indeed he says also of Zeus,)\r\n\r\n\r\n    ἀλλὰ Ζεὺς πρότερος γεγόνει καὶ πλείονα ᾔδει·\r\n\r\n    (“But Zeus was older and wiser.”(22))\r\n\r\n\r\n[C] ἐπιστήμῃ γὰρ ἡμῶν οἱ θεοὶ διαφέρουσιν. ἡγεῖται γὰρ ἴσως καὶ αὐτοῖς τῶν\r\nκαλῶν τὸ αὑτοὺς γινώσκειν· ὄσῳ δὴ κρείττονες ἡμῶν εἰσι τὴν οὐσίαν, τοσούτῳ\r\nγνόντες ἑαυτοὺς ἴσχουσι βελτιόνων γνώσιν. μηδεὶς οὖν ἡμῖν τὴν φιλοσοφίαν\r\nεἰς πολλὰ διαιρείτω μηδὲ εἰς πολλὰ τεμνέτω, μᾶλλον δὲ μὴ πολλὰς ἐκ μιᾶς\r\nποιείτω. ὥσπερ γὰρ ἀλήθεια μία, οὕτω δὲ καὶ φιλοσοφία μία· θαυμαστὸν δὲ\r\nοὐδέν, εἰ κατ᾽ ἄλλας καὶ ἄλλας ὁδοὺς ἐπ᾽ αὐτὴν πορευόμεθα. ἐπεὶ κἄν, [D]\r\nεἴ τις θέλοι τὼν ξένων ἢ ναὶ μὰ Δία τῶν πάλαι πολιτῶν ἐπανελθεῖν εἰς\r\nἈθήνας, δύναιτο μὲν καὶ πλεῖν καὶ βαδίζειν, ὁδεύων δὲ οἶμαι διὰ γῆς ἢ ταῖς\r\nπλατείαις χρῆσθαι λεωφόροις ἢ ταῖς ἀτραποῖς καὶ συντόμοις ὁδοῖς· καὶ πλεῖν\r\nμέντοι δυνατὸν παρὰ τοὺς αἰγιαλούς, καὶ δὴ καὶ κατὰ τὸν Πύλιον γέροντα\r\nτέμνοντα πέλαγος μέσον. μὴ δὲ τοῦτό τις ἡμῖν προφερέτω, εἴ τινες τῶν κατ᾽\r\nαὐτὰς ἰόντων τὰς ὁδοὺς ἀπεπλανήθησαν καὶ ἀλλαχοῦ που γενόμενοι, [185]\r\nκαθάπερ ὑπὸ τῆς Κίρκης ἢ τῶν Λωτοφάγων ἡδονῆς ἢ δόξης ᾿ἤ τινος ἄλλου\r\nδελεασθέντες, ἀπελείφθησαν τοῦ πρόσω βαδίζειν καὶ ἐφικνεῖσθαι τοῦ τέλους,\r\nτοὺς πρωτεύσαντας δὲ ἐν ἑκάστῃ τῶν αἱρέσεων σκοπείτω, καὶ πάντα εὑρήσει\r\nσύμφωνα.\r\n\r\n(For it is in knowledge that the gods surpass ourselves. And it may well\r\nbe that with them also what ranks as noblest is self‐knowledge. In\r\nproportion then as they are nobler than we in their essential nature, that\r\nself‐knowledge of theirs is a knowledge of higher things. Therefore, I\r\nsay, let no one divide philosophy into many kinds or cut it up into many\r\nparts, or rather let no one make it out to be plural instead of one. For\r\neven as truth is one, so too philosophy is one. But it is not surprising\r\nthat we travel to it now by one road, now by another. For if any stranger,\r\nor, by Zeus, any one of her oldest inhabitants wished to go up to Athens,\r\nhe could either sail or go by road, and if he travelled by land he could,\r\nI suppose, take either the broad highways or the paths and roads that are\r\nshort cuts. And moreover he could either sail along the coasts or, like\r\nthe old man of Pylos,(23) “cleave the open sea.” And let no one try to\r\nrefute me by pointing out that some philosophers in travelling by those\r\nvery roads have been known to lose their way, and arriving in some other\r\nplace have been captivated, as though by Circe or the Lotus‐Eaters, that\r\nis to say by pleasure or opinion or some other bait, and so have failed to\r\ngo straight forward and attain their goal. Rather he must consider those\r\nwho in every one of the philosophic sects did attain the highest rank, and\r\nhe will find that all their doctrines agree.)\r\n\r\nΟὐκοῦν ὁ μὲν ἐν Δελφοῖς θεὸς τὸ Γνῶθι σαυτὸν προαγορεύει, Ἡράκλειτος δὲ\r\n“ἐδιζησάμην ἐμεωυτόν,” ἀλλὰ καὶ Πυθαγόρας οἵ τε ἀπ᾽ ἐκείνου μέχρι\r\nΘεοφράστου τὸ κατὰ δύναμιν ὁμοιοῦσθαι θεῷ φασι, καὶ γὰρ καὶ Ἀριστοτέλης. ὃ\r\nγὰρ ἡμεῖς ποτέ, τοῦτο ὁ θεὸς ἀεί. γελοῖον οὖν ἂν εἴη τὸν θεὸν ἑαυτὸν μὴ\r\nεἰδέναι· κομιδῇ γὰρ οὐδὲν εἴσεται τῶν ἄλλων, εἴπερ ἑαυτὸν ἀγνοοίη· πάντα\r\nγὰρ αὐτός ἐστιν, εἴπερ καὶ ἐν ἑαυτῷ καὶ παρ᾽ ἑαυτῷ ἔχει τῶν ὁπωσοῦν ὄντων\r\nτὰς αἰτίας, εἴτε ἀθανάτων ἀθανάτους, εἴτε ἐπικήρων οὐ θνητὰς οὐδὲ\r\nἐπικήρους, ἀιδίους δὲ καὶ μενούσας ἀεὶ καὶ αἳ τούτοις εἰσὶν αἰτίαι τῆς\r\nἀειγενεσίας.

For what we are sometimes, God is always.(25) It\r\nwould therefore be absurd that God should not know himself. For he will\r\nknow nothing at all about other things if he be ignorant of himself. For\r\nhe is himself everything, seeing that in himself and near himself he keeps\r\nthe causes of all things that in any way whatever have existence, whether\r\nthey be immortal causes of things immortal, or causes of perishable\r\nthings, though themselves not mortal or perishable; for imperishable and\r\never‐abiding are the causes of perpetual generation for the perishable\r\nworld. But this line of argument is too lofty for the occasion.)\r\n\r\nὍτι δὲ μία τέ ἐστιν ἀλήθεια καὶ φιλοσοφία μία καὶ ταύτης εἰσὶν ἐρασταὶ\r\nξύμπαντες ὧν τε ὑπεμνήσθην μικρῷ πρότερον ὧν τε ἐν δίκῃ νῦν εἴποιμι ἂν\r\nτοὔνομα, τοὺς τοῦ Κιτιέως ὁμιλητὰς λέγω, οἳ τὰς πόλεις ἰδόντες\r\nἀποδιδρασκούσας τὸ λίαν ἀκραιφνὲς καὶ καθαρὸν τῆς ἐλευθερίας τοῦ κυνὸς\r\nἐσκέπασαν αὐτὸν [D] ὥσπερ οἶμαι παραπετάσμασιν οἰκονομίᾳ καὶ τῇ\r\nχρηματιστικῇ καὶ τῇ πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα συνόδῳ καὶ παιδοτροφίᾳ, ἴν᾽ οἶμαι\r\nταῖς πόλεσιν αὐτὸν ἐγγύθεν ἐπιστήσωσι φύλακα· ὅτι δὲ τὸ Γνῶθι σαυτὸν\r\nκεφάλαιον τίθενται φιλοσοφίας, οὐ μόνον ἐξ ὧν κατεβάλλοντο ξυγγραμμάτων\r\nὑπὲρ αὐτοῦ τοῦτου πεισθείης ἄν, εἴπερ ἐθέλοις, ἀλλὰ πολὺ πλέον ἀπὸ τοῦ τῆς\r\nφιλοσοφίας τέλους· τὸ γὰρ ὁμολογουμένως [186] ζῆν τῇ φύσει τέλος\r\nἐποιήσαντο, οὗπερ οὐχ οἷόv τε τυχεῖν τὸν ἀγνοοῦντα, τίς καὶ ὁποῖος\r\nπέφυκεν· ὁ γὰρ ἀγνοῶν ὅστις ἐστίν, οὐκ εἴσεται δήπουθεν ὅ, τι πράττειν\r\nἑαυτῷ προσήκει, ὥσπερ οὐδ᾽ ὁ(26) τὸν σίδηρον ἀγνοῶν εἴσεται, εἴτε αὐτῷ\r\nτέμνειν εἴτε μὴ προσήκει, καὶ ὅτου δεῖ τῷ σιδήρῳ πρὸς τὸ δύνασθαι τὸ\r\nἑαυτοῦ πράττειν· ἀλλ᾽ ὅτι μὲν ἡ φιλοσοφία μία τέ ἐστι καὶ πάντες ὡς ἔπος\r\nεἰπεῖν ἑνός τινος ἐφιέμενοι ὁδοῖς ἐπὶ τοῦτο διαφόροις ἦλθον, [B] ἀπόχρη\r\nτοσαῦτα νῦν εἰπεῖν. ὑπὲρ δὲ τοῦ Κυνισμοῦ σκεπτέον ἔτι.(27)\r\n\r\n(Now truth is one and philosophy is one, and they whom I just now spoke of\r\nare its lovers one and all; and also they whom I ought in fairness to\r\nmention now by name, I mean the disciples of the man of Citium.(28) For\r\nwhen they saw that the cities of Greece were averse to the excessive\r\nplainness and simplicity of the Cynic’s freedom of manners, they hedged\r\nhim about with screens as it were, I mean with maxims on the management of\r\nthe household and business and intercourse with one’s wife and the rearing\r\nof children, to the end, I believe, that they might make him the intimate\r\nguardian of the public welfare.(29) And that they too held the maxim “Know\r\nThyself” to be the first principle of their philosophy you may believe, if\r\nyou will, not only from the works that they composed on this very subject,\r\nbut even more from what they made the end and aim of their philosophic\r\nteaching. For this end of theirs was life in harmony with nature, and this\r\nit is impossible for any man to attain who does not know who and of what\r\nnature he is. For a man who does not know himself will certainly not know\r\nwhat it is becoming for him to do; just as he who does not know the nature\r\nof iron will not know whether it is suitable to cut with or not, and how\r\niron must be treated so that it may be put to its proper use. For the\r\nmoment however I have said enough to show that philosophy is one, and\r\nthat, to speak generally, all philosophers have a single aim though they\r\narrive at that aim by different roads. And now let us consider the Cynic\r\nphilosophy.)\r\n\r\nΕἰ μὲν οὖν ἐπεποίητο τοῖς ἀνδράσι μετά τινος σπουδῆς, ἀλλὰ μὴ μετὰ παιδιᾶς\r\nτὰ συγγράμματα, τούτοις ἐχρῆν ἑπόμενον ἐπιχειρεῖν ἕκαστα ὧν διανοούμεθα\r\nπερὶ τοῦ πράγματος ἐξετάζειν τὸν ἐναντίον καὶ, εἰ μὲν ἐφαίνετο τοῖς\r\nπαλαιοῖς ὁμολογοῦντα, μήτοι ψευδομαρτυριῶν ἡμῖν ἐπισκήπτειν, εἰ δὲ μή,\r\nτότε ἐξορίζειν αὐτὰ τῆς ἀκοῆς ὥσπερ Ἀθηναῖοι τὰ ψευδῆ γράμματα τοῦ\r\nΜητρῴου. ἐπεὶ δὲ οὐδὲν ἐστιν, [C] ὡς ἔφην, τοιοῦτον· αἵ τε γὰρ θρυλούμεναι\r\nΔιογένους τραγῳδίαι Φιλίσκου τινὸς Αἰγινήτου λέγονται εἶναι, καί, εἰ\r\nΔιογένους δὴ(30) εἶεν, οὐδὲν ἄτοπόν ἐστι τὸν σοφὸν παίζειν, ἐπεί καὶ τοῦτο\r\nπολλοὶ φαίνονται τῶν φιλοσόφων ποιήσαντες· ἐγέλα τοι, φασί, καὶ Δημόκριτος\r\nὁρῶν σπουδάζοντας τοὺς ἀνθρώπους· μὴ δὴ πρὸς τὰς παιδιὰς αὐτῶν\r\nἀποβλέπωμεν, ὥσπερ οἱ μανθάνειν τι [D] σπουδαῖον ἥκιστα ἐρῶντες, πόλει\r\nπαραβάλλοντες εὐδαίμονι, πολλῶν μὲν ἱερῶν, πολλῶν δὲ ἀπορρήτων τελετῶν\r\nπλήρει, καὶ μυρίων ἔνδον ἱερέων ἁγνῶν ἐν ἁγνοῖς μενόντων χωρίοις· αὐτοῦ δὲ\r\nἕνεκα πολλάκις τούτου, λέγω δὲ τοῦ καθαρεύειν τὰ εἴσω πάντα, τὰ περιττὰ\r\nκαὶ βδελυρὰ καὶ φαῦλα τῆς πόλεως ἀπεληλακόσι,(31) λουτρὰ δημόσια καὶ\r\nχαμαιτυπεῖα καὶ καπηλεῖα καὶ πάντα ἁπλῶς τὰ τοιαῦτα· εἶτα ἄχρι τούτου\r\nγενόμενοι εἴσω μὴ παρίασιν.(32) ὁ μὲν γὰρ τοῖς τοιούτοις ἐντυχών, [187]\r\nεἶτα τοῦτο οἰηθεὶς εἶναι τὴν πόλιν ἄθλιος μὲν ἀποφυγών, ἀθλιώτερος δὲ κάτω\r\nμείνας, ἐξὸν ὑπερβάντα μικρὸν ἰδεῖν τὸν Σωκράτη· χρήσομαι γὰρ ἐκείνοις ἐγὼ\r\nτοῖς ῥήμασιν, οἷς Ἀλκιβιάδης ἐπαινῶν Σωκράτη. φημὶ γὰρ δὴ τὴν Κυνικὴν\r\nφιλοσοφίαν ὁμοιοτάτην εἶναι τοῖς Σειληνοῖς τούτοις τοῖς ἐν τοῖς\r\nἑρμογλυφείοις καθημένοις, οὕστινας ἐργάζονται οἱ δημιουργοὶ σύριγγας ἢ\r\nαὐλοὺς ἔχοντας· οἳ διχάδε(33) [B] διοιχθέντες ἔνδον φαίνονται ἀγάλματα\r\nἔχοντες θεῶν. ὡς ἂν οὖν μὴ τοιοῦτόν τι πάθωμεν, ὅσα ἔπαιξε ταῦτα αὐτὸν\r\nἐσπουδακέναι νομίσαντες· ἔστι μὲν γάρ τι καὶ ἐν ἐκείνοις οὐκ ἄχρηστον, ὁ\r\nΚυνισμὸς δέ ἐστιν ἕτερον, ὡς αὐτίκα μάλα δεῖξαι πειράσομαι· δεῦρο ἴδωμεν\r\nἐφεξῆς ἀπὸ τῶν ἔργων, ὥσπερ αἱ ἐξιχνεύουσαι κύνες μεταθέουσι τὰ θηρία.\r\n\r\n(If the Cynics had composed treatises with any serious purpose and not\r\nmerely with a frivolous aim, it would have been proper for my opponent to\r\nbe guided by these and to try in each case to refute the opinions that I\r\nhold on the subject; and then, if they proved to be in harmony with those\r\noriginal doctrines, he could not attack me for bearing false witness; but\r\nif they proved not to be in harmony, then he could have barred my opinions\r\nfrom a hearing, as the Athenians barred spurious documents from the\r\nMetroum.(34) But, as I said, nothing of that sort exists. For the much‐\r\ntalked‐of tragedies of Diogenes are now said to be the work of a certain\r\nPhiliscus(35) of Aegina; though even if they were by Diogenes there would\r\nbe nothing out of the way in a wise man’s jesting, since many philosophers\r\nhave been known to do so. For Democritus also, we are told, used to laugh\r\nwhen he saw men taking things seriously. Well then I say we must not pay\r\nany attention to their frivolous writings, like men who have no desire at\r\nall to learn anything of serious interest. Such men when they arrive at a\r\nprosperous city abounding in sacrifices and secret rites of many kinds,\r\nand containing within it countless holy priests who dwell in the sacred\r\nenclosures, priests who for this very purpose, I mean in order to purify\r\neverything that is within their gates, have expelled all that is sordid\r\nand superfluous and vicious from the city, public baths and brothels, and\r\nretail shops, and everything of the sort without exception: such men, I\r\nsay, having come as far as the quarter where all such things are, do not\r\nenter the city itself. Surely a man who, when he comes upon the things\r\nthat have been expelled, thinks that this is the city, is despicable\r\nindeed if he depart on the instant, but still more despicable if he stay\r\nin that lower region, when he might by taking but a step across the\r\nthreshold behold Socrates himself. For I will borrow those famous phrases\r\nof Alcibiades in his praise of Socrates,(36) and I assert that the Cynic\r\nphilosophy is very like those images of Silenus that sit in the shops of\r\nthe statuaries, which the craftsmen make with pipes or flutes in their\r\nhands, but when you open them you see that inside they contain statues of\r\nthe gods. Accordingly, that we may not make that sort of mistake and think\r\nthat his jesting was sober earnest (for though there is a certain use even\r\nin those jests, yet Cynicism itself is something very different, as I\r\nshall presently try to prove), let us consider it in due course from its\r\nactual practice and pursue it like hounds that track down wild beasts in\r\nthe chase.)\r\n\r\nἩγεμόνα μὲν οὖν οὐ ῥᾴδιον εὑρεῖν, ἐφ᾽ ὃν ἀνενέγκαι χρὴ πρῶτον αὐτό, [C] εἰ\r\nκαί τινες ὑπολαμβάνουσιν ἀντισθένει τοῦτο καὶ Διογένει προσήκειν. τοῦτο\r\nγοῦν ἔοικεν Οἰνόμαος οὐκ ἀτόπως λέγειν· ὁ Κυνισμὸς οὔτε Ἀντισθενισμός\r\nἐστιν οὔτε Διογενισμός. λέγουσι μὲν γὰρ οἱ γενναιότεροι τῶν κυνῶν, ὅτι καὶ\r\nὁ μέγας Ἡρακλῆς, ὥσπερ οὖν τῶν ἄλλων ἀγαθῶν ἡμῖν(37) αἴτιος κατέστη, οὕτω\r\nδὲ καὶ τούτου τοῦ βίου παράδειγμα τὸ μέγιστον(38) κατέλιπεν ἀνθρώποις. ἐγὼ\r\nδὲ ὑπὲρ τῶν θεῶν καὶ τῶν εἰς θείαν λῆξιν πορευθέντων εὐφημεῖν ἐθέλων [D]\r\nπείθομαι μὲν καὶ πρὸ τούτου τινὰς οὐκ ἐν Ἕλλησι μόνον, ἀλλὰ καὶ βαρβάροις\r\nοὕτω φιλοσοφῆσαι·(39) αὕτη γὰρ ἡ φιλοσοφία κοινή πως ἔοικεν εἶναι καὶ\r\nφυσικωτάτη καὶ δεῖσθαι οὐδ᾽ ἡστινοσοῦν πραγματείας· ἀλλὰ ἀπόχρη μόνον\r\nἑλέσθαι τὰ σπουδαῖα ἀρετῆς ἐπιθυμίᾳ καὶ φυγῇ κακίας, καὶ οὔτε βίβλους\r\nἀνελίξαι δεῖ μυρίας· πολυμαθία γάρ, φασί, νόον οὐ διδάσκει· οὔτε ἄλλο τι\r\nτῶν τοιούτων παθεῖν, ὅσα καὶ οἷα πάσχουσιν οἱ διὰ τῶν ἄλλων αἱρέσεων\r\nἰόντες, [188] ἀλλὰ ἀπόχρη μόνον δύο ταῦτα τοῦ Πυθίου παραινοῦντος ἀκοῦσαι,\r\nτὸ Γνῶθι σαυτὸν καὶ Παραχάραξον τὸ νόμισμα· πέφηνεν οὖν ἡμῖν ἀρχηγὸς τῆς\r\nφιλοσοφίας ὅσπερ οἶμαι τοῖς Ἕλλησι κατέστη τῶν καλῶν ἁπάντων αἴτιος, ὁ τῆς\r\nἙλλάδος κοινὸς ἡγεμὼν καὶ νομοθέτης καὶ βασιλεύς, ὁ ἐν Δελφοῖς θεός, ὃν\r\nἐπειδὴ μὴ θέμις ἦν τι διαλαθεῖν, οὐδὲ ἡ Διογένους ἐπιτηδειότης ἔλαθε.\r\nπρούτρεψε δὲ αὐτὸν οὐχ ὥσπερ τοὺς ἄλλους ἔπεσιν ἐντείνων τὴν παραίνεσιν,\r\n[B] ἀλλ᾽ ἔργῳ διδάσκων ὅ,τι βούλεται συμβολικῶς διὰ δυοῖν ὀνομάτοιν,\r\nΠαραχάραξον εἰπὼν τὸ νόμισμα· τὸ γάρ Γνῶθι σαυτὸν οὐκ ἐκείνῳ μόνον,(40)\r\nἀλλὰ καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις ἔφη καὶ λέγει, πρόκειται γὰρ οἶμαι τοῦ τεμένους.\r\nηὑρήκαμεν δὴ τὸν ἀρχηγέτην τῆς φιλοσοφίας, ὥς που καὶ ὁ δαιμόνιός φησιν\r\nἸάμβλιχος, ἀλλὰ καὶ τοὺς κορυφαίους ἐν αὐτῇ, Ἀντισθένη καὶ Διογένη καὶ\r\nΚράτητα, οἷς τοῦ βίου σκοπὸς ἦν καὶ τέλος αὑτοὺς οἶμαι γνῶναι καὶ τῶν\r\nκενῶν ὑπεριδεῖν δοξῶν, ἀληθείας δέ, ἣ πάντων μὲν ἀγαθῶν θεοῖς, πάντων δὲ\r\nἀνθρώποις ἡγεῖται, ὅλῃ, [C] φασίν, ἐπιδράξασθαι τῇ διανοίᾳ, ἧς οἶμαι καὶ\r\nΠλάτων καὶ Πυθαγόρας καὶ Σωκράτης οἵ τε ἐκ τοῦ Περιπάτου καὶ Ζήνων ἕνεκα\r\nπάντα ὑπέμειναν πόνον, αὑτούς τε ἐθέλοντες γνῶναι καὶ μὴ κεναῖς ἕπεσθαι\r\nδόξαις, ἀλλὰ τὴν ἐν τοῖς οὖσιν ἀλήθειαν ἀνιχνεῦσαι.\r\n\r\n(Now the founder of this philosophy to whom we are to attribute it, in the\r\nfirst instance, is not easy to discover, even though some think that the\r\ntitle belongs to Antisthenes and Diogenes. At least the saying of\r\nOenomaus(41) seems to be not without good grounds: “The Cynic philosophy\r\nis neither Antisthenism nor Diogenism.” Moreover the better sort of Cynics\r\nassert that in addition to the other blessings bestowed on us by mighty\r\nHeracles, it was he who bequeathed to mankind the noblest example of this\r\nmode of life.(42) But for my part, while I desire to speak with due\r\nreverence of the gods and of those who have attained to their functions, I\r\nstill believe that even before Heracles, not only among the Greeks but\r\namong the barbarians also, there were men who practised this philosophy.\r\nFor it seems to be in some ways a universal philosophy, and the most\r\nnatural, and to demand no special study whatsoever. But it is enough\r\nsimply to choose the honourable by desiring virtue and avoiding evil; and\r\nso there is no need to turn over countless books. For as the saying goes,\r\n“Much learning does not teach men to have understanding.”(43) Nor is it\r\nnecessary to subject oneself to any part of such a discipline as they must\r\nundergo who enter other philosophic sects. Nay it is enough merely to\r\nhearken to the Pythian god when he enjoins these two precepts, “Know\r\nThyself,” and “Falsify the common currency.”(44) Hence it becomes evident\r\nto us that the founder of this philosophy is he who, I believe, is the\r\ncause of all the blessings that the Greeks enjoy, the universal leader,\r\nlaw‐giver and king of Hellas, I mean the god of Delphi.(45) And since it\r\nwas not permitted that he should be in ignorance of aught, the peculiar\r\nfitness of Diogenes did not escape his notice. And he made him incline to\r\nthat philosophy, not by urging his commands in words alone, as he does for\r\nother men, but in very deed he instructed him symbolically as to what he\r\nwilled, in two words, when he said, “Falsify the common currency.” For\r\n“Know Thyself” he addressed not only to Diogenes, but to other men also\r\nand still does: for it stands there engraved in front of his shrine. And\r\nso we have at last discovered the founder of this philosophy, even as the\r\ndivine Iamblichus also declares, yes, and we have discovered its leading\r\nmen as well, namely Antisthenes and Diogenes and Crates;(46) the aim and\r\nend of whose lives was, I think, to know themselves, to despise vain\r\nopinions, and to lay hold of truth with their whole understanding; for\r\ntruth, alike for gods and men, is the beginning of every good thing;(47)\r\nand it was, I think, for her sake that Plato and Pythagoras and Socrates\r\nand the Peripatetic philosophers and Zeno spared no pains, because they\r\nwished to know themselves, and not to follow vain opinions but to track\r\ndown truth among all things that are.)\r\n\r\nΦέρε οὖν, ἐπειδὴ πέφηνεν οὐκ ἄλλο μὲν ἐπιτηδεύσας Πλάτων, ἕτερον δὲ\r\nΔιογένης, ἓν δέ τι καὶ ταὐτόν· εἰ γοῦν ἔροιτό τις τὸν σοφὸν Πλάτωνα “τὸ\r\nΓνῶθι σαυτὸν πόσου νενόμικας ἄξιον;” εὖ οἶδα ὅτι τοῦ παντὸς ἂν φήσειε, [D]\r\nκαὶ λέγει δὲ ἐν Ἀλκιβιάδῃ· δεῦρο δὴ τὸ μετὰ τοῦτο φράσον ἡμῖν, ὦ δαιμόνιε\r\nΠλάτων καὶ θεῶν ἔκγονε “Τίνα τρόπον χρὴ πρὸς τὰς τῶν πολλῶν διακεῖσθαι\r\nδόξας,” ταὐτά τε ἐρεῖ καὶ ἔτι πρὸς τούτοις ὅλον ἡμῖν ἐπιτάξει διαρρήδην\r\nἀναγνῶναι τὸν Κρίτωνα διάλογον, οὗ φαίνεται παραινῶν Σωκράτης μηδὲν\r\nφροντίζειν ἡμᾶς τῶν τοιούτων· φησὶ γοῦν· “Ἀλλὰ τί ἡμῖν, ὦ μακάριε Κρίτων,\r\n[189] οὕτω τῆς τῶν πολλῶν δόξης μέλει;” εἶτα ἡμεῖς τούτων ὑπεριδόντες\r\nἀποτειχίζειν ἁπλῶς οὑτωσὶ καὶ ἀποσπᾶν ἄνδρας ἀλλήλων ἐθέλομεν, οὗς ὁ τῆς\r\nἀληθείας συνήγαγεν ἔρως ἥ τε τῆς δόξης ὑπεροψία καὶ ἡ πρὸς τὸν ζῆλον τῆς\r\nἀρετῆς ξύμπνοια; εἰ δὲ Πλάτωνι μὲν ἔδοξε καὶ διὰ τῶν λόγων αὐτὰ\r\nἐργάζεσθαι, Διογένει δὲ ἀπέχρη τὰ ἔργα, διὰ τοῦτο ἄξιός ἐστιν ὑφ᾽ ὑμῶν\r\nἀκούειν κακῶς; ὅρα δὲ μὴ καὶ τοῦτο αὐτὸ τῷ παντὶ κρεῖττόν ἐστιν, ἐπεὶ καὶ\r\nΠλάτων ἐξομνύμενος φαίνεται τὰ ξυγγράμματα.

I am very sure that he would answer that it is worth\r\neverything, and indeed he says so in the Alcibiades.(48) Come then tell us\r\nnext, divine Plato, scion of the gods, how one ought to be disposed\r\ntowards the opinions of the many? He will give the same answer, and\r\nmoreover he will expressly enjoin on us to read his dialogue the\r\nCrito,(49) where Socrates is shown warning us not to take heed of such\r\nthings. At any rate what he says is: “But why, my dear good Crito, are we\r\nso concerned about the opinion of the multitude?” And now are we to ignore\r\nall this evidence, and without further question fence off from one another\r\nand force apart men whom the passion for truth, the scorn of opinion, and\r\nunanimity in zeal for virtue have joined together? And if Plato chose to\r\nachieve his aim through words, whereas for Diogenes deeds sufficed, does\r\nthe latter on that account deserve to be criticised by you? Nay, consider\r\nwhether that same method of his be not in every respect superior; since we\r\nsee that Plato for himself forswore written compositions. “For” he\r\nsays,(50) “there are no writings by Plato nor ever will be, and what now\r\npass current as his are the work of Socrates, the ever fair and ever\r\nyoung.” Why then should we not from the practice of Diogenes study the\r\ncharacter of the Cynic philosophy?)\r\n\r\nΟὐκοῦν ἐπειδὴ σώματος μέρη μέν ἐστιν, οἷον ὀφθαλμοί, πόδες, χεῖρες, ἄλλα\r\nδὲ ἐπισυμβαίνει, τρίχες, ὄνυχες, ῥύπος, τοιούτων περιττωμάτων γένος, ὧν\r\nὔνευ σῶμα ἀνθρώπινον ἀμήχανον εἶναι, [C] πότερον οὐ γελοῖός ἐστιν ὁ μέρη\r\nνομίσας ὄνυχας ἢ τρίχας ἢ ῥύπον καὶ τὰ δυσώδη τῶν περιττωμάτων, ἀλλ᾽ οὐ τὰ\r\nτιμιώτατα καὶ σπουδαῖα, πρῶτον μὲν τὰ αἰσθητήρια καὶ τούτων αὐτῶν ἅττα\r\nσυνέσεως ἡμῖν ἐστι μᾶλλον αἴτια, οἷον ὀφθαλμούς, ἀκοάς; ὑπουργεῖ γὰρ ταῦτα\r\nπρὸς φρόνησιν εἴτε ἐγκατορωρυγμένῃ τῇ ψυχῇ, ὡς ἂν θᾶττον καθαρθεῖσα\r\nδύναιτο τῇ καθαρᾷ χρῆσθαι(51) καὶ ἀκινήτῳ τοῦ φρονεῖν δυνάμει, εἴτε ὥσπερ\r\nτινὲς οἴονται, καθάπερ δι᾽ ὀχετῶν τοιούτων εἰσφερούσης τῆς ψυχῆς.

Then\r\nis it not absurd for a man to take into account such parts, I mean hair or\r\nnails or ordure or such unpleasant accessories, rather than those parts\r\nthat are most precious and important, in the first place, for instance,\r\nthe organs of perception, and among these more especially the instruments\r\nwhereby we apprehend, namely the eyes and ears? For these aid the soul to\r\nthink intelligently, whether it be buried deep in the body and they enable\r\nit to purify itself more readily and to use its pure and steadfast faculty\r\nof thought, or whether, as some think, it is through them that the soul\r\nenters in as though by channels.(54) For, as we are told, by collecting\r\nindividual perceptions and linking them through the memory she brings\r\nforth the sciences. And for my own part, I think that if there were not\r\nsomething of this sort, either incomplete in itself or perfect but\r\nhindered by other things many and various, which brings about our\r\napprehension of externals, it would not even be possible for us to\r\napprehend the objects of sense‐perception. But this line of argument has\r\nlittle to do with the present question.)\r\n\r\n[190] Διόπερ ἐπανακτέον ἐπὶ τὰ μέρη τῆς φιλοσοφίας τῆς κυνικῆς. φαίνονται\r\nμὲν δὴ καὶ οὗτοι διμερῆ τὴν φιλοσοφίαν νομίσαντες ὥσπερ ὁ Ἀριστοτέλης καὶ\r\nΠλάτων, θεωρηματικήν τε καὶ πρακτικὴν, αὐτὸ τοῦτο(55) συνέντες δηλονότι\r\nκαὶ νοήσαντες, ὡς οἰκεῖόν ἐστιν ἔνθρωπος φύσει πράξει καὶ ἐπιστήμῃ. εἰ δὲ\r\nτῆς φυσικῆς τὴν θεωρίαν(56) ἐξέκλιναν, οὐδὲν τοῦτο πρὸς τὸν λόγον. ἐπεὶ\r\nκαὶ Σωκράτης καὶ πλείονες ἄλλοι θεωρίᾳ μὲν φαίνονται χρησάμενοι πολλῇ,\r\nταύτῃ δὲ οὐκ ἄλλου χάριν, ἀλλὰ τῆς πράξεως· ἐπεὶ καὶ τὸ ἑαυτὸν γνῶναι\r\nτοῦτο ἐνόμισαν, [B] τὸ μαθεῖν ἀκριβῶς, τί μὲν ἐποδοτέον ψυχῇ, τί δὲ\r\nσώματι· ἀπέδοσαν δὲ(57) εἰκότως ἡγεμονίαν μὲν τῇ ψυχῇ, ὑπηρεσίαν δὲ τῷ\r\nσώματι. φαίνονται δὴ οὖν ἀρετὴν ἐπιτηδεύσαντες, ἐγκράτειαν, ἀτυφίαν,\r\nἐλευθερίαν, ἔξω γενόμενοι παντὸς φθόνου, δειλίας, δεισιδαιμονίας. ἀλλ᾽ οὐχ\r\nἡμεῖς ταῦτα ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν διανοούμεθα, παίζειν δὲ αὐτοὺς καὶ κυβεύειν περὶ\r\nτοῖς φιλτάτοις ὑπολαμβάνομεν, οὕτως ὑπεριδόντας [C] τοῦ σώματος, ὡς ὁ\r\nΣωκράτης ἔφη λέγων ὀρθῶς μελέτην εἶναι θανάτου τὴν φιλοσοφίαν. τοῦτο\r\nἐκεῖνοι καθ᾽ ἑκάστην ἡμέραν ἐπιτηδεύοντες οὐ ζηλωτοὶ μᾶλλον ἡμῖν, ἄθλιοι\r\nδέ τινες καὶ παντελῶς ἀνόητοι δοκοῦσιν·(58) ἀνθ᾽ ὅτου δὲ(59) τοὺς πόνους\r\nὑπέμειναν τούτους;(60) οὐχ ὡς αὐτὸς εἶπας, κενοδοξίας ἕνεκα. καὶ γὰρ(61)\r\nπῶς ὑπὸ τῶν ἄλλων ἐπῃνοῦντο ὠμὰ προσφερόμενοι σαρκία; καίτοι οὐδὲ αὐτὸς\r\nἐπαινέτης εἶ.

[191] οὕτως ὁ κλεινὸς ἥρως ἔργῳ\r\nκατεπλήξατο γελοίῳ μὲν ἀνθρώποις τοιούτοις,\r\n\r\n(Accordingly we must go back to the divisions of the Cynic philosophy. For\r\nthe Cynics also seem to have thought that there were two branches of\r\nphilosophy, as did Aristotle and Plato, namely speculative and practical,\r\nevidently because they had observed and understood that man is by nature\r\nsuited both to action and to the pursuit of knowledge. And though they\r\navoided the study of natural philosophy, that does not affect the\r\nargument. For Socrates and many others also, as we know, devoted\r\nthemselves to speculation, but it was solely for practical ends. For they\r\nthought that even self‐knowledge meant learning precisely what must be\r\nassigned to the soul, and what to the body. And to the soul they naturally\r\nassigned supremacy, and to the body subjection. This seems to be the\r\nreason why they practised virtue, self‐control, modesty and freedom, and\r\nwhy they shunned all forms of envy, cowardice and superstition. But this,\r\nyou will say, is not the view that we hold about them, for we are to think\r\nthat they were not in earnest, and that they hazarded what is most\r\nprecious(62) in thus despising the body; as Socrates did when he declared,\r\nand rightly, that philosophy is a preparation for death.(63) And since\r\nthis was the aim that the Cynics pursued daily, we need not emulate them\r\nany more than the others, but we are to think them miserable beings and\r\naltogether foolish. But why was it that they endured those hardships?\r\nSurely not from ostentation, as you declared. For how could they win\r\napplause from other men by eating raw meat? Certainly you yourself do not\r\napplaud them for this. At any rate, when you imitate one of those Cynics\r\nby carrying a staff and wearing your hair long, as it is shown in their\r\npictures, do you think that you thereby gain a reputation with the crowd,\r\nthough you do not yourself think those habits worthy of admiration? One or\r\ntwo, indeed, used to applaud him in his own day, but more than ten times\r\nten thousand had their stomachs turned by nausea and loathing, and went\r\nfasting until their attendants revived them with perfumes and myrrh and\r\ncakes. So greatly did that renowned hero shock them by an act which seems\r\nabsurd to men)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Οἷοι νῦν βροτοί εἰσιν,\r\n\r\n    (“of such sort as mortals now are,”(64))\r\n\r\n\r\nοὐκ ἀγεννεῖ δέ, μὰ τοὺς θεούς, εἴ τις αὐτὸ κατὰ τὴν Διογένους ἐξηγήσαιτο\r\nσύνεσιν. ὅπερ γὰρ ὁ Σωκράτης ὑπὲρ αὑτοῦ φησιν, ὅτι τῷ θεῷ νομίζων λατρείαν\r\nἐκτελεῖν ἐν τῷ τὸν δοθέντα χρησμὸν ὑπὲρ αὐτοῦ κατὰ πάντα σκοπῶν ἐξετάζειν\r\nτὸν ἐλεγκτικὸν ἠσπάσατο βίον, τοῦτο καὶ Διογένης οἶμαι συνειδὼς ἑαυτῷ,\r\nπυθόχρηστον οὖσαν τὴν φιλοσοφίαν, ἔργοις ᾤετο δεῖν ἐξελέγχειν πάντα καὶ μὴ\r\nδόξαις ἄλλων, τυχὸν μὲν ἀληθέσι, τυχὸν δὲ ψευδέσι προσπεπονθέναι. οὔκουν\r\nοὐδὲ εἴ τι Πυθαγόρας ἔφη, οὐδὲ εἴ τις ἄλλος τῷ Πυθαγόρᾳ παραπλήσιος,\r\nἀξιόπιστος ἐδόκει τῷ Διογένει. τὸν γὰρ θεόν, ἀνθρώπων δὲ(65) οὐδένα τῆς\r\nφιλοσοφίας ἀρχηγὸν ἐπεποίητο.

For just as Socrates said of\r\nhimself that he embraced the life of cross‐examining because he believed\r\nthat he could perform his service to the god only by examining in all its\r\nbearings the meaning of the oracle that had been uttered concerning him,\r\nso I think Diogenes also, because he was convinced that philosophy was\r\nordained by the Pythian oracle, believed that he ought to test everything\r\nby facts and not be influenced by the opinions of others, which may be\r\ntrue and may be false. Accordingly Diogenes did not think that every\r\nstatement of Pythagoras, or any man like Pythagoras, was necessarily true.\r\nFor he held that God and no human being is the founder of philosophy. And\r\npray what, you will say, has this to do with the eating of octopus? I will\r\ntell you.)\r\n\r\nΤὴν σαρκοφαγίαν οἱ μὲν ἀνθρώποις ὑπολαμβάνουσι κατὰ φύσιν, οἱ δὲ ἥκιστα\r\nτοῦτο ἐργάζεσθαι προσήκειν ἀνθρώπῳ διανοοῦνται, καὶ πολὺς ὁ περὶ τούτου\r\nἀνάλωται(66) λόγος. ἐθέλοντι οὖν σοι μὴ ῥᾳθυμεῖν ἑσμοὶ περὶ τοῦ τοιούτου\r\nβίβλων φανήσονται. τούτους Διογένης ἐξελέγχειν ᾤετο δεῖν. διενοήθη γοῦν\r\nοὕτως· εἰ μὲν ἀπραγματεύτως ἐσθίων τις σάρκας, ὥσπερ οἶμαι τῶν ἄλλων\r\nἕκαστον θηρίων, [D] οἷς τοῦτο ἔνειμεν ἡ φύσις, ἀβλαβῶς αὐτὸ καὶ ἀνεπαχθῶς,\r\nμᾶλλον δὲ καὶ μετὰ τῆς τοῦ σώματος ὠφελείας ἐργάζοιτο, κατὰ φύσιν εἶναι\r\nπάντως τὴν σαρκοφαγίαν ὑπέλαβεν· εἰ δέ τις ἐντεῦθεν γένοιτο βλάβη, οὐχὶ\r\nτοῦτο ἀνθρώπου τὸ ἔργον ἴσως ἐνόμισεν, ἀλλ᾽ ἀφεκτέον εἶναι κατὰ κράτος\r\nαὐτοῦ. εἷς μὲν οὖν ἂν εἴη τοιοῦτος ὑπὲρ τοῦ πράγματος ἴσως βιαιότερος\r\nλόγος, ἕτερος δὲ οἰκειότερος τῷ Κυνισμῷ, εἰ περὶ τοῦ τέλους αὐτοῦ πρότερον\r\nἔτι σαφέστερον διέλθοιμι.\r\n\r\n(To eat meat some regard as natural to man, while others think that to\r\nfollow this practice is not at all appropriate for man, and this question\r\nhas been much debated. And if you are willing to make the effort, you can\r\nsee with your own eyes swarms of books on the subject. These Diogenes\r\nthought it his duty to refute. At any rate his own view was as follows. If\r\none can eat meat without taking too much trouble to prepare it, as can all\r\nother animals to whom nature has assigned this diet, and can do it without\r\nharm or discomfort, or rather with actual benefit to the body, then he\r\nthought that eating meat is entirely in accordance with nature. But if\r\nharm came of it, then he apparently thought that the practice is not\r\nappropriate for man, and that he must abstain from it by all means. Here\r\nthen you have a theory on this question, though perhaps it is too far‐\r\nfetched: but here is another more akin to Cynicism, only I must first\r\ndescribe more clearly the end and aim of that philosophy.)\r\n\r\n[192] Ἀπάθειαν γὰρ ποιοῦνται τὸ τέλος· τοῦτο δὲ ἴσον ἐστὶ τῷ θεὸν\r\nγενέσθαι. αἰσθανόμενος οὖν ἴσως αὑτοῦ Διογένης ἐν μὲν τοῖς ἄλλοις ἅπασιν\r\nἀπαθοῦς, ὑπὸ δὲ τῆς τοιαύτης ἐδωδῆς μόνον θραττομένου καὶ ναυτιῶντος καὶ\r\nδόξῃ κενῇ μᾶλλον(67) ἢ λόγῳ δεδουλωμένου· σάρκες γάρ εἴσιν οὐδὲν ἧττον,\r\nκἂν μυριάκις αὐτὰς ἑψήσῃ, κἂν ὑποτρίμμασι μυρίοις τις αὐτὰς καρυκεύσῃ· καὶ\r\nταύτης αὑτὸν ἀφελέσθαι καὶ καταστῆσαι παντάπασιν ἐξάντη τῆς δειλίας ᾠήθη\r\nχρῆναι.

Now perhaps Diogenes observed that in the\r\ncase of all other foods he himself had no particular sensations, and that\r\nonly raw meat gave him indigestion and nausea, and took this for a proof\r\nthat he was enslaved to vain opinion rather than reason; for flesh is none\r\nthe less flesh, even though you cook it any number of times or season it\r\nwith any number of sauces. This, I say, was why he thought he ought to rid\r\nand free himself altogether of this cowardice; for you may be sure that\r\nthis sort of thing is cowardice. And in the name of the Law‐Giving\r\ngoddess,(69) tell me why if we used cooked meats we do not eat them in\r\ntheir natural state also? You can give me no other answer than that this\r\nhas become a custom and a habit with us. For surely we cannot say that\r\nbefore meat is cooked it is disgusting and that by being cooked it becomes\r\npurer than it was by nature. What then was it right for him to do who had\r\nbeen appointed by God like a general in command to do away with the common\r\ncurrency and to judge all questions by the criterion of reason and truth?\r\nOught he to have shut his eyes and been so far fettered by this general\r\nopinion as to believe that flesh by being cooked becomes pure and fit for\r\nfood, but that when it has not been acted upon by fire it is somehow\r\nabominable and loathsome? Is this the sort of memory you have? Is this\r\nyour zeal for truth? For though you so severely criticised Diogenes the\r\nvain‐glorious, as you call him—though I call him the most zealous servant\r\nand vassal of the Pythian god—for eating octopus, you yourself have\r\ndevoured endless pickled food,)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ἰχθῦς ὄρνιθάς τε φίλας θ᾽ ὅτι χεῖρας ἵκοιτο,\r\n\r\n    (“Fish and birds and whatever else might come to hand.”(70))\r\n\r\n\r\nΑἰγύπτιός γε ὤν, οὐ τῶν ἱερέων, ἀλλὰ τῶν παμφάγων, οἷς πάντα ἐσθίειν νόμος\r\nὡς λάχανα χόρτου· γνωρίζεις οἶμαι [193] τῶν Γαλιλαίων τὰ ῥήματα. μικροῦ με\r\nπαρῆλθεν εἰπεῖν, ὅτι καὶ πάντες ἄνθρωποι πλησίον οἰκοῦντες θαλάττης, ἤδη\r\nδέ τινες καὶ τῶν πόρρω, οὐδὲ θερμήναντες καταρροφοῦσιν ἐχίνους, ὄστρεα καὶ\r\nπάντα ἁπλῶς τὰ τοιαῦτα· εἶτα ἐκείνους μὲν ὑπολαμβάνεις ζηλωτούς, ἄθλιον δὲ\r\nκαὶ βδελυρὸν ἡλῇ Διογένη, καὶ οὐκ ἐννοεῖς, ὡς οὐδὲν μᾶλλον ταῦτα ἐκείνων\r\nἐστὶ σαρκία· πλὴν ἴσως ταῦτα ἐκείνων διαφέρει τῷ τὰ μὲν εἶναι μαλθακά, τὰ\r\nδὲ σκληρότερα. ἄναιμος γοῦν ἐστι καὶ πολύπους [B] ὥσπερ ἐκεῖνα, ἔμψυχα δέ\r\nἐστι καὶ τὰ ὀστρακόδερμα καθάπερ καὶ οὗτος· ἥδεται γοῦν καὶ λυπεῖται, ὃ\r\nτῶν ἐμψύχων μάλιστά ἐστιν ἴδιον. ἐνοχλείτω δὲ μηδὲν ἡμᾶς ἡ Πλατωνικὴ τανῦν\r\nδόξα ἔμψυχα ὑπολαμβάνουσα καὶ τὰ φυτά. ἀλλ᾽ ὅτι μὲν οὔτι ἄλογον(71) οὐδὲ\r\nπαράνομον οὐδὲ ἀσύνηθες ὑμῖν ὁ γενναῖος εἰργάσατο Διογένης, εἰ μὴ τῷ\r\nσκληροτέρῳ καὶ μαλακωτέρῳ, ἡδονῇ τε λαιμοῦ καὶ ἀηδίᾳ τὰ τοιαῦτά τις\r\nἐξετάζοι, πρόδηλον οἶμαι τοῖς ὁπωσοῦν ἕπεσθαι λόγῳ δυναμένοις. οὐκ ἄρα τὴν\r\nὠμοφαγίαν βδελύττεσθε οἱ τὰ παραπλήσια δρῶντες, [C] οὐκ ἐπὶ τῶν ἀναίμων\r\nμόνον ζῴων, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν αἷμα ἐχόντων. καὶ τούτῳ δὲ ἴσως διαφέρεσθε\r\nπρὸς ἐκεῖνον, ὅτι ὁ μὲν ἁπλῶς ταῦτα καὶ κατὰ φύσιν ᾠήθη χρῆναι\r\nπροσφέρεσθαι, ἁλσὶ δὲ ὑμεῖς καὶ πολλοῖς ἄλλοις ἀρτύσαντες ἡδονῆς ἕνεκα,\r\nτὴν φύσιν ὅπως βιάσησθε. καὶ δὴ τοῦτο μὲν ἐπὶ τοσοῦτον ἀπόχρη.\r\n\r\n(For you are an Egyptian, though not of the priestly caste, but of the\r\nomnivorous type whose habit it is to eat everything “even as the green\r\nherb.”(72) You recognise, I suppose, the words of the Galilaeans. I almost\r\nomitted to say that all men who live near the sea, and even some who live\r\nat a distance from it, swallow down sea‐urchins, oysters and in general\r\neverything of the kind without even heating them. And then you think they\r\nare enviable, whereas you regard Diogenes as contemptible and disgusting,\r\nand you do not perceive that those shell‐fish are flesh just as much as\r\nwhat he ate? Except perhaps that differ in so far as the octopus is soft\r\nand shell‐fish are harder. At any rate the octopus is bloodless, like\r\nhard‐shelled fish, but the latter too are animate things like the octopus.\r\nAt least they feel pleasure and pain, which is the peculiar characteristic\r\nof animate things. And here we must not be put out by Plato’s theory(73)\r\nthat plants also are animated by soul. But it is now, I think, evident to\r\nthose who are in any way able to follow an argument, that what the\r\nexcellent Diogenes did was not out of the way or irregular or contrary to\r\nour habits, that is if we do not in such cases apply the criterion of\r\nhardness and softness, but judge rather by the pleasure or distaste of the\r\npalate. And so it is not after all the eating of raw food that disgusts\r\nyou, since you do the like, not only in the case of bloodless animals but\r\nalso of those that have blood. But perhaps there is also this difference\r\nbetween you and Diogenes, that he thought he ought to eat such food just\r\nas it was and in the natural state, whereas you think you must first\r\nprepare it with salt and many other things to make it agreeable and so do\r\nviolence to nature. I have now said enough on this subject.)\r\n\r\n[D] Τῆς Κυνικῆς δὲ φιλοσοφίας σκοπὸς μέν ἐστι καὶ τέλος, ὥσπερ δὴ καὶ\r\nπάσης φιλοσοφίας, τὸ εὐδαιμονεῖν, τὸ δὲ εὐδαιμονεῖν ἐν τῷ ζῆν κατὰ φύσιν,\r\nἀλλὰ μὴ πρὸς τὰς τῶν πολλῶν δόξας. ἐπεὶ καὶ τοῖς φυτοῖς εὖ πράττειν\r\nσυμβαίνει καὶ μέντοι καὶ ζῴοις πᾶσιν, ὅταν τοῦ κατὰ φύσιν ἕκαστον\r\nἀνεμποδίστως τυγχάνῃ τέλους· ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν τοῖς θεοῖς τοῦτό ἐστιν\r\nεὐδαιμονίας ὅρος, τὸ ἔχειν αὐτοὺς ὥσπερ πεφύκασι καὶ ἑαυτῶν εἶναι.

For plants\r\ntoo are considered to do well, and indeed all animals also, when without\r\nhindrance each attains the end designed for it by nature. Nay, even among\r\nthe gods this is the definition of happiness, that their state should be\r\naccording to their nature, and that they should be independent. And so too\r\nin the case of human beings we must not be busy about happiness as if it\r\nwere hidden away outside ourselves. Neither the eagle nor the plane tree\r\nnor anything else that has life, whether plant or animal, vainly troubles\r\nitself about wings or leaves of gold or that its shoots may be of silver\r\nor its stings and spurs of iron, or rather of adamant; but where nature in\r\nthe beginning has adorned them with such things, they consider that, if\r\nonly they are strong and serviceable for speed or defence, they themselves\r\nare fortunate and well provided. Then is it not absurd when a human being\r\ntries to find happiness somewhere outside himself, and thinks that wealth\r\nand birth and the influence of friends, and generally speaking everything\r\nof that sort is of the utmost importance? If however nature had bestowed\r\non us only what she has bestowed on other animals, I mean the possession\r\nof bodies and souls like theirs, so that we need concern ourselves with\r\nnothing beyond, then it would suffice for us, as for all other animals, to\r\ncontent ourselves with physical advantages, and to pursue happiness within\r\nthis field. But in us has been implanted a soul that in no way resembles\r\nother animals; and whether it be different in essence, or not different in\r\nessence but superior in its activity only, just as, I suppose, pure gold\r\nis superior to gold alloyed with sand,—for some people hold this theory to\r\nbe true of the soul,—at any rate we surely know that we are more\r\nintelligent than other animals. For according to the myth in the\r\nProtagoras,(74) nature dealt with them very generously and bountifully,\r\nlike a mother, but to compensate for all this, mind was bestowed on us by\r\nZeus. Therefore in our minds, in the best and noblest part of us, we must\r\nsay that happiness resides.)\r\n\r\nΣκόπει δή, ταύτης εἰ μὴ μάλιστα τῆς προαιρέσεως ἦν Διογένης, ὃς τὸ μὲν\r\nσῶμα τοῖς πόνοις ἀνέδην παρεῖχεν, ἵνα αὐτὸ τῆς φύσεως ῥωμαλεώτερον\r\nκαταστήσῃ πράττειν [195] δὲ ἠξίου μόνον ὁπόσα ἂν φανῇ τῷ λόγῳ πρακτέα,\r\nτοὺς δὲ ἐκ τοῦ σώματος ἐμπίπτοντας τῇ ψυχῇ θορύβους, οἷα πολλάκις ἡμᾶς\r\nἀναγκάζει τουτὶ τὸ περικείμενον αὐτοῦ χάριν πολυπραγμονεῖν, οὐδὲ ἐν μέρει\r\nπροσίετο. ὑπὸ δὲ ταύτης τῆς ἀσκήσεως ὁ ἀνὴρ οὕτω μὲν ἔσχεν ἀνδρεῖον τὸ\r\nσῶμα ὡς οὐδεὶς οἶμαι τῶν τοὺς [B] στεφανίτας ἀγωνισαμένων, οὕτω δὲ διετέθη\r\nτὴν ψυχήν, ὥστε εὐδαιμονεῖν, ὥστε βασιλεύειν οὐδὲν ἔλαττον, εἰ μὴ καὶ\r\nπλέον, ὡς οἱ τότε εἰώθεσαν λέγειν Ἕλληνες, τοῦ μεγάλου βασιλέως, τὸν\r\nΠέρσην λέγοντες. ἆρά σοι μικρὰ φαίνεται ἀνὴρ\r\n\r\n(Now consider whether Diogenes did not above all other men profess this\r\nbelief, since he freely exposed his body to hardships so that he might\r\nmake it stronger than it was by nature. He allowed himself to act only as\r\nthe light of reason shows us that we ought to act; and the perturbations\r\nthat attack the soul and are derived from the body, to which this envelope\r\nof ours often constrains us for its sake to pay too much attention, he did\r\nnot take into account at all. Thus by means of this discipline the man\r\nmade his body more vigorous, I believe, than that of any who have\r\ncontended for the prize of a crown in the games: and his soul was so\r\ndisposed that he was happy and a king no less if not even more than the\r\nGreat King, as the Greeks used to call him in those days, by which they\r\nmeant the king of Persia.

You think, do you not, that for\r\nmankind freedom is the beginning of all good things,(77) I mean of course\r\nwhat people are always calling good? How can you deny it? For property,\r\nmoney, birth, physical strength, beauty and in a word everything of the\r\nsort when divorced from freedom are surely blessings that belong, not to\r\nhim who merely seems to enjoy them, but to him who is that man’s master?\r\nWhom then are we to regard as a slave? Shall it be him whom we buy for so\r\nmany silver drachmas, for two minae or for ten staters(78) of gold?\r\nProbably you will say that such a man is truly a slave. And why? Is it\r\nbecause we have paid down money for him to the seller? But in that case\r\nthe prisoners of war whom we ransom would be slaves. And yet the law on\r\nthe one hand grants these their freedom when they have come safe home, and\r\nwe on the other hand ransom them not that they may become slaves, but that\r\nthey may be free. Do you see then that in order to make a ransomed man a\r\nslave it is not enough to pay down a sum of money, but that man is truly a\r\nslave over whom another man has power to compel him to do whatever he\r\norders, and if he refuse, to punish him and in the words of the poet)\r\n\r\n\r\n    κακαῖς ὀδύνῃσι πελάζειν;\r\n\r\n    (“to inflict grievous pains upon him”?(79))\r\n\r\n\r\nὅρα δὴ τὸ μετὰ τοῦτο, [B] εἰ μὴ κύριοι πάντες ἡμῶν εἰσιν, οὓς ἀναγκαῖον\r\nἡμῖν θεραπεύειν, ἵνα μηδὲν ἀλγῶμεν μηδὲ λυπώμεθα κολαζόμενοι παρ᾽ αὐτῶν. ἢ\r\nτοῦτο οἴει κόλασιν μόνον, εἴ τις ἐπανατεινόμενος τὴν βακτηρίαν καθίκοιτο\r\nτοῦ οἰκέτου; καίτοι γε τοιοῦτον οὐδὲ οἱ τραχύτατοι τῶν δεσποτῶν ἐπὶ πάντων\r\nποιοῦσι τῶν οἰκετῶν, ἀλλὰ καὶ λόγος ἀρκεῖ πολλάκις καὶ ἀπειλή.

Yet not even the harshest masters do this in the case of all their\r\nslaves, but a word or a threat is often enough. Then never think, my\r\nfriend, that you are free while your belly rules you and the part below\r\nthe belly, since you will then have masters who can either furnish you the\r\nmeans of pleasure or deprive you of them; and even though you should prove\r\nyourself superior to these, so long as you are a slave to the opinions of\r\nthe many you have not yet approached freedom or tasted its nectar,)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Οὐ μὰ τὸν ἐν στέρνοισιν ἐμοῖς παραδόντα τετρακτύν.\r\n\r\n    (“I swear by him who set in my breast the mystery of the\r\n    Four!”(81))\r\n\r\n\r\nκαὶ οὐ τοῦτό φημι, [D] ὡς ἀπερυθριᾶσαι χρὴ πρὸς πάντας καὶ πράττειν. τὰ μὴ\r\nπρακτέα· ἀλλ᾽ ὧν ἀπεχόμεθα καὶ ὅσα πράττομεν, μὴ διὰ τὸ τοῖς πολλοῖς\r\nδοκεῖν σπουδαῖα πως(82) ἢ φαῦλα, διὰ τοῦτο πράττωμεν καὶ ἀπεχώμεθα, ἀλλ᾽\r\nὅτι τῷ λόγῳ καὶ τῷ ἐν ἡμῖν θεῷ, τοῦτ᾽ ἐστὶ τῷ νῷ, ταῦτά ἐστιν ἀπόρρητα.\r\nτοὺς μὲν οὖν πολλοὺς οὐδὲν κωλύει ταῖς κοιναῖς ἕπεσθαι δόξαις· ἄμεινον γὰρ\r\nτοῦτο τοῦ παντάπασιν ἀπερυθριᾶν· [197] ἔχουσι γὰρ ἅνθρωποι φύσει πρὸς\r\nἀλήθειαν οἰκείως· ἀνδρὶ δὲ ἤδη κατὰ νοῦν ζῶντι καὶ τοὺς ὀρθοὺς εὑρεῖν τε\r\nδυναμένῳ καὶ κρῖναι λόγους προσήκει τὸ παράπαν οὐδὲν ἕπεσθαι τοῖς\r\nνομιζομένοις ὑπὸ τῶν πολλῶν εὗ τε καὶ χεῖρον πράττεσθαι.\r\n\r\n(But I do not mean by this that we ought to be shameless before all men\r\nand to do what we ought not; but all that we refrain from and all that we\r\ndo let us not do or refrain from, merely because it seems to the multitude\r\nsomehow honourable or base, but because it is forbidden by reason and the\r\ngod within us, that is, the mind.(83) As for the multitude there is no\r\nreason why they should not follow common opinions, for that is better than\r\nthat they should be altogether shameless, and indeed mankind is\r\npredisposed to the truth by nature. But a man who has attained to a life\r\nin accordance with intelligence and is able to discover and estimate right\r\nreasons, ought on no account whatever to follow the views held by the many\r\nabout good and bad conduct.)\r\n\r\nΟὐκοῦν ἐπειδὴ τὸ μέν ἐστι τῆς ψυχῆς ἡμῶν θειότερον, ὃ δὴ νοῦν καὶ φρόνησίν\r\nφαμεν καὶ λόγον τὸν σιγώμενον, οὗ κήρυξ ἐστὶν ὁ διὰ τῆς φωνῆς οὑτοσὶ λόγος\r\nπροïὼν ἐξ ὀνομάτων καὶ ῥημάτων, ἕτερον δέ τι τούτῳ συνέζευκται ποικίλον\r\nκαὶ παντοδαπόν, [B] ὀργῇ καὶ ἐπιθυμίᾳ ξυμμιγές τι καὶ πολυκέφαλον θηρίον,\r\nοὐ πρότερον χρὴ πρὸς τὰς δόξας τῶν πολλῶν ἀτενῶς ὁρᾶν καὶ ἀδιατρέπτως,\r\nπρὶν ἂν τοῦτο δαμάσωμεν τὸ θηρίον καὶ πείσωμεν ὑπακοῦσαι τῷ παρ᾽ ἡμῖν θεῷ,\r\nμᾶλλον δὲ θείῳ. τοῦτο γὰρ πολλοὶ τοῦ Διογένους ζηλωταὶ ἐάσαντες(84)\r\nἐγένοντο παντορέκται καὶ μιαροὶ καὶ τῶν θηρίων οὐδὲ ἑνὸς κρείττους, ὅτι δὲ\r\nοὐκ ἐμὸς ὁ λόγος ἐστί, [C] πρῶτον ἔργον ἐρῶ σοι Διογένους, ἐφ᾽ ᾧ\r\nγελάσονται μὲν οἱ πολλοί, ἐμοὶ δὲ εἶναι δοκεῖ σεμνότατον. ἐπειδὴ γάρ τις\r\nτῶν νέων ἐν ὄχλῳ, παρόντος καὶ τοῦ Διογόνους, ἀπέπαρδεν, ἐπάταξεν ἐκεῖνος\r\nτῇ βακτηρίᾳ φάς· εἶτα, ὦ κάθαρμα, μηδὲν ἄξιον τοῦ δημοσίᾳ τὰ τοιταῦτα\r\nθαρσεῖν πράξας ἐντεῦθεν ἡμῖν ἄρχῃ δόξης καταφρονεῖν; οὕτως ᾤετο χρῆναι\r\nπρότερον ἡδονῆς καὶ θυμοῦ κρείττονα γενέσθαι, πρὶν(85) ἐπὶ τὸ τελειότατον\r\nἐλθεῖν τῶν παλαισμάτων, [D] ἀποδυσάμενον πρὸς τὰς τῶν πολλῶν δόξας αἳ\r\nμυρίων κακῶν αἴτιαι γίνονται τοῖς πολλοῖς.\r\n\r\n(Since therefore one part of our souls is more divine, which we call mind\r\nand intelligence and silent reason, whose herald is this speech of ours\r\nmade up of words and phrases and uttered through the voice; and since\r\nthere is yoked therewith another part of the soul which is changeful and\r\nmultiform, something composite of anger and appetite, a many‐headed\r\nmonster, we ought not to look steadily and unswervingly at the opinions of\r\nthe multitude until we have tamed this wild beast and persuaded it to obey\r\nthe god within us, or rather the divine part. For this it is that many\r\ndisciples of Diogenes have ignored, and hence have become rapacious and\r\ndepraved and no better than any one of the brute beasts. And to prove that\r\nthis is not my own theory,(86) first I will relate to you something that\r\nDiogenes did, which the many will ridicule but to me it seems most\r\ndignified. Once when, in a crowd of people among whom was Diogenes, a\r\ncertain youth made an unseemly noise, Diogenes struck him with his staff\r\nand said “And so, vile wretch, though you have done nothing that would\r\ngive you the right to take such liberties in public, you are beginning\r\nhere and before us to show your scorn of opinion?” So convinced was he\r\nthat a man ought to subdue pleasure and passion before he proceeds to the\r\nfinal encounter of all(87) and strips to wrestle with those opinions which\r\nto the multitude are the cause of evils innumerable.)\r\n\r\nΟὐκ οἶσθα ὅπως τοὺς μὲν νέους τῆς φιλοσοφίας ἀπάγουσιν, ἄλλα ἐπ᾽ ἄλλοις\r\nτῶν φιλοσόφων θρυλοῦντες; οἱ Πυθαγόρου καὶ Πλάτωνος καὶ Ἀριστοτέλους\r\nχορευταὶ γνήσιοι γόητες εἶναι λέγονται καὶ σοφισταὶ καὶ τετυφωμένοι καὶ\r\nφαρμακεῖς.

The genuine disciples of Pythagoras and Plato and\r\nAristotle are called sorcerers and sophists and conceited and quacks. If\r\nhere and there among the Cynics one is really virtuous he is regarded with\r\npity. For instance I remember that once my tutor said to me when he saw my\r\nfellow‐pupil Iphicles with his hair unkempt and his clothes in tatters on\r\nhis chest and wearing a wretched cloak in severe winter weather: “What\r\nevil genius can have plunged him into this sad state which makes not only\r\nhim pitiable but even more so his parents who reared him with care and\r\ngave him the best education they could! And now he goes about in this\r\ncondition, neglecting everything and no better than a beggar!” At the time\r\nI answered him with some pleasantry or other. But I assure you that the\r\nmultitude hold these views about genuine Cynics also. And that is not so\r\ndreadful, but do you see that they persuade them to love wealth, to hate\r\npoverty, to minister to the belly, to endure any toil for the body’s sake,\r\nto fatten that prison of the soul, to keep up an expensive table, never to\r\nsleep alone at night,(90) provided only that they do all this in the dark\r\nand are not found out? Is not this worse than Tartarus? Is it not better\r\nto sink beneath Charybdis and Cocytus or ten thousand fathoms deep in the\r\nearth(91) than to fall into a life like this, enslaved to lust and\r\nappetite, and not even to these simply and openly, like the beasts, but to\r\ntake pains so that when we act thus we may be hidden under cover of\r\ndarkness? And yet much better is it to refrain altogether from all this!\r\nAnd if that be difficult the rules of Diogenes and Crates on these matters\r\nare not to be despised: “Fasting quenches desire, and if you cannot fast,\r\nhang yourself.”(92) Do you not know that those great men lived as they did\r\nin order to introduce among men the way of plain living? \"For,\" says\r\nDiogenes, “it is not among men who live on bread that you will find\r\ntyrants, but among those who eat costly dinners.” Moreover Crates wrote a\r\nhymn to Plain Living:)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Χαῖρε, θεὰ δέσποινα, σοφῶν ἀνδρῶν ἀγάπημα,\r\n    Εὐτελίη, κλεινῆς ἔγγονε Σωφροσύνης.\r\n\r\n    (“Hail, goddess and Queen, darling of wise men, Plain Living,\r\n    child of glorious Temperance.”(93))\r\n\r\n\r\nἔστω δὴ μὴ κατὰ τὸν Οἰνόμαον ὁ κύων ἀναιδὴς μηδὲ ἀναίσχυντος μηδὲ\r\nὑπερόπτης πάντων ὁμοῦ θείων τε καὶ ἀνθρωπίνων, ἀλλὰ εὐλαβὴς μὲν τὰ πρὸς τὸ\r\nθεῖον, ὥσπερ Διογένης· [B] ἐπείσθη γοῦν ἐκεῖνος τῷ Πυθίῳ, καὶ οὐ\r\nμετεμέλησεν αὐτῷ πεισθέντι· εἰ δὲ, ὅτι μὴ προσῄει μηδὲ ἐθεράπευε τοὺς νεὼς\r\nμηδὲ τὰ ἀγάλματα μηδὲ τοὺς βωμούς, οἴεταί τις ἀθεότητος εἶναι σημεῖον, οὐκ\r\nὀρθῶς νομίζει· ἦν γὰρ οὐδὲν αὐτῷ τῶν τοιούτων, οὐ λιβανωτός, οὐ σπονδή,\r\nοὐκ ἀργύριον, ὅθεν αὐτὰ πρίαιτο. εἰ δὲ ἐνόει περὶ θεῶν ὀρθῶς, ἤρκει τοῦτο\r\nμόνον· αὐτῇ γὰρ αὐτοὺς ἐθεράπευε(94) τῇ ψυχῇ, διδοὺς οἶμαι τὰ τιμιώτατα\r\nτῶν ἑαυτοῦ, τὸ καθοσιῶσαι τὴν ἑαυτοῦ ψυχὴν διὰ τῶν ἐννοιῶν.

For he obeyed the Pythian oracle nor did he repent\r\nof his obedience. But if anyone supposes that because he did not visit the\r\ntemples or worship statues or altars this is a sign of impiety, he does\r\nnot think rightly. For Diogenes possessed nothing that is usually offered,\r\nincense or libations or money to buy them with. But if he held right\r\nopinions about the gods, that in itself was enough. For he worshipped them\r\nwith his whole soul, thus offering them as I think the most precious of\r\nhis possessions, the dedication of his soul through his thoughts. Let not\r\nthe Cynic be shameless, but led by reason let him first make subservient\r\nto himself the emotional part of his soul so that he may entirely do away\r\nwith it and not even be aware that he is superior to pleasures. For it is\r\nnobler to attain to this, I mean to complete ignorance whether one has any\r\nsuch emotions. And this comes to us only through training.

Nevertheless\r\nhe must not let himself drift with the current of the mob or touch vulgar\r\npleasure even with the tip of his finger, as the saying is, until he has\r\nsucceeded in trampling on it; then and not before he may permit himself to\r\ndip into that sort of thing if it come his way. For instance I am told\r\nthat bulls which are weaker than the rest separate themselves from the\r\nherd and pasture alone while they store up their strength in every part of\r\ntheir bodies by degrees, until they rejoin the herd in good condition, and\r\nthen they challenge its leaders to contend with them, in confidence that\r\nthey are more fit to take the lead. Therefore let him who wishes to be a\r\nCynic philosopher not adopt merely their long cloak or wallet or staff or\r\ntheir way of wearing the hair, as though he were like a man walking\r\nunshaved and illiterate in a village that lacked barbers’ shops and\r\nschools, but let him consider that reason rather than a staff and a\r\ncertain plan of life rather than a wallet are the mintmarks of the Cynic\r\nphilosophy. And freedom of speech he must not employ until he have first\r\nproved how much he is worth, as I believe was the case with Crates and\r\nDiogenes. For they were so far from bearing with a bad grace any threat of\r\nfortune, whether one call such threats caprice or wanton insult, that once\r\nwhen he had been captured by pirates Diogenes joked with them; as for\r\nCrates he gave his property to the state, and being physically deformed he\r\nmade fun of his own lame leg and hunched shoulders. But when his friends\r\ngave an entertainment he used to go, whether invited or not,(101) and\r\nwould reconcile his nearest friends if he learned that they had\r\nquarrelled. He used to reprove them not harshly but with a charming manner\r\nand not so as to seem to persecute those whom he wished to reform, but as\r\nthough he wished to be of use both to them and to the bystanders.)\r\n\r\nΚαὶ οὐ τοῦτο ῆν τὸ προηγούμενον αὐτοῖς τέλος· ἀλλ᾽, ὅπερ ἔφην, ἐσκόπουν\r\nὅπως αὐτοὶ μὲν εὐδαιμονήσουσιν,(102) ἔμελε δὲ αὐτοῖς τῶν ἄλλων τοσοῦτον\r\nὅσον ξυνίεσαν οἶμαι φύσει κοινωνικὸν καὶ πολιτικὸν ζῷον τὸν ἄνθρωπον\r\nεἶναι, καὶ τοὺς συμπολιτευομένους ὠφέλησαν οὐ τοῖς παραδείγμασι μόνον,\r\nἀλλὰ καὶ τοῖς λόγοις. [D] ὅστις οὖν ἂν ἐθέλῃ Κυνικὸς εἶναι καὶ σπουδαῖος\r\nἀνήρ, αὑτοῦ πρότερον ἐπιμεληθείς, ὥσπερ Διογένης καὶ Κράτης ἐξελαυνέτω μὲν\r\nτῆς ψυχῆς ἅπαντα ἐκ πάσης τὰ πάθη, ὀρθῷ δὲ ἐπιτρέψας τὰ καθ᾽ ἑαυτὸν λόγῳ\r\nκαὶ νῷ κυβερνάσθω. κεφάλαιον γὰρ ἦν, ὡς ἐγὼ οἶμαι, τοῦτο τῆς Διογένους\r\nφιλοσοφίας.\r\n\r\n(Yet this was not the chief end and aim of those Cynics, but as I said\r\ntheir main concern was how they might themselves attain to happiness and,\r\nas I think, they occupied themselves with other men only in so far as they\r\ncomprehended that man is by nature a social and political animal; and so\r\nthey aided their fellow‐citizens, not only by practising but by preaching\r\nas well. Then let him who wishes to be a Cynic, earnest and sincere, first\r\ntake himself in hand like Diogenes and Crates, and expel from his own soul\r\nand from every part of it all passions and desires, and entrust all his\r\naffairs to reason and intelligence and steer his course by them. For this\r\nin my opinion was the sum and substance of the philosophy of Diogenes.)\r\n\r\nΕἰ δὲ ἑταίρᾳ ποτὲ προσῆλθεν ὁ ἀνήρ· καίτοι καὶ τοῦτο τυχὸν ἅπαξ ἢ οὐδὲ\r\nἅπαξ ἐγένετο· ὅταν ἡμῖν [202] τὰ ἄλλα κατὰ τὸν Διογένη γένηται σπουδαῖος,\r\nἂν αὐτῷ(103) φανῇ καὶ τοιοῦτόν τι δρᾶν(104) φανερῶς ἐν ὀφθαλμοὶς πάντων,\r\nοὐ μεμψόμεθα οὐδὲ αἰτιασόμεθα. πρότερον μέντοι τὴν Διογένους ἡμῖν\r\nἐπιδειξάμενος εὐμάθειαν καὶ τὴν ἀγχίνοιαν καὶ τὴν ἐν τοῖς ἄλλοις ἅπασιν\r\nἐλευθερίαν, αὐτάρκειαν, δικαιοσύνην, σωφροσύνην, εὐλάβειαν, χάριν,\r\nπροσοχήν, ὡς μηδὲν εἰκῇ μηδὲ μάτην μηδὲ ἀλόγως ποιεῖν· [B] ἐπεὶ καὶ ταῦτα\r\nτῆς Διογένους ἐστὶ φιλοσοφίας οἰκεῖα· πατείτω τῦφον, καταπαιζέτω τῶν τὰ\r\nμὲν ἀναγκαῖα τῆς φύσεως ἔργα κρυπτόντων ἐν σκότῳ· φημὶ δὲ τῶν περιττωμάτων\r\nτὰς ἐκκρίσεις· ἐν μέσαις δὲ ταῖς ἀγοραῖς καὶ ταῖς πόλεσιν ἐπιτηδευόντων τὰ\r\nβιαιότατα καὶ μηδὲν ἡμῶν οἰκεῖα τῇ φύσει, χρημάτων ἁρπαγάς, συκοφαντίας,\r\nγραφὰς ἀδίκους, διώξεις ἄλλων τοιούτων συρφετωδῶν πραγμάτων. ἐπεὶ καὶ\r\nΔιογένης εἴτε [C] ἀπέπαρδεν εἴτε ἀπεπάτησεν εἴτε ἄλλο τι τοιοῦτον ἔπραξεν,\r\nὥσπερ οὖν λέγουσιν, ἐν ἀγορᾷ, τὸν ἐκείνων πατῶν τῦφον ἐποίει, διδάσκων\r\nαὐτούς, ὅτι πολλῷ φαυλότερα καὶ χαλεπώτερα τούτων ἐπιτηδεύουσι. τὰ μὲν γάρ\r\nἐστιν ἡμῖν πᾶσι κατὰ φύσιν, τὰ δὲ ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν οὐδενί, πάντα δὲ ἐκ\r\nδιαστροφῆς ἐπιτηδεύεται.\r\n\r\n(And if Diogenes did sometimes visit a courtesan—though even this happened\r\nonly once perhaps or not even once—let him who would be a Cynic first\r\nsatisfy us that he is, like Diogenes, a man of solid worth, and then if he\r\nsee fit to do that sort of thing openly and in the sight of all men, we\r\nshall not reproach him with it or accuse him. First however we must see\r\nhim display the ability to learn and the quick wit of Diogenes, and in all\r\nother relations he must show the same independence, self‐sufficiency,\r\njustice, moderation, piety, gratitude, and the same extreme carefulness\r\nnot to act at random or without a purpose or irrationally. For these too\r\nare characteristic of the philosophy of Diogenes. Then let him trample on\r\nvaingloriousness, let him ridicule those who though they conceal in\r\ndarkness the necessary functions of our nature—for instance the secretion\r\nof what is superfluous—yet in the centre of the market‐place and of our\r\ncities carry on practices that are most brutal and by no means akin to our\r\nnature, for instance robbery of money, false accusations, unjust\r\nindictments, and the pursuit of other rascally business of the same sort.\r\nOn the other hand when Diogenes made unseemly noises or obeyed the call of\r\nnature or did anything else of that sort in the market‐place, as they say\r\nhe did, he did so because he was trying to trample on the conceit of the\r\nmen I have just mentioned, and to teach them that their practices were far\r\nmore sordid and insupportable than his own. For what he did was in\r\naccordance with the nature of all of us, but theirs accorded with no man’s\r\nreal nature, one may say, but were all due to moral depravity.)\r\n\r\nἈλλ᾽ οἱ νῦν τοῦ Διογένους ζηλωταὶ τὸ ῥᾷστον καὶ κουφότατον ἑλόμενοι τὸ\r\nκρεῖττον οὐκ εἶδον· σύ τε ἐκείνων [D] εἶναι σεμνότερος ἐθέλων ἀπεπλανήθης\r\nτοσοῦτον τῆς Διογένους προαιρέσεως, ὥστε αὐτὸν ἐλεεινὸν ἐνόμισας. εἰ δὲ\r\nτούτοις μὲν ἠπίστεις ὑπὲρ ἀνδρὸς λεγομένοις, ὃν οἱ πάντες Ἕλληνες τότε\r\nἐθαύμασαν μετὰ Σωκράτη καὶ Πυθαγόραν ἐπὶ Πλάτωνος καὶ Ἀριστοτέλους, οὗ\r\nγέγονεν ἀκροατῆς ὁ τοῦ σωφρονεστάτου καὶ συνετωτάτου Ζήνωνος καθηγεμών,\r\nοὓς οὐκ εἰκὸς ἦν ἅπαντας ἀπατηθῆναι περὶ ἀνδρὸς οὕτω φαύλου, ὁποῖον σὺ\r\nδιακωμῳδεῖς, [203] ὦ βέλτιστε, ἴσως ἄν τι πλέον ἐσκόπησας περὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ\r\nπορρωτέρω προῆλθες τῆς ἐμπειρίας τἀνδρός. τίνα γὰρ οὐκ ἐξέπληξε τῶν\r\nἙλλήνων ἡ Διογένους καρτερία, βασιλικῆς οὐκ ἔξω μεγαλοψυχίας οὖσα, καὶ\r\nφιλοπονία; ἐκάθευδεν ἁνὴρ ἐπὶ στιβάδος ἐν τῷ πίθῳ βέλτιον ἢ μέγας βασιλεὺς\r\nὑπὸ τοῖς ἐπιχρύσοις ὀρόφοις ἐν τῇ μαλθακῇ κλίνῃ, ἤσθιε τὴν μᾶζαν ἥδιον ἢ\r\nσὺ νῦν τὰς Σικελικὰς [B] ἐσθίεις τραπέζας, ἐλούετο ψυχρῇ(105) τὸ σῶμα πρὸς\r\nἀέρα ξηραίνων ἀντὶ τῶν ὀθονίων, οἷς σὺ ἀπομάττῃ, φιλοσοφώτατε. πάνυ σοι\r\nπροσήκει κωμῳδεῖν ἐκεῖνον, ὅτι κατειργάσω τὸν Ξέρξην, ὡς ὁ Θεμιστοκλῆς, ἢ\r\nτὸν Δαρεῖον, ὡς ὁ Μακεδὼν Ἀλέξανδρος. εἰ σμικρὰ τὰς βίβλους ἀνελίττων\r\nἐμελέτας ὥσπερ ἡμεῖς οἱ πολιτικοὶ καὶ πολυπράγμονες, ἔγνως ἄν, ὅπως\r\nἈλέξανδρος ἀγασθῆναι λέγεται τὴν Διογένους μεγαλοψυχίαν. ἀλλ᾽ οὐκ ἔστι σοι\r\nτούτων οὐδέν, ὡς ἐμοὶ δοκεῖ, σπουδαῖον· πόθεν; πολλοῦ γε καὶ δεῖ· γυναικῶν\r\nἀθλίων τεθαύμακας φιλονεικῶν(106) βίον.\r\n\r\n(In our own day, however, the imitators of Diogenes have chosen only what\r\nis easiest and least burdensome and have failed to see his nobler side.\r\nAnd as for you, in your desire to be more dignified than those early\r\nCynics you have strayed so far from Diogenes’ plan of life that you\r\nthought him an object of pity. But if you did not believe all this that I\r\nsay about a man whom all the Greeks in the generation of Plato and\r\nAristotle admired next to Socrates and Pythagoras, a man whose pupil was\r\nthe teacher of the most modest and most wise Zeno,—and it is not likely\r\nthat they were all deceived about a man as contemptible as you make him\r\nout to be in your travesty,—well, in that case, my dear sir, perhaps you\r\nmight have studied his character more carefully and you would have\r\nprogressed further in your knowledge of the man. Was there, I ask, a\r\nsingle Greek who was not amazed by the endurance of Diogenes and by his\r\nperseverance, which had in it a truly royal greatness of soul? The man\r\nused to sleep in his jar on a bed of leaves more soundly than the Great\r\nKing on his soft couch under a gilded roof; he used to eat his crust(107)\r\nwith a better appetite than you now eat your Sicilian courses(108); he\r\nused to bathe his body in cold water and dry himself in the open air\r\ninstead of with the linen towels with which you rub yourself down, my most\r\nphilosophic friend! It becomes you well to ridicule him because, I\r\nsuppose, like Themistocles you conquered Xerxes, or Darius like Alexander\r\nof Macedon. But if you had the least habit of reading books as I do,\r\nthough I am a statesman and engrossed in public affairs, you would know\r\nhow much Alexander is said to have admired Diogenes’ greatness of soul.\r\nBut you care little, I suppose, for any of these things. How should you\r\ncare? Far from it!(109) You admire and emulate the life of wretched\r\nwomen.)\r\n\r\nΕἰ μὲν οὖν ὁ λόγος τι πλέον ἐποίησεν, οὐκ ἐμὸν μᾶλλον ἢ σόν ἐστι κέρδος·\r\nεἰ δὲ οὐδὲν περαίνομεν ἐκ τοῦ παραχρῆμα περὶ τῶν τοιούτων ἀπνευστὶ τὸ δὴ\r\nλεγόμενον συνείραντες· ἔστι γὰρ πάρεργον ἡμέραιν δυοῖν, ὡς ἴσασιν αἱ\r\nΜοῦσαι, μᾶλλον δὲ καὶ σὺ(110) αὐτός· παραμενέτω μέν σοι ὁπόσα πρόσθεν\r\nἐγνώκεις, ἡμῖν δὲ οὐ μεταμελήσει τῆς εἰς τὸν ἄνδρα εὐφημίας.\r\n\r\n(However, if my discourse has improved you at all you will have gained\r\nmore than I. But even if I accomplish nothing at the moment by writing on\r\nsuch a great subject thus hastily, and, as the saying is, without taking\r\nbreath(111)—for I gave to it only the leisure of two days, as the Muses or\r\nrather you yourself will bear me witness—then do you abide by your former\r\nopinions, but I at any rate shall never regret having spoken of that great\r\nman with due reverence.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORATION VII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction to Oration VII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Seventh Oration is directed against the Cynic Heracleios, who had\r\nventured to recite before an audience when Julian was present a myth or\r\nallegory in which the gods were irreverently handled. Julian raises the\r\nquestion whether fables and myths are suitable for a Cynic discourse. He\r\nnames the regular divisions of philosophy and decides that the use of\r\nmyths may properly be allowed only to ethical philosophers and writers on\r\ntheology: that myth is intended always as a means of religious teaching\r\nand should be addressed to children and those whose intellect does not\r\nallow them to envisage the truth without some such assistance. In\r\nSallust’s treatise _On the Gods and the World_ he gives much the same\r\naccount of the proper function of myths and divides them into five\r\nspecies, giving examples of each. “To wish to teach the whole truth about\r\nthe gods to all produces contempt in the foolish, because they cannot\r\nunderstand, and lack of zeal in the good; whereas to conceal the truth by\r\nmyths prevents the contempt of the foolish and compels the good to\r\npractise philosophy.”(112) This is precisely the opinion of Julian as\r\nexpressed in the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Orations. Though both Julian and\r\nSallust explain the myths away they are never rationalistic, and never\r\noffer the least excuse for scepticism. Julian’s explanation of the Semele\r\nmyth,(113) which makes Semele an inspired prophetess and not the mother of\r\nDionysus, tends to the greater glory of the god. The conclusion is that\r\nHeracleios should not have used myth at all, but in any case he used the\r\nwrong sort and wrote in the wrong spirit. He should have used such a myth\r\nas that composed by Prodicus the sophist on the Choice of Heracles at the\r\nCrossroads, an allegory which is more than once cited by Julian and was a\r\nfavourite illustration in later Greek literature.(114)\r\n\r\nTo show Heraclius what he might have written with propriety Julian adds a\r\nparable of his own modelled on that of Prodicus. In this he himself plays\r\nthe part of a second Heracles, and takes the opportunity to vilify\r\nConstantius and point out his own mission of reformer and restorer of\r\norder and religion to the Empire. Throughout the parable there are\r\nstriking resemblances with the First Oration of Dio Chrysostom, and\r\nAsmus(115) has made a detailed comparison of the two writers to prove that\r\nJulian wrote with Dio before him. In many of these parallels both Julian\r\nand Dio can be traced to a common classical source, usually Plato, but\r\nthere is no doubt that Julian was thoroughly familiar with the work of Dio\r\nand often used the same illustrations. Themistius(116) however uses the\r\nProdicus myth in much the same words as Dio, and it is imitated also by\r\nMaximus of Tyre.(117)\r\n\r\nIn conclusion Julian praises the earlier Cynics and criticises the later,\r\nin much the same words as he had used in the Sixth Oration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[204] ΙΟΥΛΙΑΝΟΥ ΑΥΤΟΚΡΑΤΟΡΟΣ\r\n\r\n(Julian, Emperor)\r\n\r\nΠΡΟΣ ΗΡΑΚΛΕΙΟΝ ΚΥΝΙΚΟΝ\r\n\r\n(To the Cynic Heracleios)\r\n\r\nΠΕΡΙ ΤΟΥ ΠΩΣ ΚΥΝΙΣΤΕΟΝ ΚΑΙ ΕΙ ΠΡΕΠΕΙ ΤΩ ΚΥΝΙ ΜΥΘΟΥΣ ΠΛΑΤΤΕΙΝ\r\n\r\n(How a Cynic Ought to Behave, and Whether it is Proper For Him to Compose\r\nMyths)\r\n\r\nἮ πολλὰ γίνεται ἐν μακρῷ χρόνῳ· τοῦτο ἐκ τῆς κωμῳδίας ἀκηκοότι μοι πρῴην\r\nἐπῆλθεν ἐκβοῆσαι, ὁπηνίκα παρακληθέντες ἠκροώμεθα κυνὸς οὔτι τορὸν οὐδὲ\r\nγενναῖον ὑλακτοῦντος, ἀλλ᾽ ὥσπερ αἱ τίτθαι μύθους ᾄδοντος καὶ οὐδὲ τούτους\r\nὑγιῶς διατιθεμένου. παραχρῆμα μὲν οὖν ἐπῆλθέ μοι διαναστάντι διαλῦσαι τὸν\r\nσύλλογον· [B] ἐπεὶ δὲ ἐχρῆν ὥσπερ ἐν θεάτρῳ κωμῳδουμένων Ἡρακλέους καὶ\r\nΔιονύσου παρὰ τῶν κωμῳδῶν ἀκούειν, οὐ τοῦ λέγοντος, ἀλλὰ τῶν συνειλεγμένων\r\nχάριν ὑπέμεινα, μάλλον δέ, εἰ χρή τι καὶ νεανικώτερον εἰπεῖν, ἡμῶν αὐτῶν\r\nἕνεκα καὶ τοῦ μὴ δοκεῖν ὑπὸ δεισιδαιμονίας μᾶλλον [C] ἢ διανοίας εὐσεβοῦς\r\nκαὶ λελογισμένης, ὥσπερ αἱ πελειάδες, ὑπὸ τῶν ῥηματίων σοβηθεὶς ἀναπτῆναι.\r\nἔμενον δὲ ἐκεῖνο πρὸς ἐμαυτὸν εἰπὼν\r\n\r\n(“Truly with the lapse of time many things come to pass!”(118) This verse\r\nI have heard in a comedy and the other day I was tempted to proclaim it\r\naloud, when by invitation we attended the lecture of a Cynic whose barking\r\nwas neither distinct nor noble; but he was crooning myths as nurses do,\r\nand even these he did not compose in any profitable fashion. For a moment\r\nmy impulse was to rise and break up the meeting. But though I had to\r\nlisten as one does when Heracles and Dionysus are being caricatured in the\r\ntheatre by comic poets,(119) I bore it to the end, not for the speaker’s\r\nsake but for the sake of the audience, or rather, if I may presume to say\r\nso, it was still more for my own sake, so that I might not seem to be\r\nmoved by superstition rather than by a pious and rational sentiment and to\r\nbe scared into flight by his miserable words like a timid dove.

But perhaps it is\r\nnot unsuitable for me to say and for you to hear a few words about myth in\r\ngeneral as a sort of genealogy of that kind of writing.)\r\n\r\nΤὴν μὲν οὖν ἀρχὴν ὁπόθεν ηὑρέθη καὶ ὅστις ὁ πρῶτος ἐπιχειρήσας τὸ ψεῦδος\r\nπιθανῶς συνθεῖναι πρὸς ὠφέλειαν ἢ ψυχαγωγίαν τῶν ἀκροωμώνων, οὐ μᾶλλον\r\nεὔροι τις ἂν ἢ εἴ τις ἐπιχειρήσειε τὸν πρῶτον πταρόντα ἢ χρεμψάμενον\r\nἀναζητεῖν. εἰ δέ, [D] ὥσπερ ἱππεῖς ἐν Θράκῃ καὶ Θετταλίᾳ, τοξόται δὲ καὶ\r\nτὰ κουφότερα τῶν ὅπλων ἐν Ἰνδίᾳ καὶ Κρήτῃ καὶ Καρίᾳ ἀνεφάνη,(121) τῇ φύσει\r\nτῆς χώρας ἀκολουθούντων οἶμαι τῶν ἐπιτηδευμάτων, οὕτω τις ὑπολαμβάνει καὶ\r\nἐπὶ τῶν ἄλλων πραγμάτων, ἐν οἷς ἕκαστα τιμᾶται, μάλιστα παρὰ τούτων αὐτὰ\r\nκαὶ πρῶτον ηὑρῆσθαι· τῶν ἀγελαίων ἔοικεν ἀνθρώπων εἶναι [206] τό γε ἐξ\r\nἀρχῆς ὁ μύθος εὕρημα, καὶ διαμένει ἐξ ἐκείνου μέχρι καὶ νῦν παρ᾽ αὐτοῖς\r\nπολιτευόμενον τὸ πρᾶγμα ὥσπερ ἄλλο τι τῶν ἀκροαμάτων, αὐλὸς καὶ κιθάρα,\r\nτέρψεως ἕνεκα καὶ ψυχαγωγίας. ὥσπερ γὰρ οἱ(122) ὄρνιθες ἵπτασθαι καὶ νεῖν\r\nοἱ(123) ἰχθύες αἵ τε ἔλαφοι θεῖν ἐπειδὴ πεφύκασιν οὐδὲν τοῦ διδαχθῆναι\r\nπροσδέονται, κἂν δήσῃ τις κἂν καθείρξῃ, πειρᾶται ὅμως χρῆσθαι τούτοις τοῖς\r\nμορίοις, πρὸς ἃ σύνοιδεν αὑτοῖς πεφυκόσι, ταυτὶ τὰ ζῷα, οὕτως οἶμαι καὶ τὸ\r\nτῶν ἀνθρώπων [B] γένος οὐκ ἄλλο τι τὴν ψυχὴν ἔχον ἢ λόγον καὶ ἐπιστήμην\r\nὥσπερ ἐγκαθειργμένην, ὃ δὴ καὶ λέγουσιν οἱ σοφοὶ δέναμιν, ἐπὶ τὸ μανθάνειν\r\nτε(124) καὶ ζητεῖν καὶ πολυπραγμονεῖν, ὡς πρὸς οἰκειότατον ἑαυτῷ τῶν\r\nἔργων, τρέπεται· καὶ ὅτῳ μὲν εὐμενὴς θεὸς ταχέως ἔλυσε τὰ δεσμὰ καὶ τὴν\r\nδύναμιν εἰς ἐνέργειαν ἤγαγε, τούτῳ πάρεστιν εὐθὺς ἐπιστήμη, τοῖς\r\nδεδεμένοις δὲ ἔτι, [C] καθάπερ οἶμαι Ἰξίων νεφέλῃ τινὶ(125) ἀντὶ τῆς θεοῦ\r\nλέγεται παραναπαύσασθαι, τούτοις ἀντ᾽ ἀληθοῦς ψευδὴς(126) ἐντέτηκε δόξα·\r\nγίνεται γὰρ ἐντεῦθεν αὐτοῖς(127) τὰ ὑπηνέμια καὶ τερατώδη ταυτὶ τῆς\r\nἀληθοῦς ἐπιστήμης οἷον εἴδωλα ἄττα καὶ σκιαί· πράττουσι γοῦν πρὸ τῆς τῶν\r\nἀληθῶν ἐπιστήμης τὰ ψεύδη καὶ διδάσκουσί γε μάλα προθύμως καὶ μανθάνουσιν\r\nὥσπερ οἶμαι χρηστόν τι καὶ θαυμαστόν. εἰ δ᾽ ὅλως χρή τι καὶ ὑπὲρ τῶν τοὺς\r\nμύθους τὸ πρῶτον [D] πλασάντων ἀπολογήσασθαι, δοκοῦσί μοι ταῖς τῶν παιδίων\r\nψυχαῖς, ὥσπερ αἱ τίτθαι περὶ τὰς ὀδοντοφυïας κνησιῶσιν αἰτοῖς σκύτινα ἄττα\r\nπροσαρτῶσι(128) ταῖν χεροῖν, ἵνα αὐτῶν παραμυθήσωνται τὸ πάθος, οὕτω δὲ\r\nκαὶ οὗτοι τῷ ψυχαρίῳ πτεροφυοῦντι καὶ ποθοῦντι πλέον εἰδέναι τι,\r\nδιδάσκεσθαι δὲ οὔπω τἀληθῆ δυναμένῳ ταῦτα ἐποχετεύειν, ὥσπερ ἄρδοντες\r\nἄρουραν διψῶσαν, ἵνα δὴ οἶμαι αὐτῶν τὸν γαργαλισμὸν καὶ τὴν ὀδύνην\r\nπαραμυθήσωνται.\r\n\r\n(Now one could no more discover where myth was originally invented and who\r\nwas the first to compose fiction in a plausible manner for the benefit or\r\nentertainment of his hearers, than if one were to try to find out who was\r\nthe first man that sneezed or the first horse that neighed. But as cavalry\r\narose in Thrace and Thessaly(129) and archers and the lighter sort of\r\nweapons in India, Crete and Caria—since the customs of the people were I\r\nsuppose adapted to the nature of the country,—just so we may assume about\r\nother things as well, that where anything is highly prized by a nation it\r\nwas first discovered by that nation rather than by any other. On this\r\nassumption then it seems likely that myth was originally the invention of\r\nmen given to pastoral pursuits, and from that day to this the making of\r\nmyths is still peculiarly cultivated by them, just as they first invented\r\ninstruments of music, the flute and the lyre, for their pleasure and\r\nentertainment. For just as it is the nature of birds to fly and of fish to\r\nswim and of stags to run, and hence they need not be taught to do so; and\r\neven if one bind or imprison these animals they try none the less to use\r\nthose special parts of themselves for the purpose for which they know they\r\nare naturally adapted; even so I think the human race whose soul is no\r\nother than reason and knowledge imprisoned so to speak in the body—the\r\nphilosophers call it a potentiality—even so I say the human race inclines\r\nto learning, research and study, as of all tasks most congenial to it. And\r\nwhen a kindly god without delay looses a man’s fetters and brings that\r\npotentiality into activity, then on the instant knowledge is his: whereas\r\nin those who are still imprisoned false opinion instead of true is\r\nimplanted, just as, I think, Ixion is said to have embraced a sort of\r\ncloud instead of the goddess.(130) And hence they produce wind‐eggs(131)\r\nand monstrous births, mere phantoms and shadows so to speak of true\r\nscience. And thus instead of genuine science they profess false doctrines,\r\nand are very zealous in learning and teaching such doctrines, as though\r\nforsooth they were something useful and admirable. But if I am bound to\r\nsay something in defence of those who originally invented myths, I think\r\nthey wrote them for childish souls: and I liken them to nurses who hand\r\ntoys to the hands of children when they are irritated by teething, in\r\norder to ease their suffering: so those mythologists wrote for the feeble\r\nsoul whose wings are just beginning to sprout, and who, though still\r\nincapable of being taught the truth, is yearning for further knowledge,\r\nand they poured in a stream of myths like men who water a thirsty field,\r\nso as to soothe their irritation and pangs.(132))\r\n\r\n[207] Τοῦ δὲ τοιούτου προβαίνοντος καὶ παρὰ τοῖς Ἕλλησιν εὐδοκιμοῦντος,\r\nεἵλκυσαν ἐντεῦθεν οἱ ποιηταὶ τὸν αἶνον, ὃς τοῦ μύθου διαφέρει τῷ μὴ πρὸς\r\nπαῖδας, ἀλλὰ πρὸς ἄνδρας πεποιῆσθαι καὶ μὴ ψυχαγωγίαν μόνον, ἀλλὰ καὶ\r\nπαραίνεσιν ἔχειν τινά. βούλεται γὰρ ἐπικρυπτόμενος παραινεῖν τε καὶ\r\nδιδάσκειν, ὅταν ὁ λέγων τὸ φανερῶς εἰπεῖν εὐλαβῆται, [B] τὴν παρὰ τῶν\r\nἀκουόντων ὑφορώμενος ἀπέχθειαν. οὕτω τοι καὶ Ἡσίοδος αὐτὸ φαίνεται\r\nπεποιηκώς· ὁ δὲ μετὰ τοῦτον Ἀρχίλοχος ὥσπερ ἥδυσμά τι περιτιθεὶς τῇ\r\nποιήσει, μύθοις οὐκ ὀλιγάκις ἐχρήσατο ὁρῶν, ὡς εἰκός, τὴν μὲν ὑπόθεσιν, ἣν\r\nμετῄει, τῆς τοιαύτης ψυχαγωγίας ἐνδεῶς ἔχουσαν, σαφῶς δὲ ἐγνωκώς, ὅτι\r\nστερομένη μύθου ποίησις ἐποποιΐα μόνον ἐστίν, ἐστέρηται δέ, ὡς ἂν εἴποι\r\nτισ, ἑαυτῆς, οὐ γὰρ ἔτι λείπεται ποίησις, ἡδύσματα ταῦτα παρὰ τῆς\r\nποιητικῆς Μούσης ἐδρέψατο, [C] καὶ παρέθηκέ γε αὐτοῦ τούτου χάριν, ὅπως μὴ\r\nσιλλογράφος τις, ἀλλὰ ποιητὴς νομισθείη.\r\n\r\n(Then when the myth was gaining ground and coming into favour in Greece,\r\npoets developed from it the fable with a moral, which differs from the\r\nmyth in that the latter is addressed to children and the former to men,\r\nand is designed not merely to entertain them but conveys moral exhortation\r\nbesides. For the man who employs fable aims at moral exhortation and\r\ninstruction, though he conceals his aim and takes care not to speak\r\nopenly, for fear of alienating his hearers. Hesiod, for instance, seems to\r\nhave written with this in view. And after him Archilochus often employed\r\nmyths,(133) adorning and as it were seasoning his poetry with them,\r\nprobably because he saw that his subject matter needed something of this\r\nsort to make it attractive, and he well knew that poetry without myth is\r\nmerely versification(134) and lacks, one may say, its essential\r\ncharacteristic, and so ceases to be poetry at all. Therefore he culled\r\nthese sweets from the Muse of Poetry and offered them to his readers, in\r\norder that he might not be ranked merely as a writer of satire but might\r\nbe counted a poet.)\r\n\r\nὉ δὲ δὴ τῶν μύθων Ὅμηρος ἢ Θουκυδίδης ἢ Πλάτων, ἢ ὅ, τι βούλει καλεῖν\r\nαὐτόν, Αἴσωπος ἦν ὁ Σάμιος, δοῦλος τὴν τύχην(135) μᾶλλον ἢ τὴν προαίρεσιν,\r\nοὐκ ἄφρων μὴν(136) οὐδὲ κατ᾽ αὐτὸ τοῦτο ἀνήρ. ᾧ γὰρ ὁ νόμος οὐ μετεδίδου\r\nπαρρησίας, τούτῳ προσῆκον ἦν ἐσκιαγραφημένας τὰς συμβουλὰς καὶ\r\nπεποικιλμένας ἡδονῇ καὶ χάριτι παραφέρειν, ὥσπερ οἶμαι τῶν ἰατρῶν οἱ μὲν\r\nἐλεύθεροι τὸ δέον ἐπιτάττουσιν, [D] ἐὰν δὲ ἅμα τις οἰκέτης γένηται τὴν\r\nτύχην καὶ τὴν τέχνην ἰατρός, πράγματα ἔχει κολακεύειν ἅμα καὶ θεραπεύειν\r\nτὸν δεσπότην ἀναγκαζόμενος. εἰ μὲν οὖν καὶ τῷ κυνὶ προσήκει ταύτης τῆς\r\nδουλείας, λεγέτω, γραφέτω, παραχωρείτω τῆς μυθολογίας αὐτῷ πᾶς ὁστισοῦν,\r\nεἰ δὲ μόνος εἶναί φησιν ἐλεύθεροσ, ἐπὶ τί χρήσεται τοῖς μύθοις, οὐκ οἶδα.\r\nπότερον ἵνα τὸ πικρὸν καὶ δάκνον τῆς συμβουλῆς ἡδονῇ καὶ χάριτι κεράσας\r\n[208] ἅμα τε ὀνήσῃ καὶ ἀποφύγῃ τὸ προσλαβεῖν τι παρὰ τοῦ ὀνιναμένου κακόν;\r\nἀλλὰ τοῦτό ἐστι λίαν δουλοπρεπές. ἀλλ᾽ ἄμεινον ἄν τις διδαχθείη μὴ τὰ\r\nπράγματα ἀκούων αὐτὰ μηδὲ τὰ ἐπ᾽ αὐτοῖς ὀνόματα κατὰ τὸν κωμικὸν τὴν\r\nσκάφην σκάφην λέγοντα; ἀλλ᾽ ἀντὶ τοῦ μὲν δεῖνος τὸν Φαέθοντα τί(137) δέον\r\nἐνομάσαι; [B] τί δὲ χραίνειν οὐκ εὐαγῶς τὴν ἐπωνυμίαν τοῦ βασιλέως Ἠλίου;\r\nτίς δὲ ὁ Πὰν καὶ τίς ὁ Ζεὺς τῶν χαμαὶ ἐρχομένων ἀνθρώπων ἄξιος καλεῖσθαι,\r\nἵν᾽ ἐκεῖθεν ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς μεταθῶμεν ἡμῶν τὰς διανοίας; καίτοι, εἰ καὶ τοῦτο\r\nοἷόν τε ἦν, ἄμεινον ἦν αὐτοὺς ἐνομάσαι τοὺς ἀνθρώπους. ἦ γὰρ οὐχ οὕτω\r\nκρεῖττον ἦν εἰπεῖν ἀνθρωπικὰ θεμένους ὀνόματα; μᾶλλον δὲ οὐδὲ θεμένους,\r\n[C] ἤρκει γὰρ ὅσαπερ ἡμῖν οἱ γονεῖς ἔθεντο. ἀλλ᾽ εἰ μήτε μαθεῖν ἐστι\r\nῥᾷον(138) διὰ τοῦ πλάσματος μήτε τῷ Κυνικῷ πρέπον πλάττειν τὰ τοιαῦτα, τοῦ\r\nχάριν οὐκ ἐφεισάμεθα τοῦ πολυτελοῦς ἀναλώματος, πρὸς δὲ δὴ καὶ ἐφθείραμεν\r\nτὸν χρόνον πλάττοντες καὶ συντιθέντες μυθάρια, εἶτα λογογραφοῦντες καὶ\r\nἐκμανθάνοντες;\r\n\r\n(But the Homer of myths, or their Thucydides, or Plato, or whatever we\r\nmust call him, was Aesop of Samos, who was a slave by the accident of\r\nbirth rather than by temperament, and he proved his sagacity by this very\r\nuse of fable. For since the law did not allow him freedom of speech, he\r\nhad no resource but to shadow forth his wise counsels and trick them out\r\nwith charms and graces and so serve them up to his hearers. Just so, I\r\nthink, physicians who are free‐born men prescribe what is necessary, but\r\nwhen a man happens to be a slave by birth and a physician by profession,\r\nhe is forced to take pains to flatter and cure his master at the same\r\ntime. Now if our Cynic also is subject to this sort of slavery, let him\r\nrecite myths, let him write them, and let everyone else under the sun\r\nleave to him the _rôle_ of mythologist. But since he asserts that he alone\r\nis free, I do not know what need he has of myths. Does he need to temper\r\nthe harshness and severity of his advice with sweetness and charm, so that\r\nhe may at once benefit mankind and avoid being harmed by one whom he has\r\nbenefited? Nay, that is too much like a slave. Moreover, would any man be\r\nbetter taught by not hearing facts as they really are, or called by their\r\nreal names, like the comic poet who calls a spade a spade?(139) What need\r\nto speak of Phaethon instead of So‐and‐so? What need sacrilegiously to\r\nprofane the title of King Helios? Who among men that walk here below(140)\r\nis worthy to be called Pan or Zeus, as though we should ascribe to those\r\ngods our human understanding? And yet if indeed this were possible it\r\nwould have been better to give the men their own names. Would it not have\r\nbeen better to speak of them thus and to bestow on them human names, or\r\nrather not bestow, for those that our parents gave us were enough? Well\r\nthen if it is neither easier to learn by means of fiction, nor appropriate\r\nfor the Cynic to invent that sort of thing at all, why did we not spare\r\nthat wasteful expense,(141) and moreover why did we waste our time in\r\ninventing and composing trivial myths and then making stories of them and\r\nlearning them by heart?)\r\n\r\nἈλλ᾽ ἴσως ὁ μὲν λόγος οὔ φησι δεῖν ἀντὶ τῶν ἀληθῶν [D] καὶ μὴ πεπλασμένων\r\nτὰ ψευδῆ καὶ πεπλασμένα παρὰ τοῦ κυνός, ᾧ μόνῳ τῆς ἐλευθερίας μέτεστιν, ἐν\r\nτοῖς κοινοῖς ᾄδεσθαι συλλόγοις, ἡ συνήθεια δὲ οὕτω(142) γέγονεν ἀπὸ\r\nΔιογένους ἀρξαμένη καὶ Κράτητος ἄχρι τῶν ἐφεξῆς. οὐδὲν οὐδαμοῦ παράδειγμα\r\nτοιοῦτον εὑρήσεις· ἐκεῖνο γὰρ ἀφίημι τέως, ὅτι τῷ Κυνικῷ τὸ νόμισμα\r\nπαραχαράττοντι τῇ συνηθείᾳ προσέχειν οὐδαμῶς προσήκει, τῷ λόγῳ δὲ αὐτῷ\r\nμόνῳ, [209] καὶ τὸ ποιητέον εὑρίσκειν οἴκοθεν, ἀλλ᾽ οὐ μανθάνειν ἔξωθεν.\r\nεἰ δ᾽ Ἀντισθένης ὁ Σωκρατικὸς ὥσπερ ὁ Ξενοφῶν ἔνια διὰ τῶν μύθων ἀπήγελλε,\r\nμήτι(143) τοῦτό σε ἐξαπατάτω· καὶ γὰρ μικρὸν ὕστερον ὑπὲρ τούτου σοι\r\nδιαλέξομαι·(144) νῦν δὲ ἐκεῖνό μοι πρὸς τῶν Μουσῶν φράσον ὑπὲρ τοῦ\r\nΚυνισμοῦ, πότερον ἀπόνοια τίς ἐστι καὶ βίος οὐκ ἀνθρώπινος, ἀλλὰ θηριώδης\r\nψυχῆς διάθεσις οὐδὲν καλόν, οὐδὲν σπουδαῖον οὐδὲ ἀγαθὸν νομιζούσης; [B]\r\nδοίη γὰρ ἂν ὑπολαβεῖν πολλοῖς περὶ αὐτοῦ ταῦτα Οἰνόμαος. εἴ τί σοι τοῦ\r\nταῦτα γοῦν ἐπελθεῖν ἐμέλησεν, ἐπέγνως ἂν σαφῶς ἐν τῇ τοῦ κυνὸς αὐτοφωνίᾳ\r\nκαὶ τῷ κατὰ τῶν χρηστηρίων καὶ πᾶσιν ἁπλῶς οἷς ἔγραψεν ὁ ἀνήρ. τοιούτου δὲ\r\nὄντος τοῦ πράγματος, ὥστε ἐνῃρῆσθαι μὲν ἅπασαν τὴν πρὸς τοὺς θεοὺς\r\nεὐλάβειαν, ἠτιμάσθαι δὲ πᾶσαν ἀνθρωπίνην φρόνησιν, νόμον δὲ μὴ τὸν\r\nὁμώνυμον τῷ καλῷ καὶ δικαίῳ πεπατῆσθαι μόνον, [C] ἀλλὰ καὶ τοὺς ἐκ τῶν\r\nθεῶν ἡμῖν ὥσπερ ἐγγραφέντας ταῖς ψυχαῖς, ὑφ᾽ ὧν πάντες ἀδιδάκτως εἶναι\r\nθεῖόν τι πεπείσμεθα καὶ πρὸς τοῦτο ἀφορᾶν ἐπ᾽ αὐτό τε οἶμαι σπεύδειν οὕτω\r\nδιατιθέμενοι τὰς ψυχὰς πρὸς αὐτὸ ὥσπερ, οἶμαι πρὸς τὸ φῶς τὰ βλέποντα,\r\nπρὸς τούτῳ δὲ εἰ καὶ ὁ δεύτερος ἐξελαύνοιτο νόμος ἱερὸς ὢν φύσει καὶ\r\nθεῖος, ὁ τῶν ἀλλοτρίων πάντη καὶ πάντως ἀπέχεσθαι κελεύων καὶ μήτε ἐν λόγῳ\r\nμήτε ἐν ἔργῳ μήτε [D] ἐν αὐταῖς ταῖς λανθανούσαις τῆς ψυχῆς ἐνεργείαις\r\nταῦτα ἐπιτρέπων συγχεῖν, ὅσπερ ἡμῖν καὶ τῆς τελειοτάτης ἐστὶν ἡγεμὼν\r\nδικαιοσύνης· ἆρ᾽ οὐκ ἔστι βαράθρου τὸ πρᾶγμα ἄξιον; ἆρ᾽ οὐ τοὺς ταῦτα\r\nἐπαινοῦντας ὥσπερ τοὺς φαρμακοὺς ἐχρῆν οὐ θύσθλοις παιομένους(145)\r\nἐλαύνεσθαι· κουφοτέρα γάρ ἐστι τῶν ἀδικημάτων ἡ ζημία· λίθοις δὲ\r\nβαλλομένους ἀπολωλέναι; διαφέρουσι γὰρ οὗτοι τί, [210] πρὸς τῶν θεῶν εἰπέ\r\nμοι, τῶν ἐπ᾽ ἐρημίας λῃστευόντων καὶ κατειληφότων τὰς ἀκτὰς ἐπὶ τῷ\r\nλυμαίνεσθαι τοῖς καταπλέουσι; καταφρονοῦντες θανάτου, φασίν· ὥσπερ οὐ\r\nκἀκείνοις συνομαρτούσης ταυτησὶ τῆς ἀπονοίας. φησὶ γοῦν ὁ καθ᾽ ὑμᾶς μὲν\r\nποιητὴς καὶ μυθολόγος, ὡς δὲ ὁ Πύθιος λῃσταῖς χρωμένοις ἀνεῖλεν, ἥρως καὶ\r\nδαίμων, ὑπὲρ τῶν λῃζομένων τὴν θάλατταν\r\n\r\n(But perhaps you will say that though reason asserts that the Cynic, who\r\nalone of men can claim to be free, ought not to invent and compose lying\r\nfictions instead of the unvarnished truth and then recite these in public\r\nassemblies, nevertheless the custom began with Diogenes and Crates, and\r\nhas been maintained from that time by all Cynics. My answer is that\r\nnowhere will you find a single example of such a custom. For the moment I\r\ndo not insist on the fact that it in no wise becomes a Cynic who must\r\n“give a new stamp to the common currency”(146) to pay any attention to\r\ncustom, but only to pure reason, and he ought to discover within himself\r\nwhat is right for him to do and not learn it from without. And do not be\r\nmisled by the fact that Antisthenes the disciple of Socrates, and Xenophon\r\ntoo, sometimes expressed themselves by means of myths; for I shall have\r\nsomething to say to you on this point in a moment. But now in the Muses’\r\nname answer me this question about the Cynic philosophy. Are we to think\r\nit a sort of madness, a method of life not suitable for a human being, but\r\nrather a brutal attitude of mind which recks naught of the beautiful, the\r\nhonourable, or the good? For Oenomaus(147) would make many people hold\r\nthis view of it. If you had taken any trouble to study the subject, you\r\nwould have learned this from that Cynic’s “Direct Inspiration of Oracles”\r\nand his work “Against the Oracles,” in short from everything that he\r\nwrote. This then is his aim, to do away with all reverence for the gods,\r\nto bring dishonour on all human wisdom, to trample on all law that can be\r\nidentified with honour and justice, and more than this, to trample on\r\nthose laws which have been as it were engraved on our souls by the gods,\r\nand have impelled us all to believe without teaching that the divine\r\nexists, and to direct our eyes to it and to yearn towards it: for our\r\nsouls are disposed towards it as eyes towards the light. Furthermore,\r\nsuppose that one should discard also that second law which is sanctified\r\nboth by nature and by God, I mean the law that bids us keep our hands\r\naltogether and utterly from the property of others and permits us neither\r\nby word or deed or in the inmost and secret activities of our souls to\r\nconfound such distinctions, since the law is our guide to the most perfect\r\njustice—is not this conduct worthy of pit?(148) And ought not those who\r\napplauded such views to have been driven forth, not by blows with wands,\r\nlike scapegoats,(149) for that penalty is too light for such crimes, but\r\nput to death by stoning? For tell me, in Heaven’s name, how are such men\r\nless criminal than bandits who infest lonely places and haunt the coasts\r\nin order to despoil navigators? Because, as people say, they despise\r\ndeath; as though bandits were not inspired by the same frenzied courage!\r\nSo says at any rate he(150) who with you counts as a poet and mythologist,\r\nthough, as a Pythian god proclaimed to certain bandits who sought his\r\noracle, he was a hero and divinity—I mean where, speaking of pirates of\r\nthe sea, he says:)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Οἷά τε ληιστῆρες, ὑπεὶρ ἅλα τοί τ᾽ ἀλόωνται\r\n    [B] Ψυχὰς παρθέμενοι.\r\n\r\n    (“Like pirates who wander over the sea, staking their\r\n    lives.”(151))\r\n\r\n\r\nτί οὖν ἔτι ἕτερον ζητεῖς ὑπὲρ τῆς ἀπονοίας τῶν λῃστῶν μάρτυρα; πλὴν εἰ μὴ\r\nκαὶ ἀνδρειοτέρους ἂν εἴποι τις τῶν τοιούτων κυνῶν ἐκείνους τοὺς λῃστάς,\r\nἰταμωτέρους δὲ τῶν λῃστῶν ἐκείνων τοὺς κύνας τουτουσί. οἱ μὲν γὰρ\r\nσυνειδότες αὑτοῖς οὕτω μοχθηρὸν τὸν βίον οὐ μᾶλλον διὰ τὸ τοῦ θανάτου δέος\r\nἢ τὴν αἰσχύνην τὰς ἐρημίας προβάλλονται, οἱ δ᾽ ἄρα περιπατοῦσιν(152) [C]\r\nἐν τῷ μέσῳ τὰ κοινὰ νόμιμα συγχέοντες, οὐχὶ τῷ κρείττονα καὶ καθαρωτέραν,\r\nἀλλὰ τῷ χείρονα καὶ βδελυρωτέραν ἐπεισάγειν πολιτείαν.\r\n\r\n(What better witness can you require for the desperate courage of bandits?\r\nExcept indeed that one might say that bandits are more courageous than\r\nCynics of this sort, while the Cynics are more reckless than they.

However, let him\r\ngo on to read the tragedies of Oenomaus—for he too wrote tragedies to\r\nmatch his discourses—and he will find that they are more inconceivably\r\ninfamous, that they transgress the very limits of evil; in fact I have no\r\nwords to describe them adequately, and in vain should I cite in comparison\r\nthe horrors of Magnesia,(156) the wickedness of Termerus(157) or the whole\r\nof tragedy put together, along with satiric drama, comedy and the mime:\r\nwith such art has their author displayed in those works every conceivable\r\nvileness and folly in their most extreme form. Now if from such works any\r\nman chooses to demonstrate to us the character of the Cynic philosophy,\r\nand to blaspheme the gods and bark at all men, as I said when I began, let\r\nhim go, let him depart to the uttermost parts of the earth whithersoever\r\nhe pleases. But if he do as the god enjoined on Diogenes, and first “give\r\na new stamp to the common currency,” then devote himself to the advice\r\nuttered earlier by the god, the precept “Know Thyself,” which Diogenes and\r\nCrates evidently followed in their actual practice, then I say that this\r\nis wholly worthy of one who desires to be a leader and a philosopher. For\r\nsurely we know what the god meant? He enjoined on Diogenes to despise the\r\nopinion of the crowd and to give a new stamp, not to truth, but to the\r\ncommon currency. Now to which of these categories shall we assign self‐\r\nknowledge? Can we call it common currency? Shall we not rather say that it\r\nis the very summary of truth, and by the injunction “Know Thyself” we are\r\ntold the way in which we must “give a new stamp to the common currency”?\r\nFor just as one who pays no regard whatever to conventional opinions but\r\ngoes straight for the truth will not decide his own conduct by those\r\nopinions but by actual facts, so I think he who knows himself will know\r\naccurately, not the opinion of others about him, but what he is in\r\nreality. It follows then, does it not? that the Pythian god speaks the\r\ntruth, and moreover that Diogenes was clearly convinced of this since he\r\nobeyed the god and so became, instead of an exile, I will not say greater\r\nthan the King of Persia, but according to the tradition handed down\r\nactually an object of envy to the man(158) who had broken the power of\r\nPersia and was rivalling the exploits of Heracles and ambitious to surpass\r\nAchilles. Then let us judge of the attitude of Diogenes towards gods and\r\nmen, not from the discourses of Oenomaus or the tragedies of Philiscus—who\r\nby ascribing their authorship to Diogenes grossly slandered that sacred\r\npersonage—but let us, I say, judge him by his deeds.)\r\n\r\nἮλθεν εἰς Ὀλυμπίαν ἐπὶ τί πρὸς Διός; ἵνα τοὺς ἀγωνιστὰς θεάσηται; τί δέ;\r\nοὐχὶ καὶ Ἰσθμίοις τοὺς αὐτοὺς καὶ Παναθηναίοις θεάσασθαι δίχα πραγμάτων\r\nοἷόν τε ἦν; ἀλλὰ ἐθέλων ἐκεῖ τοῖς κρατίστοις συγγενέσθαι τῶν Ἑλλήνων; [B]\r\nοὐ γὰρ Ἰσθμόνδε ἐφοίτων; οὐκ ἂν οὖν εὕροις ἄλλην αἰτίαν ἢ τὴν εἰς τὸν θεὸν\r\nθεραπείαν. εἰ δ᾽ οὐκ ἐξεπλάγη τὸν κεραυνὸν· οὐδὲ ἐγὼ μὰ τοὺς θεοὺς πολλῶν\r\nπολλάκις πειραθεὶς διοσημιῶν ἐξεπλάγην. ἀλλ᾽ ὅμως οὕτω δή τι τοὺς θεοὺς\r\nπέφρικα καὶ φιλῶ καὶ σέβω καὶ ἅζομαι καὶ πάνθ᾽ ἁπλῶς τὰ τοιαῦτα πρὸς\r\nαὐτοὺς πάσχω, ὅσαπερ ἄν τις καὶ οἷα πρὸς ἀγαθοὺς δεσπότας, πρὸς\r\nδιδασκάλους, πρὸς πατέρας, πρὸς κηδεμόνας, πρὸς πάντα ἁπλῶς τὰ τοιαῦτα,\r\n[C] ὥστε ὀλίγου δεῖν ὑπὸ τῶν σῶν ῥημάτων πρῴην ἐξανέστην. τοῦτο μὲν οὖν\r\nοὐκ οἶδ᾽ ὅντινα τρόπον ἐπελθὸν ἴσως σιωπᾶσθαι δέον ἐρρέθη.\r\n\r\n(Why in the name of Zeus did he go to Olympia? To see the athletes\r\ncompete? Nay, could he not have seen those very athletes without trouble\r\nboth at the Isthmian games and the Panathenaic festival? Then was it\r\nbecause he wished to meet there the most distinguished Greeks? But did\r\nthey not go to the Isthmus too? So you cannot discover any other motive\r\nthan that of doing honour to the god. He was not, you say, awestruck by a\r\nthunderstorm. Ye gods, I too have witnessed such signs from Zeus over and\r\nover again, without being awestruck! Yet for all that I feel awe of the\r\ngods, I love, I revere, I venerate them, and in short have precisely the\r\nsame feelings towards them as one would have towards kind masters(159) or\r\nteachers or fathers or guardians or any beings of that sort. That is the\r\nvery reason why I could hardly sit still the other day and listen to your\r\nspeech. However, I have spoken thus as I was somehow or other impelled to\r\nspeak, though perhaps it would have been better to say nothing at all.)\r\n\r\nΔιογένης δὲ καὶ πένης ὢν καὶ χρημάτων ἐνδεὴς εἰς Ὀλυμπίαν ἐβάδιζεν,\r\nἈλέξανδρον δὲ ἥκειν ἐκέλευε παρ᾽ ἑαυτόν, εἴ τῳ πιστὸς ὁ Δίων. οὕτω πρέπειν\r\nἐνόμιζεν ἑαυτῷ [D] μὲν φοιτᾶν ἐπὶ τὰ ἱερὰ τῶν θεῶν, τῷ βασιλικωτάτῳ δὲ τῶν\r\nκαθ᾽ ἑαυτὸν ἐπὶ τὴν ἑαυτοῦ συνουσίαν. ἃ δὲ πρὸς Ἀρχίδαμον γέγραφεν, οὐ\r\nβασιλικαὶ παραινέσεις εἰσίν; οὐ μόνον δὲ ἐν τοῖς λόγοις ἦν ὁ Διογένης\r\nθεοσεβής, ἀλλὰ γὰρ καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἔργοις. ἑλόμενον γὰρ αὐτὸν οἰκεῖν τὰς\r\nἈθήνας ἐπειδὴ τὸ δαιμόνιον εἰς τὴν Κόρινθον ἀπήγαγεν, ἀφεθεὶς ὑπὸ τοῦ\r\nπριαμένου τὴν πόλιν οὐκέτ᾽ ῴήθη δεῖν ἐκλιπεῖν· [213] ἐπέπειστο γὰρ αὑτοῦ\r\nτοῖς θεοῖς μέλειν εἴς τε τὴν Κόρινθον οὐ μάτην οὐδὲ κατά τινα συντυχίαν,\r\nτρόπον δέ τινα ὑπὸ τῶν θεῶν εἰσπεπέμφθαι ὁρῶν τὴν πόλιν τρυφῶσαν τῶν\r\nἈθηναίων μᾶλλον καὶ δεομένην μείζονος καὶ γενναιοτέρου σωφρονιστοῦ.\r\n\r\n(To return to Diogenes: he was poor and lacked means, yet he travelled to\r\nOlympia, though he bade Alexander come to him, if we are to believe\r\nDio.(160) So convinced was he that it was his duty to visit the temples of\r\nthe gods, but that it was the duty of the most royal monarch of that day\r\nto come to him for an interview. And was not that royal advice which he\r\nwrote to Archidamus? Nay, not only in words but in deeds also did Diogenes\r\nshow his reverence for the gods. For he preferred to live in Athens, but\r\nwhen the divine command had sent him away to Corinth, even after he had\r\nbeen set free by the man who had bought him, he did not think he ought to\r\nleave that city. For he believed that the gods took care of him, and that\r\nhe had been sent to Corinth, not at random or by some accident, but by the\r\ngods themselves for some purpose. He saw that Corinth was more luxurious\r\nthan Athens, and stood in need of a more severe and courageous reformer.)\r\n\r\nΤί δέ; οὐχὶ καὶ τοῦ Κράτητος μουσικὰ καὶ χαρίεντα φέρεται πολλὰ δείγματα\r\nτῆς πρὸς τοὺς θεοὺς ὁσιότητός τε καὶ εὐλαβείας; ἄκουε γοῦν αὐτὰ παρ᾽ ἡμῶν,\r\n[B] εἴ σοι μὴ σχολὴ γέγονε μαθεῖν ἐξ ἐκείνων αὐτά.\r\n\r\nTo give you another instance: Are there not extant many charming poems by\r\nCrates also which are proofs of his piety and veneration for the gods? I\r\nwill repeat them to you if you have not had time to learn this from the\r\npoems themselves:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Μνημοσύνης καὶ Ζηνὸς Ὀλυμπίου ἀγλαὰ τέκνα,\r\n      Μοῦσαι Πιερέδες, κλῦτέ μοι εὐχομένῳ·\r\n    Χόρτον ἐμῇ συνεχῆ δότε γαστέρι, καὶ δότε χωρίς\r\n      Δουλοσύνης, ἣ δὴ λιτὸν ἔθηκε βίον.\r\n\r\n    (“Ye Muses of Pieria, glorious children of Memory and Olympian\r\n    Zeus, grant me this prayer!

This then was the attitude of both those Cynics towards\r\nthe gods but they did not crowd audiences together to hear them, nor did\r\nthey entertain their friends with similes and myths, like the wise men of\r\nto‐day. For as Euripides well says,(168))\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ἁπλοῦς ὁ μῦθος τῆς ἀληθείας ἔφυ·\r\n\r\n    (“Simple and unadorned is the language of truth.”)\r\n\r\n\r\nσκιαγραφίας γάρ φησι τὸν ψευδῆ καὶ ἄδικον δεῖσθαι. τίς οὖν ὁ τρόπος αὐτοῖς\r\nτῆς συνουσίας ἐγίνετο; τῶν λόγων ἡγεῖτο τὰ ἔργα, καὶ οἱ τὴν πενίαν\r\nτιμῶντες αὐτοὶ πρῶτοι φαίνονται(169) καὶ τῶν πατρῴων χρημάτων ὑπεριδόντες,\r\nοἱ τὴν ἀτυφίαν ἀσπασάμενοι πρῶτοι [C] τὴν εὐτέλειαν ἤσκουν διὰ πάντων, οἱ\r\nτὸ τραγικὸν καὶ σοβαρὸν ἐκ τῶν ἀλλοτρίων ἐξαιροῦντες βίων ᾤκουν αὐτοὶ\r\nπρῶτοι τὰς ἀγορὰς ἢ τὰ τῶν θεῶν τεμένη, τῇ τρυφῇ δὲ καὶ πρὸ τῶν ῥημάτων\r\nδιὰ τῶν ἔργων ἐπολέμουν, ἔργοις ἐλέγχοντες, οὐ λόγῳ βοῶντες, ὅτι τῷ Διὶ\r\nσυμβασιλεύειν ἔξεστιν οὐδενὸς ἢ σμικρῶν πάνυ δεόμενον οὐδὲ παρενοχλούμενον\r\nὑπὸ τοῦ σώματος, ἐπετίμων δὲ τοῖς ἁμαρτάνουσιν, ἡνίκα ἔζων οἱ πταίσαντες,\r\n[D] οὐκ ἀποθανόντας ἐβλασφήμουν, ἡνίκα καὶ τῶν ἐχθρῶν οἱ μετριώτεροι\r\nσπένδονται τοῖς ἀπελθοῦσιν. ἔχει δὲ ὅ γε ἀληθινὸς κύων ἐχθρὸν οὐδένα, κἂν\r\nτὸ σωμάτιον αὐτοῦ τις πατάξῃ, κἂν τοὔνομα περιέλκῃ, κἂν λοιδορῆται καὶ\r\nβλασφημῇ, διότι τὸ μὲν τῆς ἔχθρας γίνεται πρὸς ἀντίπαλον, τὸ δὲ ὑπερβαῖνον\r\nτὴν πρὸς ἕτερον ἅμιλλαν εὐνοίᾳ τιμᾶσθαι φιλεῖ· [215] κἄν τις ἑτέρως ἔχῃ\r\nπρὸς αὐτὸν, καθάπερ οἶμαι πολλοὶ πρὸς τοὺς θεούς, ἐκείνῳ μὲν οὐκ ἔστιν\r\nἐχθρός, οὐδὲ γὰρ βλαβερός, αὐτὸς δὲ αὑτῷ βαρύτατον ἐπιτιθεὶς(170) τίμημα\r\nτὴν τοῦ κρείττονος ἄγνοιαν ἔρημος λείπεται τῆς ἐκείνου προστασίας.\r\n\r\n(Only the liar and the dishonest man, he says, have any use for a\r\nmysterious and allusive style. Now what was the manner of their\r\nintercourse with men? Deeds with them came before words, and if they\r\nhonoured poverty they themselves seem first to have scorned inherited\r\nwealth; if they cultivated modesty, they themselves first practised plain\r\nliving in every respect; if they tried to expel from the lives of other\r\nmen the element of theatrical display and arrogance, they themselves first\r\nset the example by living in the open market places and the temple\r\nprecincts, and they opposed luxury by their own practice before they did\r\nso in words; nor did they shout aloud but proved by their actions that a\r\nman may rule as the equal of Zeus if he needs nothing or very little and\r\nso is not hampered by his body; and they reproved sinners during the\r\nlifetime of those who had offended but did not speak ill of the dead; for\r\nwhen men are dead even their enemies, at least the more moderate, make\r\npeace with the departed. But the genuine Cynic has no enemy, even though\r\nmen strike his feeble body or drag his name in the mire, or slander and\r\nspeak ill of him, because enmity is felt only towards an opponent, but\r\nthat which is above personal rivalry is usually loved and respected. But\r\nif anyone is hostile to a Cynic, as indeed many are even to the gods, he\r\nis not that Cynic’s enemy, since he cannot injure him; rather he inflicts\r\non himself the most terrible punishment of all, namely ignorance of one\r\nwho is nobler than himself; and so he is deserted and bereft of the\r\nother’s protection.)\r\n\r\nἈλλ᾽ εἰ μὲν νῦν μοι προύκειτο περὶ Κυνισμοῦ γράφειν, [B] εἶπον ἂν ὑπὲρ\r\nτούτων ἔτι τὰ παριστάμενά μοι τῶν εἰρημένων ἴσως οὐκ ἐλάττω· νῦν δὲ\r\nἀποδιδόντες τὸ συνεχὲς τῇ προαιρέσει περὶ τοῦ ποταποὺς εἶναι χρὴ τοὺς\r\nπλαττομένους τῶν μύθων ἐφεξῆς σκοπῶμεν. ἴσως δὲ ἡγεῖται καὶ ταύτης τῆς\r\nἐγχειρήσεως ἐκείνη, ὁποίᾳ τινὶ φιλοσοφίᾳ προσῆκον ἡ μυθογραφία. φαίνονται\r\nγὰρ πολλοὶ καὶ τῶν φιλοσόφων αὐτὸ καὶ τῶν θεολόγων ποιήσαντες, ὥσπερ\r\nὈρφεὺς μὲν ὁ παλαιότατος ἐνθέως φιλοσοφήσας, οὐκ ὀλίγοι δὲ καὶ τῶν μετ᾽\r\nἐκεῖνον· οὐ μὴν ἀλλὰ [C] καὶ Ξενοφῶν φαίνεται καὶ Ἀντισθένης καὶ Πλάτων\r\nπροσχρησάμενοι πολλαχοῦ τοῖς μύθοις, ὥσθ᾽ ἡμῖν πέφηνεν, εἰ καὶ μὴ τῷ\r\nΚυνικῷ, φιλοσόφῳ γοῦν τινι προσήκειν ἡ μυθογραφία.\r\n\r\n(Now if my present task were to write about the Cynic philosophy, I could\r\nadd many details about the Cynics, not less important than what I have\r\nsaid already.

But\r\nperhaps another inquiry should precede this attempt, I mean to what branch\r\nof philosophy the composition of myths is appropriate. For we see that\r\nmany philosophers and theologians too have employed it, Orpheus for\r\ninstance, the most ancient of all the inspired philosophers, and many\r\nbesides of those that came after him. Nay what is more, Xenophon as we\r\nknow and Antisthenes and Plato often introduced myths, so that it is\r\nobvious that even if the use of myth be not appropriate for the Cynic,\r\nstill it may be so for some other type of philosopher.)\r\n\r\nΜικρὰ οὖν ὑπὲρ τῶν τῆς φιλοσοφίας εἴτε μορίων εἴτε ἐργάνων\r\nπρορρητέον.(171) ἔστι γὰρ οὐ μέγα τὸ διαφέρον ὁποτέρως ἄν τις τῷ\r\nπρακτικῷ(172) [D] καὶ τῷ φυσικῷ τὸ λογικὸν προσαριθμῇ· ἀναγκαῖον γὰρ\r\nὁμοίως φαίνεται κατ᾽ ἀμφότερα. τριῶν δὴ τούτων αὖθις ἕκαστον εἰς τρία\r\nτέμνεται, τὸ μὲν φυσικὸν εἰς τὸ θεολογικὸν καὶ τὸ περὶ τὰ μαθήματα καὶ\r\nτρίτον τὸ περὶ τὴν τῶν γινομένων καὶ ἀπολλυμένων καὶ τῶν ἀιδίων μέν,\r\nσωμάτων δὲ ὅμως θεωρίαν, τί τὸ εἶναι αὐτοῖς καὶ τίς ἡ οὐσία ἑκάστου· τοῦ\r\nπρακτικοῦ δὲ τὸ μὲν πρὸς ἕνα ἄνδρα, ἠθικόν, οἰκονομικὸν δὲ τὸ περὶ μίαν\r\nοἰκίαν, πολιτικὸν δὲ τὸ περὶ πόλιν· ἔτι μέντοι τοῦ λογικοῦ τὸ μὲν\r\nἀποδεικτικὸν διὰ τῶν ἀληθῶν, τὸ δὲ διὰ τῶν ἐνδόξων βιαστικόν, [216] τὸ δὲ\r\nδιὰ τῶν φαινομένων ἐνδόξων παραλογιστικόν. ὄντων δὴ τοσούτων τῶν τῆς\r\nφιλοσοφίας μερῶν, εἰ μή τί με λέληθε· καὶ οὐδὲν θαυμαστὸν ἄνδρα στρατιώτην\r\nμὴ λίαν ἐξακριβοῦν μηδ᾽ ἐξονυχίζειν τὰ τοιαῦτα, ἅτε οὐκ ἐκ βιβλίων\r\nἀσκήσεως, ἀπὸ δὲ τῆς προστυχούσης αὐτὰ ἕξεως ἀποφθεγγόμενον· ἔσεσθε γοῦν\r\nμοι καὶ ὑμεῖς μάρτυρες, εἰ τὰς ἡμέρας λογίσαισθε,(173) πόσαι τινές εἰσιν\r\nαἱ μεταξὺ ταύτης τε καὶ τῆς ἔναγχος ἡμῖν γενομένης ἀκροάσεως ὅσων τε ἡμῖν\r\nἀσχολιῶν πλήρεις· [B] ἀλλ᾽ ὅπερ ἔφην, εἰ καί τι παραλέλειπται παρ᾽ ἐμοῦ·\r\nκαίτοι νομίζω γε μηδὲν ἐνδεῖν· πλὴν ὁ προστιθεὶς οὐκ ἐχθρός, ἀλλὰ φίλος\r\nἔσται.\r\n\r\n(I must first then say a few words about the subdivisions or instruments\r\nof philosophy. It does not make much difference in which of two ways one\r\nreckons logic, whether with practical or natural philosophy, since it is\r\nequally necessary to both these branches. But I will consider these as\r\nthree separate branches and assign to each one three subdivisions. Natural\r\nphilosophy consists of theology, mathematics, and thirdly the study of\r\nthis world of generation and decay and things that though imperishable are\r\nnevertheless matter, and deals with their essential nature and their\r\nsubstance in each case. Practical philosophy again consists of ethics in\r\nso far as it deals with the individual man, economics when it deals with\r\nthe household as a unit, politics when it deals with the state. Logic,\r\nagain, is demonstrative in so far as it deals with the truth of\r\nprinciples; polemic when it deals with general opinions; eristic when it\r\ndeals with opinions that only seem probabilities. These then are the\r\ndivisions of philosophy, if I mistake not. Though indeed it would not be\r\nsurprising that a mere soldier should be none too exact in these matters\r\nor not have them at his fingers’ ends, seeing that I speak less from book‐\r\nknowledge than from observation and experience. For that matter you can\r\nyourselves bear me witness thereto, if you count up how few days have\r\nelapsed between the lecture that we lately heard and to‐day, and moreover\r\nthe number of affairs with which they have been filled for me. But as I\r\nsaid if I have omitted anything—though I do not think I have—still if\r\nanyone can make my classification more complete he will be “no enemy but\r\nmy friend.”(174))\r\n\r\nΤούτων δὴ τῶν μερῶν οὔτε τῷ λογικῷ προσήκει τῆς μυθογραφίας οὔτε τοῦ\r\nφυσικοῦ(175) τῷ μαθηματικῷ, μόνον δέ, εἴπερ ἄρα, τοῦ πρακτικοῦ τῷ πρὸς ἕνα\r\nγινομένῳ καὶ τοῦ θεολογικοῦ τῷ τελεστικῷ καὶ μυστικῷ· [C] φιλεῖ γὰρ ἡ\r\nφύσις κρύπτεσθαι, καὶ τὸ ἀποκεκρυμμένον τῆς τῶν θεῶν οὐσίας οὐκ ἀνέχεται\r\nγυμνοῖς εἰς ἀκαθάρτους ἀκοὰς ῥίπτεσθαι ῥήμασιν. ὅπερ δὲ δὴ τῶν χαρακτήρων\r\nἡ ἀπόρρητος φύσις ὠφελεῖν πέφυκε καὶ ἀγνοουμένη· θεραπεύει γοῦν οὐ ψυχὰς\r\nμόνον, ἀλλὰ καὶ σώματα, καὶ θεῶν ποιεῖ παρουσίας· τοῦτ᾽ οἶμαι πολλάκις\r\nγίγνεσθαι καὶ διὰ τῶν μύθων, [D] ὅταν εἰς τὰς τῶν πολλῶν ἀκοὰς οὐ\r\nδυναμένας τὰ θεῖα καθαρῶς δέξασθαι δι᾽ αἰνιγμάτων αὐτοῖς μετὰ τῆς μύθων\r\nσκηνοποιίας ἐγχέηται.\r\n\r\n(Now of these branches of philosophy, logic has no concern with the\r\ncomposition of myths; nor has mathematics, the sub‐division of natural\r\nphilosophy; but they may be employed, if at all, by that department of\r\npractical philosophy which deals with the individual man, and by that\r\ndepartment of theology which has to do with initiation and the Mysteries.\r\nFor nature loves to hide her secrets,(176) and she does not suffer the\r\nhidden truth about the essential nature of the gods to be flung in naked\r\nwords to the ears of the profane. Now there are certain characteristics of\r\nours that derive benefit from that occult and unknown nature, which\r\nnourishes not our souls alone but our bodies also, and brings us into the\r\npresence of the gods, and this I think often comes about by means of\r\nmyths; when through riddles and the dramatic setting of myths that\r\nknowledge is insinuated into the ears of the multitude who cannot receive\r\ndivine truths in their purest form.)\r\n\r\nΦανεροῦ δὲ ἤδη γενομένου τίνι καὶ ποίῳ φιλοσοφίας εἴδει καὶ μυθογραφεῖν\r\nἔσθ᾽ ὅτε προσήκει· πρὸς γὰρ τῷ λόγῳ μαρτυρεῖ τούτοις ἡ τῶν προλαβόντων\r\nἀνδρῶν προαίρεσις. ἐπεὶ καὶ Πλάτωνι πολλὰ μεμυθολόγηται περὶ τῶν ἐν ᾅδου\r\nπραγμάτων θεολογοῦντι καὶ πρό γε τούτου τῷ τῆς Καλλιόπης, [217] Ἀντισθένει\r\nδὲ καὶ Ξενοφῶντι καὶ αὐτῷ Πλάτωνι πραγματευομένοις ἠθικάς τινας ὑποθέσεις\r\nοὐ παρέργως, ἀλλὰ μετά τινος ἐμμελείας ἡ τῶν μύθων ἐγκαταμέμικται γραφή,\r\nοὓς σ᾽(177) ἐχρῆν, εἴπερ ἐβούλου, μιμούμενον ἀντὶ μὲν Ἡρακλέους\r\nμεταλαμβάνειν Περσέως ἢ Θησέως τινὸς ὄνομα καὶ τὸν Ἀντισθένειον τύπον\r\nἐγχαράττειν, ἁντὶ δὲ τῆς Προδίκου σκηνοποιιας ἀμφὶ τοῖν ἀμφοῖν [B] τούτοιν\r\nθεοῖν ἑτέραν ὁμοίαν εἰσάγειν εἰς τὸ θέατρον.\r\n\r\n(It is now evident what branch and what sort of philosophy may properly on\r\noccasion employ myths. And to support my argument I call to witness the\r\nauthority of those philosophers who were the first to use myths. Plato for\r\ninstance in his theological descriptions of life in Hades often uses\r\nmyths, and the son(178) of Calliope before him. And when Antisthenes and\r\nXenophon and Plato himself discuss certain ethical theories they use myths\r\nas one of the ingredients, and not casually but of set purpose. Now if you\r\ntoo wished to use myths you ought to have imitated these philosophers, and\r\ninstead of Heracles you should have introduced the name of Perseus or\r\nTheseus, let us say, and have written in the style of Antisthenes; and in\r\nplace of the dramatic setting used by Prodicus,(179) in treating of those\r\ntwo gods(180) you should have introduced into your theatre another setting\r\nof the same sort.)\r\n\r\nἘπεὶ δὲ καὶ τῶν τελεστικῶν μύθων ἐπεμνήσθην, φέρε νῦν ὁποίους εἶναι χρὴ\r\nτοὺς ἑκατέρῳ τῶν μερῶν ἁρμόττοντας αὐτοὶ καθ᾽ ἑαυτοὺς ἰδεῖν πειραθῶμεν,\r\nοὐκέτι μαρτύρων παλαιῶν ἐν πᾶσι προσδεόμενοι, ἑπόμενοι δὲ νέοις ἴχνεσιν\r\nἀνδρός, ὃν ἐγὼ μετὰ τοὺς θεοὺς ἐξ ἴσης Ἀριστοτέλει καὶ Πλάτωνι ἄγαμαί τε\r\nτέθηπά τε.

He does not treat of all kinds of myths but only those connected\r\nwith initiation into the Mysteries, such as Orpheus, the founder of the\r\nmost sacred of all the Mysteries, handed down to us. For it is the\r\nincongruous element in myths that guides us to the truth.(183) I mean that\r\nthe more paradoxical and prodigious the riddle is the more it seems to\r\nwarn us not to believe simply the bare words but rather to study\r\ndiligently the hidden truth, and not to relax our efforts until under the\r\nguidance of the gods those hidden things become plain, and so initiate or\r\nrather perfect our intelligence or whatever we possess that is more\r\nsublime than the intelligence, I mean that small particle of the One and\r\nthe Good which contains the whole indivisibly, the complement of the soul,\r\nand in the One and the Good comprehends the whole of soul itself through\r\nthe prevailing and separate and distinct presence of the One. But I was\r\nimpelled I know not how to rave with his own sacred frenzy when I spoke\r\nlike this of the attributes of great Dionysus(184); and now I set an ox on\r\nmy tongue:(185) for I may not reveal what is too sacred for speech.\r\nHowever, may the gods grant to me and to many of you who have not as yet\r\nbeen initiated into these Mysteries to enjoy the blessings thereof!)\r\n\r\nὙπὲρ δὲ ὧν εἰπεῖν τε καὶ ἀκοῦσαι θέμις καὶ ἀνεμέσητον ἀμφοτέροις ἐστὶ, πᾶς\r\nλόγος ὁ προφερόμενος ἔκ τε λέξεως καὶ διανοίας σύγκειται. οὐκοῦν ἐπειδὴ\r\nκαὶ ὁ μῦθος λόγος τίς ἐστιν, [B] ἐκ δυοῖν τούτοιν συγκείσεται. σκοπῶμεν δὲ\r\nἑκάτερον αὐτῶν. ἔστιν ἁπλῆ τις ἐν λόγῳ παντὶ διάνοια, καὶ μέντοι καὶ κατὰ\r\nσχῆμα προάγεται, τὰ παραδείγματα δὲ ἀμφοῖν ἐστι πολλά. τὸ μὲν οὖν ἓν\r\nἁπλοῦν ἐστι καὶ οὐδὲν δεῖται ποικιλίας, τὸ δ᾽ ἐσχηματισμένον ἔχει διαφορὰς\r\nἐν ἑαυτῷ πολλάς, ὧν, εἴ τί σοι τῆς ῥητορικῆς ἐμέλησεν, οὐκ ἀξύνετος εἶ.\r\nτούτων δὴ τῶν κατὰ διάνοιαν σχημάτων ἁρμόττει τῷ μύθῳ τὰ πλεῖστα· πλὴν\r\nἔμοιγε οὔθ᾽ ὑπὲρ τῶν πολλῶν οὔθ᾽ ὑπὲρ τῶν ἁπάντων ἐστὶ τά γε νῦν ῥητέον,\r\nἀλλ᾽ ὑπὲρ δυοῖν, τοῦ τε σεμνοῦ κατὰ τὴν διάνοιαν καὶ τοῦ ἀπεμφαίνοντος.\r\n[C] τὰ δὲ αὐτὰ ταῦτα καὶ περὶ τὴν λέξιν γίνεται. μορφοῦται γάρ πως καὶ\r\nσχηματίζεται παρὰ τῶν μὴ προφερομένων εἰκῇ μηδ᾽ ὥσπερ χειμάρρους ἑλκόντων\r\nσυρφετοὺς ῥημάτων ἐκ τῆς τριόδου· ἀλλὰ τοῖν δυοῖν τούτοιν, ὅταν μὲν ὑπὲρ\r\nτῶν θείων πλάττωμεν, σεμνὰ χρὴ πάνυ τὰ ῥήματα εἶναι καὶ τὴν λέξιν ὡς ἔνι\r\nμάλιστα σώφρονα καὶ καλὴν καὶ τοῖς θεοῖς πρεπωδεστάτην, τῶν αἰσχρῶν [D] δὲ\r\nμηδὲν καὶ βλασφήμων ἢ δυσσεβῶν, ὅπως μὴ τῷ πλήθει τῆς τοιαύτης ἀρχηγοὶ\r\nθρασύτητος γενώμεθα, μᾶλλον δὲ καὶ πρὸ τοῦ πλήθους αὐτοὶ τὸ περὶ τοὺς\r\nθεοὺς ἠσεβηκέναι προλάβωμεν. οὐδὲν οὖν ἀπεμφαῖνον εἶναι χρὴ περὶ τὰς\r\nτοιαύτας λέξεις, ἀλλὰ σεμνὰ πάντα καὶ καλὰ καὶ μεγαλοπρεπῆ καὶ θεῖα καὶ\r\nκαθαρὰ καὶ τῆς τῶν θεῶν οὐσίας εἰς δύναμιν ἐστοχασμένα· [219] τὸ δὲ κατὰ\r\nτὴν διάνοιαν ἀπεμφαῖνον τοῦ χρησίμου γιγνόμενον χάριν ἐγκριτέον, ὡς ἂν μή\r\nτινος ὑπομνήσεως ἔξωθεν οἱ ἄνθρωποι δεόμενοι, ἀλλ᾽ ὑπὸ τῶν ἐν αὐτῷ\r\nλεγομένων τῷ μύθῳ διδασκόμενοι τὸ λανθάνον μῶσθαι καὶ πολυπραγμονεῖν ὑφ᾽\r\nἡγεμόσι τοῖς θεοῖς προθυμηθεῖεν. ἰδοῦ γὰρ ἔγωγε πολλῶν ἤκουσα λεγόντων\r\nἄνθρωπον μὲν τὸν Διόνυσον, ἐπείπερ ἐκ Σεμέλης ἐγένετο, θεὸν δὲ διὰ\r\nθεουργίας [B] καὶ τελεστικῆς, ὥσπερ τὸν δεσπότην Ἡρακλέα διὰ τῆς βασιλικῆς\r\nἀρετῆς εἰς τὸν Ὄλυμπον ὑπὸ τοῦ πατρὸς ἀνῆχθαι τοῦ Διός. ἀλλ᾽, ὦ τάν,\r\nεἶπον, οὐ ξυνίετε τοῦ μύθου φανερῶς αἰνιττομένου. ποῦ γὰρ ἡ γένεσίς ἐστιν\r\nὥσπερ Ἡρακλέους, οὕτω δὴ(186) καὶ Διονύσου, ἔχουσα μὲν τὸ κρεῖττον καὶ\r\nὑπερέχον καὶ ἐξῃρημένον, ἐν τῷ μετρίῳ δὲ ὅμως ἔτι τῆς ἀνθρωπίνης φύσεως\r\nμένουσα καί [C] πως ἀφομοιουμένη πρὸς ἡμᾶς; Ἡρακλὴς δὲ λέγεται παιδίον\r\nγενέσθαι καὶ κατὰ μικρὸν αὐτῷ τὸ σῶμα τὸ θεῖον ἐπιδοῦναι, καὶ φοιτῆσαι\r\nδιδασκάλοις ἱστόρηται, καὶ στρατεύσασθαι λέγεται καὶ κρατῆσαι πάντων,\r\nκαμεῖν δὲ ὅμως κατὰ(187) τὸ σῶμα. καίτοι αὐτῷ ταῦτα μὲν ὑπῆρξε, μειζόνως\r\nδὲ ἢ κατ᾽ ἄνθρωπον. ὅτε γὰρ ἐν τοῖς σπαργάνοις ἀποπνίγων τοὺς δράκοντας\r\nκαὶ πρὸς αὐτὰ παραταττόμενος τὰ τῆς φύσεως στοιχεῖα, θάλπη καὶ κρυμούς,\r\n[D] εἶτα τοῖς ἀπορωτάτοις καὶ ἀμαχωτάτοις, ἐνδείᾳ λέγω τροφῆς καὶ ἐρημίᾳ,\r\nκαὶ τὴν δι᾽ αὐτοῦ πορείαν οἶμαι τοῦ πελάγους ἐπὶ τῆς χρυσῆς κύλικος, ἣν\r\nἐγὲ νομίζω μὰ τοὺς θεοὺς οὐ κύλικα εἶναι, βαδίσαι δὲ αὐτὸν ὡς ἐπὶ ξηρᾶς\r\nτῆς θαλάττης νενόμικα. τὶ γὰρ ἄπορον ἦν Ἡρακλεῖ; τί δ᾽ οὐχ ὑπήκουσεν αὐτοῦ\r\nτῷ θείῳ καὶ καθαρωτάτῳ σώματι, τῶν λεγομένων τούτων στοιχείων δουλευόντων\r\nαὐτοῦ τῇ δημιουργικῇ [220] καὶ τελεσιουργῷ τοῦ ἀχράντου καὶ καθαροῦ νοῦ\r\nδυνάμει; ὃν ὁ μέγας Ζεὺς διὰ τῆς Προνοίας Ἀθηνᾶς, ἐπιστήσας αὐτῷ φύλακα\r\nτὴν θεὸν ταύτην, ὅλην ἐξ ὅλου προέμενος αὑτοῦ,(188) τῷ κόσμῳ σωτῆρα\r\nἐφύτευσεν, εἶτ᾽ ἐπανήγαγε διὰ τοῦ κεραυνίου πυρὸς πρὸς ἑαυτόν, ὑπὸ τῷ θείῳ\r\nσυνθήματι τῆς αἰθερίας αὐγῆς ἥκειν παρ᾽ ἑαυτὸν τῷ παιδὶ κελεύσας. ἀλλ᾽\r\nὑπὲρ μὲν τούτων ἐμοί τε καὶ ὑμῖν ἵλεως Ἡρακλῆς εἴη.\r\n\r\n(And now to confine myself to what is lawful for us, both for me to say\r\nand for you to hear. Every discourse that is uttered consists of language\r\nand the thought to be expressed. Now a myth is a sort of discourse and so\r\nit will consist of these two. Let us consider them separately. In every\r\ndiscourse the thought is of two kinds, either simple or expressed in\r\nfigures of speech; and there are many examples of both kinds. The one is\r\nsimple and admits of no variety, but that which is embellished with\r\nfigures has in itself many possibilities of variation with all of which\r\nyou are yourself familiar if you have ever studied rhetoric; and most of\r\nthese figures of thought are suited to myth. However I need not now\r\ndiscuss all or indeed many of them, but only two, that in which the\r\nthought is dignified and that in which it is paradoxical. The same rules\r\napply also to diction. For this is given a certain shape and form by those\r\nwho do not express themselves carelessly or sweep in the refuse of\r\nlanguage from the highways like a winter torrent. And now to consider\r\nthese two types. When we invent myths about sacred things our language\r\nmust be wholly dignified and the diction must be as far as possible sober,\r\nbeautiful, and entirely appropriate to the gods; there must be nothing in\r\nit base or slanderous or impious, for fear we should lead the common\r\npeople into this sort of sacrilegious rashness; or rather for fear we\r\nshould ourselves anticipate the common people in displaying impiety\r\ntowards the gods. Therefore there must be no incongruous element in\r\ndiction thus employed, but all must be dignified, beautiful, splendid,\r\ndivine, pure, and as far as possible in conformity with the essential\r\nnature of the gods. But as regards the thought, the incongruous may be\r\nadmitted, so that under the guidance of the gods men may be inspired to\r\nsearch out and study the hidden meaning, though they must not ask for any\r\nhint of the truth from others, but must acquire their knowledge from what\r\nis said in the myth itself.(189) For instance I have heard many people say\r\nthat Dionysus was a mortal man because he was born of Semele, and that he\r\nbecame a god through his knowledge of theurgy and the Mysteries, and like\r\nour lord Heracles for his royal virtue was translated to Olympus by his\r\nfather Zeus. “Nay, my good sir,” said I, “do you not perceive that the\r\nmyth is obviously an allegory?” For in what sense do we regard the “birth”\r\nof Heracles, yes, and of Dionysus as well, since in their case birth has\r\nsuperior and surpassing and distinctive elements, even though it still\r\nfalls within the limits of human nature, and up to a certain point\r\nresembles our own? Heracles for instance is said to have been a child,\r\neven as we are; his divine body grew gradually; we are informed that he\r\nwas instructed by teachers;(190) they say that he carried on wars and\r\ndefeated all his opponents, but for all that his body had to endure\r\nweariness. And in fact all this did in his case occur, but on a scale\r\ngreater than human. For instance, while still in swaddling clothes he\r\nstrangled the serpents and then opposed himself to the very elements of\r\nnature, the extremes of heat and cold and things the most difficult and\r\nhardest to contend with, I mean lack of food and loneliness;(191) and then\r\nthere is his journey over the sea itself in a golden cup,(192) though, by\r\nthe gods, I do not think it was really a cup, but my belief is that he\r\nhimself walked on the sea as though it were dry land.(193) For what was\r\nimpossible to Heracles? Which was there of the so‐called elements that did\r\nnot obey his divine and most pure body since they were subdued to the\r\ncreative and perfecting force of his stainless and pure intelligence? For\r\nhim did mighty Zeus, with the aid of Athene goddess of Forethought, beget\r\nto be the saviour of the world, and appointed as his guardian this goddess\r\nwhom he had brought forth whole from the whole of himself; and later on he\r\ncalled him to his side through the flame of a thunderbolt, thus bidding\r\nhis son to come to him by the divine signal of the ethereal rays of light.\r\nNow when we meditate on this, may Heracles be gracious to you and to me!)\r\n\r\nΤὰ δὲ τῆς Διονύσου θρυλουμένης μὲν γενέσεως, οὔσης δὲ οὐ γενέσεως, [B]\r\nἀλλὰ δαιμονίας ἐκφάνσεως κατὰ τί τοῖς ἀνθρωπικοῖς προσέοικεν; ἡ μήτηρ\r\nαὐτὸν κύουσα, φασίν, ὑπὸ τῆς Ἥρας ζηλοτυπούσης ἐξαπατηθεῖσα τὸν ἐραστὴν\r\nἐξελιπάρησεν ἥκειν, ὡς παρὰ τὴν γαμετὴν εἴωθε φοιτᾶν, πρὸς ἑαυτήν· εἶτα\r\nοὐκ ἀνασχόμενον τὸ σωμάτιον τῶν κτυπημάτων(194) τοῦ Διὸς ὑπὸ τοῦ κεραυνοῦ\r\nκατεφλέγετο. πάντων δ᾽ ὁμοῦ πυρουμένων, Ἑρμῇ κελεύσας ὁ Ζεὺς ἁρπάσαι τὸν\r\nΔιόνυσον καὶ τεμὼν τὸν αὑτοῦ μηρὸν ἐρράπτει· εἶτα ἐκεῖθεν, ἡνίκα\r\nἐτελεσφορήθη τὸ βρέφος, [C] ὠδίνων ὁ Ζεὺς ἐπὶ τὰς νύμφας ἔρχεται· τὸ Λῦθι\r\nῥάμμα δὲ αὗται τῷ μηρῷ προσεπᾴδουσαι τὸν διθύραμβον ἡμῖν εῖς φῶς\r\nπροήγαγον· εἶτα ἐμάνη, φασίν, ὁ θεὸς ὑπὸ τῆς Ἥρας, ἔπαυσε δ᾽ αὐτῷ τὴν\r\nνόσον ἡ Μήτηρ τῶν θεῶν, ὁ δὲ ἦν αὐτίκα θεός. εἵποντο γοῦν οὐ Λίχας αὐτῷ\r\nκαθάπερ Ἡρακλεῖ οὐδὲ Ἰόλεως οὐδὲ Τελαμὼν οὐδ᾽ Ὕλας οὐδ᾽ Ἄβδηρος, ἀλλὰ\r\nΣάτυροι καὶ Βακχαὶ [D] καὶ Πᾶνες καὶ δαιμόνων στρατιά. ὁρᾷς ὅπως ἀνθρωπικὴ\r\nμὲν ἡ σπορὰ διὰ τῶν κεραυνίων, ἡ δ᾽ ἀποκύησις ἀνθρωπικωτέρα, ἀμφοῖν δὲ\r\nτοῖν εἰρημένοιν προσομοιότερα τοῖς ἀνθρωπίνοις τὰ ἔργα; τί οὖν οὐ\r\nκαταβάλλοντες τὸν λῆρον ἐκεῖνο πρῶτον ὑπὲρ τούτων ἴσμεν, ὡς Σεμέλη σοφὴ τὰ\r\nθεῖα; παῖς γὰρ ἦν Κάδμου τοῦ Φοίνικος, τούτοις δὲ καὶ ὁ θεὸς σοφίαν\r\nμαρτυρεῖ\r\n\r\n(As for the commonly received legend about the birth of Dionysus, which\r\nwas in fact no birth but a divine manifestation, in what respect was it\r\nlike the birth of men? While he was still in his mother’s womb she, as the\r\nstory goes, was beguiled by jealous Hera to entreat her lover to visit her\r\nas he was wont to visit his spouse. And then her frail body could not\r\nendure the thunders of Zeus and began to be consumed by the lightning. But\r\nwhen everything there was being devoured by flames, Zeus bade Hermes\r\nsnatch Dionysus forth, and he cut open his own thigh and sewed the babe\r\ntherein.(195) Then in due course when the time was ripe for the child’s\r\nbirth, Zeus in the pangs of travail came to the nymphs, and they by their\r\nsong over the thigh “Undo the stitching”(196) brought to light for us the\r\ndithyramb. Whereupon the god was driven mad by Hera, but the Mother of the\r\nGods healed him of his sickness and he straightway became a god. And he\r\nhad for followers not, like Heracles, Lichas for instance or Iolaus or\r\nTelamon or Hylas or Abderos, but Satyrs, Bacchanals, Pans and a whole host\r\nof lesser divinities. Do you perceive how much of human there is in this\r\ngeneration through the fire of a thunderbolt, that his delivery is even\r\nmore human, and that his deeds, even more than these two that we have\r\nmentioned, resemble those of human beings? Now why do we not set aside all\r\nthis nonsense and recognise herein first the fact that Semele was wise in\r\nsacred things? For she was the daughter of Phoenician Cadmus, and the god\r\nhimself bears witness to the wisdom of the Phoenicians(197) when he says)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Πολλὰς καὶ Φοίνικες ὁδοὺς μακάρων ἐδάησαν\r\n\r\n    (“The Phoenicians too have learned many of the roads travelled by\r\n    the blessed gods.”(198))\r\n\r\n\r\nλέγων. [221] αἰσθέσθαι οὖν μοι δοκεῖ τοῦ θεοῦ τούτου πρώτη παρ᾽ Ἕλλησι καὶ\r\nτὴν ἐσομένην ἐπιφάνειαν αὐτοῦ οὐκ εἰς μακρὰν προαγορεύσασα κινῆσαι μὲν\r\nθᾶττον ἢ προσῆκον ἦν τινὰ τῶν περὶ αὐτὸν ὀργίων, οὐκ ἀνασχομένη τὸν\r\nεἱμαρμένον περιμεῖναι χρόνον, εἶτα ἀναλωθῆναι πρὸς τοῦ πυρὸς τοῦ ῥυέντος\r\nἐπ᾽ αὐτήν. ἐπεὶ δὲ ἐδέδοκτο τῷ Διὶ κοινῇ πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις ἐνδοῦναι ἀρχὴν\r\nκαταστάσεως ἑτέρας καὶ μεταβαλεῖν(199) αὐτοὺς ἐκ τοῦ νομαδικοῦ βίου πρὸς\r\n[B] τὸν ἡμερώτερον, ἐξ Ἰνδῶν ὁ Διόνυσος αὔτοπτος ἐφαίνετο δαίμων,\r\nἐπιφοιτῶν τὰς πόλεις, ἄγων μεθ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ στρατιὰν πολλὴν δαιμονίων\r\nτινῶν(200) καὶ διδοὺς ἀνθρώποις κοινῇ μὲν ἅπασι σύμβολον τῆς ἐπιφανείας\r\nαὐτοῦ τὸ τῆς ἡμερίδος φυτόν, ὑφ᾽ οὗ μοι δοκοῦσιν, ἐξημερωθέντων αὐτοῖς τῶν\r\nπερὶ τὸν βίον, Ἕλληνες τῆς ἐπωνυμίας αὐτὸ ταύτης ἀξιῶσαι, μητέρα δ᾽ αὐτοῦ\r\nπροσειπεῖν τὴν Σεμέλην διὰ τὴν πρόρρησιν, ἄλλως τε καὶ τοῦ θεοῦ τιμῶντος\r\nαὐτήν, [C] ἅτε πρώτην ἱερόφαντιν τῆς ἔτι μελλούσης ἐπιφοιτήσεως.\r\n\r\n(I think then that she was the first among the Greeks to perceive that\r\nthere was to be before long a visible manifestation of this god, and that\r\nshe foretold it, and then that, sooner than was fitting, she gave the\r\nsignal for certain of the mystic rites connected with his worship, because\r\nshe had not the patience to wait for the appointed time, and thus she was\r\nconsumed by the fire that fell upon her. But when it was the will of Zeus\r\nto bestow on all mankind in common a new order of things, and to make them\r\npass from the nomadic to a more civilised mode of life, Dionysus came from\r\nIndia and revealed himself as very god made visible, visiting the cities\r\nof men and leading with him a great host of beings in some sort divine;\r\nand everywhere he bestowed on all men in common as the symbol of his\r\nmanifestation the plant of “the gentle vine”; and since their lives were\r\nmade more gentle by it the Greeks as I think gave it that name;(201) and\r\nthey called Semele the mother of Dionysus because of the prediction that\r\nshe had made, but also because the god honoured her as having been the\r\nfirst prophetess of his advent while it was yet to be.)\r\n\r\nΟὔσης δέ, ὡς ἄν τις ἀκριβῶς σκοπῶν ἐξετάσειε, τῆς ἱστορίας τοιαύτης, οἱ\r\nτὸν Διόνυσον ὅστις ποτ᾽ ἐστὶ θεῶν ζητοῦντες τἀληθὲς ἔχον ὡς ἔφην εἰς μῦθον\r\nδιεσκεύασαν, αἰνιττόμενοι τήν τε οὐσίαν τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ τὴν ἐν τοῖς νοητοῖς\r\nπαρὰ τῷ πατρὶ κύησιν καὶ τὸν ἀγέννητον αὐτοῦ τόκον ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ(202) .....\r\nἐν τῷ παντί, καὶ τἆλλα ἐφεξῆς ὅσα τοῦ ζητεῖν ἦν ἄξια,(203) φράζειν δέ γ᾽\r\nοὐ ῥᾴδια ἐμοί, τυχὸν μὲν [D] καὶ διὰ τὸ ἀγνοεῖν ἔτι περὶ αὐτῶν τὸ ἀκριβές,\r\nτυχὸν δὲ καὶ οὐκ ἐθέλοντι τὸν κρύφιον ἅμα καὶ φανερὸν θεὸν ὥσπερ ἐν θεάτρῳ\r\nπροβάλλειν ἀκοαῖς ἀνεξετάστοις καὶ διανοίαις ἐπὶ πάντα μάλλον ἢ τὸ\r\nφιλοσοφεῖν τετραμμέναις.\r\n\r\n(Now since this is the historical truth of these events if they are\r\naccurately considered and examined, those who sought to discover what sort\r\nof god Dionysus is worked into a myth the truth which is as I said, and\r\nexpressed in an allegory both the essential nature of the god and his\r\nconception in his father Zeus among the intelligible gods, and further his\r\nbirth independently of generation in this our world.(204) ... in the whole\r\nuniverse, and in their proper order all those other facts which are well\r\nworth studying but too difficult for me at any rate to describe; partly\r\nperhaps because I am still ignorant of the precise truth about them,(205)\r\nbut perhaps also because I am unwilling to exhibit as in a theatre this\r\ngod who is at once hidden and manifest, and that, too, to ears that have\r\nnot sought after truth and to minds disposed to anything rather than the\r\nstudy of philosophy.)\r\n\r\nἈλλ᾽ ὑπὲρ μὲν τούτων ἴστω Διόνυσος αὐτός, ᾧ καὶ προσεύχομαι τάς τε ἐμὰς\r\nκαὶ τὰς ὑμετέρας ἐκβακχεῦσαι φρένας ἐπὶ τὴν ἀληθῆ τῶν θεῶν γνῶσιν, ὡς ἂν\r\nμὴ πολὺν ἀβάκχευτοι χρόνον τῷ θεῷ μένοντες [222] ὁπόσα ὁ Πενθεὺς(206)\r\nπάθωμεν, ἴσως μὲν καὶ ζῶντες, πάντως δὲ ἀπαλλαγέντες τοῦ σώματος. ὅτῳ γὰρ\r\nἂν(207) μὴ τὸ πεπληθυσμένον τῆς ζωῆς ὑπὸ τῆς ἑνοειδοῦς καὶ ἐν τῷ μεριστῷ\r\nπαντελῶς ἀδιαιρέτου ὅλης τε ἐν πᾶσιν ἀμιγοῦς προüπαρχούσης οὐσίας τοῦ\r\nΔιονύσου τελεσιουργηθῇ(208) διὰ τῆς περὶ τὸν θεὸν ἐνθέου βακχείας, τούτῳ\r\nκίνδυνος ἐπὶ πολλὰ ῥυῆναι τὴν ζωήν, ῥυεῖσαν δὲ διεσπάσθαι καὶ\r\nδιασπασθεῖσαν οἴχεσθαι· [B] τὸ δὲ ῥυεῖσαν καὶ διασπασθεῖσαν μὴ προσέχων\r\nτις τοῖς ῥήμασιν ὑδάτιον μηδὲ λίνου μήρινθον ἀκροάσθω, ξυνιέτω δὲ τὰ\r\nλεγόμενα τρόπον ἄλλον, ὃν Πλάτων, ὃν Πλωτίνος, ὃν Πορφύριος, ὃν ὁ\r\nδαιμόνιος Ἰάμβλιχος. ὃς δ᾽ ἂν μὴ ταύτῃ ποιῇ, γελάσεται μέν, ἴστω μέντοι\r\nΣαρδώνιον γελῶν ἔρημος ὢν ἀεὶ τῆς τῶν θεῶν γνώσεως, ἧς ἀντάξιον οὐδὲ τὸ\r\nπᾶσαν ὁμοῦ μετὰ τῆς τῶν Ῥωμαίων [C] ἐπιτροπεῦσαι τὴν βαρβάρων ἔγωγε θείμην\r\nἄν, οὐ μὰ τὸν ἐμὸν δεσπότην Ἥλιον. ἀλλά με πάλιν οὐκ οἶδ᾽ ὅστις θεῶν ἐπὶ\r\nταῦτ᾽ ἐβάκχευσεν οὐ προελόμενον.\r\n\r\n(However let Dionysus himself decide about these things, though I do\r\nindeed implore him to inspire my mind and yours with his own sacred frenzy\r\nfor the true knowledge of the gods, so that we may not by remaining too\r\nlong uninspired by him have to suffer the fate of Pentheus, perhaps even\r\nwhile we are alive, but most certainly after death has freed us from the\r\nbody. For he in whom the abundance of life has not been perfected by the\r\nessential nature of Dionysus, uniform and wholly indivisible as it is in\r\nthe divisible world and pre‐existing whole and unmixed in all things, he I\r\nsay who has not been perfected by means of the Bacchic and divine frenzy\r\nfor the god, runs the risk that his life may flow into too many channels,\r\nand as it flows be torn to shreds, and hence come to naught. But when I\r\nsay “flow” or “torn to shreds” no one must consider the bare meaning of\r\nthe words and suppose that I mean a mere trickle of water or a thread of\r\nlinen, but he must understand these words in another sense, that used by\r\nPlato, Plotinus, Porphyry and the inspired Iamblichus. One who does not\r\ninterpret them thus will laugh at them no doubt, but let me assure him\r\nthat it will be a Sardonic laugh,(209) since he will be forever deprived\r\nof that knowledge of the gods which I hold to be more precious than to\r\nrule over the whole world, Roman and barbarian put together, yea, I swear\r\nit by my lord Helios. But again some god or other and no choice of my own\r\nhas made me rave with this Bacchic frenzy.)\r\n\r\nοὗ δὲ ἕνεκεν ἔφην αὐτά· κατὰ μὲν τὴν διάνοιαν ἀπεμφαίνοντες ὅταν οἱ μῦθοι\r\nγίγνωνται περὶ τῶν θείων, αὐτόθεν ἡμῖν ὥσπερ βοῶσι καὶ διαμαρτύρονται μὴ\r\nπιστεύειν ἁπλῶς, ἀλλὰ τὸ λεληθὸς σκοπεῖν καὶ διερευνᾶσθαι. τοσούτῳ δ᾽ ἐστὶ\r\nκρεῖττον ἐν τούτοις τοῦ σεμνοῦ τὸ ἀπεμφαῖνον, ὅσῳ διὰ μὲν ἐκείνου καλοὺς\r\nλίαν καὶ μεγάλους καὶ ἀγαθούς, [D] ἀνθρώπους δὲ ὅμως τοὺς θεοὺς κίνδυνος\r\nνομίσαι, διὰ δὲ τῶν ἀπεμφαινόντων ὑπεριδόντας τῶν ἐν τῷ φανερῷ λεγομένων\r\nἐπὶ τὴν ἐξῃρημένην αὐτῶν οὐσίαν καὶ ὑπερέχουσαν πάντα τὰ ὄντα καθαρὰν\r\nνόησιν ἐλπὶς ἀναδραμεῖν.\r\n\r\n(To go back then to what led me to say all this. Whenever myths on sacred\r\nsubjects are incongruous in thought, by that very fact they cry aloud, as\r\nit were, and summon us not to believe them literally but to study and\r\ntrack down their hidden meaning. And in such myths the incongruous element\r\nis even more valuable than the serious and straightforward, the more so\r\nthat when the latter is used there is risk of our regarding the gods as\r\nexceedingly great and noble and good certainly, but still as human beings,\r\nwhereas when the meaning is expressed incongruous there is some hope that\r\nmen will neglect the more obvious sense of the words, and that pure\r\nintelligence may rise to the comprehension of the distinctive nature of\r\nthe gods that transcends all existing things.)\r\n\r\n[223] Αἴτιαι μὲν οὖν αὗται τοῦ τὴν τελεστικὴν καὶ μυσταγωγὸν φιλοσοφίαν τὰ\r\nμὲν ῥήματα παντὸς μᾶλλον εὐαγῆ καὶ σεμνὰ προφέρεσθαι, κατὰ δὲ τὴν διάνοιαν\r\nἀλλοιοτέραν ποιεῖσθαι τὴν ἐξήγησιν τῶν τοιούτων. ὁ δὲ τῆς τῶν ἠθῶν\r\nἐπανορθώσεως ἕνεκα τοὺς λόγους πλάττων καὶ μύθους παράγων δράτω(210) τοῦτο\r\nμὴ πρὸς ἄνδρας, ἀλλὰ πρὸς παῖδας ἤτοι καθ᾽ ἡλικίαν ἢ τῷ φρονεῖν, πάντως δὲ\r\nτῶν λόγων τούτων δεομένους. εἰ μὲν οὖν ἡμεῖς σοι παῖδες ἐφάνημεν εἴτε [B]\r\nἐγὼ εἴτε Ἀνατόλιος οὑτοσί, συγκαταρίθμει δὲ τούτῳ καὶ τὸν Μεμμόριον καὶ\r\nτὸν Σαλούστιον, πρὸς τούτοις δέ, εἰ βούλει, καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους ἑξῆς,\r\nἈντικύρας σοι δεῖ· τί γὰρ ἂν ἀκκίζοιτί τις; ἐπεὶ πρὸς τῶν θεῶν καὶ πρὸς\r\nαὐτοῦ τοῦ μύθου, μᾶλλον δὲ τοῦ κοινῇ πάντων βασιλέως Ἡλίου, τί σοι μέγα ἢ\r\nμικρὸν πεποίηται ἔργον; τίνι παρέστης ἀγωνιζομένῳ μετὰ τοὺ δικαίου; τίνα\r\nἐθεράπευσας πενθοῦντα, [C] τῷ λόγῳ διδάξας, ὅτι μὴ κακὸν ὁ θάνατος μήτε τῷ\r\nπαθόντι μήτε τοῖς οἰκείοις αὐτοῦ; τίς δ᾽ αἰτιάσεταί σε τῆς ἑαυτοῦ\r\nμειρακίσκος σωφροσύνης, ὅτι πεποίηκας αὐτὸν ἐξ ἀσώτου σώφρονα καὶ καλὸν οὐ\r\nτὸ σῶμα μόνον, ἀλλὰ πολὺ μᾶλλον τὴν ψυχὴν φαίνεσθαι; τίνα δὲ ἄσκησιν\r\nἐποιήσω τοῦ βίου; τί δέ σοι ἄξιον τῆς Διογένους βακτηρίας ἢ ναὶ μὰ Δία τῆς\r\nπαρρησίας πεποίηται; ἔργον οἴει μέγα βακτηρίαν λαβεῖν ἢ τρίχας ἀνεῖναι,\r\n[D] καὶ περινοστεῖν τὰς πόλεις καὶ τὰ στρατόπεδα, καὶ τοῖς μὲν βελτίστοις\r\nλοιδορεῖσθαι, τοὺς δὲ χειρίστους θεραπεύειν; εἰπὲ πρὸς τοῦ Διὸς καὶ πρὸς\r\nτουτωνὶ τῶν ἀκροωμένων, οἷ δι᾽ ὑμᾶς τὴν φιλοσοφίαν ἐκτρέπονται, ἀνθ᾽ ὅτου\r\nπρὸς μὲν τὸν μακαρίτην Κωνστάντιον εἰς Ἰταλίαν ἦλθες, οὐκέτι μέντοι καὶ\r\nμέχρι τῶν Γαλλιῶν; καίτοι πορευθεὶς πρὸς ἡμᾶς, εἰ μηδὲν ἄλλο, ξυνεῖναι\r\nγοῦν σου τῆς φωνῆς μᾶλλον δυναμένῳ πλησιάζειν ἔμελλες ἀνθρώπῳ.

But one who is inventing tales for the purpose of reforming\r\nmorals and inserts myths therein, does so not for men but for those who\r\nare children whether in years or intelligence, and who on all accounts\r\nstand in need of such tales. If, however, you took us for children, me,\r\nfor instance, or Anatolius here, and you may reckon with us Memmorius also\r\nand Sallust and add if you please all the others in due order, then you\r\nneed a voyage to Anticyra.(214) For why should one pretend to be polite?\r\nTell me, I ask, in the name of the gods, and of myth itself, or rather in\r\nthe name of Helios the King of all the universe, what have you ever\r\naccomplished, great or small? When did you ever champion one who was\r\nresisting oppression and had right on his side? When did you ever comfort\r\nthe mourner and teach him by your arguments that death is not an evil\r\neither for him who has suffered it or for his friends? What youth will\r\never give you the credit for his temperance, and say that you have made\r\nhim show himself sober instead of dissolute, and beautiful not merely in\r\nbody but far more in soul? What strenuous discipline have you ever\r\nembraced? What have you ever done to make you worthy of the staff of\r\nDiogenes or still more, by Zeus, of his freedom of speech? Do you really\r\nthink it so great an achievement to carry a staff and let your hair grow,\r\nand haunt cities and camps uttering calumnies against the noblest men, and\r\nflattering the vilest? Tell me in the name of Zeus and of this audience\r\nnow present, who are disgusted with philosophy because of men of your\r\nsort, why was it that you visited the late Emperor Constantius in Italy\r\nbut could not travel as far as Gaul? And yet if you had come to me you\r\nwould at any rate have associated with one who was better able to\r\ncomprehend your language. What do you gain by travelling about in all\r\ndirections and wearing out the very mules you ride? Yes, and I hear that\r\nyou wear out the mule drivers as well, and that they dread the sight of\r\nyou Cynics even more than of soldiers. For I am told that some of you\r\nbelabour them more cruelly with your staffs than do the soldiers with\r\ntheir swords, so that they are naturally more afraid of you. Long ago I\r\ngave you a nickname and now I think I will write it down. It is\r\n“monks,”(215) a name applied to certain persons by the impious Galilaeans.\r\nThey are for the most part men who by making small sacrifices gain much or\r\nrather everything from all sources, and in addition secure honour, crowds\r\nof attendants and flattery. Something like that is your method, except\r\nperhaps for uttering divine revelations: but this is not your custom,\r\nthough it is ours; for we are wiser than those insensate men. And perhaps\r\ntoo there is this difference that you have no excuse for levying tribute\r\non specious pretexts as they do; which they call “alms,” whatever that may\r\nmean. But in all other respects your habits and theirs are very much\r\nalike. Like them you have abandoned your country, you wander about all\r\nover the world, and you gave more trouble than they did at my\r\nheadquarters, and were more insolent. For they were at any rate invited to\r\ncome, but you we tried to drive away. And what good have you, or rather,\r\nwhat have the rest of us derived from all this? First arrived Asclepiades,\r\nthen Serenianus, then Chytron, then a tall boy with yellow hair—I don’t\r\nknow his name—then you, and with you all twice as many more. And now, my\r\ngood sirs, what good has come from your journey? What city or individual\r\nhas had any experience of your alleged freedom of speech? Was it not\r\nfoolish of you to choose in the first place to make this journey to an\r\nEmperor who did not even wish to set eyes on you? And when you had\r\narrived, did you not behave even more foolishly and ignorantly and\r\ninsanely in flattering and barking at me in the same breath, and offering\r\nme your books, and moreover imploring that they should be taken to me? I\r\ndo not believe that any one of you ever visited a philosopher’s school as\r\ndiligently as you did my secretary: in fact the entrance to the Palace\r\nstood for you in place of the Academy and the Lyceum and the Portico.)\r\n\r\nΟὐκ ἀπάξετε ταῦτα; οὐ καταβαλεῖτε νῦν γοῦν, εἰ καὶ μὴ πρότερον, ὅτε ὑμῖν\r\nοὐδέν ἐστι πλέον ἀπὸ τῆς κόμης καὶ τῆς βακτηρίας; πῶς δὲ καὶ γέγονεν ὑφ᾽\r\nὑμῶν εὐκαταφρόνητος ἡ φιλοσοφία; τῶν ῥητορικῶν [B] οἱ δυσμαθέστατοι καὶ\r\nοὐδ᾽ ὑπ᾽ αὐτοῦ τοῦ βασιλέως Ἑρμοῦ τὴν γλῶτταν ἐκκαθαρθῆναι δυνάμενοι,\r\nφρενωθῆναι δὲ οὐδὲ πρὸς αὐτῆς τῆς Ἀθηνᾶς σὺν τῷ Ἑρμῇ, τοῦτο ἐκ τῆς\r\nἀγοραίου καὶ περιτρεχούσης ἁρπάσαντες ἐντρεχείας· οὐδὲ γὰρ ἐν παροιμίᾳ\r\nπεριφερόμενον αὐτὸ γιγνώσκουσι τὸ ὅτι βότρυς πρὸς βότρυν πεπαίνεται·\r\nὁρμῶσιν ἐπὶ τὸν Κυνισμόν· βακτηρία, τρίβων, [C] κόμη, τὸ ἐντεῦθεν ἀμαθία,\r\nθράσος, ἰταμότης καὶ πάντα ἁπλῶς τὰ τοιαῦτα. τὴν σύντομον, φασίν, ὁδὸν καὶ\r\nσύντονον ἐπὶ τὴν ἀρετὴν ἰέναι(216) ὄφελον καὶ ὑμεῖς τὴν μακρὰν ἐπορεύεσθε·\r\nῥᾷον ἂν δι᾽ ἐκείνης ἢ διὰ ταύτης ἤλθετε. οὐκ ἴστε, ὅτι μεγάλας ἔχουσιν αἱ\r\nσύντομοι τὰς χαλεπότητας; καὶ ὥσπερ ἐν ταῖς λεωφόροις ὁ μὲν τὴν σύντομον\r\nἐλθεῖν δυνηθεὶς ῥᾷον ἐκπερίεισι τὴν κύκλῳ, οὐκέτι μέντοι τὸ ἀνάπαλιν ὁ\r\nκύκλῳ πορευθεὶς ἔλθοι ἂν πάντως [D] καὶ τὴν ἐπίτομον, οὕτω δὴ(217) καὶ ἐν\r\nτῇ φιλοσοφίᾳ τέλος τέ ἑστι καὶ ἀρχὴ μία γνῶναί τε ἑαυτὸν καὶ ἀφομοιωθῆναι\r\nτοῖς θεοῖς· ἀρχὴ μὲν οὖν ἑαυτὸν γνῶναι, τέλος δὲ ἡ πρὸς τοὺς κρείττονας\r\nὁμοιότης.\r\n\r\n(Have done with all this nonsense! At any rate lay it aside now if not\r\nbefore, when you can get no advantage from your long hair and your staff.\r\nShall I tell you how you have caused philosophy to be lightly esteemed? It\r\nis because the most ignorant of the rhetoricians, those whose tongues not\r\nKing Hermes himself could purify, and who could not be made wise by Athene\r\nherself with the aid of Hermes, having picked up their knowledge from\r\ntheir industry in frequenting public places,—for they do not know the\r\ntruth of the current proverb, “Grape ripens near grape”(218)—then all rush\r\ninto Cynicism. They adopt the staff, the cloak, the long hair, the\r\nignorance that goes with these, the impudence, the insolence, and in a\r\nword everything of the sort. They say that they are travelling the short\r\nand ready road to virtue.(219) I would that you were going by the longer!\r\nFor you would more easily arrive by that road than by this of yours. Are\r\nyou not aware that short cuts usually involve one in great difficulties?\r\nFor just as is the case with the public roads, a traveller who is able to\r\ntake a short cut will more easily than other men go all the way round,\r\nwhereas it does not at all follow that he who went round could always go\r\nthe short cut, so too in philosophy the end and the beginning are one,\r\nnamely, to know oneself and to become like the gods. That is to say, the\r\nfirst principle is self‐knowledge, and the end of conduct is the\r\nresemblance to the higher powers.)\r\n\r\nὍστις οὖν Κυνικὸς εἶναι ἐθέλει, πάντων ὑπεριδὼν τῶν νομισμάτων καὶ τῶν\r\nἀνθρωπίνων δοξῶν, εἰς ἑαυτὸν καὶ τὸν θεὸν ἐπέστραπται πρότερον. ἐκείνῳ τὸ\r\nχρυσίον οὐκ ἔστι χρυσίον, οὐχ ἡ ψάμμος ψάμμος, εἰ πρὸς ἀμοιβήν τις αὐτὰ\r\nἀξετάζοι καὶ τῆς ἀξίας αὐτῶν ἐπιτρέψειεν αὐτῷ τιμητῇ γενέσθαι· [226] γῆν\r\nγὰρ αὐτὰ οἶδεν ἀμφότερα. τὸ σπανιώτερον δὲ καὶ τὸ ῥᾷον ἀνθρώπων εἶναι\r\nκενοδοξίας ταῦτα καὶ ἀμαθίας νενόμικεν ἔργα· τὸ αἰσχρὸν ἢ καλὸν οὐκ ἐν\r\nτοῖς ἐπαινουμένοις ἢ ψεγομένοις τίθεται, ἀλλ᾽ ἐν τῇ φύσει· φεύγει τὰς\r\nπεριττ`ας τροφάς· ἀποστρέφεται δὲ τὰ ἀφροδίσια. βιαζομένου δὲ τοῦ σώματος,\r\nοὐ δόξῃ προστέτηκεν οὐδὲ περιμένει τὸν μάγειρον καὶ τὰ ὑποτρίμματα καὶ τὴν\r\nκνίσσαν, οὐδὲ τὴν Φρύνην οὐδὲ τὴν Λαΐδα οὐδὲ τὴν τοῦ δεῖνος(220)\r\nπεριβλέπεται γαμετὴν οὐδὲ [B] τὸ θυγάτριον οὐδὲ τὴν θεράπαιναν· ἀλλ᾽ ὡς\r\nἔνι μάλιστα ἐκ τῶν προστυχόντων ἀποπλήσας τὴν θεραπείαν τοῦ σώματος καὶ τὸ\r\nἐνοχλοῦν ἐξ αὐτοῦ παρωσάμενος, ἄνωθεν ἐκ τῆς Ὀλύμπου κορυφῆς ἐπιβλέπει\r\nτοὺς ἄλλους\r\n\r\n(Therefore he who desires to be a Cynic despises all the usages and\r\nopinions of men, and turns his mind first of all to himself and the god.\r\nFor him gold is not gold or sand sand, if one enquire into their value\r\nwith a view to exchanging them, and leave it to him to rate them at their\r\nproper worth: for he knows that both of them are but earth. And the fact\r\nthat one is scarcer and the other easier to obtain he thinks is merely the\r\nresult of the vanity and ignorance of mankind. He will judge of the\r\nbaseness or nobility of an action, not by the applause or blame of men but\r\nby its intrinsic nature. He avoids any excess in food, and renounces the\r\npleasures of love. When he is forced to obey the needs of the body he is\r\nnot the slave of opinion, nor does he wait for a cook and sauces and a\r\nsavoury smell, nor does he ever look about for Phryne or Lais or So‐and‐\r\nso’s wife or young daughter or serving‐maid. But as far as possible he\r\nsatisfies his body’s needs with whatever comes to hand, and by thrusting\r\naside all hindrances derived from the body he contemplates from above,\r\nfrom the peaks of Olympus, other men who are)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ἄτης ἐν λειμῶνι κατὰ σκότον ἠλάσκοντας,\r\n\r\n    (“Wandering in darkness in the meadow of Ate,”(221))\r\n\r\n\r\nὑπὲρ ὀλίγων παντάπασιν ἀπολαύσεων ὑπομένοντας ὅσα οὐδὲ παρὰ τὸν Κωκυτὸν\r\nκαὶ τὸν Ἀχέροντα θρυλοῦσιν οἱ κομψότεροι τῶν ποιητῶν. ἡ σύντομος ὁδός\r\nἐστιν αὕτη.

Now the true short cut\r\nto philosophy is this. A man must completely come out of himself and\r\nrecognise that he is divine, and not only keep his mind untiringly and\r\nsteadfastly fixed on divine and stainless and pure thoughts, but he must\r\nalso utterly despise his body, and think it, in the words of Heracleitus,\r\n“more worthless than dirt.”(222) And by the easiest means he must satisfy\r\nhis body’s needs so long as the god commands him to use it as an\r\ninstrument.)\r\n\r\nΤαῦτα μὲν οὖν ὡς φασὶ ταύτῃ.(223) ἐπανάξω δὲ ὅθεν ἐξέβην. ἐπειδὴ γὰρ τοὺς\r\nμύθους προσήκει πρὸς παῖδας ἤτοι τῷ φρονεῖν, [D] κἂν ἄνδρες ὦσιν, ἢ καὶ\r\nτοῖς καθ᾽ ἡλικίαν παιδαρίοις ἀπαγγέλλειν, ἐξεταστέον ὅπως μήτε εἰς θεοὺς\r\nμήτε εἰς ἀνθρώπους πλημμελὲς ᾿ἤ, καθάπερ ἔναγχος, δυσσεβές τι ῥηθείη· καὶ\r\nπροσέτι τοῦτο ἐν ἅπασιν ἀκριβῶς βασανιστέον, εἰ πιθανός, εἰ τοῖς πράγμασι\r\nπροσφυής, εἰ μῦθός ἐστιν ἀληθῶς ὁ πλαττόμενος. ἐπεὶ τό γε νῦν ὑπὸ σοῦ\r\nπεποιημένον οὐ μῦθός ἐστι σός·(224) καίτοι τοῦτό γε ἐνεανιεύσω· ἀλλ᾽ ὁ μὲν\r\nμῦθος ἐστι παλαιός, [227] ἐφήρμοσας δὲ αὐτὸν σὺ πράγμασιν ἑτέροις, ὅπερ\r\nοἶμαι ποιεῖν εἰώθασιν οἱ τῇ τροπικῇ χρώμενοι τὼν νοημάτων κατασκευῇ· πολὺς\r\nδὲ ἐν τούτοις ὁ Πάριός ἐστι ποιητής. ἔοικας οὖν οὐδὲ πεποιηκὼς μῦθον, ὦ\r\nξυνετώτατε, μάτην νεανιεύεσθαι· καίτοι τοῦτο τίτθης ἔργον ἐστὶν\r\nεὐτραπέλου.

And moreover we must in all cases\r\napply careful tests to see whether the myth is plausible, closely related\r\nto the matter discussed and whether what is invented is really a myth. Now\r\nwhat you composed lately is not your own myth though you boasted that it\r\nwas. Nay, your myth was an old one and you did but adapt it to fresh\r\ncircumstances, as I believe people are in the habit of doing who use\r\ntropes and figures of thought. The poet of Paros(227) for instance is much\r\ngiven to this style. It seems then that you did not even invent your myth,\r\nmy very clever friend, and that yours was an idle boast. Though in fact\r\nthe thing is done by any nurse with an inventive turn. And if the mythical\r\ntales of Plutarch had ever fallen into your hands you would have failed to\r\nobserve what a difference there is between inventing a myth from the\r\nbeginning and adapting to one’s own purpose a myth that already exists.\r\nBut I must not detain you even for a moment or hinder you on your way\r\nalong that short cut to wisdom by making you embark on books that are long\r\nand hard to read. You have not even heard of the myth by Demosthenes which\r\nhe of the Paeanian deme addressed to the Athenians when the Macedonian\r\ndemanded that the Athenian orators be given up. You ought to have invented\r\nsomething of that sort. In Heaven’s name was it too hard for you to relate\r\nsome little myth of the kind? You will force me too to become a myth‐\r\nmaker.)\r\n\r\n[C] Πλουσίῳ ἀνδρὶ πρόβατα ἦν πολλὰ καὶ ἀγέλαι βοῶν καὶ αἰπόλια πλατέ\r\nαἰγῶν, ἵπποι δὲ αὐτῷ πολλάκις μυρίαι ἕλος κάτα βουκολέοντο, καὶ ποιμένες\r\nδοῦλοί τε καὶ ἐλεύθεροι μισθωτοί, καὶ βουκόλοι βοῶν καὶ αἰγῶν αἰπόλοι καὶ\r\nἱπποφορβοὶ τῶν ἵππων, καὶ πλεῖστα κτήματα. τούτων δὲ αὐτῷ πολλὰ μὲν ὁ\r\nπατὴρ ἀπελελοίπει, πολλαπλάσια δὲ αὐτὸς ἐπεκτήσατο,(228) πλουτεῖν θέλων ἐν\r\nδίκῃ τε καὶ παρὰ δίκην· ἔμελε γὰρ αὐτῷ τῶν(229) θεῶν ὀλίγον.

Now much of all this his father had bequeathed to\r\nhim, but he had himself acquired many times more, being eager to enrich\r\nhimself whether justly or unjustly; for little did he care for gods.\r\nSeveral wives he had, and sons and daughters by them, among whom he\r\ndivided his wealth before he died. But he did not teach them how to manage\r\nit, or how to acquire more if it should fail, or how to preserve what they\r\nhad. For in his ignorance he thought that their mere numbers would\r\nsuffice, nor had he himself any real knowledge of that sort of art, since\r\nhe had not acquired his wealth on any rational principle but rather by use\r\nand wont, like quack doctors who try to cure their patients by relying on\r\ntheir experience only, so that many diseases escape them altogether.(233)\r\nAccordingly since he thought that a number of sons would suffice to\r\npreserve his wealth, he took no thought how to make them virtuous. But\r\nthis very thing proved to be the beginning of their iniquitous behaviour\r\nto one another. For every one of them desired to be as wealthy as his\r\nfather and to possess the whole for himself alone, and so attacked the\r\nbrother that was his neighbour. Now for a time they continued to behave\r\nthus. And their relatives also shared in the folly and ignorance of those\r\nsons, since they themselves had had no better education. Then ensued a\r\ngeneral slaughter, and heaven brought the tragic curse(234) to fulfilment.\r\nFor “by the edge of the sword they divided their patrimony” and everything\r\nwas thrown into confusion. The sons demolished the ancestral temples which\r\ntheir father before them had despised and had stripped of the votive\r\nofferings that had been dedicated by many worshippers, but not least by\r\nhis own ancestors. And besides demolishing the temples they erected\r\nsepulchres(235) both on new sites and on the old sites of the temples, as\r\nthough impelled by fate or by an unconscious presentiment that they would\r\nere long need many such sepulchres, seeing that they so neglected the\r\ngods.)\r\n\r\nΠάντων οὖν ὁμοῦ φυρομένων καὶ ξυντελουμένων γάμων τε οὐ γάμων καὶ\r\nβεβηλουμένων ὁμοῦ τοῖς θείοις τῶν ἀνθρωπίνων, [D] τὸν Δία ἔλεος ὑπῆλθεν·\r\nεἶτα ἀπιδὼν πρὸς τὸν Ἥλιον· ὦ παῖ, εἶπεν, οὐρανοῦ καὶ γῆς ἀρχαιότερον ἐν\r\nθεοῖς βλάστημα, μνησικακεῖν ἔτι διανοῇ τῆς ὑπεροψίας ἀνδρὶ αὐθάδει καὶ\r\nτολμηρῷ, ὅς σε ἀπολιπὼν αὑτῷ τε καὶ γένει αἴτιος(236) ἐγένετο τῶν\r\nτηλικούτων παθημάτων; ἢ νομίζεις, [229] ὅτι μὴ χαλεπαίνεις αὐτῷ μηδ᾽\r\nἀγανακτεῖς μηδ᾽ ἐπὶ τὸ γένος αὐτοῦ τοὺς οἰστοὺς θήγεις, ἔλαττον εἶναι\r\nταύτης αἴτιος αὐτῷ τῆς ξυμφορᾶς, ἔρημον αὐτοῦ τὴν οἰκίαν ἀφείς; ἀλλ᾽, ἔφη,\r\nκαλῶμεν τὰς Μοίρας, εἴ πῃ βοηθητέος ὁ ἀνήρ ἐστιν. αἱ δὲ ὑπήκουσαν αὐτίκα\r\nτῷ Διί. καὶ ὁ μὲν Ἥλιος, ὥσπερ ἐννοῶν τι καὶ λογιζόμενος αὐτὸς ἐν ἑαυτῷ,\r\nπροσεῖχεν εἰς τὸν Δία πήξας τὰ ὄμματα. τῶν Μοιρῶν δὲ ἡ πρεσβυτάτη·\r\nΚωλύετον, ἔφη, ὦ πάτερ, ἡ Ὁσιότης ξὺν τῇ Δίκῃ. σὸν οὖν ἔργον ἐστίν, [B]\r\nἐπείπερ ἡμᾶς ἐκέλευσας ὑπεικαθεῖν αὐταῖς, πεῖσαι καὶ ἐκείνας. ἀλλ᾽ ἐμαὶ\r\nγάρ εἰσιν, ἔφη, θυγατέρες, καὶ ἄξιον δὴ ἐρέσθαι αὐτάς· τί τοίνυν, ὦ\r\nποτνία, φατόν; ἀλλὰ τούτου μέν, εἰπέτην, ὦ πάτερ, αὐτὸς εἶ κύριος. σκόπει\r\nδὲ ὅπως ἐν ἀνθρώποις ὁ πονηρὸς οὑτοσὶ τῆς ἀνοσιουργίας ζῆλος μὴ παντάπασιν\r\nἐπικρατήσει.(237) πρὸς ἀμφότερα, εἶπεν, ἐγὼ σκέψομαι. καὶ αἱ Μοῖραι\r\nπλησίον παροῦσαι πάντα ἐπέκλωθον, [C] ὡς ὁ πατὴρ ἐβούλετο.\r\n\r\n(Now when all was in confusion, and many marriages that were no\r\nmarriages(238) were being concluded, and the laws of god and man alike had\r\nbeen profaned, Zeus was moved with compassion and addressing himself to\r\nHelios he said: “O my son, divine offspring more ancient than heaven and\r\nearth, art thou still minded to resent the insolence of that arrogant and\r\naudacious mortal, who by forsaking thee brought so many calamities on\r\nhimself and his race? Thinkest thou that, though thou dost not show thine\r\nanger and resentment against him nor whet thine arrows against his\r\nchildren, thou art any less the author of his destruction in that thou\r\ndost abandon his house to desolation? Nay,” said Zeus, “let us summon the\r\nFates and enquire whether any assistance may be given the man.” Forthwith\r\nthe Fates obeyed the call of Zeus. But Helios who was as though absorbed\r\nin thought and inward debate yet gave constant heed and fixed his eyes on\r\nZeus. Then spoke the eldest of the Fates: “O our father, Piety and Justice\r\nboth restrain us. Therefore it is thine to prevail on them also, since\r\nthou hast ordered us to be subservient to them.” And Zeus made answer,\r\n“Truly they are my daughters, and it is meet that I question them. What\r\nthen have ye to say, ye venerable goddesses?” “Nay, father,” they replied,\r\n“that is as thou thyself dost ordain. But be careful lest this wicked zeal\r\nfor impious deeds prevail universally among men.” “I will myself look to\r\nboth these matters,” Zeus replied. Then the Fates approached and spun all\r\nas their father willed.)\r\n\r\nΛέγειν δὲ ὁ Ζεὺς ἄρχεται πρὸς τὸν Ἥλιον· τουτὶ τὸ παιδίον, ἔφη· ξυγγενὲς\r\nδὲ ἦν αὐτῶν ἄρα παρερριμμένον που καὶ ἀμελούμενον, ἀδελφιδοῦς ἐκείνου τοῦ\r\nπλουσίου καὶ ἀνεψιὸς τῶν κληρονόμων· τοῦτο, ἔφη, σόν ἐστιν ἔκγονον. ὄμοσον\r\nοὖν τὸ ἐμόν τε καὶ τὸ σὸν(239) σκῆπτρον, ἦ μὴν ἐπιμελήσεσθαι διαφερόντως\r\nαὐτοῦ καὶ ποιμανεῖν αὐτὸ καὶ θεραπεύσειν τῆς νόσου.

Swear then by my sceptre and thine that thou wilt care\r\nespecially for him and cure him of this malady. For thou seest how he is\r\nas it were infected with smoke and filth and darkness and there is danger\r\nthat the spark of fire which thou didst implant in him will be quenched,\r\nunless thou clothe thyself with might.(241) Take care of him therefore and\r\nrear him. For I and the Fates yield thee this task.” When King Helios\r\nheard this he was glad and took pleasure in the babe, since he perceived\r\nthat in him a small spark of himself was still preserved. And from that\r\ntime he reared the child whom he had withdrawn)\r\n\r\n\r\n          ἔκ θ᾽ αἵματος ἔκ τε κυδοιμοῦ\r\n    [230] Ἔκ τ᾽ ἀνδροκτασίης.\r\n\r\n    (“from the blood and noise of war and the slaughter of men.”(242)\r\n    )\r\n\r\n\r\nὁ πατὴρ δὲ ὁ Ζεὺς ἐκέλευσε καὶ τὴν Ἀθηνᾶν τὴν ἀμήτορα, τὴν παρθένον ἅμα τῷ\r\nἩλίῳ τὸ παιδάριον ἐκτρέφειν. ἐπεὶ δὲ ἐτράφη καὶ νεανίας ἐγένετο\r\n\r\n(And father Zeus bade Athene also, the Motherless Maiden, share with\r\nHelios the task of bringing up the child.

Then Helios of his grace, aided\r\nAthene, Goddess of Forethought, threw him into a slumber or trance, and so\r\ndiverted him from that purpose. Then when he had waked from this he went\r\naway into the desert. And there he found a stone and rested for a while\r\nthereon, debating within himself how he should escape evils so many and so\r\nvast. For all things now appeared grievous to him and for the moment there\r\nwas no hope anywhere. Then Hermes, who had an affinity for him,(246)\r\nappeared to him in the guise of a youth of his own age, and greeting him\r\nkindly said, “Follow me, and I will guide thee by an easier and smoother\r\nroad as soon as thou hast surmounted this winding and rugged place where\r\nthou seest all men stumbling and obliged to go back again.” Then the youth\r\nset out with great circumspection, carrying a sword and shield and spear,\r\nthough as yet his head was bare. Thus relying on Hermes he went forward by\r\na road smooth, untrodden and very bright, and overhung with fruits and\r\nmany lovely flowers such as the gods love, and with trees also, ivy and\r\nlaurel and myrtle. Now when Hermes had brought him to the foot of a great\r\nand lofty mountain, he said, “On the summit of this mountain dwells the\r\nfather of all the gods. Be careful then—for herein lies the greatest risk\r\nof all(247)—to worship him with the utmost piety and ask of him whatever\r\nthou wilt. Thou wilt choose, my child, only what is best.” So saying\r\nHermes once more became invisible, though the youth was fain to learn from\r\nhim what he ought to ask from the father of the gods. But when he saw that\r\nhe was no longer at his side he said, “The advice though incomplete is\r\ngood nevertheless. Therefore let me by the grace of fortune ask for what\r\nis best, though I do not as yet see clearly the father of the gods.

Then Zeus showed him Helios himself. Awestruck by that vision the\r\nyouth exclaimed, “For this and for all thy other favours I will dedicate\r\nmyself to thee, O Father of the Gods!” Then he cast his arms about the\r\nknees of Helios and would not let go his hold but kept entreating him to\r\nsave him. But Helios called Athene and bade her first enquire of him what\r\narms he had brought with him. And when she saw his shield and sword and\r\nspear, she said, “But where, my child, is thy aegis(251) and thy helmet?”\r\n“Even these that I have,” he replied, “I procured with difficulty. For in\r\nthe house of my kinsfolk there was none to aid one so despised.” “Learn\r\ntherefore,” said mighty Helios, “that thou must without fail return\r\nthither.” Thereupon he entreated him not to send him to earth again but to\r\ndetain him there, since he would never be able to mount upwards a second\r\ntime but would be overwhelmed by the ills of earth. But as he wept and\r\nimplored Helios replied, “Nay, thou art young and not yet initiated.\r\nReturn therefore to thine own people that thou mayst be initiated and\r\nthereafter dwell on earth in safety. For return thou must, and and cleanse\r\naway all impiety and invoke me to aid thee, and Athene and the other\r\ngods.” When Helios had said this the youth remained silent. Then mighty\r\nHelios led him to a high peak whose upper region was filled with light but\r\nthe lower with the thickest mist imaginable, through which, as through\r\nwater, the light of the rays of King Helios penetrated but faintly. “Thou\r\nseest,” said Helios, “thy cousin the heir?”(252) “I see him,” the youth\r\nreplied. “Again, dost thou see yonder herdsmen and shepherds?” The youth\r\nanswered that he did. “Then what thinkest thou of the heir’s disposition?\r\nAnd what of his shepherds and herdsmen?” “He seems to me,” replied the\r\nyouth, “to be for the most part asleep, sunk in forgetfulness and devoted\r\nto pleasure; and of his shepherds a few are honest, but most are vicious\r\nand brutal. For they devour or sell his sheep, and doubly injure their\r\nmaster, in that they not only ruin his flocks but besides that they make\r\ngreat gain and return him but little thereof, while they declare with loud\r\ncomplaint that they are defrauded of their wages. And yet it were better\r\nthat they should demand and obtain their full pay than that they should\r\ndestroy the flock.” “Now what if I and Athene here,” said Helios, “obeying\r\nthe command of Zeus, should appoint thee to govern all these, in place of\r\nthe heir?” Then the youth clung to him again and earnestly entreated that\r\nhe might remain there. “Do not be obstinate in disobedience,” said\r\nHelios,)\r\n\r\n\r\n    σ᾽ ἀπεχθήρω, ὡς νῦν ἔκπαγλ᾽ ἐφίλησα.\r\n\r\n    (“lest perchance I hate thee beyond measure, even as I have loved\r\n    thee.”(253))\r\n\r\n\r\nκαὶ ὁ νεανίσκος, Ἀλλ᾽, ὦ μέγιστε, εἶπεν, Ἥλιε καὶ Ἀθηνᾶ, σέ τε καὶ αὐτὸν\r\nἐπιμαρτύρομαι τὸν Δία, χρῆσθέ μοι πρὸς ὅ, τι βούλεσθε.

For now he thought that he had found a guide for the\r\njourney back, and for his sojourn on earth. Then said Athene, “Attend,\r\ngood youth, that art born of myself and of this god, thy noble sire! The\r\nmost virtuous of the shepherds do not please this heir, for flatterers and\r\nprofligates have made him their slave and tool. Thus it is that he is not\r\nbeloved by the good, and is most deeply wronged by those who are supposed\r\nto love him. Be careful then when thou returnest that he make thee not his\r\nflatterer rather than his friend. This second warning also do thou heed,\r\nmy son. Yonder man slumbers, and hence he is often deceived, but do thou\r\nbe sober and vigilant,(256) lest the flatterer assume the frankness of a\r\nfriend and so deceive thee; which is as though a smith covered with smoke\r\nand cinders should come wearing a white garment and with his face painted\r\nwhite, and thus induce thee to give him one of thy daughters in\r\nmarriage.(257) My third warning to thee is this: do thou very zealously\r\nkeep watch over thyself, and reverence us in the first place, and among\r\nmen only him who resembles us, and no one besides. Thou seest how false\r\nshame and excessive timidity have injured this foolish man.”)\r\n\r\nΚαὶ ὁ μέγας Ἥλιος αὖθις τὸν λόγον διαδεξάμενος εἶπεν.

Thou\r\nseest that it was treachery to his friends that destroyed this heir. Love\r\nthy subjects even as we love thee. Prefer our worship to all other\r\nblessings. For we are thy benefactors and friends and preservers.” At\r\nthese words the youth became calm and showed plainly that he was already\r\nobedient in all things to the gods. “Come,” said Helios, “now depart with\r\ngood hope. For everywhere we shall be with thee, even I and Athene and\r\nHermes here, and with us all the gods that are on Olympus or in the air or\r\non earth and the whole race of gods everywhere, so long as thou art pious\r\ntowards us and loyal to thy friends, and humane towards thy subjects,\r\nruling them and guiding them to what is best. But never yield to thy own\r\npassions or become the slave of theirs. Keep the armour that thou hast\r\nbrought hither, and depart, but first receive from me this torch so that\r\neven on earth a great light may shine for thee and that thou mayst not\r\nlong for the things of earth. And from fair Athene here receive an aegis\r\nand helmet. For as thou seest she has many, and she gives them to whom she\r\nwill. And Hermes too will give thee a golden wand. Go then thus adorned in\r\nfull armour over sea and land, steadfastly obeying our laws, and let no\r\nman or woman or kinsman or foreigner persuade thee to neglect our\r\ncommands. For while thou dost abide by them thou wilt be loved and\r\nhonoured by us and respected by our good servants and formidable to the\r\nwicked and impious. Know that a mortal frame was given to thee that thou\r\nmightest discharge these duties. For we desire, out of respect for thy\r\nancestor to cleanse the house of thy forefathers. Remember therefore that\r\nthou hast an immortal soul that is our offspring, and that if thou dost\r\nfollow us thou shalt be a god and with us shalt behold our father.”)\r\n\r\nΤοῦτο εἴτε μῦθος εἴτε ἀληθής ἐστι λόγος οὐκ οἶδα. τὸ παρὰ σοῦ δὲ\r\nπεποιημένον, τίνα βούλει τὸν Πᾶνα, [D] τίνα δὲ εἶναι τὸν Δία, εἰ μὴ\r\nτοῦτο,(261) ὡς ἐσμὲν ἐγώ τε καὶ σύ, σὺ μὲν ὁ Ζεύς, ἐγὼ δὲ ὁ Πάν; ὢ τοῦ\r\nγελοίου Ψευδόπανος, γελοιοτέρου μέντοι νὴ τὸν Ἀσκληπιὸν τοῦ πάντα μᾶλλον ἢ\r\nΔιὸς ἀνθρώπου. ταῦτα οὐκ ἔστιν ἀτεχνῶς ἐκ μαινομένου(262) στόματος οὔτι\r\nτὴν ἔνθεον, ἀλλὰ τὴν ἔκπληκτον μανίαν; οὐκ οἶσθα, ὅτι καὶ ὁ Σαλμωνεὺς\r\nἔδωκεν [235] ὑπὲρ τούτων τοῖς θεοῖς δίκην, ὅτι ἄνθρωπος ὢν ἐπεχείρει Ζεὺς\r\nεἶναι; τὸ δὲ ἐκ τῶν Ἡσιόδου λεγόμενον ὑπὲρ τῶν ὀνομασάντων ἑαυτοὺς τοῖς\r\nτῶν θεῶν ὀνόμασιν, Ἥρας τε καὶ Διός, εἰ μήπω καὶ νῦν ἀκήκοας, ἔχω σοι\r\nσυγγνῶναι· οὐδὲ γὰρ ἐπαιδοτριβήθης καλῶς οὐδὲ ἔτυχες καθηγεμόνος, ὁποίου\r\nπερὶ τοὺς ποιητὰς ἐγὼ τουτουὶ τοῦ φιλοσόφου, μεθ᾽ ὃν ἐπὶ τὰ πρόθυρα τῆς\r\nφιλοσοφίας ἦλθον ὑπ᾽ ἀνδρὶ τελεσθησόμενος, ὃν νενόμικα τῶν [B] κατ᾽\r\nἐμαυτὸν πάντων διαφέρειν. ὁ δέ με πρὸ πάντων ἀρετὴν ἀσκεῖν καὶ θεοὺς\r\nἁπάντων τῶν καλῶν νομίζειν ἡγεμόνας ἐδίδασκεν. εἰ μὲν οὖν τι προὔργου\r\nπεποίηκεν, αὐτὸς ἂν εἰδείη καὶ πρὸ τούτου γε οἱ βασιλεῖς θεοί· τουτὶ δὲ\r\nἐξῄρει τὸ μανιῶδες καὶ θρασύ, καὶ ἐπειρᾶτό με ποιεῖν ἐμαυτοῦ\r\nσωφρονέστερον. ἐγὼ δὲ καίπερ, ὡς οἶσθα, τοῖς ἔξωθεν πλεονεκτήμασιν\r\nἐπτερωμένος ὑπέταξα [C] ὅμως ἐμαυτὸν τῷ καθηγεμόνι καὶ τοῖς ἐκείνου φίλοις\r\nκαὶ ἡλικιώταις καὶ συμφοιτηταῖς, καὶ ὧν ἤκουον ἐπαινουμένων παρ᾽ αὐτοῦ,\r\nτούτων ἔσπευδον ἀκροατὴς εἶναι, καὶ βιβλία ταῦτα ἀνεγίγνωσκον, ὁπόσα αὐτὸς\r\nδοκιμάσειεν.\r\n\r\n(Now whether this be a fable or a true narrative I cannot say. But in your\r\ncomposition, whom do you mean by Pan, and whom by Zeus unless you and I\r\nare they, that is, you are Zeus and I am Pan? What an absurd counterfeit\r\nPan! But you are still more absurd, by Asclepius, and very far indeed from\r\nbeing Zeus! Is not all this the utterance of a mouth that foams with\r\nmorbid rather than inspired madness?(263) Do you not know that\r\nSalmoneus(264) in his day was punished by the gods for just this, for\r\nattempting, though a mortal man, to play the part of Zeus? Then too there\r\nis the account in Hesiod’s poems of those who styled themselves by the\r\nnames of the gods, even of Hera and of Zeus, but if you have not heard of\r\nit till this moment I can excuse you for that. For you have not been well\r\neducated, nor did fate bestow on you such a guide to the poets as I had—I\r\nmean this philosopher(265) now present: and later on I arrived at the\r\nthreshold of philosophy to be initiated therein by the teaching of\r\none(266) whom I consider superior to all the men of my own time. He used\r\nto teach me to practise virtue before all else, and to regard the gods as\r\nmy guides to all that is good. Now whether he accomplished anything of\r\nreal profit he himself must determine, or rather the ruling gods; but at\r\nleast he purged me of such infatuate folly and insolence as yours, and\r\ntried to make me more temperate than I was by nature. And though, as you\r\nknow, I was armed(267) with great external advantages, nevertheless I\r\nsubmitted myself to my preceptor and to his friends and compeers and the\r\nphilosophers of his school, and I was eager to be instructed by all whose\r\npraises I heard uttered by him, and I read all the books that he\r\napproved.)\r\n\r\nοὕτως ἡμεῖς ὑφ᾽ ἡγεμόσι τελούμενοι, φιλοσόφῳ μὲν τῷ τὰ τῆς προπαιδείας με\r\nτελέσαντι, φιλοσοφωτάτῳ δὲ τῷ τὰ πρόθυρα τῆς φιλοσοφίας δείξαντι, σμικρὰ\r\nμὲν διὰ τὰς ἔξωθεν ἡμῖν προσπεσούσας ἀσχολίας, [D] ὅμως δ᾽ οὖν ἀπελαύσαμεν\r\nτῆς ὀρθῆς ἀγωγῆς, οὐ τὴν σύντομον, ἣν σὺ φής, ἀλλὰ τὴν κύκλῳ πορευθέντες·\r\nκαίτοι νὴ τοὺς θεοὺς ἐπὶ τὴν ἀρετὴν οἶμαι ὅτι σου συντομωτέραν ἐτραπόμην.\r\nἐγὼ μὲν γὰρ αὐτῆς, εἰ μὴ φορτικὸν εἰπεῖν, ἐπὶ τοῖς προθύροις ἕστηκα, σὺ δὲ\r\nκαὶ τῶν προθύρων εἶ πόρρω. σοὶ δὲ ἀρετῆς ἢ τοῖς σοῖς ἀδελφοῖς—, ἀφελὼν δὲ\r\nτὸ δύσφημον τὸ λειπόμενον αὐτὸς ἀναπλήρωσον· εἰ βούλει δέ, καὶ παρ᾽ ἡμῶν\r\nαὐτὸ ἀνάσχου πρᾴως λεγόμενον,—τίς μετουσία; [236] πᾶσιν ἐπιτιμᾷς αὐτὸς\r\nοὐδὲν ἄξιον ἐπαίνου πράττων, ἐπαινεῖς φορτικῶς ὡς οὐδεὶς τῶν ἀμαθεστάτων\r\nῥητόρων, οἷς διὰ τὴν τῶν λόγων ἀπορίαν καὶ τὸ μὴ ἔχειν εὑρεῖν ἐκ τῶν\r\nπαρόντων ὅ, τι φῶσιν, ἡ Δῆλος ἐπέρχεται καὶ ἡ Λητὼ μετὰ τῶν παίδων, εἶτα\r\nκύκνοι λιγυρὸν ᾄδοντες καὶ ἐπηχοῦντα αὐτοῖς τὰ δένδρα, λειμῶνές τε\r\nἔνδροσοι μαλακῆς πόας καὶ βαθείας πλήρεις, ἥ τε ἐκ τῶν ἀνθέων ὀδμὴ καὶ τὸ\r\nἔαρ αὐτὸ καί τινες εἰκόνες τοιαῦται.

Though indeed I call the gods to\r\nwitness, I believe that the road I took was really a shorter road to\r\nvirtue than yours. For I, at any rate, if I may say so without bad taste,\r\nam standing at the entrance, whereas you are a long way even from the\r\nentrance. “But as for virtue, you and your brethren—,”(269) omit the ill‐\r\nsounding phrase and fill in the blank yourself! Or rather if you please,\r\nbear with me when I “put it mildly”(270)—“what part or lot have you in\r\nit?” You criticise everybody, though you yourself do nothing to deserve\r\npraise; your praises are in worse taste than those of the most ignorant\r\nrhetoricians. They, because they have nothing to say and cannot invent\r\nanything from the matter in hand, are always dragging in Delos and Leto\r\nwith her children, and then “swans singing their shrill song and the trees\r\nthat echo them,” and “dewy meadows full of soft, deep grass,” and the\r\n“scent of flowers,” and “the season of spring,” and other figures of the\r\nsame sort.(271) When did Isocrates ever do this in his panegyrics? Or when\r\ndid anyone of those ancient writers who were genuine votaries of the\r\nMuses, and not like the writers of to‐day? However, I omit what I might\r\nadd, lest I should make them also my enemies, and offend at once the most\r\nworthless Cynics and the most worthless rhetoricians. Though indeed I have\r\nnothing but friendly feelings for the really virtuous Cynics, if indeed\r\nthere be any such nowadays, and also for all honest rhetoricians. But\r\nthough a vast number of illustrations of this sort flow into my mind—for\r\nanyone who desired to use them could certainly draw from an ample\r\njar(272)—I shall refrain because of the present pressure of business.\r\nHowever I have still somewhat to add to my discourse, like the balance of\r\na debt, and before I turn to other matters let me complete this treatise.)\r\n\r\nΤίς οὖν ἡ τῶν Πυθαγορικῶν εὐλάβεια περὶ τὰ τῶν θεῶν ὀνόματα, τίς δὲ ἡ\r\nΠλάτωνος; ποταπὸς δὲ ἦν ἐν τούτοις Ἀριστοτέλης; ἆρ᾽ οὐκ ἄξιον αὐτὸ ἰδεῖν;\r\nἢ τὸν μὲν Σάμιον οὐδεὶς ἀντερεῖ τοιοῦτον γενέσθαι; καὶ γὰρ οὔτε τὸ ὀνόματα\r\nθεῶν ἐν τῆς σφραγῖδι φορεῖν ἐπέτρεπεν οὔτε τὸ ὅρκῳ χρῆσθαι προπετῶς τοῖς\r\nτῶν θεῶν ὀνόμασιν. εἰ δὲ νῦν λέγοιμι, [237] ὅτι καὶ εἰς Αἴγυπτον ἐπορεύθη\r\nκαὶ Πέρσας εἶδε καὶ πανταχοῦ πάντα ἐπειράθη τὰ μυστήρια τῶν θεῶν\r\nἐποπτεῦσαι καὶ τελεσθῆναι παντοίας πανταχοῦ τελετάς, ἐρῶ μὲν ἴσως ἄγνωστά\r\nσοι, γνώριμα μέντοι καὶ σαφῆ τοῖς πολλοῖς. ἀλλὰ τοῦ Πλάτωνος ἄκουε· τὸ δ᾽\r\nἐμὸν δέος, ὦ Πρώταρχε, πρὸς τὰ τῶν θεῶν ὀνόματα οὐκ ἔστι κατ᾽ ἄνθρωπον,\r\nἀλλὰ πέρα τοῦ μεγίστου φόβου. καὶ νῦν τὴν μὲν Ἀφροδίτην, ὅπῃ ἐκείνῃ φίλον,\r\nταύτῃ προσαγορεύω· [B] τὴν δ᾽ ἡδονὴν οἶδα ὡς ἔστι ποικίλον· ταῦτα ἐν\r\nΦιλήβῳ λέγεται, καὶ τοιαῦτα ἕτερα πάλιν ἐν Τιμαίῳ· πιστεύειν γὰρ ἁπλῶς\r\nἀξιοῖ καὶ χωρὶς ἀποδείξεως λεγομένοις, ὅσα ὑπὲρ τῶν θεῶν φασιν οἱ ποιηταί.\r\nταῦτα δὲ παρέθηκα, μή ποτέ σοι παράσχῃ πρόφασιν, ὥσπερ οἶμαι τῶν\r\nΠλατωνικῶν πολλοῖς, ὁ Σωκράτης εἴρων ὢν φύσει τὴν Πλατωνικὴν ἀτιμάσαι\r\nδόξαν. ἐκεῖ γὰρ οὐχ [C] ὁ Σωκράτης, ἀλλ᾽ ὁ Τίμαιος ταῦτα λέγει ἥκιστα ὢν\r\nεἴρων. καίτοι τοῦτό γέ ἐστιν οὐχ ὑγιὲς μὴ τὰ λεγόμενα ἐξετάζειν, ἀλλὰ τοὺς\r\nλέγοντας, καὶ τὸ πρὸς τίνας οἱ λόγοι γίγνονται. βούλει δῆτα(273) τὸ μετὰ\r\nτοῦτο τὴν πάνσοφον ὑπαγορεύσω σειρῆνα, τὸν τοῦ λογίου τύπον Ἑρμοῦ, τὸν τῷ\r\nἈπόλλωνι καὶ ταῖς Μούσαις φίλον; ἐκεῖνος ἀξιοῖ τοὺς ἐπερωτῶντας ἢ ζητεῖν\r\nὅλως ἐπιχειροῦντας, εἰ θεοί εἰσιν, οὐχ ὡς ἀνθρώπους ἀποκρίσεως τυγχάνειν,\r\nἀλλ᾽ ὡς [D] τὰ θηρία κολάσεως. εἰ δὲ ἀνεγνώκεις τὸν συστατικὸν(274) αὐτοῦ\r\nλόγον, ὃς ὥσπερ τῆς Πλάτωνος, οὕτω δὴ(275) καὶ τῆς ἐκείνου διατριβῆς\r\nπρουγέγραπτο, ἔγνως ἂν πρὸ πάντων, ὅτι τὰ πρὸς τοὺς θεοὺς εὐσεβεῖς εἶναι\r\nκαὶ μεμυῆσθαι πάντα τὰ μυστήρια καὶ τετελέσθαι τὰς ἁγιωτάτας τελετὰς καὶ\r\nδιὰ πάντων τῶν μαθημάτων ἦχθαι τοῖς εἴσω τοῦ περιπάτου βαδίζουσι\r\nπροηγόρευτο.(276)\r\n\r\n(I ask you then what reverence for the names of the gods was shown by the\r\nPythagoreans and by Plato? What was Aristotle’s attitude in these matters?\r\nIs it not worth while to pay attention to this? Or surely no one will deny\r\nthat he of Samos(277) was reverent? For he did not even allow the names of\r\nthe gods to be used on a seal, nor oaths to be rashly uttered in the names\r\nof the gods. And if I should go on to say that he also travelled to Egypt\r\nand visited Persia, and everywhere endeavoured to be admitted to the inner\r\nmysteries of the gods and everywhere to be initiated into every kind of\r\nrite, I shall be saying what is familiar and obvious to most people,\r\nthough you may not have heard of it. However, listen to what Plato says:\r\n“But for my part, Protarchus, I feel a more than human awe, indeed a fear\r\nbeyond expression, of the names of the gods. Now therefore I will address\r\nAphrodite by whatever name pleases her best; though as for pleasure, I\r\nknow that it has many forms.” This is what he says in the Philebus(278)\r\nand he says the same sort of thing again in the Timaeus.(279) For he says\r\nthat we ought to believe directly and without proof what we are told, I\r\nmean what the poets say about the gods. And I have brought forward this\r\npassage for fear that Socrates may furnish you with an excuse,—as I\r\nbelieve he does to many Platonists because of his natural tendency to\r\nirony,—to slight the doctrine of Plato. For it is not Socrates who is\r\nspeaking here, but Timaeus, who had not the least tendency to irony.\r\nThough for that matter it is not a sound principle to enquire who says a\r\nthing and to whom, rather than the actual words. But now will you allow me\r\nto cite next that all‐wise Siren, the living image of Hermes the god of\r\neloquence, the man dear to Apollo and the Muses?(280) Well, he declares\r\nthat all who raise the question or seek to enquire at all whether gods\r\nexist ought not to be answered as though they were men but to be chastised\r\nas wild beasts. And if you had read that introductory sentence which was\r\ninscribed over the entrance to his school, like Plato’s, you would most\r\nsurely know that those who entered the Lyceum were warned to be reverent\r\nto the gods, to be initiated into all the mysteries, to take part in the\r\nmost sacred ceremonies, and to be instructed in knowledge of every kind.)\r\n\r\n[238] Σὺ δὲ ὅπως ἡμῖν μὴ τὸν Διογένη προβαλὼν ὥσπερ τι μορμολυκεῖον\r\nἐκφοβήσεις.(281) οὐ γὰρ ἐμυήθη, φασίν, ἀλλὰ καὶ πρὸς τὸν προτρεπόμενον\r\nμυηθῆναι, Γελοῖον, εἶπεν, ὦ νεανίσκε, εἰ τοὺς μὲν τελώνας οἴει ταύτης\r\nἕνεκα τῆς τελετῆς κοινωνήσειν τοῖς ὁσίοις τῶν ἐν ᾅδου καλῶν, Ἀγησίλαον δὲ\r\nκαὶ Ἐπαμεινώνδαν ἐν τῷ βορβόρῳ κείσεσθαι. τοῦτο, ὦ νεανίσκε, βαθὺ λίαν\r\nἐστὶ καὶ δεόμενον ἐξηγήσεως, [B] ὡς ἐμαυτὸν πείθω, μείζονος, ὁποίας(282)\r\nἡμῖν αὐταὶ δοῖεν αἱ θεαὶ τὴν ἐπίνοιαν; νομίζω δὲ αὐτὴν ἤδη καὶ δεδόσθαι.\r\nφαίνεται γὰρ ὁ Διογένης οὐχ, ὥσπερ ὑμεῖς ἀξιοῦτε, δυσσεβής, ἀλλ᾽ ἐκείνοις,\r\nὧν μικρῷ πρόσθεν ἐπεμνήσθην, προσόμοιος. ἀπιδὼν γὰρ εἰς τὴν περίστασιν τὴν\r\nκαταλαβοῦσαν αὐτόν, εἶτα εἰς τὰς ἐντολὰς βλέπων τοῦ Πυθίου καὶ\r\nσυνιεὶς(283) ὅτι τὸν μυούμενον ἐχρῆν πολιτογραφηθῆναι πρότερον καὶ\r\nἈθηναῖον, [C] εἰ καὶ μὴ φύσει, τῷ νόμῳ γε γενέσθαι, τοῦτο ἔφυγεν, οὐ τὸ\r\nμυηθῆναι, νομίζων αὑτὸν εἶναι τοῦ κόσμου πολίτην, καὶ ταῖς ὅλαις τῶν θεῶν\r\nοὐσίαις, αἳ τὸν ὅλον κοινῇ κόσμον ἐπιτροπεύουσιν, ἀλλ᾽ οὐ ταῖς τὰ μέρη\r\nκατανειμαμέναις αὐτοῦ, διὰ μεγαλοφροσύνην ἀξιῶν συμπολιτεύεσθαι· τό τε\r\nνόμιμον οὐ παρέβη αἰδοῖ τῶν θεῶν, καίτοι τἆλλα πατῶν καὶ παραχαράττων·\r\nαὑτόν [D] τε οὐκ ἐπανήγαγεν, ὄθεν ἄσμενος ἠλευθέρωτο. τί δ᾽ ἦν τοῦτο; τὸ\r\nπόλεως μιᾶς δουλεῦσαι νόμοις ἑαυτόν τε ὑποθεῖναι τούτῳ, ὅπερ ἦν ἀνάγκη\r\nπαθεῖν Ἀθηναίῳ γενομένῳ. πῶς γὰρ οὐκ ἔμελλεν ὁ τῶν θεῶν ἕνεκεν εἰς\r\nὈλυμπίαν βαδίζων, ὁ τῷ Πυθίῳ πεισθεὶς καὶ φιλοσοφήσας ὥσπερ Σωκράτης· φησὶ\r\nγὰρ καὶ αὐτὸς εἶναι Πύθιον οἴκοι παρ᾽ ἑαυτῷ, ὅθεν αὐτῷ καὶ ἡ ὁρμὴ πρὸς\r\nφιλοσοφίαν ἐγένετο· [239] παριέναι τῶν ἀνακτόρων εἴσω καὶ μάλα ἀσμένως, εἰ\r\nμὴ τοῦτο ἐξέκλινε τὸ ὑποθεῖναι νόμοις ἑαυτὸν καὶ δοῦλον ἀποφῆναι\r\nπολιτείας; ἀλλὰ διὰ τί μὴ ταύτην αὐτὴν εἶπε τὴν αἰτίαν, ἐκ τῶν ἐναντίων δὲ\r\nτὴν παραιρουμένην οὐ σμικρὰ τῆς τῶν μυστηρίων σεμνότητος; ἴσως μὲν ἄν τις\r\nτὰ τοιαῦτα καὶ Πυθαγόρᾳ μάλιστα ἐπισκήψειεν, οὐκ ὀρθῶς λογιζόμενος. οὔτε\r\nγὰρ ῥητέον πάντα ἐστίν, αὐτῶν τε οἶμαι τούτων, ὧν θέμις φάναι, ἔνια πρὸς\r\nτοὺς πολλοὺς σιωπητέον εἶναί μοι φαίνεται.

He was never initiated, they tell us, and replied to some one who\r\nonce advised him to be initiated: “It is absurd of you, my young friend,\r\nto think that any tax‐gatherer, if only he be initiated, can share in the\r\nrewards of the just in the next world, while Agesilaus and Epameinondas\r\nare doomed to lie in the mire.”(286) Now this, my young friend, is a very\r\nhard saying and, I am persuaded, calls for more profound discussion. May\r\nthe goddesses themselves grant us understanding thereof! Though indeed I\r\nthink that has already been bestowed by them. For it is evident that\r\nDiogenes was not impious, as you aver, but resembled those philosophers\r\nwhom I mentioned a moment ago. For having regard to the circumstances in\r\nwhich his lot was cast, and next paying heed to the commands of the\r\nPythian god, and knowing that the candidate for initiation must first be\r\nregistered as an Athenian citizen, and if he be not an Athenian by birth\r\nmust first become one by law, it was this he avoided, not initiation,\r\nbecause he considered that he was a citizen of the world; and moreover\r\nsuch was the greatness of his soul that he thought he ought to associate\r\nhimself with the divine nature of all the gods who in common govern the\r\nwhole universe, and not only with those whose functions are limited to\r\ncertain portions of it. And out of reverence for the gods he did not\r\ntransgress their laws, though he trampled on all other opinions and tried\r\nto give a new stamp to the common currency. And he did not return to that\r\nservitude from which he had joyfully been released. What servitude do I\r\nmean? I mean that he would not enslave himself to the laws of a single\r\ncity and submit himself to all that must needs befall one who had become\r\nan Athenian citizen. For is it likely that a man who in order to honour\r\nthe gods journeyed to Olympia, and like Socrates embraced philosophy in\r\nobedience to the Pythian oracle,—for he says himself that at home and in\r\nprivate he received the commands of that oracle and hence came his impulse\r\nto philosophy(287)—is it likely I say that such a man would not very\r\ngladly have entered the temples of the gods but for the fact that he was\r\ntrying to avoid submitting himself to any set of laws and making himself\r\nthe slave of any one constitution? But why, you will say, did he not\r\nassign this reason, but on the contrary a reason that detracted not a\r\nlittle from the dignity of the Mysteries? Perhaps one might bring this\r\nsame reproach against Pythagoras as well, but the reasoning would be\r\nincorrect. For everything ought not to be told, nay more, even of those\r\nthings that we are permitted to declare, some, it seems to me, we ought to\r\nrefrain from uttering to the vulgar crowd.(288) However the explanation in\r\nthis case is obvious. For since he perceived that the man who exhorted him\r\nto be initiated neglected to regulate his own life aright, though he\r\nprided himself on having been initiated, Diogenes wished at the same time\r\nto reform his morals and to teach him that the gods reserve their rewards\r\nwithout stint for those whose lives have earned them the right to be\r\ninitiated, even though they have not gone through the ceremony, whereas\r\nthe wicked gain nothing by penetrating within the sacred precincts. For\r\nthis is what the hierophant proclaims, when he refuses the rite of\r\ninitiation to him “whose hands are not pure or who for any reason ought\r\nnot!(289)”)\r\n\r\nΤί πέρας ἡμῖν ἔσται τῶν λόγων, εἰ ταῦτα μήπω σε πείθει;\r\n\r\n(But where would this discourse end if you are still unconvinced by what I\r\nhave said?)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORATION VIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction to Oration VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Eighth Oration is a “speech of consolation” (παραμυθητικὸς λόγος), a\r\nfamiliar type of Sophistic composition. In consequence of the attacks on\r\nSallust by sycophants at court, and moreover jealous of his friendship\r\nwith Julian, Constantius ordered him to leave Gaul. In this discourse,\r\nwhich was written before the open rupture with Constantius, Julian alludes\r\nonly once and respectfully to his cousin. But Asmus thinks he can detect\r\nin it a general resemblance to the Thirteenth Oration of Dio Chrysostom,\r\nwhere Dio tries to comfort himself for his banishment by the tyrant\r\nDomitian, and that Sallust was expected to appreciate this and the veiled\r\nattack on Constantius. Julian addresses the discourse to himself, but it\r\nwas no doubt sent to Sallust.\r\n\r\nAfter Julian’s accession Sallust was made prefect in 362 and consul in\r\n363. He was the author of a manifesto of Neo‐Platonism, the treatise _On\r\nthe Gods and the World_, and to him was dedicated Julian’s Fourth\r\nOration.(290)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nΙΟΥΛΙΑΝΟΥ ΚΑΙΣΑΡΟΣ\r\n\r\n(Julian, Emperor)\r\n\r\n[240] ΕΠΙ ΤΗΙ ΕΞΟΔΩΙ ΤΟΥ ΑΓΑΘΩΤΑΤΟΥ ΣΑΛΟΥΣΤΙΟΥ ΠΑΡΑΜΥΘΗΤΙΚΟΣ ΕΙΣ ΕΑΥΤΟΝ\r\n\r\n(A Consolation to Himself Upon The Departure of the Excellent Sallust)\r\n\r\nἉλλ᾽ εἰ μὴ καὶ πρὸς σὲ διαλεχθείην ὅσα πρὸς ἐμαυτὸν διελέχθην, ἐπειδή σε\r\nβαδίζειν ἐπυθόμην χρῆναι παρ᾽ ἡμῶν, ἔλαττον ἔχειν οἰήσομαι πρὸς παραψυχήν,\r\nὦ φίλε ἑταῖρε, μᾶλλον δὲ οὐδὲ τὴν ἀρχὴν πεπορίσθαι τινὰ ῥᾳστώνην ἐμαυτῷ\r\nνομιῶ, ἧς σοί γε οὐ μεταδέδωκα.

For we two have shared in many sorrows and also\r\nin many pleasant deeds and words, in affairs private and public, at home\r\nand in the field, and therefore for the present troubles, be they what\r\nthey may, we must needs discover some cure, some remedy that both can\r\nshare. But who will imitate for us the lyre of Orpheus, who will echo for\r\nus the songs of the Sirens or discover the drug nepenthe?(294) Though that\r\nwas perhaps some tale full of Egyptian lore or such a tale as the poet\r\nhimself invented, when in what follows he wove in the story of the sorrows\r\nof the Trojans, and Helen had learned it from the Egyptians; I do not mean\r\na tale of all the woes that the Greeks and Trojans inflicted on one\r\nanother, but rather tales such as they must be that will dispel the griefs\r\nof men’s souls and have power to restore cheerfulness and calm. For\r\npleasure and pain, methinks, are connected at their source(295) and\r\nsucceed each other in turn. And philosophers assert that in all that\r\nbefalls the wise man the very greatest trials afford him as much felicity\r\nas vexation; and thus, as they say, does the bee extract sweet dew from\r\nthe bitterest herb that grows on Hymettus and works it into honey.(296)\r\nEven so bodies that are naturally healthy and robust are nourished by any\r\nkind of food, and food that often seems unwholesome for others, far from\r\ninjuring them, makes them strong. On the other hand, the slightest causes\r\nusually inflict very serious injuries on persons who by nature or nurture,\r\nor owing to their habits, have an unsound constitution and are lifelong\r\ninvalids. Just so with regard to the mind: those who have so trained it\r\nthat it is not altogether unhealthy but moderately sound, though it do not\r\nindeed exhibit the vigour of Antisthenes or Socrates, or the courage of\r\nCallisthenes, or the imperturbability of Polemon, but so that it can under\r\nthe same conditions as theirs adopt the golden mean, they, I say, will\r\nprobably be able to remain cheerful in more trying conditions.)\r\n\r\nἘγώ τοι καὶ αὐτὸς πεῖραν ἐμαυτοῦ λαμβάνων, ὅπως πρὸς τὴν σὴν πορείαν ἔχω\r\nτε καὶ ἕξω, τοσοῦτον ὠδυνήθην, ὅσον ὅτε πρῶτον τὸν ἐμαυτοῦ καθηγεμόνα\r\nκατέλιπον οἴκοι· πάντων γὰρ ἀθρόως εἰσῄει με μνήμη, τῆς τῶν πόνων\r\nκοινωνίας, ὧν ἀλλήλοις συνδιηνέγκαμεν, τῆς ἀπλάστου καὶ καθαρᾶς ἐντεύξεως,\r\n[D] τῆς ἀδόλου καὶ δικαίας ὁμιλίας, τῆς ἐν ἅπασι τοῖς καλοῖς κοινοπραγίας,\r\nτῆς πρὸς τοὺς πονηροὺς ἰσορρόπου τε καὶ ἀμεταμελήτου προθυμίας τε καὶ\r\nὁρμῆς, ὡς μετ᾽ ἀλλήλων ἔστημεν πολλάκις ἶσον θυμὸν ἔχοντες, ὁμότροποι καὶ\r\nποθεινοὶ φίλοι. πρὸς δὲ αὖ τούτοις εἰσῄει με μνήμη τοῦ ΟἸώθη δ᾽ Ὀδυσεύς·\r\nεἰμὶ γὰρ ἐγὼ νῦν ἐκείνῳ παραπλήσιοδςσ, ἐπεὶ σὲ μὲν κατὰ τὸν Ἕκτορα θεὸς\r\nἐξήγαγεν ἔξω βελῶν, ὧν οἱ συκοφάνται [242] πολλάκις ἀφῆκαν ἐπὶ σέ, μᾶλλον\r\nδὲ εἰς ἐμέ, διὰ σοῦ τρῶσαι βουλόμενοι, ταύτῃ με μόνον ἁλώσιμον\r\nὑπολαμβάνοντες, εἰ τοῦ πιστοῦ φίλου καὶ προθύμου συνασπιστοῦ καὶ πρὸς τοὺς\r\nκινδύνους ἀπροφασίστου κοινωνοῦ τῆς συνουσίας στερήσειαν. οὐ μὴν ἔλαττον\r\nοἶμαί σε διὰ τοῦτο ἀλγεῖν ἢ ἐγὼ νῦν, ὅτι σοι τῶν πόνων καὶ τῶν κινδύνων\r\nἔλαττον μέτεστιν, [B] ἀλλὰ καὶ πλέον ὑπὲρ ἐμοῦ δεδιέναι καὶ τῆς ἐμῆς\r\nκεφαλῆς, μή τι πάθῃ. καὶ γάρ τοι καὶ αὐτὸς οὐκ ἐν δευτέρῳ τῶν ἐμὼν ἐθέμην\r\nτὰ σά, καὶ σοῦ δὲ ὁμοίως ἔχοντος πρὸς ἡμᾶς ᾐσθόμην. ὅθεν εἰκότως καὶ μάλα\r\nδάκνομαι, ὅτι σοι, τῶν ἄλλων ἕνεκα λέγειν δυναμένῳ\r\n\r\n(For my part, when I put myself to the proof to find out how I am and\r\nshall be affected by your departure, I felt the same anguish as when at\r\nhome I first left my preceptor.(297) For everything flashed across my mind\r\nat once; the labours that we shared and endured together; our unfeigned\r\nand candid conversation; our innocent and upright intercourse; our co‐\r\noperation in all that was good; our equally‐matched and never‐repented\r\nzeal and eagerness in opposing evildoers. How often we supported each\r\nother with one equal temper!(298) How alike were our ways! How precious\r\nour friendship! Then too there came into my mind the words, “Then was\r\nOdysseus left alone.”(299) For now I am indeed like him, since the god has\r\nremoved you, like Hector,(300) beyond the range of the shafts which have\r\nso often been aimed at you by sycophants, or rather at me, since they\r\ndesired to wound me through you; for they thought that only thus should I\r\nbe vulnerable if they should deprive me of the society of a faithful\r\nfriend and devoted brother‐in‐arms—one who never on any pretext failed to\r\nshare the dangers that threatened me. Moreover the fact that you now have\r\na smaller share than I in such labours and dangers does not, I think, make\r\nyour grief less than mine; but you feel all the more anxiety for me and\r\nany harm that may befall my person.(301) For even as I never set your\r\ninterests second to mine, so have I ever found you equally well disposed\r\ntowards me. I am therefore naturally much chagrined that to you who with\r\nregard to all others can say,)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Οὐδὲν μέλει μοι· τἀμὰ γὰρ καλῶς ἔχει,\r\n    Μόνος εἰμὶ [C] λύπης αἴτιος καὶ φροντίδος.(302)\r\n\r\n    (“I heed them not, for my affairs are prosperous,”(303) I alone\r\n    occasion sorrow and anxiety.)\r\n\r\n\r\nἀλλὰ τούτου μὲν ἐξ ἴσης, ὡς ἔοικε, κοινωνοῦμεν, σὺ μὲν ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν ἀλγῶν\r\nμόνον, ἐγὼ δὲ ἀεὶ ποθῶν τὴν σὴν συνουσίαν καὶ τῆς φιλίας μεμνημένος, ἣν ἐκ\r\nτῆς ἀρετῆς μὲν μάλιστα καὶ προηγουμένως, ἔπειτα καὶ διὰ τὴν χρείαν, ἣν ἐγὼ\r\nμὲν σοί, σὺ δὲ ἐμοὶ συνεχῶς παρέσχες, ἀνακραθέντες ἀλλήλοις ὡμολογήσαμεν,\r\nοὐχ ὅρκοις οὐδὲ τοιαύταις ἀνάγκαις ταῦτα πιστούμενοι, [D] ὥσπερ ὁ Θησεὺς\r\nκαὶ ὁ Πειρίθους, ἀλλ᾽ ἐξ ὧν ἀεὶ ταὐτὰ νοοῦντες καὶ προαιρούμενοι κακὸν μὲν\r\nδοῦναι τῶν πολιτῶν τινι τοσοῦτον δέω λέγειν ἀπέσχομεν, ὥστε οὐδὲ\r\nἐβουλευσάμεθά ποτε μετὰ ἀλλήλων· χρηστὸν δὲ εἴ τι γέγονεν ἢ βεβούλευται\r\nκοινῇ παρ᾽ ἡμῶν, τοῦτο ἄλλοις εἰπεῖν μελήσει.\r\n\r\n(However this sorrow it seems we share equally, though you grieve only on\r\nmy account, while I constantly feel the lack of your society and call to\r\nmind the friendship that we pledged to one another—that friendship which\r\nwe ever cemented afresh, based as it was, first and foremost, on virtue,\r\nand secondly on the obligations which you continually conferred on me and\r\nI on you. Not by oaths or by any such ties did we ratify it, like Theseus\r\nand Peirithous, but by being of the same mind and purpose, in that so far\r\nfrom forbearing to inflict injury on any citizen, we never even debated\r\nany such thing with one another. But whether anything useful was done or\r\nplanned by us in common, I will leave to others to say.)\r\n\r\nὩς μὲν οὖν εἰκότως ἀλγῶ τοῖς παροῦσιν, οὐ φίλου μόνον, ἀλλὰ καὶ συνεργοῦ\r\nπιστοῦ, [243] δοίη δὲ ὁ δαίμων, καὶ πρὸς ὀλίγον ἀπαλλαττόμενος, οἶμαι καὶ\r\nΣωκράτη τὸν μέγαν τῆς ἀρετῆς κήρυκα καὶ διδάσκαλον ἔμοιγε συνομολογήσειν\r\nἐξ ὧν ἐκεῖνον γνωρίζομεν, λέγω δὲ τῶν Πλάτωνος λόγων, τεκμαιρόμενος ὑπὲρ\r\nαὐτοῦ. φησὶ γοῦν ὅτι Χαλεπώτερον ἐφαίνετό μοι ὀρθῶς τὰ πολιτικὰ διοικεῖν·\r\nοὔτε γὰρ ἄνευ φίλων ἀνδρῶν καὶ ἑταίρων πιστῶν οἷόν τε εἶναι πράττειν, οὔτ᾽\r\nεὐπορεῖν τούτων ξὺν πολλῇ ῥᾳστώνῃ. καίτοι τοῦτό γε εἰ Πλάτωνι μεῖζον\r\nἐφαίνετο τοῦ διορύττειν [B] τὸν Ἄθω, τί χρὴ προσδοκᾶν ἡμᾶς ὑπὲρ αὐτοῦ τοὺς\r\nπλέον ἀπολειπομένους τῆς ἐκείνου συνέσεώς τε καὶ γνώμης ἢ ἐκεῖνος τοῦ\r\nθεοῦ; ἐμοὶ δὲ οὐδὲ τῆς χρείας μόνον ἕνεκα, ἣν ἀντιδιδόντες ἀλλήλοις ἐν τῇ\r\nπολιτείᾳ ῥᾷον εἴχομεν πρὸς τὰ παρὰ γνώμην ὑπὸ τῆς τύχης καὶ τῶν\r\nἀντιταττομένων ἡμῖν πραττόμενα, ἀλλὰ(304) καὶ τῆς μόνης ἀεί μοι θαλπωρῆς\r\nτε καὶ τέρψεως [C] ἐνδεὴς οὐκ εἰς μακρὰν ἔσεσθαι μέλλων, εἰκότως δάκνομαί\r\nτε καὶ δέδηγμαι τὴν ἐμαυτοῦ καρδίαν. ἐς τίνα γὰρ οὕτως ἔσται μοι λοιπὸν\r\nεὔνουν ἀποβλέψαι φίλον; τίνος δὲ ἀνασχέσθαι τῆς ἀδόλου καὶ καθαρᾶς\r\nπαρρησίας; τίς δὲ ἡμῖν συμβουλεύσει μὲν ἐμφρόνως, ἐπιτιμήσει δὲ μετ᾽\r\nεὐνοίας, ἐπιρρώσει δὲ πρὸς τὰ καλὰ χωρὶς αὐθαδείας καὶ τύφου,\r\nπαρρησιάσεται δὲ τὸ πικρὸν ἀφελὼν τῶν λόγων, [D] ὥσπερ οἱ τῶν φαρμάκων\r\nἀφαιροῦντες μὲν τὸ λίαν δυσχερές, ἀπολείποντες δὲ αὐτὸ τὸ χρήσιμον; ἀλλὰ\r\nτοῦτο μὲν ἐκ τῆς σῆς φιλίας ὄφελος ἐκαρπωσάμην. τοσούτων δὲ ὁμοῦ\r\nἐστερημένος, τίνων ἂν εὐπορήσαιμι λόγων, οἵ με, διὰ τὸν σὸν πόθον σά τε\r\nμήδεα σήν τε ἀγανοφροσύνην αὐτὴν προέσθαι τὴν ψυχὴν κινδυνεύοντα,\r\nπείσουσιν ἀτρεμεῖν καὶ φέρειν ὅσα δέδωκεν ὁ θεὸς γενναίως; [244] εἰς ταὐτὸ\r\nγὰρ ἔοικεν αὐτῷ νοῶν ὁ μέγας αὐτοκράτωρ ταῦθ᾽ οὕτω νυνὶ βουλεύσασθαι. τί\r\nποτε οὖν ἄρα χρὴ διανοηθέντα καὶ τίνας ἐπῳδὰς εὑρόντα πεῖσαι πρᾴως ἔχειν\r\nὑπὸ τοῦ πάθους θορυβουμένην τὴν ψυχήν; ἆρα ἡμῖν οἱ Ζαμόλξιδός εἰσι\r\nμιμητέοι λόγοι, λέγω δὲ τὰς ἐκ Θρᾴκης ἐπῳδάς, ἃς Ἀθήναζε φέρων ὁ Σωκράτης\r\nπρὸ τοῦ τὴν ὀδύνην ἰᾶσθαι τῆς κεφαλῆς ἐπᾴδειν ἠξίου τῷ καλῷ Χαρμίδῃ; ἢ\r\nτούτους μὲν ἅτε δὴ μείζονας καὶ περὶ μειζόνων οὐ κινητέον, ὥσπερ ἐν θεάτρῳ\r\nμικρῷ μηχανὰς μεγάλας, [B] ἀλλ᾽ ἐκ τῶν ἔμπροσθεν ἔργων, ὧν ἐπυθόμεθα τὰ\r\nκλέα, φησὶν ὁ ποιητῆς, ὥσπερ ἐκ λειμῶνος δρεψάμενοι ποικίλου καὶ\r\nπολυειδοῦς(305) ἄνθη τὰ κάλλιστα ψυχαγωγήσομεν αὑτοὺς τοῖς διηγήμασι,\r\nμικρὰ τῶν ἐκ φιλοσοφίας αὐτοῖς προστιθέντες; ὥσπερ γὰρ οἶμαι τοῖς λίαν\r\nγλυκέσιν οἱ παρεγχέοντες οὐκ οἶδ᾽ ὁποῖ ἄττα φάρμακα τὸ προσκορὲς αὐτῶν\r\nἀφαιροῦσιν, οὕτω τοῖς διηγήμασιν ἐκ φιλοσοφίας ἔνια προστιθέμενα τὸ δοκεῖν\r\nἐξ [C] ἱστορίας ἀρχαίας ὄχλον ἐπεισάγειν, οὐδὲν δέον, καὶ περιττὴν\r\nἀδολεσχίαν ἀφαιρεῖται.\r\n\r\n(Now that it is natural for me to be grieved by the present event, on\r\nbeing parted for ever so short a time—and God grant that it may be\r\nshort!—from one who is not only my friend but my loyal fellow‐worker, I\r\nthink even Socrates, that great herald and teacher of virtue, will agree;\r\nso far at least as I may judge from the evidence on which we rely for our\r\nknowledge of him, I mean the words of Plato. At my rate, what he says is:\r\n“Ever more difficult did it seem to me to govern a state rightly. For\r\nneither is it possible to achieve anything without good friends and loyal\r\nfellow‐workers, nor is it very easy to obtain enough of these.”(306) And\r\nif Plato thought this more difficult than digging a canal through Mount\r\nAthos,(307) what must we expect to find it, we who in wisdom and knowledge\r\nare more inferior to him than he was to God? But it is not only when I\r\nthink of the help in the administration that we gave one another in turn,\r\nand which enabled us to bear more easily all that fate or our opponents\r\nbrought to pass contrary to our purpose; but also because I am destined\r\nsoon to be bereft also of what has ever been my only solace and delight,\r\nit is natural that I am and have been cut to the very heart.(308) For in\r\nthe future to what friend can I turn as loyal as yourself? With whose\r\nguileless and pure frankness shall I now brace myself? Who now will give\r\nme prudent counsel, reprove me with affection, give me strength for good\r\ndeeds without arrogance and conceit, and use frankness after extracting\r\nthe bitterness from the words, like those who from medicines extract what\r\nis nauseating but leave in what is really beneficial?(309) These are the\r\nadvantages that I reaped from your friendship! And now that I have been\r\ndeprived of all these all at once, with what arguments shall I supply\r\nmyself, so that when I am in danger of flinging away my life out of regret\r\nfor you and your counsels and loving kindness,(310) they may persuade me\r\nto be calm and to bear nobly whatever God has sent?(311) For in accordance\r\nwith the will of God our mighty Emperor has surely planned this as all\r\nelse. Then what now must be my thoughts, what spells must I find to\r\npersuade my soul to bear tranquilly the trouble with which it is now\r\ndismayed? Shall I imitate the discourses of Zamolxis(312)—I mean those\r\nThracian spells which Socrates brought to Athens and declared that he must\r\nutter them over the fair Charmides before he could cure him of his\r\nheadache?(313) Or must we leave these alone as being, like large machinery\r\nin a small theatre, too lofty for our purpose and suited to greater\r\ntroubles; and rather from the deeds of old whose fame we have heard told,\r\nas the poet says,(314) shall we gather the fairest flowers as though from\r\na variegated and many‐coloured meadow, and thus console ourselves with\r\nsuch narratives and add thereto some of the teachings of philosophy? For\r\njust as, for instance, certain drugs are infused into things that have too\r\nsweet a taste, and thus their cloying sweetness is tempered, so when tales\r\nlike these are seasoned by the maxims of philosophy, we avoid seeming to\r\ndrag in a tedious profusion of ancient history and a superfluous and\r\nuncalled‐for flow of words.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Τί πρῶτον; τί δ᾽ ἔπειτα; τί δ᾽ ὑστάτιον καταλέξω;\r\n\r\n    (“What first, what next, what last shall I relate?”(315))\r\n\r\n\r\nπότερον ὡς ὁ Σκηπίων ἐκεῖνος, ὁ τὸν Λαίλιον ἀγαπήσας καὶ φιληθεὶς τὸ\r\nλεγόμενον ἴσῳ ζυγῷ παρ᾽ ἐκείνου πάλιν, ἡδέως μὲν αὐτῷ συνῆν, ἔπραττε δὲ\r\nοὐδέν, ὧν μὴ πρότερον ἐκεῖνος πύθοιτο καὶ φήσειεν εἶναι πρακτέον; ὅθεν\r\nοἶμαι καὶ λόγον παρέσχε [D] τοῖς ὑπὸ φθόνου τὸν Σκηπίωνα λοιδοροῦσιν, ὡς\r\nποιητὴς μὲν ὁ Λαίλιος εἴη τῶν ἔργων, Ἁφρικανὸς δὲ ὁ τούτων ὑποκριτής. αὕτη\r\nτοι καὶ ἡμῖν ἡ φήμη πρόσκειται, καὶ οὐ μόνον οὐ δυχεραίνω(316) χαίρω δὲ\r\nἐπ᾽ αὐτῇ πλέον. τὸ γὰρ τοῖς ὀρθῶς ὑπ᾽ ἄλλου γνωσθεῖσι πεισθῆναι μείζονος\r\nἀρετῆς(317) ὁ Ζήνων ποιεῖται γνώρισμα [245] τοῦ γνῶναί τινα αὐτὸν ἐξ αὑτοῦ\r\nτὰ δέοντα, τὴν Ἡσιόδου μεθαρμόττων ῥῆσιν,\r\n\r\n(Shall I tell how the famous Scipio, who loved Laelius and was loved by\r\nhim in return with equal yoke of friendship,(318) as the saying is, not\r\nonly took pleasure in his society, but undertook no task without first\r\nconsulting with him and obtaining his advice as to how he should proceed?\r\nIt was this, I understand, that furnished those who from envy slandered\r\nScipio with the saying that Laelius was the real author of his\r\nenterprises, and Africanus merely the actor. The same remark is made about\r\nourselves, and, far from resenting this, I rather rejoice at it. For to\r\naccept another’s good advice Zeno held to be a sign of greater virtue than\r\nindependently to decide oneself what one ought to do; and so he altered\r\nthe saying of Hesiod; for Zeno says:)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Οὗτος μὲν πανάριστος, ὃς εὖ εἰπόντι πίθηται\r\n\r\n    (“That man is best who follows good advice” instead of “decides\r\n    all things for himself.”(319))\r\n\r\n\r\nλέγων ἀντὶ τοῦ νοήσῃ πάνθ᾽ ἑαυτῷ. ἐμοὶ δὲ οὐ διὰ τοῦτο χαρίεν εἶναι δοκεῖ·\r\nπείθομαι γὰρ ἀληθέστερον μὲν Ἡσίοδον λέγειν, ἀμφοῖν δὲ ἄμεινον Πυθαγόραν,\r\nὃς καὶ τῇ παροιμίᾳ παρέσχε τὴν ἀρχὴν καὶ τὸ λέγεσθαι κοινὰ τὰ φίλων ἔδωκε\r\nτῷ βίῳ, οὐ δήπου τὰ χρήματα λέγων μόνον, [B] ἀλλὰ καὶ τὴν τοῦ νοῦ καὶ τῆς\r\nφρονήσεως κοινωνίαν, ὥσθ᾽ ὅσα μὲν εὗρες αὐτός, οὐδὲν ἔλαττον ταῦτα τοῦ\r\nπεισθέντος ἐστίν, ὅσα δὲ τῶν σῶν ὑπεκρινάμην, τούτων αὐτῶν εἰκότως τὸ ἴσον\r\nμετέχεις. ἀλλὰ ταῦτα μὲν ὁποτέρου μᾶλλον ἂν φαίνηται, καὶ(320) θατέρῳ\r\nπροσήκει, καὶ τοῖς βασκάνοις οὐδὲν ἔσται πλέον ἐκ τῶν λόγων.\r\n\r\n(Not that the alteration is to my liking. For I am convinced that what\r\nHesiod says is truer, that Pythagoras was wiser than either of them when\r\nhe originated the proverb and gave to mankind the maxim, “Friends have all\r\nthings in common.”(321) And by this he certainly did not mean money only,\r\nbut also a partnership in intelligence and wisdom. So all that you\r\nsuggested belongs just as much to me who adopted it, and whenever I was\r\nthe actor who carried out your plans you naturally have an equal share in\r\nthe performance. In fact, to whichever of us the credit may seem to\r\nbelong, it belongs equally to the other, and malicious persons will gain\r\nnothing from their gossip.)\r\n\r\nἩμῖν δὲ ἐπανιτέον ἐπὶ τὸν Ἀφρικανὸν καὶ τὸν Λαίλιον. ἐπειδὴ γὰρ ἀνῄρητο\r\nμὲν ἡ Καρχηδὼν καὶ τὰ περὶ [C] τὴν Λιβύην ἅπαντα τῆς Ῥώμης ἐγεγόνει δοῦλα,\r\nπέμπει μὲν Ἀφρικανὸς τὸν Λαίλιον· ἀνήγετο δὲ ἐκεῖνος εὐαγγέλια τῇ πατρίδι\r\nφέρων· καὶ ὁ Σκηπίων ἤχθετο μὲν ἀπολειπόμενος τοῦ φίλου, οὐ μὴν\r\nἀπαραμύθητον αὑτῷ τὸ πάθος ᾤετο. καὶ τὸν Λαίλιον δὲ δυσχεραίνειν εἰκός,\r\nἐπειδὴ μόνος ἀνήγετο, οὐ μὴν ἀφόρητον ἐποιεῖτο τὴν συμφοράν. ἔπλει καὶ\r\nΚάτων ἀπολιπὼν οἴκοι τοὺς αὑτοῦ συνήθεις, καὶ Πυθαγόρας, καὶ Πλάτων καὶ\r\nΔημόκριτος οὐδένα παραλαβόντες κοινωνὸν τῆς ὁδοῦ, [D] καίτοι πολλοὺς οἴκοι\r\nτῶν φιλτάτων ἀπολιμπάνοντες. ἐστρατεύσατο καὶ Περικλῆς ἐπὶ τὴν Σάμον οὐκ\r\nἄγων τὸν Ἀναξαγόραν, καὶ τὴν Εὔβοιαν παρεστήσατο ταῖς μὲν ἐκείνου βουλαῖς,\r\nἐπεπαίδευτο γὰρ ὑπ᾽ ἐκείνῳ, τὸ σῶμα δὲ οὐκ ἐφελκόμενος ὥσπερ ἄλλο [246] τι\r\nτῶν ἀναγκαίων πρὸς τὰς μάχας. καίτοι καὶ τοῦτον ἄκοντα, φασίν, Ἀθηναῖοι\r\nτῆς πρὸς τὸν διδάσκαλον ἀπέστησαν συνουσίας. ἀλλ᾽ ἔφερεν ὡς ἀνὴρ ἔμφρων\r\nὢν(322) τὴν ἄνοιαν τῶν αὑτοῦ πολιτῶν ἐγκρατῶς καὶ πρᾴως. καὶ γὰρ ἀνάγκῃ τῇ\r\nπατρίδι καθάπερ μητρὶ δικαίως μὲν οὔ, χαλεπῶς δὲ ὅμως ἐχούσῃ πρὸς τὴν\r\nσυνουσίαν αὐτῶν, εἴκειν ᾤετο χρῆναι, ταῦτα, ὡς εἰκός, λογιζόμενος· ἀκούειν\r\nδὲ χρὴ τῶν ἑξῆς ὡς τοῦ Περικλέους αὐτοῦ· Ἐμοὶ πόλις μέν ἐστι καὶ πατρὶς ὁ\r\nκόσμος, καὶ φίλοι θεοὶ καὶ δαίμονες καὶ πάντες [B] ὅσοι καὶ ὁπουοῦν(323)\r\nσπουδαῖοι. χρὴ δὲ καὶ τὴν οὗ(324) γεγόναμεν τιμᾶν, ἐπειδὴ τοῦτο θεῖός ἐστι\r\nνόμος, καὶ πείθεσθαί γε οἷς ἂν ἐπιτάττῃ καὶ μὴ βιάζεσθαι μηδέ, ὅ φησιν ἡ\r\nπαροιμία, πρὸς κέντρα λακτίζειν· ἀπαραίτητον γάρ ἐστι τὸ λεγόμενον ζυγὸν\r\nτῆς ἀνάγκης. οὐ μὴν ὀδυρτέον οὐδὲ θρηνητέον ἐφ᾽ οἷς ἐπιτάττει τραχύτερον,\r\nἀλλὰ τὸ πρᾶγμα λογιστέον αὐτό. νῦν ἀπαλλάττεσθαι τὸν Ἀναξαγόραν ἀφ᾽ ἡμῶν\r\nκελεύει, [C] καὶ τὸν ἄριστον οὐκ ὀψόμεθα τῶν ἑταίρων, δι᾽ ὃν ἠχθόμην μὲν\r\nτῇ νυκτί, ὅτι μοι τὸν φίλον οὐκ ἐδείκνυεν, ἡμέρᾳ δὲ καὶ ἡλίῳ χάριν\r\nἠπιστάμην, ὅτι μοι παρεῖχεν ὁρᾶν οὗ μάλιστα ἤρων. ἀλλ᾽ εἰ μὲν ὄμματά σοι\r\nδέδωκεν ἡ φύσις, ὦ Περίκλεις, μόνον ὥσπερ τοῖς θηρίοις(325), οὐδὲν ἀπεικός\r\nἐστι σε διαφερόντως ἄχθεσθαι· [D] εἰ δέ σοι ψυχὴν ἐνέπνευσε καὶ νοῦν\r\nἐνῆκεν, ὑφ᾽ οὗ τὰ μὲν πολλὰ τῶν γεγενημένων καίπερ οὐ παρόντα νῦν ὁρᾷς διὰ\r\nτῆς μνήμης, πολλὰ δὲ καὶ τῶν ἐσομένων ὁ λογισμὸς ἀνευρίσκων ὥσπερ ὄμμασιν\r\nὁρᾶν προσβάλλει τῷ νῷ, καὶ τῶν ἐνεστώτων οὐ τὰ πρὸ τῶν ὀμμάτων ἡ φαντασία\r\nμόνον ἀποτυπουμένη δίδωσιν αὐτῷ κρίνειν καὶ καθορᾶν, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὰ πόρρω καὶ\r\nμυριάσι σταδίων ἀπῳκισμένα τῶν γενομένων παρὰ πόδα [247] καὶ πρὸ τῶν\r\nὀφθαλμῶν δείκνυσιν ἐναργέστερον, τί χρὴ τοσοῦτον ἀνιᾶσθαι καὶ σχετλίως\r\nφέρειν; ὅτι δὲ οὐκ ἀμάρτυρος ὁ λόγος ἐστί μοι,\r\n\r\n(Let me go back now to Africanus and Laelius. When Carthage had been\r\ndestroyed(326) and all Libya made subject to Rome, Africanus sent Laelius\r\nhome and he embarked to carry the good news to their fatherland. And\r\nScipio was grieved at the separation from his friend, but he did not think\r\nhis sorrow inconsolable. Laelius too was probably afflicted at having to\r\nembark alone, but he did not regard it as an insupportable calamity. Cato\r\nalso made a voyage and left his intimate friends at home, and so did\r\nPythagoras and Plato and Democritus, and they took with them no companion\r\non their travels, though they left behind them at home many whom they\r\ndearly loved. Pericles also set out on his campaign against Samos without\r\ntaking Anaxagoras, and he conquered Euboea by following the latter’s\r\nadvice, for he had been trained by his teaching: but the philosopher\r\nhimself he did not drag in his train as though he were part of the\r\nequipment needed for battle. And yet in his case too we are told that much\r\nagainst his will the Athenians separated him from the society of his\r\nteacher. But wise man that he was, he bore the folly of his fellow‐\r\ncitizens with fortitude and mildness. Indeed he thought that he must of\r\nnecessity bow to his country’s will when, as a mother might, however\r\nunjustly, she still resented their close friendship; and he probably\r\nreasoned as follows. (You must take what I say next as the very words of\r\nPericles.(327)) “The whole world is my city and fatherland, and my friends\r\nare the gods and lesser divinities and all good men whoever and wherever\r\nthey may be. Yet it is right to respect also the country where I was born,\r\nsince this is the divine law, and to obey all her commands and not oppose\r\nthem, or as the proverb says kick against the pricks. For inexorable, as\r\nthe saying goes, is the yoke of necessity. But we must not even complain\r\nor lament when her commands are harsher than usual, but rather consider\r\nthe matter as it actually is. She now orders Anaxagoras to leave me and I\r\nshall see no more my best friend, on whose account the night was hateful\r\nto me because it did not allow me to see my friend, but I was grateful to\r\ndaylight and the sun because they allowed me to see him whom I loved\r\nbest.(328) But, Pericles, if nature had given you eyes only as she has to\r\nwild beasts, it would be natural enough for you to feel excessive grief.\r\nBut since she has breathed into you a soul, and implanted in you\r\nintelligence by means of which you now behold in memory many past events,\r\nthough they are no longer before you: and further since your reasoning\r\npower discovers many future events and reveals them as it were to the eyes\r\nof your mind; and again your imagination sketches for you not only those\r\npresent events which are going on under your eyes and allows you to judge\r\nand survey them, but also reveals to you things at a distance and many\r\nthousand stades(329) removed more clearly than what is going on at your\r\nfeet and before your eyes, what need is there for such grief and\r\nresentment?

And\r\nmoreover, though plants if removed from their native soil when the weather\r\nand the season are unfavourable cannot be kept alive, it is not so with\r\nmen, who can remove from one place to another without completely\r\ndeteriorating or changing their character and deviating from the right\r\nprinciples that they had before adopted. It is therefore unlikely that our\r\naffection will become blunted, if indeed we do not love and cherish each\r\nother the more for the separation. For ‘wantonness attends on\r\nsatiety,’(334) but love and longing on want. So in this respect we shall\r\nbe better off if our affection tends to increase, and we shall keep one\r\nanother firmly set in our minds like holy images. And one moment I shall\r\nsee Anaxagoras, and the next he will see me. Though nothing prevents our\r\nseeing one another at the same instant; I do not mean our flesh and sinews\r\nand ‘bodily outline and breasts in the likeness’(335) of the bodily\r\noriginal—though perhaps there is no reason why these too should not become\r\nvisible to our minds—but I mean our virtue, our deeds and words, our\r\nintercourse, and those conversations which we so often held with one\r\nanother, when in perfect harmony we sang the praises of education and\r\njustice and mind that governs all things mortal and human: when too we\r\ndiscussed the art of government, and law, and the different ways of being\r\nvirtuous and the noblest pursuits, everything in short that occurred to us\r\nwhen, as occasion served, we mentioned these subjects. If we reflect on\r\nthese things and nourish ourselves with these images, we shall probably\r\npay no heed to the ‘visions of dreams in the night,’(336) nor will the\r\nsenses corrupted by the alloy of the body exhibit to our minds empty and\r\nvain phantoms. For we shall not employ the senses at all to assist and\r\nminister to us, but our minds will have escaped from them and so will be\r\nexercised on the themes I have mentioned and aroused to comprehend and\r\nassociate with things incorporeal. For by the mind we commune even with\r\nGod, and by its aid we are enabled to see and to grasp things that escape\r\nthe senses and are far apart in space, or rather have no need of space:\r\nthat is to say, all of us who have lived so as to deserve such a vision,\r\nconceiving it in the mind and laying hold thereof.”)\r\n\r\nἈλλ᾽ ὁ μὲν Περικλῆς, ἅτε δὴ μεγαλόφρων ἀνὴρ [C] καὶ τραφεὶς ἐλευθέρως ἐν\r\nἐλευθέρᾳ τῇ πόλει, ὑψηλοτέροις ἐψυχαγώγει λόγοις αὑτόν· ἐγὼ δὲ γεγονὼς ἐκ\r\nτῶν οἷοι νῦν βροτοί εἰσιν ἀνθρωπικωτέροις ἐμαυτὸν θέλγω καὶ παράγω λόγοις,\r\nκαὶ τὸ λίαν πικρὸν ἀφαιρῶ τῆς λύπης, πρὸς ἕκαστον τῶν ἀεί μοι\r\nπροσπιπτόντων ἀπὸ τοῦ πράγματος δυσχερῶν τε [D] καὶ ἀτόπων φαντασμάτων\r\nἐφαρμόζειν τινὰ παραμυθίαν πειρώμενος, ὥσπερ ἐπῳδὴν θηρίου δήγματι\r\nδάκνοντος αὐτὴν ἔσω τὴν καρδίαν ἡμῶν καὶ τὰς φρένας. ἐκεῖνό τοι πρῶτόν\r\nἐστί μοι τῶν φαινομένων δυσχερῶν. νῦν ἐγὼ μόνος ἀπολελείψομαι καθαρᾶς\r\nἐνδεὴς ὁμιλίας καὶ ἐλευθέρας ἐντεύξεως· οὐ γὰρ ἔστι μοι τέως ὅτῳ\r\nδιαλέξομαι θαρρῶν ὁμοίως. πότερον οὖν οὐδ᾽ ἐμαυτῷ διαλέγεσθαι ῥᾴδιόν ἐστί\r\nμοι; ἀλλ᾽ ἀφαιρήσεταί μέ τις καὶ τὴν ἔννοιαν καὶ προσαναγκάσει νοεῖν ἕτερα\r\nκαὶ θαυμάζειν παρ᾽ ἃ βούλομαι; ἢ τοῦτο μέν ἐστι τέρας ἤδη καὶ προσόμοιον\r\nτῷ γράφειν ἐφ᾽ ὕδατος καὶ τῷ λίθον ἕψειν καὶ τῷ ἱπταμένων ὀρνίθων ἐρευνᾶν\r\nἴχνη τῆς πτήσεως; οὐκοῦν ἐπειδὴ [249] τούτων ἡμᾶς οὐδεὶς ἀφαιρεῖται,\r\nσυνεσόμεθα δήπουθεν αὐτοί πως ἑαυτοῖς, ἴσως δὲ καὶ ὁ δαίμων ὑποθήσεταί τι\r\nχρηστόν· οὐ γὰρ εἰκὸς ἄνδρα ἑαυτὸν ἐπιτρέψαντα τῷ κρείττονι παντάπασιν\r\nἀμεληθῆναι καὶ καταλειφθῆναι παντελῶς ἔρημον· ἀλλ᾽ αὐτοῦ καὶ ὁ θεὸς χεῖρα\r\nἑὴν ὑπερέσχε [B] καὶ θάρσος ἐνδίδωσ(337) καὶ μένος ἐμπνεῖ καὶ τὰ πρακτέα\r\nτίθησιν ἐπὶ νοῦν καὶ τῶν μὴ πρακτέων ἀφίστησιν. εἵπετό τοι καὶ Σωκράτει\r\nδαιμονία φωνὴ κωλύουσα πράττειν ὅσα μὴ χρεὼν ἦν· φησὶ δὲ καὶ Ὅμηρος ὑπὲρ\r\nἈχιλλέως· τῷ γὰρ ἐπὶ φρεσὶ θῆκεν, ὡς τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ τὰς ἐννοίας ἡμῶν\r\nἐγείροντος, ὅταν ἐπιστρέψας ὁ νοῦς εἰς ἑαυτὸν αὑτῷ τε πρότερον ξυγγένηται\r\nκαὶ τῷ θεῷ δι ἑαυτοῦ μόνου, [C] κωλυδόομενος ὑπ᾽ οὐδενοός. οὐ γὰρ ἀκοῆς ὁ\r\nνοῦς δεῖται πρὸς τὸ μαθεῖν οὐδὲ μὴν ὁ θεὸς φωνῆς πρὸς τὸ διδάξαι τὰ\r\nδέοντα· ἀλλ᾽ αἰσθήσεως ἔξω πάσης ἀπὸ τοῦ κρείττονος ἡ μετουσία γίνεται τῷ\r\nνῷ· τίνα μὲν τρόπον καὶ ὅπως οὐ σχολὴ νῦν ἐπεξιέναι, τὸ δ᾽ ὅτι γίνεται\r\nδῆλον(338) καὶ σαφεῖς οἱ μάρτυρες, οὐκ ἄδοξοί τινες οὐδ᾽ ἐν τῇ Μεγαρέως\r\n[D] ἄξιοι τάττεσθαι μερίδι, ἀλλὰ τῶν ἀπενεγκαμένων ἐπὶ σοφία τὰ\r\nπρωτεῖα.(339)\r\n\r\n(Ah, but Pericles, inasmuch as he was a man of lofty soul and was bred as\r\nbecame a free man in a free city, could solace himself with such sublime\r\narguments, whereas I, born of such men as now are,(340) must beguile and\r\nconsole myself with arguments more human; and thus I assuage the excessive\r\nbitterness of my sorrow, since I constantly endeavour to devise some\r\ncomfort for the anxious and uneasy ideas which keep assailing me as they\r\narise from this event, like a charm against some wild beast that is\r\ngnawing into my very vitals(341) and my soul. And first and foremost of\r\nthe hardships that I shall have to face is this, that now I shall be\r\nbereft of our guileless intercourse and unreserved conversation. For I\r\nhave no one now to whom I can talk with anything like the same confidence.\r\nWhat, you say, cannot I easily converse with myself? Nay, will not some\r\none rob me even of my thoughts, and besides compel me to think\r\ndifferently, and to admire what I prefer not to admire? Or does this\r\nrobbery amount to a prodigy unimaginable, like writing on water or boiling\r\na stone,(342) or tracing the track of the flight of birds on the wing?\r\nWell then since no one can deprive us of our thoughts, we shall surely\r\ncommune with ourselves in some fashion, and perhaps God will suggest some\r\nalleviation. For it is not likely that he who entrusts himself to God will\r\nbe utterly neglected and left wholly desolate. But over him God stretches\r\nhis hand,(343) endues him with strength, inspires him with courage, and\r\nputs into his mind what he must do. We know too how a divine voice\r\naccompanied Socrates and prevented him from doing what he ought not. And\r\nHomer also says of Achilles, “She put the thought in his mind,”(344)\r\nimplying that it is God who suggests our thoughts when the mind turns\r\ninwards and first communes with itself, and then with God alone by itself,\r\nhindered by nothing external. For the mind needs no ears to learn with,\r\nstill less does God need a voice to teach us our duty: but apart from all\r\nsense‐perception, communion with God is vouchsafed to the mind. How and in\r\nwhat manner I have not now leisure to inquire, but that this does happen\r\nis evident, and there are sure witnesses thereof—men not obscure or only\r\nfit to be classed with the Megarians,(345)—but such as have borne the palm\r\nfor wisdom.)\r\n\r\nΟὐκοῦν ἐπειδὴ χρὴ προσδοκᾶν καὶ θεὸν ἡμῖν παρέσεσθαι πάντως καὶ ἡμᾶς\r\nαὐτοὺς αὑτοῖς συνέσεσθαι, τὸ λίαν δυσχερὲς ἀφαιρετέον ἐστι τῆς λύπης. ἐπεὶ\r\nκαὶ τὸν Ὀδυσσέα μόνον ἐν τῇ νήσῳ καθειργμένον ἑπτὰ τοὺς πάντας ἐνιαυτούς,\r\nεἶτ᾽ ὀδυρόμενον, τῆς μὲν ἄλλης ἐπαινῶ καρτερίας, τῶν θρήνων δὲ οὐκ ἄγαμαι.\r\n[250] τί γὰρ ὄφελος πόντον ἐπ᾽ ἰχθυόεντα δέρκεσθαι καὶ λείβειν δάκρυα; τὸ\r\nδὲ μὴ προέσθαι μηδ᾽ ἀπαγορεῦσαι πρὸς τὴν τύχην, ἀλλ᾽ ἄνδρα μέχρις ἐσχάτων\r\nγενέσθαι πόνων(346) καὶ κινδύνων, τοῦτο ἔμοιγε φαίνεται μεῖζον ἢ κατὰ\r\nἄνθρωπον. οὐ δὴ δίκαιον ἐπαινεῖν μὲν αὐτούς, μὴ μιμεῖσθαι δέ, οὐδὲ\r\nνομίζειν, ὡς ἐκείνοις μὲν ὁ θεὸς προθύμως συνελάμβανε, [B] τοὺς δὲ νῦν\r\nπεριόψεται τῆς ἀρετῆς ὁρῶν ἀντιποιουμένους, δι᾽ ἥνπερ ἄρα κἀκείνοις\r\nἔχαιρεν· οὐ γὰρ διὰ τὸ κάλλος τοῦ σώματος, ἐπεί τοι τὸν Νιρέα μᾶλλον ἐχρῆν\r\nἀγαπᾶσθαι, οὐδὲ διὰ τὴν ἰσχύν, ἀπείρῳ γὰρ ὅσῳ Λαιστρυγόνες καὶ Κύκλωπες\r\nἦσαν αὐτοῦ κρείττους, οὐδὲ διὰ τὸν πλοῦτον, οὕτω γὰρ ἂν ἔμεινεν ἀπόρθητος\r\nΤροία. τί δὲ δεῖ πράγματα ἔχειν αὐτὸν ἐπιζητοῦντα τὴν αἰτίαν, δι ἣν\r\nὈδυσσέα φησὶν [C] ὁ ποιητὴς θεοφιλῆ, αὐτοῦ γε ἐξὸν ἀκούειν;\r\n\r\n(It follows therefore that since we may expect that God will be present\r\nwith us in all our doings, and that we shall again renew our intercourse,\r\nour grief must lose its sharpest sting. For indeed in the case of\r\nOdysseus(347) too, who was imprisoned on the island for all those seven\r\nyears and then bewailed his lot, I applaud him for his fortitude on other\r\noccasions, but I do not approve those lamentations. For of what avail was\r\nit for him to gaze on the fishy sea and shed tears?(348) Never to abandon\r\nhope and despair of one’s fate, but to play the hero in the extremes of\r\ntoil and danger, does indeed seem to me more than can be expected of any\r\nhuman being. But it is not right to praise and not to imitate the Homeric\r\nheroes, or to think that whereas God was ever ready to assist them he will\r\ndisregard the men of our day, if he sees that they are striving to attain\r\nthat very virtue for which he favoured those others. For it was not\r\nphysical beauty that he favoured, since in that case Nireus(349) would\r\nhave been more approved; nor strength, for the Laëstrygons(350) and the\r\nCyclops were infinitely stronger than Odysseus; nor riches, for had that\r\nbeen so Troy would never have been sacked. But why should I myself labour\r\nto discover the reason why the poet says that Odysseus was beloved by the\r\ngods, when we can hear it from himself?

Even Alexander, we are told, felt a\r\nneed for Homer, not, of course, to be his companion, but to be his herald,\r\nas he was for Achilles and Patroclus and the two Ajaxes and Antilochus.\r\nBut Alexander, ever despising what he had and longing for what he had not,\r\ncould never be content with his contemporaries or be satisfied with the\r\ngifts that had been granted to him. And even if Homer had fallen to his\r\nlot he would probably have coveted the lyre of Apollo on which the god\r\nplayed at the nuptials of Peleus;(353) and he would not have regarded it\r\nas an invention of Homer’s genius but an actual fact that had been woven\r\ninto the epic, as when for instance Homer says,)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ἠὼς μὲν κροκόπεπλος ἐκίδνατο πᾶσαν ἐπ᾽ αἶαν\r\n\r\n    (“Now Dawn with her saffron robe was spread over the whole\r\n    earth”;(354))\r\n\r\n\r\nκαὶ\r\n\r\n(and)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ἡέλιος δ᾽ ἀνόρουσε\r\n\r\n    (“Then uprose the Sun”;(355))\r\n\r\n\r\nκαὶ\r\n\r\n(and)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Κρήτη τις γαῖ᾽ ἐστί,\r\n\r\n    (“There is a land called Crete”;(356))\r\n\r\n\r\nκαὶ ὅσα τοιαῦτά φασιν οἱ ποιηταί, δῆλα καὶ ἐναργῆ τὰ μὲν ὄντα καὶ εἰς ἡμᾶς\r\nἕτι, τὰ δὲ γιγνόμενα.\r\n\r\n(or other similar statements of poets about plain and palpable things\r\npartly existing to this very day, partly still happening.)\r\n\r\n[B] Ἀλλὰ τῷ μὲν εἴτε μέγεθος ἀρετῆς ὑπερέχον(357) καὶ τῶν προσόντων ἀγαθῶν\r\nοὐδαμῶς ἐλάττων σύνεσις εἰς τοσαύτην ἐπιθυμίαν τὴν ψυχὴν ἐξῆγεν, ὥστε\r\nμειζόνων ἢ κατὰ τοὺς ἄλλους ὀρέγεσθαι,(358) εἴθ᾽ ὑπερβολή τις ἀνδρείας καὶ\r\nθάρσους εἰς ἀλαζονείαν ἄγουσα(359) καὶ πρὸς αὐθάδειαν βλέπουσα, ἀφείσθω\r\nσκοπεῖν ἐν κοινῷ τοῖς βουλομένοις ἐπαινεῖν ἢ ψέγειν αὐτόν, [C] εἴ τις ἄρα\r\nκαὶ ταύτης ὑπολαμβάνει τῆς μερίδος προσήκειν ἐκείνῳ. ἡμεῖς δὲ τοῖς\r\nπαροῦσιν ἀγαπῶντες ἀεὶ καὶ τῶν ἀπόντων ἥκιστα μεταποιούμενοι στέργομεν\r\nμέν, ὁπόταν ὁ κήρυξ ἐπαινῇ, θεατής τε καὶ συναγωνιστὴς πάντων ἡμῖν\r\nγεγονώς, μὴ τοὺς λόγους παραδεξάμενος εἰς χάριν καὶ ἀπέχθειαν εἰκῇ\r\nπεπλασμένους· ἀρκεῖ δὲ ἡμῖν καὶ φιλεῖν ὁμολογῶν μόνον, ἐς δὲ τὰ ἄλλα\r\nσιωπηλότερος ὢν καὶ τῶν Πυθαγόρᾳ τελεσθέντων.\r\n\r\n(But in Alexander’s case, whether a superabundance of virtue and an\r\nintelligence that matched the advantages with which he was endowed exalted\r\nhis soul to such heights of ambition that he aimed at greater achievements\r\nthan are within the scope of other men; or whether the cause was an excess\r\nof courage and valour that led him into ostentation and bordered on sinful\r\npride, must be left as a general topic for consideration by those who\r\ndesire to write either a panegyric of him or a criticism; if indeed anyone\r\nthinks that criticism also can properly be applied to him. I on the\r\ncontrary can always be content with what I have and am the last to covet\r\nwhat I have not, and so am well content when my praises are uttered by a\r\nherald who has been an eyewitness and comrade‐in‐arms in all that I have\r\ndone; and who has never admitted any statements invented at random out of\r\npartiality or prejudice.

But as for you—for I must needs dismiss you\r\nwith auspicious words—may God in His goodness be your guide wherever you\r\nmay have to journey, and as the God of Strangers and the Friendly One(362)\r\nmay He receive you graciously and lead you safely by land; and if you must\r\ngo by sea, may He smooth the waves!(363) And may you be loved and honoured\r\nby all you meet, welcome when you arrive, regretted when you leave them!\r\nThough you retain your affection for me, may you never lack the society of\r\na good comrade and faithful friend!

Technically\r\nhe was a Sophist: that is to say he gave public lectures (ἐπιδείξεις),\r\nwrote exercises after the Sophistic pattern and went on embassies, which\r\nwere entrusted to him solely on account of his persuasive charm. But he\r\ninsisted that he was no Sophist, because he took no fees(365) and styled\r\nhimself a practical philosopher.(366) He was indifferent to the Neo‐\r\nPlatonic philosophy,(367) and, since Constantius made him a Senator, he\r\ncannot have betrayed any zeal for the Pagan religion. From Julian’s Pagan\r\nrestoration he seems to have held aloof, and, though Julian had been his\r\npupil, probably at Nicomedia, he did not appoint him to any office. Under\r\nthe Christian Emperor Theodosius he held a prefecture. There is no\r\nevidence for a positive coolness, such as Zeller(368) assumes, between\r\nThemistius and Julian, and we know too little of their relations to assert\r\nwith some critics that the respectful tone of this letter is\r\nironical.(369) It was probably written after Julian had become Emperor,\r\nthough there is nothing in it that would not suit an earlier date; it is\r\nsometimes assigned to 355 when Julian was still Caesar. The quotations\r\nfrom Aristotle are appropriately addressed to Themistius as an\r\nAristotelian commentator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[253] ΙΟΥΛΙΑΝΟΥ ΑΥΤΟΚΡΑΤΟΡΟΣ\r\n\r\n(Julian, Emperor)\r\n\r\nΘΕΜΙΣΤΙΩΙ ΦΙΛΟΣΟΦΩΙ\r\n\r\n(To Themistius the Philosopher)\r\n\r\nἘγώ σοι βεβαιῶσαι μέν, ὥσπερ οὖν γράφεις, τὰς ἐλπίδας καὶ σφόδρα εὔχομαι,\r\nδέδοικα δὲ μὴ διαμάρτω, μείζονος οὔσης τῆς ὑποσχέσεως, ἣν ὑπὲρ ἐμοῦ πρός\r\nτε τοὺς ἄλλους ἅπαντας καὶ ἔτι μᾶλλον πρὸς σεαυτὸν ποιῇ· καί μοι πάλαι μὲν\r\nοἰομένῳ πρός τε τὸν Ἀλέξανδρον καὶ τὸν Μάρκον, καὶ εἴ τις ἄλλος γέγονεν\r\nἀρετῇ διαφέρων, [B] εἶναι τὴν ἅμιλλαν φρίκη τις προσῄει καὶ δέος\r\nθαυμαστόν, μὴ τοῦ μὲν ἀπολείπεσθαι παντελῶς τῆς ἀνδρείας δόξω, τοῦ δὲ τῆς\r\nτελείας ἀρετῆς οὐδὲ ἐπ᾽ ὀλίγον ἐφίκωμαι. εἰς ταῦτα ἀφορῶν ἀνεπειθόμην τὴν\r\nσχολὴν ἐπαινεῖν, καὶ τῶν Ἀττικῶν διαιτημάτων(370) αὐτός τε ἡδέως ἐμεμνήμην\r\nκαὶ τοῖς φίλοις ὑμῖν προσᾴδειν ἠξίουν, ὥσπερ οἱ τὰ βαρέα φορτία φέροντες\r\nἐν ταῖς ᾠδαῖς ἐπικουφίζουσιν αὑτοῖς τὴν ταλαιπωρίαν.

There was a time when I believed that I\r\nought to try to rival men who have been most distinguished for excellence,\r\nAlexander, for instance, or Marcus;(371) but I shivered at the thought and\r\nwas seized with terror lest I should fail entirely to come up to the\r\ncourage of the former, and should not make even the least approach to the\r\nlatter’s perfect virtue. With this in mind I convinced myself that I\r\npreferred a life of leisure, and I both gladly recalled the Attic manner\r\nof living, and thought myself to be in sweet accord with you who are my\r\nfriends, just as those who carry heavy burdens lighten their labour by\r\nsinging.(372) But by your recent letter you have increased my fears, and\r\nyou point to an enterprise in every way more difficult. You say that God\r\nhas placed me in the same position as Heracles and Dionysus of old who,\r\nbeing at once philosophers and kings, purged almost the whole earth and\r\nsea of the evils that infested them. You bid me shake off all thought of\r\nleisure and inactivity that I may prove to be a good soldier worthy of so\r\nhigh a destiny. And besides those examples you go on to remind me of law‐\r\ngivers such as Solon, Pittacus, and Lycurgus, and you say that men have\r\nthe right to expect from me now greater things than from any of these.\r\nWhen I read these words I was almost dumbfounded; for on the one hand I\r\nwas sure that it was unlawful for you as a philosopher to flatter or\r\ndeceive; on the other hand I am fully conscious that by nature there is\r\nnothing remarkable about me—there never was from the first nor has there\r\ncome to be now,—but as regards philosophy I have only fallen in love with\r\nit (I say nothing of the fates that have intervened(373) to make that love\r\nso far ineffectual). I could not tell therefore how I ought to interpret\r\nsuch expressions, until God brought it into my mind that perhaps by your\r\nvery praises you wished to exhort me, and to point out how great are those\r\ntrials to which a statesman must inevitably be exposed every day of his\r\nlife.)\r\n\r\nΤοῦτο δὲ ἀποτρέποντός ἐστι πλέον ἢ πρὸς τὸν βίον παρορμῶντος. ὥσπερ γὰρ εἴ\r\nτις τὸν πορθμὸν τὸν παρ᾽ ὑμῖν πλέων καὶ οὐδὲ τοῦτον ῥᾳδίως οὐδὲ εὐκόλως\r\nὑφιστάμενος ἀκούοι παρά του μαντικὴν ἐπαγγελλομένου τέχνην, [D] ὡς χρεὼν\r\nαὐτὸν τὸν Αἰγαῖον ἀναμετρῆσαι καὶ τὸν Ἰόνιον καὶ τῆς ἔξω θαλάσσης ἅψασθαι,\r\nκαὶ “Νῦν μὲν” ὁρᾷς ὁ προφήτης λέγοι “τείχη καὶ λιμένας, ἐκεῖ δὲ γενόμενος\r\nοὐδὲ σκοπιὰν οὐδὲ πέτραν ὄψει, ἀλλ᾽ ἀγαπήσεις καὶ ναῦν πόρρωθεν κατιδὼν\r\nπροσειπεῖν τοὺς ἐμπλέοντας, καὶ τῆς γῆς ὀψέ ποτε ἁψάμενος, τῷ θεῷ πολλάκις\r\nπροσεύξῃ, πρὸς αὐτῷ γοῦν τῷ τέλει τοῦ βίου τυχεῖν [255] ὅρμου καὶ τήν τε\r\nναῦν σώαν παραδοῦναι καὶ τοὺς ἐμπλέοντας ἀπαθεῖς τοῖς οἰκείοις κακῶν\r\nπαραστῆσαι καὶ τὸ σῶμα τῇ μητρὶ γῇ δοῦναι, τοῦτο δὲ ἐσόμενον ἴσως ἄδηλον\r\nἔσται σοι μέχρι τῆς τελευταίας ἐκείνης ἡμέρας·” ἆρ᾽ οἴει τούτων ἀκούσαντα\r\nτῶν λόγων ἐκεῖνον πόλιν γ᾽ ἂν(374) οἰκεῖν ἑλέσθαι πλησίον θαλάσσης, οὐχὶ\r\nδὲ χαίρειν εἰπόντα πλούτῳ καὶ τοῖς ἐξ ἐμπορίας ἀγαθοῖς περιγιγνομένοις,\r\nγνωρέμων πολλῶν, ξενικῆς φιλίας, [B] ἱστορίας ἐθνῶν καὶ πόλεων ὑπεριδόντα\r\nσοφὸν ἀποφαίνειν τὸν τοῦ Νεοκλέους, ὃς κελεύει λαθεῖν βιώσαντα; καὶ σὺ δὲ\r\nἕοικας τοῦτο καταμαθὼν προκαταλαμβάνειν ἡμᾶς ταῖς εἰς τὸν Ἐπίκουρον\r\nλοιδορίαις καὶ προεξαιρεῖν τὴν τοιαύτην γνώμην. φὴς γάρ που σχολὴν\r\nἐπαινεῖν ἀπράγμονα καὶ διαλέξεις ἐν περιπάτοις προσήκειν ἐκείνῳ· [C] ἐγὲ\r\nδὲ ὅτι μὲν οὐ καλῶς Ἐπικούρῳ ταῦτα ἐδόκει, πάλαι καὶ σφόδρα πείθομαι· εἰ\r\nδὲ πάνθ᾽ ὁντινοῦν ἐπὶ πολιτείαν προτρέπειν ἄξιον, καὶ τὸν ἧττον πεφυκότα\r\nκαὶ τὸν οὔπω τελέως δυνάμενον, ἐπὶ πλεῖστον ἴσως διαπορῆσαι χρή. λέγουσι\r\nγάρ τοι καὶ τὸν Σωκράτη πολλοὺς μὲν οὐ σφόδρα εὐφυῶς(375) ἔχοντας\r\nἀπαγαγεῖν τοῦ βήματος, καὶ Γλαύκωνα ἐκεῖνον, Ξενοφῶν λέγει· τὸν δὲ(376)\r\nτοῦ Κλεινίου παῖδα πειραθῆναι μὲν ἐπισχεῖν, [D] οὐ δυνηθῆναι δὲ\r\nπεριγενέσθαι τοῦ νεανίσκου τῆς ὁρμῆς. ἡμεῖς δὲ καὶ ἄκοντας καὶ ξυνιέντας\r\nαὑτῶν προσαναγκάσομεν, θαρρεῖν ὑπὲρ τηλικούτων ἔργων κελεύοντες, ὧν οὐκ\r\nἀρετὴ μόνον ἐστὶν οὐδὲ προαίρεσις ὀρθὴ κυρία, πολὺ δὲ πλέον ἡ τύχη\r\nκρατοῦσα πανταχοῦ καὶ βιαζομένη ῥέπειν ᾗπερ ἂν ἐθέλῃ τὰ πράγματα;\r\nΧρύσιππος δὲ δοκεῦ τὰ μὲν ἄλλα σοφὸς εἶναι καὶ νομισθῆναι δικαίως,\r\nἀγνοήσας δὲ τὴν τύχην καὶ τὸ αὐτόματον καί τινας ἄλλας αἰτίας [256]\r\nτοιαύτας ἔξωθεν τοῖς πρακτικοῖς παρεμπιπτούσας οὐ σφόδρα ὁμολογούμενα\r\nλέγειν οἷς ὁ χρόνος ἡμᾶς διὰ μυρίων ἐναργῶς διδάσκει παραδειγμάτων. ποῦ\r\nγὰρ εὐτυχῆ καὶ μακάριον Κάτωνα φήσομεν; ποῦ δὲ Δίωνα τὸν Σικελιώτην\r\nεὐδαίμονα; οἷς τοῦ μὲν ἀποθανεῖν ἔμελεν ἴσως οὐδέν, τοῦ δὲ μὴ λείπειν\r\nἀτελεῖς τὰς πράξεις, ἐφ᾽ ἃς ἐξ ἀρχῆς ὥρμησαν, [B] καὶ σφόδρα ἔμελε, καὶ\r\nπάντα ἂν εἵλοντο παθεῖν ὑπὲρ τούτου. σφαλέντες δὲ ἐν ἐκείνοις εἰ μὲν\r\nεὐσχημόνως ἔφερον, ὥσπερ οὖν λέγεται, τὴν τύχην παραμυθίαν ἔσχον ἐκ τῆς\r\nἀρετῆς οὐ μικράν, εὐδαίμονες δὲ οὐκ ἂν λέγοιντο τῶν καλλίστων πράξεων\r\nδιημαρτηκότες, πλὴν ἴσως διὰ τὴν Στωικὴν ἔνστασιν· πρὸς ἣν ῥητέον, ὡς οὐ\r\nταὐτόν ἐστιν ἐπαινεῖσθα καὶ μακαρίζεσθαι, καὶ εἰ φύσει τὸ ζῷον εὐδαιμονίας\r\nὀρέγεται, [C] κρεῖττον εἶναι τὸ κατ᾽ ἐκείνην μακαριστὸν τέλος τοῦ κατ᾽\r\nἀρετὴν ἐπαινετοῦ. ἥκιστα δὲ φιλεῖ τῆς εὐδαιμονίας ἡ βεβαιότης τῇ τύχῃ\r\nπιστεύειν. καὶ τοὺς ἐν πολιτείᾳ ζῶντας οὐκ ἔνεστιν ἔνευ ταύτης ἀναπνεῖν τὸ\r\nδὴ λεγόμενον ...(377) ἀληθῶς θεωροῦντες εἴτε καὶ πεποιήκασι καὶ στρατηγὸν\r\nλόγῳ(378), καθάπερ οἱ τὰς ἰδέας εἴτε καὶ ψευδῶς ξυντιθέντες, ἐν τοῖς\r\nἀσωμάτοις καὶ νοητοῖς ἱδρῦσθαί που τῶν τυχαίων ὑπεράνω πάντων, ἢ τὸν\r\nΔιογένους ἐκεῖνον\r\n\r\n(But your method is more likely to discourage than to make one eager for\r\nsuch an existence. Suppose that a man were navigating your strait,(379)\r\nand were finding even that none too easy or safe, and then suppose some\r\nprofessional soothsayer should tell him that he would have to traverse the\r\nAegaean and then the Ionian Sea, and finally embark on the outer sea.\r\n“Here,” that prophet would say, “you see towns and harbours, but when you\r\narrive there you will see not so much as a watch‐tower or a rock, but you\r\nwill be thankful to descry even a ship in the distance and to hail her\r\ncrew. You will often pray to God that you may, however late, touch land\r\nand reach a harbour, though that were to be the last day of your life. You\r\nwill pray to be allowed to bring home your ship safe and sound and restore\r\nyour crew unscathed to their friends, and then to commit your body to\r\nmother earth. And this indeed may happen, but you will not be sure of it\r\nuntil that final day.” Do you think that such a man after being told all\r\nthis would choose even to live in a sea‐port town? Would he not bid adieu\r\nto money‐making and all the advantages of commerce, and caring little for\r\ntroops of friends and acquaintances abroad, and all that he might learn\r\nabout nations and cities, would he not approve the wisdom of the son of\r\nNeocles(380) who bids us “Live in obscurity”? Indeed, you apparently\r\nperceived this, and by your abuse of Epicurus you tried to forestall me\r\nand to eradicate beforehand any such purpose. For you go on to say that it\r\nwas to be expected that so idle a man as he should commend leisure and\r\nconversations during walks. Now for my part I have long been firmly\r\nconvinced that Epicurus was mistaken in that view of his, but whether it\r\nbe proper to urge into public life any and every man, both him who lacks\r\nnatural abilities and him who is not yet completely equipped, is a point\r\nthat deserves the most careful consideration. We are told that Socrates\r\ndissuaded from the statesman’s profession(381) many who had no great\r\nnatural talent, and Glaucon too, Xenophon(382) tells us; and that he tried\r\nto restrain the son of Cleinias(383) also, but could not curb the youth’s\r\nimpetuous ambition. Then shall we try to force into that career men who\r\nare reluctant and conscious of their deficiencies, and urge them to be\r\nself‐confident about such great tasks? For in such matters not virtue\r\nalone or a wise policy is paramount, but to a far greater degree Fortune\r\nholds sway throughout and compels events to incline as she wills.\r\nChrysippus(384) indeed, though in other respects he seems a wise man and\r\nto have been rightly so esteemed, yet in ignoring fortune and chance and\r\nall other such external causes that fall in to block the path of men of\r\naffairs, he uttered paradoxes wholly at variance with facts about which\r\nthe past teaches us clearly by countless examples. For instance, shall we\r\ncall Cato a fortunate and happy man? Or shall we say that Dio of Sicily\r\nhad a happy lot? It is true that for death they probably cared nothing,\r\nbut they did care greatly about not leaving unfinished the undertakings\r\nwhich they had originally set on foot, and to secure that end there is\r\nnothing that they would not have endured. In that they were disappointed,\r\nand I admit that they bore their lot with great dignity, as we learn, and\r\nderived no small consolation from their virtue; but happy one could not\r\ncall them, seeing that they had failed in all those noble enterprises,\r\nunless perhaps according to the Stoic conception of happiness. And with\r\nregard to that same Stoic conception we must admit that to be applauded\r\nand to be counted happy are two very different things, and that if every\r\nliving thing naturally desires happiness,(385) it is better to make it our\r\naim to be congratulated on the score of happiness rather than to be\r\napplauded on the score of virtue. But happiness that depends on the\r\nchances of Fortune is very rarely secure. And yet men who are engaged in\r\npublic life cannot, as the saying is, so much as breathe unless she is on\r\ntheir side ... and they have created a merely verbal idea of a leader who\r\nis established somewhere above all the chances of Fortune in the sphere of\r\nthings incorporeal and intelligible, just as men define the ideas, whether\r\nenvisaging them truly or falsely imagining them. Or again they give us the\r\nideal man, according to Diogenes)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ἄπολιν, [D] ἄοικον, πατρίδος ἐστερημένον,\r\n\r\n    (“The man without a city, without a home, bereft of a\r\n    fatherland,”(386))\r\n\r\n\r\nοὐκ ἔχοντα μὲν εἰς ὅ,τι παρ᾽ αὐτῆς εὖ πάθῃ καὶ τοὐναντίον ἐν τίνι σφαλῇ·\r\nτοῦτον δὲ ὃν ἡ συνήθεια καλεῖν εἴωθε καὶ Ὅμηρος πρῶτος,\r\n\r\n(that is to say, a man who can gain nothing from Fortune, and on the other\r\nhand has nothing to lose. But one whom we are in the habit of calling, as\r\nHomer did first,)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ὧι λαοί τ᾽ ἐπιτετράφαται καὶ τόσσα μέμηλεν,\r\n\r\n    (“The man to whom the people have been entrusted and so many cares\r\n    belong,”(387))\r\n\r\n\r\nπῶς ἄν τις ἔξω τύχης ἀπαγαγὼν τὴν θέσιν φύλάσσοι; πάλιν [257] δ᾽ ὁ αὑτὸν\r\nὑποτιθεὶς ταύτῃ πόσης αὑτῷ δεῖν οἰήσεται παρασκευῆς(388) καὶ φρονήσεως\r\nπηλίκης ὥστε τὰς ἐφ᾽ ἑκάτερα ῥοπάς, καθάπερ πνεύματος κυβερνήτην,\r\nεὐσχημόνως φέρειν;\r\n\r\n(how I ask shall we lead him beyond the reach of Fortune and keep his\r\nposition secure? Then again, if he subject himself to Fortune, how great\r\nthe provision he will think he must make, how great the prudence he must\r\ndisplay so as to sustain with equanimity her variations in either\r\ndirection, as a pilot must sustain the variations of the wind!)\r\n\r\nΟὐκ ἔστι θαυμαστὸν ἀντιτάξασθαι προσπολεμούσῃ μόνον αὐτῇ, πολὺ δὲ\r\nθαυμασιώτερον(389) τῶν ὑπαρξάντων παρ᾽ αὐτῆς ἀγαθῶν ἄξιον φανῆναι. τούτοις\r\nὁ μέγιστος ἑάλω βασιλεὺς ὁ τὴν Ἀσίαν καταστρεψάμενος [B] Δαρείου καὶ\r\nΞέρξου χαλεπώτερος καὶ μᾶλλον ἀλαζὼν φανείς, ἐπειδὴ τῆς ἐκείνων ἀρχῆς\r\nκατέστη κύριος, τούτοις ἁλόντες τοῖς βέλεσιν ἄρδην ἀπώλοντο Πέρσαι,\r\nΜακεδόνες, ὁ τῶν Ἀθηναίων δῆμος, Συρακούσιοι, τὰ Λακεδαιμωνίων τέλη,\r\nῬωμαίων στρατηγοὶ καὶ ἐπ᾽ αὐτοῖς αὐτοκράτορες μυρίοι. πολὺ μῆκος ἂν\r\nγένοιτο πάντας ἀπαριθμουμένῳ τοὺς διὰ πλοῦτον καὶ νίκας καὶ τρυφὴν\r\nἀπολομένους· ὅσοι δὲ ὑπὸ τῶν δυσπραγιῶν ἐπικλυσθέντες δοῦλοι [C] μὲν ἀντ᾽\r\nἐλευθέρων, ταπεινοὶ δὲ ἀντὶ γενναίων καὶ σφόδρα εὐτελεῖς ἀντὶ τῶν πρόσθεν\r\nσεμνῶν ἅπασιν ὤφθησαν, τί με χρὴ νῦν ὥσπερ ἐκ δέλτου μεταγράφοντα\r\nκαταλέγειν; εἰ γὰρ ὤφελεν ὁ τῶν ἀνθρώπων βίος ἀπορεῖν παραδειγμάτων\r\nτοιούτων. ἀλλ᾽ οὔτε ἐστὶν οὔτ᾽ ἂν γένοιτό ποτε τῶν τοιούτων ἐνδεὴς\r\nπαραδειγμάτων, ἕως ἂν τὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων διαμένῃ γένος.\r\n\r\n(Yet it is nothing wonderful to withstand Fortune when she is merely\r\nhostile, but much more wonderful is it to show oneself worthy of the\r\nfavours she bestows. By her favours the greatest of kings, the\r\nconqueror(390) of Asia was ensnared, and showed himself more cruel and\r\nmore insolent than Darius and Xerxes, after he had become the master of\r\ntheir empire. The shafts of her favours subdued and utterly destroyed the\r\nPersians, the Macedonians, the Athenian nation, Spartan magistrates, Roman\r\ngenerals, and countless absolute monarchs besides. It would be an endless\r\nbusiness to enumerate all who have fallen victims to their wealth and\r\nvictories and luxury. And as for those who, submerged by the tide of their\r\nmisfortunes, from free men have become slaves, who have been humbled from\r\ntheir high estate after all their splendour and become poor and mean in\r\nthe eyes of all men, what need now to go through the list of them as\r\nthough I were copying it from a written record? Would that human life\r\nafforded no such instances! But it does not nor ever will lack such, so\r\nlong as the race of man endures.)\r\n\r\n[D] Ὅτι δὲ οὐκ ἐγὼ μόνος τὴν τύχην ἐπὶ πλεῖστον ἐν τοῖς πρακτέοις κρατεῖν\r\nνενόμικα, λέγοιμ᾽ ἂν ἤδη σοι τὰ τοῦ Πλάτωνος ἐκ τῶν θαυμασίων Νόμων,\r\nεἰδότι μὲν καὶ διδάξαντί με, ἀπόδειξιν δὲ ὥσπερ τοῦ μὴ ῥᾳθυμεῖν ποιούμενος\r\nπαραγέγραφά σοι τὴν ῥῆσιν ὧδέ πως ἔχουσαν. “Θεὸς μὲν πάντα καὶ μετὰ θεοῦ\r\nτύχη καὶ καιρὸς τὰ ἀνθρώπινα διακυβερνῶσι ξύμπαντα. ἡμερώτερον μὴν τούτοις\r\nσυγχωρῆσαι [258] τρίτον δεῖν ἕπεσθαι τέχνην.” εἶτα ὁποῖον εἶναι χρὴ τὸν\r\nτεχνίτην καὶ δημιουργὸν τῶν καλῶν πράξεων καὶ βασιλέα θεῖον(391)\r\nὑπογράφων· “Γινώσκων ὁ Κρόνος ἄρα, καθάπερ ἡμεῖς, φησί, διεληλύθαμεν, ὡς\r\nἀνθρωπεία φύσις οὐδαμῇ οὐδεμία ἱκανὴ τὰ ἀνθρώπινα διοικοῦσα αὐτοκράτωρ\r\nπάντα μὴ οὐχ ὕβρεώς τε καὶ ἀδικίας μεστοῦσθαι, [B] ταῦτ᾽ οὖν διανοούμενος\r\nἐφίστη τότε βασιλέας καὶ ἄρχοντας ταῖς πόλεσιν ἡμῶν οὐκ ἀνθρώπους, ἀλλὰ\r\nγένους θειοτέρου καὶ ἀμείνονος, δαίμονας, οἷον νῦν ἡμεῖς δρῶμεν τοῖς\r\nποιμνίοις καὶ ὅσων ἡμεροί εἰσιν ἀγέλαι· οὐ βοῦς βοῶν οὐδὲ αἶγας αἰγῶν\r\nἄρχοντας ποιοῦμεν αὐτοῖς τινας, ἀλλ᾽ ἡμεῖς αὐτῶν δεσπόζομεν, ἄμεινον\r\nἐκείνων γένος. ταὐτὸν δὴ καὶ ὁ θεὸς φιλάνθρωπος ὢν γένος ἄμεινον ἡμῶν\r\nἐφίστη τὸ τῶν δαιμόνων, ὃ διὰ πολλῆς μὲν αὐτοῖς ῥᾳστώνης, [C] διὰ πολλῆς\r\nδ᾽ ἡμῖν, ἐπιμελόμενον ἡμῶν, εἰρήνην τε καὶ αἰδῶ καὶ δὴ ἀφθονίαν δίκης\r\nπαρεχόμενον, ἀστασίαστα καὶ εὐδαίμονα τὰ τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἀπειργάζετο γένη.\r\nλέγει δὴ καὶ νῦν οὗτος ὁ λόγος ἀληθείᾳ χρώμενος, ὅσων πόλεων μὴ θεός, ἀλλά\r\nτις ἄρχει θνητός, οὐκ ἔστι κακῶν αὐτοῖς οὐδὲ πόνων ἀνάψυξις· ἀλλὰ\r\nμιμεῖσθαι δεῖν ἡμᾶς οἴεται πάσῃ μηχανῇ τὸν ἐπὶ τοῦ Κρόνου λεγόμενον βίον,\r\n[D] καὶ ὅσον ἐν ἡμῖν ἀθανασίας ἔνεστι, τούτῳ πειθομένους δημοσίᾳ καὶ ἰδίᾳ\r\nτάς τε οἰκήσεις καὶ τὰς πόλεις διοικεῖν, τὴν τοῦ νοῦ διανομὴν ὀνομάζοντας\r\nνόμον. εἰ δὲ ἄνθρωπος εἷς ἢ ὀλιγαρχία τις ἢ δημοκρατία ψυχὴν ἔχουσα ἡδονῶν\r\nκαὶ ἐπιθυμιῶν ὀρεγομένην καὶ πληροῦσθαι [259] τούτων δεομένην ἄρξει δὴ\r\nπόλεώς τινος ἢ ἰδιώτου καταπατήσας τοὺς νόμους, οὐκ ἔστι σωτηρίας μηχανή.”\r\n\r\n(And to show that I am not the only one who thinks that Fortune has the\r\nupper hand in practical affairs, I will quote to you a passage from that\r\nadmirable work the Laws of Plato. You know it well and indeed taught it to\r\nme, but I have set down the speech which runs something like this, and\r\noffer it as a proof that I am not really indolent. “God governs all things\r\nand with God Fortune and Opportunity govern all human affairs: but there\r\nis a milder view that Art must needs go with them and must be their\r\nassociate.”(392) He then indicates what must be the character of a man who\r\nis the craftsman and artificer of noble deeds and a divinely inspired\r\nking. Then he says: “Kronos therefore, as I have already related, knew\r\nthat human nature when endowed with supreme authority is never in any case\r\ncapable of managing human affairs without being filled with insolence and\r\ninjustice; therefore, having regard to this he at that time set over our\r\ncities as kings and governors not men but beings of a more divine and\r\nhigher race, I mean demons; thus doing as we do now for our flocks and\r\ndomestic herds. We never appoint certain oxen to rule over other oxen or\r\ngoats to rule over goats, but we are their masters, a race superior to\r\ntheirs. In like manner then God, since he loves mankind, has set over us a\r\nrace of beings superior to ourselves, the race of demons; and they with\r\ngreat ease both to themselves and us undertake the care of us and dispense\r\npeace, reverence, aye, and above all justice without stint, and thus they\r\nmake the tribes of men harmonious and happy. And that account is a true\r\none which declares that in our day all cities that are governed not by a\r\ngod but by a mortal man have no relief from evils and hardships. And the\r\nlesson is that we ought by every means in our power to imitate that life\r\nwhich is said to have existed in the days of Kronos: and in so far as the\r\nprinciple of immortality is in us we ought to be guided by it in our\r\nmanagement of public and private affairs, of our houses and cities,\r\ncalling the distribution of mind ‘law.’(393) But whether the government be\r\nin the hands of one man or of an oligarchy or democracy, if it have a soul\r\nthat hankers after pleasure and the lower appetites and demands to indulge\r\nthese, and if such a one rule over a city or individual having first\r\ntrampled on the laws, there is no means of salvation.”(394))\r\n\r\nΤαύτην ἐγώ σοι τὴν ῥῆσιν ἐξεπίτηδες ὅλην παρέγραφα, μή με κλέπτειν\r\nὑπολάβῃς καὶ κακουργεῖν μύθους ἀρχαίους προφέροντα, τυχὸν μὲν ἐμφερῶς, οὐ\r\nμὴν ἀληθῶς πάντη ξυγκειμένους. ἀλλ᾽ ὅ γε ἀληθὴς ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν λόγος τί φησιν;\r\nἀκούεις ὅτι, κἂν ἄνθρωπός τις ᾖ τῇ φύσει, θεῖον εἶναι χρὴ τῇ προαιρέσει\r\nκαὶ δαίμονα, πᾶν ἅπλως ἐκβαλόντα τὸ θνητὸν καὶ θηριῶδες τῆς ψυχῆς, [B]\r\nπλὴν ὅσα ἀνάγκη διὰ τὴν τοῦ σώματος παραμένειν σωτηρίαν; ταῦτα εἴ τις\r\nἐννοῶν δέδοικεν ἐπὶ τηλικοῦτον ελκόμενος βίον, ἆρά σοι φαίνεται τὴν\r\nἘπικούρειον θαυμάζειν ἀπραγμοσύνην καὶ τοὺς κήπους καὶ τὸ προάστειον τῶν\r\nἈθηνῶν(395) καὶ τὰς μυρρίνας καὶ τὸ Σωκράτους δωμάτιον; ἀλλ᾽ οὐκ ἔστιν\r\nὅπου γε ἐγὼ ταῦτα προτιμήσας τῶν πόνων ὤφθην. ἥδιστα ἄν σοι τοὺς ἐμαυτοῦ\r\nπόνους διεξῆλθον καὶ τὰ ἐπικρεμασθέντα παρὰ τῶν φίλων καὶ ξυγγενῶν, ὅτε\r\nτῆς παρ᾽ ὑμῖν [C] ἠρχόμην παιδείας, δείματα, εἰ μὴ σφόδρα αὐτὸς ἠπίστασο.\r\nτὰ δὲ ἐν Ἰωνίᾳ πρὸς τὸν καὶ γένει προσήκοντα καὶ φιλίᾳ μᾶλλον οἰκεῖον ὄντα\r\nμοι πραχθέντα πρότερον ὑπὲρ ἀνδρὸς ξένου μικρά παντελῶς γνωρίμου μοι\r\nγενομένου, τοῦ σοφιστοῦ φημί, λέληθεν οὐδέν σε. ἀποδημίας δὲ οὐχ ὑπέστην\r\nτῶν φίλων ἕνεκα; καίτοι Καρτερίῳ μὲν οἶσθ᾽ ὅπως [D] συνηράμην πρὸς τὸν\r\nἑταῖρον ἡμῖν ἀφικόμενος Ἀράξιον ἄκλητος, ὑπὲρ αὐτοῦ δεησόμενος. ὑπὲρ δὲ\r\nτῶν τῆς θαυμασίας Ἀρετῆς κτημάτων καὶ ὧν ἐπεπόνθει παρὰ τῶν γειτόνων οὐκ\r\nεἰς τὴν Φρυγίαν τὸ δεύτερον ἀφικόμην ἐν οὐδὲ ὅλοις μησὶ δύο, ἀσθενοῦς ἤδη\r\nμοι παντελὼς ὄντος τοῦ σώματος διὰ τὴν ἐπιγενομένην ὑπὸ τῆς πρότερον\r\nκακοπαθείας ἀρρωστίαν; ἀλλὰ δὴ τὸ τελευταῖον πρὸ τῆς εἰς τὴν Ἑλλάδα\r\nγενομένης ἡμῖν ἀφίξεως, ὅτε περὶ τῶν ἐσχάτων, ὡς ἂν εἴποιεν οἱ πολλοί,\r\nκινδυνεύων ἐγὼ τῷ στρατοπέδῳ παρέμενον, [260] ὁποίας ἔγραφον ἐπιστολὰς\r\nπρὸς σὲ νῦν ὑπομνήσθητι, μήποτε ὀδυρμῶν πλήρεις, μήτι μικρὸν ἢ ταπεινὸν ἢ\r\nλίαν ἀγεννὲς ἐχούσας. ἀπιὼν δὲ ἐπὶ τὴν Ἑλλάδα πάλιν, ὅτε με φεύγειν\r\nἐνόμιζον πάντες, οὐχ ὡς ἐν ἑορτῇ τῇ μεγίστῃ τὴν τύχην ἐπαινῶν ἡδίστην ἔφην\r\nεἶναι τὴν ἀμοιβὴν ἐμοὶ [B] καὶ τὸ δὴ λεγόμενον\r\n\r\n(I have purposely set down the whole of this speech for you lest you\r\nshould think that I am cheating and defrauding by bringing forward ancient\r\nmyths which may have some resemblance to the truth, but on the whole are\r\nnot composed with regard to truth. But what is the true meaning of this\r\nnarrative? You hear what it says, that even though a prince be by nature\r\nhuman, he must in his conduct be divine and a demi‐god and must completely\r\nbanish from his soul all that is mortal and brutish, except what must\r\nremain to safeguard the needs of the body. Now if, reflecting on this, one\r\nis afraid to be constrained to adopt a life from which so much is\r\nexpected, do you therefore conclude that one admires the inaction\r\nrecommended by Epicurus, the gardens and suburbs of Athens and its\r\nmyrtles, or the humble home of Socrates? But never has anyone seen me\r\nprefer these to a life of toil. That toil of mine I would willingly\r\nrecount to you, and the hazards that threatened me from my friends and\r\nkinsfolk at the time when I began to study under you, if you did not\r\nyourself know them well enough. You are well aware of what I did, in the\r\nfirst place, in Ionia in opposition to one who was related to me by ties\r\nof blood, but even more closely by ties of friendship, and that in behalf\r\nof a foreigner with whom I was very slightly acquainted, I mean the\r\nsophist. Did I not endure to leave the country for the sake of my friends?\r\nIndeed, you know how I took the part of Carterius when I went unsolicited\r\nto our friend Araxius to plead for him. And in behalf of the property of\r\nthat admirable woman Arete and the wrongs she had suffered from her\r\nneighbours, did I not journey to Phrygia for the second time within two\r\nmonths, though I was physically very weak from the illness that had been\r\nbrought on by former fatigues?(396) Finally, before I went to Greece,\r\nwhile I was still with the army and running what most people would call\r\nthe greatest possible risks, recall now what sort of letters I wrote to\r\nyou, never filled with complaints or containing anything little or mean or\r\nservile. And when I returned to Greece, when everyone regarded me as an\r\nexile, did I not welcome my fate as though it were some high festival, and\r\ndid I not say that the exchange to me was most delightful, and that, as\r\nthe saying is, I had thereby gained)\r\n\r\n\r\n    χρύσεα χαλκείων, ἑκατόμβοι᾽ ἐννεαβοίων\r\n\r\n    (“gold for bronze, the price of a hundred oxen for the price of\r\n    nine”?(397))\r\n\r\n\r\nἔφην ἀντηλλάχθαι; οὕτως ἀντὶ τῆς ἐμαυτοῦ ἑστίας τὴν Ἑλλάδα λαχὼν ἐγανύμην,\r\nοὐχ ἀγρόν, οὐ κῆπον, οὐ δωμάτιον ἐκεῖ κεκτημένος.\r\n\r\nSo great was my joy at obtaining the chance to live in Greece instead of\r\nin my own home, though I possessed there no land or garden or the humblest\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nἉλλὰ ἴσως ἔοικα ἐγὼ τὰς μὲν δυσπραγίας οὐκ ἀγεννῶς φέρειν, πρὸς δὲ τὰς\r\nπαρὰ τῆς τύχης δωρεὰς ἀγεννής τις εἶναι καὶ μικρός, ὅ γε ἀγαπῶν τὰς Ἀθήνας\r\nμᾶλλον τοῦ νῦν περὶ ἡμᾶς ὄγκου, τὴν σχολὴν δήπουθεν ἐκείνην ἐπαινῶν, διὰ\r\nδὲ τὸ [C] πλῆθος τῶν πράξεων τοῦτον αἰτιώμενος τὸν βίον; ἀλλὰ μή ποτε χρὴ\r\nπερὶ ἡμῶν ἄμεινον κρίνειν, οὐκ εἰς ἀπραξίαν καὶ πρᾶξιν βλέποντας, μᾶλλον\r\nδὲ εἰς τὸ Γνῶθι σαυτὸν καὶ τὸ\r\n\r\n(But perhaps you think that though I can bear adversity in the proper\r\nspirit, yet I show a poor and mean spirit towards the good gifts of\r\nFortune, seeing that I prefer Athens to the pomp that now surrounds me;\r\nbecause, you will doubtless say, I approve the leisure of those days and\r\ndisparage my present life because of the vast amount of work that the\r\nlatter involves.

And now I will write out a passage from Aristotle to the same\r\neffect, not “bringing owls to the Athenians,”(404) but in order to show\r\nyou that I do not entirely neglect his writings. In his political\r\ntreatises he says: “Now even if one maintain the principle that it is best\r\nfor cities to be governed by a king, how will it be about his children?\r\nOught his children to succeed him? And yet if they prove to be no better\r\nthan anybody else, that would be a bad thing for the city. But you may\r\nsay, though he has the power he will not leave the succession to his\r\nchildren? It is difficult indeed to believe that he will not; for that\r\nwould be too hard for him, and demands a virtue greater than belongs to\r\nhuman nature.”(405) And later on, when he is describing a so‐called king\r\nwho rules according to law, and says that he is both the servant and\r\nguardian of the laws, he does not call him a king at all, nor does he\r\nconsider such a king as a distinct form of government; and he goes on to\r\nsay: “Now as for what is called absolute monarchy, that is to say, when a\r\nking governs all other men according to his own will, some people think\r\nthat it is not in accordance with the nature of things for one man to have\r\nabsolute authority over all the citizens; since those who are by nature\r\nequal must necessarily have the same rights.”(406) Again, a little later\r\nhe says: “It seems, therefore, that he who bids Reason rule is really\r\npreferring the rule of God and the laws, but he who bids man rule, adds an\r\nelement of the beast. For desire is a wild beast, and passion which warps\r\neven the best men. It follows, therefore, that law is Reason exempt from\r\ndesire.” You see the philosopher seems here clearly to distrust and\r\ncondemn human nature. For he says so in so many words when he asserts that\r\nhuman nature is in no case worthy of such an excess of fortune. For he\r\nthinks that it is too hard for one who is merely human to prefer the\r\ngeneral weal of the citizens to his own children; he says that it is not\r\njust that one man should rule over many who are his equals; and, finally,\r\nhe puts the finishing stroke(407) to what he has just said when he asserts\r\nthat “law is Reason exempt from desire,” and that political affairs ought\r\nto be entrusted to Reason alone, and not to any individual man whatever.\r\nFor the reason that is in men, however good they may be, is entangled with\r\npassion and desire, those most ferocious monsters. These opinions, it\r\nseems to me, harmonise perfectly with Plato’s; first, that he who governs\r\nought to be superior to his subjects and surpass them not only in his\r\nacquired habits but also in natural endowment; a thing which is not easy\r\nto find among men;... thirdly, that he ought by every means in his power\r\nto observe the laws, not those that were framed to meet some sudden\r\nemergency, or established, as now appears, by men whose lives were not\r\nwholly guided by reason; but he must observe them only in case the\r\nlawgiver, having purified his mind and soul, in enacting those laws keeps\r\nin view not merely the crimes of the moment or immediate contingencies;\r\nbut rather recognises the nature of government and the essential nature of\r\njustice, and has carefully observed also the essential nature of guilt,\r\nand then applies to his task all the knowledge thus derived, and frames\r\nlaws which have a general application to all the citizens without regard\r\nto friend or foe, neighbour or kinsman. And it is better that such a\r\nlawgiver should frame and promulgate his laws not for his contemporaries\r\nonly but for posterity also, or for strangers with whom he neither has nor\r\nexpects to have any private dealings. For instance, I hear that the wise\r\nSolon, having consulted his friends about the cancelling of debts,\r\nfurnished them with an opportunity to make money, but brought on himself a\r\ndisgraceful accusation.(408) So hard is it to avoid such fatalities, even\r\nwhen a man brings a passionless mind to the task of governing.)\r\n\r\nἋ δεδιὼς ἐγὼ πολλάκις εἰκότως ἐπαινῶ τὸν ἔμπροσθεν βίον, καὶ σοὶ\r\nπειθόμενος μάλιστα ταῦτα ἐγὼ διανοοῦμαι, οὐχ ὅτι μοι τὸν ζῆλον πρὸς\r\nἐκείνους μόνον ἔφης προκεῖσθαι τοὺς ἄνδρας, Σόλωνα καὶ Λυκοῦργον καὶ\r\nΠιττακόν, ἀλλὰ καὶ ὅτι μεταβῆναί με φὴς ἐκ τῆς ὑποστέγου φιλοσοφίας πρὸς\r\nτὴν ὑπαίθριον.

And you\r\nwill very soon inform me whether my present view is correct, or whether I\r\nam in part deceived as to my proper course or whether indeed I am wholly\r\nmistaken.)\r\n\r\n[C] Ὑπὲρ δὲ ὧν ἀπορῆσαί μοι πρὸς τὴν ἐπιστολὴν τὴν σὴν παρέστη, ὦ φίλη\r\nκεφαλὴ καὶ πάσης ἔμοιγε τιμῆς ἀξία, βούλομαι δηλῶσαι· σαφέστερον γάρ πως\r\nὑπὲρ αὐτῶν ἐπιθυμῶ μαθεῖν. ἔφησθα ὅτι τὸν ἐν τῇ πράξει παρὰ τὸν φιλόσοφον\r\nἐπαινεῖς βίον, καὶ τὸν Ἀριστοτέλη τὸν σοφὸν ἐκάλεις μάρτυρα, τὴν\r\nεὐδαιμονίαν ἐν τῷ πράττειν εὖ τιθέμενον, καὶ τὴν διαφορὰν σκοποῦντα τοῦ τε\r\nπολιτικοῦ βίου καὶ τῆς ἐν τῇ θεωρίᾳ ζωῆς, διαπορεῖν ἄττα περὶ αὐτῶν, καὶ\r\nτὴν μὲν θεωρίαν ἐν ἄλλοις προτιμᾶν, ἐπαινεῖν δὲ ἐνταῦθα τοὺς τῶν καλῶν\r\nπράξεων ἀρχιτέκτονας.

You said\r\nthat you approve a life of action rather than the philosophic life, and\r\nyou called to witness the wise Aristotle who defines happiness as virtuous\r\nactivity, and discussing the difference between the statesman’s life and\r\nthe life of contemplation, showed a certain hesitation about those lives,\r\nand though in others of his writings he preferred the contemplative life,\r\nin this place you say he approves the architects of noble actions. But it\r\nis you who assert that these are kings, whereas Aristotle does not speak\r\nin the sense of the words that you have introduced: and from what you have\r\nquoted one would rather infer the contrary. For when he says: “We most\r\ncorrectly use the word ‘act’ of those who are the architects of public\r\naffairs by virtue of their intelligence,”(409) we must suppose that what\r\nhe says applies to lawgivers and political philosophers and all whose\r\nactivity consists in the use of intelligence and reason, but that it does\r\nnot apply to those who do the work themselves and those who transact the\r\nbusiness of politics. But in their case it is not enough that they should\r\nconsider and devise and instruct others as to what must be done, but it is\r\ntheir duty to undertake and execute whatever the laws ordain and\r\ncircumstances as well often force them; unless indeed we call that man an\r\narchitect who is “well versed in mighty deeds,”(410) a phrase which Homer\r\nin his poems usually applies to Heracles, who was indeed of all men that\r\never lived most given to do the work himself.)\r\n\r\n[B] Εἰ δὲ τοῦτ᾽ ἀληθὲς ὑπολαμβάνομεν ἢ καὶ μόνον ἐν τῇ πράττειν τὰ κοινά\r\nφαμεν εὐδαίμονας τοὺς κυρίους(411) ὄντας καὶ βασιλεύοντας πολλῶν, τί ποτε\r\nπερὶ Σωκράτους ἐροῦμεν; Πυθαγόραν δὲ καὶ Δημόκριτον καὶ τὸν Κλαζομένιον\r\nἈναξαγόραν ἴσως διὰ τὴν θεωρίαν κατ᾽ ἄλλο φήσεις εὐδαίμονας· Σωκράτης δὲ\r\nτὴν θεωρίαν παραιτησάμενος καὶ τὸν πρακτικὸν ἀγαπήσας βίον οὐδὲ τῆς\r\nγαμετῆς ἦν τῆς αὑτοῦ κύριος οὐδὲ τοῦ παιδός· [C] ἦπού γε δυοῖν ἢ τριῶν\r\nπολιτῶν ἐκείνῳ κρατεῖν ὑπῆρχεν; ἆρ᾽ οὖν οὐκ ἦν ἐκεῖνος πρακτικός, ἐπεὶ\r\nμηδενὸς ἦν κύριος; ἐγὼ μὲν οὖν Ἀλεξάνδρου φημὶ μείζονα τὸν Σωφρονίσκου\r\nκατεργάσασθαι, τὴν Πλάτωνος αὐτῷ σοφίαν ἀνατιθείς, τὴν Ξενοφῶντος\r\nστρατηγίαν, τὴν Ἀντισθένους ἀνδρείαν, τὴν Ἐρετρικὴν φιλοσοφίαν, τὴν\r\nΜεγαρικήν, τὸν Κέβητα, τὸν Σιμμίαν, [D] τὸν Φαίδωνα, μυρίους ἄλλους· καὶ\r\nοὔπω φημὶ τὰς γενομένας ἡμῖν ἐνθένδ᾽ ἀποικίας, τὸ Λύκειον, τὴν Στοάν, τὰς\r\nἈκαδημείας. τίς οὖν ἐσώθη διὰ τὴν Ἀλεξάνδρου νίκην; τίς πόλις ἄμεινον\r\nᾠκήθη; τίς αὑτοῦ γέγονε βελτίων ἰδιώτης ἀνήρ; πλουσιωτέρους μὲν γὰρ\r\nπολλοὺς ἂν εὕροις, σοφώτερον δὲ οὐδένα οὐδὲ σωφρονέστερον αὐτὸν αὑτοῦ, εἰ\r\nμὴ καὶ μᾶλλον ἀλαζόνα καὶ ὑπερόπτην. ὅσοι δὲ σώζονται νῦν ἐκ φιλοσοφίας,\r\nδιὰ τὸν Σωκράτη σώζονται. καὶ τοῦτο οὐκ ἐγὼ μόνος, [265] Ἀριστοτέλης δὲ\r\nπρότερος(412) ἔοικεν ἐννοήσας εἰπεῖν, ὅτι μὴ μεῖον αὐτῷ προσήκει φρονεῖν\r\nἐπὶ τῆς θεολογικῇ συγγραφῇ τοῦ καθελόντος τὴν Περσῶν δύναμιν. καί μοι\r\nδοκεῖ τοῦτο ἐκεῖνος ὀρθῶς ξυννοῆσαι· νικᾶν μὲν γὰρ ἀνδρείας ἐστὶ μάλιστα\r\nκαὶ τῆς τύχης, κείσθω δέ, εἰ βούλει, καὶ τῆς ἐντρεχοῦς ταύτης φρονήσεως,\r\nἀληθεῖς δὲ ὑπὲρ τοῦ θεοῦ δόξας ἀναλαβεῖν οὐκ ἀρετῆς μόνον τῆς τελείας\r\nἔργον ἐστίν, [B] ἀλλ᾽ ἐπιστήσειεν ἄν τις εἰκότως, πότερον χρὴ τὸν τοιοῦτον\r\nἄνδρα ἢ θεὸν καλεῖν. εἰ γὰρ ὀρθῶς ἔχει τὸ λεγόμενον, ὅτι πέφυκεν ἕκαστον\r\nὑπὸ τῶν οἰκείων γνωρίζεσθαι, τὴν θείαν οὐσίαν ὁ γνωρίσας θεῖός τις ἂν\r\nεἰκότως νομίζοιτο.\r\n\r\n(But if we conceive this to be true, or that only those are happy who\r\nadminister public affairs and who are in authority and rule over many,\r\nwhat then are we to say about Socrates? As for Pythagoras and Democritus\r\nand Anaxagoras of Clazomenae, you will perhaps say that they were happy in\r\nanother sense of the word, because of their philosophic speculations. But\r\nas for Socrates who, having rejected the speculative life and embraced a\r\nlife of action, had no authority over his own wife or his son, can we say\r\nof him that he governed even two or three of his fellow‐citizens? Then\r\nwill you assert that since he had no authority over any one he\r\naccomplished nothing? On the contrary I maintain that the son of\r\nSophroniscus(413) performed greater tasks than Alexander, for to him I\r\nascribe the wisdom of Plato, the generalship of Xenophon, the fortitude of\r\nAntisthenes, the Eretrian(414) and Megarian(415) philosophies, Cebes,\r\nSimmias,(416) Phaedo and a host of others; not to mention the offshoots\r\nderived from the same source, the Lyceum, the Stoa and the Academies. Who,\r\nI ask, ever found salvation through the conquests of Alexander? What city\r\nwas ever more wisely governed because of them, what individual improved?\r\nMany indeed you might find whom those conquests enriched, but not one whom\r\nthey made wiser or more temperate than he was by nature, if indeed they\r\nhave not made him more insolent and arrogant. Whereas all who now find\r\ntheir salvation in philosophy owe it to Socrates. And I am not the only\r\nperson to perceive this fact and to express it, for Aristotle it seems did\r\nso before me, when he said that he had just as much right to be proud of\r\nhis treatise on the gods as the conqueror(417) of the Persian empire. And\r\nI think he was perfectly correct in that conclusion. For military success\r\nis due to courage and good fortune more than anything else or, let us say,\r\nif you wish, to intelligence as well, though of the common everyday sort.\r\nBut to conceive true opinions about God is an achievement that not only\r\nrequires perfect virtue, but one might well hesitate whether it be proper\r\nto call one who attains to this a man or a god. For if the saying is true\r\nthat it is the nature of everything to become known to those who have an\r\naffinity with it, then he who comes to know the essential nature of God\r\nwould naturally be considered divine.)\r\n\r\nἈλλ᾽ ἐπειδὴ πάλιν ἐοίκαμεν εἰς τὸν θεωρηματικὸν ὁρμήσαντες βίον τούτῳ\r\nπαραβάλλειν τὸν πρακτικόν, ἐξ ἐρχῆς παραιτησαμένου καὶ σοῦ τὴν σύγκρισιν,\r\n[C] αὐτῶν ἐκείνων, ὧν ἐπεμνήσθης, Ἀρείου, Νικολάου, Θρασύλλου καὶ\r\nΜουσωνίου μνημονεύσω. τούτων γὰρ οὐχ ὅπως τις ἦν κύριος τῆς αὑτοῦ πόλεως,\r\nἀλλ᾽ ὁ μὲν Ἄρειος, ὡς φασί, καὶ διδομένην αὐτῷ τὴν Αἴγυπτον ἐπιτροπεῦσαι\r\nπαρῃτήσατο, Θράσυλλος δὲ Τιβερίῳ πικρῷ καὶ φύσει χαλεπῷ τυράννῳ\r\nξυγγενόμενος, εἰ μὴ διὰ τῶν καταλειφθέντων ὑπ᾽ αὐτοῦ λόγων ἀπελογήσατο,\r\nδείξας ὅστις ἦν, [D] ὦφλεν ἂν εἰς τέλος αἰσχύνην ἀναπάλλακτον, οὕτως αὐτὸν\r\nοὐδὲν ὤνησεν ἡ πολιτεία, Νικόλαος δὲ πράξεων μὲν οὐ μεγάλων αὐτουργὸς\r\nγέγονε γνώριμος δέ ἐστι μὰλλον διὰ τοὺς ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν λόγους, καὶ Μουσώνιος\r\nἐξ ὧν ἔπαθεν ἀνδρείως καὶ νὴ Δί᾽ ἤνεγκεν ἐγκρατῶς τὴν τῶν τυράννων ὠμότητα\r\nγέγονε γνώριμος, ἴσως οὐκ ἔλαττον εὐδαιμονῶν ἐκείνων τῶν τὰς μεγάλας\r\nἐπιτροπευσάντων βασιλείας.

Nicolaus did not personally do any great deeds, and he is\r\nknown rather by his writings about such deeds; while Musonius became\r\nfamous because he bore his sufferings with courage, and, by Zeus,\r\nsustained with firmness the cruelty of tyrants; and perhaps he was not\r\nless happy than those who administered great kingdoms. As for Areius, when\r\nhe declined the governorship of Egypt he deliberately deprived himself of\r\nthe highest end, if he really thought that this was the most important\r\nthing. And you yourself,—may I ask, do you lead an inactive life because\r\nyou are not a general or a public speaker and govern no nation or city?\r\nNay, no one with any sense would say so. For it is in your power by\r\nproducing many philosophers, or even only three or four, to confer more\r\nbenefit on the lives of men than many kings put together. To no trivial\r\nprovince the philosopher appointed, and, as you said yourself, he does not\r\nonly direct counsels or public affairs, nor is his activity confined to\r\nmere words; but if he confirm his words by deeds and show himself to be\r\nsuch as he wishes others to be, he may be more convincing and more\r\neffective in making men act than those who urge them to noble actions by\r\nissuing commands.)\r\n\r\nἈλλ᾽ ἐπανιτέον εἰς ἀρχὴν καὶ συμπεραντέον τὴν ἐπιστολὴν μείζονα ἴσως οὖσαν\r\nτοῦ δέοντος. ἔστι δὲ ἐν αὐτῇ τὸ κεφάλαιον, ὅτι μήτε τὸν πόνον φεύγων μήτε\r\nτὴν ἡδονὴν θηρεύων μήτε ἀπραγμοσύνης καὶ ῥᾳστώνης ἐρῶν τὸν ἐν τῇ πολιτείᾳ\r\nδυσχεραίνω βίον· ἀλλ᾽, ὅπερ ἔφην ἐξ ἀρχῆς, οὔτε παιδείαν ἐμαυτῷ [D]\r\nσυνειδὼς τοσαύτην οὔτε φύσεως ὑπεροχήν, καὶ προσέτι δεδιώς, μὴ φιλοσφίαν,\r\nἧς ἐρῶν οὐκ ἐφικόμην, εἰς τοὺς νῦν ἀνθρώπους οὐδὲ ἄλλως εὐδοκιμοῦσαν\r\nδιαβάλλω, πάλαι τε ἔγραφον ἐκεῖνα καὶ νῦν τὰς παρ᾽ ὑμῶν ἐπιτιμήσεις\r\nἀπελυσάμην εἰς δύναμιν.\r\n\r\n(But I must go back to what I said at the beginning, and conclude this\r\nletter, which is perhaps longer already than it should be. And the main\r\npoint in it is that it is not because I would avoid hard work or pursue\r\npleasure, nor because I am in love with idleness and ease that I am averse\r\nto spending my life in administration. But, as I said when I began, it is\r\nbecause I am conscious that I have neither sufficient training nor natural\r\ntalents above the ordinary; moreover, I am afraid of bringing reproach on\r\nphilosophy, which, much as I love it, I have never attained to, and which\r\non other accounts has no very good reputation among men of our day. For\r\nthese reasons I wrote all this down some time ago, and now I have freed\r\nmyself from your charges as far as I can.)\r\n\r\nΔιδοίη δὲ ὁ θεὸς τὴν ἀρίστην τύχην καὶ φρόνησιν ἀξίαν τῆς τύχης, ὡς ἐγὼ\r\nνῦν ἔκ τε τοῦ κρείττονος τό γε πλέον καὶ παρ᾽ ὑμῶν τῶν φιλοσοφούντων [267]\r\nἁπάσῃ μηχανῇ(422) βοηθητέος εἶναί μοι δοκῶ, προτεταγμένος ὑμῶν καὶ\r\nπροκινδυνεύων. εἰ δέ τι μείζον ἀγαθὸν τῆς ἡμετέρας παρασκευῆς καὶ ἧς ὑπὲρ\r\nἐμαυτοῦ γνώμης ἔχω τοῖς ἀνθρώποις δι᾽ ἡμῶν ὁ θεὸς παράσχοι, χαλεπαίνειν οὐ\r\nχρὴ πρὸς τοὺς ἐμοὺς λόγους. ἐγὼ γὰρ οὐδὲν ἐμαυτῷ συνειδὼς ἀγαθὸν πλὴν\r\nτοῦτο μόνον, ὅτι μηδὲ οἴομαι τὰ μέγιστα ἔχειν ἔχων τε(423) οὐδέν, ὡς ὁρᾷς\r\nαὐτός, εἰκότως βοῶ καὶ μαρτύρομαι μὴ μεγάλα παρ᾽ ἡμῶν ἀπαιτεῖν, [B] ἀλλὰ\r\nτῷ θεῷ τὸ πᾶν ἐπιτρέπειν· οὕτω γὰρ ἐγὼ τῶν τε ἐλλειμμάτων εἴην ἂν\r\nἀνεύθυνος καί, γενομένων ἁπάντων δεξιῶν, εὐγνώμων ἂν καὶ μέτριος εἴην, οὐκ\r\nἀλλοτρίοις ἐμαυτὸν ἔργοις ἐπιγράφων, τῷ θεῷ δέ, ὥσπερ οὖν δίκαιον,\r\nπροσανατεθεικὼς ἅπαντα αὐτός τε εἴσομαι καὶ ὑμᾶς προτρέπω τὴν χάριν\r\nεἰδέναι.\r\n\r\n(May God grant me the happiest fortune possible, and wisdom to match my\r\nfortune! For now I think I need assistance from God above all, and also\r\nfrom you philosophers by all means in your power, since I have proved\r\nmyself your leader and champion in danger. But should it be that blessings\r\ngreater than of my furnishing and than the opinion that I now have of\r\nmyself should be granted to men by God through my instrumentality, you\r\nmust not resent my words. For being conscious or no good thing in me, save\r\nthis only, that I do not even think that I possess the highest talent, and\r\nindeed have naturally none, I cry aloud and testify(424) that you must not\r\nexpect great things of me, but must entrust everything to God. For thus I\r\nshall be free from responsibility for my shortcomings, and if everything\r\nturns out favourably I shall be discreet and moderate, not putting my name\r\nto the deeds of other men,(425) but by giving God the glory for all, as is\r\nright, it is to Him that I shall myself feel gratitude and I urge all of\r\nyou to feel the same.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER TO THE SENATE AND PEOPLE OF ATHENS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the manifestoes addressed by Julian to Rome, Sparta, Corinth, and\r\nAthens, defending his acceptance of the title of Emperor and his open\r\nrupture with Constantius, the last alone survives. It was written in\r\nIllyricum in 361, when Julian was on the march against Constantius, and is\r\nthe chief authority for the events that led to his elevation to the\r\nImperial rank. Julian writes to the Athenians of the fourth Christian\r\ncentury as though they still possessed the influence and standards of\r\ntheir forefathers. He was well known at Athens, where he had studied\r\nbefore his elevation to the Caesarship and he was anxious to clear himself\r\nin the eyes of the citizens. For the first time he ventures to speak the\r\ntruth about Constantius and to describe the latter’s ruthless treatment of\r\nhis family. His account of the revolution at Paris is supplemented by\r\nAmmianus 20, Zosimus 3. 9, and the _Epitaph on Julian_ by Libanius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nΙΟΥΛΙΑΝΟΥ ΑΥΤΟΚΡΑΤΟΡΟΣ\r\n\r\n(Julian, Emperor)\r\n\r\nΑΘΗΝΑΙΩΝ ΤΗΙ ΒΟΥΛΗΙ ΚΑΙ ΤΩΙ ΔΗΜΩΙ\r\n\r\n(To the Senate and People of Athens.)\r\n\r\nΠολλῶν εἰργασμένων τοῖς προγόνοις ὑμῶν, ἐφ᾽ οἷς οὐκ ἐκείνοις μόνον τότε\r\nἐξῆν, ἀλλὰ καὶ ὑμῖν νῦν ἔξεστι φιλοτιμεῖσθαι, καὶ πολλῶν ἐγηγερμένων\r\nτροπαίων ὑπέρ τε ἁπάσης τῆς Ἑλλάδος κοινῇ καὶ κατ᾽ ἰδίαν ὑπὲρ αὐτῆς τῆς\r\nπόλεως, ἐν οἷς ἠγωνίσατο μόνη πρός τε τοὺς ἄλλους Ἕλληνας καὶ πρὸς τὸν\r\nβάρβαρον, οὐδέν ἐστι τηλικοῦτον ἔργον οὐδὲ ἀνδραγαθία τοσαύτη, [B] πρὸς ἣν\r\nοὐκ ἔνεστι καὶ ταῖς ἄλλαις ἁμιλληθῆναι πόλεσι. τὰ μὲν γὰρ μεθ᾽ ὑμῶν καὶ\r\nαὗται, τὰ δὲ κατ᾽ ἰδίαν εἰργάσαντο. καὶ ἵνα μὴ μεμνημένος ἔπειτα\r\nἀντιπαραβάλλων ἢ προτιμᾶν ἑτέρας ἑτέραν ἐν οἷς διαμφισβητοῦσι νομισθείην ἢ\r\nπρὸς τὸ λυσιτελοῦν, ὥσπερ οἱ ῥήτορες, ἐνδεέστερον ἐπαινεῖν τὰς\r\nἐλαττουμένας, τοῦτο ἐθέλω [C] φράσαι μόνον ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν, ᾧ μηδὲν ἀντίπαλον\r\nἔχομεν ἐξευρεῖν παρὰ τοῖς ἄλλοις Ἕλλησιν, ἐκ τῆς παλαιᾶς φήμης εἰς ἡμᾶς\r\nπαραδεδομένον. ἀρχόντων μὲν Λακεδαιμονίων οὐ βίᾳ τὴν ἀρχήν, ἀλλὰ δόξῃ\r\nδικαιοσύνης παρείλεσθε, καὶ τὸν Ἀριστείδην τὸν δίκαιον οἱ παρ᾽ ὑμῖν\r\nἐθρέψαντο νόμοι. καίτοι γε ταῦτα οὕτως ὄντα λαμπρὰ τεκμήρια [269] διὰ\r\nλαμπροτέρων οἶμαι τῶν ἔργων ὅμως ἐπιστώσασθε. τὸ μὲν γὰρ δόξαι δίκαιον\r\nἴσως ἂν τῷ καὶ ψευδῶς συμβαίη, καὶ τυχὸν οὐ παράδοξον ἐν πολλοῖς φαύλοις\r\nἕνα γενέσθαι σπουδαῖον. ἢ γὰρ οὐχὶ καὶ παρὰ Μήδοις ὑμνεῖταί τις Δηιόκης\r\nἌβαρίς τε ἐν Ὑπερβορέοις καὶ Ἀνάχαρσις ἐν Σκύθαις; ὑπὲρ ὧν τοῦτο ἦν\r\nθαυμαστόν, ὅτι παρὰ τοῖς ἀδικωτάτοις γεγονότες ἔθνεσι τὴν δίκην ὅμως\r\nἐτίμησαν, τὼ μὲν ἀληθῶς, [B] ὁ δὲ τῆς χρείας χάριν πλαττόμενος. δῆμον δὲ\r\nὅλον καὶ πόλιν ἐραστὰς ἔργων καὶ λόγων δικαίων ἔξω τῆς παρ᾽ ὑμῖν οὐ ῥᾴδιον\r\nεὑρεῖν. βούλομαι δὲ ὑμᾶς ἑνὸς τῶν παρ᾽ ὑμῖν πολλῶν γε ὄντων ἔργων\r\nὑπομνῆσαι.

For they too wrought some such\r\ndeeds in alliance with you, and some on their own account. And that I may\r\nnot by recalling these and then balancing them be thought either to pay\r\nmore honour to one state than to another in the matters in which they are\r\nyour rivals, or to praise less than they deserve those who proved\r\ninferior, in order to gain an advantage, after the manner of rhetoricians,\r\nI desire to bring forward on your behalf only this fact to which I can\r\ndiscover nothing that can be set against it on the part of the other Greek\r\nstates, and which has been assigned to you by ancient tradition. When the\r\nLacedaemonians were in power you took that power away from them not by\r\nviolence but by your reputation for justice; and it was your laws that\r\nnurtured Aristides the Just. Moreover, brilliant as were these proofs of\r\nyour virtue, you confirmed them by still more brilliant actions. For to be\r\nreputed just might perhaps happen to any individual even though it were\r\nnot true; perhaps it would not be surprising that among many worthless\r\ncitizens there should be found one virtuous man. For even among the Medes\r\nis not a certain Deioces(426) celebrated, and Abaris(427) too among the\r\nHyperboreans, and Anacharsis(428) among the Scythians? And in their case\r\nthe surprising thing was that, born as they were among nations who knew\r\nnothing of justice, they nevertheless prized justice, two of them\r\nsincerely, though the third only pretended to do so out of self‐interest.\r\nBut it would be hard to find a whole people and city enamoured of just\r\ndeeds and just words except your own. And I wish to remind you of one out\r\nof very many such deeds done in your city. After the Persian war\r\nThemistocles(429) was planning to introduce a resolution to set fire\r\nsecretly to the naval arsenals of the Greeks, and then did not dare to\r\npropose it to the assembly; but he agreed to confide the secret to any one\r\nman whom the people should elect by vote; and the people chose Aristides\r\nto represent them. But he when he heard the scheme did not reveal what he\r\nhad been told, but reported to the people that there could be nothing more\r\nprofitable or more dishonest than that advice. Whereupon the city at once\r\nvoted against it and rejected it, very nobly, by Zeus, and as it behoved\r\nmen to do who are nurtured under the eyes of the most wise goddess.(430))\r\n\r\nΟὐκοῦν εἰ ταῦτα παρ᾽ ὑμῖν μὲν ἦν πάλαι, σώζεται δὲ ἐξ ἐκείνου καὶ εἰς ὑμᾶς\r\nἔτι τῆς τῶν προγόνων ἀρετῆς ὥσπερ ἐμπύρευμά τι σμικρόν, εἰκός ἐστιν ὑμᾶς\r\nοὐκ εἰς τὸ μέγεθος τῶν πραττομένων ἀφορᾶν οὐδὲ εἴ τις ὥσπερ δι᾽ ἀέρος\r\nἱπτάμενος διὰ τῆς γῆς ἐβάδισεν ἀμηχάνῳ τάχει καὶ ἀτρύτῳ ῥώμῃ, σκοπεῖν δὲ\r\nὅτῳ ταῦτα μετὰ τοῦ δικαίου κατείργασται, [270] κᾆτα ἂν μὲν φαίνηται ξὺν\r\nδίκῃ πράττων, ἰδίᾳ τε αὐτὸν ἴσως καὶ δημοσίᾳ πάντες ἐπαινεῖτε, τῆς δίκης\r\nδὲ ὀλιγωρήσας ἀτιμάζοιτο ἂν παρ᾽ ὑμῶν εἰκότως. οὐδὲν γὰρ οὕτως ἐστὶν ὡς τὸ\r\nδίκαιον ἀδελφὸν φρονήσει. τοὺς οὖν ἀτιμάζοντας τοῦτο δικαίως ἂν καὶ ὡς εἰς\r\nτὴν παρ᾽ ὑμῖν θεὸν ἀσεβοῦντας ἐξελαύνοιτε. βούλομαι οὖν ὑμῖν τὰ κατ᾽\r\nἐμαυτὸν οὐκ ἀγνοοῦσι μὲν ἀπαγγεῖλαι δὲ ὅμως, [B] ὅπως, εἴ τι λέληθεν·\r\nεἰκὸς δὲ ἔνια καὶ ὅσα μάλιστα τοῖς πᾶσι γνωσθῆναι προσήκει· ὑμῖν τε καὶ\r\nδι᾽ ὑμῶν τοῖς ἄλλοις Ἕλλησι γένοιτο γνώριμα. μηδεὶς οὖν ὑπολάβῃ με ληρεῖν\r\nἢ φλυαρεῖν, εἰ περὶ τῶν πᾶσιν ὥσπερ ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς γεγονότων οὐ πάλαι μόνον,\r\nἀλλὰ καὶ μικρῷ πρότερον, ποιεῖσθαί τινας ἐπιχειρήσαιμι λόγους· οὐδένα γὰρ\r\nοὐδὲν ἀγνοεῖν βούλομαι τῶν ἐμαυτοῦ, λανθάνειν δὲ ἄλλον ἄλλα εἰκός· [C]\r\nἄρξομαι δὲ ἀπὸ τῶν προγόνων πρῶτον τῶν ἐμαυτοῦ.\r\n\r\n(Then if this was your conduct of old, and from that day to this there is\r\nkept alive some small spark as it were of the virtue of your ancestors, it\r\nis natural that you should pay attention not to the magnitude merely of\r\nany performance, nor whether a man has travelled over the earth with\r\nincredible speed and unwearied energy as though he had flown through the\r\nair; but that you should rather consider whether one has accomplished this\r\nfeat by just means, and then if he seems to act with justice, you will\r\nperhaps all praise him both in public and private; but if he have slighted\r\njustice he will naturally be scorned by you. For there is nothing so\r\nclosely akin to wisdom as justice. Therefore those who slight her you will\r\njustly expel as showing impiety towards the goddess who dwells among you.\r\nFor this reason I wish to report my conduct to you, though indeed you know\r\nit well, in order that if there is anything you do not know—and it is\r\nlikely that some things you do not, and those in fact which it is most\r\nimportant for all men to be aware of—it may become known to you and\r\nthrough you to the rest of the Greeks. Therefore let no one think that I\r\nam trifling and wasting words if I try to give some account of things that\r\nhave happened as it were before the eyes of all men, not only long ago but\r\nalso just lately. For I wish none to be ignorant of anything that concerns\r\nme, and naturally everyone cannot know every circumstance. First I will\r\nbegin with my ancestors.)\r\n\r\nΚαὶ ὅτι μὲν τὰ πρὸς πατρὸς ἡμῖν ἐντεῦθεν ὅθενπερ καὶ Κωνσταντίῳ τὰ πρὸς\r\nπατρὸς ὥρμηται, φανερόν. τὼ γὰρ ἡμετέρω πατέρε γεγόνατον ἀδελφὼ πατρόθεν.\r\nοὕτω δὲ πλησίον ἡμᾶς ὄντας συγγενεῖς ὁ φιλανθρωπότατος οὗτος βασιλεὺς οἷα\r\nεἰργάσατο, ἓξ μὲν ἀνεψιοὺς ἐμοῦ τε καὶ ἑαυτοῦ, πατέρα δὲ τὸν ἐμόν,(431)\r\nἑαυτοῦ δὲ θεῖον, [D] καὶ προσέτι κοινὸν ἕτερον τὸν πρὸς πατρὸς θεῖον\r\nἀδελφόν τε ἐμὸν τὸν πρεσβύτατον ἀκρίτους κτεῖνας, ἐμὲ δὲ καὶ ἕτερον\r\nἀδελφὸν ἐμὸν ἐθελήσας μὲν κτεῖναι, τέλος δὲ ἐπιβαλὼν φυγήν, ἀφ᾽ ἧς ἐμὲ μὲν\r\nἀφῆκεν, ἐκεῖνον δὲ ὀλίγῳ πρότερον τῆς σφαγῆς ἐξέδυσε(432) τὸ τοῦ Καίσαρος\r\nὄνομα, τί με δεῖ νῦν ὥσπερ ἐκ τραγῳδίας τὰ ἄρρητα ἀναμετρεῖσθαι;\r\nμετεμέλησε γὰρ αὐτῷ, φασί, καὶ ἐδήχθη δεινῶς, [271] ἀπαιδίαν τε ἐντεῦθεν\r\nνομίζει δυστυχεῖν, τά τε ἐς τοὺς πολεμίους τοὺς Πέρσας οὐκ εὐτυχῶς\r\nπράττειν ἐκ τούτων ὑπολαμβάνει. ταῦτα ἐθρύλουν οἱ περὶ τὴν αὐλὴν τότε καὶ\r\nτὸν μακαρίτην ἀδελφὸν ἐμὸν Γάλλον, τοῦτο νῦν πρῶτον ἀκούοντα τὸ ὄνομα·\r\nκτείνας γὰρ αὐτὸν παρὰ τοὺς νόμους οὐδὲ τῶν πατρῴων μεταλαχεῖν εἴασε τάφων\r\nοὐδὲ τῆς εὐαγοῦς ἠξίωσε μνήμης.\r\n\r\n(That on the father’s side I am descended from the same stock as\r\nConstantius on his father’s side is well known. Our fathers were brothers,\r\nsons of the same father. And close kinsmen as we were, how this most\r\nhumane Emperor treated us! Six of my cousins and his, and my father who\r\nwas his own uncle and also another uncle of both of us on the father’s\r\nside, and my eldest brother, he put to death without a trial; and as for\r\nme and my other brother,(433) he intended to put us to death but finally\r\ninflicted exile upon us; and from that exile he released me, but him he\r\nstripped of the title of Caesar just before he murdered him. But why\r\nshould I “recount,” as though from some tragedy, “all these unspeakable\r\nhorrors?”(434) For he has repented, I am told, and is stung by remorse;\r\nand he thinks that his unhappy state of childlessness is due to those\r\ndeeds, and his ill success in the Persian war he also ascribes to that\r\ncause. This at least was the gossip of the court at the time and of those\r\nwho were about the person of my brother Gallus of blessed memory, who is\r\nnow for the first time so styled. For after putting him to death in\r\ndefiance of the laws he neither suffered him to share the tombs of his\r\nancestors nor granted him a pious memory.)\r\n\r\nὍπερ οὖν ἔφην, [B] ἔλεγον τοσαῦτα καὶ δὴ καὶ ἔπειθον ἡμᾶς,(435) ὅτι τὰ μὲν\r\nἀπατηθεὶς εἰργάσατο, τὰ δὲ βίᾳ καὶ ταραχαῖς εἴξας ἀτάκτου καὶ ταραχώδους\r\nστρατεύματος. τοσαῦτα ἡμῖν ἐπῇδον ἐν ἀγρῷ τινι τῶν ἐν Καππαδοκίᾳ\r\nκατακεκλεισμένοις, οὐδένα ἐῶντες προσελθεῖν, τὸν μὲν ἀπὸ τῆς ἐν\r\nΤράλλεσι(436) φυγῆς ἀνακαλεσάμενοι, ἐμὲ δὲ κομιδῇ μειράκιον ἔτι τῶν\r\nδιδασκαλείων ἀπαγαγόντες. πῶς [C] ἂν ἐνταῦθα φράσαιμι περὶ τῶν ἓξ\r\nἐνιαυτῶν, οὓς ἐν ἀλλοτρίῳ κτήματι διάγοντες,(437) ὥσπερ οἱ παρὰ τοῖς\r\nΠέρσαις ἐν τοῖς φρουρίοις τηρούμενοι, μηδενὸς ἡμῖν προσιόντος ξένου μηδὲ\r\nτῶν πάλαι γνωρίμων ἐπιτρεπομένου τινὸς ὡς ἡμᾶς φοιτᾶν, διεζῶμεν\r\nἀποκεκλεισμένοι παντὸς μὲν μαθήματος σπουδαίου, πάσης δὲ ἐλευθέρας\r\nἐντεύξεως, ἐν ταῖς λαμπραῖς οἰκετείαις τρεφόμενοι [D] καὶ τοῖς ἡμῶν αὐτῶν\r\nδούλοις ὥσπερ ἑταίροις συγγυμναζόμενοι; προσῄει γὰρ οὐδεὶς οὐδὲ ἐπετρέπετο\r\nτῶν ἡλικιωτῶν.\r\n\r\n(As I said, they kept telling us and tried to convince us that Constantius\r\nhad acted thus, partly because he was deceived, and partly because he\r\nyielded to the violence and tumult of an undisciplined and mutinous army.\r\nThis was the strain they kept up to soothe us when we had been imprisoned\r\nin a certain farm(438) in Cappadocia; and they allowed no one to come near\r\nus after they had summoned him from exile in Tralles and had dragged me\r\nfrom the schools, though I was still a mere boy. How shall I describe the\r\nsix years we spent there? For we lived as though on the estate of a\r\nstranger, and were watched as though we were in some Persian garrison,\r\nsince no stranger came to see us and not one of our old friends was\r\nallowed to visit us; so that we lived shut off from every liberal study\r\nand from all free intercourse, in a glittering servitude, and sharing the\r\nexercises of our own slaves though they were comrades. For no companion of\r\nour own age ever came near us or was allowed to do so.)\r\n\r\nἘντεῦθεν ἐγὼ μὲν μόγις ἀφείθην διὰ τοὺς θεοὺς εὐτυχῶς, ὁ δὲ ἀδελφὸς ὁ ἐμὸς\r\nεἰς τὴν αὐλὴν καθείρχθη δυστυχῶς, εἴπερ τις ἄλλος τῶν πώποτε. καὶ γὰρ εἴ\r\nτι περὶ τὸν τρόπον ἄγριον καὶ τραχὺ τὸν ἐκείνου κατεφάνη, τοῦτο ἐκ τῆς\r\nὀρείου τροφῆς συνηυξήθη. δίκαιος οὖν οἶμαι καὶ ταύτην ἔχειν τὴν αἰτίαν ὁ\r\nταύτης ἡμῖν πρὸς βίαν μεταδοὺς τῆς τροφῆς, ἧς ἐμὲ μὲν οἱ θεοὶ διὰ [272]\r\nτῆς φιλοσοφίας καθαρὸν ἀπέφηναν καὶ ἐξάντη, τῷ δὲ οὐδεὶς ἐνέδωκεν. εὐθὺς\r\nγὰρ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀγρῶν ἐς τὰ βασίλεια παρελθόντι ἐπειδὴ πρῶτον αὐτῷ περιέθηκεν\r\nἁλουργὲς ἱμάτιον, αὐτίκα φθονεῖν ἀρξάμενος οὐ πρότερον ἐπαύσατο πρὶν\r\nκαθελεῖν αὐτόν, οὐδὲ τῷ περιελεῖν τὸ πορφυροῦν ἱμάτιον ἀρκεσθείς. καίτοι\r\nτοῦ ζῆν γοῦν ἄξιος, εἰ μὴ βασιλεύειν ἐφαίνετο ἐπιτήδειος. ἀλλ᾽ ἐχρῆν αὐτὸν\r\nκαὶ τούτου στέρεσθαι. ξυγχωρῶ, [B] λόγον γε πάντως ὑποσχόντα πρότερον,\r\nὥσπερ τοὺς κακούργους. οὐ γὰρ δὴ τοὺς μὲν λῃστὰς ὁ νόμος ἀπαγορεύει τῷ\r\nδήσαντι κτείνειν, τοὺς ἁφαιρεθέντας δὲ τιμάς, ἃς εἶχον, καὶ γενομένους ἐξ\r\nἀρχόντων ἰδιώτας ἀκρίτους φησὶ δεῖν ἀναιρεῖσθαι. τί γάρ, εἰ τῶν\r\nἁμαρτημάτων εἶχεν ἀποφῆναι [C] τοῦς αἰτίους; ἐδέδοντο γὰρ αὐτῷ τινων\r\nἐπιστολαί, Ἡράκλεις, ὅσας ἔχουσαι κατ᾽ αὐτοῦ κατηγορίας, ἐφ᾽ αἷς ἐκεῖνος\r\nἀγανακτῆσας ἀκρατέστερον μὲν καὶ ἥκιστα βασιλικῶς ἐφῆκε τῷ θυμῷ, τοῦ\r\nμέντοι μηδὲ ζῆν ἄξιον οὐδὲν ἐπεπράχει. πῶς γάρ; οὐχ οὗτός ἐστιν ἀνθρώποις\r\nἅπασι κοινὸς Ἕλλησιν ἅμα καὶ βαρβάροις ὁ νόμος, ἀμύνεσθαι τοὺς ἀδικίας\r\nὑπάρχοντας; ἀλλ᾽ ἴσως μὲν ἠμύνατο πικρότερον. οὐ μὴν ἔξω πάντη τοῦ\r\nεἰκότος· τὸν γὰρ ἐχθρὸν ὑπ᾽ ὀργῆς εἰκός τι καὶ ποιεῖν, [D] εἴρηται καὶ\r\nπρόσθεν. ἀλλ᾽ εἰς χάριν ἑνὸς ἀνδρογύνου, τοῦ κατακοιμιστοῦ, καὶ προσέτι\r\nτοῦ τῶν μαγείρων ἐπιτρόπου τὸν ἀνεψιόν, τὸν καίσαρα, τὸν τῆς ἀδελφῆς ἄνδρα\r\nγενόμενον, τὸν τῆς ἀδελφιδῆς πατέρα, οὗ καὶ αὐτὸς πρότερον ἦν ἀγαγόμενος\r\nτὴν ἀδελφήν, πρὸς ὃν αὐτῷ τοσαῦτα θεῶν ὁμογνίων ὑπῆρχε δίκαια, κτεῖναι\r\nπαρέδωκε τοῖς ἐχθίστοις· ἐμὲ δὲ ἀφῆκε μόγις ἑπτὰ μηνῶν ὅλων ἑλκύσας τῇδε\r\nκἀκεῖσε καὶ ποιησάμενος ἔμφρουρον, [273] ὥστε, εἰ μὴ θεῶν τις ἐθελήσας με\r\nσωθῆναι τὴν καλὴν καὶ ἀγαθὴν τὸ τηνικαῦτά μοι παρέσχεν εὐμενῆ Εὐσεβίαν,\r\nοὐδ᾽ ἂν ἐγὼ τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῦ τότε διέφυγον. καίτοι μὰ τοὺς θεοὺς οὐδ᾽ ὄναρ\r\nμοι φανεὶς ἀδελφὸς ἐπεπράχει· καὶ γὰρ οὐδὲ συνῆν αὐτῷ οὐδὲ ἐφοίτων οὐδὲ\r\nἐβάδιζον παρ᾽ αὐτὸν, ὀλιγάκις δὲ ἔγραφον καὶ ὑπὲρ ὀλίγων.

And indeed whatever\r\ncruelty or harshness was revealed in his disposition was increased by his\r\nhaving been brought up among those mountains. It is therefore I think only\r\njust that the Emperor should bear the blame for this also, he who against\r\nour will allotted to us that sort of bringing‐up. As for me, the gods by\r\nmeans of philosophy caused me to remain untouched by it and unharmed; but\r\non my brother no one bestowed this boon. For when he had come straight\r\nfrom the country to the court, the moment that Constantius had invested\r\nhim with the purple robe he at once began to be jealous of him, nor did he\r\ncease from that feeling until, not content with stripping him of the\r\npurple, he had destroyed him. Yet surely he deserved to live, even if he\r\nseemed unfit to govern. But someone may say that it was necessary to\r\ndeprive him of life also. I admit it, only on condition that he had first\r\nbeen allowed to speak in his own defence as criminals are. For surely it\r\nis not the case that the law forbids one who has imprisoned bandits to put\r\nthem to death, but says that it is right to destroy without a trial those\r\nwho have been stripped of the honours that they possessed and have become\r\nmere individuals instead of rulers. For what if my brother had been able\r\nto expose those who were responsible for his errors? For there had been\r\nhanded to him the letters of certain persons, and, by Heracles, what\r\naccusations against himself they contained! And in his resentment at these\r\nhe gave way in most unkingly fashion to uncontrolled anger, but he had\r\ndone nothing to deserve being deprived of life itself. What! Is not this a\r\nuniversal law among all Greeks and barbarians alike, that one should\r\ndefend oneself against those who take the initiative in doing one a wrong?\r\nI admit that he did perhaps defend himself with too great cruelty; but on\r\nthe whole not more cruelly than might have been expected. For we have\r\nheard it said before(439) that an enemy may be expected to harm one in a\r\nfit of anger. But it was to gratify a eunuch,(440) his chamberlain who was\r\nalso his chief cook, that Constantius gave over to his most inveterate\r\nenemies his own cousin, the Caesar, his sister’s husband, the father of\r\nhis niece, the man whose own sister he had himself married in earlier\r\ndays,(441) and to whom he owed so many obligations connected with the gods\r\nof the family. As for me he reluctantly let me go, after dragging me\r\nhither and thither for seven whole months and keeping me under guard; so\r\nthat had not some one of the gods desired that I should escape, and made\r\nthe beautiful and virtuous Eusebia kindly disposed to me, I could not then\r\nhave escaped from his hands myself. And yet I call the gods to witness\r\nthat my brother had pursued his course of action without my having a sight\r\nof him even in a dream. For I was not with him, nor did I visit him or\r\ntravel to his neighbourhood; and I used to write to him very seldom and on\r\nunimportant matters. Thinking therefore that I had escaped from that\r\nplace, I set out for the house that had been my mother’s. For of my\r\nfather’s estate nothing belonged to me, and I had acquired out of the\r\ngreat wealth that had naturally belonged to my father not the smallest\r\nclod of earth, not a slave, not a house. For the admirable Constantius had\r\ninherited in my place the whole of my father’s property, and to me, as I\r\nwas saying, he granted not the least trifle of it; moreover, though he\r\ngave my brother a few things that had been his father’s, he robbed him of\r\nthe whole of his mother’s estate.)\r\n\r\n[C] Ὅσα μὲν οὖν ἔπραξε πρός με πρὶν ὀνόματος μὲν μεταδοῦναί μοι τοῦ\r\nσεμνοτάτου, ἔργῳ δὲ εἰς πικροτάτην καὶ χαλεπωτάτην ἐμβαλεῖν δουλείαν, εἰ\r\nκαὶ μὴ πάντα, τὰ πλεῖστα γοῦν ὅμως ἀκηκόατε(442) πορευομένου δὴ(443)\r\nλοιπὸν ἐπὶ τὴν ἑστίαν, ἀγαπητῶς τε καὶ μόγις ἀποσωζομένου, συκοφάντης τις\r\nἀνεφάνη περὶ τὸ Σίρμιον, ὃς τοῖς ἐκεῖ πράγματα ἕρραψεν ὡς νεώτερα\r\nδιανοουμένοις· [D] ἴστε δήπουθεν ἀκοῇ τὸν Ἀφρικανὸν καὶ τὸν Μαρῖνον·\r\nοὔκουν ὑμᾶς οὐδὲ ὁ Φῆλιξ ἔλαθεν οὐδὲ ὅσα ἐπράχθη περὶ τοὺς ἀνθρώπους. ἀλλ᾽\r\nὡς τοῦτο αὐτῷ κατεμηνύθη τὸ πρᾶγμα, καὶ Δυνάμιος ἐξαίφνης, ἄλλος\r\nσυκοφάντης, ἐκ Κελτῶν ἤγγειλεν ὅσον οὔπω τὸν Σιλουανὸν αὐτῷ πολέμιον\r\nἀναφανεῖσθαι, δείσας παντάπασι καὶ φοβηθεὶς αὐτίκα ἐπ᾽ ἐμὲ πέμπει, καὶ\r\nμικρὸν εἰς τὴν Ἑλλάδα κελεύσας ὑποχωρῆσαι [274] πάλιν ἐκεῖθεν ἀκάλει παρ᾽\r\nἑαυτόν, οὔπω πρότερον τεθεαμένος πλὴν ἅπαξ μὲν ἐν Καππαδοκίᾳ, ἅπαξ δὲ ἐν\r\nἸταλίᾳ, ἀγωνισαμένης Εὐσεβίας, ὡς ἂν ὑπὲρ τῆς σωτηρίας τῆς ἐμαυτοῦ\r\nθαρρήσαιμι. καίτοι τὴν αὐτὴν αὐτῷ πόλιν ἓξ ᾤκησα μηνῶν, καὶ μέντοι καὶ\r\nὑπέσχετό με θεάσεσθαι πάλιν. ἀλλ᾽ ὁ θεοῖς ἐχθρὸς ἀνδρόγυνος, ὁ πιστὸς\r\nαὐτοῦ κατακοιμιστής, ἔλαθέ μου καὶ ἄκων εὐεργέτης γενόμενος· οὐ γὰρ εἴασεν\r\nἐντυχεῖν με πολλάκις αὐτῷ, [B] τυχὸν μὲν οὐδὲ ἐθέλοντι, πλὴν ἀλλὰ τὸ\r\nκεφάλαιον ἐκεῖνος ἦν· ὤκνει γὰρ ὡς ἂν μή τινος συνηθείας ἐγγενομένης ἡμῖν\r\nπρὸς ἀλλήλους ἔπειτα ἀγαπηθείην καὶ πιστὸς ἀναφανεὶς ἐπιτραπείην τι.\r\n\r\n(Now his whole behaviour to me before he granted me that august\r\ntitle(444)—though in fact what he did was to impose on me the most galling\r\nand irksome slavery—you have heard, if not every detail, still the greater\r\npart. As I was saying, I was on my way to my home and was barely getting\r\naway safely, beyond my hopes, when a certain sycophant(445) turned up near\r\nSirmium(446) and fabricated the rumour against certain persons there that\r\nthey were planning a revolt. You certainly know by hearsay Africanus(447)\r\nand Marinus: nor can you fail to have heard of Felix and what was the fate\r\nof those men. And when Constantius was informed of the matter, and\r\nDynamius another sycophant suddenly reported from Gaul that Silvanus(448)\r\nwas on the point of declaring himself his open enemy, in the utmost alarm\r\nand terror he forthwith sent to me, and first he bade me retire for a\r\nshort time to Greece, then summoned me from there to the court(449) again.\r\nHe had never seen me before except once in Cappadocia and once in\r\nItaly,—an interview which Eusebia had secured by her exertions so that I\r\nmight feel confidence about my personal safety. And yet I lived for six\r\nmonths in the same city(450) as he did, and he had promised that he would\r\nsee me again. But that execrable eunuch,(451) his trusty chamberlain,\r\nunconsciously and involuntarily proved himself my benefactor. For he did\r\nnot allow me to meet the Emperor often, nor perhaps did the latter desire\r\nit; still the eunuch was the chief reason. For what he dreaded was that if\r\nwe had any intercourse with one another I might be taken into favour, and\r\nwhen my loyalty became evident I might be given some place of trust.)\r\n\r\nΠαραγενόμενον δή με τότε πρῶτον ἀπὸ τῆς Ἑλλάδος αὐτίκα διὰ τῶν περὶ τὴν\r\nθεραπείαν εὐνούχων ἡ μακαρῖτις Εὐσεβία καὶ λίαν ἐφιλοφρονεῖτο. μικρὸν δὲ\r\nὕστερον ἐπελθόντος τούτου· [C] καὶ γάρ τοι καὶ τὰ περὶ Σιλουανὸν\r\nἐπέπρακτο· λοιπὸν εἴσοδός τε εἰς τὴν αὐλὴν δίδοται, καὶ τὸ λεγόμενον ἡ\r\nΘετταλικὴ περιβάλλεται πειθανάγκη. ἀρνουμένου γάρ μου τὴν συνουσίαν\r\nστερεῶς ἐν τοῖς βασιλείοις, οἱ μὲν ὥσπερ ἐν κουρείῳ συνελθόντες\r\nἀποκείρουσι τὸν πώγωνα, χλανίδα δὲ ἀμφιεννύουσι καὶ σχηματώζουσιν, ὡς τότε\r\nὑπελάμβανον, πάνυ γελοῖον στρατιώτην· [D] οὐδὲν γάρ μοι τοῦ καλλωπισμοῦ\r\nτῶν καθαρμάτων ἥρμοζεν· ἐβάδιζον δὲ οὐχ ὥσπερ ἐκεῖνοι περιβλέπων καὶ\r\nσοβῶν(452) ἀλλ᾽ εἰς γῆν βλέπων, ὥσπερ εἰθίσμην ὑπὸ τοῦ θρέψαντός με\r\nπαιδαγωγοῦ. τότε μὲν οὖν αὐτοῖς παρέσχον γέλωτα, μικρὸν δὲ ὕστερον\r\nὑποψίαν, εἶτα ἀνέλαμψεν ὁ τοσοῦτος φθόνος.\r\n\r\n(Now from the first moment of my arrival from Greece, Eusebia of blessed\r\nmemory kept showing me the utmost kindness through the eunuchs of her\r\nhousehold. And a little later when the Emperor returned—for the affair of\r\nSilvanus had been concluded—at last I was given access to the court, and,\r\nin the words of the proverb, Thessalian persuasion(453) was applied to me.\r\nFor when I firmly declined all intercourse with the palace, some of them,\r\nas though they had come together in a barber’s shop, cut off my beard and\r\ndressed me in a military cloak and transformed me into a highly ridiculous\r\nsoldier, as they thought at the time. For none of the decorations of those\r\nvillains suited me. And I walked not like them, staring about me and\r\nstrutting along, but gazing on the ground as I had been trained to do by\r\nthe preceptor(454) who brought me up. At the time then, I inspired their\r\nridicule, but a little later their suspicion, and then their jealousy was\r\ninflamed to the utmost.)\r\n\r\nἈλλ᾽ ἐνταῦθα χρὴ μὴ παραλείπειν ἐκεῖνα, πῶς ἐγὼ συνεχώρησα, πῶς\r\nἐδεχόμην(455) ὁμωρόφιος(456) ἐκείνοις γενέσθαι, οὓς ἠπιστάμην παντὶ μέν\r\nμου λυμηναμένους τῷ γένει, [275] ὑπώπτευον δὲ οὐκ εἰς μακρὰν\r\nἐπιβουλεύσοντας καὶ ἐμοὶ. πηγὰς μὲν οὖν ὁπόσας ἀφῆκα δακρύων καὶ θρήνους\r\nοἵους, ἀνατείνων εἰς τὴν ἀκρόπολιν τὴν παρ᾽ ὑμῖν τὰς χεῖρας, ὅτε\r\nἐκαλούμην, καὶ τὴν Ἀθηνᾶν ἱκετεύων σώζειν τὸν ἱκέτην καὶ μὴ ἐκδιδόναι,\r\nπολλοὶ τῶν παρ᾽ ὑμῖν ἑορακότες εἰσί μοι μάρτυρες, αὐτὴ δὲ ἡ θεὸς πρὸ τῶν\r\nἄλλων, ὅτι καὶ θάνατον ᾐτησάμην παρ᾽ [B] αὐτῆς Ἀθήνησι πρὸ τῆς τότε ὁδοῦ.\r\nὡς μὲν οὖν οὐ προύδωκεν ἡ θεὸς τὸν ἱκέτην οὐδὲ ἐξέδωκεν, ἔργοις\r\nἔδείξεν·(457) ἡγήσατο γὰρ ἁπανταχοῦ μοι καὶ παρέστησεν ἁπανταχόθεν τοὺς\r\nφύλακας, ἐξ Ἡλίου καὶ Σελήνης ἀγγέλους λαβοῦσα.\r\n\r\n(But this I must not omit to tell here, how I submitted and how I\r\nconsented to dwell under the same roof with those whom I knew to have\r\nruined my whole family, and who, I suspected, would before long plot\r\nagainst myself also. But what floods of tears I shed and what laments I\r\nuttered when I was summoned, stretching out my hands to your Acropolis and\r\nimploring Athene to save her suppliant and not to abandon me, many of you\r\nwho were eyewitnesses can attest, and the goddess herself, above all\r\nothers, is my witness that I even begged for death at her hands there in\r\nAthens rather than my journey to the Emperor. That the goddess accordingly\r\ndid not betray her suppliant or abandon him she proved by the event. For\r\neverywhere she was my guide, and on all sides she set a watch near me,\r\nbringing guardian angels from Helios and Selene.)\r\n\r\nΣυνέβη δέ τι καὶ τοιοῦτον. ἐλθὼν ἐς τὸ Μεδιόλανον ᾤκουν ἔν τινι προαστείῳ.\r\nἐνταῦθα ἔπεμπεν Εὐσεβία πολλάκις πρός με φιλοφρονουμένη καὶ γράφειν\r\nκελεύουσα καὶ θαρρεῖν, ὑπὲρ ὅτου ἂν δέωμαι.

When I came to Milan I resided in\r\none of the suburbs. Thither Eusebia sent me on several occasions messages\r\nof good‐will, and urged me to write to her without hesitation about\r\nanything that I desired. Accordingly I wrote her a letter, or rather a\r\npetition containing vows like these: “May you have children to succeed\r\nyou; may God grant you this and that, if only you send me home as quickly\r\nas possible!” But I suspected that it was not safe to send to the palace\r\nletters addressed to the Emperor’s wife. Therefore I besought the gods to\r\ninform me at night whether I ought to send the letter to the Empress. And\r\nthey warned me that if I sent it I should meet the most ignominious death.\r\nI call all the gods to witness that what I write here is true. For this\r\nreason, therefore, I forbore to send the letter. But from that night there\r\nkept occurring to me an argument which it is perhaps worth your while also\r\nto hear. “Now,” I said to myself, “I am planning to oppose the gods, and I\r\nhave imagined that I can devise wiser schemes for myself than those who\r\nknow all things. And yet human wisdom, which looks only to the present\r\nmoment, may be thankful if, with all its efforts, it succeed in avoiding\r\nmistakes even for a short space. That is why no man takes thought for\r\nthings that are to happen thirty years hence, or for things that are\r\nalready past, for the one is superfluous, the other impossible, but only\r\nfor what lies near at hand and has already some beginnings and germs. But\r\nthe wisdom of the gods sees very far, or rather, sees the whole, and\r\ntherefore it directs aright and brings to pass what is best. For they are\r\nthe causes of all that now is, and so likewise of all that is to be.\r\nWherefore it is reasonable that they should have knowledge about the\r\npresent.” So far, then, it seemed to me that on this reasoning my second\r\ndetermination was wiser than my first. And viewing the matter in the light\r\nof justice, I immediately reflected: “Would you not be provoked if one of\r\nyour own beasts were to deprive you of its services,(460) or were even to\r\nrun away when you called it, a horse, or sheep, or calf, as the case might\r\nbe? And will you, who pretended to be a man, and not even a man of the\r\ncommon herd or from the dregs of the people, but one belonging to the\r\nsuperior and reasonable class, deprive the gods of your service, and not\r\ntrust yourself to them to dispose of you as they please? Beware lest you\r\nnot only fall into great folly, but also neglect your proper duties\r\ntowards the gods. Where is your courage, and of what sort is it? A sorry\r\nthing it seems. At any rate, you are ready to cringe and flatter from fear\r\nof death, and yet it is in your power to lay all that aside and leave it\r\nto the gods to work their will, dividing with them the care of yourself,\r\nas Socrates, for instance, chose to do: and you might, while doing such\r\nthings as best you can, commit the whole to their charge; seek to possess\r\nnothing, seize nothing, but accept simply what is vouchsafed to you by\r\nthem.” And this course I thought was not only safe but becoming to a\r\nreasonable man, since the response of the gods had suggested it. For to\r\nrush headlong into unseemly and foreseen danger while trying to avoid\r\nfuture plots seemed to me a topsy‐turvy procedure. Accordingly I consented\r\nto yield. And immediately I was invested with the title and robe of\r\nCaesar.(461) The slavery that ensued and the fear for my very life that\r\nhung over me every day, Heracles, how great it was, and how terrible! My\r\ndoors locked, warders to guard them, the hands of my servants searched\r\nlest one of them should convey to me the most trifling letter from my\r\nfriends, strange servants to wait on me! Only with difficulty was I able\r\nto bring with me to court four of my own domestics for my personal\r\nservice, two of them mere boys and two older men, of whom only one knew of\r\nmy attitude to the gods, and, as far as he was able, secretly joined me in\r\ntheir worship. I had entrusted with the care of my books, since he was the\r\nonly one with me of many loyal comrades and friends, a certain\r\nphysician(462) who had been allowed to leave home with me because it was\r\nnot known that he was my friend. And this state of things caused me such\r\nalarm and I was so apprehensive about it, that though many of my friends\r\nreally wished to visit me, I very reluctantly refused them admittance; for\r\nthough I was most anxious to see them, I shrank from bringing disaster\r\nupon them and myself at the same time. But this is somewhat foreign to my\r\nnarrative. The following relates to the actual course of events.)\r\n\r\nΤριακοσίους ἑξήκοντά μοι δοὺς στρατιώτας εἰς τὸ τῶν Κελτῶν ἔθνος\r\nἀνατετραμμένον ἔστειλε, μεσοῦντος ἤδη τοῦ χειμῶνος, οὐκ ἄρχοντα μᾶλλον τῶν\r\nἐκεῖσε στρατοπέδων ἢ τοῖς ἐκεῖσε στρατηγοῖς ὑπακούοντα.(463) ἐγέγραπτο γὰρ\r\nαὐτοῖς καὶ ἐνετέταλτο διαρρήδην οὐ τοὺς πολεμίους μᾶλλον ἢ ἐμὲ\r\nπαραφυλάττειν, ὡς ἂν μὴ νεώτερόν τι πράξαιμι. τούτων δὲ ὃν ἔφην τρόπον\r\nγενομένων, περὶ τὰς τροπὰς τὰς θερινὰς [278] ἐπιτρέπει μοι βαδίζειν εἰς τὰ\r\nστρατόπεδα τὸ σχῆμα καὶ τὴν εἰκόνα περιοίσοντι τὴν ἑαυτοῦ· καὶ γάρ τοι καὶ\r\nτοῦτο εἴρητο καὶ ἐγέγραπτο, ὅτι τοῖς Γάλλοις οὐ βασιλέα δίδωσιν, ἀλλὰ τὸν\r\nτὴν ἑαυτοῦ πρὸς ἐκείνους εἰκόνα κομιοῦντα.\r\n\r\n(Constantius gave me three hundred and sixty soldiers, and in the middle\r\nof the winter(464) despatched me into Gaul, which was then in a state of\r\ngreat disorder; and I was sent not as commander of the garrisons there but\r\nrather as a subordinate of the generals there stationed. For letters had\r\nbeen sent them and express orders given that they were to watch me as\r\nvigilantly as they did the enemy, for far I should attempt to cause a\r\nrevolt. And when all this had happened in the manner I have described,\r\nabout the summer solstice he allowed me to join the army and to carry\r\nabout with me his dress and image. And indeed he had both said and written\r\nthat he was not giving the Gauls a king but one who should convey to them\r\nhis image.)\r\n\r\nΟὐ κακῶς δέ, ὡς ἀκηκόατε, τοῦ πρώτου στρατηγηθέντος ἐνιαυτοῦ καὶ\r\nπραχθέντος σπουδαίου, πρὸς τὰ χειμάδια [B] πάλιν ἐπανελθὼν εἰς τὸν ἔσχατον\r\nκατέστην κίνδυνον. οὔτε γὰρ ἀθροίζειν ἐξῆν μοι στρατόπεδον· ἕτερος γὰρ ἦν\r\nὁ τούτου κύριος· αὐτός τε ξὺν ὀλίγοις ἀποκεκλεισμένος, εἶτα παρὰ τῶν\r\nπλησίον πόλεων αἰτηθεὶς ἐπικουρίαν, ὧν εἶχον τὸ πλεῖστον ἐκείνοις δούς,\r\nαὐτὸς(465) ἀπελείφθην μόνος. ἐκεῖνα μὲν οὖν οὕτως ἐπράχθη τότε. ὡς δὲ καὶ\r\nὁ τῶν στρατοπέδων ἄρχων ἐν ὑποψίᾳ γενόμενος αὐτῷ παρῃρέθη καὶ ἀπηλλάγη τῆς\r\nἀρχῆς, [C] οὐ σφόδρα ἐπιτήδειος δόξας, ἔγωγε ἐνομίσθην ἥκιστα σπουδαῖος\r\nκαὶ δεινὸς στρατηγός, ἅτε πρᾷον ἐμαυτὸν παρασχὼν καὶ μέτριον. οὐ γὰρ ᾤμην\r\nδεῖν ζυγομαχεῖν οὐδὲ παραστρατηγεῖν, εἰ μή πού τι τῶν λίαν ἐπικινδένων\r\nἑώρων ἢ δέον γενέσθαι παρορώμενον ἢ καὶ τὴν ἀρχὴν μὴ δέον γενέσθαι\r\nγιγνόμενον. ἅπαξ δὲ καὶ δεύτερον οὐ καθηκόντως μοί τινων χρησαμένων, [D]\r\nἐμαυτὸν ᾠήθην χρῆναι τιμᾶν τῇ σιωπῇ, καὶ τοῦ λοιποῦ τὴν χλανίδα περιέφερον\r\nκαὶ τὴν εἰκόνα· τούτων γὰρ τὸ τηνικαῦτα διενοούμην ἀποπεφάνθαι κύριος.\r\n\r\n(Now when, as you have heard, the first campaign was ended that year and\r\ngreat advantage gained, I returned to winter quarters,(466) and there I\r\nwas exposed to the utmost danger. For I was not even allowed to assemble\r\nthe troops; this power was entrusted to another, while I was quartered\r\napart with only a few soldiers, and then, since the neighbouring towns\r\nbegged for my assistance, I assigned to them the greater part of the force\r\nthat I had, and so I myself was left isolated. This then was the condition\r\nof affairs at that time. And when the commander‐in‐chief(467) of the\r\nforces fell under the suspicions of Constantius and was deprived by him of\r\nhis command and superseded, I in my turn was thought to be by no means\r\ncapable or talented as a general, merely because I had shown myself mild\r\nand moderate. For I thought I ought not to fight against my yoke or\r\ninterfere with the general in command except when in some very dangerous\r\nundertaking I saw either that something was being overlooked, or that\r\nsomething was being attempted that ought never to have been attempted at\r\nall. But after certain persons had treated me with disrespect on one or\r\ntwo occasions, I decided that for the future I ought to show my own self‐\r\nrespect by keeping silence, and henceforth I contented myself with\r\nparading the imperial robe and the image. For I thought that to these at\r\nany rate I had been given a right.)\r\n\r\nἘξ ὧν ὁ Κωνστάντιος νομίσας ὀλίγον(468) μὲν ἐπιδώσειν, οὐκ εἰς τοσοῦτον δὲ\r\nμεταβολῆς ἥξειν τὰ τῶν Κελτῶν πράγματα, δίδωσί μοι τῶν στρατοπέδων τὴν\r\nἡγεμονίαν ἦρος ἀρχῇ. καὶ στρατεύω μὲν ἀκμάζοντος τοῦ σίτου, πολλῶν πάνυ\r\nΓερμανῶν [279] περὶ τὰς πεπορθημένας ἐν Κελτοῖς πόλεις ἀδεῶς κατοικούντων.\r\nτὸ μὲν οὖν πλῆθος τῶν πόλεων πέντε που καὶ τεσσαράκοντά ἐστι, τείχη τὰ\r\nδιηρπασμένα δίχα τῶν πύργων καὶ τῶν ἐλασσόνων φρουρίων. ἧς δ᾽ ἐνέμοντο γῆς\r\nἐπὶ τάδε τοῦ Ῥήνου πάσης οἱ βάρβαροι τὸ μέγεθος ὁπόσον ἀπὸ τῶν πηγῶν αὐτῶν\r\nἀρχόμενος ἄχρι τοῦ Ὠκεανοῦ περιλαμβάνει· τριακόσια δὲ ἀπεῖχον τῆς ᾐόνος\r\nτοῦ Ῥήνου στάδια οἱ πρὸς ἡμᾶς οἰκοῦντες ἔσχατοι, τριπλάσιον δὲ ἦν ἔτι\r\nτούτου πλάτος τὸ καταλειφθὲν ἔρημον [B] ὑπὸ τῆς λεηλασίας, ἔνθα οὐδὲ\r\nνέμειν ἐξῆν τοῖς Κελτοῖς τὰ βοσκήματα, καὶ πόλεις τινὲς ἔρημοι τῶν\r\nἐνοικούντων, αἷς οὔπω παρῴκουν οἱ βάρβαροι. ἐν τούτοις οὖσαν καταλαβὼν ἐγὼ\r\nτὴν Γαλατίαν πόλιν τε ἀνέλαβον τὴν Ἀγριππίναν ἐπὶ τῇ Ῥήνῳ, πρὸ μηνῶν\r\nἑαλωκυῖάν που δέκα, καὶ τεῖχος Ἀργέντορα πλησίον πρὸς ταῖς ὑπωρείαις αὐτοῦ\r\nτοῦ Βοσέγου, καὶ ἐμαχεσάμην οὐκ ἀκλεῶς.

And when the grain was ripe I took the field; for a great\r\nnumber of Germans had settled themselves with impunity near the towns they\r\nhad sacked in Gaul. Now the number of the towns whose walls had been\r\ndismantled was about forty‐five, without counting citadels and smaller\r\nforts. And the barbarians then controlled on our side of the Rhine the\r\nwhole country that extends from its sources to the Ocean. Moreover those\r\nwho were settled nearest to us were as much as three hundred stades from\r\nthe banks of the Rhine, and a district three times as wide as that had\r\nbeen left a desert by their raids; so that the Gauls could not even\r\npasture their cattle there. Then too there were certain cities deserted by\r\ntheir inhabitants, near which the barbarians were not yet encamped. This\r\nthen was the condition of Gaul when I took it over. I recovered the city\r\nof Agrippina(470) on the Rhine which had been taken about ten months\r\nearlier, and also the neighbouring fort of Argentoratum,(471) near the\r\nfoot‐hills of the Vosges mountains, and there I engaged the enemy not\r\ningloriously. It may be that the fame of that battle has reached even your\r\nears. There though the gods gave into my hands as prisoner of war the\r\nking(472) of the enemy, I did not begrudge Constantius the glory of that\r\nsuccess. And yet though I was not allowed to triumph for it, I had it in\r\nmy power to slay my enemy, and moreover I could have led him through the\r\nwhole of Gaul and exhibited him to the cities, and thus have luxuriated as\r\nit were in the misfortunes of Chnodomar. I thought it my duty to do none\r\nof these things, but sent him at once to Constantius who was returning\r\nfrom the country of the Quadi and the Sarmatians. So it came about that,\r\nthough I had done all the fighting and he had only travelled in those\r\nparts and held friendly intercourse with the tribes who dwell on the\r\nborders of the Danube, it was not I but he who triumphed.)\r\n\r\nΤὸ δὴ μετὰ τοῦτο δεύτερος ἐνιαυτὸς καὶ πρίτος, καὶ πάντες μὲν ἀπελήλαντο\r\nτῆς Γαλατίας οἱ βάρβαροι, πλεῖσται δὲ ἀνελήφθησαν τῶν πόλεων, παμπληθεῖς\r\nδὲ ἀπὸ τῆς Βρεττανίδος ναῦς ἀνήχθησαν. ἑξακοσίων νηῶν ἀνήγαγον στόλον,\r\n[280] ὧν τὰς τετρακοσίας ἐν οὐδὲ ὅλοις μησὶ δέκα ναυπηγησάμενος πάσας\r\nεἰσήγαγον εἰς τὸν Ῥῆνον, ἔργον οὐ μικρὸν διὰ τοὺς ἐπικειμένους καὶ\r\nπαροικοῦντας πλησίον βαρβάρους. ὁ γοῦν Φλωρέντιος οὕτως ᾤετο τοῦτο\r\nἀδύνατον, ὥστε ἀργύρου δισχιλίας λίτρας ὑπέσχετο μισθὸν ἀποτίσειν τοῖς\r\nβαρβάροις ὑπὲρ τῆς παρόδου, καὶ ὁ Κωνστάντιος ὑπὲρ τούτου μαθών·\r\nἐκοινώσατο γὰρ αὐτῷ περὶ τῆς δόσεως· [B] ἐπέστειλε πρός με τὸ αὐτὸ\r\nπράττειν(473) κελεύσας, εἰ μὴ παντάπασιν αἰσχρόν μοι φανείη. πῶς δὲ οὐκ ἦν\r\nαἰσχρόν, ὅπου Κωνσταντίῳ τοιοῦτον ἐφάνη, λίαν εἰωθότι θεραπεύειν τοὺς\r\nβαρβάρους; ἐδόθη μὴν αὐτοῖς οὐδέν· ἀλλ᾽ ἐπ᾽ αὐτοὺς στρατεύσας, ἀμυνόντων\r\nμοι καὶ παρεστώτων τῶν θεῶν, ὑπεδεξάμην μὲν μοῖραν τοῦ Σαλίων ἔθνους,\r\nΧαμάβους δὲ ἐξήλασα, πολλὰς βοῦς καὶ γύναια μετὰ παιδαρίων συλλαβών. οὕτω\r\nδὲ πάντας ἐφόβησα καὶ παρεσκεύασα καταπτῆξαι τὴν ἐμὴν ἔφοδον, [C] ὥστε\r\nπαραχρῆμα λαβεῖν ὁμήρους καὶ τῇ σιτοπομπίᾳ παρασχεῖν ἀσφαλῆ κομιδήν.\r\n\r\n(Then followed the second and third years of that campaign, and by that\r\ntime all the barbarians had been driven out of Gaul, most of the towns had\r\nbeen recovered, and a whole fleet of many ships had arrived from Britain.\r\nI had collected a fleet of six hundred ships, four hundred of which I had\r\nhad built in less than ten months, and I brought them all into the Rhine,\r\nno slight achievement, on account of the neighbouring barbarians who kept\r\nattacking me. At least it seemed so impossible to Florentius that he had\r\npromised to pay the barbarians a fee of two thousand pounds weight of\r\nsilver in return for a passage. Constantius when he learned this—for\r\nFlorentius had informed him about the proposed payment—wrote to me to\r\ncarry out the agreement, unless I thought it absolutely disgraceful. But\r\nhow could it fail to be disgraceful when it seemed so even to Constantius,\r\nwho was only too much in the habit of trying to conciliate the barbarians?\r\nHowever, no payment was made to them. Instead I marched against them, and\r\nsince the gods protected me and were present to aid, I received the\r\nsubmission of part of the Salian tribe, and drove out the Chamavi and took\r\nmany cattle and women and children. And I so terrified them all, and made\r\nthem tremble at my approach that I immediately received hostages from them\r\nand secured a safe passage for my food supplies.)\r\n\r\nΜακρόν ἐστι πάντα ἀπαριθμεῖσθαι καὶ τὰ καθ᾽ ἕκαστον γράφειν, ὅσα ἐν\r\nἐνιαυτοῖς ἔπραξα τέτταρσι· τὰ κεφάλαια δέ· τρίτον ἐπεραιώθην καῖσαρ ἔτι\r\nτὸν Ῥῆνον· δισμυρίους ἀπῄτησα παρὰ τῶν βαρβάρων ὑπὲρ τὸν Ῥῆνον ὄντας\r\nαἰχμαλώτους· ἐκ δυοῖν ἀγώνοιν καὶ μιᾶς πολιορκίας χιλίους ἐξελὼν ἐζώγρησα,\r\nοὐ τὴν ἄχρηστον ἡλικίαν, ἄνδρας δὲ ἡβῶντας· [D] ἔπεμψα τῷ Κωνσταντίῳ\r\nτέτταρας ἀριθμοὺς τῶν κρατίστων πεζῶν, τρεῖς ἄλλους τῶν ἐλαττόνων, ἱππέων\r\nτάγματα δύο τὰ ἐντιμότατα· πόλεις ἀνέλαβον νῦν μὲν δὴ τῶν θεῶν ἐθελόντων\r\nπάσας, τότε δὲ ἀνειλήφειν ἐλάττους ὀλίγῳ τῶν τεσσαράκοντα. μάρτυρας καλῶ\r\nτὸν Δία καὶ πάντας θεοὺς πολιούχους τε καὶ ὁμογνίους ὑπὲρ τῆς ἐμῆς\r\nπροαιρέσεως εἰς αὐτὸν καὶ πίστεως, ὅτι τοιοῦτος γέγονα περὶ αὐτόν, οἷον ἂν\r\nεἱλόμην ἐγὼ υἱὸν περὶ ἐμὲ γενέσθαι.

But to sum it\r\nall up: Three times, while I was still Caesar, I crossed the Rhine; one\r\nthousand persons who were held as captives on the further side of the\r\nRhine I demanded and received back; in two battles and one siege I took\r\ncaptive ten thousand prisoners, and those not of unserviceable age but men\r\nin the prime of life; I sent to Constantius four levies of excellent\r\ninfantry, three more of infantry not so good, and two very distinguished\r\nsquadrons of cavalry. I have now with the help of the gods recovered all\r\nthe towns, and by that time I had already recovered almost forty. I call\r\nZeus and all the gods who protect cities and our race to bear witness as\r\nto my behaviour towards Constantius and my loyalty to him, and that I\r\nbehaved to him as I would have chosen that my own son should behave to\r\nme.(475) I have paid him more honour than any Caesar has paid to any\r\nEmperor in the past. Indeed, to this very day he has no accusation to\r\nbring against me on that score, though I have been entirely frank in my\r\ndealings with him, but he invents absurd pretexts for his resentment. He\r\nsays, “You have detained Lupicinus and three other men.” And supposing I\r\nhad even put them to death after they had openly plotted against me, he\r\nought for the sake of keeping peace to have renounced his resentment at\r\ntheir fate. But I did those men not the least injury, and I detained them\r\nbecause they are by nature quarrelsome and mischief‐makers. And though I\r\nam spending large sums of the public money on them, I have robbed them of\r\nnone of their property. Observe how Constantius really lays down the law\r\nthat I ought to proceed to extremities with such men! For by his anger on\r\nbehalf of men who are not related to him at all, does he not rebuke and\r\nridicule me for my folly in having served so faithfully the murderer of my\r\nfather, my brothers, my cousins; the executioner as it were of his and my\r\nwhole family and kindred? Consider too with what deference I have\r\ncontinued to treat him even since I became Emperor, as is shown in my\r\nletters.)\r\n\r\nΚαὶ τὰ πρὸ τούτου δὲ ὁποῖός τις γέγονα περὶ αὐτὸν ἐντεῦθεν εἴσεσθε.\r\nαἰσθόμενος, ὅτι τῶν ἁμαρτανομένων κληρονομήσω μὲν αὐτὸς τὴν ἀδοξίαν καὶ\r\nτὸν κίνδυνον, ἐξεργασθήσεται δὲ ἑτέροις τὰ πλεῖστα, [D] πρῶτον μὲν\r\nἱκέτευον, εἰ ταῦτα πράττειν αὐτῷ φαίνοιτο καὶ πάντως ἐμὲ προσαγορεύειν\r\nκαίσαρα δεδογμένον εἴη, ἄνδρας ἀγαθοὺς καὶ σπουδαίους δοῦναί μοι τοὺς\r\nὑπουργοῦντας· ὁ δὲ πρότερον ἔδωκε τοὺς μοχθηροτάτους. ὡς δὲ ὁ μὲν εἷς ὁ\r\nπονηρότατος καὶ μάλα ἄσμενος(476) ὑπήκουσεν, οὐδεὶς δὲ ἠξίου τῶν ἄλλων,\r\nἄνδρα δίδωσιν ἄκων ἐμοὶ καὶ μάλα ἀγαθὸν Σαλούστιον, ὃς διὰ τὴν ἀρετὴν\r\nεὐθέως αὐτῷ γέγονεν ὕποπτος. οὐκ ἀρκεσθεὶς ἐγὼ τῷ τοιούτῳ, βλέπων δὲ πρὸς\r\nτὸ διάφορον τοῦ τρόπου καὶ κατανόησας(477) τῷ μὲν ἄγαν αὐτὸν πιστεύοντα,\r\n[282] τῷ δὲ οὐδ᾽ ὅλως προσέχοντα, τῆς δεξιᾶς αὐτοῦ καὶ τῶν γονάτων\r\nἁψάμενος· Τούτων, ἔφην, οὐδείς ἐστί μοι συνήθης οὐδὲ γέγονεν ἔμπροσθεν·\r\nἐπιστάμενος δὲ αὐτοὺς ἐκ φήμης, σοῦ κελεύσαντος, ἑταίρους ἐμαυτοῦ καὶ\r\nφίλους νομίζω, τοῖς πάλαι γνωρίμοις ἐπ᾽ ἴσης τιμῶν. οῦ μὴν δίκαιον ἢ\r\nτούτοις ἐπιτετράφθαι τὰ ἐμὰ ἢ τὰ τούτων ἡμῖν συγκινδυνεῦσαι. τί οὖν\r\nἱκετεύω; γραπτοὺς ἡμῖν δὸς ὥσπερ νόμους, [B] τίμων ἀπέχεσθαι χρὴ καὶ ὅσα\r\nπράττειν ἐπιτρέπεις. δῆλον γάρ, ὅτι τὸν μὲν πειθόμενον ἐπαινέσεις, τὸν δὲ\r\nἀπειθοῦντα κολάσεις, εἰ καὶ ὅ, τι μάλιστα νομίζω μηδένα ἀπειθήσειν.\r\n\r\n(And how I behaved to him before that you shall now learn. Since I was\r\nwell aware that whenever mistakes were made I alone should incur the\r\ndisgrace and danger, though most of the work was carried on by others, I\r\nfirst of all implored him, if he had made up his mind to that course and\r\nwas altogether determined to proclaim me Caesar, to give me good and able\r\nmen to assist me. He however at first gave me the vilest wretches. And\r\nwhen one, the most worthless of them, had very gladly accepted and no one\r\nof the others consented, he gave me with a bad grace an officer who was\r\nindeed excellent, Sallust, who on account of his virtue has at once fallen\r\nunder his suspicion. And since I was not satisfied with such an\r\narrangement and saw how his manner to them varied, for I observed that he\r\ntrusted one of them too much and paid no attention at all to the other, I\r\nclasped his right hand and his knees and said: “I have no acquaintance\r\nwith any of these men nor have had in the past. But I know them by report,\r\nand since you bid me I regard them as my comrades and friends and pay them\r\nas much respect as I would to old acquaintances. Nevertheless it is not\r\njust that my affairs should be entrusted to them or that their fortunes\r\nshould be hazarded with mine. What then is my petition? Give me some sort\r\nof written rules as to what I must avoid and what you entrust to me to\r\nperform. For it is clear that you will approve of him who obeys you and\r\npunish him who is disobedient, though indeed I am very sure that no one\r\nwill disobey you.”)\r\n\r\nὍσα μὲν οὖν ἐπεχείρησεν ὁ Πεντάδιος αὐτίκα καινοτομεῖν, οὐδὲν χρὴ λέγειν·\r\nἀντέπραττον δὲ ἐγὼ πρὸς πάντα, καὶ γίνεταί μοι δυσμενὴς ἐκεῖθεν. εἶτ᾽\r\nἄλλον λαβὼν καὶ παρασκευάσας δεύτερον καὶ τρίτον, Παῦλον, [C] Γαυδέντιον,\r\nτοὺς ὀνομαστοὺς ἐπ᾽ ἑμὲ μισθωσάμενος συκοφάντας, Σαλούστιον μὲν ὡς ἐμοὶ\r\nφίλον ἀποστῆναι παρασκευάζει, Λουκιλιανὸν δὲ δοθῆναι διάδοχον αὐτίκα. καὶ\r\nμικρὸν ὕστερον καὶ Φλωρέντιος ἦν ἐχθρὸς ἐμοὶ διὰ τὰς πλεονεξίας, αἷς\r\nἠναντιούμην. πείθουσιν οὗτοι τὸν Κωνστάντιον ἀφελέσθαι με τῶν στρατοπέδων\r\nἁπάντων, ἴσως τι καὶ ὑπὸ τῆς ζηλοτυπίας τῶν κατορθωμάτων κνιζόμενον, [D]\r\nκαὶ γράφει γράμματα πολλῆς μὲν ἀτιμίας εἰς ἐμὲ πλήρη, Κελτοῖς δὲ ἀνάστασιν\r\nἀπειλοῦντα· μικροῦ γὰρ δέω φάναι τὸ στρατιωτικὸν ἅπαν ἀδιακρίτως τὸ\r\nμαχιμώτατον ἀπαγαγεῖν τῆς Γαλατίας ἐκέλευσεν, ἐπιτάξας τοῦτο τὸ ἔργον\r\nΛουππικίνῳ τε καὶ Γιντωνίῳ, ἐμοὶ δὲ ὡς ἂν πρὸς μηδὲν ἐναντιωθείην αὐτοῖς\r\nἐπέστειλεν.\r\n\r\n(Now I need not mention the innovations that Pentadius at once tried to\r\nintroduce. But I kept opposing him in everything and for that reason he\r\nbecame my enemy. Then Constantius chose another and a second and a third\r\nand fashioned them for his purpose, I mean Paul and Gaudentius, those\r\nnotorious sycophants; he hired them to attack me and then took measures to\r\nremove Sallust, because he was my friend, and to appoint Lucilianus\r\nimmediately, as his successor. And a little later Florentius also became\r\nmy enemy on account of his avarice which I used to oppose. These men\r\npersuaded Constantius, who was perhaps already somewhat irritated by\r\njealousy of my successes, to remove me altogether from command of the\r\ntroops. And he wrote letters full of insults directed against me and\r\nthreatening ruin to the Gauls. For he gave orders for the withdrawal from\r\nGaul of, I might almost say, the whole of the most efficient troops\r\nwithout exception, and assigned this commission to Lupicinus and\r\nGintonius, while to me he wrote that I must oppose them in nothing.)\r\n\r\nἘνταῦθα μέντοι τίνα τρόπον τὰ τῶν θεῶν εἴποιμ᾽ [283] ἂν ἔργα πρὸς ὑμᾶς;\r\nδιενοούμην· μάρτυρες δὲ αὐτοί· πᾶσαν ἀπορρίψας τὴν βασιλικὴν πολυτέλειαν\r\nκαὶ παρασκευὴν ἡσυχάζειν, πράττειν δὲ οὐδὲν ὅλως. ἀνέμενον δὲ Φλωρέντιον\r\nπαραγενέσθαι καὶ τὸν Λουππικῖνον· ἦν γὰρ ὁ μὲν περὶ τὴν Βίενναν, ὁ δὲ ἐν\r\nταῖς Βρεττανίαις. ἐν τούτῳ θόρυβος πολὺς [B] ἦν περὶ πάντας τοὺς ἰδιώτας\r\nκαὶ τοὺς στρατιώτας, καὶ γράφει τις ἀνώνυμον γραμματεῖον(478) εἰς τὴν\r\nἀστυγείτονά μοι πόλιν πρὸς τοὺς Πετουλάντας τουτουσὶ καὶ Κελτούς·\r\nὀνομάζεται δὲ οὕτω τὰ τάγματα· ἐν ᾧ πολλὰ μὲν ἐγέγραπτο κατ᾽ ἐκείνου,\r\nπολλοὶ δὲ ὑπὲρ τῆς Γαλλιῶν προδοσίας ὀδυρμοί· καὶ μέντοι καὶ τὴν ἐμὴν\r\nἀτιμίαν ὁ τὸ γραμματεῖον συγγράψας ἀπωδύρετο. τοῦτο κομισθὲν ἐκίνησε\r\nπάντας, οἳ τὰ Κωνσταντίου μάλιστα ἐφρόνουν, [C] ἐπιθέσθαι μοι κατὰ τὸ\r\nκαρτερώτατον, ὅπως ἤδη τοὺς στρατιώτας ἐκπέμψαιμι, πρὶν καὶ εἰς τοὺς\r\nἄλλους ἀριθμοὺς ὅμοια ῥιφῆναι. καὶ γὰρ οὐδὲ ἄλλος τις παρῆν τῶν δοκούντων\r\nεὔνως ἔχειν ἐμοί, Νεβρίδιος δέ, Πεντάδιος, Δεκέντιος, ὁ παρ᾽ αὐτοῦ\r\nπεμφθεὶς ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸ τοῦτο Κωνσταντίου. λέγοντος δέ μου χρῆναι περιμένειν ἔτι\r\nΛουππικῖνον καὶ Φλωρέντιον, οὐδεὶς ἤκουσεν, ἀλλ᾽ ἔλεγον πάντες τοὐναντίον\r\nὅτι δεῖ Ποιεῖν, εἰ μὴ βούλομαι ταῖς προλαβούσαις ὑποψίαις ὥσπερ ἀπόδειξιν\r\n[D] καὶ τεκμήριον τοῦτο προσθεῖναι. εἶτα προσέθεσαν ὡς Νῦν μὲν\r\nἐκπεμφθέντων αὐτὼν σόν ἐστι τὸ ἔργον, ἀφικομένων δὲ τούτων οὐ σοὶ τοῦτο,\r\nἀλλ᾽ ἐκείνοις λογιεῖται Κωνστάντιος, σὺ δὲ ἐν αἰτίᾳ γενήσῃ. γράψαι δή(479)\r\nμε ἔπεισαν αὐτῷ, μᾶλλον δὲ ἐβιάσαντο· πείθεται μὲν γὰρ ἐκεῖνος, ᾧπερ\r\nἔξεστι καὶ μὴ πεισθῆναι, βιάζεσθαι δὲ οἷς ἂν ἐξῇ, τοῦ πείθειν οὐδὲν\r\nπροσδέονται· οὔκουν οὐδὲ οἱ βιασθέντες τῶν πεπεισμένων εἰσίν, ἀλλὰ τῶν\r\nἀναγκασθέντων. ἐσκοποῦμεν ἐνταῦθα, [284] ποίαν ὁδὸν αὐτοὺς χρὴ βαδίζειν,\r\nδιττῆς οὔσης. ἐγὼ μὲν ἠξίουν ἑτέραν τραπῆναι, οἱ δὲ αὖθις ἀναγκάζουσιν\r\nἐκείνην ἰέναι, μὴ τοῦτο αὐτὸ γενόμενον ὥσπερ ἀφορμήν τινα στάσεως τοῖς\r\nστρατιώταις παράσχῃ καὶ ταραχῆς τινος αἴτιον γένηται, εἶτα στασιάζειν ἅπαξ\r\nἀρξάμενοι πάντα ἀθρόως ταράξωσιν. ἐδόκει τὸ δέος οὐ παντάπασιν ἄλογον\r\nεἶναι τῶν ἀνθρώπων.\r\n\r\n(And now in what terms shall I describe to you the work of the gods? It\r\nwas my intention, as they will bear me witness, to divest myself of all\r\nimperial splendour and state and remain in peace, taking no part whatever\r\nin affairs. But I waited for Florentius and Lupicinus to arrive; for the\r\nformer was at Vienne, the latter in Britain. Meanwhile there was great\r\nexcitement among the civilians and the troops, and someone wrote an\r\nanonymous letter to the town near where I was,(480) addressed to the\r\nPetulantes and the Celts—those were the names of the legions—full of\r\ninvectives against Constantius and of lamentations about his betrayal of\r\nthe Gauls. Moreover the author of the letter lamented bitterly the\r\ndisgrace inflicted on myself. This letter when it arrived provoked all\r\nthose who were most definitely on the side of Constantius to urge me in\r\nthe strongest terms to send away the troops at once, before similar\r\nletters could be scattered broadcast among the rest of the legions. And\r\nindeed there was no one there belonging to the party supposed to be\r\nfriendly to me, but only Nebridius, Pentadius, and Decentius, the latter\r\nof whom had been despatched for this very purpose by Constantius. And when\r\nI replied that we ought to wait still longer for Lupicinus and Florentius,\r\nno one listened to me, but they all declared that we ought to do the very\r\nopposite, unless I wished to add this further proof and evidence for the\r\nsuspicions that were already entertained about me. And they added this\r\nargument: “If you send away the troops now it will be regarded as your\r\nmeasure, but when the others come Constantius will give them not you the\r\ncredit and you will be held to blame.” And so they persuaded or rather\r\ncompelled me to write to him. For he alone may be said to be persuaded who\r\nhas the power to refuse, but those who can use force have no need to\r\npersuade as well;(481) then again where force is used there is no\r\npersuasion, but a man is the victim of necessity. Thereupon we discussed\r\nby which road, since there were two, the troops had better march. I\r\npreferred that they should take one of these, but they immediately\r\ncompelled them to take the other, for fear that the other route if chosen\r\nshould give rise to mutiny among the troops and cause some disturbance,\r\nand that then, when they had once begun to mutiny, they might throw all\r\ninto confusion. Indeed such apprehension on their part seemed not\r\naltogether without grounds.)\r\n\r\nἮλθε τὰ τάγματα, ὑπήντησα κατὰ τὸ νενομισμένον αὐτοῖς, [B] ἔχεσθαι τῆς\r\nὁδοῦ προύτρεψα· μίαν ἡμέραν ἐπέμεινεν, ἄχρις ἧς οὐδὲν ᾔδειν ἐγὼ τῶν\r\nβεβουλευμένων αὐτοῖς· ἴστω Ζεύς, Ἥλιος, Ἄρης, Ἀθηνᾶ καὶ πάντες θεοί, ὡς\r\nοὐδὲ ἐγγὺς ἀφίκετό μού τις τοιαύτη ὑπόνοια ἄχρι δείλης αὐτῆς· ὀψίας δὲ ἤδη\r\nπερὶ ἡλίου δυσμὰς ἐμηνύθη μοι, καὶ αὐτίκα τὰ βασίλεια περιείληπτο, καὶ\r\nἐβόων πάντες, ἔτι φροντίζοντός μου τί χρὴ ποιεῖν καὶ οὔπω σφόδρα\r\nπιστεύοντος· [C] ὔτυχον γὰρ ἔτι τῆς γαμετῆς ζώσης μοι ἀναπαυσόμενος ἰδίᾳ\r\nπρὸς τὸ πλησίον ὑπερῷον ἀνελθών. εἶτα ἐκεῖθεν· ἀνεπέπτατο γὰρ ὁ τοῖχος·\r\nπροσεκύνησα τὸν Δία. γενομένης δὲ ἔτι μείζονος τῆς βοῆς καὶ θορυβουμένων\r\nπάντων ἐν τοῖς βασιλείοις, ᾐτέομεν τὸν θεὸν δοῦναι τέρας. αὐτὰρ ὅ γ᾽ ἡμῖν\r\nδεῖξε καὶ ἠνώγει πεισθῆναι καὶ μὴ προσεναντιοῦσθαι τοῦ στρατοπέδου τῇ\r\nπροθυμίᾳ. γενομένων ὅμως [D] ἐμοὶ καὶ τούτων τῶν σημείων, οὐκ εἶξα\r\nἑτοίμως, ἀλλ᾽ ἀντέσχον εἰς ὅσον ἠδυνάμην, καὶ οὔτε τὴν πρόσρησιν οὔτε τὸν\r\nστέφανον προσιέμην. ἐπεὶ δὲ οὔτε εἷς ὢν(482) πολλῶν ἠδυνάμην κρατεῖν οἵ τε\r\nτοῦτο βουλόμενοι γενέσθαι θεοὶ τοὺς μὲν παρώξυνον, ἐμοὶ δὲ ἔθελγον τὴν\r\nγνώμην, ὥρᾳ που τρίτῃ σχεδὸν οὐκ οἶδα οὗτινός μοι στρατιώτου δόντος\r\nμανιάκην περιεθέμην καὶ ἦλθον εἰς τὰ βασίλεια, ἔνδοθεν ἀπ᾽ αὐτῆς, ὡς\r\nἴσασιν οἱ θεοί, στένων τῆς καρδίας.

For one day they halted, and till\r\nthat time I knew nothing whatever of what they had determined; I call to\r\nwitness Zeus, Helios, Ares, Athene, and all the other gods that no such\r\nsuspicion even entered my mind until that very evening. It was already\r\nlate, when about sunset the news was brought to me, and suddenly the\r\npalace was surrounded and they all began to shout aloud, while I was still\r\nconsidering what I ought to do and feeling by no means confident. My wife\r\nwas still alive and it happened, that in order to rest alone, I had gone\r\nto the upper room near hers. Then from there through an opening in the\r\nwall I prayed to Zeus. And when the shouting grew still louder and all was\r\nin a tumult in the palace I entreated the god to give me a sign; and\r\nthereupon he showed me a sign(483) and bade me yield and not oppose myself\r\nto the will of the army. Nevertheless even after these tokens had been\r\nvouchsafed to me I did not yield without reluctance, but resisted as long\r\nas I could, and would not accept either the salutation(484) or the diadem.\r\nBut since I could not singlehanded control so many, and moreover the gods,\r\nwho willed that this should happen, spurred on the soldiers and gradually\r\nsoftened my resolution, somewhere about the third hour some soldier or\r\nother gave me the collar and I put it on my head and returned to the\r\npalace, as the gods know groaning in my heart. And yet surely it was my\r\nduty to feel confidence and to trust in the god after he had shown me the\r\nsign; but I was terribly ashamed and ready to sink into the earth at the\r\nthought of not seeming to obey Constantius faithfully to the last.)\r\n\r\nΠολλῆς οὖν οὔσης περὶ τὰ βασίλεια κατηφείας, τοῦτον εὐθὺς οἱ Κωνσταντίου\r\nφίλοι τὸν καιρὸν ἁρπάσαι διανοηθέντες ἐπιβουλήν μοι ῥάπτουσιν αὐτίκα καί\r\nδιένειμαν τοῖς στρατιώταις χρήματα, δυοῖν θάτερον προσδοκῶντες, ἢ\r\nδιαστήσειν ἀλλήλους ἢ [B] καὶ παντάπασιν ἐπιθήσεσθαι(485) μοι φανερῶς.\r\nαἰσθόμενός τις τῶν ἐπιτεταγμένων τῇ προόδῳ τῆς ἐμῆς γαμετῆς λάθρᾳ\r\nπραττόμενον αὐτὸ ἐμοὶ μὲν πρῶτον ἐμήνυσεν, ὡς δὲ ἑώρα με μηδὲν προσέχοντα,\r\nπαραφρονήσας ὥσπερ οἱ θεόληπτοι δημοσίᾳ βοᾶν ἤρξατο κατὰ τὴν ἀγοράν·\r\nἌνδρες στρατιῶται καὶ ξένοι καὶ πολῖται, μὴ προδῶτε τὸν αὐτοκράτορα. εἶτα\r\nἐμπίπτει θυμὸς εἰς τοὺς στρατιώτας, καὶ πάντες εἰς τὰ βασίλεια μετὰ τῶν\r\nὅπλων ἔθεον.

But when a certain officer belonging to those who commanded my\r\nwife’s escort perceived that this was being secretly contrived, he first\r\nreported it to me and then, when he saw that I paid no attention to him,\r\nhe became frantic, and like one possessed he began to cry aloud before the\r\npeople in the market‐place, “Fellow soldiers, strangers, and citizens, do\r\nnot abandon the Emperor!” Then the soldiers were inspired by a frenzy of\r\nrage and they all rushed to the palace under arms. And when they found me\r\nalive, in their delight, like men who meet friends whom they had not hoped\r\nto see again, they pressed round me on this side and on that, and embraced\r\nme and carried me on their shoulders. And it was a sight worth seeing, for\r\nthey were like men seized with a divine frenzy. Then after they had\r\nsurrounded me on all sides they demanded that I give up to them for\r\npunishment the friends of Constantius. What fierce opposition I had to\r\nfight down in my desire to save those persons is known to all the gods.)\r\n\r\nἈλλὰ δὴ τὰ μετὰ τοῦτο πῶς πρὸς τὸν Κωνστάντιον διεπραξάμην; οὔπω καὶ\r\nτήμερον ἐν ταῖς πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐπιστολαῖς τῇ δοθείσῃ μοι παρὰ τῶν θεῶν\r\nἐπωνυμίᾳ κεχρημαι, καίσαρα δὲ ἐμαυτὸν γέγραφα, καὶ πέπεικα τοὺς στρατιώτας\r\nὀμόσαι μοι μηδενὸς ἐπιθυμήσειν, εἴπερ ἡμῖν ἐπιτρέψειεν ἀδεῶς οἰκεῖν τὰς\r\nΓαλλίας, τοῖς πεπραγμένοις συναινέσας.

Even to this day\r\nI have not yet used in my letters to him the title which was bestowed on\r\nme by the gods, but I have always signed myself Caesar, and I have\r\npersuaded the soldiers to demand nothing more if only he would allow us to\r\ndwell peaceably in Gaul and would ratify what has been already done. All\r\nthe legions with me sent letters to him praying that there might be\r\nharmony between us. But instead of this he let loose against us the\r\nbarbarians, and among them proclaimed me his foe and paid them bribes so\r\nthat the people of the Gauls might be laid waste; moreover he wrote to the\r\nforces in Italy and bade them be on their guard against any who should\r\ncome from Gaul; and on the frontiers of Gaul in the cities near by he\r\nordered to be got ready three million bushels of wheat which had been\r\nground at Brigantia,(488) and the same amount near the Cottian Alps, with\r\nthe intention of marching to oppose me. These are not mere words but deeds\r\nthat speak plain. In fact the letters that he wrote I obtained from the\r\nbarbarians who brought them to me; and I seized the provisions that had\r\nbeen made ready, and the letters of Taurus. Besides, even now in his\r\nletters he addresses me as “Caesar” and declares that he will never make\r\nterms with me: but he sent one Epictetus, a bishop of Gaul,(489) to offer\r\na guarantee for my personal safety; and throughout his letters he keeps\r\nrepeating that he will not take my life, but about my honour he says not a\r\nword. As for his oaths, for my part I think they should, as the proverb\r\nsays, be written in ashes,(490) so little do they inspire belief. But my\r\nhonour I will not give up, partly out of regard for what is seemly and\r\nfitting, but also to secure the safety of my friends. And I have not yet\r\ndescribed the cruelty that he is practising over the whole earth.)\r\n\r\nΤαῦτα ἔπεισέ με, ταῦτα ἐφάνη μοι δίκαια. καὶ πρῶτον μὲν αὐτὰ τοῖς πάντα\r\nὁρῶσι καὶ ἀκούουσιν ἀνεθέμην θεοῖς. εἶτα θυσάμενος περὶ τῆς ἐξόδου καὶ\r\nγενομένων καλῶν τῶν ἱερῶν κατ᾽ αὐτὴν ἐκείνην τὴν ἡμέραν, ἐν ᾗ τοῖς\r\nστρατιώταις περὶ τῆς ἐπὶ τάδε πορείας [287] ἔμελλον διαλέγεσθαι, ὑπέρ τε\r\nτῆς ἐμαυτοῦ σωτηρίας καὶ πολὺ πλέον ὑπὲρ τῆς τῶν κοινῶν εὐπραγίας καὶ τῆς\r\nἁπάντων ἀνθρώπων ἐλευθερίας αὐτοῦ τε τοῦ Κελτῶν ἔθνους, ὃ δὶς ἤδη τοῖς\r\nπολεμίοις ἐξέδωκεν, οὐδὲ τῶν προγονικῶν φεισάμενος τάφων, ὁ τοὺς\r\nἀλλοτρίους πάνυ θεραπεύων, ᾠήθην δεῖν ἔθνη τε προσλαβεῖν τὰ δυνατώτατα καὶ\r\nχρημάτων πόρους δικαιοτάτων ἐξ ἀργυρείων καὶ χρυσείων, καὶ εἰ μὲν\r\nἀγαπήσειεν ἔτι νῦν γοῦν τὴν πρὸς ἡμᾶς ὁμόνοιαν, εἴσω τῶν νῦν ἐχομένων\r\nμένειν, [B] εἰ δὲ πολεμεῖν διανοοῖτο καὶ μηδὲν ἀπὸ τῆς προτέρας γνώμης\r\nχαλάσειεν, ὅ, τι ἂν ᾖ τοῖς θεοῖς φίλον πάσχειν ἢ πράττειν, ὡς αἴσχιον\r\nἀνανδρίᾳ ψυχῆς καὶ διανοίας ἀμαθίᾳ ἢ πλήθει δυνάμεως ἀσθενέστερον αὐτοῦ\r\nφανῆναι. νῦν μὲν γὰρ εἰ τῷ πλήθει κρατήσειεν, οὐκ ἐκείνου τὸ ἔργον, ἀλλὰ\r\nτῆς πολυχειρίας ἐστίν· εἰ δὲ ἐν ταῖς Γαλλίαις περιμένοντά με καὶ τὸ ζῆν\r\nἀγαπῶντα καὶ διακλίνοντα τὸν κίνδυνον [C] ἁπανταχόθεν περικόψας κατέλαβε,\r\nκύκλῳ μὲν ὑπὸ τῶν βαρβάρων, κατὰ στόμα δὲ ὑπὸ τῶν αὐτοῦ στρατοπέδων, τὸ\r\nπαθεῖν τε οἶμαι τὰ ἔσχατα προσῆν καὶ ἔτι ἡ τῶν πραγμάτων αἰσχύνη οὐδεμιᾶς\r\nἐλάττων ζημίας τοῖς γε σώφροσι.\r\n\r\n(These then were the events that persuaded me; this was the conduct I\r\nthought just. And first I imparted it to the gods who see and hear all\r\nthings. Then when I had offered sacrifices for my departure, the omens\r\nwere favourable on that very day on which I was about to announce to the\r\ntroops that they were to march to this place; and since it was not only on\r\nbehalf of my own safety but far more for the sake of the general welfare\r\nand the freedom of all men and in particular of the people of Gaul,—for\r\ntwice already he had betrayed them to the enemy and had not even spared\r\nthe tombs of their ancestors, he who is so anxious to conciliate\r\nstrangers!—then, I say, I thought that I ought to add to my forces certain\r\nvery powerful tribes and to obtain supplies of money, which I had a\r\nperfect right to coin, both gold and silver. Moreover if even now he would\r\nwelcome a reconciliation with me I would keep to what I at present\r\npossess; but if he should decide to go to war and will in no wise relent\r\nfrom his earlier purpose, then I ought to do and to suffer whatever is the\r\nwill of the gods; seeing that it would be more disgraceful to show myself\r\nhis inferior through failure of courage or lack of intelligence than in\r\nmere numbers. For if he now defeats me by force of numbers that will not\r\nbe his doing, but will be due to the larger army that he has at his\r\ncommand. If on the other hand he had surprised me loitering in Gaul and\r\nclinging to bare life and, while I tried to avoid the danger, had attacked\r\nme on all sides, in the rear and on the flanks by means of the barbarians,\r\nand in front by his own legions, I should I believe have had to face\r\ncomplete ruin, and moreover the disgrace of such conduct is greater than\r\nany punishment—at least in the sight of the wise.(491))\r\n\r\nΤαῦτα διανοηθείς, ἄνδρες Ἀθηναῖοι, τοῖς τε συστρατιώταις τοῖς ἐμοῖς\r\nδιῆλθον καὶ πρὸς κοινοὺς τῶν πάντων Ἑλλήνων πολίτας γράφω. θεοὶ δὲ [D] οἱ\r\nπάντων κύριοι συμμαχίαν ἡμῖν τὴν ἑαυτῶν, ὥσπερ ὑπέστησαν, εἰς τέλος δοῖεν\r\nκαὶ παράσχοιεν ταῖς Ἀθήναις ὑφ᾽ ἡμῶν τε εἰς ὅσον δύναμις εὖ παθεῖν καὶ\r\nτοιούτους σχεῖν ἐς ἀεὶ τοὺς αὐτοκράτορας, οἳ μάλιστα καὶ διαφερόντως αὐτὰς\r\nαἰδέσονται(492) καὶ ἀγαπήσουσιν.\r\n\r\n(These then are the views, men of Athens, which I have communicated to my\r\nfellow soldiers and which I am now writing to the whole body of the\r\ncitizens throughout all Greece. May the gods who decide all things\r\nvouchsafe me to the end the assistance which they have promised, and may\r\nthey grant to Athens all possible favours at my hands! May she always have\r\nsuch Emperors as will honour her and love her above and beyond all other\r\ncities!)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRAGMENT OF A LETTER TO A PRIEST\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n\r\nJulian was Supreme Pontiff, and as such felt responsible for the teachings\r\nand conduct of the priesthood. He saw that in order to offset the\r\ninfluence of the Christian priests which he thought was partly due to\r\ntheir moral teaching, partly to their charity towards the poor, the pagans\r\nmust follow their example. Hitherto the preaching of morals had been left\r\nto the philosophers. Julian’s admonitions as to the treatment of the poor\r\nand of those in prison, and the rules that he lays down for the private\r\nlife of a priest are evidently borrowed from the Christians.\r\n\r\nThis Fragment occurs in the Vossianus MS., inserted in the Letter to\r\nThemistius,(493) and was identified and published separately by Petavius.\r\nIt was probably written when Julian was at Antioch on the way to Persia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRAGMENTUM EPISTOLAE\r\n\r\n.... πλὴν ἢν εἰς τὸν βασιλέα ἐπίδωσιν ἀτακτοῦντάς τινας, αὐτίκα μάλα\r\nκολάζουσιν· ἐπὶ δὲ τοὺς οὐ προσιόντας τοῖς θεοῖς ἐστι τὸ τῶν πονηρῶν\r\nδαιμόνων τεταγμένον φῦλον, [B] ὑφ᾽ ὧν οἱ πολλοὶ παροιστρούμενοι τῶν ἀθέων\r\nἀναπείθονται θανατᾶν, ὡς ἀναπτησόμενοι πρὸς τὸν οὐρανόν, ὅταν ἀπορρήξωσι\r\nτὴν ψυχὴν βιαίως. εἰσὶ δὲ οἳ καὶ τὰς ἐρημίας ἀντὶ τῶν πόλεων διώκουσιν,\r\nὄντος τἀνθρώπου φύσει πολιτικοῦ ζῴου καὶ ἡμέρου, δαίμοσιν ἐκδεδομένοι\r\nπονηροῖς, ὑφ᾽ ὧν εἰς ταύτην ἄγονται τὴν μισανθρωπίαν. ἤδη δὲ καὶ δεσμὰ καὶ\r\nκλοιοὺς ἐξηῦρον οἱ πολλοὶ τούτων· οὕτω πανταχόθεν αὐτοὺς ὁ κακὸς\r\nσυνελαύνει δαίμων, ᾧ δεδώκασιν ἑκόντες ἑαυτούς, ἀποστάντες τῶν ἀιδίων καὶ\r\nσωτήρων θεῶν. [C] ἀλλ᾽ ὑπὲρ μὲν τούτων ἀπόχρη τοσαῦτα εἰπεῖν· ὅθεν δ᾽\r\nἐξέβην εἰς τοῦτο ἐπανήξω.\r\n\r\n(.... Only(494) that they chastise, then and there, any whom they see\r\nrebelling against their king. And the tribe of evil demons is appointed to\r\npunish those who do not worship the gods, and stung to madness by them\r\nmany atheists are induced to court death in the belief that they will fly\r\nup to heaven when they have brought their lives to a violent end. Some men\r\nthere are also who, though man is naturally a social and civilised being,\r\nseek out desert places instead of cities, since they have been given over\r\nto evil demons and are led by them into this hatred of their kind. And\r\nmany of them have even devised fetters and stocks to wear; to such a\r\ndegree does the evil demon to whom they have of their own accord given\r\nthemselves abet them in all ways, after they have rebelled against the\r\neverlasting and saving gods. But on this subject what I have said is\r\nenough, and I will go back to the point at which I digressed.)\r\n\r\nΔικαιοπραγίας οὖν τῆς μὲν κατὰ τοὺς πολιτικοὺς νόμους εὔδηλον ὅτι μελήσει\r\nτοῖς ἐπιτρόποις τῶν πόλεων, πρέποι δ᾽ ἂν καὶ ὑμῖν εἰς παραίνεσιν τὸ μὴ\r\nπαραβαίνειν ἱεροὺς ὄντας τῶν θεῶν τοὺς νόμους.

Moreover, inasmuch as the life of a priest ought\r\nto be more holy than the political life, you must guide and instruct men\r\nto adopt it. And the better sort will naturally follow your guidance. Nay\r\nI pray that all men may, but at any rate I hope that those who are\r\nnaturally good and upright will do so; for they will recognise that your\r\nteachings are peculiarly adapted to them.)\r\n\r\nἈσκητέα τοίνυν πρὸ πάντων ἡ φιλανθρωπία· ταύτῃ γὰρ ἕπεται πολλὰ μὲν καὶ\r\nἄλλα τῶν ἀγαθῶν, [B] ἐξαίρετον δὲ δὴ καὶ μέγιστον ἡ παρὰ τῶν θεῶν\r\nεὐμένεια. καθάπερ γὰρ οἱ τοῖς ἑαυτῶν δεσπόταις συνδιατιθέμενοι περί τε\r\nφιλίας καὶ σπουδὰς καὶ ἔρωτας ἀγαπῶνται πλέον τῶν ὁμοδούλων, οὕτω\r\nνομιστέον φύσει φιλάνθρωπον ὂν τὸ θεῖον ἀγαπᾶν τοὺς φιλανθρώπους τῶν\r\nἀνδρῶν. ἡ δὲ φιλανθρωπία πολλὴ καὶ παντοία· [C] καὶ τὸ πεφεισμένως\r\nκολάζειν τοὺς ἀνθρώπους ἐπὶ τῷ βελτίονι τῶν κολαζομένων, ὥσπερ οἱ\r\nδιδάσκαλοι τὰ παιδία, καὶ τὸ τὰς χρείας αὐτῶν ἐπανορθοῦν, ὥσπερ οἱ θεοὶ\r\nτὰς ἡμετέρας. ὁρᾶτε ὅσα ἡμῖν δεδώκασιν ἐκ τῆς γῆς ἀγαθά, τροφὰς παντοίας\r\nκαὶ ὁπόσας οὐδὲ ὁμοῦ πᾶσι τοῖς ζῴοις. ἐπεὶ δὲ ἐτέχθημεν γυμνοί, ταῖς τε\r\nτῶν ζῴων ἡμᾶς θριξὶν ἐσκέπασαν καὶ τοῖς ἐκ τῆς γῆς φυομένοις καὶ τοῖς ἐκ\r\nδένδρων, καὶ οὐκ ἤρκεσεν ἁπλῶς οὐδὲ αὐτοσχεδίως, [D] καθάπερ ὁ Μωυσῆς ἔφη\r\nτοὺς χιτῶνας λαβεῖν δερματίνους, ἀλλ᾽ ὁρᾶτε ὅσα ἐγένετο τῆς Ἐργάνης Ἀθηνᾶς\r\nτὰ δῶρα. ποῖον οἴνῳ χρῆται ζῷον; ποῖον ἐλαίῳ; πλὴν εἴ τισιν ἡμεῖς καὶ\r\nτούτων μεταδέδομεν, οἱ τοῖς ἀνθρώποις οὐ μεταδιδόντες. τί δὲ τῶν θαλαττίων\r\nσίτῳ, τί δὲ τῶν χερσαίων τοῖς ἐν τῇ θαλάττῃ χρῆται; χρυσὸν οὔπω λέγω καὶ\r\nχαλκὸν καὶ σίδηρον, οἷς πᾶσιν οἱ θεοὶ ζαπλούτους ἡμᾶς ἐποίησαν, οὐχ ἵνα\r\nὄνειδος αὐτῶν περιορῶμεν περινοστοῦντας τοὺς πένητας, ἄλλως τε ὅταν [290]\r\nκαὶ ἐπιεικεῖς τινες τύχωσι τὸν τρόπον, οἷς πατρῷος μὲν κλῆρος οὐ γέγονεν,\r\nὑπὸ δὲ μεγαλοψυχίας ἥκιστα ἐπιθυμοῦντες χρημάτων πένονται. τούτους ὁρῶντες\r\nοἱ πολλοὶ τοὺς θεοὺς ὀνειδίζουσιν. αἴτιοι δὲ θεοὶ μὲν οὐκ εἰσὶ τῆς τούτων\r\nπενίας, ἡ δὲ ἡμῶν τῶν κεκτημένων ἀπληστία καὶ τοῖς ἀνθρώποις ὑπὲρ τῶν θεῶν\r\nοὐκ ἀληθοῦς ὑπολήψεως αἰτία γίνεται καὶ προσέτι τοῖς θεοῖς ὀνείδους\r\nἀδίκου.

For just as those who are in agreement with their\r\nmasters about their friendships and ambitions and loves are more kindly\r\ntreated than their fellow slaves, so we must suppose that God, who\r\nnaturally loves human beings, has more kindness for those men who love\r\ntheir fellows. Now philanthropy has many divisions and is of many kinds.\r\nFor instance it is shown when men are punished in moderation with a view\r\nto the betterment of those punished, as schoolmasters punish children; and\r\nagain in ministering to men’s needs, even as the gods minister to our own.\r\nYou see all the blessings of the earth that they have granted to us, food\r\nof all sorts, and in an abundance that they have not granted to all other\r\ncreatures put together. And since we were born naked they covered us with\r\nthe hair of animals, and with things that grow in the ground and on trees.\r\nNor were they content to do this simply or off‐hand, as Moses tells us men\r\ntook coats of skins,(497) but you see how numerous are the gifts of Athene\r\nthe Craftswoman. What other animals use wine, or olive oil? Except indeed\r\nin cases where we let them share in these things, even though we do not\r\nshare them with our fellowmen. What creature of the sea uses corn, what\r\nland animal uses things that grow in the sea? And I have not yet mentioned\r\ngold and bronze and iron, though in all these the the gods have made us\r\nvery rich; yet not to the end that we may bring reproach on them by\r\ndisregarding the poor who go about in our midst, especially when they\r\nhappen to be of good character—men for instance who have inherited no\r\npaternal estate, and are poor because in the greatness of their souls they\r\nhave no desire for money. Now the crowd when they see such men blame the\r\ngods. However it is not the gods who are to blame for their poverty, but\r\nrather the insatiate greed of us men of property becomes the cause of this\r\nfalse conception of the gods among men, and besides of unjust blame of the\r\ngods. Of what use, I ask, is it for us to pray that God will rain gold on\r\nthe poor as he did on the people of Rhodes?(498) For even though this\r\nshould come to pass, we should forthwith set our slaves underneath to\r\ncatch it, and put out vessels everywhere, and drive off all comers so that\r\nwe alone might seize upon the gifts of the gods meant for all in common.\r\nAnd anyone would naturally think it strange if we should ask for this,\r\nwhich is not in the nature of things, and is in every way unprofitable,\r\nwhile we do not do what is in our power. Who, I ask, ever became poor by\r\ngiving to his neighbours? Indeed I myself, who have often given lavishly\r\nto those in need, have recovered my gifts again many times over at the\r\nhands of the gods, though I am a poor man of business; nor have I ever\r\nrepented of that lavish giving. And of the present time I will say\r\nnothing, for it would be altogether irrational of me to compare the\r\nexpenditure of private persons with that of an Emperor; but when I was\r\nmyself still a private person I know that this happened to me many times.\r\nMy grandmother’s estate for instance was kept for me untouched, though\r\nothers had taken possession of it by violence, because from the little\r\nthat I had I spent money on those in need and gave them a share.)\r\n\r\nΚοινωνητέον οὖν τῶν χρημάτων ἅπασιν ἀνθρώποις, ἀλλὰ τοῖς μὲν ἐπιεικέσιν\r\nἐλευθεριώτερον, τοῖς δὲ ἀπόροις καὶ πένησιν ὅσον ἐπαρκέσαι τῇ χρείᾳ. φαίνη\r\nδ᾽ ἄν, εἰ καὶ παράδοξον εἰπεῖν, ὅτι καὶ τοῖς πονηροῖς(499) ἐσθῆτος καὶ\r\nτροφῆς ὅσιον ἂν εἴη μεταδιδόναι· [291] τῷ γὰρ ἀνθρωπίνῳ καὶ οὐ τῷ τρόπῳ\r\nδίδομεν. διόπερ οἶμαι καὶ τοὺς ὲν δεσμωτηρίῳ καθειργμένους ἀξιωτέον τῆς\r\nτοιαύτης ἐπιμελείας. οὐδὲν γὰρ κωλύσει τὴν δίκην ἡ τοιαύτη φιλανθρωπία.\r\nχαλεπὸν γὰρ ἂν εἴη, πολλῶν ἀποκεκλεισμένων ἐπὶ κρίσει, καὶ τῶν μὲν\r\nὀφλησόντων, τῶν δὲ ἀθῴων ἀποφανθησομένων, μὴ διὰ τοὺς ἀναιτίους οἶκτόν\r\nτινα νέμειν καὶ τοῖς πονηροὶς, ἀλλὰ τῶν πονηρῶν [B] ἕνεκα καὶ περὶ τοὺς\r\nοὐδὲν ἠδικηκότας ἀνηλεῶς καὶ ἀπανθρώπως διακεῖσθαι. ἐκεῖνο δὲ ἐννοοῦντί\r\nμοι παντάπασιν ἄδικον καταφαίνεται· Ξένιον ὀνομάζομεν Δία, καὶ γιγνόμεθα\r\nτῶν Σκυθῶν κακοξενώτεροι. πῶς οὖν ὁ βουλόμενος τῷ Ξενίῳ θῦσαι Διὶ φοιτᾷ\r\nπρὸς τὸν νεών; μετὰ ποταποῦ συνειδότος, ἐπιλαθόμενος τοῦ\r\n\r\n(We ought then to share our money with all men, but more generously with\r\nthe good, and with the helpless and poor so as to suffice for their need.\r\nAnd I will assert, even though it be paradoxical to say so, that it would\r\nbe a pious act to share our clothes and food even with the wicked. For it\r\nis to the humanity in a man that we give, and not to his moral character.\r\nHence I think that even those who are shut up in prison have a right to\r\nthe same sort of care; since this kind of philanthropy will not hinder\r\njustice. For when many have been shut up in prison to await trial, of whom\r\nsome will be found guilty, while others will prove to be innocent, it\r\nwould be harsh indeed if out of regard for the guiltless we should not\r\nbestow some pity on the guilty also, or again, if on account of the guilty\r\nwe should behave ruthlessly and inhumanly to those also who have done no\r\nwrong. This too, when I consider it, seems to me altogether wrong; I mean\r\nthat we call Zeus by the title “God of Strangers,” while we show ourselves\r\nmore inhospitable to strangers than are the very Scythians.

When\r\nI observe this I am wholly amazed, since I see that these titles of the\r\ngods are from the beginning of the world their express images, yet in our\r\npractice we pay no attention to anything of the sort. The gods are called\r\nby us “gods of kindred,” and Zeus the “God of Kindred,” but we treat our\r\nkinsmen as though they were strangers. I say “kinsmen” because every man,\r\nwhether he will or no, is akin to every other man, whether it be true, as\r\nsome say, that we are all descended from one man and one woman, or whether\r\nit came about in some other way, and the gods created us all together, at\r\nthe first when the world began, not one man and one woman only, but many\r\nmen and many women at once. For they who had the power to create one man\r\nand one woman, were able to create many men and women at once; since the\r\nmanner of creating one man and one woman is the same as that of creating\r\nmany men and many women. And(505) one must have regard to the differences\r\nin our habits and laws, or still more to that which is higher and more\r\nprecious and more authoritative, I mean the sacred tradition of the gods\r\nwhich has been handed down to us by the theurgists of earlier days, namely\r\nthat when Zeus was setting all things in order there fell from him drops\r\nof sacred blood, and from them, as they say, arose the race of men. It\r\nfollows therefore that we are all kinsmen, whether, many men and women as\r\nwe are, we come from two human beings, or whether, as the gods tell us,\r\nand as we ought to believe, since facts bear witness thereto, we are all\r\ndescended from the gods. And that facts bear witness that many men came\r\ninto the world at once, I shall maintain elsewhere, and precisely, but for\r\nthe moment it will be enough to say this much, that if we were descended\r\nfrom one man and one woman, it is not likely that our laws would show such\r\ngreat divergence; nor in any case is it likely that the whole earth was\r\nfilled with people by one man; nay, not even if the women used to bear\r\nmany children at a time to their husbands, like swine. But when the gods\r\nall together had given birth to men, just as one man came forth, so in\r\nlike manner came forth many men who had been allotted to the gods who rule\r\nover births; and they brought them forth, receiving their souls from the\r\nDemiurge from eternity.(506))\r\n\r\nΚἀκεῖνο δ᾽ ἄξιον ἐννοεῖν, ὅσοι παρὰ τῶν ἔμπροσθεν ἀνάλωνται λόγοι περὶ τοῦ\r\nφύσει κοινωνικὸν εἶναι ζῷον τὸν ἄνθρωπον, ἡμεῖς οὖν οἱ ταῦτα εἰπόντες καὶ\r\nδιατάξαντες ἀκοινωνήτως πρὸς τοὺς πλησίον ἕξομεν; ἐκ δὴ τῶν τοιούτων ἠθῶν\r\nτε καὶ ἐπιτηδευμάτων ἕκαστος ἡμῶν ὁρμώμενος εὐλαβείας τῆς εἰς τοὺς θεούς,\r\n[293] χρηστότητος τῆς εἰς ἀνθρώπους, ἁγνείας τῆς περὶ τὸ σῶμα, τὰ τῆς\r\nεὐσεβείας ἔργα πληρούτω, πειρώμενος δὲ ἀεί τι περὶ τῶν θεῶν εὐσεβὲς\r\nδιανοεῖσθαι καὶ μετά τινος ἀποβλέπων εἰς τὰ ἱερὰ τῶν θεῶν καὶ τὰ ἀγάλματα\r\nτιμῆς καὶ ὁσιότητος, σεβόμενος ὥσπερ ἂν εἰ παρόντας ἑώρα τοὺς θεούς.\r\nἀγάλματα γὰρ καὶ βωμοὺς καὶ πυρὸς ἀσβέστου φυλακὴν καὶ πάντα ἁπλῶς τὰ\r\nτοιαῦτα σύμβολα οἱ πατέρες ἔθεντο τῆς παρουσίας τῶν θεῶν, [B] οὐχ ἵνα\r\nἐκεῖνα θεοὺς νομίσωμεν, ἀλλ᾽ ἵνα δι᾽ αὐτῶν τοὺς θεοὺς θεραπεύσωμεν. ἐπειδὴ\r\nγὰρ ἡμᾶς ὄντας ἐν σώματι σωματικῶς(507) ἔδει ποιεῖσθαι τοῖς θεοῖς καὶ τὰς\r\nλατρείας, ἀσώματοι δέ εἰσιν αὐτοί· πρῶτα μὲν ἔδειξαν ἡμῖν ἀγάλματα τὸ\r\nδεύτερον ἀπὸ τοῦ πρώτου τῶν θεῶν γένος περὶ πάντα τὸν οὐρανὸν κύκλῳ\r\nπεριφερόμενον.

And\r\nshall we, after, asserting this and enjoining it, bear ourselves\r\nunsociably to our neighbours? Then let everyone make the basis of his\r\nconduct moral virtues, and actions like these, namely reverence towards\r\nthe gods, benevolence towards men, personal chastity; and thus let him\r\nabound in pious acts, I mean by endeavouring always to have pious thoughts\r\nabout the gods, and by regarding the temples and images of the gods with\r\ndue honour and veneration, and by worshipping the gods as though he saw\r\nthem actually present. For our fathers established images and altars, and\r\nthe maintenance of undying fire, and, generally speaking, everything of\r\nthe sort, as symbols of the presence of the gods, not that we may regard\r\nsuch things as gods, but that we may worship the gods through them. For\r\nsince being in the body it was in bodily wise that we must needs perform\r\nour service to the gods also, though they are themselves without bodies;\r\nthey therefore revealed to us in the earliest images the class of gods\r\nnext in rank to the first, even those that revolve in a circle about the\r\nwhole heavens. But since not even to these can due worship be offered in\r\nbodily wise—for they are by nature not in need of anything(509)—another\r\nclass of images was invented on the earth, and by performing our worship\r\nto them we shall make the gods propitious to ourselves. For just as those\r\nwho make offerings to the statues of the emperors, who are in need of\r\nnothing, nevertheless induce goodwill towards themselves thereby, so too\r\nthose who make offerings to the images of the gods, though the gods need\r\nnothing, do nevertheless thereby persuade them to help and to care for\r\nthem. For zeal to do all that is in one’s power is, in truth, a proof of\r\npiety, and it is evident that he who abounds in such zeal thereby displays\r\na higher degree of piety; whereas he who neglects what is possible, and\r\nthen pretends to aim at what is impossible, evidently does not strive\r\nafter the impossible, since he overlooks the possible. For even though God\r\nstands in need of nothing, it does not follow that on that account nothing\r\nought to be offered to him. He does not need the reverence that is paid in\r\nwords. What then? Is it rational to deprive him of this also? By no means.\r\nIt follows then that one ought not to deprive him either of the honour\r\nthat is paid to him through deeds, an honour which not three years or\r\nthree thousand years have ordained, but all past time among all the\r\nnations of the earth.)\r\n\r\n[C] Ἀφορῶντες οὖν εἰς τὰ τῶν θεῶν ἀγάλματα μή τοι νομίζωμεν αὐτὰ λίθους\r\nεἶναι μηδὲ ξύλα, μηδὲ μέντοι τοὺς θεοὺς αὐτοὺς εἶναι ταῦτα. καὶ γὰρ οὐδὲ\r\nτὰς βασιλικὰς εἰκόνας ξύλα καὶ λίθον καὶ χαλκὸν λέγομεν, οὐ μὴν οὐδὲ\r\nαὐτοὺς τοὺς βασιλέας, ἀλλὰ εἰκόνας βασιλέων. ὅστις οὖν ἐστι φιλοβασιλεὺς\r\nἡδέως ὁρᾷ τὴν τοῦ βασιλέως εἰκόνα, καὶ ὅστις ἐστὶ [D] φιλόπαις ἡδέως ὁρᾷ\r\nτὴν τοῦ παιδός, καὶ ὅστις φιλοπάτωρ τὴν τοῦ πατρός. οὐκοῦν καὶ ὅστις\r\nφιλόθεος ἡδέως εἰς τὰ τῶν θεῶν ἀγάλματα καὶ τὰς εἰκόνας ἀποβλέπει,\r\nσεβόμενος ἅμα καὶ φρίττων ἐξ ἀφανοῦς ὁρῶντας εἰς αὐτὸν τοὺς θεούς. εἴ τις\r\nοὖν οἴεται δεῖν αὐτὰ μηδὲ φθείρεσθαι διὰ τὸ θεῶν ἅπαξ εἰκόνας κληθῆναι,\r\nπαντελῶς ἄφρων εἶναί μοι φαίνεται. χρῆν γὰρ δήπουθεν αὐτὰ μηδὲ [295] ὑπὸ\r\nἀνθρώπων γενέσθαι. τὸ δὲ ὑπ᾽ ἀνδρὸς σοφοῦ καὶ ἀγαθοῦ γενόμενον ὑπὸ\r\nἀνθρώπου πονηροῦ καὶ ἀμαθοῦς φθαρῆναι δύναται. τὰ δὲ ὑπὸ τῶν θεῶν ζῶντα\r\nἀγάλματα κατασκευασθέντα τῆς ἀφανοῦς αὐτῶν οὐσίας, οἱ περὶ τὸν οὐρανὸν\r\nκύκλῳ φερόμενοι θεοί, μένει τὸν ἀεὶ χρόνον ἀίδια. μηδεὶς οὖν ἀπιστείτω\r\nθεοῖς ὁρῶν καὶ ἀκούων, ὡς ἐνύβρισάν τινες εἰς τὰ ἀγάλματα καὶ τοὺς ναούς.\r\nἆρ᾽ οὐκ ἀνθρώπους χρηστοὺς ἀπέκτειναν πολλοί, [B] καθάπερ Σωκράτη καὶ\r\nΔίωνα καὶ τὸν μέγαν Ἐμπεδότιμον; ὧν εὖ οἶδ᾽ ὅτι μᾶλλον ἐμέλησε τοῖς θεοῖς.\r\nἀλλ᾽ ὁρᾶτε, ὅτι καὶ τούτων φθαρτὸν εἰδότες τὸ σῶμα συνεχώρησαν εἶξαι τῇ\r\nφύσει καὶ ὑποχωρῆσαι, δίκην δὲ ἀπῄτησαν ὕστερον παρὰ τῶν κτεινάντων. ὃ δὴ\r\nσυνέβη φανερῶς ἐφ᾽ ἡμῶν ἐπὶ πάντων τῶν ἱεροσύλων.\r\n\r\n(Therefore, when we look at the images of the gods, let us not indeed\r\nthink they are stones or wood, but neither let us think they are the gods\r\nthemselves; and indeed we do not say that the statues of the emperors are\r\nmere wood and stone and bronze, but still less do we say they are the\r\nemperors themselves. He therefore who loves the emperor delights to see\r\nthe emperor’s statue, and he who loves his son delights to see his son’s\r\nstatue, and he who loves his father delights to see his father’s statue.\r\nIt follows that he who loves the gods delights to gaze on the images of\r\nthe gods, and their likenesses, and he feels reverence and shudders with\r\nawe of the gods who look at him from the unseen world. Therefore if any\r\nman thinks that because they have once been called likenesses of the gods,\r\nthey are incapable of being destroyed, he is, it seems to me, altogether\r\nfoolish; for surely in that case they were incapable of being made by\r\nmen’s hands. But what has been made by a wise and good man can be\r\ndestroyed by a bad and ignorant man. But those beings which were fashioned\r\nby the gods as the living images of their invisible nature, I mean the\r\ngods who revolve in a circle in the heavens, abide imperishable for all\r\ntime. Therefore let no man disbelieve in gods because he sees and hears\r\nthat certain persons have profaned their images and temples. Have they not\r\nin many cases put good men to death, like Socrates and Dio and the great\r\nEmpedotimus?(510) And yet I am very sure that the gods cared more for\r\nthese men than for the temples. But observe that since they knew that the\r\nbodies even of these men were destructible, they allowed them to yield to\r\nnature and to submit, but later on they exacted punishment from their\r\nslayers; and this has happened in the sight of all, in our own day also,\r\nin the case of all who have profaned the temples.)\r\n\r\nΜηδεὶς οὖν ἀπατάτω λόγοις μηδὲ ταραττέτω περὶ τῆς προνοίας ἡμᾶς.

For as for those who make such profanation a reproach\r\nagainst us, I mean the prophets of the Jews, what have they to say about\r\ntheir own temple, which was overthrown three times and even now is not\r\nbeing raised up again? This I mention not as a reproach against them, for\r\nI myself, after so great a lapse of time, intended to restore it, in\r\nhonour of the god whose name has been associated with it. But in the\r\npresent case I have used this instance because I wish to prove that\r\nnothing made by man can be indestructible and that those prophets who\r\nwrote such statements were uttering nonsense, due to their gossiping with\r\nsilly old women. In my opinion there is no reason why their god should not\r\nbe a mighty god, even though he does not happen to have wise prophets or\r\ninterpreters. But the real reason why they are not wise is that they have\r\nnot submitted their souls to be cleansed by the regular course of study,\r\nnor have they allowed those studies to open their tightly closed eyes, and\r\nto clear away the mist that hangs over them. But since these men see as it\r\nwere a great light through a fog, not plainly or clearly, and since they\r\nthink that what they see is not a pure light but a fire, and they fail to\r\ndiscern all that surrounds it, they cry with a loud voice: “Tremble, be\r\nafraid, fire, flame, death, a dagger, a broad‐sword!” thus describing\r\nunder many names the harmful might of fire. But on this subject it will be\r\nbetter to demonstrate separately how much inferior to our own poets are\r\nthese teachers of tales about the gods.)\r\n\r\nΠροσήκει δὲ οῦ τὰ τῶν θεῶν μόνον ἀγάλματα προσκυνεῖν, ἀλλὰ καὶ τοὺς ναοὺς\r\nκαὶ τὰ τεμένη καὶ τοὺς βωμούς· εὔλογον δὲ καὶ τοὺς ἱερέας τιμᾶν ὡς\r\nλειτουργοὺς θεῶν καὶ ὑπηρέτας καὶ διακονοῦντας ἡμῖν τὰ πρὸς τοὺς θεούς,\r\nσυνεπισχύοντας τῇ ἐκ θεῶν [C] εἰς ἡμᾶς τῶν ἀγαθῶν δόσει· προθύουσι γὰρ\r\nπάντων καὶ ὑπερεύχονται. δίκαιον οὖν ἀποδιδόναι πᾶσιν αὐτοῖς οὐκ ἔλαττον,\r\nεἰ μὴ καὶ πλέον, ἢ τοῖς πολιτικοῖς ἄρχουσι τὰς τιμάς. εἰ δέ τις οἴεται\r\nτοῦτο ἐπ᾽ ἴσης χρῆναι νέμειν αὐτοῖς καὶ τοῖς πολιτικοῖς ἄρχουσιν, ἐπεὶ\r\nκἀκεῖνοι τρόπον τινὰ τοῖς θεοῖς ἱερατεύουσι, φύλακες ὄντες τῶν νόμων, ἀλλὰ\r\nτά γε τῆς εὐνοίας παρὰ πολὺ χρὴ νέμειν τούτοις.

And it is reasonable to honour\r\nthe priests also as officials and servants of the gods; and because they\r\nminister to us what concerns the gods, and they lend strength to the gods’\r\ngift of good things to us; for they sacrifice and pray on behalf of all\r\nmen. It is therefore right that we should pay them all not less, if not\r\nindeed more, than the honours that we pay to the magistrates of the state.\r\nAnd if any one thinks that we ought to assign equal honours to them and to\r\nthe magistrates of the state, since the latter also are in some sort\r\ndedicated to the service of the gods, as being guardians of the laws,\r\nnevertheless we ought at any rate to give the priests a far greater share\r\nof our good will. The Achaeans, for instance, enjoined on their king(511)\r\nto reverence the priest, though he was one of the enemy, whereas we do not\r\neven reverence the priests who are our friends, and who pray and sacrifice\r\non our behalf.)\r\n\r\nἈλλ᾽ ἐπείπερ ὁ λόγος εἰς τὴν πάλαι ποθουμένην ἀρχὴν ἐλήλυθεν, ἄξιον εἶναί\r\nμοι δοκεῖ διελθεῖν ἐφεξῆς, ὁποῖός τις ὢν ὁ ἱερεὺς αὐτός τε δικαίως\r\nτιμηθήσεται καὶ τοὺς θεοὺς τιμᾶσθαι ποιήσει.(512) τὸ γὰρ ἡμέτερον οὐ χρὴ\r\nσκοπεῖν οὐδὲ ἐξετάζειν, [297] ἀλλὰ ἕως ἂν ἱερεύς τις ὀνομάζηται, τιμᾶν\r\nαὐτὸν χρὴ καὶ θεραπεύειν, εἰ δὲ εἴη πονηρός, ἀφαιρεθέντα τὴν ἱερωσύνην ὡς\r\nἀνάξιον ἀποφανθέντα περιορᾶν· ἕως δὲ προθύει καὶ κατάρχεται καὶ παρίσταται\r\nτοῖς θεοῖς, ὡς τὸ τιμιώτατον τῶν θεῶν κτῆμα προσβλεπτέος ἐστὶν ἡμῖν μετὰ\r\nαἰδοῦς καὶ εὐλαβείας. ἄτοπον γάρ, εἰ τοὺς μὲν λίθους, ἐξ ὧν οἱ βωμοὶ\r\nπεποίηνται, διὰ τὸ καθιερῶσθαι τοῖς θεοῖς ἀγαπῶμεν,(513) ὅτι μορφὴν ἔχουσι\r\nκαὶ σχῆμα πρέπον, εἰς [B] ἥν εἰσι κατεσκευασμένοι λειτουργίαν, ἄνδρα δὲ\r\nκαθωσιωμένον τοῖς θεοῖς οὐκ οἰησόμεθα χρῆναι τιμᾶν. ἴσως ὑπολήψεταί τις·\r\nἀλλὰ ἀδικοῦντα καὶ ἐξαμαρτάνοντα πολλὰ τῶν πρὸς τοὺς θεοὺς ὁσίων; ἐγὼ δή\r\nφημι χρῆναι τὸν μὲν τοιοῦτον ἐξελέγχειν, ἵνα μὴ πονηρὸς ὢν ἐνοχλῇ τοὺς\r\nθεούς, ἕως δ᾽ ἂν ἐξελέγξῃ(514) τις, μὴ ἀτιμάζειν. οὐδὲ γὰρ [C] εὔλογον\r\nἐπιλαβομένους ταύτης τῆς ἀφορμῆς οὐ τούτων μόνον, ἀλλὰ καὶ τῶν ἐπιτηδείων\r\nτιμᾶσθαι τὴν τιμὴν προσαφαιρεῖσθαι. ἔστω τοίνυν ὥσπερ ἄρχων, οὕτω δὲ καὶ\r\nἱερεὺς πᾶς αἰδέσιμος, ἐπειδὴ καὶ ἀπόφασίς ἐστι θεοῦ τοῦ Διδυμαίου τοιαύτη·\r\n\r\n(But since my discourse has come back again to the beginning as I have so\r\nlong wished, I think it is worth while for me to describe next in order\r\nwhat sort of man a priest ought to be, in order that he may justly be\r\nhonoured himself and may cause the gods to be honoured. For as for us, we\r\nought not to investigate or enquire as to his conduct, but so long as a\r\nman is called a priest we ought to honour and cherish him, but if he prove\r\nto be wicked we ought to allow his priestly office to be taken away from\r\nhim, since he has shown himself unworthy of it. But so long as he\r\nsacrifices for us and makes offerings and stands in the presence of the\r\ngods, we must regard him with respect and reverence as the most highly\r\nhonoured chattel(515) of the gods. For it would be absurd for us to pay\r\nrespect to the very stones of which the altars are made, on account of\r\ntheir being dedicated to the gods, because they have a certain shape and\r\nform suited to the ritual for which they have been fashioned, and then not\r\nto think that we ought to honour a man who has been dedicated to the gods.\r\nPerhaps someone will object—“But suppose he does wrong and often fails to\r\noffer to the gods their sacred rites?” Then indeed I answer that we ought\r\nto convict a man of that sort, so that he may not by wickedness offend the\r\ngods; but that we ought not to dishonour him until he has been convicted.\r\nNor indeed is it reasonable that when we have set our hands to this\r\nbusiness, we should take away their honour not only from these offenders\r\nbut also from those who are worthy to be honoured. Then let every priest,\r\nlike every magistrate, be treated with respect, since there is also an\r\noracle to that effect from the Didymaean god:(516))\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ὅσσοι ἐς ἀρητῆρας ἀτασθαλίῃσι νόοιο\r\n    Ἀθανάτων ῥέζουσ᾽ ἀποφώλια, καὶ γεράεσσιν\r\n    [D] Ἀντία βουλεύουσιν ἀδεισιθέοισι λογισμοῖς,\r\n    Οὐκέθ᾽ ὅλην βιότοιο διεκπερόωσιν ἀταρπόν,\r\n    Ὅσσοι περ μακάρεσσιν ἐλωβήσαντο θεοῖσιν,\r\n    Ὧν κεῖνοι θεόσεπτον ἕλον θεραπηίδα τιμήν,\r\n\r\n    (“As for men who with reckless minds work wickedness against the\r\n    priests of the deathless gods and plot against their privileges\r\n    with plans that fear not the gods, never shall such men travel\r\n    life’s path to the end, men who have sinned against the blessed\r\n    gods whose honour and holy service those priests have in\r\n    charge.”(517))\r\n\r\n\r\nκαὶ πάλιν ἐν ἄλλοις ὁ θεός φησι\r\n\r\n(And again in another oracle the god says:)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Πάντας μὲν θεράποντας ἐμοὺς ὀλοῆς κακότητος—,\r\n\r\n    (“All my servants from harmful mischief——;”(518))\r\n\r\n\r\nκαί φησιν ὑπὲρ τούτων δίκην ἐπιθήσειν αὐτοῖς.\r\n\r\n(and he says that on their behalf he will inflict punishment on the\r\naggressors.)\r\n\r\nΠολλῶν δὲ εἰρημένων τοιούτων παρὰ τοῦ θεοῦ, δι᾽ ὧν ἔνεστι μαθόντας ὅπως\r\nχρὴ τιμᾶν καὶ θεραπεύειν τοὺς ἱερέας, εἰρήσεταί μοι διὰ πλειόνων ἐν\r\nἄλλοις· ἀπόχρη δὲ νῦν, ὅτι μὴ σχεδιάζω μηδέν, [B] ἐπιδεῖξαι τήν τε ἐκ τοῦ\r\nθεοῦ πρόρρησιν καὶ τὸ ἐπίταγμα τῶν αὐτοῦ λόγων ἱκανὸν ἡγούμενος. εἴ τις\r\nοὖν ἀξιόπιστον ὑπείληφεν ἐμὲ διδάσκαλον τῶν τοιούτων, αἰδεσθεὺς τὸν θεὸν\r\nἐκείνῳ πειθέσθω καὶ τοὺς ἱερέας τῶν θεῶν τιμάτω διαφερόντως· ὁποῖον δὲ\r\nαὐτὸν εἶναι χρή, πειράσομαι νῦν εἰπεῖν, οὐχ ἕνεκα σοῦ· τοῦτο μὲν γὰρ εἰ μὴ\r\nτό νῦν ἠπιστάμην, ἅμα μὲν τοῦ καθηγεμόνος, ἅμα δὲ τῶν μεγίστων θεῶν\r\nμαρτυρούντων, ὅτι τὴν λειτουργίαν [C] ταύτην διαθήσῃ καλῶς, ὅσα γε εἰς\r\nπροαίρεσιν ἥκει τὴν σήν, οὐδ᾽ ἂν ἐτόλμησά σοι μεταδοῦναι τοσούτου\r\nπράγματος· ἀλλ᾽ ὅπως ἔχῃς ἐντεῦθεν διδάσκειν τοὺς ἄλλους, οὐκ ἐν ταῖς\r\nπόλεσι μόνον, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἀγροῖς εὐλογώτερον καὶ ἐπ᾽ ἐξουσίας, ὡς οὐκ\r\nοἴκοθεν αὐτὰ νοεῖς καὶ πράττεις μόνος, ἔχεις δὲ καὶ ἐμὲ σύμψηφον σεαυτῷ,\r\nδοκοῦντα γε εἶναι διὰ τοὺς θεοὺς ἀρχιερέα μέγιστον, ἄξιον μὲν οὐδαμῶς\r\nπράγματος τοσούτου, βουλόμενον δὲ εἶναι καὶ προσευχόμενον ἀεὶ τοῖς θεοῖς.\r\n[D] εὖ γὰρ ἴσθι, μεγάλας ἡμῖν οἱ θεοὶ μετὰ τὴν τελευτὴν ἐλπίδας\r\nἐπαγγέλλονται. πειστέον δὲ αὐτοῖς πάντως. ἀψευδεῖν γὰρ εἰώθασιν οὐχ ὑπὲρ\r\nἐκείνων μόνον, ἀλλὰ καὶ τῶν ἐν τῷ βίῳ τῷδε. οἱ δὲ διὰ περιουσίαν δυνάμεως\r\nοἷοί [299] τε ὄντες καὶ τῆς ἐν τῷ βίῳ τούτῳ περιγενέσθαι ταραχῆς καὶ τὸ\r\nἄτακτον αὐτοῦ καὶ τὸ ἀλλόκοτον ἐπανορθοῦν ἆρ᾽ οὐκ ἐν ἐκείνῳ μᾶλλον, ὅπου\r\nδιῄρηται τὰ μαχόμενα, χωρισθείσης μὲν τῆς ἀθανάτου ψυχῆς, γῆς δὲ γενομένου\r\nτοῦ νεκροῦ σώματος, ἱκανοὶ παρασχεῖν ἔσονται ταῦθ᾽ ὅσαπερ ἐπηγγείλαντο\r\nτοῖς ἀνθρώποις; εἰδότες οὖν, ὅτι μεγάλας ἔχειν ἔδοσαν οἱ θεοὶ τοῖς ἱερεῦσι\r\nτὰς ἀμοιβάς, ἐγγύους αὐτοὺς ἐν πᾶσι [B] τῆς ἀξίας τῶν θεῶν κατασκευάσωμεν,\r\nὧν πρὸς τὰ πλήθη χρὴ λέγειν δεῖγμα τὸν ἑαυτῶν ἐκφέροντας βίον.\r\n\r\n(Now though there are many utterances of the god to the same effect, by\r\nmeans of which we may learn to honour and cherish priests as we ought, I\r\nshall speak on this subject elsewhere at greater length. But for the\r\npresent it is enough to point out that I am not inventing anything\r\noffhand, since I think that the declaration made by the god and the\r\ninjunction expressed in his own words are sufficient. Therefore let any\r\nman who considers that as a teacher of such matters I am worthy to be\r\nbelieved show due respect to the god and obey him, and honour the priests\r\nof the gods above all other men. And now I will try to describe what sort\r\nof man a priest himself ought to be, though not for your especial benefit.\r\nFor if I did not already know from the evidence both of the high priest\r\nand of the most mighty gods that you administer this priestly office\r\naright—at least all matters that come under your management—I should not\r\nhave ventured to confide to you a matter so important. But I do so in\r\norder that you may be able from what I say to instruct the other priests,\r\nnot only in the cities but in the country districts also, more\r\nconvincingly and with complete freedom; since not of your own self do you\r\nalone devise these precepts and practise them, but you have me also to\r\ngive you support, who by the grace of the gods am known as sovereign\r\npontiff, though I am indeed by no means worthy of so high an office;\r\nthough I desire, and moreover constantly pray to the gods that I may be\r\nworthy. For the gods, you must know, hold out great hopes for us after\r\ndeath; and we must believe them absolutely. For they are always truthful,\r\nnot only about the future life, but about the affairs of this life also.\r\nAnd since in the superabundance of their power they are able both to\r\novercome the confusion that exists in this life and to regulate its\r\ndisorders and irregularities, will they not all the more in that other\r\nlife where conflicting things are reconciled, after the immortal soul has\r\nbeen separated from the body and the lifeless body has turned to earth, be\r\nable to bestow all those things for which they have held out hopes to\r\nmankind? Therefore since we know that the gods have granted to their\r\npriests a great recompense, let us make them responsible in all things for\r\nmen’s esteem of the gods, displaying their own lives as an example of what\r\nthey ought to preach to the people.)\r\n\r\nἈρκτέον δὲ ἡμῖν τῆς πρὸς τοὺς θεοὺς εὐσεβείας. οὕτω γὰρ ἡμᾶς πρέπει τοῖς\r\nθεοῖς λειτουργεῖν ὡς παρεστηκόσιν αὐτοῖς καὶ ὁρῶσι μὲν ἡμᾶς, οὐχ ὁρωμένοις\r\nδὲ ὑφ᾽ ἡμῶν καὶ τὸ πάσης αὐγᾶς ὄμμα κρεῖττον ἄχρι [C] τῶν ἀποκρυπτομένων\r\nἡμῖν λογισμῶν διατετακόσιν. ὅτι δὲ οὐκ ἐμὸς ὁ λόγος οὗτος ἐστιν, ἀλλὰ τοῦ\r\nθεοῦ, διὰ πολλῶν μὲν εἰρημένος λόγων, ἐμοὶ δὲ δῆτα ἀπόχρη καὶ ἕνα\r\nπαραθεμένῳ δύο δι᾽ ἑνὸς παραστῆσαι, πῶς μὲν ὁρῶσιν οἱ θεοὶ πάντα, πῶς δὲ\r\n῍πὶ τοῖς εὐσεβέσιν εὐφραίνονται·\r\n\r\n(The first thing we ought to preach is reverence towards the gods. For it\r\nis fitting that we should perform our service to the gods as though they\r\nwere themselves present with us and beheld us, and though not seen by us\r\ncould direct their gaze, which is more powerful than any light, even as\r\nfar as our hidden thoughts. And this saying is not my own(519) but the\r\ngod’s, and has been declared in many utterances, but for me surely it is\r\nsufficient, by bringing forth one such utterance, to illustrate two things\r\nin one, namely how the gods see all things and how they rejoice in god‐\r\nfearing men:)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Πάντη Φοιβείη τέταται τανυσίσκοπος ἀκτίς·\r\n    [D] Καί τε διὰ στερεῶν χωρεῖ θοὸν ὄμμα πετράων,\r\n    Καὶ διὰ κυανέης ἁλὸς ἔρχεται, οὐδέ ἑ λήθει\r\n    Πληθὺς ἀστερόεσσα παλινδίνητος ἰοῦσα\r\n    Οὐρανὸν εἰς ἀκάμαντα σοφῆς κατὰ θεσμὸν ἀνάγκης,\r\n    Οὐδ᾽ ὅσα νερτερίων ὑπεδέξατο φῦλα καμόντων\r\n    Τάρταρος [300] ἀχλυόεντος(520) ὑπὸ ζόφον ἀίδος εἴσω·\r\n    Εὐσεβέσιν δὲ βροτοῖς γάνυμαι τόσον, ὅσσον Ὀλύμπῳ.\r\n\r\n    (“On all sides extend the far‐seeing rays of Phoebus. His swift\r\n    gaze pierces even through sturdy rocks, and travels through the\r\n    dark blue sea, nor is he unaware of the starry multitude that\r\n    passes in returning circuit through the unwearied heavens for ever\r\n    by the statutes of necessity; nor of all the tribes of the dead in\r\n    the underworld whom Tartarus has admitted within the misty\r\n    dwelling of Hades, beneath the western darkness. And I delight in\r\n    god‐fearing men as much even as in Olympus.”(521))\r\n\r\n\r\nὍσῳ δὲ λίθου καὶ πέτρας ἅπασα μὲν ψυχή, πολὺ δὲ πλέον ἡ τῶν ἀνθρώπων\r\nοἰκειότερον ἔχει καὶ συγγενέστερον πρὸς τοὺς θεούς, τοσούτῳ μᾶλλον εἰκός\r\nἐστι ῥᾷον καὶ ἐνεργέστερον δι᾽ αὐτῆς χωρεῖν τῶν θεῶν τὸ ὄμμα.

How then shall he not lead up our souls from the darkness and from\r\nTartarus, if we approach him with pious awe? And indeed he has knowledge\r\neven of those who have been imprisoned in Tartarus—for not even that\r\nregion falls outside the power of the gods,—and to the god‐fearing he\r\npromises Olympus instead of Tartarus. Wherefore we ought by all means to\r\nhold fast to deeds of piety, approaching the gods with reverence, and\r\nneither saying nor listening to anything base. And the priests ought to\r\nkeep themselves pure not only from impure or shameful acts, but also from\r\nuttering words and hearing speeches of that character. Accordingly we must\r\nbanish all offensive jests and all licentious intercourse. And that you\r\nmay understand what I mean by this, let no one who has been consecrated a\r\npriest read either Archilochus or Hipponax(525) or anyone else who writes\r\nsuch poems as theirs. And in Old Comedy let him avoid everything of that\r\ntype—for it is better so—and indeed on all accounts philosophy alone will\r\nbe appropriate for us priests; and of philosophers only those who chose\r\nthe gods as guides of their mental discipline, like Pythagoras and Plato\r\nand Aristotle, and the school of Chrysippus and Zeno. For we ought not to\r\ngive heed to them all nor to the doctrines of all, but only to those\r\nphilosophers and those of their doctrines that make men god‐fearing, and\r\nteach concerning the gods, first that they exist, secondly that they\r\nconcern themselves with the things of this world, and further that they do\r\nno injury at all either to mankind or to one another out of jealousy or\r\nenvy or enmity. I mean the sort of thing our poets in the first place have\r\nbrought themselves into disrepute by writing, and in the second place such\r\ntales as the prophets of the Jews take pains to invent, and are admired\r\nfor so doing by those miserable men who have attached themselves to the\r\nGalilaeans.)\r\n\r\nΠρέποι δ᾽ ἂν ἡμῖν ἱστορίαις ἐντυγχάνειν, ὁπόσαι συνεγράφησαν ἐπὶ\r\nπεποιημένοις τοῖς ἔργοις· ὅσα δὲ ἐστιν ἐν ἱστορίας εἴδει παρὰ τοῖς\r\nἔμπροσθεν ἀπηγγελμένα πλάσματα παραιτητέον, ἐρωτικὰς ὑποθέσεις καὶ πάντα\r\nἁπλῶς τὰ τοιαῦτα. καθάπερ γὰρ οὐδὲ ὁδὸς πᾶσα τοῖς ἱερωμένοις ἁρμόττει,\r\nτετάχθαι δὲ χρὴ καὶ ταύτας, [C] οὕτως οὐδὲ ἀνάγνωσμα πᾶν ἱερωμένῳ πρέπει.\r\nἐγγίνεται γάρ τις τῇ ψυχῇ διάθεσις ὑπὸ τῶν λόγων, καὶ κατ᾽ ὀλίγον ἐγείρει\r\nτὰς ἐπιθυμίας, εἶτα ἐξαίφνης ἀνάπτει δεινὴν φλόγα, πρὸς ἣν οἶμαι χρὴ\r\nπόρρωθεν παρατετάχθαι.\r\n\r\n(But for us it will be appropriate to read such narratives as have been\r\ncomposed about deeds that have actually been done; but we must avoid all\r\nfictions in the form of narrative such as were circulated among men in the\r\npast, for instance tales whose theme is love, and generally speaking\r\neverything of that sort. For just as not every road is suitable for\r\nconsecrated priests, but the roads they travel ought to be duly assigned,\r\nso not every sort of reading is suitable for a priest. For words breed a\r\ncertain sort of disposition in the soul, and little by little it arouses\r\ndesires, and then on a sudden kindles a terrible blaze, against which one\r\nought, in my opinion, to arm oneself well in advance.)\r\n\r\nΜήτε Ἐπικούρειος εἰσίτω λόγος μήτε Πυρρώνειος· ἤδη μὲν γὰρ καλῶς ποιοῦντες\r\nοἱ θεοὶ καὶ ἀνῃρήκασιν, [D] ὥστε ἐπιλείπειν καὶ τὰ πλεῖστα τῶν βιβλίων.\r\nὅμως οὐδὲν κωλύει τύπου χάριν ἐπιμνησθῆναι μὲν καὶ τούτων, ὁποίων χρὴ\r\nμάλιστα τοὺς ἱερέας ἀπέχεσθαι λόγων, εἰ δὲ λόγων, πολὺ πρότερον ἐννοιῶν.\r\nοὐδὲ γὰρ οἶμαι ταὐτόν ἐστιν ἁμάρτημα γλώττης καὶ διανοίας, ἀλλ᾽ ἐκείνην\r\nχρὴ μάλιστα θεραπεύειν, ὡς καὶ τῆς γλώττης ἐκείνῃ συνεξαμαρτανούσης.\r\nἐκμανθάνειν χρὴ τοὺς ὕμνους τῶν θεῶν· εἰσὶ δὲ οὗτοι πολλοὶ μὲν καὶ καλοὶ\r\nπεποιημένοι παλαιοῖς καὶ νέοις· οὐ μὴν ἀλλ᾽ ἐκείνους πειρατέον ἐπίστασθαι\r\nτοὺς ἐν τοῖς ἱεροῖς ᾀδομένους. οἱ πλεῖστοι γὰρ ὑπ᾽ αὐτῶν τῶν θεῶν\r\nἱκετευθέντων ἐδόθησαν, [302] ὀλίγοι δέ τινες ἐποιήθησαν καὶ παρὰ ἀνθρώπων,\r\nὑπὸ πνεύματος ἐνθέου καὶ ψυχῆς ἀβάτου τοῖς κακοῖς ἐπὶ τῇ τῶν θεῶν τιμῇ\r\nσυγκείμενοι.\r\n\r\n(Let us not admit discourses by Epicurus or Pyrrho; but indeed the gods\r\nhave already in their wisdom destroyed their works, so that most of their\r\nbooks have ceased to be. Nevertheless there is no reason why I should not,\r\nby way of example, mention these works too, to show what sort of\r\ndiscourses priests must especially avoid; and if such discourses, then\r\nmuch more must they avoid such thoughts. For an error of speech is, in my\r\nopinion, by no means the same as an error of the mind, but we ought to\r\ngive heed to the mind first of all, since the tongue sins in company with\r\nit. We ought to learn by heart the hymns in honour of the gods—many and\r\nbeautiful they are, composed by men of old and of our own time—though\r\nindeed we ought to try to know also those which are being sung in the\r\ntemples. For the greater number were bestowed on us by the gods\r\nthemselves, in answer to prayer, though some few also were written by men,\r\nand were composed in honour of the gods by the aid of divine inspiration\r\nand a soul inaccessible to things evil.)\r\n\r\nΤαῦτά γε ἄξιον ἐπιτηδεύειν καὶ εὔχεσθαι πολλάκις τοῖς θεοῖς ἰδίᾳ καὶ\r\nδημοσίᾳ, μάλιστα μὲν τρὶς τῆς ἡμέρας, εἰ δὲ μή, πάντως ὄρθρου γε(526) καὶ\r\nδείλης· οὐδὲ γὰρ εὔλογον ἄθυτον ἄγειν ἡμέραν ἢ νύκτα τὸν ἱερωμένον· [B]\r\nἀρχὴ δὲ ὄρθρος μὲν ἡμέρας, ὀψία δὲ νυκτός. εὔλογον δὲ ἀμφοτέρων τοῖς θεοῖς\r\nἀπάρχεσθαι τῶν διαστημάτων, ὅταν ἔξωθεν τῆς ἱερατικῆς ὄντες τυγχάνωμεν,\r\nλειτουργίας· ὡς τά γε ἐν τοῖς ἱεροῖς, ὅσα πάτριος διαγορεύει νόμος,\r\nφυλάττειν πρέπει, καὶ οὔτε πλέον οὔτε ἔλαττόν τι ποιητέον αὐτῶν· ἀίδια γάρ\r\nἐστι τὰ τῶν θεῶν· ὥστε καὶ ἡμᾶς χρὴ μιμεῖσθαι τὴν οὐσίαν αὐτῶν, [C] ἵν᾽\r\nαὐτοὺς ἱλασκώμεθα διὰ τοῦτο πλέον.\r\n\r\n(All this, at least, we ought to study to do, and we ought also to pray\r\noften to the gods, both in private and in public, if possible three times\r\na day, but if not so often, certainly at dawn and in the evening. For it\r\nis not meet that a consecrated priest should pass a day or a night without\r\nsacrifice; and dawn is the beginning of the day as twilight is of the\r\nnight. And it is proper to begin both periods with sacrifice to the gods,\r\neven when we happen not to be assigned to perform the service. For it is\r\nour duty to maintain all the ritual of the temples that the law of our\r\nfathers prescribes, and we ought to perform neither more nor less than\r\nthat ritual; for eternal are the gods, so that we too ought to imitate\r\ntheir essential nature in order that thereby we may make them propitious.)\r\n\r\nΕἰ μὲν οὖν ἦμεν αὐτοψυχαὶ μόναι τὸ σῶμα δὲ πρὸς μηδὲν ἡμῖν διώχλει, καλῶς\r\nἂν εἶχεν ἕνα τινὰ τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν ἀφορέζειν βίον· ἐπεὶ δὲ οὐχ ἱερεῦσιν\r\nἁπλῶς, ἀλλὰ καὶ τῷ(527) ἱερεῖ προσήκει μόνον, ὃ δὴ κατὰ τὸν καιρὸν τῆς\r\nλειτουργίας ἐπιτηδευτέον, τί δὲ τῷ(528) ἱερατεύειν ἀνθρώπῳ λαχόντι\r\nσυγχωρητέον, ὅταν ἐκτὸς ᾖ τῆς ἐν τοῖς ἱεροῖς λειτουργίας; οἶμαι δὲ χρῆναι\r\n[D] τὸν ἱερέα πάντων ἁγνεύσαντα νύκτα καὶ ἡμέραν, εἶτα ἄλλην ἐπ᾽ αὐτῇ\r\nνύκτα καθηράμενον οἷς διαγορεύουσιν οἱ θεσμοὶ καθαρμοῖς οὕτως εἴσω\r\nφοιτῶντα τοῦ ἱεροῦ μένειν ὅσας ἂν ἡμέρας ὁ νόμος κελεύῃ. τριάκοντα μὲν γὰρ\r\nαἱ παρ᾽ ἡμῖν εἰσιν ἐν Ῥώμῃ, παρ᾽ ἄλλοις δὲ ἄλλως. εὔλογον οὖν οἶμαι μένειν\r\nἁπάσας ταύτας τὰς ἡμέρας ἐν τοῖς ἱεροῖς φιλοσοφοῦντα, καὶ μήτε εἰς οἰκίαν\r\nβαδίζειν μήτε εἰς ἀγοράν, [303] ἀλλὰ μηδὲ ἄρχοντα πλὴν ἐν τοῖς ἱεροῖς\r\nὁρᾶν, ἐπιμελεῖσθαι δὲ τῆς περὶ τὸ θεῖον θεραπείας αὐτὸν ἐφορῶντα πάντα καὶ\r\nδιατάττοντα, πληρώσαντα δὲ τὰς ἡμέρας εἶτα ἑτέρῳ παραχωρεῖν τῆς\r\nλειτουργίας. ἐπὶ δὲ τὸν ἀνθρώπινον τρεπομένῳ βίον ἐξέστω καὶ βαδίζειν εἰς\r\nοἰκίαν φίλου καὶ εἰς ἑστίασιν ἀπαντᾶν παρακληθέντα, [B] μὴ πάντων, ἀλλὰ\r\nτῶν βελτίστων· ἐν τούτῳ δὲ καὶ εἰς ἀγορὰν παρελθεῖν οὐκ ἄτοπον ὀλιγάκις,\r\nἡγεμόνα τε προσειπεῖν καὶ ἔθνους ἄρχοντα, καὶ τοῖς εὐλόγως δεομένοις ὅσα\r\nἐνδέχεται βοηθῆσαι.\r\n\r\n(Now if we were pure soul alone, and our bodies did not hinder us in any\r\nrespect, it would be well to prescribe one sort of life for priests. But\r\nsince what he should practise when on duty concerns the individual priest\r\nalone, not priests absolutely, what should we concede to a man who has\r\nreceived the office of priest, on occasions when he is not actually\r\nengaged in service in the temples? I think that a priest ought to keep\r\nhimself pure from all contamination, for a night and a day, and then after\r\npurifying himself for another night following on the first, with such\r\nrites of purification as the sacred laws prescribe, he should under these\r\nconditions enter the temple and remain there for as many days as the law\r\ncommands. (Thirty is the number with us at Rome, but in other places the\r\nnumber varies.) It is proper then, I think, that he should remain\r\nthroughout all these days in the sacred precincts, devoting himself to\r\nphilosophy, and that he should not enter a house or a market‐place, or see\r\neven a magistrate, except in the precincts, but should concern himself\r\nwith his service to the god, overseeing and arranging everything in\r\nperson; and then, when he has completed the term of days, he should retire\r\nfrom his office in favour of another. And when he turns again to the\r\nordinary life of mankind, he may be allowed to visit a friend’s house,\r\nand, when invited, to attend a feast, but not on the invitation of all but\r\nonly of persons of the highest character. And at this time there would be\r\nnothing out of the way in his going occasionally to the market‐place and\r\nconversing with the governor or the chief magistrate of his tribe, and\r\ngiving aid, as far as lies in his power, to those who have a good reason\r\nfor needing it.)\r\n\r\nΠρέπει δὲ οἶμαι τοῖς ἱερῦσιν ἔνδον μέν, ὅτε λειτουργοῦσιν, ἐσθῆτι χρῆσθαι\r\nμεγαλοπρεπεστάτῃ, τῶν ἱερῶν δὲ ἔξω τῇ συνήθει δίχα πολυτελείας· οὐδὲ γὰρ\r\nεὔλογον τοῖς δεδομένοις ἡμῖν ἐπὶ τιμῇ θεῶν εἰς κενοδοξίαν καταχρῆσθαι καὶ\r\nτύφον μάταιον.

For it is not rational that we should misuse, in empty\r\nconceit and vain ostentation, what has been given to us for the honour of\r\nthe gods. And for this reason we ought in the market place to abstain from\r\ntoo costly dress and from outward show, and in a word from every sort of\r\npretentiousness. For consider how the gods, because they admired the\r\nperfect moderation of Amphiaraus,(534) after they had decreed the\r\ndestruction of that famous army—and he, though he knew that it would be\r\nso, went with the expedition and therefore did not escape his fated\r\nend,—the gods I say transformed him completely from what he had been, and\r\nremoved him to the sphere of the gods. For all the others who were in the\r\nexpedition against Thebes engraved a device on their shields before they\r\nhad conquered the enemy, and erected trophies to celebrate the downfall of\r\nthe Cadmeans; but he, the associate of the gods, when he went to war had\r\narms with no device; but gentleness he had, and moderation, as even the\r\nenemy bore witness. Hence I think that we priests ought to show moderation\r\nin our dress, in order that we may win the goodwill of the gods, since it\r\nis no slight offence that we commit against them when we wear in public\r\nthe sacred dress and make it public property, and in a word give all men\r\nan opportunity to stare at it as though it were something marvellous. For\r\nwhenever this happens, many who are not purified come near us, and by this\r\nmeans the symbols of the gods are polluted. Moreover what lawlessness it\r\nis, what arrogance towards the gods for us ourselves when we are not\r\nliving the priestly life to wear the priestly dress! However, of this too\r\nI shall speak more particularly in another place; and what I am writing to\r\nyou at the moment is only a mere outline of the subject.)\r\n\r\n[B] Τοῖς ἀσελγέσι τούτοις θεάτροις τῶν ἱερέων μηδεὶς μηδαμοῦ παραβαλλέτω\r\nμηδὲ εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν εἰσαγέτω τὴν ἑαυτοῦ· πρέπει γὰρ οὐδαμῶς. καὶ εἰ μὲν\r\nοἷόν τε ἦν ἐξελάσαι παντάπασιν αὐτὰ τῶν θεάτρων, ὥστε αὐτὰ πάλιν ἀποδοῦναι\r\nτῷ Διονύσῳ καθαρὰ γενόμενα, πάντως ἂν ἐπειράθην αὐτὸ προθύμως\r\nκατασκευάσαι.

Indeed if it were possible to banish such shows\r\nabsolutely from the theatres so as to restore to Dionysus those theatres\r\npure as of old, I should certainly have endeavoured with all my heart to\r\nbring this about; but as it is, since I thought that this is impossible,\r\nand that even if it should prove to be possible it would not on other\r\naccounts be expedient, I forebore entirely from this ambition. But I do\r\ndemand that priests should withdraw themselves from the licentiousness of\r\nthe theatres and leave them to the crowd. Therefore let no priest enter a\r\ntheatre or have an actor or a chariot‐driver for his friend; and let no\r\ndancer or mime even approach his door. And as for the sacred games, I\r\npermit anyone who will to attend those only in which women are forbidden\r\nnot only to compete but even to be spectators. With regard to the hunting\r\nshows with dogs which are performed in the cities inside the theatres,\r\nneed I say that not only priests but even the sons of priests must keep\r\naway from them?)\r\n\r\nἮν μὲν οὖν ἴσως πρὸ τούτων εἰρῆσθαι καλόν, ὅθεν καὶ ὅπως χρὴ τοὺς ἱερέας\r\nἀποδεικνύειν· οὐδὲν δὲ ἄτοπον εἰς τοῦτό μοι τοὺς λόγους λῆξαι.

I say that the most upright men in\r\nevery city, by preference those who show most love for the gods, and next\r\nthose who show most love for their fellow men, must be appointed, whether\r\nthey be poor or rich. And in this matter let there be no distinction\r\nwhatever whether they are unknown or well known. For the man who by reason\r\nof his gentleness has not won notice ought not to be barred by reason of\r\nhis want of fame. Even though he be poor and a man of the people, if he\r\npossess within himself these two things, love for God and love for his\r\nfellow men, let him be appointed priest. And a proof of his love for God\r\nis his inducing his own people to show reverence to the gods; a proof of\r\nhis love for his fellows is his sharing cheerfully, even from a small\r\nstore, with those in need, and his giving willingly thereof, and trying to\r\ndo good to as many men as he is able.)\r\n\r\nΠροσεκτέον γὰρ μάλιστα τῷ μέρει τούτῳ, καὶ τὴν ἰατρείαν ἐντεῦθεν ποιητέον.\r\nἐπειδὴ γὰρ οἶμαι συνέβη τοὺς πένητας ἀμελεῖσθαι παρορωμένους ὑπὸ τῶν\r\nἱερέων, [C] οἱ δυσσεβεῖς Γαλιλαῖοι κατανοήσαντες ἐπέθεντο ταύτῃ τῇ\r\nφιλανθρωπίᾳ, καὶ τὸ χείριστον τῶν ἔργων διὰ τοῦ εὐδοκιμοῦντος(536) τῶν\r\nἐπιτηδευμάτων ἐκράτυναν. ὥσπερ γὰρ(537) οἱ τὰ παιδία διὰ τοῦ πλακοῦντος\r\nἐξαπατῶντες τῷ καὶ δὶς καὶ τρὶς προέσθαι πείθουσιν ἀκολουθεῖν ἑαυτοῖς,\r\nεἶθ᾽, ὅταν ἀποστήσωσι πόρρω τῶν οἰκείων, ἐμβάλλοντες εἰς ναῦν ἀπέδοντο,\r\nκαὶ γέγονεν εἰς ἅπαντα τὸν ἑξῆς βίον πικρὸν τὸ δόξαν πρὸς ὀλίγον γλυκύ,\r\n[D] τὸν αὐτὸν καὶ αὐτοὶ τρόπον ἀρξάμενοι διὰ τῆς λεγομένης παρ᾽ αὐτοῖς\r\nἀγάπης καὶ ὑποδοχῆς καὶ διακονίας τραπεζῶν· ἔστι γὰρ ὥσπερ τὸ ἔργον, οὕτω\r\nδὲ καὶ τοὔνομα παρ᾽ αὐτοῖς πολύ· πλείστους ἐνήγαγον εἰς τὴν ἀθεότητα....\r\n\r\n(We must pay especial attention to this point, and by this means effect a\r\ncure. For when it came about that the poor were neglected and overlooked\r\nby the priests, then I think the impious Galilaeans observed this fact and\r\ndevoted themselves to philanthropy. And they have gained ascendancy in the\r\nworst of their deeds through the credit they win for such practices. For\r\njust as those who entice children with a cake, and by throwing it to them\r\ntwo or three times induce them to follow them, and then, when they are far\r\naway from their friends cast them on board a ship and sell them as slaves,\r\nand that which for the moment seemed sweet, proves to be bitter for all\r\nthe rest of their lives—by the same method, I say, the Galilaeans also\r\nbegin with their so‐called love‐feast, or hospitality, or service of\r\ntables,—for they have many ways of carrying it out and hence call it by\r\nmany names,—the result is that they have led very many into\r\natheism....(538))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAESARS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Caesars, otherwise entitled in the MSS. Symposium or Kronia (Latin\r\nSaturnalia) was written at Constantinople in 361 and was probably\r\naddressed to Sallust, to whom Julian had sent his lost work the\r\nKronia.(539) The interlocutor in the proœmium(540) is almost certainly\r\nSallust.\r\n\r\n“Caesar” was in Julian’s time a Roman Emperor’s most splendid title, and\r\nwas regularly used by the barbarians when they referred to the Emperor.\r\nThe idea and the working out of the satire is Lucianic and there are\r\nechoes here and there of Lucian’s _Dialogues of the Dead_, but Julian is\r\nneither so witty nor so frivolous as Lucian. In speaking of the gods he\r\nallows himself a licence which is appropriate to the festival, but would\r\notherwise seem inconsistent with the admonitions addressed to priests in\r\nthe _Fragment of a Letter_. His conception of the State and of the ideal\r\nruler is Greek rather than Roman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nΙΟΥΛΙΑΝΟΥ ΑΥΤΟΚΡΑΤΟΡΟΣ\r\n\r\n(Julian, Emperor)\r\n\r\nΣΥΜΠΟΣΙΟΝ Η ΚΡΟΝΙΑ\r\n\r\n(The Caesars)\r\n\r\nἘπειδὴ δίδωσιν ὁ θεὸς παίζειν· ἔστι γὰρ Κρόνια· γελοῖον δὲ οὐδὲν οὐδὲ\r\nτερπνὸν οἶδα ἐγώ, τὸ μὴ καταγέλαστα φράσαι φροντίδος ἔοικεν εἶναι ἄξιον, ὦ\r\nφιλότης.\r\n\r\n(“It is the season of the Kronia,(541) during which the god allows us to\r\nmake merry.

But\r\njust below the moon in the upper air he had decided to entertain the\r\nEmperors. The lightness of the bodies with which they had been invested,\r\nand also the revolution of the moon sustained them. Four couches were\r\nthere made ready for the superior gods. That of Kronos was made of\r\ngleaming ebony, which concealed in its blackness a lustre so intense and\r\ndivine that no one could endure to gaze thereon. For in looking at that\r\nebony, the eyes suffered as much, methinks, from its excess of radiance as\r\nfrom the sun when one gazes too intently at his disc. The couch of Zeus\r\nwas more brilliant than silver, but paler than gold; whether however one\r\nought to call this “electron,”(549) or to give it some other name, Hermes\r\ncould not inform me precisely. On either side of these sat on golden\r\nthrones the mother and daughter, Hera beside Zeus and Rhea beside Kronos.\r\nAs for the beauty of the gods, not even Hermes tried to describe it in his\r\ntale; he said that it transcended description, and must be comprehended by\r\nthe eye of the mind; for in words it was hard to portray and impossible to\r\nconvey to mortal ears. Never indeed will there be or appear an orator so\r\ngifted that he could describe such surpassing beauty as shines forth on\r\nthe countenances of the gods.)\r\n\r\n[B] Παρεσκεύαστο δὲ καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις θεοῖς ἑκάστῳ θρόνος ἢ κλίνη κατὰ\r\nπρεσβείαν. ἤριζε δὲ οὐδείς, ἀλλ᾽ ὅπερ Ὅμηρος ὀρθῶς ποιῶν ἔφη, δοκεῖν μοι\r\nπαρὰ τῶν Μουσῶν αὐτῶν ἀκηκοώς, ἔχειν ἕκαστον τῶν θεῶν θρόνον, ἐφ᾽ οὗ\r\nπάντως αὐτῷ θέμις καθῆσθαι στερεῶς καὶ ἀμετακινήτως· ἐπεὶ καὶ πρὸς τὴν\r\nπαρουσίαν τοῦ πατρὸς ἐξανιστάμενοι ταράττουσιν οὐδαμῶς τὰς καθέδρας οὐδὲ\r\nμεταβαίνουσιν οὐδὲ ὑφαρπάζουσιν ἀλλήλων, [C] γνωρίζει δὲ ἕκαστος τὸ\r\nπροσῆκον αὑτῷ. πάντων οὖν κύκλῳ τῶν θεῶν καθημένων, ὁ Σειληνὸς ἐρωτικῶς\r\nἔχειν μοι δοκῶν τοῦ Διονύσου καλοῦ καὶ νέου καὶ τῷ πατρὶ τῷ Διὶ\r\nπαραπλησίου πλησίον αὐτοῦ, τροφεύς τις οἷα καὶ παιδαγωγός, [D] καθῆστο, τά\r\nτε ἄλλα φιλοπαίγμονα καὶ φιλόγελων καὶ χαριτοδότην(550) ὄντα τὸν θεὸν\r\nεὐφραίνων καὶ δὴ καὶ τῷ σκώπτειν τὰ πολλὰ καὶ γελοιάζειν.\r\n\r\n(For the other gods had been prepared a throne or couch, for everyone\r\naccording to seniority.

Now\r\nwhen the gods were seated in a circle, Silenus, amorous, methinks, of\r\nDionysus ever fair and ever young, who sat close to Zeus his father, took\r\nhis seat next to him on the pretext that he had brought him up and was his\r\ntutor. And since Dionysus loves jesting and laughter and is the giver of\r\nthe Graces, Silenus diverted the god with a continual flow of sarcasms and\r\njests, and in other ways besides.)\r\n\r\nὩς δὲ καὶ τὸ τῶν καισάρων συνεκεκρότητο(552) συμπόσιον, εἰσῄει πρῶτος\r\nἸούλιος Καῖσαρ, ὑπὸ φιλοτιμίας αὐτῷ βουλόμενος ἐρίσαι τῷ Διὶ περὶ τῆς\r\nμοναρχίας, εἰς ὃν ὁ Σειληνὸς βλέψας, Ὅρα, εἶπεν, ὦ Ζεῦ, μή σε ὁ ἀνὴρ οὗτος\r\nὑπὸ φιλαρχίας ἀφελέσθαι καὶ τὴν βασιλείαν διανοηθῇ. καὶ γὰρ, ὡς ὁρᾷς, ἐστὶ\r\nμέγας καὶ καλός· ἐμοὶ γοῦν, εἰ καὶ μηδὲν ἄλλο, [309] τὰ γοῦν περὶ τὴν\r\nκεφαλὴν ἐστι προσόμοιος. παίζοντος ἔτι τοιαῦτα τοῦ Σειληνοῦ καὶ τῶν θεῶν\r\nοὐ σφόδρα προσεχόντων αὐτῷ, Ὀκταβιανὸς ἐπεισέρχεται πολλὰ ἀμείβων, ὥσπερ\r\nοἱ χαμαιλέοντες, χρώματα καὶ νῦν μὲν ὠχριῶν, αὖθις δὲ ἐρυθρὸς γινόμενος,\r\nεἶτα μέλας καὶ ζοφώδης καὶ συννεφής· [B] ἀνίετο δ᾽ αὖθις εἰς Ἀφροδίτην καὶ\r\nΧάριτας, εἶναί τε ἤθελε τὰς βολὰς τῶν ὀμμάτων ὁποῖός ἐστιν ὁ μέγας Ἥλιος·\r\nοὐδένα γάρ οἱ τῶν ἀπαντώντων(553) ἀντιβλέπειν ἠξίου. καὶ ὁ Σειληνός,\r\nΒαβαί, ἔφη, τοῦ παντοδαποῦ τούτου θηρίου· τί ποτ᾽ ἄρα δεινὸν ἡμᾶς\r\nἐργάσεται; Παῦσαι, εἴπε, ληρῶν, ὁ Ἀπόλλων· ἐγὼ γὰρ αὐτὸν τουτῳὶ Ζήνωνι\r\nπαραδοὺς αὐτίκα ὑμῖν ἀποφανῶ χρυσὸν ἀκήρατον. [C] ἀλλ᾽ ἴθι, εἶπεν, ὦ\r\nΖήνων, ἐπιμελήθητι τοὐμοῦ θρέμματος. ὁ δὲ ὑπακούσας, εἶτα ἐπᾴσας αὐτῷ\r\nμικρὰ τῶν δογμάτων, ὥσπερ οἱ τὰς Ζαμόλξιδος ἐπῳδὰς θρυλοῦντες, ἀπέφηνεν\r\nἄνδρα ἔμφρονα καὶ σώφρονα.\r\n\r\n(When the banquet had been arranged for the Emperors also, Julius Caesar\r\nentered first, and such was his passion for glory that he seemed ready to\r\ncontend with Zeus himself for dominion. Whereupon Silenus observing him\r\nsaid, “Take care, Zeus, lest this man in his lust for power be minded to\r\nrob you of your empire. He is, as you see, tall and handsome, and if he\r\nresembles me in nothing else, round about his head he is very like\r\nme.”(554) While Silenus, to whom the gods paid very little attention, was\r\njesting thus, Octavian entered, changing colour continually, like a\r\nchameleon, turning now pale now red; one moment his expression was gloomy,\r\nsombre, and overcast, the next he unbent and showed all the charms of\r\nAphrodite and the Graces. Moreover in the glances of his eyes he was fain\r\nto resemble mighty Helios, for he preferred that none who approached\r\nshould be able to meet his gaze.(555) “Good Heavens!” exclaimed Silenus,\r\n“what a changeable monster is this! What mischief will he do us?” “Cease\r\ntrifling,” said Apollo, “after I have handed him over to Zeno(556) here, I\r\nshall transform him for you straightway to gold without alloy. Come,\r\nZeno,” he cried, “take charge of my nursling.” Zeno obeyed, and thereupon,\r\nby reciting over Octavian a few of his doctrines,(557) in the fashion of\r\nthose who mutter the incantations of Zamolxis,(558) he made him wise and\r\ntemperate.)\r\n\r\nΤρίτος ἐπεισέδραμεν αὐτοῖς Τιβέριος σεμνὸς τὰ πρόσωπα καὶ βλοσυρός, σῶφρόν\r\nτε ἅμα καὶ πολεμικὸν βλέπων. ἐπιστραφέντος δὲ πρὸς τὴν καθέδραν ὤφθησαν\r\nὠτειλαὶ κατὰ τὸν νῶτον μυρίαι, καυτῆρές τινες [D] καὶ ξέσματα καὶ πληγαὶ\r\nχαλεπαὶ καὶ μώλωπες ὑπό τε ἀκολασίας καὶ ὠμότητος ψῶραί τινες καὶ λειχῆνες\r\nοἷον ἐγκεκαυμέναι. εἶθ᾽ ὁ Σειληνός\r\n\r\n(The third to hasten in was Tiberius, with countenance solemn and grim,\r\nand an expression at once sober and martial. But as he turned to sit down\r\nhis back was seen to be covered with countless scars, burns, and sores,\r\npainful welts and bruises, while ulcers and abscesses were as though\r\nbranded thereon, the result of his self‐indulgent and cruel life.(559)\r\nWhereupon Silenus cried out,)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ἀλλοῖός μοι, ξεῖνε, φάνης νέον ἢ τὸ πάροιθεν\r\n\r\n    (“Far different, friend, thou appearest now than before,”(560))\r\n\r\n\r\nεἰπὼν ἔδοξεν αὑτοῦ φαίνεσθαι σπουδαιότερος. καὶ ὁ Διόνυσος πρὸς αὐτόν, Τί\r\nδῆτα, εἶπεν, ὦ παππίδιον σπουδάζεις; καὶ ὅς, Ἐξέπληξέ με ὁ γέρων οὑτοσί, ὁ\r\nΣάτυρος, ἔφη, καὶ πεποίηκεν ἐκλαθόμενον ἐμαυτοῦ τὰς Ὁμηρικὰς προβαλέσθαι\r\nμούσας.

So Silenus had no chance to say\r\nanything about him. But when Claudius came in Silenus began to sing some\r\nverses from the _Knights_ of Aristophanes,(565) toadying Claudius, as it\r\nseemed, instead of Demos. Then he looked at Quirinus and said, “Quirinus,\r\nit is not kind of you to invite your descendant to a banquet without his\r\nfreedmen Narcissus and Pallas.(566) Come,” he went on, “send and fetch\r\nthem, and please send too for his spouse Messalina, for without them this\r\nfellow is like a lay‐figure in a tragedy, I might almost say\r\nlifeless.”(567) While Silenus was speaking Nero entered, lyre in hand and\r\nwearing a wreath of laurel. Whereupon Silenus turned to Apollo and said,\r\n“You see he models himself on you.” “I will soon take off that wreath,”\r\nreplied Apollo, “for he does not imitate me in all things, and even when\r\nhe does he does it badly.” Then his wreath was taken off and Cocytus\r\ninstantly swept him away.)\r\n\r\n[D] Ἐπὶ τούτῳ πολλοὶ καὶ παντοδαποὶ συνέτρεχον, Βίνδικες, Γάλβαι, Ὄθωνες,\r\nΒιτέλλιοι. καὶ ὁ Σειληνός, Τούτων, εἶπε, τῶν μονάρχων τὸ σμῆνος(568) πόθεν\r\nἐξηυρήκατε, ὦ θεοί; τυφόμεθα γοῦν ὑπὸ τοῦ καπνοῦ· φείδεται γὰρ οὐδὲ τῶν\r\nἀνακτόρων ταυτὶ τὰ θηρία. καὶ ὁ Ζεὺς ἀπιδὼν πρὸς τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὑτοῦ [311]\r\nΣάραπιν καὶ τὸν Οὐεσπασιανὸν δείξας, Πέμπε, εἶπε, τὸν σμικρίνην· τοῦτον\r\nἀπὸ τῆς Αἰγύπτου ταχέως, ἵνα τὴν φλόγα ταύτην κατασβέσῃ· τῶν παίδων δὲ τὸν\r\nπρεσβύτερον μὲν παίζειν κέλευε μετὰ τῆς Ἀφροδίτης τῆς πανδήμου, τὸν\r\nνεώτερον δὲ τῷ Σικελικῷ θηρίῳ παραπλησίως κλοιῷ δῆσον. παρῆλθεν ἐπὶ\r\nτούτοις γέρων ὀφθῆναι καλός· λάμπει γὰρ ἔστιν ὅτε καὶ ἐν τῷ γήρᾳ τὸ\r\nκάλλος· ἐντυχεῖν πρᾳότατος, χρηματίσαι δικαιότατος.

We are being suffocated with their\r\nsmoke; for brutes of this sort spare not even the temple of the\r\ngods.”(569) Then Zeus turned to his brother Serapis, and pointing to\r\nVespasian said, “Send this niggard from Egypt forthwith to extinguish the\r\nflames. As for his sons, bid the eldest(570) sport with Aphrodite Pandemos\r\nand chain the younger(571) in the stocks like the Sicilian monster.”(572)\r\nNext entered an old man,(573) beautiful to behold; for even old age can be\r\nradiantly beautiful. Very mild were his manners, most just his dealings.\r\nIn Silenus he inspired such awe that he fell silent. “What!” said Hermes,\r\n“have you nothing to say to us about this man?” “Yes, by Zeus,” he\r\nreplied, “I blame you gods for your unfairness in allowing that blood‐\r\nthirsty monster to rule for fifteen years, while you granted this man\r\nscarce one whole year.” “Nay,” said Zeus, “do not blame us. For I will\r\nbring in many virtuous princes to succeed him.” Accordingly Trajan entered\r\nforthwith, carrying on his shoulders the trophies of his wars with the\r\nGetae and the Parthians. Silenus, when he saw him, said in a whisper which\r\nhe meant to be heard, “Now is the time for Zeus our master to look out, if\r\nhe wants to keep Ganymede for himself.”)\r\n\r\nΜετὰ τοῦτον ἐπεισέρχεται βαθεῖαν ἔχων τὴν ὑπήνην ἀνὴρ σοβαρὸς τά τε ἄλλα\r\n[D] καὶ δὴ καὶ μουσικὴν ἐργαζόμενος, εἴς τε τὸν οὐρανὸν ἀφορῶν πολλάκις\r\nκαὶ πολυπραγμονῶν τὰ ἀπόρρητα. τοῦτον δὲ ἰδὼν ὁ Σειληνὸς ἔφη, Τί δὲ ὑμῖν\r\nοὗτος ὁ σοφιστὴς δοκεῖ; μῶν Ἀντίνοον τῇδε περισκοπεῖ; φρασάτω τις αὐτῷ μὴ\r\nπαρεῖναι τὸ μειράκιον ἐνθαδὶ καὶ παυσάτω τοῦ λήρου καὶ τῆς φλυαρίας αὐτόν.\r\n[312] ἐπὶ τούτοις ἀνὴρ εἰσέρχεται σώφρων, οὐ τὰ ἐς Ἀφροδίτην, ἀλλὰ τὰ ἐς\r\nτὴν πολιτείαν. ἰδὼν αὐτὸν ὁ Σειληνὸς ἔφη, Βαβαὶ τῆς σμικρολογίας· εἷς\r\nεἶναί μοι δοκεῖ τῶν διαπριόντων τὸ κύμινον ὁ πρεσβύτης οὗτος.\r\nἐπεισελθούσης δὲ αὐτῷ τῆς τῶν ἀδελφῶν ξυνωρίδος, Βήρου καὶ Λουκίου, δεινῶς\r\nὁ Σειληνὸς συνεστάλη, παίζειν γὰρ οὐκ εἶχεν οὐδ᾽ ἐπισκώπτειν, μάλιστα τὸν\r\nΒῆρον, καίτοι καὶ τούτου τὰ περὶ τὸν οἱὸν καὶ τὴν γυναῖκα πολυπραγμονῶν\r\nἁμαρτήματα, [B] τὴν μὲν ὅτι πλέον ἢ προσῆκεν ἐπένθησεν, ἄλλως τε οὐδὲ\r\nκοσμίαν οὖσαν, τῷ δὲ ὅτι τὴν ἀρχὴν συναπολλυμένην περιεῖδεν, ἔχων καὶ\r\nταῦτα σπουδαῖον κηδεστήν, ὃς τῶν τε κοινῶν ἂν προύστη κρεῖττον καὶ δὴ καὶ\r\nτοῦ παιδὸς αὐτοῦ βέλτιον ἂν ἐπεμελήθη ἢ αὐτὸς αὑτοῦ. καίπερ οὖν ταῦτα\r\nπολυπραγμονῶν ᾐδεῖτο τὸ μέγεθος αὐτοῦ τῆς ἀρετῆς· τόν γε μὴν υἱέα οὐδὲ [C]\r\nτοῦ σκωφθῆναι νομίσας ἄξιον ἀφῆκεν· ἔπιπτε γὰρ καὶ αὐτὸς εἰς γῆν οὐ\r\nδυνάμενος ἵστασθαι(574) καὶ παρομαρτεῖν τοῖς ἥρωσιν.\r\n\r\n(Next entered an austere‐looking man(575) with a long beard, an adept in\r\nall the arts, but especially music, one who was always gazing at the\r\nheavens and prying into hidden things. Silenus when he saw him said, “What\r\nthink ye of this sophist? Can he be looking here for Antinous? One of you\r\nshould tell him that the youth is not here, and make him cease from his\r\nmadness and folly.” Thereupon entered a man(576) of temperate character, I\r\ndo not say in love affairs but in affairs of state. When Silenus caught\r\nsight of him he exclaimed, “Bah! Such fussing about trifles! This old man\r\nseems to me the sort of person who would split cumin seed.”(577) Next\r\nentered the pair of brothers, Verus(578) and Lucius.(579) Silenus scowled\r\nhorribly because he could not jeer or scoff at them, especially not at\r\nVerus; but he would not ignore his errors of judgment in the case of his\r\nson(580) and his wife,(581) in that he mourned the latter beyond what was\r\nbecoming, especially considering that she was not even a virtuous woman;\r\nand he failed to see that his son was ruining the empire as well as\r\nhimself, and that though Verus had an excellent son‐in‐law who would have\r\nadministered the state better, and besides would have managed the youth\r\nbetter than he could manage himself. But though he refused to ignore these\r\nerrors he reverenced the exalted virtue of Verus. His son however he\r\nconsidered not worth even ridicule and so let him pass. Indeed he fell to\r\nearth of his own accord because he could not keep on his feet or accompany\r\nthe heroes.)\r\n\r\nἘπεισέρχεται Περτίναξ τῷ συμποσίῳ τὴν σφαγὴν ὀδυρόμενος. ἡ Δίκη δὲ αὐτὸν\r\nκατελεήσασα, Ἀλλ᾽ οὐ χαιρήσουσιν, εἶπεν, οἱ τούτων αἴτιοι· καὶ σὺ δέ, ὦ\r\nΠερτίναξ, ἠδίκεις κοινωνῶν τῆς ἐπιβουλῆς, ὅσον ἐπὶ τοῖς σκέμμασιν, ἣν ὁ\r\nΜάρκου παῖς ἐπεβουλεύθη.

But\r\nJustice took pity on him and said, “Nay, the authors of this deed shall\r\nnot long exult. But Pertinax, you too were guilty, since at least so far\r\nas conjecture went you were privy to the plot that was aimed at the son of\r\nMarcus.” Next came Severus, a man of excessively harsh temper and\r\ndelighting to punish. “Of him,” said Silenus, “I have nothing to say, for\r\nI am terrified by his forbidding and implacable looks.” When his sons\r\nwould have entered with him, Minos kept them at a distance. However, when\r\nhe had clearly discerned their characters, he let the younger(585) pass,\r\nbut sent away the elder(586) to atone for his crimes. Next Macrinus,\r\nassassin and fugitive, and after him the pretty boy from Emesa(587) were\r\ndriven far away from the sacred enclosure. But Alexander the Syrian sat\r\ndown somewhere in the lowest ranks and loudly lamented his fate.(588)\r\nSilenus made fun of him and exclaimed, “O fool and madman! Exalted as you\r\nwere you could not govern your own family, but gave your revenues to your\r\nmother:(589) nor could you be persuaded how much better it was to bestow\r\nthem on your friends than to hoard them.” “I however,” said Justice, “will\r\nconsign to torment all who were accessory to his death.” And then the\r\nyouth was left in peace. Next entered Gallienus and his father,(590) the\r\nlatter still dragging the chains of his captivity, the other with the\r\ndress and languishing gait of a woman. Seeing Valerian, Silenus cried,)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Τίς οὗτος ὁ λευκολόφας,\r\n    Πρόπαρ ὃς ἡγεῖται στρατοῦ;\r\n\r\n    (“Who is this with the white plume that leads the army’s\r\n    van?”(591))\r\n\r\n\r\nἔφη, πρὸς δὲ τὸν Γαλλιῆνον,\r\n\r\n(Then he greeted Gallienus with,)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ὃς καὶ χρυσὸν ἔχων πάντη τρυφᾷ ἠύτε κούρη·\r\n\r\n    (“He who is all decked with gold and dainty as a maiden.”(592))\r\n\r\n\r\nτούτω δὲ ὁ Ζεὺς εἶπε τῆς ἐκεῖσε θοίνης ἐκβῆναι.\r\n\r\n(But Zeus ordered the pair to depart from the feast.)\r\n\r\n[D] Τούτοις ἐπεισέρχεται Κλαύδιος, εἰς ὃν ἀπιδόντες οἱ θεοὶ πάντες\r\nἠγάσθησάν τε αὐτὸν τῆς μεγαλοψυχίας καὶ ἐπένευσαν αὐτοῦ τῷ γένει τὴν\r\nἀρχήν, δίκαιον εἶναι νομίσαντες οὕτω φιλοπάτριδος ἀνδρὸς ἐπὶ πλεῖστον\r\nεἶναι τὸ γένος ἐν ἡγεμονίᾳ. τούτοις ἐπεισέδραμεν Αὐρηλιανὸς ὥσπερ\r\nἀποδιδράσκων τοὺς εἴργοντας αὐτὸν παρὰ τῷ Μίνωι· πολλαὶ γὰρ αὐτῷ\r\nσυνίσταντο δίκαι τῶν ἀδίκων φόνων, καὶ ἔφευγε τὰς γραφὰς κακῶς\r\nἀπολογούμενας.

Then Aurelian came rushing in as though trying\r\nto escape from those who would detain him before the judgment seat of\r\nMinos. For many charges of unjustifiable murders were brought against him,\r\nand he was in flight because he could ill defend himself against the\r\nindictments.

Since he had\r\nbeen unjustly treated by impious men the gods paid him honours, and\r\nmoreover exacted the penalty from his assassins. For all that, Silenus\r\ntried to jest at his expense, though many of the gods urged him to be\r\nsilent. In spite of them he called out, “Now let those that follow him\r\nlearn wisdom from his example. Probus, do you not know that when\r\nphysicians give bitter medicines they mix them with honey?(596) But you\r\nwere always too austere and harsh and never displayed toleration. And so\r\nyour fate, though unjust, was natural enough. For no one can govern horses\r\nor cattle or mules, still less men, unless he sometimes yields to them and\r\ngratifies their wishes; just as physicians humour their patients in\r\ntrifles so that they may make them obey in things more essential.” “What\r\nnow, little father,” exclaimed Dionysus, “have you turned up as our\r\nphilosopher?” “Why, my son,” he replied, “did I not make a philosopher of\r\nyou? Do you not know that Socrates also, who was so like me,(597) carried\r\noff the prize for philosophy from his contemporaries, at least if you\r\nbelieve that your brother(598) tells the truth? So you must allow me to be\r\nserious on occasion and not always jocose.”)\r\n\r\n[315] Ἔτι διαλεγομένων αὐτῶν πρὸς ἀλλήλους, ὄ τε Κᾶρος ἅμα τοῖς παισὶν\r\nεἰσφρῆσαι βουληθεὶς εἰς τὸ συμπόσιον ἀπελήλατο παρὰ τῆς Δίκης, καὶ ὁ\r\nΔιοκλητιανός, ἄγων μεθ᾽ ἑαυτοῦ Μαξιμιανώ τε τὼ δύο καὶ τὸν ἐμὸν πάππον\r\nΚωνστάντιον, ἐν κόσμῳ προῆγεν. εἴχοντο δὲ ἀλλήλων τὼ χεῖρε, καὶ ἐβάδιζον\r\nοὐκ ἐξ ἴσης, ἀλλ᾽ οἷα χορός τις ἦν περὶ αὐτόν, [B] τῶν μὲν ὥσπερ\r\nδορυφορούντων καὶ προθεῖν αὐτοῦ βουλομένων, τοῦ δὲ εἴργοντος· οὐδὲν γὰρ\r\nἠξίου πλεονεκτεῖν. ὡς δὲ ξυνίει κάμνοντος ἑαυτοῦ, δοὺς αὐτοῖς ἅπαντα, ὅσα\r\nἔφερεν ἐπὶ τῶν ὤμων, αὐτὸς εὔλυτος ἐβάδιζεν. ἠγάσθησαν οἱ θεοὶ τῶν ἀνδρῶν\r\nτὴν ὁμόνοιαν, καὶ ἐπέτρεψαν αὐτοῖς πρὸ πολλῶν πάνυ καθῆσθαι. δεινῶς δὲ\r\nὄντα τὸν Μαξιμιανὸν ἀκόλαστον ὁ Σειληνὸς ἐπισκώπτειν μὲν οὐκ ἠξίου, [C] τὸ\r\nδὲ τῶν βασιλέων οὐκ εἰσεδέχετο συσσίτιον. οὐ γὰρ μόνον τὰ εἰς Ἀφροδίτην ἦν\r\nπαντοίαν ἀσέλγειαν ἀσελγής, ἀλλὰ καὶ φιλοπράγμων καὶ ἄπιστος καὶ οὐ τὰ\r\nπάντα τῷ τετραχόρδῳ συνῳδῶν. ἐξήλασεν οὖν αὐτὸν ἡ Δίκη ταχέως. εἶτα\r\nἀπῆλθεν οὐκ οἶδα ὅποι γῆς· ἐπελαθόμην γὰρ αὐτὸ παρὰ τοῦ Ἑρμοῦ\r\nπολυπραγμονῆσαι. τούτῳ δὲ τῷ παναρμονίῳ τετραχόρδῳ παραφύεται δεινὸν καὶ\r\nτραχὺ καὶ ταραχῶδες σύστημα.

Next Diocletian advanced in pomp,\r\nbringing with him the two Maximians and my grandfather Constantius.(599)\r\nThese latter held one another by the hand and did not walk alongside of\r\nDiocletian, but formed a sort of chorus round him. And when they wished to\r\nrun before him as a bodyguard he prevented them, since he did not think\r\nhimself entitled to more privileges than they. But when he realised that\r\nhe was growing weary he gave over to them all the burdens that he carried\r\non his shoulders, and thereafter walked with greater ease. The gods\r\nadmired their unanimity and permitted them to sit far in front of many of\r\ntheir predecessors. Maximian was so grossly intemperate that Silenus\r\nwasted no jests on him, and he was not allowed to join the emperors at\r\ntheir feast. For not only did he indulge in vicious passions of all sorts,\r\nbut proved meddlesome and disloyal and often introduced discord into that\r\nharmonious quartette. Justice therefore banished him without more ado. So\r\nhe went I know not whither, for I forgot to interrogate Hermes on this\r\npoint. However into that harmonious symphony of four there crept a\r\nterribly harsh and discordant strain. For this reason Justice would not\r\nsuffer the two(600) so much as to approach the door of that assembly of\r\nheroes. As for Licinius, he came as far as the door, but as his misdeeds\r\nwere many and monstrous Minos forthwith drove him away. Constantine\r\nhowever entered and sat some time, and then came his sons.(601)\r\nMagnentius(602) was refused admission because he had never done anything\r\nreally laudable, though much that he achieved had the appearance of merit.\r\nSo the gods, who perceived that these achievements were not based on any\r\nvirtuous principle, sent him packing, to his deep chagrin.)\r\n\r\nΟὔσης δὴ τοιαύτης τῆς ἀμφὶ τὸ δεῖπνον παρασκευῆς, ἐπόθουν μὲν οὐδὲν οἱ\r\nθεοί, πάντα γὰρ ἔχουσιν, αὐτῶν δὲ τῶν ἡρώων ἐδόκει τῷ Ἑρμῇ διαπειρᾶσθαι,\r\nκαὶ τῷ Διὶ τοῦτο οὐκ ἀπὸ γνώμης ἦν. ἐδεῖτο δὲ καὶ ὁ Κυρῖνος ἤδη τινὰ\r\nμετάγειν ἐκεῖθεν παρ᾽ ἑαυτόν.

Then Hermes proposed to examine the\r\nheroes personally and Zeus was of the same mind. Quirinus thereupon begged\r\nthat he might summon one of their number to his side. “Quirinus,” said\r\nHeracles, “I will not have it. For why did you not invite to the feast my\r\nbeloved Alexander also? Zeus, if you are minded to introduce into our\r\npresence any of these Emperors, send, I beg of you, for Alexander. For if\r\nwe are to examine into the merits of men generally, why do we not throw\r\nopen the competition to the better man?” Zeus considered that what the son\r\nof Alcmena said was only just. So Alexander joined the company of heroes,\r\nbut neither Caesar nor anyone else yielded his place to him. However he\r\nfound and took a vacant seat which the son(604) of Severus had taken for\r\nhimself—he had been expelled for fratricide. Then Silenus began to rally\r\nQuirinus and said, “See now whether all these Romans can match this one\r\nGreek.”(605) “By Zeus,” retorted Quirinus, “I consider that many of them\r\nare as good as he! It is true that my descendants have admired him so much\r\nthat they hold that he alone of all foreign generals is worthy to be\r\nstyled ‘the Great.’ But it does not follow that they think him greater\r\nthan their own heroes; which may be due to national prejudice, but again\r\nthey may be right. However, that we shall very soon find out by examining\r\nthese men.” Even as he spoke Quirinus was blushing, and was evidently\r\nextremely anxious on behalf of his descendants and feared that they might\r\ncome off with the second prize.)\r\n\r\n[317] Μετὰ τοῦτο ὁ Ζεὺς ἤρετο τοὺς θεούς, πότερον χρὴ πάντας ἐπὶ τὸν ἀγῶνα\r\nκαλεῖν ἤ, καθάπερ ἐν τοῖς γυμνικοῖς ἀγῶσι γίνεται, ὁ τοῦ πολλὰς ἀνελομένου\r\nνίκας κρατήσας, ἑνὸς περιγενόμενος, οὐδὲν ἔλαττον δοκεῖ κἀκείνων γεγονέναι\r\nκρείσσων, οἳ προσεπάλαισαν μὲν οὐδαμῶς αὐτῷ, τοῦ κρατηθέντος δὲ ἥττους\r\nἐγένοντο. καὶ ἐδόκει πᾶσιν ἡ τοιαύτη σφόδρα ἐμμελῶς ἔχειν ἐξέτασις.

Ἑρμῆς δὲ ἐκήρυττεν·\r\n\r\n(Then Zeus asked the gods whether it would be better to summon all the\r\nEmperors to enter the lists, or whether they should follow the custom of\r\nathletic contests, which is that he who defeats the winner of many\r\nvictories, though he overcome only that one competitor is held thereby to\r\nhave proved himself superior to all who have been previously defeated, and\r\nthat too though they have not wrestled with the winner, but only shown\r\nthemselves inferior to an antagonist who has been defeated. All the gods\r\nagreed that this was a very suitable sort of test. Hermes then summoned\r\nCaesar to appear before them, then Octavian, and thirdly Trajan, as being\r\nthe greatest warriors. In the silence that followed, Kronos turned to Zeus\r\nand said that he was astonished to see that only martial Emperors were\r\nsummoned to the competition, and not a single philosopher. “For my part,”\r\nhe added, “I like philosophers just as well. So tell Marcus(608) to come\r\nin too.” Accordingly Marcus was summoned and came in looking excessively\r\ndignified and showing the effect of his studies in the expression of his\r\neyes and his lined brows. His aspect was unutterably beautiful from the\r\nvery fact that he was careless of his appearance and unadorned by art; for\r\nhe wore a very long beard, his dress was plain and sober, and from lack of\r\nnourishment his body was very shining and transparent, like light most\r\npure and stainless. When he too had entered the sacred enclosure, Dionysus\r\nsaid, “King Kronos and Father Zeus, can any incompleteness exist among the\r\ngods?” And when they replied that it could not, “Then,” said he, “let us\r\nbring in here some votary of pleasure as well.” “Nay,” answered Zeus, “it\r\nis not permitted that any man should enter here who does not model himself\r\non us.” “In that case,” said Dionysus, “let them be tried at the entrance.\r\nLet us summon by your leave a man not unwarlike but a slave to pleasure\r\nand enjoyment. Let Constantine come as far as the door.” When this had\r\nbeen agreed upon, opinions were offered as to the manner in which they\r\nwere to compete. Hermes thought that everyone ought to speak for himself\r\nin turn, and then the gods should vote. But Apollo did not approve of this\r\nplan, because he said the gods ought to test and examine the truth and not\r\nplausible rhetoric and the devices of the orator. Zeus wished to please\r\nthem both and at the same time to prolong the assembly, so he said, “There\r\nis no harm in letting them speak if we measure them a small allowance of\r\nwater,(609) and then later on we can cross‐examine them and test the\r\ndisposition of each one.” Whereupon Silenus said sardonically, “Take care,\r\nor Trajan and Alexander will think it is nectar and drink up all the water\r\nand leave none for the others.” “It was not my water,” retorted Poseidon,\r\n“but your vines that these two were fond of. So you had better tremble for\r\nyour vines rather than for my springs.” Silenus was greatly piqued and had\r\nno answer ready, but thereafter turned his attention to the disputants.\r\nThen Hermes made this proclamation:)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ἄρχει μὲν ἀγὼν\r\n    τῶν καλλίστων\r\n    ἄθλων ταμίας,\r\n    καιρὸς δὲ καλεῖ\r\n    μηκέτι μέλλειν.\r\n    ἀλλὰ κλύοντες\r\n    τὰν ἁμετέραν\r\n    [319] κήρυκα βοὰν\r\n    οἱ πρὶν βασιλῆς,\r\n    ἔθνεα πολλὰ\r\n    δουλωσάμενοι\r\n    καὶ πολέμοισι\r\n    δάιον ἔγχος\r\n    θήξαντες, ὁμοῦ\r\n    γνώμης τε μέγαν\r\n    πινυτόφρονα νοῦν,\r\n    ἴτ᾽, ἐς ἀντίπαλον\r\n    [B] ἵστασθε κρίσιν,\r\n    οἷς τε φρόνησιν\r\n    τέλος ὀλβίστης\r\n    θέσθαι βιοτῆς,\r\n    οἷς τ᾽ ἀντιβίους\r\n    κακὰ πόλλ᾽ ἔρχαι\r\n    καὶ χρηστὰ φίλους\r\n    τέκμαρ βιότου\r\n    νενόμιστο καλοῦ,\r\n    οἷς θ᾽ ἡδίστην\r\n    ἀπόλαυσιν ἔχειν\r\n    [C] τέρματα μόχθων\r\n    δαῖτας τε γάμους τ᾽,\r\n    ὄμμασι τερπνά,\r\n    μαλακάς τε φέρειν\r\n    ἐσθῆτας ὁμοῦ\r\n    λιθοκολλήτοις\r\n    περὶ χεῖρας ἄκρας\r\n    ψελίοισι φάνη\r\n    μακαριστότατον.\r\n    νίκης δὲ τέλος\r\n    Ζηνὶ μελήσει.\r\n\r\n    (“The trial that begins\r\n    Awards to him who wins\r\n    The fairest prize to‐day.\r\n    And lo, the hour is here\r\n    And summons you.

This made him triumphant and prouder than before. But the effect on\r\nAlexander was that he almost withdrew from the competition, had not mighty\r\nHeracles encouraged him and prevented him from leaving. Alexander drew the\r\nlot to speak second, but the lots of those who came next coincided with\r\nthe order in which they had lived. Caesar then began as follows: “It was\r\nmy fortune, O Zeus and ye other gods, to be born, following a number of\r\ngreat men, in a city so illustrious that she rules more subjects than any\r\nother city has ever ruled; and indeed other cities are well pleased to\r\nrank as second to her.(614) What other city, I ask, began with three\r\nthousand citizens and in less than six centuries carried her victorious\r\narms to the ends of the earth? What other nations ever produced so many\r\nbrave and warlike men or such lawgivers? What nation ever honoured the\r\ngods as they did? Observe then that, though I was born in a city so\r\npowerful and so illustrious, my achievements not only surpassed the men of\r\nmy own day, but all the heroes who ever lived. As for my fellow‐citizens I\r\nam confident that there is none who will challenge my superiority. But if\r\nAlexander here is so presumptuous, which of his deeds does he pretend to\r\ncompare with mine? His Persian conquests, perhaps, as though he had never\r\nseen all those trophies that I gathered when I defeated Pompey! And pray,\r\nwho was the more skilful general, Darius or Pompey? Which of them led the\r\nbravest troops? Pompey had in his army the most martial of the nations\r\nformerly subject to Darius,(615) but he reckoned them no better than\r\nCarians,(616) for he led also those European forces which had often\r\nrepulsed all Asia when she invaded Europe, aye and he had the bravest of\r\nthem all, Italians, Illyrians, and Celts. And since I have mentioned the\r\nCelts, shall we compare the exploits of Alexander against the Getae with\r\nmy conquest of Gaul? He crossed the Danube once, I crossed the Rhine\r\ntwice. The German conquest again is all my doing. No one opposed\r\nAlexander, but I had to contend against Ariovistus. I was the first Roman\r\nwho ventured to sail the outer sea.(617) Perhaps this achievement was not\r\nso wonderful, though it was a daring deed that may well command your\r\nadmiration; but a more glorious action of mine was when I leapt ashore\r\nfrom my ship before all the others.(618) Of the Helvetians and Iberians I\r\nsay nothing. And still I have said not a word about my campaigns in Gaul,\r\nwhen I conquered more than three hundred cities and no less than two\r\nmillion men! But great as were these achievements of mine, that which\r\nfollowed was still greater and more daring. For I had to contend against\r\nmy fellow citizens themselves, and to subdue the invincible, the\r\nunconquerable Romans. Again, if we are judged by the number of our\r\nbattles, I fought three times as many as Alexander, even reckoning by the\r\nboasts of those who embellish his exploits. If one counts the cities\r\ncaptured, I reduced the greatest number, not only in Asia but in Europe as\r\nwell. Alexander only visited Egypt as a sight‐seer, but I conquered her\r\nwhile I was arranging drinking‐parties. Are you pleased to inquire which\r\nof us showed more clemency after victory? I forgave even my enemies, and\r\nfor what I suffered in consequence at their hands Justice has taken\r\nvengeance. But Alexander did not even spare his friends, much less his\r\nenemies. And are you still capable of disputing the first prize with me?\r\nThen since you will not, like the others, yield place to me, you compel me\r\nto say that whereas I was humane towards the Helvetians you treated the\r\nThebans cruelly. You burned their cities to the ground, but I restored the\r\ncities that had been burned by their own inhabitants. And indeed it was\r\nnot at all the same thing to subdue ten thousand Greeks, and to withstand\r\nthe onset of a hundred and fifty thousand men. Much more could I add both\r\nabout myself and Alexander, but I have not had leisure to practise public\r\nspeaking. Wherefore you ought to pardon me, but from what I have said and\r\nwith regard to what I have not said, you ought, forming that decision\r\nwhich equity and justice require, to award me the first prize.”)\r\n\r\nΤοιαῦτα εἰπόντος τοῦ Καίσαρος καὶ λέγειν ἔτι βουλομένου, μόγις καὶ\r\nπρότερον ὁ Ἀλέξανδρος καρτερῶν οὐκέτι κατέσχεν, ἀλλὰ μετά τινος ταραχῆς\r\nκαὶ ἀγωνίας, [B] Ἐγὼ δέ, εἶπεν, ὦ Ζεῦ καὶ θεοί, μέχρι τίνος ἀνέξομαι σιωπῇ\r\nτῆς θρασύτητος τῆς τούτου; πέρας γὰρ οὐδέν ἐστιν, ὡς ὁρᾶτε, οὔτε τῶν εἰς\r\nαὑτὸν ἐπαίνων οὔτε τῶν εἰς ἐμὲ βλασφημιῶν. ἐχρῆν δὲ ἴσως μάλιστα μὲν\r\nἀμφοῖν φείδεσθαι· καί γὰρ εἶναί πως ἀμφότερα δοκεῖ παραπλησίως ἐπαχθῆ·\r\nπλέον δὲ τοῦ τἀμὰ διασύρειν ἄλλως τε καὶ μιμητὴν αὐτῶν γενόμενον. ὁ δὲ εἰς\r\nτοῦτο ἦλθεν ἀναισχυντίας, [C] ὥστε τολμῆσαι τὰ ἀρχέτυπα κωμῳδεῖν τῶν\r\nἑαυτοῦ ἔργων. ἐχρῆν δέ, ὦ Καῖσαρ, ὑπομνησθῆναί σε τῶν δακρύων ἐκείνων, ἃ\r\nτότε ἀφῆκας, ἀκροώμενος τῶν ὑπομνημάτων, ὅσα πεποίηται περὶ τῶν ἐμῶν\r\nπράξεων. ἀλλ᾽ ὁ Πομπήιος ἐπῆρέ σε μετὰ τοῦτο, κολακευθεὶς μὲν παρὰ τῶν\r\nπολιτῶν τῶν ἑαυτοῦ, γενόμενος δὲ οὐδεὶς οὐδαμοῦ.

There is, as you see, no limit to his praise of\r\nhimself or his abuse of me. It would have better become him perhaps to\r\nrefrain from both, since both are alike insupportable, but especially from\r\ndisparaging my conduct, the more since he imitated it. But he has arrived\r\nat such a pitch of impudence that he dares to ridicule the model of his\r\nown exploits. Nay, Caesar, you ought to have remembered those tears you\r\nshed on hearing of the monuments that had been consecrated to my glorious\r\ndeeds.(621) But since then Pompey has inflated you with pride, Pompey who\r\nthough he was the idol of his countrymen was in fact wholly insignificant.\r\nTake his African triumph: that was no great exploit, but the feebleness of\r\nthe consuls in office made it seem glorious. Then the famous Servile\r\nWar(622) was waged not against men but the vilest of slaves, and its\r\nsuccessful issue was due to others, I mean Crassus and Lucius,(623) though\r\nPompey gained the reputation and the credit for it. Again, Armenia and the\r\nneighbouring provinces were conquered by Lucullus,(624) yet for these also\r\nPompey triumphed. Then he became the idol of the citizens and they called\r\nhim ‘the Great.’ Greater, I ask, than whom of his predecessors? What\r\nachievement of his can be compared with those of Marius(625) or of the two\r\nScipios or of Furius,(626) who sits over there by Quirinus because he\r\nrebuilt his city when it was almost in ruins? Those men did not make their\r\nreputation at the expense of others, as happens with public buildings\r\nbuilt at the public expense; I mean that one man lays the foundation,\r\nanother finishes the work, while the last man who is in office though he\r\nhas only whitewashed the walls has his name inscribed on the\r\nbuilding.(627) Not thus, I repeat, did those men gain credit for the deeds\r\nof others. They were themselves the creators and artificers of their\r\nschemes and deserved their illustrious titles. Well then, it is no wonder\r\nthat you vanquished Pompey, who used to scratch his head with his finger‐\r\ntip(628) and in all respects was more of a fox than a lion. When he was\r\ndeserted by Fortune who had so long favoured him, you easily overcame him,\r\nthus unaided. And it is evident that it was not to any superior ability of\r\nyours that you owed your victory, since after running short of\r\nprovisions(629)—no small blunder for a general to make, as I need not tell\r\nyou—you fought a battle and were beaten. And if from imprudence or lack of\r\njudgment or inability to control his countrymen Pompey neither postponed a\r\nbattle when it was his interest to protract the war, nor followed up a\r\nvictory when he had won,(630) it was due to his own errors that he failed,\r\nand not to your strategy.)\r\n\r\nΠέρσαι δὲ πανταχοῦ καλῶς καὶ φρονίμως παρεσκευασμένοι πρὸς τὴν ἡμετέραν\r\nἀλκὴν ἐνέδοσαν. ἐπεὶ δὲ οὐ τοὺ πράττειν ἁπλῶς, ἀλλὰ καὶ τοῦ τὰ δίκαια\r\nπράττειν ἄνδρα ἄριστον καὶ βασιλέα προσήκει μεταποιεῖσθαι, ἐγὼ μὲν ὑπὲρ\r\nτῶν Ἑλλήνων τοὺς Πέρσας ἀπῄτησα δίκην, καὶ τοὺς Ἑλληνικοὺς πολέμους\r\nἐπανειλόμην, οὐχὶ τὴν Ἑλλάδα λυπεῖν βουλόμενος, ἀλλὰ τοὺς κωλύοντάς με\r\nδιαβαίνειν καὶ δίκας ἀπαιτεῖν τὸν Πέρσην ἐπικόπτων.

And since it becomes a\r\nvirtuous man and a king to pride himself not merely on his exploits but\r\nalso on the justice of those exploits, it was on behalf of the Greeks that\r\nI took vengeance on the Persians, and when I made war on the Greeks it was\r\nnot because I wished to injure Greece, but only to chastise those who\r\ntried to prevent me from marching through and from calling the Persians to\r\naccount. You, however, while you subdued the Germans and Gauls were\r\npreparing to fight against your fatherland. What could be worse or more\r\ninfamous? And since you have alluded as though insultingly to ‘ten\r\nthousand Greeks,’ I am aware that you Romans are yourselves descended from\r\nthe Greeks, and that the greater part of Italy was colonised by Greeks;\r\nhowever on that fact I do not insist. But at any rate did not you Romans\r\nthink it very important to have as friends and allies one insignificant\r\ntribe of those very Greeks, I mean the Aetolians, my neighbours? And\r\nlater, when you had gone to war with them for whatever reason, did you not\r\nhave great trouble in making them obey you? Well then, if in the old age,\r\nas one may say, of Greece, you were barely able to reduce not the whole\r\nnation but an insignificant state which was hardly heard of when Greece\r\nwas in her prime, what would have happened to you if you had had to\r\ncontend against the Greeks when they were in full vigour and united? You\r\nknow how cowed you were when Pyrrhus crossed to invade you. And if you\r\nthink the conquest of Persia such a trifle and disparage an achievement so\r\nglorious, tell me why, after a war of more than three hundred years, you\r\nRomans have never conquered a small province beyond the Tigris which is\r\nstill governed by the Parthians? Shall I tell you why? It was the arrows\r\nof the Persians that checked you. Ask Antony to give you an account of\r\nthem, since he was trained for war by you. I, on the other hand, in less\r\nthan ten years conquered not only Persia but India too. After that do you\r\ndare to dispute the prize with me, who from childhood have commanded\r\narmies, whose exploits have been so glorious that the memory of\r\nthem—though they have not been worthily recounted by historians—will\r\nnevertheless live for ever, like those of the Invincible Hero,(633) my\r\nking, whose follower I was, on whom I modelled myself? Achilles my\r\nancestor I strove to rival, but Heracles I ever admired and followed, so\r\nfar as a mere man may follow in the footsteps of a god.)\r\n\r\nὍσα μὲν οὖν ἐχρῆν, ὦ θεοί, πρὸς τοῦτον ἀπολογήσασθαι· καίτοι κρεῖττον ἦν\r\nὑπεριδεῖν αὐτοῦ· εἴρηται.

And if some\r\nthings I did seemed cruel, I never was so to the innocent, but only to\r\nthose who had often and in many ways thwarted me and had made no proper or\r\nfitting use of their opportunities. And even my offences against these,\r\nwhich were due to the emergency of the time, were followed by Remorse,\r\nthat very wise and divine preserver of men who have erred. As for those\r\nwhose ambition it was to show their enmity continually and to thwart me, I\r\nconsidered that I was justified in chastising them.”)\r\n\r\nἘπεὶ δὲ εἴρητο καὶ τούτῳ στρατιωτικώτερον ὁ λόγος, ἐπὶ τὸν Ὀκταβιανὸν τὴν\r\nὑδρίαν ἔφερεν ὁ τοῦ Ποσειδῶνος θεράπων, ἐπιμετρῶν αὐτῷ τοῦ ὕδατος ἔλασσον\r\nδιὰ τὸν καιρόν, ἄλλως τε καὶ μνησικακῶν αὐτῷ τῆς εἰς τὸν θεὸν ὑπερηφανίας.\r\n[D] καὶ ὃς ἐπειδὴ συνῆκεν ὑπὸ ἀγχινοίας, ἀφεὶς τὸ λέγειν τι περὶ τῶν\r\nἀλλοτρίων, Ἐγὼ δέ, εἶπεν. ὦ Ζεῦ καὶ θεοί, τοῦ διασύρειν μὲν τὰ τῶν ἄλλων\r\nἔργα καὶ μικρὰ ποιεῖν ἀφέξομαι, περὶ δὲ τῶν ἐμαυτοῦ τὸν πάντα ποιήσομαι\r\nλόγον. νέος προύστην τῆς ἐμαυτοῦ πόλεως ὥσπερ οὗτος ὁ γενναῖος Ἀλέξανδρος,\r\nκατώρθωσα δὲ Γερμανικοὺς πολέμους ὥσπερ [326] ὁ ἐμὸς πατὴρ οὑτοσὶ Καῖσαρ.\r\nσυμπλακεὶς δὲ τοῖς ἐμφυλίοις ἀγῶσιν Αἴγυπτον μὲν περὶ τὸ Ἄκτιον\r\nκατεναυμάχησα, Βροῦτον δὲ καὶ Κάσσιον περὶ τοὺς Φιλίππους κατεπολέμησα,\r\nκαὶ τὸν Πομπηίου παῖδα Σέξτον πάρεργον ἐθέμην τῆς ἐμαυτοῦ στρατηγίας. οὕτω\r\nδὲ παρέσχον ἐμαυτὸν τῇ φιλοσοφίᾳ χειροήθη, ὥστε καὶ τῆς Ἀθηνοδώρου\r\nπαρρησίας ἠνεσχόμην, οὐκ ἀγανακτῶν, ἀλλ᾽ εὐφραινόμενος ἐπ᾽ αὐτῇ, [B] καὶ\r\nτὸν ἄνδρα καθάπερ παιδαγωγὸν ἢ πατέρα μᾶλλον αἰδούμενος.

Like\r\nthe noble Alexander here I was but a youth when I was called to govern my\r\ncountry. Like Caesar yonder, my father,(638) I conducted successful\r\ncampaigns against the Germans. When I became involved in civil dissensions\r\nI conquered Egypt in a sea‐fight off Actium; I defeated Brutus and Cassius\r\nat Philippi: the defeat of Sextus, Pompey’s son, was a mere incident in my\r\ncampaign. I showed myself so gentle to the guidance of philosophy that I\r\neven put up with the plain speaking of Athenodorus,(639) and instead of\r\nresenting it I was delighted with it and revered the man as my preceptor,\r\nor rather as though he were my own father. Areius(640) I counted my friend\r\nand close companion, and in short I was never guilty of any offence\r\nagainst philosophy. But since I saw that more than once Rome had been\r\nbrought to the verge of ruin by internal quarrels, I so administered her\r\naffairs as to make her strong as adamant for all time, unless indeed, O ye\r\ngods, you will otherwise. For I did not give way to boundless ambition and\r\naim at enlarging her empire at all costs, but assigned for it two\r\nboundaries defined as it were by nature herself, the Danube and the\r\nEuphrates. Then after conquering the Scythians and Thracians I did not\r\nemploy the long reign that you gods vouchsafed me in making projects for\r\nwar after war, but devoted my leisure to legislation and to reforming the\r\nevils that war had caused. For in this I thought that I was no less well\r\nadvised than my predecessors, or rather, if I may make bold to say so, I\r\nwas better advised than any who have ever administered so great an empire.\r\nFor some of these, when they might have remained quiet and not taken the\r\nfield, kept making one war an excuse for the next, like quarrelsome people\r\nand their lawsuits; and so they perished in their campaigns. Others when\r\nthey had a war on their hands gave themselves up to indulgence, and\r\npreferred such base indulgence not only to future glory but even to their\r\npersonal safety. When I reflect on all this I do not think myself entitled\r\nto the lowest place. But whatever shall seem good to you, O ye gods, it\r\nsurely becomes me to accept with a good grace.”)\r\n\r\nΔίδοται μετὰ τοῦτον τῷ Τραïανῷ τοῦ λέγειν ἐξουσία. ὁ δέ, καίπερ δυνάμενος\r\nλέγειν, ὑπὸ ῥᾳθυμίας· [B] ἐπιτρέπειν γὰρ εἰώθει τὰ πολλὰ τῷ Σούρᾳ γράφειν\r\nὑπὲρ αὑτοῦ· φθεγγόμενος μᾶλλον ἢ λέγων, ἐπεδείκνυεν αὐτοῖς τό τε Γετικὸν\r\nκαὶ τὸ Παρθικὸν τρόπαιον. ᾐτιᾶτο δὲ τὸ γῆρας ὡς οὐκ ἐπιτρέψαν αὐτῷ τοῖς\r\nΠαρθικοῖς πράγμασιν ἐπεξελθεῖν. καὶ ὁ Σειληνός, Ἀλλ᾽, ὦ μάταιε, ἔφη,\r\nεἴκοσι βεβασίλευκας ἔτη, Ἀλέξανδρος δὲ οὑτοσὶ δώδεκα. τί οὖν ἀφεὶς\r\nαἰτιᾶσθαι τὴν σαυτοῦ τρυφὴν τὴν τοῦ χρόνου μέμφῃ στενότητα; παροξυνθεὶς\r\nοὖν ὑπὸ τοῦ σκώμματος, [C] οὐδὲ γὰρ ἦν ἔξω τοῦ δύνασθαι ῥητορεύειν, ὑπὸ δὲ\r\nτῆς φιλοποσίας ἀμβλύτερος ἑαυτοῦ πολλάκις ἦν, Ἐγὼ δέ, εἶπεν, ὦ Ζεῦ καὶ\r\nθεοί, τὴν ἀρχὴν παραλαβὼν ναρκῶσαν ὥσπερ καὶ διαλελυμένην ὑπό τε τῆς οἴκοι\r\nπολὺν χρόνον ἐπικρατησάσης τυραννίδος καὶ τῆς τῶν Γετῶν ὕβρεως, [D] μόνος\r\nὑπὲρ τὸν Ἴστρον ἐτόλμησα προσλαβεῖν ἔθνη, καὶ τὸ Γετῶν ἔθνος ἐξεῖλον, οἳ\r\nτῶν πώποτε μαχιμώτατοι γεγόνασιν, οὐχ ὑπὸ ἀνδρείας μόνον τοῦ σώματος, ἀλλὰ\r\nκαὶ ὧν ἔπεισεν αὐτοὺς ὁ τιμώμενος παρ᾽ αὐτοῖς Ζάμολξις. οὐ γὰρ\r\nἀποθνήσκειν, ἀλλὰ μετοικίζεσθαι νομίζοντες ἑτοιμότερον αὐτὸ ποιοῦσιν ἢ\r\nἄλλοι(641) τὰς ἀποδημίας ὑπομένουσιν. ἐπράχθη δέ μοι τὸ ἔργον τοῦτο ἐν\r\nἐνιαυτοῖς ἴσως που πέντε. πάντων δὲ [328] ὅτι τῶν πρὸ ἐμαυτοῦ(642)\r\nγεγονότων αὐτοκρατόρων ὤφθην τοῖς ὑπηκόοις πρᾳότατος καὶ οὔτε Καῖσαρ\r\nοὑτοσὶ περὶ τούτων ἀμφισβητήσειεν ἄν μοι οὔτ᾽ ἄλλος οὐδὲ εἷς, εὔδηλόν ἐστί\r\nπου. πρὸς Παρθυαίους δέ, πρὶν μὲν ἀδικεῖσθαι παρ᾽ αὐτῶν, οὐκ ᾤμην δεῖν\r\nχρῆσθαι τοῖς ὅπλοις· ἀδικοῦσι δὲ ἐπεξῆλθον οὐδὲν ὑπὸ τῆς ἡλικίας κωλυθείς,\r\nκαίτοι διδόντων μοι τῶν νόμων τὸ μὴ στρατεύεσθαι. τούτων δὴ τοιούτων\r\nὄντων, [B] ἆρ᾽ οὐχὶ καὶ τιμᾶσθαι πρὸ τῶν ἄλλων εἰμὶ δίκαιος, πρᾷος μὲν\r\nπρὸς τοὺς ὑπηκόους, φοβερὸς δὲ πρὸς τοὺς πολεμίους διαφερόντως γενόμενος,\r\nαἰδεσθεὶς δὲ καὶ τὴν ὑμετέραν ἔκγονον(643) φιλοσοφίαν; τοιαῦτα ὁ Τραïανὸς\r\nεἰπὼν ἐδόκει τῇ πρᾳότητι πάντων κρατεῖν, καὶ δῆλοί πως ἦσαν οἱ θεοὶ\r\nμάλιστα ἡσθέντες ἐπὶ τούτῳ.\r\n\r\n(Trajan was allowed to speak next. Though he had some talent for oratory\r\nhe was so lazy that he had been in the habit of letting Sura write most of\r\nhis speeches for him; so he shouted rather than spoke, and meanwhile\r\ndisplayed to the gods his Getic and Parthian trophies, while he accused\r\nhis old age of not having allowed him to extend his Parthian conquests.\r\n“You cannot take us in,” said Silenus; “you reigned twenty years and\r\nAlexander here only twelve. Why then do you not put it down to your own\r\nlove of ease, instead of complaining of your short allowance of time?”\r\nStung by the taunt, since he was not deficient in eloquence, though\r\nintemperance often made him seem more stupid than he was, Trajan began\r\nagain. “O Zeus and ye other gods, when I took over the empire it was in a\r\nsort of lethargy and much disordered by the tyranny that had long\r\nprevailed at home, and by the insolent conduct of the Getae. I alone\r\nventured to attack the tribes beyond the Danube, and I subdued the Getae,\r\nthe most warlike race that ever existed, which is due partly to their\r\nphysical courage, partly to the doctrines that they have adopted from\r\ntheir admired Zamolxis.(644) For they believe that they do not die but\r\nonly change their place of abode, and they meet death more readily than\r\nother men undertake a journey. Yet I accomplished that task in a matter of\r\nfive years or so. That of all the Emperors who came before me(645) I was\r\nregarded as the mildest in the treatment of my subjects, is, I imagine,\r\nobvious, and neither Caesar here nor any other will dispute it with me.\r\nAgainst the Parthians I thought I ought not to employ force until they had\r\nput themselves in the wrong, but when they did so I marched against them,\r\nundeterred by my age, though the laws would have allowed me to quit the\r\nservice. Since then the facts are as I have said, do I not deserve to be\r\nhonoured before all the rest, first because I was so mild to my subjects,\r\nsecondly because more than others I inspired terror in my country’s foes,\r\nthirdly because I revered your daughter divine Philosophy?” When Trajan\r\nhad finished this speech the gods decided that he excelled all the rest in\r\nclemency; and evidently this was a virtue peculiarly pleasing to them.)\r\n\r\nΤοῦ Μάρκου δὲ ἀρχομένου λέγειν, ὁ Σειληνὸς ἠρέμα πρὸς τὸν Διόνυσον, [C]\r\nἈκούσωμεν, ἔφη, τοῦ Στωικοῦ τουτουί, τί ποτε ἄρα τῶν παραδόξων ἐκείνων\r\nἐρεῖ καὶ τεραστίων δογμάτων. ὁ δὲ ἀποβλέψας πρὸς τὸν Δία καὶ τοὺς θεούς,\r\nἈλλ᾽ ἔμοιγε, εἶπεν, ὦ Ζεῦ καὶ θεοί, λόγων οὐδὲν δεῖ καὶ ἀγῶνος. εἰ μὲν γὰρ\r\nἠγνοεῖτε τἀμά, προσῆκον ἦν ἐμοὶ διδάσκειν ὑμᾶς· ἐπεὶ δὲ ἴστε καὶ λέληθεν\r\nὑμᾶς τῶν ἁπάντων οὐδέν, [D] αὐτοί μοι τιμᾶτε τῆς ἀξίας. ἔδοξε δὴ οὖν ὁ\r\nΜάρκος τά τε ἄλλα θαυμάσιός τις εἶναι καὶ σοφὸς διαφερόντως ἅτε οἶμαι\r\nδιαγινώσκων,\r\n\r\n(When Marcus Aurelius began to speak, Silenus whispered to Dionysus, “Let\r\nus hear which one of his paradoxes and wonderful doctrines this Stoic will\r\nproduce.” But Marcus turned to Zeus and the other gods and said, “It seems\r\nto me, O Zeus and ye other gods, that I have no need to make a speech or\r\nto compete. If you did not know all that concerns me it would indeed be\r\nfitting for me to inform you. But since you know it and nothing at all is\r\nhidden from you, do you of your own accord assign me such honour as I\r\ndeserve.” Thus Marcus showed that admirable as he was in other respects he\r\nwas wise also beyond the rest, because he knew)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Λέγειν θ᾽ ὅπου χρὴ καὶ σιγᾶν ὅπου καλόν.\r\n\r\n    (“When it is time to speak and when to be silent.”(646))\r\n\r\n\r\nΤῷ Κωνσαταντίνῳ μετὰ τοῦτον λέγειν ἐπέτρεπον. ὁ δὲ πρότερον μὲν ἐθάρρει\r\nτὴν ἀγωνίαν. ὡς δὲ ἀπέβλεπεν εἰς τὰ τῶν ἄλλων ἔργα, μικρὰ παντάπασιν εἶδε\r\nτὰ ἑαυτοῦ.

On first entering the lists he was\r\nconfident enough. But when he reflected on the exploits of the others he\r\nsaw that his own were wholly trivial. He had defeated two tyrants, but, to\r\ntell the truth, one of them(650) was untrained in war and effeminate, the\r\nother(651) a poor creature and enfeebled by old age, while both were alike\r\nodious to gods and men. Moreover his campaigns against the barbarians\r\ncovered him with ridicule. For he paid them tribute, so to speak, while he\r\ngave all his attention to Pleasure, who stood at a distance from the gods\r\nnear the entrance to the moon. Of her indeed he was so enamoured that he\r\nhad no eyes for anything else, and cared not at all for victory. However,\r\nas it was his turn and he had to say something, he began: “In the\r\nfollowing respects I am superior to these others; to the Macedonian in\r\nhaving fought against Romans, Germans and Scythians, instead of Asiatic\r\nbarbarians; to Caesar and Octavian in that I did not, like them, lead a\r\nrevolution against brave and good citizens, but attacked only the most\r\ncruel and wicked tyrants. As for Trajan, I should naturally rank higher on\r\naccount of those same glorious exploits against the tyrants, while it\r\nwould be only fair to regard me as his equal on the score of that\r\nterritory which he added to the empire, and I recovered; if indeed it be\r\nnot more glorious to regain than to gain. As for Marcus here, by saying\r\nnothing for himself he yields precedency to all of us.” “But Constantine,”\r\nsaid Silenus, “are you not offering us mere gardens of Adonis(652) as\r\nexploits?” “What do you mean,” he asked, “by gardens of Adonis?” “I mean,”\r\nsaid Silenus, “those that women plant in pots, in honour of the lover of\r\nAphrodite, by scraping together a little earth for a garden bed. They\r\nbloom for a little space and fade forthwith.” At this Constantine blushed,\r\nfor he realised that this was exactly like his own performance.)\r\n\r\nἩσυχίας δὲ γενομένης οἱ μὲν ἐῴκεσαν περιμένειν, ὄτῳ θήσονται τὴν ὑπὲρ τῶν\r\nπρωτείων οἱ θεοὶ ψῆφον· οἱ δ᾽ ᾤοντο δεῖν τὰς προαιρέσεις εἰς τοὐμφανὲς τῶν\r\nἀνδρῶν προάγειν [330] καὶ οὐ κρίνειν ἐκ(653) τῶν πεπραγμένων αὐτοῖς, ὧν ἡ\r\nΤύχη μετεποιεῖτο τὸ πλεῖστον καὶ πάντων αὐτῶν καταβοῶσα παρειστήκει πλὴν\r\nὈκταβιανοῦ μόνου. τοῦτον δὲ εὐγνώμονα πρὸς ἑαυτὴν εἶναι ἔλεγεν. ἔδοξεν οὖν\r\nτοῖς θεοῖς ἐπιτρέψαι καὶ τοῦτο τῷ Ἑρμῇ, καὶ ἔδοσαν αὐτῷ πρῶτον [B]\r\nἈλεξάνδρου πυθέσθαι, τί νομίσειε κάλλιστον καὶ πρὸς τί βλέπων ἐργάσαιτο\r\nκαὶ πάθοι πάντα ὅσαπερ δεδράκοι τε καὶ πεπόνθοι. ὁ δὲ ἔφη, Τὸ πάντα νικᾶν.\r\nεἶτα, εἶπεν ὁ Ἑρμῆς, οἴει σοι τοῦτο πεποιῆσθαι; καὶ μάλα, ἔφη ὁ\r\nἈλέξανδρος. ὁ δὲ Σειληνὸς τωθαστικῶς μάλα γελάσας, Ἀλλα ἐκράτουν γέ σου\r\nπολλάκις αἱ ἡμέτεραι θυγατέρες, αἰνιττόμενος τὰς ἀμπέλους, [C] τὸν\r\nἈλέξανδρον οἷα δή τινα μέθυσον καὶ φίλοινον σκώπτων. καὶ ὁ Ἀλέξανδρος ἅτε\r\nδὴ γέμων Περιπατητικῶν παρακουσμάτων, Οὐ τὰ ἄψυχα, ἔφη, νικᾶν· οὐδὲ γὰρ\r\nἀγὼν ἡμῖν ἐστι πρὸς ταῦτα· ἀλλὰ πᾶν μὲν ἀνθρώπων, πᾶν δὲ θηρίων γένος, καὶ\r\nὁ Σειληνὸς ὥσπερ οἱ θαυμάζοντες εἰρωνικῶς μάλα, [D] Ἰού, ἰού, ἔφη τῶν\r\nδιαλεκτικῶν κιγκλίδων. αὐτὸς δὲ ἡμῖν ἐν ποτέρῳ σαυτὸν θήσεις γένει, τῶν\r\nἀψύχων ἢ τῶν ἐμψύχων τε καὶ ζώντων; καὶ ὃς ὥσπερ ἀγανακτήσας, Εὐφήμει,\r\nἔφη· ὑπὸ γὰρ μεγαλοψυχίας, ὅτι δὴ καὶ θεὸς γενοίμην, μᾶλλον δ᾽ εἴην,\r\nἐπεπείσμην.

But\r\nthe latter agreed that they must bring to light the motives that had\r\ngoverned each, and not judge them by their actions alone, since Fortune\r\nhad the greatest share in these. That goddess herself was standing near\r\nand kept reproaching all of them, with the single exception of Octavian;\r\nhe, she said, had always been grateful to her. Accordingly the gods\r\ndecided to entrust this enquiry also to Hermes, and he was told to begin\r\nwith Alexander and to ask him what he considered the finest of all things,\r\nand what had been his object in doing and suffering all that he had done\r\nand suffered. “To conquer the world,” he replied. “Well,” asked Hermes,\r\n“do you think you accomplished this?” “I do indeed,” said Alexander.\r\nWhereupon Silenus with a malicious laugh exclaimed, “But you were often\r\nconquered yourself by my daughters!” by which he meant his vines, alluding\r\nto Alexander’s love of wine and intemperate habits. But Alexander was well\r\nstocked with Peripatetic subterfuges, and retorted, “Inanimate things\r\ncannot conquer; nor do we contend with such, but only with the whole race\r\nof men and beasts.” “Ah,” said Silenus, “behold the chicanery of logic!\r\nBut tell me in which class you place yourself, the inanimate or the\r\nanimate and living?” At this he seemed mortified and said, “Hush! Such my\r\ngreatness of soul that I was convinced that I should become, or rather\r\nthat I was already, a god.” “At any rate,” said Silenus, “you were often\r\ndefeated by yourself.” “Nay,” retorted Alexander, “to conquer oneself or\r\nbe defeated by oneself amounts to the same thing. I was talking of my\r\nvictories over other men.” “No more of your logic!” cried Silenus, “how\r\nadroitly you detect my sophisms! But when you were wounded in India,(654)\r\nand Peucestes(655) lay near you and they carried you out of the town at\r\nyour last gasp, were you defeated by him who wounded you, or did you\r\nconquer him?” “I conquered him, and what is more I sacked the town as\r\nwell.” “Not you indeed, you immortal,” said Silenus, “for you were lying\r\nlike Homer’s Hector in a swoon and at your last gasp. It was your soldiers\r\nwho fought and conquered.” “Well but I led them,” said Alexander. “How so?\r\nWhen you were being carried away almost dead?” And then Silenus recited\r\nthe passage in Euripides(656) beginning)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Οἴμοι, καθ᾽ Ἑλλάδ᾽ ὡς κακῶς νομίζεται,\r\n    Ὅταν τρόπαιον πολεμίων στήσῃ στρατός.\r\n\r\n    (“Alas how unjust is the custom of the Greeks, when an army\r\n    triumphs over the enemy—”)\r\n\r\n\r\nκαὶ ὁ Διόνυσος, Παῦσαι, εἶπεν, ὦ παππίδιον, τοιαῦτα λέγων, [C] μή σε οὗτος\r\nὁποῖα τὸν Κλεῖτον ἐργάσηται.(657) καὶ ὁ Ἀλέξανδρος ἐρυθριάσας τε ἅμα καὶ\r\nὥσπερ συγχυθεὶς ὑπὸ τῶν δακρύων τὰ ὄμματα ἐσιώπα. καὶ ὅδε μὲν ὧδε ἔληξεν ὁ\r\nλόγος.\r\n\r\n(But Dionysus interrupted him saying “Stop, little father, say no more, or\r\nhe will treat you as he treated Cleitus.” At that Alexander blushed, his\r\neyes became suffused with tears and he said no more. Thus their\r\nconversation ended.)\r\n\r\nὉ δὲ Ἑρμῆς ἤρετο πάλιν τὸν Καίσαρα, Σοὶ δέ, εἶπεν, ὦ Καῖσαρ, τίς ἐγένετο\r\nσκοπὸς τοῦ βίου; Τὸ πρωτεύειν, [D] ἔφη, τῆς ἐμαυτοῦ καὶ μηδενὸς μήτε εἶναι\r\nμήτε νομίζεσθαι(658) δεύτερον.

Tell me, was it in wisdom\r\nthat you wished to be first, or in oratorical skill, or in military\r\nscience, or the science of government?” “I should have liked well,” said\r\nCaesar, “to be first of all men in all of these; but as I could not attain\r\nto that, I sought to become the most powerful of my fellow‐citizens.” “And\r\ndid you become so very powerful?” asked Silenus. “Certainly,” he replied,\r\n“since I made myself their master.” “Yes, that you were able to do; but\r\nyou could not make yourself beloved by them, though you played the\r\nphilanthropic rôle as though you were acting in a stage‐play, and\r\nflattered them all shamefully.” “What!” cried Caesar, “I not beloved by\r\nthe people? When they punished Brutus and Cassius!” “That was not for\r\nmurdering you,” replied Silenus, “since for that they elected them\r\nconsuls!(661) No, it was because of the money you left them. When they had\r\nheard your will read they perceived what a fine reward was offered them in\r\nit for such resentment of your murder.”)\r\n\r\n[C] Λήξαντος δὲ καὶ τοῦδε τοῦ λόγου, τὸν Ὀκταβιανὸν αὖθις ὁ Ἑρμῆς ἐκίνει.\r\nΣὺ δέ, εἶπεν, οὐκ ἐρεῖς ἡμῖν, τί κάλλιστον ἐνόμιζες εἶναι; καὶ ὅς,\r\nΒασιλεῦσαι, ἔφη, καλῶς.

Govern well! The wickedest tyrants claim to do that.\r\nEven Dionysius,(662) I suppose, thought that he governed well, and so did\r\nAgathocles(663) who was a still greater criminal.” “But you know, O ye\r\ngods,” said Octavian, “that when I parted with my grandson(664) I prayed\r\nyou to give him the courage of Caesar, the cleverness of Pompey, and my\r\nown good fortune.” “What a many things,” cried Silenus, “that do need\r\nreally saving gods have been jumbled together by this doll‐maker!” “Why\r\npray do you give me that ridiculous name?” asked the other. “Why,” he\r\nreplied, “just as they model nymphs did you not model gods,(665) Augustus,\r\nand first and foremost Caesar here?” At this Octavian seemed abashed and\r\nsaid no more.)\r\n\r\nὉ δὲ Ἑρμῆς πρὸς τὸν Τραïανὸν βλέψας, Σὺ δέ, εἶπε, τί διανοούμενος ἔπραττες\r\nὅσαπερ ἔπραξας; Τῶν αὐτῶν Ἀλεξάνδρῳ σωφρονέστερον, εἶπεν, ὠρέχθην. καὶ ὁ\r\nΣειληνός, Ἡττήθης μὲν οὖν,(666) εἶπε, καὶ σὺ τῶν ἀγεννεστέρων. ὁ μὲν γὰρ\r\nθυμοῦ τὸ πλεῖστον ἥττων ἦν, σὺ δὲ αἰσχρᾶς ἡδονῆς καὶ ἐπονειδίστου.

Anger was nearly always his\r\nweak point, but yours was pleasure of the vilest and most infamous sort.”\r\n“Plague take you!” exclaimed Dionysus, “You keep railing at them all and\r\nyou don’t let them say a word for themselves. However, in their case there\r\nwas some ground for your sarcasms, but now consider well what you can find\r\nto criticise in Marcus. For in my opinion he is a man, to quote Simonides,\r\n‘four‐square and made without a flaw.’ ”(669) Then Hermes addressed Marcus\r\nand said, “And you, Verus, what did you think the noblest ambition in\r\nlife?” In a low voice he answered modestly, “To imitate the gods.” This\r\nanswer they at once agreed was highly noble and in fact the best possible.\r\nAnd even Hermes did not wish to cross‐examine him further, since he was\r\nconvinced that Marcus would answer every question equally well. The other\r\ngods were of the same mind; only Silenus cried “By Dionysus I shall not\r\nlet this sophist off so easily. Why then did you eat bread and drink wine\r\nand not ambrosia and nectar like us?” “Nay,” he replied, “it was not in\r\nthe fashion of my meat and drink that I thought to imitate the gods. But I\r\nnourished my body because I believed, though perhaps falsely, that even\r\nyour bodies require to be nourished by the fumes of sacrifice. Not that I\r\nsupposed I ought to imitate you in that respect, but rather your minds.”\r\nFor the moment Silenus was at a loss as though he had been hit by a good\r\nboxer,(670) then he said “There is perhaps something in what you say; but\r\nnow tell me what did you think was really meant by ‘imitating the gods.’ ”\r\n“Having the fewest possible needs and doing good to the greatest possible\r\nnumber.” “Do you mean to say,” he asked, “that you had no needs at all?”\r\n“I,” said Marcus, “had none, but my wretched body had a few, perhaps.”\r\nSince in this also Marcus seemed to have answered wisely, Silenus was at a\r\nloss, but finally fastened on what he thought was foolish and unreasonable\r\nin the Emperor’s behaviour to his son and his wife, I mean in enrolling\r\nthe latter among the deified and entrusting the empire to the former. “But\r\nin that also,” said the other, “I did but imitate the gods. I adopted the\r\nmaxim of Homer when he says ‘the good and prudent man loves and cherishes\r\nhis own wife,’(671) while as to my son I can quote the excuse of Zeus\r\nhimself when he is rebuking Ares: ‘Long ago,’ he says, ‘I should have\r\nsmitten thee with a thunderbolt, had I not loved thee because thou art my\r\nson.’(672) Besides, I never thought my son would prove so wicked. Youth\r\never vacillates between the extremes of vice and virtue, and if in the end\r\nhe inclined to vice, still he was not vicious when I entrusted the empire\r\nto him; it was only after receiving it that he became corrupted. Therefore\r\nmy behaviour to my wife was modelled on that of the divine Achilles, and\r\nthat to my son was in imitation of supreme Zeus. Moreover, in neither case\r\ndid I introduce any novelty. It is the custom to hand down the succession\r\nto a man’s sons, and all men desire to do so; as for my wife I was not the\r\nfirst to decree divine honours to a wife, for I followed the example of\r\nmany others. It is perhaps absurd to have introduced any such custom, but\r\nit would be almost an injustice to deprive one’s nearest and dearest of\r\nwhat is now long‐established. However, I forget myself when I make this\r\nlengthy explanation to you, O Zeus and ye other gods; for ye know all\r\nthings. Forgive me this forwardness.”)\r\n\r\nΠαυσαμένου δὲ καὶ τοῦδε τοῦ λόγου, τὸν Κωνσταντῖνον ὁ Ἑρμῆς ἤρετο, [B] Σὺ\r\nδὲ τί καλὸν ἐνόμισας; Πολλά, εἶπε, κτησάμενον πολλὰ χαρίσασθαι, ταῖς τ᾽\r\nἐπιθυμίαις ταῖς ἑαυτοῦ καὶ ταῖς τῶν φίλων ὑπουργοῦντα. ἀνακαγχάσας οὖν ὁ\r\nΣειληνὸς μέγα, Ἀλλ᾽ ἦ τραπεζίτης εἶναι, ἔφη, θέλων ἐλελήθεις σεαυτὸν\r\nὀψοποιοῦ καὶ κομμωτρίας βίον ζῶν;(673) ᾐνίττετο δ᾽ αὐτὰ πάλαι μὲν ἥ τε\r\nκόμη τό τε εἶδος, ἀτὰρ νῦν καὶ ἡ γνώμη σοῦ κατηγορεῖ. τούτου μὲν οὖν ὁ\r\nΣειληνὸς πικρότερόν τως καθήψατο.\r\n\r\n(When Marcus had finished his speech, Hermes asked Constantine, “And what\r\nwas the height of _your_ ambition?” “To amass great wealth,” he answered,\r\n“and then to spend it liberally so as to gratify my own desires and the\r\ndesires of my friends.” At this Silenus burst into a loud laugh, and said,\r\n“If it was a banker that you wanted to be, how did you so far forget\r\nyourself as to lead the life of a pastrycook and hairdresser? Your locks\r\nand your fair favour(674) betokened this all along, but what you say about\r\nyour motives convicts you.” Thus did Silenus sharply reprove Constantine.)\r\n\r\n[C] Σιωπῆς δὲ γενομένης ἔφερον οἱ θεοὶ λάθρᾳ τὰς ψήφους. εἶτα ἐγένοντο\r\nπολλαὶ τῷ Μάρκῳ. κοινολογησάμενος δὲ ὁ Ζεὺς ἰδίᾳ πρὸς τὸν πατέρα προσέταξε\r\nκηρῦξαι τῷ Ἑρμῇ. ὁ δὲ ἐκήρυττεν, Ἄνδρες οἱ παρελθόντες ἐπὶ τουτονὶ τὸν\r\nἀγῶνα, νόμοι παρ᾽ ἡμῖν εἰσι καὶ κρίσεις τοιαῦται γίνονται, ὥστε καὶ τὸν\r\nνικῶντα χαίρειν καὶ τὸν ἡττώμενον μὴ μέμφεσθαι. πορεύεσθε οὖν, εἶπεν, ὅποι\r\nφίλον ἑκάστῳ, [D] ὑπὸ θεοῖς ἡγεμόσι βιωσόμενοι τὸ ἐντεῦθεν· ἑλέσθω δ᾽\r\nἕκαστος ἑαυτῷ τὸν προστάτην τε καὶ ἡγεμόνα. μετὰ τὸ κήρυγμα τοῦτο ὁ μὲν\r\nἈλέξανδρος ἔθει πρὸς τὸν Ἡρακλέα, Ὀκταβιανὸς δὲ πρὸς τὸν Ἀπόλλωνα, ἀμφοῖν\r\nδὲ ἀπρὶξ εἴχετο τοῦ Διὸς καὶ Κρόνου Μάρκος. πλανώμενον δὲ πολλὰ καὶ\r\nπεριτρέχοντα τὸν Καίσαρα κατελεήσας ὁ μέγας Ἄρης ἥ τε Ἀφροδίτη παρ᾽\r\nἑαυτοὺς ἀκαλεσάτην· Τραïανὸς δὲ παρὰ τὸν Ἀλέξανδρον ἔθει ὡς ἐκείνῳ\r\nσυγκαθεδούμενος.

It turned\r\nout that Marcus had most of the votes. After conferring apart with his\r\nfather,(675) Zeus bade Hermes make a proclamation as follows: “Know all ye\r\nmortals who have entered this contest, that according to our laws and\r\ndecrees the victor is allowed to exult but the vanquished must not\r\ncomplain. Depart then wherever you please, and in future live every one of\r\nyou under the guidance of the gods. Let every man choose his own guardian\r\nand guide.” After this announcement, Alexander hastened to Heracles, and\r\nOctavian to Apollo, but Marcus attached himself closely to Zeus and\r\nKronos. Caesar wandered about for a long time and ran hither and thither,\r\ntill mighty Ares and Aphrodite took pity on him and summoned him to them.\r\nTrajan hastened to Alexander and sat down near him. As for Constantine, he\r\ncould not discover among the gods the model of his own career, but when he\r\ncaught sight of Pleasure, who was not far off, he ran to her. She received\r\nhim tenderly and embraced him, then after dressing him in raiment of many\r\ncolours and otherwise making him beautiful, she led him away to\r\nIncontinence. There too he found Jesus, who had taken up his abode with\r\nher and cried aloud to all comers: “He that is a seducer, he that is a\r\nmurderer, he that is sacrilegious and infamous, let him approach without\r\nfear! For with this water will I wash him and will straightway make him\r\nclean. And though he should be guilty of those same sins a second time,\r\nlet him but smite his breast and beat his head and I will make him clean\r\nagain.” To him Constantine came gladly, when he had conducted his sons\r\nforth from the assembly of the gods. But the avenging deities none the\r\nless punished both him and them for their impiety, and exacted the penalty\r\nfor the shedding of the blood of their kindred,(676) until Zeus granted\r\nthem a respite for the sake of Claudius and Constantius.(677))\r\n\r\n[C] Σοὶ δέ, πρὸς ἡμᾶς λέγων ὁ Ἑρμῆς, δέδωκα τὸν πατέρα Μίθραν ἐπιγνῶναι·\r\nσὺ δ᾽ αὐτοῦ τῶν ἐντολῶν ἔχου, πεῖσμα καὶ ὅρμον ἀσφαλῆ ζῶντί τε σεαυτῷ\r\nπαρασκευάζων, καὶ ἡνίκα ἂν ἐνθένδε ἀπιέναι δέῃ, μετὰ τῆς ἀγαθῆς ἐλπίδος\r\nἡγεμόνα θεὸν εὐμενῆ καθιστὰς σεαυτῷ.\r\n\r\n(“As for thee,” Hermes said to me, “I have granted thee the knowledge of\r\nthy father Mithras. Do thou keep his commandments, and thus secure for\r\nthyself a cable and sure anchorage throughout thy life, and when thou must\r\ndepart from the world thou canst with good hopes adopt him as thy guardian\r\ngod.”)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISOPOGON, OR, BEARD‐HATER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n\r\nJulian came to Antioch on his way to Persia in the autumn of 361 and\r\nstayed there till March, 362. The city was rich and important\r\ncommercially, but in Julian’s eyes her glory depended on two things, the\r\nfamous shrine of Apollo and the school of rhetoric; and both of these had\r\nbeen neglected by the citizens during the reign of Constantius. A\r\nChristian church had been built in Apollo’s grove in the suburb of Daphne,\r\nand Libanius, Antioch’s most distinguished rhetorician, was more highly\r\nhonoured at Nicomedia.(678) Julian’s behaviour at Antioch and his failure\r\nto ingratiate himself with the citizens illustrates one of the causes of\r\nthe failure of his Pagan restoration. His mistake was that he did not\r\nattempt to make Paganism popular, whereas Christianity had always been\r\ndemocratic. He is always reminding the common people that the true\r\nknowledge of the gods is reserved for philosophers; and even the old\r\nconservative Pagans did not share his zeal for philosophy. Antioch\r\nmoreover was a frivolous city. The Emperor Hadrian three centuries earlier\r\nhad been much offended by the levity of her citizens, and the homilies of\r\nSaint Chrysostom exhibit the same picture as Julian’s satire. His austere\r\npersonality and mode of life repelled the Syrian populace and the corrupt\r\nofficials of Antioch. They satirised him in anapaestic verses, and either\r\nstayed away from the temples that he restored or, when they did attend in\r\nresponse to his summons, showed by their untimely applause of the Emperor\r\nthat they had not come to worship his gods. Julian’s answer was this\r\nsatire on himself which he addresses directly to the people of Antioch.\r\nBut he could not resist scolding them, and the satire on his own habits is\r\nnot consistently maintained. After he had left the city the citizens\r\nrepented and sent a deputation to make their peace with him, but in spite\r\nof the intercession of Libanius, who had accompanied him to Antioch, he\r\ncould not forgive the insults to himself or the irreverence that had been\r\ndisplayed to the gods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[337] ΙΟΥΛΙΑΝΟΥ ΑΥΤΟΚΡΑΤΟΡΟΣ\r\n\r\n(Julian, Emperor)\r\n\r\nΑΝΤΙΟΧΙΚΟΣ(679) Η ΜΙΣΟΠΩΓΩΝ\r\n\r\n(Antiochene, or Beard‐Hater)\r\n\r\nἈνακρέοντι τῷ ποιητῇ πολλὰ ἐποιήθη μέλη χαρίεντα· τρυφᾶν γὰρ ἔλαχεν ἐκ\r\nμοιρῶν· Ἀλκαίῳ δ᾽ οὐκέτι οὐδ᾽ Ἀρχιλόχῳ τῷ Παρίῳ τὴν μοῦσαν ἔδωκεν ὁ θεὸς\r\nεἰς εὐφροσύνας καὶ ἡδονὰς τρέψαι· μοχθεῖν γὰρ ἄλλοτε ἄλλως ἀναγκαζόμενοι\r\nτῇ μουσικῇ πρὸς τοῦτο ἐχρῶντο, [B] κουφότερα ποιοῦντες αὑτοῖς ὅσα ὁ δαίμων\r\nἐδίδου τῇ εἰς τοὺς ἀδικοῦντας λοιδορίᾳ. ἐμοὶ δὲ ἀπαγορεύει μὲν ὁ νόμος ἐπ᾽\r\nὀνόματος αἰτιᾶσθαι τοὺς ἀδικουμένους μὲν οὐδέν, εἶναι δ᾽ ἐπιχειροῦντας\r\nδυσμενεῖς, ἀφαιρεῖται δὲ τὴν ἐν τοῖς μέλεσι μουσικὴν ὁ νῦν ἐπικρατῶν ἐν\r\nτοῖς ἐλευθέροις τῆς παιδείας τρόπος. αἴσχιον γὰρ εἶναι δοκεῖ νῦν μουσικὴν\r\nἐπιτηδεύειν, ἢ πάλαι ποτὲ ἐδόκει τὸ πλουτεῖν ἀδίκως.

But Alcaeus and Archilochus of\r\nParos(680) the god did not permit to devote their muse to mirth and\r\npleasure. For constrained as they were to endure toil, now of one sort,\r\nnow of another, they used their poetry to relieve their toil, and by\r\nabusing those who wronged them they lightened the burdens imposed on them\r\nby Heaven. But as for me, the law forbids me to accuse by name those who,\r\nthough I have done them no wrong, try to show their hostility to me; and\r\non the other hand the fashion of education that now prevails among the\r\nwell‐born deprives me of the use of the music that consists in song. For\r\nin these days men think it more degrading to study music than once in the\r\npast they thought it to be rich by dishonest means. Nevertheless I will\r\nnot on that account renounce the aid that it is in my power to win from\r\nthe Muses. Indeed I have observed that even the barbarians across the\r\nRhine sing savage songs composed in language not unlike the croaking of\r\nharsh‐voiced birds, and that they delight in such songs. For I think it is\r\nalways the case that inferior musicians, though they annoy their\r\naudiences, give very great pleasure to themselves. And with this in mind I\r\noften say to myself, like Ismenias—for though my talents are not equal to\r\nhis, I have as I persuade myself a similar independence of soul—“I sing\r\nfor the Muses and myself.”(681))\r\n\r\nΤὸ δ᾽ ᾆσμα πεζῇ μὲν λέξει πεποίηται, λοιδορίας δ᾽ ἔχει πολλὰς καὶ μεγάλας,\r\nοὐκ εἰς ἄλλους μὰ Δία· [B] πῶς γάρ; ἀπαγορεύοντος τοῦ νόμου· εἰς δὲ τὸν\r\nποιητὴν αὐτὸν καὶ τὸν ξυγγραφέα. τὸ γὰρ εἰς ἑαυτὸν γράφειν εἴτε ἐπαίνους\r\nεἴτε ψόγους εἴργει νόμος οὐδείς. ἐπαινεῖν μὲν δὴ καὶ σφόδρα ἐθέλων ἐμαυτὸν\r\nοὐκ ἔχω, ψέγειν δὲ μυρία, καὶ πρῶτον ἀρξάμενος ἀπὸ τοῦ προσώπου. τούτῳ γὰρ\r\nοἶμαι φύσει γεγονότι μὴ λίαν καλῷ μηδ᾽ εὐπρεπεῖ μηδ᾽ ὡραίῳ ὑπὸ δυστροπίας\r\nκαὶ δυσκολίας αὐτὸς [C] προστέθεικα τὸν βαθὺν τουτονὶ πώγωνα, δίκας αὐτὸ\r\nπραττόμενος, ὡς ἔοικεν, οὐδενὸς μὲν ἄλλου, τοῦ δὲ μὴ φύσει γενέσθαι καλόν.\r\nταῦτά τοι διαθεόντων ἀνέχομαι τῶν φθειρῶν ὥσπερ ἐν λόχμῃ τῶν θηρίων.\r\nἐσθίειν δὲ λάβρως ἢ πίνειν χανδὸν οὐ συγχωροῦμαι· δεῖ γὰρ οἶμαι προσέχειν,\r\nμὴ λάθω συγκαταφαγὼν(682) τὰς τρίχας τοῖς ἄρτοις.

For there is no law to prevent one’s writing either praise or\r\ncriticism of oneself. Now as for praising myself, though I should be very\r\nglad to do so, I have no reason for that; but for criticising myself I\r\nhave countless reasons, and first I will begin with my face. For though\r\nnature did not make this any too handsome or well‐favoured or give it the\r\nbloom of youth, I myself out of sheer perversity and ill‐temper have added\r\nto it this long beard of mine, to punish it, as it would seem, for this\r\nvery crime of not being handsome by nature. For the same reason I put up\r\nwith the lice that scamper about in it as though it were a thicket for\r\nwild beasts. As for eating greedily or drinking with my mouth wide open,\r\nit is not in my power; for I must take care, I suppose, or before I know\r\nit I shall eat up some of my own hairs along with my crumbs of bread. In\r\nthe matter of being kissed and kissing I suffer no inconvenience whatever.\r\nAnd yet for this as for other purposes a beard is evidently troublesome,\r\nsince it does not allow one to press shaven “lips to other lips more\r\nsweetly”—because they are smooth, I suppose—as has been said already by\r\none of those who with the aid of Pan and Calliope composed poems in honour\r\nof Daphnis.(683) But you say that I ought to twist ropes from it! Well I\r\nam willing to provide you with ropes if only you have the strength to pull\r\nthem and their roughness does not do dreadful damage to your “unworn and\r\ntender hands.”(684) And let no one suppose that I am offended by your\r\nsatire. For I myself furnish you with an excuse for it by wearing my chin\r\nas goats do, when I might, I suppose, make it smooth and bare as handsome\r\nyouths wear theirs, and all women, who are endowed by nature with\r\nloveliness. But you, since even in your old age you emulate your own sons\r\nand daughters by your soft and delicate way of living, or perhaps by your\r\neffeminate dispositions, carefully make your chins smooth, and your\r\nmanhood you barely reveal and slightly indicate by your foreheads, not by\r\nyour jaws as I do.)\r\n\r\nἘμοὶ δὲ οὐκ ἀπέχρησε μόνον ἡ βαθύτης τοῦ γενείου, ἀλλὰ καὶ τῇ κεφαλῇ\r\nπρόσεστιν αὐχμός, καὶ ὀλιγάκις κείρομαι καὶ ὀνυχίζομαι, καὶ τοὺς δακτύλους\r\nὑπὸ τοῦ καλάμου τὰ πολλὰ ἔχω μέλανας. εἰ δὲ βούλεσθέ τι καὶ τῶν ἀπορρήτων\r\nμαθεῖν, ἔστι μοι τὸ στῆθος δασὺ καὶ λάσιον ὥσπερ τῶν λεόντων, οἵπερ\r\nβασιλεύουσι τῶν θηρίων, οὐδὲ ἐποίησα λεῖον αὐτὸ πώποτε διὰ δυσκολίαν καὶ\r\nμικροπρέπειαν, [C] οὐδὲ ἄλλο τι μέρος τοῦ σώματος εἰργασάμην λεῖον οὐδὲ\r\nμαλακόν. εἶπον γ᾽ ἂν ὑμῖν, εἴ τις ἦν μοι καὶ ἀκροχορδὼν ὥσπερ τῷ\r\nΚικέρωνι·(685) νυνὶ δ᾽ οὐκ ἔστι. καὶ εἰ(686) συγγινώσκετε, φράσω ὑμῖν\r\nκαὶ(687) ἕτερον. ἐμοὶ γὰρ οὐκ ἀπόχρῃ τὸ σῶμα εἶναι τοιοῦτο, πρὸς δὲ καὶ\r\nδίαιτα παγχάλεπος ἐπιτηδεύεται. εἴργω τῶν θεάτρων ἐμαυτὸν ὑπ᾽ ἀβελτηρίας,\r\nοὐδ᾽ εἴσω τῆς αὐλῆς παραδέχομαι τὴν θυμέλην ἔξω τῆς νουμηνίας τοῦ ἔτους\r\nὑπ᾽ ἀναισθησίας, [D] ὥσπερ τινὰ φόρον ἢ δασμὸν εἰσφέρων καὶ ἀποδιδοὺς\r\nἄγροικος ὀλίγα ἔχων οὐκ ἐπιεικεῖ δεσπότῃ. καὶ τότε δὲ εἰσελθὼν τοῖς\r\nἀφοσιουμένοις ἔοικα. κέκτημαι δὲ οὐδένα, καὶ ταῦτα βασιλεὺς ἀκούων μέγας,\r\nὃς καθάπερ ὕπαρχος ἢ στρατηγὸς διὰ πάσης τῆς οἰκουμένης ἄρξει τῶν μίμων\r\nκαὶ τῶν ἡνιόχων· ὅπερ ὑμεῖς ὁρῶντες ὀλίγῳ πρότερον\r\n\r\n(But as though the mere length of my beard were not enough, my head is\r\ndishevelled besides, and I seldom have my hair cut or my nails, while my\r\nfingers are nearly always black from using a pen. And if you would like to\r\nlearn something that is usually a secret, my breast is shaggy, and covered\r\nwith hair, like the breasts of lions who among wild beasts are monarchs\r\nlike me, and I have never in my life made it smooth, so ill‐conditioned\r\nand shabby am I nor have I made any other part of my body smooth or soft.\r\nIf I had a wart like Cicero,(688) I would tell you so; but as it happens I\r\nhave none. And by your leave I will tell you something else. I am not\r\ncontent with having my body in this rough condition, but in addition the\r\nmode of life that I practise is very strict indeed. I banish myself from\r\nthe theatres, such a dolt am I, and I do not admit the thymele(689) within\r\nmy court except on the first day of the year, because I am too stupid to\r\nappreciate it; like some country fellow who from his small means has to\r\npay a tax or render tribute to a harsh master. And even when I do enter\r\nthe theatre I look like a man who is expiating a crime. Then again, though\r\nI am entitled a mighty Emperor, I employ no one to govern the mimes and\r\nchariot‐drivers as my lieutenant or general throughout the inhabited\r\nworld.

Therefore I seldom attend them, only during the\r\nfestivals of the gods; and I do not stay the whole day as my cousin(692)\r\nused to do, and my uncle(693) and my brother and my father’s son.(694) Six\r\nraces are all that I stay to see, and not even those with the air of one\r\nwho loves the sport, or even, by Zeus, with the air of one who does not\r\nhate and loathe it, and I am glad to get away.)\r\n\r\nἈλλὰ τὰ μὲν ἔξω ταῦτα· καίτοι πόστον εἴρηταί μοι μέρος τῶν ἐμῶν εἰς ὑμᾶς\r\nἀδικημάτων; τὰ δὲ ἔνδον ἄγρυπνοι νύκτες ἐν στιβάδι, καὶ τροφὴ παντὸς ἥττων\r\nκόρου πικρὸν ἦθος ποιεῖ καὶ τρυφώσῃ πόλει πολέμιον. οὐ μὴν ὑμῶν· γ᾽ ἕνεκα\r\nτοῦτο ἐπιτηδεύεται παρ᾽ ἐμοῦ· δεινὴ δέ τις ἐκ παιδαρίου με καὶ ἀνόητος\r\nἀπάτη καταλαβοῦσα τῇ γαστρὶ πολεμεῖν ἔπεισεν, οὐδὲ ἐπιτρέπω [C] πολλῶν\r\nἐμπίμπλασθαι σιτίων αὐτῇ. ὀλιγιστάκις(695) οὖν ἐμοὶ τῶν πάντων ἐμέσαι\r\nσυνέβη. καὶ μέμνημαι αὐτὸ παθὼν ἐξ ὅτου καῖσαρ ἐγενόμην ἅπαξ ἀπὸ\r\nσυμπτώματος, οὐ πλησμονῆς. ἄξιον δὲ ὑπομνησθῆναι διηγήματος οὐδὲ αὐτοῦ\r\nπάνυ χαρίεντος, ἐμοὶ δὲ διὰ τοῦτο μάλιστα οἰκείου.\r\n\r\n(But all these things are externals; and indeed what a small fraction of\r\nmy offences against you have I described! But to turn to my private life\r\nwithin the court. Sleepless nights on a pallet and a diet that is anything\r\nrather than surfeiting make my temper harsh and unfriendly to a luxurious\r\ncity like yours. However it is not in order to set an example to you that\r\nI adopt these habits. But in my childhood a strange and senseless delusion\r\ncame over me and persuaded me to war against my belly, so that I do not\r\nallow it to fill itself with a great quantity of food. Thus it has\r\nhappened to me most rarely of all men to vomit my food. And though I\r\nremember having this experience once, after I became Caesar, it was by\r\naccident and was not due to over‐eating. It may be worth while to tell the\r\nstory which is not in itself very graceful, but for that very reason is\r\nespecially suited to me.)\r\n\r\n[D] Ἐτύγχανον ἐγὼ χειμάζων περὶ τὴν φίλην Λουκετίαν· ὀνομάζουσι δ᾽ οὕτως\r\nοἱ Κελτοὶ τῶν Παρισίων τὴν πολίχνην· ἔστι δ᾽ οὐ μεγάλη νῆσος ἐγκειμένη τῷ\r\nποταμῷ, καὶ αὐτὴν κύκλῳ πᾶσαν τεῖχος περιλαμβάνει,(696) ξύλιναι δ᾽ ἐπ᾽\r\nαὐτὴν ἀμφοτέρωθεν εἰσάγουσι γέφυραι, καὶ ὀλιγάκις ὁ ποταμὸς ἐλαττοῦται καὶ\r\nμείζων γένεται, τὰ πολλὰ δ᾽ ἔστιν ὁποῖος ὥρᾳ θέρους καὶ χειμῶνος, ὕδωρ\r\nἥδιστον καὶ καθαρώτατον ὁρᾶν καὶ πίνειν ἐθέλοντι παρέχων. ἅτε γὰρ νῆσον\r\nοἰκοῦντας ὑδρεύεσθαι μάλιστα ἐνθένδε χρή. γίνεται δὲ [341] καὶ ὁ χειμὼν\r\nἐκεῖ πρᾳότερος εἴτε ὑπὸ τῆς θέρμης τοῦ ὠκεανοῦ· στάδια γὰρ ἀπέχει τῶν\r\nἐννακοσίων οὐ πλείω, καὶ διαδίδοται τυχὸν λεπτή τις αὔρα τοῦ ὕδατος, εἶναι\r\nδὲ δοκεῖ θερμότερον τὸ θαλάττιον τοῦ γλυκέος· εἴτε οὖν ἐκ ταύτης εἴτε ἐκ\r\nτινος ἄλλης αἰτίας ἀφανοῦς ἐμοί, τὸ πρᾶγμα ἐστι τοιοῦτον, ἀλεεινότερον\r\nἔχουσιν οἱ τὸ χωρίον οἰκοῦντες τὸν χειμῶνα, καὶ φύεται παρ᾽ αὐτοῖς ἄμπελος\r\nἀγαθή, καὶ συκᾶς ἤδη εἰσιν οἳ(697) ἐμηχανήσαντο, σκεπάζοντες [B] αὐτὰς τοῦ\r\nχειμῶνος ὥσπερ ἱματίοις τῇ καλάμῃ τοῦ πυροῦ καὶ τοιούτοις τισίν, ὅσα\r\nεἴωθεν εἴργειν τὴν ἐκ τοῦ ἀέρος ἐπιγιγνομένην τοῖς δένδροις βλάβην.\r\nἐγένετο δὴ οὖν ὁ χειμὼν τοῦ εἰωθότος σφοδρότερος, καὶ παρέφερεν ὁ ποταμὸς\r\nὥσπερ μαρμάρου πλάκας· ἴστε δήπου τὸν Φρύγιον λίθον τὸν λευκόν· τούτῳ\r\nἐῴκει μάλιστα τὰ κρύσταλλα,(698) μεγάλα καὶ ἐπάλληλα φερόμενα· καὶ δὴ καὶ\r\nσυνεχῆ ποιεῖν ἤδη τὸν πόρον ἔμελλε [C] καὶ τὸ ῥεῦμα γεφυροῦν. ὡς οὖν ἐν\r\nτούτοις ἀγριώτερος ἦν τοῦ συνήθους, ἐθάλπετο δὲ τὸ δωμάτιον οὐδαμῶς, οὗπερ\r\nἐκάθευδον, ὅνπερ εἰώθει τρόπον ὑπογαίοις(699) καμίνοις τὰ πολλὰ τῶν\r\nοἰκημάτων ἐκεῖ θερμαίνεσθαι, καὶ ταῦτα ἔχον εὐτρεπῶς πρὸς τὸ παραδέξασθαι\r\nτὴν ἐκ τοῦ πυρὸς ἀλέαν· συνέβη δ᾽ οἶμαι καῖ τότε διὰ σκαιότητα τὴν ἐμὴν\r\nκαὶ τὴν εἰς ἐμαυτὸν πρῶτον, ὡς εἰκός, ἀπανθρωπίαν· ἐβουλόμην γὰρ ἐθίζειν\r\nἐμαυτὸν ἀνέχεσθαι τὸν ἀέρα ταύτης ἀνενδεῶς ἔχοντα τῆς βοηθείας. ὡς δὲ ὁ\r\nχειμὼν ἐπεκράτει καὶ ἀεὶ μείζων ἐπεγίνετο, [D] θερμῆναι μὲν οὐδ᾽ ὣς\r\nἐπέτρεψα τοῖς ὑπηρέταις τὸ οἴκημα, δεδιὼς κινῆσαι τὴν ἐν τοῖς τοίχοις\r\nὑγρότητα, κομίσαι δ᾽ ἔνδον ἐκέλευσα πῦρ κεκαυμένον καὶ ἄνθρακας λαμπροὺς\r\nἀποθέσθαι παντελῶς μετρίους. οἱ δὲ καίπερ ὄντες οὐ πολλοὶ παμπληθεῖς ἀπὸ\r\nτῶν τοίχων ἀτμοὺς ἐκίνησαν, ὑφ᾽ ὧν κατέδαρθον. ἐμπιμπλαμένης δέ μοι τῆς\r\nκεφαλῆς ἐδέησα μὲν ἀποπνιγῆναι, [342] κομισθεὶς δ᾽ ἔξω, τῶν ἰατρῶν\r\nπαραινούντων ἀπορρῖψαι τὴν ἐντεθεῖσαν ἄρτι τροφήν, οὔτι μὰ Δία πολλὴν\r\nοὖσαν, ἐξέβαλον, καὶ ἐγενόμην αὐτίκα ῥᾴων, ὥστε μοι γενέσθαι κουφοτέραν\r\nτὴν νύκτα καὶ τῆς ὑστεραίας πράττειν ὄ,τιπερ ἐθέλοιμι.\r\n\r\n(I happened to be in winter quarters at my beloved Lutetia—for that is how\r\nthe Celts call the capital of the Parisians. It is a small island lying in\r\nthe river; a wall entirely surrounds it, and wooden bridges lead to it on\r\nboth sides. The river seldom rises and falls, but usually is the same\r\ndepth in the winter as in the summer season, and it provides water which\r\nis very clear to the eye and very pleasant for one who wishes to drink.\r\nFor since the inhabitants live on an island they have to draw their water\r\nchiefly from the river. The winter too is rather mild there, perhaps from\r\nthe warmth of the ocean, which is not more than nine hundred stades\r\ndistant, and it may be that a slight breeze from the water is wafted so\r\nfar; for sea water seems to be warmer than fresh. Whether from this or\r\nfrom some other cause obscure to me, the fact is as I say, that those who\r\nlive in that place have a warmer winter. And a good kind of vine grows\r\nthereabouts, and some persons have even managed to make fig‐trees grow by\r\ncovering them in winter with a sort of garment of wheat straw and with\r\nthings of that sort, such as are used to protect trees from the harm that\r\nis done them by the cold wind. As I was saying then, the winter was more\r\nsevere than usual, and the river kept bringing down blocks like marble.\r\nYou know, I suppose, the white stone that comes from Phrygia; the blocks\r\nof ice were very like it, of great size, and drifted down one after\r\nanother; in fact it seemed likely that they would make an unbroken path\r\nand bridge the stream. The winter then was more inclement than usual, but\r\nthe room where I slept was not warmed in the way that most houses are\r\nheated, I mean by furnaces underground; and that too though it was\r\nconveniently arranged for letting in heat from such a fire. But it so\r\nhappened I suppose, because I was awkward then as now, and displayed\r\ninhumanity first of all, as was natural, towards myself. For I wished to\r\naccustom myself to bear the cold air without needing this aid. And though\r\nthe winter weather prevailed and continually increased in severity, even\r\nso I did not allow my servants to heat the house, because I was afraid of\r\ndrawing out the dampness in the walls; but I ordered them to carry in fire\r\nthat had burned down and to place in the room a very moderate number of\r\nhot coals. But the coals, though there were not very many of them, brought\r\nout from the walls quantities of steam and this made me fall asleep.

I do not even\r\nallow myself to speak out at random fearlessly and freely, but with my\r\nusual awkwardness I am laying information against myself. It is thus and\r\nin words like these that one ought to address men who want to be free not\r\nonly with respect to those who govern them but to the gods also, in order\r\nthat one may be considered well‐disposed towards them, “like an indulgent\r\nfather,”(711) even though one is by nature an ill‐conditioned person like\r\nmyself: “Bear with them then, when they hate and abuse you in secret or\r\neven openly, since you thought that those who applauded you with one\r\naccord in the temples were only flattering you. For surely you did not\r\nsuppose that you would be in harmony with the pursuits or the lives or the\r\ntemperaments of these men. I grant that. But who will bear with this other\r\nhabit of yours? You always sleep alone at night, and there is no way of\r\nsoftening your savage and uncivilised temper—since all avenues are closed\r\nto anything that might sweeten your disposition,—and the worst of all\r\nthese evils is that you delight in living that sort of life and have laid\r\npleasure under a general ban. Then can you feel aggrieved if you hear\r\nyourself spoken of in such terms? No, you ought to feel grateful to those\r\nwho out of kindness of heart admonish you wittily in anapaestic verse to\r\nshave your cheeks smooth, and then, beginning with yourself, first to show\r\nto this laughter‐loving people all sorts of fine spectacles, mimes,\r\ndancers, shameless women, boys who in their beauty emulate women, and men\r\nwho have not only their jaws shaved smooth but their whole bodies too, so\r\nthat those who meet them may think them smoother than women; yes and\r\nfeasts too and general festivals, not, by Zeus, the sacred ones at which\r\none is bound to behave with sobriety. No, we have had enough of those,\r\nlike the oak tree in the proverb;(712) we are completely surfeited with\r\nthem. The Emperor sacrificed once in the temple of Zeus, then in the\r\ntemple of Fortune; he visited the temple of Demeter three times in\r\nsuccession.” (I have in fact forgotten how many times I entered the shrine\r\nof Daphne, which had been first abandoned owing to the carelessness of its\r\nguardians, and then destroyed by the audacious acts of godless men.(713))\r\n“The Syrian New Year arrived, and again the Emperor went to the temple of\r\nZeus the Friendly One. Then came the general festival, and the Emperor\r\nwent to the shrine of Fortune. Then, after refraining on the forbidden\r\nday,(714) again he goes to the temple of Zeus the Friendly One, and offers\r\nup prayers according to the custom of our ancestors. Now who could put up\r\nwith an Emperor who goes to the temples so often, when it is in his power\r\nto disturb the gods only once or twice, and to celebrate the general\r\nfestivals which are for all the people in common, those in which not only\r\nmen whose profession it is to have knowledge of the gods can take part,\r\nbut also the people who have crowded into the city? For pleasure is here\r\nin abundance, and delights whose fruits one could enjoy continuously; for\r\ninstance the sight of men and pretty boys dancing, and any number of\r\ncharming women.”)\r\n\r\nὍταν οὖν ταῦτα λογίσωμαι, μακαρίζω μὲν ὑμᾶς τῆς εὐδαιμονίας, ἐμαυτῷ δὲ οὐκ\r\nἄχθομαι· φίλα γάρ ἐστί μοι κατά τινα θεὸν ἴσως ταῦτα. διόπερ οὐδ᾽\r\nἀγανακτῶ, εὖ ἴστε, τοῖς δυσχεραίνουσί μου τῷ βίῳ καὶ τῇ προαιρέσει.\r\nπροστίθημι δ᾽ αὐτὸς ὅσα δυνατόν ἐστί μοι τοῖς εἰς ἐμαυτὸν σκώμμασι\r\nμειζόνως ἐπικαταχέων ἐμαυτοῦ ταυτασὶ τὰς λοιδορίας, [347] ὃς ὑπὸ ἀφροσύνης\r\nοὐ συνὴκα, ποταπὸν ἐξ ἀρχῆς τὸ τῆσδε τῆς πόλεως ἦθος, καὶ ταῦτα τῶν\r\nἡλικιωτῶν τῶν ἐμῶν, ὡς ἐμαυτὸν πείθω, βιβλία ἀνελίξας οὐδενὸς ἀριθμὸν\r\nἐλάττω. λέγεταί τοί ποτε τὸν ἐπώνυμον τῆσδε τῆς πόλεως βασιλέα, μᾶλλον δὲ\r\nοὗπερ ἐπώνυμος ἥδε ἡ πόλις συνῳκίσθη· πεπόλισται(715) μὲν γὰρ ὑπὸ\r\nΣελεύκου, τοὔνομα δὲ ἔχει ἀπὸ τοῦ Σελεύκου παιδός· ὃν δή φασι δι᾽\r\nὑπερβολὴν ἁβρότητος [B] καὶ τρυφῆς ἐρῶντα ἀεὶ καὶ ἐρώμενον τέλος ἄδικον\r\nἔρωτα τῆς ἑαυτοῦ μητρυιᾶς ἐρασθῆναι· κρύπτειν δ᾽ ἐθέλοντα τὸ πάθος οὐ\r\nδύνασθαι, τὸ σῶμα δ᾽ αὐτῷ κατὰ μικρὸν τηκόμενον ἀφανῶς οἴχεσθαι, καὶ\r\nὑπορρεῖν τὰς δυνάμεις, καὶ τὸ πνεῦμα ἔλαττον εἶναι τοῦ συνήθους. ἐῴκει δ᾽\r\nοἶμαι τὰ(716) κατ᾽ αὐτὸν αἰνίγματι, σαφῆ μὲν οὐκ ἐχούσης αἰτίαν τῆς νόσου,\r\nμᾶλλον δὲ οὐδ᾽ αὐτῆς, [C] ἥτις ποτέ ἐστι, φαινομένης, ἐναργοῦς δ᾽ οὔσης\r\nτῆς περὶ τὸ μειράκιον ἀσθηνίεας. ἐνθάδε μέγας ἆθλος ἰατρῷ προυτέθη τῷ\r\nΣαμίῳ τὴν νόσον, ἥτις ποτέ ἐστιν, ἐξευρεῖν. ὁ δὲ ὑπονοήσας ἐκ τῶν Ὁμήρου,\r\nτίνες ποτέ εἰσιν αἱ γυιοβόροι μελεδῶναι, καὶ ὅτι πολλάκις οὐκ ἀσθένεια\r\nσώματος, ἀλλ᾽ ἀρροστία ψυχῆς αἰτία γίγνεται τηκεδόνος τῷ σώματι, καὶ τὸ\r\nμειράκιον ὁρῶν ὑπό τε ἡλικίας καὶ συνηθείας οὐκ ἀναφρόδιτον, ὁδὸν ἐτράπετο\r\nτοιαύτην ἐπὶ τὴν τοῦ νοσήματος θήραν.

For perhaps it is some god\r\nwho has made me prefer my own ways. Be assured then that I have no\r\ngrievance against those who quarrel with my way of life and my choice. But\r\nI myself add, as far as I can, to the sarcasms against myself and with a\r\nmore liberal hand I pour down on my own head these abusive charges. For it\r\nwas due to my own folly that I did not understand what has been the temper\r\nof this city from the beginning; and that too though I am convinced that I\r\nhave turned over quite as many books as any man of my own age. You know of\r\ncourse the tale that is told about the king who gave his name to this\r\ncity—or rather whose name the city received when it was colonised, for it\r\nwas founded by Seleucus, though it takes its name from the son(717) of\r\nSeleucus—; they say(718) then that out of excessive softness and luxury\r\nthe latter was constantly falling in love and being loved, and finally he\r\nconceived a dishonourable passion for his own step‐mother. And though he\r\nwished to conceal his condition he could not, and little by little his\r\nbody began to waste away and to become transparent, and his powers to\r\nwane, and his breathing was feebler than usual. But what could be the\r\nmatter with him was, I think, a sort of riddle, since his malady had no\r\nvisible cause, or rather it did not even appear what was its nature,\r\nthough the youth’s weakness was manifest. Then the physician of Samos(719)\r\nwas set a difficult problem, namely to discover what was the nature of the\r\nmalady. Now he, suspecting from the words of Homer(720) what is the nature\r\nof “cares that devour the limbs,” and that in many cases it is not a\r\nbodily weakness but an infirmity of soul that causes a wasting of the\r\nbody; and seeing moreover that the youth was very susceptible to love\r\nbecause of his time of life and his habits, he took the following way of\r\ntracking down the disease. He sat near the youth’s couch and watched his\r\nface, after ordering handsome youths and women to walk past him, beginning\r\nwith the queen(721) herself. Now when she entered, apparently to see how\r\nhe was, the young man at once began to show the symptoms of his malady. He\r\nbreathed like one who is being choked; for though he was very anxious to\r\ncontrol his agitated breathing, he could not, but it became disordered,\r\nand a deep blush spread over his face. The physician on seeing this laid\r\nhis hand to his breast, and found that his heart was beating terribly fast\r\nand was trying to burst forth from his breast. Such were his symptoms\r\nwhile she was present; but when she had gone away and others came in he\r\nremained calm and was like a man in a normal state of health. Then\r\nErasistratus saw what ailed him and told the king, and he out of love for\r\nhis son said that he would give up his wife to him. Now the youth for the\r\nmoment refused; but when his father died not long after, he sought with\r\nthe greatest vehemence the favour which he had so honourably refused when\r\nit was first offered to him.(722))\r\n\r\n[B] Ἀντιόχῳ μὲν δὴ ταῦτα ἐποιήθη. τοῖς δ᾽ ἀπ᾽ ἐκείνου γενομένοις οὐ\r\nνέμεσις ζηλοῦν τὸν οἰκιστὴν ἢ τὸν ἐπώνυμον.(723) ὥσπερ γὰρ ἐν τοῖς φυτοῖς\r\nεἰκός ἐστι διαδίδοσθαι μέχρι πολλοῦ τὰς ποιότητας, ἴσως δὲ καὶ ἐπίπαν\r\nὅμοια τὰ μετὰ ταῦτα τοῖς ἐξ ὧν ἐβλάστησε φύεσθαι, οὕτω καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν\r\nἀνθρώπων εἶναι εἰκὸς παραπλήσια τὰ ἤθη τῶν ἀπογόνων τοῖς προγόνοις. ἐγώ\r\nτοι καὶ αὐτὸς ἔγνων Ἀθηναίους [C] Ἑλλήνων φιλοτιμοτάτους καὶ\r\nφιλανθρωποτάτους· καίτοι τοῦτό γε ἐπιεικῶς ἐν πᾶσιν εἶδον τοῖς Ἕλλησιν,\r\nἔχω δ᾽ ὑπὲρ αὐτῶν εἰπεῖν, ὡς καὶ φιλόθεοι μάλιστα πάντων εἰσὶ καὶ δεξιοὶ\r\nτὰ πρὸς τοὺς ξένους, καθόλου μὲν Ἕλληνες πάντες, αὐτῶν δ᾽ Ἑλλήνων πλέον\r\nτοῦτο ἔχω μαρτυρεῖν Ἀθηναίοις. εἰ δὲ ἐκεῖνοι διασώζουσιν εἰκόνα τῆς\r\nπαλαιᾶς ἐν τοῖς ἤθεσιν ἀρετῆς, εἰκὸς δήπουθεν τὸ αὐτὸ ὑπάρχειν καὶ Σύροις\r\nκαὶ Ἀραβίοις καὶ Κελτοῖς καὶ Θρᾳξὶ καὶ Παίοσι καὶ τοῖς ἐν μέσῳ κειμένοις\r\nΘρᾳκῶν [D] καὶ Παιόνων ἐπ᾽ αὐταῖς Ἴστρου ταῖς ᾐόσι Μυσοῖς, ὅθεν δὴ καὶ τὸ\r\nγένος ἐστί μοι πᾶν ἄγροικον, αὐστηρόν, ἀδέξιον, ἀναφρόδιτον, ἐμμένον τοῖς\r\nκριθεῖσιν ἀμετακινήτως· ἃ δὴ πάντα ἐστὶ δείγματα δεινῆς ἀγροικίας.\r\n\r\n(Now since this was the conduct of Antiochus, I have no right to be angry\r\nwith his descendants when they emulate their founder or him who gave his\r\nname to the city. For just as in the case of plants it is natural that\r\ntheir qualities should be transmitted for a long time, or rather that, in\r\ngeneral, the succeeding generation should resemble its ancestors; so too\r\nin the case of human beings it is natural that the morals of descendants\r\nshould resemble those of their ancestors. I myself, for instance, have\r\nfound that the Athenians are the most ambitious for honour and the most\r\nhumane of all the Greeks. And indeed I have observed that these qualities\r\nexist in an admirable degree among all the Greeks, and I can say for them\r\nthat more than all other nations they love the gods, and are hospitable to\r\nstrangers; I mean all the Greeks generally, but among them the Athenians\r\nabove all as I can bear witness. And if they still preserve in their\r\ncharacters the image of their ancient virtue, surely it is natural that\r\nthe same thing should be true of the Syrians also, and the Arabs and Celts\r\nand Thracians and Paeonians, and those who dwell between the Thracians and\r\nPaeonians, I mean the Mysians on the very banks of the Danube, from whom\r\nmy own family is derived, a stock wholly boorish, austere, awkward,\r\nwithout charm and abiding immovably by its decisions; all of which\r\nqualities are proofs of terrible boorishness.)\r\n\r\nΑἰτοῦμαι τοίνυν ὑπὲρ ἐμαυτοῦ πρῶτον συγγνώμην, ἐν μέρει δὲ καὶ ὑμῖν νέμω\r\nτὰ πάτρια ζηλοῦσιν, οὐδ᾽ ἐν ὀνείδει προφέρομαι τὸ\r\n\r\n(I therefore ask for forgiveness, in the first place for myself, and in my\r\nturn I grant it to you also since you emulate the manners of your\r\nforefathers, nor do I bring it against you as a reproach when I say that\r\nyou are)\r\n\r\n\r\n    [349] Ψεῦσταί τ᾽ ὀρχησταί τε χοροιτυπίῃσιν ἄριστοι,\r\n\r\n    (“Liars and dancers, well skilled to dance in a chorus”;(724))\r\n\r\n\r\nτοὐναντίον δὲ ἀντ᾽ ἐγκωμίων ὑμῖν προσεῖναί φημι πατρίων ζῆλον\r\nἐπιτηδευμάτων. ἐπεὶ καὶ Ὅμηρος ἐπαινῶν τὸν Αὐτόλυκόν φησι περιεῖναι πάντων\r\n\r\n(on the contrary it is in the place of a panegyric that I ascribe to you\r\nemulation of the practice of your forefathers.

But whether your ways or\r\nmine are more supportable is perhaps clear to the gods, for among men\r\nthere is no one capable of arbitrating in our disagreement. For such is\r\nour self‐love that we shall never believe him, since everyone of us\r\nnaturally admires his own ways and despises those of other men. In fact he\r\nwho grants indulgence to one whose aims are the opposite of his own is, in\r\nmy opinion, the most considerate of men.)\r\n\r\n[C] Ἐγὼ δὲ ἐννοήσας εὑρίσκω καὶ ἕτερα δεινὰ ἐμαυτὸν εἰργασμένον. πόλει γὰρ\r\nπροσιὼν ἐλευθέρᾳ, τὸν αὐχμὸν τῶν τριχῶν οὐκ ἀνεχομένῃ, ὥσπερ οἱ κουρέων\r\nἀποροῦντες ἄκαρτος καὶ βαθυγένειος εἰσέδραμον· ἐνόμισας ἂν Σμικρίνην ὁρᾶν\r\nἢ Θρασυλέοντα, δύσκολον πρεσβύτην ἢ στρατιώτην ἀνόητον, ἐξὸν φανῆναι τῷ\r\nκαλλωπισμῷ παῖδα ὡραῖον καὶ γενέσθαι μειράκιον, εἰ μὴ τὴν ἡλικίαν, τὸν\r\nτρόπον γε [D] καὶ τὴν ἁβρότητα τοῦ προσώπου. “Οὐκ οἶσθα ἀνθρώποις ὁμιλεῖν,\r\nοὐδ᾽ ἐπαινέτης εἶ τοῦ Θεόγνιδος, οὐδὲ μιμῇ τὸν ἀφομοιούμενον ταῖς πέτραις\r\nπολύπουν, ἀλλ᾽ ἡ λεγομένη Μυκόνιος ἀγροικία τε καὶ ἀμαθία καὶ ἀβελτηρία\r\nπρὸς πάντας ἐπιτηδεύεται παρὰ σοῦ. λέληθέ σε ὅτι(726) πολλοῦ δεῖ ταῦτα\r\nεἶναι Κελτοὶ καὶ Θρᾷκες καὶ Ἰλλυριοί; οὐχ ὁρᾷς, ὁπόσα μὲν ἐν τῇ πόλει\r\nταύτῃ καπηλεῖα; [350] σὺ δὲ ἀπεχθάνῃ τοῖς καπήλοις οὐ ξυγχωρῶν ὁπόσου\r\nβούλονται πωλεῖν αὐτοὺς(727) τῷ δήμῳ τὰ ἐπιτήδεια καὶ τοῖς ἐπιδημοῦσιν. οἱ\r\nδὲ τοὺς κεκτημένους τὴν γῆν αἰτιῶνται. σὺ δὲ καὶ τούτους ἐχθροὺς ποιεῖ\r\nσαυτῷ τὰ δίκαια ποιεῖν ἀναγκάζων. οἱ δὲ ἐν τέλει τῆς πόλεως ἀμφοῖν\r\nμετέχοντες ταῖν ζημίαιν, ὥσπερ οἶιμαι πρότερον ἔχαριρον διχόθεν\r\nκαρπούμενοι τὰς ὠφελείας, [B] καὶ ὡς κεκτημένοι καὶ ὡς καπηλεύοντες, τὰ\r\nνῦν εἰκότως λυποῦνται δι᾽ ἀμφοτέρων ἀφῃρημένοι τὰς ἐπικερδείας. ὁ δὲ τῶν\r\nΣύρων δῆμος οὐκ ἔχων μεθύειν οὐδὲ κορδακίζειν ἄχθεται. σὺ δὲ σῖτον ἄφθονον\r\nπαρέχων οἴει τρέφειν αὐτοὺς ἱκανῶς. ἐκεῖνο δέ σου χαρίεν, ὅτι οὐδὲ ὅπως\r\nἰχθὺς ἐν τῇ πόλει πετραῖος ἔσται σκοπεῖς· ἀλλὰ καὶ πρῴην μεμφομένου τινός,\r\nὡς οὔτε ἰχθυδίων οὔτε ὀρνίθων πολλῶν εὑρισκομένων ἐν ἀγορᾷ, [C] τωθαστικὸν\r\nμάλα ἐγέλασας, ἄρτου καὶ οἴνου καὶ ἐλαίου τῇ σώφρονι πόλει δεῖν φάμενος,\r\nκρεῶν δ᾽ ἤδη τῇ τρυφώσῃ· τὸ γὰρ καὶ ἰχθύων καὶ ὀρνιθίων λόγον ποιεῖσθαι\r\nπέρα τρυφῆς εἶναι καὶ ἧς οὐδὲ τοῖς ἐν Ἰθάκῃ μνηστῆρσι μετῆν ἀσελγείας. ὅτῳ\r\nδὲ οὐκ ἐν ἡδονῇ κρέα ὕεια καὶ προβάτεια σιτεῖσθαι, τῶν ὀσπρίων ἁπτόμενος\r\nεὖ πράξει. ταῦτα ἐνόμισας Θρᾳξὶ νομοθετεῖν [D] τοῖς σεαυτοῦ πολίταις ἢ\r\nτοῖς ἀναισθήτοις Γαλάταις, οἵ σε ἐπαιδοτρίβησαν καθ᾽ ἡμῶν ‘πρίνινον,\r\nσφενδάμνινον,’ οὐκέτι μέντοι καὶ ‘Μαραθωνομάχον,’ ἀλλ᾽ Ἀχαρνέα μὲν ἐξ\r\nἡμισείας, ἀηδῆ δ᾽ ἄνδρα παντάπασι καὶ ἄνθρωπον ἄχαριν. οὐ κρεῖττον ἦν\r\nὀδωδέναι μύρων τὴν ἀγορὰν βαδίζοντός σου καὶ παῖδας ἡγεῖσθαι καλούς, εἰς\r\nοὓς ἀποβλέψουσιν οἱ πολῖται, καὶ χοροὺς γυναικῶν, ὁποῖοι παρ᾽ ἡμῖν\r\nἵστανται καθ᾽ ἑκάστην ἡμέραν;”\r\n\r\n(But now I come to ponder the matter I find that I have committed yet\r\nother terrible sins. For though I was coming to a free city which cannot\r\ntolerate unkempt hair, I entered it unshaven and with a long beard, like\r\nmen who are at a loss for a barber. One would have thought it was some\r\nSmicrines(728) he saw, or some Thrasyleon, some ill‐tempered old man or\r\ncrazy soldier, when by beautifying myself I might have appeared as a\r\nblooming boy and transformed myself into a youth, if not in years, at any\r\nrate in manners and effeminacy of features. “You do not know,” you answer,\r\n“how to mix with people, and cannot approve of the maxim of Theognis,(729)\r\nfor you do not imitate the polypus which takes on the colours of the\r\nrocks. Nay rather you behave to all men with the proverbial Myconian(730)\r\nboorishness and ignorance and stupidity. Are you not aware that we here\r\nare far from being Celts or Thracians or Illyrians? Do you not see what a\r\nnumber of shops there are in this city? But you are hated by the\r\nshopkeepers because you do not allow them to sell provisions to the common\r\npeople and those who are visiting the city at a price as high as they\r\nplease. The shopkeepers blame the landowners for the high prices; but you\r\nmake these men also your enemies, by compelling them to do what is just.\r\nAgain, those who hold office in the city are subject to both penalties; I\r\nmean that just as, before you came, they obviously used to enjoy profits\r\nfrom both sources, both as landowners and as shopkeepers, so naturally\r\nthey are now aggrieved on both accounts, since they have been robbed of\r\ntheir profits from both sources. Then the whole body of Syrian citizens\r\nare discontented because they cannot get drunk and dance the cordax.(731)\r\nYou, however, think that you are feeding them well enough if you provide\r\nthem with plenty of corn. Another charming thing about you is that you do\r\nnot even take care that the city shall have shell‐fish. Nay more, when\r\nsomeone complained the other day that neither shell‐fish nor much poultry\r\ncould be found in the market, you laughed very maliciously and said that a\r\nwell‐conducted city needs bread, wine and olive oil, but meat only when it\r\nis growing luxurious.(732) For you said that even to speak of fish and\r\npoultry is the extreme of luxury and of profligacy such as was beyond the\r\nreach of even the suitors in Ithaca; and that anyone who did not enjoy\r\neating pork and mutton(733) would fare very well if he took to\r\nvegetables.(734) You must have thought that you were laying down these\r\nrules for Thracians, your own fellow‐citizens, or for the uncultured\r\npeople of Gaul who—so much the worse for us!—trained you to be ‘a heart of\r\nmaple, a heart of oak,’ though not indeed ‘one who fought at\r\nMarathon’(735) also, but rather to be half of you an Acharnian and\r\naltogether an unpleasant person and an ungracious fellow. Would it not be\r\nbetter that the market place should be fragrant with myrrh when you walk\r\nthere and that you should be followed by a troop of handsome boys at whom\r\nthe citizens could stare, and by choruses of women like those that exhibit\r\nthemselves every day in our city?”)\r\n\r\n[351] Ἐμὲ δὲ ὑγρὸν βλέπειν ῥιπτοῦντα πανταχοῦ τὰ ὄμματα, ὅπως ὑμῖν καλός,\r\nοὔτι τὴν ψυχήν, ἀλλὰ τὸ πρόσωπον ὀφθείην, ὁ τρόπος οὐ συγχωρεῖ. ἔστι γάρ,\r\nὡς ὑμεῖς κρίνετε, ψυχῆς ἀληθινὸν κάλλος ὑγρότης βίου. ἐμὲ δὲ ὁ παιδαγωγὸς\r\nἐδίδασκεν εἰς γῆν βλέπειν ἐς διδασκάλου φοιτῶντα· θέατρον δ᾽ οὐκ εἶδον\r\nπρὶν μᾶλλον κομῆσαι τῆς κεφαλῆς τὸ γένειον, ἐν ἐκείνῳ δὲ τῆς ἡλικίας ἰδίᾳ\r\nμὲν καὶ κατ᾽ ἐμαυτὸν οὐδέποτε, τρίτον δὲ ἢ τέταρτον, εὖ ἴστε, [B] Πατρόκλῳ\r\nἐπίηρα φέρων ἄρχων ἐπέταττεν οἰκεῖος ὢν ἐμοὶ καὶ ἀναγκαῖος· ἐτύγχανον δὲ\r\nἰδιώτης ἔτι· σύγγνωτε οὖν ἐμοί· δίδωμι γὰρ ὃν ἀντ᾽ ἐμοῦ δικαιότερον\r\nμισήσετε τὸν φιλαπεχθήμονα παιδαγωγόν, ὅς με καὶ τότε ἐλύπει μίαν ὁδὸν\r\nἰέναι διδάσκων καὶ νῦν αἴτιος ἐστί μοι τῆς πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἀπεχθείας, [C]\r\nἐνεργασάμενος τῇ ψυχῇ καὶ ὥσπερ ἐντυπώσας ὅπερ ἐγὼ μὲν οὐκ ἐβουλόμην τότε,\r\nὁ δὲ ὡς δή τι χαρίεν ποιῶν μάλα προθύμως ἐνετίθει, καλῶν οἶμαι σεμνότητα\r\nτὴν ἀγροικίαν καὶ σωφροσύνην τὴν ἀναισθησίαν, ἀνδρείαν δὲ τὸ μὴ εἴκειν\r\nταῖς ἐπιθυμίαις μηδ᾽ εὐδαίμονα ταύτῃ γίνεσθαι. ἔφη δέ μοι πολλάκις, εὖ\r\nἴστε, ναὶ μὰ Δία καὶ μούσας, ὁ παιδαγωγὸς ἔτι παιδαρίῳ κομιδῇ, Μή σε\r\nπαραπειθέτω τὸ πλῆθος τῶν ἡλικιωτῶν ἐπὶ τὰ θέατρα [D] φερόμενον ὀρεχθῆναί\r\nποτε ταυτησὶ τῆς θέας. ἱπποδρομίας ἐπιθυμεῖς; ἔστι παρ᾽ Ὁμήρῳ δεξιώτατα\r\nπεποιημένη· λαβὼν ἐπέξιθι τὸ βιβλίον. τοὺς παντομίμους ἀκούεις ὀρχηστάς;\r\nἔα χαίρειν αὐτούς· ἀνδρικώτερον παρὰ τοῖς Φαίαξιν ὀρχεῖται τὰ μειράκια· σὺ\r\nδ᾽ ἔχεις κιθαρῳδὸν τὸν Φήμιον καὶ ᾠδὸν τὸν Δημόδοκον. ἔστι καὶ φυτὰ παρ᾽\r\nαὐτῷ πολλὰ τερπνότερα ἀκοῦσαι τῶν ὁρωμένων·\r\n\r\n(No, my temperament does not allow me to look wanton, casting my eyes in\r\nall directions in order that in your sight I may appear beautiful, not\r\nindeed in soul but in face. For, in your judgment, true beauty of soul\r\nconsists in a wanton life. I, however, was taught by my tutor to look on\r\nthe ground when I was on my way to school; and as for a theatre, I never\r\nsaw one until I had more hair on my chin than on my head,(736) and even at\r\nthat age it was never on my own account and by my own wish, but three or\r\nfour times, you must know, the governor who was my kinsman and near\r\nrelative, “doing a favour to Patroclus,” ordered me to attend; it was\r\nwhile I was still a private individual.(737) Therefore forgive me. For I\r\nhand over to you instead of myself one whom you will more justly detest, I\r\nmean that curmudgeon my tutor who even then used to harass me by teaching\r\nme to walk in one straight path(738) and now he is responsible for my\r\nquarrel with you. It was he who wrought in my soul and as it were carved\r\ntherein what I did not then desire, though he was very zealous in\r\nimplanting it, as though he were producing some charming characteristic;\r\nand boorishness he called dignity, lack of taste he called sobriety, and\r\nnot yielding to one’s desires or achieving happiness by that means he\r\ncalled manliness. I assure you, by Zeus and the Muses, that while I was\r\nstill a mere boy my tutor would often say to me: “Never let the crowd of\r\nyour playmates who flock to the theatres lead you into the mistake of\r\ncraving for such spectacles as these. Have you a passion for horse races?\r\nThere is one in Homer,(739) very cleverly described. Take the book and\r\nstudy it. Do you hear them talking about dancers in pantomime? Leave them\r\nalone!

Moreover there\r\nare in Homer many plants more delightful to hear of than those that we can\r\nsee:)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Δήλῳ δή ποτε τοῖον Ἀπόλλωνος παρὰ βωμὸν\r\n    [352] Φοίνικος νέον ἔρνος ἀνερχόμενον ἐνόησα.\r\n\r\n    (‘Even so did I once see the young shoot of a date palm springing\r\n    up near the altar of Apollo on Delos.’(741))\r\n\r\n\r\nκαὶ ἡ δενδρήεσσα τῆς Καλυψοῦς νῆσος καὶ τὰ τῆς Κίρκης σπήλαια καὶ ὁ\r\nἈλκίνου κῆπος· εὖ ἴσθι, τούτων οὐδὲν ὄψει τερπνότερον.\r\n\r\n(“And consider the wooded island of Calypso and the caves of Circe and the\r\ngarden of Alcinous; be assured that you will never see anything more\r\ndelightful than these.”)\r\n\r\nἎρα ποθεῖτε καὶ τοὔνομα ὑμῖν φράσω τοῦ παιδαγωγοῦ, καὶ ὅστις ὢν γένος\r\nταῦτα ἔλεγε; βάρβαρος νὴ θεοὺς καὶ θεάς, Σκύθης μὲν τὸ γένος, ὁμώνυμος δὲ\r\nτοῦ τὸν Ξέρξην ἀναπείσαντος ἐπὶ τὴν Ἑλλάδα στρατεῦσαι, καὶ τὸ πολυθρύλητον\r\nτοῦτο δὴ [B] πρὸ μηνῶν μὲν εἴκοσι προσκυνούμενον ὄνομα, νυνὶ δὲ\r\nπροφερόμενον ἀντ᾽ ἀδικήματος καὶ ὀνείδους, εὐνοῦχος ἦν, ὑπὸ τὠμῷ\r\nτεθραμμένος πάππῳ, τὴν μητέρα τὴν ἐμὴν ὅπως ἀγάγοι διὰ τῶν Ὁμήρου καὶ\r\nἩσιόδου ποιημάτων. ἐπεὶ δ᾽ ἐκείνη πρῶτον ἐμὲ καὶ μόνον τεκοῦσα μησὶν\r\nὕστερον ὀλίγοις ἐτελεύτησεν ὑπὸ τῆς ἀμήτορος παρθένου πολλῶν [C] συμφορῶν\r\nἐκκλαπεῖσα κόρη καὶ νέα, μετ᾽ ἐνιαυτὸν ἕβδομον αὐτῷ παρεδόθην. οὗτος ἐξ\r\nἐκείνου ταῦτα ἀνέπεισεν ἄγων ἐς διδασκάλου μίαν ὁδόν· ἄλλην δ᾽ οὔτ᾽ αὐτὸς\r\nεἰδέναι θέλων οὔτ᾽ ἐμοὶ βαδίζειν ξυγχωρῶν ἐποίησεν ἀπεχθάνεσθαί με πᾶσιν\r\nὑμῖν. ἀλλ᾽, εἰ δοκεῖ, σπεισώμεθα πρὸς αὐτὸν ἐγώ τε καὶ ὑμεῖς τὴν ἀπέχθειαν\r\nλύσαντες. οὔτε γὰρ ἠπίστατο πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἀφιξόμενον οὔτ᾽, εἰ τὰ μάλιστα\r\nφοιτᾶν μέλλοιμι, [D] ὅτι καὶ ἄρχων προσεδόκα, καὶ τοσαύτην ἀρχήν, ὅσην\r\nἔδωκαν οἱ θεοί, πολλὰ ὁμοῦ βιασάμενοι, πείσθητέ μοι, καὶ τὸν διδόντα καὶ\r\nτὸν δεχόμενον. ἐῴκει γὰρ ἡμῶν οὐδέτερος ἐθέλειν οὔτε ὁ διδοὺς τὴν τιμὴν ἢ\r\nχάριν ἢ ὅ,τι φίλον ὑμῖν αὐτὸ ὀνομάζειν δοῦναι, καὶ ὁ λαμβάνων, ὡς ἴσασιν\r\nοἱ θεοὶ πάντες, ἀληθῶς ἠρνεῖτο. καὶ δὴ τοῦτο μὲν ὅπῃ τοῖς θεοῖς φίλον ἔχει\r\nτε καὰ ἕξει. τυχὸν δὲ ὁ παιδαγωγὸς εἰ προύγνω τοῦτο, [353] πολλὴν ἂν\r\nἐποιήσατο προμήθειαν, ὅπως ὅ,τι μάλιστα ὑμῖν φανείην κεχαρισμένος.\r\n\r\n(And now do you want me to tell you also my tutor’s name and the\r\nnationality of the man who used to say these things? He was a barbarian,\r\nby the gods and goddesses; by birth he was a Scythian, and he had the same\r\nname(742) as the man who persuaded Xerxes to invade Greece. Moreover he\r\nwas a eunuch, a word which, twenty months ago,(743) was constantly heard\r\nand revered, though it is now applied as an insult and a term of abuse. He\r\nhad been brought up under the patronage of my grandfather, in order that\r\nhe might instruct my mother(744) in the poems of Homer and Hesiod. And\r\nsince she, after giving birth to me her first and only child, died a few\r\nmonths later, snatched away while she was still a young girl by the\r\nmotherless maiden(745) from so many misfortunes that were to come, I was\r\nhanded over to him after my seventh year. From that time he won me over to\r\nthese views of his, and led me to school by one straight path; and since\r\nneither he himself desired to know any other nor allowed me to travel by\r\nany other path, it is he who has caused me to be hated by all of you.\r\nHowever, if you agree, let us make a truce with him, you and I, and make\r\nan end of our quarrel. For he neither knew that I should visit you nor did\r\nhe anticipate that, even supposing I was likely to come here, it would be\r\nas a ruler, and that too over so great an empire as the gods bestowed on\r\nme; though they did not do so, believe me, without using great compulsion\r\nboth towards him who offered and him who accepted it. For neither of us\r\nhad the air of being willing; since he who offered that honour or favour\r\nor whatever you may please to call it, was unwilling to bestow it, while\r\nhe who received it was sincere in steadily refusing it. This matter,\r\nhowever, is and shall be as the gods will. But perhaps if my tutor had\r\nforeseen this he would have exercised much forethought to the end that I\r\nmight, as far as possible, seem agreeable in your eyes.)\r\n\r\nΕἶτα οὐκ ἔξεστιν ἀποθέσθαι νῦν καὶ μεταμαθεῖν εἴ τι πρότερον ἡμῖν ἄγροικον\r\nἦθος ἐνετράφη; Ἔθος, φασί, δευτέρη φύσις· φύσει μάχεσθαι δ᾽ ἔργον, ἐτῶν\r\nτριάκοντα μελέτην ἀφεῖναι παγχάλεπον ἄλλως τε καὶ μετὰ τοσαύτης\r\nἐγγενομένην τῆς χαλεπότητος· ἐμοὶ δὲ ἤδη πλείω τούτων ἐστίν.

Habit, as the saying goes, is second nature. But to fight\r\nwith nature is hard; and to shake off the training of thirty years is very\r\ndifficult, especially when it was carried on with such painful effort, and\r\nI am already more than thirty years old. “Well and good,” you answer, “but\r\nwhat is the matter with you that you try to hear and decide cases about\r\ncontracts? For surely your tutor did not teach you this also, since he did\r\nnot even know whether you would govern.” Yes, it was that terrible old man\r\nwho convinced me that I ought to do so; and you also do well to help me to\r\nabuse him, since he is of all men most responsible for my way of life;\r\nthough he too, you must know, had in his turn been misled by others.\r\nTheirs are names that you have often met when they are ridiculed in\r\nComedy—I mean Plato and Socrates, Aristotle and Theophrastus. This old man\r\nin his folly was first convinced by them, and then he got hold of me,\r\nsince I was young and loved literature, and convinced me that if I would\r\nemulate those famous men in all things I should become better, not perhaps\r\nthan other men—for it was not with them that I had to compete—but\r\ncertainly better than my former self. Accordingly, since I had no choice\r\nin the matter, I obeyed him, and now I am no longer able to change my\r\ncharacter, though indeed I often wish I could, and I blame myself for not\r\ngranting to all men impunity for all wrong‐doing. But then the words of\r\nthe Athenian stranger in Plato occur to my mind: “Though he who does no\r\nwrong himself is worthy of honour, he who does not allow the wicked to do\r\nwrong is worthy of more than twice as much honour. For whereas the former\r\nis responsible for one man only, the latter is responsible for many others\r\nbesides himself, when he reports to the magistrates the wrong‐doing of the\r\nrest. And he who as far as he can helps the magistrates to punish wrong‐\r\ndoers, himself being the great and powerful man in the city, let him I say\r\nbe proclaimed as winner of the prize for virtue. And we ought to utter the\r\nsame eulogy with regard to temperance also, and wisdom and all the other\r\ngood qualities that such a man possesses, and which are such that he is\r\nable not only to have them himself but also to impart them to other\r\nmen.”(747))\r\n\r\nΤαῦτα ἐδίδασκέ με νομίζων ἰδιώτην ἔσεσθαι· [B] καὶ γὰρ οὐδὲ προύγνω ταύτην\r\nἐκ Διός μοι τὴν τύχην ἐσομένην, εἰς ἣν νῦν ὁ θεὸς φέρων κατέστησεν. ἐγὼ δὲ\r\nαἰσχυνόμενος ἄρχων ἰδιώτου φαυλότερος εἶναι λέληθα ἐμαυτόν, οὐδὲν δέον,\r\nὑμῖν τῆς ἀγροικίας μεταδιδοὺς τῆς ἐμαυτοῦ. καί με ἕτερος τῶν Πλάτωνος\r\nνόμων ὑπομνησθέντα ἐμαυτοῦ πεποίηκεν ἀπεχθάνεσθαι πρὸς ὑμᾶς, ὅς φησι δεῖν\r\nαἰδῶ καὶ σωφροσύνην ἀσκεῖν τοὺς ἄρχοντας καὶ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους, [C] ἵνα τὰ\r\nπλήθη πρὸς αὐτοὺς ἀποβλέποντα κοσμῆται. μόνῳ οὖν μοι, μᾶλλον δὲ ξὺν\r\nὀλίγοις ἐπιτηδεύοντι νῦν τοῦτο πρὸς θάτερα περιέστη καὶ γέγονεν οὐκ\r\nἀπεικότως ἐν ὀνείδει. ἑπτὰ γάρ ἐσμεν οἵδε παρ᾽ ὑμῖν ξένοι νεήλυδες, εἷς δὲ\r\nκαὶ πολίτης ὑμέτερος, Ἑρμῇ φίλος καὶ ἐμοί, λόγων ἀγαθὸς δημιουργός, οἷς\r\nοὐδέν ἐστι πρός τινα συμβόλαιον, οὐδ᾽ ἄλλην ὁδὸν βαδίζομεν ἦ πρὸς τὰ τῶν\r\nθεῶν ἱερά, [D] καὶ ὀλιγάκις, οὐ πάντες, εἰς τὰ θέατρα, πεποιημένοι τὸ\r\nδυσκλεέστατον τῶν ἔργων καὶ ἐπονειδιστότατον(748) τοῦ βίου τέλος·\r\nἐπιτρέψουσί μοι πάντως οἱ τῶν Ἑλλήνων σοφοὶ φάναι τι τῶν παρ᾽ ὑμῖν\r\nἐπιπολαζόντων· οὐ γὰρ ἔχω πῶς ἂν αὐτὸ μᾶλλον ἐνδειξαίμην· ἐπὶ τῆς\r\nμεσιτείας αὑτοὺς ἐτάξαμεν, οὕτω περὶ πολλοῦ ποιούμεθα τὸ προσκρούειν ὑμῖν\r\nκαὶ ἀπεχθάνεσθαι, δέον ἀρέσκειν καὶ θωπεύειν. ὁ δεῖνα ἐβιάσατο τὸν δεῖνα.\r\nΤί τοῦτο, ὦ μῶρε, πρὸς σέ; κοινωνεῖν ἐξὸν μετ᾽ εὐνοίας τῶν ἀδικημάτων,\r\nἀφεὶς τὸ κέρδος ἔχθραν ἐπαναιρῇ, [355] καὶ τοῦτο ποιῶν ὀρθῶς οἴει ποιεῖν\r\nκαὶ φρονεῖν ὑπὲρ τῶν σεαυτοῦ. λογίσασθαι ἐχρῆν, ὅτι τῶν μὲν ἀδικουμένων\r\nοὐδεὶς αἰτιᾶται τοὺς ἄρχοντας, ἀλλὰ τὸν ἀδικήσαντα, ὁ δ᾽ ἀδικῶν εἶτα\r\nεἰργόμενος, ἀφεὶς μέμφεσθαι τὸν ἀδικούμενον, εἰς τοὺς ἄρχοντας τρέπει τὸ\r\nἄχθος.\r\n\r\n(These things he taught me when he thought that I should be a private\r\ncitizen. For he certainly did not foresee that there would be assigned to\r\nme by Zeus this lot in life to which the god has now brought me and has\r\nset me therein. But I, because I was ashamed to be less virtuous as a\r\nruler than I had been as a private citizen, have unconsciously given you\r\nthe benefit of my own boorishness, though there was no necessity. And\r\nanother of Plato’s laws has made me take thought for myself and so become\r\nhateful in your eyes: I mean the law which says that those who govern, and\r\nalso the older men, ought to train themselves in respect for others and in\r\nself‐control, in order that the masses may look to them and so order their\r\nown lives aright. Now since I alone, or rather in company with a few\r\nothers, am now pursuing this course, it has had a very different result\r\nand has naturally become a reproach against me. For we here are only seven\r\npersons, strangers and newcomers in your city,—though indeed one of our\r\nnumber is a fellow‐citizen of yours, a man dear to Hermes and to me, an\r\nexcellent craftsman of discourses.(749) And we have business dealings with\r\nno man, nor do we go by any road that does not lead to the temples of the\r\ngods; and seldom, and then not all of us, do we go to the theatres, since\r\nwe have adopted the most inglorious line of conduct and the most unpopular\r\naim and end of life. The wise men of Greece will surely allow me to repeat\r\nsome of the sayings current among you; for I have no better way of\r\nillustrating what I mean. We have stationed ourselves in the middle of the\r\nroad, so highly do we prize the opportunity to collide with you and to be\r\ndisliked, when we ought rather to try to please and flatter you. “So‐and‐\r\nso has oppressed So‐and‐so.” “Fool! What business is it of yours? When it\r\nwas in your power to win his good‐will by becoming the partner in his\r\nwrong‐doing, you first let the profit go, and incur hatred besides; and\r\nwhen you do this you think that you are doing right and are wise about\r\nyour own affairs. You ought to have taken into account that, when men are\r\nwronged, not one of them ever blames the magistrates but only the man who\r\nhas wronged him; but the man who seeks to do wrong and is prevented from\r\nit, far from blaming his proposed victim, turns his grievance against the\r\nmagistrates.)\r\n\r\nἘξὸν οὖν ὑπὸ τῆς εὐλογιστίας ταύτης ἀπέχεσθαι μὲν τοῦ τὰ δίκαια ποιεῖν\r\nἀναγκάζειν, ἐπιτρέψαι δ᾽ ἑκάστῳ πράττειν ὅ, τι [B] ἂν ἐθέλῃ καὶ δυνατὸς ᾖ·\r\nτὸ γὰρ τῆς πόλεως ἦθος οἶμαι τοιοῦτόν ἐστιν, ἐλεύθερον λίαν· σὺ δὲ οὐ\r\nξυνεὶς ἄρχεσθαι αὐτοὺς μετὰ φρονήσεως ἀξιοῖς; οὐδ᾽ ἀπέβλεψας ὅση καὶ μέχρι\r\nτῶν ὄνων ἐστὶν ἐλευθερία παρ᾽ αὐτοῖς καὶ τῶν καμήλων; ἄγουσί τοι καὶ\r\nταύτας οἱ μισθωτοὶ διὰ τῶν στοῶν ὥσπερ τὰς νύμφας· οἱ γὰρ ὑπαίθριοι\r\nστενωποὶ καὶ αἱ πλατεῖαι τῶν ὁδῶν οὐκ ἐπὶ τούτῳ δήπου πεποίηνται, τῷ\r\nχρῆσθαι αὐταῖς τοὺς κανθηλίους, ἀλλ᾽ ἐκεῖναι μὲν αὐτὸ δὴ τοῦτο κόσμου\r\nτινὸς ἕνεκα πρόκεινται καὶ πολυτελείας, [C] χρῆσθαι δὲ ὑπ᾽ ἐλευθερίας οἱ\r\nὄνοι βούλονται ταῖς στοαῖς, εἴργει δ᾽ αὐτοὺς οὐδεὶς οὐδενός, ἵνα μὴ τὴν\r\nἐλευθερίαν ἀφέληται· οὕτως ἡ πόλις ἐστὶν ἐλευθέρα. σὺ δὲ ἀξιοῖς τοὺς ἐν\r\nαὐτῇ νεανίσκους ἄγειν ἡσυχίαν καὶ μάλιστα μὲν φρονεῖν ὅ, τι σοι φίλον, εἰ\r\nδὲ μή, φθέγγεσθαι ὅσων ἂν ἡδέως ἀκούσῃς.(750) οἱ δὲ ὑπ᾽ ἐλευθερίας εἰώθασι\r\nκωμάζειν, ἀεὶ μὲν ἐπιεικῶς αὐτὸ ποιοῦντες, ἐν δὲ ταῖς ἑορταῖς πλέον.\r\n\r\n(“Then when it was in your power by the aid of this careful reasoning to\r\nrefrain from compelling us to do what is just; when you might have allowed\r\nevery man to do whatever he pleases and has the power to do,—for the\r\ntemper of the city is surely like that, excessively independent—do you\r\nthen, I say, fail to understand this and assert that the citizens ought to\r\nbe wisely governed? Have you not even observed what great independence\r\nexists among the citizens, even down to the very asses and camels? The men\r\nwho hire them out lead even these animals through the porticoes as though\r\nthey were brides. For the unroofed alleys and the broad highways were\r\ncertainly not made for the use of pack‐asses, but they are provided merely\r\nfor show and as an extravagance; but in their independence the asses\r\nprefer to use the porticoes, and no one keeps them out of any one of\r\nthese, for fear he should be robbing them of their independence; so\r\nindependent is our city! And yet you think that even the charming youths\r\nin the city ought to keep quiet and, if possible, think whatever you like,\r\nbut at any rate utter only what is agreeable for you to hear!

For it is evident that\r\nuttering them gives pleasure to the former, while the latter rejoice to\r\nhear jests of this sort. I share your pleasure in this unanimity, and you\r\ndo well to be a city of one mind in such matters, since it is not at all\r\ndignified or an enviable task to restrain and chastise the licentiousness\r\nof the young. For if one were to rob human beings of the power to do and\r\nsay what they please, that would be to take away and curtail the first\r\nprinciple of independence. Therefore, since you knew that men ought to be\r\nindependent in all respects, you acted quite rightly, in the first place\r\nwhen you permitted the women to govern themselves, so that you might\r\nprofit by their being independent and licentious to excess; secondly, when\r\nyou entrusted to them the bringing up of the children, for fear that if\r\nthey had to experience any harsher authority they might later turn out to\r\nbe slaves; and as they grew up to be boys might be taught first of all to\r\nrespect their elders, and then under the influence of this bad habit might\r\nshow too much reverence for the magistrates, and finally might have to be\r\nclassed not as men but as slaves; and becoming temperate and well‐behaved\r\nand orderly might be, before they knew it, altogether corrupted. Then what\r\neffect have the women on the children? They induce them to reverence the\r\nsame things as they do by means of pleasure, which is, it seems, the most\r\nblessed thing and the most highly honoured, not only by men but by beasts\r\nalso. It is for this reason, I think, that you are so very happy, because\r\nyou refuse every form of slavery; first you begin by refusing slavery to\r\nthe gods, secondly to the laws, and thirdly to me who am the guardian of\r\nthe laws. And I should indeed be eccentric if, when the gods suffer the\r\ncity to be so independent and do not chastise her, I should be resentful\r\nand angry. For be assured that the gods have shared with me in the\r\ndisrespect that has been shown to me in your city.)\r\n\r\nΤὸ Χῖ, φασίν, οὐδὲν ἠδίκησε τὴν πόλιν οὐδὲ τὸ Κάππα. τί μέν ἐστι τοῦτο τῆς\r\nὑμετέρας σοφίας τὸ αἴνιγμα ξυνεῖναι χαλεπόν, τυχόντες δ᾽ ἡμεῖς ἐξηγητῶν\r\nἀπὸ τῆς ὑμετέρας πόλεως ἐδιδάχθημεν ἀρχὰς ὀνομάτων εἶναι τὰ γράμματα,\r\nδηλοῦν δ᾽ ἐθέλειν τὸ μὲν Χριστόν, τὸ δὲ Κωνστάντιον. ἀνέχεσθε οὖν [B] μου\r\nλέγοντος μετὰ παρρησίας. ἓν μόνον ὑμᾶς ὁ Κωνστάντιος ἠδίκησεν, ὅτι με\r\nκαίσαρα ποιήσας οὐκ ἀπέκτεινεν· ὡς τά γε ἄλλα ὑμῖν μόνοις ἐκ πάντων\r\nῬωμαίων πολλῶν δοῖεν οἱ θεοὶ Κωνσταντίων πειραθῆναι, μᾶλλον δὲ τῶν ἐκείνου\r\nφίλων τῆς πλεονεξίας. ἐμοὶ γὰρ ὁ ἀνὴρ καὶ ἀνεψιὸς ἐγένετο καὶ φίλος. ἐπεὶ\r\nδὲ πρὸ τῆς φιλίας εἵλετο τὴν ἔχθραν, εἶτα ἡμῖν οἱ θεοὶ τὸν πρὸς ἀλλήλους\r\nἀγῶνα λίαν ἐβράβευσαν φιλανθρώπως, [C] ἐγενόμην αὐτῷ πιστότερος φίλος ἢ\r\nπροσεδόκησεν ἕξειν με πρῖν ἐχθρὸν γενέσθαι. τί οὖν οἴεσθέ με τοῖς ἐκείνου\r\nλυπεῖν ἐγκωμίοις, ὃς ἄχθομαι τοῖς λοιδορουμένοις αὐτῷ; Χριστὸν δὲ\r\nἀγαπῶντες ἔχετε πολιοῦχον ἀντὶ τοῦ Διὸς καὶ τοῦ Δαφναίου καὶ τῆς\r\nΚαλλιίπης, ἣ τὸ σόφισμα ὑμῶν ἀπεγύμνωσεν.

Bear with\r\nme then, if I speak frankly. In one thing Constantius did harm you, in\r\nthat when he had appointed me as Caesar he did not put me to death. Now\r\nfor the rest may the gods grant to you alone out of all the many citizens\r\nof Rome to have experience of the avarice of many a Constantius, or I\r\nshould say rather, of the avarice of his friends. For the man was my\r\ncousin and dear to me; but after he had chosen enmity with me instead of\r\nfriendship, and then the gods with the utmost benevolence arbitrated our\r\ncontention with one another, I proved myself a more loyal friend to him\r\nthan he had expected to find me before I became his enemy. Then why do you\r\nthink that you are annoying me by your praises of him, when I am really\r\nangry with those who slander him? But as for Christ you love him, you say,\r\nand adopt him as the guardian of your city instead of Zeus and the god of\r\nDaphne and Calliope(754) who revealed your clever invention? Did those\r\ncitizens of Emesa long for Christ who set fire to the tombs of the\r\nGalilaeans?(755) But what citizens of Emesa have I ever annoyed? I have\r\nhowever annoyed many of you, I may almost say all, the Senate, the wealthy\r\ncitizens, the common people. The latter indeed, since they have chosen\r\natheism, hate me for the most part, or rather all of them hate me because\r\nthey see that I adhere to the ordinances of the sacred rites which our\r\nforefathers observed; the powerful citizens hate me because they are\r\nprevented from selling everything at a high price; but all of you hate me\r\non account of the dancers and the theatres. Not because I deprive others\r\nof these pleasures, but because I care less for things of that sort than\r\nfor frogs croaking in a pond.(756) Then is it not natural for me to accuse\r\nmyself, when I have furnished so many handles for your hatred?)\r\n\r\nἈλλ᾽ ὁ Ῥωμαῖος Κάτων, ὅπως μὲν ἔχων πώγωνος οὐκ οἶδα, παρ᾽ ὁντινοῦν δὲ τῶν\r\nἐπὶ σωφροσύνῃ καὶ μεγαλοψυχίᾳ καὶ τὸ μέγιστον ἀνδρείᾳ μέγα φρονούντων\r\nἄξιος ἐπαινεῖσθαι, προσιὼν τῇδε τῇ πολυανθρώπῳ καὶ τρυφερᾷ καὶ πλουσίᾳ\r\nπόλει [B] τοὺς ἐφήβους ἰδὼν ἐν τῷ προαστείῳ μετὰ τῶν ἀρχόντων ἐσταλμένους\r\nὡς ἐπί τινα δορυφορίαν ἐνόμισεν αὑτοῦ χάριν ὑμῶν τοὺς προγόνους τὴν\r\nπαρασκευὴν πᾶσαν πεποιῆσθαι· καὶ θᾶσσον ἀποβὰς τοῦ ἵππου προῆγεν ἅμα καὶ\r\nπρὸς τοὺς προλαβόντας τῶν φίλων δυσχεραίνων ὡς μηνυτὰς γενομένους αὐτοῖς,\r\nὅτι Κάτων προσάγει, καὶ ἀναπείσαντας ἐκδραμεῖν. ὄντος δ᾽ ἐν τοιούτοις\r\nαὐτοῦ καὶ διαποροῦντος ἠρέμα καὶ ἐρυθριῶντος, ὁ γυμνασίαρχος προσδραμών, Ὦ\r\nξένε, ἔφη, [C] ποῦ Δημήτριος; ἦν δ᾽ οὗτος ἀπελεύθερος Πομπηίου, κεκτημένος\r\nοὐσίαν πολλὴν πάνυ· μέτρον δ᾽ αὐτῆς εἰ ποθεῖτε μαθεῖν· οἶμαι γὰρ ὑμᾶς ἐκ\r\nπάντων τῶν λεγομένων πρὸς ταύτην μάλιστα ὡρμῆσθαι τὴν ἀκοήν· ἐγὼ τὸν\r\nεἰπόντα φράσω.

So he\r\nquickly dismounted from his horse and came forward, though at the same\r\ntime he was vexed with those of his friends who had preceded him for\r\nhaving informed the citizens that Cato was approaching, and so induced\r\nthem to hasten forth. And while he was in this position, and was slightly\r\nembarrassed and blushing, the master of the gymnasium ran to meet him and\r\ncalled out “Stranger, where is Demetrius?” Now this Demetrius was a\r\nfreedman of Pompey, who had acquired a very large fortune; and if you want\r\nto know the amount of it,—for I suppose that in all that I am now telling\r\nyou are most anxious to hear this,—I will tell you who has related the\r\nstory. Damophilus of Bithynia has written compositions of this sort, and\r\nin them, by culling ancedotes from many books, he has produced tales that\r\ngive the greatest delight to anyone who loves to listen to gossip, whether\r\nhe be young or old. For old age usually revives in the elderly that love\r\nof gossip which is natural to the young; and this is, I think, the reason\r\nwhy both the old and the young are equally fond of stories. Well then, to\r\nreturn to Cato. Do you want me to tell you how he greeted the master of\r\nthe gymnasium? Do not imagine that I am slandering your city; for the\r\nstory is not my own.(760) If any rumour has come round, even to your ears,\r\nof the man of Chaeronea,(761) who belongs to that worthless class of men\r\nwho are called by impostors philosophers,—I myself never attained to that\r\nclass though in my ignorance I claimed to be a member of it and to have\r\npart in it,—well he, as I was saying, related that Cato answered not a\r\nword, but only cried aloud like a man stricken with madness and out of his\r\nsenses, “Alas for this ill‐fated city!” and took himself off.)\r\n\r\nΜὴ δὴ θαυμάσητε, τοῦτο εἰ καὶ ἐγὼ νυνὶ πάσχω πρὸς ὑμᾶς, [B] ἀνὴρ\r\nἀγριώτερος ἐκείνου καὶ θρασύτερος τοσούτῳ καὶ αὐθαδέστερος, ὅσον οἱ Κελτοὶ\r\nῬωμαίων. ὁ μὲν γὰρ ἐκεῖσε τεχθεὶς ἐγγὺς ἦλθε γήρως ἅμα τοῖς πολίταις\r\nτρεφόμενος· ἐμοὶ δὲ Κελτοὶ καὶ Γερμανοὶ καὶ δρυμὸς Ἑρκύνιος ἔμελεν ἄρτι\r\nπρῶτον εἰς ἄνδρας τελοῦντι, καὶ διέτριψα πολὺν ἤδη χρόνον, ὥσπερ τις\r\nκυνηγέτης ἀγρίοις ὁμιλῶν καὶ συμπλεκόμενος θηρίοις, [C] ἤθεσιν ἐντυγχάνων\r\nοὔτε θοπεύειν οὔτε κολακεύειν εἰδόσιν, ἁπλῶς δὲ καὶ ἐλευθέρως ἐκ τοῦ ἴσου\r\nπᾶσι προσφέρεσθαι. γέγονεν οὖν μοι μετὰ τὴν ἐκ παίδον τροφὴν ἥ τε ἐν\r\nμειρακίοις ὁδὸς διὰ τῶν Πλάτωνος καὶ Ἀριστοτέλους λόγων οὐδαμῶς ἐπιτηδείων\r\nδήμοις ἐντυγχάνειν οἰομένοις ὑπὸ τρυφῆς εὐδαιμονεστάτοις(762) εἶναι, ἥ τε\r\nἐν ἀνδράσιν αὐτουργία παρὰ τοῖς μαχιμωτάτοις καὶ θυνικωτάτοις τῶν ἐθνῶν,\r\nὅπου τὴν γαμηλίαν Ἀφροδίτην καὶ τὸν μεθυδότην Διόνυσον γάμου τε ἕνεκα καὶ\r\nπαιδοποιίας οἴνου τε ὁπόσης ἑκάστῳ δυνατὸν πόσεως ἴσασι μόνον.

He was born in Rome and was\r\nnurtured among Roman citizens till he was on the threshold of old age. But\r\nas for me, I had to do with Celts and Germans and the Hercynian\r\nforest(763) from the moment that I was reckoned a grown man, and I have by\r\nnow spent a long time there, like some huntsman who associates with and is\r\nentangled among wild beasts. There I met with temperaments that know not\r\nhow to pay court or flatter, but only how to behave simply and frankly to\r\nall men alike. Then after my nurture in childhood, my path as a boy took\r\nme through the discourses of Plato and Aristotle, which are not at all\r\nsuited for the reading of communities who think that on account of their\r\nluxury they are the happiest of men. Then I had to work hard myself among\r\nthe most warlike and high‐spirited of all nations, where men have\r\nknowledge of Aphrodite, goddess of Wedlock, only for the purpose of\r\nmarrying and having children, and know Dionysus the Drink‐Giver, only for\r\nthe sake of just so much wine as each can drink at a draught. And in their\r\ntheatres no licentiousness or insolence exists, nor does any man dance the\r\ncordax on their stage.)\r\n\r\nΛέγεταί τοι μικρῷ πρόσθεν ὡς ἐνθένδε ἐκεῖσέ τις Καππαδόκης φυγάς, ἐν τῇ\r\nπαρ᾽ ὑμῖν τραφεὶς πόλει παρὰ τῷ χρυσοχίῳ· γνωρίζετε δήπουθεν ὃν λέγω·\r\nμαθὼν ὅπου καὶ ἔμαθεν, ὡς οὐ δέον ὁμιλεῖν γυναιξί, μειρακίοις δ᾽\r\nἐπιχειρεῖν, οὐκ οἶδα ὁπόσα ἐνθάδε δράσας καὶ παθών, [360]ἐπειδὴ παρὰ τὸν\r\nἐκεῖσε βασιλέα πρῴην ἀφίκετο, μνήμῃ τῶν τῇδε πολλοὺς μὲν ὀρχηστὰς αὐτοῖς\r\nἐπαγαγεῖν, ἄλλα δὲ τὰ ἐντεῦθεν ἀγαθὰ τοιαῦτα, καὶ δή καὶ τέλος ὡς\r\nἐνεδέησεν ἔτι κοτυλιστοῦ· τοῦτο δ᾽ ὑμεῖς ἴστε πρὸς τῷ ἔργῳ τὸ ὄνομα· καὶ\r\nτοῦτον ἐνθένδε ἐκάλει πόθῳ καὶ ἔρωτι τῆς σεμνῆς παρ᾽ ὑμῖν διαίτης. οἱ\r\nΚελτοὶ δὲ τὸν μὲν κοτυλιστὴν ἠγνόησαν, [B] ἐδέξατο γὰρ αὐτὸν αὐτίκα τὰ\r\nβασίλεια, τοὺς ὀρχηστὰς δὲ ἐπιτραπέντας ἐπιδείκνυσθαι(764) ἐν τῷ θεάτρῳ\r\nτὴν τέχνην εἴασαν οἰόμενοι τοῖς νυμφολήπτοις αὐτοὺς ἐοικέναι. καὶ ἦν\r\nαὐτοῖς ἐκεῖ παραπλησίως ἐμοὶ καταγελαστότατον τὸ θέατρον· ἀλλ᾽ οἱ μὲν\r\nὀλίγοι πολλῶν κατεγέλων, ἐγὼ δὲ ξὺν ὀλίγοις ἐνθάδε γελοῖος ὑμῖν ἅπασι τὰ\r\nπάντα φαίνομαι.\r\n\r\n(A story is told of them that not long ago a certain Cappadocian was\r\nexiled from here to that place, a man who had been brought up in your city\r\nin the house of the goldsmith—you know of course whom I mean,—and had\r\nlearned, as he naturally did learn there, that one ought not to have\r\nintercourse with women but to pay attentions to youths. And when, after\r\ndoing and suffering here I know not what, he went to the court of the king\r\nin that country, he took with him to remind him of your habits here a\r\nnumber of dancers and other such delights from this city; and then finally\r\nsince he still needed a cotylist(765)—you know the word and the thing\r\ntoo—he invited him also from here, because of his longing and love for the\r\naustere mode of life that prevails with you. Now the Celts never made the\r\nacquaintance of the cotylist, since he was at once admitted into the\r\npalace; but when the dancers began to display their art in the theatre,\r\nthe Celts left them alone because they thought that they were like men\r\nstricken with nympholepsy. And the theatre seemed to the men in that\r\ncountry highly ridiculous, just as it does to me; but whereas the Celts\r\nwere a few ridiculing many, I here along with a few others seem absurd in\r\nevery way to all of you.)\r\n\r\n[C] Καὶ οὐκ ἀγανακτῶ τῷ πράγματι. καὶ γὰρ ἂν εἴην ἄδικος εἰ μὴ καὶ τοῖς\r\nπαροῦσι στέργοιμι, διαφερόντως ἀσπασάμενος ἐκεῖνα.

And indeed it would be unjust of me\r\nnot to make the best of the present state of things, after having so\r\ngreatly enjoyed the life among the Celts. For they loved me so much, on\r\naccount of the similarity of our dispositions, that not only did they\r\nventure to take up arms on my behalf, but they gave me large sums of money\r\nbesides; and when I would have declined it, they almost forced me to take\r\nit, and in all things readily obeyed me. And what was most wonderful of\r\nall, a great report of me travelled thence to your city, and all men\r\nproclaimed loudly that I was brave, wise and just, not only terrible to\r\nencounter in war, but also skilful in turning peace to account, easy of\r\naccess and mild‐tempered. But now you have sent them tidings from here in\r\nreturn, that in the first place the affairs of the whole world have been\r\nturned upside down by me—though indeed I am not conscious of turning\r\nanything upside down, either voluntarily or involuntarily; secondly, that\r\nI ought to twist ropes from my beard, and that I war against the _Chi_ and\r\nthat you begin to regret the _Kappa_. Now may the guardian gods of this\r\ncity grant you a double allowance of the _Kappa_!(766) For besides this\r\nyou falsely accused the neighbouring cities, which are holy and the slaves\r\nof the gods, like myself, of having produced the satires which were\r\ncomposed against me; though I know well that those cities love me more\r\nthan their own sons, for they at once restored the shrines of the gods and\r\noverturned all the tombs(767) of the godless, on the signal that was given\r\nby me the other day; and so excited were they in mind and so exalted in\r\nspirit that they even attacked those who were offending against the gods\r\nwith more violence than I could have wished.)\r\n\r\nΤὰ δ᾽ ὑμέτερα· πολλοὶ μὲν ἐγειρομένους ἄρτι τοὺς βωμοὺς ἀνέτρεψαν, οὓς ἡ\r\nπρᾳότης ἡμῶν ἐδίδαξε μόλις ἡσυχάζειν. ἐπεὶ δὲ ἀπεπεμψάμεθα τὸν νεκρὸν τῆς\r\nΔάφνης, οἱ μὲν ἀφοσιούμενοι τὰ πρὸς τοὺς θεοὺς ἐξ ὑμῶν ἀντέδωκαν τοῖς ὑπὲρ\r\nτῶν λειψάνων ἠγανακτηκόσι [C] τοῦ νεκροῦ τὸ τέμενος τοῦ Δαφναίου θεοῦ, οἱ\r\nδὲ εἴτε λαθόντες εἴτε μὴ τὸ πῦρ ἐνεῖσαν(768) ἐκεῖνο, τοῖς μὲν ἐπιδημοῦσι\r\nτῶν ξένων φρικῶδες, ὑμῶν δὲ τῷ δήμῳ μὲν ἡδονὴν παρασχόν, ὑπὸ δὲ τῆς βουλῆς\r\nἀμεληθὲν καὶ εἰσέτι ἀμελούμενον. ἐμοὶ μὲν οὖν ἐδόκει καὶ πρὸ τοῦ πυρὸς\r\nἀπολελοιπέναι τὸν νεὼν ὁ θεός, ἐπεσήμηνε γὰρ εἰσελθόντι μοι πρῶτον τὸ\r\nἄγαλμα, καὶ τούτου μάρτυρα καλῶ τὸν μέγαν Ἥλιον πρὸς τοὺς ἀπιστοῦντας,\r\nὑμᾶς δὲ ὑπομνῆσαι βούλομαι καὶ ἄλλης ἀπεχθείας εμῆς, [D] ἔπειτα, ὅπερ\r\nεἴωθα ποιεῖν ἐπιεικῶς, ὀνειδίσαι ἐμαυτῷ καὶ ὑπὲρ ταύτης καὶ κατηγορῆσαι\r\nκαὶ μέμψασθαι.\r\n\r\n(But now consider your own behaviour. Many of you overturned the altars of\r\nthe gods which had only just been erected, and with difficulty did my\r\nindulgent treatment teach you to keep quiet. And when I sent away the body\r\nfrom Daphne,(769) some of you, in expiation of your conduct towards the\r\ngods, handed over the shrine of the god of Daphne to those who were\r\naggrieved about the relics of the body, and the rest of you, whether by\r\naccident or on purpose, hurled against the shrine that fire which made the\r\nstrangers who were visiting your city shudder, but gave pleasure to the\r\nmass of your citizens and was ignored and is still ignored by your Senate.\r\nNow, in my opinion, even before that fire the god had forsaken the temple,\r\nfor when I first entered it his holy image gave me a sign thereof. I call\r\nmighty Helios to bear me witness of this before all unbelievers. And now I\r\nwish to remind you of yet another reason for your hatred of me, and then\r\nto abuse myself—a thing which I usually do fairly well—and both to accuse\r\nand blame myself with regard to that hatred.)\r\n\r\nΔεκάτῳ γάρ που μηνὶ τῷ παρ᾽ ὑμῖν ἀριθμουμένῳ· Λῶον οἶμαι τοῦτον ὑμεῖς\r\nπροσαγορεύετε· τοῦ θεοῦ τούτου πάτριός ἐστιν ἑορτή, καὶ ἔδει σπουδῇ πρὸς\r\nτὴν Δάφνην ἀπαντᾶν. ἐγὼ μὲν οὖν ἀπὸ τοῦ Κασίου Διὸς ἐπὶ τοῦτο ἔδραμον,\r\nοἰόπμενος ἐνταῦθα μάλιστα τοῦ πλούτου καὶ τῆς φιλοτιμίας ὑμῶν ἀπολαύσειν.\r\nεἶτα ἀνέπλαττον παρ᾽ ἐμαυτῷ πομπήν, [362] ὥσπερ ὀνείρατα ὁρῶν, ἱερεῖα καὶ\r\nσπονδὰς καὶ χοροὺς τῷ θεῷ καὶ θυμιάματα καὶ τοὺς ἐφήβους ἐκεῖ περὶ τὸ\r\nτέμενος θεοπρεπέστατα μὲν τὰς ψυχὰς κατεσκευασμένους, λευκῇ δ᾽ ἐσθῆτι καὶ\r\nμεγαλοπρεπεῖ κεκοσμημένους. ὡς δὲ εἴσω παρῆλθον τοῦ τεμένους, οὔτε\r\nθυμιάματα κατέλαβον οὔτε πόπανον οὔτε ἱερεῖον. αὐτίκα μὲν οὖν ἐθαύμασα καὶ\r\nᾤμην ἔξω τοῦ τεμένους εἶναι, περιμένειν δ᾽ ὑμᾶς, [B] ἐμὲ δὴ τιμῶντας ὡς\r\nἀρχιερέα, τὸ σύνθημα παρ᾽ ἐμοῦ. ἐπεὶ δὲ ἠρόμην, τί μέλλει θύειν ἡ πόλις\r\nἐνιαύσιον ἑορτὴν ἄγουσα τῷ θεῷ, ὁ ἱερεὺς εἶπεν· ἐγὼ μὲν ἥκω φέρων οἴκοθεν\r\nτῷ θεῷ χῆνα ἱερεῖον, ἡ πόλις δὲ τὰ νῦν οὐδὲν ηὐτέεπισται.\r\n\r\n(In the tenth month, according to your reckoning,—Loos I think you call\r\nit—there is a festival founded by your forefathers in honour of this god,\r\nand it was your duty to be zealous in visiting Daphne. Accordingly I\r\nhastened thither from the temple of Zeus Kasios,(770) thinking that at\r\nDaphne, if anywhere, I should enjoy the sight of your wealth and public\r\nspirit. And I imagined in my own mind the sort of procession it would be,\r\nlike a man seeing visions in a dream, beasts for sacrifice, libations,\r\nchoruses in honour of the god, incense, and the youths of your city there\r\nsurrounding the shrine, their souls adorned with all holiness and\r\nthemselves attired in white and splendid raiment. But when I entered the\r\nshrine I found there no incense, not so much as a cake, not a single beast\r\nfor sacrifice. For the moment I was amazed and thought that I was still\r\noutside the shrine and that you were waiting the signal from me, doing me\r\nthat honour because I am supreme pontiff. But when I began to inquire what\r\nsacrifice the city intended to offer to celebrate the annual festival in\r\nhonour of the god, the priest answered, “I have brought with me from my\r\nown house a goose as an offering to the god, but the city this time has\r\nmade no preparations.”)\r\n\r\nἘνταῦθα ὁ φιλαπεχθήμων ἐγὼ πρὸς τὴν βουλὴν ἀνεπιεικεῖς πάνυ διελέχθην\r\nλόγους, ὧν ἴσως οὐκ ἄτοπον καὶ νῦν μνημονεῦσαι. “Δεινόν,” ἔφην ἐγώ, “τὴν\r\nτοσαύτην πόλιν οὕτω τῶν θεῶν ὀλιγώρως ἔχειν, ὡς οὐδεμία παροικοῦσα ταῖς\r\nἐσχατιαῖς τοῦ Πόντου κώμη· [C] μυρίους κλήρους γῆς ἰδίας κεκτημένη, τῷ\r\nπατρίῳ θεῷ νῦν πρῶτον ἐπιστάσης ἑορτῆς ἐνιαυσίου, ἐπειδὴ διεσκέδασαν οἱ\r\nθεοὶ τῆς ἀθεότητος τὴν νεφέλην, μίαν ὄρνιν(771) ὑπὲρ αὑτῆς οὐ προσάγει, ἣν\r\nἐχρῆν μάλιστα μὲν καὶ κατὰ φυλὰς βουθυτεῖν, εἰ δὲ μὴ ῥᾴδιον, ἕνα γε(772)\r\nκοινῇ πᾶσαν ὑπὲρ αὑτῆς προσφέρειν τῷ θεῷ ταῦρον.

Yet every one of you\r\ndelights to spend money privately on dinners and feasts; and I know very\r\nwell that many of you squandered very large sums of money on dinners\r\nduring the May festival. Nevertheless, on your own behalf and on behalf of\r\nthe city’s welfare not one of the citizens offers a private sacrifice, nor\r\ndoes the city offer a public sacrifice, but only this priest! Yet I think\r\nthat it would have been more just for him to go home carrying portions\r\nfrom the multitude of beasts offered by you to the god. For the duty\r\nassigned by the gods to priests is to do them honour by their nobility of\r\ncharacter and by the practice of virtue, and also to perform to them the\r\nservice that is due; but it befits the city, I think, to offer both\r\nprivate and public sacrifice. But as it is, every one of you allows his\r\nwife to carry everything out of his house to the Galilaeans, and when your\r\nwives feed the poor at your expense they inspire a great admiration for\r\ngodlessness in those who are in need of such bounty—and of such sort are,\r\nI think, the great majority of mankind,—while as for yourselves you think\r\nthat you are doing nothing out of the way when in the first place you are\r\ncareless of the honours due to the gods, and not one of those in need goes\r\nnear the temples—for there is nothing there, I think, to feed them\r\nwith—and yet when any one of you gives a birthday feast he provides a\r\ndinner and a breakfast without stint and welcomes his friends to a costly\r\ntable; when, however, the annual festival arrived no one furnished olive\r\noil for a lamp for the god, or a libation, or a beast for sacrifice, or\r\nincense. Now I do not know how any good man could endure to see such\r\nthings in your city, and for my part I am sure that it is displeasing to\r\nthe gods also.”)\r\n\r\nΤοιαῦτα εἰπὼν τότε μέμνημαι, καὶ ὁ μὲν θεὸς ἐμαρτύρησέ μου τοῖς λόγοις, ὡς\r\nμήποτε ὤφελεν, ἐκλιπὼν τὸ προάστειον, ὃ πολὺν ἐτήρησε χρόνον, ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ\r\nζάλῃ τρέψας ἀλλαχοῦ τῶν κρατούντων τὴν διάνοιαν καὶ τὼ χεῖρε βιασάμενος.\r\nὑμῖν δ᾽ ἀπηχθόμην ἐγὼ ποιῶν ἀνοήτως. ἐχρῆν γὰρ σιωπᾶν, ὥσπερ οἶμαι πολλοὶ\r\nκαὶ ἄλλοι τῶν συνεισελθόντων ἐμοί, καὶ μὴ πολυπραγμονεῖν μηδ᾽ ἐπιτιμᾶν.\r\n[D] ἀλλ᾽ ὑπὸ προπετείας ἐγὼ καὶ τῆς καταγελάστου κολακείας· οὐ γὰρ δὴ\r\nνομιστέον ὑπ᾽ εὐνοίας ἐμοὶ τότε εἰρῆσθαι τοὺς πρὸς ὑμᾶς λόγους, ἀλλ᾽ οἶμαι\r\nδόξαν θηρεύων εὐλαβείας τε εἰς τοὺς θεοὺς καὶ εἰς ὑμᾶς εὐνοίας ἀδόλου·\r\nτοῦτο δ᾽ ἐστὶν οἶμαι παγγέλοιος κολακεία· πολλὰ ὑμῶν μάτην κατέχεα.

But I acted\r\nfoolishly in making myself odious to you. For I ought to have remained\r\nsilent as, I think, did many of those who came here with me, and I ought\r\nnot to have been meddlesome or found fault. But I poured down all these\r\nreproaches on your heads to no purpose, owing to my headlong temper and a\r\nridiculous desire to flatter,—for it is surely not to be believed that out\r\nof goodwill towards you I spoke those words to you then; but I was, I\r\nthink, hunting after a reputation for piety towards the gods and for\r\nsincere good‐will towards you, which is, I think, the most absurd form of\r\nflattery. Therefore you treat me justly when you defend yourselves against\r\nthose criticisms of mine and choose a different place for making your\r\ndefence. For I abused you under the god’s statue near his altar and the\r\nfootprints of the holy image, in the presence of few witnesses; but you\r\nabused me in the market‐place, in the presence of the whole populace, and\r\nwith the help of citizens who were capable of composing such pleasant\r\nwitticisms as yours. For you must be well aware that all of you, those who\r\nuttered the sayings about me and those who listened to them, are equally\r\nresponsible; and he who listened with pleasure to those slanders, since he\r\nhad an equal share of the pleasure, though he took less trouble than the\r\nspeaker, must share the blame.)\r\n\r\nΕἴρηται οὖν ὑμῖν δι᾽ ὅλης καὶ ἠκρόαται τῆς πόλεως ὁπόσα εἰς τουτονὶ\r\nπέπαικται τὸν φαῦλον πώγωνα καὶ τὸν οὐδὲν ἐπιδείξαντα ὑμῖν καλὸν οὐδὲ\r\nἐπιδείξοντα τρόπον. οὐ γὰρ ἐπιδείξει βίον ὑμῖν, ὁποῖον ὑμεῖς ἀεὶ μὲν ζῆτε,\r\nποθεῖτε δὲ ὁρᾶν καὶ ἐν τοῖς ἄρχουσιν. ὑπὲρ μὲν δὴ τῶν βλασφημιῶν, ἃς ἰδίᾳ\r\n[C] τε καὶ δημοσίᾳ κατεχέατέ μου παίζοντες ἐν τοῖς ἀναπαίστοις, ἐμαυτοῦ\r\nπροσκατηγορήσας ὑμῖν ἐπιτρέπω χρῆσθαι μετὰ μείζονος αὐτῷ παρρησίας, ὡς\r\nοὐδὲν ὑμᾶς ἐγὼ διὰ τοῦτο πώποτε δεινὸν ἐργάσομαι σφάττων ἢ τύπτων ἢ δῶν ἦ\r\nἀποκλείων ἢ κολάζων. πῶς γάρ; ὅς, ἐπείπερ ὑμῖν ἐμαυτὸν ἐπιδείξας μετὰ τῶν\r\nφίλων σωφρονοῦντα, φαυλότατον ἐδεῖν ὑμῖν καὶ ἀηδέστατον, οὐδὲν [D]\r\nἐπέδειξα καλὸν θέαμα, μεταστῆναι τῆς πόλεως(776) ἔγνωκα καὶ ὑποχωρῆσαι,\r\nπεπεισμένος μὲν οὐδαμῶς, ὅτι πάντως ἐκείνοις ἀρέσω, πρὸς οὓς πορεύομαι,\r\nκρίνων δ᾽ αἱρετώτερον, εἰ διαμάρτοιμι τοῦ δόξαι γοῦν ἐκείνοις καλὸς\r\nκἀγαθός, ἐν μέρει μεταδοῦναι πᾶσι τῆς ἀηδίας τῆς ἐμαυτοῦ καὶ μὴ τὴν\r\nεὐδαίμονα ταύτην ἀποκναῖσαι πόλιν ὥσπερ ὑπὸ δυσωδίας τῆς ἐμῆς μετριότητος\r\nκαὶ τῶν ἐμῶν ἐπιτηδείων τῆς σωφροσύνης.\r\n\r\n(Throughout the whole city, then, you both uttered and listened to all the\r\njests that were made about this miserable beard of mine, and about one who\r\nhas never displayed to you nor ever will display any charm of manner. For\r\nhe will never display among you the sort of life that you always live and\r\ndesire to see also among those who govern you. Next with respect to the\r\nslanders which both in private and publicly you have poured down on my\r\nhead, when you ridiculed me in anapaestic verse, since I too have accused\r\nmyself I permit you to employ that method with even greater frankness; for\r\nI shall never on that account do you any harm, by slaying or beating or\r\nfettering or imprisoning you or punishing you in any way. Why indeed\r\nshould I? For now that in showing you myself, in company with my friends,\r\nbehaving with sobriety,—a most sorry and unpleasing sight to you—I have\r\nfailed to show you any beautiful spectacle, I have decided to leave this\r\ncity and to retire from it; not indeed because I am convinced that I shall\r\nbe in all respects pleasing to those to whom I am going, but because I\r\njudge it more desirable, in case I should fail at least to seem to them an\r\nhonourable and good man, to give all men in turn a share of my\r\nunpleasantness,(777) and not to annoy this happy city with the evil odour,\r\nas it were, of my moderation and the sobriety of my friends.)\r\n\r\n[365] Ἡμῶν γὰρ οὐδεὶς ἀγρὸν οὐδὲ κῆπον ἐπρίατο παρ᾽ ὑμῖν οὐδὲ οἰκίαν\r\nᾠκοδόμησεν οὐδ᾽ ἔγημε παρ᾽ ὑμῶν οὐδ᾽ ἐξέδωκεν εἰς ὑμᾶς οὐδὲ ἠράσθημεν τῶν\r\nπαρ᾽ ὑμῖν καλῶν, οὐδ᾽ ἐζηλώσαμεν Ἀσσύριον πλοῦτον οὐδ᾽ ἐνειμάμεθα τὰς\r\nπροστασίας οὐδὲ παραδυναστεύειν ἡμῖν ἠνεσχόμεθά τινας τῶν ἐν τέλει οὐδ᾽\r\nἐπείσαμεν τὸν δῆμον εἰς παρασκευὰς δείπνων ἢ θεάτρων, ὃν οὕτως ἐποιήσαμεν\r\nτρυφᾶν, ὥστε ἄγων σχολὴν [B] ἀπὸ τῆς ἐνδείας τοὺς ἀναπαίστους εἰς τοὺς\r\nαἰτίους αὑτῷ τῆς εὐθηνίας ξυνέθηκεν, οὐδ᾽ ἐπεγράψαμεν χρυσίον οὐδὲ\r\nᾐτήσαμεν ἀργύριον οὐδὲ ηὐξήσαμεν φόρους· ἀλλὰ πρὸς τοῖς ἐλλείμμασιν\r\nἀνεῖται πᾶσι τῶν εἰθισμένων εἰσφορῶν τὸ πέμπτον. οὐκ οἶμαι δ᾽ ἐξαρκεῖν τὸ\r\nσωφρονεῖν ἐμέ, ἀλλὰ καὶ(778) μέτριον ἔχω ναὶ μὰ Δία καὶ θεούς, ὡς ἐμαυτὸν\r\nπείθω, τὸν εἰσαγγελέα, καλῶς ὑφ᾽ ὑμῶν ἐπιτιμηθέντα, διότι γέρων ὢν καὶ\r\nφαλακρὸς ἠρέμα τὰ πρόσω διὰ δυστροπίαν [C] αἰσχύνεται κομᾶν ἐξόπισθεν,\r\nὥσπερ Ὅμηρος ἐποίησε τοὺς Ἄβαντας, οὐδὲν δ᾽ ἐκείνου φαυλοτέρους ἄνδρας\r\nοἴκοι παρ᾽ ἐμαυτῷ δύο καὶ τρεῖς, ἀλλὰ καὶ τέτταρας, εἰ βούλεσθε δὲ νυνὶ\r\nκαὶ πέμπτον.\r\n\r\n(For not one of us has bought a field or garden in your city or built a\r\nhouse or married or given in marriage among you, or fallen in love with\r\nany of your handsome youths, or coveted the wealth of Assyria, or awarded\r\ncourt patronage;(779) nor have we allowed any of those in office to\r\nexercise influence over us, or induced the populace to get up banquets or\r\ntheatrical shows; nay rather we have procured for them such luxurious ease\r\nthat, since they have respite from want, they have had leisure to compose\r\ntheir anapaests against the very author of their well‐being. Again, I have\r\nnot levied gold money or demanded silver money or increased the tribute;\r\nbut in addition to the arrears, one‐fifth of the regular taxes has been in\r\nall cases remitted. Moreover I do not think it enough that I myself\r\npractise self‐restraint, but I have also an usher who, by Zeus and the\r\nother gods, is moderate indeed, as I believe, though he has been finely\r\nscolded by you, because, being an old man and slightly bald in front, in\r\nhis perversity he is too modest to wear his hair long behind, as Homer\r\nmade the Abantes wear theirs.(780) And I have with me at my court two or\r\nthree men also who are not at all inferior to him, nay four or even five\r\nnow, if you please.)\r\n\r\nὉ δέ μοι θεῖος καὶ ὁμώνυμος οὐ δικαιότατα μὲν ὑμῶν προύστη, μέχρις\r\nἐπέτρεπον οἱ θεοὶ ξυνεῖναι ἡμῖν αὐτὸν καὶ ξυμπράττειν; οὐ προμηθέστατα δὲ\r\nπάσαις ἐπεξῆλθε ταῖς οἰκονομίαις τῆς πόλεως; ἡμῖν μὲν οὖν ἐδόκει ταῦτα\r\nκαλά, πρᾳότης ἀρχόντων μετὰ σωφροσύνης, [D] ᾠόμεθά τε ὑμῖν ἱκανῶς διὰ\r\nτούτων καλοὶ φανεῖσθαι τῶν ἐπιτηδευμάτων. ἐπεὶ δὲ ὑμᾶς ἥ τε βαθύτης\r\nἀπαρέσκει τοῦ γενείου καὶ τὸ ἀτημέλητον τῶν τριχῶν καὶ τὸ μὴ παραβάλλειν\r\nτοῖς θεάτροις καὶ τὸ ἀξιοῦν ἐν τοῖς ἱεροῖς εἶναι σεμνοὺς καὶ πρὸ τούτων\r\nἁπάντων ἡ περὶ τὰς κρίσεις ἡμῶν ἀσχολία καὶ τὸ τῆς ἀγορᾶς εἴργειν τὴν\r\nπλεονεξίαν, [366] ἑκόντες ὑμῖν ἐξιστάμεθα τῆς πόλεως. οὐ γὰρ οἶμαι ῥᾴδιον\r\nἐν γήρᾳ μεταθεμένῳ διαφυγεῖν τὸν λεγόμενον ὑπὲρ τοῦ ἰκτῖνος μῦθον. λέγεται\r\nγάρ τοι τὸν ἰκτῖνα φωνὴν ἔχοντα παραπλησίαν τοῖς ἄλλοις ὄρνισιν ἐπιθέσθαι\r\nτῷ χρεμετίζειν, ὥσπερ οἱ γενναῖοι τῶν ἵππων, εἶτα τοῦ μὲν ἐπιλαθόμενον, τὸ\r\nδὲ οὐ δυνηθέντα ἑλεῖν ἱκανῶς ἀμφοῖν στέρεσθαι καὶ φαυλοτέραν τῶν ἄλλων\r\nὀρνίθων εἶναι τὴν φωνήν.

Did he not with the utmost foresight administer all the business of\r\nthe city? For my part I thought these were admirable things, I mean\r\nmildness and moderation in those who govern, and I supposed that by\r\npractising these I should appear admirable in your eyes. But since the\r\nlength of my beard is displeasing to you, and my unkempt locks, and the\r\nfact that I do not put in an appearance at the theatres and that I require\r\nmen to be reverent in the temples; and since more than all these things my\r\nconstant attendance at trials displeases you and the fact that I try to\r\nbanish greed of gain from the market‐place, I willingly go away and leave\r\nyour city to you. For when a man changes his habits in his old age it is\r\nnot easy, I think, for him to escape the fate that is described in the\r\nlegend about the kite. The story goes that the kite once had a note like\r\nthat of other birds, but it aimed at neighing like a high‐spirited horse;\r\nthen since it forgot its former note and could not quite attain to the\r\nother sound, it was deprived of both, and hence the note it now utters is\r\nless musical than that of any other bird. This then is the fate that I am\r\ntrying to avoid, I mean failing to be either really boorish or really\r\naccomplished. For already, as you can see for yourselves, I am, since\r\nHeaven so wills, near the age)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Εὖτέ μοι λευκαὶ μελαίνοις ἀναμεμίξονται τρίχες,\r\n\r\n    (“When on my head white hairs mingle with black,”)\r\n\r\n\r\nὁ Τήιος ἔφη ποιητής.\r\n\r\n(as the poet of Teos said.(782))\r\n\r\nΕἶεν. ἀλλὰ τῆς ἀχαριστίας, πρὸς θεῶν καὶ Διὸς ἀγοραίου καὶ πολιούχου,\r\nὑπόσχετε λόγον. ἠδίκησθέ τι παρ᾽ ἐμοῦ κοινῇ πώποτε ἢ καὶ(783) ἰδίᾳ, [C]\r\nκαὶ δίκην ὑπὲρ τούτου λαβεῖν οὐ δυνάμενοι φανερῶς διὰ τῶν ἀναπαίστων ἡμᾶς,\r\nὥσπερ οἱ κωμῳδοὶ τὸν Ἡρακλέα καὶ τὸν Διόνυσον ἕλκουσι καὶ περιφέρουσιν,\r\nοὕτω δὲ καὶ ὑμεῖς ἐν ταῖς ἀγοραῖς ἐπιτρίβετε λοιδοροῦντες; ἢ τοῦ μὲν\r\nποιεῖν τι χαλεπὸν εἰς ὑμᾶς ἀπεσχόμην, τοῦ λέγειν δὲ ὑμᾶς κακῶς οὐκ\r\nἀπεσχόμην, ἵνα με καὶ ὑμεῖς διὰ τῶν αὐτῶν ἰόντες ἀμύνησθε; τίς οὖν ὑμῖν\r\nἐστιν αἰτία τοῦ πρὸς ἡμᾶς προσκρούσματος καὶ τῆς ἀπεχθείας; ἐγὼ γὰρ εὖ\r\nοἶδα δεινὸν [D] οὐδένα ὑμῶν οὐδὲν οὐδὲ ἀνήκεστον ἐργασάμενος οὔτε ἰδίᾳ\r\nτοὺς ἄνδρας οὔτε κοινῇ τὴν πόλιν, οὐδ᾽ εἰπὼν οὐδὲν φλαῦρον, ἀλλὰ καὶ\r\nἐπαινέσας, ὡς ἔδοξέ μοι προσήκειν, καὶ μεταδοὺς χρηστοῦ τινος, ὅσον εἰκὸς\r\nἦν τὸν ἐπιθυμοῦντα μετὰ τοῦ δυνατοῦ πολλοὺς εὖ ποιεῖν ἀνθρώπους. ἀδύνατον\r\nδ᾽ εὖ ἴστε καὶ τοῖς εἰσφέρουσι συγχωρεῖν ἅπαντα [367] καὶ διδόναι πάντα\r\nτοῖς εἰωθόσι λαμβάνειν. ὅταν οὖν φανῶ μηδὲν ἐλαττώσας τῶν δημοσίων\r\nσυντάξεων, ὅσας εἴωθεν ἡ βασιλικὴ νέμειν δαπάνη, ὑμῖν δ᾽ ἀνεὶς τῶν\r\nεἰσφορῶν οὐκ ὀλίγα, ἆρ᾽ οὐκ αἰνύγματι τὸ πρᾶγμα ἔοικεν;\r\n\r\n(Enough of that. But now, in the name of Zeus, God of the Market‐place and\r\nGuardian of the City, render me account of your ingratitude. Were you ever\r\nwronged by me in any way, either all in common or as individuals, and is\r\nit because you were unable to avenge yourselves openly that you now assail\r\nme with abuse in your market‐places in anapaestic verse, just as comedians\r\ndrag Heracles and Dionysus on the stage and make a public show of\r\nthem?(784) Or can you say that, though I refrained from any harsh conduct\r\ntowards you, I did not refrain from speaking ill of you, so that you, in\r\nyour turn, are defending yourselves by the same methods? What, I ask, is\r\nthe reason of your antagonism and your hatred of me? For I am very sure\r\nthat I had done no terrible or incurable injury to any one of you, either\r\nseparately, as individuals, or to your city as a whole; nor had I uttered\r\nany disparaging word, but I had even praised you, as I thought I was bound\r\nto do, and had bestowed on you certain advantages, as was natural for one\r\nwho desires, as far as he can, to benefit many men. But it is impossible,\r\nas you know well, both to remit all their taxes to the taxpayers and to\r\ngive everything to those who are accustomed to receive gifts. Therefore\r\nwhen it is seen that I have diminished none of the public subscriptions\r\nwhich the imperial purse is accustomed to contribute, but have remitted\r\nnot a few of your taxes, does not this business seem like a riddle?)\r\n\r\nἈλλ᾽ ὁπόσα μὲν κοινῇ πρὸς πάντας πεποίηται τοὺς ἀρχομένους ὑπ᾽ ἐμοῦ,\r\nπρέποι ἂν σιωπᾶν, ἵνα μὴ δοκοίην ὥσπερ [B] ἐξεπίτηδες αὐτοπρόσωπος\r\nἐπαίνους ᾄδειν ἐμαυτοῦ, καὶ ταῦτα ἐπαγγειλάμενος πολλὰς καὶ ἀσελγεστάτας\r\nὕβρεις καταχέαι· τὰ δὲ ἰδίᾳ μοι πρὸς ὑμᾶς πεποιημένα προπετῶς μὲν καὶ\r\nἀνοήτως, ἥκιστα δὲ ὑφ᾽ ὑμῶν ἄξια ἀχαριστεῖσθαι, πρέποι ἂν οἶμαι προφέρειν\r\nὥσπερ τινὰ ἐμὰ ὀνείδη τοσούτῳ τῶν ἔμπροσθεν χαλεπώτερα, τοῦ τε αὐχμοῦ τοῦ\r\nπερὶ τὸ πρόσωπον καὶ τῆς ἀναφροδισίας, ὅσῳ καὶ ἀληθέστερα ὄντα τῇ ψυχῇ\r\nμάλιστα προσήκει.

But as for\r\nmy actions with respect to you as individuals, which, though the manner of\r\nthem was rash and foolish, nevertheless did not by any means deserve to be\r\nrepaid by you with ingratitude, it would, I think, be becoming for me to\r\nbring them forward as reproaches against myself; and these reproaches\r\nought to be more severe than those I uttered before, I mean those that\r\nrelated to my unkempt appearance and my lack of charm, inasmuch as they\r\nare more genuine since they have especial reference to the soul. I mean\r\nthat before I came here I used to praise you in the strongest possible\r\nterms, without waiting to have actual experience of you, nor did I\r\nconsider how we should feel towards one another; nay, since I thought that\r\nyou were sons of Greeks, and I myself, though my family is Thracian, am a\r\nGreek in my habits, I supposed that we should regard one another with the\r\ngreatest possible affection. This example of my rashness must therefore be\r\ncounted as one reproach against me. Next, after you had sent an embassy to\r\nme—and it arrived not only later than all the other embassies, but even\r\nlater than that of the Alexandrians who dwell in Egypt,—I remitted large\r\nsums of gold and of silver also, and all the tribute money for you\r\nseparately apart from the other cities; and moreover I increased the\r\nregister of your Senate by two hundred members and spared no man;(785) for\r\nI was planning to make your city greater and more powerful.)\r\n\r\nΔέδωκα οὖν ὑμῖν καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἐπιτροπευσάντων τοὺς θησαυροὺς τοὺς ἐμοὺς\r\n[368] καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἐργασαμένων τὸ νόμισμα τοὺς πλουσιωτάτους ἑλομένοις\r\nἔχειν· ὑμεῖς δ᾽ ἐκείνων μεν οὐ τοὺς δυναμένους εἵλεσθε, λαβόμενοι δὲ τῆς\r\nἀφορμῆς εἰργάσασθε παραπλήσια πόλει μὲν οὐδαμῶς εὐνομουμένῃ, πρέποντα δ᾽\r\nὑμῶν ἄλλως τῷ τρόπῳ. βούλεσθε ἑνὸς ὑμᾶς ὑπομνήσω; βουλευτὴν ὀνομάσαντες,\r\nπρὶν προσγραφῆναι τῷ καταλόγῳ, μετεώρου τῆς δίκης οὔσης, ὑπεβάλετε\r\nλειτουργίᾳ τὸν ἄνθρωπον. ἄλλον ἀπ᾽ ἀγορᾶς [B] εἱλκύσατε πένητα καὶ ἐκ τῶν\r\nἁπανταχοῦ μὲν ἀπολελειμμένων, παρ᾽ ὑμῖν δὲ διὰ περιττὴν φρόνησιν\r\nἀμειβομένων πρὸς χρυσίον συρφετῶν εὐποροῦντα μετρίας οὐσίας εἵλεσθε\r\nκοινωνόν. πολλὰ τοιαῦτα περὶ τὰς ὀνομασίας κακουργούντων ὑμῶν, ἐπειδὴ μὴ\r\nπρὸς ἅπαντα συνεχωρήσαμεν, ὧν τε εὖ εἰργασάμεθα τὴν χάριν ἀπεστερήθημεν,\r\nκαὶ ὧν ἀπεσχόμεθα ξὺν δίκῃ παρ᾽ ὑμῶν δυσχεραινόμεθα.\r\n\r\n(I therefore gave you the opportunity to elect and to have in your Senate\r\nthe richest men among those who administer my own revenues and have charge\r\nof coining the currency. You however did not elect the capable men among\r\nthese, but you seized the opportunity to act like a city by no means well‐\r\nordered, though quite in keeping with your character. Would you like me to\r\nremind you of a single instance? You nominated a Senator, and then before\r\nhis name had been placed on the register, and the scrutiny of his\r\ncharacter was still pending, you thrust this person into the public\r\nservice. Then you dragged in another from the market‐place, a man who was\r\npoor and who belonged to a class which in every other city is counted as\r\nthe very dregs, but who among you, since of your excessive wisdom you\r\nexchange rubbish for gold, enjoys a moderate fortune; and this man you\r\nelected as your colleague. Many such offences did you commit with regard\r\nto the nominations, and then when I did not consent to everything, not\r\nonly was I deprived of the thanks due for all the good I had done, but\r\nalso I have incurred your dislike on account of all that I in justice\r\nrefrained from.)\r\n\r\n[C] Καὶ ταῦτα μὲν ἦν τῶν μικρῶν πάνυ καὶ οὔπω δυνάμενα τὴν πόλιν\r\nἐκπολεμῶσαι· τὸ δὲ δὴ μέγιστον, ἐξ οὗ τὸ μέγα ἤρθη μῖσος, ἀφικομένου μου\r\nπρὸς ὑμᾶς ὁ δῆμος ἐν τῷ θεάτρῳ, πνιγόμενος ὑπὸ τῶν πλουσίων, ἀφῆκε φωνὴν\r\nπρῶτον ταύτην· “Πάντα γέμει, πάντα πολλοῦ.” τῆς ἐπιούσης διελέχθην ἐγὼ\r\nτοῖς δυνατοῖς ὑμῶν ἐπιχειρῶν πείθειν, [D] ὅτι κρεῖττόν ἐστιν ὑπεριδόντας\r\nἀδίκου κτήσεως εὖ ποιῆσαι πολίτας καὶ ξένους. οἱ δὲ ἐπαγγειλάμενοι τοῦ\r\nπράγματος ἐπιμελήσεσθαι μηνῶν ἑξῆς τριῶν ὑπεριδόντος μου καὶ περιμείναντος\r\nοὕτως ὀλιγῶρως εἶχον τοῦ πράγματος, ὡς οὐδεὶς ἂν ἤλπισεν. ἐπεὶ δ᾽ ἑώρων\r\nἀληθῆ τὴν τοῦ δήμου φωνὴν καὶ τὴν ἀγορὰν οὐχ ὑπ᾽ ἐνδείας, ἀλλ᾽ ὑπ᾽\r\nἀπληστίας [369] τῶν κεκτημένων στενοχωρουμένην, ἕταξα μέτριον ἑκάστου\r\nτίμημα καὶ δῆλον ἐποίησα πᾶσιν. ἐπεὶ δ᾽ ἦν τὰ μὲν ἄλλα παρ᾽ αὐτοῖς πολλὰ\r\nπάνυ· καὶ γὰρ ἦν οἶνος καὶ ἔλαιον καὶ τὰ λοιπὰ πάντα· σίτου δ᾽ ἐνδεῶς\r\nεἶχον, ἀφορίας δεινῆς ὑπὸ τῶν ἔμπροσθεν αὐχμῶν γενομένης, ἔδοξέ μοι\r\nπέμπειν εἰς Χαλκίδα καὶ Ἱερὰν πόλιν καὶ πόλεις τὰς πέριξ, ἔνθεν εἰσήγαγον\r\nὑμῖν μέτρων τετταράκοντα μυριάδας. ὡς δ᾽ ἀνάλωτο καὶ τοῦτο, πρότερον μὲν\r\nπεντάκις χιλίους, [B] ἑπτάκις χιλίους δ᾽ ὕστερον, εἶτα νῦν μυρίους, οὓς\r\nἐπιχώριόν ἐστι λοιπὸν ὀνομάζειν μοδίους, ἀνάλισκον σίτου, πάντας οἴκοθεν\r\nἔχων. ἀπὸ τῆς Αἰγύπτου κομισθέντα μοι σῖτον ἔδωκα τῇ πόλει, πραττόμενος\r\nἀργύριον οὐκ ἐπὶ δέκα μέτρων,(786) ἀλλὰ πεντεκαίδεκα τοσοῦτον, ὅσον ἐπὶ\r\nτῶν δέκα πρότερον. εἰ δὲ τοσαῦτα μέτρα θέρους ἦν παρ᾽ ὑμῖν τοῦ νομίσματος,\r\nτί προσδοκᾶν ἔδει τηνικαῦτα, ἡνίκα, φησὶν ὁ Βοιώτιος ποιητής, [C] χαλεπὸν\r\nγενέσθαι τὸν λιμὸν ἐπὶ δώματι; ἆρ᾽ οὐ πέντε μόγις καὶ ἀγαπητῶς ἄλλως τε\r\nκαὶ τηλικούτου χειμῶνος ἐπιγενομένου;\r\n\r\n(Now these were very trivial matters and could not so far make the city\r\nhostile to me. But my greatest offence of all, and what aroused that\r\nviolent hatred of yours, was the following. When I arrived among you the\r\npopulace in the theatre, who were being oppressed by the rich, first of\r\nall cried aloud, “Everything plentiful; everything dear!” On the following\r\nday I had an interview with your powerful citizens and tried to persuade\r\nthem that it is better to despise unjust profits and to benefit the\r\ncitizens and the strangers in your city. And they promised to take charge\r\nof the matter, but though for three successive months I took no notice and\r\nwaited, they neglected the matter in a way that no one would have thought\r\npossible. And when I saw that there was truth in the outcry of the\r\npopulace, and that the pressure in the market was due not to any scarcity\r\nbut to the insatiate greed of the rich, I appointed a fair price for\r\neverything, and made it known to all men. And since the citizens had\r\neverything else in great abundance, wine, for instance, and olive oil and\r\nall the rest, but were short of corn, because there had been a terrible\r\nfailure of the crops owing to the previous droughts, I decided to send to\r\nChalcis and Hierapolis and the cities round about, and from them I\r\nimported for you four hundred thousand measures of corn. And when this too\r\nhad been used, I first expended five thousand, then later seven thousand,\r\nand now again ten thousand bushels—“modii”(787) as they are called in my\r\ncountry—all of which was my very own property; moreover I gave to the city\r\ncorn which had been brought for me from Egypt; and the price which I set\r\non it was a silver piece, not for ten measures but for fifteen, that is to\r\nsay, the same amount that had formerly been paid for ten measures. And if\r\nin summer, in your city, that same number of measures is sold for that\r\nsum, what could you reasonably have expected at the season when, as the\r\nBoeotian poet says, “It is a cruel thing for famine to be in the\r\nhouse.”(788) Would you not have been thankful to get five measures for\r\nthat sum, especially when the winter had set in so severe?)\r\n\r\nΤί οὖν ὑμῶν οἱ πλούσιοι; τὸν μὲν ἐπὶ τῶν ἀγρῶν σίτον λάθρᾳ ἀπέδοντο\r\nπλείονος, ἐβάρησαν δὲ τὸ κοινὸν τοῖς ἰδίοις ἀναλώμασι· καὶ οὐχ ἡ πόλις\r\nμόνον ἐπὶ τοῦτο συρρεῖ, [D] οἱ πλεῖστοι δὲ καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἀγρῶν συντρέχουσιν,\r\nὃ μόνον ἐστὶν εὑρεῖν πολὺ καὶ εὔωνον, ἄρτους ὠνούμενοι. καίτοι τίς\r\nμέμνηται παρ᾽ ὑμῖν εὐθηνουμένης τῆς πόλεως πεντεκαίδεκα μέτρα σίτου\r\nπραθέντα τοῦ χρυσοῦ; ταύτης ἕνεκεν ὑμῖν ἀπηχθόμην ἐγὼ τῆς πράξεως, ὅτι τὸν\r\nοἶνον ὑμῖν οὐκ ἐπέτρεψα καὶ τὰ λάχανα καὶ τὰς ὀπώρας ἀποδόσθαι χρυσοῦ, καὶ\r\nτὸν ὑπὸ τῶν πλουσίων ἀποκεκλεισμένον ἐν ταῖς ἀποθήκαις σῖτον ἄργυρον\r\nαὐτοῖς [370] καὶ χρυσὸν ἐξαίφνης παρ᾽ ὑμῶν γενέσθαι. ἐκεῖνοι μὲν γὰρ αὐτὸν\r\nἔξω τῆς πόλεως διέθεντο καλῶς, ἐργασάμενοι τοῖς ἀνθρώποις λιμὸν ἀλοιητῆρα\r\nβρότειον, ὡς ὁ θεὸς ἔφη τοὺς ταῦτα ἐπιτηδεύοντας ἐξελέγχων. ἡ πόλις δ᾽ ἐν\r\nἀφθονίᾳ γέγονεν ἄρτων ἕνεκα μόνον, ἄλλου δ᾽ οὐδενός.\r\n\r\n(But what did your rich men do? They secretly sold the corn in the country\r\nfor an exaggerated price, and they oppressed the community by the expenses\r\nthat private persons had to incur. And the result is that not only the\r\ncity but most of the country people too are flocking in to buy bread,\r\nwhich is the only thing to be found in abundance and cheap. And indeed who\r\nremembers fifteen measures of corn to have been sold among you for a gold\r\npiece, even when the city was in a prosperous condition? It was for this\r\nconduct that I incurred your hatred, because I did not allow people to\r\nsell you wine and vegetables and fruit for gold, or the corn which had\r\nbeen locked away by the rich in their granaries to be suddenly converted\r\nby you into silver and gold for their benefit. For they managed the\r\nbusiness finely outside the city, and so procured for men “famine that\r\ngrinds down mortals,”(789) as the god said when he was accusing those who\r\nbehave in this fashion. And the city now enjoys plenty only as regards\r\nbread, and nothing else.)\r\n\r\n[B] Συνίην μὲν οὖν καὶ τότε ταῦτα ποιῶν ὅτι μὴ πᾶσιν ἀρέσοιμι, πλὴν ἔμελεν\r\nοὐδὲν ἐμοί· τῷ γὰρ ἀδικουμένῳ πλήθει βοηθεῖν ᾤμην χρῆναι καὶ τοῖς\r\nἀφικνουμένοις ξένοις, ἐμοῦ τε ἕνεκα καὶ τῶν συνόντων ἡμῖν ἀρχόντων. ἐπεὶ\r\nδ᾽ οἶμαι συμβαίνει τοὺς μὲν ἀπιέναι, τὴν πόλιν δ᾽ εἶναι τὰ πρὸς ἐμὲ γνώμης\r\nμιᾶς· οἱ μὲν γὰρ μισοῦσιν, οἱ δ᾽ ὑπ᾽ ἐμοῦ τραφέντες ἀχαριστοῦσιν·\r\nἈδραστείᾳ πάντα ἐπιτρέψας ἐς ἄλλο ἔθνος οἰχήσομαι καὶ δῆμον ἕτερον, οὐδὲν\r\nὑμᾶς ὑπομνήσας [C] ὧν ἐνιαυτοῖς ἔμπροσθεν ἐννέα δίκαια δρῶντες εἰς\r\nἀλλήλους εἰργάσασθε, φέρων μὲν ὁ δῆμος ἐπὶ τὰς οἰκίας τῶν δυνατῶν ξὺν βοῇ\r\nτὴν φλόγα καὶ ἀποκτιννὺς τὸν ἄρχοντα, δίκην δ᾽ αὖθις ἀποτίνων ὑπὲρ τούτων,\r\nὧν ὀργιζόμενος δικαίως ἔπραξεν οὐκέτι μετρίως.\r\n\r\n(Now I knew even then when I acted thus that I should not please\r\neverybody, only I cared nothing about that. For I thought it was my duty\r\nto assist the mass of the people who were being wronged, and the strangers\r\nwho kept arriving in the city both on my account and on account of the\r\nhigh officials who were with me. But since it is now, I think, the case\r\nthat the latter have departed, and the city is of one mind with respect to\r\nme—for some of you hate me and the others whom I fed are ungrateful—I\r\nleave the whole matter in the hands of Adrasteia(790) and I will betake\r\nmyself to some other nation and to citizens of another sort. Nor will I\r\neven remind you how you treated one another when you asserted your rights\r\nnine years ago; how the populace with loud clamour set fire to the houses\r\nof those in power, and murdered the Governor; and how later they were\r\npunished for these things because, though their anger was justified, what\r\nthey did exceeded all limits.(791))\r\n\r\nὝπὲρ τίνος οὖν πρὸς θεῶν ἀχαριστούμεθα; ὅτι τρέφομεν ὑμᾶς οἴκοθεν, [D] ὃ\r\nμέχρι σήμερον ὑπῆρξεν οὐδεμιᾷ πόλει, καὶ τρέφομεν οὕτω λαμπρῶς; ὅτι τὸν\r\nκατάλογον ὑμῶν ηὐξήσαμεν; ὅτι κλέπτοντας ἑλόντες οὐκ ἐπεξήλθομεν; ἑνὸς ἢ\r\nδύο βούλεσθε ὑμᾶς ὑπομνήσω, μή τις ὑπολάβῃ σχῆμα καὶ ῥητορείαν εἶναι καὶ\r\nπροσποίησιν τὸ πρᾶγμα; γῆς κλήρους οἶμαι τρισχιλίους ἔφατε ἀσπόρους εἶναι\r\nκαὶ ᾐτήσασθε λαβεῖν, λαβόντες δ᾽ ἐνείμασθε πάντες οἱ μὴ δεόμενοι. τοῦτο\r\nἐξετασθὲν ἀνεφάνη σαφῶς. ἀφελόμενος δ᾽ αὐτοὺς ἐγὼ τῶν ἐχόντον οὐ δικαίως,\r\nκαὶ πολυπραγμονήσας οὐδὲν ὑπὲρ τῶν ἔμπροσθεν, ὧν ἔσχον ἀτελεῖς, [371] οὓς\r\nμάλιστα ἐχρῆν ὑποτελεῖς εἶναι, ταῖς βαρυτάταις ἔνειμα λειτουργίαις αὐτοὺς\r\nτῆς πόλεως. καὶ νῦν ἀτελεῖς ἔχουσιν οἱ καθ᾽ ἕκαστον ὑμῖν ἐνιαυτὸν\r\nἱπποτροφοῦντες γῆς κλήρους ἐγγὺς τρισχιλίους, ἐπινοίᾳ μὲν καὶ οἰκονομίᾳ\r\nτοῦ θείου τοὐμοῦ καὶ ὁμωνύμου, χάριτι δ᾽ ἐμῇ, ὃς δὴ τοὺς πανούργους καὶ\r\nκλέπτας οὕτω κολάζων εἰκότως ὑμῖν φαίνομαι τὸν κόσμον ἀνατρέπειν. [B] εὖ\r\nγὰρ ἴστε ὅτι πρὸς τοὺς τοιούτους ἡ πρᾳότης αὔξει καὶ τρέφει τὴν ἐν τοῖς\r\nἀνθρώποις κακίαν.\r\n\r\n(Why, I repeat, in Heaven’s name, am I treated with ingratitude? Is it\r\nbecause I feed you from my own purse, a thing which before this day has\r\nnever happened to any city, and moreover feed you so generously? Is it\r\nbecause I increased the register of Senators? Or because, when I caught\r\nyou in the act of stealing, I did not proceed against you? Let me, if you\r\nplease, remind you of one or two instances, so that no one may think that\r\nwhat I say is a pretext or mere rhetoric or a false claim. You said, I\r\nthink, that three thousand lots of land were uncultivated, and you asked\r\nto have them; and when you had got them you all divided them among you\r\nthough you did not need them. This matter was investigated and brought to\r\nlight beyond doubt. Then I took the lots away from those who held them\r\nunjustly, and made no inquiries about the lands which they had before\r\nacquired, and for which they paid no taxes, though they ought most\r\ncertainly to have been taxed, and I appointed these men to the most\r\nexpensive public services in the city. And even now they who breed horses\r\nfor you every year hold nearly three thousand lots of land exempt from\r\ntaxation. This is due in the first place to the judgment and management of\r\nmy uncle and namesake(792) but also to my own kindness; and since this is\r\nthe way in which I punish rascals and thieves, I naturally seem to you to\r\nbe turning the world upside down. For you know very well that clemency\r\ntowards men of this sort increases and fosters wickedness among mankind.)\r\n\r\nὉ λόγος οὖν μοι καὶ ἐνταῦθα περιίσταται πάλιν εἰς ὅπερ βούλομαι. πάντων\r\nγὰρ ἐμαυτῷ τῶν κακῶν αἴτιος γίγνομαι εἰς ἀχάριστα καταθέμενος ἤθη τὰς\r\nχάριτας. ἀνοίας οὖν ἐστι τῆς ἐμῆς τοῦτο καὶ οὐ τῆς ὑμετέρας ἐλευθερίας.\r\nἐγὼ μὲν δὴ τὰ πρὸς ὑμᾶς εἶναι πειράσομαι τοῦ λοιποῦ συνετώτερος· ὑμῖν [C]\r\nδὲ οἱ θεοὶ τῆς εἰς ἡμᾶς εὐνοίας καὶ τιμῆς, ἣν ἐτιμήσατε δημοσίᾳ, τὰς\r\nἀμοιβὰς ἀποδοῖεν.\r\n\r\n(Well then, my discourse has now come round again to the point which I\r\nwished to arrive at. I mean to say that I am myself responsible for all\r\nthe wrong that has been done to me, because I transformed your\r\ngraciousness to ungracious ways. This therefore is the fault of my own\r\nfolly and not of your licence. For the future therefore in my dealings\r\nwith you I indeed shall endeavour to be more sensible: but to you, in\r\nreturn for your good will towards me and the honour wherewith you have\r\npublicly
