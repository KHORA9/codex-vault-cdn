They will say that their only use is to repeat them after\r\nsome unhappy wight has \"gone wrong.\" When, for instance, a man has\r\nplayed \"ducks and drakes\" with his money, the fact at once calls up\r\nthe proverb which declares that \"wilful waste leads to woful want\";\r\nbut did not the \"waster\" know this well-worn saying from his early\r\nyears _downwards_? What good, then, did it do him? Again, how many\r\nhave been benefited by the saying of the ancient Greek poet, that\r\n\"evil communications corrupt good manners\"?--albeit they had it\r\nfrequently before them in their school \"copy-books.\" Are the maxims\r\nof morality useless, then, because they are so much disregarded?\r\n\r\nWhen a man has reached middle-age he generally feels with tenfold\r\nforce the truth of those \"sayings of the wise\" which he learned in\r\nhis early years, and has cause to regret, as well as wonder, that he\r\nhad not all along followed their wholesome teaching. For it is to\r\nthe young, who are about to cross the threshold of active life, that\r\nsuch terse convincing sentences are more especially addressed, and,\r\nspite of the proverbial heedlessness of youth, there will be found\r\nmany who are not deaf to this kind of instruction, if their moral\r\nenvironment be favourable. But, even after the spring-time of youth\r\nis past, there are occasions when the mind is peculiarly susceptible\r\nto the force of a pithy maxim, which may tend to the reforming of\r\none's way of life. There is commonly more practical wisdom in a\r\nstriking aphorism than in a round dozen of \"goody\" books--that is to\r\nsay, books which are not good in the highest sense, because their\r\nthemes are overlaid with commonplace and wearisome reflections.\r\n\r\nMay we not find the \"whole duty of man\" condensed into a few brief\r\nsentences, which have been expressed by thoughtful men in all ages\r\nand in countries far apart?--such as: \"Love thy neighbour as\r\nthyself,\" \"Do unto others as ye would that they should do unto you.\"\r\nThe chief themes of all teachers of morality are: benevolence and\r\nbeneficence; tolerance of the opinions of others; self-control; the\r\nacquisition of knowledge--that jewel beyond price; the true uses of\r\nwealth; the advantages of resolute, manly exertion; the dignity of\r\nlabour; the futility of worldly pleasures; the fugacity of time;\r\nman's individual insignificance. They are never weary of inculcating\r\ntaciturnity in preference to loquacity, and the virtues of patience\r\nand resignation. They iterate and reiterate the fact that true\r\nhappiness is to be found only in contentment; and they administer\r\nconsolation and infuse hope by reminding us that as dark days are\r\nfollowed by bright days, so times of bitter adversity are followed\r\nby seasons of sweet prosperity; and thus, like the immortal Sir\r\nHudibras, when \"in doleful dumps\", we may \"cheer ourselves with ends\r\nof verse, and sayings of philosophers.\"\r\n\r\nIn the following small selection of aphorisms, a considerable\r\nproportion are drawn from Eastern literature. Indian wisdom is\r\nrepresented by passages from the great epics, the _Mahábhárata_ and\r\nthe _Rámáyana_; the _Panchatantra_ and the _Hitopadesa_, two\r\nSanskrit versions of the famous collection of apologues known in\r\nEurope as the Fables of Bidpaï, or Pilpay; the _Dharma-sastra_ of\r\nManu; Bháravi, Mágha, Bhartrihari, and other Hindu poets. Specimens\r\nof the mild teachings of Buddha and his more notable followers are\r\ntaken from the _Dhammapada_ (Path of Virtue) and other canonical\r\nworks; pregnant sayings of the Jewish Fathers, from the Talmud;\r\nMoslem moral philosophy is represented by extracts from Arabic and\r\nPersian writers (among the great poets of Persia are, Firdausí,\r\nSa'dí, Háfiz, Nizámí, Omar Khayyám, Jámí); while the proverbial\r\nwisdom of the Chinese and the didactic writings of the sages of\r\nBurmah are also occasionally cited.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary reader will probably be somewhat surprised to discover\r\nin the aphorisms of the ancient Greeks and Hindus several close\r\nparallels to the doctrines of the Old and New Testaments, and he\r\nwill have reasoned justly if he conclude that the so-called\r\n\"heathens\" could have derived their spiritual light only from the\r\nsame Source as that which inspired the Hebrew prophets and the\r\nChristian apostles.\r\n\r\nAmong English writers of aphorisms Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam, is\r\npre-eminent, but none of his pithy sentences find place here,\r\nbecause they are procurable in many inexpensive forms, (_e.g._,\r\n_Counsels from my Lord Bacon_, 1892), and must be familiar to what is\r\ntermed \"the average general reader.\" _The Enchiridion_ of Frances\r\nQuarles and the _Resolves_ of Owen Feltham are, however, laid under\r\ncontribution, as also Robert Chamberlain, an author who is probably\r\nunknown to many pluming themselves on their thorough acquaintance\r\nwith English literature, some of whose aphorisms (published in 1638,\r\nunder the title of _Nocturnal Lucubrations_) I have deemed worthy of\r\nreproduction.\r\n\r\nIn more modern times, with the sole exception of William Hazlitt,\r\nour country has produced no very successful writer of aphorisms.\r\nColton's _Lacon; or, Many Things in Few Words, Addressed to Those\r\nwho Think_, went through several editions soon after its first\r\npublication in 1820; it is described by Mr. John Morley--and not\r\nunfairly--as being \"so vapid, so wordy, so futile as to have a place\r\namong those books which dispense with parody\"; it is \"an awful\r\nexample to anyone who is tempted to try his hand at an aphorism.\"\r\nMr. Morley is hardly less severe in speaking of the \"Thoughts\" in\r\n_Theophrastus Such_: \"the most insufferable of all deadly-lively\r\nprosing in our sublunary world.\" However this may be, assuredly\r\nother works of the author of _Adam Bede_ will be found to furnish\r\nmany examples of admirable apothegms.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to add that, bearing in mind that a great collection\r\nof gravities commonly proves quite as wearisome reading as a large\r\ncompilation of gaieties, or facetiæ, I have confined my selection of\r\n\"sayings of the wise\" within the limits of a pocket-volume.\r\n\r\n                                                        W.

Goldsmith:\r\n\r\n          O Memory! thou fond deceiver,\r\n            Still importunate and vain;\r\n          To former joys recurring ever,\r\n            And turning all the past to pain.\r\n\r\n\r\n7.\r\n\r\nWe in reality only know when we doubt a little. With knowledge comes\r\ndoubt.\r\n\r\n                                                       _Goethe._\r\n\r\n\r\n8.\r\n\r\nIn the hour of adversity be not without hope, for crystal rain falls\r\nfrom black clouds.\r\n\r\n                                                       _Nizámí._\r\n\r\n\r\n9.\r\n\r\nOne common origin unites us all, but every sort of wood does not\r\ngive the perfume of the lignum aloes.\r\n\r\n                                                       _Arabic._\r\n\r\n\r\n10.\r\n\r\nI asked an experienced elder who had profited by his knowledge of\r\nthe world, \"What course should I pursue to obtain prosperity?\" He\r\nreplied, \"Contentment--if you are able, practise contentment.\"\r\n\r\n                                                       _Selman._\r\n\r\n\r\n11.\r\n\r\nEvery moment that a man may be in want of employment, than such I\r\nhold him to be far better who is forced to labour for nothing.\r\n\r\n                                                       _Afghan._\r\n\r\n\r\n12.\r\n\r\nThe foolish undertake a trifling act, and soon desist, discouraged;\r\nwise men engage in mighty works, and persevere.\r\n\r\n                                                        _Mágha._\r\n\r\n\r\n13.\r\n\r\nThose who wish well towards their friends disdain to please them\r\nwith words which are not true.\r\n\r\n                                                      _Bháravi._\r\n\r\n\r\n14.\r\n\r\nReason is captive in the hands of the passions, as a weak man in the\r\nhands of an artful woman.\r\n\r\n                                                        _Sa'dí._\r\n\r\n\r\n15.\r\n\r\nLike an earthen pot, a bad man is easily broken, and cannot readily\r\nbe restored to his former situation; but a virtuous man, like a vase\r\nof gold, is broken with difficulty, and easily repaired.\r\n\r\n                                                   _Hitopadesa._\r\n\r\n\r\n16.\r\n\r\nThe son who delights his father by his good actions; the wife who\r\nseeks only her husband's good; the friend who is the same in\r\nprosperity and adversity--these three things are the reward of\r\nvirtue.\r\n\r\n                                                  _Bhartrihari._\r\n\r\n\r\n17.\r\n\r\nLet us not overstrain our abilities, or we shall do nothing with\r\ngrace. A clown, whatever he may do, will never pass for a gentleman.\r\n\r\n                                                  _La Fontaine._\r\n\r\n\r\n18.\r\n\r\nTo abstain from speaking is regarded as very difficult. It is not\r\npossible to say much that is valuable and striking.[2]\r\n\r\n                                                  _Mahábhárata._\r\n\r\n    [2] Cf. James, III, 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n19.\r\n\r\nPagodas are, like mosques, true houses of prayer;\r\n'Tis prayer that church bells waft upon the air;\r\n  Kaaba and temple, rosary and cross,\r\nAll are but divers tongues of world-wide prayer.\r\n\r\n                                                 _Omar Khayyám._\r\n\r\n\r\n20.\r\n\r\nIn no wise ask about the faults of others, for he who reporteth the\r\nfaults of others will report thine also.\r\n\r\n                                                     _Firdausí._\r\n\r\n\r\n21.\r\n\r\nHe that holds fast the golden mean,\r\nAnd lives contentedly between\r\n  The little and the great,\r\nFeels not the wants that pinch the poor,\r\nNor plagues that haunt the rich man's door,\r\n  Embittering all his state.\r\n\r\n                                                       _Horace._\r\n\r\n\r\n22.\r\n\r\nNothing is more becoming a man than silence. It is not the preaching\r\nbut the practice which ought to be considered as the more important.\r\nA profusion of words is sure to lead to error.\r\n\r\n                                                       _Talmud._\r\n\r\n\r\n23.\r\n\r\nConsider, and you will find that almost all the transactions of the\r\ntime of Vespasian differed little from those of the present day. You\r\nthere find marrying and giving in marriage, educating children,\r\nsickness, death, war, joyous holidays, traffic, agriculture,\r\nflatterers, insolent pride, suspicions, laying of plots, longing for\r\nthe death of others, newsmongers, lovers, misers, men canvassing for\r\nconsulship--yet all these passed away, and are nowhere.\r\n\r\n                                                  _M. Aurelius._\r\n\r\n\r\n24.\r\n\r\nThe friendship of the bad is like the shade of some precipitous bank\r\nwith crumbling sides, which, falling, buries him who is beneath.\r\n\r\n                                                      _Bháravi._\r\n\r\n\r\n25.\r\n\r\nHis action no applause invites\r\nWho simply good with good repays;\r\n  He only justly merits praise\r\nWho wrongful deeds with kind requites.[3]\r\n\r\n                                                 _Panchatantra._\r\n\r\n    [3] Matt. V, 43, 44.\r\n\r\n\r\n26.\r\n\r\nDeath comes, and makes a man his prey,\r\n  A man whose powers are yet unspent;\r\n  Like one on gathering flowers intent,\r\nWhose thoughts are turned another way.\r\n\r\nBegin betimes to practise good,\r\n  Lest fate surprise thee unawares\r\n  Amid thy round of schemes and cares;\r\nTo-morrow's task to-day conclude.[4]\r\n\r\n                                                  _Mahábhárata._\r\n\r\n    [4] Eccles. IX, 10; XII, 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n27.\r\n\r\nLet a man's talents or virtues be what they may, we feel\r\nsatisfaction in his society only as he is satisfied in himself. We\r\ncannot enjoy the good qualities of a friend if he seems to be none\r\nthe better for them.\r\n\r\n                                                      _Hazlitt._\r\n\r\n\r\n28.\r\n\r\nIt was a false maxim of Domitian that he who would gain the people\r\nof Rome must promise all things and perform nothing. For when a man\r\nis known to be false in his word, instead of a column, which he\r\nmight be by keeping it, for others to rest upon, he becomes a reed,\r\nwhich no man will vouchsafe to lean upon. Like a floating island,\r\nwhen we come next day to seek it, it is carried from the place we\r\nleft it in, and, instead of earth to build upon, we find nothing but\r\ninconstant and deceiving waves.\r\n\r\n                                                      _Feltham._\r\n\r\n\r\n29.\r\n\r\nHe is not dead who departs this life with high fame; dead is he,\r\nthough living, whose brow is branded with infamy.\r\n\r\n                                                        _Tieck._\r\n\r\n\r\n30.\r\n\r\nIn the height of thy prosperity expect adversity, but fear it not.\r\nIf it come not, thou art the more sweetly possessed of the happiness\r\nthou hast, and the more strongly confirmed. If it come, thou art the\r\nmore gently dispossessed of the happiness thou hadst, and the more\r\nfirmly prepared.\r\n\r\n                                                      _Quarles._\r\n\r\n\r\n31.\r\n\r\nA prudent man will not discover his poverty, his self-torments, the\r\ndisorders of his house, his uneasiness, or his disgrace.\r\n\r\n                                                   _Hitopadesa._\r\n\r\n\r\n32.\r\n\r\nMen are of three different capacities: one understands intuitively;\r\nanother understands so far as it is explained; and a third\r\nunderstands neither of himself nor by explanation.

Your still fowl, blinking at you without remark, may all the\r\nwhile be sitting on one addled nest-egg; and, when it takes to\r\ncackling, will have nothing to announce but that addled delusion.\r\n\r\n                                                 _George Eliot._\r\n\r\n\r\n584.\r\n\r\nThe sage who engages in controversy with ignorant people must not\r\nexpect to be treated with honour; and if a fool should overpower a\r\nphilosopher by his loquacity it is not to be wondered at, for a\r\ncommon stone will break a jewel.\r\n\r\n                                                        _Sa'dí._\r\n\r\n\r\n585.\r\n\r\nSuccess is like a lovely woman, wooed by many men, but folded in the\r\narms of him alone who, free from over-zeal, firmly persists and\r\ncalmly perseveres.\r\n\r\n                                                      _Bháravi._\r\n\r\n\r\n586.\r\n\r\nA feverish display of over-zeal,\r\nAt the first outset, is an obstacle\r\nTo all success; water, however cold,\r\nWill penetrate the ground by slow degrees.\r\n\r\n                                                   _Hitopadesa._\r\n\r\n\r\n587.\r\n\r\nTreat no one with disdain; with patience bear\r\nReviling language; with an angry man\r\nBe never angry; blessings give for curses.[31]\r\n\r\n                                                         _Manu._\r\n\r\n    [31] Cf.
