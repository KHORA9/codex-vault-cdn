Some of the additions formed a Supplement to the original articles.\r\nThese supplementary paragraphs were, by the author, placed after those to\r\nwhich they respectively referred, being distinguished from the rest of the\r\ntext by brackets. I have omitted these brackets as useless, except where\r\nthey were needed to indicate subsequent writing.\r\n\r\nAnother and a larger portion of the work consists of discussion of matters\r\nof contemporary interest, for the Budget was in some degree a receptacle\r\nfor the author's thoughts on any literary, scientific, or social question.\r\nHaving grown thus gradually to its present size, the book as it was left\r\nwas not quite in a fit condition for publication, but the alterations which\r\nhave been made are slight and few, being in most cases verbal, and such as\r\nthe sense absolutely required, or transpositions of sentences to secure\r\ncoherence with the rest, in places where the author, in his more recent\r\ninsertion of them, had overlooked the connection in which they stood. In no\r\ncase has the meaning been in any degree modified or interfered with.\r\n\r\nOne rather large omission must be mentioned here. It is an account of the\r\nquarrel between Sir James South and Mr. Troughton on the mounting, etc. of\r\nthe equatorial telescope at Campden Hill. At some future time when the\r\naffair has passed entirely out of the memory of living Astronomers, the\r\nappreciative sketch, which is omitted in this edition of the Budget, will\r\nbe an interesting piece of history and study of character.[1]\r\n\r\nA very small portion of Mr. James Smith's circle-squaring has been left\r\nout, with a still smaller portion of Mr. De Morgan's answers to that\r\nCyclometrical Paradoxer.\r\n\r\nIn more than one place repetitions, which would have disappeared under the\r\nauthor's revision, have been allowed to remain, because they could not have\r\nbeen taken away without leaving a hiatus, not easy to fill up without\r\ndamage to the author's meaning.\r\n\r\nI give these explanations in obedience to the rules laid down for the\r\nguidance of editors at page 15.[2] If any apology for the fragmentary\r\ncharacter of the book be thought necessary, it may be found in the author's\r\nown words at page 281 of the second volume.[3]\r\n\r\nThe publication of the Budget could not have been delayed without lessening\r\nthe interest attaching to the writer's thoughts upon questions of our own\r\nday. I trust that, incomplete as the work is compared with what it might\r\nhave been, I shall not be held mistaken in giving it to the world. Rather\r\nlet me hope that it will be welcomed as an old friend returning under great\r\ndisadvantages, but bringing a pleasant remembrance of the amusement which\r\nits weekly appearance in the _Athenaeum_ gave to both writer and reader.\r\n\r\nThe Paradoxes are dealt with in chronological order. This will be a guide\r\nto the reader, and with the alphabetical Index of Names, etc., will, I\r\ntrust, obviate all difficulty of reference.\r\n\r\nSOPHIA DE MORGAN.\r\n\r\n    6 MERTON ROAD, PRIMROSE HILL.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.\r\n\r\nIf Mrs. De Morgan felt called upon to confess her hesitation at taking upon\r\nherself the labor of editing these Paradoxes, much more should one who was\r\nborn two generations later, who lives in another land and who was reared\r\namid different influences, confess to the same feeling when undertaking to\r\nrevise this curious medley. But when we consider the nature of the work,\r\nthe fact that its present rarity deprives so many readers of the enjoyment\r\nof its delicious satire, and the further fact that allusions that were\r\ncommonplace a half century ago are now forgotten, it is evident that some\r\none should take up the work and perform it _con amore_.\r\n\r\nHaving long been an admirer of De Morgan, having continued his work in the\r\nbibliography of early arithmetics, and having worked in his library among\r\nthe books of which he was so fond, it is possible that the present editor,\r\nwhatever may be his other shortcomings, may undertake the labor with as\r\nmuch of sympathy as any one who is in a position to perform it. With this\r\nthought in mind, two definite rules were laid down at the beginning of the\r\ntask: (1) That no alteration in the text should be made, save in slightly\r\nmodernizing spelling and punctuation and in the case of manifest\r\ntypographical errors; (2) That whenever a note appeared it should show at\r\nonce its authorship, to the end that the material of the original edition\r\nmight appear intact.\r\n\r\nIn considering, however, the unbroken sequence of items that form the\r\nBudget, it seems clear that readers would be greatly aided if the various\r\nleading topics were separated in some convenient manner. After considerable\r\nthought it was decided to insert brief captions from time to time that\r\nmight aid the eye in selecting the larger subjects of the text. In some\r\nparts of the work these could easily be taken from the original folio\r\nheads, but usually they had to be written anew. While, therefore, the\r\npresent editor accepts the responsibility for the captions of the various\r\nsubdivisions, he has endeavored to insert them in harmony with the original\r\ntext.\r\n\r\nAs to the footnotes, the first edition had only a few, some due to De\r\nMorgan himself and others to Mrs. De Morgan. In the present edition those\r\ndue to the former are signed A. De M., and those due to Mrs. De Morgan\r\nappear with her initials, S. E. De M. For all other footnotes the present\r\neditor is responsible. In preparing them the effort has been made to\r\nelucidate the text by supplying such information as the casual reader might\r\nwish as he passes over the pages. Hundreds of names are referred to in the\r\ntext that were more or less known in England half a century ago, but are\r\nnow forgotten there and were never familiar elsewhere. Many books that were\r\nthen current have now passed out of memory, and much that agitated England\r\nin De Morgan's prime seems now like ancient history. Even with respect to\r\nwell-known names, a little information as to dates and publications will\r\noften be welcome, although the editor recognizes that it will quite as\r\noften be superfluous. In order, therefore, to derive the pleasure that\r\nshould come from reading the Budget, the reader should have easy access to\r\nthe information that the notes are intended to supply. That they furnish\r\ntoo much here and too little there is to be expected. They are a human\r\nproduct, and if they fail to serve their purpose in all respects it is\r\nhoped that this failure will not seriously interfere with the reader's\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nIn general the present editor has refrained from expressing any opinions\r\nthat would strike a discordant note in the reading of the text as De Morgan\r\nleft it. The temptation is great to add to the discussion at various\r\npoints, but it is a temptation to be resisted. To furnish such information\r\nas shall make the reading more pleasant, rather than to attempt to improve\r\nupon one of the most delicious bits of satire of the nineteenth century,\r\nhas been the editor's wish. It would have been an agreeable task to review\r\nthe history of circle squaring, of the trisection problem, and of the\r\nduplication of the cube. This, however, would be to go too far afield. For\r\nthe benefit of those who wish to investigate the subject the editor can\r\nonly refer to such works and articles as the following: F. Rudio,\r\n_Archimedes, Huygens, Lambert, Legendre,--mit einer Uebersicht ueber die\r\nGeschichte des Problemes von der Quadratur des Zirkels_, Leipsic, 1892;\r\nThomas Muir, \"Circle,\" in the eleventh edition of the _Encyclopaedia\r\nBritannica_; the various histories of mathematics; and to his own article\r\non \"The Incommensurability of [pi]\" in Prof. J. W. A. Young's _Monographs\r\non Topics of Modern Mathematics_, New York, 1911.\r\n\r\nThe editor wishes to express his appreciation and thanks to Dr. Paul Carus,\r\neditor of _The Monist_ and _The Open Court_ for the opportunity of\r\nundertaking this work; to James Earl Russell, LL.D., Dean of Teachers\r\nCollege, Columbia University, for his encouragement in its prosecution; to\r\nMiss Caroline Eustis Seely for her intelligent and painstaking assistance\r\nin securing material for the notes; and to Miss Lydia G. Robinson and Miss\r\nAnna A. Kugler for their aid and helpful suggestions in connection with the\r\nproof-sheets. Without the generous help of all five this work would have\r\nbeen impossible.\r\n\r\nDAVID EUGENE SMITH.\r\n\r\n    TEACHERS COLLEGE, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nA BUDGET OF PARADOXES\r\n\r\n{1}\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\nIf I had before me a fly and an elephant, having never seen more than one\r\nsuch magnitude of either kind; and if the fly were to endeavor to persuade\r\nme that he was larger than the elephant, I might by possibility be placed\r\nin a difficulty. The apparently little creature might use such arguments\r\nabout the effect of distance, and might appeal to such laws of sight and\r\nhearing as I, if unlearned in those things, might be unable wholly to\r\nreject. But if there were a thousand flies, all buzzing, to appearance,\r\nabout the great creature; and, to a fly, declaring, each one for himself,\r\nthat he was bigger than the quadruped; and all giving different and\r\nfrequently contradictory reasons; and each one despising and opposing the\r\nreasons of the others--I should feel quite at my ease. I should certainly\r\nsay, My little friends, the case of each one of you is destroyed by the\r\nrest. I intend to show flies in the swarm, with a few larger animals, for\r\nreasons to be given.\r\n\r\nIn every age of the world there has been an established system, which has\r\nbeen opposed from time to time by isolated and dissentient reformers. The\r\nestablished system has sometimes fallen, slowly and gradually: it has\r\neither been upset by the rising influence of some one man, or it has been\r\nsapped by gradual change of opinion in the many.\r\n\r\nI have insisted on the isolated character of the dissentients, as an\r\nelement of the _a priori_ probabilities of the case. Show me a schism,\r\nespecially a growing schism, and it is another thing. The homeopathists,\r\nfor instance, shall be, if any one so think, as wrong as St. John Long; but\r\nan {2} organized opposition, supported by the efforts of many acting in\r\nconcert, appealing to common arguments and experience, with perpetual\r\nsuccession and a common seal, as the Queen says in the charter, is, be the\r\nmerit of the schism what it may, a thing wholly different from the case of\r\nthe isolated opponent in the mode of opposition to it which reason points\r\nout.\r\n\r\nDuring the last two centuries and a half, physical knowledge has been\r\ngradually made to rest upon a basis which it had not before. It has become\r\n_mathematical_. The question now is, not whether this or that hypothesis is\r\nbetter or worse to the pure thought, but whether it accords with observed\r\nphenomena in those consequences which can be shown necessarily to follow\r\nfrom it, if it be true. Even in those sciences which are not yet under the\r\ndominion of mathematics, and perhaps never will be, a working copy of the\r\nmathematical process has been made. This is not known to the followers of\r\nthose sciences who are not themselves mathematicians and who very often\r\nexalt their horns against the mathematics in consequence. They might as\r\nwell be squaring the circle, for any sense they show in this particular.\r\n\r\nA great many individuals, ever since the rise of the mathematical method,\r\nhave, each for himself, attacked its direct and indirect consequences. I\r\nshall not here stop to point out how the very accuracy of exact science\r\ngives better aim than the preceding state of things could give. I shall\r\ncall each of these persons a _paradoxer_, and his system a _paradox_. I use\r\nthe word in the old sense: a paradox is something which is apart from\r\ngeneral opinion, either in subject-matter, method, or conclusion.\r\n\r\nMany of the things brought forward would now be called _crotchets_, which\r\nis the nearest word we have to old _paradox_. But there is this difference,\r\nthat by calling a thing a _crotchet_ we mean to speak lightly of it; which\r\nwas not the necessary sense of _paradox_. Thus in the sixteenth century\r\nmany spoke of the earth's motion as the _paradox of {3} Copernicus_, who\r\nheld the ingenuity of that theory in very high esteem, and some, I think,\r\nwho even inclined towards it. In the seventeenth century, the depravation\r\nof meaning took place, in England at least. Phillips says _paradox_ is \"a\r\nthing which seemeth strange\"--here is the old meaning: after a colon he\r\nproceeds--\"and absurd, and is contrary to common opinion,\" which is an\r\naddition due to his own time.\r\n\r\nSome of my readers are hardly inclined to think that the word _paradox_\r\ncould once have had no disparagement in its meaning; still less that\r\npersons could have applied it to themselves. I chance to have met with a\r\ncase in point against them. It is Spinoza's _Philosophia Scripturae\r\nInterpres, Exercitatio Paradoxa_, printed anonymously at Eleutheropolis, in\r\n1666. This place was one of several cities in the clouds, to which the\r\ncuckoos resorted who were driven away by the other birds; that is, a\r\nfeigned place of printing, adopted by those who would have caught it if\r\northodoxy could have caught them. Thus, in 1656, the works of Socinus could\r\nonly be printed at Irenopolis. The author deserves his self-imposed title,\r\nas in the following:[4]\r\n\r\n\"Quanto sane satius fuisset illam [Trinitatem] pro mysterio non habuisse,\r\net Philosophiae ope, antequam quod esset statuerent, secundum verae logices\r\npraecepta quid esset cum Cl. Kleckermanno investigasse; tanto fervore ac\r\nlabore in profundissimas speluncas et obscurissimos metaphysicarum\r\nspeculationum atque fictionum recessus se recipere ut ab adversariorum\r\ntelis sententiam suam in tuto collocarent. {4} Profecto magnus ille vir ...\r\ndogma illud, quamvis apud theologos eo nomine non multum gratiae iniverit,\r\nita ex immotis Philosophiae fundamentis explicat ac demonstrat, ut paucis\r\ntantum immutatis, atque additis, nihil amplius animus veritate sincere\r\ndeditus desiderare possit.\"\r\n\r\nThis is properly paradox, though also heterodox. It supposes, contrary to\r\nall opinion, orthodox and heterodox, that philosophy can, with slight\r\nchanges, explain the Athanasian doctrine so as to be at least compatible\r\nwith orthodoxy. The author would stand almost alone, if not quite; and this\r\nis what he meant. I have met with the counter-paradox. I have heard it\r\nmaintained that the doctrine as it stands, in all its mystery is _a priori_\r\nmore likely than any other to have been Revelation, if such a thing were to\r\nbe; and that it might almost have been predicted.\r\n\r\nAfter looking into books of paradoxes for more than thirty years, and\r\nholding conversation with many persons who have written them, and many who\r\nmight have done so, there is one point on which my mind is fully made up.\r\nThe manner in which a paradoxer will show himself, as to sense or nonsense,\r\nwill not depend upon what he maintains, but upon whether he has or has not\r\nmade a sufficient knowledge of what has been done by others, _especially as\r\nto the mode of doing it_, a preliminary to inventing knowledge for himself.\r\nThat a little knowledge is a dangerous thing is one of the most fallacious\r\nof proverbs. A person of small knowledge is in danger of trying to make his\r\n_little_ do the work of _more_; but a person without any is in more danger\r\nof making his _no_ knowledge do the work of _some_. Take the speculations\r\non the tides as an instance. Persons with nothing but a little geometry\r\nhave certainly exposed themselves in their modes of objecting to results\r\nwhich require the higher mathematics to be known before an independent\r\nopinion can be formed on sufficient grounds. But persons with no geometry\r\nat all have done the same thing much more completely. {5}\r\n\r\nThere is a line to be drawn which is constantly put aside in the arguments\r\nheld by paradoxers in favor of their right to instruct the world. Most\r\npersons must, or at least will, like the lady in Cadogan Place,[5] form and\r\nexpress an immense variety of opinions on an immense variety of subjects;\r\nand all persons must be their own guides in many things. So far all is\r\nwell. But there are many who, in carrying the expression of their own\r\nopinions beyond the usual tone of private conversation, whether they go no\r\nfurther than attempts at oral proselytism, or whether they commit\r\nthemselves to the press, do not reflect that they have ceased to stand upon\r\nthe ground on which their process is defensible. Aspiring to lead _others_,\r\nthey have never given themselves the fair chance of being first led by\r\n_other_ others into something better than they can start for themselves;\r\nand that they should first do this is what both those classes of others\r\nhave a fair right to expect. New knowledge, when to any purpose, must come\r\nby contemplation of old knowledge in every matter which concerns thought;\r\nmechanical contrivance sometimes, not very often, escapes this rule. All\r\nthe men who are now called discoverers, in every matter ruled by thought,\r\nhave been men versed in the minds of their predecessors, and learned in\r\nwhat had been before them. There is not one exception. I do not say that\r\nevery man has made direct acquaintance with the whole of his mental\r\nancestry; many have, as I may say, only known their grandfathers by the\r\nreport of their fathers. But even on this point it is remarkable how many\r\nof the greatest names in all departments of knowledge have been real\r\nantiquaries in their several subjects.\r\n\r\nI may cite, among those who have wrought strongly upon opinion or practice\r\nin science, Aristotle, Plato, Ptolemy, Euclid, Archimedes, Roger Bacon,\r\nCopernicus, Francis Bacon, Ramus, Tycho Brahe, Galileo, Napier, Descartes,\r\nLeibnitz, Newton, Locke. I take none but names known out of their {6}\r\nfields of work; and all were learned as well as sagacious. I have chosen my\r\ninstances: if any one will undertake to show a person of little or no\r\nknowledge who has established himself in a great matter of pure thought,\r\nlet him bring forward his man, and we shall see.\r\n\r\nThis is the true way of putting off those who plague others with their\r\ngreat discoveries. The first demand made should be--Mr. Moses, before I\r\nallow you to lead me over the Red Sea, I must have you show that you are\r\nlearned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians upon your own subject. The plea\r\nthat it is unlikely that this or that unknown person should succeed where\r\nNewton, etc. have failed, or should show Newton, etc. to be wrong, is\r\nutterly null and void. It was worthily versified by Sylvanus Morgan (the\r\ngreat herald who in his _Sphere of Gentry_ gave coat armor to \"Gentleman\r\nJesus,\" as he said), who sang of Copernicus as follows (1652):\r\n\r\n \"If Tellus winged be,\r\n  The earth a motion round;\r\n  Then much deceived are they\r\n  Who nere before it found.\r\n  Solomon was the wisest,\r\n  His wit nere this attained;\r\n  Cease, then, Copernicus,\r\n  Thy hypothesis is vain.\"\r\n\r\nNewton, etc. were once unknown; but they made themselves known by what they\r\nknew, and then brought forward what they could do; which I see is as good\r\nverse as that of Herald Sylvanus. The demand for previous knowledge\r\ndisposes of twenty-nine cases out of thirty, and the thirtieth is worth\r\nlistening to.\r\n\r\nI have not set down Copernicus, Galileo, etc. among the paradoxers, merely\r\nbecause everybody knows them; if my list were quite complete, they would\r\nhave been in it. But the reader will find Gilbert, the great precursor of\r\nsound magnetical theory; and several others on whom no censure can be cast,\r\nthough some of their paradoxes are inadmissible, {7} some unprovoked, and\r\nsome capital jokes, true or false: the author of _Vestiges of Creation_ is\r\nan instance. I expect that my old correspondent, General Perronet Thompson,\r\nwill admit that his geometry is part and parcel of my plan; and also that,\r\nif that plan embraced politics, he would claim a place for his _Catechism\r\non the Corn Laws_, a work at one time paradoxical, but which had more to do\r\nwith the abolition of the bread-tax than Sir Robert Peel.\r\n\r\nMy intention in publishing this Budget in the _Athenaeum_ is _to enable\r\nthose who have been puzzled by one or two discoverers to see how they look\r\nin a lump_. The only question is, has the selection been fairly made? To\r\nthis my answer is, that no selection at all has been made. The books are,\r\nwithout exception, those which I have in my own library; and I have taken\r\n_all_--I mean all of the kind: Heaven forbid that I should be supposed to\r\nhave no other books! But I may have been a collector, influenced in choice\r\nby bias? I answer that I never have collected books of this sort--that is,\r\nI have never searched for them, never made up my mind to look out for this\r\nbook or that. I have bought what happened to come in my way at show or\r\nauction; I have retained what came in as part of the _undescribed_ portion\r\nof miscellaneous auction lots; I have received a few from friends who found\r\nthem among what they called their rubbish; and I have preserved books sent\r\nto me for review. In not a few instances the books have been bound up with\r\nothers, unmentioned at the back; and for years I knew no more I had them\r\nthan I knew I had Lord Macclesfield's speech on moving the change of Style,\r\nwhich, after I had searched shops, etc. for it in vain, I found had been\r\nreposing on my own shelves for many years, at the end of a summary of\r\nLeibnitz's philosophy. Consequently, I may positively affirm that the\r\nfollowing list is formed by accident and circumstance alone, and that it\r\ntruly represents the casualties of about a third of a century. For\r\ninstance, the large proportion of works {8} on the quadrature of the circle\r\nis not my doing: it is the natural share of this subject in the actual run\r\nof events.\r\n\r\n[I keep to my plan of inserting only such books as I possessed in 1863,\r\nexcept by casual notice in aid of my remarks. I have found several books on\r\nmy shelves which ought to have been inserted. These have their titles set\r\nout at the commencement of their articles, in leading paragraphs; the\r\ncasuals are without this formality.[6]]\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to open the Budget, I say something on my personal\r\nknowledge of the class of discoverers who square the circle, upset Newton,\r\netc. I suspect I know more of the English class than any man in Britain. I\r\nnever kept any reckoning; but I know that one year with another--and less\r\nof late years than in earlier time--I have talked to more than five in each\r\nyear, giving more than a hundred and fifty specimens. Of this I am sure,\r\nthat it is my own fault if they have not been a thousand. Nobody knows how\r\nthey swarm, except those to whom they naturally resort. They are in all\r\nranks and occupations, of all ages and characters. They are very earnest\r\npeople, and their purpose is _bona fide_ the dissemination of their\r\nparadoxes. A great many--the mass, indeed--are illiterate, and a great many\r\nwaste their means, and are in or approaching penury. But I must say that\r\nnever, in any one instance, has the quadrature of the circle, or the like,\r\nbeen made a pretext for begging; even to be asked to purchase a book is of\r\nthe very rarest occurrence--it has happened, and that is all.\r\n\r\nThese discoverers despise one another: if there were the concert among them\r\nwhich there is among foreign mendicants, a man who admitted one to a\r\nconference would be plagued to death. I once gave something to a very\r\ngenteel French applicant, who overtook me in the street, at my own door,\r\nsaying he had picked up my handkerchief: whether he picked it up in my\r\npocket for an introduction, I know not. {9} But that day week came another\r\nFrenchman to my house, and that day fortnight a French lady; both failed,\r\nand I had no more trouble. The same thing happened with Poles. It is not so\r\nwith circle-squarers, etc.: they know nothing of each other. Some will read\r\nthis list, and will say I am right enough, generally speaking, but that\r\nthere _is_ an exception, if I could but see it.\r\n\r\nI do not mean, by my confession of the manner in which I have sinned\r\nagainst the twenty-four hours, to hold myself out as accessible to personal\r\nexplanation of new plans. Quite the contrary: I consider myself as having\r\nmade my report, and being discharged from further attendance on the\r\nsubject. I will not, from henceforward, talk to any squarer of the circle,\r\ntrisector of the angle, duplicator of the cube, constructor of perpetual\r\nmotion, subverter of gravitation, stagnator of the earth, builder of the\r\nuniverse, etc. I will receive any writings or books which require no\r\nanswer, and read them when I please: I will certainly preserve them--this\r\nlist may be enlarged at some future time.\r\n\r\nThere are three subjects which I have hardly anything upon; astrology,\r\nmechanism, and the infallible way of winning at play. I have never cared to\r\npreserve astrology. The mechanists make models, and not books. The\r\ninfallible winners--though I have seen a few--think their secret too\r\nvaluable, and prefer _mutare quadrata rotundis_--to turn dice into coin--at\r\nthe gaming-house: verily they have their reward.\r\n\r\nI shall now select, to the mystic number seven, instances of my personal\r\nknowledge of those who think they have discovered, in illustration of as\r\nmany misconceptions.\r\n\r\n1. _Attempt by help of the old philosophy, the discoverer not being in\r\npossession of modern knowledge._ A poor schoolmaster, in rags, introduced\r\nhimself to a scientific friend with whom I was talking, and announced that\r\nhe had found out the composition of the sun. \"How was that done?\"--\"By\r\nconsideration of the four elements.\"--\"What are {10} they?\"--\"Of course,\r\nfire, air, earth, and water.\"--\"Did you not know that air, earth, and\r\nwater, have long been known to be no elements at all, but\r\ncompounds?\"--\"What do you mean, sir? Who ever heard of such a thing?\"\r\n\r\n2. _The notion that difficulties are enigmas, to be overcome in a moment by\r\na lucky thought._ A nobleman of very high rank, now long dead, read an\r\narticle by me on the quadrature, in an early number of the _Penny\r\nMagazine_. He had, I suppose, school recollections of geometry. He put\r\npencil to paper, drew a circle, and constructed what seemed likely to\r\nanswer, and, indeed, was--as he said--certain, if only this bit were equal\r\nto that; which of course it was not. He forwarded his diagram to the\r\nSecretary of the Diffusion Society, to be handed to the author of the\r\narticle, in case the difficulty should happen to be therein overcome.\r\n\r\n3. _Discovery at all hazards, to get on in the world._ Thirty years ago, an\r\nofficer of rank, just come from foreign service, and trying for a\r\ndecoration from the Crown, found that his claims were of doubtful amount,\r\nand was told by a friend that so and so, who had got the order, had the\r\nadditional claim of scientific distinction. Now this officer, while abroad,\r\nhad bethought himself one day, that there really could be no difficulty in\r\nfinding the circumference of a circle: if a circle were rolled upon a\r\nstraight line until the undermost point came undermost again, there would\r\nbe the straight line equal to the circle. He came to me, saying that he did\r\nnot feel equal to the statement of his claim in this respect, but that if\r\nsome clever fellow would put the thing in a proper light, he thought his\r\naffair might be managed. I was clever enough to put the thing in a proper\r\nlight to himself, to this extent at least, that, though perhaps they were\r\nwrong, the advisers of the Crown would never put the letters K.C.B. to such\r\na circle as his.\r\n\r\n4. _The notion that mathematicians cannot find the circle for common\r\npurposes._ A working man measured the altitude of a cylinder accurately,\r\nand--I think the process of {11} Archimedes was one of his\r\nproceedings--found its bulk. He then calculated the ratio of the\r\ncircumference to the diameter, and found it answered very well on other\r\nmodes of trial. His result was about 3.14. He came to London, and somebody\r\nsent him to me. Like many others of his pursuit, he seemed to have turned\r\nthe whole force of his mind upon one of his points, on which alone he would\r\nbe open to refutation. He had read some of Kater's experiments, and had got\r\nthe Act of 1825 on weights and measures. Say what I would, he had for a\r\nlong time but one answer--\"Sir! I go upon Captain Kater and the Act of\r\nParliament.\" But I fixed him at last. I happened to have on the table a\r\nproof-sheet of the _Astronomical Memoirs_, in which were a large number of\r\nobserved places of the planets compared with prediction, and asked him\r\nwhether it could be possible that persons who did not know the circle\r\nbetter than he had found it could make the calculations, of which I gave\r\nhim a notion, so accurately? He was perfectly astonished, and took the\r\ntitles of some books which he said he would read.\r\n\r\n5. _Application for the reward from abroad._ Many years ago, about\r\ntwenty-eight, I think, a Jesuit came from South America, with a quadrature,\r\nand a cutting from a newspaper announcing that a reward was ready for the\r\ndiscovery in England. On this evidence he came over. After satisfying him\r\nthat nothing had ever been offered here, I discussed his quadrature, which\r\nwas of no use. I succeeded better when I told him of Richard White, also a\r\nJesuit, and author of a quadrature published before 1648, under the name of\r\n_Chrysaespis_, of which I can give no account, having never seen it. This\r\nWhite (_Albius_) is the only quadrator who was ever convinced of his error.\r\nMy Jesuit was struck by the instance, and promised to read more\r\ngeometry--he was no Clavius--before he published his book. He relapsed,\r\nhowever, for I saw his book advertised in a few days. I may say, as\r\nsufficient proof of my being no collector, that I had not the curiosity to\r\nbuy his book; and my friend the {12} Jesuit did not send me a copy, which\r\nhe ought to have done, after the hour I had given him.\r\n\r\n6. _Application for the reward at home._ An agricultural laborer squared\r\nthe circle, and brought the proceeds to London. He left his papers with me,\r\none of which was the copy of a letter to the Lord Chancellor, desiring his\r\nLordship to hand over forthwith 100,000 pounds, the amount of the alleged\r\noffer of reward. He did not go quite so far as M. de Vausenville, who, I\r\nthink in 1778, brought an action against the Academy of Sciences to recover\r\na reward to which he held himself entitled. I returned the papers, with a\r\nnote, stating that he had not the knowledge requisite to see in what the\r\nproblem consisted. I got for answer a letter in which I was told that a\r\nperson who could not see that he had done the thing should \"change his\r\nbusiness, and appropriate his time and attention to a Sunday-school, to\r\nlearn what he could, and keep the _litle_ children from _durting_ their\r\n_close_.\" I also received a letter from a friend of the quadrator,\r\ninforming me that I knew his friend had succeeded, and had been heard to\r\nsay so. These letters were printed--without the names of the writers--for\r\nthe amusement of the readers of _Notes and Queries_, First Series, xii. 57,\r\nand they will appear again in the sequel.\r\n\r\n[There are many who have such a deep respect for any attempt at thought\r\nthat they are shocked at ridicule even of those who have made themselves\r\nconspicuous by pretending to lead the world in matters which they have not\r\nstudied. Among my anonyms is a gentleman who is angry at my treatment of\r\nthe \"poor but thoughtful\" man who is described in my introduction as\r\nrecommending me to go to a Sunday-school because I informed him that he did\r\nnot know in what the difficulty of quadrature consisted. My impugner quite\r\nforgets that this man's \"thoughtfulness\" chiefly consisted in his demanding\r\na hundred thousand pounds from the Lord Chancellor for his discovery; and I\r\nmay add, that his greatest stretch of invention was finding out that \"the\r\nclergy\" {13} were the means of his modest request being unnoticed. I\r\nmention this letter because it affords occasion to note a very common\r\nerror, namely, that men unread in their subjects have, by natural wisdom,\r\nbeen great benefactors of mankind. My critic says, \"Shakspeare, whom the\r\nPro^r (_sic_) may admit to be a wisish man, though an object of contempt as\r\nto learning ...\" Shakespeare an object of contempt as to learning! Though\r\nnot myself a thoroughgoing Shakespearean--and adopting the first half of\r\nthe opinion given by George III, \"What! is there not sad stuff? only one\r\nmust not say so\"--I am strongly of opinion that he throws out the masonic\r\nsigns of learning in almost every scene, to all who know what they are. And\r\nthis over and above every kind of direct evidence. First, foremost, and\r\nenough, the evidence of Ben Jonson that he had \"little Latin and less\r\nGreek\"; then Shakespeare had as much Greek as Jonson would call _some_,\r\neven when he was depreciating. To have any Greek at all was in those days\r\nexceptional. In Shakespeare's youth St. Paul's and Merchant Taylor's\r\nschools were to have masters learned in good and clean Latin literature,\r\n_and also in Greek if such may be gotten_. When Jonson spoke as above, he\r\nintended to put Shakespeare low among the learned, but not out of their\r\npale; and he spoke as a rival dramatist, who was proud of his own learned\r\nsock; and it may be a subject of inquiry how much Latin _he_ would call\r\n_little_. If Shakespeare's learning on certain points be very much less\r\nvisible than Jonson's, it is partly because Shakespeare's writings hold it\r\nin chemical combination, Jonson's in mechanical aggregation.]\r\n\r\n7. An elderly man came to me to show me how the universe was created. There\r\nwas one molecule, which by vibration became--Heaven knows how!--the Sun.\r\nFurther vibration produced Mercury, and so on. I suspect the nebular\r\nhypothesis had got into the poor man's head by reading, in some singular\r\nmixture with what it found there. Some modifications of vibration gave\r\nheat, electricity, etc. I {14} listened until my informant ceased to\r\nvibrate--which is always the shortest way--and then said, \"Our knowledge of\r\nelastic fluids is imperfect.\" \"Sir!\" said he, \"I see you perceive the truth\r\nof what I have said, and I will reward your attention by telling you what I\r\nseldom disclose, never, except to those who can receive my theory--the\r\nlittle molecule whose vibrations have given rise to our solar system is the\r\nLogos of St. John's Gospel!\" He went away to Dr. Lardner, who would not go\r\ninto the solar system at all--the first molecule settled the question. So\r\nhard upon poor discoverers are men of science who are not antiquaries in\r\ntheir subject! On leaving, he said, \"Sir, Mr. De Morgan received me in a\r\nvery different way! he heard me attentively, and I left him perfectly\r\nsatisfied of the truth of my system.\" I have had much reason to think that\r\nmany discoverers, of all classes, believe they have convinced every one who\r\nis not peremptory to the verge of incivility.\r\n\r\nMy list is given in chronological order. My readers will understand that my\r\ngeneral expressions, where slighting or contemptuous, refer to the\r\nignorant, who teach before they have learned. In every instance, those of\r\nwhom I am able to speak with respect, whether as right or wrong, have\r\nsought knowledge in the subject they were to handle before they completed\r\ntheir speculations. I shall further illustrate this at the conclusion of my\r\nlist.\r\n\r\nBefore I begin the list, I give prominence to the following letter,\r\naddressed by me to the _Correspondent_ of October 28, 1865. Some of my\r\nparadoxers attribute to me articles in this or that journal; and others may\r\nthink--I know some do think--they know me as the writer of reviews of some\r\nof the very books noticed here. The following remarks will explain the way\r\nin which they may be right, and in which they may be wrong. {15}\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE EDITORIAL SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,--I have reason to think that many persons have a very inaccurate\r\nnotion of the _Editorial System_. What I call by this name has grown up in\r\nthe last _centenary_--a word I may use to signify the hundred years now\r\nending, and to avoid the ambiguity of _century_. It cannot conveniently be\r\nexplained by editors themselves, and _edited_ journals generally do not\r\nlike to say much about it. In _your_ paper perhaps, in which editorial\r\nduties differ somewhat from those of ordinary journals, the common system\r\nmay be freely spoken of.\r\n\r\n\"When a reviewed author, as very often happens, writes to the editor of the\r\nreviewing journal to complain of what has been said of him, he\r\nfrequently--even more often than not--complains of 'your reviewer.' He\r\nsometimes presumes that 'you' have, 'through inadvertence' in this\r\ninstance, 'allowed some incompetent person to lower the character of your\r\nusually accurate pages.' Sometimes he talks of 'your scribe,' and, in\r\nextreme cases, even of 'your hack.' All this shows perfect ignorance of the\r\njournal system, except where it is done under the notion of letting the\r\neditor down easy. But the editor never accepts the mercy.\r\n\r\n\"All that is in a journal, except what is marked as from a correspondent,\r\neither by the editor himself or by the correspondent's real or fictitious\r\nsignature, is published entirely on editorial responsibility, as much as if\r\nthe editor had written it himself. The editor, therefore, may claim, and\r\ndoes claim and exercise, unlimited right of omission, addition, and\r\nalteration. This is so well understood that the editor performs his last\r\nfunction on the last revise without the 'contributor' knowing what is done.\r\nThe word _contributor_ is the proper one; it implies that he furnishes\r\nmaterials without stating what he furnishes or how much of it is accepted,\r\nor whether he be the only contributor. All this applies both to political\r\nand literary journals. No editor acknowledges {16} the right of a\r\ncontributor to withdraw an article, if he should find alterations in the\r\nproof sent to him for correction which would make him wish that the article\r\nshould not appear. If the _demand_ for suppression were made--I say nothing\r\nabout what might be granted to _request_--the answer would be, 'It is not\r\nyour article, but mine; I have all the responsibility; if it should contain\r\na libel, I could not give you up, even at your own desire. You have\r\nfurnished me with materials, on the known and common understanding that I\r\nwas to use them at my discretion, and you have no right to impede my\r\noperations by making the appearance of the article depend on your\r\napprobation of my use of your materials.'\r\n\r\n\"There is something to be said for this system, and something against it--I\r\nmean simply on its own merits. But the all-conquering argument in its favor\r\nis, that the only practicable alternative is the modern French plan of no\r\narticles without the signature of the writers. I need not discuss this\r\nplan; there is no collective party in favor of it. Some may think it is not\r\nthe only alternative; they have not produced any intermediate proposal in\r\nwhich any dozen of persons have concurred. Many will say, Is not all this,\r\nthough perfectly correct, well known to be matter of form? Is it not\r\npractically the course of events that an engaged contributor writes the\r\narticle, and sends it to the editor, who admits it as\r\nwritten--substantially, at least? And is it not often very well known, by\r\nstyle and in other ways, who it was wrote the article? This system is\r\nmatter of form just as much as loaded pistols are matter of form so long as\r\nthe wearer is not assailed; but matter of form takes the form of matter in\r\nthe pulling of a trigger, so soon as the need arises. Editors and\r\ncontributors who can work together find each other out by elective\r\naffinity, so that the common run of events settles down into most articles\r\nappearing much as they are written. And there are two safety-valves; that\r\nis, when judicious persons come together. In the first place, the editor\r\nhimself, when he has selected his contributor, feels that {17} the\r\ncontributor is likely to know his business better than an editor can teach\r\nhim; in fact, it is on that principle that the selection is made. But he\r\nfeels that he is more competent than the writer to judge questions of\r\nstrength and of tone, especially when the general purpose of the journal is\r\nconsidered, of which the editor is the judge without appeal. An editor who\r\nmeddles with substantive matter is likely to be wrong, even when he knows\r\nthe subject; but one who prunes what he deems excess, is likely to be\r\nright, even when he does not know the subject. In the second place, a\r\ncontributor knows that he is supplying an editor, and learns, without\r\nsuppressing truth or suggesting falsehood, to make the tone of his\r\ncommunications suit the periodical in which they are to appear. Hence it\r\nvery often arises that a reviewed author, who thinks he knows the name of\r\nhis reviewer, and proclaims it with expressions of dissatisfaction, is only\r\nwrong in supposing that his critic has given all his mind. It has happened\r\nto myself more than once, to be announced as the author of articles which I\r\ncould not have signed, because they did not go far enough to warrant my\r\naffixing my name to them as to a sufficient expression of my own opinion.\r\n\r\n\"There are two other ways in which a reviewed author may be wrong about his\r\ncritic. An editor frequently makes slight insertions or omissions--I mean\r\nslight in quantity of type--as he goes over the last proof; this he does in\r\na comparative hurry, and it may chance that he does not know the full sting\r\nof his little alteration. The very bit which the writer of the book most\r\ncomplains of may not have been seen by the person who is called the writer\r\nof the article until after the appearance of the journal; nay, if he be one\r\nof those--few, I daresay--who do not read their own articles, may never\r\nhave been seen by him at all. Possibly, the insertion or omission would not\r\nhave been made if the editor could have had one minute's conversation with\r\nhis contributor. Sometimes it actually contradicts something which is {18}\r\nallowed to remain in another part of the article; and sometimes, especially\r\nin the case of omission, it renders other parts of the article\r\nunintelligible. These are disadvantages of the system, and a judicious\r\neditor is not very free with his _unus et alter pannus_. Next, readers in\r\ngeneral, when they see the pages of a journal with the articles so nicely\r\nfitting, and so many ending with the page or column, have very little\r\nnotion of the cutting and carving which goes to the process. At the very\r\nlast moment arises the necessity of some trimming of this kind; and the\r\neditor, who would gladly call the writer to counsel if he could, is obliged\r\nto strike out ten or twelve lines. He must do his best, but it may chance\r\nthat the omission selected would take from the writer the power of owning\r\nthe article. A few years ago, an able opponent of mine wrote to a journal\r\nsome criticisms upon an article which he expressly attributed to me. I\r\nreplied as if I were the writer, which, in a sense, I was. But if any one\r\nhad required of me an unmodified 'Yes' or 'No' to the question whether I\r\nwrote the article, I must, of two falsehoods, have chosen 'No': for certain\r\nomissions, dictated by the necessities of space and time, would have\r\namounted, had my signature been affixed, to a silent surrender of points\r\nwhich, in my own character, I must have strongly insisted on, unless I had\r\nchosen to admit certain inferences against what I had previously published\r\nin my own name. I may here add that the forms of journalism obliged me in\r\nthis case to remind my opponent that it could not be permitted to me, _in\r\nthat journal_, either to acknowledge or deny the authorship of the\r\narticles. The cautions derived from the above remarks are particularly\r\nwanted with reference to the editorial comments upon letters of complaint.\r\nThere is often no time to send these letters to the contributor, and even\r\nwhen this can be done, an editor is--and very properly--never of so\r\neditorial a mind as when he is revising the comments of a contributor upon\r\nan assailant of the article. He is then in a better position as to\r\ninformation, and a more {19} critical position as to responsibility. Of\r\ncourse, an editor never meddles, except under notice, with the letter of a\r\ncorrespondent, whether of a complainant, of a casual informant, or of a\r\ncontributor who sees reason to become a correspondent. Omissions must\r\nsometimes be made when a grievance is too highly spiced. It did once happen\r\nto me that a waggish editor made an insertion without notice in a letter\r\nsigned by me with some fiction, which insertion contained the name of a\r\nfriend of mine, with a satire which I did not believe, and should not have\r\nwritten if I had. To my strong rebuke, he replied--'I know it was very\r\nwrong; but human nature could not resist.' But this was the only occasion\r\non which such a thing ever happened to me.\r\n\r\n\"I daresay what I have written may give some of your readers to understand\r\nsome of the _pericula et commoda_ of modern journalism. I have known men of\r\ndeep learning and science as ignorant of the prevailing system as any\r\nuneducated reader of a newspaper in a country town. I may perhaps induce\r\nsome writers not to be too sure about this, that, or the other person. They\r\nmay detect their reviewer, and they may be safe in attributing to him the\r\ngeneral matter and tone of the article. But about one and another point,\r\nespecially if it be a short and stinging point, they may very easily chance\r\nto be wrong. It has happened to myself, and within a few weeks to\r\npublication, to be wrong in two ways in reading a past article--to\r\nattribute to editorial insertion what was really my own, and to attribute\r\nto myself what was really editorial insertion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a man to do who is asked whether he wrote an article? He may, of\r\ncourse, refuse to answer; which is regarded as an admission. He may say, as\r\nSwift did to Serjeant Bettesworth, \"Sir, when I was a young man, a friend\r\nof mine advised me, whenever I was asked whether I had written a certain\r\npaper, to deny it; and I accordingly tell that I did _not_ write it.\" He\r\nmay say, as I often do, {20} when charged with having invented a joke,\r\nstory, or epigram, \"I want all the credit I can get, and therefore I always\r\nacknowledge all that is attributed to me, truly or not; the story, etc.\r\n_is_ mine.\" But for serious earnest, in the matter of imputed criticism,\r\nthe answer may be, \"The article was of my material, but the editor has not\r\nlet it stand as I gave it; I cannot own it as a whole.\" He may then refuse\r\nto be particular as to the amount of the editor's interference. Of this\r\nthere are two extreme cases. The editor may have expunged nothing but a\r\nqualifying adverb. Or he may have done as follows. We all remember the\r\naccount of Adam which satirizes woman, but eulogizes her if every second\r\nand third line be transposed. As in:\r\n\r\n \"Adam could find no solid peace\r\n    When Eve was given him for a mate,\r\n  Till he beheld a woman's face,\r\n    Adam was in a happy state.\"\r\n\r\nIf this had been the article, and a gallant editor had made the\r\ntranspositions, the author could not with truth acknowledge. If the\r\nalteration were only an omitted adverb, or a few things of the sort, the\r\nauthor could not with truth deny. In all that comes between, every man must\r\nbe his own casuist. I stared, when I was a boy, to hear grave persons\r\napprove of Sir Walter Scott's downright denial that he was the author of\r\nWaverley, in answer to the Prince Regent's downright question. If I\r\nremember rightly, Samuel Johnson would have approved of the same course.\r\n\r\nIt is known that, whatever the law gives, it also gives all that is\r\nnecessary to full possession; thus a man whose land is environed by land of\r\nothers has a right of way over the land of these others. By analogy, it is\r\nargued that when a man has a right to his secret, he has a right to all\r\nthat is necessary to keep it, and that is not unlawful. If, then, he can\r\nonly keep his secret by denial, he has a right to denial. This I admit to\r\nbe an answer against all men except the denier himself; if conscience and\r\nself-respect will allow {21} it, no one can impeach it. But the question\r\ncannot be solved on a case. That question is, A lie, is it _malum in se_,\r\nwithout reference to meaning and circumstances? This is a question with two\r\nsides to it. Cases may be invented in which a lie is the only way of\r\npreventing a murder, or in which a lie may otherwise save a life. In these\r\ncases it is difficult to acquit, and almost impossible to blame; discretion\r\nintroduced, the line becomes very hard to draw.\r\n\r\nI know but one work which has precisely--as at first appears--the character\r\nand object of my Budget. It is the _Review of the Works of the Royal\r\nSociety of London_, by Sir John Hill, M.D. (1751 and 1780, 4to.). This man\r\noffended many: the Royal Society, by his work, the medical profession, by\r\ninventing and selling extra-pharmacopoeian doses; Garrick, by resenting the\r\nrejection of a play. So Garrick wrote:\r\n\r\n \"For physic and farces his equal there scarce is;\r\n  His farces are physic; his physic a farce is.\"\r\n\r\nI have fired at the Royal Society and at the medical profession, but I have\r\ngiven a wide berth to the drama and its wits; so there is no epigram out\r\nagainst me, as yet. He was very able and very eccentric. Dr. Thomson\r\n(_Hist. Roy. Soc._) says he has no humor, but Dr. Thomson was a man who\r\nnever would have discovered humor.\r\n\r\nMr. Weld (_Hist. Roy. Soc._) backs Dr. Thomson, but with a remarkable\r\naddition. Having followed his predecessor in observing that the\r\n_Transactions_ in Martin Folkes's time have an unusual proportion of\r\ntrifling and puerile papers, he says that Hill's book is a poor attempt at\r\nhumor, and glaringly exhibits the feelings of a disappointed man. It is\r\nprobable, he adds, that the points told with some effect on the Society;\r\nfor shortly after its publication the _Transactions_ possess a much higher\r\nscientific value.\r\n\r\nI copy an account which I gave elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWhen the Royal Society was founded, the Fellows set {22} to work to prove\r\nall things, that they might hold fast that which was good. They bent\r\nthemselves to the question whether sprats were young herrings. They made a\r\ncircle of the powder of a unicorn's horn, and set a spider in the middle of\r\nit; \"but it immediately ran out.\" They tried several times, and the spider\r\n\"once made some stay in the powder.\" They inquired into Kenelm Digby's\r\nsympathetic powder. \"Magnetic cures being discoursed of, Sir Gilbert Talbot\r\npromised to communicate what he knew of sympathetical cures; and those\r\nmembers who had any of the powder of sympathy, were desired to bring some\r\nof it at the next meeting.\"\r\n\r\nJune 21, 1661, certain gentlemen were appointed \"curators of the proposal\r\nof tormenting a man with the sympathetic powder\"; I cannot find any record\r\nof the result. And so they went on until the time of Sir John Hill's\r\nsatire, in 1751. This once well-known work is, in my judgment, the greatest\r\ncompliment the Royal Society ever received. It brought forward a number of\r\nwhat are now feeble and childish researches in the Philosophical\r\nTransactions. It showed that the inquirers had actually been inquiring; and\r\nthat they did not pronounce decision about \"natural _knowledge_\" by help of\r\n\"_natural_ knowledge.\" But for this, Hill would neither have known what to\r\nassail, nor how. Matters are now entirely changed. The scientific bodies\r\nare far too well established to risk themselves. _Ibit qui zonam perdidit:_\r\n\r\n    \"Let him take castles who has ne'er a groat.\"\r\n\r\nThese great institutions are now without any collective purpose, except\r\nthat of promoting individual energy; they print for their contributors, and\r\nguard themselves by a general declaration that they will not be answerable\r\nfor the things they print. Of course they will not put forward anything for\r\neverybody; but a writer of a certain reputation, or matter of a certain\r\nlook of plausibility and safety, {23} will find admission. This is as it\r\nshould be; the pasturer of flocks and herds and the hunters of wild beasts\r\nare two very different bodies, with very different policies. The scientific\r\nacademies are what a spiritualist might call \"publishing mediums,\" and\r\n_their_ spirits fall occasionally into writing which looks as if minds in\r\nthe higher state were not always impervious to nonsense.\r\n\r\nThe following joke is attributed to Sir John Hill. I cannot honestly say I\r\nbelieve it; but it shows that his contemporaries did not believe he had no\r\nhumor. Good stories are always in some sort of keeping with the characters\r\non which they are fastened. Sir John Hill contrived a communication to the\r\nRoyal Society from Portsmouth, to the effect that a sailor had broken his\r\nleg in a fall from the mast-head; that bandages and a plentiful application\r\nof tarwater had made him, in three days, able to use his leg as well as\r\never. While this communication was under grave discussion--it must be\r\nremembered that many then thought tarwater had extraordinary remedial\r\nproperties--the joker contrived that a second letter should be delivered,\r\nwhich stated that the writer had forgotten, in his previous communication,\r\nto mention that the leg was a wooden leg! Horace Walpole told this story, I\r\nsuppose for the first time; he is good authority for the fact of\r\ncirculation, but for nothing more.\r\n\r\nSir John Hill's book is droll and cutting satire. Dr. Maty, (Sec. Royal\r\nSociety) wrote thus of it in the _Journal Britannique_ (Feb. 1751), of\r\nwhich he was editor:\r\n\r\n\"Il est facheux que cet ingenieux Naturaliste, qui nous a deja donne et qui\r\nnous prepare encore des ouvrages plus utiles, emploie a cette odieuse tache\r\nune plume qu'il trempe dans le fiel et dans l'absinthe. Il est vrai que\r\nplusieurs de ses remarques sont fondees, et qu'a l'erreur qu'il indique, il\r\njoint en meme tems la correction. Mais il n'est pas toujours equitable, et\r\nne manque jamais d'insulter. Que peut {24} apres tout prouver son livre, si\r\nce n'est que la quarante-cinquieme partie d'un tres-ample et tres-utile\r\nRecueil n'est pas exempte d'erreurs? Devoit-il confondre avec des Ecrivains\r\nsuperficiels, dont la Liberte du Corps ne permet pas de restreindre la\r\nfertilite, cette foule de savans du Premier ordre, dont les Ecrits ont orne\r\net ornent encore les Transactions? A-t-il oublie qu'on y a vu frequemment\r\nles noms des Boyle, des Newton, des Halley, des De Moivres, des Hans\r\nSloane, etc.? Et qu'on y trouve encore ceux des Ward, des Bradley, des\r\nGraham, des Ellicot, des Watson, et d'un Auteur que Mr. Hill prefere a tous\r\nles autres, je veux dire de Mr. Hill lui-meme?\"[7]\r\n\r\nThis was the only answer; but it was no answer at all. Hill's object was to\r\nexpose the absurdities; he therefore collected the absurdities. I feel sure\r\nthat Hill was a benefactor of the Royal Society; and much more than he\r\nwould have been if he had softened their errors and enhanced their praises.\r\nNo reviewer will object to me that I have omitted Young, Laplace, etc. But\r\nthen my book has a true title. Hill should not have called his a review of\r\nthe \"Works.\"\r\n\r\nIt was charged against Sir John Hill that he had tried to become a Fellow\r\nof the Royal Society and had failed. This he denied, and challenged the\r\nproduction of the certificate which a candidate always sends in, and which\r\nis preserved. {25} But perhaps he could not get so far as a\r\ncertificate--that is, could not find any one to recommend him; he was a\r\nlikely man to be in such a predicament. As I have myself run foul of the\r\nSociety on some little points, I conceive it possible that I may fall under\r\na like suspicion. Whether I could have been a Fellow, I cannot know; as the\r\ngentleman said who was asked if he could play the violin, I never tried. I\r\nhave always had a high opinion of the Society upon its whole history. A\r\nperson used to historical inquiry learns to look at wholes; the\r\nUniversities of Oxford and Cambridge, the College of Physicians, etc. are\r\ntaken in all their duration. But those who are not historians--I mean not\r\npossessed of the habit of history--hold a mass of opinions about current\r\nthings which lead them into all kinds of confusion when they try to look\r\nback. Not to give an instance which will offend any set of existing\r\nmen--this merely because I can do without it--let us take the country at\r\nlarge. Magna Charta for ever! glorious safeguard of our liberties! _Nullus\r\nliber homo capiatur aut imprisonetur ... aut aliquo modo destruatur, nisi\r\nper judicium parium_ ....[8] _Liber homo: frank home_; a capital thing for\r\nhim--but how about the _villeins_? Oh, there are none _now_! But there\r\nwere. Who cares for villains, or barbarians, or helots? And so England, and\r\nAthens, and Sparta, were free States; all the freemen in them were free.\r\nLong after Magna Charta, villains were sold with their \"chattels and\r\noffspring,\" named in that order. Long after Magna Charta, it was law that\r\n\"Le Seigniour poit rob, naufrer, et chastiser son villein a son volunt,\r\nsalve que il ne poit luy maim.\"[9]\r\n\r\nThe Royal Society was founded as a co-operative body, and co-operation was\r\nits purpose. The early charters, etc. do not contain a trace of the\r\nintention to create a _scientific distinction_, a kind of Legion of Honor.\r\nIt is clear that the {26} qualification was ability and willingness to do\r\ngood work for the promotion of natural knowledge, no matter in how many\r\npersons, nor of what position in society. Charles II gave a smart rebuke\r\nfor exclusiveness, as elsewhere mentioned. In time arose, almost of course,\r\nthe idea of distinction attaching to the title; and when I first began to\r\nknow the Society, it was in this state. Gentlemen of good social position\r\nwere freely elected if they were really educated men; but the moment a\r\nclaimant was announced as resting on his science, there was a disposition\r\nto inquire whether he was scientific enough. The maxim of the poet was\r\nadopted; and the Fellows were practically divided into _Drink-deeps_ and\r\n_Taste-nots_.\r\n\r\nI was, in early life, much repelled by the tone taken by the Fellows of the\r\nSociety with respect to their very mixed body. A man high in science--some\r\nthirty-seven years ago (about 1830)--gave me some encouragement, as he\r\nthought. \"We shall have you a Fellow of the Royal Society in time,\" said\r\nhe. Umph! thought I: for I had that day heard of some recent elections, the\r\nunited science of which would not have demonstrated I. 1, nor explained the\r\naction of a pump. Truly an elevation to look up at! It came, further, to my\r\nknowledge that the Royal Society--if I might judge by the claims made by\r\nvery influential Fellows--considered itself as entitled to the best of\r\neverything: second-best being left for the newer bodies. A secretary, in\r\nreturning thanks for the Royal at an anniversary of the Astronomical, gave\r\nrather a lecture to the company on the positive duty of all present to send\r\nthe very best to the old body, and the absolute right of the old body to\r\nexpect it. An old friend of mine, on a similar occasion, stated as a fact\r\nthat the thing was always done, as well as that it ought to be done.\r\n\r\nOf late years this pretension has been made by a President of the Society.\r\nIn 1855, Lord Rosse presented a confidential memorandum to the Council on\r\nthe expediency of enlarging their number. He says, \"In a Council so small\r\nit {27} is impossible to secure a satisfactory representation of the\r\nleading scientific Societies, and it is scarcely to be expected that, under\r\nsuch circumstances, they will continue to publish inferior papers while\r\nthey send the best to our _Transactions_.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, again, with all the Societies represented on the Council, \"even if\r\nevery Science had its Society, and if they published everything,\r\nwithholding their best papers [i.e., from the Royal Society], which they\r\nwould not be likely to do, still there would remain to the Royal Society\r\n....\" Lord Rosse seems to imagine that the minor Societies themselves\r\ntransfer their best papers to the Royal Society; that if, for instance, the\r\nAstronomical Society were to receive from A.B. a paper of unusual merit,\r\nthe Society would transfer it to the Royal Society. This is quite wrong:\r\nany preference of the Royal to another Society is the work of the\r\ncontributor himself. But it shows how well hafted is the Royal Society's\r\nclaim, that a President should acquire the notion that it is acknowledged\r\nand acted upon by the other Societies, in their joint and corporate\r\ncapacities. To the pretension thus made I never could give any sympathy.\r\nWhen I first heard Mr. Christie, Sec. R. S., set it forth at the\r\nanniversary dinner of the Astronomical Society, I remembered the Baron in\r\nWalter Scott:\r\n\r\n \"Of Gilbert the Galliard a heriot he sought,\r\n  Saying, Give thy best steed as a vassal ought.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I remembered the answer:\r\n\r\n \"Lord and Earl though thou be, I trow\r\n  I can rein Buck's-foot better than thou.\"\r\n\r\nFully conceding that the Royal Society is entitled to preeminent rank and\r\nall the respect due to age and services, I could not, nor can I now, see\r\nany more obligation in a contributor to send his best to that Society than\r\nhe can make out to be due to himself. This pretension, in my mind, was\r\nhooked on, by my historical mode of viewing things already mentioned, to my\r\nknowledge of the fact that the Royal {28} Society--the chief fault,\r\nperhaps, lying with its President, Sir Joseph Banks--had sternly set itself\r\nagainst the formation of other societies; the Geological and Astronomical,\r\nfor instance, though it must be added that the chief rebels came out of the\r\nSociety itself. And so a certain not very defined dislike was generated in\r\nmy mind--an anti-aristocratic affair--to the body which seemed to me a\r\nlittle too uplifted. This would, I daresay, have worn off; but a more\r\nformidable objection arose. My views of physical science gradually arranged\r\nthemselves into a form which would have rendered F.R.S., as attached to my\r\nname, a false representation symbol. The Royal Society is the great\r\nfortress of general physics: and in the philosophy of our day, as to\r\ngeneral physics, there is something which makes the banner of the R.S. one\r\nunder which I cannot march. Everybody who saw the three letters after my\r\nname would infer certain things as to my mode of thought which would not be\r\ntrue inference. It would take much space to explain this in full. I may\r\nhereafter, perhaps, write a budget of collected results of the _a priori\r\nphilosophy_, the nibbling at the small end of omniscience, and the effect\r\nit has had on common life, from the family parlor to the jury-box, from the\r\ngirls'-school to the vestry-meeting. There are in the Society those who\r\nwould, were there no others, prevent my criticism, be its conclusions true\r\nor false, from having any basis; but they are in the minority.\r\n\r\nThere is no objection to be made to the principles of philosophy in vogue\r\nat the Society, when they are stated as principles; but there is an\r\nomniscience in daily practice which the principles repudiate. In like\r\nmanner, the most retaliatory Christians have a perfect form of round words\r\nabout behavior to those who injure them; none of them are as candid as a\r\nlittle boy I knew, who, to his mother's admonition, You should love your\r\nenemies, answered--Catch me at it!\r\n\r\nYears ago, a change took place which would alone have {29} put a sufficient\r\ndifficulty in the way. The co-operative body got tired of getting funds\r\nfrom and lending name to persons who had little or no science, and wanted\r\nF.R.S. to be in every case a Fellow Really Scientific. Accordingly, the\r\nnumber of yearly elections was limited to fifteen recommended by the\r\nCouncil, unless the general body should choose to elect more; which it does\r\nnot do. The election is now a competitive examination: it is no longer--Are\r\nyou able and willing to promote natural knowledge; it is--Are you one of\r\nthe upper fifteen of those who make such claim. In the list of\r\ncandidates--a list rapidly growing in number--each year shows from thirty\r\nto forty of those whom Newton and Boyle would have gladly welcomed as\r\nfellow-laborers. And though the rejected of one year may be the accepted of\r\nthe next--or of the next but one, or but two, if self-respect will permit\r\nthe candidate to hang on--yet the time is clearly coming when many of those\r\nwho ought to be welcomed will be excluded for life, or else shelved at\r\nlast, when past work, with a scientific peerage. Coupled with this attempt\r\nto create a kind of order of knighthood is an absurdity so glaring that it\r\nshould always be kept before the general eye. This distinction, this mark\r\nset by science upon successful investigation, is of necessity a\r\nclass-distinction. Rowan Hamilton, one of the greatest names of our day in\r\nmathematical science, never could attach F.R.S. to his name--_he could not\r\nafford it_. There is a condition precedent--Four Red Sovereigns. It is four\r\npounds a year, or--to those who have contributed to the Transactions--forty\r\npounds down. This is as it should be: the Society must be supported. But it\r\nis not as it should be that a kind of title of honor should be forged, that\r\na body should take upon itself to confer distinctions _for science_, when\r\nit is in the background--and kept there when the distinction is\r\ntrumpeted--that the wearer is a man who can spare four pounds a year. I am\r\nwell aware that in England a person who is not gifted either by nature or\r\nart, with this amount of money power, {30} is, with the mass, a very\r\nsecond-rate sort of Newton, whatever he may be in the field of\r\ninvestigation. Even men of science, so called, have this feeling. I know\r\nthat the _scientific advisers_ of the Admiralty, who, years ago, received\r\n100 pounds a year each for his trouble, were sneered at by a wealthy\r\npretender as \"fellows to whom a hundred a year is an object.\" Dr. Thomas\r\nYoung was one of them. To a bookish man--I mean a man who can manage to\r\ncollect books--there is no tax. To myself, for example, 40 pounds worth of\r\nbooks deducted from my shelves, and the life-use of the Society's splendid\r\nlibrary instead, would have been a capital exchange. But there may be, and\r\nare, men who want books, and cannot pay the Society's price. The Council\r\nwould be very liberal in allowing books to be consulted. I have no doubt\r\nthat if a known investigator were to call and ask to look at certain books,\r\nthe Assistant-Secretary would forthwith seat him with the books before him,\r\nabsence of F.R.S. not in any wise withstanding. But this is not like having\r\nthe right to consult any book on any day, and to take it away, if farther\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\nSo much for the Royal Society as concerns myself. I must add that there is\r\nnot a spark of party feeling against those who wilfully remain outside. The\r\nbetter minds of course know better; and the smaller _savants_ look\r\ncomplacently on the idea of an outer world which makes _elite_ of them. I\r\nhave done such a thing as serve on a committee of the Society, and report\r\non a paper: they had the sense to ask, and I had the sense to see that none\r\nof my opinions were compromised by compliance. And I will be of any use\r\nwhich does not involve the status of _homo trium literarum_; as I have\r\nelsewhere explained, I would gladly be _Fautor Realis Scientiae_, but I\r\nwould not be taken for _Falsae Rationis Sacerdos_.\r\n\r\nNothing worse will ever happen to me than the smile which individuals\r\nbestow on a man who does not _groove_. Wisdom, like religion, belongs to\r\nmajorities; who can {31} wonder that it should be so thought, when it is so\r\nclearly pictured in the New Testament from one end to the other?\r\n\r\nThe counterpart of _paradox_, the isolated opinion of one or of few, is the\r\ngeneral opinion held by all the rest; and the counterpart of false and\r\nabsurd paradox is what is called the \"vulgar error,\" the _pseudodox_. There\r\nis one great work on this last subject, the _Pseudodoxia Epidemica_ of Sir\r\nThomas Browne, the famous author of the _Religio Medici_; it usually goes\r\nby the name of Browne \"On Vulgar Errors\" (1st ed. 1646; 6th, 1672). A\r\ncareful analysis of this work would show that vulgar errors are frequently\r\nopposed by scientific errors; but good sense is always good sense, and\r\nBrowne's book has a vast quantity of it.\r\n\r\nAs an example of bad philosophy brought against bad observation. The\r\nAmphisbaena serpent was supposed to have two heads, one at each end; partly\r\nfrom its shape, partly because it runs backwards as well as forwards. On\r\nthis Sir Thomas Browne makes the following remarks:\r\n\r\n\"And were there any such species or natural kind of animal, it would be\r\nhard to make good those six positions of body which, according to the three\r\ndimensions, are ascribed unto every Animal; that is, _infra_, _supra_,\r\n_ante_, _retro_, _dextrosum_, _sinistrosum_: for if (as it is determined)\r\nthat be the anterior and upper part wherein the senses are placed, and that\r\nthe posterior and lower part which is opposite thereunto, there is no\r\ninferior or former part in this Animal; for the senses, being placed at\r\nboth extreams, doth make both ends anterior, which is impossible; the terms\r\nbeing Relative, which mutually subsist, and are not without each other. And\r\ntherefore this duplicity was ill contrived to place one head at both\r\nextreams, and had been more tolerable to have settled three or four at one.\r\nAnd therefore also Poets have been more reasonable than Philosophers, and\r\n_Geryon_ or _Cerberus_ less monstrous than _Amphisbaena_.\" {32}\r\n\r\nThere may be paradox upon paradox: and there is a good instance in the\r\neighth century in the case of Virgil, an Irishman, Bishop of Salzburg and\r\nafterwards Saint, and his quarrels with Boniface, an Englishman, Archbishop\r\nof Mentz, also afterwards Saint. All we know about the matter is, that\r\nthere exists a letter of 748 from Pope Zachary, citing Virgil--then, it\r\nseems, at most a simple priest, though the Pope was not sure even of\r\nthat--to Rome to answer the charge of maintaining that there is another\r\nworld (_mundus_) under our earth (_terra_), with another sun and another\r\nmoon. Nothing more is known: the letter contains threats in the event of\r\nthe charge being true; and there history drops the matter. Since Virgil was\r\nafterwards a Bishop and a Saint, we may fairly conclude that he died in the\r\nfull flower of his orthodox reputation. It has been supposed--and it seems\r\nprobable--that Virgil maintained that the earth is peopled all the way\r\nround, so that under some spots there are antipodes; that his\r\ncontemporaries, with very dim ideas about the roundness of the earth, and\r\nmost of them with none at all, interpreted him as putting another earth\r\nunder ours--turned the other way, probably, like the second piece of\r\nbread-and-butter in a sandwich, with a sun and moon of its own. In the\r\neighth century this would infallibly have led to an underground Gospel, an\r\nunderground Pope, and an underground Avignon for him to live in. When, in\r\nlater times, the idea of inhabitants for the planets was started, it was\r\nimmediately asked whether they had sinned, whether Jesus Christ died for\r\n_them_, whether their wine and their water could be lawfully used in the\r\nsacraments, etc.\r\n\r\nOn so small a basis as the above has been constructed a companion case to\r\nthe persecution of Galileo. On one side the positive assertion, with\r\nindignant comment, that Virgil was deposed for antipodal heresy, on the\r\nother, serious attempts at justification, palliation, or mystification.\r\nSome writers say that Virgil was found guilty; others that he gave\r\nsatisfactory explanation, and became very good friends with {33} Boniface:\r\nfor all which see Bayle. Some have maintained that the antipodist was a\r\ndifferent person from the canonized bishop: there is a second Virgil, made\r\nto order. When your shoes pinch, and will not stretch, always throw them\r\naway and get another pair: the same with your facts. Baronius was not up to\r\nthe plan of a substitute: his commentator Pagi (probably writing about\r\n1690) argues for it in a manner which I think Baronius would not have\r\napproved. This Virgil was perhaps a slippery fellow. The Pope says he hears\r\nthat Virgil pretended licence from him to claim one of some new bishoprics:\r\nthis he declares is totally false. It is part of the argument that such a\r\nman as this could not have been created a Bishop and a Saint: on this point\r\nthere will be opinions and opinions.[10]\r\n\r\nLactantius, four centuries before, had laughed at the antipodes in a manner\r\nwhich seems to be ridicule thrown on the idea of the earth's roundness.\r\nPtolemy, without reference to the antipodes, describes the extent of the\r\ninhabited part of the globe in a way which shows that he could have had no\r\nobjection to men turned opposite ways. Probably, in the eighth century, the\r\nroundness of the earth was matter of thought only to astronomers. It should\r\nalways be remembered, especially by those who affirm persecution of a true\r\nopinion, that but for our knowing from Lactantius that the antipodal notion\r\nhad been matter of assertion and denial among theologians, we could never\r\nhave had any great confidence in Virgil really having maintained the simple\r\ntheory of the existence of antipodes. And even now we are not entitled to\r\naffirm it as having historical proof: the evidence {34} goes to Virgil\r\nhaving been charged with very absurd notions, which it seems more likely\r\nthan not were the absurd constructions which ignorant contemporaries put\r\nupon sensible opinions of his.\r\n\r\nOne curious part of this discussion is that neither side has allowed Pope\r\nZachary to produce evidence to character. He shall have been an Urban, say\r\nthe astronomers; an Urban he ought to have been, say the theologians. What\r\nsort of man was Zachary? He was eminently sensible and conciliatory; he\r\ncontrived to make northern barbarians hear reason in a way which puts him\r\nhigh among that section of the early popes who had the knack of managing\r\nuneducated swordsmen. He kept the peace in Italy to an extent which\r\nhistorians mention with admiration. Even Bale, that Maharajah of\r\npope-haters, allows himself to quote in favor of Zachary, that \"multa\r\nPapalem dignitatem decentia, eademque praeclara (scilicet) opera\r\nconfecit.\"[11] And this, though so willing to find fault that, speaking of\r\nZachary putting a little geographical description of the earth on the\r\nportico of the Lateran Church, he insinuates that it was intended to affirm\r\nthat the Pope was lord of the whole. Nor can he say how long Zachary held\r\nthe see, except by announcing his death in 752, \"cum decem annis\r\npestilentiae sedi praefuisset.\"[12]\r\n\r\nThere was another quarrel between Virgil and Boniface which is an\r\nillustration. An ignorant priest had baptized \"in nomine Patri_a_, et\r\nFili_a_ et Spiritu_a_ Sancta.\" Boniface declared the rite null and void:\r\nVirgil maintained the contrary; and Zachary decided in favor of Virgil, on\r\nthe ground that the absurd form was only ignorance of Latin, and not\r\nheresy. It is hard to believe that this man deposed a priest for asserting\r\nthe whole globe to be inhabited. To me the little information that we have\r\nseems {35} to indicate--but not with certainty--that Virgil maintained the\r\nantipodes: that his ignorant contemporaries travestied his theory into that\r\nof an underground cosmos; that the Pope cited him to Rome to explain his\r\nsystem, which, as reported, looked like what all would then have affirmed\r\nto be heresy; that he gave satisfactory explanations, and was dismissed\r\nwith honor. It may be that the educated Greek monk, Zachary, knew his\r\nPtolemy well enough to guess what the asserted heretic would say; we have\r\nseen that he seems to have patronized geography. The _description_ of the\r\nearth, according to historians, was a _map_; this Pope may have been more\r\nready than another to prick up his ears at any rumor of geographical\r\nheresy, from hope of information. And Virgil, who may have entered the\r\nsacred presence as frightened as Jacquard, when Napoleon I sent for him and\r\nsaid, with a stern voice and threatening gesture, \"You are the man who can\r\ntie a knot in a stretched string,\" may have departed as well pleased as\r\nJacquard with the riband and pension which the interview was worth to him.\r\n\r\nA word more about Baronius. If he had been pope, as he would have been but\r\nfor the opposition of the Spaniards, and if he had lived ten years longer\r\nthan he did, and if Clavius, who would have been his astronomical adviser,\r\nhad lived five years longer than he did, it is probable, nay almost\r\ncertain, that the great exhibition, the proceeding against Galileo, would\r\nnot have furnished a joke against theology in all time to come. For\r\nBaronius was sensible and witty enough to say that in the Scriptures the\r\nHoly Spirit intended to teach how to go to Heaven, not how Heaven goes; and\r\nClavius, in his last years, confessed that the whole system of the heavens\r\nhad broken down, and must be mended.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the Galileo case, a reality, and the Virgil case, a\r\nfiction, have been hawked against the Roman see are enough to show that the\r\nPope and his adherents have not cared much about physical philosophy. In\r\ntruth, orthodoxy has always had other fish to fry. Physics, which {36} in\r\nmodern times has almost usurped the name _philosophy_, in England at least,\r\nhas felt a little disposed to clothe herself with all the honors of\r\npersecution which belong to the real owner of the name. But the bishops,\r\netc. of the Middle Ages knew that the contest between nominalism and\r\nrealism, for instance, had a hundred times more bearing upon orthodoxy than\r\nanything in astronomy, etc. A wrong notion about _substance_ might play the\r\nmischief with _transubstantiation_.\r\n\r\nThe question of the earth's motion was the single point in which orthodoxy\r\ncame into real contact with science. Many students of physics were\r\nsuspected of magic, many of atheism: but, stupid as the mistake may have\r\nbeen, it was _bona fide_ the magic or the atheism, not the physics, which\r\nwas assailed. In the astronomical case it was the very doctrine, as a\r\ndoctrine, independently of consequences, which was the _corpus delicti_:\r\nand this because it contradicted the Bible. And so it did; for the\r\nstability of the earth is as clearly assumed from one end of the Old\r\nTestament to the other as the solidity of iron. Those who take the Bible to\r\nbe _totidem verbis_ dictated by the God of Truth can refuse to believe it;\r\nand they make strange reasons. They undertake, _a priori_, to settle Divine\r\nintentions. The Holy Spirit did not _mean_ to teach natural philosophy:\r\nthis they know beforehand; or else they infer it from finding that the\r\nearth does move, and the Bible says it does not. Of course, ignorance\r\napart, every word is truth, or the writer did not mean truth. But this puts\r\nthe whole book on its trial: for we never can find out what the writer\r\nmeant, until we otherwise find out what is true. Those who like may, of\r\ncourse, declare for an inspiration over which they are to be viceroys; but\r\ncommon sense will either accept verbal meaning or deny verbal inspiration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{37}\r\n\r\nA BUDGET OF PARADOXES.\r\n\r\nVOLUME I.\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF BURIDAN'S ASS.\r\n\r\n    Questiones Morales, folio, 1489 [Paris]. By T. Buridan.\r\n\r\nThis is the title from the Hartwell Catalogue of Law Books. I suppose it is\r\nwhat is elsewhere called the \"Commentary on the Ethics of Aristotle,\"\r\nprinted in 1489.[13] Buridan[14] (died about 1358) is the creator of the\r\nfamous ass which, as _Burdin's_[15] ass, was current in Burgundy, perhaps\r\nis, as a vulgar proverb. Spinoza[16] says it was a jenny ass, and that a\r\nman would not have been so foolish; but whether the compliment is paid to\r\nhuman or to masculine character does not appear--perhaps to both in one.\r\nThe story _told_ about the famous paradox is very curious. The Queen of\r\nFrance, Joanna or Jeanne, was in the habit of sewing her lovers up in\r\nsacks, and throwing them into the Seine; not for blabbing, but that they\r\nmight not blab--certainly the safer plan. Buridan was exempted, and, in\r\ngratitude, invented the sophism. What it has to do with the matter {38} has\r\nnever been explained. Assuredly _qui facit per alium facit per se_ will\r\nconvict Buridan of prating. The argument is as follows, and is seldom told\r\nin full. Buridan was for free-will--that is, will which determines conduct,\r\nlet motives be ever so evenly balanced. An ass is _equally_ pressed by\r\nhunger and by thirst; a bundle of hay is on one side, a pail of water on\r\nthe other. Surely, you will say, he will not be ass enough to die for want\r\nof food or drink; he will then make a choice--that is, will choose between\r\nalternatives of equal force. The problem became famous in the schools; some\r\nallowed the poor donkey to die of indecision; some denied the possibility\r\nof the balance, which was no answer at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMICHAEL SCOTT'S DEVILS.\r\n\r\nThe following question is more difficult, and involves free-will to all who\r\nanswer--\"Which you please.\" If the northern hemisphere were land, and all\r\nthe southern hemisphere water, ought we to call the northern hemisphere an\r\nisland, or the southern hemisphere a lake? Both the questions would be good\r\nexercises for paradoxers who must be kept employed, like Michael\r\nScott's[17] devils. The wizard {39} knew nothing about squaring the circle,\r\netc., so he set them to make ropes out of sea sand, which puzzled them.\r\nStupid devils; much of our glass is sea sand, and it makes beautiful\r\nthread. Had Michael set them to square the circle or to find a perpetual\r\nmotion, he would have done his work much better. But all this is\r\nconjecture: who knows that I have not hit on the very plan he adopted?\r\nPerhaps the whole race of paradoxers on hopeless subjects are Michael's\r\nsubordinates, condemned to transmigration after transmigration, until their\r\ntask is done.\r\n\r\nThe above was not a bad guess. A little after the time when the famous\r\nPascal papers[18] were produced, I came into possession of a correspondence\r\nwhich, but for these papers, I should have held too incredible to be put\r\nbefore the world. But when one sheep leaps the ditch, another will follow:\r\nso I gave the following account in the _Athenaeum_ of October 5, 1867:\r\n\r\n\"The recorded story is that Michael Scott, being bound by contract to\r\nproduce perpetual employment for a number of young demons, was worried out\r\nof his life in inventing jobs for them, until at last he set them to make\r\nropes out of sea sand, which they never could do. We have obtained a very\r\ncurious correspondence between the wizard Michael and his demon-slaves; but\r\nwe do not feel at liberty to say how it came into our hands. We much regret\r\nthat we did not receive it in time for the British Association. It appears\r\nthat the story, true as far as it goes, was never finished. The demons\r\neasily conquered the rope difficulty, by the simple process of making the\r\nsand into glass, and spinning the glass into thread, which they twisted.\r\nMichael, thoroughly disconcerted, hit upon the plan of setting some to {40}\r\nsquare the circle, others to find the perpetual motion, etc. He commanded\r\neach of them to transmigrate from one human body into another, until their\r\ntasks were done. This explains the whole succession of cyclometers, and all\r\nthe heroes of the Budget. Some of this correspondence is very recent; it is\r\nmuch blotted, and we are not quite sure of its meaning: it is full of\r\nfigurative allusions to driving something illegible down a steep into the\r\nsea. It looks like a humble petition to be allowed some diversion in the\r\nintervals of transmigration; and the answer is--\r\n\r\n  Rumpat et serpens iter institutum,[19]\r\n\r\n--a line of Horace, which the demons interpret as a direction to come\r\nathwart the proceedings of the Institute by a sly trick. Until we saw this,\r\nwe were suspicious of M. Libri,[20] the unvarying blunders of the\r\ncorrespondence look like knowledge. To be always out of the road requires a\r\nmap: genuine ignorance occasionally lapses into truth. We thought it\r\npossible M. Libri might have played the trick to show how easily the French\r\nare deceived; but with our present information, our minds are at rest on\r\nthe subject. We see M. Chasles does not like to avow the real source of\r\ninformation: he will not confess himself a spiritualist.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILO OF GADARA.\r\n\r\nPhilo of Gadara[21] is asserted by Montucla,[22] on the {41} authority of\r\nEutocius,[23] the commentator on Archimedes, to have squared the circle\r\nwithin the _ten-thousandth_ part of a unit, that is, to _four_ places of\r\ndecimals. A modern classical dictionary represents it as done by Philo to\r\n_ten thousand_ places of decimals. Lacroix comments on Montucla to the\r\neffect that _myriad_ (in Greek _ten thousand_) is here used as we use it,\r\nvaguely, for an immense number. On looking into Eutocius, I find that not\r\none definite word is said about the extent to which Philo carried the\r\nmatter. I give a translation of the passage:\r\n\r\n\"We ought to know that Apollonius Pergaeus, in his Ocytocium [this work is\r\nlost], demonstrated the same by other numbers, and came nearer, which seems\r\nmore accurate, but has nothing to do with Archimedes; for, as before said,\r\nhe aimed only at going near enough for the wants of life. Neither is Porus\r\nof Nicaea fair when he takes Archimedes to task for not giving a line\r\naccurately equal to the circumference. He says in his Cerii that his\r\nteacher, Philo of Gadara, had given a more accurate approximation ([Greek:\r\neis akribesterous arithmous agagein]) than that of Archimedes, or than 7 to\r\n22. But all these [the rest as well as Philo] miss the intention. They\r\nmultiply and divide by _tens of thousands_, which no one can easily do,\r\nunless he be versed in the logistics [fractional computation] of Magnus\r\n[now unknown].\"\r\n\r\nMontucla, or his source, ought not to have made this mistake. He had been\r\nat the Greek to correct Philo _Gadetanus_, as he had often been called, and\r\nhe had brought away {42} and quoted [Greek: apo Gadaron]. Had he read two\r\nsentences further, he would have found the mistake.\r\n\r\nWe here detect a person quite unnoticed hitherto by the moderns, Magnus the\r\narithmetician. The phrase is ironical; it is as if we should say, \"To do\r\nthis a man must be deep in Cocker.\"[24] Accordingly, Magnus, Baveme,[25]\r\nand Cocker, are three personifications of arithmetic; and there may be\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON SQUARING THE CIRCLE.\r\n\r\nAristotle, treating of the category of relation, denies that the quadrature\r\nhas been found, but appears to assume that it can be done. Boethius,[26] in\r\nhis comment on the passage, says that it has been done since Aristotle, but\r\nthat the demonstration is too long for him to give. Those who have no\r\nnotion of the quadrature question may look at the _English Cyclopaedia_,\r\nart. \"Quadrature of the Circle.\"\r\n\r\n    Tetragonismus. Id est circuli quadratura per Campanum, Archimedem\r\n    Syracusanum, atque Boetium mathematicae perspicacissimos adinventa.--At\r\n    the end, Impressum Venetiis per Ioan. Bapti. Sessa. Anno ab\r\n    incarnatione Domini, 1503. Die 28 Augusti.\r\n\r\n{43}\r\n\r\nThis book has never been noticed in the history of the subject, and I\r\ncannot find any mention of it. The quadrature of Campanus[27] takes the\r\nratio of Archimedes,[28] 7 to 22 to be absolutely correct; the account\r\ngiven of Archimedes is not a translation of his book; and that of Boetius\r\nhas more than is in Boet_h_ius. This book must stand, with the next, as the\r\nearliest in print on the subject, until further showing: Murhard[29] and\r\nKastner[30] have nothing so early. It is edited by Lucas Gauricus,[31] who\r\nhas given a short preface. Luca Gaurico, Bishop of Civita Ducale, an\r\nastrologer of astrologers, published this work at about thirty years of\r\nage, and lived to eighty-two. His works are collected in folios, but I do\r\nnot know whether they contain this production. The poor fellow could never\r\ntell his own fortune, because his father neglected to note the hour and\r\nminute of his birth. But if there had been anything in astrology, he could\r\nhave worked back, as Adams[32] and Leverrier[33] did when they caught {44}\r\nNeptune: at sixty he could have examined every minute of his day of birth,\r\nby the events of his life, and so would have found the right minute. He\r\ncould then have gone on, by rules of prophecy. Gauricus was the\r\nmathematical teacher of Joseph Scaliger,[34] who did him no credit, as we\r\nshall see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOVILLUS ON THE QUADRATURE PROBLEM.\r\n\r\n    In hoc opere contenta Epitome.... Liber de quadratura Circuli....\r\n    Paris, 1503, folio.\r\n\r\nThe quadrator is Charles Bovillus,[35] who adopted the views of Cardinal\r\nCusa,[36] presently mentioned. Montucla is hard on his compatriot, who, he\r\nsays, was only saved from the laughter of geometers by his obscurity.\r\nPersons must guard against most historians of mathematics in one point:\r\nthey frequently attribute to _his own_ age the obscurity which a writer has\r\nin _their own_ time. This tract was printed by Henry Stephens,[37] at the\r\ninstigation of Faber Stapulensis,[38] {45} and is recorded by Dechales,[39]\r\netc. It was also introduced into the _Margarita Philosophica_ of 1815,[40]\r\nin the same appendix with the new perspective from Viator. This is not\r\nextreme obscurity, by any means. The quadrature deserved it; but that is\r\nanother point.\r\n\r\nIt is stated by Montucla that Bovillus makes [pi] = [root]10. But Montucla\r\ncites a work of 1507, _Introductorium Geometricum_, which I have never\r\nseen.[41] He finds in it an account which Bovillus gives of the quadrature\r\nof the peasant laborer, and describes it as agreeing with his own. But the\r\ndescription makes [pi] = 3-1/8, which it thus appears Bovillus could not\r\ndistinguish from [root]10. It seems also that this 3-1/8, about which we\r\nshall see so much in the sequel, takes its rise in the thoughtful head of a\r\npoor laborer. It does him great honor, being so near the truth, and he\r\nhaving no means of instruction. In our day, when an ignorant person chooses\r\nto bring his fancy forward in opposition to demonstration which he will not\r\nstudy, he is deservedly laughed at.\r\n\r\n{46}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF LACOMME'S ATTEMPT AT QUADRATURE.\r\n\r\nMr. James Smith,[42] of Liverpool--hereinafter notorified--attributes the\r\nfirst announcement of 3-1/8 to M. Joseph Lacomme, a French well-sinker, of\r\nwhom he gives the following account:\r\n\r\n\"In the year 1836, at which time Lacomme could neither read nor write, he\r\nhad constructed a circular reservoir and wished to know the quantity of\r\nstone that would be required to pave the bottom, and for this purpose\r\ncalled on a professor of mathematics. On putting his question and giving\r\nthe diameter, he was surprised at getting the following answer from the\r\nProfessor: _'Qu'il lui etait impossible de le lui dire au juste, attendu\r\nque personne n'avait encore pu trouver d'une maniere exacte le rapport de\r\nla circonference au diametre.'_[43] From this he was led to attempt the\r\nsolution of the problem. His first process was purely mechanical, and he\r\nwas so far convinced he had made the discovery that he took to educating\r\nhimself, and became an expert arithmetician, and then found that\r\narithmetical results agreed with his mechanical experiments. He appears to\r\nhave eked out a bare existence for many years by teaching arithmetic, all\r\nthe time struggling to get a hearing from some of the learned societies,\r\nbut without success. In the year 1855 he found his way to Paris, where, as\r\nif by accident, he made the acquaintance of a young gentleman, son of M.\r\nWinter, a commissioner of police, and taught him his peculiar methods of\r\ncalculation. The young man was so enchanted that he strongly recommended\r\nLacomme to his father, and {47} subsequently through M. Winter he obtained\r\nan introduction to the President of the Society of Arts and Sciences of\r\nParis. A committee of the society was appointed to examine and report upon\r\nhis discovery, and the society at its _seance_ of March 17, 1856, awarded a\r\nsilver medal of the first class to M. Joseph Lacomme for his discovery of\r\nthe true ratio of diameter to circumference in a circle. He subsequently\r\nreceived three other medals from other societies. While writing this I have\r\nhis likeness before me, with his medals on his breast, which stands as a\r\nfrontispiece to a short biography of this extraordinary man, for which I am\r\nindebted to the gentleman who did me the honor to publish a French\r\ntranslation of the pamphlet I distributed at the meeting of the British\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science, at Oxford, in\r\n1860.\"--_Correspondent_, May 3, 1866.\r\n\r\nMy inquiries show that the story of the medals is not incredible. There are\r\nat Paris little private societies which have not so much claim to be\r\nexponents of scientific opinion as our own Mechanics' Institutes. Some of\r\nthem were intended to give a false lustre: as the \"Institut Historique,\"\r\nthe members of which are \"Membre de l'Institut Historique.\" That M. Lacomme\r\nshould have got four medals from societies of this class is very possible:\r\nthat he should have received one from any society at Paris which has the\r\nleast claim to give one is as yet simply incredible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNICOLAUS OF CUSA'S ATTEMPT.\r\n\r\n    Nicolai de Cusa Opera Omnia. Venice, 1514. 3 vols. folio.\r\n\r\nThe real title is \"Haec accurata recognitio trium voluminum operum clariss.\r\nP. Nicolai Cusae ... proxime sequens pagina monstrat.\"[44] Cardinal Cusa,\r\nwho died in 1464, is one of the earliest modern attempters. His quadrature\r\nis found in the second volume, and is now quite unreadable.\r\n\r\n{48} In these early days every quadrator found a geometrical opponent, who\r\nfinished him. Regimontanus[45] did this office for the Cardinal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY CORNELIUS AGRIPPA.\r\n\r\n    De Occulta Philosophia libri III. By Henry Cornelius Agrippa. Lyons,\r\n    1550, 8vo.\r\n\r\n    De incertitudine et vanitate scientiarum. By the same. Cologne, 1531,\r\n    8vo.\r\n\r\nThe first editions of these works were of 1530, as well as I can make out;\r\nbut the first was in progress in 1510.[46] In the second work Agrippa\r\nrepents of having wasted time on the magic of the first; but all those who\r\nactually deal with demons are destined to eternal fire with Jamnes and\r\nMambres and Simon Magus. This means, as is the fact, that his occult\r\nphilosophy did not actually enter upon _black_ magic, but confined itself\r\nto the power of the stars, of numbers, etc. The fourth book, which appeared\r\nafter the death of Agrippa, and really concerns dealing with evil spirits,\r\nis undoubtedly spurious. It is very difficult to make out what Agrippa\r\nreally believed on the subject. I have introduced his books as the most\r\nmarked specimens of treatises on magic, a paradox of our day, though not\r\nfar from orthodoxy in his; and here I should have ended my notice, if I had\r\nnot casually found something more interesting to the reader of our day.\r\n\r\n{49}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHICH LEADS TO WALTER SCOTT.\r\n\r\nWalter Scott, it is well known, was curious on all matters connected with\r\nmagic, and has used them very widely. But it is hardly known how much pains\r\nhe has taken to be correct, and to give the real thing. The most decided\r\ndetail of a magical process which is found in his writings is that of\r\nDousterswivel in _The Antiquary_; and it is obvious, by his accuracy of\r\nprocess, that he does not intend the adept for a mere impostor, but for one\r\nwho had a lurking belief in the efficacy of his own processes, coupled with\r\nintent to make a fraudulent use of them. The materials for the process are\r\ntaken from Agrippa. I first quote Mr. Dousterswivel:\r\n\r\n\"... I take a silver plate when she [the moon] is in her fifteenth mansion,\r\nwhich mansion is in de head of _Libra_, and I engrave upon one side de\r\nworts _Schedbarschemoth Scharta_ch_an_ [_ch_ should be _t_]--dat is, de\r\nIntelligence of de Intelligence of de moon--and I make his picture like a\r\nflying serpent with a turkey-cock's head--vary well--Then upon this side I\r\nmake de table of de moon, which is a square of nine, multiplied into\r\nitself, with eighty-one numbers [nine] on every side and diameter nine....\"\r\n\r\nIn the _De Occulta Philosophia_, p. 290, we find that the fifteenth mansion\r\nof the moon _incipit capite Librae_, and is good _pro extrahendis\r\nthesauris_, the object being to discover hidden treasure. In p. 246, we\r\nlearn that a _silver_ plate must be used with the moon. In p. 248, we have\r\nthe words which denote the Intelligence, etc. But, owing to the falling of\r\na number into a wrong line, or the misplacement of a line, one or\r\nother--which takes place in all the editions I have examined--Scott has,\r\nsad to say, got hold of the wrong words; he has written down the _demon of\r\nthe demons_ of the moon. Instead of the gibberish above, it should have\r\nbeen _Malcha betarsisim hed beruah schenhakim_. In p. 253, we have the\r\nmagic square of the moon, with eighty-one numbers, and the symbol for the\r\nIntelligence, which Scott likens to a flying {50} serpent with a\r\nturkey-cock's head. He was obliged to say something; but I will stake my\r\ncharacter--and so save a woodcut--on the scratches being more like a pair\r\nof legs, one shorter than the other, without a body, jumping over a\r\nsix-barred gate placed side uppermost. Those who thought that Scott forged\r\nhis own nonsense, will henceforth stand corrected. As to the spirit\r\nPeolphan, etc., no doubt Scott got it from the authors he elsewhere\r\nmentions, Nicolaus Remigius[47] and Petrus Thyracus; but this last word\r\nshould be Thyraeus.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of Scott's mind towards prophecy is very marked, and it is\r\nalways fulfilled. Hyder, in his disguise, calls out to Tippoo: \"Cursed is\r\nthe prince who barters justice for lust; he shall die in the gate by the\r\nsword of the stranger.\" Tippoo was killed in a gateway at Seringapatam.[48]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINAEUS ON CIRCLE SQUARING.\r\n\r\n    Orontii Finaei ... Quadratura Circuli. Paris, 1544, 4to.\r\n\r\nOrontius[49] squared the circle out of all comprehension; but he was killed\r\nby a feather from his own wing. His {51} former pupil, John Buteo,[50] the\r\nsame who--I believe for the first time--calculated the question of Noah's\r\nark, as to its power to hold all the animals and stores, unsquared him\r\ncompletely. Orontius was the author of very many works, and died in 1555.\r\nAmong the laudatory verses which, as was usual, precede this work, there is\r\none of a rare character: a congratulatory ode to the wife of the author.\r\nThe French now call this writer Oronce Finee; but there is much difficulty\r\nabout delatinization. Is this more correct than Oronce Fine, which the\r\ntranslator of De Thou uses? Or than Horonce Phine, which older writers\r\ngive? I cannot understand why M. de Viette[51] should be called Viete,\r\nbecause his Latin name is Vieta. It is difficult to restore Buteo; for not\r\nonly now is _butor_ a blockhead as well as a bird, but we really cannot\r\nknow what kind of bird Buteo stood for. We may be sure that Madame Fine was\r\nDenise Blanche; for Dionysia Candida can mean nothing else. Let her shade\r\nrejoice in the fame which Hubertus Sussannaeus has given her.\r\n\r\nI ought to add that the quadrature of Orontius, and solutions of all the\r\nother difficulties, were first published in _De Rebus Mathematicis Hactenus\r\nDesideratis_,[52] of which I have not the date.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{52}\r\n\r\nDUCHESNE, AND A DISQUISITION ON ETYMOLOGY.\r\n\r\n    Nicolai Raymari Ursi Dithmarsi Fundamentum Astronomicum, id est, nova\r\n    doctrina sinuum et triangulorum.... Strasburg, 1588, 4to.[53]\r\n\r\nPeople choose the name of this astronomer for themselves: I take _Ursus_,\r\nbecause he _was_ a bear. This book gave the quadrature of Simon\r\nDuchesne,[54] or a Quercu, which excited Peter Metius,[55] as presently\r\nnoticed. It also gave that unintelligible reference to Justus Byrgius which\r\nhas been used in the discussion about the invention of logarithms.[56]\r\n\r\nThe real name of Duchesne is Van der Eycke. I have met with a tract in\r\nDutch, _Letterkundige Aanteekeningen_, upon Van Eycke, Van Ceulen,[57]\r\netc., by J. J. Dodt van Flensburg,[58] which I make out to be since 1841 in\r\ndate. I should {53} much like a translation of this tract to be printed,\r\nsay in the _Phil. Mag._ Dutch would be clear English if it were properly\r\nspelt. For example, _learn-master_ would be seen at once to be _teacher_;\r\nbut they will spell it _leermeester_. _Of these_ they write as _van deze_;\r\n_widow_ they make _weduwe_. All this is plain to me, who never saw a Dutch\r\ndictionary in my life; but many of their misspellings are quite\r\nunconquerable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFALCO'S RARE TRACT.\r\n\r\n    Jacobus Falco Valentinus, miles Ordinis Montesiani, hanc circuli\r\n    quadraturam invenit. Antwerp, 1589, 4to.[59]\r\n\r\nThe attempt is more than commonly worthless; but as Montucla and others\r\nhave referred to the verses at the end, and as the tract is of the rarest,\r\nI will quote them:\r\n\r\n      _Circulus loquitur._\r\n  Vocabar ante circulus\r\n  Eramque curvus undique\r\n  Ut alta solis orbita\r\n  Et arcus ille nubium.\r\n  Eram figura nobilis\r\n  Carensque sola origine\r\n  Carensque sola termino.\r\n  Modo indecora prodeo\r\n  Novisque foedor angulis.\r\n  Nec hoc peregit Archytas[60]\r\n  Neque Icari pater neque\r\n  Tuus, Iapete, filius.\r\n  Quis ergo casus aut Deus\r\n  Meam quadravit aream?\r\n\r\n      _Respondet auctor._\r\n  Ad alta Turiae ostia\r\n  Lacumque limpidissimum\r\n  Sita est beata civitas\r\n  {54}\r\n  Parum Saguntus abfuit\r\n  Abestque Sucro plusculum.\r\n  Hic est poeta quispiam\r\n  Libenter astra consulens\r\n  Sibique semper arrogans\r\n  Negata doctioribus,\r\n  Senex ubique cogitans\r\n  Sui frequenter immemor\r\n  Nec explicare circinum\r\n  Nec exarare lineas\r\n  Sciens ut ipse praedicat.\r\n  Hic ergo bellus artifex\r\n  Tuam quadravit aream.[61]\r\n\r\nFalco's verses are pretty, if the U-mysteries be correct; but of these\r\nthings I have forgotten--what I knew. [One mistake has been pointed out to\r\nme: it is Arch[=y]tas].\r\n\r\nAs a specimen of the way in which history is written, I copy the account\r\nwhich Montucla--who is accurate when he writes about what he has\r\nseen--gives of these verses. He gives the date 1587; he places the verses\r\nat the beginning instead of the end; he says the circle thanks its\r\nquadrator affectionately; and he says the good and modest chevalier gives\r\nall the glory to the patron saint of his order. All of little consequence,\r\nas it happens; but writing at second-hand makes as complete mistakes about\r\nmore important matters.\r\n\r\n{55}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUNGUS ON THE MYSTERY OF NUMBER.\r\n\r\n    Petri Bungi Bergomatis Numerorum mysteria. Bergomi [Bergamo], 1591,\r\n    4to. Second Edition.\r\n\r\nThe first edition is said to be of 1585;[62] the third, Paris, 1618. Bungus\r\nis not for my purpose on his own score, but those who gave the numbers\r\ntheir mysterious characters: he is but a collector. He quotes or uses 402\r\nauthors, as we are informed by his list; this just beats Warburton,[63]\r\nwhom some eulogist or satirist, I forget which, holds up as having used 400\r\nauthors in some one work. Bungus goes through 1, 2, 3, etc., and gives the\r\naccount of everything remarkable in which each number occurs; his accounts\r\nnot being always mysterious. The numbers which have nothing to say for\r\nthemselves are omitted: thus there is a gap between 50 and 60. In treating\r\n666, Bungus, a good Catholic, could not compliment the Pope with it, but he\r\nfixes it on Martin Luther with a little forcing. If from A to I represent\r\n1-10, from K to S 10-90, and from T to Z 100-500, we see:\r\n\r\n   M   A   R   T   I   N     L   U   T   E   R   A\r\n  30   1  80  100  9  40    20  200 100  5  80   1\r\n\r\nwhich gives 666. Again, in Hebrew, _Lulter_ does the same:\r\n\r\n  [Hebrew:   R    T    L    W   L]\r\n            200  400  30    6  30\r\n\r\nAnd thus two can play at any game. The second is better than the first: to\r\nLatinize the surname and not the Christian {56} name is very unscholarlike.\r\nThe last number mentioned is a thousand millions; all greater numbers are\r\ndismissed in half a page. Then follows an accurate distinction between\r\n_number_ and _multitude_--a thing much wanted both in arithmetic and logic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHICH LEADS TO A STORY ABOUT THE ROYAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nWhat may be the use of such a book as this? The last occasion on which it\r\nwas used was the following. Fifteen or sixteen years ago the Royal Society\r\ndetermined to restrict the number of yearly admissions to fifteen men of\r\nscience, and noblemen _ad libitum_; the men of science being selected and\r\nrecommended by the Council, with a power, since practically surrendered, to\r\nthe Society to elect more. This plan appears to me to be directly against\r\nthe spirit of their charter, the true intent of which is, that all who are\r\nfit should be allowed to promote natural knowledge in association, from and\r\nafter the time at which they are both fit and willing. It is also working\r\nmore absurdly from year to year; the tariff of fifteen per annum will soon\r\namount to the practical exclusion of many who would be very useful. This\r\nbegins to be felt already, I suspect. But, as appears above, the body of\r\nthe Society has the remedy in its own hands. When the alteration was\r\ndiscussed by the Council, my friend the late Mr. Galloway,[64] then one of\r\nthe body, opposed it strongly, and inquired particularly into the reason\r\nwhy _fifteen_, of all numbers, was the one to be selected. Was it because\r\nfifteen is seven and eight, typifying the Old Testament Sabbath, and the\r\nNew Testament day of the resurrection following? Was it because Paul strove\r\nfifteen days against Peter, proving that he was a doctor both of the Old\r\nand New Testament? Was it because the prophet Hosea bought a lady {57} for\r\nfifteen pieces of silver? Was it because, according to Micah, seven\r\nshepherds and eight chiefs should waste the Assyrians? Was it because\r\nEcclesiastes commands equal reverence to be given to both Testaments--such\r\nwas the interpretation--in the words \"Give a portion to seven, and also to\r\neight\"? Was it because the waters of the Deluge rose fifteen cubits above\r\nthe mountains?--or because they lasted fifteen decades of days? Was it\r\nbecause Ezekiel's temple had fifteen steps? Was it because Jacob's ladder\r\nhas been supposed to have had fifteen steps? Was it because fifteen years\r\nwere added to the life of Hezekiah? Was it because the feast of unleavened\r\nbread was on the fifteenth day of the month? Was it because the scene of\r\nthe Ascension was fifteen stadia from Jerusalem? Was it because the\r\nstone-masons and porters employed in Solomon's temple amounted to fifteen\r\nmyriads? etc. The Council were amused and astounded by the volley of\r\nfifteens which was fired at them; they knowing nothing about Bungus, of\r\nwhich Mr. Galloway--who did not, as the French say, indicate his\r\nsources--possessed the copy now before me. In giving this anecdote I give a\r\nspecimen of the book, which is exceedingly rare. Should another edition\r\never appear, which is not very probable, he would be but a bungling Bungus\r\nwho should forget the _fifteen_ of the Royal Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAND ALSO TO A QUESTION OF EVIDENCE.\r\n\r\n[I make a remark on the different colors which the same person gives to one\r\nstory, according to the bias under which he tells it. My friend Galloway\r\ntold me how he had quizzed the Council of the Royal Society, to my great\r\namusement. Whenever I am struck by the words of any one, I carry away a\r\nvivid recollection of position, gestures, tones, etc. I do not know whether\r\nthis be common or uncommon. I never recall this joke without seeing before\r\nme my friend, leaning against his bookcase, with Bungus open in his hand,\r\nand a certain half-depreciatory tone which he often used {58} when speaking\r\nof himself. Long after his death, an F.R.S. who was present at the\r\ndiscussion, told me the story. I did not say I had heard it, but I watched\r\nhim, with Galloway at the bookcase before me. I wanted to see whether the\r\ntwo would agree as to the fact of an enormous budget of fifteens having\r\nbeen fired at the Council, and they did agree perfectly. But when the\r\nparagraph of the Budget appeared in the _Athenaeum_, my friend, who seemed\r\nrather to object to the _showing-up_, assured me that the thing was grossly\r\nexaggerated; there was indeed a fifteen or two, but nothing like the number\r\nI had given. I had, however, taken sharp note of the previous narration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAND TO ANOTHER QUESTION OF EVIDENCE.\r\n\r\nI will give another instance. An Indian officer gave me an account of an\r\nelephant, as follows. A detachment was on the march, and one of the\r\ngun-carriages got a wheel off the track, so that it was also off the\r\nground, and hanging over a precipice. If the bullocks had moved a step,\r\ncarriages, bullocks, and all must have been precipitated. No one knew what\r\ncould be done until some one proposed to bring up an elephant, and let him\r\nmanage it his own way. The elephant took a moment's survey of the fix, put\r\nhis trunk under the axle of the free wheel, and waited. The surrounders,\r\nwho saw what he meant, moved the bullocks gently forward, the elephant\r\nfollowed, supporting the axle, until there was ground under the wheel, when\r\nhe let it quietly down. From all I had heard of the elephant, this was not\r\ntoo much to believe. But when, years afterwards, I reminded my friend of\r\nhis story, he assured me that I had misunderstood him, that the elephant\r\nwas _directed_ to put his trunk under the wheel, and saw in a moment why.\r\nThis is reasonable sagacity, and very likely the correct account; but I am\r\nquite sure that, in the fit of elephant-worship under which the story was\r\nfirst told, it was told as I have first stated it.] {59}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGIORDANO BRUNO AND HIS PARADOXES.\r\n\r\n    [Jordani Bruni Nolani de Monade, Numero et Figura ... item de\r\n    Innumerabilibus, Immenso, et Infigurabili ... Frankfort, 1591, 8vo.[65]\r\n\r\nI cannot imagine how I came to omit a writer whom I have known so many\r\nyears, unless the following story will explain it. The officer reproved the\r\nboatswain for perpetual swearing; the boatswain answered that he heard the\r\nofficers swear. \"Only in an emergency,\" said the officer. \"That's just it,\"\r\nreplied the other; \"a boatswain's life is a life of 'mergency.\" Giordano\r\nBruno was all paradox; and my mind was not alive to his paradoxes, just as\r\nmy ears might have become dead to the boatswain's oaths. He was, as has\r\nbeen said, a vorticist before Descartes,[66] an optimist before Leibnitz, a\r\nCopernican before Galileo. It would be easy to collect a hundred strange\r\nopinions of his. He was born about 1550, and was roasted alive at Rome,\r\nFebruary 17, 1600, for the maintenance and defence of the holy Church, and\r\nthe rights and liberties of the same. These last words are from the writ of\r\nour own good James I, under which Leggatt[67] was roasted at Smithfield, in\r\nMarch 1612; and if I had a copy of the instrument under which Wightman[68]\r\nwas roasted at Lichfield, a month afterwards, I daresay I should {60} find\r\nsomething quite as edifying. I extract an account which I gave of Bruno in\r\nthe _Comp. Alm._ for 1855:\r\n\r\n\"He was first a Dominican priest, then a Calvinist; and was roasted alive\r\nat Rome, in 1600, for as many heresies of opinion, religious and\r\nphilosophical, as ever lit one fire. Some defenders of the papal cause have\r\nat least worded their accusations so to be understood as imputing to him\r\nvillainous actions. But it is positively certain that his death was due to\r\nopinions alone, and that retractation, even after sentence, would have\r\nsaved him. There exists a remarkable letter, written from Rome on the very\r\nday of the murder, by Scioppius[69] (the celebrated scholar, a waspish\r\nconvert from Lutheranism, known by his hatred to Protestants and Jesuits)\r\nto Rittershusius,[70] a well-known Lutheran writer on civil and canon law,\r\nwhose works are in the index of prohibited books. This letter has been\r\nreprinted by Libri (vol. iv. p. 407). The writer informs his friend (whom\r\nhe wished to convince that even a Lutheran would have burnt Bruno) that all\r\nRome would tell him that Bruno died for Lutheranism; but this is because\r\nthe Italians do not know the difference between one heresy and another, in\r\nwhich simplicity (says the writer) may God preserve them. That is to say,\r\nthey knew the difference between a live heretic and a roasted one by actual\r\ninspection, but had no idea of the difference between a Lutheran and a\r\nCalvinist. The countrymen of Boccaccio would have smiled at the idea which\r\nthe German scholar entertained of them. They said Bruno was burnt for\r\nLutheranism, a name under which they classed all Protestants: and they are\r\nbetter witnesses than Schopp, or Scioppius. He then proceeds to describe to\r\nhis Protestant friend (to whom he would certainly not have omitted any act\r\nwhich both their churches would have condemned) the mass of opinions with\r\nwhich Bruno was charged; as that there {61} are innumerable worlds, that\r\nsouls migrate, that Moses was a magician, that the Scriptures are a dream,\r\nthat only the Hebrews descended from Adam and Eve, that the devils would be\r\nsaved, that Christ was a magician and deservedly put to death, etc. In\r\nfact, says he, Bruno has advanced all that was ever brought forward by all\r\nheathen philosophers, and by all heretics, ancient and modern. A time for\r\nretractation was given, both before sentence and after, which should be\r\nnoted, as well for the wretched palliation which it may afford, as for the\r\nadditional proof it gives that opinions, and opinions only, brought him to\r\nthe stake. In this medley of charges the Scriptures are a dream, while\r\nAdam, Eve, devils, and salvation are truths, and the Saviour a deceiver. We\r\nhave examined no work of Bruno except the _De Monade_, etc., mentioned in\r\nthe text. A strong though strange _theism_ runs through the whole, and\r\nMoses, Christ, the Fathers, etc., are cited in a manner which excites no\r\nremark either way. Among the versions of the cause of Bruno's death is\r\n_atheism_: but this word was very often used to denote rejection of\r\nrevelation, not merely in the common course of dispute, but by such\r\nwriters, for instance, as Brucker[71] and Morhof.[72] Thus Morhof says of\r\nthe _De Monade, etc._, that it exhibits no manifest signs of atheism. What\r\nhe means by the word is clear enough, when he thus speaks of a work which\r\nacknowledges God in hundreds of places, and rejects opinions as blasphemous\r\nin several. The work of Bruno in which his astronomical opinions are\r\ncontained is _De Monade, etc._ (Frankfort, 1591, 8vo). He is the most\r\nthorough-going Copernican possible, and throws out almost every opinion,\r\ntrue or false, which has ever been discussed by astronomers, from the\r\ntheory of innumerable inhabited worlds and systems to that {62} of the\r\nplanetary nature of comets. Libri (vol. iv)[73] has reprinted the most\r\nstriking part of his expressions of Copernican opinion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS LEADS TO THE CHURCH QUESTION.\r\n\r\nThe Satanic doctrine that a church may employ force in aid of its dogma is\r\nsupposed to be obsolete in England, except as an individual paradox; but\r\nthis is difficult to settle. Opinions are much divided as to what the Roman\r\nChurch would do in England, if she could: any one who doubts that she\r\nclaims the right does not deserve an answer. When the hopes of the\r\nTractarian section of the High Church were in bloom, before the most\r\nconspicuous intellects among them had _transgressed_ their ministry, that\r\nthey might go to their own place, I had the curiosity to see how far it\r\ncould be ascertained whether they held the only doctrine which makes me the\r\npersonal enemy of a sect. I found in one of their tracts the assumption of\r\na right to persecute, modified by an asserted conviction that force was not\r\nefficient. I cannot now say that this tract was one of the celebrated\r\nninety; and on looking at the collection I find it so poorly furnished with\r\ncontents, etc., that nothing but searching through three thick volumes\r\nwould decide. In these volumes I find, augmenting as we go on, declarations\r\nabout the character and power of \"the Church\" which have a suspicious\r\nappearance. The suspicion is increased by that curious piece of sophistry,\r\nNo. 87, on religious reserve. The queer paradoxes of that tract leave us in\r\ndoubt as to everything but this, that the church(man) is not bound to give\r\nhis whole counsel in all things, and not bound to say what the things are\r\nin which he does not give it. It is likely enough that some of the \"rights\r\nand liberties\" are but scantily described. There is now no fear; but the\r\ntime was when, if not fear, there might be a looking for of fear to come;\r\nnobody could then be so {63} sure as we now are that the lion was only\r\nasleep. There was every appearance of a harder fight at hand than was\r\nreally found needful.\r\n\r\nAmong other exquisite quirks of interpretation in the No. 87 above\r\nmentioned is the following. God himself employs reserve; he is said to be\r\ndecked with light as with a garment (the old or prayer-book version of\r\nPsalm civ. 2). To an ordinary apprehension this would be a strong image of\r\ndisplay, manifestation, revelation; but there is something more. \"Does not\r\na garment veil in some measure that which it clothes? Is not that very\r\nlight concealment?\"\r\n\r\nThis No. 87, admitted into a series, fixes upon the managers of the series,\r\nwho permitted its introduction, a strong presumption of that underhand\r\nintent with which they were charged. At the same time it is honorable to\r\nour liberty that this series could be published: though its promoters were\r\ngreatly shocked when the Essayists and Bishop Colenso[74] took a swing on\r\nthe other side. When No. 90 was under discussion, Dr. Maitland,[75] the\r\nlibrarian at Lambeth, asked Archbishop Howley[76] a question about No. 89.\r\n\"I did not so much as know there _was_ a No. 89,\" was the answer. I am\r\nalmost sure I have seen this in print, and quite sure that Dr. Maitland\r\ntold it to me. It is creditable that there was so much freedom; but No. 90\r\nwas _too bad_, and was stopped.\r\n\r\nThe Tractarian mania has now (October 1866) settled down into a chronic\r\nvestment disease, complicated with fits of transubstantiation, which has\r\ntaken the name of {64} _Ritualism_. The common sense of our national\r\ncharacter will not put up with a continuance of this grotesque folly;\r\nmillinery in all its branches will at last be advertised only over the\r\nproper shops. I am told that the Ritualists give short and practical\r\nsermons; if so, they may do good in the end. The English Establishment has\r\nalways contained those who want an excitement; the New Testament, in its\r\nplain meaning, can do little for them. Since the Revolution, Jacobitism,\r\nWesleyanism, Evangelicism, Puseyism,[77] and Ritualism, have come on in\r\nturn, and have furnished hot water for those who could not wash without it.\r\nIf the Ritualists should succeed in substituting short and practical\r\nteaching for the high-spiced lectures of the doctrinalists, they will be\r\nremembered with praise. John the Baptist would perhaps not have brought all\r\nJerusalem out into the wilderness by his plain and good sermons: it was the\r\ncamel's hair and the locusts which got him a congregation, and which,\r\nperhaps, added force to his precepts. When at school I heard a dialogue,\r\nbetween an usher and the man who cleaned the shoes, about Mr. ----, a\r\nminister, a very corporate body with due area of waistcoat. \"He is a man of\r\ngreat erudition,\" said the first. \"Ah, yes sir,\" said Joe; \"any one can see\r\nthat who looks at that silk waistcoat.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THOMAS GEPHYRANDER SALICETUS.\r\n\r\n[When I said at the outset that I had only taken books from my own store, I\r\nshould have added that I did not make any search for information given as\r\n_part_ of a work. Had I looked _through_ all my books, I might have made\r\nsome curious additions. For instance, in Schott's _Magia Naturalis_[78]\r\n{65} (vol. iii. pp. 756-778) is an account of the quadrature of\r\nGephyra_u_der, as he is misprinted in Montucla. He was Thomas Gephyrander\r\nSalicetus; and he published two editions, in 1608 and 1609.[79] I never\r\neven heard of a copy of either. His work is of the extreme of absurdity: he\r\nmakes a distinction between geometrical and arithmetical fractions, and\r\nevolves theorems from it. More curious than his quadrature is his name;\r\nwhat are we to make of it? If a German, he is probably a German form of\r\n_Bridgeman_. and Salicetus refers him to _Weiden_. But _Thomas_ was hardly\r\na German Christian name of his time; of 526 German philosophers,\r\nphysicians, lawyers, and theologians who were biographed by Melchior\r\nAdam,[80] only two are of this name. Of these one is Thomas Erastus,[81]\r\nthe physician whose theological writings against the Church as a separate\r\npower have given the name of Erastians to those who follow his doctrine,\r\nwhether they have heard of him or not. Erastus is little known;\r\naccordingly, some have supposed that he must be Erastus, the friend of St.\r\nPaul and Timothy (Acts xix. 22; 2 Tim. iv. 20; Rom. xvi. 23), but what this\r\ngentleman did to earn the character is not hinted at. Few words would have\r\ndone: Gaius (Rom. xvi. 23) has an immortality which many more noted men\r\nhave missed, given by John Bunyan, out of seven words of St. Paul. I was\r\nonce told that the Erastians got their name from _Blastus_, and I could not\r\nsolve _bl = er_: at last I remembered that Blastus was a _chamberlain_[82]\r\nas well as Erastus; hence the association which {66} caused the mistake.\r\nThe real heresiarch was a physician who died in 1583; his heresy was\r\npromulgated in a work, published immediately after his death by his widow,\r\n_De Excommunicatione Ecclesiastica_. He denied the power of excommunication\r\non the principle above stated; and was answered by Besa.[83] The work was\r\ntranslated by Dr. R. Lee[84] (Edinb. 1844, 8vo). The other is Thomas\r\nGrynaeus,[85] a theologian, nephew of Simon, who first printed Euclid in\r\nGreek; of him Adam says that of works he published none, of learned sons\r\nfour. If Gephyrander were a Frenchman, his name is not so easily guessed\r\nat; but he must have been of La Saussaye. The account given by Schott is\r\ntaken from a certain Father Philip Colbinus, who wrote against him.\r\n\r\nIn some manuscripts lately given to the Royal Society, David Gregory,[86]\r\nwho seems to have seen Gephyrander's work, calls him Salicetus\r\n_Westphalus_, which is probably on the title-page. But the only Weiden I\r\ncan find is in Bavaria. Murhard has both editions in his Catalogue, but had\r\nplainly never seen the books: he gives the author as Thomas Gep. Hyandrus,\r\nSalicettus Westphalus. Murhard is a very old referee of mine; but who the\r\n_non nominandus_ was to see Montucla's _Gephyrander_ in Murhard's _Gep.\r\nHyandrus_, both writers being usually accurate?]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAPIER ON REVELATIONS.\r\n\r\n    A plain discoverie of the whole Revelation of St. John ... whereunto\r\n    are annexed certain oracles of Sibylla.... Set Foorth by John Napeir L.\r\n    of Marchiston. London, 1611, 4to.[87]\r\n\r\n{67}\r\n\r\nThe first edition was Edinburgh, 1593,[88] 4to. Napier[89] always believed\r\nthat his great mission was to upset the Pope, and that logarithms, and such\r\nthings, were merely episodes and relaxations. It is a pity that so many\r\nbooks have been written about this matter, while Napier, as good as any, is\r\nforgotten and unread. He is one of the first who gave us the six thousand\r\nyears. \"There is a sentence of the house of Elias reserved in all ages,\r\nbearing these words: The world shall stand six thousand years, and then it\r\nshall be consumed by fire: two thousand yeares voide or without lawe, two\r\nthousand yeares under the law, and two thousand yeares shall be the daies\r\nof the Messias....\"\r\n\r\nI give Napier's parting salute: it is a killing dilemma:\r\n\r\n\"In summar conclusion, if thou o _Rome_ aledges thyselfe reformed, and to\r\nbeleeue true Christianisme, then beleeue Saint _John_ the Disciple, whome\r\nChrist loued, publikely here in this Reuelation proclaiming thy wracke, but\r\nif thou remain Ethnick in thy priuate thoghts, beleeuing[90] the old\r\nOracles of the _Sibyls_ reuerently keeped somtime in thy _Capitol_: then\r\ndoth here this _Sibyll_ proclame also thy wracke. Repent therefore alwayes,\r\nin this thy latter breath, as thou louest thine Eternall salvation.\r\n_Amen_.\"\r\n\r\n--Strange that Napier should not have seen that this appeal could not\r\nsucceed, unless the prophecies of the Apocalypse were no true prophecies at\r\nall.\r\n\r\n{68}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF GILBERT'S DE MAGNETE.\r\n\r\n    De Magnete magneticisque corporibus, et de magno magnete tellure. By\r\n    William Gilbert. London, 1600, folio.--There is a second edition; and a\r\n    third, according to Watt.[91]\r\n\r\nOf the great work on the magnet there is no need to speak, though it was a\r\nparadox in its day. The posthumous work of Gilbert, \"De Mundo nostro\r\nsublunari philosophia nova\" (Amsterdam, 1651, 4to)[92] is, as the title\r\nindicates, confined to the physics of the globe and its atmosphere. It has\r\nnever excited attention: I should hope it would be examined with our\r\npresent lights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF GIOVANNI BATISTA PORTA.\r\n\r\n    Elementorum Curvilineorium Libri tres. By John Baptista Porta. Rome,\r\n    1610, 4to.[93]\r\n\r\nThis is a ridiculous attempt, which defies description, except that it is\r\nall about lunules. Porta was a voluminous writer. His printer announces\r\nfourteen works printed, and four to come, besides thirteen plays printed,\r\nand eleven waiting. His name is, and will be, current in treatises on\r\nphysics for more reasons than one.\r\n\r\n{69}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCATALDI ON THE QUADRATURE.\r\n\r\n    Trattato della quadratura del cerchio. Di Pietro Antonio Cataldi.\r\n    Bologna, 1612, folio.[94]\r\n\r\nRheticus,[95] Vieta, and Cataldi are the three untiring computers of\r\nGermany, France, and Italy; Napier in Scotland, and Briggs[96] in England,\r\ncome just after them. This work claims a place as beginning with the\r\nquadrature of Pellegrino Borello[97] of Reggio, who will have the circle to\r\nbe exactly 3 diameters and 69/484 of a diameter. Cataldi, taking Van\r\nCeulen's approximation, works hard at the finding of integers which nearly\r\nrepresent the ratio. He had not then the _continued fraction_, a mode of\r\nrepresentation which he gave the next year in his work on the square root.\r\nHe has but twenty of Van Ceulen's thirty places, which he takes from\r\nClavius[98]: and any one might be puzzled to know whence the Italians got\r\nthe result; Van Ceulen, in 1612, not having been translated from Dutch. But\r\nClavius names his comrade Gruenberger, and attributes the approximation to\r\nthem {70} jointly; \"Lud. a Collen et Chr. Gruenbergerus[99] invenerunt,\"\r\nwhich he had no right to do, unless, to his private knowledge, Gruenberger\r\nhad verified Van Ceulen. And Gruenberger only handed over twenty of the\r\nplaces. But here is one instance, out of many, of the polyglot character of\r\nthe Jesuit body, and its advantages in literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF LANSBERGIUS.\r\n\r\n    Philippi Lausbergii Cyclometriae Novae Libri Duo.

By S. C. de V. Paris, 1626,\r\n    8vo (pp. 48).[101]\r\n\r\nIt is written by some Count for his son; and if all the French nobility\r\nwould have given their sons the same kind of instruction about rank, the\r\nold French aristocracy would have been as prosperous at this moment as the\r\nEnglish peerage and squireage. I sent the tract to Capt. Speke,[102]\r\nshortly after his arrival in England, thinking he might like {71} to see\r\nthe old names of the Ethiopian provinces. But I first made a copy of all\r\nthat relates to Prester John,[103] himself a paradox. The tract contains,\r\n_inter alia_, an account of the four empires; of the great Turk, the great\r\nTartar, the great Sophy, and the great Prester John. This word _great_\r\n(_grand_), which was long used in the phrase \"the great Turk,\" is a generic\r\nadjunct to an emperor. Of the Tartars it is said that \"c'est vne nation\r\nprophane et barbaresque, sale et vilaine, qui mangent la chair demie crue,\r\nqui boiuent du laict de jument, et qui n'vsent de nappes et seruiettes que\r\npour essuyer leurs bouches et leurs mains.\"[104] Many persons have heard of\r\nPrester John, and have a very indistinct idea of him. I give all that is\r\nsaid about him, since the recent discussions about the Nile may give an\r\ninterest to the old notions of geography.\r\n\r\n\"Le grand Prestre Jean qui est le quatriesme en rang, est Empereur\r\nd'Ethiopie, et des Abyssins, et se vante d'estre issu de la race de Dauid,\r\ncomme estant descendu de la Royne de Saba, Royne d'Ethiopie, laquelle\r\nestant venue en Hierusalem pour voir la sagesse de Salomon, enuiron l'an du\r\nmonde 2952, s'en retourna grosse d'vn fils qu'ils nomment Moylech, duquel\r\nils disent estre descendus en ligne directe.

R. F. Cyclometricus. Leyden, 1621, 4to.\r\n\r\nThis is a celebrated work on the approximative quadrature, which, having\r\nthe suspicious word _cyclometricus_, must be noticed here for\r\ndistinction.[109]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON BACON'S NOVUM ORGANUM.\r\n\r\n1620. In this year, Francis Bacon[110] published his _Novum Organum_,[111]\r\nwhich was long held in England--but not until the last century--to be the\r\nwork which taught Newton and all his successors how to philosophize. That\r\nNewton never mentions Bacon, nor alludes in any way to his works, passed\r\nfor nothing. Here and there a paradoxer ventured not to find all this\r\nteaching in Bacon, but he was pronounced blind. In our day it begins to be\r\nseen that, great as Bacon was, and great as his book really is, he is not\r\nthe philosophical father of modern discovery.\r\n\r\nBut old prepossession will find reason for anything. A learned friend of\r\nmine wrote to me that he had discovered proof that Newton owned Bacon for\r\nhis master: the proof was that Newton, in some of his earlier writings,\r\nused the {76} phrase _experimentum crucis_, which is Bacon's. Newton may\r\nhave read some of Bacon, though no proof of it appears. I have a dim idea\r\nthat I once saw the two words attributed to the alchemists: if so, there is\r\nanother explanation; for Newton was deeply read in the alchemists.\r\n\r\nI subjoin a review which I wrote of the splendid edition of Bacon by\r\nSpedding,[112] Ellis,[113] and Heath.[114] All the opinions therein\r\nexpressed had been formed by me long before: most of the materials were\r\ncollected for another purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Works of Francis Bacon. Edited by James Spedding, R. Leslie Ellis,\r\n    and Douglas D. Heath. 5 vols.[115]\r\n\r\nNo knowledge of nature without experiment and observation: so said\r\nAristotle, so said Bacon, so acted Copernicus, Tycho Brahe,[116] Gilbert,\r\nKepler, Galileo, Harvey, etc., before Bacon wrote.[117] No derived\r\nknowledge _until_ experiment and observation are concluded: so said Bacon,\r\nand no one else. We do not mean to say that he laid down his principle in\r\nthese words, or that he carried it to the utmost extreme: we mean that\r\nBacon's ruling idea was the {77} collection of enormous masses of facts,\r\nand then digested processes of arrangement and elimination, so artistically\r\ncontrived, that a man of common intelligence, without any unusual sagacity,\r\nshould be able to announce the truth sought for. Let Bacon speak for\r\nhimself, in his editor's English:\r\n\r\n\"But the course I propose for the discovery of sciences is such as leaves\r\nbut little to the acuteness and strength of wits, but places all wits and\r\nunderstandings nearly on a level. For, as in the drawing of a straight line\r\nor a perfect circle, much depends on the steadiness and practice of the\r\nhand, if it be done by aim of hand only, but if with the aid of rule or\r\ncompass little or nothing, so it is exactly with my plan.... For my way of\r\ndiscovering sciences goes far to level men's wits, and leaves but little to\r\nindividual excellence; because it performs everything by the surest rules\r\nand demonstrations.\"\r\n\r\nTo show that we do not strain Bacon's meaning, we add what is said by\r\nHooke,[118] whom we have already mentioned as his professed disciple, and,\r\nwe believe, his only disciple of the day of Newton. We must, however,\r\nremind the reader that Hooke was very little of a mathematician, and spoke\r\nof algebra from his own idea of what others had told him:\r\n\r\n\"The intellect is not to be suffered to act without its helps, but is\r\ncontinually to be assisted by some method or engine, which shall be as a\r\nguide to regulate its actions, so as that it shall not be able to act\r\namiss. Of this engine, no man except the incomparable Verulam hath had any\r\nthoughts and he indeed hath promoted it to a very good pitch; but there is\r\nyet somewhat more to be added, which he seemed to want time to complete. By\r\nthis, as by that {78} art of algebra in geometry, 'twill be very easy to\r\nproceed in any natural inquiry, regularly and certainly.... For as 'tis\r\nvery hard for the most acute wit to find out any difficult problem in\r\ngeometry without the help of algebra ... and altogether as easy for the\r\nmeanest capacity acting by that method to complete and perfect it, so will\r\nit be in the inquiry after natural knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nBacon did not live to mature the whole of this plan. Are we really to\r\nbelieve that if he had completed the _Instauratio_ we who write this--and\r\nwho feel ourselves growing bigger as we write it--should have been on a\r\nlevel with Newton in physical discovery? Bacon asks this belief of us, and\r\ndoes not get it. But it may be said, Your business is with what he _did_\r\nleave, and with its consequences. Be it so. Mr. Ellis says: \"That his\r\nmethod is impracticable cannot, I think, be denied, if we reflect not only\r\nthat it never has produced any result, but also that the process by which\r\nscientific truths have been established cannot be so presented as even to\r\nappear to be in accordance with it.\" That this is very true is well known\r\nto all who have studied the history of discovery: those who deny it are\r\nbound to establish either that some great discovery has been made by\r\nBacon's method--we mean by the part peculiar to Bacon--or, better still, to\r\nshow that some new discovery can be made, by actually making it. No general\r\ntalk about _induction_: no reliance upon the mere fact that certain\r\nexperiments or observations have been made; let us see where _Bacon's\r\ninduction_ has been actually used or can be used. Mere induction,\r\n_enumeratio simplex_, is spoken of by himself with contempt, as utterly\r\nincompetent. For Bacon knew well that a thousand instances may be\r\ncontradicted by the thousand and first: so that no enumeration of\r\ninstances, however large, is \"sure demonstration,\" so long any are left.\r\n\r\nThe immortal Harvey, who was _inventing_--we use the word in its old\r\nsense--the circulation of the blood, while {79} Bacon was in the full flow\r\nof thought upon his system, may be trusted to say whether, when the system\r\nappeared, he found any likeness in it to his own processes, or what would\r\nhave been any help to him, if he had waited for the _Novum Organum_. He\r\nsaid of Bacon, \"He writes philosophy like a Lord Chancellor.\" This has been\r\ngenerally supposed to be only a sneer at the _sutor ultra crepidam_; but we\r\ncannot help suspecting that there was more intended by it. To us, Bacon is\r\neminently the philosopher of _error prevented_, not of _progress\r\nfacilitated_. When we throw off the idea of being _led right_, and betake\r\nourselves to that of being _kept from going wrong_, we read his writings\r\nwith a sense of their usefulness, his genius, and their probable effect\r\nupon purely experimental science, which we can be conscious of upon no\r\nother supposition. It amuses us to have to add that the part of Aristotle's\r\nlogic of which he saw the value was the book on _refutation of fallacies_.\r\nNow is this not the notion of things to which the bias of a practised\r\nlawyer might lead him? In the case which is before the Court, generally\r\nspeaking, truth lurks somewhere about the facts, and the elimination of all\r\nerror will show it in the residuum. The two senses of the word _law_ come\r\nin so as to look almost like a play upon words. The judge can apply the law\r\nso soon as the facts are settled: the physical philosopher has to deduce\r\nthe law from the facts. Wait, says the judge, until the facts are\r\ndetermined: did the prisoner take the goods with felonious intent? did the\r\ndefendant give what amounts to a warranty? or the like. Wait, says Bacon,\r\nuntil all the facts, or all the obtainable facts, are brought in: apply my\r\nrules of separation to the facts, and the result shall come out as easily\r\nas by ruler and compasses. We think it possible that Harvey might allude to\r\nthe legal character of Bacon's notions: we can hardly conceive so acute a\r\nman, after seeing what manner of writer Bacon was, meaning only that he was\r\na lawyer and had better stick to his business. We do ourselves believe that\r\nBacon's philosophy {80} more resembles the action of mind of a common-law\r\njudge--not a Chancellor--than that of the physical inquirers who have been\r\nsupposed to follow in his steps. It seems to us that Bacon's argument is,\r\nthere can be nothing of law but what must be either perceptible, or\r\nmechanically deducible, when all the results of law, as exhibited in\r\nphenomena, are before us. Now the truth is, that the physical philosopher\r\nhas frequently to conceive law which never was in his previous thought--to\r\neduce the unknown, not to choose among the known. Physical discovery would\r\nbe very easy work if the inquirer could lay down his this, his that, and\r\nhis t'other, and say, \"Now, one of these it must be; let us proceed to try\r\nwhich.\" Often has he done this, and failed; often has the truth turned out\r\nto be neither this, that, nor t'other. Bacon seems to us to think that the\r\nphilosopher is a judge who has to choose, upon ascertained facts, which of\r\nknown statutes is to rule the decision: he appears to us more like a person\r\nwho is to write the statute-book, with no guide except the cases and\r\ndecisions presented in all their confusion and all their conflict.\r\n\r\nLet us take the well-known first aphorism of the _Novum Organum_:\r\n\r\n\"Man being the servant and interpreter of nature, can do and understand so\r\nmuch, and so much only, as he has observed in fact or in thought of the\r\ncourse of nature: beyond this he neither knows anything nor can do\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\nThis aphorism is placed by Sir John Herschel[119] at the head of his\r\n_Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy_: a book containing notions\r\nof discovery far beyond any of which Bacon ever dreamed; and this because\r\nit was written {81} after discovery, instead of before. Sir John Herschel,\r\nin his version, has avoided the translation of _re vel mente observaverit_,\r\nand gives us only \"by his observation of the order of nature.\" In making\r\nthis the opening of an excellent sermon, he has imitated the theologians,\r\nwho often employ the whole time of the discourse in stuffing matter into\r\nthe text, instead of drawing matter out of it. By _observation_ he\r\n(Herschel) means the whole course of discovery, observation, hypothesis,\r\ndeduction, comparison, etc. The type of the Baconian philosopher as it\r\nstood in his mind, had been derived from a noble example, his own father,\r\nWilliam Herschel,[120] an inquirer whose processes would have been held by\r\nBacon to have been vague, insufficient, compounded of chance work and\r\nsagacity, and too meagre of facts to deserve the name of induction. In\r\nanother work, his treatise on Astronomy,[121] Sir John Herschel, after\r\nnoting that a popular account can only place the reader on the threshold,\r\nproceeds to speak as follows of all the higher departments of science. The\r\nitalics are his own:\r\n\r\n\"Admission to its sanctuary, and to the privileges and feelings of a\r\nvotary, is only to be gained by one means--_sound and sufficient knowledge\r\nof mathematics, the great instrument of all exact inquiry, without which no\r\nman can ever make such advances in this or any other of the higher\r\ndepartments of science as can entitle him to form an independent opinion on\r\nany subject of discussion within their range_.\"\r\n\r\nHow is this? Man can know no more than he gets from observation, and yet\r\nmathematics is the great instrument of all exact inquiry. Are the results\r\nof mathematical deduction results of observation? We think it likely that\r\n{82} Sir John Herschel would reply that Bacon, in coupling together\r\n_observare re_ and _observare mente_, has done what some wags said Newton\r\nafterwards did in his study-door--cut a large hole of exit for the large\r\ncat, and a little hole for the little cat.[122] But Bacon did no such\r\nthing: he never included any deduction under observation. To mathematics he\r\nhad a dislike. He averred that logic and mathematics should be the\r\nhandmaids, not the mistresses, of philosophy. He meant that they should\r\nplay a subordinate and subsequent part in the dressing of the vast mass of\r\nfacts by which discovery was to be rendered equally accessible to Newton\r\nand to us. Bacon himself was very ignorant of all that had been done by\r\nmathematics; and, strange to say, he especially objected to astronomy being\r\nhanded over to the mathematicians. Leverrier and Adams, calculating an\r\nunknown planet into visible existence by enormous heaps of algebra, furnish\r\nthe last comment of note on this specimen of the goodness of Bacon's views.\r\nThe following account of his knowledge of what had been done in his own day\r\nor before it, is Mr. Spedding's collection of casual remarks in Mr. Ellis's\r\nseveral prefaces:\r\n\r\n\"Though he paid great attention to astronomy, discussed carefully the\r\nmethods in which it ought to be studied, constructed for the satisfaction\r\nof his own mind an elaborate theory of the heavens, and listened eagerly\r\nfor the news from the stars brought by Galileo's telescope, he appears to\r\nhave been utterly ignorant of the discoveries which had just been made by\r\nKepler's calculations. Though he complained in 1623 of the want of\r\ncompendious methods for facilitating arithmetical computations, especially\r\nwith regard to the doctrine of Series, and fully recognized the importance\r\nof them as an aid to physical inquiries--he does not say a word about\r\nNapier's Logarithms, which had been published only nine years before and\r\nreprinted more than once in the {83} interval. He complained that no\r\nconsiderable advance had made in geometry beyond Euclid, without taking any\r\nnotice of what had been done by Archimedes and Apollonius. He saw the\r\nimportance of determining accurately the specific gravity of different\r\nsubstances, and himself attempted to form a table of them by a rude process\r\nof his own, without knowing of the more scientific though still imperfect\r\nmethods previously employed by Archimedes, Ghetaldus,[123] and Porta. He\r\nspeaks of the [Greek: heureka] of Archimedes in a manner which implies that\r\nhe did not clearly apprehend either the nature of the problem to be solved\r\nor the principles upon which the solution depended. In reviewing the\r\nprogress of mechanics, he makes no mention of Archimedes himself, or of\r\nStevinus,[124] Galileo, Guldinus,[125] or Ghetaldus. He makes no allusion\r\nto the theory of equilibrium. He observes that a ball of one pound weight\r\nwill fall nearly as fast through the air as a ball of two, without alluding\r\nto the theory of the acceleration of falling bodies, which had been made\r\nknown by Galileo more than thirty years before. He proposes an inquiry with\r\nregard to the lever--namely, whether in a balance with arms of different\r\nlength but equal weight the distance from the fulcrum has any effect upon\r\nthe inclination,--though the theory of the lever was as well understood in\r\nhis own time as it is now. In making an experiment {84} of his own to\r\nascertain the cause of the motion of a windmill, he overlooks an obvious\r\ncircumstance which makes the experiment inconclusive, and an equally\r\nobvious variation of the same experiment which would have shown him that\r\nhis theory was false. He speaks of the poles of the earth as fixed, in a\r\nmanner which seems to imply that he was not acquainted with the precession\r\nof the equinoxes; and in another place, of the north pole being above and\r\nthe south pole below, as a reason why in our hemisphere the north winds\r\npredominate over the south.\"\r\n\r\nMuch of this was known before, but such a summary of Bacon's want of\r\nknowledge of the science of his own time was never yet collected in one\r\nplace. We may add, that Bacon seems to have been as ignorant of\r\nWright's[126] memorable addition to the resources of navigation as of\r\nNapier's addition to the means of calculation. Mathematics was beginning to\r\nbe the great instrument of exact inquiry: Bacon threw the science aside,\r\nfrom ignorance, just at the time when his enormous sagacity, applied to\r\nknowledge, would have made him see the part it was to play. If Newton had\r\ntaken Bacon for his master, not he, but somebody else, would have been\r\nNewton.[127]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON METEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATORIES.\r\n\r\nThere is an attempt at induction going on, which has yielded little or no\r\nfruit, the observations made in the meteorological observatories. This\r\nattempt is carried on in a manner which would have caused Bacon to dance\r\nfor joy; for he lived in times when Chancellors did dance. {85} Russia,\r\nsays M. Biot,[128] is covered by an army of meteorographs, with generals,\r\nhigh officers, subalterns, and privates with fixed and defined duties of\r\nobservation. Other countries have also their systematic observations. And\r\nwhat has come of it? Nothing, says M. Biot, and nothing will ever come of\r\nit; the veteran mathematician and experimental philosopher declares, as\r\ndoes Mr. Ellis, that no single branch of science has ever been fruitfully\r\nexplored in this way. There is no _special object_, he says. Any one would\r\nsuppose that M. Biot's opinion, given to the French Government upon the\r\nproposal to construct meteorological observatories in Algeria (_Comptes\r\nRendus_, vol. xli, Dec. 31, 1855), was written to support the mythical\r\nBacon, modern physics, against the real Bacon of the _Novum Organum_. There\r\nis no _special object_. In these words lies the difference between the two\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[In the report to the Greenwich Board of Visitors for 1867 Mr. Airy,[129]\r\nspeaking of the increase of meteorological observatories, remarks, \"Whether\r\nthe effect of this movement will be that millions of useless observations\r\nwill be added to the millions that already exist, or whether something may\r\nbe expected to result which will lead to a meteorological theory, I cannot\r\nhazard a conjecture.\" This _is_ a conjecture, and a very obvious one: if\r\nMr. Airy would have given 2-3/4d. for the chance of a meteorological theory\r\nformed by masses of observations, he would never have said what I have\r\nquoted.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBASIS OF MODERN DISCOVERY.\r\n\r\nModern discoveries have not been made by large collections of facts, with\r\nsubsequent discussion, separation, and {86} resulting deduction of a truth\r\nthus rendered perceptible. A few facts have suggested an _hypothesis_,\r\nwhich means a _supposition_, proper to explain them. The necessary results\r\nof this supposition are worked out, and then, and not till then, other\r\nfacts are examined to see if these ulterior results are found in nature.\r\nThe trial of the hypothesis is the _special object_: prior to which,\r\nhypothesis must have been started, not by rule, but by that sagacity of\r\nwhich no description can be given, precisely because the very owners of it\r\ndo not act under laws perceptible to themselves.[130] The inventor of\r\nhypothesis, if pressed to explain his method, must answer as did Zerah\r\nColburn,[131] when asked for his mode of instantaneous calculation. When\r\nthe poor boy had been bothered for some time in this manner, he cried out\r\nin a huff, \"God put it into my head, and I can't put it into yours.\"[132]\r\n{87} Wrong hypotheses, rightly worked from, have produced more useful\r\nresults than unguided observation. But this is not the Baconian plan.\r\nCharles the Second, when informed of the state of navigation, founded a\r\nBaconian observatory at Greenwich, to observe, observe, observe away at the\r\nmoon, until her motions were known sufficiently well to render her useful\r\nin guiding the seaman. And no doubt Flamsteed's[133] observations, twenty\r\nor thirty of them at least, were of signal use. But how? A somewhat\r\nfanciful thinker, one Kepler, had hit upon the approximate orbits of the\r\nplanets by trying one hypothesis after another: he found the _ellipse_,\r\nwhich the Platonists, well despised of Bacon, and who would have despised\r\nhim as heartily if they had known him, had investigated and put ready to\r\nhand nearly 2000 years before.[134] The sun in the focus, the motions of\r\nthe planet more and more rapid as they approach the sun, led Kepler--and\r\nBacon would have reproved him for his rashness--to imagine that a force\r\nresiding in the sun might move the planets, a force inversely as the\r\ndistance. Bouillaud,[135] upon a fanciful analogy, rejected the inverse\r\ndistance, {88} and, rejecting the force altogether, declared that if such a\r\nthing there were, it would be as the inverse _square_ of the distance.\r\nNewton, ready prepared with the mathematics of the subject, tried the fall\r\nof the moon towards the earth, away from her tangent, and found that, as\r\ncompared with the fall of a stone, the law of the inverse square did hold\r\nfor the moon. He deduced the ellipse, he proceeded to deduce the effect of\r\nthe disturbance of the sun upon the moon, upon the assumed theory of\r\n_universal_ gravitation. He found result after result of his theory in\r\nconformity with observed fact: and, by aid of Flamsteed's observations,\r\nwhich amended what mathematicians call his _constants_, he constructed his\r\nlunar theory. Had it not been for Newton, the whole dynasty of Greenwich\r\nastronomers, from Flamsteed of happy memory, to Airy whom Heaven\r\npreserve,[136] might have worked away at nightly observation and daily\r\nreduction, without any remarkable result: looking forward, as to a\r\nmillennium, to the time when any man of moderate intelligence was to see\r\nthe whole explanation. What are large collections of facts for? To make\r\ntheories _from_, says Bacon: to try ready-made theories _by_, says the\r\nhistory of discovery: it's all the same, says the idolater: nonsense, say\r\nwe!\r\n\r\nTime and space run short: how odd it is that of the three leading ideas of\r\nmechanics, time, space, and matter, the first two should always fail a\r\nreviewer before the third. We might dwell upon many points, especially if\r\nwe attempted a more descriptive account of the valuable edition before us.\r\nNo one need imagine that the editors, by their uncompromising attack upon\r\nthe notion of Bacon's influence common even among mathematicians and\r\nexperimental philosophers, have lowered the glory of the great man whom it\r\nwas, many will think, their business to defend through thick and thin. They\r\nhave given a clearer notion of his {89} excellencies, and a better idea of\r\nthe power of his mind, than ever we saw given before. Such a correction as\r\ntheirs must have come, and soon, for as Hallam says--after noting that the\r\n_Novum Organum_ was _never published separately in England_, Bacon has\r\nprobably been more read in the last thirty years--now forty--than in the\r\ntwo hundred years which preceded. He will now be more read than ever he\r\nwas. The history of the intellectual world is the history of the worship of\r\none idol after another. No sooner is it clear that a Hercules has appeared\r\namong men, than all that imagination can conceive of strength is attributed\r\nto him, and his labors are recorded in the heavens. The time arrives when,\r\nas in the case of Aristotle, a new deity is found, and the old one is\r\nconsigned to shame and reproach. A reaction may afterwards take place, and\r\nthis is now happening in the case of the Greek philosopher. The end of the\r\nprocess is, that the opposing deities take their places, side by side, in a\r\nPantheon dedicated not to gods, but to heroes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REAL VALUE OF BACON'S WORKS.\r\n\r\nPassing over the success of Bacon's own endeavors to improve the details of\r\nphysical science, which was next to nothing, and of his method as a whole,\r\nwhich has never been practised, we might say much of the good influence of\r\nhis writings. Sound wisdom, set in sparkling wit, must instruct and amuse\r\nto the end of time: and, as against error, we repeat that Bacon is soundly\r\nwise, so far as he goes. There is hardly a form of human error within his\r\nscope which he did not detect, expose, and attach to a satirical metaphor\r\nwhich never ceases to sting. He is largely indebted to a very extensive\r\nreading; but the thoughts of others fall into his text with such a\r\nclose-fitting compactness that he can make even the words of the Sacred\r\nWriters pass for his own. A saying of the prophet Daniel, rather a\r\nhackneyed quotation in our day, _Multi pertransibunt, et augebitur\r\nscientia_, stands in the title-page of the first edition {90} of Montucla's\r\n_History of Mathematics_ as a quotation from Bacon--and it is not the only\r\nplace in which this mistake occurs. When the truth of the matter, as to\r\nBacon's system, is fully recognized, we have little fear that there will be\r\na reaction against the man. First, because Bacon will always live to speak\r\nfor himself, for he will not cease to be read: secondly, because those who\r\nseek the truth will find it in the best edition of his works, and will be\r\nmost ably led to know what Bacon was, in the very books which first showed\r\nat large what he _was not_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONGREGATION OF THE INDEX, ON COPERNICUS.\r\n\r\nIn this year (1620) appeared the corrections under which the Congregation\r\nof the Index--i.e., the Committee of Cardinals which superintended the\r\n_Index_ of forbidden books--proposed to allow the work of Copernicus to be\r\nread. I insert these conditions in full, because they are often alluded to,\r\nand I know of no source of reference accessible to a twentieth part of\r\nthose who take interest in the question.\r\n\r\nBy a decree of the Congregation of the Index, dated March 5, 1616, the work\r\nof Copernicus, and another of Didacus Astunica,[137] are suspended _donec\r\ncorrigantur_, as teaching:\r\n\r\n\"Falsam illam doctrinam Pythagoricam, divinae que Scripturae omnino\r\nadversantem, de mobilitate Terrae et immobilitate Solis.\"[138]\r\n\r\nBut a work of the Carmelite Foscarini[139] is:\r\n\r\n{91}\r\n\r\n\"Omnino prohibendum atque damnandum,\" because \"ostendere conatur praefatam\r\ndoctrinam ... consonam esse veritati et non adversari Sacrae\r\nScripturae.\"[140]\r\n\r\nWorks which teach the false doctrine of the earth's motion are to be\r\ncorrected; those which declare the doctrine conformable to Scripture are to\r\nbe utterly prohibited.\r\n\r\nIn a \"Monitum ad Nicolai Copernici lectorem, ejusque emendatio, permissio,\r\net correctio,\" dated 1620 without the month or day, permission is given to\r\nreprint the work of Copernicus with certain alterations; and, by\r\nimplication, to read existing copies after correction in writing. In the\r\npreamble the author is called _nobilis astrologus_; not a compliment to his\r\nbirth, which was humble, but to his fame. The suspension was because:\r\n\r\n\"Sacrae Scripturae, ejusque verae et Catholicae interpretationi repugnantia\r\n(quod in homine Christiano minime tolerandum) non _per hypothesin_\r\ntractare, sed _ut verissima_ adstruere non dubitat!\"[141]\r\n\r\nAnd the corrections relate:\r\n\r\n\"Locis in quibus non _ex hypothesi_, sed _asserendo_ de situ et motu Terrae\r\ndisputat.\"[142]\r\n\r\nThat is, the earth's motion may be an hypothesis for elucidation of the\r\nheavenly motions, but must not be asserted as a fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(In Pref. circa finem.) \"_Copernicus._ Si fortasse erunt [Greek:\r\nmataiologoi], qui cum omnium Mathematum ignari sint, tamen de illis\r\njudicium sibi summunt, propter aliquem locum scripturae, male ad suum\r\npropositum detortum, ausi fuerint meum {92} hoc institutum reprehendere ac\r\ninsectari: illos nihil moror adeo ut etiam illorum judicium tanquam\r\ntemerarium contemnam. Non enim obscurum est Lactantium, celebrem alioqui\r\nscriptorem, sed Mathematicum parum, admodum pueriliter de forma terrae\r\nloqui, cum deridet eos, qui terram globi formam habere prodiderunt. Itaque\r\nnon debet mirum videri studiosis, si qui tales nos etiam videbunt.\r\nMathemata Mathematicis scribuntur, quibus et hi nostri labores, si me non\r\nfallit opinio, videbuntur etiam Reipub. ecclesiasticae conducere aliquid....\r\n_Emend._ Ibi _si fortasse_ dele omnia, usque ad verbum _hi nostri labores_\r\net sic accommoda--_Coeterum hi nostri labores_.\"[143]\r\n\r\nAll the allusion to Lactantius, who laughed at the notion of the earth\r\nbeing round, which was afterwards found true, is to be struck out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Cap. 5. lib. i. p. 3) \"_Copernicus._ Si tamen attentius rem consideremus,\r\nvidebitur haec quaestio nondum absoluta, et ideireo minime contemnenda.\r\n_Emend._ Si tamen attentius rem consideremus, nihil refert an Terram in\r\nmedio Mundi, an extra Medium existere, quoad solvendas coelestium motuum\r\napparentias existimemus.\"[144]\r\n\r\n{93}\r\n\r\nWe must not say the question is not yet settled, but only that it may be\r\nsettled either way, so far as mere explanation of the celestial motions is\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Cap. 8. lib. i.) \"Totum hoc caput potest expungi, quia ex professo tractat\r\nde veritate motus Terrae, dum solvit veterum rationes probantes ejus\r\nquietem. Cum tamen problematice videatur loqui; ut studiosis satisfiat,\r\nseriesque et ordo libri integer maneat; emendetur ut infra.\"[145]\r\n\r\nA chapter which seems to assert the motion should perhaps be expunged; but\r\nit may perhaps be problematical; and, not to break up the book, must be\r\namended as below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(p. 6.) \"_Copernicus._ Cur ergo hesitamus adhuc, mobilitatem illi formae suae\r\na natura congruentem concedere, magisquam quod totus labatur mundus, cujus\r\nfinis ignoratur, scirique nequit, neque fateamur ipsius cotidianae\r\nrevolutionis in coelo apparentiam esse, et in terra veritatem? Et haec\r\nperinde se habere, ac si diceret Virgilianus AEneas: Provehimur portu ...\r\n_Emend._ Cur ergo non possum mobilitatem illi formae suae concedere, magisque\r\nquod totus labatur mundus, cujus finis ignoratur scirique nequit, et quae\r\napparent in coelo, perinde se habere ac si ...\"[146]\r\n\r\n{94}\r\n\r\n\"Why should we hesitate to allow the earth's motion,\" must be altered into\r\n\"I cannot concede the earth's motion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(p. 7.) \"_Copernicus._ Addo etiam, quod satis absurdum videretur,\r\ncontinenti sive locanti motum adscribi, et non potius contento et locato,\r\nquod est terra. _Emend._ Addo etiam difficilius non esse contento et\r\nlocato, quod est Terra, motum adscribere, quam continenti.\"[147]\r\n\r\nWe must not say it is absurd to refuse motion to the _contained_ and\r\n_located_, and to give it to the containing and locating; say that neither\r\nis more difficult than the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(p. 7.) \"_Copernicus._ Vides ergo quod ex his omnibus probabilior sit\r\nmobilitas Terrae, quam ejus quies, praesertim in cotidiana revolutione,\r\ntanquam terrae maxime propria. _Emend._ _Vides_ ... delendus est usque ad\r\nfinem capitis.\"[148]\r\n\r\nStrike out the whole of the chapter from this to the end; it says that the\r\nmotion of the earth is the most probable hypothesis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Cap. 9. lib. i. p. 7.) \"_Copernicus._ Cum igitur nihil prohibeat\r\nmobilitatem Terrae, videndum nunc arbitror, an etiam plures illi motus\r\nconveniant, ut possit una errantium syderum existimari. _Emend._ Cum igitur\r\nTerram moveri assumpserim, videndum nunc arbitror, an etiam illi plures\r\npossint convenire motus.\"[149]\r\n\r\n{95}\r\n\r\nWe must not say that nothing prohibits the motion of the earth, only that\r\nhaving _assumed_ it, we may inquire whether our explanations require\r\nseveral motions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Cap. 10. lib. i. p. 9.) \"_Copernicus._ Non pudet nos fateri ... hoc potius\r\nin mobilitate terrae verificari. _Emend._ Non pudet nos assumere ... hoc\r\nconsequenter in mobilitate verificari.\"[150]\r\n\r\n(Cap. 10. lib. i. p. 10.) \"_Copernicus._ Tanta nimirum est divina haec. Opt.\r\nMax. fabrica. _Emend._ Dele illa verba postrema.\"[151]\r\n\r\n(Cap. ii. lib. i.[152]) \"_Copernicus._ De triplici motu telluris\r\ndemonstratio. _Emend._ De hypothesi triplicis motus Terrae, ejusque\r\ndemonstratione.\"[153]\r\n\r\n(Cap. 10. lib. iv. p. 122.[154]) \"_Copernicus._ De magnitudine horum trium\r\nsiderum, Solis, Lunae, et Terrae. _Emend._ Dele verba _horum trium siderum_,\r\nquia terra non est sidus, ut facit eam Copernicus.\"[155]\r\n\r\nWe must not say we are not ashamed to _acknowledge_; _assume_ is the word.\r\nWe must not call this assumption a _Divine work_. A chapter must not be\r\nheaded _demonstration_, but _hypothesis_. The earth must not be called a\r\n_star_; the word implies motion.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that it does not take much to reduce Copernicus to pure\r\nhypothesis. No personal injury being done to the author--who indeed had\r\nbeen 17 years out of {96} reach--the treatment of his book is now an\r\nexcellent joke. It is obvious that the Cardinals of the Index were a little\r\nashamed of their position, and made a mere excuse of a few corrections.\r\nTheir mode of dealing with chap. 8, this _problematice videtur loqui, ut\r\nstudiosis satisfiat_,[156] is an excuse to avoid corrections. But they\r\nstruck out the stinging allusion to Lactantius[157] in the preface, little\r\nthinking, honest men, for they really believed what they said--that the\r\nlight of Lactantius would grow dark before the brightness of their own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONVOCATION AT OXFORD EQUALLY AT FAULT.\r\n\r\n1622. I make no reference to the case of Galileo, except this. I have\r\npointed out (_Penny Cycl. Suppl._ \"Galileo\"; _Engl. Cycl._ \"Motion of the\r\nEarth\") that it is clear the absurdity was the act of the _Italian_\r\nInquisition--for the private and personal pleasure of the Pope, who _knew_\r\nthat the course he took would not commit him as _Pope_--and not of the body\r\nwhich calls itself the _Church_. Let the dirty proceeding have its right\r\nname. The Jesuit Riccioli,[158] the stoutest and most learned\r\nAnti-Copernican in Europe, and the Puritan Wilkins, a strong Copernican and\r\nPope-hater, are equally positive that the Roman _Church_ never pronounced\r\nany decision: and this in the time immediately following the ridiculous\r\nproceeding of the Inquisition. In like manner a decision of the Convocation\r\nof Oxford is not a law of the _English_ Church; which is fortunate, for\r\nthat Convocation, in 1622, came to a decision quite as absurd, and a great\r\ndeal {97} more wicked than the declaration against the motion of the earth.\r\nThe second was a foolish mistake; the first was a disgusting surrender of\r\nright feeling. The story is told without disapprobation by Anthony Wood,\r\nwho never exaggerated anything against the university of which he is\r\nwriting eulogistic history.\r\n\r\nIn 1622, one William Knight[159] put forward in a sermon preached before\r\nthe University certain theses which, looking at the state of the times, may\r\nhave been improper and possibly of seditious intent. One of them was that\r\nthe bishop might excommunicate the civil magistrate: this proposition the\r\nclerical body could not approve, and designated it by the term\r\n_erronea_,[160] the mildest going. But Knight also declared as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Subditis mere privatis, si Tyrannus tanquam latro aut stuprator in ipsos\r\nfaciat impetum, et ipsi nec potestatem ordinariam implorare, nec alia\r\nratione effugere periculum possint, in presenti periculo se et suos contra\r\ntyrannum, sicut contra privatum grassatorem, defendere licet.\"[161]\r\n\r\nThat is, a man may defend his purse or a woman her honor, against the\r\npersonal attack of a king, as against that of a private person, if no other\r\nmeans of safety can be found. The Convocation sent Knight to prison,\r\ndeclared the proposition _\"falsa_, periculosa, et _impia_,\" and enacted\r\nthat all applicants for degrees should subscribe this censure, and make\r\noath that they would neither hold, teach, nor defend Knight's opinions.\r\n\r\nThe thesis, in the form given, was unnecessary and improper. Though strong\r\nopinions of the king's rights were advanced at the time, yet no one\r\nventured to say that, {98} ministers and advisers apart, the king might\r\n_personally_ break the law; and we know that the first and only attempt\r\nwhich his successor made brought on the crisis which cost him his throne\r\nand his head. But the declaration that the proposition was _false_ far\r\nexceeds in all that is disreputable the decision of the Inquisition against\r\nthe earth's motion. We do not mention this little matter in England. Knight\r\nwas a Puritan, and Neal[162] gives a short account of his sermon. From\r\ncomparison with Wood,[163] I judge that the theses, as given, were not\r\nKnight's words, but the digest which it was customary to make in criminal\r\nproceedings against opinion. This heightens the joke, for it appears that\r\nthe qualifiers of the Convocation took pains to present their condemnation\r\nof Knight in the terms which would most unequivocally make their censure\r\ncondemn themselves. This proceeding took place in the interval between the\r\ntwo proceedings against Galileo: it is left undetermined whether we must\r\nsay pot-kettle-pot or kettle-pot-kettle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Liberti Fromondi.... Ant-Aristarchus, sive orbis terrae immobilis.\r\n    Antwerp, 1631, 8vo.[164]\r\n\r\nThis book contains the evidence of an ardent opponent of Galileo to the\r\nfact, that Roman Catholics of the day did not consider the decree of the\r\n_Index_ or of the _Inquisition_ as a declaration of their _Church_. Fromond\r\nwould have been glad to say as much, and tries to come near it, but\r\nconfesses he must abstain. See _Penny Cyclop. Suppl._ \"Galileo,\" and _Eng.\r\nCycl._ \"Motion of the Earth.\" The author of a celebrated article in the\r\n_Dublin Review_, in defence of the {99} Church of Rome, seeing that\r\nDrinkwater Bethune[165] makes use of the authority of Fromondus, but for\r\nanother purpose, sneers at him for bringing up a \"musty old Professor.\" If\r\nhe had known Fromondus, and used him he would have helped his own case,\r\nwhich is very meagre for want of knowledge.[166]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Advis a Monseigneur l'eminentissime Cardinal Duc de Richelieu, sur la\r\n    Proposition faicte par le Sieur Morin pour l'invention des longitudes.\r\n    Paris, 1634, 8vo.[167]\r\n\r\nThis is the Official Report of the Commissioners appointed by the Cardinal,\r\nof whom Pascal is the one now best known, to consider Morin's plan.

Leyden, 1640,\r\n    4to.[168]\r\n\r\nThis book contains the celebrated approximation _guessed at_ by his father,\r\nPeter Metius,[169] namely that the diameter is {100} to the circumference\r\nas 113 to 355. The error is at the rate of about a foot in 2,000 miles.\r\nPeter Metius, having his attention called to the subject by the false\r\nquadrature of Duchesne, found that the ratio lay between 333/106 and\r\n377/120. He then took the liberty of taking the mean of both numerators and\r\ndenominators, giving 355/113. He had no right to presume that this mean was\r\nbetter than either of the extremes; nor does it appear positively that he\r\ndid so. He published nothing; but his son Adrian,[170] when Van Ceulen's\r\nwork showed how near his father's result came to the truth, first made it\r\nknown in the work above. (See _Eng. Cyclop._, art. \"Quadrature.\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON INHABITABLE PLANETS.\r\n\r\n    A discourse concerning a new world and another planet, in two books.\r\n    London, 1640, 8vo.[171]\r\n\r\n    Cosmotheoros: or conjectures concerning the planetary worlds and their\r\n    inhabitants. Written in Latin, by Christianus Huyghens. This\r\n    translation was first published in 1698. Glasgow, 1757, 8vo. [The\r\n    original is also of 1698.][172]\r\n\r\nThe first work is by Bishop Wilkins, being the third edition, [first in\r\n1638] of the first book, \"That the Moon may be a Planet\"; and the first\r\nedition of the second work, {101} \"That the Earth may be a Planet.\" [See\r\nmore under the reprint of 1802.] Whether other planets be inhabited or not,\r\nthat is, crowded with organisations some of them having consciousness, is\r\nnot for me to decide; but I should be much surprised if, on going to one of\r\nthem, I should find it otherwise. The whole dispute tacitly assumes that,\r\nif the stars and planets be inhabited, it must be by things of which we can\r\nform some idea. But for aught we know, what number of such bodies there\r\nare, so many organisms may there be, of which we have no way of thinking\r\nnor of speaking. This is seldom remembered. In like manner it is usually\r\nforgotten that the _matter_ of other planets may be of different chemistry\r\nfrom ours. There may be no oxygen and hydrogen in Jupiter, which may have\r\n_gens_ of its own.[173] But this must not be said: it would limit the\r\nomniscience of the _a priori_ school of physical inquirers, the larger half\r\nof the whole, and would be very _unphilosophical_. Nine-tenths of my best\r\nparadoxers come out from among this larger half, because they are just a\r\nlittle more than of it at their entrance.\r\n\r\nThere was a discussion on the subject some years ago, which began with\r\n\r\n    The plurality of worlds: an Essay. London, 1853, 8vo. [By Dr. Wm.\r\n    Whewell, Master of Trinity College, Cambridge]. A dialogue on the\r\n    plurality of worlds, being a supplement to the Essay on that subject.\r\n    [First found in the second edition, 1854; removed to the end in\r\n    subsequent editions, and separate copies issued.][174]\r\n\r\nA work of skeptical character, insisting on analogies which prohibit the\r\npositive conclusion that the planets, stars, etc., are what we should call\r\n_inhabited_ worlds. It produced {102} several works and a large amount of\r\ncontroversy in reviews. The last predecessor of whom I know was\r\n\r\n    Plurality of Worlds.... By Alexander Maxwell. Second Edition. London,\r\n    1820, 8vo.\r\n\r\nThis work is directed against the plurality by an author who does not admit\r\nmodern astronomy. It was occasioned by Dr. Chalmers's[175] celebrated\r\ndiscourses on religion in connection with astronomy. The notes contain many\r\ncitations on the gravity controversy, from authors now very little read:\r\nand this is its present value. I find no mention of Maxwell, not even in\r\nWatt.[176] He communicated with mankind without the medium of a publisher;\r\nand, from Vieta till now, this method has always been favorable to loss of\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nA correspondent informs me that Alex. Maxwell, who wrote on the plurality\r\nof worlds, in 1820, was a law-bookseller and publisher (probably his own\r\npublisher) in Bell Yard. He had peculiar notions, which he was fond of\r\ndiscussing with his customers. He was a bit of a Swedenborgian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINHABITED PLANETS IN FICTION.\r\n\r\nThere is a class of hypothetical creations which do not belong to my\r\nsubject, because they are _acknowledged_ to be fictions, as those of\r\nLucian,[177] Rabelais,[178] Swift, Francis {103} Godwin,[179] Voltaire,\r\netc. All who have more positive notions as to either the composition or\r\norganization of other worlds, than the reasonable conclusion that our\r\nArchitect must be quite able to construct millions of other buildings on\r\nmillions of other plans, ought to rank with the writers just mentioned, in\r\nall but self-knowledge. Of every one of their systems I say, as the Irish\r\nBishop said of Gulliver's book,--I don't believe half of it. Huyghens had\r\nbeen preceded by Fontenelle,[180] who attracted more attention. Huyghens is\r\nvery fanciful and very positive; but he gives a true account of his method.\r\n\"But since there's no hopes of a Mercury to carry us such a journey, we\r\nshall e'en be contented with what's in our power: we shall suppose\r\nourselves there....\" And yet he says, \"We have proved that they live in\r\nsocieties, have hands and feet....\" Kircher[181] had gone to the stars\r\nbefore him, but would not find any life in them, either animal or\r\nvegetable.\r\n\r\nThe question of the inhabitants of a particular planet is one which has\r\ntruth on one side or the other: either there are some inhabitants, or there\r\nare none. Fortunately, it is of no consequence which is true. But there are\r\nmany cases where the balance is equally one of truth and falsehood, in\r\nwhich the choice is a matter of importance. My work selects, for the most\r\npart, sins against demonstration: but the world is full of questions of\r\nfact or opinion, in which a struggling minority will become a majority, or\r\nelse will {104} be gradually annihilated: and each of the cases subdivides\r\ninto results of good, and results of evil. What is to be done?\r\n\r\n \"Periculosum est credere et non credere;\r\n  Hippolitus obiit quia novercae creditum est;\r\n  Cassandrae quia non creditum ruit Ilium:\r\n  Ergo exploranda est veritas multum prius\r\n  Quam stulta prove judicet sententia.\"[182]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Nova Demonstratio immobilitatis terrae petita ex virtute magnetica. By\r\n    Jacobus Grandamicus. Flexiae (La Fleche), 1645, 4to.[183]\r\n\r\nNo magnetic body can move about its poles: the earth is a magnetic body,\r\ntherefore, etc. The iron and its magnetism are typical of two natures in\r\none person; so it is said, \"Si exaltatus fuero a terra, omnia traham ad me\r\nipsum.\"[184]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA VENETIAN BUDGET OF PARADOXES.\r\n\r\n    Le glorie degli incogniti, o vero gli huomini illustri dell' accademia\r\n    de' signori incogniti di Venetia. Venice, 1647, 4to.\r\n\r\nThis work is somewhat like a part of my own: it is a budget of Venetian\r\nnobodies who wished to be somebodies; but paradox is not the only means\r\nemployed. It is of a serio-comic character, gives genuine portraits in\r\ncopperplate, and grave lists of works; but satirical accounts. The\r\nastrologer Andrew Argoli[185] is there, and his son; both of whom, with\r\nsome of the others, have place in modern works {105} on biography. Argoli's\r\ndiscovery that logarithms facilitate easy processes, but increase the labor\r\nof difficult ones, is worth recording.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Controversiae de vera circuli mensura ... inter ... C. S. Longomontanum\r\n    et Jo. Pellium.[186] Amsterdam, 1647, 4to.\r\n\r\nLongomontanus,[187] a Danish astronomer of merit, squared the circle in\r\n1644: he found out that the diameter 43 gives the square root of 18252 for\r\nthe circumference; which gives 3.14185... for the ratio. Pell answered him,\r\nand being a kind of circulating medium, managed to engage in the\r\ncontroversy names known and unknown, as Roberval, Hobbes, Carcavi, Lord\r\nCharles Cavendish, Pallieur, Mersenne, Tassius, Baron Wolzogen, Descartes,\r\nCavalieri and Golius.[188] Among them, of course, Longomontanus was made\r\n{106} mincemeat: but he is said to have insisted on the discovery of his\r\nepitaph.[189]\r\n\r\n{107}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CIRCULATING MEDIA OF MATHEMATICS.\r\n\r\nThe great circulating mediums, who wrote to everybody, heard from\r\neverybody, and sent extracts to everybody else, have been Father Mersenne,\r\nJohn Collins, and the late Professor Schumacher: all \"late\" no doubt, but\r\nonly the last recent enough to be so styled. If M.C.S. should ever again\r\nstand for \"Member of the Corresponding Society,\" it should raise an\r\nacrostic thought of the three. There is an allusion to Mersenne's\r\noccupation in Hobbes's reply to him. He wanted to give Hobbes, who was very\r\nill at Paris, the Roman Eucharist: but Hobbes said, \"I have settled all\r\nthat long ago; when did you hear from Gassendi?\" We are reminded of\r\nWilliam's answer to Burnet. John Collins disseminated Newton, among others.\r\nSchumacher ought to have been called the postmaster-general of astronomy,\r\nas Collins was called the attorney-general of mathematics.[190]\r\n\r\n{108}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SYMPATHETIC POWDER.\r\n\r\n    A late discourse ... by Sir Kenelme Digby.... Rendered into English by\r\n    R. White. London, 1658, 12mo.\r\n\r\nOn this work see _Notes and Queries_, 2d series, vii. 231, 299, 445, viii.\r\n190. It contains the celebrated sympathetic powder. I am still in much\r\ndoubt as to the connection of Digby with this tract.[191] Without entering\r\non the subject here, I observe that in Birch's _History of the Royal\r\nSociety_,[192] to which both Digby and White belonged, Digby, though he\r\nbrought many things before the Society, never mentioned the powder, which\r\nis connected only with the names of Evelyn[193] and Sir Gilbert\r\nTalbot.[194] The sympathetic powder was that which cured by anointing the\r\nweapon with its salve instead of the wound. I have long been convinced that\r\nit was efficacious. The directions were to keep the {109} wound clean and\r\ncool, and to take care of diet, rubbing the salve on the knife or\r\nsword.[195] If we remember the dreadful notions upon drugs which prevailed,\r\nboth as to quantity and quality, we shall readily see that any way of _not_\r\ndressing the wound would have been useful. If the physicians had taken the\r\nhint, had been careful of diet etc., and had poured the little barrels of\r\nmedicine down the throat of a practicable doll, _they_ would have had their\r\nmagical cures as well as the surgeons.[196] Matters are much improved now;\r\nthe quantity of medicine given, even by orthodox physicians, would have\r\nbeen called infinitesimal by their professional ancestors. Accordingly, the\r\nCollege of Physicians has a right to abandon its motto, which is _Ars\r\nlonga, vita brevis_, meaning _Practice is long, so life is short_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOBBES AS A MATHEMATICIAN.\r\n\r\n    Examinatio et emendatio Mathematicae Hodiernae. By Thomas Hobbes. London,\r\n    1666, 4to.\r\n\r\nIn six dialogues: the sixth contains a quadrature of the circle.[197] But\r\nthere is another edition of this work, without place or date on the\r\ntitle-page, in which the quadrature is omitted. This seems to be connected\r\nwith the publication {110} of another quadrature, without date, but about\r\n1670, as may be judged from its professing to answer a tract of Wallis,\r\nprinted in 1669.[198] The title is \"Quadratura circuli, cubatio sphaerae,\r\nduplicatio cubi,\" 4to.[199] Hobbes, who began in 1655, was very wrong in\r\nhis quadrature; but, though not a Gregory St. Vincent,[200] he was not the\r\nignoramus in geometry that he is sometimes supposed. His writings,\r\nerroneous as they are in many things, contain acute remarks on points of\r\nprinciple. He is wronged by being coupled with Joseph Scaliger, as the two\r\ngreat instances of men of letters who have come into geometry to help the\r\nmathematicians out of their difficulty. I have never seen Scaliger's\r\nquadrature,[201] except in the answers of Adrianus Romanus,[202] Vieta and\r\nClavius, and in the extracts of Kastner.[203] Scaliger had no right to such\r\nstrong opponents: Erasmus or Bentley might just as well have tried the\r\nproblem, and either would have done much better in any twenty minutes of\r\nhis life.[204]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ESTIMATE OF SCALIGER.\r\n\r\nScaliger inspired some mathematicians with great respect for his\r\ngeometrical knowledge. Vieta, the first man of his time, who answered him,\r\nhad such regard for his opponent {111} as made him conceal Scaliger's name.\r\nNot that he is very respectful in his manner of proceeding: the following\r\ndry quiz on his opponent's logic must have been very cutting, being true.\r\n\"In grammaticis, dare navibus Austros, et dare naves Austris, sunt aeque\r\nsignificantia. Sed in Geometricis, aliud est adsumpsisse circulum BCD non\r\nesse majorem triginta sex segmentis BCDF, aliud circulo BCD non esse majora\r\ntriginta sex segmenta BCDF. Illa adsumptiuncula vera est, haec falsa.\"[205]\r\nIsaac Casaubon,[206] in one of his letters to De Thou,[207] relates that,\r\nhe and another paying a visit to Vieta, the conversation fell upon\r\nScaliger, of whom the host said that he believed Scaliger was the only man\r\nwho perfectly understood mathematical writers, especially the Greek ones:\r\nand that he thought more of Scaliger when wrong than of many others when\r\nright; \"pluris se Scaligerum vel errantem facere quam multos [Greek:\r\nkatorthountas].\"[208] This must have been before Scaliger's quadrature\r\n(1594). There is an old story of some one saying, \"Mallem cum Scaligero\r\nerrare, quam cum Clavio recte sapere.\"[209] This I cannot help suspecting\r\nto have been a version of Vieta's speech with Clavius satirically inserted,\r\non account of the great hostility which Vieta showed towards Clavius in the\r\nlatter years of his life.\r\n\r\nMontucla could not have read with care either Scaliger's quadrature or\r\nClavius's refutation. He gives the first a wrong date: he assures the world\r\nthat there is no question about Scaliger's quadrature being wrong, in the\r\neyes of geometers at least: and he states that Clavius mortified him {112}\r\nextremely by showing that it made the circle less than its inscribed\r\ndodecagon, which is, of course, equivalent to asserting that a straight\r\nline is not always the shortest distance between two points. Did _Clavius_\r\nshow this? No, it was Scaliger himself who showed it, boasted of it, and\r\ndeclared it to be a \"noble paradox\" that a theorem false in geometry is\r\ntrue in arithmetic; a thing, he says with great triumph, not noticed by\r\nArchimedes himself! He says in so many words that the periphery of the\r\ndodecagon is greater than that of the circle; and that the more sides there\r\nare to the inscribed figure, the more does it exceed the circle in which it\r\nis. And here _are_ the words, on the independent testimonies of Clavius and\r\nKastner:\r\n\r\n\"Ambitus dodecagoni circulo inscribendi plus potest quam circuli ambitus.\r\nEt quanto deinceps plurium laterum fuerit polygonum circulo inscribendum,\r\ntanto plus poterit ambitus polygoni quam ambitus circuli.\"[210]\r\n\r\nThere is much resemblance between Joseph Scaliger and William\r\nHamilton,[211] in a certain impetuousity of character, and inaptitude to\r\nthink of quantity. Scaliger maintained that the arc of a circle is less\r\nthan its chord in arithmetic, though greater in geometry; Hamilton arrived\r\nat two quantities which are identical, but the greater the one the less the\r\nother. But, on the whole, I liken Hamilton rather to Julius than to Joseph.\r\nOn this last hero of literature I repeat Thomas Edwards,[212] who says that\r\na man is unlearned who, be his other knowledge what it may, does not {113}\r\nunderstand the subject he writes about. And now one of many instances in\r\nwhich literature gives to literature character in science. Anthony\r\nTeissier,[213] the learned annotator of De Thou's biographies, says of\r\nFinaeus, \"Il se vanta sans raison avoir trouve la quadrature du cercle; la\r\ngloire de cette admirable decouverte etait reservee a Joseph Scalinger,\r\ncomme l'a ecrit Scevole de St. Marthe.\"[214]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN GRAUNT AS A PARADOXER.\r\n\r\n    Natural and Political Observations ... upon the Bills of Mortality. By\r\n    John Graunt, citizen of London. London, 1662, 4to.[215]\r\n\r\nThis is a celebrated book, the first great work upon mortality. But the\r\nauthor, going _ultra crepidam_, has attributed to the motion of the moon in\r\nher orbit all the tremors which she gets from a shaky telescope.[216] But\r\nthere is another paradox about this book: the above absurd opinion is\r\nattributed to that excellent mechanist, Sir William Petty, who passed his\r\ndays among the astronomers. Graunt did not write his own book! Anthony\r\nWood[217] hints that Petty \"assisted, or put into a way\" his old\r\nbenefactor: no doubt the two friends talked the matter over many a time.\r\nBurnet and Pepys[218] state that Petty wrote the book. It is enough for me\r\nthat {114} Graunt, whose honesty was never impeached, uses the plainest\r\nincidental professions of authorship throughout; that he was elected into\r\nthe Royal Society because he was the author; that Petty refers to him as\r\nauthor in scores of places, and published an edition, as editor, after\r\nGraunt's death, with Graunt's name of course. The note on Graunt in the\r\n_Biographia Britannica_ may be consulted; it seems to me decisive. Mr.\r\nC. B. Hodge, an able actuary, has done the best that can be done on the\r\nother side in the _Assurance Magazine_, viii. 234. If I may say what is in\r\nmy mind, without imputation of disrespect, I suspect some actuaries have a\r\nbias: they would rather have Petty the greater for their Coryphaeus than\r\nGraunt the less.[219]\r\n\r\nPepys is an ordinary gossip: but Burnet's account has an animus which is of\r\na worse kind. He talks of \"one Graunt, a Papist, under whose name Sir\r\nWilliam Petty[220] published his observations on the bills of mortality.\"\r\nHe then gives the cock without a bull story of Graunt being a trustee of\r\nthe New River Company, and shutting up the cocks and carrying off their\r\nkeys, just before the fire of London, by which a supply of water was\r\ndelayed.[221] It was one of the first objections made to Burnet's work,\r\nthat Graunt was _not_ a trustee at the time; and Maitland, the historian of\r\nLondon, ascertained from the books of the Company that he was not admitted\r\nuntil twenty-three days after the breaking out of the fire. Graunt's first\r\nadmission {115} to the Company took place on the very day on which a\r\ncommittee was appointed to inquire into the cause of the fire. So much for\r\nBurnet. I incline to the view that Graunt's setting London on fire strongly\r\ncorroborates his having written on the bills of mortality: every practical\r\nman takes stock before he commences a grand operation in business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMANKIND A GULLIBLE LOT.\r\n\r\n    De Cometis: or a discourse of the natures and effects of Comets, as\r\n    they are philosophically, historically, and astrologically considered.\r\n    With a brief (yet full) account of the III late Comets, or blazing\r\n    stars, visible to all Europe. And what (in a natural way of judicature)\r\n    they portend. Together with some observations on the nativity of the\r\n    Grand Seignior. By John Gadbury, [Greek: Philomathematikos]. London,\r\n    1665, 4to.\r\n\r\nGadbury, though his name descends only in astrology, was a well-informed\r\nastronomer.[222] D'Israeli[223] sets down Gadbury, Lilly, Wharton, Booker,\r\netc., as rank rogues: I think him quite wrong. The easy belief in roguery\r\nand intentional imposture which prevails in educated society is, to my\r\nmind, a greater presumption against the honesty of mankind than all the\r\nroguery and imposture itself. Putting aside mere swindling for the sake of\r\ngain, and looking at speculation and paradox, I find very little reason to\r\nsuspect wilful deceit.[224] My opinion of mankind is founded upon the {116}\r\nmournful fact that, so far as I can see, they find within themselves the\r\nmeans of believing in a thousand times as much as there is to believe in,\r\njudging by experience. I do not say anything against Isaac D'Israeli for\r\ntalking his time. We are all in the team, and we all go the road, but we do\r\nnot all draw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FORERUNNER OF A WRITTEN ESPERANTO.\r\n\r\n    An essay towards a real character and a philosophical language. By John\r\n    Wilkins [Dean of Ripon, afterwards Bishop of Chester].[225] London,\r\n    1668, folio.\r\n\r\nThis work is celebrated, but little known. Its object gives it a right to a\r\nplace among paradoxes. It proposes a language--if that be the proper\r\nname--in which _things_ and their relations shall be denoted by signs, not\r\n_words_: so that any person, whatever may be his mother tongue, may read it\r\nin his own words. This is an obvious possibility, and, I am afraid, an\r\nobvious impracticability. One man may construct such a system--Bishop\r\nWilkins has done it--but where is the man who will learn it? The second\r\ntongue makes a language, as the second blow makes a fray. There has been\r\nvery little curiosity about his performance, the work is scarce; and I do\r\nnot know where to refer the reader for any account of its details, except,\r\nto the partial reprint of Wilkins presently mentioned under 1802, in which\r\nthere is an unsatisfactory abstract. There is nothing in the _Biographia\r\nBritannica_, except discussion of Anthony Wood's statement that the hint\r\nwas derived from Dalgarno's book, {117} _De Signis_, 1661.[226] Hamilton\r\n(_Discussions_, Art. 5, \"Dalgarno\") does not say a word on this point,\r\nbeyond quoting Wood; and Hamilton, though he did now and then write about\r\nhis countrymen with a rough-nibbed pen, knew perfectly well how to protect\r\ntheir priorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREGOIRE DE ST. VINCENT.\r\n\r\n    Problema Austriacum. Plus ultra Quadratura Circuli. Auctore P. Gregorio\r\n    a Sancto Vincentio Soc. Jesu., Antwerp, 1647, folio.--Opus Geometricum\r\n    posthumum ad Mesolabium. By the same. Gandavi [Ghent], 1668,\r\n    folio.[227]\r\n\r\nThe first book has more than 1200 pages, on all kinds of geometry. Gregory\r\nSt. Vincent is the greatest of circle-squarers, and his investigations led\r\nhim into many truths: he found the property of the area of the\r\nhyperbola[228] which led to Napier's logarithms being called _hyperbolic_.\r\nMontucla says of him, with sly truth, that no one has ever squared the\r\ncircle with so much genius, or, excepting his principal object, with so\r\nmuch success.[229] His reputation, and the many merits of his work, led to\r\na sharp controversy on his quadrature, which ended in its complete exposure\r\nby Huyghens and others. He had a small school of followers, who defended\r\nhim in print.\r\n\r\n{118}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRENE DE SLUSE.\r\n\r\n    Renati Francisci Slusii Mesolabum. Leodii Eburonum [Liege], 1668,\r\n    4to.[230]\r\n\r\nThe Mesolabum is the solution of the problem of finding two mean\r\nproportionals, which Euclid's geometry does not attain. Slusius is a true\r\ngeometer, and uses the ellipse, etc.: but he is sometimes ranked with the\r\ntrisecters, for which reason I place him here, with this explanation.\r\n\r\nThe finding of two mean proportionals is the preliminary to the famous old\r\nproblem of the duplication of the cube, proposed by Apollo (not Apollonius)\r\nhimself. D'Israeli speaks of the \"six follies of science,\"--the quadrature,\r\nthe duplication, the perpetual motion, the philosopher's stone, magic, and\r\nastrology. He might as well have added the trisection, to make the mystic\r\nnumber seven: but had he done so, he would still have been very lenient;\r\nonly seven follies in all science, from mathematics to chemistry! Science\r\nmight have said to such a judge--as convicts used to say who got seven\r\nyears, expecting it for life, \"Thank you, my Lord, and may you sit there\r\ntill they are over,\"--may the Curiosities of Literature outlive the Follies\r\nof Science!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES GREGORY.\r\n\r\n1668. In this year James Gregory, in his _Vera Circuli et Hyperbolae\r\nQuadratura_,[231] held himself to have proved that {119} the _geometrical_\r\nquadrature of the circle is impossible. Few mathematicians read this very\r\nabstruse speculation, and opinion is somewhat divided. The regular\r\ncircle-squarers attempt the _arithmetical_ quadrature, which has long been\r\nproved to be impossible. Very few attempt the geometrical quadrature. One\r\nof the last is Malacarne, an Italian, who published his _Solution\r\nGeometrique_, at Paris, in 1825. His method would make the circumference\r\nless than three times the diameter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEAULIEU'S QUADRATURE.\r\n\r\n    La Geometrie Francoise, ou la Pratique aisee.... La quadracture du\r\n    cercle. Par le Sieur de Beaulieu, Ingenieur, Geographe du Roi ...\r\n    Paris, 1676, 8vo. [not Pontault de Beaulieu, the celebrated\r\n    topographer; he died in 1674].[232]\r\n\r\nIf this book had been a fair specimen, I might have pointed to it in\r\nconnection with contemporary English works, and made a scornful comparison.\r\nBut it is not a fair specimen. Beaulieu was attached to the Royal\r\nHousehold, and throughout the century it may be suspected that the\r\nhousehold forced a royal road to geometry. Fifty years before, Beaugrand,\r\nthe king's secretary, made a fool of himself, and [so?] contrived to pass\r\nfor a geometer. He had interest enough to get Desargues, the most powerful\r\ngeometer of his time,[233] the teacher and friend of Pascal, prohibited\r\nfrom {120} lecturing. See some letters on the History of Perspective, which\r\nI wrote in the _Athenaeum_, in October and November, 1861. Montucla, who\r\ndoes not seem to know the true secret of Beaugrand's greatness, describes\r\nhim as \"un certain M. de Beaugrand, mathematicien, fort mal traite par\r\nDescartes, et a ce qu'il paroit avec justice.\"[234]\r\n\r\nBeaulieu's quadrature amounts to a geometrical construction[235] which\r\ngives [pi] = [root]10. His depth may be ascertained from the following\r\nextracts. First on Copernicus:\r\n\r\n\"Copernic, Allemand, ne s'est pas moins rendu illustre par ses doctes\r\necrits; et nous pourrions dire de luy, qu'il seroit le seul et unique en la\r\nforce de ses Problemes, si sa trop grande presomption ne l'avoit porte a\r\navancer en cette Science une proposition aussi absurde, qu'elle est contre\r\nla Foy et raison, en faisant la circonference d'un Cercle fixe, immobile,\r\net le centre mobile, sur lequel principe Geometrique, il a avance en son\r\nTraitte Astrologique le Soleil fixe, et la Terre mobile.\"[236]\r\n\r\nI digress here to point out that though our quadrators, etc., very often,\r\nand our historians sometimes, assert that men of the character of\r\nCopernicus, etc., were treated with contempt and abuse until their day of\r\nascendancy came, nothing can be more incorrect. From Tycho Brahe[237] to\r\nBeaulieu, there is but one expression of admiration for the genius of\r\nCopernicus. There is an exception, which, I {121} believe, has been quite\r\nmisunderstood. Maurolycus,[238] in his _De Sphaera_, written many years\r\nbefore its posthumous publication in 1575, and which it is not certain he\r\nwould have published, speaking of the safety with which various authors may\r\nbe read after his cautions, says, \"Toleratur et Nicolaus Copernicus qui\r\nSolem fixum et Terram _in girum circumverti_ posuit: et scutica potius, aut\r\nflagello, quam reprehensione dignus est.\"[239] Maurolycus was a mild and\r\nsomewhat contemptuous satirist, when expressing disapproval: as we should\r\nnow say, he pooh-poohed his opponents; but, unless the above be an\r\ninstance, he was never savage nor impetuous. I am fully satisfied that the\r\nmeaning of the sentence is, that Copernicus, who turned the earth like a\r\nboy's top, ought rather to have a whip given him wherewith to keep up his\r\nplaything than a serious refutation. To speak of _tolerating_ a person _as\r\nbeing_ more worthy of a flogging than an argument, is almost a\r\ncontradiction.\r\n\r\nI will now extract Beaulieu's treatise on algebra, entire.\r\n\r\n\"L'Algebre est la science curieuse des Scavans et specialement d'un General\r\nd'Armee ou Capitaine, pour promptement ranger une Armee en bataille, et\r\nnombre de Mousquetaires et Piquiers qui composent les bataillons d'icelle,\r\noutre les figures de l'Arithmetique. Cette science a 5 figures\r\nparticulieres en cette sorte. P signifie _plus_ au commerce, et a l'Armee\r\n_Piquiers_. M signifie _moins_, et _Mousquetaire_ en l'Art des bataillons.\r\n[It is quite true that P and M were used for _plus_ and _minus_ in a great\r\nmany old works.] R signifie _racine_ en la mesure du Cube, et en l'Armee\r\n_rang_. Q signifie _quare_ en l'un et l'autre usage. C signifie _cube_ en\r\nla mesure, et _Cavallerie_ en la composition des bataillons et escadrons.\r\nQuant a l'operation de cette science, c'est {122} d'additionner un _plus_\r\nd'avec _plus_, la somme sera _plus_, et _moins_ d'avec _plus_, on soustrait\r\nle moindre du _plus_, et la reste est la somme requise ou nombre trouve. Je\r\ndis seulement cecy en passant pour ceux qui n'en scavent rien du\r\ntout.\"[240]\r\n\r\nThis is the algebra of the Royal Household, seventy-three years after the\r\ndeath of Vieta. Quaere, is it possible that the fame of Vieta, who himself\r\nheld very high stations in the household all his life, could have given\r\npeople the notion that when such an officer chose to declare himself an\r\nalgebraist, he must be one indeed? This would explain Beaugrand, Beaulieu,\r\nand all the _beaux_. Beaugrand--not only secretary to the king, but\r\n\"mathematician\" to the Duke of Orleans--I wonder what his \"fool\" could have\r\nbeen like, if indeed he kept the offices separate,--would have been in my\r\nlist if I had possessed his _Geostatique_, published about 1638.[241] He\r\nmakes bodies diminish in weight as they approach the earth, because the\r\neffect of a weight on a lever is less as it approaches the fulcrum.\r\n\r\n{123}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR MATTHEW HALE.\r\n\r\n    Remarks upon two late ingenious discourses.... By Dr. Henry More.[242]\r\n    London, 1676, 8vo.\r\n\r\nIn 1673 and 1675, Matthew Hale,[243] then Chief Justice, published two\r\ntracts, an \"Essay touching Gravitation,\" and \"Difficiles Nugae\" on the\r\nTorricellian experiment. Here are the answers by the learned and voluminous\r\nHenry More. The whole would be useful to any one engaged in research about\r\nante-Newtonian notions of gravitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Observations touching the principles of natural motions; and especially\r\n    touching rarefaction and condensation.... By the author of _Difficiles\r\n    Nugae_. London, 1677, 8vo.\r\n\r\nThis is another tract of Chief Justice Hale, published the year after his\r\ndeath. The reader will remember that _motion_, in old philosophy, meant any\r\nchange from state to state: what we now describe as _motion_ was _local\r\nmotion_. This is a very philosophical book, about _flux_ and _materia\r\nprima_, _virtus activa_ and _essentialis_, and other fundamentals. I think\r\nStephen Hales, the author of the \"Vegetable Statics,\" has the writings of\r\nthe Chief Justice sometimes attributed to him, which is very puny justice\r\nindeed.[244] Matthew Hale died in 1676, and from his devotion to science it\r\nprobably arose that his famous _Pleas of the Crown_[245] and other law\r\nworks did not appear until after his death. One of his {124} contemporaries\r\nwas the astronomer Thomas Street, whose _Caroline Tables_[246] were several\r\ntimes printed: another contemporary was his brother judge, Sir Thomas\r\nStreet.[247] But of the astronomer absolutely nothing is known: it is very\r\nunlikely that he and the judge were the same person, but there is not a bit\r\nof positive evidence either for or against, so far as can be ascertained.\r\nHalley[248]--no less a person--published two editions of the _Caroline\r\nTables_, no doubt after the death of the author: strange indeed that\r\nneither Halley nor any one else should leave evidence that Street was born\r\nor died.\r\n\r\nMatthew Hale gave rise to an instance of the lengths a lawyer will go when\r\nbefore a jury who cannot detect him. Sir Samuel Shepherd,[249] the Attorney\r\nGeneral, in opening Hone's[250] first trial, calls him \"one who was the\r\nmost learned man that ever adorned the Bench, the most even man that ever\r\nblessed domestic life, the _most eminent man that ever advanced the\r\nprogress of science_, and one of the [very moderate] best and most purely\r\nreligious men that ever lived.\"\r\n\r\n{125}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE DISCOVERY OF ANTIMONY.\r\n\r\n    Basil Valentine his triumphant Chariot of Antimony, with annotations of\r\n    Theodore Kirkringius, M.D. With the true book of the learned Synesius,\r\n    a Greek abbot, taken out of the Emperour's library, concerning the\r\n    Philosopher's Stone. London, 1678, 8vo.[251]\r\n\r\nThere are said to be three Hamburg editions of the collected works of\r\nValentine, who discovered the common antimony, and is said to have given\r\nthe name _antimoine_, in a curious way. Finding that the pigs of his\r\nconvent throve upon it, he gave it to his brethren, who died of it.[252]\r\nThe impulse given to chemistry by R. Boyle[253] seems to have brought out a\r\nvast number of translations, as in the following tract:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON ALCHEMY.\r\n\r\n    _Collectanea Chymica_: A collection of ten several treatises in\r\n    chymistry, concerning the liquor Alkehest, the Mercury of Philosophers,\r\n    and other curiosities worthy the perusal. Written by Eir.\r\n    Philaletha,[254] Anonymus, J. B. Van-Helmont,[255] Dr. Fr. {126}\r\n    Antonie,[256] Bernhard Earl of Trevisan,[257] Sir Geo. Ripley,[258]\r\n    Rog. Bacon,[259] Geo. Starkie,[260] Sir Hugh Platt,[261] and the Tomb\r\n    of Semiramis. See more in the contents. London, 1684, 8vo.\r\n\r\nIn the advertisements at the ends of these tracts there are upwards of a\r\nhundred English tracts, nearly all of the period, and most of them\r\ntranslations. Alchemy looks up since the chemists have found perfectly\r\ndifferent substances composed of the same elements and proportions. It is\r\ntrue the chemists cannot yet _transmute_; but they may in time: they poke\r\nabout most assiduously. It seems, then, that the conviction that alchemy\r\n_must_ be impossible was a delusion: but we do not mention it.\r\n\r\n{127}\r\n\r\nThe astrologers and the alchemists caught it in company in the following,\r\nof which I have an unreferenced note.\r\n\r\n\"Mendacem et futilem hominem nominare qui volunt, calendariographum dicunt;\r\nat qui sceleratum simul ac impostorem, chimicum.[262]\r\n\r\n \"Crede ratem ventis corpus ne crede chimistis;\r\n      Est quaevis chimica tutior aura fide.\"[263]\r\n\r\nAmong the smaller paradoxes of the day is that of the _Times_ newspaper,\r\nwhich always spells it _chymistry_: but so, I believe, do Johnson, Walker,\r\nand others. The Arabic work is very likely formed from the Greek: but it\r\nmay be connected either with [Greek: chemeia] or with [Greek: chumeia].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Lettre d'un gentil-homme de province a une dame de qualite, sur le\r\n    sujet de la Comete. Paris, 1681, 4to.\r\n\r\nAn opponent of astrology, whom I strongly suspect to have been one of the\r\nmembers of the Academy of Sciences under the name of a country\r\ngentleman,[264] writes very good sense on the tremors excited by comets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Petitioning-Comet: or a brief Chronology of all the famous Comets\r\n    and their events, that have happened from the birth of Christ to this\r\n    very day.

Of these there are to be\r\nseven: six happened in the several times of Enoch, Noah, Moses, Solomon,\r\nChrist, Charlemagne. The seventh, which is to happen at \"the lamb's\r\nmarriage with the bride,\" seems to be that of 1682; but this is only\r\nvaguely hinted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    De Quadrature van de Circkel.

Auctore Johanne Craig.[268]\r\n    London, 1699, 4to.\r\n\r\nThis is a celebrated speculation, and has been reprinted abroad, and\r\nseriously answered. Craig is known in the early history of fluxions, and\r\nwas a good mathematician. {130} He professed to calculate, on the\r\nhypothesis that the suspicions against historical evidence increase with\r\nthe square of the time, how long it will take the evidence of Christianity\r\nto die out. He finds, by formulae, that had it been oral only, it would have\r\ngone out A.D. 800; but, by aid of the written evidence, it will last till\r\nA.D. 3150. At this period he places the second coming, which is deferred\r\nuntil the extinction of evidence, on the authority of the question \"When\r\nthe Son of Man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?\" It is a pity that\r\nCraig's theory was not adopted: it would have spared a hundred treatises on\r\nthe end of the world, founded on no better knowledge than his, and many of\r\nthem falsified by the event. The most recent (October, 1863) is a tract in\r\nproof of Louis Napoleon being Antichrist, the Beast, the eighth Head, etc.;\r\nand the present dispensation is to close soon after 1864.\r\n\r\nIn order rightly to judge Craig, who added speculations on the variations\r\nof pleasure and pain treated as functions of time, it is necessary to\r\nremember that in Newton's day the idea of force, as a quantity to be\r\nmeasured, and as following a law of variation, was very new: so likewise\r\nwas that of probability, or belief, as an object of measurement.[269] The\r\nsuccess of the _Principia_ of Newton put it into many heads to speculate\r\nabout applying notions of quantity to other things not then brought under\r\nmeasurement. Craig imitated Newton's title, and evidently thought he was\r\nmaking a step in advance: but it is not every one who can plough with\r\nSamson's heifer.\r\n\r\nIt is likely enough that Craig took a hint, directly or indirectly, from\r\nMohammedan writers, who make a reply to the argument that the Koran has not\r\nthe evidence derived {131} from miracles. They say that, as evidence of\r\nChristian miracles is daily becoming weaker, a time must at last arrive\r\nwhen it will fail of affording assurance that they were miracles at all:\r\nwhence would arise the necessity of another prophet and other miracles.\r\nLee,[270] the Cambridge Orientalist, from whom the above words are taken,\r\nalmost certainly never heard of Craig or his theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARISTOCRAT AS A SCIENTIST.\r\n\r\n    Copernicans of all sorts convicted ... to which is added a Treatise of\r\n    the Magnet. By the Hon. Edw. Howard, of Berks. London, 1705, 8vo.\r\n\r\nNot all the blood of all the Howards will gain respect for a writer who\r\nmaintains that eclipses admit no possible explanation under the Copernican\r\nhypothesis, and who asks how a man can \"go 200 yards to any place if the\r\nmoving superficies of the earth does carry it from him?\" Horace Walpole, at\r\nthe beginning of his _Royal and Noble Authors_, has mottoed his book with\r\nthe Cardinal's address to Ariosto, \"Dove diavolo, Messer Ludovico, avete\r\npigliato tante coglionerie?\"[271] Walter Scott says you could hardly pick\r\nout, on any principle of selection--except badness itself, he means of\r\ncourse--the same number of plebeian authors whose works are so bad. But his\r\nimplied satire on aristocratic writing forgets two points. First, during a\r\nlarge period of our history, when persons of rank condescended to write,\r\nthey veiled themselves under \"a person of honor,\" \"a person of quality,\"\r\nand the like, when not wholly undescribed. Not one of these has Walpole\r\ngot; he omits, {132} for instance, Lord Brounker's[272] translation of\r\nDescartes on Music. Secondly, Walpole only takes the heads of houses: this\r\ncuts both ways; he equally eliminates the Hon. Robert Boyle and the\r\nprecious Edward Howard. The last writer is hardly out of the time in which\r\naristocracy suppressed its names; the avowal was then usually meant to make\r\nthe author's greatness useful to the book. In our day, literary peers and\r\nhonorables are very favorably known, and contain an eminent class.[273]\r\nThey rough it like others, and if such a specimen as Edw. Howard were now\r\nto appear, he would be greeted with\r\n\r\n \"Hereditary noodle! knowest thou not\r\n  Who would be wise, himself must make him so?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LONGITUDE PROBLEM.\r\n\r\n    A new and easy method to find the longitude at land or sea. London,\r\n    1710, 4to.\r\n\r\nThis tract is a little earlier than the great epoch of such publications\r\n(1714), and professes to find the longitude by the observed altitudes of\r\nthe moon and two stars.[274] {133}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    A new method for discovering the longitude both at sea and land, humbly\r\n    proposed to the consideration of the public.[275] By Wm. Whiston[276]\r\n    and Humphry Ditton.[277] London, 1714, 8vo.\r\n\r\nThis is the celebrated tract, written by the two Arian heretics. Swift,\r\nwhose orthodoxy was as undoubted as his meekness, wrote upon it the\r\nepigram--if, indeed, that be epigram of which the point is pious\r\nwish--which has been so often recited for the purity of its style, a purity\r\nwhich transcends modern printing. Perhaps some readers may think that Swift\r\ncared little for Whiston and Ditton, except as a chance hearing of their\r\nplan pointed them out as good marks. But it was not so: the clique had\r\ntheir eye on the guilty pair before the publication of the tract. The\r\npreface is dated July 7; and ten days afterwards Arbuthnot[278] writes as\r\nfollows to Swift:\r\n\r\n\"Whiston has at last published his project of the longitude; the most\r\nridiculous thing that ever was thought on. But a pox on him! he has spoiled\r\none of my papers of Scriblerus, which was a proposition for the longitude\r\nnot very unlike his, to this purpose; that since there was no pole for east\r\nand west, that all the princes of Europe should join and build two\r\nprodigious poles, upon high mountains, {134} with a vast lighthouse to\r\nserve for a polestar. I was thinking of a calculation of the time, charges,\r\nand dimensions. Now you must understand his project is by lighthouses, and\r\nexplosion of bombs at a certain hour.\"\r\n\r\nThe plan was certainly impracticable; but Whiston and Ditton might have\r\nretorted that they were nearer to the longitude than their satirist to the\r\nkingdom of heaven, or even to a bishopric. Arbuthnot, I think, here and\r\nelsewhere, reveals himself as the calculator who kept Swift right in his\r\nproportions in the matter of the Lilliputians, Brobdingnagians, etc. Swift\r\nwas very ignorant about things connected with number. He writes to Stella\r\nthat he has discovered that leap-year comes every four years, and that all\r\nhis life he had thought it came every three years. Did he begin with the\r\nmistake of Caesar's priests? Whether or no, when I find the person who did\r\nnot understand leap-year inventing satellites of Mars in correct accordance\r\nwith Kepler's third law, I feel sure he must have had help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AURORA BOREALIS.\r\n\r\n    An essay concerning the late apparition in the heavens on the 6th of\r\n    March. Proving by mathematical, logical, and moral arguments, that it\r\n    cou'd not have been produced meerly by the ordinary course of nature,\r\n    but must of necessity be a prodigy. Humbly offered to the consideration\r\n    of the Royal Society. London, 1716, 8vo.\r\n\r\nThe prodigy, as described, was what we should call a very decided and\r\nunusual aurora borealis. The inference was, that men's sins were bringing\r\non the end of the world. The author thinks that if one of the old\r\n\"threatening prophets\" were then alive, he would give \"something like the\r\nfollowing.\" I quote a few sentences of the notion which the author had of\r\nthe way in which Ezekiel, for instance, would have addressed his Maker in\r\nthe reign of George the First:\r\n\r\n\"Begin! Begin! O Sovereign, for once, with an {135} effectual clap of\r\nthunder.... O Deity! either thunder to us no more, or when you thunder, do\r\nit home, and strike with vengeance to the mark.... 'Tis not enough to raise\r\na storm, unless you follow it with a blow, and the thunder without the\r\nbolt, signifies just nothing at all.... Are then your lightnings of so\r\nshort a sight, that they don't know how to hit, unless a mountain stands\r\nlike a barrier in their way? Or perhaps so many eyes open in the firmament\r\nmake you lose your aim when you shoot the arrow? Is it this? No! but, my\r\ndear Lord, it is your custom never to take hold of your arms till you have\r\nfirst bound round your majestic countenance with gathered mists and\r\nclouds.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    The principles of the Philosophy of the Expansive and Contractive\r\n    Forces ... By Robert Greene,[279] M.A., Fellow of Clare Hall.\r\n    Cambridge, 1727, folio.\r\n\r\nSanderson[280] writes to Jones,[281] \"The gentleman has been reputed mad\r\nfor these two years last past, but never gave the world such ample\r\ntestimony of it before.\" This was said of a former work of Greene's, on\r\nsolid geometry, published in 1712, in which he gives a quadrature.[282] He\r\ngives the same or another, I do not know which, in the present work, in\r\nwhich the circle is 3-1/5 diameters. This volume is of 981 good folio\r\npages, and treats of all things, mental and material. The author is not at\r\nall mad, only wrong on {136} many points. It is the weakness of the\r\northodox follower of any received system to impute insanity to the solitary\r\ndissentient: which is voted (in due time) a very wrong opinion about\r\nCopernicus, Columbus, or Galileo, but quite right about Robert Greene. If\r\nmisconceptions, acted on by too much self-opinion, be sufficient evidence\r\nof madness, it would be a curious inquiry what is the least per-centage of\r\nthe reigning school which has been insane at any one time. Greene is one of\r\nthe sources for Newton being led to think of gravitation by the fall of an\r\napple: his authority is the gossip of Martin Folkes.[283] Probably Folkes\r\nhad it from Newton's niece, Mrs. Conduitt, whom Voltaire acknowledges as\r\n_his authority_.[284] It is in the draft found among Conduitt's papers of\r\nmemoranda to be sent to Fontenelle. But Fontenelle, though a great retailer\r\nof anecdote, does not mention it in his _eloge_ of Newton; whence it may be\r\nsuspected that it was left out in the copy forwarded to France. D'Israeli\r\nhas got an improvement on the story: the apple \"struck him a smart blow on\r\nthe head\": no doubt taking him just on the organ of causality. He was\r\n\"surprised at the force of the stroke\" from so small an apple: but then the\r\napple had a mission; Homer would have said {137} it was Minerva in the form\r\nof an apple. \"This led him to consider the accelerating motion of falling\r\nbodies,\" which Galileo had settled long before: \"from whence he deduced the\r\nprinciple of gravity,\" which many had considered before him, but no one had\r\n_deduced anything from it_. I cannot imagine whence D'Israeli got the rap\r\non the head, I mean got it for Newton: this is very unlike his usual\r\naccounts of things. The story is pleasant and possible: its only defect is\r\nthat various writings, well known to Newton, a very _learned_\r\nmathematician, had given more suggestion than a whole sack of apples could\r\nhave done, if they had tumbled on that mighty head all at once. And\r\nPemberton, speaking from Newton himself, says nothing more than that the\r\nidea of the moon being retained by the same force which causes the fall of\r\nbodies struck him for the first time while meditating in a garden. One\r\nparticular tree at Woolsthorpe has been selected as the gallows of the\r\nappleshaped goddess: it died in 1820, and Mr. Turnor[285] kept the wood;\r\nbut Sir D. Brewster[286] brought away a bit of root in 1814, and must have\r\nhad it on his conscience for 43 years that he may have killed the tree.\r\nKepler's suggestion of gravitation with the inverse distance, and\r\nBouillaud's proposed substitution of the inverse square of the distance,\r\nare things which Newton knew better than his modern readers. I discovered\r\ntwo anagrams on his name, which are quite conclusive; the notion of\r\ngravitation was _not new_; but Newton _went on_. Some wandering spirit,\r\nprobably whose business it was to resent any liberty taken with Newton's\r\nname, put into the head of a friend of mine _eighty-one_ anagrams on my own\r\npair, some of which hit harder than any apple.\r\n\r\n{138}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDE MORGAN ANAGRAMS.\r\n\r\nThis friend, whom I must not name, has since made it up to about 800\r\nanagrams on my name, of which I have seen about 650. Two of them I have\r\njoined in the title-page: the reader may find the sense. A few of the\r\nothers are personal remarks.\r\n\r\n \"Great gun! do us a sum!\"\r\n\r\nis a sneer at my pursuits: but,\r\n\r\n \"Go! great sum!

By Sir Isaac Newton. Translated\r\n    into English. London, 1728, 8vo.\r\n\r\nI think I have a right to one little paradox of my own: I greatly doubt\r\nthat Newton wrote this book. Castiglione,[290] in his _Newtoni\r\nOpuscula_,[291] gives it in the Latin which appeared in 1731,[292] not for\r\nthe first time; he says _Angli omnes Newtono tribuunt_.[293] It appeared\r\njust after Newton's death, without the name of any editor, or any allusion\r\nto Newton's {140} recent departure, purporting to be that popular treatise\r\nwhich Newton, at the beginning of the third book of the _Principia_, says\r\nhe wrote, intending it to be the third book. It is very possible that some\r\nobservant turnpenny might construct such a treatise as this from the third\r\nbook, that it might be ready for publication the moment Newton could not\r\ndisown it. It has been treated with singular silence: the name of the\r\neditor has never been given. Rigaud[294] mentions it without a word: I\r\ncannot find it in Brewster's _Newton_, nor in the _Biographia Britannica_.\r\nThere is no copy in the Catalogue of the Royal Society's Library, either in\r\nEnglish or Latin, except in Castiglione. I am open to correction; but I\r\nthink nothing from Newton's acknowledged works will prove--as laid down in\r\nthe suspected work--that he took Numa's temple of Vesta, with a central\r\nfire, to be intended to symbolize the sun as the center of our system, in\r\nthe Copernican sense.[295]\r\n\r\nMr. Edleston[296] gives an account of the _lectures_ \"de motu corporum,\"\r\nand gives the corresponding pages of the _Latin_ \"De Systemate Mundi\" of\r\n1731. But no one mentions the _English_ of 1728. This English seems to\r\nagree with the Latin; but there is a mystery about it. The preface says,\r\n\"That this work as here published is genuine will so clearly appear by the\r\nintrinsic marks it bears, that it will be but losing words and the reader's\r\ntime to take pains in giving him any other satisfaction.\" Surely fewer\r\nwords would have been lost if the prefator had said at once that the work\r\nwas from the manuscript preserved at Cambridge. Perhaps it was a mangled\r\ncopy clandestinely taken and interpreted. {141}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA BACONIAN CONTROVERSY.\r\n\r\n    Lord Bacon not the author of \"The Christian Paradoxes,\" being a reprint\r\n    of \"Memorials of Godliness and Christianity,\" by Herbert Palmer,\r\n    B.D.[297] With Introduction, Memoir, and Notes, by the Rev. Alexander\r\n    B. Grosart,[298] Kenross. (Private circulation, 1864).\r\n\r\nI insert the above in this place on account of a slight connection with the\r\nlast. Bacon's Paradoxes,--so attributed--were first published as his in\r\nsome asserted \"Remains,\" 1648.[299] They were admitted into his works in\r\n1730, and remain there to this day. The title is \"The Character of a\r\nbelieving Christian, set forth in paradoxes and seeming contradictions.\"\r\nThe following is a specimen:\r\n\r\n\"He believes three to be one and one to be three; a father not to be older\r\nthan his son; a son to be equal with his father; and one proceeding from\r\nboth to be equal with both: he believes three persons in one nature, and\r\ntwo natures in one person.... He believes the God of all grace to have been\r\nangry with one that never offended Him; and that God that hates sin to be\r\nreconciled to himself though sinning continually, and never making or being\r\nable to make Him any satisfaction. He believes a most just God to have\r\npunished a most just person, and to have justified himself, though a most\r\nungodly sinner. He believes himself freely pardoned, and yet a sufficient\r\nsatisfaction was made for him.\"\r\n\r\nWho can doubt that if Bacon had written this it must have been wrong? Many\r\nwriters, especially on the {142} Continent, have taken him as sneering at\r\n(Athanasian) Christianity right and left. Many Englishmen have taken him to\r\nbe quite in earnest, and to have produced a body of edifying doctrine. More\r\nthan a century ago the Paradoxes were published as a penny tract; and,\r\nagain, at the same price, in the _Penny Sunday Reader_, vol. vi, No. 148, a\r\nfew passages were omitted, as _too strong_. But all did not agree: in my\r\ncopy of Peter Shaw's [300] edition (vol. ii, p. 283) the Paradoxes have\r\nbeen cut out by the binder, who has left the backs of the leaves. I never\r\nhad the curiosity to see whether other copies of the edition have been\r\nserved in the same way. The Religious Tract Society republished them\r\nrecently in _Selections from the Writings of Lord Bacon_, (no date; bad\r\nplan; about 1863, I suppose). No omissions were made, so far as I find.\r\n\r\nI never believed that Bacon wrote this paper; it has neither his _sparkle_\r\nnor his idiom. I stated my doubts even before I heard that Mr. Spedding,\r\none of Bacon's editors, was of the same mind. (_Athenaeum_, July 16, 1864).\r\nI was little moved by the wide consent of orthodox men: for I knew how\r\nBacon, Milton, Newton, Locke, etc., were always claimed as orthodox until\r\nalmost the present day. Of this there is a remarkable instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCKE AND SOCINIANISM.\r\n\r\nAmong the books which in my younger day were in some orthodox publication\r\nlists--I think in the list of the Christian Knowledge Society, but I am not\r\nsure--was Locke's [301] \"Reasonableness of Christianity.\" It seems to have\r\ncome down from the eighteenth century, when the battle was belief in Christ\r\nagainst unbelief, _simpliciter_, as the {143} logicians say. Now, if ever\r\nthere was a Socinian[302] book in the world, it is this work of Locke.\r\n\"These two,\" says Locke, \"faith and repentance, i.e., believing Jesus to be\r\nthe Messiah, and a good life, are the indispensable conditions of the new\r\ncovenant, to be performed by all those who would obtain eternal life.\" All\r\nthe book is amplification of this doctrine. Locke, in this and many other\r\nthings, followed Hobbes, whose doctrine, in the Leviathan, is _fidem,\r\nquanta ad salutem necessaria est, contineri in hoc articulo, Jesus est\r\nChristus_.[303] For this Hobbes was called an atheist, which {144} many\r\nstill believe him to have been: some of his contemporaries called him,\r\nrightly, a Socinian. Locke was known for a Socinian as soon as his work\r\nappeared: Dr. John Edwards,[304] his assailant, says he is \"Socinianized\r\nall over.\" Locke, in his reply, says \"there is not one word of Socinianism\r\nin it:\" and he was right: the positive Socinian doctrine has _not one word\r\nof Socinianism in it_; Socinianism consists in omissions. Locke and Hobbes\r\ndid not dare _deny_ the Trinity: for such a thing Hobbes might have been\r\nroasted, and Locke might have been strangled. Accordingly, the well-known\r\nway of teaching Unitarian doctrine was the collection of the asserted\r\nessentials of Christianity, without naming the Trinity, etc. This is the\r\nplan Newton followed, in the papers which have at last been published.[305]\r\n\r\nSo I, for one, thought little about the general tendency of orthodox\r\nwriters to claim Bacon by means of the Paradoxes. I knew that, in his\r\n\"Confession of Faith\"[306] he is a Trinitarian of a heterodox stamp. His\r\nsecond Person takes human nature before he took flesh, not for redemption,\r\nbut as a condition precedent of creation. \"God is so holy, pure, and\r\njealous, that it is impossible for him to be pleased in any creature,\r\nthough the work of his own hands.... [Gen. i. 10, 12, 18, 21, 25, 31,\r\nfreely rendered]. But--purposing to become a Creator, and to communicate to\r\nhis creatures, he ordained in his eternal counsel that one person of the\r\nGodhead should be united to one nature, and to one particular of his\r\ncreatures; that so, in the person of the Mediator, the true ladder might be\r\nfixed, whereby God might {145} descend to his creatures and his creatures\r\nmight ascend to God....\"\r\n\r\nThis is republished by the Religious Tract Society, and seems to suit their\r\ntheology, for they confess to having omitted some things of which they\r\ndisapprove.\r\n\r\nIn 1864, Mr. Grosart published his discovery that the Paradoxes are by\r\nHerbert Palmer; that they were first published surreptitiously, and\r\nimmediately afterwards by himself, both in 1645; that the \"Remains\" of\r\nBacon did not appear until 1648; that from 1645 to 1708, thirteen editions\r\nof the \"Memorials\" were published, all containing the Paradoxes. In spite\r\nof this, the Paradoxes were introduced into Bacon's works in 1730, where\r\nthey have remained.\r\n\r\nHerbert Palmer was of good descent, and educated as a Puritan. He was an\r\naccomplished man, one of the few of his day who could speak French as well\r\nas English. He went into the Church, and was beneficed by Laud,[307] in\r\nspite of his puritanism; he sat in the Assembly of Divines, and was finally\r\nPresident of Queens' College, Cambridge, in which post he died, August 13,\r\n1647, in the 46th year of his age.\r\n\r\nMr. Grosart says, speaking of Bacon's \"Remains,\" \"All who have had occasion\r\nto examine our early literature are aware that it was a common trick to\r\nissue imperfect, false, and unauthorized writings under any recently\r\ndeceased name that might be expected to take. The Puritans, down to John\r\nBunyan, were perpetually expostulating and protesting against such\r\nprocedure.\" I have met with instances of all this; but I did not know that\r\nthere was so much of it: a good collection would be very useful. The work\r\nof 1728, attributed to Newton, is likely enough to be one of the class.\r\n\r\n{146}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Demonstration de l'immobilitez de la Terre....

Hague, 1749,[323] 4to.\r\n\r\nAccording to this octavo geometer and quarto gentleman, a diameter of 81\r\ngives a circumference of 256. There is an amusing circumstance about the\r\nquarto which has been overlooked, if indeed the book has ever been {150}\r\nexamined. John Bernoulli (the one of the day)[324] and Koenig[325] have\r\nboth given an attestation: my mathematical readers may stare as they\r\nplease, such is the fact. But, on examination, there will be reason to\r\nthink the two sly Swiss played their countryman the same trick as the\r\nmedical man played Miss Pickle, in the novel of that name. The lady only\r\nwanted to get his authority against sousing her little nephew, and said,\r\n\"Pray, doctor, is it not both dangerous and cruel to be the means of\r\nletting a poor tender infant perish by sousing it in water as cold as\r\nice?\"--\"Downright murder, I affirm,\" said the doctor; and certified\r\naccordingly. De Faure had built a tremendous scaffolding of equations,\r\nquite out of place, and feeling cock-sure that his solutions, if correct,\r\nwould square the circle, applied to Bernoulli and Koenig--who after his\r\ntract of two years before, must have known what he was at--for their\r\napprobation of the solutions. And he got it, as follows, well guarded:\r\n\r\n    \"Suivant les suppositions posees dans ce Memoire, il est si evident que\r\n    t doit etre = 34, y = 1, et z = 1, que cela n'a besoin ni de preuve ni\r\n    d'autorite pour etre reconnu par tout le monde.[326]\r\n\r\n    \"a Basle le 7e Mai 1749.

KOENIG.\"\r\n\r\nOn which de Faure remarks with triumph--as I have no doubt it was intended\r\nhe should do--\"il conste clairement par ma presente Analyse et\r\nDemonstration, qu'ils y ont deja {151} reconnu et approuve parfaitement que\r\nla quadrature du cercle est mathematiquement demontree.\"[328] It should\r\nseem that it is easier to square the circle than to get round a\r\nmathematician.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    An attempt to demonstrate that all the Phenomena in Nature may be\r\n    explained by two simple active principles, Attraction and Repulsion,\r\n    wherein the attraction of Cohesion, Gravity and Magnetism are shown to\r\n    be one the same. By Gowin Knight. London, 1748, 4to.\r\n\r\nDr. Knight[329] was Mr. Panizzi's[330] archetype, the first Principal\r\nLibrarian of the British Museum. He was celebrated for his magnetical\r\nexperiments. This work was long neglected; but is now recognized as of\r\nremarkable resemblance to modern speculations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS WRIGHT OF DURHAM.\r\n\r\n    An original theory or Hypothesis of the Universe. By Thomas Wright[331]\r\n    of Durham. London, 4to, 1750.\r\n\r\nWright is a speculator whose thoughts are now part of our current\r\nastronomy. He took that view--or most of it--of the milky way which\r\nafterwards suggested itself to William Herschel. I have given an account of\r\nhim and his work in the _Philosophical Magazine_ for April, 1848.\r\n\r\nWright was mathematical instrument maker to the King, {152} and kept a shop\r\nin Fleet Street. Is the celebrated business of Troughton & Simms, also in\r\nFleet Street, a lineal descendant of that of Wright? It is likely enough,\r\nmore likely that that--as I find him reported to have affirmed--Prester\r\nJohn was the descendant of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. Having settled\r\nit thus, it struck me that I might apply to Mr. Simms, and he informs me\r\nthat it is as I thought, the line of descent being Wright, Cole, John\r\nTroughton, Edward Troughton,[332] Troughton & Simms.[333]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBISHOP HORNE ON NEWTON.\r\n\r\n    The theology and philosophy in Cicero's _Somnium Scipionis_ explained.\r\n    Or, a brief attempt to demonstrate, that the Newtonian system is\r\n    perfectly agreeable to the notions of the wisest ancients: and that\r\n    mathematical principles are the only sure ones. [By Bishop Horne,[334]\r\n    at the age of nineteen.] London, 1751, 8vo.\r\n\r\nThis tract, which was not printed in the collected works, and is now\r\nexcessively rare, is mentioned in _Notes and Queries_, 1st S., v, 490, 573;\r\n2d S., ix, 15. The boyish satire on Newton is amusing. Speaking of old\r\nBenjamin Martin,[335] he goes on as follows:\r\n\r\n{153}\r\n\r\n\"But the most elegant account of the matter [attraction] is by that\r\nhominiform animal, Mr. Benjamin Martin, who having attended Dr.\r\nDesaguliers'[336] fine, raree, gallanty shew for some years [Desaguliers\r\nwas one of the first who gave public experimental lectures, before the\r\nsaucy boy was born] in the capacity of a turnspit, has, it seems, taken it\r\ninto his head to set up for a philosopher.\"\r\n\r\nThus is preserved the fact, unknown to his biographers, that Benj. Martin\r\nwas an assistant to Desaguliers in his lectures. Hutton[337] says of him,\r\nthat \"he was well skilled in the whole circle of the mathematical and\r\nphilosophical sciences, and wrote useful books on every one of them\": this\r\nis quite true; and even at this day he is read by twenty where Horne is\r\nread by one; see the stalls, _passim_. All that I say of him, indeed my\r\nknowledge of the tract, is due to this contemptuous mention of a more\r\ndurable man than himself. My assistant secretary at the Astronomical\r\nSociety, the late Mr. Epps,[338] bought the copy at a stall because his eye\r\nwas caught by the notice of \"Old Ben Martin,\" of whom he was a great\r\nreader. Old Ben could not be a Fellow of the Royal Society, because he kept\r\na shop: even though the shop sold nothing but philosophical instruments.\r\nThomas Wright, similarly situated as to shop and goods, never was a Fellow.\r\nThe Society of our day has greatly degenerated: those of the old time would\r\nbe pleased, no doubt, that the glories of their day {154} should be\r\ncommemorated. In the early days of the Society, there was a similar\r\ndifficulty about Graunt, the author of the celebrated work on mortality.\r\nBut their royal patron, \"who never said a foolish thing,\" sent them a sharp\r\nmessage, and charged them if they found any more such tradesmen, they\r\nshould \"elect them without more ado.\"\r\n\r\nHorne's first pamphlet was published when he was but twenty-one years old.\r\nTwo years afterwards, being then a Fellow of his college, and having seen\r\nmore of the world, he seems to have felt that his manner was a little too\r\npert. He endeavored, it is said, to suppress his first tract: and copies\r\nare certainly of extreme rarity. He published the following as his maturer\r\nview:\r\n\r\n    A fair, candid, and impartial state of the case between Sir Isaac\r\n    Newton and Mr. Hutchinson.[339] In which is shown how far a system of\r\n    physics is capable of mathematical demonstration; how far Sir Isaac's,\r\n    as such a system, has that demonstration; and consequently, what regard\r\n    Mr. Hutchinson's claim may deserve to have paid to it. By George Horne,\r\n    M.A. Oxford, 1753, 8vo.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the successors of Newton were very apt to\r\ndeclare that Newton had demonstrated attraction as a _physical_ cause: he\r\nhad taken reasonable pains to show that he did not pretend to this. If any\r\none had said to Newton, I hold that every particle of matter is a\r\nresponsible being of vast intellect, ordered by the Creator to move as it\r\nwould do if every other particle attracted it, and gifted with power to\r\nmake its way in true accordance with that law, as easily as a lady picks\r\nher way across the street; what have you to say against it?--Newton must\r\nhave replied, Sir! if you really undertake to maintain this as\r\n_demonstrable_, your soul had better borrow a little power {155} from the\r\nparticles of which your body is made: if you merely ask me to refute it, I\r\ntell you that I neither can nor need do it; for whether attraction comes in\r\nthis way or in any other, _it comes_, and that is all I have to do with it.\r\n\r\nThe reader should remember that the word attraction, as used by Newton and\r\nthe best of his followers, only meant a _drawing towards_, without any\r\nimplication as to the cause. Thus whether they said that matter attracts\r\nmatter, or that young lady attracts young gentleman, they were using one\r\nword in one sense. Newton found that the law of the first is the inverse\r\nsquare of the distance: I am not aware that the law of the second has been\r\ndiscovered; if there be any chance, we shall see it at the year 1856 in\r\nthis list.\r\n\r\nIn this point young Horne made a hit. He justly censures those who fixed\r\nupon Newton a more positive knowledge of what attraction is than he\r\npretended to have. \"He has owned over and over he did not know what he\r\nmeant by it--it might be this, or it might be that, or it might be\r\nanything, or it might be nothing.\" With the exception of the _nothing_\r\nclause, this is true, though Newton might have answered Horne by \"Thou hast\r\nsaid it.\"\r\n\r\n(I thought everybody knew the meaning of \"Thou hast said it\": but I was\r\nmistaken. In three of the evangelists [Greek: Su legeis] is the answer to\r\n\"Art thou a king?\" The force of this answer, as always understood, is \"That\r\nis your way of putting it.\" The Puritans, who lived in Bible phrases, so\r\nunderstood it: and Walter Scott, who caught all peculiarities of language\r\nwith great effect, makes a marked instance, \"Were you armed?--I was not--I\r\nwent in my calling, as a preacher of God's word, to encourage them that\r\ndrew the sword in His cause. In other words, to aid and abet the rebels,\r\nsaid the Duke. _Thou hast spoken it_, replied the prisoner.\")\r\n\r\nAgain, Horne quotes Rowning[340] as follows:\r\n\r\n{156}\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Rowning, pt. 2, p. 5 in a note, has a very pretty conceit upon this\r\nsame subject of attraction, about every particle of a fluid being\r\nintrenched in three spheres of attraction and repulsion, one within\r\nanother, 'the innermost of which (he says) is a sphere of repulsion, which\r\nkeeps them from approaching into contact; the next, a sphere of attraction,\r\ndiffused around this of repulsion, by which the particles are disposed to\r\nrun together into drops; and the outermost of all, a sphere of repulsion,\r\nwhereby they repel each other, when removed out of the attraction.' So that\r\nbetween the _urgings_, and _solicitations_, of one and t'other, a poor\r\nunhappy particle must ever be at his wit's end, not knowing which way to\r\nturn, or whom to obey first.\"\r\n\r\nRowning has here started the notion which Boscovich[341] afterwards\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nI may add to what precedes that it cannot be settled that, as Granger[342]\r\nsays, Desaguliers was the first who gave experimental lectures in London.\r\nWilliam Whiston gave some, and Francis Hauksbee[343] made the experiments.\r\nThe prospectus, as we should now call it, is extant, a quarto tract of\r\nplates and descriptions, without date. Whiston, in his life, {157} gives\r\n1714 as the first date of publication, and therefore, no doubt, of the\r\nlectures. Desaguliers removed to London soon after 1712, and commenced his\r\nlectures soon after that. It will be rather a nice point to settle which\r\nlectured first; probabilities seem to go in favor of Whiston.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFALLACIES IN A THEORY OF ANNUITIES.\r\n\r\n    An Essay to ascertain the value of leases, and annuities for years and\r\n    lives. By W[eyman] L[ee]. London, 1737, 8vo.\r\n\r\n    A valuation of Annuities and Leases certain, for a single life. By\r\n    Weyman Lee, Esq. of the Inner Temple. London, 1751, 8vo. Third edition,\r\n    1773.\r\n\r\nEvery branch of exact science has its paradoxer. The world at large cannot\r\ntell with certainty who is right in such questions as squaring the circle,\r\netc. Mr. Weyman Lee[344] was the assailant of what all who had studied\r\ncalled demonstration in the question of annuities. He can be exposed to the\r\nworld: for his error arose out of his not being able to see that the whole\r\nis the sum of all its parts.\r\n\r\nBy an annuity, say of L100, now bought, is meant that the buyer is to have\r\nfor his money L100 in a year, if he be then alive, L100 at the end of two\r\nyears, if then alive, and so on. It is clear that he would buy a life\r\nannuity if he should buy the first L100 in one office, the second in\r\nanother, and so on. All the difference between buying the whole from one\r\noffice and buying all the separate contingent payments at different\r\noffices, is immaterial to calculation. Mr. Lee would have agreed with the\r\nrest of the world about the payments to be made to the several different\r\noffices, in consideration of their several contracts: but he differed from\r\nevery one else about the sum to be paid to _one_ office. He contended that\r\nthe way to value an annuity is to find out the term of years which the\r\nindividual has an even chance of surviving, and to charge for the life\r\nannuity the value of an annuity certain for that term.\r\n\r\n{158}\r\n\r\nIt is very common to say that Lee took the average life, or expectation, as\r\nit is wrongly called, for his term: and this I have done myself, taking the\r\ncommon story. Having exposed the absurdity of this second supposition,\r\ntaking it for Lee's, in my _Formal Logic_,[345] I will now do the same with\r\nthe first.\r\n\r\nA mathematical truth is true in its extreme cases. Lee's principle is that\r\nan annuity on a life is the annuity made certain for the term within which\r\nit is an even chance the life drops. If, then, of a thousand persons, 500\r\nbe sure to die within a year, and the other 500 be immortal, Lee's price of\r\nan annuity to any one of these persons is the present value of one payment:\r\nfor one year is the term which each one has an even chance of surviving and\r\nnot surviving. But the true value is obviously half that of a perpetual\r\nannuity: so that at 5 percent Lee's rule would give less than the tenth of\r\nthe true value. It must be said for the poor circle-squarers, that they\r\nnever err so much as this.\r\n\r\nLee would have said, if alive, that I have put an _extreme case_: but any\r\n_universal_ truth is true in its extreme cases. It is not fair to bring\r\nforward an extreme case against a person who is speaking as of usual\r\noccurrences: but it is quite fair when, as frequently happens, the proposer\r\ninsists upon a perfectly general acceptance of his assertion. And yet many\r\nwho go the whole hog protest against being tickled with the tail. Counsel\r\nin court are good instances: they are paradoxers by trade. June 13, 1849,\r\nat Hertford, there was an action about a ship, insured against a _total_\r\nloss: some planks were saved, and the underwriters refused to pay. Mr. Z.\r\n(for deft.) \"There can be no degrees of totality; and some timbers were\r\nsaved.\"--L. C. B. \"Then if the vessel were burned to the water's edge, and\r\nsome rope saved in the boat, there would be no total loss.\"--Mr. Z. \"This\r\nis putting a very extreme case.\"--L. C. B. \"The argument {159} would go\r\nthat length.\" What would _Judge_ Z.--as he now is--say to the extreme case\r\nbeginning somewhere between six planks and a bit of rope?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTUCLA'S WORK ON THE QUADRATURE.\r\n\r\n    Histoire des recherches sur la quadrature du cercle ... avec une\r\n    addition concernant les problemes de la duplication du cube et de la\r\n    trisection de l'angle. Paris, 1754, 12mo. [By Montucla.]\r\n\r\nThis is _the_ history of the subject.[346] It was a little episode to the\r\ngreat history of mathematics by Montucla, of which the first edition\r\nappeared in 1758. There was much addition at the end of the fourth volume\r\nof the second edition; this is clearly by Montucla, though the bulk of the\r\nvolume is put together, with help from Montucla's papers, by Lalande.[347]\r\nThere is also a second edition of the history of the quadrature, Paris,\r\n1831, 8vo, edited, I think, by Lacroix; of which it is the great fault that\r\nit makes hardly any use of the additional matter just mentioned.\r\n\r\nMontucla is an admirable historian when he is writing from his own direct\r\nknowledge: it is a sad pity that he did not tell us when he was depending\r\non others. We are not to trust a quarter of his book, and we must read many\r\nother books to know which quarter. The fault is common enough, but\r\nMontucla's good three-quarters is so good that the fault is greater in him\r\nthan in most others: I mean the fault of not acknowledging; for an\r\nhistorian cannot read everything. But it must be said that mankind give\r\nlittle encouragement to candor on this point. Hallam, in his {160} _History\r\nof Literature_, states with his own usual instinct of honesty every case in\r\nwhich he depends upon others: Montucla does not. And what is the\r\nconsequence?--Montucla is trusted, and believed in, and cried up in the\r\nbulk; while the smallest talker can lament that Hallam should be so unequal\r\nand apt to depend on others, without remembering to mention that Hallam\r\nhimself gives the information. As to a universal history of any great\r\nsubject being written entirely upon primary knowledge, it is a thing of\r\nwhich the possibility is not yet proved by an example. Delambre attempted\r\nit with astronomy, and was removed by death before it was finished,[348] to\r\nsay nothing of the gaps he left.\r\n\r\nMontucla was nothing of a bibliographer, and his descriptions of books in\r\nthe first edition were insufficient. The Abbe Rive[349] fell foul of him,\r\nand as the phrase is, gave it him. Montucla took it with great good humor,\r\ntried to mend, and, in his second edition, wished his critic had lived to\r\nsee the _vernis de bibliographe_ which he had given himself.\r\n\r\nI have seen Montucla set down as an _esprit fort_, more than once: wrongly,\r\nI think. When he mentions Barrow's[350] address to the Almighty, he adds,\r\n\"On voit, au reste, par la, que Barrow etoit un pauvre philosophe; car il\r\ncroyait en l'immortalite de l'ame, et en une Divinite autre que la nature\r\n{161} universelle.\"[351] This is irony, not an expression of opinion. In\r\nthe book of mathematical recreations which Montucla constructed upon that\r\nof Ozanam,[352] and Ozanam upon that of Van Etten,[353] now best known in\r\nEngland by Hutton's similar treatment of Montucla, there is an amusing\r\nchapter on the quadrators. Montucla refers to his own anonymous book of\r\n1754 as a curious book published by Jombert.[354] He seems to have been a\r\nlittle ashamed of writing about circle-squarers: what a slap on the face\r\nfor an unborn Budgeteer!\r\n\r\nMontucla says, speaking of France, that he finds three notions prevalent\r\namong the cyclometers: (1) that there is a large reward offered for\r\nsuccess; (2) that the longitude problem depends on that success; (3) that\r\nthe solution is the great end and object of geometry. The same three {162}\r\nnotions are equally prevalent among the same class in England. No reward\r\nhas ever been offered by the government of either country. The longitude\r\nproblem in no way depends upon perfect solution; existing approximations\r\nare sufficient to a point of accuracy far beyond what can be wanted.[355]\r\nAnd geometry, content with what exists, has long passed on to other\r\nmatters. Sometimes a cyclometer persuades a skipper who has made land in\r\nthe wrong place that the astronomers are in fault, for using a wrong\r\nmeasure of the circle; and the skipper thinks it a very comfortable\r\nsolution! And this is the utmost that the problem ever has to do with\r\nlongitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANTINEWTONIANISMUS.\r\n\r\n    Antinewtonianismus.[356] By Caelestino Cominale,[357] M.D. Naples, 1754\r\n    and 1756, 2 vols. 4to.\r\n\r\nThe first volume upsets the theory of light; the second vacuum, vis\r\ninertiae, gravitation, and attraction. I confess I never attempted these big\r\nLatin volumes, numbering 450 closely-printed quarto pages. The man who\r\nslays Newton in a pamphlet is the man for me. But I will lend them to\r\nanybody who will give security, himself in L500, and two sureties in L250\r\neach, that he will read them through, and give a full abstract; and I will\r\nnot exact security for their return. I have never seen any mention of this\r\nbook: it has a printer, but not a publisher, as happens with so many\r\nunrecorded books.\r\n\r\n{163}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL BLOW TO CIRCLE SQUARERS.\r\n\r\n1755. The French Academy of Sciences came to the determination not to\r\nexamine any more quadratures or kindred problems. This was the consequence,\r\nno doubt, of the publication of Montucla's book: the time was well chosen;\r\nfor that book was a full justification of the resolution. The Royal Society\r\nfollowed the same course, I believe, a few years afterwards. When our Board\r\nof Longitude was in existence, most of its time was consumed in listening\r\nto schemes, many of which included the quadrature of the circle. It is\r\ncertain that many quadrators have imagined the longitude problem to be\r\nconnected with theirs: and no doubt the notion of a reward offered by\r\nGovernment for a true quadrature is a result of the reward offered for the\r\nlongitude. Let it also be noted that this longitude reward was not a\r\npremium upon excogitation of a mysterious difficulty. The legislature was\r\nmade to know that the rational hopes of the problem were centered in the\r\nimprovement of the lunar tables and the improvement of chronometers. To\r\nthese objects alone, and by name, the offer was directed: several persons\r\ngained rewards for both; and the offer was finally repealed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN INTERESTING HOAX.\r\n\r\n    Fundamentalis Figura Geometrica, primas tantum lineas circuli\r\n    quadraturae possibilitatis ostendens. By Niels Erichsen (Nicolaus\r\n    Ericius), shipbuilder, of Copenhagen. Copenhagen, 1755, 12mo.\r\n\r\nThis was a gift from my oldest friend who was not a relative, Dr. Samuel\r\nMaitland of the \"Dark Ages.\"[358] He found it among his books, and could\r\nnot imagine how he came by it: I could have told him. He once collected\r\ninterpretations of the Apocalypse: and auction lots of such {164} books\r\noften contain quadratures. The wonder is he never found more than one.\r\n\r\nThe quadrature is not worth notice. Erichsen is the only squarer I have met\r\nwith who has distinctly asserted the particulars of that reward which has\r\nbeen so frequently thought to have been offered in England. He says that in\r\n1747 the Royal Society on the 2d of June, offered to give a large reward\r\nfor the quadrature of the circle and a true explanation of magnetism, in\r\naddition to L30,000 previously promised for the same. I need hardly say\r\nthat the Royal Society had not L30,000 at that time, and would not, if it\r\nhad had such a sum, have spent it on the circle, nor on magnetic theory;\r\nnor would it have coupled the two things. On this book, see _Notes and\r\nQueries_, 1st S., xii, 306. Perhaps Erichsen meant that the L30,000 had\r\nbeen promised by the Government, and the addition by the Royal Society.\r\n\r\nOctober 8, 1866. I receive a letter from a cyclometer who understands that\r\na reward is offered to any one who will square the circle, and that all\r\ncompetitors are to send their plans to me. The hoaxers have not yet failed\r\nout of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO JESUIT CONTRIBUTIONS.\r\n\r\n    Theoria Philosophiae Naturalis redacta ad unicam legem virium in natura\r\n    existentium. Editio _Veneta_ prima. By Roger Joseph Boscovich. Venice,\r\n    1763, 4to.\r\n\r\nThe first edition is said to be of Vienna, 1758.[359] This is a celebrated\r\nwork on the molecular theory of matter, grounded on the hypothesis of\r\nspheres of alternate attraction and repulsion. Boscovich was a Jesuit of\r\nvaried pursuit. During his measurement of a degree of the meridian, while\r\non horseback or waiting for his observations, he composed a Latin poem of\r\nabout five thousand verses on eclipses, {165} with notes, which he\r\ndedicated to the Royal Society: _De Solis et Lunae defectibus_,[360] London,\r\nMillar and Dodsley, 1760, 4to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Traite de paix entre Des Cartes et Newton, _precede_ des vies\r\n    litteraires de ces deux chefs de la physique moderne.... By Aime Henri\r\n    Paulian.[361] Avignon, 1763, 12mo.\r\n\r\nI have had these books for many years without feeling the least desire to\r\nsee how a lettered Jesuit would atone Descartes and Newton. On looking at\r\nmy two volumes, I find that one contains nothing but the literary life of\r\nDescartes; the other nothing but the literary life of Newton. The preface\r\nindicates more: and Watt mentions _three_ volumes.[362] I dare say the\r\nfirst two contain all that is valuable. On looking more attentively at the\r\ntwo volumes, I find them both readable and instructive; the account of\r\nNewton is far above that of Voltaire, but not so popular. But he should not\r\nhave said that Newton's family came from Newton in Ireland. Sir Rowland\r\nHill gives fourteen _Newtons_ in Ireland;[363] twice the number of the\r\ncities that contended for the birth of Homer may now contend for the origin\r\nof Newton, on the word of Father Paulian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Philosophical Essays, in three parts. By R. Lovett, Lay Clerk of the\r\n    Cathedral Church of Worcester. Worcester, 1766, 8vo.\r\n\r\n    The Electrical Philosopher: containing a new system of physics {166}\r\n    founded upon the principle of an universal Plenum of elementary\r\n    fire.... By R. Lovett, Worcester, 1774, 8vo.\r\n\r\nMr. Lovett[364] was one of those ether philosophers who bring in elastic\r\nfluid as an explanation by imposition of words, without deducing any one\r\nphenomenon from what we know of it. And yet he says that attraction has\r\nreceived no support from geometry; though geometry, applied to a particular\r\nlaw of attraction, had shown how to predict the motions of the bodies of\r\nthe solar system. He, and many of his stamp, have not the least idea of the\r\nconfirmation of a theory by accordance of deduced results with observation\r\nposterior to the theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBAILLY'S EXAGGERATED VIEW OF ASTRONOMY.\r\n\r\n    Lettres sur l'Atlantide de Platon, et sur l'ancien Histoire de l'Asie,\r\n    pour servir de suite aux lettres sur l'origine des Sciences, adressees\r\n    a M. de Voltaire, par M. Bailly.[365] London and Paris, 1779, 8vo.\r\n\r\nI might enter here all Bailly's histories of astronomy.[366] The paradox\r\nwhich runs through them all more or less, is the doctrine that astronomy is\r\nof immense antiquity, coming from some forgotten source, probably the\r\ndrowned island of Plato, peopled by a race whom Bailly makes, as has {167}\r\nbeen said, to teach us everything except their existence and their name.\r\nThese books, the first scientific histories which belong to readable\r\nliterature, made a great impression by power of style: Delambre created a\r\nstrong reaction, of injurious amount, in favor of history founded on\r\ncontemporary documents, which early astronomy cannot furnish. These letters\r\nare addressed to Voltaire, and continue the discussion. There is one letter\r\nof Voltaire, being the fourth, dated Feb. 27, 1777, and signed \"le vieux\r\nmalade de Ferney, V. puer centum annorum.\"[367] Then begin Bailly's\r\nletters, from January 16 to May 12, 1778. From some ambiguous expressions\r\nin the Preface, it would seem that these are fictitious letters, supposed\r\nto be addressed to Voltaire at their dates. Voltaire went to Paris February\r\n10, 1778, and died there May 30. Nearly all this interval was his closing\r\nscene, and it is very unlikely that Bailly would have troubled him with\r\nthese letters.[368]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    An inquiry into the cause of motion, or a general theory of physics. By\r\n    S. Miller. London, 1781, 4to\r\n\r\nNewton all wrong: matter consists of two kinds of particles, one inert, the\r\nother elastic and capable of expanding themselves _ad infinitum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAINT-MARTIN ON ERRORS AND TRUTH.\r\n\r\n    Des Erreurs et de la Verite, ou les hommes rappeles au principe\r\n    universel de la science; ouvrage dans lequel, en faisant remarquer aux\r\n    observateurs l'incertitude de leurs recherches, et leurs meprises\r\n    continuelles, on leur indique la route qu'ils auroient du suivre, pour\r\n    acquerir l'evidence physique sur l'origine du bien et du mal, sur\r\n    l'homme, sur la nature materielle, et la nature sacree; sur la base des\r\n    gouvernements {168} politiques, sur l'autorite des souverains, sur la\r\n    justice civile et criminelle, sur les sciences, les langues, et les\r\n    arts. Par un Ph.... Inc.... A Edimbourg. 1782.[369] Two vols. 8vo.\r\n\r\nThis is the famous work of Louis Claude de Saint-Martin[370] (1743-1803),\r\nfor whose other works, vagaries included, the reader must look elsewhere:\r\namong other things, he was a translator of Jacob Behmen.[371] The title\r\npromises much, and the writer has smart thoughts now and then; but the\r\nwhole is the wearisome omniscience of the author's day and country, which\r\nno reader of our time can tolerate. Not that we dislike omniscience; but we\r\nhave it of our own country, both home-made and imported; and fashions vary.\r\nBut surely there can be but one omniscience? Must a man have but one wife?\r\nNay, may not a man have a new wife while the old one is living? There was a\r\nfamous instrumental professor forty years ago, who presented a friend to\r\nMadame ----. The friend started, and looked surprised; for, not many weeks\r\nbefore, he had been presented to another lady, with the same title, at\r\nParis. The musician observed his surprise, and quietly said, \"Celle-ci est\r\nMadame ---- de Londres.\" In like manner we have a London omniscience now\r\ncurrent, which would make any one start who only knew the old French\r\narticle.\r\n\r\nThe book was printed at Lyons, but it was a trick of French authors to\r\npretend to be afraid of prosecution: it {169} made a book look wicked-like\r\nto have a feigned place of printing, and stimulated readers. A Government\r\nwhich had undergone Voltaire would never have drawn its sword upon quiet\r\nSaint-Martin. To make himself look still worse, he was only ph[ilosophe]\r\nInc...., which is generally read _Inconnu_[372] but sometimes _Incredule_;\r\n[373] most likely the ambiguity was intended. There is an awful paradox\r\nabout the book, which explains, in part, its leaden sameness. It is all\r\nabout _l'homme_, _l'homme_, _l'homme_,[374] except as much as treats of\r\n_les hommes_, _les hommes_, _les hommes_;[375] but not one single man is\r\nmentioned by name in its 500 pages. It reminds one of\r\n\r\n \"Water, water everywhere,\r\n  And not a drop to drink.\"\r\n\r\nNot one opinion of any other man is referred to, in the way of agreement or\r\nof opposition. Not even a town is mentioned: there is nothing which brings\r\na capital letter into the middle of a sentence, except, by the rarest\r\naccident, such a personification as _Justice_. A likely book to want an\r\n_Edimbourg_ godfather!\r\n\r\nSaint-Martin is great in mathematics. The number _four_ essentially belongs\r\nto straight lines, and _nine_ to curves. The object of a straight line is\r\nto perpetuate _ad infinitum_ the production of a point from which it\r\nemanates. A circle [circle] bounds the production of all its radii, tends\r\nto destroy them, and is in some sort their enemy. How is it possible that\r\nthings so distinct should not be distinguished in their _number_ as well as\r\nin their action? If this important observation had been made earlier,\r\nimmense trouble would have been saved to the mathematicians, who would have\r\nbeen prevented from searching for a common measure to lines which have\r\nnothing in common. But, though all straight lines have the number _four_,\r\nit must not be supposed that they are all equal, for a line is the result\r\nof its law and {170} its number; but though both are the same for all lines\r\nof a sort, they act differently, as to force, energy, and duration, in\r\ndifferent individuals; which explains all differences of length, etc. I\r\ncongratulate the reader who understands this; and I do not pity the one who\r\ndoes not.\r\n\r\nSaint-Martin and his works are now as completely forgotten as if they had\r\nnever been born, except so far as this, that some one may take up one of\r\nthe works as of heretical character, and lay it down in disappointment,\r\nwith the reflection that it is as dull as orthodoxy. For a person who was\r\nonce in some vogue, it would be difficult to pick out a more fossil writer,\r\nfrom Aa to Zypoeus, except,--though it is unusual for (,--) to represent an\r\ninterval of more than a year--his unknown opponent. This opponent, in the\r\nvery year of the _Des Erreurs_ ... published a book in two parts with the\r\nsame fictitious place of printing;\r\n\r\n    Tableau Naturel des Rapports qui existent entre Dieu, l'Homme, et\r\n    l'Univers. A Edimbourg, 1782, 8vo.[376]\r\n\r\nThere is a motto from the _Des Erreurs_ itself, \"Expliquer les choses par\r\nl'homme, et non l'homme par les choses. _Des Erreurs et de la Verite_, par\r\nun PH.... INC...., p. 9.\"[377] This work is set down in various catalogues\r\nand biographies as written by the PH.... INC.... himself. But it is not\r\nusual for a writer to publish two works in the same year, one of which\r\ntakes a motto from the other. And the second work is profuse in capitals\r\nand italics, and uses Hebrew learning: its style differs much from the\r\nfirst work. The first work sets out from man, and has nothing to do with\r\nGod: the second is religious and raps the knuckles of the first as follows:\r\n\"Si nous voulons nous preserver de toutes {171} les illusions, et surtout\r\ndes amorces de l'orgueil par lesquelles l'homme est si souvent seduit, ne\r\nprenons jamais les hommes, mais toujours _Dieu_ pour notre terme de\r\ncomparaison.\"[378] The first uses _four_ and _nine_ in various ways, of\r\nwhich I have quoted one: the second says, \"Et ici se trouve deja une\r\nexplication des nombres _quatre_ et _neuf_, qui ont peu embarrasse dans\r\nl'ouvrage deja cite. L'homme s'est egare en allant de _quatre_ a\r\n_neuf_....\"[379] The work cited is the _Erreurs_, etc., and the citation is\r\nin the motto, which is the text of the opposition sermon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FORERUNNER OF THE METRIC SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n    Method to discover the difference of the earth's diameters; proving its\r\n    true ratio to be not less variable than as 45 is to 46, and shortest in\r\n    its pole's axis 174 miles.... likewise a method for fixing an universal\r\n    standard for weights and measures. By Thomas Williams.[380] London,\r\n    1788, 8vo.\r\n\r\nMr. Williams was a paradoxer in his day, and proposed what was, no doubt,\r\nlaughed at by some. He proposed the sort of plan which the\r\nFrench--independently of course--carried into effect a few years after. He\r\nwould have the 52d degree of latitude divided into 100,000 parts and each\r\npart a geographical yard. The geographical ton was to be the cube of a\r\ngeographical yard filled with sea-water taken some leagues from land. All\r\nmultiples and sub-divisions were to be decimal.\r\n\r\nI was beginning to look up those who had made similar proposals, when a\r\nlearned article on the proposal of a {172} metrical system came under my\r\neye in the _Times_ of Sept. 15, 1863. The author cites Mouton,[381] who\r\nwould have the minute of a degree divided into 10,000 _virgulae_; James\r\nCassini,[382] whose foot was to be six thousandths of a minute; and\r\nPaucton,[383] whose foot was the 400,000th of a degree. I have verified the\r\nfirst and third statements; surely the second ought to be the\r\n_six-thousandth_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    An inquiry into the Copernican system ... wherein it is proved, in the\r\n    clearest manner, that the earth has only her diurnal motion ... with an\r\n    attempt to point out the only true way whereby mankind can receive any\r\n    real benefit from the study of the heavenly bodies. By John\r\n    Cunningham.[384] London, 1789, 8vo.\r\n\r\nThe \"true way\" appears to be the treatment of heaven and earth as\r\nemblematical of the Trinity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Cosmology.

By Launcelot Light, of\r\n    Westminster School; and Laetitia Lookabout, of Queen's Square,\r\n    Bloomsbury. [By the Rev. Samuel Parr,[390] LL.D.] 1792. 8vo. (pp.64).\r\n\r\nWhen did we three meet before? The first work has sunk into oblivion: had\r\nit merited its title, it might have {174} lived. It is what the French call\r\na _piece de circonstance_; it belongs in time to the French Revolution, and\r\nin matter to Burke's opinion of that movement. Those who only know its name\r\nthink it was really an attempt to write a philosophical treatise on what we\r\nnow call socialism. Silly government prosecutions gave it what it never\r\ncould have got for itself.\r\n\r\nMary Wollstonecraft seldom has her name spelled right. I suppose the O! O!\r\ncharacter she got made her W_oo_lstonecraft. Watt gives double insinuation,\r\nfor his cross-reference sends us to G_oo_dwin.[391] No doubt the title of\r\nthe book was an act of discipleship to Paine's _Rights of Man_; but this\r\ntitle is very badly chosen. The book was marred by it, especially when the\r\nauthoress and her husband assumed the right of dispensing with legal\r\nsanction until the approach of offspring brought them to a sense of their\r\nchild's interest.[392] Not a hint of such a claim is found in the book,\r\nwhich is mostly about female education. The right claimed for woman is to\r\nhave the education of a rational human being, and not to be considered as\r\nnothing but woman throughout youthful training. The maxims of Mary\r\nWollstonecraft are now, though not derived from her, largely followed in\r\nthe education of girls, especially in home education: just as many of the\r\npolitical principles of Tom Paine, again not derived from him, are the\r\nguides of our actual legislation. I remember, forty years ago, an old lady\r\nused to declare that she disliked girls from the age of sixteen to\r\nfive-and-twenty. \"They are full,\" said she, \"of _femalities_.\" She spoke of\r\ntheir behavior to women as well as to men. She {175} would have been\r\nshocked to know that she was a follower of Mary Wollstonecraft, and had\r\npacked half her book into one sentence.\r\n\r\nThe third work is a satirical attack on Mary Wollstonecraft and Tom Paine.\r\nThe details of the attack would convince any one that neither has anything\r\nwhich would now excite reprobation. It is utterly unworthy of Dr. Parr, and\r\nhas quite disappeared from lists of his works, if it were ever there. That\r\nit was written by him I take to be evident, as follows. Nichols,[393] who\r\ncould not fail to know, says (_Anecd._, vol. ix, p. 120): \"This is a\r\nplayful essay by a first-rate scholar, who is elsewhere noticed in this\r\nvolume, but whose name I shall not bring forward on so trifling an\r\noccasion.\" Who the scholar was is made obvious by Master Launcelot being\r\nmade to talk of Bellendenus.[394] Further, the same boy is made to say,\r\n\"Let Dr. Parr lay his hand upon his heart, if his conscience will let him,\r\nand ask himself how many thousands of wagon-loads of this article [birch]\r\nhe has cruelly misapplied.\" How could this apply to Parr, with his handful\r\nof private pupils,[395] and no reputation for severity? Any one except\r\nhimself would have called on the head-master of Westminster or Eton. I\r\ndoubt whether the name of Parr could be connected with the rod by anything\r\nin print, except the above and an anecdote of his pupil, Tom Sheridan.[396]\r\nThe Doctor had dressed for a dinner visit, and {176} was ready a quarter of\r\nan hour too soon to set off. \"Tom,\" said he, \"I think I had better whip you\r\nnow; you are sure to do something while I am out.\"--\"I wish you would,\r\nsir!\" said the boy; \"it would be a letter of licence for the whole\r\nevening.\" The Doctor saw the force of the retort: my two tutelaries will\r\nsee it by this time. They paid in advance; and I have given liberal\r\ninterpretation to the order.\r\n\r\nThe following story of Dr. Parr was told me and others, about 1829, by the\r\nlate Leonard Horner,[397] who knew him intimately. Parr was staying in a\r\nhouse full of company, I think in the north of England. Some gentlemen from\r\nAmerica were among the guests, and after dinner they disputed some of\r\nParr's assertions or arguments. So the Doctor broke out with \"Do you know\r\nwhat country you come from? You come from the place to which we used to\r\nsend our thieves!\" This made the host angry, and he gave Parr such a severe\r\nrebuke as sent him from the room in ill-humor. The rest walked on the lawn,\r\namusing the Americans with sketches of the Doctor. There was a dark cloud\r\noverhead, and from that cloud presently came a voice which called _Tham_\r\n(Parr-lisp for _Sam_). The company were astonished for a moment, but\r\nthought the Doctor was calling his servant in the house, and that the\r\napparent direction was an illusion arising out of inattention. But\r\npresently the sound was repeated, certainly from the cloud,\r\n\r\n    \"And nearer, clearer, deadlier than before.\"\r\n\r\nThere was now a little alarm: where could the Doctor have got to? They ran\r\nto his bedroom, and there they discovered a sufficient rather than\r\nsatisfactory explanation. The Doctor had taken his pipe into his bedroom,\r\nand had seated himself, in sulky mood, upon the higher bar of a large and\r\ndeep old-fashioned grate with a high mantelshelf. Here he had {177} tumbled\r\nbackwards, and doubled himself up between the bars and the back of the\r\ngrate. He was fixed tight, and when he called for help, he could only throw\r\nhis voice up the chimney. The echo from the cloud was the warning which\r\nbrought his friends to the rescue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nATTACKS ON RELIGIOUS CUSTOMS.\r\n\r\nDays of political paradox were coming, at which we now stare. Cobbett[398]\r\nsaid, about 1830, in earnest, that in the country every man who did not\r\ntake off his hat to the clergyman was suspected, and ran a fair chance of\r\nhaving something brought against him. I heard this assertion canvassed,\r\nwhen it was made, in a party of elderly persons. The Radicals backed it,\r\nthe old Tories rather denied it, but in a way which satisfied me they ought\r\nto have denied it less if they could not deny it more. But it must be said\r\nthat the Governments stopped far short of what their partisans would have\r\nhad them do. All who know Robert Robinson's[399] very quiet assault on\r\nchurch-made festivals in his _History and Mystery of Good Friday_\r\n(1777)[400] will hear or remember with surprise that the _British Critic_\r\npronounced it a direct, unprovoked, and malicious libel on the most {178}\r\nsacred institutions of the national Church. It was reprinted again and\r\nagain: in 1811 it was in a cheap form at 6s. 6d. a hundred. When the\r\nJacobin day came, the State was really in a fright: people thought twice\r\nbefore they published what would now be quite disregarded. I examined a\r\nquantity of letters addressed to George Dyer[401] (Charles Lamb's G.D.) and\r\nwhat between the autographs of Thelwall, Hardy, Horne Tooke, and all the\r\nrebels,[402] put together a packet which produced five guineas, or\r\nthereabouts, for the widow. Among them were the following verses, sent by\r\nthe author--who would not put his name, even in a private letter, for fear\r\nof accidents--for consultation whether they could safely be sent to an\r\neditor: and they were _not_ sent. The occasion was the public thanksgiving\r\nat St. Paul's for the naval victories, December 19, 1797.\r\n\r\n \"God bless me! what a thing!\r\n  Have you heard that the King\r\n    Goes to St. Paul's?\r\n  {179}\r\n  Good Lord! and when he's there,\r\n  He'll roll his eyes in prayer,\r\n  To make poor Johnny stare\r\n    At this fine thing.\r\n\r\n \"No doubt the plan is wise\r\n  To blind poor Johnny's eyes\r\n    By this grand show;\r\n  For should he once suppose\r\n  That he's led by the nose,\r\n  Down the whole fabric goes,\r\n    Church, lords, and king.\r\n\r\n \"As he shouts Duncan's[403] praise,\r\n  Mind how supplies they'll raise\r\n    In wondrous haste.\r\n  For while upon the sea\r\n  We gain one victory,\r\n  John still a dupe will be\r\n    And taxes pay.\r\n\r\n \"Till from his little store\r\n  Three-fourths or even more\r\n    Goes to the Crown.\r\n  Ah, John! you little think\r\n  How fast we downward sink\r\n  And touch the fatal brink\r\n    At which we're slaves.\"\r\n\r\nI would have indicted the author for not making his thirds and sevenths\r\nrhyme. As to the rhythm, it is not much better than what the French sang in\r\nthe Calais theater when the Duke of Clarence[404] took over Louis XVIII in\r\n1814.\r\n\r\n \"God save noble Clarence,\r\n  Who brings our king to France;\r\n    God save Clarence!\r\n  He maintains the glory\r\n  Of the British navy,\r\n    etc., etc.\"\r\n\r\n{180} Perhaps had this been published, the Government would have assailed\r\nit as a libel on the church service. They got into the way of defending\r\nthemselves by making libels on the Church, of what were libels, if on\r\nanything, on the rulers of the State; until the celebrated trials of Hone\r\nsettled the point for ever, and established that juries will not convict\r\nfor one offence, even though it have been committed, when they know the\r\nprosecution is directed at another offence and another intent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHONE'S FAMOUS TRIALS.\r\n\r\nThe results of Hone's trials (William Hone, 1779-1842) are among the\r\nimportant constitutional victories of our century. He published parodies on\r\nthe Creeds, the Lord's Prayer, the Catechism, etc., with intent to bring\r\nthe Ministry into contempt: everybody knew that was his _purpose_. The\r\nGovernment indicted him for impious, profane, blasphemous intent, but not\r\nfor seditious intent. They hoped to wear him out by proceeding day by day.\r\nDecember 18, 1817, they hid themselves under the Lord's Prayer, the Creed,\r\nand the Commandments; December 19, under the Litany; December 20, under the\r\nAthanasian Creed, an odd place for shelter when they could not find it in\r\nthe previous places. Hone defended himself for six, seven, and eight hours\r\non the several days: and the jury acquitted him in 15, 105, and 20 minutes.\r\nIn the second trial the offense was laid both as profanity and as sedition,\r\nwhich seems to have made the jury hesitate. And they probably came to think\r\nthat the second count was false pretence: but the length of their\r\ndeliberation is a satisfactory addition to the value of the whole. In the\r\nfirst trial the Attorney-General (Shepherd) had the impudence to say that\r\nthe libel had nothing of a political tendency about it, but was _avowedly_\r\nset off against the religion and worship of the Church of England. The\r\nwhole {181} is political in every sentence; neither more nor less political\r\nthan the following, which is part of the parody on the Catechism: \"What is\r\nthy duty towards the Minister? My duty towards the Minister is, to trust\r\nhim as much as I can; to honor him with all my words, with all my bows,\r\nwith all my scrapes, and with all my cringes; to flatter him; to give him\r\nthanks; to give up my whole soul to him; to idolize his name, and obey his\r\nword, and serve him blindly all the days of his political life.\" And the\r\nparody on the Creed begins, \"I believe in George, the Regent almighty,\r\nmaker of new streets and Knights of the Bath.\" This is what the\r\nAttorney-General said had nothing of a political tendency about it. But\r\nthis was _on the first trial_: Hone was not known. The first day's trial\r\nwas under Justice Abbott (afterwards C. J. Tenterden).[405] It was\r\nperfectly understood, when Chief Justice Ellenborough[406] appeared in\r\nCourt on the second day, that he was very angry at the first result, and\r\nput his junior aside to try his own rougher dealing. But Hone tamed the\r\nlion. An eye-witness told me that when he implored of Hone not to detail\r\nhis own father Bishop Law's[407] views on the Athanasian Creed, which\r\nhumble petition Hone kindly granted, he held by the desk for support. And\r\nthe same when--which is not reported--the Attorney-General appealed to the\r\nCourt for protection against a {182} stinging attack which Hone made on the\r\nBar: he _held on_, and said, \"Mr. Attorney, what _can_ I do!\" I was a boy\r\nof twelve years old, but so strong was the feeling of exultation at the\r\nverdicts that boys at school were not prohibited from seeing the parodies,\r\nwhich would have been held at any other time quite unfit to meet their\r\neyes. I was not able to comprehend all about the Lord Chief Justice until I\r\nread and heard again in after years. In the meantime, Joe Miller had given\r\nme the story of the leopard which was sent home on board a ship of war, and\r\nwas in two days made as docile as a cat by the sailors.[408] \"You have got\r\nthat fellow well under,\" said an officer. \"Lord bless your Honor!\" said\r\nJack, \"if the Emperor of Marocky would send us a cock rhinoceros, we'd\r\nbring him to his bearings in no time!\" When I came to the subject again, it\r\npleased me to entertain the question whether, if the Emperor had sent a\r\ncock rhinoceros to preside on the third day in the King's Bench, Hone would\r\nhave mastered _him_: I forget how I settled it. There grew up a story that\r\nHone caused Lord Ellenborough's death, but this could not have been true.\r\nLord Ellenborough resigned his seat in a few months, and died just a year\r\nafter the trials; but sixty-eight years may have had more to do with it\r\nthan his defeat.\r\n\r\nA large subscription was raised for Hone, headed by the Duke of\r\nBedford[409] for L105. Many of the leading anti-ministerialists joined: but\r\nthere were many of the other side who avowed their disapprobation of the\r\nfalse pretense. Many could not venture their names. In the list I find:\r\n{183} A member of the House of Lords, an enemy to persecution, and\r\nespecially to religious persecution employed for political purposes--No\r\nparodist, but an enemy to persecution--A juryman on the third day's\r\ntrial--Ellen Borough--My name would ruin me--Oh! minions of Pitt--Oil for\r\nthe Hone--The Ghosts of Jeffries[410] and Sir William Roy [Ghosts of\r\nJeffries in abundance]--A conscientious Jury and a conscientious Attorney,\r\nL1 6s. 8d.--To Mr. Hone, for defending in his own person the freedom of the\r\npress, attacked for a political object, under the old pretense of\r\nsupporting Religion--A cut at corruption--An Earldom for myself and a\r\ntranslation for my brother--One who disapproves of parodies, but abhors\r\npersecution--From a schoolboy who wishes Mr. Hone to have a very grand\r\nsubscription--\"For delicacy's sake forbear,\" and \"Felix trembled\"--\"I will\r\ngo myself to-morrow\"--Judge Jeffries' works rebound in calf by Law--Keep us\r\nfrom Law, and from the Shepherd's paw--I must not give you my name, but God\r\nbless you!--As much like Judge Jeffries as the present times will\r\npermit--May Jeffries' fame and Jeffries' fate on every modern Jeffries\r\nwait--No parodist, but an admirer of the man who has proved the fallacy of\r\nthe Lawyer's Law, that when a man is his own advocate he has a fool for his\r\nclient--A Mussulman who thinks it would not be an impious libel to parody\r\nthe Koran--May the suspenders of the Habeas Corpus Act be speedily\r\nsuspended--Three times twelve for thrice-tried Hone, who cleared the cases\r\nhimself alone, and won three heats by twelve to one, L1 16s.--A\r\nconscientious attorney, L1 6s. 8d.--Rev. T. B. Morris, rector of\r\nShelfanger, who disapproves of the parodies, but abhors the making an\r\naffected zeal for religion the pretext for political persecution--A Lawyer\r\nopposed in principle to {184} Law--For the Hone that set the razor that\r\nshaved the rats--Rev. Dr. Samuel Parr, who most seriously disapproves of\r\nall parodies upon the hallowed language of Scripture and the contents of\r\nthe Prayer-book, but acquits Mr. Hone of intentional impiety, admires his\r\ntalents and fortitude, and applauds the good sense and integrity of his\r\njuries--Religion without hypocrisy, and Law without impartiality--O Law! O\r\nLaw! O Law!\r\n\r\nThese are specimens of a great many allusive mottoes. The subscription was\r\nvery large, and would have bought a handsome annuity, but Hone employed it\r\nin the bookselling trade, and did not thrive. His _Everyday Book_[411] and\r\nhis _Apocryphal New Testament_,[412] are useful books. On an annuity he\r\nwould have thriven as an antiquarian writer and collector. It is well that\r\nthe attack upon the right to ridicule Ministers roused a dormant power\r\nwhich was equal to the occasion. Hone declared, on his honor, that he had\r\nnever addressed a meeting in his life, nor spoken a word before more than\r\ntwelve persons. Had he--which however could not then be done--employed\r\ncounsel and had a _guilty defense_ made for him, he would very likely have\r\nbeen convicted, and the work would have been left to be done by another. No\r\nquestion that the parodies disgusted all who reverenced Christianity, and\r\nwho could not separate the serious and the ludicrous, and prevent their\r\nexistence in combination.\r\n\r\nMy extracts, etc., are from the nineteenth, seventeenth, and sixteenth\r\neditions of the three trials, which seem to have been contemporaneous (all\r\nin 1818) as they are made up into one book, with additional title over all,\r\nand the motto \"Thrice the brindled cat hath mew'd.\" They are published by\r\nHone himself, who I should have said was a publisher {185} as well as was\r\nto be. And though the trials only ended Dec. 20, 1817, the preface attached\r\nto this common title is dated Jan. 23, 1818.[413]\r\n\r\nThe spirit which was roused against the false dealing of the Government,\r\ni.e., the pretense of prosecuting for impiety when all the world knew the\r\nreal offense was, if anything, sedition--was not got up at the moment:\r\nthere had been previous exhibitions of it. For example, in the spring of\r\n1818 Mr. Russell, a little printer in Birmingham, was indicted for\r\npublishing the Political Litany[414] on which Hone was afterwards tried. He\r\ntook his witnesses to the summer Warwick assizes, and was told that the\r\nindictment had been removed by certiorari into the King's Bench. He had\r\nnotice of trial for the spring assizes at Warwick: he took his witnesses\r\nthere, and the trial was postponed by the Crown. He then had notice for the\r\nsummer assizes at Warwick; and so on. The policy seems to have been to wear\r\nout the obnoxious parties, either by delays or by heaping on trials. The\r\nGovernment was odious, and knew it could _not_ get verdicts against\r\nridicule, and _could_ get verdicts against impiety. No difficulty was found\r\nin convicting the sellers of Paine's works, and the like. When Hone was\r\nheld to bail it was seen that a crisis was at hand. All parties in politics\r\nfurnished him with parodies in proof of religious persons having made\r\ninstruments of them. The parodies by Addison and Luther were contributed by\r\na Tory lawyer, who was afterwards a judge.\r\n\r\nHone had published, in 1817, tracts of purely political ridicule: _Official\r\nAccount of the Noble Lord's Bite,_[415] _Trial of the Dog for Biting the\r\nNoble Lord_, etc. These were not touched. After the trials, it is manifest\r\nthat Hone was {186} to be unassailed, do what he might. _The Political\r\nHouse that Jack built_, in 1819; _The Man in the Moon_, 1820; _The Queen's\r\nMatrimonial Ladder_, _Non mi ricordo_, _The R--l Fowls_, 1820; _The\r\nPolitical Showman at Home_, with plates by G. Cruickshank,[416] 1821 [he\r\ndid all the plates]; _The Spirit of Despotism_, 1821--would have been\r\nlegitimate marks for prosecution in previous years. The biting caricature\r\nof several of these works are remembered to this day. _The Spirit of\r\nDespotism_ was a tract of 1795, of which a few copies had been privately\r\ncirculated with great secrecy. Hone reprinted it, and prefixed the\r\nfollowing address to \"Robert Stewart, _alias_ Lord Castlereagh\"[417]: \"It\r\nappears to me that if, unhappily, your counsels are allowed much longer to\r\nprevail in the Brunswick Cabinet, they will bring on a crisis, in which the\r\nking may be dethroned or the people enslaved. Experience has shown that the\r\npeople will not be enslaved--the alternative is the affair of your\r\nemployers.\" Hone might say this without notice.\r\n\r\nIn 1819 Mr. Murray[418] published Lord Byron's _Don Juan_,[419] and Hone\r\nfollowed it with _Don John, or Don Juan Unmasked_, a little account of what\r\nthe publisher to the Admiralty was allowed to issue without prosecution.\r\nThe parody on the Commandments was a case very much in point: and Hone\r\nmakes a stinging allusion to the use of the \"_unutterable Name_, with a\r\nprofane levity unsurpassed by {187} any other two lines in the English\r\nlanguage.\" The lines are\r\n\r\n \"'Tis strange--the Hebrew noun which means 'I am,'\r\n  The English always use to govern d----n.\"\r\n\r\nHone ends with: \"Lord Byron's dedication of 'Don Juan' to Lord Castlereagh\r\nwas suppressed by Mr. Murray from delicacy to Ministers. Q. Why did not Mr.\r\nMurray suppress Lord Byron's _parody_ on the Ten Commandments? _A._ Because\r\nit contains nothing in ridicule of Ministers, and therefore nothing that\r\n_they_ could suppose would lead to the displeasure of Almighty God.\"\r\n\r\nThe little matters on which I have dwelt will never appear in history from\r\ntheir political importance, except in a few words of result. As a mode of\r\nthought, silly evasions of all kinds belong to such a work as the present.\r\nIgnorance, which seats itself in the chair of knowledge, is a mother of\r\nrevolutions in politics, and of unread pamphlets in circle-squaring. From\r\n1815 to 1830 the question of revolution or no revolution lurked in all our\r\nEnglish discussions. The high classes must govern; the high classes shall\r\nnot govern; and thereupon issue was to be joined. In 1828-33 the question\r\ncame to issue; and it was, Revolution with or without civil war; choose.\r\nThe choice was wisely made; and the Reform Bill started a new system so\r\nwell dovetailed into the old that the joinings are hardly visible. And now,\r\nin 1867, the thing is repeated with a marked subsidence of symptoms; and\r\nthe party which has taken the place of the extinct Tories is carrying\r\nthrough Parliament a wider extension of the franchise than their opponents\r\nwould have ventured. Napoleon used to say that a decided nose was a sign of\r\npower: on which it has been remarked that he had good reason to say so\r\nbefore the play was done. And so had our country; it was saved from a\r\nreligious war, and from a civil war, by the power of that nose over its\r\ncolleagues. {188}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS TAYLOR, THE PLATONIST.\r\n\r\n    The Commentaries of Proclus.[420] Translated by Thomas Taylor.[421]\r\n    London, 1792, 2 vols. 4to.[422]\r\n\r\nThe reputation of \"the Platonist\" begins to grow, and will continue to\r\ngrow. The most authentic account is in the _Penny Cyclopaedia_, written by\r\none of the few persons who knew him well, and one of the fewer who possess\r\nall his works. At page lvi of the Introduction is Taylor's notion of the\r\nway to find the circumference. It is not geometrical, for it proceeds on\r\nthe motion of a point: the words \"on account of the simplicity of the\r\nimpulsive motion, such a line must be either straight or circular\" will\r\nsuffice to show how Platonic it is. Taylor certainly professed a kind of\r\nheathenism. D'lsraeli said, \"Mr. T. Taylor, the Platonic philosopher and\r\nthe modern Plethon,[423] consonant to that philosophy, professes\r\npolytheism.\" Taylor printed this in large type, in a page by itself after\r\nthe dedication, without any disavowal. I have seen the following, Greek and\r\ntranslation both, in his handwriting: \"[Greek: Pas agathos hei agathos\r\nethnikos; kai pas christianos hei christianos kakos.] Every good man, so\r\nfar as he is a good man, is a heathen; and every Christian, so far as he is\r\na Christian, is a bad man.\" Whether Taylor had in his head the Christian of\r\nthe New Testament, or whether he drew from those members of the \"religious\r\nworld\" who make manifest the religious flesh and the religious devil, {189}\r\ncannot be decided by us, and perhaps was not known to himself. If a\r\nheathen, he was a virtuous one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW ERA IN FICTION.\r\n\r\n(1795.) This is the date of a very remarkable paradox. The religious\r\nworld--to use a name claimed by a doctrinal sect--had long set its face\r\nagainst amusing literature, and all works of imagination. Bunyan, Milton,\r\nand a few others were irresistible; but a long face was pulled at every\r\nattempt to produce something readable for poor people and _poor children_.\r\nIn 1795, a benevolent association began to circulate the works of a lady\r\nwho had been herself a dramatist, and had nourished a pleasant vein of\r\nsatire in the society of Garrick and his friends; all which is carefully\r\nsuppressed in some biographies. Hannah More's[424] _Cheap Repository\r\nTracts_,[425] which were bought by millions of copies, destroyed the\r\nvicious publications with which the hawkers deluged the country, by the\r\nsimple process of furnishing the hawkers with something more saleable.\r\n\r\n_Dramatic fiction_, in which the _characters_ are drawn by themselves, was,\r\nat the middle of the last century, the monopoly of writers who required\r\nindecorum, such as Fielding and Smollett. All, or nearly all, which could\r\nbe permitted to the young, was dry narrative, written by people who could\r\nnot make their personages _talk character_; they all spoke {190} alike. The\r\nauthor of the _Rambler_[426] is ridiculed, because his young ladies talk\r\nJohnsonese; but the satirists forget that all the presentable novel-writers\r\nwere equally incompetent; even the author of _Zeluco_ (1789)[427] is the\r\nstrongest possible case in point.\r\n\r\nDr. Moore,[428] the father of the hero of Corunna,[429] with good narrative\r\npower, some sly humor, and much observation of character, would have been,\r\nin our day, a writer of the _Peacock_[430] family. Nevertheless, to one who\r\nis accustomed to our style of things, it is comic to read the dialogue of a\r\njealous husband, a suspected wife, a faithless maid-servant, a tool of a\r\nnurse, a wrong-headed pomposity of a priest, and a sensible physician, all\r\ntalking Dr. Moore through their masks. Certainly an Irish soldier does say\r\n\"by Jasus,\" and a cockney footman \"this here\" and \"that there\"; and this\r\nand the like is all the painting of characters which is effected out of the\r\nmouths of the bearers by a narrator of great power. I suspect that some\r\nnovelists repressed their power under a rule that a narrative should\r\nnarrate, and that the dramatic should be confined to the drama.\r\n\r\nI make no exception in favor of Miss Burney;[431] though she was the\r\nforerunner of a new era. Suppose a country {191} in which dress is always\r\nof one color; suppose an importer who brings in cargoes of blue stuff, red\r\nstuff, green stuff, etc., and exhibits dresses of these several colors,\r\nthat person is the similitude of Miss Burney. It would be a delightful\r\nchange from a universal dull brown, to see one person all red, another all\r\nblue, etc.; but the real inventor of pleasant dress would be the one who\r\ncould mix his colors and keep down the bright and gaudy. Miss Burney's\r\nintroduction was so charming, by contrast, that she nailed such men as\r\nJohnson, Burke, Garrick, etc., to her books. But when a person who has read\r\nthem with keen pleasure in boyhood, as I did, comes back to them after a\r\nlong period, during which he has made acquaintance with the great novelists\r\nof our century, three-quarters of the pleasure is replaced by wonder that\r\nhe had not seen he was at a puppet-show, not at a drama. Take some\r\n_labeled_ characters out of our humorists, let them be put together into\r\none piece, to speak only as labeled: let there be a Dominie with nothing\r\nbut \"Prodigious!\" a Dick Swiveller with nothing but adapted quotations; a\r\nDr. Folliott with nothing but sneers at Lord Brougham;[432] and the whole\r\nwill pack up into one of Miss Burney's novels.\r\n\r\nMaria Edgeworth,[433] Sydney Owenson (Lady Morgan),[434] Jane Austen,[435]\r\nWalter Scott,[436] etc., are all of our century; as {192} are, I believe,\r\nall the Minerva Press novels, as they were called, which show some of the\r\npower in question. Perhaps dramatic talent found its best encouragement in\r\nthe drama itself. But I cannot ascertain that any such power was directed\r\nat the multitude, whether educated or uneducated, with natural mixture of\r\ncharacter, under the restraints of decorum, until the use of it by two\r\nreligious writers of the school called \"evangelical,\" Hannah More and\r\nRowland Hill.[437] The _Village Dialogues_, though not equal to the\r\n_Repository Tracts_, are in many parts an approach, and perhaps a copy;\r\nthere is frequently humorous satire, in that most effective form,\r\nself-display. They were published in 1800, and, partly at least, by the\r\nReligious Tract Society, the lineal successor of the _Repository_\r\nassociation, though knowing nothing about its predecessor. I think it right\r\nto add that Rowland Hill here mentioned is not the regenerator of the Post\r\nOffice.[438] Some do not distinguish accurately; I have heard of more than\r\none who took me to have had a logical controversy with a diplomatist who\r\ndied some years before I was born.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RELIGIOUS TRACT SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, an attempt was made by myself and others to collect some\r\ninformation about the _Cheap Repository_ (see _Notes and Queries_, 3d\r\nSeries, vi. 241, 290, 353; _Christian Observer_, Dec. 1864, pp. 944-49). It\r\nappeared that after the Religious Tract Society had existed more than fifty\r\nyears, a friend presented it with a copy of the original prospectus of the\r\n_Repository_, a thing the existence of which was not known. In this\r\nprospectus it is announced that from the plan \"will be carefully excluded\r\nwhatever is enthusiastic, absurd, or superstitious.\" The \"evangelical\"\r\n{193} party had, from the foundation of the Religious Tract Society,\r\nregretted that the _Repository Tracts_ \"did not contain a fuller statement\r\nof the great evangelical principles\"; while in the prospectus it is also\r\nstated that \"no cause of any particular party is intended to be served by\r\nit, but general Christianity will be promoted upon practical principles.\"\r\nThis explains what has often been noticed, that the tracts contain a mild\r\nform of \"evangelical\" doctrine, free from that more fervid dogmatism which\r\nappears in the _Village Dialogues_; and such as H. More's friend, Bishop\r\nPorteus[439]--a great promoter of the scheme--might approve. The Religious\r\nTract Society (in 1863) republished some of H. More's tracts, with\r\nalterations, additions, and omissions _ad libitum_. This is an improper way\r\nof dealing with the works of the dead; especially when the reprints are of\r\npopular works. A small type addition to the preface contains: \"Some\r\nalterations and abridgements have been made to adapt them to the present\r\ntimes and the aim of the Religious Tract Society.\" I think every publicity\r\nought to be given to the existence of such a practice; and I reprint what I\r\nsaid on the subject in _Notes and Queries_.\r\n\r\nAlterations in works which the Society republishes are a necessary part of\r\ntheir plan, though such notes as they should judge to be corrective would\r\nbe the best way of proceeding. But the fact of alteration should be very\r\ndistinctly announced on the title of the work itself, not left to a little\r\nbit of small type at the end of the preface, in the place where trade\r\nadvertisements, or directions to the binder, are often found. And the\r\nplaces in which alteration has been made should be pointed out, either by\r\nmarks of omission, when omission is the alteration, or by putting the\r\naltered sentences in brackets, when change has been made. May any one alter\r\nthe works of the dead at his own discretion? {194} We all know that readers\r\nin general will take each sentence to be that of the author whose name is\r\non the title; so that a correcting republisher _makes use of his author's\r\nname to teach his own variation_. The tortuous logic of \"the trade,\" which\r\nis content when \"the world\" is satisfied, is not easily answered, any more\r\nthan an eel is easily caught; but the Religious Tract Society may be\r\n_convinced_ [in the old sense] in a sentence. On which course would they\r\nfeel most safe in giving their account to the God of truth? \"In your own\r\nconscience, now?\"\r\n\r\nI have tracked out a good many of the variations made by the Religious\r\nTract Society in the recently published volume of _Repository Tracts_. Most\r\nof them are doctrinal insertions or amplifications, to the matter of which\r\nHannah More would not have objected--all that can be brought against them\r\nis the want of notice. But I have found two which the respect I have for\r\nthe Religious Tract Society, in spite of much difference on various points,\r\nmust not prevent my designating as paltry. In the story of Mary Wood, a\r\nkind-hearted clergyman converses with the poor girl who has ruined herself\r\nby lying. In the original, he \"assisted her in the great work of\r\nrepentance;\" in the reprint it is to be shown in some detail how he did\r\nthis. He is to begin by pointing out that \"the heart is deceitful above all\r\nthings and desperately wicked.\" Now the clergyman's name is _Heartwell_: so\r\nto prevent his name from contradicting his doctrine, he is actually cut\r\ndown to _Harwell_. Hannah Moore meant this good man for one of those\r\ndescribed in Acts xv. 8, 9, and his name was appropriate.\r\n\r\nAgain, Mr. Flatterwell, in persuasion of Parley the porter to let him into\r\nthe castle, declares that the worst he will do is to \"play an innocent game\r\nof cards just to keep you awake, or sing a cheerful song with the maids.\"\r\nOh fie! Miss Hannah More! and you a single lady too, and a contemporary of\r\nthe virtuous Bowdler![440] Though Flatterwell be an {195} allegory of the\r\ndevil, this is really too indecorous, even for him. Out with the three last\r\nwords! and out it is.\r\n\r\nThe Society cuts a poor figure before a literary tribunal. Nothing was\r\nwanted except an admission that the remarks made by me were unanswerable,\r\nand this was immediately furnished by the Secretary (_N. and Q._, 3d S.,\r\nvi. 290). In a reply of which six parts out of seven are a very amplified\r\nstatement that the Society did not intend to reprint _all_ Hannah More's\r\ntracts, the remaining seventh is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I am not careful [perhaps this should be _careful not_] to notice\r\nProfessor De Morgan's objections to the changes in 'Mary Wood' or 'Parley\r\nthe Porter,' but would merely reiterate that the tracts were neither\r\ndesigned nor announced to be 'reprints' of the originals [design is only\r\nknown to the designers; as to announcement, the title is ''Tis all for the\r\nbest, The Shepherd of Salisbury Plain, and other narratives by Hannah\r\nMore']; and much less [this must be _careful not_; further removed from\r\nanswer than _not careful_] can I occupy your space by a treatise on the\r\nProfessor's question: 'May any one alter the works of the dead at his own\r\ndiscretion?'\"\r\n\r\nTo which I say: Thanks for help!\r\n\r\nI predict that Hannah More's _Cheap Repository Tracts_ will somewhat\r\nresemble the _Pilgrim's Progress_ in their fate. Written for the cottage,\r\nand long remaining in their original position, they will become classical\r\nworks of their kind. Most assuredly this will happen if my assertion cannot\r\nbe upset, namely, that they contain the first specimens of fiction\r\naddressed to the world at large, and widely circulated, in which\r\ndramatic--as distinguished from puppet--power is shown, and without\r\nindecorum.\r\n\r\n{196}\r\n\r\nAccording to some statements I have seen, but which I have not verified,\r\nother publishing bodies, such as the Christian Knowledge Society, have\r\ntaken the same liberty with the names of the dead as the Religious Tract\r\nSociety. If it be so, the impropriety is the work of the smaller spirits\r\nwho have not been sufficiently overlooked. There must be an overwhelming\r\nmajority in the higher councils to feel that, whenever _altered_ works are\r\npublished, _the fact of alteration should be made as prominent as the name\r\nof the author_. Everything short of this is suppression of truth, and will\r\nultimately destroy the credit of the Society. Equally necessary is it that\r\nthe alterations should be noted. When it comes to be known that the author\r\nbefore him is altered, he knows not where nor how nor by whom, the lowest\r\nreader will lose his interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM FREND.\r\n\r\n    The principles of Algebra. By William Frend.[441] London, 1796, 8vo.\r\n    Second Part, 1799.\r\n\r\nThis Algebra, says Dr. Peacock,[442] shows \"great distrust {197} of the\r\nresults of algebraical science which were in existence at the time when it\r\nwas written.\" Truly it does; for, as Dr. Peacock had shown by full\r\ncitation, it makes war of extermination upon all that distinguishes algebra\r\nfrom arithmetic. Robert Simson[443] and Baron Maseres[444] were Mr. Frend's\r\npredecessors in this opinion.\r\n\r\nThe genuine respect which I entertained for my father-in-law did not\r\nprevent my canvassing with perfect freedom his anti-algebraical and\r\nanti-Newtonian opinions, in a long obituary memoir read at the Astronomical\r\nSociety in February 1842, which was written by me. It was copied into the\r\n_Athenaeum_ of March 19. It must be said that if the manner in which algebra\r\n_was_ presented to the learner had been true algebra, he would have been\r\nright: and if he had confined himself to protesting against the imposition\r\nof attraction as a fundamental part of the existence of matter, he would\r\nhave been in unity with a great many, including Newton himself. I wish he\r\nhad preferred amendment to rejection when he was a college tutor: he wrote\r\nand spoke English with a clearness which is seldom equaled.\r\n\r\nHis anti-Newtonian discussions are confined to the preliminary chapters of\r\nhis _Evening Amusements_,[445] a series of astronomical lessons in nineteen\r\nvolumes, following the moon through a period of the golden numbers.\r\n\r\nThere is a mistake about him which can never be destroyed. It is constantly\r\nsaid that, at his celebrated trial in 1792, for sedition and opposition to\r\nthe Liturgy, etc., he was _expelled_ from the University. He was\r\n_banished_. People cannot see the difference; but it made all the\r\ndifference to {198} Mr. Frend. He held his fellowship and its profits till\r\nhis marriage in 1808, and was a member of the University and of its Senate\r\ntill his death in 1841, as any Cambridge Calendar up to 1841 will show.\r\nThat they would have expelled him if they could, is perfectly true; and\r\nthere is a funny story--also perfectly true--about their first proceedings\r\nbeing under a statute which would have given the power, had it not been\r\ndiscovered during the proceedings that the statute did not exist. It had\r\ncome so near to existence as to be entered into the Vice-Chancellor's book\r\nfor his signature, which it wanted, as was not seen till Mr. Frend exposed\r\nit: in fact, the statute had never actually passed.\r\n\r\nThere is an absurd mistake in Gunning's[446] _Reminiscences of Cambridge_.\r\nIn quoting a passage of Mr. Frend's pamphlet, which was very obnoxious to\r\nthe existing Government, it is printed that the poor market-women\r\ncomplained that they were to be _scotched_ a quarter of their wages by\r\ntaxation; and attention is called to the word by its being three times\r\nprinted in italics. In the pamphlet it is \"sconced\"; that very common old\r\nword for fined or mulcted.\r\n\r\nLord Lyndhurst,[447] who has [1863] just passed away under a load of years\r\nand honors, was Mr. Frend's private pupil at Cambridge. At the time of the\r\ncelebrated trial, he and two others amused themselves, and vented the\r\nfeeling which was very strong among the undergraduates, by chalking the\r\nwalls of Cambridge with \"Frend for ever!\" While thus engaged in what, using\r\nthe term legally, we are probably to call his first publication, he and his\r\nfriends were surprised by the proctors. Flight and chase followed of\r\ncourse: Copley and one of the others, Serjeant Rough,[448] escaped: the\r\n{199} third, whose name I forget, but who afterwards, I have been told was\r\na bishop,[449] being lame, was captured and impositioned. Looking at the\r\nCambridge Calendar to verify the fact that Copley was an undergraduate at\r\nthe time, I find that there are but two other men in the list of honors of\r\nhis year whose names are now widely remembered. And they were both\r\ncelebrated schoolmasters; Butler[450] of Harrow, and Tate[451] of Richmond.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Frend had another noted pupil. I once had a conversation with a\r\nvery remarkable man, who was generally called \"Place,[452] the tailor,\" but\r\nwho was politician, political economist, etc., etc. He sat in the room\r\nabove his shop--he was then a thriving master tailor at Charing\r\nCross--surrounded by books enough for nine, to shame a proverb. The blue\r\nbooks alone, cut up into strips, would have measured Great Britain for\r\noh-no-we-never-mention-'ems, the Highlands included. I cannot find a\r\nbiography of this worthy and able man. I happened to mention William Frend,\r\nand he said, \"Ah! my old master, as I always call him. Many and many a\r\ntime, and year after year, did he come in every {200} now and then to give\r\nme instruction, while I was sitting on the board, working for my living,\r\nyou know.\"\r\n\r\nPlace, who really was a sound economist, is joined with Cobbett, because\r\nthey were together at one time, and because he was, in 1800, etc., a great\r\nRadical. But for Cobbett he had a great contempt. He told me the following\r\nstory. He and others were advising with Cobbett about the defense he was to\r\nmake on a trial for seditious libel which was coming on. Said Place, \"You\r\nmust put in the letters you have received from Ministers, members of the\r\nCommons from the Speaker downwards, etc., about your Register, and their\r\nwish to have subjects noted. You must then ask the jury whether a person so\r\naddressed must be considered as a common sower of sedition, etc. You will\r\nbe acquitted; nay, if your intention should get about, very likely they\r\nwill manage to stop proceedings.\" Cobbett was too much disturbed to listen;\r\nhe walked about the room ejaculating \"D---- the prison!\" and the like. He\r\nhad not the sense to follow the advice, and was convicted.\r\n\r\nCobbett, to go on with the chain, was a political acrobat, ready for any\r\nkind of posture. A friend of mine gave me several times an account of a\r\nmission to him. A Tory member--those who know the old Tory world may look\r\nfor his initials in initials of two consecutive words of \"Pay his money\r\nwith interest\"--who was, of course, a political opponent, thought Cobbett\r\nhad been hardly used, and determined to subscribe handsomely towards the\r\nexpenses he was incurring as a candidate. My friend was commissioned to\r\nhand over the money--a bag of sovereigns, that notes might not be traced.\r\nHe went into Cobbett's committee-room, told the patriot his errand, and put\r\nthe money on the table. \"And to whom, sir, am I indebted?\" said Cobbett.\r\n\"The donor,\" was the answer, \"is Mr. Andrew Theophilus Smith,\" or some such\r\nunlikely pair of baptismals. \"Ah!\" said Cobbett, \"I have known Mr. A. T. S.\r\na long time! he was always a true friend of his country!\" {201}\r\n\r\nTo return to Place. He is a noted instance of the advantage of our jury\r\nsystem, which never asks a man's politics, etc. The late King of Hanover,\r\nwhen Duke of Cumberland, being unpopular, was brought under unjust\r\nsuspicions by the suicide of his valet: he must have seduced the wife and\r\nmurdered the husband. The charges were as absurd as those brought against\r\nthe Englishman in the Frenchman's attempt at satirical verses upon him:\r\n\r\n \"The Englishman is a very bad man;\r\n  He drink the beer and he steal the can:\r\n  He kiss the wife and he beat the man;\r\n  And the Englishman is a very G---- d----.\"\r\n\r\nThe charges were revived in a much later day, and the defense might have\r\ngiven some trouble. But Place, who had been the foreman at the inquest,\r\ncame forward, and settled the question in a few lines. Every one knew that\r\nthe old Radical was quite free of all disposition to suppress truth from\r\nwish to curry favor with royalty.\r\n\r\nJohn Speed,[453] the author of the _English History_,[454] (1632) which\r\nBishop Nicolson[455] calls the best chronicle extant, was a man, like\r\nPlace, of no education, but what he gave himself. The bishop says he would\r\nhave done better if he had a better training: but what, he adds, could have\r\nbeen expected from a tailor! This Speed was, as well as Place. But he was\r\n{202} released from manual labor by Sir Fulk Grevil,[456] who enabled him\r\nto study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA STORY ON SIMSON.\r\n\r\nI have elsewhere noticed that those who oppose the mysteries of algebra do\r\nnot ridicule them; this I want the cyclometers to do. Of the three who\r\nwrote against the great point, the negative quantity, and the uses of 0\r\nwhich are connected with it, only one could fire a squib. That Robert\r\nSimson[457] should do such a thing will be judged impossible by all who\r\nadmit tradition. I do not vouch for the following; I give it as a proof of\r\nthe impression which prevailed about him:\r\n\r\nHe used to sit at his open window on the ground floor, as deep in geometry\r\nas a Robert Simson ought to be. Here he would be accosted by beggars, to\r\nwhom he generally gave a trifle, he roused himself to hear a few words of\r\nthe story, made his donation, and instantly dropped down into his depths.\r\nSome wags one day stopped a mendicant who was on his way to the window with\r\n\"Now, my man, do as we tell you, and you will get something from that\r\ngentleman, and a shilling from us besides. You will go and say you are in\r\ndistress, he will ask you who you are, and you will say you are Robert\r\nSimson, son of John Simson of Kirktonhill.\" The man did as he was told;\r\nSimson quietly gave him a coin, and dropped off. The wags watched a little,\r\nand saw him rouse himself again, and exclaim \"Robert Simson, son of John\r\nSimson of Kirktonhill! why, that is myself. That man must be an impostor.\"\r\nLord Brougham tells the same story, with some difference of details.\r\n\r\n{203}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBARON MASERES.\r\n\r\nBaron Maseres[458] was, as a writer, dry; those who knew his writings will\r\nfeel that he seldom could have taken in a joke or issued a pun. Maseres was\r\nthe fourth wrangler of 1752, and first Chancellor's medallist (or highest\r\nin classics); his second was Porteus[459] (afterward Bishop of London).\r\nWaring[460] came five years after him: he could not get Maseres through the\r\nsecond page of his first book on algebra; a negative quantity stood like a\r\nlion in the way. In 1758 he published his _Dissertation on the Use of the\r\nNegative Sign_,[461] 4to. There are some who care little about + and -, who\r\nwould give it house-room for the sake of the four words \"Printed by Samuel\r\nRichardson.\"\r\n\r\nMaseres speaks as follows: \"A single quantity can never be marked with\r\neither of those signs, or considered as either affirmative or negative; for\r\nif any single quantity, as b, is marked either with the sign + or with the\r\nsign - without assigning some other quantity, as a, to which it is to be\r\nadded, or from which it is to be subtracted, the mark will have no meaning\r\nor signification: thus if it be said that the square of -5, or the product\r\nof -5 into -5, is equal to +25, such an assertion must either signify no\r\nmore than that 5 times 5 is equal to 25 without any regard to the signs, or\r\nit must be mere nonsense and unintelligible jargon. I speak according to\r\nthe foregoing definition, by which the affirmativeness or negativeness of\r\nany quantity implies a relation to another quantity of the same kind to\r\nwhich it {204} is added, or from which it is subtracted; for it may perhaps\r\nbe very clear and intelligible to those who have formed to themselves some\r\nother idea of affirmative and negative quantities different from that above\r\ndefined.\"\r\n\r\nNothing can be more correct, or more identically logical: +5 and -5,\r\nstanding alone, are jargon if +5 and -5 are to be understood as without\r\nreference to another quantity. But those who have \"formed to themselves\r\nsome other idea\" see meaning enough. The great difficulty of the opponents\r\nof algebra lay in want of power or will to see extension of terms. Maseres\r\nis right when he implies that extension, accompanied by its refusal, makes\r\njargon. One of my paradoxers was present at a meeting of the Royal Society\r\n(in 1864, I think) and asked permission to make some remarks upon a paper.\r\nHe rambled into other things, and, naming me, said that I had written a\r\nbook in which two sides of a triangle are pronounced _equal_ to the\r\nthird.[462] So they are, in the sense in which the word is used in complete\r\nalgebra; in which A + B = C makes A, B, C, three sides of a triangle, and\r\ndeclares that going over A and B, one after the other, is equivalent, in\r\nchange of place, to going over C at once. My critic, who might, if he\r\npleased, have objected to extension, insisted upon reading me in unextended\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it must be said that those who wrote on the other idea\r\nwrote very obscurely about it and justified Des Cartes (_De Methodo_)[463]\r\nwhen he said: \"Algebram vero, ut solet doceri, animadverti certis regulis\r\net numerandi formulis ita esse contentam, ut videatur potius ars quaedam\r\nconfusa, cujus usu ingenium quodam modo turbatur et obscuratur, quam\r\nscientia qua excolatur et perspicacius {205} reddatur.\"[464] Maseres wrote\r\nthis sentence on the title of his own work, now before me; he would have\r\nmade it his motto if he had found it earlier.\r\n\r\nThere is, I believe, in Cobbett's _Annual Register_,[465] an account of an\r\ninterview between Maseres and Cobbett when in prison.\r\n\r\nThe conversation of Maseres was lively, and full of serious anecdote: but\r\nonly one attempt at humorous satire is recorded of him; it is an\r\ninstructive one. He was born in 1731 (Dec. 15), and his father was a\r\nrefugee. French was the language of the house, with the pronunciation of\r\nthe time of Louis XIV. He lived until 1824 (May 19), and saw the race of\r\nrefugees who were driven out by the first Revolution. Their pronunciation\r\ndiffered greatly from his own; and he used to amuse himself by mimicking\r\nthem. Those who heard him and them had the two schools of pronunciation\r\nbefore them at once; a thing which seldom happens. It might even yet be\r\nworth while to examine the Canadian pronunciation.\r\n\r\nMaseres went as Attorney-General to Quebec; and was appointed Cursitor\r\nBaron of our Exchequer in 1773. There is a curious story about his mission\r\nto Canada, which I have heard as good tradition, but have never seen in\r\nprint. The reader shall have it as cheap as I; and I confess I rather\r\nbelieve it. Maseres was inveterately honest; he could not, at the bar, bear\r\nto see his own client victorious, when he knew his cause was a bad one. On\r\na certain occasion he was in a cause which he knew would go against him if\r\na certain case were quoted. Neither the judge nor the opposite counsel\r\nseemed to remember this case, and Maseres could not help dropping an\r\nallusion which brought it out. {206} His business as a barrister fell off,\r\nof course. Some time after, Mr. Pitt (Chatham) wanted a lawyer to send to\r\nCanada on a private mission, and wanted a _very honest man_. Some one\r\nmentioned Maseres, and told the above story: Pitt saw that he had got the\r\nman he wanted. The mission was satisfactorily performed, and Maseres\r\nremained as Attorney-General.\r\n\r\nThe _Doctrine of Life Annuities_[466] (4to, 726 pages, 1783) is a strange\r\nparadox. Its size, the heavy dissertations on the national debt, and the\r\ndepth of algebra supposed known, put it out of the question as an\r\nelementary work, and it is unfitted for the higher student by its elaborate\r\nattempt at elementary character, shown in its rejection of forms derived\r\nfrom chances in favor of _the average_, and its exhibition of the separate\r\nvalues of the years of an annuity, as arithmetical illustrations. It is a\r\nclimax of unsaleability, unreadability, and inutility. For intrinsic\r\nnullity of interest, and dilution of little matter with much ink, I can\r\ncompare this book to nothing but that of Claude de St. Martin, elsewhere\r\nmentioned, or the lectures _On the Nature and Properties of Logarithms_, by\r\nJames Little,[467] Dublin, 1830, 8vo. (254 heavy pages of many words and\r\nfew symbols), a wonderful weight of weariness.\r\n\r\nThe stock of this work on annuities, very little diminished, was given by\r\nthe author to William Frend, who paid warehouse room for it until about\r\n1835, when he consulted me as to its disposal. As no publisher could be\r\nfound who would take it as a gift, for any purpose of sale, it was\r\nconsigned, all but a few copies, to a buyer of waste paper.\r\n\r\nBaron Maseres's republications are well known: the _Scriptores\r\nLogarithmici_[468] is a set of valuable reprints, mixed {207} with much\r\nwhich might better have entered into another collection. It is not so well\r\nknown that there is a volume of optical reprints, _Scriptores Optici_,\r\nLondon, 1823, 4to, edited for the veteran of ninety-two by Mr. Babbage[469]\r\nat twenty-nine. This excellent volume contains James Gregory, Des Cartes,\r\nHalley, Barrow, and the optical writings of Huyghens, the _Principia_ of\r\nthe undulatory theory. It also contains, by the sort of whim in which such\r\nmen as Maseres, myself, and some others are apt to indulge, a reprint of\r\n\"The great new Art of weighing Vanity,\"[470] by M. Patrick Mathers,\r\nArch-Bedel to the University of St. Andrews, Glasgow, 1672. Professor\r\nSinclair,[471] of Glasgow, a good man at clearing mines of the water which\r\nthey did not want, and furnishing cities with water which they did want,\r\nseems to have written absurdly about hydrostatics, and to have attacked a\r\ncertain Sanders,[472] M.A. So Sanders, assisted by James Gregory, published\r\na heavy bit of jocosity about him. This story of the authorship rested on a\r\nnote made in his {208} copy by Robert Gray, M.D.; but it has since been\r\nfully confirmed by a letter of James Gregory to Collins, in the\r\nMacclesfield Correspondence. \"There is one Master Sinclair, who did write\r\nthe _Ars Magna et Nova_,[473] a pitiful ignorant fellow, who hath lately\r\nwritten horrid nonsense in the hydrostatics, and hath abused a master in\r\nthe University, one Mr. Sanders, in print. This Mr. Sanders ... is resolved\r\nto cause the Bedel of the University to write against him.... We resolve to\r\nmake excellent sport with him.\"\r\n\r\nOn this I make two remarks: First, I have learned from experience that old\r\nnotes, made in books by their possessors, are statements of high authority:\r\nthey are almost always confirmed. I do not receive them without hesitation;\r\nbut I believe that of all the statements about books which rest on one\r\nauthority, there is a larger percentage of truth in the written word than\r\nin the printed word. Secondly, I mourn to think that when the New Zealander\r\npicks up his old copy of this book, and reads it by the associations of his\r\nown day, he may, in spite of the many assurances I have received that my\r\n_Athenaeum Budget_ was amusing, feel me to be as heavy as I feel James\r\nGregory and Sanders. But he will see that I knew what was coming, which\r\nGregory did not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. FREND'S BURLESQUE.\r\n\r\nIt was left for Mr. Frend to prove that an impugner of algebra could\r\nattempt ridicule. He was, in 1803, editor of a periodical _The Gentleman's\r\nMonthly Miscellany_, which lasted a few months.[474] To this, among other\r\nthings, he contributed the following, in burlesque of the use made of 0, to\r\nwhich he objected.[475] The imitation of Rabelais, a writer {209} in whom\r\nhe delighted, is good: to those who have never dipped, it may give such a\r\nnotion as they would not easily get elsewhere. The point of the satire is\r\nnot so good. But in truth it is not easy to make pungent scoffs upon what\r\nis common sense to all mankind. Who can laugh with effect at six times\r\nnothing is nothing, as false or unintelligible? In an article intended for\r\nthat undistinguishing know-0 the \"general reader,\" there would have been no\r\nforce of satire, if _division_ by 0 had been separated from multiplication\r\nby the same.\r\n\r\nI have followed the above by another squib, by the same author, on the\r\nEnglish language. The satire is covertly aimed at theological phraseology;\r\nand any one who watches this subject will see that it is a very just\r\nobservation that the Greek words are not boiled enough.\r\n\r\nPANTAGRUEL'S DECISION _of the_ QUESTION _about_ NOTHING.\r\n\r\n\"Pantagruel determined to have a snug afternoon with Epistemon and Panurge.\r\nDinner was ordered to be set in a small parlor, and a particular batch of\r\nHermitage with some choice Burgundy to be drawn from a remote corner of the\r\ncellar upon the occasion. By way of lunch, about an hour before dinner,\r\nPantagruel was composing his stomach with German sausages, reindeer's\r\ntongues, oysters, brawn, and half a dozen different sorts of English beer\r\njust come into fashion, when a most thundering knocking was heard at the\r\ngreat gate, and from the noise they expected it to announce the arrival at\r\nleast of the First Consul, or king Gargantua. Panurge was sent to\r\nreconnoiter, and after a quarter of an hour's absence, returned with the\r\nnews that the University of Pontemaca was waiting his highness's leisure in\r\nthe great hall, to propound a question which {210} had turned the brains of\r\nthirty-nine students, and had flung twenty-seven more into a high fever.\r\nWith all my heart, says Pantagruel, and swallowed down three quarts of\r\nBurton ale; but remember, it wants but an hour of dinner time, and the\r\nquestion must be asked in as few words as possible; for I cannot deprive\r\nmyself of the pleasure I expected to enjoy in the company of my good\r\nfriends for a set of mad-headed masters. I wish brother John was here to\r\nsettle these matters with the black gentry.\r\n\r\n\"Having said or rather growled this, he proceeded to the hall of ceremony,\r\nand mounted his throne; Epistemon and Panurge standing on each side, but\r\ntwo steps below him. Then advanced to the throne the three beadles of the\r\nUniversity of Pontemaca with their silver staves on their shoulders, and\r\nvelvet caps on their heads, and they were followed by three times three\r\ndoctors, and thrice three times three masters of art; for everything was\r\ndone in Pontemaca by the number three, and on this account the address was\r\nwritten on parchment, one foot in breadth, and thrice three times thrice\r\nthree feet in length. The beadles struck the ground with their heads and\r\ntheir staves three times in approaching the throne; the doctors struck the\r\nground with their heads thrice three times, and the masters did the same\r\nthrice each time, beating the ground with their heads thrice three times.\r\nThis was the accustomed form of approaching the throne, time out of mind,\r\nand it was said to be emblematic of the usual prostration of science to the\r\nthrone of greatness.\r\n\r\n\"The mathematical professor, after having spit, and hawked, and cleared his\r\nthroat, and blown his nose on a handkerchief lent to him, for he had\r\nforgotten to bring his own, began to read the address. In this he was\r\nassisted by three masters of arts, one of whom, with a silver pen, pointed\r\nout the stops; the second with a small stick rapped his knuckles when he\r\nwas to raise or lower his voice; and a third pulled his hair behind when he\r\nwas to look Pantagruel in the face. Pantagruel began to chafe like a lion:\r\n{211} he turned first on one side, then on the other: he listened and\r\ngroaned, and groaned and listened, and was in the utmost cogitabundity of\r\ncogitation. His countenance began to brighten, when, at the end of an hour,\r\nthe reader stammered out these words:\r\n\r\n\"'It has therefore been most clearly proved that as all matter may be\r\ndivided into parts infinitely smaller than the infinitely smallest part of\r\nthe infinitesimal of nothing, so nothing has all the properties of\r\nsomething, and may become, by just and lawful right, susceptible of\r\naddition, subtraction, multiplication, division, squaring, and cubing: that\r\nit is to all intents and purposes as good as anything that has been, is, or\r\ncan be taught in the nine universities of the land, and to deprive it of\r\nits rights is a most cruel innovation and usurpation, tending to destroy\r\nall just subordination in the world, making all universities superfluous,\r\nleveling vice-chancellors, doctors, and proctors, masters, bachelors, and\r\nscholars, to the mean and contemptible state of butchers and\r\ntallow-chandlers, bricklayers and chimney-sweepers, who, if it were not for\r\nthese learned mysteries, might think that they knew as much as their\r\nbetters. Every one then, who has the good of science at heart, must pray\r\nfor the interference of his highness to put a stop to all the disputes\r\nabout nothing, and by his decision to convince all gainsayers that the\r\nscience of nothing is taught in the best manner in the universities, to the\r\ngreat edification and improvement of all the youth in the land.'\r\n\r\n\"Here Pantagruel whispered in the ear of Panurge, who nodded to Epistemon,\r\nand they two left the assembly, and did not return for an hour, till the\r\norator had finished his task. The three beadles had thrice struck the\r\nground with their heads and staves, the doctors had finished their\r\ncompliments, and the masters were making their twenty-seven prostrations.\r\nEpistemon and Panurge went up to Pantagruel, whom they found fast asleep\r\nand snoring; nor could he be roused but by as many tugs as there had been\r\n{212} bowings from the corps of learning. At last he opened his eyes, gave\r\na good stretch, made half a dozen yawns, and called for a stoup of wine. I\r\nthank you, my masters, says he; so sound a nap I have not had since I came\r\nfrom the island of Priestfolly. Have you dined, my masters? They answered\r\nthe question by as many bows as at entrance; but his highness left them to\r\nthe care of Panurge, and retired to the little parlor with Epistemon, where\r\nthey burst into a fit of laughter, declaring that this learned Baragouin\r\nabout nothing was just as intelligible as the lawyer's Galimathias. Panurge\r\nconducted the learned body into a large saloon, and each in his way hearing\r\na clattering of plates and glasses, congratulated himself on his\r\napproaching good cheer. There they were left by Panurge, who took his chair\r\nby Pantagruel just as the soup was removed, but he made up for the want of\r\nthat part of his dinner by a pint of champagne. The learning of the\r\nuniversity had whetted their appetites; what they each ate it is needless\r\nto recite; good wine, good stories, and hearty laughs went round, and three\r\nhours elapsed before one soul of them recollected the hungry students of\r\nPontemaca.\r\n\r\n\"Epistemon reminded them of the business in hand, and orders were given for\r\na fresh dozen of hermitage to be put upon table, and the royal attendants\r\nto get ready. As soon as the dozen bottles were emptied, Pantagruel rose\r\nfrom table, the royal trumpets sounded, and he was accompanied by the great\r\nofficers of his court into the large dining hall, where was a table with\r\nforty-two covers. Pantagruel sat at the head, Epistemon at the bottom, and\r\nPanurge in the middle, opposite an immense silver tureen, which would hold\r\nfifty gallons of soup. The wise men of Pontemaca then took their seats\r\naccording to seniority. Every countenance glistened with delight; the music\r\nstruck up; the dishes were uncovered. Panurge had enough to do to handle\r\nthe immense silver ladle: Pantagruel and Epistemon had no time for eating,\r\nthey were fully employed in carving. The bill {213} of fare announced the\r\nnames of a hundred different dishes. From Panurge's ladle came into the\r\nsoup plate as much as he took every time out of the tureen; and as it was\r\nthe rule of the court that every one should appear to eat, as long as he\r\nsat at table, there was the clattering of nine and thirty spoons against\r\nthe silver soup-plates for a quarter of an hour. They were then removed,\r\nand knives and forks were in motion for half an hour. Glasses were\r\ncontinually handed round in the mean time, and then everything was removed,\r\nexcept the great tureen of soup. The second course was now served up, in\r\ndispatching which half an hour was consumed; and at the conclusion the wise\r\nmen of Pontemaca had just as much in their stomachs as Pantagruel in his\r\nhead from their address: for nothing was cooked up for them in every\r\npossible shape that Panurge could devise.\r\n\r\n\"Wine-glasses, large decanters, fruit dishes, and plates were now set on.\r\nPantagruel and Epistemon alternately gave bumper toasts: the University of\r\nPontemaca, the eye of the world, the mother of taste and good sense and\r\nuniversal learning, the patroness of utility, and the second only to\r\nPantagruel in wisdom and virtue (for these were her titles), was drank\r\nstanding with thrice three times three, and huzzas and clattering of\r\nglasses; but to such wine the wise men of Pontemaca had not been\r\naccustomed; and though Pantagruel did not suffer one to rise from table\r\ntill the eighty-first glass had been emptied, not even the weakest headed\r\nmaster of arts felt his head in the least indisposed. The decanters indeed\r\nwere often removed, but they were brought back replenished, filled always\r\nwith nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Silence was now proclaimed, and in a trice Panurge leaped into the large\r\nsilver tureen. Thence he made his bows to Pantagruel and the whole company,\r\nand commenced an oration of signs, which lasted an hour and a half, and in\r\nwhich he went over all the matter contained in the Pontemaca address; and\r\nthough the wise men looked very serious during the whole time, Pantagruel\r\nhimself and his whole {214} court could not help indulging in repeated\r\nbursts of laughter. It was universally acknowledged that he excelled\r\nhimself, and that the arguments by which he beat the English masters of\r\narts at Paris were nothing to the exquisite selection of attitudes which he\r\nthis day assumed. The greatest shouts of applause were excited when he was\r\nrunning thrice round the tureen on its rim, with his left hand holding his\r\nnose, and the other exercising itself nine and thirty times on his back. In\r\nthis attitude he concluded with his back to the professor of mathematics;\r\nand at the instant he gave his last flap, by a sudden jump, and turning\r\nheels over head in the air, he presented himself face to face to the\r\nprofessor, and standing on his left leg, with his left hand holding his\r\nnose, he presented to him, in a white satin bag, Pantagruel's royal decree.\r\nThen advancing his right leg, he fixed it on the professor's head, and\r\nafter three turns, in which he clapped his sides with both hands thrice\r\nthree times, down he leaped, and Pantagruel, Epistemon, and himself took\r\ntheir leaves of the wise men of Pontemaca.\r\n\r\n\"The wise men now retired, and by royal orders were accompanied by a guard,\r\nand according to the etiquette of the court, no one having a royal order\r\ncould stop at any public house till it was delivered. The procession\r\narrived at Pontemaca at nine o'clock the next morning, and the sound of\r\nbells from every church and college announced their arrival. The\r\ncongregation was assembled; the royal decree was saluted in the same manner\r\nas if his highness had been there in person; and after the proper\r\nceremonies had been performed, the satin bag was opened exactly at twelve\r\no'clock. A finely emblazoned roll was drawn forth, and the public orator\r\nread to the gaping assembly the following words:\r\n\r\n\"'They who can make something out of nothing shall have nothing to eat at\r\nthe court of--PANTAGRUEL.'\" {215}\r\n\r\nORIGIN _of the_ ENGLISH LANGUAGE, _related by a_ SWEDE.\r\n\r\n\"Some months ago in a party in Holland, consisting of natives of various\r\ncountries, the merit of their respective languages became a topic of\r\nconversation. A Swede, who had been a great traveler, and could converse in\r\nmost of the modern languages of Europe, laughed very heartily at an\r\nEnglishman, who had ventured to speak in praise of the tongue of his dear\r\ncountry. I never had any trouble, says he, in learning English. To my very\r\ngreat surprise, the moment I sat foot on shore at Gravesend, I found out,\r\nthat I could understand, with very little trouble, every word that was\r\nsaid. It was a mere jargon, made up of German, French, and Italian, with\r\nnow and then a word from the Spanish, Latin or Greek. I had only to bring\r\nmy mouth to their mode of speaking, which was done with ease in less than a\r\nweek, and I was everywhere taken for a true-born Englishman; a privilege by\r\nthe way of no small importance in a country, where each man, God knows why,\r\nthinks his foggy island superior to any other part of the world: and though\r\nhis door is never free from some dun or other coming for a tax, and if he\r\nsteps out of it he is sure to be knocked down or to have his pocket picked,\r\nyet he has the insolence to think every foreigner a miserable slave, and\r\nhis country the seat of everything wretched. They may talk of liberty as\r\nthey please, but Spain or Turkey for my money: barring the bowstring and\r\nthe inquisition, they are the most comfortable countries under heaven, and\r\nyou need not be afraid of either, if you do not talk of religion and\r\npolitics. I do not see much difference too in this respect in England, for\r\nwhen I was there, one of their most eminent men for learning was put in\r\nprison for a couple of years, and got his death for translating one of\r\nAEsop's fables into English, which every child in Spain and Turkey is\r\ntaught, as soon as he comes out of his leading strings. Here all the\r\ncompany unanimously cried out against the Swede, that it was {216}\r\nimpossible: for in England, the land of liberty, the only thing its worst\r\nenemies could say against it, was, that they paid for their liberty a much\r\ngreater price than it was worth.--Every man there had a fair trial\r\naccording to laws, which everybody could understand; and the judges were\r\ncool, patient, discerning men, who never took the part of the crown against\r\nthe prisoner, but gave him every assistance possible for his defense.\r\n\r\n\"The Swede was borne down, but not convinced; and he seemed determined to\r\nspit out all his venom. Well, says he, at any rate you will not deny that\r\nthe English have not got a language of their own, and that they came by it\r\nin a very odd way. Of this at least I am certain, for the whole history was\r\nrelated to me by a witch in Lapland, whilst I was bargaining for a wind.\r\nHere the company were all in unison again for the story.\r\n\r\n\"In ancient times, said the old hag, the English occupied a spot in\r\nTartary, where they lived sulkily by themselves, unknowing and unknown. By\r\na great convulsion that took place in China, the inhabitants of that and\r\nthe adjoining parts of Tartary were driven from their seats, and after\r\nvarious wanderings took up their abode in Germany. During this time nobody\r\ncould understand the English, for they did not talk, but hissed like so\r\nmany snakes. The poor people felt uneasy under this circumstance, and in\r\none of their parliaments, or rather hissing meetings, it was determined to\r\nseek a remedy: and an embassy was sent to some of our sisterhood then\r\nliving on Mount Hecla. They were put to a nonplus, and summoned the Devil\r\nto their relief. To him the English presented their petitions, and\r\nexplained their sad case; and he, upon certain conditions, promised to\r\nbefriend them, and to give them a language. The poor Devil was little aware\r\nof what he had promised; but he is, as all the world knows, a man of too\r\nmuch honor to break his word. Up and down the world then he went in quest\r\nof this new language: visited all the universities, and all {217} the\r\nschools, and all the courts of law, and all the play-houses, and all the\r\nprisons; never was poor devil so fagged. It would have made your heart\r\nbleed to see him. Thrice did he go round the earth in every parallel of\r\nlatitude; and at last, wearied and jaded out, back came he to Hecla in\r\ndespair, and would have thrown himself into the volcano, if he had been\r\nmade of combustible materials. Luckily at that time our sisters were\r\nengaged in settling the balance of Europe; and whilst they were looking\r\nover projects, and counter-projects, and ultimatums, and post ultimatums,\r\nthe poor Devil, unable to assist them was groaning in a corner and\r\nruminating over his sad condition.\r\n\r\n\"On a sudden, a hellish joy overspread his countenance; up he jumped, and,\r\nlike Archimedes of old, ran like a madman amongst the throng, turning over\r\ntables, and papers, and witches, roaring out for a full hour together\r\nnothing else but 'tis found, 'tis found! Away were sent the sisterhood in\r\nevery direction, some to traverse all the corners of the earth, and others\r\nto prepare a larger caldron than had ever yet been set upon Hecla. The\r\naffairs of Europe were at a stand: its balance was thrown aside; prime\r\nministers and ambassadors were everywhere in the utmost confusion; and, by\r\nthe way, they have never been able to find the balance since that time, and\r\nall the fine speeches upon the subject, with which your newspapers are\r\nevery now and then filled, are all mere hocus-pocus and rhodomontade.\r\nHowever, the caldron was soon set on, and the air was darkened by witches\r\nriding on broomsticks, bringing a couple of folios under each arm, and\r\nacross each shoulder. I remember the time exactly: it was just as the\r\ncouncil of Nice had broken up, so that they got books and papers there dog\r\ncheap; but it was a bad thing for the poor English, as these were the worst\r\nmaterials that entered into the caldron. Besides, as the Devil wanted some\r\namusement, and had not seen an account of the transactions of this famous\r\ncouncil, he had all the books brought from it laid before him, and split\r\nhis sides almost {218} with laughing, whilst he was reading the speeches\r\nand decrees of so many of his old friends and acquaintances. All this while\r\nthe witches were depositing their loads in the great caldron. There were\r\nbooks from the Dalai Lama, and from China: there were books from the\r\nHindoos, and tallies from the Caffres: there were paintings from Mexico,\r\nand rocks of hieroglyphics from Egypt: the last country supplied besides\r\nthe swathings of two thousand mummies, and four-fifths of the famed library\r\nof Alexandria. Bubble! bubble! toil and trouble! never was a day of more\r\nlabor and anxiety; and if our good master had but flung in the Greek books\r\nat the proper time, they would have made a complete job of it. He was a\r\nlittle too impatient: as the caldron frothed up, he skimmed it off with a\r\ngreat ladle, and filled some thousands of our wind-bags with the froth,\r\nwhich the English with great joy carried back to their own country. These\r\nbags were sent to every district: the chiefs first took their fill, and\r\nthen the common people; hence they now speak a language which no foreigner\r\ncan understand, unless he has learned half a dozen other languages; and the\r\npoor people, not one in ten, understand a third part of what is said to\r\nthem. The hissing, however, they have not entirely got rid of, and every\r\nseven years, when the Devil, according to agreement, pays them a visit,\r\nthey entertain him at their common halls and county meetings with their\r\noriginal language.\r\n\r\n\"The good-natured old hag told me several other circumstances, relative to\r\nthis curious transaction, which, as there is an Englishman in company, it\r\nwill be prudent to pass over in silence: but I cannot help mentioning one\r\nthing which she told me as a very great secret. You know, says she to me,\r\nthat the English have more religions among them than any other nation in\r\nEurope, and that there is more teaching and sermonizing with them than in\r\nany other country. The fact is this; it matters not who gets up to teach\r\nthem, the hard words of the Greek were not sufficiently {219} boiled, and\r\nwhenever they get into a sentence, the poor people's brains are turned, and\r\nthey know no more what the preacher is talking about, than if he harangued\r\nthem in Arabic. Take my word for it if you please; but if not, when you get\r\nto England, desire the bettermost sort of people that you are acquainted\r\nwith to read to you an act of parliament, which of course is written in the\r\nclearest and plainest style in which anything can be written, and you will\r\nfind that not one in ten will be able to make tolerable sense of it. The\r\nlanguage would have been an excellent language, if it had not been for the\r\ncouncil of Nice, and the words had been well boiled.\r\n\r\n\"Here the company burst out into a fit of laughter. The Englishman got up\r\nand shook hands with the Swede: _si non e vero_, said he, _e ben\r\ntrovato_.[476] But, however I may laugh at it here, I would not advise you\r\nto tell this story on the other side of the water. So here's a bumper to\r\nOld England for ever, and God save the king.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON YOUTHFUL PRODIGIES.\r\n\r\nThe accounts given of extraordinary children and adolescents frequently\r\ndefy credence.[477] I will give two well-attested instances.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated mathematician Alexis Claude Clairault (now Clairaut)[478]\r\nwas certainly born in May, 1713. His treatise on curves of double curvature\r\n(printed in 1731)[479] received {220} the approbation of the Academy of\r\nSciences, August 23, 1729. Fontenelle, in his certificate of this, calls\r\nthe author sixteen years of age, and does not strive to exaggerate the\r\nwonder, as he might have done, by reminding his readers that this work, of\r\noriginal and sustained mathematical investigation, must have been coming\r\nfrom the pen at the ages of fourteen and fifteen. The truth was, as\r\nattested by De Molieres,[480] Clairaut had given public proofs of his power\r\nat twelve years old. His age being thus publicly certified, all doubt is\r\nremoved: say he had been--though great wonder would still have been\r\nleft--twenty-one instead of sixteen, his appearance, and the remembrances\r\nof his friends, schoolfellows, etc., would have made it utterly hopeless to\r\nknock off five years of that age while he was on view in Paris as a young\r\nlion. De Molieres, who examined the work officially for the _Garde des\r\nSceaux_, is transported beyond the bounds of official gravity, and says\r\nthat it \"ne merite pas seulement d'etre imprime, mais d'etre admire comme\r\nun prodige d'imagination, de conception, et de capacite.\"[481]\r\n\r\nThat Blaise Pascal was born in June, 1623, is perfectly well established\r\nand uncontested.[482] That he wrote his conic sections at the age of\r\nsixteen might be difficult to establish, though tolerably well attested, if\r\nit were not for {221} one circumstance, for the book was not published. The\r\ncelebrated theorem, \"Pascal's hexagram,\"[483] makes all the rest come very\r\neasy. Now Curabelle,[484] in a work published in 1644, sneers at\r\nDesargues,[485] whom he quotes, for having, in 1642, deferred a discussion\r\nuntil \"cette grande proposition nommee le Pascale verra le jour.\"[486] That\r\nis, by the time Pascal was nineteen, the _hexagram_ was circulating under a\r\nname derived from the author. The common story about Pascal, given by his\r\nsister,[487] is an absurdity which no doubt has prejudiced many against\r\ntales of early proficiency. He is made, when quite a boy, to invent\r\ngeometry _in the order of Euclid's propositions_: as if that order were\r\nnatural sequence of investigation. The hexagram at ten years old would be a\r\nhundred times less unlikely.\r\n\r\nThe instances named are painfully astonishing: I give one which has fallen\r\nout of sight, because it will preserve an imperfect biography. John\r\nWilson[488] is Wilson of that {222} Ilk, that is, of \"Wilson's Theorem.\" It\r\nis this: if _p_ be a prime number, the product of all the numbers up to\r\n_p_-1, increased by 1, is divisible without remainder by _p_. All\r\nmathematicians know this as Wilson's theorem, but few know who Wilson was.\r\nHe was born August 6, 1741, at the Howe in Applethwaite, and he was heir to\r\na small estate at Troutbeck in Westmoreland. He was sent to Peterhouse, at\r\nCambridge, and while an undergraduate was considered stronger in algebra\r\nthan any one in the University, except Professor Waring, one of the most\r\npowerful algebraists of the century.[489] He was the senior wrangler of\r\n1761, and was then for some time a private tutor. When Paley,[490] then in\r\nhis third year, determined to make a push for the senior wranglership,\r\nwhich he got, Wilson was recommended to him as a tutor. Both were ardent in\r\ntheir work, except that sometimes Paley, when he came for his lesson, would\r\nfind \"Gone a fishing\" written on his tutor's outer door: which was insult\r\nadded to injury, for Paley was very fond of fishing. Wilson soon left\r\nCambridge, and went to the bar. He practised on the northern circuit with\r\ngreat success; and, one day, while passing his vacation on his little\r\nproperty at Troutbeck, he received information, to his great surprise, that\r\nLord Thurlow,[491] with whom he had {223} no acquaintance, had recommended\r\nhim to be a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas. He died, Oct. 18, 1793,\r\nwith a very high reputation as a lawyer and a Judge. These facts are partly\r\nfrom Meadley's _Life of Paley_,[492] no doubt from Paley himself, partly\r\nfrom the _Gentleman's Magazine_, and from an epitaph written by Bishop\r\nWatson.[493] Wilson did not publish anything: the theorem by which he has\r\ncut his name in the theory of numbers was communicated to Waring, by whom\r\nit was published. He married, in 1788, a daughter of Serjeant Adair,[494]\r\nand left issue. _Had a family_, many will say: but a man and his wife are a\r\nfamily, even without children. An actuary may be allowed to be accurate in\r\nthis matter, of which I was reminded by what an actuary wrote of another\r\nactuary. William Morgan,[495] in the life of his uncle Dr. Richard\r\nPrice,[496] says that the Doctor and his {224} wife were \"never blessed\r\nwith an addition to their family.\" I never met with such accuracy\r\nelsewhere. Of William Morgan I add that my surname and pursuits have\r\nsometimes, to my credit be it said, made a confusion between him and me.\r\nDates are nothing to the mistaken; the last three years of Morgan's life\r\nwere the first three years of my actuary-life (1830-33). The mistake was to\r\nmy advantage as well as to my credit. I owe to it the acquaintance of one\r\nof the noblest of the human race, I mean Elizabeth Fry,[497] who came to me\r\nfor advice about a philanthropic design, which involved life questions,\r\nunder a general impression that some Morgan had attended to such\r\nthings.[498]\r\n\r\n{225}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEWTON AGAIN OVERTHROWN.\r\n\r\n    A treatise on the sublime science of heliography, satisfactorily\r\n    demonstrating our great orb of light, the sun, to be absolutely no\r\n    other than a body of ice! Overturning all the received systems of the\r\n    universe hitherto extant; proving the celebrated and indefatigable Sir\r\n    Isaac Newton, in his theory of the solar system, to be as far distant\r\n    from the truth, as many of the heathen authors of Greece and Rome. By\r\n    Charles Palmer,[499] Gent. London, 1798, 8vo.\r\n\r\nMr. Palmer burned some tobacco with a burning glass, saw that a lens of ice\r\nwould do as well, and then says:\r\n\r\n\"If we admit that the sun could be removed, and a terrestrial body of ice\r\nplaced in its stead, it would produce the same effect. The sun is a\r\ncrystaline body receiving the radiance of God, and operates on this earth\r\nin a similar manner as the light of the sun does when applied to a convex\r\nmirror or glass.\"\r\n\r\nNov. 10, 1801. The Rev. Thomas Cormouls,[500] minister of Tettenhall,\r\naddressed a letter to Sir Wm. Herschel, from which I extract the following:\r\n\r\n\"Here it may be asked, then, how came the doctrines of Newton to solve all\r\nastronomic Phenomina, and all problems concerning the same, both _a parte\r\nante_ and _a parte post_.[501] It is answered that he certainly wrought the\r\nprinciples he made use of into strickt analogy with the real Phenomina of\r\nthe heavens, and that the rules and results arizing from them {226} agree\r\nwith them and resolve accurately all questions concerning them. Though they\r\nare not fact and true, or nature, but analogous to it, in the manner of the\r\nartificial numbers of logarithms, sines, &c. A very important question\r\narises here, Did Newton mean to impose upon the world? By no means: he\r\nreceived and used the doctrines reddy formed; he did a little extend and\r\ncontract his principles when wanted, and commit a few oversights of\r\nconsequences. But when he was very much advanced in life, he suspected the\r\nfundamental nullity of them: but I have from a certain anecdote strong\r\nground to believe that he knew it before his decease and intended to have\r\nretracted his error. But, however, somebody did deceive, if not wilfully,\r\nnegligently at least. That was a man to whom the world has great\r\nobligations too. It was no less a philosopher than Galileo.\"\r\n\r\nThat Newton wanted to retract before his death, is a notion not uncommon\r\namong paradoxers. Nevertheless, there is no retraction in the third edition\r\nof the _Principia_, published when Newton was eighty-four years old! The\r\nmoral of the above is, that a gentleman who prefers instructing William\r\nHerschel to learning how to spell, may find a proper niche in a proper\r\nplace, for warning to others. It seems that gravitation is not truth, but\r\nonly the logarithm of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBISHOPS AS PARADOXERS.\r\n\r\n    The mathematical and philosophical works of the Right Rev. John\r\n    Wilkins[502].... In two volumes. London, 1802, 8vo.\r\n\r\nThis work, or at least part of the edition--all for aught I know--is\r\nprinted on wood; that is, on paper made from wood-pulp. It has a rough\r\nsurface; and when held before a candle is of very unequal transparency.\r\nThere is in it a reprint of the works on the earth and moon. The discourse\r\non the possibility of going to the moon, in this and the edition of 1640,\r\nis incorporated: but from the account in the {227} life prefixed, and a\r\nmention by D'Israeli, I should suppose that it had originally a separate\r\ntitle-page, and some circulation as a separate tract. Wilkins treats this\r\nsubject half seriously, half jocosely; he has evidently not quite made up\r\nhis mind. He is clear that \"arts are not yet come to their solstice,\" and\r\nthat posterity will bring hidden things to light. As to the difficulty of\r\ncarrying food, he thinks, scoffing Puritan that he is, the Papists may be\r\ntrained to fast the voyage, or may find the bread of their Eucharist \"serve\r\nwell enough for their _viaticum_.\"[503] He also puts the case that the\r\nstory of Domingo Gonsales may be realized, namely, that wild geese find\r\ntheir way to the moon. It will be remembered--to use the usual substitute\r\nfor, It has been forgotten--that the posthumous work of Bishop Francis\r\nGodwin[504] of Llandaff was published in 1638, the very year of Wilkins's\r\nfirst edition, in time for him to mention it at the end. Godwin makes\r\nDomingo Gonsales get to the moon in a chariot drawn by wild geese, and, as\r\nold books would say, discourses fully on that head. It is not a little\r\namusing that Wilkins should have been seriously accused of plagiarizing\r\nGodwin, Wilkins writing in earnest, or nearly so, and Godwin writing\r\nfiction. It may serve to show philosophers how very near pure speculation\r\ncomes to fable. From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step: which is\r\nthe sublime, and which the ridiculous, every one must settle for himself.\r\nWith me, good fiction is the sublime, and bad speculation the ridiculous.\r\nThe number of bishops in my list is small. I might, had I possessed the\r\nbook, have opened the list of quadrators with an Archbishop of Canterbury,\r\nor at least with a divine who was not wholly not archbishop. Thomas\r\nBradwardine[505] (Bragvardinus, Bragadinus) was elected in {228} 1348; the\r\nPope put in another, who died unconsecrated; and Bradwardine was again\r\nelected in 1349, and lived five weeks longer, dying, I suppose, unconfirmed\r\nand unconsecrated.[506] Leland says he held the see a year, _unus tantum\r\nannulus_,[507] which seems to be a confusion: the whole business, from the\r\nfirst election, took about a year. He squared the circle, and his\r\nperformance was printed at Paris in 1494. I have never seen it, nor any\r\nwork of the author, except a tract on proportion.\r\n\r\nAs Bradwardine's works are very scarce indeed, I give two titles from one\r\nof the Libri catalogues.\r\n\r\n    \"ARITHMETIC.

By Wm. Spence.[522] 4th edition, 1808, 8vo.\r\n\r\nA patriotic paradox, being in alleviation of the Commerce panic which the\r\nmeasures of Napoleon I.--who _felt_ our Commerce, while Mr. Spence only\r\n_saw_ it--had awakened. In this very month (August, 1866), the Pres. Brit.\r\nAssoc. has applied a similar salve to the coal panic; it is fit that\r\nscience, which rubbed the sore, should find a plaster. We ought to have an\r\niron panic and a timber panic; and {232} a solemn embassy to the Americans,\r\nto beg them not to whittle, would be desirable. There was a gold panic\r\nbeginning, before the new fields were discovered. For myself, I am the\r\nunknown and unpitied victim of a chronic gutta-percha panic: I never could\r\nget on without it; to me, gutta percha and Rowland Hill are the great\r\ndiscoveries of our day; and not unconnected either, gutta percha being to\r\nthe submarine post what Rowland Hill is to the superterrene. I should be\r\nsorry to lose cow-choke--I gave up trying to spell it many years ago--but\r\nif gutta percha go, I go too. I think, that perhaps when, five hundred\r\nyears hence, the people say to the Brit. Assoc. (if it then exist) \"Pray\r\ngentlemen, is it not time for the coal to be exhausted?\" they will be\r\nanswered out of Moliere (who will certainly then exist): \"_Cela etait\r\nautrefois ainsi, mais nous avons change tout cela._\"[523] A great many\r\npeople think that if the coal be used up, it will be announced some\r\nunexpected morning by all the yards being shut up and written notice\r\noutside, \"Coal all gone!\" just like the \"Please, ma'am, there ain't no more\r\nsugar,\" with which the maid servant damps her mistress just at\r\nbreakfast-time. But these persons should be informed that there is every\r\nreason to think that there will be time, as the city gentleman said, to\r\n_venienti_ the _occurrite morbo_.[524]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME SCIENTIFIC PARADOXES.\r\n\r\n    An appeal to the republic of letters in behalf of injured science, from\r\n    the opinions and proceedings of some modern authors of elements of\r\n    geometry. By George Douglas.[525] Edinburgh, 1810, 8vo.\r\n\r\nMr. Douglas was the author of a very good set of {233} mathematical tables,\r\nand of other works. He criticizes Simson,[526] Playfair,[527] and\r\nothers,--sometimes, I think, very justly. There is a curious phrase which\r\noccurs more than once. When he wants to say that something or other was\r\ndone before Simson or another was born, he says \"before he existed, at\r\nleast as an author.\" He seems to reserve the possibility of Simson's\r\n_pre-existence_, but at the same time to assume that he never wrote\r\nanything in his previous state. Tell me that Simson pre-existed in any\r\nother way than as editor of some pre-existent Euclid? Tell Apella![528]\r\n\r\n1810. In this year Jean Wood, Professor of Mathematics in the University of\r\nVirginia (Richmond),[529] addressed a printed circular to \"Dr. Herschel,\r\nAstronomer, Greenwich Observatory.\" No mistake was more common than the\r\nnatural one of imagining that the _Private Astronomer_ of the king was the\r\n_Astronomer Royal_. The letter was on the {234} difference of velocities of\r\nthe two sides of the earth, arising from the composition of the rotation\r\nand the orbital motion. The _paradox_ is a fair one, and deserving of\r\ninvestigation; but, perhaps it would not be easy to deduce from it tides,\r\ntrade-winds, aerolithes, &c., as Mr. Wood thought he had done in a work\r\nfrom which he gives an extract, and which he describes as published. The\r\ncomposition of rotations, &c., is not for the world at large: the paradox\r\nof the non-rotation of the moon about her axis is an instance. How many\r\npersons know that when a wheel rolls on the ground, the lowest point is\r\nmoving upwards, the highest point forwards, and the intermediate points in\r\nall degrees of betwixt and between? This is too short an explanation, with\r\nsome good difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Elements of Geometry. In 2 vols. [By the Rev. J. Dobson,[530] B.D.]\r\n    Cambridge, 1815. 4to.\r\n\r\nOf this unpunctuating paradoxer I shall give an account in his own way: he\r\nwould not stop for any one; why should I stop for him? It is worth while to\r\ntry how unpunctuated sentences will read.\r\n\r\nThe reverend J Dobson BD late fellow of saint Johns college Cambridge was\r\nrector of Brandesburton in Yorkshire he was seventh wrangler in 1798 and\r\ndied in 1847 he was of that sort of eccentricity which permits account of\r\nhis private life if we may not rather say that in such cases private life\r\nbecomes public there is a tradition that he was called Death Dobson on\r\naccount of his head and aspect of countenance being not very unlike the\r\nordinary pictures of a human skull his mode of life is reported to have\r\nbeen very singular whenever he visited Cambridge he was never known to go\r\ntwice to the same inn he never would sleep at the rectory with another\r\nperson in the house some ancient charwoman used to attend to the house but\r\nnever slept in it he has been known in the time of coach travelling to have\r\n{235} deferred his return to Yorkshire on account of his disinclination to\r\ntravel with a lady in the coach he continued his mathematical studies until\r\nhis death and till his executors sold the type all his tracts to the number\r\nof five were kept in type at the university press none of these tracts had\r\nany stops except full stops at the end of paragraphs only neither had they\r\ncapitals except one at the beginning of a paragraph so that a full stop was\r\ngenerally followed by some white as there is not a single proper name in\r\nthe whole of the book I have I am not able to say whether he would have\r\nused capitals before proper names I have inserted them as usual for which I\r\nhope his spirit will forgive me if I be wrong he also published the\r\nelements of geometry in two volumes quarto Cambridge 1815 this book had\r\nalso no stops except when a comma was wanted between letters as in the\r\nstraight lines AB, BC I should also say that though the title is\r\nunpunctuated in the author's part it seems the publishers would not stand\r\nit in their imprint this imprint is punctuated as usual and Deighton and\r\nSons to prove the completeness of their allegiance have managed that comma\r\nsemicolon and period shall all appear in it why could they not have\r\ncontrived interrogation and exclamation this is a good precedent to\r\nestablish the separate right of the publisher over the imprint it is said\r\nthat only twenty of the tracts were printed and very few indeed of the book\r\non geometry it is doubtful whether any were sold there is a copy of the\r\ngeometry in the university library at Cambridge and I have one myself the\r\nmatter of the geometry differs entirely from Euclid and is so fearfully\r\nprolix that I am sure no mortal except the author ever read it the man went\r\non without stops and without stop save for a period at the end of a\r\nparagraph this is the unpunctuated account of the unpunctuating geometer\r\n_suum cuique tribuito_[531] Mrs Thrale[532] would have been amused {236} at\r\na Dobson who managed to come to a full stop without either of the three\r\nwarnings.\r\n\r\nI do not find any difficulty in reading Dobson's geometry; and I have read\r\nmore of it to try reading without stops than I should have done had it been\r\nprinted in the usual way. Those who dip into the middle of my paragraph may\r\nbe surprised for a moment to see \"on account of his disinclination to\r\ntravel with a lady in the coach he continued his mathematical studies until\r\nhis death and [further, of course] until his executors sold the type.\" But\r\na person reading straight through would hardly take it so. I should add\r\nthat, in order to give a fair trial, I did not compose as I wrote, but\r\ncopied the words of the correspondent who gave me the facts, so far as they\r\nwent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA RELIGIOUS PARADOX.\r\n\r\n    _Philosophia Sacra, or the principles of natural Philosophy. Extracted\r\n    from Divine Revelation._ By the Rev. Samuel Pike.[533] Edited by the\r\n    Rev. Samuel Kittle.[534] Edinburgh, 1815, 8vo.\r\n\r\nThis is a work of modified Hutchinsonianism, which I have seen cited by\r\nseveral. Though rather dark on the subject, it seems not to contradict the\r\nmotion of the earth, or the doctrine of gravitation. Mr. Kittle gives a\r\nlist of some Hutchinsonians,--as Bishop Horne;[535] Dr. Stukeley;[536] the\r\nRev. {237} W. Jones,[537] author of _Physiological Disquisitions_; Mr.\r\nSpearman,[538] author of _Letters on the Septuagint_ and editor of\r\nHutchinson; Mr. Barker,[539] author of _Reflexions on Learning_; Dr.\r\nCatcott,[540] author of a work on the creation, &c.; Dr. Robertson,[541]\r\nauthor of a _Treatise on the Hebrew Language_; _Dr. Holloway_,[542] author\r\nof _Originals, Physical and Theological_; Dr. Walter Hodges,[543] author of\r\na work on _Elohim_; Lord President Forbes (_ob._ 1747).[544]\r\n\r\nThe Rev. William Jones, above mentioned (1726-1800), the friend and\r\nbiographer of Bishop Horne and his stout {238} defender, is best known as\r\nWilliam Jones of Nayland, who (1757)[545] published the _Catholic Doctrine\r\nof the Trinity_; he was also strong for the Hutchinsonian physical trinity\r\nof fire, light, and spirit. This well-known work was generally recommended,\r\nas the defence of the orthodox system, to those who could not go into the\r\nlearning of the subject. There is now a work more suited to our time: _The\r\nRock of Ages_, by the Rev. E. H. Bickersteth,[546] now published by the\r\nReligious Tract Society, without date, answered by the Rev. Dr.\r\nSadler,[547] in a work (1859) entitled _Gloria Patri_, in which, says Mr.\r\nBickersteth, \"the author has not even attempted to grapple with my main\r\npropositions.\" I have read largely on the controversy, and I think I know\r\nwhat this means. Moreover, when I see the note \"There are two other\r\npassages to which Unitarians sometimes refer, but the deduction they draw\r\nfrom them is, in each case, refuted by the context\"--I think I see why the\r\ntwo texts are not named. Nevertheless, the author is a little more disposed\r\nto yield to criticism than his foregoers; he does not insist on texts and\r\nreadings which the greatest editors have rejected. And he writes with\r\ncourtesy, both direct and oblique, towards his antagonists; which, on his\r\nside of this subject, is like letting in fresh air. So that I suspect the\r\ntwo books will together make a tolerably good introduction to the subject\r\nfor those who cannot go deep. Mr. Bickersteth's book is well arranged and\r\nindexed, which is a point of superiority to Jones of Nayland. There is a\r\npoint which I should gravely recommend to writers on the orthodox side. The\r\nUnitarians in {239} England have frequently contended that the method of\r\nproving the divinity of Jesus Christ from the New Testament would equally\r\nprove the divinity of Moses. I have not fallen in the way of any orthodox\r\nanswers specially directed at the repeated tracts written by Unitarians in\r\nproof of their assertion. If there be any, they should be more known; if\r\nthere be none, some should be written. Which ever side may be right, the\r\ntreatment of this point would be indeed coming to close quarters. The\r\nheterodox assertion was first supported, it is said, by John Bidle or\r\nBiddle (1615-1662) of Magdalen College, Oxford, the earliest of the English\r\nUnitarian writers, previously known by a translation of part of Virgil and\r\npart of Juvenal.[548] But I cannot find that he wrote on it.[549] It is the\r\nsubject of \"[Greek: haireseon anastasis], or a new way of deciding old\r\ncontroversies. By Basanistes. Third edition, enlarged,\" London, 1815,\r\n8vo.[550] It is the appendix to the amusing, \"Six more letters to Granville\r\nSharp, Esq., ... By Gregory Blunt, Esq.\" London, 8vo., 1803.[551] This much\r\nI can confidently say, that the study of these tracts would prevent\r\northodox writers from some curious slips, which are slips obvious to all\r\nsides of opinion. The lower defenders of orthodoxy frequently vex the\r\nspirits of the higher ones.\r\n\r\nSince writing the above I have procured Dr. Sadler's answer. I thought I\r\nknew what the challenger meant when he said the respondent had not grappled\r\nwith his main {240} propositions. I should say that he is clung on to from\r\nbeginning to end. But perhaps Mr. B. has his own meaning of logical terms,\r\nsuch as \"proposition\": he certainly has his own meaning of \"cumulative.\" He\r\nsays his evidence is cumulative; not a catena, the strength of which is in\r\nits weakest part, but distinct and independent lines, each of which\r\ncorroborates the other. This is the very opposite of _cumulative_: it is\r\n_distributive_. When different arguments are each necessary to a\r\nconclusion, the evidence is _cumulative_; when any one will do, even though\r\nthey strengthen each other, it is _distributive_. The word \"cumulative\" is\r\na synonym of the law word \"constructive\"; a whole which will do made out of\r\nparts which separately will not. Lord Strafford [552] opens his defence\r\nwith the use of both words: \"They have invented a kind of _accumulated_ or\r\n_constructive_ evidence; by which many actions, either totally innocent in\r\nthemselves, or criminal in a much inferior degree, shall, when united,\r\n_amount_ to treason.\" The conclusion is, that Mr. B. is a Cambridge man;\r\nthe Oxford men do not confuse the elementary terms of logic. O dear old\r\nCambridge! when the New Zealander comes let him find among the relics of\r\nyour later sons some proof of attention to the elementary laws of thought.\r\nA little-go of logic, please!\r\n\r\nMr. B., though apparently not a Hutchinsonian, has a nibble at a physical\r\nTrinity. \"If, as we gaze on the sun shining in the firmament, we see any\r\nfaint adumbration of the doctrine of the Trinity in the fontal orb, the\r\nlight ever generated, and the heat proceeding from the sun and its\r\nbeams--threefold and yet one, the sun, its light, and its {241} heat,--that\r\nluminous globe, and the radiance ever flowing from it, are both evident to\r\nthe eye; but the vital warmth is felt, not seen, and is only manifested in\r\nthe life it transfuses through creation. The proof of its real existence is\r\nself-demonstrating.\"\r\n\r\nWe shall see how Revilo[553] illustrates orthodoxy by mathematics. It was\r\nmy duty to have found one of the many illustrations from physics; but\r\nperhaps I should have forgotten it if this instance had not come in my way.\r\nIt is very bad physics. The sun, apart from its light, evident to the eye!\r\nHeat more self-demonstrating than light, because _felt_! Heat only\r\nmanifested by the life it diffuses! Light implied not necessary to life!\r\nBut the theology is worse than Sabellianism[554]. To adumbrate--i.e., make\r\na picture of--the orthodox doctrine, the sun must be heavenly body, the\r\nlight heavenly body, the heat heavenly body; and yet, not three heavenly\r\nbodies, but one heavenly body. The truth is, that this illustration and\r\nmany others most strikingly illustrate the Trinity of fundamental doctrine\r\nheld by the Unitarians, in all its differences from the Trinity of persons\r\nheld by the Orthodox. Be right which may, the right or wrong of the\r\nUnitarians shines out in the comparison. Dr. Sadler confirms me--by which I\r\nmean that I wrote the above before I saw what he says--in the following\r\nwords: \"The sun is one object with two _properties_, and these properties\r\nhave a parallel not in the second and third persons of the Trinity, but in\r\nthe attributes of Deity.\"\r\n\r\nThe letting light alone, as self-evident, and making heat\r\nself-demonstrating, because felt--i.e., perceptible now and then--has the\r\ncharacter of the Irishman's astronomy:\r\n\r\n{242}\r\n\r\n \"Long life to the moon, for a dear noble cratur,\r\n  Which serves us for lamplight all night in the dark,\r\n  While the sun only shines in the day, which by natur,\r\n  Wants no light at all, as ye all may remark.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR RICHARD PHILLIPS.\r\n\r\n_Sir Richard Phillips_[555] (born 1768) was conspicuous in 1793, when he\r\nwas sentenced to a year's imprisonment[556] for selling Paine's _Rights of\r\nMan_; and again when, in 1807[557], he was knighted as Sheriff of London.\r\nAs a bookseller, he was able to enforce his opinions in more ways than\r\nothers. For instance, in James Mitchell's[558] _Dictionary of the\r\nMathematical and Physical Sciences_, 1823, 12mo, which, though he was not\r\ntechnically a publisher, was printed for him--a book I should recommend to\r\nthe collector of works of reference--there is a temperate description of\r\nhis doctrines, which one may almost swear was one of his conditions\r\nprevious to undertaking the work. Phillips himself was not only an\r\nanti-Newtonian, but carried to a fearful excess the notion that statesmen\r\nand Newtonians were in league to deceive the world. He saw this plot in\r\nMrs. Airy's[559] pension, and in Mrs. Somerville's[560]. In 1836, he {243}\r\ndid me the honor to attempt my conversion. In his first letter he says:\r\n\r\n\"Sir Richard Phillips has an inveterate abhorrence of all the pretended\r\nwisdom of philosophy derived from the monks and doctors of the middle ages,\r\nand not less of those of higher name who merely sought to make the monkish\r\nphilosophy more plausible, or so to disguise it as to mystify the mob of\r\nsmall thinkers.\"\r\n\r\nSo little did his writings show any knowledge of antiquity, that I strongly\r\nsuspect, if required to name one of the monkish doctors, he would have\r\nanswered--Aristotle. These schoolmen, and the \"philosophical trinity of\r\ngravitating force, projectile force, and void space,\" were the bogies of\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\nI think he began to publish speculations in the _Monthly Magazine_ (of\r\nwhich he was editor) in July 1817: these he republished separately in 1818.\r\nIn the Preface, perhaps judging the feelings of others by his own, he says\r\nthat he \"fully expects to be vilified, reviled, and anathematized, for many\r\nyears to come.\" Poor man! he was let alone. He appeals with confidence to\r\nthe \"impartial decision of posterity\"; but posterity does not appoint a\r\nhearing for one per cent. of the appeals which are made; and it is much to\r\nbe feared that an article in such a work of reference as this will furnish\r\nnearly all her materials fifty years hence. The following, addressed to M.\r\nArago,[561] in 1835, will give posterity as good a notion as she will\r\nprobably need:\r\n\r\n\"Even the present year has afforded EVER-MEMORABLE examples, paralleled\r\nonly by that of the Romish Conclave which persecuted Galileo. Policy has\r\nadopted that maxim of Machiavel which teaches that it is _more prudent_ to\r\n_reward_ {244} partisans than to _persecute_ opponents. Hence, a bigotted\r\nparty had influence enough with the late short-lived administration [I\r\nthink he is wrong as to the administration] of Wellington, Peel, &c., to\r\nconfer munificent royal pensions on three writers whose sole distinction\r\nwas their advocacy of the Newtonian philosophy. A Cambridge professor last\r\nyear published an elaborate volume in illustration of _Gravitation_, and on\r\nhim has been conferred a pension of 300l. per annum. A lady has written a\r\nlight popular view of the Newtonian Dogmas, and she has been complimented\r\nby a pension of 200l. per annum. And another writer, who has recently\r\npublished a volume to prove that the only true philosophy is that of Moses,\r\nhas been endowed with a pension of 200l. per annum. Neither of them were\r\nneedy persons, and the political and ecclesiastical bearing of the whole\r\nwas indicated by another pension of 300l. bestowed on a political writer,\r\nthe advocate of all abuses and prejudices. Whether the conduct of the\r\nRomish Conclave was more base for visiting with legal penalties the\r\npromulgation of the doctrines that the Earth turns on its axis and revolves\r\naround the Sun; or that of the British Court, for its craft in conferring\r\npensions on the opponents of the plain corollary, that all the motions of\r\nthe Earth are 'part and parcel' of these great motions, and those again and\r\nall like them consecutive displays of still greater motions in equality of\r\naction and reaction, is A QUESTION which must be reserved for the casuists\r\nof other generations.... I cannot expect that on a sudden you and your\r\nfriends will come to my conclusion, that the present philosophy of the\r\nSchools and Universities of Europe, based on faith in witchcraft, magic,\r\n&c., is a system of execrable nonsense, _by which quacks live on the faith\r\nof fools_; but I desire a free and fair examination of my Aphorisms, and if\r\na few are admitted to be true, merely as courteous concessions to\r\narithmetic, my purpose will be effected, for men will thus be led to think;\r\nand if they think, then the fabric {245} of false assumptions, and\r\ndegrading superstitions will soon tumble in ruins.\"\r\n\r\nThis for posterity. For the present time I ground the fame of Sir R.\r\nPhillips on his having squared the circle without knowing it, or intending\r\nto do it. In the _Protest_ presently noted he discovered that \"the force\r\ntaken as 1 is equal to the sum of all its fractions ... thus 1 = 1/4 + 1/9\r\n+ 1/16 + 1/25, &c., carried to infinity.\" This the mathematician instantly\r\nsees is equivalent to the theorem that the circumference of any circle is\r\ndouble of the diagonal of the cube on its diameter.[562]\r\n\r\nI have examined the following works of Sir R. Phillips, and heard of many\r\nothers:\r\n\r\n    Essays on the proximate mechanical causes of the general phenomena of\r\n    the Universe, 1818, 12mo.[563]\r\n\r\n    Protest against the prevailing principles of natural philosophy, with\r\n    the development of a common sense system (no date, 8vo, pp. 16).[564]\r\n\r\n    Four dialogues between an Oxford Tutor and a disciple of the\r\n    common-sense philosophy, relative to the proximate causes of material\r\n    phenomena. 8vo, 1824.\r\n\r\n    A century of original aphorisms on the proximate causes of the\r\n    phenomena of nature, 1835, 12mo.\r\n\r\nSir Richard Phillips had four valuable qualities; honesty, zeal, ability,\r\nand courage. He applied them all to teaching {246} matters about which he\r\nknew nothing; and gained himself an uncomfortable life and a ridiculous\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Astronomy made plain; or only way the true perpendicular distance of\r\n    the Sun, Moon, or Stars, from this earth, can be obtained. By Wm.\r\n    Wood.[565] Chatham, 1819, 12mo.\r\n\r\nIf this theory be true, it will follow, of course, that this earth is the\r\nonly one God made, and that it does not whirl round the sun, but _vice\r\nversa_, the sun round it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHATELY'S FAMOUS PARADOX.\r\n\r\n    Historic doubts relative to Napoleon Buonaparte. London, 1819, 8vo.\r\n\r\nThis tract has since been acknowledged by Archbishop Whately[566] and\r\nreprinted. It is certainly a paradox: but differs from most of those in my\r\nlist as being a joke, and a satire upon the reasoning of those who cannot\r\nreceive narrative, no matter what the evidence, which is to them utterly\r\nimprobable _a priori_. But had it been serious earnest, it would not have\r\nbeen so absurd as many of those which I have brought forward. The next on\r\nthe list is not a joke.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the satire is not new. Dr. King,[567] in the dispute on the\r\ngenuineness of Phalaris, proved with humor that Bentley did not write his\r\nown dissertation. An attempt has lately been made, for the honor of Moses,\r\nto prove, {247} without humor, that Bishop Colenso did not write his own\r\nbook. This is intolerable: anybody who tries to use such a weapon without\r\nbanter, plenty and good, and of form suited to the subject, should get the\r\ndrubbing which the poor man got in the Oriental tale for striking the\r\ndervishes with the wrong hand.\r\n\r\nThe excellent and distinguished author of this tract has ceased to live. I\r\ncall him the Paley of our day: with more learning and more purpose than his\r\npredecessor; but perhaps they might have changed places if they had changed\r\ncenturies. The clever satire above named is not the only work which he\r\npublished without his name. The following was attributed to him, I believe\r\nrightly: \"Considerations on the Law of Libel, as relating to Publications\r\non the subject of Religion, by John Search.\" London, 1833, 8vo. This tract\r\nexcited little attention: for those who should have answered, could not.\r\nMoreover, it wanted a prosecution to call attention to it: the fear of\r\ncalling such attention may have prevented prosecutions. Those who have read\r\nit will have seen why.\r\n\r\nThe theological review elsewhere mentioned attributes the pamphlet of John\r\nSearch on blasphemous libel to Lord Brougham. This is quite absurd: the\r\nwriter states points of law on credence where the judge must have spoken\r\nwith authority. Besides which, a hundred points of style are decisive\r\nbetween the two. I think any one who knows Whately's writing will soon\r\narrive at my conclusion. Lord Brougham himself informs me that he has no\r\nknowledge whatever of the pamphlet.\r\n\r\nIt is stated in _Notes and Queries_ (3 S. xi. 511) that Search was answered\r\nby the Bishop of Ferns[568] as S. N., with {248} a rejoinder by Blanco\r\nWhite.[569] These circumstances increase the probability that Whately was\r\nwritten against and for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    VOLTAIRE A CHRISTIAN.\r\n\r\n    Voltaire Chretien; preuves tirees de ses ouvrages. Paris, 1820, 12mo.\r\n\r\nIf Voltaire have not succeeded in proving himself a strong theist and a\r\nstrong anti-revelationist, who is to succeed in proving himself one thing\r\nor the other in any matter whatsoever? By occasional confusion between\r\ntheism and Christianity; by taking advantage of the formal phrases of\r\nadhesion to the Roman Church, which very often occur, and are often the\r\nhappiest bits of irony in an ironical production; by citations of his\r\nmorality, which is decidedly Christian, though often attributed to\r\nBrahmins; and so on--the author makes a fair case for his paradox, in the\r\neyes of those who know no more than he tells them. If he had said that\r\nVoltaire was a better Christian than himself knew of, towards all mankind\r\nexcept men of letters, I for one should have agreed with him.\r\n\r\n_Christian!_ the word has degenerated into a synonym of _man_, in what are\r\ncalled Christian countries. So we have the parrot who \"swore for all the\r\nworld like a Christian,\" and the two dogs who \"hated each other just like\r\nChristians.\" When the Irish duellist of the last century, whose name may be\r\nspared in consideration of its historic fame {249} and the worthy people\r\nwho bear it, was (June 12, 1786) about to take the consequence of his last\r\nbrutal murder, the rope broke, and the criminal got up, and exclaimed, \"By\r\n---- Mr. Sheriff, you ought to be ashamed of yourself! this rope is not\r\nstrong enough to hang a dog, far less a Christian!\" But such things as this\r\nare far from the worst depravations. As to a word so defiled by usage, it\r\nis well to know that there is a way of escape from it, without renouncing\r\nthe New Testament. I suppose any one may assume for himself what I have\r\nsometimes heard contended for, that no New Testament word is to be used in\r\nreligion in any sense except that of the New Testament. This granted, the\r\nquestion is settled. The word _Christian_, which occurs three times, is\r\nnever recognized as anything but a term of contempt from those without the\r\npale to those within. Thus, Herod Agrippa, who was deep in Jewish\r\nliterature, and a correspondent of Josephus, says to Paul (Acts xxvi. 28),\r\n\"Almost thou persuadest me to be (what I and other followers of the state\r\nreligion despise under the name) a Christian.\" Again (Acts xi. 26), \"The\r\ndisciples (as they called _themselves_) were called (by the surrounding\r\nheathens) Christians first in Antioch.\" Thirdly (1 Peter iv. 16), \"Let none\r\nof you suffer as a _murderer_.... But if as a _Christian_ (as the heathen\r\ncall it by whom the suffering comes), let him not be ashamed.\" That is to\r\nsay, no _disciple_ ever called _himself_ a Christian, or applied the name,\r\nas from himself, to another disciple, from one end of the New Testament to\r\nthe other; and no disciple need apply that name to himself in our day, if\r\nhe dislike the associations with which the conduct of Christians has\r\nclothed it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWRONSKI ON THE LONGITUDE PROBLEM.\r\n\r\n    Address of M. Hoene Wronski to the British Board of Longitude, upon the\r\n    actual state of the mathematics, their reform, {250} and upon the new\r\n    celestial mechanics, giving the definitive solution of the problem of\r\n    longitude.[570] London, 1820, 8vo.\r\n\r\nM. Wronski[571] was the author of seven quartos on mathematics, showing\r\nvery great power of generalization. He was also deep in the transcendental\r\nphilosophy,[572] and had the Absolute at his fingers' ends. All this\r\nknowledge was rendered useless by a persuasion that he had greatly advanced\r\nbeyond the whole world, with many hints that the Absolute would not be\r\nforthcoming, unless prepaid. He was a man of the widest extremes. At one\r\ntime he desired people to see all possible mathematics in\r\n\r\n  F_x_ = A_{0}[Omega]_{0} + A_{1}[Omega]_{1} + A_{2}[Omega]_{2} +\r\n      A_{3}[Omega]_{3} + &c.\r\n\r\nwhich he did not explain, though there is meaning to it in the quartos. At\r\nanother time he was proposing the general solution of the[573] fifth degree\r\nby help of 625 independent equations of one form and 125 of another. The\r\nfirst separate memoir from any Transactions that I ever possessed was given\r\nto me when at Cambridge; the refutation (1819) of this asserted solution,\r\npresented to the Academy of Lisbon by Evangelista Torriano. I cannot say I\r\nread it. The tract above is an attack on modern mathematicians in general,\r\nand on the Board of Longitude, and Dr. Young.[574]\r\n\r\n{251}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. MILNER'S PARADOXES.\r\n\r\n1820. In this year died Dr. Isaac Milner,[575] President of Queens'\r\nCollege, Cambridge, one of the class of rational paradoxers. Under this\r\nname I include all who, in private life, and in matters which concern\r\nthemselves, take their own course, and suit their own notions, no matter\r\nwhat other people may think of them. These men will put things to uses they\r\nwere never intended for, to the great distress and disgust of their\r\ngregarious friends. I am one of the class, and I could write a little book\r\nof cases in which I have incurred absolute reproach for not \"doing as other\r\npeople do.\" I will name two of my atrocities: I took one of those\r\nbutter-dishes which have for a top a dome with holes in it, which is turned\r\ninward, out of reach of accident, when not in use. Turning the dome\r\ninwards, I filled the dish with water, and put a sponge in the dome: the\r\nholes let it fill with water, and I had a penwiper, always moist, and worth\r\nits price five times over. \"Why! what do you mean? It was made to hold\r\nbutter. You are always at some queer thing or other!\" I bought a leaden\r\ncomb, intended to dye the hair, it being supposed that the application of\r\nlead will have this effect. I did not try: but I divided the comb into two,\r\nseparated the part of closed prongs from the other; and thus I had two\r\nruling machines. The lead marks paper, and by drawing the end of one of the\r\nmachines along a ruler, I could rule twenty lines at a time, quite fit to\r\nwrite on. I thought I should have killed a friend to whom I explained it:\r\nhe could not for the life of him understand how leaden _lines_ on paper\r\nwould dye the hair.\r\n\r\nBut Dr. Milner went beyond me. He wanted a seat suited to his shape, and he\r\ndefied opinion to a fearful point. {252} He spread a thick block of putty\r\nover a wooden chair and sat in it until it had taken a ceroplast copy of\r\nthe proper seat. This he gave to a carpenter to be imitated in wood. One of\r\nthe few now living who knew him--my friend, General Perronet\r\nThompson[576]--answers for the wood, which was shown him by Milner himself;\r\nbut he does not vouch for the material being putty, which was in the story\r\ntold me at Cambridge; William Frend[577] also remembered it. Perhaps the\r\nDoctor took off his great seal in green wax, like the Crown; but some soft\r\nmaterial he certainly adopted; and very comfortable he found the wooden\r\ncopy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe same gentleman vouches for Milner's lamp: but this had visible\r\n_science_ in it; the vulgar see no science in the construction of the\r\nchair. A hollow semi-cylinder, but not with a circular curve, revolved on\r\npivots. The curve was calculated on the law that, whatever quantity of oil\r\nmight be in the lamp, the position of equilibrium just brought the oil up\r\nto the edge of the cylinder, at which a bit of wick was placed. As the wick\r\nexhausted the oil, the cylinder slowly revolved about the pivots so as to\r\nkeep the oil always touching the wick.\r\n\r\nGreat discoveries are always laughed at; but it is very often not the laugh\r\nof incredulity; it is a mode of distorting the sense of inferiority into a\r\nsense of superiority, or a mimicry of superiority interposed between the\r\nlaugher and his feeling of inferiority. Two persons in conversation {253}\r\nagreed that it was often a nuisance not to be able to lay hands on a bit of\r\npaper to mark the place in a book, every bit of paper on the table was sure\r\nto contain something not to be spared. I very quietly said that I always\r\nhad a stock of bookmarkers ready cut, with a proper place for them: my\r\nreaders owe many of my anecdotes to this absurd practice. My two\r\ncolloquials burst into a fit of laughter; about what? Incredulity was out\r\nof the question; and there could be nothing foolish in my taking measures\r\nto avoid what they knew was an inconvenience. I was in this matter\r\nobviously their superior, and so they laughed at me. Much more candid was\r\nthe Royal Duke of the last century, who was noted for slow ideas. \"The rain\r\ncomes into my mouth,\" said he, while riding. \"Had not your Royal Highness\r\nbetter shut your mouth?\" said the equerry. The Prince did so, and ought, by\r\nrule, to have laughed heartily at his adviser; instead of this, he said\r\nquietly, \"It doesn't come in now.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERBART'S MATHEMATICAL PSYCHOLOGY.\r\n\r\n    De Attentionis mensura causisque primariis. By J. F. Herbart.[578]\r\n    Koenigsberg, 1822, 4to.\r\n\r\n{254}\r\n\r\nThis celebrated philosopher maintained that mathematics ought to be applied\r\nto psychology, in a separate tract, published also in 1822: the one above\r\nseems, therefore, to be his challenge on the subject. It is on _attention_,\r\nand I think it will hardly support Herbart's thesis. As a specimen of his\r\nformula, let _t_ be the time elapsed since the consideration began, [beta]\r\nthe whole perceptive intensity of the individual, [phi] the whole of his\r\nmental force, and _z_ the force given to a notion by attention during the\r\ntime _t_. Then,\r\n\r\nz = [phi] (1 - [epsilon]^{-[beta]t})\r\n\r\nNow for a test. There is a _jactura_, _v_, the meaning of which I do not\r\ncomprehend. If there be anything in it, my mathematical readers ought to\r\ninterpret it from the formula\r\n\r\n_v_ = [pi][phi][beta]/(1 - [beta])[epsilon]^{-[beta]t} + C[epsilon]^{-t}\r\n\r\nand to this task I leave them, wishing them better luck than mine. The time\r\nmay come when other manifestations of mind, besides _belief_, shall be\r\nsubmitted to calculation: at that time, should it arrive, a final decision\r\nmay be passed upon Herbart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE WHIZGIG.\r\n\r\n    The theory of the Whizgig considered; in as much as it mechanically\r\n    exemplifies the three working properties of nature; which are now set\r\n    forth under the guise of this toy, for children of all ages. London,\r\n    1822, 12mo (pp. 24, B. McMillan, Bow Street, Covent Garden).\r\n\r\nThe toy called the _whizgig_ will be remembered by many. The writer is a\r\nfollower of Jacob Behmen,[579] William Law,[580] {255} Richard Clarke,[581]\r\nand Eugenius Philalethes.[582] Jacob Behmen first announced the three\r\nworking properties of nature, which Newton stole, as described in the\r\n_Gentleman's Magazine_, July, 1782, p. 329. These laws are illustrated in\r\nthe whizgig. There is the harsh astringent, attractive compression; the\r\nbitter compunction, repulsive expansion; and the stinging anguish, duplex\r\nmotion. The author hints that he has written other works, to which he gives\r\nno clue. I have heard that Behmen was pillaged by Newton, and\r\nSwedenborg[583] by Laplace,[584] and Pythagoras by Copernicus,[585] and\r\nEpicurus by Dalton,[586] &c. I do not think this mention will revive\r\nBehmen; but it may the whizgig, a very pretty toy, and philosophical\r\nwithal, for few of those who used it could explain it.\r\n\r\n{256}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME MYTHOLOGICAL PARADOXES.\r\n\r\n    A Grammar of infinite forms; or the mathematical elements of ancient\r\n    philosophy and mythology.

[This is\r\n    pp. 97-180 of some other work, being all I have seen.]\r\n\r\nThese works are all by Sampson Arnold Mackey,[588] for whom see _Notes and\r\nQueries_, 1st S. viii. 468, 565, ix. 89, 179. Had it not been for actual\r\nquotations given by one correspondent only (1st S. viii. 565), that journal\r\nwould have handed him down as a man of some real learning. An extraordinary\r\nman he certainly was: it is not one illiterate shoemaker in a thousand who\r\ncould work upon such a singular mass of Sanskrit and Greek words, without\r\nshowing {257} evidence of being able to read a line in any language but his\r\nown, or to spell that correctly. He was an uneducated Godfrey Higgins.[589]\r\nA few extracts will put this in a strong light: one for history of science,\r\none for astronomy, and one for philology:\r\n\r\n\"Sir Isaac Newton was of opinion that 'the atmosphere of the earth was the\r\nsensory of God; by which he was enabled to see quite round the earth:'\r\nwhich proves that Sir Isaac had no idea that God could see through the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\"Sir Richard [Phillips] has given the most rational explanation of the\r\ncause of the earth's elliptical orbit that I have ever seen in print. It is\r\nbecause the earth presents its watery hemisphere to the sun at one time and\r\nthat of solid land the other; but why has he made his Oxonian astonished at\r\nthe coincidence? It is what I taught in my attic twelve years before.\r\n\r\n\"Again, admitting that the Eloim were powerful and intelligent beings that\r\nmanaged these things, we would accuse _them_ of being the authors of all\r\nthe sufferings of Chrisna. And as they and the constellation of Leo were\r\nbelow the horizon, and consequently cut off from the end of the zodiac,\r\nthere were but eleven constellations of the zodiac to be seen; the three at\r\nthe end were wanted, but those three would be accused of bringing Chrisna\r\ninto the troubles which at last ended in his death. All this would be\r\nexpressed in the Eastern language by saying that Chrisna was persecuted by\r\nthose Judoth Ishcarioth!!!!! [the five notes of exclamation are the\r\nauthor's]. But the astronomy of those distant ages, when the sun was at the\r\nsouth pole in winter, would leave five of those Decans cut off from our\r\nview, in the latitude of twenty-eight degrees; hence Chrisna died of {258}\r\nwounds from five Decans, but the whole five may be included in Judoth\r\nIshcarioth! for the phrase means 'the men that are wanted at the extreme\r\nparts.' Ishcarioth is a compound of _ish_, a man, and _carat_ wanted or\r\ntaken away, and oth the plural termination, more ancient than _im_....\"\r\n\r\nI might show at length how Michael is the sun, and the D'-ev-'l in French\r\nDi-ob-al, also 'L-evi-ath-an--the evi being the radical part both of\r\nd_evi_l and l_evi_athan--is the Nile, which the sun dried up for Moses to\r\npass: a battle celebrated by Jude. Also how _Moses_, the same name as\r\n_Muses_, is from _mesha_, drawn out of the water, \"and hence we called our\r\nland which is saved from the water by the name of _marsh_.\" But it will be\r\nof more use to collect the character of S. A. M. from such correspondents\r\nof _Notes and Queries_ as have written after superficial examination. Great\r\nastronomical and philological attainments, much ability and learning; had\r\nevidently read and studied deeply; remarkable for the originality of his\r\nviews upon the very abstruse subject of mythological astronomy, in which he\r\nexhibited great sagacity. Certainly his views were _original_; but their\r\nsagacity, if it be allowable to copy his own mode of etymologizing, is of\r\nan _ori-gin-ale_ cast, resembling that of a person who puts to his mouth\r\nliquors both distilled and fermented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA KANTESIAN JEWELER.\r\n\r\n    Principles of the Kantesian, or transcendental philosophy. By Thomas\r\n    Wirgman.[590] London, 1824, 8vo.\r\n\r\nMr. Wirgman's mind was somewhat attuned to psychology; but he was cracky\r\nand vagarious. He had been a fashionable jeweler in St. James's Street, no\r\ndoubt the son or grandson of Wirgman at \"the well-known toy-shop in {259}\r\nSt. James's Street,\" where Sam Johnson smartened himself with silver\r\nbuckles. (Boswell, _aet._ 69). He would not have the ridiculous large ones\r\nin fashion; and he would give no more than a guinea a pair; such, says\r\nBoswell, in Italics, were the _principles_ of the business: and I think\r\nthis may be the first place in which the philosophical word was brought\r\ndown from heaven to mix with men. However this may be, _my_ Wirgman sold\r\nsnuff-boxes, among other things, and fifty years ago a fashionable\r\nsnuff-boxer would be under inducement, if not positively obliged, to have a\r\nstock with very objectionable pictures. So it happened that Wirgman--by\r\nreason of a trifle too much candor--came under the notice of the\r\n_Suppression_ Society, and ran considerable risk. Mr. Brougham was his\r\ncounsel; and managed to get him acquitted. Years and years after this, when\r\nMr. Brougham was deep in the formation of the London University (now\r\nUniversity College), Mr. Wirgman called on him. \"What now?\" said Mr. B.\r\nwith his most sarcastic look--a very perfect thing of its kind--\"you're in\r\na scrape again, I suppose!\" \"No! indeed!\" said W., \"my present object is to\r\nask your interest for the chair of Moral Philosophy in the new University!\"\r\nHe had taken up Kant!\r\n\r\nMr. Wirgman, an itinerant paradoxer, called on me in 1831: he came to\r\nconvert me. \"I assure you,\" said he, \"I am nothing but an old brute of a\r\njeweler;\" and his eye and manner were of the extreme of jocosity, as good\r\nin their way, as the satire of his former counsel. I mention him as one of\r\nthat class who go away quite satisfied that they have wrought conviction.\r\n\"Now,\" said he, \"I'll make it clear to you! Suppose a number of gold-fishes\r\nin a glass bowl,--you understand? Well! I come with my cigar and go puff,\r\npuff, puff, over the bowl, until there is a little cloud of smoke: now,\r\ntell me, what will the gold-fishes say to that?\" \"I should imagine,\" said\r\nI, \"That they would not know what to make of it.\" \"By Jove! you're a\r\nKantian;\" said he, and with this and the like, he left me, vowing that\r\n{260} it was delightful to talk to so intelligent a person. The greatest\r\ncompliment Wirgman ever received was from James Mill, who used to say he\r\ndid not _understand_ Kant. That such a man as Mill should think this worth\r\nsaying is a feather in the cap of the jocose jeweler.\r\n\r\nSome of my readers will stare at my supposing that Boswell may have been\r\nthe first down-bringer of the word _principles_ into common life; the best\r\nanswer will be a prior instance of the word as true vernacular; it has\r\nnever happened to me to notice one. Many words have very common uses which\r\nare not old. Take the following from Nichols (_Anecd._ ix. 263): \"Lord\r\nThurlow presents his best respects to Mr. and Mrs. Thicknesse, and assures\r\nthem that he knows of no cause to complain of any part of Mr. Thicknesse's\r\ncarriage; least of all the circumstance of sending the head to Ormond\r\nStreet.\" Surely Mr. T. had lent Lord T. a satisfactory carriage with a\r\nmovable head, and the above is a polite answer to inquiries. Not a bit of\r\nit! _carriage_ is here _conduct_, and the _head_ is a _bust_. The vehicles\r\nof the rich, at the time, were coaches, chariots, chaises, etc., never\r\ncarriages, which were rather _carts_. Gibbon has the word for\r\nbaggage-wagons. In Jane Austen's novels the word carriage is established.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWALSH'S DELUSIONS.\r\n\r\n_John Walsh_,[591] of Cork (1786-1847). This discoverer has had the honor\r\nof a biography from Professor Boole, who, at my request, collected\r\ninformation about him on the scene of his labors. It is in the\r\n_Philosophical Magazine_ for November, 1851, and will, I hope, be\r\ntransferred to some biographical collection where it may find a larger\r\nclass of readers. It is the best biography of a single hero of the kind\r\nthat I know. Mr. Walsh introduced himself to me, {261} as he did to many\r\nothers, in the anterowlandian days of the Post-office; his unpaid letters\r\nwere double, treble, &c. They contained his pamphlets, and cost their\r\nweight in silver: all have the name of the author, and all are in octavo or\r\nin quarto letter-form: most are in four pages, and all dated from Cork. I\r\nhave the following by me:\r\n\r\n    The Geometric Base, 1825.--The theory of plane angles. 1827.--Three\r\n    Letters to Dr. Francis Sadleir. 1838.--The invention of polar geometry.\r\n    By Irelandus. 1839.--The theory of partial functions.

My plan requires me to bring him in: and when he comes in\r\nat the door, pity and sympathy fly out at the window. Let the reader\r\nremember that he was not an ignoramus in mathematics: he might have won his\r\nspurs if he could have first served as an esquire. Though so illiterate\r\nthat even in Ireland he never picked up anything more Latin than\r\n_Irelandus_, he was a very pretty mathematician spoiled in the making by\r\nintense self-opinion.\r\n\r\nThis is part of a private letter to me at the back of a page of print: I\r\nhad never addressed a word to him:\r\n\r\n{262}\r\n\r\n\"There are no limits in mathematics, and those that assert there are, are\r\ninfinite ruffians, ignorant, lying blackguards. There is no differential\r\ncalculus, no Taylor's theorem, no calculus of variations, &c. in\r\nmathematics. There is no quackery whatever in mathematics; no % equal to\r\nanything. What sheer ignorant blackguardism that!\r\n\r\n\"In mechanics the parallelogram of forces is quackery, and is dangerous;\r\nfor nothing is at rest, or in uniform, or in rectilinear motion, in the\r\nuniverse. Variable motion is an essential property of matter. Laplace's\r\ndemonstration of the parallelogram of forces is a begging of the question;\r\nand the attempts of them all to show that the difference of twenty minutes\r\nbetween the sidereal and actual revolution of the earth round the sun\r\narises from the tugging of the Sun and Moon at the pot-belly of the earth,\r\nwithout being sure even that the earth has a pot-belly at all, is perfect\r\nquackery. The said difference arising from and demonstrating the revolution\r\nof the Sun itself round some distant center.\"\r\n\r\nIn the letter to Lord Brougham we read as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I ask the Royal Society of London, I ask the Saxon crew of that crazy\r\nhulk, where is the dogma of their philosophic god now?... When the Royal\r\nSociety of London, and the Academy of Sciences of Paris, shall have read\r\nthis memorandum, how will they appear? Like two cur dogs in the paws of the\r\nnoblest beast of the forest.... Just as this note was going to press, a\r\nvolume lately published by you was put into my hands, wherein you attempt\r\nto defend the fluxions and _Principia_ of Newton. Man! what are you about?\r\nYou come forward now with your special pleading, and fraught with national\r\nprejudice, to defend, like the philosopher Grassi,[593] the persecutor of\r\nGalileo, principles {263} and reasoning which, unless you are actually\r\ninsane, or an ignorant quack in mathematics, you know are mathematically\r\nfalse. What a moral lesson this for the students of the University of\r\nLondon from its head! Man! demonstrate corollary 3, in this note, by the\r\nlying dogma of Newton, or turn your thoughts to something you understand.\r\n\r\n\"WALSH IRELANDUS.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Walsh--honor to his memory--once had the consideration to save me\r\npostage by addressing a pamphlet under cover to a Member of Parliament,\r\nwith an explanatory letter. In that letter he gives a candid opinion of\r\nhimself:\r\n\r\n(1838.) \"Mr. Walsh takes leave to send the enclosed corrected copy to Mr.\r\nHutton as one of the Council of the University of London, and to save\r\npostage for the Professor of Mathematics there. He will find in it geometry\r\nmore deep and subtle, and at the same time more simple and elegant, than it\r\nwas ever contemplated human genius could invent.\"\r\n\r\nHe then proceeds to set forth that a certain \"tomfoolery lemma,\" with its\r\n\"tomfoolery\" superstructure, \"never had existence outside the shallow\r\nbrains of its inventor,\" Euclid. He then proceeds thus:\r\n\r\n\"The same spirit that animated those philosophers who sent Galileo to the\r\nInquisition animates all the philosophers of the present day without\r\nexception. If anything can free them from the yoke of error, it is the\r\n[Walsh] problem of double tangence. But free them it will, how deeply\r\nsoever they may be sunk into mental slavery--and God knows that is deeply\r\nenough; and they bear it with an admirable grace; for none bear slavery\r\nwith a better grace than tyrants. The lads must adopt my theory.... It will\r\nbe a sad reverse for all our great professors to be compelled to become\r\nschoolboys in their gray years. But the sore scratch is to be compelled, as\r\nthey had before been compelled one thousand years ago, to have recourse to\r\nIreland for instruction.\" {264}\r\n\r\nThe following \"Impromptu\" is no doubt by Walsh himself: he was more of a\r\npoet than of an astronomer:\r\n\r\n   \"Through ages unfriended,\r\n    With sophistry blended,\r\n  Deep science in Chaos had slept;\r\n    Its limits were fettered,\r\n    Its voters unlettered,\r\n  Its students in movements but crept.\r\n    Till, despite of great foes,\r\n    Great WALSH first arose,\r\n  And with logical might did unravel\r\n    Those mazes of knowledge,\r\n    Ne'er known in a college,\r\n  Though sought for with unceasing travail.\r\n    With cheers we now hail him,\r\n    May success never fail him,\r\n  In Polar Geometrical mining;\r\n    Till his foes be as tamed\r\n    As his works are far-famed\r\n  For true philosophic refining.\"\r\n\r\nWalsh's system is, that all mathematics and physics are wrong: there is\r\nhardly one proposition in Euclid which is demonstrated. His example ought\r\nto warn all who rely on their own evidence to their own success. He was\r\nnot, properly speaking, insane; he only spoke his mind more freely than\r\nmany others of his class. The poor fellow died in the Cork union, during\r\nthe famine. He had lived a happy life, contemplating his own perfections,\r\nlike Brahma on the lotus-leaf.[594]\r\n\r\n{265}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROWTH OF FREEDOM OF OPINION.\r\n\r\nThe year 1825 brings me to about the middle of my _Athenaeum_ list: that is,\r\nso far as mere number of names mentioned is concerned. Freedom of opinion,\r\nbeyond a doubt, is gaining ground, for good or for evil, according to what\r\nthe speaker happens to think: admission of authority is no longer made in\r\nthe old way. If we take soul-cure and body-cure, divinity and medicine, it\r\nis manifest that a change has come over us. Time was when it was enough\r\nthat dose or dogma should be certified by \"Il a ete ordonne, Monsieur, il a\r\nete ordonne,\"[595] as the apothecary said when he wanted to operate upon\r\npoor de Porceaugnac. Very much changed: but whether for good or for evil\r\ndoes not now matter; the question is, whether contempt of _demonstration_\r\nsuch as our paradoxers show has augmented with the rejection of _dogmatic\r\nauthority_. It ought to be just the other way: for the worship of reason is\r\nthe system on which, if we trust them, the deniers of guidance ground their\r\nplan of life. The following attempt at an experiment on this point is the\r\nbest which I can make; and, so far as I know, the first that ever was made.\r\n\r\nSay that my list of paradoxers divides in 1825: this of itself proves\r\nnothing, because so many of the earlier books are lost, or not likely to be\r\ncome at. It would be a fearful rate of increase which would make the number\r\nof paradoxes since 1825 equal to the whole number before that date. Let us\r\nturn now to another collection of mine, arithmetical books, of which I have\r\npublished a list. The two collections are similarly circumstanced as to new\r\nand old books; the paradoxes had no care given to the collection of either;\r\nthe arithmetical books equal care to both. The list of arithmetical books,\r\npublished in 1847, divides at 1735; the paradoxes, up to 1863, divide at\r\n1825. If we take the process which is most against the distinction, and\r\nallow every year {266} from 1847 to 1863 to add a year to 1735, we should\r\nsay that the arithmetical writers divide at 1751. This rough process may\r\nserve, with sufficient certainty, to show that the proportion of paradoxes\r\nto books of sober demonstration is on the increase; and probably, quite as\r\nmuch as the proportion of heterodoxes to books of orthodox adherence. So\r\nthat divinity and medicine may say to geometry, Don't _you_ sneer: if\r\nrationalism, homoeopathy, and their congeners are on the rise among us,\r\nyour enemies are increasing quite as fast. But geometry replies--Dear\r\nfriends, content yourselves with the rational inference that the rise of\r\nheterodoxy within your pales is not conclusive against you, taken alone;\r\nfor it rises at the same time within mine. Store within your garners the\r\nprecious argument that you are not proved wrong by increase of dissent;\r\nbecause there is increase of dissent against exact science. But do not\r\ntherefore _even_ yourselves to me: remember that you, Dame Divinity, have\r\ninflicted every kind of penalty, from the stake to the stocks, in aid of\r\nyour reasoning; remember that you, Mother Medicine, have not many years ago\r\napplied to Parliament for increase of forcible hindrance of\r\nantipharmacopoeal drenches, pills, and powders. Who ever heard of my asking\r\nthe legislature to fine blundering circle-squarers? Remember that the D in\r\ndogma is the D in decay; but the D in demonstration is the D in durability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATUS OF MEDICINE.\r\n\r\nI have known a medical man--a young one--who was seriously of the opinion\r\nthat the country ought to be divided into medical parishes, with a\r\npractitioner appointed to each, and a penalty for calling in any but the\r\nincumbent curer. How should people know how to choose? The hair-dressers\r\nonce petitioned Parliament for an act to compel people to wear wigs. My own\r\nopinion is of the opposite extreme, as in the following letter (_Examiner_,\r\nApril 5, 1856); which, to my surprise, I saw reprinted in a medical\r\njournal, as a {267} plan not absolutely to be rejected. I am perfectly\r\nsatisfied that it would greatly promote true medical orthodoxy, the\r\npredominance of well educated thinkers, and the development of their\r\ndesirable differences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"SIR. The Medical Bill and the medical question generally is one on which\r\nexperience would teach, if people would be taught.\r\n\r\n\"The great soul question took three hundred years to settle: the little\r\nbody question might be settled in thirty years, if the decisions in the\r\nformer question were studied.\r\n\r\n\"Time was when the State believed, as honestly as ever it believed\r\nanything, that it _might_, _could_, and _should_ find out the true doctrine\r\nfor the poor ignorant community; to which, like a worthy honest state, it\r\nadded _would_. Accordingly, by the assistance of the Church, which\r\nundertook the physic, the surgery, and the pharmacy of sound doctrine all\r\nby itself, it sent forth its legally qualified teachers into every parish,\r\nand woe to the man who called in any other. They burnt that man, they\r\nwhipped him, they imprisoned him, they did everything but what was\r\nChristian to him, all for his soul's health and the amendment of his\r\nexcesses.\r\n\r\n\"But men would not submit. To the argument that the State was a father to\r\nthe ignorant, they replied that it was at best the ignorant father of an\r\nignorant son, and that a blind man could find his way into a ditch without\r\nanother blind man to help him. And when the State said--But here we have\r\nthe Church, which knows all about it, the ignorant community declared that\r\nit had a right to judge that question, and that it would judge it. It also\r\nsaid that the Church was never one thing long, and that it progressed, on\r\nthe whole, rather more slowly than the ignorant community.\r\n\r\n\"The end of it was, in this country, that every one who chose taught all\r\nwho chose to let him teach, on condition only of an open and true\r\nregistration. The State was {268} allowed to patronize one particular\r\nChurch, so that no one need trouble himself to choose a pastor from the\r\nmere necessity of choosing. But every church is allowed its colleges, its\r\nstudies, its diplomas; and every man is allowed his choice. There is no\r\nproof that our souls are worse off than in the sixteenth century; and,\r\njudging by fruits, there is much reason to hope they are better off.\r\n\r\n\"Now the little body question is a perfect parallel to the great soul\r\nquestion in all its circumstances. The only things in which the parallel\r\nfails are the following: Every one who believes in a future state sees that\r\nthe soul question is incomparably more important than the body question,\r\nand every one can try the body question by experiment to a larger extent\r\nthan the soul question. The proverb, which always has a spark of truth at\r\nthe bottom, says that every man of forty is either a fool or a physician;\r\nbut did even the proverb maker ever dare to say that every man is at any\r\nage either a fool or a fit teacher of religion?\r\n\r\n\"Common sense points out the following settlement of the medical question:\r\nand to this it will come sooner or later.\r\n\r\n\"Let every man who chooses--subject to one common law of manslaughter for\r\nall the _crass_ cases--doctor the bodies of all who choose to trust him,\r\nand recover payment according to agreement in the courts of law. Provided\r\nalways that every person practising should be registered at a moderate fee\r\nin a register to be republished every six months.\r\n\r\n\"Let the register give the name, address, and asserted qualification of\r\neach candidate--as licentiate, or doctor, or what not, of this or that\r\ncollege, hall, university, &c., home or foreign. Let it be competent to any\r\nman to describe himself as qualified by study in public schools without a\r\ndiploma, or by private study, or even by intuition or divine inspiration,\r\nif he please. But whatever he holds his qualification to be, that let him\r\ndeclare. Let all qualification {269} which of its own nature admits of\r\nproof be proved, as by the diploma or certificate, &c., leaving things\r\nwhich cannot be proved, as asserted private study, intuition, inspiration,\r\n&c., to work their own way.\r\n\r\n\"Let it be highly penal to assert to the patient any qualification which is\r\nnot in the register, and let the register be sold very cheap. Let the\r\nregistrar give each registered practitioner a copy of the register in his\r\nown case; let any patient have the power to demand a sight of this copy;\r\nand let no money for attendance be recoverable in any case in which there\r\nhas been false representation.\r\n\r\n\"Let any party in any suit have a right to produce what medical testimony\r\nhe pleases. Let the medical witness produce his register, and let his\r\nevidence be for the jury, as is that of an engineer or a practitioner of\r\nany art which is not attested by diplomas.\r\n\r\n\"Let any man who practises without venturing to put his name on the\r\nregister be liable to fine and imprisonment.\r\n\r\n\"The consequence would be that, as now, anybody who pleases might practise;\r\nfor the medical world is well aware that there is no power of preventing\r\nwhat they call quacks from practising. But very different from what is now,\r\nevery man who practises would be obliged to tell the whole world what his\r\nclaim is, and would run a great risk if he dared to tell his patient in\r\nprivate anything different from what he had told the whole world.\r\n\r\n\"The consequence would be that a real education in anatomy, physiology,\r\nchemistry, surgery, and what is known of the thing called medicine, would\r\nacquire more importance than it now has.\r\n\r\n\"It is curious to see how completely the medical man of the nineteenth\r\ncentury squares with the priest of the sixteenth century. The clergy of all\r\nsects are now better divines and better men than they ever were. They have\r\nlost Bacon's reproach that they took a smaller measure of things than any\r\nother educated men; and the physicians are now {270} in this particular the\r\nrearguard of the learned world; though it may be true that the rear in our\r\nday is further on in the march than the van of Bacon's day. Nor will they\r\never recover the lost position until medicine is as free as religion.\r\n\r\n\"To this it must come. To this the public, which will decide for itself,\r\nhas determined it shall come. To this the public has, in fact, brought it,\r\nbut on a plan which it is not desirable to make permanent. We will be as\r\nfree to take care of our bodies as of our souls and of our goods. This is\r\nthe profession of all who sign as I do, and the practice of most of those\r\nwho would not like the name\r\n\r\n\"HETEROPATH.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    The motion of the Sun in the Ecliptic, proved to be uniform in a\r\n    circular orbit ... with preliminary observations on the fallacy of the\r\n    Solar System. By Bartholomew Prescott,[596] 1825, 8vo.\r\n\r\nThe author had published, in 1803, a _Defence of the Divine System_, which\r\nI never saw; also, _On the inverted scheme of Copernicus_. The above work\r\nis clever in its satire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHRISTIAN EVIDENCE SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n    Manifesto of the Christian Evidence Society, established Nov. 12, 1824.\r\n    Twenty-four plain questions to honest men.\r\n\r\nThese are two broadsides of August and November, 1826, signed by Robert\r\nTaylor,[597] A.B., Orator of the Christian Evidence Society. This gentleman\r\nwas a clergyman, {271} and was convicted of blasphemy in 1827, for which he\r\nsuffered imprisonment, and got the name of the _Devil's Chaplain_. The\r\nfollowing are quotations:\r\n\r\n\"For the book of Revelation, there was no original Greek at all, but\r\n_Erasmus_ wrote it himself in Switzerland, in the year 1516. Bishop\r\nMarsh,[598] vol. i. p. 320.\"--\"Is not God the author of your reason? Can he\r\nthen be the author of anything which is contrary to your reason? If reason\r\nbe a sufficient guide, why should God give you any other? if it be not a\r\nsufficient guide, why has he given you _that_?\"\r\n\r\nI remember a votary of the Society being asked to substitute for _reason_\r\n\"the right leg,\" and for _guide_ \"support,\" and to answer the two last\r\nquestions: he said there must be a quibble, but he did not see what. It is\r\npleasant to reflect that the _argumentum a carcere_[599] is obsolete. One\r\ngreat defect of it was that it did not go far enough: there should have\r\nbeen laws against subscriptions for blasphemers, against dealing at their\r\nshops, and against rich widows marrying them.\r\n\r\nHad I taken in theology, I must have entered books against Christianity. I\r\nmention the above, and Paine's _Age of Reason_, simply because they are the\r\nonly English modern works that ever came in my way without my asking for\r\nthem. The three parts of the _Age of Reason_ were published in Paris 1793,\r\nParis 1795, and New York 1807. Carlile's[600] edition is of London, 1818,\r\n8vo. It must be republished when the time comes, to show what stuff\r\ngovernments and clergy were afraid of at the beginning of this century. I\r\nshould never have seen the book, if it {272} had not been prohibited: a\r\nbookseller put it under my nose with a fearful look round him; and I could\r\ndo no less, in common curiosity, than buy a work which had been so\r\ncomplimented by church and state. And when I had read it, I said in my mind\r\nto church and state,--Confound you! you have taken me in worse than any\r\nreviewer I ever met with. I forget what I gave for the book, but I ought to\r\nhave been able to claim compensation somewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CABBALA.\r\n\r\n    Cabbala Algebraica. Auctore Gul. Lud. Christmann.[601] Stuttgard, 1827,\r\n    4to.\r\n\r\nEighty closely printed pages of an attempt to solve equations of every\r\ndegree, which has a process called by the author _cabbala_. An anonymous\r\ncorrespondent spells _cabbala_ as follows, [Greek: chabball], and makes 666\r\nout of its letters. This gentleman has sent me since my Budget commenced, a\r\nlittle heap of satirical communications, each having a 666 or two; for\r\ninstance, alluding to my remarks on the spelling of _chemistry_, he finds\r\nthe fated number in [Greek: chimeia]. With these are challenges to explain\r\nthem, and hints about the end of the world. All these letters have\r\ndifferent fantastic seals; one of them with the legend \"keep your\r\ntemper,\"--another bearing \"bank token five pence.\" The only signature is a\r\ntriangle with a little circle in it, which I interpret to mean that the\r\nwriter confesses himself to be the round man stuck in the three-cornered\r\nhole, to be explained as in Sydney Smith's joke.\r\n\r\n{273}\r\n\r\nThere is a kind of Cabbala Alphabetica which the investigators of the\r\nnumerals in words would do well to take up: it is the formation of\r\nsentences which contain all the letters of the alphabet, and each only\r\nonce. No one has done it with _v_ and _j_ treated as consonants; but you\r\nand I can do it. Dr. Whewell[602] and I amused ourselves, some years ago,\r\nwith attempts. He could not make sense, though he joined words: he gave me\r\n\r\n  Phiz, styx, wrong, buck, flame, quid.\r\n\r\nI gave him the following, which he agreed was \"admirable sense\": I\r\ncertainly think the words would never have come together except in this\r\nway:\r\n\r\n  I, quartz pyx, who fling muck beds.\r\n\r\nI long thought that no human being could say this under any circumstances.\r\nAt last I happened to be reading a religious writer--as he thought\r\nhimself--who threw aspersions on his opponents thick and threefold. Heyday!\r\ncame into my head, this fellow flings muck beds; he must be a quartz pyx.\r\nAnd then I remembered that a pyx is a sacred vessel, and quartz is a hard\r\nstone, as hard as the heart of a religious foe-curser. So that the line is\r\nthe motto of the ferocious sectarian, who turns his religious vessels into\r\nmudholders, for the benefit of those who will not see what he sees.\r\n\r\nI can find no circumstances for the following, which I received from\r\nanother:\r\n\r\n  Fritz! quick! land! hew gypsum box.\r\n\r\nFrom other quarters I have the following:\r\n\r\n  Dumpy quiz! whirl back fogs next.\r\n\r\nThis might be said in time of haze to the queer little figure in the Dutch\r\nweather-toy, which comes out or goes in with the change in the atmosphere.\r\nAgain,\r\n\r\n{274}\r\n\r\n  Export my fund!  Quiz black whigs.\r\n\r\nThis Squire Western might have said, who was always afraid of the whigs\r\nsending the sinking-fund over to Hanover. But the following is the best: it\r\nis good advice to a young man, very well expressed under the circumstances:\r\n\r\n  Get nymph; quiz sad brow; fix luck.\r\n\r\nWhich in more sober English would be, Marry; be cheerful; watch your\r\nbusiness. There is more edification, more religion in this than in all the\r\n666-interpretations put together.\r\n\r\nSuch things would make excellent writing copies, for they secure attention\r\nto every letter; _v_ and _j_ might be placed at the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON GODFREY HIGGINS.\r\n\r\n    The Celtic Druids. By Godfrey Higgins,[603] Esq. of Skellow Grange,\r\n    near Doncaster. London, 1827, 4to.\r\n\r\n    Anacalypsis, or an attempt to draw aside the veil of the Saitic Isis:\r\n    or an inquiry into the origin of languages, nations, and religions. By\r\n    Godfrey Higgins, &c..., London, 1836, 2 vols. 4to.\r\n\r\nThe first work had an additional preface and a new index in 1829. Possibly,\r\nin future time, will be found bound up with copies of the second work two\r\nsheets which Mr. Higgins circulated among his friends in 1831: the first a\r\n\"Recapitulation,\" the second \"Book vi. ch. 1.\"\r\n\r\nThe system of these works is that--\r\n\r\n\"The Buddhists of Upper India (of whom the Phenician Canaanite,\r\nMelchizedek, was a priest), who built the Pyramids, Stonehenge, Carnac, &c.\r\nwill be shown to have founded all the ancient mythologies of the world,\r\nwhich, however varied and corrupted in recent times, were originally one,\r\nand that one founded on principles sublime, beautiful, and true.\"\r\n\r\n{275}\r\n\r\nThese works contain an immense quantity of learning, very honestly put\r\ntogether. I presume the enormous number of facts, and the goodness of the\r\nindex, to be the reasons why the _Anacalypsis_ found a permanent place in\r\nthe _old_ reading-room of the British Museum, even before the change which\r\ngreatly increased the number of books left free to the reader in that room.\r\n\r\nMr. Higgins, whom I knew well in the last six years of his life, and\r\nrespected as a good, learned, and (in his own way) _pious_ man, was\r\nthoroughly and completely the man of a system. He had that sort of mental\r\nconnection with his theory that made his statements of his authorities\r\ntrustworthy: for, besides perfect integrity, he had no bias towards\r\nalteration of facts: he saw his system in the way the fact was presented to\r\nhim by his authority, be that what it might.\r\n\r\nHe was very sure of a fact which he got from any of his authorities:\r\nnothing could shake him. Imagine a conversation between him and an Indian\r\nofficer who had paid long attention to Hindoo antiquities and their\r\nremains: a third person was present, _ego qui scribo_. _G. H._ \"You know\r\nthat in the temples of I-forget-who the Ceres is always sculptured\r\nprecisely as in Greece.\" _Col._ ----, \"I really do not remember it, and I\r\nhave seen most of these temples.\" _G. H._ \"It is so, I assure you,\r\nespecially at I-forget-where.\" _Col._ ----, \"Well, I am sure! I was\r\nencamped for six weeks at the gate of that very temple, and, except a\r\nlittle shooting, had nothing to do but to examine its details, which I did,\r\nday after day, and I found nothing of the kind.\" It was of no use at all.\r\n\r\nGodfrey Higgins began life by exposing and conquering, at the expense of\r\ntwo years of his studies, some shocking abuses which existed in the York\r\nLunatic Asylum. This was a proceeding which called much attention to the\r\ntreatment of the insane, and produced much good effect. He was very\r\nresolute and energetic. The magistracy of his {276} time had such scruples\r\nabout using the severity of law to people of such station as well-to-do\r\nfarmers, &c.: they would allow a great deal of resistance, and endeavor to\r\nmollify the rebels into obedience. A young farmer flatly refused to pay\r\nunder an order of affiliation made upon him by Godfrey Higgins. He was duly\r\nwarned; and persisted: he shortly found himself in gaol. He went there sure\r\nto conquer the Justice, and the first thing he did was to demand to see his\r\nlawyer. He was told, to his horror, that as soon as he had been cropped and\r\nprison-dressed, he might see as many lawyers as he pleased, to be looked\r\nat, laughed at, and advised that there was but one way out of the scrape.\r\nHiggins was, in his speculations, a regular counterpart of Bailly; but the\r\ncelebrated Mayor of Paris had not his nerve. It was impossible to say, if\r\ntheir characters had been changed, whether the unfortunate crisis in which\r\nBailly was not equal to the occasion would have led to very different\r\nresults if Higgins had been in his place: but assuredly constitutional\r\nliberty would have had one chance more. There are two works of his by which\r\nhe was known, apart from his paradoxes. First, _An apology for the life and\r\ncharacter of the celebrated prophet of Arabia, called Mohamed, or the\r\nIllustrious_. London, 8vo. 1829. The reader will look at this writing of\r\nour English Buddhist with suspicious eye, but he will not be able to avoid\r\nconfessing that the Arabian prophet has some reparation to demand at the\r\nhands of Christians. Next, _Horae Sabaticae; or an attempt to correct certain\r\nsuperstitions and vulgar errors respecting the Sabbath_. Second edition,\r\nwith a large appendix. London, 12mo. 1833. This book was very heterodox at\r\nthe time, but it has furnished material for some of the clergy of our day.\r\n\r\nI never could quite make out whether Godfrey Higgins took that system which\r\nhe traced to the Buddhists to have a Divine origin, or to be the result of\r\ngood men's meditations. Himself a strong theist, and believer in a future\r\n{277} state, one would suppose that he would refer a _universal_ religion,\r\nspread in different forms over the whole earth from one source, directly to\r\nthe universal Parent. And this I suspect he did, whether he knew it or not.\r\nThe external evidence is balanced. In his preface he says:\r\n\r\n\"I cannot help smiling when I consider that the priests have objected to\r\nadmit my former book, _The Celtic Druids_, into libraries, because it was\r\nantichristian; and it has been attacked by Deists, because it was\r\nsuperfluously religious. The learned Deist, the Rev. R. Taylor [already\r\nmentioned], has designated me as the _religious_ Mr. Higgins.\"\r\n\r\nThe time will come when some profound historian of literature will make\r\nhimself much clearer on the point than I am.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON POPE'S DIPPING NEEDLE.\r\n\r\n    The triumphal Chariot of Friction: or a familiar elucidation of the\r\n    origin of magnetic attraction, &c. &c. By William Pope.[604] London,\r\n    1829, 4to.\r\n\r\nPart of this work is on a dipping-needle of the author's construction. It\r\nmust have been under the impression that a book of naval magnetism was\r\nproposed, that a great many officers, the Royal Naval Club, etc. lent their\r\nnames to the subscription list. How must they have been surprised to find,\r\nright opposite to the list of subscribers, the plate presenting \"the three\r\nemphatic letters, J. A. O.\" And how much more when they saw it set forth\r\nthat if a square be inscribed in a circle, a circle within that, then a\r\nsquare again, &c., it is impossible to have more than fourteen circles, let\r\nthe first circle be as large as you please. From this the seven attributes\r\nof God are unfolded; and further, that all matter was _moral_, until\r\nLucifer _churned_ it into _physical_ \"as far as the third circle in Deity\":\r\nthis Lucifer, called Leviathan in Job, being thus the moving cause of {278}\r\nchaos. I shall say no more, except that the friction of the air is the\r\ncause of magnetism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Remarks on the Architecture, Sculpture, and Zodiac of Palmyra; with a\r\n    Key to the Inscriptions.

This\r\nis topped up with the problem of sound in a tube, and a slice of Laplace's\r\ntheory of the tides. All to be studied until known by heart, and all the\r\nrest will come, or at least join on easily when it comes. There is much\r\ntruth in the assertion that new knowledge {279} hooks on easily to a little\r\nof the old, thoroughly mastered. The day is coming when it will be found\r\nout that crammed erudition, got up for examinations, does not cast out any\r\nhooks for more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Lettre a MM. les Membres de l'Academie Royale des Sciences, contenant\r\n    un developpement de la refutation du systeme de la gravitation\r\n    universelle, qui leur a ete presentee le 30 aout, 1830.

In France\r\nthere is only the Academy of Sciences to go to: in England there is a\r\nreading public out of the Royal Society, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA DISCOURSE ON PROBABILITY.\r\n\r\nAbout 1830 was published, in the _Library of Useful Knowledge_, the tract\r\non _Probability_, the joint work of the late Sir John Lubbock[611] and Mr.\r\nDrinkwater (Bethune).[612] It is one of the best elementary openings of the\r\nsubject. A binder put my name on the outside (the work was anonymous) and\r\nthe consequence was that nothing could drive out of people's heads that it\r\nwas written by me. I do not know how many denials I have made, from a\r\npassage in one of my own works to a letter in the _Times_: and I am not\r\nsure that I have succeeded in establishing the truth, even now. I\r\naccordingly note the fact once more. But as a book has no right here unless\r\nit contain a paradox--or thing counter to general opinion or practice--I\r\nwill produce two small ones. Sir John Lubbock, with whom lay the executive\r\narrangement, had a strong objection to the last word in \"Theory of\r\nProbabilities,\" he maintained that the singular _probability_, should be\r\nused; and I hold him quite right.\r\n\r\n{280}\r\n\r\nThe second case was this: My friend Sir J. L., with a large cluster of\r\nintellectual qualities, and another of social qualities, had one point of\r\ncharacter which I will not call bad and cannot call good; he never used a\r\nslang expression. To such a length did he carry his dislike, that he could\r\nnot bear _head_ and _tail_, even in a work on games of chance: so he used\r\n_obverse_ and _reverse_. I stared when I first saw this: but, to my\r\ndelight, I found that the force of circumstances beat him at last. He was\r\nobliged to take an example from the race-course, and the name of one of the\r\nhorses was _Bessy Bedlam_! And he did not put her down as _Elizabeth\r\nBethlehem_, but forced himself to follow the jockeys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Almanach Romain sur la Loterie Royale de France, ou les Etrennes\r\n    necessaires aux Actionnaires et Receveurs de la dite Loterie. Par M.\r\n    Menut de St.-Mesmin. Paris, 1830. 12mo.\r\n\r\nThis book contains all the drawings of the French lottery (two or three,\r\neach month) from 1758 to 1830. It is intended for those who thought they\r\ncould predict the future drawings from the past: and various sets of\r\n_sympathetic_ numbers are given to help them. The principle is, that\r\nanything which has not happened for a long time must be soon to come. At\r\n_rouge et noir_, for example, when the red has won five times running,\r\nsagacious gamblers stake on the black, for they think the turn which must\r\ncome at last is nearer than it was. So it is: but observation would have\r\nshown that if a large number of those cases had been registered which show\r\na run of five for the red, the next game would just as often have made the\r\nrun into six as have turned in favor of the black. But the gambling\r\nreasoner is incorrigible: if he would but take to squaring the circle, what\r\na load of misery would be saved. A writer of 1823, who appeared to be\r\nthoroughly acquainted with the gambling of Paris and London, says that the\r\ngamesters by {281} profession are haunted by a secret foreboding of their\r\nfuture destruction, and seem as if they said to the banker at the table, as\r\nthe gladiators said to the emperor, _Morituri te salutant_.[613]\r\n\r\nIn the French lottery, five numbers out of ninety were drawn at a time. Any\r\nperson, in any part of the country, might stake any sum upon any event he\r\npleased, as that 27 should be drawn; that 42 and 81 should be drawn; that\r\n42 and 81 should be drawn, and 42 first; and so on up to a _quine\r\ndetermine_, if he chose, which is betting on five given numbers in a given\r\norder. Thus, in July, 1821, one of the drawings was\r\n\r\n  8   46   16   64   13.\r\n\r\nA gambler had actually predicted the five numbers (but not their order),\r\nand won 131,350 francs on a trifling stake. M. Menut seems to insinuate\r\nthat the hint what numbers to choose was given at his own office. Another\r\nwon 20,852 francs on the quaterne, 8, 16, 46, 64, in this very drawing.\r\nThese gains, of course, were widely advertised: of the multitudes who lost\r\nnothing was said. The enormous number of those who played is proved to all\r\nwho have studied chances arithmetically by the numbers of simple quaternes\r\nwhich were gained: in 1822, fourteen; in 1823, six; in 1824, sixteen; in\r\n1825, nine, &c.\r\n\r\nThe paradoxes of what is called chance, or hazard, might themselves make a\r\nsmall volume. All the world understands that there is a long run, a general\r\naverage; but great part of the world is surprised that this general average\r\nshould be computed and predicted. There are many remarkable cases of\r\nverification; and one of them relates to the quadrature of the circle. I\r\ngive some account of this and another. Throw a penny time after time until\r\n_head_ arrives, which it will do before long: let this be called a _set_.\r\nAccordingly, H is the smallest set, TH the next smallest, then TTH, &c. For\r\nabbreviation, let a set in which seven _tails_ {282} occur before _head_\r\nturns up be T^{7}H. In an immense number of trials of sets, about half will\r\nbe H; about a quarter TH; about an eighth, T^{2}H. Buffon[614] tried 2,048\r\nsets; and several have followed him. It will tend to illustrate the\r\nprinciple if I give all the results; namely, that many trials will with\r\nmoral certainty show an approach--and the greater the greater the number of\r\ntrials--to that average which sober reasoning predicts. In the first column\r\nis the most likely number of the theory: the next column gives Buffon's\r\nresult; the three next are results obtained from trial by correspondents of\r\nmine. In each case the number of trials is 2,048.\r\n\r\n  H         1,024    1,061    1,048    1,017    1,039\r\n  TH          512      494      507      547      480\r\n  T^{2}H      256      232      248      235      267\r\n  T^{3}H      128      137       99      118      126\r\n  T^{4}H       64       56       71       72       67\r\n  T^{5}H       32       29       38       32       33\r\n  T^{6}H       16       25       17       10       19\r\n  T^{7}H        8        8        9        9       10\r\n  T^{8}H        4        6        5        3        3\r\n  T^{9}H        2                 3        2        4\r\n  T^{10}H       1                 1        1\r\n  T^{11}H                         0        1\r\n  T^{12}H                         0        0\r\n  T^{13}H       1                 1        0\r\n  T^{14}H                         0        0\r\n  T^{15}H                         1        1\r\n  &c.                             0        0\r\n            -----    -----    -----    -----    -----\r\n            2,048    2,048    2,048    2,048    2,048\r\n\r\n{283}\r\n\r\nIn very many trials, then, we may depend upon something like the predicted\r\naverage. Conversely, from many trials we may form a guess at what the\r\naverage will be. Thus, in Buffon's experiment the 2,048 first throws of the\r\nsets gave _head_ in 1,061 cases: we have a right to infer that in the long\r\nrun something like 1,061 out of 2,048 is the proportion of heads, even\r\nbefore we know the reasons for the equality of chance, which tell us that\r\n1,024 out of 2,048 is the real truth. I now come to the way in which such\r\nconsiderations have led to a mode in which mere pitch-and-toss has given a\r\nmore accurate approach to the quadrature of the circle than has been\r\nreached by some of my paradoxers. What would my friend[615] in No. 14 have\r\nsaid to this? The method is as follows: Suppose a planked floor of the\r\nusual kind, with thin visible seams between the planks. Let there be a thin\r\nstraight rod, or wire, not so long as the breadth of the plank. This rod,\r\nbeing tossed up at hazard, will either fall quite clear of the seams, or\r\nwill lay across one seam. Now Buffon, and after him Laplace, proved the\r\nfollowing: That in the long run the fraction of the whole number of trials\r\nin which a seam is intersected will be the fraction which twice the length\r\nof the rod is of the circumference of the circle having the breadth of a\r\nplank for its diameter. In 1855 Mr. _Ambrose_ Smith, of Aberdeen, made\r\n3,204 trials with a rod three-fifths of the distance between the planks:\r\nthere were 1,213 clear intersections, and 11 contacts on which it was\r\ndifficult to decide. Divide these contacts equally, and we have 1,2181/2 to\r\n3,204 for the ratio of 6 to 5[pi], presuming that the greatness of the\r\nnumber of trials gives something near to the final average, or result in\r\nthe long run: this gives [pi] = 3.1553. If all the 11 contacts had been\r\ntreated as intersections, the result would have been {284} [pi] = 3.1412,\r\nexceedingly near. A pupil of mine made 600 trials with a rod of the length\r\nbetween the seams, and got [pi] = 3.137.\r\n\r\nThis method will hardly be believed until it has been repeated so often\r\nthat \"there never could have been any doubt about it.\"\r\n\r\nThe first experiment strongly illustrates a truth of the theory, well\r\nconfirmed by practice: whatever can happen will happen if we make trials\r\nenough. Who would undertake to throw tail eight times running?\r\nNevertheless, in the 8,192 sets tail 8 times running occurred 17 times; 9\r\ntimes running, 9 times; 10 times running, twice; 11 times and 13 times,\r\neach once; and 15 times twice.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON CURIOSITIES OF [pi].\r\n\r\n1830. The celebrated interminable fraction 3.14159..., which the\r\nmathematician calls [pi], is the ratio of the circumference to the\r\ndiameter. But it is thousands of things besides. It is constantly turning\r\nup in mathematics: and if arithmetic and algebra had been studied without\r\ngeometry, [pi] must have come in somehow, though at what stage or under\r\nwhat name must have depended upon the casualties of algebraical invention.\r\nThis will readily be seen when it is stated that [pi] is nothing but four\r\ntimes the series\r\n\r\n  1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - 1/11 + ...\r\n\r\n_ad infinitum_.[616] It would be wonderful if so simple a series {285} had\r\nbut one kind of occurrence. As it is, our trigonometry being founded on the\r\ncircle, [pi] first appears as the ratio stated. If, for instance, a deep\r\nstudy of probable fluctuation from average had preceded, [pi] might have\r\nemerged as a number perfectly indispensable in such problems as: What is\r\nthe chance of the number of aces lying between a million + x and a million\r\n- x, when six million of throws are made with a die? I have not gone into\r\nany detail of all those cases in which the paradoxer finds out, by his\r\nunassisted acumen, that results of mathematical investigation _cannot be_:\r\nin fact, this discovery is only an accompaniment, though a necessary one,\r\nof his paradoxical statement of that which _must be_. Logicians are\r\nbeginning to see that the notion of _horse_ is inseparably connected with\r\nthat of _non-horse_: that the first without the second would be no notion\r\nat all. And it is clear that the positive affirmation of that which\r\ncontradicts mathematical demonstration cannot but be accompanied by a\r\ndeclaration, mostly overtly made, that demonstration is false. If the\r\nmathematician were interested in punishing this indiscretion, he could make\r\nhis denier ridiculous by inventing asserted results which would completely\r\ntake him in.\r\n\r\nMore than thirty years ago I had a friend, now long gone, who was a\r\nmathematician, but not of the higher branches: he was, _inter alia_,\r\nthoroughly up in all that relates to mortality, life assurance, &c. One\r\nday, explaining to him how it should be ascertained what the chance is of\r\nthe survivors of a large number of persons now alive lying between given\r\nlimits of number at the end of a certain time, I came, of course upon the\r\nintroduction of [pi], which I could only describe as the ratio of the\r\ncircumference of a circle to its diameter. \"Oh, my dear friend! that must\r\nbe a delusion; what can the circle have to do with the numbers alive at the\r\nend of a given time?\"--\"I cannot demonstrate it to you; but it is\r\ndemonstrated.\"--\"Oh! stuff! I think you can prove anything with your\r\ndifferential calculus: figment, {286} depend upon it.\" I said no more; but,\r\na few days afterwards, I went to him and very gravely told him that I had\r\ndiscovered the law of human mortality in the Carlisle Table, of which he\r\nthought very highly. I told him that the law was involved in this\r\ncircumstance. Take the table of expectation of life, choose any age, take\r\nits expectation and make the nearest integer a new age, do the same with\r\nthat, and so on; begin at what age you like, you are sure to end at the\r\nplace where the age past is equal, or most nearly equal, to the expectation\r\nto come. \"You don't mean that this always happens?\"--\"Try it.\" He did try,\r\nagain and again; and found it as I said. \"This is, indeed, a curious thing;\r\nthis _is_ a discovery.\" I might have sent him about trumpeting the law of\r\nlife: but I contented myself with informing him that the same thing would\r\nhappen with any table whatsoever in which the first column goes up and the\r\nsecond goes down; and that if a proficient in the higher mathematics chose\r\nto palm a figment upon him, he could do without the circle: _a corsaire,\r\ncorsaire et demi_,[617] the French proverb says. \"Oh!\" it was remarked, \"I\r\nsee, this was Milne!\"[618] It was _not_ Milne: I remember well showing the\r\nformula to him some time afterwards. He raised no difficulty about [pi]; he\r\nknew the forms of Laplace's results, and he was much interested. Besides,\r\nMilne never said stuff! and figment! And he would not have been taken in:\r\nhe would have quietly tried it with the Northampton and all the other\r\ntables, and would have got at the truth.\r\n\r\n{287}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEUCLID WITHOUT AXIOMS.\r\n\r\n    The first book of Euclid's Elements.

By a member of the\r\n    University of Cambridge. Third edition. In usum serenissimae filiolae.\r\n    London, 1830.\r\n\r\nThe author was Lieut. Col. (now General) Perronet Thompson,[619] the author\r\nof the \"Catechism on the Corn Laws.\" I reviewed the fourth edition--which\r\nhad the name of \"Geometry without Axioms,\" 1833--in the quarterly _Journal\r\nof Education_ for January, 1834. Col. Thompson, who then was a contributor\r\nto--if not editor of--the _Westminster Review_, replied in an article the\r\nauthorship of which could not be mistaken.\r\n\r\nSome more attempts upon the problem, by the same author, will be found in\r\nthe sequel. They are all of acute and legitimate speculation; but they do\r\nnot conquer the difficulty in the manner demanded by the conditions of the\r\nproblem. The paradox of parallels does not contribute much to my pages: its\r\ncases are to be found for the most part in geometrical systems, or in notes\r\nto them. Most of them consist in the proposal of additional postulates;\r\nsome are attempts to do without any new postulate. Gen. Perronet Thompson,\r\nwhose paradoxes are always constructed on much study of previous writers,\r\nhas collected in the work above named, a budget of attempts, the heads of\r\nwhich are in the _Penny_ and _English Cyclopaedias_, at \"Parallels.\" He has\r\ngiven thirty instances, selected from what he had found.[620]\r\n\r\n{288}\r\n\r\nLagrange,[621] in one of the later years of his life, imagined that he had\r\novercome the difficulty. He went so far as to write a paper, which he took\r\nwith him to the Institute, and began to read it. But in the first paragraph\r\nsomething struck him which he had not observed: he muttered _Il faut que\r\nj'y songe encore_,[622] and put the paper in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LUNAR CAUSTIC JOKE.\r\n\r\nThe following paragraph appeared in the _Morning Post_, May 4, 1831:\r\n\r\n\"We understand that although, owing to circumstances with which the public\r\nare not concerned, Mr. Goulburn[623] declined becoming a candidate for\r\nUniversity honors, that his scientific attainments are far from\r\ninconsiderable. He is well known to be the author of an essay in the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions on the accurate rectification of a circular arc,\r\nand of an investigation of the equation of a lunar caustic--a problem\r\nlikely to become of great use in nautical astronomy.\"\r\n\r\n{289}\r\n\r\nThis hoax--which would probably have succeeded with any journal--was palmed\r\nupon the _Morning Post_, which supported Mr. Goulburn, by some Cambridge\r\nwags who supported Mr. Lubbock, the other candidate for the University of\r\nCambridge. Putting on the usual concealment, I may say that I always\r\nsuspected Dr-nkw-t-r B-th-n-[624] of having a share in the matter. The\r\nskill of the hoax lies in avoiding the words \"quadrature of the circle,\"\r\nwhich all know, and speaking of \"the accurate rectification of a circular\r\narc,\" which all do not know for its synonyme. The _Morning Post_ next day\r\ngave a reproof to hoaxers in general, without referring to any particular\r\ncase. It must be added, that although there are _caustics_ in mathematics,\r\nthere is no _lunar_ caustic.\r\n\r\nSo far as Mr. Goulburn was concerned, the above was poetic justice. He was\r\nthe minister who, in old time, told a deputation from the Astronomical\r\nSociety that the Government \"did not care twopence for all the science in\r\nthe country.\" There may be some still alive who remember this: I heard it\r\nfrom more than one of those who were present, and are now gone. Matters are\r\nmuch changed. I was thirty years in office at the Astronomical Society;\r\nand, to my certain knowledge, every Government of that period, Whig and\r\nTory, showed itself ready to help with influence when wanted, and with\r\nmoney whenever there was an answer for the House of Commons. The following\r\ncorrection subsequently appeared. Referring to the hoax about Mr. Goulburn,\r\nMessrs. C. H. and Thompson Cooper[625] have corrected an error, by stating\r\nthat the election which gave rise to the hoax was that in which Messrs.\r\nGoulburn {290} and Yates Peel[626] defeated Lord Palmerston[627] and Mr.\r\nCavendish.[628] They add that Mr. Gunning, the well-known Esquire Bedell of\r\nthe University, attributed the hoax to the late Rev. R. Sheepshanks, to\r\nwhom, they state, are also attributed certain clever fictitious\r\nbiographies--of public men, as I understand it--which were palmed upon the\r\neditor of the _Cambridge Chronicle_, who never suspected their genuineness\r\nto the day of his death. Being in most confidential intercourse with Mr.\r\nSheepshanks,[629] both at the time and all the rest of his life\r\n(twenty-five years), and never heard him allude to any such things--which\r\nwere not in his line, though he had satirical power of quite another {291}\r\nkind--I feel satisfied he had nothing to do with them. I may add that\r\nothers, his nearest friends, and also members of his family, never heard\r\nhim allude to these hoaxes as their author, and disbelieve his authorship\r\nas much as I do myself. I say this not as imputing any blame to the true\r\nauthor, such hoaxes being fair election jokes in all time, but merely to\r\nput the saddle off the wrong horse, and to give one more instance of the\r\ninsecurity of imputed authorship. Had Mr. Sheepshanks ever told me that he\r\nhad perpetrated the hoax, I should have had no hesitation in giving it to\r\nhim. I consider all clever election squibs, free from bitterness and\r\npersonal imputation, as giving the multitude good channels for the vent of\r\nfeelings which but for them would certainly find bad ones.\r\n\r\n[But I now suspect that Mr. Babbage[630] had some hand in the hoax. He\r\ngives it in his \"Passages, &c.\" and is evidently writing from memory, for\r\nhe gives the wrong year. But he has given the paragraph, though not\r\naccurately, yet with such a recollection of the points as brings suspicion\r\nof the authorship upon him, perhaps in conjunction with D. B.[631] Both\r\nwere on Cavendish's committee. Mr. Babbage adds, that \"late one evening a\r\ncab drove up in hot haste to the office of the _Morning Post_, delivered\r\nthe copy as coming from Mr. Goulburn's committee, and at the same time\r\nordered fifty extra copies of the _Post_ to be sent next morning to their\r\ncommittee-room.\" I think the man--the only one I ever heard of--who knew\r\nall about the cab and the extra copies must have known more.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON M. DEMONVILLE.\r\n\r\n_Demonville._--A Frenchman's Christian name is his own secret, unless there\r\nbe two of the surname. M. Demonville is a very good instance of the\r\ndifference between a {292} French and English discoverer. In England there\r\nis a public to listen to discoveries in mathematical subjects made without\r\nmathematics: a public which will hear, and wonder, and think it possible\r\nthat the pretensions of the discoverer have some foundation. The unnoticed\r\nman may possibly be right: and the old country-town reputation which I once\r\nheard of, attaching to a man who \"had written a book about the signs of the\r\nzodiac which all the philosophers in London could not answer,\" is fame as\r\nfar as it goes. Accordingly, we have plenty of discoverers who, even in\r\nastronomy, pronounce the learned in error because of mathematics. In\r\nFrance, beyond the sphere of influence of the Academy of Sciences, there is\r\nno one to cast a thought upon the matter: all who take the least interest\r\nrepose entire faith in the Institute. Hence the French discoverer turns all\r\nhis thoughts to the Institute, and looks for his only hearing in that\r\nquarter. He therefore throws no slur upon the means of knowledge, but would\r\nsay, with M. Demonville: \"A l'egard de M. Poisson,[632] j'envie loyalement\r\nla millieme partie de ses connaissances mathematiques, pour prouver mon\r\nsysteme d'astronomie aux plus incredules.\"[633] This system is that the\r\nonly bodies of our system are the earth, the sun, and the moon; all the\r\nothers being illusions, caused by reflection of the sun and moon from the\r\nice of the polar regions. In mathematics, addition and subtraction are for\r\nmen; multiplication and division, which are in truth creation and\r\ndestruction, are prerogatives of deity. But _nothing_ multiplied by\r\n_nothing_ is _one_. M. Demonville obtained an introduction to William the\r\nFourth, who desired the opinion of the Royal Society upon his system: the\r\n{293} answer was very brief. The King was quite right; so was the Society:\r\nthe fault lay with those who advised His Majesty on a matter they knew\r\nnothing about. The writings of M. Demonville in my possession are as\r\nfollows.[634] The dates--which were only on covers torn off in\r\nbinding--were about 1831-34:\r\n\r\n_Petit cours d'astronomie_[635] followed by _Sur l'unite\r\nmathematique._--_Principes de la physique de la creation implicitement\r\nadmis dans la notice sur le tonnerre par M. Arago._--_Question de longitude\r\nsur mer._[636]--_Vrai systeme du monde_[637] (pp. 92). Same title, four\r\npages, small type. Same title, four pages, addressed to the British\r\nAssociation. Same title, four pages, addressed to M. Mathieu. Same title,\r\nfour pages, on M. Bouvard's report.--_Resume de la physique de la creation;\r\ntroisieme partie du vrai systeme du monde._[638]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARSEY'S PARADOX.\r\n\r\n    The quadrature of the circle discovered, by Arthur Parsey,[639] author\r\n    of the 'art of miniature painting.' Submitted to the consideration of\r\n    the Royal Society, on whose protection the author humbly throws\r\n    himself. London, 1832, 8vo.\r\n\r\nMr. Parsey was an artist, who also made himself conspicuous by a new view\r\nof perspective. Seeing that the sides of a tower, for instance, would\r\nappear to meet in a point if the tower were high enough, he thought that\r\nthese sides ought to slope to one another in the picture. On this {294}\r\ntheory he published a small work, of which I have not the title, with a\r\nGrecian temple in the frontispiece, stated, if I remember rightly, to be\r\nthe first picture which had ever been drawn in true perspective. Of course\r\nthe building looked very Egyptian, with its sloping sides. The answer to\r\nhis notion is easy enough. What is called the picture is not the picture\r\nfrom which the mind takes its perception; that picture is on the retina.\r\nThe _intermediate_ picture, as it may be called--the human artist's\r\nwork--is itself seen perspectively. If the tower were so high that the\r\nsides, though parallel, appeared to meet in a point, the picture must also\r\nbe so high that the _picture-sides_, though parallel, would appear to meet\r\nin a point. I never saw this answer given, though I have seen and heard the\r\nremarks of artists on Mr. Parsey's work. I am inclined to think it is\r\ncommonly supposed that the artist's picture is the representation which\r\ncomes before the mind: this is not true; we might as well say the same of\r\nthe object itself. In July 1831, reading an article on squaring the circle,\r\nand finding that there was a difficulty, he set to work, got a light denied\r\nto all mathematicians in--some would say through--a crack, and advertised\r\nin the _Times_ that he had done the trick. He then prepared this work, in\r\nwhich, those who read it will see how, he showed that 3.14159... should be\r\n3.0625. He might have found out his error by _stepping_ a draughtsman's\r\ncircle with the compasses.\r\n\r\nPerspective has not had many paradoxes. The only other one I remember is\r\nthat of a writer on perspective, whose name I forget, and whose four pages\r\nI do not possess. He circulated remarks on my notes on the subject,\r\npublished in the _Athenaeum_, in which he denies that the stereographic\r\nprojection is a case of perspective, the reason being that the whole\r\nhemisphere makes too large a picture for the eye conveniently to grasp at\r\nonce. That is to say, it is no perspective because there is too much\r\nperspective. {295}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON A COUPLE OF GEOMETRIES.\r\n\r\n    Principles of Geometry familiarly illustrated. By the Rev. W.\r\n    Ritchie,[640] LL.D. London, 1833, 12mo.\r\n\r\n    A new Exposition of the system of Euclid's Elements, being an attempt\r\n    to establish his work on a different basis. By Alfred Day,[641] LL.D.\r\n    London, 1839, 12mo.\r\n\r\nThese works belong to a small class which have the peculiarity of insisting\r\nthat in the general propositions of geometry a proposition gives its\r\nconverse: that \"Every B is A\" follows from \"Every A is B.\" Dr. Ritchie\r\nsays, \"If it be proved that the equality of two of the angles of a triangle\r\ndepends _essentially_ upon the equality of the opposite sides, it follows\r\nthat the equality of opposite sides depends _essentially_ on the equality\r\nof the angles.\" Dr. Day puts it as follows:\r\n\r\n\"That the converses of Euclid, so called, where no particular limitation is\r\nspecified or implied in the leading proposition, more than in the converse,\r\nmust be necessarily true; for as by the nature of the reasoning the leading\r\nproposition must be universally true, should the converse be not so, it\r\ncannot be so universally, but has at least all the exceptions conveyed in\r\nthe leading proposition, and the case is therefore unadapted to geometric\r\nreasoning; or, what is the same thing, by the very nature of geometric\r\nreasoning, the particular exceptions to the extended converse must be\r\nidentical with some one or other of the cases under the universal\r\naffirmative proposition with which we set forth, which is absurd.\"\r\n\r\n{296}\r\n\r\nOn this I cannot help transferring to my reader the words of the Pacha when\r\nhe orders the bastinado,--May it do you good! A rational study of logic is\r\nmuch wanted to show many mathematicians, of all degrees of proficiency,\r\nthat there is nothing in the _reasoning_ of mathematics which differs from\r\nother reasoning. Dr. Day repeated his argument in _A Treatise on\r\nProportion_, London, 1840, 8vo. Dr. Ritchie was a very clear-headed man. He\r\npublished, in 1818, a work on arithmetic, with rational explanations. This\r\nwas too early for such an improvement, and nearly the whole of his\r\nexcellent work was sold as waste paper. His elementary introduction to the\r\nDifferential Calculus was drawn up while he was learning the subject late\r\nin life. Books of this sort are often very effective on points of\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEWTON AGAIN OBLITERATED.\r\n\r\n    Letter to the Royal Astronomical Society in refutation of Mistaken\r\n    Notions held in common, by the Society, and by all the Newtonian\r\n    philosophers. By Capt. Forman,[642] R.N. Shepton-Mallet, 1833, 8vo.\r\n\r\nCapt. Forman wrote against the whole system of gravitation, and got no\r\nnotice. He then wrote to Lord Brougham, Sir J. Herschel, and others I\r\nsuppose, desiring them to procure notice of his books in the reviews: this\r\nnot being acceded to, he wrote (in print) to Lord John Russell[643] to\r\ncomplain of their \"dishonest\" conduct. He then sent a manuscript letter to\r\nthe Astronomical Society, inviting controversy: he was answered by a\r\nrecommendation to study {297} dynamics. The above pamphlet was the\r\nconsequence, in which, calling the Council of the Society \"craven dunghill\r\ncocks,\" he set them right about their doctrines. From all I can learn, the\r\nlife of a worthy man and a creditable officer was completely embittered by\r\nhis want of power to see that no person is bound in reason to enter into\r\ncontroversy with every one who chooses to invite him to the field. This\r\nmistake is not peculiar to philosophers, whether of orthodoxy or paradoxy;\r\na majority of educated persons imply, by their modes of proceeding, that no\r\none has a right to any opinion which he is not prepared to defend against\r\nall comers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    David and Goliath, or an attempt to prove that the Newtonian system of\r\n    Astronomy is directly opposed to the Scriptures. By Wm. Lauder,[644]\r\n    Sen., Mere, Wilts. Mere, 1833, 12mo.\r\n\r\nNewton is Goliath; Mr. Lauder is David. David took five pebbles; Mr. Lauder\r\ntakes five arguments. He expects opposition; for Paul and Jesus both met\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nMr. Lauder, in his comparison, seems to put himself in the divinely\r\ninspired class. This would not be a fair inference in every case; but we\r\nknow not what to think when we remember that a tolerable number of\r\ncyclometers have attributed their knowledge to direct revelation. The works\r\nof this class are very scarce; I can only mention one or two from\r\nMontucla.[645] Alphonso Cano de Molina,[646] in the last century, upset all\r\nEuclid, and squared the circle upon the ruins; he found a follower, Janson,\r\nwho translated him from Spanish into Latin. He declared that he believed in\r\nEuclid, until God, who humbles the proud, taught him better. One Paul Yvon,\r\ncalled from his estate de la Leu, a merchant at Rochelle, supported by his\r\nbook-keeper, M. Pujos, and a {298} Scotchman, John Dunbar, solved the\r\nproblem by divine grace, in a manner which was to convert all Jews,\r\nInfidels, etc. There seem to have been editions of his work in 1619 and\r\n1628, and a controversial \"Examen\" in 1630, by Robert Sara. There was a\r\nnoted discussion, in which Mydorge,[647] Hardy,[648] and others took part\r\nagainst de la Leu. I cannot find this name either in Lipenius[649] or\r\nMurhard,[650] and I should not have known the dates if it had not been for\r\none of the keenest bibliographers of any time, my friend Prince Balthasar\r\nBoncompagni,[651] who is trying to find copies of the works, and has\r\nmanaged to find copies of the titles. In 1750, Henry Sullamar, an\r\nEnglishman, squared the circle by the number of the Beast: he published a\r\npamphlet every two or three years; but I cannot find any mention of him in\r\nEnglish works.[652] In France, in 1753, M. de Causans,[653] of the Guards,\r\ncut a circular piece of turf, squared it, and {299} deduced original sin\r\nand the Trinity. He found out that the circle was equal to the square in\r\nwhich it is inscribed; and he offered a reward for detection of any error,\r\nand actually deposited 10,000 francs as earnest of 300,000. But the courts\r\nwould not allow any one to recover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN HERSCHEL.\r\n\r\n1834. In this year Sir John Herschel[654] set up his telescope at\r\nFeldhausen, Cape of Good Hope. He did much for astronomy, but not much for\r\nthe _Budget of Paradoxes_. He gives me, however, the following story. He\r\nshowed a resident a remarkable blood-red star, and some little time after\r\nhe heard of a sermon preached in those parts in which it was asserted that\r\nthe statements of the Bible must be true, for that Sir J. H. had seen in\r\nhis telescope \"the very place where wicked people go.\"\r\n\r\nBut red is not always the color. Sir J. Herschel has in his possession a\r\nletter written to his father, Sir W. H.,[655] dated April 3, 1787, and\r\nsigned \"Eliza Cumyns,\" begging to know if any of the stars be _indigo_ in\r\ncolor, \"because, if there be, I think it may be deemed a strong conjectural\r\nillustration of the expression, so often used by our Saviour in the Holy\r\nGospels, that 'the disobedient shall be cast into outer darkness'; for as\r\nthe Almighty Being can doubtless confine any of his creatures, whether\r\ncorporeal or spiritual, to what part of his creation He pleases, if\r\ntherefore any of the stars (which are beyond all doubt so many suns to\r\nother systems) be of so dark a color as that above mentioned, they may be\r\ncalculated to give the most insufferable heat to those dolorous systems\r\ndependent upon them (and to reprobate spirits placed there), without one\r\nray of cheerful light; and may therefore be the scenes of future\r\npunishments.\" This letter is addressed to Dr. Heirschel at Slow. Some have\r\nplaced the infernal regions inside the earth, but {300} others have filled\r\nthis internal cavity--for cavity they will have--with refulgent light, and\r\nmade it the abode of the blessed. It is difficult to build without knowing\r\nthe number to be provided for. A friend of mine heard the following (part)\r\ndialogue between two strong Scotch Calvinists: \"Noo! hoo manny d'ye thank\r\nthere are of the alact on the arth at this moment?--Eh! mabbee a\r\ndoozen--Hoot! mon! nae so mony as thot!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NAUTICAL ALMANAC.\r\n\r\n1834. From 1769 to 1834 the _Nautical Almanac_ was published on a plan\r\nwhich gradually fell behind what was wanted. In 1834 the new series began,\r\nunder a new superintendent (Lieut. W. S. Stratford).[656] There had been a\r\nlong scientific controversy, which would not be generally intelligible. To\r\nset some of the points before the reader, I reprint a cutting which I have\r\nby me. It is from the Nautical _Magazine_, but I did hear that some had an\r\nidea that it was in the Nautical _Almanac_ itself. It certainly was not,\r\nand I feel satisfied the Lords of the Admiralty would not have permitted\r\nthe insertion; they are never in advance of their age. The Almanac for 1834\r\nwas published in July 1833.\r\n\r\n    THE NEW NAUTICAL ALMANAC--Extract from the 'Primum Mobile,' and 'Milky\r\n    Way Gazette.' Communicated by AEROLITH.\r\n\r\nA meeting of the different bodies composing the Solar System was this day\r\nheld at the Dragon's Tail, for the purpose of taking into consideration the\r\nalterations and amendments introduced into the New Nautical Almanac. The\r\nhonorable luminaries had been individually summoned {301} by fast-sailing\r\ncomets, and there was a remarkably full attendance. Among the visitors we\r\n_observed_ several nebulae, and almost all the stars whose proper motions\r\nwould admit of their being present.\r\n\r\nThe SUN was unanimously called to the focus. The small planets took the\r\noaths, and their places, after a short discussion, in which it was decided\r\nthat the places should be those of the Almanac itself, with leave reserved\r\nto move for corrections.\r\n\r\nPetitions were presented from [alpha] and [delta] Ursae Minoris, complaining\r\nof being put on daily duty, and praying for an increase of salary.--Laid on\r\nthe plane of the ecliptic.\r\n\r\nThe trustees of the eccentricity[657] and inclination funds reported a\r\nbalance of .00001 in the former, and a deficit of 0\".009 in the latter.\r\nThis announcement caused considerable surprise, and a committee was moved\r\nfor, to ascertain which of the bodies had more or less than his share.\r\nAfter some discussion, in which the small planets offered to consent to a\r\nreduction, if necessary, the motion was carried.\r\n\r\nThe FOCAL BODY then rose to address the meeting. He remarked that the\r\nsubject on which they were assembled was one of great importance to the\r\nroutes and revolutions of the heavenly bodies. For himself, though a\r\nprivate arrangement between two of his honourable neighbours (here he\r\nlooked hard at the Earth and Venus) had prevented his hitherto paying that\r\nclose attention to the predictions of the Nautical Almanac which he\r\ndeclared he always had wished to do; yet he felt consoled by knowing that\r\nthe conductors of that work had every disposition to take his peculiar\r\ncircumstances into consideration. He declared that he had never passed the\r\nwires of a transit without deeply feeling his inability to adapt himself to\r\nthe present state of his theory; a feeling which he was afraid had\r\nsometimes caused a slight tremor in his limb. Before {302} he sat down, he\r\nexpressed a hope that honourable luminaries would refrain as much as\r\npossible from eclipsing each other, or causing mutual perturbations.\r\nIndeed, he should be very sorry to see any interruption of the harmony of\r\nthe spheres. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nThe several articles of the New Nautical Almanac were then read over\r\nwithout any comment; only we observed that Saturn shook his ring at every\r\nnovelty, and Jupiter gave his belt a hitch, and winked at the satellites at\r\npage 21 of each month.\r\n\r\nThe MOON rose to propose a resolution. No one, he said, would be surprised\r\nat his bringing this matter forward in the way he did, when it was\r\nconsidered in how complete and satisfactory a manner his motions were now\r\nrepresented. He must own he had trembled when the Lords of the Admiralty\r\ndissolved the Board of Longitude, but his tranquillity was more than\r\nreestablished by the adoption of the new system. He did not know but that\r\nany little assistance he could give in Nautical Astronomy was becoming of\r\nless and less value every day, owing to the improvement of chronometers.\r\nBut there was one thing, of which nothing could deprive him--he meant the\r\nregulation of the tides. And, perhaps, when his attention was not occupied\r\nby more than the latter, he should be able to introduce a little more\r\nregularity into the phenomena. (Here the honourable luminary gave a sort of\r\nmodest libration, which convulsed the meeting with laughter.) They might\r\nlaugh at his natural infirmity if they pleased, but he could assure them it\r\narose only from the necessity he was under, when young, of watching the\r\nmotions of his worthy primary. He then moved a resolution highly laudatory\r\nof the alterations which appeared in the New Nautical Almanac.\r\n\r\nThe EARTH rose, to second the motion. His honourable satellite had fully\r\nexpressed his opinions on the subject. He joined his honourable friend in\r\nthe focus in wishing to pay every attention to the Nautical Almanac, but,\r\n{303} really, when so important an alteration had taken place in his\r\nmagnetic pole[658] (hear) and there might, for aught he knew, be a\r\nsuccessful attempt to reach his pole of rotation, he thought he could not\r\nanswer for the preservation of the precession in its present state. (Here\r\nthe hon. luminary, scratching his side, exclaimed, as he sat down, \"More\r\nsteamboats--confound 'em!\")\r\n\r\nAn honourable satellite (whose name we could not learn) proposed that the\r\nresolution should be immediately despatched, corrected for refraction, when\r\nhe was called to order by the Focal Body, who reminded him that it was\r\ncontrary to the moving orders of the system to take cognizance of what\r\npassed inside the atmosphere of any planet.\r\n\r\nSATURN and PALLAS rose together. (Cries of \"New member!\" and the former\r\ngave way.) The latter, in a long and eloquent speech, praised the\r\nliberality with which he and his colleagues had at length been relieved\r\nfrom astronomical disqualifications. He thought that it was contrary to the\r\nspirit of the laws of gravitation to exclude any planet from office on\r\naccount of the eccentricity or inclination of his orbit. Honourable\r\nluminaries need not talk of the want of convergency of his series. What had\r\nthey to do with any private arrangements between him and the general\r\nequations of the system? (Murmurs from the opposition.) So long as he\r\nobeyed the laws of motion, to which he had that day taken a solemn oath, he\r\nwould ask, were old planets, which were now so well known that nobody\r\ntrusted them, to....\r\n\r\nThe FOCAL BODY said he was sorry to break the continuity of the\r\nproceedings, but he thought that remarks upon character, with a negative\r\nsign, would introduce {304} differences of too high an order. The\r\nhonourable luminary must eliminate the expression which he had brought out,\r\nin finite terms, and use smaller inequalities in future. (Hear, hear.)\r\n\r\nPALLAS explained, that he was far from meaning to reflect upon the orbital\r\ncharacter of any planet present. He only meant to protest against being\r\njudged by any laws but those of gravitation, and the differential calculus:\r\nhe thought it most unjust that astronomers should prevent the small planets\r\nfrom being observed, and then reproach them with the imperfections of the\r\ntables, which were the result of their own narrow-minded policy. (Cheers.)\r\n\r\nSATURN thought that, as an old planet, he had not been treated with due\r\nrespect. (Hear, from his satellites.) He had long foretold the wreck of the\r\nsystem from the friends of innovation. Why, he might ask, were his\r\nsatellites to be excluded, when small planets, trumpery comets, which could\r\nnot keep their mean distances (cries of oh! oh!), double stars, with\r\ngraphical approximations, and such obscure riff-raff of the heavens (great\r\nuproar) found room enough. So help him Arithmetic, nothing could come of\r\nit, but a stoppage of all revolution. His hon. friend in the focus might\r\nsmile, for he would be a gainer by such an event; but as for him (Saturn),\r\nhe had something to lose, and hon. luminaries well knew that, whatever they\r\nmight think _under_ an atmosphere, _above_ it continual revolution was the\r\nonly way of preventing perpetual anarchy. As to the hon. luminary who had\r\nrisen before him, he was not surprised at his remarks, for he had\r\ninvariably observed that he and his colleagues allowed themselves _too much\r\nlatitude_. The stability of the system required that they should be brought\r\ndown, and he, for one, would exert all his powers of attraction to\r\naccomplish that end. If other bodies would cordially unite with him,\r\nparticularly his noble friend next him, than whom no luminary possessed\r\ngreater weight--\r\n\r\nJUPITER rose to order. He conceived his noble friend {305} had no right to\r\nallude to him in that manner, and was much surprised at his proposal,\r\nconsidering the matters which remained in dispute between them. In the\r\npresent state of affairs, he would take care never to be in conjunction\r\nwith his hon. neighbour one moment longer than he could help. (Cries of\r\n\"Order, order, no long inequalities,\" during which he sat down.)\r\n\r\nSATURN proceeded to say, that he did not know till then that a planet with\r\na ring could affront one who had only a belt, by proposing mutual\r\nco-operation. He would now come to the subject under discussion. He should\r\nthink meanly of his hon. colleagues if they consented to bestow their\r\napprobation upon a mere astronomical production. Had they forgotten that\r\nthey once were considered the arbiters of fate, and the prognosticators of\r\nman's destiny? What had lost them that proud position? Was it not the\r\ninfernal march of intellect, which, after having turned the earth\r\ntopsy-turvy, was now disturbing the very universe? For himself (others\r\nmight do as they pleased), but he stuck to the venerable Partridge,[659]\r\nand the Stationers' Company, and trusted that they would outlive infidels\r\nand anarchists, whether of Astronomical or Diffusion of Knowledge\r\nSocieties. (Cries of oh! oh!)\r\n\r\nMARS said he had been told, for he must confess he had not seen the work,\r\nthat the places of the planets were given for Sundays. This, he must be\r\nallowed to say, was an indecorum he had not expected; and he was convinced\r\nthe Lords of the Admiralty had given no orders to that effect. He hoped\r\nthis point would be considered in the measure which had been introduced in\r\nanother place, and that some {306} one would move that the prohibition\r\nagainst travelling on Sundays extend to the heavenly as well as earthly\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the stars here declared, that they had been much annoyed by\r\nbeing observed on Sunday evenings, during the hours of divine service.\r\n\r\nThe room was then cleared for a division, but we are unable to state what\r\ntook place. Several comets-at-arms were sent for, and we heard rumors of a\r\npersonal collision having taken place between two luminaries in opposition.\r\nWe were afterwards told that the resolution was carried by a majority, and\r\nthe luminaries elongated at 2 h. 15 m. 33,41 s. sidereal time.\r\n\r\n* * * It is reported, but we hope without foundation, that Saturn, and\r\nseveral other discontented planets, have accepted an invitation from Sirius\r\nto join his system, on the most liberal appointments. We believe the report\r\nto have originated in nothing more than the discovery of the annual\r\nparallax of Sirius from the orbit of Saturn; but we may safely assure our\r\nreaders that no steps have as yet been taken to open any communication.\r\n\r\nWe are also happy to state, that there is no truth in the rumor of the laws\r\nof gravitation being about to be repealed. We have traced this report, and\r\nfind it originated with a gentleman living near Bath (Captain Forman,\r\nR.N),[660] whose name we forbear to mention.\r\n\r\nA great excitement has been observed among the nebulae, visible to the\r\nearth's southern hemisphere, particularly among those which have not yet\r\nbeen discovered from thence. We are at a loss to conjecture the cause, but\r\nwe shall not fail to report to our readers the news of any movement which\r\nmay take place. (Sir J. Herschel's visit.

(4pp. 12mo.)\r\n\r\nI think this divine system was published several years before, and was\r\nrepublished with an introduction in 1834.[663] Capt. Woodley was very sure\r\nthat the earth does not move: he pointed out to me, in a conversation I had\r\nwith him, something--I forget what--in the motion of the Great Bear,\r\nvisible to any eye, which could not possibly be if the earth moved. He was\r\nexceedingly ignorant, as the following quotation from his account of the\r\nusual opinion will show:\r\n\r\n\"The north pole of the Earth's axis deserts, they say, the north star or\r\npole of the Heavens, at the rate of 1 deg. in 713/4 years.... The fact is,\r\nnothing can be more certain than that the Stars have not changed their\r\nlatitudes or declinations _one degree_ in the last 713/4 years.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a strong specimen of a class of men by whom all accessible persons\r\nwho have made any name in science are hunted. It is a pity that they cannot\r\nbe admitted into scientific societies, and allowed fairly to state their\r\ncases, and stand quiet cross-examination, being kept in their answers very\r\nclose to the questions, and the answers written down. I am perfectly\r\nsatisfied that if one meeting in the year were devoted to the hearing of\r\nthose who chose to come forward on such conditions, much good would be\r\ndone. But I strongly suspect few would come forward {308} at first, and\r\nnone in a little while: and I have had some experience of the method I\r\nrecommend, privately tried. Capt. Woodley was proposed, a little after\r\n1834, as a Fellow of the Astronomical Society; and, not caring whether he\r\nmoved the sun or the earth, or both--I could not have stood _neither_--I\r\nsigned the proposal. I always had a sneaking kindness for paradoxers, such\r\na one, perhaps, as Petit Andre had for his _lambs_, as he called them.\r\nThere was so little feeling against his opinions, that he only failed by a\r\nfraction of a ball. Had I myself voted, he would have been elected; but\r\nbeing engaged in conversation, and not having heard the slightest objection\r\nto him, I did not think it worth while to cross the room for the purpose. I\r\nregretted this at the time, but had I known how ignorant he was I should\r\nnot have supported him. Probably those who voted against him knew more of\r\nhis book than I did.\r\n\r\nI remember no other instance of exclusion from a scientific society on the\r\nground of opinion, even if this be one; of which it may be that ignorance\r\nhad more to do with it than paradoxy. Mr. Frend,[664] a strong\r\nanti-Newtonian, was a Fellow of the Astronomical Society, and for some\r\nyears in the Council. Lieut. Kerigan[665] was elected to the Royal Society\r\nat a time when his proposers must have known that his immediate object was\r\nto put F.R.S. on the title-page of a work against the tides. To give all I\r\nknow, I may add that the editor of some very ignorant bombast about the\r\n\"forehead of the solar sky,\" who did not know the difference between\r\n_Bailly_[666] and _Baily_,[667] received hints which induced him to\r\nwithdraw his proposal for election into the Astronomical Society. But this\r\nwas an act of kindness; {309} for if he had seen Mr. Baily in the chair,\r\nwith his head on, he might have been political historian enough to faint\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    De la formation des Corps.

John Flamsteed,[669] the First\r\n    Astronomer-Royal.... By Francis Baily,[670] Esq. London, 1835, 4to.\r\n    Supplement, London, 1837, 4to.\r\n\r\nMy friend Francis Baily was a paradoxer: he brought forward things counter\r\nto universal opinion. That Newton was impeccable in every point was the\r\nnational creed; and failings of temper and conduct would have been utterly\r\ndisbelieved, if the paradox had not come supported by very unusual\r\nevidence. Anybody who impeached Newton on existing evidence might as well\r\nhave been squaring the circle, for any attention he would have got. About\r\nthis book I will tell a story. It was published by the Admiralty for\r\ndistribution; and the distribution was entrusted to Mr. Baily. On the eve\r\nof its appearance, rumors of its extraordinary revelations got about, and\r\npersons of influence applied to the Admiralty for copies. The Lords were in\r\na difficulty: but on looking at the list they saw names, as they {310}\r\nthought, which were so obscure that they had a right to assume Mr. Baily\r\nhad included persons who had no claim to such a compliment as presentation\r\nfrom the Admiralty. The Secretary requested Mr. Baily to call upon him.\r\n\"Mr. Baily, my Lords are inclined to think that some of the persons in this\r\nlist are perhaps not of that note which would justify their Lordships in\r\npresenting this work.\"--\"To whom does your observation apply, Mr.\r\nSecretary?\"--\"Well, now, let us examine the list; let me see;\r\nnow,--now,--now,--come!--here's Gauss[671]--_who's Gauss_?\"--\"Gauss, Mr.\r\nSecretary, is the oldest mathematician now living, and is generally thought\r\nto be the greatest.\"--\"O-o-oh! Well, Mr. Baily, we will see about it, and I\r\nwill write you a letter.\" The letter expressed their Lordships' perfect\r\nsatisfaction with the list.\r\n\r\nThere was a controversy about the revelations made in this work; but as the\r\neccentric anomalies took no part in it, there is nothing for my purpose.\r\nThe following valentine from Mrs. Flamsteed,[672] which I found among\r\nBaily's papers, illustrates some of the points:\r\n\r\n\"3 Astronomers' Row, Paradise: February 14, 1836.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir,--I suppose you hardly expected to receive a letter from me,\r\ndated from this place; but the truth is, a gentleman from our street was\r\nappointed guardian angel to the American Treaty, in which there is some\r\nastronomical question about boundaries. He has got leave to go back to\r\nfetch some instruments which he left behind, and I take this opportunity of\r\nmaking your acquaintance. That America has become a wonderful place since I\r\nwas down among you; you have no idea how grand the fire at New York {311}\r\nlooked up here. Poor dear Mr. Flamsteed does not know I am writing a letter\r\nto a gentleman on Valentine's day; he is walked out with Sir Isaac Newton\r\n(they are pretty good friends now, though they do squabble a little\r\nsometimes) and Sir William Herschel, to see a new nebula. Sir Isaac says he\r\ncan't make out at all how it is managed; and I am sure I cannot help him. I\r\nnever bothered my head about those things down below, and I don't intend to\r\nbegin here.\r\n\r\n\"I have just received the news of your having written a book about my poor\r\ndear man. It's a chance that I heard it at all; for the truth is, the\r\nscientific gentlemen are somehow or other become so wicked, and go so\r\nlittle to church, that very few of them are considered fit company for this\r\nplace. If it had not been for Dr. Brinkley,[673] who came here of course, I\r\nshould not have heard about it. He seems a nice man, but is not yet used to\r\nour ways. As to Mr. Halley,[674] he is of course not here; which is lucky\r\nfor him, for Mr. Flamsteed swore the moment he caught him in a place where\r\nthere are no magistrates, he would make a sacrifice of him to heavenly\r\ntruth. It was very generous in Mr. F. not appearing against Sir Isaac when\r\nhe came up, for I am told that if he had, Sir Isaac would not have been\r\nallowed to come in at all. I should have been sorry for that, for he is a\r\ncompanionable man enough, only holds his head rather higher than he should\r\ndo. I met him the other day walking with Mr. Whiston,[675] and disputing\r\nabout the deluge. 'Well, Mrs. Flamsteed,' says he, 'does old Poke-the-Stars\r\nunderstand gravitation yet?' Now you must know that is rather a sore point\r\nwith poor dear Mr. Flamsteed. He says that Sir Isaac is as crochetty about\r\nthe moon as ever; and as to {312} what some people say about what has been\r\ndone since his time, he says he should like to see somebody who knows\r\nsomething about it of himself. For it is very singular that none of the\r\npeople who have carried on Sir Isaac's notions have been allowed to come\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you have not forgotten to tell how badly Sir Isaac used Mr.\r\nFlamsteed about that book. I have never quite forgiven him; as for Mr.\r\nFlamsteed, he says that as long as he does not come for observations, he\r\ndoes not care about it, and that he will never trust him with any papers\r\nagain as long as he lives. I shall never forget what a rage he came home in\r\nwhen Sir Isaac had called him a puppy. He struck the stairs all the way up\r\nwith his crutch, and said puppy at every step, and all the evening, as soon\r\nas ever a star appeared in the telescope, he called it puppy. I could not\r\nthink what was the matter, and when I asked, he only called me puppy.\r\n\r\n\"I shall be very glad to see you if you come our way. Pray keep up some\r\nappearances, and go to church a little. St. Peter is always uncommonly\r\ncivil to astronomers, and indeed to all scientific persons, and never\r\nbothers them with many questions. If they can make anything out of the\r\ncase, he is sure to let them in. Indeed, he says, it is perfectly out of\r\nthe question expecting a mathematician to be as religious as an apostle,\r\nbut that it is as much as his place is worth to let in the greater number\r\nof those who come. So try if you cannot manage it, for I am very curious to\r\nknow whether you found all the letters. I remain, dear sir, your faithful\r\nservant,\r\n\r\n\"MARGARET FLAMSTEED.\r\n\r\n  Francis Baily, Esq.\r\n\r\n\"P.S. Mr. Flamsteed has come in, and says he left Sir Isaac riding\r\ncockhorse upon the nebula, and poring over it as if it were a book. He has\r\nbrought in his old acquaintance Ozanam,[676] who says that it was always\r\nhis maxim on {313} earth, that 'il appartient aux docteurs de Sorbonne de\r\ndisputer, au Pape de prononcer, et au mathematicien d'aller en Paradis en\r\nligne perpendiculaire.'\"[677]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON STEVIN.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Admiralty was completely extinguished. I can recall\r\nbut two instances of demolition as complete, though no doubt there are many\r\nothers. The first is in\r\n\r\n  Simon Stevin[678] and M. Dumortier. Nieuport, 1845, 12mo.\r\n\r\nM. Dumortier was a member of the Academy of Brussels: there was a\r\ndiscussion, I believe, about a national Pantheon for Belgium. The name of\r\nStevinus suggested itself as naturally as that of Newton to an Englishman;\r\nprobably no Belgian is better known to foreigners as illustrious in\r\nscience. Stevinus is great in the _Mecanique Analytique_ of Lagrange;[679]\r\nStevinus is great in the _Tristram Shandy_ of Sterne. M. Dumortier, who\r\nbelieved that not one Belgian in a thousand knew Stevinus, and who\r\nconfesses with ironical shame that he was not the odd man, protested\r\nagainst placing the statue of an obscure man in the Pantheon, to give\r\nforeigners the notion that Belgium could show nothing greater. The work\r\nabove named is a slashing retort: any one who knows the history of science\r\never so little may imagine what a dressing was given, by mere extract from\r\nforeign writers. The tract is a letter signed J. du Fan, but this is a\r\npseudonym of Mr. Van de Weyer.[680] The Academician says Stevinus was a man\r\nwho was not {314} without merit for the time at which he lived: Sir! is the\r\nanswer, he was as much before his own time as you are behind yours. How\r\ncame a man who had never heard of Stevinus to be a member of the Brussels\r\nAcademy?\r\n\r\nThe second story was told me by Mr. Crabb Robinson,[681] who was long\r\nconnected with the _Times_, and intimately acquainted with Mr. W***.[682]\r\nWhen W*** was an undergraduate at Cambridge, taking a walk, he came to a\r\nstile, on which sat a bumpkin who did not make way for him: the gown in\r\nthat day looked down on the town. \"Why do you not make way for a\r\ngentleman?\"--\"Eh?\"--\"Yes, why do you not move? You deserve a good hiding,\r\nand you shall get it if you don't take care!\" The bumpkin raised his\r\nmuscular figure on its feet, patted his menacer on the head, and said, very\r\nquietly,--\"Young man! I'm Cribb.\"[683] W*** seized the great pugilist's\r\nhand, and shook it warmly, got him to his own rooms in college, collected\r\nsome friends, and had a symposium which lasted until the large end of the\r\nsmall hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINLEYSON AS A PARADOXER.\r\n\r\n    God's Creation of the Universe as it is, in support of the Scriptures.\r\n    By Mr. Finleyson.[684] Sixth Edition, 1835, 8vo.\r\n\r\n{315}\r\n\r\nThis writer, by his own account, succeeded in delivering the famous Lieut.\r\nRichard Brothers[685] from the lunatic asylum, and tending him, not as a\r\nkeeper but as a disciple, till he died. Brothers was, by his own account,\r\nthe nephew of the Almighty, and Finleyson ought to have been the nephew of\r\nBrothers. For Napoleon came to him in a vision, with a broken sword and an\r\narrow in his side, beseeching help: Finleyson pulled out the arrow, but\r\nrefused to give a new sword; whereby poor Napoleon, though he got off with\r\nlife, lost the battle of Waterloo. This story was written to the Duke of\r\nWellington, ending with \"I pulled out the arrow, but left the broken sword.\r\nYour Grace can supply the rest, and what followed is amply recorded in\r\nhistory.\" The book contains a long account of applications to Government to\r\ndo three things: to pay 2,000l. for care taken of Brothers, to pay 10,000l.\r\nfor discovery of the longitude, and to prohibit the teaching of the\r\nNewtonian system, which makes God a liar. The successive administrations\r\nwere threatened that they would have to turn out if they refused, which, it\r\nis remarked, came to pass in every case. I have heard of a joke of Lord\r\nMacaulay, that the House of Commons must be the Beast of the Revelations,\r\nsince 658 members, with the officers necessary for the action of the House,\r\nmake 666. Macaulay read most things, and the greater part of the rest: so\r\nthat he might be suspected of having appropriated as a joke one of\r\nFinleyson's serious points--\"I wrote Earl Grey[686] upon the 13th of July,\r\n1831, informing him that his Reform {316} Bill could not be carried, as it\r\nreduced the members below the present amount of 658, which, with the eight\r\nprincipal clerks or officers of the House, make the number 666.\" But a\r\nwitness has informed me that Macaulay's joke was made in his hearing a\r\ngreat many years before the Reform Bill was proposed; in fact, when both\r\nwere students at Cambridge. Earl Grey was, according to Finleyson, a\r\ndescendant of Uriah the Hittite. For a specimen of Lieut. Brothers, this\r\nbook would be worth picking up. Perhaps a specimen of the Lieutenant's\r\npoetry may be acceptable: Brothers _loquitur_, remember:\r\n\r\n \"Jerusalem ! Jerusalem! shall be built again!\r\n    More rich, more grand then ever;\r\n  And through it shall Jordan flow!(!)\r\n    My people's favourite river.\r\n  There I'll erect a splendid throne,\r\n    And build on the wasted place;\r\n  To fulfil my ancient covenant\r\n    To King David and his race.\r\n      *    *    *    *    *    *\r\n \"Euphrates' stream shall flow with ships,\r\n    And also my wedded Nile;\r\n  And on my coast shall cities rise,\r\n    Each one distant but a mile.\r\n      *    *    *    *    *    *\r\n \"My friends the Russians on the north\r\n    With Persees and Arabs round,\r\n  Do show the limits of my land,\r\n    Here! Here! then I mark the ground.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THEOLOGICAL PARADOXERS.\r\n\r\nAmong the paradoxers are some of the theologians who in their own organs of\r\nthe press venture to criticise science. These may hold their ground when\r\nthey confine themselves to the geology of long past periods and to general\r\ncosmogony: for it is the tug of Greek against Greek; and both sides deal\r\nmuch in what is grand when called _hypothesis_, petty when called\r\n_supposition_. And very often they are not conspicuous when they venture\r\nupon things within knowledge; {317} wrong, but not quite wrong enough for a\r\nBudget of Paradoxes. One case, however, is destined to live, as an instance\r\nof a school which finds writers, editors, and readers. The double stars\r\nhave been seen from the seventeenth century, and diligently observed by\r\nmany from the time of Wm. Herschel, who first devoted continuous attention\r\nto them. The year 1836 was that of a remarkable triumph of astronomical\r\nprediction. The theory of gravitation had been applied to the motion of\r\nbinary stars about each other, in elliptic orbits, and in that year the two\r\nstars of [gamma] Virginis, as had been predicted should happen within a few\r\nyears of that time--for years are small quantities in such long\r\nrevolutions--the two stars came to their nearest: in fact, they appeared to\r\nbe one as much with the telescope as without it. This remarkable\r\nturning-point of the history of a long and widely-known branch of astronomy\r\nwas followed by an article in the _Church of England Quarterly Review_ for\r\nApril 1837, written against the Useful Knowledge Society. The notion that\r\nthere are any such things as double stars is (p. 460) implied to be\r\nimposture or delusion, as in the following extract. I suspect that I myself\r\nam the _Sidrophel_, and that my companion to the maps of the stars, written\r\nfor the Society and published in 1836, is the work to which the writer\r\nrefers:\r\n\r\n\"We have forgotten the name of that Sidrophel who lately discovered that\r\nthe fixed stars were not single stars, but appear in the heavens like soles\r\nat Billingsgate, in pairs; while a second astronomer, under the influence\r\nof that competition in trade which the political economists tell us is so\r\nadvantageous to the public, professes to show us, through his superior\r\ntelescope, that the apparently single stars are really three. Before such\r\nwondrous mandarins of science, how continually must _homunculi_ like\r\nourselves keep in the background, lest we come between the wind and their\r\nnobility.\"\r\n\r\nIf the _homunculus_ who wrote this be still above ground, {318} how\r\ndevoutly must he hope he may be able to keep in the background! But the\r\nchief blame falls on the editor. The title of the article is:\r\n\r\n\"The new school of superficial pantology; a speech intended to be delivered\r\nbefore a defunct Mechanics' Institute. By Swallow Swift, late M.P. for the\r\nBorough of Cockney-Cloud, Witsbury: reprinted Balloon Island, Bubble year,\r\nmonth _Ventose_. Long live Charlatan!\"\r\n\r\nAs a rule, orthodox theologians should avoid humor, a weapon which all\r\nhistory shows to be very difficult to employ in favor of establishment, and\r\nwhich, nine times out of ten, leaves its wielder fighting on the side of\r\nheterodoxy. Theological argument, when not enlivened by bigotry, is seldom\r\nworse than narcotic: but theological fun, when not covert heresy, is almost\r\nalways sialagogue. The article in question is a craze, which no editor\r\nshould have admitted, except after severe inspection by qualified persons.\r\nThe author of this wit committed a mistake which occurs now and then in old\r\nsatire, the confusion between himself and the party aimed at. He ought to\r\nbe reviewing this fictitious book, but every now and then the article\r\nbecomes the book itself; not by quotation, but by the writer forgetting\r\nthat _he_ is not Mr. Swallow Swift, but his reviewer. In fact he and Mr. S.\r\nSwift had each had a dose of the _Devil's Elixir_. A novel so called,\r\npublished about forty years ago, proceeds upon a legend of this kind. If\r\ntwo parties both drink of the elixir, their identities get curiously\r\nintermingled; each turns up in the character of the other throughout the\r\nthree volumes, without having his ideas clear as to whether he be himself\r\nor the other. There is a similar confusion in the answer made to the famous\r\n_Epistolae Obscurorum Virorum_:[687] it is headed _Lamentationes Obscurorum\r\nVirorum_.[688] {319} This is not a retort of the writer, throwing back the\r\nimputation: the obscure men who had been satirized are themselves made, by\r\nname, to wince under the disapprobation which the Pope had expressed at the\r\nsatire upon themselves.\r\n\r\nOf course the book here reviewed is a transparent forgery. But I do not\r\nknow how often it may have happened that the book, in the journals which\r\nalways put a title at the head, may have been written after the review.\r\nAbout the year 1830 a friend showed me the proof of an article of his on\r\nthe malt tax, for the next number of the _Edinburgh Review_. Nothing was\r\nwanting except the title of the book reviewed; I asked what it was. He sat\r\ndown, and wrote as follows at the head, \"The Maltster's Guide (pp. 124),\"\r\nand said that would do as well as anything.\r\n\r\nBut I myself, it will be remarked, have employed such humor as I can\r\ncommand \"in favor of establishment.\" What it is worth I am not to judge; as\r\nusual in such cases, those who are of my cabal pronounce it good, but\r\ncyclometers and other paradoxers either call it very poor, or commend it as\r\nsheer buffoonery. Be it one or the other, I observe that all the effective\r\nridicule is, in this subject, on the side of establishment. This is partly\r\ndue to the difficulty of quizzing plain and sober demonstration; but so\r\nmuch, if not more, to the ignorance of the paradoxers. For that which\r\ncannot be _ridiculed_, can be _turned into ridicule_ by those who know how.\r\nBut by the time a person is deep enough in _negative_ quantities, and\r\n_impossible_ quantities, to be able to satirize them, he is caught, and\r\nbeing inclined to become a _user_, shrinks from being an _abuser_. Imagine\r\na person with a gift of ridicule, and knowledge enough, trying his hand on\r\nthe junction of the assertions which he will find in various books of\r\nalgebra. First, that a negative quantity has no logarithm; secondly, that a\r\n{320} negative quantity has no square root; thirdly, that the first\r\nnon-existent is to the second as the circumference of a circle to its\r\ndiameter. One great reason of the allowance of such unsound modes of\r\nexpression is the confidence felt by the writers that [root]-1 and log(-1)\r\nwill make their way, however inaccurately described. I heartily wish that\r\nthe cyclometers had knowledge enough to attack the weak points of\r\nalgebraical diction: they would soon work a beneficial change.[689]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EARLY METEOROLOGIST.\r\n\r\n    Recueil de ma vie, mes ouvrages et mes pensees. Par Thomas Ignace Marie\r\n    Forster.[690] Brussels, 1836, 12mo.\r\n\r\nMr. Forster, an Englishman settled at Bruges, was an observer in many\r\nsubjects, but especially in meteorology. He communicated to the\r\nAstronomical Society, in 1848, the information that, in the registers kept\r\nby his grandfather, his father, and himself, beginning in 1767, new moon on\r\nSaturday was followed, nineteen times out of twenty, by twenty days of rain\r\nand wind. This statement being published in the _Athenaeum_, a cluster of\r\ncorrespondents averred that the belief is common among seamen, in all parts\r\nof the world, and among landsmen too. Some one quoted a distich:\r\n\r\n \"Saturday's moon and Sunday's full\r\n  Never were fine and never _wull_.\"\r\n\r\n{321} Another brought forward:\r\n\r\n \"If a Saturday's moon\r\n  Comes once in seven years it comes too soon.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Forster did not say he was aware of the proverbial character of the\r\nphenomenon. He was a very eccentric man. He treated his dogs as friends,\r\nand buried them with ceremony. He quarrelled with the _cure_ of his parish,\r\nwho remarked that he could not take his dogs to heaven with him. I will go\r\nnowhere, said he, where I cannot take my dog. He was a sincere Catholic:\r\nbut there is a point beyond which even churches have no influence.\r\n\r\nThe following is some account of the announcement of 1849. The _Athenaeum_\r\n(Feb. 17), giving an account of the meeting of the Astronomical Society in\r\nDecember, 1858, says:\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Forster of Bruges, who is well known as a meteorologist, made a\r\ncommunication at which our readers will stare: he declares that by journals\r\nof the weather kept by his grandfather, father, and himself, ever since\r\n1767, to the present time, _whenever the new moon has fallen on a Saturday,\r\nthe following twenty days have been wet and windy_, in nineteen cases out\r\nof twenty. In spite of our friend Zadkiel[691] and the others who declare\r\nthat we would smother every truth that does not happen to agree with us, we\r\nare glad to see that the Society had the sense to publish this\r\ncommunication, coming, as it does, from a veteran observer, and one whose\r\nlove of truth is undoubted. It must be that the fact is so set down in the\r\njournals, because Dr. Forster says it: and whether it be only a fact of the\r\njournals, or one of the heavens, can soon be tried. The new moon of March\r\nnext, falls on _Saturday_ the 24th, at 2 in the afternoon. We shall\r\ncertainly look out.\"\r\n\r\n{322}\r\n\r\nThe following appeared in the number of March 31:\r\n\r\n\"The first _Saturday Moon_ since Dr. Forster's announcement came off a week\r\nago. We had previously received a number of letters from different\r\ncorrespondents--all to the effect that the notion of new moon on Saturday\r\nbringing wet weather is one of widely extended currency. One correspondent\r\n(who gives his name) states that he has constantly heard it at sea, and\r\namong the farmers and peasantry in Scotland, Ireland, and the North of\r\nEngland. He proceeds thus: 'Since 1826, nineteen years of the time I have\r\nspent in a seafaring life. I have constantly observed, though unable to\r\naccount for, the phenomenon. I have also heard the stormy qualities of a\r\nSaturday's moon remarked by American, French, and Spanish seamen; and,\r\nstill more distant, a Chinese pilot, who was once doing duty on board my\r\nvessel seemed to be perfectly cognizant of the fact.' So that it seems we\r\nhave, in giving currency to what we only knew as a very curious\r\ncommunication from an earnest meteorologist, been repeating what is common\r\nenough among sailors and farmers. Another correspondent affirms that the\r\nthing is most devoutly believed in by seamen; who would as soon sail on a\r\nFriday as be in the Channel after a Saturday moon.--After a tolerable\r\ncourse of dry weather, there was some snow, accompanied by wind on Saturday\r\nlast, here in London; there were also heavy louring clouds. Sunday was\r\ncloudy and cold, with a little rain; Monday was louring, Tuesday unsettled;\r\nWednesday quite overclouded, with rain in the morning. The present occasion\r\nshows only a general change of weather with a tendency towards rain. If Dr.\r\nForster's theory be true, it is decidedly one of the minor instances, as\r\nfar as London weather is concerned.--It will take a good deal of evidence\r\nto make us believe in the omen of a Saturday Moon. But, as we have said of\r\nthe Poughkeepsie Seer, the thing is very curious whether true or false.\r\nWhence comes this universal proverb--and a hundred others--while the\r\nmeteorological observer {323} cannot, when he puts down a long series of\r\nresults, detect any weather cycles at all? One of our correspondents wrote\r\nus something of a lecture for encouraging, he said, the notion that _names_\r\ncould influence the weather. He mistakes the question. If there be any\r\nweather cycles depending on the moon, it is possible that one of them may\r\nbe so related to the week cycle of seven days, as to show recurrences which\r\nare of the kind stated, or any other. For example, we know that if the new\r\nmoon of March fall on a Saturday in this year, it will most probably fall\r\non a Saturday nineteen years hence. This is not connected with the spelling\r\nof Saturday--but with the connection between the motions of the sun and\r\nmoon. Nothing but the Moon can settle the question--and we are willing to\r\nwait on her for further information. If the adage be true, then the\r\nphilosopher has missed what lies before his eyes; if false, then the world\r\ncan be led by the nose in spite of the eyes. Both these things happen\r\nsometimes; and we are willing to take whichever of the two solutions is\r\nborne out by future facts. In the mean time, we announce the next Saturday\r\nMoon for the 18th of August.\"\r\n\r\nHow many coincidences are required to establish a law of connection? It\r\ndepends on the way in which the mind views the matter in question. Many of\r\nthe paradoxers are quite set up by a very few instances. I will now tell a\r\nstory about myself, and then ask them a question.\r\n\r\nSo far as instances can prove a law, the following is proved: no failure\r\nhas occurred. Let a clergyman be known to me, whether by personal\r\nacquaintance or correspondence, or by being frequently brought before me by\r\nthose with whom I am connected in private life: that clergyman does not,\r\nexcept in few cases, become a bishop; but _if_ he become a bishop, he is\r\nsure, first or last, to become an arch-bishop. This has happened in every\r\ncase. As follows:\r\n\r\n1. My last schoolmaster, a former Fellow of Oriel, was {324} a very\r\nintimate college friend of Richard Whately[692], a younger man. Struck by\r\nhis friend's talents, he used to talk of him perpetually, and predict his\r\nfuture eminence. Before I was sixteen, and before Whately had even given\r\nhis Bampton Lectures, I was very familiar with his name, and some of his\r\nsayings. I need not say that he became Archbishop of Dublin.\r\n\r\n2. When I was a child, a first cousin of John Bird Sumner[693] married a\r\nsister of my mother. I cannot remember the time when I first heard his\r\nname, but it was made very familiar to me. In time he became Bishop of\r\nChester, and then, Archbishop of Canterbury. My reader may say that Dr.\r\nC. R. Sumner,[694] Bishop of Winchester, has just as good a claim: but it\r\nis not so: those connected with me had more knowledge of Dr. J. B.\r\nSumner;[695] and said nothing, or next to nothing, of the other. Rumor says\r\nthat the Bishop of Winchester has _declined_ an Archbishopric: if so, my\r\nrule is a rule of gradations.\r\n\r\n3. Thomas Musgrave,[696] Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, was _Dean_\r\nof the college when I was an undergraduate: this brought me into connection\r\nwith him, he giving impositions for not going to chapel, I writing them out\r\naccording. We had also friendly intercourse in after life; I forgiving, he\r\nprobably forgetting. Honest Tom {325} Musgrave, as he used to be called,\r\nbecame Bishop of Hereford, and Archbishop of York.\r\n\r\n4. About the time when I went to Cambridge, I heard a great deal about Mr.\r\nC. T. Longley,[697] of Christchurch, from a cousin of my own of the same\r\ncollege, long since deceased, who spoke of him much, and most\r\naffectionately. Dr. Longley passed from Durham to York, and thence to\r\nCanterbury. I cannot quite make out the two Archbishoprics; I do not\r\nremember any other private channel through which the name came to me:\r\nperhaps Dr. Longley, having two strings to his bow, would have been one\r\narchbishop if I had never heard of him.\r\n\r\n5. When Dr. Wm. Thomson[698] was appointed to the see of Gloucester in\r\n1861, he and I had been correspondents on the subject of logic--on which we\r\nhad both written--for about fourteen years. On his elevation I wrote to\r\nhim, giving the preceding instances, and informing him that he would\r\ncertainly be an Archbishop. The case was a strong one, and the law acted\r\nrapidly; for Dr. Thomson's elevation to the see of York took place in 1862.\r\n\r\nHere are five cases; and there is no opposing instance. I have searched the\r\nalmanacs since 1828, and can find no instance of a Bishop not finally\r\nArchbishop of whom I had known through private sources, direct or indirect.\r\nNow what do my paradoxers say? Is this a pre-established harmony, or a\r\nchain of coincidences? And how many instances will it require to establish\r\na law?[699]\r\n\r\n{326}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HERSCHEL HOAX.\r\n\r\n    Some account of the great astronomical discoveries lately made by Sir\r\n    John Herschel at the Cape of Good Hope. Second Edition. London, 12mo.\r\n    1836.\r\n\r\nThis is a curious hoax, evidently written by a person versed in astronomy\r\nand clever at introducing probable circumstances and undesigned\r\ncoincidences.[700] It first appeared in a newspaper. It makes Sir J.\r\nHerschel discover men, animals, etc. in the moon, of which much detail is\r\ngiven. There seems to have been a French edition, the original, and English\r\neditions in America, whence the work came into Britain: but whether the\r\nFrench was published in America or at Paris I do not know. There is no\r\ndoubt that it was produced in the United States, by M. Nicollet,[701] an\r\nastronomer, once of Paris, and a fugitive of some kind. About him I have\r\nheard two stories. First that he fled to America with funds not his own,\r\nand that this book was a mere device to raise the wind. Secondly, that he\r\nwas a protege of Laplace, and of the Polignac party, and also an outspoken\r\nman. That after the revolution he was so obnoxious to the republican party\r\nthat he judged it prudent to quit France; which he did in debt, leaving\r\nmoney for his creditors, but not enough, with M. Bouvard. In America he\r\nconnected himself with an assurance office. {327} The moon-story was\r\nwritten, and sent to France, chiefly with the intention of entrapping M.\r\nArago, Nicollet's especial foe, into the belief of it. And those who\r\nnarrate this version of the story wind up by saying that M. Arago _was_\r\nentrapped, and circulated the wonders through Paris, until a letter from\r\nNicollet to M. Bouvard[702] explained the hoax. I have no personal\r\nknowledge of either story: but as the poor man had to endure the first, it\r\nis but right that the second should be told with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME MORE METEOROLOGY.\r\n\r\n    The Weather Almanac for the Year 1838. By P. Murphy,[703] Esq., M.N.S.\r\n\r\nBy M. N. S. is meant _member of no society._. This almanac bears on the\r\ntitle-page two recommendations. The _Morning Post_ calls it one of the most\r\nimportant-if-true publications of our generation. The _Times_ says: \"If the\r\nbasis of his theory prove sound, and its principles be sanctioned by a more\r\nextended experience, it is not too much to say that the importance of the\r\ndiscovery is equal to that of the longitude.\" Cautious journalist! Three\r\ntimes that of the longitude would have been too little to say. That the\r\nlandsman might predict the weather of all the year, at its beginning, Jack\r\nwould cheerfully give up astronomical longitude--_the_ problem--altogether,\r\nand fall back on chronometers with the older Ls, lead, latitude, and\r\nlook-out, applied to dead-reckoning. Mr. Murphy attempted to give the\r\nweather day by day: thus the first seven days of March {328} bore\r\nChangeable; Rain; Rain; Rain-_wind_; Changeable; Fair; Changeable. To aim\r\nat such precision as to put a fair day between two changeable ones by\r\nweather theory was going very near the wind and weather too. Murphy opened\r\nthe year with cold and frost; and the weather did the same. But Murphy,\r\nopposite to Saturday, January 20, put down \"Fair, Probable lowest degree of\r\nwinter temperature.\" When this Saturday came, it was not merely the\r\nprobably coldest of 1838, but certainly the coldest of many consecutive\r\nyears. Without knowing anything of Murphy, I felt it prudent to cover my\r\nnose with my glove as I walked the street at eight in the morning. The\r\nfortune of the Almanac was made. Nobody waited to see whether the future\r\nwould dement the prophecy: the shop was beset in a manner which brought the\r\npolice to keep order; and it was said that the Almanac for 1838 was a gain\r\nof 5,000l. to the owners. It very soon appeared that this was only a lucky\r\nhit: the weather-prophet had a modified reputation for a few years; and is\r\nnow no more heard of. A work of his will presently appear in the list.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT PYRAMIDS.\r\n\r\n    Letter from Alexandria on the evidence of the practical application of\r\n    the quadrature of the circle in the great pyramids of Gizeh. By H. C.\r\n    Agnew,[704] Esq. London, 1838, 4to.\r\n\r\n{329}\r\n\r\nMr. Agnew detects proportions which he thinks were suggested by those of\r\nthe circumference and diameter of a circle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MATHEMATICS OF A CREED.\r\n\r\n    The creed of St. Athanasius proved by a mathematical parallel. Before\r\n    you censure, condemn, or approve; read, examine, and understand. E. B.\r\n    REVILO.[705] London, 1839, 8vo.\r\n\r\nThis author really believed himself, and was in earnest. He is not the only\r\nperson who has written nonsense by confounding the mathematical infinite\r\n(of quantity) with what speculators now more correctly express by the\r\nunlimited, the unconditioned, or the absolute. This tract is worth\r\npreserving, as the extreme case of a particular kind. The following is a\r\nspecimen. Infinity being represented by [infinity], as usual, and f, s, g,\r\nbeing finite integers, the three Persons are denoted by [infinity]^{f}, (m\r\n[infinity])^{s}, [infinity]^{g}, the finite fraction m representing human\r\nnature, as opposed to [infinity]. The clauses of the Creed are then given\r\nwith their mathematical parallels. I extract a couple:\r\n\r\n \"But the Godhead of the\r\n  Father, of the Son, and of\r\n  the Holy Ghost, is all one:\r\n  the glory equal, the Majesty\r\n  co-eternal.\r\n\r\n \"It has been shown that\r\n  [infinity]^f, [infinity]^g, and (m [infinity])^s, together,\r\n  are but [infinity], and that\r\n  each is [infinity], and any magnitude\r\n  in existence represented\r\n  by [infinity] always was and always\r\n  will be: for it cannot\r\n  be made, or destroyed, and\r\n  yet exists.\r\n\r\n{330}\r\n\r\n \"Equal to the Father, as\r\n  touching his Godhead: and\r\n  inferior  to the  Father,\r\n  touching his Manhood.\"\r\n\r\n \"(m [infinity])^s is equal to [infinity]^f as\r\n  touching [infinity], but inferior to\r\n  [infinity]^f as touching m: because\r\n  m is not infinite.\"\r\n\r\nI might have passed this over, as beneath even my present subject, but for\r\nthe way in which I became acquainted with it. A bookseller, _not the\r\npublisher_, handed it to me over his counter: one who had published\r\nmathematical works. He said, with an air of important communication, Have\r\nyou seen _this_, Sir! In reply, I recommended him to show it to my friend\r\nMr.----, for whom he had published mathematics. Educated men, used to books\r\nand to the converse of learned men, look with mysterious wonder on such\r\nproductions as this: for which reason I have made a quotation which many\r\nwill judge had better have been omitted. But it would have been an\r\nimposition on the public if I were, omitting this and some other uses of\r\nthe Bible and Common Prayer, to pretend that I had given a true picture of\r\nmy school.\r\n\r\n[Since the publication of the above, it has been stated that the author is\r\nMr. Oliver Byrne, the author of the _Dual Arithmetic_ mentioned further on:\r\nE. B. Revilo seems to be obviously a reversal.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOGIC HAS NO PARADOXERS.\r\n\r\n    Old and new logic contrasted: being an attempt to elucidate, for\r\n    ordinary comprehension, how Lord Bacon delivered the human mind from\r\n    its 2,000 years' enslavement under Aristotle. By Justin Brenan.[706]\r\n    London, 1839, 12mo.\r\n\r\nLogic, though the other exact science, has not had the sort of assailants\r\nwho have clustered about mathematics. There is a sect which disputes the\r\nutility of logic, but there are no special points, like the quadrature of\r\nthe circle, which {331} excite dispute among those who admit other things.\r\nThe old story about Aristotle having one logic to trammel us, and Bacon\r\nanother to set us free,--always laughed at by those who really knew either\r\nAristotle or Bacon,--now begins to be understood by a large section of the\r\neducated world. The author of this tract connects the old logic with the\r\nindecencies of the classical writers, and the new with moral purity: he\r\nappeals to women, who, \"when they see plainly the demoralizing tendency of\r\nsyllogistic logic, they will no doubt exert their powerful influence\r\nagainst it, and support the Baconian method.\" This is the only work against\r\nlogic which I can introduce, but it is a rare one, I mean in contents. I\r\nquote the author's idea of a syllogism:\r\n\r\n\"The basis of this system is the syllogism. This is a form of couching the\r\nsubstance of your argument or investigation into one short line or\r\nsentence--then corroborating or supporting it in another, and drawing your\r\nconclusion or proof in a third.\"\r\n\r\nOn this definition he gives an example, as follows: \"Every sin deserves\r\ndeath,\" the substance of the \"argument or investigation.\" Then comes,\r\n\"Every unlawful wish is a sin,\" which \"corroborates or supports\" the\r\npreceding: and, lastly, \"therefore every unlawful wish deserves death,\"\r\nwhich is the \"conclusion or proof.\" We learn, also, that \"sometimes the\r\nfirst is called the premises (_sic_), and sometimes the first premiss\"; as\r\nalso that \"the first is sometimes called the proposition, or subject, or\r\naffirmative, and the next the predicate, and sometimes the middle term.\" To\r\nwhich is added, with a mark of exclamation at the end, \"but in analyzing\r\nthe syllogism, there is a middle term, and a predicate too, in each of the\r\nlines!\" It is clear that Aristotle never enslaved this mind.\r\n\r\nI have said that logic has no paradoxers, but I was speaking of old time.\r\nThis science has slept until our own day: Hamilton[707] says there has been\r\n\"no progress made in {332} the _general_ development of the syllogism since\r\nthe time of Aristotle; and in regard to the few _partial_ improvements, the\r\nprofessed historians seem altogether ignorant.\" But in our time, the\r\nparadoxer, the opponent of common opinion, has appeared in this field. I do\r\nnot refer to Prof. Boole,[708] who is not a _paradoxer_, but a\r\n_discoverer_: his system could neither oppose nor support common opinion,\r\nfor its grounds were not in the conception of any one. I speak especially\r\nof two others, who fought like cat and dog: one was dogmatical, the other\r\ncategorical. The first was Hamilton himself--Sir William Hamilton of\r\nEdinburgh, the metaphysician, not Sir William _Rowan_ Hamilton[709] of\r\nDublin, the mathematician, a combination of peculiar genius with\r\nunprecedented learning, erudite in all he could want except mathematics,\r\nfor which he had no turn, and in which he had not even a schoolboy's\r\nknowledge, thanks to the Oxford of his younger day. The other was the\r\nauthor of this work, so fully described in Hamilton's writings that there\r\nis no occasion to describe him here. I shall try to say a few words in\r\ncommon language about the paradoxers.\r\n\r\nHamilton's great paradox was the _quantification of the predicate_; a\r\nfearful phrase, easily explained. We all know that when we say \"Men are\r\nanimals,\" a form wholly unquantified in phrase, we speak of _all_ men, but\r\nnot of all animals: it is _some or all_, some may be all for aught the\r\nproposition says. This some-may-be-all-for-aught-we-say, or _not-none,_ is\r\nthe logician's _some_. One would suppose {333} that \"all men are some\r\nanimals,\" would have been the logical phrase in all time: but the predicate\r\nnever was quantified. The few who alluded to the possibility of such a\r\nthing found reasons for not adopting it over and above the great reason,\r\nthat Aristotle did not adopt it. For Aristotle never ruled in physics or\r\nmetaphysics _in the old time_ with near so much of absolute sway as he has\r\nruled in logic _down to our own time_. The logicians knew that in the\r\nproposition \"all men are animals\" the \"animal\" is not _universal_, but\r\n_particular_ yet no one dared to say that _all_ men are _some_ animals, and\r\nto invent the phrase, \"_some_ animals are _all_ men\" until Hamilton leaped\r\nthe ditch, and not only completed a system of enunciation, but applied it\r\nto syllogism.\r\n\r\nMy own case is as peculiar as his: I have proposed to introduce\r\nmathematical _thought_ into logic to an extent which makes the old stagers\r\ncry:\r\n\r\n \"St. Aristotle! what wild notions!\r\n  Serve a _ne exeat regno_[710] on him!\"\r\n\r\nHard upon twenty years ago, a friend and opponent who stands high in these\r\nmatters, and who is not nearly such a sectary of Aristotle and\r\nestablishment as most, wrote to me as follows: \"It is said that next to the\r\nman who forms the taste of the nation, the greatest genius is the man who\r\ncorrupts it. I mean therefore no disrespect, but very much the reverse,\r\nwhen I say that I have hitherto always considered you as a great logical\r\nheresiarch.\" Coleridge says he thinks that it was Sir Joshua Reynolds who\r\nmade the remark: which, to copy a bull I once heard, I cannot deny, because\r\nI was not there when he said it. My friend did not call me to repentance\r\nand reconciliation with the church: I think he had a guess that I was a\r\nreprobate sinner. My offences at that time were but small: I went on\r\nspinning syllogism systems, all alien from the common logic, until I had\r\nsix, the initial letters of which, put together, from the {334} names I\r\ngave before I saw what they would make, bar all repentance by the words\r\n\r\n  RUE NOT!\r\n\r\nleaving to the followers of the old school the comfortable option of\r\nplacing the letters thus:\r\n\r\n  TRUE? NO!\r\n\r\nIt should however be stated that the question is not about absolute truth\r\nor falsehood. No one denies that anything I call an inference is an\r\ninference: they say that my alterations are _extra-logical_; that they are\r\n_material_, not _formal_; and that logic is a _formal_ science.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between material and formal is easily made, where the usual\r\nperversions are not required. A _form_ is an empty machine, such as \"Every\r\nX is Y\"; it may be supplied with _matter_, as in \"Every _man_ is _animal_.\"\r\nThe logicians will not see that their _formal_ proposition, \"Every X is Y,\"\r\nis material in three points, the degree of assertion, the quantity of the\r\nproposition, and the copula. The purely formal proposition is \"There is the\r\nprobability [alpha] that X stands in the relation L to Y.\" The time will\r\ncome when it will be regretted that logic went without paradoxers for two\r\nthousand years: and when much that has been said on the distinction of form\r\nand matter will breed jokes.\r\n\r\nI give one instance of one mood of each of the systems, in the order of the\r\nletters first written above.\r\n\r\n_Relative._--In this system the formal relation is taken, that is, the\r\ncopula may be any whatever. As a material instance, in which the\r\n_relations_ are those of consanguinity (of men understood), take the\r\nfollowing: X is the brother of Y; X is not the uncle of Z; therefore, Z is\r\nnot the child of Y. The discussion of relation, and of the objections to\r\nthe extension, is in the _Cambridge Transactions_, Vol. X, Part 2; a\r\ncrabbed conglomerate.\r\n\r\n_Undecided._--In this system one premise, and want of power over another,\r\ninfer want of power over a conclusion. {335} As \"Some men are not capable\r\nof tracing consequences; we cannot be sure that there are beings\r\nresponsible for consequences who are incapable of tracing consequences;\r\ntherefore, we cannot be sure that all men are responsible for the\r\nconsequences of their actions.\"\r\n\r\n_Exemplar._--This, long after it suggested itself to me as a means of\r\ncorrecting a defect in Hamilton's system, I saw to be the very system of\r\nAristotle himself, though his followers have drifted into another. It makes\r\nits subject and predicate examples, thus: Any one man is an animal; any one\r\nanimal is a mortal; therefore, any one man is a mortal.\r\n\r\n_Numerical._--Suppose 100 Ys to exist: then if 70 Xs be Ys, and 40 Zs be\r\nYs, it follows that 10 Xs (at least) are Zs. Hamilton, whose mind could not\r\ngeneralize on symbols, saw that the word _most_ would come under this\r\nsystem, and admitted, as valid, such a syllogism as \"most Ys are Xs; most\r\nYs are Zs; therefore, some Xs are Zs.\"\r\n\r\n_Onymatic._--This is the ordinary system much enlarged in propositional\r\nforms. It is fully discussed in my _Syllabus of Logic_.\r\n\r\n_Transposed._--In this syllogism the quantity in one premise is transposed\r\ninto the other. As, some Xs are not Ys; for every X there is a Y which is\r\nZ; therefore, some Zs are not Xs.\r\n\r\nSir William Hamilton of Edinburgh was one of the best friends and allies I\r\never had. When I first began to publish speculation on this subject, he\r\nintroduced me to the logical world as having plagiarized from him. This\r\ndrew their attention: a mathematician might have written about logic under\r\nforms which had something of mathematical look long enough before the\r\nAristotelians would have troubled themselves with him: as was done by John\r\nBernoulli,[711] {336} James Bernoulli,[712] Lambert,[713] and\r\nGergonne;[714] who, when our discussion began, were not known even to\r\nomnilegent Hamilton. He retracted his accusation of _wilful_ theft in a\r\nmanly way when he found it untenable; but on this point he wavered a\r\nlittle, and was convinced to the last that I had taken his principle\r\nunconsciously. He thought I had done the same with Ploucquet[715] and\r\nLambert. It was his pet notion that I did not understand the commonest\r\nprinciples of logic, that I did not always know the difference between the\r\nmiddle term of a syllogism and its conclusion. It went against his grain to\r\nimagine that a mathematician could be a logician. So long as he took me to\r\nbe riding my own hobby, he laughed consumedly: but when he thought he could\r\nmake out that I was mounted behind Ploucquet or Lambert, the current ran\r\nthus: \"It would indeed have been little short of a miracle had he, ignorant\r\neven of the common principles of logic, been able of himself to rise to\r\ngeneralization so lofty and so accurate as are supposed in the peculiar\r\ndoctrines of both the rival logicians, Lambert and Ploucquet--how useless\r\nsoever these may in practice prove to be.\" All this has been sufficiently\r\ndiscussed elsewhere: \"but, masters, remember that I am an ass.\"\r\n\r\nI know that I never saw Lambert's work until after all Hamilton supposed me\r\nto have taken was written: he himself, who read almost everything, knew\r\nnothing about it until after I did. I cannot prove what I say about my\r\nknowledge of Lambert: but the means of doing it may turn up. For, by the\r\ncasual turning up of an old letter, I _have_ {337} found the means of\r\nclearing myself as to Ploucquet. Hamilton assumed that (unconsciously) I\r\ntook from Ploucquet the notion of a logical notation in which the symbol of\r\nthe conclusion is seen in the joint symbols of the premises. For example,\r\nin my own fashion I write down ( . ) ( . ), two symbols of premises. By\r\nthese symbols I see that there is a valid conclusion, and that it may be\r\nwritten in symbol by striking out the two middle parentheses, which gives (\r\n. . ) and reading the two negative dots as an affirmative. And so I see in\r\n( . ) ( . ) that ( ) is the conclusion. This, in full, is the perception\r\nthat \"all are either Xs or Ys\" and \"all are either Ys or Zs\" necessitates\r\n\"some Xs are Zs.\" Now in Ploucquet's book of 1763, is found, \"Deleatur in\r\npraemissis medius; id quod restat indicat conclusionem.\"[716] In the paper\r\nin which I explain my symbols--which are altogether different from\r\nPloucquet's--there is found \"Erase the symbols of the middle term; the\r\nremaining symbols show the inference.\" There is very great likeness: and I\r\nwould have excused Hamilton for his notion if he had fairly given reference\r\nto the part of the book in which his quotation was found. For I had shown\r\nin my _Formal Logic_ what part of Ploucquet's book I had used: and a fair\r\ndisputant would either have strengthened his point by showing that I had\r\nbeen at his part of the book, or allowed me the advantage of it being\r\napparent that I had not given evidence of having seen that part of the\r\nbook. My good friend, though an honest man, was sometimes unwilling to\r\nallow due advantage to controversial opponents.\r\n\r\nBut to my point. The only work of Ploucquet I ever saw was lent me by my\r\nfriend Dr. Logan,[717] with whom I have often corresponded on logic, etc. I\r\nchanced (in 1865) {338} to turn up the letter which he sent me (Sept. 12,\r\n1847) _with the book_. Part of it runs thus: \"I congratulate you on your\r\nsuccess in your logical researches [that is, in asking for the book, I had\r\ndescribed some results]. Since the reading of your first paper I have been\r\nsatisfied as to the possibility of inventing a logical notation in which\r\nthe rationale of the inference is contained in the symbol, though I never\r\nattempted to verify it [what I communicated, then, satisfied the writer\r\nthat I had done and communicated what he, from my previous paper, suspected\r\nto be practicable]. I send you Ploucquet's dissertation....'\r\n\r\nIt now being manifest that I cannot be souring grapes which have been taken\r\nfrom me, I will say what I never said in print before. There is not the\r\nslightest merit in making the symbols of the premises yield that of the\r\nconclusion by erasure: _the thing must do itself in every system which\r\nsymbolises quantities_. For in every syllogism (except the inverted\r\n_Bramantip_ of the Aristotelians) the conclusion is manifest in this way\r\nwithout symbols. This _Bramantip_ destroys system in the Aristotelian lot:\r\nand circumstances which I have pointed out destroy it in Hamilton's own\r\ncollection. But in that enlargement of the reputed Aristotelian system\r\nwhich I have called _onymatic_, and in that correction of Hamilton's system\r\nwhich I have called _exemplar_, the rule of erasure is universal, and may\r\nbe seen without symbols.\r\n\r\nOur first controversy was in 1846. In 1847, in my _Formal Logic_, I gave\r\nhim back a little satire for satire, just to show, as I stated, that I\r\ncould employ ridicule if I pleased. He was so offended with the appendix in\r\nwhich this was contained, that he would not accept the copy of the book I\r\nsent him, but returned it. Copies of controversial works, sent from\r\nopponent to opponent, are not _presents_, in the usual sense: it was a\r\nmarked success to make him angry enough to forget this. It had some effect\r\nhowever: during the rest of his life I wished to avoid provocation; for I\r\n{339} could not feel sure that excitement might not produce consequences. I\r\nallowed his slashing account of me in the _Discussions_ to pass unanswered:\r\nand before that, when he proposed to open a controversy in the _Athenaeum_\r\nupon my second Cambridge paper, I merely deferred the dispute until the\r\nnext edition of my _Formal Logic_. I cannot expect the account in the\r\n_Discussions_ to amuse an unconcerned reader as much as it amused myself:\r\nbut for a cut-and-thrust, might-and-main, tooth-and-nail, hammer-and-tongs\r\nassault, I can particularly recommend it. I never knew, until I read it,\r\nhow much I should enjoy a thundering onslought on myself, done with racy\r\ninsolence by a master hand, to whom my good genius had whispered _Ita feri\r\nut se sentiat emori_.[718] Since that time I have, as the Irishman said,\r\nbecome \"dry moulded for want of a bating.\" Some of my paradoxers have done\r\ntheir best: but theirs is mere twopenny--\"small swipes,\" as Peter Peebles\r\nsaid. Brandy for heroes! I hope a reviewer or two will have mercy on me,\r\nand will give me as good discipline as Strafford would have given Hampden\r\nand his set: \"much beholden,\" said he, \"should they be to any one that\r\nshould thoroughly take pains with them in that kind\"--meaning _objective_\r\nflagellation. And I shall be the same to any one who will serve me so--but\r\nin a literary and periodical sense: my corporeal cuticle is as thin as my\r\nneighbors'.\r\n\r\nSir W. H. was suffering under local paralysis before our controversy\r\ncommenced: and though his mind was quite unaffected, a retort of as\r\ndownright a character as the attack might have produced serious effect upon\r\na person who had shown himself sensible of ridicule. Had a second attack of\r\nhis disorder followed an answer from me, I should have been held to have\r\ncaused it: though, looking at Hamilton's genial love of combat, I strongly\r\nsuspected that a retort in kind\r\n\r\n{340}\r\n\r\n \"Would cheer his heart, and warm his blood,\r\n  And make him fight, and do him good.\"\r\n\r\nBut I could not venture to risk it. So all I did, in reply to the article\r\nin the _Discussions_, was to write to him the following note: which, as\r\nillustrating an etiquette of controversy, I insert.\r\n\r\n\"I beg to acknowledge and thank you for.... It is necessary that I should\r\nsay a word on my retention of this work, with reference to your return of\r\nthe copy of my _Formal Logic_, which I presented to you on its publication:\r\na return made on the ground of your disapproval of the account of our\r\ncontroversy which that work contained. According to my view of the subject,\r\nany one whose dealing with the author of a book is specially attacked in\r\nit, has a right to expect from the author that part of the book in which\r\nthe attack is made, together with so much of the remaining part as is\r\nfairly context. And I hold that the acceptance by the party assailed of\r\nsuch work or part of a work does not imply any amount of approval of the\r\ncontents, or of want of disapproval. On this principle (though I am not\r\nprepared to add the word _alone_) I forwarded to you the whole of my work\r\non _Formal Logic_ and my second Cambridge Memoir. And on this principle I\r\nshould have held you wanting in due regard to my literary rights if you had\r\nnot forwarded to me your asterisked pages, with all else that was necessary\r\nto a full understanding of their scope and meaning, so far as the contents\r\nof the book would furnish it. For the remaining portion, which it would be\r\na hundred pities to separate from the pages in which I am directly\r\nconcerned, I am your debtor on another principle; and shall be glad to\r\nremain so if you will allow me to make a feint of balancing the account by\r\nthe offer of two small works on subjects as little connected with our\r\ndiscussion as the _Epistolae Obscurorum Virorum_, or the Lutheran dispute. I\r\ntrust that by accepting my _Opuscula_ you will enable me to avoid the {341}\r\nuse of the knife, and leave me to cut you up with the pen as occasion shall\r\nserve, I remain, etc. (April 21, 1852).\"\r\n\r\nI received polite thanks, but not a word about the body of the letter: my\r\nargument, I suppose, was admitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME DOGGEREL AND COUNTER DOGGEREL.\r\n\r\nI find among my miscellaneous papers the following _jeu d'esprit_, or _jeu\r\nde betise_,[719] whichever the reader pleases--I care not--intended, before\r\nI saw ground for abstaining, to have, as the phrase is, come in somehow. I\r\nthink I could manage to bring anything into anything: certainly into a\r\nBudget of Paradoxes. Sir W. H. rather piqued himself upon some caniculars,\r\nor doggerel verses, which he had put together _in memoriam_ [_technicam_]\r\nof the way in which A E I O are used in logic: he added U, Y, for the\r\naddition of _meet_, etc., to the system. I took the liberty of concocting\r\nsome counter-doggerel, just to show that a mathematician may have\r\narchitectonic power as well as a metaphysician.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          DOGGEREL.\r\n      BY SIR W.  HAMILTON.\r\n  A it affirms of _this_, _these_, _all_,\r\n    Whilst E denies of _any_;\r\n  I it affirms (whilst O denies)\r\n    Of some (or few, or many).\r\n\r\n  Thus A affirms, as E denies,\r\n    And definitely either;\r\n  Thus I affirms, as O denies,\r\n    And definitely neither.\r\n\r\n  A half, left semidefinite,\r\n    Is worthy of its score;\r\n  U, then, affirms, as Y denies,\r\n    This, neither less nor more.\r\n\r\n  Indefinito-definites,\r\n    I, UI, YO, last we come;\r\n  {342}\r\n  And this affirms, as that denies\r\n    Of _more_, _most_ (_half_, _plus_, _some_).\r\n\r\n    COUNTER DOGGEREL.\r\n      BY PROF.

And I say it is: and will take no denial.\r\n\r\nLong live--long will live--the glad memory of William Hamilton, Good,\r\nLearned, Acute, and Disputatious! He fought upon principle: the motto of\r\nhis book is:\r\n\r\n \"Truth, like a torch, the more it's shook it shines.\"\r\n\r\nThere is something in this; but metaphors, like puddings, quarrels, rivers,\r\nand arguments, always have two sides to them. For instance,\r\n\r\n \"Truth, like a torch, the more it's shook it shines;\r\n    But those who want to use it, hold it steady.\r\n  They shake the flame who like a glare to gaze at,\r\n    They keep it still who want a light to see by.\"\r\n\r\n{344}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER THEORY OF PARALLELS.\r\n\r\n    Theory of Parallels. The proof of Euclid's axiom looked for in the\r\n    properties of the Equiangular Spiral. By Lieut-Col. G. Perronet\r\n    Thompson.[721] The same, second edition, revised and corrected. The\r\n    same, third edition, shortened, and freed from dependence on the theory\r\n    of limits. The same, fourth edition, ditto, ditto. All London, 1840,\r\n    8vo.\r\n\r\nTo explain these editions it should be noted that General Thompson rapidly\r\nmodified his notions, and republished his tracts accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME PRIMITIVE DARWINISM.\r\n\r\n    Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation.[722] London, 1840, 12mo.\r\n\r\nThis is the first edition of this celebrated work. Its form is a case of\r\nthe theory: the book is an undeniable duodecimo, but the size of its paper\r\ngives it the look of not the smallest of octavos. Does not this illustrate\r\nthe law of development, the gradation of families, the transference of\r\nspecies, and so on? If so, I claim the discovery of this esoteric testimony\r\nof the book to its own contents; I defy any one to point out the reviewer\r\nwho has mentioned it. The work itself is described by its author as \"the\r\nfirst attempt to connect the natural sciences into a history of creation.\"\r\nThe attempt was commenced, and has been carried on, both with marked\r\ntalent, and will be continued. Great advantage will result: at the worst we\r\nare but in the alchemy of some new chemistry, or the astrology of some new\r\nastronomy. Perhaps it would be as well not to be too sure on the matter,\r\nuntil we have an antidote to possible consequences as exhibited under\r\nanother theory, on which {345} it is as reasonable to speculate as on that\r\nof the _Vestiges_. I met long ago with a splendid player on the guitar, who\r\nassured me, and was confirmed by his friends, that he _never practised_,\r\nexcept in thought, and did not possess an instrument: he kept his fingers\r\nacting in his mind, until they got their habits; and thus he learnt the\r\nmost difficult novelties of execution. Now what if this should be a minor\r\nsegment of a higher law? What if, by constantly thinking of ourselves as\r\ndescended from primeval monkeys, we should--if it be true--actually _get\r\nour tails again_? What if the first man who was detected with such an\r\nappendage should be obliged to confess himself the author of the\r\n_Vestiges_--a person yet unknown--who would naturally get the start of his\r\nspecies by having had the earliest habit of thinking on the matter? I\r\nconfess I never hear a man of note talk fluently about it without a curious\r\nglance at his proportions, to see whether there may be ground to conjecture\r\nthat he may have more of \"mortal coil\" than others, in anaxyridical\r\nconcealment. I do not feel sure that even a paternal love for his theory\r\nwould induce him, in the case I am supposing, to exhibit himself at the\r\nBritish Association,\r\n\r\n  With a hole behind which his tail peeped through.\r\n\r\nThe first sentence of this book (1840) is a cast of the log, which shows\r\nour rate of progress. \"It is familiar knowledge that the earth which we\r\ninhabit is a globe of somewhat less than 8,000 miles in diameter, being one\r\nof a series of eleven which revolve at different distances around the sun.\"\r\nThe _eleven_! Not to mention the Iscariot which Le Verrier and Adams\r\ncalculated into existence, there is more than a septuagint of _new_\r\nplanetoids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON RELIGIOUS INSURANCE.\r\n\r\n    The Constitution and Rules of the Ancient and Universal 'Benefit\r\n    Society' established by Jesus Christ, exhibited, and its advantages and\r\n    claims maintained, against all Modern and {346} merely Human\r\n    Institutions of the kind: A Letter very respectfully addressed to the\r\n    Rev. James Everett,[723] and occasioned by certain remarks made by him,\r\n    in a speech to the Members of the 'Wesleyan Centenary Institute'\r\n    Benefit Society. Dated York, Dec. 7, 1840. By Thomas Smith.[724] 12mo,\r\n    (pp. 8.)\r\n\r\nThe Wesleyan minister addressed had advocated provision against old age,\r\netc.: the writer declares all _private_ provision un-Christian. After\r\ndecent maintenance and relief of family claims of indigence, he holds that\r\nall the rest is to go to the \"Benefit Society,\" of which he draws up the\r\nrules, in technical form, with chapters of \"Officers,\" \"Contributors\" etc.,\r\nfrom the Acts of the Apostles, etc., and some of the early Fathers. He\r\nholds that a Christian may not \"make a _private_ provision against the\r\ncontingencies of the future\": and that the great \"Benefit Society\" is the\r\ndivinely-ordained recipient of all the surplus of his income; capital,\r\nbeyond what is necessary for business, he is to have none. A real good\r\nspeculator shuts his eyes by instinct, when opening them would not serve\r\nthe purpose: he has the vizor of the Irish fairy tale, which fell of itself\r\nover the eyes of the wearer the moment he turned them upon the enchanted\r\nlight which would have destroyed him if he had caught sight of it. \"Whiles\r\nit remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it (the\r\npurchase-money) not in thine own power?\" would have been awkward to quote,\r\nand accordingly nothing is stated except the well-known result, which is\r\nrule 3, cap. 5, \"Prevention of Abuses.\" By putting his principles together,\r\nthe author can be made, logically, to mean that the successors of the\r\napostles should put to death all contributors who are detected in not\r\npaying their full premiums.\r\n\r\n{347}\r\n\r\nI have known one or two cases in which policy-holders have surrendered\r\ntheir policies through having arrived at a conviction that direct provision\r\nis unlawful. So far as I could make it out, these parties did not think it\r\nunlawful to lay by out of income, except when this was done in a manner\r\nwhich involved calculation of death-chances. It is singular they did not\r\nsee that the entrance of chance of death was the entrance of the very\r\nprinciple of the benefit society described in the Acts of the Apostles. The\r\nfamily of the one who died young received more in proportion to _premiums_\r\npaid than the family of one who died old. Every one who understands life\r\nassurance sees that--_bonus_ apart--the difference between an assurance\r\noffice and a savings bank consists in the adoption, _pro tanto_, of the\r\nprinciple of community of goods. In the original constitution of the oldest\r\nassurance office, the _Amicable Society_, the plan with which they started\r\nwas nothing but this: persons of all ages under forty-five paid one common\r\npremium, and the proceeds were divided among the representatives of those\r\nwho died within the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWO OLD PARADOXES AGAIN.\r\n\r\n[I omitted from its proper place a manuscript quadrature (3.1416 exactly)\r\naddressed to an eminent mathematician, dated in 1842 from the debtor's ward\r\nof a country gaol. The unfortunate speculator says, \"I have labored many\r\nyears to find the precise ratio.\" I have heard of several cases in which\r\nsquaring the circle has produced an inability to square accounts. I remind\r\nthose who feel a kind of inspiration to employ native genius upon\r\ndifficulties, without gradual progression from elements, that the call is\r\none which becomes stronger and stronger, and may lead, as it has led, to\r\nabandonment of the duties of life, and all the consequences.] {348}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    1842.

He had need have both, for he shows that the line which\r\nhas a square equal to a given circle, has a cube equal to the sphere on the\r\nsame diameter: that is, in old mathematics, the diameter is to the\r\ncircumference as 9 to 16! Again, admitting that the velocities of planets\r\nin circular orbits are inversely as the square roots of their distances,\r\nthat is, admitting Kepler's law, he manages to prove that gravitation is\r\ninversely as the square _root_ of the distance: and suspects magnetism of\r\ndoing the difference between this and Newton's law. {349} Magnetism and\r\nelectricity are, in physics, the member of parliament and the cabman--at\r\nevery man's bidding, as Henry Warburton[727] said.\r\n\r\nThe above is an outrageous quadrature. In the preceding year, 1841, was\r\npublished what I suppose at first to be a Maori quadrature, by Maccook. But\r\nI get it from a cutting out of some French periodical, and I incline to\r\nthink that it must be by a Mr. M^cCook. He makes [pi] to be 2 +\r\n2[root](8[root]2 - 11).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DUPLICATION PROBLEM.\r\n\r\n    Refutation of a Pamphlet written by the Rev.

By Robert\r\n    Murphy.[729] Mallow, 1824, 12mo.\r\n\r\nThis refutation was the production of an Irish boy of eighteen years old,\r\nself-educated in mathematics, the son of a shoemaker at Mallow. He died in\r\n1843, leaving a name which is well known among mathematicians. His works on\r\nthe theory of equations and on electricity, and his papers in the\r\n_Cambridge Transactions_, are all of high genius. The only account of him\r\nwhich I know of is that which I wrote for the _Supplement_ of the _Penny\r\nCyclopaedia_. He was thrown by his talents into a good income at Cambridge,\r\nwith no social training except penury, and very little intellectual\r\ntraining except mathematics. He fell into dissipation, and his scientific\r\ncareer was almost arrested: but he had great good in him, to my knowledge.\r\nA sentence in {350} a letter from the late Dean Peacock[730] to me--giving\r\nsome advice about the means of serving Murphy--sets out the old case:\r\n\"Murphy is a man whose _special_ education is in advance of his _general_;\r\nand such men are almost always difficult subjects to manage.\" This article\r\nhaving been omitted in its proper place, I put it at 1843, the date of\r\nMurphy's death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW VALUE OF [pi].\r\n\r\n    The Invisible Universe disclosed; or, the real Plan and Government of\r\n    the Universe.

Printed for the\r\n    London Society, Exeter Hall. Price Sixpence. (n. d. 1843.)\r\n\r\nWhat this London Society was, or the \"combination,\" did not appear. There\r\nwas a remarkable comet in 1843, the tail of which was at first confounded\r\nwith what is called the _zodiacal light_. This nicely-printed little tract,\r\nevidently got up with less care for expense than is usual in such works,\r\nbrings together all the announcements of the astronomers, and adds a short\r\nhead and tail piece, which I shall quote entire. As the announcements are\r\nvery ordinary {351} astronomy, the reader will be able to detect, if\r\ndetection be possible, what is the meaning and force of the \"Combination of\r\nthe Zodiacal and Cometical Systems\":\r\n\r\n\"_Premonition._ It has pleased the AUTHOR _of_ CREATION to cause (to His\r\n_human and reasoning_ Creatures of this generation, by a '_combined_'\r\nappearance in His _Zodiacal_ and _Cometical_ system) a '_warning Crisis_'\r\nof universal concernment to this our GLOBE. It is this '_Crisis_' that has\r\nso generally 'ROUSED' at this moment the '_nations throughout the Earth_'\r\nthat no equal interest has ever before been excited by MAN; unless it be in\r\nthat caused by the 'PAGAN-TEMPLE IN ROME,' which is recorded by the elder\r\nPliny, '_Nat. Hist._' i. 23. iii. 3.

A chronological panic was beginning in December 1844,\r\nwhich was stopped by the _Times_ newspaper printing extracts from an\r\narticle of mine in the _Companion to the Almanac_ for 1845, which had then\r\njust appeared. No one had guessed the true reason, which is that the thing\r\ncalled the moon in the Gregorian Calendar is not the moon of the heavens,\r\nbut a fictitious imitation put wrong on purpose, as will presently appear,\r\npartly to keep Easter out of the way of the Jews' Passover, partly for\r\nconvenience of calculation. The apparent error happens but rarely; and all\r\nthe work will perhaps have to be gone over next time. I now give two bits\r\nof paradox.\r\n\r\nSome theologians were angry at this explanation. A review called the\r\n_Christian Observer_ (of which Christianity I do not know) got up a\r\ncrushing article against me. I did not look at it, feeling sure that an\r\narticle on such a subject which appeared on January 1, 1845, against a\r\npublication made in December 1844, must be a second-hand job. But some\r\nyears afterwards (Sept. 10, 1850), the reviews, etc. having been just\r\nplaced at the disposal of readers in the _old_ reading-room of the Museum,\r\nI made a tour of inspection, came upon my critic on his perch, and took a\r\nlook at him. I was very glad to remember this, for, though expecting only\r\nsecond-hand, yet even of this there is good and bad; and I expected to find\r\nsome hints in the good second-hand of a respectable clerical publication. I\r\nread on, therefore, attentively, but not long: I soon came to the\r\ninformation that some additions to Delambre's[739] statement of the rule\r\nfor finding Easter, belonging to distant years, had been made by Sir Harris\r\nNicolas![740] Now as I myself furnished my friend Sir H. N. with Delambre's\r\ndigest of {355} Clavius's[741] rule, which I translated out of algebra into\r\ncommon language for the purpose, I was pretty sure this was the ignorant\r\nreading of a person to whom Sir H. N. was the highest _arithmetical_\r\nauthority on the subject. A person pretending to chronology, without being\r\nable to distinguish the historical points--so clearly as they stand out--in\r\nwhich Sir H. N. speaks with authority, from the arithmetical points of pure\r\nreckoning on which he does not pretend to do more than directly repeat\r\nothers, must be as fit to talk about the construction of Easter Tables as\r\nthe Spanish are to talk French. I need hardly say that the additions for\r\ndistant years are as much from Clavius as the rest: my reviewer was not\r\ndeep enough in his subject to know that Clavius made and published, from\r\nhis rules, the full table up to A.D. 5000, for all the movable feasts of\r\nevery year! I gave only a glance at the rest: I found I was either knave or\r\nfool, with a leaning to the second opinion; and I came away satisfied that\r\nmy critic was either ignoramus or novice, with a leaning to the first. I\r\nafterwards found an ambiguity of expression in Sir H. N.'s account--whether\r\nhis or mine I could not tell--which might mislead a novice or content an\r\nignoramus, but would have been properly read or further inquired into by a\r\ncompetent person.\r\n\r\nThe second case is this. Shortly after the publication of my article, a\r\ngentleman called at my house, and, finding I was not at home, sent up his\r\ncard--with a stylish west-end club on it--to my wife, begging for a few\r\nwords on pressing business. With many well-expressed apologies, he stated\r\nthat he had been alarmed by hearing that Prof. De M. had an intention of\r\naltering Easter next year. Mrs. De M. kept her countenance, and assured him\r\nthat I had no such intention, and further, that she greatly doubted my\r\nhaving the power to do it. Was she quite sure? his authority was very good:\r\nfresh assurances given. He was greatly relieved, for he had some horses\r\ntraining for after Easter, which {356} would not be ready to run if it were\r\naltered the wrong way. A doubt comes over him: would Mrs. De M., in the\r\nevent of her being mistaken, give him the very earliest information?\r\nPromise given; profusion of thanks; more apologies; and departure.\r\n\r\nNow, candid reader!--or uncandid either!--which most deserves to be laughed\r\nat? A public instructor, who undertakes to settle for the world whether a\r\nreader of Clavius, the constructor of the Gregorian Calendar, is fool or\r\nknave, upon information derived from a compiler--in this matter--of his own\r\nday; or a gentleman of horse and dog associations, who, misapprehending\r\nsomething which he heard about a current topic, infers that the reader of\r\nClavius had the ear of the Government on a proposed alteration. I suppose\r\nthe querist had heard some one say, perhaps, that the day ought to be set\r\nright, and some one else remark that I might be consulted, as the only\r\nperson who had discussed the matter from the original source of the\r\nCalendar.\r\n\r\nTo give a better chance of the explanation being at once produced, next\r\ntime the real full moon and Easter Day shall fall together, I insert here a\r\nsummary which was printed in the Irish Prayer-book of the Ecclesiastical\r\nSociety. If the amusement given by paradoxers should prevent a useless\r\ndiscussion some years hence, I and the paradoxers shall have done a little\r\ngood between us--at any rate, I have done my best to keep the heavy weight\r\nafloat by tying bladders to it. I think the next occurrence will be in\r\n1875.\r\n\r\nEASTER DAY.\r\n\r\nIn the years 1818 and 1845, Easter Day, as given by the _rules in_ 24 Geo.\r\nII cap. 23. (known as the act for the _change of style_) contradicted the\r\n_precept_ given in the preliminary explanations. The precept is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"_Easter Day_, on which the rest\" of the moveable feasts \"depend, is always\r\nthe First Sunday after the Full Moon, which happens upon or next after the\r\nTwenty-first Day of {357} _March_; and if the Full Moon happens upon a\r\nSunday, _Easter Day_ is the Sunday after.\"\r\n\r\nBut in 1818 and 1845, the full moon fell on a Sunday, and yet the rules\r\ngave _that same Sunday_ for Easter Day. Much discussion was produced by\r\nthis circumstance in 1818: but a repetition of it in 1845 was nearly\r\naltogether prevented by a timely[742] reference to the intention of those\r\nwho conducted the Gregorian reformation of the Calendar. Nevertheless,\r\nseeing that the apparent error of the Calendar is due to the precept in the\r\nAct of Parliament, which is both erroneous and insufficient, and that the\r\ndifficulty will recur so often as Easter Day falls on the day of full moon,\r\nit may be advisable to select from the two articles cited in the note such\r\nof their conclusions and rules, without proof or controversy, as will\r\nenable the reader to understand the main points of the Easter question,\r\nand, should he desire it, to calculate for himself the Easter of the old or\r\nnew style, for any given year.\r\n\r\n1. In the very earliest age of Christianity, a controversy arose as to the\r\nmode of keeping Easter, some desiring to perpetuate the _Passover_, others\r\nto keep the _festival of the Resurrection_. The first afterwards obtained\r\nthe name of _Quartadecimans_, from their Easter being always kept on the\r\n_fourteenth day_ of the moon (Exod. xii. 18, Levit. xxiii. 5.). But though\r\nit is unquestionable that a Judaizing party existed, it is also likely that\r\nmany dissented on chronological grounds. It is clear that no _perfect_\r\nanniversary can take place, except when the fourteenth of the moon, and\r\nwith it the passover, falls on a Friday. Suppose, for instance, it falls on\r\na Tuesday: one of three things must be {358} done. Either (which seems\r\nnever to have been proposed) the crucifixion and resurrection must be\r\ncelebrated on Tuesday and Sunday, with a wrong interval; or the former on\r\nTuesday, the latter on Thursday, abandoning the first day of the week; or\r\nthe former on Friday, and the latter on Sunday, abandoning the paschal\r\ncommemoration of the crucifixion.\r\n\r\nThe last mode has been, as every one knows, finally adopted. The disputes\r\nof the first three centuries did not turn on any _calendar_ questions. The\r\nEaster question was merely the symbol of the struggle between what we may\r\ncall the Jewish and Gentile sects of Christians: and it nearly divided the\r\nChristian world, the Easterns, for the most part, being _Quartadecimans_.\r\nIt is very important to note that there is no recorded dispute about a\r\nmethod of predicting the new moon, that is, no general dispute leading to\r\nformation of sects: there may have been difficulties, and discussions about\r\nthem. The Metonic cycle, presently mentioned, must have been used by many,\r\nperhaps most, churches.\r\n\r\n2. The question came before the Nicene Council (A.D. 325) not as an\r\nastronomical, but as a doctrinal, question: it was, in fact, this, Shall\r\nthe _passover_[743] be treated as a part of Christianity? The Council\r\nresolved this question in the negative, and the only information on its\r\npremises and conclusion, or either, which comes from itself, is contained\r\nin the following sentence of the synodical epistle, which epistle is\r\npreserved by Socrates[744] and Theodoret.[745] \"We also send {359} you the\r\ngood news concerning the unanimous consent of all in reference to the\r\ncelebration of the most solemn feast of Easter, for this difference also\r\nhas been made up by the assistance of your prayers: so that all the\r\nbrethren in the East, who formerly celebrated this festival _at the same\r\ntime as the Jews_, will in future conform _to the Romans and to us_, and to\r\nall who have of old observed _our manner_ of celebrating Easter.\" This is\r\nall that can be found on the subject: none of the stories about the Council\r\nordaining the astronomical mode of finding Easter, and introducing the\r\nMetonic cycle into ecclesiastical reckoning, have any contemporary\r\nevidence: the canons which purport to be those of the Nicene Council do not\r\ncontain a word about Easter; and this is evidence, whether we suppose those\r\ncanons to be genuine or spurious.\r\n\r\n3. The astronomical dispute about a lunar cycle for the prediction of\r\nEaster either commenced, or became prominent, by the extinction of greater\r\nones, soon after the time of the Nicene Council. Pope Innocent I[746] met\r\nwith difficulty in 414. S. Leo,[747] in 454, ordained that Easter of 455\r\nshould be April 24; which is right. It is useless to record details of\r\nthese disputes in a summary: the result was, that in the year 463, Pope\r\nHilarius[748] employed Victorinus[749] of Aquitaine to correct the\r\nCalendar, and Victorinus formed a rule which lasted until the sixteenth\r\ncentury. He combined the Metonic cycle and the solar cycle presently\r\ndescribed. But {360} this cycle bears the name of Dionysius Exiguus,[750] a\r\nScythian settled at Rome, about A.D. 530, who adapted it to his new yearly\r\nreckoning, when he abandoned the era of Diocletian as a commencement, and\r\nconstructed that which is now in common use.\r\n\r\n4. With Dionysius, if not before, terminated all difference as to the mode\r\nof keeping Easter which is of historical note: the increasing defects of\r\nthe Easter Cycle produced in time the remonstrance of persons versed in\r\nastronomy, among whom may be mentioned Roger Bacon,[751] Sacrobosco,[752]\r\nCardinal Cusa,[753] Regiomontanus,[754] etc. From the middle of the sixth\r\nto that of the sixteenth century, one rule was observed.\r\n\r\n5. The mode of applying astronomy to chronology has always involved these\r\ntwo principles. First, the actual position of the heavenly body is not the\r\nobject of consideration, but what astronomers call its _mean place_, which\r\nmay be described thus. Let a fictitious sun or moon move in the heavens, in\r\nsuch manner as to revolve among the fixed stars at an average rate,\r\navoiding the alternate accelerations and retardations which take place in\r\nevery planetary motion. Thus the fictitious (say _mean_) sun and moon are\r\nalways very near to the real sun and moon. The ordinary clocks show time by\r\nthe mean, not the real, sun: and it was always laid down that Easter\r\ndepends on the opposition (or full moon) of the mean sun and moon, not of\r\nthe real ones. Thus we see that, were the Calendar ever so correct {361} as\r\nto the _mean_ moon, it would be occasionally false as to the _true_ one:\r\nif, for instance, the opposition of the mean sun and moon took place at one\r\nsecond before midnight, and that of the real bodies only two seconds\r\nafterwards, the calendar day of full moon would be one day before that of\r\nthe common almanacs. Here is a way in which the discussions of 1818 and\r\n1845 might have arisen: the British legislature has defined _the moon_ as\r\nthe regulator of the paschal calendar. But this was only a part of the\r\nmistake.\r\n\r\n6. Secondly, in the absence of perfectly accurate knowledge of the solar\r\nand lunar motion (and for convenience, even if such knowledge existed),\r\ncycles are, and always have been taken, which serve to represent those\r\nmotions nearly. The famous Metonic cycle, which is introduced into\r\necclesiastical chronology under the name of the cycle of the golden\r\nnumbers, is a period of 19 Julian[755] years. This period, in the old\r\nCalendar, was taken to contain exactly 235 _lunations_, or intervals\r\nbetween new moons, of the mean moon. Now the state of the case is:\r\n\r\n19 average Julian years make 6939 days 18 hours.\r\n\r\n235 average lunations make 6939 days 16 hours 31 minutes.\r\n\r\nSo that successive cycles of golden numbers, supposing the first to start\r\nright, amount to making the new moons fall too late, gradually, so that the\r\nmean moon _of this cycle_ gains 1 hour 29 minutes in 19 years upon the mean\r\nmoon of the heavens, or about a day in 300 years. When the Calendar was\r\nreformed, the calendar new moons were four days in advance of the mean moon\r\nof the heavens: so that, for instance, calendar full moon on the 18th\r\nusually meant real full moon on the 14th.\r\n\r\n7. If the difference above had not existed, the moon of the heavens (the\r\nmean moon at least), would have returned {362} permanently to the same days\r\nof the month in 19 years; with an occasional slip arising from the unequal\r\ndistribution of the leap years, of which a period contains sometimes five\r\nand sometimes four. As a general rule, the days of new and full moon in any\r\none year would have been also the days of new and full moon of a year\r\nhaving 19 more units in its date. Again, if there had been no leap years,\r\nthe days of the month would have returned to the same days of the week\r\nevery seven years. The introduction of occasional 29ths of February\r\ndisturbs this, and makes the permanent return of month days to week days\r\noccur only after 28 years. If all had been true, the lapse of 28 times 19,\r\nor 532 years, would have restored the year in every point: that is, A.D. 1,\r\nfor instance, and A.D. 533, would have had the same almanac in every matter\r\nrelating to week days, month days, sun, and moon (mean sun and moon at\r\nleast). And on the supposition of its truth, the old system of Dionysius\r\nwas framed. Its errors, are, first, that the moments of mean new moon\r\nadvance too much by 1 h. 29 m. in 19 average Julian years; secondly, that\r\nthe average Julian year of 3651/4 days is too long by 11 m. 10 s.\r\n\r\n8. The Council of Trent, moved by the representations made on the state of\r\nthe Calendar, referred the consideration of it to the Pope. In 1577,\r\nGregory XIII[756] submitted to the Roman Catholic Princes and Universities\r\na plan presented to him by the representatives of Aloysius Lilius,[757]\r\nthen deceased. This plan being approved of, the Pope nominated a commission\r\nto consider its details, the working member of which was the Jesuit\r\nClavius. A short work was prepared by Clavius, descriptive of the new\r\nCalendar: this {363} was published[758] in 1582, with the Pope's bull\r\n(dated February 24, 1581) prefixed. A larger work was prepared by Clavius,\r\ncontaining fuller explanation, and entitled _Romani Calendarii a Gregorio\r\nXIII. Pontifice Maximo restituti Explicatio_. This was published at Rome in\r\n1603, and again in the collection of the works of Clavius in 1612.\r\n\r\n9. The following extracts from Clavius settle the question of the meaning\r\nof the term _moon_, as used in the Calendar:\r\n\r\n\"Who, except a few who think they are very sharp-sighted in this matter, is\r\nso blind as not to see that the 14th of the moon and the full moon are not\r\nthe same things in the Church of God?... Although the Church, in finding\r\nthe new moon, and from it the 14th day, _uses neither the true nor the mean\r\nmotion of the moon_, but measures only according to the order of a cycle,\r\nit is nevertheless undeniable that the mean full moons found from\r\nastronomical tables are of the greatest use in determining the cycle which\r\nis to be preferred ... the new moons of which cycle, in order to the due\r\ncelebration of Easter, should be so arranged that the 14th days of those\r\nmoons, reckoning from the day of new moon _inclusive_, should not fall two\r\nor more days before the mean full moon, but only one day, or else on the\r\nvery day itself, or not long after. And even thus far the Church need not\r\ntake very great pains ... for it is sufficient that all should reckon by\r\nthe 14th day of the moon in the cycle, even though sometimes it _should be\r\nmore than one day before or after_ the mean full moon.... We have taken\r\npains that in our cycle the new moons should _follow_ the real new moons,\r\nso that the 14th of the moon should fall either the day before the mean\r\nfull moon, or on that day, or not long after; and this was done on purpose,\r\nfor if the new moon of the cycle fell on the same day as the mean new moon\r\nof the {364} astronomers, it might chance that we should celebrate Easter\r\non the same day as the Jews or the Quartadeciman heretics, which would be\r\nabsurd, or else before them, which would be still more absurd.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this it appears that Clavius continued the Calendar of his\r\npredecessors in the choice of the _fourteenth_ day of the moon. Our\r\nlegislature lays down the day of the _full moon_: and this mistake appears\r\nto be rather English than Protestant; for it occurs in missals published in\r\nthe reign of Queen Mary. The calendar lunation being 291/2 days, the middle\r\nday is the _fifteenth_ day, and this is and was reckoned as the day of the\r\nfull moon. There is every right to presume that the original passover was a\r\nfeast of the _real full moon_: but it is most probable that the moons were\r\nthen reckoned, not from the astronomical conjunction with the sun, which\r\nnobody sees except at an eclipse, but from the day of _first visibility_ of\r\nthe new moon. In fine climates this would be the day or two days after\r\nconjunction; and the fourteenth day from that of first visibility\r\ninclusive, would very often be the day of full moon. The following is then\r\nthe proper correction of the precept in the Act of Parliament:\r\n\r\nEaster Day, on which the rest depend, is always the First Sunday after the\r\n_fourteenth day_ of the _calendar_ moon which happens upon or next after\r\nthe Twenty-first day of March, _according to the rules laid down for the\r\nconstruction of the Calendar_; and if the _fourteenth day_ happens upon a\r\nSunday, Easter Day is the Sunday after.\r\n\r\n10. Further, it appears that Clavius valued the celebration of the festival\r\nafter the Jews, etc., more than astronomical correctness. He gives\r\ncomparison tables which would startle a believer in the astronomical\r\nintention of his Calendar: they are to show that a calendar in which the\r\nmoon is always made a day older than by him, _represents the heavens better\r\nthan he has done, or meant to do_. But it must be observed that this\r\ndiminution of the real moon's age has {365} a tendency to make the English\r\nexplanation often practically accordant with the Calendar. For the\r\nfourteenth day of Clavius _is_ generally the fifteenth day of the mean moon\r\nof the heavens, and therefore most often that of the real moon. But for\r\nthis, 1818 and 1845 would not have been the only instances of our day in\r\nwhich the English precept would have contradicted the Calendar.\r\n\r\n11. In the construction of the Calendar, Clavius adopted the ancient cycle\r\nof 532 years, but, we may say, without ever allowing it to run out. At\r\ncertain periods, a shift is made from one part of the cycle into another.\r\nThis is done whenever what should be Julian leap year is made a common\r\nyear, as in 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, etc. It is also done at certain times\r\nto correct the error of 1 h. 19 m., before referred to, in each cycle of\r\ngolden numbers: Clavius, to meet his view of the amount of that error, put\r\nforward the moon's age a day 8 times in 2,500 years. As we cannot enter at\r\nfull length into the explanation, we must content ourselves with giving a\r\nset of rules, independent of tables, by which the reader may find Easter\r\nfor himself in any year, either by the old Calendar or the new. Any one who\r\nhas much occasion to find Easters and movable feasts should procure\r\nFrancoeur's[759] tables.\r\n\r\n12. _Rule for determining Easter Day of the Gregorian Calendar in any year\r\nof the new style._ To the several parts {366} of the rule are annexed, by\r\nway of example, the results for the year 1849.\r\n\r\nI.

The steps are numbered to\r\ncorrespond with the steps of the Gregorian rule, so that it can be seen\r\nwhat augmentations the latter requires.\r\n\r\nI. Set down the given year. (1287).\r\n\r\nII. Take the quotient of the given year divided by 4, neglecting the\r\nremainder (321).\r\n\r\nV. Take 4 more than the sum of I. and II. (1612).\r\n\r\nVI. Find the remainder of V. divided by 7. (2).\r\n\r\nVII. Subtract VI. from 7; this is the number of the dominical letter\r\n\r\n  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  (5; dominical letter E).\r\n  A  B  C  D  E  F  G\r\n\r\nVIII. Divide one more than the given year by 19, the remainder (or 19 if no\r\nremainder) is the golden number. (15).\r\n\r\nXII. Divide 3 less than 11 times VIII. by 30; the remainder (or 30 if there\r\nbe no remainder) is the epact. (12).\r\n\r\n{368}\r\n\r\n_When the Epact is 23, or less._\r\n\r\nXIII. Subtract XII., the epact, from 45. (33).\r\n\r\nXIV. Subtract the epact from 27, divide by 7, and keep the remainder, or 7,\r\nif there be no remainder, (1).\r\n\r\n_When the Epact is greater than 23._\r\n\r\nXIII. Subtract XII., the epact, from 75.\r\n\r\nXIV. Subtract the epact from 57, divide by 7, and keep the remainder, or 7,\r\nif there be no remainder.\r\n\r\nXV. To XIII. add VII., the dominical number, (and 7 besides if XIV. be\r\ngreater than VII.,) and subtract XIV., the result is the day of March, or\r\nif more than 31, subtract 31, and the result is the day of April, on which\r\nEaster Sunday (old style) falls. (37; Easter Day is April 6).\r\n\r\nThese rules completely represent the old and new Calendars, so far as\r\nEaster is concerned. For further explanation we must refer to the articles\r\ncited at the commencement.\r\n\r\nThe annexed is the table of new and full moons of the Gregorian Calendar,\r\ncleared of the errors made for the purpose of preventing Easter from\r\ncoinciding with the Jewish Passover.\r\n\r\nThe second table (page 370) contains _epacts_, or ages of the moon at the\r\nbeginning of the year: thus in 1913, the epact is 22, in 1868 it is 6. This\r\ntable goes from 1850 to 1999: should the New Zealander not have arrived by\r\nthat time, and should the churches of England and Rome then survive, the\r\nepact table may be continued from their liturgy-books. The way of using the\r\ntable is as follows: Take the epact of the required year, and find it in\r\nthe first or last column of the first table, in line with it are seen the\r\ncalendar days of new and full moon. Thus, when the epact is 17, the new and\r\nfull moons of March fall on the 13th and 28th. The result is, for the most\r\npart, correct: but in a minority of cases there is an error of a day. When\r\nthis happens, the error is almost always a fraction of a day much less than\r\ntwelve hours. Thus, when the table gives full moon on the 27th, and the\r\nreal truth is the 28th, we may be sure it is early on the 28th.\r\n\r\n{369}\r\n\r\n

One\r\nconclusion which I arrived at was, that the Nicene Fathers had a knack of\r\nsticking to the question which many later councils could not acquire. In\r\nour own day, it is not permitted to Convocation seriously to discuss any\r\none of the points which are bearing so hard upon their resources of\r\ndefence--the cursing clauses of the Athanasian Creed, for example. And it\r\nmay be collected that the prohibition arises partly from fear that there is\r\nno saying where a beginning, if allowed, would end. There seems to be a\r\nsuspicion that debate, once let loose, would play up old Trent with the\r\nliturgy, and bring the whole book to book. But if any one will examine the\r\nreal Nicene Creed, without the augmentation, he will admire the way in\r\nwhich the framers stuck to the point, and settled what they had to decide,\r\naccording to their view of it. With such a presumption of good sense in\r\ntheir favor, it becomes easier to believe in any claim which may be made on\r\ntheir behalf to tact or sagacity in settling any other matter. And I\r\nstrongly suspect such a claim may be made for them on the Easter question.\r\n\r\nI collect from many little indications, both before and after the Council,\r\nthat the division of the Christian world into Judaical and Gentile, though\r\nnot giving rise to a sectarian distinction expressed by names, was of far\r\ngreater force and meaning than historians prominently admit. I took _note_\r\nof many indications of this, but not _notes_, as it was not to my purpose.\r\nIf it were so, we must admire the discretion of the Council. The Easter\r\nquestion was the {372} fighting ground of the struggle: the Eastern or\r\nJudaical Christians, with some varieties of usage and meaning, would have\r\nthe Passover itself to be the great feast, but taken in a Christian sense;\r\nthe Western or Gentile Christians, would have the commemoration of the\r\nResurrection, connected with the Passover only by chronology. To shift the\r\nPassover in time, under its name, _Pascha_, without allusion to any of the\r\nforce of the change, was gently cutting away the ground from under the feet\r\nof the Conservatives. And it was done in a very quiet way: no allusion to\r\nthe precise character of the change; no hint that the question was about\r\ntwo different festivals: \"all the brethren in the East, who formerly\r\ncelebrated this festival at the same time as the Jews, will in future\r\nconform to the Romans and to us.\" The Judaizers meant to be keeping the\r\nPassover _as_ a Christian feast: they are gently assumed to be keeping,\r\n_not_ the Passover, _but_ a Christian feast; and a doctrinal decision is\r\nquietly, but efficiently, announced under the form of a chronological\r\nordinance. Had the Council issued theses of doctrine, and excommunicated\r\nall dissentients, the rupture of the East and West would have taken place\r\nearlier by centuries than it did. The only place in which I ever saw any\r\npart of my paradox advanced, was in an article in the _Examiner_ newspaper,\r\ntowards the end of 1866, after the above was written.\r\n\r\nA story about Christopher Clavius, the workman of the new Calendar. I\r\nchanced to pick up \"Albertus Pighius Campensis de aequinoctiorum\r\nsolsticiorumque inventione... Ejusdem de ratione Paschalis celebrationis,\r\nDe que Restitutione ecclesiastici Kalendarii,\" Paris, 1520, folio.[760] On\r\nthe title-page were decayed words followed by \".._hristophor.. C..ii_, 1556\r\n(or 8),\" the last blank not entirely erased by time, but showing the lower\r\nhalves of an _l_ and of an _a_, and {373} rather too much room for a _v_.\r\nIt looked very like _E Libris Christophori Clavii_ 1556. By the courtesy of\r\nsome members of the Jesuit body in London, I procured a tracing of the\r\nsignature of Clavius from Rome, and the shapes of the letters, and the\r\nmodes of junction and disjunction, put the matter beyond question. Even the\r\nextra space was explained; he wrote himself Cla_u_ius. Now in 1556, Clavius\r\nwas nineteen years old: it thus appears probable that the framer of the\r\nGregorian Calendar was selected, not merely as a learned astronomer, but as\r\none who had attended to the calendar, and to works on its reformation, from\r\nearly youth. When on the subject I found reason to think that Clavius had\r\nreally read this work, and taken from it a phrase or two and a notion or\r\ntwo. Observe the advantage of writing the baptismal name at full length.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA COUPLE OF MINOR PARADOXES.\r\n\r\n    The discovery of a general resolution of all superior finite equations,\r\n    of every numerical both algebraick and transcendent form. By A. P.\r\n    Vogel,[761] mathematician at Leipzick. Leipzick and London, 1845, 8vo.\r\n\r\nThis work is written in the English of a German who has not mastered the\r\nidiom: but it is always intelligible. It professes to solve equations of\r\nevery degree \"in a more extent sense, and till to every degree of\r\nexactness.\" The general solution of equations of _all_ degrees is a vexed\r\nquestion, which cannot have the mysterious interest of the circle problem,\r\nand is of a comparatively modern date.[762] Mr. Vogel {374} announces a\r\nforthcoming treatise in which are resolved the \"last impossibilities of\r\npure mathematics.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Elective Polarity the Universal Agent. By Frances Barbara Burton,\r\n    authoress of 'Astronomy familiarized,' 'Physical Astronomy,' &c.\r\n    London, 1845, 8vo.[763]\r\n\r\nThe title gives a notion of the theory. The first sentence states, that\r\n12,500 years ago [alpha] Lyrae was the pole-star, and attributes the immense\r\nmagnitude of the now fossil animals to a star of such \"polaric intensity as\r\nVega pouring its magnetic streams through our planet.\" Miss Burton was a\r\nlady of property, and of very respectable acquirements, especially in\r\nHebrew; she was eccentric in all things.\r\n\r\n1867.--Miss Burton is revived by the writer of a book on meteorology which\r\nmakes use of the planets: she is one of his leading minds.[764]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECULATIVE THOUGHT IN ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1845 the old _Mathematical Society_ was merged in the\r\nAstronomical Society. The circle-squarers, etc., thrive more in England\r\nthan in any other country: there are most weeds where there is the largest\r\ncrop. Speculation, though not encouraged by our Government so much as by\r\nthose of the Continent, has had, not indeed such forcing, but much wider\r\ndiffusion: few tanks, but many rivulets. On this point I quote from the\r\npreface to the reprint of the work of Ramchundra,[765] which I\r\nsuperintended for the late Court of Directors of the East India Company.\r\n\r\n{375}\r\n\r\n\"That sound judgment which gives men well to know what is best for them, as\r\nwell as that faculty of invention which leads to development of resources\r\nand to the increase of wealth and comfort, are both materially advanced,\r\nperhaps cannot rapidly be advanced without, a great taste for pure\r\nspeculation among the general mass of the people, down to the lowest of\r\nthose who can read and write. England is a marked example. Many persons\r\nwill be surprised at this assertion. They imagine that our country is the\r\ngreat instance of the refusal of all _unpractical_ knowledge in favor of\r\nwhat is _useful_. I affirm, on the contrary, that there is no country in\r\nEurope in which there has been so wide a diffusion of speculation, theory,\r\nor what other unpractical word the reader pleases. In our country, the\r\nscientific _society_ is always formed and maintained by the people; in\r\nevery other, the scientific _academy_--most aptly named--has been the\r\ncreation of the government, of which it has never ceased to be the\r\nnursling. In all the parts of England in which manufacturing pursuits have\r\ngiven the artisan some command of time, the cultivation of mathematics and\r\nother speculative studies has been, as is well known, a very frequent\r\noccupation. In no other country has the weaver at his loom bent over the\r\n_Principia_ of Newton; in no other country has the man of weekly wages\r\nmaintained his own scientific periodical. With us, since the beginning of\r\nthe last century, scores upon scores--perhaps hundreds, for I am far from\r\nknowing all--of annuals have run, some their ten years, some their\r\nhalf-century, some their century and a half, containing questions to be\r\nanswered, from which many of our examiners in the universities have culled\r\nmaterials for the academical contests. And these questions have always been\r\nanswered, and in cases without number by the lower order of purchasers, the\r\nmechanics, the weavers, and the printers' workmen. I cannot here digress to\r\npoint out the manner in which the concentration of manufactures, and the\r\ngeneral diffusion of education, have affected the {376} state of things; I\r\nspeak of the time during which the present system took its rise, and of the\r\ncircumstances under which many of its most effective promoters were\r\ntrained. In all this there is nothing which stands out, like the\r\nstate-nourished academy, with its few great names and brilliant single\r\nachievements. This country has differed from all others in the wide\r\ndiffusion of the disposition to speculate, which disposition has found its\r\nplace among the ordinary habits of life, moderate in its action, healthy in\r\nits amount.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLD MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nAmong the most remarkable proofs of the diffusion of speculation was the\r\nMathematical Society, which flourished from 1717 to 1845. Its habitat was\r\nSpitalfields, and I think most of its existence was passed in Crispin\r\nStreet. It was originally a plain society, belonging to the studious\r\nartisan. The members met for discussion once a week; and I believe I am\r\ncorrect in saying that each man had his pipe, his pot, and his problem. One\r\nof their old rules was that, \"If any member shall so far forget himself and\r\nthe respect due to the Society as in the warmth of debate to threaten or\r\noffer personal violence to any other member, he shall be liable to\r\nimmediate expulsion, or to pay such fine as the majority of the members\r\npresent shall decide.\" But their great rule, printed large on the back of\r\nthe title page of their last book of regulations, was \"By the constitution\r\nof the Society, it is the duty of every member, if he be asked any\r\nmathematical or philosophical question by another member, to instruct him\r\nin the plainest and easiest manner he is able.\" We shall presently see\r\nthat, in old time, the rule had a more homely form.\r\n\r\nI have been told that De Moivre[766] was a member of this {377} Society.\r\nThis I cannot verify: circumstances render it unlikely; even though the\r\nFrench refugees clustered in Spitalfields; many of them were of the\r\nSociety, which there is some reason to think was founded by them. But\r\nDolland,[767] Thomas Simpson,[768] Saunderson,[769] Crossley,[770] and\r\nothers of known name, were certainly members. The Society gradually\r\ndeclined, and in 1845 was reduced to nineteen members. An arrangement was\r\nmade by which sixteen of these members, who where not already in the\r\nAstronomical Society became Fellows without contribution, all the books and\r\nother property of the old Society being transferred to the new one. I was\r\none of the committee which made the preliminary inquiries, and the reason\r\nof the decline was soon manifest. The only question which could arise was\r\nwhether the members of the society of working men--for this repute still\r\ncontinued--were of that class of educated men who could associate with the\r\nFellows of the Astronomical Society on terms agreeable to all parties. We\r\nfound that the artisan element had been extinct for many years; there was\r\nnot a man but might, as to education, manners, and position, have become a\r\nFellow in the usual way. The fact was that life in Spitalfields had become\r\nharder: and the weaver could {378} only live from hand to mouth, and not up\r\nto the brain. The material of the old Society no longer existed.\r\n\r\nIn 1798, experimental lectures were given, a small charge for admission\r\nbeing taken at the door: by this hangs a tale--and a song. Many years ago,\r\nI found among papers of a deceased friend, who certainly never had anything\r\nto do with the Society, and who passed all his life far from London, a\r\nsong, headed \"Song sung by the Mathematical Society in London, at a dinner\r\ngiven Mr. Fletcher,[771] a solicitor, who had defended the Society gratis.\"\r\nMr. Williams,[772] the Assistant Secretary of the Astronomical Society,\r\nformerly Secretary of the Mathematical Society, remembered that the Society\r\nhad had a solicitor named Fletcher among the members. Some years elapsed\r\nbefore it struck me that my old friend Benjamin Gompertz,[773] who had long\r\nbeen a member, might have some recollection of the matter. The following is\r\nan extract of a letter from him (July 9, 1861):\r\n\r\n\"As to the Mathematical Society, of which I was a member when only 18 years\r\nof age, [Mr. G. was born in 1779], having been, contrary to the rules,\r\nelected under the age of 21. How I came to be a member of that Society--and\r\ncontinued so until it joined the Astronomical Society, and was then the\r\nPresident--was: I happened to pass a bookseller's small shop, of\r\nsecond-hand books, kept by a poor taylor, but a good mathematician, John\r\nGriffiths. I was very pleased to meet a mathematician, and I asked him if\r\nhe would give me some lessons; and his reply was that I was more capable to\r\nteach him, but he belonged to a society of mathematicians, and he would\r\nintroduce me. I accepted the offer, and I was elected, and had many\r\nscholars then to teach, as {379} one of the rules was, if a member asked\r\nfor information, and applied to any one who could give it, he was obliged\r\nto give it, or fine one penny. Though I might say much with respect to the\r\nSociety which would be interesting, I will for the present reply only to\r\nyour question. I well knew Mr. Fletcher, who was a very clever and very\r\nscientific person. He did, as solicitor, defend an action brought by an\r\ninformer against the Society--I think for 5,000l.--for giving lectures to\r\nthe public in philosophical subjects [i.e., for unlicensed public\r\nexhibition with money taken at the doors]. I think the price for admission\r\nwas one shilling, and we used to have, if I rightly recollect, from two to\r\nthree hundred visitors. Mr. Fletcher was successful in his defence, and we\r\ngot out of our trouble. There was a collection made to reward his services,\r\nbut he did not accept of any reward: and I think we gave him a dinner, as\r\nyou state, and enjoyed ourselves; no doubt with astronomical songs and\r\nother songs; but my recollection does not enable me to say if the\r\nastronomical song was a drinking song. I think the anxiety caused by that\r\naction was the cause of some of the members' death. [They had, no doubt,\r\nbroken the law in ignorance; and by the sum named, the informer must have\r\nbeen present, and sued for a penalty on every shilling he could prove to\r\nhave been taken].\"\r\n\r\nI by no means guarantee that the whole song I proceed to give is what was\r\nsung at the dinner: I suspect, by the completeness of the chain, that\r\naugmentations have been made. My deceased friend was just the man to add\r\nsome verses, or the addition may have been made before it came into his\r\nhands, or since his decease, for the scraps containing the verses passed\r\nthrough several hands before they came into mine. We may, however, be\r\npretty sure that the original is substantially contained in what is given,\r\nand that the character is therefore preserved. I have had myself to repair\r\ndamages every now and then, in the way of conjectural restoration of\r\ndefects caused by ill-usage. {380}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ASTRONOMER'S DRINKING SONG.\r\n\r\n \"Whoe'er would search the starry sky,\r\n    Its secrets to divine, sir,\r\n  Should take his glass--I mean, should try\r\n    A glass or two of wine, sir!\r\n  True virtue lies in golden mean,\r\n    And man must wet his clay, sir;\r\n  Join these two maxims, and 'tis seen\r\n    He should drink his bottle a day, sir!\r\n\r\n \"Old Archimedes, reverend sage!\r\n    By trump of fame renowned, sir,\r\n  Deep problems solved in every page,\r\n    And the sphere's curved surface found,[774] sir:\r\n  Himself he would have far outshone,\r\n    And borne a wider sway, sir,\r\n  Had he our modern secret known,\r\n    And drank a bottle a day, sir!\r\n\r\n \"When Ptolemy,[775] now long ago,\r\n    Believed the earth stood still, sir,\r\n  He never would have blundered so,\r\n    Had he but drunk his fill, sir:\r\n  He'd then have felt[776] it circulate,\r\n    And would have learnt to say, sir,\r\n  The true way to investigate\r\n    Is to drink your bottle a day, sir!\r\n\r\n \"Copernicus,[777] that learned wight,\r\n    The glory of his nation,\r\n  With draughts of wine refreshed his sight,\r\n    And saw the earth's rotation;\r\n  {381}\r\n  Each planet then its orb described,\r\n    The moon got under way, sir;\r\n  These truths from nature he imbibed\r\n    For he drank his bottle a day, sir!\r\n\r\n \"The noble[778] Tycho placed the stars,\r\n    Each in its due location;\r\n  He lost his nose[779] by spite of Mars,\r\n    But that was no privation:\r\n  Had he but lost his mouth, I grant\r\n    He would have felt dismay, sir,\r\n  Bless you! _he_ knew what he should want\r\n    To drink his bottle a day, sir!\r\n\r\n \"Cold water makes no lucky hits;\r\n    On mysteries the head runs:\r\n  Small drink let Kepler[780] time his wits\r\n    On the regular polyhedrons:\r\n  He took to wine, and it changed the chime,\r\n    His genius swept away, sir,\r\n  Through area varying[781] as the time\r\n    At the rate of a bottle a day, sir!\r\n\r\n \"Poor Galileo,[782] forced to rat\r\n    Before the Inquisition,\r\n  _E pur si muove_[783] was the pat\r\n    He gave them in addition:\r\n  {382}\r\n  He meant, whate'er you think you prove,\r\n    The earth must go its way, sirs;\r\n  Spite of your teeth I'll make it move,\r\n    For I'll drink my bottle a day, sirs!\r\n\r\n \"Great Newton, who was never beat\r\n    Whatever fools may think, sir;\r\n  Though sometimes he forgot to eat,\r\n    He never forgot to drink, sir:\r\n  Descartes[784] took nought but lemonade,\r\n    To conquer him was play, sir;\r\n  The first advance that Newton made\r\n    Was to drink his bottle a day, sir!\r\n\r\n \"D'Alembert,[785] Euler,[786] and Clairaut,[787]\r\n    Though they increased our store, sir,\r\n  Much further had been seen to go\r\n    Had they tippled a little more, sir!\r\n  Lagrange[788] gets mellow with Laplace,[789]\r\n    And both are wont to say, sir,\r\n  The _philosophe_ who's not an ass\r\n    Will drink his bottle a day, sir!\r\n\r\n \"Astronomers! what can avail\r\n    Those who calumniate us;\r\n  Experiment can never fail\r\n    With such an apparatus:\r\n  Let him who'd have his merits known\r\n    Remember what I say, sir;\r\n  Fair science shines on him alone\r\n    Who drinks his bottle a day, sir!\r\n\r\n  {383}\r\n \"How light we reck of those who mock\r\n    By this we'll make to appear, sir,\r\n  We'll dine by the sidereal[790] clock\r\n    For one more bottle a year, sir:\r\n  But choose which pendulum you will,\r\n    You'll never make your way, sir,\r\n  Unless you drink--and drink your fill,--\r\n    At least a bottle a day, sir!\"\r\n\r\nOld times are changed, old manners gone!\r\n\r\nThere is a new Mathematical Society,[791] and I am, at this present writing\r\n(1866), its first President.

The time may have come when the original documents connected with the\r\ndiscovery of Neptune may be worth revising. The following are extracts from\r\nthe _Athenaeum_ of October 3 and October 17:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLE VERRIER'S[792] PLANET.\r\n\r\nWe have received, at the last moment before making up for press, the\r\nfollowing letter from Sir John Herschel,[793] {384} in reference to the\r\nmatter referred to in the communication from Mr. Hind[794] given below:\r\n\r\n\"Collingwood, Oct. 1.\r\n\r\n\"In my address to the British Association assembled at Southampton, on the\r\noccasion of my resigning the chair to Sir R. Murchison,[795] I stated,\r\namong the remarkable astronomical events of the last twelvemonth, that it\r\nhad added a new planet to our list,--adding, 'it has done more,--it has\r\ngiven us the probable prospect of the discovery of another. We see it as\r\nColumbus saw America from the shores of Spain. Its movements have been\r\nfelt, trembling along the far-reaching line of our analysis, with a\r\ncertainty hardly inferior to that of ocular demonstration.'--These\r\nexpressions are not reported in any of the papers which profess to give an\r\naccount of the proceedings, but I appeal to all present whether they were\r\nnot used.\r\n\r\n\"Give me leave to state my reasons for this confidence; and, in so doing,\r\nto call attention to some facts which deserve to be put on record in the\r\nhistory of this noble discovery. On July 12, 1842, the late illustrious\r\nastronomer, Bessel,[796] honored me with a visit at my present residence.\r\nOn the evening of that day, conversing on the great work of the planetary\r\nreductions undertaken by the Astronomer Royal[797]--then in progress, and\r\nsince published,[798]--M. Bessel remarked that the motions of Uranus, as he\r\nhad satisfied {385} himself by careful examination of the recorded\r\nobservations, could not be accounted for by the perturbations of the known\r\nplanets; and that the deviations far exceeded any possible limits of error\r\nof observation. In reply to the question, Whether the deviations in\r\nquestion might not be due to the action of an unknown planet?--he stated\r\nthat he considered it highly probable that such was the case,--being\r\nsystematic, and such as might be produced by an exterior planet. I then\r\ninquired whether he had attempted, from the indications afforded by these\r\nperturbations, to discover the position of the unknown body,--in order that\r\n'a hue and cry' might be raised for it. From his reply, the words of which\r\nI do not call to mind, I collected that he had not then gone into that\r\ninquiry; but proposed to do so, having now completed certain works which\r\nhad occupied too much of his time. And, accordingly, in a letter which I\r\nreceived from him after his return to Koenigsberg, dated November 14, 1842,\r\nhe says,--'In reference to our conversation at Collingwood, I _announce_ to\r\nyou (_melde_ ich Ihnen) that Uranus is not forgotten.' Doubtless,\r\ntherefore, among his papers will be found some researches on the subject.\r\n\r\n\"The remarkable calculations of M. Le Verrier--which have pointed out, as\r\nnow appears, nearly the true situation of the new planet, by resolving the\r\ninverse problem of the perturbations--if uncorroborated by repetition of\r\nthe numerical calculations by another hand, or by independent investigation\r\nfrom another quarter, would hardly justify so strong an assurance as that\r\nconveyed by my expressions above alluded to. But it was known to me, at\r\nthat time, (I will take the liberty to cite the Astronomer Royal as my\r\nauthority) that a similar investigation had been independently entered\r\ninto, and a conclusion as to the situation of the new planet very nearly\r\ncoincident with M. Le Verrier's arrived at (in entire ignorance of his\r\nconclusions), by a young Cambridge mathematician, Mr. Adams;[799]--who\r\nwill, I hope, {386} pardon this mention of his name (the matter being one\r\nof great historical moment),--and who will, doubtless, in his own good time\r\nand manner, place his calculations before the public.\r\n\r\n\"J.

It is right that I should\r\nfirst say that I have Mr. Adams's permission to make the statements that\r\nfollow, so far as they relate to his labors. I do not propose to enter into\r\na detail of the steps by which Mr. Adams was led, by his spontaneous and\r\nindependent researches, to a conclusion that a planet must exist more\r\ndistant than Uranus. The matter is of too great historical moment not to\r\nreceive a more formal record than it would be proper to give here. My\r\nimmediate object is to show, while the attention of the scientific public\r\nis more particularly directed to the subject, that, with respect to this\r\nremarkable discovery, English astronomers may lay claim to some merit.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Adams formed the resolution of trying, by calculation, to account for\r\nthe anomalies in the motion of Uranus on the hypothesis of a more distant\r\nplanet, when he was an undergraduate in this university, and when his\r\nexertions for the academical distinction, which he obtained in January\r\n1843, left him no time for pursuing the research. In the course of that\r\nyear, he arrived at an approximation to the position of the supposed\r\nplanet; which, however, he did not consider to be worthy of confidence, on\r\naccount of his not {388} having employed a sufficient number of\r\nobservations of Uranus. Accordingly, he requested my intervention to obtain\r\nfor him the early Greenwich observations, then in course of\r\nreduction;--which the Astronomer Royal immediately supplied, in the kindest\r\npossible manner. This was in February, 1844. In September, 1845, Mr. Adams\r\ncommunicated to me values which he had obtained for the heliocentric\r\nlongitude, excentricity of orbit, longitude of perihelion, and mass, of an\r\nassumed exterior planet,--deduced entirely from unaccounted-for\r\nperturbations of Uranus. The same results, somewhat corrected, he\r\ncommunicated, in October, to the Astronomer Royal. M. Le Verrier, in an\r\ninvestigation which was published in June of 1846, assigned very nearly the\r\nsame heliocentric longitude for the probable position of the planet as Mr.\r\nAdams had arrived at, but gave no results respecting its mass and the form\r\nof its orbit. The coincidence as to position from two entirely independent\r\ninvestigations naturally inspired confidence; and the Astronomer Royal\r\nshortly after suggested the employing of the Northumberland telescope of\r\nthis observatory in a systematic search after the hypothetical planet;\r\nrecommending, at the same time, a definite plan of operations. I undertook\r\nto make the search,--and commenced observing on July 29. The observations\r\nwere directed, in the first instance, to the part of the heavens which\r\ntheory had pointed out as the most probable place of the planet; in\r\nselecting which I was guided by a paper drawn up for me by Mr. Adams. Not\r\nhaving hour xxi. of the Berlin star-maps--of the publication of which I was\r\nnot aware--I had to proceed on the principle of comparison of observations\r\nmade at intervals. On July 30, I went over a zone 9' broad, in such a\r\nmanner as to include all stars to the eleventh magnitude. On August 4, I\r\ntook a broader zone and recorded a place of the planet. My next\r\nobservations were on August 12; when I met with a star of the eighth\r\nmagnitude in the zone which I had gone over on July 30,--and which did not\r\nthen {389} contain this star. Of course, this was the planet;--the place of\r\nwhich was, thus, recorded a second time in four days of observing. A\r\ncomparison of the observations of July 30 and August 12 would, according to\r\nthe principle of search which I employed, have shown me the planet. I did\r\nnot make the comparison till after the detection of it at Berlin--partly\r\nbecause I had an impression that a much more extensive search was required\r\nto give any probability of discovery--and partly from the press of other\r\noccupation. The planet, however, was _secured_, and two positions of it\r\nrecorded six weeks earlier here than in any other observatory,--and in a\r\nsystematic search expressly undertaken for that purpose. I give now the\r\npositions of the planet on August 4 and August 12.\r\n\r\n  Greenwich mean time.\r\n\r\n  Aug. 4, 13h. 36m. 25s.     {R.A.   21h. 58m. 14.70s.\r\n                             {N.P.D. 102 deg. 57'  32.2\"\r\n\r\n  Aug. 12, 13h. 3m. 26s.     {R.A.   21h. 57m. 26.13s.\r\n                             {N.P.D. 103 deg.  2'   0.2\"\r\n\r\n\"From these places compared with recent observations Mr. Adams has obtained\r\nthe following results:\r\n\r\n  Distance of the planet from the sun       30.05\r\n  Inclination of the orbit                  1 deg. 45'\r\n  Longitude of the descending node        309 deg. 43'\r\n  Heliocentric longitude, Aug. 4          326 deg. 39'\r\n\r\n\"The present distance from the sun is, therefore, thirty times the earth's\r\nmean distance;--which is somewhat less than the theory had indicated. The\r\nother elements of the orbit cannot be approximated to till the observations\r\nshall have been continued for a longer period.\r\n\r\n\"The part taken by Mr. Adams in the theoretical search after this planet\r\nwill, perhaps, be considered to justify the suggesting of a name. With his\r\nconsent, I mention _Oceanus_ as one which may possibly receive the votes of\r\nastronomers.--I {390} have authority to state that Mr. Adams's\r\ninvestigations will in a short time, be published in detail.\r\n\r\n\"J. CHALLIS.\"[803]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASTRONOMICAL POLICE REPORT.\r\n\r\n\"An ill-looking kind of a body, who declined to give any name, was brought\r\nbefore the Academy of Sciences, charged with having assaulted a gentleman\r\nof the name of Uranus in the public highway. The prosecutor was a youngish\r\nlooking person, wrapped up in two or three great coats; and looked chillier\r\nthan anything imaginable, except the prisoner,--whose teeth absolutely\r\nshook, all the time.\r\n\r\nPoliceman Le Verrier[804] stated that he saw the prosecutor walking along\r\nthe pavement,--and sometimes turning sideways, and sometimes running up to\r\nthe railings and jerking about in a strange way. Calculated that somebody\r\nmust be pulling his coat, or otherwise assaulting him. It was so dark that\r\nhe could not see; but thought, if he watched the direction in which the\r\nnext odd move was made, he might find out something. When the time came, he\r\nset Bruennow, a constable in another division of the same force, to watch\r\nwhere he told him; and Bruennow caught the prisoner lurking about in the\r\nvery spot,--trying to look as if he was minding his own business. Had\r\nsuspected for a long time that somebody was lurking about in the\r\nneighborhood. Bruennow was then called, and deposed to his catching the\r\nprisoner as described.\r\n\r\n_M. Arago._--Was the prosecutor sober?\r\n\r\n_Le Verrier._--Lord, yes, your worship; no man who had a drop in him ever\r\nlooks so cold as he did.\r\n\r\n_M. Arago._--Did you see the assault?\r\n\r\n_Le Verrier._--I can't say I did; but I told Bruennow exactly how he'd be\r\ncrouched down;--just as he was.\r\n\r\n{391}\r\n\r\n_M. Arago (to Bruennow)._--Did _you_ see the assault?\r\n\r\n_Bruennow._--No, your worship; but I caught the prisoner.\r\n\r\n_M. Arago._--How did you know there was any assault at all?\r\n\r\n_Le Verrier._--I reckoned it couldn't be otherwise, when I saw the\r\nprosecutor making those odd turns on the pavement.\r\n\r\n_M. Arago._--You reckon and you calculate! Why, you'll tell me, next, that\r\nyou policemen may sit at home and find out all that's going on in the\r\nstreets by arithmetic. Did you ever bring a case of this kind before me\r\ntill now?\r\n\r\n_Le Verrier._--Why, you see, your worship, the police are growing cleverer\r\nand cleverer every day. We can't help it:--it grows upon us.\r\n\r\n_M. Arago._--You're getting too clever for me. What does the prosecutor\r\nknow about the matter?\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor said, all he knew was that he was pulled behind by somebody\r\nseveral times. On being further examined, he said that he had seen the\r\nprisoner often, but did not know his name, nor how he got his living; but\r\nhad understood he was called Neptune. He himself had paid rates and taxes a\r\ngood many years now. Had a family of six,--two of whom got their own\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner being called on for his defence, said that it was a quarrel.\r\nHe had pushed the prosecutor--and the prosecutor had pushed him. They had\r\nknown each other a long time, and were always quarreling;--he did not know\r\nwhy. It was their nature, he supposed. He further said, that the prosecutor\r\nhad given a false account of himself;--that he went about under different\r\nnames. Sometimes he was called Uranus, sometimes Herschel, and sometimes\r\nGeorgium Sidus; and he had no character for regularity in the neighborhood.\r\nIndeed, he was sometimes not to be seen for a long time at once.\r\n\r\nThe prosecutor, on being asked, admitted, after a little hesitation, that\r\nhe had pushed and pulled the prisoner too. {392} In the altercation which\r\nfollowed, it was found very difficult to make out which began:--and the\r\nworthy magistrate seemed to think they must have begun together.\r\n\r\n_M. Arago._--Prisoner, have you any family?\r\n\r\nThe prisoner declined answering that question at present. He said he\r\nthought the police might as well reckon it out whether he had or not.\r\n\r\n_M. Arago_ said he didn't much differ from that opinion.--He then addressed\r\nboth prosecutor and prisoner; and told them that if they couldn't settle\r\ntheir differences without quarreling in the streets, he should certainly\r\ncommit them both next time. In the meantime, he called upon both to enter\r\ninto their own recognizances; and directed the police to have an eye upon\r\nboth,--observing that the prisoner would be likely to want it a long time,\r\nand the prosecutor would be not a hair the worse for it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis quib was written by a person who was among the astronomers: and it\r\nillustrates the fact that Le Verrier had sole possession of the field until\r\nMr. Challis's letter appeared. Sir John Herschel's previous communication\r\nshould have paved the way: but the wonder of the discovery drove it out of\r\nmany heads. There is an excellent account of the whole matter in Professor\r\nGrant's[805] _History of Physical Astronomy_. The squib scandalized some\r\ngrave people, who wrote severe admonitions to the editor. There are\r\nformalists who spend much time in writing propriety to journals, to which\r\nthey serve as foolometers. In a letter to the _Athenaeum_, speaking of the\r\nway in which people hawk fine terms for common things, I said that these\r\npeople ought to have a new translation of the Bible, which should contain\r\nthe verse \"gentleman and lady, created He them.\" The editor was handsomely\r\nfired and brimstoned!\r\n\r\n{393}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW THEORY OF TIDES.\r\n\r\n    A new theory of the tides: in which the errors of the usual theory are\r\n    demonstrated; and proof shewn that the full moon is not the cause of a\r\n    concomitant spring tide, but actually the cause of the neaps.... By\r\n    Comm^r. Debenham,[806] R.N. London, 1846, 8vo.\r\n\r\nThe author replied to a criticism in the _Athenaeum_, and I remember how, in\r\na very few words, he showed that he had read nothing on the subject. The\r\nreviewer spoke of the forces of the planets (i.e., the Sun and Moon) on the\r\nocean, on which the author remarks, \"But N.B. the Sun is no planet, Mr.\r\nCritic.\" Had he read any of the actual investigations on the usual theory,\r\nhe would have known that to this day the sun and moon continue to be called\r\n_planets_--though the phrase is disappearing--in speaking of the tides; the\r\nsense, of course, being the old one, wandering bodies.\r\n\r\nA large class of the paradoxers, when they meet with something which taken\r\nin their sense is absurd, do not take the trouble to find out the intended\r\nmeaning, but walk off with the words laden with their own first\r\nconstruction. Such men are hardly fit to walk the streets without an\r\ninterpreter. I was startled for a moment, at the time when a recent\r\nhappy--and more recently happier--marriage occupied the public thoughts, by\r\nseeing in a haberdasher's window, in staring large letters, an unpunctuated\r\nsentence which read itself to me as \"Princess Alexandra! collar and cuff!\"\r\nIt immediately occurred to me that had I been any one of some scores of my\r\nparadoxers, I should, no doubt, have proceeded to raise the mob against the\r\nunscrupulous person who dared to hint to a young bride such maleficent--or\r\nat least immellificent--conduct towards her new lord. But, as it was,\r\ncertain material contexts in the shop window suggested a less {394} savage\r\nexplanation. A paradoxer should not stop at reading the advertisements of\r\nNewton or Laplace; he should learn to look at the stock of goods.\r\n\r\nI think I must have an eye for double readings, when presented: though I\r\nnever guess riddles. On the day on which I first walked into the _Panizzi_\r\nreading room[807]--as it ought to be called--at the Museum, I began my\r\ncircuit of the wall-shelves at the ladies' end: and perfectly coincided in\r\nthe propriety of the Bibles and theological works being placed there. But\r\nthe very first book I looked on the back of had, in flaming gold letters,\r\nthe following inscription--\"Blast the Antinomians!\"[808] If a line had been\r\ndrawn below the first word, Dr. Blast's history of the Antinomians would\r\nnot have been so fearfully misinterpreted. It seems that neither the binder\r\nnor the arranger of the room had caught my reading. The book was removed\r\nbefore the catalogue of books of reference was printed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ASTRONOMICAL PARADOXER.\r\n\r\n    Two systems of astronomy: first, the Newtonian system, showing the rise\r\n    and progress thereof, with a short historical account; the general\r\n    theory with a variety of remarks thereon: second, the system in\r\n    accordance with the Holy Scriptures, showing the rise and progress from\r\n    Enoch, the seventh from Adam, the prophets, Moses, and others, in the\r\n    first Testament; our Lord Jesus Christ, and his apostles, in the new or\r\n    second Testament; Reeve and Muggleton, in the third and last Testament;\r\n    with a variety of remarks thereon. By Isaac Frost.[809] London, 1846,\r\n    4to.\r\n\r\n{395}\r\n\r\nA very handsomely printed volume, with beautiful plates. Many readers who\r\nhave heard of Muggletonians have never had any distinct idea of Lodowick\r\nMuggleton,[810] the inspired tailor, (1608-1698) who about 1650 received\r\nhis commission from heaven, wrote a Testament, founded a sect, and\r\ndescended to posterity. Of Reeve[811] less is usually said; according to\r\nMr. Frost, he and Muggleton are the two \"witnesses.\" I shall content myself\r\nwith one specimen of Mr. Frost's science:\r\n\r\n\"I was once invited to hear read over 'Guthrie[812] on Astronomy,' and when\r\nthe reading was concluded I was asked my opinion thereon; when I said,\r\n'Doctor, it appears to me that Sir I. Newton has only given two proofs in\r\nsupport of his theory of the earth revolving round the sun: all the rest is\r\nassertion without any proofs.'--'What are they?' inquired the\r\nDoctor.--'Well,' I said, 'they are, first, the power of {396} attraction to\r\nkeep the earth to the sun; the second is the power of repulsion, by virtue\r\nof the centrifugal motion of the earth: all the rest appears to me\r\nassertion without proof.' The Doctor considered a short time and then said,\r\n'It certainly did appear so.' I said, 'Sir Isaac has certainly obtained the\r\ncredit of completing the system, but really he has only half done his\r\nwork.'--'How is that,' inquired my friend the Doctor. My reply was this:\r\n'You will observe his system shows the earth traverses round the sun on an\r\ninclined plane; the consequence is, there are four powers required to make\r\nhis system complete:\r\n\r\n  1st. The power of _attraction_.\r\n  2ndly. The power of _repulsion_.\r\n  3rdly. The power of _ascending_ the inclined plane.\r\n  4thly. The power of _descending_ the inclined plane.\r\n\r\nYou will thus easily see the _four_ powers required, and Newton has only\r\naccounted for _two_; the work is therefore only half done.' Upon due\r\nreflection the Doctor said, 'It certainly was necessary to have these\r\n_four_ points cleared up before the system could be said to be complete.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that Mr. Frost, and many others on my list, have really\r\nencountered doctors who could be puzzled by such stuff as this, or nearly\r\nas bad, among the votaries of existing systems, and have been encouraged\r\nthereby to print their objections. But justice requires me to say that from\r\nthe words \"power of repulsion by virtue of the centrifugal motion of the\r\nearth,\" Mr. Frost may be suspected of having something more like a notion\r\nof the much-mistaken term \"centrifugal force\" than many paradoxers of\r\ngreater fame. The Muggletonian sect is not altogether friendless: over and\r\nabove this handsome volume, the works of Reeve and Muggleton were printed,\r\nin 1832, in three quarto volumes. See _Notes and Queries, 1st Series_, v,\r\n80; 3d Series, iii, 303. {397}\r\n\r\n[The system laid down by Mr. Frost, though intended to be substantially\r\nthat of Lodowick Muggleton, is not so vagarious. It is worthy of note how\r\nvery different have been the fates of two contemporary paradoxers,\r\nMuggleton and George Fox.[813] They were friends and associates,[814] and\r\ncommenced their careers about the same time, 1647-1650. The followers of\r\nFox have made their sect an institution, and deserve to be called the\r\npioneers of philanthropy. But though there must still be Muggletonians,\r\nsince expensive books are published by men who take the name, no sect of\r\nthat name is known to the world. Nevertheless, Fox and Muggleton are men of\r\none type, developed by the same circumstances: it is for those who\r\ninvestigate such men to point out why their teachings have had fates so\r\ndifferent. Macaulay says it was because Fox found followers of more sense\r\nthan himself. True enough: but why did Fox find such followers and not\r\nMuggleton? The two were equally crazy, to all appearance: and the\r\ndifference required must be sought in the doctrines themselves.\r\n\r\nFox was not a _rational_ man: but the success of his sect and doctrines\r\nentitles him to a letter of alteration of the phrase which I am surprised\r\nhas not become current. When Conduitt,[815] the husband of Newton's\r\nhalf-niece, wrote a circular to Newton's friends, just after his death,\r\ninviting them to bear their parts in a proper biography, he said, \"As Sir\r\nI. Newton was a _national_ man, I think every one ought to contribute to a\r\nwork intended to do him justice.\" Here is the very phrase which is often\r\nwanted to signify that {398} celebrity which puts its mark, good or bad, on\r\nthe national history, in a manner which cannot be asserted of many\r\nnotorious or famous historical characters. Thus George Fox and Newton are\r\nboth _national_ men. Dr. Roget's[816] _Thesaurus_ gives more than fifty\r\nsynonyms--_colleagues_ would be the better word--of \"_celebrated_,\" any one\r\nof which might be applied, either in prose or poetry, to Newton or to his\r\nworks, no one of which comes near to the meaning which Conduitt's adjective\r\nimmediately suggests.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that we are too _monarchical_ to be _national_. We have the\r\nQueen's army, the Queen's navy, the Queen's highway, the Queen's English,\r\netc.; nothing is national except the _debt_. That this remark is not new is\r\nan addition to its force; it has hardly been repeated since it was first\r\nmade. It is some excuse that _nation_ is not vernacular English: the\r\n_country_ is our word, and _country man_ is appropriated.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Astronomical Aphorisms, or Theory of Nature; founded on the immutable\r\n    basis of Meteoric Action.

The success of such writers in\r\nbelieving what they have a bias to believe, would, if they knew themselves,\r\nmake them think it equally likely that the inculpated classes might really\r\nbelieve what it is _their_ interest to believe. The idea of a _guilty_\r\nunderstanding existing among fundholders, or landholders, or any holders,\r\nall the country over, and never detected except by bouncing pamphleteers,\r\nis a theory which should have been left for Cobbett[818] to propose, and\r\nfor Apella to believe.[819]\r\n\r\n[_August_, 1866.

Holyoake.[820] Price _2d._ Is\r\n    there sufficient proof of the existence of God? 8vo. 1847.\r\n\r\nThis acorn of the holy oak was forwarded to me with a manuscript note,\r\nsigned by the editor, on the part of the {400} \"London Society of\r\nTheological Utilitarians,\" who say, \"they trust you may be induced to give\r\nthis momentous subject your consideration.\" The supposition that a\r\nmiddle-aged person, known as a student of thought on more subjects than\r\none, had that particular subject yet to begin, is a specimen of what I will\r\ncall the _assumption-trick_ of controversy, a habit which pervades all\r\nsides of all subjects. The tract is a proof of the good policy of letting\r\nopinions find their level, without any assistance from the Court of Queen's\r\nBench. Twenty years earlier the thesis would have been positive, \"There is\r\nsufficient proof of the non-existence of God,\" and bitter in its tone. As\r\nit stands, we have a moderate and respectful treatment--wrong only in\r\nmaking the opponent argue absurdly, as usually happens when one side\r\ninvents the other--of a question in which a great many Christians have\r\nagreed with the atheist: that question being--Can the existence of God be\r\nproved independently of revelation? Many very religious persons answer this\r\nquestion in the negative, as well as Mr. Holyoake. And, this point being\r\nsettled, all who agree in the negative separate into those who can endure\r\nscepticism, and those who cannot: the second class find their way to\r\nChristianity. This very number of _The Reasoner_ announces the secession of\r\none of its correspondents, and his adoption of the Christian faith. This\r\nwould not have happened twenty years before: nor, had it happened, would it\r\nhave been respectfully announced.\r\n\r\nThere are people who are very unfortunate in the expression of their\r\nmeaning. Mr. Holyoake, in the name of the \"London Society\" etc., forwarded\r\na pamphlet on the existence of God, and said that the Society trusted I\r\n\"may be induced to give\" the subject my \"consideration.\" How could I know\r\nthe Society was one person, who supposed I had arrived at a conclusion and\r\nwanted a \"_guiding word_\"? But so it seems it was: Mr. Holyoake, in the\r\n_English {401} Leader_ of October 15, 1864, and in a private letter to me,\r\nwrites as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The gentleman who was the author of the argument, and who asked me to send\r\nit to Mr. De Morgan, never assumed that that gentleman had 'that particular\r\nsubject to begin'--on the contrary, he supposed that one whom we all knew\r\nto be eminent as a thinker _had_ come to a conclusion upon it, and would\r\nperhaps vouchsafe a guiding word to one who was, as yet, seeking the\r\nsolution of the Great Problem of Theology. I told my friend that 'Mr. De\r\nMorgan was doubtless preoccupied, and that he must be content to wait. On\r\nsome day of courtesy and leisure he might have the kindness to write.' Nor\r\nwas I wrong--the answer appears in your pages at the lapse of seventeen\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\nI suppose Mr. Holyoake's way of putting his request was the _stylus curiae_\r\nof the Society. A worthy Quaker who was sued for debt in the King's Bench\r\nwas horrified to find himself charged in the declaration with detaining his\r\ncreditor's money by force and arms, contrary to the peace of our Lord the\r\nKing, etc. It's only the _stylus curiae_, said a friend: I don't know\r\n_curiae_, said the Quaker, but he shouldn't style us peace-breakers.\r\n\r\nThe notion that the _non_-existence of God can be _proved_, has died out\r\nunder the light of discussion: had the only lights shone from the pulpit\r\nand the prison, so great a step would never have been made. The question\r\nnow is as above. The dictum that Christianity is \"part and parcel of the\r\nlaw of the land\" is also abrogated: at the same time, and the coincidence\r\nis not an accident, it is becoming somewhat nearer the truth that the law\r\nof the land is part and parcel of Christianity. It must also be noticed\r\nthat _Christianity_ was part and parcel of the articles of _war_; and so\r\nwas _duelling_. Any officer speaking against religion was to be cashiered;\r\nand any officer receiving an affront without, in the last resort,\r\nattempting to kill his opponent, was also to be cashiered. Though somewhat\r\nof a book-hunter, I {402} have never been able to ascertain the date of the\r\ncollected remonstrances of the prelates in the House of Lords against this\r\novert inculcation of murder, under the soft name of _satisfaction_: it is\r\nneither in Watt,[821] nor in Lowndes,[822] nor in any edition of\r\nBrunet;[823] and there is no copy in the British Museum. Was the collected\r\nedition really published?\r\n\r\n[The publication of the above in the _Athenaeum_ has not produced reference\r\nto a single copy. The collected edition seems to be doubted. I have even\r\nmet one or two persons who doubt the fact of the Bishops having\r\nremonstrated at all: but their doubt was founded on an absurd supposition,\r\nnamely, that it was _no business of theirs_; that it was not the business\r\nof the prelates of the church in union with the state to remonstrate\r\nagainst the Crown commanding murder! Some say that the edition was\r\npublished, but under an irrelevant title, which prevented people from\r\nknowing what it was about. Such things have happened: for example, arranged\r\nextracts from Wellington's general orders, which would have attracted\r\nattention, fell dead under the title of \"Principles of War.\" It is surmised\r\nthat the book I am looking for also contains the protests of the Reverend\r\nbench against other things besides the Thou-shalt-do-murder of the Articles\r\n(of war), and is called \"First Elements of Religion\" or some similar title.\r\nTime clears up all things.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n\r\n[1] See Mrs. De Morgan's _Memoir of Augustus De Morgan_, London, 1882, p\r\n61.\r\n\r\n[2] In the first edition this reference was to page 11.\r\n\r\n[3] In the first edition this read \"at page 438,\" the work then appearing\r\nin a single volume.\r\n\r\n[4] \"Just as it would surely have been better not to have considered it\r\n(i.e., the trinity) as a mystery, and with Cl. Kleckermann to have\r\ninvestigated by the aid of philosophy according to the teaching of true\r\nlogic what it might be, before they determined what it was; just so would\r\nit have been better to withdraw zealously and industriously into the\r\ndeepest caverns and darkest recesses of metaphysical speculations and\r\nsuppositions in order to establish their opinion beyond danger from the\r\nweapons of their adversaries.... Indeed that great man so explains and\r\ndemonstrates this dogma (although to theologians the word has not much\r\ncharm) from the immovable foundations of philosophy, that with but few\r\nchanges and additions a mind sincerely devoted to truth can desire nothing\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\n[5] Mrs. Wititterly, in _Nicholas Nickleby_.--A. De M.\r\n\r\n[6] The brackets mean that the paragraph is substantially from some one of\r\nthe _Athenaeum Supplements_.--S. E. De M.\r\n\r\n[7] \"It is annoying that this ingenious naturalist who has already given us\r\nmore useful works and has still others in preparation, uses for this odious\r\ntask, a pen dipped in gall and wormwood. It is true that many of his\r\nremarks have some foundation, and that to each error that he points out he\r\nat the same time adds its correction. But he is not always just and never\r\nfails to insult. After all, what does his book prove except that a\r\nforty-fifth part of a very useful review is not free from mistakes? Must we\r\nconfuse him with those superficial writers whose liberty of body does not\r\npermit them to restrain their fruitfulness, that crowd of savants of the\r\nhighest rank whose writings have adorned and still adorn the\r\n_Transactions_? Has he forgotten that the names of the Boyles, Newtons,\r\nHalleys, De Moivres, Hans Sloanes, etc. have been seen frequently? and that\r\nstill are found those of the Wards, Bradleys, Grahams, Ellicots, Watsons,\r\nand of an author whom Mr. Hill prefers to all others, I mean Mr. Hill\r\nhimself?\"\r\n\r\n[8] \"Let no free man be seized or imprisoned or in any way harmed except by\r\ntrial of his peers.\"\r\n\r\n[9] \"The master can rob, wreck and punish his slave according to his\r\npleasure save only that he may not maim him.\"\r\n\r\n[10] An Irish antiquary informs me that Virgil is mentioned in annals at\r\nA.D. 784, as \"Verghil, i.e., the geometer, Abbot of Achadhbo [and Bishop of\r\nSaltzburg] died in Germany in the thirteenth year of his bishoprick.\" No\r\nallusion is made to his opinions; but it seems he was, by tradition, a\r\nmathematician. The Abbot of Aghabo (Queen's County) was canonized by\r\nGregory IX, in 1233. The story of the second, or scapegoat, Virgil would be\r\nmuch damaged by the character given to the real bishop, if there were\r\nanything in it to dilapidate.--A. De M.\r\n\r\n[11] \"He performed many acts befitting the Papal dignity, and likewise many\r\nexcellent (to be sure!) works.\"\r\n\r\n[12] \"After having been on the throne during ten years of pestilence.\"\r\n\r\n[13] The work is the _Questiones Joannis Buridani super X libros\r\nAristotelis ad Nicomachum, curante Egidio Delfo_ ... Parisiis, 1489, folio.\r\nIt also appeared at Paris in editions of 1499, 1513, and 1518, and at\r\nOxford in 1637.\r\n\r\n[14] Jean Buridan was born at Bethune about 1298, and died at Paris about\r\n1358. He was professor of philosophy at the University of Paris and several\r\ntimes held the office of Rector. As a philosopher he was classed among the\r\nnominalists.\r\n\r\n[15] So in the original.\r\n\r\n[16] Baruch Spinoza, or Benedict de Spinoza as he later called himself, the\r\npantheistic philosopher, excommunicated from the Jewish faith for heresy,\r\nwas born at Amsterdam in 1632 and died there in 1677.\r\n\r\n[17] Michael Scott, or Scot, was born about 1190, probably in Fifeshire,\r\nScotland, and died about 1291. He was one of the best known savants of the\r\ncourt of Emperor Frederick II, and wrote upon astrology, alchemy, and the\r\noccult sciences. He was looked upon as a great magician and is mentioned\r\namong the wizards in Dante's _Inferno_.\r\n\r\n             \"That other, round the loins\r\n  So slender of his shape, was Michael Scot,\r\n  Practised in every slight of magic wile.\" _Inferno_, XX.\r\n\r\nBoccaccio also speaks of him: \"It is not long since there was in this city\r\n(Florence) a great master in necromancy, who was called Michele Scotto,\r\nbecause he was a Scot.\" _Decameron_, Dec. Giorno.\r\n\r\nScott's mention of him in Canto Second of his _Lay of the Last Minstrel_,\r\nis well known:\r\n\r\n \"In these fair climes, it was my lot\r\n  To meet the wondrous Michael Scott;\r\n    A wizard of such dreaded fame,\r\n  That when, in Salamanca's cave,\r\n  Him listed his magic wand to wave,\r\n    The bells would ring in Notre Dame!\"\r\n\r\nSir Walter's notes upon him are of interest.\r\n\r\n[18] These were some of the forgeries which Michel Chasles (1793-1880) was\r\nduped into buying. They purported to be a correspondence between Pascal and\r\nNewton and to show that the former had anticipated some of the discoveries\r\nof the great English physicist and mathematician. That they were forgeries\r\nwas shown by Sir David Brewster in 1855.\r\n\r\n[19] \"Let the serpent also break from its appointed path.\"\r\n\r\n[20] Guglielmo Brutus Icilius Timoleon Libri-Carucci della Sommaja, born at\r\nFlorence in 1803; died at Fiesole in 1869. His _Histoire des Sciences\r\nMathematiques_ appeared at Paris in 1838, the entire first edition of\r\nvolume I, save some half dozen that he had carried home, being burned on\r\nthe day that the printing was completed. He was a great collector of early\r\nprinted works on mathematics, and was accused of having stolen large\r\nnumbers of them from other libraries. This accusation took him to London,\r\nwhere he bitterly attacked his accusers. There were two auction sales of\r\nhis library, and a number of his books found their way into De Morgan's\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\n[21] Philo of Gadara lived in the second century B.C. He was a pupil of\r\nSporus, who worked on the problem of the two mean proportionals.\r\n\r\n[22] In his _Histoire des Mathematiques_, the first edition of which\r\nappeared in 1758. Jean Etienne Montucla was born at Lyons in 1725 and died\r\nat Versailles in 1799. He was therefore only thirty-three years old when\r\nhis great work appeared. The second edition, with additions by D'Alembert,\r\nappeared in 1799-1802. He also wrote a work on the quadrature of the\r\ncircle, _Histoire des recherches sur la Quadrature du Cercle_, which\r\nappeared in 1754.\r\n\r\n[23] Eutocius of Ascalon was born in 480 A.D. He wrote commentaries on the\r\nfirst four books of the conics of Apollonius of Perga (247-222 B.C.). He\r\nalso wrote on the Sphere and Cylinder and the Quadrature of the Circle, and\r\non the two books on Equilibrium of Archimedes (287-212 B.C.)\r\n\r\n[24] Edward Cocker was born in 1631 and died between 1671 and 1677. His\r\nfamous arithmetic appeared in 1677 and went through many editions. It was\r\nwritten in a style that appealed to teachers, and was so popular that the\r\nexpression \"According to Cocker\" became a household phrase. Early in the\r\nnineteenth century there was a similar saying in America, \"According to\r\nDaboll,\" whose arithmetic had some points of analogy to that of Cocker.\r\nEach had a well-known prototype in the ancient saying, \"He reckons like\r\nNicomachus of Gerasa.\"\r\n\r\n[25] So in the original, for Barreme. Francois Barreme was to France what\r\nCocker was to England. He was born at Lyons in 1640, and died at Paris in\r\n1703. He published several arithmetics, dedicating them to his patron,\r\nColbert. One of the best known of his works is _L'arithmetique, ou le livre\r\nfacile pour apprendre l'arithmetique soi-meme_, 1677. The French word\r\n_bareme_ or _barreme_, a ready-reckoner, is derived from his name.\r\n\r\n[26] Born at Rome, about 480 A.D.; died at Pavia, 524. Gibbon speaks of him\r\nas \"the last of the Romans whom Cato or Tully could have acknowledged for\r\ntheir countryman.\" His works on arithmetic, music, and geometry were\r\nclassics in the medieval schools.\r\n\r\n[27] Johannes Campanus, of Novarra, was chaplain to Pope Urban IV\r\n(1261-1264). He was one of the early medieval translators of Euclid from\r\nthe Arabic into Latin, and the first printed edition of the _Elements_\r\n(Venice, 1482) was from his translation. In this work he probably depended\r\nnot a little upon at least two or three earlier scholars. He also wrote _De\r\ncomputo ecclesiastico Calendarium_, and _De quadratura circuli_.\r\n\r\n[28] Archimedes gave 3-1/7, and 3-10/71 as the limits of the ratio of the\r\ncircumference to the diameter of a circle.\r\n\r\n[29] Friedrich W. A. Murhard was born at Cassel in 1779 and died there in\r\n1853. His _Bibliotheca Mathematica_, Leipsic, 1797-1805, is ill arranged\r\nand inaccurate, but it is still a helpful bibliography. De Morgan speaks\r\nsomewhere of his indebtedness to it.\r\n\r\n[30] Abraham Gotthelf Kaestner was born at Leipsic in 1719, and died at\r\nGoettingen in 1800. He was professor of mathematics and physics at\r\nGoettingen. His _Geschichte der Mathematik_ (1796-1800) was a work of\r\nconsiderable merit. In the text of the _Budget of Paradoxes_ the name\r\nappears throughout as Kastner instead of Kaestner.\r\n\r\n[31] Lucas Gauricus, or Luca Gaurico, born at Giffoni, near Naples, in\r\n1476; died at Rome in 1558. He was an astrologer and mathematician, and was\r\nprofessor of mathematics at Ferrara in 1531. In 1545 he became bishop of\r\nCivita Ducale.\r\n\r\n[32] John Couch Adams was born at Lidcot, Cornwall, in 1819, and died in\r\n1892. He and Leverrier predicted the discovery of Neptune from the\r\nperturbations in Uranus.\r\n\r\n[33] Urbain-Jean-Joseph Leverrier was born at Saint-Lo, Manche, in 1811,\r\nand died at Paris in 1877. It was his data respecting the perturbations of\r\nUranus that were used by Adams and himself in locating Neptune.\r\n\r\n[34] Joseph-Juste Scaliger, the celebrated philologist, was born at Agen in\r\n1540, and died at Leyden in 1609. His _Cyclometrica elementa_, to which De\r\nMorgan refers, appeared at Leyden in 1594.\r\n\r\n[35] The title is: _In hoc libra contenta.... Introductio i\r\ngeometri[=a].... Liber de quadratura circuli. Liber de cubicatione sphere.\r\nPerspectiva introductio_. Carolus Bovillus, or Charles Bouvelles (Boueelles,\r\nBouilles, Bouvel), was born at Saucourt, Picardy, about 1470, and died at\r\nNoyon about 1533. He was canon and professor of theology at Noyon. His\r\n_Introductio_ contains considerable work on star polygons, a favorite study\r\nin the Middle Ages and early Renaissance. His work _Que hoc volumine\r\ncontin[=e]tur. Liber de intellectu. Liber de sensu_, etc., appeared at\r\nParis in 1509-10.\r\n\r\n[36] Nicolaus Cusanus, Nicolaus Chrypffs or Krebs, was born at Kues on the\r\nMosel in 1401, and died at Todi, Umbria, August 11, 1464. He held positions\r\nof honor in the church, including the bishopric of Brescia. He was made a\r\ncardinal in 1448. He wrote several works on mathematics, his _Opuscula\r\nvaria_ appearing about 1490, probably at Strasburg, but published without\r\ndate or place. His _Opera_ appeared at Paris in 1511 and again in 1514, and\r\nat Basel in 1565.\r\n\r\n[37] Henry Stephens (born at Paris about 1528, died at Lyons in 1598) was\r\none of the most successful printers of his day. He was known as\r\n_Typographus Parisiensis_, and to his press we owe some of the best works\r\nof the period.\r\n\r\n[38] Jacobus Faber Stapulensis (Jacques le Fevre d'Estaples) was born at\r\nEstaples, near Amiens, in 1455, and died at Nerac in 1536. He was a priest,\r\nvicar of the bishop of Meaux, lecturer on philosophy at the College Lemoine\r\nin Paris, and tutor to Charles, son of Francois I. He wrote on philosophy,\r\ntheology, and mathematics.\r\n\r\n[39] Claude-Francois Milliet de Challes was born at Chambery in 1621, and\r\ndied at Turin in 1678. He edited _Euclidis Elementorum libri octo_ in 1660,\r\nand published a _Cursus seu mundus mathematicus_, which included a short\r\nhistory of mathematics, in 1674. He also wrote on mathematical geography.\r\n\r\n[40] This date should be 1503, if he refers to the first edition. It is\r\nwell known that this is the first encyclopedia worthy the name to appear in\r\nprint. It was written by Gregorius Reisch (born at Balingen, and died at\r\nFreiburg in 1487), prior of the cloister at Freiburg and confessor to\r\nMaximilian I. The first edition appeared at Freiburg in 1503, and it passed\r\nthrough many editions in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The title\r\nof the 1504 edition reads: _Aepitoma omnis phylosophiae. alias Margarita\r\nphylosophica tractans de omni genere scibili: Cum additionibus: Quae in\r\nalijs non habentur_.\r\n\r\n[41] This is the _Introductio in arithmeticam Divi S. Boetii.... Epitome\r\nrerum geometricarum ex geometrica introductio C. Bovilli. De quadratura\r\ncirculi demonstratio ex Campano_, that appeared without date about 1507.\r\n\r\n[42] Born at Liverpool in 1805, and died there about 1872. He was a\r\nmerchant, and in 1865 he published, at Liverpool, a work entitled _The\r\nQuadrature of the Circle, or the True Ratio between the Diameter and\r\nCircumference geometrically and mathematically demonstrated_. In this he\r\ngives the ratio as exactly 3-1/8.\r\n\r\n[43] \"That it would be impossible to tell him exactly, since no one had yet\r\nbeen able to find precisely the ratio of the circumference to the\r\ndiameter.\"\r\n\r\n[44] This is the Paris edition: \"Parisiis: ex officina Ascensiana anno\r\nChristi ... MDXIIII,\" as appears by the colophon of the second volume to\r\nwhich De Morgan refers.\r\n\r\n[45] Regiomontanus, or Johann Mueller of Koenigsberg (Regiomontanus), was\r\nborn at Koenigsberg in Franconia, June 5, 1436, and died at Rome July 6,\r\n1476. He studied at Vienna under the great astronomer Peuerbach, and was\r\nhis most famous pupil. He wrote numerous works, chiefly on astronomy. He is\r\nalso known by the names Ioannes de Monte Regio, de Regiomonte, Ioannes\r\nGermanus de Regiomonte, etc.\r\n\r\n[46] Henry Cornelius Agrippa was born at Cologne in 1486 and died either at\r\nLyons in 1534 or at Grenoble in 1535. He was professor of theology at\r\nCologne and also at Turin. After the publication of his _De Occulta\r\nPhilosophia_ he was imprisoned for sorcery. Both works appeared at Antwerp\r\nin 1530, and each passed through a large number of editions. A French\r\ntranslation appeared in Paris in 1582, and an English one in London in\r\n1651.\r\n\r\n[47] Nicolaus Remegius was born in Lorraine in 1554, and died at Nancy in\r\n1600. He was a jurist and historian, and held the office of procurator\r\ngeneral to the Duke of Lorraine.\r\n\r\n[48] This was at the storming of the city by the British on May 4, 1799.\r\nFrom his having been born in India, all this appealed strongly to the\r\ninterests of De Morgan.\r\n\r\n[49] Orontius Finaeus, or Oronce Fine, was born at Briancon in 1494 and\r\ndied at Paris, October 6, 1555. He was imprisoned by Francois I for\r\nrefusing to recognize the concordat (1517). He was made professor of\r\nmathematics in the College Royal (later called the College de France) in\r\n1532. He wrote extensively on astronomy and geometry, but was by no means a\r\ngreat scholar. He was a pretentious man, and his works went through several\r\neditions. His _Protomathesis_ appeared at Paris in 1530-32. The work\r\nreferred to by De Morgan is the _Quadratura circuli tandem inventa &\r\nclarissime demonstrata_ ... Lutetiae Parisiorum, 1544, fol. In the 1556\r\nedition of his _De rebus mathematicis, hactenus desideratis, Libri IIII_,\r\npublished at Paris, the subtitle is: _Quibus inter caetera, Circuli\r\nquadratura Centum modis, & supra, per eundem Orontium recenter excogitatis,\r\ndemonstratus_, so that he kept up his efforts until his death.\r\n\r\n[50] Johannes Buteo (Boteo, Buteon, Bateon) was born in Dauphine c.\r\n1485-1489, and died in a cloister in 1560 or 1564. Some writers give\r\nCharpey as the place and 1492 as the date of his birth, and state that he\r\ndied at Canar in 1572. He belonged to the order of St. Anthony, and wrote\r\nchiefly on geometry, exposing the pretenses of Finaeus. His _Opera\r\ngeometrica_ appeared at Lyons in 1554, and his _Logistica_ and _De\r\nquadratura circuli libri duo_ at Lyons in 1559.\r\n\r\n[51] This is the great French algebraist, Francois Viete (Vieta), who was\r\nborn at Fontenay-le-Comte in 1540, and died at Paris, December 13, 1603.\r\nHis well-known _Isagoge in artem analyticam_ appeared at Tours in 1591. His\r\n_Opera mathematica_ was edited by Van Schooten in 1646.\r\n\r\n[52] This is the _De Rebus mathematicis hactenus desideratis, Libri IIII_,\r\nthat appeared in Paris in 1556. For the title page see Smith, D. E., _Rara\r\nArithmetica_, Boston, 1908, p. 280.\r\n\r\n[53] The title is correct except for a colon after _Astronomicum_. Nicolaus\r\nRaimarus Ursus was born in Henstede or Hattstede, in Dithmarschen, and died\r\nat Prague in 1599 or 1600. He was a pupil of Tycho Brahe. He also wrote _De\r\nastronomis hypothesibus_ (1597) and _Arithmetica analytica vulgo Cosa oder\r\nAlgebra_ (1601).\r\n\r\n[54] Born at Dole, Franche-Comte, about 1550, died in Holland about 1600.\r\nThe work to which reference is made is the _Quadrature du cercle, ou\r\nmaniere de trouver un quarre egal au cercle donne_, which appeared at Delft\r\nin 1584. Duchesne had the courage of his convictions, not only on\r\ncircle-squaring but on religion as well, for he was obliged to leave France\r\nbecause of his conversion to Calvinism. De Morgan's statement that his real\r\nname is Van der Eycke is curious, since he was French born. The Dutch may\r\nhave translated his name when he became professor at Delft, but we might\r\nequally well say, that his real name was Quercetanus or a Quercu.\r\n\r\n[55] This was the father of Adriaan Metius (1571-1635). He was a\r\nmathematician and military engineer, and suggested the ratio 355/113 for\r\n[pi], a ratio afterwards published by his son. The ratio, then new to\r\nEurope, had long been known and used in China, having been found by Tsu\r\nCh'ung-chih (428-499 A.D.).\r\n\r\n[56] This was Jost Buergi, or Justus Byrgius, the Swiss mathematician of\r\nwhom Kepler wrote in 1627: \"Apices logistici Justo Byrgio multis annis ante\r\neditionem Neperianam viam praeiverunt ad hos ipsissimos logarithmos.\" He\r\nconstructed a table of antilogarithms (_Arithmetische und geometrische\r\nProgress-Tabulen_), but it was not published until after Napier's work\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\n[57] Ludolphus Van Ceulen, born at Hildesheim, and died at Leyden in 1610.\r\nIt was he who first carried the computation of [pi] to 35 decimal places.\r\n\r\n[58] Jens Jenssen Dodt, van Flensburg, a Dutch historian, who died in 1847.\r\n\r\n[59] I do not know this edition. There was one \"Antverpiae apud Petrum\r\nBellerum sub scuto Burgundiae,\" 4to, in 1591.\r\n\r\n[60] Archytas of Tarentum (430-365 B.C.) who wrote on proportions,\r\nirrationals, and the duplication of the cube.\r\n\r\n[61]\r\n\r\n      _The Circle Speaks._\r\n \"At first a circle I was called,\r\n  And was a curve around about\r\n  Like lofty orbit of the sun\r\n  Or rainbow arch among the clouds.\r\n  A noble figure then was I--\r\n  And lacking nothing but a start,\r\n  And lacking nothing but an end.\r\n  But now unlovely do I seem\r\n  Polluted by some angles new.\r\n  This thing Archytas hath not done\r\n  Nor noble sire of Icarus\r\n  Nor son of thine, Iapetus.\r\n  What accident or god can then\r\n  Have quadrated mine area?\"\r\n\r\n      _The Author Replies._\r\n \"By deepest mouth of Turia\r\n  And lake of limpid clearness, lies\r\n  A happy state not far removed\r\n  From old Saguntus; farther yet\r\n  A little way from Sucro town.\r\n  In this place doth a poet dwell,\r\n  Who oft the stars will closely scan,\r\n  And always for himself doth claim\r\n  What is denied to wiser men;--\r\n  An old man musing here and there\r\n  And oft forgetful of himself,\r\n  Not knowing how to rightly place\r\n  The compasses, nor draw a line,\r\n  As he doth of himself relate.\r\n  This craftsman fine, in sooth it is\r\n  Hath quadrated thine area.\"\r\n\r\n[62] Pietro Bongo, or Petrus Bungus, was born at Bergamo, and died there in\r\n1601. His work on the Mystery of Numbers is one of the most exhaustive and\r\nerudite ones of the mystic writers. The first edition appeared at Bergamo\r\nin 1583-84; the second, at Bergamo in 1584-85; the third, at Venice in\r\n1585; the fourth, at Bergamo in 1590; and the fifth, which De Morgan calls\r\nthe second, in 1591. Other editions, before the Paris edition to which he\r\nrefers, appeared in 1599 and 1614; and the colophon of the Paris edition is\r\ndated 1617. See the editor's _Rara Arithmetica_, pp. 380-383.\r\n\r\n[63] William Warburton (1698-1779), Bishop of Gloucester, whose works got\r\nhim into numerous literary quarrels, being the subject of frequent satire.\r\n\r\n[64] Thomas Galloway (1796-1851), who was professor of mathematics at\r\nSandhurst for a time, and was later the actuary of the Amicable Life\r\nAssurance Company of London. In the latter capacity he naturally came to be\r\nassociated with De Morgan.\r\n\r\n[65] Giordano Bruno was born near Naples about 1550. He left the Dominican\r\norder to take up Calvinism, and among his publications was _L'expulsion de\r\nla bete triomphante_. He taught philosophy at Paris and Wittenberg, and\r\nsome of his works were published in England in 1583-86. Whether or not he\r\nwas roasted alive \"for the maintenance and defence of the holy Church,\" as\r\nDe Morgan states, depends upon one's religious point of view. At any rate,\r\nhe was roasted as a heretic.\r\n\r\n[66] Referring to part of his _Discours de la methode_, Leyden, 1637.\r\n\r\n[67] Bartholomew Legate, who was born in Essex about 1575. He denied the\r\ndivinity of Christ and was the last heretic burned at Smithfield.\r\n\r\n[68] Edward Wightman, born probably in Staffordshire. He was\r\nanti-Trinitarian, and claimed to be the Messiah. He was the last man burned\r\nfor heresy in England.\r\n\r\n[69] Gaspar Schopp, born at Neumarck in 1576, died at Padua in 1649;\r\ngrammarian, philologist, and satirist.\r\n\r\n[70] Konrad Ritterhusius, born at Brunswick in 1560; died at Altdorf in\r\n1613. He was a jurist of some power.\r\n\r\n[71] Johann Jakob Brucker, born at Augsburg in 1696, died there in 1770. He\r\nwrote on the history of philosophy (1731-36, and 1742-44).\r\n\r\n[72] Daniel Georg Morhof, born at Wismar in 1639, died at Luebeck in 1691.\r\nHe was rector of the University of Kiel, and professor of eloquence,\r\npoetry, and history.\r\n\r\n[73] In the _Histoire des Sciences Mathematiques_, vol. IV, note X, pp.\r\n416-435 of the 1841 edition.\r\n\r\n[74] Colenso (1814-1883), missionary bishop of Natal, was one of the\r\nleaders of his day in the field of higher biblical criticism. De Morgan\r\nmust have admired his mathematical works, which were not without merit.\r\n\r\n[75] Samuel Roffey Maitland, born at London in 1792; died at Gloucester in\r\n1866. He was an excellent linguist and a critical student of the Bible. He\r\nbecame librarian at Lambeth in 1838.\r\n\r\n[76] Archbishop Howley (1766-1848) was a thorough Tory. He was one of the\r\nopponents of the Roman Catholic Relief bill, the Reform bill, and the\r\nJewish Civil Disabilities Relief bill.\r\n\r\n[77] We have, in America at least, almost forgotten the great stir made by\r\nEdward B. Pusey (1800-1882) in the great Oxford movement in the middle of\r\nthe nineteenth century. He was professor of Hebrew at Oxford, and canon of\r\nChrist Church.\r\n\r\n[78] That is, his _Magia universalis naturae et artis sive recondita\r\nnaturalium et artificialium rerum scientia_, Wuerzburg, 1657, 4to, with\r\neditions at Bamberg in 1671, and at Frankfort in 1677. Gaspard Schott\r\n(Koenigshofen 1608, Wuerzburg 1666) was a physicist and mathematician,\r\ndevoting most of his attention to the curiosities of his sciences. His type\r\nof mind must have appealed to De Morgan.\r\n\r\n[79] _Salicetti Quadratura circuli nova, perspicua, expedita, veraque tum\r\nnaturalis, tum geometrica_, etc., 1608.--_Consideratio nova in opusculum\r\nArchimedis de circuli dimensione_, etc., 1609.\r\n\r\n[80] Melchior Adam, who died at Heidelberg in 1622, wrote a collection of\r\nbiographies which was published at Heidelberg and Frankfort from 1615 to\r\n1620.\r\n\r\n[81] Born at Baden in 1524; died at Basel in 1583. The Erastians were\r\nrelated to the Zwinglians, and opposed all power of excommunication and the\r\ninfliction of penalties by a church.\r\n\r\n[82] See Acts xii. 20.\r\n\r\n[83] Theodore de Bese, a French theologian; born at Vezelay, in Burgundy,\r\nin 1519; died at Geneva, in 1605.\r\n\r\n[84] Dr. Robert Lee (1804-1868) had some celebrity in De Morgan's time\r\nthrough his attempt to introduce music and written prayers into the service\r\nof the Scotch Presbyterian church.\r\n\r\n[85] Born at Veringen, Hohenzollern, in 1512; died at Roeteln in 1564.\r\n\r\n[86] Born at Kinnairdie, Bannfshire, in 1661; died at London in 1708. His\r\n_Astronomiae Physicae et Geometriae Elementa_, Oxford, 1702, was an\r\ninfluential work.\r\n\r\n[87] The title was carelessly copied by De Morgan, not an unusual thing in\r\nhis case. The original reads: A Plaine Discovery, of the whole Revelation\r\nof S. Iohn: set downe in two treatises ... set foorth by John Napier L. of\r\nMarchiston ... whereunto are annexed, certaine Oracles of Sibylla ...\r\nLondon ... 1611.\r\n\r\n[88] I have not seen the first edition, but it seems to have appeared in\r\nEdinburgh, in 1593, with a second edition there in 1594. The 1611 edition\r\nwas the third.\r\n\r\n[89] It seems rather certain that Napier felt his theological work of\r\ngreater importance than that in logarithms. He was born at Merchiston, near\r\n(now a part of) Edinburgh, in 1550, and died there in 1617, three years\r\nafter the appearance of his _Mirifici logarithmorum canonis descriptio_.\r\n\r\n[90] Followed, in the third edition, from which he quotes, by a comma.\r\n\r\n[91] There was an edition published at Stettin in 1633. An English\r\ntranslation by P. F. Mottelay appeared at London in 1893. Gilbert\r\n(1540-1603) was physician to Queen Elizabeth and President of the College\r\nof Physicians at London. His _De Magnete_ was the first noteworthy treatise\r\non physics printed in England. He treated of the earth as a spherical\r\nmagnet and suggested the variation and declination of the needle as a means\r\nof finding latitude at sea.\r\n\r\n[92] The title says \"ab authoris fratre collectum,\" although it was edited\r\nby J. Gruterus.\r\n\r\n[93] Porta was born at Naples in 1550 and died there in 1615. He studied\r\nthe subject of lenses and the theory of sight, did some work in hydraulics\r\nand agriculture, and was well known as an astrologer. His _Magiae naturalis\r\nlibri XX_ was published at Naples in 1589. The above title should read\r\n_curvilineorum_.\r\n\r\n[94] Cataldi was born in 1548 and died at Bologna in 1626. He was professor\r\nof mathematics at Perugia, Florence, and Bologna, and is known in\r\nmathematics chiefly for his work in continued fractions. He was one of the\r\nscholarly men of his day.\r\n\r\n[95] Georg Joachim Rheticus was born at Feldkirch in 1514 and died at\r\nCaschau, Hungary, in 1576. He was one of the most prominent pupils of\r\nCopernicus, his _Narratio de libris revolutionum Copernici_ (Dantzig, 1540)\r\nhaving done much to make the theory of his master known.\r\n\r\n[96] Henry Briggs, who did so much to make logarithms known, and who used\r\nthe base 10, was born at Warley Wood, in Yorkshire, in 1560, and died at\r\nOxford in 1630. He was Savilian professor of mathematics at Oxford, and his\r\ngrave may still be seen there.\r\n\r\n[97] He lived at \"Reggio nella Emilia\" in the 16th and 17th centuries. His\r\n_Regola e modo facilissimo di quadrare il cerchio_ was published at Reggio\r\nin 1609.\r\n\r\n[98] Christoph Klau (Clavius) was born at Bamberg in 1537, and died at Rome\r\nin 1612. He was a Jesuit priest and taught mathematics in the Jesuit\r\nCollege at Rome. He wrote a number of works on mathematics, including\r\nexcellent text-books on arithmetic and algebra.\r\n\r\n[99] Christopher Gruenberger, or Grienberger, was born at Halle in Tyrol in\r\n1561, and died at Rome in 1636. He was, like Clavius, a Jesuit and a\r\nmathematician, and he wrote a little upon the subject of projections. His\r\n_Prospectiva nova coelestis_ appeared at Rome in 1612.\r\n\r\n[100] The name should, of course, be Lansbergii in the genitive, and is so\r\nin the original title. Philippus Lansbergius was born at Ghent in 1560, and\r\ndied at Middelburg in 1632. He was a Protestant theologian, and was also a\r\nphysician and astronomer. He was a well-known supporter of Galileo and\r\nCopernicus. His _Commentationes in motum terrae diurnum et annuum_ appeared\r\nat Middelburg in 1630 and did much to help the new theory.\r\n\r\n[101] I have never seen the work. It is rare.\r\n\r\n[102] The African explorer, born in Somersetshire in 1827, died at Bath in\r\n1864. He was the first European to cross Central Africa from north to\r\nsouth. He investigated the sources of the Nile.\r\n\r\n[103] Prester (Presbyter, priest) John, the legendary Christian king whose\r\nrealm, in the Middle Ages, was placed both in Asia and in Africa, is first\r\nmentioned in the chronicles of Otto of Freisingen in the 12th century. In\r\nthe 14th century his kingdom was supposed to be Abyssinia.\r\n\r\n[104] \"It is a profane and barbarous nation, dirty and slovenly, who eat\r\ntheir meat half raw and drink mare's milk, and who use table-cloths and\r\nnapkins only to wipe their hands and mouths.\"\r\n\r\n[105] \"The great Prester John, who is the fourth in rank, is emperor of\r\nEthiopia and of the Abyssinians, and boasts of his descent from the race of\r\nDavid, as having descended from the Queen of Sheba, Queen of Ethiopia. She,\r\nhaving gone to Jerusalem to see the wisdom of Solomon, about the year of\r\nthe world 2952, returned pregnant with a son whom they called Moylech, from\r\nwhom they claim descent in a direct line. And so he glories in being the\r\nmost ancient monarch in the world, saying that his empire has endured for\r\nmore than three thousand years, which no other empire is able to assert. He\r\nalso puts into his titles the following: 'We, the sovereign in my realms,\r\nuniquely beloved of God, pillar of the faith, sprung from the race of\r\nJudah, etc.' The boundaries of this empire touch the Red Sea and the\r\nmountains of Azuma on the east, and on the western side it is bordered by\r\nthe River Nile which separates it from Nubia. To the north lies Egypt, and\r\nto the south the kingdoms of Congo and Mozambique. It extends forty degrees\r\nin length, or one thousand twenty-five leagues, from Congo or Mozambique on\r\nthe south to Egypt on the north; and in width it reaches from the Nile on\r\nthe west to the mountains of Azuma on the east, seven hundred twenty-five\r\nleagues, or twenty-nine degrees. This empire contains thirty large\r\nprovinces, namely Medra, Gaga, Alchy, Cedalon, Mantro, Finazam, Barnaquez,\r\nAmbiam, Fungy, Angote, Cigremaon, Gorga, Cafatez, Zastanla, Zeth, Barly,\r\nBelangana, Tygra, Gorgany, Barganaza, d'Ancut, Dargaly, Ambiacatina,\r\nCaracogly, Amara, Maon (_sic_), Guegiera, Bally, Dobora, and Macheda. All\r\nof these provinces are situated directly under the equinoctial line between\r\nthe tropics of Capricorn and Cancer; but they are two hundred fifty leagues\r\nnearer our tropic than the other. The name of Prester John signifies Great\r\nLord, and is not Priest [Presbyter] as many think. He has always been a\r\nChristian, but often schismatic. At the present time he is a Catholic and\r\nrecognizes the Pope as sovereign pontiff. I met one of his bishops in\r\nJerusalem, and often conversed with him through the medium of our guide. He\r\nwas of grave and serious bearing, pleasant of speech, but wonderfully\r\nsubtle in everything he said. He took great delight in what I had to relate\r\nconcerning our beautiful ceremonies and the dignity of our prelates in\r\ntheir pontifical vestments. As to other matters I will only say that the\r\nEthiopian is joyous and merry, not at all like the Tartar in the matter of\r\nfilth, nor like the wretched Arab. They are refined and subtle, trusting no\r\none, wonderfully suspicious, and very devout. They are not at all black as\r\nis commonly supposed, by which I refer to those who do not live under the\r\nequator or too near to it, for these are Moors as we shall see.\"\r\n\r\nWith respect to this translation it should be said that the original forms\r\nof the proper names have been preserved, although they are not those found\r\nin modern works. It should also be stated that the meaning of Prester is\r\nnot the one that was generally accepted by scholars at the time the work\r\nwas written, nor is it the one accepted to-day. There seems to be no doubt\r\nthat the word is derived from Presbyter as stated in note 103 on page 71,\r\nsince the above-mentioned chronicles of Otto, bishop of Freisingen about\r\nthe middle of the twelfth century, states this fact clearly. Otto received\r\nhis information from the bishop of Gabala (the Syrian Jibal) who told him\r\nthe story of John, _rex et sacerdos_, or Presbyter John as he liked to be\r\ncalled. He goes on to say \"Should it be asked why, with all this power and\r\nsplendor, he calls himself merely 'presbyter,' this is because of his\r\nhumility, and because it was not fitting for one whose server was a primate\r\nand king, whose butler an archbishop and king, whose chamberlain a bishop\r\nand king, whose master of the horse an archimandrite and king, whose chief\r\ncook an abbot and king, to be called by such titles as these.\"\r\n\r\n[106] Thomas Fienus (Fyens) was born at Antwerp in 1567 and died in 1631.\r\nHe was professor of medicine at Louvain. Besides the editions mentioned\r\nbelow, his _De cometis anni 1618_ appeared at Leipsic in 1656. He also\r\nwrote a _Disputatio an coelum moveatur et terra quiescat_, which appeared\r\nat Antwerp in 1619, and again at Leipsic in 1656.\r\n\r\n[107] Libertus Fromondus (1587-c 1653), a Belgian theologian, dean of the\r\nCollege Church at Harcourt, and professor at Louvain. The name also appears\r\nas Froidmont and Froimont.\r\n\r\n[108] _L. Fromondi ... meteorologicorum libri sex.... Cui accessit T. Fieni\r\net L. Fromondi dissertationes de cometa anni 1618...._ This is from the\r\n1670 edition. The 1619 edition was published at Antwerp. The\r\n_Meteorologicorum libri VI_, appeared at Antwerp in 1627. He also wrote\r\n_Anti-Aristarchus sive orbis terrae immobilis liber unicus_ (Antwerp,\r\n1631); _Labyrrinthus sive de compositione continui liber unus, Philosophis,\r\nMathematicis, Theologis utilis et jucundus_ (Antwerp, 1631) and _Vesta sive\r\nAnti-Aristarchi vindex adversus Jac. Lansbergium (Philippi filium) et\r\ncopernicanos_ (Antwerp, 1634).\r\n\r\n[109] Snell was born at Leyden in 1591, and died there in 1626. He studied\r\nunder Tycho Brahe and Kepler, and is known for Snell's law of the\r\nrefraction of light. He was the first to determine the size of the earth by\r\nmeasuring the arc of a meridian with any fair degree of accuracy. The title\r\nshould read: _Willebrordi Snellii R. F. Cyclometricus, de circuli\r\ndimensione secundum Logistarum abacos, et ad Mechanicem accuratissima...._\r\n\r\n[110] Bacon was born at York House, London, in 1561, and died near\r\nHighgate, London, in 1626. His _Novum Organum Scientiarum or New Method of\r\nemploying the reasoning faculties in the pursuits of Truth_ appeared at\r\nLondon in 1620. He had previously published a work entitled _Of the\r\nProficience and Advancement of Learning, divine and humane_ (London, 1605),\r\nwhich again appeared in 1621. His _De augmentis scientiarum Libri IX_\r\nappeared at Paris in 1624, and his _Historia naturalis et experimentalis de\r\nventis_ at Leyden in 1638. He was successively solicitor general, attorney\r\ngeneral, lord chancellor (1619), Baron Verulam and Viscount St. Albans. He\r\nwas deprived of office and was imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1621,\r\nbut was later pardoned.\r\n\r\n[111] The Greek form, _Organon_, is sometimes used.\r\n\r\n[112] James Spedding (1808-1881), fellow of Cambridge, who devoted his life\r\nto his edition of Bacon.\r\n\r\n[113] R. Leslie Ellis (1817-1859), editor of the _Cambridge Mathematical\r\nJournal_. He also wrote on Roman aqueducts, on Boole's Laws of Thought, and\r\non the formation of a Chinese dictionary.\r\n\r\n[114] Douglas Derion Heath (1811-1897), a classical and mathematical\r\nscholar.\r\n\r\n[115] There have been numerous editions of Bacon's complete works,\r\nincluding the following: Frankfort, 1665; London, 1730, 1740, 1764, 1765,\r\n1778, 1803, 1807, 1818, 1819, 1824, 1825-36, 1857-74, 1877. The edition to\r\nwhich De Morgan refers is that of 1857-74, 14 vols., of which five were\r\napparently out at the time he wrote. There were also French editions in\r\n1800 and 1835.\r\n\r\n[116] So in the original for Tycho Brahe.\r\n\r\n[117] In general these men acted before Baron wrote, or at any rate, before\r\nhe wrote the _Novum Organum_, but the statement must not be taken too\r\nliterally. The dates are as follows: Copernicus, 1473-1543; Tycho Brahe,\r\n1546-1601; Gilbert, 1540-1603; Kepler, 1571-1630; Galileo, 1564-1642;\r\nHarvey, 1578-1657. For example, Harvey's _Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu\r\nCordis et Sanguinis_ did not appear until 1628, and his _Exercitationes de\r\nGeneratione_ until 1651.\r\n\r\n[118] Robert Hooke (1635-1703) studied under Robert Boyle at Oxford. He was\r\n\"Curator of Experiments\" to the Royal Society and its secretary, and was\r\nprofessor of geometry at Gresham College, London. It is true that he was\r\n\"very little of a mathematician\" although he wrote on the motion of the\r\nearth (1674), on helioscopes and other instruments (1675), on the rotation\r\nof Jupiter (1666), and on barometers and sails.\r\n\r\n[119] The son of the Sir William mentioned below. He was born in 1792 and\r\ndied in 1871. He wrote a treatise on light (1831) and one on astronomy\r\n(1836), and established an observatory at the Cape of Good Hope where he\r\nmade observations during 1834-1838, publishing them in 1847. On his return\r\nto England he was knighted, and in 1848 was made president of the Royal\r\nSociety. The title of the work to which reference is made is: _A\r\npreliminary discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy_. It appeared at\r\nLondon in 1831.\r\n\r\n[120] Sir William was horn at Hanover in 1738 and died at Slough, near\r\nWindsor in 1822. He discovered the planet Uranus and six satellites,\r\nbesides two satellites of Saturn. He was knighted by George III.\r\n\r\n[121] This was the work of 1836. He also published a work entitled\r\n_Outlines of Astronomy_ in 1849.\r\n\r\n[122] While Newton does not tell the story, he refers in the _Principia_\r\n(1714 edition, p. 293) to the accident caused by his cat.\r\n\r\n[123] Marino Ghetaldi (1566-1627), whose _Promotus Archimedes_ appeared at\r\nRome in 1603, _Nonnullae propositiones de parabola_ at Rome in 1603. and\r\n_Apollonius redivivus_ at Venice in 1607. He was a nobleman and was\r\nambassador from Venice to Rome.\r\n\r\n[124] Simon Stevin (born at Bruges, 1548; died at the Hague, 1620). He was\r\nan engineer and a soldier, and his _La Disme_ (1585) was the first separate\r\ntreatise on the decimal fraction. The contribution referred to above is\r\nprobably that on the center of gravity of three bodies (1586).\r\n\r\n[125] Habakuk Guldin (1577-1643), who took the name Paul on his conversion\r\nto Catholicism. He became a Jesuit, and was professor of mathematics at\r\nVienna and later at Gratz. In his _Centrobaryca seu de centro gravitatis\r\ntrium specierum quantitatis continuae_ (1635), of the edition of 1641,\r\nappears the Pappus rule for the volume of a solid formed by the revolution\r\nof a plane figure about an axis, often spoken of as Guldin's Theorem.\r\n\r\n[126] Edward Wright was born at Graveston, Norfolkshire, in 1560, and died\r\nat London in 1615. He was a fellow of Caius College, Cambridge, and in his\r\nwork entitled _The correction of certain errors in Navigation_ (1599) he\r\ngives the principle of Mercator's projection. He translated the _Portuum\r\ninvestigandorum ratio_ of Stevin in 1599.\r\n\r\n[127] De Morgan never wrote a more suggestive sentence. Its message is not\r\nfor his generation alone.\r\n\r\n[128] The eminent French physicist, Jean Baptiste Biot (1779-1862),\r\nprofessor in the College de France. His work _Sur les observatoires\r\nmeteorologiques_ appeared in 1855.\r\n\r\n[129] George Biddell Airy (1801-1892), professor of astronomy and physics\r\nat Cambridge, and afterwards director of the Observatory at Greenwich.\r\n\r\n[130] De Morgan would have rejoiced in the role played by Intuition in the\r\nmathematics of to-day, notably among the followers of Professor Klein.\r\n\r\n[131] Colburn was the best known of the calculating boys produced in\r\nAmerica. He was born at Cabot, Vermont, in 1804, and died at Norwich,\r\nVermont, in 1840. Having shown remarkable skill in numbers as early as\r\n1810, he was taken to London in 1812, whence he toured through Great\r\nBritain and to Paris. The Earl of Bristol placed him in Westminster School\r\n(1816-1819). On his return to America he became a preacher, and later a\r\nteacher of languages.\r\n\r\n[132] The history of calculating boys is interesting. Mathieu le Coc (about\r\n1664), a boy of Lorraine, could extract cube roots at sight at the age of\r\neight. Tom Fuller, a Virginian slave of the eighteenth century, although\r\nilliterate, gave the number of seconds in 7 years 17 days 12 hours after\r\nonly a minute and a half of thought. Jedediah Buxton, an Englishman of the\r\neighteenth century, was studied by the Royal Society because of his\r\nremarkable powers. Ampere, the physicist, made long calculations with\r\npebbles at the age of four. Gauss, one of the few infant prodigies to\r\nbecome an adult prodigy, corrected his father's payroll at the age of\r\nthree. One of the most remarkable of the French calculating boys was Henri\r\nMondeux. He was investigated by Arago, Sturm, Cauchy, and Liouville, for\r\nthe Academie des Sciences, and a report was written by Cauchy. His\r\nspecialty was the solution of algebraic problems mentally. He seems to have\r\ncalculated squares and cubes by a binomial formula of his own invention. He\r\ndied in obscurity, but was the subject of a _Biographie_ by Jacoby (1846).\r\nGeorge P. Bidder, the Scotch engineer (1806-1878), was exhibited as an\r\narithmetical prodigy at the age of ten, and did not attend school until he\r\nwas twelve. Of the recent cases two deserve special mention, Inaudi and\r\nDiamandi. Jacques Inaudi (born in 1867) was investigated for the Academie\r\nin 1892 by a commission including Poincare, Charcot, and Binet. (See the\r\n_Revue des Deux Mondes_, June 15, 1892, and the laboratory bulletins of the\r\nSorbonne). He has frequently exhibited his remarkable powers in America.\r\nPericles Diamandi was investigated by the same commission in 1893. See\r\nAlfred Binet, _Psychologie des Grands Calculateurs et Joueurs d'Echecs_,\r\nParis, 1894.\r\n\r\n[133] John Flamsteed's (1646-1719) \"old white house\" was the first\r\nGreenwich observatory. He was the Astronomer Royal and first head of this\r\nobservatory.\r\n\r\n[134] It seems a pity that De Morgan should not have lived to lash those of\r\nour time who are demanding only the immediately practical in mathematics.\r\nHis satire would have been worth the reading against those who seek to\r\nstifle the science they pretend to foster.\r\n\r\n[135] Ismael Bouillaud, or Boulliau, was born in 1605 and died at Paris in\r\n1694. He was well known as an astronomer, mathematician, and jurist. He\r\nlived with De Thou at Paris, and accompanied him to Holland. He traveled\r\nextensively, and was versed in the astronomical work of the Persians and\r\nArabs. It was in his _Astronomia philolaica, opus novum_ (Paris, 1645) that\r\nhe attacked Kepler's laws. His tables were shown to be erroneous by the\r\nfact that the solar eclipse did not take place as predicted by him in 1645.\r\n\r\n[136] As it did, until 1892, when Airy had reached the ripe age of\r\nninety-one.\r\n\r\n[137] _Didaci a Stunica ...

For it is not unknown that\r\nLactantius, a writer of prominence in other lines although but little\r\nversed in mathematics, spoke very childishly about the form of the earth\r\nwhen he ridiculed those who declared that it was spherical. Hence it should\r\nnot seem strange to the learned if some shall look upon us in the same way.\r\nMathematics is written for mathematicians, to whom these labors of ours\r\nwill seem, if I mistake not, to add something even to the republic of the\r\nChurch.... _Emend._ Here strike out everything from 'if by chance' to the\r\nwords 'these labors of ours,' and adapt it thus: 'But these labors of\r\nours.'\"\r\n\r\n[144] \"_Copernicus._ However if we consider the matter more carefully it\r\nwill be seen that the investigation is not yet completed, and therefore\r\nought by no means to be condemned. _Emend._ However, if we consider the\r\nmatter more carefully it is of no consequence whether we regard the earth\r\nas existing in the center of the universe or outside of the center, so far\r\nas the solution of the phenomena of celestial movements is concerned.\"\r\n\r\n[145] \"The whole of this chapter may be cut out, since it avowedly treats\r\nof the earth's motion, while it refutes the reasons of the ancients proving\r\nits immobility.

His _Almagestum\r\nnovum_ appeared in 1651, and his _Argomento fisico-matematico contro il\r\nmoto diurno della terra_ in 1668.\r\n\r\n[159] He was a native of Arlington, Sussex, and a pensioner of Christ's\r\nCollege, Cambridge. In 1603 he became a master of arts at Oxford.\r\n\r\n[160] Straying, i.e., from the right way.\r\n\r\n[161] \"Private subjects may, in the presence of danger, defend themselves\r\nor their families against a monarch as against any malefactor, if the\r\nmonarch assaults them like a bandit or a ravisher, and provided they are\r\nunable to summon the usual protection and cannot in any way escape the\r\ndanger.\"\r\n\r\n[162] Daniel Neal (1678-1743), an independent minister, wrote a _History of\r\nthe Puritans_ that appeared in 1732. The account may be found in the New\r\nYork edition of 1843-44, vol. I, p. 271.\r\n\r\n[163] Anthony Wood (1632-1695), whose _Historia et Antiquitates\r\nUniversitatis Oxoniensis_ (1674) and _Athenae Oxoniensis_ (1691) are among\r\nthe classics on Oxford.\r\n\r\n[164] Part of the title, not here quoted, shows the nature of the work more\r\nclearly: \"liber unicus, in quo decretum S. Congregationis S. R. E.\r\nCardinal. an. 1616, adversus Pythagorico-Copernicanos editum defenditur.\"\r\n\r\n[165] This was John Elliot Drinkwater Bethune (1801-1851), the statesman\r\nwho did so much for legislative and educational reform in India. His\r\nfather, John Drinkwater Bethune, wrote a history of the siege of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\n[166] The article referred to is about thirty years old; since it appeared\r\nanother has been given (_Dubl. Rev._, Sept. 1865) which is of much greater\r\ndepth. In it will also be found the Roman view of Bishop Virgil (_ante_, p.\r\n32).--A. De M.\r\n\r\n[167] Jean Baptiste Morin (1583-1656), in his younger days physician to the\r\nBishop of Boulogne and the Duke of Luxemburg, became in 1630 professor of\r\nmathematics at the College Royale. His chief contribution to the problem of\r\nthe determination of longitude is his _Longitudinum terrestrium et\r\ncoelestium nova et hactenus optata scientia_ (1634). He also wrote against\r\nCopernicus in his _Famosi problematis de telluris motu vel quiete hactenus\r\noptata solutio_ (1631), and against Lansberg in his _Responsio pro telluris\r\nquiete_ (1634).\r\n\r\n[168] The work appeared at Leyden in 1626, at Amsterdam in 1634, at\r\nCopenhagen in 1640 and again at Leyden in 1650. The title of the 1640\r\nedition is _Arithmeticae Libri II et Geometriae Libri VI_. The work on\r\nwhich it is based is the _Arithmeticae et Geometriae Practica_, which\r\nappeared in 1611.\r\n\r\n[169] The father's name was Adriaan, and Lalande says that it was Montucla\r\nwho first made the mistake of calling him Peter, thinking that the initials\r\nP. M. stood for Petrus Metius, when in reality they stood for _piae\r\nmemoriae_! The ratio 355/113 was known in China hundreds of years before\r\nhis time. See note 55, page 52.\r\n\r\n[170] Adrian Metius (1571-1635) was professor of medicine at the University\r\nof Franeker. His work was, however, in the domain of astronomy, and in this\r\ndomain he published several treatises.\r\n\r\n[171] The first edition was entitled: _The Discovery of a World in the\r\nMoone. Or, a Discourse Tending to prove that 'tis probable there may be\r\nanother habitable World in that Planet_. 1638, 8vo. The fourth edition\r\nappeared in 1684. John Wilkins (1614-1672) was Warden of Wadham College,\r\nOxford; master of Trinity, Cambridge; and, later, Bishop of Chester. He was\r\ninfluential in founding the Royal Society.\r\n\r\n[172] The first edition was entitled: _C. Hugenii_ [Greek: Kosmotheoros],\r\n_sive de Terris coelestibus, earumque ornatu, conjecturae_, The Hague,\r\n1698, 4to. There were several editions. It was also translated into French\r\n(1718), and there was another English edition (1722). Huyghens (1629-1695)\r\nwas one of the best mathematical physicists of his time.\r\n\r\n[173] It is hardly necessary to say that science has made enormous advance\r\nin the chemistry of the universe since these words were written.\r\n\r\n[174] William Whewell (1794-1866) is best known through his _History of the\r\nInductive Sciences_ (1837) and _Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences_\r\n(1840).\r\n\r\n[175] Thomas Chalmers (1780-1847), the celebrated Scotch preacher. These\r\ndiscourses were delivered while he was minister in a large parish in the\r\npoorest part of Glasgow, and in them he attempted to bring science into\r\nharmony with the Bible. He was afterwards professor of moral philosophy at\r\nSt. Andrew's (1823-28), and professor of theology at Edinburgh (1828). He\r\nbecame the leader of a schism from the Scotch Presbyterian Church,--the\r\nFree Church.\r\n\r\n[176] That is, in Robert Watt's (1774-1819) _Bibliotheca Britannica_\r\n(posthumous, 1824). Nor is it given in the _Dictionary of National\r\nBiography_.\r\n\r\n[177] The late Greek satirist and poet, c. 120-c. 200 A.D.\r\n\r\n[178] Francois Rabelais (c. 1490-1553) the humorist who created Pantagruel\r\n(1533) and Gargantua (1532). His work as a physician and as editor of the\r\nworks of Galen and Hippocrates is less popularly known.\r\n\r\n[179] Francis Godwin (1562-1633) bishop of Llandaff and Hereford. Besides\r\nsome valuable historical works he wrote _The Man in the Moone, or a\r\nDiscourse of a voyage thither by Domingo Gonsales, the Speed Messenger of\r\nLondon_, 1638.\r\n\r\n[180] Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle (1657-1757), historian, critic,\r\nmathematician, Secretary of the Academie des Sciences, and member of the\r\nAcademie Francaise. His _Entretien sur la pluralite des mondes_ appeared at\r\nParis in 1686.\r\n\r\n[181] Athanasius Kircher (1602-1680), Jesuit, professor of mathematics and\r\nphilosophy, and later of Hebrew and Syriac, at Wurzburg; still later\r\nprofessor of mathematics and Hebrew at Rome. He wrote several works on\r\nphysics. His collection of mathematical instruments and other antiquities\r\nbecame the basis of the Kircherian Museum at Rome.\r\n\r\n[182] \"Both belief and non-belief are dangerous. Hippolitus died because\r\nhis stepmother was believed. Troy fell because Cassandra was not believed.\r\nTherefore the truth should be investigated long before foolish opinion can\r\nproperly judge.\" (Prove = probe?).\r\n\r\n[183] Jacobus Grandamicus (Jacques Grandami) was born at Nantes in 1588 and\r\ndied at Paris in 1672. He was professor of theology and philosophy in the\r\nJesuit colleges at Rennes, Tours, Rouen, and other places. He wrote several\r\nworks on astronomy.\r\n\r\n[184] \"And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.\"\r\nJohn xii. 32.\r\n\r\n[185] Andrea Argoli (1568-1657) wrote a number of works on astronomy, and\r\ncomputed ephemerides from 1621 to 1700.\r\n\r\n[186] So in the original edition of the _Budget_. It is Johannem Pellum in\r\nthe original title. John Pell (1610 or 1611-1685) studied at Cambridge and\r\nOxford, and was professor of mathematics at Amsterdam (1643-46) and Breda\r\n(1646-52). He left many manuscripts but published little. His name attaches\r\nby accident to an interesting equation recently studied with care by Dr.\r\nE. E. Whitford (New York, 1912).\r\n\r\n[187] Christianus Longomontanus (Christen Longberg or Lumborg) was born in\r\n1569 at Longberg, Jutland, and died in 1647 at Copenhagen. He was an\r\nassistant of Tycho Brahe and accepted the diurnal while denying the orbital\r\nmotion of the earth. His _Cyclometria e lunulis reciproce demonstrata_\r\nappeared in 1612 under the name of Christen Severin, the latter being his\r\nfamily name. He wrote several other works on the quadrature problem, and\r\nsome treatises on astronomy.\r\n\r\n[188] The names are really pretty well known. Giles Persone de Roberval was\r\nborn at Roberval near Beauvais in 1602, and died at Paris in 1675. He was\r\nprofessor of philosophy at the College Gervais at Paris, and later at the\r\nCollege Royal. He claimed to have discovered the theory of indivisibles\r\nbefore Cavalieri, and his work is set forth in his _Traite des\r\nindivisibles_ which appeared posthumously in 1693.\r\n\r\nHobbes (1588-1679), the political and social philosopher, lived a good part\r\nof his time (1610-41) in France where he was tutor to several young\r\nnoblemen, including the Cavendishes. His _Leviathan_ (1651) is said to have\r\ninfluenced Spinoza, Leibnitz, and Rousseau. His _Quadratura circuli,\r\ncubatio sphaerae, duplicatio cubi ..._ (London, 1669), _Rosetum geometricum\r\n..._ (London, 1671), and _Lux Mathematica, censura doctrinae Wallisianae\r\ncontra Rosetum Hobbesii_ (London, 1674) are entirely forgotten to-day. (See\r\na further note, _infra_.)\r\n\r\nPierre de Carcavi, a native of Lyons, died at Paris in 1684. He was a\r\nmember of parliament, royal librarian, and member of the Academie des\r\nSciences. His attempt to prove the impossibility of the quadrature appeared\r\nin 1645. He was a frequent correspondent of Descartes.\r\n\r\nCavendish (1591-1654) was Sir (not Lord) Charles. He was, like De Morgan\r\nhimself, a bibliophile in the domain of mathematics. His life was one of\r\nstruggle, his term as member of parliament under Charles I being followed\r\nby gallant service in the royal army. After the war he sought refuge on the\r\ncontinent where he met most of the mathematicians of his day. He left a\r\nnumber of manuscripts on mathematics, which his widow promptly disposed of\r\nfor waste paper. If De Morgan's manuscripts had been so treated we should\r\nnot have had his revision of his _Budget of Paradoxes_.\r\n\r\nMarin Mersenne (1588-1648), a minorite, living in the cloisters at Nevers\r\nand Paris, was one of the greatest Franciscan scholars. He edited Euclid,\r\nApollonius, Archimedes, Theodosius, and Menelaus (Paris, 1626), translated\r\nthe Mechanics of Galileo into French (1634), wrote _Harmonicorum Libri XII_\r\n(1636), and _Cogitata physico-mathematica_ (1644), and taught theology and\r\nphilosophy at Nevers.\r\n\r\nJohann Adolph Tasse (Tassius) was born in 1585 and died at Hamburg in 1654.\r\nHe was professor of mathematics in the Gymnasium at Hamburg, and wrote\r\nnumerous works on astronomy, chronology, statics, and elementary\r\nmathematics.\r\n\r\nJohann Ludwig, Baron von Wolzogen, seems to have been one of the early\r\nunitarians, called _Fratres Polonorum_ because they took refuge in Poland.\r\nSome of his works appear in the _Bibliotheca Fratrum Polonorum_ (Amsterdam,\r\n1656). I find no one by the name who was contributing to mathematics at\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\nDescartes is too well known to need mention in this connection.\r\n\r\nBonaventura Cavalieri (1598-1647) was a Jesuit, a pupil of Galileo, and\r\nprofessor of mathematics at Bologna. His greatest work, _Geometria\r\nindivisibilibus continuorum nova quadam ratione promota_, in which he makes\r\na noteworthy step towards the calculus, appeared in 1635.\r\n\r\nJacob (Jacques) Golius was born at the Hague in 1596 and died at Leyden in\r\n1667. His travels in Morocco and Asia Minor (1622-1629) gave him such\r\nknowledge of Arabic that he became professor of that language at Leyden.\r\nAfter Snell's death he became professor of mathematics there. He translated\r\nArabic works on mathematics and astronomy into Latin.\r\n\r\n[189] It would be interesting to follow up these rumors, beginning perhaps\r\nwith the tomb of Archimedes. The Ludolph van Ceulen story is very likely a\r\nmyth. The one about Fagnano may be such. The Bernoulli tomb does have the\r\nspiral, however (such as it is), as any one may see in the cloisters at\r\nBasel to-day.\r\n\r\n[190] Collins (1625-1683) was secretary of the Royal Society, and was \"a\r\nkind of register of all new improvements in mathematics.\" His office\r\nbrought him into correspondence with all of the English scientists, and he\r\nwas influential in the publication of various important works, including\r\nBranker's translation of the algebra by Rhonius, with notes by Pell, which\r\nwas the first work to contain the present English-American symbol of\r\ndivision. He also helped in the publication of editions of Archimedes and\r\nApollonius, of Kersey's Algebra, and of the works of Wallis. His profession\r\nwas that of accountant and civil engineer, and he wrote three unimportant\r\nworks on mathematics (one published posthumously, and the others in 1652\r\nand 1658).\r\n\r\nHeinrich Christian Schumacher (1780-1850) was professor of astronomy at\r\nCopenhagen and director of the observatory at Altona. His translation of\r\nCarnot's _Geometrie de position_ (1807) brought him into personal relations\r\nwith Gauss, and the friendship was helpful to Schumacher. He was a member\r\nof many learned societies and had a large circle of acquaintances. He\r\npublished numerous monographs and works on astronomy.\r\n\r\nGassendi (1592-1655) might well have been included by De Morgan in the\r\ngroup, since he knew and was a friend of most of the important\r\nmathematicians of his day. Like Mersenne, he was a minorite, but he was a\r\nfriend of Galileo and Kepler, and wrote a work under the title _Institutio\r\nastronomica, juxta hypotheses Copernici, Tychonis-Brahaei et Ptolemaei_\r\n(1645). He taught philosophy at Aix, and was later professor of mathematics\r\nat the College Royal at Paris.\r\n\r\nBurnet is the Bishop Gilbert Burnet (1643-1715) who was so strongly\r\nanti-Romanistic that he left England during the reign of James II and\r\njoined the ranks of the Prince of Orange. William made him bishop of\r\nSalisbury.\r\n\r\n[191] There is some substantial basis for De Morgan's doubts as to the\r\nconnection of that _mirandula_ of his age, Sir Kenelm Digby (1603-1665),\r\nwith the famous _poudre de sympathie_. It is true that he was just the one\r\nto prepare such a powder. A dilletante in everything,--learning, war,\r\ndiplomacy, religion, letters, and science--he was the one to exploit a\r\nfraud of this nature. He was an astrologer, an alchemist, and a fabricator\r\nof tales, and well did Henry Stubbes characterize him as \"the very Pliny of\r\nour age for lying.\" He first speaks of the powder in a lecture given at\r\nMontpellier in 1658, and in the same year he published the address at Paris\r\nunder the title: _Discours fait en une celebre assemblee par le chevalier\r\nDigby .... touchant la guerison de playes par la poudre de sympathie_. The\r\nLondon edition referred to by De Morgan also came out in 1658, and several\r\neditions followed it in England, France and Germany. But Nathaniel Highmore\r\nin his _History of Generation_ (1651) referred to the concoction as\r\n\"Talbot's Powder\" some years before Digby took it up. The basis seems to\r\nhave been vitriol, and it was claimed that it would heal a wound by simply\r\nbeing applied to a bandage taken from it.\r\n\r\n[192] This work by Thomas Birch (1705-1766) came out in 1756-57. Birch was\r\na voluminous writer on English history. He was a friend of Dr. Johnson and\r\nof Walpole, and he wrote a life of Robert Boyle.\r\n\r\n[193] We know so much about John Evelyn (1620-1706) through the diary which\r\nhe began at the age of eleven, that we forget his works on navigation and\r\narchitecture.\r\n\r\n[194] I suppose this was the seventh Earl of Shrewsbury (1553-1616).\r\n\r\n[195] This is interesting in view of the modern aseptic practice of surgery\r\nand the antiseptic treatment of wounds inaugurated by the late Lord Lister.\r\n\r\n[196] Perhaps De Morgan had not heard the _bon mot_ of Dr. Holmes: \"I\r\nfirmly believe that if the whole _materia medica_ could be sunk to the\r\nbottom of the sea, it would be all the better for mankind and all the worse\r\nfor the fishes.\"\r\n\r\n[197] The full title is worth giving, because it shows the mathematical\r\ninterests of Hobbes, and the nature of the six dialogues: _Examinatio et\r\nemendatio mathematicae hodiernae qualis explicatur in libris Johannis\r\nWallisii geometriae professoris Saviliani in Academia Oxoniensi: distributa\r\nin sex dialogos (1. De mathematicae origine ...; 2. De principiis traditis\r\nab Euclide; 3. De demonstratione operationum arithmeticarum ...; 4. De\r\nrationibus; 5.

Dimensio circuli tribus methodis demonstrata ... item\r\ncycloidis verae descriptio et proprietates aliquot.)_ Londini, 1660 (not\r\n1666). For a full discussion of the controversy over the circle, see George\r\nCroom Robertson's biography of Hobbes in the eleventh edition of the\r\n_Encyclopaedia Britannica_.\r\n\r\n[198] This is his _Animadversions upon Mr. Hobbes' late book De principiis\r\net ratiocinatione geometrarum_, 1666, or his _Hobbianae quadraturae\r\ncirculi, cubationis sphaerae et duplicationis cubi confutatio_, also of\r\n1669.\r\n\r\n[199] This is the work of 1669 referred to above.\r\n\r\n[200] Gregoire de St. Vincent (1584-1667) published his _Opus geometricum\r\nquadraturae circuli et sectionum coni_ at Antwerp in 1647.\r\n\r\n[201] This appears in _J. Scaligeri cyclometrica elementa duo_, Lugduni\r\nBatav., 1594.\r\n\r\n[202] Adriaen van Roomen (1561-1615) gave the value of [pi] to sixteen\r\ndecimal places in his _Ideae mathematicae pars prima_ (1593), and wrote his\r\n_In Archimedis circuli dimensionem expositio & analysis_ in 1597.\r\n\r\n[203] Kaestner. See note 30 on page 43.\r\n\r\n[204] Bentley (1662-1742) might have done it, for as the head of Trinity\r\nCollege, Cambridge, and a follower of Newton, he knew some mathematics.\r\nErasmus (1466-1536) lived a little too early to attempt it, although his\r\nbrilliant satire might have been used to good advantage against those who\r\ndid try.\r\n\r\n[205] \"In grammar, to give the winds to the ships and to give the ships to\r\nthe winds mean the same thing. But in geometry it is one thing to assume\r\nthe circle BCD not greater than thirty-six segments BCDF, and another (to\r\nassume) the thirty-six segments BCDF not greater than the circle. The one\r\nassumption is true, the other false.\"\r\n\r\n[206] The Greek scholar (1559-1614) who edited a Greek and Latin edition of\r\nAristotle in 1590.\r\n\r\n[207] Jacques Auguste de Thou (1553-1617), the historian and statesman.\r\n\r\n[208] \"To value Scaliger higher even when wrong, than the multitude when\r\nright.\"\r\n\r\n[209] \"I would rather err with Scaliger than be right with Clavius.\"\r\n\r\n[210] \"The perimeter of the dodecagon to be inscribed in a circle is\r\ngreater than the perimeter of the circle. And the more sides a polygon to\r\nbe inscribed in a circle successively has, so much the greater will the\r\nperimeter of the polygon be than the perimeter of the circle.\"\r\n\r\n[211] De Morgan took, perhaps, the more delight in speaking thus of Sir\r\nWilliam Hamilton (1788-1856) because of a spirited controversy that they\r\nhad in 1847 over the theory of logic. Possibly, too, Sir William's low\r\nopinion of mathematics had its influence.\r\n\r\n[212] Edwards (1699-1757) wrote _The canons of criticism_ (1747) in which\r\nhe gave a scathing burlesque on Warburton's Shakespeare. It went through\r\nsix editions.\r\n\r\n[213] Antoine Teissier (born in 1632) published his _Eloges des hommes\r\nsavants, tires de l'histoire de M. de Thou_ in 1683.\r\n\r\n[214] \"He boasted without reason of having found the quadrature of the\r\ncircle. The glory of this admirable discovery was reserved for Joseph\r\nScaliger, as Scevole de St. Marthe has written.\"\r\n\r\n[215] _Natural and political observations mentioned in the following Index,\r\nand made upon the Bills of Mortality.... With reference to the government,\r\nreligion, trade, growth, ayre, and diseases of the said city._ London,\r\n1662, 4to. The book went through several editions.\r\n\r\n[216] _Ne sutor ultra crepidam_, \"Let the cobbler stick to his last,\" as we\r\nnow say.\r\n\r\n[217] The author (1632-1695) of the _Historia et Antiquitates Universitatis\r\nOxoniensis_ (1674). See note 163, page 98.\r\n\r\n[218] The mathematical guild owes Samuel Pepys (1633-1703) for something\r\nbesides his famous diary (1659-1669). Not only was he president of the\r\nRoyal Society (1684), but he was interested in establishing Sir William\r\nBoreman's mathematical school at Greenwich.\r\n\r\n[219] John Graunt (1620-1674) was a draper by trade, and was a member of\r\nthe Common Council of London until he lost office by turning Romanist.\r\nAlthough a shopkeeper, he was elected to the Royal Society on the special\r\nrecommendation of Charles II. Petty edited the fifth edition of his work,\r\nadding much to its size and value, and this may be the basis of Burnet's\r\naccount of the authorship.\r\n\r\n[220] Petty (1623-1687) was a mathematician and economist, and a friend of\r\nPell and Sir Charles Cavendish. His survey of Ireland, made for Cromwell,\r\nwas one of the first to be made on a large scale in a scientific manner. He\r\nwas one of the founders of the Royal Society.\r\n\r\n[221] The story probably arose from Graunt's recent conversion to the Roman\r\nCatholic faith.\r\n\r\n[222] He was born in 1627 and died in 1704. He published a series of\r\nephemerides, beginning in 1659. He was imprisoned in 1679, at the time of\r\nthe \"Popish Plot,\" and again for treason in 1690. His important\r\nastrological works are the _Animal Cornatum, or the Horn'd Beast_ (1654)\r\nand _The Nativity of the late King Charls_ (1659).\r\n\r\n[223] Isaac D'Israeli (1766-1848), in his _Curiosities of Literature_\r\n(1791), speaking of Lilly, says: \"I shall observe of this egregious\r\nastronomer, that there is in this work, so much artless narrative, and at\r\nthe same time so much palpable imposture, that it is difficult to know when\r\nhe is speaking what he really believes to be the truth.\" He goes on to say\r\nthat Lilly relates that \"those adepts whose characters he has drawn were\r\nthe lowest miscreants of the town. Most of them had taken the air in the\r\npillory, and others had conjured themselves up to the gallows. This seems a\r\ntrue statement of facts.\"\r\n\r\n[224] It is difficult to estimate William Lilly (1602-1681) fairly. His\r\n_Merlini Anglici ephemeris_, issued annually from 1642 to 1681, brought him\r\na great deal of money. Sir George Wharton (1617-1681) also published an\r\nalmanac annually from 1641 to 1666. He tried to expose John Booker\r\n(1603-1677) by a work entitled _Mercurio-Coelicio-Mastix; or, an\r\nAnti-caveat to all such, as have (heretofore) had the misfortune to be\r\nCheated and Deluded by that Grand and Traiterous Impostor of this\r\nRebellious Age, John Booker_, 1644. Booker was \"licenser of mathematical\r\n[astrological] publications,\" and as such he had quarrels with Lilly,\r\nWharton, and others.\r\n\r\n[225] See note 171 on page 100.\r\n\r\n[226] This is the _Ars Signorum, vulgo character universalis et lingua\r\nphilosophica_, that appeared at London in 1661, 8vo. George Dalgarno\r\nanticipated modern methods in the teaching of the deaf and dumb.\r\n\r\n[227] See note 200 on page 110.\r\n\r\n[228] If the hyperbola is referred to the asymptotes as axes, the area\r\nbetween two ordinates (x = a, x = b) is the difference of the logarithms of\r\na and b to the base e. E.g., in the case of the hyperbola xy = 1, the area\r\nbetween x = a and x = 1 is log a.\r\n\r\n[229] \"On ne peut lui refuser la justice de remarquer que personne avant\r\nlui ne s'est porte dans cette recherche avec autant de genie, & meme, si\r\nnous en exceptons son objet principal, avec autant de succes.\" _Quadrature\r\ndu Cercle_, p. 66.\r\n\r\n[230] The title proceeds: _Seu duae mediae proportionales inter extremas\r\ndatas per circulum et per infinitas hyperbolas, vel ellipses et per\r\nquamlibet exhibitae_.... Rene Francois, Baron de Sluse (1622-1685) was\r\ncanon and chancellor of Liege, and a member of the Royal Society. He also\r\npublished a work on tangents (1672). The word _mesolabium_ is from the\r\nGreek [Greek: mesolabion] or [Greek: mesolabon], an instrument invented by\r\nEratosthenes for finding two mean proportionals.\r\n\r\n[231] The full title has some interest: _Vera circuli et hyperbolae\r\nquadratura cui accedit geometriae pars universalis inserviens quantitatum\r\ncurvarum transmutationi et mensurae. Authore Jacobo Gregorio Abredonensi\r\nScoto ... Patavii_, 1667. That is, James Gregory (1638-1675) of Aberdeen\r\n(he was really born near but not in the city), a good Scot, was publishing\r\nhis work down in Padua. The reason was that he had been studying in Italy,\r\nand that this was a product of his youth. He had already (1663) published\r\nhis _Optica promota_, and it is not remarkable that his brilliancy brought\r\nhim a wide circle of friends on the continent and the offer of a pension\r\nfrom Louis XIV. He became professor of mathematics at St Andrews and later\r\nat Edinburgh, and invented the first successful reflecting telescope. The\r\ndistinctive feature of his _Vera quadratura_ is his use of an infinite\r\nconverging series, a plan that Archimedes used with the parabola.\r\n\r\n[232] Jean de Beaulieu wrote several works on mathematics, including _La\r\nlumiere de l'arithmetique_ (n.d.), _La lumiere des mathematiques_ (1673),\r\n_Nouvelle invention d'arithmetique_ (1677), and some mathematical tables.\r\n\r\n[233] A just estimate. There were several works published by Gerard\r\nDesargues (1593-1661), of which the greatest was the _Brouillon Proiect_\r\n(Paris, 1639). There is an excellent edition of the _Oeuvres de Desargues_\r\nby M. Poudra, Paris, 1864.\r\n\r\n[234] \"A certain M. de Beaugrand, a mathematician, very badly treated by\r\nDescartes, and, as it appears, rightly so.\"\r\n\r\n[235] This is a very old approximation for [pi]. One of the latest\r\npretended geometric proofs resulting in this value appeared in New York in\r\n1910, entitled _Quadrimetry_ (privately printed).\r\n\r\n[236] \"Copernicus, a German, made himself no less illustrious by his\r\nlearned writings; and we might say of him that he stood alone and unique in\r\nthe strength of his problems, if his excessive presumption had not led him\r\nto set forth in this science a proposition so absurd that it is contrary to\r\nfaith and reason, namely that the circumference of a circle is fixed and\r\nimmovable while the center is movable: on which geometrical principle he\r\nhas declared in his astrological treatise that the sun is fixed and the\r\nearth is in motion.\"\r\n\r\n[237] So in the original.\r\n\r\n[238] Franciscus Maurolycus (1494-1575) was really the best mathematician\r\nproduced by Sicily for a long period. He made Latin translations of\r\nTheodosius, Menelaus, Euclid, Apollonius, and Archimedes, and wrote on\r\ncosmography and other mathematical subjects.\r\n\r\n[239] \"Nicolaus Copernicus is also tolerated who asserted that the sun is\r\nfixed and that the earth whirls about it; and he rather deserves a whip or\r\na lash than a reproof.\"\r\n\r\n[240] \"Algebra is the curious science of scholars, and particularly for a\r\ngeneral of an army, or a captain, in order quickly to draw up an army in\r\nbattle array and to number the musketeers and pikemen who compose it,\r\nwithout the figures of arithmetic. This science has five special figures of\r\nthis kind: P means _plus_ in commerce and _pikemen_ in the army; M means\r\n_minus_, and _musketeer_ in the art of war;... R signifies _root_ in the\r\nmeasurement of a cube, and _rank_ in _the army_; Q means _square_ (French\r\n_quare_, as then spelled) in both cases; C means _cube_ in mensuration, and\r\n_cavalry_ in arranging batallions and squadrons. As for the operations of\r\nthis science, they are as follows: to add a _plus_ and a _plus_, the sum\r\nwill be _plus_; to add _minus_ with _plus_, take the less from the greater\r\nand the remainder will be the sum required or the number to be found. I say\r\nthis only in passing, for the benefit of those who are wholly ignorant of\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n[241] He refers to the _Joannis de Beaugrand ... Geostatice, seu de vario\r\npondere gravium secundum varia a terrae (centro) intervalla dissertatio\r\nmathematica_, Paris, 1636. Pascal relates that de Beaugrand sent all of\r\nRoberval's theorems on the cycloid and Fermat's on maxima and minima to\r\nGalileo in 1638, pretending that they were his own.\r\n\r\n[242] More (1614-1687) was a theologian, a fellow of Christ College,\r\nCambridge, and a Christian Platonist.\r\n\r\n[243] Matthew Hale (1609-1676) the famous jurist, wrote a number of tracts\r\non scientific, moral, and religious subjects. These were collected and\r\npublished in 1805.\r\n\r\n[244] They might have been attributed to many a worse man than Dr. Hales\r\n(1677-1761), who was a member of the Royal Society and of the Paris\r\nAcademy, and whose scheme for the ventilation of prisons reduced the\r\nmortality at the Savoy prison from one hundred to only four a year. The\r\nbook to which reference is made is _Vegetable Staticks or an Account of\r\nsome statical experiments on the sap in Vegetables_, 1727.\r\n\r\n[245] _Pleas of the Crown; or a Methodical Summary of the Principal Matters\r\nrelating to the subject_, 1678.\r\n\r\n[246] _Thomae Streete Astronomia Carolina, a new theory of the celestial\r\nmotions_, 1661. It also appeared at Nuremberg in 1705, and at London in\r\n1710 and 1716 (Halley's editions). He wrote other works on astronomy.\r\n\r\n[247] This was the Sir Thomas Street (1626-1696) who passed sentence of\r\ndeath on a Roman Catholic priest for saying mass. The priest was reprieved\r\nby the king, but in the light of the present day one would think the\r\njustice more in need of pardon. He took part in the trial of the Rye House\r\nConspirators in 1683.\r\n\r\n[248] Edmund Halley (1656-1742), who succeeded Wallis (1703) as Savilian\r\nprofessor of mathematics at Oxford, and Flamsteed (1720) as head of the\r\nGreenwich observatory. It is of interest to note that he was instrumental\r\nin getting Newton's _Principia_ printed.\r\n\r\n[249] Shepherd (born in 1760) was one of the most famous lawyers of his\r\nday. He was knighted in 1814 and became Attorney General in 1817.\r\n\r\n[250] This was William Hone (1780-1842), a book publisher, who wrote\r\nsatires against the government, and who was tried three times because of\r\nhis parodies on the catechism, creed, and litany (illustrated by\r\nCruikshank). He was acquitted on all of the charges.\r\n\r\n[251] Valentinus was a Benedictine monk and was still living at Erfurt in\r\n1413. His _Currus triumphalis antimonii_ appeared in 1624. Synesius was\r\nBishop of Ptolemaide, who died about 430. His works were printed at Paris\r\nin 1605. Theodor Kirckring (1640-1693) was a fellow-student of Spinoza's.\r\nBesides the commentary on Valentine he left several works on anatomy. His\r\ncommentary appeared at Amsterdam in 1671. There were several editions of\r\nthe _Chariot_.\r\n\r\n[252] The chief difficulty with this curious \"monk-bane\" etymology is its\r\nabsurdity. The real origin of the word has given etymologists a good deal\r\nof trouble.\r\n\r\n[253] Robert Boyle (1627-1691), son of \"the Great Earl\" (of Cork). Perhaps\r\nhis best-known discovery is the law concerning the volume of gases.\r\n\r\n[254] The real name of Eirenaeus Philalethes (born in 1622) is unknown. It\r\nmay have been Childe. He claimed to have discovered the philosopher's stone\r\nin 1645. His tract in this work is _The Secret of the Immortal Liquor\r\nAlkahest or Ignis-Aqua_. See note 260, _infra_.\r\n\r\n[255] Johann Baptist van Helmont, Herr von Merode, Royenborg etc.\r\n(1577-1644). His chemical discoveries appeared in his _Ortus medicinae_\r\n(1648), which went through many editions.\r\n\r\n[256] De Morgan should have written up Francis Anthony (1550-1623), whose\r\n_Panacea aurea sive tractatus duo de auro potabili_ (Hamburg, 1619)\r\ndescribed a panacea that he gave for every ill. He was repeatedly\r\nimprisoned for practicing medicine without a license from the Royal College\r\nof Physicians.\r\n\r\n[257] Bernardus Trevisanus (1406-1490), who traveled even through Barbary,\r\nEgypt, Palestine, and Persia in search of the philosopher's stone. He wrote\r\nseveral works on alchemy,--_De Chemica_ (1567), _De Chemico Miraculo_\r\n(1583), _Traite de la nature de l'oeuf des philosophes_ (1659), etc., all\r\npublished long after his death.\r\n\r\n[258] George Ripley (1415-1490) was an Augustinian monk, later a\r\nchamberlain of Innocent VIII, and still later a Carmelite monk. His _Liber\r\nde mercuris philosophico_ and other tracts first appeared in _Opuscula\r\nquaedam chymica_ (Frankfort, 1614).\r\n\r\n[259] Besides the _Opus majus_, and other of the better known works of this\r\ncelebrated Franciscan (1214-1294), there are numerous tracts on alchemy\r\nthat appeared in the _Thesaurus chymicus_ (Frankfort, 1603).\r\n\r\n[260] George Starkey (1606-1665 or 1666) has special interest for American\r\nreaders. He seems to have been born in the Bermudas and to have obtained\r\nthe bachelor's degree in England. He then went to America and in 1646\r\nobtained the master's degree at Harvard, apparently under the name of\r\nStirk. He met Eirenaeus Philalethes (see note 254 above) in America and\r\nlearned alchemy from him. Returning to England, he sold quack medicines\r\nthere, and died in 1666 from the plague after dissecting a patient who had\r\ndied of the disease. Among his works was the _Liquor Alcahest, or a\r\nDiscourse of that Immortal Dissolvent of Paracelsus and Helmont_, which\r\nappeared (1675) some nine years after his death.\r\n\r\n[261] Platt (1552-1611) was the son of a London brewer. Although he left a\r\nmanuscript on alchemy, and wrote a book entitled _Delights for Ladies to\r\nadorne their Persons_ (1607), he was knighted for some serious work on the\r\nchemistry of agriculture, fertilizing, brewing, and the preserving of\r\nfoods, published in _The Jewell House of Art and Nature_ (1594).\r\n\r\n[262] \"Those who wish to call a man a liar and deceiver speak of him a\r\nwriter of almanacs; but those who (would call him) a scoundrel and an\r\nimposter (speak of him as) a chemist.\"\r\n\r\n[263] \"Trust your barque to the winds but not your body to a chemist; any\r\nbreeze is safer than the faith of a chemist.\"\r\n\r\n[264] Probably the Jesuit, Pere Claude Francois Menestrier (1631-1705), a\r\nwell known historian.\r\n\r\n[265] The author was Christopher Nesse (1621-1705), a belligerent\r\nCalvinist, who wrote many controversial works and succeeded in getting\r\nexcommunicated four times. One of his most virulent works was _A Protestant\r\nAntidote against the Poison of Popery_.\r\n\r\n[266] John Case (c. 1660-1700) was a famous astrologer and physician. He\r\nsucceeded to Lilly's practice in London. In a darkened room, wherein he\r\nkept an array of mystical apparatus, he pretended to show the credulous the\r\nghosts of their departed relatives. Besides his astrological works he wrote\r\none serious treatise, the _Compendium Anatomicum nova methodo institutum_\r\n(1695), in which he defends Harvey's theories of embryology.\r\n\r\n[267] Marcelis (1636-after 1714) was a soap maker of Amsterdam. It is to be\r\nhoped that he made better soap than values of [pi].\r\n\r\n[268] John Craig (died in 1731) was a Scotchman, but most of his life was\r\nspent at Cambridge reading and writing on mathematics. He endeavored to\r\nintroduce the Leibnitz differential calculus into England. His mathematical\r\nworks include the _Methodus Figurarum ... Quadraturas determinandi_ (1685),\r\n_Tractatus ... de Figurarum Curvilinearum Quadraturis et locis Geometricis_\r\n(1693), and _De Calculo Fluentium libri duo_ (1718).\r\n\r\n[269] As is well known, this subject owes much to the Bernoullis. Craig's\r\nworks on the calculus brought him into controversy with them. He also wrote\r\non other subjects in which they were interested, as in his memoir _On the\r\nCurve of the quickest descent_ (1700), _On the Solid of least resistance_\r\n(1700), and the _Solution of Bernoulli's problem on Curves_ (1704).\r\n\r\n[270] This is Samuel Lee (1783-1852), the young prodigy in languages. He\r\nwas apprenticed to a carpenter at twelve and learned Greek while working at\r\nthe trade. Before he was twenty-five he knew Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac,\r\nSamaritan, Persian, and Hindustani. He later became Regius professor of\r\nHebrew at Cambridge.\r\n\r\n[271] \"Where the devil, Master Ludovico, did you pick up such a\r\ncollection?\"\r\n\r\n[272] Lord William Brounker (c. 1620-1684), the first president of the\r\nRoyal Society, is best known in mathematics for his contributions to\r\ncontinued fractions.\r\n\r\n[273] Horace Walpole (1717-1797) published his _Catalogue of the Royal and\r\nNoble Authors of England_ in 1758. Since his time a number of worthy names\r\nin the domain of science in general and of mathematics in particular might\r\nbe added from the peerage of England.\r\n\r\n[274] It was written by Charles Hayes (1678-1760), a mathematician and\r\nscholar of no mean attainments. He travelled extensively, and was deputy\r\ngovernor of the Royal African Company. His _Treatise on Fluxions_ (London,\r\n1704) was the first work in English to explain Newton's calculus. He wrote\r\na work entitled _The Moon_ (1723) to prove that our satellite shines by its\r\nown as well as by reflected light. His _Chronographia Asiatica & Aegyptica_\r\n(1758) gives the results of his travels.\r\n\r\n[275] _Publick_ in the original.\r\n\r\n[276] Whiston (1667-1752) succeeded Newton as Lucasian professor of\r\nmathematics at Cambridge. In 1710 he turned Arian and was expelled from the\r\nuniversity. His work on _Primitive Christianity_ appeared the following\r\nyear. He wrote many works on astronomy and religion.\r\n\r\n[277] Ditton (1675-1715) was, on Newton's recommendation, made Head of the\r\nmathematical school at Christ's Hospital, London. He wrote a work on\r\nfluxions (1706). His idea for finding longitude at sea was to place\r\nstations in the Atlantic to fire off bombs at regular intervals, the time\r\nbetween the sound and the flash giving the distance. He also corresponded\r\nwith Huyghens concerning the use of chronometers for the purpose.\r\n\r\n[278] This was John Arbuthnot (c. 1658-1735), the mathematician, physician\r\nand wit. He was intimate with Pope and Swift, and was Royal physician to\r\nQueen Anne. Besides various satires he published a translation of\r\nHuyghens's work on probabilities (1692) and a well-known treatise on\r\nancient coins, weights, and measures (1727).\r\n\r\n[279] Greene (1678-1730) was a very eccentric individual and was generally\r\nridiculed by his contemporaries. In his will he directed that his body be\r\ndissected and his skeleton hung in the library of King's College,\r\nCambridge. Unfortunately for his fame, this wish was never carried out.\r\n\r\n[280] This was the historian, Robert Sanderson (1660-1741), who spent most\r\nof his life at Cambridge.\r\n\r\n[281] I presume this was William Jones (1675-1749) the friend of Newton and\r\nHalley, vice-president of the Royal Society, in whose _Synopsis Palmariorum\r\nMatheseos_ (1706) the symbol [pi] is first used for the circle ratio.\r\n\r\n[282] This was the _Geometrica solidorum, sive materiae, seu de varia\r\ncompositione, progressione, rationeque velocitatum_, Cambridge, 1712. The\r\nwork was parodied in _A Taste of Philosophical Fanaticism ... by a\r\ngentleman of the University of Gratz_.\r\n\r\n[283] The antiquary and scientist (1690-1754), president of the Royal\r\nSociety, member of the Academie, friend of Newton, and authority on\r\nnumismatics.\r\n\r\n[284] She was Catherine Barton, Newton's step-niece. She married John\r\nConduitt, master of the mint, who collected materials for a life of Newton.\r\n\r\n_A propos_ of Mrs. Conduitt's life of her illustrious uncle, Sir George\r\nGreenhill tells a very good story on Poincare, the well-known French\r\nmathematician. At an address given by the latter at the International\r\nCongress of Mathematicians held in Rome in 1908 he spoke of the story of\r\nNewton and the apple as a mere fable. After the address Sir George asked\r\nhim why he had done so, saying that the story was first published by\r\nVoltaire, who had heard it from Newton's niece, Mrs. Conduitt. Poincare\r\nlooked blank and said, \"Newton, et la niece de Newton, et Voltaire,--non!\r\nje ne vous comprends pas!\" He had thought Sir George meant Professor\r\nVolterra of Rome, whose name in French is Voltaire, and who could not\r\npossibly have known a niece of Newton without bridging a century or so.\r\n\r\n[285] This was the Edmund Turnor (1755-1829) who wrote the _Collections for\r\nthe Town and Soke of Grantham, containing authentic Memoirs of Sir Isaac\r\nNewton, from Lord Portsmouth's Manuscripts_, London, 1806.\r\n\r\n[286] It may be recalled to mind that Sir David (1781-1868) wrote a life of\r\nNewton (1855).\r\n\r\n[287] \"They are in the country. We rejoice.\"\r\n\r\n[288] \"I am here, chatterbox, suck!\"\r\n\r\n[289] \"I have been graduated! I decline!\"\r\n\r\n[290] Giovanni Castiglioni (Castillon, Castiglione), was born at\r\nCastiglione, in Tuscany, in 1708, and died at Berlin in 1791. He was\r\nprofessor of mathematics at Utrecht and at Berlin. He wrote on De Moivre's\r\nequations (1762), Cardan's rule (1783), and Euclid's treatment of parallels\r\n(1788-89).\r\n\r\n[291] This was the _Isaaci Newtoni, equitis aurati, opuscula mathematica,\r\nphilosophica et philologica_, Lausannae & Genevae, 1744.\r\n\r\n[292] At London, 4to.\r\n\r\n[293] \"All the English attribute it to Newton.\"\r\n\r\n[294] Stephen Peter Rigaud (1774-1839), Savilian professor of geometry at\r\nOxford (1810-27) and later professor of astronomy and head of the Radcliffe\r\nObservatory. He wrote _An historical Essay on first publication of Sir\r\nIsaac Newton's Principia_, Oxford, 1838, and a two-volume work entitled\r\n_Correspondence of Scientific Men of the 17th Century_, 1841.\r\n\r\n[295] It is no longer considered by scholars as the work of Newton.\r\n\r\n[296] J. Edleston, the author of the _Correspondence of Sir Isaac Newton\r\nand Professor Cotes_, London, 1850.\r\n\r\n[297] Palmer (1601-1647) was Master of Queen's College, Cambridge, a\r\nPuritan but not a separatist. His work, _The Characters of a believing\r\nChristian, in Paradoxes and seeming contradictions_, appeared in 1645.\r\n\r\n[298] Grosart (1827-1899) was a Presbyterian clergyman. He was a great\r\nbibliophile, and issued numerous reprints of rare books.\r\n\r\n[299] This was the year after Palmer's death. The title was, _The Remaines\r\nof ... Francis Lord Verulam....; being Essays and severall Letters to\r\nseverall great personages, and other pieces of various and high concernment\r\nnot heretofore published_, London, 1648, 4to.\r\n\r\n[300] Shaw (1694-1763) was physician extraordinary to George II. He wrote\r\non chemistry and medicine, and his edition of the _Philosophical Works of\r\nFrancis Bacon_ appeared at London in 1733.\r\n\r\n[301] John Locke (1632-1704), the philosopher. This particular work\r\nappeared in 1695. There was an edition in 1834 (vol. 25 of the _Sacred\r\nClassics_) and one in 1836 (vol. 2 of the _Christian Library_).\r\n\r\n[302] I use the word _Socinian_ because it was so much used in Locke's\r\ntime: it is used in our own day by the small fry, the unlearned clergy and\r\ntheir immediate followers, as a term of reproach for _all_ Unitarians. I\r\nsuspect they have a kind of liking for the _word_; it sounds like _so\r\nsinful_. The learned clergy and the higher laity know better: they know\r\nthat the bulk of the modern Unitarians go farther than Socinus, and are not\r\ncorrectly named as his followers. The Unitarians themselves neither desire\r\nnor deserve a name which puts them one point nearer to orthodoxy than they\r\nput themselves. That point is the doctrine that direct prayer to Jesus\r\nChrist is lawful and desirable: this Socinus held, and the modern\r\nUnitarians do not hold. Socinus, in treating the subject in his own\r\n_Institutio_, an imperfect catechism which he left, lays much more stress\r\non John xiv. 13 than on xv. 16 and xvi. 23. He is not disinclined to think\r\nthat _Patrem_ should be in the first citation, where some put it; but he\r\nsays that to ask the Father in the name of the Son is nothing but praying\r\nto the Son in prayer to the Father. He labors the point with obvious wish\r\nto secure a conclusive sanction. In the Racovian Catechism, of which\r\nFaustus Socinus probably drew the first sketch, a clearer light is arrived\r\nat. The translation says: \"But wherein consists the divine honor due to\r\nChrist? In adoration likewise and invocation. For we ought at all times to\r\nadore Christ, and may in our necessities address our prayers to him as\r\noften as we please; and there are many reasons to induce us to do this\r\nfreely.\" There are some who like accuracy, even in aspersion--A. De M.\r\n\r\nSocinus, or Fausto Paolo Sozzini (1539-1604), was an antitrinitarian who\r\nbelieved in prayer and homage to Christ. Leaving Italy after his views\r\nbecame known, he repaired to Basel, but his opinions were too extreme even\r\nfor the Calvinists. He then tried Transylvania, attempting to convert to\r\nhis views the antitrinitarian Bishop David. The only result of his efforts\r\nwas the imprisonment of David and his own flight to Poland, in which\r\ncountry he spent the rest of his life (1579-1604). His complete works\r\nappeared first at Amsterdam in 1668, in the _Bibliotheca Fratres\r\nPolonorum_. The _Racovian Catechism_ (1605) appeared after his death, but\r\nit seems to have been planned by him.\r\n\r\n[303] \"As much of faith as is necessary to salvation is contained in this\r\narticle, Jesus is the Christ.\"\r\n\r\n[304] Edwards (1637-1716) was a Cambridge fellow, strongly Calvinistic. He\r\npublished many theological works, attacking the Arminians and Socinians.\r\nLocke and Whiston were special objects of attack.\r\n\r\n[305] _Sir I. Newton's views on points of Trinitarian Doctrine; his\r\nArticles of Faith, and the General Coincidence of his Opinions with those\r\nof J. Locke; a Selection of Authorities, with Observations_, London, 1856.\r\n\r\n[306] _A Confession of the Faith_, Bristol, 1752, 8vo.\r\n\r\n[307] This was really very strange, because Laud (1573-1644), while he was\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, forced a good deal of High Church ritual on the\r\nPuritan clergy, and even wished to compel the use of a prayer book in\r\nScotland. It was this intolerance that led to his impeachment and\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\n[308] The name is Jonchere. He was a man of some merit, proposing (1718) an\r\nimportant canal in Burgundy, and publishing a work on the _Decouverte des\r\nlongitudes estimees generalement impossible a trouver_, 1734 (or 1735).\r\n\r\n[309] Locke invented a kind of an instrument for finding longitude, and it\r\nis described in the appendix, but I can find nothing about the man. There\r\nwas published some years later (London, 1751) another work of his, _A new\r\nProblem to discover the longitude at sea_.\r\n\r\n[310] Baxter, concerning whom I know merely that he was a schoolmaster,\r\nstarts with the assumption of this value, and deduces from it some fourteen\r\nproperties relating to the circle.\r\n\r\n[311] John, who died in 1780, was a well-known character in his way. He was\r\na bookseller on Fleet Street, and his shop was a general rendezvous for the\r\nliterary men of his time. He wrote the _Memoirs of the Life and Writings of\r\nMr. William Whiston_ (1749, with another edition in 1753). He was one of\r\nthe first to issue regular catalogues of books with prices affixed.\r\n\r\n[312] The name appears both as Hulls and as Hull. He was born in\r\nGloucestershire in 1699. In 1754 he published _The Art of Measuring made\r\nEasy by the help of a new Sliding Scale_.\r\n\r\n[313] Thomas Newcomen (1663-1729) invented the first practical steam engine\r\nabout 1710. It was of about five and a half horse power, and was used for\r\npumping water from coal mines. Savery had described such an engine in 1702,\r\nbut Newcomen improved upon it and made it practical.\r\n\r\n[314] The well-known benefactor of art (1787-1863).\r\n\r\n[315] The tract was again reprinted in 1860.\r\n\r\n[316] Hulls made his experiment on the Avon, at Evesham, in 1737, having\r\npatented his machine in 1736. He had a Newcomen engine connected with six\r\npaddles. This was placed in the front of a small tow boat. The experiment\r\nwas a failure.\r\n\r\n[317] William Symington (1763-1831). In 1786 he constructed a working model\r\nof a steam road carriage. The machinery was applied to a small boat in\r\n1788, and with such success as to be tried on a larger boat in 1789. The\r\nmachinery was clumsy, however, and in 1801 he took out a new patent for the\r\nstyle of engine still used on paddle wheel steamers. This engine was\r\nsuccessfully used in 1802, on the Charlotte Dundas. Fulton (1765-1815) was\r\non board, and so impressed Robert Livingston with the idea that the latter\r\nfurnished the money to build the Clermont (1807), the beginning of\r\nsuccessful river navigation.\r\n\r\n[318] Louis Bertrand Castel (1688-1757), most of whose life was spent in\r\ntrying to perfect his _Clavecin oculaire_, an instrument on the order of\r\nthe harpsichord, intended to produce melodies and harmonies of color. He\r\nalso wrote _L'Optique des couleurs_ (1740) and _Sur le fond de la Musique_\r\n(1754).\r\n\r\n[319] Dr. Robinson (1680-1754) was professor of physic at Trinity College,\r\nDublin, and three times president of King and Queen's College of\r\nPhysicians. In his _Treatise on the Animal Economy_ (1732-3, with a third\r\nedition in 1738) he anticipated the discoveries of Lavoisier and Priestley\r\non the nature of oxygen.\r\n\r\n[320] There was another edition, published at London in 1747, 8vo.\r\n\r\n[321] The author seems to have shot his only bolt in this work. I can find\r\nnothing about him.\r\n\r\n[322] _Quod Deus sit, mundusque ab ipso creatus fuerit in tempore, ejusque\r\nprovidentia gubernetur. Selecta aliquot theoremata adversos atheos_, etc.,\r\nParis, 1635, 4to.\r\n\r\n[323] The British Museum Catalogue mentions a copy of 1740, but this is\r\npossibly a misprint.\r\n\r\n[324] This was Johann II (1710-1790), son of Johann I, who succeeded his\r\nfather as professor of mathematics at Basel.\r\n\r\n[325] Samuel Koenig (1712-1757), who studied under Johann Bernoulli I. He\r\nbecame professor of mathematics at Franeker (1747) and professor of\r\nphilosophy at the Hague (1749).\r\n\r\n[326] \"In accordance with the hypotheses laid down in this memoir it is so\r\nevident that t must = 34, y = 1, and z = 1, that there is no need of proof\r\nor authority for it to be recognized by every one.\"\r\n\r\n[327] \"I subscribe to the judgment of Mr. Bernoulli as a result of these\r\nhypotheses.\"\r\n\r\n[328] \"It clearly appears from my present analysis and demonstration that\r\nthey have already recognized and perfectly agreed to the fact that the\r\nquadrature of the circle is mathematically demonstrated.\"\r\n\r\n[329] Dr. Knight (died in 1772) made some worthy contributions to the\r\nliterature of the mariner's compass. As De Morgan states, he was librarian\r\nof the British Museum.\r\n\r\n[330] Sir Anthony Panizzi (1797-1879) fled from Italy under sentence of\r\ndeath (1822). He became assistant (1831) and chief (1856) librarian of the\r\nBritish Museum, and was knighted in 1869. He began the catalogue of printed\r\nbooks of the Museum.\r\n\r\n[331] Wright (1711-1786) was a physicist. He was offered the professorship\r\nof mathematics at the Imperial Academy of St. Petersburg but declined to\r\naccept it. This work is devoted chiefly to the theory of the Milky Way, the\r\n_via lactea_ as he calls it after the manner of the older writers.\r\n\r\n[332] Troughton (1753-1835) was one of the world's greatest instrument\r\nmakers. He was apprenticed to his brother John, and the two succeeded\r\n(1770) Wright and Cole in Fleet Street. Airy called his method of\r\ngraduating circles the greatest improvement ever made in instrument making.\r\nHe constructed (1800) the first modern transit circle, and his instruments\r\nwere used in many of the chief observatories of the world.\r\n\r\n[333] William Simms (1793-1860) was taken into partnership by Troughton\r\n(1826) after the death of the latter's brother. The firm manufactured some\r\nwell-known instruments.\r\n\r\n[334] This was George Horne (1730-1792), fellow of Magdalen College,\r\nOxford, vice-Chancellor of the University (1776), Dean of Canterbury\r\n(1781), and Bishop of Norwich (1790). He was a great satirist, but most of\r\nhis pamphlets against men like Adam Smith, Swedenborg, and Hume, were\r\nanonymous, as in the case of this one against Newton. He was so liberal in\r\nhis attitude towards the Methodists that he would not have John Wesley\r\nforbidden to preach in his diocese. He was twenty-one when this tract\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\n[335] Martin (1704-1782) was by no means \"old Benjamin Martin\" when Horne\r\nwrote this pamphlet in 1749. In fact he was then only forty-five. He was a\r\nphysicist and a well-known writer on scientific instruments. He also wrote\r\n_Philosophia Britannica or a new and comprehensive system of the Newtonian\r\nPhilosophy_ (1759).\r\n\r\n[336] Jean Theophile Desaguliers, or Des Aguliers (1683-1744) was the son\r\nof a Protestant who left France after the revocation of the Edict of\r\nNantes. He became professor of physics at Oxford, and afterwards gave\r\nlectures in London. Later he became chaplain to the Prince of Wales. He\r\npublished several works on physics.\r\n\r\n[337] Charles Hutton (1737-1823), professor of mathematics at Woolwich\r\n(1772-1807). His _Mathematical Tables_ (1785) and _Mathematical and\r\nPhilosophical Dictionary_ (1795-1796) are well known.\r\n\r\n[338] James Epps (1773-1839) contributed a number of memoirs on the use and\r\ncorrections of instruments. He was assistant secretary of the Astronomical\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\n[339] John Hutchinson (1674-1737) was one of the first to try to reconcile\r\nthe new science of geology with Genesis. He denied the Newtonian hypothesis\r\nas dangerous to religion, and because it necessitated a vacuum. He was a\r\nmystic in his interpretation of the Scriptures, and created a sect that\r\nwent under the name of Hutchinsonians.\r\n\r\n[340] John Rowning, a Lincolnshire rector, died in 1771. He wrote on\r\nphysics, and published a memoir on _A machine for finding the roots of\r\nequations universally_ (1770).\r\n\r\n[341] It is always difficult to sanction this spelling of the name of this\r\nJesuit father who is so often mentioned in the analytic treatment of\r\nconics. He was born in Ragusa in 1711, and the original spelling was\r\nRu[=d]er Josip Bo[vs]kovi['c]. When he went to live in Italy, as professor\r\nof mathematics at Rome (1740) and at Pavia, the name was spelled Ruggiero\r\nGiuseppe Boscovich, although Boscovicci would seem to a foreigner more\r\nnatural. His astronomical work was notable, and in his _De maculis\r\nsolaribus_ (1736) there is the first determination of the equator of a\r\nplanet by observing the motion of spots on its surface. Boscovich came near\r\nhaving some contact with America, for he was delegated to observe in\r\nCalifornia the transit of Venus in 1755, being prevented by the dissolution\r\nof his order just at that time. He died in 1787, at Milan.\r\n\r\n[342] James Granger (1723-1776) who wrote the _Biographical History of\r\nEngland_, London, 1769. His collection of prints was remarkable, numbering\r\nsome fourteen thousand.\r\n\r\n[343] He was curator of experiments for the Royal Society. He wrote a large\r\nnumber of books and monographs on physics. He died about 1713.\r\n\r\n[344] Lee seems to have made no impression on biographers.\r\n\r\n[345] This work appeared at London in 1852.\r\n\r\n[346] Of course this is no longer true. The most scholarly work to-day is\r\nthat of Rudio, _Archimedes, Huygens, Lambert, Legendre, vier Abhandlungen\r\nueber die Kreismessung ... mit einer Uebersicht ueber die Geschichte des\r\nProblems von der Quadratur des Zirkels, von den aeltesten Zeiten bis auf\r\nunsere Tage_, Leipsic, 1892.\r\n\r\n[347] Joseph Jerome le Francois de Lalande (1732-1807), professor of\r\nastronomy in the College de France (1753) and director of the Paris\r\nObservatory (1761). His writings on astronomy and his _Bibliographie\r\nastronomique, avec l'histoire de l'astronomie depuis 1781 jusqu'en 1802_\r\n(Paris, 1803) are well known.\r\n\r\n[348] De Morgan refers to his _Histoire de l'Astronomie au 18e siecle_,\r\nwhich appeared in 1827, five years after Delambre's death. Jean Baptiste\r\nJoseph Delambre (1749-1822) was a pupil of and a collaborator with Lalande,\r\nfollowing his master as professor of astronomy in the College de France.\r\nHis work on the measurements for the metric system is well known, and his\r\nfour histories of astronomy, _ancienne_ (1817), _au moyen age_ (1819),\r\n_moderne_ (1821), and _au 18e siecle_ (posthumous, 1827) are highly\r\nesteemed.\r\n\r\n[349] Jean-Joseph Rive (1730-1792), a priest who left his cure under grave\r\ncharges, and a quarrelsome character. His attack on Montucla was a case of\r\nthe pot calling the kettle black; for while he was a brilliant writer he\r\nwas a careless bibliographer.\r\n\r\n[350] Isaac Barrow (1630-1677) was quite as well known as a theologian as\r\nhe was from his Lucasian professorship of mathematics at Cambridge.\r\n\r\n[351] \"Besides we can see by this that Barrow was a poor philosopher; for\r\nhe believed in the immortality of the soul and in a Divinity other than\r\nuniversal nature.\"\r\n\r\n[352] The _Recreations mathematiques et physiques_ (Paris, 1694) of Jacques\r\nOzanam (1640-1717) is a work that is still highly esteemed. Among various\r\nother works he wrote a _Dictionnaire mathematique ou Idee generale des\r\nmathematiques_ (1690) that was not without merit. The _Recreations_ went\r\nthrough numerous editions (Paris, 1694, 1696, 1741, 1750, 1770, 1778, and\r\nthe Montucla edition of 1790; London, 1708, the Montucla-Hutton edition of\r\n1803 and the Riddle edition of 1840; Dublin, 1790).\r\n\r\n[353] Hendryk van Etten, the _nom de plume_ of Jean Leurechon (1591-1670),\r\nrector of the Jesuit college at Bar, and professor of philosophy and\r\nmathematics. He wrote on astronomy (1619) and horology (1616), and is known\r\nfor his _Selecta Propositiones in tota sparsim mathematica pulcherrime\r\npropositae in solemni festo SS. Ignatii et Francesci Xaverii_, 1622. The\r\nbook to which De Morgan refers is his _Recreation mathematicque, composee\r\nde plusieurs problemes plaisants et facetieux_, Lyons, 1627, with an\r\nedition at Pont-a-Mousson, 1629. There were English editions published at\r\nLondon in 1633, 1653, and 1674, and Dutch editions in 1662 and 1672.\r\n\r\nI do not understand how De Morgan happened to miss owning the work by\r\nClaude Gaspar Bachet de Meziriac (1581-1638), _Problemes plaisans et\r\ndelectables_, which appeared at Lyons in 1612, 8vo, with a second edition\r\nin 1624. There was a fifth edition published at Paris in 1884.\r\n\r\n[354] His title page closes with \"Paris, Chez Ch. Ant. Jombert.... M DCC\r\nLIV.\"\r\n\r\nThis was Charles-Antoine Jombert (1712-1784), a printer and bookseller with\r\nsome taste for painting and architecture. He wrote several works and edited\r\na number of early treatises.\r\n\r\n[355] The late Professor Newcomb made the matter plain even to the\r\nnon-mathematical mind, when he said that \"ten decimal places are sufficient\r\nto give the circumference of the earth to the fraction of an inch, and\r\nthirty decimal places would give the circumference of the whole visible\r\nuniverse to a quantity imperceptible with the most powerful microscope.\"\r\n\r\n[356] _Antinewtonianismi pars prima, in qua Newtoni de coloribus systema ex\r\npropriis principiis geometrice evertitur, et nova de coloribus theoria\r\nluculentissimis experimentis demonstrantur_.... Naples, 1754; _pars\r\nsecunda_, Naples, 1756.\r\n\r\n[357] Celestino Cominale (1722-1785) was professor of medicine at the\r\nUniversity of Naples.\r\n\r\n[358] The work appeared in the years from 1844 to 1849.\r\n\r\n[359] There was a Vienna edition in 1758, 4to, and another in 1759, 4to.\r\nThis edition is described on the title page as _Editio Veneta prima ipso\r\nauctore praesente, et corrigente_.\r\n\r\n[360] The first edition was entitled _De solis ac lunae defectibus libri\r\nV. P. Rogerii Josephi Boscovich ... cum ejusdem auctoris adnotationibus_,\r\nLondon, 1760. It also appeared in Venice in 1761, and in French translation\r\nby the Abbe de Baruel in 1779, and was a work of considerable influence.\r\n\r\n[361] Paulian (1722-1802) was professor of physics at the Jesuit college at\r\nAvignon. He wrote several works, the most popular of which, the\r\n_Dictionnaire de physique_ (Avignon, 1761), went through nine editions by\r\n1789.\r\n\r\n[362] This is correct.\r\n\r\n[363] Probably referring to the fact that Hill (1795-1879), who had done so\r\nmuch for postal reform, was secretary to the postmaster general (1846), and\r\nhis name was a synonym for the post office directory.\r\n\r\n[364] Richard Lovett (1692-1780) was a good deal of a charlatan. He claimed\r\nto have studied electrical phenomena, and in 1758 advertised that he could\r\neffect marvelous cures, especially of sore throat, by means of electricity.\r\nBefore publishing the works mentioned by De Morgan he had issued others of\r\nsimilar character, including _The Subtile Medium proved_ (London, 1756) and\r\n_The Reviewers Reviewed_ (London, 1760).\r\n\r\n[365] Jean Sylvain Bailly (1736-1793), member of the _Academie francaise_\r\nand of the _Academie des sciences_, first deputy elected to represent Paris\r\nin the _Etats-generaux_ (1789), president of the first National Assembly,\r\nand mayor of Paris (1789-1791). For his vigor as mayor in keeping the\r\npeace, and for his manly defence of the Queen, he was guillotined. He was\r\nan astronomer of ability, but is best known for his histories of the\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n[366] These were the _Histoire de l'Astronomie ancienne_ (1775), _Histoire\r\nde l'Astronomie moderne_ (1778-1783), _Histoire de l'Astronomie indienne et\r\norientale_ (1787), and _Lettres sur l'origine des peuples de l'Asie_\r\n(1775).\r\n\r\n[367] \"The sick old man of Ferney, V., a boy of a hundred years.\" Voltaire\r\nwas born in 1694, and hence was eighty-three at this time.\r\n\r\n[368] In Palmezeaux's _Vie de Bailly_, in Bailly's _Ouvrage Posthume_\r\n(1810), M. de Sales is quoted as saying that the _Lettres sur l'Atlantide_\r\nwere sent to Voltaire and that the latter did not approve of the theory set\r\nforth.\r\n\r\n[369] The British Museum catalogue gives two editions, 1781 and 1782.\r\n\r\n[370] A mystic and a spiritualist. His chief work was the one mentioned\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n[371] Jacob Behmen, or Boehme (1575-1624), known as \"the German\r\ntheosophist,\" was founder of the sect of Boehmists, a cult allied to the\r\nSwedenborgians. He was given to the study of alchemy, and brought the\r\nvocabulary of the science into his mystic writings. His sect was revived in\r\nEngland in the eighteenth century through the efforts of William Law.\r\nSaint-Martin translated into French two of his Latin works under the titles\r\n_L'Aurore naissante, ou la Racine de la philosophie_ (1800), and _Les trois\r\nprincipes de l'essence divine_ (1802). The originals had appeared nearly\r\ntwo hundred years earlier,--_Aurora_ in 1612, and _De tribus principiis_ in\r\n1619.\r\n\r\n[372] \"Unknown.\"\r\n\r\n[373] \"Skeptical.\"\r\n\r\n[374] \"Man, man, man.\"\r\n\r\n[375] \"Men, men, men.\"\r\n\r\n[376] It is interesting to read De Morgan's argument against Saint-Martin's\r\nauthorship of this work. It is attributed to Saint-Martin both by the\r\n_Biographie Universelle_ and by the _British Museum Catalogue_, and De\r\nMorgan says by \"various catalogues and biographies.\"\r\n\r\n[377] \"To explain things by man and not man by things. _On Errors and\r\nTruth_, by a Ph.... Inc....\"\r\n\r\n[378] \"If we would preserve ourselves from all illusions, and above all\r\nfrom the allurements of pride, by which man is so often seduced, we should\r\nnever take man, but always God, for our term of comparison.\"\r\n\r\n[379] \"And here is found already an explanation of the numbers four and\r\nnine which caused some perplexity in the work cited above. Man is lost in\r\npassing from four to nine.\"\r\n\r\n[380] Williams also took part in the preparation of some tables for the\r\ngovernment to assist in the determination of longitude. He had published a\r\nwork two years before the one here cited, on the same subject,--_An entire\r\nnew work and method to discover the variation of the Earth's Diameters_,\r\nLondon, 1786.\r\n\r\n[381] This is Gabriel Mouton (1618-1694), a vicar at Lyons, who suggested\r\nas a basis for a natural system of measures the _mille_, a minute of a\r\ndegree of the meridian. This appeared in his _Observationes diametrorum\r\nsolis et lunae apparentium, meridianarumque aliquot altitudinum cum tabula\r\ndeclinationum solis_.... Lyons, 1670.\r\n\r\n[382] Jacques Cassini (1677-1756), one of the celebrated Cassini family of\r\nastronomers. After the death of his father he became director of the\r\nobservatory at Paris. The basis for a metric unit was set forth by him in\r\nhis _Traite de la grandeur et de la figure de la terre_, Paris, 1720. He\r\nwas a prolific writer on astronomy.\r\n\r\n[383] Alexis Jean Pierre Paucton (1732-1798). He was, for a time, professor\r\nof mathematics at Strassburg, but later (1796) held office in Paris. His\r\nleading contribution to metrology was his _Metrologie ou Traite des\r\nmesures_, Paris, 1780.\r\n\r\n[384] He was an obscure writer, born at Deptford.\r\n\r\n[385] He was also a writer of no scientific merit, his chief contributions\r\nbeing religious tracts. One of his productions, however, went through many\r\neditions, even being translated into French; _Three dialogues between a\r\nMinister and one of his Parishioners; on the true principles of Religion\r\nand salvation for sinners by Jesus Christ_. The twentieth edition appeared\r\nat Cambridge in 1786.\r\n\r\n[386] This was the _Reflections on the Revolution in France, and on the\r\nproceedings in certain societies in London relative to that event_ (London,\r\n1790) by Edmund Burke (1729-1797). Eleven editions of the work appeared the\r\nfirst year.\r\n\r\n[387] Paine (1736-1809) was born in Norfolkshire, of Quaker parents. He\r\nwent to America at the beginning of the Revolution and published, in\r\nJanuary 1776, a violent pamphlet entitled _Common Sense_. He was a private\r\nsoldier under Washington, and on his return to England after the war he\r\npublished _The Rights of Man_. He was indicted for treason and was outlawed\r\nto France. He was elected to represent Calais at the French convention, but\r\nhis plea for moderation led him perilously near the guillotine. His _Age of\r\nReason_ (1794) was dedicated to Washington. He returned to America in 1802\r\nand remained there until his death.\r\n\r\n[388] Part I appeared in 1791 and was so popular that eight editions\r\nappeared in that year. It was followed in 1792 by Part II, of which nine\r\neditions appeared in that year. Both parts were immediately republished in\r\nParis, and there have been several subsequent editions.\r\n\r\n[389] Mary Wollstonecraft (1759-1797) was only thirty-three when this work\r\ncame out. She had already published _An historical and moral View of the\r\nOrigin and Progress of the French Revolution_ (1790), and _Original Stories\r\nfrom Real Life_ (1791). She went to Paris in 1792 and remained during the\r\nReign of Terror.\r\n\r\n[390] Samuel Parr (1747-1827) was for a time head assistant at Harrow\r\n(1767-1771), afterwards headmaster in other schools. At the time this book\r\nwas written he was vicar of Hatton, where he took private pupils\r\n(1785-1798) to the strictly limited number of seven. He was a violent Whig\r\nand a caustic writer.\r\n\r\n[391] On Mary Wollstonecraft's return from France she married (1797)\r\nWilliam Godwin (1756-1836). He had started as a strong Calvinistic\r\nNonconformist minister, but had become what would now be called an\r\nanarchist, at least by conservatives. He had written an _Inquiry concerning\r\nPolitical Justice_ (1793) and a novel entitled _Caleb Williams, or Things\r\nas they are_ (1794), both of which were of a nature to attract his future\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n[392] This child was a daughter. She became Shelley's wife, and Godwin's\r\ninfluence on Shelley was very marked.\r\n\r\n[393] This was John Nichols (1745-1826), the publisher and antiquary. He\r\nedited the _Gentleman's Magazine_ (1792-1826) and his works include the\r\n_Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century_ (1812-1815), to which De\r\nMorgan here refers.\r\n\r\n[394] William Bellenden, a Scotch professor at the University of Paris, who\r\ndied about 1633. His textbooks are now forgotten, but Parr edited an\r\nedition of his works in 1787. The Latin preface, _Praefatio ad Bellendum de\r\nStatu_, was addressed to Burke, North, and Fox, and was a satire on their\r\npolitical opponents.\r\n\r\n[395] As we have seen, he had been head-master before he began taking \"his\r\nhandful of private pupils.\"\r\n\r\n[396] The story has evidently got mixed up in the telling, for Tom Sheridan\r\n(1721-1788), the great actor, was old enough to have been Dr. Parr's\r\nfather. It was his son, Richard Brinsley Sheridan (1751-1816), the\r\ndramatist and politician, who was the pupil of Parr. He wrote _The Rivals_\r\n(1775) and _The School for Scandal_ (1777) soon after Parr left Harrow.\r\n\r\n[397] Horner (1785-1864) was a geologist and social reformer. He was very\r\ninfluential in improving the conditions of child labor.\r\n\r\n[398] William Cobbett (1762-1835), the journalist, was a character not\r\nwithout interest to Americans. Born in Surrey, he went to America at the\r\nage of thirty and remained there eight years. Most of this time he was\r\noccupied as a bookseller in Philadelphia, and while thus engaged he was\r\nfined for libel against the celebrated Dr. Rush. On his return to England\r\nhe edited the _Weekly Political Register_ (1802-1835), a popular journal\r\namong the working classes. He was fined and imprisoned for two years\r\nbecause of his attack (1810) on military flogging, and was also (1831)\r\nprosecuted for sedition. He further showed his paradox nature by his\r\n_History of the Protestant Reformation_ (1824-1827), an attack on the\r\nprevailing Protestant opinion. He also wrote a _Life of Andrew Jackson_\r\n(1834). After repeated attempts he succeeded in entering parliament, a\r\nresult of the Reform Bill.\r\n\r\n[399] Robinson (1735-1790) was a Baptist minister who wrote several\r\ntheological works and a number of hymns. His work at Cambridge so offended\r\nthe students that they at one time broke up the services.\r\n\r\n[400] This work had passed through twelve editions by 1823.\r\n\r\n[401] Dyer (1755-1841), the poet and reformer, edited Robinson's\r\n_Ecclesiastical Researches_ (1790). He was a life-long friend of Charles\r\nLamb, and in their boyhood they were schoolmates at Christ's Hospital. His\r\n_Complaints of the Poor People of England_ (1793) made him a worthy\r\ncompanion of the paradoxers above mentioned.\r\n\r\n[402] These were John Thelwall (1764-1834) whose _Politics for the People\r\nor Hogswash_ (1794) took its title from the fact that Burke called the\r\npeople the \"swinish multitude.\" The book resulted in sending the author to\r\nthe Tower for sedition. In 1798 he gave up politics and started a school of\r\nelocution which became very famous. Thomas Hardy (1752-1832), who kept a\r\nbootmaker's shop in Piccadilly, was a fellow prisoner with Thelwall, being\r\narrested for high treason. He was founder (1792) of The London\r\nCorresponding Society, a kind of clearing house for radical associations\r\nthroughout the country. Horne Tooke was really John Horne (1736-1812), he\r\nhaving taken the name of his friend William Tooke in 1782. He was a radical\r\nof the radicals, and organized a number of reform societies. Among these\r\nwas the Constitutional Society that voted money (1775) to assist the\r\nAmerican revolutionists, appointing him to give the contribution to\r\nFranklin. For this he was imprisoned for a year. With his fellow rebels in\r\nthe Tower in 1794, however, he was acquitted. As a philologist he is known\r\nfor his early advocacy of the study of Anglo-Saxon and Gothic, and his\r\n_Diversions of Purley_ (1786) is still known to readers.\r\n\r\n[403] This was the admiral, Adam Viscount Duncan (1731-1804), who defeated\r\nthe Dutch off Camperdown in 1797.\r\n\r\n[404] He was created Duke of Clarence and St. Andrews in 1789 and was\r\nAdmiral of the Fleet escorting Louis XVIII on his return to France in 1814.\r\nHe became Lord High Admiral in 1827, and reigned as William IV from 1830 to\r\n1837.\r\n\r\n[405] This was Charles Abbott (1762-1832) first Lord Tenterden. He\r\nsucceeded Lord Ellenborough as Chief Justice (1818) and was raised to the\r\npeerage in 1827. He was a strong Tory and opposed the Catholic Relief Bill,\r\nthe Reform Bill, and the abolition of the death penalty for forgery.\r\n\r\n[406] Edward Law (1750-1818), first Baron Ellenborough. He was chief\r\ncounsel for Warren Hastings, and his famous speech in defense of his client\r\nis well known. He became Chief Justice and was raised to the peerage in\r\n1802. He opposed all efforts to modernize the criminal code, insisting upon\r\nthe reactionary principle of new death penalties.\r\n\r\n[407] Edmund Law (1703-1787), Bishop of Carlisle (1768), was a good deal\r\nmore liberal than his son. His _Considerations on the Propriety of\r\nrequiring subscription to the Articles of Faith_ (1774) was published\r\nanonymously. In it he asserts that not even the clergy should be required\r\nto subscribe to the thirty-nine articles.\r\n\r\n[408] Joe Miller (1684-1738), the famous Drury Lane comedian, was so\r\nilliterate that he could not have written the _Joe Miller's Jests, or the\r\nWit's Vade-Mecum_ that appeared the year after his death. It was often\r\nreprinted and probably contained more or less of Miller's own jokes.\r\n\r\n[409] The sixth duke (1766-1839) was much interested in parliamentary\r\nreform. He was a member of the Society of Friends of the People. He was for\r\nfourteen years a member of parliament (1788-1802) and was later Lord\r\nLieutenant of Ireland (1806-1807). He afterwards gave up politics and\r\nbecame interested in agricultural matters.\r\n\r\n[410] George Jeffreys (c. 1648-1689), the favorite of James II, who was\r\nactive in prosecuting the Rye House conspirators. He was raised to the\r\npeerage in 1684 and held the famous \"bloody assize\" in the following year,\r\nbeing made Lord Chancellor as a result. He was imprisoned in the Tower by\r\nWilliam III and died there.\r\n\r\n[411] _The Every Day Book, forming a Complete History of the Year, Months,\r\nand Seasons, and a perpetual Key to the Almanack_, 1826-1827.\r\n\r\n[412] The first and second editions appeared in 1820. Two others followed\r\nin 1821.\r\n\r\n[413] _The three trials of W. H., for publishing three parodies; viz the\r\nlate John Wilkes' Catechism, the Political Litany, and the Sinecurists\r\nCreed; on three ex-officio informations, at Guildhall, London, ... Dec. 18,\r\n19, & 20, 1817_,... London, 1818.\r\n\r\n[414] The _Political Litany_ appeared in 1817.\r\n\r\n[415] That is, Castlereagh's.\r\n\r\n[416] The well-known caricaturist (1792-1878), then only twenty-nine years\r\nold.\r\n\r\n[417] Robert Stewart (1769-1822) was second Marquis of Londonderry and\r\nViscount Castlereagh. As Chief Secretary for Ireland he was largely\r\ninstrumental in bringing about the union of Ireland and Great Britain. He\r\nwas at the head of the war department during most of the Napoleonic wars,\r\nand was to a great extent responsible for the European coalition against\r\nthe Emperor. He suicided in 1822.\r\n\r\n[418] John Murray (1778-1843), the well-known London publisher. He refused\r\nto finish the publication of Don Juan, after the first five cantos, because\r\nof his Tory principles.\r\n\r\n[419] Only the first two cantos appeared in 1819.\r\n\r\n[420] Proclus (412-485), one of the greatest of the neo-Platonists, studied\r\nat Alexandria and taught philosophy at Athens. He left commentaries on\r\nPlato and on part of Euclid's _Elements_.\r\n\r\n[421] Thomas Taylor (1758-1835), called \"the Platonist,\" had a liking for\r\nmathematics, and was probably led by his interest in number mysticism to a\r\nstudy of neo-Platonism. He translated a number of works from the Latin and\r\nGreek, and wrote two works on theoretical arithmetic (1816, 1823).\r\n\r\n[422] There was an earlier edition, 1788-89.\r\n\r\n[423] Georgius Gemistus, or Georgius Pletho (Plethon), lived in the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries. He was a native of Constantinople, but\r\nspent most of his time in Greece. He devoted much time to the propagation\r\nof the Platonic philosophy, but also wrote on divinity, geography, and\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n[424] Hannah More (1745-1833), was, in her younger days, a friend of Burke,\r\nReynolds, Dr. Johnson, and Garrick. At this time she wrote a number of\r\npoems and aspired to become a dramatist. Her _Percy_ (1777), with a\r\nprologue and epilogue by Garrick, had a long run at Covent Garden. Somewhat\r\nlater she came to believe that the playhouse was a grave public evil, and\r\nrefused to attend the revival of her own play with Mrs. Siddons in the\r\nleading part. After 1789 she and her sisters devoted themselves to starting\r\nschools for poor children, teaching them religion and housework, but\r\nleaving them illiterate.\r\n\r\n[425] These were issued at the rate of three each month,--a story, a\r\nballad, and a Sunday tract. They were collected and published in one volume\r\nin 1795. It is said that two million copies were sold the first year. There\r\nwere also editions in 1798, 1819, 1827, and 1836-37.\r\n\r\n[426] That is, Dr. Johnson (1709-1784). The _Rambler_ was published in\r\n1750-1752, and was an imitation of Addison's _Spectator_.\r\n\r\n[427] Dr. Moore, referred to below.\r\n\r\n[428] Dr. John Moore (1729-1802), physician and novelist, is now best known\r\nfor his _Journal during a Residence in France from the beginning of August\r\nto the middle of December, 1792_, a work quoted frequently by Carlyle in\r\nhis _French Revolution_.\r\n\r\n[429] Sir John Moore (1761-1809), Lieutenant General in the Napoleonic\r\nwars. He was killed in the battle of Corunna. The poem by Charles Wolfe\r\n(1791-1823), _The Burial of Sir John Moore_ (1817), is well known.\r\n\r\n[430] Referring to the novels of Thomas Love Peacock (1785-1866), who\r\nsucceeded James Mill as chief examiner of the East India Company, and was\r\nin turn succeeded by John Stuart Mill.\r\n\r\n[431] Frances Burney, Madame d'Arblay (1752-1840), married General\r\nd'Arblay, a French officer and companion of Lafayette, in 1793. She was\r\nonly twenty-five when she acquired fame by her _Evelina, or a Young Lady's\r\nEntrance into the World_. Her _Letters and Diaries_ appeared posthumously\r\n(1842-45).\r\n\r\n[432] Henry Peter, Baron Brougham and Vaux (1778-1868), well known in\r\npolitics, science, and letters. He was one of the founders of the\r\n_Edinburgh Review_, became Lord Chancellor in 1830, and took part with men\r\nlike William Frend, De Morgan's father-in-law, in the establishing of\r\nLondon University. He was also one of the founders of the Society for the\r\nDiffusion of Useful Knowledge. He was always friendly to De Morgan, who\r\nentered the faculty of London University, whose work on geometry was\r\npublished by the Society mentioned, and who was offered the degree of\r\ndoctor of laws by the University of Edinburgh while Lord Brougham was Lord\r\nRector. The Edinburgh honor was refused by De Morgan who said he \"did not\r\nfeel like an LL.D.\"\r\n\r\n[433] Maria Edgeworth (1767-1849).\r\n\r\n[434] Sydney Owenson (c. 1783-1859) married Sir Thomas Morgan, a well-known\r\nsurgeon, in 1812. Her Irish stories were very popular with the patriots but\r\nwere attacked by the _Quarterly Review_. _The Wild Irish Girl_ (1806) went\r\nthrough seven editions in two years.\r\n\r\n[435] 1775-1817.\r\n\r\n[436] 1771-1832.\r\n\r\n[437] The famous preacher (1732-1808). He was the first chairman of the\r\nReligious Tract Society. He is also known as one of the earliest advocates\r\nof vaccination, in his _Cow-pock Inoculation vindicated and recommended\r\nfrom matters of fact_, 1806.\r\n\r\n[438] Sir Rowland Hill (1795-1879), the father of penny postage.\r\n\r\n[439] Beilby Porteus (1731-1808), Bishop of Chester (1776) and Bishop of\r\nLondon (1787). He encouraged the Sunday-school movement and the\r\ndissemination of Hannah More's tracts. He was an active opponent of\r\nslavery, but also of Catholic emancipation.\r\n\r\n[440] Henrietta Maria Bowdler (1754-1830), generally known as Mrs. Harriet\r\nBowdler. She was the author of many religious tracts and poems. Her _Poems\r\nand Essays_ (1786) were often reprinted. The story goes that on the\r\nappearance of her _Sermons on the Doctrines and duties of Christianity_\r\n(published anonymously), Bishop Porteus offered the author a living under\r\nthe impression that it was written by a man.\r\n\r\n[441] William Frend (1757-1841), whose daughter Sophia Elizabeth became De\r\nMorgan's wife (1837), was at one time a clergyman of the Established\r\nChurch, but was converted to Unitarianism (1787). He came under De Morgan's\r\ndefinition of a true paradoxer, carrying on a zealous warfare for what he\r\nthought right. As a result of his _Address to the Inhabitants of Cambridge_\r\n(1787), and his efforts to have abrogated the requirement that candidates\r\nfor the M.A. must subscribe to the thirty-nine articles, he was deprived of\r\nhis tutorship in 1788. A little later he was banished (see De Morgan's\r\nstatement in the text) from Cambridge because of his denunciation of the\r\nabuses of the Church and his condemnation of the liturgy. His eccentricity\r\nis seen in his declining to use negative quantities in the operations of\r\nalgebra. He finally became an actuary at London and was prominent in\r\nradical associations. He was a mathematician of ability, having been second\r\nwrangler and having nearly attained the first place, and he was also an\r\nexcellent scholar in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew.\r\n\r\n[442] George Peacock (1791-1858), Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge,\r\nLowndean professor of astronomy, and Dean of Ely Cathedral (1839). His tomb\r\nmay be seen at Ely where he spent the latter part of his life. He was one\r\nof the group that introduced the modern continental notation of the\r\ncalculus into England, replacing the cumbersome notation of Newton, passing\r\nfrom \"the _dot_age of fluxions to the _de_ism of the calculus.\"\r\n\r\n[443] Robert Simson (1687-1768); professor of mathematics at Glasgow. His\r\nrestoration of Apollonius (1749) and his translation and restoration of\r\nEuclid (1756, and 1776--posthumous) are well known.\r\n\r\n[444] Francis Maseres (1731-1824), a prominent lawyer. His mathematical\r\nworks had some merit.\r\n\r\n[445] These appeared annually from 1804 to 1822.\r\n\r\n[446] Henry Gunning (1768-1854) was senior esquire bedell of Cambridge. The\r\n_Reminiscences_ appeared in two volumes in 1854.\r\n\r\n[447] John Singleton Copley, Baron Lyndhurst (1772-1863), the son of John\r\nSingleton Copley the portrait painter, was born in Boston. He was educated\r\nat Trinity College, Cambridge, and became a lawyer. He was made Lord\r\nChancellor in 1827.\r\n\r\n[448] Sir William Rough (c. 1772-1838), a lawyer and poet, became Chief\r\nJustice of Ceylon in 1836. He was knighted in 1837.\r\n\r\n[449] Herbert Marsh, afterwards Bishop of Peterborough, a relation of my\r\nfather.--S. E. De M.\r\n\r\nHe was born in 1757 and died in 1839. On the trial of Frend he publicly\r\nprotested against testifying against a personal confidant, and was excused.\r\nHe was one of the first of the English clergy to study modern higher\r\ncriticism of the Bible, and amid much opposition he wrote numerous works on\r\nthe subject. He was professor of theology at Cambridge (1707), Bishop of\r\nLlandaff (1816), and Bishop of Peterborough.\r\n\r\n[450] George Butler (1774-1853), Headmaster of Harrow (1805-1829),\r\nChancellor of Peterborough (1836), and Dean of Peterborough (1842).\r\n\r\n[451] James Tate (1771-1843), Headmaster of Richmond School (1796-1833) and\r\nCanon of St. Paul's Cathedral (1833). He left several works on the\r\nclassics.\r\n\r\n[452] Francis Place (1771-1854), at first a journeyman breeches maker, and\r\nlater a master tailor. He was a hundred years ahead of his time as a strike\r\nleader, but was not so successful as an agitator as he was as a tailor,\r\nsince his shop in Charing Cross made him wealthy. He was a well-known\r\nradical, and it was largely due to his efforts that the law against the\r\ncombinations of workmen was repealed in 1824. His chief work was _The\r\nPrinciples of Population_ (1822).\r\n\r\n[453] Speed (1552-1629) was a tailor until Grevil (Greville) made him\r\nindependent of his trade. He was not only an historian of some merit, but a\r\nskilful cartographer. His maps of the counties were collected in the\r\n_Theatre of the Empire of Great Britaine_, 1611. About this same time he\r\nalso published _Genealogies recorded in Sacred Scripture_, a work that had\r\npassed through thirty-two editions by 1640.\r\n\r\n[454] _The history of Great Britaine under the conquests of ye Romans,\r\nSaxons, Danes, and Normans...._ London, 1611, folio. The second edition\r\nappeared in 1623; the third, to which De Morgan here refers, posthumously\r\nin 1632; and the fourth in 1650.\r\n\r\n[455] William Nicolson (1655-1727) became Bishop of Carlisle in 1702, and\r\nBishop of Derry in 1718. His chief work was the _Historical Library_\r\n(1696-1724), in the form of a collection of documents and chronicles. It\r\nwas reprinted in 1736 and in 1776.\r\n\r\n[456] Sir Fulk Grevil, or Fulke Greville (1554-1628), was a favorite of\r\nQueen Elizabeth, Chancellor of the Exchequer under James I, a patron of\r\nliterature, and a friend of Sir Philip Sidney.\r\n\r\n[457] See note 443 on page 197.\r\n\r\n[458] See note 444 on page 197.\r\n\r\n[459] See note 439 on page 193.\r\n\r\n[460] Edward Waring (1736-1796) was Lucasian professor of mathematics at\r\nCambridge. He published several works on analysis and curves. The work\r\nreferred to was the _Miscellanea Analytica de aequationibus algebraicis et\r\ncurvarum proprietatibus_, Cambridge, 1762.\r\n\r\n[461] _A Dissertation on the use of the Negative Sign in Algebra...; to\r\nwhich is added, Machin's Quadrature of the Circle_, London, 1758.\r\n\r\n[462] The paper was probably one on complex numbers, or possibly one on\r\nquaternions, in which direction as well as absolute value is involved.\r\n\r\n[463] De Morgan quotes from one of the Latin editions. Descartes wrote in\r\nFrench, the title of his first edition being: _Discours de la methode pour\r\nbien conduire sa raison et chercher la verite dans les sciences, plus la\r\ndioptrique, les meteores et la geometrie qui sont des essais de cette\r\nmethode_, Leyden, 1637, 4to.\r\n\r\n[464] \"I have observed that algebra indeed, as it is usually taught, is so\r\nrestricted by definite rules and formulas of calculation, that it seems\r\nrather a confused kind of an art, by the practice of which the mind is in a\r\ncertain manner disturbed and obscured, than a science by which it is\r\ncultivated and made acute.\"\r\n\r\n[465] It appeared in 93 volumes, from 1758 to 1851.\r\n\r\n[466] _The principles of the doctrine of life-annuities; explained in a\r\nfamiliar manner ... with a variety of new tables_ ..., London, 1783.\r\n\r\n[467] I suppose the one who wrote _Conjectures on the physical causes of\r\nEarthquakes and Volcanoes_, Dublin, 1820.\r\n\r\n[468] _Scriptores Logarithmici; or, a Collection of several curious_\r\n_tracts on the nature and construction of Logarithms ... together with same\r\ntracts on the Binomial Theorem_ ..., 6 vols., London, 1791-1807.\r\n\r\n[469] Charles Babbage (1792-1871), whose work on the calculating machine is\r\nwell known. Maseres was, it is true, ninety-two at this time, but Babbage\r\nwas thirty-one instead of twenty-nine. He had already translated Lacroix's\r\n_Treatise on the differential and integral calculus_ (1816), in\r\ncollaboration with Herschel and Peacock. He was Lucasian professor of\r\nmathematics at Cambridge from 1828 to 1839.\r\n\r\n[470] _The great and new Art of weighing Vanity, or a discovery of the\r\nignorance of the great and new artist in his pseudo-philosophical\r\nwritings._ The \"great and new artist\" was Sinclair.\r\n\r\n[471] George Sinclair, probably a native of East Lothian, who died in 1696.\r\nHe was professor of philosophy and mathematics at Glasgow, and was one of\r\nthe first to use the barometer in measuring altitudes. The work to which De\r\nMorgan refers is his _Hydrostaticks_ (1672). He was a firm believer in evil\r\nspirits, his work on the subject going through four editions: _Satan's\r\nInvisible World Discovered; or, a choice collection of modern relations,\r\nproving evidently against the Saducees and Athiests of this present age,\r\nthat there are Devils, Spirits, Witches, and Apparitions_, Edinburgh, 1685.\r\n\r\n[472] This was probably William Sanders, Regent of St. Leonard's College,\r\nwhose _Theses philosophicae_ appeared in 1674, and whose _Elementa\r\ngeometriae_ came out a dozen years later.\r\n\r\n[473] _Ars nova et magna gravitatis et levitatis; sive dialogorum\r\nphilosophicorum libri sex de aeris vera ac reali gravitate_, Rotterdam,\r\n1669, 4to.\r\n\r\n[474] Volume I, Nos. 1 and 2, appeared in 1803.\r\n\r\n[475] His daughter, Mrs. De Morgan, says in her _Memoir_ of her husband:\r\n\"My father had been second wrangler in a year in which the two highest were\r\nclose together, and was, as his son-in-law afterwards described him, an\r\nexceedingly clear thinker. It is possible, as Mr. De Morgan said, that this\r\nmental clearness and directness may have caused his mathematical heresy,\r\nthe rejection of the use of negative quantities in algebraical operations;\r\nand it is probable that he thus deprived himself of an instrument of work,\r\nthe use of which might have led him to greater eminence in the higher\r\nbranches.\" _Memoir of Augustus De Morgan_, London, 1882, p. 19.\r\n\r\n[476] \"If it is not true it is a good invention.\" A well-known Italian\r\nproverb.\r\n\r\n[477] See page 86, note 132.\r\n\r\n[478] He was born at Paris in 1713, and died there in 1765.\r\n\r\n[479] _Recherches sur les courbes a double courbure_, Paris, 1731. Clairaut\r\nwas then only eighteen, and was in the same year made a member of the\r\nAcademie des sciences. His _Elemens de geometrie_ appeared in 1741.\r\nMeantime he had taken part in the measurement of a degree in Lapland\r\n(1736-1737). His _Traite de la figure de la terre_ was published in 1741.\r\nThe Academy of St. Petersburg awarded him a prize for his _Theorie de la\r\nlune_ (1750). His various works on comets are well known, particularly his\r\n_Theorie du mouvement des cometes_ (1760) in which he applied the \"problem\r\nof three bodies\" to Halley's comet as retarded by Jupiter and Saturn.\r\n\r\n[480] Joseph Privat, Abbe de Molieres (1677-1742), was a priest of the\r\nCongregation of the Oratorium. In 1723 he became a professor in the College\r\nde France. He was well known as an astronomer and a mathematician, and\r\nwrote in defense of Descartes's theory of vortices (1728, 1729). He also\r\ncontributed to the methods of finding prime numbers (1705).\r\n\r\n[481] \"Deserves not only to be printed, but to be admired as a marvel of\r\nimagination, of understanding, and of ability.\"\r\n\r\n[482] Blaise Pascal (1623-1662), the well-known French philosopher and\r\nmathematician. He lived for some time with the Port Royalists, and defended\r\nthem against the Jesuits in his _Provincial Letters_. Among his works are\r\nthe following: _Essai pour les coniques_ (1640); _Recit de la grande\r\nexperience de l'equilibre des liqueurs_ (1648), describing his experiment\r\nin finding altitudes by barometric readings; _Histoire de la roulette_\r\n(1658); _Traite du triangle arithmetique_ (1665); _Aleae geometria_ (1654).\r\n\r\n[483] This proposition shows that if a hexagon is inscribed in a conic (in\r\nparticular a circle) and the opposite sides are produced to meet, the three\r\npoints determined by their intersections will be in the same straight line.\r\n\r\n[484] Jacques Curabelle, _Examen des Oeuvres du Sr. Desargues_, Paris,\r\n1644. He also published without date a work entitled: _Foiblesse pitoyable\r\ndu Sr. G. Desargues employee contre l'examen fait de ses oeuvres_.\r\n\r\n[485] See page 119, note 233.\r\n\r\n[486] Until \"this great proposition called Pascal's should see the light.\"\r\n\r\n[487] The story is that his father, Etienne Pascal, did not wish him to\r\nstudy geometry until he was thoroughly grounded in Latin and Greek. Having\r\nheard the nature of the subject, however, he began at the age of twelve to\r\nconstruct figures by himself, drawing them on the floor with a piece of\r\ncharcoal. When his father discovered what he was doing he was attempting to\r\ndemonstrate that the sum of the angles of a triangle equals two right\r\nangles. The story is given by his sister, Mme. Perier.\r\n\r\n[488] Sir John Wilson (1741-1793) was knighted in 1786 and became\r\nCommissioner of the Great Seal in 1792. He was a lawyer and jurist of\r\nrecognized merit. He stated his theorem without proof, the first\r\ndemonstration having been given by Lagrange in the Memoirs of the Berlin\r\nAcademy for 1771,--_Demonstration d'un theoreme nouveau concernant les\r\nnombres premiers_. Euler also gave a proof in his _Miscellanea Analytica_\r\n(1773). Fermat's works should be consulted in connection with the early\r\nhistory of this theorem.\r\n\r\n[489] He wrote, in 1760, a tract in defense of Waring, a point of whose\r\nalgebra had been assailed by a Dr. Powell. Waring wrote another tract of\r\nthe same date.--A. De M.\r\n\r\nWilliam Samuel Powell (1717-1775) was at this time a fellow of St. John's\r\nCollege, Cambridge. In 1765 he became Vice Chancellor of the University.\r\nWaring was a Magdalene man, and while candidate for the Lucasian\r\nprofessorship he circulated privately his _Miscellanea Analytica_. Powell\r\nattacked this in his _Observations on the First Chapter of a Book called\r\nMiscellanea_ (1760). This attack was probably in the interest of another\r\ncandidate, a man of his own college (St. John's), William Ludlam.\r\n\r\n[490] William Paley (1743-1805) was afterwards a tutor at Christ's College,\r\nCambridge. He never contributed anything to mathematics, but his _Evidences\r\nof Christianity_ (1794) was long considered somewhat of a classic. He also\r\nwrote _Principles of Morality and Politics_ (1785), and _Natural Theology_\r\n(1802).\r\n\r\n[491] Edward, first Baron Thurlow (1731-1806) is known to Americans because\r\nof his strong support of the Royal prerogative during the Revolution. He\r\nwas a favorite of George III, and became Lord Chancellor in 1778.\r\n\r\n[492] George Wilson Meadley (1774-1818) published his _Memoirs of ...\r\nPaley_ in 1809. He also published _Memoirs of Algernon Sidney_ in 1813. He\r\nwas a merchant and banker, and had traveled extensively in Europe and the\r\nEast. He was a convert to unitarianism, to which sect Paley had a strong\r\nleaning.\r\n\r\n[493] Watson (1737-1816) was a strange kind of man for a bishopric. He was\r\nprofessor of chemistry at Cambridge (1764) at the age of twenty-seven. It\r\nwas his experiments that led to the invention of the black-bulb\r\nthermometer. He is said to have saved the government L100,000 a year by his\r\nadvice on the manufacture of gunpowder. Even after he became professor of\r\ndivinity at Cambridge (1771) he published four volumes of _Chemical Essays_\r\n(vol. I, 1781). He became Bishop of Llandaff in 1782.\r\n\r\n[494] James Adair (died in 1798) was counsel for the defense in the trial\r\nof the publishers of the _Letters of Junius_ (1771). As King's Serjeant he\r\nassisted in prosecuting Hardy and Horne Tooke.\r\n\r\n[495] Morgan (1750-1833) was actuary of the Equitable Assurance Society of\r\nLondon (1774-1830), and it was to his great abilities that the success of\r\nthat company was due at a time when other corporations of similar kind were\r\nmeeting with disaster. The Royal Society awarded him a medal (1783) for a\r\npaper on _Probability of Survivorship_. He wrote several important works on\r\ninsurance and finance.\r\n\r\n[496] Dr. Price (1723-1791) was a non-conformist minister and a writer on\r\nethics, economics, politics, and insurance. He was a defender of the\r\nAmerican Revolution and a personal friend of Franklin. In 1778 Congress\r\ninvited him to America to assist in the financial administration of the new\r\nrepublic, but he declined. His famous sermon on the French Revolution is\r\nsaid to have inspired Burke's _Reflections on the Revolution in France_.\r\n\r\n[497] Elizabeth Gurney (1780-1845), a Quaker, who married Joseph Fry\r\n(1800), a London merchant. She was the prime mover in the Association for\r\nthe Improvement of the Female Prisoners in Newgate, founded in 1817. Her\r\ninfluence in prison reform extended throughout Europe, and she visited the\r\nprisons of many countries in her efforts to improve the conditions of penal\r\nservitude. The friendship of Mrs. Fry with the De Morgans began in 1837.\r\nHer scheme for a female benefit society proved worthless from the actuarial\r\nstandpoint, and would have been disastrous to all concerned if it had been\r\ncarried out, and it was therefore fortunate that De Morgan was consulted in\r\ntime. Mrs. De Morgan speaks of the consultation in these words: \"My\r\nhusband, who was very sensitive on such points, was charmed with Mrs. Fry's\r\nvoice and manner as much as by the simple self-forgetfulness with which she\r\nentered into this business; her own very uncomfortable share of it not\r\nbeing felt as an element in the question, as long as she could be useful in\r\npromoting good or preventing mischief. I can see her now as she came into\r\nour room, took off her little round Quaker cap, and laying it down, went at\r\nonce into the matter. 'I have followed thy advice, and I think nothing\r\nfurther can be done in this case; but all harm is prevented.' In the\r\nfollowing year I had an opportunity of seeing the effect of her most\r\nmusical tones. I visited her at Stratford, taking my little baby and nurse\r\nwith me, to consult her on some articles on prison discipline, which I had\r\nwritten for a periodical. The baby--three months old--was restless, and the\r\nnurse could not quiet her, neither could I entirely, until Mrs. Fry began\r\nto read something connected with the subject of my visit, when the infant,\r\nfixing her large eyes on the reader, lay listening till she fell asleep.\"\r\n_Memoirs_, p. 91.\r\n\r\n[498] Mrs. Fry certainly believed that the writer was the old actuary of\r\nthe Equitable, when she first consulted him upon the benevolent Assurance\r\nproject; but we were introduced to her by our old and dear friend Lady Noel\r\nByron, by whom she had been long known and venerated, and who referred her\r\nto Mr. De Morgan for advice. An unusual degree of confidence in, and\r\nappreciation of each other, arose on their first meeting between the two,\r\nwho had so much that was externally different, and so much that was\r\nessentially alike, in their natures.--S. E. De M.\r\n\r\nAnne Isabella Milbanke (1792-1860) married Lord Byron in 1815, when both\r\ntook the additional name of Noel, her mother's name. They were separated in\r\n1816.\r\n\r\n[499] An obscure writer not mentioned in the ordinary biographies.\r\n\r\n[500] Not mentioned in the ordinary biographies, and for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\n[501] \"Before\" and \"after.\"\r\n\r\n[502] On Bishop Wilkins see note 171 on page 100.\r\n\r\n[503] Provision for a journey.\r\n\r\n[504] See note 179 on page 103.\r\n\r\n[505] Thomas Bradwardine (1290-1349), known as _Doctor Profundus_, proctor\r\nand professor of theology at Oxford, and afterwards Chancellor of St.\r\nPaul's and confessor to Edward III. The English ascribed their success at\r\nCrecy to his prayers.\r\n\r\n[506] He was consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury by the Pope at Avignon,\r\nJuly 13, 1349, and died of the plague at London in the same year.\r\n\r\n[507] \"One paltry little year.\"\r\n\r\n[508] The title is carelessly copied, as is so frequently the case in\r\ncatalogues, even of the Libri class. It should read: _Arithmetica thome\r\nbrauardini_ || _Olivier Senant_ || _Venum exponuntur ab Oliuiario senant in\r\nvico diui Jacobi sub signo beate Barbare sedente_. The colophon reads:\r\n_Explicit arithmetica speculatiua th[=o]e brauardini b[=n] reuisa et\r\ncorrecta a Petro sanchez Ciruelo aragonensi mathematicas leg[=e]te\r\nParisius, [=i]pressa per Thom[=a] anguelart_. There were Paris editions of\r\n1495, 1496, 1498, s. a. (c. 1500), 1502, 1504, 1505, s. a. (c. 1510), 1512,\r\n1530, a Valencia edition of 1503, two Wittenberg editions of 1534 and 1536,\r\nand doubtless several others. The work is not \"very rare,\" although of\r\ncourse no works of that period are common. See the editor's _Rara\r\nArithmetica_, page 61.\r\n\r\n[509] This is his _Tractatus de proportionibus_, Paris, 1495; Venice, 1505;\r\nVienna, 1515, with other editions.\r\n\r\n[510] The colophon of the 1495 edition reads: _Et sic explicit Geometria\r\nThome brauardini c[=u] tractatulo de quadratura circuli bene reuisa a Petro\r\nsanchez ciruelo: operaqz Guidonis mercatoris dilig[=e]tissime impresse\r\nparisi^o in c[=a]po gaillardi.

He\r\nstudied mathematics and philosophy at Paris, and took the doctor's degree\r\nthere. He taught at the University of Alcala and became canon of the\r\nCathedral at Salamanca. Besides his editions of Bradwardine he wrote\r\nseveral works, among them the _Liber arithmeticae practicae qui dicitur\r\nalgorithmus_ (Paris, 1495) and the _Cursus quatuor mathematicarum artium\r\nliberalium_ (Alcala, 1516).\r\n\r\n[511] Star polygons, a subject of considerable study in the later Middle\r\nAges. See note 35 on page 44.\r\n\r\n[512] \"A new theory that adds lustre to the fourteenth century.\"\r\n\r\n[513] There is nothing in the edition of 1495 that leads to this\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\n[514] The full title is: _Nouvelle theorie des paralleles, avec un\r\nappendice contenant la maniere de perfectionner la theorie des paralleles\r\nde A. M. Legendre_. The author had no standing as a scientist.\r\n\r\n[515] Adrien Marie Legendre (1752-1833) was one of the great mathematicians\r\nof the opening of the nineteenth century. His _Elements de geometrie_\r\n(1794) had great influence on the geometry of the United States. His _Essai\r\nsur la theorie des nombres_ (1798) is one of the classics upon the subject.\r\nThe work to which Kircher refers is the _Nouvelle theorie des paralleles_\r\n(1803), in which the attempt is made to avoid using Euclid's postulate of\r\nparallels, the result being merely the substitution of another assumption\r\nthat was even more unsatisfactory. The best presentations of the general\r\ntheory are W. B. Frankland's _Theories of Parallelism_, Cambridge, 1910,\r\nand Engel and Staeckel's _Die Theorie der Parallellinien von Euclid bis auf\r\nGauss_, Leipsic, 1895. Legendre published a second work on the theory the\r\nyear of his death, _Reflexions sur ... la theorie des paralleles_ (1833).\r\nHis other works include the _Nouvelles methodes pour la determination des\r\norbites des cometes_ (1805), in which he uses the method of least squares;\r\nthe _Traite des fonctions elliptiques et des integrales_ (1827-1832), and\r\nthe _Exercises de calcul integral_ (1811, 1816, 1817).\r\n\r\n[516] Johann Joseph Ignatz von Hoffmann (1777-1866), professor of\r\nmathematics at Aschaffenburg, published his _Theorie der Parallellinien_ in\r\n1801. He supplemented this by his _Kritik der Parallelen-Theorie_ in 1807,\r\nand his _Das eilfte Axiom der Elemente des Euclidis neu bewiesen_ in 1859.\r\nHe wrote other works on mathematics, but none of his contributions was of\r\nany importance.\r\n\r\n[517] Johann Karl Friedrich Hauff (1766-1846) was successively professor of\r\nmathematics at Marburg, director of the polytechnic school at Augsburg,\r\nprofessor at the Gymnasium at Cologne, and professor of mathematics and\r\nphysics at Ghent. The work to which Kircher refers is his memoirs on the\r\nEuclidean _Theorie der Parallelen_ in Hindenburg's _Archiv_, vol. III\r\n(1799), an article of no merit in the general theory.\r\n\r\n[518] Wenceslaus Johann Gustav Karsten (1732-1787) was professor of logic\r\nat Rostock (1758) and Butzow (1760), and later became professor of\r\nmathematics and physics at Halle. His work on parallels is the _Versuch\r\neiner voellig berichtigten Theorie der Parallellinien_ (1779). He also wrote\r\na work entitled _Anfangsgruende der mathematischen Wissenschaften_ (1780),\r\nbut neither of these works was more than mediocre.\r\n\r\n[519] Johann Christoph Schwab (not Schwal) was born in 1743 and died in\r\n1821. He was professor at the Karlsschule at Stuttgart. De Morgan's wish\r\nwas met, for the catalogues give \"c. fig. 8,\" so that it evidently had\r\neight illustrations instead of eight volumes. He wrote several other works\r\non the principles of geometry, none of any importance.\r\n\r\n[520] Gaetano Rossi of Catanzaro. This was the libretto writer (1772-1855),\r\nand hence the imperfections of the work can better be condoned. De Morgan\r\nshould have given a little more of the title: _Solusione esatta e regolare\r\n... del ... problema della quadratura del circolo_. There was a second\r\nedition, London, 1805.\r\n\r\n[521] This identifies Rossi, for Josephine Grassini (1773-1850) was a\r\nwell-known contralto, _prima donna_ at Napoleon's court opera.\r\n\r\n[522] William Spence (1783-1860) was an entomologist and economist of some\r\nstanding, a fellow of the Royal Society, and one of the founders of the\r\nEntomological Society of London. The work here mentioned was a popular one,\r\nthe first edition appearing in 1807, and four editions being justified in a\r\nsingle year. He also wrote _Agriculture the Source of Britain's Wealth_\r\n(1808) and _Objections against the Corn Bill refuted_ (1815), besides a\r\nwork in four volumes on entomology (1815-1826) in collaboration with\r\nWilliam Kirby.\r\n\r\n[523] \"That used to be so, but we have changed all that.\"\r\n\r\n[524] \"Meet the coming disease.\"\r\n\r\n[525] George Douglas (or Douglass) was a Scotch writer. He got out an\r\nedition of the _Elements of Euclid_ in 1776, with an appendix on\r\ntrigonometry and a set of tables. His work on _Mathematical Tables_\r\nappeared in 1809, and his _Art of Drawing in Perspective, from mathematical\r\nprinciples_, in 1810.\r\n\r\n[526] See note 443, on page 197.\r\n\r\n[527] John Playfair (1748-1848) was professor of mathematics (1785) and\r\nnatural philosophy (1805) at the University of Edinburgh. His _Elements of\r\nGeometry_ went through many editions.\r\n\r\n[528] \"Tell Apella\" was an expression current in classical Rome to indicate\r\nincredulity and to show the contempt in which the Jew was held. Horace\r\nsays: _Credat Judaeus Apella_, \"Let Apella the Jew believe it.\" Our \"Tell it\r\nto the marines,\" is a similar phrase.\r\n\r\n[529] As De Morgan says two lines later, \"No mistake is more common than\r\nthe natural one of imagining that the\"--University of Virginia is at\r\nRichmond. The fact is that it is not there, and that it did not exist in\r\n1810. It was not chartered until 1819, and was not opened until 1825, and\r\nthen at Charlottesville. The act establishing the Central College, from\r\nwhich the University of Virginia developed, was passed in 1816. The Jean\r\nWood to whom De Morgan refers was one John Wood who was born about 1775 in\r\nScotland and who emigrated to the United States in 1800. He published a\r\n_History of the Administration of J. Adams_ (New York, 1802) that was\r\nsuppressed by Aaron Burr. This act called forth two works, a _Narrative of\r\nthe Suppression, by Col. Burr, of the 'History of the Administration of\r\nJohn Adams'_ (1802), in which Wood was sustained; and the _Antidote to John\r\nWood's Poison_ (1802), in which he was attacked. The work referred to in\r\nthe \"printed circular\" may have been the _New theory of the diurnal\r\nrotation of the earth_ (Richmond, Va., 1809). Wood spent the last years of\r\nhis life in Richmond, Va., making county maps. He died there in 1822. A\r\ncareful search through works relating to the University of Virginia fails\r\nto show that Wood had any connection with it.\r\n\r\n[530] There seems to be nothing to add to Dobson's biography beyond what De\r\nMorgan has so deliciously set forth.\r\n\r\n[531] \"Give to each man his due.\"\r\n\r\n[532] Hester Lynch Salusbury (1741-1821), the friend of Dr. Johnson,\r\nmarried Henry Thrale (1763), a brewer, who died in 1781. She then married\r\nGabriel Piozzi (1784), an Italian musician. Her _Anecdotes of the late\r\nSamuel Johnson_ (1786) and _Letters to and from Samuel Johnson_ (1788) are\r\nwell known. She also wrote numerous essays and poems.\r\n\r\n[533] Samuel Pike (c. 1717-1773) was an independent minister, with a chapel\r\nin London and a theological school in his house. He later became a disciple\r\nof Robert Sandeman and left the Independents for the Sandemanian church\r\n(1765). The _Philosophia Sacra_ was first published at London in 1753. De\r\nMorgan here cites the second edition.\r\n\r\n[534] Pike had been dead over forty years when Kittle published this second\r\nedition. Kittle had already published a couple of works: _King Solomon's\r\nportraiture of Old Age_ (Edinburgh, 1813), and _Critical and Practical\r\nLectures on the Apocalyptical Epistles to the Seven Churches of Asia Minor_\r\n(London, 1814).\r\n\r\n[535] See note 334, on page 152.\r\n\r\n[536] William Stukely (1687-1765) was a fellow of the Royal Society and of\r\nthe College of Physicians and Surgeons. He afterwards (1729) entered the\r\nChurch. He was prominent as an antiquary, especially in the study of the\r\nRoman and Druidic remains of Great Britain. He was the author of numerous\r\nworks, chiefly on paleography.\r\n\r\n[537] William Jones (1726-1800), who should not be confused with his\r\nnamesake who is mentioned in note 281 on page 135. He was a lifelong friend\r\nof Bishop Horne, and his vicarage at Nayland was a meeting place of an\r\ninfluential group of High Churchmen. Besides the _Physiological\r\nDisquisitions_ (1781) he wrote _The Catholic Doctrine of the Trinity_\r\n(1756) and _The Grand Analogy_ (1793).\r\n\r\n[538] Robert Spearman (1703-1761) was a pupil of John Hutchinson, and not\r\nonly edited his works but wrote his life. He wrote a work against the\r\nNewtonian physics, entitled _An Enquiry after Philosophy and Theology_\r\n(Edinburgh, 1755), besides the _Letters to a Friend concerning the\r\nSeptuagint Translation_ (Edinburgh, 1759) to which De Morgan refers.\r\n\r\n[539] A writer of no importance, at least in the minds of British\r\nbiographers.\r\n\r\n[540] Alexander Catcott (1725-1779), a theologian and geologist, wrote not\r\nonly a work on the creation (1756) but a _Treatise on the Deluge_ (1761,\r\nwith a second edition in 1768). Sir Charles Lyell considered the latter\r\nwork a valuable contribution to geology.\r\n\r\n[541] James Robertson (1714-1795), professor of Hebrew at the University of\r\nEdinburgh. Probably De Morgan refers to his _Grammatica Linguae Hebraeae_\r\n(Edinburgh, 1758; with a second edition in 1783). He also wrote _Clavis\r\nPentateuchi_ (1770).\r\n\r\n[542] Benjamin Holloway (c. 1691-1759), a geologist and theologian. He\r\ntranslated Woodward's _Naturalis Historia Telluris_, and was introduced by\r\nWoodward to Hutchinson. The work referred to by De Morgan appeared at\r\nOxford in two volumes in 1754.\r\n\r\n[543] His work was _The Christian plan exhibited in the interpretation of\r\nElohim: with observations upon a few other matters relative to the same\r\nsubject_, Oxford, 1752, with a second edition in 1755.\r\n\r\n[544] Duncan Forbes (1685-1747) studied Oriental languages and Civil law at\r\nLeyden. He was Lord President of the Court of Sessions (1737). He wrote a\r\nnumber of theological works.\r\n\r\n[545] Should be 1756.\r\n\r\n[546] Edward Henry Bickersteth (1825-1906), bishop of Exeter (1885-1900);\r\npublished _The Rock of Ages; or scripture testimony to the one Eternal\r\nGodhead of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost_ at Hampstead\r\nin 1859. A second edition appeared at London in 1860.\r\n\r\n[547] Thomas Sadler (1822-1891) took his Ph.D. at Erlangen in 1844, and\r\nbecame a Unitarian minister at Hampstead, where Bickersteth's work was\r\npublished. Besides writing the _Gloria Patri_ (1859), he edited Crabb\r\nRobinson's Diaries.\r\n\r\n[548] This was his _Virgil's Bucolics and the two first Satyrs of Juvenal_,\r\n1634.\r\n\r\n[549] Possibly in his _Twelve Questions or Arguments drawn out of\r\nScripture, wherein the commonly received Opinion touching the Deity of the\r\nHoly Spirit is clearly and fully refuted_, 1647. This was his first\r\nheretical work, and it was followed by a number of others that were written\r\nduring the intervals in which the Puritan parliament allowed him out of\r\nprison. It was burned by the hangman as blasphemous. Biddle finally died in\r\nprison, unrepentant to the last.\r\n\r\n[550] The first edition of the anonymous [Greek: Haireseon anastasis] (by\r\nVicars?) appeared in 1805.\r\n\r\n[551] Possibly by Thomas Pearne (c. 1753-1827), a fellow of St. Peter's\r\nCollege, Cambridge, and a Unitarian minister.\r\n\r\n[552] Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford, was borne in London in 1593, and\r\nwas executed there in 1641. He was privy councilor to Charles I, and was\r\nLord Deputy of Ireland. On account of his repressive measures to uphold the\r\nabsolute power of the king he was impeached by the Long Parliament and was\r\nexecuted for treason. The essence of his defence is in the sentence quoted\r\nby De Morgan, to which Pym replied that taken as a whole, the acts tended\r\nto show an intention to change the government, and this was in itself\r\ntreason.\r\n\r\n[553] The name assumed by a writer who professed to give a mathematical\r\nexplanation of the Trinity, see farther on.--S. E. De M.\r\n\r\n[554] Sabellius (fl. 230 A.D.) was an early Christian of Libyan origin. He\r\ntaught that Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were different names for the same\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n[555] Sir Richard Phillips was born in London in 1767 (not 1768 as stated\r\nabove), and died there in 1840. He was a bookseller and printer in\r\nLeicester, where he also edited a radical newspaper. He went to London to\r\nlive in 1795 and started the _Monthly Magazine_ there in 1796. Besides the\r\nworks mentioned by De Morgan he wrote on law and economics.\r\n\r\n[556] It was really eighteen months.\r\n\r\n[557] While he was made sheriff in 1807 he was not knighted until the\r\nfollowing year.\r\n\r\n[558] James Mitchell (c. 1786-1844) was a London actuary, or rather a\r\nScotch actuary living a good part of his life in London. Besides the work\r\nmentioned he compiled a _Dictionary of Chemistry, Mineralogy, and Geology_\r\n(1823), and wrote _On the Plurality of Worlds_ (1813) and _The Elements of\r\nAstronomy_ (1820).\r\n\r\n[559] Richarda Smith, wife of Sir George Biddell Airy (see note 129, page\r\n85) the astronomer. In 1835 Sir Robert Peel offered a pension of L300 a\r\nyear to Airy, who requested that it be settled on his wife.\r\n\r\n[560] Mary Fairfax (1780-1872) married as her second husband Dr. William\r\nSomerville. In 1826 she presented to the Royal Society a paper on _The\r\nMagnetic Properties of the Violet Rays of the Solar Spectrum_, which\r\nattracted much attention. It was for her _Mechanism of the Heavens_ (1831),\r\na popular translation of Laplace's _Mecanique Celeste_, that she was\r\npensioned.\r\n\r\n[561] Dominique Francois Jean Arago (1786-1853) the celebrated French\r\nastronomer and physicist.\r\n\r\n[562] For there is a well-known series\r\n\r\n  1 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^2 + ... = [pi]^2/6.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, the given series equals 1, we have\r\n\r\n  2 = 1/6 [pi]^2\r\n\r\n  or [pi]^2 = 12,\r\n\r\n  whence [pi] = 2 [root]3.\r\n\r\nBut c = [pi]d, and twice the diagonal of a cube on the diameter is 2d\r\n[root]3.\r\n\r\n[563] There was a second edition in 1821.\r\n\r\n[564] London, 1830.\r\n\r\n[565] He was a resident of Chatham, and seems to have published no other\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n[566] Richard Whately (1787-1863) was, as a child, a calculating prodigy\r\n(see note 132, page 86), but lost the power as is usually the case with\r\nwell-balanced minds. He was a fellow of Oriel College, Oxford, and in 1825\r\nbecame principal of St. Alban Hall. He was a friend of Newman, Keble, and\r\nothers who were interested in the religious questions of the day. He became\r\narchbishop of Dublin in 1831. He was for a long time known to students\r\nthrough his _Logic_ (1826) and _Rhetoric_ (1828).\r\n\r\n[567] William King, D.C.L. (1663-1712), student at Christ Church, Oxford,\r\nand celebrated as a wit and scholar. His _Dialogues of the Dead_ (1699) is\r\na satirical attack on Bentley.\r\n\r\n[568] Thomas Ebrington (1760-1835) was a fellow of Trinity College, Dublin,\r\nand taught divinity, mathematics, and natural philosophy there. He became\r\nprovost of the college in 1811, bishop of Limerick in 1820, and bishop of\r\nLeighlin and Ferns in 1822. His edition of Euclid was reprinted a dozen\r\ntimes. The _Reply to John Search's Considerations on the Law of Libel_\r\nappeared at Dublin in 1834.\r\n\r\n[569] Joseph Blanco White (1775-1841) was the son of an Irishman living in\r\nSpain. He was born at Seville and studied for orders there, being ordained\r\npriest in 1800. He lost his faith in the Roman Catholic Church, and gave up\r\nthe ministry, escaping to England at the time of the French invasion. At\r\nLondon he edited _Espanol_, a patriotic journal extensively circulated in\r\nSpain, and for this service he was pensioned after the expulsion of the\r\nFrench. He then studied at Oriel College, Oxford, and became intimate with\r\nmen like Whately, Newman, and Keble. In 1835 he became a Unitarian. Among\r\nhis theological writings is his _Evidences against Catholicism_ (1825). The\r\n\"rejoinder\" to which De Morgan refers consisted of two letters: _The law of\r\nanti-religious Libel reconsidered_ (Dublin, 1834) and _An Answer to some\r\nFriendly Remarks on \"The Law of Anti-Religious Libel Reconsidered\"_\r\n(Dublin, 1834).\r\n\r\n[570] The work was translated from the French.\r\n\r\n[571] J. Hoene Wronski (1778-1853) served, while yet a mere boy, as an\r\nartillery officer in Kosciusko's army (1791-1794). He was imprisoned after\r\nthe battle of Maciejowice. He afterwards lived in Germany, and (after 1810)\r\nin Paris. For the bibliography of his works see S. Dickstein's article in\r\nthe _Bibliotheca Mathematica_, vol. VI (2), page 48.\r\n\r\n[572] Perhaps referring to his _Introduction a la philosophie des\r\nmathematiques_ (1811).\r\n\r\n[573] Read \"equation of the.\"\r\n\r\n[574] Thomas Young (1773-1829), physician and physicist, sometimes called\r\nthe founder of physiological optics. He seems to have initiated the theory\r\nof color blindness that was later developed by Helmholtz. The attack\r\nreferred to was because of his connection with the Board of Longitude, he\r\nhaving been made (1818) superintendent of the Nautical Almanac and\r\nsecretary of the Board. He opposed introducing into the Nautical Almanac\r\nanything not immediately useful to navigation, and this antagonized many\r\nscientists.\r\n\r\n[575] Isaac Milner (1750-1820) was professor of natural philosophy at\r\nCambridge (1783) and later became, as De Morgan states, president of\r\nQueens' College (1788). In 1791 he became dean of Carlisle, and in 1798\r\nLucasian professor of mathematics. His chief interest was in chemistry and\r\nphysics, but he contributed nothing of importance to these sciences or to\r\nmathematics.\r\n\r\n[576] Thomas Perronet Thompson (1783-1869), fellow of Queens' College,\r\nCambridge, saw service in Spain and India, but after 1822 lived in England.\r\nHe became major general in 1854, and general in 1868. Besides some works on\r\neconomics and politics he wrote a _Geometry without Axioms_ (1830) that De\r\nMorgan includes later on in his _Budget_. In it Thompson endeavored to\r\nprove the parallel postulate.\r\n\r\n[577] De Morgan's father-in-law. See note 441, page 196.\r\n\r\n[578] Johann Friedrich Herbart (1776-1841), successor of Kant as professor\r\nof philosophy at Koenigsberg (1809-1833), where he established a school of\r\npedagogy. From 1833 until his death he was professor of philosophy at\r\nGoettingen. The title of the pamphlet is: _De Attentionis mensura causisque\r\nprimariis. Psychologiae principia statica et mechanica exemplo\r\nillustraturus.... Regiomonti,... 1822_. The formulas in question are given\r\non pages 15 and 17, and De Morgan has omitted the preliminary steps, which\r\nare, for the first one:\r\n\r\n  [beta] ([phi] - z) [delta]t = [delta]z\r\n\r\n  unde [beta]t= Const / ([phi] - z).\r\n\r\n  Pro t = 0 etiam z = 0; hinc [beta]t = log [phi]/([phi] - z).\r\n\r\n  z = [phi] (1 - [epsilon]^{-[beta]t});\r\n\r\n  et   [delta]z/[delta]t = [beta][phi][epsilon]^{-[beta]t}\r\n\r\nThese are, however, quite elementary as compared with other portions of the\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\n[579] See note 371, page 168.\r\n\r\n[580] William Law (1686-1761) was a clergyman, a fellow of Emanuel College,\r\nCambridge, and in later life a convert to Behmen's philosophy. He was so\r\nfree in his charities that the village in which he lived became so infested\r\nby beggars that he was urged by the citizens to leave. He wrote _A serious\r\ncall to a devout and holy life_ (1728).\r\n\r\n[581] He was a curate at Cheshunt, and wrote the _Spiritual voice to the\r\nChristian Church and to the Jews_ (London, 1760), _A second warning to the\r\nworld by the Spirit of Prophecy_ (London, 1760), and _Signs of the Times;\r\nor a Voice to Babylon_ (London, 1773).\r\n\r\n[582] His real name was Thomas Vaughan (1622-1666). He was a fellow of\r\nJesus College, Oxford, taking orders, but was deprived of his living on\r\naccount of drunkenness. He became a mystic philosopher and gave attention\r\nto alchemy. His works had a large circulation, particularly on the\r\ncontinent. He wrote _Magia Adamica_ (London, 1650), _Euphrates; or the\r\nWaters of the East_ (London, 1655), and _The Chymist's key to shut, and to\r\nopen; or the True Doctrine of Corruption and Generation_ (London, 1657).\r\n\r\n[583] Emanuel Swedenborg, or Svedberg (1688-1772) the mystic. It is not\r\ncommonly known to mathematicians that he was one of their guild, but he\r\nwrote on both mathematics and chemistry. Among his works are the\r\n_Regelkonst eller algebra_ (Upsala, 1718) and the _Methodus nova inveniendi\r\nlongitudines locorum, terra marique, ope lunae_ (Amsterdam, 1721, 1727, and\r\n1766). After 1747 he devoted his attention to mystic philosophy.\r\n\r\n[584] Pierre Simon Laplace (1749-1827), whose _Exposition du systeme du\r\nmonde_ (1796) and _Traite de mecanique celeste_ (1799) are well known.\r\n\r\n[585] See note 117, page 76.\r\n\r\n[586] John Dalton (1766-1844), who taught mathematics and physics at New\r\nCollege, Manchester (1793-1799) and was the first to state the law of the\r\nexpansion of gases known by his name and that of Gay-Lussac. His _New\r\nsystem of Chemical Philosophy_ (Vol. I, pt. i, 1808; pt. ii, 1810; vol. II,\r\n1827) sets forth his atomic theory.\r\n\r\n[587] Howison was a poet and philosopher. He lived in Edinburgh and was a\r\nfriend of Sir Walter Scott. This work appeared in 1822.\r\n\r\n[588] He was a shoemaker, born about 1765 at Haddiscoe, and his\r\n\"astro-historical\" lectures at Norwich attracted a good deal of attention\r\nat one time. He traced all geologic changes to differences in the\r\ninclination of the earth's axis to the plane of its orbit. Of the works\r\nmentioned by De Morgan the first appeared at Norwich in 1822-1823, and\r\nthere was a second edition in 1824. The second appeared in 1824-1825. The\r\nfourth was _Urania's Key to the Revelation; or the analyzation of the\r\nwritings of the Jews..._, and was first published at Norwich in 1823, there\r\nbeing a second edition at London in 1833. His books were evidently not a\r\nfinancial success, for Mackey died in an almshouse at Norwich.\r\n\r\n[589] Godfrey Higgins (1773-1833), the archeologist, was interested in the\r\nhistory of religious beliefs and in practical sociology. He wrote _Horae\r\nSabbaticae_ (1826), _The Celtic Druids_ (1827 and 1829), and _Anacalypsis,\r\nan attempt to draw aside the veil of the Saitic Isis; or an Inquiry into\r\nthe Origin of Languages, Nations, and Religions_ (posthumously published,\r\n1836), and other works. See also page 274, _infra_.\r\n\r\n[590] The work also appeared in French. Wirgman wrote, or at least began,\r\ntwo other works: _Divarication of the New Testament into Doctrine and\r\nHistory; part I, The Four Gospels_ (London, 1830), and _Mental Philosophy;\r\npart I, Grammar of the five senses; being the first step to infant\r\neducation_ (London, 1838).\r\n\r\n[591] He was born at Shandrum, County Limerick, and supported himself by\r\nteaching writing and arithmetic. He died in an almshouse at Cork.\r\n\r\n[592] George Boole (1815-1864), professor of mathematics at Queens'\r\nCollege, Cork. His _Laws of Thought_ (1854) was the first work on the\r\nalgebra of logic.\r\n\r\n[593] Oratio Grassi (1582-1654), the Jesuit who became famous for his\r\ncontroversy with Galileo over the theory of comets. Galileo ridiculed him\r\nin _Il Saggiatore_, although according to the modern view Grassi was the\r\nmore nearly right. It is said that the latter's resentment led to the\r\npersecution of Galileo.\r\n\r\n[594] De Morgan might have found much else for his satire in the letters of\r\nWalsh. He sought, in his _Theory of Partial Functions_, to substitute\r\n\"partial equations\" for the differential calculus. In his diary there is an\r\nentry: \"Discovered the general solution of numerical equations of the fifth\r\ndegree at 114 Evergreen Street, at the Cross of Evergreen, Cork, at nine\r\no'clock in the forenoon of July 7th, 1844; exactly twenty-two years after\r\nthe invention of the Geometry of Partial Equations, and the expulsion of\r\nthe differential calculus from Mathematical Science.\"\r\n\r\n[595] \"It has been ordered, sir, it has been ordered.\"\r\n\r\n[596] Bartholomew Prescot was a Liverpool accountant. De Morgan gives this\r\ncorrect spelling on page 278. He died after 1849. His _Inverted Scheme of\r\nCopernicus_ appeared in Liverpool in 1822.\r\n\r\n[597] Robert Taylor (1784-1844) had many more ups and downs than De Morgan\r\nmentions. He was a priest of the Church of England, but resigned his parish\r\nin 1818 after preaching against Christianity. He soon recanted and took\r\nanother parish, but was dismissed by the Bishop almost immediately on the\r\nground of heresy. As stated in the text, he was convicted of blasphemy in\r\n1827 and was sentenced to a year's imprisonment, and again for two years on\r\nthe same charge in 1831. He then married a woman who was rich in money and\r\nin years, and was thereupon sued for breach of promise by another woman. To\r\nescape paying the judgment that was rendered against him he fled to Tours\r\nwhere he took up surgery.\r\n\r\n[598] Herbert Marsh, Bishop of Peterborough. See note 449 on page 199.\r\n\r\n[599] \"Argument from the prison.\"\r\n\r\n[600] Richard Carlile (1790-1843), one of the leading radicals of his time.\r\nHe published Hone's parodies (see note 250, page 124) after they had been\r\nsuppressed, and an edition of Thomas Paine (1818). He was repeatedly\r\nimprisoned, serving nine years in all. His continued conflict with the\r\nauthorities proved a good advertisement for his bookshop.\r\n\r\n[601] Wilhelm Ludwig Christmann (1780-1835) was a protestant clergyman and\r\nteacher of mathematics. For a while he taught under Pestalozzi.\r\nDisappointed in his ambition to be professor of mathematics at Tubingen, he\r\nbecame a confirmed misanthrope and is said never to have left his house\r\nduring the last ten years of his life. He wrote several works: _Ein Wort\r\nueber Pestalozzi und Pestalozzismus_ (1812); _Ars cossae promota_ (1814);\r\n_Philosophia cossica_ (1815); _Aetas argentea cossae_ (1819); _Ueber\r\nTradition und Schrift, Logos und Kabbala_ (1829), besides the one mentioned\r\nabove. The word _coss_ in the above titles was a German name for algebra,\r\nfrom the Italian _cosa_ (thing), the name for the unknown quantity. It\r\nappears in English in the early name for algebra, \"the cossic art.\"\r\n\r\n[602] See note 174, page 101.\r\n\r\n[603] See note 589, page 257.\r\n\r\n[604] He seems to have written nothing else.\r\n\r\n[605] See note 596 on page 270. The name is here spelled correctly.\r\n\r\n[606] Joseph Jacotot (1770-1840), the father of this Fortune Jacotot, was\r\nan infant prodigy. At nineteen he was made professor of the humanities at\r\nDijon. He served in the army, and then became professor of mathematics at\r\nDijon. He continued in his chair until the restoration of the Bourbons, and\r\nthen fled to Louvain. It was here that he developed the method with which\r\nhis name is usually connected. He wrote a _Mathematiques_ in 1827, which\r\nwent through four editions. The _Epitome_ is by his son, Fortune.\r\n\r\n[607] He wrote on educational topics and a _Sacred History_ that went\r\nthrough several editions.\r\n\r\n[608] \"All is in all.\"\r\n\r\n[609] \"Know one thing and refer everything else to it,\" as it is often\r\ntranslated.\r\n\r\n[610] A writer of no reputation.\r\n\r\n[611] Sir John Lubbock (1803-1865), banker, scientist, publicist,\r\nastronomer, one of the versatile men of his time.\r\n\r\n[612] See note 165, page 99.\r\n\r\n[613] \"Those about to die salute you.\"\r\n\r\n[614] Georges Louis Leclerc Buffon (1707-1788), the well-known biologist.\r\nHe also experimented with burning mirrors, his results appearing in his\r\n_Invention des miroirs ardens pour bruler a une grande distance_ (1747).\r\nThe reference here may be to his _Resolution des problemes qui regardent le\r\njeu du franc carreau_ (1733). The prominence of his _Histoire naturelle_\r\n(36 volumes, 1749-1788) has overshadowed the credit due to him for his\r\ntranslation of Newton's work on Fluxions.\r\n\r\n[615] See page 285.

He wrote _A Treatise on the Valuation of Annuities and Assurances\r\non Lives and Survivorships; on the Construction of tables of mortality; and\r\non the Probabilities and Expectations of Life_, London, 1815. Upon the\r\nbasis of the Carlisle bills of mortality of Dr. Heysham he reconstructed\r\nthe mortality tables then in use and which were based upon the Northampton\r\ntable of Dr. Price. His work revolutionized the actuarial science of the\r\ntime. In later years he devoted his attention to natural history.\r\n\r\n[619] See note 576, page 252. He also wrote the _Theory of Parallels. The\r\nproof of Euclid's axiom looked for in the properties of the equiangular\r\nspiral_ (London, 1840), which went through four editions, and the _Theory\r\nof Parallels. The proof that the three angles of a triangle are equal to\r\ntwo right angles looked for in the inflation of the sphere_ (London, 1853),\r\nof which there were three editions.\r\n\r\n[620] For the latest summary, see W.

Although born in Turin\r\nand spending twenty of his best years in Germany, he is commonly looked\r\nupon as the great leader of French mathematicians. The last twenty-seven\r\nyears of his life were spent in Paris, and his remarkable productivity\r\ncontinued to the time of his death. His genius in the theory of numbers was\r\nprobably never excelled except by Fermat. He received very high honors at\r\nthe hands of Napoleon and was on the first staff of the Ecole polytechnique\r\n(1797).\r\n\r\n[622] \"I shall have to think it over again.\"\r\n\r\n[623] Henry Goulburn (1784-1856) held various government posts. He was\r\nunder-secretary for war and the colonies (1813), commissioner to negotiate\r\npeace with America (1814), chief secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of\r\nIreland (1821), and several times Chancellor of the Exchequer. On the\r\noccasion mentioned by De Morgan he was standing for parliament, and was\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n[624] On Drinkwater Bethune see note 165, page 99.\r\n\r\n[625] Charles Henry Cooper (1808-1866) was a biographer and antiquary. He\r\nwas town clerk of Cambridge (1849-1866) and wrote the _Annals of Cambridge_\r\n(1842-1853). His _Memorials of Cambridge_ (1874) appeared after his death.\r\nThompson Cooper was his son, and the two collaborated in the _Athenae\r\nCantabrigiensis_ (1858).\r\n\r\n[626] William Yates Peel (1789-1858) was a brother of Sir Robert Peel, he\r\nwhose name degenerated into the familiar title of the London \"Bobby\" or\r\n\"Peeler.\" Yates Peel was a member of parliament almost continuously from\r\n1817 to 1852. He represented Cambridge at Westminster from 1831 to 1835.\r\n\r\n[627] Henry John Temple, third Viscount of Palmerston (1784-1865), was\r\nmember for Cambridge in 1811, 1818, 1820, 1826 (defeating Goulburn), and\r\n1830. He failed of reelection in 1831 because of his advocacy of reform.\r\nThis must have been the time when Goulburn defeated him. He was Foreign\r\nSecretary (1827) and Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (1830-1841, and\r\n1846-1851). It is said of him that he \"created Belgium, saved Portugal and\r\nSpain from absolutism, rescued Turkey from Russia and the highway to India\r\nfrom France.\" He was Prime Minister almost continuously from 1855 to 1865,\r\na period covering the Indian Mutiny and the American Civil War.\r\n\r\n[628] William Cavendish, seventh Duke of Devonshire (1808-1891). He was\r\nmember for Cambridge from 1829 to 1831, but was defeated in 1831 because he\r\nhad favored parliamentary reform. He became Earl of Burlington in 1834, and\r\nDuke of Devonshire in 1858. He was much interested in the promotion of\r\nrailroads and in the iron and steel industries.\r\n\r\n[629] Richard Sheepshanks (1794-1855) was a brother of John Sheepshanks the\r\nbenefactor of art. (See note 314, p. 147.) He was a fellow of Trinity\r\nCollege, Cambridge, a fellow of the Royal Society and secretary of the\r\nAstronomical Society. Babbage (See note 469, p. 207) suspected him of\r\nadvising against the government support of his calculating machine and\r\nattacked him severely in his _Exposition of 1851_, in the chapter on _The\r\nIntrigues of Science_. Babbage also showed that Sheepshanks got an\r\nastronomical instrument of French make through the custom house by having\r\nTroughton's (See note 332, page 152) name engraved on it. Sheepshanks\r\nadmitted this second charge, but wrote a _Letter in Reply to the Calumnies\r\nof Mr. Babbage_, which was published in 1854. He had a highly controversial\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n[630] See note 469, page 207. The work referred to is _Passages from the\r\nLife of a Philosopher_, London, 1864.\r\n\r\n[631] Drinkwater Bethune. See note 165, page 99.\r\n\r\n[632] Simeon-Denis Poisson (1781-1840) was professor of calculus and\r\nmechanics at the Ecole polytechnique. He was made a baron by Napoleon, and\r\nwas raised to the peerage in 1837. His chief works are the _Traite de\r\nmecanique_ (1811) and the _Traite mathematique de la chaleur_ (1835).\r\n\r\n[633] \"As to M. Poisson, I really wish I had a thousandth part of his\r\nmathematical knowledge that I might prove my system to the incredulous.\"\r\n\r\n[634] This list includes most of the works of Antoine-Louis-Guenard\r\nDemonville. There was also the _Nouveau systeme du monde ... et hypotheses\r\nconformes aux experiences sur les vents, sur la lumiere et sur le fluide\r\nelectro-magnetique_, Paris, 1830.\r\n\r\n[635] Paris, 1835.\r\n\r\n[636] Paris, 1833.\r\n\r\n[637] The second part appeared in 1837. There were also editions in 1850\r\nand 1852, and one edition appeared without date.\r\n\r\n[638] Paris, 1842.\r\n\r\n[639] Parsey also wrote _The Art of Miniature Painting on Ivory_ (1831),\r\n_Perspective Rectified_ (1836), and _The Science of Vision_ (1840), the\r\nthird being a revision of the second.\r\n\r\n[640] William Ritchie (1790-1837) was a physicist who had studied at Paris\r\nunder Biot and Gay-Lussac. He contributed several papers on electricity,\r\nheat, and elasticity, and was looked upon as a good experimenter. Besides\r\nthe geometry he wrote the _Principles of the Differential and Integral\r\nCalculus_ (1836).\r\n\r\n[641] Alfred Day (1810-1849) was a man who was about fifty years ahead of\r\nhis time in his attempt to get at the logical foundations of geometry. It\r\nis true that he laid himself open to criticism, but his work was by no\r\nmeans bad. He also wrote _A Treatise on Harmony_ (1849, second edition\r\n1885), _The Rotation of the Pendulum_ (1851), and several works on Greek\r\nand Latin Grammar.\r\n\r\n[642] Walter Forman wrote a number of controversial tracts. His first seems\r\nto have been _A plan for improving the Revenue without adding to the\r\nburdens of the people_, a letter to Canning in 1813. He also wrote _A New\r\nTheory of the Tides_ (1822). His _Letter to Lord John Russell, on Lord\r\nBrougham's most extraordinary conduct; and another to Sir J. Herschel, on\r\nthe application of Kepler's third law_ appeared in 1832.\r\n\r\n[643] Lord John Russell (1792-1878) first Earl Russell, was one of the\r\nstrongest supporters of the reform measures of the early Victorian period.\r\nHe became prime minister in 1847, and again in 1865.\r\n\r\n[644] Lauder seems never to have written anything else.\r\n\r\n[645] See note 22, page 40.\r\n\r\n[646] The names of Alphonso Cano de Molina, Yvon, and Robert Sara have no\r\nstanding in the history of the subject beyond what would be inferred from\r\nDe Morgan's remark.\r\n\r\n[647] Claude Mydorge (1585-1647), an intimate friend of Descartes, was a\r\ndilletante in mathematics who read much but accomplished little. His\r\n_Recreations mathematiques_ is his chief work. Boncompagni published the\r\n\"Problemes de Mydorge\" in his _Bulletino_.\r\n\r\n[648] Claude Hardy was born towards the end of the 16th century and died at\r\nParis in 1678. In 1625 he edited the _Data Euclidis_, publishing the Greek\r\ntext with a Latin translation. He was a friend of Mydorge and Descartes,\r\nbut an opponent of Fermat.\r\n\r\n[649] That is, in the _Bibliotheca Realis_ of Martin Lipen, or Lipenius\r\n(1630-1692), which appeared in six folio volumes, at Frankfort, 1675-1685.\r\n\r\n[650] See note 29, page 43.\r\n\r\n[651] Baldassare Boncompagni (1821-1894) was the greatest general collector\r\nof mathematical works that ever lived, possibly excepting Libri. His\r\nmagnificent library was dispersed at his death. His _Bulletino_ (1868-1887)\r\nis one of the greatest source books on the history of mathematics that we\r\nhave. He also edited the works of Leonardo of Pisa.\r\n\r\n[652] He seems to have attracted no attention since De Morgan's search, for\r\nhe is not mentioned in recent bibliographies.\r\n\r\n[653] Joseph-Louis Vincens de Mouleon de Causans was born about the\r\nbeginning of the l8th century. He was a Knight of Malta, colonel in the\r\ninfantry, prince of Conti, and governor of the principality of Orange. His\r\nworks on geometry are the _Prospectus apologetique pour la quadrature du\r\ncercle_ (1753), and _La vraie geometrie transcendante_ (1754).\r\n\r\n[654] See note 119, page 80.\r\n\r\n[655] See note 120, page 81.\r\n\r\n[656] Lieut. William Samuel Stratford (1791-1853), was in active service\r\nduring the Napoleonic wars but retired from the army in 1815. He was first\r\nsecretary of the Astronomical Society (1820) and became superintendent of\r\nthe Nautical Almanac in 1831. With Francis Baily he compiled a star\r\ncatalogue, and wrote on Halley's (1835-1836) and Encke's (1838) comets.\r\n\r\n[657] See Sir J. Herschel's _Astronomy_, p. 369.--A. De M.\r\n\r\n[658] Captain Ross had just stuck a bit of brass there.--A. De M.\r\n\r\nSir James Clark Ross (1800-1862) was a rear admiral in the British navy and\r\nan arctic and antarctic explorer of prominence. De Morgan's reference is to\r\nRoss's discovery of the magnetic pole on June 1, 1831. In 1838 he was\r\nemployed by the Admiralty on a magnetic survey of the United Kingdom. He\r\nwas awarded the gold medal of the geographical societies of London and\r\nParis in 1842.\r\n\r\n[659] John Partridge (1644-1715), the well-known astrologer and almanac\r\nmaker. Although bound to a shoemaker in his early boyhood, he had acquired\r\nenough Latin at the age of eighteen to read the works of the astrologers.\r\nHe then mastered Greek and Hebrew and studied medicine. In 1680 he began\r\nthe publication of his almanac, the _Merlinus Liberatus_, a book that\r\nacquired literary celebrity largely through the witty comments upon it by\r\nsuch writers as Swift and Steele.\r\n\r\n[660] See note 642 on page 296.\r\n\r\n[661] William Woodley also published several almanacs (1838, 1839, 1840)\r\nafter his rejection by the Astronomical Society in 1834.\r\n\r\n[662] It appeared at London.\r\n\r\n[663] The first edition appeared in 1830, also at London.\r\n\r\n[664] See note 441, page 196.\r\n\r\n[665] Thomas Kerigan wrote _The Young Navigator's Guide to the siderial and\r\nplanetary parts of Nautical Astronomy_ (London, 1821, second edition 1828),\r\na work on eclipses (London, 1844), and the work on tides (London, 1847) to\r\nwhich De Morgan refers.\r\n\r\n[666] Jean Sylvain Bailly, who was guillotined. See note 365, page 166.\r\n\r\n[667] See note 670, page 309.\r\n\r\n[668] Laurent seems to have had faint glimpses of the modern theory of\r\nmatter. He is, however, unknown.\r\n\r\n[669] See note 133, page 87.\r\n\r\n[670] Francis Baily (1774-1844) was a London stockbroker. His interest in\r\nscience in general and in astronomy in particular led to his membership in\r\nthe Royal Society and to his presidency of the Astronomical Society. He\r\nwrote on interest and annuities (1808), but his chief works were on\r\nastronomy.\r\n\r\n[671] If the story is correctly told Baily must have enjoyed his statement\r\nthat Gauss was \"the oldest mathematician now living.\" As a matter of fact\r\nhe was then only 58, three years the junior of Baily himself. Gauss was\r\nborn in 1777 and died in 1855, and Baily was quite right in saying that he\r\nwas \"generally thought to be the greatest\" mathematician then living.\r\n\r\n[672] Margaret Cooke, who married Flamsteed in 1692.\r\n\r\n[673] John Brinkley (1763-1835), senior wrangler, first Smith's prize-man\r\n(1788), Andrews professor of astronomy at Dublin, first Astronomer Royal\r\nfor Ireland (1792), F.R.S. (1803), Copley medallist, president of the Royal\r\nSociety and Bishop of Cloyne. His _Elements of Astronomy_ appeared in 1808.\r\n\r\n[674] See note 248, page 124.\r\n\r\n[675] See note 276, page 133.\r\n\r\n[676] See note 352, page 161.\r\n\r\n[677] \"It becomes the doctors of the Sorbonne to dispute, the Pope to\r\ndecree, and the mathematician to go to Paradise on a perpendicular line.\"\r\n\r\n[678] See note 124, page 83.\r\n\r\n[679] See note 621, page 288.\r\n\r\n[680] Sylvain van de Weyer, who was born at Louvain in 1802. He was a\r\njurist and statesman, holding the portfolio for foreign affairs\r\n(1831-1833), and being at one time ambassador to England.\r\n\r\n[681] Henry Crabb Robinson (1775-1867), correspondent of the _Times_ at\r\nAltona and in the Peninsula, and later foreign editor. He was one of the\r\nfounders of the Athenaeum Club and of University College, London. He seems\r\nto have known pretty much every one of his day, and his posthumous _Diary_\r\nattracted attention when it appeared.\r\n\r\n[682] Was this Whewell, who was at Trinity from 1812 to 1816 and became a\r\nfellow in 1817?\r\n\r\n[683] Tom Cribb (1781-1848) the champion pugilist. He had worked as a coal\r\nporter and hence received his nickname, the Black Diamond.\r\n\r\n[684] John Finleyson, or Finlayson, was born in Scotland in 1770 and died\r\nin London in 1854. He published a number of pamphlets that made a pretense\r\nto being scientific. Among his striking phrases and sentences are the\r\nstatements that the stars were made \"to amuse us in observing them\"; that\r\nthe earth is \"not shaped like a garden turnip as the Newtonians make it,\"\r\nand that the stars are \"oval-shaped immense masses of frozen water.\" The\r\nfirst edition of the work here mentioned appeared at London in 1830.\r\n\r\n[685] Richard Brothers (1757-1824) was a native of Newfoundland. He went to\r\nLondon when he was about 30, and a little later set forth his claim to\r\nbeing a descendant of David, prince of the Hebrews, and ruler of the world.\r\nHe was confined as a criminal lunatic in 1795 but was released in 1806.\r\n\r\n[686] Charles Grey (1764-1845), second Earl Grey, Viscount Howick, was then\r\nPrime Minister. The Reform Bill was introduced and defeated in 1831. The\r\nfollowing year, with the Royal guarantees to allow him to create peers, he\r\nfinally carried the bill in spite of \"the number of the beast.\"\r\n\r\n[687] The letters of obscure men, the _Epistolae obscurorum virorum ad\r\nvenerabilem virum Magistrum Ortuinum Gratium Dauentriensem_, by Joannes\r\nCrotus, Ulrich von Hutten, and others appeared at Venice about 1516.\r\n\r\n[688] The lamentations of obscure men, the _Lamentationes obscurorum\r\nvirorum, non prohibete per sedem Apostolicam. Epistola D. Erasmi\r\nRoterodami: quid de obscuris sentiat_, by G. Ortwinus, appeared at Cologne\r\nin 1518.\r\n\r\n[689] The criticism was timely when De Morgan wrote it. At present it would\r\nhave but little force with respect to the better class of algebras.\r\n\r\n[690] Thomas Ignatius Maria Forster (1789-1860) was more of a man than one\r\nwould infer from this satire upon his theory. He was a naturalist,\r\nastronomer, and physiologist. In 1812 he published his _Researches about\r\nAtmospheric Phenomena_, and seven years later (July 3, 1819) he discovered\r\na comet. With Sir Richard Phillips he founded a Meteorological Society, but\r\nit was short lived. He declined a fellowship in the Royal Society because\r\nhe disapproved of certain of its rules, so that he had a recognized\r\nstanding in his day. The work mentioned by De Morgan is the second edition,\r\nthe first having appeared at Frankfort on the Main in 1835 under the title,\r\n_Recueil des ouvrages et des pensees d'un physicien et metaphysicien_.\r\n\r\n[691] Zadkiel, whose real name was Richard James Morrison (1795-1874), was\r\nin his early years an officer in the navy. In 1831 he began the publication\r\nof the _Herald of Astrology_, which was continued as _Zadkiel's Almanac_.\r\nHis name became familiar throughout Great Britain as a result.\r\n\r\n[692] See note 566, page 246.\r\n\r\n[693] Sumner (1780-1862) was an Eton boy. He went to King's College,\r\nCambridge, and was elected fellow in 1801. He took many honors, and in 1807\r\nbecame M.A. He was successively Canon of Durham (1820), Bishop of Chester\r\n(1828), and Archbishop of Canterbury (1848). Although he voted for the\r\nCatholic Relief Bill (1829) and the Reform Bill (1832), he opposed the\r\nremoval of Jewish disabilities.\r\n\r\n[694] Charles Richard Sumner (1790-1874) was not only Bishop of Winchester\r\n(1827), but also Bishop of Llandaff and Dean of St. Paul's, London (1826).\r\nHe lost the king's favor by voting for the Catholic Relief Bill.\r\n\r\n[695] John Bird Sumner, brother of Charles Richard.\r\n\r\n[696] Thomas Musgrave (1788-1860) became Fellow of Trinity in 1812, and\r\nsenior proctor in 1831. He was also Dean of Bristol.\r\n\r\n[697] Charles Thomas Longley (1794-1868) was educated at Westminster School\r\nand at Christ Church, Oxford. He became M.A. in 1818 and D.D. in 1829.\r\nBesides the bishoprics mentioned he was Bishop of Ripon (1836-1856), and\r\nbefore that was headmaster of Harrow (1829-1836).\r\n\r\n[698] Thomson (1819-1890) was scholar and fellow of Queen's College,\r\nOxford. He became chaplain to the Queen in 1859.\r\n\r\n[699] This is worthy of the statistical psychologists of the present day.\r\n\r\n[700] The famous Moon Hoax was written by Richard Adams Locke, who was born\r\nin New York in 1800 and died in Staten Island in 1871. He was at one time\r\neditor of the _Sun_, and the Hoax appeared in that journal in 1835. It was\r\nreprinted in London (1836) and Germany, and was accepted seriously by most\r\nreaders. It was published in book form in New York in 1852 under the title\r\n_The Moon Hoax_. Locke also wrote another hoax, the _Lost Manuscript of\r\nMungo Park_, but it attracted relatively little attention.\r\n\r\n[701] It is true that Jean-Nicolas Nicollet (1756-1843) was at that time in\r\nthe United States, but there does not seem to be any very tangible evidence\r\nto connect him with the story. He was secretary and librarian of the Paris\r\nobservatory (1817), member of the Bureau of Longitudes (1822), and teacher\r\nof mathematics in the Lycee Louis-le-Grand. Having lost his money through\r\nspeculations he left France for the United States in 1831 and became\r\nconnected with the government survey of the Mississippi Valley.\r\n\r\n[702] This was Alexis Bouvard (1767-1843), who made most of the\r\ncomputations for Laplace's _Mecanique celeste_ (1793). He discovered eight\r\nnew comets and calculated their orbits. In his tables of Uranus (1821) he\r\nattributed certain perturbations to the presence of an undiscovered planet,\r\nbut unlike Leverrier and Adams he did not follow up this clue and thus\r\ndiscover Neptune.\r\n\r\n[703] Patrick Murphy (1782-1847) awoke to find himself famous because of\r\nhis natural guess that there would be very cold weather on January 20,\r\nalthough that is generally the season of lowest temperature. It turned out\r\nthat his forecasts were partly right on 168 days and very wrong on 197\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n[704] He seems to have written nothing else. If one wishes to enter into\r\nthe subject of the mathematics of the Great Pyramid there is an extensive\r\nliterature awaiting him. Richard William Howard Vyse (1784-1853) published\r\nin 1840 his _Operations carried on at the Pyramids of Gizeh in 1837_, and\r\nin this he made a beginning of a scientific metrical study of the subject.\r\nCharles Piazzi Smyth (1819-1900), astronomer Royal for Scotland (1845-1888)\r\nwas much carried away with the number mysticism of the Great Pyramid, so\r\nmuch so that he published in 1864 a work entitled _Our Inheritance in the\r\nGreat Pyramid_, in which his vagaries were set forth. Although he was then\r\na Fellow of the Royal Society (1857), his work was so ill received that\r\nwhen he offered a paper on the subject it was rejected (1874) and he\r\nresigned in consequence of this action. The latest and perhaps the most\r\nscholarly of all investigators of the subject is William Matthew Flinders\r\nPetrie (born in 1853), Edwards professor of Egyptology at University\r\nCollege, London, whose _Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh_ (1883) and\r\nsubsequent works are justly esteemed as authorities.\r\n\r\n[705] As De Morgan subsequently found, this name reversed becomes Oliver\r\nB...e, for Oliver Byrne, one of the odd characters among the minor\r\nmathematical writers of the middle of the last century. One of his most\r\ncurious works is _The first six Books of the Elements of Euclid; in which\r\ncoloured diagrams and symbols are used instead of letters_ (1847). There is\r\nsome merit in speaking of the red triangle instead of the triangle ABC, but\r\nnot enough to give the method any standing. His _Dual Arithmetic_\r\n(1863-1867) was also a curious work.\r\n\r\n[706] Brenan also wrote on English composition (1829), a work that went\r\nthrough fourteen editions by 1865; a work entitled _The Foreigner's English\r\nConjugator_ (1831), and a work on the national debt.\r\n\r\n[707] See note 211, page 112.\r\n\r\n[708] See note 592, page 261.\r\n\r\n[709] Sir William Rowan Hamilton (1805-1865), the discoverer of quaternions\r\n(1852), was an infant prodigy, competing with Zerah Colburn as a child. He\r\nwas a linguist of remarkable powers, being able, at thirteen years of age,\r\nto boast that he knew as many languages as he had lived years. When only\r\nsixteen he found an error in Laplace's _Mecanique celeste_. When only\r\ntwenty-two he was appointed Andrews professor of astronomy, and he soon\r\nafter became Astronomer Royal of Ireland. He was knighted in 1835. His\r\nearlier work was on optics, his _Theory of Systems of Rays_ appearing in\r\n1823. In 1827 he published a paper on the principle of _Varying Action_. He\r\nalso wrote on dynamics.\r\n\r\n[710] \"Let him not leave the kingdom,\"--a legal phrase.\r\n\r\n[711] Probably De Morgan is referring to Johann Bernoulli III (1744-1807),\r\nwho edited Lambert's _Logische und philosophische Abhandlungen_, Berlin,\r\n1782. He was astronomer of the Academy of Sciences at Berlin.\r\n\r\n[712] Jacob Bernoulli (1654-1705) was one of the two brothers who founded\r\nthe famous Bernoulli family of mathematicians, the other being Johann I.\r\nHis _Ars conjectandi_ (1713), published posthumously, was the first\r\ndistinct treatise on probabilities.\r\n\r\n[713] Johann Heinrich Lambert (1728-1777) was one of the most learned men\r\nof his time. Although interested chiefly in mathematics, he wrote also on\r\nscience, logic, and philosophy.\r\n\r\n[714] Joseph Diez Gergonne (1771-1859), a soldier under Napoleon, and\r\nfounder of the _Annales de mathematiques_ (1810).\r\n\r\n[715] Gottfried Ploucquet (1716-1790) was at first a clergyman, but\r\nafterwards became professor of logic at Tuebingen.\r\n\r\n[716] \"In the premises let the middle term be omitted; what remains\r\nindicates the conclusion.\"\r\n\r\n[717] Probably Sir William Edmond Logan (1789-1875), who became so\r\ninterested in geology as to be placed at the head of the geological survey\r\nof Canada (1842). The University of Montreal conferred the title LL.D. upon\r\nhim, and Napoleon III gave him the cross of the Legion of Honor.\r\n\r\n[718] \"So strike that he may think himself to die.\"\r\n\r\n[719] \"Witticism or piece of stupidity.\"\r\n\r\n[720] A very truculently unjust assertion: for Sir W. was as great a setter\r\nup of some as he was a puller down of others. His writings are a congeries\r\nof praises and blames, both _cruel smart_, as they say in the States. But\r\nthe combined instigation of prose, rhyme, and retort would send Aristides\r\nhimself to Tartarus, if it were not pretty certain that Minos would grant a\r\n_stet processus_ under the circumstances. The first two verses are\r\nexaggerations standing on a basis of truth. The fourth verse is quite true:\r\nSir W. H. was an Edinburgh Aristotle, with the difference of ancient and\r\nmodern Athens well marked, especially the _perfervidum ingenium\r\nScotorum_.--A. De M.\r\n\r\n[721] See note 576, p. 252. There was also a _Theory of Parallels_ that\r\ndiffered from these, London, 1853, second edition 1856, third edition 1856.\r\n\r\n[722] The work was written by Robert Chambers (1802-1871), the Edinburgh\r\npublisher, a friend of Scott and of many of his contemporaries in the\r\nliterary field. He published the _Vestiges of the Natural History of\r\nCreation_ in 1844, not 1840.\r\n\r\n[723] Everett (1784-1872) was at that time a good Wesleyan, but was\r\nexpelled from the ministry in 1849 for having written _Wesleyan Takings_\r\nand as under suspicion for having started the _Fly Sheets_ in 1845. In 1857\r\nhe established the United Methodist Free Church.\r\n\r\n[724] Smith was a Primitive Methodist preacher. He also wrote an _Earnest\r\nAddress to the Methodists_ (1841) and _The Wealth Question_ (1840?).\r\n\r\n[725] He wrote the _Nouveau traite de Balistique_, Paris, 1837.\r\n\r\n[726] Joseph Denison, known to fame only through De Morgan. See also page\r\n353.\r\n\r\n[727] The radical (1784?-1858), advocate of the founding of London\r\nuniversity (1826), of medical reform (1827-1834), and of the repeal of the\r\nduties on newspapers and corn, and an ardent champion of penny postage.\r\n\r\n[728] I. e., Roman Catholic Priest.\r\n\r\n[729] Murphy (1806-1843) showed extraordinary powers in mathematics even\r\nbefore the age of thirteen. He became a fellow of Caius College, Cambridge,\r\nin 1829, dean in 1831, and examiner in mathematics in London University in\r\n1838.\r\n\r\n[730] See note 442, page 196.\r\n\r\n[731] Sir John Bowring (1792-1872), the linguist, writer, and traveler,\r\nmember of many learned societies and a writer of high reputation in his\r\ntime. His works were not, however, of genuine merit.\r\n\r\n[732] Joseph Hume (1777-1855) served as a surgeon with the British army in\r\nIndia early in the nineteenth century. He returned to England in 1808 and\r\nentered parliament as a radical in 1812. He was much interested in all\r\nreform movements.\r\n\r\n[733] Sir Robert Harry Inglis (1786-1855), a strong Tory, known for his\r\nnumerous addresses in the House of Commons rather than for any real\r\nability.\r\n\r\n[734] Sir Robert Peel (1788-1850) began his parliamentary career in 1809\r\nand was twice prime minister. He was prominent in most of the great reforms\r\nof his time.\r\n\r\n[735] See note 627, page 290.\r\n\r\n[736] John Taylor (1781-1864) was a publisher, and published several\r\npamphlets opposed to Peel's currency measures. De Morgan refers to his work\r\non the Junius question. This was done early in his career, and resulted in\r\n_A Discovery of the author of the Letters of Junius_ (1813), and _The\r\nIdentity of Junius with a distinguished living character established_\r\n(1816), this being Sir Philip Francis.\r\n\r\n[737] See note 665, page 308.\r\n\r\n[738] See page 348.\r\n\r\n[739] See note 348, page 160.\r\n\r\n[740] Sir Nicholas Harris Nicolas (1799-1848) was a reformer in various\r\nlines,--the Record Commission, the Society of Antiquaries, and the British\r\nMuseum,--and his work was not without good results.\r\n\r\n[741] See note 98, page 69.\r\n\r\n[742] In the _Companion to the Almanac_ for 1845 is a paper by Prof. De\r\nMorgan, \"On the Ecclesiastical Calendar,\" the statements of which, so far\r\nas concerns the Gregorian Calendar, are taken direct from the work of\r\nClavius, the principal agent in the arrangement of the reformed reckoning.\r\nThis was followed, in the _Companion to the Almanac_ for 1846, by a second\r\npaper, by the same author, headed \"On the Earliest Printed Almanacs,\" much\r\nof which is written in direct supplement to the former article.--S. E. De\r\nMorgan.\r\n\r\n[743] It may be necessary to remind some English readers that in Latin and\r\nits derived European languages, what we call Easter is called the passover\r\n(_pascha_). The Quartadecimans had the _name_ on their side: a possession\r\nwhich often is, in this world, nine points of the law.--A. De M.\r\n\r\n[744] Socrates Scholasticus was born at Constantinople c. 379, and died\r\nafter 439. His _Historia Ecclesiastica_ (in Greek) covers the period from\r\nConstantine the Great to about 439, and includes the Council of Nicaea. The\r\nwork was printed in Paris 1544.\r\n\r\n[745] Theodoretus or Theodoritus was born at Antioch and died about 457. He\r\nwas one of the greatest divines of the fifth century, a man of learning,\r\npiety, and judicial mind, and a champion of freedom of opinion in all\r\nreligious matters.\r\n\r\n[746] He died in 417. He was a man of great energy and of high attainments.\r\n\r\n[747] He died in 461, having reigned as pope for twenty-one years. It was\r\nhe who induced Attila to spare Rome in 452.\r\n\r\n[748] He succeeded Leo as pope in 461, and reigned for seven years.\r\n\r\n[749] Victorinus or Victorius Marianus seems to have been born at Limoges.\r\nHe was a mathematician and astronomer, and the cycle mentioned by De Morgan\r\nis one of 532 years, a combination of the Metonic cycle of 19 years with\r\nthe solar cycle of 28 years. His canon was published at Antwerp in 1633 or\r\n1634, _De doctrina temporum sive commentarius in Victorii Aquitani et\r\naliorum canones paschales_.\r\n\r\n[750] He went to Rome about 497, and died there in 540. He wrote his _Liber\r\nde paschate_ in 525, and it was in this work that the Christian era was\r\nfirst used for calendar purposes.\r\n\r\n[751] See note 259, page 126.\r\n\r\n[752] Johannes de Sacrobosco (Holy wood), or John of Holywood. The name was\r\noften written, without regard to its etymology, Sacrobusto. He was educated\r\nat Oxford and taught in Paris until his death (1256). He did much to make\r\nthe Hindu-Arabic numerals known to European scholars.\r\n\r\n[753] See note 36, page 44.\r\n\r\n[754] See note 45, page 48.\r\n\r\n[755] The Julian year is a year of the Julian Calendar, in which there is\r\nleap year every fourth year. Its average length is therefore 365 days and a\r\nquarter.--A. De M.\r\n\r\n[756] Ugo Buoncompagno (1502-1585) was elected pope in 1572.\r\n\r\n[757] He was a Calabrian, and as early as 1552 was professor of medicine at\r\nPerugia. In 1576 his manuscript on the reform of the calendar was presented\r\nto the Roman Curia by his brother, Antonius. The manuscript was not printed\r\nand it has not been preserved.\r\n\r\n[758] The title of this work, which is the authority on all points of the\r\nnew Calendar, is _Kalendarium Gregorianum Perpetuum. Cum Privilegio Summi\r\nPontificis Et Aliorum Principum. Romae, Ex Officina Dominici Basae. MDLXXXII.\r\nCum Licentia Superiorum_ (quarto, pp. 60).--A. De M.\r\n\r\n[759] _Manuels-Roret. Theorie du Calendrier et collection de tous les\r\nCalendriers des Annees passees et futures_.... Par L. B. Francoeur,...\r\nParis, a la librairie encyclopedique de Roret, rue Hautefeuille, 10 bis.\r\n1842. (12mo.) In this valuable manual, the 35 possible almanacs are given\r\nat length, with such preliminary tables as will enable any one to find, by\r\nmere inspection, which almanac he is to choose for any year, whether of old\r\nor new style. [1866. I may now refer to my own _Book of Almanacs_, for the\r\nsame purpose].--A. De M.\r\n\r\nLouis Benjamin Francoeur (1773-1849), after holding positions in the Ecole\r\npolytechnique (1804) and the Lycee Charlemagne (1805), became professor of\r\nhigher algebra in the University of Paris (1809). His _Cours complet des\r\nmathematiques pures_ was well received, and he also wrote on mechanics,\r\nastronomy, and geodesy.\r\n\r\n[760] Albertus Pighius, or Albert Pigghe, was born at Kempen c. 1490 and\r\ndied at Utrecht in 1542. He was a mathematician and a firm defender of the\r\nfaith, asserting the supremacy of the Pope and attacking both Luther and\r\nCalvin. He spent some time in Rome. His greatest work was his _Hierarchiae\r\necclesiasticae assertio_ (1538).\r\n\r\n[761] This was A. F. Vogel. The work was his translation from the German\r\nedition which appeared at Leipsic the same year, _Entdeckung einer\r\nnumerischen General-Aufloesung aller hoeheren endlichen Gleichungen von jeder\r\nbeliebigen algebraischen und transcendenten Form_.\r\n\r\n[762] The latest edition of Burnside and Panton's _Theory of Equations_ has\r\nthis brief summary of the present status of the problem: \"Demonstrations\r\nhave been given by Abel and Wantzel (see Serret's _Cours d'Algebre\r\nSuperieure_, Art. 516) of the impossibility of resolving algebraically\r\nequations unrestricted in form, of a degree higher than the fourth. A\r\ntranscendental solution, however, of the quintic has been given by M.\r\nHermite, in a form involving elliptic integrals.\"\r\n\r\n[763] There was a second edition of this work in 1846. The author's\r\n_Astronomy Simplified_ was published in 1838, and the _Thoughts on Physical\r\nAstronomy_ in 1840, with a second edition in 1842.\r\n\r\n[764] This was _The Science of the Weather, by several authors... edited by\r\nB._, Glasgow, 1867.\r\n\r\n[765] This was Y. Ramachandra, son of Sundara L[=a]la. He was a teacher of\r\nscience in Delhi College, and the work to which De Morgan refers is _A\r\nTreatise on problems of Maxima and Minima solved by Algebra_, which\r\nappeared at Calcutta in 1850. De Morgan's edition was published at London\r\nnine years later.\r\n\r\n[766] Abraham de Moivre (1667-1754), French refugee in London, poor,\r\nstudying under difficulties, was a man with tastes in some respects like\r\nthose of De Morgan. For one thing, he was a lover of books, and he had a\r\ngood deal of interest in the theory of probabilities to which De Morgan\r\nalso gave much thought. His introduction of imaginary quantities into\r\ntrigonometry was an event of importance in the history of mathematics, and\r\nthe theorem that bears his name, (cos [phi] + i sin [phi])^{n} = cos n[phi]\r\n+ i sin n[phi], is one of the most important ones in all analysis.\r\n\r\n[767] John Dolland (1706-1761), the silk weaver who became the greatest\r\nmaker of optical instruments in his time.\r\n\r\n[768] Thomas Simpson (1710-1761), also a weaver, taking his leisure from\r\nhis loom at Spitalfields to teach mathematics. His _New Treatise on\r\nFluxions_ (1737) was written only two years after he began working in\r\nLondon, and six years later he was appointed professor of mathematics at\r\nWoolwich. He wrote many works on mathematics and Simpson's Formulas for\r\ncomputing trigonometric tables are still given in the text-books.\r\n\r\n[769] Nicholas Saunderson (1682-1739), the blind mathematician. He lost his\r\neyesight through smallpox when only a year old. At the age of 25 he began\r\nlecturing at Cambridge on the principles of the Newtonian philosophy. His\r\n_Algebra_, in two large volumes, was long the standard treatise on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n[770] He was not in the class with the others mentioned.\r\n\r\n[771] Not known in the literature of mathematics.\r\n\r\n[772] Probably J. Butler Williams whose _Practical Geodesy_ appeared in\r\n1842, with a third edition in 1855.\r\n\r\n[773] Benjamin Gompertz (1779-1865) was debarred as a Jew from a university\r\neducation. He studied mathematics privately and became president of the\r\nMathematical Society. De Morgan knew him professionally through the fact\r\nthat he was prominent in actuarial work.\r\n\r\n[774] Referring to the contributions of Archimedes (287-212 B.C.) to the\r\nmensuration of the sphere.\r\n\r\n[775] The famous Alexandrian astronomer (c. 87-c. 165 A.D.), author of the\r\n_Almagest_, a treatise founded on the works of Hipparchus.\r\n\r\n[776] Dr. Whewell, when I communicated this song to him, started the\r\nopinion, which I had before him, that this was a very good idea, of which\r\ntoo little was made.--A. De M.\r\n\r\n[777] See note 117, page 76.\r\n\r\n[778] The common epithet of rank: _nobilis Tycho_, as he was a nobleman.\r\nThe writer had been at history.--A. De M.\r\n\r\nSee note 117, page 76.\r\n\r\n[779] He lost it in a duel, with Manderupius Pasbergius. A contemporary,\r\nT. B. Laurus, insinuates that they fought to settle which was the best\r\nmathematician! This seems odd, but it must be remembered they fought in the\r\ndark, \"_in tenebris densis_\"; and it is a nice problem to shave off a nose\r\nin the dark, without any other harm.--A. De M.\r\n\r\nWas this T. B. Laurus Joannes Baptista Laurus or Giovanni Battista Lauro\r\n(1581-1621), the poet and writer?\r\n\r\n[780] See note 117, page 76.\r\n\r\n[781] Referring to Kepler's celebrated law of planetary motion. He had\r\npreviously wasted his time on analogies between the planetary orbits and\r\nthe polyhedrons.--A. De M.\r\n\r\n[782] See note 117, page 76.\r\n\r\n[783] \"It does move though.\"\r\n\r\n[784] As great a lie as ever was told: but in 1800 a compliment to Newton\r\nwithout a fling at Descartes would have been held a lopsided structure.--A.\r\nDe M.\r\n\r\n[785] Jean-le-Rond D'Alembert (1717-1783), the foundling who was left on\r\nthe steps of Jean-le-Rond in Paris, and who became one of the greatest\r\nmathematical physicists and astronomers of his century.\r\n\r\n[786] Leonhard Euler (1707-1783), friend of the Bernoullis, the greatest of\r\nSwiss mathematicians, prominent in the theory of numbers, and known for\r\ndiscoveries in all lines of mathematics as then studied.\r\n\r\n[787] See notes 478, 479, page 219.\r\n\r\n[788] See note 621, page 288.\r\n\r\n[789] See note 584, page 255.\r\n\r\n[790] The _siderial_ day is about four minutes short of the solar; there\r\nare 366 sidereal days in the year.--A. De M.\r\n\r\n[791] The founding of the London Mathematical Society is discussed by Mrs.\r\nDe Morgan in her _Memoir_ (p. 281). The idea came from a conversation\r\nbetween her brilliant son, George Campbell De Morgan, and his friend Arthur\r\nCowper Ranyard in 1864. The meeting of organization was held on Nov. 7,\r\n1864, with Professor De Morgan in the chair, and the first regular meeting\r\non January 16, 1865.\r\n\r\n[792] See note 33, page 43.\r\n\r\n[793] See note 119, page 80.\r\n\r\n[794] John Russell Hind (b. 1823), the astronomer. Between 1847 and 1854 he\r\ndiscovered ten planetoids.\r\n\r\n[795] Sir Roderick Impey Murchison (1792-1871), the great geologist. He was\r\nknighted in 1846 and devoted the latter part of his life to the work of the\r\nRoyal Geographical Society and to the geology of Scotland.\r\n\r\n[796] Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel (1784-1846), the astronomer and physicist.\r\nHe was professor of astronomy at Koenigsberg.\r\n\r\n[797] This was the _Reduction of the Observations of Planets made ... from\r\n1750 to 1830: computed ... under the superintendence of George Biddell\r\nAiry_ (1848). See note 129, page 85.\r\n\r\n[798] The expense of this magnificent work was defrayed by Government\r\ngrants, obtained, at the instance of the British Association, in 1833--A.\r\nDe M.\r\n\r\n[799] See note 32, page 43.\r\n\r\n[800] Franz Friedrich Ernst Bruennow (1821-1891) was at that time or shortly\r\nbefore director of the observatory at Dusseldorf. He then went to Berlin\r\nand thence (1854) to Ann Arbor, Michigan. He then went to Dublin and\r\nfinally became Royal Astronomer of Ireland.\r\n\r\n[801] Johann Gottfried Galle (1812-1910), at that time connected with the\r\nBerlin observatory, and later professor of astronomy at Breslau.\r\n\r\n[802] George Bishop (1785-1861), in whose observatory in Regent's Park\r\nimportant observations were made by Dawes, Hind, and Marth.\r\n\r\n[803] James Challis (1803-1882), director of the Cambridge observatory, and\r\nsuccessor of Airy as Plumian professor of astronomy.\r\n\r\n[804] On Leverrier and Arago see note 33, page 43, and note 561, page 243.\r\n\r\n[805] Robert Grant's (1814-1892) _History of Physical Astronomy from the\r\nEarliest Ages to the Middle of the Nineteenth Century_ appeared in 1852. He\r\nwas professor of astronomy and director of the observatory at Glasgow.\r\n\r\n[806] John Debenham was more interested in religion than in astronomy. He\r\nwrote _The Strait Gate; or, the true scripture doctrine of salvation\r\nclearly explained_, London, 1843, and _Tractatus de magis et Bethlehemae\r\nstella et Christi in deserto tentatione_, privately printed at London in\r\n1845.\r\n\r\n[807] More properly the Sydney Smirke reading room, since it was built from\r\nhis designs.\r\n\r\n[808] The Antinomians were followers of Johannes Agricola (1494-1566). They\r\nbelieved that Christians as such were released from all obligations to the\r\nOld Testament. Some went so far as to assert that, since all Christians\r\nwere sanctified, they could not lose this sanctity even though they\r\ndisobeyed God. The sect was prominent in England in the seventeenth\r\ncentury, and was transferred to New England. Here it suffered a check in\r\nthe condemnation of Mrs. Ann Hutchinson (1636) by the Newton Synod.\r\n\r\n[809] Aside from this work and his publications on Reeve and Muggleton he\r\nwrote nothing. With Joseph Frost he published _A list_ _of Books and\r\ngeneral index to J. Reeve and L. Muggleton's works_ (1846), _Divine Songs\r\nof the Muggletonians_ (1829), and the work mentioned on page 396. _The\r\nworks of J. Reeve and L. Muggleton_ (1832).\r\n\r\n[810] About 1650 he and his cousin John Reeve (1608-1658) began to have\r\nvisions. As part of their creed they taught that astronomy was opposed by\r\nthe Bible. They asserted that the sun moves about the earth, and Reeve\r\nfigured out that heaven was exactly six miles away. Both Muggleton and\r\nReeve were imprisoned for their unitarian views. Muggleton wrote a\r\n_Transcendant Spirituall Treatise_ (1652). I have before me _A true\r\nInterpretation of All the Chief Texts ... of the whole Book of the\r\nRevelation of St. John.... By Lodowick Muggleton, one of the two last\r\nCommissioned Witnesses & Prophets of the onely high, immortal, glorious\r\nGod, Christ Jesus_ (1665), in which the interpretation of the \"number of\r\nthe beast\" occupies four pages without arriving anywhere.\r\n\r\n[811] In 1652 he was, in a vision, named as the Lord's \"last messenger,\"\r\nwith Muggleton as his \"mouth,\" and died six years later, probably of\r\nnervous tension resulting from his divine \"illumination.\" He was the more\r\nspiritual of the two.\r\n\r\n[812] William Guthrie (1708-1770) was a historian and political writer. His\r\n_History of England_ (1744-1751) was the first attempt to base history on\r\nparliamentary records. He also wrote a _General History of Scotland_ in 10\r\nvolumes (1767). The work to which Frost refers is the _Geographical,\r\nHistorical, and Commercial Grammar_ (1770) which contained an astronomical\r\npart by J. Ferguson. By 1827 it had passed through 24 editions.\r\n\r\n[813] George Fox (1624-1691), founder of the Society of Friends; a mystic\r\nand a disciple of Boehme. He was eight times imprisoned for heresy.\r\n\r\n[814] If they were friends they were literary antagonists, for Muggleton\r\nwrote against Fox _The Neck of the Quakers Broken_ (1663), and Fox replied\r\nin 1667. Muggleton also wrote _A Looking Glass for George Fox_.\r\n\r\n[815] John Conduitt (1688-1737), who married (1717) Newton's half niece,\r\nMrs. Katherine Barton. See note 284, page 136.\r\n\r\n[816] Probably Peter Mark Roget's (1779-1869) _Thesaurus of English Words_\r\n(1852) is not much used at present, but it went through 28 editions in his\r\nlifetime. Few who use the valuable work are aware that Roget was a\r\nprofessor of physiology at the Royal Institution (London), that he achieved\r\nhis title of F. R. S. because of his work in perfecting the slide rule, and\r\nthat he followed Sir John Herschel as secretary of the Royal Society.\r\n\r\n[817] See note 703, page 327. This work went into a second edition in the\r\nyear of its first publication.\r\n\r\n[818] See note 398, page 177.\r\n\r\n[819] See note 528, page 233.\r\n\r\n[820] George Jacob Holyoake (1817-1906) entered into a controversial life\r\nat an early age. In 1841 he was imprisoned for six months for blasphemy. He\r\nfounded and edited _The Reasoner_ (Vols. 1-26, 1846-1861). In his later\r\nlife he did much to promote cooperation among the working class.\r\n\r\n[821] See note 176, page 102.\r\n\r\n[822] William Thomas Lowndes (1798-1843), whose _Bibliographer's Manual of\r\nEnglish Literature_, 4 vols., London, 1834 (also 1857-1864, and 1869) is a\r\nclassic in its line.\r\n\r\n[823] Jacques Charles Brunet (1780-1867), the author of the great French\r\nbibliography, the _Manuel du Libraire_ (1810).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCorrections made to printed original.\r\n\r\nPage 5, \"direct acquaintance with the whole of his mental ancestry\":\r\n'acquantance' in original.\r\n\r\nPage 100, \"The error is at the rate\": 'it' (for 'is') in original.\r\n\r\nPage 192, \"the lineal successor of the Repository association\":\r\n'successsor' in original.\r\n\r\nPage 211, \"the doctors had finished their compliments\": 'docters' in\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\nPage 302, \"causing mutual perturbations\": 'peturbations' in original.\r\n\r\nPage 344, \"The work itself is described\": 'decribed' in original.\r\n\r\nPage 370, The entry for 1852 is printed as 19, it appears that the correct\r\nvalue should be 9.\r\n\r\nPage 392, \"Sir John Herschel's previous communication\": 'pervious' in\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\nNote 317, \"he constructed a working model of a steam road carriage\":\r\n'contructed' in original.\r\n\r\nNote 380, \"the variation of the Earth's Diameters\": 'Diaameters' in\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\nNote 550, \"The first edition of the anonymous [Greek]\": 'anonynous' in\r\noriginal.",
