Few books have\r\nexercised a wider influence in their time. It has been translated into\r\nevery European tongue, and into English nearly a dozen times, from King\r\nAlfred's paraphrase to the translations of Lord Preston, Causton,\r\nRidpath, and Duncan, in the eighteenth century. The belief that what\r\nonce pleased so widely must still have some charm is my excuse for\r\nattempting the present translation. The great work of Boethius, with its\r\nalternate prose and verse, skilfully fitted together like dialogue and\r\nchorus in a Greek play, is unique in literature, and has a pathetic\r\ninterest from the time and circumstances of its composition. It ought\r\nnot to be forgotten. Those who can go to the original will find their\r\nreward. There may be room also for a new translation in English after an\r\ninterval of close on a hundred years.\r\n\r\nSome of the editions contain a reproduction of a bust purporting to\r\nrepresent Boethius. Lord Preston's translation, for example, has such a\r\nportrait, which it refers to an original in marble at Rome. This I have\r\nbeen unable to trace, and suspect that it is apocryphal. The Hope\r\nCollection at Oxford contains a completely different portrait in a\r\nprint, which gives no authority. I have ventured to use as a\r\nfrontispiece a reproduction from a plaster-cast in the Ashmolean Museum,\r\ntaken from an ivory diptych preserved in the Bibliotheca Quiriniana at\r\nBrescia, which represents Narius Manlius Boethius, the father of the\r\nphilosopher. Portraiture of this period is so rare that it seemed that,\r\nfailing a likeness of the author himself, this authentic representation\r\nof his father might have interest, as giving the consular dress and\r\ninsignia of the time, and also as illustrating the decadence of\r\ncontemporary art. The consul wears a richly-embroidered cloak; his right\r\nhand holds a staff surmounted by the Roman eagle, his left the _mappa\r\ncircensis,_ or napkin used for starting the races in the circus; at his\r\nfeet are palms and bags of money--prizes for the victors in the games.\r\nFor permission to use this cast my thanks are due to the authorities of\r\nthe Ashmolean Museum, as also to Mr. T.W. Jackson, Curator of the Hope\r\nCollection, who first called my attention to its existence.\r\n\r\nI have to thank my brother, Mr. L. James, of Radley College, for much\r\nvaluable help and for correcting the proof-sheets of the translation.\r\nThe text used is that of Peiper, Leipsic, 1874.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROEM.\r\n\r\nAnicus Manlius Severinus Boethius lived in the last quarter of the fifth\r\ncentury A.D., and the first quarter of the sixth. He was growing to\r\nmanhood, when Theodoric, the famous Ostrogoth, crossed the Alps and made\r\nhimself master of Italy. Boethius belonged to an ancient family, which\r\nboasted a connection with the legendary glories of the Republic, and was\r\nstill among the foremost in wealth and dignity in the days of Rome's\r\nabasement. His parents dying early, he was brought up by Symmachus, whom\r\nthe age agreed to regard as of almost saintly character, and afterwards\r\nbecame his son-in-law. His varied gifts, aided by an excellent\r\neducation, won for him the reputation of the most accomplished man of\r\nhis time. He was orator, poet, musician, philosopher. It is his peculiar\r\ndistinction to have handed on to the Middle Ages the tradition of Greek\r\nphilosophy by his Latin translations of the works of Aristotle. Called\r\nearly to a public career, the highest honours of the State came to him\r\nunsought. He was sole Consul in 510 A.D., and was ultimately raised by\r\nTheodoric to the dignity of Magister Officiorum, or head of the whole\r\ncivil administration. He was no less happy in his domestic life, in the\r\nvirtues of his wife, Rusticiana, and the fair promise of his two sons,\r\nSymmachus and Boethius; happy also in the society of a refined circle of\r\nfriends. Noble, wealthy, accomplished, universally esteemed for his\r\nvirtues, high in the favour of the Gothic King, he appeared to all men a\r\nsignal example of the union of merit and good fortune. His felicity\r\nseemed to culminate in the year 522 A.D., when, by special and\r\nextraordinary favour, his two sons, young as they were for so exalted an\r\nhonour, were created joint Consuls and rode to the senate-house\r\nattended by a throng of senators, and the acclamations of the multitude.\r\nBoethius himself, amid the general applause, delivered the public speech\r\nin the King's honour usual on such occasions. Within a year he was a\r\nsolitary prisoner at Pavia, stripped of honours, wealth, and friends,\r\nwith death hanging over him, and a terror worse than death, in the fear\r\nlest those dearest to him should be involved in the worst results of his\r\ndownfall. It is in this situation that the opening of the 'Consolation\r\nof Philosophy' brings Boethius before us. He represents himself as\r\nseated in his prison distraught with grief, indignant at the injustice\r\nof his misfortunes, and seeking relief for his melancholy in writing\r\nverses descriptive of his condition. Suddenly there appears to him the\r\nDivine figure of Philosophy, in the guise of a woman of superhuman\r\ndignity and beauty, who by a succession of discourses convinces him of\r\nthe vanity of regret for the lost gifts of fortune, raises his mind once\r\nmore to the contemplation of the true good, and makes clear to him the\r\nmystery of the world's moral government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nVERSE INTERLUDES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\nTHE SORROWS OF BOETHIUS.\r\n\r\nSONG                                          PAGE\r\n  I.

Philosophy appears to\r\n     Boethius, drives away the Muses of Poetry, and herself laments\r\n     (Song II.) the disordered condition of his mind.--CH. II. Boethius\r\n     is speechless with amazement. Philosophy wipes away the tears that\r\n     have clouded his eyesight.--CH. III. Boethius recognises his\r\n     mistress Philosophy. To his wondering inquiries she explains her\r\n     presence, and recalls to his mind the persecutions to which\r\n     Philosophy has oftentimes from of old been subjected by an ignorant\r\n     world. CH. IV. Philosophy bids Boethius declare his griefs. He\r\n     relates the story of his unjust accusation and ruin. He concludes\r\n     with a prayer (Song V.) that the moral disorder in human affairs\r\n     may be set right.--CH. V. Philosophy admits the justice of\r\n     Boethius' self-vindication, but grieves rather for the unhappy\r\n     change in his mind. She will first tranquillize his spirit by\r\n     soothing remedies.--CH. VI. Philosophy tests Boethius' mental\r\n     state by certain questions, and discovers three chief causes of his\r\n     soul's sickness: (1) He has forgotten his own true nature; (2) he\r\n     knows not the end towards which the whole universe tends; (3) he\r\n     knows not the means by which the world is governed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG I.\r\n\r\nBOETHIUS' COMPLAINT.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Who wrought my studious numbers\r\n      Smoothly once in happier days,\r\n    Now perforce in tears and sadness\r\n      Learn a mournful strain to raise.\r\n    Lo, the Muses, grief-dishevelled,\r\n      Guide my pen and voice my woe;\r\n    Down their cheeks unfeigned the tear drops\r\n      To my sad complainings flow!\r\n    These alone in danger's hour\r\n      Faithful found, have dared attend\r\n    On the footsteps of the exile\r\n      To his lonely journey's end.\r\n    These that were the pride and pleasure\r\n      Of my youth and high estate\r\n    Still remain the only solace\r\n      Of the old man's mournful fate.\r\n    Old? Ah yes; swift, ere I knew it,\r\n      By these sorrows on me pressed\r\n    Age hath come; lo, Grief hath bid me\r\n      Wear the garb that fits her best.\r\n    O'er my head untimely sprinkled\r\n      These white hairs my woes proclaim,\r\n    And the skin hangs loose and shrivelled\r\n      On this sorrow-shrunken frame.\r\n    Blest is death that intervenes not\r\n      In the sweet, sweet years of peace,\r\n    But unto the broken-hearted,\r\n      When they call him, brings release!\r\n    Yet Death passes by the wretched,\r\n      Shuts his ear and slumbers deep;\r\n    Will not heed the cry of anguish,\r\n      Will not close the eyes that weep.\r\n    For, while yet inconstant Fortune\r\n      Poured her gifts and all was bright,\r\n    Death's dark hour had all but whelmed me\r\n      In the gloom of endless night.\r\n    Now, because misfortune's shadow\r\n      Hath o'erclouded that false face,\r\n    Cruel Life still halts and lingers,\r\n      Though I loathe his weary race.\r\n    Friends, why did ye once so lightly\r\n      Vaunt me happy among men?\r\n    Surely he who so hath fallen\r\n      Was not firmly founded then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile I was thus mutely pondering within myself, and recording my\r\nsorrowful complainings with my pen, it seemed to me that there appeared\r\nabove my head a woman of a countenance exceeding venerable. Her eyes\r\nwere bright as fire, and of a more than human keenness; her complexion\r\nwas lively, her vigour showed no trace of enfeeblement; and yet her\r\nyears were right full, and she plainly seemed not of our age and time.\r\nHer stature was difficult to judge. At one moment it exceeded not the\r\ncommon height, at another her forehead seemed to strike the sky; and\r\nwhenever she raised her head higher, she began to pierce within the very\r\nheavens, and to baffle the eyes of them that looked upon her. Her\r\ngarments were of an imperishable fabric, wrought with the finest threads\r\nand of the most delicate workmanship; and these, as her own lips\r\nafterwards assured me, she had herself woven with her own hands. The\r\nbeauty of this vesture had been somewhat tarnished by age and neglect,\r\nand wore that dingy look which marble contracts from exposure. On the\r\nlower-most edge was inwoven the Greek letter [Greek: P], on the topmost\r\nthe letter [Greek: Th],[A] and between the two were to be seen steps,\r\nlike a staircase, from the lower to the upper letter. This robe,\r\nmoreover, had been torn by the hands of violent persons, who had each\r\nsnatched away what he could clutch.[B] Her right hand held a note-book;\r\nin her left she bore a staff. And when she saw the Muses of Poesie\r\nstanding by my bedside, dictating the words of my lamentations, she was\r\nmoved awhile to wrath, and her eyes flashed sternly. 'Who,' said she,\r\n'has allowed yon play-acting wantons to approach this sick man--these\r\nwho, so far from giving medicine to heal his malady, even feed it with\r\nsweet poison? These it is who kill the rich crop of reason with the\r\nbarren thorns of passion, who accustom men's minds to disease, instead\r\nof setting them free. Now, were it some common man whom your allurements\r\nwere seducing, as is usually your way, I should be less indignant. On\r\nsuch a one I should not have spent my pains for naught. But this is one\r\nnurtured in the Eleatic and Academic philosophies. Nay, get ye gone, ye\r\nsirens, whose sweetness lasteth not; leave him for my muses to tend and\r\nheal!' At these words of upbraiding, the whole band, in deepened\r\nsadness, with downcast eyes, and blushes that confessed their shame,\r\ndolefully left the chamber.\r\n\r\nBut I, because my sight was dimmed with much weeping, and I could not\r\ntell who was this woman of authority so commanding--I was dumfoundered,\r\nand, with my gaze fastened on the earth, continued silently to await\r\nwhat she might do next. Then she drew near me and sat on the edge of my\r\ncouch, and, looking into my face all heavy with grief and fixed in\r\nsadness on the ground, she bewailed in these words the disorder of my\r\nmind:\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] [Greek: P] (P) stands for the Political life, the life of action;\r\n[Greek: Th] (Th) for the Theoretical life, the life of thought.\r\n\r\n[B] The Stoic, Epicurean, and other philosophical sects, which Boethius\r\nregards as heterodox. See also below, ch. iii., p. 14.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG II.\r\n\r\nHIS DESPONDENCY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Alas! in what abyss his mind\r\n      Is plunged, how wildly tossed!\r\n    Still, still towards the outer night\r\n      She sinks, her true light lost,\r\n    As oft as, lashed tumultuously\r\n    By earth-born blasts, care's waves rise high.\r\n\r\n    Yet once he ranged the open heavens,\r\n      The sun's bright pathway tracked;\r\n    Watched how the cold moon waxed and waned;\r\n      Nor rested, till there lacked\r\n    To his wide ken no star that steers\r\n    Amid the maze of circling spheres.\r\n\r\n    The causes why the blusterous winds\r\n      Vex ocean's tranquil face,\r\n    Whose hand doth turn the stable globe,\r\n      Or why his even race\r\n    From out the ruddy east the sun\r\n    Unto the western waves doth run:\r\n\r\n    What is it tempers cunningly\r\n      The placid hours of spring,\r\n    So that it blossoms with the rose\r\n      For earth's engarlanding:\r\n    Who loads the year's maturer prime\r\n    With clustered grapes in autumn time:\r\n\r\n    All this he knew--thus ever strove\r\n      Deep Nature's lore to guess.\r\n    Now, reft of reason's light, he lies,\r\n      And bonds his neck oppress;\r\n    While by the heavy load constrained,\r\n    His eyes to this dull earth are chained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\n'But the time,' said she, 'calls rather for healing than for\r\nlamentation.' Then, with her eyes bent full upon me, 'Art thou that\r\nman,' she cries, 'who, erstwhile fed with the milk and reared upon the\r\nnourishment which is mine to give, had grown up to the full vigour of a\r\nmanly spirit? And yet I had bestowed such armour on thee as would have\r\nproved an invincible defence, hadst thou not first cast it away. Dost\r\nthou know me? Why art thou silent? Is it shame or amazement that hath\r\nstruck thee dumb? Would it were shame; but, as I see, a stupor hath\r\nseized upon thee.' Then, when she saw me not only answering nothing, but\r\nmute and utterly incapable of speech, she gently touched my breast with\r\nher hand, and said: 'There is no danger; these are the symptoms of\r\nlethargy, the usual sickness of deluded minds. For awhile he has\r\nforgotten himself; he will easily recover his memory, if only he first\r\nrecognises me. And that he may do so, let me now wipe his eyes that are\r\nclouded with a mist of mortal things.' Thereat, with a fold of her robe,\r\nshe dried my eyes all swimming with tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG III.\r\n\r\nTHE MISTS DISPELLED.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Then the gloom of night was scattered,\r\n      Sight returned unto mine eyes.\r\n    So, when haply rainy Caurus\r\n      Rolls the storm-clouds through the skies,\r\n    Hidden is the sun; all heaven\r\n      Is obscured in starless night.\r\n    But if, in wild onset sweeping,\r\n      Boreas frees day's prisoned light,\r\n    All suddenly the radiant god outstreams,\r\n    And strikes our dazzled eyesight with his beams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven so the clouds of my melancholy were broken up. I saw the clear sky,\r\nand regained the power to recognise the face of my physician.\r\nAccordingly, when I had lifted my eyes and fixed my gaze upon her, I\r\nbeheld my nurse, Philosophy, whose halls I had frequented from my youth\r\nup.\r\n\r\n'Ah! why,' I cried, 'mistress of all excellence, hast thou come down\r\nfrom on high, and entered the solitude of this my exile? Is it that\r\nthou, too, even as I, mayst be persecuted with false accusations?'\r\n\r\n'Could I desert thee, child,' said she, 'and not lighten the burden\r\nwhich thou hast taken upon thee through the hatred of my name, by\r\nsharing this trouble? Even forgetting that it were not lawful for\r\nPhilosophy to leave companionless the way of the innocent, should I,\r\nthinkest thou, fear to incur reproach, or shrink from it, as though\r\nsome strange new thing had befallen? Thinkest thou that now, for the\r\nfirst time in an evil age, Wisdom hath been assailed by peril? Did I not\r\noften in days of old, before my servant Plato lived, wage stern warfare\r\nwith the rashness of folly? In his lifetime, too, Socrates, his master,\r\nwon with my aid the victory of an unjust death. And when, one after the\r\nother, the Epicurean herd, the Stoic, and the rest, each of them as far\r\nas in them lay, went about to seize the heritage he left, and were\r\ndragging me off protesting and resisting, as their booty, they tore in\r\npieces the garment which I had woven with my own hands, and, clutching\r\nthe torn pieces, went off, believing that the whole of me had passed\r\ninto their possession. And some of them, because some traces of my\r\nvesture were seen upon them, were destroyed through the mistake of the\r\nlewd multitude, who falsely deemed them to be my disciples. It may be\r\nthou knowest not of the banishment of Anaxagoras, of the poison draught\r\nof Socrates, nor of Zeno's torturing, because these things happened in\r\na distant country; yet mightest thou have learnt the fate of Arrius, of\r\nSeneca, of Soranus, whose stories are neither old nor unknown to fame.\r\nThese men were brought to destruction for no other reason than that,\r\nsettled as they were in my principles, their lives were a manifest\r\ncontrast to the ways of the wicked. So there is nothing thou shouldst\r\nwonder at, if on the seas of this life we are tossed by storm-blasts,\r\nseeing that we have made it our chiefest aim to refuse compliance with\r\nevil-doers. And though, maybe, the host of the wicked is many in number,\r\nyet is it contemptible, since it is under no leadership, but is hurried\r\nhither and thither at the blind driving of mad error. And if at times\r\nand seasons they set in array against us, and fall on in overwhelming\r\nstrength, our leader draws off her forces into the citadel while they\r\nare busy plundering the useless baggage. But we from our vantage ground,\r\nsafe from all this wild work, laugh to see them making prize of the most\r\nvalueless of things, protected by a bulwark which aggressive folly may\r\nnot aspire to reach.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG IV.\r\n\r\nNOTHING CAN SUBDUE VIRTUE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Whoso calm, serene, sedate,\r\n    Sets his foot on haughty fate;\r\n    Firm and steadfast, come what will,\r\n    Keeps his mien unconquered still;\r\n    Him the rage of furious seas,\r\n    Tossing high wild menaces,\r\n    Nor the flames from smoky forges\r\n    That Vesuvius disgorges,\r\n    Nor the bolt that from the sky\r\n    Smites the tower, can terrify.\r\n    Why, then, shouldst thou feel affright\r\n    At the tyrant's weakling might?\r\n    Dread him not, nor fear no harm,\r\n    And thou shall his rage disarm;\r\n    But who to hope or fear gives way--\r\n    Lost his bosom's rightful sway--\r\n    He hath cast away his shield,\r\n    Like a coward fled the field;\r\n    He hath forged all unaware\r\n    Fetters his own neck must bear!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Dost thou understand?' she asks. Do my words sink into thy mind? Or art\r\nthou dull \"as the ass to the sound of the lyre\"? Why dost thou weep? Why\r\ndo tears stream from thy eyes?\r\n\r\n    '\"Speak out, hide it not in thy heart.\"\r\n\r\nIf thou lookest for the physician's help, thou must needs disclose thy\r\nwound.'\r\n\r\nThen I, gathering together what strength I could, began: 'Is there still\r\nneed of telling? Is not the cruelty of fortune against me plain enough?\r\nDoth not the very aspect of this place move thee? Is this the library,\r\nthe room which thou hadst chosen as thy constant resort in my home, the\r\nplace where we so often sat together and held discourse of all things in\r\nheaven and earth? Was my garb and mien like this when I explored with\r\nthee nature's hid secrets, and thou didst trace for me with thy wand\r\nthe courses of the stars, moulding the while my character and the whole\r\nconduct of my life after the pattern of the celestial order? Is this the\r\nrecompense of my obedience? Yet thou hast enjoined by Plato's mouth the\r\nmaxim, \"that states would be happy, either if philosophers ruled them,\r\nor if it should so befall that their rulers would turn philosophers.\" By\r\nhis mouth likewise thou didst point out this imperative reason why\r\nphilosophers should enter public life, to wit, lest, if the reins of\r\ngovernment be left to unprincipled and profligate citizens, trouble and\r\ndestruction should come upon the good. Following these precepts, I have\r\ntried to apply in the business of public administration the principles\r\nwhich I learnt from thee in leisured seclusion. Thou art my witness and\r\nthat divinity who hath implanted thee in the hearts of the wise, that I\r\nbrought to my duties no aim but zeal for the public good. For this cause\r\nI have become involved in bitter and irreconcilable feuds, and, as\r\nhappens inevitably, if a man holds fast to the independence of\r\nconscience, I have had to think nothing of giving offence to the\r\npowerful in the cause of justice. How often have I encountered and\r\nbalked Conigastus in his assaults on the fortunes of the weak? How often\r\nhave I thwarted Trigguilla, steward of the king's household, even when\r\nhis villainous schemes were as good as accomplished? How often have I\r\nrisked my position and influence to protect poor wretches from the false\r\ncharges innumerable with which they were for ever being harassed by the\r\ngreed and license of the barbarians? No one has ever drawn me aside from\r\njustice to oppression. When ruin was overtaking the fortunes of the\r\nprovincials through the combined pressure of private rapine and public\r\ntaxation, I grieved no less than the sufferers. When at a season of\r\ngrievous scarcity a forced sale, disastrous as it was unjustifiable, was\r\nproclaimed, and threatened to overwhelm Campania with starvation, I\r\nembarked on a struggle with the prætorian prefect in the public\r\ninterest, I fought the case at the king's judgment-seat, and succeeded\r\nin preventing the enforcement of the sale. I rescued the consular\r\nPaulinus from the gaping jaws of the court bloodhounds, who in their\r\ncovetous hopes had already made short work of his wealth. To save\r\nAlbinus, who was of the same exalted rank, from the penalties of a\r\nprejudged charge, I exposed myself to the hatred of Cyprian, the\r\ninformer.\r\n\r\n'Thinkest thou I had laid up for myself store of enmities enough? Well,\r\nwith the rest of my countrymen, at any rate, my safety should have been\r\nassured, since my love of justice had left me no hope of security at\r\ncourt. Yet who was it brought the charges by which I have been struck\r\ndown? Why, one of my accusers is Basil, who, after being dismissed from\r\nthe king's household, was driven by his debts to lodge an information\r\nagainst my name. There is Opilio, there is Gaudentius, men who for many\r\nand various offences the king's sentence had condemned to banishment;\r\nand when they declined to obey, and sought to save themselves by taking\r\nsanctuary, the king, as soon as he heard of it, decreed that, if they\r\ndid not depart from the city of Ravenna within a prescribed time, they\r\nshould be branded on the forehead and expelled. What would exceed the\r\nrigour of this severity? And yet on that same day these very men lodged\r\nan information against me, and the information was admitted. Just\r\nHeaven! had I deserved this by my way of life? Did it make them fit\r\naccusers that my condemnation was a foregone conclusion? Has fortune no\r\nshame--if not at the accusation of the innocent, at least for the\r\nvileness of the accusers? Perhaps thou wonderest what is the sum of the\r\ncharges laid against me? I wished, they say, to save the senate. But\r\nhow? I am accused of hindering an informer from producing evidence to\r\nprove the senate guilty of treason. Tell me, then, what is thy counsel,\r\nO my mistress. Shall I deny the charge, lest I bring shame on thee? But\r\nI did wish it, and I shall never cease to wish it. Shall I admit it?\r\nThen the work of thwarting the informer will come to an end. Shall I\r\ncall the wish for the preservation of that illustrious house a crime?\r\nOf a truth the senate, by its decrees concerning me, has made it such!\r\nBut blind folly, though it deceive itself with false names, cannot alter\r\nthe true merits of things, and, mindful of the precept of Socrates, I do\r\nnot think it right either to keep the truth concealed or allow falsehood\r\nto pass. But this, however it may be, I leave to thy judgment and to the\r\nverdict of the discerning. Moreover, lest the course of events and the\r\ntrue facts should be hidden from posterity, I have myself committed to\r\nwriting an account of the transaction.\r\n\r\n'What need to speak of the forged letters by which an attempt is made to\r\nprove that I hoped for the freedom of Rome? Their falsity would have\r\nbeen manifest, if I had been allowed to use the confession of the\r\ninformers themselves, evidence which has in all matters the most\r\nconvincing force. Why, what hope of freedom is left to us? Would there\r\nwere any! I should have answered with the epigram of Canius when\r\nCaligula declared him to have been cognisant of a conspiracy against\r\nhim. \"If I had known,\" said he, \"thou shouldst never have known.\" Grief\r\nhath not so blunted my perceptions in this matter that I should complain\r\nbecause impious wretches contrive their villainies against the virtuous,\r\nbut at their achievement of their hopes I do exceedingly marvel. For\r\nevil purposes are, perchance, due to the imperfection of human nature;\r\nthat it should be possible for scoundrels to carry out their worst\r\nschemes against the innocent, while God beholdeth, is verily monstrous.\r\nFor this cause, not without reason, one of thy disciples asked, \"If God\r\nexists, whence comes evil? Yet whence comes good, if He exists not?\"\r\nHowever, it might well be that wretches who seek the blood of all honest\r\nmen and of the whole senate should wish to destroy me also, whom they\r\nsaw to be a bulwark of the senate and all honest men. But did I deserve\r\nsuch a fate from the Fathers also? Thou rememberest, methinks--since\r\nthou didst ever stand by my side to direct what I should do or say--thou\r\nrememberest, I say, how at Verona, when the king, eager for the general\r\ndestruction, was bent on implicating the whole senatorial order in the\r\ncharge of treason brought against Albinus, with what indifference to my\r\nown peril I maintained the innocence of its members, one and all. Thou\r\nknowest that what I say is the truth, and that I have never boasted of\r\nmy good deeds in a spirit of self-praise. For whenever a man by\r\nproclaiming his good deeds receives the recompense of fame, he\r\ndiminishes in a measure the secret reward of a good conscience. What\r\nissues have overtaken my innocency thou seest. Instead of reaping the\r\nrewards of true virtue, I undergo the penalties of a guilt falsely laid\r\nto my charge--nay, more than this; never did an open confession of guilt\r\ncause such unanimous severity among the assessors, but that some\r\nconsideration, either of the mere frailty of human nature, or of\r\nfortune's universal instability, availed to soften the verdict of some\r\nfew. Had I been accused of a design to fire the temples, to slaughter\r\nthe priests with impious sword, of plotting the massacre of all honest\r\nmen, I should yet have been produced in court, and only punished on due\r\nconfession or conviction. Now for my too great zeal towards the senate I\r\nhave been condemned to outlawry and death, unheard and undefended, at a\r\ndistance of near five hundred miles away.[C] Oh, my judges, well do ye\r\ndeserve that no one should hereafter be convicted of a fault like mine!\r\n\r\n'Yet even my very accusers saw how honourable was the charge they\r\nbrought against me, and, in order to overlay it with some shadow of\r\nguilt, they falsely asserted that in the pursuit of my ambition I had\r\nstained my conscience with sacrilegious acts. And yet thy spirit,\r\nindwelling in me, had driven from the chamber of my soul all lust of\r\nearthly success, and with thine eye ever upon me, there could be no\r\nplace left for sacrilege. For thou didst daily repeat in my ear and\r\ninstil into my mind the Pythagorean maxim, \"Follow after God.\" It was\r\nnot likely, then, that I should covet the assistance of the vilest\r\nspirits, when thou wert moulding me to such an excellence as should\r\nconform me to the likeness of God. Again, the innocency of the inner\r\nsanctuary of my home, the company of friends of the highest probity, a\r\nfather-in-law revered at once for his pure character and his active\r\nbeneficence, shield me from the very suspicion of sacrilege.\r\nYet--atrocious as it is--they even draw credence for this charge from\r\n_thee_; I am like to be thought implicated in wickedness on this very\r\naccount, that I am imbued with _thy_ teachings and stablished in _thy_\r\nways. So it is not enough that my devotion to thee should profit me\r\nnothing, but thou also must be assailed by reason of the odium which I\r\nhave incurred. Verily this is the very crown of my misfortunes, that\r\nmen's opinions for the most part look not to real merit, but to the\r\nevent; and only recognise foresight where Fortune has crowned the issue\r\nwith her approval. Whereby it comes to pass that reputation is the first\r\nof all things to abandon the unfortunate. I remember with chagrin how\r\nperverse is popular report, how various and discordant men's judgments.\r\nThis only will I say, that the most crushing of misfortune's burdens is,\r\nthat as soon as a charge is fastened upon the unhappy, they are believed\r\nto have deserved their sufferings. I, for my part, who have been\r\nbanished from all life's blessings, stripped of my honours, stained in\r\nrepute, am punished for well-doing.\r\n\r\n'And now methinks I see the villainous dens of the wicked surging with\r\njoy and gladness, all the most recklessly unscrupulous threatening a new\r\ncrop of lying informations, the good prostrate with terror at my danger,\r\nevery ruffian incited by impunity to new daring and to success by the\r\nprofits of audacity, the guiltless not only robbed of their peace of\r\nmind, but even of all means of defence. Wherefore I would fain cry out:\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[C] The distance from Rome to Pavia, the place of Boethius'\r\nimprisonment, is 455 Roman miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG V.\r\n\r\nBOETHIUS' PRAYER.\r\n\r\n\r\n    'Builder of yon starry dome,\r\n      Thou that whirlest, throned eternal,\r\n    Heaven's swift globe, and, as they roam,\r\n      Guid'st the stars by laws supernal:\r\n        So in full-sphered splendour dight\r\n        Cynthia dims the lamps of night,\r\n      But unto the orb fraternal\r\n        Closer drawn,[D] doth lose her light.\r\n\r\n    'Who at fall of eventide,\r\n      Hesper, his cold radiance showeth,\r\n    Lucifer his beams doth hide,\r\n      Paling as the sun's light groweth,\r\n        Brief, while winter's frost holds sway,\r\n        By thy will the space of day;\r\n      Swift, when summer's fervour gloweth,\r\n        Speed the hours of night away.\r\n\r\n    'Thou dost rule the changing year:\r\n      When rude Boreas oppresses,\r\n    Fall the leaves; they reappear,\r\n      Wooed by Zephyr's soft caresses.\r\n        Fields that Sirius burns deep grown\r\n        By Arcturus' watch were sown:\r\n      Each the reign of law confesses,\r\n        Keeps the place that is his own.\r\n\r\n    'Sovereign Ruler, Lord of all!\r\n      Can it be that Thou disdainest\r\n    Only man?

But how far distant that exile I should not know, had not\r\nthine own speech revealed it. Yet how far indeed from thy country hast\r\nthou, not been banished, but rather hast strayed; or, if thou wilt have\r\nit banishment, hast banished thyself! For no one else could ever\r\nlawfully have had this power over thee. Now, if thou wilt call to mind\r\nfrom what country thou art sprung, it is not ruled, as once was the\r\nAthenian polity, by the sovereignty of the multitude, but \"one is its\r\nRuler, one its King,\" who takes delight in the number of His citizens,\r\nnot in their banishment; to submit to whose governance and to obey\r\nwhose ordinances is perfect freedom. Art thou ignorant of that most\r\nancient law of this thy country, whereby it is decreed that no one\r\nwhatsoever, who hath chosen to fix there his dwelling, may be sent into\r\nexile? For truly there is no fear that one who is encompassed by its\r\nramparts and defences should deserve to be exiled. But he who has ceased\r\nto wish to dwell therein, he likewise ceases to deserve to do so. And so\r\nit is not so much the aspect of this place which moves me, as thy\r\naspect; not so much the library walls set off with glass and ivory which\r\nI miss, as the chamber of thy mind, wherein I once placed, not books,\r\nbut that which gives books their value, the doctrines which my books\r\ncontain. Now, what thou hast said of thy services to the commonweal is\r\ntrue, only too little compared with the greatness of thy deservings. The\r\nthings laid to thy charge whereof thou hast spoken, whether such as\r\nredound to thy credit, or mere false accusations, are publicly known. As\r\nfor the crimes and deceits of the informers, thou hast rightly deemed\r\nit fitting to pass them over lightly, because the popular voice hath\r\nbetter and more fully pronounced upon them. Thou hast bitterly\r\ncomplained of the injustice of the senate. Thou hast grieved over my\r\ncalumniation, and likewise hast lamented the damage to my good name.\r\nFinally, thine indignation blazed forth against fortune; thou hast\r\ncomplained of the unfairness with which thy merits have been\r\nrecompensed. Last of all thy frantic muse framed a prayer that the peace\r\nwhich reigns in heaven might rule earth also. But since a throng of\r\ntumultuous passions hath assailed thy soul, since thou art distraught\r\nwith anger, pain, and grief, strong remedies are not proper for thee in\r\nthis thy present mood. And so for a time I will use milder methods, that\r\nthe tumours which have grown hard through the influx of disturbing\r\npassion may be softened by gentle treatment, till they can bear the\r\nforce of sharper remedies.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG VI.\r\n\r\nALL THINGS HAVE THEIR NEEDFUL ORDER\r\n\r\n\r\n    He who to th' unwilling furrows\r\n      Gives the generous grain,\r\n    When the Crab with baleful fervours\r\n      Scorches all the plain;\r\n    He shall find his garner bare,\r\n    Acorns for his scanty fare.\r\n\r\n    Go not forth to cull sweet violets\r\n      From the purpled steep,\r\n    While the furious blasts of winter\r\n      Through the valleys sweep;\r\n    Nor the grape o'erhasty bring\r\n    To the press in days of spring.\r\n\r\n    For to each thing God hath given\r\n      Its appointed time;\r\n    No perplexing change permits He\r\n      In His plan sublime.\r\n    So who quits the order due\r\n    Shall a luckless issue rue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n'First, then, wilt thou suffer me by a few questions to make some\r\nattempt to test the state of thy mind, that I may learn in what way to\r\nset about thy cure?'\r\n\r\n'Ask what thou wilt,' said I, 'for I will answer whatever questions thou\r\nchoosest to put.'\r\n\r\nThen said she: 'This world of ours--thinkest thou it is governed\r\nhaphazard and fortuitously, or believest thou that there is in it any\r\nrational guidance?'\r\n\r\n'Nay,' said I, 'in no wise may I deem that such fixed motions can be\r\ndetermined by random hazard, but I know that God, the Creator, presideth\r\nover His work, nor will the day ever come that shall drive me from\r\nholding fast the truth of this belief.'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said she; 'thou didst even but now affirm it in song, lamenting\r\nthat men alone had no portion in the divine care. As to the rest, thou\r\nwert unshaken in the belief that they were ruled by reason. Yet I\r\nmarvel exceedingly how, in spite of thy firm hold on this opinion, thou\r\nart fallen into sickness. But let us probe more deeply: something or\r\nother is missing, I think. Now, tell me, since thou doubtest not that\r\nGod governs the world, dost thou perceive by what means He rules it?'\r\n\r\n'I scarcely understand what thou meanest,' I said, 'much less can I\r\nanswer thy question.'\r\n\r\n'Did I not say truly that something is missing, whereby, as through a\r\nbreach in the ramparts, disease hath crept in to disturb thy mind? But,\r\ntell me, dost thou remember the universal end towards which the aim of\r\nall nature is directed?'\r\n\r\n'I once heard,' said I, 'but sorrow hath dulled my recollection.'\r\n\r\n'And yet thou knowest whence all things have proceeded.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, that I know,' said I, 'and have answered that it is from God.'\r\n\r\n'Yet how is it possible that thou knowest not what is the end of\r\nexistence, when thou dost understand its source and origin? However,\r\nthese disturbances of mind have force to shake a man's position, but\r\ncannot pluck him up and root him altogether out of himself. But answer\r\nthis also, I pray thee: rememberest thou that thou art a man?'\r\n\r\n'How should I not?' said I.\r\n\r\n'Then, canst thou say what man is?'\r\n\r\n'Is this thy question: Whether I know myself for a being endowed with\r\nreason and subject to death? Surely I do acknowledge myself such.'\r\n\r\nThen she: 'Dost know nothing else that thou art?'\r\n\r\n'Nothing.'\r\n\r\n'Now,' said she, 'I know another cause of thy disease, one, too, of\r\ngrave moment. Thou hast ceased to know thy own nature. So, then, I have\r\nmade full discovery both of the causes of thy sickness and the means of\r\nrestoring thy health. It is because forgetfulness of thyself hath\r\nbewildered thy mind that thou hast bewailed thee as an exile, as one\r\nstripped of the blessings that were his; it is because thou knowest not\r\nthe end of existence that thou deemest abominable and wicked men to be\r\nhappy and powerful; while, because thou hast forgotten by what means the\r\nearth is governed, thou deemest that fortune's changes ebb and flow\r\nwithout the restraint of a guiding hand. These are serious enough to\r\ncause not sickness only, but even death; but, thanks be to the Author of\r\nour health, the light of nature hath not yet left thee utterly. In thy\r\ntrue judgment concerning the world's government, in that thou believest\r\nit subject, not to the random drift of chance, but to divine reason, we\r\nhave the divine spark from which thy recovery may be hoped. Have, then,\r\nno fear; from these weak embers the vital heat shall once more be\r\nkindled within thee. But seeing that it is not yet time for strong\r\nremedies, and that the mind is manifestly so constituted that when it\r\ncasts off true opinions it straightway puts on false, wherefrom arises a\r\ncloud of confusion that disturbs its true vision, I will now try and\r\ndisperse these mists by mild and soothing application, that so the\r\ndarkness of misleading passion may be scattered, and thou mayst come to\r\ndiscern the splendour of the true light.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG VII.\r\n\r\nTHE PERTURBATIONS OF PASSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Stars shed no light\r\n      Through the black night,\r\n        When the clouds hide;\r\n    And the lashed wave,\r\n      If the winds rave\r\n        O'er ocean's tide,--\r\n\r\n    Though once serene\r\n      As day's fair sheen,--\r\n        Soon fouled and spoiled\r\n    By the storm's spite,\r\n      Shows to the sight\r\n        Turbid and soiled.\r\n\r\n    Oft the fair rill,\r\n      Down the steep hill\r\n        Seaward that strays,\r\n    Some tumbled block\r\n      Of fallen rock\r\n        Hinders and stays.\r\n\r\n    Then art thou fain\r\n      Clear and most plain\r\n        Truth to discern,\r\n    In the right way\r\n      Firmly to stay,\r\n        Nor from it turn?\r\n\r\n    Joy, hope and fear\r\n      Suffer not near,\r\n        Drive grief away:\r\n    Shackled and blind\r\n      And lost is the mind\r\n        Where these have sway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\nTHE VANITY OF FORTUNE'S GIFTS\r\n\r\n\r\n     Summary\r\n\r\n     CH. I. Philosophy reproves Boethius for the foolishness of his\r\n     complaints against Fortune. Her very nature is caprice.--CH. II.\r\n     Philosophy in Fortune's name replies to Boethius' reproaches, and\r\n     proves that the gifts of Fortune are hers to give and to take\r\n     away.--CH. III. Boethius falls back upon his present sense of\r\n     misery. Philosophy reminds him of the brilliancy of his former\r\n     fortunes.--CH. IV. Boethius objects that the memory of past\r\n     happiness is the bitterest portion of the lot of the unhappy.\r\n     Philosophy shows that much is still left for which he may be\r\n     thankful. None enjoy perfect satisfaction with their lot. But\r\n     happiness depends not on anything which Fortune can give. It is to\r\n     be sought within.--CH. V. All the gifts of Fortune are external;\r\n     they can never truly be our own. Man cannot find his good in\r\n     worldly possessions. Riches bring anxiety and trouble.--CH. VI.\r\n     High place without virtue is an evil, not a good. Power is an empty\r\n     name.--CH. VII. Fame is a thing of little account when compared\r\n     with the immensity of the Universe and the endlessness of\r\n     Time.--CH. VIII. One service only can Fortune do, when she reveals\r\n     her own nature and distinguishes true friends from false.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThereafter for awhile she remained silent; and when she had restored my\r\nflagging attention by a moderate pause in her discourse, she thus began:\r\n'If I have thoroughly ascertained the character and causes of thy\r\nsickness, thou art pining with regretful longing for thy former fortune.\r\nIt is the change, as thou deemest, of this fortune that hath so wrought\r\nupon thy mind. Well do I understand that Siren's manifold wiles, the\r\nfatal charm of the friendship she pretends for her victims, so long as\r\nshe is scheming to entrap them--how she unexpectedly abandons them and\r\nleaves them overwhelmed with insupportable grief. Bethink thee of her\r\nnature, character, and deserts, and thou wilt soon acknowledge that in\r\nher thou hast neither possessed, nor hast thou lost, aught of any worth.\r\nMethinks I need not spend much pains in bringing this to thy mind,\r\nsince, even when she was still with thee, even while she was caressing\r\nthee, thou usedst to assail her in manly terms, to rebuke her, with\r\nmaxims drawn from my holy treasure-house. But all sudden changes of\r\ncircumstances bring inevitably a certain commotion of spirit. Thus it\r\nhath come to pass that thou also for awhile hast been parted from thy\r\nmind's tranquillity. But it is time for thee to take and drain a\r\ndraught, soft and pleasant to the taste, which, as it penetrates within,\r\nmay prepare the way for stronger potions. Wherefore I call to my aid the\r\nsweet persuasiveness of Rhetoric, who then only walketh in the right way\r\nwhen she forsakes not my instructions, and Music, my handmaid, I bid to\r\njoin with her singing, now in lighter, now in graver strain.\r\n\r\n'What is it, then, poor mortal, that hath cast thee into lamentation and\r\nmourning? Some strange, unwonted sight, methinks, have thine eyes seen.\r\nThou deemest Fortune to have changed towards thee; thou mistakest. Such\r\never were her ways, ever such her nature. Rather in her very mutability\r\nhath she preserved towards thee her true constancy. Such was she when\r\nshe loaded thee with caresses, when she deluded thee with the\r\nallurements of a false happiness. Thou hast found out how changeful is\r\nthe face of the blind goddess. She who still veils herself from others\r\nhath fully discovered to thee her whole character. If thou likest her,\r\ntake her as she is, and do not complain. If thou abhorrest her perfidy,\r\nturn from her in disdain, renounce her, for baneful are her delusions.\r\nThe very thing which is now the cause of thy great grief ought to have\r\nbrought thee tranquillity. Thou hast been forsaken by one of whom no one\r\ncan be sure that she will not forsake him. Or dost thou indeed set value\r\non a happiness that is certain to depart? Again I ask, Is Fortune's\r\npresence dear to thee if she cannot be trusted to stay, and though she\r\nwill bring sorrow when she is gone? Why, if she cannot be kept at\r\npleasure, and if her flight overwhelms with calamity, what is this\r\nfleeting visitant but a token of coming trouble? Truly it is not enough\r\nto look only at what lies before the eyes; wisdom gauges the issues of\r\nthings, and this same mutability, with its two aspects, makes the\r\nthreats of Fortune void of terror, and her caresses little to be\r\ndesired. Finally, thou oughtest to bear with whatever takes place within\r\nthe boundaries of Fortune's demesne, when thou hast placed thy head\r\nbeneath her yoke. But if thou wishest to impose a law of staying and\r\ndeparting on her whom thou hast of thine own accord chosen for thy\r\nmistress, art thou not acting wrongfully, art thou not embittering by\r\nimpatience a lot which thou canst not alter? Didst thou commit thy sails\r\nto the winds, thou wouldst voyage not whither thy intention was to go,\r\nbut whither the winds drave thee; didst thou entrust thy seed to the\r\nfields, thou wouldst set off the fruitful years against the barren. Thou\r\nhast resigned thyself to the sway of Fortune; thou must submit to thy\r\nmistress's caprices. What! art thou verily striving to stay the swing\r\nof the revolving wheel? Oh, stupidest of mortals, if it takes to\r\nstanding still, it ceases to be the wheel of Fortune.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG I.\r\n\r\nFORTUNE'S MALICE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mad Fortune sweeps along in wanton pride,\r\n    Uncertain as Euripus' surging tide;\r\n    Now tramples mighty kings beneath her feet;\r\n    Now sets the conquered in the victor's seat.\r\n    She heedeth not the wail of hapless woe,\r\n    But mocks the griefs that from her mischief flow.\r\n    Such is her sport; so proveth she her power;\r\n    And great the marvel, when in one brief hour\r\n    She shows her darling lifted high in bliss,\r\n    Then headlong plunged in misery's abyss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Now I would fain also reason with thee a little in Fortune's own words.\r\nDo thou observe whether her contentions be just. \"Man,\" she might say,\r\n\"why dost thou pursue me with thy daily complainings? What wrong have I\r\ndone thee? What goods of thine have I taken from thee? Choose an thou\r\nwilt a judge, and let us dispute before him concerning the rightful\r\nownership of wealth and rank. If thou succeedest in showing that any one\r\nof these things is the true property of mortal man, I freely grant those\r\nthings to be thine which thou claimest. When nature brought thee forth\r\nout of thy mother's womb, I took thee, naked and destitute as thou wast,\r\nI cherished thee with my substance, and, in the partiality of my favour\r\nfor thee, I brought thee up somewhat too indulgently, and this it is\r\nwhich now makes thee rebellious against me. I surrounded thee with a\r\nroyal abundance of all those things that are in my power. Now it is my\r\npleasure to draw back my hand. Thou hast reason to thank me for the use\r\nof what was not thine own; thou hast no right to complain, as if thou\r\nhadst lost what was wholly thine. Why, then, dost bemoan thyself? I have\r\ndone thee no violence. Wealth, honour, and all such things are placed\r\nunder my control. My handmaidens know their mistress; with me they come,\r\nand at my going they depart. I might boldly affirm that if those things\r\nthe loss of which thou lamentest had been thine, thou couldst never have\r\nlost them. Am I alone to be forbidden to do what I will with my own?\r\nUnrebuked, the skies now reveal the brightness of day, now shroud the\r\ndaylight in the darkness of night; the year may now engarland the face\r\nof the earth with flowers and fruits, now disfigure it with storms and\r\ncold. The sea is permitted to invite with smooth and tranquil surface\r\nto-day, to-morrow to roughen with wave and storm. Shall man's insatiate\r\ngreed bind _me_ to a constancy foreign to my character? This is my art,\r\nthis the game I never cease to play. I turn the wheel that spins. I\r\ndelight to see the high come down and the low ascend. Mount up, if thou\r\nwilt, but only on condition that thou wilt not think it a hardship to\r\ncome down when the rules of my game require it. Wert thou ignorant of my\r\ncharacter? Didst not know how Croesus, King of the Lydians, erstwhile\r\nthe dreaded rival of Cyrus, was afterwards pitiably consigned to the\r\nflame of the pyre, and only saved by a shower sent from heaven? Has it\r\n'scaped thee how Paullus paid a meed of pious tears to the misfortunes\r\nof King Perseus, his prisoner? What else do tragedies make such woeful\r\noutcry over save the overthrow of kingdoms by the indiscriminate strokes\r\nof Fortune? Didst thou not learn in thy childhood how there stand at the\r\nthreshold of Zeus 'two jars,' 'the one full of blessings, the other of\r\ncalamities'? How if thou hast drawn over-liberally from the good jar?\r\nWhat if not even now have I departed wholly from thee? What if this very\r\nmutability of mine is a just ground for hoping better things? But listen\r\nnow, and cease to let thy heart consume away with fretfulness, nor\r\nexpect to live on thine own terms in a realm that is common to all.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG II.\r\n\r\nMAN'S COVETOUSNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    What though Plenty pour her gifts\r\n      With a lavish hand,\r\n    Numberless as are the stars,\r\n      Countless as the sand,\r\n    Will the race of man, content,\r\n    Cease to murmur and lament?\r\n\r\n    Nay, though God, all-bounteous, give\r\n      Gold at man's desire--\r\n    Honours, rank, and fame--content\r\n      Not a whit is nigher;\r\n    But an all-devouring greed\r\n    Yawns with ever-widening need.\r\n\r\n    Then what bounds can e'er restrain\r\n      This wild lust of having,\r\n    When with each new bounty fed\r\n      Grows the frantic craving?\r\n    He is never rich whose fear\r\n    Sees grim Want forever near.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n'If Fortune should plead thus against thee, assuredly thou wouldst not\r\nhave one word to offer in reply; or, if thou canst find any\r\njustification of thy complainings, thou must show what it is. I will\r\ngive thee space to speak.'\r\n\r\nThen said I: 'Verily, thy pleas are plausible--yea, steeped in the\r\nhoneyed sweetness of music and rhetoric. But their charm lasts only\r\nwhile they are sounding in the ear; the sense of his misfortunes lies\r\ndeeper in the heart of the wretched. So, when the sound ceases to\r\nvibrate upon the air, the heart's indwelling sorrow is felt with renewed\r\nbitterness.'\r\n\r\nThen said she: 'It is indeed as thou sayest, for we have not yet come to\r\nthe curing of thy sickness; as yet these are but lenitives conducing to\r\nthe treatment of a malady hitherto obstinate. The remedies which go deep\r\nI will apply in due season. Nevertheless, to deprecate thy\r\ndetermination to be thought wretched, I ask thee, Hast thou forgotten\r\nthe extent and bounds of thy felicity? I say nothing of how, when\r\norphaned and desolate, thou wast taken into the care of illustrious men;\r\nhow thou wast chosen for alliance with the highest in the state--and\r\neven before thou wert bound to their house by marriage, wert already\r\ndear to their love--which is the most precious of all ties. Did not all\r\npronounce thee most happy in the virtues of thy wife, the splendid\r\nhonours of her father, and the blessing of male issue? I pass over--for\r\nI care not to speak of blessings in which others also have shared--the\r\ndistinctions often denied to age which thou enjoyedst in thy youth. I\r\nchoose rather to come to the unparalleled culmination of thy good\r\nfortune. If the fruition of any earthly success has weight in the scale\r\nof happiness, can the memory of that splendour be swept away by any\r\nrising flood of troubles? That day when thou didst see thy two sons ride\r\nforth from home joint consuls, followed by a train of senators, and\r\nwelcomed by the good-will of the people; when these two sat in curule\r\nchairs in the Senate-house, and thou by thy panegyric on the king didst\r\nearn the fame of eloquence and ability; when in the Circus, seated\r\nbetween the two consuls, thou didst glut the multitude thronging around\r\nwith the triumphal largesses for which they looked--methinks thou didst\r\ncozen Fortune while she caressed thee, and made thee her darling. Thou\r\ndidst bear off a boon which she had never before granted to any private\r\nperson. Art thou, then, minded to cast up a reckoning with Fortune? Now\r\nfor the first time she has turned a jealous glance upon thee. If thou\r\ncompare the extent and bounds of thy blessings and misfortunes, thou\r\ncanst not deny that thou art still fortunate. Or if thou esteem not\r\nthyself favoured by Fortune in that thy then seeming prosperity hath\r\ndeparted, deem not thyself wretched, since what thou now believest to be\r\ncalamitous passeth also. What! art thou but now come suddenly and a\r\nstranger to the scene of this life? Thinkest thou there is any stability\r\nin human affairs, when man himself vanishes away in the swift course of\r\ntime? It is true that there is little trust that the gifts of chance\r\nwill abide; yet the last day of life is in a manner the death of all\r\nremaining Fortune. What difference, then, thinkest thou, is there,\r\nwhether thou leavest her by dying, or she leave thee by fleeing away?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG III.\r\n\r\nALL PASSES.\r\n\r\n\r\n    When, in rosy chariot drawn,\r\n    Phoebus 'gins to light the dawn,\r\n    By his flaming beams assailed,\r\n    Every glimmering star is paled.\r\n    When the grove, by Zephyrs fed,\r\n    With rose-blossom blushes red;--\r\n    Doth rude Auster breathe thereon,\r\n    Bare it stands, its glory gone.\r\n    Smooth and tranquil lies the deep\r\n    While the winds are hushed in sleep.\r\n    Soon, when angry tempests lash,\r\n    Wild and high the billows dash.\r\n    Thus if Nature's changing face\r\n    Holds not still a moment's space,\r\n    Fleeting deem man's fortunes; deem\r\n    Bliss as transient as a dream.\r\n    One law only standeth fast:\r\n    Things created may not last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen said I: 'True are thine admonishings, thou nurse of all excellence;\r\nnor can I deny the wonder of my fortune's swift career. Yet it is this\r\nwhich chafes me the more cruelly in the recalling. For truly in adverse\r\nfortune the worst sting of misery is to _have been_ happy.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' said she, 'if thou art paying the penalty of a mistaken belief,\r\nthou canst not rightly impute the fault to circumstances. If it is the\r\nfelicity which Fortune gives that moves thee--mere name though it\r\nbe--come reckon up with me how rich thou art in the number and\r\nweightiness of thy blessings. Then if, by the blessing of Providence,\r\nthou hast still preserved unto thee safe and inviolate that which,\r\nhowsoever thou mightest reckon thy fortune, thou wouldst have thought\r\nthy most precious possession, what right hast thou to talk of\r\nill-fortune whilst keeping all Fortune's better gifts? Yet Symmachus,\r\nthy wife's father--a man whose splendid character does honour to the\r\nhuman race--is safe and unharmed; and while he bewails thy wrongs, this\r\nrare nature, in whom wisdom and virtue are so nobly blended, is himself\r\nout of danger--a boon thou wouldst have been quick to purchase at the\r\nprice of life itself. Thy wife yet lives, with her gentle disposition,\r\nher peerless modesty and virtue--this the epitome of all her graces,\r\nthat she is the true daughter of her sire--she lives, I say, and for thy\r\nsake only preserves the breath of life, though she loathes it, and pines\r\naway in grief and tears for thy absence, wherein, if in naught else, I\r\nwould allow some marring of thy felicity. What shall I say of thy sons\r\nand their consular dignity--how in them, so far as may be in youths of\r\ntheir age, the example of their father's and grandfather's character\r\nshines out? Since, then, the chief care of mortal man is to preserve his\r\nlife, how happy art thou, couldst thou but recognise thy blessings, who\r\npossessest even now what no one doubts to be dearer than life!\r\nWherefore, now dry thy tears. Fortune's hate hath not involved all thy\r\ndear ones; the stress of the storm that has assailed thee is not beyond\r\nmeasure intolerable, since there are anchors still holding firm which\r\nsuffer thee not to lack either consolation in the present or hope for\r\nthe future.'\r\n\r\n'I pray that they still may hold. For while they still remain, however\r\nthings may go, I shall ride out the storm. Yet thou seest how much is\r\nshorn of the splendour of my fortunes.'\r\n\r\n'We are gaining a little ground,' said she, 'if there is something in\r\nthy lot wherewith thou art not yet altogether discontented. But I cannot\r\nstomach thy daintiness when thou complainest with such violence of grief\r\nand anxiety because thy happiness falls short of completeness. Why, who\r\nenjoys such settled felicity as not to have some quarrel with the\r\ncircumstances of his lot? A troublous matter are the conditions of human\r\nbliss; either they are never realized in full, or never stay\r\npermanently. One has abundant riches, but is shamed by his ignoble\r\nbirth. Another is conspicuous for his nobility, but through the\r\nembarrassments of poverty would prefer to be obscure. A third, richly\r\nendowed with both, laments the loneliness of an unwedded life. Another,\r\nthough happily married, is doomed to childlessness, and nurses his\r\nwealth for a stranger to inherit. Yet another, blest with children,\r\nmournfully bewails the misdeeds of son or daughter. Wherefore, it is not\r\neasy for anyone to be at perfect peace with the circumstances of his\r\nlot. There lurks in each several portion something which they who\r\nexperience it not know nothing of, but which makes the sufferer wince.\r\nBesides, the more favoured a man is by Fortune, the more fastidiously\r\nsensitive is he; and, unless all things answer to his whim, he is\r\noverwhelmed by the most trifling misfortunes, because utterly unschooled\r\nin adversity. So petty are the trifles which rob the most fortunate of\r\nperfect happiness! How many are there, dost thou imagine, who would\r\nthink themselves nigh heaven, if but a small portion from the wreck of\r\nthy fortune should fall to them? This very place which thou callest\r\nexile is to them that dwell therein their native land. So true is it\r\nthat nothing is wretched, but thinking makes it so, and conversely every\r\nlot is happy if borne with equanimity. Who is so blest by Fortune as not\r\nto wish to change his state, if once he gives rein to a rebellious\r\nspirit? With how many bitternesses is the sweetness of human felicity\r\nblent! And even if that sweetness seem to him to bring delight in the\r\nenjoying, yet he cannot keep it from departing when it will. How\r\nmanifestly wretched, then, is the bliss of earthly fortune, which lasts\r\nnot for ever with those whose temper is equable, and can give no perfect\r\nsatisfaction to the anxious-minded!\r\n\r\n'Why, then, ye children of mortality, seek ye from without that\r\nhappiness whose seat is only within us? Error and ignorance bewilder\r\nyou. I will show thee, in brief, the hinge on which perfect happiness\r\nturns. Is there anything more precious to thee than thyself? Nothing,\r\nthou wilt say. If, then, thou art master of thyself, thou wilt possess\r\nthat which thou wilt never be willing to lose, and which Fortune cannot\r\ntake from thee. And that thou mayst see that happiness cannot possibly\r\nconsist in these things which are the sport of chance, reflect that, if\r\nhappiness is the highest good of a creature living in accordance with\r\nreason, and if a thing which can in any wise be reft away is not the\r\nhighest good, since that which cannot be taken away is better than it,\r\nit is plain that Fortune cannot aspire to bestow happiness by reason of\r\nits instability. And, besides, a man borne along by this transitory\r\nfelicity must either know or not know its unstability. If he knows not,\r\nhow poor is a happiness which depends on the blindness of ignorance! If\r\nhe knows it, he needs must fear to lose a happiness whose loss he\r\nbelieves to be possible. Wherefore, a never-ceasing fear suffers him not\r\nto be happy. Or does he count the possibility of this loss a trifling\r\nmatter? Insignificant, then, must be the good whose loss can be borne so\r\nequably. And, further, I know thee to be one settled in the belief that\r\nthe souls of men certainly die not with them, and convinced thereof by\r\nnumerous proofs; it is clear also that the felicity which Fortune\r\nbestows is brought to an end with the death of the body: therefore, it\r\ncannot be doubted but that, if happiness is conferred in this way, the\r\nwhole human race sinks into misery when death brings the close of all.\r\nBut if we know that many have sought the joy of happiness not through\r\ndeath only, but also through pain and suffering, how can life make men\r\nhappy by its presence when it makes them not wretched by its loss?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG IV.\r\n\r\nTHE GOLDEN MEAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Who founded firm and sure\r\n    Would ever live secure,\r\n    In spite of storm and blast\r\n    Immovable and fast;\r\n    Whoso would fain deride\r\n    The ocean's threatening tide;--\r\n    His dwelling should not seek\r\n    On sands or mountain-peak.\r\n    Upon the mountain's height\r\n    The storm-winds wreak their spite:\r\n    The shifting sands disdain\r\n    Their burden to sustain.\r\n    Do thou these perils flee,\r\n    Fair though the prospect be,\r\n    And fix thy resting-place\r\n    On some low rock's sure base.\r\n    Then, though the tempests roar,\r\n    Seas thunder on the shore,\r\n    Thou in thy stronghold blest\r\n    And undisturbed shalt rest;\r\n    Live all thy days serene,\r\n    And mock the heavens' spleen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n\r\n'But since my reasonings begin to work a soothing effect within thy\r\nmind, methinks I may resort to remedies somewhat stronger. Come,\r\nsuppose, now, the gifts of Fortune were not fleeting and transitory,\r\nwhat is there in them capable of ever becoming truly thine, or which\r\ndoes not lose value when looked at steadily and fairly weighed in the\r\nbalance? Are riches, I pray thee, precious either through thy nature or\r\nin their own? What are they but mere gold and heaps of money? Yet these\r\nfine things show their quality better in the spending than in the\r\nhoarding; for I suppose 'tis plain that greed Alva's makes men hateful,\r\nwhile liberality brings fame. But that which is transferred to another\r\ncannot remain in one's own possession; and if that be so, then money is\r\nonly precious when it is given away, and, by being transferred to\r\nothers, ceases to be one's own. Again, if all the money in the world\r\nwere heaped up in one man's possession, all others would be made poor.\r\nSound fills the ears of many at the same time without being broken into\r\nparts, but your riches cannot pass to many without being lessened in the\r\nprocess. And when this happens, they must needs impoverish those whom\r\nthey leave. How poor and cramped a thing, then, is riches, which more\r\nthan one cannot possess as an unbroken whole, which falls not to any one\r\nman's lot without the impoverishment of everyone else! Or is it the\r\nglitter of gems that allures the eye? Yet, how rarely excellent soever\r\nmay be their splendour, remember the flashing light is in the jewels,\r\nnot in the man. Indeed, I greatly marvel at men's admiration of them;\r\nfor what can rightly seem beautiful to a being endowed with life and\r\nreason, if it lack the movement and structure of life? And although such\r\nthings do in the end take on them more beauty from their Maker's care\r\nand their own brilliancy, still they in no wise merit your admiration\r\nsince their excellence is set at a lower grade than your own.\r\n\r\n'Does the beauty of the fields delight you? Surely, yes; it is a\r\nbeautiful part of a right beautiful whole. Fitly indeed do we at times\r\nenjoy the serene calm of the sea, admire the sky, the stars, the moon,\r\nthe sun. Yet is any of these thy concern? Dost thou venture to boast\r\nthyself of the beauty of any one of them? Art _thou_ decked with\r\nspring's flowers? is it _thy_ fertility that swelleth in the fruits of\r\nautumn? Why art thou moved with empty transports? why embracest thou an\r\nalien excellence as thine own? Never will fortune make thine that which\r\nthe nature of things has excluded from thy ownership. Doubtless the\r\nfruits of the earth are given for the sustenance of living creatures.\r\nBut if thou art content to supply thy wants so far as suffices nature,\r\nthere is no need to resort to fortune's bounty. Nature is content with\r\nfew things, and with a very little of these. If thou art minded to force\r\nsuperfluities upon her when she is satisfied, that which thou addest\r\nwill prove either unpleasant or harmful. But, now, thou thinkest it\r\nfine to shine in raiment of divers colours; yet--if, indeed, there is\r\nany pleasure in the sight of such things--it is the texture or the\r\nartist's skill which I shall admire.\r\n\r\n'Or perhaps it is a long train of servants that makes thee happy? Why,\r\nif they behave viciously, they are a ruinous burden to thy house, and\r\nexceeding dangerous to their own master; while if they are honest, how\r\ncanst thou count other men's virtue in the sum of thy possessions? From\r\nall which 'tis plainly proved that not one of these things which thou\r\nreckonest in the number of thy possessions is really thine. And if there\r\nis in them no beauty to be desired, why shouldst thou either grieve for\r\ntheir loss or find joy in their continued possession? While if they are\r\nbeautiful in their own nature, what is that to thee? They would have\r\nbeen not less pleasing in themselves, though never included among thy\r\npossessions. For they derive not their preciousness from being counted\r\nin thy riches, but rather thou hast chosen to count them in thy riches\r\nbecause they seemed to thee precious.\r\n\r\n'Then, what seek ye by all this noisy outcry about fortune? To chase\r\naway poverty, I ween, by means of abundance. And yet ye find the result\r\njust contrary. Why, this varied array of precious furniture needs more\r\naccessories for its protection; it is a true saying that they want most\r\nwho possess most, and, conversely, they want very little who measure\r\ntheir abundance by nature's requirements, not by the superfluity of vain\r\ndisplay. Have ye no good of your own implanted within you, that ye seek\r\nyour good in things external and separate? Is the nature of things so\r\nreversed that a creature divine by right of reason can in no other way\r\nbe splendid in his own eyes save by the possession of lifeless chattels?\r\nYet, while other things are content with their own, ye who in your\r\nintellect are God-like seek from the lowest of things adornment for a\r\nnature of supreme excellence, and perceive not how great a wrong ye do\r\nyour Maker. His will was that mankind should excel all things on earth.\r\nYe thrust down your worth beneath the lowest of things. For if that in\r\nwhich each thing finds its good is plainly more precious than that whose\r\ngood it is, by your own estimation ye put yourselves below the vilest of\r\nthings, when ye deem these vile things to be your good: nor does this\r\nfall out undeservedly. Indeed, man is so constituted that he then only\r\nexcels other things when he knows himself; but he is brought lower than\r\nthe beasts if he lose this self-knowledge. For that other creatures\r\nshould be ignorant of themselves is natural; in man it shows as a\r\ndefect. How extravagant, then, is this error of yours, in thinking that\r\nanything can be embellished by adornments not its own. It cannot be. For\r\nif such accessories add any lustre, it is the accessories that get the\r\npraise, while that which they veil and cover remains in its pristine\r\nugliness. And again I say, That is no _good_, which injures its\r\npossessor. Is this untrue? No, quite true, thou sayest. And yet riches\r\nhave often hurt those that possessed them, since the worst of men, who\r\nare all the more covetous by reason of their wickedness, think none but\r\nthemselves worthy to possess all the gold and gems the world contains.\r\nSo thou, who now dreadest pike and sword, mightest have trolled a carol\r\n\"in the robber's face,\" hadst thou entered the road of life with empty\r\npockets. Oh, wondrous blessedness of perishable wealth, whose\r\nacquisition robs thee of security!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG V.\r\n\r\nTHE FORMER AGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Too blest the former age, their life\r\n      Who in the fields contented led,\r\n    And still, by luxury unspoiled,\r\n      On frugal acorns sparely fed.\r\n\r\n    No skill was theirs the luscious grape\r\n      With honey's sweetness to confuse;\r\n    Nor China's soft and sheeny silks\r\n      T' empurple with brave Tyrian hues.\r\n\r\n    The grass their wholesome couch, their drink\r\n      The stream, their roof the pine's tall shade;\r\n    Not theirs to cleave the deep, nor seek\r\n      In strange far lands the spoils of trade.\r\n\r\n    The trump of war was heard not yet,\r\n      Nor soiled the fields by bloodshed's stain;\r\n    For why should war's fierce madness arm\r\n      When strife brought wound, but brought not gain?\r\n\r\n    Ah! would our hearts might still return\r\n      To following in those ancient ways.\r\n    Alas! the greed of getting glows\r\n      More fierce than Etna's fiery blaze.\r\n\r\n    Woe, woe for him, whoe'er it was,\r\n      Who first gold's hidden store revealed,\r\n    And--perilous treasure-trove--dug out\r\n      The gems that fain would be concealed!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n'What now shall I say of rank and power, whereby, because ye know not\r\ntrue power and dignity, ye hope to reach the sky? Yet, when rank and\r\npower have fallen to the worst of men, did ever an Etna, belching forth\r\nflame and fiery deluge, work such mischief? Verily, as I think, thou\r\ndost remember how thine ancestors sought to abolish the consular power,\r\nwhich had been the foundation of their liberties, on account of the\r\noverweening pride of the consuls, and how for that self-same pride they\r\nhad already abolished the kingly title! And if, as happens but rarely,\r\nthese prerogatives are conferred on virtuous men, it is only the virtue\r\nof those who exercise them that pleases. So it appears that honour\r\ncometh not to virtue from rank, but to rank from virtue. Look, too, at\r\nthe nature of that power which ye find so attractive and glorious! Do ye\r\nnever consider, ye creatures of earth, what ye are, and over whom ye\r\nexercise your fancied lordship? Suppose, now, that in the mouse tribe\r\nthere should rise up one claiming rights and powers for himself above\r\nthe rest, would ye not laugh consumedly? Yet if thou lookest to his body\r\nalone, what creature canst thou find more feeble than man, who\r\noftentimes is killed by the bite of a fly, or by some insect creeping\r\ninto the inner passage of his system! Yet what rights can one exercise\r\nover another, save only as regards the body, and that which is lower\r\nthan the body--I mean fortune? What! wilt thou bind with thy mandates\r\nthe free spirit? Canst thou force from its due tranquillity the mind\r\nthat is firmly composed by reason? A tyrant thought to drive a man of\r\nfree birth to reveal his accomplices in a conspiracy, but the prisoner\r\nbit off his tongue and threw it into the furious tyrant's face; thus,\r\nthe tortures which the tyrant thought the instrument of his cruelty the\r\nsage made an opportunity for heroism. Moreover, what is there that one\r\nman can do to another which he himself may not have to undergo in his\r\nturn? We are told that Busiris, who used to kill his guests, was himself\r\nslain by his guest, Hercules. Regulus had thrown into bonds many of the\r\nCarthaginians whom he had taken in war; soon after he himself submitted\r\nhis hands to the chains of the vanquished. Then, thinkest thou that man\r\nhath any power who cannot prevent another's being able to do to him what\r\nhe himself can do to others?\r\n\r\n'Besides, if there were any element of natural and proper good in rank\r\nand power, they would never come to the utterly bad, since opposites are\r\nnot wont to be associated. Nature brooks not the union of contraries.\r\nSo, seeing there is no doubt that wicked wretches are oftentimes set in\r\nhigh places, it is also clear that things which suffer association with\r\nthe worst of men cannot be good in their own nature. Indeed, this\r\njudgment may with some reason be passed concerning all the gifts of\r\nfortune which fall so plentifully to all the most wicked. This ought\r\nalso to be considered here, I think: No one doubts a man to be brave in\r\nwhom he has observed a brave spirit residing. It is plain that one who\r\nis endowed with speed is swift-footed. So also music makes men musical,\r\nthe healing art physicians, rhetoric public speakers. For each of these\r\nhas naturally its own proper working; there is no confusion with the\r\neffects of contrary things--nay, even of itself it rejects what is\r\nincompatible. And yet wealth cannot extinguish insatiable greed, nor has\r\npower ever made him master of himself whom vicious lusts kept bound in\r\nindissoluble fetters; dignity conferred on the wicked not only fails to\r\nmake them worthy, but contrarily reveals and displays their\r\nunworthiness. Why does it so happen? Because ye take pleasure in calling\r\nby false names things whose nature is quite incongruous thereto--by\r\nnames which are easily proved false by the very effects of the things\r\nthemselves; even so it is; these riches, that power, this dignity, are\r\nnone of them rightly so called. Finally, we may draw the same conclusion\r\nconcerning the whole sphere of Fortune, within which there is plainly\r\nnothing to be truly desired, nothing of intrinsic excellence; for she\r\nneither always joins herself to the good, nor does she make good men of\r\nthose to whom she is united.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG VI.\r\n\r\nNERO'S INFAMY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    We know what mischief dire he wrought--\r\n      Rome fired, the Fathers slain--\r\n    Whose hand with brother's slaughter wet\r\n      A mother's blood did stain.\r\n\r\n    No pitying tear his cheek bedewed,\r\n      As on the corse he gazed;\r\n    That mother's beauty, once so fair,\r\n      A critic's voice appraised.\r\n\r\n    Yet far and wide, from East to West,\r\n      His sway the nations own;\r\n    And scorching South and icy North\r\n      Obey his will alone.\r\n\r\n    Did, then, high power a curb impose\r\n      On Nero's phrenzied will?\r\n    Ah, woe when to the evil heart\r\n      Is joined the sword to kill!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen said I: 'Thou knowest thyself that ambition for worldly success\r\nhath but little swayed me. Yet I have desired opportunity for action,\r\nlest virtue, in default of exercise, should languish away.'\r\n\r\nThen she: 'This is that \"last infirmity\" which is able to allure minds\r\nwhich, though of noble quality, have not yet been moulded to any\r\nexquisite refinement by the perfecting of the virtues--I mean, the love\r\nof glory--and fame for high services rendered to the commonweal. And yet\r\nconsider with me how poor and unsubstantial a thing this glory is! The\r\nwhole of this earth's globe, as thou hast learnt from the demonstration\r\nof astronomy, compared with the expanse of heaven, is found no bigger\r\nthan a point; that is to say, if measured by the vastness of heaven's\r\nsphere, it is held to occupy absolutely no space at all. Now, of this so\r\ninsignificant portion of the universe, it is about a fourth part, as\r\nPtolemy's proofs have taught us, which is inhabited by living creatures\r\nknown to us. If from this fourth part you take away in thought all that\r\nis usurped by seas and marshes, or lies a vast waste of waterless\r\ndesert, barely is an exceeding narrow area left for human habitation.\r\nYou, then, who are shut in and prisoned in this merest fraction of a\r\npoint's space, do ye take thought for the blazoning of your fame, for\r\nthe spreading abroad of your renown? Why, what amplitude or magnificence\r\nhas glory when confined to such narrow and petty limits?\r\n\r\n'Besides, the straitened bounds of this scant dwelling-place are\r\ninhabited by many nations differing widely in speech, in usages, in mode\r\nof life; to many of these, from the difficulty of travel, from\r\ndiversities of speech, from want of commercial intercourse, the fame not\r\nonly of individual men, but even of cities, is unable to reach. Why, in\r\nCicero's days, as he himself somewhere points out, the fame of the Roman\r\nRepublic had not yet crossed the Caucasus, and yet by that time her\r\nname had grown formidable to the Parthians and other nations of those\r\nparts. Seest thou, then, how narrow, how confined, is the glory ye take\r\npains to spread abroad and extend! Can the fame of a single Roman\r\npenetrate where the glory of the Roman name fails to pass? Moreover, the\r\ncustoms and institutions of different races agree not together, so that\r\nwhat is deemed praise worthy in one country is thought punishable in\r\nanother. Wherefore, if any love the applause of fame, it shall not\r\nprofit him to publish his name among many peoples. Then, each must be\r\ncontent to have the range of his glory limited to his own people; the\r\nsplendid immortality of fame must be confined within the bounds of a\r\nsingle race.\r\n\r\n'Once more, how many of high renown in their own times have been lost in\r\noblivion for want of a record! Indeed, of what avail are written records\r\neven, which, with their authors, are overtaken by the dimness of age\r\nafter a somewhat longer time? But ye, when ye think on future fame,\r\nfancy it an immortality that ye are begetting for yourselves. Why, if\r\nthou scannest the infinite spaces of eternity, what room hast thou left\r\nfor rejoicing in the durability of thy name? Verily, if a single\r\nmoment's space be compared with ten thousand years, it has a certain\r\nrelative duration, however little, since each period is definite. But\r\nthis same number of years--ay, and a number many times as great--cannot\r\neven be compared with endless duration; for, indeed, finite periods may\r\nin a sort be compared one with another, but a finite and an infinite\r\nnever. So it comes to pass that fame, though it extend to ever so wide a\r\nspace of years, if it be compared to never-lessening eternity, seems not\r\nshort-lived merely, but altogether nothing. But as for you, ye know not\r\nhow to act aright, unless it be to court the popular breeze, and win the\r\nempty applause of the multitude--nay, ye abandon the superlative worth\r\nof conscience and virtue, and ask a recompense from the poor words of\r\nothers. Let me tell thee how wittily one did mock the shallowness of\r\nthis sort of arrogance. A certain man assailed one who had put on the\r\nname of philosopher as a cloak to pride and vain-glory, not for the\r\npractice of real virtue, and added: \"Now shall I know if thou art a\r\nphilosopher if thou bearest reproaches calmly and patiently.\" The other\r\nfor awhile affected to be patient, and, having endured to be abused,\r\ncried out derisively: \"_Now_, do you see that I am a philosopher?\" The\r\nother, with biting sarcasm, retorted: \"I should have hadst thou held thy\r\npeace.\" Moreover, what concern have choice spirits--for it is of such\r\nmen we speak, men who seek glory by virtue--what concern, I say, have\r\nthese with fame after the dissolution of the body in death's last hour?\r\nFor if men die wholly--which our reasonings forbid us to believe--there\r\nis no such thing as glory at all, since he to whom the glory is said to\r\nbelong is altogether non-existent. But if the mind, conscious of its own\r\nrectitude, is released from its earthly prison, and seeks heaven in free\r\nflight, doth it not despise all earthly things when it rejoices in its\r\ndeliverance from earthly bonds, and enters upon the joys of heaven?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG VII.\r\n\r\nGLORY MAY NOT LAST.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Oh, let him, who pants for glory's guerdon,\r\n      Deeming glory all in all,\r\n    Look and see how wide the heaven expandeth,\r\n      Earth's enclosing bounds how small!\r\n\r\n    Shame it is, if your proud-swelling glory\r\n      May not fill this narrow room!\r\n    Why, then, strive so vainly, oh, ye proud ones!\r\n      To escape your mortal doom?\r\n\r\n    Though your name, to distant regions bruited,\r\n      O'er the earth be widely spread,\r\n    Though full many a lofty-sounding title\r\n      On your house its lustre shed,\r\n\r\n    Death at all this pomp and glory spurneth\r\n      When his hour draweth nigh,\r\n    Shrouds alike th' exalted and the humble,\r\n      Levels lowest and most high.\r\n\r\n    Where are now the bones of stanch Fabricius?\r\n      Brutus, Cato--where are they?\r\n    Lingering fame, with a few graven letters,\r\n      Doth their empty name display.\r\n\r\n    But to know the great dead is not given\r\n      From a gilded name alone;\r\n    Nay, ye all alike must lie forgotten,\r\n      'Tis not _you_ that fame makes known.\r\n\r\n    Fondly do ye deem life's little hour\r\n      Lengthened by fame's mortal breath;\r\n    There but waits you--when this, too, is taken--\r\n      At the last a second death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n'But that thou mayst not think that I wage implacable warfare against\r\nFortune, I own there is a time when the deceitful goddess serves men\r\nwell--I mean when she reveals herself, uncovers her face, and confesses\r\nher true character. Perhaps thou dost not yet grasp my meaning. Strange\r\nis the thing I am trying to express, and for this cause I can scarce\r\nfind words to make clear my thought. For truly I believe that Ill\r\nFortune is of more use to men than Good Fortune. For Good Fortune, when\r\nshe wears the guise of happiness, and most seems to caress, is always\r\nlying; Ill Fortune is always truthful, since, in changing, she shows her\r\ninconstancy. The one deceives, the other teaches; the one enchains the\r\nminds of those who enjoy her favour by the semblance of delusive good,\r\nthe other delivers them by the knowledge of the frail nature of\r\nhappiness. Accordingly, thou mayst see the one fickle, shifting as the\r\nbreeze, and ever self-deceived; the other sober-minded, alert, and wary,\r\nby reason of the very discipline of adversity. Finally, Good Fortune, by\r\nher allurements, draws men far from the true good; Ill Fortune ofttimes\r\ndraws men back to true good with grappling-irons. Again, should it be\r\nesteemed a trifling boon, thinkest thou, that this cruel, this odious\r\nFortune hath discovered to thee the hearts of thy faithful friends--that\r\nother hid from thee alike the faces of the true friends and of the\r\nfalse, but in departing she hath taken away _her_ friends, and left thee\r\n_thine_? What price wouldst thou not have given for this service in the\r\nfulness of thy prosperity when thou seemedst to thyself fortunate?\r\nCease, then, to seek the wealth thou hast lost, since in true friends\r\nthou hast found the most precious of all riches.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG VIII.\r\n\r\nLOVE IS LORD OF ALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Why are Nature's changes bound\r\n    To a fixed and ordered round?\r\n    What to leaguèd peace hath bent\r\n    Every warring element?\r\n    Wherefore doth the rosy morn\r\n    Rise on Phoebus' car upborne?\r\n    Why should Phoebe rule the night,\r\n    Led by Hesper's guiding light?\r\n    What the power that doth restrain\r\n    In his place the restless main,\r\n    That within fixed bounds he keeps,\r\n    Nor o'er earth in deluge sweeps?\r\n    Love it is that holds the chains,\r\n    Love o'er sea and earth that reigns;\r\n    Love--whom else but sovereign Love?--\r\n    Love, high lord in heaven above!\r\n    Yet should he his care remit,\r\n    All that now so close is knit\r\n    In sweet love and holy peace,\r\n    Would no more from conflict cease,\r\n    But with strife's rude shock and jar\r\n    All the world's fair fabric mar.\r\n\r\n    Tribes and nations Love unites\r\n    By just treaty's sacred rites;\r\n    Wedlock's bonds he sanctifies\r\n    By affection's softest ties.\r\n    Love appointeth, as is due,\r\n    Faithful laws to comrades true--\r\n    Love, all-sovereign Love!--oh, then,\r\n    Ye are blest, ye sons of men,\r\n    If the love that rules the sky\r\n    In your hearts is throned on high!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\nTRUE HAPPINESS AND FALSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     SUMMARY\r\n\r\n     CH. I. Boethius beseeches Philosophy to continue. She promises to\r\n     lead him to true happiness.--CH. II. Happiness is the one end which\r\n     all created beings seek. They aim variously at (_a_) wealth, or\r\n     (_b_) rank, or (_c_) sovereignty, or (_d_) glory, or (_e_)\r\n     pleasure, because they think thereby to attain either (_a_)\r\n     contentment, (_b_) reverence, (_c_) power, (_d_) renown, or (_e_)\r\n     gladness of heart, in one or other of which they severally imagine\r\n     happiness to consist.--CH. III. Philosophy proceeds to consider\r\n     whether happiness can really be secured in any of these ways, (_a_)\r\n     So far from bringing contentment, riches only add to men's\r\n     wants.--CH. IV. (_b_) High position cannot of itself win respect.\r\n     Titles command no reverence in distant and barbarous lands. They\r\n     even fall into contempt through lapse of time.--CH. V. (_c_)\r\n     Sovereignty cannot even bestow safety. History tells of the\r\n     downfall of kings and their ministers. Tyrants go in fear of their\r\n     lives. --CH. VI. (_d_) Fame conferred on the unworthy is but\r\n     disgrace. The splendour of noble birth is not a man's own, but his\r\n     ancestors'.--CH. VII. (_e_) Pleasure begins in the restlessness of\r\n     desire, and ends in repentance. Even the pure pleasures of home may\r\n     turn to gall and bitterness.--CH. VIII. All fail, then, to give\r\n     what they promise. There is, moreover, some accompanying evil\r\n     involved in each of these aims. Beauty and bodily strength are\r\n     likewise of little worth. In strength man is surpassed by the\r\n     brutes; beauty is but outward show.--CH. IX. The source of men's\r\n     error in following these phantoms of good is that _they break up\r\n     and separate that which is in its nature one and indivisible_.\r\n     Contentment, power, reverence, renown, and joy are essentially\r\n     bound up one with the other, and, if they are to be attained at\r\n     all, must be attained _together_. True happiness, if it can be\r\n     found, will include them all. But it cannot be found among the\r\n     perishable things hitherto considered.--CH. X. Such a happiness\r\n     necessarily exists. Its seat is in God. Nay, God is very happiness,\r\n     and in a manner, therefore, the happy man partakes also of the\r\n     Divine nature. All other ends are relative to this good, since they\r\n     are all pursued only for the sake of good; it is _good_ which is\r\n     the sole ultimate end. And since the sole end is also happiness, it\r\n     is plain that this good and happiness are in essence the same.--CH.\r\n     XI. Unity is another aspect of goodness. Now, all things subsist so\r\n     long only as they preserve the unity of their being; when they lose\r\n     this unity, they perish. But the bent of nature forces all things\r\n     (plants and inanimate things, as well as animals) to strive to\r\n     continue in life. Therefore, all things desire unity, for unity is\r\n     essential to life. But unity and goodness were shown to be the\r\n     same. Therefore, good is proved to be the end towards which the\r\n     whole universe tends.[E]--CH. XII. Boethius acknowledges that he is\r\n     but recollecting truths he once knew. Philosophy goes on to show\r\n     that it is goodness also by which the whole world is governed.[F]\r\n     Boethius professes compunction for his former folly. But the\r\n     paradox of evil is introduced, and he is once more perplexed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[E] This solves the second of the points left in doubt at the end of bk.\r\ni., ch. vi.\r\n\r\n[F] This solves the third. No distinct account is given of the first,\r\nbut an answer may be gathered from the general argument of bks. ii.,\r\niii., and iv.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe ceased, but I stood fixed by the sweetness of the song in wonderment\r\nand eager expectation, my ears still strained to listen. And then after\r\na little I said: 'Thou sovereign solace of the stricken soul, what\r\nrefreshment hast thou brought me, no less by the sweetness of thy\r\nsinging than by the weightiness of thy discourse! Verily, I think not\r\nthat I shall hereafter be unequal to the blows of Fortune. Wherefore, I\r\nno longer dread the remedies which thou saidst were something too severe\r\nfor my strength; nay, rather, I am eager to hear of them and call for\r\nthem with all vehemence.'\r\n\r\nThen said she: 'I marked thee fastening upon my words silently and\r\nintently, and I expected, or--to speak more truly--I myself brought\r\nabout in thee, this state of mind. What now remains is of such sort that\r\nto the taste indeed it is biting, but when received within it turns to\r\nsweetness. But whereas thou dost profess thyself desirous of hearing,\r\nwith what ardour wouldst thou not burn didst thou but perceive whither\r\nit is my task to lead thee!'\r\n\r\n'Whither?' said I.\r\n\r\n'To true felicity,' said she, 'which even now thy spirit sees in dreams,\r\nbut cannot behold in very truth, while thine eyes are engrossed with\r\nsemblances.'\r\n\r\nThen said I: 'I beseech thee, do thou show to me her true shape without\r\na moment's loss.'\r\n\r\n'Gladly will I, for thy sake,' said she. 'But first I will try to sketch\r\nin words, and describe a cause which is more familiar to thee, that,\r\nwhen thou hast viewed this carefully, thou mayst turn thy eyes the other\r\nway, and recognise the beauty of true happiness.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG I.\r\n\r\nTHE THORNS OF ERROR.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Who fain would sow the fallow field,\r\n      And see the growing corn,\r\n    Must first remove the useless weeds,\r\n      The bramble and the thorn.\r\n\r\n    After ill savour, honey's taste\r\n      Is to the mouth more sweet;\r\n    After the storm, the twinkling stars\r\n      The eyes more cheerly greet.\r\n\r\n    When night hath past, the bright dawn comes\r\n      In car of rosy hue;\r\n    So drive the false bliss from thy mind,\r\n      And thou shall see the true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a little space she remained in a fixed gaze, withdrawn, as it were,\r\ninto the august chamber of her mind; then she thus began:\r\n\r\n'All mortal creatures in those anxious aims which find employment in so\r\nmany varied pursuits, though they take many paths, yet strive to reach\r\none goal--the goal of happiness. Now, _the good_ is that which, when a\r\nman hath got, he can lack nothing further. This it is which is the\r\nsupreme good of all, containing within itself all particular good; so\r\nthat if anything is still wanting thereto, this cannot be the supreme\r\ngood, since something would be left outside which might be desired. 'Tis\r\nclear, then, that happiness is a state perfected by the assembling\r\ntogether of all good things. To this state, as we have said, all men try\r\nto attain, but by different paths. For the desire of the true good is\r\nnaturally implanted in the minds of men; only error leads them aside out\r\nof the way in pursuit of the false. Some, deeming it the highest good to\r\nwant for nothing, spare no pains to attain affluence; others, judging\r\nthe good to be that to which respect is most worthily paid, strive to\r\nwin the reverence of their fellow-citizens by the attainment of official\r\ndignity. Some there are who fix the chief good in supreme power; these\r\neither wish themselves to enjoy sovereignty, or try to attach themselves\r\nto those who have it. Those, again, who think renown to be something of\r\nsupreme excellence are in haste to spread abroad the glory of their name\r\neither through the arts of war or of peace. A great many measure the\r\nattainment of good by joy and gladness of heart; these think it the\r\nheight of happiness to give themselves over to pleasure. Others there\r\nare, again, who interchange the ends and means one with the other in\r\ntheir aims; for instance, some want riches for the sake of pleasure and\r\npower, some covet power either for the sake of money or in order to\r\nbring renown to their name. So it is on these ends, then, that the aim\r\nof human acts and wishes is centred, and on others like to these--for\r\ninstance, noble birth and popularity, which seem to compass a certain\r\nrenown; wife and children, which are sought for the sweetness of their\r\npossession; while as for friendship, the most sacred kind indeed is\r\ncounted in the category of virtue, not of fortune; but other kinds are\r\nentered upon for the sake of power or of enjoyment. And as for bodily\r\nexcellences, it is obvious that they are to be ranged with the above.\r\nFor strength and stature surely manifest power; beauty and fleetness of\r\nfoot bring celebrity; health brings pleasure. It is plain, then, that\r\nthe only object sought for in all these ways is _happiness_. For that\r\nwhich each seeks in preference to all else, that is in his judgment the\r\nsupreme good. And we have defined the supreme good to be happiness.\r\nTherefore, that state which each wishes in preference to all others is\r\nin his judgment happy.\r\n\r\n'Thou hast, then, set before thine eyes something like a scheme of human\r\nhappiness--wealth, rank, power, glory, pleasure. Now Epicurus, from a\r\nsole regard to these considerations, with some consistency concluded the\r\nhighest good to be pleasure, because all the other objects seem to bring\r\nsome delight to the soul. But to return to human pursuits and aims:\r\nman's mind seeks to recover its proper good, in spite of the mistiness\r\nof its recollection, but, like a drunken man, knows not by what path to\r\nreturn home. Think you they are wrong who strive to escape want? Nay,\r\ntruly there is nothing which can so well complete happiness as a state\r\nabounding in all good things, needing nothing from outside, but wholly\r\nself-sufficing. Do they fall into error who deem that which is best to\r\nbe also best deserving to receive the homage of reverence? Not at all.\r\nThat cannot possibly be vile and contemptible, to attain which the\r\nendeavours of nearly all mankind are directed. Then, is power not to be\r\nreckoned in the category of good? Why, can that which is plainly more\r\nefficacious than anything else be esteemed a thing feeble and void of\r\nstrength? Or is renown to be thought of no account? Nay, it cannot be\r\nignored that the highest renown is constantly associated with the\r\nhighest excellence. And what need is there to say that happiness is not\r\nhaunted by care and gloom, nor exposed to trouble and vexation, since\r\nthat is a condition we ask of the very least of things, from the\r\npossession and enjoyment of which we expect delight? So, then, these are\r\nthe blessings men wish to win; they want riches, rank, sovereignty,\r\nglory, pleasure, because they believe that by these means they will\r\nsecure independence, reverence, power, renown, and joy of heart.\r\nTherefore, it is _the good_ which men seek by such divers courses; and\r\nherein is easily shown the might of Nature's power, since, although\r\nopinions are so various and discordant, yet they agree in cherishing\r\n_good_ as the end.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG II.\r\n\r\nTHE BENT OF NATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    How the might of Nature sways\r\n    All the world in ordered ways,\r\n    How resistless laws control\r\n    Each least portion of the whole--\r\n    Fain would I in sounding verse\r\n    On my pliant strings rehearse.\r\n\r\n    Lo, the lion captive ta'en\r\n    Meekly wears his gilded chain;\r\n    Yet though he by hand be fed,\r\n    Though a master's whip he dread,\r\n    If but once the taste of gore\r\n    Whet his cruel lips once more,\r\n    Straight his slumbering fierceness wakes,\r\n    With one roar his bonds he breaks,\r\n    And first wreaks his vengeful force\r\n    On his trainer's mangled corse.\r\n\r\n    And the woodland songster, pent\r\n    In forlorn imprisonment,\r\n    Though a mistress' lavish care\r\n    Store of honeyed sweets prepare;\r\n    Yet, if in his narrow cage,\r\n    As he hops from bar to bar,\r\n    He should spy the woods afar,\r\n    Cool with sheltering foliage,\r\n    All these dainties he will spurn,\r\n    To the woods his heart will turn;\r\n    Only for the woods he longs,\r\n    Pipes the woods in all his songs.\r\n\r\n    To rude force the sapling bends,\r\n    While the hand its pressure lends;\r\n    If the hand its pressure slack,\r\n    Straight the supple wood springs back.\r\n    Phoebus in the western main\r\n    Sinks; but swift his car again\r\n    By a secret path is borne\r\n    To the wonted gates of morn.\r\n\r\n    Thus are all things seen to yearn\r\n    In due time for due return;\r\n    And no order fixed may stay,\r\n    Save which in th' appointed way\r\n    Joins the end to the beginning\r\n    In a steady cycle spinning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Ye, too, creatures of earth, have some glimmering of your origin,\r\nhowever faint, and though in a vision dim and clouded, yet in some wise,\r\nnotwithstanding, ye discern the true end of happiness, and so the aim of\r\nnature leads you thither--to that true good--while error in many forms\r\nleads you astray therefrom. For reflect whether men are able to win\r\nhappiness by those means through which they think to reach the proposed\r\nend. Truly, if either wealth, rank, or any of the rest, bring with them\r\nanything of such sort as seems to have nothing wanting to it that is\r\ngood, we, too, acknowledge that some are made happy by the acquisition\r\nof these things. But if they are not able to fulfil their promises, and,\r\nmoreover, lack many good things, is not the happiness men seek in them\r\nclearly discovered to be a false show? Therefore do I first ask thee\r\nthyself, who but lately wert living in affluence, amid all that\r\nabundance of wealth, was thy mind never troubled in consequence of some\r\nwrong done to thee?'\r\n\r\n'Nay,' said I, 'I cannot ever remember a time when my mind was so\r\ncompletely at peace as not to feel the pang of some uneasiness.'\r\n\r\n'Was it not because either something was absent which thou wouldst not\r\nhave absent, or present which thou wouldst have away?'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said I.\r\n\r\n'Then, thou didst want the presence of the one, the absence of the\r\nother?'\r\n\r\n'Admitted.'\r\n\r\n'But a man lacks that of which he is in want?'\r\n\r\n'He does.'\r\n\r\n'And he who lacks something is not in all points self-sufficing?'\r\n\r\n'No; certainly not,' said I.\r\n\r\n'So wert thou, then, in the plenitude of thy wealth, supporting this\r\ninsufficiency?'\r\n\r\n'I must have been.'\r\n\r\n'Wealth, then, cannot make its possessor independent and free from all\r\nwant, yet this was what it seemed to promise. Moreover, I think this\r\nalso well deserves to be considered--that there is nothing in the\r\nspecial nature of money to hinder its being taken away from those who\r\npossess it against their will.'\r\n\r\n'I admit it.'\r\n\r\n'Why, of course, when every day the stronger wrests it from the weaker\r\nwithout his consent. Else, whence come lawsuits, except in seeking to\r\nrecover moneys which have been taken away against their owner's will by\r\nforce or fraud?'\r\n\r\n'True,' said I.\r\n\r\n'Then, everyone will need some extraneous means of protection to keep\r\nhis money safe.'\r\n\r\n'Who can venture to deny it?'\r\n\r\n'Yet he would not, unless he possessed the money which it is possible to\r\nlose.'\r\n\r\n'No; he certainly would not.'\r\n\r\n'Then, we have worked round to an opposite conclusion: the wealth which\r\nwas thought to make a man independent rather puts him in need of further\r\nprotection. How in the world, then, can want be driven away by riches?\r\nCannot the rich feel hunger? Cannot they thirst? Are not the limbs of\r\nthe wealthy sensitive to the winter's cold? \"But,\" thou wilt say, \"the\r\nrich have the wherewithal to sate their hunger, the means to get rid of\r\nthirst and cold.\" True enough; want can thus be soothed by riches,\r\nwholly removed it cannot be. For if this ever-gaping, ever-craving want\r\nis glutted by wealth, it needs must be that the want itself which can be\r\nso glutted still remains. I do not speak of how very little suffices for\r\nnature, and how for avarice nothing is enough. Wherefore, if wealth\r\ncannot get rid of want, and makes new wants of its own, how can ye\r\nbelieve that it bestows independence?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG III.\r\n\r\nTHE INSATIABLENESS OF AVARICE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Though the covetous grown wealthy\r\n      See his piles of gold rise high;\r\n    Though he gather store of treasure\r\n      That can never satisfy;\r\n    Though with pearls his gorget blazes,\r\n      Rarest that the ocean yields;\r\n    Though a hundred head of oxen\r\n      Travail in his ample fields;\r\n    Ne'er shall carking care forsake him\r\n      While he draws this vital breath,\r\n    And his riches go not with him,\r\n      When his eyes are closed in death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Well, but official dignity clothes him to whom it comes with honour and\r\nreverence! Have, then, offices of state such power as to plant virtue in\r\nthe minds of their possessors, and drive out vice? Nay, they are rather\r\nwont to signalize iniquity than to chase it away, and hence arises our\r\nindignation that honours so often fall to the most iniquitous of men.\r\nAccordingly, Catullus calls Nonius an \"ulcer-spot,\" though \"sitting in\r\nthe curule chair.\" Dost not see what infamy high position brings upon\r\nthe bad? Surely their unworthiness will be less conspicuous if their\r\nrank does not draw upon them the public notice! In thy own case, wouldst\r\nthou ever have been induced by all these perils to think of sharing\r\noffice with Decoratus, since thou hast discerned in him the spirit of a\r\nrascally parasite and informer? No; we cannot deem men worthy of\r\nreverence on account of their office, whom we deem unworthy of the\r\noffice itself. But didst thou see a man endued with wisdom, couldst thou\r\nsuppose him not worthy of reverence, nor of that wisdom with which he\r\nwas endued?'\r\n\r\n'No; certainly not.'\r\n\r\n'There is in Virtue a dignity of her own which she forthwith passes over\r\nto those to whom she is united. And since public honours cannot do this,\r\nit is clear that they do not possess the true beauty of dignity. And\r\nhere this well deserves to be noticed--that if a man is the more scorned\r\nin proportion as he is despised by a greater number, high position not\r\nonly fails to win reverence for the wicked, but even loads them the more\r\nwith contempt by drawing more attention to them. But not without\r\nretribution; for the wicked pay back a return in kind to the dignities\r\nthey put on by the pollution of their touch. Perhaps, too, another\r\nconsideration may teach thee to confess that true reverence cannot come\r\nthrough these counterfeit dignities. It is this: If one who had been\r\nmany times consul chanced to visit barbaric lands, would his office win\r\nhim the reverence of the barbarians? And yet if reverence were the\r\nnatural effect of dignities, they would not forego their proper function\r\nin any part of the world, even as fire never anywhere fails to give\r\nforth heat. But since this effect is not due to their own efficacy, but\r\nis attached to them by the mistaken opinion of mankind, they disappear\r\nstraightway when they are set before those who do not esteem them\r\ndignities. Thus the case stands with foreign peoples. But does their\r\nrepute last for ever, even in the land of their origin? Why, the\r\nprefecture, which was once a great power, is now an empty name--a burden\r\nmerely on the senator's fortune; the commissioner of the public corn\r\nsupply was once a personage--now what is more contemptible than this\r\noffice? For, as we said just now, that which hath no true comeliness of\r\nits own now receives, now loses, lustre at the caprice of those who have\r\nto do with it. So, then, if dignities cannot win men reverence, if they\r\nare actually sullied by the contamination of the wicked, if they lose\r\ntheir splendour through time's changes, if they come into contempt\r\nmerely for lack of public estimation, what precious beauty have they in\r\nthemselves, much less to give to others?'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG IV.\r\n\r\nDISGRACE OF HONOURS CONFERRED BY A TYRANT.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Though royal purple soothes his pride,\r\n      And snowy pearls his neck adorn,\r\n    Nero in all his riot lives\r\n      The mark of universal scorn.\r\n\r\n    Yet he on reverend heads conferred\r\n      Th' inglorious honours of the state.\r\n    Shall we, then, deem them truly blessed\r\n      Whom such preferment hath made great?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Well, then, does sovereignty and the intimacy of kings prove able to\r\nconfer power? Why, surely does not the happiness of kings endure for\r\never? And yet antiquity is full of examples, and these days also, of\r\nkings whose happiness has turned into calamity. How glorious a power,\r\nwhich is not even found effectual for its own preservation! But if\r\nhappiness has its source in sovereign power, is not happiness\r\ndiminished, and misery inflicted in its stead, in so far as that power\r\nfalls short of completeness? Yet, however widely human sovereignty be\r\nextended, there must still be more peoples left, over whom each several\r\nking holds no sway. Now, at whatever point the power on which happiness\r\ndepends ceases, here powerlessness steals in and makes wretchedness; so,\r\nby this way of reckoning, there must needs be a balance of wretchedness\r\nin the lot of the king. The tyrant who had made trial of the perils of\r\nhis condition figured the fears that haunt a throne under the image of a\r\nsword hanging over a man's head.[G] What sort of power, then, is this\r\nwhich cannot drive away the gnawings of anxiety, or shun the stings of\r\nterror? Fain would they themselves have lived secure, but they cannot;\r\nthen they boast about their power! Dost thou count him to possess power\r\nwhom thou seest to wish what he cannot bring to pass? Dost thou count\r\nhim to possess power who encompasses himself with a body-guard, who\r\nfears those he terrifies more than they fear him, who, to keep up the\r\nsemblance of power, is himself at the mercy of his slaves? Need I say\r\nanything of the friends of kings, when I show royal dominion itself so\r\nutterly and miserably weak--why ofttimes the royal power in its\r\nplenitude brings them low, ofttimes involves them in its fall? Nero\r\ndrove his friend and preceptor, Seneca, to the choice of the manner of\r\nhis death. Antoninus exposed Papinianus, who was long powerful at\r\ncourt, to the swords of the soldiery. Yet each of these was willing to\r\nrenounce his power. Seneca tried to surrender his wealth also to Nero,\r\nand go into retirement; but neither achieved his purpose. When they\r\ntottered, their very greatness dragged them down. What manner of thing,\r\nthen, is this power which keeps men in fear while they possess it--which\r\nwhen thou art fain to keep, thou art not safe, and when thou desirest to\r\nlay it aside thou canst not rid thyself of? Are friends any protection\r\nwho have been attached by fortune, not by virtue? Nay; him whom good\r\nfortune has made a friend, ill fortune will make an enemy. And what\r\nplague is more effectual to do hurt than a foe of one's own household?'\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[G] The sword of Damocles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG V.\r\n\r\nSELF-MASTERY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Who on power sets his aim,\r\n    First must his own spirit tame;\r\n    He must shun his neck to thrust\r\n    'Neath th' unholy yoke of lust.\r\n    For, though India's far-off land\r\n    Bow before his wide command,\r\n    Utmost Thule homage pay--\r\n    If he cannot drive away\r\n    Haunting care and black distress,\r\n    In his power, he's powerless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Again, how misleading, how base, a thing ofttimes is glory! Well does\r\nthe tragic poet exclaim:\r\n\r\n    '\"Oh, fond Repute, how many a time and oft\r\n    Hast them raised high in pride the base-born churl!\"\r\n\r\nFor many have won a great name through the mistaken beliefs of the\r\nmultitude--and what can be imagined more shameful than that? Nay, they\r\nwho are praised falsely must needs themselves blush at their own\r\npraises! And even when praise is won by merit, still, how does it add to\r\nthe good conscience of the wise man who measures his good not by popular\r\nrepute, but by the truth of inner conviction? And if at all it does seem\r\na fair thing to get this same renown spread abroad, it follows that any\r\nfailure so to spread it is held foul. But if, as I set forth but now,\r\nthere must needs be many tribes and peoples whom the fame of any single\r\nman cannot reach, it follows that he whom thou esteemest glorious seems\r\nall inglorious in a neighbouring quarter of the globe. As to popular\r\nfavour, I do not think it even worthy of mention in this place, since it\r\nnever cometh of judgment, and never lasteth steadily.\r\n\r\n'Then, again, who does not see how empty, how foolish, is the fame of\r\nnoble birth? Why, if the nobility is based on renown, the renown is\r\nanother's! For, truly, nobility seems to be a sort of reputation coming\r\nfrom the merits of ancestors. But if it is the praise which brings\r\nrenown, of necessity it is they who are praised that are famous.\r\nWherefore, the fame of another clothes thee not with splendour if thou\r\nhast none of thine own. So, if there is any excellence in nobility of\r\nbirth, methinks it is this alone--that it would seem to impose upon the\r\nnobly born the obligation not to degenerate from the virtue of their\r\nancestors.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG VI.\r\n\r\nTRUE NOBILITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    All men are of one kindred stock, though scattered far and wide;\r\n    For one is Father of us all--one doth for all provide.\r\n    He gave the sun his golden beams, the moon her silver horn;\r\n    He set mankind upon the earth, as stars the heavens adorn.\r\n    He shut a soul--a heaven-born soul--within the body's frame;\r\n    The noble origin he gave each mortal wight may claim.\r\n    Why boast ye, then, so loud of race and high ancestral line?\r\n    If ye behold your being's source, and God's supreme design,\r\n    None is degenerate, none base, unless by taint of sin\r\n    And cherished vice he foully stain his heavenly origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Then, what shall I say of the pleasures of the body? The lust thereof\r\nis full of uneasiness; the sating, of repentance. What sicknesses, what\r\nintolerable pains, are they wont to bring on the bodies of those who\r\nenjoy them--the fruits of iniquity, as it were! Now, what sweetness the\r\nstimulus of pleasure may have I do not know. But that the issues of\r\npleasure are painful everyone may understand who chooses to recall the\r\nmemory of his own fleshly lusts. Nay, if these can make happiness, there\r\nis no reason why the beasts also should not be happy, since all their\r\nefforts are eagerly set upon satisfying the bodily wants. I know,\r\nindeed, that the sweetness of wife and children should be right comely,\r\nyet only too true to nature is what was said of one--that he found in\r\nhis sons his tormentors. And how galling such a contingency would be, I\r\nmust needs put thee in mind, since thou hast never in any wise suffered\r\nsuch experiences, nor art thou now under any uneasiness. In such a case,\r\nI agree with my servant Euripides, who said that a man without children\r\nwas fortunate in his misfortune.'[H]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[H] Paley translates the lines in Euripides' 'Andromache': 'They [the\r\nchildless] are indeed spared from much pain and sorrow, but their\r\nsupposed happiness is after all but wretchedness.' Euripides' meaning is\r\ntherefore really just the reverse of that which Boethius makes it. See\r\nEuripides, 'Andromache,' Il. 418-420.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG VII.\r\n\r\nPLEASURE'S STING.\r\n\r\n\r\n        This is the way of Pleasure:\r\n    She stings them that despoil her;\r\n    And, like the wingéd toiler\r\n        Who's lost her honeyed treasure,\r\n      She flies, but leaves her smart\r\n      Deep-rankling in the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n'It is beyond doubt, then, that these paths do not lead to happiness;\r\nthey cannot guide anyone to the promised goal. Now, I will very briefly\r\nshow what serious evils are involved in following them. Just consider.\r\nIs it thy endeavour to heap up money? Why, thou must wrest it from its\r\npresent possessor! Art thou minded to put on the splendour of official\r\ndignity? Thou must beg from those who have the giving of it; thou who\r\ncovetest to outvie others in honour must lower thyself to the humble\r\nposture of petition. Dost thou long for power? Thou must face perils,\r\nfor thou wilt be at the mercy of thy subjects' plots. Is glory thy aim?\r\nThou art lured on through all manner of hardships, and there is an end\r\nto thy peace of mind. Art fain to lead a life of pleasure? Yet who does\r\nnot scorn and contemn one who is the slave of the weakest and vilest of\r\nthings--the body? Again, on how slight and perishable a possession do\r\nthey rely who set before themselves bodily excellences! Can ye ever\r\nsurpass the elephant in bulk or the bull in strength? Can ye excel the\r\ntiger in swiftness? Look upon the infinitude, the solidity, the swift\r\nmotion, of the heavens, and for once cease to admire things mean and\r\nworthless. And yet the heavens are not so much to be admired on this\r\naccount as for the reason which guides them. Then, how transient is the\r\nlustre of beauty! how soon gone!--more fleeting than the fading bloom of\r\nspring flowers. And yet if, as Aristotle says, men should see with the\r\neyes of Lynceus, so that their sight might pierce through obstructions,\r\nwould not that body of Alcibiades, so gloriously fair in outward\r\nseeming, appear altogether loathsome when all its inward parts lay open\r\nto the view? Therefore, it is not thy own nature that makes thee seem\r\nbeautiful, but the weakness of the eyes that see thee. Yet prize as\r\nunduly as ye will that body's excellences; so long as ye know that this\r\nthat ye admire, whatever its worth, can be dissolved away by the feeble\r\nflame of a three days' fever. From all which considerations we may\r\nconclude as a whole, that these things which cannot make good the\r\nadvantages they promise, which are never made perfect by the assemblage\r\nof all good things--these neither lead as by-ways to happiness, nor\r\nthemselves make men completely happy.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG VIII.\r\n\r\nHUMAN FOLLY.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Alas! how wide astray\r\n    Doth Ignorance these wretched mortals lead\r\n      From Truth's own way!\r\n      For not on leafy stems\r\n    Do ye within the green wood look for gold,\r\n      Nor strip the vine for gems;\r\n\r\n      Your nets ye do not spread\r\n    Upon the hill-tops, that the groaning board\r\n      With fish be furnishèd;\r\n      If ye are fain to chase\r\n    The bounding goat, ye sweep not in vain search\r\n      The ocean's ruffled face.\r\n\r\n      The sea's far depths they know,\r\n    Each hidden nook, wherein the waves o'erwash\r\n      The pearl as white as snow;\r\n      Where lurks the Tyrian shell,\r\n    Where fish and prickly urchins do abound,\r\n      All this they know full well.\r\n\r\n      But not to know or care\r\n    Where hidden lies the good all hearts desire--\r\n      This blindness they can bear;\r\n      With gaze on earth low-bent,\r\n    They seek for that which reacheth far beyond\r\n      The starry firmament.\r\n\r\n      What curse shall I call down\r\n    On hearts so dull? May they the race still run\r\n      For wealth and high renown!\r\n      And when with much ado\r\n    The false good they have grasped--ah, then too late!--\r\n      May they discern the true!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n'This much may well suffice to set forth the form of false happiness; if\r\nthis is now clear to thine eyes, the next step is to show what true\r\nhappiness is.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed,' said I, 'I see clearly enough that neither is independence to\r\nbe found in wealth, nor power in sovereignty, nor reverence in\r\ndignities, nor fame in glory, nor true joy in pleasures.'\r\n\r\n'Hast thou discerned also the causes why this is so?'\r\n\r\n'I seem to have some inkling, but I should like to learn more at large\r\nfrom thee.'\r\n\r\n'Why, truly the reason is hard at hand. _That which is simple and\r\nindivisible by nature human error separates_, and transforms from the\r\ntrue and perfect to the false and imperfect. Dost thou imagine that\r\nwhich lacketh nothing can want power?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly not.'\r\n\r\n'Right; for if there is any feebleness of strength in anything, in this\r\nthere must necessarily be need of external protection.'\r\n\r\n'That is so.'\r\n\r\n'Accordingly, the nature of independence and power is one and the same.'\r\n\r\n'It seems so.'\r\n\r\n'Well, but dost think that anything of such a nature as this can be\r\nlooked upon with contempt, or is it rather of all things most worthy of\r\nveneration?'\r\n\r\n'Nay; there can be no doubt as to that.'\r\n\r\n'Let us, then, add reverence to independence and power, and conclude\r\nthese three to be one.'\r\n\r\n'We must if we will acknowledge the truth.'\r\n\r\n'Thinkest thou, then, this combination of qualities to be obscure and\r\nwithout distinction, or rather famous in all renown? Just consider: can\r\nthat want renown which has been agreed to be lacking in nothing, to be\r\nsupreme in power, and right worthy of honour, for the reason that it\r\ncannot bestow this upon itself, and so comes to appear somewhat poor in\r\nesteem?'\r\n\r\n'I cannot but acknowledge that, being what it is, this union of\r\nqualities is also right famous.'\r\n\r\n'It follows, then, that we must admit that renown is not different from\r\nthe other three.'\r\n\r\n'It does,' said I.\r\n\r\n'That, then, which needs nothing outside itself, which can accomplish\r\nall things in its own strength, which enjoys fame and compels reverence,\r\nmust not this evidently be also fully crowned with joy?'\r\n\r\n'In sooth, I cannot conceive,' said I, 'how any sadness can find\r\nentrance into such a state; wherefore I must needs acknowledge it full\r\nof joy--at least, if our former conclusions are to hold.'\r\n\r\n'Then, for the same reasons, this also is necessary--that independence,\r\npower, renown, reverence, and sweetness of delight, are different only\r\nin name, but in substance differ no wise one from the other.'\r\n\r\n'It is,' said I.\r\n\r\n'This, then, which is one, and simple by nature, human perversity\r\nseparates, and, in trying to win a part of that which has no parts,\r\nfails to attain not only that portion (since there are no portions), but\r\nalso the whole, to which it does not dream of aspiring.'\r\n\r\n'How so?' said I.\r\n\r\n'He who, to escape want, seeks riches, gives himself no concern about\r\npower; he prefers a mean and low estate, and also denies himself many\r\npleasures dear to nature to avoid losing the money which he has gained.\r\nBut at this rate he does not even attain to independence--a weakling\r\nvoid of strength, vexed by distresses, mean and despised, and buried in\r\nobscurity. He, again, who thirsts alone for power squanders his wealth,\r\ndespises pleasure, and thinks fame and rank alike worthless without\r\npower. But thou seest in how many ways his state also is defective.\r\nSometimes it happens that he lacks necessaries, that he is gnawed by\r\nanxieties, and, since he cannot rid himself of these inconveniences,\r\neven ceases to have that power which was his whole end and aim. In like\r\nmanner may we cast up the reckoning in case of rank, of glory, or of\r\npleasure. For since each one of these severally is identical with the\r\nrest, whosoever seeks any one of them without the others does not even\r\nlay hold of that one which he makes his aim.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' said I, 'what then?'\r\n\r\n'Suppose anyone desire to obtain them together, he does indeed wish for\r\nhappiness as a whole; but will he find it in these things which, as we\r\nhave proved, are unable to bestow what they promise?'\r\n\r\n'Nay; by no means,' said I.\r\n\r\n'Then, happiness must certainly not be sought in these things which\r\nseverally are believed to afford some one of the blessings most to be\r\ndesired.'\r\n\r\n'They must not, I admit. No conclusion could be more true.'\r\n\r\n'So, then, the form and the causes of false happiness are set before\r\nthine eyes. Now turn thy gaze to the other side; there thou wilt\r\nstraightway see the true happiness I promised.'\r\n\r\n'Yea, indeed, 'tis plain to the blind.' said I. 'Thou didst point it out\r\neven now in seeking to unfold the causes of the false. For, unless I am\r\nmistaken, that is true and perfect happiness which crowns one with the\r\nunion of independence, power, reverence, renown, and joy. And to prove\r\nto thee with how deep an insight I have listened--since all these are\r\nthe same--that which can truly bestow one of them I know to be without\r\ndoubt full and complete happiness.'\r\n\r\n'Happy art thou, my scholar, in this thy conviction; only one thing\r\nshouldst thou add.'\r\n\r\n'What is that?' said I.\r\n\r\n'Is there aught, thinkest thou, amid these mortal and perishable things\r\nwhich can produce a state such as this?'\r\n\r\n'Nay, surely not; and this thou hast so amply demonstrated that no word\r\nmore is needed.'\r\n\r\n'Well, then, these things seem to give to mortals shadows of the true\r\ngood, or some kind of imperfect good; but the true and perfect good they\r\ncannot bestow.'\r\n\r\n'Even so,' said I.\r\n\r\n'Since, then, thou hast learnt what that true happiness is, and what men\r\nfalsely call happiness, it now remains that thou shouldst learn from\r\nwhat source to seek this.'\r\n\r\n'Yes; to this I have long been eagerly looking forward.'\r\n\r\n'Well, since, as Plato maintains in the \"Timæus,\" we ought even in the\r\nmost trivial matters to implore the Divine protection, what thinkest\r\nthou should we now do in order to deserve to find the seat of that\r\nhighest good?'\r\n\r\n'We must invoke the Father of all things,' said I; 'for without this no\r\nenterprise sets out from a right beginning.'\r\n\r\n'Thou sayest well,' said she; and forthwith lifted up her voice and\r\nsang:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG IX.[I]\r\n\r\nINVOCATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Maker of earth and sky, from age to age\r\n    Who rul'st the world by reason; at whose word\r\n    Time issues from Eternity's abyss:\r\n    To all that moves the source of movement, fixed\r\n    Thyself and moveless. Thee no cause impelled\r\n    Extrinsic this proportioned frame to shape\r\n    From shapeless matter; but, deep-set within\r\n    Thy inmost being, the form of perfect good,\r\n    From envy free; and Thou didst mould the whole\r\n    To that supernal pattern. Beauteous\r\n    The world in Thee thus imaged, being Thyself\r\n\r\n\r\n    Most beautiful. So Thou the work didst fashion\r\n    In that fair likeness, bidding it put on\r\n    Perfection through the exquisite perfectness\r\n    Of every part's contrivance. Thou dost bind\r\n    The elements in balanced harmony,\r\n    So that the hot and cold, the moist and dry,\r\n    Contend not; nor the pure fire leaping up\r\n    Escape, or weight of waters whelm the earth.\r\n\r\n    Thou joinest and diffusest through the whole,\r\n    Linking accordantly its several parts,\r\n    A soul of threefold nature, moving all.\r\n    This, cleft in twain, and in two circles gathered,\r\n    Speeds in a path that on itself returns,\r\n    Encompassing mind's limits, and conforms\r\n    The heavens to her true semblance. Lesser souls\r\n    And lesser lives by a like ordinance\r\n    Thou sendest forth, each to its starry car\r\n    Affixing, and dost strew them far and wide\r\n    O'er earth and heaven. These by a law benign\r\n    Thou biddest turn again, and render back\r\n    To thee their fires. Oh, grant, almighty Father,\r\n    Grant us on reason's wing to soar aloft\r\n    To heaven's exalted height; grant us to see\r\n    The fount of good; grant us, the true light found,\r\n    To fix our steadfast eyes in vision clear\r\n    On Thee. Disperse the heavy mists of earth,\r\n    And shine in Thine own splendour. For Thou art\r\n    The true serenity and perfect rest\r\n    Of every pious soul--to see Thy face,\r\n    The end and the beginning--One the guide,\r\n    The traveller, the pathway, and the goal.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[I] The substance of this poem is taken from Plato's 'Timæus,' 29-42.\r\nSee Jowett, vol. iii., pp. 448-462 (third edition).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Since now thou hast seen what is the form of the imperfect good, and\r\nwhat the form of the perfect also, methinks I should next show in what\r\nmanner this perfection of felicity is built up. And here I conceive it\r\nproper to inquire, first, whether any excellence, such as thou hast\r\nlately defined, can exist in the nature of things, lest we be deceived\r\nby an empty fiction of thought to which no true reality answers. But it\r\ncannot be denied that such does exist, and is, as it were, the source of\r\nall things good. For everything which is called imperfect is spoken of\r\nas imperfect by reason of the privation of some perfection; so it comes\r\nto pass that, whenever imperfection is found in any particular, there\r\nmust necessarily be a perfection in respect of that particular also. For\r\nwere there no such perfection, it is utterly inconceivable how that\r\nso-called _im_perfection should come into existence. Nature does not\r\nmake a beginning with things mutilated and imperfect; she starts with\r\nwhat is whole and perfect, and falls away later to these feeble and\r\ninferior productions. So if there is, as we showed before, a happiness\r\nof a frail and imperfect kind, it cannot be doubted but there is also a\r\nhappiness substantial and perfect.'\r\n\r\n'Most true is thy conclusion, and most sure,' said I.\r\n\r\n'Next to consider where the dwelling-place of this happiness may be. The\r\ncommon belief of all mankind agrees that God, the supreme of all things,\r\nis good. For since nothing can be imagined better than God, how can we\r\ndoubt Him to be good than whom there is nothing better? Now, reason\r\nshows God to be good in such wise as to prove that in Him is perfect\r\ngood. For were it not so, He would not be supreme of all things; for\r\nthere would be something else more excellent, possessed of perfect good,\r\nwhich would seem to have the advantage in priority and dignity, since it\r\nhas clearly appeared that all perfect things are prior to those less\r\ncomplete. Wherefore, lest we fall into an infinite regression, we must\r\nacknowledge the supreme God to be full of supreme and perfect good. But\r\nwe have determined that true happiness is the perfect good; therefore\r\ntrue happiness must dwell in the supreme Deity.'\r\n\r\n'I accept thy reasonings,' said I; 'they cannot in any wise be\r\ndisputed.'\r\n\r\n'But, come, see how strictly and incontrovertibly thou mayst prove this\r\nour assertion that the supreme Godhead hath fullest possession of the\r\nhighest good.'\r\n\r\n'In what way, pray?' said I.\r\n\r\n'Do not rashly suppose that He who is the Father of all things hath\r\nreceived that highest good of which He is said to be possessed either\r\nfrom some external source, or hath it as a natural endowment in such\r\nsort that thou mightest consider the essence of the happiness possessed,\r\nand of the God who possesses it, distinct and different. For if thou\r\ndeemest it received from without, thou mayst esteem that which gives\r\nmore excellent than that which has received. But Him we most worthily\r\nacknowledge to be the most supremely excellent of all things. If,\r\nhowever, it is in Him by nature, yet is logically distinct, the thought\r\nis inconceivable, since we are speaking of God, who is supreme of all\r\nthings. Who was there to join these distinct essences? Finally, when one\r\nthing is different from another, the things so conceived as distinct\r\ncannot be identical. Therefore that which of its own nature is distinct\r\nfrom the highest good is not itself the highest good--an impious thought\r\nof Him than whom, 'tis plain, nothing can be more excellent. For\r\nuniversally nothing can be better in nature than the source from which\r\nit has come; therefore on most true grounds of reason would I conclude\r\nthat which is the source of all things to be in its own essence the\r\nhighest good.'\r\n\r\n'And most justly,' said I.\r\n\r\n'But the highest good has been admitted to be happiness.'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Then,' said she, 'it is necessary to acknowledge that God is very\r\nhappiness.'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said I; 'I cannot gainsay my former admissions, and I see clearly\r\nthat this is a necessary inference therefrom.'\r\n\r\n'Reflect, also,' said she, 'whether the same conclusion is not further\r\nconfirmed by considering that there cannot be two supreme goods distinct\r\none from the other. For the goods which are different clearly cannot be\r\nseverally each what the other is: wherefore neither of the two can be\r\nperfect, since to either the other is wanting; but since it is not\r\nperfect, it cannot manifestly be the supreme good. By no means, then,\r\ncan goods which are supreme be different one from the other. But we have\r\nconcluded that both happiness and God are the supreme good; wherefore\r\nthat which is highest Divinity must also itself necessarily be supreme\r\nhappiness.'\r\n\r\n'No conclusion,' said I, 'could be truer to fact, nor more soundly\r\nreasoned out, nor more worthy of God.'\r\n\r\n'Then, further,' said she, 'just as geometricians are wont to draw\r\ninferences from their demonstrations to which they give the name\r\n\"deductions,\" so will I add here a sort of corollary. For since men\r\nbecome happy by the acquisition of happiness, while happiness is very\r\nGodship, it is manifest that they become happy by the acquisition of\r\nGodship. But as by the acquisition of justice men become just, and wise\r\nby the acquisition of wisdom, so by parity of reasoning by acquiring\r\nGodship they must of necessity become gods. So every man who is happy is\r\na god; and though in nature God is One only, yet there is nothing to\r\nhinder that very many should be gods by participation in that nature.'\r\n\r\n'A fair conclusion, and a precious,' said I, 'deduction or corollary, by\r\nwhichever name thou wilt call it.'\r\n\r\n'And yet,' said she, 'not one whit fairer than this which reason\r\npersuades us to add.'\r\n\r\n'Why, what?' said I.\r\n\r\n'Why, seeing happiness has many particulars included under it, should\r\nall these be regarded as forming one body of happiness, as it were, made\r\nup of various parts, or is there some one of them which forms the full\r\nessence of happiness, while all the rest are relative to this?'\r\n\r\n'I would thou wouldst unfold the whole matter to me at large.'\r\n\r\n'We judge happiness to be good, do we not?'\r\n\r\n'Yea, the supreme good.'\r\n\r\n'And this superlative applies to all; for this same happiness is\r\nadjudged to be the completest independence, the highest power,\r\nreverence, renown, and pleasure.'\r\n\r\n'What then?'\r\n\r\n'Are all these goods--independence, power, and the rest--to be deemed\r\nmembers of happiness, as it were, or are they all relative to good as to\r\ntheir summit and crown?'\r\n\r\n'I understand the problem, but I desire to hear how thou wouldst solve\r\nit.'\r\n\r\n'Well, then, listen to the determination of the matter. Were all these\r\nmembers composing happiness, they would differ severally one from the\r\nother. For this is the nature of parts--that by their difference they\r\ncompose one body. All these, however, have been proved to be the same;\r\ntherefore they cannot possibly be members, otherwise happiness will seem\r\nto be built up out of one member, which cannot be.'\r\n\r\n'There can be no doubt as to that,' said I; 'but I am impatient to hear\r\nwhat remains.'\r\n\r\n'Why, it is manifest that all the others are relative to the good. For\r\nthe very reason why independence is sought is that it is judged good,\r\nand so power also, because it is believed to be good. The same, too, may\r\nbe supposed of reverence, of renown, and of pleasant delight. Good,\r\nthen, is the sum and source of all desirable things. That which has not\r\nin itself any good, either in reality or in semblance, can in no wise be\r\ndesired. Contrariwise, even things which by nature are not good are\r\ndesired as if they were truly good, if they seem to be so. Whereby it\r\ncomes to pass that goodness is rightly believed to be the sum and hinge\r\nand cause of all things desirable. Now, that for the sake of which\r\nanything is desired itself seems to be most wished for. For instance, if\r\nanyone wishes to ride for the sake of health, he does not so much wish\r\nfor the exercise of riding as the benefit of his health. Since, then,\r\nall things are sought for the sake of the good, it is not these so much\r\nas good itself that is sought by all. But that on account of which all\r\nother things are wished for was, we agreed, happiness; wherefore thus\r\nalso it appears that it is happiness alone which is sought. From all\r\nwhich it is transparently clear that the essence of absolute good and of\r\nhappiness is one and the same.'\r\n\r\n'I cannot see how anyone can dissent from these conclusions.'\r\n\r\n'But we have also proved that God and true happiness are one and the\r\nsame.'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said I.\r\n\r\n'Then we can safely conclude, also, that God's essence is seated in\r\nabsolute good, and nowhere else.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG X.\r\n\r\nTHE TRUE LIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Hither come, all ye whose minds\r\n    Lust with rosy fetters binds--\r\n    Lust to bondage hard compelling\r\n    Th' earthy souls that are his dwelling--\r\n    Here shall be your labour's close;\r\n    Here your haven of repose.\r\n    Come, to your one refuge press;\r\n    Wide it stands to all distress!\r\n\r\n    Not the glint of yellow gold\r\n    Down bright Hermus' current rolled;\r\n    Not the Tagus' precious sands,\r\n    Nor in far-off scorching lands\r\n    All the radiant gems that hide\r\n    Under Indus' storied tide--\r\n    Emerald green and glistering white--\r\n    Can illume our feeble sight;\r\n    But they rather leave the mind\r\n    In its native darkness blind.\r\n    For the fairest beams they shed\r\n    In earth's lowest depths were fed;\r\n    But the splendour that supplies\r\n    Strength and vigour to the skies,\r\n    And the universe controls,\r\n    Shunneth dark and ruined souls.\r\n    He who once hath seen _this_ light\r\n    Will not call the sunbeam bright.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\n\r\n'I quite agree,' said I, 'truly all thy reasonings hold admirably\r\ntogether.'\r\n\r\nThen said she: 'What value wouldst thou put upon the boon shouldst thou\r\ncome to the knowledge of the absolute good?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, an infinite,' said I, 'if only I were so blest as to learn to know\r\nGod also who is the good.'\r\n\r\n'Yet this will I make clear to thee on truest grounds of reason, if only\r\nour recent conclusions stand fast.'\r\n\r\n'They will.'\r\n\r\n'Have we not shown that those things which most men desire are not true\r\nand perfect good precisely for this cause--that they differ severally\r\none from another, and, seeing that one is wanting to another, they\r\ncannot bestow full and absolute good; but that they become the true good\r\nwhen they are gathered, as it were, into one form and agency, so that\r\nthat which is independence is likewise power, reverence, renown, and\r\npleasant delight, and unless they are all one and the same, they have no\r\nclaim to be counted among things desirable?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; this was clearly proved, and cannot in any wise be doubted.'\r\n\r\n'Now, when things are far from being good while they are different, but\r\nbecome good as soon as they are one, is it not true that these become\r\ngood by acquiring unity?'\r\n\r\n'It seems so,' said I.\r\n\r\n'But dost not thou allow that all which is good is good by participation\r\nin goodness?'\r\n\r\n'It is.'\r\n\r\n'Then, thou must on similar grounds admit that unity and goodness are\r\nthe same; for when the effects of things in their natural working differ\r\nnot, their essence is one and the same.'\r\n\r\n'There is no denying it.'\r\n\r\n'Now, dost thou know,' said she, 'that all which is abides and subsists\r\nso long as it continues one, but so soon as it ceases to be one it\r\nperishes and falls to pieces?'\r\n\r\n'In what way?'\r\n\r\n'Why, take animals, for example. When soul and body come together, and\r\ncontinue in one, this is, we say, a living creature; but when this unity\r\nis broken by the separation of these two, the creature dies, and is\r\nclearly no longer living. The body also, while it remains in one form by\r\nthe joining together of its members, presents a human appearance; but if\r\nthe separation and dispersal of the parts break up the body's unity, it\r\nceases to be what it was. And if we extend our survey to all other\r\nthings, without doubt it will manifestly appear that each several thing\r\nsubsists while it is one, but when it ceases to be one perishes.'\r\n\r\n'Yes; when I consider further, I see it to be even as thou sayest.'\r\n\r\n'Well, is there aught,' said she, 'which, in so far as it acts\r\nconformably to nature, abandons the wish for life, and desires to come\r\nto death and corruption?'\r\n\r\n'Looking to living creatures, which have some faults of choice, I find\r\nnone that, without external compulsion, forego the will to live, and of\r\ntheir own accord hasten to destruction. For every creature diligently\r\npursues the end of self-preservation, and shuns death and destruction!\r\nAs to herbs and trees, and inanimate things generally, I am altogether\r\nin doubt what to think.'\r\n\r\n'And yet there is no possibility of question about this either, since\r\nthou seest how herbs and trees grow in places suitable for them, where,\r\nas far as their nature admits, they cannot quickly wither and die. Some\r\nspring up in the plains, others in the mountains; some grow in marshes,\r\nothers cling to rocks; and others, again, find a fertile soil in the\r\nbarren sands; and if you try to transplant these elsewhere, they wither\r\naway. Nature gives to each the soil that suits it, and uses her\r\ndiligence to prevent any of them dying, so long as it is possible for\r\nthem to continue alive. Why do they all draw their nourishment from\r\nroots as from a mouth dipped into the earth, and distribute the strong\r\nbark over the pith? Why are all the softer parts like the pith deeply\r\nencased within, while the external parts have the strong texture of\r\nwood, and outside of all is the bark to resist the weather's\r\ninclemency, like a champion stout in endurance? Again, how great is\r\nnature's diligence to secure universal propagation by multiplying seed!\r\nWho does not know all these to be contrivances, not only for the present\r\nmaintenance of a species, but for its lasting continuance, generation\r\nafter generation, for ever? And do not also the things believed\r\ninanimate on like grounds of reason seek each what is proper to itself?\r\nWhy do the flames shoot lightly upward, while the earth presses downward\r\nwith its weight, if it is not that these motions and situations are\r\nsuitable to their respective natures? Moreover, each several thing is\r\npreserved by that which is agreeable to its nature, even as it is\r\ndestroyed by things inimical. Things solid like stones resist\r\ndisintegration by the close adhesion of their parts. Things fluid like\r\nair and water yield easily to what divides them, but swiftly flow back\r\nand mingle with those parts from which they have been severed, while\r\nfire, again, refuses to be cut at all. And we are not now treating of\r\nthe voluntary motions of an intelligent soul, but of the drift of\r\nnature. Even so is it that we digest our food without thinking about it,\r\nand draw our breath unconsciously in sleep; nay, even in living\r\ncreatures the love of life cometh not of conscious will, but from the\r\nprinciples of nature. For oftentimes in the stress of circumstances will\r\nchooses the death which nature shrinks from; and contrarily, in spite of\r\nnatural appetite, will restrains that work of reproduction by which\r\nalone the persistence of perishable creatures is maintained. So entirely\r\ndoes this love of self come from drift of nature, not from animal\r\nimpulse. Providence has furnished things with this most cogent reason\r\nfor continuance: they must desire life, so long as it is naturally\r\npossible for them to continue living. Wherefore in no way mayst thou\r\ndoubt but that things naturally aim at continuance of existence, and\r\nshun destruction.'\r\n\r\n'I confess,' said I, 'that what I lately thought uncertain, I now\r\nperceive to be indubitably clear.'\r\n\r\n'Now, that which seeks to subsist and continue desires to be one; for if\r\nits oneness be gone, its very existence cannot continue.'\r\n\r\n'True,' said I.\r\n\r\n'All things, then, desire to be one.'\r\n\r\n'I agree.'\r\n\r\n'But we have proved that one is the very same thing as good.'\r\n\r\n'We have.'\r\n\r\n'All things, then, seek the good; indeed, you may express the fact by\r\ndefining good as that which all desire.'\r\n\r\n'Nothing could be more truly thought out. Either there is no single end\r\nto which all things are relative, or else the end to which all things\r\nuniversally hasten must be the highest good of all.'\r\n\r\nThen she: 'Exceedingly do I rejoice, dear pupil; thine eye is now fixed\r\non the very central mark of truth. Moreover, herein is revealed that of\r\nwhich thou didst erstwhile profess thyself ignorant.'\r\n\r\n'What is that?' said I.\r\n\r\n'The end and aim of the whole universe. Surely it is that which is\r\ndesired of all; and, since we have concluded the good to be such, we\r\nought to acknowledge the end and aim of the whole universe to be \"the\r\ngood.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG XI.\r\n\r\nREMINISCENCE.[J]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Who truth pursues, who from false ways\r\n      His heedful steps would keep,\r\n    By inward light must search within\r\n      In meditation deep;\r\n    All outward bent he must repress\r\n    His soul's true treasure to possess.\r\n\r\n    Then all that error's mists obscured\r\n      Shall shine more clear than light,\r\n    This fleshly frame's oblivious weight\r\n      Hath quenched not reason quite;\r\n    The germs of truth still lie within,\r\n    Whence we by learning all may win.\r\n\r\n    Else how could ye the answer due\r\n      Untaught to questions give,\r\n    Were't not that deep within the soul\r\n      Truth's secret sparks do live?\r\n    If Plato's teaching erreth not,\r\n    We learn but that we have forgot.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[J] The doctrine of Reminiscence--_i.e._, that all learning is really\r\nrecollection--is set forth at length by Plato in the 'Meno,' 81-86, and\r\nthe 'Phædo,' 72-76. See Jowett, vol. ii., pp. 40-47 and 213-218.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen said I: 'With all my heart I agree with Plato; indeed, this is now\r\nthe second time that these things have been brought back to my\r\nmind--first I lost them through the clogging contact of the body; then\r\nafter through the stress of heavy grief.'\r\n\r\nThen she continued: 'If thou wilt reflect upon thy former admissions, it\r\nwill not be long before thou dost also recollect that of which erstwhile\r\nthou didst confess thyself ignorant.'\r\n\r\n'What is that?' said I.\r\n\r\n'The principles of the world's government,' said she.\r\n\r\n'Yes; I remember my confession, and, although I now anticipate what thou\r\nintendest, I have a desire to hear the argument plainly set forth.'\r\n\r\n'Awhile ago thou deemedst it beyond all doubt that God doth govern the\r\nworld.'\r\n\r\n'I do not think it doubtful now, nor shall I ever; and by what reasons\r\nI am brought to this assurance I will briefly set forth. This world\r\ncould never have taken shape as a single system out of parts so diverse\r\nand opposite were it not that there is One who joins together these so\r\ndiverse things. And when it had once come together, the very diversity\r\nof natures would have dissevered it and torn it asunder in universal\r\ndiscord were there not One who keeps together what He has joined. Nor\r\nwould the order of nature proceed so regularly, nor could its course\r\nexhibit motions so fixed in respect of position, time, range, efficacy,\r\nand character, unless there were One who, Himself abiding, disposed\r\nthese various vicissitudes of change. This power, whatsoever it be,\r\nwhereby they remain as they were created, and are kept in motion, I call\r\nby the name which all recognise--God.'\r\n\r\nThen said she: 'Seeing that such is thy belief, it will cost me little\r\ntrouble, I think, to enable thee to win happiness, and return in safety\r\nto thy own country. But let us give our attention to the task that we\r\nhave set before ourselves. Have we not counted independence in the\r\ncategory of happiness, and agreed that God is absolute happiness?'\r\n\r\n'Truly, we have.'\r\n\r\n'Then, He will need no external assistance for the ruling of the world.\r\nOtherwise, if He stands in need of aught, He will not possess complete\r\nindependence.'\r\n\r\n'That is necessarily so,' said I.\r\n\r\n'Then, by His own power alone He disposes all things.'\r\n\r\n'It cannot be denied.'\r\n\r\n'Now, God was proved to be absolute good.'\r\n\r\n'Yes; I remember.'\r\n\r\n'Then, He disposes all things by the agency of good, if it be true that\r\n_He_ rules all things by His own power whom we have agreed to be good;\r\nand He is, as it were, the rudder and helm by which the world's\r\nmechanism is kept steady and in order.'\r\n\r\n'Heartily do I agree; and, indeed, I anticipated what thou wouldst say,\r\nthough it may be in feeble surmise only.'\r\n\r\n'I well believe it,' said she; 'for, as I think, thou now bringest to\r\nthe search eyes quicker in discerning truth; but what I shall say next\r\nis no less plain and easy to see.'\r\n\r\n'What is it?' said I.\r\n\r\n'Why,' said she, 'since God is rightly believed to govern all things\r\nwith the rudder of goodness, and since all things do likewise, as I have\r\ntaught, haste towards good by the very aim of nature, can it be doubted\r\nthat His governance is willingly accepted, and that all submit\r\nthemselves to the sway of the Disposer as conformed and attempered to\r\nHis rule?'\r\n\r\n'Necessarily so,' said I; 'no rule would seem happy if it were a yoke\r\nimposed on reluctant wills, and not the safe-keeping of obedient\r\nsubjects.'\r\n\r\n'There is nothing, then, which, while it follows nature, endeavours to\r\nresist good.'\r\n\r\n'No; nothing.'\r\n\r\n'But if anything should, will it have the least success against Him whom\r\nwe rightly agreed to be supreme Lord of happiness?'\r\n\r\n'It would be utterly impotent.'\r\n\r\n'There is nothing, then, which has either the will or the power to\r\noppose this supreme good.'\r\n\r\n'No; I think not.'\r\n\r\n'So, then,' said she, 'it is the supreme good which rules in strength,\r\nand graciously disposes all things.'\r\n\r\nThen said I: 'How delighted am I at thy reasonings, and the conclusion\r\nto which thou hast brought them, but most of all at these very words\r\nwhich thou usest! I am now at last ashamed of the folly that so sorely\r\nvexed me.'\r\n\r\n'Thou hast heard the story of the giants assailing heaven; but a\r\nbeneficent strength disposed of them also, as they deserved. But shall\r\nwe submit our arguments to the shock of mutual collision?--it may be\r\nfrom the impact some fair spark of truth may be struck out.'\r\n\r\n'If it be thy good pleasure,' said I.\r\n\r\n'No one can doubt that God is all-powerful.'\r\n\r\n'No one at all can question it who thinks consistently.'\r\n\r\n'Now, there is nothing which One who is all-powerful cannot do.'\r\n\r\n'Nothing.'\r\n\r\n'But can God do evil, then?'\r\n\r\n'Nay; by no means.'\r\n\r\n'Then, evil is nothing,' said she, 'since He to whom nothing is\r\nimpossible is unable to do evil.'\r\n\r\n'Art thou mocking me,' said I, 'weaving a labyrinth of tangled\r\narguments, now seeming to begin where thou didst end, and now to end\r\nwhere thou didst begin, or dost thou build up some wondrous circle of\r\nDivine simplicity? For, truly, a little before thou didst begin with\r\nhappiness, and say it was the supreme good, and didst declare it to be\r\nseated in the supreme Godhead. God Himself, too, thou didst affirm to be\r\nsupreme good and all-complete happiness; and from this thou didst go on\r\nto add, as by the way, the proof that no one would be happy unless he\r\nwere likewise God. Again, thou didst say that the very form of good was\r\nthe essence both of God and of happiness, and didst teach that the\r\nabsolute One was the absolute good which was sought by universal nature.\r\nThou didst maintain, also, that God rules the universe by the governance\r\nof goodness, that all things obey Him willingly, and that evil has no\r\nexistence in nature. And all this thou didst unfold without the help of\r\nassumptions from without, but by inherent and proper proofs, drawing\r\ncredence one from the other.'\r\n\r\nThen answered she: 'Far is it from me to mock thee; nay, by the blessing\r\nof God, whom we lately addressed in prayer, we have achieved the most\r\nimportant of all objects. For such is the form of the Divine essence,\r\nthat neither can it pass into things external, nor take up anything\r\nexternal into itself; but, as Parmenides says of it,\r\n\r\n    '\"In body like to a sphere on all sides perfectly rounded,\"\r\n\r\nit rolls the restless orb of the universe, keeping itself motionless the\r\nwhile. And if I have also employed reasonings not drawn from without,\r\nbut lying within the compass of our subject, there is no cause for thee\r\nto marvel, since thou hast learnt on Plato's authority that words ought\r\nto be akin to the matter of which they treat.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG XII.\r\n\r\nORPHEUS AND EURYDICE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Blest he whose feet have stood\r\n    Beside the fount of good;\r\n    Blest he whose will could break\r\n    Earth's chains for wisdom's sake!\r\n\r\n    The Thracian bard, 'tis said,\r\n    Mourned his dear consort dead;\r\n    To hear the plaintive strain\r\n    The woods moved in his train,\r\n    And the stream ceased to flow,\r\n    Held by so soft a woe;\r\n    The deer without dismay\r\n    Beside the lion lay;\r\n    The hound, by song subdued,\r\n    No more the hare pursued,\r\n    But the pang unassuaged\r\n    In his own bosom raged.\r\n    The music that could calm\r\n    All else brought him no balm.\r\n    Chiding the powers immortal,\r\n    He came unto Hell's portal;\r\n    There breathed all tender things\r\n    Upon his sounding strings,\r\n    Each rhapsody high-wrought\r\n    His goddess-mother taught--\r\n    All he from grief could borrow\r\n    And love redoubling sorrow,\r\n    Till, as the echoes waken,\r\n    All Tænarus is shaken;\r\n    Whilst he to ruth persuades\r\n    The monarch of the shades\r\n    With dulcet prayer.

(b) The righteous never lack their reward, nor the wicked\r\n     their punishment.--CH. IV. (c) The wicked are more unhappy when\r\n     they accomplish their desires than when they fail to attain them.\r\n     (d) Evil-doers are more fortunate when they expiate their crimes by\r\n     suffering punishment than when they escape unpunished. (e) The\r\n     wrong-doer is more wretched than he who suffers injury.--CH. V.\r\n     Boethius still cannot understand why the distribution of happiness\r\n     and misery to the righteous and the wicked seems the result of\r\n     chance. Philosophy replies that this only seems so because we do\r\n     not understand the principles of God's moral governance.--CH. VI.\r\n     The distinction of Fate and Providence. The apparent moral\r\n     confusion is due to our ignorance of the secret counsels of God's\r\n     providence. If we possessed the key, we should see how all things\r\n     are guided to good.--CH.

Thus all fortune is good fortune; for\r\n     it either rewards, disciplines, amends, or punishes, and so is\r\n     either useful or just.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoftly and sweetly Philosophy sang these verses to the end without\r\nlosing aught of the dignity of her expression or the seriousness of her\r\ntones; then, forasmuch as I was as yet unable to forget my deeply-seated\r\nsorrow, just as she was about to say something further, I broke in and\r\ncried: 'O thou guide into the way of true light, all that thy voice hath\r\nuttered from the beginning even unto now has manifestly seemed to me at\r\nonce divine contemplated in itself, and by the force of thy arguments\r\nplaced beyond the possibility of overthrow. Moreover, these truths have\r\nnot been altogether unfamiliar to me heretofore, though because of\r\nindignation at my wrongs they have for a time been forgotten. But, lo!\r\nherein is the very chiefest cause of my grief--that, while there exists\r\na good ruler of the universe, it is possible that evil should be at all,\r\nstill more that it should go unpunished. Surely thou must see how\r\ndeservedly this of itself provokes astonishment. But a yet greater\r\nmarvel follows: While wickedness reigns and flourishes, virtue not only\r\nlacks its reward, but is even thrust down and trampled under the feet of\r\nthe wicked, and suffers punishment in the place of crime. That this\r\nshould happen under the rule of a God who knows all things and can do\r\nall things, but wills only the good, cannot be sufficiently wondered at\r\nnor sufficiently lamented.'\r\n\r\nThen said she: 'It would indeed be infinitely astounding, and of all\r\nmonstrous things most horrible, if, as thou esteemest, in the\r\nwell-ordered home of so great a householder, the base vessels should be\r\nheld in honour, the precious left to neglect. But it is not so. For if\r\nwe hold unshaken those conclusions which we lately reached, thou shall\r\nlearn that, by the will of Him of whose realm we are speaking, the good\r\nare always strong, the bad always weak and impotent; that vices never go\r\nunpunished, nor virtues unrewarded; that good fortune ever befalls the\r\ngood, and ill fortune the bad, and much more of the sort, which shall\r\nhush thy murmurings, and stablish thee in the strong assurance of\r\nconviction. And since by my late instructions thou hast seen the form of\r\nhappiness, hast learnt, too, the seat where it is to be found, all due\r\npreliminaries being discharged, I will now show thee the road which will\r\nlead thee home. Wings, also, will I fasten to thy mind wherewith thou\r\nmayst soar aloft, that so, all disturbing doubts removed, thou mayst\r\nreturn safe to thy country, under my guidance, in the path I will show\r\nthee, and by the means which I furnish.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG I.\r\n\r\nTHE SOUL'S FLIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Wings are mine; above the pole\r\n      Far aloft I soar.\r\n    Clothed with these, my nimble soul\r\n      Scorns earth's hated shore,\r\n    Cleaves the skies upon the wind,\r\n    Sees the clouds left far behind.\r\n\r\n    Soon the glowing point she nears,\r\n      Where the heavens rotate,\r\n    Follows through the starry spheres\r\n      Phoebus' course, or straight\r\n    Takes for comrade 'mid the stars\r\n    Saturn cold or glittering Mars;\r\n\r\n    Thus each circling orb explores\r\n      Through Night's stole that peers;\r\n    Then, when all are numbered, soars\r\n      Far beyond the spheres,\r\n    Mounting heaven's supremest height\r\n    To the very Fount of light.\r\n\r\n    There the Sovereign of the world\r\n      His calm sway maintains;\r\n    As the globe is onward whirled\r\n      Guides the chariot reins,\r\n    And in splendour glittering\r\n    Reigns the universal King.\r\n\r\n    Hither if thy wandering feet\r\n      Find at last a way,\r\n    Here thy long-lost home thou'lt greet:\r\n      'Dear lost land,' thou'lt say,\r\n    'Though from thee I've wandered wide,\r\n    Hence I came, here will abide.'\r\n\r\n    Yet if ever thou art fain\r\n      Visitant to be\r\n    Of earth's gloomy night again,\r\n      Surely thou wilt see\r\n    Tyrants whom the nations fear\r\n    Dwell in hapless exile here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen said I: 'Verily, wondrous great are thy promises; yet I do not\r\ndoubt but thou canst make them good: only keep me not in suspense after\r\nraising such hopes.'\r\n\r\n'Learn, then, first,' said she, 'how that power ever waits upon the\r\ngood, while the bad are left wholly destitute of strength.[K] Of these\r\ntruths the one proves the other; for since good and evil are contraries,\r\nif it is made plain that good is power, the feebleness of evil is\r\nclearly seen, and, conversely, if the frail nature of evil is made\r\nmanifest, the strength of good is thereby known. However, to win ampler\r\ncredence for my conclusion, I will pursue both paths, and draw\r\nconfirmation for my statements first in one way and then in the other.\r\n\r\n'The carrying out of any human action depends upon two things--to wit,\r\nwill and power; if either be wanting, nothing can be accomplished. For\r\nif the will be lacking, no attempt at all is made to do what is not\r\nwilled; whereas if there be no power, the will is all in vain. And so,\r\nif thou seest any man wishing to attain some end, yet utterly failing to\r\nattain it, thou canst not doubt that he lacked the power of getting what\r\nhe wished for.'\r\n\r\n'Why, certainly not; there is no denying it.'\r\n\r\n'Canst thou, then, doubt that he whom thou seest to have accomplished\r\nwhat he willed had also the power to accomplish it?'\r\n\r\n'Of course not.'\r\n\r\n'Then, in respect of what he can accomplish a man is to be reckoned\r\nstrong, in respect of what he cannot accomplish weak?'\r\n\r\n'Granted,' said I.\r\n\r\n'Then, dost thou remember that, by our former reasonings, it was\r\nconcluded that the whole aim of man's will, though the means of pursuit\r\nvary, is set intently upon happiness?'\r\n\r\n'I do remember that this, too, was proved.'\r\n\r\n'Dost thou also call to mind how happiness is absolute good, and\r\ntherefore that, when happiness is sought, it is good which is in all\r\ncases the object of desire?'\r\n\r\n'Nay, I do not so much call to mind as keep it fixed in my memory.'\r\n\r\n'Then, all men, good and bad alike, with one indistinguishable purpose\r\nstrive to reach good?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, that follows.'\r\n\r\n'But it is certain that by the attainment of good men become good?'\r\n\r\n'It is.'\r\n\r\n'Then, do the good attain their object?'\r\n\r\n'It seems so.'\r\n\r\n'But if the bad were to attain the good which is _their_ object, they\r\ncould not be bad?'\r\n\r\n'No.'\r\n\r\n'Then, since both seek good, but while the one sort attain it, the other\r\nattain it not, is there any doubt that the good are endued with power,\r\nwhile they who are bad are weak?'\r\n\r\n'If any doubt it, he is incapable of reflecting on the nature of things,\r\nor the consequences involved in reasoning.'\r\n\r\n'Again, supposing there are two things to which the same function is\r\nprescribed in the course of nature, and one of these successfully\r\naccomplishes the function by natural action, the other is altogether\r\nincapable of that natural action, instead of which, in a way other than\r\nis agreeable to its nature, it--I will not say fulfils its function, but\r\nfeigns to fulfil it: which of these two would in thy view be the\r\nstronger?'\r\n\r\n'I guess thy meaning, but I pray thee let me hear thee more at large.'\r\n\r\n'Walking is man's natural motion, is it not?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly.'\r\n\r\n'Thou dost not doubt, I suppose, that it is natural for the feet to\r\ndischarge this function?'\r\n\r\n'No; surely I do not.'\r\n\r\n'Now, if one man who is able to use his feet walks, and another to whom\r\nthe natural use of his feet is wanting tries to walk on his hands,\r\nwhich of the two wouldst thou rightly esteem the stronger?'\r\n\r\n'Go on,' said I; 'no one can question but that he who has the natural\r\ncapacity has more strength than he who has it not.'\r\n\r\n'Now, the supreme good is set up as the end alike for the bad and for\r\nthe good; but the good seek it through the natural action of the\r\nvirtues, whereas the bad try to attain this same good through all manner\r\nof concupiscence, which is not the natural way of attaining good. Or\r\ndost thou think otherwise?'\r\n\r\n'Nay; rather, one further consequence is clear to me: for from my\r\nadmissions it must needs follow that the good have power, and the bad\r\nare impotent.'\r\n\r\n'Thou anticipatest rightly, and that as physicians reckon is a sign that\r\nnature is set working, and is throwing off the disease. But, since I see\r\nthee so ready at understanding, I will heap proof on proof. Look how\r\nmanifest is the extremity of vicious men's weakness; they cannot even\r\nreach that goal to which the aim of nature leads and almost constrains\r\nthem. What if they were left without this mighty, this well-nigh\r\nirresistible help of nature's guidance! Consider also how momentous is\r\nthe powerlessness which incapacitates the wicked. Not light or\r\ntrivial[L] are the prizes which they contend for, but which they cannot\r\nwin or hold; nay, their failure concerns the very sum and crown of\r\nthings. Poor wretches! they fail to compass even that for which they\r\ntoil day and night. Herein also the strength of the good conspicuously\r\nappears. For just as thou wouldst judge him to be the strongest walker\r\nwhose legs could carry him to a point beyond which no further advance\r\nwas possible, so must thou needs account him strong in power who so\r\nattains the end of his desires that nothing further to be desired lies\r\nbeyond. Whence follows the obvious conclusion that they who are wicked\r\nare seen likewise to be wholly destitute of strength. For why do they\r\nforsake virtue and follow vice? Is it from ignorance of what is good?\r\nWell, what is more weak and feeble than the blindness of ignorance? Do\r\nthey know what they ought to follow, but lust drives them aside out of\r\nthe way? If it be so, they are still frail by reason of their\r\nincontinence, for they cannot fight against vice. Or do they knowingly\r\nand wilfully forsake the good and turn aside to vice? Why, at this rate,\r\nthey not only cease to have power, but cease to be at all. For they who\r\nforsake the common end of all things that are, they likewise also cease\r\nto be at all. Now, to some it may seem strange that we should assert\r\nthat the bad, who form the greater part of mankind, do not exist. But\r\nthe fact is so. I do not, indeed, deny that they who are bad are bad,\r\nbut that they _are_ in an unqualified and absolute sense I deny. Just as\r\nwe call a corpse a dead man, but cannot call it simply \"man,\" so I would\r\nallow the vicious to be bad, but that they _are_ in an absolute sense I\r\ncannot allow. That only _is_ which maintains its place and keeps its\r\nnature; whatever falls away from this forsakes the existence which is\r\nessential to its nature. \"But,\" thou wilt say, \"the bad have an\r\nability.\" Nor do I wish to deny it; only this ability of theirs comes\r\nnot from strength, but from impotence. For their ability is to do evil,\r\nwhich would have had no efficacy at all if they could have continued in\r\nthe performance of good. So this ability of theirs proves them still\r\nmore plainly to have no power. For if, as we concluded just now, evil is\r\nnothing, 'tis clear that the wicked can effect nothing, since they are\r\nonly able to do evil.'\r\n\r\n''Tis evident.'\r\n\r\n'And that thou mayst understand what is the precise force of this power,\r\nwe determined, did we not, awhile back, that nothing has more power than\r\nsupreme good?'\r\n\r\n'We did,' said I.\r\n\r\n'But that same highest good cannot do evil?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly not.'\r\n\r\n'Is there anyone, then, who thinks that men are able to do all things?'\r\n\r\n'None but a madman.'\r\n\r\n'Yet they are able to do evil?'\r\n\r\n'Ay; would they could not!'\r\n\r\n'Since, then, he who can do only good is omnipotent, while they who can\r\ndo evil also are not omnipotent, it is manifest that they who can do\r\nevil have less power. There is this also: we have shown that all power\r\nis to be reckoned among things desirable, and that all desirable things\r\nare referred to good as to a kind of consummation of their nature. But\r\nthe ability to commit crime cannot be referred to the good; therefore it\r\nis not a thing to be desired. And yet all power is desirable; it is\r\nclear, then, that ability to do evil is not power. From all which\r\nconsiderations appeareth the power of the good, and the indubitable\r\nweakness of the bad, and it is clear that Plato's judgment was true; the\r\nwise alone are able to do what they would, while the wicked follow their\r\nown hearts' lust, but can _not_ accomplish what they would. For they go\r\non in their wilfulness fancying they will attain what they wish for in\r\nthe paths of delight; but they are very far from its attainment, since\r\nshameful deeds lead not to happiness.'\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[K] The paradoxes in this chapter and chapter iv. are taken from Plato's\r\n'Gorgias.'

Whereby it is manifest that\r\ngoodness never lacks its reward, nor crime its punishment. For, verily,\r\nin all manner of transactions that for the sake of which the particular\r\naction is done may justly be accounted the reward of that action, even\r\nas the wreath for the sake of which the race is run is the reward\r\noffered for running. Now, we have shown happiness to be that very good\r\nfor the sake of which all things are done. Absolute good, then, is\r\noffered as the common prize, as it were, of all human actions. But,\r\ntruly, this is a reward from which it is impossible to separate the good\r\nman, for one who is without good cannot properly be called good at all;\r\nwherefore righteous dealing never misses its reward. Rage the wicked,\r\nthen, never so violently, the crown shall not fall from the head of the\r\nwise, nor wither. Verily, other men's unrighteousness cannot pluck from\r\nrighteous souls their proper glory. Were the reward in which the soul of\r\nthe righteous delighteth received from without, then might it be taken\r\naway by him who gave it, or some other; but since it is conferred by his\r\nown righteousness, then only will he lose his prize when he has ceased\r\nto be righteous. Lastly, since every prize is desired because it is\r\nbelieved to be good, who can account him who possesses good to be\r\nwithout reward? And what a prize, the fairest and grandest of all! For\r\nremember the corollary which I chiefly insisted on a little while back,\r\nand reason thus: Since absolute good is happiness, 'tis clear that all\r\nthe good must be happy for the very reason that they are good. But it\r\nwas agreed that those who are happy are gods. So, then, the prize of the\r\ngood is one which no time may impair, no man's power lessen, no man's\r\nunrighteousness tarnish; 'tis very Godship. And this being so, the wise\r\nman cannot doubt that punishment is inseparable from the bad. For since\r\ngood and bad, and likewise reward and punishment, are contraries, it\r\nnecessarily follows that, corresponding to all that we see accrue as\r\nreward of the good, there is some penalty attached as punishment of\r\nevil. As, then, righteousness itself is the reward of the righteous, so\r\nwickedness itself is the punishment of the unrighteous. Now, no one who\r\nis visited with punishment doubts that he is visited with evil.\r\nAccordingly, if they were but willing to weigh their own case, could\r\n_they_ think themselves free from punishment whom wickedness, worst of\r\nall evils, has not only touched, but deeply tainted?\r\n\r\n'See, also, from the opposite standpoint--the standpoint of the\r\ngood--what a penalty attends upon the wicked. Thou didst learn a little\r\nsince that whatever is is one, and that unity itself is good.\r\nAccordingly, by this way of reckoning, whatever falls away from goodness\r\nceases to be; whence it comes to pass that the bad cease to be what they\r\nwere, while only the outward aspect is still left to show they have been\r\nmen. Wherefore, by their perversion to badness, they have lost their\r\ntrue human nature. Further, since righteousness alone can raise men\r\nabove the level of humanity, it must needs be that unrighteousness\r\ndegrades below man's level those whom it has cast out of man's estate.\r\nIt results, then, that thou canst not consider him human whom thou seest\r\ntransformed by vice. The violent despoiler of other men's goods,\r\nenflamed with covetousness, surely resembles a wolf. A bold and restless\r\nspirit, ever wrangling in law-courts, is like some yelping cur. The\r\nsecret schemer, taking pleasure in fraud and stealth, is own brother to\r\nthe fox. The passionate man, phrenzied with rage, we might believe to be\r\nanimated with the soul of a lion. The coward and runaway, afraid where\r\nno fear is, may be likened to the timid deer. He who is sunk in\r\nignorance and stupidity lives like a dull ass. He who is light and\r\ninconstant, never holding long to one thing, is for all the world like a\r\nbird. He who wallows in foul and unclean lusts is sunk in the pleasures\r\nof a filthy hog. So it comes to pass that he who by forsaking\r\nrighteousness ceases to be a man cannot pass into a Godlike condition,\r\nbut actually turns into a brute beast.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG III.\r\n\r\nCIRCE'S CUP.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Th' Ithacan discreet,\r\n    And all his storm-tossed fleet,\r\n    Far o'er the ocean wave\r\n    The winds of heaven drave--\r\n    Drave to the mystic isle,\r\n    Where dwelleth in her guile\r\n    That fair and faithless one,\r\n    The daughter of the Sun.\r\n    There for the stranger crew\r\n    With cunning spells she knew\r\n    To mix th' enchanted cup.\r\n    For whoso drinks it up,\r\n    Must suffer hideous change\r\n    To monstrous shapes and strange.\r\n    One like a boar appears;\r\n    This his huge form uprears,\r\n    Mighty in bulk and limb--\r\n    An Afric lion--grim\r\n    With claw and fang. Confessed\r\n    A wolf, this, sore distressed\r\n    When he would weep, doth howl;\r\n    And, strangely tame, these prowl\r\n    The Indian tiger's mates.\r\n\r\n    And though in such sore straits,\r\n    The pity of the god\r\n    Who bears the mystic rod\r\n    Had power the chieftain brave\r\n    From her fell arts to save;\r\n    His comrades, unrestrained,\r\n    The fatal goblet drained.\r\n    All now with low-bent head,\r\n    Like swine, on acorns fed;\r\n    Man's speech and form were reft,\r\n    No human feature left;\r\n    But steadfast still, the mind,\r\n    Unaltered, unresigned,\r\n    The monstrous change bewailed.\r\n\r\n    How little, then, availed\r\n    The potencies of ill!\r\n    These herbs, this baneful skill,\r\n    May change each outward part,\r\n    But cannot touch the heart.\r\n    In its true home, deep-set,\r\n    Man's spirit liveth yet.\r\n    _Those_ poisons are more fell,\r\n    More potent to expel\r\n    Man from his high estate,\r\n    Which subtly penetrate,\r\n    And leave the body whole,\r\n    But deep infect the soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen said I: 'This is very true. I see that the vicious, though they\r\nkeep the outward form of man, are rightly said to be changed into beasts\r\nin respect of their spiritual nature; but, inasmuch as their cruel and\r\npolluted minds vent their rage in the destruction of the good, I would\r\nthis license were not permitted to them.'\r\n\r\n'Nor is it,' said she, 'as shall be shown in the fitting place. Yet if\r\nthat license which thou believest to be permitted to them were taken\r\naway, the punishment of the wicked would be in great part remitted. For\r\nverily, incredible as it may seem to some, it needs must be that the bad\r\nare more unfortunate when they have accomplished their desires than if\r\nthey are unable to get them fulfilled. If it is wretched to will evil,\r\nto have been able to accomplish evil is more wretched; for without the\r\npower the wretched will would fail of effect. Accordingly, those whom\r\nthou seest to will, to be able to accomplish, and to accomplish crime,\r\nmust needs be the victims of a threefold wretchedness, since each one of\r\nthese states has its own measure of wretchedness.'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said I; 'yet I earnestly wish they might speedily be quit of this\r\nmisfortune by losing the ability to accomplish crime.'\r\n\r\n'They will lose it,' said she, 'sooner than perchance thou wishest, or\r\nthey themselves think likely; since, verily, within the narrow bounds of\r\nour brief life there is nothing so late in coming that anyone, least of\r\nall an immortal spirit, should deem it long to wait for. Their great\r\nexpectations, the lofty fabric of their crimes, is oft overthrown by a\r\nsudden and unlooked-for ending, and this but sets a limit to their\r\nmisery. For if wickedness makes men wretched, he is necessarily more\r\nwretched who is wicked for a longer time; and were it not that death, at\r\nall events, puts an end to the evil doings of the wicked, I should\r\naccount them wretched to the last degree. Indeed, if we have formed true\r\nconclusions about the ill fortune of wickedness, that wretchedness is\r\nplainly infinite which is doomed to be eternal.'\r\n\r\nThen said I: 'A wonderful inference, and difficult to grant; but I see\r\nthat it agrees entirely with our previous conclusions.'\r\n\r\n'Thou art right,' said she; 'but if anyone finds it hard to admit the\r\nconclusion, he ought in fairness either to prove some falsity in the\r\npremises, or to show that the combination of propositions does not\r\nadequately enforce the necessity of the conclusion; otherwise, if the\r\npremises be granted, nothing whatever can be said against the inference\r\nof the conclusion. And here is another statement which seems not less\r\nwonderful, but on the premises assumed is equally necessary.'\r\n\r\n'What is that?'\r\n\r\n'The wicked are happier in undergoing punishment than if no penalty of\r\njustice chasten them. And I am not now meaning what might occur to\r\nanyone--that bad character is amended by retribution, and is brought\r\ninto the right path by the terror of punishment, or that it serves as an\r\nexample to warn others to avoid transgression; but I believe that in\r\nanother way the wicked are more unfortunate when they go unpunished,\r\neven though no account be taken of amendment, and no regard be paid to\r\nexample.'\r\n\r\n'Why, what other way is there beside these?' said I.\r\n\r\nThen said she: 'Have we not agreed that the good are happy, and the evil\r\nwretched?'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said I.\r\n\r\n'Now, if,' said she, 'to one in affliction there be given along with his\r\nmisery some good thing, is he not happier than one whose misery is\r\nmisery pure and simple without admixture of any good?'\r\n\r\n'It would seem so.'\r\n\r\n'But if to one thus wretched, one destitute of all good, some further\r\nevil be added besides those which make him wretched, is he not to be\r\njudged far more unhappy than he whose ill fortune is alleviated by some\r\nshare of good?'\r\n\r\n'It could scarcely be otherwise.'\r\n\r\n'Surely, then, the wicked, when they are punished, have a good thing\r\nadded to them--to wit, the punishment which by the law of justice is\r\ngood; and likewise, when they escape punishment, a new evil attaches to\r\nthem in that very freedom from punishment which thou hast rightly\r\nacknowledged to be an evil in the case of the unrighteous.'\r\n\r\n'I cannot deny it.'\r\n\r\n'Then, the wicked are far more unhappy when indulged with an unjust\r\nfreedom from punishment than when punished by a just retribution. Now,\r\nit is manifest that it is just for the wicked to be punished, and for\r\nthem to escape unpunished is unjust.'\r\n\r\n'Why, who would venture to deny it?'\r\n\r\n'This, too, no one can possibly deny--that all which is just is good,\r\nand, conversely, all which is unjust is bad.'\r\n\r\nThen I answered: 'These inferences do indeed follow from what we lately\r\nconcluded; but tell me,' said I, 'dost thou take no account of the\r\npunishment of the soul after the death of the body?'\r\n\r\n'Nay, truly,' said she, 'great are these penalties, some of them\r\ninflicted, I imagine, in the severity of retribution, others in the\r\nmercy of purification. But it is not my present purpose to speak of\r\nthese. So far, my aim hath been to make thee recognise that the power of\r\nthe bad which shocked thee so exceedingly is no power; to make thee see\r\nthat those of whose freedom from punishment thou didst complain are\r\nnever without the proper penalties of their unrighteousness; to teach\r\nthee that the license which thou prayedst might soon come to an end is\r\nnot long-enduring; that it would be more unhappy if it lasted longer,\r\nmost unhappy of all if it lasted for ever; thereafter that the\r\nunrighteous are more wretched if unjustly let go without punishment than\r\nif punished by a just retribution--from which point of view it follows\r\nthat the wicked are afflicted with more severe penalties just when they\r\nare supposed to escape punishment.'\r\n\r\nThen said I: 'While I follow thy reasonings, I am deeply impressed with\r\ntheir truth; but if I turn to the common convictions of men, I find few\r\nwho will even listen to such arguments, let alone admit them to be\r\ncredible.'\r\n\r\n'True,' said she; 'they cannot lift eyes accustomed to darkness to the\r\nlight of clear truth, and are like those birds whose vision night\r\nillumines and day blinds; for while they regard, not the order of the\r\nuniverse, but their own dispositions of mind, they think the license to\r\ncommit crime, and the escape from punishment, to be fortunate. But mark\r\nthe ordinance of eternal law. Hast thou fashioned thy soul to the\r\nlikeness of the better, thou hast no need of a judge to award the\r\nprize--by thine own act hast thou raised thyself in the scale of\r\nexcellence; hast thou perverted thy affections to baser things, look not\r\nfor punishment from one without thee--thine own act hath degraded thee,\r\nand thrust thee down. Even so, if alternately thou turn thy gaze upon\r\nthe vile earth and upon the heavens, though all without thee stand\r\nstill, by the mere laws of sight thou seemest now sunk in the mire, now\r\nsoaring among the stars. But the common herd regards not these things.\r\nWhat, then? Shall we go over to those whom we have shown to be like\r\nbrute beasts? Why, suppose, now, one who had quite lost his sight\r\nshould likewise forget that he had ever possessed the faculty of vision,\r\nand should imagine that nothing was wanting in him to human perfection,\r\nshould we deem those who saw as well as ever blind? Why, they will not\r\neven assent to this, either--that they who do wrong are more wretched\r\nthan those who suffer wrong, though the proof of this rests on grounds\r\nof reason no less strong.'\r\n\r\n'Let me hear these same reasons,' said I.\r\n\r\n'Wouldst thou deny that every wicked man deserves punishment?'\r\n\r\n'I would not, certainly.'\r\n\r\n'And that those who are wicked are unhappy is clear in manifold ways?'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' I replied.\r\n\r\n'Thou dost not doubt, then, that those who deserve punishment are\r\nwretched?'\r\n\r\n'Agreed,' said I.\r\n\r\n'So, then, if thou wert sitting in judgment, on whom wouldst thou decree\r\nthe infliction of punishment--on him who had done the wrong, or on him\r\nwho had suffered it?'\r\n\r\n'Without doubt, I would compensate the sufferer at the cost of the doer\r\nof the wrong.'\r\n\r\n'Then, the injurer would seem more wretched than the injured?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; it follows. And so for this and other reasons resting on the same\r\nground, inasmuch as baseness of its own nature makes men wretched, it is\r\nplain that a wrong involves the misery of the doer, not of the\r\nsufferer.'\r\n\r\n'And yet,' says she, 'the practice of the law-courts is just the\r\nopposite: advocates try to arouse the commiseration of the judges for\r\nthose who have endured some grievous and cruel wrong; whereas pity is\r\nrather due to the criminal, who ought to be brought to the judgment-seat\r\nby his accusers in a spirit not of anger, but of compassion and\r\nkindness, as a sick man to the physician, to have the ulcer of his fault\r\ncut away by punishment. Whereby the business of the advocate would\r\neither wholly come to a standstill, or, did men prefer to make it\r\nserviceable to mankind, would be restricted to the practice of\r\naccusation. The wicked themselves also, if through some chink or cranny\r\nthey were permitted to behold the virtue they have forsaken, and were to\r\nsee that by the pains of punishment they would rid themselves of the\r\nuncleanness of their vices, and win in exchange the recompense of\r\nrighteousness, they would no longer think these sufferings pains; they\r\nwould refuse the help of advocates, and would commit themselves wholly\r\ninto the hands of their accusers and judges. Whence it comes to pass\r\nthat for the wise no place is left for hatred; only the most foolish\r\nwould hate the good, and to hate the bad is unreasonable. For if vicious\r\npropensity is, as it were, a disease of the soul like bodily sickness,\r\neven as we account the sick in body by no means deserving of hate, but\r\nrather of pity, so, and much more, should they be pitied whose minds are\r\nassailed by wickedness, which is more frightful than any sickness.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG IV.\r\n\r\nTHE UNREASONABLENESS OF HATRED.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Why all this furious strife? Oh, why\r\n    With rash and wilful hand provoke death's destined day?\r\n      If death ye seek--lo! Death is nigh,\r\n    Not of their master's will those coursers swift delay!\r\n\r\n      The wild beasts vent on man their rage,\r\n    Yet 'gainst their brothers' lives men point the murderous steel;\r\n      Unjust and cruel wars they wage,\r\n    And haste with flying darts the death to meet or deal.\r\n\r\n      No right nor reason can they show;\r\n    'Tis but because their lands and laws are not the same.\r\n      Wouldst _thou_ give each his due; then know\r\n    Thy love the good must have, the bad thy pity claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn this I said: 'I see how there is a happiness and misery founded on\r\nthe actual deserts of the righteous and the wicked. Nevertheless, I\r\nwonder in myself whether there is not some good and evil in fortune as\r\nthe vulgar understand it. Surely, no sensible man would rather be\r\nexiled, poor and disgraced, than dwell prosperously in his own country,\r\npowerful, wealthy, and high in honour. Indeed, the work of wisdom is\r\nmore clear and manifest in its operation when the happiness of rulers is\r\nsomehow passed on to the people around them, especially considering that\r\nthe prison, the law, and the other pains of legal punishment are\r\nproperly due only to mischievous citizens on whose account they were\r\noriginally instituted. Accordingly, I do exceedingly marvel why all this\r\nis completely reversed--why the good are harassed with the penalties due\r\nto crime, and the bad carry off the rewards of virtue; and I long to\r\nhear from thee what reason may be found for so unjust a state of\r\ndisorder. For assuredly I should wonder less if I could believe that all\r\nthings are the confused result of chance. But now my belief in God's\r\ngovernance doth add amazement to amazement. For, seeing that He\r\nsometimes assigns fair fortune to the good and harsh fortune to the bad,\r\nand then again deals harshly with the good, and grants to the bad their\r\nhearts' desire, how does this differ from chance, unless some reason is\r\ndiscovered for it all?'\r\n\r\n'Nay; it is not wonderful,' said she, 'if all should be thought random\r\nand confused when the principle of order is not known. And though thou\r\nknowest not the causes on which this great system depends, yet forasmuch\r\nas a good ruler governs the world, doubt not for thy part that all is\r\nrightly done.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG V.\r\n\r\nWONDER AND IGNORANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Who knoweth not how near the pole\r\n      Bootes' course doth go,\r\n    Must marvel by what heavenly law\r\n      He moves his Wain so slow;\r\n    Why late he plunges 'neath the main,\r\n    And swiftly lights his beams again.\r\n\r\n    When the full-orbèd moon grows pale\r\n      In the mid course of night,\r\n    And suddenly the stars shine forth\r\n      That languished in her light,\r\n    Th' astonied nations stand at gaze,\r\n    And beat the air in wild amaze.[M]\r\n\r\n    None marvels why upon the shore\r\n      The storm-lashed breakers beat,\r\n    Nor why the frost-bound glaciers melt\r\n      At summer's fervent heat;\r\n    For here the cause seems plain and clear,\r\n    Only what's dark and hid we fear.\r\n\r\n    Weak-minded folly magnifies\r\n      All that is rare and strange,\r\n    And the dull herd's o'erwhelmed with awe\r\n      At unexpected change.\r\n    But wonder leaves enlightened minds,\r\n    When ignorance no longer blinds.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[M] To frighten away the monster swallowing the moon. The superstition\r\nwas once common. See Tylor's 'Primitive Culture,' pp. 296-302.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n'True,' said I; 'but, since it is thy office to unfold the hidden cause\r\nof things, and explain principles veiled in darkness, inform me, I pray\r\nthee, of thine own conclusions in this matter, since the marvel of it is\r\nwhat more than aught else disturbs my mind.'\r\n\r\nA smile played one moment upon her lips as she replied: 'Thou callest me\r\nto the greatest of all subjects of inquiry, a task for which the most\r\nexhaustive treatment barely suffices. Such is its nature that, as fast\r\nas one doubt is cut away, innumerable others spring up like Hydra's\r\nheads, nor could we set any limit to their renewal did we not apply the\r\nmind's living fire to suppress them. For there come within its scope the\r\nquestions of the essential simplicity of providence, of the order of\r\nfate, of unforeseen chance, of the Divine knowledge and predestination,\r\nand of the freedom of the will. How heavy is the weight of all this\r\nthou canst judge for thyself. But, inasmuch as to know these things also\r\nis part of the treatment of thy malady, we will try to give them some\r\nconsideration, despite the restrictions of the narrow limits of our\r\ntime. Moreover, thou must for a time dispense with the pleasures of\r\nmusic and song, if so be that thou findest any delight therein, whilst I\r\nweave together the connected train of reasons in proper order.'\r\n\r\n'As thou wilt,' said I.\r\n\r\nThen, as if making a new beginning, she thus discoursed: 'The coming\r\ninto being of all things, the whole course of development in things that\r\nchange, every sort of thing that moves in any wise, receives its due\r\ncause, order, and form from the steadfastness of the Divine mind. This\r\nmind, calm in the citadel of its own essential simplicity, has decreed\r\nthat the method of its rule shall be manifold. Viewed in the very purity\r\nof the Divine intelligence, this method is called _providence_; but\r\nviewed in regard to those things which it moves and disposes, it is\r\nwhat the ancients called _fate_. That these two are different will\r\neasily be clear to anyone who passes in review their respective\r\nefficacies. Providence is the Divine reason itself, seated in the\r\nSupreme Being, which disposes all things; fate is the disposition\r\ninherent in all things which move, through which providence joins all\r\nthings in their proper order. Providence embraces all things, however\r\ndifferent, however infinite; fate sets in motion separately individual\r\nthings, and assigns to them severally their position, form, and time.\r\n\r\n'So the unfolding of this temporal order unified into the foreview of\r\nthe Divine mind is providence, while the same unity broken up and\r\nunfolded in time is fate. And although these are different, yet is there\r\na dependence between them; for the order of destiny issues from the\r\nessential simplicity of providence. For as the artificer, forming in his\r\nmind beforehand the idea of the thing to be made, carries out his\r\ndesign, and develops from moment to moment what he had before seen in a\r\nsingle instant as a whole, so God in His providence ordains all things\r\nas parts of a single unchanging whole, but carries out these very\r\nordinances by fate in a time of manifold unity. So whether fate is\r\naccomplished by Divine spirits as the ministers of providence, or by a\r\nsoul, or by the service of all nature--whether by the celestial motion\r\nof the stars, by the efficacy of angels, or by the many-sided cunning of\r\ndemons--whether by all or by some of these the destined series is woven,\r\nthis, at least, is manifest: that providence is the fixed and simple\r\nform of destined events, fate their shifting series in order of time, as\r\nby the disposal of the Divine simplicity they are to take place. Whereby\r\nit is that all things which are under fate are subjected also to\r\nprovidence, on which fate itself is dependent; whereas certain things\r\nwhich are set under providence are above the chain of fate--viz., those\r\nthings which by their nearness to the primal Divinity are steadfastly\r\nfixed, and lie outside the order of fate's movements. For as the\r\ninnermost of several circles revolving round the same centre approaches\r\nthe simplicity of the midmost point, and is, as it were, a pivot round\r\nwhich the exterior circles turn, while the outermost, whirled in ampler\r\norbit, takes in a wider and wider sweep of space in proportion to its\r\ndeparture from the indivisible unity of the centre--while, further,\r\nwhatever joins and allies itself to the centre is narrowed to a like\r\nsimplicity, and no longer expands vaguely into space--even so whatsoever\r\ndeparts widely from primal mind is involved more deeply in the meshes of\r\nfate, and things are free from fate in proportion as they seek to come\r\nnearer to that central pivot; while if aught cleaves close to supreme\r\nmind in its absolute fixity, this, too, being free from movement, rises\r\nabove fate's necessity. Therefore, as is reasoning to pure intelligence,\r\nas that which is generated to that which is, time to eternity, a circle\r\nto its centre, so is the shifting series of fate to the steadfastness\r\nand simplicity of providence.\r\n\r\n'It is this causal series which moves heaven and the stars, attempers\r\nthe elements to mutual accord, and again in turn transforms them into\r\nnew combinations; _this_ which renews the series of all things that are\r\nborn and die through like successions of germ and birth; it is _its_\r\noperation which binds the destinies of men by an indissoluble nexus of\r\ncausality, and, since it issues in the beginning from unalterable\r\nprovidence, these destinies also must of necessity be immutable.\r\nAccordingly, the world is ruled for the best if this unity abiding in\r\nthe Divine mind puts forth an inflexible order of causes. And this\r\norder, by its intrinsic immutability, restricts things mutable which\r\notherwise would ebb and flow at random. And so it happens that, although\r\nto you, who are not altogether capable of understanding this order, all\r\nthings seem confused and disordered, nevertheless there is everywhere an\r\nappointed limit which guides all things to good. Verily, nothing can be\r\ndone for the sake of evil even by the wicked themselves; for, as we\r\nabundantly proved, they seek good, but are drawn out of the way by\r\nperverse error; far less can this order which sets out from the supreme\r\ncentre of good turn aside anywhither from the way in which it began.\r\n\r\n'\"Yet what confusion,\" thou wilt say, \"can be more unrighteous than that\r\nprosperity and adversity should indifferently befall the good, what\r\nthey like and what they loathe come alternately to the bad!\" Yes; but\r\nhave men in real life such soundness of mind that their judgments of\r\nrighteousness and wickedness must necessarily correspond with facts?\r\nWhy, on this very point their verdicts conflict, and those whom some\r\ndeem worthy of reward, others deem worthy of punishment. Yet granted\r\nthere were one who could rightly distinguish the good and bad, yet would\r\nhe be able to look into the soul's inmost constitution, as it were, if\r\nwe may borrow an expression used of the body? The marvel here is not\r\nunlike that which astonishes one who does not know why in health sweet\r\nthings suit some constitutions, and bitter others, or why some sick men\r\nare best alleviated by mild remedies, others by severe. But the\r\nphysician who distinguishes the precise conditions and characteristics\r\nof health and sickness does not marvel. Now, the health of the soul is\r\nnothing but righteousness, and vice is its sickness. God, the guide and\r\nphysician of the mind, it is who preserves the good and banishes the\r\nbad. And He looks forth from the lofty watch-tower of His providence,\r\nperceives what is suited to each, and assigns what He knows to be\r\nsuitable.\r\n\r\n'This, then, is what that extraordinary mystery of the order of destiny\r\ncomes to--that something is done by one who knows, whereat the ignorant\r\nare astonished. But let us consider a few instances whereby appears what\r\nis the competency of human reason to fathom the Divine unsearchableness.\r\nHere is one whom thou deemest the perfection of justice and scrupulous\r\nintegrity; to all-knowing Providence it seems far otherwise. We all know\r\nour Lucan's admonition that it was the winning cause that found favour\r\nwith the gods, the beaten cause with Cato. So, shouldst thou see\r\nanything in this world happening differently from thy expectation, doubt\r\nnot but events are rightly ordered; it is in thy judgment that there is\r\nperverse confusion.\r\n\r\n'Grant, however, there be somewhere found one of so happy a character\r\nthat God and man alike agree in their judgments about him; yet is he\r\nsomewhat infirm in strength of mind. It may be, if he fall into\r\nadversity, he will cease to practise that innocency which has failed to\r\nsecure his fortune. Therefore, God's wise dispensation spares him whom\r\nadversity might make worse, will not let him suffer who is ill fitted\r\nfor endurance. Another there is perfect in all virtue, so holy and nigh\r\nto God that providence judges it unlawful that aught untoward should\r\nbefall him; nay, doth not even permit him to be afflicted with bodily\r\ndisease. As one more excellent than I[N] hath said:\r\n\r\n    '\"The very body of the holy saint\r\n    Is built of purest ether.\"\r\n\r\nOften it happens that the governance is given to the good that a\r\nrestraint may be put upon superfluity of wickedness. To others\r\nprovidence assigns some mixed lot suited to their spiritual nature; some\r\nit will plague lest they grow rank through long prosperity; others it\r\nwill suffer to be vexed with sore afflictions to confirm their virtues\r\nby the exercise and practice of patience. Some fear overmuch what they\r\nhave strength to bear; others despise overmuch that to which their\r\nstrength is unequal. All these it brings to the test of their true self\r\nthrough misfortune. Some also have bought a name revered to future ages\r\nat the price of a glorious death; some by invincible constancy under\r\ntheir sufferings have afforded an example to others that virtue cannot\r\nbe overcome by calamity--all which things, without doubt, come to pass\r\nrightly and in due order, and to the benefit of those to whom they are\r\nseen to happen.\r\n\r\n'As to the other side of the marvel, that the bad now meet with\r\naffliction, now get their hearts' desire, this, too, springs from the\r\nsame causes. As to the afflictions, of course no one marvels, because\r\nall hold the wicked to be ill deserving. The truth is, their punishments\r\nboth frighten others from crime, and amend those on whom they are\r\ninflicted; while their prosperity is a powerful sermon to the good, what\r\njudgments they ought to pass on good fortune of this kind, which often\r\nattends the wicked so assiduously.\r\n\r\n'There is another object which may, I believe, be attained in such\r\ncases: there is one, perhaps, whose nature is so reckless and violent\r\nthat poverty would drive him more desperately into crime. _His_ disorder\r\nprovidence relieves by allowing him to amass money. Such a one, in the\r\nuneasiness of a conscience stained with guilt, while he contrasts his\r\ncharacter with his fortune, perchance grows alarmed lest he should come\r\nto mourn the loss of that whose possession is so pleasant to him. He\r\nwill, then, reform his ways, and through the fear of losing his fortune\r\nhe forsakes his iniquity. Some, through a prosperity unworthily borne,\r\nhave been hurled headlong to ruin; to some the power of the sword has\r\nbeen committed, to the end that the good may be tried by discipline, and\r\nthe bad punished. For while there can be no peace between the righteous\r\nand the wicked, neither can the wicked agree among themselves. How\r\nshould they, when each is at variance with himself, because his vices\r\nrend his conscience, and ofttimes they do things which, when they are\r\ndone, they judge ought not to have been done. Hence it is that this\r\nsupreme providence brings to pass this notable marvel--that the bad make\r\nthe bad good. For some, when they see the injustice which they\r\nthemselves suffer at the hands of evil-doers, are inflamed with\r\ndetestation of the offenders, and, in the endeavour to be unlike those\r\nwhom they hate, return to the ways of virtue. It is the Divine power\r\nalone to which things evil are also good, in that, by putting them to\r\nsuitable use, it bringeth them in the end to some good issue. For order\r\nin some way or other embraceth all things, so that even that which has\r\ndeparted from the appointed laws of the order, nevertheless falleth\r\nwithin _an_ order, though _another_ order, that nothing in the realm of\r\nprovidence may be left to haphazard. But\r\n\r\n     '\"Hard were the task, as a god, to recount all, nothing omitting.\"\r\n\r\nNor, truly, is it lawful for man to compass in thought all the mechanism\r\nof the Divine work, or set it forth in speech. Let us be content to\r\nhave apprehended this only--that God, the creator of universal nature,\r\nlikewise disposeth all things, and guides them to good; and while He\r\nstudies to preserve in likeness to Himself all that He has created, He\r\nbanishes all evil from the borders of His commonweal through the links\r\nof fatal necessity. Whereby it comes to pass that, if thou look to\r\ndisposing providence, thou wilt nowhere find the evils which are\r\nbelieved so to abound on earth.\r\n\r\n'But I see thou hast long been burdened with the weight of the subject,\r\nand fatigued with the prolixity of the argument, and now lookest for\r\nsome refreshment of sweet poesy. Listen, then, and may the draught so\r\nrestore thee that thou wilt bend thy mind more resolutely to what\r\nremains.'\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[N] Parmenides. Boethius seems to forget for the moment that Philosophy\r\nis speaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG VI.\r\n\r\nTHE UNIVERSAL AIM.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Wouldst thou with unclouded mind\r\n    View the laws by God designed,\r\n    Lift thy steadfast gaze on high\r\n    To the starry canopy;\r\n    See in rightful league of love\r\n    All the constellations move.\r\n    Fiery Sol, in full career,\r\n    Ne'er obstructs cold Phoebe's sphere;\r\n    When the Bear, at heaven's height,\r\n    Wheels his coursers' rapid flight,\r\n    Though he sees the starry train\r\n    Sinking in the western main,\r\n    He repines not, nor desires\r\n    In the flood to quench his fires.\r\n\r\n    In true sequence, as decreed,\r\n    Daily morn and eve succeed;\r\n    Vesper brings the shades of night,\r\n    Lucifer the morning light.\r\n    Love, in alternation due,\r\n    Still the cycle doth renew,\r\n    And discordant strife is driven\r\n    From the starry realm of heaven.\r\n    Thus, in wondrous amity,\r\n    Warring elements agree;\r\n    Hot and cold, and moist and dry,\r\n    Lay their ancient quarrel by;\r\n    High the flickering flame ascends,\r\n    Downward earth for ever tends.\r\n\r\n    So the year in spring's mild hours\r\n    Loads the air with scent of flowers;\r\n    Summer paints the golden grain;\r\n    Then, when autumn comes again,\r\n    Bright with fruit the orchards glow;\r\n    Winter brings the rain and snow.\r\n    Thus the seasons' fixed progression,\r\n    Tempered in a due succession,\r\n    Nourishes and brings to birth\r\n    All that lives and breathes on earth.\r\n    Then, soon run life's little day,\r\n    All it brought it takes away.\r\n\r\n    But One sits and guides the reins,\r\n    He who made and all sustains;\r\n    King and Lord and Fountain-head,\r\n    Judge most holy, Law most dread;\r\n    Now impels and now keeps back,\r\n    Holds each waverer in the track.\r\n    Else, were once the power withheld\r\n    That the circling spheres compelled\r\n    In their orbits to revolve,\r\n    This world's order would dissolve,\r\n    And th' harmonious whole would all\r\n    In one hideous ruin fall.\r\n\r\n    But through this connected frame\r\n    Runs one universal aim;\r\n    Towards the Good do all things tend,\r\n    Many paths, but one the end.\r\n    For naught lasts, unless it turns\r\n    Backward in its course, and yearns\r\n    To that Source to flow again\r\n    Whence its being first was ta'en.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Dost thou, then, see the consequence of all that we have said?'\r\n\r\n'Nay; what consequence?'\r\n\r\n'That absolutely every fortune is good fortune.'\r\n\r\n'And how can that be?' said I.\r\n\r\n'Attend,' said she. 'Since every fortune, welcome and unwelcome alike,\r\nhas for its object the reward or trial of the good, and the punishing or\r\namending of the bad, every fortune must be good, since it is either just\r\nor useful.'\r\n\r\n'The reasoning is exceeding true,' said I, 'the conclusion, so long as I\r\nreflect upon the providence and fate of which thou hast taught me, based\r\non a strong foundation. Yet, with thy leave, we will count it among\r\nthose which just now thou didst set down as paradoxical.'\r\n\r\n'And why so?' said she.\r\n\r\n'Because ordinary speech is apt to assert, and that frequently, that\r\nsome men's fortune is bad.'\r\n\r\n'Shall we, then, for awhile approach more nearly to the language of the\r\nvulgar, that we may not seem to have departed too far from the usages of\r\nmen?'\r\n\r\n'At thy good pleasure,' said I.\r\n\r\n'That which advantageth thou callest good, dost thou not?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly.'\r\n\r\n'And that which either tries or amends advantageth?'\r\n\r\n'Granted.'\r\n\r\n'Is good, then?'\r\n\r\n'Of course.'\r\n\r\n'Well, this is _their_ case who have attained virtue and wage war with\r\nadversity, or turn from vice and lay hold on the path of virtue.'\r\n\r\n'I cannot deny it.'\r\n\r\n'What of the good fortune which is given as reward of the good--do the\r\nvulgar adjudge it bad?'\r\n\r\n'Anything but that; they deem it to be the best, as indeed it is.'\r\n\r\n'What, then, of that which remains, which, though it is harsh, puts the\r\nrestraint of just punishment on the bad--does popular opinion deem it\r\ngood?'\r\n\r\n'Nay; of all that can be imagined, it is accounted the most miserable.'\r\n\r\n'Observe, then, if, in following popular opinion, we have not ended in a\r\nconclusion quite paradoxical.'\r\n\r\n'How so?' said I.\r\n\r\n'Why, it results from our admissions that of all who have attained, or\r\nare advancing in, or are aiming at virtue, the fortune is in every case\r\ngood, while for those who remain in their wickedness fortune is always\r\nutterly bad.'\r\n\r\n'It is true,' said I; 'yet no one dare acknowledge it.'\r\n\r\n'Wherefore,' said she, 'the wise man ought not to take it ill, if ever\r\nhe is involved in one of fortune's conflicts, any more than it becomes a\r\nbrave soldier to be offended when at any time the trumpet sounds for\r\nbattle. The time of trial is the express opportunity for the one to win\r\nglory, for the other to perfect his wisdom. Hence, indeed, virtue gets\r\nits name, because, relying on its own efficacy, it yieldeth not to\r\nadversity. And ye who have taken your stand on virtue's steep ascent,\r\nit is not for you to be dissolved in delights or enfeebled by pleasure;\r\nye close in conflict--yea, in conflict most sharp--with all fortune's\r\nvicissitudes, lest ye suffer foul fortune to overwhelm or fair fortune\r\nto corrupt you. Hold the mean with all your strength. Whatever falls\r\nshort of this, or goes beyond, is fraught with scorn of happiness, and\r\nmisses the reward of toil. It rests with you to make your fortune what\r\nyou will. Verily, every harsh-seeming fortune, unless it either\r\ndisciplines or amends, is punishment.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG VII.\r\n\r\nTHE HERO'S PATH.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ten years a tedious warfare raged,\r\n      Ere Ilium's smoking ruins paid\r\n      For wedlock stained and faith betrayed,\r\n    And great Atrides' wrath assuaged.\r\n\r\n    But when heaven's anger asked a life,\r\n      And baffling winds his course withstood,\r\n      The king put off his fatherhood,\r\n    And slew his child with priestly knife.\r\n\r\n    When by the cavern's glimmering light\r\n      His comrades dear Odysseus saw\r\n      In the huge Cyclops' hideous maw\r\n    Engulfed, he wept the piteous sight.\r\n\r\n    But blinded soon, and wild with pain--\r\n      In bitter tears and sore annoy--\r\n      For that foul feast's unholy joy\r\n    Grim Polyphemus paid again.\r\n\r\n    His labours for Alcides win\r\n      A name of glory far and wide;\r\n      He tamed the Centaur's haughty pride,\r\n    And from the lion reft his skin.\r\n\r\n    The foul birds with sure darts he slew;\r\n      The golden fruit he stole--in vain\r\n      The dragon's watch; with triple chain\r\n    From hell's depths Cerberus he drew.\r\n\r\n    With their fierce lord's own flesh he fed\r\n      The wild steeds; Hydra overcame\r\n      With fire.

I. Boethius asks if there is really any such thing as chance.\r\n     Philosophy answers, in conformity with Aristotle's definition\r\n     (Phys., II. iv.), that chance is merely relative to human purpose,\r\n     and that what seems fortuitous really depends on a more subtle form\r\n     of causation.--CH. II. Has man, then, any freedom, if the reign of\r\n     law is thus absolute? Freedom of choice, replies Philosophy, is a\r\n     necessary attribute of reason. Man has a measure of freedom, though\r\n     a less perfect freedom than divine natures.--CH. III. But how can\r\n     man's freedom be reconciled with God's absolute foreknowledge? If\r\n     God's foreknowledge be certain, it seems to exclude the possibility\r\n     of man's free will. But if man has no freedom of choice, it\r\n     follows that rewards and punishments are unjust as well as useless;\r\n     that merit and demerit are mere names; that God is the cause of\r\n     men's wickednesses; that prayer is meaningless.--CH. IV. The\r\n     explanation is that man's reasoning faculties are not adequate to\r\n     the apprehension of the ways of God's foreknowledge. If we could\r\n     know, as He knows, all that is most perplexing in this problem\r\n     would be made plain. For knowledge depends not on the nature of the\r\n     thing known, but on the faculty of the knower.--CH. V. Now, where\r\n     our senses conflict with our reason, we defer the judgment of the\r\n     lower faculty to the judgment of the higher. Our present perplexity\r\n     arises from our viewing God's foreknowledge from the standpoint of\r\n     human reason. We must try and rise to the higher standpoint of\r\n     God's immediate intuition.--CH. VI. To understand this higher form\r\n     of cognition, we must consider God's nature. God is eternal.\r\n     Eternity is more than mere everlasting duration. Accordingly, His\r\n     knowledge surveys past and future in the timelessness of an eternal\r\n     present. His foreseeing is seeing. Yet this foreseeing does not in\r\n     itself impose necessity, any more than our seeing things happen\r\n     makes their happening necessary. We may, however, if we please,\r\n     distinguish two necessities--one absolute, the other conditional on\r\n     knowledge. In this conditional sense alone do the things which God\r\n     foresees necessarily come to pass. But this kind of necessity\r\n     affects not the nature of things. It leaves the reality of free\r\n     will unimpaired, and the evils feared do not ensue. Our\r\n     responsibility is great, since all that we do is done in the sight\r\n     of all-seeing Providence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe ceased, and was about to pass on in her discourse to the exposition\r\nof other matters, when I break in and say: 'Excellent is thine\r\nexhortation, and such as well beseemeth thy high authority; but I am\r\neven now experiencing one of the many difficulties which, as thou saidst\r\nbut now, beset the question of providence. I want to know whether thou\r\ndeemest that there is any such thing as chance at all, and, if so, what\r\nit is.'\r\n\r\nThen she made answer: 'I am anxious to fulfil my promise completely, and\r\nopen to thee a way of return to thy native land. As for these matters,\r\nthough very useful to know, they are yet a little removed from the path\r\nof our design, and I fear lest digressions should fatigue thee, and thou\r\nshouldst find thyself unequal to completing the direct journey to our\r\ngoal.'\r\n\r\n'Have no fear for that,' said I. 'It is rest to me to learn, where\r\nlearning brings delight so exquisite, especially when thy argument has\r\nbeen built up on all sides with undoubted conviction, and no place is\r\nleft for uncertainty in what follows.'\r\n\r\nShe made answer: 'I will accede to thy request;' and forthwith she thus\r\nbegan: 'If chance be defined as a result produced by random movement\r\nwithout any link of causal connection, I roundly affirm that there is no\r\nsuch thing as chance at all, and consider the word to be altogether\r\nwithout meaning, except as a symbol of the thing designated. What place\r\ncan be left for random action, when God constraineth all things to\r\norder? For \"ex nihilo nihil\" is sound doctrine which none of the\r\nancients gainsaid, although they used it of material substance, not of\r\nthe efficient principle; this they laid down as a kind of basis for all\r\ntheir reasonings concerning nature. Now, if a thing arise without\r\ncauses, it will appear to have arisen from nothing. But if this cannot\r\nbe, neither is it possible for there to be chance in accordance with the\r\ndefinition just given.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' said I, 'is there, then, nothing which can properly be called\r\nchance or accident, or is there something to which these names are\r\nappropriate, though its nature is dark to the vulgar?'\r\n\r\n'Our good Aristotle,' says she, 'has defined it concisely in his\r\n\"Physics,\" and closely in accordance with the truth.'\r\n\r\n'How, pray?' said I.\r\n\r\n'Thus,' says she: 'Whenever something is done for the sake of a\r\nparticular end, and for certain reasons some other result than that\r\ndesigned ensues, this is called chance; for instance, if a man is\r\ndigging the earth for tillage, and finds a mass of buried gold. Now,\r\nsuch a find is regarded as accidental; yet it is not \"ex nihilo,\" for it\r\nhas its proper causes, the unforeseen and unexpected concurrence of\r\nwhich has brought the chance about. For had not the cultivator been\r\ndigging, had not the man who hid the money buried it in that precise\r\nspot, the gold would not have been found. These, then, are the reasons\r\nwhy the find is a chance one, in that it results from causes which met\r\ntogether and concurred, not from any intention on the part of the\r\ndiscoverer. Since neither he who buried the gold nor he who worked in\r\nthe field _intended_ that the money should be found, but, as I said, it\r\n_happened_ by coincidence that one dug where the other buried the\r\ntreasure. We may, then, define chance as being an unexpected result\r\nflowing from a concurrence of causes where the several factors had some\r\ndefinite end. But the meeting and concurrence of these causes arises\r\nfrom that inevitable chain of order which, flowing from the\r\nfountain-head of Providence, disposes all things in their due time and\r\nplace.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG I.\r\n\r\nCHANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the rugged Persian highlands,\r\n      Where the masters of the bow\r\n    Skill to feign a flight, and, fleeing,\r\n      Hurl their darts and pierce the foe;\r\n    There the Tigris and Euphrates\r\n      At one source[O] their waters blend,\r\n    Soon to draw apart, and plainward\r\n      Each its separate way to wend.\r\n    When once more their waters mingle\r\n      In a channel deep and wide,\r\n    All the flotsam comes together\r\n      That is borne upon the tide:\r\n    Ships, and trunks of trees, uprooted\r\n      In the torrent's wild career,\r\n    Meet, as 'mid the swirling waters\r\n      Chance their random way may steer.\r\n    Yet the shelving of the channel\r\n      And the flowing water's force\r\n    Guides each movement, and determines\r\n      Every floating fragment's course.\r\n    Thus, where'er the drift of hazard\r\n      Seems most unrestrained to flow,\r\n    Chance herself is reined and bitted,\r\n      And the curb of law doth know.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[O] This is not, of course, literally true, though the Tigris and\r\nEuphrates rise in the same mountain district.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\n'I am following needfully,' said I, 'and I agree that it is as thou\r\nsayest. But in this series of linked causes is there any freedom left to\r\nour will, or does the chain of fate bind also the very motions of our\r\nsouls?'\r\n\r\n'There is freedom,' said she; 'nor, indeed, can any creature be\r\nrational, unless he be endowed with free will. For that which hath the\r\nnatural use of reason has the faculty of discriminative judgment, and of\r\nitself distinguishes what is to be shunned or desired. Now, everyone\r\nseeks what he judges desirable, and avoids what he thinks should be\r\nshunned. Wherefore, beings endowed with reason possess also the faculty\r\nof free choice and refusal. But I suppose this faculty not equal alike\r\nin all. The higher Divine essences possess a clear-sighted judgment, an\r\nuncorrupt will, and an effective power of accomplishing their wishes.\r\nHuman souls must needs be comparatively free while they abide in the\r\ncontemplation of the Divine mind, less free when they pass into bodily\r\nform, and still less, again, when they are enwrapped in earthly members.\r\nBut when they are given over to vices, and fall from the possession of\r\ntheir proper reason, then indeed their condition is utter slavery. For\r\nwhen they let their gaze fall from the light of highest truth to the\r\nlower world where darkness reigns, soon ignorance blinds their vision;\r\nthey are disturbed by baneful affections, by yielding and assenting to\r\nwhich they help to promote the slavery in which they are involved, and\r\nare in a manner led captive by reason of their very liberty. Yet He who\r\nseeth all things from eternity beholdeth these things with the eyes of\r\nHis providence, and assigneth to each what is predestined for it by its\r\nmerits:\r\n\r\n     '\"All things surveying, all things overhearing.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG II.\r\n\r\nTHE TRUE SUN.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Homer with mellifluous tongue\r\n    Phoebus' glorious light hath sung,\r\n      Hymning high his praise;\r\n      Yet _his_ feeble rays\r\n    Ocean's hollows may not brighten,\r\n    Nor earth's central gloom enlighten.\r\n\r\n    But the might of Him, who skilled\r\n    This great universe to build,\r\n      Is not thus confined;\r\n      Not earth's solid rind,\r\n    Nor night's blackest canopy,\r\n    Baffle His all-seeing eye.\r\n\r\n    All that is, hath been, shall be,\r\n    In one glance's compass, He\r\n      Limitless descries;\r\n      And, save His, no eyes\r\n    All the world survey--no, none!\r\n    _Him_, then, truly name the Sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen said I: 'But now I am once more perplexed by a problem yet more\r\ndifficult.'\r\n\r\n'And what is that?' said she; 'yet, in truth, I can guess what it is\r\nthat troubles you.'\r\n\r\n'It seems,' said I, 'too much of a paradox and a contradiction that God\r\nshould know all things, and yet there should be free will. For if God\r\nforesees everything, and can in no wise be deceived, that which\r\nprovidence foresees to be about to happen must necessarily come to pass.\r\nWherefore, if from eternity He foreknows not only what men will do, but\r\nalso their designs and purposes, there can be no freedom of the will,\r\nseeing that nothing can be done, nor can any sort of purpose be\r\nentertained, save such as a Divine providence, incapable of being\r\ndeceived, has perceived beforehand. For if the issues can be turned\r\naside to some other end than that foreseen by providence, there will not\r\nthen be any sure foreknowledge of the future, but uncertain conjecture\r\ninstead, and to think this of God I deem impiety.\r\n\r\n'Moreover, I do not approve the reasoning by which some think to solve\r\nthis puzzle. For they say that it is not because God has foreseen the\r\ncoming of an event that _therefore_ it is sure to come to pass, but,\r\nconversely, because something is about to come to pass, it cannot be\r\nhidden from Divine providence; and accordingly the necessity passes to\r\nthe opposite side, and it is not that what is foreseen must necessarily\r\ncome to pass, but that what is about to come to pass must necessarily be\r\nforeseen. But this is just as if the matter in debate were, which is\r\ncause and which effect--whether foreknowledge of the future cause of the\r\nnecessity, or the necessity of the future of the foreknowledge. But we\r\nneed not be at the pains of demonstrating that, whatsoever be the order\r\nof the causal sequence, the occurrence of things foreseen is necessary,\r\neven though the foreknowledge of future events does not in itself\r\nimpose upon them the necessity of their occurrence. For example, if a\r\nman be seated, the supposition of his being seated is necessarily true;\r\nand, conversely, if the supposition of his being seated is true, because\r\nhe is really seated, he must necessarily be sitting. So, in either case,\r\nthere is some necessity involved--in this latter case, the necessity of\r\nthe fact; in the former, of the truth of the statement. But in both\r\ncases the sitter is not therefore seated because the opinion is true,\r\nbut rather the opinion is true because antecedently he was sitting as a\r\nmatter of fact. Thus, though the cause of the truth of the opinion comes\r\nfrom the other side,[P] yet there is a necessity on both sides alike. We\r\ncan obviously reason similarly in the case of providence and the future.\r\nEven if future events are foreseen because they are about to happen, and\r\ndo not come to pass because they are foreseen, still, all the same,\r\nthere is a necessity, both that they should be foreseen by God as about\r\nto come to pass, and that when they are foreseen they should happen, and\r\nthis is sufficient for the destruction of free will. However, it is\r\npreposterous to speak of the occurrence of events in time as the cause\r\nof eternal foreknowledge. And yet if we believe that God foresees future\r\nevents because they are about to come to pass, what is it but to think\r\nthat the occurrence of events is the cause of His supreme providence?\r\nFurther, just as when I _know_ that anything is, that thing\r\n_necessarily_ is, so when I know that anything will be, it will\r\n_necessarily_ be. It follows, then, that things foreknown come to pass\r\ninevitably.\r\n\r\n'Lastly, to think of a thing as being in any way other than what it is,\r\nis not only not knowledge, but it is false opinion widely different from\r\nthe truth of knowledge. Consequently, if anything is about to be, and\r\nyet its occurrence is not certain and necessary, how can anyone foreknow\r\nthat it will occur? For just as knowledge itself is free from all\r\nadmixture of falsity, so any conception drawn from knowledge cannot be\r\nother than as it is conceived. For this, indeed, is the cause why\r\nknowledge is free from falsehood, because of necessity each thing must\r\ncorrespond exactly with the knowledge which grasps its nature. In what\r\nway, then, are we to suppose that God foreknows these uncertainties as\r\nabout to come to pass? For if He thinks of events which possibly may not\r\nhappen at all as inevitably destined to come to pass, He is deceived;\r\nand this it is not only impious to believe, but even so much as to\r\nexpress in words. If, on the other hand, He sees them in the future as\r\nthey are in such a sense as to know that they may equally come to pass\r\nor not, what sort of foreknowledge is this which comprehends nothing\r\ncertain nor fixed? What better is this than the absurd vaticination of\r\nTeiresias?\r\n\r\n      '\"Whate'er I say\r\n    Shall either come to pass--or not.\"\r\n\r\nIn that case, too, in what would Divine providence surpass human opinion\r\nif it holds for uncertain things the occurrence of which is uncertain,\r\neven as men do? But if at that perfectly sure Fountain-head of all\r\nthings no shadow of uncertainty can possibly be found, then the\r\noccurrence of those things which He has surely foreknown as coming is\r\ncertain. Wherefore there can be no freedom in human actions and designs;\r\nbut the Divine mind, which foresees all things without possibility of\r\nmistake, ties and binds them down to one only issue. But this admission\r\nonce made, what an upset of human affairs manifestly ensues! Vainly are\r\nrewards and punishments proposed for the good and bad, since no free and\r\nvoluntary motion of the will has deserved either one or the other; nay,\r\nthe punishment of the wicked and the reward of the righteous, which is\r\nnow esteemed the perfection of justice, will seem the most flagrant\r\ninjustice, since men are determined either way not by their own proper\r\nvolition, but by the necessity of what must surely be. And therefore\r\nneither virtue nor vice is anything, but rather good and ill desert are\r\nconfounded together without distinction. Moreover, seeing that the whole\r\ncourse of events is deduced from providence, and nothing is left free to\r\nhuman design, it comes to pass that our vices also are referred to the\r\nAuthor of all good--a thought than which none more abominable can\r\npossibly be conceived. Again, no ground is left for hope or prayer,\r\nsince how can we hope for blessings, or pray for mercy, when every\r\nobject of desire depends upon the links of an unalterable chain of\r\ncausation? Gone, then, is the one means of intercourse between God and\r\nman--the communion of hope and prayer--if it be true that we ever earn\r\nthe inestimable recompense of the Divine favour at the price of a due\r\nhumility; for this is the one way whereby men seem able to hold\r\ncommunion with God, and are joined to that unapproachable light by the\r\nvery act of supplication, even before they obtain their petitions. Then,\r\nsince these things can scarcely be believed to have any efficacy, if the\r\nnecessity of future events be admitted, what means will there be whereby\r\nwe may be brought near and cleave to Him who is the supreme Head of all?\r\nWherefore it needs must be that the human race, even as thou didst\r\nerstwhile declare in song, parted and dissevered from its Source, should\r\nfall to ruin.'\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[P] _I.e._, the necessity of the truth of the statement from the fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG III.\r\n\r\nTRUTH'S PARADOXES.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Why does a strange discordance break\r\n      The ordered scheme's fair harmony?\r\n    Hath God decreed 'twixt truth and truth\r\n      There may such lasting warfare be,\r\n    That truths, each severally plain,\r\n    We strive to reconcile in vain?\r\n\r\n    Or is the discord not in truth,\r\n      Since truth is self consistent ever?\r\n    But, close in fleshly wrappings held,\r\n      The blinded mind of man can never\r\n    Discern--so faint her taper shines--\r\n    The subtle chain that all combines?\r\n\r\n    Ah! then why burns man's restless mind\r\n      Truth's hidden portals to unclose?\r\n    Knows he already what he seeks?\r\n      Why toil to seek it, if he knows?\r\n    Yet, haply if he knoweth not,\r\n    Why blindly seek he knows not what?[Q]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Who for a good he knows not sighs?\r\n      Who can an unknown end pursue?\r\n    How find?

And the reason of this obscurity\r\nis that the movement of human reasoning cannot cope with the simplicity\r\nof the Divine foreknowledge; for if a conception of its nature could in\r\nany wise be framed, no shadow of uncertainty would remain. With a view\r\nof making this at last clear and plain, I will begin by considering the\r\narguments by which thou art swayed. First, I inquire into the reasons\r\nwhy thou art dissatisfied with the solution proposed, which is to the\r\neffect that, seeing the fact of foreknowledge is not thought the cause\r\nof the necessity of future events, foreknowledge is not to be deemed any\r\nhindrance to the freedom of the will. Now, surely the sole ground on\r\nwhich thou arguest the necessity of the future is that things which are\r\nforeknown cannot fail to come to pass. But if, as thou wert ready to\r\nacknowledge just now, the fact of foreknowledge imposes no necessity on\r\nthings future, what reason is there for supposing the results of\r\nvoluntary action constrained to a fixed issue? Suppose, for the sake of\r\nargument, and to see what follows, we assume that there is no\r\nforeknowledge. Are willed actions, then, tied down to any necessity in\r\n_this_ case?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly not.'\r\n\r\n'Let us assume foreknowledge again, but without its involving any actual\r\nnecessity; the freedom of the will, I imagine, will remain in complete\r\nintegrity. But thou wilt say that, even although the foreknowledge is\r\nnot the necessity of the future event's occurrence, yet it is a sign\r\nthat it will necessarily happen. Granted; but in this case it is plain\r\nthat, even if there had been no foreknowledge, the issues would have\r\nbeen inevitably certain. For a sign only indicates something which is,\r\ndoes not bring to pass that of which it is the sign. We require to show\r\nbeforehand that all things, without exception, happen of necessity in\r\norder that a preconception may be a sign of this necessity. Otherwise,\r\nif there is no such universal necessity, neither can any preconception\r\nbe a sign of a necessity which exists not. Manifestly, too, a proof\r\nestablished on firm grounds of reason must be drawn not from signs and\r\nloose general arguments, but from suitable and necessary causes. But how\r\ncan it be that things foreseen should ever fail to come to pass? Why,\r\nthis is to suppose us to believe that the events which providence\r\nforesees to be coming were not about to happen, instead of our supposing\r\nthat, although they should come to pass, yet there was no necessity\r\ninvolved in their own nature compelling their occurrence. Take an\r\nillustration that will help to convey my meaning. There are many things\r\nwhich we see taking place before our eyes--the movements of charioteers,\r\nfor instance, in guiding and turning their cars, and so on. Now, is any\r\none of these movements compelled by any necessity?'\r\n\r\n'No; certainly not. There would be no efficacy in skill if all motions\r\ntook place perforce.'\r\n\r\n'Then, things which in taking place are free from any necessity as to\r\ntheir being in the present must also, before they take place, be about\r\nto happen without necessity. Wherefore there are things which will come\r\nto pass, the occurrence of which is perfectly free from necessity. At\r\nall events, I imagine that no one will deny that things now taking place\r\nwere about to come to pass before they were actually happening. Such\r\nthings, however much foreknown, are in their occurrence _free_. For even\r\nas knowledge of things present imports no necessity into things that are\r\ntaking place, so foreknowledge of the future imports none into things\r\nthat are about to come. But this, thou wilt say, is the very point in\r\ndispute--whether any foreknowing is possible of things whose occurrence\r\nis not necessary. For here there seems to thee a contradiction, and, if\r\nthey are foreseen, their necessity follows; whereas if there is no\r\nnecessity, they can by no means be foreknown; and thou thinkest that\r\nnothing can be grasped as known unless it is certain, but if things\r\nwhose occurrence is uncertain are foreknown as certain, this is the very\r\nmist of opinion, not the truth of knowledge. For to think of things\r\notherwise than as they are, thou believest to be incompatible with the\r\nsoundness of knowledge.\r\n\r\n'Now, the cause of the mistake is this--that men think that all\r\nknowledge is cognized purely by the nature and efficacy of the thing\r\nknown. Whereas the case is the very reverse: all that is known is\r\ngrasped not conformably to its own efficacy, but rather conformably to\r\nthe faculty of the knower. An example will make this clear: the\r\nroundness of a body is recognised in one way by sight, in another by\r\ntouch. Sight looks upon it from a distance as a whole by a simultaneous\r\nreflection of rays; touch grasps the roundness piecemeal, by contact and\r\nattachment to the surface, and by actual movement round the periphery\r\nitself. Man himself, likewise, is viewed in one way by Sense, in another\r\nby Imagination, in another way, again, by Thought, in another by pure\r\nIntelligence. Sense judges figure clothed in material substance,\r\nImagination figure alone without matter. Thought transcends this again,\r\nand by its contemplation of universals considers the type itself which\r\nis contained in the individual. The eye of Intelligence is yet more\r\nexalted; for overpassing the sphere of the universal, it will behold\r\nabsolute form itself by the pure force of the mind's vision. Wherein the\r\nmain point to be considered is this: the higher faculty of comprehension\r\nembraces the lower, while the lower cannot rise to the higher. For Sense\r\nhas no efficacy beyond matter, nor can Imagination behold universal\r\nideas, nor Thought embrace pure form; but Intelligence, looking down, as\r\nit were, from its higher standpoint in its intuition of form,\r\ndiscriminates also the several elements which underlie it; but it\r\ncomprehends them in the same way as it comprehends that form itself,\r\nwhich could be cognized by no other than itself. For it cognizes the\r\nuniversal of Thought, the figure of Imagination, and the matter of\r\nSense, without employing Thought, Imagination, or Sense, but surveying\r\nall things, so to speak, under the aspect of pure form by a single flash\r\nof intuition. Thought also, in considering the universal, embraces\r\nimages and sense-impressions without resorting to Imagination or Sense.\r\nFor it is Thought which has thus defined the universal from its\r\nconceptual point of view: \"Man is a two-legged animal endowed with\r\nreason.\" This is indeed a universal notion, yet no one is ignorant that\r\nthe _thing_ is imaginable and presentable to Sense, because Thought\r\nconsiders it not by Imagination or Sense, but by means of rational\r\nconception. Imagination, too, though its faculty of viewing and forming\r\nrepresentations is founded upon the senses, nevertheless surveys\r\nsense-impressions without calling in Sense, not in the way of\r\nSense-perception, but of Imagination. See'st thou, then, how all things\r\nin cognizing use rather their own faculty than the faculty of the things\r\nwhich they cognize? Nor is this strange; for since every judgment is the\r\nact of the judge, it is necessary that each should accomplish its task\r\nby its own, not by another's power.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG IV.\r\n\r\nA PSYCHOLOGICAL FALLACY.[R]\r\n\r\n\r\n    From the Porch's murky depths\r\n      Comes a doctrine sage,\r\n    That doth liken living mind\r\n      To a written page;\r\n    Since all knowledge comes through\r\n      Sense,\r\n    Graven by Experience.\r\n\r\n    'As,' say they, 'the pen its marks\r\n      Curiously doth trace\r\n    On the smooth unsullied white\r\n      Of the paper's face,\r\n    So do outer things impress\r\n    Images on consciousness.'\r\n\r\n    But if verily the mind\r\n      Thus all passive lies;\r\n    If no living power within\r\n      Its own force supplies;\r\n    If it but reflect again,\r\n    Like a glass, things false and vain--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Whence the wondrous faculty\r\n      That perceives and knows,\r\n    That in one fair ordered scheme\r\n      Doth the world dispose;\r\n    Grasps each whole that Sense presents,\r\n    Or breaks into elements?\r\n\r\n    So divides and recombines,\r\n      And in changeful wise\r\n    Now to low descends, and now\r\n      To the height doth rise;\r\n    Last in inward swift review\r\n    Strictly sifts the false and true?\r\n\r\n    Of these ample potencies\r\n      Fitter cause, I ween,\r\n    Were Mind's self than marks impressed\r\n      By the outer scene.\r\n    Yet the body through the sense\r\n    Stirs the soul's intelligence.\r\n\r\n    When light flashes on the eye,\r\n      Or sound strikes the ear,\r\n    Mind aroused to due response\r\n      Makes the message clear;\r\n    And the dumb external signs\r\n    With the hidden forms combines.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[R] A criticism of the doctrine of the mind as a blank sheet of paper on\r\nwhich experience writes, as held by the Stoics in anticipation of Locke.\r\nSee Zeller, 'Stoics, Epicureans, and Sceptics,' Reichel's translation,\r\np. 76.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Now, although in the case of bodies endowed with sentiency the\r\nqualities of external objects affect the sense-organs, and the activity\r\nof mind is preceded by a bodily affection which calls forth the mind's\r\naction upon itself, and stimulates the forms till that moment lying\r\ninactive within, yet, I say, if in these bodies endowed with sentiency\r\nthe mind is not inscribed by mere passive affection, but of its own\r\nefficacy discriminates the impressions furnished to the body, how much\r\nmore do intelligences free from all bodily affections employ in their\r\ndiscrimination their own mental activities instead of conforming to\r\nexternal objects? So on these principles various modes of cognition\r\nbelong to distinct and different substances. For to creatures void of\r\nmotive power--shell-fish and other such creatures which cling to rocks\r\nand grow there--belongs Sense alone, void of all other modes of gaining\r\nknowledge; to beasts endowed with movement, in whom some capacity of\r\nseeking and shunning seems to have arisen, Imagination also. Thought\r\npertains only to the human race, as Intelligence to Divinity alone;\r\nhence it follows that that form of knowledge exceeds the rest which of\r\nits own nature cognizes not only its proper object, but the objects of\r\nthe other forms of knowledge also. But what if Sense and Imagination\r\nwere to gainsay Thought, and declare that universal which Thought deems\r\nitself to behold to be nothing? For the object of Sense and Imagination\r\ncannot be universal; so that either the judgment of Reason is true and\r\nthere is no sense-object, or, since they know full well that many\r\nobjects are presented to Sense and Imagination, the conception of\r\nReason, which looks on that which is perceived by Sense and particular\r\nas if it were a something \"universal,\" is empty of content. Suppose,\r\nfurther, that Reason maintains in reply that it does indeed contemplate\r\nthe object of both Sense and Imagination under the form of\r\nuniversality, while Sense and Imagination cannot aspire to the\r\nknowledge of the universal, since their cognizance cannot go beyond\r\nbodily figures, and that in the cognition of reality we ought rather to\r\ntrust the stronger and more perfect faculty of judgment. In a dispute of\r\nthis sort, should not we, in whom is planted the faculty of reasoning as\r\nwell as of imagining and perceiving, espouse the cause of Reason?\r\n\r\n'In like manner is it that human reason thinks that Divine Intelligence\r\ncannot see the future except after the fashion in which its own\r\nknowledge is obtained. For thy contention is, if events do not appear to\r\ninvolve certain and necessary issues, they cannot be foreseen as\r\ncertainly about to come to pass. There is, then, no foreknowledge of\r\nsuch events; or, if we can ever bring ourselves to believe that there\r\nis, there can be nothing which does not happen of necessity. If,\r\nhowever, we could have some part in the judgment of the Divine mind,\r\neven as we participate in Reason, we should think it perfectly just that\r\nhuman Reason should submit itself to the Divine mind, no less than we\r\njudged that Imagination and Sense ought to yield to Reason. Wherefore\r\nlet us soar, if we can, to the heights of that Supreme Intelligence; for\r\nthere Reason will see what in itself it cannot look upon; and that is in\r\nwhat way things whose occurrence is not certain may yet be seen in a\r\nsure and definite foreknowledge; and that this foreknowledge is not\r\nconjecture, but rather knowledge in its supreme simplicity, free of all\r\nlimits and restrictions.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG V.\r\n\r\nTHE UPWARD LOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In what divers shapes and fashions do the creatures great and small\r\n    Over wide earth's teeming surface skim, or scud, or walk, or crawl!\r\n    Some with elongated body sweep the ground, and, as they move,\r\n    Trail perforce with writhing belly in the dust a sinuous groove;\r\n    Some, on light wing upward soaring, swiftly do the winds divide,\r\n    And through heaven's ample spaces in free motion smoothly glide;\r\n    These earth's solid surface pressing, with firm paces onward rove,\r\n    Ranging through the verdant meadows, crouching in the woodland grove.\r\n    Great and wondrous is their variance! Yet in all the head low-bent\r\n    Dulls the soul and blunts the senses, though their forms be different.\r\n    Man alone, erect, aspiring, lifts his forehead to the skies,\r\n    And in upright posture steadfast seems earth's baseness to despise.\r\n    If with earth not all besotted, to this parable give ear,\r\n    Thou whose gaze is fixed on heaven, who thy face on high dost rear:\r\n    Lift thy soul, too, heavenward; haply lest it stain its heavenly worth,\r\n    And thine eyes alone look upward, while thy mind cleaves to the earth!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Since, then, as we lately proved, everything that is known is cognized\r\nnot in accordance with its own nature, but in accordance with the nature\r\nof the faculty that comprehends it, let us now contemplate, as far as\r\nlawful, the character of the Divine essence, that we may be able to\r\nunderstand also the nature of its knowledge.\r\n\r\n'God is eternal; in this judgment all rational beings agree. Let us,\r\nthen, consider what eternity is. For this word carries with it a\r\nrevelation alike of the Divine nature and of the Divine knowledge. Now,\r\neternity is the possession of endless life whole and perfect at a single\r\nmoment. What this is becomes more clear and manifest from a comparison\r\nwith things temporal. For whatever lives in time is a present proceeding\r\nfrom the past to the future, and there is nothing set in time which can\r\nembrace the whole space of its life together. To-morrow's state it\r\ngrasps not yet, while it has already lost yesterday's; nay, even in the\r\nlife of to-day ye live no longer than one brief transitory moment.\r\nWhatever, therefore, is subject to the condition of time, although, as\r\nAristotle deemed of the world, it never have either beginning or end,\r\nand its life be stretched to the whole extent of time's infinity, it yet\r\nis not such as rightly to be thought eternal. For it does not include\r\nand embrace the whole space of infinite life at once, but has no present\r\nhold on things to come, not yet accomplished. Accordingly, that which\r\nincludes and possesses the whole fulness of unending life at once, from\r\nwhich nothing future is absent, from which nothing past has escaped,\r\nthis is rightly called eternal; this must of necessity be ever present\r\nto itself in full self-possession, and hold the infinity of movable time\r\nin an abiding present. Wherefore they deem not rightly who imagine that\r\non Plato's principles the created world is made co-eternal with the\r\nCreator, because they are told that he believed the world to have had\r\nno beginning in time,[S] and to be destined never to come to an end. For\r\nit is one thing for existence to be endlessly prolonged, which was what\r\nPlato ascribed to the world, another for the whole of an endless life to\r\nbe embraced in the present, which is manifestly a property peculiar to\r\nthe Divine mind. Nor need God appear earlier in mere duration of time to\r\ncreated things, but only prior in the unique simplicity of His nature.\r\nFor the infinite progression of things in time copies this immediate\r\nexistence in the present of the changeless life, and when it cannot\r\nsucceed in equalling it, declines from movelessness into motion, and\r\nfalls away from the simplicity of a perpetual present to the infinite\r\nduration of the future and the past; and since it cannot possess the\r\nwhole fulness of its life together, for the very reason that in a manner\r\nit never ceases to be, it seems, up to a certain point, to rival that\r\nwhich it cannot complete and express by attaching itself indifferently\r\nto any present moment of time, however swift and brief; and since this\r\nbears some resemblance to that ever-abiding present, it bestows on\r\neverything to which it is assigned the semblance of existence. But since\r\nit cannot abide, it hurries along the infinite path of time, and the\r\nresult has been that it continues by ceaseless movement the life the\r\ncompleteness of which it could not embrace while it stood still. So, if\r\nwe are minded to give things their right names, we shall follow Plato in\r\nsaying that God indeed is eternal, but the world everlasting.\r\n\r\n'Since, then, every mode of judgment comprehends its objects conformably\r\nto its own nature, and since God abides for ever in an eternal present,\r\nHis knowledge, also transcending all movement of time, dwells in the\r\nsimplicity of its own changeless present, and, embracing the whole\r\ninfinite sweep of the past and of the future, contemplates all that\r\nfalls within its simple cognition as if it were now taking place. And\r\ntherefore, if thou wilt carefully consider that immediate presentment\r\nwhereby it discriminates all things, thou wilt more rightly deem it not\r\nforeknowledge as of something future, but knowledge of a moment that\r\nnever passes. For this cause the name chosen to describe it is not\r\nprevision, but providence, because, since utterly removed in nature from\r\nthings mean and trivial, its outlook embraces all things as from some\r\nlofty height. Why, then, dost thou insist that the things which are\r\nsurveyed by the Divine eye are involved in necessity, whereas clearly\r\nmen impose no necessity on things which they see? Does the act of vision\r\nadd any necessity to the things which thou seest before thy eyes?'\r\n\r\n'Assuredly not.'\r\n\r\n'And yet, if we may without unfitness compare God's present and man's,\r\njust as ye see certain things in this your temporary present, so does He\r\nsee all things in His eternal present. Wherefore this Divine\r\nanticipation changes not the natures and properties of things, and it\r\nbeholds things present before it, just as they will hereafter come to\r\npass in time. Nor does it confound things in its judgment, but in the\r\none mental view distinguishes alike what will come necessarily and what\r\nwithout necessity. For even as ye, when at one and the same time ye see\r\na man walking on the earth and the sun rising in the sky, distinguish\r\nbetween the two, though one glance embraces both, and judge the former\r\nvoluntary, the latter necessary action: so also the Divine vision in its\r\nuniversal range of view does in no wise confuse the characters of the\r\nthings which are present to its regard, though future in respect of\r\ntime. Whence it follows that when it perceives that something will come\r\ninto existence, and yet is perfectly aware that this is unbound by any\r\nnecessity, its apprehension is not opinion, but rather knowledge based\r\non truth. And if to this thou sayest that what God sees to be about to\r\ncome to pass cannot fail to come to pass, and that what cannot fail to\r\ncome to pass happens of necessity, and wilt tie me down to this word\r\nnecessity, I will acknowledge that thou affirmest a most solid truth,\r\nbut one which scarcely anyone can approach to who has not made the\r\nDivine his special study. For my answer would be that the same future\r\nevent is necessary from the standpoint of Divine knowledge, but when\r\nconsidered in its own nature it seems absolutely free and unfettered.\r\nSo, then, there are two necessities--one simple, as that men are\r\nnecessarily mortal; the other conditioned, as that, if you know that\r\nsomeone is walking, he must necessarily be walking. For that which is\r\nknown cannot indeed be otherwise than as it is known to be, and yet this\r\nfact by no means carries with it that other simple necessity. For the\r\nformer necessity is not imposed by the thing's own proper nature, but by\r\nthe addition of a condition. No necessity compels one who is voluntarily\r\nwalking to go forward, although it is necessary for him to go forward at\r\nthe moment of walking. In the same way, then, if Providence sees\r\nanything as present, that must necessarily be, though it is bound by no\r\nnecessity of nature. Now, God views as present those coming events which\r\nhappen of free will. These, accordingly, from the standpoint of the\r\nDivine vision are made necessary conditionally on the Divine\r\ncognizance; viewed, however, in themselves, they desist not from the\r\nabsolute freedom naturally theirs. Accordingly, without doubt, all\r\nthings will come to pass which God foreknows as about to happen, but of\r\nthese certain proceed of free will; and though these happen, yet by the\r\nfact of their existence they do not lose their proper nature, in virtue\r\nof which before they happened it was really possible that they might not\r\nhave come to pass.\r\n\r\n'What difference, then, does the denial of necessity make, since,\r\nthrough their being conditioned by Divine knowledge, they come to pass\r\nas if they were in all respects under the compulsion of necessity? This\r\ndifference, surely, which we saw in the case of the instances I formerly\r\ntook, the sun's rising and the man's walking; which at the moment of\r\ntheir occurrence could not but be taking place, and yet one of them\r\nbefore it took place was necessarily obliged to be, while the other was\r\nnot so at all. So likewise the things which to God are present without\r\ndoubt exist, but some of them come from the necessity of things, others\r\nfrom the power of the agent. Quite rightly, then, have we said that\r\nthese things are necessary if viewed from the standpoint of the Divine\r\nknowledge; but if they are considered in themselves, they are free from\r\nthe bonds of necessity, even as everything which is accessible to sense,\r\nregarded from the standpoint of Thought, is universal, but viewed in its\r\nown nature particular. \"But,\" thou wilt say, \"if it is in my power to\r\nchange my purpose, I shall make void providence, since I shall perchance\r\nchange something which comes within its foreknowledge.\" My answer is:\r\nThou canst indeed turn aside thy purpose; but since the truth of\r\nprovidence is ever at hand to see that thou canst, and whether thou\r\ndost, and whither thou turnest thyself, thou canst not avoid the Divine\r\nforeknowledge, even as thou canst not escape the sight of a present\r\nspectator, although of thy free will thou turn thyself to various\r\nactions. Wilt thou, then, say: \"Shall the Divine knowledge be changed at\r\nmy discretion, so that, when I will this or that, providence changes its\r\nknowledge correspondingly?\"\r\n\r\n'Surely not.'\r\n\r\n'True, for the Divine vision anticipates all that is coming, and\r\ntransforms and reduces it to the form of its own present knowledge, and\r\nvaries not, as thou deemest, in its foreknowledge, alternating to this\r\nor that, but in a single flash it forestalls and includes thy mutations\r\nwithout altering. And this ever-present comprehension and survey of all\r\nthings God has received, not from the issue of future events, but from\r\nthe simplicity of His own nature. Hereby also is resolved the objection\r\nwhich a little while ago gave thee offence--that our doings in the\r\nfuture were spoken of as if supplying the cause of God's knowledge. For\r\nthis faculty of knowledge, embracing all things in its immediate\r\ncognizance, has itself fixed the bounds of all things, yet itself owes\r\nnothing to what comes after.\r\n\r\n'And all this being so, the freedom of man's will stands unshaken, and\r\nlaws are not unrighteous, since their rewards and punishments are held\r\nforth to wills unbound by any necessity. God, who foreknoweth all\r\nthings, still looks down from above, and the ever-present eternity of\r\nHis vision concurs with the future character of all our acts, and\r\ndispenseth to the good rewards, to the bad punishments. Our hopes and\r\nprayers also are not fixed on God in vain, and when they are rightly\r\ndirected cannot fail of effect. Therefore, withstand vice, practise\r\nvirtue, lift up your souls to right hopes, offer humble prayers to\r\nHeaven. Great is the necessity of righteousness laid upon you if ye will\r\nnot hide it from yourselves, seeing that all your actions are done\r\nbefore the eyes of a Judge who seeth all things.'\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[S] Plato expressly states the opposite in the 'Timæus' (28B), though\r\npossibly there the account of the beginning of the world in time is to\r\nbe understood figuratively, not literally. See Jowett, vol. iii., pp.\r\n448, 449 (3rd edit.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin a short time of writing 'The Consolation of Philosophy,' Boethius\r\ndied by a cruel death. As to the manner of his death there is some\r\nuncertainty. According to one account, he was cut down by the swords of\r\nthe soldiers before the very judgment-seat of Theodoric; according to\r\nanother, a cord was first fastened round his forehead, and tightened\r\ntill 'his eyes started'; he was then killed with a club.\r\n\r\n_Elliot Stock, Paternoster Row, London_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES TO QUOTATIONS IN THE TEXT.\r\n\r\nBk.
