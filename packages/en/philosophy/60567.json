The volume of which it forms a part is\r\nnumbered MS. 253 in the valuable library of the Marquis of Bath at\r\nLongleat, but how or when it found its way thither it is impossible to\r\nsay. There is little doubt, however, that it was acquired at least as\r\nearly as the time of Thomas Thynne, first Viscount Weymouth, who died in\r\n1714, and it is not unlikely that it has been at Longleat ever since the\r\nhouse was built by Sir John Thynne in the latter part of the 16th\r\ncentury. It is a small vellum folio, 9¾ inches by 7, in modern binding,\r\nand in its present state it consists of ninety-five leaves, the first\r\nseventy-five of which are occupied by the work in question and the\r\nremainder by an English poem or series of poems, probably also\r\ntranslated from the French, in which love is compared with the growth of\r\na tree. The hand appears to be the same throughout and of a date about\r\nthe middle of the 15th century. As may be seen from the page here\r\nreproduced (_cf._ p. 33), it is fairly neat and regular, but it is\r\nhardly the hand of a professional book-scribe, the type being that more\r\ncommonly found in correspondence and business documents of the period.\r\nAs to ornament, there is none whatever; for, although blank spaces were\r\nleft for rubrics and initials, and in a few instances apparently for\r\nminiatures as well, for some reason they were never filled in. But the\r\ndeficiencies of the MS. in this respect are of less practical importance\r\nthan the mutilation inflicted later upon the text. In the main article,\r\nand consequently in this edition of it, there are two lacunæ, one of a\r\nsingle leaf (p. 13) and the other of a whole quire of eight (p. 53),\r\nwhile the supplementary matter has been shorn both of its first leaf and\r\nof an unknown number at the end. Nor is the mischief confined to the\r\nloss of these portions of the text. Probably, as in the case of another\r\nwork by the same translator,[1] there was a colophon which would have\r\ngiven interesting particulars of the origin of the whole MS., and\r\nunfortunately this also has perished. As the translator has been\r\nidentified and as specimens of his handwriting are available for\r\ncomparison,[2] the question whether the copy is in his autograph is\r\neasily decided in the negative, but beyond this little can be\r\nascertained of its history. For reasons which will appear further on it\r\nis a tempting supposition that it is the “Boke de Othea, text and\r\nglose ... in quayers” (_sc._ quires), which is included in an “Inventory\r\noff Englysshe boks” belonging to John Paston the younger (?) in the time\r\nof Edward IV. (after 1474).[3] If, however, the latter MS. in its turn\r\nwas identical with the “Othea pistill” which one William Ebesham wrote\r\nfor Sir John Paston at a cost of 7sh. 2d. about 1469,[4] it contained no\r\nmore than forty-three leaves. In the margin of f. 75b is an entry, made\r\nabout 1500, of a certificate of the banns of marriage, real or\r\nimaginary, of William Stretford and Joyce Helle, the certifying minister\r\nbeing William Houson, curate; and from scribblings on f. 50 and\r\nelsewhere it may be inferred that at a later date in the 16th century\r\nthe MS. was in the hands of a certain William Porter, who, to judge from\r\nthe nature of his entries, was perhaps a scrivener’s clerk. There is\r\nmore decisive evidence of ownership in the signature “Jo. Malbee” on the\r\nfirst page, written towards the end of the 16th century under the moral\r\ndistich:\r\n\r\n        “Viue diu, sed viue Deo; nam viuere mundo\r\n          Mors est. Hæc vera est viuere vita Deo.”\r\n\r\nThe same page also contains the initials J. M., probably meaning John\r\nMalbee, together with the old library mark, ix D. 72.\r\n\r\nBefore commenting upon the English translation something must be said of\r\nthe original “Épître d’Othéa” and the remarkable woman who was its\r\nauthor.[5] In no sense was Christine de Pisan French by birth. Her\r\nfather Thomas de Pisan, or de Boulogne, was, as she tells us,[6] a\r\nnative of Bologna, and he may reasonably be identified with Tommaso di\r\nBenvenuto di Pizzano, who was Professor of Astrology there between 1345\r\nand 1356.[7] Later he obtained the salaried office of State Councillor\r\nat Venice, where also he married, and where Christine, probably the\r\neldest of his three children and the only girl, was born in 1364.[8] It\r\nwas shortly after her birth that he was prevailed upon by the French\r\nking Charles V. to remove to Paris, and the fact that Louis the Great of\r\nHungary was equally anxious to attract him to Buda shows how widely the\r\nfame of his learning and science had spread.[9] For fifteen years he had\r\nno cause to regret his change of country, for Charles not only made him\r\nhis physician and astrologer with handsome emoluments, but treated him\r\naltogether with marked distinction. Christine, who with her mother\r\njoined him at the end of 1368, was thus brought up at the most brilliant\r\nand intellectual court of the time, and when, at the early age of\r\nfifteen, she was married to Étienne du Castel in 1379, her ties with it\r\nwere further strengthened by her husband’s appointment as secretary to\r\nthe king. This prosperity was rudely interrupted by the premature death\r\nof Charles V. on 16th September, 1380. In her own words, “Or fu la porte\r\nouverte de noz infortunes, adonc faillirent à mon dit père ses grans\r\npensions.”[10] Thomas de Pisan in fact was growing old and out of\r\nfashion; with the loss of his place at court and its prestige he soon\r\nfell into neglect, and when in a few years he died, his wife and two\r\nsons were left dependent upon his daughter and son-in-law. Happily the\r\nlatter still retained his post under the new king, and if he had lived\r\nall might have gone well, though possibly in that case Christine’s\r\nlatent powers would never have been called into activity. As a climax,\r\nhowever, to her misfortunes Étienne du Castel was carried off by an\r\nepidemic at Beauvais in 1389, and she thus found herself a widow at\r\ntwenty-five with three children besides others[11] to support out of\r\nwhat little she could rescue from the claimants to her husband’s estate.\r\n\r\nCurious details of the protracted lawsuits and other troubles by which\r\nshe was harassed during the next few years are given in several of her\r\nworks; but it is enough to say that her tenacity and force of character\r\ncarried her safely through until she made for herself a literary\r\nposition which for one of her sex was probably without precedent.\r\nExcepting a few short pieces anterior perhaps to her husband’s death,\r\nshe appears to have begun writing poetry as a solace in her widowhood.\r\nSuch pathetic effusions as “Seulete suy et seulete vueil estre” and “Je\r\nsuis vesve, seulete et noir vestue,”[12] with others in a similar\r\nstrain, could hardly fail to excite sympathy, and she was thus\r\nencouraged to utilize her pen for procuring more material support. At\r\nthe end of the 14th century all that an author struggling with poverty\r\nhad to depend upon was the patronage and munificence of the great, and\r\nit may therefore have been mainly to suit the taste of those to whom she\r\nlooked for favour and assistance that she composed the lighter and more\r\namatory of the “Ballades,” “Lais” and “Virelais,” “Rondeaux” and “Jeux à\r\nvendre,” which were the earliest, and not the least charming, of her\r\npoems. Besides Charles VI. and his queen, the Dukes of Berry, Burgundy,\r\nand Orleans, and other princes, nobles, and great ladies of the French\r\ncourt, it is interesting to find among her warmest patrons the English\r\nEarl of Salisbury,[13] who came on an embassy to Paris in December,\r\n1398. The theory that it was for him that she made the collection of her\r\n“Cent Ballades” rests on little, if any, foundation, but his friendly\r\nregard for her is shown by his having taken her elder son Jean du\r\nCastel, then thirteen, to England, in order to educate him with a boy of\r\nhis own of similar age. By her own account, as it appears,[14] this was\r\nat the time of the marriage of Isabella, daughter of Charles VI., to\r\nRichard II., which took place at Calais on 4th November, 1396, so that\r\nshe may have become acquainted with the earl during a previous visit to\r\nParis, or while he was in France with Richard, who crossed over for the\r\nmarriage as early as 27th September. If he had not met a tragic fate on\r\n7th January, 1400, in an abortive attempt in favour of his deposed\r\nsovereign, Christine herself might have followed her son. At the same\r\ntime Salisbury was not the only nor most influential admirer of her\r\ntalent on this side of the Channel. After his death the usurper Henry\r\nIV. himself took charge of the boy and tried to induce her to settle in\r\nEngland, and it is to her credit that loyalty to the earl’s memory among\r\nother reasons made her obdurate. In order, however, to get back her son\r\nshe feigned compliance until he was sent to fetch her, when she kept him\r\nwith her and remained in France.[15]\r\n\r\nBefore this she had entered on the second stage of her literary career,\r\nto which the “Épître d’Othéa” most probably belongs. In 1399 she\r\nresolved to attempt longer and more serious poems, animated by a more or\r\nless definite moral purpose, and she began by preparing herself for this\r\ntask by a strenuous course of study, as nearly encyclopædic in character\r\nas was then possible, though there is no reason to suppose that she was\r\nacquainted with Greek authors except through Latin translations. But her\r\nearliest poems of any length, issued between 1399 and 1402, were still\r\nof the nature of “Dits d’Amour.” Such, for example, were the “Épître au\r\ndieu d’amour” and the “Dit de la Rose,” the “Débat de deux amants,” the\r\n“Dit de Poissy,” with its lively account of her visit in 1400 to Poissy\r\nAbbey, where her daughter was a nun, and the idyllic “Dit de la\r\npastoure.”[16] The first two of these poems were written in defence of\r\nwomen against the aspersions of Jean de Meun in the “Roman de la Rose”\r\nand his school, and they involved her in a protracted controversy, in\r\nwhich with the valuable support of Jean Gerson she fully held her own.\r\nThe moralizing element is much more strongly developed in the “Chemin de\r\nlong estude,”[17] and the “Mutation de Fortune,”[18] which were composed\r\nin 1402 and 1403. In the earlier of these somewhat prolix, but withal\r\nextremely interesting, works Christine is conducted by the Sibyl\r\nAmalthea through the known world,[19] and then ascends with her as far\r\nas the fifth heaven. After recounting these experiences she proceeds to\r\ninculcate doctrines of right and justice by means of an elaborate\r\nallegory, in which Raison, Sagesse, Noblesse, Chevalerie, and Richesse\r\nplay the leading parts, room being also found for a glowing eulogy of\r\nCharles V. In the “Mutation de Fortune” she again indulges her taste for\r\nallegory, but in place of geography and astronomy other sciences have\r\ntheir turn. The introduction, which is rich in personal interest, deals\r\nwith her father’s life and her own and then leads up to her dream or\r\nvision of the great “Chastel de Fortune.” This castle is in fact the\r\nworld, and those who lodge in it are the various classes of mankind, who\r\nfrom pope and king downwards are vividly characterized; while the\r\nsubjects painted on the walls of the hall give occasion for summaries of\r\nphilosophy and of universal history to the birth of Christ, followed by\r\nallusions to more recent events and by another tribute to the virtues of\r\nThomas de Pisan’s royal patron. On 1st January, 1403–4, Christine\r\npresented this poem as a new-year’s gift to Philip, Duke of Burgundy,\r\nbrother of Charles V. The immediate result was a commission to write the\r\nlate king’s life, and although the duke himself died on 27th April\r\nfollowing, she completed this task within the year, sending a copy to\r\nhis elder brother John, Duke of Berry, on 1st January, 1404–5.\r\n\r\nThe “Livre des fais et bonnes meurs du sage roy Charles V.” is the best\r\nknown and in many respects the most valuable of all her writings,[20]\r\nand it also marks the beginning of the period when she practically\r\nabandoned verse in favour of prose. Though full of interesting details,\r\nthe work is not so much a regular biography as an appreciation of the\r\nking’s character from the point of view of an enthusiastic partisan. To\r\nsome extent Charles V. realized Christine’s ideal of chivalry, and in\r\nher discursive way she seized her chance to enforce by his example the\r\nparamount necessity to a ruler of a sound education and virtuous\r\nprinciples, with covert reflections no doubt upon the political\r\nrivalries and dissolute morals which under the unhappy circumstances of\r\nhis successor’s mental disease were bringing ruin upon France. Of her\r\nremaining works “La Vision,”[21] which appeared later in 1405, is of\r\npeculiar interest for its self-revelation. It was apparently meant as a\r\nreply to those who, on the ground of her sex and foreign origin,\r\nquestioned her right to pose as an authority on French history and\r\nmorals; but with a frank recital of her chequered fortunes and a defence\r\nof her position she mixes up a curious allegory on the mighty power of\r\n“Dame Opinion” and a discussion on the comfort to be derived from\r\nphilosophy. To quote a simile which she more than once applies to\r\nherself,[22] “petite clochete grant voix sonne”; and this may certainly\r\nbe said of two ambitious treatises written seemingly about 1407. One of\r\nthem is the well-known “Livre des faits d’armes et de chevalerie,”[23]\r\nwhich is nothing less than an attempt to teach the whole art of war,\r\ngrounded largely upon Vegetius and other authorities, but not without\r\nshrewd and pertinent observations of her own; while in the other,\r\nentitled “Le Corps de Policie,” she takes up the subject of civil\r\ngovernment, more particularly with regard to the education of princes\r\nand the duties and mutual relations of the several orders in the state.\r\nThe “Cité des Dames”[24] and its complement the “Livre des Trois\r\nVertus”[25] deal on the contrary with subjects which fell less\r\ndisputably within her natural sphere. As we have seen, she had already\r\nchampioned her sex in verse. In coming forward again in its defence, but\r\nthis time in prose, she went further, taking upon herself to lay down\r\nrules of guidance for women of all ranks, which she effectively did by\r\nallegory as well as by precepts and by historical examples.\r\n\r\nIn all these works her aims were moral rather than political. But\r\nalthough, considering her relations with the leaders of the contending\r\nfactions, it is not surprising that she abstained from decisively taking\r\na side, there is no doubt that she was profoundly moved by the growing\r\nmiseries of her adopted country. As early as 1405 she addressed to the\r\nqueen, Isabella of Bavaria, a letter[26] strongly advocating peace, and\r\nfive years later she returned to the subject in a passionate appeal[27]\r\nto the princes generally and the Duke of Berry in particular. The “Livre\r\nde la Paix,” the different parts of which were composed respectively in\r\n1412 and 1413 in connexion with the transient pacifications of Auxerre\r\nand of Pontoise, is of less restricted scope.[28] It was dedicated by\r\nChristine to the youthful Dauphin, Louis, Duke of Guienne, and after an\r\nearnest exhortation to harmony it is expanded into a formal treatise on\r\nthe virtues that go to form the perfect prince, Charles V. providing her\r\nas usual with an ever ready example. This appears to have been the\r\nlatest, as it is one of the most important, of her prose works; for\r\nalthough possibly some of her religious verses were composed in the\r\ninterval, so far as is known she maintained an unbroken silence until\r\n1429, when the triumphs of the Maid of Orleans drew from her a poem\r\nringing with patriotic fervour,[29] her joy at the approaching\r\ndeliverance of France being no doubt all the greater because its\r\npromised saviour was a woman. What her feelings were when these hopes\r\nwere again deferred can only be imagined, for nothing more is heard of\r\nher. In the opening lines of her poem she states that she had then been\r\neleven years in a convent,[30] but she omits to give its name, and the\r\ndate and the place of her death thus alike remain unidentified.\r\n\r\nOf all her works the one with which we are here specially concerned\r\npresents perhaps most difficulty with regard to date. In the best\r\ncopies, as in Harley MS. 4,431,[31] it is headed “Ci commence lepistre\r\nOthea la deesse, que elle envoya a Hector de Troie _quant il estoit en\r\nlaage de quinze ans_,” for which reason, coupled with its dedication to\r\nLouis, Duke of Orleans, it has been too hastily assigned to 1386,[32]\r\nwhen Louis himself was of that age. Against this date it is almost\r\nenough to urge that Christine was then only twenty-two years old, and\r\nfrom all that we know of her she was not in the least likely to have\r\nbegun authorship so early with a long didactic treatise mostly in prose;\r\nbut, apart from this, Louis was not made Duke of Orleans until 4th June,\r\n1391, so that the work could not have been addressed to him, as it is,\r\nunder that title five years before. Another theory, that, although\r\ndedicated to Louis, it was designed for the edification of his son and\r\nheir Charles[33] is not open to the same objections; for, as the future\r\npoet-duke was born in 1391, the date would then be 1406, at which time\r\nChristine was in full career as a moralist and prose-writer, with strong\r\nviews, as may be seen in her “Fais et bonnes meurs du sage roy Charles\r\nV.”, on the subject of chivalrous qualities. On the other hand, if the\r\nfacts were as supposed, in addressing the work to the father she would\r\nhardly have failed to make some explanatory reference to the son. Her\r\nomission to do so therefore makes this theory hardly less untenable than\r\nthe other. It is more likely that the date lies between these two\r\nextremes. The significance of the dedication may easily be overrated. It\r\nwas Christine’s habit to send her works with a separate dedicatory\r\npreface to her several patrons as new-year’s gifts for no other reason\r\nprobably than the hope of a tangible acknowledgment, and we know in fact\r\nthat other copies of the “Épître d’Othéa” were sent both to Charles VI.\r\nand the Duke of Berry.[34] If it is necessary to look for some\r\nparticular youth of fifteen to whom she wished to play the part of a\r\nmoral instructress, he may perhaps be found in her own son, for whom on\r\nanother occasion she wrote the “Enseignemens Moraux.”[35] Jean du Castel\r\nwas probably of the required age about 1400, so that in this case the\r\nwork represents, as it well may, the first-fruits of the studies in\r\nwhich she immersed herself shortly before, and its date moreover exactly\r\naccords with its position in her own collections of her works, where it\r\ncomes after the “Dit de Poissy” (1400) and before the “Chemin de long\r\nestude” (1402).[36]\r\n\r\nAlthough without any claim to be reckoned among the best of her works,\r\nit is at least admirable in motive. Ostensibly it is addressed by the\r\nGoddess of Prudence or Wisdom to her _protégé_ Hector with the object of\r\ninciting him to the attainment of true knighthood by the practice of\r\nvirtue, the name of the goddess being clearly no more than the Greek\r\nvocative ὦ θεά, commonly used in Homer in speeches addressed to\r\nAthena.[37] The plan of the work is somewhat peculiar. The epistle\r\nproper, which purports to be Othea’s own, is in verse, and is divided\r\ninto a hundred “textes,” each of which after the first five consists of\r\na single quatrain. These hundred “textes” serve as a medium for\r\ninstilling into the mind of the pupil as many moral precepts or rules of\r\nbehaviour, wrapped up in an allusion to some story from mythology, from\r\nthe history of Troy or, very rarely, from other sources, without the\r\nleast regard for chronological propriety. Othea indeed anticipates the\r\ncharge of anachronism by claiming at the outset (p. 6) the divine\r\nprerogative of prophecy, by which means she obviates the incongruity of\r\ndrawing lessons for Hector from the circumstances of his own death (p.\r\n105), from the story of Cyrus and Queen Tomyris (p. 63), and even from\r\nthe vision of Christ shown by the Sibyl to the Roman emperor Augustus\r\n(p. 113). Perhaps the most glaring anachronism is the reference to the\r\nfate of “Thune” (p. 110). It has been suggested in a note on the passage\r\nthat this is a corruption in the MSS. for “Thyre” or Tyre; but the rhyme\r\nboth in the French and English versions requires “Thune,” and possibly\r\nthe allusion is to the much vaunted expedition of Louis, Duke of\r\nBourbon, against Tunis in 1391. If so, this is a single instance of a\r\nreference to an event in more recent times. The “textes,” however, are\r\nnot left to stand alone, being invariably followed by a “glose” and an\r\n“allégorie,” both of which are in prose and often of some length. The\r\nbulk of the work therefore is really a commentary by Christine herself\r\nupon Othea’s supposed teaching. Thus, in the “glose” she amplifies and\r\nexplains the allusion in the “texte,” and as a rule points its\r\napplication by a maxim from an ancient philosopher; and, having done\r\nthis to her own satisfaction, she next dilates in the “allégorie” on its\r\nmore spiritual meaning, which she illustrates by a passage from one of\r\nthe Fathers or some later theologian, and finally by a more or less\r\nappropriate verse from Scripture. These last citations are from the\r\nLatin Vulgate, and from the fact that the translator omits them it may\r\nbe inferred that he was either ignorant of Latin or intended to supply\r\nthem from the Wycliffite English version. In this way Christine works\r\nthrough the Virtues and Vices, the Articles of the Creed, the Ten\r\nCommandments, the properties and influences of the seven planets, and so\r\nforth; and the whole forms a curious and ill-assorted medley, which is\r\nnot without interest as a reflection of the taste of the time, but which\r\ncontains, it must be confessed, little either to attract or to edify the\r\nmodern reader.\r\n\r\nNo critical edition of the original work has yet appeared, and the\r\npreface to a translation is hardly the place in which to enter minutely\r\ninto its composition. Apart, however, from the Latin Vulgate and the\r\ntheological writers whose names may be found in the index, there are\r\nthree sources from which the matter appears to be mainly derived.\r\nChristine’s classical mythology, it is clear, comes almost entirely from\r\nthe Metamorphoses of Ovid, but whether she had recourse to the original\r\nor to a moralized mediæval adaptation is a question not so easily\r\ndetermined. There is a work of the latter kind in French verse and of\r\nprodigious length, fourteen MSS. of which are known, including one in\r\nthe British Museum (Add. MS. 10,324). By some misunderstanding it was\r\nformerly attributed to Philippe de Vitry, Bishop of Meaux (1351–1362).\r\nModern criticism, however, has proved that it was really written by\r\nChrétien Legouais, a Friar Minor, for the queen of Philip IV., Jeanne de\r\nChampagne, who died in 1305.[38] There was a copy in the library of\r\nChristine’s patron, the Duke of Berry,[39] but it was apparently\r\nacquired in 1403, after the “Épître d’Othéa” was written. Although it is\r\nquite possible that she had a direct knowledge of this poem, she is more\r\nlikely to have used a moralized prose paraphrase of the Metamorphoses by\r\nthe Benedictine Pierre Bersuire, who in his second edition, written at\r\nParis in 1342, laid Legouais under contribution. Bersuire wrote in\r\nLatin, which language Christine certainly understood, and how soon his\r\nwork appeared in French it is difficult to say. In the Berry Library\r\nthere were three MSS. of the Metamorphoses apparently in vernacular\r\nprose,[40] any one, if not all, of which may have been Bersuire in a\r\nFrench version. There is also a French prose version in Brit. Mus. Royal\r\nMS. 17 E. iv. in company with the “Épître d’Othéa” itself, but the MS.\r\nis not earlier than the latter part of the 15th century. This version is\r\nclosely connected with that printed at Bruges in 1484 by Colard Mansion,\r\nwho supposed the original author to have been, not Bersuire, but Thomas\r\nWaleys or de Galles. The two are, however, not quite identical, and the\r\nformer possibly represents an older version, which Mansion revised for\r\nprinting. But whatever the particular form of Ovid’s Metamorphoses which\r\nChristine utilized, her naive interpretations of his mythological tales\r\nare no doubt largely her own. In this respect she was certainly not in\r\nadvance of her age. In the usual euhemeristic fashion she regarded the\r\nclassical deities and demigods as men and women who by the “prerogative\r\nof some grace” had raised themselves above their fellows and were for\r\nthis reason accorded divine honours; or, on the other hand, they were\r\nmere inventions of the poets, who, for instance, by inverting the\r\nprocess by which the planets were named from the gods, made gods of the\r\nplanets. A fair sample of her method may be seen in the story of Perseus\r\n(p. 15). This hero, whose name, by the way, our English translator\r\nchanged into that of the better known Arthurian Sir Perceval, was a\r\n“moult vaillant chevalier,” his steed Pegasus was “bonne renommée” or\r\nfame, which carried his name into all lands, and his deliverance of\r\nAndromeda teaches the aspirant to knighthood the duty of relieving all\r\nwomen in distress. So much may be learnt from the “glose”; but in the\r\n“allégorie” Pegasus becomes the spiritual knight’s good angel, “qui fera\r\nbon rapport de lui au jour de jugement,” while Andromeda is his soul,\r\nwhich he frees from the power of the fiend.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the many personages and incidents from Trojan history\r\nintroduced into the work, Christine’s authority was evidently a French\r\nprose romance which in a 15th century copy in the British Museum (Add.\r\nMS. 9,785) is entitled “La vraye ystoire de Troye.” Its origin has been\r\ntraced in an instructive article by M. Paul Meyer entitled “Les\r\npremières compilations françaises d’histoire ancienne.”[41] It appears\r\nto be founded upon the well-known romance of Troy in French verse by\r\nBenoît de Ste. More and to have been composed before 1287, and it was\r\nemployed, instead of Dares Phrygius as was previously the case, in the\r\nsecond edition of the compilation known as the “Histoire ancienne\r\njusqu’à César.” There is, however, no reason to doubt that what\r\nChristine worked from was the “Vraye histoire” itself.\r\n\r\nThe third authority of which she habitually made use was of a different\r\ncharacter, supplying her, not with mythological or legendary tales, but\r\nwith moral maxims, one of which, as we have already remarked, she\r\ngenerally quoted at the end of each “glose.” These maxims are derived\r\nfrom a singular work known as “Dicta Philosophorum,” and consisting of\r\nlong strings of apophthegms attached to the names of various ancient\r\nsages. They begin with Sedechias, of whom it is said “primus fuit per\r\nquem nutu Dei lex precepta fuit,” and besides Homer, Solon, Hippocrates,\r\nPythagoras, Diogenes, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Alexander of Macedon,\r\nand Ptolemy, they include Hermes Trismegistus and such strange and\r\nevidently corrupted names as Tac, Salquinus (or, as it is written in\r\nsome MSS., Zaqualquin), Rabion (or Sabion), Assaron, Longinon,\r\nMagdarges, Texillus (or Thesillus) and others, some of which have a\r\ndistinctly oriental appearance. The Arabic original in fact exists in a\r\nwork written by Abu-’l-Wafá Mobasschir ibn-Fátik al Káïd, an emir of\r\nEgypt, in 1053.[42] Sedechias appears there as Adam’s son Seth, and some\r\nother of the above names may be dimly recognized in Sab, ancestor of the\r\nSabæans, Lókman, Maháda Gis, and Basilius. From the heading of the Latin\r\nversion in the MS. from which it has been published,[43] it seems that\r\nthe work was first translated from Arabic into Greek, and then again\r\nfrom Greek into Latin, the last version being by John de Procida, famous\r\nfor the prominent part he took in the revolution which freed Sicily from\r\nCharles of Anjou and the French in 1282. Christine de Pisan, however,\r\napparently employed a popular French version made from the Latin for\r\nCharles VI. by one of his chamberlains, Guillaume de Tignonville, who\r\nwas afterwards Provost of Paris (1401–1408) and died in 1414. As a copy\r\nof it at Paris was written in 1402,[44] it was certainly completed\r\nbefore then, and the probability is that it preceded the “Épître\r\nd’Othéa” by several years. It possesses a special interest from the fact\r\nthat an English version of it had the honour of being the first book\r\nactually printed in this country. This was the famous _Dictes and\r\nSayengis of the Philosophres_, which Anthony Wydeville, second Earl\r\nRivers, translated from a copy of De Tignonville’s work lent to him when\r\nhe was going on a pilgrimage to Compostella in 1473, and which Caxton\r\nissued from his newly established press at Westminster in 1477.[45]\r\nNeither of them seems to have been aware that another English version\r\nwas in existence, which dated from 1450.[46] This is still preserved in\r\ntwo MSS. in the British Museum, but has never been printed. The late\r\n15th century copy in Add. MS. 34,193 (ff. 137–201) has the advantage of\r\nbeing complete, but it bears no evidence of origin, having neither title\r\nnor preface and ending merely with the words “Hic est finis libri\r\nmoralium philosophorum.” Harley MS. 2,266, on the contrary, though it is\r\nmutilated at the beginning and elsewhere, fortunately has the following\r\ncolophon:\r\n\r\n  “This boke byfore wretyn is callid in Frensh lettris Ditz de\r\n  Philisophius and in Englysh for to sey the doctryne and þe wysedom\r\n  of the wyse auncyent philysophers, as Arystotle, Plato, Socrates,\r\n  Tholome and suche oþer, translatid out of laten in to frensh to\r\n  (_sc._ for) kyng Charles the vi^{te} of Fraunse by Wyllyam\r\n  Tyngnovyle, knyght, late provest of the cyte of Parys, and syth now\r\n  late translatyd out of frensh tung in to englysh the yere of oure\r\n  Lord m^lccccl. to (_sc._ for) John Fostalf, knyght, for his\r\n  contemplacion and solas by Stevyn Scrope, squyer, sonne in law to\r\n  the seide Fostalle. Deo gracias.”\r\n\r\nThe truth of the statement here made may be accepted without hesitation,\r\nnor is its interest confined to the translation of the “Dis des\r\nPhilosophes” to which it is attached, for, as will be seen below, it\r\nalso materially helps to determine the similar origin of the English\r\nversion of Christine de Pisan’s “Épître d’Othéa,” which we now have to\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\nIf the rubricator had done his work, no doubt the “Epistle of Othea to\r\nHector” would have had this title prefixed in conformity with the MSS.\r\nof the French original. As it is, the text begins abruptly without a\r\nword of heading three lines from the bottom of the first page, and the\r\nonly preliminary indication of its nature is furnished by the\r\ninscription “The Booke of Knyghthode,” written, apparently by a somewhat\r\nlater hand, on the old vellum cover, which now serves for a fly-leaf.\r\nThis alternative title is peculiar to the English version, and is\r\nextracted from the translator’s dedicatory preface, to which source we\r\nare also indebted for a clue to his identity and the knowledge of the\r\ncircumstances under which the translation was made. The anonymous\r\npatron, “noble and worshipfull among the ordre of cheualrie,” to whom\r\nthe preface is addressed was obviously a person of some consequence. He\r\nwas of knightly rank and had won great renown in France and\r\nelsewhere[47] abroad, having spent most part of his life in “dedys of\r\ncheualrie and actis of armis.” He was now, however, sixty years of age,\r\nand was compelled by failing strength to seek retirement, and he is\r\nthereupon somewhat pointedly reminded that it behoved him to devote the\r\nremainder of his days to conflict with those spiritual enemies that war\r\nagainst the soul. If this were all, it might have applied to more than\r\none veteran of the protracted French war which began in 1415; but, when\r\nthe writer goes on to speak of himself (p. 2) as “I, yowre most humble\r\nson Stevyn,” there can hardly be a doubt that, as in the case of the\r\nabove-mentioned translation of the “Dis des Philosophes,” we have to do\r\nwith that famous old warrior Sir John Fastolf, K.G., and his stepson[48]\r\nStephen Scrope, esquire.\r\n\r\nThe briefest summary of Fastolf’s military career[49] will suffice to\r\nshow how closely it accords with the writer’s description. Son of a\r\nNorfolk squire and born in or about 1378, he appears to have begun\r\nactive service early in the reign of Henry IV. with that king’s second\r\nson, Thomas, afterwards Duke of Clarence. In 1401, though a mere lad of\r\nfourteen, Thomas of Lancaster, as he was then called, was appointed his\r\nfather’s Lieutenant in Ireland. Fastolf was in his train there in 1402,\r\nif not before, and on 14th April, 1406,[50] he had from him a grant of\r\nthe office of joint Chief Butler of Ireland during the minority of the\r\nEarl of Ormonde. He was still in Ireland when he married Millicent,\r\ndaughter of Robert, Lord Tiptoft, and widow of the Deputy Lieutenant,\r\nSir Stephen Scrope. The marriage took place on 13th January, 1409, only\r\nfour months after the death (4th September, 1408) of the lady’s first\r\nhusband,[51] whose son and heir Stephen was a minor ten or twelve years\r\nold at the time.[52] Besides other advantages, it gave Fastolf the\r\ncontrol over lands of his wife and stepson in Yorkshire, at Castle Combe\r\nin Wiltshire, and elsewhere, and he seems to have exercised it with\r\nlittle regard to any one’s interest except his own. His earliest service\r\nin France probably dated from 1412. He figures in the long muster-roll\r\nof esquires who joined the expedition under Clarence in August of that\r\nyear,[53] and before its close he had become Lieutenant of the castle of\r\nBordeaux.[54] With the accession of Henry V. his energy and undoubted\r\ntalent for war found ample scope. His contract in June, 1415,[55] to\r\nserve the king with ten men-at-arms and thirty archers was speedily\r\nfollowed by Henry’s invasion of France and the siege of Harfleur.\r\nEvidently it was not long before he attracted notice, for when the town\r\nsurrendered on 22nd September he was at once put in command of it under\r\nthe king’s uncle, Thomas Beaufort, Earl of Dorset.[56] This did not\r\nprevent him from displaying his prowess a month later at Agincourt; and\r\nhe was again active in the sieges of Caen and Rouen and in other\r\noperations during Henry’s second invasion of Normandy in 1417–1419.\r\nHardly any name in fact of secondary rank more frequently recurs in the\r\nchronicles and documents of the war for a quarter of a century. Already\r\nknighted before 29th January, 1415–6,[57] he was made a knight banneret\r\nin 1423 and a Knight of the Garter in 1426; and, only to mention a few\r\nof the posts conferred upon him,[58] in 1420 he was made Governor of the\r\nBastille of St. Antoine at Paris, in 1422 Master of the Household to\r\nJohn, Duke of Bedford, Regent of France, and in 1423 Lieutenant of\r\nNormandy and Governor of Anjou and Maine. In the minor battles and\r\nsieges which made up so much of the desultory warfare of the time he was\r\neverywhere conspicuous. On 2nd March, 1423, with the Earl of Salisbury,\r\nhe recovered Meulan; on 17th August, 1424, he shared in the victory at\r\nVerneuil and took the Duke of Alençon prisoner; on 11th October in the\r\nsame year he captured Sillé le Guillaume, from which he acquired the\r\ntitle of baron; on 2nd August, 1425, again with Salisbury, he received\r\nthe surrender of Le Mans[59]; and on 12th February, 1429, when in\r\ncommand of a convoy of much needed supplies for the English camp before\r\nOrleans, he signally defeated a far stronger force of French and Scots\r\nat Rouvray St. Denis in the famous “Battle of the Herrings.” Up to this\r\npoint, so far as is known, he had met with almost uninterrupted success;\r\nbut after the advent of Jeanne Darc had caused the raising of the siege\r\nof Orleans, when the English were routed and Lord Talbot was taken\r\nprisoner at Pataye on 18th June following, he barely succeeded in\r\nescaping from the field. Unfortunately for his fame with posterity, the\r\ncharge of cowardice on this occasion made against him in Monstrelet’s\r\nChronicle was repeated by Hall and Holinshed and has been perpetuated in\r\nthe “First Part of Henry VI.”[60] The effect of the charge at the time\r\nwas, however, transient at most, and there is no need to dwell upon it\r\nhere, either on its own account or in its bearing upon the question\r\nwhether he was the original of Shakespeare’s Sir John Falstaff. It is\r\ncontradicted by the chronicler Wavrin, who fought in the battle under\r\nhim, and it is out of keeping with his whole career; moreover, Talbot,\r\nwho was his bitterest accuser, was already on ill terms with him and,\r\nhaving flouted his advice just before the battle, in his chagrin at\r\ndefeat was perhaps only too ready to make him a scapegoat. The Regent\r\nBedford’s action in the matter is significant; for, although Fastolf was\r\nat first badly received by him, after a formal inquiry he was again\r\ntaken into favour and the Garter, of which he is said to have been\r\ndeprived, was restored to him in spite of Talbot’s protests. Nor was\r\nless use made of his services afterwards. Thus, between 1430 and 1434 we\r\nfind him Lieutenant of Caen and of Alençon and Captain of Fresnay, and\r\nin 1431 he relieved Vaudemont and captured the Duke of Bar. As late as\r\n1435 he is spoken of as Governor of Anjou and Maine,[61] and until the\r\nDuke of Bedford’s death on 14th September of that year he continued at\r\nthe head of his household, being so described both in a list of the\r\nRegent’s retinue in 1435 and in a highly interesting report on the\r\nconduct of the war which he himself drew up about the same time.[62]\r\nBedford’s confidence in him to the last is also clear from the fact that\r\nhe named him one of the executors of his will. Notwithstanding the loss\r\nof so powerful a patron and his own advancing years, Fastolf was plainly\r\nin no hurry to put off his armour; for, with the exception of occasional\r\nvisits to England as before, he remained abroad for at least five years\r\nlonger. His retirement is generally fixed in 1440, but there is evidence\r\nof his being in Maine in the following year.[63] On 12th May, 1441, the\r\nDuke of York, Bedford’s successor as Regent, granted him a yearly\r\npension of £20 for his services,[64] and probably therefore it was not\r\nvery long before or after that date that he finally turned his back upon\r\nthe country from whose unhappy distractions he had won fame and fortune.\r\n\r\nIt is at this stage of his life that we get a glimpse of him in the\r\ndedication of the “Epistle of Othea.” From its language this was written\r\nsoon after he finally returned home; in fact it gives his age, no doubt\r\nsomewhat loosely, as sixty, whereas even in 1440 he was probably\r\nsixty-two. During the greater part of the period which elapsed before\r\nhis death on 5th November, 1459, he seems to have resided chiefly in\r\nSouthwark, where he was within easy reach of a summons to the King’s\r\nCouncil, of which he was a member; and there is something attractive in\r\nthe picture which Stephen Scrope’s words suggest of the war-worn old\r\nsoldier beguiling his leisure with literary studies. Nor are the\r\n“Epistle of Othea” and the “Sayings of the Philosophers” the only two\r\ntranslations made at his “commaundement” and for his “contemplacion and\r\nsolas.” In 1481 Caxton printed an English version, rendered from the\r\nFrench of Laurence de Premierfait, of Cicero’s “De Senectute.”[65] On\r\nthe question of its authorship I shall have some remarks to make further\r\non; but meanwhile it deserves notice that its preface states that it\r\n“was translated and thystoryes openly declared by the ordenaunce and\r\ndesyre of the noble auncyent knyght Syr Johan Fastolf of the countee of\r\nNorfolk banerette, lyuyng the age of four score yere, excercisyng the\r\nwarrys in the Royame of Fraunce and other countrees, ffor the diffence\r\nand vnyuersal welfare of bothe royames of englond and ffraunce by fourty\r\nyeres enduryng, the fayte of armes hauntyng, and in admynystryng justice\r\nand polytique gouernaunce vnder thre kynges, that is to wete Henry the\r\nfourth, Henry the fyfthe, Henry the syxthe, and was gouernour of the\r\nduchye of Angeou and the countee of Mayne, Capytayn of many townys,\r\nCastellys and fortressys in the said Royame of ffraunce, hauyng the\r\ncharge and saufgarde of them dyuerse yeres, ocupyeng and rewlynge thre\r\nhonderd speres and the bowes acustomed thenne, and yeldyng good acompt\r\nof the forsaid townes castellys and fortresses to the seyd kynges and of\r\ntheyr lyeutenauntes, Prynces of noble recomendacion, as Johan regent of\r\nffraunce Duc of Bedforde, Thomas duc of excestre, Thomas duc of clarence\r\n& other lyeutenauntes,” etc.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, there was another side to Fastolf’s character, which\r\nis revealed in that mine of curious information on the social life and\r\nmanners of the time, the well-known _Paston Letters_. Through his\r\nintimacy with John Paston,[66] who was ultimately his executor and\r\nprincipal heir, many of his private letters and papers are there\r\npreserved, and they certainly do not exhibit him in a favourable\r\nlight.[67] Hot-tempered, arbitrary and rapacious, harsh and mean to his\r\ndependents, an exacting creditor and a rancorous litigant, he was the\r\nreverse of Chaucer’s type of the “verray perfight, gentil knight.”\r\nWealthy as he was and childless, he was still bent on making gain,\r\npartly no doubt to pay for the building of his great castle at Caister\r\nin Norfolk, the ruins of which may still be seen. No one perhaps knew\r\nhim better or had suffered more from his hard dealing than his stepson.\r\nSome years later than the present work Stephen Scrope drew up a formal\r\nstatement of his wrongs,[68] in which he not only complained that in the\r\ndisposal of his wardship Fastolf had bought and sold him “as a beast,”\r\nbut even charged him with being the cause of illnesses which had marked\r\nhim for life[69] and with having at a later period used him so scurvily\r\nthat he was compelled to sell his manor of Hever in Kent and take\r\nservice with the Duke of Gloucester. Apparently this sign of\r\nindependence did not meet Fastolf’s views, for he soon managed to get\r\nhim into his own retinue, and, as the other admits, at this time he\r\nshowed him “good fatherhood,” employing him at Honfleur and elsewhere,\r\nprobably in a civil capacity,[70] until he returned home in pique at\r\nsome slight. Fastolf’s dealings with regard to Scrope’s inheritance are\r\nsomewhat obscure, but by some arrangement he contrived to secure Castle\r\nCombe for life.[71] As Lady Fastolf died in 1446, her son by her first\r\nmarriage, to whom it should have then come by right, was thus kept out\r\nof it for thirteen years longer, only enjoying it from his stepfather’s\r\ndeath in 1459 until his own in 1472. But in spite of differences the two\r\nwere apparently not altogether on bad terms; otherwise neither this\r\ntranslation nor that of the “Dis des Philosophes” would have been made,\r\nand still less would Scrope have spoken of Fastolf as he here does. His\r\nlanguage indeed is something more than respectful and laudatory. While\r\nhe fully endorses Wavrin’s description of Sir John as “moult sage et\r\nvaillant chevallier,”[72] there is a tone of humility which makes it\r\ndifficult to realize that the writer was upwards of forty years of age\r\nand at least Fastolf’s equal by birth. The nature of their relations may\r\nbe gathered from a singular letter to the latter about 1455 from Sir\r\nRichard Bingham, Justice of the King’s Bench, whose daughter Stephen\r\nScrope had recently married.[73] In imploring help for him the writer\r\nsays[74]:\r\n\r\n  “... My saide son is and hath be, and will be to hys lifes ende,\r\n  your true lad and servaunt, and glad and well willed to do that\r\n  myght be to your pleaser, wirschip and profit, and als loth to\r\n  offend yow as any person in erth, gentill and well disposid to every\r\n  person. Wherfore I besech your gode grace that ye will vouchesafe\r\n  remember the premissez, my saide sons age, his wirschipfull birth,\r\n  and grete misere for verrey povert, for he hath had no liflode to\r\n  life opon sithen my lady his moder deed, safe x. marc of liflode\r\n  that ye vouched safe to gife hym this last yer, and therffore to be\r\n  his good maister and fader. And thof he be not worthy to be your\r\n  son, make hym your almesman, that he may now in his age life of your\r\n  almesse, and be your bedeman, and pray for the prosperite of your\r\n  noble person....”\r\n\r\nThe result of this appeal, and of more to the same effect, is not\r\nrecorded, but that Fastolf could be gracious enough in words is evident\r\nfrom the only letter from him to Scrope which is included in the _Paston\r\nLetters_,[75] written on 30th October, 1457. It is addressed,\r\n“Worschepeful and my right wel beloved sone,” and, after thanking him\r\nfor his “good avertismentys and right well avysed lettres,” begs him to\r\nrecommend to his father-in-law, Justice Bingham, a suit in which the\r\nwriter was interested, and the tone throughout is unexceptionable. There\r\nis, however, another letter in the _History of Castle Combe_ (p. 270),\r\nwritten from Calais, and, according to the editor, about 1420, which is\r\nnot so amiable. After Scrope’s second marriage he and his stepfather no\r\ndoubt lived apart, but at the time when the “Epistle of Othea” was\r\ntranslated they were probably under the same roof, and as late as 1454,\r\nwhen Caister Castle was completed and Fastolf was about to take up his\r\nresidence there, it is expressly stated that Scrope would live with\r\nhim.[76]\r\n\r\nWhile there is little doubt that he was incapacitated by weak health\r\nfrom military service and that he was deficient also in force of\r\ncharacter, it cannot be said that, so far as we can judge from his two\r\ntranslations from the French, he possessed much literary ability. There\r\nis nothing original in either of them except the short preface to the\r\n“Epistle of Othea” here printed, and, interesting as this is in other\r\nrespects, its style is so involved that in places it is hardly\r\nintelligible. Nor is the writer more fortunate in his account of the\r\nFrench work which he translated; for by some strange misunderstanding he\r\ndeprives its authoress of the credit of it and makes out (p. 3) that it\r\nwas compiled by doctors of the University of Paris merely at the\r\ninstance and prayer of the “fulle wyse gentylwoman of Frawnce called\r\nDame Cristine.” It is curious that a very similar statement is made as\r\nto her works generally in a marginal note in the “Boke of Noblesse,”[77]\r\nwith reference to a passage taken from her “Livre des faits d’armes,”\r\nwhich, however, is wrongly spoken of as the “Arbre des batailles.” It is\r\nthere said that Christine was a lady of high birth and character, who\r\ndwelt in a house of religious ladies at Passy (Poissy?) near Paris, that\r\nshe maintained with exhibitions several clerks studying in the\r\nUniversity of Paris and caused them to compile divers virtuous books,\r\nsuch as the “Arbre des batailles,” and that the doctors in consequence\r\nattributed the books to Christine herself. As this note is in the hand\r\nof the well-known William Worcester or Botoner, who was servant and\r\nsecretary to Fastolf, the two statements no doubt had a common origin,\r\ncoming perhaps from Sir John himself.\r\n\r\nFrom the prominent way in which Scrope mentions the Duke of Berry it is\r\nreasonable to conclude that the French MS. which supplied him with the\r\noriginal text contained a dedicatory address by the authoress to that\r\nfamous royal bibliophil, who, as we know, was one of her special\r\npatrons. In the inventory of his library, among the MSS. acquired soon\r\nafter 1401, there is in fact the entry,[78] “Item le livre de l’espitre\r\nque Othéa la deesse envoia à Ethor (_sc._ Hector), compilé par\r\ndamoiselle Christine de Pizan, escript en françois de lettre de court,\r\ntrès bien historié .... le quel livre la dicte Cristine a donné à mon\r\ndit seigneur”; and the probability is that on Fastolf’s return to\r\nEngland he brought with him either this identical MS. or a transcript of\r\nit, together with a copy of De Tignonville’s “Dis des philosophes.”\r\nExisting copies of the “Épître d’Othéa” are not uncommon. In the\r\nBibliothèque Nationale at Paris there are twelve,[79] and Koch (p. 59)\r\nmentions six others at Brussels, while the British Museum possesses\r\nfour. One of these is included in the fine collection of Christine’s\r\npoems and other works in Harley MS. 4,431. It is the MS. “H,” readings\r\nfrom which are given here in the notes, and the collotype frontispiece,\r\nwhich depicts the goddess Othea personally handing her letter to Hector,\r\nis reproduced from the second of its numerous miniatures, one of which\r\nprecedes each of the hundred “textes.” The collection, which is of the\r\nhighest importance, including pieces found nowhere else,[80] was made by\r\nChristine herself, apparently about 1410–1415, for the French queen,\r\nIsabella of Bavaria, the MS. beginning with an introductory poem of\r\nninety-six lines addressed to her.[81] Probably it came into the\r\npossession of John, Duke of Bedford, Regent of France, in 1425[82] among\r\nother MSS. from the royal library of the Louvre; for the signature\r\n“Jaquete” of his second wife, Jacquetta of Luxemburg, is written on the\r\nfly-leaf, together with that of Anthony Wydeville, Earl Rivers, her son\r\nby her second marriage, in 1437, with Sir Richard Wydeville, who was\r\ncreated Earl Rivers in 1466. As we have already seen, Anthony, Earl\r\nRivers, translated the “Dis des philosophes,” and he also made an\r\nEnglish version, printed by Caxton in 1478, of Christine’s “Proverbes\r\nmoraux,” the text of which he no doubt obtained from this MS. After he\r\nperished on the scaffold in 1488, the volume passed by some means to\r\nLouis de Bruges, Sieur de Gruythuyse, created Earl of Winchester in\r\n1472, whose motto and name, “Plus est en vous. Gruthuse,” appear on the\r\nsame page. In 1676 it belonged to Henry Cavendish, Duke of Newcastle,\r\nand no doubt it found its way into the Harley collection by the marriage\r\nof his grand-daughter Lady Henrietta Cavendish-Holles in 1713 to Edward\r\nHarley, Lord Harley, second Earl of Oxford in 1724. That it was known to\r\nFastolf, when Master of the Household to the Regent Bedford, is likely\r\nenough; but the copy of the “Épître d’Othéa” included in it can hardly\r\nhave been the one used by Scrope, as it is dedicated, not to the Duke of\r\nBerry, but to his nephew Louis, Duke of Orleans. After some lines of\r\napostrophe to the “Fleur de lis” and to “Seigneurie,” which begin,\r\n\r\n        “Tres haulte flour, par le monde louee,\r\n        A tous plaisant et de dieu auouee,”\r\n\r\nit proceeds,\r\n\r\n        “Et a vous tres noble prince excellant,\r\n        Dorliens duc loys, de grant renom,\r\n        Filz de Charles Roy quint de cellui nom,\r\n        Qui fors le roy ne congnoiscez greigneur,\r\n        Mon tres loue et redoubte seigneur,\r\n        Dumble vouloir moy, poure creature,\r\n        Femme ignorant, de petite estature,\r\n        Fille iadis philosophe et docteur,\r\n        Qui conseiller et humble seruiteur\r\n        Vostre pere fu, que dieu face grace,\r\n        Et iadis vint de Boulongne la grace,\r\n        Dont il fu ne, par le sien mandement,\r\n        Maistre Thomas de pizan, autrement\r\n        De Boulonge, fu dit et surnomme,\r\n        Qui sollempnel clerc estoit renomme.”\r\n\r\n               *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis is the dedication which appears, not only in some other MSS. but in\r\nthe edition printed by Philippe Pigouchet at Paris, probably in 1490,\r\nunder the title _Les cent histoires de troye_.[83] Of the other three\r\nmanuscript copies in the British Museum, Royal MS. 14 E. ii. (f. 294)\r\nand 17 E. iv. (f. 272) have no dedication at all, while that in Harley\r\nMS. 219 (f. 106) appeals to a third patron:\r\n\r\n        “Prince excellent de haute renommee,\r\n        De qui grand vois par le mond est semee,\r\n        Tres noble en fais, sage, duit et apris\r\n        De touz les biens qui en bon sont compris,\r\n        Roy noble et haut chiualer conquerour,\r\n        Digne destre par vaillaunce Emperour,\r\n        A vous puissant, tres redoute seignour,\r\n        Qui dessur vous ne cognoise greignour,\r\n        Soit tres humble recommendacioun\r\n        Deuant mise de vray entencioun\r\n        De par moy que en sagesse non digne\r\n        Femme ignorant suy nommee Cristine,\r\n        Fille iadis philosophe et docteur,\r\n        Qui conseiller fu, humble seruiteur\r\n        Au Roy Charles quint, qui dieu face grace.”\r\n\r\n               *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe king who is thus addressed can be no other than the unfortunate\r\nCharles VI., although any hopes that he once excited had by this time\r\nbeen dispelled by his strange intermittent fits of insanity, which dated\r\nfrom 1392. Very similar terms were employed in the dedication to him by\r\nname of the “Chemin de long estude” in 1402:\r\n\r\n        “A vous, bon roy de France redoubtable,\r\n        Le VI^e Charles du nom notable,\r\n        Que Dieux maintienge en joie et en sante,\r\n        Mon petit dit soit premier presente,\r\n        Tout ne soit il digne qu’en telz mains aille,\r\n        Mais bon vouloir comme bon fait me vaille.”\r\n\r\nIn this instance, however, Christine associated with him his uncles\r\nBerry and Burgundy and his brother Orleans, who during his incapacity\r\ndivided the real power between them:\r\n\r\n        “Et puis a vous, haulz ducs magnifiez,\r\n        Dicelle fleur fais et ediffiez,\r\n        Dont l’esplendeur s’espant par toute terre,\r\n        Par quel honneur fait los a France a querre.”\r\n\r\nIn her presentation copies she was not wont to measure her language, and\r\nprobably Scrope’s extravagant eulogy of the Duke of Berry was based upon\r\nwhat he found in his MS., although, instead of translating the\r\ndedication as it stood, he chose to embody it in his preface. On the\r\nother hand, Christine of course was in no way responsible for the\r\nstatement that the duke lived for a hundred years (p. 3). How it\r\noriginated is a mystery, for there is no doubt whatever that he died on\r\n15th June, 1416, at the age of seventy-six.[84] Jean Bouchet indeed in\r\nhis _Annales d’Aquitaine_,[85] although he records the date of his death\r\ncorrectly, states that he was ninety or thereabouts, but he gives no\r\nauthority, and it is enough to say that Berry’s father King John II. was\r\nborn in 1319, and his eldest brother Charles V. in 1337. It will be seen\r\nthat Scrope represents him as a perfect paragon of chivalrous qualities,\r\nunrivalled in his time both in war and in council, as well as for deeds\r\nof piety. In more sober history, however, he by no means appears to such\r\nadvantage. His cultured and sumptuous tastes, his splendid buildings and\r\nhis library and other rich collections, have shed a certain lustre on\r\nhis name; but, as he showed especially in his government of Languedoc,\r\nhe was cruel, rapacious, and unprincipled, and in critical times his\r\nlife was that of a selfish and prodigal voluptuary. For war he had\r\nneither talent nor zest; his real element appears to have been\r\ndiplomacy, and, apart from his patronage of art and letters and his\r\nbenefactions to the church, his chief claim to credit rests on his\r\nrepeated attempts to mediate between the Burgundian and Orleanist\r\nfactions. Scrope’s estimate of him is in striking contrast with that of\r\nmodern historians, such as Raynal[86] and Martin, the latter of whom in\r\nrecording his death writes, “Ce prince laissa une mémoire souillée entre\r\ntoutes dans cette êpoque de souillures. Il joignait à bien d’autres\r\nvices le vice que la France pardonne le moins à ses chefs, le péché\r\nirremissible, la lâcheté.”[87]\r\n\r\nTo pass from the preface to the “Epistle of Othea” itself, there is no\r\nreason to suppose that the translator had received the training of a\r\nscholar; on the contrary, the probability is that, owing to a sickly\r\nyouth and other drawbacks, his education had been more or less\r\nneglected. It is not even certain that he had been regularly taught\r\nFrench. From a curious passage interpolated by Trevisa in his\r\ntranslation of Higden’s “Polychronicon,” which was finished in 1387, it\r\nseems that the fashion was then already dying out among the class to\r\nwhich by birth he belonged,[88] and possibly therefore he learnt all he\r\nknew of the language while he was with his stepfather in France. Be that\r\nas it may, his rendering of Christine de Pisan’s French may claim on the\r\nwhole to be fairly well done. The verse of his “textes” is too much of\r\nthe doggrel type and his meaning is sometimes obscure, but as a rule he\r\nfollows the original closely, while the orthography of the MS., though\r\natrociously bad, is no worse than what we are accustomed to in the\r\n_Paston Letters_ and elsewhere at the same period. Occasionally, as is\r\nonly natural, he goes astray, though it is of course possible that the\r\nfault lay with the MS. from which he translated. In most cases the\r\nsource of his errors is obvious. Thus he translates “ton bon cuer” (p.\r\n5) by “all good hertys,” having evidently mistaken “ton” for “tou[t]”;\r\nand again “en quant fraisle vaissel est sa vie contenue” (p. 28) by “in\r\nhow frele (_sc._ frail) a vessel his lyff is all naked” (toute nue)!\r\nSimilarly “conscience pour soy” (p. 16) appears as “conscience for\r\nfeyth” (foy); “ala querre les autres dieux” (p. 62) as “thanne went he\r\nforth [to seek] the tothir ii^o” (deux); “mais a nostre propos [la\r\nfable] veult dire” (_ibid._) as “Mars to owre purpose seith”; and “gard\r\ntoy de lagait (l’agait) de tes ennemis” (p. 73) as “kepe the (_sc._\r\nthee) from the peple (la gent) of thyn ennemyes.” It is not so easy to\r\nunderstand the process by which the simple sentence “Vanite fist lange\r\ndevenir deable” (p. 15) was transformed into “Vanite made avoyde degre\r\nto becum a fende,” whatever that may mean; or why in the story of Acis\r\nand Galatea (p. 65) “un iouuencel qui Acis estoit nommez” became “and he\r\nwas dede” (_sc._ dead), though possibly in this case there was some\r\nconfusion between “acis” and “occis.” But the strangest mistranslation\r\nis in the words “Averyse and covetise be ii^o sausmakers the which\r\nsesseth neuer to seye, ‘Bryng, Bryng’” (p. 105), where the French text\r\nhas “sont ii. sancsues,” sanguisugæ, or leeches. The reference of course\r\nis to Proverbs xxx. 15, “The horseleach hath two daughters, crying,\r\n‘Give, give’”; and, as stated in the note, “horseleeches” is in fact the\r\nrendering given in another translation of Christine’s work. Scrope’s\r\n“sausmakers” can hardly be anything but “sauce-makers,”[89] but it is\r\nnot impossible that he coined the mongrel word “sanc-suckers,” which the\r\nscribe miscopied.\r\n\r\nThe second English translation of the “Épître d’Othéa” referred to above\r\ncan be so little known that a brief account of it will not be\r\nsuperfluous. It exists only in the form of a small printed octavo in\r\nblack-letter with the title _Here foloweth the C. Hystoryes of Troye_,\r\nand there is no doubt that it was taken from Pigouchet’s French edition\r\nof 1490,[90] or one of the reprints; in fact it copies the second title\r\nin French, merely omitting the imprint “à Paris.” Many of its rough\r\nwoodcuts, one of which accompanies each “texte,” also come from the same\r\nsource, being generally reversed, but others are independent and their\r\nsubjects often have no connexion whatever with the text. In place of the\r\ndedication to the Duke of Orleans the translator gives a prologue of his\r\nown in ten seven-line stanzas, the first two of which are as follows:\r\n\r\n        “Boke, of thy rudenesse by consyderacion\r\n        Plunged in the walowes of abasshement,\r\n        For thy translatoure make excusacion\r\n        To all to whom thou shalt thy selfe present,\r\n        Besechynge them vpon the sentement\r\n        In the composed to set theyr regarde\r\n        And not on the speche cancred and frowarde.\r\n\r\n        “Shewe them that thy translatour hath the wryten,\r\n        Not to obtain thankes or remuneracions,\r\n        But to the entent to do the to be wryten\r\n        As well in Englande as in other nacyons.\r\n        And where mysordre in thy translation is,\r\n        Vnto the perceyuer with humble obeysaunce\r\n        Excuse thy reducer, blamyng his ygnoraunce.”\r\n\r\nAll the information which he gives about himself in this prologue is\r\nthat, when he made his translation, he was “flowring in youth,” but\r\nafter the “Finis” he has added, “Thus endeth the .C. Hystories of Troye,\r\ntranslated out of Frenche in to Englysshe by me. R.W.” This again is\r\nfollowed by the colophon, “Imprynted by me Robert Wyer, dwellyng in S.\r\nMartyns parysshe at Charyng Crosse at the sygne of S. John̄ Euangelist\r\nbesyde the Duke of Suffolkes place”; and it is therefore highly probable\r\nthat R. W. and Robert Wyer were identical, though the latter is not\r\notherwise known except as a printer. A list of nearly a hundred books\r\nissued by him has been made up,[91] ranging in date from 1530 to 1556,\r\nand all those which, as in this instance, have the Duke of Suffolk’s\r\nname in the imprint must have been published after 1536, when the\r\nproperty referred to, which previously belonged to the Bishop of\r\nNorwich, passed into his possession. The date of the book therefore is\r\nabout 1540–1550, though the translation may have been made some years\r\nbefore. For the sake of comparison with the earlier version of Stephen\r\nScrope, one of the texts with its commentary is here given:\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE .XXVIII. TEXTE.\r\n\r\n        Loue and prayse Cadmus so excellente,\r\n        And his dyscyples holde thou in chyerte.\r\n        He gaygned the fountayne of the Serpente\r\n        With ryght great payne afore that it wolde be.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE .XXVIII. GLOSE.\r\n\r\n  Cadmus was a moche noble man and founded Thebes, whiche cytie was\r\n  greatly renomed. He set there a study & he hym selfe was moche\r\n  profoundly lettered and of great science. And therfore sayth the\r\n  fable that he daunted the serpent at the fountayne, that is to\r\n  vnderstande the science and sages that alwayes springeth; the\r\n  Serpent is noted for the payne and trauayle which it behoueth the\r\n  student to daunte afore that he maye purchase scyence. And the fable\r\n  sayth that he hym self became a serpent, which is to vnderstande he\r\n  was a corrector and mayster of other. So wol Othea say that the good\r\n  knight ought to loue and honour the clerkes lettered, which ben\r\n  grounded in science. To this purpose sayeth Arystotle to Alexandre,\r\n  “Honour thou scyence and fortyfie it by good maysters.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE .XXVIII. ALLEGORIE.\r\n\r\n  Cadmus whiche daunted the Serpent at the fountayne, whiche the good\r\n  knyght ought to loue, we may vnderstande the blyssed humanite of\r\n  Jesu christ, which dompted the serpent and gaigned the fountayne,\r\n  that is to say the lyfe of this world, from the which he passed\r\n  afore with great payne and with great trauayle. Wherof he had\r\n  perfyte victory whan he rose agayne the thyrd day, as sayth S.\r\n  Thomas, “Tertia die resurrexit a mortuis.”\r\n\r\nIn conclusion it only remains to say a few words on the possible\r\nconnexion of Stephen Scrope with two other works already mentioned,\r\nwhich, like his “Epistle of Othea” or “Boke of Knyghthode” and his\r\n“Sayings of the Philosophers,” were written for Sir John Fastolf or\r\nunder his influence. One of them, the “Boke of Noblesse,” is preserved\r\nin a unique copy in the British Museum, Royal MS. 18 B. xxii., and was\r\nedited for the Roxburghe Club in 1860 by Mr. J. Gough Nichols. In the\r\nform in which it has come down to us, it was addressed to Edward IV. at\r\nthe time of his invasion of France in 1475, professing to be “write and\r\nentitled to courage and comfort noble men in armes to be in perpetuite\r\nof remembraunce for here noble dedis, as right conuenient is soo to\r\nbee,” or, more precisely, for the purpose of inciting the English to\r\nrecover by force of arms their lost foreign conquests. The contents were\r\nadmirably summarized in the editor’s introduction, and all that need be\r\nsaid of them here is that, in addition to a highly interesting\r\nretrospect of English relations with France, they include a large amount\r\nof matter derived from a French treatise on the art of war, which is\r\nspoken of as the “Arbre de Batailles” and attributed to “Dame Cristyn.”\r\nAlthough the editor failed to identify the author, he pointed out that\r\nhe must have been intimately associated with Fastolf and had access to\r\nhis papers. Strictly speaking, Fastolf’s name is not specially prominent\r\nexcept in the marginal insertions and notes, where the writer refers to\r\nhim as “myne autor” and gives several curious anecdotes as heard from\r\nhis lips. The body of the MS. is clearly not autograph; but these\r\nadditions, together with the title and colophon,[92] are in a different\r\nhandwriting, and, although the editor seems to have been unaware of the\r\nfact, it is beyond question that of William Worcester, or Botoner, who\r\nwas not only Fastolf’s servant and secretary, but is also known as an\r\nannalist and a diligent collector of matter on historical, topographical\r\nand other subjects.[93] The editor therefore dismissed his claims to the\r\nauthorship of the work rather too hastily, for, as the final touches\r\nwere certainly his, the only question is whether he was also responsible\r\nfor the whole of it from its inception. From the limit of date of the\r\nevents mentioned there is some reason to believe that it was originally\r\ncomposed within Fastolf’s lifetime and was only revised and enlarged in\r\n1475 for a special occasion; and its date may perhaps be fixed still\r\nmore exactly, since there is an allusion (p. 42) to “another gret armee\r\nand voiage fordone for defaut and lak of spedy payment _this yere_ of\r\nCrist M^lccccli.” Apart from the final additions there is evidence to\r\nconnect Worcester with it in a passage of the prologue to a series of\r\ndocuments relating to the wars in France which were collected by\r\nhim,[94] mainly no doubt from materials that belonged to Fastolf, and\r\nwhich may be regarded as _pièces justificatives_ to the “Boke of\r\nNoblesse.” This collection also appears to have been designed for Edward\r\nIV., but the original prologue was awkwardly recast, as we now have it,\r\nafter Worcester’s death by his son for dedication to Richard III. The\r\npassage in it referred to, for which he is responsible, is as follows:\r\n\r\n  “And I, as moost symple of reasone, youre righte humble legemane,\r\n  cannot atteyne to understond the reasons and bokes that many wise\r\n  philosophurs of gret auctorite have writtene upone this vertue of\r\n  Force, but that my pore fadyr, William Worcestre ... toke upone hym\r\n  to write in this mater and compiled this boke to the most highe and\r\n  gretly redoubted kyng, your most nobille brodyr and predecessoure,\r\n  shewyng after his symple connyng, after the seyng of the masters of\r\n  philosophie, as Renatus Vegesius in his Boke of Batayles, also\r\n  Julius Frontinus in his Boke of Knyghtly Laboures, callid in Greke\r\n  Stratagematon, a new auctoure callid The Tree of Batayles.”\r\n\r\nObviously this cannot apply to the purely historical documents of which\r\nthe collection itself consists. It is, however, strongly suggestive of\r\nthe “Boke of Noblesse,” to which they are, as it were, an appendix, and\r\ncoupled with the evidence of the handwriting of the additions, it leaves\r\nlittle room for doubt that William Worcester was its author. At the same\r\ntime, it is by no means unlikely that Stephen Scrope also had a hand in\r\nit. If indeed it was wholly compiled in 1475, this is impossible, since\r\nhe died in 1472.[95] Assuming, however, for the reason given above, that\r\nit dates from 1451, or thereabouts, he was residing at the time with\r\nFastolf and was no doubt on familiar terms with Worcester. As already\r\nremarked, a prominent feature of the work is the number of extracts\r\ntranslated from the so-called “Arbre de Batailles” of “Dame Cristyn.”\r\nThis, however, was not, as the editor supposed, Honoré Bonet’s treatise\r\nof that name[96] assigned to a wrong author, but Christine de Pisan’s\r\n“Faits d’armes et de chevalerie” under a wrong title.[97] Whether\r\nWorcester was capable of making translations from it as early as 1451 is\r\nsomewhat doubtful; for he seems to have only begun to learn French about\r\nAugust, 1458,[98] little more than a year before Fastolf’s death. Scrope\r\non the contrary had before this translated two French works for the\r\nlatter, one of them being by the same Christine, and it is therefore in\r\nthis part of the “Boke of Noblesse,” if at all, that he may possibly\r\nhave collaborated.\r\n\r\nUnlike the last-named work, the anonymous English version of Cicero’s\r\n“De Senectute” which Caxton printed in 1481 has already been attributed\r\nto William Worcester,[99] the ground of this assumption being an entry\r\nmade in his “Itinerarium,”[100] that on 10th August, 1473, he presented\r\nto Bishop Waynflete at Esher a translation which he had made of this\r\ntreatise, but got nothing in return. Apart from this statement there is\r\nno more reason for attributing Caxton’s text to Worcester than to\r\nScrope. The language is better than might have been expected from either\r\nof them, but as no MS. copy exists, we cannot tell to what extent it was\r\nedited by Caxton. In the preface, as may be seen above (p. xxx.), it is\r\nsaid that the translation was made from the French of Laurence de\r\nPremierfait by Sir John Fastolf’s “ordenaunce and desyre.” As there is\r\nno reason to doubt this, its date cannot be later than 1459, so that, if\r\nWorcester was the translator, he kept it at least thirteen years before\r\nhe offered it to Waynflete. This does not seem very likely, and his\r\ntranslation was therefore possibly a different one altogether, completed\r\nshortly before the occasion when the bishop so disappointed him by his\r\ncold acceptance of it. The earlier version in that case was almost\r\ncertainly by Scrope; but, where so much is left to conjecture, the most\r\nthat can be said is that the evidence upon which it has hitherto been\r\nassigned to Worcester is not wholly conclusive.\r\n\r\n                                                                G.

And trwe it ys, aftyr the storie,\r\nthat in the tyme that grete[115] Troye fflorishede in his grete name a\r\nful wyse ladie callede Othea, consyderyng the ffre thought[116] of\r\nHector of Troye, the which that tyme ffloryshed in vertues, and that it\r\nbe a shewynge of fortunes to be in hym in tyme commynge, sche sent hyme\r\nmany grete and notabil yiftys, and namly the fayre stede that men callyd\r\nGalathee, the which had no felawe in all the worlde. And becavse that\r\nall wordly grace[s] that a good man oughte for to have were in Hector,\r\nmorally we may sey that he toke theyme by the cownsel of Othea, the\r\nwhich sent hyme this pystylle.\r\n\r\nBy Othea we schall vndirstond by the vertu of prudence and of wysedome,\r\nwherewyth he was arayed; and because the Cardinal Vertues ben necessarie\r\nto good pollicie, we schall speke of them, sewynge ich after othyr. And\r\nto þe fryst we have youen a name and takyn a maner of speche in some\r\nwyse poetykly, the bettyr to folewe owre matere acordyng to the very\r\nstorie, and to owre purpoyse we schall take some auctoritees of ancient\r\nphilosophres. Thus we schall sey that by the seyde lady this present was\r\nyovyn or sente to goode Hector, the which in lech wyse may be to all\r\nother desirynge bounte and wysedome. And as the vertue of prudence ought\r\ngretely to be recomendede, Aristotle, the prynce off philosophurs,\r\nseyth, “Becavse that wysedome is þe most noble off all othir thynges, it\r\nschulde be shevyd by the best resone and the most behouely maner that\r\nmyghte be.”\r\n\r\nFore to bryng ayen to allegorie the purpos of owre matyr to owre wordes,\r\nwe schall applique Holy Scrypture to edificacion of the soule, beyng in\r\nwrecheed worlde. As by the grete wysedome and hye myȝte of God all\r\nthynges that be resonabily made all scholde streche to the ende of hyme,\r\nand becawse that owre speryt, mad off God to hys lekenes, is made of\r\nthynges moste noble aftyr the aungelles, it is behouely and necessarie\r\nthat it be arayed wyth vertues, whereby it may be conveyed to the ende\r\nfor the which it was made. And becavse it was lettyd by the assautes of\r\nthe wacches[117] of the enemy of helle, the which is his dedely enemye\r\nand aduersarie and oftyn distourbeth it to come to hys beaute,[118] we\r\nmay calle mankyndely lyfe very cheualrie, as the Scripture seyth in many\r\npartes, and standyng[119] all erthyly thynges[120] be desceyvable,[121]\r\nwe schulde haue in contynuell mynde the tyme [Sidenote: f. 7.] for to\r\ncome, which is wythowte ende. And because this is the grete wysedome of\r\nperfite knygthhode and that all othir be of no comparison to regarde of\r\nthe victorius peple the which be corounede in blys, we schal take a\r\nmaner of speche of gostly knyhthode, that [is] to be done princypally to\r\nthe preysynge of God and to the profyth of thoo þat wylle delyte theyme\r\nto here this present dittee.\r\n\r\nHowe prudence and wysedome is modyr and conditoures of all vertues,\r\nwythowte the which the tothire may not be well gouernede, it is\r\nnecessarie to gostly knyghthode to be arayed wyth prudence, as Seynte\r\nAustyn seyth in the book of Singularite off Clerkes,[122] that in what\r\nmaner of place prudence be men may lyghtly cesse and amende[123] all\r\ncontrarius thynges, but there w[h]ere prudence is despisyd all\r\ncont[r]arius thynges hath domynacyon. And to this purpoose Salamon seyth\r\nin his Proverbis, “Si [intraverit sapientia cor tuum et scientia animæ\r\ntuæ placuerit, consilium custodiet te et prudentia servabit te.”][124]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II.\r\n\r\n        And to the entent that know may be\r\n        What thou schuldeste do, drawe vnto þe\r\n        The vertues that may the most restore,\r\n        The bettir to come to that seyde afore\r\n        Of the worshipful chevalroures.[125]\r\n        Allthoughe that it be aventerous,\r\n        Yet schall I sey whi that I sey thus.\r\n        A cosyn germayne[126] I haue, I wys.\r\n        Fullefyllyd sche is beaute wyth all;\r\n        But of all thynges in specyall\r\n        Sche ys ful softe and temperede full wele;\r\n        Of stroke of ire felyth sche no dele; [Sidenote: f. 8.]\r\n        Sche thynkkyth no thynge but of rygth balance.\r\n        It is the godesse of Temperance.\r\n        I may not all only but by hyre face\r\n        Haue the name of that by myghty grace;\r\n        For yef the weghte ne were sche to the made,\r\n        The all were not worthe a leke blade.[127]\r\n        Therefor I wyll that with me sche love the.\r\n        Yf she wyll, lete hire note forgetyn be;\r\n        For she is ryght a wele lerned godesse,\r\n        Hyr witte I love and prays myche in distrese.\r\n\r\nOthea seyth that Temperance is here cosyn germayne,[128] the which he\r\nschuld loue; for the vertu of temperance may veryly be seyde cosyn\r\ngermayne and lykennd [to] prudence, for temperans is schewer of prudence\r\nand of prudence folwyth temperance. Therefor it is seide that he shulde\r\nhold hyr for his love; and euery good knygth shulde do the same, that\r\ndesiryth due prayse of goode peple. As the philosophre Demetricus[129]\r\nseyth, “Temperance moderath vices and perfyteth vertues.”\r\n\r\nThe good spiryte shuld haue the vertue of temperance, the whiche [hath]\r\nthe propirte to lemyte and to sede on syde superfluytes.[130] For Seynt\r\nAustyn seyth in the book of the condycions[131] ... of concupyscence,\r\nthe whiche be contrary to vs and lettyth vs from Godes lawe, and more\r\nalso to dispite fleschely delytys and worldly praysynge.

Hercules was a knyghte of\r\nGrece of meruelyous strengh and broute to ende many knyghtly worthines.\r\nA grete iorneyer he was in the worlde, and, for the grete and meruelyous\r\nviagis and thinges of grete strenghe that he made and dede, the poietes,\r\nthe wyche spak couertly and in maner of fable, seyde that he wente into\r\nhelle to fygth wyth the prynces off helle and that [he] favth[143] wyth\r\nserpentes and fiers bestis, by the wyche is to vndirstonden the grete\r\nand stronge entreprises.[144] * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV.\r\n\r\n               *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n        Elles arte thou note worthy an helme to were, [Sidenote: f. 10.]\r\n        Ne for to gouerne a reaume nowhere.[145]\r\n\r\nPrudence seith to the good knyghte that, yf he will be on of the goode\r\nmennes rowe, he most haue the vertue of iustice, that is to seye,\r\nryghtwyse iustice. And Aristotle seith he that is a rytewyse iusticer\r\nfryst shulde iustifie hym selph, ffor he that iustifies not hym self is\r\nnot worthi to iustifye anothir. This is to vndirstond that a man shulde\r\ncorrecte his owne defavtes, so þat thei be holy fordone, and than a man\r\nso correctid may wele, and schulde, be a corrector of othir men. And to\r\nspeke morally, ve shall tell a fable to this purpoise vndir the\r\ncouertvre of poyetis. Minos, as poyetis sey, is a iusticer off helle or\r\na prouoste or a cheife bayle, and afore hym is broughte alle the sowles\r\ndescendyng into that vaylie; and afftir that they haue disseruede of\r\npenance as many degrees as he wille that thei be sette deipe, as ofte he\r\nturnyth his tayle abwte hym. And becawse that he is thee iustice ande\r\nthe punyschment of God, lete vs take owre maner to speke oure speche\r\nveryly to that purpose. O trouth there was a kyng in Grece[146] called\r\nMynos of mervelious fairnes,[147] and in hym was grete rigoure of\r\niustice; and therefor the poietis seyde that aftir his deth he was\r\ncommytted to be iusticer of helle. And Aristotile seyth, “Justice is a\r\nmesure that God hath sette in erthe for to limitte thereby thynges\r\nryghtwysly.”\r\n\r\nAnd even as God is hede of iustice and of all orderes, it is necessarye\r\nto the cheualerous sperit that wille come to the victorius blysse for to\r\nhave this vertue. And Seynt Bernard seith in a sermone[148] that iustice\r\nis not ellis but to giffe euery man that his is. “Yife than,” seith he,\r\n“to .iii. maner of peple that the whiche is theires, that is to say, to\r\nthi souereyne, to thi felawe and to thi soget: to thi souereyne\r\nreuerence and obeissance of body; to thi falawe thou schulde gyffe\r\ncounsel and helpe, counsel in teschyng hym where he is ignorant and\r\nhelpe hym in comfortynge his owyn power[149]; to thi soget, thow\r\nschuldest gyf hym chastissyng and kepyng hym frome euyl dedes, in\r\nchastisyng[150] hym forgiffeyng hym that he hath doo amysse.” And thus\r\nhereto seyth Salomon in his Proverbis, “Ex[cogitat iustus de domo impii\r\nut detrahat impios a malo.... Gaudium est iusto facere iusticiam”].[151]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V.\r\n\r\n        Also remenbre the of Percyvale,[152] [Sidenote: f. 11.]\r\n        Whos name is knowen ouer alle\r\n        Throwghowte the worlde, both soft and hard,\r\n        The swyffte hors Pegasus afterward.\r\n        He roode hyme through the eyre flyyng,\r\n        And Andromeda in hys goyng\r\n        Fro the bellue[153] he hyr delyueryd\r\n        And wyth his streynght hir from hym revede,\r\n        As a ryght good errant myghtty knyghte\r\n        Brought hyr ageyne to hir kyne ful ryght.\r\n        Thys dede in yowre mynde loke that it holde,\r\n        For a good knyght shuld kepe that is bolde\r\n        Thys wey, if that he will haue exprese\r\n        Wyrchip, which is mych better than ryches.\r\n        Hys shynnynge shelde than loke thou opon,\r\n        The which haue euer ouercome many one.\r\n        Wythe his fauchon loke that thou arme the,\r\n        Both strong and stedefast than shalt thou be.\r\n\r\nAnd because that it is acordyng thyng[154] for a good knyght to haue\r\nwirchip and reuerence, we shalle make a fygure aftyr the maner of\r\npoietis. Percevale was a ful worthi knyght and whan[155] many reaumes,\r\nand the name off the grete lande of Perce come of hyme. And poyetis\r\nseide that he roode the hors that flawe in the eyre, the which was\r\ncalled Pegasus; and that is to vnderstonde a goode name, the which\r\nflyeth through the eyre. He bare in his honde a fauchon or a glayve; the\r\nwhiche is seide for the grete multytude of peple that were discomfyte by\r\nhym in maney batayles. He delyueryd Andromeda from the bellue; this was\r\na kynggys doghter, the which he delyuered from a monstre of the see, the\r\nwhich by the sentence of the godes shulde a[156] deuoured hire. This is\r\nto vndirstonde that alle knyghtes shulde socovre women that hade nede of\r\nthere socoure. This Percivale and the hors [Sidenote: f. 12.] the which\r\nfleeth[157] may[158] be notede for the good name that a goode knyghte\r\nshulde haue and gete by hys good desertes; and there shuld he ryde, that\r\nis to seye, that hys goode name shulde be borne in all contrees. And\r\nAristotile seyth that a good name of a man maketh a name shynnyng to the\r\nworlde and agreable in presence of princes.\r\n\r\nThe cheualerours sperit shulde desyre a goode name among the felachipe\r\nof the seyntis of heuen gotten by his goode desertes. The good hors\r\nPegasus that [beareth][159] hyme shall be his good angel, the which\r\nshall make good reporte off hyme at the day of dome. Andromeda that shal\r\nbe delyuered, it is his sowle, the which he delyueres fro the feend of\r\nhell by the ouercomyng off synne. And that a man on the same maner wyse\r\nshuld wylne to haue a good name in this worlde to the plesaunce of God\r\nand not for vayne glorie, Seynt Austin seyth in the Booke of\r\nCorreccion[160] that “ii. thyngges be necessarie to beleve wele,[161]\r\nthat is to sey, good conscience and good name, conscience for\r\nfeyth,[162] good name for his neyburwe; and [w]ho so trostyth in\r\nconscience and dyspiteth a good name, he is cruel”; for it is a synge of\r\na nobyll corage to loue the wele of a good name. And to this purpoise\r\nseyth the wyse man, “Curam habe [de bono nomine, magis enim permanebit\r\ntibi quam mille thesauri preciosi”].[163]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VI.\r\n\r\n        And wyth thyne inclynacions\r\n        Off Jouis[164] softe condiccions\r\n        Loke thou haue; the better thou shalt be,\r\n        Whene that thow kepes theme ryghtfulle.\r\n\r\nAs it is seyde, poyetis, the whiche worchipped many godes, they helde\r\nthe planetis of heuen ffor speciall godes, and of the .vii. planetes\r\nthey made the .vii. dayes of the weke. They worchypped and helde Jouis\r\nor Jubiter for there grettest god, because that he is sette in the hyest\r\nspere of the planetis vndyr Saturne. The day off Thurseday is named of\r\nJouis. And anamely the philosophres yaf and compared the vertues of\r\nthe .vii. metallis to the .vii. planetis and named the teremys of there\r\nsciences by the same planetis, as a man may se in Geber[165] and\r\nNicholas[166] and in othir auctoris of that science. To Jouys is youyne\r\ncopyr or bras. Jouis or Jubiter is a planete of softe condicion, amiable\r\nand ful gladde and fygure[167] to sanguyne comp[l]eccion. Therefor Othea\r\nseyth, that is to sey, Prudence, that a good knyght shuld haue the\r\ncondicion of Jubiter, and the same shulde euery nobyll man haue,\r\npursewyng knyghtthode. [Sidenote: f. 13.] To this purpose seythe\r\nPictogoras[168] that a kyng shuld be gracyously conuersaunt wyth his\r\npeple and shew to them a glade visage; and on the same wyse it is to\r\nvnderstond off all wordly peple tendyng to wirchippe.\r\n\r\nNow lete vs brynge to owre purpoyse in allegorie the properteis of\r\nthe .vii. planetis. Jouis, the which is a softe and a mankyndly[169]\r\nplanete, of the whyche the good knyght schulde haue condicions, may\r\nsygnifie to vs mercy and compassyon that the good knyght hade, Jhesu\r\nCryste that is, the which the sperit schulde haue in hym selfe. For\r\nSeynte Gregorie seyth in the pistylle of Pontian,[170] “I remembre not,”\r\nseith he, “that euer I herde or redde that he dyed of heuy dethe that\r\nhathe wylle to fulfylle the dedes of mercy, ffor mercy hathe many\r\nprayeres and it is inpossyble but that many prayeres most nedes be\r\nexauced.” To this purpose oure Lord seythe in the Gospell, “Beati\r\n[misericordes, quoniam ipsi misericordiam consequentur”].[171]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VII.\r\n\r\n        Off Venus in no wyse make thi godesse,\r\n        And for no thynge sette store by here promysse.\r\n        To folowe here it is rauenous,[172]\r\n        Both vnworchippefull and peryllous.\r\n\r\nVenus is a planete of heuen, aftyr whome the Fryday is named; and the\r\nmetall that we call tynne or pewter is yovyn to the same. Venus yiffeth\r\ninfluence of loue and of ydylnes, and she was a lady called soo, the\r\nwhich was qwene of Cippre. And because that [she] excedyd all women in\r\nexcellent beaute and jolynesse, and was ryght amerous and not stedefast\r\nin o loue, and becawse that she yevyth influence of lecheri, Othea seyth\r\nto the good knyght that he make here not his godes. This is to\r\nvndirstond, that in sech lyfe he shuld not abaundon his body ne his\r\nentent. Armes[173] seyth that the vice of lecherye steynyth all vertues.\r\n\r\nVenus, of whom the good knyght shuld not make hys godes, it is þat the\r\ngood speryth in hym selphe shuld haue no vanyte. And Cassidore seyth\r\nvpon the Sawtyr, “Vanite made avoyde degre[174] to becum a fende and\r\nyafe dethe[175] to the fryste man and voyeddid hyme frome the\r\nblyssidnesse that was grawntyd on to hyme.” Vanite is modyr off all\r\nevelles, welle off all vices, and the weyne[176] of wykydnesse, the\r\nwhich puttyth a man oute of the grace of God and setti[t]h hym in his\r\nhate. To this purpose Dauid seyth in his Sauter, spekyng to God, “Odisti\r\n[observantes vanitates supervacue”].[177]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 VIII.\r\n\r\n        Yf thou asemble the in jugement, [Sidenote: f. 14.]\r\n        Be leke to Saturne in avisement;\r\n        Or that thou gyf thy sentence, veryly\r\n        Be ware that thou yif it not doutously.\r\n\r\nSatyrday is named after Saturne, ande the metall lede is youen therto,\r\nand it is a planete of slow condicion, hevy and wyse. And there was a\r\nkyng in Grece hadde the same name, the [which] was full wyse, off whom\r\npoyetis spake vnder conuerteure of fable, and they seyde that his sone\r\nJubiter kutte from hym his preuy menbres. The which is to vnderstond\r\nthat he toke ffrom hym his myghte and dysheryted him and drwe[178] hym\r\navay. And becawse that Saturne is hevy and wyse, Othea seyth that a good\r\nknyght shuld peyse a thynge grettely or[179] that he[180] shulde yefe\r\nhis sentence, weythir that it be in pris of armes or of ony othir dede.\r\nAnd euery iuge may not[181] the same that hathe offices longgynge to\r\niugement. And to thys purpoise Hermes seith, “Thynkke wele on all\r\nthinges that thou hast for to do and in especyall of iugement of othyr.”\r\n\r\nAs the good knyghte scholde be slowe in the iugement of othir, that is\r\nto sey, to peise wele the sentence or þat he gyf it, on the same wyse\r\nthe goode spiryte shulde doo in that the which longyth to hyme; for to\r\nGode longeth the iugement, the which can discerne cawses ryghtwysly. And\r\nSeynt Grigorye seyth in hys Moralles[182] that, whan owre frelnes cannot\r\ncomprehende the iugementes of God, we oughte not to discute them in\r\nbolde wordes, but we ought to worchippe thyme wyth ferefull scilens and,\r\nhow mervelyous that euer we thowght theyme, we shulde holde them iuste.\r\nAnd to this purpoose spekyth Dauid in the Sawter-booke, “Timor [Domini\r\nsanctus, permanet in seculum seculi. Judicia Domini vera iustificata in\r\nsemet ipsa”].[183]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IX.\r\n\r\n        Lete thi worde be clere and trwe in kynde.\r\n        Appollo shall gif it the in mynde,\r\n        For he by no mene may non ordure\r\n        Suffir no wyse vndere couerture.\r\n\r\nAppollo or Phebus, that is the sone, to whom the Sonday is yoven and\r\nallsoo the metall that is callyd golde. The sonne by hys clerenes\r\nshewyth thynges that be hidde; and therefore trewth, the whiche is clere\r\nand shewith secrete thynges, may be yofe to hyme. The which vertue\r\nshulde be in the herte and in the mowthe of euery good knyghte. And to\r\nthis purpose seyth Hermes, “Love Godde, trowthe euer, and gyffe good\r\ncounsell.”\r\n\r\nApollo, the whiche is to sey the sonne, by whom we notyfye trowthe, we\r\nmay take that man shulde haue in hys mouth the trwthe of the very knyght\r\nJhesu Cryst and flee all falsenes. As Cassiodyr seyth in the booke of\r\nPraysyng of Seynt Powle,[184] “The condicion of falsenes ys swche that,\r\nwhere as it hath no geyneseyyng, yit it falleth in hym selphe; butte the\r\ncondycion of trowth is to the contrary, ffor it is so sete that the more\r\ngeyneseynges of aduersytes that it hath, the more it encresyth and\r\nreysyth hym selphe.” To this purpose seith Holy Scripture, “Super [omnia\r\nvincit veritas].”[185]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   X.\r\n\r\n        Vnto Phebe resemble not. For why?\r\n        He[186] is to chaungable and enemye\r\n        To stedefastnes and to courage strong,\r\n        Malencolius is and full of wronge.\r\n\r\nPhebe is called the mone, off whom the Moneday hath his name; and to\r\nhyme is yoven the metall that we calle syluyr. The mone resteth non oure\r\nin a ryghte poynte and yiffeth influens of vnstefastenes and foly, and\r\ntherefore it is seyde þat a goode knyght shulde kepe hym from which\r\nvicys. And to this purpose Hermes seith, “Vse wisedome and be\r\nstedefast.”\r\n\r\nPhebe the moone, that we not for vnstedefastnes, the whiche a goode\r\nknyght shulde not haue; on the same wyse the good sperit. As Seynt\r\nAmbrose seith in the pistil of Simpliciain,[187] that a foole is\r\nschawnegeable as the moone, but a wyse man is euer stedefast in o state,\r\nwhere he neythir brekyth for fere ner schawngyth for no myght; he\r\nreyseth hym notte in prosperite ner plangeth not in heuynes.[188] “There\r\nwhere wysedome is, there is vertue, strengh and stedefastnes. The wise\r\nman is euer of oon corage; it lessyth it notte, ne encressyth not, for\r\n[he] schawngyth notte in no maner wyse for no thyng; he flotereth not in\r\ndyuers opynions, but abydyth perfythe in Jhesu Cryst, gon growndid in\r\ncharite and roted in feyth.” And to this purpose seythe Holy Scripture,\r\n“Homo sanctus [in sapientia manet sicut sol, nam stultus sicut luna\r\nmutatur”].[189]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XI.\r\n\r\n        I dowte notte in no wyse Mars thi fadyr.\r\n        Thow shalt folowe hyme in heuery matyr;\r\n        For thy hy and nobil condycion\r\n        Draweth therto thyne inclynacion.\r\n\r\nThe Twysday is named after Mars; and that metalle that we [Sidenote: f.\r\n16.] callen iren is youen to hym. Mars is a planete that yifeth\r\ninfluence of werris and batayles; therefore euery knyght that loveth and\r\nschewyth armes and dedes of knyghthod and hathe a grete name off\r\nworthines may be callyd the sone of Mars. And therfor Othea named Hector\r\nso, notwythstondyng he was sone to Knyng Pryant, and seyde he wolde well\r\nfolowe hys fadir in as moche as a goode knyght ought to doo. And a wyse\r\nman seith that by the dedes of a man men may knowe his inclynacions.\r\n\r\nMars the god of bateyle may wele be called the Sone of God, the whiche\r\nbateilled victoriously in this worlde, by example; [and the good sperit\r\nshulde] folow[190] his Fadere Jhesu Cryst and fyght ayens vicis. Seynte\r\nAmbrose seyth in the fryst booke off Offices that how so will be Godes\r\nfrend, he must be the fendes enemy, whoo so will haue pees wyth Jhesu\r\nCryst, he most haue werre withe vices. And even as in veyne men maketh\r\nwerre in the felde wyth foreyne enemys there where the cete is full of\r\nhomely spyes, on the same wyse non may ouercome the eveles outewarde\r\nthat wyll not were strongly wyth the synnes of there sowlys; ffor it is\r\nthe most gloryous victorie that may be, for a man to ouercome hyme\r\nselphe. And tho this purpose seyth Seynt Poule the postyle, [“Non est\r\nvobis colluctatio adversus carnem et sanguinem sed adversus principes et\r\npotestates,” etc.].[191]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XII.\r\n\r\n        Of thi faucon[192] be thou bolde and pleyne,\r\n        And of thi worde bothe clene and certeyne.\r\n        Mercurye schall teche the that, holde[193] and sounde,\r\n        The which of good spech knowyth wele the grounde.\r\n\r\nThe Wednysday is named after Mercurye, [the which] ys a planete that\r\nyevyth influence off pontificall behavynge and of fayre langage arayed\r\nwyth retorique. Therefor it is seide to the good knyte that he shulde be\r\narayed therewyth, for wirchipfull behavynge and faire langage ys full\r\nbehovely to all nobill pepyll desyryng the hy pris of worchipe, so that\r\nthey kepe them fro to myche langage; ffor Dyogeneys seyth that off all\r\nvertues the more the bettir, saue of speche.\r\n\r\nBe Mercurie, the whiche is called god of langage, we may [Sidenote: f.\r\n17.] vndirstonde that the knyghte of Jhesu Cryste shulde be armed wyth\r\ngood prechynges and wordes of techynges, and all so thei shulde loue and\r\nworchyppe the schewers thereof. And Seynte Gregory seithe in his Omelyis\r\nþat men shulde haue the prechores of Holy Scripture in grete reuerence,\r\nfor they be the masseyngeres that gone to[fore][194] owre Lord God and\r\nowre Lorde followyth them. Holy prechyng maketh the way, and than owre\r\nLord commeth into the dwellyng place of owre hert; the wordes of\r\nexortacion maketh the coorse, and so trwthe is reseyuyd intoo owre\r\nvndirstondyng. And to this purpose owre Lorde seyth to his aposteles,\r\n[“Qui vos audit me audit, et qui vos spernit me spernit”].[195]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XIII.\r\n\r\n        Of all maner sortes of armure\r\n        For to arme the wyth, bothe wele and sure,\r\n        Be thi moder inough sygned shall be,[196]\r\n        Mynerve, the which is not bitter to the.\r\n\r\nMynerve was a lady of grete connyng and fonde the craft to make armure;\r\nfor afore the pe[p]yl armed theyme but wyth cuirboyle.[197] And for the\r\ngrete wysdom that was in this lady thei called hyr a godes; and because\r\nthat Hector cowde sette armure welle on werke and that it was hys ryght\r\ncraft, Othea called hym the sone of Mynerve, notwythstondyng that he was\r\nsone to qwen Ecuba of Troye. And in the same wyse all that loueth armes\r\nmay be named. And to this purpose an auctoure seith that knyghtes youen\r\nto armes be soggettes to the same.\r\n\r\nWhere it is seide that good armurs and strong inewgh shall be delyuered\r\nto the good knygh by his modir, wee may vndirstond the vertu of feyth,\r\nthe whiche is a devyne vertue and is modir to the good spyrite. And that\r\nshe delyuerith armoures inow, Cassiodir seythe in the Exposicion of the\r\nCrede[198] that feyth is the lyth[199] of the sowle, the yate off\r\nparadyse, the wynddowe of lyve, and the gronde of the euerlastyng\r\nhelthe, for wythowte feythe non may plese God. And to this purpose seyth\r\nSeynt Poule in the pystyll, [“Sine fide impossibile est placere\r\nDeo”].[200]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XIV.\r\n\r\n        Joyne thou to the Pallas the godesse,\r\n        And sette hir ryght wyth thi worthinesse.\r\n        Yf thow haue hir, good fortune thou shalt fele;\r\n        Pallas wyth Mynerve is fittyng[201] full wele.\r\n\r\nAll so where it is seyde that Pallas sholde be ioyned wyth Mynerve, the\r\nwhich is wele fyttyng, men shall vndirstonde that Pallas and Mynerve ys\r\nall o thyng, but the names be diueres and be takyn to .ii.\r\nvndirstondynges. For the lady that is callyd [Sidenote: f. 18.] Mynerve\r\nwas so surnamed Pallas of an yle that is called Pallance[202] of the\r\nwhiche she was borne; and because that she generally in all thynges was\r\nwyse and foonde many nwe craftes, fayre and sotle, thei called hyr\r\ngoodes of kunnyng. Mynerve is called thus in that which longeth too\r\nknyghthode, and Pallas in all thynges that longeth to wysdom; and\r\ntherefore it is seyde that he sholde yeuen[203] wysdom and knythhode,\r\nthe which is ful wele acordvng therto, and that armes shulde be keptte\r\nmay be vndirstonde be feyth. To this purpose seythe Hermes, “Joyne the\r\nloue of feithe wyth wisedom.”\r\n\r\nAnd as that Pallas, the whiche is notyd for wysedom, shulde be ioyned\r\nwith knyghthode, the vertue[204] of hope shuld be ioyned with good\r\nvertues of the knyghtly speryte, wyhtowte the which he may not avayle.\r\nFor Orygene seyth in the Omelies opon Exode that the hoope of the goodes\r\nthat be for to come is the solase of theyme that trauellyth in this\r\nbodely lyffe, leche as to laboreres the hoope of there payment softeth\r\nthere laboures off there besynes, and as [to] champyons that be in\r\nbateyle the hoope of the corowne of victorie esyth the woo of there\r\nwondes. And to this purpose seyth Seynt Poule the apostyll,\r\n[“Fortissimum solatium habemus, qui confugimus ad tenendam propositam\r\nspem,” etc.].[205]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XV.\r\n\r\n        Pantassele[206] haue thou fauour vnto,\r\n        That ffor thi deth shall haue moch woo;\r\n        Syth a woman shuld be loued and knowe,\r\n        Off whom so noble a voys is sowe.[207]\r\n\r\nPantasselle was a ful fayre mayden and qwen of Damazonie[208] and off\r\nmervelyous worthines in armes and in hardines; and for the grete goodnes\r\nthat the hy name witnessed through the worlde of Hector the worthy she\r\nloved hyme ryght hertyly, and fro the parties of the est she come to\r\nTroye in the tyme of the grete segge for to se Hector. But qwen she fond\r\nhym dede, she was owte off mesure hevy and wyth a grete oste [of] ful\r\ncheualrous gentilwomen vigerously she vengyd his dethe, where she dide\r\nmervelyous worthynesses. And many grete greuaunces she dide to the\r\nGrekes. And because she was vertuouse, it is seide to the good knyght\r\nthat he shuld love hyr, and that is to vndirstonde that euery good\r\nknyght shulde loue and prayse euer[y] vertuous persone, anamely a woman\r\nin strong vertue of wytte and off concyens. And this woman that is\r\nwoofull for the dethe of Hector is vndirstonde by worthines and valure,\r\nwhen it is dull and deded in knyghthode. And a wyse man seyth, “Bounte\r\nshulde be alowyd where that it is perceyued.”\r\n\r\nBe Pantasselle, that was socourable, we may vndirstonde the [Sidenote:\r\nf. 19.] vertue off cherite, the whiche is the .iii^e. devyne vertue that\r\nthe good speryte shuld perfytely haue in hym self. Cassyodir[209] seith\r\nthat charyte is as the reyne, the which fallyth in the prime temps, for\r\nit distillyth the dropes of vertues, vndir the whiche greine [of] good\r\nwille groweth[210] and good hoope fructifyeth, that is to be pacient in\r\naduersite, tempered in prosperyte, pacient in mekenesse, ioyeus in\r\nafflicciones, wellwyllyng to his enemyes and frendes, anamely to his\r\nenemyes to be comuniall of his goodis.[211] To this purpose seyth Poule\r\nthe postel, [“Caritas patiens est, benigna est, caritas non emulatur,\r\nnon agit perperam,” etc.].[212]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XVI.\r\n\r\n        Narcisus[213] looke ye resemble not,\r\n        Nor into mych pride knyt your knot;\r\n        For to ouerwenyng hawteyn knyght\r\n        Off many a grace is voide full ryght.\r\n\r\nNarcisus [was] a yonge bachelere that ffor his grete beaute seysyd hym\r\nin so grete pride[214] that he hadde all other in disprayes. And because\r\nthat he praysed noon but hym selphe, it is seyde that he was so amerous\r\nand assottede of hym selfe that he dyede after that he hade beholden hym\r\nselfe in the welle. This is to vndirstonde by the ouerwenyng or\r\nouctrecuidez man of hym selfe, wherein he beholdyth hym.[215] Therefor\r\nit is diffendyth the good knyght to beholde hym selfe in hys good dedes,\r\nwhere throwe he myght be ouerwenyng. And to this purpose seith Socrates,\r\n“Sone, be ware thou be not disseyvyd in thi beaute of thi youthe, ffor\r\nthat is no durable thyng.”\r\n\r\nNow lete vs sette an allegorie applyyng to owre purpose to the .vii.\r\ndedely synnys. Be Narcisus we shall vndirstond the synne of pride, fro\r\nthe wyche the goode speryte shulde kepe hym. And Orygene seyth in the\r\nOmelees, “Whereof it is that erth and asshes prydeth hyme, or how derre\r\na man rayse hym in arogance, when he thynketh whereof he is comyn and\r\nwhat he shall become, and in how frele a vessel his[216] lyff is all\r\nnaked and in what harlotrees he is plongeden and what onclene maters he\r\nsesseth neuer to cast from hys flesch be all the condittes off hys\r\nbody?” And to this purpose seith Holy Scripture, [“Si ascenderit ad\r\ncœlum superbia ejus et caput ejus nubes tetigerit, quasi sterquilinium\r\nin fine perdetur”].[217]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XVII.\r\n\r\n        Athamas full of ryght grete madnes, [Sidenote: f. 20.]\r\n        The goodes verily of woodnes,\r\n        She feirsly strangled hir childern tweyne.[218]\r\n        Therefor ire I thefende the pleyne.\r\n\r\nAthamas was a kyng maried to qwene Yno, the which made sothyn[219] corne\r\nto be sowne for to disheryte hyr[220] stepe childire, for she[221] with\r\nmony coromped the prestes of the lawe, the which reported the answeres\r\nof the godes, thus seyyng to the kyng or to theyme of the cuntre that\r\nthe corne that the men hadden sowene profyted not, where it plesyd the\r\ngodes that .ii.^o fayre and ientyl childir the whiche the kyng hade were\r\ndreven away and exiled. And becawse that the kyng consentyd [to] the\r\nexillyng of the .ii.^o childyrne, all though that he dyde [it] ayens hys\r\nwylle and wyth grete sorowe, the fabyl seyth that the godes Iuno[222]\r\nwolde take vengance therefor and went into helle to compleyne to the\r\ngodesse of woodnes that sche myght come to the kyng Athamas. Than the\r\norrible and the fereful goodes come with all hir serpently herres and\r\nsette hyr on the fumerelle[223] of the palais and streged hir armes to\r\nbothe sydys of the yate, and than there began sych stryfe betwene the\r\nkyng and the qwene that werrant[224] yche of them hade slayne othir. And\r\nwhan they wend a hade rune oute of the palais, than þe woode goodes drwe\r\nout of hyr ryght foule herres .ii^o. horrible serpentis and kest in\r\nthere lappes; and qwen that the goodes saw theyme so ferefull,[225] than\r\nthey wexe both madde. Athamas slewe the qwene for woodnes and than\r\nhis .ii.^o childerne, and hym selfe leep into the see of frome a h[i]ght\r\nroche. The exposycion of this fable may wele be that a qwen myght be so\r\ndyuers to stepe chyldirne that for some malice she myght disheryte hem,\r\nfor the which after pes myght notte be hadde betwene the fadir and the\r\nsteppe modir. And it myght be soo that at the last he slewe theyme. And\r\nbecause that ire is a dedly vice and soo evyle that he that is sore\r\nteynt therewyth hath no knowyng of reson, it is seide to the goode\r\nknyght that he shuld kepe hym from ire, for it is too grete defaute in a\r\ngoode knyght to be angry. And there[fore] Arystotile seithe “Kepe the\r\nfrom ire, for it trobelyth the vndyrstondyng and destroubeth reson.”\r\n\r\nBe Athamas, the which was soo full of ire, we shall propirly vnderstond\r\nthe synne of ire, the whiche the goode spyryte shuld woyde from hyme.\r\nAnd Seynte Austyn seith in a pistyll, “Lech as venegre, where it is\r\npoote, corrompeth the vessell that it is in, yf it abyde longe therinne,\r\nso ire corrumpyth the hert wherein it is sette, yf that it abyde long\r\nthereinne, that is to seye fro day to day.”[226] [Sidenote: f. 21.]\r\nTherfor seyth Seynt Poule the postell, [“Sol non occidat super\r\niracundiam vestram”].[227]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XVIII.\r\n\r\n        Off all thyng that thou may se with ey\r\n        Fle euer the fals godes envie,\r\n        That made Aglaros[228] grennere than ivie,\r\n        The which to a ston chaunged was þerby.\r\n\r\nA ffable seyth that Aglaros was systyr to Herce, the which was soo feire\r\nthat for hir beaute Mercurius the god of langage wedded hyr, and thei\r\nweyre Cycropos doghters, kyng off Athenes. But Aglaros hade so mych\r\nenvie to hir syster Herce, the which for beaute was so avaunced as to be\r\nmaried to a god, that sche become throw here ensorgyng in envye dry[229]\r\nand discolourd and grene as ivy leffe for the envie that she hade to hyr\r\nsystyr. On a day Aglaros was sette on the thresshefolde of the dore and\r\nlettyd Mercurius the entre into the hous, ne for no prayowr that he\r\nprayed hyre she woolde not suffre hym to hentre. Then the gode wexe\r\nwroothe and seide that euer myght she abide there stylle, as harde as\r\nhyr corage was; and than Aglaros becomme as hard as a stone. Thys fable\r\nmay be lekend in leche case to fall to some personys. Mercurius may be a\r\nmyghty man, weele spekynge, the which made his sistir to be presound or\r\nto dye for some displesure that she hade doon to hyme, and therefor it\r\nis seide that she was chaunged to a stone. And becawse it is to folow a\r\naspotte[230] ayens ientylnes to be envyous, it is seide to the goode\r\nknyght that of all thynges he kepte hym therfro. And Socrates seyth, “He\r\nthat beryth the fardell of envie hathe perpetuell peyne.”\r\n\r\nLyche as this auctorite dyffendyth the good knyghte envie the vice, Holy\r\nScripture defendyth the good spyryte. And Seynt Austyn seyth[231] that\r\nenvie ys hate of othir felycite, for the dedes of the envyos man\r\nstrecheth ayens tho that be gretter than he by cawse that he is not so\r\ngrete as they, ayens tho that be evenly to hyme because that he is notte\r\ngretter than they, and ayens tho that be lesse than he for fere that\r\nthey shold wexe as grete as he. To this purpose Holy Scripture seyth,\r\n[“Nequam est oculus invidi et avertens faciem suam”].[232]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XIX.\r\n\r\n        Ferre ne[233] slowe be ware that thou not be;\r\n        Fro[234] the malyce loke that thou kepe the\r\n        Off Vlyxes, that the geauntes ye[235]\r\n        Stale, though he looke neuer so clerely.\r\n\r\nA ffable seyth that, when Vlixes retorned into Grece aftir the\r\n[Sidenote: f. 22.] destruccion off Troye, grete rages of tempestes\r\nbrought hys chip into an ile where a geaunt was that hade but on eye in\r\nthe myddes of his forred, the whiche was of an hooges gretnes. Vlixes by\r\nhy sutylte stale it and toke it fro hym, that ys to saye he putte it\r\nowte. This is to vndyrstond that the good knyght shulde be ware that\r\nslowthe ouercome hym not with disseytes and willes of malycyous peple,\r\nso that his eye be not takyn away, that is to seye, the eye of his\r\nvndirstondynge in his worchip, in his gettyng or in that the which is\r\nderrer to hym, as many inconu[en]iencies falleth ofte throwe slowthe and\r\nlachesse. And to this purpose Hermes seythe, “Blyssyd is he that vsyth\r\nhys dayes in dwe occupacions.”\r\n\r\nWhere it is seide that the good knygh shulde not be ferre ne slowe, we\r\nmay vndyrstond the synne of slewthe, the which the good spiryte shuld\r\nnot haue. For, as Bede[236] seith in Salomones Prouerbes, the slowe man\r\nis not worthi to rengne with God, the which wil not laboure for the lowe\r\nof God, and he is not worthi to receyve the coronne promysyd to knyghtes\r\nthat is a coward to vndyrtake feldes of baytaile. Therefor the Scripture\r\nseyth, [“Cogitationes robusti semper in abundantia, omnis autem piger\r\nsemper in egestate est”].[237]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XX.\r\n\r\n        In no wyse stryve wyth no frosses,[238]\r\n        Ne defoule the not in there brothes.\r\n        Ayens Lathonna thei assembled sore,\r\n        And trobled the clere water hir afore.\r\n\r\nThe fable seith that the godesse Lathonna was modyr to Phebus and to\r\nPhebe, the which is the sone and the moone, and she bare theyme both in\r\nher wombe. Juno chased hir in euery contre becawse she was conseyvyd\r\nwyth Jubiter hir housbond. On a day the godesse Lathonna was trauelled\r\ngretly, and she arivede on a wassh and than she aboode opon the watter\r\nfor to stawnsh hyr grete thyrste there where a grete feleshyp of carles\r\nwere ffor to bathe them in the watyr ffor the hete of the sone. And\r\n[they] began to chide Lathonna and trobylyd hyr watyr that she\r\n[thought][239] to haue dronkyn of, and for no prayer that she made they\r\nwolde not suffyr hir drynke ne had no pete of hyre myschefe. Than she\r\ncoursyd theyme and seyde that euer aftyr mote they abyde stylle in the\r\nbroththe[240]; than were they fowle and abominable and cesyd neuer of\r\nbrayeng ne chydyng. So the carles become frosshes, the which neuer\r\nsythyn cessed of brayng, as it shewyth in somer tyme by reuerys sydys.\r\nThis may be takyn be communes that dedde some dysplesur to summe grete\r\nmaystres, the which made them to be cast in a reuer and to be drounede,\r\nand thus become they [Sidenote: f. 23.] frosshes. And it is to\r\nvndyrstond that a knyght goodly shuld not fyll hyme in the brothe of\r\nveleny, ffor leche as veleny may not suffre ientylnesse, on the same\r\nwyse ientylnes in hym self may not suffre velany, anamely not to stryve\r\nne make debate wyth a persone vilens of condicions, ne to speke\r\noutrageously. Platon seith he that ioyneth to his ientylnes nobilnesse\r\nof goode condicions is to prayse and he that holdyth hym content with\r\nthe ientylnes that comyth of his kyne withowtyn addyng thereto some\r\ngoode condicions shulde not be holdyn nobyll.\r\n\r\nBe the carles that become frosshes we may vndyrstonde the synne of\r\ncovetyse, the which is contrary to the good sperit. For Seynt\r\nAustyn[241] seith that a couetous man is leche to hell, for hell cannot\r\nswolve so many sowlis to seye that he hathe inowe. Euen so, thow all\r\ntresowre of the worlde were heppid togedir to the possession of the\r\ncouetous man, he shuld not yette [be] satisffiede. To this purpose the\r\nScripture seith, [“Insatiabilis oculus cupidi in partes iniquitatis non\r\nsatiabitur”].[242]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XXI.\r\n\r\n        Acorde for no thyng with the god Bachus,\r\n        For his tachys[243] be bothe fowle and vicyous.\r\n        His disportis be neyther goode ne fyne,\r\n        For he maketh the pepyll turne to swyne.\r\n\r\nBachus was the man that fryst plantyde vines in Grece, and qwan thei of\r\nthe cuntre felthe the streyngth of the wyne, þe which made thyme\r\ndrownkyn, thei seide that Bachus was a god, the which hadde yovyn syche\r\nstreynghte to his plante. By Bachus is vndirstond drwnkkynnes, as that\r\nthe whiche is a full vnbehouely thyng to all noble men and to a man that\r\nwolde vse reson. And to this purpose Ypocras[244] seyth that\r\nsuperfluites of vynes and metes distroyith body, sowle and vertues.\r\n\r\nBe the god Bachus we may vndirstond the synne off glotenye, ffor the\r\nwhich the good spyryt shuld kepe hym. Seynt Grigory seyth in his\r\nMorralles[245] that, qwan the vice of glotenye hathe the maystry of a\r\nperson, he lesseth all the good that he hath doone; for, qwenne the bely\r\nis not restreynyd by abstynence, all vertues ben drouned togedir. And\r\ntherefor Seynt Poule seith, [“Quorum finis interitus, quorum deus venter\r\nest,” etc.][246]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XXII.\r\n\r\n        Pimaliones ymage for to fele,\r\n        Iff that thou be wyse, sette þerby no deele, [Sidenote: f. 24.]\r\n        For of siche an ymage so wele wroght\r\n        The beaute thereof is to dere bought.\r\n\r\nPymalion was a ful sotyl workeman in makyng of ymages, and a ffable\r\nseith þat, for þe grete lewdenes that he sawe in the women of\r\nCidonie,[247] he dispreisyd them and seyde he shuld make an ymage\r\nwherein ther shulde be no thyng for to blame. He mad an ymage after a\r\nwoman, of souereyne beaute. When he had full made it, loue, the which\r\nsotely can ravysshe hertis, made hym to be amorous opon the ymage, so\r\nthat for hire he was vexed with wooes of love, full of clamorous and\r\nfull of petyous syghynges that he made to hit. Butte the ymage, which\r\nwas of ston, vndirstode hym notte. Pymalion wente to the temple of Venus\r\nand he made there so deuote prayores to hyre that the godesse [was full]\r\nof pete,[248] and in shewyng therof the brond that she helde be hire\r\nselfe began to take fire and shew flame, and than the louer was mery for\r\nþat tokyn and wente toward his ymage and toke it in his armes and warmed\r\nit so sore wyth hys nakyd flesch that the ymage hadde lyff and began to\r\nspeke, and so Pymalyon recouuered ioye.\r\n\r\nTo this fable may be set [many][249] exposicions, and in leche wise to\r\nothir sich fables; and the poietes made them becawse that mennes\r\nvndirstondyng shuld be the more scharppe and subtyle to fynde dyueres\r\nexposicions. It may be vnderstond also by the dyspreysyng that Pymalion\r\ndispreysed the lewdenes of lewde wemen and enamoured hym on a mayden of\r\nryght grete beaute, the which wolde not, or myght not, vnderstond hys\r\npetous pleyntes, no more than the ymage of a ston had done; that is to\r\nsey, that by thynkkyng on the fayre beautes he was enamoured, but at the\r\nlast he prayed hir so myche and kepte hym so nere hir that the maydyn\r\nlouyd hym and at his wille [he] had hir to mariage. And thus the ymage\r\nthat was hard as stone recouuered lyff by the godesse Venus. So it wolde\r\nbe seyde that the good knygh shuld not be assottede of sych a made ymage\r\nin sych wise that he lyst to folowe[250] the crafte of armes, to the\r\nwhich he is bownde by þe ordere of knyghthode. And to this purpose seyth\r\nAbtalin,[251] “It longghit nothyng ffor a prynce to assote hym on\r\nnothyng that is to be reproued.”\r\n\r\nPymaliones ymage on qwome þe good knygh shuld not be assotted we shall\r\ntake for the synne of lechery, from þe which þe knyghtly gostly sperit\r\nshuld kepe his body. Wherefor Seynt [Sidenote: f. 25.] Jerom saith in a\r\npistill, “O fire of hell,” seith he, “of whom the woode is glotenye, the\r\nflambe is pride, the sparkes is foule wordes, the smoke is evil name,\r\nthe asches is pouerte, and the ende is the turnementes of hell.” To this\r\npurpose seyth Seynt Petir the apostel, [“Voluptatem existimantes diei\r\ndelicias, coinquinationes et maculæ deliciis affluentes, in conviviis\r\nsuis luxuriantes”].[252]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XXIII.\r\n\r\n        Off Dyane remenbre besely\r\n        For the honeste of thi body;\r\n        For hir plesyth no vileyns lyffe,\r\n        Ne non dyshoneste ne stryffe.\r\n\r\nDyane, that is the mone, and as þer is no thyng so evile but þat it hath\r\nsome goode propirte, the mone gyffeth chast condicion; and thei named it\r\nafter a lady that so was called, the which was full chaste and was euer\r\na vergyn. So it wolde be seyde that honeste of the body is full wele\r\nlonggyng to a good knygh. And to this purpose Hermes seith, “He may not\r\nbe off perfyte wite that hathe in hym no chastite.”\r\n\r\nAnd for to bryng to mynde the Articles of the Feyth to owre purpose,\r\nwythowte the which a good sperit may lytell avayle, ffor Dyane we shall\r\ntake God of Heuen, the which is withowte onv spotte off onclen love, to\r\nwhome a thyng foulede with synne may not be agreable. To the knyghly\r\nspirite þan it is necessari to beleve opon the Maker of heuen and of\r\nerthe, as þe fyrst Article of the Feyth seith, the which Seynte Petir\r\nthe apostel sete, [“Credo in Deum Patrem Omnipotentem, creatorem cœli et\r\nterræ”].[253]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XXIV.\r\n\r\n        Be thou leke to the godesse Ceres,\r\n        That tooke fro noon but yafe to corne encres;\r\n        In syche wyse abaundonede shulde be\r\n        The[254] good knygh, well sette in his degre.\r\n\r\nCeres was a lady that fond the craft to erye[255] the londe, for aforne\r\ngaineyers swe withowte laboure[256]; and because þat þe londe bare the\r\nmore plenteously after þat it was erryed, thei seide that she was\r\ngodesse of cornes, and thei called the londe after hyr name. Wherefor it\r\nwold be seide þat, as þe lande[257] is habaundone[d] and a large yefer\r\nof all goodes, on the same wyse shuld a good knygh be habaundonede to\r\nall personys and [ought] to gyffe his helpe and comfort aftyr hys power.\r\nAnd Arystotyl seyth, “Be a lyberall gyfer and thou shall hau frendys.”\r\n\r\nHere [for] Ceres, to whom þe good knygh shuld resemble, we [Sidenote: f.\r\n26.] shall take the Sone of God, whom the good spirit sholde folowe, þe\r\nwhich hath yoven so largely to vs of hy goodnes,[258] and in hym shuld\r\nbe belewede stedeffastly, as the .ii.^o Article seith, the which Seynt\r\nJon sette, [“Et in Ihesum Christum, filium eius unicum, Dominum\r\nnostrum”].\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XXV.\r\n\r\n        All hye vertues as that he wyll sette,\r\n        In the, as in Ysis[259] late theyme b[e] schette\r\n        And all maner graynes fructifie;\r\n        In sych wyse sholdest þou edyfye.[260]\r\n\r\nYsys, poetes seyth, is a goodesse of plantes and gryffes, and she yevyth\r\ntheyme streynght and growyng to multiply. Therefor it is seide to þe\r\ngood knyght þat so shulde he fructifie in all vertues and eschew all\r\neuyl vicis. And Harmes[261] to this purpose seyth, “O man, yf þou knew\r\nþe inconuenyency of vice, that þou woldest be ware þeroff and yf þou\r\nknew the rewarde for worthinesse, that[262] þou woldest loue it gretly.”\r\n\r\nThere qwere it is seide þat þe good knygh shulde be leche to Ysys, the\r\nwhiche is a planter, may we vnderstond the blissyd Concepcion off Jhesu\r\nCryst by þe Holy Gost in the Blyssyd Virgyne Marie, modyr off all grace,\r\nof whom the grete bountes may not be ymagenede ne holy seide, þe which\r\nworthi Concepcion the good sperit shuld haue holy in hym and kepe this\r\nholy Artecle stedefastly, as Seynt James the gretter seith, [“Qui\r\nconceptus est de Spiritu Sancto, natus ex Maria virgine”].\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XXVI.\r\n\r\n        To the iugement in no wyse holde the\r\n        Of Mygdas, the which no thyng wysely\r\n        Juged; by his counsell sette thou no store,\r\n        For erys of an asse he hadde thereffore.\r\n\r\nMydas was a knyght[263] that hadde lytell vnderstondyng; and a fable\r\nseyth þat Phebus and Pan,[264] the god of pastures,[265] strove togedir\r\nand Phebus seide that the sownde of the harpe is more to prayse than the\r\nsownde of the pype or off the flowte. Pan heelde the contrarye and seide\r\nþe sownde of the flowte was more to prayse. Thei made Mygdas iuge off\r\nthat discorde, and affter that thei were both ioyned afore Mygdas, at\r\nlong leyser he iuged that the sownde of þe flowte was bettyr and more\r\nplesaunte than þe sownde of the [Sidenote: f. 27.] harpe. So the fable\r\nseith þat Phebus, the which was g[r]evyd [and] hadde dyspyte off his\r\niugement, made hym rude erys leche an asse, in schewyng that he hadde\r\nvnderstondyng of an asse, the which hade iuged so folyly. It may be\r\nallso that some iuged lewdely ayens a prince or a myghty man, the whiche\r\npunychyd hym, makyng hym to bere on hym some syngne off a ffoole, the\r\nwhich is to vnderstond the eres of the asse. Also it is to vnderstond by\r\nthis fable that a good knyght shuld not hold hym content with a lewde\r\niugement, not grownded on reson, ne hym selfe shuld be no iuge of so\r\nfawty a sentence. A philosopher seyth to this purpose that a foole is\r\nleche a molle,[266] the which heryth and vnderstondyth not. And Dyogenes\r\nlykenyth the foole to a ston.\r\n\r\nThe iugement of Mygdas, the which a good knight shulde not kepe, we may\r\nvnderstond Pylate, the which iuged the blyssyd Sone of God to be taken\r\nand streyned as a harpe and to be hangged opon the gebet of þe Crosse as\r\na bryboure,[267] he the which was pure wyth[out] ony spotte. Also it is\r\nto vnderstond þat þe goode speryt shulde be ware how he shulde iuge an\r\ninnocent, and he shulde beleve the Artycle that Seynt Andrewe seith,\r\n[“Passus sub Poncio Pylato, crucifixus, mortuus et sepultus”].\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XXVII.\r\n\r\n        As trewe felawes of armes doth,\r\n        Vnto hell, whedir that sowles gothe,\r\n        Thou schuldest go, theyme to socoure serteyne\r\n        In nede,[268] lich Hercules dyde, as men seyne.\r\n\r\nThe fable seith that Thesus and Protheus[269] went into hell for to\r\nrescue Proserpyne þat Pluto rauysshed, and thei hade ben evyle begone\r\nhade not Hercules a ben for there felawes; [for thei][270] hade not bene\r\nsocoured hade he ne be, the which dyde so notable dedes of armes that he\r\naffrayed all the peple off hell, and he smote in soundir Cereberus the\r\nporteris chynnes.[271] So it is seyde þat a good knygh shulde not faile\r\nhis felawe for no maner of perell that myght be; for trewe felaws shuld\r\nbe evyn as on thyng and all on. And Pitagoras seyth, “Thou shuld kepe\r\nthe loue of thi freende dylygently.”\r\n\r\nBy the auctorite that seith he shulde socoure his trwe freendis in armes\r\nvnto hell we may vnderstonde the blyssyd sowle of Jhesu Cryste, the\r\nwhich drewe owte the good sowles of holy patriarkes and profhetes þat\r\nwere in lymbo; and be this example the goode sperite [Sidenote: f. 28.]\r\nscholde draw to hym all vertues and beleve the Article that Seynt Phelip\r\nseith, [“Descendit ad inferna”].\r\n\r\n\r\n                                XXVIII.\r\n\r\n        Cadimus[272] love and yife to hym preisyng,\r\n        And that auctorised may his techyng\r\n        Be in the; for the welle in serteyne\r\n        He whan[273] fro the serpent with grete peyne.\r\n\r\nCadimus was a full noble man and ffounded Thebes, the which was a cite\r\nof grete name. He sette þerin a vniuersyte[274] and hym selph was gretly\r\nlettyrd and of grete kunnyng and wysdom. The whiche man, after that the\r\nfabyl seith, he dowted þe serpent at the welle. This is to vnderstond\r\nkonnyng and wisdom, the which rysyth all weye, that is for the welle;\r\nthe serpent is notyd for the peyne and the trauell that a stodier most\r\ndoute or that he gete kunnyng. And the fable seithe that he become a\r\nserpent hym selfe, the which is to vndirstond that he become mayster and\r\ncorrectore of othir. So Othea seith that a good knygh shulde love and\r\nworchip clerkes that be letteryd, þe which be growndyd in konnyng. To\r\nthis purpose Aristotle seide to Alysawndre, “Worchip wisdom and fortyfie\r\nit wyth good maystres.”\r\n\r\nBe Cadimus that douted the serpent at þe well, þe whiche þe good knygh\r\nshuld love, we may vnderstond the blyssed manhode of Jhesu Cryste, the\r\nwhich douted the serpent and wanne the welle, þat is to sey, the lyfe of\r\nthis worlde, þe which he passed with grete peyne and with grete\r\ntrauelle, off whom he hade victorie be strengh, when he rose the thredde\r\nday, as Seynt Thomas seith, [“Tertia die resurrexit a mortuis”].\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XXIX.\r\n\r\n        Delyte gretly in the kunnyng\r\n        Of Yo more than good or othir thyng[275];\r\n        For by that thou mayst lerne full gretly\r\n        And of good theryng take largely.[276]\r\n\r\nYo was a yong ientilwoman and doughter to knyng Ynacus;[277] þe which\r\nwas rygh konnyng and fond many maners of letteris þat hade not be se\r\nafore. Though that some fables sey þat Yo was Jupiteris love and þat\r\nsche becam a kowe and after a woman as she was, [this was not so], but,\r\nas the poietis hathe hyde trowth vnder couerture of fable, it may be þat\r\nJubiter lovid hire, þat is to vndirstond by the vertues þe which was in\r\nhere[278] she become a kowe, for, as a kowe yevith mylke, the which is\r\nswete and norisshyng, she be the letteris that she fonde gaffe\r\nnorysshyng to [Sidenote: f. 29.] vnderstondyng. And in that she was a\r\ncomon woman may be vndirstond that here wytte was comon to all, as\r\nlettris be comon to all peple. Þerfore it is seide þat þe good knygh\r\nshuld full mych love Yo,[279] þe which may be vnderstondyn þe letteris\r\nand scriptures and stories of good peple, þe which þe good knygh shold\r\nhire telle gladely and reede þe example of, þe which may be vailable to\r\nhym. To this purpos Hermes seith, “Who so enforceth hyme to gete konyng\r\nand goode condicions, he fyndith þat þe which shall plese hym in this\r\nworlde and in the tothir.”\r\n\r\nYo, the which is noted for letteris and scriptures, may be vnderstondyn\r\nþat þe good sperit shuld delyte hym to reede or to here Holy Writte and\r\nnot[280] þe Scriptures in his mynde, and thereby may he lerne to clyme\r\nto hevyn with Jhesu Cryst by good werkys and holy contemplacion and\r\nshuld beleve the worethi Article that Seynt Bertylmw seith, [“Ascendit\r\nad cœlos, sedet ad dexteram Dei Patris Omnipotentis”].\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XXX.\r\n\r\n        Beware in whatte place so that it be\r\n        In the noyse of flowtes slepe not ye;\r\n        For Mercurius that softe syngeth\r\n        With his flowte þe peple enchaunteth.\r\n\r\nA ffabill seyth þat, when Jubiter louede fayre Yo, Juno had hym gretly\r\nin suspeccion and discendid from heven in a skye[281] for to take hire\r\nhusbonde whit[282] the dede. But qwhan Jubiter sawe hir come, he\r\nchawnged his love to a cowe; yit for all that Juno was [not] owt of\r\nsuspeccion, but askyd hym þe cowe of yifte, and Jubiter ayens his lyst\r\ngrauntyd [it] to hyr, as he þat dryst not ayens say hire for doute of\r\nsuspeccion. Þan Juno gaffe Argus, þe which hade .c. yen, this cow to\r\nkepe, and euer he wchid[283] it. But the god Mercurius by þe\r\ncommaundement of Jubiter toke his flowte, þe which song softly, and blew\r\nso longe in Argus eyre þat all his .c. eyne were aslepe. Than he smote\r\nof hys hede and toke the cowe.\r\n\r\nThe exposicion of this fable may be as þat some myghthi man loved a\r\ngentilwoman; than his wyf tooke to hire for to make wache on hir\r\nhusbonde þat he disseyvyd hire not, and þeropon sette grete weches and\r\nclere seers, þe which may be noted for Argus eyne. But þe louer by a\r\nperson malicius and well spekyng dide so miche þat þe kepers concentyd\r\nto gyf hym hys love, and thus were thei browght aslepe by Mercurius\r\nflowte and hade there hedes smyttyn off. There[fore] it is seyde to þe\r\ngood knyght þat he shulde not suffre [himself] to be brought on slepe\r\nwith non swiche flovte as to be robbed of that þe which he shuld kepe.\r\nAnd to this purpos Hermes seith, “Kepe thou fro þo that is gouuernede be\r\nmalice.”\r\n\r\nBe Mercurius flovte we may vnderstond þat þe goode sperit be [Sidenote:\r\nf. 30.] not disseyvid by þe hold enemy trowe[284] ony mysbeleve of þe\r\nfeyth or othir wyse than he shuld beleue stedefastly þe Article þat\r\nSeynt Matheu þe Euangelist seith, þat God shall come and iuge þe qweke\r\nand the dede, where he seith, [“Inde venturus iudicare vivos et\r\nmortuos”].\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XXXI.\r\n\r\n        Thinketh that Pirus[285] shalle resemble\r\n        His fadire and that he shal trobyle\r\n        His enemyis and put theyme to distres;\r\n        The deth he shall venge for Achilles.\r\n\r\nPyrus was Achilles sone and resembled full wele his ffadir in streyngh\r\nand hardines, and after the deth of his fadyr he come to Troye and full\r\ncharply venged his fadir and hurte grettly the Troyens. Therefor it is\r\nseide to the good knyght þat, yf he have myssedone to the ffadir, lete\r\nhym be ware of the sone, when he comyth to age, and, yf the fadir be\r\nworthi or manly, þe sone shulde be þe same. The wise[286] man seith to\r\nthis purpose that the fadris dethe asketh the sone þe vengaunce þerfore.\r\n\r\nThere where he seith þat Pirus shulde be lech his fader, by þat we may\r\nvnderstond the Holy Gost, the which procedyth of the Fadir, in whome the\r\ngood sperit shulde beleve, as Seynt James þe lesse seith, [“Credo in\r\nSpiritum Sanctum”].\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XXXII.\r\n\r\n        Haunt thow the temple and worchip in tyme\r\n        The godesse[287] of heven, and at all tyme\r\n        Aftir Cassaundra kepe thow the gyse,\r\n        Yif þat þou wilt be holdyn for wyse.\r\n\r\nCassandra was Kyng Priantes doghtere, and she was a full good lady and a\r\ndevoute in there lawe.

Therefor it is seide to þe good knygh þat he shulde be\r\nleke hir, for lewde costomes and lesynges ys gretly to blame in a knyte;\r\nfor he shulde serue God and worchip the temple, þat is to sey, the\r\nchirche and the ministres thereof. And Pictagoras seith, “It is a ryght\r\nloveable thyng to serue God and to halowe hys seyntes.”[288]\r\n\r\nThe a[u]ctorite seyth þat þe good knygh shulde haunte the [Sidenote: f.\r\n31.] temple. In leche wyse the goode sperit shuld do, and he shulde haue\r\nsynguler deuocion in the feythefull holy chirche and in the communion of\r\nseyntes, as the Article seyth that Seynt Symond made, the which seyth,\r\n[“Sanctam ecclesiam catholicam, sanctorum communionem”].\r\n\r\n\r\n                                XXXIII.\r\n\r\n        Yf þou wylt often haunt the se,\r\n        Of Neptunus thou shuld ofte remenbre the,\r\n        And thou shuldest halow gretly his feste,\r\n        That he may kepe the euer fro tempest.\r\n\r\nNeptunus opon the paynemes lawe was called þe god of þe see, and\r\ntherefor it is seyde to the good knygh þat he shuld serue hym, þat is to\r\nvndirstond þat knyghttes, the which gosh often in many viages on the se\r\nor in other diueres perelles, haue more nede to be devoute and to serue\r\nGod and his seyntens than othir peplyl, to the entente [þat] at here\r\nnede he may be socourable and helpy to theyme.

To this purpose Hermes seyth,\r\n“Be glader to dye withowte cawse than to do a inconuenyence.”\r\n\r\nWe schall come now to declare the Commawndementis off the Feyth, and\r\nthere too we shall take an allegorie to oure purpose.\r\n\r\nBerolophon, the which was so full of trowthe, may be noted for God of\r\nHeuen and, as his hy mercy hath ben to vs, and is, full of all trouth,\r\nwe may take the Fryst Commawndement, the which seith, “Thou shalt\r\nworchip no strawnge goddes.” To this seith Seynt Austyn that the\r\nworchippe the which is called latre[294] thou shulde not do it, neythir\r\nto ydoile ne to ymage ne to no lekenes of no maner of creature, for that\r\nis a dew worchyppe all only to God, and in this Commawndement is\r\ndefendede all ydolatrie.

And that shewed wele; ffor when Achilles\r\nhade sleyn hym by treson, Maymons wonded Achilles sore and [wolde haue]\r\nsleyne[297] hym, hade not socoure acome to hym in hast. Therefor it is\r\nseide to the goode knygh þat he shulde loue hym and socoure hym at his\r\nnede; and this is to vnderstonde that euery prince and goode knygh which\r\nhath kyne, be thei neuer so lytell or poore, so he be goode and\r\ntrwe,[298] he shulde loue hym and support hym in his dedes and en\r\nspecyall whene he felyth hym trewe to hym.

And Seynte\r\nGregorie seyth in his Omelies þat, lech as the lyffe of the body may\r\nnotte be susteyned withowte that he take his refeccion bodyly, on the\r\nsame wyse þe lyfe of the soule may not be [Sidenote: f. 36] susteined\r\nwithowte ofte heryng the good worde of God.[321] Than Godes wordes the\r\nwhich ye here[322] with youre bodely heris reseyue them in yowre hertis;\r\nfor, whan the word is hed and kepte in yowre wombe of mynde, than it may\r\nprofyte, but, as a seke stomak castyth owt his mete, and as men be in\r\ndispayre of hym that brokyth notte but casti[t]h all owte, euen so his\r\nhe in perell of euerlastyng dethe þat heryth prechyng and doth not\r\nþerafter.

Hue of Seynt Victore seith to this purpose that\r\nþe mouth þe which hathe not the kepyng of discrecion farith as a cete\r\nthat is withoute a walle, as a vessell that hathe no bothom,[327] as an\r\nhorse that hath no brydel, and as a chippe þat hath no rothir.

And to this purpose Dauid seith in the Sawter booke,\r\n[“Prohibe linguam tuam a malo, et labia tua ne loquantur dolum”].[329]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  LII.\r\n\r\n        Beleue the Crow and his true counsell,\r\n        And be neuer besy ne trauele\r\n        In evil thyngges to be þe berer;\r\n        Off thi deme thou mayst be þe suerer.[330]\r\n\r\nThe fable seith that the crowe mette þe ravyn when he browte the\r\ntidynges to Phebus of his loue Corinis, þe which hade done [Sidenote: f.\r\n37.] amysse, and she[331] requiryd of hym so ferre þat he tolde hyr[332]\r\nthe cawse of this iurneye. But[333] she dissalowed hyme because he went\r\nnot for to gyffe hym example of the same, the which for a lych cas hade\r\nben chassede owte of the pallas howse, where some [time] [s]he was wonte\r\nto be gretly avanced. But he wolde not beleue hyr, for þe which harme\r\nfolowed to hym. Where it is seyde to þe good knyght þat he shulde trost\r\nþe crowe; and Platon seith, “Be no iangeler ne to the knyng grete\r\nreportur of tydynges.”\r\n\r\nHow the crowe shulde be beleued, it is seide that the goode speryte\r\nshulde vse sych counsell. As Seynt Grigorie seith in his Omelies, þat\r\nstrenght vailet not when counsel is not, ffor streynght is sone\r\nouerthrowyn, iffe it be not rested opon the gyfte of counsell, and the\r\nsoule þe whych hath lost in hym the seege of counsell outewarde he is\r\ndysparbuled[334] in diuerse desires. Therefor the wyse man seyth, [“Si\r\nintraverit sapientia cor tuum, consilium custodiet te et prudentia\r\nservabit te”].[335]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 LIII.\r\n\r\n        Iff thou enforce the with[336] any wyght\r\n        Strenger than thou to make playes of myghte,\r\n        Withdrawe the fayre þat hurte thou ne be;\r\n        Off Ganymedes vmbethynk the.\r\n\r\nGanymedes[337] was a yong ientilman of the Troyens ligne; and a fable\r\nseith þat Phebus and he strof togedir in castyng of a barre of yron,\r\nand, as Ganymedes myth not withstond the strenght of Phebus, he was\r\nslayne wyth þe reboundyng of þe barre Phebus hade lawnchyd so hye that\r\nhe had lost þe syght þerof. And þerfor it is seyde that þe stryffe is\r\nnot goode with a strenger and a myghtier than a man is hym selfe, ffor\r\nther may not cumme thereof but grete inconuenyencie. Where a wyse man\r\nseith, “To be besy with men þat vse vngracious games, it is a syngne of\r\npride, and communly the ende is angry.”\r\n\r\nFore to sey that a man shuld not enforce hym ayens a streynger þan he is\r\nhym selfe, it is to vndirstond that the goode sperite shulde not take on\r\nhym to stronge pennawnce withowte counsell. Seynt Grigori in his\r\nMoralles spekyth hereof and seyth þat penawnce profytteth not, yf it be\r\nnot discrete, ne the vertue of abstynens is not worthe, yf it be sette\r\nin sych wyse that it be scharper than the body may suffre. And þerfor it\r\nis to conclude þat no poore person shulde take it on hym withowte\r\ncounsel off more discrete than hym selfe. Where the wyse man seyth in\r\nhis Prouerbes, [“Ubi multa consilia, ibi est salus”].[338]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  LIV.\r\n\r\n        Resemble not to Jasone, that man [Sidenote: f. 38.]\r\n        The which throuȝ Medee þe fleze wan\r\n        Off golde, for þe which soon afterwarde\r\n        He yafe hire right evill guerdon and harde.\r\n\r\nJason was a knyght of Grece, þe which went into strawnge cuntreis, that\r\nis to sey, into the Ile of Colcos, by the enortyng off his vncle\r\nPelleus, the which of envy desired his deth. There was a chepe[339] þat\r\nhadde a flees of golde and it was kepte by enchauntment; but the\r\nconquest was so strong that non comme thedir but that lost there lyfe.\r\nMedee, the whiche was the kynges doughter of that cuntre, toke so grete\r\nloue to Jason þat by the enchauntmentes that sche cowde, off the which\r\nsche was a soueren maysteres, she made charmes and lerned Jason\r\nenchauntementis by the whiche he whanne the fleese of golde, wereby he\r\nhade worchip aboue all knyttes lyvynge, and by Medee was reserued fro\r\ndeth, to whom he hade promysyd euer to be trwe freende. But efftyr he\r\nfayled of hys feyth and loued anothir and left hyr holy[340] and forsoke\r\nhir, notwithstondyng she was off soueren beaute. Therfor it is seyde to\r\nthe good knyght that he shulde not be leke to Jason, the which was\r\nvnknowyn and to ontrwe to þat the which hade schewed hym mych\r\ngoodenes.[341] Wherefor it is to veleyns a thyng for a knyght or any\r\nnobill person to be rekeles or evyll knowyng of goodenesse, iff any he\r\nhath reseyuyd, be it of lady or off gentylwoman or off ony othir\r\npersone; ffor he shulde euere thynke thereon and guerdon it vnto his\r\npowere. To this purpose Hermes seith, “Be not slowe ne delayyng to\r\nremembre of hym þat hath doone the goode, for thou shuldest euer thynkke\r\nthereopon.”\r\n\r\nThe good sperite shulde not be leke to Jason, the which was rekeles, ne\r\nvncunnyng of the benefices reseyvid of his Maker. And Seynt Barnarde\r\nseith opon the Cantecles that vnkunnyng is ennemye to the soule, a\r\nlesser of vertues and dispraysyng of meritis and a lessyng of beneficis,\r\nand allso ingratitude fareth as nowght,[342] the which dryeth the well\r\nof pete, the dewe of grace and the reuer of mercye. And to this purpose\r\nthe wyse man seith, [“Ingrati enim spes tanquam hibernalis glacies\r\ntabescet et disperiet tanquam aqua supervacua.”][343]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  LV.\r\n\r\n        Kepe the wele fro the serpent Gorgon; [Sidenote: f. 39.]\r\n        Be ware that thou looke not hyr[344] opon;\r\n        Haue good sadde mynde opon Percyualle,[345]\r\n        And he shall the tell the story all.\r\n\r\nGorgon, as the fable seith, was a gentylvoman of souereyne beaute; but\r\nbecause that Phebus[346] lay by hyr in the temple of Diane, the godes\r\nwas so sore meved and grevyd that she schawnged hir into a serpent of\r\nryght orribil figure. And þat serpent hade sich a propirte þat euery man\r\nthat [be]helde hir was changed sodeynely into a ston; and for the harme\r\nthat folwed of hire Percyvale, the worthi knyght, went for to fyght with\r\nthat fers beste. And he behelde hym selfe in the bryghtnes of his\r\nshelde, the whiche was all golde, because he shulde not beholde the\r\nevill serpent, and he dide so mych þat he smote of hir[347] hede. Many\r\nexposicions may be made of this fable, and Gorgon may be vndirstonden\r\nfor a cete or a towne þat was wonte to be of grete bounte, but throw the\r\nvicis of the duellers þerin it become a serpent and venemus; that is to\r\nvnderstonde, þat it dede mych harme in the marches to there neygburs, as\r\nto robbe and to pyll holy chirche,[348] all tho þat thei myghte gete,\r\nand merchawndys and othir passeris forby were takyn and holden and put\r\nin streyte presonys and thus were thei chawnged into stones. Percivale,\r\nthat behelde hym selfe in his chelde, þat is to sey, in his strynght and\r\nknyghode, and went to fyght ayens the cite, he tooke it and tooke the\r\npower fro it, þat it dede no more harme.[349] It myght be that some man\r\nmyght take a full feyre lady of evyll dedys, þe which bi hire couetise\r\nput many from there goodes, but he put hir from þat wyll; and many othir\r\nvndirstondynges may be sette herein. Therefor it is seide to þe good\r\nknyght that he kepe hym fro behaldyng evill thyngges, þe which myght\r\ndrawe hym to evyll. And Aristotil seith, “Fle peple full of wikydnes and\r\nbefolowe wyse men and stody in there bookes and beholde thy selfe in\r\ntheire dedes.”\r\n\r\nHow that Gorgon shulde notte be beholden, þat is to sey þat þe good\r\nsperite shuld not behold no thyng in no maner delyte, but beholde[350]\r\nhym in þe childe[351] of þe state of perfeccion, and þat is for to fle\r\ndelites. Aristotyl[352] seithe þat, as it is impossibyl þat [fire shuld\r\nburn in water, so it is impossibyl þat] compunccion[353] of herte is\r\namong wor[l]dly delites, for thei be .ii^o. contrary thynges þat\r\ndistroyith iche of them othir, for compunccion is modir of terres and\r\ndelites engenderyth laughynges, compunccion restreynyth the [Sidenote:\r\nf. 40.] hert and delites enlargeth it.

Jon Cassian[370] seith that in no wyse the edifice of vertues in\r\noure sowle may not reyse ne dresse hym self if the fundement of very\r\nmekenes be not tastyd fryst in oure hertes, the which, and it be ryghte\r\nstedefastly sette, may susteyne þe lynes of perfeccion and of charite.\r\nTherefor the wyse man seyth, [“Quanto maior es humilia te ipsum in\r\nomnibus et coram Deo invenies gratiam”].[371]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 LVIII.\r\n\r\n        Thy witte to be ennorted[372] suffre nought\r\n        To foly delitys, ne herto brought\r\n        Thy wyrchip; if it be asked of the,\r\n        Anon beholde the wele in Medee.\r\n\r\nMedee was on of the konnyngest women of sorserye that euer [Sidenote: f.\r\n42.] was and hade most kunnyng; and þat stories seith.

Wherefor\r\nOthea seith that the good knyght shulde not suffre reson to be ouercome\r\nwyth lewde delyte in no maner cas, iff he will vse of the vertue of\r\nstreynght. And Platon seyth that a man of lyghte corage is sone\r\nmeved[373] wyth that the which he louede.\r\n\r\nThat a man shulde not suffre his wytte to be ennorted to lewde delyte\r\nmay be vnderstondyn that the goode sperit shulde not suffre his propir\r\nwill to haue dominacion; for, yf propir will of dominacion cesyd not,\r\nthere shulde be noon hell ne the fyer off hell shuld haue no dominacion\r\nbut opon the person that sufferyth his propir will to be lorde of hym,\r\nffor propir will feythyt ayens God and enprideth the selfe. That is the\r\nwhich dispoilleth Paradyse and clothit hell and voydeth the valu of the\r\nblode of Cryst Jhesu and submyttyth the worlde to the tharledom of the\r\nfeend. To this purpose the wyse man seyth, [“Virga atque correptio\r\ntribuit sapientiam; puer autem qui dimittitur voluntati suæ confundit\r\nmatrem suam.”][374]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  LIX.\r\n\r\n        Iff thou be soget to god Cupido,\r\n        The wood[375] giant looke thou kepe the fro,\r\n        That the harde roche in no wyse may put be\r\n        Opon Acis and opon Galatee.[376]\r\n\r\nGalatee was a fayre godesse, the which had a yong ientilman that she\r\nloued and he was dede.[377] There was a gyant of a fowle stature that\r\nloued hir, but she lyste not to loue hym; but he aspied hir so besily\r\nthat he perceyued theyme bothe in the creues of a roche. Thanne were\r\nthey ouerleyde[378] with a sodeyne rage, and the roche trembled in syche\r\nwyse that it holy brak and raffe asownedyr. But Galatee, the which was a\r\nfayrye,[379] dressyd hir into the see[380] and askapid therby. This is\r\nto vndirstond that the good knyght shulde be ware in sich case to be\r\nouerleyde with sich as hath myght and wyll to greve hym.\r\n\r\nHow he shuld be ware of the gyant, the which is yoven to Cupido, itt is\r\nto vnderstond that the good speryte [shuld] be wele ware that he hath\r\nnon ymagenacion to the worlde ne to no thynge [Sidenote: f. 43.] þerof,\r\nbut euer thynke that all woordly thynges may litell while endure. For\r\nSeynt Jerom seyth opon Jeremye that there is no thyng may be noysed long\r\nemong those thynges which shalle haue ende; so all owre tyme is as of\r\nlitell regarde to the euerlastyng terme. To this purpose the wyse man\r\nseyth, [“Transierunt omnia illa tanquam umbra et tanquam nuntius\r\npercurrens”].[381]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  LX.\r\n\r\n        Fleeth euer the godesse of Dyscorde;\r\n        Euyl be hire lyenis and hire corde.\r\n        Pellus[382] mariage full sore she trobled,\r\n        For the which after mych foolke assembled.\r\n\r\nDyscorde is a godesse of evil dedys, and a fabyll seyth that whan Pellus\r\nweddyd the godesse Thetis, off whome Achilles was after that borne,\r\nJubiter and all the tothir godes and godesses were at the mariage, but\r\nthe godes of Discorde was not prayed therto and therefor for invie she\r\ncom onsent for. But she come not all for noghte, for she dide verily hir\r\noffice. When they were sette at dynne at a borde, the .iii. myghty\r\ngodesses Pallas, Juno and Venus, there come Discorde and cast an appell\r\nof golde opon the borde, whereon was wretyn “Lete this be gouen to the\r\nffayrest”; and than the fest was trobeld, for yche off theyme sey thei\r\nought to haue it. They went afore Jubiter for to be iuged of that\r\ndiscorde, but he wolde not plese on to displese anothir. Wherefore thei\r\nputte the debate opon Paaris of Troye,[383] the [which] was an herde man\r\nthan,[384] as his modir drempt, when sche was grete with hyme, that he\r\nschulde be cawse off distruccion of Troye; he was sent therfor to the\r\nforest to the herdeman, venyng[385] to hym that he hadde bene his sone.\r\nAnd there Mercurius, the wiche [conducted] the ladies,[386] tolde hym\r\nwhos sone that he was; than he lefte kepyng of shepe and went to Troye\r\nto his grete kynne. The fabill witneschit thus, where the weri stori is\r\nhidde vndir poyetikly couertoure, and because that often tymes many\r\ngrete mischevis hath fallen and fallyth throwe discorde and debate,\r\nOthea seith to the goode knyth that he shulde be ware of discorde; so\r\nthat, as it is a fowle thyng to be a debatoure and to move riottes,\r\nPitagoras seith “Go not,” seith he, “in that weye where that hattes[387]\r\ngrowes.”\r\n\r\nWhere it is seyde that discorde shuld be fleed, on the same wyse the\r\ngood sperit shulde flee all lettynges of consience and [Sidenote: f.\r\n44.] eschewe stryvis and riottes. [Cassiodorus][388] souuerainly seith,\r\n“He fleeth stryves and riottes; for to stryve ayens pes it is woodnes,\r\nto stryue ayens his souereyne it is maddenes, to stryve ayens his\r\nsoogette it is grete velany.” Therefor Seynte Powle seith, [“Non in\r\ncontentione et æmulatione”].[389]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  LXI.\r\n\r\n        Thyne evyll misdede forgete thou noght,\r\n        Iff thou to any[390] haue so myche wroughte,\r\n        For the reward he will wele kepe fro the.\r\n        Distroyed was Leomedon, parde.\r\n\r\nLeomedon, as I haue seide, was kyng off Troye, and he hadde done grete\r\nvelany to the barons of Grece[391] to voyde them fro his lande[392]; the\r\nwiche they foryate noght, but Leomedon hathe foryeten it whan the Grekes\r\nron on hym, the wiche ouercome hym, he oncouered and disporveide, so\r\nthey distroyyd hym. Therefor it is seide to the good knyght that, yf he\r\nhathe mysdone to any, that he kepe hym wele, ffor he may be sekyr it\r\nshal notte be foryeten, but rather wenged,[393] whanne he may haue tyme\r\nand place. And to this purpose Hermes seyth, “Be ware that thynne\r\nennemyes com not vpon the, and thou disporveyde.”\r\n\r\nThat he shuld not forgete the myssedede that he hathe done to anothir\r\nmay be vndirstondyn þat, when the good sperite felyth hym in synne for\r\nfawte of resistence, he shulde thynke that he shuld be ponnysshede, as\r\nthei be that be dampnyd, yf he amende hym notte. And therof seith Seynt\r\nGregorie that the dome of God goth nowe fair and softely and a sclowe\r\npas, but in tyme comyng it shall recompence the more greuously the mercy\r\nshall tarry of his acte. To this purpose the prophete Joel seith,\r\n[“Convertimini ad Dominum Deum vestrum, quia benignus et misericors\r\nest,” etc.].[394]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 LXII.\r\n\r\n        Iff it happe thou be of loue doited,[395]\r\n        Be ware at the leste to whom thou tell it;\r\n        That thi dedes discouered not be,\r\n        Vmbethynke the welle of Semelle.[396]\r\n\r\nThe fable seith that Semelle was a gentylwoman that Jubiter loved\r\nparamours. Juno, the wiche was in ialoucie, tooke the lekenes of an\r\nauncient woman and cam to Semelle and with fayre wordys began to reson\r\nhyre in so moche that Semelle knowliged to hyre all the love off hyre\r\nand of hyr loue, and to [be] well beloued and knowen of hyme she vaunted\r\nhire. The godesse þanne seyde to hir, the [Sidenote: f. 45.] wiche tooke\r\nno hede of the dissayte, [that] she perceyued[397] nothyng yit of the\r\nlove of hire love, [but] when she shulde be nexte with hym, that she\r\nshulde aske hym a yifte and, when she hadde well requyred hym and that\r\nhe hadde grawnted, that she shulde desyre of hym that he wolde\r\nvouchesafe to halse[398] hir in syche wyse as [he] halsed Juno his\r\nwyffe, when that he wolde solace hym with here, and in syche wyse myght\r\nshe perceyue the loue of hyre love. Semelle fforyate it not, and when\r\nshe hade made the requeste to Jubiter, the wiche hade promysyd it hyre\r\nand as a god that myght not calle it agayne, he was full sori and wyst\r\nwele that sche hadde bene disseyved. Than Jubiter tooke lekenes of\r\nfire[399] and halsed his loue, the wiche in a litell while was all\r\nbruled and brent, for the wiche Jubiter was full hevy of þat aventure.\r\nOpon this fabill may be takyn many vnderstondynges, anamly opon the\r\nscience off astronomie, as maystris seyne. But it may be allso that be\r\nsome weye a gentilwoman may be disseyved by the wyffe of hyr loue,\r\nwherethrowgh hym selfe made hir to die be inaduertance. And therfor it\r\nis seyde to the good knyght that he shuld be ware, whanne he spekyth of\r\na thyng that he wolde that it were secrete, afore or he speke hys worde,\r\nto whome he seyth it and whatte he seyth, for by the circumstances\r\nthyngges ma ben vndirstondyn. Therefor Hermes seith, “Shewe not the\r\nsecretes of thi thoughtes but to thoo that thou hast well preued.”\r\n\r\nHow he shulde take hede to whome he spekyth we may vndirstond that the\r\ngood sperite, what so euer hys thowtys be, he shulde be ware in euery\r\ncas where evil suspeccion myght falle to ony othir. As Seynt Austyn\r\nseith in the booke of Job,[400] that we shuld not all only sete store to\r\nhaue good conscience, but in as myche as owre infirmyte may, and as\r\nmyche [as] the diligence of mankyndly frelnes may, wee shuld take good\r\nhede that we dede no thyng that myght come to evil suspeccion to owre\r\nstedefast brothir.[401] To this purpose seith Seynt Poule the apostle,\r\n[“In omnibus præbe te ipsum exemplum bonorum operum”].[402]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 LXIII.\r\n\r\n        The disporte trust not to mychyll opon\r\n        Of Dyane, for þer is disporte right none\r\n        For them þat ben in knyghthode pursewyng\r\n        That shuld cause them to haunt to mych huntyng.\r\n\r\nDyane is called godess off the wode and of huntyng; so it is seide to\r\nthe good knyght pursewyng the hight name of armes þat he shulde not mvse\r\nto myche in the disportes of huntyng, for it is a [Sidenote: f. 46.]\r\nthyng that longeth to ydylnes. And Arystotle seith that ydilnes ledyth a\r\nman to all inconveniences.\r\n\r\nThat a man shuld not folwe to myche Dyanes disporte, the wiche is take\r\nfor ydilnes, the goode speryte may noote the same, and that is to\r\neschew. Seynt Grygori seyth, “Do euer some goode thynge, that the fende\r\nmay allway fynde the occupied in some goode occupacion.” To this purpose\r\nthe wyse man seith, [“Consideravit semitas domus suæ et panem otiosa non\r\ncomedit”].[403]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 LXIV.\r\n\r\n        Avaunte the not, for grete harme fell therefore[404]\r\n        To Yragnes,[405] the wich myssetook hir sore,\r\n        That ayens Pallas hire so avaunted,\r\n        For the wyche the goodesse hire enchaunted.\r\n\r\nThe fable seyth that Yragnes was a gentylwoman full sotyll and kunnyng\r\nin schapyng, wevyng and sewyng, but she was too presumtuos of hir\r\nconnyng and indede she vaunted hire ayens Pallas. For the wyche the\r\ngodes was greued wyth here that fore that foly vauntyng sche schawneged\r\nhyr into an yraigne and than seyde, “Thou vaunted the so myche in wevyng\r\nand sewyng that thou shalt euer aftir this weve and spynne werke of no\r\nvalue,” and fro thiens come the yraignes that be yite, the wiche sessyth\r\nnot of spynnyng and wevyng. It may be so vndirstonden that some persone\r\nwanted ayens hir maystres, ffor the wiche in some wyse thei tooke harme.\r\nTherefor it is seide to the good knyght that he shuld not vaunt hyme,\r\nstandyng it is a foule thyng for a knyght to be a vauntoure, for it may\r\nabuse to myche the prayse of his bownte. And in the same wyse Platon\r\nseyth, “When thou dost a t[h]yng,” seith he,[406] “better than anothir,\r\nbe ware thou avaunte not therof, for yf thou doo thyne avayle is myche\r\nthe lesse.”\r\n\r\nFor that a man shuld not vaunte hym, we may sey that the goode sperite\r\nshulde be ware of wauntyng, for Seynt Austyn spekith ayens vauntyng in\r\nthe .xii. boke of the Cete of God, þat vauntyng is not mankyndly\r\npraysyng, but is aturnyd to vyse of the sovle, the wich louyth mankyndly\r\npraysynges and dispithet the wery wytnes of his propyr consyence. To\r\nthis purpose the wyse man seythe, [“Quid nobis profuit superbia, aut\r\ndiuitiarum jactantia?”].[407]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  LXV.\r\n\r\n        Iff to grete desyre will them brynge\r\n        To loue mechell disporte of huntynge,\r\n        Dadonius[408] than remenbre may the,\r\n        For with a woode wilde bore dede was he.\r\n\r\nDadanius was a ioly gentylman[409] and of grete beaute. Venus loued hym\r\nparamoures, but because he delytyd hym to myche in huntyng, Venus, the\r\nwich douted that some hurt myth com to hym by some aventure, she prayed\r\nhym ofte to be ware how he huntyd to grete bestes. But Dadonius wolde\r\nnot be ware, and therfor he was slayne wyth a wilde bore. Therfor it is\r\nseyde to the good knyght that, yf he wille all gates hunte, late [hym]\r\nkepe hym from sych huntyng that may doo hym harme. To this purpose the\r\nprofete Sedechias[410] seith that a knyght shulde not suffre his sone\r\nhunte to myche ne be ydyll, but he shulde make hym to be enformed to\r\ngoode condicions and to fle vanyte.\r\n\r\nHow he shulde thynke on Dadonius may be vnderstondyn that, yif the goode\r\nsperite be in any wyse out off the weye, that at the leste he shulde\r\nthynke on the grete perell of perseuerance; for, as the fende hath grete\r\nmyght opon synners, Seynt Petir seythe in the secund Pystyll[411] that\r\nsynners ben bownde to corupcion and the fende hath power ouer theyme,\r\nfor he that in batayle is ouercome of an othir is becomyn bonde to hym.\r\nAnd in tokyn therof it is seyde in the Pocalipse, [“Data est bestiæ\r\npotestas in omnem tribum et populum.”][412]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 LXVI.\r\n\r\n        If so be thette there assaile the any,\r\n        Be ware thou ne thi men ryse not lyghtly\r\n        Ayens theyme, that thi town of strenght not slake;\r\n        Off the fryst Troye example thou mayst take.\r\n\r\nWhenne Hercules wyth mych pepyll com opon the fryst Troye and that kyng\r\nLeomedon herd seye of there comyng, than he with all the peple that he\r\nmyght gete in the cete yode owte and went ayens theyme to the water\r\nsyde, and there theye assembled wyth full ferse bataile and þe cete was\r\nleft voyde of peple. Than Thelamen Ayaux, the wich was enbushed wyth a\r\ngrete oste nere the walles of the cete, enteryd into it, and thus the\r\nfryst Troye was takyn. Therefor it is seyde to the goode knyght that he\r\nshulde kepe hym, that in siche wyse he be not disseyuyd wyth his\r\n[Sidenote: f. 48.] ennemyes. And Hermes seyth, “Kepe the from the\r\npeple[413] of thyn ennemyes.”\r\n\r\nWhere it is seyde that a man shuld kepe hym, yf he be assayled, that his\r\ncete be not voide, it is to sey that the good spyryte shulde euer kepe\r\nhym sesid and filled with vertues. And hereto seyth Seynt Austyn that,\r\nlyche as in tyme of werre men of armes shuld not be onsesyde of theyre\r\narmes ne owt of theyme nyght ner day, on the same wyse duryng the tyme\r\nof this present lyfe he shulde not be dyspoyled of vertues, for he thate\r\nthe fende fyndeth withowte vertues faryth as he that the aduersari\r\nfyndyth withoute armes. Therfor the Gospel seyth, [“Fortis armatus\r\ncustodit atrium suum”].[414]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 LXVII.\r\n\r\n        Opon the harpe assot the not to sore\r\n        Off Orpheus. Yf thou sete any store\r\n        Be armes, thou wylte þerin wele spede.\r\n        To fre[415] instrementis thou hast non nede.\r\n\r\nOrpheus was a poyete, and the fabill seyth that he cowde welle pleye on\r\nthe harrpe, so that the ryngyng[416] wateres all only tournyd theyre\r\ncoruse, and the birdes of the eyre, the wylde bestes and the fres[417]\r\nserpentis foryate there cruelnes and restyd to here the songge and the\r\nswete sounde of his harpe. This is to vnderstond he pleyith so wele that\r\nall maner of pepill of whate condicions that they were delytede theyme\r\nto here the poietis pley. And becawse that syche instrumentis sotted\r\noften the hertis of men, it is seyde to the goode knyght that he shuld\r\nnot delyte hym to meche therein, for it longeth not to the sones of\r\nknyghthode to mvse to mych in instrumentis ne in othir ydylnes. To this\r\npurpose an auctorite seyth, “The soule of the instrument is the snare of\r\nthe serpent”; and Platon seyth, “He þat settyth holy his plesauns of\r\nfleysly delythes is more bond þan a sclawe,” that is to seye, than a man\r\nthat is bought and solde.\r\n\r\nOrpheus harpe, vpon the wich a man shulde not be assotted, we may\r\nvndirstonde that the knyghtly sperite shulde not be assotted ne mvsyd in\r\nno maner of wordly felacheppe, be it kynne or othir. Seynt Austyn seyth\r\nin the booke of the Syngularyte off Clerkis that the solytary man felyth\r\nlesse prekynges of his fleych that havntyth not voluptuousenes than he\r\nthat hawntyth it, and lesse it [Sidenote: f. 49.] sterith to couetyse\r\nthe which seeth not wordly riches[418] than he that seeth it. Therefor\r\nDauyd seith, [“Vigilavi et factus sum sicut passer solitarius in\r\ntecto”].[419]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                LXVIII.\r\n\r\n        Grownde yow not opon noone avysyons,\r\n        Ne opon no lewde illusyons\r\n        Off grete emprise, thought it be ryght or wrong,\r\n        And of Paaris remenbre yow among.\r\n\r\nBecause that Paryis hadde dremed that he shulde ravysch Helayne in\r\nGrece, a grete army was made and sent ffro Troye into Grece, where that\r\nParyis ravysshede Heleyne. Than for that wrongfull dede they com after\r\nthat opon Troye with all the power off Grece. There was soo grete a\r\ncovnetre at that tyme that it lastyd to the contre that we calle now\r\nPuille[420] and Calebre in Ytaly, and that tyme it was called Lytyl\r\nGrece.[421] And of that contre was Achilles and þe Mirmedewes, the which\r\nwere so worthi fyters. That grete quantite of pepill confoundid Troye\r\nand all the contre. Therefor it is seyde to the good knyght that he\r\nshulde not ondirtake to doo no grete thynge opon avysiones, for grete\r\nharme and grete besynes may come thereoff. And that a grete emprise\r\nshuld not be done wythowte good deliberacion of counsell, Platon seyth,\r\n“Do nothyng,” seith he, “but that thy wytte hath ouerseen afore.”\r\n\r\nThat a grete empryse shuld not be takyn for avisyon, that is to sey that\r\nthe good sperite shulde in no vyse presume ne reyse hym selphe in\r\narrogance for no maner of grace that God hath yoven hym. And Seynt\r\nGregorie seyth in his Morales that there be .iiii. spices[422] in the\r\nwhiche all bolnynges of arrogances be shewed. The fryst is when they\r\nnoyse they haue of them selfe the goodnes that they haue; the .ii. is\r\nwhen they wene welle that they haue deseruyd and reseyuyd it for ther\r\nmeritis the goodnes þat they haue; the .iii. is when they avant to haue\r\nthe goodnes that they haue not; and the .iiii. is when that they\r\ndysprese othir and desire that men shuld know the goo[d]nes that is in\r\ntheyme. Ayens this vyse the wyse man spekyth in his Prouerbes,\r\n[“Arrogantiam et superbiam et os bilingue detestor”].[423]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 LXIX.\r\n\r\n        Iff thou loue well houndes an birdes, than\r\n        On Anteon,[424] the fayre yong gentilman,\r\n        The which becomme an herte, vmbethynk well þe,\r\n        And loke that siche fortune com not to the.\r\n\r\nAntheon was a full corteis ientylman and of gentyl condicions [Sidenote:\r\nf. 50.] and loued houndes and birdes to myche; fore the fabill seith\r\nthat on a day as he huntyd all alone in a thykke forest, wheryn his men\r\nhadde lost hym, thane as Dyane the godesse of the woode hadde huntyd in\r\nthe forest to it was the oure of noone, she was sore chaffede and hoote\r\nfor the grete hete of the sunne, for þe which she had a lyste to bathe\r\nhir in a f[a]yre welle and a clere, the whiche was ther fast by, and as\r\nshe was in the welle all nakyde envyrouned wyth fayreis[425] and godes\r\nthe whiche seruyd hyre, Antheon, the which tooke non heede, com sodeynly\r\nopon hire and sawe all the godes, of whome for hire grete castite the\r\nvesage wexe reede for shame and was full sory. And than she seide,\r\n“Becawse that I know wele that thysse yong gentilman wyll vaunt hym of\r\nladies and gentilwomen—to the entent that thou schalte not mowe vante\r\nthe that hathe see me naked, I shall take the myght of thy speche from\r\nthe.” Than she cursyd hym, and anon Antheon becomme a wilde herte and no\r\nthyng was lefte hym of mankyndly shape but all only vndirstondyng. Than\r\nhe, full of grete sorowe and off sodeyne feere, wente fleyng throwe the\r\nbusches, and anon he was reseyuyd with his owen houndes and halewed wyth\r\nhys owen men that serched the forest for hym, but nowe they haue founde\r\nhyme and knowe hym not. There Antheon was drawe doune, the whych wepte\r\ngrete teres afore his owne men and fayne woolde haue cryed theyme mercy\r\nyif he myght haue spokyn. And sene that tyme hethir to hertes euer at\r\nthere dethe wepyn. Antheon was slayne and martired with grete woo with\r\nhis owen menye, the which in a litell while had all devowred hym. Many\r\nexposicions may be made vpon this fable; but to oure purpose it may be\r\nseide of a yong man that habaundoneth hym holy in ydylnes and dispendith\r\nhis goodes and his gettynges in delyte off his body and in disportes of\r\nhuntyng and to kepe ydel menye. Hereby may it be seide that he was hated\r\nof Dyane, the which is noted for chastite, and deuowred of his owen\r\nmenye. Therefor it is seide to the good knyght that he shuld be ware he\r\nwere not deuowred in leche wyse. And a wyse man seith, “Idilnes\r\nengendyrth idylnes[426] and errour.”\r\n\r\nBe Antheon, the which become an herte, we may vnderstond the veray\r\nrepentaunt man that was wonnte to be a synner and now hath ouercome his\r\nfleyssch and made it bonde to the good sperite [and] takyn the state of\r\npennaunce. Seynt Austyn seith in the Sawtyr that pennance is an esy\r\nthyng or dede and a lyght charge; it owght not to be called a grete\r\ncharge for a man but wenges off a byrde fleyng, for, as a birde in herth\r\nhere bereth the charge of [Sidenote: f. 51.] there wenges and there\r\nwenges berith theyme to heven, on the same wyse, yff we bere on erthe\r\nhere the charge off pennawnce, it shal bere vs to heven. To this purpose\r\nþe Gospell seith, [“Pœnitentiam agite, appropinquavit enim regnum\r\ncœlorum”].[427]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  LXX.\r\n\r\n        I seye go notte to the yates of helle\r\n        For to seke Euridice be my counselle.\r\n        Litell he wanne there with his harpe and play,\r\n        Orpheus, as that I haue ofte herd seye.\r\n\r\nOrpheus the poyete, the which harpede so well,[428] a fabil seith that\r\nhe maried hym to Euridice, but on the day of mariage thei wente to\r\ndisporte theyme in a medwe barefoote ffor the grete hete of the sonne,\r\nand an herde coveytyd that fayyr woman and ranne ffor to a rauysshed\r\nhyr, and as she flede afore hym for fere of hym she was betyn with a\r\nserpent that was hyd wnder the gresse of the medwe, and within a litell\r\nwhile after the mayden dyed. Orpheus was ryght heuy of that mysse\r\naventure; yit he tooke his harpe and wentte to þe yattes of helle in the\r\ndyrke waly afore the helle paleys, and thanne he begane to harppe\r\npytously and he pleyyd so swetely that all the tormentes off helle cesyd\r\nand all the helly offices lefte there besynes for to here the sownde of\r\nthe harppe, and anamly Proserpyne, the godes off helle, was meuyd with\r\ngrete pete. Than Pluto, Lucifere, Cerebrus and Acaron,[429] the which\r\nfor the harpor sawe that the offices off hell peynnes lefte and cesed,\r\ntoke hym hys wyff vpon a condicion that he shulde goo afore and sche\r\nafter, and that he shulde notte loke behynde hym to he come owt of the\r\nvaly of helle, and yff he looked behynde hym he shuld lefe hire. Opon\r\nthis condicion she was delyuered to hym ayen. So Orpheus wente afore and\r\nhis loue after, but he that was to hoote in loue, the which desired to\r\nbeholde hire, myght not kepe hym from lokyng ayen after his loue, and\r\nanoon as [he] loked byhynd hym Euredice partyd from hyme and was ayen in\r\nhelle, so that he myght no more haue hire. This fable may be\r\nvndyrstondyn in many maneres. It myght be so that some man had his wyff\r\ntakyn fro hyme and he had getten hire ayen; on the same wyse it may be\r\nof a castell or of anothir thyng. But to owre purpose it may be seide\r\nthat he seketh veryly Euredice in hell, the which sekyth an inpossibyl\r\nthyng and, thowgh a man may notte recouer that, he owghte not to be\r\nwrothe. Salamon seyth the same, “It is a foly thyng,” he seith, “to seke\r\nthat the which is impossybylle to be hadde.” [Sidenote: f. 52.]\r\n\r\nBe that a man shulde not goo to seke Euredice in hell, we may vndirstond\r\nthat the goode speryte shulde aske ne requyre of God no thyng that is\r\nmeruellious,[430] ne that mervell to be thyng oon, that is to sey, to\r\ntempte God. And Seynt Austyn seith opon Seynt John Gospell that Godes\r\ncreature is not exavced when he requiryth a thyng the which may not be\r\ndoone or shuld not be doone, or a thyng the which he wolde vse amysse yf\r\nthat it were grawntyd hyme, or ell a thyng that shuld hurte the sowle yf\r\nit were exauuced. And therfor it comyth of the mercy off God, if he gyff\r\nnot to a creature a thyng the which he knowyth he wolde vse amysse. To\r\nthis purpose Seynt James the apostell seyth in his Pistell, [“Petitis et\r\nnon accipitis eo quod male petatis”].[431]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 LXXI.\r\n\r\n        Iff thou will veraly knowe a knyght\r\n        In cloystir or clos where he be dyght,\r\n        The say[432] that was made to Achilles\r\n        Sall lerne the to proue theym doutles.\r\n\r\nThe fable seith that Achilles was sone to the godes Thetis, and becawse\r\nthat, as a godes, she knew if hir sone haunted armes that he shu[l]d\r\ndye, she, the which louyd hym with to grete love, hide hym in maydinis\r\nclothyng and made hyme were a vaile leche a nonne. In the godesse\r\nabbay[433] he lyffed so, and Achilles was long hydde vnto that some\r\npersones perseyuyd hym, and the fabill seith that there he begate\r\nPirus[434] opon the kynges dougther, the which was after that full\r\ncheualerous. Than began the Troyens grete werres, and the Grekes knew\r\nwele that thei hadde nede of Achilles for to streynght theyme. He was\r\nsowte ouer all, but thei myght not here of hym. Vlixes, the which was\r\nfull of grete malice, sowgth hym ouer all [and] come to the temple, but\r\nyit he myght not perseyue the trowght. He avysyd hym of grete malice and\r\nsotilte, and than Vlixes toke keuercheffes, girdill and all maner of\r\niowell[435] longyng to ladies and therwith feyre armure and bryghte and\r\ncast all doune in the myddes of the place in presens of the ladyes and\r\npraide iche of theyme to take[436] that the which plessede theyme best;\r\nand than, as euery thyng drawith to his nature, the ladies ronne to the\r\njowell and Achilles sessede the armure. And thanne Vlixes ranne and\r\ntooke hyme in his armys and seyde, “This is he that I seke.” And becawse\r\nthat knyghtes shulde be more inclyned to armes than to plesawnce,[437]\r\nwhich longgeth to ladies, the auctorite seith that therby a man may\r\nknowe the veray knyght. And to this purpose Legaron[438] seith that a\r\nknyghte is not [Sidenote: f. 53.] knowen but be his dedes of armes.[439]\r\nAnd Hermes seith that thou shuldest preue a man afore or that thou trost\r\nhym to gretely.\r\n\r\nWhere it is seyde, “Yf thou wylte knowe a goode knyght,” we may\r\nvnderstondyn that the good knyght [of] Cryst Jhesu shuld be know by the\r\ndede of armes in goode workyng, and that siche a knyght shulde haue the\r\ndwe prayse that longgeth to goode men. Seynt Jerom seith in a pistil\r\nthat, as the ryghtvisnes of God levyth non evil thyng vnponysshede, on\r\nthe same wyse it levith no goode thyng vnrewarded. So than to good\r\npepill noo labour shulde be thought to harde, ne no tyme to longe,\r\nstandyng that thei [are] abydyng[440] the euerlastyng hire and blys.\r\nTherfor Holy Scripture seith, [“Confortamini et non dissolvantur manus\r\nvestræ, erit enim merces operi vestro”].[441]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 LXXII.\r\n\r\n        Wyth Athalenta stryue thou not nowe,\r\n        For she hath gretter talent þan thou.\r\n        It was hir crafte for to renne fast.\r\n        To siche a rennyng haue thou non hast.\r\n\r\nAthalenta was on of the fayre[442] and lyche to a gentilvoman of grete\r\nbeaute, but hire destonye was diuerse; ffor because of hire mony lost\r\nther lyves. This gentilvoman for hire grete beaute was covetyde of mony\r\noon to be hadde to maryage, but ther was made sich a conuenawnt that non\r\nshulde haue hire but he ouerranne hir, and yf she ouerranne hym, he\r\nshuld dye. Athalenta was mervelious swyft, so that non myght streche to\r\nhir in rennyng and that cawsed many on for to die. This rennyng may be\r\nvnderstondyn in many maneres. It may be as some thyng that is gretly\r\ncovetyid of many persones, but yit it may notte be hadde withowte grete\r\ntraueyle; the rennyng that she made is the defence or the resistence of\r\nthe same thynges. And allso the fabill may be noted anamly for tho that\r\nmakyth grete stryve and nedith not. Also the auctorite seyth that a hard\r\nman and a coragius ought not to myche to stryve for onprofytabyll\r\nthynges, the whiche he shulde not set by, stondyng that thei\r\n[t]owche[443] not to his worchyppe for many grete [h]urtes folwyth off\r\nsich stryues. And Thessille[444] [se]ith, “Thou shuldest doo that the\r\nwhich is moste [pro]fetable to the body and most behouely to the soule\r\nand fle the contrarye.”\r\n\r\nThat we shulde notte stryve wyth Athalenta may be vnderstondyn that the\r\ngoode speryte shulde not be letted with non thyng [Sidenote: f. 54.]\r\nthat the worlde dothe, of what gouernans it be. And to the same Seynt\r\nAustyn seyth in a pistil that the worlde is more perlious to creaturis\r\nwhen it is eesy than whan it is sharpe, for the softer he seeth it the\r\nles it shulde lete hym and lees he shulde drawe it to his love then\r\nwhenne it yeffyth hym cause to dispite it. To this purpose Seynt John\r\nthe Euaungelist seyth in his fryst Pistill, [“Si quis diligit mundum,\r\nnon est charitas Patris in eo”].[445]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                LXXIII.\r\n\r\n        As that Paris iugede iuge thou noght,\r\n        For many men hau ben full hard brought\r\n        Be grauntyng of evil sentence\r\n        And had þerfor ryght greuous recompence.\r\n\r\nThe fable seith that .iii. godesses of grete myght, that is to sey,\r\nPallas godes of kunnyng,[446] Juno godes of goode,[447] and Venus godes\r\noff love, com before Paris holdyng an apple of golde,[448] the which\r\nseide, “Lete this be youen to the fayrest and the myghttyest of vs.”\r\nThere was grete discord ffor this appyll, for iche of theyme seyde they\r\nought to haue it, and at the last thei tooke Paris for to iuge the\r\ncavse. Paris sought delegently the strenghte and the myghte of ich of\r\ntheyme by the selfe. Than seide Pallas, “I am godes of cheualry and of\r\nwysdom, for by me armes is departed to knyghtes and konyng to clerkes,\r\nand yf thou wilt yiff me the appyll, tryst veryli that I shall make the\r\nto paase[449] all othir in koonyng and in knytehode.” After that Juno,\r\ngodes of goode, seide, “And by me is departyd the grete lordshippes and\r\nalso tresowrys off the worlde. If thou wyl gyff me the appyll, I shall\r\nmake the recher and mygh[t]ier than ony othir.” And than spake Venus\r\nwyth full louyng wordes and seide, “I am she that kepyth scoles of loue\r\nand off iolines[450] and maketh fooles to be wyse men and wyse men to do\r\nfoly, and I make ryche men poore and tho þat be exiled riche. There is\r\nno myght that may compare wyth my myght. Iff thou wylt yeffve me the\r\nappyll, by me thou shalt haue þe love of fayre Helaine of Grece, the\r\nwhich may avayle the more than any maner of ryches.” And thanne Paris\r\ngaff his sentence and forsoke bothe knyghthode, wisdom and riches for\r\nVenus, to whome he gaff the appyll; for the which after that Troye was\r\ndystryd. This is to vnderstonde, because that Paris was not cheuallrous\r\nne reche, he sette be noo thyng, but all his thought was on loue, and\r\ntherefor yaffe he the appill to Venus. Werefor it is seide to the goode\r\nknyght that he shuld not demene hym so. And Pictagoras seith, [Sidenote:\r\nf. 55.] “The iuge that iugede not iustyly, diserveth myche evyll.”\r\n\r\nBe Parys that iuged folely is vnderstonden that the goode sperite shulde\r\nbe ware how he iuged oþer. Seynt Austyn spekyth thereoff ayens the\r\n[Manichees][451] that there be .ii. thynges the whych in especiall we\r\nshulde eschewe, fryst to iuge othir persones, for we know not of what\r\ncorage thynges be done, the which to contempne it is þerfor[452] grete\r\npresumcion, for we shuld take theyme to the better partye; secundly for\r\nbecause we be not incerteyne what the[i] shall be that now be goode or\r\nnow evill. Owre Lord to this purpose seith in þe Gospell, [“Nolite\r\njudicare et non judicabimini, in quo enim judicio judicaveritis\r\njudicabimini.”][453]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 LXXIV.\r\n\r\n        In Fortvne, that grete myghty godesse,\r\n        Trist not to mych, ne in hyre promyse;\r\n        For in a lytell space she chaungeth,\r\n        And the hyest ofte ouerthroweth.\r\n\r\nFortune aftyr the spekyng off poyetis may be wele called the grete\r\ngodes, for by hire we see that wordly thynges be gouernde. And becauce\r\nshe promysyth to many prosperite inowght—and indede to some she yeffeth\r\nit—and in litell space takyth it awaye when it plesyth hire, it is seide\r\nto the goode knyght that he shuld not trost in hire promysses ne\r\ndiscomfort hym not in his aduersites. And Socrates seith the cours of\r\nfortvne farith as engins.[454]\r\n\r\nBecavse whi that he seith that he shulde not trost in fortvne, we may\r\nvnderstond that the good spirite shuld fle and disprayse wordly\r\ndelittes. Therefor Boys[455] seith in the .iii. booke of Consolacion\r\nthat the felicite off the Epicuriens shulde be called vnfelicite, for\r\nthe full and the perfyȝth felicite it is that the which [can] make man\r\nsufficiently myghty, reuerende, solempne and ioyeux, the which\r\ncondicions resiste not to thynges whereopon wordly peple settyth there\r\nfelycite.[456] Thereffor God seyth by the profyte Ysaie, [“Popule meus,\r\nqui te beatum dicunt, ipsi te decipiunt”].[457]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 LXXV.\r\n\r\n        To vndirtake to avance werre, [Sidenote: f. 56.]\r\n        Make thou not Paris the begynner;\r\n        Better he cowde (take vittenes aboue)\r\n        Disporte in the feyre armes of his loue.\r\n\r\nParis was nothyng condicionned to armes, but all to loue. Therefor it is\r\nseide to the goode knyght that he shuld not make a cheuetayne of his\r\nhost ne of his bateilles a knyght the whiche is not apte to armes. And\r\ntherefor Aristotyl seith to Alizaunder, “Thou shuldest make hym\r\nconnestabil of thyne oste that thou knowes is wyse and experte in\r\narmes.”\r\n\r\nThat ye shulde not make Paaris to begynne yowre werres, it is to\r\nvnderstonde that the good knyght gostly, tendyng only to the knyghthode\r\nof heuen, shuld be holly drawen fro the worlde and ches contemplatyue\r\nlyffe. And Seynt Grigore seith vpon Ezeciell that the lyffe\r\ncontemplatyue is of ryght preferred afore the actiue liue as for the\r\nworthier and the gretter, for the actiue life travellith hymselfe in the\r\nlaboure of this present lyfe, but the contemplatyve lyfe farith as he\r\nthat tristith[458] the sauour of the reste that is for to come. Wherefor\r\nthe Gospell seith off Mary Magdalene, be whom contemplacion is figured,\r\n[“Optimam partem elegit sibi Maria, quæ non auseretur ab ea”].[459]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 LXXVI.\r\n\r\n        Sette the not to be a spy, I the seye,\r\n        But loke thou kepe euer the hey weye.\r\n        Sephalus[460] wyth his [s]harpe iaueloth[461]\r\n        Lereth it the, and the wyff of Lothe.\r\n\r\nThe fabill seith that Sephalus was an ancient knyght the which delyted\r\nhym grettely all his lyue in the disporte of huntyng, and he coude cast\r\na darte hade sich a propirte that it was neuer cast in veyne, but it\r\nkyllyd all þat it tovched. And because that he hade a costome to ryse in\r\nthe mornyng and to goo to the forest to aspye the wylde bestis, his wyff\r\nwas ielous ouer hyme and supposed that he loued othir than hire, and for\r\nto know the trowthe she went after to aspy hym. Sephalus, the which was\r\nin the woode, when he herde the leues make noyse where that his wyff\r\nwent, supposed that it hadde ben some wylde best, kest his iauelot and\r\nkyllyd his wyff. He was hevy of that mysse aventure, but there myght no\r\nremedy be hadde. The woman Lothes wyffe, as that Holy Scripture\r\nwytnessyth, turnyd ayen ayens the commawndment off the aungell, when she\r\nherde that the .v. cetees sanke behynde hyr, and therfor anon she was\r\nchawnged into a [Sidenote: f. 57.] salte ston. And be all sich figures\r\nmay be sette many vndirstondynges. For the trwthe and for to take it in\r\nexample for the trowthe, no good man shulde delyte hym to spye anothir\r\nin thynges that longeth not to hym; and to the entend that no man wolde\r\nbe aspyed, Hermes seith, “Do not to thi felawe that the which thou\r\nwoldyst not were done to the, and strech no snaris for to take men\r\nwythall, ne purches noon harme to theyme be aspyeng ne be wyles, for at\r\nthe last it will turne opon þiselfe.”\r\n\r\nThat a man shulde not sette hym for to spye may be vndirstondyn that the\r\ngood sperite shuld not peyne hym to knowe othir mennis dedes, ne to\r\nenqwere tydyngges of othir. For Seynt John Crisostome seith opon the\r\nGospell of Seynt Mathieu, “Howe takys thow so grete hede,” seith he, “of\r\nso many litell defawtes of othir men and latyst pase so many grete\r\ndefawtes in thyn owyn dedes? Yf thou loued thi selfe better than thi\r\nneyghburght, whi empechest thou his dedes and leuys thyne owyn? Be\r\ndiligent to considir thin owyn dedes fryst, and than consider the dedes\r\noff othir.” To this purpose owre Lorde seith in the Gospelle, [“Quid\r\nautem vides festucam in oculo fratris tui, trabem autem in oculo tuo non\r\nvides?”].[462]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                LXXVII.\r\n\r\n        Disprayse not of Helene the councell;\r\n        I counsel the so wythowte fayle,\r\n        For ofte many hurtes falleth then,\r\n        Because that we beleue not wyse men.\r\n\r\nHelene was brothir to Hector and Kyng Priantes sone of Troye. He was a\r\nfull wyse clerke and full off konyng. As mych as he myght, he counseyled\r\nthat Paarys shulde not goo into Grece to rauyssh Helayne; but thei wolde\r\nnot do aftyr hym, for the which the Troyens were hurte. Therefor it is\r\nseide to the good knyght that he shuld beleue wyse men and there\r\ncouncell, and Hermes seith, “Who so worchyppyth wyse men and vsyth there\r\ncouncell, thei be euerlestyng pepyll.”\r\n\r\nHelene, the which counselled ayens the werre, that is to sey that the\r\ngoode sperite shulde eschwe temptacions. And Seynt Jerom seith that a\r\nsynner hath noon excusacion whereby he howght to suffyr temptacions to\r\nouercome hym, for the temptyng feend is so febill that he may ouercome\r\nnoon but thoo that wyll be yolden to hyme. And thereopon Seynt Povle the\r\napostyl seyth, [“Fidelis [Sidenote: f. 58.] Deus qui non patietur vos\r\ntemptari supra id quod potestis,” etc.].[463]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                LXXVIII.\r\n\r\n        Be not to mery ne to sori\r\n        For thi dremes, though thei be hevy.\r\n        Morpheus byddyth, the messanger\r\n        Off the god of slepe and dremes seere.[464]\r\n\r\nA ffabill seyth that Morpheus is sone to the god of slepe, and he is his\r\nmassenger and he is god of dremes and cawsyth men to dreme. And because\r\nthat dremes be trobolous thynges and a derke and some tyme it may\r\nsyngnifie contrarie to the dreme, þer is noon so wyse that may propirly\r\nspeke[465] liche as the expositours seith of theyme[466]. Therfor it ys\r\nseide to the good knyght that he shulde not be to heuy ne to mery ffor\r\nsich avysyons, be the which a man may not shewe no certeyne knowlych ne\r\nto what thyng thei sal turne, and anamely þat a man shulde not be to\r\nmery ne to hevy ffor thynges off fortune, the which be transsitorie.\r\nSocrates seith, “Thou that arte a man, thou shuld not be to hevy ne to\r\nmery ffor no maner cawse.”\r\n\r\nWhere it is seide that a man shuld not be to mery ne to hevy for non\r\navysyons, we shall seye that the good speryte shuld not be to heuy ne to\r\nmeri for no maner cause that cometh to hym and that he shuld suffre\r\ntribulacions paciently. Seynt Austyn seith vpon the Savter, “Fayre son,”\r\nseith he, “yf thou wilte wepe for thi sorres that thou felest, veepe\r\nvnder the correccion off thi Fadir; yf thou wepe ffor tribulacions that\r\ncomyth to the, be ware that it be not for indignacion ne for pride, for\r\nthe aduersyte that God sendyth to the it is a medycyne and no payne, it\r\nis a chastisment and no dampnacion. Put not fro the thi Fadris rodde but\r\nyf that þou wylt that [he] put the from his heritage; and thynk not on\r\nthe payne that thow owghtes to suffre of his scorge, but considir what\r\nplace thow haste in his testament.” To this purpose the wyse [man]\r\nseythe, [“Omne quod tibi applicitum fuerit accipe et in dolore sustine,\r\net in humilitate tua patientiam habe.”][467]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 LXXIX.\r\n\r\n        Be the see yf thou wylt vndertake\r\n        Perlyous viages for to make,\r\n        Off Alchion[468] beleue the counsell.\r\n        Ceys therof the soth may the tell.\r\n\r\nCeys was a kyng, a full good man, and loued wele Alchyon [Sidenote: f.\r\n59.] his wyff. The kyng tooke a deuocion ffor to go a perlyows passage\r\non the see in a tempest, but Alchyon his wyffe, the whiche loued hym\r\nryght hertily, dyde gretyly hir besynes to meve hym fro[469] that vyage\r\nand with grete teris of wepyng prayde hyme full besyly; but it myght not\r\nbe remedied by here ne he woold not suffir hir to goo with hym, stondyng\r\nthat she wolde all gates haue gone with hymme and at the departyng she\r\nstyrte on to the shepe.[470] But Ceys the kyng comfortyd hir and with\r\nforce made hyre to abyde, for the which she was full anggwyssous and\r\nhevy and in ryght grete woo. Neuer the lesse Eolus,[471] the god of\r\nwyndes, meved theyme soo gretely opon the see that the kyng Ceys within\r\nfewe dayes perysshed on the see; ffor the which, whenne Alchyon knew\r\nthat aventure, she kest hire selfe into the see. The ffabill seith that\r\nthe godes had pyte þeroff and chawnged the bodyes of the .ii. louers\r\ninto .ii. birdes, to the intent that there grete loue myght be had in\r\nperpetuell mynde. And yette þe same birdes flee opon the see syde, the\r\nwhich be called Alchions and there fedres be whyte; and whan the\r\nmaryneris see theyme come, þan be they sekyr of a tempest.[472] The\r\nryght exposicion hereof may be that in mariage .ii^o. loueres loued\r\ntogedir in lich wyse, the which poyetes lykeneth to the .ii^o. byrdes\r\nthat hade sich a case and aventure. Therefor it is seide to the goode\r\nknyght that he shulde not put hym in no perlyous passage ayens the\r\ncounsell off his good ffrendis. And Assaron[473] seyth that the wyse man\r\nenforseth hym to draw hym fro hurtes, and the foole doth his diligence\r\nto fynde hurtes.\r\n\r\nFor to beleue Alchion, it is to vnderstond that the goode speryte by\r\nsome evil temptacion is empeched with some errowe or dowte in his\r\nthowght, in the which he shuld reporte hym to the openyon off the\r\ncherche. For Seynt Ambrose seyth in the .ii. booke off Offices that he\r\nis fro hym selfe that dispyseth the counsell of the cherche, for Joseph\r\nhelped kyng Pharaon more profitably with the cownsell off his prudence\r\nthan though he had yoven hyme eythir gold or syluer; for syluer myȝgh\r\nnot a purueyde for the famyn of Egypte the space of vii. yere. Therefor\r\nit is concluded, “trust counsell and thou shalt not repent the.” To this\r\npurpose the wyse man seith in his Proverbes to the persone of holy\r\nchirch, [“Custodi legem atque consilium et erit vita animæ tuæ”].[474]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 LXXX.\r\n\r\n        Off a chylde beleue notte the counsell,\r\n        For off Troylus remenbre the wele.\r\n        Trest[475] ye may men aged and prouede,\r\n        That in armes hath sore bene charged.\r\n\r\nWhen Kyng Priant had repared Troye ayen, the which was dystroyede\r\nbecause of the greuyng of theym that went into Colcos, [Sidenote: f.\r\n60.] than Priant thought to take vengance for that distraccion and\r\nasemblyd his counsell, where that were many hy barons and wyse men, for\r\nto wete wheythir it were good that Paaris his sone shulde goo into Grece\r\nto ravyssh Elen or noon in achaunge for Esyona[476] his sistir, the\r\nwhich was taken be the Thelomonailles[477] and ledde into thraldom. But\r\nall the wyse men seyde nay, becavse of proficies and of scriptores, the\r\nwhiche seide through that rauysshyng Troye shuld be dystroyed. Than\r\nTroylus, the whiche was a child and the yongest of Priantes sones, seyde\r\nthat men shulde not in counsell of werre beleue olde men ne there\r\nprouerbes, the which threwe[478] there cowardyse counselleth euer to\r\nrest; so he counselled that they shulde goo togedir. Troylus conseil was\r\nholdyn, of the which felle myche harme. Therefor it is seyde to the good\r\nknyght that he shuld not holde ne beleve the counsell of a childe, the\r\nwhich of nature is full lyght and lityll to consydir. An auctorite seith\r\nto this purpose that where a childe is kyng þe londe ys onappy.[479]\r\n\r\nThat a good speryte shulde not agre hym to the counsell of a childe, it\r\nis to vndirstond that he shulde [not] be ignorant, but knowyng and full\r\nlerned in that the which may be prophyte to his helth; ffor ayens\r\nignorant pepyll Seynt Austyn seith, “Ignorance is a full evyl modir, the\r\nwhich hath full evill doughteris, that is to sey, falssenes and doute;\r\nthe fyrst is myschawnce, the secund is wreechednes, the fyrst is\r\nvicyous, but the secund is softer,[480] and these .ii. is drawen away by\r\nwysdome.” Therefor the wyse man seyth, [“Sapientiam prætereuntes non\r\ntantum in hoc lapsi sunt ut ignorarent bona, sed insipientiæ suæ\r\nreliquerunt hominibus memoriam”].[481]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 LXXXI.\r\n\r\n        Hate Calcas and his false disseytes,\r\n        Off whome the infynyte malicis\r\n        Betrayeth many reaumes expres[482];\r\n        Off wordly pepyll þer is no wers.\r\n\r\nCalcas was a sootyl clerke of the cete of Troye,[483] and, whan Kyng\r\nPriante knew that the Grekes come opon hym with a grete oste, he sent\r\nCalcas into Delphos to wete of the god Appolonie[484] how the werre\r\nshulde fortvne. But after that the god hade aunsweryd, the which seide\r\n[that] after .x. yere the Grekes shulde haue the victorie, Calcas turned\r\ntowarde the Grekes and aqwaynttyd hym with Achilles, the which was comme\r\ninto [Sidenote: f. 61.] Delphos for the same cause, and with hym he went\r\nto the Grekes, whome he helpid for to cownsel ayens his owen cete and\r\nofte tymes disturbed the pes betwyne the Grekys and the Troyens. And\r\nbecawse he was a traytore, it is seide to the goode knyghte that he\r\nshulde hate sich evill sotell pepyll, ffor theyre traysones so done be\r\nwilles may hurte gretly reaumes and empires and all maner of pepyll.\r\nTherefor Platon seith, “A soothel[485] enemy, though he be poore and not\r\nmyghty, may greue more than a ennemy myghty and ryche vnknowyn.”\r\n\r\nCalcas, the which shuld be hatyd, may be vnderstonden that the good\r\nsperyte shulde hate all fraudelous malice ayens his neyghburgh, for he\r\nshulde in no wyse consent thertoo. For Seynt Jerom seith that a\r\ntraytoure will not be sowpled, neythir for familiarite off felachep ne\r\nfor homlynes of mete and drynke ne for grace of seruyce ne for plente\r\noff benefices. Off this vice seith Seynt Poule the aposstell, [“Erunt\r\nhomines cupidi, elati, superbi, proditores, tumidi”].[486]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                LXXXII.\r\n\r\n        Be thou notte harde for to graunt, I say,\r\n        Sich a thyng as welle enploy thou may;\r\n        To Hermofrodicus[487] haue tendyyng,[488]\r\n        The whiche tooke harme for his denying.\r\n\r\nHermofrodicus was a beauteous yong thyng, and on of the fayree[489] was\r\nsore enamourede of hymme, but he in no wyse had leste to love hire and\r\nshe purswed hym ouer all. Yt felle on a tyme that the yong thyng was\r\nfull wery of the purswte wherein he hadd trauelled all the day. Than he\r\ncome to a well-spryng sette abovte with salwes,[490] by the whiche was a\r\nfayre stanke, styll and clere, ffor the which a lest he hade to bathe\r\nhym.[491] He dyde of his clothes and went into the water. Whan she off\r\nthe fayree sawe hym onclothyd and all naked, she went in to hym and for\r\ngrete loue tooke that yong thyng in hir armes; but he, the which was\r\nfull froward, put hire fro hym ryght rudely, so she myght not wynne his\r\nhert for no prayour. Than she of the fayree, full of woo, prayde to the\r\ngodes that she myght neuer parte from hire loue, the whiche put hire so\r\nfro hym. The godes of pete harde hire deuoute prayere; than sodanly they\r\nchaunged the .ii^o. bodies into oone, the which were of .ii^o.\r\nseytis.[492] This fabill may be vnderstondyn in many maneres, lich as\r\nsothell clerkes and philosopheris hath hide there grete secretes vndir\r\ncouertoure of fable. Thereto it may be [Sidenote: f. 62.] vnderstondyn\r\nsentence longyng to the science of astronomy, and as wele of\r\nnygromancye,[493] as that maystrys seyth. And because that the matyr of\r\nloue is more delictable to here than othir, gladely[494] they made there\r\ndistinccions[495] opon loue for to be the more delectable to here,\r\nanamly to rude pepill, the whiche take but the barke, and the more\r\nagreable to subtile, the which sowketh the lyquor. But to owre purpose\r\nwe may vndirstond that it is velany and a fowle thyng to refuse or to\r\ngrawnte wyth grete daunger that the which may not turne to vyce ne to\r\npreiudice, thowgh it be grawnttyd. For Hermes seyth, “Make no long delay\r\nto put it in execucion that the which þou shuld doo.”\r\n\r\nThe goode speryte shulde notte be harde to graunt there where he seyth\r\nnecessite, but reconforte the nedy to his power. As Seynt Gregore seith\r\nin his Moralles that, whan we wyll reconforte any that is afrayed in\r\nheuynes, we shulde fryst make heuynes with theyme, for he may not veryly\r\nreconforte the hevy person which cordeth hyme not with his heuines. For\r\nleche a man[496] may not ioyne oon yren to anothir yf thei be note hote\r\nbothe .ii^o. and softyd with the fire, on the same wyse we may not\r\nredresse anothir yif oure hertes be not softted be compassyon. To this\r\npurpose Holy Scripture seith, [“Confortate manus dissolutas et genua\r\ndebilia roborate”].[497]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                LXXXIII.\r\n\r\n        Thou mayst wyth the pleys the solace\r\n        Off Vlixes, when thou hast tyme and space\r\n        In the tyme of trwes and of fest,\r\n        For they be both sotel and honest.\r\n\r\nVlyxes was a baron of Grece and off grete sotylte and duryng the long\r\nseege afore Troye, the whiche lestyd .x. yere, [when] that trwes were,\r\nhe fond pleys full sotyll and feyre for to disporte knyttes therewyth in\r\nthe tyme of soioure and rest. And some seyne that he fonde the game of\r\nthe chesse and sich othir lich. Therefor it is seide to the good knyght\r\nthat in dwe tyme men may wele play at sich games; for Solyn seith, “All\r\nthyngges that is sottyl and honest is lefull to be doone.”\r\n\r\nThe pleyes of Vlixes may be vnderstondyn that, when the knyghtly speryte\r\nshall be wery off prayer and of beyng in contemplacion, he may wele\r\ndisporte in redyng of Holy Scriptures; ffor, as Seynt Jerom seith, Holy\r\nScripture is sete in the yen of owre[498] [Sidenote: f. 63.] hertis as a\r\nmerowre, to the entent that we shuld se the herdly face[499] of owre\r\nsowle, and therefor may we see the lewdenes, there may we see who\r\nmyche[500] that we profyte and how fayre we ben [fro] profyte.[501] To\r\nthis purpose owre Lord seith in the Gospell, [“Scrutamini scripturas,\r\nquia vos putatis in ipsis vitam æternam habere”].[502]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                LXXXIV.\r\n\r\n        Yif thou wilt yeff the to Cupido,\r\n        Thy hert and all abaundon hire to,\r\n        Thynkke on Cresseides nwefanggyllnesse,[503]\r\n        For hire hert hade to meche dobylnesse.\r\n\r\nCresseide [was] a gentilwoman of grete beaute, an[d] she was yit more\r\nqwaynte and sotell to drawe pepill to hir.[504] Troylus, the yongest of\r\nPriantes sones, [the which] was full of grete gentilnesse, of beaute and\r\nof worthines, loued hire ryght hertily and she hade youen hym hir loue\r\nand promysyd to hym that it shuld neuyr fayle. Calcas, fadir to the\r\ngentilwoman, the which knew by science that Troye shuld be distroyid,\r\ndide so myche that his doughter was delyuered to hym and browght owte of\r\nthe cete and ledde to the seege among the Grekes, where hir fadir was.\r\nGrete was the sorowe and full petous the[505] complayntis of the .ii^o.\r\nlouers at the departyng. Neuerthelesse within a while aftir Dyomed, the\r\nwhich was a hye baron and a full worthi knyght, aqweynttyd hym with\r\nCresseide and labowrd so soore to hir that she loued hym and only[506]\r\nforyate hir trwe loue Troylus. Because that Cresseide was so lyght of\r\ncorage, it is seide to the gode knyght that, yf he will sette his herte\r\nin ony plase, late hym be ware that he be not aqwauyntyd with sich a\r\nlady as Cresseide was. And Hermes seith, “Kepe the from evill felachepe,\r\nthat thou be not on of theyme.”\r\n\r\nCresseide, of whom a man shulde be ware to aqweynt hym, is veyne glori,\r\nwith the which the good sperite shuld not aqwaynte hym, but fle it onto\r\nhis power, for it is to lyghte and commyth to sodenly. And Seynt Austyn\r\nopon the Sauter seith that he the which hath wele lerned and asayed by\r\nexperiens to ouergoo degrees of vices, he is coume to the knowlyge that\r\nthe synne of veyne glory is holy or most specyaly to eschwe of perfyȝte\r\nmen, ffor emong all othir synnes it is hardest to ouercom. Therefor the\r\napostil Seynt Poule seith, [“Qui gloriatur, in Domino glorietur”].[507]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 LXXXV.\r\n\r\n        When thou hast kylled Patroclus,\r\n        Ware of Achilles, I counsell þe thus,\r\n        Yf thou loue me, for thei be all on, [Sidenote: f. 64.]\r\n        There goods betweyne theym be comon.\r\n\r\nPatroclus and Achilles were felawes togedir and ryght dere freendis, so\r\nthat there were neuer to[508] brethere loued better togedir, and thei\r\nand here goodes were comon as all o thyng. And because that Hector slew\r\nPatroclus in batayle Achilles had grete hate to Hector, and fro theyns\r\nforthe swore his dethe. But because he doutyd meche his grete streynght,\r\nhe lefte neuer to wayte how he myght fynde hym discouered to betray hym.\r\nTherfor Othea seide to Hector, as by profecye of that which was for to\r\ncome, that, when he hadde sleyne Patroclus, it were nede for hym to be\r\nware of Achilles. That is to vnderstond þat euery man the which hath\r\nslayne or mysdoon to anothir mannys trwe freen, his[509] felawe will\r\ntake vengance if he may. Therefor Magdare[510] seith, “In what [place]\r\nthat euer thou be wyth thy ennemye, holde hym euer in suspecte,\r\nthow[511] that thow be myghtyer than he.”\r\n\r\nWhere it is seide that, when thow hast sleyne Patroclus thou shulde be\r\nware of Achilles, we may vnderstond that, yf the goode speryte suffir\r\nhym by the feend to bowe to synne, he howte[512] to dowte euerlastyng\r\ndethe.

And there the godes made it perpetuall for memorie\r\nof that aventure, and yit it answheris to pepill in valeyys and on\r\nreueres aftyr the woyse of othir, but it may not speke fryst. Eccho may\r\nsyngnyfie a persone the which off grete necessite requyryth the voyse\r\nthat is youen to anothir; that is to sey, of nedy pepyll there is\r\nabydyng enowe, for they may not helpe themselffe withowte helpe of\r\nothir.[517] Therefor it is seyde to the good knyght that he shuld haue\r\npete of nedy pepill that reqwyrith it. And Zaqualquin[518] seith, “Who\r\nso will kepe wele the lawe, shulde helpe hys frend with his goode and\r\nleue to nedi pepill and be gracious, not denying iustice to his enemy,\r\nand kepe hym fro vice and dishonour.”\r\n\r\nBe Echo, the which shuld not be refusyd, may be notyd the mercy þat the\r\ngood sperite shulde haue in hym selfe.

And when he was so nere\r\nthat she sawe well she myght not scape hym, she made hir prayers to the\r\ngodes Diane that she shulde save hire virginite, and the body of the\r\nmaydyn chaunged into a grene lorier; and when Phebus was come nere\r\ntherto, he tooke of the brawnches of the tre and made hym a chaplete in\r\nsyngne of victorie. And anamly in the tyme[522] of the Romayns greete\r\nfelicite the victorius pepill of theyme were crowned with [Sidenote: f.\r\n66.] lorier. This fabill may haue many vndirstondynges.

It is\r\nseide to the good knyght that he most pursue Damee, if that he will haue\r\na croune of lorier, that is to seyne, payne and traveyle, yf he will com\r\nto worchippe. To this purpose Omer seyth, “Be grete diligence a man\r\ncomyth to grete perfeccion.”\r\n\r\nThat Damee wolde be purswede for to have a croune of lorier, we may\r\nvndirstonde that, yf the goode speryth will haue a glorius victorie, he\r\nmust haue perseuerance, the which sall lede hym to the victorie of\r\nparadyse, of the which the ioies be infynite. As Seynt Grygory seith,\r\n“Who hath þat tong that may suffice to tell it, and where is the\r\nvndirstondyng that may or canne comprehend it, who[523] many ioyes be\r\nthere in that souereyne cete off paradyse, euer to be present[524] ...\r\nvisage of God, to se the vnscribable lyght, to be in surte neuer to haue\r\nfere off deth, to be mery with the gyfte of euerlastyng clennes?” To\r\nthis purpose Dauid seith in þe Savter, [“Gloriosa dicta sunt de te,\r\ncivitas Dei”].[525]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LXXXVIII.\r\n\r\n        To the also I make mencion\r\n        Off Andromathais[526] vision;\r\n        Dispite not thi wyfe, I counsell the,\r\n        Ne othir wemen that wise be.\r\n\r\nAvdromatha was Hectoures wyffe, and the nyght afore that he was sleyne\r\nthere com to his wyfe in a vision that the next daye that Hector went to\r\nthe batayle withowten dowte there he shuld be sleyne. For the which\r\nAndromatha with grete seghens and vepynges dide hire power that he shuld\r\nno goo into the batayle; but Hector wold not beleue hir and there he was\r\nslayne. Wherefor it is seide that a goode knyght shuld not holy\r\ndisprayse visions of his wife, that is to sey, in avice and the counsell\r\nof his wyfe, if he be wyse and well condiciond, and anamly of othir wise\r\nwomen. For Platon seith, “Thou shuld not disprayse the counsell of a\r\nlytill wise person, for, þough thou be neuer so olde, be not ashamed to\r\nlerne, though a childe wolde teche the, for some tyme the ingnorant may\r\navise the wise man.”\r\n\r\nThe avision of Andromatha, the whiche shulde not be dispreysed,\r\n[Sidenote: f. 67.] is that a good purpose sent by the Holy Gost Jhesu\r\nCristis knyght shuld not sette it at nought, but anoon sette it in\r\neffecte vnto his power. Thereoff spekyth Seynt Gregory in his Moralles\r\nthat the good Sperite for to draw vs to goodnes andmonychit vs, meveth\r\nvs and techitht vs. He admonychyt owre mynde, he meuith oure will and\r\ntechyt owre vnderstondynges. The Sperite, softe and swete, suffirth no\r\nmaner of litell spote of chaffe[527] abydyng in the habitacion of the\r\nherte where he inspiryth, but broyleth it anoon with his subtile\r\ncircunspeccion.[528] Therefore the postile Seynt Powle seith, [“Spiritum\r\nnolite extinguere”].[529]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                LXXXIX.\r\n\r\n        If that thoue haue grete werre and besy,\r\n        In Babilonies streynght verely\r\n        Troste not, for be Minos[530] and that soone\r\n        It was take; trosteth not than thereone.\r\n\r\nGrete Babilony was founded bi the grete gyaunt Nambroth,[531] and it was\r\nthe streyngest cete that euer was; but notwithstondyng it was take by\r\nknynght Minos.[532] Therefore it is seide to the good knyght that he\r\nshuld not so myche truste in the streynght of his cete or off his\r\ncastell in tyme off werre, but that it be full purveide off pepyll and\r\nof all thyng that behoueth for dwe defence. For Platon seith, “Who so\r\ntrostith all only in his streyngth is often ouercomen.”\r\n\r\nBe the streynth of Babilonie, wherein men shuld not trost, it is to\r\nvndirstonde that the good sperite shulde not trust ne attende to thynges\r\nthat the worlde promysith; and Seynt Austyn spekith therof in the booke\r\nof Syngularite of Clerkes,[533] that it is to lewde a trust[534] to name\r\nhis lyffe to be swre ayens the perell of this worlde. And it is a folych\r\nhope to wene to be saue among the byttynges[535] of synnys; yit the\r\nvictorie incerteyne is as long as men be among the dartes of there\r\nenmyes and kepith theyme vnhurte,[536] but who so is envirouned with\r\nflawmes is not lyghtly delyuered withowtyn brennyng. Trost to hym that\r\nhath the experience; though the world lawith[537] on the, tryst it not,\r\nlete thi hoope be sette in God. Therefor seith the prophete Dauid,\r\n“Spera in Domino,” etc.[538]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XC.\r\n\r\n        Hector me must pronunce thi deth smerte.\r\n        Wherefor grete sorwe bitteth my herte.\r\n        That shall [be] whene that Priant the kyng\r\n        [Thou] woldest not trost, which come the praying.[539]\r\n\r\nThe day that Hector was sleyne in bataile Andromatha his [Sidenote: f.\r\n68.] wiffe come to pray Kyng Priant with full grete compleyntes and\r\nwepynges that he wolde not that day suffre Hector to goo to bataile, for\r\nwithowte dowte he shulde be sleyne yf he went thedir.[540] Mars, the god\r\nof bataile, and Minerve, the godesse of armes, hade veraly shewed it\r\nthere in hir slepe,[541] where thei apperid to hir. Priant dide all that\r\nhe myghte for he shulde not fyght that day, but Hector stale fro his\r\nfadir and stirte owte of the cete by a waye vndir the erthe and went to\r\nthe bataile, where he was sleyne. And for because he neuer dishobehed\r\nhis fadir but that day, [it] may be seide the day that he shulde\r\ndishabey his ffadir than shulde he die. And it may be vnderstond that\r\nnoon shulde dishobey his souereyne ne his good ffrendes, when they awyse\r\nhym as in reson. And therfor Aristotil seide to Alexandir, “As long as\r\nthou trustist the cownsell of theyme that vsith wisdom and that loued\r\nthe truly, thou salt reigne glorously.”\r\n\r\nWhere she[542] seide to Hector that she most pronounce his name,[543]\r\n[it] is that the good sperite shulde haue contynell mynde on the owre of\r\ndeth. Thereof seith Seynt Bernard[544] that in mankyndely thynges men\r\nfynde no thyng more certeyne þan deth, ne lesse incerteyne than is the\r\nowre of deth; for deth hath no mercy of pouerte and dothe no worshippe\r\nto reches; it sparith neythir wisedom, condicions ne age; men hath non\r\nothir certeyne of deth but that it is at the doores of aged men and it\r\nis in the mydwes[545] of yong men. To this purpose the wise man seith,\r\n[“Memor esto, quoniam mors non tardat”].[546]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XCI.\r\n\r\n        I purpose yet to make the sadde and wyse,[547]\r\n        That thou vse in batailes ffor no gise\r\n        Off thyne harneis discouered for to be,\r\n        For thi deth than it will opyn to the.\r\n\r\nIn the bataile Hector was founde discouerede of his harneis, and thanne\r\nhe was sleyne. And therefor it is seide to the goode knyght that he\r\nshuld not in bataile be discouered of his harneis. For Hermes seyth that\r\ndeth farith as the stokke[548] of an arrowe and lyff farith as an arrowe\r\nthat is sette to shoote.[549]\r\n\r\nThere where it is seide that he shuld kepe hym couered with his harneis\r\nit is vndirstond that the good sperite shulde kepe his wittis cloose and\r\nnot voide. Seynt Grigori seith hereoff that a person the which departhit\r\nhys vittis fareth as a iowgolowre the [Sidenote: f. 69.] which fyndeth\r\nno wers hous than his owyn; therefor he is euer owte of his hows, euen\r\nas a man that kepith not his wittes clos is euer vagaunt and owte of the\r\nhous of his conscience and farith as an opyn hall where men may entre on\r\neuery syde. Therefor [our] Lorde seith in the Gospell, [“Clauso ostio,\r\nora Patrem tuum in abscondito.”][550]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XCII.\r\n\r\n        Of Pollibetes[551] coveite not hastly\r\n        His harmes, for thei be vnhappy;\r\n        Of his dispoylyng folowed, parde,\r\n        Thi wofull deth be theyme þat sewed þe.\r\n\r\nPolibetes was a full myghty kyng, the which Hector slewe in the bataile\r\nafter many othir grete dedes that he hadde done that day. And becawse\r\nthat he was harmede with ffayre harmes and reche, Hector coveite theyme\r\nand stowpyd doung of his hors nekke for to dispoyle the body, and than\r\nAchilles, the which swede after hym with hole will to take hym\r\ndiscouerte, smote hym beneth for fawte off his harmure and at oo stroke\r\nkylled hym, of whom it was grete harme, ffor a worthier knyght was neuer\r\ngyrte whyth swerde of the which stories maken mencion. And that sich\r\ncouetyses may be no noyens[552] in sich places it shewith bi the seide\r\ncas. Therefor the philosophir seith, “Disoordnet couetise[553] ledith a\r\nman to deth.”\r\n\r\nThat we shulde not couete Polibetis armis, we may vndirstond that the\r\ngoode speryte shuld haue no couetise to no maner of wordly thynges. For\r\nInnocent seith[554] that it ledith a man to deth, for covetise it is a\r\nfyre that may not be stawnched. The couetous person is neuer content to\r\nhaue that the which he desyrith, for, whan he hath that he desiryd, he\r\ndesyrith euer more, euer he setteth his ende in as mych as that he\r\ntenteth to have more and not to that the which he hath. Averyse and\r\ncovetise be .ii^o. saus makers,[555] the which sesseth neuer to seye,\r\n“Bryng, bryng”; and to the value that the money waxeth the loue of the\r\nmony waxeth. Couetise is the way to the gostly deth and oftetymes to\r\nbodily deth. Therefor the postyll Seynt Powle seith, [“Radix omnium\r\nmalorum cupiditas est”].[556]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XCIII.\r\n\r\n        Assote the not in love of strawnge kynde;\r\n        The deede of Achilles haue in mynde,\r\n        Which wende to make of hys enmye [Sidenote: f. 70.]\r\n        His veri lyffe and that interely.\r\n\r\nAchilles was asotyd in lowe of Polexene the faire mayden, the which was\r\nsister to Hector, as he sawe hir in the begynnyng of the yere at the\r\nservise off Ectoris yeris meynde[557] in the trwes tyme, where many\r\nGrekis went to Troye to see the nobilnes of the cete and of the reche\r\nterrement, that was the most solemny made that euer was made for the\r\nbody of a knyght. There Achilles sawe Polixenne, where he was sore takyn\r\nwith hir loue that he myght no wyse endure, and therefor he sent to\r\nHecuba the qwene that he wolde treite of mariage and he wolde make the\r\nwerre to sesse and the sege to departe and he shuld euer be there frend.\r\nIt was long after or Achilles armed ayens the Troyens becawse of that\r\nlowe and [he] dede grete peyne to make the ost to departe, but he myght\r\nnot doo it and therfor the mariage was notte made. After that Achilles\r\nslew Troylus, the which was so full of worthines that he was ryght leke\r\nto Hector his brothir, standyng the yong age that he hadde. But the\r\nqwene Ecuba was so full of woo for hym that she sent for Achilles to\r\ncome to hir to Troye ffor to treite of the mariage. He went thedir, and\r\nthere he was slayne. And þerfor it is seide to the good knyghte that he\r\nshuld not assote hym vpon strawnge loues, ffor by ferre loues comyth\r\nharme. And therfor the wyse [man] seith, “When thyn enemys may not venge\r\ntheyme, than hast thou nede to be ware.”\r\n\r\nThat a goode spyryte shulde not assote hym vpon strawnge loues, that is\r\nto vndirstond that he shulde chawnge[558] no thynge but yf it comme holy\r\nof God and [be] determined in hym. “All strange loues” is the worlde,\r\nthe which he shuld flee. That he shulde flee the worlde Seynt Austyn\r\nseith in expownyng of Seynt Jonis Pistil,[559] “The world passith [and\r\nits] concupiscens.[560] O resonable man,” than seith he, “whethir had\r\nthou leuer loue the temperell worlde and passe with the tyme, or be\r\nwith[561] Cryst Jhesu and lyfe perpetualy with hyme?” To this purpose\r\nSeynt Jon seith in his fryst Pistill, [“Nolite diligere mundum neque ea\r\nquæ in mundo sunt”].[562]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XCIV.\r\n\r\n        Vndirtake non harmes folely;\r\n        It is perell for sowle and body\r\n        A naked harme and no shelde to take;\r\n        Off Ayaux may thou example make.\r\n\r\nAyaux was a full prowd knyght of þe Grekis and trostid to mych on\r\nhymselfe, but yet he was a goode knyght of his hand. [Sidenote: f. 71.]\r\nAnd for pride and soleynnes he vndyrtooke to doo armes with his arme\r\nnaked discouered withowte a chelde, and so he was boron through[563] and\r\nouerthrowen dede. Therefore it is seide to the goode knyght that to doo\r\nsiche armes, thei be neythir profitabill ne worchipfull, but rather thei\r\nbe named lewde and prowde, and thei be to perlyous. Aristotil seith that\r\nmany erreth be ignorance and fawte of knowyng and woote not whate it is\r\nto do ne to leue, and some fayle be arrogance and pride.\r\n\r\nHow armes shulde not be vndertake follely is þat þe good sperite shulde\r\nnot tryst in his owyn fragilite. As Seynt Tawstyn[564] seyth in a\r\nsermon, þat non shulde presume in his owyn herte when he pronownceth a\r\nworde ne non sulde[565] [trust] in his streynghte when he sufferith\r\ntentacion, for, when we speke wysely goode wordes, thei coume of God and\r\nnot of owre wytte, and when we endure aduersitees stedefastly, it cometh\r\nof God and not of oure pacience. To this purpose the apostyl Seynt Powle\r\nseith, [“Fiduciam talem habemus per Christum ad Deum, non quod simus\r\nsufficientes aliquid cogitare ex nobis quasi ex nobis”].[566]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XCV.\r\n\r\n        Antenor exile and chase away,\r\n        Which purchassed ayens his contrey\r\n        Bothe treson, falsenes and grete vntrouth;\r\n        But yif he were yolden it were routh.\r\n\r\nAnthenor was a baron of Troie, and when it com at the last to grete\r\nTroyenne bateylles, the Grekys that hadde long kepte sege afore the cete\r\nthey wost not how they myght haue a conclusyon to take the cete, ffor it\r\nwas of ryght grete streynghte, than by the tysyng[567] of Anthenor. For\r\nangre that he hadde to kyng Priaunt, he comforted theyme and seide that\r\nthei shulde make a pes with the kyng, and by that mene thei may putte\r\ntheyme selue into the cete and they shall be youen a wey. Thus thei\r\ndede, by the which Troye was betrayed. And because that the treson\r\nhereoff was to grete and to evill, it is seide to the good knyght that\r\nall sich semblable, where he knoweth theyme, he shulde exile and chasse\r\ntheyme awey, for sich pepill be gretili to hate. Platon seyth that\r\ndisseyte is capteyne and gouernowre off shrewes.[568]\r\n\r\nBe Anthenor, the which shulde be chassed awey, we may [Sidenote: f. 72.]\r\nvnderstonde that the goode sperite shulde dryve away all thynges whereby\r\nony inconuenyence myght come to hyme. To this Seynt Austyn seith that he\r\nthat is not besy to eschewe inconueniencees[569] is leche a b[u]tyrflye\r\nthat turnyth so ofte abowte the fyre of the lampe that he birneth his\r\nwenges and thanne is drowned in the oyle, and to the birde that flieth\r\nso ofte abowte the glewe that he lesyth his feddris. Example of Seynte\r\nPetir, the which aboode so long in the princes courte of the lawe that\r\nhe fell into sich an inconuenience to renye[570] his Maystir. And the\r\nwyse man seith, [“Fuge a via malorum, ne transeas per eam”].[571]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XCVI.\r\n\r\n        In Mynervez tempell to offir\r\n        Thou shulde not thi ennemye suffre.\r\n        Take thou goode hede to the hors of tre;\r\n        Troye hadde yet bene, had that not be.\r\n\r\nThe Grekes hade made a feynte pes[572] with the Troyens by Anthemores\r\ntrayson. Thei seyde thei hadde avowed a gifte to Mynerve the godes, the\r\nwhich thei wolde offyr, and the[i] hadde made a horse of tre of an huge\r\ngrettenes, the which was full of men of armes, and it was so grete that\r\nthe yate of the cete most be brokyn for to late it cum in. And the hors\r\nwas sette opon whelis, that rolled it forth to the temple; and when\r\nnyght come and when the tovne was most in rest, than the knyghtes lepid\r\nowt of the hors and vent abowte in the cete, the which brente and kyllid\r\nand distroiid the towne. The[re]for it is seide to the good knyght that\r\nhe shulde not trost in no sich fantasies ne offerynges. To this purpose\r\na wyse man seith, “A man shulde dowte the sotiltees and the spies of his\r\nenemie, yif he be wise, and his shrewdenes,[573] yf he be a foole.”\r\n\r\nBy Minerve temple we may vnderstond holy chirch, where shulde not a been\r\noffird but prayer. And Seynt Awstyn seith in the booke of Feyth, that\r\nwithowte the ffelechippe of holy chirch and baptym no thyng may availe,\r\nne the dedes of mercye may not vaile to euerlastyng liffe, for withowte\r\nthe lappe of the chirch non helthe may be. There[for] Dauid seith in the\r\nSauter booke, [“Apud te laus mea in ecclesia magna”].[574]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XCVII.\r\n\r\n        Trost not to haue a sure castell;\r\n        For Ylyones towre, sette full well,\r\n        Was take and brent, and so was Thune.[575]\r\n        All is in the handes of fortune.\r\n\r\nYlyon was the mayster doongon of Troye and the faryst and [Sidenote: f.\r\n73.] the strengest castell that euer was made of the which stories\r\nmakyth mencion; but notwithstondyng it was take and brent and broute to\r\nnowte, and so was the cete of Thune, the which was some tyme a grete\r\nthyng. And becavse that sich causes falleth bi the chaungabilnes of\r\nfortvne, it is desirid that the good knyght shulde not be prowde in hyme\r\nselfe ne thynke hym selfe sure for no streyngh. Therefor Tholome[576]\r\nseith, “The hyer that a lorde be raysed the perlyouser is the\r\nouyrthrowe.”\r\n\r\nThat man shuld not wene to have a svre castell, we may vndirstond that\r\nthe good sperite shulde take non hede to no maner delite; for as\r\ndelitees be passyng and not svre and ledith a person to dampnacion,\r\nSeynt Jerom seith that it is inpossibile for a person to passe fro\r\ndelittes to delyttes, that is to sey, for to pase and lepe fro delites\r\nof this worlde to the delyttes of paradyse, the which fillyth the wombe\r\nhere and the sowle there. For the diuine condicion is vnbounde, for it\r\nis not yoven to thoo that weneth to haue the worlde euerlastyng in\r\ndelittes. And to this purpose is wreetyn in the Pocalipce, [“Quantum\r\nglorificavit se et in deliciis fuit, tantum date ei tormentum et\r\nluctum”].[577]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                XCVIII.\r\n\r\n        Eschwe thou shulde þe swyn of Circes,\r\n        Where that the knyttes[578] off Vlixes\r\n        Were turnyd to swyne as to the ye.\r\n        Vmbethynke the wele of this partie.\r\n\r\nCyrces was a qwene, whos reaume was opon the see of Ytaile, and she was\r\na grete enchaunteresse and knew meche of sorcery and wichcraft. And whan\r\nVlixes, the which wente to the se after the destruccion off Troye, as he\r\nwent to a returnyd[579] into his cuntre, throwe many grete and perlyous\r\ntormentes that he hadde he aryved at a hauen of the same lande. He sent\r\nto the qwene by his knyghtes to wete wheythir he myght swrely taken\r\nhauen in her lond or noon. Circes reseyuyd his knyghtes full gentely and\r\nof curtesei made ordeyne for theyme a potage full delicious to drynke,\r\nbut the potage hade sich a strengh that sodenly the knyghttes were\r\nchaunged into swyne. Circes may be vnderstond in many maners. It ma[y]\r\nbe vndirstonde be a lande or a cuntre where that knyghtes were putte in\r\nfowle and veleyns preson; and allso she may be lekened to a lady full of\r\nwantonnesse and ydilnes, that by hire many errant knyghtes, that is to\r\nsey, sewyng armes, þe which anamly were of Vlixes pepill, that is to\r\nvndirstonde, malicious and noyens, were kepte to soiorne as swyne. And\r\ntherefor it is seide to þe good knyght that he shulde not reste in sich\r\na soioryng. For Arystotill [Sidenote: f. 74.] seith, “He that is\r\nholy[580] in fornicacion may not be aloved[581] in the ende.”\r\n\r\nCyrceses swyne may we take for ypocrysy, the which the goode sperite\r\nshulde eschewe off all thynges. Ayens ypocrytes Seynt Gregory seith in\r\nhis Moralles,[582] that the lyfe of ypocrytes is but a frawdelous vysyon\r\nand as a fantasye ymagenid, the which shewith owtewarde lykenes of an\r\nymage, the which is not in very dede inwarde. To this purpose owre Lorde\r\nseith in the Gospell, [“Væ vobis, hypocritæ, quia similes estis\r\nsepulchris dealbatis,” etc.].[583]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XCIX.\r\n\r\n        Thou shulde no grete reson shewe to þe man\r\n        The which as that tyme vndirstond ne can.\r\n        Yno, the which the soddyn corne dide sowe,\r\n        Noteth it to the well inowgh, I trowe.\r\n\r\nYno was a qwene, the which made sothyn[584] corne to be sowen, the which\r\ncomme not vppe. And therfor it is seide to the goode knyght þat gode\r\nresons and weele sette and wyse autorites shulde not be tolde to the\r\npepill of rude vndirstondyng and that cannot vndirstond them, ffor they\r\nbe lost.

It is briefly as follows. Athamas\r\n  by command of Hera married the divine Nephele, and had by her Phrixus\r\n  and Helle. He was, however, more enamoured of Ino, who bore to him\r\n  Learchus and Melicertes. Nephele in her anger having returned to\r\n  heaven, Ino tried to get rid of her rival’s children. For this purpose\r\n  she caused a famine by roasting the seed-corn before it was sown, and\r\n  then bribed the messengers whom Athamas sent to Delphi for an oracle\r\n  to bring back word that Phrixus must be sacrificed. Nephele, however,\r\n  carried off Phrixus and his sister on the ram with the golden fleece,\r\n  while Athamas, driven mad by Hera, killed his son Learchus, and Ino\r\n  threw herself into the sea with Melicertes.\r\n\r\nFootnote 219:\r\n\r\n  _Sc._ sodden; semer le ble cuit, H.\r\n\r\nFootnote 220:\r\n\r\n  Hys, MS.\r\n\r\nFootnote 221:\r\n\r\n  He, MS.\r\n\r\nFootnote 222:\r\n\r\n  Yno, MS.; la deesse iuno, H.\r\n\r\nFootnote 223:\r\n\r\n  A hole in the roof for the escape of smoke, here perhaps used for the\r\n  hearth; le sueil, H.\r\n\r\nFootnote 224:\r\n\r\n  _Sic_, meaning apparently “warring”; but from the reading in H., “a\r\n  pou ne se entretuoyent,” it is perhaps a mistake for “near-hand,”\r\n  _sc._ nearly, almost.\r\n\r\nFootnote 225:\r\n\r\n  Quant la deesse virent tant espouentable, H.\r\n\r\nFootnote 226:\r\n\r\n  Sic ira corrumpit cor, si in alium diem duraverit, S.
