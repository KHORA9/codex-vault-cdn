Selecting his cut and uncut jewels from very various\r\nBuddhistic sources, Mr. Bowden has here supplied those who buy and use\r\nthe book with rubies and sapphires and emeralds of wisdom, compassion,\r\nand human brotherhood, any one of which, worn on the heart, would be\r\nsufficient to make the wearer rich beyond estimation for a day. The\r\nauthor disclaims any attempt to set forth a corpus of Buddhistic\r\nmorality and doctrine, nor, indeed, would anything of the kind be\r\npossible within such narrow limits; but I rejoice to observe how well\r\nand faithfully his manifold extracts from the Sacred Books of India\r\nand the East exhibit that ever-pervading tenderness of the great\r\nAsiatic Teacher, which extended itself to all alike that live. This\r\ncompassionateness of Gautama, if nothing else had been illustrated by\r\nthe collection, would render it precious to possess and fruitful to\r\nemploy; but many another lofty tenet of the \"Light\" of Asia finds\r\nillumination in some brief verse or maxim as day after day glides by;\r\nand he who should mark the passage of the months with these simple\r\npages must become, I think, a better man at the year's end than at\r\nits beginning. I recommend this compilation without hesitation or\r\nreserve.\r\n\r\nEDWIN ARNOLD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPILER'S PROEM.\r\n\r\nE. M. BOWDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this compilation no attempt has been made to present a general view\r\nof Buddhism as a religious or philosophical system. The aim has rather\r\nbeen to turn Buddhism to account as a moral force by bringing together\r\na selection of its beautiful sentiments, and lofty maxims, and\r\nparticularly including some of those which inculcate mercy to the\r\nlower animals.\r\n\r\nOn this point a far higher stand is taken by Buddhism than by\r\nChristianity--or at any rate than by Christianity as understood and\r\ninterpreted by those who ought to know. Not only is the whole question\r\nof our duties to the lower animals commonly ignored in Christian works\r\nas, for instance, in the famous Imitation of Christ, and scores of\r\nothers; but, as if this were not enough, a reasoned attempt has\r\nactually been made, on the strength of Christian teaching, to explode\r\nthe notion that animals have any right (e.g., in Moral Philosophy, by\r\nFather Joseph Rickaby). Very different in this respect is the tone of\r\nthe average Buddhist treatise, with its earnest exhortations,\r\nrecurring as a matter of course, to show mercy on every living thing;\r\nand this difference alone is an adequate reason for compiling a\r\nBuddhist anthology.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the sources quoted from, considerable latitude seemed\r\nallowable. They do not all, by any means, possess canonical authority.\r\nBut they are all distinctly Buddhist in character. The supposed dates\r\nof the originals range from at least the third century B. C. to\r\nmedieval and later times.\r\n\r\nHence, it is clear that, should any one think to make use of\r\nquotations from this work for controversial purposes, a certain degree\r\nof caution will be necessary. The context of the passage, and the date\r\nand the authorship of the original work, may all need to be taken into\r\naccount; while it must also be borne in mind that the religious terms,\r\nsuch as \"heaven\" and \"sin,\" which have to be employed in English, do\r\nnot always correspond exactly to the Buddhist conception.\r\n\r\nOf the numerous Buddhist works which have now been translated from\r\nsome eight or ten eastern languages, the greater number, when regarded\r\npurely as literature, occupy a very low level. At times they are so\r\nremarkably dull and silly that the reader is inclined to ask why they\r\nwere ever translated. But the one redeeming feature in the voluminous\r\ncompositions of Buddhist writers is the boundless compassion which\r\nthey consistently inculcate.\r\n\r\nThe insertion of a passage in these pages does not necessarily imply\r\nthat the compiler accepts in its entirety the teaching it conveys.\r\nConcerning that oft-repeated injunction, not to kill any living\r\ncreature whatsoever, we can hardly doubt that there are many cases in\r\nwhich to take life, provided it is taken painlessly, not only is not\r\non the whole an unkindness, but is an act of beneficence. If we\r\nsometimes give to this injunction the sense of extending our sympathy\r\nto the lowest sentient being, and not causing pain to living creatures\r\nwhile they live, we shall perhaps not be doing violence to the spirit\r\nof mercy by which it was prompted. There are many passages in Buddhist\r\nworks which advocate preference for the spirit over the letter, or the\r\nexercise of judgment in accepting what we are taught.\r\n\r\nA few passages, though not many, have been included more because they\r\nare striking or poetical than for the sake of their moral teaching.\r\n\r\nAs the references given are mostly to the Oriental origins, it is only\r\nfair to insert here a list of the English and French translations\r\nwhich have been principally used in compiling this book. The following\r\nworks comprise most of those which have proved directly of service for\r\nthe purpose--\"Sacred Books of the East,\" namely:\r\n\r\n     Vol. 10. Dhammapada, by F.
