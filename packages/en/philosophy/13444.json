LIGHT.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Search Me. Oh Thou Great Creator.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKNOWLEDGE IS SAFETY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The old maxim, that \"Knowledge is power,\" is a true one, but there\r\nis still a greater truth: \"KNOWLEDGE IS SAFETY.\" Safety amid physical\r\nills that beset mankind, and safety amid the moral pitfalls that\r\nsurround so many young people, is the great crying demand of the age.\r\n\r\n2. CRITICISM.--This work, though plain and to some extent startling,\r\nis chaste, practical and to the point, and will be a boon and a\r\nblessing to thousands who consult its pages. The world is full of\r\nignorance, and the ignorant will always criticise, because they live\r\nto suffer ills, for they know no better. New light is fast falling\r\nupon the dark corners, and the eyes of many are being opened.\r\n\r\n3. RESEARCHES OF SCIENCE.--The researches of science in the past few\r\nyears have thrown light on many facts relating to the physiology\r\nof man and woman, and the diseases to which they are subject, and\r\nconsequently many reformations have taken place in the treatment and\r\nprevention of diseases peculiar to the sexes.\r\n\r\n4. LOCK AND KEY.--Any information bearing upon the diseases of mankind\r\nshould not be kept under lock and key. The physician is frequently\r\ncalled upon to speak in plain language to his patients upon some\r\nprivate and startling disease contracted on account of ignorance. The\r\nbetter plan, however, is to so educate and enlighten old and young\r\nupon the important subjects of health, so that the necessity to call a\r\nphysician may occur less frequently.\r\n\r\n5. PROGRESSION.--A large, respectable, though diminishing class in\r\nevery community, maintain that nothing that relates exclusively to\r\neither sex should become the subject of popular medical instruction.\r\nBut such an opinion is radically wrong; ignorance is no more the\r\nmother of purity than it is of religion. Enlightenment can never work\r\ninjustice to him who investigates.\r\n\r\n6. AN EXAMPLE.--The men and women who study and practice medicine are\r\nnot the worse, but the better for such knowledge; so it would be to\r\nthe community in general if all would be properly instructed on the\r\nlaws of health which relate to the sexes.\r\n\r\n7. CRIME AND DEGRADATION.--Had every person a sound understanding on\r\nthe relation of the sexes, one of the most fertile sources of crime\r\nand degradation would be removed. Physicians know too well what sad\r\nconsequences are constantly occurring from a lack of proper knowledge\r\non these important subjects.\r\n\r\n8. A CONSISTENT CONSIDERATION.--Let the reader of this work study its\r\npages carefully and be able to give safe counsel and advice to others,\r\nand remember that purity of purpose and purity of character are the\r\nbrightest jewels in the crown of immortality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEGINNING RIGHT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING OF LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE BEGINNING.--There is a charm in opening manhood which has\r\ncommended itself to the imagination in every age. The undefined hopes\r\nand promises of the future--the dawning strength of intellect--the\r\nvigorous flow of passion--the very exchange of home ties and protected\r\njoys for free and manly pleasures, give to this period an interest and\r\nexcitement unfelt, perhaps, at any other.\r\n\r\n2. THE GROWTH OF INDEPENDENCE.--Hitherto life has been to boys, as to\r\ngirls, a dependent existence--a sucker from the parent growth--a home\r\ndiscipline of authority and guidance and communicated impulse. But\r\nhenceforth it is a transplanted growth of its own--a new and free\r\npower of activity in which the mainspring is no longer authority or\r\nlaw from without, but principle or opinion within. The shoot which\r\nhas been nourished under the shelter of the parent stem, and bent\r\naccording to its inclination, is transferred to the open world, where\r\nof its own impulse and character it must take root, and grow into\r\nstrength, or sink into weakness and vice.\r\n\r\n3. HOME TIES.--The thought of home must excite a pang even in the\r\nfirst moments of freedom. Its glad shelter--its kindly guidance--its\r\nvery restraints, how dear and tender must they seem in parting! How\r\nbrightly must they shine in the retrospect as the youth turns from\r\nthem to the hardened and unfamiliar face of the world! With what a\r\nsweet sadly-cheering pathos they must linger in the memory! And then\r\nwhat chance and hazard is there in his newly-gotten freedom! What\r\ninstincts of warning in its very novelty and dim inexperience! What\r\npossibilities of failure as well as of success in the unknown future\r\nas it stretches before him!\r\n\r\n4. VICE OR VIRTUE.--Certainly there is a grave importance as well as\r\na pleasant charm in the beginning of life. There is awe as well as\r\nexcitement in it when rightly viewed. The possibilities that lie in\r\nit of noble or ignoble work--of happy self-sacrifice or ruinous\r\nself-indulgence--the capacities in the right use of which it may rise\r\nto heights of beautiful virtue, in the abuse of which it may sink to\r\nthe depths of debasing vice--make the crisis one of fear as well as of\r\nhope, of sadness as well as of joy.\r\n\r\n5. SUCCESS OR FAILURE.--It is wistful as well as pleasing to think of\r\nthe young passing year by year into the world, and engaging with its\r\nduties, its interests, and temptations. Of the throng that struggle\r\nat the gates of entrance, how many may reach their anticipated goal?\r\nCarry the mind forward a few years, and some have climbed the hills\r\nof difficulty and gained the eminence on which they wished to\r\nstand--some, although they may not have done this, have kept their\r\ntruth unhurt, their integrity unspoiled; but others have turned back,\r\nor have perished by the way, or fallen in weakness of will, no more to\r\nrise again; victims or their own sin.\r\n\r\n6. WARNING.--As we place ourselves with the young at the opening gates\r\nof life, and think of the end from the beginning, it is a deep concern\r\nmore than anything else that fills us. Words of earnest argument and\r\nwarning counsel rather than of congratulation rise to our lips.\r\n\r\n7. MISTAKES ARE OFTEN FATAL.--Begin well and the habit of doing well\r\nwill become quite as easy as the habit of doing badly. \"Well begun\r\nis half ended,\" says the proverb: \"and a good beginning is half\r\nthe battle.\" Many promising young men have irretrievably injured\r\nthemselves by a first false step at the commencement of life; while\r\nothers of much less promising talents, have succeeded simply by\r\nbeginning well, and going onward. The good, practical beginning is\r\nto a certain extent, a pledge, a promise, and an assurance of the\r\nultimate prosperous issue. There is many a poor creature, now crawling\r\nthrough life, miserable himself and the cause of sorrow to others,\r\nwho might have lifted up his head and prospered, if, instead of merely\r\nsatisfying himself with resolutions of well-doing, he had actually\r\ngone to work and made a good, practical beginning.\r\n\r\n8. BEGIN AT THE RIGHT PLACE.--Too many are, however, impatient of\r\nresults. They are not satisfied to begin where their fathers did,\r\nbut where they left off. They think to enjoy the fruits of industry\r\nwithout working for them. They cannot wait for the results of labor\r\nand application, but forestall them by too early indulgence.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHEALTH A DUTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps nothing will so much hasten the time when body and mind will\r\nboth be adequately cared for, as a diffusion of the belief that the\r\npreservation of health is a duty. Few seem conscious that there is\r\nsuch a thing as physical morality.\r\n\r\nMen's habitual words and acts imply that they are at liberty to treat\r\ntheir bodies as they please. Disorder entailed by disobedience to\r\nnature's dictates they regard as grievances, not as the effects of\r\na conduct more or less flagitious. Though the evil consequences\r\ninflicted on their descendents and on future generations are often as\r\ngreat as those caused by crime, they do not think themselves in any\r\ndegree criminal.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in the case of drunkenness the viciousness of a bodily\r\ntransgression is recognized; but none appear to infer that if this\r\nbodily transgression is vicious, so too is every bodily transgression.\r\nThe fact is, all breaches of the law of health are physical sins.\r\n\r\nWhen this is generally seen, then, and perhaps not till then, will the\r\nphysical training of the young receive all the attention it deserves.\r\n\r\nPurity of life and thought should be taught in the home. It is the\r\nonly safeguard of the young. Let parents wake up on this important\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLADSTONE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVALUE OF REPUTATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. WHO SHALL ESTIMATE THE COST.--Who shall estimate the cost of a\r\npriceless reputation--that impress which gives this human dross its\r\ncurrency--without which we stand despised, debased, depreciated? Who\r\nshall repair it injured? Who can redeem it lost? Oh, well and truly\r\ndoes the great philosopher of poetry esteem the world's wealth as\r\n\"trash\" in the comparison. Without it gold has no value; birth, no\r\ndistinction; station, no dignity; beauty, no charm; age, no reverence;\r\nwithout it every treasure impoverishes, every grace deforms,\r\nevery dignity degrades, and all the arts, the decorations and\r\naccomplishments of life stand, like the beacon-blaze upon a rock,\r\nwarning the world that its approach is dangerous; that its contact is\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n2. THE WRETCH WITHOUT IT.--The wretch without it is under eternal\r\nquarantine; no friend to greet; no home to harbor him, the voyage of\r\nhis life becomes a joyless peril, and in the midst of all ambition\r\ncan achieve, or avarice amass, or rapacity plunder, he tosses on the\r\nsurge, a buoyant pestilence. But let me not degrade into selfishness\r\nof individual safety or individual exposure this individual principle;\r\nit testifies a higher, a more ennobling origin.\r\n\r\n3. ITS DIVINITY.--Oh, Divine, oh, delightful legacy of a spotless\r\nreputation: Rich is the inheritance it leaves; pious the example\r\nit testifies; pure, precious and imperishable, the hope which it\r\ninspires; can there be conceived a more atrocious injury than to filch\r\nfrom its possessor this inestimable benefit to rob society of its\r\ncharm, and solitude of its solace; not only to out-law life, but\r\nattain death, converting the very grave, the refuge of the sufferer,\r\ninto the gate of infamy and of shame.\r\n\r\n4. LOST CHARACTER.--We can conceive few crimes beyond it. He who\r\nplunders my property takes from me that which can be repaired by time;\r\nbut what period can repair a ruined reputation? He who maims my person\r\neffects that which medicine may remedy; but what herb has sovereignty\r\nover the wounds of slander? He who ridicules my poverty or reproaches\r\nmy profession, upbraids me with that which industry may retrieve, and\r\nintegrity may purify; but what riches shall redeem the bankrupt fame?\r\nWhat power shall blanch the sullied show of character? There can be\r\nno injury more deadly. There can be no crime more cruel. It is without\r\nremedy. It is without antidote. It is without evasion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GATHERING WILD FLOWERS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF ASSOCIATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you always live with those who are lame, you will learn to\r\nlimp.--FROM THE LATIN.\r\n\r\nIf men wish to be held in esteem, they must associate with those who\r\nare estimable.--LA BRUYERE.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. BY WHAT MEN ARE KNOWN.--An author is known by his writings, a\r\nmother by her daughter, a fool by his words, and all men by their\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\n2. FORMATION OF A GOOD CHARACTER.--Intercourse with persons of decided\r\nvirtue and excellence is of great importance in the formation of a\r\ngood character. The force of example is powerful; we are creatures of\r\nimitation, and, by a necessary influence, our tempers and habits\r\nare very much formed on the model of those with whom we familiarly\r\nassociate. Better be alone than in bad company. Evil communications\r\ncorrupt good manners. Ill qualities are catching as well as diseases;\r\nand the mind is at least as much, if not a great deal more, liable to\r\ninfection, than the body. Go with mean people, and you think life is\r\nmean.\r\n\r\n3. GOOD EXAMPLE.--How natural is it for a child to look up to those\r\naround him for an example of imitation, and how readily does he copy\r\nall that he sees done, good or bad. The importance of a good example\r\non which the young may exercise this powerful and active element of\r\ntheir nature, is a matter of the utmost moment.\r\n\r\n4. A TRUE MAXIM.--It is a trite, but true maxim, that \"a man is known\r\nby the company he keeps.\" He naturally assimilates by the force\r\nof imitation, to the habits and manners of those by whom he is\r\nsurrounded. We know persons who walk much with the lame, who have\r\nlearned to walk with a hitch or limp like their lame friends. Vice\r\nstalks in the streets unabashed, and children copy it.\r\n\r\n5. LIVE WITH THE CULPABLE.--Live with the culpable, and you will\r\nbe very likely to die with the criminal. Bad company is like a nail\r\ndriven into a post, which after the first or second blow, may be drawn\r\nout with little difficulty; but being once driven in up to the head,\r\nthe pinchers cannot take hold to draw it out, which can only be done\r\nby the destruction of the wood. You may be ever so pure, you cannot\r\nassociate with bad companions without falling into bad odor.\r\n\r\n6. SOCIETY OF THE VULGAR.--Do you love the society of the vulgar? Then\r\nyou are already debased in your sentiments. Do you seek to be with\r\nthe profane? In your heart you are like them. Are jesters and buffoons\r\nyour choice friends? He who loves to laugh at folly is himself a fool.\r\nDo you love and seek the society of the wise and good? Is this your\r\nhabit? Had you rather take the lowest seat among these than the\r\nhighest seat among others? Then you have already learned to be good.\r\nYou may not make very much progress, but even a good beginning is not\r\nto be despised.\r\n\r\n7. SINKS OF POLLUTION.--Strive for mental excellence, and strict\r\nintegrity, and you never will be found in the sinks of pollution, and\r\non the benches of retailers and gamblers. Once habituate yourself to a\r\nvirtuous course, once secure a love of good society, and no punishment\r\nwould be greater than by accident to be obliged for half a day to\r\nassociate with the low and vulgar. Try to frequent the company of your\r\nbetters.\r\n\r\n8. PROCURE NO FRIEND IN HASTE.--Nor, if once secured, in haste abandon\r\nthem. Be slow in choosing an associate, and slower to change him;\r\nslight no man for poverty, nor esteem any one for his wealth. Good\r\nfriends should not be easily forgotten, nor used as suits of apparel,\r\nwhich, when we have worn them threadbare, we cast them off, and call\r\nfor new. When once you profess yourself a friend, endeaver to be\r\nalways such. He can never have any true friends that will be often\r\nchanging them.\r\n\r\n9. HAVE THE COURAGE TO CUT THE MOST AGREEABLE ACQUAINTANCE.--Do this\r\nwhen you are convinced that he lacks principle; a friend should bear\r\nwith a friend's infirmities, but not with his vices. He that does a\r\nbase thing in zeal for his friend, burns the golden thread that ties\r\ntheir hearts together.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSELF-CONTROL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Honor and profit do not always lie in the same sack.\"--GEORGE\r\nHERBERT.\r\n\r\n\"The government of one's self is the only true freedom for the\r\nindividual.\"--FREDERICK PERTHES.\r\n\r\n\"It is length of patience, and endurance, and forbearance that so much\r\nof what is called good in mankind and womankind is shown.\"--ARTHUR\r\nHELPS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. ESSENCE OF CHARACTER.--Self-control is only courage under another\r\nform. It may also be regarded as the primary essence of character. It\r\nis in virtue of this quality that Shakespeare defines man as a being\r\n\"looking before and after.\" It forms the chief distinction between man\r\nand the mere animal; and, indeed, there can be no true manhood\r\nwithout it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RESULT OF BAD COMPANY.]\r\n\r\n2. ROOT OF ALL THE VIRTUES.--Self-control is at the root of all the\r\nvirtues. Let a man give the reins to his impulses and passions, and\r\nfrom that moment he yields up his moral freedom. He is carried along\r\nthe current of life, and becomes the slave of his strongest desire for\r\nthe time being.\r\n\r\n3. RESIST INSTINCTIVE IMPULSE.--To be morally free--to be more than an\r\nanimal--man must be able to resist instinctive impulse, and this can\r\nonly be done by exercise of self-control. Thus it is this power which\r\nconstitutes the real distinction between a physical and a moral life,\r\nand that forms the primary basis of individual character.\r\n\r\n4. A STRONG MAN RULETH HIS OWN SPIRIT.--In the Bible praise is given,\r\nnot to a strong man who \"taketh a city,\" but to the stronger man who\r\n\"ruleth his own spirit.\" This stronger man is he who, by discipline,\r\nexercises a constant control over his thoughts, his speech, and his\r\nacts. Nine-tenths of the vicious desires that degrade society, and\r\nwhich, when indulged, swell into the crimes that disgrace it,\r\nwould shrink into insignificance before the advance of valiant\r\nself-discipline, self-respect, and self-control. By the watchful\r\nexercise of these virtues, purity of heart and mind become habitual,\r\nand the character is built up in chastity, virtue, and temperance.\r\n\r\n5. THE BEST SUPPORT.--The best support of character will always be\r\nfound in habit, which, according as the will is directed rightly or\r\nwrongly, as the case may be, will prove either a benignant ruler, or\r\na cruel despot. We may be its willing subject on the one hand, or its\r\nservile slave on the other. It may help us on the road to good, or it\r\nmay hurry us on the road to ruin.\r\n\r\n6. THE IDEAL MAN.--\"In the supremacy of self-control,\" says Herbert\r\nSpencer, \"consists one of the perfections of the ideal man. Not to be\r\nimpulsive, not to be spurred hither and thither by each desire that\r\nin turn comes upper-most, but to be self-restrained, self-balanced,\r\ngoverned by the joint decision of the feelings in council assembled,\r\nbefore whom every action shall have been fully debated, and calmly\r\ndetermined--that it is which education, moral education at least,\r\nstrives to produce.\"\r\n\r\n7. THE BEST REGULATED HOME.--The best regulated home is always that\r\nin which the discipline is the most perfect, and yet where it is the\r\nleast felt. Moral discipline acts with the force of a law of nature.\r\nThose subject to it yield themselves to it unconsciously; and though\r\nit shapes and forms the whole character, until the life becomes\r\ncrystallized in habit, the influence thus exercised is for the most\r\npart unseen and almost unfelt.\r\n\r\n8. PRACTICE SELF-DENIAL.--If a man would get through life honorably\r\nand peaceably, he must necessarily learn to practice self-denial\r\nin small things as well as in great. Men have to bear as well as to\r\nforbear. The temper has to be held in subjection to the judgment;\r\nand the little demons of ill-humor, petulance, and sarcasm, kept\r\nresolutely at a distance. If once they find an entrance to the mind,\r\nthey are apt to return, and to establish for themselves a permanent\r\noccupation there.\r\n\r\n9. POWER OF WORDS.--It is necessary to one's personal happiness, to\r\nexercise control over one's words as well as acts: for there are\r\nwords that strike even harder than blows; and men may \"speak daggers,\"\r\nthough they use none. The stinging repartee that rises to the lips,\r\nand which, if uttered, might cover an adversary with confusion, how\r\ndifficult it is to resist saying it! \"Heaven, keep us,\" says Miss\r\nBremer, in her 'Home', \"from the destroying power of words! There are\r\nwords that sever hearts more than sharp swords do; there are words the\r\npoint of which sting the heart through the course of a whole life.\"\r\n\r\n10. CHARACTER EXHIBITS ITSELF.--Character exhibits itself in\r\nself-control of speech as much as in anything else. The wise and\r\nforbearant man will restrain his desire to say a smart or severe thing\r\nat the expense of another's feeling; while the fool blurts out what he\r\nthinks, and will sacrifice his friend rather than his joke. \"The mouth\r\nof a wise man,\" said Solomon, \"is in his heart; the heart of a fool is\r\nin his mouth.\"\r\n\r\n11. BURNS.--No one knew the value of self-control better than the poet\r\nBurns, and no one could teach it more eloquently to others, but when\r\nit came to practice, Burns was as weak as the weakest. He could not\r\ndeny himself the pleasure of uttering a harsh and clever sarcasm at\r\nanother's expense. One of his biographers observed of him, that it\r\nwas no extravagant arithmetic to say that for every ten jokes he made\r\nhimself a hundred enemies. But this was not all. Poor Burns exercised\r\nno control over his appetites, but freely gave them the rein:\r\n\r\n  \"Thus thoughtless follies laid him low,\r\n  And stained his name.\"\r\n\r\n12. SOW POLLUTION.--Nor had he the self-denial to resist giving\r\npublicity to compositions originally intended for the delight of the\r\ntap-room, but which continued secretly to sow pollution broadcast in\r\nthe minds of youth. Indeed, notwithstanding the many exquisite poems\r\nof this writer, it is not saying too much that his immoral writings\r\nhave done far more harm than his purer writings have done good; and\r\nit would be better that all his writings should be destroyed and\r\nforgotten, provided his indecent songs could be destroyed with them.\r\n\r\n13. MORAL PRINCIPLE.--Many of our young men lack moral principle. They\r\ncannot look upon a beautiful girl with a pure heart and pure thoughts.\r\nThey have not manifested or practiced that self-control which develops\r\ntrue manhood and brings into subordination evil thoughts, evil\r\npassions, and evil practices. Men who have no self-control will find\r\nlife a failure, both in a social and in a business sense. The world\r\ndespises an insignificant person who lacks backbone and character.\r\nStand upon your manhood and womanhood; honor your convictions, and\r\ndare to do right.\r\n\r\n14. STRONG DRINK.--There is the habit of strong drink. It is only the\r\nlack of self-control that brings men into the depths of degradation;\r\non account of the cup, the habit of taking drink occasionally in\r\nits milder forms--of playing with a small appetite that only needs\r\nsufficient playing with to make you a demon or a dolt. You think you\r\nare safe; I know you are not safe, if you drink at all; and when you\r\nget offended with the good friends that warn you of your danger,\r\nyou are a fool. I know that the grave swallows daily, by scores,\r\ndrunkards, every one of whom thought he was safe while he was forming\r\nhis appetite. But this is old talk. A young man in this age who forms\r\nthe habit of drinking, or puts himself in danger of forming the habit,\r\nis usually so weak that he does not realize the consequences.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOST SELF-CONTROL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHABIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is almost as difficult to make a man unlearn his Errors as his\r\nKnowledge.--COLTON.\r\n\r\nThere are habits contracted by bad example, or bad management, before\r\nwe have judgment to discern their approaches, or because the eye of\r\nReason is laid asleep, or has not compass of view sufficient to look\r\naround on every quarter.--TUCKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. HABIT.--Our real strength in life depends upon habits formed in\r\nearly life. The young man who sows his wild oats and indulges in the\r\nsocial cup, is fastening chains upon himself that never can be broken.\r\nThe innocent youth by solitary practice of self-abuse will fasten upon\r\nhimself a habit which will wreck his physical constitution and bring\r\nsuffering and misery and ruin. Young man and young woman, beware of\r\nbad habits formed in early life.\r\n\r\n2. A BUNDLE OF HABITS.--Man, it has been said, is a bundle of habits;\r\nand habit is second nature. Metastasio entertained so strong an\r\nopinion as to the power of repetition in act and thought, that he\r\nsaid, \"All is habit in mankind, even virtue itself.\" Evil habits\r\nmust be conquered, or they will conquer us and destroy our peace and\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\n3. VICIOUS HABITS.--Vicious habits, when opposed, offer the most\r\nvigorous resistence on the first attack. At each successive encounter\r\nthis resistence grows fainter and fainter, until finally it ceases\r\naltogether and the victory is achieved. Habit is man's best friend and\r\nworst enemy; it can exalt him to the highest pinnacle of virtue, honor\r\nand happiness, or sink him to the lowest depths of vice, shame and\r\nmisery.\r\n\r\n4. HONESTY, OR KNAVERY.--We may form habits of honesty, or knavery;\r\ntruth, or falsehood; of industry, or idleness; frugality,\r\nor extravagance; of patience, or impatience; self-denial, or\r\nself-indulgence; of kindness, cruelty, politeness, rudeness, prudence,\r\nperseverance, circumspection. In short, there, is not a virtue, nor a\r\nvice; not an act of body, nor of mind, to which we may not be chained\r\ndown by this despotic power.\r\n\r\n5. BEGIN WELL.--It is a great point for young men to begin well; for\r\nit is the beginning of life that that system of conduct is adopted\r\nwhich soon assumes the force of habit. Begin well, and the habit\r\nof doing well will become quite easy, as easy as the habit of doing\r\nbadly. Pitch upon that course of life which is the most excellent, and\r\nhabit will render it the most delightful.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA GOOD NAME.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE LONGING FOR A GOOD NAME.--The longing for a good name is one\r\nof those laws of nature that were passed for the soul and written down\r\nwithin to urge toward a life of action, and away from small or wicked\r\naction. So large is this passion that it is set forth in poetic\r\nthought, as having a temple grand as that of Jupiter or Minerva, and\r\nup whose marble steps all noble minds struggle--the temple of Fame.\r\n\r\n2. CIVILIZATION.--Civilization is the ocean of which the millions of\r\nindividuals are the rivers and torrents. These rivers and torrents\r\nswell with those rains of money and home and fame and happiness,\r\nand then fall and run almost dry, but the ocean of civilization has\r\ngathered up all these waters, and holds them in sparkling beauty\r\nfor all subsequent use. Civilization is a fertile delta made by the\r\ndrifting souls of men.\r\n\r\n3. FAME.--The word \"fame\" never signifies simply notoriety. The\r\nmeaning of the direct term may be seen from its negation or opposite,\r\nfor only the meanest of men are called infamous. They are utterly\r\nwithout fame, utterly nameless; but if fame implied only notoriety,\r\nthen infamous would possess no marked significance. Fame is an\r\nundertaker that pays but little attention to the living, but who\r\nbedizens the dead, furnishes out their funerals and follows them to\r\nthe grave.\r\n\r\n4. LIFE-MOTIVE.--So in studying that life-motive which is called a\r\n\"good name,\" we must ask the large human race to tell us the high\r\nmerit of this spiritual longing. We must read the words of the sage,\r\nwho said long centuries ago that \"a good name was rather chosen than\r\ngreat riches.\" Other sages have said as much. Solon said that \"He that\r\nwill sell his good name will sell the State.\" Socrates said, \"Fame is\r\nthe perfume of heroic deeds.\" Our Shakespeare said, \"He lives in fame\r\nwho died in virtue's cause.\"\r\n\r\n5. INFLUENCES OF OUR AGE.--Our age is deeply influenced by the motives\r\ncalled property and home and pleasure, but it is a question whether\r\nthe generation in action today and the generation on the threshold\r\nof this intense life are conscious fully of the worth of an honorable\r\nname.\r\n\r\n6. BEAUTY OF CHARACTER.--We do not know whether with us all a good\r\nname is less sweet than it was with our fathers, but this is painfully\r\nevident that our times do not sufficiently behold the beauty of\r\ncharacter--their sense does not detect quickly enough or love deeply\r\nenough this aroma of heroic deeds.\r\n\r\n7. SELLING OUT THEIR REPUTATION.--It is amazing what multitudes there\r\nare who are willing to sell out their reputation, and amazing at what\r\na low price they will make the painful exchange. Some king remarked\r\nthat he would not tell a lie for any reward less than an empire. It\r\nis not uncommon in our world for a man to sell out all his honor and\r\nhopes for a score or a half score of dollars.\r\n\r\n8. PRISONS OVERFLOWING.--Our prisons are all full to overflowing of\r\nthose who took no thought of honor. They have not waited for an empire\r\nto be offered them before they would violate the sacred rights of man,\r\nbut many of them have even murdered for a cause that would not have\r\njustified even an exchange of words.\r\n\r\n9. INTEGRITY THE PRIDE OF THE GOVERNMENT.--If integrity were made the\r\npride of the government, the love of it would soon spring up among the\r\npeople. If all fraudulent men should go straight to jail, pitilessly,\r\nand if all the most rigid characters were sought out for all political\r\nand commercial offices, there would soon come a popular honesty just\r\nas there has come a love of reading or of art. It is with character as\r\nwith any new article--the difficulty lies in its first introduction.\r\n\r\n10. A NEW VIRTUE.--May a new virtue come into favor, all our high\r\nrewards, those from the ballot-box, those from employers, the rewards\r\nof society, the rewards of the press, should be offered only to\r\nthe worthy. A few years of rewarding the worthy would result in a\r\nwonderful zeal in the young to build up, not physical property, but\r\nmental and spiritual worth.\r\n\r\n11. BLESSING THE FAMILY GROUP.--No young man or young woman can by\r\nindustry and care reach an eminence in study or art or character,\r\nwithout blessing the entire family group. We have all seen that the\r\nfather and mother feel that all life's care and labor were at last\r\nperfectly rewarded in the success of their child. But had the child\r\nbeen reckless or indolent, all this domestic joy--the joy of a large\r\ngroup--would have been blighted forever.\r\n\r\n12. AN HONORED CHILD.--There have been triumphs at old Rome, where\r\nvictors marched along with many a chariot, many an elephant, and many\r\nspoils of the East; and in all times money has been lavished in the\r\nefforts of States to tell their pleasure in the name of some general;\r\nbut more numerous and wide-spread and beyond expression, by chariot\r\nor cannon or drum, have been those triumphal hours, when some son or\r\ndaughter has returned to the parental hearth beautiful in the wreaths\r\nof some confessed excellence, bearing a good name.\r\n\r\n13. RICH CRIMINALS.--We looked at the utter wretchedness of the men\r\nwho threw away reputation, and would rather be rich criminals in exile\r\nthan be loved friends and persons at home.\r\n\r\n14. AN EMPTY, OR AN EVIL NAME.--Young and old cannot afford to bear\r\nthe burden of an empty or an evil name. A good name is a motive of\r\nlife. It is a reason for that great encampment we call an existence.\r\nWhile you are building the home of to-morrow, build up also that kind\r\nof soul that can sleep sweetly on home's pillow, and can feel that God\r\nis not near as an avenger of wrong, but as the Father not only of the\r\nverdure and the seasons, but of you.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EGYPTIAN DANCER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE MOTHER'S INFLUENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mother, O mother, my heart calls for you,\r\n  Many a Summer the grass has grown green,\r\n  Blossomed and faded, our faces between;\r\n  Yet with strong yearning and passionate pain,\r\n  Long I to-night for your presence again.\r\n  --_Elizabeth Akers Allen._\r\n\r\n\r\n  A mother is a mother still,\r\n  The holiest thing alive.\r\n  --_Coleridge._\r\n\r\n\r\n  There is none,\r\n  In all this cold and hollow world, no fount\r\n  Of deep, strong, deathless love, save that within\r\n  A mother's heart.\r\n  --_Mrs. Hemans._\r\n\r\n\r\n  And all my mother came into mine eyes,\r\n  And gave me up to tears.\r\n  --_Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. HER INFLUENCE.--It is true to nature, although it be expressed in\r\na figurative form, that a mother is both the morning and the evening\r\nstar of life. The light of her eye is always the first to rise, and\r\noften the last to set upon man's day of trial. She wields a power more\r\ndecisive far than syllogisms in argument or courts of last appeal in\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n2. HER LOVE.--Mother! ecstatic sound so twined round our hearts that\r\nthey must cease to throb ere we forget it; 'tis our first love; 'tis\r\npart of religion. Nature has set the mother upon such a pinnacle that\r\nour infant eyes and arms are first uplifted to it; we cling to it in\r\nmanhood; we almost worship it in old age.\r\n\r\n3. HER TENDERNESS.--Alas! how little do we appreciate a mother's\r\ntenderness while living. How heedless are we in youth of all her\r\nanxieties and kindness! But when she is dead and gone, when the\r\ncares and coldness of the world come withering to our hearts, when we\r\nexperience for ourselves how hard it is to find true sympathy, how few\r\nto love us, how few will befriend us in misfortune, then it is that we\r\nthink of the mother we have lost.\r\n\r\n4. HER CONTROLLING POWER.--The mother can take man's whole nature\r\nunder her control. She becomes what she has been called \"The Divinity\r\nof Infancy.\" Her smile is its sunshine, her word its mildest law,\r\nuntil sin and the world have steeled the heart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PRAYERFUL AND DEVOTED MOTHER.]\r\n\r\n5. THE LAST TIE.--The young man who has forsaken the advice and\r\ninfluence of his mother has broken the last cable and severed the last\r\ntie that binds him to an honorable and upright life. He has forsaken\r\nhis best friend, and every hope for his future welfare may be\r\nabandoned, for he is lost forever, if he is faithless to mother, he\r\nwill have but little respect for wife and children.\r\n\r\n6. HOME TIES.--The young man or young woman who love their home and\r\nlove their mother can be safely trusted under almost any and all\r\ncircumstances, and their life will not be a blank, for they seek what\r\nis good. Their hearts will be ennobled, and God will bless them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOME AMUSEMENTS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHOME POWER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The mill-streams that turn the clappers of the world arise in\r\nsolitary places.\"--HELPS.\r\n\r\n  \"Lord! with what care hast Thou begirt us round!\r\n  Parents first season us. Then schoolmasters\r\n  Deliver us to laws. They send us bound\r\n  To rules of reason.\"--GEORGE HERBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. SCHOOL OF CHARACTER.--Home is the first and most important school\r\nof character. It is there that every human being receives his best\r\nmoral training, or his worst, for it is there that he imbibes those\r\nprinciples of conduct which endure through manhood, and cease only\r\nwith life.\r\n\r\n2. HOME MAKES THE MAN.--It is a common saying, \"Manners make the\r\nman;\" and there is a second, that \"Mind makes the man;\" but truer than\r\neither is a third, that \"Home makes the man.\" For the home-training\r\nincludes not only manners and mind, but character. It is mainly in the\r\nhome that the heart is opened, the habits are formed, the intellect is\r\nawakened, and character moulded for good or for evil.\r\n\r\n3. GOVERN SOCIETY.--From that source, be it pure or impure, issue\r\nthe principles and maxims that govern society. Law itself is but the\r\nreflex of homes. The tiniest bits of opinion sown in the minds of\r\nchildren in private life afterwards issue forth to the world, and\r\nbecome its public opinion; for nations are gathered out of nurseries,\r\nand they who hold the leading-strings of children may even exercise a\r\ngreater power than those who wield the reins of government.\r\n\r\n4. THE CHILD IS FATHER OF THE MAN.--The child's character is the\r\nnucleus of the man's; all after-education is but superposition; the\r\nform of the crystal remains the same. Thus the saying of the poet\r\nholds true in a large degree, \"The child is father of the man;\" or\r\nas Milton puts it, \"The childhood shows the man, as morning shows the\r\nday.\" Those impulses to conduct which last the longest and are rooted\r\nthe deepest, always have their origin near our birth. It is then that\r\nthe germs of virtues or vices, of feelings or sentiments, are first\r\nimplanted which determine the character of life.\r\n\r\n5. NURSERIES.--Thus homes, which are nurseries of children who grow\r\nup into men and women, will be good or bad according to the power that\r\ngoverns them. Where the spirit of love and duty pervades the home,\r\nwhere head and heart bear rule wisely there, where the daily life\r\nis honest and virtuous, where the government is sensible, kind, and\r\nloving, then may we expect from such a home an issue of healthy,\r\nuseful, and happy beings, capable as they gain the requisite strength,\r\nof following the footsteps of their parents, of walking uprightly,\r\ngoverning themselves wisely, and contributing to the welfare of those\r\nabout them.\r\n\r\n6. IGNORANCE, COARSENESS, AND SELFISHNESS.--On the other hand, if\r\nsurrounded by ignorance, coarseness, and selfishness, they will\r\nunconsciously assume the same character, and grow up to adult years\r\nrude, uncultivated, and all the more dangerous to society if placed\r\namidst the manifold temptations of what is called civilized life.\r\n\"Give your child to be educated by a slave,\" said an ancient Greek\r\n\"and, instead of one slave, you will then have two.\"\r\n\r\n7. MATERNAL LOVE.--Maternal love is the visible providence of our\r\nrace. Its influence is constant and universal. It begins with the\r\neducation of the human being at the outstart of life, and is prolonged\r\nby virtue of the powerful influence which every good mother exercises\r\nover her children through life. When launched into the world, each\r\nto take part in its labors, anxieties, and trials, they still turn\r\nto their mother for consolation, if not for counsel, in their time of\r\ntrouble and difficulty. The pure and good thoughts she has implanted\r\nin their minds when children continue to grow up into good acts long\r\nafter she is dead; and when there is nothing but a memory of her left,\r\nher children rise up and call her blessed.\r\n\r\n8. WOMAN, ABOVE ALL OTHER EDUCATORS, educates humanly. Man is the\r\nbrain, but woman is the heart of humanity; he its judgment, she its\r\nfeeling; he its strength, she its grace, ornament and solace. Even\r\nthe understanding of the best woman seems to work mainly through\r\nher affections. And thus, though man may direct the intellect, woman\r\ncultivates the feelings, which mainly determine the character. While\r\nhe fills the memory, she occupies the heart. She makes us love what\r\nhe can make us only believe, and it is chiefly through her that we are\r\nenabled to arrive at virtue.\r\n\r\n9. THE POOREST DWELLING, presided over by a virtuous, thrifty,\r\ncheerful, and cleanly woman may thus be the abode of comfort, virtue\r\nand happiness; it may be the scene of every enobling relation\r\nin family life; it may be endeared to man by many delightful\r\nassociations; furnishing a sanctuary for the heart, a refuge from the\r\nstorms of life, a sweet resting-place after labor, a consolation in\r\nmisfortune, a pride in prosperity and a joy at all times.\r\n\r\n10. THE GOOD HOME IS THUS THE BEST OF SCHOOLS, not only in youth\r\nbut in age. There young and old best learn cheerfulness, patience,\r\nself-control, and the spirit of service and of duty. The home is the\r\ntrue school of courtesy, of which woman is always the best practical\r\ninstructor. \"Without woman,\" says the Provencal proverb, \"men were\r\nbut ill-licked cubs.\" Philanthropy radiates from the home as from a\r\ncenter. \"To love the little platoon we belong to in society,\" said\r\nBurke, \"is the germ of all public affections.\" The wisest and best\r\nhave not been ashamed to own it to be their greatest joy and happiness\r\nto sit \"behind the heads of children\" in the inviolable circle of\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DAY DREAMING.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO YOUNG WOMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. TO BE A WOMAN, in the truest and highest sense of the word is to be\r\nthe best thing beneath the skies. To be a woman is something more than\r\nto live eighteen or twenty years; something more than to grow to\r\nthe physical stature of women; something more than to wear flounces,\r\nexhibit dry goods, sport jewelry, catch the gaze of lewd-eyed men;\r\nsomething more than to be a belle, a wife, or a mother. Put all these\r\nqualifications together and they do but little toward making a true\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n2. BEAUTY AND STYLE are not the surest passports to womanhood--some of\r\nthe noblest specimens of womanhood that the world has ever seen have\r\npresented the plainest and most unprepossessing appearance. A woman's\r\nworth is to be estimated by the real goodness of her heart, the\r\ngreatness of her soul, and the purity and sweetness of her character;\r\nand a woman with a kindly disposition and well-balanced temper is both\r\nlovely and attractive, be her face ever so plain, and her figure ever\r\nso homely; she makes the best of wives and the truest of mothers.\r\n\r\n3. BEAUTY IS A DANGEROUS GIFT.--It is even so. Like wealth, it has\r\nruined its thousands. Thousands of the most beautiful women are\r\ndestitute of common sense and common humanity. No gift from heaven\r\nis so general and so widely abused by woman as the gift of beauty. In\r\nabout nine cases in ten it makes her silly, senseless, thoughtless,\r\ngiddy, vain, proud, frivolous, selfish, low and mean. I think I have\r\nseen more girls spoiled by beauty than by any other one thing, \"She\r\nis beautiful, and she knows it,\" is as much as to say that she is\r\nspoiled. A beautiful girl is very likely to believe she was made to be\r\nlooked at; and so she sets herself up for a show at every window, in\r\nevery door, on every corner of the street, in every company at which\r\nopportunity offers for an exhibition of herself.\r\n\r\n4. BEWARE OF BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.--These facts have long since taught\r\nsensible men to beware of beautiful women--to sound them carefully\r\nbefore they give them their confidence. Beauty is shallow--only skin\r\ndeep; fleeting--only for a few years' reign; dangerous--tempting to\r\nvanity and lightness of mind; deceitful--dazzling of ten to bewilder;\r\nweak--reigning only to ruin; gross--leading often to sensual pleasure.\r\nAnd yet we say it need not be so. Beauty is lovely and ought to be\r\ninnocently possessed. It has charms which ought to be used for good\r\npurposes. It is a delightful gift, which ought to be received with\r\ngratitude and worn with grace and meekness. It should always minister\r\nto inward beauty. Every woman of beautiful form and features should\r\ncultivate a beautiful mind and heart.\r\n\r\n5. RIVAL THE BOYS.--We want the girls to rival the boys in all that is\r\ngood, and refined, and ennobling. We want them to rival the boys, as\r\nthey well can, in learning, in understanding, in virtues; in all noble\r\nqualities of mind and heart, but not in any of those things that have\r\ncaused them, justly or unjustly, to be described as savages. We\r\nwant the girls to be gentle--not weak, but gentle, and kind and\r\naffectionate. We want to be sure, that wherever a girl is, there\r\nshould be a sweet, subduing and harmonizing influence of purity,\r\nand truth, and love, pervading and hallowing, from center to\r\ncircumference, the entire circle in which she moves. If the boys are\r\nsavages, we want her to be their civilizer. We want her to tame them,\r\nto subdue their ferocity, to soften their manners, and to teach them\r\nall needful lessons of order, sobriety, and meekness, and patience and\r\ngoodness.\r\n\r\n6. KINDNESS.--Kindness is the ornament of man--it is the chief glory\r\nof woman--it is, indeed, woman's true prerogative--her sceptre and\r\nher crown. It is the sword with which she conquers, and the charm with\r\nwhich she captivates.\r\n\r\n7. ADMIRED AND BELOVED.--Young lady, would you be admired and beloved?\r\nWould you be an ornament to your sex, and a blessing to your race?\r\nCultivate this heavenly virtue. Wealth may surround you with its\r\nblandishments, and beauty, and learning, or talents, may give you\r\nadmirers, but love and kindness alone can captivate the heart. Whether\r\nyou live in a cottage or a palace, these graces can surround you with\r\nperpetual sunshine, making you, and all around you, happy.\r\n\r\n8. INWARD GRACE.--Seek ye then, fair daughters, the possession of\r\nthat inward grace, whose essence shall permeate and vitalize the\r\naffections, adorn the countenance make mellifluous the voice, and\r\nimpart a hallowed beauty even to your motions. Not merely that you\r\nmay be loved, would I urge this, but that you may, in truth, be\r\nlovely--that loveliness which fades not with time, nor is marred or\r\nalienated by disease, but which neither chance nor change can in any\r\nway despoil.\r\n\r\n9. SILKEN ENTICEMENTS OF THE STRANGER.--We urge you, gentle maiden, to\r\nbeware of the silken enticements of the stranger, until your love\r\nis confirmed by protracted acquaintance. Shun the idler, though his\r\ncoffers overflow with pelf. Avoid the irreverent--the scoffer of\r\nhallowed things; and him who \"looks upon the wine while it is red;\"\r\nhim too, \"who hath a high look and a proud heart,\" and who \"privily\r\nslandereth his neighbor.\" Do not heed the specious prattle about\r\n\"first love,\" and so place, irrevocably, the seal upon your future\r\ndestiny, before you have sounded, in silence and secrecy, the deep\r\nfountains of your own heart. Wait, rather, until your own character\r\nand that of him who would woo you, is more fully developed. Surely, if\r\nthis \"first love\" cannot endure a short probation, fortified by\r\n\"the pleasures of hope,\" how can it be expected to survive years of\r\nintimacy, scenes of trial, distracting cares, wasting sickness,\r\nand all the homely routine of practical life? Yet it is these that\r\nconstitute life, and the love that cannot abide them is false and must\r\ndie.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROMAN LADIES.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF FEMALE CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. MORAL EFFECT.--It is in its moral effect on the mind and the heart\r\nof man, that the influence of woman is most powerful and important. In\r\nthe diversity of tastes, habits, inclinations, and pursuits of the two\r\nsexes, is found a most beneficent provision for controlling the force\r\nand extravagance of human passion. The objects which most strongly\r\nseize and stimulate the mind of man, rarely act at the same time and\r\nwith equal power on the mind of woman. She is naturally better, purer,\r\nand more chaste in thought and language.\r\n\r\n2. FEMALE CHARACTER.--But the influence of female character on the\r\nvirtue of men, is not seen merely in restraining and softening the\r\nviolence of human passion. To her is mainly committed the task of\r\npouring into the opening mind of infancy its first impressions of\r\nduty, and of stamping on its susceptible heart the first image of its\r\nGod. Who will not confess the influence of a mother in forming the\r\nheart of a child? What man is there who can not trace the origin of\r\nmany of the best maxims of his life to the lips of her who gave him\r\nbirth? How wide, how lasting, how sacred is that part of a woman's\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\n3. VIRTUE OF A COMMUNITY.--There is yet another mode by which woman\r\nmay exert a powerful influence on the virtue of a community. It rests\r\nwith her in a pre-eminent degree, to give tone and elevation to the\r\nmoral character of the age, by deciding the degree of virtue that\r\nshall be necessary to afford a passport to her society. If all the\r\nfavor of woman were given only to the good, if it were known that the\r\ncharms and attractions of beauty and wisdom, and wit, were reserved\r\nonly for the pure; if, in one word, something of a similar rigor were\r\nexerted to exclude the profligate and abandoned of society, as is\r\nshown to those, who have fallen from virtue,--how much would be done\r\nto re-enforce the motives to moral purity among us, and impress on the\r\nminds of all a reverence for the sanctity and obligations of virtue.\r\n\r\n4. THE INFLUENCE OF WOMAN ON THE MORAL SENTIMENTS.--The influence of\r\nwoman on the moral sentiments of society is intimately connected with\r\nher influence on its religious character; for religion and a pure and\r\nelevated morality must ever stand in the relation to each other of\r\neffect and cause. The heart of a woman is formed for the abode of\r\nsacred truth; and for the reasons alike honorable to her character and\r\nto that of society. From the nature of humanity this must be so, or\r\nthe race would soon degenerate and moral contagion eat out the heart\r\nof society. The purity of home is the safeguard to American manhood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPERSONAL PURITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control,\r\n  These three alone lead life to sovereign power.\"--Tennyson\r\n\r\n\r\n1. WORDS OF THE GREAT TEACHER.--Mark the words of the Great Teacher:\r\n\"If thy right hand or foot cause thee to fall, cut it off and cast it\r\nfrom thee. If thy right eye cause thee to fall, pluck it out. It is\r\nbetter for thee to enter into life maimed and halt, than having two\r\neyes to be cast into hell-fire, where the worm dieth not, and the fire\r\nis not quenched.\"\r\n\r\n2. A MELANCHOLY FACT.--It is a melancholy fact in human experience,\r\nthat the noblest gifts which men possess are constantly prostituted\r\nto other purposes than those for which they are designed. The most\r\nvaluable and useful organs of the body are those which are capable\r\nof the greatest dishonor, abuse, and corruption. What a snare the\r\nwonderful organism of the eye may become, when used to read corrupt\r\nbooks, or to look upon licentious pictures, or vulgar theater scenes,\r\nor when used to meet the fascinating gaze of the harlot! What an\r\ninstrument for depraving the whole man may be found in the matchless\r\npowers of the brain, the hand, the mouth, or the tongue! What potent\r\ninstruments may these become in accomplishing the ruin of the whole\r\nbeing, for time and eternity!\r\n\r\n3. Abstinence.--Some can testify with thankfulness that they never\r\nknew the sins of gambling, drunkenness, fornication, or adultery. In\r\nall these cases abstinence has been, and continues to be, liberty.\r\nRestraint is the noblest freedom. No man can affirm that self-denial\r\never injured him; on the contrary, self-restraint has been liberty,\r\nstrength and blessing. Solemnly ask young men to remember this when\r\ntemptation and passion strive as a floodtide to move them from the\r\nanchorage and peace of self-restraint. Beware of the deceitful stream\r\nof temporary gratification, whose eddying current drifts towards\r\nlicense, shame, disease and death. Remember how quickly moral power\r\ndeclines, how rapidly the edge of the fatal maelstrom is reached, how\r\nnear the vortex, how terrible the penalty, how fearful the sentence of\r\neverlasting punishment!\r\n\r\n4. FRANK DISCUSSION.--The time has arrived for a full and frank\r\ndiscussion of those things which affect the personal purity. Thousands\r\nare suffering to-day from various weaknesses, the causes of which they\r\nhave never learned. Manly vigor is not increasing with that rapidity\r\nwhich a Christian age demands. Means of dissipation are on the\r\nincrease. It is high time, therefore, that every lover of the\r\nrace should call a halt, and inquire into the condition of things.\r\nExcessive modesty on this subject is not virtue. Timidity in\r\npresenting unpleasant but important truths has permitted untold damage\r\nin every age.\r\n\r\n5. MAN IS A CARELESS BEING.--He is very much inclined to sinful\r\nthings. He more often does that which is wrong than that which is\r\nright, because it is easier, and, for the moment, perhaps, more\r\nsatisfying to the flesh. The Creator is often blamed for man's\r\nweaknesses and inconsistencies. This is wrong. God did not intend that\r\nwe should be mere machines, but free moral agents. We are privileged\r\nto choose between good and evil. Hence, if we perseveringly choose\r\nthe latter, and make a miserable failure of life, we should blame only\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\n6. THE PULPIT.--Would that every pulpit in the land might join hands\r\nwith the medical profession and cry out with no uncertain sound\r\nagainst the mighty evils herein stigmatized! It would work a\r\nrevolution for which coming society could never cease to be grateful.\r\n\r\n7. STRIVE TO ATTAIN A HIGHER LIFE.--Strive to attain unto a higher\r\nand better life. Beware of all excesses, of whatever nature, and guard\r\nyour personal purity with sacred determination. Let every aspiration\r\nbe upward, and be strong in every good, resolution. Seek the light,\r\nfor in light there is life, while in darkness there is decay and\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST LOVE LETTER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHOW TO WRITE ALL KINDS OF LETTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. From the President in his cabinet to the laborer in the street;\r\nfrom the lady in her parlor to the servant in her kitchen; from the\r\nmillionaire to the beggar; from the emigrant to the settler; from\r\nevery country and under every combination of circumstances, letter\r\nwriting in all its forms and varieties is most important to the\r\nadvancement, welfare and happiness of the human family.\r\n\r\n2. EDUCATION.--The art of conveying thought through the medium of\r\nwritten language is so valuable and so necessary, a thorough knowledge\r\nof the practice must be desirable to every one. For merely to write a\r\ngood letter requires the exercise of much of the education and talent\r\nof any writer.\r\n\r\n3. A GOOD LETTER.--A good letter must be correct in every mechanical\r\ndetail, finished in style, interesting in substance, and intelligible\r\nin construction. Few there are who do not need write them; yet\r\na letter perfect in detail is rarer than any other specimen of\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\n4. PENMANSHIP.--It is folly to suppose that the faculty for writing a\r\ngood hand is confined to any particular persons. There is no one who\r\ncan write at all, but what can write well, if only the necessary pains\r\nare practiced. Practice makes perfect. Secure a few copy books and\r\nwrite an hour each day. You will soon write a good hand.\r\n\r\n5. WRITE PLAINLY.--Every word of even the most trifling document\r\nshould be written in such clear characters that it would be impossible\r\nto mistake it for another word, or the writer may find himself in the\r\nposition of the Eastern merchant who, writing to the Indies for five\r\nthousand mangoes, received by the next vessel five hundred monkies,\r\nwith a promise of more in the next cargo.\r\n\r\n6. HASTE.--Hurry is no excuse for bad writing, because any one of\r\nsense knows that everything hurried is liable to be ruined. Dispatch\r\nmay be acquired, but hurry will ruin everything. If, however, you must\r\nwrite slowly to write well, then be careful not to hurry at all, for\r\nthe few moments you will gain by rapid writing will never compensate\r\nyou for the disgrace of sending an ill-written letter.\r\n\r\n7. NEATNESS.--Neatness is also of great importance. A fair white sheet\r\nwith handsomely written words will be more welcome to any reader than\r\na blotted, bedaubed page covered with erasures and dirt, even if\r\nthe matter in each be of equal value and interest. Erasures, blots,\r\ninterlineations always spoil the beauty of any letter.\r\n\r\n8. BAD SPELLING.--When those who from faulty education, or\r\nforgetfulness are doubtful about the correct spelling of any word,\r\nit is best to keep a dictionary at hand, and refer to it upon such\r\noccasions. It is far better to spend a few moments in seeking for a\r\ndoubtful word, than to dispatch an ill-spelled letter, and the\r\nsearch will probably impress the spelling upon the mind for a future\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n9. CARELESSNESS.--Incorrect spelling will expose the most important\r\nor interesting letter to the severest sarcasm and ridicule. However\r\nperfect in all other respects, no epistle that is badly spelled will\r\nbe regarded as the work of an educated gentleman or lady. Carelessness\r\nwill never be considered, and to be ignorant of spelling is to expose\r\nan imperfect education at once.\r\n\r\n10. AN EXCELLENT PRACTICE.--After writing a letter, read it over\r\ncarefully, correct all the errors and re-write it. If you desire to\r\nbecome a good letter writer, improve your penmanship, improve your\r\nlanguage and grammar, re-writing once or twice every letter that you\r\nhave occasion to write, whether on social or business subjects.\r\n\r\n11. PUNCTUATION.--A good rule for punctuation is to punctuate where\r\nthe sense requires it, after writing a letter and reading it over\r\ncarefully you will see where the punctuation marks are required, you\r\ncan readily determine where the sense requires it, so that your letter\r\nwill convey the desired meaning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n12. CORRESPONDENCE.--There is no better school or better source for\r\nself-improvement than a pleasant correspondence between friends. It\r\nis not at all difficult to secure a good list of correspondents if\r\ndesired. The young people who take advantage of such opportunities\r\nfor self-improvement will be much more popular in the community and in\r\nsociety. Letter writing cultivates the habit of study; it cultivates\r\nthe mind, the heart, and stimulates self-improvement in general.\r\n\r\n13. FOLDING.--Another bad practice with those unaccustomed to\r\ncorresponding is to fold the sheet of writing in such a fantastic\r\nmanner as to cause the receiver much annoyance in opening it. To the\r\nsender it may appear a very ingenious performance, but to the receiver\r\nit is only a source of vexation and annoyance, and may prevent the\r\ncommunication receiving the attention it would otherwise merit.\r\n\r\n14. SIMPLE STYLE.--The style of letter writing should be simple and\r\nunaffected, not raised on stilts and indulging in pedantic displays\r\nwhich are mostly regarded as cloaks of ignorance. Repeated literary\r\nquotations, involved sentences, long-sounding words and scraps of\r\nLatin, French and other languages are, generally speaking, out of\r\nplace, and should not be indulged in.\r\n\r\n15. THE RESULT.--A well written letter has opened the way to\r\nprosperity for many a one, has led to many a happy marriage and\r\nconstant friendship, and has secured many a good service in time of\r\nneed; for it is in some measure a photograph of the writer, and may\r\ninspire love or hatred, regard or aversion in the reader, just as\r\nthe glimpse of a portrait often determine us, in our estimate, of\r\nthe worth of the person represented. Therefore, one of the roads\r\nto fortune runs through the ink bottle, and if we want to attain a\r\ncertain end in love, friendship or business, we must trace out the\r\nroute correctly with the pen in our hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHOW TO WRITE A LOVE LETTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. LOVE.--There is no greater or more profound reality than love. Why\r\nthat reality should be obscured by mere sentimentalism, with all\r\nits train of absurdities is incomprehensible. There is no nobler\r\npossession than the love of another. There is no higher gift from one\r\nhuman being to another than love. The gift and the possession are true\r\nsanctifiers of life, and should be worn as precious jewels, without\r\naffectation and without bashfulness. For this reason there is nothing\r\nto be ashamed of in a love letter, provided it be sincere.\r\n\r\n2. FORFEITS.--No man need consider that he forfeits dignity if he\r\nspeaks with his whole heart: no woman need fear she forfeits her\r\nwomanly attributes if she responds as her heart bids her respond.\r\n\"Perfect love casteth out fear\" is as true now as when the maxim was\r\nfirst given to the world.\r\n\r\n3. TELLING THEIR LOVE.--The generality of the sex is, love to be\r\nloved; how are they to know the fact that they are loved unless they\r\nare told? To write a sensible love letter requires more talent than\r\nto solve, with your pen, a profound problem in philosophy. Lovers must\r\nnot then expect much from each other's epistles.\r\n\r\n4. CONFIDENTIAL.--Ladies and gentlemen who correspond with each other\r\nshould never be guilty of exposing any of the contents of any letters\r\nwritten expressing confidence, attachment or love. The man who\r\nconfides in a lady and honors her with his confidence should be\r\ntreated with perfect security and respect, and those who delight in\r\nshowing their confidential letters to others are unworthy, heartless\r\nand unsafe companions.\r\n\r\n5. RETURN OF LETTERS.--If letters were written under circumstances\r\nwhich no longer exist and all confidential relations are at an end,\r\nthen all letters should be promptly returned.\r\n\r\n6. HOW TO BEGIN A LOVE LETTER.--How to begin a love letter has been no\r\ndoubt the problem of lovers and suitors of all ages and nations. Fancy\r\nthe youth of Young America with lifted pen, thinking how he shall\r\naddress his beloved. Much depends upon this letter. What shall he say,\r\nand how shall he say it, is the great question. Perseverance, however,\r\nwill solve the problem and determine results.\r\n\r\n7. FORMS OF BEGINNING A LOVE LETTER.--Never say, \"My Dearest Nellie,\"\r\n\"My Adored Nellie,\" or \"My Darling Nellie,\" until Nellie has first\r\ncalled you \"My Dear,\" or has given you to understand that such\r\nfamiliar terms are permissible. As a rule a gentleman will never\r\nerr if he says \"Dear Miss Nellie,\" and if the letters are cordially\r\nreciprocated the \"Miss\" may in time be omitted, or other familiar\r\nterms used instead. In addressing a widow \"Dear Madam,\" or, \"My Dear\r\nMadam,\" will be a proper form until sufficient intimacy will justify\r\nthe use of other terms.\r\n\r\n8. RESPECT.--A lady must always be treated with respectful delicacy,\r\nand a gentleman should never use the term \"Dear\" or \"My Dear\" under\r\nany circumstances unless he knows it is perfectly acceptable or a long\r\nand friendly acquaintance justifies it.\r\n\r\n9. HOW TO FINISH A LETTER.--A letter will be suggested by the remarks\r\non how to begin one. \"Yours respectfully,\" \"Yours truly,\" \"Yours\r\nsincerely,\" \"Yours affectionately,\" \"Yours ever affectionately,\"\r\n\"Yours most affectionately,\" \"Ever yours,\" \"Ever your own,\" or\r\n\"Yours,\" are all appropriate, each depending upon the beginning of the\r\nletter. It is difficult to see any phrase which could be added to\r\nthem which would carry more meaning than they contain. People can sign\r\nthemselves \"adorers\" and such like, but they do so at the peril of\r\ngood taste. It is not good that men or women \"worship\" each other--if\r\nthey succeed in preserving reciprocal love and esteem they will have\r\ncause for great contentment.\r\n\r\n10. PERMISSION.--No young man should ever write to a young lady any\r\nletter, formal or informal, unless he has first sought her permission\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\n11. SPECIAL FORMS.--We give various forms or models of love letters to\r\nbe _studied, not copied._ We have given no replies to the forms given,\r\nas every letter written will naturally suggest an answer. A careful\r\nstudy will be a great help to many who have not enjoyed the advantages\r\nof a literary education.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFORMS OF SOCIAL LETTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_1.--From a Young Lady to a Clergyman Asking a Recommendation._\r\n\r\n    Nantwich, May 18th, 1915\r\n\r\n    Reverend and Dear Sir:\r\n\r\n    Having seen an advertisment for a school mistress in the Daily\r\n    Times, I have been recommended to offer myself as a candidate.\r\n    Will you kindly favor me with a testimonial as to my\r\n    character, ability and conduct while at Boston Normal School?\r\n    Should you consider that I am fitted for the position,\r\n    you would confer a great favor on me if you would interest\r\n    yourself in my behalf.\r\n\r\n    I remain, Reverend Sir,\r\n    Your most obedient and humble servant,\r\n    LAURA B.

I was on my way to your house, with the\r\n    assurance of a pleasant evening, when unfortunately I was very\r\n    unexpectedly called from home on very important business.\r\n\r\n    I regret my disappointment, but hope that the future may\r\n    afford us many pleasant meetings.\r\n\r\n    Sincerely your friend,\r\n    IRVING GOODRICH.\r\n\r\n\r\n_8.--Form of an Excuse for a Pupil._\r\n\r\n    Thursday Morning, April 4th\r\n\r\n    Mr. Bunnel:\r\n\r\n    You will please excuse William for non-attendance at school\r\n    yesterday, as I was compelled to keep him at home to attend to\r\n    a matter of business. MRS. A. SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\n_9.--Form of Letter Accompanying a Present._\r\n\r\n    Louisville, July 6, 1895\r\n\r\n    My Dearest Nelly:\r\n\r\n    Many happy returns of the day. So fearful was I that it would\r\n    escape your memory, that I thought I would send you this\r\n    little trinket by way of reminder, I beg you to accept it and\r\n    wear it for the sake of the giver. With love and best wishes.\r\n\r\n    Believe me ever, your sincere friend,\r\n    CAROLINE COLLINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_10.--Returning Thanks for the Present._\r\n\r\n    Louisville, July 6, 1894.\r\n\r\n    Dear Mrs. Collins:\r\n\r\n    I am very much obliged to you for the handsome bracelet\r\n    you have sent me. How kind and thoughtful it was of you to\r\n    remember me on my birthday. I am sure I have every cause to\r\n    bless the day, and did I forget it, I have many kind friends\r\n    to remind me of it. Again thanking you for your present, which\r\n    is far too beautiful for me, and also for your kind wishes.\r\n\r\n    Believe me, your most grateful,\r\n    BERTHA SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\n_11.--Congratulating a Friend Upon His Marriage._\r\n\r\n    Menton, N.Y., May 24th, 1894.\r\n\r\n    My Dear Everett:\r\n\r\n    I have, to-day received the invitation to your wedding, and\r\n    as I cannot be present at that happy event to offer my\r\n    congratulations in person, I write.\r\n\r\n    I am heartily glad you are going to be married, and\r\n    congratulate you upon the wisdom of your choice. You have won\r\n    a noble as well as a beautiful woman, and one whose love will\r\n    make you a happy man to your life's end. May God grant that\r\n    trouble may not come near you but should it be your lot, you\r\n    will have a wife to whom you can look with confidence for\r\n    comfort, and whose good sense and devotion to you will be your\r\n    sure and unfailing support.\r\n\r\n    That you may both be very happy, and that your happiness may\r\n    increase with your years, is the prayer of\r\n\r\n    Your Friend, FRANK HOWARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLETTER WRITING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny extravagant flattery should be avoided, both as tending to disgust\r\nthose to whom it is addressed, as well as to degrade the writers,\r\nand to create suspicion as to their sincerity. The sentiments should\r\nspring from the tenderness of the heart, and, when faithfully and\r\ndelicately expressed, will never be read without exciting sympathy or\r\nemotion in all hearts not absolutely deadened by insensibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECLARATION OF AFFECTION.\r\n\r\n    Dear Nellie: Will you allow me, in a few plain and simple\r\n    words, respectfully to express the sincere esteem and\r\n    affection I entertain for you, and to ask whether I may\r\n    venture to hope that these sentiments are returned? I love\r\n    you truly and earnestly and knowing you admire frankness\r\n    and candor in all things, I cannot think that you will take\r\n    offense at this letter. Perhaps it is self-flattery to suppose\r\n    I have any place in your regard. Should this be so, the error\r\n    will carry with it its own punishment, for my happy dream will\r\n    be over. I will try to think otherwise, however, and shall\r\n    await your answer with hope. Trusting soon to hear from you, I\r\n    remain, dear Nellie.\r\n\r\n    Sincerely Yours,\r\n    J.L. Master\r\n\r\n    To Miss Nellie Reynolds,\r\n    Hartford, Conn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFORMS OF LOVE LETTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_12.--An Ardent Declaration._\r\n\r\n    Naperville, Ill., June 10th, 1915\r\n\r\n    My Dearest Laura:\r\n\r\n    I can no longer restrain myself from writing to you, dearest\r\n    and best of girls, what I have often been on the point of\r\n    saying to you. I love you so much that I cannot find words in\r\n    which to express my feelings. I have loved you from the very\r\n    first day we met, and always shall. Do you blame me because I\r\n    write so freely? I should be unworthy of you if I did not tell\r\n    you the whole truth. Oh, Laura, can you love me in return?\r\n    I am sure I shall not be able to bear it if your answer is\r\n    unfavorable. I will study your every wish if you will give\r\n    me the right to do so. May I hope? Send just one kind word to\r\n    your sincere friend.\r\n\r\n    HARRY SMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\n_13.--A Lover's Good-bye Before Starting on a Journey._\r\n\r\n    Pearl St., New York, March 11th, 1894.\r\n\r\n    My Dearest Nellie: I am off to-morrow, and yet not altogether,\r\n    for I leave my heart behind in your gentle keeping. You need\r\n    not place a guard over it, however, for it is as impossible\r\n    that it should stay away, as for a bit of steel to rush from a\r\n    magnet. The simile is eminently correct for you, my dear girl,\r\n    are a magnet, and my heart is as true to you as steel. I shall\r\n    make my absence as brief as possible. Not a day, not an hour,\r\n    not a minute, shall I waste either in going or returning. Oh,\r\n    this business; but I wont complain, for we must have something\r\n    for our hive besides honey--something that rhymes with it--and\r\n    that we must have it, I must bestir myself. You will find me\r\n    a faithful correspondent. Like the spider, I shall drop a line\r\n    by (almost) every post; and mind, you must give me letter for\r\n    letter. I can't give you credit. Your returns must be prompt\r\n    and punctual.\r\n\r\n    Passionately yours,\r\n    LEWIS SHUMAN.\r\n\r\n    To Miss Nellie Carter,\r\n    No. -- Fifth Avenue, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n_14.--From an Absent Lover._\r\n\r\n    Chicago, Ill., Sept. 10, 1915\r\n\r\n    My Dearest Kate: This sheet of paper, though I should cover\r\n    it with loving words, could never tell you truly how I long\r\n    to see you again. Time does not run on with me now at the\r\n    same pace as with other people; the hours seem days, the days\r\n    weeks, while I am absent from you, and I have no faith in the\r\n    accuracy of clocks and almanacs. Ah! if there were truth in\r\n    clairvoyance, wouldn't I be with you at this moment! I wonder\r\n    if you are as impatient to see me as I am to fly to you?\r\n    Sometimes it seems as if I must leave business and every\r\n    thing else to the Fates, and take the first train to Dawson.\r\n    However, the hours do move, though they don't appear to, and\r\n    in a few more weeks we shall meet again. Let me hear from you\r\n    as frequently as possible in the meantime. Tell me of your\r\n    health, your amusements and your affections.\r\n\r\n    Remember that every word you write will be a comfort to me.\r\n\r\n    Unchangeably yours,\r\n    WILLIAM MILLER.\r\n\r\n    To Miss Kate Martin,\r\n    Dawson, N.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n_15.--A Declaration of Love at First Sight._\r\n\r\n    Waterford, Maine, May 8th, 1915\r\n\r\n    Dear Miss Searles:\r\n\r\n    Although I have been in your society but once the impression\r\n    you have made upon me is so deep and powerful that I cannot\r\n    forbear writing to you, in defiance of all rules of etiquette.\r\n    Affection is sometimes of slow growth but sometimes it springs\r\n    up in a moment. In half an hour after I was introduced to you\r\n    my heart was no longer my own, I have not the assurance\r\n    to suppose that I have been fortunate enough to create any\r\n    interest in yours; but will you allow me to cultivate your\r\n    acquaintance in the hope or being able to win your regard in\r\n    the course of time? Petitioning for a few lines in reply.\r\n\r\n    I remain, dear Miss Searles,\r\n    Yours devotedly,\r\n    E.C. NICKS.\r\n\r\n    Miss E. Searles,\r\n    Waterford, Maine.\r\n\r\n\r\n_16.--Proposing Marriage._\r\n\r\n    Wednesday, October 20th, 1894\r\n\r\n    Dearest Etta:\r\n\r\n    The delightful hours I have passed in your society have left\r\n    an impression on my mind that is altogether indelible,\r\n    and cannot be effaced even by time itself. The frequent\r\n    opportunities I have possessed, of observing the thousand acts\r\n    of amiability and kindness which mark the daily tenor of your\r\n    life, have ripened my feelings of affectionate regard into\r\n    a passion at once ardent and sincere until I have at length\r\n    associated my hopes of future happiness with the idea of you\r\n    as a life partner, in them. Believe me, dearest Etta, this is\r\n    no puerile fancy, but the matured results of a long and warmly\r\n    cherished admiration of your many charms of person and mind.\r\n    It is love--pure devoted love, and I feel confident that your\r\n    knowledge of my character will lead you to ascribe my motives\r\n    to their true source.\r\n\r\n    May I then implore you to consult your own heart, and should\r\n    this avowal of my fervent and honorable passion for you\r\n    be crowned with your acceptance and approval, to grant me\r\n    permission to refer the matter to your parents. Anxiously\r\n    awaiting your answer,\r\n\r\n    I am, dearest Etta,\r\n    Your sincere and faithful lover,\r\n    GEO. COURTRIGHT.\r\n\r\n    To Miss Etta Jay,\r\n    Malden, Ill.\r\n\r\n\r\n_17.--From a Gentleman to a Widow._\r\n\r\n    Philadelphia, May 10th, 1915\r\n\r\n    My Dear Mrs. Freeman:\r\n\r\n    I am sure you are too clear-sighted not to have observed the\r\n    profound impression which your amiable qualities, intelligence\r\n    and personal attractions have made upon my heart, and as you\r\n    nave not repelled my attentions nor manifested displeasure\r\n    when I ventured to hint at the deep interest I felt in your\r\n    welfare and happiness, I cannot help hoping that you will\r\n    receive an explicit expression of my attachments, kindly and\r\n    favorably. I wish it were in my power to clothe the feelings\r\n    I entertain for you in such words as should make my pleadings\r\n    irresistible; but, after all, what could I say, more than you\r\n    are very dear to me, and that the most earnest desire of my\r\n    soul is to have the privilege of calling you my wife? Do\r\n    you, can you love me? You will not, I am certain, keep me in\r\n    suspense, for you are too good and kind to trifle for a moment\r\n    with sincerity like mine. Awaiting your answer,\r\n\r\n    I remain with respectful affection,\r\n    Ever yours,\r\n    HENRY MURRAY.\r\n\r\n    Mrs. Julia Freeman,\r\n    Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_18.--From a Lady to an Inconstant Lover._\r\n\r\n    Dear Harry:\r\n\r\n    It is with great reluctance that I enter upon a subject which\r\n    has given me great pain, and upon which silence has become\r\n    impossible if I would preserve my self-respects. You cannot\r\n    but be aware that I have just reason for saying that you have\r\n    much displeased me. You have apparently forgotten what is due\r\n    to me, circumstanced as we are, thus far at least. You cannot\r\n    suppose that I can tamely see you disregard my feelings, by\r\n    conduct toward other ladies from which I should naturally\r\n    have the right to expect you to abstain. I am not so vulgar a\r\n    person as to be jealous. When there is cause to infer changed\r\n    feelings, or unfaithfulness to promises of constancy, jealousy\r\n    is not the remedy. What the remedy is I need not say--we both\r\n    of us have it in our hands. I am sure you will agree with me\r\n    that we must come to some understanding by which the future\r\n    shall be governed. Neither you nor I can bear a divided\r\n    allegiance. Believe me that I write more in sorrow than\r\n    in anger. You have made me very unhappy, and perhaps\r\n    thoughtlessly. But it will take much to reassure me of your\r\n    unaltered regard.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly,\r\n    EMMA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEALTHFUL OUTDOOR EXERCISE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HUMAN FACE, LIKE A FLOWER, SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHINTS AND HELPS ON GOOD BEHAVIOR AT ALL TIMES AND AT ALL PLACES.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. It takes acquaintance to found a noble esteem, but politeness\r\nprepares the way. Indeed, as ontaigne [Transcriber's note: Montaigne?]\r\nsays, Courtesy begets esteem at sight. Urbanity is half of affability,\r\nand affability is a charm worth possessing.\r\n\r\n2. A pleasing demeanor is often the scales by which the pagan weighs\r\nthe Christian. It is not virtue, but virtue inspires it. There are\r\ncircumstances in which it takes a great and strong soul to pass under\r\nthe little yoke of courtesy, but it is a passport to a greater soul\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\n3. Matthew Arnold says, \"Conduct is three-fourths of character,\"\r\nand Christian benignity draws the line for conduct. A high sense of\r\nrectitude, a lowly soul, with a pure and kind heart are elements\r\nof nobility which will work out in the life of a human being at\r\nhome--everywhere. \"Private refinement makes public gentility.\"\r\n\r\n4. If you would conciliate the favor of men, rule your resentment.\r\nRemember that if you permit revenge or malice to occupy your soul, you\r\nare ruined.\r\n\r\n5. Cultivate a happy temper; banish the blues; a cheerful saguine\r\nspirit begets cheer and hope.\r\n\r\n6. Be trustworthy and be trustful.\r\n\r\n7. Do not place a light estimate upon the arts of good reading and\r\ngood expression; they will yield perpetual interest.\r\n\r\n8. Study to keep versed in world events as well as in local\r\noccurrences, but abhor gossip, and above all scandal.\r\n\r\n9. Banish a self-conscience spirit--the source of much\r\nawkwardness--with a constant aim to make others happy. Remember that\r\nit is incumbent upon gentlemen and ladies alike to be neat in habits.\r\n\r\n10. The following is said to be a correct posture for walking: Head\r\nerect--not too rigid--chin in, shoulders back. Permit no unnecessary\r\nmotion about the thighs. Do not lean over to one side in walking,\r\nstanding or sitting; the practice is not only ungraceful, but it is\r\ndeforming and therefore unhealthful.\r\n\r\n11. Beware of affectation and of Beau Brummel airs.\r\n\r\n12. If the hands are allowed to swing in walking, the are should be\r\nlimited, and the lady will manage them much more gracefully, if they\r\nalmost touch the clothing.\r\n\r\n13. A lady should not stand with her hands behind her. We could almost\r\nsay, forget the hands except to keep them clean, including the nails,\r\ncordial and helpful. One hand may rest easily in the other. Study\r\nrepose of attitude here as well as in the rest of the body.\r\n\r\n14. Gestures are for emphasis in public speaking; do not point\r\nelsewhere, as a rule.\r\n\r\n15. Greet your acquaintances as you meet them with a slight bow and\r\nsmile, as you speak.\r\n\r\n16. Look the person to whom you speak in the eye. Never under any\r\ncircumstances wink at another or communicate by furtive looks.\r\n\r\n17. Should you chance to be the rejected suitor of a lady, bear in\r\nmind your own self-respect, as well as the inexorable laws of society,\r\nand bow politely when you meet her. Reflect that you do not stand\r\nbefore all woman-kind as you do at her bar. Do not resent the\r\nbitterness of flirtation. No lady or gentleman will flirt. Remember\r\never that painful prediscovery is better than later disappointment.\r\nLet such experience spur you to higher exertion.\r\n\r\n18. Discretion should be exercised in introducing persons. Of two\r\ngentlemen who are introduced, if one is superior in rank or age, he is\r\nthe one to whom the introduction should be made. Of two social equals,\r\nif one be a stranger in the place his name should be mentioned first.\r\n\r\n19. In general the simpler the introduction the better.\r\n\r\n20. Before introducing a gentleman to a lady, remember that she is\r\nentitled to hold you responsible for the acquaintance. The lady is the\r\none to whom the gentleman is presented, which may be done thus: \"Miss\r\nA, permit me to introduce to you my friend, Mr. B.\"; or, \"Miss A.,\r\nallow me to introduce Mr. B.\" If mutual and near friends of yours, say\r\nsimply, \"Miss A. Mr. B.\"\r\n\r\n21. Receive the introduction with a slight bow and the acknowledgment,\r\n\"Miss A., I am happy to make your acquaintance\"; or, \"Mr. B., I\r\nam pleased to meet you.\" There is no reason why such stereotyped\r\nexpressions should always be used, but something similar is expected.\r\nDo not extend the hand usually.\r\n\r\n22. A true lady will avoid familiarity in her deportment towards\r\ngentlemen. A young lady should not permit her gentlemen friends to\r\naddress her by her home name, and the reverse is true. Use the title\r\nMiss and Mr. respectively.\r\n\r\n23. Ladies should be frank and cordial towards their lady friends, but\r\nnever gushing.\r\n\r\n24. Should you meet a friend twice or oftener, at short intervals, it\r\nis polite to bow slightly each time after the first.\r\n\r\n25. A lady on meeting a gentleman with whom she has slight\r\nacquaintance will make a medium bow--neither too decided nor too\r\nslight or stiff.\r\n\r\n26. For a gentleman to take a young lady's arm, is to intimate that\r\nshe is feeble, and young ladies resent the mode.\r\n\r\n27. If a young lady desires to visit any public place where she\r\nexpects to meet a gentleman acquaintance, she should have a chaperon\r\nto accompany her, a person of mature years When possible, and never a\r\ngiddy girl.\r\n\r\n28. A lady should not ask a gentleman to walk with her.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA COMPLETE ETIQUETTE IN A FEW PRACTICAL RULES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_1. If you desire to be respected, keep clean. The finest attire and\r\ndecorations will add nothing to the appearance or beauty of an untidy\r\nperson._\r\n\r\n_2. Clean clothing, clean skin, clean hands, including the nails, and\r\nclean, white teeth, are a requisite passport for good society._\r\n\r\n_3. A bad breath should be carefully remedied, whether it proceeds\r\nfrom the stomach or from decayed teeth._\r\n\r\n_4. To pick the nose, finger about the ears, or scratch the head or\r\nany other part of the person, in company, is decidedly vulgar._\r\n\r\n_5. When you call at any private residence, do not neglect to clean\r\nyour shoes thoroughly._\r\n\r\n_6. A gentleman should always remove his hat in the presence of\r\nladies, except out of doors, and then he should lift or touch his hat\r\nin salutation. On meeting a lady a well-bred gentleman will always\r\nlift his hat._\r\n\r\n_7. An invitation to a lecture, concert, or other entertainment,\r\nmay be either verbal or written, but should always be made at least\r\ntwenty-four hours before the time._\r\n\r\n_8. On entering a hall or church the gentleman should precede the lady\r\nin walking up the aisle, or walk by her side, if the aisle is broad\r\nenough._\r\n\r\n_9. A gentleman should always precede a lady upstairs, and follow her\r\ndownstairs._\r\n\r\n_10. Visitors should always observe the customs of the church with\r\nreference to standing, sitting, or kneeling during the services._\r\n\r\n_11. On leaving a hall or church at the close of entertainment or\r\nservices, the gentleman should precede the lady._\r\n\r\n_12. A gentleman walking with a lady should carry the parcels, and\r\nnever allow the lady to be burdened with anything of the kind._\r\n\r\n_13. A gentleman meeting a lady on the street and wishing to speak to\r\nher, should never detain her, but may turn around and walk in the same\r\ndirection she is going, until the conversation is completed._\r\n\r\n_14. If a lady is traveling with a gentleman, simply as a friend, she\r\nshould place the amount of her expenses in his hands, or insist on\r\npaying the bills herself._\r\n\r\n_15. Never offer a lady costly gifts unless you are engaged to her,\r\nfor it looks as if you were trying to purchase her good-will; and when\r\nyou make a present to a lady use no ceremony whatever._\r\n\r\n_16. Never carry on a private conversation in company. If secrecy is\r\nnecessary, withdraw from the company._\r\n\r\n_17. Never sit with your back to another without asking to be\r\nexcused._\r\n\r\n_18. It is as unbecoming for a gentleman to sit with legs crossed as\r\nit is for a lady._\r\n\r\n_19. Never thrum with your fingers, rub your hands, yawn or sigh aloud\r\nin company._\r\n\r\n_20. Loud laughter, loud talking, or other boisterous manifestations\r\nshould be checked in the society of others, especially on the street\r\nand in public places._\r\n\r\n_21. When you are asked to sing or play in company, do so without\r\nbeing urged, or refuse in a way that shall be final; and when music is\r\nbeing rendered in company, show politeness to the musician by giving\r\nattention. It is very impolite to keep up a conversation. If you do\r\nnot enjoy the music keep silent._\r\n\r\n_22. Contentions, contradictions, etc. in society should be carefully\r\navoided._\r\n\r\n_23. Pulling out your watch in company, unless asked the time of\r\nday, is a mark of the demi-bred. It looks as if you were tired of the\r\ncompany and the time dragged heavily._\r\n\r\n_24. You should never decline to be introduced to any one or all of\r\nthe guests present at a party to which you have been invited._\r\n\r\n_25. A gentleman who escorts a lady to a party, or who has a lady\r\nplaced under his care, is under particular obligations to attend to\r\nher wants and see that she has proper attention. He should introduce\r\nher to others, and endeavor to make the evening pleasant. He should\r\nescort her to the supper table and provide for her wants._\r\n\r\n_26. To take small children or dogs with you on a visit of ceremony is\r\naltogether vulgar, though in visiting familiar friends, children are\r\nnot objectionable._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Children should early be taught the lesson of Propriety\r\nand Good Manners.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EGYPTIAN BRIDE'S WEDDING OUTFIT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nETIQUETTE OF CALLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the matter of making calls it is the correct thing:\r\n\r\nFor the caller who arrived first to leave first.\r\n\r\nTo return a first call within a week and in person.\r\n\r\nTo call promptly and in person after a first invitation.\r\n\r\nFor the mother or chaperon to invite a gentleman to call.\r\n\r\nTo call within a week after any entertainment to which one has been\r\ninvited.\r\n\r\nYou should call upon an acquaintance who has recently returned from a\r\nprolonged absence.\r\n\r\nIt as proper to make the first call upon people in a higher social\r\nposition, if one is asked to do so.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to call, after an engagement has been announced, or a\r\nmarriage has taken place, in the family.\r\n\r\nFor the older residents in the city or street to call upon the\r\nnewcomers to their neighborhood is a long recognized custom.\r\n\r\nIt is proper, after a removal from one part of the city to another, to\r\nsend out cards with one's new address upon them.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain what are the prescribed hours for calling in the place\r\nwhere one is living, or making a visit, and to adhere to those hours\r\nis a duty that must not be overlooked.\r\n\r\nA gentleman should ask for the lady of the house as well as the young\r\nladies, and leave cards for her as well as for the head of the family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Improve Your Speech by Reading._]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nETIQUETTE IN YOUR SPEECH.\r\n\r\n\r\nDon't say Miss or Mister without the person's name.\r\n\r\nDon't say pants for trousers.\r\n\r\nDon't say gents for gentlemen.\r\n\r\nDon't say female for woman.\r\n\r\nDon't say elegant to mean everything that pleases you.\r\n\r\nDon't say genteel for well-bred.\r\n\r\nDon't say ain't for isn't.\r\n\r\nDon't say I done it for I did it.\r\n\r\nDon't say he is older than me; say older than I.\r\n\r\nDon't say she does not see any; say she does not see at all.\r\n\r\nDon't say not as I know; say not that I know.\r\n\r\nDon't say he calculates to get off; say he expects to get off.\r\n\r\nDon't say he don't; say he doesn't.\r\n\r\nDon't say she is some better; say she is somewhat better.\r\n\r\nDon't say where are you stopping?

Your conduct on the street should always be modest and dignified.\r\nLadies should carefully avoid all loud and boisterous conversation or\r\nlaughter and all undue liveliness in public.\r\n\r\n2. When walking on the street do not permit yourself to be\r\nabsent-minded, as to fail to recognize a friend; do not go along\r\nreading a book or newspaper.\r\n\r\n3. In walking with a lady on the street give her the inner side of\r\nthe walk, unless the outside if the safer part; in which case she is\r\nentitled to it.\r\n\r\n4. Your arm should not be given to any lady except your wife or a near\r\nrelative, or a very old lady, during the day, unless her comfort or\r\nsafety requires it. At night the arm should always be offered; also in\r\nascending the steps of a public building.\r\n\r\n5. In crossing the street a lady should gracefully raise her dress\r\na little above her ankle with one hand. To raise the dress with both\r\nhands is vulgar, except in places where the mud is very deep.\r\n\r\n6. A gentleman meeting a lady acquaintance on the street should not\r\npresume to join her in her walk without first asking her permission.\r\n\r\n7. If you have anything to say to a lady whom you may happen to meet\r\nin the street, however intimate you may be, do not stop her, but turn\r\nround and walk in company with her; you can take leave at the end of\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\n8. A lady should not venture out upon the street alone after dark. By\r\nso doing she compromises her dignity, and exposes herself to indignity\r\nat the hands of the rougher class.\r\n\r\n9. Never offer to shake hands with a lady in the street if you have on\r\ndark or soiled gloves, as you may soil hers.\r\n\r\n10. A lady does not form acquaintances upon the street, or seek to\r\nattract the attention of the other sex or of persons of her own sex.\r\nHer conduct is always modest and unassuming. Neither does a lady\r\ndemand services or favors from a gentleman. She accepts them\r\ngraciously, always expressing her thanks. A gentleman will not stand\r\non the street corners, or in hotel doorways, or store windows and\r\ngaze impertinently at ladies as they pass by. This is the exclusive\r\nbusiness of loafers.\r\n\r\n11. In walking with a lady who has your arm, should you have to cross\r\nthe street, do not disengage your arm and go around upon the outside,\r\nunless the lady's comfort renders it necessary. In walking with a\r\nlady, where it is necessary for you to proceed singly, always go\r\nbefore her.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nETIQUETTE BETWEEN SEXES.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A lady should be a lady, and a gentleman a gentleman under any and\r\nall circumstances.\r\n\r\n2. FEMALE INDIFFERENCE TO MAN.--There is nothing that affects\r\nthe nature and pleasure of man so much as a proper and friendly\r\nrecognition from a lady, and as women are more or less dependent upon\r\nman's good-will, either for gain or pleasure, it surely stands to\r\ntheir interest to be reasonably pleasant and courteous in his presence\r\nor society. Indifference is always a poor investment, whether in\r\nsociety or business.\r\n\r\n3. GALLANTRY AND LADYISM should be a prominent feature in the\r\neducation of young people. Politeness to ladies cultivates the\r\nintellect and refines the soul and he who can be easy and\r\nentertaining in the society of ladies has mastered one of the greatest\r\naccomplishments. There is nothing taught in school, academy or\r\ncollege, that contributes so much to the happiness of man as a full\r\ndevelopment of his social and moral qualities.\r\n\r\n4. LADYLIKE ETIQUETTE.--No woman can afford to treat men rudely. A\r\nlady must have a high intellectual and moral ideal and hold herself\r\nabove reproach. She must remember that the art of pleasing and\r\nentertaining gentlemen is infinitely more ornamental than laces,\r\nribbons or diamonds. Dress and glitter may please man, but it will\r\nnever benefit him.\r\n\r\n5. CULTIVATE DEFICIENCIES.--Men and women poorly sexed treat each\r\nother with more or less indifference, whereas a hearty sexuality\r\ninspires both to a right estimation of the faculties and qualities of\r\neach other. Those who are deficient should seek society and overcome\r\ntheir deficiencies. While some naturally inherit faculties as\r\nentertainers others are compelled to acquire them by cultivation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ASKING AN HONEST QUESTION.]\r\n\r\n6. LADIES' SOCIETY.--He who seeks ladies' society should seek an\r\neducation and should have a pure heart and a pure mind. Read good,\r\npure and wholesome literature and study human nature, and you will\r\nalways be a favorite in the society circle.\r\n\r\n7. WOMAN HATERS.--Some men with little refinement and strong sensual\r\nfeelings virtually insult and thereby disgust and repel every female\r\nthey meet. They look upon woman with an inherent vulgarity, and doubt\r\nthe virtue and integrity of all alike. But it is because they are\r\ngenerally insincere and impure themselves, and with such a nature\r\nculture and refinement are out of the question, there must be a\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\n8. MEN HATERS.--Women who look upon all men as odious, corrupt or\r\nhateful, are no doubt so themselves, though they may be clad in\r\nsilk and sparkle with diamonds and be as pretty as a lily; but their\r\nhypocrisy will out, and they can never win the heart of a faithful,\r\nconscientious and well balanced man. A good woman has broad ideas and\r\ngreat sympathy. She respects all men until they are proven unworthy.\r\n\r\n9. FOND OF CHILDREN.--The man who is naturally fond of children will\r\nmake a good husband and a good father. So it behooves the young man,\r\nto notice children and cultivate the art of pleasing them. It will be\r\na source of interest, education and permanent benefit to all.\r\n\r\n10. EXCESSIVE LUXURY.--Although the association with ladies is an\r\nexpensive luxury, yet it is not an expensive education. It elevates,\r\nrefines, sanctifies and purifies, and improves the whole man. A young\r\nman who has a pure and genuine respect for ladies, will not only make\r\na good husband, but a good citizen as well.\r\n\r\n11. MASCULINE ATTENTION.--No woman is entitled to any more attention\r\nthan her loveliness and ladylike conduct will command. Those who are\r\nmost pleasing will receive the most attention, and those who desire\r\nmore should aspire to acquire more by cultivating those graces and\r\nvirtues which ennoble woman, but no lady should lower or distort her\r\nown true ideal, or smother and crucify her conscience, in order\r\nto please any living man. A good man will admire a good woman, and\r\ndeceptions cannot long be concealed. Her show of dry goods or glitter\r\nof jewels cannot long cover up her imperfections or deceptions.\r\n\r\n12. PURITY.--Purity of purpose will solve all social problems. Let all\r\nstand on this exalted sexual platform, and teach every man just how\r\nto treat the female sex, and every woman how to behave towards the\r\nmasculine; and it will incomparably adorn the manners of both, make\r\nboth happy in each other, and mutually develop each other's sexuality\r\nand humanity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL RULES ON TABLE MANNERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Help ladies with a due appreciation; do not overload the plate of\r\nany person you serve. Never pour gravy on a plate without permission.\r\nIt spoils the meat for some persons.\r\n\r\n2. Never put anything by force upon any one's plate. It is extremely\r\nill-bred, though extremely common, to press one to eat of anything.\r\n\r\n3. If at dinner you are requested to help any one to sauce or gravy,\r\ndo not pour it over the meat or vegetables, but on one side of them.\r\nNever load down a person's plate with anything.\r\n\r\n4. As soon as you are helped, begin to eat, or at least begin to\r\noccupy yourself with what you have before you. Do not wait till your\r\nneighbors are served--a custom that was long ago abandoned.\r\n\r\n5. Should you, however, find yourself at a table where they have the\r\nold-fashioned steel forks, eat with your knife, as the others do, and\r\ndo not let it be seen that you have any objection to doing so.\r\n\r\n6. Bread should be broken. To butter a large piece of bread and then\r\nbite it, as children do, is something the knowing never do.\r\n\r\n7. In eating game or poultry do not touch the bones with your fingers.\r\nTo take a bone in the fingers for the purpose of picking it, is looked\r\nupon as being very inelegant.\r\n\r\n8. Never use your own knife or fork to help another. Use rather the\r\nknife or fork of the person you help.\r\n\r\n9. Never send your knife or fork, or either of them, on your plate\r\nwhen you send for second supply.\r\n\r\n10. Never turn your elbows out when you use your knife and fork. Keep\r\nthem close to your sides.\r\n\r\n11. Whenever you use your fingers to convey anything to your mouth or\r\nto remove anything from the mouth, let it be the fingers of the left\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n12. Tea, coffee, chocolate and the like are drank from the cup and\r\nnever from the saucer.\r\n\r\n13. In masticating your food, keep your mouth shut; otherwise you will\r\nmake a noise that will be very offensive to those around you.\r\n\r\n14. Don't attempt to talk with a full mouth. One thing at a time is as\r\nmuch as any man can do well.\r\n\r\n15. Should you find a worm or insect in your food, say nothing about\r\nit.\r\n\r\n16. If a dish is distasteful to you, decline it, and without comment.\r\n\r\n17. Never put bones or bits of fruit on the table cloth. Put them on\r\nthe side of your plate.\r\n\r\n18. Do not hesitate to take the last piece on the dish, simply because\r\nit is the last. To do so is to directly express the fear that you\r\nwould exhaust the supply.\r\n\r\n19. If you would be what you would like to be--abroad, take care that\r\nyou _are_ what you would like to be--at home.\r\n\r\n20. Avoid picking your teeth at the table if possible; but if you\r\nmust, do it, it you can, where you are not observed.\r\n\r\n21. If an accident of any kind soever should occur during dinner, the\r\ncause being who or what it may, you should not seem to note it.\r\n\r\n22. Should you be so unfortunate as to overturn or to break anything,\r\nyou should make no apology. You might let your regret appear in your\r\nface, but it would not be proper to put it in words.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PARLOR RECITATION.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSOCIAL DUTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Man In Society is like a flower,\r\n  Blown in its native bed. 'Tis there alone\r\n  His faculties expanded in full bloom\r\n  Shine out, there only reach their proper use.\r\n  --COWPER.\r\n\r\n  The primal duties shine aloft like stars;\r\n  The charities that soothe, and heal, and bless,\r\n  Are scatter'd at the feet of man like flowers.\r\n  --WORDSWORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. MEMBERSHIP IN SOCIETY.--Many fail to get hold of the idea that they\r\nare members of society. They seem to suppose that the social machinery\r\nof the world is self-operating. They cast their first ballot with an\r\nemotion of pride perhaps, but are sure to pay their first tax with\r\na groan. They see political organizations in active existence; the\r\nparish, and the church, and other important bodies that embrace in\r\nsome form of society all men, are successfully operated; and yet these\r\nyoung men have no part or lot in the matter. They do not think of\r\ngiving a day's time to society.\r\n\r\n2. BEGIN EARLY.--One of the first things a young man should do is to\r\nsee that he is acting his part in society. The earlier this is begun\r\nthe better. I think that the opponents of secret societies in colleges\r\nhave failed to estimate the benefit which it must be to every\r\nmember to be obliged to contribute to the support of his particular\r\norganization, and to assume personal care and responsibility as a\r\nmember. If these societies have a tendency to teach the lessons of\r\nwhich I speak, they are a blessed thing.\r\n\r\n3. DO YOUR PART.--Do your part, and be a man among men. Assume your\r\nportion of social responsibility, and see that you discharge it well.\r\nIf you do not do this, then you are mean, and society has the right\r\nto despise you just as much as it chooses to do so. You are, to use a\r\nword more emphatic than agreeable, a sneak, and have not a claim upon\r\nyour neighbors for a single polite word.\r\n\r\n4. A WHINING COMPLAINER.--Society, as it is called, is far more apt\r\nto pay its dues to the individual than the individual to society. Have\r\nyou, young man, who are at home whining over the fact that you\r\ncannot get into society, done anything to give you a claim to social\r\nrecognition? Are you able to make any return for social recognition\r\nand social privileges? Do you know anything? What kind of coin do you\r\npropose to pay in the discharge of the obligation which comes upon you\r\nwith social recognition? In other words, as a return for what you wish\r\nto have society do for you, what can you do for society? This is a\r\nvery important question--more important to you than to society. The\r\nquestion is, whether you will be a member of society by right, or\r\nby courtesy. If you have so mean a spirit as to be content to be a\r\nbeneficiary of society--to receive favors and to confer none--you have\r\nno business in the society to which you aspire. You are an exacting,\r\nconceited fellow.\r\n\r\n5. WHAT ARE YOU GOOD FOR?--Are you a good beau, and are you willing to\r\nmake yourself useful in waiting on the ladies on all occasions? Have\r\nyou a good set of teeth, which you are willing to show whenever\r\nthe wit of the company gets off a good thing? Are you a true,\r\nstraightforward, manly fellow, with whose healthful and uncorrupted\r\nnature it is good for society to come in contact? In short, do you\r\npossess anything of any social value? If you do, and are willing\r\nto impart it, society will yield itself to your touch. If you\r\nhave nothing, then society, as such, owes you nothing. Christian\r\nphilanthropy may put its arm around you, as a lonely young man, about\r\nto spoil for want of something, but it is very sad and humiliating\r\nfor a young man to be brought to that. There are people who devote\r\nthemselves to nursing young men, and doing them good. If they invite\r\nyou to tea, go by all means, and try your hand. If in the course of\r\nthe evening, you can prove to them that your society is desirable, you\r\nhave won a point. Don't be patronized.\r\n\r\n6. THE MORBID CONDITION.--Young men, you are apt to get into a morbid\r\nstate of mind, which declines them to social intercourse. They\r\nbecome devoted to business with such exclusiveness, that all social\r\nintercourse is irksome. They go out to tea as if they were going\r\nto jail, and drag themselves to a party as to an execution. This\r\ndisposition is thoroughly morbid, and to be overcome by going where\r\nyou are invited, always, and with a sacrifice of feeling.\r\n\r\n7. THE COMMON BLUNDER.--Don't shrink from contact with anything but\r\nbad morals. Men who affect your unhealthy minds with antipathy, will\r\nprove themselves very frequently to be your best friends and most\r\ndelightful companions. Because a man seems uncongenial to you, who\r\nare squeamish and foolish, you have no right to shun him. We become\r\ncharitable by knowing men. We learn to love those whom we have\r\ndespised by rubbing against them. Do you not remember some instance of\r\nmeeting a man or woman whom you had never previously known or cared\r\nto know--an individual, perhaps, against whom you have entertained\r\nthe strongest prejudices--but to whom you became bound by a lifelong\r\nfriendship through the influence of a three days' intercourse? Yet,\r\nif you had not thus met, you would have carried through life the idea\r\nthat it would be impossible for you to give your fellowship to such an\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\n8. THE FOOLISHNESS OF MAN.--God has introduced into human character\r\ninfinite variety, and for you to say that you do not love and will not\r\nassociate with a man because he is unlike you, is not only foolish but\r\nwrong. You are to remember that in the precise manner and decree in\r\nwhich a man differs from you, do you differ from him; and that from\r\nhis standpoint you are naturally as repulsive to him, as he, from\r\nyour standpoint, is to you. So, leave all this talk of congeniality to\r\nsilly girls and transcendental dreamers.\r\n\r\n9. DO BUSINESS IN YOUR WAY AND BE HONEST.--Do your business in your\r\nown way, and concede to every man the privilege which you claim for\r\nyourself. The more you mix with men, the less you will be disposed to\r\nquarrel, and the more charitable and liberal will you become. The fact\r\nthat you do not understand a man, is quite as likely to be your fault\r\nas his. There are a good many chances in favor of the conclusion that,\r\nif you fail to like an individual whose acquaintance you make it is\r\nthrough your own ignorance and illiberality. So I say, meet every man\r\nhonestly; seek to know him; and you will find that in those points\r\nin which he differs from you rests his power to instruct you, enlarge\r\nyou, and do you good. Keep your heart open for everybody, and be sure\r\nthat you shall have your reward. You shall find a jewel under the most\r\nuncouth exterior; and associated with homeliest manners and oddest\r\nways and ugliest faces, you will find rare virtues, fragrant little\r\nhumanities, and inspiring heroisms.\r\n\r\n10. WITHOUT SOCIETY, WITHOUT INFLUENCE.--Again: you can have no\r\ninfluence unless you are social. An unsocial man is as devoid of\r\ninfluence as an ice-peak is of verdure. It is through social contact\r\nand absolute social value alone that you can accomplish any great\r\nsocial good. It is through the invisible lines which you are able to\r\nattach to the minds with which you are brought into association alone\r\nthat you can tow society, with its deeply freighted interests, to the\r\ngreat haven of your hope.\r\n\r\n11. THE REVENGE OF SOCIETY.--The revenge which society takes upon\r\nthe man who isolates himself, is as terrible as it is inevitable. The\r\npride which sits alone will have the privilege of sitting alone in its\r\nsublime disgust till it drops into the grave. The world sweeps by the\r\nman, carelessly, remorselessly, contemptuously. He has no hold upon\r\nsociety, because he is no part of it.\r\n\r\n12. THE CONCLUSION OF THE WHOLE MATTER.--You cannot move men until you\r\nare one of them. They will not follow you until they have heard your\r\nvoice, shaken your hand, and fully learned your principles and your\r\nsympathies. It makes no difference how much you know, or how much you\r\nare capable of doing. You may pile accomplishment upon acquisition\r\nmountain high; but if you fail to be a social man, demonstrating to\r\nsociety that your lot is with the rest, a little child with a song in\r\nits mouth, and a kiss for all and a pair of innocent hands to lay upon\r\nthe knees, shall lead more hearts and change the direction of more\r\nlives than you.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GATHERING ORANGES IN THE SUNNY SOUTH.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPOLITENESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. BEAUTIFUL BEHAVIOR.--Politeness has been described as the art of\r\nshowing, by external signs, the internal regard we have for others.\r\nBut one may be perfectly polite to another without necessarily paying\r\na special regard for him. Good manners are neither more nor less than\r\nbeautiful behavior. It has been well said that \"a beautiful form is\r\nbetter than a beautiful face, and a beautiful behavior is better\r\nthan a beautiful form; it gives a higher pleasure than statues or\r\npictures--it is the finest of the fine arts.\"\r\n\r\n2. TRUE POLITENESS.--The truest politeness comes of sincerity. It must\r\nbe the outcome of the heart, or it will make no lasting impression;\r\nfor no amount of polish can dispense with truthfulness. The natural\r\ncharacter must be allowed to appear, freed of its angularities and\r\nasperities. Though politeness, in its best form, should resemble\r\nwater--\"best when clearest, most simple, and without taste\"--yet\r\ngenius in a man will always cover many defects of manner, and much\r\nwill be excused to the strong and the original. Without genuineness\r\nand individuality, human life would lose much of its interest and\r\nvariety, as well as its manliness and robustness of character.\r\n\r\n3. PERSONALITY OF OTHERS.--True politeness especially exhibits itself\r\nin regard for the personality of others. A man will respect the\r\nindividuality of another if he wishes to be respected himself. He will\r\nhave due regard for his views and opinions, even though they differ\r\nfrom his own. The well-mannered man pays a compliment to another, and\r\nsometimes even secures his respect by patiently listening to him. He\r\nis simply tolerant and forbearant, and refrains from judging harshly;\r\nand harsh judgments of others will almost invariably provoke harsh\r\njudgments of ourselves.\r\n\r\n4. THE IMPOLITE.--The impolite, impulsive man will, however, sometimes\r\nrather lose his friend than his joke. He may surely be pronounced\r\na very foolish person who secures another's hatred at the price\r\nof a moment's gratification. It was a saying of Burnel, the\r\nengineer--himself one of the kindest-natured of men--that \"spite and\r\nill-nature are among the most expensive luxuries in life.\" Dr. Johnson\r\nonce said: \"Sir, a man has no more right to say a rude thing to\r\nanother than to knock him down.\"\r\n\r\n5. FEELINGS OF OTHERS.--Want of respect for the feelings of others\r\nusually originates in selfishness, and issues in hardness and\r\nrepulsiveness of manner. It may not proceed from malignity so much, as\r\nfrom want of sympathy, and want of delicacy--a want of that perception\r\nof, and attention to, those little and apparently trifling things, by\r\nwhich pleasure is given or pain occasioned to others. Indeed, it may\r\nbe said that in self-sacrifice in the ordinary intercourse of life,\r\nmainly consists the difference between being well and ill bred.\r\nWithout some degree of self-restraint in society a man may be found\r\nalmost insufferable. No one has pleasure in holding intercourse with\r\nsuch a person, and he is a constant source of annoyance to those about\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n6. DISREGARD OF OTHERS.--Men may show their disregard to others in\r\nvarious impolite ways, as, for instance, by neglect of propriety in\r\ndress, by the absence of cleanliness, or by indulging in repulsive\r\nhabits. The slovenly, dirty person, by rendering himself physically\r\ndisagreeable, sets the tastes and feelings of others at defiance, and\r\nis rude and uncivil, only under another form.\r\n\r\n7. THE BEST SCHOOL OF POLITENESS.--The first and best school of\r\npoliteness, as of character, is always the home, where woman is the\r\nteacher. The manners of society at large are but the reflex of the\r\nmanners of our collective homes, neither better nor worse. Yet, with\r\nall the disadvantages of ungenial homes, men may practice self-culture\r\nof manner as of intellect, and learn by good examples to cultivate a\r\ngraceful and agreeable behavior towards others. Most men are like so\r\nmany gems in the rough, which need polishing by contact with other and\r\nbetter natures, to bring out their full beauty and lustre. Some have\r\nbut one side polished, sufficient only to show the delicate graining\r\nof the interior; but to bring out the full qualities of the gem, needs\r\nthe discipline of experience, and contact with the best examples of\r\ncharacter in the intercourse of daily life.\r\n\r\n8. CAPTIOUSNESS OF MANNER.--While captiousness of manner, and the\r\nhabit of disputing and contradicting every thing said, is chilling and\r\nrepulsive, the opposite habit of assenting to, and sympathizing\r\nwith, every statement made, or emotion expressed, is almost equally\r\ndisagreeable. It is unmanly, and is felt to be dishonest. \"It may seem\r\ndifficult,\" says Richard Sharp, \"to steer always between bluntness and\r\nplain dealing, between merited praises and lavishing indiscriminate\r\nflattery; but it is very easy--good humor, kindheartedness, and\r\nperfect simplicity, being all that are requisite to do what is right\r\nin the right way. At the same time many are impolite, not because\r\nthey mean to be so, but because they are awkward, and perhaps know no\r\nbetter.\"\r\n\r\n9. SHY PEOPLE.--Again many persons are thought to be stiff, reserved,\r\nand proud, when they are only shy. Shyness is characteristic of\r\nmost people of the Teutonic race. From all that can be learned of\r\nShakespeare, it is to be inferred that he was an exceedingly shy man.\r\nThe manner in which his plays were sent into the world--for it is not\r\nknown that he edited or authorized the publication of a single one\r\nof them,--and the dates at which they respectively appeared, are mere\r\nmatters of conjecture.\r\n\r\n10. SELF-FORGETFULNESS.--True politeness is best evinced by\r\nself-forgetfulness, or self-denial in the interest of others. Mr.\r\nGarfield, our martyred president, was a gentleman of royal type. His\r\nfriend, Col. Rockwell, says of him: \"In, the midst of his suffering he\r\nnever forgets others. For instance, to-day he said to me, 'Rockwell,\r\nthere is a poor soldier's widow who came to me before this thing\r\noccurred, and I promised her, she should be provided for. I want you\r\nto see that the matter is attended to at once.' He is the most docile\r\npatient I ever saw.\"\r\n\r\n11. ITS BRIGHT SIDE.--We have thus far spoken of shyness as a defect.\r\nBut there is another way of looking at it; for even shyness has its\r\nbright side, and contains an element of good. Shy men and shy races\r\nare ungraceful and undemonstrative, because, as regards society at\r\nlarge, they are comparatively unsociable. They do not possess those\r\nelegancies of manner acquired by free intercourse, which distinguish\r\nthe social races, because their tendency is to shun society rather\r\nthan to seek it. They are shy in the presence of strangers, and shy\r\neven in their own families. They hide their affections under a robe\r\nof reserve, and when they do give way to their feelings, it is only in\r\nsome very hidden inner chamber. And yet, the feelings are there, and\r\nnot the less healthy and genuine, though they are not made the subject\r\nof exhibition to others.\r\n\r\n12. WORTHY OF CULTIVATION.--While, therefore, grace of manner,\r\npoliteness of behavior, elegance of demeanor, and all the arts\r\nthat contribute to make life pleasant and beautiful, are worthy of\r\ncultivation, it must not be at the expense of the more solid and\r\nenduring qualities of honesty, sincerity, and truthfulness. The\r\nfountain of beauty must be in the heart more than in the eye, and if\r\nit does not tend to produce beautiful life and noble practice, it will\r\nprove of comparatively little avail. Politeness of manner is not worth\r\nmuch, unless it is accompanied by polite actions.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF GOOD CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Unless above himself he can\r\n  Erect himself, how poor a thing is man!\r\n  --DANIEL.\r\n\r\n  \"Character is moral order seen through the medium of an individual\r\n  nature--Men of character are the conscience of the society to\r\n  which they belong.\"\r\n  --EMERSON.\r\n\r\n  The purest treasure mortal times afford,\r\n  Is--spotless reputation; that away,\r\n  Men are but gilded loam, or painted clay,\r\n  A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest\r\n  Is--a bold Spirit in a loyal breast.\r\n  --SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. REPUTATION.--The two most precious things this side the grave are\r\nour reputation and our life. But it is to be lamented that the most\r\ncontemptible whisper may deprive us of the one, and the weakest weapon\r\nof the other. A wise man, therefore, will be more anxious to deserve\r\na fair name than to possess it, and this will teach him so to live, as\r\nnot to be afraid to die.\r\n\r\n2. CHARACTER.--Character is one of the greatest motive powers in the\r\nworld. In its noblest embodiments, it exemplifies human nature in its\r\nhighest forms, for it exhibits man at his best.\r\n\r\n3. THE HEART THAT RULES IN LIFE.--Although genius always commands\r\nadmiration, character most secures respect. The former is more the\r\nproduct of brain power, the latter of heart power; and in the long run\r\nit is the heart that rules in life. Men of genius stand to society in\r\nthe relation of its intellect as men of character of its conscience:\r\nand while the former are admired, the latter are followed.\r\n\r\n4. THE HIGHEST IDEAL OF LIFE AND CHARACTER.--Common-place though it\r\nmay appear, this doing of one's duty embodies the highest ideal of\r\nlife and character. There may be nothing heroic about it; but the\r\ncommon lot of men is not heroic. And though the abiding sense of duty\r\nupholds man in his highest attitudes, it also equally sustains him in\r\nthe transaction of the ordinary affairs of every-day existence.\r\nMan's life is \"centered in the sphere of common duties.\" The most\r\ninfluential of all the virtues are those which are the most in request\r\nfor daily use. They wear the best, and last the longest.\r\n\r\n5. WEALTH.--Wealth in the hands of men of weak purpose, or deficient\r\nself-control, or of ill regulated passions is only a temptation and a\r\nsnare--the source, it may be, of infinite mischief to themselves, and\r\noften to others.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, a condition of comparative poverty is compatible with\r\ncharacter in its highest form. A man may possess only his industry,\r\nhis frugality, his integrity, and yet stand high in the rank of true\r\nmanhood. The advice which Burns' father gave him was the best:\r\n\r\n  \"He bade me act a manly part, though I had ne'er a farthing,\r\n  For without an honest, manly heart no man was worth regarding.\"\r\n\r\n6. CHARACTER IS PROPERTY.--It is the noblest of possessions. It is an\r\nestate in the general good-will and respect of men; they who invest in\r\nit--though they may not become rich in this world's goods--will find\r\ntheir reward in esteem and reputation fairly and honorably won. And\r\nit is right that in life good qualities should tell--that industry,\r\nvirtue, and goodness should rank the highest--and that the really best\r\nmen should be foremost.\r\n\r\n7. SIMPLE HONESTY OF PURPOSE.--This in a man goes a long way in life,\r\nif founded on a just estimate of himself and a steady obedience to the\r\nrule he knows and feels to be right. It holds a man straight, gives\r\nhim strength and sustenance, and forms a mainspring of vigorous\r\naction. No man is bound to be rich or great--no, nor to be wise--but\r\nevery man is bound to be honest and virtuous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOME AMUSEMENTS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFAMILY GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. GENTLENESS MUST CHARACTERIZE EVERY ACT OF AUTHORITY.--The storm of\r\nexcitement that may make the child start, bears no relation to actual\r\nobedience. The inner firmness, that sees and feels a moral conviction\r\nand expects obedience, is only disguised and defeated by bluster. The\r\nmore calm and direct it is, the greater certainty it has of dominion.\r\n\r\n2. FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF SMALL CHILDREN.--For the government of small\r\nchildren speak only in the authority of love, yet authority, loving\r\nand to be obeyed. The most important lesson to impart is obedience to\r\nauthority as authority. The question of salvation with most children\r\nwill be settled as soon as they learn to obey parental authority. It\r\nestablishes a habit and order of mind that is ready to accept divine\r\nauthority. This precludes skepticism and disobedience, and induces\r\nthat childlike trust and spirit set forth as a necessary state of\r\nsalvation. Children that are never made to obey are left to drift\r\ninto the sea of passion where the pressure for surrender only tends to\r\ndrive them at greater speed from the haven of safety.\r\n\r\n3. HABITS OF SELF-DENIAL.--Form in the child habits of self-denial.\r\nPampering never matures good character.\r\n\r\n4. EMPHASIZE INTEGRITY.--Keep the moral tissues tough in integrity;\r\nthen it will hold a hook of obligations when once set in a sure place.\r\nThere is nothing more vital. Shape all your experiments to preserve\r\nthe integrity. Do not so reward it that it becomes mercenary. Turning\r\nState's evidence is a dangerous experiment in morals. Prevent deceit\r\nfrom succeeding.\r\n\r\n5. GUARD MODESTY.--To be brazen is to imperil some of the best\r\nelements of character. Modesty may be strengthened into a becoming\r\nconfidence, but brazen facedness can seldom be toned down into\r\ndecency. It requires the miracle of grace.\r\n\r\n6. PROTECT PURITY.--Teach your children to loathe impurity. Study\r\nthe character of their playmates. Watch their books. Keep them from\r\ncorruption at all cost. The groups of youth in the school and in\r\nsociety, and in business places, seed with improprieties of word and\r\nthought. Never relax your vigilance along this exposed border.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOTH PUZZLED.]\r\n\r\n7. THREATEN THE LEAST POSSIBLE.--In family government threaten the\r\nleast possible. Some parents rattle off their commands with penalties\r\nso profusely that there is a steady roar of hostilities about the\r\nchild's head. These threats are forgotten by the parent and unheeded\r\nby the child. All government is at an end.\r\n\r\n8. DO NOT ENFORCE TOO MANY COMMANDS.--Leave a few things within the\r\nrange of the child's knowledge that are not forbidden. Keep your word\r\ngood, but do not have too much of it out to be redeemed.\r\n\r\n9. PUNISH AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE.--Sometimes punishment is necessary,\r\nbut the less it is resorted to the better.\r\n\r\n10. NEVER PUNISH IN A PASSION.--Wrath only becomes cruelty. There is\r\nno moral power in it. When you seem to be angry you can do no good.\r\n\r\n11. BRUTISH VIOLENCE ONLY MULTIPLIES OFFENDERS.--Striking and beating\r\nthe body seldom reaches the soul. Fear and hatred beget rebellion.\r\n\r\n12. PUNISH PRIVATELY.--Avoid punishments that break down self-respect.\r\nStriking the body produces shame and indignation. It is enough for the\r\nother children to know that discipline is being administered.\r\n\r\n13. NEVER STOP SHORT OF SUCCESS.--When the child is not conquered the\r\npunishment has been worse than wasted. Reach the point where neither\r\nwrath nor sullenness remain. By firm persistency and persuasion\r\nrequire an open look of recognition and peace. It is only evil to stir\r\nup the devil unless he is cast out. Ordinarily one complete victory\r\nwill last a child for a lifetime. But if the child relapses, repeat\r\nthe dose with proper accompaniments.\r\n\r\n14. DO NOT REQUIRE CHILDREN TO COMPLAIN OF THEMSELVES FOR PARDON.--It\r\nbegets either sycophants or liars. It is the part of the government to\r\ndetect offences. It reverses the order of matters to shirk this duty.\r\n\r\n15. GRADE AUTHORITY UP TO LIBERTY.--The growing child must have\r\nexperiments of freedom. Lead him gently into the family. Counsel\r\nwith him. Let him plan as he can. By and by he has the confidence of\r\ncourage without the danger of exposures.\r\n\r\n16. RESPECT.--Parents must respect each other. Undermining either\r\nundermines both. Always govern in the spirit of love.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCONVERSATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome men are very entertaining for a first interview, but after that\r\nthey are exhausted, and run out; on a second meeting we shall find\r\nthem very flat and monotonous; like hand-organs, we have heard all\r\ntheir tunes.--COULTON.\r\n\r\nHe who sedulously attends, pointedly asks, calmly speaks, coolly\r\nanswers, and ceases when he has no more to say, is in possession of\r\nsome of the best requisites of man.--LAVATER.\r\n\r\nBeauty is never so lovely as when adorned with the smile, and\r\nconversation never sits easier upon us than when we know and\r\nthen discharge ourselves in a symphony of Laughter, which may not\r\nimproperly be called the Chorus of Conversation.--STEELE.\r\n\r\nThe first ingredient in Conversation is Truth, the next Good Sense,\r\nthe third Good Humor, and the fourth Wit.--SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOME LESSONS IN CONVERSATION.\r\n\r\nSay nothing unpleasant when it can be avoided.\r\n\r\nAvoid satire and sarcasm.\r\n\r\nNever repeat a word that was not intended for repetition.\r\n\r\nCultivate the supreme wisdom, which consists less in saying what ought\r\nto be said than in not saying what ought not to be said.\r\n\r\nOften cultivate \"flashes of silence.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the larger half of the conversation to listen well.\r\n\r\nListen to others patiently, especially the poor.\r\n\r\nSharp sayings are an evidence of low breeding.\r\n\r\nShun faultfindings and faultfinders.\r\n\r\nNever utter an uncomplimentary word against anyone.\r\n\r\nCompliments delicately hinted and sincerely intended are a grace in\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nCommendation of gifts and cleverness properly put are in good taste,\r\nbut praise of beauty is offensive.\r\n\r\nRepeating kind expressions is proper.\r\n\r\nCompliments given in a joke may be gratefully received in earnest.\r\n\r\nThe manner and tone are important parts of a compliment.\r\n\r\nAvoid egotism.\r\n\r\nDon't talk of yourself, or of your friends or your deeds.\r\n\r\nGive no sign that you appreciate your own merits.\r\n\r\nDo not become a distributer of the small talk of a community. The\r\nsmiles of your auditors do not mean respect.\r\n\r\nAvoid giving the impression of one filled with \"suppressed egotism.\"\r\n\r\nNever mention your own peculiarities; for culture destroys vanity.\r\n\r\nAvoid exaggeration.\r\n\r\nDo not be too positive.\r\n\r\nDo not talk of display oratory.\r\n\r\nDo not try to lead in conversation looking around to enforce silence.\r\n\r\nLay aside affected, silly etiquette for the natural dictates of the\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nDirect the conversation where others can join with you and impart to\r\nyou useful information.\r\n\r\nAvoid oddity. Eccentricity is shallow vanity.\r\n\r\nBe modest.\r\n\r\nBe what you wish to seem.\r\n\r\nAvoid repeating a brilliant or clever saying.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THINKING ONLY OF DRESS.]\r\n\r\nIf you find bashfulness or embarrassment coming upon you, do or say\r\nsomething at once. The commonest matter gently stated is better than\r\nan embarrassing silence. Sometimes changing your position, or looking\r\ninto a book for a moment may relieve your embarrassment, and dispel\r\nany settling stiffness.\r\n\r\nAvoid telling many stories, or repeating a story more than once in the\r\nsame company.\r\n\r\nNever treat any one as if you simply wanted him to tell stories.\r\nPeople laugh and despise such a one.\r\n\r\nNever tell a coarse story. No wit or preface can make it excusable.\r\n\r\nTell a story, if at all, only as an illustration, and not for itself.\r\nTell it accurately.\r\n\r\nBe careful in asking questions for the purpose of starting\r\nconversation or drawing out a person, not to be rude or intrusive.\r\n\r\nNever take liberties by staring, or by any rudeness.\r\n\r\nNever infringe upon any established regulations among strangers.\r\n\r\nDo not always prove yourself to be the one in the right. The right\r\nwill appear. You need only give it a chance.\r\n\r\nAvoid argument in conversation. It is discourteous to your host.\r\n\r\nCultivate paradoxes in conversation with your peers. They add interest\r\nto common-place matters. To strike the harmless faith of ordinary\r\npeople in any public idol is waste, but such a movement with those\r\nable to reply is better.\r\n\r\nNever discourse upon your ailments.\r\n\r\nNever use words of the meaning or pronunciation of which you are\r\nuncertain.\r\n\r\nAvoid discussing your own or other people's domestic concerns.\r\n\r\nNever prompt a slow speaker, as if you had all the ability. In\r\nconversing with a foreigner who may be learning our language, it is\r\nexcusable to help him in some delicate way.\r\n\r\nNever give advice unasked.\r\n\r\nDo not manifest impatience.\r\n\r\nDo not interrupt another when speaking.\r\n\r\nDo not find fault, though you may gently criticise.\r\n\r\nDo not appear to notice inaccuracies of speech in others.\r\n\r\nDo not always commence a conversation by allusion to the weather.\r\n\r\nDo not, when narrating an incident, continually say, \"you see,\" \"you\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\nDo not allow yourself to lose temper or speak excitedly.\r\n\r\nDo not introduce professional or other topics that the company\r\ngenerally cannot take an interest in.\r\n\r\nDo not talk very loud. A firm, clear, distinct, yet mild, gentle, and\r\nmusical voice has great power.\r\n\r\nDo not be absent-minded, requiring the speaker to repeat what has been\r\nsaid that you may understand.\r\n\r\nDo not try to force yourself into the confidence of others.\r\n\r\nDo not use profanity, vulgar terms, words of double meaning, or\r\nlanguage that will bring the blush to anyone.\r\n\r\nDo not allow yourself to speak ill of the absent one if it can be\r\navoided. The day may come when some friend will be needed to defend\r\nyou in your absence.\r\n\r\nDo not speak with contempt and ridicule of a locality which you may be\r\nvisiting. Find something to truthfully praise and commend; thus make\r\nyourself agreeable.\r\n\r\nDo not make a pretense of gentility, nor parade the fact that you are\r\na descendant of any notable family. You must pass for just what you\r\nare, and must stand on your own merit.\r\n\r\nDo not contradict. In making a correction say, \"I beg your pardon,\r\nbut I had the impression that it was so and so.\" Be careful in\r\ncontradicting, as you may be wrong yourself.\r\n\r\nDo not be unduly familiar; you will merit contempt if you are. Neither\r\nshould you be dogmatic in your assertions, arrogating to yourself such\r\nconsequences in your opinions.\r\n\r\nDo not be too lavish in your praise of various members of your own\r\nfamily when speaking to strangers; the person to whom you are speaking\r\nmay know some faults that you do not.\r\n\r\nDo not feel it incumbent upon yourself to carry your point in\r\nconversation. Should the person with whom you are conversing feel the\r\nsame, your talk may lead into violent argument.\r\n\r\nDo not try to pry into the private affairs of others by asking what\r\ntheir profits are, what things cost, whether Melissa ever had a beau,\r\nand why Amarette never got married? All such questions are extremely\r\nimpertinent and are likely to meet with rebuke.\r\n\r\nDo not whisper in company; do not engage in private conversation; do\r\nnot speak a foreign language which the general company present may not\r\nunderstand, unless it is understood that the foreigner is unable to\r\nspeak your own language.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WIDOWER JONES AND WIDOW SMITH.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE TOILET.\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nThe Care of the Person.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT RULES.\r\n\r\n1. GOOD APPEARANCE.--The first care of all persons should be for\r\ntheir personal appearance. Those who are slovenly or careless in their\r\nhabits are unfit for refined society, and cannot possibly make a good\r\nappearance in it. A well-bred person will always cultivate habits\r\nof the most scrupulous neatness. A gentleman or lady is always well\r\ndressed. The garment may be plain or of coarse material, or even worn\r\n\"thin and shiny,\" but if it is carefully brushed and neat, it can be\r\nworn with dignity.\r\n\r\n2. PERSONAL CLEANLINESS.--Personal appearance depends greatly on the\r\ncareful toilet and scrupulous attention to dress. The first point\r\nwhich marks the gentleman or lady in appearance is rigid cleanliness.\r\nThis remark supplies to the body and everything which covers it. A\r\nclean skin--only to be secured by frequent baths--is indispensable.\r\n\r\n3. THE TEETH.--The teeth should receive the utmost attention. Many\r\na young man has been disgusted with a lady by seeing her unclean and\r\ndiscolored teeth. It takes but a few moments, and if necessary secure\r\nsome simple tooth powder or rub the teeth thoroughly every day with a\r\nlinen handkerchief, and it will give the teeth and mouth a beautiful\r\nand clean appearance.\r\n\r\n4. THE HAIR AND BEARD.--The hair should be thoroughly brushed and well\r\nkept, and the beard of men properly trimmed. Men should not let their\r\nhair grow long and shaggy.\r\n\r\n5. UNDERCLOTHING.--The matter of cleanliness extends to all articles\r\nof clothing, underwear as well as the outer clothing. Cleanliness is\r\na mark of true utility. The clothes need not necessarily be of a rich\r\nand expensive quality, but they can all be kept clean. Some persons\r\nhave an odor about them that is very offensive, simply on account of\r\ntheir underclothing being worn too long without washing. This odor of\r\ncourse cannot be detected by the person who wears the soiled garments,\r\nbut other persons easily detect it and are offended by it.\r\n\r\n6. THE BATH.--No person should think for a moment that they can be\r\npopular in society without regular bathing. A bath should be taken\r\nat least once a week, and if the feet perspire they should be washed\r\nseveral times a week, as the case may require. It is not unfrequent\r\nthat young men are seen with dirty ears and neck. This is unpardonable\r\nand boorish, and shows gross neglect. Occasionally a young lady will\r\nbe called upon unexpectedly when her neck and smiling face are\r\nnot emblems of cleanliness. Every lady owes it to herself to be\r\nfascinating; every gentleman is bound, for his own sake, to be\r\npresentable; but beyond this there is the obligation to society, to\r\none's friends, and to those with whom we may be brought in contact.\r\n\r\n7. SOILED GARMENTS.--A young man's garments may not be expensive, yet\r\nthere is no excuse for wearing a soiled collar and a soiled shirt, or\r\ncarrying a soiled handkerchief. No one should appear as though he\r\nhad slept in a stable, shaggy hair, soiled clothing or garments\r\nindifferently put on and carelessly buttoned. A young man's vest\r\nshould always be kept buttoned in the presence of ladies. 8. THE\r\nBREATH.--Care should be taken to remedy an offensive breath without\r\ndelay. Nothing renders one so unpleasant to one's acquaintance, or\r\nis such a source of misery to one's self. The evil may be from some\r\nderangement of the stomach or some defective condition of the teeth,\r\nor catarrhal affection of the throat and nose. See remedies in other\r\nportions of the book.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA YOUNG MAN'S PERSONAL APPEARANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDress changes the manners.--VOLTAIRE.\r\n\r\nWhose garments wither, shall receive faded smiles.--SHERIDAN KNOWLES.\r\n\r\nMen of sense follow fashion so far that they are neither conspicuous\r\nfor their excess nor peculiar by their opposition to it.--ANONYMOUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A well-dressed man does not require so much an extensive as a\r\nvaried wardrobe. He does not need a different suit for every season\r\nand every occasion, but if he is careful to select clothes that are\r\nsimple and not striking or conspicuous, he may use the garment over\r\nand over again without their being noticed, provided they are suitable\r\nto the season and the occasion.\r\n\r\n2. A clean shirt, collar and cuffs always make a young man look neat\r\nand tidy, even if his clothes are not of the latest pattern and are\r\nsomewhat threadbare.\r\n\r\n3. Propriety is outraged when a man of sixty dresses like a youth\r\nor sixteen. It is bad manners for a gentleman to use perfumes to a\r\nnoticeable extent. Avoid affecting singularity in dress. Expensive\r\nclothes are no sign of a gentleman.\r\n\r\n4. When dressed for company, strive to appear easy and natural.\r\nNothing is more distressing to a sensitive person, or more ridiculous\r\nto one gifted with refinement, than to see a lady laboring under the\r\nconsciousness of a fine gown or a gentleman who is stiff, awkward and\r\nungainly in a brand-new coat.\r\n\r\n5. Avoid what is called the \"ruffianly style of dress\" or the slouchy\r\nappearance of a half-unbottoned vest, and suspenderless pantaloons.\r\nThat sort of affectation is, if possible, even more disgusting than\r\nthe painfully elaborate frippery of the dandy or dude. Keep your\r\nclothes well brushed and keep them cleaned. Slight spots can be\r\nremoved with a little sponge and soap and water.\r\n\r\n6. A gentleman should never wear a high hat unless he has on a frock\r\ncoat or a dress suit.\r\n\r\n7. A man's jewelry should be good and simple. Brass or false\r\njewelry, like other forms of falsehood, is vulgar. Wearing many cheap\r\ndecorations is a serious fault.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DUDE OF THE 17TH CENTURY.]\r\n\r\n8. If a man wears a ring it should be on the third finger of the left\r\nhand. This is the only piece of jewelry a man is allowed to wear that\r\ndoes not serve a purpose.\r\n\r\n9. Wearing imitations of diamonds is always in very bad taste.\r\n\r\n10. Every man looks better in a full beard if he keeps it well\r\ntrimmed. If a man shaves he should shave at least every other day,\r\nunless he is in the country.\r\n\r\n11. The finger-nails should be kept cut, and the teeth should be\r\ncleaned every morning, and kept clear from tarter. A man who does\r\nnot keep his teeth clean does not look like a gentleman when he shows\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  We sacrifice to dress, till household joys\r\n  And comforts cease. Dress drains our cellar dry,\r\n  And keeps our larder lean. Puts out our fires,\r\n  And introduces hunger, frost and woe,\r\n  Where peace and hospitality might reign.\r\n  --COWPER\r\n\r\n\r\n1. GOD IS A LOVER OF DRESS.--We cannot but feel that God is a lover\r\nof dress. He has put on robes of beauty and glory upon all his works.\r\nEvery flower is dressed in richness; every field blushes beneath a\r\nmantle of beauty; every star is veiled in brightness; every bird is\r\nclothed in the habiliments of the most exquisite taste. The cattle\r\nupon the thousand hills are dressed by the hand divine. Who, studying\r\nGod in his works, can doubt, that he will smile upon the evidence of\r\ncorrect taste manifested by his children in clothing the forms he has\r\nmade them?\r\n\r\n2. LOVE OF DRESS.--To love dress is not to be a slave of fashion; to\r\nlove dress only is the test of such homage. To transact the business\r\nof charity in a silken dress, and to go in a carriage to the work,\r\ninjures neither the work nor the worker. The slave of fashion is one\r\nwho assumes the livery of a princess, and then omits the errand of the\r\ngood human soul; dresses in elegance, and goes upon no good errand,\r\nand thinks and does nothing of value to mankind.\r\n\r\n3. BEAUTY IN DRESS.--Beauty in dress is a good thing, rail at it who\r\nmay. But it is a lower beauty, for which a higher beauty should not\r\nbe sacrificed. They love dresses too much who give it their first\r\nthought, their best time, or all their money; who for it neglect\r\nthe culture of their mind or heart, or the claims of others on their\r\nservice; who care more for their dress than their disposition; who are\r\ntroubled more by an unfashionable bonnet than a neglected duty.\r\n\r\n4. SIMPLICITY OF DRESS.--Female lovliness never appears to so good\r\nadvantage as when set off by simplicity of dress. No artist ever decks\r\nhis angels with towering feathers and gaudy jewelry; and our dear\r\nhuman angels--if they would make good their title to that name--should\r\ncarefully avoid ornaments, which properly belong to Indian squaws and\r\nAfrican princesses. These tinselries may serve to give effect on the\r\nstage, or upon the ball room floor, but in daily life there is no\r\nsubstitute for the charm of simplicity. A vulgar taste is not to\r\nbe disguised by gold or diamonds. The absence of a true taste and\r\nrefinement of delicacy cannot be compensated for by the possession of\r\nthe most princely fortune. Mind measures gold, but gold cannot measure\r\nmind. Through dress the mind may be read, as through the delicate\r\ntissue the lettered page. A modest woman will dress modestly; a really\r\nrefined and intelligent woman will bear the marks of careful selection\r\nand faultless taste.\r\n\r\n5. PEOPLE OF SENSE.--A coat that has the mark of use upon it, is a\r\nrecommendation to the people of sense, and a hat with too much nap,\r\nand too high lustre, a derogatory circumstance. The best coats in\r\nour streets are worn on the backs of penniless fops, broken down\r\nmerchants, clerks with pitiful salaries, and men that do not pay\r\nup. The heaviest gold chains dangle from the fobs of gamblers and\r\ngentlemen of very limited means; costly ornaments on ladies, indicate\r\nto the eyes that are well opened, the fact of a silly lover or husband\r\ncramped for funds.\r\n\r\n6. PLAIN AND NEAT.--When a pretty woman goes by in plain and neat\r\napparel, it is the presumption that she has fair expectations, and\r\na husband that can show a balance in his favor. For women are like\r\nbooks,--too much gilding makes men suspicious, that the binding is the\r\nmost important part. The body is the shell of the soul, and the dress\r\nis the husk of the body; but the husk generally tells what the kernel\r\nis. As a fashionably dressed young lady passed some gentlemen, one of\r\nthem raised his hat, whereupon another, struck by the fine appearance\r\nof the lady, made some inquiries concerning her, and was answered\r\nthus: \"She makes a pretty ornament in her father's house, but\r\notherwise is of no use.\"\r\n\r\n7. THE RICHEST DRESS.--The richest dress is always worn on the soul.\r\nThe adornments that will not perish, and that all men most admire,\r\nshine from the heart through this life. God has made it our highest,\r\nholiest duty, to dress the souls he has given us. It is wicked to\r\nwaste it in frivolity. It is a beautiful, undying, precious thing. If\r\nevery young woman would think of her soul when she looks in the\r\nglass, would hear the cry of her naked mind when she dallies away her\r\nprecious hours at her toilet, would listen to the sad moaning of her\r\nhollow heart, as it wails through her idle, useless life, something\r\nwould be done for the elevation of womanhood.\r\n\r\n8. DRESSING UP.--Compare a well-dressed body with a well-dressed mind.\r\nCompare a taste for dress with a taste for knowledge, culture,\r\nvirtue, and piety. Dress up an ignorant young woman in the \"height of\r\nfashion\"; put on plumes and flowers, diamonds and gewgaws; paint her\r\nface, girt up her waist, and I ask you, if this side of a painted and\r\nfeathered savage you can find anything more unpleasant to behold. And\r\nyet such young women we meet by the hundred every day on the street\r\nand in all our public places. It is awful to think of.\r\n\r\n9. DRESS AFFECTS OUR MANNERS.--A man who is badly dressed, feels\r\nchilly, sweaty, and prickly. He stammers, and does not always tell the\r\ntruth. He means to, perhaps, but he can't. He is half distracted about\r\nhis pantaloons, which are much to short, and are constantly hitching\r\nup; or his frayed jacket and crumpled linen harrow his soul, and quite\r\nunman him. He treads on the train of a lady's dress, and says, \"Thank\r\nyou\", sits down on his hat, and wishes the \"desert were his dwelling\r\nplace.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBEAUTY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"She walks in beauty, like the night\r\n  Of cloudless climes and starry skies:\r\n  And all that's best of dark and bright\r\n  Meet her in aspect and in her eyes;\r\n  Thus mellowed to that tender light\r\n  Which heaven to gaudy day denies.\"\r\n  --BYRON.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE HIGHEST STYLE OF BEAUTY.--The highest style of beauty to be\r\nfound in nature pertains to the human form, as animated and lighted\r\nup by the intelligence within. It is the expression of the soul that\r\nconstitutes this superior beauty. It is that which looks out of the\r\neye, which sits in calm majesty on the brow, lurks on the lip, smiles\r\non the cheek, is set forth in the chiselled lines and features of\r\nthe countenance, in the general contour of figure and form, in\r\nthe movement, and gesture, and tone; it is this looking out of the\r\ninvisible spirit that dwells within, this manifestation of the higher\r\nnature, that we admire and love; this constitutes to us the beauty of\r\nour species.\r\n\r\n2. BEAUTY WHICH PERISHES NOT.--There is a beauty which perishes not.\r\nIt is such as the angels wear. It forms the washed white robes of the\r\nsaints. It wreathes the countenance of every doer of good. It adorns\r\nevery honest face. It shines in the virtuous life. It molds the hands\r\nof charity. It sweetens the voice of sympathy. It sparkles on the brow\r\nof wisdom. It flashes in the eye of love. It breathes in the spirit of\r\npiety. It is the beauty of the heaven of heavens. It is that which may\r\ngrow by the hand of culture in every human soul. It is the flower of\r\nthe spirit which blossoms on the tree of life. Every soul may plant\r\nand nurture it in its own garden, in its own Eden.\r\n\r\n3. WE MAY ALL BE BEAUTIFUL.--This is the capacity of beauty that God\r\nhas given to the human soul, and this the beauty placed within\r\nthe reach of all. We may all be beautiful. Though our forms may\r\nbe uncomely and our features not the prettiest, our spirits may be\r\nbeautiful. And this inward beauty always shines through. A beautiful\r\nheart will flash out in the eye. A lovely soul will glow in the face.\r\nA sweet spirit will tune the voice, wreathe the countenance in charms.\r\nOh, there is a power in interior beauty that melts the hardest heart!\r\n\r\n4. WOMAN THE MOST PERFECT TYPE OF BEAUTY.--Woman, by common consent,\r\nwe regard as the most perfect type of beauty on earth. To her we\r\nascribe the highest charms belonging to this wonderful element so\r\nprofusely mingled in all God's works. Her form is molded and finished\r\nin exquisite delicacy of perfection. The earth gives us no form\r\nmore perfect, no features more symmetrical, no style more chaste, no\r\nmovements more graceful, no finish more complete; so that our artists\r\never have and ever will regard the woman-form of humanity as the\r\nmost perfect earthly type of beauty. This form is most perfect and\r\nsymmetrical in the youth of womanhood; so that the youthful woman is\r\nearth's queen of beauty. This is true, not only by the common consent\r\nof mankind, but also by the strictest rules of scientific criticism.\r\n\r\n5. FADELESS BEAUTY.--There cannot be a picture without its bright\r\nspots; and the steady contemplation of what is bright in others, has\r\na reflex influence upon the beholder. It reproduces what it reflects.\r\nNay, it seems to leave an impress even upon the countenance. The\r\nfeature, from having a dark, sinister aspect, becomes open, serene,\r\nand sunny. A countenance so impressed, has neither the vacant stare of\r\nthe idiot, nor the crafty, penetrating look of the basilisk, but the\r\nclear, placid aspect of truth and goodness. The woman who has such\r\na face is beautiful. She has a beauty which changes not with the\r\nfeatures, which fades not with years. It is beauty of expression. It\r\nis the only kind of beauty which can be relied upon for a permanent\r\ninfluence with the other sex. The violet will soon cease to smile.\r\nFlowers must fade. The love that has nothing but beauty to sustain it,\r\nsoon withers away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAND IN HAND.]\r\n\r\n6. A PRETTY WOMAN PLEASES THE EYE, a good woman, the heart. The one\r\nis a jewel, the other a treasure. Invincible fidelity, good humor, and\r\ncomplacency of temper, outlive all the charms of a fine face, and make\r\nthe decay of it invisible. That is true beauty which has not only\r\na substance, but a spirit; a beauty that we must intimately know to\r\njustly appreciate.\r\n\r\n7. THE WOMAN YOU LOVE BEST.--Beauty, dear reader, is probably the\r\nwoman you love best, but we trust it is the beauty of soul and\r\ncharacter, which sits in calm majesty on the brow, lurks on the lip,\r\nand will outlive what is called a fine face.\r\n\r\n8. THE WEARING OF ORNAMENTS.--Beauty needs not the foreign aid\r\nof ornament, but is when unadorned adorned the most, is a trite\r\nobservation; but with a little qualification it is worthy of general\r\nacceptance. Aside from the dress itself, ornaments should be very\r\nsparingly used--at any rate, the danger lies in over-loading oneself,\r\nand not in using too few. A young girl, and especially one of a light\r\nand airy style of beauty, should never wear gems. A simple flower\r\nin her hair or on her bosom is all that good taste will permit. When\r\njewels or other ornaments are worn, they should be placed where you\r\ndesire the eye of the spectator to rest, leaving the parts to which\r\nyou do not want attention called as plain and negative as possible.\r\nThere is no surer sign of vulgarity than a profusion of heavy jewelry\r\ncarried about upon the person.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSENSIBLE HELPS TO BEAUTY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. FOR SCRAWNY NECK.--Take off your tight collars, feather boas and\r\nsuch heating things. Wash neck and chest with hot water, then rub in\r\nsweet oil all that you can work in. Apply this every night before you\r\nretire and leave the skin damp with it while you sleep.\r\n\r\n2. FOR RED HANDS.--Keep your feet warm by soaking them often in hot\r\nwater, and keep your hands out of the water as much as possible. Rub\r\nyour hands with the skin of a lemon and it will whiten them. If your\r\nskin will bear glycerine after you have washed, pour into the palm\r\na little glycerine and lemon juice mixed, and rub over the hands and\r\nwipe off.\r\n\r\n3. NECK AND FACE.--Do not bathe the neck and face just before or after\r\nbeing out of doors. It tends to wrinkle the skin.\r\n\r\n4. SCOWLS.--Never allow yourself to scowl, even if the sun be in your\r\neyes. That scowl will soon leave its trace and no beauty will outlive\r\nit.\r\n\r\n5. WRINKLED FOREHEAD.--If you wrinkle your forehead when you talk\r\nor read, visit an oculist and have your eyes tested, and then wear\r\nglasses to fit them.\r\n\r\n6. OLD LOOKS.--Sometimes your face looks old because it is tired. Then\r\napply the following wash and it will make you look younger: Put three\r\ndrops of ammonia, a little borax, a tablespoonful of bay rum, and a\r\nfew drops of camphor into warm water and apply to your face. Avoid\r\ngetting it into your eyes.\r\n\r\n7. THE BEST COSMETIC.--Squeeze the juice of a lemon into a pint of\r\nsweet milk. Wash the face with it every night and in the morning wash\r\noff with warm rain water. This will produce a very beautiful effect\r\nupon the skin.\r\n\r\n8. SPOTS ON THE FACE.--Moles and many other discolorations may be\r\nremoved from the face by a preparation composed of one part chemically\r\npure carbolic acid and two parts pure glycerine. Touch the spots with\r\na camel's-hair pencil, being careful that the preparation does not\r\ncome in contact with the adjacent skin. Five minutes after touching,\r\nbathe with soft water and apply a little vaseline. It may be necessary\r\nto repeat the operation, but if persisted in, the blemishes will be\r\nentirely removed.\r\n\r\n9. WRINKLES.--This prescription is said to cure wrinkles: Take one\r\nounce of white wax and melt it to a gentle heat. Add two ounces of the\r\njuice of lily bulbs, two ounces of honey, two drams of rose water,\r\nand a drop or two of ottar of roses. Apply twice a day, rubbing the\r\nwrinkles the wrong way. Always use tepid water for washing the face.\r\n\r\n10. THE HAIR.--The hair must be kept free from dust or it will fall\r\nout. One of the best things for cleaning it, is a raw egg rubbed into\r\nthe roots and then washed out in several waters. The egg furnishes\r\nmaterial for the hair to grow on, while keeping the scalp perfectly\r\nclean. Apply once a month.\r\n\r\n11. LOSS OF HAIR.--When through sickness or headache the hair falls\r\nout, the following tonic may be applied with good effect: Use one\r\nounce of glycerine, one ounce of bay rum, one pint of strong sage tea,\r\nand apply every other night rubbing well into the scalp.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHOW TO KEEP THE BLOOM AND GRACE OF YOUTH.\r\n\r\nTHE SECRET OF ITS PRESERVATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. WM. McKINLEY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The question most often asked by women is regarding the art of\r\nretaining, with advancing years, the bloom and grace of youth. This\r\nsecret is not learned through the analysis of chemical compounds,\r\nbut by a thorough study of nature's laws peculiar to their sex. It is\r\nuseless for women with wrinkled faces, dimmed eyes and blemished skins\r\nto seek for external applications of beautifying balms and lotions\r\nto bring the glow of life and health into the face, and yet there are\r\ntruths, simple yet wonderful, whereby the bloom of early life can\r\nbe restored and retained, as should be the heritage of all God's\r\nchildren, sending the light of beauty into every woman's face. The\r\nsecret:\r\n\r\n2. Do not bathe in hard water; soften it with a few drops of ammonia,\r\nor a little borax.\r\n\r\n3. Do not bathe the face while it is very warm, and never use very\r\ncold water.\r\n\r\n4. Do not attempt to remove dust with cold water; give your face a hot\r\nbath, using plenty of good soap, then give it a thorough rinsing with\r\nwarm water.\r\n\r\n5. Do not rub your face with a coarse towel.\r\n\r\n6. Do not believe you can remove wrinkles by filling in the crevices\r\nwith powder. Give your face a Russian bath every night; that is, bathe\r\nit with water so hot that you wonder how you can bear it, and then,\r\na minute after, with moderately cold water, that will make your face\r\nglow with warmth; dry it with a soft towel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MALE. FEMALE. Showing the Difference in Form and\r\nProportion.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFORM AND DEFORMITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. PHYSICAL DEFORMITIES.--Masquerading is a modern accomplishment.\r\nGirls wear tight shoes, burdensome skirts, corsets, etc., all of which\r\nprove so fatal to their health. At the age of seventeen or eighteen,\r\nour \"young ladies\" are sorry specimens of feminality; and palpitators,\r\ncosmetics and all the modern paraphernalia are required to make them\r\nappear fresh and blooming. Man is equally at fault. A devotee to all\r\nthe absurd devices of fashion, he practically asserts that \"dress\r\nmakes the man.\" But physical deformities are of far less importance\r\nthan moral imperfections.\r\n\r\n2. DEVELOPMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL.--It is not possible for human beings\r\nto attain their full stature of humanity, except by loving long\r\nand perfectly. Behold that venerable man! he is mature in judgment,\r\nperfect in every action and expression, and saintly in goodness. You\r\nalmost worship as you behold. What rendered him thus perfect? What\r\nrounded off his natural asperities, and moulded up his virtues? Love\r\nmainly. It permeated every pore, and seasoned every fibre of his\r\nbeing, as could nothing else. Mark that matronly woman. In the bosom\r\nof her family she is more than a queen and goddess combined. All her\r\nlooks and actions express the outflowing of some or all of the human\r\nvirtues. To know her is to love her. She became thus perfect, not in a\r\nday or year, but by a long series of appropriate means. Then by what?\r\nChiefly in and by love, which is specially adapted thus to develop\r\nthis maturity.\r\n\r\n3. PHYSICAL STATURE.--Men and women generally increase in stature\r\nuntil the twenty-fifth year, and it is safe to assume, that perfection\r\nof function is not established until maturity of bodily development\r\nis completed. The physical contour of these representations plainly\r\nexhibits the difference in structure, and also implies difference of\r\nfunction. Solidity and strength are represented by the organization of\r\nthe male, grace and beauty by that of the female. His broad shoulders\r\nrepresent physical power and the right of dominion, while her bosom is\r\nthe symbol of love and nutrition.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHOW TO DETERMINE A PERFECT HUMAN FIGURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proportions of the perfect human figure are strictly mathematical.\r\nThe whole figure is six times the length of the foot. Whether the form\r\nbe slender or plump, this rule holds good. Any deviation from it is a\r\ndeparture from the highest beauty of proportion. The Greeks made all\r\ntheir statues according to this rule. The face, from the highest point\r\nof the forehead, where the hair begins, to the end of the chin, is\r\none-tenth of the whole stature. The hand, from the wrist to the end\r\nof the middle finger, is the same. The chest is a fourth, and from the\r\nnipples to the top of the head is the same. From the top of the chest\r\nto the highest point of the forehead is a seventh. If the length of\r\nthe face, from the roots of the hair to the chin, be divided into\r\nthree equal parts, the first division determines the point where the\r\neyebrows meet, and the second the place of the nostrils. The navel is\r\nthe central point of the human body, and if a man should lie on his\r\nback with his arms and legs extended, the periphery of the circle\r\nwhich might be described around him, with the navel for its center,\r\nwould touch the extremities of his hands and feet. The height from\r\nthe feet to the top of the head is the same as the distance from the\r\nextremity of one hand to the extremity of the other when the arms are\r\nextended.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lady's Dress in the days of Greece.]\r\n\r\nThe Venus de Medici is considered the most perfect model of the female\r\nforms, and has been the admiration of the world for ages. Alexander\r\nWalker, after minutely describing this celebrated statue, says: \"All\r\nthese admirable characteristics of the female form, the mere existence\r\nof which in woman must, one is tempted to imagine, be even to herself,\r\na source of ineffable pleasure, these constitute a being worthy, as\r\nthe personification of beauty, of occupying the temples of Greece;\r\npresent an object finer, alas, than Nature even seems capable of\r\nproducing; and offer to all nations and ages a theme of admiration and\r\ndelight.\" Well might Thomson say:\r\n\r\n  So stands the statue that enchants the world,\r\n  So, bending, tries to vail the matchless boast--\r\n  The mingled beauties of exulting Greece.\r\n\r\nWe beg our readers to observe the form of the waist (evidently\r\ninnocent of corsets and tight dresses) of this model woman, and also\r\nthat of the Greek Slave in the accompanying outlines. These forms\r\nare such as unperverted nature and the highest art alike require.\r\nTo compress the waist, and thereby change its form, pushing the ribs\r\ninward, displacing the vital organs, and preventing the due expansion\r\nof the lungs, is as destructive to beauty as it is to health.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY, MYSTERY, BENEFITS AND INJURIES OF THE CORSET.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Corset in the 18th Century.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The origin of the corset is lost in remote antiquity. The figures\r\nof the early Egyptian women show clearly an artificial shape of the\r\nwaist produced by some style of corset. A similar style of dress must\r\nalso have prevailed among the ancient Jewish maidens; for Isaiah, in\r\ncalling upon the women to put away their personal adornments, says:\r\n\"Instead of a girdle there shall be a rent, and instead of a stomacher\r\n(corset) a girdle of sackcloth.\"\r\n\r\n2. Homer also tells us of the cestus or girdle of Venus, which was\r\nborrowed by the haughty Juno with a view to increasing her personal\r\nattractions, that Jupiter might be a more tractable and orderly\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n3. Coming down to the later times, we find the corset was used in\r\nFrance and England as early as the 12th century.\r\n\r\n4. The most extensive and extreme use of the corset occurred in the\r\n16th century, during the reign of Catherine de Medici of France and\r\nQueen Elizabeth of England. With Catherine de Medici a thirteen-inch\r\nwaist measurement was considered the standard of fashion, while a\r\nthick waist was an abomination. No lady could consider her figure of\r\nproper shape unless she could span her waist with her two hands. To\r\nproduce this result a strong rigid corset was worn night and day until\r\nthe waist was laced down to the required size. Then over this corset\r\nwas placed the steel apparatus shown in the illustration on next page.\r\nThis corset-cover reached from the hip to the throat, and produced a\r\nrigid figure over which the dress would fit with perfect smoothness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Steel Corset worn in Catherine's time.]\r\n\r\n5. During the 18th century corsets were largely made from a species\r\nof leather known as \"Bend,\" which was not unlike that used for shoe\r\nsoles, and measured nearly a quarter of an inch in thickness. One\r\nof the most popular corsets of the time was the corset and stomacher\r\nshown in the accompanying illustration.\r\n\r\n6. About the time of the French Revolution a reaction set in against\r\ntight lacing, and for a time there was a return to the early\r\nclassical Greek costume. This style of dress prevailed, with various\r\nmodifications, until about 1810 when corsets and tight lacing again\r\nreturned with threefold fury. Buchan, a prominent writer of this\r\nperiod, says that it was by no means uncommon to see \"a mother lay her\r\ndaughter down upon the carpet, and, placing her foot upon her back,\r\nbreak half a dozen laces in tightening her stays.\"\r\n\r\n7. It is reserved to our own time to demonstrate that corsets and\r\ntight lacing do not necessarily go hand in hand. Distortion and\r\nfeebleness are not beauty. A proper proportion should exist between\r\nthe size of the waist and the breadth of the shoulders and hips,\r\nand if the waist is diminished below this proportion, it suggests\r\ndisproportion and invalidism rather than grace and beauty.\r\n\r\n8. The perfect corset is one which possesses just that degree of\r\nrigidity which will prevent it from wrinkling, but will at the same\r\ntime allow freedom in the bending and twisting of the body. Corsets\r\nboned with whalebone, horn or steel are necessarily stiff, rigid and\r\nuncomfortable. After a few days' wear the bones or steels become bent\r\nand set in position, or, as more frequently happens, they break and\r\ncause injury or discomfort to the wearer.\r\n\r\n9. About seven years ago an article was discovered for the stiffening\r\nof corsets, which has revolutionized the corset industry of the world.\r\nThis article is manufactured from the natural fibers of the Mexican\r\nIxtle plant, and is known as Coraline. It consists of straight, stiff\r\nfibers like bristles bound together into a cord by being wound with\r\ntwo strands of thread passing in opposite directions. This produces an\r\nelastic fiber intermediate in stiffness between twine and whalebone.\r\nIt cannot break, but it possesses all the stiffness and flexibility\r\nnecessary to hold the corset in shape and prevent its wrinkling.\r\n\r\nWe congratulate the ladies of to-day upon the advantages they enjoy\r\nover their sisters of two centuries ago, in the forms and the graceful\r\nand easy curves of the corsets now made as compared with those of\r\nformer times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Forms of Corsets in the time of Elizabeth of England.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EGYPTIAN CORSET.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTIGHT-LACING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt destroys natural beauty and creates an unpleasant and irritable\r\ntemper. A tight-laced chest and a good disposition cannot go\r\ntogether. The human form has been molded by nature, the best shape is\r\nundoubtedly that which she has given it. To endeavor to render it more\r\nelegant by artificial means is to change it; to make it much smaller\r\nbelow and much larger above is to destroy its beauty; to keep it cased\r\nup in a kind of domestic cuirass is not only to deform it, but to\r\nexpose the internal parts to serious injury. Under such compression as\r\nis commonly practiced by ladies, the development of the bones, which\r\nare still tender, does not take place conformably to the intention\r\nof nature, because nutrition is necessarily stopped, and they\r\nconsequently become twisted and deformed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NATURAL WAIST. THE EFFECTS OF LACING.]\r\n\r\nThose who wear these appliances of tight-lacing often complain that\r\nthey cannot sit upright without them--are sometimes, indeed, compelled\r\nto wear them during all the twenty-four hours; a fact which proves to\r\nwhat extent such articles weaken the muscles of the trunk. The injury\r\ndoes not fall merely on the internal structure of the body, but also\r\non its beauty, and on the temper and feelings with which that beauty\r\nis associated. Beauty is in reality but another name for expression\r\nof countenance, which is the index of sound health, intelligence,\r\ngood feelings and peace of mind. All are aware that uneasy feelings,\r\nexisting habitually in the breast, speedily exhibit their signature\r\non the countenance, and that bitter thoughts or a bad temper spoil the\r\nhuman expression of its comeliness and grace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NATURAL HAIR.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE CARE OF THE HAIR.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE COLOR OF THE HAIR.--The color of the hair corresponds with that\r\nof the skin--being dark or black, with a dark complexion, and red or\r\nyellow with a fair skin. When a white skin is seen in conjunction\r\nwith black hair, as among the women of Syria and Barbary, the apparent\r\nexception arises from protection from the sun's rays, and opposite\r\ncolors are often found among people of one prevailing feature. Thus\r\nred-haired Jews are not uncommon, though the nation in general have\r\ndark complexion and hair.\r\n\r\n2. THE IMPERISHABLE NATURE OF HAIR.--The imperishable nature of hair\r\narises from the combination of salt and metals in its composition. In\r\nold tombs and on mummies it has been found in a perfect state, after\r\na lapse of over two thousand years. There are many curious accounts\r\nproving the indestructibility of the human hair.\r\n\r\n3. TUBULAR.--In the human family the hairs are tubular, the tubes\r\nbeing intersected by partitions, resembling in some degree the\r\ncellular tissue of plants. Their hollowness prevents incumbrance from\r\nweight, while their power of resistance is increased by having their\r\ntraverse sections rounded in form.\r\n\r\n4. CAUTIONS.--It is ascertained that a full head of hair, beard\r\nand whiskers, are a prevention against colds and consumptions.\r\nOccasionally, however, it is found necessary to remove the hair from\r\nthe head, in cases of fever or disease, to stay the inflammatory\r\nsymptoms, and to relieve the brain. The head should invariably be kept\r\ncool. Close night-caps are unhealthy, and smoking-caps and coverings\r\nfor the head within doors are alike detrimental to the free growth of\r\nthe hair, weakening it, and causing it to fall out.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO BEAUTIFY AND PRESERVE THE HAIR.\r\n\r\n1. TO BEAUTIFY THE HAIR.--Keep the head clean, the pores of the skin\r\nopen, and the whole circulatory system in a healthy condition, and you\r\nwill have no need of bear's grease (alias hog's lard). Where there\r\nis a tendency in the hair to fall off on account of the weakness or\r\nsluggishness of the circulation, or an unhealthy state of the skin,\r\ncold water and friction with a tolerably stiff brush are probably the\r\nbest remedial agents.\r\n\r\n2. BARBER'S SHAMPOOS.--Are very beneficial if properly prepared. They\r\nshould not be made too strong. Avoid strong shampoos of any kind.\r\nGreat caution should be exercised in this matter.\r\n\r\n3. CARE OF THE HAIR.--To keep the hair healthy, keep the head clean.\r\nBrush the scalp well with a stiff brush, while dry. Then wash with\r\ncastile soap, and rub into the roots bay rum, brandy or camphor\r\nwater. This done twice a month will prove beneficial. Brush the\r\nscalp thoroughly twice a week. Dampen the hair with soft water at the\r\ntoilet, and do not use oil.\r\n\r\n4. HAIR WASH.--Take one ounce of borax, half an ounce of camphor\r\npowder--these ingredients fine--and dissolve them in one quart of\r\nboiling water. When cool, the solution will be ready for use. Dampen\r\nthe hair frequently. This wash is said not only to cleanse and\r\nbeautify, but to strengthen the hair, preserve the color and prevent\r\nbaldness.\r\n\r\nANOTHER EXCELLENT WASH.--The best wash we know for cleansing and\r\nsoftening the hair is an egg beaten up and rubbed well into the hair,\r\nand afterwards washed out with several washes of warm water.\r\n\r\n5. THE ONLY SENSIBLE AND SAFE HAIR OIL.--The following is considered\r\na most valuable preparation: Take of extract of yellow Peruvian bark,\r\nfifteen grains; extract of rhatany root, eight grains; extract of\r\nburdoch root and oil of nutmegs (fixed), of each two drachms; camphor\r\n(dissolve with spirits of wine), fifteen grains; beef marrow, two\r\nounces; best olive oil, one ounce; citron juice, half a drachm;\r\naromatic essential oil, as much as sufficient to render it fragrant;\r\nmix and make into an ointment. Two drachms of bergamot, and a few\r\ndrops of attar of roses would suffice.\r\n\r\n6. HAIR WASH.--A good hair wash is soap and water, and the oftener it\r\nis applied the freer the surface of the head will be from scurf. The\r\nhair-brush should also be kept in requisition morning and evening.\r\n\r\n7. TO REMOVE SUPERFLUOUS HAIR.--With those who dislike the use of\r\narsenic, the following is used for removing superfluous hair from\r\nthe skin: Lime, one ounce; carbonate of potash, two ounces; charcoal\r\npowder, one drachm. For use, make it into a paste with a little warm\r\nwater, and apply it to the part, previously shaved close. As soon as\r\nit has become thoroughly dry, it may be washed off with a little warm\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n8. COLORING FOR EYELASHES AND EYEBROWS.--In eyelashes the chief\r\nelement of beauty consists in their being long and glossy; the\r\neyebrows should be finely arched and clearly divided from each other.\r\nThe most innocent darkener of the brow is the expressed juice of the\r\nelderberry, or a burnt clove.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAPANESE MOUSINE MAKING HER TOILET.]\r\n\r\n9. CRIMPING HAIR.--To make the hair stay in crimps, take five cents\r\nworth of gum arabic and add to it just enough boiling water to\r\ndissolve it. When dissolved, add enough alcohol to make it rather\r\nthin. Let this stand all night and then bottle it to prevent the\r\nalcohol from evaporating. This put on the hair at night, after it is\r\ndone up in papers or pins, will make it stay in crimp the hottest day,\r\nand is perfectly harmless.\r\n\r\n10. TO CURL THE HAIR.--There is no preparation that will make\r\nnaturally straight hair assume a permanent curl. The following will\r\nkeep the hair in curl for a short time: Take borax, two ounces; gum\r\narabic, one drachm; and hot water, not boiling, one quart; stir, and,\r\nas soon as the ingredients are dissolved, add three tablespoonfuls of\r\nstrong spirits of camphor. On retiring to rest, wet the hair with the\r\nabove liquid, and roll in twists of paper as usual. Do not disturb the\r\nhair until morning, when untwist and form into ringlets.\r\n\r\n11. FOR FALLING OR LOOSENING OF THE HAIR.--Take:\r\n  Alcohol, a half pint.\r\n  Salt, as much as will dissolve.\r\n  Glycerine, a tablespoonful.\r\n  Flour of sulphur, teaspoonful. Mix.\r\n\r\nRub on the scalp every morning.\r\n\r\n12. TO DARKEN THE HAIR WITHOUT BAD EFFECTS.--Take:\r\n  Blue vitriol (powdered), one drachm.\r\n  Alcohol, one ounce.\r\n  Essence of roses, ten drops.\r\n  Rain-water, a half-pint.\r\n\r\nShake together until they are thoroughly dissolved.\r\n\r\n13. GRAY HAIR.--There are no known means by which the hair can be\r\nprevented from turning gray, and none which can restore it to its\r\noriginal hue, except through the process of dyeing. The numerous \"hair\r\ncolor restorers\" which are advertised are chemical preparations\r\nwhich act in the manner of a dye or as a paint, and are nearly always\r\ndependent for their power on the presence of lead. This mineral,\r\napplied to the skin, for a long time, will lead to the most disastrous\r\nmaladies--lead-palsy, lead colic, and other symptoms of poisoning. It\r\nshould, therefore, never be used for this purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHOW TO CURE PIMPLES OR OTHER FACIAL ERUPTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. It requires self-denial to get rid of pimples, for persons troubled\r\nwith them will persist in eating fat meats and other articles of food\r\ncalculated to produce them. Avoid the use of rich gravies, or pastry,\r\nor anything of the kind in excess. Take all the out-door exercise you\r\ncan and never indulge in a late supper. Retire at a reasonable hour,\r\nand rise early in the morning. Sulphur to purify the blood may be\r\ntaken three times a week--a thimbleful in a glass of milk before\r\nbreakfast. It takes some time for the sulphur to do its work,\r\ntherefore persevere in its use till the humors, or pimples, or\r\nblotches, disappear. Avoid getting wet while taking the sulphur.\r\n\r\n2. TRY THIS RECIPE: Wash the face twice a day in warm water, and rub\r\ndry with a coarse towel. Then with a soft towel rub in a lotion made\r\nof two ounces of white brandy, one ounce of cologne, and one-half\r\nounce of liquor potasse. Persons subject to skin eruptions should\r\navoid very salty or fat food. A dose of Epsom salts occasionally might\r\nprove beneficial.\r\n\r\n3. Wash the face in a dilution of carbolic acid, allowing one\r\nteaspoonful to a pint of water. This is an excellent and purifying\r\nlotion, and may be used on the most delicate skins. Be careful about\r\nletting this wash get into the eyes.\r\n\r\n4. Oil of sweet almonds, one ounce; fluid potash, one drachm. Shake\r\nwell together, and then add rose water, one ounce; pure water, six\r\nounces. Mix. Rub the pimples or blotches for some minutes with a rough\r\ntowel, and then dab them with the lotion.\r\n\r\n5. Dissolve one ounce of borax, and sponge the face with it every\r\nnight. When there are insects, rub on flower of sulphur, dry after\r\nwashing, rub well and wipe dry; use plenty of castile soap.\r\n\r\n6. Dilute corrosive sublimate with oil of almonds. A few days'\r\napplication will remove them.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBLACK-HEADS AND FLESH WORMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A REGULAR FLESH WORM GREATLY MAGNIFIED.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a minute little creature, scientifically called _Demodex\r\nfolliculorum_, hardly visible to the naked eye, with comparatively\r\nlarge fore body, a more slender hind body and eight little stumpy\r\nprocesses that do duty as legs. No specialized head is visible,\r\nalthough of course there is a mouth orifice. These creatures live\r\non the sweat glands or pores of the human face, and owing to the\r\nappearance that they give to the infested pores, they are usually\r\nknown as \"black-heads.\" It is not at all uncommon to see an otherwise\r\npretty face disfigured by these ugly creatures, although the insects\r\nthemselves are nearly transparent white. The black appearance is\r\nreally due the accumulation of dirt which gets under the edges of\r\nthe skin of the enlarged sweat glands and cannot be removed in the\r\nordinary way by washing, because the abnormal, hardened secretion of\r\nthe gland itself becomes stained. These insects are so lowly organized\r\nthat it is almost impossible to satisfactory deal with them and\r\nthey sometimes cause the continual festering of the skin which they\r\ninhabit.\r\n\r\nREMEDY.--Press them out with a hollow key or with the thumb and\r\nfingers, and apply a mixture of sulphur and cream every evening. Wash\r\nevery morning with the best toilet soap, or wash the face with hot\r\nwater with a soft flannel at bedtime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A HEALTHY COMPLEXION.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLOVE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  But there's nothing half so sweet in life\r\n  As love's young dream.--MOORE.\r\n\r\n  All love is sweet,\r\n  Given or returned. Common as light is love,\r\n  And its familiar voice wearies not ever.--SHELLEY.\r\n\r\n  Doubt thou the stars are fire,\r\n  Doubt that the sun doth move;\r\n  Doubt truth to be a liar,\r\n  But never doubt I love.--SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\n  Let those love now who never loved before,\r\n  Let those that always loved now love the more.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. LOVE BLENDS YOUNG HEARTS.--Love blends young hearts in blissful\r\nunity, and, for the time, so ignores past ties and affections, as to\r\nmake willing separation of the son from his father's house, and the\r\ndaughter from all the sweet endearments of her childhood's home, to\r\ngo out together and rear for themselves an altar, around which shall\r\ncluster all the cares and delights, the anxieties and sympathies, of\r\nthe family relationship; this love, if pure, unselfish, and discreet,\r\nconstitutes the chief usefulness and happiness of human life.\r\n\r\n2. WITHOUT LOVE.--Without love there would be no organized households,\r\nand, consequently, none of that earnest endeavor for competence and\r\nrespectability, which is the mainspring to human effort; none of those\r\nsweet, softening, restraining and elevating influences of domestic\r\nlife, which can alone fill the earth with the glory of the Lord and\r\nmake glad the city of Zion. This love is indeed heaven upon earth; but\r\nabove would not be heaven without it; where there is not love, there\r\nis fear; but, \"love casteth out fear.\" And yet we naturally do offend\r\nwhat we most love.\r\n\r\n3. LOVE IS THE SUN OF LIFE.--Most beautiful in morning and evening,\r\nbut warmest and steadiest at noon. It is the sun of the soul. Life\r\nwithout love is worse than death; a world without a sun. The love\r\nwhich does not lead to labor will soon die out, and the thankfulness\r\nwhich does not embody itself in sacrifices is already changing to\r\ngratitude. Love is not ripened in one day, nor in many, nor even in\r\na human lifetime. It is the oneness of soul with soul in appreciation\r\nand perfect trust. To be blessed it must rest in that faith in the\r\nDivine which underlies every other motion. To be true, it must be\r\neternal as God himself.\r\n\r\n4. LOVE IS DEPENDENT.--Remember that love is dependent upon forms;\r\ncourtesy of etiquette guards and protects courtesy of heart. How many\r\nhearts have been lost irrevocably, and how many averted eyes and\r\ncold looks have been gained from what seemed, perhaps, but a trifling\r\nnegligence of forms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AGE COUNSELING YOUTH.]\r\n\r\n5. RADICAL DIFFERENCES.--Men and women should not be judged by the\r\nsame rules. There are many radical differences in their affectional\r\nnatures. Man is the creature of interest and ambition. His nature\r\nleads him forth into the struggle and bustle of the world. Love is but\r\nthe embellishment of his early life, or a song piped in the intervals\r\nof the acts. He seeks for fame, for fortune, for space in the world's\r\nthoughts, and dominion over his fellow-men. But a woman's whole life\r\nis a history of the affections. The heart is her world; it is there\r\nher ambition strives for empire; it is there her ambition seeks for\r\nhidden treasures. She sends forth her sympathies on adventure; she\r\nembarks her whole soul in the traffic of affection; and if shipwrecked\r\nher case is hopeless, for it is bankruptcy of the heart.\r\n\r\n6. WOMAN'S LOVE.--Woman's love is stronger than death; it rises\r\nsuperior to adversity, and towers in sublime beauty above the\r\nniggardly selfishness of the world. Misfortune cannot suppress it;\r\nenmity cannot alienate it; temptation cannot enslave it. It is\r\nthe guardian angel of the nursery and the sick bed; it gives an\r\naffectionate concord to the partnership of life and interest,\r\ncircumstances cannot modify it; it ever remains the same to sweeten\r\nexistence, to purify the cup of life, on the rugged pathway to the\r\ngrave, and melt to moral pliability the brittle nature of man. It is\r\nthe ministering spirit of home, hovering in soothing caresses over the\r\ncradle, and the death-bed of the household, and filling up the urn of\r\nall its sacred memories.\r\n\r\n7. A LADY'S COMPLEXION.--He who loves a lady's complexion, form and\r\nfeatures, loves not her true self, but her soul's old clothes. The\r\nlove that has nothing but beauty to sustain it, soon withers and dies.\r\nThe love that is fed with presents always requires feeding. Love, and\r\nlove only, is the loan for love. Love is of the nature of a burning\r\nglass, which, kept still in one place, fireth; changed often, it doth\r\nnothing. The purest joy we can experience in one we love, is to see\r\nthat person a source of happiness to others. When you are with the\r\nperson loved, you have no sense of being bored. This humble and\r\ntrivial circumstance is the great test--the only sure and abiding test\r\nof love.\r\n\r\n8. TWO SOULS COME TOGETHER.--When two souls come together, each\r\nseeking to magnify the other, each in subordinate sense worshiping\r\nthe other, each help the other; the two flying together so that each\r\nwing-beat of the one helps each wing-beat of the other--when two souls\r\ncome together thus, they are lovers. They who unitedly move themselves\r\naway from grossness and from earth, toward the throne of crystaline\r\nand the pavement golden, are, indeed, true lovers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOVE MAKING IN THE EARLY COLONIAL DAYS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CUPID'S CAPTURED VICTIM.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE POWER AND PECULIARITIES OF LOVE.\r\n\r\nLOVE IS A TONIC AND A REMEDY FOR DISEASE, MAKES PEOPLE LOOK YOUNGER,\r\nCREATES INDUSTRY, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"All thoughts, all passions, all desires.\r\n  Whatever stirs this mortal frame,\r\n  Are ministers of Love,\r\n  And feed his sacred flame.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1. It is a physiological fact long demonstrated that persons\r\npossessing a loving disposition borrow less of the cares of life, and\r\nalso live much longer than persons with a strong, narrow and selfish\r\nnature. Persons who love scenery, love domestic animals, show great\r\nattachment for all friends; love their home dearly and find interest\r\nand enchantment in almost everything have qualities of mind and heart\r\nwhich indicate good health and a happy disposition.\r\n\r\n2. Persons who love music and are constantly humming or whistling a\r\ntune, are persons that need not be feared, they are kind-hearted\r\nand with few exceptions possess a loving disposition. Very few good\r\nmusicians become criminals.\r\n\r\n3. Parents that cultivate a love among their children will find\r\nthat the same feeling will soon be manifested in their children's\r\ndisposition. Sunshine in the hearts of the parents will blossom in the\r\nlives of the children. The parent who continually cherishes a feeling\r\nof dislike and rebellion in his soul, cultivating moral hatred against\r\nhis fellow-man, will soon find the same things manifested by his\r\nson. As the son resembles his father in looks so he will to a certain\r\nextent resemble him in character. Love in the heart of the parent\r\nwill beget kindness and affection in the heart of a child. Continuous\r\nscolding and fretting in the home will soon make love a stranger.\r\n\r\n4. If you desire to cultivate love, create harmony in all your\r\nfeelings and faculties. Remember that all that is pure, holy and\r\nvirtuous in love flows from the deepest fountain of the human soul.\r\nPoison the fountain and you change virtue to vice, and happiness to\r\nmisery.\r\n\r\n5. Love strengthens health, and disappointment cultivates disease. A\r\nperson in love will invariably enjoy the best of health. Ninety-nine\r\nper cent. of our strong constitutioned men, now in physical ruin, have\r\nwrecked themselves on the breakers of an unnatural love. Nothing but\r\nright love and a right marriage will restore them to health.\r\n\r\n6. All men feel much better for going a courting, providing they\r\ncourt purely. Nothing tears the life out of man more than lust, vulgar\r\nthoughts and immoral conduct. The libertine or harlot has changed\r\nlove, God's purest gift to man, into lust. They cannot acquire love in\r\nits purity again, the sacred flame has vanished forever. Love is pure,\r\nand cannot be found in the heart of a seducer.\r\n\r\n7. A woman is never so bright and full of health as when deeply in\r\nlove. Many sickly and frail women are snatched from the clutches of\r\nsome deadly disease and restored to health by falling in love.\r\n\r\n8. It is a long established fact that married persons are healthier\r\nthan unmarried persons; thus it proves that health and happiness\r\nbelong to the home. Health depends upon mind. Love places the mind\r\ninto a delightful state and quickens every human function, makes the\r\nblood circulate and weaves threads of joy into cables of domestic\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n9. An old but true proverb: \"A true man loving one woman will speak\r\nwell of all women. A true woman loving one man will speak well of all\r\nmen. A good wife praises all men, but praises her husband most. A good\r\nman praises all women, but praises his wife most.\"\r\n\r\n10. Persons deeply in love become peculiarly pleasant, winning and\r\ntender. It is said that a musician can never excel or an artist do\r\nhis best until he has been deeply in love. A good orator, a great\r\nstatesman or great men in general are greater and better for having\r\nonce been thoroughly in love. A man who truly loves his wife and home\r\nis always a safe man to trust.\r\n\r\n11. Love makes people look younger in years. People in unhappy homes\r\nlook older and more worn and fatigued. A woman at thirty, well courted\r\nand well married, looks five or ten years younger than a woman of the\r\nsame age unhappily married. Old maids and bachelors always look older\r\nthan they are. A flirting widow always looks younger than an old maid\r\nof like age.\r\n\r\n12. Love renders women industrious and frugal, and a loving husband\r\nspends lavishly on a loved wife and children, though miserly towards\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n13. Love cultivates self-respect and produces beauty. Beauty in walk\r\nand beauty in looks; a girl in love is at her best; it brings out\r\nthe finest traits of her character, she walks more erect and is more\r\ngenerous and forgiving; her voice is sweeter and she makes happy all\r\nabout her. She works better, sings better and is better.\r\n\r\n14. Now in conclusion, a love marriage is the best life insurance\r\npolicy; it pays dividends every day, while every other insurance\r\npolicy merely promises to pay after death. Remember that statistics\r\ndemonstrate that married people outlive old maids and old bachelors by\r\na goodly number of years and enjoy healthier and happier lives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TURKISH WAY OF MAKING LOVE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PREPARING TO ENTERTAIN HER LOVER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONFIDENCE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAMATIVENESS OR CONNUBIAL LOVE.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. MULTIPLYING THE RACE.--Some means for multiplying our race is\r\nnecessary to prevent its extinction by death. Propagation and death\r\nappertain to man's earthly existence. If the Deity had seen fit to\r\nbring every member of the human family into being by a direct act of\r\ncreative power, without the agency of parents, the present wise and\r\nbenevolent arrangements of husbands and wives, parents and\r\nchildren, friends and neighbors, would have been superseded, and all\r\nopportunities for exercising parental and connubial love, in which\r\nso much enjoyment is taken, cut off. But the domestic feelings and\r\nrelations, as now arranged, must strike every philosophical observer\r\nas inimitably beautiful and perfect--as the offspring of infinite\r\nWisdom and Goodness combined.\r\n\r\n2. AMATIVENESS AND ITS COMBINATIONS constitute their origin,\r\ncounterpart, and main medium of manifestation. Its primary function\r\nis connubial love. From it, mainly, spring those feelings which\r\nexist between the sexes as such and result in marriage and offspring.\r\nCombined with the higher sentiments, it gives rise to all those\r\nreciprocal kind feelings and nameless courtesies which each sex\r\nmanifests towards the other; refining and elevating both, promoting\r\ngentility and politeness, and greatly increasing social and general\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\n3. RENDERS MEN MORE POLITE TO WOMEN.--So far from being in the least\r\ngross or indelicate, its proper exercise is pure, chaste, virtuous,\r\nand even an ingredient in good manners. It is this which renders men\r\nalways more polite towards women than to one another, and more refined\r\nin their society, and which makes women more kind, grateful, genteel\r\nand tender towards men than women. It makes mothers love their\r\nsons more than their daughters, and fathers more attached to their\r\ndaughters. Man's endearing recollections of his mother or wife form\r\nhis most powerful incentives to virtue, study, and good deeds, as well\r\nas restraints upon his vicious inclinations; and, in proportion as a\r\nyoung man is dutiful and affectionate to his mother, will he be fond\r\nof his wife; for, this faculty is the parent of both.\r\n\r\n4. ALL SHOULD CULTIVATE THE FACULTY OF AMATIVENESS OR CONNUBIAL\r\nLOVE.--Study the personal charms and mental accomplishments of the\r\nother sex by ardent admirers of beautiful forms, and study graceful\r\nmovements and elegant manners, and remember, much depends upon the\r\ntones and accents of the voice. Never be gruff if you desire to be\r\nwinning. Seek and enjoy and reciprocate fond looks and feelings.\r\nBefore you can create favorable impressions you must first be honest\r\nand sincere and natural, and your conquest will be sure and certain.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLOVE AND COMMON-SENSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Do not love her because she goes to the altar with her head full\r\nof book learning, her hands of no earthly use, save for the piano\r\nand brush; because she has no conception of the duties and\r\nresponsibilities of a wife; because she hates housework, hates its\r\neverlasting routine and ever recurring duties; because she hates\r\nchildren and will adopt every means to evade motherhood; because she\r\nloves her ease, loves to have her will supreme, loves, oh how well, to\r\nbe free to go and come, to let the days slip idly by, to be absolved\r\nfrom all responsibility, to live without labor, without care? Will you\r\nlove her selfish, shirking, calculating nature after twenty years of\r\nclose companionship?\r\n\r\n2. Do you love him because he is a man, and therefore, no matter how\r\nweak mentally, morally or physically he may be, he has vested in him\r\nthe power to save you from the ignominy of an old maid's existence?\r\nBecause you would rather be Mrs. Nobody, than make the effort to be\r\nMiss Somebody? because you have a great empty place in your head and\r\nheart that nothing but a man can fill? because you feel you cannot\r\nlive without him? God grant the time may never come when you cannot\r\nlive with him.\r\n\r\n3. Do you love her because she is a thoroughly womanly woman; for\r\nher tender sympathetic nature; for the jewels of her life, which are\r\nabsolute purity of mind and heart; for the sweet sincerity of her\r\ndisposition; for her loving, charitable thought; for her strength\r\nof character? because she is pitiful to the sinful, tender to the\r\nsorrowful, capable, self-reliant, modest, true-hearted? in brief,\r\nbecause she is the embodiment of all womanly virtues?\r\n\r\n4. Do you love him because he is a manly man; because the living and\r\noperating principle of his life is a tender reverence for all women;\r\nbecause his love is the overflow of the best part of his nature;\r\nbecause he has never soiled his soul with an unholy act or his\r\nlips with an oath; because mentally he is a man among men; because\r\nphysically he stands head and shoulders above the masses; because\r\nmorally he is far beyond suspicion, in his thought, word or deed?\r\nbecause his earnest manly consecrated life is a mighty power on God's\r\nside?\r\n\r\n5. But there always has been and always will be unhappy marriages\r\nuntil men learn what husbandhood means; how to care for that tenderly\r\nmatured, delicately constituted being, that he takes into his care\r\nand keeping. That if her wonderful adjusted organism is overtaxed\r\nand overburdened, her happiness, which is largely dependent upon her\r\nhealth, is destroyed.\r\n\r\n6. Until men give the women they marry the undivided love of their\r\nheart; until constancy is the key-note of a life which speaks\r\neloquently of clean thoughts and clean hearts.\r\n\r\n7. Until men and women recognize that self-control in a man, and\r\nmodesty in a woman, will bring a mutual respect that years of wedded\r\nlife will only strengthen. Until they recognize that love is the\r\npurest and holiest of all things known to humanity, will marriage\r\ncontinue to bring unhappiness and discontent, instead of that comfort\r\nand restful peace which all loyal souls have a right to expect and\r\nenjoy.\r\n\r\n8. Be sensible and marry a sensible, honest and industrious companion,\r\nand happiness through life will be your reward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CALLER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWHAT WOMEN LOVE IN MEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Women naturally love courage, force and firmness in men. The\r\nideal man in a woman's eye must be heroic and brave. Woman naturally\r\ndespises a coward, and she has little or no respect for a bashful man.\r\n\r\n2. Woman naturally loves her lord and master. Women who desperately\r\nobject to be overruled, nevertheless admire men who overrule them, and\r\nfew women would have any respect for a man whom they could completely\r\nrule and control.\r\n\r\n3. Man is naturally the protector of woman; as the male wild animal\r\nof the forest protects the female, so it is natural for man to protect\r\nhis wife and children, and therefore woman admires those qualities in\r\na man which make him a protector.\r\n\r\n4. LARGE MEN.--Women naturally love men of strength, size and fine\r\nphysique, a tall, large and strong man rather than a short, small and\r\nweak man. A woman always pities a weakly man, but rarely ever has any\r\nlove for him.\r\n\r\n5. SMALL AND WEAKLY MEN.--All men would be of good size in frame\r\nand flesh, were it not for the infirmities visited upon them by the\r\nindiscretion of parents and ancestors of generations before.\r\n\r\n6. YOUTHFUL SEXUAL EXCITEMENT.--There are many children born healthy\r\nand vigorous who destroy the full vigor of their generative organs\r\nin youth by self-abuse, and if they survive and marry, their children\r\nwill have small bones, small frames and sickly constitutions. It is\r\ntherefore not strange that instinct should lead women to admire men\r\nnot touched with these symptoms of physical debility.\r\n\r\n7. GENEROSITY.--Woman generally loves a generous man. Religion absorbs\r\na great amount of money in temples, churches, ministerial salaries,\r\netc., and ambition and appetite absorb countless millions, yet woman\r\nreceives more gifts from man than all these combined: she loves a\r\ngenerous giver. _Generosity and Gallantry_ are the jewels which she\r\nmost admires. A woman receiving presents from a man implies that she\r\nwill pay him back in love, and the woman who accepts a man's presents,\r\nand does not respect him, commits a wrong which is rarely ever\r\nforgiven.\r\n\r\n8. INTELLIGENCE.--Above all other qualities in man, woman admires\r\nhis intelligence. Intelligence is man's woman captivating card. This\r\ncharacter in woman is illustrated by an English army officer, as told\r\nby O.S. Fowler, betrothed in marriage to a beautiful, loving heiress,\r\nsummoned to India, who wrote back to her:\r\n\r\n\"I have lost an eye, a leg, an arm, and been so badly marred and\r\nbegrimmed besides, that you never could love this poor, maimed\r\nsoldier. Yet, I love you too well to make your life wretched by\r\nrequiring you to keep your marriage-vow with me, from which I hereby\r\nrelease you. Find among English peers one physically more perfect,\r\nwhom you can love better.\"\r\n\r\nShe answered, as all genuine women must answer:\r\n\r\n\"Your noble mind, your splendid talents, your martial prowess which\r\nmaimed you, are what I love. As long as you retain sufficient body to\r\ncontain the casket of your soul, which alone is what I admire, I love\r\nyou all the same, and long to make you mine forever.\"\r\n\r\n9. SOFT MEN.--All women despise soft and silly men more than all\r\nother defects in their character. Woman never can love a man\r\nwhose conversation is flat and insipid. Every man seeking woman's\r\nappreciation or love should always endeavor to show his intelligence\r\nand manifest an interest in books and daily papers. He should read\r\nbooks and inform himself so that he can talk intelligently upon\r\nthe various topics of the day. Even an ignorant woman always loves\r\nsuperior intelligence.\r\n\r\n10. SEXUAL VIGOR.--Women love sexual vigor in men. This is human\r\nnature. Weakly and delicate fathers have weak and puny children,\r\nthough the mother may be strong and robust. A weak mother often bears\r\nstrong children, if the father is physically and sexually vigorous.\r\nConsumption is often inherited from fathers, because they furnish the\r\nbody, yet more women die with it because of female obstructions. Hence\r\nwomen love passion in men, because it endows their offspring with\r\nstrong functional vigor.\r\n\r\n11. PASSIONATE MEN--The less passion any woman possesses, the more she\r\nprizes a strong passionate man. This is a natural consequence, for if\r\nshe married one equally passionless, their children would be poorly\r\nendowed or they would have none; she therefore admires him who makes\r\nup the deficiency. Hence very amorous men prefer quiet, modest and\r\nreserved women.\r\n\r\n12. HOMELY MEN are admired by women if they are large, strong and\r\nvigorous and possess a good degree of intelligence. Looks are trifles\r\ncompared with the other qualities which man may possess.\r\n\r\n13. YOUNG MAN, If you desire to win the love and admiration of young\r\nladies, first, be intelligent; read books and papers; remember what\r\nyou read, so you can talk about it. Second, be generous and do not\r\nshow a stingy and penurious disposition when in the company of ladies.\r\nThird, be sensible, original, and have opinions of your own and do not\r\nagree with everything that someone else says, or agree with everything\r\nthat a lady may say. Ladies naturally admire genteel and intelligent\r\ndiscussions and conversations when there is someone to talk with who\r\nhas an opinion of his own. Woman despises a man who has no opinion\r\nof his own; she hates a trifling disposition and admires leadership,\r\noriginal ideas, and looks up to man as a leader. Women despise all men\r\nwhom they can manage, overrule, cow-down and subdue.\r\n\r\n14. BE SELF-SUPPORTING.--The young man who gives evidence of thrift is\r\nalways in demand. Be enthusiastic and drive with success all that\r\nyou undertake. A young man, sober, honest and industrious, holding a\r\nresponsible position or having a business of his own, is a prize that\r\nsome bright and beautiful young lady would like to draw. Woman admires\r\na certainty.\r\n\r\n15. UNIFORMED MEN.--It is a well known fact that women love uniformed\r\nmen. The soldier figures as a hero in about every tale of fiction\r\nand it is said by good authority that a man in uniform has three more\r\nchances to marry than the man without uniform. The correct reason is,\r\nthe soldier's profession is bravery, and he is dressed and trained for\r\nthat purpose, and it is that which makes him admired by ladies rather\r\nthan the uniform which he wears. His profession is also that of a\r\nprotector.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWHAT MEN LOVE IN WOMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. FEMALE BEAUTY.--Men love beautiful women, for woman's beauty is\r\nthe highest type of all beauty. A handsome woman needs no diamonds, no\r\nsilks or satins; her brilliant face outshines diamonds and her form is\r\nbeautiful in calico.\r\n\r\n2. FALSE BEAUTIFIERS.--Man's love of female beauty surpasses all other\r\nlove, and whatever artificial means are used to beautify, to a certain\r\nextent are falsehoods which lead to distrust or dislike. Artificial\r\nbeauty is always an imitation, and never can come into competition\r\nwith the genuine. No art can successfully imitate nature.\r\n\r\n3. TRUE KIND OF BEAUTY.--Facial beauty is only skin deep. A beautiful\r\nform, a graceful figure, graceful movements and a kind heart are the\r\nstrongest charms in the perfection of female beauty. A brilliant face\r\nalways outshines what may be called a pretty face, for intelligence is\r\nthat queenly grace which crowns woman's influence over men. Good looks\r\nand good and pure conduct awaken a man's love for women. A girl must\r\ntherefore be charming as well as beautiful, for a charming girl will\r\nnever become a charmless wife.\r\n\r\n4. A GOOD FEMALE BODY.--No weakly, poor-bodied woman can draw a man's\r\nlove like a strong, well developed body. A round, plump figure with an\r\noverflow of animal life is the woman most commonly sought, for nature\r\nin man craves for the strong qualities in women, as the health and\r\nlife of offspring depend upon the physical qualities of wife\r\nand mother. A good body and vigorous health, therefore, become\r\nindispensable to female beauty.\r\n\r\n5. BROAD HIPS.--A woman with a large pelvis gives her a superior and\r\nsignificant appearance, while a narrow pelvis always indicate weak\r\nsexuality. The other portions of the body however must be in harmony\r\nwith the size and breadth of the hips.\r\n\r\n6. FULL BUSTS.--In the female beauty of physical development there\r\nis nothing that can equal full breasts. It is an indication of good\r\nhealth and good maternal qualities. As a face looks bad without a\r\nnose, so the female breast, when narrow and flat, produces a bad\r\neffect. The female breasts are the means on which a new-born child\r\ndepends for its life and growth, hence it is an essential human\r\ninstinct for men to admire those physical proportions in women which\r\nindicate perfect motherhood. Cotton and all other false forms simply\r\nshow the value of natural ones. All false forms are easily detected,\r\nbecause large natural ones will generally quiver and move at every\r\nstep, while the artificial ones will manifest no expression of life.\r\nAs woman looks so much better with artificial paddings and puffings\r\nthan she does without, therefore modern society should waive all\r\nobjections to their use. A full breast has been man's admiration\r\nthrough all climes and ages, and whether this breast-loving instinct\r\nis right or wrong, sensible or sensual, it is a fact well known to\r\nall, that it is a great disappointment to a husband and father to see\r\nhis child brought up on a bottle. Men love full breasts, because it\r\npromotes maternity. If, however, the breasts are abnormally large,\r\nit indicates maternal deficiency the same as any disproportion or\r\nextreme.\r\n\r\n7. SMALL FEET.--Small feet and small ankles are very attractive,\r\nbecause they are in harmony with a perfect female form, and men admire\r\nperfection. Small feet and ankles indicate modesty and reserve, while\r\nlarge feet and ankles indicate coarseness, physical power, authority,\r\npredominance. Feet and ankles however must be in harmony with the\r\nbody, as small feet and small ankles on a large woman would be out of\r\nproportion and consequently not beautiful.\r\n\r\n8. BEAUTIFUL ARMS.--As the arm is always in proportion with the other\r\nportions of the body, consequently a well-shaped arm, small hands and\r\nsmall wrists, with full muscular development, is a charm and beauty\r\nnot inferior to the face itself, and those who have well-shaped arms\r\nmay be proud of them, because they generally keep company with a fine\r\nbust and a fine figure.\r\n\r\n9. INTELLIGENCE.--A mother must naturally possess intelligence, in\r\norder to rear her children intelligently, consequently it is natural\r\nfor man to chiefly admire mental qualities in women, for utility and\r\npracticability depend upon intelligence. Therefore a man generally\r\nloves those charms in women which prepare her for the duties of\r\ncompanionship. If a woman desires to be loved, she must cultivate her\r\nintellectual gifts, be interesting and entertaining in society,\r\nand practical and helpful in the home, for these are some of the\r\nqualifications which make up the highest type of beauty.\r\n\r\n10. PIETY AND RELIGION IN WOMEN.--Men who love home and the\r\ncompanionship of their wives, love truth, honor and honesty. It is\r\nthis higher moral development that naturally leads them to admire\r\nwomen of moral and religious natures. It is therefore not strange that\r\nimmoral men love moral and church-loving wives. Man naturally admires\r\nthe qualities which tend to the correct government of the home. Men\r\nwant good and pure children, and it is natural to select women who\r\ninsure domestic contentment and happiness. A bad man, of course, does\r\nnot deserve a good wife, yet he will do his utmost to get one.\r\n\r\n11. FALSE APPEARANCE.--Men love reserved, coy and discreet women much\r\nmore than blunt, shrewd and boisterous. Falsehood, false hair, false\r\ncurls, false forms, false bosoms, false colors, false cheeks, and all\r\nthat is false, men naturally dislike, for in themselves they are a\r\npoor foundation on which to form family ties, consequently duplicity\r\nand hypocrisy in women is very much disliked by men, but a frank,\r\nhonest, conscientious soul is always lovable and lovely and will not\r\nbecome an old maid, except as a matter of choice and not of necessity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF MARRIAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. \"It is not good for man to be alone,\" was the Divine judgment, and\r\nso God created for him an helpmate; therefore sex is as Divine as the\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n2. POLYGAMY.--Polygamy has existed in all ages. It is and always has\r\nbeen the result of moral degradation and wantonness.\r\n\r\n3. THE GARDEN OF EDEN.--The Garden of Eden was no harem. Primeval\r\nnature knew no community of love; there was only the union of two\r\nsouls, and the twain were made one flesh. If God had intended man to\r\nbe a polygamist he would have created for him two or more wives; but\r\nhe only created one wife for the first man. He also directed Noah\r\nto take into the ark two of each sort--a male and female--another\r\nevidence that God believed in pairs only.\r\n\r\n4. ABRAHAM no doubt was a polygamist, and the general history of\r\npatriarchal life shows that the plurality of wives and concubinage\r\nwere national customs, and not the institutions authorized by God.\r\n\r\n5. EGYPTIAN HISTORY.--Egyptian history, in the first ostensible form\r\nwe have, shows that concubinage and polygamy were in common practice.\r\n\r\n6. SOLOMON.--It is not strange that Solomon, with his thousand wives,\r\nexclaimed: \"All is vanity and vexation of spirit.\" Polygamy is not the\r\nnatural state of man.\r\n\r\n7. CONCUBINAGE AND POLYGAMY continued till the fifth century, when\r\nthe degraded condition of woman became to some extent matters of some\r\nconcern and recognition. Before this woman was regarded simply as an\r\ninstrument of procreation, or a mistress of the household, to gratify\r\nthe passions of man.\r\n\r\n8. THE CHINESE marriage system was, and is, practically polygamous,\r\nfor from their earliest traditions we learn, although a man could\r\nhave but one wife, he was permitted to have as many concubines as he\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\n9. MOHAMMEDANISM.--Of the 150,000,000 Mohammedans all are polygamists.\r\nTheir religion appeals to the luxury of animal propensities, and the\r\nvoluptuous character of the Orientals has penetrated western Europe\r\nand Africa.\r\n\r\n10. MORMONISM.--The Mormon Church, founded by Joseph Smith, practiced\r\npolygamy until the beginning of 1893, when the church formally\r\ndeclared and resigned polygamy as a part or present doctrine of their\r\nreligious institution. Yet all Mormons are polygamists at heart. It is\r\na part of their religion; national law alone restrains them.\r\n\r\n11. FREE LOVERS.--There is located at Lenox, Madison County, New York,\r\nan organization popularly known as Free Lovers. The members advocate\r\na system of complex marriage, a sort of promiscuity, with a freedom\r\nof love for any and all. Man offers woman support and love;\r\nwoman enjoying freedom, self-respect, health, personal and mental\r\ncompetency, gives herself to man in the boundless sincerity of\r\nan unselfish union. In their system, love is made synonymous with\r\nsexuality, and there is no doubt, but what woman is only a plaything\r\nto gratify animal caprice.\r\n\r\n12. MONOGAMY (SINGLE WIFE), is a law of nature evident from the fact\r\nthat it fulfills the three essential conditions of man, viz.:\r\nthe development of the individual, the welfare of society and\r\nreproduction. In no nation with a system of polygamy do we find a code\r\nof political and moral rights, and the condition of woman is that of\r\na slave. In polygamous countries nothing is added to the education and\r\ncivilization. The natural tendency is sensualism, and sensualism tends\r\nto mental starvation.\r\n\r\n18. CHRISTIAN CIVILIZATION has lifted woman from slavery to liberty.\r\nWherever Christian civilization prevails there are legal marriages,\r\npure homes and education. May God bless the purity of the home.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMARRIAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Thus grief still treads upon the heel of pleasure,\r\n  Married in haste we may repent at leisure.\"\r\n  --SHAKESPEARE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parties are wedded. The priest or clergyman has pronounced as one\r\nthose hearts that before beat in unison with each other. The assembled\r\nguests congratulate the happy pair. The fair bride has left her dear\r\nmother bedewed with tears and sobbing just as if her heart would\r\nbreak, and as if the happy bridegroom was leading her away captive\r\nagainst her will. They enter the carriage. It drives off on the\r\nwedding tour, and his arms encircles the yielding waist of her now\r\nall his own, while her head reclines on the breast of the man of her\r\nchoice. If she be young and has married an old man, she will be sad.\r\nIf she has married for a home, or position, or wealth, a pang\r\nwill shoot across her fair bosom. If she has married without due\r\nconsideration or on too light an acquaintance, it will be her sorrow\r\nbefore long. But, if loving and beloved, she has united her destiny\r\nwith a worthy man, she will rejoice, and on her journey feel a glow\r\nof satisfaction and delight unfelt before and which will be often\r\nrenewed, and daily prove as the living waters from some perennial\r\nspring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE ADVANTAGES OF WEDLOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\n  'Tis sweet to hear the watch-dog's honest bark,\r\n  Bay deep-mouthed welcome as we draw near home\r\n  'Tis sweet to know there is an eye will mark\r\n  Our coming, and look brighter when we come.\r\n  BYRON, DON JUAN\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Marriage is the natural state of man and woman. Matrimony greatly\r\ncontributes to the wealth and health of man.\r\n\r\n2. Circumstances may compel a man not to select a companion until late\r\nin life. Many may have parents or relatives, dependent brothers and\r\nsisters to care for, yet family ties are cultivated; notwithstanding\r\nthe home is without a wife.\r\n\r\n3. In Christian countries the laws of marriage have greatly added to\r\nthe health of man. Marriage in barbarous countries, where little or no\r\nmarriage ceremonies are required, benefits man but little. There\r\ncan be no true domestic blessedness without loyalty and love for the\r\nselect and married companion. All the licentiousness and lust of a\r\nlibertine, whether civilized or uncivilized, bring him only unrest and\r\npremature decay.\r\n\r\n4. A man, however, may be married and not mated, and consequently reap\r\ntrouble and unhappiness. A young couple should first carefully\r\nlearn each other by making the courtship a matter of business, and\r\nsufficiently long that the disposition and temper of each may be\r\nthoroughly exposed and understood.\r\n\r\n5. First see that there is love; secondly, that there is adaptation;\r\nthirdly, see that there are no physical defects, and if these\r\nconditions are properly considered, cupid will go with you.\r\n\r\n6. The happiest place on all earth is home. A loving wife and lovely\r\nchildren are jewels without price, as Payne says:\r\n\r\n  \"'Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam.\r\n  Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home.\"\r\n\r\n7. Reciprocated love produces a general exhilaration of the system.\r\nThe elasticity of the muscles is increased, the circulation is\r\nquickened, and every bodily function is stimulated to renewed activity\r\nby a happy marriage.\r\n\r\n8. The consummation desired by all who experience this affection, is\r\nthe union of souls in a true marriage. Whatever of beauty or\r\nromance there may have been in the lover's dream, is enhanced and\r\nspiritualized in the intimate communion of married life. The crown of\r\nwifehood and maternity is purer, more divine than that of the maiden.\r\nPassion is lost--emotions predominate.\r\n\r\n9. TOO EARLY MARRIAGES.--Too early marriage is always bad for the\r\nfemale. If a young girl marries, her system is weakened and a full\r\ndevelopment of her body is prevented, and the dangers of confinement\r\nare considerably increased.\r\n\r\n10. Boys who marry young derive but little enjoyment from the\r\nconnubial state. They are liable to excesses and thereby lose much of\r\nthe vitality and power of strength and physical endurance.\r\n\r\n11. LONG LIFE.--Statistics show that married men live longer than\r\nbachelors. Child-bearing for women is conducive to longevity.\r\n\r\n12. COMPLEXION.--Marriage purifies the complexion, removes blotches\r\nfrom the skin, invigorates the body, fills up the tones of the voice,\r\ngives elasticity and firmness to the step, and brings health and\r\ncontentment to old age.\r\n\r\n13. TEMPTATIONS REMOVED.--Marriage sanctifies a home, while adultery\r\nand libertinism produce unrest, distrust and misery. It must\r\nbe remembered that a married man can practice the most absolute\r\ncontinence and enjoy a far better state of health than the licentious\r\nman. The comforts of companionship develop purity and give rest to the\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n14. TOTAL ABSTENTION.--It is no doubt difficult for some men to fully\r\nabstain from sexual intercourse and be entirely chaste in mind.\r\nThe great majority of men experience frequent strong sexual desire.\r\nAbstention is very apt to produce in their minds voluptuous images and\r\nuntamable desires which require an iron will to banish or control. The\r\nhermit in his seclusion, or the monk in his retreat, are often flushed\r\nwith these passions and trials. It is, however, natural; for remove\r\nthese passions and man would be no longer a man. It is evident that\r\nthe natural state of man is that of marriage; and he who avoids that\r\nstate is not in harmony with the laws of his being.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ALGERIAN BRIDE.]\r\n\r\n15. PROSTITUTION.--Men who inherit strong passions easily argue\r\nthemselves into the belief either to practice masturbation or visit\r\nplaces of prostitution, on the ground that their health demands it.\r\nThough medical investigation has proven it repeatedly to be false, yet\r\nmany believe it. The consummation of marriage involves the mightiest\r\nissues of life and is the most holy and sacred right recognized by\r\nman, and it is the Balm of Gilead for many ills. Masturbation or\r\nprostitution soon blight the brightest prospects a young man may have.\r\nManhood is morality and purity of purpose, not sensuality.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDISADVANTAGES OF CELIBACY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. To live the life of a bachelor has many advantages and many\r\ndisadvantages. The man who commits neither fornication, adultery nor\r\nsecret vice, and is pure in mind, surely has all the moral virtues\r\nthat make a good man and a good citizen, whether married or unmarried.\r\n\r\n2. If a good pure-minded man does not marry, he will suffer no serious\r\nloss of vital power; there will be no tendency to spermatorrhoea or\r\ncongestion, nor will he be afflicted with any one of those ills which\r\ncertain vicious writers and quacks would lead many people to believe.\r\nCelibacy is perfectly consistent with mental vigor and physical\r\nstrength. Regularity in the habits of life will always have its good\r\neffects on the human body.\r\n\r\n3. The average life of a married man is much longer than that of a\r\nbachelor. There is quite an alarming odds in the United States in\r\nfavor of a man with a family. It is claimed that the married man lives\r\non an average from five to twenty years longer than a bachelor. The\r\nmarried man lives a more regular life. He has his meals more regularly\r\nand is better nursed in sickness, and in every way a happier and more\r\ncontented man. The happiness of wife and children will always add\r\ncomfort and length of days to the man who is happily married.\r\n\r\n4. It is a fact well answered by statistics that there is more crime\r\ncommitted, more vices practiced, and more immorality among single\r\nmen than among married men. Let the young man be pure in heart like\r\nBunyan's Pilgrim, and he can pass the deadly dens, the roaring lions,\r\nand overcome the ravenous fires of passion, unscathed. The vices of\r\nsingle men support the most flagrant of evils of modern society,\r\nhence let every young man beware and keep his body clean and pure. His\r\nfuture happiness largely depends upon his chastity while a single man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"MADE IN U.S.A.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I WILL NEVER MARRY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOLD MAIDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. MODERN ORIGIN.--The prejudice which certainly still exists in the\r\naverage mind against unmarried women must be of comparatively\r\nmodern origin. From the earliest ages to ancient Greece, and Rome\r\nparticularly, the highest honors were paid them. They were the\r\nministers of the old religions, and regarded with superstitious awe.\r\n\r\n2. MATRIMONY.--Since the reformation, especially during the last\r\ncentury, and in our own land, matrimony has been so much esteemed,\r\nnotably by women, that it has come to be regarded as in some sort\r\ndiscreditable for them to remain single. Old maids are mentioned on\r\nevery hand with mingled pity and disdain, arising no doubt from the\r\nbelief, conscious or unconscious, that they would not be what they\r\nare if they could help it. Few persons have a good word for them as\r\na class. We are constantly hearing of lovely maidens, charming wives,\r\nbuxom widows, but almost never of attractive old maids.\r\n\r\n3. DISCARDING PREJUDICE.--The real old maid is like any other woman.\r\nShe has faults necessarily, though not those commonly conceived\r\nof. She is often plump, pretty, amiable, interesting, intellectual,\r\ncultured, warm-hearted, benevolent, and has ardent friends of both\r\nsexes. These constantly wonder why she has not married, for they feel\r\nthat she must have had many opportunities. Some of them may know why;\r\nshe may have made them her confidantes. She usually has a sentimental,\r\nromantic, frequently a sad and pathetic past, of which she does not\r\nspeak unless in the sacredness of intimacy.\r\n\r\n4. NOT QUARRELSOME.--She is not dissatisfied, querulous nor envious.\r\nOn the contrary, she is, for the most part, singularly content,\r\npatient and serene,--more so than many wives who have household duties\r\nand domestic cares to tire and trouble them.\r\n\r\n5. REMAIN SINGLE FROM NECESSITY.--It is a stupid, as well as a heinous\r\nmistake, that women who remain single do so from necessity. Almost\r\nany woman can get a husband if she is so minded, as daily observation\r\nattests. When we see the multitudes of wives who have no visible signs\r\nof matrimonial recommendation, why should we think that old maids have\r\nbeen totally neglected? We may meet those who do not look inviting.\r\nBut we meet any number of wives who are even less inviting.\r\n\r\n6. FIRST OFFER.--The appearance and outgiving of many wives denote\r\nthat they have accepted the first offer; the appearance and outgiving\r\nof many old maids that they have declined repeated offers. It is\r\nundeniable, that wives, in the mass, have no more charm than old maids\r\nhave, in the mass. But, as the majority of women are married, they are\r\nno more criticised nor commented on, in the bulk, than the whole sex\r\nare. They are spoken of individually as pretty or plain, bright or\r\ndull, pleasant or unpleasant; while old maids are judged as a species,\r\nand almost always unfavorable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I HAVE CHANGED MY MIND.\"]\r\n\r\n7. BECOMES A WIFE.--Many an old maid, so-called, unexpectedly to her\r\nassociates becomes a wife, some man of taste, discernment and sympathy\r\nhaving induced her to change her state. Probably no other man of his\r\nkind has proposed before, which accounts for her singleness. After her\r\nmarriage hundreds of persons who had sneered at her condition find her\r\ncharming, thus showing the extent of their prejudice against feminine\r\ncelibacy. Old maids in general, it is fair to presume, do not wait for\r\nopportunities, but for proposers of an acceptable sort. They may have,\r\nindeed they are likely to have, those, but not to meet these.\r\n\r\n8. NO LONGER MARRY FOR SUPPORT.--The time has changed and women have\r\nchanged with it. They have grown more sensible, more independent\r\nin disposition as well as circumstances. They no longer marry for\r\nsupport; they have proved their capacity to support themselves, and\r\nself-support has developed them in every way. Assured that they can\r\nget on comfortably and contentedly alone they are better adapted by\r\nthe assurance for consortship. They have rapidly increased from this\r\nand cognate causes, and have so improved in person, mind and character\r\nthat an old maid of to-day is wholly different from an old maid of\r\nforty years ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONVINCING HIS WIFE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWHEN AND WHOM TO MARRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. EARLY MARRIAGES.--Women too early married always remain small in\r\nstature, weak, pale, emaciated, and more or less miserable. We have\r\nno natural nor moral right to perpetuate unhealthy constitutions,\r\ntherefore women should not marry too young and take upon themselves\r\nthe responsibility, by producing a weak and feeble generation of\r\nchildren. It is better not to consummate a marriage until a full\r\ndevelopment of body and mind has taken place. A young woman of\r\ntwenty-one to twenty-five, and a young man of twenty-three to\r\ntwenty-eight, are considered the right age in order to produce an\r\nintelligent and healthy offspring. \"First make the tree good, then\r\nshall the fruit be good also.\"\r\n\r\n2. If marriage is delayed too long in either sex, say from thirty\r\nto forty-five, the offspring will often be puny and more liable to\r\ninsanity, idiocy, and other maladies.\r\n\r\n3. PUBERTY.--This is the period when childhood passes from immaturity\r\nof the sexual functions to maturity. Woman attains this state a year\r\nor two sooner than man. In the hotter climates the period of puberty\r\nis from twelve to fifteen years of age, while in cold climates,\r\nsuch as Russia, the United States, and Canada, puberty is frequently\r\ndelayed until the seventeenth year.\r\n\r\n4. DISEASED PARENTS.--We do the race a serious wrong in multiplying\r\nthe number of hereditary invalids. Whole families of children have\r\nfallen heir to lives of misery and suffering by the indiscretion and\r\npoor judgment of parents. No young man in the vigor of health\r\nshould think for a moment of marrying a girl who has the impress\r\nof consumption or other disease already stamped upon her feeble\r\nconstitution. It only multiplies his own suffering, and brings no\r\nmaterial happiness to his invalid wife. On the other hand, no healthy,\r\nvigorous young woman ought to unite her destiny with a man, no matter\r\nhow much she adored him, who is not healthy and able to brave the\r\nhardships of life. If a young man or young woman with feeble body\r\ncannot find permanent relief either by medicine or change of climate,\r\nno thoughts of marriage should be entertained. Courting a patient may\r\nbe pleasant, but a hard thing in married life to enjoy. The young lady\r\nwho supposes that any young man wishes to marry her for the sake of\r\nnursing her through life makes a very grave mistake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES DEMAND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION.\r\nWHY NOT MATRIMONY?]\r\n\r\n5. WHOM TO CHOOSE FOR A HUSBAND.--The choice of a husband requires the\r\ncoolest judgment and the most vigilant sagacity. A true union based on\r\norganic law is happiness, but let all remember that oil and water\r\nwill not mix: the lion will not lie down with the lamb, nor can\r\nill-assorted marriages be productive of aught but discord.\r\n\r\n  \"Let the woman take\r\n  An elder than herself, so wears she to him--\r\n  So sways she, rules in her husband's heart.\"\r\n\r\nLook carefully at the disposition.--See that your intended Spouse is\r\nkind-hearted, generous, and willing to respect the opinions of others,\r\nthough not in sympathy with them. Don't marry a selfish tyrant who\r\nthinks only of himself.\r\n\r\n6. BE CAREFUL.--Don't marry an intemperate man with a view of\r\nreforming him. Thousands have tried it and failed. Misery, sorrow\r\nand a very hell on earth have been the consequences of too many such\r\ngenerous undertakings.\r\n\r\n7. THE TRUE AND ONLY TEST which any man should look for in woman is\r\nmodesty in demeanor before marriage, absence both of assumed ignorance\r\nand disagreeable familiarity, and a pure and religious frame of mind.\r\nWhere these are present, he need not doubt that he has a faithful and\r\na chaste wife.\r\n\r\n8. MARRYING FIRST COUSINS is dangerous to offspring. The observation\r\nis universal, the children of married first cousins are too often\r\nidiots, insane, clump-footed, crippled, blind, or variously diseased.\r\nFirst cousins are always sure to impart all the hereditary disease\r\nin both families to their children. If both are healthy there is less\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\n9. DO NOT CHOOSE ONE TOO GOOD, or too far above you, lest the inferior\r\ndissatisfying the superior, breed those discords which are worse than\r\nthe trials of a single life. Don't be too particular; for you might go\r\nfarther and fare worse. As far as you yourself are faulty, you should\r\nput up with faults. Don't cheat a consort by getting one much better\r\nthan you can give. We are not in heaven yet, and must put up with\r\ntheir imperfections, and instead of grumbling at them, be glad they\r\nare no worse; remembering that a faulty one is a great deal better\r\nthan none, if he loves you.\r\n\r\n10. MARRYING FOR MONEY.--Those who seek only the society of those who\r\ncan boast of wealth will nine times out of ten suffer disappointment.\r\nWealth cannot manufacture true love nor money buy domestic happiness.\r\nMarry because you love each other, and God will bless your home. A\r\ncottage with a loving wife is worth more than a royal palace with a\r\ndiscontented and unloving queen.\r\n\r\n11. DIFFERENCE IN AGE.--It is generally admitted that the husband\r\nshould be a few years older than the wife. The question seems to\r\nbe how much difference. Up to twenty-two those who propose marriage\r\nshould be about the same age; however, other things being equal, a\r\ndifference of fifteen years after the younger is twenty-five, need\r\nnot prevent a marriage. A man of forty-five may marry a woman of\r\ntwenty-five much more safely than one of thirty a girl below nineteen,\r\nbecause her mental sexuality is not as mature as his, and again her\r\nnatural coyness requires more delicate and affectionate treatment than\r\nhe is likely to bestow. A girl of twenty or under should seldom if\r\never marry a man of thirty or over, because the love of an elderly man\r\nfor a girl is more parental than conjugal; while hers for him is like\r\nthat of a daughter to a father. He may pet, flatter and indulge her\r\nas he would a grown-up daughter, yet all this is not genuine masculine\r\nand feminine love, nor can she exert over him the influence every man\r\nrequires from his wife.\r\n\r\n12. THE BEST TIME.--All things considered, we advise the male reader\r\nto keep his desires in check till he is at least twenty-five, and the\r\nfemale not to enter the pale of wedlock until she has attained the\r\nage of twenty. After those periods, marriage is the proper sphere of\r\naction, and one in which nearly every individual is called by nature\r\nto play his proper part.\r\n\r\n13. SELECT CAREFULLY.--While character, health, accomplishments and\r\nsocial position should be considered, yet one must not overlook mental\r\nconstruction and physical conformation. The rule always to be followed\r\nin choosing a life partner is _identity of taste and diversity of\r\ntemperament_. Another essential is that they be physically adapted\r\nto each other. For example: The pelvis--that part of the anatomy\r\ncontaining all the internal organs of gestation--is not only essential\r\nto beauty and symmetry, but is a matter of vital importance to her\r\nwho contemplates matrimony, and its usual consequences. Therefore, the\r\nwoman with a very narrow and contracted pelvis should never choose a\r\nman of giant physical development lest they cannot duly realize the\r\nmost important of the enjoyments of the marriage state, while the\r\nbirth of large infants will impose upon her intense labor pains, or\r\neven cost her her life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXPLAINING THE NEED OF A NEW HAT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHOOSE INTELLECTUALLY--LOVE AFTERWARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. LOVE.--Let it ever be remembered that love is one of the most\r\nsacred elements of our nature, and the most dangerous with which\r\nto tamper. It is a very beautiful and delicately contrived faculty,\r\nproducing the most delightful results, but easily thrown out of\r\nrepair--like a tender plant, the delicate fibers of which incline\r\ngradually to entwine themselves around its beloved one, uniting two\r\nwilling hearts by a thousand endearing ties, and making of \"twain one\r\nflesh\": but they are easily torn asunder, and then adieu to the joys\r\nof connubial bliss!\r\n\r\n2. COURTING BY THE QUARTER.--This courting by the quarter, \"here a\r\nlittle and there a little,\" is one of the greatest evils of the day.\r\nThis getting a little in love with Julia, and then a little with\r\nEliza, and a little more with Mary,--this fashionable flirtation\r\nand coquetry of both sexes--is ruinous to the domestic affections;\r\nbesides, effectually preventing the formation of true connubial love.\r\nI consider this dissipation of the affections one of the greatest\r\nsins against Heaven, ourselves, and the one trifled with, that can be\r\ncommitted.\r\n\r\n3. FRITTERING AWAY AFFECTIONS.--Young men commence courting long\r\nbefore they think of marrying, and where they entertain no thoughts of\r\nmarriage. They fritter away their own affections, and pride themselves\r\non their conquests over the female heart; triumphing in having so\r\nnicely fooled them. They pursue this sinful course so far as to drive\r\ntheir pitiable victims, one after another, from respectable society,\r\nwho, becoming disgraced, retaliate by heaping upon them all the\r\nindignities and impositions which the fertile imagination of woman can\r\ninvent or execute.\r\n\r\n4. COURTING WITHOUT INTENDING TO MARRY.--Nearly all this wide-spread\r\ncrime and suffering connected with public and private licentiousness\r\nand prostitution, has its origin in these unmeaning courtships--this\r\npremature love--this blighting of the affections, and every young\r\nman who courts without intending to marry, is throwing himself or his\r\nsweet-heart into _this hell upon earth._ And most of the blame rests\r\non young men, because they take the liberty of paying their addresses\r\nto the ladies and discontinuing them, at pleasure, and thereby mainly\r\ncause this vice.\r\n\r\n5. SETTING THEIR CAPS.--True, young ladies sometimes \"set their caps,\"\r\nsometimes court very hard by their bewitching smiles and affectionate\r\nmanners; by the natural language of love, or that backward reclining\r\nand affectionate roll of the head which expresses it; by their soft\r\nand persuasive accents; by their low dresses, artificial forms,\r\nand many other unnatural and affected ways and means of attracting\r\nattention and exciting love; but women never court till they have been\r\nin love and experienced its interruption, till their first and most\r\ntender fibres of love have been frost-bitten by disappointment. It is\r\nsurely a sad condition of society.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOTHERHOOD.]\r\n\r\n6. TRAMPLING THE AFFECTIONS OF WOMEN.--But man is a self-privileged\r\ncharacter. He may not only violate the laws of his own social nature\r\nwith impunity, but he may even trample upon the affections of woman.\r\nHe may even carry this sinful indulgence to almost any length, and yet\r\nbe caressed and smiled tenderly upon by woman; aye, even by virtuous\r\nwoman. He may call out, only to blast the glowing affections of one\r\nyoung lady after another, and yet his addresses be cordially welcomed\r\nby others. Surely a gentleman is at perfect liberty to pay his\r\naddresses, not only to a lady, but even to the ladies, although he\r\ndoes not once entertain the thought of marrying his sweet-heart, or,\r\nrather his victim. O, man, how depraved! O, woman, how strangely blind\r\nto your own rights and interests!\r\n\r\n7. AN INFALLIBLE SIGN.--An infallible sign that a young man's\r\nintentions are improper, is his trying to excite your passions. If he\r\nloves you, he will never appeal to that feeling, because he respects\r\nyou too much for that. And the woman who allows a man to take\r\nadvantage of her just to compel him to marry her, is lost and\r\nheartless in the last degree, and utterly destitute of moral principle\r\nas well as virtue. A woman's riches is her virtue, that gone she has\r\nlost all.\r\n\r\n8. THE BEGINNING OF LICENTIOUSNESS.--Man it seldom drives from\r\nsociety. Do what he may, woman, aye, virtuous and even pious woman\r\nrarely excludes him from her list of visitors. But where is the point\r\nof propriety?--immoral transgression should exclude either sex from\r\nrespectable society. Is it that one false step which now constitutes\r\nthe boundary between virtue and vice? Or rather, the discovery of that\r\nfalse step? Certainly not! but it is all that leads to, and precedes\r\nand induces it. It is this courting without marrying. This is the\r\nbeginning of licentiousness, as well as its main, procuring cause, and\r\ntherefore infinitely worse than its consummation merely.\r\n\r\n9. SEARING THE SOCIAL AFFECTIONS.--He has seared his social affections\r\nso deeply, so thoroughly, so effectually, that when, at last, he\r\nwishes to marry, he is incapable of loving. He marries, but is\r\nnecessarily cold-hearted towards his wife, which of course renders her\r\nwretched, if not jealous, and reverses the faculties of both towards\r\neach other; making both most miserable for life. This induces\r\ncontention and mutual recrimination, if not unfaithfulness, and\r\nimbitters the marriage relations through life; and well it may.\r\n\r\n10. UNHAPPY MARRIAGES.--This very cause, besides inducing most of that\r\nunblushing public and private prostitution already alluded to, renders\r\na large proportion of the marriages of the present day unhappy. Good\r\npeople mourn over the result, but do not once dream of its cause. They\r\neven pray for moral reform, yet do the very things that increase the\r\nevil.\r\n\r\n11. WEEPING OVER HER FALLEN SON.--Do you see yonder godly mother,\r\nweeping over her fallen son, and remonstrating with him in tones of a\r\nmother's tenderness and importunity? That very mother prevented that\r\nvery son marrying the girl he dearly loved, because she was poor, and\r\nthis interruption of his love was the direct and procuring cause of\r\nhis ruin; for, if she had allowed him to marry this beloved one, he\r\nnever would have thought of giving his \"strength unto strange\r\nwomen.\" True, the mother ruined her son ignorantly, but none the less\r\neffectually.\r\n\r\n12. SEDUCTION AND RUIN.--That son next courts another virtuous\r\nfair one, engages her affections, and ruins her, or else leaves her\r\nbroken-hearted, so that she is the more easily ruined by others, and\r\nthus prepares the way for her becoming an inmate of a house \"whose\r\nsteps take hold on hell.\" His heart is now indifferent, he is ready\r\nfor anything.\r\n\r\n13. THE RIGHT PRINCIPLE.--I say then, with emphasis, that no man\r\nshould ever pay his addresses to any woman, until he has made his\r\nselection, not even to aid him in making that choice. He should first\r\nmake his selection intellectually, and love afterward. He should go\r\nabout the matter coolly and with judgment, just as he would undertake\r\nany other important matter. No man or woman, when blinded by love, is\r\nin a fit state to judge advantageously as to what he or she requires,\r\nor who is adapted to his or her wants.\r\n\r\n14. CHOOSING FIRST AND LOVING AFTERWARDS.--I know, indeed, that this\r\ndoctrine of choosing first and loving afterward, of excluding love\r\nfrom the councils, and of choosing by and with the consent of the\r\nintellect and moral sentiments, is entirely at variance with the\r\nfeelings of the young and the customs of society; but, for its\r\ncorrectness, I appeal to the common-sense--not to the experience, for\r\nso few try this plan. Is not this the only proper method, and the one\r\nmost likely to result happily? Try it.\r\n\r\n15. THE YOUNG WOMAN'S CAUTION.--And, especially, let no young lady\r\never once think of bestowing her affections till she is certain they\r\nwill not be broken off--that is, until the match is fully agreed upon,\r\nbut rather let her keep her heart whole till she bestows it for life.\r\nThis requisition is as much more important, and its violation as much\r\nmore disastrous to woman than to man, as her social faculties are\r\nstronger than his.\r\n\r\n16. A BURNT CHILD DREADS THE FIRE.--As a \"burnt child dreads the\r\nfire,\" and the more it is burnt, the greater the dread: so your\r\naffections, once interrupted, will recoil from a second love, and\r\ndistrust all mankind. No! you cannot be too choice of your love--that\r\npivot on which turn your destinies for life and future happiness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AFTER THE ENGAGEMENT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLOVE-SPATS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Could ever hear by tale or history,\r\n  The course of true love never did run smooth.\r\n  --SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\n  \"Heaven has no rage like love to hatred turned,\r\n  Nor hell a fury like a woman scorned.\"--CONGREVE.\r\n\r\n\"Thunderstorms clear the atmosphere and promote vegetation; then why\r\nnot Love-spats promote love, as they certainly often do?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are almost universal, and in the nature of our differences\r\ncannot be helped. The more two love, the more they are aggrieved by\r\neach other's faults; of which these spats are but the correction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Love-spats instead of being universal, they are consequent on\r\nimperfect love, and only aggravate, never correct errors. Sexual\r\nstorms never improve, whereas love obviates faults by praising the\r\nopposite virtues. Every view of them, practical and philosophical,\r\ncondemns them as being to love what poison is to health, both before\r\nand after marriage. They are nothing but married discords. Every law\r\nof mind and love condemns them. Shun them as you would deadly vipers,\r\nand prevent them by forestallment.\"--O.S. Fowler.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE TRUE FACTS.--Notwithstanding some of the above quotations, to\r\nthe contrary, trouble and disagreement between lovers embitters\r\nboth love and life. Contention is always dangerous, and will beget\r\nalienation if not final separation.\r\n\r\n2. CONFIRMED AFFECTIONS.--Where affections are once thoroughly\r\nconfirmed, each one should be very careful in taking offense, and\r\navoid all disagreements as far as possible, but if disagreements\r\ncontinually develop with more or less friction and irritation, it is\r\nbetter for the crisis to come and a final separation take place. For\r\npeace is better than disunited love.\r\n\r\n3. HATE-SPATS.--Hate-spats, though experienced by most lovers, yet,\r\nfew realize how fatal they are to subsequent affections. Love-spats\r\ndevelop into hate-spats, and their effects upon the affections are\r\nblighting and should not under any circumstances be tolerated. Either\r\nagree, or agree to disagree. If there cannot be harmony before the\r\nties of marriage are assumed, then there cannot be harmony after.\r\nMarried life will be continually marred by a series of \"hate-spats\"\r\nthat sooner or later will destroy all happiness, unless the couple are\r\nreasonably well mated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOME LOVING HEARTS ARE HAPPIEST.]\r\n\r\n4. MORE FATAL THE OFTENER THEY OCCUR.--As O.S. Fowler says: \"'The\r\npoison of asps is under their lips.' The first spat is like a deep\r\ngash cut into a beautiful face, rendering it ghastly, and leaving\r\na fearful scar, which neither time nor cosmetics can ever efface;\r\nincluding that pain so fatal to love, and blotting that sacred\r\nlove-page with memory's most hideous and imperishable visages. Cannot\r\nmany now unhappy remember them as the beginning of that alienation\r\nwhich embittered your subsequent affectional cup, spoiled your lives?\r\nWith what inherent repulsion do you look back upon them? Their memory\r\nis horrid, and effect on love most destructive.\"\r\n\r\n5. FATAL CONDITIONS.--What are all lovers' \"spats\" but disappointment\r\nin its very worst form? They necessarily and always produce all its\r\nterrible consequences. The finer feelings and sensibilities will soon\r\nbecome destroyed and nothing but hatred will remain.\r\n\r\n6. EXTREME SORROW.--After a serious \"spat\" there generally follows a\r\nperiod of tender sorrow, and a feeling of humiliation and submission.\r\nMutual promises are consequently made that such a condition of things\r\nshall never happen again, etc. But be sure and remember, that every\r\nsubsequent difficulty will require stronger efforts to repair the\r\nbreach. Let it be understood that these compromises are dangerous, and\r\nevery new difficulty increases their fatality. Even the strongest will\r\nendure but few, nor survive many.\r\n\r\n7. DISTRUST AND WANT OF CONFIDENCE.--Most difficulties arise from\r\ndistrust or lack of confidence or common-sense. When two lovers eye\r\neach other like two curs, each watching, lest the other should gain\r\nsome new advantage, then this shows a lack of common-sense, and the\r\nyoung couple should get sensible or separate.\r\n\r\n8. JEALOUSY.--When one of the lovers, once so tender, now all at\r\nonce so cold and hardened; once so coy and familiar now suddenly\r\nso reserved, distant, hard and austere, is always a sure case of\r\njealousy. A jealous person is first talkative, very affectionate, and\r\nthen all at once changes and becomes cold, reserved and repulsive,\r\napparently without cause. If a person is jealous before marriage, this\r\ncharacteristic will be increased rather than diminished by marriage.\r\n\r\n9. CONFESSION.--If you make up by confession, the confessor feels\r\nmean and disgraced; or if both confess and forgive, both feel humbled;\r\nsince forgiveness implies inferiority and pity; from which whatever\r\nis manly and womanly shrinks. Still even this is better than continued\r\n\"spats.\"\r\n\r\n10. PREVENTION.--If you can get along well in your courtship you will\r\ninvariably make a happy couple if you should unite your destinies in\r\nmarriage. Learn not to give nor take offence. You must remember that\r\nall humanity is imperfect at best. We all have our faults, and must\r\nkeep them in subordination. Those who truly love each other will have\r\nbut few difficulties in their courtship or in married life.\r\n\r\n11. REMEDIES.--Establishing a perfect love in the beginning\r\nconstitutes a preventive. Fear that they are not truly loved usually\r\npaves the way for \"spats.\" Let all who make any pretension guard\r\nagainst all beginnings of this reversal, and strangle these\r\n\"hate-spats\" the moment they arise. \"Let not the sun go down upon thy\r\nwrath,\" not even an hour, but let the next sentence after they begin\r\nquench them forever. And let those who cannot court without \"spats,\"\r\nstop; for those who spat before marriage must quarrel after.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"LET NOT THE SUN GO DOWN UPON THY WRATH\".]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALONE AND FORSAKEN.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA BROKEN HEART.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. WOUNDED LOVE.--'Tis true that love wields a magic, sovereign,\r\nabsolute, and tyrannical power over both the body and the mind when it\r\nis given control. It often, in case of dissapointment, works havoc\r\nand deals death blows to its victims, and leaves many in that morbid\r\nmental condition which no life-tonics simply can restore. Wounded love\r\nmay be the result of hasty and indiscreet conduct of young people;\r\nor the outgrowth of lust, or the result of domestic infidelity and\r\ndiscord.\r\n\r\n2. FATAL EFFECTS.--Our cemeteries receive within the cold shadows of\r\nthe grave thousands and thousands of victims that annually die from\r\nthe results of \"broken hearts.\" It is no doubt a fact that love\r\ntroubles cause more disorders of the heart than everything else\r\ncombined.\r\n\r\n3. DISRUPTED LOVE.--It has long been known that dogs, birds, and even\r\nhorses, when separated from their companions or friends, have pined\r\naway and died; so it is not strange that man with his higher intuitive\r\nideas of affection should suffer from love when suddenly disrupted.\r\n\r\n4. CRUCIFYING LOVE.--Painful love feelings strike right to the heart,\r\nand the breaking up of love that cannot be consummated in marriage is\r\nsometimes allowed to crucify the affections. There is no doubt that\r\nthe suffering from disappointed love is often deeper and more intense\r\nthan meeting death itself.\r\n\r\n5. HEALING.--The paralyzing and agonizing consequences of ruptured love\r\ncan only be remedied by diversion and society. Bring the mind into a\r\nstate of patriotic independence with a full determination to blot\r\nout the past. Those who cannot bring into subordination the pangs of\r\ndisappointment in love are not strong characters, and invariably\r\nwill suffer disappointments in almost every department of life.\r\nDisappointment in love means rising above it, and conquering it, or\r\ndemoralization, mental, physical and sexual.\r\n\r\n6. LOVE RUNS MAD.--Love comes unbidden. A blind ungovernable impulse\r\nseems to hold sway in the passions of the affections. Love is blind\r\nand seems to completely subdue and conquer. It often comes like a clap\r\nof thunder from a clear sky, and when it falls it falls flat, leaving\r\nonly the ruins of a tornado behind.\r\n\r\n7. BAD, DISMAL, AND BLUE FEELINGS.--Despondency breathes disease,\r\nand those who yield to it can neither work, eat nor sleep; they only\r\nsuffer. The spell-bound, fascinated, magnetized affections seem to\r\ndeaden self-control and no doubt many suffering from love-sickness are\r\ntotally helpless; they are beside themselves, irritational and wild.\r\nMen and women of genius, influence and education, all seem to suffer\r\nalike, but they do not yield alike to the subduing influence; some\r\npine away and die; others rise above it, and are the stronger and\r\nbetter for having been afflicted.\r\n\r\n8. RISE ABOVE IT.--Cheer up! If you cannot think pleasurably over\r\nyour misfortune, forget it. You must do this or perish. Your power\r\nand influence is too much to blight by foolish and melancholic pining.\r\nYour own sense, your self-respect, your self-love, your love for\r\nothers, command you not to spoil yourself by crying over \"spilt milk.\"\r\n\r\n9. RETRIEVE YOUR PAST LOSS.--Do sun, moon, and stars indeed rise and\r\nset in your loved one? Are there not \"as good fish in the sea as ever\r\nwere caught?\" and can you not catch them? Are there not other hearts\r\non earth just as loving and lovely, and in every way as congenial; If\r\ncircumstances had first turned you upon another, you would have felt\r\nabout that one as now about this. Love depends far less on the party\r\nloved than on the loving one. Or is this the way either to retrieve\r\nyour past loss, or provide for the future? Is it not both unwise and\r\nself-destructive; and in every way calculated to render your case,\r\npresent and prospective, still more hopeless?\r\n\r\n10. FIND SOMETHING TO DO.--Idle hands are Satan's workshop. Employ\r\nyour mind; find something to do; something in which you can find\r\nself-improvement; something that will fit you better to be admired\r\nby someone else, read, and improve your mind; get into society, throw\r\nyour whole soul into some new enterprise, and you will conquer with\r\nglory and come out of the fire purified and made more worthy.\r\n\r\n11. LOVE AGAIN.--As love was the cause of your suffering, so love again\r\nwill restore you, and you will love better and more consistently. Do\r\nnot allow yourself to become soured and detest and shun association.\r\nRebuild your dilapidated sexuality by cultivating a general\r\nappreciation of the excellence, especially of the mental and moral\r\nqualities of the opposite sex. Conquer your prejudices, and vow not to\r\nallow anyone to annoy or disturb your calmness.\r\n\r\n12. LOVE FOR THE DEAD.--A most affectionate woman, who continues to\r\nlove her affianced though long dead, instead of becoming soured\r\nor deadened, manifests all the richness and sweetness of the\r\nfully-developed woman thoroughly in love, along with a softened,\r\nmellow, twilight sadness which touches every heart, yet throws a\r\npeculiar lustre and beauty over her manners and entire character. She\r\nmust mourn, but not forever. It is not her duty to herself or to her\r\nCreator.\r\n\r\n13. A SURE REMEDY.--Come in contact with the other sex. You are\r\ninfused with your lover's magnetism, which must remain till displaced\r\nby another's. Go to parties and picnics; be free, familiar, offhand,\r\neven forward; try your knack at fascinating another, and yield to\r\nfascinations yourself. But be honest, command respect, and make\r\nyourself attractive and worthy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SURE REMEDY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFORMER CUSTOMS AND PECULIARITIES AMONG MEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. POLYGAMY.--There is a wide difference as regards the relations of\r\nthe sexes in different parts of the world. In some parts polygamy has\r\nprevailed from time immemorial.\r\n\r\nMost savage people are polygamists, and the Turks, though slowly\r\ndeparting from the practice, still allow themselves a plurality of\r\nwives.\r\n\r\n2. RULE REVERSED.--In Thibet the rule is reversed, and the females are\r\nprovided with two or more husbands. It is said that in many instances\r\na whole family of brothers have but one wife. The custom has at\r\nleast one advantageous feature, viz.: the possibility of leaving an\r\nunprotected widow and a number of fatherless children is entirely\r\nobviated.\r\n\r\n3. THE MORGANATIC MARRIAGE is a modification of polygamy. It sometimes\r\noccurs among the royalty of Europe, and is regarded as perfectly\r\nlegitimate, but the morganatic wife is of lower rank than her royal\r\nhusband, and her children do not inherit his rank or fortune. The\r\nQueen only is the consort of the sovereign, and entitled to share his\r\nrank.\r\n\r\n4. DIFFERENT MANNERS OF OBTAINING WIVES.--Among the uncivilized almost\r\nany envied possession is taken by brute force or superior strength.\r\nThe same is true in obtaining a wife. The strong take precedence of\r\nthe weak. It is said that among the North American Indians it was the\r\ncustom for men to wrestle for the choice of women. A weak man could\r\nseldom retain a wife that a strong man coveted.\r\n\r\nThe law of contest was not confined to individuals alone. Women were\r\nfrequently the cause of whole tribes arraying themselves against each\r\nother in battle. The effort to excel in physical power was a great\r\nincentive to bodily development, and since the best of the men were\r\npreferred by the most superior women, the custom was a good one in\r\nthis, that the race was improved.\r\n\r\n5. THE ABORIGINAL AUSTRALIAN employed low cunning and heartless\r\ncruelty in obtaining his wife. Laying in ambush, with club in hand, he\r\nwould watch for the coveted woman, and, unawares, spring upon her. If\r\nsimply disabled he carried her off as his possession, but if the blow\r\nhad been hard enough to kill, he abandoned her to watch for another\r\nvictim. There is here no effort to attract or please, no contest of\r\nstrength; his courtship, if courtship it can be called, would compare\r\nvery unfavorably with any among the brute creation.\r\n\r\n6. THE KALMUCK TARTAR races for his bride on horseback, she having\r\na certain start previously agreed upon. The nuptial knot consists in\r\ncatching her, but we are told that the result of the race all depends\r\nupon whether the girl wants to be caught or not.\r\n\r\n7. HAWAIIAN ISLANDERS.--Marriage among the early natives of these\r\nislands was merely a matter of mutual inclination. There was no\r\nceremony at all, the men and women united and separated as they felt\r\ndisposed.\r\n\r\n8. THE FEUDAL LORD, in various parts of Europe, when any of his\r\ndependents or followers married, exercised the right of assuming the\r\nbridegroom's proper place in the marriage couch for the first night.\r\nSeldom was there any escape from this abominable practice. Sometimes\r\nthe husband, if wealthy, succeeded in buying off the petty sovereign\r\nfrom exercising his privilege.\r\n\r\n9. THE SPARTANS had the custom of encouraging intercourse between\r\ntheir best men and women for the sake of a superior progeny, without\r\nany reference to a marriage ceremony. Records show that the ancient\r\nRoman husband has been known to invite a friend, in whom he may have\r\nadmired some physical or mental trait, to share the favors of his\r\nwife; that the peculiar qualities that he admired might be repeated in\r\nthe offspring.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROPOSING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHasty marriage seldom proveth well.--_Shakespeare, Henry VI._\r\n\r\nThe reason why so few marriages are happy is, because young ladies\r\nspend their time in making nets, not in making cages.--_Swift,\r\nThoughts on Various Subjects._\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSENSIBLE HINTS IN CHOOSING A PARTNER.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. There are many fatal errors and many love-making failures in\r\ncourtship. Natural laws govern all nature and reduce all they govern\r\nto eternal right; therefore love naturally, not artificially. Don't\r\nlove a somebody or a nobody simply because they have money.\r\n\r\n2. COURT SCIENTIFICALLY.--If you court at all, court scientifically.\r\nBungle whatever else you will, but do no bungle courtship. A failure\r\nin this may mean more than a loss of wealth or public honors; it may\r\nmean ruin, or a life often worse than death. The world is full of\r\nwretched and mismated people.\r\n\r\nBEGIN RIGHT and all will be right; begin wrong and all will end wrong.\r\nWhen you court, make a business of it and study your interest the same\r\nas you would study any other business proposition.\r\n\r\n3. DIVORCES.--There is not a divorce on our court records that is not\r\nthe result of some fundamental error in courtship. The purity or the\r\npower of love may be corrupted the same as any other faculty, and when\r\na man makes up his mind to marry and shuts his eyes and grabs in the\r\ndark for a companion, he dishonors the woman he captures and commits a\r\ncrime against God and society. In this enlightened age there should\r\nbe comparatively few mistakes made in the selection of a suitable\r\npartner. Sufficient time should be taken to study each other's\r\ncharacter and disposition. Association will soon reveal adaptability.\r\n\r\n4. FALSE LOVE.--Many a poor, blind and infatuated novice thinks he is\r\ndesperately in love, when there is not the least genuine affection in\r\nhis nature. It is all a momentary passion a sort of puppy love; his\r\nvows and pledges are soon violated, and in wedlock he will become\r\nindifferent and cold to his wife and children, and he will go through\r\nlife without ambition, encouragement or success. He will be a failure.\r\nTrue love speaks for itself, and the casual observer can read its\r\nproclamations. True love does not speak in a whisper, it always makes\r\nitself heard. The follies of flirting develops into many unhappy\r\nmarriages, and blight many a life. Man happily married has superior\r\nadvantages both social and financially.\r\n\r\n5. FLIRTING JUST FOR FUN.--Who is the flirt, what is his reputation,\r\nmotive, or character? Every young man and woman must have a\r\nreputation; if it is not good it is bad, there is no middle ground.\r\nYoung people who are running in the streets after dark, boisterous\r\nand noisy in their conversation, gossiping and giggling, flirting\r\nwith first one and then another, will soon settle their matrimonial\r\nprospects among good society. Modesty is a priceless jewel. No\r\nsensible young man with a future will marry a flirt.\r\n\r\n6. THE ARCH-DECEIVER.--They who win the affection simply for their own\r\namusement are committing a great sin for which there is no adequate\r\npunishment. How can you shipwreck the innocent life of that confiding\r\nmaiden, how can you forget her happy looks as she drank in your\r\nexpressions of love, how can you forget her melting eyes and glowing\r\ncheeks, her tender tone reciprocating your pretended love? Remember\r\nthat God is infinitely just, and \"the soul that sinneth shall surely\r\ndie.\" You may dash into business, seek pleasure in the club room, and\r\nvisit gambling hells, but \"Thou art the man\" will ever stare you in\r\nthe face. Her pale, sad cheeks, her hollow eyes will never cease to\r\nhaunt you. Men should promote happiness, and not cause misery. Let the\r\nsavage Indians torture captives to death by the slow flaming fagot,\r\nbut let civilized man respect the tenderness and love of confiding\r\nwomen. Torturing the opposite sex is double-distilled barbarity. Young\r\nmen agonizing young ladies, is the cold-blooded cruelty of devils, not\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n7. THE RULE TO FOLLOW.--Do not continually pay your attentions to the\r\nsame lady if you have no desire to win her affections. Occasionally\r\nescorting her to church, concert, picnic, party, etc., is perfectly\r\nproper; but to give her your special attention, and extend invitations\r\nto her for all places of amusements where you care to attend, is an\r\nimplied promise that you prefer her company above all others, and she\r\nhas a right to believe that your attentions are serious.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WEDDING RING.]\r\n\r\n8. EVERY GIRL SHOULD SEAL HER HEART against all manifested affections,\r\nunless they are accompanied by a proposal. Woman's love is her all,\r\nand her heart should be as flint until she finds one who is worthy\r\nof her confidence. Young woman, never bestow your affections until\r\nby some word or deed at least you are fully justified in recognizing\r\nsincerity and faith in him who is paying you special attention. Better\r\nnot be engaged until twenty-two. You are then more competent to judge\r\nthe honesty and falsity of man. Nature has thrown a wall of maidenly\r\nmodesty around you. Preserve that and not let your affections be\r\ntrifled with while too young by any youthful flirt who is in search of\r\nhearts to conquer.\r\n\r\n9. FEMALE FLIRTATION.--The young man who loves a young woman has paid\r\nher the highest compliment in the possession of man. Perpetrate\r\nalmost any sin, inflict any other torture, but spare him the agony of\r\ndisappointment. It is a crime that can never be forgiven, and a debt\r\nthat never can be paid.\r\n\r\n10. LOYALTY.--Young persons with serious intentions, or those who are\r\nengaged should be thoroughly loyal to each other. If they seek freedom\r\nwith others the flame of jealousy is likely to be kindled and love is\r\noften turned to hatred, and the severest anger of the soul is\r\naroused. Loyalty, faithfulness, confidence, are the three jewels to be\r\ncherished in courtship. Don't be a flirt.\r\n\r\n11. KISSING, FONDLING, AND CARESSING BETWEEN LOVERS.--This should\r\nnever be tolerated under any circumstances, unless there is an\r\nengagement to justify it, and then only in a sensible and limited\r\nway. The girl who allows a young man the privilege of kissing her or\r\nputting his arms around her waist before engagement will at once fall\r\nin the estimation of the man she has thus gratified and desired to\r\nplease. Privileges always injure, but never benefit.\r\n\r\n12. IMPROPER LIBERTIES DURING COURTSHIP KILL LOVE.--Any improper\r\nliberties which are permitted by young ladies, whether engaged or\r\nnot, will change love into sensuality, and her affections will become\r\nobnoxious, if not repellent. Men by nature love virtue, and for a life\r\ncompanion naturally shun an amorous woman. Young folks, as you\r\nlove moral purity and virtue, never reciprocate love until you\r\nhave required the right of betrothal. Remember that those who are\r\nthoroughly in love will respect the honor and virtue of each other.\r\nThe purity of woman is doubly attractive, and sensuality in her\r\nbecomes doubly offensive and repellent. It is contrary to the laws of\r\nnature for a man to love a harlot.\r\n\r\n13. A SEDUCER.--The punishment of the seducer is best given by O.S.\r\nFowler, in his \"Creative Science.\" The sin and punishment rest on all\r\nyou who call out only to blight a trusting, innocent, loving virgin's\r\naffections, and then discard her. You deserve to be horsewhipped by\r\nher father, cowhided by her brothers, branded villain by her mother,\r\ncursed by herself, and sent to the whipping-post and dungeon.\r\n\r\n14. CAUTION.--A young lady should never encourage the attentions of\r\na young man, who shows no interest in his sisters. If a young man is\r\nindifferent to his sisters he will become indifferent to his wife as\r\nsoon as the honey moon is over. There are few if any exceptions to\r\nthis rule. The brother who will not be kind and loving in his mother's\r\nhome will make a very poor husband.\r\n\r\n15. THE OLD RULE: \"Never marry a man that does not make his mother\r\na Christmas present every Christmas,\" is a good one. The young lady\r\nmakes no mistake in uniting her destinies with the man that loves his\r\nmother and respects his sisters and brothers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CHINESE BRIDE AND GROOM.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSAFE HINTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Marry in your own position in life. If there is any difference in\r\nsocial position, it is better that the husband should be the superior.\r\nA woman does not like to look down upon her husband, and to be obliged\r\nto do so is a poor guarantee for their happiness.\r\n\r\n2. It is best to marry persons of your own faith and religious\r\nconvictions, unless one is willing to adopt those of the other.\r\nDifference of faith is apt to divide families, and to produce great\r\ntrouble in after life. A pious woman should beware of marrying an\r\nirreligious man.\r\n\r\n3. Don't be afraid of marrying a poor man or woman. Good health,\r\ncheerful disposition, stout hearts and industrious hands will bring\r\nhappiness and comfort.\r\n\r\n4. Bright red hair should marry jet black, and jet black auburn or\r\nbright red, etc. And the more red-faced and bearded or impulsive a\r\nman, the more dark, calm, cool and quiet should his wife be; and vice\r\nversa. The florid should not marry the florid, but those who are dark,\r\nin proportion as they themselves are light.\r\n\r\n5. Red-whiskered men should marry brunettes, but no blondes; the color\r\nof the whiskers being more determinate of the temperament than that of\r\nthe hair.\r\n\r\n6. The color of the eyes is still more important. Gray eyes must marry\r\nsome other color, almost any other except gray; and so of blue, dark,\r\nhazel, etc.\r\n\r\n7. Those very fleshy should not marry those equally so, but those too\r\nspare and slim; and this is doubly true of females. A spare man is\r\nmuch better adapted to a fleshy woman than a round-favored man. Two\r\nwho are short, thick-set and stocky, should not unite in marriage, but\r\nshould choose those differently constituted; but on no account one of\r\ntheir own make. And, in general, those predisposed to corpulence are\r\ntherefore less inclined to marriage.\r\n\r\n8. Those with little hair or beard should marry those whose hair is\r\nnaturally abundant; still those who once had plenty, but who have lost\r\nit, may marry those who are either bald or have but little; for in\r\nthis, as in all other cases, all depends on what one is by nature,\r\nlittle on present states.\r\n\r\n9. Those whose motive-temperament decidedly predominates, who are\r\nbony, only moderately fleshy, quite prominent-featured, Roman-nosed\r\nand muscular, should not marry those similarly formed.\r\n\r\n10. Small, nervous men must not marry little, nervous or sanguine\r\nwomen, lest both they and their children have quite too much of the\r\nhot-headed and impulsive, and die suddenly.\r\n\r\n11. Two very beautiful persons rarely do or should marry; nor two\r\nextra homely. The fact is a little singular that very handsome women,\r\nwho of course can have their pick, rarely marry good-looking men,\r\nbut generally give preference to those who are homely; because that\r\nexquisiteness in which beauty originates naturally blends with that\r\npower which accompanies huge noses and disproportionate features.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIGHT. LIFE. HEALTH AND BEAUTY.]\r\n\r\n12. Rapid movers, speakers, laughers, etc., should marry those who are\r\ncalm and deliberate, and impulsives those who are stoical; while those\r\nwho are medium may marry those who are either or neither, as they\r\nprefer.\r\n\r\n13. Noses indicate characters by indicating the organisms and\r\ntemperaments. Accordingly, those noses especially marked either way\r\nshould marry those having opposite nasal characteristics. Roman noses\r\nare adapted to those which turn up, and pug noses to those turning\r\ndown; while straight noses may marry either.\r\n\r\n14. Men who love to command must be especially careful not to marry\r\nimperious, women's-rights woman; while those who willingly \"obey\r\norders\" need just such. Some men require a wife who shall take their\r\npart; yet all who do not need strong-willed women, should be careful\r\nhow they marry them.\r\n\r\n15. A sensible woman should not marry an obstinate but injudicious,\r\nunintelligent man; because she cannot long endure to see and help him\r\nblindly follow his poor, but spurn her good, plans.\r\n\r\n16. The reserved or secretive should marry the frank. A cunning\r\nman cannot endure the least artifice in a wife. Those who are\r\nnon-committal must marry those who are demonstrative; else, however\r\nmuch they may love, neither will feel sure as to the other's\r\naffections, and each will distrust the other, while their children\r\nwill be deceitful.\r\n\r\n17. A timid woman should never marry a hesitating man, lest, like\r\nfrightened children, each keep perpetually re-alarming the other by\r\nimaginary fears.\r\n\r\n18. An industrious, thrifty, hard-working man should marry a woman\r\ntolerably saving and industrious. As the \"almighty dollar\" is now the\r\ngreat motor-wheel of humanity, and that to which most husbands devote\r\ntheir entire lives to delve alone is uphill work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRESIDE FANCIES.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMARRIAGE SECURITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. SEEK EACH OTHER'S HAPPINESS.--A selfish marriage that seeks only\r\nits own happiness defeats itself. Happiness is a fire that will not\r\nburn long on one stick.\r\n\r\n2. DO NOT MARRY SUDDENLY.--It can always be done till it is done, if\r\nit is a proper thing to do.\r\n\r\n3. MARRY IN YOUR OWN GRADE IN SOCIETY.--It is painful to be always\r\napologizing for any one. It is more painful to be apologized for.\r\n\r\n4. DO NOT MARRY DOWNWARD.--It is hard enough to advance in the quality\r\nof life without being loaded with clay heavier than your own. It will\r\nbe sufficiently difficult to keep your children up to your best level\r\nwithout having to correct a bias in their blood.\r\n\r\n5. DO NOT SELL YOURSELF.--It matters not whether the price be money or\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n6. DO NOT THROW YOURSELF AWAY.--You will not receive too much, even if\r\nyou are paid full price.\r\n\r\n7. SEEK THE ADVICE OF YOUR PARENTS.--Your parents are your best\r\nfriends. They will make more sacrifice for you than any other mortals.\r\nThey are elevated above selfishness concerning you. If they differ\r\nfrom you concerning your choice, it is because they must.\r\n\r\n8. DO NOT MARRY TO PLEASE ANY THIRD PARTY.--You must do the living and\r\nenduring.\r\n\r\n9. DO NOT MARRY TO SPITE ANYBODY.--It would add wretchedness to folly.\r\n\r\n10. DO NOT MARRY BECAUSE SOMEONE ELSE MAY SEEK THE SAME HAND.--One\r\nglove may not fit all hands equally well.\r\n\r\n11. DO NOT MARRY TO GET RID OF ANYBODY.--The coward who shot himself\r\nto escape from being drafted was insane.\r\n\r\n12. DO NOT MARRY MERELY FOR THE IMPULSE OF LOVE.--Love is a principle\r\nas well as an emotion. So far as it is a sentiment it is a blind\r\nguide. It does not wait to test the presence of exalted character in\r\nits object before breaking out into a flame. Shavings make a hot fire,\r\nbut hard coal is better for the Winter.\r\n\r\n13. DO NOT MARRY WITHOUT LOVE.--A body without a soul soon becomes\r\noffensive.\r\n\r\n14. TEST CAREFULLY THE EFFECT OF PROTRACTED ASSOCIATION.--If\r\nfamiliarity breeds contempt before marriage it will afterward.\r\n\r\n15. TEST CAREFULLY THE EFFECT OF PROTRACTED SEPARATION.--True love\r\nwill defy both time and space.\r\n\r\n16. CONSIDER CAREFULLY the right of your children under the laws of\r\nheredity. It is doubtful whether you have a right to increase the\r\nnumber of invalids and cripples.\r\n\r\n17. DO NOT MARRY SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU HAVE PROMISED TO DO SO.--If a seam\r\nopens between you now it will widen into a gulf. It is less offensive\r\nto retract a mistaken promise than to perjure your soul before the\r\naltar. Your intended spouse has a right to absolute integrity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOING TO BE MARRIED.]\r\n\r\n18. MARRY CHARACTER.--It is not so much what one has as what one is.\r\n\r\n19. DO NOT MARRY THE WRONG OBJECT.--Themistocles said he would rather\r\nmarry his daughter to a man without money than to money with a man. It\r\nis well to have both. It is fatal to have neither.\r\n\r\n20. DEMAND A JUST RETURN.--You give virtue and purity, and gentleness\r\nand integrity. You have a right to demand the same in return. Duty\r\nrequires it.\r\n\r\n21. REQUIRE BRAINS.--Culture is good, but will not be transmitted.\r\nBrain power may be.\r\n\r\n22. STUDY PAST RELATIONSHIP.--The good daughter and sister makes a\r\ngood wife. The good son and brother makes a good husband.\r\n\r\n23. NEVER MARRY AS A MISSIONARY DEED.--If one needs saving from bad\r\nhabits he is not suitable for you.\r\n\r\n24. MARRIAGE IS A SURE AND SPECIFIC REMEDY for all the ills known\r\nas seminal losses. As right eating cures a sick stomach and right\r\nbreathing diseased lungs, so the right use of the sexual organs will\r\nbring relief and restoration. Many men who have been sufferers\r\nfrom indiscretions of youth, have married, and were soon cured of\r\nspermatorrhoea and other complications which accompanied it.\r\n\r\n25. A GOOD, LONG COURTSHIP will often cure many difficulties or ills\r\nof the sexual organs. O.S. Fowler says: \"See each other often spend\r\nmany pleasant hours together,\" have many walks and talks, think of\r\neach other while absent, write many love letters, be inspired to many\r\nlove feelings and acts towards each other, and exercise your sexuality\r\nin a thousand forms ten thousand times, every one of which tones up\r\nand thereby recuperates this very element now dilapidated. When you\r\nhave courted long enough to marry, you will be sufficiently restored\r\nto be reimproved by it.\r\n\r\nUP AND AT IT.--Dress up, spruce up, and be on the alert. Don't wait\r\ntoo long to get one much more perfect than you are; but settle on some\r\none soon. Remember that your unsexed state renders you over-dainty,\r\nand easily disgusted. So contemplate only their lovable qualities.\r\n\r\n26. PURITY OF PURPOSE.--Court with a pure and loyal purpose, and when\r\nthoroughly convinced that the disposition of other difficulties are\r\nin the way of a happy marriage life, then _honorably_ discuss it and\r\nhonorably treat each other in the settlement.\r\n\r\n27. DO NOT TRIFLE with the feelings or affections of each other. It is\r\na sin that will curse you all the days of your life.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWOMEN WHO MAKE THE BEST WIVES.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. CONSCIOUS OF THE DUTIES OF HER SEX.--A woman conscious of the\r\nduties of her sex, one who unflinchingly discharges the duties\r\nallotted to her by nature, would no doubt make a good wife.\r\n\r\n2. GOOD WIVES AND MOTHERS.--The good wives and mothers are the women\r\nwho believe in the sisterhood of women as well as in the brotherhood\r\nof men. The highest exponent of this type seeks to make her home\r\nsomething more than an abode where children are fed, clothed and\r\ntaught the catechism. The State has taken her children into politics\r\nby making their education a function of politicians. The good wife\r\nand homemaker says to her children, \"Where thou goest, I will go.\" She\r\nputs off her own inclinations to ease and selfishness. She studies the\r\nmen who propose to educate her children; she exhorts mothers to sit\r\nbeside fathers on the school-board; she will even herself accept such\r\nthankless office in the interests of the helpless youth of the schools\r\nwho need a mother's as well as a father's and a teacher's care in this\r\nfield of politics.\r\n\r\n3. A BUSY WOMAN.--As to whether a busy woman, that is, a woman who\r\nlabors for mankind in the world outside her home,--whether such an one\r\ncan also be a good housekeeper, and care for her children, and make\r\na real \"Home, Sweet Home!\" with all the comforts by way of variation,\r\nwhy! I am ready, as the result of years practical experience as a\r\nbusy woman, to assert that women of affairs can also be women of true\r\ndomestic tastes and habits.\r\n\r\n4. BRAINY ENOUGH.--What kind of women make the best wives? The\r\nwoman who is brainy enough to be a companion, wise enough to be\r\na counsellor, skilled enough in the domestic virtues to be a good\r\nhousekeeper, and loving enough to guide in true paths the children\r\nwith whom the home may be blessed.\r\n\r\n5. FOUND THE RIGHT HUSBAND.--The best wife is the woman who has found\r\nthe right husband, a husband who understands her. A man will have the\r\nbest wife when he rates that wife as queen among women. Of all women\r\nshe should always be to him the dearest. This sort of man will not\r\nonly praise the dishes made by his wife, but will actually eat them.\r\n\r\n6. BANK ACCOUNT.--He will allow his life-companion a bank account,\r\nand will exact no itemized bill at the end of the month. Above all, he\r\nwill pay the Easter bonnet bill without a word, never bring a friend\r\nto dinner without first telephoning home,--short, he will comprehend\r\nthat the woman who makes the best wife is the woman whom, by his\r\nindulgence of her ways and whims, he makes the best wife. So after\r\nall, good husbands have the most to do with making good wives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PUNISHMENT OF WIFE BEATERS IN NEW ENGLAND IN THE EARLY\r\nDAYS.]\r\n\r\n7. BEST HOME MAKER.--A woman to be the best home maker needs to be\r\ndevoid of intensive \"nerves.\" She must be neat and systematic, but not\r\ntoo neat, lest she destroy the comfort she endeavors to create. She\r\nmust be distinctly amiable, while firm. She should have no \"career,\"\r\nor desire for a career, if she would fill to perfection the home\r\nsphere. She must be affectionate, sympathetic and patient, and fully\r\nappreciative of the worth and dignity of her sphere.\r\n\r\n8. KNOW NOTHING WHATSOEVER ABOUT COOKING OR SEWING OR HOUSEKEEPING.--I\r\nam inclined to make my answer to this question somewhat concise, after\r\nthe manner of a text without the sermon. Like this: To be the \"best\r\nwife\" depends upon three things: first, an abiding faith with God;\r\nsecond, duty lovingly discharged as daughter, wife and mother; third,\r\nself-improvement, mentally, physically, spiritually. With this as\r\na text and as a glittering generality, let me touch upon one or two\r\npractical essentials. In the course of every week it is my privilege\r\nto meet hundreds of young women,--prospective wives. I am astonished\r\nto find that many of these know nothing whatsoever about cooking or\r\nsewing or housekeeping. Now, if a woman cannot broil a beefsteak, nor\r\nboil the coffee when it is necessary, if she cannot mend the linen,\r\nnor patch a coat, if she cannot make a bed, order the dinner, create a\r\nlamp-shade, ventilate the house, nor do anything practical in the way\r\nof making home actually a home, how can she expect to make even a good\r\nwife, not to speak of a better or best wife? I need not continue this\r\nsermon. Wise girls will understand.\r\n\r\n9. THE BEST KEEPER OF HOME.--As to who is the best keeper of this\r\ntransition home, memory pictures to me a woman grown white under the\r\nold slavery, still bound by it, in that little-out-of-the-way Kansas\r\ntown, but never so bound that she could not put aside household tasks,\r\nat any time, for social intercourse, for religious conversation, for\r\ncorrespondence, for reading, and, above all, for making everyone who\r\ncame near her feel that her home was the expression of herself, a\r\nplace for rest, study, and the cultivation of affection. She did not\r\nexist for her walls, her carpets, her furniture; they existed for her\r\nand all who came to her She considered herself the equal of all; and\r\neveryone else thought her the superior of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nADAPTATION, CONJUGAL AFFECTION, AND FATAL ERRORS.\r\n\r\nADVICE TO THE MARRIED AND UNMARRIED.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. MARRYING FOR WEALTH.--Those who marry for wealth often get what\r\nthey marry and nothing else; for rich girls besides being generally\r\ndestitute of both industry and economy, are generally extravagant\r\nin their expenditures, and require servants enough to dissipate a\r\nfortune. They generally have insatiable wants, yet feel that they\r\ndeserve to be indulged in everything, because they placed their\r\nhusbands under obligation to them by bringing them a dowry. And then\r\nthe mere idea of living on the money of a wife, and of being supported\r\nby her, is enough to tantalize any man of an independent spirit.\r\n\r\n2. SELF-SUPPORT.--What spirited husband would not prefer to support\r\nboth himself and wife, rather than submit to this perpetual bondage\r\nof obligation. To live upon a father, or take a patrimony from him, is\r\nquite bad enough; but to run in debt to a wife, and owe her a living,\r\nis a little too aggravating for endurance, especially if there be not\r\nperfect cordiality between the two, which cannot be the case in money\r\nmatches. Better live wifeless, or anything else, rather than marry for\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n3. MONEY-SEEKERS.--Shame on sordid wife-seekers, or, rather,\r\nmoney-seekers; for it is not a wife that they seek, but only filthy\r\nlucre! They violate all their other faculties simply to gratify\r\nmiserly desire. Verily such \"have their reward\"!\r\n\r\n4. THE PENITENT HOUR.--And to you, young ladies, let me say with great\r\nemphasis, that those who court and marry you because you are rich,\r\nwill make you rue the day of your pecuniary espousals. They care not\r\nfor you, but only your money, and when they get that, will be liable\r\nto neglect or abuse you, and probably squander it, leaving you\r\ndestitute and abandoning you to your fate.\r\n\r\n6. INDUSTRY THE SIGN OF NOBILITY.--Marry a working, industrious young\r\nlady, whose constitution is strong, flesh solid, and health unimpaired\r\nby confinement, bad habits, or late hours. Give me a plain, home-spun\r\nfarmer's daughter, and you may have all the rich and fashionable\r\nbelles of our cities and villages.\r\n\r\n6. WASP WAISTS.--Marrying small waists is attended with consequences\r\nscarcely less disastrous than marrying rich and fashionable girls.\r\nAn amply developed chest is a sure indication of a naturally vigorous\r\nconstitution and a strong hold on life; while small waists indicate\r\nsmall and feeble vital organs, a delicate constitution, sickly\r\noffspring, and a short life. Beware of them, therefore, unless you\r\nwish your heart broken by the early death of your wife and children.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNTIL DEATH US DO PART.]\r\n\r\n7. MARRYING TALKERS.--In marrying a wit or a talker merely, though\r\nthe brilliant scintillations of the former, or the garrulity of the\r\nlatter, may amuse or delight you for the time being, yet you will\r\nderive no permanent satisfaction from these qualities, for there will\r\nbe no common bond of kindred feeling to assimilate your souls and hold\r\neach spell-bound at the shrine of the other's intellectual or moral\r\nexcellence.\r\n\r\n8. THE SECOND WIFE.--Many men, especially in choosing a second wife,\r\nare governed by her own qualifications as a housekeeper mainly, and\r\nmarry industry and economy. Though these traits of character are\r\nexcellent, yet a good housekeeper may be far from being a good wife.\r\nA good housekeeper, but a poor wife, may indeed prepare you a good\r\ndinner, and keep her house and children neat and tidy, yet this is but\r\na part of the office of a wife; who, besides all her household duties,\r\nhas those of a far higher order to perform. She should soothe you with\r\nher sympathies, divert your troubled mind, and make the whole family\r\nhappy by the gentleness of her manners, and the native goodness of her\r\nheart. A husband should also likewise do his part.\r\n\r\n9. DO NOT MARRY A MAN WITH A LOW, FLAT HEAD; for, however fascinating,\r\ngenteel, polite, tender, plausible or winning he may be, you will\r\nrepent the day of your espousal.\r\n\r\n10. HEALTHY WIRES AND MOTHERS.--Let girls romp, and let them range\r\nhill and dale in search of flowers, berries, or any other object of\r\namusement or attraction; let them bathe often, skip the rope, and take\r\na smart ride on horseback; often interspersing these amusements with\r\na turn of sweeping or washing, in order thereby to develop their vital\r\norgans, and thus lay a substantial physical foundation for becoming\r\ngood wives and mothers. The wildest romps usually make the best wives,\r\nwhile quiet, still, demure, sedate and sedentary girls are not worth\r\nhaving.\r\n\r\n11. SMALL STATURE.--In passing, I will just remark, that good size is\r\nimportant in wives and mothers. A small stature is objectionable in a\r\nwoman, because little women usually have too much activity for their\r\nstrength, and, consequently, feeble constitutions; hence they die\r\nyoung, and besides, being nervous, suffer extremely as mothers.\r\n\r\n12. HARD TIMES AND MATRIMONY.--Many persons, particularly young men,\r\nrefuse to marry, especially \"these hard time,\" because they cannot\r\nsupport a wife in the style they wish. To this I reply, that a good\r\nwife will care less for the style in which she is supported, than for\r\nyou. She will cheerfully conform to your necessities, and be happy\r\nwith you in a log-cabin. She will even help you support yourself.\r\nTo support a good wife, even if she have children, is really less\r\nexpensive than to board alone, besides being one of the surest means\r\nof acquiring property.\r\n\r\n13. MARRYING FOR A HOME.--Do not, however, marry for a home merely,\r\nunless you wish to become even more destitute with one than without\r\none; for, it is on the same footing with \"marrying for money.\" Marry a\r\nman for his merit; and you take no chances.\r\n\r\n14. MARRY TO PLEASE NO ONE BUT YOURSELF.--Marriage is a matter\r\nexclusively your own; because you alone must abide its consequences.\r\nNo person, not even a parent, has the least right to interfere or\r\ndictate in this matter. I never knew a marriage, made to please\r\nanother, to turn out any otherwise than most unhappily.\r\n\r\n15. DO NOT MARRY TO PLEASE YOUR PARENTS. Parents can not love for\r\ntheir children any more than they can eat or sleep, or breathe, or die\r\nand go to heaven for them. They may give wholesome advice merely,\r\nbut should leave the entire decision to the unbiased judgment of the\r\nparties themselves, who mainly are to experience the consequences of\r\ntheir choice. Besides, such is human nature, that to oppose lovers, or\r\nto speak against the person beloved, only increases their desire and\r\ndetermination to marry.\r\n\r\n16. RUN-AWAY MATCHES.--Many a run-away match would never have taken\r\nplace but for opposition or interference. Parents are mostly to be\r\nblamed for these elopements. Their children marry partly out of\r\nsprite and to be contrary. Their very natures tell them that\r\nthis interference is unjust--as it really is--and this excites\r\ncombativeness, firmness, and self-esteem, in combination with the\r\nsocial faculties, to powerful and even blind resistance--which turmoil\r\nof the faculties hastens the match. Let the affections of a daughter\r\nbe once slightly enlisted in your favor, and then let the \"old folks\"\r\nstart an opposition, and you may feel sure of your prize. If she did\r\nnot love you before, she will now, that you are persecuted.\r\n\r\n17. DISINHERITANCE.--Never disinherit, or threaten to disinherit, a\r\nchild for marrying against your will. If you wish a daughter not to\r\nmarry a certain man, oppose her, and she will be sure to marry him; so\r\nalso in reference to a son.\r\n\r\n18. PROPER TRAINING.--The secret is, however, all in a nutshell. Let\r\nthe father properly train his daughter, and she will bring her first\r\nlove-letter to him, and give him an opportunity to cherish a suitable\r\naffection, and to nip an improper one in the germ, before it has time\r\nto do any harm.\r\n\r\n19. THE FATAL MISTAKES OF PARENTS.--_There is, however one way of\r\neffectually preventing an improper match, and that is, not to allow\r\nyour children to associate with any whom you are unwilling they should\r\nmarry. How cruel as well at unjust to allow a daughter to associate\r\nwith a young man till the affections of both are riveted, and then\r\nforbid her marrying him. Forbid all association, or consent cheerfully\r\nto the marriage._\r\n\r\n20. AN INTEMPERATE LOVER.--Do not flatter yourselves young women, that\r\nyou can wean even an occasional wine drinker from his cups by love and\r\npersuasion. Ardent spirit at first, kindles up the fires of love into\r\nthe fierce flames of burning licentiousness, which burn out every\r\nelement of love and destroy every vestige of pure affection. It\r\nover-excites the passions, and thereby finally destroys it,--producing\r\nat first, unbridled libertinism, and then an utter barrenness of love;\r\nbesides reversing the other faculties of the drinker against his own\r\nconsort, and those of the wife against her drinking husband.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFIRST LOVE, DESERTION AND DIVORCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. FIRST LOVE.--This is the most important direction of all. The\r\nfirst love experiences a tenderness, a purity and unreservedness, an\r\nexquisiteness, a devotedness, and a poetry belonging to no subsequent\r\nattachment. \"Love, like life, has no second spring.\" Though a\r\nsecond attachment may be accompanied by high moral feeling, and to a\r\ndevotedness to the object loved; yet, let love be checked or\r\nblighted in its first pure emotion, and the beauty of its spring is\r\nirrecoverably withered and lost. This does not mean the simple love of\r\nchildren in the first attachment they call love, but rather the mature\r\nintelligent love of those of suitable age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUSICAL CULTURE LESSON.]\r\n\r\n2. FREE FROM TEMPTATIONS.--As long as his heart is bound up in its\r\nfirst bundle of love and devotedness--as long as his affections\r\nremain reciprocated and uninterrupted--so long temptations cannot take\r\neffect. This heart is callous to the charms of others, and the very\r\nidea of bestowing his affections upon another is abhorrent. Much more\r\nso is animal indulgence, which is morally impossible.\r\n\r\n3. SECOND LOVE NOT CONSTANT.--But let this first love be broken off,\r\nand the flood-gates of passion are raised. Temptations now flow\r\nin upon him. He casts a lustful eye upon every passing female,\r\nand indulges unchaste imaginations and feelings. Although his\r\nconscientiousness or intellect may prevent actual indulgence, yet\r\ntemptations now take effect, and render him liable to err; whereas\r\nbefore they had no power to awaken improper thoughts or feelings. Thus\r\nmany young men find their ruin.\r\n\r\n4. LEGAL MARRIAGE.--What would any woman give for merely a nominal\r\nor legal husband, just to live with and provide for her, but who\r\nentertained not one spark of love for her, or whose affections were\r\nbestowed upon another? How absurd, how preposterous the doctrine\r\nthat the obligations of marriage derive their sacredness from legal\r\nenactments and injunctions! How it literally profanes this holy of\r\nholies, and drags down this heaven-born institution from its original,\r\ndivine elevation, to the level of a merely human device. Who will dare\r\nto advocate the human institution of marriage without the warm heart\r\nof a devoted and loving companion!\r\n\r\n5. LEGISLATION.--But no human legislation can so guard this\r\ninstitution but that it may be broken in spirit, though, perhaps,\r\nacceded to in form; for, it is the heart which this institution\r\nrequires. There must be true and devoted affection, or marriage is a\r\nfarce and a failure.\r\n\r\n6. THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY AND THE LAW GOVERNING MARRIAGE are for the\r\nprotection of the individual, yet a man and woman may be married by\r\nlaw and yet unmarried in spirit. The law may tie together, and no\r\nmarriage be consummated. Marriage therefore is Divine, and \"whom God\r\nhath joined together let no man put asunder.\" A right marriage means a\r\nright state of the heart. A careful study of this work will be a great\r\nhelp to both the unmarried and the married.\r\n\r\n7. DESERTION AND DIVORCE.--For a young man to court a young woman,\r\nand excite her love till her affections are riveted, and then (from\r\nsinister motives, such as, to marry one richer, or more handsome), to\r\nleave her, and try elsewhere, is the very same crime as to divorce\r\nher from all that she holds dear on earth--to root up and pull out her\r\nimbedded affections, and to tear her from her rightful husband. First\r\nlove is always constant. The second love brings uncertainty--too often\r\ndesertions before marriage and divorces after marriage.\r\n\r\n8. THE COQUET.--The young woman to play the coquet, and sport with the\r\nsincere affections of an honest and devoted young man, is one of the\r\nhighest crimes that human nature can commit. Better murder him in body\r\ntoo, as she does in soul and morals, and it is the result of previous\r\ndisappointment, never the outcome of a sincere first love.\r\n\r\n9. ONE MARRIAGE. One evidence that second marriages are contrary\r\nto the laws of our social nature, is the fact that almost all\r\nstep-parents and step-children disagree. Now, what law has been\r\nbroken, to induce this penalty? The law of marriage; and this is one\r\nof the ways in which the breach punishes itself. It is much more in\r\naccordance with our natural feelings, especially those of mothers,\r\nthat children should be brought up by their own parent.\r\n\r\n10. SECOND MARRIAGE.--Another proof of this point is, that second\r\nmarriage is more a matter of business. \"I'll give you a home, if\r\nyou'll take care of my children.\" \"It's a bargain,\" is the way most\r\nsecond matches are made. There is little of the poetry of first-love,\r\nand little of the coyness and shrinking diffidence which characterize\r\nthe first attachment. Still these remarks apply almost equally to a\r\nsecond attachment, as to second marriage.\r\n\r\n11. THE CONCLUSION OF THE WHOLE MATTER.--Let this portion be read\r\nand pondered, and also the one entitled, \"Marry your First Love if\r\npossible,\" which assigns the cause, and points out the only remedy, of\r\nlicentiousness. As long as the main cause of this vice exists, and\r\nis aggravated by purse-proud, high-born, aristocratic parents and\r\nfriends, and even by the virtuous and religious, just so long, and\r\nexactly in the same ratio will this blighting Sirocco blast the\r\nfairest flowers of female innocence and lovliness, and blight our\r\nnoblest specimens of manliness. No sin of our land is greater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CLASSIC FRIEZE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW MANY YOUNG GIRLS ARE RUINED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFLIRTING AND ITS DANGERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. NO EXCUSE.--In this country there is no excuse for the young man\r\nwho seeks the society of the loose and the dissolute. There is at all\r\ntimes and everywhere open to him a society of persons of the opposite\r\nsex of his own age and of pure thoughts and lives, whose conversation\r\nwill refine him and drive from his bosom ignoble and impure thoughts.\r\n\r\n2. THE DANGERS.--The young man who may take pleasure in the fact that\r\nhe is the hero of half a dozen or more engagements and love episodes,\r\nlittle realizes that such constant excitement often causes not only\r\ndangerously frequent and long-continued nocturnal emissions, but\r\nmost painful affections of the testicles. Those who show too great\r\nfamiliarity with the other sex, who entertain lascivious thoughts,\r\ncontinually exciting the sexual desires, always suffer a weakening\r\nof power and sometimes the actual diseases of degeneration, chronic\r\ninflammation of the gland, spermatorrhoea, impotence, and the\r\nlike.--Young man, beware; your punishment for trifling with the\r\naffections of others may cost you a life of affliction.\r\n\r\n3. REMEDY.--Do not violate the social laws. Do not trifle with the\r\naffections of your nature. Do not give others countless anguish, and\r\nalso do not run the chances of injuring yourself and others for\r\nlife. The society of refined and pure women is one of the strongest\r\nsafeguards a young man can have, and he who seeks it will not\r\nonly find satisfaction, but happiness. Simple friendship and kind\r\naffections for each other will ennoble and benefit.\r\n\r\n4. THE TIME FOR MARRIAGE.--When a young man's means permit him to\r\nmarry, he should then look intelligently for her with whom he expects\r\nto pass the remainder of his life in perfect loyalty, and in sincerity\r\nand singleness of heart. Seek her to whom he is ready to swear to be\r\never true.\r\n\r\n5. BREACH OF CONFIDENCE.--Nothing is more certain, says Dr. Naphey,\r\nto undermine domestic felicity, and sap the foundation of marital\r\nhappiness, than marital infidelity. The risks of disease which a\r\nmarried man runs in impure intercourse are far more serious, because\r\nthey not only involve himself, but his wife and his children. He\r\nshould know that there is nothing which a woman will not forgive\r\nsooner than such a breach of confidence. He is exposed to the plots\r\nand is pretty certain sooner or later to fall into the snares of those\r\natrocious parties who subsist on black-mail. And should he escape\r\nthese complications, he still must lose self-respect, and carry about\r\nwith him the burden of a guilty conscience and a broken vow.\r\n\r\n6. SOCIETY RULES AND CUSTOMS.--A young man can enjoy the society\r\nof ladies without being a \"flirt.\" He can escort ladies to parties,\r\npublic places of interest, social gatherings, etc., without showing\r\nspecial devotion to any one special young lady. When he finds the\r\nchoice of his heart, then he will be justified to manifest it,\r\nand publicly proclaim it by paying her the compliment, exclusive\r\nattention. To keep a lady's company six months is a public\r\nannouncement of an engagement.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA WORD TO MAIDENS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. NO YOUNG LADY who is not willing to assume the responsibility of a\r\ntrue wife, and be crowned with the sacred diadem of motherhood, should\r\never think of getting married. We have too many young ladies to-day\r\nwho despise maternity, who openly vow that they will never be burdened\r\nwith children, and yet enter matrimony at the first opportunity. What\r\nis the result? Let echo answer, What? Unless a young lady believes\r\nthat motherhood is noble, is honorable, is divine, and she is willing\r\nto carry out that sacred function of her nature, she had a thousand\r\ntimes better refuse every proposal, and enter some honorable\r\noccupation and wisely die an old maid by choice.\r\n\r\n2. ON THE OTHER HAND, YOUNG LADY, never enter into the physical\r\nrelations of marriage with a man until you have conversed with him\r\nfreely and fully on these relations. Learn distinctly his views and\r\nfeelings and expectations in regard to that purest and most ennobling\r\nof all the functions of your nature, and the most sacred of all\r\nintimacies of conjugal love. Your self-respect, your beauty, your\r\nglory, your heaven, as a wife, will be more directly involved in his\r\nfeelings and views and practices, in regard to that relation, than in\r\nall other things. As you would not become a weak, miserable, imbecile,\r\nunlovable and degraded wife and mother, in the very prime of your\r\nlife, come to a perfect understanding with your chosen one, ere you\r\ncommit your person to his keeping in the sacred intimacies of home.\r\nBeware of that man who, under pretence of delicacy, modesty, and\r\npropriety, shuns conversation with you on this relation, and on the\r\nhallowed function of maternity.\r\n\r\n3. TALK WITH YOUR INTENDED frankly and openly. Remember, concealment\r\nand mystery in him, towards you, on all other subjects pertaining to\r\nconjugal union might be overlooked, but if he conceals his views here,\r\nrest assured it bodes no good to your purity and happiness as a wife\r\nand mother. You can have no more certain assurance that you are to be\r\nvictimized, your soul and body offered up, _slain_ on the altar of his\r\nsensualism, than his unwillingness to converse with you on subjects so\r\nvital to your happiness. Unless he is willing to hold his manhood\r\nin abeyance to the calls of your nature and to your conditions, and\r\nconsecrate its passions and its powers to the elevation and happiness\r\nof his wife and children, your maiden soul had better return to God\r\nunadorned with the diadem of conjugal and maternal love than that you\r\nshould become the wife of such man and the mother of his children.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROMAN LOVE MAKING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNIFORMED MEN ARE ALWAYS POPULAR.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPOPPING THE QUESTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. MAKING THE DECLARATION.--There are few emergencies in business and\r\nfew events in life that bring to man the trying ordeal of \"proposing\r\nto a lady.\" We should be glad to help the bashful lover in his hours\r\nof perplexity, embarrassment and hesitation, but unfortunately we\r\ncannot pop the question for him, nor give him a formula by which he\r\nmay do it. Different circumstances and different surroundings compel\r\nevery lover to be original in his form or mode of proposing.\r\n\r\n2. BASHFULNESS.--If a young man is very bashful, he should write his\r\nsentiments in a clear, frank manner on a neat white sheet of note\r\npaper, enclose it in a plain white envelope and find some way to\r\nconvey it to the lady's hand.\r\n\r\n3. THE ANSWER.--If the beloved one's heart is touched and she is\r\nin sympathy with the lover, the answer should be frankly and\r\nunequivocally given. If the negative answer is necessary, it should\r\nbe done in the kindest and most sympathetic language, yet definite,\r\npositive and to the point, and the gentleman should at once withdraw\r\nhis suit and continue friendly but not familiar.\r\n\r\n4. SAYING \"NO\" FOR \"YES.\"-If girls are foolish enough to say \"No\" when\r\nthey mean \"Yes,\" they must suffer the consequences which often follow.\r\nA man of intelligence and self-respect will not ask a lady twice. It\r\nis begging for recognition and lowers his dignity, should he do so.\r\nA lady is supposed to know her heart sufficiently to consider the\r\nquestion to her satisfaction before giving an answer.\r\n\r\n5. CONFUSION OF WORDS AND MISUNDERSTANDING.--Sometimes a man's\r\nhappiness, has depended on his manner of popping the question. Many\r\na time the girl has said \"No\" because the question was so worded that\r\nthe affirmative did not come from the mouth naturally; and two lives\r\nthat gravitated toward each other with all their inward force have\r\nbeen thrown suddenly apart, because the electric keys were not\r\ncarefully touched.\r\n\r\n6. SCRIPTURAL DECLARATION.--The church is not the proper place to\r\nconduct a courtship, yet the following is suggestive and ingenious.\r\n\r\nA young gentleman, familiar with the Scriptures, happening to sit in a\r\npew adjoining a young lady for whom he conceived a violent attachment,\r\nmade his proposal in this way. He politely handed his neighbor a Bible\r\nopen, with a pin stuck in the following text: Second Epistle of John,\r\nverse 5:\r\n\r\n\"And I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment\r\nunto thee, but that we had from the beginning, that we love one\r\nanother.\"\r\n\r\nShe returned it, pointing to the second chapter of Ruth, verse 10:\r\n\"Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said\r\nunto him. Why have I found grace in thine eyes that thou shouldest\r\ntake knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEALING THE ENGAGEMENT. From the Most Celebrated\r\nPainting in the German Department at the World's Fair.]\r\n\r\nHe returned the book, pointing to the 13th verse of the Third Epistle\r\nof John: \"Having many things to write unto you, I would not write to\r\nyou with paper and ink, but trust to come unto you and speak face to\r\nface, that your joy may be full.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the above interview a marriage took place the ensuing month in\r\nthe same church.\r\n\r\n7. HOW JENNY WAS WON.\r\n\r\n  On a sunny Summer morning,\r\n  Early as the dew was dry,\r\n  Up the hill I went a berrying;\r\n  Need I tell you--tell you why?\r\n\r\n  Farmer Davis had a daughter.\r\n  And it happened that I knew,\r\n  On each sunny morning, Jenny\r\n  Up the hill went berrying too.\r\n\r\n  Lonely work is picking berries,\r\n  So I joined her on the hill:\r\n  \"Jenny, dear,\" said I, \"your basket's\r\n  Quite too large for one to fill.\"\r\n\r\n  So we stayed--we two--to fill it,\r\n  Jenny talking--I was still.--\r\n  Leading where the hill was steepest,\r\n  Picking berries up the hill.\r\n\r\n  \"This is up-hill work,\" said Jenny;\r\n  \"So is life,\" said I; \"shall we\r\n  Climb it each alone, or, Jenny,\r\n  Will you come and climb with me?\"\r\n\r\n  Redder than the blushing berries\r\n  Jenny's cheek a moment grew,\r\n  While without delay she answered,\r\n  \"I will come and climb with you.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PERUVIAN BEAUTY.]\r\n\r\n8. A ROMANTIC WAY FOR PROPOSING.--In Peru they have a romantic way\r\nof popping the question. The suitor appears on the appointed evening,\r\nwith a gaily dressed troubadour under the balcony of his beloved. The\r\nsinger steps before her flower-bedecked window, and sings her beauties\r\nin the name of her lover. He compares her size to that of a pear tree,\r\nher lips to two blushing rose-buds, and her womanly form to that of a\r\ndove. With assumed harshness the lady asks her lover: Who are you, and\r\nwhat do you want? He answers with ardent confidence: \"Thy love I do\r\nadore. The stars live in the harmony of love, and why should not we,\r\ntoo, love each other?\" Then the proud beauty gives herself away: she\r\ntakes her flower-wreath from her hair and throws it down to her lover,\r\npromising to be his forever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BRIDE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE WEDDING.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE PROPER TIME.--Much has been printed in various volumes\r\nregarding the time of the year, the influence of the seasons, etc., as\r\ndetermining the proper time to set for the wedding day. Circumstances\r\nmust govern these things. To be sure, it is best to avoid extremes\r\nof heat and cold. Very hot weather is debilitating, and below zero is\r\nuncomfortable.\r\n\r\n2. THE LADY SHOULD SELECT THE DAY.--There is one element in the time\r\nthat is of great importance, physically, especially to the lady. It is\r\nthe day of the month, and it is hoped that every lady who contemplates\r\nmarriage is informed upon the great facts of ovulation. By reading\r\npage 244 she will understand that it is to her advantage to select\r\na wedding day about fifteen or eighteen days after the close of\r\nmenstruation in the month chosen, since it is not best that the first\r\nchild should be conceived during the excitement or irritation of first\r\nattempts at congress; besides modest brides naturally do not wish\r\nto become large with child before the season of congratulation and\r\nvisiting on their return from the \"wedding tour\" is over.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is asserted by many of the best writers on this subject,\r\nthat the mental condition of either parent at the time of intercourse\r\nwill be stamped upon the embryo hence it is not only best, but wise,\r\nthat the first-born should not be conceived until several months after\r\nmarriage, when the husband and wife have nicely settled in their new\r\nhome, and become calm in their experience of each other's society.\r\n\r\n3. THE \"BRIDAL TOUR\" is considered by many newly married couples as\r\na necessary introduction to a life of connubial joy. There is, in our\r\nopinion, nothing in the custom to recommend it. After the excitement\r\nand overwork before and accompanying a wedding, the period immediately\r\nfollowing should be one of _rest_.\r\n\r\nAgain, the money expended on the ceremony and a tour of the principal\r\ncities, etc., might, in most cases, be applied to a multitude of\r\nafter-life comforts of far more lasting value and importance. To be\r\nsure, it is not pleasant for the bride, should she remain at home,\r\nto pass through the ordeal of criticism and vulgar comments of\r\nacquaintances and friends, and hence, to escape this, the young couple\r\nfeel like getting away for a time. Undoubtedly the best plan for the\r\ngreat majority, after this most eventful ceremony, is to enter their\r\nfuture home at once, and there to remain in comparative privacy until\r\nthe novelty of the situation is worn off.\r\n\r\n4. IF THE CONVENTIONAL TOUR is taken, the husband should remember\r\nthat his bride cannot stand the same amount of tramping around and\r\nsight-seeing that he can. The female organs of generation are so\r\neasily affected by excessive exercise of the limbs which support\r\nthem, that at this critical period it would be a foolish and cosily\r\nexperience to drag a lady hurriedly around the country on an extensive\r\nand protracted round of sight-seeing or visiting. Unless good\r\ncommon-sense is displayed in the manner of spending the \"honey-moon,\"\r\nit will prove very untrue to its name. In many cases it lays the\r\nfoundation for the wife's first and life-long \"backache.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GYPSY BRIDE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nADVICE TO NEWLY MARRIED COUPLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. \"BE YE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY\" is a Bible commandment which the\r\nchildren of men habitually obey. However they may disagree on other\r\nsubjects, all are in accord on this; the barbarous, the civilized, the\r\nhigh, the low, the fierce, the gentle--all unite in the desire which\r\nfinds its accomplishment in the reproduction of their kind. Who shall\r\nquarrel with the Divinely implanted instinct, or declare it to be\r\nvulgar or unmentionable? It is during the period of the honeymoon that\r\nthe intensity of this desire, coupled with the greatest curiosity, is\r\nat its height, and the unbridled license often given the passions at\r\nthis time is attended with the most dangerous consequences.\r\n\r\n2. CONSUMMATION OF MARRIAGE.--The first time that the husband and wife\r\ncohabit together after the ceremony has been performed is called the\r\nconsummation of marriage. Many grave errors have been committed by\r\npeople in this, when one or both of the contracting parties were\r\nnot physically or sexually in a condition to carry out the marriage\r\nrelation. A marriage, however, is complete without this in the eyes\r\nof the law, as it is a maxim taken from the Roman civil statutes that\r\nconsent, not cohabitation, is the binding element in the ceremony.\r\nYet, in most States of the U.S., and in some other countries, marriage\r\nis legally declared void and of no effect where it is not possible to\r\nconsummate the marriage relation. A divorce may be obtained provided\r\nthe injured party begins the suit.\r\n\r\n3. TEST OF VIRGINITY.--The consummation of marriage with a virgin is\r\nnot necessarily attended with a flow of blood, and the absence of this\r\nsign is not the slightest presumption against her former chastity.\r\nThe true test of virginity is modesty void of any disagreeable\r\nfamiliarity. A sincere Christian faith is one of the best\r\nrecommendations.\r\n\r\n4. LET EVERY MAN REMEMBER that the legal right of marriage does not\r\ncarry with it the moral right to injure for life the loving companion\r\nhe has chosen. Ignorance may be the cause, but every man before\r\nhe marries should know something of the physiology and the laws of\r\nhealth, and we here give some information which is of very great\r\nimportance to every newly-married man.\r\n\r\n5. SENSUALITY.--Lust crucifies love. The young sensual husband is\r\ngenerally at fault. Passion sways and the duty to bride and wife is\r\nnot thought of, and so a modest young wife is often actually forced\r\nand assaulted by the unsympathetic haste of her husband. An amorous\r\nman in that way soon destroys his own love, and thus is laid the\r\nfoundation for many difficulties that soon develop trouble and disturb\r\nthe happiness of both.\r\n\r\n6. ABUSE AFTER MARRIAGE.--Usually marriage is consummated within a day\r\nor two after the ceremony, but this is gross injustice to the bride.\r\nIn most cases she is nervous, timid, and exhausted by the duties of\r\npreparation for the wedding, and in no way in a condition, either in\r\nbody or mind, for the vital change which the married relation bring\r\nupon her. Many a young husband often lays the foundation of many\r\ndiseases of the womb and of the nervous system in gratifying his\r\nunchecked passions without a proper regard for his wife's exhausted\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n7. THE FIRST CONJUGAL APPROACHES are usually painful to the new wife,\r\nand no enjoyment to her follows. Great caution and kindness should\r\nbe exercised. A young couple rushing together in their animal passion\r\nsoon produce a nervous and irritating condition which ere long brings\r\napathy, indifference, if not dislike. True love and a high regard for\r\neach other will temper passion into moderation.\r\n\r\n8. WERE THE ABOVE INJUNCTIONS HEEDED fully and literally it would\r\nbe folly to say more, but this would be omitting all account of the\r\nbridegroom's new position, the power of his passion, and the timidity\r\nof the fair creature who is wondering what fate has in store for her\r\ntrembling modesty. To be sure, there are some women who are possessed\r\nof more forward natures and stronger desires than others. In such\r\ncases there may be less trouble.\r\n\r\n9. A COMMON ERROR.--The young husband may have read in some treatise\r\non physiology that the hymen in a virgin is the great obstacle to be\r\novercome. He is apt to conclude that this is all, that some force will\r\nbe needed to break it down, and that therefore an amount of urgency\r\neven to the degree of inflicting considerable pain is justifiable.\r\nThis is usually wrong. It rarely constitutes any obstruction and, even\r\nwhen its rupturing may be necessary, it alone seldom causes suffering.\r\n\r\nThere are sometimes certain deformities of the vagina, but no woman\r\nshould knowingly seek matrimonial relations when thus afflicted.\r\n\r\nWe quote from Dr. C.A. Huff the following:\r\n\r\n10. \"WHAT IS IT, THEN, THAT USUALLY CAUSES distress to many women,\r\nwhether a bride or a long-time wife?\" The answer is, Simply those\r\nconditions of the organs in which they are not properly prepared, by\r\nanticipation and desire, to receive a foreign body. The modest one\r\ncraves only refined and platonic love at first, and if husbands, new\r\nand old, would only realize this plain truth, wife-torturing would\r\ncease and the happiness of each one of all human pairs vastly\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\n11. THE CONDITIONS OF THE FEMALE organs depend upon the state of the\r\nmind just as much as in the case of the husband. The male, however,\r\nbeing more sensual, is more quickly roused. She is far less often or\r\nearly ready. In its unexcited state the vagina is lax, its walls are\r\nclosed together, and their surfaces covered by but little lubricating\r\nsecretion. The chaster one of the pair has no desire that this sacred\r\nvestibule to the great arcana of procreation shall be immediately and\r\nroughly invaded. This, then, is the time for all approaches by\r\nthe husband to be of the most delicate, considerate, and refined\r\ndescription possible. The quietest and softest demeanor, with gentle\r\nand re-assuring words, are all that should be attempted at first. The\r\nwedding day has probably been one of fatigue, and it is foolish to go\r\nfarther.\r\n\r\n12. FOR MORE THAN ONE NIGHT it will be wise, indeed, if the wife's\r\nconfidence shall be as much wooed and won by patient, delicate, and\r\nprolonged courting, as before the marriage engagement. How long should\r\nthis period of waiting be can only be decided by the circumstances of\r\nany case. The bride will ultimately deny no favor which is sought with\r\nfull deference to her modesty, and in connection with which bestiality\r\nis not exhibited. Her nature is that of delicacy; her affection is\r\nof a refined character; if the love and conduct offered to her are a\r\ncareful effort to adapt roughness and strength to her refinement and\r\nweakness, her admiration and responsive love will be excited to the\r\nutmost.\r\n\r\n13. WHEN THAT MOMENT ARRIVES when the bride finds she can repose\r\nperfect confidence in the kindness of her husband, that his love is\r\nnot purely animal, and that no violence will be attempted, the power\r\nof her affection for him will surely assert itself; the mind will\r\nact on those organs which nature has endowed to fulfil the law of\r\nher being, the walls of the vagina will expand, and the glands at\r\nthe entrance will be fully lubricated by a secretion of mucous which\r\nrenders congress a matter of comparative ease.\r\n\r\n14. WHEN THIS RESPONSIVE ENLARGEMENT and lubrication are fully\r\nrealized, it is made plain why the haste and force so common to first\r\nand subsequent coition, is, as it has been justly called, nothing but\r\n\"legalized rape.\" Young husband, Prove your manhood, not by yielding\r\nto unbridled lust and cruelty, but by the exhibition of true power in\r\n_self-control_ and patience with the helpless being confided to your\r\ncare. Prolong the delightful season of courting into and _through_\r\nwedded life and rich shall be your reward.\r\n\r\n15. A WANT OF DESIRE may often prevail, and may be caused by loss\r\nof sleep, study, constant thought, mental disturbance, anxiety,\r\nself-abuse, excessive use of tobacco or alcoholic drink, etc. Overwork\r\nmay cause debility; a man may not have an erection for months, yet it\r\nmay not be a sign of debility, sexual lethargy or impotence. Get the\r\nmind and the physical constitution in proper condition, and most all\r\nthese difficulties will disappear. Good athletic exercise by walking,\r\nriding, or playing croquet, or any other amusement, will greatly\r\nimprove the condition. A good rest, however, will be necessary to\r\nfully restore the mind and the body, then the natural condition of the\r\nsexual organs will be resumed.\r\n\r\n16. HAVING TWINS.--Having twins is undoubtedly hereditary and\r\ndescends from generation to generation, and persons who have twins\r\nare generally those who have great sexual vigor. It is generally the\r\nresult of a second cohabitation immediately following the first, but\r\nsome parents have twins who cohabit but once during several days.\r\n\r\n17. PROPER INTERCOURSE.--The right relation of a newly-married couple\r\nwill rather increase than diminish love. To thus offer up the maiden\r\non the altar of love and affection only swells her flood of joy\r\nand bliss; whereas, on the other hand, sensuality humbles, debases,\r\npollutes, and never elevates. Young husbands should wait for an\r\n_invitation to the banquet_ and they will be amply paid by the very\r\npleasure sought. Invitation or permission delights, and possession by\r\nforce degrades. The right-minded bridegroom will postpone the exercise\r\nof his nuptial rights for a few days, and allow his young wife to\r\nbecome rested from the preparation and fatigue of the wedding, and\r\nbecome accustomed to the changes in her new relations of life.\r\n\r\n18. RIGHTLY BEGINNING SEXUAL LIFE.--Intercourse promotes all the\r\nfunctions of the body and mind, but rampant just and sexual abuses\r\nsoon destroy the natural pleasures of intercourse, and unhappiness\r\nwill be the result. Remember that _intercourse_ should not become the\r\npolluted purpose of marriage. To be sure, rational enjoyment benefits\r\nand stimulates love, but the pleasure of each other's society,\r\nstanding together on all questions of mutual benefit, working hand in\r\nhand and shoulder to shoulder in the battle of life, raising a family\r\nof beautiful children, sharing each other's joys and sorrows, are\r\nthe things that bring to every couple the best, purest, and noblest\r\nenjoyment that God has bestowed upon man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TURKISH HAREM.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSEXUAL PROPRIETIES AND IMPROPRIETIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. To have offspring is not to be regarded as a luxury, but as a\r\ngreat primary necessity of health and happiness, of which every\r\nfully-developed man and woman should have a fair share, while it\r\ncannot be denied that the ignorance of the necessity of sexual\r\nintercourse to the health and virtue of both man and woman is the most\r\nfundamental error in medical and moral philosophy.\r\n\r\n2. In a state of pure nature, where man would have his sexual\r\ninstincts under full and natural restraint, there would be little,\r\nif any, licentiousness, and children would be the result of natural\r\ndesire, and not the accidents of lust.\r\n\r\n3. This is an age of sensuality; unnatural passions cultivated and\r\nindulged. Young people in the course of their engagement often sow\r\nthe seed of serious excesses. This habit of embracing, sitting on the\r\nlover's lap, leaning on his breast, long and uninterrupted periods of\r\nsecluded companionship, have become so common that it is amazing how\r\na young lady can safely arrive at the wedding day. While this conduct\r\nmay safely terminate with the wedding day, yet it cultivates the\r\ntendency which often results in excessive indulgencies after the\r\nhoney-moon is over.\r\n\r\n4. SEPARATE BEDS.--Many writers have vigorously championed as a reform\r\nthe practice of separate beds for husband and wife. While we would not\r\nrecommend such separation, it is no doubt very much better for both\r\nhusband and wife, in case the wife is pregnant. Where people are\r\nreasonably temperate, no such ordinary precautions as separate\r\nsleeping places may be necessary. But in case of pregnancy it will\r\nadd rest to the mother and add vigor to the unborn child. Sleeping\r\ntogether, however, is natural and cultivates true affection, and it\r\nis physiologically true that in very cold weather life is prolonged by\r\nhusband and wife sleeping together.\r\n\r\n5. THE AUTHORITY OF THE WIFE.--Let the wife judge whether she desires\r\na separate couch or not. She has the superior right to control her own\r\nperson. In such diseases as consumption, or other severe or lingering\r\ndiseases, separate beds should always be insisted upon.\r\n\r\n6. THE TIME FOR INDULGENCE.--The health of the generative functions\r\ndepends upon exercise, just the same as any other vital organ.\r\nIntercourse should be absolutely avoided just before or after meals,\r\nor just after mental excitement or physical exercise. No wife should\r\nindulge her husband when he is under the influence of alcoholic\r\nstimulants, for idiocy and other serious maladies are liable to be\r\nvisited upon the offspring.\r\n\r\n7. RESTRAINT DURING PREGNANCY.--There is no question but what moderate\r\nindulgence during the first few months of pregnancy does not result\r\nin serious harm; but people who excessively satisfy their ill-governed\r\npassions are liable to pay a serious penalty.\r\n\r\n8. MISCARRIAGE.--If a woman is liable to abortion or miscarriage,\r\nabsolute abstinence is the only remedy. No sexual indulgence during\r\npregnancy can be safely tolerated.\r\n\r\n9. It is better for people not to marry until they are of proper age.\r\nIt is a physiological fact that men seldom reach the full maturity\r\nor their virile power before the age of twenty-five, and the female\r\nrarely attains the full vigor of her sexual powers before the age of\r\ntwenty.\r\n\r\n10. ILLICIT PLEASURES.--The indulgence of illicit pleasures, says\r\nDr. S. Pancoast, sooner or later is sure to entail the most loathsome\r\ndiseases on their votaries. Among these diseases are Gonorrhoea,\r\nSyphilis, Spermatorrhoea (waste of semen by daily and nightly\r\ninvoluntary emissions), Satyriasis (a species of sexual madness, or\r\na sexual diabolism, causing men to commit rape and other beastly acts\r\nand outrages, not only on women and children, but men and animals, as\r\nsodomy, pederasty, etc.), Nymphomania (causing women to assail every\r\nman they meet, and supplicate and excite him to gratify their lustful\r\npassions, or who resort to means of sexual pollutions, which is\r\nimpossible to describe without shuddering), together with spinal\r\ndiseases and many disorders of the most distressing and disgusting\r\ncharacter filling the bones with rottenness, and eating away the\r\nflesh by gangrenous ulcers, until the patient dies, a horrible mass of\r\nputridity and corruption.\r\n\r\n11. SENSUALITY.--Sensuality is not love, but an unbridled desire which\r\nkills the soul. Sensuality will drive away the roses in the cheeks of\r\nwomanhood, undermine health and produce a brazen countenance that can\r\nbe read by all men. The harlot may commit her sins in the dark, but\r\nher countenance reveals her character and her immorality is an open\r\nsecret.\r\n\r\n12. SEXUAL TEMPERANCE.--All excesses and absurdities of every kind\r\nshould be carefully avoided. Many of the female disorders which often\r\nrevenge themselves in the cessation of all sexual pleasure are largely\r\ndue to the excessive practice of sexual indulgence.\r\n\r\n13. FREQUENCY.--Some writers claim that intercourse should never\r\noccur except for the purpose of childbearing but such restraint is\r\nnot natural and consequently not conducive to health. There are many\r\nconditions in which the health of the mother and offspring must be\r\nrespected. It is now held that it is nearer a crime than a virtue to\r\nprostitute woman to the degradation of breeding animals by compelling\r\nher to bring into life more offspring than can be born healthy, or be\r\nproperly cared for and educated.\r\n\r\n14. In this work we shall attempt to specify no rule, but simply give\r\nadvice as to the health and happiness of both man and wife. A man\r\nshould not gratify his own desires at the expense of his wife's\r\nhealth, comfort or inclination. Many men no doubt harass their wives\r\nand force many burdens upon their slender constitutions. But it is a\r\ngreat sin and no true husband will demand unreasonable recognition.\r\nThe wife when physically able, however, should bear with her husband.\r\nMan is naturally sensitive on this subject, and it takes but little to\r\nalienate his affections and bring discover into the family.\r\n\r\n15. The best writers lay down the rule for the government of the\r\nmarriage-bed, that sexual indulgence should only occur about once in a\r\nweek or ten days, and this of course applies only to those who enjoy\r\na fair degree of health. But it is a hygienic and physiological fact\r\nthat those who indulge only once a month receive a far greater degree\r\nof the intensity of enjoyment than those who indulge their passions\r\nmore frequently. Much pleasure is lost by excesses where much might be\r\ngained by temperance giving rest to the organs for the accumulation of\r\nnervous force.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHOW TO PERPETUATE THE HONEY-MOON.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. CONTINUE YOUR COURTSHIP.--Like causes produce like effects.\r\n\r\n2. NEGLECT OF YOUR COMPANION.--Do not assume a right to neglect your\r\ncompanion more after marriage than you did before.\r\n\r\n3. SECRETS.--Have no secrets that you keep from your companion. A\r\nthird party is always disturbing.\r\n\r\n4. AVOID THE APPEARANCE OF EVIL.--In matrimonial matters it is often\r\nthat the mere appearance contains all the evil. Love, as soon as it\r\nrises above calculation and becomes love, is exacting. It gives all,\r\nand demands all.\r\n\r\n5. ONCE MARRIED, NEVER OPEN YOUR MIND TO ANY CHANGE. If you keep the\r\ndoor of your purpose closed, evil or even desirable changes cannot\r\nmake headway without help.\r\n\r\n6. KEEP STEP IN MENTAL DEVELOPMENT.--A tree that grows for forty years\r\nmay take all the sunlight from a tree that stops growing at twenty.\r\n\r\n7. KEEP A LIVELY INTEREST IN THE BUSINESS OF THE HOME.--Two that do\r\nnot pull together are weaker than either alone.\r\n\r\n8. GAUGE YOUR EXPENSES BY YOUR REVENUES.--Love must eat. The sheriff\r\noften levies on Cupid long before he takes away the old furniture.\r\n\r\n9. START FROM WHERE YOUR PARENTS STARTED RATHER THAN FROM WHERE THEY\r\nNOW ARE.--Hollow and showy boarding often furnishes the too strong\r\ntemptation, while the quietness of a humble home would cement the\r\nhearts beyond risk.\r\n\r\n10. AVOID DEBT.--Spend your own money, but earn it first, then it will\r\nnot be necessary to blame any one for spending other people's.\r\n\r\n11. DO NOT BOTH GET ANGRY AT THE SAME TIME.--Remember, it takes two to\r\nquarrel.\r\n\r\n12. DO NOT ALLOW YOURSELF EVER TO COME TO AN OPEN RUPTURE.--Things\r\nunsaid need less repentance.\r\n\r\n13. STUDY TO CONFORM YOUR TASTES AND HABITS TO THE TASTES AND HABITS\r\nOF YOUR COMPANION.--If two walk together, they must agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHOW TO BE A GOOD WIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. REVERENCE YOUR HUSBAND.--He sustains by God's order a position of\r\ndignity as head of a family, head of the woman. Any breaking down\r\nof this order indicates a mistake in the union, or a digression from\r\nduty.\r\n\r\n2. LOVE HIM.--A wife loves as naturally as the sun shines. Love is\r\nyour best weapon. You conquered him with that in the first place. You\r\ncan reconquer by the same means.\r\n\r\n3. DO NOT CONCEAL YOUR LOVE FROM HIM.--If he is crowded with care, and\r\ntoo busy to seem to heed your love, you need to give all the greater\r\nattention to securing his knowledge of your love. If you intermit he\r\nwill settle down into a hard, cold life with increased rapidity. Your\r\nexample will keep the light on his conviction. The more he neglects\r\nthe fire on the hearth, the more carefully must you feed and guard\r\nit. It must not be allowed to go out. Once out you must sit ever in\r\ndarkness and in the cold.\r\n\r\n4. CULTIVATE THE MODESTY AND DELICACY OF YOUR YOUTH.--The relations\r\nand familiarity of wedded life may seem to tone down the sensitive\r\nand retiring instincts of girlhood, but nothing can compensate for the\r\nloss of these. However, much men may admire the public performance of\r\ngifted women, they do not desire that boldness and dash in a wife.\r\nThe holy blush of a maiden's modesty is more powerful in hallowing and\r\ngoverning a home than the heaviest armament that ever a warrior bore.\r\n\r\n5. CULTIVATE PERSONAL ATTRACTIVENESS.--This means the storing of your\r\nmind with a knowledge of passing events, and with a good idea of the\r\nworld's general advance. If you read nothing, and make no effort to\r\nmake yourself attractive, you will soon sink down into a dull hack of\r\nstupidity. If your husband never hears from you any words of wisdom,\r\nor of common information, he will soon hear nothing from you. Dress\r\nand gossips soon wear out. If your memory is weak, so that it hardly\r\nseems worth while to read, that is additional reason for reading.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TALKING BEFORE MARRIAGE.]\r\n\r\n6. CULTIVATE PHYSICAL ATTRACTIVENESS.--When you were encouraging the\r\nattentions of him whom you now call husband, you did not neglect any\r\nitem of dress or appearance that could help you. Your hair was always\r\nin perfect training. You never greeted him with a ragged or untidy\r\ndress or soiled hands. It is true that your \"market is made,\" but you\r\ncannot afford to have it \"broken.\" Cleanliness and good taste will\r\nattract now as they did formerly. Keep yourself at your best. Make\r\nthe most of physical endowments. Neatness and order break the power of\r\npoverty.\r\n\r\n7. STUDY YOUR HUSBAND'S CHARACTER.--He has his peculiarities. He has\r\nno right to many of them, and you need to know them; thus you can\r\navoid many hours of friction. The good pilot steers around the sunken\r\nrocks that lie in the channel. The engineer may remove them, not the\r\npilot. You are more pilot than engineer. Consult his tastes. It is\r\nmore important to your home, that you should please him than anybody\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n8. PRACTICE ECONOMY.--Many families are cast out of peace into\r\ngrumbling and discord by being compelled to fight against poverty.\r\nWhen there are no great distresses to be endured or accounted for,\r\ncomplaint and fault-finding are not so often evoked. Keep your husband\r\nfree from the annoyance of disappointed creditors, and he will be more\r\napt to keep free from annoying you. To toil hard for bread, to fight\r\nthe wolf from the door, to resist impatient creditors, to struggle\r\nagainst complaining pride at home, is too much to ask of one man. A\r\ncrust that is your own is a feast, while a feast that is purloined\r\nfrom unwilling creditors if a famine.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHOW TO BE A GOOD HUSBAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. SHOW YOUR LOVE.--All life manifests itself. As certainly as a live\r\ntree will put forth leaves in the spring, so certainly will a living\r\nlove show itself. Many a noble man toils early and late to earn bread\r\nand position for his wife. He hesitates at no weariness for her sake.\r\nHe justly thinks that such industry and providence give a better\r\nexpression of his love than he could by caressing her and letting the\r\ngrocery bills go unpaid. He fills the cellar and pantry. He drives and\r\npushes his business. He never dreams that he is actually starving his\r\nwife to death. He may soon have a woman left to superintend his home,\r\nbut his wife is dying. She must be kept alive by the same process that\r\ncalled her into being. Recall and repeat the little attentions and\r\ndelicate compliments that once made you so agreeable, and that fanned\r\nher love into a consuming flame. It is not beneath the dignity of the\r\nskillful physician to study all the little symptoms, and order all the\r\nlittle round of attentions that check the waste of strength and brace\r\nthe staggering constitution. It is good work for a husband to cherish\r\nhis wife.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TALKING AFTER MARRIAGE.]\r\n\r\n2. CONSULT WITH YOUR WIFE.--She is apt to be as right as you are, and\r\nfrequently able to add much to your stock of wisdom. In any event she\r\nappreciates your attentions.\r\n\r\n3. STUDY TO KEEP HER YOUNG.--It can be done. It is not work, but\r\nworry, that wears. Keep a brave, true heart between her and all harm.\r\n\r\n4. HELP TO BEAR HER BURDENS.--Bear one another's burdens, and so\r\nfulfill the law of love. Love seeks opportunities to do for the loved\r\nobject. She has the constant care of your children. She is ordained\r\nby the Lord to stand guard over them. Not a disease can appear in the\r\ncommunity without her taking the alarm. Not a disease can come over\r\nthe threshold without her instantly springing into the mortal combat.\r\nIf there is a deficiency anywhere it comes out of her pleasure. Her\r\nburdens are everywhere. Look for them, that you may lighten them.\r\n\r\n5. MAKE YOURSELF HELPFUL BY THOUGHTFULNESS.--Remember to bring into\r\nthe house your best smile and sunshine. It is good for you, and it\r\ncheers up the home. There is hardly a nook in the house that has not\r\nbeen carefully hunted through to drive out everything that might annoy\r\nyou. The dinner which suits, or ought to suit you, has not come on the\r\ntable of itself. It represents much thoughtfulness and work. You can\r\ndo no more manly thing than find some way of expressing, in word or\r\nlook, your appreciation of it.\r\n\r\n6. EXPRESS YOUR WILL, NOT BY COMMANDS, BUT BY SUGGESTIONS.--It is\r\nGod's order that you should be the head of the family. You are clothed\r\nwith authority. But this does not authorize you to be stern and harsh,\r\nas an officer in the army. Your authority is the dignity of love.\r\nWhen it is not clothed in love it ceases to have the substance of\r\nauthority. A simple suggestion that may embody a wish, an opinion or\r\nan argument, becomes one who reigns over such a kingdom as yours.\r\n\r\n7. SEEK TO REFINE YOUR NATURE.--It is no slander to say that many men\r\nhave wives much more refined than themselves. This is natural in the\r\ninequalities of life. Other qualities may compensate for any defect\r\nhere. But you need have no defect in refinement. Preserve the\r\ngentleness and refinement of your wife as a rich legacy for your\r\nchildren, and in so doing you will lift yourself to higher levels.\r\n\r\n8. BE A GENTLEMAN AS WELL AS A HUSBAND.--The signs and bronze and\r\ncallouses of toil are no indications that you are not a gentleman.\r\nThe soul of gentlemanliness is a kindly feeling toward others, that\r\nprompts one to secure their comfort. That is why the thoughtful\r\npeasant lover is always so gentlemanly, and in his love much above\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n9. STAY AT HOME.--Habitual absence during the evenings is sure to\r\nbring sorrow. If your duty or business calls you you have the promise\r\nthat you will be kept in all your ways. But if you go out to mingle\r\nwith other society, and leave your wife at home alone, or with the\r\nchildren and servants, know that there is no good in store for you.\r\nShe has claims upon you that you can not afford to allow to go to\r\nprotest. Reverse the case. You sit down alone after having waited\r\nall day for your wife's return, and think of her as reveling in gay\r\nsociety, and see if you can keep out all the doubts as to what takes\r\nher away. If your home is not as attractive as you want it, you are\r\na principal partner. Set yourself about the work of making it\r\nattractive.\r\n\r\n10. TAKE YOUR WIFE WITH YOU INTO SOCIETY.--Seclusion begets\r\nmorbidness. She needs some of the life that comes from contact with\r\nsociety. She must see how other people appear and act. It often\r\nrequires an exertion for her to go out of her home, but it is good for\r\nher and for you. She will bring back more sunshine. It is wise to rest\r\nsometimes. When the Arab stops for his dinner he unpacks his camel.\r\nTreat your wife with as much consideration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TIRED OF LIFE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCAUSE OF FAMILY TROUBLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. MUCH BETTER TO BE ALONE.--He who made man said it is not good for\r\nhim to be alone; but it is much better to be alone, than it is to be\r\nin some kinds of company. Many couples who felt unhappy when they were\r\napart, have been utterly miserable when together; and scores who have\r\nbeen ready to go through fire and water to get married, have been\r\nwilling to run the risk of fire and brimstone to get divorced. It is\r\nby no means certain that because persons are wretched before marriage\r\nthey will be happy after it. The wretchedness of many homes, and the\r\nprevalence of immorality and divorce is a sad commentary on the evils\r\nwhich result from unwise marriages.\r\n\r\n2. UNAVOIDABLE EVILS.--There are plenty of unavoidable evils in this\r\nworld, and it is mournful to think of the multitudes who are preparing\r\nthemselves for needless disappointments, and who yet have no fear,\r\nand are unwilling to be instructed, cautioned or warned. To them\r\nthe experience of mature life is of little account compared with the\r\nwisdom of ardent and enthusiastic youth.\r\n\r\n3. MATRIMONIAL INFELICITY.--One great cause of matrimonial infelicity\r\nis the hasty marriages of persons who have no adequate knowledge of\r\neach other's characters. Two strangers become acquainted, and are\r\nattracted to each other, and without taking half the trouble to\r\ninvestigate or inquire that a prudent man would take before buying a\r\nsaddle horse, they are married. In a few weeks or months it is perhaps\r\nfound that one of the parties was married already, or possibly that\r\nthe man is drunken or vicious, or the woman anything but what she\r\nshould be. Then begins the bitter part of the experience: shame,\r\ndisgrace, scandal, separation, sin and divorce, all come as the\r\nnatural results of a rash and foolish marriage. A little time spent\r\nin honest, candid, and careful preliminary inquiry and investigations\r\nwould have saved the trouble.\r\n\r\n4. THE CLIMAX.--It has been said that a man is never utterly ruined\r\nuntil he has married a bad woman. So the climax of woman's miseries\r\nand sorrows may be said to come only when she is bound with that bond\r\nwhich should be her chiefest blessing and her highest joy, but which\r\nmay prove her deepest sorrow and her bitterest curse.\r\n\r\n5. THE FOLLY OF FOLLIES.--There are some lessons which people are very\r\nslow to learn, and yet which are based upon the simple principles of\r\ncommon-sense. A young lady casts her eye upon a young man. She says,\r\n\"I mean to have that man.\" She plies her arts, engages his\r\naffections, marries him, and secures for herself a life of sorrow and\r\ndisappointment, ending perhaps in a broken up home or an early grave.\r\nAny prudent, intelligent person of mature age, might have warned or\r\ncautioned her; but she sought no advice, and accepted no admonition. A\r\nyoung man may pursue a similar course with equally disastrous results.\r\n\r\n6. HAP-HAZARD.--Many marriages are undoubtedly arranged by what may be\r\ntermed the accident of locality. Persons live near each other, become\r\nacquainted, and engage themselves to those whom they never would have\r\nselected as their companions in life if they had wider opportunities\r\nof acquaintance. Within the borders of their limited circle they make\r\na selection which may be wise or may be unwise. They have no means\r\nof judging, they allow no one else to judge for them. The results are\r\nsometimes happy and sometimes unhappy in the extreme. It is well\r\nto act cautiously in doing what can be done but once. It is not a\r\npleasant experience for a person to find out a mistake when it is too\r\nlate to rectify it.\r\n\r\n7. WE ALL CHANGE.--When two persons of opposite sex are often thrown\r\ntogether they are very naturally attracted to each other, and are\r\nliable to imbibe the opinion that they are better fitted for life-long\r\ncompanionship than any other two persons in the world. This may be the\r\ncase, or it may not be. There are a thousand chances against such a\r\nconclusion to one in favor of it. But even if at the present moment\r\nthese two persons were fitted to be associated, no one can tell\r\nwhether the case will be the same five or ten years hence. Men change;\r\nwomen change; they are not the same they were ten years ago; they are\r\nnot the same they will be ten years hence.\r\n\r\n8. THE SAFE RULE.--Do not be in a hurry; take your time and consider\r\nwell before you allow your devotion to rule you. Study first your\r\ncharacter, then study the character of her whom you desire to\r\nmarry. Love works mysteriously, and if it will bear careful and cool\r\ninvestigation, it will no doubt thrive under adversity. When people\r\nmarry they unite their destinies for the better or the worse. Marriage\r\nis a contract for life and will never bear a hasty conclusion. _Never\r\nbe in a hurry_!\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJEALOUSY--ITS CAUSE AND CURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Trifles, light as air\r\n  Are to the jealous confirmations strong,\r\n  As proofs of holy writ.--SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\n  Nor Jealousy\r\n  Was understood, the injur'd lover's hell.--MILTON\r\n\r\n  O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;\r\n  It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock\r\n  The meat it feeds on.--SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. DEFINITION.--Jealousy is an accidental passion, for which the\r\nfaculty indeed is unborn. In its nobler form and in its nobler motives\r\nit arises from love, and in its lower form it arises from the deepest\r\nand darkest Pit of Satan.\r\n\r\n2. HOW DEVELOPED.--Jealousy arises either from weakness, which from a\r\nsense of its own want of lovable qualities is not convinced of being\r\nsure of its cause, or from distrust, which thinks the beloved person\r\ncapable of infidelity. Sometimes all these motives may act together.\r\n\r\n3. NOBLEST JEALOUSY.--The noblest jealousy, if the term noble is\r\nappropriate, is a sort of ambition or pride of the loving person who\r\nfeels it is an insult that another one should assume it as possible to\r\nsupplant his love, or it is the highest degree of devotion which sees\r\na declaration of its object in the foreign invasion, as it were, of\r\nhis own altar. Jealousy is always a sign that a little more wisdom\r\nmight adorn the individual without harm.\r\n\r\n4. THE LOWEST JEALOUSY.--The lowest species of jealousy is a sort of\r\navarice of envy which, without being capable of love, at least wishes\r\nto possess the object of its jealousy alone by the one party assuming\r\na sort of property right over the other. This jealousy, which might\r\nbe called the Satanic, is generally to be found with old withered\r\n\"husbands,\" whom the devil has prompted to marry young women and who\r\nforthwith dream night and day of cuck-old's horns. These Argus-eyed\r\nkeepers are no longer capable of any feeling that could be called\r\nlove, they are rather as a rule heartless house-tyrants, and are in\r\nconstant dread that some one may admire or appreciate his unfortunate\r\nslave.\r\n\r\n5. WANT OF LORE.--The general conclusion will be that jealousy is more\r\nthe result of wrong conditions which cause uncongenial unions, and\r\nwhich through moral corruption artificially create distrust than a\r\nnecessary accompaniment of love.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEEKING THE LIFE OF A RIVAL.]\r\n\r\n6. RESULT OF POOR OPINION.--Jealousy is a passion with which those are\r\nmost afflicted who are the least worthy of love. An innocent maiden\r\nwho enters marriage will not dream of getting jealous; but all her\r\ninnocence cannot secure her against the jealousy of her husband if he\r\nhas been a libertine. Those are wont to be the most jealous who have\r\nthe consciousness that they themselves are most deserving of jealousy.\r\nMost men in consequence of their present education and corruption have\r\nso poor an opinion not only of the male, but even of the female sex,\r\nthat they believe every woman at every moment capable of what they\r\nthemselves have looked for among all and have found among the most\r\nunfortunate, the prostitutes. No libertine can believe in the purity\r\nof woman; it is contrary to nature. A libertine therefore cannot\r\nbelieve in the loyalty of a faithful wife.\r\n\r\n7. WHEN JUSTIFIABLE.--There may be occasions where jealousy is\r\njustifiable. If a woman's confidence has been shaken in her husband,\r\nor a husband's confidence has been shaken in his wife by certain signs\r\nor conduct, which have no other meaning but that of infidelity, then\r\nthere is just cause for jealousy. There must, however, be certain\r\nproof as evidence of the wife's or husband's immoral conduct.\r\nImaginations or any foolish absurdities should have no consideration\r\nwhatever, and let everyone have confidence until his or her faith has\r\nbeen shaken by the revelation of absolute facts.\r\n\r\n8. CAUTION AND ADVICE.--No couple should allow their associations\r\nto develop into an engagement and marriage if either one has any\r\ninclination to jealousy. It shows invariably a want of sufficient\r\nconfidence, and that want of confidence, instead of being diminished\r\nafter marriage, is liable to increase, until by the aid of the\r\nimagination and wrong interpretation the home is made a hell and\r\ndivorce a necessity. Let it be remembered, there can be no true love\r\nwithout perfect and absolute confidence, jealousy is always the sign\r\nof weakness or madness. Avoid a jealous disposition, for it is an open\r\nacknowledgment of a lack of faith.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE IMPROVEMENT OF OFFSPRING.\r\n\r\nWhy Bring Into the World Idiots, Fools, Criminals and Lunatics?\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE RIGHT WAY.--When mankind will properly love AND marry and then\r\nrightly generate, carry, nurse and educate their children, will they\r\nin deed and in truth carry out the holy and happy purpose of their\r\nCreator. See those miserable and depraved scape-goats of humanity,\r\nthe demented simpletons, the half-crazy, unbalanced multitudes\r\nwhich infest our earth, and fill our prisons with criminals and\r\nour poor-houses with paupers. Oh! the boundless capabilities and\r\nperfections of our God-like nature and, alas! its deformities! All\r\nis the result of the ignorance or indifference of parents. As long as\r\nchildren are the accidents of lust instead of the premeditated objects\r\nof love, so long will the offspring deteriorate and the world be\r\ncursed with deformities, monstrosities, unhumanities and cranks.\r\n\r\n2. EACH AFTER ITS KIND.--\"Like parents like children.\" \"In their own\r\nimage beget\" they them. In what other can they? \"How can a corrupt\r\ntree bring forth good fruit?\" How can animal propensities in parents\r\ngenerate other than depraved children, or moral purity beget beings\r\nother than as holy by nature as those at whose hands they received\r\nexistence and constitution?\r\n\r\n3. AS ARE THE PARENTS, physically, mentally and morally when they\r\nstamp their own image and likeness upon progeny, so will be the\r\nconstitution of that progeny.\r\n\r\n4. \"JUST AS THE TWIG IS BENT THE TREE'S INCLINED.\"--Yet the bramble\r\ncannot be bent to bear delicious peaches, nor the sycamore to bear\r\ngrain. Education is something, _but parentage_ is _everything_;\r\nbecause it \"_dyes in the wool_\" and thereby exerts an influence on\r\ncharacter almost infinitely more powerful than all other conditions\r\nput together.\r\n\r\n5. HEALTHY AND BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN.--Thoughtless mortal! Before\r\nyou allow the first goings forth of love, learn what the parental\r\nconditions in you mean, and you will confer a great boon upon the\r\nprospective bone of your bone, and flesh of your flesh! If it is in\r\nyour power to be the parent of beautiful, healthy, moral and talented\r\nchildren instead of diseased and depraved, is it not your imperious\r\nduty then, to impart to them that physical power, moral perfection,\r\nand intellectual capability, which shall ennoble their lives and make\r\nthem good people and good citizens?\r\n\r\n6. PAUSE AND TREMBLE.--Prospective parents! Will you trifle with\r\nthe dearest interests of your children? Will you in matters thus\r\nmomentous, head-long rush\r\n\r\n  \"Where angels dare not tread,\"\r\n\r\nSeeking only mere animal indulgence?--Well might cherubim shrink from\r\nassuming responsibilities thus momentous Yet, how many parents tread\r\nthis holy ground completely unprepared, and almost as thoughtlessly\r\nand Ignorantly as brutes--entailing even loathsome diseases and\r\nsensual propensities upon the fruit of their own bodies. Whereas they\r\nare bound, by obligations the most imperious to bestow on them a\r\ngood physical organization, along with a pure, moral, and strong\r\nintellectual constitution, or else not to become parents! Especially\r\nsince it is easier to generate human angels than devils incarnate.\r\n\r\n7. HEREDITARY DESCENT.--This great law of things, \"Hereditary\r\nDescent,\" fully proves and illustrates in any required number and\r\nvariety or cases, showing that progeny inherits the constitutional\r\nnatures and characters, mental and physical, of parents, including\r\npre-dispositions to consumption, insanity, all sorts of disease,\r\netc., as well as longevity, strength, stature, looks, disposition,\r\ntalents,--all that is constitutional. From what other source do or can\r\nthey come? Indeed, who can doubt a truth as palpable as that children\r\ninherit some, and if some, therefore all, the physical and mental\r\nnature and constitutor of parents, thus becoming almost their\r\nfac-similes?\r\n\r\n8. ILLUSTRATIONS.--A whaleman was severely hurt by a harpooned and\r\ndesperate whale turning upon the small boat, and, by his monstrous\r\njaws, smashing it to pieces, one of which, striking him in his right\r\nside, crippled him for life. When sufficiently recovered, he married,\r\naccording to previous engagement, and his daughter, born in due time,\r\nand closely resembling him in looks, constitution and character, has a\r\nweak and sore place corresponding in location with that of the injury\r\nof her father. Tubercles have been found in the lungs of infants at\r\nbirth, born of consumptive parents,--a proof, clear and demonstrative,\r\nthat children inherit the several states of parental physiology\r\nexisting at the time they received their physiological constitution.\r\nThe same is true of the transmission of those diseases consequent\r\non the violation of the law of chastity, and the same conclusion\r\nestablished thereby.\r\n\r\n9. PARENT'S PARTICIPATION.--Each parent furnishing at indispensable\r\nportion of the materials of life, and somehow or other, contributes\r\nparentally to the formation of the constitutional character of their\r\njoint product, appears far more reasonable, than to ascribe, as many\r\ndo, the whole to either some to paternity, others to maternity. Still\r\nthis decision go which way it may, does not affect the great fact that\r\nchildren inherit both the physiology and the mentality existing in\r\nparents at the time they received being and constitution.\r\n\r\n10. ILLEGITIMATES OR BASTARDS also furnish strong proof of the\r\ncorrectness of this our leading doctrine. They are generally lively,\r\nsprightly, witty, frolicksome, knowing, quiet of perception, apt to\r\nlearn, full of passion, quick-tempered, impulsive throughout, hasty,\r\nindiscreet, given to excesses, yet abound in good feeling, and are\r\nwell calculated to enjoy life, though in general sadly deficient in\r\nsome essential moral elements.\r\n\r\n11. CHARACTER OF ILLEGITIMATES.--Wherein, then, consists this\r\ndifference? First, in \"novelty lending an enchantment\" rarely\r\nexperienced in sated wedlock, as well as in, power of passion\r\nsufficient to break through all restraint, external and internal; and\r\nhence their high wrought organization. They are usually wary and on\r\nthe alert, and their parents drank \"stolen waters.\" They are commonly\r\nwanting in moral balance, or else delinquent in some important moral\r\naspect; nor would they have ever been born unless this had been the\r\ncase, for the time being at least with their parents. Behold in these,\r\nand many other respects easily cited, how striking the coincidence\r\nbetween their characters on the one hand, and, on the other, those\r\nparental conditions necessarily attendant on their origin.\r\n\r\n12. CHILDREN'S CONDITION depends upon parents' condition at the time\r\nof the sexual embrace. Let parents recall, as nearly as may be their\r\ncircumstances and states of body and mind at this period, and place\r\nthem by the side of the physical and mental constitutions of their\r\nchildren, and then say whether this law is not a great practical\r\ntruth, and if so, its importance is as the happiness and misery it is\r\ncapable of affecting! The application of this mighty engine of good or\r\nevil to mankind, to the promotion of human advancement, is the great\r\nquestion which should profoundly interest all parents.\r\n\r\n13. THE VITAL PERIOD.--The physical condition of parents at the vital\r\nperiod of transmission of life should be a perfect condition of health\r\nin both body and mind, and a vigorous condition of all the animal\r\norgans and functions.\r\n\r\n14. MUSCULAR PREPARATION.--Especially should parents cultivate their\r\nmuscular system preparatory to the perfection of this function, and of\r\ntheir children; because, to impart strength and stamina to offspring\r\nthey must of necessity both possess a good muscular organization,\r\nand also bring it into vigorous requisition at this period. For this\r\nreason, if for no other, let those of sedentary habits cultivate\r\nmuscular energy preparatory to this time of need.\r\n\r\n15. THE SEED.--So exceedingly delicate are the seeds of life, that,\r\nunless planted in a place of perfect security, they must all be\r\ndestroyed and our race itself extinguished. And what place is as\r\nsecure as that chosen, where they can be reached only with the utmost\r\ndifficulty, and than only as the peril of even life itself? Imperfect\r\nseed sown in poor ground means a sickly harvest.\r\n\r\n16. HEALTHY PEOPLE--MOST CHILDREN.--The most healthy classes have\r\nthe most numerous families; but that, as luxury enervates society, it\r\ndiminishes the population, by enfeebling parents, nature preferring\r\nnone rather than those too weakly to live and be happy, and thereby\r\nrendering that union unfruitful which is too feeble to produce\r\noffspring sufficiently strong to enjoy life. Debility and disease\r\noften cause barrenness. Nature seems to rebel against sickly\r\noffspring.\r\n\r\n17. WHY CHILDREN DIE.--Inquire whether one or both the parents of\r\nthose numerous children that die around us, have not weak lungs, or a\r\ndebilitated stomach, or a diseased liver, or feeble muscles, or else\r\nuse them but little, or disordered nerves, or some other debility or\r\nform of disease. The prevalence of summer complaints, colic, cholera\r\ninfantum, and other affections of these vital organs of children is\r\ntruly alarming, sweeping them into their graves by the million.\r\nShall other animals rear nearly all their young, and shall man,\r\nconstitutionally by far the strongest of them all, lose half or more\r\nof his? is this the order of nature? No, but their death-worm is born\r\nin and with them, and by parental agency.\r\n\r\n18. GRAVE-YARD STATISTICS.--Take grave-yard statistics in August, and\r\nthen say, whether most of the deaths of children are not caused by\r\nindigestion, or feebleness of the bowels, liver, etc., or\r\ncomplaints growing out of them? Rather, take family statistics from\r\nbroken-hearted parents! And yet, in general, those very parents\r\nwho thus suffer more than words can tell, were the first and main\r\ntransgressors, because they entailed those dyspeptic, heart, and other\r\nkindred affections so common among American parents upon their own\r\nchildren, and thereby almost as bad as killed them by inches; thus\r\ndepriving them of the joys of life, and themselves of their greatest\r\nearthly treasure!\r\n\r\n19. ALL CHILDREN MAY DIE.--Children may indeed die whose parents are\r\nhealthy, but they almost must whose parents are essentially ailing in\r\none or more of their vital organs; because, since they inherit this\r\norgan debilitated or diseased, any additional cause of sickness\r\nattacks this part first, and when it gives out, all go by the board\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n20. PARENTS MUST LEARN AND OBEY.--How infinitely more virtuous and\r\nhappy would your children be if you should be healthy in body, and\r\nhappy in mind, so as to beget in them a constitutionally healthy and\r\nvigorous physiology, along with a serene and happy frame of mind!\r\nWords are utterly powerless in answer, and so is everything but a\r\nlifetime of consequent happiness or misery! Learn and obey, then,\r\nthe laws of life and health, that you may both reap the rich reward\r\nyourself, and also shower down upon your children after you, blessings\r\nmany and most exalted. Avoid excesses of all kinds, be temperate,\r\ntake good care of the body and avoid exposures and disease, and your\r\nchildren will be models of health and beauty.\r\n\r\n21. THE RIGHT CONDITION.--The great practical inference is, that those\r\nparents who desire intellectual and moral children, must love each\r\nother; because, this love, besides perpetually calling forth and\r\ncultivating their higher faculties, awakens them to the highest pitch\r\nof exalted action in that climax, concentration, and consummation of\r\nlove which propagates their existing qualities, the mental endowment\r\nof offspring being proportionate to the purity and intensity of\r\nparental love.\r\n\r\n22. THE EFFECTS.--The children of affectionate parents receive\r\nexistence and constitution when love has rendered the mentality of\r\ntheir parents both more elevated and more active than it is by nature,\r\nof course the children of loving parents are both more intellectual\r\nand moral by nature than their parents. Now, if these children and\r\ntheir companions also love one another, this same law which renders\r\nthe second generation better than the first, will of course render\r\nthe third still better than the second, and thus of all succeeding\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\n23. ANIMAL IMPULSE.--You may preach and pray till doomsday--may\r\nsend out missionaries, may circulate tracts and Bibles, and multiply\r\nrevivals and all the means of grace, with little avail; because, as\r\nlong as mankind go on, as now, to propagate by animal impulse, so long\r\nmust their offspring be animal, sensual, devilish! But only induce\r\nparents cordially to love each other, and you thereby render their\r\nchildren constitutionally talented and virtuous. Oh! parents, by as\r\nmuch as you prefer the luxuries of concord to the torments of discord,\r\nand children that are sweet dispositioned and highly intellectual to\r\nthose that are rough wrathful, and depraved, be entreated to \"_love\r\none another_.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUST HOME FROM SCHOOL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTOO MANY CHILDREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. LESSENING PAUPERISM.--Many of the agencies for lessening pauperism\r\nare afraid of tracing back its growth to the frequency of births under\r\nwretched conditions. One begins to question whether after all sweet\r\ncharity or dignified philanthropy has not acted with an unwise\r\nreticence. Among the problems which defy practical handling this is\r\nthe most complicated. The pauperism which arises from marriage is the\r\nresult of the worst elements of character legalized. In America,\r\nwhere the boundaries of wedlock are practically boundless, it is\r\nnot desirable, even were it possible, that the state should regulate\r\nmarriage much further than it now does; therefore must the sociologist\r\nturn for aid to society in his struggle with pauperism.\r\n\r\n2. RIGHT PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL CONDITIONS OF BIRTH.--Society should\r\ninsist upon the right spiritual and physical conditions for birth.\r\nIt should be considered more than \"a pity\" when another child is born\r\ninto a home too poor to receive it. The underlying selfishness of such\r\nan event should be recognized, for it brings motherhood under wrong\r\nconditions of health and money. Instead of each birth being the result\r\nof mature consideration and hallowed loves children are too often born\r\nas animals are born. To be sure the child has a father whom he can\r\ncall by name. Better that there had never been a child.\r\n\r\n3. WRONG RESULTS.--No one hesitates to declare that if is want of\r\nself-respect and morality which brings wrong results outside of\r\nmarriage, but it is also the want of them which begets evil inside the\r\nmarriage relation. Though there is nothing more difficult than to\r\nfind the equilibrium between self-respect and self-sacrifice, yet on\r\nsuccess in finding it depends individual and national preservation.\r\nThe fact of being wife and mother or husband and father should imply\r\ndignity and joyousness, no matter how humble the home.\r\n\r\n4. DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AMONGST PHYSICIANS.--In regard to teaching,\r\nthe difficulties are great. As soon as one advances beyond the\r\nsimplest subjects of hygiene, one is met with the difference of\r\nopinions among physicians. When each one has a different way of making\r\na mustard plaster, no wonder that each has his own notions about\r\neverything else. One doctor recommends frequent births, another\r\nadvises against them.\r\n\r\n5. DIFFERENT NATURES.--If physiological facts are taught to a large\r\nclass, there are sure to be some in it whose impressionable natures\r\nare excited by too much plain speaking, while there are others who\r\nneed the most open teaching in order to gain any benefit. Talks to a\r\nfew persons generally are wiser than popular lectures. Especially are\r\ntalks needed by mothers and unmothered girls who come from everywhere\r\nto the city.\r\n\r\n6. BOYS AND YOUNG MEN.--It is not women alone who require the shelter\r\nof organizations and instruction, but boys and young men. There is\r\nno double standard of morality, though the methods of advocating it\r\ndepend upon the sex which is to be instructed. Men are more concerned\r\nwith the practical basis of morality than with its sentiment, and\r\nwith the pecuniary aspects of domestic life than with its physical\r\nand mental suffering. We all may need medicine for moral ills, yet the\r\nvery intangibleness of purity makes us slow to formulate rules for its\r\ngrowth. Under the guidance of the wise in spirit and knowledge, much\r\ncan be done to create a higher standard of marriage and to proportion\r\nthe number of births according to the health and income of parents.\r\n\r\n7. FOR THE SAKE OF THE STATE.--If the home exists primarily for the\r\nsake of the individual, it exists secondarily for the sake of the\r\nstate. Therefore, any home into which are continually born the\r\ninefficient children of inefficient parents, not only is a discomfort\r\nin itself, but it also furnishes members for the armies of the\r\nunemployed, which are tinkering and hindering legislation and\r\ndemanding by the brute force of numbers that the state shall support\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n8. OPINIONS FROM HIGH AUTHORITIES.--In the statements and arguments\r\nmade in the above we have not relied upon our own opinions and\r\nconvictions, but have consulted the best authorities, and we hereby\r\nquote some of the highest authorities upon this subject.\r\n\r\n9. REV. LEONARD DAWSON.--\"How rapidly conjugal prudence might lift a\r\nnation out of pauperism was seen in France.--Let them therefore\r\nhold the maxim that the production of offspring with forethought and\r\nprovidence is rational nature. It was immoral to bring children into\r\nthe world whom they could not reasonably hope to feed, clothe and\r\neducate.\"\r\n\r\n10. MRS. FAWCETT.--\"Nothing will permanently offset pauperism while\r\nthe present reckless increase of population continues.\"\r\n\r\n11. DR. GEORGE NAPHEYS.--\"Having too many children unquestionably has\r\nits disastrous effects on both mother and children as known to every\r\nintelligent physician. Two-thirds of all cases of womb disease, says\r\nDr. Tilt, are traceable to child-bearing in feeble women. There are\r\nalso women to whom pregnancy is a nine months' torture, and others to\r\nwhom it is nearly certain to prove fatal. Such a condition cannot\r\nbe discovered before marriage--The detestable crime of abortion is\r\nappallingly rife in our day. It is abroad in our land to an extent\r\nwhich would have shocked the dissolute women of pagan RomeS--This\r\nwholesale, fashionable murder, how are we to stop it? Hundreds of vile\r\nmen and women in our large cities subsist by this slaughter of the\r\ninnocent.\"\r\n\r\n12. REV. H.R. HAWEIS.--\"Until it is thought a disgrace in every rank\r\nof society, from top to bottom of social scale, to bring into the\r\nworld more children than you are able to provide for, the poor man's\r\nhome, at least, must often be a purgatory--his children dinnerless,\r\nhis wife a beggar--himself too often drunk--here, then, are the real\r\nremedies: first, control the family growth according to the family\r\nmeans of support.\"\r\n\r\n13. MONTAGUE COOKSON.--\"The limitation of the number of the family--is\r\nas much the duty of married persons as the observance of chastity is\r\nthe duty of those that are unmarried.\"\r\n\r\n14. JOHN STUART MILL.--\"Every one has aright to live. We will suppose\r\nthis granted. But no one has a right to bring children into life to\r\nbe supported by other people. Whoever means to stand upon the first\r\nof these rights must renounce all pretension to the last. Little\r\nimprovement can be expected in morality until the production of a\r\nlarge family is regarded in the same light as drunkenness or any other\r\nphysical excess.\"\r\n\r\n15. DR. T.D. NICHOLLS.--\"In the present social state, men and women\r\nshould refrain from having children unless they see a reasonable\r\nprospect of giving them suitable nurture and education.\"\r\n\r\n16. REV. M.J. SAVAGE.--\"Some means ought to be provided for checking\r\nthe birth of sickly children.\"\r\n\r\n17. DR. STOCKHAM.--\"Thoughtful minds must acknowledge the great wrong\r\ndone when children are begotten under adverse conditions. Women must\r\nlearn the laws of life so as to protect themselves, and not be the\r\nmeans of bringing sin-cursed, diseased children into the world. The\r\nremedy is in the prevention of pregnancy, not in producing abortion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSMALL FAMILIES AND THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE RACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. MARRIED PEOPLE MUST DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES.--It is the fashion of\r\nthose who marry nowadays to have few children, often none. Of course\r\nthis is a matter which married people must decide for themselves. As\r\nis stated in an earlier chapter, sometimes this policy is the wisest\r\nthat can be pursued.\r\n\r\n2. Diseased people who are likely to beget only a sickly offspring,\r\nmay follow this course, and so may thieves, rascals, vagabonds, insane\r\nand drunken persons, and all those who are likely to bring into the\r\nworld beings that ought not to be here. But why so many well-to-do\r\nfolks should pursue a policy adapted only to paupers and criminals,\r\nis not easy to explain. Why marry at all if not to found a family that\r\nshall live to bless and make glad the earth after father and mother\r\nare gone? It is not wise to rear too many children, nor is it wise to\r\nhave too few. Properly brought up, they will make home a delight, and\r\nparents happy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A WELL NOURISHED CHILD.]\r\n\r\n3. POPULATION LIMITED.--Galton, in his great work on hereditary\r\ngenius, observes that \"the time may hereafter arrive in far distant\r\nyears, when the population of this earth shall be kept as strictly\r\nwithin bounds of number and suitability of race, as the sheep of a\r\nwell-ordered moor, or the plants in an orchard-house; in the meantime\r\nlet us do what we can to encourage the multiplication of the\r\nraces best fitted to invent and conform to a high and generous\r\ncivilization.\"\r\n\r\n4. SHALL SICKLY PEOPLE RAISE CHILDREN?--The question whether sickly\r\npeople should marry and propagate their kind, is briefly alluded to\r\nin an early chapter of this work. Where father and mother are both\r\nconsumptive the chances are that the children will inherit physical\r\nweakness, which will result in the same disease, unless great pains\r\nare taken to give them a good physical education, and even then the\r\nprobabilities are that they will find life a burden hardly worth\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n5. NO REAL BLESSING.--Where one parent is consumptive and the other\r\nvigorous, the chances are just half as great. If there is a scrofulous\r\nor consumptive taint in the blood, beware! Sickly children are no\r\ncomfort to their parents, no real blessing. If such people marry, they\r\nhad better, in most cases, avoid parentage.\r\n\r\n6. WELFARE OF MANKIND.--The advancement of the welfare of mankind is a\r\nmost intricate problem: all ought to refrain from marriage who cannot\r\navoid abject poverty for their children; for poverty is not only a\r\ngreat evil, but tends to its own increase by leading to recklessness\r\nin marriage. On the other hand, as Mr. Galton has remarked, if the\r\nprudent avoid marriage, while the reckless marry, the inferior members\r\nwill tend to supplant the better members of society.\r\n\r\n7. PREVENTIVES.--Remember that the thousands of preventives which\r\nare advertised in papers, private circulars, etc., are not only\r\ninefficient, unreliable and worthless, but positively dangerous, and\r\nthe annual mortality of females in this country from this cause alone\r\nis truly horrifying. Study nature, and nature's laws alone will guide\r\nyou safely in the path of health and happiness.\r\n\r\n8. NATURE'S REMEDY.--Nature in her wise economy has prepared for\r\noverproduction, for during the period of pregnancy and nursing, and\r\nalso most of the last half of each menstrual month, woman is naturally\r\nsterile; but this condition may become irregular and uncertain on\r\naccount of stimulating drinks or immoral excesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE GENERATIVE ORGANS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MALE GENERATIVE ORGANS AND THEIR STRUCTURE AND\r\nADAPTATION.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The reproductive organs in man are the penis and testicles and\r\ntheir appendages.\r\n\r\n2. The penis deposits the seminal life germ of the male. It is\r\ndesigned to fulfill the seed planting mission of human life.\r\n\r\n3. In the accompanying illustration all the parts are named.\r\n\r\n4. URETHRA.--The urethra performs the important mission of emptying\r\nthe bladder, and is rendered very much larger by the passion, and the\r\nsemen is propelled along through it by little layers of muscles on\r\neach side meeting above and below. It is this canal that is inflamed\r\nby the disease known as gonorrhoea.\r\n\r\n5. PROSTATE GLAND.--The prostate gland is located just before the\r\nbladder. It swells in men who have previously overtaxed it, thus\r\npreventing all sexual intercourse, and becomes very troublesome to\r\nvoid urine. This is a very common trouble in old age.\r\n\r\n6. THE PENAL GLAND.--The penal gland, located at the end of the penis,\r\nbecomes unduly enlarged by excessive action and has the consistency of\r\nIndia rubber. It is always enlarged by erection. It is this gland at\r\nthe end that draws the semen forward. It is one of the most essential\r\nand wonderful constructed glands of the human body.\r\n\r\n7. FEMALE MAGNETISM.--When the male organ comes in contact with female\r\nmagnetism, the natural and proper excitement takes place. When excited\r\nwithout this female magnetism it becomes one of the most serious\r\ninjuries to the human body. The male organ was made for a high and\r\nholy purpose, and woe be to him who pollutes his manhood by practicing\r\nthe secret vice. He pays the penalty in after years either by the\r\nentire loss of sexual power, or by the afflictions of various urinary\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\n8. NATURE PAYS all her debts, and when there is an abuse of organ,\r\npenalties must follow. If the hand is thrust into the fire it will be\r\nburnt.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE FEMALE SEXUAL ORGANS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The generative or reproductive organs of the human female are\r\nusually divided into the internal and external. Those regarded as\r\ninternal are concealed from view and protected within the body. Those\r\nthat can be readily perceived are termed external. The entrance of the\r\nvagina may be stated as the line of demarcation of the two divisions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANATOMY OR STRUCTURE OF THE FEMALE ORGANS OF\r\nGENERATION.]\r\n\r\n2. HYMEN OR VAGINAL VALVE.--This is a thin membrane of half moon shape\r\nstretched across the opening of the vagina. It usually contains before\r\nmarriage one or more small openings for the passage of the menses.\r\nThis membrane has been known to cause much distress in many females at\r\nthe first menstrual flow. The trouble resulting from the openings\r\nin the hymen not being large enough to let the flow through and\r\nconsequently blocking up the vaginal canal, and filling the entire\r\ninternal sexual organs with blood; causing paroxysms and hysterics and\r\nother alarming symptoms. In such cases the hymen must be ruptured that\r\na proper discharge may take place at once.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Impregnated Egg. In the first formation of Embryo.]\r\n\r\n3. UNYIELDING HYMEN.--The hymen is usually ruptured by the first\r\nsexual intercourse, but sometimes it is so unyielding as to require\r\nthe aid of a knife before coition can take place.\r\n\r\n4. THE PRESENCE OF THE HYMEN was formerly considered a test of\r\nvirginity, but this theory is no longer held by competent authorities,\r\nas disease or accidents or other circumstances may cause its rupture.\r\n\r\n5. THE OVARIES.--The ovaries are little glands for the purpose of\r\nforming the female ova or egg. They are not fully developed until the\r\nperiod of puberty, and usually are about the size of a large chestnut.\r\nThe are located in the broad ligaments between the uterus and the\r\nFallopian tubes. During pregnancy the ovaries change position; they\r\nare brought farther into the abdominal cavity as the uterus expands.\r\n\r\n6. OFFICE OF THE OVARY.--The ovary is to the female what the testicle\r\nis to the male. It is the germ vitalizing organ and the most essential\r\npart of the generative apparatus. The ovary is not only an organ for\r\nthe formation of the ova, but is also designed for their separation\r\nwhen they reach maturity.\r\n\r\n7. FALLOPION TUBES.--These are the ducts that lead from the ovaries to\r\nthe uterus. They are entirely detached from the glands or ovaries, and\r\nare developed on both sides of the body.\r\n\r\n8. OFFICE OF THE FALLOPIAN TUBES.--The Fallopian tubes have a double\r\noffice: receiving the ova from the ovaries and conducting it into\r\nthe uterus, as well as receiving the spermatic fluid of the male and\r\nconveying it from the uterus in the direction of the ovaries, the\r\ntubes being the seat of impregnation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OVUM.]\r\n\r\n9. STERILITY IN FEMALES.--Sterility in the female is sometimes caused\r\nby a morbid adhesion of the tube to a portion of the ovary. By what\r\npower the mouth of the tube is directed toward a particular portion\r\nof an ovary, from which the ovum is about to be discharged, remains\r\nentirely unknown, as does also the precise nature of the cause which\r\neffects this movement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ripe Ovum from the Ovary.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTERIES OF THE FORMATION OF LIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. SCIENTIFIC THEORIES.--Darwin, Huxley, Haeckel, Tyndall, Meyer,\r\nand other renowned scientists, have tried to find the _missing link_\r\nbetween man and animal; they have also exhausted their genius in\r\ntrying to fathom the mysteries of the beginning of life, or find where\r\nthe animal and mineral kingdoms unite to form life; but they have\r\nadded to the vast accumulation of theories only, and the world is but\r\nlittle wiser on this mysterious subject.\r\n\r\n2. PHYSIOLOGY.--Physiology has demonstrated what physiological changes\r\ntake place in the germination and formation of life, and how nature\r\nexpresses the intentions of reproduction by giving animals distinctive\r\norgans with certain secretions for this purpose, etc. All the\r\ndifferent stages of development can be easily determined, but how and\r\nwhy life takes place under such special condition and under no other,\r\nis an unsolved mystery.\r\n\r\n3. OVARIES.--The ovaries are the essential parts of the generative\r\nsystem of the human female in which ova are matured. There are two\r\novaries, one on each side of the uterus, and connected with it by the\r\nFallopian tubes. They are egg-shaped, about an inch in diameter, and\r\nfurnish the germs or ovules. These germs or ovules are very small,\r\nmeasuring about 1/120 of an inch in diameter.\r\n\r\n4. DEVELOPMENT.--The ovaries develop with the growth of the female, so\r\nthat finally at the period of puberty they ripen and liberate an\r\novum or germ vesicle, which is carried into the uterine cavity of the\r\nFallopian tubes. By the aid of the microscope we find that these ova\r\nare composed of granular substance, in which is found a miniature yolk\r\nsurrounded by a transparent membrane called the zona pellucida. This\r\nyolk contains a germinal vesicle in which can be discovered a nucleus,\r\ncalled the germinal spot. The process of the growth of the ovaries is\r\nvery gradual, and their function of ripening and discharging one ovum\r\nmonthly into the Fallopian tubes and uterus, is not completed until\r\nbetween the twelfth and fifteenth years.\r\n\r\n5. WHAT SCIENCE KNOWS.--After the sexual embrace we know that the\r\nsperm is lifted within the genital passages or portion of the vagina\r\nand mouth of the uterus. The time between the deposit of the semen\r\nand fecundation varies according to circumstances. If the sperm-cell\r\ntravels to the ovarium it generally takes from three to five days to\r\nmake the journey. As Dr. Pierce says: The transportation is aided\r\nby the ciliary processes (little hairs) of the mucous surface of the\r\nvaginal and uterine walls, as well as by its own vibratile movements.\r\nThe action of the cilia, under the stimulus of the sperm, seems to be\r\nfrom without, inward. Even if a minute particle of sperm, less than a\r\ndrop, be left upon the margin of the external genitals of the female,\r\nit is sufficient in amount to impregnate, and can be carried, by help\r\nof these cilia, to the ovaries.\r\n\r\n6. CONCEPTION.--After intercourse at the proper time the liability to\r\nconception is very great. If the organs are in a healthy condition,\r\nconception must necessarily follow, and no amount of prudence and the\r\nmost rigid precautions often fail to prevent pregnancy.\r\n\r\n7. ONLY ONE ABSOLUTELY SAFE METHOD.--There is only one absolutely safe\r\nmethod to prevent conception, entirely free from danger and injury to\r\nhealth, and one that is in the reach of all; that is to refrain from\r\nunion altogether.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A EUGENIC BABY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCONCEPTION--ITS LIMITATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A COMMON QUESTION.--The question is often asked, \"Can Conception\r\nbe prevented at all times?\" Let us say right here that even if such an\r\ninterference with nature's laws were possible it is inadmissible, and\r\nnever to be justified except in cases of deformity or disease.\r\n\r\n2. FALSE CLAIMS OF IMPOSTERS.--During the past few years a great deal\r\nhas been written on the subject, claiming that new remedies had been\r\ndiscovered for the prevention of conception, etc., but these are all\r\nmoney making devices to deceive the public, and enrich the pockets of\r\nmiserable and unprincipled imposters.\r\n\r\n3. THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER.--Dr. Pancoast, an eminent authority,\r\nsays: \"The truth is, there is no medicine taken internally capable of\r\npreventing conception, and the person who asserts to the contrary, not\r\nonly speaks falsely, but is both a knave and a fool.\"\r\n\r\n4. FOOLISH DREAD OF CHILDREN.--What is more deplorable and pitiable\r\nthan an old couple childless? Young people dislike the care and\r\nconfinement of children and prefer society and social entertainments\r\nand thereby do great injustice and injury to their health. Having\r\nchildren under proper circumstances never ruins the health and\r\nhappiness of any woman. In fact, womanhood is incomplete without them.\r\nShe may have a dozen or more, and still have better health than before\r\nmarriage. It is having them too close together, and when she is not in\r\na fit state, that her health gives way.\r\n\r\n5. SELF-DENIAL AND FORBEARANCE.--If the husband respects his wife he\r\nwill come to her relief by exercising self-denial and forbearance, but\r\nsometimes before the mother has recovered from the effects of bearing,\r\nnursing and rearing one child, ere she has regained proper tone and\r\nvigor of body and mind, she is unexpectedly overtaken, surprised by\r\nthe manifestation of symptoms which again indicate pregnancy. Children\r\nthus begotten cannot become hardy and long-lived. But the love that\r\nparents may feel for their posterity, by the wishes for their success,\r\nby the hopes for their usefulness, by every consideration for their\r\nfuture well-being, let them exercise caution and forbearance until\r\nthe wife becomes sufficiently healthy and enduring to bequeath her own\r\nrugged, vital stamina to the child she bears in love.\r\n\r\n6. A WRONG TO THE MOTHER AND CHILD.--Sometimes the mother is diseased;\r\nthe outlet from the womb, as a result of laceration by a previous\r\nchild-birth, is frequently enlarged, thus allowing conception to take\r\nplace very readily, and hence she has children in rapid succession.\r\nBesides the wrong to the mother in having children in such rapid\r\nsuccession, it is a great injustice to the babe in the womb and the\r\none at the breast that they should follow each other so quickly that\r\none is conceived while the other is nursing. One takes the vitality of\r\nthe other; neither has sufficient nourishment, and both are started in\r\nlife stunted and incomplete.\r\n\r\n7. FEEBLE AND DISEASED PARENTS.--If the parties of a marriage are both\r\nfeeble and so adapted to each other that their children are deformed,\r\ninsane or idiots, then to beget offspring would be a flagrant wrong;\r\nif the mother's health is in such a condition as to forbid the right\r\nof laying the burden of motherhood upon her, then medical aid may\r\nsafely come to her relief.\r\n\r\n8. \"THE DESIRABILITY AND PRACTICABILITY of limiting offspring,\" says\r\nDr. Stockham, are the subject of frequent inquiry. Fewer and better\r\nchildren are desired by right-minded parents. Many men and women, wise\r\nin other things of the world, permit generation as a chance result\r\nof copulation, without thought of physical or mental conditions to\r\nbe transmitted to the child. Coition, the one important act of all\r\nothers, carrying with it the most vital results, is usually committed\r\nfor selfish gratification. Many a drunkard owes his lifelong appetite\r\nfor alcohol to the fact that the inception of his life could be\r\ntraced to a night of dissipation on the part of his father. Physical\r\ndegeneracy and mental derangements are too often caused by the parents\r\nproducing offspring while laboring under great mental strain or bodily\r\nfatigue. Drunkenness and licentiousness are frequently the heritage of\r\nposterity. Future generations demand that such results be averted by\r\nbetter prenatal influences. The world is groaning under the curse of\r\nchance parenthood. It is due to posterity that procreation be brought\r\nunder the control of reason and conscience.\r\n\r\n9. \"IT HAS BEEN FEARED THAT A KNOWLEDGE of means to control offspring\r\nwould, if generally diffused, be abused by women; that they would\r\nto so great an extent escape motherhood as to bring about social\r\ndisaster. This fear is not well founded. The maternal instinct is\r\ninherent and sovereign in woman. Even the prenatal influences of a\r\nmurderous intent on the part of parents scarcely ever eradicate it.\r\nWith this natural desire for children, we believe few woman would\r\nabuse the knowledge of privilege of controlling offspring. Although\r\nwomen shrink from forced maternity, and from the bearing of children\r\nunder the great burden of suffering, as well as other adverse\r\nconditions, it is rare to find a woman who is not greatly disappointed\r\nif she does not, some time in her life, wear the crown of motherhood.\r\n\r\n\"An eminent lady teacher, in talking to her pupils once said, 'The\r\ngreatest calamity that can befall a woman is never to have a child.\r\nThe next greatest calamity is to have one only.' From my professional\r\nexperience I am happy to testify that more women seek to overcome\r\ncauses of sterility than to obtain knowledge of limiting the size of\r\nthe family or means to destroy the embryo. Also, if consultation for\r\nthe latter is sought, it is usually at the instigation of the husband.\r\nBelieving in the rights of unborn children, and in the maternal\r\ninstinct, I am consequently convinced that no knowledge should be\r\nwithheld that will secure proper conditions for the best parenthood.\"\r\n\r\n10. THE CASE OF THE JUKE FAMILY.--We submit the following case of the\r\nJuke family, mostly of New York state, as related by Dr. R.L. Dugdale,\r\nwhen a member of the prison Association, and let the reader judge for\r\nhimself:\r\n\r\n\"It was traced out by painstaking research that from one woman called\r\nMargaret, who, like Topsy, merely 'growed' without pedigree as a\r\npauper in a village of the upper Hudson, about eighty-five years ago,\r\nthere descended 673 children, grandchildren and great grandchildren,\r\nof whom 200 were criminals of the dangerous class, 280 adult\r\npaupers, and 50 prostitutes, while 300 children of her lineage died\r\nprematurely. The last fact proves to what extent in this family nature\r\nwas kind to the rest of humanity in saving it from a still larger\r\naggregation or undesirable and costly members, for it is estimated\r\nthat the expense to the State of the descendants of Maggie was over\r\na million dollars, and the State itself did something also towards\r\npreventing a greater expense by the restrain exercised upon the\r\ncriminals, paupers, and idiots of the family during a considerable\r\nportion of their lives.\"\r\n\r\n11. MODERATION.--Continence, self-control, a willingness to deny\r\nhimself--that is what is required from the husband. But a thousand\r\nvoices reach us from suffering women in all parts of the land that\r\nthis will not suffice; that men refuse thus to restrain themselves;\r\nthat it leads to a loss of domestic happiness and to illegal amour, or\r\nit is injurious physically and morally; that, in short, such advice is\r\nuseless because impracticable.\r\n\r\n12. NATURE'S METHOD.--To such we reply that nature herself has\r\nprovided to some extent, against overproduction. It is well known that\r\nwomen, when nursing, rarely become pregnant, and for this reason, if\r\nfor no other, women should nurse their own children, and continue the\r\nperiod until the child is at least nine months or a year old. However,\r\nthe nursing, if continued too long, weakens both the mother and the\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n13. ANOTHER PROVISION OF NATURE.--For a certain period between her\r\nmonthly illness, every woman is sterile. Conception may be avoided by\r\nrefraining from coition except for this particular number of days,\r\nand there will be no evasion of natural intercourse, no resort to\r\ndisgusting practices, and nothing degrading.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPRENATAL INFLUENCES.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. DEFINITION.--By prenatal influences we mean those temporary\r\noperations of the mind or physical conditions of the parents previous\r\nto birth, which stamp their impress upon the new life.\r\n\r\n2. THREE PERIODS.--We may consider this subject as one which naturally\r\ndivides itself into three periods: the preparation which precedes\r\nconception, the mental, moral and physical conditions at the time of\r\nconjunction, and the environment and condition of the mother during\r\nthe period of gestation.\r\n\r\n3. PROMINENT AUTHORITIES.--A.E. Newton says: \"Numerous facts indicate\r\nthat offspring may be affected and their tendencies shaped by a great\r\nvariety of influences, among which moods and influences more or less\r\ntransient may be included.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Stall says: \"Prenatal influences are both subtle and potent, and\r\nno amount of wealth or learning or influence can secure exemption from\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nDr. John Cowan says upon this subject: \"The fundamental principles of\r\ngenius in reproduction are that, through the rightly directed wills\r\nof the father and mother, preceding and during antenatal life, the\r\nchild's form or body, character of mind and purity of soul are formed\r\nand established. That in its plastic state, during antenatal life,\r\nlike clay in the hands of the potter, it can be molded into absolutely\r\nany form of body and soul the parents may knowingly desire.\"\r\n\r\n4. LIKE PARENTS, LIKE CHILDREN.--It is folly to expect strong and\r\nvigorous children from weak and sickly parents, or virtuous offspring\r\nfrom impure ancestry.\r\n\r\nDr. James Foster Scott tells us that purity is, in fact, the crown of\r\nall real manliness; and the vigorous and robust, who by repression of\r\nevil have preserved their sexual potency, make the best husbands and\r\nfathers, and they are the direct benefactors for the race by begetting\r\nprogeny who are not predisposed to sexual vitiation and bodily and\r\nmental degeneracy.\r\n\r\n5. BLOOD WILL TELL.--Thus we see that prenatal influences greatly\r\nmodify, if they do not wholly control, inherited tendencies. Is it\r\ncommon sense to suppose that a child, begotten when the parents are\r\nexhausted from mental or physical overwork, can be as perfect as when\r\nthe parents are overflowing with the buoyancy of life and health? The\r\npractical farmer would not allow a domestic animal to come into his\r\nflock or herd under imperfect physical conditions. He understands that\r\nwhile \"blood will tell,\" the temporary conditions of the animals will\r\nalso tell in the perfections or imperfections of the offspring.\r\n\r\n6. HEALTH A LEGACY.--It is no small legacy to be endowed with perfect\r\nhealth. In begetting children comparatively few people seem to think\r\nthat any care of concern is necessary to insure against ill-health or\r\npoverty of mind. How strange our carelessness and unconcern when these\r\nare the groundwork of all comfort and success! How few faces and forms\r\nwe see which give sign of perfect health. It is just as reasonable to\r\nsuppose that men and women can squander their fortune and still have\r\nit left to bequeath to their children, as that parents can violate\r\norganic laws and still retain their own strength and activity.\r\n\r\n7. RESPONSIBILITY OF PARENTS.--Selden H. Tascott says: \"Ungoverned\r\npassions in the parents may unloose the furies of unrestrained madness\r\nin the minds of their children. Even untempered religious enthusiasm\r\nmay beget a fanaticism that can not be restrained within the limits of\r\nreason.\"\r\n\r\nIn view of the preceding statements, what a responsibility rests upon\r\nthe parents! No step in the process of parentage is unimportant. From\r\nthe lovers first thought of marriage to the birth of the child, every\r\nstep of the way should be paved with the snow-white blossoms of pure\r\nthought. Kindly words and deeds should bind the prospective parents\r\nmore closely together. Not mine and thine, but ours, should be the\r\nbond of sympathy. Each should be chaste in thought and word and deed\r\nas was Sir Galahad, who went in search of the Holy Grail, saying:\r\n\r\n  \"My strength is as the strength of ten,\r\n  Because my heart is pure.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR.

The above syringes are highly recommended by physicians as vaginal\r\ncleansers. They will be found a great relief in health or sickness,\r\nand in many cases cure barrenness or other diseases of the womb.\r\n\r\n2. CLEANLINESS.--Cleanliness is next to godliness. Without cleanliness\r\nthe human body is more or less defiled and repulsive. A hint to\r\nthe wise is sufficient. The vagina should be cleansed with the same\r\nfaithfulness as any other portion of the body.\r\n\r\n3. TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER.--Those not accustomed to use vaginal\r\ninjections would do well to use water milk-warm at the commencement;\r\nafter this the temperature may be varied according to circumstances.\r\nIn case of local inflammation use hot water. The indiscriminate use of\r\ncold water injections will be found rather injurious than beneficial,\r\nand a woman in feeble health will always find warm water invigorating\r\nand preferable.\r\n\r\n4. LEUCORRHOEA.--In case of persistent leucorrhoea use the temperature\r\nof water from seventy-two to eighty-five degrees Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\n5. THE CLEANSER will greatly stimulate the health and spirits of any\r\nwoman who uses it. Pure water injections have a stimulating effect,\r\nand it seems to invigorate the entire body.\r\n\r\n6. SALT AND WATER INJECTIONS.--This will cure mild cases of\r\nleucorrhoea. Add a teaspoonful of salt to a pint and a half of water\r\nat the proper temperature. Injections may be repeated daily if deemed\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n7. SOAP AND WATER.--Soap and water is a very simple domestic remedy,\r\nand will many times afford relief in many diseases of the womb. It\r\nseems it thoroughly cleanses the parts. A little borax or vinegar may\r\nbe used the same as salt water injections. (See No. 6.)\r\n\r\n8. HOLES IN THE TUBES.--Most of the holes in the tubes of syringes are\r\ntoo small. See that they are sufficiently large to produce thorough\r\ncleansing.\r\n\r\n9. INJECTIONS DURING THE MONTHLY FLOW.--Of course it is not proper to\r\narrest the flow, and the injections will stimulate a healthy action\r\nof the organs. The injections may be used daily throughout the monthly\r\nflow with much comfort and benefit. If the flow is scanty and painful\r\nthe injections may be as warm as they can be comfortably borne. If the\r\nflowing is immoderate, then cool water may be used. A woman will soon\r\nlearn her own condition and can act accordingly.\r\n\r\n10. BLOOM AND GRACE OF YOUTH.--The regular bathing of the body will\r\ngreatly improve woman's beauty. Remember that a perfect complexion\r\ndepends upon the healthy action of all the organs. Vaginal injections\r\nare just as important as the bath. A beautiful woman must not only\r\nbe cleanly, but robust and healthy. There can be no perfect beauty\r\nwithout good health.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Trying On a New Dress.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIMPOTENCE AND STERILITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Actual impotence during the period of manhood is a very rare\r\ncomplaint, and nature very unwillingly, and only after the absolute\r\nneglect of sanitary laws, gives up the power of reproduction.\r\n\r\n2. Not only sensual women, but all without exception, feel deeply\r\nhurt, and are repelled by the husband whom they may previously have\r\nloved dearly, when, after entering the married state, they find that\r\nhe is impotent. The more inexperienced and innocent they were at\r\nthe time of marriage, the longer it often is before they find that\r\nsomething is lacking in the husband; but, once knowing this, the wife\r\ninfallibly has a feeling of contempt and aversion for him though there\r\nare many happy families where this defect exists. It is often very\r\nuncertain who is the weak one, and no cause for separation should be\r\nsought.\r\n\r\n3. Unhappy marriages, barrenness, divorces, and perchance an\r\noccasional suicide, may be prevented by the experienced physician, who\r\ncan generally give correct information, comfort, and consolation, when\r\nconsulted on these delicate matters.\r\n\r\n4. When a single man fears that he is unable to fulfill the duties\r\nof marriage, he should not marry until his fear is dispelled. The\r\nsuspicion of such a fear strongly tends to bring about the very\r\nweakness which he dreads. Go to a good physician (not to one of those\r\nquacks whose advertisements you see in the papers; they are invariably\r\nunreliable), and state the case fully and freely.\r\n\r\n5. Diseases, malformation, etc., may cause impotence. In case of\r\nmalformation there is usually no remedy, but in case of disease it is\r\nusually within the reach of a skillful physician.\r\n\r\n6. Self-abuse and spermatorrhoea produce usually only temporary\r\nimpotence and can generally be relieved by carrying out the\r\ninstructions given elsewhere in this book.\r\n\r\n7. Excessive indulgences often enfeeble the powers and often result in\r\nimpotence. Dissipated single men, professional libertines, and married\r\nmen who are immoderate, often pay the penalty of their violations\r\nof the laws of nature, by losing their vital power. In such cases of\r\nexcess there may be some temporary relief, but as age advances the\r\neffects of such indiscretion will become more and more manifest.\r\n\r\n8. The condition of sterility in man may arise either from a condition\r\nof the secretion which deprives it of its fecundating powers or it may\r\nspring from a malformation which prevents it reaching the point where\r\nfecundation takes place. The former condition is most common in old\r\nage, and is a sequence of venereal disease, or from a change in the\r\nstructure or functions of the glands. The latter has its origin in a\r\nstricture, or in an injury, or in that condition technically known as\r\nhypospadias, or in debility.\r\n\r\n9. It can be safely said that neither self-indulgence nor\r\nspermatorrhoea often leads to permanent sterility.\r\n\r\n10. It is sometimes, however, possible, even where there is sterility\r\nin the male, providing the secretion is not entirely devoid of life\r\nproperties on part of the husband, to have children, but these are\r\nexceptions.\r\n\r\n11. No man need hesitate about matrimony on account of sterility,\r\nunless that condition arises from a permanent and absolute\r\ndegeneration of his functions.\r\n\r\n12. Impotence from mental and moral causes often takes place. Persons\r\nof highly nervous organization may suffer incapacity in their sexual\r\norgans. The remedy for these difficulties is rest and change of\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\n13. REMEDIES IN CASE OF IMPOTENCE ON ACCOUNT OF FORMER PRIVATE\r\nDISEASES, OR MASTURBATION, OR OTHER CAUSES.--First build up the body\r\nby taking some good stimulating tonics. The general health is the most\r\nessential feature to be considered, in order to secure restoration\r\nof the sexual powers. Constipation must be carefully avoided. If the\r\nkidneys do not work in good order, some remedy for their restoration\r\nmust be taken. Take plenty of out-door excercise avoid horseback\r\nriding or heavy exhaustive work.\r\n\r\n14. FOOD AND DRINKS WHICH WEAKEN DESIRE.--All kinds of food which\r\ncause dyspepsia or bring on constipation, diarrhea, or irritate the\r\nbowels, alcoholic beverages, or any indigestible compound, has the\r\ntendency to weaken the sexual power. Drunkards and tipplers suffer\r\nearly loss of vitality. Beer drinking has a tendency to irritate the\r\nstomach and to that extent affects the private organs.\r\n\r\n15. COFFEE.--Coffee drank excessively causes a debilitating effect\r\nupon the sexual organs. The moderate use of coffee can be recommended,\r\nyet an excessive habit of drinking very strong coffee will sometimes\r\nwholly destroy vitality.\r\n\r\n16. TOBACCO.--It is a hygienic and physiological fact that tobacco\r\nproduces sexual debility and those who suffer any weakness on that\r\nsource should carefully avoid the weed in all its forms.\r\n\r\n17. DRUGS WHICH STIMULATE DESIRE.--There are certain medicines which\r\nact locally on the membranes and organs of the male, and the papers\r\nare full of advertisements of \"Lost Manhood Restored\", etc., but in\r\nevery case they are worthless or dangerous drugs and certain to lead\r\nto some painful malady or death. All these patent medicines should be\r\ncarefully avoided. People who are troubled with any of these ailments\r\nshould not attempt to doctor themselves by taking drugs, but a\r\ncompetent physician should be consulted. Eating rye, corn, or graham\r\nbread, oatmeal, cracked wheat, plenty of fruit, etc. is a splendid\r\nmedicine. If that is not sufficient, then a physician should be\r\nconsulted.\r\n\r\n18. DRUGS WHICH MODERATE DESIRE.--Among one of the most common\r\ndomestic remedies is camphor. This has stood the test for ages. Small\r\ndoses or half a grain in most instances diminishes the sensibility\r\nof the organs of sex. In some cases it produces irritation of the\r\nbladder. In that case it should be at once discontinued. On the whole\r\na physician had better be consulted. The safest drug among domestic\r\nremedies is a strong tea made out of hops. Saltpeter, or nitrate of\r\npotash, taken in moderate quantities are very good remedies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n19. STRICTLY SPEAKING there is a distinction made between; _impotence_\r\nand _sterility._ _Impotence_ is a loss of power to engage in the\r\nsexual act and is common to men. It may be imperfection in the male\r\norgan or a lack of sufficient sexual vigor to produce and maintain\r\nerection. _Sterility_ is a total loss of capacity in the reproduction\r\nof the species, and is common to women.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, very few causes of barrenness that cannot be\r\nremoved when the patient is perfectly developed. Sterility, in a\r\nfemale, most frequently depends upon a weakness or irritability either\r\nin the ovaries or the womb, and anything having a strengthening effect\r\nupon either organ will remove the disability. (See page 249.)\r\n\r\n20. \"OVER-INDULGENCE in intercourse,\" says Dr. Hoff, \"is sometimes\r\nthe cause of barrenness; this is usually puzzling to the interested\r\nparties, inasmuch as the practices which, in their opinion, should be\r\nthe source of a numerous progeny, have the very opposite effect. By\r\ngreatly moderating their ardor, this defect may be remedied.\"\r\n\r\n21. \"NAPOLEON AND JOSEPHINE.--A certain adaptation between the male\r\nand female has been regarded as necessary to conception, consisting of\r\nsome mysterious influence which one sex exerts over the other, neither\r\none, however, being essentially impotent or sterile. The man may\r\nimpregnate one woman and not another, and the woman will conceive by\r\none man and not by another. In the marriage of Napoleon Bonaparte and\r\nJosephine no children were born, but after he had separated from the\r\nEmpress and wedded Maria Louisa of Austria, an heir soon came. Yet\r\nJosephine had children by Beauharnais, her previous husband. But as\r\nall is not known as to the physical condition of Josephine during her\r\nsecond marriage, it cannot be assumed that mere lack of adaptability\r\nwas the cause of unfruitfulness between them. There may have been\r\nsome cause that history has not recorded, or unknown to the state\r\nof medical science of those days. There are doubtless many cases of\r\napparently causeless unfruitfulness in marriage that even physicians,\r\nwith a knowledge of all apparent conditions in the parties cannot\r\nexplain; but when, as elsewhere related in this volume, impregnation\r\nby artificial means is successfully practised, it is useless\r\nto attribute barrenness to purely psychological and adaptative\r\ninfluences.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPRODUCING BOYS OR GIRLS AT WILL.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. CAN THE SEXES BE PRODUCED AT WILL?--This question has been asked in\r\nall ages of the world. Many theories have been advanced, but science\r\nhas at last replied with some authority. The following are the best\r\nknown authorities which this age of science has produced.\r\n\r\n2. THE AGRICULTURAL THEORY.--The agricultural theory as it may be\r\ncalled, because adopted by farmers, is that impregnation occurring\r\nwithin four days of the close of the female monthlies produces a girl,\r\nbecause the ovum is yet immature; but that when it occurs after\r\nthe fourth day from its close, gives a boy, because this egg is now\r\nmature; whereas after about the eighth day this egg dissolves and\r\npasses off, so that impregnation is thereby rendered impossible, till\r\njust before the mother's next monthly.--_Sexual Science._\r\n\r\n3. QUEEN BEES LAY FEMALE EGGS FIRST, and male after wards. So with\r\nhens; the first eggs laid after the tread give females, the last\r\nmales. Mares shown the stallion late in their periods drop horse colts\r\nrather than fillies.--_Napheys._\r\n\r\n4. IF YOU WISH FEMALES, give the male at the first sign of heat; if\r\nmales, at its end.--_Prof. Thury._\r\n\r\n5. ON TWENTY-TWO SUCCESSIVE OCCASIONS I desired to have heifers, and\r\nsucceeded in every case. I have made in all twenty-nine experiments,\r\nafter this method, and succeeded in every one, in producing the sex I\r\ndesired.--_A Swiss Breeder._\r\n\r\n6. THIS THURY PLAN has been tried on the farms of the Emperor of the\r\nFrench with unvarying success.\r\n\r\n7. CONCEPTION IN THE FIRST HALF of the time between the menstrual\r\nperiods produces females, and males in the latter.--_London Lancet._\r\n\r\n8. INTERCOURSE in from two to six days after cessation of the menses\r\nproduces girls, in from nine to twelve, boys.--_Medical Reporter._\r\n\r\nTHE MOST MALE POWER and passion creates boys; female girls. This law\r\nprobably causes those agricultural facts just cited thus: Conception\r\nright after menstruation give girls, because the female is then the\r\nmost impassioned; later, boys, because her wanting sexual warmth\r\nleaves him the most vigorous. Mere sexual excitement, a wild, fierce,\r\nfurious rush of passion, is not only not sexual vigor, but in its\r\ninverse ratio; and a genuine insane fervor caused by weakness; just as\r\na like nervous excitability indicates weak nerves instead of strong.\r\nSexual power is deliberate, not wild; cool, not impetuous; while all\r\nfalse excitement diminishes effectiveness.--_Fowler._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEALTHY CHILDREN.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nABORTION OR MISCARRIAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. ABORTION OR MISCARRIAGE is the expulsion of the child from the womb\r\nprevious to six months; after that it is called premature birth.\r\n\r\n2. CAUSES.--It may be due to a criminal act of taking medicine for\r\nthe express purpose of producing miscarriage or it may be caused by\r\ncertain medicines, severe sickness or nervousness, syphilis, imperfect\r\nsemen, lack of room in the pelvis and abdomen, lifting, straining,\r\nviolent cold, sudden mental excitement, excessive sexual intercourse,\r\ndancing, tight lacing, the use of strong purgative medicines, bodily\r\nfatigue, late suppers, and fashionable amusements.\r\n\r\n3. SYMPTOMS.--A falling or weakness and uneasiness in the region of\r\nthe loins, thighs and womb, pain in the small of the back, vomiting\r\nand sickness of the stomach, chilliness with a discharge of blood\r\naccompanied with pain in the lower portions of the abdomen. These may\r\ntake place in a single hour, or it may continue for several days. If\r\nbefore the fourth month, there is not so much danger, but the flow\r\nof blood is generally greater. If miscarriage is the result of an\r\naccident, it generally takes place without much warning, and the\r\nservice of a physician should at once be secured.\r\n\r\n4. HOME TREATMENT.--A simple application of cold water externally\r\napplied will produce relief, or cold cloths of ice, if convenient,\r\napplied to the lower portions of the abdomen. Perfect quiet, however,\r\nis the most essential thing for the patient. She should lie on her\r\nback and take internally a teaspoonful of paregoric every two hours;\r\ndrink freely of lemonade or other cooling drinks, and for nourishment\r\nsubsist chiefly on chicken broth, toast, water gruel, fresh fruits,\r\netc. The principal homeopathic remedies for this disease are ergot and\r\ncimicifuga, given in drop-doses of the tinctures.\r\n\r\n5. INJURIOUS EFFECTS.--Miscarriage is a very serious difficulty, and\r\nthe health and the constitution may be permanently impaired. Any one\r\nprone to miscarriage should adopt every measure possible to strengthen\r\nand build up the system; avoid going up stairs or doing much heavy\r\nlifting or hard work.\r\n\r\n6. PREVENTION.--Practice the laws of sexual abstinence, take frequent\r\nsitz-baths, live on oatmeal, graham bread, and other nourishing diet.\r\nAvoid highly seasoned food, rich gravies, late suppers and the like.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN INDIAN FAMILY. THE SAVAGE INDIAN TEACHES US LESSONS\r\nOF CIVILIZATION.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE MURDER OF THE INNOCENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. MANY CAUSES.--Many causes have operated to produce a corruption\r\nof the public morals so deplorable; prominent among which may be\r\nmentioned the facility with which divorces may be obtained in some of\r\nthe States, the constant promulgation of false ideas of marriage and\r\nits duties by means of books, lectures, etc., and the distribution\r\nthrough the mails of impure publications. But an influence not less\r\npowerful than any of these is the growing devotion of fashion and\r\nluxury of this age, and the idea which practically obtains to so great\r\nan extent that pleasure, instead of the health or morals, is the great\r\nobject of life.\r\n\r\n2. A MONSTROUS CRIME.--The abiding interest we feel in the\r\npreservation of the morals of our country, constrains us to raise our\r\nvoice against the daily increasing practice of infanticide, especially\r\nbefore birth. The notoriety that monstrous crime has obtained of late,\r\nand the hecatombs of infants that are annually sacrificed to Moloch,\r\nto gratify an unlawful passion, are a sufficient justification for our\r\nalluding to a painful and delicate subject, which should \"not even be\r\nnamed,\" only to correct and admonish the wrong-doers.\r\n\r\n3. LOCALITIES IN WHICH IT IS MOST PREVALENT.--We may observe that the\r\ncrying sin of infanticide is most prevalent In those localities where\r\nthe system of moral education has been longest neglected. This inhuman\r\ncrime might be compared to the murder of the innocents, except that\r\nthe criminals, in this case, exceed in enormity the cruelty of Herod.\r\n\r\n4. SHEDDING INNOCENT BLOOD.--If it is a sin to take away the life even\r\nof an enemy; if the crime of shedding innocent blood cries to heaven\r\nfor vengeance; in what language can we characterize the double guilt\r\nof those whose souls are stained with the innocent blood of their own\r\nunborn, unregenerated offspring?\r\n\r\n5. THE GREATNESS OF THE CRIME.--The murder of an infant before its\r\nbirth, is, in the sight of God and the law, as great a crime as the\r\nkilling of a child after birth.\r\n\r\n6. LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY.--Every State of the Union has made this\r\noffense one of the most serious crimes. The law has no mercy for the\r\noffenders that violate the sacred law of human life. It is murder of\r\nthe most cowardly character and woe to him who brings this curse upon\r\nhis head, to haunt him all the days of his or her life, and to curse\r\nhim at the day of his death.\r\n\r\n7. THE PRODUCT OF LUST.--Lust pure and simple. The only difference\r\nbetween a marriage of this character and prostitution is, that\r\nsociety, rotten to its heart, pulpits afraid to cry aloud against\r\ncrime and vice, and the church conformed to the world, have made such\r\na profanation of marriage respectable. To put it in other words, when\r\ntwo people determine to live together as husband and wife, and evade\r\nthe consequences and responsibilities of marriage, they are simply\r\nengaged in prostitution without the infamy which attaches to that vice\r\nand crime.\r\n\r\n8. OUTRAGEOUS VIOLATION OF ALL LAW.--The violation of all law, both\r\nnatural and revealed, is the cool and villainous contract by which\r\npeople entering into the marital relation engage in defiance of the\r\nlaws of God and the laws of the commonwealth, that they shall be\r\nunencumbered with a family of children. \"Disguise the matter as you\r\nwill,\" says Dr. Pomeroy, \"yet the fact remains that the first and\r\nspecific object of marriage is the rearing of a family.\" \"Be fruitful\r\nand multiply and replenish the earth,\" is God's first word to Adam\r\nafter his creation.\r\n\r\n9. THE NATIONAL SIN.--The prevention of offspring is preeminently the\r\nsin of America. It is fast becoming the national sin of America,\r\nand if it is not checked, it will sooner or later be an irremediable\r\ncalamity. The sin has its roots in a low and perverted idea of\r\nmarriage, and is fostered by false standards of modesty.\r\n\r\n10. THE SIN OF HEROD.--Do these same white-walled sepulchres of\r\nhell know that they are committing the damning sin of Herod in the\r\nslaughter of the innocents, and are accessories before the fact to the\r\ncrime of murder? Do women in all circles of society, when practicing\r\nthese terrible crimes realize the real danger? Do they understand that\r\nit is undermining their health, and their constitution, and that their\r\ndestiny, if persisted in, is a premature grave just as sure as the\r\nsun rises in the heavens? Let all beware and let the first and only\r\npurpose be, to live a life guiltless before God and man.\r\n\r\n11. THE CRIME OF ABORTION.--From the moment of conception a new life\r\ncommences; a new individual exists; another child is added to the\r\nfamily. The mother who deliberately sets about to destroy this life,\r\neither by want of care, or by taking drugs, or using instruments,\r\ncommits as great a crime, and is just as guilty as if she strangled\r\nher new-born infant or as if she snatched from her own breast her six\r\nmonths' darling and dashed out its brains against the wall. Its blood\r\nis upon her head, and as sure as there is a God and a judgment, that\r\nblood will be required of her. The crime she commits is murder, child\r\nmurder--the slaughter of a speechless, helpless being, whom it is her\r\nduty, beyond all things else, to cherish and preserve.\r\n\r\n12. DANGEROUS DISEASES.--We appeal to all such with earnest and with\r\nthreatening words. If they have no feeling for the fruit of their\r\nwomb, if maternal sentiment is so callous in their breasts, let them\r\nknow that such produced abortions are the constant cause of violent\r\nand, dangerous womb diseases, and frequently of early death; that they\r\nbring on mental weakness, and often insanity; that they are the most\r\ncertain means to destroy domestic happiness which can be adopted.\r\nBetter, far better, to bear a child every year for twenty years than\r\nto resort to such a wicked and injurious step; better to die, if need\r\nbe, of the pangs of child-birth, than to live with such a weight of\r\nsin on the conscience.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE UNWELCOME CHILD.[Footnote: This is the title of a pamphlet written\r\nby Henry C. Wright. We have taken some extracts from it.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1. TOO OFTEN THE HUSBAND thinks only of his personal gratification;\r\nhe insists upon what he calls his rights(?); forces on his wife an\r\n_unwelcome child_, and thereby often alienates her affections, if he\r\ndoes not drive her to abortion.\r\n\r\nDr Stockham reports the following case: \"A woman once consulted me who\r\nwas the mother of five children, all born within ten years. These were\r\npuny, scrofulous, nervous and irritable. She herself was a fit subject\r\nfor doctors and drugs. Every organ in her body seemed diseased, and\r\nevery function perverted. She was dragging out a miserable existence.\r\nLike other physicians, I had prescribed in vain for her many\r\nmaladies. One day she chanced to inquire how she could safely prevent\r\nconception. This led me to ask how great was the danger. She said:\r\n'Unless my husband is absent from home, few nights have been exempt\r\nsince we were married, except it may be three or four immediately\r\nafter confinement.'\r\n\r\n\"'And yet your husband loves you?'\r\n\r\n\"'O, yes, he is kind and provides for his family. Perhaps I might\r\nlove him but for this. While now--(will God forgive me?)--_I detest, I\r\nloathe him_, and if I knew how to support myself and children, I would\r\nleave him.'\r\n\r\n\"'Can you talk with him upon this subject?'\r\n\r\n\"'I think I can.'\r\n\r\n\"'Then there is hope, for many women cannot do that. Tell him I will\r\ngive you treatment to improve your health and if he will wait until\r\nyou can respond, _take time for the act, have it entirely mutual from\r\nfirst to last_, the demand will not come so frequent.'\r\n\r\n\"'Do you think so?'\r\n\r\n\"'The experience of many proves the truth of this statement.'\r\n\r\n\"Hopefully she went home, and in six months I had the satisfaction of\r\nknowing my patient was restored to health, and a single coition in\r\na month gave the husband more satisfaction than the many had done\r\npreviously, that the creative power was under control, and that my\r\nlady could proudly say 'I love,' where previously she said 'I hate.'\r\n\r\n\"If husbands will listen, a few simple instructions will appeal to\r\ntheir _common sense_, and none can imagine the gain to themselves, to\r\ntheir wives and children, and their children's children. Then it may\r\nnot be said of the babes that the 'Death borders on their birth, and\r\ntheir cradle stands in the grave.'\"\r\n\r\n2. WIVES! BE FRANK AND TRUE to your husbands on the subject of\r\nmaternity, and the relation that leads to it. Interchange thoughts and\r\nfeelings with them as to what nature allows or demands in regard to\r\nthese. Can maternity be natural when it is undesigned by the father\r\nor undesired by the mother? Can a maternity be natural, healthful,\r\nennobling to the mother, to the child, to the father, and to the\r\nhome, when no loving, tender, anxious forethought presides over thee\r\nrelation in which it originated?--when the mother's nature loathed\r\nand repelled it, and the father's only thought was his own selfish\r\ngratification; the feelings and conditions of the mother, and the\r\nhealth, character and destiny of the child that may result being\r\nignored by him. Wives! let there be a perfect and loving understanding\r\nbetween you and your husbands on these matters, and great will be your\r\nreward.\r\n\r\n3. A WOMAN WRITES:--\"There are few, vary few, wives and mothers who\r\ncould not reveal a sad, dark picture in their own experience in their\r\nrelations to their husbands and their children. Maternity, and\r\nthe relation in which it originates, are thrust upon them by their\r\nhusbands, often without regard to their spiritual or physical\r\nconditions, and often in contempt of their earnest and urgent\r\nentreaties. No joy comes to their heart at the conception and birth of\r\ntheir children, except that which arises from the consciousness that\r\nthey have survived the sufferings wantonly and selfishly inflicted\r\nupon them.\"\r\n\r\n4. HUSBAND, WHEN MATERNITY is imposed on your wife without her\r\nconsent, and contrary to her appeal, how will her mind necessarily\r\nbe affected towards her child? It was conceived in dread and in\r\nbitterness of spirit. Every stage of its foetal development is watched\r\nwith feeling of settled repugnance. In every step of its ante-natal\r\nprogress the child meets only with grief and indignation in the\r\nmother. She would crush out its life, if she could. She loathed\r\nits conception; she loathed it in every stage of its ante-natal\r\ndevelopment. Instead of fixing her mind on devising ways and means\r\nfor the healthful and happy organization and development of her child\r\nbefore it is born, and for its post natal comfort and support, her\r\nsoul may be intent on its destruction, and her thoughts devise plans\r\nto kill it. In this, how often is she aided by others! There are\r\nthose, and they are called men and women, whose profession is to\r\ndevise ways to kill children before they are born. Those who do this\r\nwould not hesitate (but for the consequences) to kill them after\r\nthey are born, for the state of mind that would justify and instigate\r\n_ante-natal_ child-murder would justify and instigate _post-natal_\r\nchild-murder. Yet, public sentiment consigns the murderer of\r\npost-natal children to the dungeon or the gallows, while the murderers\r\nof antenatal children are often allowed to pass in society as honest\r\nand honorable men and women.\r\n\r\n5. THE FOLLOWING IS AN EXTRACT from a letter written by one who has\r\nproudly and nobly filled the station of a wife and mother, and whose\r\nchildren and grandchildren surround her and crown her life with\r\ntenderest love and respect:\r\n\r\n\"It has often been a matter of wonder to me that men should, so\r\nheedlessly, and so injuriously to themselves, their wives and\r\nchildren, and their homes, demand at once, as soon as they get legal\r\npossession of their wives, the gratification of a passion, which, when\r\nindulged merely for the sake of the gratification of the moment, must\r\nend in the destruction of all that is beautiful, noble and divine\r\nin man or woman. I have often felt that I would give the world for a\r\nfriendship with man that should show no impurity in its bearing,\r\nand for a conjugal relation that would, at all times, heartily and\r\npractically recognize the right of the wife to decide for herself when\r\nshe should enter into the relation that leads to maternity.\"\r\n\r\n6. TIMELY ADVICE.--Here let me say that on no subject should a man and\r\nwoman, as they are being attracted into conjugal relations, be more\r\nopen and truthful with each other than on this. No woman, who would\r\nsave herself and the man she loves from a desecrated and wretched\r\nhome, should enter into the physical relations of marriage with a man\r\nuntil she understands what he expects of her as to the function of\r\nmaternity, and the relation that leads to it. If a woman is made aware\r\nthat the man who would win her as a wife regards her and the marriage\r\nrelation only as the means of a legalized gratification of his\r\npassions, and she sees fit to live with him as a wife, with such a\r\nprospect before her, she must take the consequences of a course so\r\ndegrading and so shameless. If she sees fit to make an offering of her\r\nbody and soul on the altar of her husband's sensuality, she must do\r\nit; but she has a right to know to what base uses her womanhood is to\r\nbe put, and it is due to her, as well as to himself, that he should\r\ntell beforehand precisely what he wants and expects of her.\r\n\r\nToo frequently, man shrinks from all allusion, during courtship, to\r\nhis expectations in regard to future passional relations. He fears to\r\nspeak of them, lest he should shock and repel the woman he would win\r\nas a wife. Being conscious, it may be, of an intention to use power\r\nhe may acquire over her person for his own gratification, he shuns\r\nall interchange of views with her, lest she should divine the hidden\r\nsensualism of his soul, and his intention to victimize her person to\r\nit the moment he shall get the license. A woman had better die at\r\nonce than enter into or continue in marriage with a man whose highest\r\nconception of the relation is, that it is a means of licensed animal\r\nindulgence. In such a relation, body and soul are sacrificed.\r\n\r\n7. ONE DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTIC of a true and noble husband is a\r\nfeeling of manly pride in the physical elements of his manhood. His\r\nphysical manhood, as well as his soul, is dear to the heart of his\r\nwife, because through this he can give the fullest expression of his\r\nmanly power. How can you, my friend, secure for your person the loving\r\ncare and respect of your wife? There is but one way: so manifest\r\nyourself to her, in the hours of your most endearing intimacies,\r\nthat all your manly power shall be associated only with all that\r\nis generous, just and noble in you, and with purity, freedom and\r\nhappiness in her. Make her feel that all which constitutes you a man,\r\nand qualifies you to be her husband and the father of her children,\r\nbelongs to her, and is sacredly consecrated to the perfection and\r\nhappiness of her nature. Do this, and the happiness of your home is\r\nmade complete Your _body_ will be lovingly and reverently cared for,\r\nbecause the wife of your bosom feels that it is the sacred symbol\r\nthrough which a noble, manly love is ever speaking to her, to cheer\r\nand sustain her.\r\n\r\n8. WOMAN IS EVER PROUD, and justly so, of the manly passion of her\r\nhusband, when she knows it is controlled by a love for her, whose\r\nmanifestations have regard only to her elevation and happiness. The\r\npower which, when bent only on selfish indulgence, becomes a source\r\nof more shame, degradation, disease and wretchedness, to women and to\r\nchildren than all other things put together, does but ennoble her, add\r\ngrace and glory to her being, and concentrate and vitalize the love\r\nthat encircles her as a wife when it is controlled by wisdom and\r\nconsecrated to her highest growth and happiness, and that of her\r\nchildren. It lends enchantment to her person, and gives a fascination\r\nto her smiles, her words and her caresses, which ever breathe of\r\npurity and of heaven, and make her all lovely as a wife and mother\r\nto her husband and the father of her child. _Manly passion is to the\r\nconjugal love of the wife like the sun to the rose-bud, that opens its\r\npetals, and causes them to give out their sweetest fragrance and to\r\ndisplay their most delicate tints; or like the frost, which chills and\r\nkills it ere it blossoms in its richness and beauty._\r\n\r\n9. A DIADEM OF BEAUTY.--Maternity, when it exists at the call of the\r\nwife, and is gratefully received, but binds her heart more tenderly\r\nand devotedly to her husband. As the father of her child, he stands\r\nbefore her invested with new beauty and dignity. In receiving from him\r\nthe germ of a new life, she receives that which she feels is to add\r\nnew beauty and glory to her as a woman--a new grace and attraction to\r\nher as a wife. She loves and honors him, because he has crowned\r\nher with the glory of a mother. Maternity, to her, instead of being\r\nrepulsive, is a diadem of beauty, a crown of rejoicing; and deep,\r\ntender, and self-forgetting are her love and reverence for him who\r\nhas placed it on her brow. How noble, how august, how beautiful is\r\nmaternity when thus bestowed and received!\r\n\r\n10. CONCLUSION.--Would you, then, secure the love and trust of\r\nyour wife, and become an object of her ever-growing tenderness and\r\nreverence? Assure her, by all your manifestations, and your perfect\r\nrespect for the functions of her nature, that your passion shall be\r\nin subjection of her wishes. It is not enough that you have secured\r\nin her heart respect for your spiritual and intellectual manhood. To\r\nmaintain your self-respect in your relations with her, to perfect\r\nyour growth and happiness as a husband, you must cause your _physical_\r\nnature to be tenderly cherished and reverenced by her in all the\r\nsacred intimacies of home. No matter how much she reverences your\r\nintellectual or your social power, if by reason of your uncalled-for\r\npassional manifestations you have made your physical manhood\r\ndisagreeable, how can you, in her presence, preserve a sense of manly\r\npride and dignity as a husband?\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHEALTH AND DISEASE.\r\n\r\nHeredity and the Transmission of Diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. BAD HABITS.--It is known that the girl who marries the man with bad\r\nhabits, is, in a measure, responsible for the evil tendencies which\r\nthese habits have created in the children; and young people are\r\nconstantly warned of the danger in marrying when they know they come\r\nfrom families troubled with chronic diseases or insanity. To be\r\nsure the warnings have had little effect thus far in preventing such\r\nmarriages, and it is doubtful whether they will, unless the prophecy\r\nof an extremist writing for one of our periodicals comes to pass--that\r\nthe time is not far distant when such marriages will be a crime\r\npunishable by law.\r\n\r\n2. TENDENCY IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.--That there is a tendency in the\r\nright direction must be admitted, and is perhaps most clearly shown in\r\nsome of the articles on prison reform. Many of them strongly urge the\r\nnecessity of preventive work as the truest economy, and some go so far\r\nas to say that if the present human knowledge of the laws of heredity\r\nwere acted upon for a generation, reformatory measures would be\r\nrendered unnecessary.\r\n\r\n3. SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES.--The mother who has ruined her health by\r\nlate hours, highly-spiced food, and general carelessness in regard to\r\nhygienic laws, and the father who is the slave of questionable habits,\r\nwill be very sure to have children either mentally or morally inferior\r\nto what they might otherwise have had a right to expect. But the\r\nprenatal influences may be such that evils arising from such may be\r\nmodified to a great degree.\r\n\r\n4. FORMATION OF CHARACTER.--I believe that pre-natal influences may\r\ndo as much in the formation of character as all the education that can\r\ncome after, and that the mother may, in a measure, \"will\" what that\r\ninfluence shall be, and that, as knowledge on the subject increases,\r\nit will be more and more under their control. In that, as in\r\neverything else, things that would be possible with one mother would\r\nnot be with another, and measures that would be successful with one\r\nwould produce opposite results from the other.\r\n\r\n5. INHERITING DISEASE. Consumption--that dread foe of modern life--is\r\nthe most frequently encountered of all affections as the result of\r\ninherited predispositions. Indeed, some of the most eminent physicians\r\nhave believed it is never produced in any other way. Heart disease,\r\ndisease of the throat, excessive obesity, affections of the skin,\r\nasthma, disorders of the brain and nervous system, gout, rheumatism\r\nand cancer, are all hereditary. A tendency to bleed frequently,\r\nprofusely and uncontrollably, from trifling wounds, is often met with\r\nas a family affection.\r\n\r\n6. MENTAL DERANGEMENTS.--Almost all forms of mental derangements\r\nare hereditary--one of the parents or near relation being afflicted.\r\nPhysical or bodily weakness is often hereditary, such as scrofula,\r\ngout, rheumatism, rickets, consumption, apoplexy, hernia, urinary\r\ncalculi, hemorrhoids or piles, cataract, etc. In fact, all physical\r\nweakness, if ingrafted in either parent, is transmitted from parents\r\nto offspring, and is often more strongly marked in the latter than in\r\nthe former.\r\n\r\n7. MARKS AND DEFORMITIES.--Marks and deformities are all transmissible\r\nfrom parents to offspring, equally with diseases and peculiar\r\nproclivities. Among such blemishes may be mentioned moles, hair-lips,\r\ndeficient or supernumerary fingers, toes, and other characteristics.\r\nIt is also asserted that dogs and cats that have accidentally lost\r\ntheir tails, bring forth young similarly deformed. Blumenbach tells\r\nof a man who had lost his little finger, having children with the same\r\ndeformity.\r\n\r\n8. CAUTION.--Taking facts like these into consideration, how very\r\nimportant is it for persons, before selecting partners for life, to\r\ndeliberately weigh every element and circumstances of this nature,\r\nif they would insure a felicitous union, and not entail upon their\r\nposterity disease, misery and despair. Alas! in too many instances\r\nmatrimony is made a matter of money, while all earthly joys are\r\nsacrificed upon the accursed altars of lust and mammon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Outdoor Sports Good Training For Morals As Well As\r\nHealth.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPREPARATION FOR MATERNITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. WOMAN BEFORE MARRIAGE.--It is not too much to say that the life\r\nof women before marriage ought to be adjusted with more reference to\r\ntheir duties as mothers than to any other one earthly object. It is\r\nthe continuance of the race which is the chief purpose of marriage.\r\nThe passion of amativeness is probably, on the whole, the most\r\npowerful of all human impulses. Its purpose, however, is rather to\r\nsubserve the object of continuing the species, than merely its own\r\ngratification.\r\n\r\n2. EXERCISE.--Girls should be brought up to live much in the open air,\r\nalways with abundant clothing against wet and cold. They should be\r\nencouraged to take much active exercise; as much, if they; want to, as\r\nboys. It is as good for little girls to run and jump, to ramble in\r\nthe woods, to go boating, to ride and drive, to play and \"have fun\"\r\ngenerally, as for little boys.\r\n\r\n3. PRESERVE THE SIGHT.--Children should be carefully prevented from\r\nusing their eyes to read or write, or in any equivalent exertion,\r\neither before breakfast, by dim daylight, or by artificial light. Even\r\nschool studies should be such that they can be dealt with by daylight.\r\nLessons that cannot be learned without lamp-light study are almost\r\ncertainly excessive. This precaution should ordinarily be maintained\r\nuntil the age of puberty is reached.\r\n\r\n4. BATHING.--Bathing should be enforced according to constitutions,\r\nnot by an invariable rule, except the invariable rule of keeping\r\nclean. Not necessarily every day, nor necessarily in cold water;\r\nthough those conditions are doubtless often right in case of abundant\r\nphysical health and strength.\r\n\r\n5. WRONG HABITS.--The habit of daily natural evacuations should be\r\nsolicitously formed and maintained. Words or figures could never\r\nexpress the discomforts and wretchedness which wrong habits in this\r\nparticular have locked down upon innumerable women for years and even\r\nfor life.\r\n\r\n6. DRESS.--Dress should be warm, loose, comely, and modest rather than\r\nshowy; but it should be good enough to Satisfy a child's desires after\r\na good appearance, if they are reasonable. Children, indeed, should\r\nhave all their reasonable desires granted as far as possible; for\r\nnothing makes them reasonable so rapidly and so surely as to treat\r\nthem reasonably.\r\n\r\n7. TIGHT LACING.--Great harm is often done to maidens for want of\r\nknowledge in them, or wisdom and care in their parents. The extremes\r\nof fashions are very prone to violate not only taste, but physiology.\r\nSuch cases are tight lacing, low necked dresses, thin shoes, heavy\r\nskirts. And yet, if the ladies only knew, the most attractive costumes\r\nare not the extremes of fashion, but those which conform to fashion\r\nenough to avoid oddity, which preserve decorum and healthfulness,\r\nwhether or no; and here is the great secret of successful dress--vary\r\nfashion so as to suit the style of the individual.\r\n\r\n8. COURTSHIP AND MARRIAGE.--Last of all, parental care in the use\r\nof whatever influence can be exerted in the matter of courtship and\r\nmarriage. Maidens, as well as youths, must, after all, choose for\r\nthemselves. It is their own lives which they take in their hands\r\nas they enter the marriage state, and not their parents; and as the\r\nconsequences affect them primarily it is the plainest justice that\r\nwith the responsibility should be joined the right of choice. The\r\nparental influence, then, must be indirect and advisory. Indirect,\r\nthrough the whole bringing up of their daughter; for if they have\r\ntrained her aright, she will be incapable of enduring a fool, still\r\nmore a knave.\r\n\r\n9. A YOUNG WOMAN AND A YOUNG MAN HAD BETTER NOT BE ALONE TOGETHER VERY\r\nMUCH UNTIL THEY ARE MARRIED.--This will be found to prevent a good\r\nmany troubles. It is not meant to imply that either sex, or any member\r\nof it, is worse than another, or bad at all, or anything but human. It\r\nis simply the prescription of a safe general rule. It is no more an\r\nimputation than the rule that people had better not be left without\r\noversight in presence of large sums of other folks' money. The close\r\npersonal proximity of the sexes is greatly undesirable before\r\nmarriage. Kisses and caresses are most properly the monopoly of wives.\r\nSuch indulgences have a direct and powerful physiological effect. Nay,\r\nthey often lead to the most fatal results.\r\n\r\n10. IGNORANCE BEFORE MARRIAGE.--At some time before marriage those\r\nwho are to enter into it ought to be made acquainted with some of\r\nthe plainest common-sense limitations which should govern their new\r\nrelations to each other. Ignorance in such matters has caused an\r\ninfinite amount of disgust, pain and unhappiness. It is not necessary\r\nto specify particulars here; see other portions of this work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A HEALTHY MOTHER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIMPREGNATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. CONCEPTION OR IMPREGNATION.--Conception or impregnation takes\r\nplace by the union of the male sperm and female sperm. Whether this\r\nis accomplished in the ovaries, the oviducts or the uterus, is still a\r\nquestion of discussion and investigation by physiologists.\r\n\r\n2. PASSING OFF THE OVUM.--\"With many women,\" says Dr. Stockham in her\r\nTokology, \"the ovum passes off within twenty-four or forty-eight hours\r\nafter menstruation begins. Some, by careful observation, are able to\r\nknow with certainty when this takes place. It is often accompanied\r\nwith malaise, nervousness, headache or actual uterine pain. A minute\r\nsubstance like the white of an egg, with a fleck of blood in it, can\r\nfrequently be seen upon the clothing. Ladies who have noticed this\r\nphenomenon testify to its recurring very regularly upon the same day\r\nafter menstruation. Some delicate women have observed it as late as\r\nthe fourteenth day.\"\r\n\r\n3. CALCULATIONS.--Conception is more liable to take place either\r\nimmediately before or immediately after the period, and, on that\r\naccount it is usual when calculating the date at which to expect\r\nlabor, to count from the day of disappearance of the last period. The\r\neasiest way to make a calculation is to count back three months from\r\nthe date of the last period and add seven days; thus we might say that\r\nthe date was the 18th of July; counting back brings us to the 18th\r\nof April, and adding the seven days will bring us to the 25th day of\r\nApril, the expected time.\r\n\r\n4. EVIDENCE OF CONCEPTION.--Very many medical authorities,\r\ndistinguished in this line, have stated their belief that women never\r\npass more than two or three days at the most beyond the forty weeks\r\nconceded to pregnancy--that is two hundred and eighty days or ten\r\nlunar months, or nine calendar months and a week. About two hundred\r\nand eighty days will represent the average duration of pregnancy,\r\ncounting from the last day of the last period. Now it must be borne\r\nin mind, that there are many disturbing elements which might cause\r\nthe young married woman to miss a time. During the first month of\r\npregnancy there is no sign by which the condition may be positively\r\nknown. The missing of a period, especially in a person who has, been\r\nregular for some time, may lead one to suspect it; but there are many\r\nattendant causes in married life, the little annoyances of household\r\nduties, embarrassments, and the enforced gayety which naturally\r\nsurrounds the bride, and these should all be taken into consideration\r\nin the discussion as to whether or not she is pregnant. But then,\r\nagain, there are some rare cases who have menstruated throughout their\r\npregnancy, and also cases where menstruation was never established and\r\npregnancy occurred. Nevertheless, the non-appearance of the period,\r\nwith other signs, may be taken as presumptive evidence.\r\n\r\n5. \"ARTIFICIAL IMPREGNATION\".--It may not be generally known that\r\nunion is not essential to impregnation; it is possible for conception\r\nto occur without congress. All that is necessary is that seminal\r\nanimalcules enter the womb and unite there with the egg or ovum. It is\r\nnot essential that the semen be introduced through the medium of the\r\nmale organ, as it has been demonstrated repeatedly that by means of\r\na syringe and freshly obtained and healthy semen, impregnation can be\r\nmade to follow by its careful introduction. There are physicians in\r\nFrance who make a specialty of \"Artificial Impregnation,\" as it is\r\ncalled, and produce children to otherwise childless couples, being\r\nsuccessful in many instances in supplying them as they are desired.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF PREGNANCY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE FIRST SIGN.--The first sign that leads a lady to suspect that\r\nshe is pregnant is her ceasing-to-be-unwell. This, provided she has\r\njust before been in good health, is a strong symptom of pregnancy; but\r\nstill there must be others to corroborate it.\r\n\r\n2. ABNORMAL CONDITION.--Occasionally, women menstruate during\r\nthe entire time of gestation. This, without doubt, is an abnormal\r\ncondition, and should be remedied, as disastrous consequences may\r\nresult. Also, women have been known to bear children who have never\r\nmenstruated. The cases are rare of pregnancy taking place where\r\nmenstruation has never occurred, yet it frequently happens that women\r\nnever menstruate from one pregnancy to another. In these cases this\r\nsymptom is ruled out for diagnotic purposes.\r\n\r\n3. MAY PROCEED FROM OTHER CAUSES.--But a ceasing-to-be-unwell may\r\nproceed from other causes than that of pregnancy such as disease or\r\ndisorder of the womb or of other organs of the body--especially of\r\nthe lungs--it is not by itself alone entirely to be depended upon;\r\nalthough, as a single sign, it is, especially if the patient be\r\nhealthy, one of the most reliable of all the other signs of pregnancy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EMBRYO OF TWENTY DAYS, LAID OPEN: _b_, the Back;\r\n  _a a a_ Covering, and pinned to Back.]\r\n\r\n4. MORNING SICKNESS.--If this does not arise from a disordered\r\nstomach, it is a trustworthy sign of pregnancy. A lady who has once\r\nhad morning-sickness can always for the future distinguish it from\r\neach and from every other sickness; it is a peculiar sickness,\r\nwhich no other sickness can simulate. Moreover, it is emphatically a\r\nmorning-sickness--the patient being, as a rule, for the rest of the\r\nday entirely free from sickness or from the feeling of sickness.\r\n\r\n5. A THIRD SYMPTOM.--A third symptom is shooting, throbbing and\r\nlancinating pains in, and enlargement of the breasts, with soreness\r\nof the nipples, occurring about the second month. In some instances,\r\nafter the first few months, a small quantity of watery fluid or a\r\nlittle milk, may be squeezed out or them. This latter symptom, in a\r\nfirst pregnancy, is valuable, and can generally be relied on as fairly\r\nconclusive of pregnancy. Milk in the breast, however small it may\r\nbe in quantity, especially in a first pregnancy, is a reliable sign,\r\nindeed, we might say, a certain sign, of pregnancy.\r\n\r\n6. A DARK BROWN AREOLA OR MARK around the nipple is one of the\r\ndistinguishing signs of pregnancy--more especially of a first\r\npregnancy. Women who have had large families, seldom, even when they\r\nare not pregnant, lose this mark entirely; but when they are pregnant\r\nit is more intensely dark--the darkest brown--especially if they be\r\nbrunettes.\r\n\r\n7. QUICKENING.--Quickening is one of the most important signs of\r\npregnancy, and one of the most valuable, as at the moment it occurs,\r\nas a rule, the motion of the child is first felt, whilst, at the\r\nsame time, there is a sudden increase in the size of the abdomen.\r\nQuickening is a proof that nearly half the time of pregnancy has\r\npassed. If there be liability to miscarry, quickening makes matters\r\nmore safe, as there is less likelihood of a miscarriage after than\r\nbefore it. A lady at this time frequently feels faint or actually\r\nfaints away; she is often giddy, or sick, or nervous, and in some\r\ninstances even hysterically; although, in rare cases, some women do\r\nnot even know the precise time when they quicken.\r\n\r\n8. INCREASED SIZE AND HARDNESS OF THE ABDOMEN.--This is very\r\ncharacteristic of pregnancy. When a lady is not pregnant the\r\nabdomen is soft and flaccid; when she is pregnant, and after she\r\nhas quickened, the abdomen; over the region of the womb, is hard and\r\nresisting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EMBRYO AT THIRTY DAYS _a_, the Head; _b_, the Eyes;\r\n_d_ the Neck; _e_, the Chest; _f_, the Abdomen.]\r\n\r\n9. EXCITABILITY OF MIND.--Excitability of mind is very common in\r\npregnancy, more especially if the patient be delicate; indeed,\r\nexcitability is a sign of debility, and requires plenty of good\r\nnourishment, but few stimulants.\r\n\r\n10. ERUPTIONS ON THE SKIN.--Principally on the face, neck, or throat,\r\nare tell-tales of pregnancy, and to an experienced matron, publish the\r\nfact that an acquaintance thus marked is pregnant.\r\n\r\n11. THE FOETAL HEART.--In the fifth month there is a sign which, if\r\ndetected, furnishes indubitable evidence of conception, and that is\r\nthe sound of the child's heart. If the ear be placed on the abdomen,\r\nover the womb, the beating of the foetal heart can sometimes be heard\r\nquite plainly, and by the use of an instrument called the stethoscope,\r\nthe sounds can be still more plainly heard. This is a very valuable\r\nsign, inasmuch as the presence of the child is not only ascertained,\r\nbut also its position, and whether there are twins or more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Baby Elizabeth, Brought Into the World by the \"Twilight\r\nSleep\" Method. It Robs Child Bearing of Most of Its Terrors.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF PREGNANCY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. COSTIVE STATE OF THE BOWELS.--A costive state of the bowels\r\nis common in pregnancy; a mild laxative is therefore occasionally\r\nnecessary. The mildest must be selected, as a strong purgative\r\nis highly improper, and even dangerous. Calomel and all other\r\npreparations of mercury are to be especially avoided, as a mercurial\r\nmedicine is apt to weaken the system, and sometimes even to produce\r\na miscarriage. Let me again urge the importance of a lady, during the\r\nwhole period of pregnancy, being particular as to the state of her\r\nbowels, as costiveness is a fruitful cause of painful, tedious and\r\nhard labors.\r\n\r\n2. LAXATIVES.--The best laxatives are caster oil, salad oil, compound\r\nrhubarb pills, honey, stewed prunes, stewed rhubarb, Muscatel raisins,\r\nfigs, grapes, roasted apples, baked pears, stewed Normandy pippins,\r\ncoffee, brown-bread and treacle. Scotch oatmeal made with new milk or\r\nwater, or with equal parts of milk and water.\r\n\r\n3. PILLS.--When the motions are hard, and when the bowels are easily\r\nacted upon, two, or three, or four pills made of Castile soap will\r\nfrequently answer the purpose; and if they will, are far better than\r\nany other ordinary laxative. The following is a good form. Take of:\r\n\r\n  Castile Soap, five scruples;\r\n  Oil of Caraway, six drops;\r\n\r\nTo make twenty-four pills. Two, or three, or four to be taken at\r\nbedtime, occasionally.\r\n\r\n4. HONEY.--A teaspoonful of honey, either eaten at breakfast\r\nor dissolved in a cup of tea, will frequently, comfortably and\r\neffectually, open the bowels, and will supersede the necessity of\r\ntaking laxative medicine.\r\n\r\n5. NATURE'S MEDICINES.--Now, Nature's medicines--exercise in the open\r\nair, occupation, and household duties--on the contrary, not only at\r\nthe time open the bowels, but keep up a proper action for the future;\r\nher--their inestimable superiority.\r\n\r\n6. WARM WATER INJECTIONS.--An excellent remedy for costiveness of\r\npregnancy is an enema, either of warm water, or of Castile soap\r\nand water, which the patient, by means of a self-injecting\r\nenema-apparatus, may administer to herself. The quantity of warm water\r\nto be used, is from half a pint to a pint; the proper heat is the\r\ntemperature of new milk; the time for administering it is early in the\r\nmorning, twice or three times a week.\r\n\r\n7. MUSCULAR PAINS OF THE ABDOMEN.--The best remedy is an abdominal\r\nbelt constructed for pregnancy, and adjusted with proper straps and\r\nbuckles to accomodate the gradually increasing size of the womb. This\r\nplan often affords great comfort and relief; indeed, such a belt is\r\nindispensably necessary.\r\n\r\n8. DIARRHEA.--Although the bowels in pregnancy are generally costive,\r\nthey are sometimes in an opposite state, and are relaxed. Now,\r\nthis relaxation is frequently owing to there having been prolonged\r\nconstipation, and Nature is trying to relieve herself by purging.\r\nDo not check it, but allow it to have its course, and take a little\r\nrhubarb or magnesia. The diet should be simple, plain, and nourishing,\r\nand should consist of beef tea, chicken broth, arrow-root, and of\r\nwell-made and well-boiled oatmeal gruel. Butcher's meat, for a\r\nfew days, should not be eaten; and stimulants of all kinds must be\r\navoided.\r\n\r\n9. FIDGETS.--A pregnant lady sometimes suffers severely from\r\n\"fidgets\"; it generally affects her feet and legs, especially at\r\nnight, so as to entirely destroy her sleep; she cannot lie still; she\r\nevery few minutes moves, tosses and tumbles about--first on one side,\r\nthen on the other. The causes of \"fidgets\" are a heated state of the\r\nblood; an irritable condition of the nervous system, prevailing\r\nat that particular time; and want of occupution. The treatment of\r\n\"fidgets\" consists of: sleeping in a well-ventilated apartment, with\r\neither window or door open; a thorough ablution of the whole body\r\nevery morning, and a good washing with tepid water of the face, neck,\r\nchest, arms and hands every night; shunning hot and close rooms;\r\ntaking plenty of out-door exercise; living on a bland, nourishing,\r\nput not rich diet; avoiding meat at night, and substituting in\r\nlieu thereof, either a cupful of arrow-root made with milk, or of\r\nwell-boiled oatmeal gruel.\r\n\r\n10. EXERCISE.--If a lady, during the night, have the \"fidgets,\" she\r\nshould get out of bed; take a short walk up and down the room, being\r\nwell protected by a dressing-gown; empty her bladders turn, her\r\npillow, so as to have the cold side next the head; and then lie down\r\nagain; and the chances are that she will now fall asleep. If during\r\nthe day she have the \"fidgets,\" a ride in an open carriage; or a\r\nstroll in the garden, or in the fields; or a little housewifery,\r\nwill do her good, and there is nothing like fresh air, exercise, and\r\noccupation to drive away \"the fidgets.\"\r\n\r\n11. HEARTBURN.--Heartburn is a common and often a distressing symptom\r\nof pregnancy. The acid producing the heartburn is frequently much\r\nincreased by an overloaded stomach. An abstemious diet ought to be\r\nstrictly observed. Great attention should be paid to the quality\r\nof the food. Greens, pastry, hot buttered toast, melted butter, and\r\neverything that is rich and gross, ought to be carefully avoided.\r\nEither a teaspoonful of heavy calcined magnesia, or half a teaspoonful\r\nof carbonate of soda--the former to be preferred if there be\r\nconstipation--should occasionally be taken in a wine-glassful of warm\r\nwater. If these do not relieve--the above directions as to diet having\r\nbeen strictly attended to--the following mixture ought to be tried.\r\nTake of:\r\n\r\n  Carbonate of Ammonia, half a drachm;\r\n  Bicarbonate of Soda, a drachm and a half;\r\n  Water, eight ounces;\r\n\r\nTo make a mixture: Two tablespoonfuls to be taken twice or three times\r\na day, until relief be obtained.\r\n\r\n12. WIND IN THE STOMACH AND BOWELS.--This is a frequent reason why a\r\npregnant lady cannot sleep at night. The two most frequent causes of\r\nflatulence are, first, the want of walking exercise during the day,\r\nand second, the eating of a hearty meal just before going to bed at\r\nnight. The remedies are, of course, in each instance, self-evident.\r\n\r\n13. SWOLLEN LEGS FROM ENLARGED VEINS (VARICOSE VEINS.)--The veins are\r\nfrequently much enlarged and distended, causing the legs to be greatly\r\nswollen and very painful, preventing the patient from taking proper\r\nwalking exercise. Swollen legs are owing to the pressure of the womb\r\nupon the blood-vessels above. Women who have had large families are\r\nmore liable than others to varicose veins. If a lady marry late in\r\nlife, or if she be very heavy in pregnancy carrying the child low down\r\nshe is more likely to have distention of the veins. The best plan will\r\nbe for her to wear during the day an elastic stocking, which ought to\r\nbe made on purpose for her, in order that it may properly fit the leg\r\nand foot.\r\n\r\n14. STRETCHING OF THE SKIN OF THE ABDOMEN. This is frequently, in a\r\nfirst pregnancy, distressing, from the soreness it causes. The best\r\nremedy is to rub the abdomen, every night and morning, with warm\r\ncamphorated oil, and to wear a belt during the day and a broad flannel\r\nbandage at night, both of which should be put on moderately but\r\ncomfortably tight. The belt must be secured in its situation by means\r\nof properly adjusted straps.\r\n\r\n15. BEFORE THE APPROACH OF LABOR.--The patient, before the approach of\r\nlabor, ought to take particular care to have the bowels gently opened,\r\nas during that state a costive state greatly increases her sufferings,\r\nand lengthens the period of her labor. A gentle action is all that is\r\nnecessary; a violent one would do more harm than good.\r\n\r\n16. SWOLLEN AND PAINFUL BREASTS. The breasts are, at times, during\r\npregnancy, much swollen and very painful; and, now and then, they;\r\ncause the patient great uneasiness, as she fancies that she is going\r\nto have either some dreadful tumor or a gathering of the bosom. There\r\nneed, in such a case, be no apprehension. The swelling and the pain\r\nare the consequences of the pregnancy, and will in due time subside\r\nwithout any unpleasant result. For treatment she cannot do better than\r\nrub them well, every night and morning, with equal parts of Eau de\r\nCologne and olive oil, and wear a piece of new flannel over them;\r\ntaking care to cover the nipples with soft linen, as the friction of\r\nthe flannel might irritate them.\r\n\r\n17. BOWEL COMPLAINTS. Bowel complaints, during pregnancy, are not\r\nunfrequent. A dose either of rhubarb and magnesia, or of castor oil,\r\nare the best remedies, and are generally, in the way of medicine, all\r\nthat is necessary.\r\n\r\n18. CRAMPS. Cramps of the legs and of the thighs during the latter\r\nperiod, and especially at night, are apt to attend pregnancy, and are\r\ncaused by the womb pressing upon the nerves which extend to the lower\r\nextremities. Treatment. Tightly tie a handkerchief, folded like a\r\nneckerchief, round the limb a little above the part affected, and let\r\nit remain on for a few minutes. Friction by means of the hand either\r\nwith opodeldoc or with laudanum, taking care not to drink the lotion\r\nby mistake, will also give relief.\r\n\r\n19. THE WHITES. The whites during pregnancy, especially during the\r\nlatter months, and particularly if the lady have had many children,\r\nare frequently troublesome, and are, in a measure, occasioned by the\r\npressure of the womb on the parts below, causing irritation. The best\r\nway, therefore, to obviate such pressure is for the patient to lie\r\ndown a great part of each day either on a bed or a sofa. She ought\r\nto retire early to rest: she should sleep on a hair mattress and in\r\na well ventilated apartment, and should not overload her bed with\r\nclothes. A thick, heavy quilt at these times, and indeed at all times,\r\nis particularly objectionable; the perspiration cannot pass readily\r\nthrough it as through blankets, and thus she is weakened. She ought to\r\nlive on plain, wholesome, nourishing food; and she must abstain from\r\nbeer and wine and spirits. The bowels ought to be gently opened by\r\nmeans of a Seidlitz powder, which should occasionally be taken early\r\nin the morning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PRECIOUS FLOWER.]\r\n\r\n20. IRRITATION AND ITCHING OF THE EXTERNAL PARTS.--This is a most\r\ntroublesome affection, and may occur at any time, but more especially\r\nduring the latter period of the pregnancy. Let her diet be simple\r\nand nourishing; let her avoid stimulants of all kinds. Let her take a\r\nsitz-bath of warm water, considerably salted. Let her sit in the bath\r\nwith the body thoroughly covered.\r\n\r\n21. HOT AND INFLAMED.--The external parts, and the passage to the womb\r\n(vagina), in these cases, are not only irritable and itching, but are\r\nsometimes hot and inflamed, and are covered either with small pimples,\r\nor with a whitish exudation of the nature of aphtha (thrush), somewhat\r\nsimilar to the thrush on the mouth of an infant; then, the addition of\r\nglycerine to the lotion is a great improvement and usually gives much\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\n22. BILIOUSNESS[Footnote: Some of these valuable suggestions are taken\r\nfrom \"Parturition Without Pain,\" by Dr. M.L. Holbrook.] is defined by\r\nsome one as piggishness. Generally it may be regarded as _overfed_.\r\nThe elements of the bile are in the blood in excess of the power\r\nof the liver to eliminate them. This may be caused either from the\r\nsuperabundance of the materials from which the bile is made or by\r\ninaction of the organ itself. Being thus retained the system is\r\n_clogged_. It is the result of either too much food in quantity or too\r\nrich in quality. Especially is it caused by the excessive use of _fats\r\nand sweets_. The simplest remedy is the best. A plain, light diet with\r\nplenty of acid fruits, avoiding fats and sweets, will ameliorate or\r\nremove it. Don't force the appetite. Let hunger demand food. In the\r\nmorning the sensitiveness of the stomach may be relieved by taking\r\nbefore rising a cup of hot water, hot milk, hot lemonade, rice or\r\nbarley water, selecting according to preference. For this purpose many\r\nfind coffee made from browned wheat or corn the best drink. Depend for\r\na time upon liquid food that can be taken up by absorbents. The juice\r\nof lemons and other acid fruits is usually grateful, and assists in\r\nassimilating any excess in nutriment. These may be diluted according\r\nto taste. With many, an egg lemonade proves relishing and acceptable.\r\n\r\n23. DERANGED APPETITE.--Where the appetite fails, let the patient go\r\nwithout eating for a little while, say for two or three meals.\r\nIf, however, the strength begins to go, try the offering of some\r\nunexpected delicacy; or give small quantities of nourishing food, as\r\ndirected in case of morning sickness.\r\n\r\n24. PILES.--For cases of significance consult a physician. As\r\nwith constipation, so with piles, its frequent result, fruit diet,\r\nexercise, and sitz-bath regimen will do much to prevent the trouble.\r\nFrequent local applications of a cold compress, and even of ice, and\r\ntepid water injections, are of great service. Walking or standing\r\naggravate this complaint. Lying down alleviates it. Dr. Shaw says,\r\n\"There is nothing in the world that will produce so great relief in\r\npiles as fasting. If the fit is severe, live a whole day, or even two,\r\nif necessary, upon pure soft cold water alone. Give then very lightly\r\nof vegetable food.\"\r\n\r\n25. TOOTHACHE.--There is a sort of proverb that a woman loses one\r\ntooth every time she has a child. Neuralgic toothache during pregnancy\r\nis, at any rate, extremely common, and often has to be endured. It is\r\ngenerally thought not best to have teeth extracted during pregnancy,\r\nas the shock to the nervous system has sometimes caused miscarriage.\r\nTo wash out the mouth morning and night with cold or lukewarm water\r\nand salt is often of use. If the teeth are decayed, consult a good\r\ndentist in the early stages of pregnancy, and have the offending teeth\r\nproperly dressed. Good dentists, in the present state of the science,\r\nextract very few teeth, but save them.\r\n\r\n26. SALIVATION.--Excessive secretion of the saliva has usually been\r\nreckoned substantially incurable. Fasting, cold water treatment,\r\nexercise and fruit diet may be relied on to prevent, cure or alleviate\r\nit, where this is possible, as it frequently is.\r\n\r\n27. HEADACHE.--This is, perhaps, almost as common in cases of\r\npregnancy as \"morning sickness.\" It may be from determination of blood\r\nto the head, from constipation or indigestion, constitutional \"sick\r\nheadache,\" from neuralgia, from a cold, from rheumatism. Correct\r\nliving will prevent much headache trouble; and where this does not\r\nanswer the purpose, rubbing and making magnetic passes over the head\r\nby the hand of some healthy magnetic person will often prove of great\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n28. LIVER-SPOTS.--These, on the face, must probably be endured, as no\r\ntrustworthy way of driving them off is known.\r\n\r\n29. JAUNDICE.--See the doctor.\r\n\r\n30. PAIN ON THE RIGHT SIDE.--This is liable to occur from about the\r\nfifth to the eighth month, and is attributed to the pressure of\r\nthe enlarging womb upon the liver. Proper living is most likely to\r\nalleviate it. Wearing a wet girdle in daytime or a wet compress at\r\nnight, sitz-baths, and friction with the wet hand may also be tried.\r\nIf the pain is severe a mustard poultice may be used. Exercise should\r\nbe carefully moderated if found to increase the pain. If there is\r\nfever and inflammation with it, consult a physician. It is usually not\r\ndangerous, but uncomfortable only.\r\n\r\n31. PALPITATION OF THE HEART.--To be prevented by healthy living and\r\ncalm, good humor. Lying down will often gradually relieve it, so will\r\na compress wet with water, as hot as can be borne, placed over the\r\nheart and renewed as often as it gets cool.\r\n\r\n32. FAINTING.--Most likely to be caused by \"quickening,\" or else by\r\ntight dress, bad air, over-exertion, or other unhealthy living. It\r\nis not often dangerous. Lay the patient in an easy posture, the head\r\nrather low than high, and where cool air may blow across the face;\r\nloosen the dress if tight; sprinkle cold water on the face and hands.\r\n\r\n33. SLEEPLESSNESS.--Most likely to be caused by incorrect living,\r\nand to be prevented and cured by the opposite. A glass or two of cold\r\nwater drank deliberately on going to bed often helps one to go to\r\nsleep; so does bathing the face and hands and the feet in cold water.\r\nA short nap in the latter part of the forenoon can sometimes be had,\r\nand is of use. Such a nap ought not to be too long, or it leaves a\r\nheavy feeling; it should be sought with the mind in a calm state, in\r\na well-ventilated though darkened room, and with the clothing removed,\r\nas at night. A similar nap in the afternoon is not so good, but is\r\nbetter than nothing. The tepid sitz-bath on going to bed will often\r\nproduce sleep, and so will gentle percussion given by an attendant\r\nwith palms of the hand over the back for a few minutes on retiring. To\r\nsecure sound sleep do not read, write or severely tax the mind in the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMORNING SICKNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A pregnant woman is especially liable to suffer many forms of\r\ndyspepsia, nervous troubles, sleeplessness, etc.\r\n\r\n2. MORNING SICKNESS is the most common and is the result of an\r\nirritation in the womb, caused by some derangement, and it is greatly\r\nirritated by the habit of indulging in sexual gratification during\r\npregnancy. If people would imitate the lower animals and reserve the\r\nvital forces of the mother for the benefit of her unborn child, it\r\nwould be a great boon to humanity. Morning sickness may begin the next\r\nday after conception, but it usually appears from two to three weeks\r\nafter the beginning of pregnancy and continues with more or less\r\nseverity from two to four months.\r\n\r\n3. HOME TREATMENT FOR MORNING SICKNESS.--Avoid all highly seasoned and\r\nrich food. Also avoid strong tea and coffee. Eat especially light\r\nand simple suppers at five o'clock and no later than six. Some simple\r\nbroths, such as will be found in the cooking department of this book\r\nwill be very nourishing and soothing. Coffee made from brown wheat or\r\ncorn is an excellent remedy to use. The juice of lemons reduced with\r\nwater will sometimes prove very effectual. A good lemonade with an egg\r\nwell stirred is very nourishing and toning to the stomach.\r\n\r\n4. HOT FOMENTATION on the stomach and liver is excellent, and warm and\r\nhot water injections are highly beneficial.\r\n\r\n5. A little powdered magnesia at bed time, taken in a little milk,\r\nwill often give almost permanent relief.\r\n\r\n6. Avoid corsets or any other pressure upon the stomach. All garments\r\nmust be worn loosely. In many cases this will entirely prevent all\r\nstomach disturbances.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRELATION OF HUSBAND AND WIFE DURING PREGNANCY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. MISCARRIAGE.--If the wife is subject to miscarriage every\r\nprecaution should be employed to prevent its happening again. Under\r\nsuch exceptional circumstances the husband should sleep apart the\r\nfirst five months of pregnancy; after that length of time, the\r\nordinary relation may be assumed. If miscarriage has taken place,\r\nintercourse should be avoided for a month or six weeks at least after\r\nthe accident.\r\n\r\n2. IMPREGNATION.--Impregnation is the only mission of intercourse, and\r\nafter that has taken place, intercourse can subserve no other purpose\r\nthan sensual gratification.\r\n\r\n3. WOMAN MUST JUDGE.--Every man should recognize the fact that\r\nwoman is the sole umpire as to when, how frequent, and under what\r\ncircumstances, connection should take place. Her desires should not\r\nbe ignored, for her likes and dislikes are--as seen in another part\r\nof this book--easily impressed upon the unborn child. If she is strong\r\nand healthy there is no reason why passion should not be gratified\r\nwith moderation and caution during the whole period of pregnancy, but\r\nshe must be the sole judge and her desires supreme.\r\n\r\n4. VOLUNTARY INSTANCES.--No voluntary instances occur through the\r\nentire animal kingdom. All females repel with force and fierceness the\r\napproaches of the male. The human family is the only exception. A man\r\nthat loves his wife, however, will respect her under all circumstances\r\nand recognize her condition and yield to her wishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA PRIVATE WORD TO THE EXPECTANT MOTHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nElizabeth Cady Stanton, in a lecture to ladies, thus strongly states\r\nher views regarding maternity and painless childbirth:\r\n\r\n\"We must educate our daughters to think that motherhood is grand, and\r\nthat God never cursed it. And this curse, if it be a curse, may be\r\nrolled off, as man has rolled away the curse of labor; as the curse\r\nhas been rolled from the descendants of Ham. My mission is to preach\r\nthis new gospel. If you suffer, it is not because you are cursed of\r\nGod, but because you violate His laws. What an incubus it would take\r\nfrom woman could she be educated to know that the pains of maternity\r\nare no curse upon her kind. We know that among the Indians the squaws\r\ndo not suffer in childbirth. They will step aside from the ranks, even\r\non the march, and return in a short time to them with the new-born\r\nchild. What an absurdity then, to suppose that only enlightened\r\nChristian women are cursed. But one word of fact is worth a volume of\r\nphilosophy; let me give you some of my own experience. I am the mother\r\nof seven children. My girlhood was spent mostly in the open air. I\r\nearly imbibed the idea that a girl was just as good as a boy, and I\r\ncarried it out. I would walk five miles before breakfast or ride ten\r\non horseback. After I was married I wore my clothing sensibly. Their\r\nweight hung entirely on my shoulders. I never compressed my body\r\nout of its natural shape. When my first four children were born,\r\nI suffered very little. I then made up my mind that it was totally\r\nunnecessary for me to suffer at all; so I dressed lightly, walked\r\nevery day, lived as much as possible in the open air, ate no\r\ncondiments or spices, kept quiet, listened to music, looked at\r\npictures, and took proper care of myself. The night before the birth\r\nof the child I walked three miles. The child was born without a\r\nparticle of pain. I bathed it and dressed it, and it weighed ten and\r\none-half pounds. That same day I dined with the family. Everybody\r\nsaid I would surely die, but I never had a relapse or a moment's\r\ninconvenience from it. I know this is not being delicate and refined,\r\nbut if you would be vigorous and healthy, in spite of the diseases of\r\nyour ancestors, and your own disregard of nature's laws, try it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSHALL PREGNANT WOMEN WORK?\r\n\r\n\r\n1. OVER-WORKED MOTHERS.--Children born of over-worked mothers, are\r\nliable to a be dwarfed and puny race. However, their chances are\r\nbetter than those of the children of inactive, dependent, indolent\r\nmothers who have neither brain nor muscle to transmit to son or\r\ndaughter. The truth seems to be that excessive labor, with either body\r\nor mind, is alike injurious to both men and women; and herein lies the\r\nsting of that old curse. This paragraph suggests all that need be said\r\non the question whether pregnant women should or should not labor.\r\n\r\n2. FOOLISHLY IDLE.--At least it is certain that they should not be\r\nfoolishly idle; and on the other hand, it is equally certain that they\r\nshould be relieved from painful laborious occupations that exhaust\r\nand unfit them for happiness. Pleasant and useful physical and\r\nintellectual occupation, however, will not only do no harm, but\r\npositive good.\r\n\r\n3. THE BEST MAN AND THE BEST WOMAN.--The best man is he who can rear\r\nthe best child, and the best woman is she who can rear the best child.\r\nWe very properly extol to the skies Harriet Hosmer, the artist, for\r\ncutting in marble the statue of a Zenobia; how much more should we\r\nsing praises to the man and the woman who bring into the world a noble\r\nboy or girl. The one is a piece of lifeless beauty, the other a piece\r\nof life Including all beauty, all possibilities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWORDS FOR YOUNG MOTHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe act of nursing is sometimes painful to the mother, especially\r\nbefore the habit is fully established. The discomfort is greatly\r\nincreased if the skin that covers the nipples is tender and delicate.\r\nThe suction pulls it off leaving them in a state in which the\r\nnecessary pressure of the child's lips cause intense agony. This can\r\nbe prevented in a great measure, says Elizabeth Robinson Scovil, in\r\n_Ladies' Home Journal_, if not entirely, by bathing the nipples\r\ntwice a day for six weeks before the confinement with powdered alum\r\ndissolved in alcohol; or salt dissolved in brandy. If there is any\r\nsymptom of the skin cracking when the child begins; to nurse, they\r\nshould be painted with a mixture of tannin and glycerine. This must\r\nbe washed off before the baby touches them and renewed when it leaves\r\nthem. If they are very painful, the doctor will probably order morphia\r\nadded to the mixture. A rubber nipple shield to be put on at the time\r\nof nursing, is a great relief. If the nipples are retracted or drawn\r\ninward, they can be drawn out painlessly by filling a pint bottle with\r\nboiling water, emptying it and quickly applying the mouth over the\r\nnipple. As the air in the bottle cools, it condenses, leaving a vacuum\r\nand the nipple is pushed out by the air behind it.\r\n\r\nWhen the milk accumulates or \"cakes\" in the breast in hard patches,\r\nthey should be rubbed very gently, from the base upwards, with warm\r\ncamphorated oil. The rubbing should be the lightest, most delicate\r\nstroking, avoiding pressure. If lumps appear at the base of the breast\r\nand it is red swollen and painful, cloths wrung out of cold water\r\nshould be applied and the doctor sent for. While the breast is full\r\nand hard all over, not much apprehension need be felt. It is when\r\nlumps appear that the physician should be notified, that he may, if\r\npossible, prevent the formation of abscesses.\r\n\r\nWhile a woman is nursing she should eat plenty of nourishing\r\nfood--milk, oatmeal, cracked wheat, and good juicy, fresh meat,\r\nboiled, roasted, or broiled, but not fried. Between each meal, before\r\ngoing to bed, and once during the night, she should take a cup of\r\ncocoa, gruel made with milk; good beef tea, mutton broth, or any warm,\r\nnutritive drink. Tea and coffee are to be avoided. It is important\r\nto keep the digestion in order and the bowels should be carefully\r\nregulated as a means to this end. If necessary, any of the laxative\r\nmineral waters can be used for this purpose, or a teaspoonful of\r\ncompound licorice powder taken at night. Powerful cathartic medicines\r\nshould be avoided because of their effect upon the baby. The child\r\nshould be weaned at nine months old, unless this time comes in very\r\nhot weather, or the infant is so delicate that a change of food would\r\nbe injurious. If the mother is not strong her nurseling will sometimes\r\nthrive better upon artificial food than on its natural nourishment. By\r\ngradually lengthening the interval between the nursing and feeding the\r\nchild, when it is hungry, the weaning can be accomplished without much\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nA young mother should wear warm underclothing, thick stockings and\r\na flannel jacket over her night dress, unless she is in the habit of\r\nwearing an under vest. If the body is not protected by warm clothing\r\nthere is an undue demand upon the nervous energy to keep up the vital\r\nheat, and nerve force is wasted by the attempt to compel the system to\r\ndo what ought to be done for it by outside means.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHOW TO HAVE BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. PARENTAL INFLUENCE.--The art of having handsome children has been\r\na question that has interested the people of all ages and of all\r\nnationalities. There is no longer a question as to the influence that\r\nparents may and do exert upon their offspring, and it is shown in\r\nother parts of this book that beauty depends largely on the condition\r\nof health at the time of conception. It is therefore of no little\r\nmoment that parents should guard carefully their own health as well as\r\nthat of their children, that they may develop a vigorous constitution.\r\nThere cannot be beauty without good health.\r\n\r\n2. MARRYING TOO EARLY.--We know that marriage at too early an age, or\r\ntoo late in life, is apt to produce imperfectly developed children,\r\nboth mentally and physically. The causes are self-evident: A couple\r\nmarrying too young, they lack maturity and consequently will impart\r\nweakness to their offspring; while on the other hand persons marrying\r\nlate in life fail to find that normal condition which is conducive to\r\nthe health and vigor of offspring.\r\n\r\n3. CROSSING OF TEMPERAMENTS AND NATIONALITIES.--The Crossing of\r\ntemperaments and nationalities beautifies offspring. If young persons\r\nof different nationalities marry, their children under proper hygienic\r\nlaws are generally handsome and healthy. For instance, an American\r\nand German or an Irish and German uniting in marriage, produces better\r\nlooking children than those marrying in the same nationality. Persons\r\nof different temperaments uniting in marriage, always produces a good\r\neffect upon offspring.\r\n\r\n4. THE PROPER TIME.--To obtain the best results, conception should\r\ntake place only when both parties are in the best physical condition.\r\nIf either parent is in any way indisposed at the time of conception\r\nthe results will be seen in the health of the child. Many children\r\nbrought in the world with diseases or other infirmities stamped upon\r\ntheir feeble frames show the indiscretion and ignorance of parents.\r\n\r\n5. DURING PREGNANCY.--During pregnancy the mother should take time\r\nfor self improvement and cultivate an interest for admiring beautiful\r\npictures or engravings which represent cheerful and beautiful\r\nfigures. Secure a few good books illustrating art, with some fine\r\nrepresentations of statues and other attractive pictures. The purchase\r\nof several illustrated an journals might answer the purpose.\r\n\r\n6. WHAT TO AVOID.--Pregnant mothers should avoid thinking of ugly\r\npeople, or those marked by any deformity or disease; avoid injury,\r\nfright and disease of any kind. Also avoid ungraceful position and\r\nawkward attitude, but cultivate grace and beauty in herself. Avoid\r\ndifficulty with neighbors or other trouble.\r\n\r\n7. GOOD CARE.--She should keep herself in good physical condition, and\r\nthe system well nourished, as a want of food always injures the child.\r\n\r\n8. THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE MIND.--The mother should read suitable\r\narticles in newspapers or good books, keep her mind occupied. If she\r\ncultivates a desire for intellectual improvement, the same desire will\r\nbe more or less manifested in the growth and development of the child.\r\n\r\n9. LIKE PRODUCES LIKE, everywhere and always--in general forms and in\r\nparticular features--in mental qualities and in bodily conditions--in\r\ntendencies of thought and in habits of action. Let this grand truth be\r\ndeeply impressed upon the hearts of all who desire or expect to become\r\nparents.\r\n\r\n10. HEREDITY.--Male children generally inherit the peculiar traits and\r\ndiseases of the mother and female children those of the father.\r\n\r\n11. ADVICE.--Therefore it is urged that during the period of\r\nutero-gestation, especial pains should be taken to render the life of\r\nthe female as harmonious as possible, that her surroundings should\r\nall be of a nature calculated to inspire the mind with thoughts of\r\nphysical and mental beauties and perfections, and that she should\r\nbe guarded against all influences, of whatever character, having a\r\ndeteriorative tendency.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BEAUTIFUL BUTTERFLY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEDUCATION OF THE CHILD IN THE WOMB.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A lady once interviewed a prominent college president and asked him\r\nwhen the education of a child should begin. 'Twenty-five years before\r\nit is born,' was the prompt reply.\"\r\n\r\nNo better answer was ever given to that question Every mother may well\r\nconsider it.\r\n\r\n1. THE UNBORN CHILD AFFECTED BY THE THOUGHTS AND THE SURROUNDINGS OF\r\nTHE MOTHER.--That the child is affected in the womb of the mother,\r\nthrough the influences apparently connected with objects by which she\r\nis surrounded, appears to have been well known in ancient days, as\r\nwell as at the present time.\r\n\r\n2. EVIDENCES.--Many evidences are found in ancient history, especially\r\namong the refined nations, showing that certain expedients\r\nwere resorted to by which their females, during the period of\r\nutero-gestation, were surrounded by the superior refinements of the\r\nage, with the hope of thus making upon them impressions which should\r\nhave the effect of communicating certain desired qualities to the\r\noffspring. For this reason apartments were adorned with statuary and\r\npaintings, and special pains were taken not only to convey favorable\r\nimpressions, but also to guard against unfavorable ones being made,\r\nupon the mind of the pregnant woman.\r\n\r\n3. HANKERING AFTER GIN.--A certain mother while pregnant, longed for\r\ngin, which could not be gotten; and her child cried incessantly for\r\nsix weeks till gin was given it, which it eagerly clutched and drank\r\nwith ravenous greediness, stopped crying, and became healthy.\r\n\r\n4. BEGIN TO EDUCATE CHILDREN AT CONCEPTION, and continue during their\r\nentire carriage. Yet maternal study, of little account before the\r\nsixth, after it, is most promotive of talents; which, next to goodness\r\nare the father's joy and the mother's pride. What pains are taken\r\nafter they are born, to render them prodigies of learning, by the best\r\nof schools and teachers from their third year; whereas their mother's\r\nstudy, three months before their birth, would improve their intellects\r\ninfinitely more.\r\n\r\n5. MOTHERS, DOES GOD THUS PUT the endowment of your darlings into\r\nyour moulding power? Then tremble in view of its necessary\r\nresponsibilities, and learn how to wield them for their and your\r\ntemporal and eternal happiness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n6. QUALITIES OF THE MIND.--The Qualities of the mind are perhaps\r\nas much liable to hereditary transmission as bodily configuration.\r\nMemory, intelligence, judgment, imagination, passions, diseases, and\r\nwhat is usually called genius, are often very markedly traced in the\r\noffspring.--I have known mental impressions forcibly impressed upon\r\nthe offspring at the time of conception, as concomitant of some\r\npeculiar eccentricity, idiosyncrasy, morbidness, waywardness,\r\nirritability, or proclivity of either one or both parents.\r\n\r\n7. THE PLASTIC BRAIN.--The plastic brain of the foetus is prompt\r\nto receive all impressions. It retains them, and they become the\r\ncharacteristics of the child and the man. Low spirits, violent\r\npassions, irritability, frivolity, in the pregnant woman, leave\r\nindelible marks on the unborn child.\r\n\r\n8. FORMATION OF CHARACTER.--I believe that pre-natal influences may\r\ndo as much in the formation of character as all the education that\r\ncan come after, and that mothers may, in a measure, \"will,\" what that\r\ninfluence shall be, and that, as knowledge on the subject increases,\r\nit will be more and more under their control. In that, as in\r\neverything else, things that would be possible with one mother would\r\nnot be with another, and measures that would be successful with one\r\nwould produce opposite results from the other.\r\n\r\n9. A HISTORICAL ILLUSTRATION.--A woman rode side by side with her\r\nsoldier husband, and witnessed the drilling of troops for battle. The\r\nscene inspired her with a deep longing to see a battle and share in\r\nthe excitements of the conquerors. This was but a few months before\r\nher boy was born, and his name was Napoleon.\r\n\r\n10. A MUSICIAN.--The following was reported by Dr. F.W. Moffatt, in\r\nthe mother's own language, \"When I was first pregnant, I wished\r\nmy offspring to be a musician, so, during the period of that\r\npregnancy, settled my whole mind on music, and attended every musical\r\nentertainment I possibly could. I had my husband, who has a violin, to\r\nplay for me by the hour. When the child was born, it was a girl, which\r\ngrew and prospered, and finally became an expert musician.\"\r\n\r\n11. MURDEROUS INTENT.--The mother of a young man, who was hung not\r\nlong ago, was heard to say: \"I tried to get rid of him before he was\r\nborn; and, oh, how I wish now that I had succeeded!\" She added that it\r\nwas the only time she had attempted anything of the sort; but, because\r\nof home troubles, she became desperate, and resolved that her burdens\r\nshould not be made any greater. Does it not seem probable that the\r\nmurderous intent, even though of short duration, was communicated\r\nto the mind of the child, and resulted in the crime for which he was\r\nhung?\r\n\r\n12. THE ASSASSIN OF GARFIELD.--Guiteau's father was a man of integrity\r\nand conquerable intellectual ability. His children were born in quick\r\nsuccession, and the mother was obliged to work very hard. Before this\r\nchild was born, she resorted to every means, though unsuccessful, to\r\nproduce abortion. The world knows the result. Guiteau's whole life\r\nwas full of contradictions. There was little self-controlling power\r\nin him; no common sense, and not a vestige or remorse or shame. In his\r\nwild imagination, he believed himself capable of doing the greatest\r\nwork and of filling the loftiest station in life. Who will dare\r\nquestion that this mother's effort to destroy him while in embryo was\r\nthe main cause in bringing him to the level of the brutes?\r\n\r\n13. CAUTION.--Any attempt, on the part of the mother, to destroy her\r\nchild before birth, is liable, if unsuccessful, to produce murderous\r\ntendencies. Even harboring murderous thoughts, whether toward her own\r\nchild or not, might be followed by similar results.\r\n\r\n  \"The great King of kings\r\n  Hath in the table of His law commanded\r\n  That thou shall do no murder. Wilt thou, then,\r\n  Spurn at His edict, and fulfill a man's?\r\n  Take heed, for He holds vengeance in His hand\r\n  To hurl upon their heads that break his law.\"\r\n  --RICHARD III., _Act I._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Embryo In Sixty Days.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHOW TO CALCULATE THE TIME OF EXPECTED LABOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The table on the opposite page has been very accurately compiled,\r\nand will be very helpful to those who desire the exact time.\r\n\r\n2. The duration of pregnancy is from 278 to 280 days, or nearly\r\nforty weeks. The count should be made from the beginning of the last\r\nmenstruation, and add eight days on account of the possibility of it\r\noccurring within that period. The heavier the child the longer is the\r\nduration; the younger the woman the longer time it often requires. The\r\nduration is longer in married than in unmarried women; the duration is\r\nliable to be longer if the child is a female.\r\n\r\n3. MOVEMENT.--The first movement is generally felt on the 135th day\r\nafter impregnation.\r\n\r\n4. GROWTH OF THE EMBRYO.--About the twentieth day the embryo resembles\r\nthe appearance of an ant or lettuce seed; the 30th day the embryo is\r\nas large as a common horse fly; the 40th day the form resembles that\r\nof a person; in sixty days the limbs begin to form, and in four months\r\nthe embryo takes the name of foetus.\r\n\r\n5. Children born after seven or eight months can survive and develop\r\nto maturity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DURATION OF PREGNANCY.]\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS.--Find in the upper horizontal line the date on which\r\nthe last menstruation ceased; the figure beneath gives the date of\r\nexpected confinement (280 days).\r\n\r\nJan. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15\r\nOct. 8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22\r\n\r\nJan. 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31\r\nOct. 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31  1  2  3  4  5  6  7 Nov.\r\n\r\nFeb. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15\r\nNov. 8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22\r\n\r\nFeb. 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28\r\nNov. 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30  1  2  3  4  5  6  7 Dec.\r\n\r\nMar. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15\r\nDec. 6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\r\n\r\nMar. 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31\r\nDec. 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31  1  2  3  4  5 Jan.\r\n\r\nApr. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15\r\nJan. 6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20\r\n\r\nApr. 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31\r\nJan. 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31  1  2  3  4  5 Feb.\r\n\r\nMay  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15\r\nFeb. 8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22\r\n\r\nMay  16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31\r\nFeb. 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31  1  2  3  4  5  6  7 Mar.\r\n\r\nJune 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15\r\nMar. 8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22\r\n\r\nJune 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30\r\nMar. 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31  1  2  3  4  5  6 Apr.\r\n\r\nJuly 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15\r\nApr. 7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21\r\n\r\nJuly 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30\r\nApr. 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31  1  2  3  4  5 May\r\n\r\nAug. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15\r\nMay  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22\r\n\r\nAug. 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31\r\nMay  23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31  1  2  3  4  5  6  7 June\r\n\r\nSep. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15\r\nJune 8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22\r\n\r\nSep. 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30\r\nJune 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31  1  2  3  4  5  6 July\r\n\r\nOct. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15\r\nJuly 8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22\r\n\r\nOct. 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31\r\nJuly 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31  1  2  3  4  5  6  7 Aug.\r\n\r\nNov. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15\r\nAug. 8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22\r\n\r\nNov. 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30\r\nAug. 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31  1  2  3  4  5  6 Sep.\r\n\r\nDec. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15\r\nSep. 8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22\r\n\r\nDec. 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31\r\nSep. 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31  1  2  3  4  5  6  7 Oct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: If menstruation ceased Oct. 31, the confinement will\r\ntake place July 18.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF LABOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Although the majority of patients, a day or two before the labor\r\ncomes on, are more bright and cheerful, some few are more anxious,\r\nfanciful, fidgety and reckless.\r\n\r\n2. A few days, sometimes a few hours, before labor commences,\r\nthe child \"falls\" as it is called; that is to say, there is a\r\nsubsidence--a dropping--of the womb lower down the abdomen. This\r\nis the reason why she feels lighter and more comfortable, and more\r\ninclined to take exercise, and why she can breathe more freely.\r\n\r\n3. The only inconvenience of the dropping of the womb is, that the\r\nwomb presses more on the bladder, and sometimes causes an irritability\r\nof that organ, inducing a frequent desire to make water. The wearing\r\nthe obstetric belt, as so particularly enjoined in previous pages,\r\nwill greatly mitigate this inconvenience.\r\n\r\n4. The subsidence--the dropping--of the womb may then be considered\r\none of the earliest of the precursory symptoms of child-birth, and as\r\nthe herald of the coming event.\r\n\r\n5. She has, at this time, an increased moisture of the vagina--the\r\npassage leading to the womb--and of the external parts. She has, at\r\nlength, slight pains, and then she has a \"show,\" as it is called;\r\nwhich is the coming away of a mucous plug which, during pregnancy, had\r\nhermetically sealed up the mouth of the womb. The \"show\" is generally\r\ntinged with a little blood. When a \"show\" takes place, she may rest\r\nassured that labor has actually commenced. One of the early symptoms\r\nof labor is a frequent desire to relieve the bladder.\r\n\r\n6. She ought not, on any account, unless it be ordered by the medical\r\nman, to take any stimulant as a remedy for the shivering. In case of\r\nshivering or chills, a cup either of hot lea or of hot gruel will be\r\nthe best remedy for the shivering; and an extra blanket or two\r\nshould be thrown over her, and be well tucked around her, in order to\r\nthoroughly exclude the air from the body. The extra clothing, as soon\r\nas she is warm and perspiring, should be gradually removed, as she\r\nought not to be kept very hot, or it will weaken her, and will thus\r\nretard her labor.\r\n\r\n7. She must not, on any account, force down--as her female friends\r\nor as a \"pottering\" old nurse may advise--to \"grinding pains\"; if sue\r\ndoes, it will rather retard than forward her labor. 8. During this\r\nstage, she had better walk about or sit down, and not confine herself\r\nto bed; indeed, there is no necessity for her, unless she particularly\r\ndesire it, to remain in her chamber.\r\n\r\n9. After an uncertain length of time, the pains alter in character.\r\nFrom being \"grinding\" they become \"bearing down,\" and more regular and\r\nfrequent, and the skin becomes both hot and perspiring. These may be\r\nconsidered the true labor-pains. The patient ought to bear in mind\r\nthen that \"true labor-pains\" are situated in the back, and loins; they\r\ncome on at regular intervals, rise gradually up to a certain pitch of\r\nintensity, and abate as gradually; it is a dull, heavy, deep sort of\r\npain, producing occasionally a low moan from the patient; not sharp or\r\ntwinging, which would elicit a very different expression of suffering\r\nfrom her.\r\n\r\n10. Labor--and truly it maybe called, \"labor.\" The fiat has gone forth\r\nthat in \"sorrow thou shalt bring forth children.\" Young, in his \"Night\r\nThoughts,\" beautifully expresses the common lot of women to suffer:\r\n\r\n  \"'Tis the common lot;\r\n  in this shape, or in that, has fate entailed\r\n  The mother's throes on all of women born,\r\n  Not more the children than sure heirs of pain.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOVE OF HOME.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSPECIAL SAFEGUARDS IN CONFINEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Before the confinement takes place everything should be carefully\r\narranged and prepared. The physician should be spoken to and be given\r\nthe time as near as can be calculated. The arrangement of the bed,\r\nbed clothing, the dress for the mother and the expected babe should be\r\narranged for convenient and immediate use.\r\n\r\n2. A bottle of sweet oil, or vaseline, or some pure lard should be\r\nin readiness. Arrangements should be made for washing all soiled\r\ngarments, and nothing by way of soiled rags or clothing should be\r\nallowed to accumulate.\r\n\r\n3. A rubber blanket, or oil or waterproof cloth should be in readiness\r\nto place underneath the bottom sheet to be used during labor.\r\n\r\n4. As soon as labor pains have begun a fire should be built and hot\r\nwater kept ready for immediate use. The room should be kept well\r\nventilated and comfortably warm.\r\n\r\n5. No people should be allowed in or about the room except the nurse,\r\nthe physician, and probably members of the family when called upon to\r\nperform some duty.\r\n\r\n6. During labor no solid food should be taken; a little milk, broth or\r\nsoup may be given, provided there is an appetite. Malt or spirituous\r\nliquors should be carefully avoided. A little wine, however, may be\r\ntaken in case of great exhaustion. Lemonade, toast, rice water, and\r\ntea may be given when desired. Warm tea is considered an excellent\r\ndrink for the patient at this time.\r\n\r\n7. When the pains become regular and intermit, it is time that the\r\nphysician is sent for. On the physician's arrival he will always take\r\ncharge of the case and give necessary instructions.\r\n\r\n8. In nearly all cases the head of the child is presented first. The\r\nfirst pains are generally grinding and irregular, and felt mostly in\r\nthe groins and within, but as labor progresses the pains are felt in\r\nthe abdomen, and as the head advances there is severe pain in the back\r\nand hips and a disposition to bear down, but no pressure should be\r\nplaced upon the abdomen of the patient; it is often the cause of\r\nserious accidents. Nature will take care of itself.\r\n\r\n9. Conversation should be of a cheerful character, and all allusions\r\nto accidents of other child births should be carefully avoided.\r\n\r\n10. ABSENCE OF PHYSICIAN.--In case the child should be born in the\r\nabsence of the physician, when the head is born receive it in the hand\r\nand support it until the shoulders have been expelled, and steady the\r\nwhole body until the child is born. Support the child with both hands\r\nand lay it as far from the mother as possible without stretching the\r\ncord. Remove the mucus from the nostrils and mouth, wrap the babe in\r\nwarm flannel, make the mother comfortable, give her a drink, and allow\r\nthe child to remain until the pulsations in the cord have entirely\r\nceased. After the pulsations have entirely ceased then sever the cord.\r\nUse a dull pair of scissors, cutting it about two inches from the\r\nchild's navel, and generally no time is necessary, and when the\r\nphysician comes he will give it prompt attention.\r\n\r\n11. If the child does not breathe at its arrival, says Dr. Stockham in\r\nher celebrated Tokology, a little slapping on the breast and body will\r\noften produce respiration, and if this is not efficient, dash cold\r\nwater on the face and chest; if this fails then close the nostrils\r\nwith two fingers, breathe into the mouth and then expel the air from\r\nthe lungs by gentle pressure upon the chest. Continue this as long as\r\nany hope of life remains.\r\n\r\n12. AFTER-BIRTH.--Usually contractions occur and the after-birth is\r\nreadily expelled; if not, clothes wrung out in hot water laid upon\r\nthe bowels will often cause the contraction of the uterus, and the\r\nexpulsion of the after-birth.\r\n\r\n13. If the cord bleeds severely inject cold water into it. This in\r\nmany cases removes the after-birth.\r\n\r\n14. After the birth of the child give the patient a bath, if the\r\npatient is not too exhausted, change the soiled quilts and clothing,\r\nfix up everything neat and clean and let the patient rest.\r\n\r\n15 Let the patient drink weak tea, gruel, cold or hot water, whichever\r\nshe chooses.\r\n\r\n16. After the birth of the baby, the mother should be kept perfectly\r\nquiet for the first 24 hours and not allowed to talk or see anyone\r\nexcept her nearest relations, however well she may seem. She should\r\nnot get out of bed for ten days or two weeks, nor sit up in bed for\r\nnine days. The more care taken of her at this time, the more rapid\r\nwill be her recovery when she does get about. She should go up and\r\ndown stairs slowly, carefully, and as seldom as possible for six\r\nweeks. She should not stand more than is unavoidable during that time,\r\nbut sit with her feet up and lie down when she has time to rest.\r\nShe should not work a sewing machine with a treadle for at least six\r\nweeks, and avoid any unusual strain or over-exertion. \"An ounce of\r\nprevention IS worth a pound of cure,\" and carefulness will be well\r\nrepaid by a perfect restoration to health.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MY PRICELESS JEWEL.

AILMENTS.--Those ailments to which pregnant women are liable are\r\nmostly inconveniences rather than diseases, although they may be\r\naggravated to a degree of danger. No patent nostrums or prescriptions\r\nare necessary. If there is any serious difficulty the family physician\r\nshould be consulted.\r\n\r\n2. COMFORT.--Wealth and luxuries are not a necessity. Comfort will\r\nmake the surroundings pleasant. Drudgery, overwork and exposure are\r\nthe three things that tend to make women miserable while in the state\r\nof pregnancy, and invariably produce irritable, fretful and feeble\r\nchildren. Dr. Stockham says in her admirable work \"Tokology:\" \"The\r\nwoman who indulges in the excessive gayety of fashionable life, as\r\nwell as the overworked woman, deprives her child of vitality.\r\nShe attends parties in a dress that is unphysiological in warmth,\r\ndistribution and adjustment, in rooms badly ventilated; partakes of\r\na supper of indigestible compounds, and remains into the 'wee, sma'\r\nhours,' her nervous system taxed to the utmost.\"\r\n\r\n3. EXERCISE.--A goodly amount of moderate exercise is a necessity,\r\nand a large amount of work may be accomplished if prudence is properly\r\nexercised. It is overwork, and the want of sufficient rest and sleep\r\nthat produces serious results.\r\n\r\n4. DRESSES.--A pregnant woman should make her dresses of light\r\nmaterial and avoid surplus trimmings. Do not wear anything that\r\nproduces any unnecessary weight. Let the clothing be light but\r\nsufficient in quantity to produce comfort in all kinds of weather.\r\n\r\n5. GARMENTS.--It is well understood that the mother must breathe\r\nfor two, and in order to dress healthily the garments should be worn\r\nloose, so as to give plenty of room for respiration. Tight clothes\r\nonly cause disease, or produce frailty or malformation in the\r\noffspring.\r\n\r\n6. SHOES.--Wear a large shoe in pregnancy; the feet may swell and\r\nuntold discomfort may be the result. Get a good large shoe with a\r\nlarge sole. Give the feet plenty of room. Many women suffer from\r\ndefects in vision, indigestion, backache, loss of voice, headache,\r\netc., simply as the result of the reflex action of the pressure of\r\ntight shoes.\r\n\r\n7. LACING.--Many women lace themselves to the first period of their\r\ngestation in order to meet their society engagements. All of this is\r\nvitally wrong and does great injury to the unborn child as well as to\r\ninflict many ills and pains upon the mother.\r\n\r\n8. CORSETS.--Corsets should be carefully avoided, for the corset more\r\nthan any other one thing is responsible for making woman the victim\r\nof more woes and diseases than all other causes put together. About\r\none-half the children born in this country die before they are five\r\nyears of age, and no doubt this terrible mortality is largely due to\r\nthis instrument of torture known as the _modern corset._ Tight lacing\r\nis the cause of infantile mortality. It slowly but surely takes the\r\nlives of tens of thousands, and so effectually weakens and diseases,\r\nso as to cause the untimely death of millions more.\r\n\r\n9. BATHING.--Next to godliness is cleanliness. A pregnant woman should\r\ntake a sponge or towel-bath two or three times a week. It stimulates\r\nand invigorates the entire body. No more than two or three minutes\r\nare required. It should be done in a warm room, and the body rubbed\r\nthoroughly after each bathing.\r\n\r\n10. THE HOT SITZ-BATH.--This bath is one of the most desirable and\r\nhealthful baths for pregnant women. It will relieve pain or acute\r\ninflammation, and will be a general tonic in keeping the system in\r\na good condition. This may be taken in the middle of the forenoon or\r\njust before retiring, and if taken just before retiring will produce\r\ninvigorating sleep, will quiet the nerves, cure headache, weariness,\r\netc. It is a good plan to take this bath every night before retiring\r\nin case of any disorders. A woman who keeps this tip during the period\r\nof gestation will have a very easy labor and a strong, vigorous babe.\r\n\r\n11. HOT FOMENTATIONS.--Applying flannel cloths wrung out of simple\r\nor medicated hot water is a great relief for acute suffering, such as\r\nneuralgia, rheumatic pain, biliousness, constipation, torpid liver,\r\ncolic, flatulency, etc.\r\n\r\n12. THE HOT WATER-BAG.--The hot water-bag serves the same purpose\r\nas hot fomentations, and is much more convenient. No one should go\r\nthrough the period of gestation without a hot water-bag.\r\n\r\n13. THE COLD COMPRESS.--This is a very desirable and effectual\r\ndomestic remedy. Take a towel wrung from cold water and apply it\r\nto the affected parts; then cover well with several thicknesses\r\nof flannel. This is excellent in cases of sore throat, hoarseness,\r\nbronchitis, inflammation of the lungs, croup, etc. It is also\r\nexcellent for indigestion, constipation or distress of the bowels\r\naccompanied by heat.\r\n\r\n14. DIET.--The pregnant woman should eat nutritious, but not\r\nstimulating or heating food, and eat at the regular time. Avoid\r\ndrinking much while eating.\r\n\r\n15. AVOID salt, pepper and sweets as much as possible.\r\n\r\n16. EAT all kinds of grains, vegetables and fruits, and avoid salted\r\nmeat, but eat chicken, steak, fish, oysters, etc.\r\n\r\n17. THE WOMAN WHO EATS INDISCRIMINATELY anything and everything the\r\nsame as any other person, will have a very painful labor and suffer\r\nmany ills that could easily be avoided by more attention being paid to\r\nthe diet. With a little study and observation a woman will soon learn\r\nwhat to eat and what to avoid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Nature Versus Corsets Illustrated_\r\n\r\nA.

The ribs bent almost to angles; the lungs contracted; the liver,\r\nstomach and intestines forced down into the pelvis, crowding the womb\r\nseriously.]\r\n\r\n18. The above cuts are given on page 113; we repeat them here for the\r\nbenefit of expectant mothers who may be ignorant of the evil effects\r\nof the corset.\r\n\r\nDisplacement of the womb, interior irritation and inflammation,\r\nmiscarriage and sterility, are some of the many injuries of tight\r\nlacing. There are many others, in fact their name is legion, and every\r\nwoman who has habitually worn a corset and continues to wear it during\r\nthe early period of gestation must suffer severely during childbirth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _\"The House We Live In\" for nine months: showing\r\nthe ample room provided by Nature when uncontracted by inherited\r\ninferiority of form or artificial dressing._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A Contracted Pelvis. Deformity and Insufficient\r\nSpace._]\r\n\r\n19. THIS IS WHAT DR. STOCKHAM says: \"If women had _common sense_,\r\ninstead of _fashion sense_, the corset would not exist. There are\r\nnot words in the English language to express my convictions upon this\r\nsubject. The corset more than any other one thing is responsible for\r\nwoman's being the victim of disease and doctors....\r\n\r\n\"What is the effect upon the child? One-half of the children born in\r\nthis country die before they are five years of age. Who can tell how\r\nmuch this state of things is due to the enervation of maternal life\r\nforces by the one instrument of torture?\r\n\r\n\"I am a temperance woman. No one can realize more than I the\r\ndevastation and ruin alcohol in its many tempting forms has brought\r\nto the human family. Still I solemnly believe that in weakness and\r\ndeterioration of health, the corset has more to answer for than\r\nintoxicating drinks.\" When asked how far advanced a woman should be\r\nin pregnancy before she laid aside her corset, Dr. Stockham said with\r\nemphasis: \"_The corset should not be worn for two hundred years before\r\npregnancy takes place._ Ladies, it will take that time at least\r\nto overcome the ill-effect of tight garments which you think so\r\nessential.\"\r\n\r\n20. PAINLESS PREGNANCY AND CHILD-BIRTH.--\"Some excellent popular\r\nvolumes,\" says Dr. Haff, \"have been largely devoted to directions how\r\nto secure a comfortable period of pregnancy and painless delivery.\r\nAfter much conning of these worthy efforts to impress a little common\r\nsense upon the sisterhood, we are convinced that all may be summed\r\nup under the simple heads of: (1) An unconfined and lightly burdened\r\nwaist; (2) Moderate but persistent outdoor exercise, of which walking\r\nis the best form; (3) A plain unstimulating, chiefly fruit and\r\nvegetable diet; (4) Little or no intercourse during the time.\r\n\r\n\"These are hygienic rules of benefit under any ordinary conditions;\r\nyet they are violated by almost every pregnant lady. If they are\r\nfollowed, biliousness, indigestion, constipation, swollen limbs,\r\nmorning sickness and nausea--all will absent themselves or be much\r\nlessened. In pregnancy more than at any other time, corsets are\r\ninjurious. The waist and abdomen must be allowed to expand freely with\r\nthe growth of the child. The great process of _evolution_ must have\r\nroom.\"\r\n\r\n21. IN ADDITION, we can do no better than quote the following\r\nrecapitulation by Dr. Stockham in her famous Tokology: \"To give a\r\nwoman the greatest immunity from suffering during pregnancy, prepare\r\nher for a safe and comparatively easy delivery, and insure a speedy\r\nrecovery, all hygienic conditions must be observed.\r\n\r\n\"The dress must give:\r\n\r\n\"1. Freedom of movement;\r\n\r\n\"2. No pressure upon any part of the body;\r\n\r\n\"3. No more weight than is essential for warmth, and both weight and\r\nwarmth evenly distributed.\r\n\r\n\"These requirements necessitate looseness, lightness and warmth, which\r\ncan be obtained from the union underclothes, a princess skirt and\r\ndress, with a shoe that allows full development and use of the foot.\r\nWhile decoration and elegance are desirable, they should not sacrifice\r\ncomfort and convenience.\r\n\r\n22. \"LET THE DIET BE LIGHT, plain and nutritious. Avoid fats and\r\nsweets, relying mainly upon fruits and grain that contain little of\r\nthe mineral salts. By this diet bilious and inflammatory conditions\r\nare overcome, the development of bone in the foetus lessened, and\r\nmuscles necessary in labor nourished and strengthened.\r\n\r\n23. \"EXERCISE should be sufficient and of such a character as\r\nwill bring into action gently every muscle of the body; but must\r\nparticularly develop the muscles of the trunk, abdomen and groin, that\r\nare specially called into action in labor. Exercise, taken faithfully\r\nand systematically, more than any other means assists assimilative\r\nprocesses and stimulates the organs of excretion to healthy action.\r\n\r\n24. \"BATHING MUST BE FREQUENT and regular. Unless in special\r\nconditions the best results are obtained from tepid or cold bathing,\r\nwhich invigorates the system and overcomes nervousness. The sitz-bath\r\nis the best therapeutic and hygienic measure within the reach of the\r\npregnant woman.\r\n\r\n\"Therefore, to establish conditions which will overcome many previous\r\ninfractions of law, _dress_ naturally and physiologically; _live_ much\r\nof the time _out of doors_; have _abundance_ of _fresh air_ in the\r\nhouse; let _exercise_ be _sufficient_ and _systematic_; pursue a _diet\r\nof fruit_, rice and vegetables; _regular rest_ must be faithfully\r\ntaken; _abstain_ from the sexual relation. To those who will commit\r\nthemselves to this course of life, patiently and persistently carrying\r\nit out through the period of gestation, the possibilities of attaining\r\na healthy, natural, painless parturition will be remarkably increased.\r\n\r\n25. \"IF THE FIRST EXPERIMENT should not result in a painless labor, it\r\nwithout doubt will prove the beginning of sound health. Persisted in\r\nthrough years of married life, the ultimate result will be more and\r\nmore closely approximated, while there will be less danger of diseases\r\nafter childbirth and better and more vigorous children will be\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n\"Then pregnancy by every true woman will be desired, and instead of\r\nbeing a period of disease, suffering and direful forebodings, will\r\nbecome a period of health, exalted pleasure and holiest anticipations.\r\nMotherhood will be deemed the choicest of earth's blessings; women\r\nwill rejoice in a glad maternity and for any self-denial will be\r\ncompensated by healthy, happy, buoyant, grateful children.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SWAT THE FLIES AND SAVE THE BABIES.

EXCESSIVE PLEASURES AND PAINS.--A woman during her time of pregnancy\r\nshould of all women be most carefully tended, and kept from violent\r\nand excessive pleasures and pains; and at that time she should\r\ncultivate gentleness, benevolence and kindness.\r\n\r\n2. HEREDITARY EFFECTS.--Those who are born to become insane do not\r\nnecessarily spring from insane parents, or from any ancestry having\r\nany apparent taint of lunacy in their blood, but they do receive from\r\ntheir progenitors certain impressions upon their mental and moral, as\r\nwell as their physical beings, which impressions, like an iron mould,\r\nfix and shape their subsequent destinies. Hysteria in the mother may\r\ndevelop insanity in the child, while drunkenness in the father may\r\nimpel epilepsy, or mania, in the son. Ungoverned passions in the\r\nparents may unloose the furies of unrestrained madness in the minds of\r\ntheir children, and the bad treatment of the wife may produce sickly\r\nor weak-minded children.\r\n\r\n3. The influence of predominant passion may be transmitted from the\r\nparent to the child, just as surely a similarity of looks. It has been\r\ntruly said that \"the faculties which predominate in power and activity\r\nin the parents, when the organic existence of the child commences,\r\ndetermine its future mental disposition.\" A bad mental condition of\r\nthe mother may produce serious defects upon her unborn child.\r\n\r\n4. The singular effects produced on the unborn child by the sudden\r\nmental emotions of the mother are remarkable examples of a kind\r\nof electrotyping on the sensitive surfaces of living forms. It is\r\ndoubtless true that the mind's action in such cases may increase or\r\ndiminish the molecular deposits in the several portions of the system.\r\nThe precise place which each separate particle assumes in the new\r\norganic structure may be determined by the influence of thought or\r\nfeeling. Perfect love and perfect harmony should exist between wife\r\nand husband during this vital period.\r\n\r\n5. AN ILLUSTRATION.--If a sudden and powerful emotion of a woman's mind\r\nexerts such an influence upon her stomach as to excite vomiting, and\r\nupon her heart as almost to arrest its motion and induce fainting, can\r\nwe believe that it will have no effect upon her womb and the fragile\r\nbeing contained within it? Facts and reason then, alike demonstrate\r\nthe reality of the influence, and much practical advantage would\r\nresult to both parent and child, were the conditions and extent of its\r\noperations better understood.\r\n\r\n6. Pregnant women should not be exposed to causes likely to distress\r\nor otherwise strongly impress their minds. A consistent life with\r\nworthy objects constantly kept in mind should be the aim and purpose\r\nof every expectant mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTEN HEALTH RULES FOR BABIES CUT DEATH RATE IN TWO.\r\n\r\n\r\nNinety-four babies out of every thousand born in New York died last\r\nyear. Only thirty-eight babies died in Montclair, N.J., out of every\r\nthousand born during the same period. Much credit for this low rate of\r\ninfant mortality in the latter city is given the Montclair Day Nursery\r\nwhich prescribes the following decade of baby health rules:\r\n\r\n1. Give a baby pure milk and watch its feeding very closely.\r\n\r\n2. Keep everything connected with a baby absolutely clean. Cleanliness\r\nin the house accounts for a baby's health. Untidy babies are usually\r\nsick babies.\r\n\r\n3. Never let a baby get chilled. Keep its hands and feet warm.\r\n\r\n4. Regulate a baby's day by the clock. Everything about its wants\r\nshould be attended to on schedule time.\r\n\r\n5. Diminish a baby's food the minute signs of illness appear. Most\r\nbabies are overfed anyway.\r\n\r\n6. Weigh a baby every week until it is a year old. Its weight is an\r\nindex of its health.\r\n\r\n7. Every mother should get daily out-door exercise. It means better\r\nhealth for her babies.\r\n\r\n8. Every baby should be \"mothered\" more and mauled less. Babies thrive\r\non cuddling but they can get along on a lot less kissing.\r\n\r\n9. Don't amuse or play with your baby too much. Its regular daily\r\nroutine is all the stimulation its little brain needs at first.\r\n\r\n10. Don't let too many different people take care of the baby. Even\r\nmembers of the same family make a baby nervous if they fuss around him\r\ntoo much.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAN WITH SCALES AND INFANT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE CARE OF NEW-BORN INFANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The first thing to be done ordinarily is to give the little\r\nstranger a bath by using soap and warm water. To remove the white\r\nmaterial that usually covers the child use olive oil, goose oil or\r\nlard, and apply it with a soft piece of worn flannel, and when the\r\nchild is entirely clean rub all off with a fresh piece of flannel.\r\n\r\n2. Many physicians in the United States recommend a thorough oiling\r\nof the child with pure lard or olive oil, and then rub dry as above\r\nstated. By these means water is avoided, and with it much risk of\r\ntaking cold.\r\n\r\n3. The application of brandy or liquor is entirely unnecessary, and\r\ngenerally does more injury than good.\r\n\r\n4. If an infant should breathe feebly, or exhibit other signs of great\r\nfeebleness, it should not be washed at once, but allowed to remain\r\nquiet and undisturbed, warmly wrapped up until the vital actions have\r\nacquired a fair degree of activity.\r\n\r\n5. DRESSING THE NAVEL.--There is nothing better for dressing the navel\r\nthan absorbent antiseptic cotton. There needs be no grease or oil\r\nupon the cotton. After the separation of the cord the navel should be\r\ndressed with a little cosmoline, still using the absorbent cotton. The\r\nnavel string usually separates in a week's time; it may be delayed for\r\ntwice this length of time, this will make no material difference, and\r\nthe rule is to allow it to drop off of its own accord.\r\n\r\n6. THE CLOTHING OF THE INFANT.--The clothing of the infant should be\r\nlight, soft and perfectly loose. A soft flannel band is necessary only\r\nuntil the navel is healed. Afterwards discard bands entirely if you\r\nwish your babe to be happy and well. Make the dresses \"Mother Hubbard\"\r\nPut on first a soft woolen shirt, then prepare the flannel skirts to\r\nhang from the neck like a slip. Make one kind with sleeves and one\r\njust like it without sleeves, then white muslin skirts (if they are\r\ndesired), all the same way. Then baby is ready for any weather. In\r\nintense heat simply put on the one flannel slip with sleeves, leaving\r\noff the shirt. In Spring and Fall the shirt and skirt with no sleeves.\r\nIn Cold weather shirt and both skirts. These garments can be all put\r\non at once, thus making the process of dressing very quick and easy.\r\nThese are the most approved modern styles for dressing infants, and\r\nwith long cashmere stockings pinned to the diapers the little feet\r\nare free to kick with no old-fashioned pinning blanket to torture the\r\nnaturally active, healthy child, and retard its development. If\r\ntight bands are an injury to grown people, then in the name of pity\r\nemancipate the poor little infant from their torture!\r\n\r\n7. THE DIAPER.--Diapers should be of soft linen, and great care should\r\nbe exercised not to pin them too tightly. Never dry them, but always\r\nwash them thoroughly before being used again.\r\n\r\n8. The band need not be worn after the navel has healed so that it\r\nrequires no dressing, as it serves no purpose save to keep in place\r\nthe dressing of the navel. The child's body should be kept thoroughly\r\nwarm around the chest, bowels and feet. Give the heart and lungs\r\nplenty of room to heave.\r\n\r\n9. The proper time for shortening the clothes is about three months in\r\nSummer and six months in Winter.\r\n\r\n10. INFANT BATHING.--The first week of a child's life it should not be\r\nentirely stripped and washed. It is too exhausting. After a child is\r\nover a week old it should be bathed every day; after a child is three\r\nweeks old it may be put in the water and supported with one hand while\r\nit is being washed with the other. Never, however, allow it to remain\r\ntoo long in the water. From ten to twenty minutes is the limit. Use\r\nPears' soap or castile soap, and with a sponge wipe quickly, or use a\r\nsoft towel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNURSING.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The new-born infant requires only the mother's milk. The true\r\nmother will nurse her child if it is a possibility. The infant will\r\nthrive better and have many more chances for life.\r\n\r\n2. The mother's milk is the natural food, and nothing can fully\r\ntake its place. It needs no feeding for the first few days as it\r\nwas commonly deemed necessary a few years ago. The secretions in the\r\nmother's breast are sufficient.\r\n\r\n3. Artificial Food. Tokology says: \"The best artificial food is cream\r\nreduced and sweetened with sugar of mill. Analysis shows that human\r\nmilk contains more cream and sugar and less casein than the milk of\r\nanimals.\"\r\n\r\n4. Milk should form the basis of all preparations of food. If the\r\nmilk is too strong, indigestion will follow, and the child will lose\r\ninstead of gaining strength.\r\n\r\nWEANING.--The weaning of the child depends much upon the strength and\r\ncondition of the mother. If it does not occur in hot weather, from\r\nnine to twelve months is as long as any child should be nursed.\r\n\r\nFOOD IN WEANING.--Infants cry a great deal during weaning, but a few\r\ndays of patient perseverance will overcome all difficulties. Give the\r\nchild purely a milk diet, Graham bread, milk crackers and milk, or a\r\nlittle milk thickened with boiled rice, a little jelly, apple sauce,\r\netc., may be safely used. Cracked wheat, oatmeal, wheat germ, or\r\nanything of that kind thoroughly cooked and served with a little cream\r\nand sugar, is an excellent food.\r\n\r\nMILK DRAWN FROM THE BREASTS.--If the mother suffers considerably from\r\nthe milk gathering in the breast after weaning the child, withdraw it\r\nby taking a bottle that holds about a pint or a quart, putting a piece\r\nof cloth wrung out in warm water around the bottle, then fill it with\r\nboiling water, pour the water out and apply the bottle to the breast,\r\nand the bottle cooling will form a vacuum and will withdraw the milk\r\ninto the bottle. This is one of the best methods now in use.\r\n\r\nRETURN OF THE MENSES.--If the menses return while the mother is\r\nnursing, the child should at once be weaned, for the mother's milk\r\nno longer contains sufficient nourishment. In case the mother should\r\nbecome pregnant while the child is nursing it should at once be\r\nweaned, or serious results will follow to the health of the child. A\r\nmother's milk is no longer sufficiently rich to nourish the child or\r\nkeep it in good health.\r\n\r\nCARE OF THE BOTTLE.--If the child is fed on the bottle great care\r\nshould be taken in keeping it absolutely clean. Never use white\r\nrubber nipples. A plain form of bottle with a black rubber nipple is\r\npreferable.\r\n\r\nCHILDREN should not be permitted to come to the table until two years\r\nof age.\r\n\r\nCHAFING.--One of the best remedies is powdered lycopodium; apply it\r\nevery time the babe is cleaned; but first wash with pure castile\r\nsoap; Pears' soap is also good. A preparation of oxide of zinc is also\r\nhighly recommended. Chafing sometimes results from an acid condition\r\nof the stomach; in that case give a few doses of castoria.\r\n\r\nCOLIC.--If an infant is seriously troubled with colic, there is nothing\r\nbetter than camomile or catnip tea. Procure the leaves and make tea\r\nand give it as warm as the babe can bear.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFEEDING INFANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The best food for infants is mother's milk; next best is cow's\r\nmilk. Cow's milk contains about three times as much curd and one-half\r\nas much sugar, and it should be reduced with two parts of water.\r\n\r\n2. In feeding cow's milk there is too little cream and too little\r\nsugar, and there is no doubt no better preparation than Mellin's food\r\nto mix it with (according to directions).\r\n\r\n3. Children being fed on food lacking fat generally have their teeth\r\ncome late; their muscles will be flabby and bones soft. Children will\r\nbe too fat when their food contains too much sugar. Sugar always makes\r\ntheir flesh soft and flabby.\r\n\r\n4. During the first two months the baby should be fed every two hours\r\nduring the day, and two or three times during the night, but no more.\r\nTen or eleven feedings for twenty-four hours are all a child will bear\r\nand remain healthy. At three months the child may be fed every three\r\nhours instead of every two.\r\n\r\n5. Children can be taught regular habits by being fed and put to sleep\r\nat the same time every day and evening. Nervous diseases are caused by\r\nirregular hours of sleep and diet, and the use of soothing medicines.\r\n\r\n6. A child five or six months old should not be fed during the night\r\nfrom nine in the evening until six or seven in the morning, as\r\noverfeeding causes most of the wakefulness and nervousness of children\r\nduring the night.\r\n\r\n7. If a child vomits soon after taking the bottle, and there is\r\nan appearance of undigested food in the stool, it is a sign of\r\noverfeeding. If a large part of the bottle has been vomited, avoid the\r\nnext bottle at regular time and pass over one bottle. If the child is\r\nnursing the same principles apply.\r\n\r\n8. If a child empties its bottle and sucks vigorously its fingers\r\nafter the bottle is emptied, it is very evident that the child is not\r\nfed enough, and should have its food gradually increased.\r\n\r\n9. Give the baby a little cold water several times a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nINFANTILE CONVULSIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--An infantile convulsion corresponds to a chill in an\r\nadult, and is the most common brain affection among children.\r\n\r\nCAUSES.--Anything that irritates the nervous system may cause\r\nconvulsions in the child, as teething, indigestible food, worms,\r\ndropsy of the brain, hereditary constitution, or they may be the\r\naccompanying symptom in nearly all the acute diseases of children, or\r\nwhen the eruption is suppressed in eruptive diseases.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--In case of convulsions of a child parents usually become\r\nfrightened, and very rarely do the things that should be done in\r\norder to afford relief. The child, previous to the fit, is usually\r\nirritable, and the twitching of the muscles of the face may be\r\nnoticed, or it may come on suddenly without warning. The child becomes\r\ninsensible, clenches its hands tightly, lips turn blue, and the eyes\r\nbecome fixed, usually frothing from the mouth with head turned back.\r\nThe convulsion generally lasts two or three minutes; sometimes,\r\nhowever, as long as ten or fifteen minutes, but rarely.\r\n\r\nREMEDY.--Give the child a warm bath and rub gently. Clothes wrung out\r\nof cold water and applied to the lower and back part of the head and\r\nplenty of fresh air will usually relieve the convulsion. Be sure and\r\nloosen the clothing around the child's neck. After the convulsion is\r\nover, give the child a few doses of potassic bromide, and an injection\r\nof castor oil if the abdomen is swollen. Potassic bromide should be\r\nkept in the house, to use in case of necessity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POOR CHILDREN FROM TENEMENT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPAINS AND ILLS IN NURSING.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. SORE NIPPLES.--If a lady, during the latter few months of her\r\npregnancy, where to adopt \"means to harden the nipples,\" sore nipples\r\nduring the period of suckling would not be so prevalent as they are.\r\n\r\n2. CAUSE.--A sore nipple is frequently produced by the injudicious\r\ncustom of allowing the child to have the nipple almost constantly in\r\nhis mouth. Another frequent cause of a sore nipple is from the babe\r\nhaving the canker. Another cause of a sore nipple is from the mother,\r\nafter the babe has been sucking, putting up the nipple wet. She,\r\ntherefore, ought always to dry the nipple, not by rubbing, but by\r\ndabbing it with a soft cambric or lawn handkerchief, or with a piece\r\nof soft linen rag one or the other of which ought always to be at hand\r\nevery time directly after the child has done sucking, and just before\r\napplying any of the following powders or lotions to the nipple.\r\n\r\n3. REMEDIES.--One of the best remedies for a sore nipple is the\r\nfollowing powder:\r\n\r\n  Take of Borax, one drachm;\r\n  Powdered Starch, seven drachms.\r\n\r\nMix. A pinch of the powder to be frequently applied to the nipple.\r\n\r\nIf the above does not cure, try Glycerine by applying it each time\r\nafter nursing.\r\n\r\n4. GATHERED BREAST.--A healthy woman with a well-developed breast and\r\na good nipple, scarcely, if ever, has a gathered bosom; it is the\r\ndelicate, the ill-developed breasted and worse-developed nippled lady\r\nwho usually suffers from this painful complaint. And why? The evil can\r\ngenerally be traced to girlhood. If she be brought up luxuriously, her\r\nhealth and her breasts are sure to be weakened, and thus to suffer,\r\nmore especially if the development of the bosoms and nipples has been\r\narrested and interfered with by tight stays and corsets. Why, the\r\nnipple is by them drawn in, and retained on the level with the\r\nbreast countersunk as though it were of no consequence to her future\r\nwell-being, as though it were a thing of nought.\r\n\r\n5. TIGHT LACERS.--Tight lacers will have to pay the penalties of which\r\nthey little dream. Oh, the monstrous folly of such proceedings! When\r\nwill mothers awake from their lethargy? It is high time that they did\r\nso! From the mother having \"no nipple,\" the effects of tight lacing,\r\nmany a home has been made childless, the babe not being able to\r\nprocure its proper nourishment, and dying in consequence! It is a\r\nfrightful state of things! But fashion, unfortunately, blinds the eyes\r\nand deafens the ears of its votaries!\r\n\r\n6. BAD BREAST.--A gathered bosom, or \"bad breast,\" as it is sometimes\r\ncalled, is more likely to occur after a first confinement and during\r\nthe first month. Great care, therefore, ought to be taken to avoid\r\nsuch a misfortune. A gathered breast is frequently owing to the\r\ncarelessness of a mother in not covering her bosoms during the time\r\nshe is suckling. Too much attention cannot be paid to keeping the\r\nbreasts comfortably warm. This, during the act of nursing, should be\r\ndone by throwing either a shawl or a square of flannel over the neck,\r\nshoulders, and bosoms.\r\n\r\n7. ANOTHER CAUSE.--Another cause of gathered breasts arises from a\r\nmother sitting up in bed to suckle her babe. He ought to be accustomed\r\nto take the bosom while she is lying down; if this habit is not at\r\nfirst instituted, it will be difficult to adopt it afterwards. Good\r\nhabits may be taught a child from earliest babyhood.\r\n\r\n8. FAINTNESS.--When a nursing mother feels faint, she ought immediately\r\nto lie down and take a little nourishment; a cup of tea with the yolk\r\nof an egg beaten up in it, or a cup of warm milk, or some beef-tea,\r\nany of which will answer the purpose extremely well. Brandy, or any\r\nother spirit we would not recommend, as it would only cause, as soon\r\nas the immediate effects of the stimulant had gone off, a greater\r\ndepression to ensue; not only so, but the frequent taking of brandy\r\nmight become a habit a necessity which would be a calamity deeply to\r\nbe deplored!\r\n\r\n9. STRONG PURGATIVES.--Strong purgatives during this period are highly\r\nimproper, as they are apt to give pain to the infant, as well as to\r\ninjure the mother. If it be absolutely necessary to give physic, the\r\nmildest, such as a dose of castor oil, should be chosen.\r\n\r\n10. HABITUALLY COSTIVE.--When a lady who is nursing is habitually\r\ncostive, she ought to eat brown instead of white bread. This will, in\r\nthe majority of cases, enable her to do without an aperient. The brown\r\nbread may be made with flour finely ground all one way; or by mixing\r\none part of bran and three parts of fine wheaten flour together, and\r\nthen making it in the usual way into bread. Treacle instead of butter,\r\non the brown bread increases its efficacy as an aperient; and raw\r\nshould be substituted for lump sugar in her tea.\r\n\r\n11. TO PREVENT CONSTIPATION.--Stewed prunes, or stewed French plums,\r\nor stewed Normandy pippins, are excellent remedies to prevent\r\nconstipation. The patient ought to eat, every morning, a dozen or\r\nfifteen of them. The best way to stew either prunes or French plums,\r\nis the following: Put a pound of either prunes or French plums, and\r\ntwo tablespoonfuls of raw sugar, into a brown jar; cover them with\r\nwater; put them into a slow oven, and stew them for three or four\r\nhours. Both stewed rhubarb and stewed pears often act as mild and\r\ngentle aperients. Muscatel raisins, eaten at dessert, will oftentimes\r\nwithout medicine relieve the bowels.\r\n\r\n12. COLD WATER--A tumblerful of cold water, taken early every morning,\r\nsometimes effectually relieves the bowels; indeed, few people know the\r\nvalue of cold water as an aperient it is one of the best we possess,\r\nand, unlike drug aperients, can never by any possibility do any harm.\r\nAn injection of warm water is one of the best ways to relieve the\r\nbowels.\r\n\r\n13. WELL-COOKED VEGETABLES.--Although a nursing mother ought, more\r\nespecially if she be costive, to take a variety of well-cooked\r\nvegetables, such as potatoes, asparagus, cauliflower, French beans,\r\nspinach, stewed celery and turnips; she should avoid eating greens,\r\ncabbages, and pickles, as they would be likely to affect the babe, and\r\nmight cause him to suffer from gripings, from pain, and \"looseness\" of\r\nthe bowels.\r\n\r\n\r\n14. SUPERSEDE THE NECESSITY OF TAKING PHYSIC.--Let me again--for it\r\ncannot be too urgently insisted upon--strongly advise a nursing\r\nmother to use every means in the way of diet, etc., to supersede the\r\nnecessity of taking physic (opening medicine), as the repetition\r\nof aperients injures, and that severely, both herself and child.\r\nMoreover, the more opening medicine she swallows, the more she\r\nrequires; so that if she once gets into the habit of regularly\r\ntaking physic, the bowels will not act without them. What a miserable\r\nexistence to be always swallowing physic!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEALTHY YOUTH AND RIPE OLD AGE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHOME LESSONS IN NURSING SICK CHILDREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. MISMANAGEMENT.--Every doctor knows that a large share of the ills\r\nto which infancy is subject are directly traceable to mismanagement.\r\nTroubles of the digestive system are, for the most part due to errors,\r\neither in the selection of the food or in the preparation of it.\r\n\r\n2. RESPIRATORY DISEASES.--Respiratory diseases or the diseases of the\r\nthroat and lungs have their origin, as a rule, in want of care and\r\njudgment in matters of clothing, bathing and exposure to cold\r\nand drafts. A child should always be dressed to suit the existing\r\ntemperature of the weather.\r\n\r\n3. NERVOUS DISEASES.--Nervous diseases are often aggravated if not\r\ncaused by over-stimulation of the brain, by irregular hours of sleep,\r\nor by the use of \"soothing\" medicines, or eating indigestible food.\r\n\r\n4. SKIN AFFECTIONS.--Skin affections are generally due to want of\r\nproper care of the skin, to improper clothing or feeding, or to\r\nindiscriminate association with nurses and Children, who are the\r\ncarriers of contagious diseases.\r\n\r\n5. PERMANENT INJURY.--Permanent injury is often caused by lifting the\r\nchild by one hand, allowing it to fall, permitting it to play with\r\nsharp instruments, etc.\r\n\r\n6. RULES AND PRINCIPLES.--Every mother should understand the rules and\r\nprinciples of home nursing. Children are very tender plants and the\r\nwant of proper knowledge is often very disastrous if not fatal. Study\r\ncarefully and follow the principles and rules which are laid down in\r\nthe different parts of this work on nursing and cooking for the sick.\r\n\r\n7. WHAT A MOTHER SHOULD KNOW:\r\n\r\n  I. INFANT FEEDING.--The care of milk, milk sterilization, care of\r\n  bottles, preparation of commonly employed infant foods, the general\r\n  principles of infant feeding, with rules as to quality and\r\n  frequency.\r\n\r\n  II. BATHING.--The daily bath; the use of hot, cold and mustard\r\n  baths.\r\n\r\n  III. HYGIENE OF THE SKIN. Care of the mouth, eyes and ears.\r\n  Ventilation, temperature, cleanliness, care of napkins, etc.\r\n\r\n  IV. TRAINING OF CHILDREN in proper bodily habits. Simple means of\r\n  treatment in sickness, etc.\r\n\r\n8. THE CRY OF THE SICK CHILD.--The cry of the child is a language\r\nby which the character of its suffering to some extent may be\r\nascertained. The manner in which the cry is uttered, or the pitch and\r\ntone is generally a symptom of a certain kind of disease.\r\n\r\n9. STOMACHACHE.--The cry of the child in suffering with pain of the\r\nstomach is loud, excitable and spasmodic. The legs are drawn up and as\r\nthe pain ceases, they are relaxed and the child sobs itself to sleep,\r\nand rests until awakened again by pain.\r\n\r\n10. LUNG TROUBLE.--When a child is suffering with an affection of the\r\nlungs or throat, it never cries loudly or continuously. A distress in\r\nbreathing causes a sort of subdued cry and low moaning. If there is\r\na slight cough it is generally a sign that there is some complication\r\nwith the lungs.\r\n\r\n11. DISEASE OF THE BRAIN.--In disease of the brain the cry is always\r\nsharp, short and piercing. Drowsiness generally follows each spasm of\r\npain.\r\n\r\n12. FEVERS.--Children rarely cry when suffering with fever unless they\r\nare disturbed. They should be handled very gently and spoken to in a\r\nvery quiet and tender tone of voice.\r\n\r\n13. THE CHAMBER OF THE SICK ROOM.--The room of the sick child should\r\nbe kept scrupulously clean. No noise should disturb the quiet and rest\r\nof the child. If the weather is mild, plenty of fresh air should\r\nbe admitted; the temperature should be kept at about 70 degrees. A\r\nthermometer should be kept in the room, and the air should be changed\r\nseveral times during the day. This may be done with safety to the\r\nchild by covering it up with woolen blankets to protect it from draft,\r\nwhile the windows and doors are opened. Fresh air often does more to\r\nrestore the sick child than the doctor's medicine. Take the best\r\nroom in the house. If necessary take the parlor, always make the room\r\npleasant for the sick.\r\n\r\n14. VISITORS.--Carefully avoid the conversation of visitors or the\r\nloud and boisterous playing of children in the house. If there is much\r\nnoise about the house that cannot be avoided, it is a good plan to put\r\ncotton in the ears of the patient.\r\n\r\n15. LIGHT IN THE ROOM.--Light has a tendency to produce nervous\r\nirritability, consequently it is best to exclude as much daylight\r\nas possible and keep the room in a sort of twilight until the child\r\nbegins to improve. Be careful to avoid any odor coming from a burning\r\nlamp in the night. When the child begins to recover, give it plenty of\r\nsunlight. After the child begins to get better let in all the sunlight\r\nthe windows will admit. Take a south room for the sick bed.\r\n\r\n16. SICKNESS IN SUMMER.--If the weather is very hot it is a good plan\r\nto dampen the floors with cold water, or set several dishes of water\r\nin the room, but be careful to keep the patient out of the draft, and\r\navoid any sudden change of temperature.\r\n\r\n17. BATHING.--Bathe every sick child in warm water once a day unless\r\nprohibited by the doctor. If the child has a spasm or any attack of a\r\nserious nervous character in absence of the doctor, place him in a hot\r\nbath at once. Hot water is one of the finest agencies for the cure of\r\nnervous diseases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n18. SCARLET FEVER AND MEASLES.--Bathe the child in warm water to bring\r\nout the rash, and put in about a dessertspoonsful of mustard into each\r\nbath.\r\n\r\n19. DRINKS.--If a child is suffering with fevers, let it have all the\r\nwater it wants. Toast-water will be found nourishing. When the stomach\r\nof the child is in an irritable condition, nourishments containing\r\nmilk or any other fluid should be given very sparingly. Barley-water\r\nand rice-water are very soothing to an irritable stomach.\r\n\r\n20. FOOD.--Mellin's Food and milk is very nourishing if the child\r\nwill take it. Oatmeal gruel, white of eggs, etc. are excellent and\r\nnourishing articles. See \"How to cook for the Sick.\"\r\n\r\n21. EATING FRUIT.--Let children who are recovering from sickness eat\r\nmoderately of good fresh fruit. Never let a child, whether well or\r\nsick, eat the skins of any kind of fruit. The outer covering of fruit\r\nwas not made to eat, and often has poisonous matter very injurious to\r\nhealth upon its surface. Contagious and infectious diseases are often\r\ncommunicated in that way.\r\n\r\n22. SUDDEN STARTINGS with the thumbs drawn into the palms, portend\r\ntrouble with the brain, and often end in convulsions, which are far\r\nmore serious in infants than in children. Convulsions in children\r\noften result from a suppression of urine. If you have occasion to\r\nbelieve that such is the case, get the patient to sweating as soon as\r\npossible. Give it a hot bath, after which cover it up in bed and put\r\nbags of hot salt over the lower part of the abdomen.\r\n\r\n23. SYMPTOMS OF INDIGESTION.--If the baby shows symptoms of\r\nindigestion, do not begin giving it medicine. It is wiser to decrease\r\nthe quantity and quality of the food and let the little one omit one\r\nmeal entirely, that his stomach may rest. Avoid all starchy foods,\r\nas the organs of digestion are not sufficiently developed to receive\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\nA TABLE FOR FEEDING A BABY ON MODIFIED MILK.\r\n\r\n2d week:\r\nTop Milk 1-1/2 oz.\r\nMilk Sugar 4 teaspoons\r\nBarley Gruel 10 oz.\r\nCream 2-3/4 oz.\r\nLime Water 2 oz.\r\n1-1/2 oz. at feeding\r\n10 times a day\r\n\r\n3d week:\r\nTop Milk 6 oz.\r\nMilk Sugar 5-1/2 teaspoons\r\nBarley Gruel 18 oz.\r\nLime Water 4 oz.\r\n2 oz. at feeding\r\n10 times a day\r\n\r\n4th to 8th week:\r\nTop Milk 9 oz.\r\nMilk Sugar 8 teaspoons\r\nBarley Gruel to make a quart\r\nLime Water 4 oz.\r\n3 oz. at feeding\r\n8 times a day\r\n\r\n9th to 12th week:\r\nTop Milk 11 oz.\r\nMilk Sugar 7-1/2 teaspoons\r\nBarley Gruel to make a quart\r\nLime Water 4 oz.\r\n3 oz. at feeding\r\n8 times a day\r\n\r\n4th month:\r\nTop Milk 13 oz.\r\nMilk Sugar 7 teaspoons\r\nBarley Gruel to make a quart\r\nLime Water 4 oz.\r\n3 to 4 oz. at feeding\r\n7 times a day\r\n\r\n5th to 7th month:\r\nTop Milk 15 oz.\r\nMilk Sugar 6-1/2 teaspoons\r\nBarley Gruel to make a quart\r\nLime Water 4 oz.\r\n4 to 5 oz. at feeding\r\n6 times a day\r\n\r\n7th to 9th month:\r\nTop Milk 17 oz.\r\nMilk Sugar 6 teaspoons\r\nBarley Gruel to make a quart\r\nLime Water 4 oz.\r\n6 to 7 oz. at feeding\r\n6 times a day\r\n\r\nTop Milk--Let your quart of milk stand until the cream has risen, then\r\npour off number of ounces required.\r\n\r\nSugar of Milk may be purchased at your local druggist's.\r\n\r\nGruel is prepared by cooking one level tablespoon of any good barley\r\nflour in a pint of water with a pinch of salt.

The mother's milk is the natural food, and nothing can fully take\r\nits place.\r\n\r\n2. The infant's stomach does not readily accommodate itself to changes\r\nin diet; therefore, regularity in quality, quantity and temperature is\r\nextremely necessary.\r\n\r\n3. Not until a child is a year old should it be allowed any food\r\nexcept that of milk, and possibly a little cracker or bread,\r\nthoroughly soaked and softened.\r\n\r\n4. Meat should never be given to very young children. The best\r\nartificial food is cream, reduced and sweetened with sugar and milk.\r\nNo rule can be given for its reduction. Observation and experience\r\nmust teach that, because every child's stomach is governed by a rule\r\nof its own.\r\n\r\n5. A child can be safely weaned at one year of age, and sometimes\r\nless. It depends entirely upon the season, and upon the health of the\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n6. A child should never be weaned during the warm weather, in June,\r\nJuly or August.\r\n\r\n7. When a child is weaned it may be given, in connection with the milk\r\ndiet, some such nourishment as broth, gruel, egg, or some prepared\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n8. A child should never be allowed to come to the table until two\r\nyears of age.\r\n\r\n9. A child should never eat much starchy food until four years old.\r\n\r\n10. A child should have all the water it desires to drink, but it is\r\ndecidedly the best to boil the water first, and allow it to cool. All\r\nthe impurities and disease germs are thereby destroyed. This one thing\r\nalone will add greatly to the health and vigor of the child.\r\n\r\n11. Where there is a tendency to bowel disorder, a little gum arabic,\r\nrice, or barley may be boiled with the drinking water.\r\n\r\n12. If the child uses a bottle it should be kept absolutely clean.\r\nIt is best to have two or three bottles, so that one will always be\r\nperfectly clean and fresh.\r\n\r\n13. The nipple should be of black or pure rubber, and not of the white\r\nor vulcanized rubber; it should fit over the top of the bottle. No\r\ntubes should ever be used; it is impossible to keep them clean.\r\n\r\n14. When the rubber becomes coated, a little coarse salt will clean\r\nit.\r\n\r\n15. Babies should be fed at regular times. They should also be put to\r\nsleep at regular hours. Regularity is one of the best safeguards to\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\n16. Milk for babies and children should be from healthy cows. Milk\r\nfrom different cows varies, and it is always better for a child\r\nto have milk from the same cow. A farrow cow's milk is preferable,\r\nespecially if the child is not very strong.\r\n\r\n17. Many of the prepared foods advertised for children are of little\r\nbenefit. A few may be good, but what is good for one child may not be\r\nfor another. So it must be simply a matter of experiment if any of the\r\nadvertised foods are used.\r\n\r\n18. It is a physiological fact that an infant is always healthier\r\nand better to sleep alone. It gets better air and is not liable to\r\nsuffocation.\r\n\r\n19. A healthy child should never be fed in less than two hours from\r\nthe last time they finished before, gradually lengthening the time\r\nas it grows older. At 4 months 3-1/2 or 4 hours; at 5 months a healthy\r\nchild will be better if given nothing in the night except, perhaps, a\r\nlittle water.\r\n\r\n20. Give an infant a little water several times a day.\r\n\r\n21. A delicate child the first year should be oiled after each bath.\r\nThe oiling may often take the place of the bath, in case of a cold.\r\n\r\n22. In oiling a babe, use pure olive oil, and wipe off thoroughly\r\nafter each application. For nourishing a weak child use also olive\r\noil.\r\n\r\n23. For colds, coughs, croup, etc., use goose oil externally and give\r\na teaspoonful at bed-time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOUND UPON THE DOORSTEP.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHOW TO PRESERVE THE HEALTH AND LIFE OF YOUR INFANT DURING HOT\r\nWEATHER.\r\n\r\n\r\n_BATHING._\r\n\r\n1. Bathe infants daily in tepid water and even twice a day in hot\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nIf delicate they should be sponged instead of immersing them in water,\r\nbut cleanliness is absolutely necessary for the health of infants.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CLOTHING._\r\n\r\n2. Put no bands in their clothing, but make all garments to hang\r\nloosely from the shoulders, and have all their clothing _scrupulously\r\nclean_; even the diaper should not be re-used without rinsing.\r\n\r\n\r\n_SLEEP ALONE._\r\n\r\n3. The child should in all cases sleep by itself on a cot or in a crib\r\nand retire at a regular hour. A child _always_ early taught to go to\r\nsleep without rocking or nursing is the healthier and happier for it.\r\nBegin _at birth_ and this will be easily accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CORDIALS AND SOOTHING SYRUPS._\r\n\r\n4. Never give cordials, soothing syrups, sleeping drops etc., without\r\nthe advice of a physician. A child that frets and does not sleep is\r\neither hungry or ill. _If ill it needs a physician._ Never give candy\r\nor cake to quiet a small child, they are sure to produce disorders of\r\nthe stomach, diarrhoea or some other trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n_FRESH AIR._\r\n\r\n5. Children should have plenty of fresh air summer as well as winter.\r\nAvoid the severe hot sun and the heated kitchen for infants in summer.\r\nHeat is the great destroyer of infants.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CLEAN HOUSES._\r\n\r\n6. Keep your house clean and cool and well aired night and day. Your\r\ncellars cleared of all rubbish and white-washed every spring, your\r\ndrains cleaned with strong solution of copperas or chloride of lime,\r\npoured down them once a week. Keep your gutters and yards clean and\r\ninsist upon your neighbors doing the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n_EVACUATIONS OF A CHILD._\r\n\r\nThe healthy motion varies from light orange yellow to greenish yellow,\r\nin number, two to four times daily. Smell should never be offensive.\r\nSlimy mucous-like jelly passages indicate worms. Pale green,\r\noffensive, acrid motions indicate disordered stomach. Dark green\r\nindicate acid secretions and a more serious trouble.\r\n\r\nFetid dark brown stools are present in chronic diarrhoea Putty-like\r\npasty passages are due to aridity curdling the milk or to torpid\r\nliver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n_BREAST MILK._\r\n\r\n7. Breast milk is the only proper food for infants until after the\r\nsecond summer. If the supply is small keep what you have and feed the\r\nchild in connection with it, for if the babe is ill this breast milk\r\nmay be all that will save its life.\r\n\r\n\r\n_STERILIZED MILK._\r\n\r\n8. Milk is the best food. Goat's milk best, cows milk next. If the\r\nchild thrives on this _nothing else_ should be given during the hot\r\nweather, until the front teeth are cut. Get fresh cow's milk twice\r\na day if the child requires food in the night, pour it into a glass\r\nfruit jar with one-third pure water for a child under three months\r\nold, afterwards the proportion of water may be less and less, also a\r\ntrifle of sugar may be added.\r\n\r\nThen place the jar in a kettle or pan of cold water, like the bottom\r\nof an oatmeal kettle. Leave the cover of the jar loose. Place it on\r\nthe stove and let the water come to a boil and boil ten minutes, screw\r\ndown the cover tight and boil ten minutes more, then remove from the\r\nfire, and allow it to cool in the water slowly so as not to break\r\nthe jar. When partly cool put on the ice or in a cool place, and keep\r\ntightly covered except when the milk is poured out for use. The glass\r\njar must be kept perfectly clean and washed and scalded carefully\r\nbefore use. A tablespoonful of lime water to a bottle of milk will\r\naid indigestion. Discard the bottle as soon as possible and use a\r\ncup which you know is clean, whereas a bottle must be kept in water\r\nconstantly when not in use, or the sour milk will make the child sick.\r\nUse no tube for it is exceedingly hard to keep it clean, and if pure\r\nmilk cannot be had, condensed milk is admirable and does not need to\r\nbe sterilized as the above.\r\n\r\n\r\n_DIET._\r\n\r\n9. Never give babies under two years old such food if grown persons\r\neat. Their chief diet should be milk, wheat bread and milk, oatmeal,\r\npossibly a little rare boiled egg, but always and chiefly milk. Germ\r\nwheat is also excellent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n_EXERCISE._\r\n\r\n10. Children should have exercise in the house as well as outdoors,\r\nbut should not be jolted and jumped and jarred in rough play, not\r\nrudely rocked in the cradle, nor carelessly trundled over bumps in\r\ntheir carriages. They should not be held too much in the arms, but\r\nallowed to crawl and kick upon the floor and develop their limbs and\r\nmuscles. A child should not be lifted by its arms nor dragged along by\r\none hand after it learns to take a few feeble steps, but when they do\r\nlearn to walk steadily it is the best of all exercise, especially in\r\nthe open air.\r\n\r\nLet the children as they grow older romp and play in the open air all\r\nthey wish, girls as well as boys. Give the girls an even chance for\r\nhealth, while they are young at least, and don't mind about their\r\ncomplexion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nINFANT TEETHING.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. REMARKABLE INSTANCES.--There are instances where babies have been\r\nborn with teeth, and, on the other hand, there are cases of persons\r\nwho have never had any teeth at all; and others that had double teeth\r\nall around in both upper and lower jaws, but these are rare instances,\r\nand may be termed as a sort of freaks of nature.\r\n\r\n2. INFANT TEETHING.--The first teeth generally make their appearance\r\nafter the third month, and during the period of teething the child is\r\nfretful and restless, causing sometimes constitutional disturbances,\r\nsuch as diarrhoea, indigestion, etc. Usually, however, no serious\r\nresults follow, and no unnecessary anxiety need be felt, unless\r\nthe weather is extremely warm, then there is some danger of summer\r\ncomplaint setting in and seriously complicating matters.\r\n\r\n3. THE NUMBER OF TEETH.--Teeth are generally cut in pairs and make\r\ntheir appearance first in the front and going backwards until all are\r\ncomplete. It generally takes about two years for a temporary set of\r\nchildren's teeth. A child two or three years old should have twenty\r\nteeth. After the age of seven they generally begin to loosen and fall\r\nout and permanent teeth take their place.\r\n\r\n4. LANCING THE GUMS.--This is very rarely necessary. There are extreme\r\ncases when the condition of the mouth and health of the child demand\r\na physician's lance, but this should not he resorted to, unless it\r\nis absolutely necessary. When the gums are very much swollen and\r\nthe tooth is nearly through, the pains may be relieved by the mother\r\ntaking a thimble and pressing it down upon the tooth, the sharp edges\r\nof the tooth will cut through the swollen flesh, and instant relief\r\nwill follow. A child in a few hours or a day will be perfectly happy\r\nafter a very severe and trying time of sickness.\r\n\r\n5. PERMANENT TEETH.--The teeth are firmly inserted in sockets of the\r\nupper and lower jaw. The permanent teeth which follow the temporary\r\nteeth, when complete, are sixteen in each jaw, or thirty-two in all.\r\n\r\n6. NAMES OF TEETH.--There are four incisors (front teeth), four\r\ncuspids (eye teeth), four bicuspids (grinders), and four molars (large\r\ngrinders), in each jaw. Each tooth is divided into the crown, body,\r\nand root. The crown is the grinding surface; the body--the part\r\nprojecting from the jaw--is the seat of sensation and nutrition; the\r\nroot is that portion of the tooth which is inserted in the alveolus.\r\nThe teeth are composed of dentine (ivory) and enamel. The ivory forms\r\nthe greater portion of the body and root, while the enamel covers the\r\nexposed surface. The small white cords communicating with the teeth\r\nare the nerves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT FOR THE DISEASES OF INFANTS AND CHILDREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Out of every 1000 persons that died during the year of 1912, 175\r\ndid not reach one year of age, and 244 died under five years of age.\r\n\r\nWhat a fearful responsibility therefore rests upon the parents who\r\npermit these hundreds of thousands of children to die annually. This\r\nterrible mortality among children is undoubtedly largely the result\r\nof ignorance as regarding to the proper care and treatment of sick\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n2. For very small children it is always best to use homoeopathic\r\nremedies.\r\n\r\n\r\n_COLIC._\r\n\r\n1. Babies often suffer severely with colic. It is not considered\r\ndangerous, but causes considerable suffering.\r\n\r\n2. Severe colic is usually the result of derangement of the liver in\r\nthe mother, or of her insufficient or improper nourishment, and it\r\noccurs more frequently when the child is from two to five months old.\r\n3. Let the mother eat chiefly barley, wheat and bread, rolled wheat,\r\ngraham bread, fish, milk, eggs and fruit. The latter may be freely\r\neaten, avoiding that which is very sour.\r\n\r\n4. A rubber bag or bottle filled with hot water put into a crib,\r\nwill keep the child, once quieted, asleep for hours. If a child is\r\nsuffering from colic, it should be thoroughly warmed and kept warm.\r\n\r\n5. Avoid giving opiates of any kind, such as cordials, Mrs. Winslow's\r\nSoothing Syrup, \"Mother's Friend,\" and various other patent medicines.\r\nThey injure the stomach and health of the child, instead of benefiting\r\nit.\r\n\r\n6. REMEDIES.--A few tablespoonfuls of hot water will often allay a\r\nsevere attack of the colic. Catnip tea is also a good remedy.\r\n\r\nA drop of essence of peppermint in 6 or 7 teaspoonfuls of hot water\r\nwill give relief.\r\n\r\nIf the stools are green and the child is very restless, give\r\nchamomilla.\r\n\r\nIf the child is suffering from constipation, and undigested curds of\r\nmilk appear in its faeces, and the child starts suddenly in its sleep,\r\ngive nux vomica.\r\n\r\nAn injection of a few spoonfuls of hot water into the rectum with\r\na little asafoetida is an effective remedy, and will be good for an\r\nadult.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CONSTIPATION._\r\n\r\n1. This is a very frequent ailment of infants. The first thing\r\nnecessary is for the mother to regulate her diet.\r\n\r\n2. If the child is nursed regularly and held out at the same time of\r\neach day, it will seldom be troubled with this complaint. Give plenty\r\nof _water_. Regularity of habit is the remedy. If this method fails,\r\nuse a soap suppository. Make it by paring a piece of white castile\r\nsoap round. It should be made about the size of a lead pencil, pointed\r\nat the end.\r\n\r\n3. Avoid giving a baby drugs. Let the physician administer them if\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n_DIARRHOEA._\r\n\r\nGreat care should be exercised by parents in checking the diarrhoea of\r\nchildren. Many times serious diseases are brought on by parents being\r\ntoo hasty in checking this disorder of the bowels. It is an infant's\r\nfirst method of removing obstructions and overcoming derangements of\r\nthe system.\r\n\r\n\r\n_SUMMER COMPLAINT._\r\n\r\n1. Summer complaint is an irritation and inflammation of the lining\r\nmembranes of the intestines. This may often be caused by teething,\r\neating indigestible food, etc.\r\n\r\n2. If the discharges are only frequent and yellow and not accompanied\r\nwith pain, there is no cause for anxiety; but if the discharges\r\nare green, soon becoming gray, brown and sometimes frothy, having\r\na mixture of phlegm, and sometimes containing food undigested, a\r\nphysician had better be summoned.\r\n\r\n3. For mild attacks the following treatment may be given:\r\n\r\n1) Keep the child perfectly quiet and keep the room well aired.\r\n\r\n2) Put a drop of tincture of camphor on a teaspoonful of sugar,\r\nmix thoroughly; then add 6 teaspoonfuls of hot water and give a\r\nteaspoonful of the mixture every ten minutes. This is indicated where\r\nthe discharges are watery, and where there is vomiting and coldness of\r\nthe feet and hands. Chamomilla is also an excellent remedy. Ipecac and\r\nnux vomica may also be given.\r\n\r\nIn giving homoeopathic remedies, give 5 or 6 pellets every 2 or 3\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n3) The diet should be wholesome and nourishing.\r\n\r\n\r\n_FOR TEETHING._\r\n\r\nIf a child is suffering with swollen gums, is feverish, restless, and\r\nstarts in its sleep, give nux vomica.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_PIN WORMS._\r\n\r\nPin worms and round worms are the most common in children. They are\r\ngenerally found in the lower bowels.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--Restlessness, itching about the anus in the fore part of\r\nthe evening, and worms in the faeces.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--Give with a syringe an injection of a tablespoonful of\r\nlinseed oil. Cleanliness is also very necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n_ROUND WORMS._\r\n\r\nA round worm is from six to sixteen inches in length, resembling the\r\ncommon earth worm. It inhabits generally the small intestines, but it\r\nsometimes enters the stomach and is thrown up by vomiting.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--Distress, indigestion, swelling of the abdomen, grinding of\r\nthe teeth, restlessness, and sometimes convulsions.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--One teaspoonful of powdered wormseed mixed with a\r\nsufficient quantity of molasses, or spread on bread and butter.\r\n\r\nOr, one grain of santonine every four hours for two or three\r\ndays, followed by a brisk cathartic. Wormwood tea is also highly\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\n  SWAIM'S VERMIFUGE.\r\n  2 ounces wormseed,\r\n  1-1/2 ounces valerian,\r\n  1-1/2 ounces rhubarb,\r\n  1-1/2 ounces pink-root,\r\n  1-1/2 ounces white agaric.\r\n\r\nBoil in sufficient water to yield 3 quarts of decoction, and add to it\r\n30 drops of oil of tansy and 45 drops of oil of cloves, dissolved in a\r\nquart of rectified spirits. Dose, 1 teaspoonful at night.\r\n\r\n\r\n_ANOTHER EXCELLENT VERMIFUGE._\r\n\r\n  Oil of wormseed, 1 ounce,\r\n  Oil of anise, 1 ounce,\r\n  Castor oil, 1 ounce,\r\n  Tinct. of myrrh, 2 drops,\r\n  Oil of turpentine, 10 drops.\r\n\r\nMix thoroughly.\r\n\r\nAlways shake well before using.\r\n\r\nGive 10 to 15 drops in cold coffee, once or twice a day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO TREAT CROUP\r\n\r\nSPASMODIC AND TRUE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_SPASMODIC CROUP._\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--A spasmodic closure of the glottis which interferes with\r\nrespiration. Comes on suddenly and usually at night, without much\r\nwarning. It is a purely nervous disease and may be caused by reflex\r\nnervous irritation from undigested food in the stomach or bowels,\r\nirritation of the gums in dentition, or from brain disorders.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--Child awakens suddenly at night with suspended respiration\r\nor very difficult breathing. After a few respirations it cries out and\r\nthen falls asleep quietly, or the attack may last an hour or so, when\r\nthe face will become pale, veins in the neck become turgid and feet\r\nand hands contract spasmodically. In mild cases the attacks will only\r\noccur once during the night, but may recur on the following night.\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.--During the paroxysm dashing cold water in the face\r\nis a common remedy. To terminate the spasm and prevent its return give\r\nteaspoonful doses of powdered alum. The syrup of squills is an old and\r\ntried remedy; give in 15 to 30 drop doses and repeat every 10 minutes\r\ntill vomiting occurs. Seek out the cause if possible and remove it. It\r\ncommonly lies in some derangement of the digestive organs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_TRUE CROUP._\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--This disease consists of an inflammation of the mucous\r\nmembrane of the upper air passages, particularly of the larynx with\r\nthe formation of a false membrane that obstructs the breathing. The\r\ndisease is most common in children between the ages of two and seven\r\nyears, but it may occur at any age.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--Usually there are symptoms of a cold for three or four days\r\nprevious to the attack. Marked hoarseness is observed in the evening\r\nwith a ringing metallic cough and some difficulty in breathing, which\r\nincreases and becomes somewhat paroxysmal till the face which was at\r\nfirst flushed becomes pallid and ashy in hue. The efforts at breathing\r\nbecome very great, and unless the child gets speedy relief it will die\r\nof suffocation.\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.--Patient should be kept in a moist warm atmosphere,\r\nand cold water applied to the neck early in the attack. As soon as the\r\nbreathing seems difficult give a half to one teaspoonful of powdered\r\nalum in honey to produce vomiting and apply the remedies suggested in\r\nthe treatment of diphtheria, as the two diseases are thought by many\r\nto be identical. When the breathing becomes labored and face becomes\r\npallid, the condition is very serious and a physician should be called\r\nwithout delay.\r\n\r\n\r\n_SCARLET FEVER._\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--An eruptive contagious disease, brought about by direct\r\nexposure to those having the disease, or by contact with clothing,\r\ndishes, or other articles, used about the sick room.\r\n\r\nThe clothing may be disinfected by heating to a temperature of 230\r\n[degrees] Fahrenheit or by dipping in boiling water before washing.\r\n\r\nDogs and cats will also carry the disease and should be kept from the\r\nhouse, and particularly from the sick room.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--Chilly sensations or a decided chill, fever, headache,\r\nfurred tongue, vomiting, sore throat, rapid pulse, hot dry skin and\r\nmore or less stupor. In from 6 to 18 hours a fine red rash appears\r\nabout the ears, neck and shoulders, which rapidly spreads to the\r\nentire surface of the body. After a few days, a scurf or branny scales\r\nwill begin to form on the skin. These scales are the principal source\r\nof contagion.\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.\r\n\r\n1. Isolate the patient from other members of the family to prevent the\r\nspread of the disease.\r\n\r\n2. Keep the patient in bed and give a fluid diet of milk gruel, beef\r\ntea, etc., with plenty of cold water to drink.\r\n\r\n3. Control the fever by sponging the body with tepid water, and\r\nrelieve the pain in the throat by cold compresses, applied externally.\r\n\r\n4. As soon as the skin shows a tendency to become scaly, apply goose\r\ngrease or clean lard with a little boracic acid powder dusted in it,\r\nor better, perhaps, carbolized vaseline to relieve the itching and\r\nprevent the scales from being scattered about, and subjecting others\r\nto the contagion.\r\n\r\nREGULAR TREATMENT.--A few drops of aconite every three hours to\r\nregulate the pulse, and if the skin be pale and circulation feeble,\r\nwith tardy eruption, administer one to ten drops of tincture of\r\nbelladonna, according to the age of the patient. At the end of third\r\nweek, if eyes look puffy and feet swell, there is danger of Acute\r\nBright's disease, and a physician should be consulted. If the case\r\ndoes not progress well under the home remedies suggested, a physician\r\nshould be called at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n_WHOOPING COUGH._\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--This is a contagious disease which is known by a peculiar\r\nwhooping sound in the cough. Considerable mucus is thrown off after\r\neach attack of spasmodic coughing.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--It usually commences with the symptoms of a common cold\r\nin the head, some chilliness, feverishness, restlessness, headache, a\r\nfeeling of tightness across the chest, violent paroxysms of coughing,\r\nsometimes almost threatening suffocation, and accompanied with\r\nvomiting.\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.--Patient should eat plain food and avoid cold drafts\r\nand damp air, but keep in the open air as much as possible. A strong\r\ntea made of the tops of red clover is highly recommended. A strong tea\r\nmade of chestnut leaves, sweetened with sugar, is also very good.\r\n\r\n  1 teaspoonful of powdered alum,\r\n  1 teaspoonful of syrup.\r\n\r\nMix in a tumbler of water, and give the child one teaspoonful every\r\ntwo or three hours. A kerosene lamp kept burning in the bed chamber\r\nat night is said to lessen the cough and shorten the course of the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n\r\n_MUMPS._\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--This is a contagious disease causing the inflammation\r\nof the salivary glands, and is generally a disease of childhood and\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--A slight fever, stiffness of the neck and lower jaw,\r\nswelling and soreness of the gland. It usually develops in four or\r\nfive days and then begins to disappear.\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.--Apply to the swelling a hot poultice of cornmeal and\r\nbread and milk. A hop poultice is also excellent. Take a good dose of\r\nphysic and rest carefully. A warm general bath, or mustard foot bath,\r\nis very good. Avoid exposure or cold drafts. If a bad cold is taken,\r\nserious results may follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_MEASLES._\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--It is an eruptive, contagious disease, preceded by cough\r\nand other catarrhal symptoms for about four or five days. The eruption\r\ncomes rapidly in small red spots, which are slightly raised.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--A feeling of weakness, loss of appetite, some fever, cold\r\nin the head, frequent sneezing, watery eyes, dry cough and a hot skin.\r\nThe disease takes effect nine or ten days after exposure.\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.--Measles is not a dangerous disease in the child,\r\nbut in an adult it is often very serious. In childhood very little\r\nmedicine is necessary, but exposure must be carefully avoided, and\r\nthe patient kept in bed, in a moderately warm room. The diet should\r\nbe light and nourishing. Keep the room dark. If the eruption does not\r\ncome out promptly, apply hot baths.\r\n\r\nCOMMON TREATMENT.--Two teaspoonfuls of spirits of nitre, one\r\nteaspoonful paregoric, one wineglassful of camphor water. Mix\r\nthoroughly, and give a teaspoonful in half a teacupful of water every\r\ntwo hours. To relieve the cough, if troublesome, flax seed tea, or\r\ninfusion of slippery-elm bark, with a little lemon juice to render\r\nmore palatable, will be of benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHICKEN POX._\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--This is a contagious, eruptive disease, which resembles\r\nto some extent small-pox. The pointed vesicles or pimples have a\r\ndepression in the center in chicken-pox, and in small pox they do not.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--Nine to seventeen days elapse after the exposure, before\r\nsymptoms appear. Slight fever, a sense of sickness, the appearance of\r\nscattered pimples, some itching and heat. The pimples rapidly change\r\ninto little blisters, filled with a watery fluid. After five or six\r\ndays they disappear.\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.--Milk diet, and avoid all kinds of meat. Keep the\r\nbowels open, and avoid all exposure to cold. Large vesicles on the\r\nface should be punctured early and irritation by rubbing should be\r\navoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n_HOME TREATMENT OF DIPHTHERIA._\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--Acute, specific, constitutional disease, with local\r\nmanifestations in the throat, mouth, nose, larynx, wind-pipe, and\r\nglands of the neck. The disease is infectious but not very contagious\r\nunder the proper precautions. It is a disease of childhood, though\r\nadults sometimes contract it. Many of the best physicians of the\r\nday consider true or membranous croup to be due to this diphtheritic\r\nmembranous disease thus located in the larynx or trachea.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--Symptoms vary according to the severity of the attack.\r\nChills, fever, headache, languor, loss of appetite, stiffness of neck,\r\nwith tenderness about the angles of the jaw, soreness of the throat,\r\npain in the ear, aching of the limbs, loss of strength, coated tongue,\r\nswelling of the neck, and offensive breath; lymphatic glands on side\r\nof neck enlarged and tender. The throat is first to be seen red and\r\nswollen, then covered with grayish white patches, which spread, and\r\na false membrane is found on the mucous membrane. If the nose is\r\nattacked, there will be an offensive discharge, and the child will\r\nbreathe through the mouth. If the larynx or throat are involved,\r\nthe voice will become hoarse, and a croupy cough, with difficult\r\nbreathing, shows that the air passage to the lungs is being obstructed\r\nby the false membrane.\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.--Isolate the patient, to prevent the spread of the\r\ndisease. Diet should be of the most nutritious character, as milk,\r\neggs, broths, and oysters. Give at intervals of every two or three\r\nhours. If patient refuses to swallow, from the pain caused by the\r\neffort, a nutrition injection must be resorted to. Inhalations of\r\nsteam and hot water, and allowing the patient to suck pellets of ice,\r\nwill give relief. Sponges dipped in hot water, and applied to the\r\nangles of the jaw, are beneficial. Inhalations of lime, made by\r\nslaking freshly burnt lime in a vessel, and directing the vapor to the\r\nchild's mouth, by means of a newspaper, or similar contrivance. Flour\r\nof sulphur, blown into the back of the mouth and throat by means of\r\na goose quill, has been highly recommended. Frequent gargling of the\r\nthroat and mouth, with a solution of lactic acid, strong enough to\r\ntaste sour, will help to keep the parts clean, and correct the\r\nfoul breath. If there is great prostration, with the nasal passage\r\naffected, or hoarseness and difficult breathing, a physician should be\r\ncalled at once.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF WOMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n_DISORDERS OF THE MENSES._\r\n\r\n1. SUPPRESSION OF, OR SCANTY MENSES.\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.--Attention to the diet, and exercise in the open air\r\nto promote the general health. Some bitter tonic, taken with fifteen\r\ngrains of dialyzed iron, well diluted, after meals, if patient is pale\r\nand debilitated. A hot foot bath is often all that is necessary.\r\n\r\n2. PROFUSE MENSTRUATION.\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.--Avoid highly seasoned food, and the use of spirituous\r\nliquors; also excessive fatigue, either physical or mental. To check\r\nthe flow, patient should be kept quiet, and allowed to sip cinnamon\r\ntea during the period.\r\n\r\n3. PAINFUL MENSTRUATION.\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.--Often brought on by colds. Treat by warm hip baths,\r\nhot drinks (avoiding spirituous liquors), and heat applied to the back\r\nand extremities. A teaspoonful of the fluid extract of viburnum will\r\nsometimes act like a charm.\r\n\r\n\r\n_HOW TO CURE SWELLED AND SORE BREASTS._\r\n\r\nTake and boil a quantity of chamomile, and apply the hot fomentations.\r\nThis dissolves the knot, and reduces the swelling and soreness.\r\n\r\n\r\n_LEUCORRHEA OR WHITES._\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.--This disorder, if not arising from some abnormal\r\ncondition of the pelvic organs, can easily be cured by patient taking\r\nthe proper amount of exercise and good nutritious food, avoiding tea\r\nand coffee. An injection every evening of one teaspoonful of Pond's\r\nExtract in a cup of hot water, after first cleansing the vagina well\r\nwith a quart of warm water, is a simple but effective remedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_INFLAMMATION OF THE WOMB._\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.--When in the acute form this disease is ushered in\r\nby a chill, followed by fever, and pain in the region of the womb.\r\nPatient should be placed in bed, and a brisk purgative given, hot\r\npoultices applied to the abdomen, and the feet and hands kept warm. If\r\nthe symptoms do not subside, a physician should be consulted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_HYSTERIA._\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.--A functional disorder of the nervous system of which it\r\nis impossible to speak definitely; characterized by disturbance of\r\nthe reason, will, imagination, and emotions, with sometimes convulsive\r\nattacks that resemble epilepsy.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--Fits of laughter, and tears without apparent cause;\r\nemotions easily excited; mind often melancholy and depressed;\r\ntenderness along the spine; disturbances, of digestion, with\r\nhysterical convulsions, and other nervous phenomena.\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.--Some healthy and pleasant employment should be urged\r\nupon women afflicted with this disease. Men are also subject to it,\r\nthough not so frequently. Avoid excessive fatigue and mental worry;\r\nalso stimulants and opiates. Plenty of good food and fresh air will do\r\nmore good than drugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFALLING OF THE WOMB.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSES.--The displacement of the womb usually is the result of too\r\nmuch childbearing, miscarriages, abortions, or the taking of strong\r\nmedicines to bring about menstruation. It may also be the result in\r\ngetting up too quickly from the childbed. There are, however, other\r\ncauses, such as a general breaking down of the health.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--If the womb has fallen forward it presses against the\r\nbladder, causing the patient to urinate frequently. If the womb has\r\nfallen back, it presses against the rectum, and constipation is the\r\nresult with often severe pain at stool. If the womb descends into\r\nthe vagina there is a feeling of heaviness. All forms of displacement\r\nproduce pain in the back, with an irregular and scanty menstrual flow\r\nand a dull and exhausted feeling.\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.--Improve the general health. Take some preparation of\r\ncod-liver oil, hot injections (of a teaspoonful of powdered alum with\r\na pint of water), a daily sitz-bath, and a regular morning bath three\r\ntimes a week will be found very beneficial. There, however, can be no\r\nremedy unless the womb is first replaced to the proper position.\r\nThis must be done by a competent physician who should frequently be\r\nconsulted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMENSTRUATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. ITS IMPORTANCE.--Menstruation plays a momentous part in the\r\nfemale economy; indeed, unless it be in every way properly and duly\r\nperformed, it is neither possible that a lady can be well, nor is it\r\nat all probable that she will conceive. The large number of barren, of\r\ndelicate, and of hysterical women there are in America arises mainly\r\nfrom menstruation not being duly and properly performed.\r\n\r\n2. THE BOUNDARY-LINE.--Menstruation--\"the periods\"--the appearance of\r\nthe catamenia or the menses--is then one of the most important epochs\r\nin a girl's life. It is the boundary-line, the landmark between\r\nchildhood and womanhood; it is the threshold, so to speak, of a\r\nwoman's life. Her body now develops and expands, and her mental\r\ncapacity enlarges and improves.\r\n\r\n3. THE COMMENCEMENT OF MENSTRUATION.--A good beginning at this time\r\nis peculiarly necessary, or a girl's health is sure to suffer and\r\ndifferent organs of the body--her lungs, for instance, may become\r\nimperiled. A healthy continuation, at regular periods, is also much\r\nneeded, or conception, when she is married, may not occur. Great\r\nattention and skillful management is required to ward off many\r\nformidable diseases, which at the close of menstruation--at \"the\r\nchange of life\"--are more likely than at any time to be developed. If\r\nshe marry when very young, marriage weakens her system, and prevents\r\na full development of her body. Moreover, such an one is, during the\r\nprogress of her labor, prone to convulsions--which is a very serious\r\nchildbed complication.\r\n\r\n4. EARLY MARRIAGES.--Statistics prove that twenty per cent--20 in\r\nevery 100--of females who marry are under age, and that such early\r\nmarriages are often followed by serious, and sometimes even by\r\nfatal consequences to mother, to progeny, or to both. Parents ought,\r\ntherefore, to persuade their daughters not to marry until they are\r\nof age--twenty-one; they should point out to them the risk and danger\r\nlikely to ensue if their advice be not followed; they should Impress\r\nupon their minds the old adage:\r\n\r\n  \"Early wed,\r\n  Early dead.\"\r\n\r\n5. TIME TO MARRY.--Parents who have the real interest and happiness\r\nof their daughters at heart, ought, in consonance with the laws of\r\nphysiology, to discountenance marriage before twenty; and the nearer\r\nthe girls arrive at the age of twenty-five before the consummation of\r\nthis important rite, the greater the probability that, physically and\r\nmorally, they will be protected against those risks which precocious\r\nmarriages bring in their train.\r\n\r\n6. FEEBLE PARENTS.--Feeble parents have generally feeble children;\r\ndiseased parents, diseased children; nervous parents, nervous\r\nchildren;--\"like begets like.\" It is sad to reflect, that the innocent\r\nhave to suffer, not only for the guilty, but for the thoughtless\r\nand inconsiderate. Disease and debility are thus propagated from\r\none generation to another and the American race becomes woefully\r\ndeteriorated.\r\n\r\n7. TIME.--Menstruation in this country usually commences at the ages\r\nof from thirteen to sixteen, sometimes earlier; occasionally as early\r\nas eleven or twelve; at other times later, and not until a girl be\r\nseventeen or eighteen years of age. Menstruation in large towns is\r\nsupposed to commence at an earlier period than in the country, and\r\nearlier in luxurious than in simple life.\r\n\r\n8. CHARACTER.--The menstrual fluid is not exactly blood, although,\r\nboth in appearance and properties, it much resembles it; yet it never\r\nin the healthy state clots as blood does. It is a secretion of\r\nthe womb, and, when healthy, ought to be of a bright red color in\r\nappearance very much like the blood from a recently cut finger. The\r\nmenstrual fluid ought not, as before observed, clot. If it does, a\r\nlady, during \"her periods,\" suffers intense pain; moreover, she seldom\r\nconceives until the clotting has ceased.\r\n\r\n9. MENSTRUATION DURING NURSING.--Some ladies, though comparatively\r\nfew, menstruate during nursing; when they do, it may be considered not\r\nas the rule, but as the exception. It is said in such instances,\r\nthat they are more likely to conceive; and no doubt they are, as\r\nmenstruation is an indication of a proneness to conception. Many\r\npersons have an idea that when a woman, during lactation, menstruates,\r\nher milk is both sweeter and purer. Such is an error. Menstruation\r\nduring nursing is more likely to weaken the mother, and consequently\r\nto deteriorate her milk, and thus make it less sweet and less pure.\r\n\r\n10. VIOLENT EXERCISE.--During \"the monthly periods\" violent exercise\r\nis injurious; iced drinks and acid beverages are improper; and bathing\r\nin the sea, and bathing the feet in cold water, and cold baths are\r\ndangerous; indeed, at such times as these, no risks should be run, and\r\nno experiments should, for the moment, be permitted, otherwise serious\r\nconsequences will, in all probability, ensue.\r\n\r\n11. THE PALE, COLORLESS-COMPLEXIONED.--The pale, colorless-complexioned,\r\nhelpless, listless, and almost lifeless young ladies who are so\r\nconstantly seen in society, usually owe their miserable state of\r\nhealth to absent, to deficient, or to profuse menstruation. Their\r\nbreathing is short--they are soon \"out of breath,\" if they attempt to\r\ntake exercise--to walk, for instance, either up stairs or up a hill,\r\nor even for half a mile on level ground, their breath is nearly\r\nexhausted--they pant as though they had been running quickly. They\r\nare ready, after the slightest exertion or fatigue, and after the\r\nleast worry or excitement, to feel faint, and sometimes even to\r\nactually swoon away. Now such cases may, if judiciously treated, be\r\ngenerally soon cured. It therefore behooves mothers to seek medical\r\naid early for their girls, and that before irreparable mischief has\r\nbeen done to the constitution.\r\n\r\n12. POVERTY OF BLOOD.--In a pale, delicate girl or wife, who is\r\nlaboring under what is popularly called poverty of blood, the\r\nmenstrual fluid is sometimes very scant, at others very copious, but\r\nis, in either case, usually very pale--almost as colorless as water,\r\nthe patient being very nervous and even hysterical. Now, these are\r\nsigns of great debility; but, fortunately for such an one, a medical\r\nman is, in the majority of cases, in possession of remedies that will\r\nsoon make her all right again.\r\n\r\n13. NO RIGHT TO MARRY.--A delicate girl has no right until she be made\r\nstrong, to marry. If she should marry, she will frequently, when in\r\nlabor, not have strength, unless she has help, to bring a child into\r\nthe world; which, provided she be healthy and well-formed, ought not\r\nto be. How graphically the Bible tells of delicate women not having\r\nstrength to bring children into the world: \"For the children are come\r\nto the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.\"--2 Kings XIX,\r\n3.\r\n\r\n14. TOO SPARING.--Menstruation at another time is too sparing; this is\r\na frequent cause of sterility. Medical aid, in the majority of cases,\r\nwill be able to remedy the defect, and, by doing so, will probably\r\nbe the means of bringing the womb into a healthy state, and thus\r\npredispose to conception.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCELEBRATED PRESCRIPTIONS FOR ALL DISEASES AND HOW TO USE THEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nVINEGAR FOR HIVES.\r\n\r\nAfter trying many remedies in a severe case of hives, Mr. Swain found\r\nvinegar lotion gave instant relief, and subsequent trials in other\r\ncases have been equally successful. One part of water to two parts of\r\nvinegar is the strength most suitable.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHROAT TROUBLE.\r\n\r\nA teaspoonful of salt, in a cup of hot water makes a safe and\r\nexcellent gargle in most throat troubles.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR SWEATING FEET, WITH BAD ODOR.\r\n\r\nWash the feet in warm water with borax, and if this don't cure, use\r\na solution of permanganate to destroy the fetor; about five grains to\r\neach ounce of water.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMENORRHOEA.\r\n\r\nThe following is recommended as a reliable emmenagogue in many cases\r\nof functional amenorrhoea:\r\n\r\n  Bichloride of mercury,\r\n  Arsenite of sodium, aa gr. iij.\r\n  Sulphate of strychnine, gr. iss.\r\n  Carbonate of potassium,\r\n  Sulphate of iron, aa gr. xlv.\r\n\r\nMix and divide into sixty pills. Sig. One pill after each meal.\r\n\r\n\r\nSICK HEADACHE.\r\n\r\nTake a spoonful of finely powdered charcoal in a small glass of warm\r\nwater to relieve a sick headache.\r\n\r\nIt absorbs the gasses produced by the fermentation of undigested food.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EXCELLENT EYE WASH.\r\n\r\n  Acetate of zinc, 20 grains.\r\n  Acetate of morphia, 5 grains.\r\n  Rose water, 4 ounces.    Mix.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR FILMS AND CATARACTS OF THE EYES.\r\n\r\n  Blood Root Pulverized, 1 ounce.\r\n  Hog's lard, 3 ounces.\r\n\r\nMix, simmer for 20 minutes, then strain; when cold put a little in the\r\neyes twice or three times a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR BURNS AND SORES.\r\n\r\n  Pitch Burgundy, 2 pounds.\r\n  Bees' Wax, 1 pound.\r\n  Hog's lard, one pound.\r\n\r\nMix all together and simmer over a slow fire until the whole are well\r\nmixed together; then stir it until cold. Apply on muslin to the parts\r\naffected.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR CHAPPED HANDS.\r\n\r\n  Olive oil, 6 ounces.\r\n  Camphor beat fine, 1/2 ounce.\r\n\r\nMix, dissolve by gentle heat over slow fire and when cold apply to the\r\nhand freely.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTOXICATION.\r\n\r\nA man who is helplessly intoxicated may almost immediately restore\r\nthe faculties and powers of locomotion by taking half a teaspoonful\r\nof chloride of ammonium in a goblet of water. A wineglassful of strong\r\nvinegar will have the same effect and is frequently resorted to by\r\ndrunken soldiers.\r\n\r\n\r\nNERVOUS DISABILITY, HEADACHE, NEURALGIA, NERVOUSNESS.\r\n\r\n  Fluid extract of scullcap, 1 ounce.\r\n  Fluid extract American valerian, 1 ounce.\r\n  Fluid extract catnip, 1 ounce.\r\n\r\nMix all. Dose, from 15 to 30 drops every two hours, in water; most\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\nA valuable tonic in all conditions of debility and want of appetite.\r\n\r\nComp. tincture of cinchona in teaspoonful doses in a little water,\r\nhalf hour before meals.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER EXCELLENT TONIC\r\n\r\n  Tincture of gentian, 1 ounce.\r\n  Tincture of Columba, 1 ounce.\r\n  Tincture of Collinsonia, 1 ounce.\r\n\r\nMix all. Dose, one tablespoonful in one tablespoonful of water before\r\nmeals.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMEDY FOR CHAPPED HANDS.\r\n\r\nWhen doing housework, if your hands become chapped or red, mix corn\r\nmeal and vinegar into a stiff paste and apply to the hands two or\r\nthree times a day, after washing them in hot water, then let dry\r\nwithout wiping, and rub with glycerine. At night use cold cream, and\r\nwear gloves.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLEEDING.\r\n\r\nVery hot water is a prompt checker of bleeding, besides if it is\r\nclean, as it should be, it aids in sterilizing our wound.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT FOR CRAMP.\r\n\r\nWherever friction can be conveniently applied, heat will be generated\r\nby it, and the muscle again reduced to a natural condition; but if the\r\npains proceed from the contraction of some muscle located internally,\r\nburnt brandy is an excellent remedy.\r\n\r\nA severe attack which will not yield to this simple treatment may be\r\nconquered by administering a small dose of laudanum or ether, best\r\ngiven under medical supervision.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT FOR COLIC\r\n\r\nCastor oil, given as soon as the symptoms of colic manifest\r\nthemselves, has frequently afforded relief. At any rate, the\r\nirritating substances must be expelled from the alimentary canal\r\nbefore the pains will subside. All local remedies will be ineffectual,\r\nand consequently the purgative should be given in large doses until a\r\ncopious vacuation is produced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DOCTOR'S VISIT.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT FOR HEARTBURN.\r\n\r\nIf soda, taken in small quantities after meals, does not relieve\r\nthe distress, one may rest assured that the fluid is an alkali and\r\nrequires an acid treatment. Proceed, after eating, to squeeze ten\r\ndrops of lemon-juice into a small quantity of water, and swallow\r\nit. The habit of daily life should be made to conform to the laws of\r\nhealth, or local treatment will prove futile.\r\n\r\n\r\nBILIOUSNESS.\r\n\r\nFor biliousness, squeeze the juice of a lime or small lemon into half\r\na glass of cold water, then stir in a little baking soda and drink\r\nwhile it foams. This receipt will also relieve sick headache if taken\r\nat the beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\nTURPENTINE APPLICATIONS.\r\n\r\nMix turpentine and lard in equal parts. Warmed and rubbed on the\r\nchest, it is a safe, reliable and mild counter irritant and revulsent\r\nin minor lung complications.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT FOR MUMPS.\r\n\r\nIt is very important that the face and neck be kept warm. Avoid\r\ncatching cold, and regulate the stomach and bowels; because when\r\naggravated, this disease is communicated to other glands, and assumes\r\nthere a serious form. Rest and quiet, with a good condition of\r\nthe general health, will throw off this disease without further\r\ninconvenience.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT FOR FELON.\r\n\r\nAll medication, such as poulticing, anointing, and the applications of\r\nlotions, is but useless waste of time. The surgeon's knife should be\r\nused as early as possible, for it will be required sooner or later and\r\nthe more promptly it can be applied, the less danger is there from the\r\ndisease, and the more agony is spared to the unfortunate victim.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT FOR STABS.\r\n\r\nA wound made by thrusting a dagger or other oblong instrument into\r\nthe flesh, is best treated, if no artery has been severed, by applying\r\nlint scraped from a linen cloth, which serves as an obstruction,\r\nallowing and assisting coagulation. Meanwhile cold water should be\r\napplied to the parts adjoining the wound.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT FOR MASHED NAILS.\r\n\r\nIf the injured member be plunged into very hot water the nail will\r\nbecome pliable and adapt itself to the new condition of things, thus\r\nalleviating agony to some extent. A small hole may be bored on the\r\nnail with a pointed instrument, so adroitly as not to cause pain, yet\r\nso successfully as to relieve pressure on the sensitive tissues. Free\r\napplications of arnica or iodine will have an excellent effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT FOR FOREIGN BODY IN THE EYE.\r\n\r\nWhen any foreign body enters the eye, close it instantly, and keep it\r\nstill until you have an opportunity to ask the assistance of some one;\r\nthen have the upper lid folded over a pencil and the exposed surfaces\r\nclosely searched; if the body be invisible, catch the everted lid by\r\nthe lashes, and drawing it down over the lower lid, suddenly release\r\nit, and it will resume its natural position. Unsuccessful in this\r\nattempt, you may be pretty well assured that the object has become\r\nlodged in the tissues, and will require the assistance of a skilled\r\noperator to remove it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUTS.\r\n\r\nA drop or two of creosote on a cut will stop its bleeding.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT FOR POISON OAK--POISON IVY--POISON SUMACH.--Mr. Charles\r\nMorris, of Philadelphia, who has studied the subject closely, uses, as\r\na sovereign remedy, frequent bathing of the affected parts in water\r\nas hot as can be borne. If used immediately after exposure, it may\r\nprevent the eruption appearing. If later, it allays the itching, and\r\ngradually dries up the swellings, though they are very stubborn after\r\nthey have once appeared. But an application every few hours keeps down\r\nthe intolerable itching, which is the most annoying feature of sumach\r\npoisoning. In addition to this, the ordinary astringent ointments are\r\nuseful, as is also that sovereign lotion, \"lead-water and laudanum.\"\r\nMr. Morris adds to these a preventive prescription of \"wide-open\r\neyes.\"\r\n\r\nBITES AND STINGS OF INSECTS.--Wash with a solution of ammonia water.\r\n\r\nBITES OF MAD DOGS.--Apply caustic potash at once to the wound, and\r\ngive enough whiskey to cause sleep.\r\n\r\nBURNS.--Make a paste of common baking soda and water, and apply it\r\npromptly to the burn. It will quickly check the pain and inflammation.\r\n\r\nCOLD ON CHEST.--A flannel rag wrung out in boiling water and sprinkled\r\nwith turpentine, laid on the chest, gives the greatest relief.\r\n\r\nCOUGH.--Boil one ounce of flaxseed in a pint of water, strain, and\r\nadd a little honey, one ounce of rock candy, and the juice of three\r\nlemons. Mix and boil well. Drink as hot as possible.\r\n\r\nSPRAINED ANKLE OR WRIST.--Wash the ankle very frequently with cold\r\nsalt and water, which is far better than warm vinegar or decoction of\r\nherbs. Keep the foot as cool as possible to prevent inflammation, and\r\nsit with it elevated on a high cushion. Live on low diet, and take\r\nevery morning some cooling medicine, such as Epsom salts. It cures in\r\na few days.\r\n\r\nCHILBLAINS, SPRAINS, ETC.--One raw egg well beaten, half a pint of\r\nvinegar, one ounce spirits of turpentine, a quarter of an ounce of\r\nspirits of wine, a quarter of an ounce of camphor. These ingredients\r\nto be beaten together, then put in a bottle and shaken for ten\r\nminutes, after which, to be corked down tightly to exclude the air. In\r\nhalf an hour it is fit for use. To be well rubbed in, two, three, or\r\nfour times a day. For rheumatism in the head, to be rubbed at the back\r\nof the neck and behind the ears. In chilblains this remedy is to be\r\nused before they are broken.\r\n\r\nHOW TO REMOVE SUPERFLUOUS HAIR.--Sulphuret of Arsenic, one ounce;\r\nQuicklime, one ounce; Prepared Lard, one ounce; White Wax, one ounce.\r\nMelt the Wax, add the Lard. When nearly cold, stir in the other\r\ningredients. Apply to the superfluous hair, allowing it to remain on\r\nfrom five to ten minutes; use a table-knife to shave off the hair;\r\nthen wash with soap and warm water.\r\n\r\nDYSPEPSIA CURE.--Powdered Rhubarb, two drachms: Bicarbonate of Sodium,\r\nsix drachms; Fluid Extract of Gentian, three drachms; Peppermint\r\nWater, seven and a half ounces. Mix them. Dose, a teaspoonful half an\r\nhour before meals.\r\n\r\nFOR NEURALGIA.--Tincture of Belladonna, one ounce; Tincture of\r\nCamphor, one ounce; Tincture of Arnica, one ounce; Tincture of Opium,\r\none ounce. Mix them. Apply over the seat of the pain, and give ten to\r\ntwenty drops in sweetened water every two hours.\r\n\r\nFOR COUGHS, COLDS, ETC.--Syrup of Morphia, three ounces; Syrup of Tar,\r\nthree and a half ounces; Chloroform, one troy ounce; Glycerine, one\r\ntroy ounce. Mix them. Dose, a teaspoonful three or four times a day.\r\n\r\nTO CURE HIVES.--Compound syrup of Squill, U.S., three ounces; Syrup of\r\nIpecac, U.S., one ounce. Mix them. Dose, a teaspoonful.\r\n\r\nTO CURE SICK HEADACHE.--Gather sumach leaves in the summer, and spread\r\nthem in the sun a few days to dry. Then powder them fine, and smoke,\r\nmorning and evening for two weeks, also whenever there are symptoms\r\nof approaching headache. Use a new clay pipe. If these directions are\r\nadhered to, this medicine will surely effect a permanent cure.\r\n\r\nWHOOPING COUGH.--Dissolve a scruple of salt of tartar in a gill of\r\nwater; add to it ten grains of cochineal; sweeten it with sugar. Give\r\nto an infant a quarter teaspoonful four times a day; two years old,\r\none-half teaspoonful; from four years, a tablespoonful. Great care is\r\nrequired in the administration of medicines to infants. We can assure\r\npaternal inquirers that the foregoing may be depended upon.\r\n\r\nCUT OR BRUISE.--Apply the moist surface of the inside coating or skin\r\nof the shell of a raw egg. It will adhere of itself, leave no scar,\r\nand heal without pain.\r\n\r\nDISINFECTANT.--Chloride of lime should be scattered at least once a\r\nweek under sinks and wherever sewer gas is likely to penetrate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE YOUNG DOCTOR.]\r\n\r\nCOSTIVENESS.--Common charcoal is highly recommended for costiveness.\r\nIt may be taken in tea- or tablespoonful, or even larger doses,\r\naccording to the exigencies of the case, mixed with molasses,\r\nrepeating it as often as necessary. Bathe the bowels with pepper and\r\nvinegar. Or take two ounces of rhubarb, add one ounce of rust of iron,\r\ninfuse in one quart of wine. Half a wineglassful every morning.\r\nOr take pulverized blood root, one drachm, pulverized rhubarb, one\r\ndrachm, castile soap, two scruples. Mix and roll into thirty-two\r\npills. Take one, morning and night. By following these directions it\r\nmay perhaps save you from a severe attack of the piles, or some other\r\nkindred disease.\r\n\r\nTO CURE DEAFNESS.--Obtain pure pickerel oil, and apply four drops\r\nmorning and evening to the ear. Great care should be taken to obtain\r\noil that is perfectly pure.\r\n\r\nDEAFNESS.--Take three drops of sheep's gall, warm and drop it into the\r\near on going to bed. The ear must be syringed with warm soap and water\r\nin the morning. The gall must be applied for three successive nights.\r\nIt is only efficacious when the deafness is produced by cold. The most\r\nconvenient way of warming the gall is by holding it in a silver spoon\r\nover the flame of a light. The above remedy has been frequently tried\r\nwith perfect success.\r\n\r\nGOUT.--This is Col. Birch's recipe for rheumatic gout or acute\r\nrheumatism, commonly called in England the \"Chelsea Pensioner.\" Half\r\nan ounce of nitre (saltpetre), half an ounce of sulphur, half an ounce\r\nof flour of mustard, half an ounce of Turkey rhubarb, quarter of an\r\nounce of powdered guaicum. Mix, and take a teaspoonful every other\r\nnight for three nights, and omit three nights, in a wineglassful of\r\ncold water which has been previously well boiled.\r\n\r\nRINGWORM.--The head is to be washed twice a day with soft soap and\r\nwarm soft water; when dried the places to be rubbed with a piece of\r\nlinen rag dipped in ammonia from gas tar; the patient should take a\r\nlittle sulphur and molasses, or some other genuine aperient, every\r\nmorning; brushes and combs should be washed every day, and the ammonia\r\nkept tightly corked.\r\n\r\nPILES.--Hamamelis, both internally or as an injection in rectum. Bathe\r\nthe parts with cold water or with astringent lotions, as alum water,\r\nespecially in bleeding piles. Ointment of gallic acid and calomel is\r\nof repute. The best treatment of all is, suppositories of iodoform,\r\nergotine, of tannic acid, which can be made at any drug store.\r\n\r\nCHICKEN POX.--No medicine is usually needed, except a tea made\r\nfrom pleurisy root, to make the child sweat. Milk diet is the best;\r\navoidance of animal food; careful attention to the bowels; keep cool\r\nand avoid exposure to cold.\r\n\r\nSCARLET FEVER.--Cold water compress on the throat. Fats and oils\r\nrubbed on hands and feet. The temperature of the room should be\r\nabout 68 degrees Fahr., and all draughts avoided. Mustard baths for\r\nretrocession of the rash and to bring it out. Diet: ripe fruit,\r\ntoast, gruel, beef, tea and milk. Stimulants are useful to counteract\r\ndepression of the vital forces.\r\n\r\nFALSE MEASLES OR ROSE RASH.--It requires no treatment except hygienic.\r\nKeep the bowels open. Nourishing diet, and if there is itching,\r\nmoisten the skin with five per cent. solution of aconite or solution\r\nof starch and water.\r\n\r\nBILIOUS ATTACKS.--Drop doses of muriatic acid in a wine glass of water\r\nevery four hours, or the following prescription: Bicarbonate of soda,\r\none drachm; Aromatic spirits of ammonia, two drachms; Peppermint\r\nwater, four ounces. Dose: Take a teaspoonful every four hours.\r\n\r\nDIARRHOEA.--The following prescription is generally all that will be\r\nnecessary: acetate of lead, eight grains; gum arabic, two drachms;\r\nacetate of morphia, one grain; and cinnamon water, eight ounces. Take\r\na teaspoonful every three hours.\r\n\r\nBe careful not to eat too much food. Some consider, the best treatment\r\nis to fast, and it is a good suggestion. Patients should keep quiet\r\nand have the room of a warm and even temperature.\r\n\r\nVOMITING.--Ice dissolved in the mouth, often cures vomiting when all\r\nremedies fail. Much depends on the diet of persons liable to such\r\nattacts; this should be easily digestible food, taken often and in\r\nsmall quantities. Vomiting can often be arrested by applying a mustard\r\npaste over the region of the stomach. It is not necessary to allow it\r\nto remain until the parts are blistered, but it may be removed when\r\nthe part becomes thoroughly red, and reapplied if required after the\r\nredness has disappeared. One of the secrets to relieve vomiting is to\r\ngive the stomach perfect rest, not allowing the patient even a glass\r\nof water, as long as the tendency remains to throw it up again.\r\n\r\nNERVOUS HEADACHE.--Extract hyoscymus five grains, pulverized camphor\r\nfive grains. Mix. Make four pills, one to be taken when the pain is\r\nmost severe in nervous headache. Or three drops tincture nux vomica in\r\na spoonful of water, two or three times a day.\r\n\r\nBLEEDING FROM THE NOSE.--from whatever cause--may generally be stopped\r\nby putting a plug of lint into the nostril; if this does not do, apply\r\na cold lotion to the forehead; raise the head and place both arms\r\nover the head, so that it will rest on both hands; dip the lint plug,\r\nslightly moistened, in some powdered gum arabic, and plug the nostrils\r\nagain; or dip the plug into equal parts of gum arabic and alum. An\r\neasier and simpler method is to place a piece of writing paper on the\r\ngums of the upper jaw, under the upper lip, and let it remain there\r\nfor a few minutes.\r\n\r\nBOILS.--These should be brought to a head by warm poultices of\r\ncamomile flowers, or boiled white lily root, or onion root, by\r\nfermentation with hot water, or by stimulating plasters. When ripe\r\nthey should be destroyed by a needle or lancet. But this should not be\r\nattempted until they are thoroughly proved.\r\n\r\nBUNIONS may be checked in their early development by binding the joint\r\nwith adhesive plaster, and keeping it on as long as any uneasiness is\r\nfelt. The bandaging should be perfect, and it might be well to extend\r\nit round the foot An inflamed bunion should be poulticed, and larger\r\nshoes be worn. Iodine 12 grains, lard or spermaceti ointment half an\r\nounce, makes a capital ointment for bunions. It should be rubbed on\r\ngently twice or three times a day.\r\n\r\nFELONS.--One table-spoonful of red lead, and one tablespoonful of\r\ncastile soap, and mix them with as much weak lye as will make it soft\r\nenough to spread like a salve, and apply it on the first appearance of\r\nthe felon, and it will cure in ten or twelve days.\r\n\r\nCARE FOR WARTS.--The easiest way to get rid of warts, is to pare off\r\nthe thickened skin which covers the prominent wart; cut it off by\r\nsuccessive layers and shave it until you come to the surface of the\r\nskin, and till you draw blood in two or three places. Then rub the\r\npart thoroughly over with lunar caustic, and one effective operation\r\nof this kind will generally destroy the wart; if not, you cut off\r\nthe black spot which has been occasioned by the caustic, and apply it\r\nagain; or you may apply acetic acid, and thus you will get rid of it.\r\nCare must be taken in applying these acids, not to rub them on the\r\nskin around the wart.\r\n\r\nWENS.--Take the yoke of some eggs, beat up, and add as much fine salt\r\nas will dissolve, and apply a plaster to the wen every ten hours. It\r\ncures without pain or any other inconvenience.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHOW TO CURE APOPLEXY, BAD BREATH AND QUINSY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. APOPLEXY.--Apoplexy occurs only in the corpulent or obese, and\r\nthose of gross or high living.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_--Raise the head to a nearly upright position; loosen all\r\ntight clothes, strings, etc., and apply cold water to the head and\r\nwarm water and warm cloths to the feet. Have the apartment cool and\r\nwell ventilated. Give nothing by the mouth until the breathing is\r\nrelieved, and then only draughts of cold water.\r\n\r\n2. BAD BREATH.--Bad or foul breath will be removed by taking a\r\nteaspoonful of the following mixture after each meal: One ounce\r\nchloride of soda, one ounce liquor of potassa, one and one-half ounces\r\nphosphate of soda, and three ounces of water.\r\n\r\n3. QUINSY.--This is an inflammation of the tonsils, or common\r\ninflammatory sore throat; commences with a slight feverish attack,\r\nwith considerable pain and swelling of the tonsils, causing some\r\ndifficulty in swallowing; as the attack advances, these symptoms\r\nbecome more intense, there is headache, thirst, a painful sense of\r\ntension, and acute darting pains in the ears. The attack is generally\r\nbrought on by exposure to cold, and lasts from five to seven days,\r\nwhen it subsides naturally, or an abscess may form in tonsils and\r\nburst, or the tonsils may remain enlarged, the inflammation subsiding.\r\n\r\n_Home Treatment._--The patient should remain in a warm room, the diet\r\nchiefly milk and good broths, some cooling laxative and diaphoretic\r\nmedicine may be given; but the greatest relief will be found in the\r\nfrequent inhalation of the steam of hot water through an inhaler, or\r\nin the old-fashioned way through the spout of a teapot.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSENSIBLE RULES FOR THE NURSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Remember to be extremely neat in dress; a few drops of hartshorn in\r\nthe water used for _daily_ bathing will remove the disagreeable odors\r\nof warmth and perspiration.\r\n\r\n\"Never speak of the symptoms of your patient in his presence,\r\nunless questioned by the doctor, whose orders you are always to obey\r\n_implicitly_.\r\n\r\n\"Remember never to be a gossip or tattler, and always to hold sacred\r\nthe knowledge which, to a certain extent, you must obtain of the\r\nprivate affairs of your patient and the household in which you nurse.\r\n\r\n\"Never contradict your patient, nor argue with him, nor let him see\r\nthat you are annoyed about anything.\r\n\r\n\"Never _whisper_ in the sick room. If your patient be well enough, and\r\nwishes you to talk to him, speak in a low, distinct voice, on cheerful\r\nsubjects. Don't relate painful hospital experiences, nor give details\r\nof the maladies of former patients, and remember never to startle him\r\nwith accounts of dreadful crimes or accidents that you have read in\r\nthe newspapers.\r\n\r\n\"_Write_ down the orders that the physician gives you as to time for\r\ngiving the medicines, food, etc.\r\n\r\n\"Keep the room bright (unless the doctor orders it darkened).\r\n\r\n\"Let the air of the room be as pure as possible, and keep everything\r\nin order, but without being fussy and bustling.\r\n\r\n\"The only way to remove dust in a sick room is to wipe everything with\r\na damp cloth.\r\n\r\n\"Remember to carry out all vessels covered. Empty and wash them\r\nimmediately, and keep some disinfectant in them.\r\n\r\n\"Remember that to leave the patient's untasted food by his side, from\r\nmeal to meal, in hopes that he will eat it in the interval, is simply\r\nto prevent him from taking any food at all.\r\n\r\n\"Medicines, beef tea or stimulants, should never be kept where the\r\npatient can see them or smell them.\r\n\r\n\"Light-colored clothing should be worn by those who have the care of\r\nthe sick, in preference to dark-colored apparel; particularly if the\r\ndisease is of a contagious nature. Experiments have shown that black\r\nand other dark colors will absorb more readily the subtle effluvia\r\nthat emanates from sick persons than white or light colors.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLONGEVITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following table exhibits very recent mortality statistics, showing\r\nthe average duration of life among persons of various classes:\r\n\r\n  Employment.

THE HOT WATER THROAT BAG. The hot water throat bag is made\r\nfrom fine white rubber fastened to the head by a rubber band (see\r\nillustration), and is an unfailing remedy for catarrh, hay fever,\r\ncold, toothache, headache, earache, neuralgia, etc.\r\n\r\n2. THE HOT WATER BOTTLE. No well regulated house should be without a\r\nhot water bottle. It is excellent in the application of hot water for\r\ninflammations, colic, headache, congestion, cold feet, rheumatism,\r\nsprains, etc., etc. It is an excellent warming pan and an excellent\r\nfeet and hand warmer when riding. These hot water bags in any variety\r\ncan be purchased at any drug store.\r\n\r\n3. Boiling water may be used in the bags and the heat will be retained\r\nmany hours. They are soft and pliable and pleasant to the touch, and\r\ncan be adjusted to any part of the body.\r\n\r\n4. Hot water is good for constipation, torpid liver and relieves colic\r\nand flatulence, and is of special value.\r\n\r\n5. _Caution._ When hot water bags or any hot fomentation is removed,\r\nreplace dry flannel and bathe parts in tepid water and rub till dry.\r\n\r\n6. By inflammations it is best to use hot water and then cold water.\r\nIt seems to give more immediate relief. Hot water is a much better\r\nremedy than drugs, paragoric, Dover's powder or morphine. Always avoid\r\nthe use of strong poisonous drugs when possible.\r\n\r\n7. Those who suffer from cold feet there is no better remedy than\r\nto bathe the feet in cold water before retiring and then place a hot\r\nwater bottle in the bed at the feet. A few weeks of such treatment\r\nresults in relief if not cure of the most obstinate case.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO USE COLD WATER.\r\n\r\nUse a compress of cold water for acute or chronic inflammation, such\r\nas sore throat, bronchitis, croup, inflammation of the lungs, etc. If\r\nthere is a hot and aching pain in the back apply a compress of cold\r\nwater on the same, or it may simply be placed across the back or\r\naround the body. The most depends upon the condition of the patient.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL RULES FOR BATHING.\r\n\r\n1. Bathe at least once a week all over, thoroughly. No one can\r\npreserve his health by neglecting personal cleanliness. Remember,\r\n\"Cleanliness is akin to Godliness.\"\r\n\r\n2. Only mild soap should be used in bathing the body.\r\n\r\n3. Wipe quickly and dry the body thoroughly with a moderately coarse\r\ntowel. Rub the skin vigorously.\r\n\r\n4. Many people have contracted severe and fatal diseases by neglecting\r\nto take proper care of the body after bathing.\r\n\r\n5. If you get up a good reaction by thorough rubbing in a mild\r\ntemperature, the effect is always good.\r\n\r\n6. Never go into a cold room, or allow cold air to enter the room\r\nuntil you are dressed.\r\n\r\n7. Bathing in cold rooms and in cold water is positively injurious,\r\nunless the person possesses a very strong and vigorous constitution,\r\nand then there is great danger of laying the foundation of some\r\nserious disease.\r\n\r\n8. Never bathe within two hours after eating. It injures digestion.\r\n\r\n9. Never bathe when the body or mind is much exhausted. It is liable\r\nto check the healthful circulation.\r\n\r\n10. A good time for bathing is just before retiring. The morning hour\r\nis a good time also, if a warm room and warm water can be secured.\r\n\r\n11. Never bathe a fresh wound or broken skin with cold water; the\r\nwound absorbs water, and causes swelling and irritation.\r\n\r\n12. A person not robust should be very careful in bathing; great care\r\nshould be exercised to avoid any chilling effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF BATHS, AND HOW TO PREPARE THEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SULPHUR BATH.\r\n\r\nFor the itch, ringworm, itching, and for other slight irritations,\r\nbathe in water containing a little sulphur.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SALT BATH.\r\n\r\nTo open the pores of the skin, put a little common salt into the\r\nwater. Borax, baking soda or lime used in the same way are excellent\r\nfor cooling and cleansing the skin. A very small quantity in a bowl of\r\nwater is sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VAPOR BATH.\r\n\r\n1. For catarrh, bronchitis, pleurisy, inflammation of the lungs,\r\nrheumatism, fever, affections of the bowels and kidneys, and skin\r\ndiseases, the vapor-bath is an excellent remedy.\r\n\r\n2. APPARATUS.--Use a small alcohol lamp, and place over it a small\r\ndish containing water. Light the lamp and allow the water to boil.\r\nPlace a cane bottom chair over the lamp, and seat the patient on\r\nit. Wrap blankets or quilts around the chair and around the patient,\r\nclosing it tightly about the neck. After free perspiration is produced\r\nthe patient should be wrapped in warm blankets, and placed in bed, so\r\nas to continue the perspiration for some time.\r\n\r\n3. A convenient alcohol lamp may be made by taking a tin box, placing\r\na tube in it, and putting in a common lamp wick. Any tinner can make\r\none in a few minutes, at a trifling cost.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOT-AIR BATH.\r\n\r\n1. Place the alcohol lamp under the chair, without the dish of water.\r\nThen place the patient on the chair, as in the vapor bath, and let him\r\nremain until a gentle and free perspiration is produced. This bath may\r\nbe taken from time to time, as may be deemed necessary.\r\n\r\n2. While remaining in the hot-air bath the patient may drink freely of\r\ncold or tepid water.\r\n\r\n3. As soon as the bath is over the patient should be washed with hot\r\nwater and soap.\r\n\r\n4. The hot-air bath is excellent for colds, skin diseases, and the\r\ngout.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPONGE BATH.\r\n\r\n1. Have a large basin of water of the temperature of 85 or 95 degrees.\r\nAs soon as the patient rises rub the body over with a soft, dry towel\r\nuntil it becomes warm.\r\n\r\n2. Now sponge the body with water and a little soap, at the same time\r\nkeeping the body well covered, except such portions as are necessarily\r\nexposed. Then dry the skin carefully with a soft, warm towel. Rub the\r\nskin well for two or three minutes, until every part becomes red and\r\nperfectly dry.\r\n\r\n3. Sulphur, lime or salt, and sometimes mustard, may be used in any of\r\nthe sponge baths, according to the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOOT BATH.\r\n\r\n1. The foot bath, in coughs, colds, asthma, headaches and fevers,\r\nis excellent. One or two tablespoonfuls of ground mustard added to a\r\ngallon of hot water, is very beneficial.\r\n\r\n2. Heat the water as hot as the patient can endure it, and gradually\r\nincrease the temperature by pouring in additional quantities of hot\r\nwater during the bath.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SITZ BATH.\r\n\r\nA tub is arranged so that the patient can sit down in it while\r\nbathing. Fill the tub about one-half full of water. This is an\r\nexcellent remedy for piles, constipation, headache, gravel, and for\r\nacute and inflammatory affections generally.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ACID BATH.\r\n\r\nPlace a little vinegar in water, and heat to the usual temperature.\r\nThis is an excellent remedy for the disorders of the liver.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SURE CURE FOR PRICKLY HEAT.\r\n\r\n1. Prickly heat is caused by hot weather, by excess of flesh, by rough\r\nflannels, by sudden changes of temperature, or by over-fatigue.\r\n\r\n2. TREATMENT--Bathe two or three times a day with warm water, in which\r\na moderate quantity of bran and common soda has been stirred. After\r\nwiping the skin dry, dust the affected parts with common cornstarch.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDIGESTIBILITY OF FOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE OF FOOD; CONDITION; HOURS REQUIRED\r\n\r\n  Rice; Boiled; 1.00\r\n  Eggs, whipped; Raw; 1.30\r\n  Trout, salmon, fresh; Boiled; 1.30\r\n  Apples, sweet and mellow; Raw; 1.30\r\n  Venison steak; Broiled; 1.35\r\n  Tapioca; Boiled; 2.00\r\n  Barley; Boiled; 2.00\r\n  Milk; Boiled; 2.00\r\n  Bullock's liver, fresh; Broiled; 2.00\r\n  Fresh eggs; Raw; 2.00\r\n  Codfish, cured and dry; Boiled; 2.00\r\n  Milk; Raw; 2.15\r\n  Wild turkey; Roasted; 2.15\r\n  Domestic turkey; Roasted; 2.30;\r\n  Goose; Roasted; 2.30\r\n  Suckling pig; Roasted; 2.30\r\n  Fresh Lamb; Broiled; 2.30\r\n  Hash, meat and vegetables; Warmed; 2.30\r\n  Beans and pod; Boiled; 2.30\r\n  Parsnips; Boiled; 2.30\r\n  Irish potatoes; Roasted; 2.30\r\n  Chicken; Fricassee; 2.45\r\n  Custard; Baked; 2.45\r\n  Salt beef; Boiled; 2.45\r\n  Sour and hard apples; Raw; 2.50\r\n  Fresh oysters; Raw; 2.55\r\n  Fresh eggs; Soft Boiled; 3.00\r\n  Beef, fresh, lean and rare; Roasted; 3.00\r\n  Beef steak; Broiled; 3.00\r\n  Pork, recently salted; Stewed; 3.00\r\n  Fresh mutton; Boiled; 3.00\r\n  Soup, beans; Boiled; 3.00\r\n  Soup, chicken; Boiled; 3.00\r\n  Apple dumpling; Boiled; 3.00\r\n  Fresh oysters; Roasted; 3.15\r\n  Pork steak; Broiled; 3.15\r\n  Fresh mutton; Roasted; 3.15\r\n  Corn bread; Baked; 3.15\r\n  Carrots; Boiled; 3.15\r\n  Fresh sausage; Broiled; 3.20\r\n  Fresh flounder; Fried; 3.30\r\n  Fresh catfish; Fried; 3.30\r\n  Fresh oysters; Stewed; 3.30\r\n  Butter; Melted; 3.30\r\n  Old, strong cheese; Raw; 3.30\r\n  Mutton soup; Boiled; 3.30\r\n  Oyster soup; Boiled; 3.30\r\n  Fresh wheat bread; Baked; 3.30\r\n  Flat turnips; Boiled; 3.30\r\n  Irish potatoes; Boiled; 3.30\r\n  Fresh eggs; Hard boiled; 3.30\r\n  Fresh eggs; Fried; 3.30\r\n  Green corn and beans; Boiled; 3.45\r\n  Beets, Boiled; 3.45\r\n  Fresh, lean beef; Fried; 4.00\r\n  Fresh veal; Broiled; 4.00\r\n  Domestic fowls; Roasted; 4.00\r\n  Ducks, Roasted; 4.00\r\n  Beef soup, vegetables and bread Boiled; 4.00\r\n  Pork, recently salted; Boiled; 4.30\r\n  Fresh veal; Fried; 4.30\r\n  Cabbage, with vinegar; Boiled; 4.30\r\n  Pork, fat and lean; Roasted; 5.30\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHOW TO COOK FOR THE SICK.\r\n\r\nUseful Dietetic Recipes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRUELS.\r\n\r\n1.

PUBLIC BALLS.--The church should turn its face like flint against\r\nthe public ball. Its influence is evil, and nothing but evil. It is\r\na well known fact that in all cities and large towns the ball room is\r\nthe recruiting office for prostitution.\r\n\r\n2. THOUGHTLESS YOUNG WOMEN.--In cities public balls are given every\r\nnight, and many thoughtless young women, mostly the daughters of small\r\ntradesmen and mechanics, or clerks or laborers, are induced to attend\r\n\"just for fun.\" Scarcely one in a hundred of the girls attending these\r\nballs preserve their purity. They meet the most desperate characters,\r\nprofessional gamblers, criminals and the lowest debauchees. Such\r\nan assembly and such influence cannot mean anything but ruin for an\r\ninnocent girl.\r\n\r\n3. VILE WOMEN.--The public ball is always a resort of vile women who\r\npicture to innocent girls the ease and luxury of a harlot's life, and\r\noffer them all manner of temptations to abandon the paths of virtue.\r\nThe public ball is the resort of the libertine and the adulterer, and\r\nwhose object is to work the ruin of every innocent girl that may fall\r\ninto their clutches.\r\n\r\n4. THE QUESTION.--Why does society wonder at the increase of\r\nprostitution, when the public balls and promiscuous dancing is so\r\nlargely endorsed and encouraged?\r\n\r\n5. WORKING GIRLS.--Thousands of innocent working girls enter\r\ninnocently and unsuspectingly into the paths which lead them to the\r\nhouse of evil, or who wander the streets as miserable outcasts all\r\nthrough the influence of the dance. The low theatre and dance halls\r\nand other places of unselected gatherings are the milestones which\r\nmark the working girl's downward path from virtue to vice, from\r\nmodesty to shame.\r\n\r\n6. THE SALESWOMAN, the seamstress, the factory girl or any other\r\nvirtuous girl had better, far better, die than take the first step in\r\nthe path of impropriety and danger. Better, a thousand times better,\r\nbetter for this life, better for the life to come, an existence of\r\nhumble, virtuous industry than a single departure from virtue, even\r\nthough it were paid with a fortune.\r\n\r\n7. TEMPTATIONS.--There is not a young girl but what is more or less\r\ntempted by some unprincipled wretch who may have the reputation of a\r\ngenteel society man. It behooves parents to guard carefully the morals\r\nof their daughters, and be vigilant and cautious in permitting them\r\nto accept the society of young men. Parents who desire to save their\r\ndaughters from a fate which is worse than death, should endeavor\r\nby every means in their power to keep them from falling into traps\r\ncunningly devised by some cunning lover. There are many good young\r\nmen, but not all are safe friends to an innocent, confiding young\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\n8. PROSTITUTION.--Some girls inherit their vicious tendency; others\r\nfall because of misplaced affections; many sin through a love of\r\ndress, which is fostered by society and by the surroundings amidst\r\nwhich they may be placed; many, very many, embrace a life of shame to\r\nescape poverty While each of these different phases of prostitution\r\nrequire a different remedy, we need better men, better women, better\r\nlaws and better protection for the young girls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A RUSSIAN SPINNING GIRL.]\r\n\r\n9. A STARTLING FACT.--Startling as it may seem to some, it is a fact\r\nin our large cities that there are many girls raised by parents with\r\nno other aim than to make them harlots. At a tender age they are sold\r\nby fathers and mothers into an existence which is worse than slavery\r\nitself. It is not uncommon to see girls at the tender age of thirteen\r\nor fourteen--mere children--hardened courtesans, lost to all sense\r\nof shame and decency. They are reared in ignorance, surrounded by\r\ndemoralizing influences, cut off from the blessings of church and\r\nSabbath school, see nothing but licentiousness, intemperance and\r\ncrime. These young girls are lost forever. They are beyond the reach\r\nof the moralist or preacher and have no comprehension of modesty and\r\npurity. Virtue to them is a stranger, and has been from the cradle.\r\n\r\n10. A GREAT WRONG.--Parents too poor to clothe themselves bring\r\nchildren into the world, children for whom they have no bread,\r\nconsequently the girl easily falls a victim in early womanhood to the\r\nheartless libertine. The boy with no other schooling but that of\r\nthe streets soon masters all the qualifications for a professional\r\ncriminal. If there could be a law forbidding people to marry who have\r\nno visible means of supporting a family, or if they should marry, if\r\ntheir children could be taken from them and properly educated by the\r\nState, it would cost the country less and be a great step in advancing\r\nour civilization.\r\n\r\n11. THE FIRST STEP.--Thousands of fallen women could have been saved\r\nfrom lives of degradation and deaths of shame had they received more\r\ntoleration and loving forgiveness in their first steps of error. Many\r\nwomen naturally pure and virtuous have fallen to the lowest depths\r\nbecause discarded by friends, frowned upon by society, and sneered at\r\nby the world, after they had taken a single mis-step. Society forgives\r\nman, but woman never.\r\n\r\n12. IN THE BEGINNING of every girl's downward career there is\r\nnecessarily a hesitation. She naturally ponders over what course\r\nto take, dreading to meet friends and looking into the future with\r\nhorror. That moment is the vital turning point in her career; a kind\r\nword of forgiveness, a mother's embrace a father's welcome may\r\nsave her. The bloodhounds, known as the seducer, the libertine, the\r\nprocurer, are upon her track; she is trembling on the frightful brink\r\nof the abyss. Extend a helping hand and save her!\r\n\r\n13. FATHER, if your daughter goes astray, do not drive her from your\r\nhome. Mother, if your child errs, do not close your heart against her.\r\nSisters and brothers and friends, do not force her into the pathway of\r\nshame, but rather strive to win her back into the Eden of virtue, an\r\nin nine cases out of ten you will succeed.\r\n\r\n14. SOCIETY EVILS.--The dance, the theater, the wine-cup, the\r\nrace-course, the idle frivolity and luxury of summer watering places,\r\nall have a tendency to demoralize the young.\r\n\r\n15. BAD SOCIETY.--Much of our modern society admits libertines and\r\nseducers to the drawing-room, while it excludes their helpless and\r\ndegraded victims, consequently it is not strange that there are\r\nskeletons in many closets, matrimonial infelicity and wayward girls.\r\n\r\n16. \"'KNOW THYSELF,'\" says Dr. Saur, \"is an important maxim for us\r\nall, and especially is it true for girls.\r\n\r\n\"All are born with the desire to become attractive girls especially\r\nwant to grow up, not only attractive, but beautiful. Some girls\r\nthink that bright eyes, pretty hair and fine clothes alone make them\r\nbeautiful. This is not so. Real beauty depends upon good health, good\r\nmanners and a pure mind.\r\n\r\n\"As the happiness of our girls depends upon their health, it behoves\r\nus all to guide the girls in such a way as to bring forward the best\r\nof results.\r\n\r\n17. \"THERE IS NO ONE who stands so near the girl as the mother. From\r\nearly childhood she occupies the first place in the little one's\r\nconfidence she laughs, plays, and corrects, when necessary, the faults\r\nof her darling. She should be equally ready to guide in the important\r\nlaws of life and health upon which rest her future. Teach your\r\ndaughters that in all things the 'creative principle' has its source\r\nin life itself. It originates from Divine life, and when they know\r\nthat it may be consecrated to wise and useful purposes, they are never\r\napt to grow up with base thoughts or form bad habits. Their lives\r\nbecome a happiness to themselves and a blessing to humanity.\r\n\r\n18. TEACH WISELY.--\"Teach your daughters that _all life_ originates\r\nfrom a seed a germ. Knowing this law, you need have no fears that base\r\nor unworthy thoughts of the reproductive function can ever enter their\r\nminds. The growth, development and ripening of human seed becomes a\r\nbeautiful and sacred mystery. The tree, the rose and all plant life\r\nare equally as mysterious and beautiful in their reproductive life.\r\nDoes not this alone prove to us, conclusively, that there is a\r\nDivinity in the background governing, controlling and influencing our\r\nlives? Nature has no secrets, and why should we? None at all. The only\r\ncare we should experience is in teaching wisely.\r\n\r\n\"Yes lead them wisely teach them that the seed, the germ of a new\r\nlife, is maturing within them. Teach them that between the ages of\r\neleven and fourteen this maturing process has certain physical signs.\r\nThe breasts grow round and full, the whole body, even the voice,\r\nundergoes a change. It is right that they should be taught the natural\r\nlaw of life in reproduction and the physiological structure of their\r\nbeing. Again we repeat that these lessons should be taught by the\r\nmother, and in a tender, delicate and confidential way. Become, oh,\r\nmother, your daughter's companion, and she will not go elsewhere for\r\nthis knowledge which must come to all in time, but possibly too late\r\nand through sources that would prove more harm than good.\r\n\r\n19. THE ORGANS OF CREATIVE LIFE in women are: Ovaries, Fallopian\r\ntubes, uterus, vagina and mammary glands. The _ovaries_ and _Fallopian\r\ntubes_ have already been described under \"The Female Generative\r\nOrgans.\"\r\n\r\n\"The _uterus_ is a pear-shaped muscular organ, situated in the lower\r\nportion of the pelvis, between the bladder and the rectum. It is\r\nless than three inches in length and two inches in width and one in\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\n\"The _vagina_ is a membranous canal which joins the internal outlet\r\nwith the womb, which projects slightly into it. The opening into the\r\nvagina is nearly oval, and in those who have never indulged in sexual\r\nintercourse or in handling the sexual organs is more or less closed\r\nby a membrane termed the _hymen_. The presence of this membrane was\r\nformerly considered as undoubted evidence of virginity; its absence, a\r\nlack of chastity.\r\n\r\n\"The _mammary glands_ are accessory to the generative organs. They\r\nsecrete milk, which the All-wise Gatherer provided for the nourishment\r\nof the child after birth.\r\n\r\n20. \"MENSTRUATION, which appears about the age of thirteen years,\r\nis the flow from the uterus that occurs every month as the seed-germ\r\nripens in the ovaries. God made the sexual organs so that the race\r\nshould not die out. He gave them to us so that we may reproduce\r\nlife, and thus fill the highest position in the created universe. The\r\npurpose for which they are made is high and holy and honorable, and if\r\nthey are used only for this purpose and they must not be used at\r\nall until they are fully matured they will be a source of greatest\r\nblessing to us all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TWO PATHS--WHAT WILL THE GIRL BECOME?\r\n\r\nAT 13: BAD LITERATURE\r\nAT 20: FLIRTING & COQUETTERY\r\nAT 26: FAST LIFE & DISSIPATION\r\nAT 40: AN OUTCAST\r\n\r\nAT 13: STUDY & OBEDIENCE\r\nAT 20: VIRTUE & DEVOTION\r\nAT 26: A LOVING MOTHER\r\nAT 60: AN HONORED GRANDMOTHER]\r\n\r\n21. \"A CAREFUL STUDY of this organ, of its location, of its arteries\r\nand nerves, will convince the growing girl that her body should never\r\nsubmit to corsets and tight lacing in response to the demands of\r\nfashion, even though nature has so bountifully provided for the safety\r\nof this important organ. By constant pressure the vagina and womb may\r\nbe compressed into one-third their natural length or crowded into an\r\nunnatural position. We can readily see, then, the effect of lacing\r\nor tight clothing. Under these circumstances the ligaments lose their\r\nelasticity, and as a result we have prolapsus or falling of the womb.\r\n\r\n22. \"I AM MORE ANXIOUS for growing girls than for any other earthly\r\nobject. These girls are to be the mothers of future generations; upon\r\nthem hangs the destiny of the world in coming time, and if they can\r\nbe made to understand what is right and what is wrong with regard to\r\ntheir own bodies now, while they are young, the children they will\r\ngive birth to and the men and women who shall call them mother will\r\nbe of a higher type and belong to a nobler class than those of the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\n23. \"ALL WOMEN CANNOT have good features, but they can look well, and\r\nit is possible to a great extent to correct deformity and develop much\r\nof the figure. The first step to good looks is good health, and the\r\nfirst element of health is cleanliness. Keep clean wash freely, bathe\r\nregularly. All the skin wants is leave to act, and it takes care of\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n24. \"GIRLS SOMETIMES GET THE IDEA that it is nice to be 'weak' and\r\n'delicate,' but they cannot get a more false idea! God meant women to\r\nbe strong and able-bodied, and only by being so can they be happy and\r\ncapable of imparting happiness to others. It is only by being strong\r\nand healthy that they can be perfect in their sexual nature; and It is\r\nonly by being perfect in this part of their being that you can become\r\na noble, grand and beautiful woman.\r\n\r\n25. \"UP TO THE AGE of puberty, if the girl has grown naturally, waist,\r\nhips and shoulders are about the same in width, the shoulders being,\r\nperhaps, a trifle the broadest. Up to this time the sexual organs have\r\ngrown but little. Now they take a sudden start and need more room.\r\nNature aids the girls; the tissues and muscles increase in size and\r\nthe pelvis bones enlarge. The limbs grow plump, the girl stops growing\r\ntall and becomes round and full. Unsuspected strength comes to her;\r\ntasks that were once hard to perform are now easy; her voice becomes\r\nsweeter and stronger. The mind develops more rapidly even than the\r\nbody; her brain is more active and quicker; subjects that once were\r\ndull and dry have unwonted interest; lessons are more easily learned;\r\nthe eyes sparkle with intelligence, indicating increased mental power;\r\nher manner denotes the consciousness of new power; toys of childhood\r\nare laid away; womanly thoughts and pursuits fill her mind; budding\r\nchildhood has become blooming womanhood. Now, if ever, must be laid\r\nthe foundation of physical vigor and of a healthy body. Girls should\r\nrealize the significance of this fact. Do not get the idea that men\r\nadmire a weakly, puny, delicate, small-waisted, languid, doll-like\r\ncreature, a libel on true womanhood. Girls admire men with broad\r\nchests, square shoulders, erect form, keen bright eyes, hard muscles\r\nand undoubted vigor. Men also turn naturally to healthy, robust,\r\nwell-developed girls, and to win their admiration girls must meet\r\ntheir ideals. A good form, a sound mind and a healthy body are within\r\nthe reach of nine out of ten of our girls by proper care and training.\r\nPhysical bankruptcy may claim the same proportion if care and training\r\nare neglected.\r\n\r\n26. \"A WOMAN FIVE FEET TALL should measure two feet around the waist\r\nand thirty-three inches around the hips. A waist less than this\r\nproportion indicates compression either by lacing or tight clothing.\r\nExercise in the open air, take long walks and vigorous exercise, using\r\ncare not to overdo it. Housework will prove a panacea for many of the\r\nills which flesh is heir to. One hour's exercise at the wash-tub is of\r\nfar more value, from a physical standpoint, than hours at the piano.\r\nBoating is most excellent exercise and within the reach of many. Care\r\nin dressing is also important, and, fortunately, fashion is coming to\r\nthe rescue here. It is essential that no garments be suspended from\r\nthe waist. Let the shoulders bear the weight of all the clothing, so\r\nthat the organs of the body may be left free and unimpeded.\r\n\r\n27. \"SLEEP SHOULD BE HAD regularly and abundantly. Avoid late hours,\r\nundue excitement, evil associations; partake of plain, nutritious\r\nfood, and health will be your reward. There is one way of destroying\r\nhealth, which, fortunately, is not as common among girls as boys,\r\nand which must be mentioned ere this chapter closes. Self-abuse is\r\npractised among growing girls to such an extent as to arouse serious\r\nalarm. Many a girl has been led to handle and play with her sexual\r\norgans through the advice of some girl who has obtained temporary\r\npleasure in that way; or, perchance, chafing has been followed by\r\nrubbing until the organs have become congested with blood, and in this\r\naccidental manner the girl discovered what seems to her a source of\r\npleasure, but which, alas, is a source of misery, and even death.\r\n\r\n28. \"AS IN THE BOY, SO IN THE GIRL, self-abuse causes an undue amount\r\nof blood to flow to those organs, thus depriving other parts of the\r\nbody of its nourishment, the weakest part first showing the effect of\r\nwant of sustenance. All that has been said upon this loathsome subject\r\nin the preceding chapter for boys might well be repeated here, but\r\nspace forbids. Read that chapter again, and know that the same signs\r\nthat betray the boy will make known the girl addicted to the vice.\r\nThe bloodless lips, the dull, heavy eye surrounded with dark rings,\r\nthe nerveless hand, the blanched cheek, the short breath, the old,\r\nfaded look, the weakened memory and silly irritability tell the story\r\nall too plainly. The same evil result follows, ending perhaps in\r\ndeath, or worse, in insanity. Aside from the injury the girl does\r\nherself by yielding to this habit, there is one other reason which\r\nappeals to the conscience, and that is, self-abuse is an offence\r\nagainst moral law it is putting to a vile, selfish use the organs\r\nwhich were given for a high, sacred purpose.\r\n\r\n29. \"LET THEM ALONE, except to care for them when care is needed, and\r\nthey may prove the greatest blessing you have ever known. They were\r\ngiven you that you might become a mother, the highest office to which\r\nGod has ever called one of His creatures. Do not debase yourself and\r\nbecome lower than the beasts of the field. If this habit has fastened\r\nitself upon any one of our readers, stop it now. Do not allow\r\nyourself to think about it, give up all evil associations, seek pure\r\ncompanions, and go to your mother, older sister, or physician for\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\n30. \"AND YOU, MOTHER, knowing the danger that besets your daughters at\r\nthis critical period, are you justified in keeping silent? Can you be\r\nheld guiltless if your daughter ruins body and mind because you were\r\ntoo modest to tell her the laws of her being? There is no love that is\r\ndearer to your daughter than yours, no advice that is more respected\r\nthan yours, no one whose warning would be more potent. Fail not in\r\nyour duty. As motherhood has been your sweetest joy, so help your\r\ndaughter to make it hers.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YOUNG GARFIELD DRIVING TEAM ON THE CANAL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSAVE THE BOYS.\r\n\r\nPLAIN WORDS TO PARENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. With a shy look, approaching his mother when she was alone, the boy\r\nof fifteen said, \"There are some things I want to ask you. I hear the\r\nboys speak of them at school, and I don't understand, and a fellow\r\ndoesn't like to ask any one but his mother.\"\r\n\r\n2. Drawing him down to her, in the darkness that was closing about\r\nthem, the mother spoke to her son and the son to his mother freely\r\nof things which everybody must know sooner or later, and which no boy\r\nshould learn from \"anyone but his mother\" or father.\r\n\r\n3. If you do not answer such a natural question your boy will turn\r\nfor answer to others, and learn things, perhaps, which your cheeks may\r\nwell blush to have him know.\r\n\r\n4. Our boys and girls are growing faster than we think. The world\r\nmoves; we can no longer put off our children with the old nurses'\r\ntales; even MacDonald's beautiful statement,\r\n\r\n  \"Out of the everywhere into the there\",\r\n\r\ndoes not satisfy them when they reverse his question and ask, \"Where\r\ndid I come from?\"\r\n\r\n5. They must be answered. If we put them off, they may be tempted to\r\ngo elsewhere for information, and hear half-truths, or whole truths\r\nso distorted, so mingled with what is low and impure that, struggle\r\nagainst it as they may in later years, their minds will always retain\r\nthese early impressions.\r\n\r\n6. It is not so hard if you begin early. The very flowers are object\r\nlessons. The wonderful mystery of life is wrapped in one flower, with\r\nits stamens, pistils and ovaries. Every child knows how an egg came\r\nin the nest, and takes it as a matter of course; why not go one step\r\nfarther with them and teach the wonder, the beauty, the holiness that\r\nsurrounds maternity anywhere? Why, centuries ago the Romans honored,\r\nand taught their boys to honor, the women in whose safety was bound up\r\nthe future of their existence as a nation! Why should we do less?\r\n\r\n7. Your sons and mine, your daughters and mine, need to be wisely\r\ntaught and guarded just along these lines, if your sons and mine, your\r\ndaughters and mine, are to grow up into a pure, healthy, Christian\r\nmanhood and womanhood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n8.[_Footnote: This quotation is an appeal to mothers by Mrs. P.B.\r\nSaur, M.D._] \"How grand is the boy who has kept himself undefiled! His\r\ncomplexion clear, his muscles firm, his movements vigorous, his manner\r\nfrank, his courage undaunted, his brain active, his will firm, his\r\nself-control perfect, his body and mind unfolding day by day. His life\r\nshould be one song of praise and thanksgiving. If you want your boy to\r\nbe such a one, train him, my dear woman, _to-day_, and his _to-morrow_\r\nwill take care of itself.\r\n\r\n9. \"Think you that good seed sown will bring forth bitter fruit? A\r\nthousand times, No! As we sow, so shall we reap. Train your boys in\r\nmorality, temperance and virtue. Teach them to embrace good and shun\r\nevil. Teach them the true from the false; the light from the dark.\r\nTeach them that when they take a thing that is not their own, they\r\ncommit a sin. Teach them that _sin means disobedience of God's laws of\r\nevery kind_.\r\n\r\n10. \"God made every organ of our body with the intention that it\r\nshould perform a certain work. If we wish to see, we use our eyes; if\r\nwe want to hear, our ears are called into use. In fact, nature teaches\r\nus the proper use of _all our organs_. I say to you, mother, and oh,\r\nso earnestly: 'Go teach your boy that which you may never be ashamed\r\nto do, about these organs that make him _specially a boy_.'\r\n\r\n11. \"Teach him they are called _sexual organs_; that they are not\r\nimpure, but of special importance, and made by God for a definite\r\npurpose. Teach him that there are impurities taken from the system in\r\nfluid form called urine, and that it passes through the sexual organs,\r\nbut that nature takes care of that. Teach him that these organs are\r\ngiven as a sacred trust, that in maturer years he may be the means of\r\ngiving life to those who shall live forever.\r\n\r\n12. \"Impress upon him that if these organs are abused, or if they are\r\nput to any use besides that for which God made them and He did not\r\nintend they should be used at all until man is fully grown they will\r\nbring disease and ruin upon those who abuse and disobey the laws which\r\nGod has made to govern them. If he has ever learned to handle his\r\n_sexual organs_, or to touch them in any way except to keep them\r\nclean, not to do it again. If he does he will not grow up happy,\r\nhealthy and strong.\r\n\r\n13. \"Teach him that when he handles or excites the sexual organs all\r\nparts of the body suffer, because they are connected by nerves that\r\nrun throughout the system; this is why it is called 'self-abuse.' The\r\nwhole body is abused when this part of the body is handled or excited\r\nin any manner whatever. Teach them to shun all children who indulge in\r\nthis loathsome habit, or all children who talk about these things. The\r\nsin is terrible, and is, in fact, worse than lying or stealing. For,\r\nalthough these are wicked and will ruin their souls, yet this habit of\r\nself-abuse will ruin both soul and body.\r\n\r\n14. \"If the sexual organs are handled, it brings too much blood to\r\nthese parts, and this produces a diseased condition; it also causes\r\ndisease in other organs of the body, because they are left with a less\r\namount of blood than they ought to have. The sexual organs, too, are\r\nvery closely connected with the spine and the brain by means of the\r\nnerves, and if they are handled, or if you keep thinking about them,\r\nthese nerves get excited and become exhausted, and this makes the back\r\nache, the brain heavy and the whole body weak.\r\n\r\n15. \"It lays the foundation for consumption, paralysis and heart\r\ndisease. It weakens the memory, makes a boy careless, negligent and\r\nlistless. It even makes many lose their minds; others, when grown,\r\ncommit suicide. How often mothers see their little boys handling\r\nthemselves, and let it pass, because they think the boy will outgrow\r\nthe habit, and do not realize the strong hold it has upon them. I say\r\nto you who love your boys 'Watch!'\r\n\r\n16. \"Don't think it does no harm to your boy because he does not\r\nsuffer now, for the effects of this vice come on so slowly that the\r\nvictim is often very near death before you realize that he has done\r\nhimself harm. The boy with no knowledge of the consequences, and with\r\nno one to warn him, finds momentary pleasure in its practice, and\r\nso contracts a habit which grows upon him, undermining his health,\r\npoisoning his mind, arresting his development, and laying the\r\nfoundation for future misery.\r\n\r\n17. \"Do not read this book and forget it, for it contains earnest and\r\nliving truths. Do not let false modesty stand in your way, but from\r\nthis time on keep this thought in mind 'the saving of your boy.'\r\nFollow its teachings and you will bless God as long as you live. Read\r\nit to your neighbors, who, like yourself, have growing boys, and urge\r\nthem for the sake of humanity to heed its advice.\r\n\r\n18. \"Right here we want to emphasize the importance of _cleanliness_.\r\nWe verily believe that oftentimes these habits originate in a burning\r\nand irritating sensation about the organs, caused by a want of\r\nthorough washing.\r\n\r\n19. \"It is worthy of note that many eminent physicians now advocate\r\nthe custom of circumcision, claiming that the removal of a little of\r\nthe foreskin induces cleanliness, thus preventing the irritation and\r\nexcitement which come from the gathering of the whiteish matter under\r\nthe foreskin at the beginning of the glands. This irritation being\r\nremoved, the boy is less apt to tamper with his sexual organs. The\r\nargument seems a good one, especially when we call to mind the high\r\nphysical state of those people who have practiced the custom.\r\n\r\n20. \"Happy is the mother who can feel she has done her duty, in this\r\ndirection, while her boy is still a child. For those mothers, though,\r\nwhose little boys have now grown to boyhood with the evil still upon\r\nthem, and _you_, through ignorance, permitted it, we would say, 'Begin\r\nat once; it is never too late.' If he has not lost all will power, he\r\ncan be saved. Let him go in confidence to a reputable physician and\r\nfollow his advice. Simple diet, plentiful exercise in open air and\r\ncongenial employment will do much. Do not let the mind dwell upon\r\nevil thoughts, shun evil companions, avoid vulgar stories, sensational\r\nnovels, and keep the thoughts pure.\r\n\r\n21. \"Let him interest himself in social and benevolent affairs,\r\nparticipate in Sunday-school work, farmers' clubs, or any\r\norganizations which tend to elevate and inspire noble sentiment. Let\r\nus remember that 'a perfect man is the noblest work of God.' God has\r\ngiven us a life which is to last forever, and the little time we spend\r\non earth is as nothing to the ages which we are to spend in the world\r\nbeyond; so our earthly life is a very important part of our existence,\r\nfor it is here that the foundation is laid for either happiness or\r\nmisery in the future. It is here that we decide our destiny, and our\r\nefforts to know and obey God's laws in our bodies as well as in\r\nour souls will not only bring blessings to us in this life, but\r\nnever-ending happiness throughout eternity.\"\r\n\r\n22. A QUESTION. How can a father chew and smoke tobacco, drink and\r\nswear, use vulgar language, tell obscene stories, and raise a family\r\nof pure, clean-minded children? LET THE ECHO ANSWER.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN, AND FORBID THEM NOT, TO COME\r\nUNTO ME: FOR OF SUCH IS THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN-\"--_MATT. 19:14_]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE INHUMANITIES OF PARENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Not long ago a Presbyterian minister in Western New York whipped\r\nhis three-year-old boy to death for refusing to say his prayers. The\r\nlittle fingers were broken; the tender flesh was bruised and actually\r\nmangled; strong men wept when they looked on the lifeless body. Think\r\nof a strong man from one hundred and fifty to two hundred pounds in\r\nweight, pouncing upon a little child, like a Tiger upon a Lamb, and\r\nwith his strong arm inflicting physical blows on the delicate tissues\r\nof a child's body. See its frail and trembling flesh quiver and its\r\ntender nervous organization shaking with terror and fear.\r\n\r\n2. How often is this the case in the punishment of children all over\r\nthis broad land! Death is not often the immediate consequence of this\r\nbrutality as in the above stated case, but the punishment is often as\r\nunjust, and the physical constitution of children is often ruined and\r\nthe mind by fright seriously injured.\r\n\r\n3. Everyone knows the sudden sense of pain, and sometimes dizziness\r\nand nausea follow, as the results of an accidental hitting of the\r\nankle, knee or elbow against a hard substance, and involuntary tears\r\nare brought to the eyes; but what is such a pain as this compared\r\nwith the pains of a dozen or more quick blows on the body of a little\r\nhelpless child from the strong arm of a parent in a passion? Add\r\nto this overwhelming terror of fright, the strangulating effects\r\nof sighing and shrieking, and you have a complete picture of\r\nchild-torture.\r\n\r\n4. Who has not often seen a child receive, within an hour or two of\r\nthe first whipping, a second one, for some small ebullition of nervous\r\nirritability, which was simply inevitable from its spent and worn\r\ncondition?\r\n\r\n5. Would not all mankind cry out at the inhumanity of one who, as\r\nthings are to-day, should propose the substitution of pricking or\r\ncutting or burning for whipping? It would, however, be easy to show\r\nthat small jabs or pricks or cuts are more human than the blows\r\nmany children receive. Why may not lying be as legitimately cured by\r\nblisters made with hot coals as by black and blue spots made with\r\na ruler or whip? The principle is the same; and if the principle is\r\nright, why not multiply methods?\r\n\r\n6. How many loving mothers will, without any thought of cruelty,\r\ninflict half a dozen quick blows on the little hand of her child and\r\nwhen she could no more take a pin and make the same number of thrusts\r\ninto the tender flesh, than she could bind the baby on a rack. Yet\r\nthe pin-thrust would hurt far less, and would probably make a deeper\r\nimpression on the child's mind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n7. We do not intend to be understood that a child must have everything\r\nthat it desires and every whim and wish to receive special recognition\r\nby the parents. Children can soon be made to understand the necessity\r\nof obedience, and punishment can easily be brought about by teaching\r\nthem self-denial. Deny them the use of a certain plaything, deny them\r\nthe privilege of visiting certain of their little friends, deny\r\nthem the privilege of the table, etc., and these self-denials can be\r\napplied according to the age and condition of the child, with firmness\r\nand without any yielding. Children will soon learn obedience if they\r\nsee the parents are sincere. Lessons of home government can be learned\r\nby the children at home as well as they can learn lessons at school.\r\n\r\n8. The trouble is, many parents need more government, more training\r\nand more discipline than the little ones under their control.\r\n\r\n9. Scores of times during the day a child is told in a short,\r\nauthoritative way to do or not to do certain little things, which we\r\nask at the hands of elder persons as favors. When we speak to an elder\r\nperson, we say, would you be so kind as to close the door, when the\r\nsame person making the request of a child will say, _\"Shut the door.\"_\r\n_\"Bring me the chair.\"_ _\"Stop that noise.\"_ _\"Sit down there.\"_\r\nWhereas, if the same kindness was used towards the child it would soon\r\nlearn to imitate the example.\r\n\r\n10. On the other hand, let a child ask for anything without saying\r\n\"please,\" receive anything without saying \"thank you,\" it suffers a\r\nrebuke and a look of scorn at once. Often a child insists on having a\r\nbook, chair or apple to the inconveniencing of an elder, and what an\r\noutcry is raised: \"Such rudeness;\" \"Such an ill-mannered child;\" \"His\r\nparents must have neglected him strangely.\" Not at all: The parents\r\nmay have been steadily telling him a great many times every day not\r\nto do these precise things which you dislike. But they themselves have\r\nbeen all the time doing those very things before him, and there is no\r\nproverb that strikes a truer balance between two things than the old\r\none which weighs example over against precept.\r\n\r\n11. It is a bad policy to be rude to children. A child will win and be\r\nwon, and in a long run the chances are that the child will have better\r\nmanners than its parents. Give them a good example and take pains in\r\nteaching them lessons of obedience and propriety, and there will be\r\nlittle difficulty in raising a family of beautiful and well-behaved\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n12. Never correct a child in the presence of others; it is a rudeness\r\nto the child that will soon destroy its self-respect. It is the way\r\ncriminals are made and should always and everywhere be condemned.\r\n\r\n13. But there are no words to say what we are or what we deserve if we\r\ndo this to the little children whom we have dared for our own pleasure\r\nto bring into the perils of this life, and whose whole future may be\r\nblighted by the mistakes of our careless hands. There are thousands of\r\nyoung men and women to-day groaning under the penalties and burdens\r\nof life, who owe their misfortunes, their shipwreck and ruin to the\r\nignorance or indifference of parents.\r\n\r\n14. Parents of course love their children, but with that love there is\r\na responsibility that cannot be shirked. The government and training\r\nof children is a study that demands a parent's time and attention\r\noften much more than the claims of business.\r\n\r\n15. Parents, study the problems that come up every day in your home.\r\nRemember, your future happiness, and the future welfare of your\r\nchildren, depend upon it.\r\n\r\n16. CRIMINALS AND HEREDITY. Wm. M.F. Round was for many years in\r\ncharge of the House of Refuge on Randall's Island, New York, and his\r\nopportunities for observation in the work among criminals surely\r\nmake him a competent judge, and he says in his letter to the New York\r\nObserver: \"Among this large number of young offenders I can state\r\nwith entire confidence that not one per cent. were children born of\r\ncriminal parents; and with equal confidence I am able to say that the\r\ncommon cause of their delinquency was found in bad parental training,\r\nin bad companionship, and in lack of wholesome restraint from evil\r\nassociations and influences. It was this knowledge that led to the\r\nestablishing of the House of Refuge nearly three-quarters of a century\r\nago.\"\r\n\r\n17. BAD TRAINING. Thus it is seen from one of the best authorities in\r\nthe United States that criminals are made either by the indifference\r\nor the neglect of parents, or both, or by too much training without\r\nproper judgment and knowledge. Give your children a good example, and\r\nnever tell a child to do something and then become indifferent as to\r\nwhether they do it or not. A child should never be told twice to do\r\nthe same thing. Teach the child in childhood obedience and never vary\r\nfrom that rule. Do it kindly but firmly.\r\n\r\n18. IF YOUR CHILDREN DO NOT OBEY OR RESPECT YOU in their childhood and\r\nyouth, how can you expect to govern them when older and shape their\r\ncharacter for future usefulness and good citizenship?\r\n\r\n19. THE FUNDAMENTAL RULE. Never tell a child twice to do the same\r\nthing. Command the respect of your children, and there will be no\r\nquestion as to obedience.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHASTITY AND PURITY OF CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n1. CHASTITY is the purest and brightest jewel in human character. Dr.\r\nPierce in his widely known _Medical Adviser_ says: For the full and\r\nperfect development of mankind, both mental and physical, chastity is\r\nnecessary. The health demands abstinence from unlawful intercourse.\r\nTherefore children should be instructed to avoid all impure works of\r\nfiction, which tend to inflame the mind and excite the passions. Only\r\nin total abstinence from illicit pleasures is there safety, morals,\r\nand health, while integrity, peace and happiness are the conscious\r\nrewards of virtue. Impurity travels downward with intemperance,\r\nobscenity and corrupting diseases, to degradation and death. A\r\ndissolute, licentious, free-and-easy life is filled with the dregs of\r\nhuman suffering, iniquity and despair. The penalties which follow a\r\nviolation of the law of chastity are found to be severe and swiftly\r\nretributive.\r\n\r\n2. THE UNION of the sexes in holy Matrimony is a law of nature,\r\nfinding sanction in both morals and legislation. Even some of the\r\nlower animals unite in this union for life and instinctively observe\r\nthe law of conjugal fidelity with a consistency which might put to\r\nblush other animals more highly endowed. It seems important to discuss\r\nthis subject and understand our social evils, as well as the intense\r\npassional desires of the sexes, which must be controlled, or they lead\r\nto ruin.\r\n\r\n3. SEXUAL PROPENSITIES are possessed by all, and these must be held in\r\nabeyance, until they are needed for legitimate purposes. Hence parents\r\nought to understand the value to their children of mental and physical\r\nlabor, to elevate and strengthen the intellectual and moral faculties,\r\nto develop the muscular system and direct the energies of the\r\nblood into healthful channels. Vigorous employment of mind and body\r\nengrosses the vital energies and diverts them from undue excitement of\r\nthe sexual desires.\r\n\r\n  _Give your young people plenty of outdoor amusement; less of\r\n  dancing and more of croquet and lawn tennis. Stimulate the methods\r\n  of pure thoughts in innocent amusement, and your sons and daughters\r\n  will mature to manhood and womanhood pure and chaste in character._\r\n\r\n4. IGNORANCE DOES NOT MEAN INNOCENCE.--It is a current idea,\r\nespecially among our good common people, that the child should be\r\nkept in ignorance regarding the mystery of his own body and how he was\r\ncreated or came into the world. This is a great mistake. Parents must\r\nknow that the sources of social impurity are great, and the child is a\r\nhundred times more liable to have his young mind poisoned if\r\nentirely ignorant of the functions of his nature than if judiciously\r\nenlightened on these important truths by the parent. The parent must\r\ngive him weapons of defense against the putrid corruption he is sure\r\nto meet outside the parental roof. The child cannot get through the A,\r\nB, C period of school without it.\r\n\r\n5. CONFLICTING VIEWS.--There is a great difference of opinion regarding\r\nthe age at which the child should be taught the mysteries of nature:\r\nsome maintain that he cannot comprehend the subject before the age of\r\npuberty; others say \"they will find it out soon enough, it is not best\r\nto have them over-wise while they are so young. Wait a while.\" That is\r\njust the point (_they will find it out_), and we ask in all candor,\r\nis it not better that they learn it from the pure loving mother,\r\nuntarnished from any insinuating remark, than that they should learn\r\nit from some foul-mouthed libertine on the street, or some giddy girl\r\nat school? Mothers! fathers! which think you is the most sensible and\r\nfraught with the least danger to your darling boy or girl?\r\n\r\n6. DELAY IS FRAUGHT WITH DANGER.--Knowledge on a subject so vitally\r\nconnected with moral health must not be deferred. It is safe to say\r\nthat no child, no boy at least in these days of excitement and unrest,\r\nreaches the age of ten years without getting some idea of nature's\r\nlaws regarding parenthood. And ninety-nine chances to one, those ideas\r\nwill be vile and pernicious unless they come from a wise, loving and\r\npure parent. Now, we entreat you, parents, mothers! do not wait; begin\r\nbefore a false notion has had chance to find lodgment in the childish\r\nmind. But remember this is a lesson of life, it cannot be told in one\r\nchapter, it is as important as the lessons of love and duty.\r\n\r\n7. THE FIRST LESSONS.--Should you be asked by your four or five-year\r\nold, \"Mamma, where did you get me?\" Instead of saying, \"The doctor\r\nbrought you,\" or \"God made you and a stork brought you from Babyland\r\non his back,\" tell him the truth as you would about any ordinary\r\nquestion. One mother's explanation was something like this: \"My\r\ndear, you were not made any more than apples are made, or the little\r\nchickens are made. Your dolly was made, but it has no life like you\r\nhave. God has provided that all living things such as plants, trees,\r\nlittle chickens, little kittens, little babies, etc., should grow from\r\nseeds or little tiny eggs. Apples grow, little chickens grow, little\r\nbabies grow. Apple and peach trees grow from seeds that are planted\r\nin the ground, and the apples and peaches grow on the trees. Baby\r\nchickens grow inside the eggs that are kept warm by the mother hen\r\nfor a certain time. Baby boys and girls do not grow inside an egg, but\r\nthey start to grow inside of a snug warm nest, from an egg that is\r\nso small you cannot see it with just your eye.\" This was not given at\r\nonce, but from time to time as the child asked questions and in the\r\nsimplest language, with many illustrations from plant and animal\r\nlife. It may have occupied months, but in time the lesson was fully\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n8. THE SECOND LESSON.--The second lesson came with the question, \"But\r\n_where_ is the nest?\" The ice is now broken, as it were; it was an\r\neasy matter for the mother to say, \"The nest in which you grew, dear,\r\nwas close to your mother's heart inside her body. All things that\r\ndo not grow inside the egg itself, and which are kept warm by the\r\nmother's body, begin to grow from the egg in a nest inside the\r\nmother's body.\" It may be that this mother had access to illustrations\r\nof the babe in the womb which were shown and explained to the child,\r\na boy. He was pleased and satisfied with the explanations. It meant\r\nnothing out of the ordinary any more than a primary lesson on the\r\ncirculatory system did, it was knowledge on nature in its purity and\r\nsimplicity taught by mother, and hence caused no surprise. The subject\r\nof the male and female generative organs came later; the greatest\r\npains and care was taken to make it clear, the little boy was taught\r\nthat the _sexual organs_ were made for a high and holy purpose, that\r\ntheir office at present is only to carry off impurities from the\r\nsystem in the fluid form called urine, and that he must never handle\r\nhis _sexual organs_ nor touch them in any way except to keep them\r\nclean, and if he does this, he will grow up a bright, happy and\r\nhealthy boy. But if he excites or _abuses_ them, he will become\r\npuny, sickly and unhappy. All this was explained in language pure and\r\nsimple. There is now in the boy a sturdy base of character building\r\nalong the line of virtue and purity through knowledge.\r\n\r\n9. SILLY DIRTY TRASH.--But I hear some mother say \"Such silly dirty\r\ntrash to tell a child!\" It is not dirty nor silly; it is nature's\r\nuntarnished truth. God has ordained that children should thus be\r\nbrought into the world, do you call the works of God silly? Remember,\r\nkind mother, and don't forget it, if you fail to teach your children,\r\nboys or girls, these important lessons early in life, they will\r\nlearn them from other sources, perhaps long ere you dream of it,\r\nand ninety-nine times out of one hundred they will get improper,\r\nperverted, impure and vile ideas of these important truths; besides\r\nyou nave lost their confidence and you will never regain it in these\r\nmatters. They will never come to mamma for information on these\r\nsubjects. And, think you, that your son and daughter, later in life\r\nwill make you their confidant as they ought? Will your beautiful\r\ndaughter hand the first letters she receives from her lover to mamma\r\nto read, and seek her counsel and advice when she replies to them?\r\nWill she ask mamma whether it is ever proper to sit in her lover's\r\nlap? I think not; you have blighted her confidence and alienated her\r\naffections. You have kept knowledge from her that she had a right\r\nto know; you even failed to teach her the important truths of\r\nmenstruation. Troubled and excited at the first menstrual flow, she\r\ndashed her feet in cold water hoping to stop the flow. You know the\r\nresults she is now twenty-five but is suffering from it to this day.\r\nYou, her mother, over fastidious, _so very nice_ you would never\r\nmention \"_such silly trash_\" but by your consummate foolishness and\r\nmock modesty you have ruined your daughter's health, and though in\r\nlater years she may forgive you, yet she can never love and respect\r\nyou as she ought.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. \"KNOWLEDGE THE PRESERVER OF PURITY.\"--Laura E. Scammon, writing on\r\nthis subject, in the Arena of November, 1893, says: \"When questions\r\narise that can not be answered by observation, reply to each as simply\r\nand directly as you answer questions upon other subjects, giving\r\nscientific names and facts, and such explanations as are suited to\r\nthe comprehension of the child. Treat nature and her laws always with\r\nserious, respectful attention. Treat the holy mysteries of parenthood\r\nreverently, never losing sight of the great law upon which are founded\r\nall others the law of love. Say it and sing it, play it and pray it\r\ninto the soul of your child, that _love is lord of all_.\"\r\n\r\n11. CONCLUSION OF THE WHOLE MATTER.--Observation and common sense\r\nshould teach every parent that lack of knowledge on these subjects and\r\nproper counsel and advice in later years is the main cause of so\r\nmany charming girls being seduced and led astray, and so many bright\r\npromising boys wrecked by _self-abuse or social impurity_. Make your\r\nchildren your confidants early in life, especially in these things,\r\nhave frequent talks with them on nature, and you will never, other\r\nthings being equal, mourn over a ruined daughter or a wreckless,\r\ndebased son.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEXCITING THE PASSIONS IN CHILDREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. CONVERSATION BEFORE CHILDREN.--The conduct and conversation of\r\nadults before children and youth, how often have I blushed with shame,\r\nand kindled with indignation at the conversation of parents, and\r\nespecially of mothers, to their children: \"John, go and kiss Harriet,\r\nfor she is your sweet-heart.\" Well may shame make him hesitate and\r\nhang his head. \"Why, John, I did not think you so great a coward.\r\nAfraid of the girls, are you? That will never do. Come, go along, and\r\nhug and kiss her. There, that's a man. I guess you will love the girls\r\nyet.\" Continually is he teased about the girls and being in love, till\r\nhe really selects a sweet-heart.\r\n\r\n2. THE LOSS OF MAIDEN PURITY AND NATURAL DELICACY.--I will not lift\r\nthe veil, nor expose the conduct of children among themselves. And\r\nall this because adults have filled their heads with those impurities\r\nwhich surfeit their own. What could more effectually wear off that\r\nnatural delicacy, that maiden purity and bashfulness, which form the\r\nmain barriers against the influx of vitiated Amativeness? How often do\r\nthose whose modesty has been worn smooth, even take pleasure in thus\r\nsaying and doing things to raise the blush on the cheek of youth and\r\ninnocence, merely to witness the effect of this improper illusion\r\nupon them; little realizing that they are thereby breaking down the\r\nbarriers of their virtue, and prematurely kindling the fires of animal\r\npassion!\r\n\r\n3. BALLS. PARTIES AND AMUSEMENTS.--The entire machinery of balls\r\nand parties, of dances and other amusements of young people, tend to\r\nexcite and inflame this passion. Thinking it a fine thing to get in\r\nlove, they court and form attachments long before either their mental\r\nor physical powers are matured. Of course, these young loves, these\r\ngreen-house exotics, must be broken off, and their miserable subjects\r\nleft burning up with the fierce fires of a flaming passion, which, if\r\nleft alone, would have slumbered on for years, till they were prepared\r\nfor its proper management and exercise.\r\n\r\n4. SOWING THE SEEDS FOR FUTURE RUIN.--Nor is it merely the\r\nconversation of adults that does all this mischief; their manners also\r\nincrease it. Young men take the hands of girls from six to thirteen\r\nyears old, kiss them, press them, and play with them so as, in a great\r\nvariety of ways, to excite their innocent passions, combined, I grant,\r\nwith friendship and refinement--for all this is genteely done. They\r\nintend no harm, and parents dream of none: and yet their embryo love\r\nis awakened, to be again still more easily excited. Maiden ladies, and\r\neven married women, often express similar feelings towards lads, not\r\nperhaps positively improper in themselves, yet injurious in their\r\nultimate effects.\r\n\r\n5. READING NOVELS.--How often have I seen girls not twelve years old,\r\nas hungry for a story or novel as they should be for their dinners! A\r\nsickly sentimentalism is thus formed, and their minds are sullied with\r\nimpure desires. Every fashionable young lady must of course read every\r\nnew novel, though nearly all of them contain exceptionable allusions,\r\nperhaps delicately covered over with a thin gauze of fashionable\r\nrefinement; yet, on that very account, the more objectionable. If\r\nthis work contained one improper allusion to their ten, many of those\r\nfastidious ladies who now eagerly devour the vulgarities of Dumas, and\r\nthe double-entendres of Bulwer, and even converse with gentlemen about\r\ntheir contents, would discountenance or condemn it as improper. _Shame\r\non novel-reading women_; for they cannot have pure minds or unsullied\r\nfeelings, but Cupid and the beaux, and waking of dreams of love, are\r\nfast consuming their health and virtue.\r\n\r\n6. THEATER-GOING.--Theaters and theatrical dancing, also inflame\r\nthe passions, and are \"the wide gate\" of \"the broad road\" of moral\r\nimpurity. Fashionable music is another, especially the verses set to\r\nit, being mostly love-sick ditties, or sentimental odes, breathing\r\nthis tender passion in its most melting and bewitching strains.\r\nImproper prints often do immense injury in this respect, as do also\r\nballs, parties, annuals, newspaper articles, exceptional works, etc.\r\n\r\n7. THE CONCLUSION OF THE WHOLE MATTER.--Stop for one moment and think\r\nfor yourself and you will be convinced that the sentiment herein\r\nannounced is for your good and the benefit of all mankind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPUBERTY, VIRILITY AND HYGIENIC LAWS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. WHAT IS PUBERTY?--The definition is explained in another portion\r\nof this book, but it should be understood that it is not a prompt or\r\nimmediate change; it is a slow extending growth and may extend for\r\nmany years. The ripening of physical powers do not take place when the\r\nfirst signs of puberty appear.\r\n\r\n2. PROPER AGE.--The proper age for puberty should vary from twelve to\r\neighteen years. As a general rule, in the more vigorous and the more\r\naddicted to athletic exercise or out-door life, this change is slower\r\nin making its approach.\r\n\r\n3. HYGIENIC ATTENTION.--Youths at this period should receive special\r\nprivate attention. They should be taught the purpose of the sexual\r\norgans and the proper hygienic laws that govern them, and they should\r\nalso be taught to rise in the morning and not to lie in bed after\r\nwaking up, because it is largely owing to this habit that the secret\r\nvice is contracted. One of the common causes of premature excitement\r\nin many boys is a tight foreskin. It may cause much evil and\r\nought always to be remedied. Ill-fitting garments often cause much\r\nirritation in children and produce unnatural passions. It is best to\r\nhave boys sleep in separate beds and not have them sleep together if\r\nit can be avoided.\r\n\r\n4. PROPER INFLUENCE.--Every boy and girl should be carefully trained\r\nto look with disgust on everything that is indecent in word or action.\r\nLet them be taught a sense of shame in doing shameful things, and\r\nteach them that modesty is honorable, and that immodesty is indecent\r\nand dishonorable. Careful training at the proper age may save many a\r\nboy or girl from ruin.\r\n\r\n5. SEXUAL PASSIONS.--The sexual passions may be a fire from heaven, or\r\na subtle flame from hell. It depends upon the government and proper\r\ncontrol. The noblest and most unselfish emotions take their arise\r\nin the passion of sex. Its sweet influence, its elevating ties,\r\nits vibrations and harmony, all combine to make up the noble and\r\ncourageous traits of man.\r\n\r\n6. WHEN PASSIONS BEGIN.--It is thought by some that passions begin at\r\nthe age of puberty, but the passions may be produced as early as\r\nfive or ten years. All depends upon the training or the want of it.\r\nSelf-abuse is not an uncommon evil at the age of eight or ten. A\r\ncompany of bad boys often teach an innocent child that which will\r\ndevelop his ruin. A boy may feel a sense of pleasure at eight and\r\nproduce a slight discharge, but not of semen. Thus it is seen that\r\nparents may by neglect do their child the greatest injury.\r\n\r\n7. FALSE MODESTY.--Let there be no false modesty on part of the\r\nparents. Give the child the necessary advice and instructions as soon\r\nas necessary.\r\n\r\n8. THE MAN UNSEXED, by Mutilation or Masturbation. Eunuchs\r\nare proverbial for tenor cruelty and crafty and unsympathizing\r\ndispositions. Their mental powers are feeble and their physical\r\nstrength is inferior. They lack courage and physical endurance. When\r\na child is operated upon before the age of puberty, the voice retains\r\nits childish treble, the limbs their soft and rounded outlines, and\r\nthe neck acquires a feminine fulness; no beard makes its appearance.\r\nIn ancient times and up to this time in Oriental nations eunuchs are\r\nfound. They are generally slaves who have suffered mutilation at a\r\ntender age. It is a scientific fact that where boys have been taught\r\nthe practice of masturbation in their early years, say from eight to\r\nfourteen years of age, if they survive at all they often have their\r\npowers reduced to a similar condition of a eunuch. They generally\r\nhowever suffer a greater disadvantage. Their health will be more or\r\nless injured. In the eunuch the power of sexual intercourse is not\r\nentirely lost, but of course there is sterility, and little if\r\nany satisfaction, and the same thing may be true of the victim of\r\nself-abuse.\r\n\r\n9. SIGNS OF VIRILITY.--As the young man develops in strength and years\r\nthe sexual appetite will manifest itself. The secretion of the male\r\nknown as the seed or semen depends for the life-transmitting power\r\nupon little minute bodies called spermatozoa. These are very active\r\nand numerous in a healthy secretion, being many hundreds in a single\r\ndrop and a single one of them is capable to bring about conception in\r\na female. Dr. Napheys in his \"Transmission of Life,\" says: \"The\r\nsecreted fluid has been frozen and kept at a temperature of zero for\r\nfour days, yet when it was thawed these animalcules, as they are\r\nsupposed to be, were as active as ever. They are not, however, always\r\npresent, and when present may be of variable activity. In young men,\r\njust past puberty, and in aged men, they are often scarce and languid\r\nin motion.\" At the proper age the secretion is supposed to be the most\r\nactive, generally at the age of twenty-five, and decreases as age\r\nincreases.\r\n\r\n10. HYGIENIC RULE.--The man at mid-life should guard carefully his\r\npassions and the husband his virile powers, and as the years progress,\r\nsteadily wean himself more from his desire, for his passions will\r\nbecome weaker with age and any excitement in middle life may soon\r\ndebilitate and destroy his virile powers.\r\n\r\n11. FOLLIES OF YOUTH.--Dr. Napheys says: \"Not many men can fritter away\r\na decade or two of years in dissipation and excess, and ever hope to\r\nmake up their losses by rigid surveillance in later years.\" \"The\r\nsins of youth are expiated in age,\" is a proverb which daily examples\r\nillustrate. In proportion as puberty is precocious, will decadence be\r\npremature; the excesses of middle life draw heavily on the fortune\r\nof later years. \"The mill of the gods grinds slow, but it grinds\r\nexceedingly fine,\" and though nature may be a tardy creditor, she is\r\nfound at last to be an inexorable one.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOUR SECRET SINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. PASSIONS.--Every healthful man has sexual desires and he might as\r\nwell refuse to satisfy his hunger as to deny their existence. The\r\nCreator has given us various appetites intended they should be\r\nindulged, and has provided the means.\r\n\r\n2. REASON.--While it is true that a healthy man has strongly developed\r\nsexual passions, yet, God has crowned man with reason, and with\r\na proper exercise of this wonderful faculty of the human mind no\r\nlascivious thoughts need to control the passions. A pure heart will\r\ndevelop pure thoughts and bring out a good life.\r\n\r\n3. RIOTING IN VISIONS.--Dr. Lewis says: \"Rioting in visions of nude\r\nwomen may exhaust one as much as an excess in actual intercourse.\r\nThere are multitudes who would never spend the night with an abandoned\r\nfemale, but who rarely meet a young girl that their imaginations are\r\nnot busy with her person. This species of indulgence is well-nigh\r\nuniversal; and it is the source of all other forms the fountain from\r\nwhich the external vices spring, and the nursery of masturbation.\"\r\n\r\n4. COMMITTING ADULTERY IN THE HEART.--A young man who allows his mind\r\nto dwell upon the vision of nude women will soon become a victim of\r\nruinous passion, and either fall under the influence of lewd women\r\nor resort to self-abuse. The man who has no control over his mind and\r\nallows impure thoughts to be associated with the name of every female\r\nthat may be suggested to his mind, is but committing adultery in his\r\nheart, just as guilty at heart as though he had committed the deed.\r\n\r\n5. UNCHASTITY.--So far as the record is preserved, unchastity has\r\ncontributed above all other causes, more to the ruin and exhaustion\r\nand demoralization of the race than all other wickedness. And we shall\r\nnot be likely to vanquish the monster, even in ourselves, unless we\r\nmake the thoughts our point of attack. So long as they are sensual we\r\nare indulging in sexual abuse, and are almost sure, when temptation\r\nis presented, to commit the overt acts of sin. If we cannot succeed\r\nwithin, we may pray in vain for help to resist the tempter outwardly.\r\nA young man who will indulge in obscene language will be guilty of a\r\nworse deed if opportunity is offered.\r\n\r\n6. BAD DRESSING.--If women knew how much mischief they do men they\r\nwould change some of their habits of dress. The dress of their busts,\r\nthe padding in different parts, are so contrived as to call away\r\nattention from the soul and fix it on the bosom and hips. And then,\r\nmany, even educated women, are careful to avoid serious subjects in\r\nour presence one minute before a gentleman enters the room they may\r\nbe engaged in thoughtful discussion, but the moment he appears their\r\nwhole style changes; they assume light fascinating ways, laugh sweet\r\nlittle bits of laughs, and turn their heads this way and that, all\r\nwhich forbids serious thinking and gives men over to imagination.\r\n\r\n7. THE LUSTFUL EYE.--How many men there are who lecherously stare at\r\nevery woman in whose presence they happen to be. These monsters stare\r\nat women as though they were naked in a cage on exhibition. A man\r\nwhose whole manner is full of animal passion is not worthy of\r\nthe respect of refined women. They have no thoughts, no ideas, no\r\nsentiments, nothing to interest them but the bodies of women whom\r\nthey behold. The moral character of young women has no significance\r\nor weight in their eyes. This kind of men are a curse to society and a\r\ndanger to the community. No young lady is safe in their company.\r\n\r\n8. REBUKING SENSUALISM.--If the young women would exercise an honorable\r\nindependence and heap contempt upon the young men that allow their\r\nimagination to take such liberties, a different state of things would\r\nsoon follow. Men of that type of character should have no recognition\r\nin the presence of ladies.\r\n\r\n9. EARLY MARRIAGES.--There can be no doubt that early marriages are\r\nbad for both parties. For children of such a marriage always lack\r\nvitality. The ancient Germans did not marry until the twenty-fourth\r\nor twenty-fifth year, previous to which they observed the most rigid\r\nchastity, and in consequence they acquired a size and strength that\r\nexcited the astonishment of Europe. The present incomparable vigor of\r\nthat race, both physically and mentally, is due in a great measure to\r\ntheir long established aversion to marrying young. The results of too\r\nearly marriages are in brief, stunted growth and impaired strength\r\non the part of the male; delicate if not utterly bad health in the\r\nfemale; the premature old age or death of one or both, and a puny,\r\nsickly offspring.\r\n\r\n10. SIGNS OF EXCESSES.--Dr. Dio Lewis says: \"Some of the most common\r\neffects of sexual excess are backache, lassitude, giddiness, dimness\r\nof sight, noises in the ears, numbness of the fingers, and paralysis.\r\nThe drain is universal, but the more sensitive organs and tissues\r\nsuffer most. So the nervous system gives way and continues the\r\nprincipal sufferer throughout. A large part of the premature loss of\r\nsight and hearing, dizziness, numbness and pricking in the hands\r\nand feet, and other kindred developments, are justly chargeable to\r\nunbridled venery. Not unfrequently you see men whose head or back or\r\nnerve testifies of such reckless expenditure.\"\r\n\r\n11. NON-COMPLETED INTERCOURSE.--Withdrawal before the emission occurs\r\nis injurious to both parties. The soiling of the conjugal bed by the\r\nshameful manoeuvres is to be deplored.\r\n\r\n12. THE EXTENT OF THE PRACTICE.--One cannot tell to what extent this\r\nvice is practiced, except by observing its consequences, even among\r\npeople who fear to commit the slightest sin, to such a degree is the\r\npublic conscience perverted upon this point. Still, many husbands know\r\nthat nature often renders nugatory the most subtle calculations, and\r\nreconquers the rights which they have striven to frustrate. No matter;\r\nthey persevere none the less, and by the force of habit they poison\r\nthe most blissful moments of life, with no surety of averting the\r\nresult that they fear. So who knows if the too often feeble and\r\nweakened infants are not the fruit of these in themselves incomplete\r\nprocreations, and disturbed by preoccupations foreign to the natural\r\nact.\r\n\r\n13. HEALTH OF WOMEN.--Furthermore, the moral relations existing between\r\nthe married couple undergo unfortunate changes; this affection,\r\nfounded upon reciprocal esteem, is little by little effaced by the\r\nrepetition of an act which pollutes the marriage bed. If the good\r\nharmony of families and the reciprocal relations are seriously menaced\r\nby the invasion of these detestable practices, the health of women, as\r\nwe have already intimated, is fearfully injured.\r\n\r\n14. CROWNING SIN OF THE AGE.--Then there is the crime of abortion which\r\nis so prevalent in these days. It is the crowning sin of the age,\r\nthough in a broader sense it includes all those sins that are\r\ncommitted to limit the size of the family. \"It lies at the root of our\r\nspiritual life,\" says Rev. B.D. Sinclair, \"and though secret in its\r\nnature, paralyzes Christian life and neutralizes every effort for\r\nrighteousness which the church puts forth.\"\r\n\r\n15. SEXUAL EXHAUSTION.--Every sexual excitement is exhaustive in\r\nproportion to its intensity and continuance. If a man sits by the side\r\nof a woman, fondles and kisses her three or four hours, and allows his\r\nimagination to run riot with sexual visions, he will be five times as\r\nmuch exhausted as he would by the act culminating in emission. It is\r\nthe sexual excitement more than the emission which exhausts. As shown\r\nin another part of this work, thoughts of sexual intimacies, long\r\ncontinued, lead to the worst effects. To a man, whose imagination\r\nis filled with erotic fancies the emission comes as a merciful\r\ninterruption to the burning, harassing and wearing excitement which so\r\nconstantly goads him.\r\n\r\n16. THE DESIRE OF GOOD.--The desire of good for its own sake--this is\r\nLove. The desire of good for bodily pleasure--this is Lust. Man is a\r\nmoral being, and as such should always act in the animal sphere\r\naccording to the spiritual law. Hence, to break the law of the highest\r\ncreative action for the mere gratification of animal instinct is to\r\nperform the act of sin and to produce the corruption of nature.\r\n\r\n17. CAUSE OF PROSTITUTION.--Dr. Dio Lewis says: \"Occasionally we meet a\r\ndiseased female with excessive animal passion, but such a case is\r\nvery rare. The average woman has so little sexual desire that if\r\nlicentiousness depended upon her, uninfluenced by her desire to please\r\nman or secure his support, there would be very little sexual excess.\r\nMan is strong he has all the money and all the facilities for business\r\nand pleasure; and woman is not long in learning the road to his favor.\r\nMany prostitutes who take no pleasure in their unclean intimacies not\r\nonly endure a disgusting life for the favor and means thus gained,\r\nbut affect intense passion in their sexual contacts because they have\r\nlearned that such exhibitions gratify men.\"\r\n\r\n18. HUSBAND'S BRUTALITY.--Husbands! It is your licentiousness that\r\ndrives your wives to a deed so abhorrent to their every wifely,\r\nwomanly and maternal instinct a deed which ruins the health of their\r\nbodies, prostitutes their souls, and makes marriage, maternity and\r\nwomanhood itself degrading and loathsome. No terms can sufficiently\r\ncharacterize the cruelty, meanness and disgusting selfishness of your\r\nconduct when you impose on them a maternity so detested as to drive\r\nthem to the desperation of killing their unborn children and often\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n19. WHAT DRUNKARDS BEQUEATH TO THEIR OFFSPRING.--Organic imperfections\r\nunfit the brain for sane action, and habit confirms the insane\r\ncondition; the man's brain has become unsound. Then comes in the\r\nlaw of hereditary descent, by which the brain of a man's children\r\nis fashioned after his own not as it was originally, but as it has\r\nbecome, in consequence of frequent functional disturbance. Hence,\r\nof all appetites, the inherited appetite for drunkenness is the most\r\ndireful. Natural laws contemplate no exceptions, and sins against them\r\nare never pardoned.\r\n\r\n20. THE REPORTS OF HOSPITALS.--The reports of hospitals for lunatics\r\nalmost universally assign intemperance as one of the causes which\r\npredispose a man's offspring to insanity. This is even more strikingly\r\nmanifested in the case of congenital idiocy. They come generally from\r\na class of families which seem to have degenerated physically to a low\r\ndegree. They are puny and sickly.\r\n\r\n21. SECRET DISEASES.--See the weakly, sickly and diseased children who\r\nare born only to suffer and die, all because of the private disease\r\nof the father before his marriage. Oh, let the truth be told that the\r\nyoung men of our land may learn the lessons of purity of life. Let\r\nthem learn that in morality there is perfect protection and happiness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GETTING A DIVORCE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DEGENERATE TURK.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL AND MORAL DEGENERACY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. MORAL PRINCIPLE.--\"Edgar Allen Poe, Lord Byron, and Robert Burns,\"\r\nsays Dr. Geo. F. Hall, \"were men of marvelous strength intellectually.\r\nBut measured by the true rule of high moral principle, they were very\r\nweak. Superior endowment in a single direction--physical, mental, or\r\nspiritual--is not of itself sufficient to make one strong in all that\r\nthat heroic word means.\r\n\r\n2. INSANE ASYLUM.--many a good man spiritually has gone to an untimely\r\ngrave because of impaired physical powers. Many a good man spiritually\r\nhas gone to the insane asylum because of bodily and mental weaknesses.\r\nMany a good man spiritually has fallen from virtue in an evil moment\r\nbecause of a weakened will, or a too demanding fleshly passion, or,\r\nworse than either, too lax views on the subject of personal chastity.\"\r\n\r\n3. BOYS LEARNING VICES.--some ignorant and timid people argue that\r\nboys and young men in reading a work of this character will learn\r\nvices concerning which they had never so much as dreamed of before.\r\nThis is, however, certain, that vices cannot be condemned unless they\r\nare mentioned; and if the condemnation is strong enough it surely will\r\nbe a source of strength and of security. If light and education, on\r\nthese important subjects, does injury, then all knowledge likewise\r\nmust do more wrong than good. Knowledge is power, and the only hope of\r\nthe race is enlightenment on all subjects pertaining to their being.\r\n\r\n4. MORAL MANHOOD.--it is clearly visible that the American manhood\r\nis rotting down--decaying at the center. The present generation shows\r\nmany men of a small body and weak principles, and men and women\r\nof this kind are becoming more and more prevalent. Dissipation\r\nand indiscretions of all kind are working ruin. Purity of life and\r\ntemperate habits are being too generally disregarded.\r\n\r\n5. YOUNG WOMEN.--the vast majority of graduates from the schools and\r\ncolleges of our land to-day, and two-thirds of the membership of our\r\nchurches, and three-fourths of the charitable workers, are females.\r\nEverywhere girls are carrying off most of the prizes in competitive\r\nexaminations, because women, as a sex, naturally maintain a better\r\ncharacter, take better care of their bodies, and are less addicted\r\nto bad and injurious habits. While all this is true in reference to\r\nfemales, you will find that the male sex furnishes almost the entire\r\nnumber of criminals. The saloons, gambling dens, the brothels, and bad\r\nliterature are drawing down all that the public schools can build\r\nup. Seventy per cent. Of the young men of this land do not darken the\r\nchurch door. They are not interested in moral improvement or moral\r\neducation. Eighty-five per cent. Leave school under 15 years of age;\r\nprefer the loafer's honors to the benefit of school.\r\n\r\n6. PROMOTION.--the world is full of good places for good young men,\r\nand all the positions of trust now occupied by the present generation\r\nwill soon be filled by the competent young men of the coming\r\ngeneration; and he that keeps his record clean, lives a pure life, and\r\navoids excesses or dissipations of all kinds, and fortifies his life\r\nwith good habits, is the young man who will be heard from, and a\r\nthousand places will be open for his services.\r\n\r\n7. PERSONAL PURITY.--Dr. George F. Hall says: \"why not pay careful\r\nattention to man in all his elements of strength, physical, mental,\r\nand moral? Why not make personal purity a fixed principle in the\r\nmanhood of the present and coming generation, and thus insure the best\r\nmen the world has ever seen? It can be done. Let every reader of these\r\nlines resolve that he will be one to help do it.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Charles Dickens' chair and desk.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIMMORALITY, DISEASE AND DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE POLICY OF SILENCE.--there is no greater delusion than to\r\nsuppose that vast number of boys know nothing about practices of sin.\r\nSome parents are afraid that unclean thoughts may be suggested by\r\nthese very defences. The danger is slight. Such cases are barely\r\npossible, but when the untold thousands are thought of on the other\r\nside, who have been demoralized from childhood through ignorance, and\r\nwho are to-day suffering the result of these vicious practices,\r\nthe policy of silence stands condemned, and intelligent knowledge\r\nabundantly justified. The emphatic words of scripture are true in this\r\nrespect also, \"the people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.\"\r\n\r\n2. LIVING ILLUSTRATION.--without fear of truthful contradiction, we\r\naffirm that the homes, public assemblies, and streets of all our\r\nlarge cities abound to-day with living illustrations and proofs of the\r\nwidespread existence of this physical and moral scourge. An enervated\r\nand stunted manhood, a badly developed physique, a marked absence\r\nof manly and womanly strength and beauty, are painfully common\r\neverywhere. Boys and girls, young men and women, exist by thousands,\r\nof whom it may be said, they were badly born and ill-developed. Many\r\nof them are, to some extent, bearing the penalty of the [transcriber's\r\nnote: the text appears to read \"sins\" but it is unclear] and excesses\r\nof their parents, especially their fathers, whilst the great majority\r\nare reaping the fruits of their own immorality in a dwarfed and\r\nill-formed body, and effeminate appearance, weak and enervated mind.\r\n\r\n3. EFFEMINATE AND SICKLY YOUNG MEN.--the purposeless and aimless life\r\nof any number of effeminate and sickly young men, is to be distinctly\r\nattributed to these sins. The large class of mentally impotent\r\n\"ne'er-do-wells\" are being constantly recruited and added to by those\r\nwho practice what the celebrated Erichson calls \"that hideous sin\r\nengendered by vice, and practiced in solitude\"--the sin, be it\r\nobserved, which is the common cause of physical and mental weakness,\r\nand of the fearfully impoverishing night-emissions, or as they are\r\ncommonly called, \"wet-dreams.\"\r\n\r\n4. WEAKNESS, DISEASE, DEFORMITY, AND DEATH.--Through self-pollution\r\nand fornication the land is being corrupted with weakness, disease,\r\ndeformity, and death. We regret to say that we cannot speak with\r\nconfidence concerning the moral character of the Jew; but we have\r\npeople amongst us who have deservedly a high character for the tone of\r\ntheir moral life--we refer to the members of the Society of Friends.\r\nThe average of life amongst these reaches no less than fifty-six\r\nyears; and, whilst some allowance must be made for the fact that\r\namongst the Friends the poor have not a large representation, these\r\nfigures show conclusively the soundness of this position.\r\n\r\n5. SOWING THEIR WILD OATS.--It is monstrous to suppose that healthy\r\nchildren should die just as they are coming to manhood. The fact that\r\nthousands of young people do reach the age of sixteen or eighteen, and\r\nthen decline and die, should arouse parents to ask the question: Why?\r\nCertainly it would not be difficult to tell the reason in thousands\r\nof instances, and yet the habit and practice of the deadly sin of\r\nself-pollution is actually ignored; it is even spoken of as a boyish\r\nfolly not to be mentioned, and young men literally burning up with\r\nlust are mildly spoken of as \"sowing their wild oats.\" Thus the\r\ncemetery is being filled with masses of the youth of America who, as\r\nin Egypt of old, fill up the graves of uncleanness and lust. Some time\r\nsince a prominent Christian man was taking exception to my addressing\r\nmen on this subject; observe this! one of his own sons was at that\r\nvery time near the lunatic asylum through these disgusting sins. What\r\nfolly and madness this is!\r\n\r\n6. DEATH TO TRUE MANHOOD.--The question for each one is, \"In what way\r\nare you going to divert the courses of the streams of energy which\r\npertain to youthful vigor and manhood?\" To be destitute of that which\r\nmay be described as raw material in the human frame, means that no\r\nreally vigorous manhood can have place; to burn up the juices of the\r\nsystem in the fires of lust is madness and wanton folly, but it can be\r\ndone. To divert the currents of life and energy from blood and brain,\r\nfrom memory and muscle, in order to secrete it for the shambles of\r\nprostitution, is death to true manhood; but remember, it can be done!\r\nThe generous liquid life may inspire the brain and blood with noble\r\nimpulse and vital force, or it may be sinned away and drained out of\r\nthe system until the jaded brain, the faded cheek, the enervated young\r\nmanhood, the gray hair, narrow chest, weak voice, and the enfeebled\r\nmind show another victim in the long catalogue of the degraded through\r\nlust.\r\n\r\n7. THE SISTERHOOD OF SHAME AND DEATH.--Whenever we pass the sisterhood\r\nof death, and hear the undertone of song, which is one of the harlot's\r\nmethods of advertising, let us recall the words, that these represent\r\nthe \"pestilence which walketh in darkness, the destruction that\r\nwasteth at noonday.\" The allusion, of course, is to the fact that the\r\ngreat majority of these harlots are full of loathsome physical and\r\nmoral disease; with the face and form of an angel, these women \"bite\r\nlike a serpent and sting like an adder;\" their traffic is not for\r\nlife, but inevitably for shame, disease, and death. Betrayed and\r\nseduced themselves, they in their turn betray and curse others.\r\n\r\n8. WARNING OTHERS.--Have you never been struck with the argument\r\nof the Apostle, who, warning others from the corrupt example of the\r\nfleshy Esau, said, \"Lest there be any fornicator or profane person as\r\nEsau, who for one mess of meat sold his own birthright. For ye know\r\nthat even afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he\r\nwas rejected, he found no place for repentance, though he sought it\r\ndiligently with tears.\" Terrible and striking words are these. His\r\nbirthright sold for a mess of meat. The fearful costs of sin--yes,\r\nthat is the thought, particularly the sin of fornication! Engrave that\r\nword upon your memories and hearts--\"One mess of meat.\"\r\n\r\n9. THE HARLOT'S MESS OF MEAT.--Remember it, young men, when you are\r\ntempted to this sin. For a few minutes' sensual pleasure, for a mess\r\nof harlot's meat, young men are paying out the love of the son and\r\nbrother; they are deceiving, lying, and cheating for a mess of meat;\r\nfor a mess, not seldom of putrid flesh, men have paid down purity and\r\nprayer, manliness and godliness; for a mess of meat some perhaps have\r\ndonned their best attire, and assumed the manners of the gentleman,\r\nand then, like an infernal hypocrite flogged the steps of maiden or\r\nharlot to satisfy their degrading lust; for a mess of meat young men\r\nhave deceived father and mother, and shrunk from the embrace of\r\nlove of the pure-minded sister. For the harlot's mess of meat some\r\nlistening to me have spent scores of hours of invaluable time. They\r\nhave wearied the body, diseased and demoralized the mind. The pocket\r\nhas been emptied, theft committed, lies unnumbered told, to play the\r\npart of the harlot's mate--perchance a six-foot fool, dragged into\r\nthe filth and mire of the harlot's house. You called her your friend,\r\nwhen, but for her mess of meat, you would have passed her like dirt in\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\n10. SEEING LIFE.--You consorted with her for your mutual shame and\r\ndeath, and then called it \"seeing life.\" Had your mother met you, you\r\nwould have shrunk away like a craven cur. Had your sister interviewed\r\nyou, she had blushed to bear your name; or had she been seen by you in\r\ncompany with some other whoremaster, for similar commerce, you would\r\nhave wished that she had been dead. Now what think you of this \"seeing\r\nlife?\" And it is for this that tens of thousands of strong men in our\r\nlarge cities are selling their birthright.\r\n\r\n11. THE DEVIL'S DECOYS.--Some may be ready to affirm that physical and\r\nmoral penalties do not appear to overtake all men; that many men known\r\nto be given to intemperance and sensuality are strong, well, and live\r\nto a good age. Let us not make any mistake concerning these; they are\r\nexceptions to the rule; the appearance of health in them is but the\r\ngrossness of sensuality. You have only carefully to look into the\r\nfaces of these men to see that their countenances, eyes, and speech\r\nbetray them. They are simply the devil's decoys.\r\n\r\n12. GROSSNESS OF SENSUALITY.--The poor degraded harlot draws in the\r\nvictims like a heavily charged lodestone; these men are found in large\r\nnumbers throughout the entire community; they would make fine men were\r\nthey not weighted with the grossness of sensuality; as it is, they\r\nfrequent the race-course, the card-table, the drinking-saloon, the\r\nmusic-hall, and the low theaters, which abound in our cities and\r\ntowns; the great majority of these are men of means and leisure.\r\nIdleness is their curse, their opportunity for sin; you may know them\r\nas the loungers over refreshment-bars, as the retailers of the latest\r\nfilthy joke, or as the vendors of some disgusting scandal; indeed, it\r\nis appalling the number of these lepers found both in our business and\r\nsocial circles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PALESTINE WATER CARRIERS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPOISONOUS LITERATURE AND BAD PICTURES.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. OBSCENE LITERATURE.--No other source contributes so much to sexual\r\nimmorality as obscene literature. The mass of stories published in the\r\ngreat weeklies and the cheap novels are mischievous. When the devil\r\ndetermines to take charge of a young soul, be often employs a\r\nvery ingenious method. He slyly hands a little novel filled with\r\n\"voluptuous forms,\" \"reclining on bosoms,\" \"languishing eyes,\" etc.\r\n\r\n2. MORAL FORCES.--The world is full of such literature. It is easily\r\naccessible, for it is cheap, and the young will procure it, and\r\ntherefore become easy prey to its baneful influence and effects. It\r\nweakens the moral forces of the young, and they thereby fall an easy\r\nprey before the subtle schemes of the libertine.\r\n\r\n3. BAD BOOKS.--Bad books play not a small part in the corruption of the\r\nyouth. A bad book is as bad as an evil companion. In some respects it\r\nis even worse than a living teacher of vice, since it may cling to an\r\nindividual at all times. It will follow him and poison his mind with\r\nthe venom of evil. The influence of bad books in making bad boys and\r\nmen is little appreciated. Few are aware how much evil seed is being\r\nsown among the young everywhere through the medium of vile books.\r\n\r\n4. SENSATIONAL STORY BOOKS.--Much of the evil literature which is sold\r\nin nickel and dime novels, and which constitutes the principal part\r\nof the contents of such papers as the \"Police Gazette,\" the \"Police\r\nNews,\" and a large proportion of the sensational story books which\r\nflood the land. You might better place a coal of fire or a live viper\r\nin your bosom, than allow yourself to read such a book. The thoughts\r\nthat are implanted in the mind in youth will often stick there through\r\nlife, in spite of all efforts to dislodge them.\r\n\r\n5. PAPERS AND MAGAZINES.--Many of the papers and magazines sold at\r\nour news stands, and eagerly sought after by young men and boys, are\r\nbetter suited for the parlors of a house of ill-fame than for the\r\neyes of pure-minded youth. A newsdealer who will distribute such vile\r\nsheets ought to be dealt with as an educator in vice and crime, an\r\nagent of evil, and a recruiting officer of hell and perdition.\r\n\r\n6. SENTIMENTAL LITERATURE OF LOW FICTION.--Sentimental literature,\r\nwhether impure in its subject matter or not, has a direct tendency in\r\nthe direction of impurity. The stimulation of the emotional nature,\r\nthe instilling of sentimental ideas into the minds of the young, has\r\na tendency to turn the thoughts into a channel which leads in the\r\ndirection of the formation of vicious habits.\r\n\r\n7. IMPRESSIONS LEFT BY READING QUESTIONABLE LITERATURE.--It is\r\npainful to see strong intelligent men and youths reading bad books,\r\nor feasting their eyes on filthy pictures, for the practice is sure\r\nto affect their personal purity. Impressions will be left which cannot\r\nfail to breed a legion of impure thoughts, and in many instances\r\ncriminal deeds. Thousands of elevator boys, clerks, students,\r\ntraveling men, and others, patronize the questionable literature\r\ncounter to an alarming extent.\r\n\r\n8. THE NUDE IN ART.--For years there has been a great craze after\r\nthe nude in art, and the realistic in literature. Many art galleries\r\nabound in pictures and statuary which cannot fail to fan the fires\r\nof sensualism, unless the thoughts of the visitor are trained to the\r\nstrictest purity. Why should artists and sculptors persist in shocking\r\nthe finer sensibilities of old and young of both sexes by crowding\r\nupon their view representations of naked human forms in attitudes of\r\nluxurious abandon? Public taste may demand it. But let those who have\r\nthe power endeavor to reform public taste.\r\n\r\n9. WIDELY DIFFUSED.--Good men have ever lamented the pernicious\r\ninfluence of a depraved and perverted literature. But such literature\r\nhas never been so systematically and widely diffused as at the present\r\ntime. This is owing to two causes, its cheapness and the facility of\r\nconveyance.\r\n\r\n10. INFLAME THE PASSIONS.--A very large proportion of the works thus\r\nput in circulation are of the worst character, tending to corrupt\r\nthe principles, to inflame the passions, to excite impure desire,\r\nand spread a blight over all the powers of the soul. Brothels are\r\nrecruited from this more than any other source. Those who search the\r\ntrunks of convicted criminals are almost sure to find in them one of\r\nmore of these works; and few prisoners who can read at all fail to\r\nenumerate among the causes which led them into crime the unhealthy\r\nstimulus of this depraved and poisonous literature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSTARTLING SINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. NAMELESS CRIMES.--The nameless crimes identified with the hushed-up\r\nSodomite cases; the revolting condition of the school of Sodomy; the\r\nrevelations of the Divorce Court concerning the condition of what is\r\ncalled national nobility, and upper classes, as well as the unclean\r\nspirit which attaches to \"society papers,\" has revealed a condition\r\nwhich is perfectly disgusting.\r\n\r\n2. UNFAITHFULNESS.--Unfaithfulness amongst husbands and wives in the\r\nupper classes is common and adultery rife everywhere; mistresses are\r\nkept in all directions; thousands of these rich men have at least two,\r\nand not seldom three establishments.\r\n\r\n3. A FRIGHTFUL INCREASE.--Facts which have come to light during\r\nthe past ten years show a frightful increase in every form of\r\nlicentiousness; the widely extended area over which whoredom and\r\ndegrading lust have thrown the glamor of their fascinating toils is\r\nsimply appalling.\r\n\r\n4. MORAL CARNAGE.--We speak against the fearful moral carnage; would\r\nto God that some unmistakable manifestation of the wrath of God\r\nshould come in and put a stop to this huge seed-plot of national\r\ndemoralization! We are reaping in this disgusting center the harvest\r\nof corruption which has come from the toleration and encouragements\r\ngiven by the legislature, the police, and the magistrates to\r\nimmorality, vice and sin; the awful fact is that we are in the midst\r\nof the foul and foetid harvest of lust. Aided by some of the most\r\nexalted personages in the land, assisted by thousands of educated\r\nand wealthy whoremongers and adulterers, we are reaping also, in\r\nindividual physical ugliness and deformity, that which has been sown;\r\nthe puny, ill-formed and mentally weak youths and maidens, men and\r\nwomen, to be seen in large numbers in our principal towns and cities,\r\nrepresent the widespread nature of the curse, which has, in a marked\r\nmanner, impaired the physique, the morality, and the intelligence of\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\n5. DAILY PRESS.--The daily press has not had the moral courage to\r\nsay one word; the quality of demoralizing novels such as have been\r\nproduced from the impure brain and unclean imaginations; the subtle,\r\nclever and fascinating undermining of the white-winged angel of purity\r\nby modern sophists, whose purient and vicious volumes were written to\r\nthrow a halo of charm and beauty about the brilliant courtesan and\r\nthe splendid adulteress; the mixing up of lust and love; the making\r\nof corrupt passion to stand in the garb of a deep, lasting, and holy\r\naffection--these are some of the hidious seedlings which, hidden amid\r\nthe glamor and fascination of the seeming \"angel of light,\" have to so\r\nlarge an extent corrupted the morality of the country.\r\n\r\n6. NIGHTLY EXHIBITIONS.--Some of you know what the nightly exhibitions\r\nin these garlanded temples of whorish incentive are. There is\r\nthe variety theatre with its disgusting ballet dancing, and its\r\nshamelessly indecent photographs exhibited in every direction. What a\r\nclear gain to morality it would be if the accursed houses were burnt\r\ndown, and forbidden by law ever to be re-built or re-opened; the\r\nwhole scene is designed to act upon and stimulate the lusts and evil\r\npassions of corrupt men and women.\r\n\r\n7. CONFIDENCE AND EXPOSURE.--I hear some of you say, cannot some\r\ninfluence be brought to bear upon this plague-spot? Will the\r\nlegislature or congress do nothing? Is the law and moral right to\r\ncontinue to be trodden under foot? Are the magistrates and the police\r\npowerless? The truth is, the harlots and whoremongers are master of\r\nthe situation; the moral sense of the legislators, the magistrates,\r\nand the police is so low that anything like confidence is at present\r\nout of the question.\r\n\r\n8. THE SISTERHOOD OF SHAME AND DEATH.--It is enough to make angels\r\nweep to see a great mass of America's wealthy and better-class sons\r\nfull of zeal and on fire with interest in the surging hundreds of\r\nthe sisterhood of shame and death. Many of these men act as if they\r\nwere--if they do not believe they are--dogs. No poor hunted dog in the\r\nstreets was ever tracked by a yelping crowd of curs more than is the\r\nfresh girl or chance of a maid in the accursed streets of our large\r\ncities. Price is no object, nor parentage, nor home; it is the truth\r\nto affirm that hundreds and thousands of well-dressed and educated\r\nmen come in order to the gratification of their lusts, and to this end\r\nthey frequent this whole district; they have reached this stage,\r\nthey are being burned up in this fire of lust; men of whom God says,\r\n\"Having eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease sin.\"\r\n\r\n9. LAW MAKERS.--Now should any member of the legislature rise up and\r\ntestify against this \"earthly hell,\" and speak in defence of the moral\r\nmanhood and womanhood of the nation, he would be greeted as a fanatic,\r\nand laughed down amid derisive cheers; such has been the experience\r\nagain and again. Therefore attack this great stronghold which for the\r\npast thirty years has warred and is warring against our social manhood\r\nand womanhood, and constantly undermining the moral life of the\r\nnation; against this citadel of licentiousness, this metropolitan\r\ncentre of crime, and vice, and sin, direct your full blast of\r\nrighteous and manly indignation.\r\n\r\n10. TEMPLES OF LUST.--Here stand the foul and splendid temples of\r\nlust, intemperance, and passion, into whose vortex tens of thousands\r\nof our sons and daughters are constantly being drawn. Let it be\r\nremembered that this whole area represents the most costly conditions,\r\nand proves beyond Question that an enormous proportion of the wealthy\r\nmanhood of the nation, and we as citizens sustain, partake, and share\r\nin this carnival of death. Is it any wonder that the robust type\r\nof godly manhood which used to be found in the legislature is sadly\r\nwanting now, or that the wretched caricatures of manhood which find\r\nform and place in such papers as \"Truth\" and the \"World\" are accepted\r\nas representing \"modern society?\"\r\n\r\n11. PURITANIC MANHOOD.--It is a melancholy fact that, by reason of\r\nuncleanness, we have almost lost regard for the type of puritanic\r\nmanhood which in the past held aloft the standard of a chaste and\r\nholy life; such men in this day are spoken of as \"too slow\" as\r\n\"weak-kneed,\" and \"goody-goody\" men. Let me recall that word, the\r\nfast and indecently-dressed \"things,\" the animals of easy virtue, the\r\n\"respectable\" courtesans that flirt, chaff, gamble, and waltz\r\nwith well-known high-class licentious lepers--such is the ideal of\r\nwomanhood which a large proportion of our large city society accepts,\r\nfawns upon, and favors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n12. SHAMEFUL CONDITIONS.--Perhaps one of the most inhuman and shameful\r\nconditions of modern fashionable society, both in England and America,\r\nis that which wealthy men and women who are married destroy their own\r\nchildren in the embryo stage of being, and become murderers thereby.\r\nThis is done to prevent what should become one of our chief glories,\r\nviz., large and well-developed [Transcriber's note: the text appears\r\nto read \"home\" but it is unclear] and family life.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE PROSTITUTION OF MEN.\r\n\r\nCAUSE AND REMEDY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. EXPOSED YOUTH.--Generally even in the beginning of the period when\r\nsexual uneasiness begins to show itself in the boy, he is exposed in\r\nschools, institutes, and elsewhere to the temptations of secret\r\nvice, which is transmitted from youth to youth, like a contagious\r\ncorruption, and which in thousands destroys the first germs of\r\nvirility. Countless numbers of boys are addicted to these vices for\r\nyears. That they do not in the beginning of nascent puberty proceed to\r\nsexual intercourse with women, is generally due to youthful timidity,\r\nwhich dares not reveal its desire, or from want of experience for\r\nfinding opportunities. The desire is there, for the heart is already\r\ncorrupted.\r\n\r\n2. BOYHOOD TIMIDITY OVERCOME.--Too often a common boy's timidity is\r\novercome by chance or by seduction, which is rarely lacking in great\r\ncities where prostitution is flourishing, and thus numbers of boys\r\nimmediately after the transition period of youth, in accordance with\r\nthe previous secret practice, accustom themselves to the association\r\nwith prostitute women, and there young manhood and morals are soon\r\nlost forever.\r\n\r\n3. MARRIAGE-BED RESOLUTIONS.--Most men of the educated classes enter\r\nthe marriage-bed with the consciousness of leaving behind them a whole\r\narmy of prostitutes or seduced women, in whose arms they cooled their\r\npassions and spent the vigor of their youth. But with such a past the\r\nmarried man does not at the same time leave behind him its influence\r\non his inclinations. The habit of having a feminine being at his\r\ndisposal for every rising appetite, and the desire for change\r\ninordinately indulged for years, generally make themselves felt again\r\nas soon as the honeymoon is over. Marriage will not make a morally\r\ncorrupt man all at once a good man and a model husband.\r\n\r\n4. THE INJUSTICE OF MAN.--Now, although many men are in a certain\r\nsense \"not worthy to unloose the latchet of the shoes\" of the\r\ncommonest woman, much less to \"unfasten her girdle,\" yet they make\r\nthe most extravagant demands on the feminine sex. Even the greatest\r\ndebauchee, who has spent his vigor in the arms of a hundred\r\ncourtesans, will cry out fraud and treachery if he does not receive\r\nhis newly married bride as an untouched virgin. Even the most\r\ndissolute husband will look on his wife as deserving of death if his\r\ndaily infidelity is only once reciprocated.\r\n\r\n5. UNJUST DEMANDS.--The greater the injustice a husband does to his\r\nwife, the less he is willing to submit to from her; the oftener he\r\nbecomes unfaithful to her, the stricter he is in demanding\r\nfaithfulness from her. We see that despotism nowhere denies its own\r\nnature: the more a despot deceives and abuses his people, the more\r\nsubmissiveness and faithfulness he demands of them.\r\n\r\n6. SUFFERING WOMEN.--Who can be astonished at the many unhappy\r\nmarriages, if he knows how unworthy most men are of their wives? Their\r\nvirtues they rarely can appreciate, and their vices they generally\r\ncall out by their own. Thousands of women suffer from the results of\r\na mode of life of which they, having remained pure in their thought,\r\nhave no conception whatever; and many an unsuspecting wife nurses her\r\nhusband with tenderest care in sicknesses which are nothing more than\r\nthe consequences of his amours with other women.\r\n\r\n7. AN INHUMAN CRIMINAL.--When at last, after long years of delusion\r\nand endurance, the scales drop from the eyes of the wife, and revenge\r\nor despair drives her into a hostile position towards her lord and\r\nmaster, she is an inhuman criminal, and the hue and cry against the\r\nfickleness of women and the falsity of their nature is endless. Oh,\r\nthe injustice of society and the injustice of cruel man. Is there no\r\nrelief for helpless women that are bound by the ties of marriage to\r\nmen who are nothing but rotten corruption?\r\n\r\n8. VULGAR DESIRE.--The habit of regarding the end and aim of woman\r\nonly from the most vulgar side--not to respect in her the noble human\r\nbeing, but to see in her only the instrument of sensual desire--is\r\ncarried so far among men that they will allow it to force into the\r\nbackground considerations among themselves, which they otherwise\r\npretend to rank very high.\r\n\r\n9. THE ONLY REMEDY.--But when the feeling of women has once been\r\ndriven to indignation with respect to the position which they\r\noccupy, it is to be hoped that they will compel men to be pure before\r\nmarriage, and they will remain loyal after marriage.\r\n\r\n10. WORSE THAN SAVAGES.--With all our civilization we are put to shame\r\neven by the savages. The savages know of no fastidiousness of the\r\nsexual instinct and of no brothels. We are, indeed, likewise savages,\r\nbut in quite a different sense. Proof of this is especially furnished\r\nby our youth. But that our students, and young men in general, usually\r\npass through the school of corruption and drag the filth of the road\r\nwhich they have traversed before marriage along with them throughout\r\nlife, is not their fault so much as the fault of prejudices and of our\r\npolitical and social conditions that prohibits a proper education, and\r\nthe placing of the right kind of literature on these subjects into the\r\nhands of young people.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n11. REASON AND REMEDY.--Keep the youth pure by a thorough system\r\nof plain unrestricted training. The seeds of immorality are sown in\r\nyouth, and the secret vice eats out their young manhood often before\r\nthe age of puberty. They develop a bad character as they grow older.\r\nYoung girls are ruined, and licentiousness and prostitution flourish.\r\nKeep the boys pure and the harlot would soon lose her vocation.\r\nElevate the morals of the boys, and you will have pure men and moral\r\nhusbands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUICIDE LAKE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE ROAD TO SHAME.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. INSULT TO MOTHER OR SISTER.--Young men, it can never tinder any\r\ncircumstances be right for you to do to a woman that, which, if\r\nanother man did to your mother or sister, you could never forgive!\r\nThe very thought is revolting. Let us suppose a man guilty of this\r\nshameful sin, and I apprehend that each of us would feel ready to\r\nshoot the villain. We are not justifying the shooting, but appealing\r\nto your instinctive sense of right, in order to show the enormity\r\nof this fearful crime, and to fasten strong conviction in your mind\r\nagainst this sin.\r\n\r\n2. A RUINED SISTER.--What would you think of a man, no matter what his\r\nwealth, culture, or gentlemanly bearing, who should lay himself out\r\nfor the seduction and shame of your beloved sister? Her very name now\r\nreminds you of the purest affection: think of her, if you can bear it,\r\nruined in character, and soon to become an unhappy mother. To whom can\r\nyou introduce her? What can you say concerning her? How can her own\r\nbrothers and sisters associate with her? and, mark! all this personal\r\nand relative misery caused by this genteel villain's degrading\r\npassion.\r\n\r\n3. YOUNG MAN LOST.--Another terrible result of this sin is the\r\npractical overthrow of natural affection which it effects. A young man\r\ncomes from his father's house to Chicago. Either through his own\r\nlust or through the corrupt companions that he finds in the house of\r\nbusiness where he resides, he becomes the companion of lewd women. The\r\nimmediate result is a bad conscience, a sense of shame, and a breach\r\nin the affections of home. Letters are less frequent, careless, and\r\nbrief. He cannot manifest true love now. He begins to shrink from his\r\nsister and mother, and well he may.\r\n\r\n4. THE HARLOT'S INFLUENCE.--He has spent the strength of his affection\r\nand love for home. In their stead the wretched harlot has filled him\r\nwith unholy lust. His brain and heart refuse to yield him the love of\r\nthe son and brother. His hand can not write as aforetime, or at\r\nbest, his expressions become a hypocritical pretence. Fallen into\r\nthe degradation of the fornicator, he has changed a mother's love and\r\nsister's affection for the cursed fellowship of the woman \"whose house\r\nis the way to hell.\" (Prov. VII. 27.)\r\n\r\n5. THE WAY OF DEATH.--Observe, that directly the law of God is broken,\r\nand wherever promiscuous intercourse between the sexes takes place,\r\ngonorrhoea, syphilis, and every other form of venereal disease is\r\nseen in hideous variety. It is only true to say that thousands of both\r\nsexes are slain annually by these horrible diseases. What must be\r\nthe moral enormity of a sin, which, when committed, produces in vast\r\nnumbers of cases such frightful physical and moral destruction as that\r\nwhich is here portrayed?\r\n\r\n6. A HARLOT'S WOES.--Would to God that something might be done to\r\nrescue fallen women from their low estate. We speak of them as \"fallen\r\nwomen\". Fallen, indeed, they are, but surely not more deserving of the\r\napplication of that term than the \"fallen men\" who are their partners\r\nand paramours. It is easy to use the words \"a fallen woman,\" but who\r\ncan apprehend all that is involved in the expression, seeing\r\nthat every purpose for which God created woman is prostituted and\r\ndestroyed? She is now neither maiden, wife, nor mother; the sweet\r\nnames of sister and betrothed can have no legitimate application in\r\nher case.\r\n\r\n7. THE PENALTIES FOR LOST VIRTUE.--Can the harlot be welcomed where\r\neither children, brothers, sisters, wife, or husband are found?\r\nSurely, no. Home is a sphere alien to the harlot's estate. See such\r\nan one wherever you may--she is a fallen outcast from woman's high\r\nestate. Her existence--for she does not live--now culminates in one\r\ndread issue, viz., prostitution. She sleeps, but awakes a harlot. She\r\nrises in the late morning hours, but her object is prostitution; she\r\nwashes, dresses, and braids her hair, but it is with one foul purpose\r\nbefore her. To this end she eats, drinks, and is clothed. To this end\r\nher house is hidden and the blinds are drawn.\r\n\r\n8. LOST FOREVER.--To this end she applies the unnatural cosmetique,\r\nand covers herself with sweet perfumes, which vainly try to hide her\r\ndisease and shame. To this end she decks herself with dashing finery\r\nand tawdry trappings, and with bold, unwomanly mien essays the streets\r\nof the great city. To this end she is loud and coarse and impudent.\r\nTo this end she is the prostituted \"lady,\" with simpering words, and\r\nsmiles, and glamour of refined deceit. To this end an angel face, a\r\ndevil in disguise. There is one foul and ghastly purpose towards which\r\nall her energies now tend. So low has she fallen, so lost is she to\r\nall the design of woman, that she exists for one foul purpose only,\r\nviz., to excite, stimulate, and gratify the lusts of degraded, ungodly\r\nmen. Verily, the word \"prostitute\" has an awful meaning. What plummet\r\ncan sound the depths of a woman's fall who has become a harlot?\r\n\r\n9. SOUND THE ALARM.--Remember, young man, you can never rise above the\r\ndegradation of the companionship of lewd women. Your virtue once lost\r\nis lost forever. Remember, young woman, your wealth or riches is your\r\ngood name and good character--you have nothing else. Give a man your\r\nvirtue and he will forsake you, and you will be forsaken by all the\r\nworld. Remember that purity of purpose brings nobility of character,\r\nand an honorable life is the joy and security of mankind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREAT PHILANTHROPIST.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE CURSE OF MANHOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. MORAL LEPERS.--We cannot but denounce, in the strongest terms,\r\nthe profligacy of many married men. Not content with the moderation\r\npermitted in the divine appointed relationship of marriage, they\r\nbecome adulterers, in order to gratify their accursed lust. The man in\r\nthem is trodden down by the sensual beast which reigns supreme.\r\nThese are the moral outlaws that make light of this scandalous social\r\niniquity, and by their damnable example encourage young men to sin.\r\n\r\n2. A SAD CONDITION.--It is constantly affirmed by prostitutes, that\r\namongst married men are found their chief supporters. Evidence\r\nfrom such a quarter must be received with considerable caution.\r\nNevertheless, we believe that there is much truth in this statement.\r\nHere, again, we lay the ax to the root of the tree; the married man\r\nwho dares affirm that there is a particle of physical necessity for\r\nthis sin, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. Whether these men be\r\nprinces, peers, legislators, professional men, mechanics, or workmen,\r\nthey are moral pests, a scandal to the social state, and a curse to\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\n3. EXCESSES.--Many married men exhaust themselves by these excesses;\r\nthey become irritable, liable to cold, to rheumatic affections, and\r\nnervous depression. They find themselves weary when they rise in\r\nthe morning. Unfitted for close application to business, they become\r\ndilatory and careless, often lapsing into entire lack of energy,\r\nand not seldom into the love of intoxicating stimulants. Numbers of\r\nhusbands and wives entering upon these experiences lose the charm\r\nof health, the cheerfulness of life and converse. Home duties become\r\nirksome to the wife; the brightness, vivacity, and bloom natural\r\nto her earlier years, decline; she is spoken of as highly nervous,\r\npoorly, and weak, when the whole truth is that she is suffering\r\nfrom physical exhaustion which she cannot bear. Her features become\r\nangular, her hair prematurely gray, she rapidly settles down into the\r\nnervous invalid, constantly needing medical aid, and, if possible,\r\nchange of air.\r\n\r\n4. IGNORANCE.--These conditions are brought about in many cases\r\nthrough ignorance on the part of those who are married. Multitudes of\r\nmen have neither read, heard, nor known the truth of this question.\r\nWe sympathize with our fellow-men in this, that we have been left in\r\npractical ignorance concerning the exceeding value and legitimate uses\r\nof these functions of our being. Some know, that, had they known these\r\nthings in the early days of their married life, it would have proved\r\nto them knowledge of exceeding value. If this counsel is followed,\r\nthousands of homes will scarcely know the need of the physician's\r\npresence.\r\n\r\n5. ANIMAL PASSION.--Commonsense teaches that children who are begotten\r\nin the heat of animal passion, are likely to be licentious when they\r\ngrow up. Many parents through excesses of eating and drinking,\r\nbecome inflamed with wine and strong drink. They are sensualists, and\r\nconsequently, morally diseased. Now, if in such conditions men beget\r\ntheir children, who can affect surprise if they develop licentious\r\ntendencies? Are not such parents largely to blame? Are they not\r\ncriminals in a high degree? Have they not fouled their own nest, and\r\ntransmitted to their children predisposition to moral evil?\r\n\r\n6. FAST YOUNG MEN.--Many of our \"fast young men\" have been thus\r\ncorrupted, even as the children of the intemperate are proved to have\r\nbeen. Certainly no one can deny that many of our \"well-bred\" young\r\nmen are little better than \"high-class dogs\" so lawless are they, and\r\nready for the arena of licentiousness.\r\n\r\n7. THE PURE-MINDED WIFE.--Happily, as tens of thousands of husbands\r\ncan testify, the pure-minded wife and mother is not carried away, as\r\nmen are liable to be, with the force of animal passion. Were it not\r\nso, the tendencies to licentiousness in many sons would be stronger\r\nthan they are. In the vast majority of cases suggestion is never made\r\nexcept by the husband, and it is a matter of deepest gratitude and\r\nconsideration, that the true wife may become a real helpmeet in\r\nrestraining this desire in the husband.\r\n\r\n8. YOUNG WIFE AND CHILDREN.--We often hear it stated that a young wife\r\nhas her children quickly. This cannot happen to the majority of women\r\nwithout injury to health and jeopardy to life. The law which rendered\r\nit imperative for the land to lie fallow in order to rest and gain\r\nrenewed strength, is only another illustration of the unity which\r\npervades physical conditions everywhere. It should be known that if\r\na mother nurses her own babe, and the child is not weaned until it\r\nis nine or ten months old, the mother, except in rare cases, will\r\nnot become enceinte again, though cohabitation with the husband takes\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n9. SELFISH AND UNNATURAL CONDUCT.--It is natural and rational that\r\na mother should feed her own children; in the selfish and unnatural\r\nconduct of many mothers, who, to avoid the self-denial and patience\r\nwhich are required, hand the little one over to the wet-nurse, or to\r\nbe brought up by hand, is found in many cases the cause and reason of\r\nthe unnatural haste of child-bearing. Mothers need to be taught that\r\nthe laws of nature cannot be broken without penalty. For every woman\r\nwhose health has been weakened through nursing her child, a hundred\r\nhave lost strength and health through marital excesses. The haste of\r\nhaving children is the costly penalty which women pay for shirking the\r\nmother's duty to the child.\r\n\r\n10. LAW OF GOD.--So graciously has the law of God been arranged in\r\nregard to the mother's strength, that, if it be obeyed, there will be,\r\nas a rule, an interval of at least from eighteen months to two years\r\nbetween the birth of one child and that of another. Every married\r\nman should abstain during certain natural seasons. In this periodical\r\nrecurrance God has instituted to every husband the law of restraint,\r\nand insisted upon self-control.\r\n\r\n11. TO YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE MARRIED.--Be exceedingly careful of\r\nlicense and excess in your intercourse with one another. Do not\r\nneedlessly expose, by undress, the body. Let not the purity of love\r\ndegenerate into unholy lust! See to it that you walk according to the\r\ndivine Word. \"Dwelling together as being heirs of the grace of life,\r\nthat your prayers be not hindered.\"\r\n\r\n12. LOST POWERS.--Many young men after their union showed a marked\r\ndifference. They lost much of their natural vivacity, energy, and\r\nstrength of voice. Their powers of application, as business men,\r\nstudents, and ministers, had declined, as also their enterprise,\r\nfervor, and kindliness. They had become irritable, dull, pale, and\r\ncomplaining. Many cases of rheumatic fever have been induced through\r\nimpoverishment, caused by excesses on the part of young married men.\r\n\r\n13. MIDDLE AGE.--After middle age the sap of a man's life declines\r\nin quantity. A man who intends close application to the ministry, to\r\nscientific or literary pursuits, where great demands are made upon\r\nthe brain, must restrain this passion. The supplies for the brain\r\nand nervous system are absorbed, and the seed diverted through sexual\r\nexcesses in the marriage relationship, by fornication, or by any other\r\nform of immorality, the man's power must decline: that to this very\r\ncause may be attributed the failure and breakdown of so many men of\r\nmiddle age.\r\n\r\n14. INTOXICATING DRINKS.--By all means avoid intoxicating drinks.\r\nImmorality and alcoholic stimulants, as we have shown, are intimately\r\nrelated to one another. Wine and strong drink inflame the blood, and\r\nheat the passions. Attacking the brain, they warp the judgment, and\r\nweaken the power of restraint. Avoid what is called good living: it is\r\nmadness to allow the pleasures of the table to corrupt and corrode the\r\nhuman body. We are not designed for gourmands, much less for educated\r\npigs. Cold water bathing, water as a beverage, simple and wholesome\r\nfood, regularity of sleep, plenty of exercise; games such as cricket,\r\nfootball, tennis, boating, or bicycling, are among the best possible\r\npreventives against lust and animal passion.\r\n\r\n15. BEWARE OF IDLENESS.--Indolent leisure means an unoccupied mind.\r\nWhen young men lounge along the streets, in this condition they become\r\nan easy prey to the sisterhood of shame and death. Bear in mind that\r\nevil thoughts precede evil actions. The hand of the worst thief will\r\nnot steal until the thief within operates upon the hand without. The\r\nmembers of the body which are capable of becoming instruments of sin,\r\nare not involuntary actors. Lustful desires must proceed from brain\r\nand heart, ere the fire that consumes burns in the member.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YOUNG LINCOLN STARTING TO SCHOOL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA PRIVATE TALK TO YOUNG MEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The most valuable and useful organs of the body are those which are\r\ncapable of the greatest dishonor, abuse and corruption. What a snare\r\nthe wonderful organism of the eye may become when used to read corrupt\r\nbooks or look upon licentious scenes at the theatre, or when used\r\nto meet the fascinating gaze of the harlot! What an instrument for\r\ndepraving the whole man may be found in the matchless powers of\r\nthe brain, the hand, the ear, the mouth, or the tongue! What potent\r\ninstruments may these become in accomplishing the ruin of the whole\r\nbeing for time and eternity!\r\n\r\n2. In like manner the organ concerning the uses of which I am\r\nto speak, has been, and continues to be, made one of the chief\r\ninstruments of man's immorality, shame, disease, and death. How\r\nimportant to know what the legitimate uses of this member of the body\r\nare, and how great the dignity conferred upon us in the possession of\r\nthis gift. On the human side this gift may be truly said to bring men\r\nnearer to the high and solemn relationship of the Creator than any\r\nother which they possess.\r\n\r\n3. I first deal with the destructive sin of self-abuse. There can be\r\nlittle doubt that vast numbers of boys are guilty of this practice.\r\nIn many cases the degrading habit has been taught by others, e.g.,\r\nby elder boys at school, where association largely results in mutual\r\ncorruption. With others, the means of sensual gratification is found\r\nout by personal action; whilst in other cases fallen and depraved men\r\nhave not hesitated to debauch the minds of mere children by teaching\r\nthem this debasing practice.\r\n\r\n4. Thousands of youths and young men have only to use the\r\nlooking-glass to see the portrait of one guilty of this loathsome sin.\r\nThe effects are plainly discernible in the boy's appearance. The\r\nface and hands become pale and bloodless. The eye is destitute of its\r\nnatural fire and lustre. The flesh is soft and flabby, the muscles\r\nlimp and lacking healthy firmness. In cases where the habit has become\r\nconfirmed, and where the system has been drained of this vital force,\r\nit is seen in positive ugliness, in a pale and cadaverous appearance,\r\nslovenly gait, slouching walk, and an impaired memory.\r\n\r\n5. It is obvious that if the most vital physical force of a boy's life\r\nis being spent through this degrading habit--a habit, be it observed,\r\nof rapid growth, great strength, and difficult to break--he must\r\ndevelop badly. In thousands of cases the result is seen in a low\r\nstature, contracted chest, weak lungs, and liability to sore throat.\r\nTendency to cold, indigestion, depression, drowsiness, and idleness,\r\nare results distinctly traceable to this deadly practice. Pallor\r\nof countenance, nervous and rheumatic affections, loss of memory,\r\nepilepsy, paralysis, and insanity find their principal predisposing\r\ncause in the same shameful waste of life. The want of moral force and\r\nstrength of mind often observable in youths and young men is largely\r\ninduced by this destructive and deadly sin.\r\n\r\n6. Large numbers of youths pass from an exhausted boyhood into the\r\nweakness, intermittent fevers, and consumption, which are said to\r\ncarry off so many. If the deaths were attributed primarily to loss\r\nof strength occasioned by self-pollution, it would be much nearer the\r\ntruth. It is monstrous to suppose that a boy who comes from healthy\r\nparents should decline and die. Without a shade of doubt the chief\r\ncause of decay and death amongst youths and young men, is to be traced\r\nto this baneful habit.\r\n\r\n7. It is a well-known fact that any man who desires to excel and\r\nretain his excellence as an accurate shot, an oarsman, a pedestrian,\r\na pugilist, a first-class cricketer, bicyclist, student, artist,\r\nor literary man, must abstain from self-pollution and fornication.\r\nThousands of school boys and students lose their positions in the\r\nclass, and are plucked at the time of their examination by reason\r\nof failure of memory, through lack of nerve and vital force, caused\r\nmainly by draining the physical frame of the seed which is the vigor\r\nof the life.\r\n\r\n8. It is only true to say that thousands of young men in the early\r\nstages of a licentious career would rather lose a right hand than have\r\ntheir mothers or sisters know what manner of men they are. From the\r\nside of the mothers and sisters it may also be affirmed that, were\r\nthey aware of the real character of those brothers and sons, they\r\nwould wish that they had never been born.\r\n\r\n9. Let it be remembered that sexual desire is not in itself\r\ndishonorable or sinful, any more than hunger, thirst, or any other\r\nlawful and natural desire is. It is the gratification by unlawful\r\nmeans of this appetite which renders it so corrupting and iniquitous.\r\n\r\n10. Leisure means the opportunity to commit sin. Unclean pictures are\r\nsought after and feasted upon, paragraphs relating to cases of\r\ndivorce and seduction are eagerly read, papers and books of an\r\nimmoral character and tendency greedily devoured, low and disgusting\r\nconversation indulged in and repeated.\r\n\r\n11. The practical and manly counsel to every youth and young man is,\r\nentire abstinence from indulgence of the sexual faculty until such\r\ntime as the marriage relationship is entered upon. Neither is there,\r\nnor can there be, any exception to this rule.\r\n\r\n12. No man can affirm that self-denial ever injured him. On the\r\ncontrary, self-restraint has been liberty, strength and blessing.\r\nBeware of the deceitful streams of temporary gratification, whose\r\neddying current drifts towards license, shame, disease and death.\r\nRemember, how quickly moral power declines, how rapidly the edge of\r\nthe fatal maelstrom is reached, how near the vortex, how terrible the\r\npenalty, how fearful the sentence of everlasting punishment.\r\n\r\n13. Be a young man of principle, honor, and preserve your powers. How\r\ncan you look an innocent girl in the face when you are degrading your\r\nmanhood with the vilest practice? Keep your mind and life pure and\r\nnobility will be your crown.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nREMEDIES FOR THE SOCIAL EVIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. MAN RESPONSIBLE.--Every great social reform must begin with the\r\nmale sex. They must either lead, or give it its support. Prostitution\r\nis a sin wholly of their own making. All the misery, all the lust, as\r\nwell as all the blighting consequences, are chargeable wholly to\r\nthe uncontrolled sexual passion of the male. To reform sinful women,\r\n_reform the men_. Teach them that the physiological truth means\r\npermanent moral, physical and mental benefit, while seductive\r\nindulgence blights and ruins.\r\n\r\n2. CONTAGIOUS DISEASES.--A man or woman cannot long live an impure\r\nlife without sooner or later contracting disease which brings to\r\nevery sufferer not only moral degradation, but often serious and vital\r\ninjuries and many times death itself becomes the only relief.\r\n\r\n3. SHOULD IT BE REGULATED BY LAW?--Dr. G.J. Ziegler, of Philadelphia,\r\nin several medical articles says that the act of sexual connection\r\nshould be made in itself the solemnization of marriage, and that when\r\nany such single act can be proven against an unmarried man, by an\r\nunmarried woman, the latter be at once invested with all the legal\r\nprivileges of a wife. By bestowing this power on women very few men\r\nwould risk the dangers of the society of a dissolute and scheming\r\nwoman who might exercise the right to force him to a marriage and ruin\r\nhis reputation and life. The strongest objection of this would be\r\nthat it would increase the temptation to destroy the purity of married\r\nwomen, for they could be approached without danger of being forced\r\ninto another marriage. But this objection could easily be harmonized\r\nwith a good system of well regulated laws. Many means have been tried\r\nto mitigate the social evils, but with little encouragement. In the\r\ncity of Paris a system of registration has been inaugurated and\r\nhouses of prostitution are under the supervision of the police, yet\r\nprostitution has not been in any degree diminished. Similar methods\r\nhave been tried in other European towns, but without satisfactory\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n4. MORAL INFLUENCE.--Let it be an imperative to every clergyman, to\r\nevery educator, to every statesman and to every philanthropist, to\r\nevery father and to every mother, to impart that moral influence which\r\nmay guide and direct the youth of the land into the natural channels\r\nof morality, chastity and health. Then, and not till then, shall\r\nwe see righteous laws and rightly enforced for the mitigation and\r\nextermination of the modern house of prostitution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TURKISH CIGARETTE GIRL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE SELFISH SLAVES OF DOSES OF DISEASE AND DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. MOST DEVILISH INTOXICATION.--What is the most devilish, subtle\r\nalluring, unconquerable, hopeless and deadly form of intoxication,\r\nwith which science struggles and to which it often succumbs; which\r\neludes the restrictive grasp of legislation; lurks behind lace\r\ncurtains, hides in luxurious boudoirs, haunts the solitude of the\r\nstudy, and with waxen face, furtive eyes and palsied step totters to\r\nthe secret recesses of its self-indulgence? It is the drunkenness\r\nof drugs, and woe be unto him that crosseth the threshold of its\r\ndream-curtained portal, for though gifted with the strength of Samson,\r\nthe courage of Richard and the genius of Archimedes, he shall never\r\nreturn, and of him it is written that forever he leaves hope behind.\r\n\r\n2. THE MATERIAL SATAN.--The material Satan in this sensuous syndicate\r\nof soul and body-destroying drugs is opium, and next in order of\r\nhellish potency come cocaine and chloral.\r\n\r\n3. GUM OPIUM.--Gum opium, from which the sulphate of morphine is made,\r\nis the dried juice of the poppy, and is obtained principally in the\r\norient. Taken in moderate doses it acts specially upon the nervous\r\nsystem, deadens sensibility, and the mind becomes inactive. When used\r\nhabitually and excessively it becomes a tonic, which stimulates the\r\nwhole nervous system, producing intense mental exaltation and delusive\r\nvisions. When the effects wear off, proportionate lassitude follows,\r\nwhich begets an insatiate and insane craving for the drug. Under the\r\nrepeated strain of the continually increasing doses, which have to be\r\ntaken to renew the desired effect, the nervous system finally becomes\r\nexhausted, and mind and body are utterly and hopelessly wrecked.\r\n\r\n4. COCAINE.--Cocaine is extracted from the leaves of the Peruvian\r\ncocoa tree, and exerts a decided influence upon the nervous system,\r\nsomewhat akin to that of coffee. It increases the heart action and\r\nis said to be such an exhilarant that the natives of the Andes are\r\nenabled to make extra-ordinary forced marches by chewing the leaves\r\ncontaining it. Its after effects are more depressing even than those\r\nof opium, and insanity more frequently results from its use.\r\n\r\n5. CHLORAL.--The name which is derived from the first two syllables\r\nof chlorine and alcohol, is made by passing dry chlorine gas in a\r\ncontinuous stream through absolute alcohol for six or eight weeks. It\r\nis a hypnotic or sleep-producing drug, and in moderate doses acts on\r\nthe caliber of the blood vessels of the brain, producing a soothing\r\neffect, especially in cases of passive congestion. Some patent\r\nmedicines contain chloral, bromide and hyoseamus, and they have a\r\nlarge sale, being bought by persons of wealth, who do not know what\r\nthey are composed of and recklessly take them for the effect they\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\n6. VICTIMS RAPIDLY INCREASING.--\"From my experience,\" said a leading\r\nand conservative druggist, \"I infer that the number of what are termed\r\nopium, cocaine, and chloral \"fiends\" is rapidly increasing, and is\r\ngreater by two or three hundred percent than a year ago, with twice\r\nas many women as men represented. I should say that one person out\r\nof every fifty is a victim of this frightful habit, which claims its\r\ndoomed votaries from the extremes of social life, those who have the\r\nmost and the least to live for, the upper classes and the cyprian,\r\nprofessional men of the finest intelligence, fifty per cent. of whom\r\nare doctors and walk into the pit with eyes wide open. And lawyers and\r\nother professional men must be added to this fated vice.\"\r\n\r\n7. DESTROYS THE MORAL FIBER.--\"It is a habit which utterly destroys\r\nthe moral fiber of its slaves, and makes unmitigated liars and thieves\r\nand forgers of them, and even murder might be added to the list of\r\ncrimes, were no other road left open to the gratification of its\r\ninsatiate and insane appetite. I do not know of a single case in which\r\nit has been mastered, but I do know of many where the end has been\r\nunspeakable misery, disgrace, suffering, insanity and death.\"\r\n\r\n8. SHAMEFUL DEATH.--To particularize further would be profitless so\r\nfar as the beginners are concerned, but would to heaven that those not\r\nwithin the shadow of this shameful death would take warning from those\r\nwho are. There are no social or periodical drunkards in this sort\r\nof intoxication. The vice is not only solitary, unsocial and utterly\r\nselfish, but incessant and increasing in its demands.\r\n\r\n9. APPETITE STRONGER THAN FOR LIQUOR.--This appetite is far stronger\r\nand more uncontrollable than that for liquor, and we can spot its\r\nvictim as readily as though he were an ordinary bummer. He has a\r\npallid complexion, a shifting, shuffling manner and can't look you\r\nin the face. If you manage to catch his eye for an instant you will\r\nobserve that its pupil is contracted to an almost invisible point. It\r\nis no exaggeration to say that he would barter his very soul for that\r\nwhich indulgence has made him too poor to purchase, and where artifice\r\nfails he will grovel in abject agony of supplication for a few grains.\r\nAt the same time he resorts to all kinds of miserable and transparent\r\nshifts, to conceal his degradation. He never buys for himself, but\r\nalways for some fictitious person, and often resorts to purchasing\r\nfrom distant points.\r\n\r\n10. OPIUM SMOKING.--\"Opium smoking,\" said another representative\r\ndruggist, \"is almost entirely confined to the Chinese and they seem to\r\nthrive on it. Very few others hit the pipe that we know of.\"\r\n\r\n11. MALT AND ALCOHOLIC DRUNKENNESS.--Alcoholic stimulants have a\r\nrecord of woe second to nothing. Its victims are annually marching\r\nto drunkards' graves by the thousands. Drunkards may be divided into\r\nthree classes: First, the accidental or social drunkard; second, the\r\nperiodical or spasmodic drunkard; and third, the sot.\r\n\r\n12. THE ACCIDENTAL OR SOCIAL DRUNKARD is yet on safe ground. He has\r\nnot acquired the dangerous craving for liquor. It is only on special\r\noccasions that he yields to excessive indulgence; sometimes in meeting\r\na friend, or at some political blow-out. On extreme occasions he will\r\nindulge until he becomes a helpless victim, and usually as he grows\r\nolder occasions will increase, and step by step he will be lead nearer\r\nto the precipice of ruin.\r\n\r\n13. THE PERIODICAL OR SPASMODIC DRUNKARD, with whom it is always\r\nthe unexpected which occurs, and who at intervals exacts from his\r\naccumulated capital the usury of as prolonged a spree as his nerves\r\nand stomach will stand. Science is inclined to charitably label this\r\nspecimen of man a sort of a physiologic puzzle, to be as much pitied\r\nas blamed. Given the benefit of every doubt, when he starts off on one\r\nof his hilarious tangents, he becomes a howling nuisance; if he has a\r\nfamily, keeps them continually on the ragged edge of apprehension, and\r\nis unanimously pronounced a \"holy terror\" by his friends. His life and\r\nfuture is an uncertainty. He is unreliable and cannot be long trusted.\r\nTotal reformation is the only hope, but it rarely is accomplished.\r\n\r\n14. THE SOT.--A blunt term that needs no defining, for even the\r\nchildren comprehend the hopeless degradation it implies. Laws to\r\nrestrain and punish him are framed; societies to protect and reform\r\nhim are organized, and mostly in vain. He is prone in life's very\r\ngutter; bloated, reeking and polluted with the doggery's slops and\r\nfilth. He can fall but a few feet lower, and not until he stumbles\r\ninto an unmarked, unhonored grave, where kind mother earth and the\r\nmerciful mantle of oblivion will cover and conceal the awful wreck he\r\nmade of God's own image. To the casual observer, the large majority of\r\nthe community, these three phases, at whose vagaries many laugh, and\r\nover whose consequences millions mourn, comprehend intoxication and\r\nits results, from the filling of the cup to its shattering fall from\r\nthe nerveless hand, and this is the end of the matter. Would to God\r\nthat it were! for at that it would be bad enough. But it is not, for\r\nwife, children and friends must suffer and drink the cup of trouble\r\nand sorrow to its dregs.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOBJECT LESSONS OF THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL AND CIGARETTE SMOKING.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy Prof. George Henkle, who personally made the post-mortem\r\nexaminations and drew the following illustrations from the diseased\r\norgans just as they appeared when first taken from the bodies of the\r\nunfortunate victims.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STOMACH of an habitual drinker of alcoholic\r\nstimulants, showing the ulcerated condition of the mucous membrane,\r\nincapacitating this important organ for digestive functions.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STOMACH (interior view) of a healthy person with\r\nthe first section of the small intestines.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LIVER of a drunkard who died of Cirrhosis of the\r\nliver, also called granular liver, or \"gin drinker's liver.\" The organ\r\nis much shrunken and presents rough, uneven edges, with carbuncular\r\nnon-suppurative sores.

A tobacconist\r\nhimself says that \"the extent to which drugs are used in cigarettes\r\nis appalling.\" \"Havana flavoring\" for this same purpose is sold\r\neverywhere by the thousand barrels. This flavoring is made from the\r\ntonka-bean, which contains a deadly poison. The wrappers, warranted\r\nto be rice paper, are sometimes made of common paper, and sometimes of\r\nthe filthy scrapings of ragpickers bleached white with arsenic. What a\r\nthing for human lungs.\r\n\r\nThe habit burns up good health, good resolutions, good manners, good\r\nmemories, good faculties, and often honesty and truthfulness as well.\r\n\r\nCases of epilepsy, insanity and death are frequently reported as\r\nthe result of smoking cigarettes, while such physicians as Dr. Lewis\r\nSayre, Dr. Hammond, and Sir Morell Mackenzie of England, name heart\r\ntrouble, blindness, cancer and other diseases as occasioned by it.\r\n\r\nLeading physicians of America unanimously condemn cigarette smoking\r\nas \"one of the vilest and most destructive evils that ever befell\r\nthe youth of any country,\" declaring that \"its direct tendency is a\r\ndeterioration of the race.\"\r\n\r\nLook at the pale, wilted complexion of a boy who indulges to excessive\r\ncigarette smoking. It takes no physician to diagnose his case, and\r\ndeath will surely mark for his own every boy and young man who will\r\nfollow up the habit. It is no longer a matter of guess. It is a\r\nscientific fact which the microscope in every case verifies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Illustrating the shrunken condition of one of the\r\nLungs of an excessive smoker_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INNOCENT YOUTH.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Dangerous Vices.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew persons are aware of the extent to which masturbation or\r\nself-pollution is practiced by the young of both sexes in civilized\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.\r\n\r\nThe hollow, sunken eye, the blanched cheek, the withered hands, and\r\nemaciated frame, and the listless life, have other sources than the\r\nordinary illnesses of all large communities.\r\n\r\nWhen a child, after having given proofs of memory and intelligence,\r\nexperiences daily more and more difficulty in retaining and\r\nunderstanding what is taught him, it is not only from unwillingness\r\nand idleness, as is commonly supposed, but from a disease eating out\r\nlife itself, brought on by a self-abuse of the private organs.\r\nBesides the slow and progressive derangement of his or her health, the\r\ndiminished energy of application, the languid movement, the stooping\r\ngait, the desertion of social games, the solitary walk, late rising,\r\nlivid and sunken eye, and many other symptoms, will fix the attention\r\nof every intelligent and competent guardian of youth that something is\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GUARD WELL THE CRADLE. EDUCATION CANNOT BEGIN TOO\r\nYOUNG.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMARRIED PEOPLE.\r\n\r\nNor are many persons sufficiently aware of the ruinous extent to which\r\nthe amative propensity is indulged by married persons. The matrimonial\r\nceremony does, indeed, sanctify the act of sexual intercourse, but it\r\ncan by no means atone for nor obviate the consequences of its abuse.\r\nExcessive indulgence in the married relation is, perhaps, as much\r\nowing to the force of habit, as to the force of the sexual appetite.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTREME YOUTH.\r\n\r\nMore lamentable still is the effect of inordinate sexual excitement of\r\nthe young and unmarried. It is not very uncommon to find a confirmed\r\nonanist, or, rather, masturbator, who has not yet arrived at the\r\nperiod of puberty. Many cases are related in which young boys and\r\ngirls, from eight to ten years of age, were taught the method\r\nof self-pollution by their older playmates, and had made serious\r\nencroachments on the fund of constitutional vitality even before any\r\nconsiderable degree of sexual appetite was developed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORCE OF HABIT.\r\n\r\nHere, again, the fault was not in the power of passion, but in the\r\nforce of habit. Parents and guardians of youth can not be too mindful\r\nof the character and habits of those with whom they allow young\r\npersons and children under their charge to associate intimately, and\r\nespecially careful should they be with whom they allow them to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIN OF IGNORANCE.\r\n\r\nIt is customary to designate self-pollution as among the \"vices.\" I\r\nthink misfortune is the more appropriate term. It is true, that in the\r\nphysiological sense, it is one of the very worst \"transgressions of\r\nthe law.\" But in the moral sense it is generally the sin of ignorance\r\nin the commencement, and in the end the passive submission to a morbid\r\nand almost resistless impulse.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUACKS.\r\n\r\nThe time has come when the rising generation must be thoroughly\r\ninstructed in this matter. That quack specific \"ignorance\" has been\r\nexperimented with quite too long already. The true method of insuring\r\nall persons, young or old, against the abuses of any part, organ,\r\nfunction, or faculty of the wondrous machinery of life, is to teach\r\nthem its use. \"Train a child in the way it should go\" or be sure it\r\nwill, amid the ten thousand surrounding temptations, find out a way\r\nin which it should not go. Keeping a child in ignorant innocence is, I\r\naver, no part of the \"training\" which has been taught by a wiser\r\nthan Solomon. Boys and girls do know, will know, and must know, that\r\nbetween them are important anatomical differences and interesting\r\nphysiological relations. Teach them, I repeat, their use, or expect\r\ntheir abuse. Hardly a young person in the world would ever become\r\naddicted to self-pollution if he or she understood clearly the\r\nconsequences; if he or she knew at the outset that the practice was\r\ndirectly destroying the bodily stamina, vitiating the moral tone, and\r\nenfeebling the intellect. No one would pursue the disgusting habit if\r\nhe or she was fully aware that it was blasting all prospects of health\r\nand happiness in the approaching period of manhood and womanhood.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL SYMPTOMS OF THE SECRET HABIT.\r\n\r\nThe effects of either self-pollution or excessive sexual indulgence,\r\nappear in many forms. It would seem as if God had written an\r\ninstinctive law of remonstrance, in the innate moral sense, against\r\nthis filthy vice.\r\n\r\nAll who give themselves up to the excesses of this debasing\r\nindulgence, carry about with them, continually, a consciousness of\r\ntheir defilement, and cherish a secret suspicion that others look upon\r\nthem as debased beings. They feel none of that manly confidence\r\nand gallant spirit, and chaste delight in the presence of virtuous\r\nfemales, which stimulate young men to pursue the course of ennobling\r\nrefinement, and mature them for the social relations and enjoyments of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThis shamefacedness, or unhappy quailing of the countenance, on\r\nmeeting the look of others, often follows them through life, in some\r\ninstances even after they have entirely abandoned the habit, and\r\nbecame married men and respectable members of society.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, the only complaint the patient will make on consulting\r\nyou, is that he is suffering under a kind of continued fever. He\r\nwill probably present a hot, dry skin, with something of a hectic\r\nappearance. Though all the ordinary means of arresting such symptoms\r\nhave been tried, he is none the better.\r\n\r\nThe sleep seems to be irregular and unrefreshing--restlessness\r\nduring the early part of the night, and in the advanced stages of\r\nthe disease, profuse sweats before morning. There is also frequent\r\nstarting in the sleep, from disturbing dreams. The characteristic\r\nfeature is, that your patient almost always dreams of sexual\r\nintercourse. This is one of the earliest, as well as most constant\r\nsymptoms. When it occurs most frequently, it is apt to be accompanied\r\nwith pain. A gleety discharge from the urethra may also be frequently\r\ndiscovered, especially if the patient examine when at stool or after\r\nurinating. Other common symptoms are nervous headache, giddiness,\r\nringing in the ears, and a dull pain in the back part of the head.\r\nIt is frequently the case that the patient suffers a stiffness in the\r\nneck, darting pains in the forehead, and also weak eyes are among the\r\ncommon symptoms.\r\n\r\nOne very frequent, and perhaps early symptom (especially in young\r\nfemales) is solitariness--a disposition to seclude themselves from\r\nsociety. Although they may be tolerably cheerful when in company, they\r\nprefer rather to be alone.\r\n\r\nThe countenance has often a gloomy and worn-down expression. The\r\npatient's friends frequently notice a great change. Large livid spots\r\nunder the eyes is a common feature. Sudden flashes of heat may\r\nbe noticed passing over the patient's face. He is liable also to\r\npalpitations. The pulse is very variable, generally too slow. Extreme\r\nemaciation, without any other assignable cause for it, may be set down\r\nas another very common symptom.\r\n\r\nIf the evil has gone on for several years, there will be a general\r\nunhealthy appearance, of a character so marked as to enable an\r\nexperienced observer at once to detect the cause. In the case of\r\nonanists especially there is a peculiar rank odor emitted from\r\nthe body, by which they may be readily distinguished. One striking\r\npeculiarity of all these patients is, that they cannot look a man in\r\nthe face! Cowardice is constitutional with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT OF THE SECRET HABIT.\r\n\r\n1. The first condition of recovery is a prompt and permanent\r\nabandonment of the ruinous habit. Without a faithful adherence to this\r\nprohibitory law on the part of the patient all medication on the\r\npart of the physician will assuredly fail. The patient must plainly\r\nunderstand that future prospects, character, health, and life itself,\r\ndepend on an unfaltering resistance to the morbid solicitation;\r\nwith the assurance, however, that a due perseverance will eventually\r\nrender, what now seems like a resistless and overwhelming propensity,\r\nnot only controllable but perfectly loathsome and undesirable.\r\n\r\n2. Keep the mind employed by interesting the patient in the various\r\ntopics of the day, and social features of the community.\r\n\r\n3. Plenty of bodily out of door exercise, hoeing in the garden,\r\nwalking, or working on the farm; of course not too heavy work must be\r\nindulged in.\r\n\r\n4. If the patient is weak and very much emaciated, cod liver oil is an\r\nexcellent remedy.\r\n\r\n5. DIET. The patient should live principally on brown bread, oat meal,\r\ngraham crackers, wheat meal, cracked or boiled wheat, or hominy, and\r\nfood of that character. No meats should be indulged in whatever; milk\r\ndiet if used by the patient is an excellent remedy. Plenty of fruit\r\nshould be indulged in; dried toast and baked apples make an excellent\r\nsupper. The patient should eat early in the evening, never late at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n6. Avoid all tea, coffee, or alcoholic stimulants of any kind.\r\n\r\n7. \"Early to bed and early to rise,\" should be the motto of every\r\nvictim of this vice. A patient should take a cold bath every morning\r\nafter rising. A cold water injection in moderate quantities before\r\nretiring has cured many patients.\r\n\r\n8. If the above remedies are not sufficient, a family physician should\r\nbe consulted.\r\n\r\n9. Never let children sleep together, if possible, to avoid it.\r\nDiscourage the children of neighbors and friends from sleeping with\r\nyour children.\r\n\r\n10. Have your children rise early. It is the lying in bed in the\r\nmorning that plays the mischief.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Healthy Semen, Greatly Magnified.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Semen of a Victim of Masturbation.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOCTURNAL EMISSIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nInvoluntary emissions of semen during amorous dreams at night is not\r\nat all uncommon among healthy men. When this occurs from one to three\r\nor four times a month, no anxiety or concern need be felt.\r\n\r\nWhen the emissions take place without dreams, manifested only by\r\nstained spots in the morning on the linen, or take place at stool and\r\nare entirely beyond control, then the patient should at once seek\r\nfor remedies or consult a competent physician. When blood stains are\r\nproduced, then medical aid must be sought at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT FOR NOCTURNAL EMISSIONS.\r\n\r\nSleep in a hard bed, and rise early and take a sponge bath in cold\r\nwater every morning. Eat light suppers and refrain from eating late in\r\nthe evening. Empty the bladder thoroughly before retiring, bathe the\r\nspine and hips with a sponge dipped in cold water.\r\n\r\n_Never sleep lying on the back._\r\n\r\nAvoid all highly seasoned food and read good books, and keep the mind\r\nwell employed. Take regular and vigorous outdoor exercise every day.\r\n\r\nAvoid all coffee, tea, wine, beer and all alcoholic liquors. Don't use\r\ntobacco, and keep the bowels free.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Healthy Testicle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Testicle wasted by Masturbation.]\r\n\r\nPRESCRIPTION.--Ask your druggist to put you up a good Iron Tonic and\r\ntake it regularly according to his directions.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEWARE OF ADVERTISING QUACKS.\r\n\r\nBeware of these advertising schemes that advertise a speedy cure for\r\n\"Loss of Youth,\" \"Lost Vitality,\" \"A Cure for Impotency,\" \"Renewing of\r\nOld Age,\" etc. Do not allow these circulating pamphlets and circulars\r\nto concern you the least. If you have a few _Nocturnal Emissions_,\r\nremember it is only a mark of vitality and health, and not a sign of a\r\ndeathly disease, as many of these advertising quacks would lead you to\r\nbelieve.\r\n\r\nUse your private organs only for what your Creator intended they\r\nshould be used, and there will be no occasion for you to be frightened\r\nby the deception of quacks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TWO PATHS--What Will The Boy Become?\r\n\r\nAt 15: STUDY & CLEANLINESS\r\nAt 25: PURITY & ECONOMY\r\nAt 36: HONORABLE SUCCESS\r\nAt 60: VENERABLE OLD AGE\r\n\r\nAt 15: CIGARETTES & SELF-ABUSE\r\nAt 25: IMPURITY & DISSIPATION\r\nAt 36: VICE & DEGENERACY\r\nAt 60: MORAL-PHYSICAL WRECK]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLOST MANHOOD RESTORED.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. RESOLUTE DESISTENCE.--The first step towards the restoration of\r\nlost manhood is a resolute desistence from these terrible sins. Each\r\ntime the temptation is overcome, the power to resist becomes stronger,\r\nand the fierce fire declines. Each time the sin is committed,\r\nits hateful power strengthens, and the fire of lust is increased.\r\nRemember, that you cannot commit these sins, and maintain health and\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n2. AVOID BEING ALONE.--Avoid being alone when the temptation comes\r\nupon you to commit self-abuse. Change your thoughts at once; \"keep the\r\nheart diligently, for out of it are the issues of life.\"\r\n\r\n3. AVOID EVIL COMPANIONS.--Avoid evil companions, lewd conversation,\r\nbad pictures, corrupt and vicious novels, books, and papers. Abstain\r\nfrom all intoxicating drinks. These inflame the blood, excite the\r\npassions, and stimulate sensuality; weakening the power of the brain,\r\nthey always impair the power of self-restraint. Smoking is very\r\nundesirable. Keep away from the moral pesthouses. Remember that these\r\nhouses are the great resort of fallen and depraved men and women.\r\nThe music, singing, and dancing are simply a blind to cover the\r\nintemperance and lust, which hold high carnival in these guilded\r\nhells. This, be it remembered, is equally true of the great majority\r\nof the theatres.\r\n\r\n4. AVOID STRONG TEA, OR COFFEE.--Take freely of cocoa, milk, and bread\r\nand milk, or oatmeal porridge. Meats, such as beef and mutton, use\r\nmoderately. We would strongly recommend to young men of full habit,\r\nvegetarian diet. Fruits in their season, partake liberally; also fresh\r\nvegetables. Brown bread and toast, as also rice, and similar puddings,\r\nare always suitable. Avoid rich pastry and new bread.\r\n\r\n5. THREE MEALS A DAY ARE ABUNDANT.--Avoid suppers, and be careful,\r\nif troubled with nightly emissions, not to take any liquid, not\r\neven water, after seven o'clock in the evening, at latest. This will\r\ndiminish the secretions of the body, when asleep, and the consequent\r\nemissions, which in the early hours of the morning usually follow\r\nthe taking of any kind of drink. Do not be anxious or troubled by an\r\noccasional emission, say, for example, once a fortnight.\r\n\r\n6. REST ON A HARD MATTRESS.--Keep the body cool when asleep; heat\r\narising from a load of bed-clothes, is most undesirable. Turn down the\r\ncounterpane, and let the air have free course through the blankets.\r\n\r\n7. RELIEVE THE SYSTEM.--As much as possible relieve the system of\r\nurine before going to sleep. On rising, bathe if practicable. If you\r\ncannot bear cold water, take the least possible chill off the water\r\n(cold water, however, is best). If bathing is not practicable, wash\r\nthe body with cold water, and keep scrupulously clean. The reaction\r\ncaused by cold water, is most desirable. Rub the body dry with a rough\r\ntowel. Drink a good draught of cold water.\r\n\r\n8. EXERCISE.--Get fifteen minutes' brisk walk, if possible before\r\nbreakfast. If any sense of faintness exists, eat a crust of bread, or\r\nbiscuit. Be regular in your meals, and do not fear to make a hearty\r\nbreakfast. This lays a good foundation for the day. Take daily good,\r\nbut not violent exercise. Walk until you can distinctly feel the\r\ntendency to perspiration. This will keep the pores of the skin open\r\nand in healthy condition.\r\n\r\n9. MEDICINES.--Take the medicines, if used, regularly and carefully.\r\nBromide of Potassium is a most valuable remedy in allaying lustful\r\nand heated passions and appetites. Unless there is actual venereal\r\ndisease, medicine should be very little resorted to.\r\n\r\n10. AVOID THE STREETS AT NIGHT.--Beware of corrupt companions. Fast\r\nyoung men and women should be shunned everywhere. Cultivate a taste\r\nfor good reading and evening studies. Home life with its gentle\r\nrestraints, pure friendships, and healthful discipline, should be\r\nhighly valued. There is no liberty like that of a well-regulated\r\nhome. To large numbers of young men in business houses, home life is\r\nimpracticable.\r\n\r\n11. BE OF GOOD CHEER AND COURAGE.--Recovery will be gradual, and not\r\nsudden; vital force is developed slowly from within. The object\r\naimed at by medicine and counsel, is to aid and increase nervous and\r\nphysical vigor, and give tone to the demoralized system. Do not pay\r\nthe slightest heed to the exaggerated statements of the wretched\r\nquack doctors, who advertise everywhere. Avoid them as you would a\r\npestilence. Their great object is, through exciting your fears, to get\r\nyou into their clutches, in order to oppress you with heavy and unjust\r\npayments. Be careful, not to indulge in fancies, or morbid thoughts\r\nand feelings. Be hopeful, and play the part of a man determined to\r\novercome.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMANHOOD WRECKED AND RESCUED.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE NOBLEST FUNCTIONS OF MANHOOD.--The noblest functions of manhood\r\nare brought into action in the office of the parent. It is here\r\nthat man assumes the prerogative of a God and becomes a creator.\r\nHow essential that every function of his physical system should be\r\nperfect, and every faculty of his mind free from that which would\r\ndegrade; yet how many drag their purity through the filth of\r\nmasturbation, revel in the orgies of the debauchee, and worship at\r\nthe shrine of the prostitute, until, like a tree blighted by the livid\r\nlightning, they stand with all their outward form of men, but without\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n2. THRESHOLD OF HONOR.--Think of a man like that; in whom the passions\r\nand vices have burned themselves out, putting on the airs of a saint\r\nand claiming to have reformed. Aye, reformed, when there is no\r\nlonger sweetness in the indulgence of lust. Think of such loathsome\r\nbestiality, dragging its slimy body across the threshold of honor and\r\nnobility and asking a pure woman, with the love-light of heaven in\r\nher eyes, to pass her days with him; to accept him as her lord; to\r\nbe satisfied with the burnt-out, shriveled forces of manhood left;\r\nto sacrifice her purity that he may be redeemed, and to respect in a\r\nhusband what she would despise in the brute.\r\n\r\n3. STOP.--If you are, then, on the highway to this state of\r\ndegradation, stop. If already you have sounded the depths of lost\r\nmanhood, then turn, and from the fountain of life regain your power,\r\nbefore you perpetrate the terrible crime of marriage, thus wrecking\r\na woman's life and perhaps bringing into the world children who will\r\nlive only to suffer and curse the day on which they were born and the\r\nfather who begat them.\r\n\r\n4. SEXUAL IMPOTENCY.--Sexual impotency means sexual starvation, and\r\ndrives many wives to ruin, while a similar lack among wives drives\r\nhusbands to libertinism. Nothing so enhances the happiness of married\r\ncouples as this full, life-abounding, sexual vigor in the husband,\r\nthoroughly reciprocated by the wife, yet completely controlled by\r\nboth.\r\n\r\n5. TWO CLASSES OF SUFFERERS.--There are two classes of sufferers.\r\nFirst, those who have only practiced self-abuse and are suffering from\r\nemissions. Second, those who by overindulgence in marital relations,\r\nor by dissipation with women, have ruined their forces.\r\n\r\n6. THE REMEDY.--For self-abuse: When the young man has practiced\r\nself-abuse for some time, he finds, upon quitting the habit, that he\r\nhas nightly emissions. He becomes alarmed, reads every sensational\r\nadvertisement in the papers, and at once comes to the conclusion that\r\nhe must take something. _Drugs are not necessary._\r\n\r\n7. STOP THE CAUSE.--The one thing needful, above all others, is to\r\nstop the cause. I have found that young men are invariably mistaken\r\nas to what is the cause. When asked as to the first cause of their\r\ntrouble, they invariably say it was self-abuse, etc., but it is not.\r\n_It is the thought._ This precedes the handling, and, like every other\r\ncause, must be removed in order to have right results.\r\n\r\n8. STOP THE THOUGHT.--But remember, _stop the thought_! You must not\r\nlook after every woman with lustful thoughts, nor go courting girls\r\nwho will allow you to hug, caress and kiss them, thus rousing your\r\npassions almost to a climax. Do not keep the company of those whose\r\nonly conversation is of a lewd and depraved character, but keep the\r\ncompany of those ladies who awaken your higher sentiments and nobler\r\nimpulses, who appeal to the intellect and rouse your aspiration, in\r\nwhose presence you would no more feel your passions aroused than in\r\nthe presence of your own mother.\r\n\r\n9. YOU WILL GET WELL.--Remember you will get well. Don't fear. Fear\r\ndestroys strength and therefore increases the trouble. Many get\r\ndownhearted, discouraged, despairing--the very worst thing that can\r\nhappen, doing as much harm, and in many cases more, than their former\r\ndissipation. Brooding kills; hope enlivens. Then sing with joy that\r\nthe savior of knowledge has vanquished the death-dealing ignorance of\r\nthe past; that the glorious strength of manhood has awakened and cast\r\nfrom you forever the grinning skeleton of vice. Be your better self,\r\nproud that your thoughts in the day-time are as pure as you could wish\r\nyour dreams to be at night.\r\n\r\n10. HELPS.--Do not use tobacco or liquor. They inflame the passions\r\nand irritate the nervous system; they only gratify base appetites\r\nand never rouse the higher feelings. Highly spiced food should be\r\neschewed, not chewed. Meat should be eaten sparingly, and never at the\r\nlast meal.\r\n\r\n11. DON'T EAT TOO MUCH.--If not engaged in hard physical labor, try\r\neating two meals a day. Never neglect the calls of nature, and if\r\npossible have a passage from the bowels every night before retiring.\r\nWhen this is not done the feces often drop into the rectum during\r\nsleep, producing heat which extends to the sexual organs, causing the\r\nlascivious dreams and emission. This will be noticed especially in\r\nthe morning, when the feces usually distend the rectum and the person\r\nnearly always awakes with sexual passions aroused. If necessary, use\r\ninjections into the rectum of from one to two quarts of water, blood\r\nheat, two or three times a week. Be sure to keep clean and see to it\r\nthat no matter collects under the foreskin. Wash off the organ every\r\nnight and take a quick, cold hand-bath every morning. Have something\r\nto do. Never be idle. Idleness always worships at the shrine of\r\npassion.\r\n\r\n12. THE WORST TIME OF ALL.--Many are ruined by allowing their thoughts\r\nto run riot in the morning. Owing to the passions being roused as\r\nstated above, the young man lies half awake and half dozing, rousing\r\nhis passions and reveling in lascivious thought for hours perhaps,\r\nthus completely sapping the fountains of purity, establishing habits\r\nof vice that will bind him with iron bands, and doing his physical\r\nsystem more injury than if he had practiced self-abuse, and had the\r\nemission in a few minutes. Jump out of bed at once on waking, and\r\nnever allow the thought to master you.\r\n\r\n13. A HAND BATH.--A hand bath in cold water every morning will\r\ndiminish those rampant sexual cravings, that crazy, burning, lustful\r\ndesire so sensualizing to men by millions; lessen prostitution by\r\ntoning down that passion which alone patronizes it, and relieve wives\r\nby the millions of those excessive conjugal demands which ruin their\r\nsexual health; besides souring their tempers, and then demanding\r\nmillions of money for resultant doctor bills.\r\n\r\n14. WILL GET WELL.--Feel no more concern about yourself. Say to\r\nyourself, \"I shall and will get well under this treatment,\" as you\r\ncertainly will. Pluck is half the battle. Mind acts and reads directly\r\non the sexual organs. Determining to get well gets you well; whilst\r\nall fear that you will become worse makes you worse. All worrying over\r\nyour case as if it were hopeless, all moody and despondent feelings,\r\ntear the life right out of these organs, whilst hopefulness puts new\r\nlife into them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INNOCENT CHILDHOOD.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE CURSE AND CONSEQUENCE OF SECRET DISEASES.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE SINS OF THE FATHERS ARE VISITED ON THE CHILDREN.--If persons\r\nwho contract secret diseases were the only sufferers, there would\r\nbe less pity and less concern manifested by the public and medical\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n2. There are many secret diseases which leave an hereditary taint, and\r\ninnocent children and grandchildren are compelled to suffer as well as\r\nthose who committed the immoral act.\r\n\r\n3. GONORRHOEA (Clap) is liable to leave the parts sensitive and\r\nirritable, and the miseries of spermatorrhoea, impotence, chronic\r\nrheumatism, stricture and other serious ailments may follow.\r\n\r\n4. SYPHILIS (Pox).--Statistics prove that over 30 per cent. of the\r\nchildren born alive perish within the first year. Outside of this\r\nfrightful mortality, how many children are born, inheriting eruptions\r\nof the skin, foul ulcerations swelling of the bones, weak eyes or\r\nblindness, scrofula, idiocy, stunted growth, and finally insanity, all\r\non account of the father's early vices. The weaknesses and afflictions\r\nof parents are by natural laws visited upon their children.\r\n\r\n5. The mother often takes the disease from her husband, and she\r\nbecomes an innocent sufferer to the dreaded disease. However, some\r\nother name generally is applied to the disease, and with perfect\r\nconfidence in her husband she suffers pain all her life, ignorant of\r\nthe true cause. Her children have diseases of the eyes, skin, glands\r\nand bones, and the doctor will apply the term scrofula, when the\r\nresult is nothing more or less than inherited syphilis. Let every man\r\nremember, the vengeance to a vital law knows only justice, not mercy,\r\nand a single moment of illicit pleasure will bring many curses upon\r\nhim, and drain out the life of his innocent children, and bring a\r\ndouble burden of disease and sorrow to his wife.\r\n\r\n6. If any man who has been once diseased is determined to marry, he\r\nshould have his constitution tested thoroughly and see that every seed\r\nof the malady in the system has been destroyed. He should bathe\r\ndaily in natural sulphur waters, as, for instance, the hot springs in\r\nArkansas, or the sulphur springs in Florida, or those springs known as\r\nspecific remedies for syphilic diseases. As long as the eruptions on\r\nthe skin appear by bathing in sulphur water there is danger, and if\r\nthe eruptions cease and do not appear, it is very fair evidence that\r\nthe disease has left the system, yet it is not an infallible test.\r\n\r\n7. How many bright and intelligent young men have met their doom and\r\nblighted the innocent lives of others, all on account of the secret\r\nfollies and vices of men.\r\n\r\n8. PROTECTION.--Girls, you, who are too poor and too honest to\r\ndisguise aught in your character, with your sweet soul shining through\r\nevery act of your lives, beware of the men who smile upon you. Study\r\nhuman nature, and try and select a virtuous companion.\r\n\r\n10. SYPHILITIC POISON INERADICABLE.--Many of our best and ablest\r\nphysicians assert that syphilitic poison, once infected, there can be\r\nno total disinfection during life; some of the virus remains in\r\nthe system, though it may seem latent. Boards of State Charities in\r\ndiscussing the causes of the existence of whole classes of defectives\r\nhold to the opinion given above. The Massachusetts board in its report\r\nhas these strong words on the subject:\r\n\r\n\"The worst is that, though years may have passed since its active\r\nstage, it permeates the very seed of life and causes strange\r\naffections or abnormalities in the offspring, or it tends to lessen\r\ntheir vital force, to disturb or to repress their growth, to lower\r\ntheir standard of mental and bodily vigor, and to render life puny and\r\nshort.\"\r\n\r\n11. A SERPENT'S TOOTH.--\"_The direct blood-poisoning, caused by the\r\nabsorption into the system of the virus (syphilis) is more hideous and\r\nterrible in its effect than that of a serpent's tooth._ This may kill\r\noutright, and there's an end; but that, stingless and painless, slowly\r\nand surely permeates and vitiates the whole system of which it becomes\r\npart and parcel, like myriads of trichinae, and can never be utterly\r\ncast out, even by salivation.\r\n\r\n\"Woe to the family and to the people in whose veins the poison\r\ncourses!\r\n\r\n\"It would seem that nothing could end the curse except utter\r\nextermination. That, however, would imply a purpose of eternal\r\nvengeance, involving the innocent with the guilty.\"\r\n\r\nThis disease compared with small-pox is as an ulcer upon a finger\r\nto an ulcer in the vitals. Small-pox does not vitiate the blood of\r\na people; this disease does. Its existence in a primary form implies\r\nmoral turpitude.\r\n\r\n12. CASES CITED.--Many cases might be cited. We give but one. A man\r\nwho had contracted the disease reformed his ways and was apparently\r\ncured. He married, and although living a moral life was compelled to\r\nwitness in his little girl's eye-balls, her gums, and her breath the\r\nresult of his past sins. No suffering, no expense, no effort would\r\nhave been too great could he but be assured that his offspring might\r\nbe freed from these results.\r\n\r\n13. PREVENTION BETTER THAN CURE.--Here is a case where the old adage,\r\n\"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,\" may be aptly\r\napplied. Our desire would be to herald to all young men in stentorian\r\ntones the advice, \"Avoid as a deadly enemy any approaches or probable\r\npitfalls of the disease. Let prevention be your motto and then you\r\nneed not look for a cure.\"\r\n\r\n14. HELP PROFFERED.--Realizing the sad fact that many are afflicted\r\nwith this disease we would put forth our utmost powers to help even\r\nthese, and hence give on the following pages some of the best methods\r\nof cure.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO CURE GONORRHOEA (Clap).\r\n\r\nCAUSES, IMPURE CONNECTIONS, ETC.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--As the disease first commences to manifest itself, the\r\npatient notices a slight itching at the point of the male organ, which\r\nis shortly followed by a tingling or smarting sensation, especially\r\non making water. This is on account of the inflammation, which now\r\ngradually extends backward, until the whole canal is involved. The\r\norifice of the urethra is now noticed to be swollen and reddened, and\r\non inspection a slight discharge will be found to be present. And\r\nif the penis is pressed between the finger and thumb, matter or pus\r\nexudes. As the inflammatory stage commences, the formation of pus\r\nis increased, which changes from a thin to a thick yellow color,\r\naccompanied by a severe scalding on making water. The inflammation\r\nincreases up to the fifth day, often causing such pain, on urinating,\r\nthat the patient is tortured severely. When the disease reaches its\r\nheight, the erections become somewhat painful, when the discharge may\r\nbe streaked with blood.\r\n\r\nHOME TREATMENT.\r\n\r\nFirst, see that the bowels are loose--if not, a cathartic should be\r\ngiven. If the digestive powers are impaired, they should be corrected\r\nand the general health looked after. If the system is in a good\r\ncondition, give internally five drops of gelseminum every two hours.\r\nThe first thing to be thought of is to pluck the disease in its\r\nbud, which is best done by injections. The best of these are: tinct.\r\nhydrastis, one drachm; pure water, four ounces; to be used three times\r\na day after urinating. Zinc, sulphate, ten grains; pure water, eight\r\nounces; to be used after urinating every morning and night. Equal\r\nparts of red wine and pure water are often used, and are of high\r\nrepute, as also one grain of permanganate of potash to four ounces of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIf the above remedies are ineffectual, a competent physician should be\r\nconsulted.\r\n\r\nGENERAL TREATMENT.--One of the best injections for a speedy cure is:\r\n\r\n  Hydrastis, 1 oz.\r\n  Water, 5 oz.\r\n\r\nMix and with a small syringe inject into the penis four or five times\r\na day after urinating, until relieved, and diminish the number of\r\ninjections as the disease disappears. No medicine per mouth need be\r\ngiven, unless the patient is in poor health.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYPHILIS (POX).\r\n\r\n1. This is the worst of all diseases except cancer--no tissue of\r\nthe body escapes the ravages of this dreadful disease--bone, muscle,\r\nteeth, skin and every part of the body are destroyed by its deforming\r\nand corroding influence.\r\n\r\n2. SYMPTOMS.--About eight days after the exposure a little redness and\r\nthen a pimple, which soon becomes an open sore, makes its appearance,\r\non or about the end of the penis in males or on the external or inner\r\nparts of the uterus of females. Pimples and sores soon multiply, and\r\nafter a time little hard lumps appear in the groin, which soon develop\r\ninto a blue tumor called _bubo._ Copper colored spots may appear in\r\nthe face, hair fall out, etc. Canker and ulcerations in the mouth and\r\nvarious parts of the body soon develop.\r\n\r\n3. TREATMENT.--Secure the very best physician your means will allow\r\nwithout delay.\r\n\r\n4. LOCAL TREATMENT OF BUBOES.--To prevent suppuration, treatment must\r\nbe instituted as soon as they appear. Compresses, wet in a solution\r\ncomposed of half an ounce of muriate of ammonia, three drachms of the\r\nfluid extract of belladonna, and a pint of water, are beneficial, and\r\nshould be continuously applied. The tumor may be scattered by painting\r\nit once a day with tincture of iodine.\r\n\r\n5. FOR ERUPTIONS.--The treatment of these should be mainly\r\nconstitutional. Perfect cleanliness should be observed, and the\r\nsulphur, spirit vapor, or alkaline bath freely used. Good diet and\r\nthe persistent use of alteratives will generally prove successful in\r\nremoving this complication.\r\n\r\nRECIPE FOR SYPHILIS.\r\n  Bin-iodide of mercury, 1 gr.\r\n  Extract of licorice, 32 gr.\r\n\r\nMake into 16 pills. Take one morning and night.\r\n\r\n_LOTION._\r\n  Bichloride of mercury, 15 gr.\r\n  Lime water, 1 pt.\r\n\r\nShake well, and wash affected parts night and morning.\r\n\r\nFOR ERUPTIONS ON TONGUE.\r\n  Cyanide of silver, 1/2 gr.\r\n  Powdered iridis, 2 gr.\r\n\r\nDivide into 10 parts. To be rubbed on tongue once a day.\r\n\r\nFOR ERUPTIONS IN SYPHILIS.\r\n  A 5 per cent. ointment of carbolic acid, in a good preparation.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUBO.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.\r\n  Warm poultice of linseed meal,\r\n  Mercurial plaster,\r\n  Lead ointment.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLEET (CHRONIC CLAP).\r\n\r\n1. SYMPTOMS.--When gonorrhoea is not cured at the end of twenty-one or\r\ntwenty-eight days, at which time all discharge should have ceased, we\r\nhave a condition known as chronic clap, which is nothing more or less\r\nthan gleet. At this time most of the symptoms have abated, and the\r\nprincipal one needing medical attention is the discharge, which is\r\ngenerally thin, and often only noticed in the morning on arising, when\r\na scab will be noticed, glutinating the lips of the external orifice.\r\nOr, on pressing with the thumb and finger from behind, forward, a\r\nthin, white discharge can be noticed.\r\n\r\n2. HOME TREATMENT.--The diet of patients affected with this disease\r\nis all-important, and should have careful attention. The things that\r\nshould be avoided are highly spiced and stimulating foods and drinks,\r\nas all forms of alcohol, or those containing acids. Indulgence in\r\nimpure thoughts is often sufficient to keep a discharge, on account\r\nof the excitement it produces to the sensitive organs, thus inducing\r\nerections, which always do harm.\r\n\r\n3. GENERAL TREATMENT.--The best injection is:\r\n  Nitrate of silver, 1/4 grain\r\n  Pure water, 1 oz.\r\n  Inject three or four times a day after urinating.\r\n\r\nSTRICTURE OF THE URETHRA.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--The patient experiences difficulty in voiding the urine,\r\nseveral ineffectual efforts being made before it will flow. The stream\r\nis diminished in size, of a flattened or spiral form, or divided in\r\ntwo or more parts, and does not flow with the usual force.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--It is purely a surgical case and a competent surgeon must\r\nbe consulted.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHIMOSIS.\r\n\r\n1. CAUSE.--Is a morbid condition of the penis, in which the glans\r\npenis cannot be uncovered, either on account of a congenital smallness\r\nof the orifice of the foreskin, or it may be due to the acute stage of\r\ngonorrhoea, or caused by the presence of soft chancre.\r\n\r\n2. SYMPTOMS.--It is hardly necessary to give a description of the\r\nsymptoms occurring in this condition, for it will be easily diagnosed,\r\nand its appearances are so indicative that all that is necessary is to\r\nstudy into its cause and treat the disease with reference to that.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--If caused from acute gonorrhoea, it should be treated\r\nfirst by hot fomentations, to subdue the swelling, when the glans\r\npenis can be uncovered. If the result of the formation of chancre\r\nunder the skin, they should be treated by a surgeon, for it may result\r\nin the sloughing off of the end of the penis, unless properly treated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ILLUSTRATING MAGNETIC INFLUENCES. ANIMAL MAGNETISM IS\r\nSUPPOSED TO RADIATE FROM AND ENCIRCLE EVERY HUMAN BEING.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nANIMAL MAGNETISM.\r\n\r\nWHAT IT IS AND HOW TO USE IT.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. MAGNETISM EXISTING BETWEEN THE BODIES OF MANKIND.--It is rational\r\nto believe that there is a magnetism existing between the bodies of\r\nmankind, which may have either a beneficial or a damaging effect upon\r\nour health, according to the conditions which are produced, or the\r\nnature of the individuals who are brought in contact with each other.\r\nAs an illustration of this point we might consider that, all nature is\r\ngoverned by the laws of attraction and repulsion, or in other words,\r\nby positive and negative forces. These subtle forces or laws in\r\nnature which we call attraction or repulsion, are governed by the\r\naffinity--or sameness--or the lack of affinity--or sameness--which\r\nexists between what may be termed the combination of atoms or\r\nmolecules which goes to make up organic structure.\r\n\r\n2. LAW OF ATTRACTION.--Where this affinity--or sameness--exists\r\nbetween the different things, there is what we term the law of\r\nattraction, or what may be termed the disposition to unite together.\r\nWhere there is no affinity existing between the nature of the\r\ndifferent particles of matter, there is what may be termed the law\r\nof repulsion, which has a tendency to destroy the harmony which would\r\notherwise take place.\r\n\r\n3. MAGNETISM OF THE MIND.--Now, what is true of the magnet and steel,\r\nis also true--from the sameness of their nature--of two bodies. And\r\nwhat is true of the body in this sense, is also true of the sameness\r\nor magnetism of the mind. Hence, _by the laying on of hands_, or by\r\nthe association of the minds of individuals, we reach the same result\r\nas when a combination is produced in any department of nature. Where\r\nthis sameness of affinity exists, there will be a blending of forces,\r\nwhich has a tendency to build up vitality.\r\n\r\n4. A PROOF.--As a proof of this position, how often have you found\r\nthe society of strangers to be so repulsive to your feelings, that\r\nyou have no disposition to associate. Others seem to bring with them\r\na soothing influence that draws you closer to them. All these\r\ninvoluntary likes and dislikes are but the results of the\r\n_animal magnetism_ that we are constantly throwing off from our\r\nbodies,--although seemingly imperceptible to our internal senses.--The\r\ndog can scent his master, and determine the course which he pursues,\r\nno doubt from similar influences.\r\n\r\n5. HOME HARMONY.--Many of the infirmities that afflict humanity are\r\nlargely due to a want of an understanding of its principles, and\r\nthe right applications of the same. I believe that if this law of\r\nmagnetism was more fully understood and acted upon, there would be a\r\nfar greater harmony in the domestic circle; the health of parents and\r\nchildren might often be preserved where now sickness and discord so\r\nfrequently prevail.\r\n\r\n6. THE LAW OF MAGNETISM.--When two bodies are brought into contact\r\nwith each other, the weak must naturally draw from the strong until\r\nboth have become equal. And as long as this equality exists there will\r\nbe perfect harmony between individuals, because of the reciprocation\r\nwhich exists in their nature.\r\n\r\n7. SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.--But if one should gain the advantage of\r\nthe other in magnetic attraction, the chances are that through the\r\nlaw of development, or what has been termed the \"Survival of the\r\nFittest\"--the stronger will rob the weaker until one becomes robust\r\nand healthy, while the other grows weaker and weaker day by day.\r\nThis frequently occurs with children sleeping together, also between\r\nhusband and wife.\r\n\r\n8. SLEEPING WITH INVALIDS.--Healthy, hearty, vigorous persons sleeping\r\nwith a diseased person is always at a disadvantage. The consumptive\r\npatient will draw from the strong, until the consumptive person\r\nbecomes the strong patient and the strong person will become the\r\nconsumptive. There are many cases on record to prove this statement.\r\nA well person should never sleep with an invalid if he desires to keep\r\nhis health unimpaired, for the weak will take from the strong, until\r\nthe strong becomes the weak and the weak the strong. Many a husband\r\nhas died from a lingering disease which saved his wife from an early\r\ngrave. He took the disease from his wife because he was the stronger,\r\nand she became better and he perished.\r\n\r\n9. HUSBAND AND WIFE.--It is not always wise that husband and wife\r\nshould sleep together, nor that children--whose temperament does not\r\nharmonize--should be compelled to sleep in the same bed. By the same\r\nlaw it is wrong for the young to sleep with old persons. Some have\r\nslept in the same bed with persons, when in the morning they have\r\ngotten up seemingly more tired than when they went to bed. At other\r\ntimes with different persons, they have lain awake two-thirds of\r\nthe night in pleasant conversation and have gotten up in the morning\r\nwithout scarcely realizing that they had been to sleep at all, yet\r\nhave felt perfectly rested and refreshed.\r\n\r\n10. MAGNETIC HEALING, OR WHAT HAS BEEN KNOWN AS THE LAYING ON OF\r\nHANDS.--A nervous prostration is a negative condition beneath the\r\nnatural, by the laying on of hands a person in a good, healthy\r\ncondition is capable of communicating to the necessity of the weak.\r\nFor the negative condition of the patient will as naturally draw from\r\nthe strong, as the loadstone draws from the magnet, until both become\r\nequally charged. And as fevers are a positive condition of the system\r\n\"beyond the natural,\" the normal condition of the healer will, by the\r\nlaying on of the hands, absorb these positive atoms, until the fever\r\nof the patient becomes reduced or cured. As a proof of this the\r\nmagnetic healer often finds himself or herself prostrated after\r\ntreating the weak, and excited or feverish after treating a feverish\r\npatient.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WELL MATED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHOW TO READ CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO TELL DISPOSITION AND CHARACTER BY THE NOSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. LARGE NOSES.--Bonaparte chose large-nosed men for his generals, and\r\nthe opinion prevails that large noses indicate long heads and strong\r\nminds. Not that great noses cause great minds, but that the motive or\r\npowerful temperament cause both.\r\n\r\n2. FLAT NOSES.--Flat noses indicate flatness of mind and character, by\r\nindicating a poor, low organic structure.\r\n\r\n3. BROAD NOSES.--Broad noses indicate large passage-ways to the lungs,\r\nand this, large lungs and vital organs and this, great strength of\r\nconstitution, and hearty animal passions along with selfishness; for\r\nbroad noses, broad shoulders, broad heads, and large animal organs go\r\ntogether. But when the nose is narrow at the base, the nostrils are\r\nsmall, because the lungs are small and need but small avenues for air;\r\nand this indicates a predisposition to consumptive complaints, along\r\nwith an active brain and nervous system, and a passionate fondness for\r\nliterary pursuits.\r\n\r\n4. SHARP NOSES.--Sharp noses indicate a quick, clear, penetrating,\r\nsearching, knowing, sagacious mind, and also a scold; indicate warmth\r\nof love, hate, generosity, moral sentiment--indeed, positiveness in\r\neverything.\r\n\r\n5. BLUNT NOSES.--Blunt noses indicate and accompany obtuse intellects\r\nand perceptions, sluggish feelings, and a soulless character.\r\n\r\n6. ROMAN NOSES.--The Roman nose indicates a martial spirit, love\r\nof debate, resistance, and strong passions, while hollow, pug\r\nnoses indicate a tame, easy, inert, sly character, and straight,\r\nfinely-formed Grecian noses harmonious characters. Seek their\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISPOSITION AND CHARACTER BY STATURE.\r\n\r\n1. TALL PERSONS.--Tall persons have high heads, and are aspiring, aim\r\nhigh, and seek conspicuousness, while short ones have flat heads, and\r\nseek the lower forms of worldly pleasures. Tall persons are rarely\r\nmean, though often grasping; but very penurious persons are often\r\nbroad-built.\r\n\r\n2. SMALL PERSONS.--Small persons generally have exquisite mentalities,\r\nyet less power--the more precious the article, the smaller the package\r\nin which it is done up,--while great men are rarely dwarfs, though\r\ngreat size often co-exists with sluggishness.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISPOSITION AND CHARACTER BY THE WALK.\r\n\r\n1. AWKWARD.--Those whose motions are awkward yet easy, possess much\r\nefficiency and positiveness of character, yet lack polish; and just\r\nin proportion as they become refined in mind will their movements be\r\ncorrespondingly improved. A short and quick step indicates a brisk and\r\nactive but rather contracted mind, whereas those who take long steps\r\ngenerally have long heads; yet if the step is slow, they will make\r\ncomparatively little progress, while those whose step is long and\r\nquick will accomplish proportionately much, and pass most of their\r\ncompetitors on the highway of life.\r\n\r\n2. A DRAGGING STEP.--Those who sluff or drag their heels, drag and\r\ndrawl in everything; while those who walk with a springing, bouncing\r\nstep, abound in mental snap and spring. Those whose walk is mincing,\r\naffected, and artificial, rarely, if ever, accomplish much; whereas\r\nthose who walk carelessly, that is, naturally, are just what they\r\nappear to be, and put on nothing for outside show.\r\n\r\n3. THE DIFFERENT MODES OF WALKING.--In short, every individual has\r\nhis own peculiar mode of moving, which exactly accords with his mental\r\ncharacter; so that, as far as you can see such modes, you can decipher\r\nsuch outlines of character.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DISPOSITION AND CHARACTER BY LAUGHING.\r\n\r\n1. LAUGHTER EXPRESSIVE OF CHARACTER.--Laughter is very expressive\r\nof character. Those who laugh very heartily have much cordiality and\r\nwhole-souledness of character, except that those who laugh heartily at\r\ntrifles have much feeling, yet little sense. Those whose giggles\r\nare rapid but light, have much intensity of feeling, yet lack power;\r\nwhereas those who combine rapidity with force in laughing, combine\r\nthem in character.\r\n\r\n2. VULGAR LAUGH.--Vulgar persons always laugh vulgarly, and refined\r\npersons show refinement in their laugh. Those who ha, ha right out,\r\nunreservedly, have no cunning, and are open-hearted in everything;\r\nwhile those who suppress laughter, and try to control their\r\ncountenances in it, are more or less secretive. Those who laugh with\r\ntheir mouths closed are non-committal; while those who throw it wide\r\nopen are unguarded and unequivocal in character.\r\n\r\n3. SUPPRESSED LAUGHTER.--Those who, suppressing laughter for a\r\nwhile, burst forth volcano-like, have strong characteristics, but are\r\nwell-governed, yet violent when they give way to their feelings. Then\r\nthere is the intellectual laugh, the love laugh, the horse laugh, the\r\nphiloprogenitive laugh, the friendly laugh, and many other kinds of\r\nlaugh, each indicative of corresponding mental developments.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISPOSITION AND CHARACTER BY THE MODE OF SHAKING HANDS.\r\n\r\nTHEIR EXPRESSION OF CHARACTER.--Thus, those who give a tame and loose\r\nhand, and shake lightly, have a cold, if not heartless and selfish\r\ndisposition, rarely sacrificing much for others, are probably\r\nconservatives, and lack warmth and soul. But those who grasp\r\nfirmly, and shake heartily, have a corresponding whole-souledness of\r\ncharacter, are hospitable, and will sacrifice business to friends;\r\nwhile those who bow low when they shake hands, add deference to\r\nfriendship, and are easily led, for good or bad, by friends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EASY-GOING DISPOSITION.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DISPOSITION AND CHARACTER BY THE MOUTH AND EYES.\r\n\r\n1. DIFFERENT FORMS OF MOUTHS.--Every mouth differs from every\r\nother, and indicates a coincident character. Large mouths express\r\na corresponding quantity of mentality, while small ones indicate a\r\nlesser amount. A coarsely-formed mouth indicates power, while one\r\nfinely-formed indicates exquisite susceptibilities. Hence small,\r\ndelicately formed mouths indicate only common minds, with very fine\r\nfeelings and much perfection of character.\r\n\r\n2. CHARACTERISTICS.--Whenever the muscles about the mouth are\r\ndistinct, the character is correspondingly positive, and the reverse.\r\nThose who open their mouths wide and frequently, thereby evince an\r\nopen soul, while closed mouths, unless to hide deformed teeth, are\r\nproportionately secretive.\r\n\r\n3. EYES.--Those who keep their eyes half shut are peek-a-boos and\r\neaves-droppers.\r\n\r\n4. EXPRESSIONS OF THE EYE.--The mere expression of the eye conveys\r\nprecise ideas of the existing and predominant states of the mentality\r\nand physiology. As long as the constitution remains unimpaired,\r\nthe eye is clear and bright, but becomes languid and soulless in\r\nproportion as the brain has been enfeebled. Wild, erratic persons\r\nhave a half-crazed expression of eye, while calmness, benignancy,\r\nintelligence, purity, sweetness, love, lasciviousness, anger, and all\r\nthe other mental affections, express themselves quite as distinctly by\r\nthe eye as voice, or any other mode.\r\n\r\n6. COLOR OF THE EYES.--Some inherit fineness from one parent, and\r\ncoarseness from the other, while the color of the eye generally\r\ncorresponds with that of the skin, and expresses character. Light eyes\r\nindicate warmth of feeling, and dark eyes power.\r\n\r\n6. GARMENTS.--Those, who keep their coats buttoned up, fancy\r\nhigh-necked and closed dresses, etc., are equally non-communicative,\r\nbut those who like open, free, flowing garments, are equally\r\nopen-hearted and communicative.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DISPOSITION AND CHARACTER BY THE COLOR OF THE HAIR.\r\n\r\n1. DIFFERENT COLORS.--Coarseness and fineness of texture in nature\r\nindicate coarse and fine-grained feelings and characters, and since\r\nblack signifies power, and red ardor, therefore coarse black hair\r\nand skin signify great power of character of some kind, along with\r\nconsiderable tendency to the sensual; yet fine black hair and skin\r\nindicate strength of character, along with purity and goodness.\r\n\r\n2. COARSE HAIR.--Coarse black hair and skin, and coarse red hair\r\nand whiskers, indicate powerful animal passions, together with\r\ncorresponding strength of character; while fine or light, or auburn\r\nhair indicates quick susceptibilities, together with refinement and\r\ngood taste.\r\n\r\n3. FINE HAIR.--Fine dark or brown hair indicates the combination of\r\nexquisite susceptibilities with great strength of character, while\r\nauburn hair, with a florid countenance, indicates the highest order of\r\nsentiment and intensity of feeling, along with corresponding purity\r\nof character, combined with the highest capacities for enjoyment and\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\n4. CURLY HAIR.--Curly hair or beard indicates a crisp, excitable, and\r\nvariable disposition, and much diversity of character--now blowing\r\nhot, now cold--along with intense love and hate, gushing, glowing\r\nemotions, brilliancy, and variety of talent. So look out for ringlets;\r\nthey betoken April weather--treat them gently, lovingly, and you\r\nwill have the brightest, clearest sunshine, and the sweetest balmiest\r\nbreezes.\r\n\r\n5. STRAIGHT HAIR.--Straight, even, smooth, and glossy hair indicate\r\nstrength, harmony, and evenness of character, and hearty, whole-souled\r\naffections, as well as a clear head and superior talents; while\r\nstraight, stiff, black hair and beard indicate a coarse, strong,\r\nrigid, straight-forward character.\r\n\r\n6. ABUNDANCE OF HAIR.--Abundance of hair and beard signifies virility\r\nand a great amount of character; while a thin beard signifies\r\nsterility and a thinly settled upper story, with rooms to let, so that\r\nthe beard is very significant of character.\r\n\r\n7. FIERY RED HAIR indicates a quick and fiery disposition. Persons\r\nwith such hair generally have intense feelings--love and hate\r\nintensely--yet treat them kindly, and you have the warmest friends,\r\nbut ruffle them, and you raise a hurricane on short notice. This is\r\ndoubly true of auburn curls. It takes but little kindness, however, to\r\nproduce a calm and render them as fair as a Summer morning. Red-headed\r\npeople in general are not given to hold a grudge. They are generally\r\nof a very forgiving disposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECRETIVE DISPOSITIONS.\r\n\r\n1. A man that naturally wears his hat upon the top or back of the head\r\nis frank and outspoken; will easily confide and have many confidential\r\nfriends, and is less liable to keep a secret. He will never do you any\r\nharm.\r\n\r\n2. If a man wears his hat well down on the forehead, shading the eyes\r\nmore or less, will always keep his own counsel. He will not confide a\r\nsecret, and if criminally inclined will be a very dangerous character.\r\n\r\n3. If a lady naturally inclines to high-necked dresses and collars,\r\nshe will keep her secrets to herself if she has any. In courtship or\r\nlove she is an uncertainty, as she will not reveal sentiments of her\r\nheart. The secretive girl, however, usually makes a good housekeeper\r\nand rarely gets mixed into neighborhood difficulties. As a wife she\r\nwill not be the most affectionate, nor will she trouble her husband\r\nwith many of her trials or difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTWILIGHT SLEEP.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome years ago two German Physicians, Kroenig and Grauss, of the\r\nUniversity of Baden, startled the world by announcing: \"Dammerschlaf\"\r\nor \"Twilight Sleep,\" a treatment which rendered childbirth almost\r\npainless and free from dangerous complications. A woman's clinic\r\nwas established at Freiburg where a combination of scopolamine and\r\nmorphine was given. The muscular activity of the pelvic organs was\r\nnot lessened, the length of labor was shortened, and instruments were\r\nrarely necessary.\r\n\r\nABBOTT'S H-M-C is another sedative composed of hyoseine, morphine, and\r\ncactoid. It is less dangerous than the other remedy, and accomplishes\r\nthe same result, hence is greatly preferred.\r\n\r\nTHE UTMOST CAUTION is necessary in the administration of either of\r\nthese drugs, and the most competent medical supervision is essential\r\nto their success.\r\n\r\nCAUTIONS.--The patient should not be left a moment without medical\r\nsupervision. The lying in chamber should be darkened, and kept as\r\nquiet as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPAINLESS CHILDBIRTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY SHOULD A WOMAN SUFFER?--Childbirth is a natural function, as\r\nnatural as eating, sleeping or walking. If the laws of nature are\r\ncomplied with it loses most, if not all, of its terrors. The facts\r\nshow that Indian women, and those of other uncivilized races have\r\nchildren without experiencing pain, and with none of the so common\r\nmodern complications.\r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE REASON?--They live a natural, out of doors life, free from\r\nthe evils and restrictions of present day civilization in dress and\r\nhabits of life.\r\n\r\nA NORMAL LIFE.--The expectant mother should therefore live a perfectly\r\nrational life, keeping the stomach and intestines especially healthy\r\nand active, and hence the general physical condition good. An\r\nabundance of fresh air, hearty exercise, and childbirth will pass over\r\nwithout any abnormal consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE DISEASES OF WOMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOMAN'S PLACE IS IN THE HOME.--For centuries the world has stuck\r\nto this rule. Because the woman has been considered less fit for the\r\nstruggles of the active workaday world, she has been kept at home,\r\nshut in from the air and sunshine, deprived of healthy exercise, and\r\nobliged to live a life of confinement and inactivity.\r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE RESULT?--In connection with menstruation, pregnancy and\r\nchild bearing a long list of diseases peculiar to woman have arisen,\r\nmost of which through proper food and exercise could be avoided.\r\nIn matters so vital to posterity false modesty and ignorance can no\r\nlonger be tolerated.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHLOROSIS OR ANAEMIA.\r\n\r\n_Home Treatment_: Plenty of good food and fresh air will do much to\r\nrestore the blood. Keep the bowels free. Satisfactory results have\r\nbeen brought about by a systematic use of iron as a tonic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISORDERS OF THE MENSES.\r\n\r\nRETENTION OF MENSTRUATION.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_: When due to the condition of the blood, recommend good\r\nfood, fresh air, and sunshine to improve circulation. If the result of\r\ncold and exposure means and appliances for restoring the circulation\r\nmust be adopted.\r\n\r\nIn either case the bowels should be kept open by injections.\r\n\r\n\r\nVICARIOUS MENSTRUATION.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_: No attempt should be made to stop the hemorrhage during\r\nthe monthly period. The discharge is usually light although it\r\noccasionally causes great weakness. This disorder is caused by the\r\nsuppression of the menses, and must be treated accordingly between\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\n\r\nCESSATION OF THE MENSES.\r\n\r\nCommonly called \"Change of Life.\"\r\n\r\n_Treatment_: At this dangerous and trying period in a woman's life she\r\nmust adopt the utmost regularity in the habits of her existence. Hot\r\nbaths, taken just before retiring, will relieve the uncomfortable\r\nfeeling so common at this time of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISORDERS OF THE WOMB.\r\n\r\nCANCER OF THE WOMB.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_: Call at once a competent physician.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISPLACEMENT OF THE WOMB.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_: Evacuate the bowels and the bladder by means of\r\ninjections, and the catheter. Place the fingers in the vagina, locate\r\nthe mouth of the womb, insert finger into it, and gently pull the\r\norgan into its natural position.\r\n\r\n\r\nDROPSY OF THE WOMB.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_: Use tonics freely together with vapor baths, and frequent\r\nhot hip baths.\r\n\r\n\r\nFALLING OF THE WOMB.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_: Build up the physical condition by an abundance of good\r\nfood, fresh air and sunshine, with moderate exercise. Astringent\r\ninjections and vaginal suppositories of oak bark, myrrh, and\r\ncocoa-butter will usually bring relief.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE WOMB.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_: Apply stimulating liniment to the abdomen. Keep body warm\r\nand moist especially at extremities. Add 10-15 drops of carbolic acid\r\nto one quart of warm water and use as a vaginal douche. Keep bowels\r\nopen. Furnish light, nourishing diet, and give tonics.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEURALGIA OF THE WOMB.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_: Keep feet warm and give injections to the bowels of\r\nlobelia, lady slipper, and skullcap. Rub the abdomen with liniment.\r\nAbsolute quiet, above all else, will bring relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE VAGINA.\r\n\r\nVAGINITIS, OR INFLAMMATION OF THE VAGINA.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_: Complete rest. Use distilled sweet clover with a\r\nslight infusion of lady slipper warm, three times a day as a vaginal\r\ninjection.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROLAPSUS OF THE VAGINA.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_: When the walls of the vagina become folded upon\r\nthemselves through abortion, rupture during delivery, excessive\r\nindulgence, masturbation, etc. it is called prolapsus. Use an\r\nastringent suppository or injection.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPASM OF THE VAGINA.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_: This is nothing more than a nervous condition causing the\r\nmuscles of the vagina to spasm thus closing the passage, and rendering\r\nconception almost impossible. Outdoor exercise, light but nourishing\r\ndiet, and general attention to the nervous system will bring prompt\r\nrelief. Intercourse, if attempted, should be quiet and unfrequent.

Use mild\r\nlaxatives to keep the bowels open.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE OVARIES.\r\n\r\nDROPSY OF THE OVARIES.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_: An accumulation of fluid in the membranous sack about the\r\novaries. An operation is necessary and is almost always successful.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE OVARIES.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_: In mild cases rub abdomen with liniment and apply hot\r\nwater bottles. Perfect quiet is essential to an early recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUMORS OF THE OVARIES.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_: A surgical operation is the only means of cure.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nREMEDIES FOR DISEASES OF WOMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER PAINS: Salophen in fifteen grain doses.
