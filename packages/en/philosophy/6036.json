B.\r\n\r\nVienna, Nov., 1880.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KASÎDAH\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hour is nigh; the waning Queen\r\n   walks forth to rule the later night;\r\nCrownd with the sparkle of a Star,\r\n   and throned on orb of ashen light:\r\n\r\nThe Wolf-tail* sweeps the paling East\r\n   to leave a deeper gloom behind,\r\nAnd Dawn uprears her shining head,\r\n   sighing with semblance of a wind:\r\n\r\n   * The false dawn.\r\n\r\nThe highlands catch yon Orient gleam,\r\n   while purpling still the lowlands lie;\r\nAnd pearly mists, the morning-pride,\r\n   soar incense-like to greet the sky.\r\n\r\nThe horses neigh, the camels groan,\r\n   the torches gleam, the cressets flare;\r\nThe town of canvas falls, and man\r\n   with din and dint invadeth air:\r\n\r\nThe Golden Gates swing right and left;\r\n   up springs the Sun with flamy brow;\r\nThe dew-cloud melts in gush of light;\r\n   brown Earth is bathed in morning-glow.\r\n\r\nSlowly they wind athwart the wild,\r\n   and while young Day his anthem swells,\r\nSad falls upon my yearning ear\r\n   the tinkling of the Camel-bells:\r\n\r\nOer fiery wastes and frozen wold,\r\n   oer horrid hill and gloomy glen,\r\nThe home of grisly beast and Ghoul,*\r\n   the haunts of wilder, grislier men;\r\n\r\n   * The Demon of the Desert.\r\n\r\nWith the brief gladness of the Palms,\r\n   that tower and sway oer seething plain,\r\nFraught with the thoughts of rustling shade,\r\n   and welling spring, and rushing rain;\r\n\r\nWith the short solace of the ridge,\r\n   by gentle zephyrs played upon,\r\nWhose breezy head and bosky side\r\n   front seas of cooly celadon;\r\n\r\nTis theirs to pass with joy and hope,\r\n   whose souls shall ever thrill and fill\r\nDreams of the Birthplace and the Tomb,\r\n   visions of Allahs Holy Hill.*\r\n\r\n   * Arafât, near Mecca.\r\n\r\nBut we? Another shift of scene,\r\n   another pang to rack the heart;\r\nWhy meet we on the bridge of Time\r\n   to change one greeting and to part?\r\n\r\nWe meet to part; yet asks my sprite,\r\n   Part we to meet? Ah! is it so?\r\nMans fancy-made Omniscience knows,\r\n   who made Omniscience nought can know.\r\n\r\nWhy must we meet, why must we part,\r\n   why must we bear this yoke of MUST,\r\nWithout our leave or askt or given,\r\n   by tyrant Fate on victim thrust?\r\n\r\nThat Eve so gay, so bright, so glad,\r\n   this Morn so dim, and sad, and grey;\r\nStrange that lifes Registrar should write\r\n   this day a day, that day a day!\r\n\r\nMine eyes, my brain, my heart, are sad,\r\n   sad is the very core of me;\r\nAll wearies, changes, passes, ends;\r\n   alas! the Birthdays injury!\r\n\r\nFriends of my youth, a last adieu!\r\n   haply some day we meet again;\r\nYet neer the self-same men shall meet;\r\n   the years shall make us other men:\r\n\r\nThe light of morn has grown to noon,\r\n   has paled with eve, and now farewell!\r\nGo, vanish from my Life as dies\r\n   the tinkling of the Camels bell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn these drear wastes of sea-born land,\r\n   these wilds where none may dwell but He,\r\nWhat visionary Pasts revive,\r\n   what process of the Years we see:\r\n\r\nGazing beyond the thin blue line\r\n   that rims the far horizon-ring,\r\nOur saddend sight why haunt these ghosts,\r\n   whence do these spectral shadows spring?\r\n\r\nWhat endless questions vex the thought,\r\n   of Whence and Whither, When and How?\r\nWhat fond and foolish strife to read\r\n   the Scripture writ on human brow;\r\n\r\nAs stand we percht on point of Time,\r\n   betwixt the two Eternities,\r\nWhose awful secrets gathering round\r\n   with black profound oppress our eyes.\r\n\r\nThis gloomy night, these grisly waves,\r\n   these winds and whirlpools loud and dread:\r\nWhat reck they of our wretched plight\r\n   who Safetys shore so lightly tread?\r\n\r\nThus quoth the Bard of Love and Wine,*\r\n   whose dream of Heaven neer could rise\r\nBeyond the brimming Kausar-cup\r\n   and Houris with the white-black eyes;\r\n\r\n   * Hâfiz of Shirâz.\r\n\r\nAh me! my race of threescore years\r\n   is short, but long enough to pall\r\nMy sense with joyless joys as these,\r\n   with Love and Houris, Wine and all.\r\n\r\nAnother boasts he would divorce\r\n   old barren Reason from his bed,\r\nAnd wed the Vine-maid in her stead;\r\n   fools who believe a word he said!*\r\n\r\n   * Omar-i-Kayyâm, the tent-maker poet of Persia.\r\n\r\nAnd Dust thou art to dust returning.\r\n   neer was spoke of human soul\r\nThe Soofi cries, tis well for him\r\n   that hath such gift to ask its goal.\r\n\r\nAnd this is all, for this were born\r\n   to weep a little and to die!\r\nSo sings the shallow bard whose life\r\n   still labours at the letter I.\r\n\r\nEar never heard, Eye never saw\r\n   the bliss of those who enter in\r\nMy heavenly kingdom, Isâ said,\r\n   who wailed our sorrows and our sin:\r\n\r\nToo much of words or yet too few!\r\n   What to thy Godhead easier than\r\nOne little glimpse of Paradise\r\n   to ope the eyes and ears of man?\r\n\r\nI am the Truth! I am the Truth!\r\n   we hear the God-drunk gnostic cry\r\nThe microcosm abides in ME;\r\n   Eternal Allahs nought but I!\r\n\r\nMansûr* was wise, but wiser they\r\n   who smote him with the hurlèd stones;\r\nAnd, though his blood a witness bore,\r\n   no wisdom-might could mend his bones.\r\n\r\n   * A famous Mystic stoned for blasphemy.\r\n\r\nEat, drink, and sport; the rest of lifes\r\n   not worth a fillip, quoth the King;\r\nMethinks the saying saith too much:\r\n   the swine would say the selfsame thing!\r\n\r\nTwo-footed beasts that browse through life,\r\n   by Death to serve as soil designd,\r\nBow prone to Earth whereof they be,\r\n   and there the proper pleasures find:\r\n\r\nBut you of finer, nobler, stuff,\r\n   ye, whom to Higher leads the High,\r\nWhat binds your hearts in common bond\r\n   with creatures of the stall and sty?\r\n\r\nIn certain hope of Life-to-come\r\n   I journey through this shifting scene\r\nThe Zâhid* snarls and saunters down\r\n   his Vale of Tears with confident mien.\r\n\r\n   * The Philister of respectable belief.\r\n\r\nWiser than Amrâns Son* art thou,\r\n   who kenst so well the world-to-be,\r\nThe Future when the Past is not,\r\n   the Present merest dreamery;\r\n\r\n   * Moses in the Koran.\r\n\r\nWhat knowst thou, man, of Life? and yet,\r\n   forever twixt the womb, the grave,\r\nThou pratest of the Coming Life,\r\n   of Heavn and Hell thou fain must rave.\r\n\r\nThe world is old and thou art young;\r\n   the world is large and thou art small;\r\nCease, atom of a moments span,\r\n   To hold thyself an All-in-All!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFie, fie! you visionary things,\r\n   ye motes that dance in sunny glow,\r\nWho base and build Eternities\r\n   on briefest moment here below;\r\n\r\nWho pass through Life liked cagèd birds,\r\n   the captives of a despot will;\r\nStill wondring How and When and Why,\r\n   and Whence and Whither, wondring still;\r\n\r\nStill wondring how the Marvel came\r\n   because two coupling mammals chose\r\nTo slake the thirst of fleshly love,\r\n   and thus the Immortal Being rose;\r\n\r\nWondring the Babe with staring eyes,\r\n   perforce compeld from night to day,\r\nGript in the giant grasp of Life\r\n   like gale-born dust or wind-wrung spray;\r\n\r\nWho comes imbecile to the world\r\n   mid double danger, groans, and tears;\r\nThe toy, the sport, the waif and stray\r\n   of passions, error, wrath and fears;\r\n\r\nWho knows not Whence he came nor Why,\r\n   who kens not Whither bound and When,\r\nYet such is Allahs choicest gift,\r\n   the blessing dreamt by foolish men;\r\n\r\nWho step by step perforce returns\r\n   to couthless youth, wan, white and cold,\r\nLisping again his broken words\r\n   till all the tale be fully told:\r\n\r\nWondring the Babe with quenchèd orbs,\r\n   an oldster bowd by burthening years,\r\nHow scaped the skiff an hundred storms;\r\n   how scaped the thread a thousand shears;\r\n\r\nHow coming to the Feast unbid,\r\n   he found the gorgeous table spread\r\nWith the fair-seeming Sodom-fruit,\r\n   with stones that bear the shape of bread:\r\n\r\nHow Life was nought but ray of sun\r\n   that clove the darkness thick and blind,\r\nThe ravings of the reckless storm,\r\n   the shrieking of the ravening wind;\r\n\r\nHow lovely visions guiled his sleep,\r\n   aye fading with the break of morn,\r\nTill every sweet became a sour,\r\n   till every rose became a thorn;\r\n\r\nTill dust and ashes met his eyes\r\n   wherever turned their saddened gaze;\r\nThe wrecks of joys and hopes and loves,\r\n   the rubbish of his wasted days;\r\n\r\nHow every high heroic Thought\r\n   that longed to breathe empyrean air,\r\nFailed of its feathers, fell to earth,\r\n   and perisht of a sheer despair;\r\n\r\nHow, dowerd with heritage of brain,\r\n   whose might has split the solar ray,\r\nHis rest is grossest coarsest earth,\r\n   a crown of gold on brow of clay;\r\n\r\nThis House whose frame be flesh and bone,\r\n   mortard with blood and faced with skin,\r\nThe home of sickness, dolours, age;\r\n   unclean without, impure within:\r\n\r\nSans ray to cheer its inner gloom,\r\n   the chambers haunted by the Ghost,\r\nDarkness his name, a cold dumb Shade\r\n   stronger than all the heavnly host.\r\n\r\nThis tube, an enigmatic pipe,\r\n   whose end was laid before begun,\r\nThat lengthens, broadens, shrinks and breaks;\r\n   puzzle, machine, automaton;\r\n\r\nThe first of Pots the Potter made\r\n   by Chrysorrhoas blue-green wave;*\r\nMethinks I see him smile to see\r\n   what guerdon to the world he gave!\r\n\r\n   * The Abana, River of Damascus.\r\n\r\nHow Life is dim, unreal, vain,\r\n   like scenes that round the drunkard reel;\r\nHow Being meaneth not to be;\r\n   to see and hear, smell, taste and feel.\r\n\r\nA drop in Oceans boundless tide,\r\n   unfathomd waste of agony;\r\nWhere millions live their horrid lives\r\n   by making other millions die.\r\n\r\nHow with a heart that would through love\r\n   to Universal Love aspire,\r\nMan woos infernal chance to smite,\r\n   as Minarets draw the Thunder-fire.\r\n\r\nHow Earth on Earth builds tower and wall,\r\n   to crumble at a touch of Time;\r\nHow Earth on Earth from Shînar-plain\r\n   the heights of Heaven fain would climb.\r\n\r\nHow short this Life, how long withal;\r\n   how false its weal, how true its woes,\r\nThis fever-fit with paroxysms\r\n   to mark its opening and its close.\r\n\r\nAh! gay the day with shine of sun,\r\n   and bright the breeze, and blithe the throng\r\nMet on the River-bank to play,\r\n   when I was young, when I was young:\r\n\r\nSuch general joy could never fade;\r\n   and yet the chilling whisper came\r\nOne face had paled, one form had failed;\r\n   had fled the bank, had swum the stream;\r\n\r\nStill revellers danced, and sang, and trod\r\n   the hither bank of Times deep tide,\r\nStill one by one they left and fared\r\n   to the far misty thither side;\r\n\r\nAnd now the last hath slipt away\r\n   yon drear Death-desert to explore,\r\nAnd now one Pilgrim worn and lorn\r\n   still lingers on the lonely shore.\r\n\r\nYes, Life in youth-tide standeth still;\r\n   in manhood streameth soft and slow;\r\nSee, as it nears the abysmal goal\r\n   how fleet the waters flash and flow!\r\n\r\nAnd Deaths are twain; the Deaths we see\r\n   drop like the leaves in windy Fall;\r\nBut ours, our own, are ruined worlds,\r\n   a globe collapst, last end of all.\r\n\r\nWe live our lives with rogues and fools,\r\n   dead and alive, alive and dead,\r\nWe die twixt one who feels the pulse\r\n   and one who frets and clouds the head:\r\n\r\nAnd,oh, the Pity!hardly conned\r\n   the lesson comes its fatal term;\r\nFate bids us bundle up our books,\r\n   and bear them bodily to the worm:\r\n\r\nHardly we learn to wield the blade\r\n   before the wrist grows stiff and old;\r\nHardly we learn to ply the pen\r\n   ere Thought and Fancy faint with cold.\r\n\r\nHardly we find the path of love,\r\n   to sink the self, forget the I,\r\nWhen sad suspicion grips the heart,\r\n   when Man, _the_ Man begins to die:\r\n\r\nHardly we scale the wisdom-heights,\r\n   and sight the Pisgah-scene around,\r\nAnd breathe the breath of heavenly air,\r\n   and hear the Spheres harmonious sound;\r\n\r\nWhen swift the Camel-rider spans\r\n   the howling waste, by Kismet sped,\r\nAnd of his Magic Wand a wave\r\n   hurries the quick to join the dead.*\r\n\r\n   * Death in Arabia rides a Camel, not a pale horse.\r\n\r\nHow sore the burden, strange the strife;\r\n   how full of splendour, wonder, fear;\r\nLife, atom of that Infinite Space\r\n   that stretcheth twixt the Here and There.\r\n\r\nHow Thought is impotent to divine\r\n   the secret which the gods defend,\r\nThe Why of birth and life and death,\r\n   that Isis-veil no hand may rend.\r\n\r\nEternal Morrows make our Day;\r\n   our _Is_ is aye _to be_ till when\r\nNight closes in; tis all a dream,\r\n   and yet we die,and then and THEN?\r\n\r\nAnd still the Weaver plies his loom,\r\n   whose warp and woof is wretched Man\r\nWeaving th unpatternd dark design,\r\n   so dark we doubt it owns a plan.\r\n\r\nDost not, O Maker, blush to hear,\r\n   amid the storm of tears and blood,\r\nMan say Thy mercy made what is,\r\n   and saw the made and said twas good?\r\n\r\nThe marvel is that man can smile\r\n   dreaming his ghostly ghastly dream;-\r\nBetter the heedless atomy\r\n   that buzzes in the morning beam!\r\n\r\nO the dread pathos of our lives!\r\n   how durst thou, Allah, thus to play\r\nWith Love, Affection, Friendship, all\r\n   that shows the god in mortal clay?\r\n\r\nBut ah! what vaileth man to mourn;\r\n   shall tears bring forth what smiles neer brought;\r\nShall brooding breed a thought of joy?\r\n   Ah hush the sigh, forget the thought!\r\n\r\nSilence thine immemorial quest,\r\n   contain thy natures vain complaint\r\nNone heeds, none cares for thee or thine;\r\n   like thee how many came and went?\r\n\r\nCease, Man, to mourn, to weep, to wail;\r\n   enjoy thy shining hour of sun;\r\nWe dance along Deaths icy brink,\r\n   but is the dance less full of fun?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Truths hath gleaned that Sage consumed\r\n   by many a moon that waxt and waned?\r\nWhat Prophet-strain be his to sing?\r\n   What hath his old Experience gained?\r\n\r\nThere is no God, no man-made God;\r\n   a bigger, stronger, crueller man;\r\nBlack phantom of our baby-fears,\r\n   ere Thought, the life of Life, began.\r\n\r\nRight quoth the Hindu Prince of old,*\r\n   An Ishwara for one I nill,\r\nTh almighty everlasting Good\r\n   who cannot bate th Eternal Ill:\r\n\r\n   * Buddha.\r\n\r\nYour gods may be, what shows they are?\r\n   hear Chinas Perfect Sage declare;*\r\nAnd being, what to us be they\r\n   who dwell so darkly and so far?\r\n\r\n   * Confucius.\r\n\r\nAll matter hath a birth and death;\r\n   tis made, unmade and made anew;\r\nWe choose to call the Maker God:\r\n   such is the Zâhids owly view.\r\n\r\nYou changeful finite Creatures strain\r\n   (rejoins the Drawer of the Wine)*\r\nThe dizzy depths of Infinite Power\r\n   to fathom with your foot of twine;\r\n\r\n   * The Soofi or Gnostic opposed to the Zâhid.\r\n\r\nPoor idols of mans heart and head\r\n   with the Divine Idea to blend;\r\nTo preach as Natures Common Course\r\n   what any hour may shift or end.\r\n\r\nHow shall the Shown pretend to ken\r\n   aught of the Showman or the Show?\r\nWhy meanly bargain to believe,\r\n   which only means thou neer canst know?\r\n\r\nHow may the passing Now contain\r\n   the standing NowEternity?\r\nAn endless _is_ without a _was_,\r\n   the _be_ and never the _to-be?_\r\n\r\nWho made your Maker?

A native, it is believed, of Darâbghird in the Yezd\r\nProvince, he always preferred to style himself El-Hichmakâni, a\r\nfacetious lackab or surname, meaning Of No-hall, Nowhere. He\r\nhad travelled far and wide with his eyes open; as appears by his\r\ncouplets. To a natural facility, a knack of language learning,\r\nhe added a store of desultory various reading; scraps of Chinese\r\nand old Egyptian; of Hebrew and Syriac; of Sanskrit and Prakrit;\r\nof Slav, especially Lithuanian; of Latin and Greek, including\r\nRomaic; of Berber, the Nubian dialect, and of Zend and Akkadian,\r\nbesides Persian, his mother-tongue, and Arabic, the classic of\r\nthe schools. Nor was he ignorant of the -ologies and the\r\ntriumphs of modern scientific discovery. Briefly, his memory was\r\nwell-stored; and he had every talent save that of using his\r\ntalents.\r\n\r\nBut no one thought that he wood the Muse, to speak in the\r\nstyle of the last century. Even his intimates were ignorant of\r\nthe fact that he had a skeleton in his cupboard, his Kasîdah or\r\ndistichs. He confided to me his secret when we last met in\r\nWestern IndiaI am purposely vague in specifying the place. When\r\nso doing he held in hand the long and hoary honours of his chin\r\nwith the points toward me, as if to say with the Island-King:\r\n\r\n   There is a touch of Winter in my beard,\r\n   A sign the Gods will guard me from imprudence.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the piercing eye, clear as an onyx, seemed to protest\r\nagainst the plea of age. The MS. was in the vilest Shikastah or\r\nrunning-hand; and, as I carried it off, the writer declined to\r\ntake the trouble of copying out his cacograph.\r\n\r\nWe, his old friends, had long addressed Hâjî Abdû by the\r\nsobriquet of _Nabbianâ_ (our Prophet); and the reader will see\r\nthat the Pilgrim has, or believes he has, a message to deliver.\r\nHe evidently aspires to preach a faith of his own; an Eastern\r\nVersion of Humanitarianism blended with the sceptical or, as we\r\nnow say, the scientific habit of mind. The religion, of which\r\nFetishism, Hinduism and Heathendom; Judæism, Christianity and\r\nIslamism are mere fractions, may, methinks, be accepted by the\r\nPhilosopher: it worships with single-minded devotion the Holy\r\nCause of Truth, of Truth for its own sake, not for the goods it\r\nmay bring; and this belief is equally acceptable to honest\r\nignorance, and to the highest attainments in nature-study.\r\n\r\nWith Confucius, the Hâjî cultivates what Strauss has called the\r\nstern common-sense of mankind; while the reign of order is a\r\nparagraph of his Higher Law. He traces from its rudest\r\nbeginnings the all but absolute universality of some perception\r\nby man, called Faith; that _sensus Numinis_ which, by\r\ninheritance or communication, is now universal except in those\r\nwho force themselves to oppose it. And he evidently holds this\r\ngeneral consent of mankind to be so far divine that it primarily\r\ndiscovered for itself, if it did not create, a divinity. He does\r\nnot cry with the Christ of Novalis, Children, you have no\r\nfather; and perhaps he would join Renan in exclaiming, _Un monde\r\nsans Dieu est horrible!_\r\n\r\nBut he recognises the incompatibility of the Infinite with the\r\nDefinite; of a Being who loves, who thinks, who hates; of an\r\n_Actus purus_ who is called jealous, wrathful and revengeful,\r\nwith an Eternal that makes for righteousness. In the presence\r\nof the endless contradictions, which spring from the idea of a\r\nPersonal Deity, with the Synthesis, the _Begriff_ of Providence,\r\nour Agnostic takes refuge in the sentiment of an unknown and an\r\nunknowable. He objects to the countless variety of forms assumed\r\nby the perception of a _Causa Causans_ (a misnomer), and to that\r\nintellectual adoption of general propositions, capable of\r\ndistinct statement but incapable of proofs, which we term Belief.\r\n\r\nHe looks with impartial eye upon the endless variety of systems,\r\nmaintained with equal confidence and self-sufficiency, by men of\r\nequal ability and honesty. He is weary of wandering over the\r\nworld, and of finding every petty race wedded to its own\r\nopinions; claiming the monopoly of Truth; holding all others to\r\nbe in error, and raising disputes whose violence, acerbity and\r\nvirulence are in inverse ratio to the importance of the disputed\r\nmatter. A peculiarly active and acute observation taught him that\r\nmany of these jarring families, especially those of the same\r\nblood, are par in the intellectual processes of perception and\r\nreflection; that in the business of the visible working world\r\nthey are confessedly by no means superior to one another; whereas\r\nin abstruse matters of mere Faith, not admitting direct and\r\nsensual evidence, one in a hundred will claim to be right, and\r\nimmodestly charge the other ninety-nine with being wrong.\r\n\r\nThus he seeks to discover a system which will prove them all\r\nright, and all wrong; which will reconcile their differences;\r\nwill unite past creeds; will account for the present, and will\r\nanticipate the future with a continuous and uninterrupted\r\ndevelopment; this, too, by a process, not negative and\r\ndistinctive, but, on the contrary, intensely positive and\r\nconstructive. I am not called upon to sit in the seat of\r\njudgment; but I may say that it would be singular if the attempt\r\nsucceeded. Such a system would be all-comprehensive, because not\r\nlimited by space, time, or race; its principle would be extensive\r\nas Matter itself, and, consequently, eternal. Meanwhile he\r\nsatisfies himself,the main point.\r\n\r\nStudents of metaphysics have of late years defined the abuse of\r\ntheir science as the morphology of common opinion. Contemporary\r\ninvestigators, they say, have been too much occupied with\r\nintrospection; their labors have become merely\r\nphysiologico-biographical, and they have greatly neglected the\r\nstudy of averages. For, says La Rochefoucauld, _Il est plus aisé\r\nde connoître lhomme en général que de connoître un homme en\r\nparticulier_; and on so wide a subject all views must be\r\none-sided.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the fashion of Easterns. They have still to treat\r\ngreat questions _ex analogiâ universi_, instead of _ex analogiâ\r\nhominis_. They must learn the basis of sociology, the philosophic\r\nconviction that mankind should be studied, not as a congeries of\r\nindividuals, but as an organic whole. Hence the _Zeitgeist_, or\r\nhistorical evolution of the collective consciousness of the age,\r\ndespises the obsolete opinion that Society, the State, is bound\r\nby the same moral duties as the simple citizen. Hence, too, it\r\nholds that the spirit of man, being of equal and uniform\r\nsubstance, doth usually suppose and feign in nature a greater\r\nequality and uniformity than is in Truth.\r\n\r\nChristianity and Islamism have been on their trial for the last\r\neighteen and twelve centuries. They have been ardent in\r\nproselytizing, yet they embrace only one-tenth and one-twentieth\r\nof the human race. Hâjî Abdû would account for the tardy and\r\nunsatisfactory progress of what their votaries call pure\r\ntruths, by the innate imperfections of the same. Both propose a\r\nreward for mere belief, and a penalty for simple unbelief;\r\nrewards and punishments being, by the way, very disproportionate.\r\nThus they reduce everything to the scale of a somewhat unrefined\r\negotism; and their demoralizing effects become clearer to every\r\nprogressive age.\r\n\r\nHâjî Abdû seeks Truth only, truth as far as man, in the present\r\nphase of his development, is able to comprehend it. He disdains\r\nto associate utility, like Bacon (Nov. Org. I. Aph. 124), the\r\nHigh Priest of the English Creed, _le gros bon sens_, with the\r\n_lumen siccum ac purum notionum verarum_. He seems to see the\r\ninjury inflicted upon the sum of thought by the _â posteriori_\r\nsuperstition, the worship of facts, and the deification of\r\nsynthesis. Lastly, came the reckless way in which Locke freed\r\nphilosophy from the incubus of innate ideas. Like Luther and the\r\nleaders of the great French Revolution, he broke with the Past;\r\nand he threw overboard the whole cargo of human tradition. The\r\nresult has been an immense movement of the mind which we love to\r\ncall Progress, when it has often been retrograde; together with a\r\nmighty development of egotism resulting from the pampered\r\nsentiment of personality.\r\n\r\nThe Hâjî regrets the excessive importance attached to a possible\r\nfuture state: he looks upon this as a psychical stimulant, a day\r\ndream, whose revulsion and reaction disorder waking life. The\r\ncondition may appear humble and prosaic to those exalted by the\r\nfumes of Fancy, by a spiritual dram-drinking, which, like the\r\nphysical, is the pursuit of an ideal happiness. But he is too\r\nwise to affirm or to deny the existence of another world. For\r\nlife beyond the grave there is no consensus of mankind, no\r\nCatholic opinion held _semper, et ubique, et ab omnibus_. The\r\nintellectual faculties (perception and reflection) are mute upon\r\nthe subject: they bear no testimony to facts; they show no proof.\r\nEven the instinctive sense of our kind is here dumb. We may\r\nbelieve what we are taught: we can know nothing. He would,\r\ntherefore, cultivate that receptive mood which, marching under\r\nthe shadow of mighty events, leads to the highest of goals,the\r\ndevelopment of Humanity. With him suspension of judgment is a\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nMan has done much during the sixty-eight centuries which\r\nrepresent his history. This assumes the first Egyptian Empire,\r\nfollowing the pre-historic, to begin with B. C. 5000, and to end\r\nwith B. C. 3249. It was the Old, as opposed to the Middle, the\r\nNew, and the Low: it contained the Dynasties from I. to X., and\r\nit was the age of the Pyramids, at once simple, solid, and grand.\r\nWhen the praiser of the Past contends that modern civilization\r\nhas improved in nothing upon Homer and Herodotus, he is apt to\r\nforget that every schoolboy is a miracle of learning compared\r\nwith the Cave-man and the palæolithic race. And, as the Past has\r\nbeen, so shall the Future be.\r\n\r\nThe Pilgrims view of life is that of the Soofi, with the usual\r\ndash of Buddhistic pessimism. The profound sorrow of existence,\r\nso often sung by the dreamy Eastern poet, has now passed into the\r\npractical European mind. Even the light Frenchman murmurs,\r\n\r\n   Moi, moi, chaque jour courbant plus bas ma tête\r\n     Je passeet refroidi sous ce soleil joyeux,\r\n   Je men irai bientôt, au milieu de la fête,\r\n     Sans que rien manque au monde immense et radieux.\r\n\r\nBut our Hâjî is not Nihilistic in the no-nothing sense of\r\nHoods poem, or, as the American phrases it, There is nothing\r\nnew, nothing true, and it dont signify. His is a healthy wail\r\nover the shortness, and the miseries of life, because he finds\r\nall created things\r\n\r\n   Measure the world, with Me immense.\r\n\r\nHe reminds us of St. Augustine (Med. c. 21). Vita hæc, vita\r\nmisera, vita caduca, vita incerta, vita laboriosa, vita immunda,\r\nvita domina malorum, regina superborum, plena miseriis et\r\nerroribus . . . Quam humores tumidant, escæ inflant, jejunia\r\nmacerant, joci dissolvunt, tristitiæ consumunt; sollicitudo\r\ncoarctat, securitas hebetat, divitiæ inflant et jactant.\r\nPaupertas dejicit, juventus extollit, senectus incurvat,\r\nimportunitas frangit, mæror deprimit. Et his malis omnibus mors\r\nfuribunda succedit. But for _furibunda_ the Pilgrim would\r\nperhaps read _benedicta_.\r\n\r\nWith Cardinal Newman, one of the glories of our age, Hâjî Abdû\r\nfinds the Light of the world nothing else than the Prophets\r\nscroll, full of lamentations and mourning and woe. I cannot\r\nrefrain from quoting all this fine passage, if it be only for the\r\nsake of its lame and shallow deduction. To consider the world in\r\nits length and breadth, its various history and the many races of\r\nmen, their starts, their fortunes, their mutual alienation, their\r\nconflicts, and then their ways, habits, governments, forms of\r\nworship; their enterprises, their aimless courses, their random\r\nachievements and acquirements, the impotent conclusion of\r\nlong-standing facts, the tokens so faint and broken of a\r\nsuperintending design, the blind evolution (!) of what turn out\r\nto be great powers or truths, the progress of things as if from\r\nunreasoning elements, not towards final causes; the greatness and\r\nlittleness of man, his far-reaching aims and short duration. the\r\ncurtain hung over his futurity, the disappointments of life, the\r\ndefeat of good, the success of evil, physical pain, mental\r\nanguish, the prevalence and intensity of sin, the pervading\r\nidolatries, the corruptions, the dreary hopeless irreligion, that\r\ncondition of the whole race so fearfully yet exactly described in\r\nthe Apostles words, having no hope and without God in the\r\nworld_all this is a vision to dizzy and appall, and inflicts\r\nupon the mind the sense of a profound mystery which is absolutely\r\nwithout human solution_. Hence that admirable writer postulates\r\nsome terrible original calamity; and thus the hateful doctrine,\r\ntheologically called original sin, becomes to him almost as\r\ncertain as that the world exists, and as the existence of God.\r\nSimilarly the Schedule of Doctrines of the most liberal\r\nChristian Church insists upon the human depravity, and the\r\nabsolute need of the Holy Spirits agency in mans regeneration\r\nand sanctification.\r\n\r\nBut what have we here? The original calamity was either caused\r\nby God or arose without leave of God, in either case degrading\r\nGod to man. It is the old dilemma whose horns are the\r\nirreconcilable attributes of goodness and omniscience in the\r\nsupposed Creator of sin and suffering. If the one quality be\r\npredicable, the other cannot be predicable of the same subject.\r\nFar better and wiser is the essayists poetical explanation now\r\napparently despised because it was the fashionable doctrine of\r\nthe sage bards day:\r\n\r\n   All nature is but art . . .\r\n   All discord harmony not understood;\r\n   All partial evil universal good.(Essay 289292.)\r\n\r\nThe Pilgrim holds with St. Augustine Absolute Evil is impossible\r\nbecause it is always rising up into good. He considers the theory\r\nof a beneficent or maleficent deity a purely sentimental fancy,\r\ncontradicted by human reason and the aspect of the world. Evil is\r\noften the active form of good; as F. W. Newman says, so likewise\r\nis Evil the revelation of Good. With him all existences are\r\nequal: so long as they possess the Hindu Agasa, Life-fluid or\r\nvital force, it matters not they be,\r\n\r\n   Fungus or oak or worm or man.\r\n\r\nWar, he says, brings about countless individual miseries, but it\r\nforwards general progress by raising the stronger upon the ruins\r\nof the weaker races. Earthquakes and cyclones ravage small areas;\r\nbut the former builds up earth for mans habitation, and the\r\nlatter renders the atmosphere fit for him to breathe. Hence he\r\nechoes:\r\n\r\n                  The universal Cause\r\n   Acts not by partial but by general laws.\r\n\r\nAncillary to the churchmans immoral view of original sin is\r\nthe unscientific theory that evil came into the world with Adam\r\nand his seed. Let us ask what was the state of our globe in the\r\npre-Adamite days, when the tyrants of the Earth, the huge\r\nSaurians and other monsters, lived in perpetual strife, in a\r\ndestructiveness of which we have now only the feeblest examples?\r\nWhat is the actual state of the world of waters, where the only\r\nobject of life is death, where the Law of murder is the Law of\r\nDevelopment?\r\n\r\nSome will charge the Hâjî with irreverence, and hold him a\r\nlieutenant of Satan who sits in the chair of pestilence. But he\r\nis not intentionally irreverent. Like men of far higher strain,\r\nwho deny divinely the divine, he speaks the things that others\r\nthink and hide. With the author of Supernatural Religion, he\r\nholds that we gain infinitely more than we lose in abandoning\r\nbelief in the reality of revelation; and he looks forward to the\r\nday when the old tyranny shall have been broken, and when the\r\nanarchy of transition shall have passed away. But he is an\r\nEastern. When he repeats the Greeks Remember not to believe,\r\nhe means Strive to learn, to know, for right ideas lead to right\r\nactions. Among the couplets not translated for this eclogue is:\r\n\r\n   Of all the safest ways of Life\r\n      the safest way is still to doubt,\r\n   Men win the future world with Faith,\r\n      the present world they win without.\r\n\r\nThis is the Spaniards:\r\n\r\n   De las cosas mas seguras, mas seguro es duvidar;\r\n\r\na typically modern sentiment of the Brazen Age of Science\r\nfollowing the Golden Age of Sentiment. But the Pilgrim\r\ncontinues:\r\n\r\n   The sages say: I tell thee no!\r\n      with equal faith all Faiths receive;\r\n   None more, none less, for Doubt is Death:\r\n      they live the most who most believe.\r\n\r\nHere, again, is an oriental subtlety; a man who believes in\r\neverything equally and generally may be said to believe in\r\nnothing. It is not a simple European view which makes honest\r\nDoubt worth a dozen of the Creeds. And it is in direct opposition\r\nto the noted writer who holds that the man of simple faith is\r\nworth ninety-nine of those who hold only to the egotistic\r\ninterests of their own individuality. This dark saying means (if\r\nit mean anything), that the so-called moral faculties of man,\r\nfancy and ideality, must lord it over the perceptive and\r\nreflective powers,a simple absurdity! It produced a\r\nTurricremata, alias Torquemada, who, shedding floods of honest\r\ntears, caused his victims to be burnt alive; and an Anchieta, the\r\nThaumaturgist of Brazil, who beheaded a converted heretic lest\r\nthe latter by lapse from grace lose his immortal soul.\r\n\r\nBut this vein of speculation, which bigots brand as Doubt,\r\nDenial, and Destruction; this earnest religious scepticism; this\r\ncurious inquiry, Has the universal tradition any base of fact?;\r\nthis craving after the secrets and mysteries of the future, the\r\nunseen, the unknown, is common to all races and to every age.\r\nEven amongst the Romans, whose model man in Augustus day was\r\nHorace, the philosophic, the epicurean, we find Propertius\r\nasking:\r\n\r\n   An ficta in miseras descendit fabula gentes\r\n      Et timor haud ultra quam rogus esse potest?\r\n\r\nTo return: the Pilgrims doctrines upon the subject of conscience\r\nand repentance will startle those who do not follow his train of\r\nthought:\r\n\r\n   Never repent because thy will\r\n      with will of Fate be not at one:\r\n   Think, an thou please, before thou dost,\r\n      but never rue the deed when done.\r\n\r\nThis again is his modified fatalism. He would not accept the\r\nboisterous mode of cutting the Gordian-knot proposed by the noble\r\nBritish Philisterwe know were free and theres an end on it!\r\nHe prefers Lamarcks, The will is, in truth, never free. He\r\nbelieves man to be a co-ordinate term of Natures great\r\nprogression; a result of the interaction of organism and\r\nenvironment, working through cosmic sections of time. He views\r\nthe human machine, the pipe of flesh, as depending upon the\r\nphysical theory of life. Every corporeal fact and phenomenon\r\nwhich, like the tree, grows from within or without, is a mere\r\nproduct of organization; living bodies being subject to the\r\nnatural law governing the lifeless and the inorganic. Whilst the\r\nreligionist assures us that man is not a mere toy of fate, but a\r\nfree agent responsible to himself, with work to do and duties to\r\nperform, the Hâjî, with many modern schools, holds Mind to be a\r\nword describing a special operation of matter; the faculties\r\ngenerally to be manifestations of movements in the central\r\nnervous system; and every idea, even of the Deity, to be a\r\ncertain little pulsation of a certain little mass of animal\r\npap,the brain. Thus he would not object to relationship with a\r\ntailless catarrhine anthropoid ape, descended from a monad or a\r\nprimal ascidian.\r\n\r\nHence he virtually says, I came into the world without having\r\napplied for or having obtained permission; nay, more, without my\r\nleave being asked or given. Here I find myself hand-tied by\r\nconditions, and fettered by laws and circumstances, in making\r\nwhich my voice had no part. While in the womb I was an automaton;\r\nand death will find me a mere machine. Therefore not I, but the\r\nLaw, or if, you please, the Lawgiver, is answerable for all my\r\nactions. Let me here observe that to the Western mind Law\r\npostulates a Lawgiver; not so to the Eastern, and especially to\r\nthe Soofi, who holds these ideas to be human, unjustifiably\r\nextended to interpreting the non-human, which men call the\r\nDivine.\r\n\r\nFurther he would say, I am an individual (_qui nil habet\r\ndividui_), a circle touching and intersecting my neighbours at\r\ncertain points, but nowhere corresponding, nowhere blending.\r\nPhysically I am not identical in all points with other men.\r\nMorally I differ from them: in nothing do the approaches of\r\nknowledge, my five organs of sense (with their Shelleyan\r\ninterpretation), exactly resemble those of any other being.\r\n_Ergo_, the effect of the world, of life, of natural objects,\r\nwill not in my case be the same as with the beings most\r\nresembling me. Thus I claim the right of creating or modifying\r\nfor my own and private use the system which most imports me; and\r\nif the reasonable leave be refused to me, I take it without\r\nleave.\r\n\r\nBut my individuality, however all-sufficient for myself, is an\r\ninfinitesimal point, an atom subject in all things to the Law of\r\nStorms called Life. I feel, I know that Fate _is_. But I cannot\r\nknow what is or what is not fated to befall me. Therefore in the\r\npursuit of perfection as an individual lies my highest, and\r\nindeed my only duty, the I being duly blended with the We. I\r\nobject to be a selfless man, which to me denotes an inverted\r\nmoral sense. I am bound to take careful thought concerning the\r\nconsequences of every word and deed. When, however, the Future\r\nhas become the Past, it would be the merest vanity for me to\r\ngrieve or to repent over that which was decreed by universal\r\nLaw.\r\n\r\nThe usual objection is that of mans practice. It says, This is\r\nwell in theory; but how carry it out? For instance, why would you\r\nkill, or give over to be killed, the man compelled by Fate to\r\nkill your father? Hâjî Abdû replies, I do as others do, not\r\nbecause the murder was done by him, but because the murderer\r\nshould not be allowed another chance of murdering. He is a tiger\r\nwho has tasted blood and who should be shot. I am convinced that\r\nhe was a tool in the hands of Fate, but that will not prevent my\r\ntaking measures, whether predestined or not, in order to prevent\r\nhis being similarly used again.\r\n\r\nAs with repentance so with conscience. Conscience may be a fear\r\nwhich is the shadow of justice; even as pity is the shadow of\r\nlove. Though simply a geographical and chronological accident,\r\nwhich changes with every age of the world, it may deter men from\r\nseeking and securing the prize of successful villainy. But this\r\nincentive to beneficence must be applied to actions that will be\r\ndone, not to deeds that have been done.\r\n\r\nThe Hâjî, moreover, carefully distinguishes between the working\r\nof fate under a personal God, and under the Reign of Law. In the\r\nformer case the contradiction between the foreknowledge of a\r\nCreator, and the free-will of a Creature, is direct, palpable,\r\nabsolute. We might as well talk of black-whiteness and of\r\nwhite-blackness. A hundred generations of divines have never been\r\nable to ree the riddle; a million will fail. The difficulty is\r\ninsurmountable to the Theist whose Almighty is perforce\r\nOmniscient, and as Omniscient, Prescient. But it disappears when\r\nwe convert the Person into Law, or a settled order of events;\r\nsubject, moreover, to certain exceptions fixed and immutable, but\r\nat present unknown to man. The difference is essential as that\r\nbetween the penal code with its narrow forbiddal, and the broad\r\ncommandment which is a guide rather than a task-master.\r\n\r\nThus, too, the belief in fixed Law, versus arbitrary will,\r\nmodifies the Hâjîs opinions concerning the pursuit of happiness.\r\nMankind, _das rastlose Ursachenthier_, is born to be on the whole\r\nequally happy and miserable. The highest organisms, the fine\r\nporcelain of our family, enjoy the most and suffer the most: they\r\nhave a capacity for rising to the empyrean of pleasure and for\r\nplunging deep into the swift-flowing river of woe and pain. Thus\r\nDante (Inf. vi. 106):\r\n\r\n                        tua scienza\r\n   Che vuol, quanto la cosa è più perfetta\r\n   Più senta l bene, e cosi la doglienza.\r\n\r\nSo Buddhism declares that existence in itself implies effort,\r\npain and sorrow; and, the higher the creature, the more it\r\nsuffers. The common clay enjoys little and suffers little. Sum up\r\nthe whole and distribute the mass: the result will be an average;\r\nand the beggar is, on the whole, happy as the prince. Why, then,\r\nasks the objector, does man ever strive and struggle to change,\r\nto rise; a struggle which involves the idea of improving his\r\ncondition? The Hâjî answers, Because such is the Law under which\r\nman is born: it may be fierce as famine, cruel as the grave, but\r\nman must obey it with blind obedience. He does not enter into\r\nthe question whether life is worth living, whether man should\r\nelect to be born. Yet his Eastern pessimism, which contrasts so\r\nsharply with the optimism of the West, re-echoes the lines:\r\n\r\n                           a life,\r\n   With large results so little rife,\r\n   Though bearable seems hardly worth\r\n   This pomp of words, this pain of birth.\r\n\r\nLife, whatever may be its consequence, is built upon a basis of\r\nsorrow. Literature, the voice of humanity, and the verdict of\r\nmankind proclaim that all existence is a state of sadness. The\r\nphysicians of the Soul would save her melancholy from\r\ndegenerating into despair by doses of steadfast belief in the\r\npresence of God, in the assurance of Immortality, and in visions\r\nof the final victory of good. Were Hâjî Abdû a mere Theologist,\r\nhe would add that Sin, not the possibility of revolt, but the\r\nrevolt itself against conscience, is the primary form of evil,\r\nbecause it produces error, moral and intellectual. This man, who\r\nomits to read the Conscience-law, however it may differ from the\r\nSociety-law, is guilty of negligence. That man, who obscures the\r\nlight of Nature with sophistries, becomes incapable of discerning\r\nhis own truths. In both cases error, deliberately adopted, is\r\nsucceeded by suffering which, we are told, comes in justice and\r\nbenevolence as a warning, a remedy, and a chastisement.\r\n\r\nBut the Pilgrim is dissatisfied with the idea that evil\r\noriginates in the individual actions of free agents, ourselves\r\nand others. This doctrine fails to account for its\r\ncharacteristics,essentiality and universality. That creatures\r\nendowed with the mere possibility of liberty should not always\r\nchoose the Good appears natural. But that of the milliards of\r\nhuman beings who have inhabited the Earth, not one should have\r\nbeen found invariably to choose Good, proves how insufficient is\r\nthe solution. Hence no one believes in the existence of the\r\ncomplete man under the present state of things. The Hâjî rejects\r\nall popular and mythical explanation by the Fall of Adam, the\r\ninnate depravity of human nature, and the absolute perfection of\r\ncertain Incarnations, which argues their divinity. He can only\r\nwail over the prevalence of evil, assume its foundation to be\r\nerror, and purpose to abate it by unrooting that Ignorance which\r\nbears and feeds it.\r\n\r\nHis eschatology, like that of the Soofis generally, is vague\r\nand shadowy. He may lean towards the doctrine of Marc Aurelius,\r\nThe unripe grape, the ripe and the dried: all things are changes\r\nnot into nothing, but into that which is not at present. This is\r\none of the _monstruosa opinionum portenta_ mentioned by the XIXth\r\nGeneral Council, alias the First Council of the Vatican. But he\r\nonly accepts it with a limitation. He cleaves to the ethical, not\r\nto the intellectual, worship of Nature, which moderns define to\r\nbe an unscientific and imaginary synonym for the sum total of\r\nobserved phenomena. Consequently he holds to the dark and\r\ndegrading doctrines of the Materialist, the Hylotheist; in\r\nopposition to the spiritualist, a distinction far more marked in\r\nthe West than in the East. Europe draws a hard, dry line between\r\nSpirit and Matter: Asia does not.\r\n\r\nAmong us the Idealist objects to the Materialists that the latter\r\ncannot agree upon fundamental points; that they cannot define\r\nwhat is an atom; that they cannot account for the transformation\r\nof physical action and molecular motion into consciousness; and\r\n_vice versâ_, that they cannot say what matter is; and, lastly,\r\nthat Berkeley and his school have proved the existence of spirit\r\nwhile denying that of matter.\r\n\r\nThe Materialists reply that the want of agreement shows only a\r\nstudy insufficiently advanced; that man cannot describe an atom,\r\nbecause he is still an infant in science, yet there is no reason\r\nwhy his mature manhood should not pass through error and\r\nincapacity to truth and knowledge; that consciousness becomes a\r\nproperty of matter when certain conditions are present; that Hyle\r\n({Greek: hylae}) or Matter may be provisionally defined as\r\nphenomena with a substructure of their own, transcendental and\r\neternal, subject to the action, direct or indirect, of the five\r\nsenses, whilst its properties present themselves in three states,\r\nthe solid, the liquid, and the gaseous. To casuistical Berkeley\r\nthey prefer the common sense of mankind. They ask the idealist\r\nand the spiritualist why they cannot find names for themselves\r\nwithout borrowing from a dark and degraded school; why the\r\nformer must call himself after his eye (_idein_); the latter\r\nafter his breath (_spiritus_)? Thus the Hâjî twits them with\r\naffixing their own limitations to their own Almighty Power, and,\r\nas Socrates said, with bringing down Heaven to the market-place.\r\n\r\nModern thought tends more and more to reject crude idealism and\r\nto support the monistic theory, the double aspect, the\r\ntransfigured realism. It discusses the Nature of Things in\r\nThemselves. To the question, is there anything outside of us\r\nwhich corresponds with our sensations? that is to say, is the\r\nwhole world simply I, they reply that obviously there is a\r\nsomething else; and that this something else produces the\r\nbrain-disturbance which is called sensation. Instinct orders us\r\nto do something; Reason (the balance of faculties) directs; and\r\nthe strongest motive controls. Modern Science, by the discovery\r\nof Radiant Matter, a fourth condition, seems to conciliate the\r\ntwo schools. La découverte dun quatrième état de la matière,\r\nsays a Reviewer, cest la porte ouverte à linfini de ses\r\ntransformations; cest lhomme invisible et impalpable de même\r\npossible sans cesser dêtre substantiel; cest le monde des\r\nesprits entrant sans absurdité dans la domaine des hypothèses\r\nscientifiques; cest la possibilité pour le matérialiste de\r\ncroire à la vie doutre tombe, sans renoncer au substratum\r\nmatériel quil croit nécessaire au maintien de lindividualité.\r\n\r\nWith Hâjî Abdû the soul is not material, for that would be a\r\ncontradiction of terms. He regards it, with many moderns, as a\r\nstate of things, not a thing; a convenient word denoting the\r\nsense of personality, of individual identity. In its ghostly\r\nsignification he discovers an artificial dogma which could hardly\r\nbelong to the brutal savages of the Stone Age. He finds it in the\r\nfunereal books of ancient Egypt, whence probably it passed to the\r\nZendavesta and the Vedas. In the Hebrew Pentateuch, of which part\r\nis still attributed to Moses, it is unknown, or, rather, it is\r\ndeliberately ignored by the author or authors. The early\r\nChristians could not agree upon the subject; Origen advocated the\r\npre-existence of mens souls, supposing them to have been all\r\ncreated at one time and successively embodied. Others make Spirit\r\nborn with the hour of birth: and so forth.\r\n\r\nBut the brain-action or, if you so phrase it, the mind, is not\r\nconfined to the reasoning faculties; nor can we afford to ignore\r\nthe sentiments, the affections which are, perhaps, the most\r\npotent realities of life. Their loud affirmative voice contrasts\r\nstrongly with the titubant accents of the intellect. They seem to\r\ndemand a future life, even, a state of rewards and punishments\r\nfrom the Maker of the world, the _Ortolano Eterno_,[1] the Potter\r\nof the East, the Watchmaker of the West. They protest against the\r\nidea of annihilation. They revolt at the notion of eternal\r\nparting from parents, kinsmen and friends. Yet the dogma of a\r\nfuture life is by no means catholic and universal. The\r\nAnglo-European race apparently cannot exist without it, and we\r\nhave lately heard of the Aryan Soul-land. On the other hand\r\nmany of the Buddhist and even the Brahman Schools preach Nirwâna\r\n(comparative non-existence) and Parinirwâna (absolute\r\nnothingness). Moreover, the great Turanian family, actually\r\noccupying all Eastern Asia, has ever ignored it; and the\r\n200,000,000 of Chinese Confucians, the mass of the nation,\r\nprotest emphatically against the mainstay of the western creeds,\r\nbecause it unfits men for the business and duty of life by\r\nfixing their speculations on an unknown world. And even its\r\nvotaries, in all ages, races and faiths, cannot deny that the\r\nnext world is a copy, more or less idealized, of the present; and\r\nthat it lacks a single particular savouring of originality. It is\r\nin fact a mere continuation; and the continuation is not\r\nproven.\r\n\r\n   It is most hard to be a man;\r\n\r\nand the Pilgrims sole consolation is in self-cultivation, and in\r\nthe pleasures of the affections. This sympathy may be an indirect\r\nself-love, a reflection of the light of egotism: still it is so\r\ntransferred as to imply a different system of convictions. It\r\nrequires a different name: to call benevolence self-love is to\r\nmake the fruit or flower not only depend upon a root for\r\ndevelopment (which is true), but the very root itself (which is\r\nfalse). And, finally, his ideal is of the highest: his praise is\r\nreserved for:\r\n\r\n                          Lives\r\n   Lived in obedience to the inner law\r\n   Which cannot alter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The Eternal Gardener: so the old inscription saying:\r\n\r\n         locatus est in\r\nHomo     damnatus est in     horto\r\n         humatus est in\r\n         renatus est in\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE II\r\n\r\n\r\nA few words concerning the Kasîdah itself. Our Hâjî begins with a\r\n_mise-en-scène_; and takes leave of the Caravan setting out for\r\nMecca. He sees the Wolfs tail (_Dum-i-gurg_), the {Greek:\r\nlykaugés}, or wolf-gleam, the Diluculum, the Zodiacal dawn-light,\r\nthe first faint brushes of white radiating from below the Eastern\r\nhorizon. It is accompanied by the morning-breath (_Dam-i-Subh_),\r\nthe current of air, almost imperceptible except by the increase\r\nof cold, which Moslem physiologists suppose to be the early\r\nprayer offered by Nature to the First Cause. The Ghoul-i-Biyâbân\r\n(Desert-Demon) is evidently the personification of mans fears\r\nand of the dangers that surround travelling in the wilds. The\r\nwold-where-none-save-He (Allah)-can-dwell is a great and\r\nterrible wilderness (_Dasht-i-lâ-siwâ Hu_); and Allahs Holy Hill\r\nis Arafât, near Mecca, which the Caravan reaches after passing\r\nthrough Medina. The first section ends with a sore lament that\r\nthe meetings of this world take place upon the highway of\r\nSeparation; and the original also has:\r\n\r\n   The chill of sorrow numbs my thought:\r\n      methinks I hear the passing knell;\r\n   As dies across yon thin blue line\r\n      the tinkling of the Camel-bell.\r\n\r\nThe next section quotes the various aspects under which Life\r\nappeared to the wise and foolish teachers of humanity. First\r\ncomes Hafiz, whose well-known lines are quoted beginning with\r\nShab-i-târîk o bîm-i-mauj, etc. Hûr is the plural of Ahwar, in\r\nfull Ahwar el-Ayn, a maid whose eyes are intensely white where\r\nthey should be white, and black elsewhere: hence our silly\r\nHouries. Follows Umar-i-Khayyâm, who spiritualized Tasawwof, or\r\nSooffeism, even as the Soofis (Gnostics) spiritualized Moslem\r\nPuritanism. The verses alluded to are:\r\n\r\n   You know, my friends, with what a brave carouse\r\n   I made a second marriage in my house,\r\n      Divorced old barren Reason from my bed\r\n   And took the Daughter of the Vine to spouse.\r\n            (St. 60, Mr. Fitzgeralds translation.)\r\n\r\nHere Wine is used in its mystic sense of entranced Love for the\r\nSoul of Souls. Umar was hated and feared because he spoke boldly\r\nwhen his brethren the Soofis dealt in innuendoes. A third\r\nquotation has been trained into a likeness of the Hymn of Life,\r\ndespite the commonplace and the _navrante vulgarité_ which\r\ncharacterize the pseudo-Schiller-Anglo-American School. The same\r\nhas been done to the words of Isâ (Jesus); for the author, who is\r\nwell-read in the Ingîl (Evangel), evidently intended the\r\nallusion. Mansur el-Hallâj (the Cotton-Cleaner) was stoned for\r\ncrudely uttering the Pantheistic dogma _Ana l Hakk_ (I am the\r\nTruth, _i.e._, God), _wa laysa fi-jubbatî il Allah_ (and within\r\nmy coat is nought but God). His blood traced on the ground the\r\nfirst-quoted sentence. Lastly, there is a quotation from\r\nSardanapalus, son of Anacyndaraxes, etc.: here {Greek: paîze}\r\nmay mean sport; but the context determines the kind of sport\r\nintended. The Zâhid is the literal believer in the letter of the\r\nLaw, opposed to the Soofi, who believes in its spirit: hence the\r\nformer is called a Zâhiri (outsider), and the latter a Bâtini, an\r\ninsider. Moses is quoted because he ignored future rewards and\r\npunishments. As regards the two Eternities, Persian and Arab\r\nmetaphysicians split Eternity, _i.e._, the negation of Time, into\r\ntwo halves, _Azal_ (beginninglessness) and _Abad_ (endlessness);\r\nboth being mere words, gatherings of letters with a subjective\r\nsignificance. In English we use Eternal (_Æviternus_, age-long,\r\nlife-long) as loosely, by applying it to three distinct ideas;\r\n(1) the habitual, in popular parlance; (2) the exempt from\r\nduration; and (3) the everlasting, which embraces all duration.\r\nOmniscience-Maker is the old Roman sceptics _Homo fecit Deos_.\r\n\r\nThe next section is one long wail over the contradictions, the\r\nmysteries, the dark end, the infinite sorrowfulness of all\r\nexistence, and the arcanum of grief which, Luther said, underlies\r\nall life. As with Euripides to live is to die, to die is to\r\nlive. Hâjî Abdû borrows the Hindu idea of the human body. It is\r\na mansion, says Menu, with bones for its beams and rafters;\r\nwith nerves and tendons for cords; with muscles and blood for\r\ncement; with skin for its outer covering; filled with no sweet\r\nperfume, but loaded with impurities; a mansion infested by age\r\nand sorrow; the seat of malady; harassed with pains; haunted with\r\nthe quality of darkness (Tama-guna), and incapable of standing.\r\nThe Pot and Potter began with the ancient Egyptians. Sitting as\r\na potter at the wheel, Cneph (at Philæ) moulds clay, and gives\r\nthe spirit of life to the nostrils of Osiris. Hence the\r\nGenesitic breath. Then we meet him in the Vedas, the Being by\r\nwhom the fictile vase is formed; the clay out of which it is\r\nfabricated. We find him next in Jeremiahs Arise and go down\r\nunto the Potters house, etc. (xviii. 2), and lastly in Romans\r\n(ix. 20), Hath not the potter power over the clay? No wonder\r\nthat the first Hand who moulded the man-mud is a _lieu commun_ in\r\nEastern thought. The waste of agony is Buddhism, or\r\nSchopenhauerism pure and simple, I have moulded Earth on Earth\r\nupon Seint Ysidres well-known rhymes (A.D. 1440):\r\n\r\n   Erthe out of Erthe is wondirli wrouzt,\r\n   Erthe out of Erthe hath gete a dignity of nouzt,\r\n   Erthe upon Erthe hath sett all his thouzt\r\n   How that Erthe upon Erthe may be his brouzt, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Camel-rider, suggests Ossian, yet a few years and the\r\nblast of the desert comes. The dromedary was chosen as Deaths\r\nvehicle by the Arabs, probably because it bears the Bedouins\r\ncorpse to the distant burial-ground, where he will lie among his\r\nkith and kin. The end of this section reminds us of:\r\n\r\n   How poor, how rich; how abject, how august,\r\n   How complicate, how wonderful is Man!\r\n\r\nThe Hâjî now passes to the results of his long and anxious\r\nthoughts: I have purposely twisted his exordium into an echo of\r\nMilton:\r\n\r\n   Till old experience doth attain\r\n   To something of prophetic strain.\r\n\r\nHe boldly declares that there is no God as man has created his\r\nCreator. Here he is at one with modern thought:En général les\r\ncroyants font le Dieu comme ils sont eux-mêmes, (says J. J.\r\nRousseau, Confessions, I. 6): les bons le font bon: les\r\nméchants le font méchant: les dévots haineux et bilieux, ne\r\nvoient que lenfer, parce quils voudraient damner tout le monde;\r\nles âmes aimantes et douces ny croient guère; et lun des\r\nétonnements dont je ne reviens pas est de voir le bon Fénélon en\r\nparler dans son Télémaque comme sil y croyoit tout de bon: mais\r\njespère quil mentoit alors; car enfin quelque véridique quon\r\nsoit, il faut bien mentir quelquefois quand on est évêque. Man\r\ndepicts himself in his gods, says Schiller. Hence the\r\n_Naturgott_, the deity of all ancient peoples, and with which\r\nevery system began, allowed and approved of actions distinctly\r\nimmoral, often diabolical. Belief became moralized only when the\r\nconscience of the community, and with it of the individual items,\r\nbegan aspiring to its golden age,Perfection. Dieu est le\r\nsuperlatif, dont le positif est lhomme, says Carl Vogt;\r\nmeaning, that the popular idea of a _numen_ is that of a\r\nmagnified and non-natural man.\r\n\r\nHe then quotes his authorities. Buddha, whom the Catholic Church\r\nconverted to Saint Josaphat, refused to recognize Ishwara (the\r\ndeity), on account of the mystery of the cruelty of things.\r\nSchopenhauer, Miss Cobbes model pessimist, who at the humblest\r\ndistance represents Buddha in the world of Western thought, found\r\nthe vision of mans unhappiness, irrespective of his actions, so\r\noverpowering that he concluded the Supreme Will to be malevolent,\r\nheartless, cowardly, and arrogant. Confucius, the Throneless\r\nking, more powerful than all kings, denied a personal deity. The\r\nEpicurean idea rules the China of the present day. God is great,\r\nbut he lives too far off, say the Turanian Santâls in Aryan\r\nIndia; and this is the general language of man in the Turanian\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nHâjî Abdû evidently holds that idolatry begins with a personal\r\ndeity. And let us note that the latter is deliberately denied by\r\nthe Thirty-nine Articles. With them God is a Being without\r\nParts (personality) or Passions. He professes a vague\r\nAgnosticism, and attributes popular faith to the fact that Timor\r\nfecit Deos; every religion being, without exception, the child\r\nof fear and ignorance (Carl Vogt). He now speaks as the Drawer\r\nof the Wine, the Ancient Taverner, the Old Magus, the\r\nPatron of the Mughân or Magians; all titles applied to the\r\nSoofi as opposed to the Zâhid. His idols are the eidola\r\n(illusions) of Bacon, having their foundations in the very\r\nconstitution of man, and therefore appropriately called\r\n_fabulæ_. That Natures Common Course is subject to various\r\ninterpretation, may be easily proved. Aristotle was as great a\r\nsubverter as Alexander; but the quasi-prophetical Stagyrite of\r\nthe Dark Ages, who ruled the world till the end of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, became the twice execrable of Martin Luther; and was\r\nfinally abolished by Galileo and Newton. Here I have excised two\r\nstanzas. The first is:\r\n\r\n   Theories for truths, fable for fact;\r\n      system for science vex the thought\r\n   Lifes one great lesson you despise\r\n      to know that all we know is nought.\r\n\r\nThis is in fact:\r\n\r\n   Well didst thou say, Athenas noblest son,\r\n   The most we know is nothing can be known.\r\n\r\nThe next is:\r\n\r\n   Essence and substance, sequence, cause,\r\n      beginning, ending, space and time,\r\n   These be the toys of manhoods mind,\r\n      at once ridiculous and sublime.\r\n\r\nHe is not the only one who so regards bothering Time and Space.\r\nA late definition of the infinitely great, viz., that the idea\r\narises from denying form to any figure; of the infinitely\r\nsmall, from refusing magnitude to any figure, is a fair specimen\r\nof the dismal sciencemetaphysics.\r\n\r\nAnother omitted stanza reads:\r\n\r\n   How canst thou, Phenomen! pretend\r\n      the Noumenon to mete and span?\r\n   Say which were easier probed and proved,\r\n      Absolute Being or mortal man?\r\n\r\nOne would think that he had read Kant on the Knowable and the\r\nUnknowable, or had heard of the Yankee lady, who could\r\ndifferentiate between the Finite and the Infinite. It is a\r\ncommon-place of the age, in the West as well as the East, that\r\nScience is confined to phenomena, and cannot reach the Noumena,\r\nthe things themselves. This is the scholastic realism, the\r\nresiduum of a bad metaphysic, which deforms the system of\r\nComte. With all its pretensions, it simply means that there are,\r\nor can be conceived, things in themselves (_i.e._, unrelated to\r\nthought); that we know them to exist; and, at the same time, that\r\nwe cannot know what they are. But who dares say cannot? Who can\r\nmeasure mans work when he shall be as superior to our present\r\nselves as we are to the Cave-man of past time?\r\n\r\nThe Chain of Universe alludes to the Jain idea that the whole,\r\nconsisting of intellectual as well as of natural principles,\r\nexisted from all eternity; and that it has been subject to\r\nendless revolutions, whose causes are the inherent powers of\r\nnature, intellectual as well as physical, without the\r\nintervention of a deity. But the Poet ridicules the non-human,\r\n_i.e._, the not-ourselves, the negation of ourselves and\r\nconsequently a non-existence. Most Easterns confuse the\r\ncontradictories, in which one term stands for something, and the\r\nother for nothing (_e.g._, ourselves and not-ourselves), with the\r\ncontraries (_e.g._, rich and not-rich = poor), in which both\r\nterms express a something. So the positive-negative infinite is\r\nnot the complement of finite, but its negation. The Western man\r\nderides the process by making not-horse the complementary\r\nentity of horse. The Pilgrim ends with the favourite Soofi\r\ntenet that the five (six?) senses are the doors of all human\r\nknowledge, and that no form of man, incarnation of the deity,\r\nprophet, apostle or sage, has ever produced an idea not conceived\r\nwithin his brain by the sole operation of these vulgar material\r\nagents. Evidently he is neither spiritualist nor idealist.\r\n\r\nHe then proceeds to show that man depicts himself in his God, and\r\nthat God is the racial expression; a pedagogue on the Nile, an\r\nabstraction in India, and an astrologer in Chaldæa; where\r\nAbraham, says Berosus (Josephus, Ant. I. 7, § 2, and II. 9, § 2)\r\nwas skilful in the celestial science. He notices the\r\nAkârana-Zamân (endless Time) of the Guebres, and the working\r\ndual, Hormuzd and Ahriman. He brands the God of the Hebrews with\r\npugnacity and cruelty. He has heard of the beautiful creations of\r\nGreek fancy which, not attributing a moral nature to the deity,\r\nincluded Theology in Physics; and which, like Professor Tyndall,\r\nseemed to consider all matter everywhere alive. We have adopted a\r\nvery different Unitarianism; Theology, with its one Creator;\r\nPantheism with its one Spirits plastic stress; and Science\r\nwith its one Energy. He is hard upon Christianity and its trinal\r\nGod: I have not softened his expression ({Arabic} = a riddle),\r\nalthough it may offend readers. There is nothing more enigmatical\r\nto the Moslem mind than Christian Trinitarianism: all other\r\nobjections they can get over, not this. Nor is he any lover of\r\nIslamism, which, like Christianity, has its ascetic Hebraism and\r\nits Hellenic hedonism; with the world of thought moving between\r\nthese two extremes. The former, defined as predominant or\r\nexclusive care for the practice of right, is represented by\r\nSemitic and Arab influence, Korânic and Hadîsic. The latter, the\r\nreligion of humanity, a passion for life and light, for culture\r\nand intelligence; for art, poetry and science, is represented in\r\nIslamism by the fondly and impiously-cherished memory of the old\r\nGuebre kings and heroes, beauties, bards and sages. Hence the\r\nmention of Zâl and his son Rostam; of Cyrus and of the\r\nJâm-i-Jamshîd, which may be translated either grail (cup) or\r\nmirror: it showed the whole world within its rim; and hence it\r\nwas called Jâm-i-Jehân-numâ (universe-exposing). The contemptuous\r\nexpressions about the diet of camels milk and the meat of the\r\nSusmâr, or green lizard, are evidently quoted from Firdausis\r\nfamous lines beginning:\r\n\r\n   Arab-râ be-jâî rasîdest kâr.\r\n\r\nThe Hâjî is severe upon those who make of the Deity a\r\nKhwân-i-yaghmâ (or tray of plunder) as the Persians phrase it. He\r\nlooks upon the shepherds as men,\r\n\r\n   Who rob the sheep themselves to clothe.\r\n\r\nSo Schopenhauer (Leben, etc., by Wilhelm Gewinner) furiously\r\nshows how the English nation ought to treat that set of\r\nhypocrites, imposters and money-graspers, the clergy, that\r\nannually devours £3,500,000.\r\n\r\nThe Hâjî broadly asserts that there is no Good and no Evil in the\r\nabsolute sense as man has made them. Here he is one with Pope:\r\n\r\n   And spite of pride, in erring natures spite\r\n   One truth is clearwhatever is, is right.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the converse is just as true:whatever is, is\r\nwrong. Khizr is the Elijah who puzzled Milman. He represents the\r\nSoofi, the Bâtini, while Musâ (Moses) is the Zâhid, the Zâhiri;\r\nand the strange adventures of the twain, invented by the Jews,\r\nhave been appropriated by the Moslems. He derides the Freewill of\r\nman; and, like Diderot, he detects pantaloon in a prelate, a\r\nsatyr in a president, a pig in a priest, an ostrich in a\r\nminister, and a goose in a chief clerk. He holds to Fortune, the\r\n{Greek: Túxae} of Alcman, which is, {Greek: Eunomías te kaì\r\nPeithoûs adelphà kaì Promatheías thugátaer},Chance, the sister\r\nof Order and Trust, and the daughter of Forethought. The\r\nScandinavian Spinners of Fate were Urd (the Was, the Past),\r\nVerdandi (the Becoming, or Present), and Skuld (the To-be, or\r\nFuture). He alludes to Plato, who made the Demiourgos create the\r\nworlds by the Logos (the Hebrew Dabar) or Creative Word, through\r\nthe Æons. These {Greek: Aìwnes} of the Mystics were spiritual\r\nemanations from {Greek: Aìwn}, lit. a wave of influx, an age,\r\nperiod, or day; hence the Latin _ævum_, and the Welsh Awen, the\r\nstream of inspiration falling upon a bard. Basilides, the\r\nEgypto-Christian, made the Creator evolve seven Æons or Pteromata\r\n(fulnesses); from two of whom, Wisdom and Power, proceeded the\r\n365 degrees of Angels. All were subject to a Prince of Heaven,\r\ncalled Abraxas, who was himself under guidance of the chief Æon,\r\nWisdom. Others represent the first Cause to have produced an Æon\r\nor Pure Intelligence; the first a second, and so forth till the\r\ntenth. This was material enough to affect Hyle, which thereby\r\nassumed a spiritual form. Thus the two incompatibles combined in\r\nthe Scheme of Creation.\r\n\r\nHe denies the three ages of the Buddhists: the wholly happy; the\r\nhappy mixed with misery, and the miserable tinged with\r\nhappiness,the present. The Zoroastrians had four, each of 3,000\r\nyears. In the first, Hormuzd, the good-god, ruled alone; then\r\nAhriman, the bad-god, began to rule subserviently: in the third\r\nboth ruled equally; and in the last, now current, Ahriman has\r\ngained the day.\r\n\r\nAgainst the popular idea that man has caused the misery of this\r\nworld, he cites the ages, when the Old Red Sandstone bred\r\ngigantic cannibal fishes; when the Oolites produced the mighty\r\nreptile tyrants of air, earth, and sea; and when the monsters of\r\nthe Eocene and Miocene periods shook the ground with their\r\nponderous tread. And the world of waters is still a hideous scene\r\nof cruelty, carnage, and destruction.\r\n\r\nHe declares Conscience to be a geographical and chronological\r\naccident. Thus he answers the modern philosopher whose soul was\r\noverwhelmed by the marvel and the awe of two things, the starry\r\nheaven above and the moral law within. He makes the latter sense\r\na development of the gregarious and social instincts; and so\r\ntravellers have observed that the moral is the last step in\r\nmental progress. His Moors are the savage Dankali and other\r\nnegroid tribes, who offer a cup of milk with one hand and stab\r\nwith the other. He translates literally the Indian word Hâthî (an\r\nelephant), the animal with the Hâth (hand, or trunk). Finally he\r\nalludes to the age of active volcanoes, the present, which is\r\nmerely temporary, the shifting of the Pole, and the spectacle to\r\nbe seen from Mushtari, or the planet Jupiter.\r\n\r\nThe Hâjî again asks the old, old question, What is Truth? And he\r\nanswers himself, after the fashion of the wise Emperor of China,\r\nTruth hath not an unchanging name. A modern English writer\r\nsays: I have long been convinced by the experience of my life,\r\nas a pioneer of various heterodoxies, which are rapidly becoming\r\northodoxies, that nearly all truth is temperamental to us, or\r\ngiven in the affections and intuitions; and that discussion and\r\ninquiry do little more than feed temperament. Our poet seems to\r\nmean that the Perceptions, when they perceive truly, convey\r\nobjective truth, which is universal; whereas the Reflectives and\r\nthe Sentiments, the working of the moral region, or the middle\r\nlobe of the phrenologists, supplies only subjective truth,\r\npersonal and individual. Thus to one man the axiom, _Opes\r\nirritamenta malorum_, represents a distinct fact; while another\r\nholds wealth to be an incentive for good. Evidently both are\r\nright, according to their lights.\r\n\r\nHâjî Abdû cites Plato and Aristotle, as usual with Eastern\r\nsongsters, who delight in Mantik (logic). Here he appears to mean\r\nthat a false proposition is as real a proposition as one that is\r\ntrue. Faith moves mountains and Manet immota fides are\r\nevidently quotations. He derides the teaching of the First\r\nCouncil of the Vatican (cap. v.), all the faithful are little\r\nchildren listening to the voice of Saint Peter, who is the\r\nPrince of the Apostles. He glances at the fancy of certain\r\nmodern physicists, devotion is a definite molecular change in\r\nthe convolution of grey pulp. He notices with contumely the\r\nriddle of which Milton speaks so glibly, where the Dialoguists,\r\n\r\n                              reasoned high\r\n   Of providence, foreknowledge, will and fate,\r\n   Fixed fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute.\r\n\r\nIn opposition to the orthodox Mohammedan tenets which make Mans\r\nsoul his percipient Ego, an entity, a unity, the Soofi considers\r\nit a fancy, opposed to body, which is a fact; at most a state of\r\nthings, not a thing; a consensus of faculties whereof our frames\r\nare but the phenomena. This is not contrary to Genesitic legend.\r\nThe Hebrew Ruach and Arabic Ruh, now perverted to mean soul or\r\nspirit, simply signify wind or breath, the outward and visible\r\nsign of life. Their later schools are even more explicit. For\r\nthat which befalls man befalls beasts; as the one dies, so does\r\nthe other; they have all one death; all go unto one place\r\n(Eccles. iii. 19). But the modern soul, a nothing, a string of\r\nnegations, a negative in chief, is thus described in the\r\nMahâbhârat: It is indivisible, inconceivable, inconceptible: it\r\nis eternal, universal, permanent, immovable: it is invisible and\r\nunalterable. Hence the modern spiritualism which, rejecting\r\nmaterialism, can use only material language.\r\n\r\nThese, says the Hâjî, are mere sounds. He would not assert Verba\r\ngignunt verba, but Verba gignunt res, a step further. The idea\r\nis Bacons idola fori, omnium molestissima, the twofold\r\nillusions of language; either the names of things that have no\r\nexistence in fact, or the names of things whose idea is confused\r\nand ill-defined.\r\n\r\nHe derives the Soul-idea from the savage ghost which Dr.\r\nJohnson defined to be a kind of shadowy being. He justly\r\nremarks that it arose (perhaps) in Egypt; and was not invented by\r\nthe People of the Book. By this term Moslems denote Jews and\r\nChristians who have a recognized revelation, while their\r\nignorance refuses it to Guebres, Hindus, and Confucians.\r\n\r\nHe evidently holds to the doctrine of progress. With him\r\nprotoplasm is the Yliastron, the Prima Materies. Our word matter\r\nis derived from the Sanskrit {Sanskrit} (mâtrâ), which, however,\r\nsignifies properly the invisible type of visible matter; in\r\nmodern language, the substance distinct from the sum of its\r\nphysical and chemical properties. Thus, Mâtrâ exists only in\r\nthought, and is not recognizable by the action of the five\r\nsenses. His Chain of Being reminds us of Prof. Huxleys\r\nPedigree of the Horse, Orohippus, Mesohippus, Meiohippus,\r\nProtohippus, Pleiohippus, and Equus. He has evidently heard of\r\nmodern biology, or Hylozoism, which holds its quarter-million\r\nspecies of living beings, animal and vegetable, to be progressive\r\nmodifications of one great fundamental unity, an unity of\r\nso-called mental faculties as well as of bodily structure. And\r\nthis is the jelly-speck. He scoffs at the popular idea that man\r\nis the great central figure round which all things gyrate like\r\nmarionettes; in fact, the anthropocentric era of Draper, which,\r\nstrange to say, lives by the side of the telescope and the\r\nmicroscope. As man is of recent origin, and may end at an early\r\nepoch of the macrocosm, so before his birth all things revolved\r\nround nothing, and may continue to do so after his death.\r\n\r\nThe Hâjî, who elsewhere denounces compound ignorance, holds\r\nthat all evil comes from error; and that all knowledge has been\r\ndeveloped by overthrowing error, the ordinary channel of human\r\nthought. He ends this section with a great truth. There are\r\nthings which human Reason or Instinct matured, in its undeveloped\r\nstate, cannot master; but Reason is a Law to itself. Therefore we\r\nare not bound to believe, or to attempt belief in, any thing\r\nwhich is contrary or contradictory to Reason. Here he is\r\ndiametrically opposed to Rome, who says, Do not appeal to\r\nHistory; that is private judgment. Do not appeal to Holy Writ;\r\nthat is heresy. Do not appeal to Reason; that is Rationalism.\r\n\r\nHe holds with the Patriarchs of Hebrew Holy Writ, that the\r\npresent life is all-sufficient for an intellectual (not a\r\nsentimental) being; and, therefore, that there is no want of a\r\nHeaven or a Hell. With far more contradiction the Western poet\r\nsings:\r\n\r\n   Hell hath no limits, nor is circumscribed\r\n   In one self-place; but when we are in hell,\r\n   And where hell is there must we ever be,\r\n   And, to be short, when all this world dissolves,\r\n   And every creature shall be purified,\r\n   All places shall be hell which are not heaven.\r\n\r\nFor what want is there of a Hell when all are pure? He enlarges\r\nupon the ancient Buddhist theory, that Happiness and Misery are\r\nequally distributed among men and beasts; some enjoy much and\r\nsuffer much; others the reverse. Hence Diderot declares, Sober\r\npassions produce only the commonplace . . . the man of moderate\r\npassion lives and dies like a brute. And again we have the half\r\ntruth:\r\n\r\n   That the mark of rank in nature\r\n      Is capacity for pain.\r\n\r\nThe latter implies an equal capacity for pleasure, and thus the\r\nbalance is kept.\r\n\r\nHâjî Abdû then proceeds to show that Faith is an accident of\r\nbirth. One of his omitted distichs says:\r\n\r\n   Race makes religion; true! but aye\r\n      upon the Maker acts the made,\r\n   A finite God, and infinite sin,\r\n      in lieu of raising man, degrade.\r\n\r\nIn a manner of dialogue he introduces the various races each\r\nfighting to establish its own belief. The Frank (Christian)\r\nabuses the Hindu, who retorts that he is of Mlenchha, mixed or\r\nimpure, blood, a term applied to all non-Hindus. The same is done\r\nby Nazarene and Mohammedan; by the Confucian, who believes in\r\nnothing, and by the Soofi, who naturally has the last word. The\r\nassociation of the Virgin Mary and St. Joseph with the Trinity,\r\nin the Roman and Greek Churches, makes many Moslems conclude that\r\nChristians believe not in three but in five Persons. So an\r\nEnglishman writes of the early Fathers, They not only said that\r\n3 = 1, and that 1 = 3: they professed to explain how that curious\r\narithmetical combination had been brought about. The Indivisible\r\nhad been divided, and yet was not divided: it was divisible, and\r\nyet it was indivisible; black was white and white was black; and\r\nyet there were not two colours but one colour; and whoever did\r\nnot believe it would be damned. The Arab quotation runs in the\r\noriginal:\r\n\r\n   _Ahsanu l-Makâni l il-Fatâ l-Jehannamu_\r\n   The best of places for (the generous) youth is Gehenna.\r\n\r\nGehenna, alias Jahim, being the fiery place of eternal\r\npunishment. And the second saying, _Al- nâr wa lâ l-Ar_Fire\r\n(of Hell) rather than Shame,is equally condemned by the\r\nKoranist. The Gustâkhi (insolence) of Fate is the expression of\r\nUmar-i-Khayyam (St. xxx):\r\n\r\n   What, without asking hither hurried _whence?_\r\n   And, without asking _whither_ hurried hence!\r\n      Oh many a cup of this forbidden wine\r\n   Must drown the memory of that insolence.\r\n\r\nSoofistically, the word means the coquetry of the beloved one,\r\nthe divinæ particula auræ. And the section ends with Popes:\r\n\r\n   He cant be wrong whose life is in the right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nHere the Hâjî ends his practical study of mankind. The image of\r\nDestiny playing with men as pieces is a view common amongst\r\nEasterns. His idea of wisdom is once more Popes:\r\n\r\n   And all our knowledge is ourselves to know.\r\n                                 (Essay IV. 398.)\r\n\r\nRegret, _i.e._, repentance, was one of the forty-two deadly sins\r\nof the Ancient Egyptians. Thou shalt not consume thy heart,\r\nsays the Ritual of the Dead, the negative justification of the\r\nsoul or ghost (Lepsius Alteste Texte des Todtenbuchs). We have\r\nborrowed competitive examination from the Chinese; and, in these\r\nmorbid days of weak introspection and retrospection, we might\r\nlearn wisdom from the sturdy old Khemites. When he sings Abjure\r\nthe Why and seek the How, he refers to the old Scholastic\r\ndifference of the _Demonstratio propter quid_ (why is a thing?),\r\nas opposed to _Demonstratio quia_ (_i.e._ that a thing is). The\r\ngreat Man shall end with becoming deathless, as Shakespeare\r\nsays in his noble sonnet:\r\n\r\n   And Death once dead, theres no more dying then!\r\n\r\nLike the great Pagans, the Hâjî holds that man was born good,\r\nwhile the Christian, tormented by the things divine, cleaves to\r\nthe comforting doctrine of innate sinfulness. Hence the universal\r\ntenet, that man should do good in order to gain by it here or\r\nhereafter; the enlightened selfishness, that says, Act well and\r\nget compound interest in a future state. The allusion to the\r\nTheist-word apparently means that the votaries of a personal\r\nDeity must believe in the absolute foreknowledge of the\r\nOmniscient in particulars as in generals. The Rule of Law\r\nemancipates man; and its exceptions are the gaps left by his\r\nignorance. The wail over the fallen flower, etc., reminds us of\r\nthe Pulambal (Lamentations) of the Anti-Brahminical writer,\r\nPathira-Giriyâr. The allusion to Mâyâ is from Dâs Kabîr:\r\n\r\n      Mâyâ mare, na man mare, mar mar gayâ, sarîr.\r\n   Illusion dies, the mind dies not though dead and gone\r\n      the flesh.\r\n\r\nNirwâna, I have said, is partial extinction by being merged in\r\nthe Supreme, not to be confounded with Pari-nirwâna or absolute\r\nannihilation. In the former also, dying gives birth to a new\r\nbeing, the embodiment of _karma_ (deeds), good and evil, done in\r\nthe countless ages of transmigration.\r\n\r\nHere ends my share of the work. On the whole it has been\r\nconsiderable. I have omitted, as has been seen, sundry stanzas,\r\nand I have changed the order of others. The text has nowhere been\r\ntranslated verbatim; in fact, a familiar European turn has been\r\ngiven to many sentiments which were judged too Oriental. As the\r\nmetre adopted by Hâjî Abdû was the Bahr Tawîl (long verse), I\r\nthought it advisable to preserve that peculiarity, and to fringe\r\nit with the rough, unobtrusive rhyme of the original.\r\n\r\nVive, valeque!",
