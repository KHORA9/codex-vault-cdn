What is more accidental than reputation?\r\n     What may be done to-morrow, may be done to-day\r\n     What more?  they lie with their lovers learnedly\r\n     What need have they of anything but to live beloved and honoured\r\n     What sort of wine he liked the best: “That of another”\r\n      What step ends the near and what step begins the remote\r\n     What they ought to do when they come to be men\r\n     What we have not seen, we are forced to receive from other hands\r\n     What, shall so much knowledge be lost\r\n     Whatever was not ordinary diet, was instead of a drug\r\n     When I travel I have nothing to care for but myself\r\n     When jealousy seizes these poor souls\r\n     When their eyes give the lie to their tongue\r\n     When time begins to wear things out of memory\r\n     When we have got it, we want something else\r\n     “When will this man be wise,” said he, “if he is yet learning?”\r\n      When you see me moved first, let me alone, right or wrong\r\n     Where the lion’s skin is too short\r\n     Where their profit is, let them there have their pleasure too\r\n     Wherever the mind is perplexed, it is in an entire disorder\r\n     Whilst thou wast silent, thou seemedst to be some great thing\r\n     Whimpering is offensive to the living and vain to the dead\r\n     Who by their fondness of some fine sounding word\r\n     Who can  flee from himself\r\n     Who discern no riches but in pomp and show\r\n     Who does not boast of some rare recipe\r\n     Who escapes being talked of at the same rate\r\n     Who ever saw one physician approve of another’s prescription\r\n     Who has once been a very fool, will never after be very wise\r\n     Who would weigh him without the honour and grandeur of his end\r\n     Whoever expects punishment already suffers it\r\n     Whoever will be cured of ignorance must confess it\r\n     Whoever will call to mind the excess of his past anger\r\n     Whosoever despises his own life, is always master\r\n     Why do we not imitate the Roman architecture?\r\n     Wide of the mark in judging of their own works\r\n     Willingly give them leave to laugh after we are dead\r\n     Willingly slip the collar of command upon any pretence whatever\r\n     Wisdom has its excesses, and has no less need of moderation\r\n     Wisdom is folly that does not accommodate itself to the common\r\n     Wise man lives as long as he ought, not so long as he can\r\n     Wise man never loses anything if he have himself\r\n     Wise man to keep a curbing hand upon the impetus of friendship\r\n     Wise may learn more of fools, than fools can of the wise\r\n     Wise whose invested money is visible in beautiful villas\r\n     Wiser who only know what is needful for them to know\r\n     With being too well I am about to die\r\n     Woman who goes to bed to a man, must put off her modesty\r\n     Women who paint, pounce, and plaster up their ruins\r\n     Wont to give others their life, and not to receive it\r\n     World where loyalty of one’s own children is unknown\r\n     Worse endure an ill-contrived robe than an ill-contrived mind\r\n     Would have every one in his party blind or a blockhead\r\n     Would in this affair have a man a little play the servant\r\n     Wrangling arrogance, wholly believing and trusting in itself\r\n     Wretched and dangerous thing to depend upon others\r\n     Write what he knows, and as much as he knows, but no more\r\n     Wrong the just side when they go about to assist it with fraud\r\n     Yet at least for ambition’s sake, let us reject ambition\r\n     Yet do we find any end of the need of interpretating?\r\n     You and companion are theatre enough to one another\r\n     You have lost a good captain, to make of him a bad general\r\n     You may indeed make me die an ill death\r\n     You must first see us die\r\n     You must let yourself down to those with whom you converse\r\n     Young and old die upon the same terms\r\n     Young are to make their preparations, the old to enjoy them",
