Exposition of the Conception of Ethics\r\nII. Exposition of the Notion of an End which is also a Duty\r\nREMARK\r\nIII. Of the Reason for conceiving an End which is also a Duty\r\nIV. What are the Ends which are also Duties?\r\nV. Explanation of these two Notions\r\nA. OUR OWN PERFECTION\r\nB. HAPPINESS OF OTHERS\r\nVI. Ethics does not supply Laws for Actions (which is done by Jurisprudence), but only for the Maxims of Action\r\nVII. Ethical Duties are of indeterminate, Juridical Duties of strict, Obligation\r\nVIII. Exposition of the Duties of Virtue as Intermediate Duties\r\n(1) OUR OWN PERFECTION as an end which is also a duty\r\n(2) HAPPINESS OF OTHERS as an end which is also a duty\r\nIX. What is a Duty of Virtue?\r\nX. The Supreme Principle of Jurisprudence was Analytical; that of Ethics is Synthetical\r\nXI. According to the preceding Principles, the Scheme of Duties of Virtue may be thus exhibited\r\nXII. Preliminary Notions of the Susceptibility of the Mind for Notions of Duty generally\r\nA.

Bishop Of Ossory\r\nCONTENTS\r\nEditor's Introduction \txi\r\nPreface \t1\r\nIntroduction \t7\r\nI. \tOf the division of Philosophy \t7\r\nII. \tOf the realm of Philosophy in general \t11\r\nIII. \tOf the Critique of Judgement as a means of combining the two parts of Philosophy into a whole \t14\r\nIV. \tOf Judgement as a faculty legislating a priori \t17\r\nV. \tThe principle of the formal purposiveness of nature is a transcendental principle of Judgement \t20\r\nVI. \tOf the combination of the feeling of pleasure with the concept of the purposiveness of nature \t27\r\nVII. \tOf the aesthetical representation of the purposiveness of nature \t30\r\nVIII. \tOf the logical representation of the purposiveness of nature \t35\r\nIX. \tOf the connexion of the legislation of Understanding with that of Reason by means of the Judgement \t39\r\nFirst Part.�Critique of the Aesthetical Judgement \t43\r\nFirst Division.�Analytic of the Aesthetical Judgement \t45\r\nFirst Book.�Analytic of the Beautiful \t45\r\nFirst Moment of the judgement of taste, according to quality \t45\r\n� ?1. \tThe judgement of taste is aesthetical \t45\r\n� ?2. \tThe satisfaction which determines the judgement of taste is disinterested \t46\r\n� ?3. \tThe satisfaction in the pleasant is bound up with interest \t48\r\n� ?4. \tThe satisfaction in the good is bound up with interest \t50\r\n� ?5. \tComparison of the three specifically different kinds of satisfaction \t53vi\r\nSecond Moment of the judgement of taste, viz. according to quantity \t55\r\n� ?6. \tThe Beautiful is that which apart from concepts is represented as the object of a universal satisfaction \t55\r\n� ?7. \tComparison of the Beautiful with the Pleasant and the Good by means of the above characteristic \t57\r\n� ?8. \tThe universality of the satisfaction is represented in a judgement of Taste only as subjective \t59\r\n� ?9. \tInvestigation of the question whether in a judgement of taste the feeling of pleasure precedes or follows the judging of the object \t63\r\nThird Moment of judgements of taste according to the relation of the purposes which are brought into consideration therein \t67\r\n� 10. \tOf purposiveness in general \t67\r\n� 11. \tThe judgement of taste has nothing at its basis but the form of the purposiveness of an object (or of its mode of representation) \t69\r\n� 12. \tThe judgement of taste rests on a priori grounds \t70\r\n� 13. \tThe pure judgement of taste is independent of charm and emotion \t72\r\n� 14. \tElucidation by means of examples \t73\r\n� 15. \tThe judgement of taste is quite independent of the concept of perfection \t77\r\n� 16. \tThe judgement of taste, by which an object is declared to be beautiful under the condition of a definite concept, is not pure \t81\r\n� 17. \tOf the Ideal of Beauty \t84\r\nFourth Moment of the judgement of taste, according to the modality of the satisfaction in the object \t91\r\n� 18. \tWhat the modality in a judgement of taste is \t91\r\n� 19. \tThe subjective necessity which we ascribe to the judgement of taste is conditioned \t92\r\n� 20. \tThe condition of necessity which a judgement of taste asserts is the Idea of a common sense \t92\r\n� 21. \tHave we ground for presupposing a common sense? \t93\r\n� 22. \tThe necessity of the universal agreement that is thought in a judgement of taste is a subjective necessity, which is represented as objective under the presupposition of a common sense \t94\r\nGeneral remark on the first section of the Analytic \t96vii\r\nSecond Book.�Analytic of the Sublime \t101\r\n� 23. \tTransition from the faculty which judges of the Beautiful to that which judges of the Sublime \t101\r\n� 24. \tOf the divisions of an investigation into the feeling of the Sublime \t105\r\nA.�Of the Mathematically Sublime \t106\r\n� 25. \tExplanation of the term \"Sublime\" \t106\r\n� 26. \tOf that estimation of the magnitude of natural things which is requisite for the Idea of the Sublime \t110\r\n� 27. \tOf the quality of the satisfaction in our judgements upon the Sublime \t119\r\nB.�Of the Dynamically Sublime in Nature \t123\r\n� 28. \tOf Nature regarded as Might \t123\r\n� 29. \tOf the modality of the judgement upon the sublime in nature \t130\r\nGeneral remark upon the exposition of the aesthetical reflective Judgement \t132\r\nDeduction of [pure] aesthetical judgements \t150\r\n� 30. \tThe Deduction of aesthetical judgements on the objects of nature must not be directed to what we call Sublime in nature, but only to the Beautiful \t150\r\n� 31. \tOf the method of deduction of judgements of taste \t152\r\n� 32. \tFirst peculiarity of the judgement of taste \t154\r\n� 33. \tSecond peculiarity of the judgement of taste \t157\r\n� 34. \tThere is no objective principle of taste possible \t159\r\n� 35. \tThe principle of Taste is the subjective principle of Judgement in general \t161\r\n� 36. \tOf the problem of a Deduction of judgements of Taste \t162\r\n� 37. \tWhat is properly asserted a priori of an object in a judgement of taste \t164\r\n� 38. \tDeduction of judgements of taste \t165\r\n� 39. \tOf the communicability of a sensation \t167\r\n� 40. \tOf taste as a kind of sensus communis \t169\r\n� 41. \tOf the empirical interest in the Beautiful \t173\r\n� 42. \tOf the intellectual interest in the Beautiful \t176\r\n� 43. \tOf Art in general \t183\r\n� 44. \tOf beautiful Art \t185\r\n� 45. \tBeautiful art is an art in so far as it seems like nature \t187\r\n� 46. \tBeautiful art is the art of genius \t188\r\n� 47. \tElucidation and confirmation of the above explanation of Genius \t190viii\r\n� 48. \tOf the relation of Genius to Taste \t193\r\n� 49. \tOf the faculties of the mind that constitute Genius \t197\r\n� 50. \tOf the combination of Taste with Genius in the products of beautiful Art \t205\r\n� 51. \tOf the division of the beautiful arts \t206\r\n� 52. \tOf the combination of beautiful arts in one and the same product \t214\r\n� 53. \tComparison of the respective aesthetical worth of the beautiful arts \t215\r\n� 54. \tRemark \t220\r\nSecond Division.�Dialectic of the Aesthetical Judgement \t229\r\n� 55. \t  \t229\r\n� 56. \tRepresentation of the antinomy of Taste \t230\r\n� 57. \tSolution of the antinomy of Taste \t231\r\n� 58. \tOf the Idealism of the purposiveness of both Nature and Art as the unique principle of the aesthetical Judgement \t241\r\n� 59. \tOf Beauty as the symbol of Morality \t248\r\n� 60. \tAppendix:�Of the method of Taste \t253\r\nSecond Part.�Critique of the Teleological Judgement \t257\r\n� 61. \tOf the objective purposiveness of Nature \t259\r\nFirst Division.�Analytic of the Teleological Judgement \t262\r\n� 62. \tOf the objective purposiveness which is merely formal as distinguished from that which is material \t262\r\n� 63. \tOf the relative, as distinguished from the inner, purposiveness of nature \t268\r\n� 64. \tOf the peculiar character of things as natural purposes \t272\r\n� 65. \tThings regarded as natural purposes are organised beings \t275\r\n� 66. \tOf the principle of judging of internal purposiveness in organised beings \t280\r\n� 67. \tOf the principle of the teleological judging of nature in general as a system of purposes \t282\r\n� 68. \tOf the principle of Teleology as internal principle of natural science \t287\r\nSecond Division.�Dialectic of the Teleological Judgement \t292ix\r\n� 69. \tWhat is an antinomy of the Judgement? \t292\r\n� 70. \tRepresentation of this antinomy \t293\r\n� 71. \tPreliminary to the solution of the above antinomy \t296\r\n� 72. \tOf the different systems which deal with the purposiveness of Nature \t298\r\n� 73. \tNone of the above systems give what they pretend \t302\r\n� 74. \tThe reason that we cannot treat the concept of a Technic of nature dogmatically is the fact that a natural purpose is inexplicable \t306\r\n� 75. \tThe concept of an objective purposiveness of nature is a critical principle of Reason for the reflective Judgement \t309\r\n� 76. \tRemark \t313\r\n� 77. \tOf the peculiarity of the human Understanding, by means of which the concept of a natural purpose is possible \t319\r\n� 78. \tOf the union of the principle of the universal mechanism of matter with the teleological principle in the Technic of nature \t326\r\nAppendix.�Methodology of the Teleological Judgement \t334\r\n� 79. \tWhether Teleology must be treated as if it belonged to the doctrine of nature \t334\r\n� 80. \tOf the necessary subordination of the mechanical to the teleological principle in the explanation of a thing as a natural purpose \t336\r\n� 81. \tOf the association of mechanism with the teleological principle in the explanation of a natural purpose as a natural product \t342\r\n� 82. \tOf the teleological system in the external relations of organised beings \t346\r\n� 83. \tOf the ultimate purpose of nature as a teleological system \t352\r\n� 84. \tOf the final purpose of the existence of a world, i.e. of creation itself \t359\r\n� 85. \tOf Physico-theology \t362\r\n� 86. \tOf Ethico-theology \t370x\r\n� 87. \tOf the moral proof of the Being of God \t377\r\n� 88. \tLimitation of the validity of the moral proof \t384\r\n� 89. \tOf the use of the moral argument \t392\r\n� 90. \tOf the kind of belief in a teleological proof of the Being of God \t395\r\n� 91. \tOf the kind of belief produced by a practical faith \t403\r\nGeneral remark on Teleology \t414\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERPETUAL PEACE, A PHILOSOPHICAL ESSAY\r\nBy Immanuel Kant\r\n1795\r\nTranslated With Introduction And Notes By M.
