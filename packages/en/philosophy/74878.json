Jesus Christ taught that it\r\nwas a great game of _Giving and Receiving_.\r\n\r\n“Whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap.” This means that\r\nwhatever man sends out in word or deed, will return to him; what he\r\ngives, he will receive.\r\n\r\nIf he gives hate, he will receive hate; if he gives love, he will\r\nreceive love; if he gives criticism, he will receive criticism; if he\r\nlies he will be lied to; if he cheats he will be cheated. We are taught\r\nalso, that the imaging faculty plays a leading part in the game of life.\r\n\r\n“Keep thy heart (or imagination) with all diligence, for out of it are\r\nthe issues of life.” (Prov. 4:23.)\r\n\r\nThis means that what man images, sooner or later externalizes in his\r\naffairs. I know of a man who feared a certain disease. It was a very\r\nrare disease and difficult to get, but he pictured it continually and\r\nread about it until it manifested in his body, and he died, the victim\r\nof distorted imagination.\r\n\r\nSo we see, to play successfully the game of life, we must train the\r\nimaging faculty. A person with an imaging faculty trained to image\r\nonly good, brings into his life “every righteous desire of his\r\nheart”—health, wealth, love, friends, perfect self-expression, his\r\nhighest ideals.\r\n\r\nThe imagination has been called, “_The Scissors of The Mind_,” and it\r\nis ever cutting, cutting, day by day, the pictures man sees there, and\r\nsooner or later he meets his own creations in his outer world. To train\r\nthe imagination successfully, man must understand the workings of his\r\nmind. The Greeks said: “Know Thyself.”\r\n\r\nThere are three departments of the mind, the _subconscious, conscious\r\nand superconscious_. The subconscious, is simply power, without\r\ndirection. It is like steam or electricity, and it does what it is\r\ndirected to do; it has no power of induction.\r\n\r\nWhatever man feels deeply or images clearly, is impressed upon the\r\nsubconscious mind, and carried out in minutest detail.\r\n\r\nFor example: a woman I know, when a child, always “made believe” she\r\nwas a widow. She “dressed up” in black clothes and wore a long black\r\nveil, and people thought she was very clever and amusing. She grew up\r\nand married a man with whom she was deeply in love. In a short time\r\nhe died and she wore black and a sweeping veil for many years. The\r\npicture of herself as a widow was impressed upon the subconscious mind,\r\nand in due time worked itself out, regardless of the havoc created.\r\n\r\nThe conscious mind has been called mortal or carnal mind.\r\n\r\nIt is the human mind and sees life as it _appears to be_. It sees\r\ndeath, disaster, sickness, poverty and limitation of every kind, and it\r\nimpresses the subconscious.\r\n\r\nThe _superconscious_ mind is the God Mind within each man, and is the\r\nrealm of perfect ideas.\r\n\r\nIn it, is the “_perfect pattern_” spoken of by Plato, _The Divine\r\nDesign_; for there is a _Divine Design_ for each person.\r\n\r\n“_There is a place that you are to fill and no one else can fill,\r\nsomething you are to do, which no one else can do._”\r\n\r\nThere is a perfect picture of this in the _superconscious mind_.\r\nIt usually flashes across the conscious as an unattainable\r\nideal—“something too good to be true.”\r\n\r\nIn reality it is man’s true destiny (or destination) flashed to him\r\nfrom the Infinite Intelligence which is _within himself_.\r\n\r\nMany people, however, are in ignorance of their true destinies and are\r\nstriving for things and situations which do not belong to them, and\r\nwould only bring failure and dissatisfaction if attained.\r\n\r\nFor example: A woman came to me and asked me to “speak the word” that\r\nshe would marry a certain man with whom she was very much in love. (She\r\ncalled him A. B.)\r\n\r\nI replied that this would be a violation of spiritual law, but that I\r\nwould speak the word for the right man, the “divine selection,” the man\r\nwho belonged to her by divine right.\r\n\r\nI added, “If A. B. is the right man you can’t lose him, and if he\r\nisn’t, you will receive his equivalent.” She saw A. B. frequently but\r\nno headway was made in their friendship. One evening she called, and\r\nsaid, “Do you know, for the last week, A. B. hasn’t seemed so wonderful\r\nto me.” I replied, “Maybe he is not the divine selection—another man\r\nmay be the right one.” Soon after that, she met another man who fell in\r\nlove with her at once, and who said she was his ideal. In fact, he said\r\nall the things that she had always wished A. B. would say to her.\r\n\r\nShe remarked, “It was quite uncanny.”\r\n\r\nShe soon returned his love, and lost all interest in A. B.\r\n\r\nThis shows the law of substitution. A right idea was substituted for a\r\nwrong one, therefore there was no loss or sacrifice involved.\r\n\r\nJesus Christ said, “Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and his\r\nrighteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you,” and he\r\nsaid the Kingdom _was within man_.\r\n\r\nThe Kingdom is the realm of _right ideas_, or the divine pattern.\r\n\r\nJesus Christ taught that man’s words played a leading part in the game\r\nof life. “By your words ye are justified and by your words ye are\r\ncondemned.”\r\n\r\nMany people have brought disaster into their lives through idle words.\r\n\r\nFor example: A woman once asked me why her life was now one of poverty\r\nof limitation. Formerly she had a home, was surrounded by beautiful\r\nthings and had plenty of money. We found she had often tired of the\r\nmanagement of her home, and had said repeatedly, “I’m sick and tired of\r\nthings—I wish I lived in a trunk,” and she added: “Today I am living in\r\nthat trunk.” She had spoken herself into a trunk. The subconscious mind\r\nhas no sense of humor and people often joke themselves into unhappy\r\nexperiences.\r\n\r\nFor example: A woman who had a great deal of money, joked continually\r\nabout “getting ready for the poorhouse.”\r\n\r\nIn a few years she was almost destitute, having impressed the\r\nsubconscious mind with a picture of lack and limitation.\r\n\r\nFortunately the law works both ways, and a situation of lack may be\r\nchanged to one of plenty.\r\n\r\nFor example: A woman came to me one hot summer’s day for a “treatment”\r\nfor prosperity. She was worn out, dejected and discouraged. She said\r\nshe possessed just eight dollars in the world. I said, “Good, we’ll\r\nbless the eight dollars and multiply them as Jesus Christ multiplied\r\nthe loaves and the fishes,” for He taught that _every man_ had the\r\npower to bless and to multiply, to heal and to prosper.\r\n\r\nShe said, “What shall I do next?”\r\n\r\nI replied, “Follow intuition. Have you a ‘hunch’ to do anything, or to\r\ngo anywhere?” Intuition means, intuition, or to be taught from within.\r\nIt is man’s unerring guide, and I will deal more fully with its laws in\r\na following chapter.\r\n\r\nThe woman replied: “I don’t know—I seem to have a ‘hunch’ to go home;\r\nI’ve just enough money for carfare.” Her home was in a distant city and\r\nwas one of lack and limitation, and the reasoning mind (or intellect)\r\nwould have said: “Stay in New York and get work and make some money.”\r\nI replied, “Then go home—never violate a hunch.” I spoke the following\r\nwords for her: “_Infinite Spirit open the way for great abundance for\r\n——. She is an irresistible magnet for all that belongs to her by divine\r\nright._” I told her to repeat it continually also. She left for home\r\nimmediately. In calling on a woman one day, she linked up with an old\r\nfriend of her family.\r\n\r\nThrough this friend, she received thousands of dollars in a most\r\nmiraculous way. She has said to me often, “Tell people about the woman\r\nwho came to you with eight dollars and a hunch.”\r\n\r\nThere is always _plenty on man’s pathway_; but it can only be _brought\r\ninto manifestation_ through desire, faith or the spoken word. Jesus\r\nChrist brought out clearly that man must make the _first move_.\r\n\r\n“_Ask_, and it shall be given you, seek, and ye shall find, knock, and\r\nit shall be opened unto you.” (Mat. 7:7.)\r\n\r\nIn the Scriptures we read:\r\n\r\n“Concerning the works of my hands, command ye me.”\r\n\r\nInfinite Intelligence, God, is ever ready to carry out man’s smallest\r\nor greatest demands.\r\n\r\nEvery desire, uttered or unexpressed, is a demand. We are often\r\nstartled by having a wish suddenly fulfilled.\r\n\r\nFor example: One Easter, having seen many beautiful rose-trees in the\r\nflorists’ windows, I wished I would receive one, and for an instant saw\r\nit mentally being carried in the door.\r\n\r\nEaster came, and with it a beautiful rose-tree. I thanked my friend the\r\nfollowing day, and told her it was just what I had wanted.\r\n\r\nShe replied, “I didn’t send you a rose-tree, I sent you lilies!”\r\n\r\nThe man had mixed the order, and sent me a rose-tree simply because I\r\nhad started the law in action, and _I had to have a rose-tree_.\r\n\r\nNothing stands between man and his highest ideals and every desire of\r\nhis heart, but doubt and fear. When man can “wish without worrying,”\r\nevery desire will be instantly fulfilled.\r\n\r\nI will explain more fully in a following chapter the scientific reason\r\nfor this and how fear must be erased from the consciousness. It is\r\nman’s only enemy—fear of lack, fear of failure, fear of sickness, fear\r\nof loss and a feeling of _insecurity on some plane_. Jesus Christ said:\r\n“Why are ye fearful, oh ye of little faith?” (Mat. 8:26.) So we can see\r\nwe must substitute faith for fear, for fear is only inverted faith; it\r\nis faith in evil instead of good.\r\n\r\nThe object of the game of life is to see clearly one’s good and to\r\nobliterate all mental pictures of evil. This must be done by impressing\r\nthe subconscious mind with a realization of good. A very brilliant man,\r\nwho has attained great success, told me he had suddenly erased all\r\nfear from his consciousness by reading a sign which hung in a room.\r\nHe saw printed, in large letters this statement—“_Why worry, it will\r\nprobably never happen._” These words were stamped indelibly upon his\r\nsubconscious mind, and he has now a firm conviction that only good can\r\ncome into his life, therefore only _good can manifest_.\r\n\r\nIn the following chapter I will deal with the different methods of\r\nimpressing the subconscious mind. It is man’s faithful servant but one\r\nmust be careful to give it the right orders. Man has ever a silent\r\nlistener at his side—his subconscious mind.\r\n\r\nEvery thought, every word is impressed upon it and carried out in\r\namazing detail. It is like a singer making a record on the sensitive\r\ndisc of the phonographic plate. Every note and tone of the singer’s\r\nvoice is registered. If he coughs or hesitates, it is registered also.\r\nSo let us break all the old bad records in the subconscious mind, the\r\nrecords of our lives which we do not wish to keep, and make new and\r\nbeautiful ones.\r\n\r\nSpeak these words aloud, with power and conviction: “I now smash and\r\ndemolish (by my spoken word) every untrue record in my subconscious\r\nmind. They shall return to the dust-heap of their native nothingness,\r\nfor they came from my own vain imaginings. I now make my perfect\r\nrecords through the Christ within—The records of _Health, Wealth, Love\r\nand perfect self-Expression_.” This is the square of life, _The Game\r\ncompleted_.\r\n\r\nIn the following chapters, I will show how man can _change_ his\r\n_conditions by changing his words_. Any man who does not know the power\r\nof the word, is behind the times.\r\n\r\n  “_Death and Life are in the power of the tongue._”\r\n\r\n  (Prov. 18:21.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAW OF PROSPERITY\r\n\r\n    “Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defense\r\n    and thou shalt have plenty of silver.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest messages given to the race through the scriptures\r\nis that God is man’s supply and that man can release, _through his\r\nspoken word_, all that belongs to him by divine right. He must,\r\nhowever, have _perfect faith in his spoken word_.\r\n\r\nIsaiah said, “My word shall not return unto me void, but shall\r\naccomplish that where unto it is sent.” We know now, that words and\r\nthoughts are a tremendous vibratory force, ever moulding man’s body and\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nA woman came to me in great distress and said she was to be sued on the\r\nfifteenth of the month for three thousand dollars. She knew no way of\r\ngetting the money and was in despair.\r\n\r\nI told her God was her supply, and _that there is a supply for every\r\ndemand_.\r\n\r\n_So I spoke the word!_ I gave thanks that the woman would receive three\r\nthousand dollars at the right time in the right way. I told her she\r\nmust have perfect faith, and act her _perfect faith_. The fifteenth\r\ncame but no money had materialized.\r\n\r\nShe called me on the ’phone and asked what she was to do.\r\n\r\nI replied, “It is Saturday, so they won’t sue you today. Your part is\r\nto act rich, thereby showing perfect faith that you will receive it by\r\nMonday.” She asked me to lunch with her to keep up her courage. When\r\nI joined her at a restaurant, I said, “This is no time to economize.\r\nOrder an expensive luncheon, act as if you have already received the\r\nthree thousand dollars.”\r\n\r\n“All things whatsoever ye ask in prayer, _believing_, ye shall\r\nreceive.” “You must act as if you _had already received_.” The next\r\nmorning she called me on the ’phone and asked me to stay with her\r\nduring the day. I said “No, you are divinely protected and God is never\r\ntoo late.”\r\n\r\nIn the evening she ’phoned again, greatly excited and said, “My dear,\r\na miracle has happened! I was sitting in my room this morning, when\r\nthe doorbell rang. I said to the maid: ‘Don’t let anyone in.’ The maid\r\nhowever, looked out the window and said, ‘It’s your cousin with the\r\nlong white beard.’\r\n\r\nSo I said, ‘Call him back. I would like to see him.’ He was just\r\nturning the corner, when he heard the maid’s voice, and _he came back_.\r\n\r\nHe talked for about an hour, and just as he was leaving he said, ‘Oh,\r\nby the way, how are finances?’\r\n\r\nI told him I needed the money, and he said, ‘Why, my dear, I will give\r\nyou three thousand dollars the first of the month.’\r\n\r\nI didn’t like to tell him I was going to be sued. What shall I do? I\r\nwon’t _receive it till_ the first of the month, and I must have it\r\ntomorrow.” I said, “I’ll keep on ‘treating.’”\r\n\r\nI said, “Spirit is never too late. I give thanks she has received the\r\nmoney on the invisible plane and that it manifests on time.” The next\r\nmorning her cousin called her up and said, “Come to my office this\r\nmorning and I will give you the money.” That afternoon, she had three\r\nthousand dollars to her credit in the bank, and wrote checks as rapidly\r\nas her excitement would permit.\r\n\r\nIf one asks for success and prepares for failure, he will get the\r\nsituation he has prepared for. For example: A man came to me asking me\r\nto speak the word that a certain debt would be wiped out.\r\n\r\nI found he spent his time planning what he would say to the man when\r\nhe did not pay his bill, thereby neutralizing my words. He should have\r\nseen himself paying the debt.\r\n\r\nWe have a wonderful illustration of this in the bible, relating to\r\nthe three kings who were in the desert, without water for their men\r\nand horses. They consulted the prophet Elisha, who gave them this\r\nastonishing message:\r\n\r\n“Thus saith the Lord—Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain,\r\nyet make this valley full of ditches.”\r\n\r\nMan must prepare for the thing he has asked for, _when there isn’t the\r\nslightest sign of it in sight_.\r\n\r\nFor example: A woman found it necessary to look for an apartment during\r\nthe year when there was a great shortage of apartments in New York. It\r\nwas considered almost an impossibility, and her friends were sorry for\r\nher and said, “Isn’t it too bad, you’ll have to store your furniture\r\nand live in a hotel.” She replied, “_You needn’t feel sorry for me, I’m\r\na superman, and I’ll get an apartment._”\r\n\r\nShe spoke the words: “_Infinite Spirit, open the way for the right\r\napartment._” She knew there was a supply for every demand, and that she\r\nwas “unconditioned,” working on the spiritual plane, and that “one with\r\nGod is a majority.”\r\n\r\nShe had contemplated buying new blankets, when “the tempter,” the\r\nadverse thought or reasoning mind, suggested, “Don’t buy the blankets,\r\nperhaps, after all, you won’t get an apartment and you will have no use\r\nfor them.” She promptly replied (to herself): “I’ll dig my ditches by\r\nbuying the blankets!” So she prepared for the apartment—acted as though\r\nshe already had it.\r\n\r\nShe found one in a miraculous way, and it was given to her although\r\nthere were over _two hundred other applicants_.\r\n\r\nThe blankets showed active faith.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that the ditches dug by the three kings in the\r\ndesert were filled to over-flowing. (Read, II Kings.)\r\n\r\nGetting into the spiritual swing of things is no easy matter for the\r\naverage person. The adverse thoughts of doubt and fear surge from the\r\nsubconscious. They are the “army of the aliens” which must be put to\r\nflight. This explains why it is so often, “darkest before the dawn.”\r\n\r\nA big demonstration is usually preceded by tormenting thoughts.\r\n\r\nHaving made a statement of high spiritual truth one challenges the old\r\nbeliefs in the subconscious, and “error is exposed” to be put out.\r\n\r\nThis is the time when one must make his affirmations of truth\r\nrepeatedly, and rejoice and give thanks that he has already received.\r\n“Before ye call I shall answer.” This means that “every good and\r\nperfect gift” is already man’s awaiting his recognition.\r\n\r\nMan can only receive what he sees himself receiving.\r\n\r\nThe children of Israel were told that they could have all the land\r\nthey could see. This is true of every man. He has only the land within\r\nhis own mental vision. Every great work, every big accomplishment,\r\nhas been brought into manifestation through holding to the vision,\r\nand often just before the big achievement, comes apparent failure and\r\ndiscouragement.\r\n\r\nThe children of Israel when they reached the “Promised Land,” were\r\nafraid to go in, for they said it was filled with giants who made them\r\nfeel like grasshoppers. “And there we saw the giants and we were in our\r\nown sight as grasshoppers.” This is almost every man’s experience.\r\n\r\nHowever, the one who knows spiritual law, is undisturbed by appearance,\r\nand rejoices while he is “yet in captivity.” That is, he holds to his\r\nvision and gives thanks that the end is accomplished, he has received.\r\n\r\nJesus Christ gave a wonderful example of this. He said to his\r\ndisciples: “Say not ye, there are yet four months and then cometh the\r\nharvest? Behold, I say unto you, lift up your eyes and look on the\r\nfields; for they are ripe already to harvest.” His clear vision pierced\r\nthe “world of matter” and he saw clearly the fourth dimensional world,\r\nthings as they really are, perfect and complete in Divine Mind. So\r\nman must ever hold the vision of his journey’s end and demand the\r\nmanifestation of that which he has already received. It may be his\r\nperfect health, love, supply, self-expression, home or friends.\r\n\r\nThey are all finished and perfect ideas registered in Divine Mind\r\n(man’s own superconscious mind) and must come through him, not to him.\r\nFor example: A man came to me asking for treatments for success. It\r\nwas imperative that he raise, within a certain time, fifty-thousand\r\ndollars for his business. The time limit was almost up, when he came to\r\nme in despair. No one wanted to invest in his enterprise, and the bank\r\nhad flatly refused a loan. I replied: “I suppose you lost your temper\r\nwhile at the bank, therefore your power. You can control any situation\r\nif you first control yourself.” “Go back to the bank,” I added, “and\r\nI will treat.” My treatment was: “You are identified in love with the\r\nspirit of everyone connected with the bank. Let the divine idea come\r\nout of this situation.” He replied, “Woman, you are talking about an\r\nimpossibility. Tomorrow is Saturday; the bank closes at twelve, and my\r\ntrain won’t get me there until ten, and the time limit is up tomorrow,\r\nand anyway they won’t do it. It’s too late.” I replied, “God doesn’t\r\nneed any time and is never too late. With Him all things are possible.”\r\nI added, “I don’t know anything about business, but I know all about\r\nGod.” He replied: “It all sounds fine when I sit here listening to you,\r\nbut when I go out it’s terrible.” He lived in a distant city, and I did\r\nnot hear from him for a week, then came a letter. It read: “You were\r\nright. I raised the money, and will never again doubt the truth of all\r\nthat you told me.”\r\n\r\nI saw him a few weeks later, and I said, “What happened? You evidently\r\nhad plenty of time, after all.” He replied “My train was late, and\r\nI got there just fifteen minutes to twelve. I walked into the bank\r\nquietly and said, ‘I have come for the loan,’ and they gave it to me\r\nwithout a question.”\r\n\r\nIt was the last fifteen minutes of the time allotted to him, and\r\nInfinite Spirit was not too late. In this instance the man could never\r\nhave demonstrated alone. He needed someone to help him hold to the\r\nvision. This is what one man can do for another.\r\n\r\nJesus Christ knew the truth of this when he said: “If two of you shall\r\nagree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be\r\ndone for them of my Father which is in heaven.” One gets too close to\r\nhis own affairs and becomes doubtful and fearful.\r\n\r\nThe friend or “healer” sees clearly the success, health, or prosperity,\r\nand never wavers, because he is not close to the situation.\r\n\r\nIt is much easier to “demonstrate” for someone else than for one’s\r\nself, so a person should not hesitate to ask for help, if he feels\r\nhimself wavering.\r\n\r\nA keen observer of life once said, “no man can fail, if some one person\r\nsees him successful.” Such is the power of the vision, and many a\r\ngreat man has owed his success to a wife, or sister, or a friend who\r\n“believed in him” and held without wavering to the perfect pattern!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POWER OF THE WORD\r\n\r\n        “By thy words thou shalt be justified,\r\n    and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA person knowing the power of the word, becomes very careful of his\r\nconversation. He has only to watch the reaction of his words to know\r\nthat they do “not return void.” Through his spoken word, man is\r\ncontinually making laws for himself.\r\n\r\nI knew a man who said, “I always miss a car. It invariably pulls out\r\njust as I arrive.”\r\n\r\nHis daughter said: “I always catch a car. It’s sure to come just as I\r\nget there.” This occurred for years. Each had made a separate law for\r\nhimself, one of failure, one of success. This is the psychology of\r\nsuperstitions.\r\n\r\nThe horseshoe or rabbit’s foot contains no power, but man’s spoken word\r\nand belief that it will bring him good luck creates expectancy in the\r\nsubconscious mind, and attracts a “lucky situation.” I find however,\r\nthis will not “work” when man has advanced spiritually and knows a\r\nhigher law. One cannot turn back, and must put away “graven images.”\r\nFor example: Two men in my class had had great success in business\r\nfor several months, when suddenly everything “went to smash.” We\r\ntried to analyze the situation, and I found, instead of making their\r\naffirmations and looking to God for success and prosperity, they had\r\neach bought a “lucky monkey.” I said: “Oh I see, you have been trusting\r\nin the lucky monkeys instead of God.” “Put away the lucky monkeys\r\nand call on the law of forgiveness,” for man has power to forgive or\r\nneutralize his mistakes.\r\n\r\nThey decided to throw the lucky monkeys down a coalhole, and all went\r\nwell again. This does not mean, however, that one should throw away\r\nevery “lucky” ornament or horseshoe about the house, but he must\r\nrecognize that the power back of it is the one and only power, God, and\r\nthat the object simply gives him a feeling of expectancy.\r\n\r\nI was with a friend, one day, who was in deep despair. In crossing the\r\nstreet, she picked up a horseshoe. Immediately, she was filled with joy\r\nand hope. She said God had sent her the horseshoe in order to keep up\r\nher courage.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed, at that moment, about the only thing that could have\r\nregistered in her consciousness. Her hope became faith, and she\r\nultimately made a wonderful demonstration. I wish to make the point\r\nclear that the men previously mentioned were depending on the monkeys,\r\nalone, while this woman recognized the power back of the horseshoe.\r\n\r\nI know, in my own case, it took a long while to get out of a belief\r\nthat a certain thing brought disappointment. If the thing happened,\r\ndisappointment invariably followed. I found the only way I could\r\nmake a change in the subconscious, was by asserting, “There are not\r\ntwo powers, there is only one power, God, therefore, there are no\r\ndisappointments, and this thing means a happy surprise.” I noticed a\r\nchange at once, and happy surprises commenced coming my way.\r\n\r\nI have a friend who said nothing could induce her to walk under a\r\nladder. I said, “If you are afraid, you are giving in to a belief in\r\ntwo powers, Good and Evil, instead of one. As God is absolute, there\r\ncan be no opposing power, unless man makes the false of evil for\r\nhimself. To show you believe in only One Power, God, and that there\r\nis no power or reality in evil, walk under the next ladder you see.”\r\nSoon after, she went to her bank. She wished to open her box in the\r\nsafe-deposit vault, and there stood a ladder on her pathway. It was\r\nimpossible to reach the box without passing under the ladder. She\r\nquailed with fear and turned back. She could not face the lion on\r\nher pathway. However, when she reached the street, my words rang in\r\nher ears and she decided to return and walk under it. It was a big\r\nmoment in her life, for ladders had held her in bondage for years. She\r\nretraced her steps to the vault, and the ladder was no longer there!\r\nThis so often happens! If one is willing to do a thing he is afraid to\r\ndo, he does not have to.\r\n\r\nIt is the law of nonresistance, which is so little understood.\r\n\r\nSomeone has said that courage contains genius and magic. Face a\r\nsituation fearlessly, and there is no situation to face; it falls away\r\nof its own weight.\r\n\r\nThe explanation is, that fear attracted the ladder on the woman’s\r\npathway, and fearlessness removed it.\r\n\r\n_Thus the invisible forces are ever working for man who is always\r\n“pulling the strings” himself, though he does not know it. Owing to the\r\nvibratory power of words, whatever man voices, he begins to attract.\r\nPeople who continually speak of disease, invariably attract it._\r\n\r\nAfter man knows the truth, he cannot be too careful of his words. For\r\nexample: I have a friend who often says on the ’phone, “Do come to see\r\nme and have a fine old-fashioned chat.” This “old-fashioned chat” means\r\nan hour of about five hundred to a thousand destructive words, the\r\nprincipal topics being loss, lack, failure and sickness.\r\n\r\nI reply: “No, I thank you, I’ve had enough old-fashioned chats\r\nin my life, they are too expensive, but I will be glad to have a\r\nnew-fashioned chat, and talk about what we want, not what we don’t\r\nwant.” There is an old saying that man only dares use his words for\r\nthree purposes, to “heal, bless or prosper.” What man says of others\r\nwill be said of him, and what he wishes for another, he is wishing for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n“Curses, like chickens, come home to roost.”\r\n\r\nIf a man wishes someone “bad luck,” he is sure to attract bad luck\r\nhimself. If he wishes to aid someone to success, he is wishing and\r\naiding himself to success.\r\n\r\nThe body may be renewed and transformed through the spoken word and\r\nclear vision, and disease be completely wiped out of the consciousness.\r\nThe metaphysician knows that all disease has a mental correspondence,\r\nand in order to heal the body one must first “heal the soul.”\r\n\r\nThe soul is the subconscious mind, and it must be “saved” from wrong\r\nthinking.\r\n\r\nIn the twenty-third psalm, we read: “He restoreth my soul.” This means\r\nthat the subconscious mind or soul, must be restored with the right\r\nideas, and the “mystical marriage” is the marriage of the soul and\r\nthe spirit, or the subconscious and superconscious mind. They must be\r\none. When the subconscious is flooded with the perfect ideas of the\r\nsuperconscious, God and man are one. “I and the Father are one.” That\r\nis, he is one with the realm of perfect ideas; he is the man made in\r\nGod’s likeness and image (imagination) and is given power and dominion\r\nover all created things, his mind, body and affairs.\r\n\r\nIt is safe to say that all sickness and unhappiness come from the\r\nviolation of the law of love. A new commandment I give unto you, “Love\r\none another,” and in the Game of Life, love or good-will takes every\r\ntrick.\r\n\r\nFor example: A woman I know, had, for years an appearance of a terrible\r\nskin disease. The doctors told her it was incurable, and she was in\r\ndespair. She was on the stage, and she feared she would soon have to\r\ngive up her profession, and she had no other means of support. She,\r\nhowever, procured a good engagement, and on the opening night, made a\r\ngreat “hit.” She received flattering notices from the critics, and was\r\njoyful and elated. The next day she received a notice of dismissal.\r\nA man in the cast had been jealous of her success and had caused her\r\nto be sent away. She felt hatred and resentment taking complete\r\npossession of her, and she cried out, “Oh God don’t let me hate that\r\nman.” That night she worked for hours “in the silence.”\r\n\r\nShe said, “I soon came into a very deep silence. I seemed to be at\r\npeace with myself, with the man, and with the whole world. I continued\r\nthis for two following nights, and on the third day I found I was\r\nhealed completely of the skin disease!” In asking for love, or good\r\nwill, she had fulfilled the law, (“for love is the fulfilling of the\r\nlaw”) and the disease (which came from subconscious resentment) was\r\nwiped out.\r\n\r\nContinual criticism produces rheumatism, as critical, inharmonious\r\nthoughts cause unnatural deposits in the blood, which settle in the\r\njoints.\r\n\r\nFalse growths are caused by jealousy, hatred, unforgiveness, fear,\r\netc. Every disease is caused by a mind not at ease. I said once, in my\r\nclass, “There is no use asking anyone ‘What’s the matter with you?’ we\r\nmight just as well say, ‘Who’s the matter with you?’” Unforgiveness is\r\nthe most prolific cause of disease. It will harden arteries or liver,\r\nand affect the eye-sight. In its train are endless ills.\r\n\r\nI called on a woman, one day, who said she was ill from having eaten\r\na poisoned oyster. I replied, “Oh, no, the oyster was harmless, you\r\npoisoned the oyster. What’s the matter with you?” She answered, “Oh\r\nabout nineteen people.” She had quarrelled with nineteen people and had\r\nbecome so inharmonious that she attracted the wrong oyster.\r\n\r\nAny inharmony on the external, indicates there is mental inharmony. “As\r\nthe within, so the without.”\r\n\r\nMan’s only enemies are within himself. “And a man’s foes shall be\r\nthey of his own household.” Personality is one of the last enemies\r\nto be overcome, as this planet is taking its initiation in love. It\r\nwas Christ’s message—“Peace on Earth, good will towards man.” The\r\nenlightened man, therefore, endeavors to perfect himself upon his\r\nneighbor. His work is with himself, to send out good-will and blessings\r\nto every man, and the marvelous thing is, that if one blesses a man he\r\nhas no power to harm him.\r\n\r\nFor example: A man came to me asking to “treat” for success in\r\nbusiness. He was selling machinery, and a rival appeared on the scene\r\nwith what he proclaimed, was a better machine, and my friend feared\r\ndefeat. I said, “First of all, we must wipe out all fear, and know\r\nthat God protects your interests, and that the divine idea must come\r\nout of the situation. That is, the right machine will be sold, by the\r\nright man, to the right man.” And I added, “Don’t hold one critical\r\nthought towards that man. Bless him all day, and be willing not to sell\r\nyour machine, if it isn’t the divine idea.” So he went to the meeting,\r\nfearless and nonresistant, and blessing the other man. He said the\r\noutcome was very remarkable. The other man’s machine refused to work,\r\nand he sold his without the slightest difficulty. “But I say unto you,\r\nlove your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate\r\nyou, and pray for them which spitefully use you and persecute you.”\r\n\r\n_Good-will produces a great aura of protection about the one who sends\r\nit, and “No weapon that is formed against him shall prosper.” In\r\nother words, love and good-will destroy the enemies within one’s self,\r\ntherefore, one has no enemies on the external!_\r\n\r\n“_There is peace on earth for him who sends good-will to man!_”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAW OF NONRESISTANCE\r\n\r\n    “Resist not evil. Be not overcome of evil,\r\n        but overcome evil with good.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing on earth can resist an absolutely nonresistant person.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese say that water is the most powerful element, because it is\r\nperfectly nonresistant. It can wear away a rock, and sweep all before\r\nit.\r\n\r\nJesus Christ said, “Resist not evil,” for He knew in reality, there\r\nis no evil, therefore nothing to resist. Evil has come of man’s “vain\r\nimagination,” or a belief in two powers, good and evil.\r\n\r\nThere is an old legend, that Adam and Eve ate of “Maya the Tree of\r\nIllusion,” and saw two powers instead of one power, God.\r\n\r\n_Therefore, evil is a false law man has made for himself, through\r\npsychoma or soul sleep._ Soul sleep means, that man’s soul has been\r\nhypnotized by the race belief (of sin, sickness and death, etc.) which\r\nis carnal or mortal thought, and his affairs have outpictured his\r\nillusions.\r\n\r\nWe have read in a preceding chapter, that man’s soul is his\r\nsubconscious mind, and whatever he feels deeply, good or bad, is\r\noutpictured by that faithful servant. His body and affairs show forth\r\nwhat he has been picturing. The sick man has pictured sickness, the\r\npoor man, poverty, the rich man, wealth.\r\n\r\nPeople often say, “why does a little child attract illness, when it is\r\ntoo young even to know what it means?”\r\n\r\nI answer that children are sensitive and receptive to the thoughts of\r\nothers about them, and often outpicture the fears of their parents.\r\n\r\nI heard a metaphysician once say, “If you do not run your subconscious\r\nmind yourself, someone else will run it for you.”\r\n\r\nMothers often, unconsciously, attract illness and disaster to their\r\nchildren, by continually holding them in thoughts of fear, and watching\r\nfor symptoms.\r\n\r\nFor example: A friend asked a woman if her little girl had had the\r\nmeasles. She replied promptly, “not yet!” This implied that she was\r\nexpecting the illness, and, therefore, preparing the way for what she\r\ndid not want for herself and child.\r\n\r\nHowever, the man who is centered and established in right thinking,\r\nthe man who sends out only good-will to his fellow-man, and who is\r\nwithout fear, cannot be _touched or influenced by the negative thoughts\r\nof others_. In fact, he could then receive only good thoughts, as he\r\nhimself, sends forth only good thoughts.\r\n\r\nResistance is Hell, for it places man in a “state of torment.”\r\n\r\nA metaphysician once gave me a wonderful recipe for taking every trick\r\nin the game of life, it is the acme of nonresistance. He gave it in\r\nthis way; “At one time in my life, I baptized children, and of course,\r\nthey had many names. Now I no longer baptize children, but I baptize\r\nevents, but _I give every event the same name_. If I have a failure I\r\nbaptize it success, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of\r\nthe Holy Ghost!”\r\n\r\nIn this, we see the great law of transmutation, founded on\r\nnonresistance. Through his spoken word, every failure was transmuted\r\ninto success.\r\n\r\nFor example: A woman who required money, and who knew the spiritual\r\nlaw of opulence, was thrown continually in a business-way, with a\r\nman who made her feel very poor. He talked lack and limitation and\r\nshe commenced to catch his poverty thoughts, so she disliked him,\r\nand blamed him for her failure. She knew in order to demonstrate\r\nher supply, she must first feel that she _had received—a feeling of\r\nopulence must precede its manifestation_.\r\n\r\nIt dawned upon her, one day, that she was resisting the situation, and\r\nseeing two powers instead of one. So she blessed the man and baptized\r\nthe situation “Success”! She affirmed, “As there is only one power,\r\nGod, this man is here for my good and my prosperity” (just what he\r\ndid not seem to be there for). Soon after that she met, _through this\r\nman_, a woman who gave her for a service rendered, several thousand\r\ndollars, and the man moved to a distant city, and faded harmoniously\r\nfrom her life. Make the statement, “Every man is a golden link in the\r\nchain of my good,” for all men are God in manifestation, _awaiting the\r\nopportunity given by man, himself, to serve the divine plan of his\r\nlife_.\r\n\r\n“Bless your enemy, and you rob him of his ammunition.” His arrows will\r\nbe transmuted into blessings.\r\n\r\nThis law is true of nations as well as individuals. Bless a nation,\r\nsend love and good-will to every inhabitant, and it is robbed of its\r\npower to harm.\r\n\r\nMan can only get the right idea of nonresistance, through spiritual\r\nunderstanding. My students have often said: “I don’t want to be a\r\ndoor-mat.” I reply “when you use nonresistance with wisdom, no one will\r\never be able to walk over you.”\r\n\r\nAnother example: One day I was impatiently awaiting an important\r\ntelephone call. I resisted every call that came in and made no\r\nout-going calls myself, reasoning that it might interfere with the one\r\nI was awaiting.\r\n\r\nInstead of saying, “Divine ideas never conflict, the call will come\r\nat the right time,” leaving it to Infinite Intelligence to arrange, I\r\ncommenced to manage things myself—I made the battle mine, not God’s\r\nand remained tense and anxious. The bell did not ring for about an\r\nhour, and I glanced at the ’phone and found the receiver had been off\r\nthat length of time, and the ’phone was disconnected. My anxiety,\r\nfear and belief in interference, had brought on a total eclipse of\r\nthe telephone. Realizing what I had done, I commenced blessing the\r\nsituation at once; I baptized it “success,” and affirmed, “I cannot\r\nlose any call that belongs to me by divine right; I am under _grace,\r\nand not under law_.”\r\n\r\nA friend rushed out to the nearest telephone, to notify the Company to\r\nreconnect.\r\n\r\nShe entered a crowded grocery, but the proprietor left his customers\r\nand attended to the call himself. My ’phone was connected at once, and\r\ntwo minutes later, I received a very important call, and about an hour\r\nafterward, the one I had been awaiting.\r\n\r\n  _One’s ships come in over a calm sea._\r\n\r\nSo long as man resists a situation, he will have it with him. If he\r\nruns away from it, it will run after him.\r\n\r\nFor example: I repeated this to a woman one day, and she replied, “How\r\ntrue that is! I was unhappy at home, I disliked my mother, who was\r\ncritical and domineering; so I ran away and was married—but I married\r\nmy mother, for my husband was exactly like my mother, and I had the\r\nsame situation to face again.” “Agree with thine adversary quickly.”\r\n\r\nThat means, agree that the adverse situation is good, be undisturbed\r\nby it, and it falls away of its own weight. “None of these things move\r\nme,” is a wonderful affirmation.\r\n\r\nThe inharmonious situation comes from some inharmony within man himself.\r\n\r\nWhen there is, in him, no emotional response to an inharmonious\r\nsituation, it fades away forever, from his pathway.\r\n\r\nSo we see man’s work is ever with himself.\r\n\r\nPeople have said to me, “Give treatments to change my husband, or my\r\nbrother.” I reply, “No, I will give _treatments to change you_; when\r\nyou change, your husband and your brother will change.”\r\n\r\nOne of my students was in the habit of lying. I told her it was a\r\nfailure method and if she lied, she would be lied to. She replied, “I\r\ndon’t care, I can’t possibly get along without lying.”\r\n\r\nOne day she was speaking on the ’phone to a man with whom she was very\r\nmuch in love. She turned to me and said, “I don’t trust him, I know\r\nhe’s lying to me.” I replied, “Well, you lie yourself, so someone has\r\nto lie to you, and you will be sure it will be just the person you want\r\nthe truth from.” Some time after that, I saw her, and she said, “I’m\r\ncured of lying.”\r\n\r\nI questioned: “What cured you?”\r\n\r\nShe replied: “I have been living with a woman who lied worse than I\r\ndid!”\r\n\r\nOne is often cured of his faults by seeing them in others.\r\n\r\nLife is a mirror, and we find only ourselves reflected in our\r\nassociates.\r\n\r\nLiving in the past is a failure method and a violation of spiritual law.\r\n\r\nJesus Christ said, “Behold, now is the accepted time.” “Now is the day\r\nof Salvation.”\r\n\r\nLot’s wife looked back and was turned into a pillar of salt.\r\n\r\nThe robbers of time are the past and the future. Man should bless the\r\npast, and forget it, if it keeps him in bondage, and bless the future,\r\nknowing it has in store for him endless joys, but live _fully in the\r\nnow_.\r\n\r\nFor example: A woman came to me, complaining that she had no money with\r\nwhich to buy Christmas gifts. She said, “Last year was so different;\r\nI had plenty of money and gave lovely presents, and this year I have\r\nscarcely a cent.”\r\n\r\nI replied, “You will never demonstrate money while you are pathetic\r\nand live in the past. Live fully in the _now_, and _get ready to give\r\nChristmas presents_. Dig your ditches, and the money will come.” She\r\nexclaimed, “I know what to do! I will buy some tinsel twine, Christmas\r\nseals and wrapping paper.” I replied, “Do that, and the _presents will\r\ncome and stick themselves to the Christmas seals_.”\r\n\r\nThis too, was showing financial fearlessness and faith in God, as the\r\nreasoning mind said, “Keep every cent you have, as you are not sure you\r\nwill get any more.”\r\n\r\nShe bought the seals, paper and twine, and a few days before Christmas,\r\nreceived a gift of several hundred dollars. Buying the seals and twine\r\nhad impressed the subconscious with expectancy, and opened the way\r\nfor the manifestation of the money. She purchased all the presents in\r\nplenty of time.\r\n\r\nMan must live suspended in the moment.\r\n\r\n“Look well, therefore, to this Day! Such is the salutation of the Dawn.”\r\n\r\nHe must be spiritually alert, ever awaiting his leads, taking advantage\r\nof every opportunity.\r\n\r\nOne day, I said continually (silently), “Infinite Spirit, don’t let\r\nme miss a trick,” and something very important was told to me that\r\nevening. It is most necessary to begin the day with right words.\r\n\r\nMake an affirmation immediately upon waking.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n“_Thy will be done this day! Today is a day of completion; I give\r\nthanks for this perfect day, miracle shall follow miracle and wonders\r\nshall never cease._”\r\n\r\nMake this a habit, and one will see wonders and miracles come into his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nOne morning I picked up a book and read, “Look with wonder at that\r\nwhich is before you!” It seemed to be my message for the day, so I\r\nrepeated again and again, “Look with wonder at that which is before\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nAt about noon, a large sum of money, was given me, which I had been\r\ndesiring for a certain purpose.\r\n\r\nIn a following chapter, I will give affirmations that I have found\r\nmost effective. However, one should never use an affirmation unless it\r\nis absolutely satisfying and convincing to his own consciousness, and\r\noften an affirmative is changed to suit different people.\r\n\r\nFor example: The following has brought success to many:\r\n\r\n“I have a wonderful work, in a wonderful way, I give wonderful service,\r\nfor wonderful pay!”\r\n\r\nI gave the first two lines to one of my students, and she added the\r\nlast two.\r\n\r\nIt made a _most powerful statement_, as there should always be perfect\r\npayment for perfect service, and a rhyme sinks easily into the\r\nsubconscious. She went about singing it aloud and soon did receive\r\nwonderful work in a wonderful way, and gave wonderful service for\r\nwonderful pay.\r\n\r\nAnother student, a business man, took it, and changed the word work to\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nHe repeated, “I have a wonderful business, in a wonderful way, and I\r\ngive wonderful service for wonderful pay.” That afternoon he made a\r\nforty-one-thousand dollar deal, though there had been no activity in\r\nhis affairs for months.\r\n\r\nEvery affirmation must be carefully worded and completely “cover the\r\nground.”\r\n\r\nFor example: I knew a woman, who was in great need, and made a demand\r\nfor work. She received a great deal of work, but was never paid\r\nanything. She now knows to add, “wonderful service for wonderful pay.”\r\n\r\nIt is man’s divine right to have plenty! More than enough!\r\n\r\n“His barns should be full, and his cup should flow over!” This is God’s\r\nidea for man, and when man breaks down the barriers of lack in his own\r\nconsciousness, the Golden Age will be his, and every righteous desire\r\nof his heart fulfilled!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAW OF KARMA\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nTHE LAW OF FORGIVENESS\r\n\r\n\r\nMan receives only that which he gives. The Game of Life is a game of\r\nboomerangs. Man’s thoughts, deeds and words, return to him sooner or\r\nlater, with astounding accuracy.\r\n\r\nThis is the law of Karma, which is Sanskrit for “Comeback.” “Whatsoever\r\na man soweth, that shall he also reap.”\r\n\r\nFor example: A friend told me this story of herself, illustrating the\r\nlaw. She said, “I make all my Karma on my aunt, whatever I say to her,\r\nsome one says to me. I am often irritable at home, and one day, said to\r\nmy aunt, who was talking to me during dinner. ‘_No more talk, I wish to\r\neat in peace._’”\r\n\r\n“The following day, I was lunching with a woman with whom I wished to\r\nmake a great impression. I was talking animatedly, when she said: ‘_No\r\nmore talk, I wish to eat in peace!_’”\r\n\r\nMy friend is high in consciousness, so her Karma returns much more\r\nquickly than to one on the mental plane.\r\n\r\nThe more man knows, the more he is responsible for, and a person with\r\na knowledge of Spiritual Law, which he does not practice, suffers\r\ngreatly, in consequence. “The fear of the Lord (law) is the beginning\r\nof wisdom.” If we read the word Lord, law, it will make many passages\r\nin the Bible much clearer.\r\n\r\n“Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord” (law). It is the law\r\nwhich takes vengeance, not God. God sees man perfect, “created in his\r\nown image,” (imagination) and given “power and dominion.”\r\n\r\nThis is the perfect idea of man, registered in Divine Mind, awaiting\r\nman’s recognition; for man can only be what he sees himself to be, and\r\nonly attain what he sees himself attaining.\r\n\r\n“Nothing ever happens without an on-looker” is an ancient saying.\r\n\r\nMan sees first his failure or success, his joy or sorrow, before it\r\nswings into visibility from the scenes set in his own imagination. We\r\nhave observed this in the mother picturing disease for her child, or a\r\nwoman seeing success for her husband.\r\n\r\nJesus Christ said, “And ye shall know the truth and the truth shall\r\nmake you free.”\r\n\r\nSo, we see freedom (from all unhappy conditions) comes through\r\nknowledge—a knowledge of Spiritual Law.\r\n\r\nObedience precedes authority, and the law obeys man when he obeys the\r\nlaw. The law of electricity must be obeyed before it becomes man’s\r\nservant. When handled ignorantly, it becomes man’s deadly foe. _So\r\nwith the laws of Mind!_\r\n\r\nFor example: A woman with a strong personal will, wished she owned a\r\nhouse which belonged to an acquaintance, and she often made mental\r\npictures of herself living in the house. In the course of time, the man\r\ndied and she moved into the house. Several years afterwards, coming\r\ninto the knowledge of Spiritual Law, she said to me: “Do you think I\r\nhad anything to do with that man’s death?” I replied: “Yes, your desire\r\nwas so strong, everything made way for it, but you paid your Karmic\r\ndebt. Your husband, whom you loved devotedly, died soon after, and the\r\nhouse was a white elephant on your hands for years.”\r\n\r\nThe original owner, however, could not have been affected by her\r\nthoughts had he been positive in the truth, nor her husband, but they\r\nwere both under Karmic law. The woman should have said (feeling the\r\ngreat desire for the house), “Infinite Intelligence, give me the right\r\nhouse, equally as charming as this, the house _which is mine by divine\r\nright_.”\r\n\r\nThe divine selection would have given perfect satisfaction and brought\r\ngood to all. The divine pattern is the only safe pattern to work by.\r\n\r\n_Desire is a tremendous force, and must be directed in the right\r\nchannels; or chaos ensues._\r\n\r\nIn demonstrating, the most important step is the _first step, to “ask\r\naright_.”\r\n\r\nMan should always demand only that which is his by _divine right_.\r\n\r\nTo go back to the illustration: Had the woman taken this attitude: “If\r\nthis house, I desire, is mine, I cannot lose it, if it is not, give me\r\nits equivalent,” the man might have decided to move out, harmoniously\r\n(had it been the divine selection for her) or another house would have\r\nbeen substituted. Anything forced into manifestation through personal\r\nwill, is always “ill-got,” and has “ever bad success.”\r\n\r\nMan is admonished, “My will be done not thine, and the curious thing\r\nis, man always gets just what he desires when he does relinquish\r\npersonal will, thereby enabling Infinite Intelligence to work through\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“Stand ye still and see the salvation of the Lord” (law).\r\n\r\nFor example: A woman came to me in great distress. Her daughter had\r\ndetermined to take a very hazardous trip, and the mother was filled\r\nwith fear.\r\n\r\nShe said she had used every argument, had pointed out the dangers to be\r\nencountered, and forbidden her to go, but the daughter became more and\r\nmore rebellious and determined. I said to the mother, “You are forcing\r\nyour personal will upon your daughter, which you have no right to do,\r\nand your fear of the trip is only attracting it, for man attracts what\r\nhe fears.” I added, “Let go, and take your mental hands off; _put it\r\nin God’s Hands, and use this statement_:” “I put this situation in the\r\nhands of Infinite Love and Wisdom; if this trip is the Divine plan,\r\nI bless it and no longer resist, but if it is not divinely planned,\r\nI give thanks that it is now dissolved and dissipated.” A day or two\r\nafter that, her daughter said to her, “Mother, I have given up the\r\ntrip,” and the situation returned to its “native nothingness.”\r\n\r\nIt is learning to “stand still,” which seems so difficult for man. I\r\nhave dealt more fully with this law in the chapter on nonresistance.\r\n\r\nI will give another example of sowing and reaping, which came in the\r\nmost curious way.\r\n\r\nA woman came to me saying, she had received a counterfeit twenty-dollar\r\nbill, given to her at the bank. She was much disturbed, for, she said,\r\n“The people at the bank will never acknowledge their mistake.”\r\n\r\nI replied, “Let us analyze the situation and find out why you attracted\r\nit.” She thought a few moments and exclaimed: “I know it, I sent a\r\nfriend a lot of stagemoney, just for a joke.” So the law had sent her\r\nsome stagemoney, for it doesn’t know anything about jokes.\r\n\r\nI said, “Now we will call on the law of forgiveness, and neutralize the\r\nsituation.”\r\n\r\nChristianity is founded upon the law of forgiveness—Christ has redeemed\r\nus from the curse of the Karmic law, and the Christ within each man is\r\nhis Redeemer and Salvation from all inharmonious conditions.\r\n\r\nSo I said: “Infinite Spirit, we call on the law of forgiveness and give\r\nthanks that she is under grace and not under law, and cannot lose this\r\ntwenty dollars which is hers by divine right.”\r\n\r\n“Now,” I said, “Go back to the bank and tell them, fearlessly, that it\r\nwas given you, there by mistake.”\r\n\r\nShe obeyed, and to her surprise, they apologized and gave her another\r\nbill, treating her most courteously.\r\n\r\nSo knowledge of the Law gives man power to “rub out his mistakes.” Man\r\ncannot force the external to be what he is not.\r\n\r\nIf he desires riches, he must be rich first in consciousness.\r\n\r\nFor example: A woman came to me asking treatment for prosperity. She\r\ndid not take much interest in her household affairs, and her home was\r\nin great disorder.\r\n\r\nI said to her, “If you wish to be rich, you must be orderly. All\r\nmen with great wealth are orderly—and order is heaven’s first law.”\r\nI added, “You will never become rich with a burnt match in the\r\npincushion.”\r\n\r\nShe had a good sense of humor and commenced immediately, putting her\r\nhouse in order. She rearranged furniture, straightened out bureau\r\ndrawers, cleaned rugs, and soon made a big financial demonstration—a\r\ngift from a relative. The woman, herself, became made over, and keeps\r\nherself keyed-up financially, by being ever watchful of the _external\r\nand expecting prosperity, knowing God is her supply_.\r\n\r\nMany people are in ignorance of the fact that gifts and things are\r\ninvestments, and that hoarding and saving invariably lead to loss.\r\n\r\n“There is that scattereth and yet increaseth; and there is that\r\nwithholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.”\r\n\r\nFor example: I knew a man who wanted to buy a fur-lined overcoat. He\r\nand his wife went to various shops, but there was none he wanted. He\r\nsaid they were all too cheap-looking. At last, he was shown one, the\r\nsalesman said was valued at a thousand dollars, but which the manager\r\nwould sell him for five-hundred dollars, as it was late in the season.\r\n\r\nHis financial possessions amounted to about seven hundred dollars. The\r\nreasoning mind would have said, “You can’t afford to spend nearly all\r\nyou have on a coat,” but he was very intuitive and never reasoned.\r\n\r\nHe turned to his wife and said, “If I get this coat, I’ll make a ton of\r\nmoney!” So his wife consented, weakly.\r\n\r\nAbout a month later, he received a ten-thousand-dollar commission. The\r\ncoat made him feel so rich, it linked him with success and prosperity;\r\nwithout the coat, he would not have received the commission. It was an\r\ninvestment paying large dividends!\r\n\r\nIf man ignores these leadings to spend or to give, the same amount of\r\nmoney will go in an uninteresting or unhappy way.\r\n\r\nFor example: A woman told me, on Thanksgiving Day, she informed her\r\nfamily that they could not afford a Thanksgiving dinner. She had the\r\nmoney, but decided to save it.\r\n\r\nA few days later, someone entered her room and took from the bureau\r\ndrawer the exact amount the dinner would have cost.\r\n\r\nThe law always stands back of the man who spends fearlessly, with\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\nFor example: One of my students was shopping with her little nephew.\r\nThe child clamored for a toy, which she told him she could not afford\r\nto buy.\r\n\r\nShe realized suddenly that she was seeking lack, and not recognizing\r\nGod as her supply!\r\n\r\nSo she bought the toy, and on her way home, picked _up, in the street,\r\nthe exact amount of money she had paid for it_.\r\n\r\nMan’s supply is inexhaustible and unfailing when fully trusted, but\r\nfaith or trust must precede the demonstration. “According to your faith\r\nbe it unto you.” “Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the\r\nevidence of things not seen—” for faith holds the vision steady, and\r\nthe adverse pictures are dissolved and dissipated, and “in due season\r\nwe shall reap, if we faint not.”\r\n\r\nJesus Christ brought the good news (the gospel) that there was a\r\nhigher law than the law of Karma—and that that law transcends the law\r\nof Karma. It is the law of grace, or forgiveness. It is the law which\r\n_frees man from the law of cause and effect—the law of consequence.\r\n“Under grace, and not under law.”_\r\n\r\nWe are told that on this plane, man reaps where he has not sown; the\r\ngifts of God are simply poured out upon him. “All that the Kingdom\r\naffords is his.” This continued state of bliss awaits the man who has\r\novercome the race (or world) thought.\r\n\r\nIn the world thought there is tribulation, but Jesus Christ said: “Be\r\nof good cheer; I have overcome the world.”\r\n\r\nThe world thought is that of sin, sickness and death. He saw their\r\nabsolute unreality and said sickness and sorrow shall pass away and\r\ndeath itself, the last enemy, be overcome.\r\n\r\nWe know now, from a scientific standpoint, that death could be overcome\r\nby stamping the subconscious mind with the conviction of eternal youth\r\nand eternal life.\r\n\r\nThe subconscious, being simply power without direction, _carries out\r\norders without questioning_.\r\n\r\nWorking under the direction of the superconscious (the Christ or God\r\nwithin man) the “resurrection of the body” would be accomplished.\r\n\r\nMan would no longer throw off his body in death, it would be\r\ntransformed into the “body electric,” sung by Walt Whitman, for\r\nChristianity is founded upon the forgiveness of sins and “an empty\r\ntomb.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTING THE BURDEN\r\n\r\nImpressing the Subconscious\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen man knows his own powers and the workings of his mind, his great\r\ndesire is to find an easy and quick way to impress the subconscious\r\nwith good, for simply an intellectual knowledge of the Truth will not\r\nbring results.\r\n\r\nIn my own case, I found the easiest way is in “casting the burden.”\r\n\r\nA metaphysician once explained it in this manner. He said, “The only\r\nthing which gives anything weight in nature, is the law of gravitation,\r\nand if a boulder could be taken high above the planet, there would be\r\nno weight in that boulder; and that is what Jesus Christ meant when he\r\nsaid: ‘My yoke is easy and my burden is light.’”\r\n\r\nHe had overcome the world vibration, and functioned in the fourth\r\ndimensional realm, where there is only perfection, completion, life and\r\njoy.\r\n\r\nHe said: “Come to me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will\r\ngive you rest.” “Take my yoke upon you, for my yoke is easy and my\r\nburden is light.”\r\n\r\nWe are also told in the fifty-fifth Psalm, to “cast thy burden upon the\r\nLord.” Many passages in the Bible state that the _battle is God’s_ not\r\nman’s and that man is always to _“stand still” and see the Salvation of\r\nthe Lord_.\r\n\r\nThis indicates that the superconscious mind (or Christ within) is the\r\ndepartment which fights man’s battle and relieves him of burdens.\r\n\r\nWe see, therefore, that man violates law if he carries a burden, and\r\na burden is an adverse thought or condition, and this thought or\r\ncondition has its root in the subconscious.\r\n\r\nIt seems almost impossible to make any headway directing the\r\nsubconscious from the conscious, or reasoning mind, as the reasoning\r\nmind (the intellect) is limited in its conceptions, and filled with\r\ndoubts and fears.\r\n\r\nHow scientific it then is, to cast the burden upon the superconscious\r\nmind (or Christ within) where it is “made light,” or dissolved into its\r\n“native nothingness.”\r\n\r\nFor example: A woman in urgent need of money, “made light” upon the\r\nChrist within, the superconscious, with the statement, “I cast this\r\nburden of lack on the Christ (within) and I go free to have plenty!”\r\n\r\nThe belief in lack was her burden, and as she cast it upon the\r\nSuperconscious with its belief of plenty, an avalanche of supply was\r\nthe result.\r\n\r\nWe read, “The Christ in you the hope of glory.”\r\n\r\nAnother example: One of my students had been given a new piano, and\r\nthere was no room in her studio for it until she had moved out the\r\nold one. She was in a state of perplexity. She wanted to keep the old\r\npiano, but knew of no place to send it. She became desperate, as the\r\nnew piano was to be sent immediately; in fact, was on its way, with no\r\nplace to put it. She said it came to her to repeat, “I cast this burden\r\non the Christ within, and I go free.”\r\n\r\nA few moments later, her ’phone rang, and a woman friend asked if she\r\nmight rent her old piano, and it was moved out, a few minutes before\r\nthe new one arrived.\r\n\r\nI knew a woman, whose burden was resentment. She said, “I cast this\r\nburden of resentment on the Christ within, and I go free, to be\r\nloving, harmonious and happy.” The Almighty superconscious, flooded\r\nthe subconscious with love, and her whole life was changed. For years,\r\nresentment had held her in a state of torment and imprisoned her soul\r\n(the subconscious mind).\r\n\r\nThe statement should be made over and over and over, sometimes for\r\nhours at a time, silently or audibly, with quietness but determination.\r\n\r\nI have often compared it to winding-up a victrola. We must wind\r\nourselves up with spoken words.\r\n\r\nI have noticed, in “casting the burden,” after a little while, one\r\nseems to see clearly. It is impossible to have clear vision, while in\r\nthe throes of carnal mind. Doubts and fear poison the mind and body and\r\nimagination runs riot, attracting disaster and disease.\r\n\r\nIn steadily repeating the affirmation, “I cast this burden on the\r\nChrist within, and go free,” the vision clears, and with it a feeling\r\nof relief, and sooner or later comes _the manifestation of good, be it\r\nhealth, happiness or supply_.\r\n\r\nOne of my students once asked me to explain the “darkness before the\r\ndawn.” I referred in a preceding chapter to the fact that often,\r\nbefore the big demonstration “everything seems to go wrong,” and\r\ndeep depression clouds the consciousness. It means that out of the\r\nsubconscious are rising the doubts and fears of the ages. These old\r\nderelicts of the subconscious rise to the surface, _to be put out_.\r\n\r\nIt is then, that man should clap his cymbals, like Jehoshaphat, and\r\ngive thanks that he is saved, even though he seems surrounded by the\r\nenemy (the situation of lack or disease). The student continued, “How\r\nlong must one remain in the dark” and I replied, “until one _can see in\r\nthe dark_,” and “_casting the burden enables one to see in the dark_.”\r\n\r\nIn order to impress the subconscious, active faith is always essential.\r\n\r\n“Faith without works is dead.” In these chapters I have endeavored to\r\nbring out this point.\r\n\r\nJesus Christ showed active faith when “He commanded the multitude to\r\nsit down on the ground,” before he gave thanks for the loaves and the\r\nfishes.\r\n\r\nI will give another example showing how necessary this step is. In\r\nfact, active faith is the bridge, over which man passes to his Promised\r\nLand.\r\n\r\nThrough misunderstanding, a woman had been separated from her husband,\r\nwhom she loved deeply. He refused all offers of reconciliation and\r\nwould not communicate with her in any way.\r\n\r\nComing into the knowledge of Spiritual law, she denied the appearance\r\nof separation. She made this statement: “There is no separation in\r\nDivine Mind, therefore, I cannot be separated from the love and\r\ncompanionship which are mine by divine right.”\r\n\r\nShe showed active faith by arranging a place for him at the table\r\nevery day; thereby impressing the subconscious with a picture of his\r\n_return_. Over a year passed, but she never wavered, and _one day he\r\nwalked in_.\r\n\r\nThe subconscious is often impressed through music. Music has a fourth\r\ndimensional quality and releases the soul from imprisonment. It makes\r\nwonderful things seem _possible, and easy of accomplishment_!\r\n\r\nI have a friend who uses her victrola, daily, for this purpose. It puts\r\nher in perfect harmony and releases the imagination.\r\n\r\nAnother woman often dances while making her affirmations. The rhythm\r\nand harmony of music and motion carry her words forth with tremendous\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe student must remember also, not to despise the “day of small\r\nthings.”\r\n\r\nInvariably, before a demonstration, come “signs of land.”\r\n\r\nBefore Columbus reached America, he saw birds and twigs which showed\r\nhim land was near. So it is with a demonstration; but often the student\r\nmistakes it for the demonstration itself, and is disappointed.\r\n\r\nFor example: A woman had “spoken the word” for a set of dishes. Not\r\nlong afterwards a friend gave her a dish which was old and cracked.\r\n\r\nShe came to me and said, “Well, I asked for a set of dishes, and all I\r\ngot was a cracked plate.”\r\n\r\nI replied, “The plate was only signs of land. It shows your dishes are\r\ncoming—look upon it as birds and seaweed,” and not long afterwards the\r\ndishes came.\r\n\r\nContinually “making-believe,” impresses the subconscious. If one makes\r\nbelieve he is rich, and makes believe he is successful, in “due time he\r\nwill reap.”\r\n\r\nChildren are always “making believe,” and “except ye be converted, and\r\nbecome as little children, ye shall not enter the Kingdom of Heaven.”\r\n\r\nFor example: I know of a woman who was very poor, but no one could\r\nmake her _feel poor_. She earned a small amount of money from rich\r\nfriends, who constantly reminded her of her poverty, and to be careful\r\nand saving. Regardless of their admonitions, she would spend all her\r\nearnings on a hat, or make someone a gift, and be in a rapturous state\r\nof mind. Her thoughts were always centered on beautiful clothes and\r\n“rings and things,” but without envying others.\r\n\r\nShe lived in the world of the wondrous, and only riches seemed\r\nreal to her. Before long she married a rich man, and the rings and\r\nthings became visible. I do not know whether the man was the “Divine\r\nSelection,” but opulence had to manifest in her life, as she had imaged\r\nonly opulence.\r\n\r\nThere is no peace or happiness for man, until he has erased all fear\r\nfrom the subconscious.\r\n\r\nFear is misdirected energy and must be redirected, or transmuted into\r\nFaith.\r\n\r\nJesus Christ said, “Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?” “All\r\nthings are possible to him that believeth.”\r\n\r\nI am asked, so often by my students, “_How can I get rid of fear?_”\r\n\r\nI reply, “_By walking up to the thing you are afraid of_.”\r\n\r\n“The lion takes its fierceness from your fear.”\r\n\r\nWalk up to the lion, and he will disappear; run away and he runs after\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nI have shown in previous chapters, how the lion of lack disappeared\r\nwhen the individual spent money fearlessly, showing faith that God was\r\nhis supply and therefore, unfailing.\r\n\r\nMany of my students have come out of the bondage of poverty, and are\r\nnow bountifully supplied, through losing all fear of letting money go\r\nout. The subconscious is impressed with the truth that _God is the\r\nGiver and the Gift_; therefore as one is one with the Giver, he is one\r\nwith the Gift. A splendid statement is, “I now thank God the Giver for\r\nGod the Gift.”\r\n\r\nMan has so long separated himself from his good and his supply, through\r\nthoughts of separation and lack, that sometimes, it takes dynamite to\r\ndislodge these false ideas from the subconscious, and the dynamite is a\r\nbig situation.\r\n\r\nWe see in the foregoing illustration, how the individual was freed from\r\nhis bondage by _showing fearlessness_.\r\n\r\nMan should watch himself hourly to detect if his motive for action is\r\nfear or faith.\r\n\r\n“Choose ye this day whom we shall serve,” fear or faith.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one’s fear is of personality. Then do not avoid the people\r\nfeared; be willing to meet them cheerfully, and they will either prove\r\n“golden links in the chain of one’s good,” or disappear harmoniously\r\nfrom one’s pathway.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one’s fear is of disease or germs. Then one should be fearless\r\nand undisturbed in a germ-laden situation, and he would be immune.\r\n\r\nOne can only contract germs while vibrating at the same rate as the\r\ngerm, and fear drags men down to the level of the germ. Of course, the\r\ndisease laden germ is the product of carnal mind, as all thought must\r\nobjectify. Germs do not exist in the superconscious or Divine Mind,\r\ntherefore are the product of man’s “vain imagination.”\r\n\r\n“In the twinkling of an eye,” man’s release will come when he realizes\r\n_there is no power in evil_.\r\n\r\nThe material world will fade away, and the fourth dimensional world,\r\nthe “World of the Wondrous,” will swing into manifestation.\r\n\r\n“And I saw a new heaven, and a new earth—and there shall be no more\r\ndeath, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain;\r\nfor the former things are passed away.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOVE\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery man on this planet is taking his initiation in love. “A new\r\ncommandment I give unto you, that ye love one another.” Ouspensky\r\nstates, in “Tertium Organum,” that “love is a cosmic phenomenon,” and\r\nopens to man the fourth dimensional world, “The World of the Wondrous.”\r\n\r\nReal love is selfless and free from fear. It pours itself out upon\r\nthe object of its affection, without demanding any return. Its joy is\r\nin the joy of giving. Love is God in manifestation, and the strongest\r\nmagnetic force in the universe. Pure, unselfish love _draws to itself\r\nits own_; it does not need to seek or demand. Scarcely anyone has the\r\nfaintest conception of real love. Man is selfish, tyrannical or fearful\r\nin his affections, thereby losing the thing he loves. Jealousy is the\r\nworst enemy of love, for the imagination runs riot, seeing the loved\r\none attracted to another, and invariably these fears objectify if they\r\nare not neutralized.\r\n\r\nFor example: A woman came to me in deep distress. The man she loved had\r\nleft her for other women, and said he never intended to marry her.\r\nShe was torn with jealousy and resentment and said she hoped he would\r\nsuffer as he had made her suffer; and added, “How could he leave me\r\nwhen I loved him so much?”\r\n\r\nI replied, “You are not loving that man, you are hating him,” and\r\nadded, “_You can never receive what you have never given. Give a\r\nperfect love and you will receive a perfect love._ Perfect yourself on\r\nthis man. Give him a perfect, _unselfish_ love, demanding nothing in\r\nreturn, do not criticise or condemn, and _bless him wherever he is_.”\r\n\r\nShe replied, “No, I won’t bless him unless I know where he is!”\r\n\r\n“Well,” I said, “that is not real love.”\r\n\r\n“When you _send out real love_, real love will return to you, either\r\nfrom this man or his equivalent, for if this man is not the divine\r\nselection, you will not want him. As you are one with God, you are one\r\nwith the love which belongs to you by divine right.”\r\n\r\nSeveral months passed, and matters remained about the same, but she\r\nwas working conscientiously with herself. I said, “When you are no\r\nlonger disturbed by his cruelty, he will cease to be cruel, as you are\r\nattracting it through your own emotions.”\r\n\r\nThen I told her of a brotherhood in India, who never said, “Good\r\nmorning” to each other. They used these words: “_I salute the Divinity\r\nin you._” They saluted the divinity in every man, and in the wild\r\nanimals in the jungle, and they were never harmed, for they _saw only\r\nGod in every_ living thing. I said, “Salute the divinity in this man,\r\nand say, ‘I see your divine self only. I see you as God sees you,\r\nperfect, made in His image and likeness.’”\r\n\r\nShe found she was becoming more poised, and gradually losing her\r\nresentment. He was a Captain, and she always called him “The Cap.”\r\n\r\nOne day, she said, suddenly, “_God bless the Cap wherever he is._”\r\n\r\nI replied: “Now, that is real love, and when you have become a\r\n‘complete circle,’ and are no longer disturbed by the situation, you\r\nwill have his love, or attract its equivalent.”\r\n\r\nI was moving at this time, and did not have a telephone, so was out of\r\ntouch with her for a few weeks, when one morning I received a letter\r\nsaying, “We are married.”\r\n\r\nAt the earliest opportunity, I paid her a call. My first words were,\r\n“What happened?”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” she exclaimed, “a miracle! One day I woke up and all suffering\r\nhad ceased. I saw him that evening and he asked me to marry him. We\r\nwere married in about a week, and I have never seen a more devoted man.”\r\n\r\nThere is an old saying: “_No man is your enemy, no man is your friend,\r\nevery man is your teacher._”\r\n\r\nSo one should become impersonal and learn what each man has to teach\r\nhim, and soon he would learn his lessons and be free.\r\n\r\nThe woman’s lover was teaching her selfless love, which every man,\r\nsooner or later, must learn.\r\n\r\nSuffering is not necessary for man’s development; it is the result\r\nof violation of spiritual law, but few people seem able to rouse\r\nthemselves from their “soul sleep” without it. When people are happy,\r\nthey usually become selfish, and automatically the law of Karma is set\r\nin action. Man often suffers loss through lack of appreciation.\r\n\r\nI knew a woman who had a very nice husband, but she said often, “I\r\ndon’t care anything about being married, but that is nothing against my\r\nhusband. I’m simply not interested in married life.”\r\n\r\nShe had other interests, and scarcely remembered she had a husband. She\r\nonly thought of him when she saw him. One day her husband told her he\r\nwas in love with another woman, and left. She came to me in distress\r\nand resentment.\r\n\r\nI replied, “It is exactly what you spoke the word for. You said you\r\ndidn’t care anything about being married, so the subconscious worked to\r\nget you unmarried.”\r\n\r\nShe said, “Oh yes, I see. People get what they want, and then feel very\r\nmuch hurt.”\r\n\r\nShe soon became in perfect harmony with the situation, and knew they\r\nwere both much happier apart.\r\n\r\nWhen a woman becomes indifferent or critical, and ceases to be an\r\ninspiration to her husband, he misses the stimulus of their early\r\nrelationship and is restless and unhappy.\r\n\r\nA man came to me dejected, miserable and poor. His wife was interested\r\nin the “Science of Numbers,” and had had him read. It seems the report\r\nwas not very favorable, for he said, “My wife says I’ll never amount to\r\nanything because I am a two.”\r\n\r\nI replied, “I don’t care what your number is, you are a perfect idea in\r\ndivine mind, and we will demand the success and prosperity which are\r\n_already planned_ for you by that Infinite Intelligence.”\r\n\r\nWithin a few weeks, he had a very fine position, and a year or two\r\nlater, he achieved a brilliant success as a writer. No man is a success\r\nin business unless he loves his work. The picture the artist paints\r\nfor love (of his art) is his greatest work. The pot-boiler is always\r\nsomething to live down.\r\n\r\nNo man can attract money if he despises it. Many people are kept in\r\npoverty by saying: “Money means nothing to me, and I have a contempt\r\nfor people who have it.”\r\n\r\nThis is the reason so many artists are poor. Their contempt for money\r\nseparates them from it.\r\n\r\nI remember hearing one artist say of another, “He’s no good as an\r\nartist, he has money in the bank.”\r\n\r\nThis attitude of mind, of course, separates man from his supply; he\r\nmust be in harmony with a thing in order to attract it.\r\n\r\nMoney is God in manifestation, as freedom from want and limitation, but\r\nit must be always kept in circulation and put to right uses. Hoarding\r\nand saving react with grim vengeance.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that man should not have houses and lots, stocks and\r\nbonds, for “the barns of the righteous man shall be full.” It means\r\nman should not hoard even the principal, if an occasion arises, when\r\nmoney is necessary. In letting it go out fearlessly and cheerfully he\r\nopens the way for more to come in, for God is man’s unfailing and\r\ninexhaustible supply.\r\n\r\nThis is the spiritual attitude towards money and the great Bank of the\r\nUniversal never fails!\r\n\r\nWe see an example of hoarding in the film production of “Greed.” The\r\nwoman won five thousand dollars in a lottery, but would not spend\r\nit. She hoarded and saved, let her husband suffer and starve, and\r\neventually she scrubbed floors for a living.\r\n\r\nShe loved the money itself and put it above everything, and one night\r\nshe was murdered and the money taken from her.\r\n\r\nThis is an example of where “love of money is the root of all evil.”\r\nMoney in itself, is good and beneficial, but used for destructive\r\npurposes, hoarded and saved, or considered more important than love,\r\nbrings disease and disaster, and the loss of the money itself.\r\n\r\nFollow the path of love, and all things are added, _for God is love_,\r\nand _God is supply_; follow the path of selfishness and greed, and the\r\nsupply vanishes, or man is separated from it.\r\n\r\nFor example; I knew the case of a very rich woman, who hoarded her\r\nincome. She rarely gave anything away, but bought and bought and bought\r\nthings for herself.\r\n\r\nShe was very fond of necklaces, and a friend once asked her how many\r\nshe possessed. She replied, “Sixty-seven.” She bought them and put them\r\naway, carefully wrapped in tissue paper. Had she used the necklaces it\r\nwould have been quite legitimate, but she was violating “the law of\r\nuse.” Her closets were filled with clothes she never wore, and jewels\r\nwhich never saw the light.\r\n\r\nThe woman’s arms were gradually becoming paralyzed from holding on to\r\nthings, and eventually she was considered incapable of looking after\r\nher affairs and her wealth was handed over to others to manage.\r\n\r\nSo man, in ignorance of the law, brings about his own destruction.\r\n\r\nAll disease, all unhappiness, come from the violation of the law of\r\nlove. Man’s boomerangs of hate, resentment and criticism, come back\r\nladen with sickness and sorrow. Love seems almost a lost art, but the\r\nman with the knowledge of spiritual law knows it must be regained, for\r\nwithout it, he has “become as sounding brass and tinkling cymbals.”\r\n\r\nFor example: I had a student who came to me, month after month, to\r\nclean her consciousness of resentment. After a while, she arrived at\r\nthe point where she resented only one woman, but that one woman kept\r\nher busy. Little by little she became poised and harmonious, and one\r\nday, all resentment was wiped out.\r\n\r\nShe came in radiant, and exclaimed “You can’t understand how I feel!\r\nThe woman said something to me and instead of being furious I was\r\nloving and kind, and she apologized and was perfectly lovely to me.\r\n\r\nNo one can understand the marvelous lightness I feel within!”\r\n\r\nLove and good-will are invaluable in business.\r\n\r\nFor example: A woman came to me, complaining of her employer. She said\r\nshe was cold and critical and knew she did not want her in the position.\r\n\r\n“Well,” I replied, “Salute the Divinity in the woman and send her love.”\r\n\r\nShe said “I can’t; she’s a marble woman.”\r\n\r\nI answered, “You remember the story of the sculptor who asked for a\r\ncertain piece of marble. He was asked why he wanted it, and he replied,\r\n‘because there is an angel in the marble,’ and out of it he produced a\r\nwonderful work of art.”\r\n\r\nShe said, “Very well, I’ll try it.” A week later she came back and\r\nsaid, “I did what you told me to, and now the woman is very kind, and\r\ntook me out in her car.”\r\n\r\nPeople are sometimes filled with remorse for having done someone an\r\nunkindness, perhaps years ago.\r\n\r\nIf the wrong cannot be righted, its effect can be neutralized by doing\r\nsome one a kindness _in the present_.\r\n\r\n“This one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and\r\nreaching forth unto those things which are before.”\r\n\r\nSorrow, regret and remorse tear down the cells of the body, and poison\r\nthe atmosphere of the individual.\r\n\r\nA woman said to me in deep sorrow, “Treat me to be happy and joyous,\r\nfor my sorrow makes me so irritable with the members of my family that\r\nI keep making more Karma.”\r\n\r\nI was asked to treat a woman who was mourning for her daughter. I\r\ndenied all belief in loss and separation, and affirmed that God was the\r\nwoman’s joy, love and peace.\r\n\r\nThe woman gained her poise at once, but sent word by her son, not to\r\ntreat any longer, because she was “so happy, it wasn’t respectable.”\r\n\r\nSo “mortal mind” loves to hang on to its griefs and regrets.\r\n\r\nI knew a woman who went about bragging of her troubles, so, of course,\r\nshe always had something to brag about.\r\n\r\nThe old idea was if a woman did not worry about her children, she was\r\nnot a good mother.\r\n\r\nNow, we know that mother-fear is responsible for many of the diseases\r\nand accidents which come into the lives of children.\r\n\r\nFor fear pictures vividly the disease or situation feared, and these\r\npictures objectify, if not neutralized.\r\n\r\nHappy is the mother who can say sincerely, that she puts her child in\r\nGod’s hands, and _knows_ therefore, that he is divinely protected.\r\n\r\nFor example: A woman awoke suddenly, in the night, feeling her brother\r\nwas in great danger. Instead of giving in to her fears, she commenced\r\nmaking statements of Truth, saying, “Man is a perfect idea in Divine\r\nMind, and is always in his right place, therefore, my brother is in his\r\nright place, and is divinely protected.”\r\n\r\nThe next day she found that her brother had been in close proximity to\r\nan explosion in a mine, but had miraculously escaped.\r\n\r\nSo man is his brother’s keeper (in thought) and every man should know\r\nthat the thing he loves dwells in “the secret place of the most high,\r\nand abides under the shadow of the Almighty.”\r\n\r\n“There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh\r\nthy dwelling.”\r\n\r\n“Perfect love casteth out fear. He that feareth is not made perfect in\r\nlove,” and “Love is the fulfilling of the Law.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTUITION OR GUIDANCE\r\n\r\n “In all thy ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct thy paths.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is nothing too great of accomplishment for the man who knows the\r\npower of his word, and who follows his intuitive leads. By the word he\r\nstarts in action unseen forces and can rebuild his body or remold his\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, of the utmost importance to choose the right words,\r\nand the student carefully selects the affirmation he wishes to catapult\r\ninto the invisible.\r\n\r\nHe knows that God is his supply, that there is a supply for every\r\ndemand, and that his spoken word releases this supply.\r\n\r\n“Ask and ye shall receive.”\r\n\r\nMan must make the first move. “Draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh\r\nto you.”\r\n\r\nI have often been asked just how to make a demonstration.\r\n\r\nI reply: “Speak the word and then do not do anything until you get a\r\ndefinite lead.” Demand the lead, saying, “Infinite Spirit, reveal to me\r\nthe way, let me know if there is anything for me to do.”\r\n\r\nThe answer will come through intuition (or hunch); a chance remark from\r\nsomeone, or a passage in a book, etc., etc. The answers are sometimes\r\nquite startling in their exactness. For example: A woman desired a\r\nlarge sum of money. She spoke the words: “Infinite Spirit, open the\r\nway for my immediate supply, let all that is mine by divine right now\r\nreach me, in great avalanches of abundance.” Then she added: “Give me a\r\ndefinite lead, let me know if there is anything for me to do.”\r\n\r\nThe thought came quickly, “Give a certain friend” (who had helped her\r\nspiritually) “a hundred dollars.” She told her friend, who said, “Wait\r\nand get another lead, before giving it.” So she waited, and that day\r\nmet a woman who said to her, “I gave someone a dollar today; it was\r\njust as much for me, as it would be for you to give someone a hundred.”\r\n\r\nThis was indeed an unmistakable lead, so she knew she was right\r\nin giving the hundred dollars. It was a gift which proved a great\r\ninvestment, for shortly after that, a large sum of money came to her in\r\na remarkable way.\r\n\r\nGiving opens the way for receiving. In order to create activity in\r\nfinances, one should give. Tithing or giving one-tenth of one’s income,\r\nis an old Jewish custom, and is sure to bring increase. Many of the\r\nrichest men in this country have been tithers, and I have never known\r\nit to fail as an investment.\r\n\r\nThe tenth-part goes forth and returns blessed and multiplied. But the\r\ngift or tithe must be given with love and cheerfulness, for “God loveth\r\na cheerful giver.” Bills should be paid cheerfully; all money should\r\nbe sent forth fearlessly and with a blessing.\r\n\r\nThis attitude of mind makes man master of money. It is his to obey, and\r\nhis spoken word then opens vast reservoirs of wealth.\r\n\r\nMan, himself, limits his supply by his limited vision. Sometimes the\r\nstudent has a great realization of wealth, but is afraid to act.\r\n\r\nThe vision and action must go hand in hand, as in the case of the man\r\nwho bought the fur-lined overcoat.\r\n\r\nA woman came to me asking me to “speak the word” for a position. So\r\nI demanded: “Infinite Spirit, open the way for this woman’s right\r\nposition.” Never ask for just “a position”; ask for the right position,\r\nthe place already planned in Divine Mind, as it is the only one that\r\nwill give satisfaction.\r\n\r\nI then gave thanks that she had already received, and that it would\r\nmanifest quickly. Very soon, she had three positions offered her,\r\ntwo in New York and one in Palm Beach, and she did not know which to\r\nchoose. I said, “Ask for a definite lead.”\r\n\r\nThe time was almost up and was still undecided, when one day, she\r\ntelephoned, “When I woke up this morning, I could smell Palm Beach.”\r\nShe had been there before and knew its balmy fragrance.\r\n\r\nI replied: “Well, if you can smell Palm Beach from here, it is\r\ncertainly your lead.” She accepted the position, and it proved a great\r\nsuccess. Often one’s lead comes at an unexpected time.\r\n\r\nOne day, I was walking down the street, when I suddenly felt a strong\r\nurge to go to a certain bakery, a block or two away.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning mind resisted, arguing, “There is nothing there that you\r\nwant.”\r\n\r\nHowever, I had learned not to reason, so I went to the bakery, looked\r\nat everything, and there was certainly nothing there that I wanted, but\r\ncoming out I encountered a woman I had thought of often, and who was in\r\ngreat need of the help which I could give her.\r\n\r\nSo often, one goes for one thing and finds another.\r\n\r\nIntuition is a spiritual faculty and does not explain, but simply\r\n_points the way_.\r\n\r\nA person often receives a lead during a “treatment.” The idea that\r\ncomes may seem quite irrelevant, but some of God’s leadings are\r\n“mysterious.”\r\n\r\nIn the class, one day, I was treating that each individual would\r\nreceive a definite lead. A woman came to me afterwards, and said:\r\n“While you were treating, I got the hunch to take my furniture out\r\nof storage and get an apartment.” The woman had come to be treated\r\nfor health. I told her I knew in getting a home of her own, her\r\nhealth would improve, and I added, “I believe your trouble, which is\r\na congestion, has come from having things stored away. Congestion of\r\nthings causes congestion in the body. You have violated the law of use,\r\nand your body is paying the penalty.”\r\n\r\nSo I gave thanks that “_Divine order was established in her mind, body\r\nand affairs_.”\r\n\r\nPeople little dream of how their affairs react on the body. There is\r\na mental correspondence for every disease. A person might receive\r\ninstantaneous healing through the realization of his body being a\r\nperfect idea in Divine Mind, and, therefore, whole and perfect, but\r\nif he continues his destructive thinking, hoarding, hating, fearing,\r\ncondemning, the disease will return.\r\n\r\nJesus Christ knew that all sickness came from sin, but admonished the\r\nleper after the healing, to go and sin no more, lest a worse thing come\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nSo man’s soul (or subconscious mind) must be washed whiter than snow,\r\nfor permanent healing; and the metaphysician is always delving deep for\r\nthe “correspondence.”\r\n\r\nJesus Christ said, “Condemn not lest ye also be condemned.”\r\n\r\n“Judge not, lest ye be judged.”\r\n\r\nMany people have attracted disease and unhappiness through condemnation\r\nof others.\r\n\r\nWhat man condemns in others, he attracts to himself.\r\n\r\nFor example: A friend came to me in anger and distress, because her\r\nhusband had deserted her for another woman. She condemned the other\r\nwoman, and said continually, “She knew he was a married man, and had no\r\nright to accept his attentions.”\r\n\r\nI replied, “Stop condemning the woman, bless her, and be through\r\nwith the situation, otherwise, you are attracting the same thing to\r\nyourself.”\r\n\r\nShe was deaf to my words, and a year or two later, became deeply\r\ninterested in a married man, herself.\r\n\r\nMan picks up a live-wire whenever he criticises or condemns, and may\r\nexpect a shock.\r\n\r\nIndecision is a stumbling-block in many a pathway. In order to\r\novercome it, make the statement, repeatedly, “_I am always under direct\r\ninspiration; I make right decisions, quickly._”\r\n\r\nThese words impress the subconscious, and soon one finds himself awake\r\nand alert, making his right moves without hesitation. I have found it\r\ndestructive to look to the psychic plane for guidance, as it is the\r\nplane of many minds and not “The One Mind.”\r\n\r\nAs man opens his mind to subjectivity, he becomes a target for\r\ndestructive forces. The psychic plane is the result of man’s mortal\r\nthought, and is on the “plane of opposites.” He may receive either good\r\nor bad messages.\r\n\r\nThe science of numbers and the reading of horoscopes, keep man down on\r\nthe mental (or mortal) plane, for they deal only with the Karmic path.\r\n\r\nI know of a man who should have been dead, years ago, according to his\r\nhoroscope, but he is alive and a leader of one of the biggest movements\r\nin this country for the uplift of humanity.\r\n\r\nIt takes a very strong mind to neutralize a prophecy of evil. The\r\nstudent should declare, “Every false prophecy shall come to naught;\r\nevery plan my Father in heaven has not planned, shall be dissolved and\r\ndissipated, the divine idea now comes to pass.”\r\n\r\nHowever, if any good message has ever been given one, of coming\r\nhappiness, or wealth, harbor and expect it, and it will manifest sooner\r\nor later, through the law of expectancy.\r\n\r\nMan’s will should be used to back the universal will. “I will that the\r\nwill of God be done.”\r\n\r\nIt is God’s will to give every man, every righteous desire of his\r\nheart, and man’s will should be used to hold the perfect vision,\r\nwithout wavering.\r\n\r\nThe prodigal son said: “I will arise and go to my Father.”\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, often an effort of the will to leave the husks and swine\r\nof mortal thinking. It is so much easier, for the average person, to\r\nhave fear than faith; _so faith is an effort of the will_.\r\n\r\nAs man becomes spiritually awakened he recognizes that any external\r\ninharmony is the correspondence of mental inharmony. If he stumbles or\r\nfalls, he may know he is stumbling or falling in consciousness.\r\n\r\nOne day, a student was walking along the street condemning someone\r\nin her thoughts. She was saying, mentally, “That woman is the most\r\ndisagreeable woman on earth,” when suddenly three boy scouts rushed\r\naround the corner and almost knocked her over. She did not condemn\r\nthe boy scouts, but immediately called on the law of forgiveness,\r\nand “saluted the divinity” in the woman. Wisdom’s ways are ways of\r\npleasantness and all her paths are peace.\r\n\r\nWhen one has made his demands upon the Universal, he must be ready for\r\nsurprises. Everything may seem to be going wrong, when in reality, it\r\nis going right.\r\n\r\nFor example: A woman was told that there was no loss in divine mind,\r\ntherefore, she could not lose anything which belonged to her; anything\r\nlost, would be returned, or she would receive its equivalent.\r\n\r\nSeveral years previously, she had lost two thousand dollars. She had\r\nloaned the money to a relative during her lifetime, but the relative\r\nhad died, leaving no mention of it in her will. The woman was resentful\r\nand angry, and as she had no written statement of the transaction,\r\nshe never received the money, so she determined to deny the loss, and\r\ncollect the two thousand dollars from the Bank of the Universal. She\r\nhad to begin by forgiving the woman, as resentment and unforgiveness\r\nclose the doors of this wonderful bank.\r\n\r\nShe made this statement, “I deny loss, there is no loss in Divine Mind,\r\ntherefore, I cannot lose the two thousand dollars, which belong to me\r\nby divine right.” “_As one door shuts another door opens._”\r\n\r\nShe was living in an apartment house which was for sale; and in the\r\nlease was a clause, stating that if the house was sold, the tenants\r\nwould be required to move out within ninety days.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, the landlord broke the leases and raised the rent. Again,\r\ninjustice was on her pathway, but this time she was undisturbed. She\r\nblessed the landlord, and said, “As the rent has been raised, it means\r\nthat I’ll be that much richer, for God is my supply.”\r\n\r\nNew leases were made out for the advanced rent, but by some divine\r\nmistake, the ninety days clause had been forgotten. Soon after, the\r\nlandlord had an opportunity to sell the house. On account of the\r\nmistake in the new leases, the tenants held possession for another year.\r\n\r\nThe agent offered each tenant two hundred dollars if he would vacate.\r\nSeveral families moved; three remained, including the woman. A month\r\nor two passed, and the agent again appeared. This time he said to\r\nthe woman, “Will you break your lease for the sum of fifteen hundred\r\ndollars?” It flashed upon her, “Here comes the two thousand dollars.”\r\nShe remembered having said to friends in the house, “We will all act\r\ntogether if anything more is said about leaving.” So her _lead_ was to\r\nconsult her friends.\r\n\r\nThese friends said: “Well, if they have offered you fifteen hundred\r\nthey will certainly give two thousand.” So she received a check for\r\ntwo thousand dollars for giving up the apartment. It was certainly a\r\nremarkable working of the law, and the apparent injustice was merely\r\nopening the way for her demonstration.\r\n\r\nIt proved that there is no loss, and when man takes his spiritual\r\nstand, he collects all that is his from this great Reservoir of Good.\r\n\r\n“I will restore to you the years the locusts have eaten.”\r\n\r\nThe locusts are the doubts, fears, resentments and regrets of mortal\r\nthinking.\r\n\r\nThese adverse thoughts, alone, rob man; for “No man gives to himself\r\nbut himself, and no man takes away from himself, but himself.”\r\n\r\nMan is here to prove God and “to bear witness to the truth,” and he\r\ncan only prove God by bringing plenty out of lack, and justice out of\r\ninjustice.\r\n\r\n“Prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you\r\nthe windows of heaven, and pour out a blessing, that there shall not be\r\nroom enough to receive it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERFECT SELF-EXPRESSION\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nTHE DIVINE DESIGN\r\n\r\n    “No wind can drive my bark astray\r\n    nor change the tide of destiny.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is for each man, perfect self-expression. There is a place which\r\nhe is to fill and no one else can fill, something which he is to do,\r\nwhich no one else can do; it is his destiny!\r\n\r\nThis achievement is held, a perfect idea in Divine Mind, awaiting man’s\r\nrecognition. As the imaging faculty is the creative faculty, it is\r\nnecessary for man to see the idea, before it can manifest.\r\n\r\nSo man’s highest demand is for the _Divine Design of his life_.\r\n\r\nHe may not have the faintest conception of what it is, for there is,\r\npossibly, some marvelous talent, hidden deep within him.\r\n\r\nHis demand should be: “_Infinite Spirit, open the way for the Divine\r\nDesign of my life to manifest; let the genius within me now be\r\nreleased; let me see clearly the perfect plan._”\r\n\r\nThe perfect plan includes health, wealth, love and perfect\r\nself-expression. This is the _square of life_, which brings perfect\r\nhappiness. When one has made this demand, he may find great changes\r\ntaking place in his life, for nearly every man has wandered far from\r\nthe Divine Design.\r\n\r\nI know, in one woman’s case, it was as though a cyclone had struck\r\nher affairs, but readjustments came quickly, and new and wonderful\r\nconditions took the place of old ones.\r\n\r\nPerfect self-expression will never be labor; but of such absorbing\r\ninterest that it will seem almost like play. The student knows, also,\r\nas man comes into the world financed by God, the _supply_ needed for\r\nhis perfect self-expression will be at hand.\r\n\r\nMany a genius has struggled for years with the problem of supply, when\r\nhis spoken word, and faith, would have released quickly, the necessary\r\nfunds.\r\n\r\nFor example: After the class, one day, a man came to me and handed me a\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nHe said: “I have just seven cents in the world, and I’m going to give\r\nyou one; for I have faith in the power of your spoken word. I want you\r\nto speak the word for my perfect self-expression and prosperity.”\r\n\r\nI “spoke the word,” and did not see him again until a year later. He\r\ncame in one day, successful and happy, with a roll of yellow bills in\r\nhis pocket. He said, “Immediately after you spoke the word, I had a\r\nposition offered me in a distant city, and am now demonstrating health,\r\nhappiness and supply.”\r\n\r\nA woman’s perfect self-expression may be in becoming a perfect wife,\r\na perfect mother, a perfect home-maker and not necessarily in having a\r\npublic career.\r\n\r\nDemand definite leads, and the way will be made easy and successful.\r\n\r\nOne should not visualize or force a mental picture. When he demands\r\nthe Divine Design to come into his conscious mind, he will receive\r\nflashes of inspiration, and begin to see himself making some great\r\naccomplishment. This is the picture, or idea, he must hold without\r\nwavering.\r\n\r\nThe thing man seeks is seeking him—_the telephone was seeking Bell_!\r\n\r\nParents should never force careers and professions upon their children.\r\nWith a knowledge of spiritual Truth, the Divine Plan could be spoken\r\nfor, early in childhood, or prenatally.\r\n\r\nA prenatal treatment should be: “Let the God in this child have perfect\r\nexpression; let the Divine Design of his mind, body and affairs be made\r\nmanifest throughout his life, throughout eternity.”\r\n\r\n_God’s will be done, not man’s; God’s pattern, not man’s_ pattern, is\r\nthe command we find running through all the scriptures, and the Bible\r\nis a book dealing with the science of the mind. It is a book telling\r\nman how to release his soul (or subconscious mind) from bondage.\r\n\r\nThe battles described are pictures of man waging war against mortal\r\nthoughts. “A man’s foes shall be they of his own household.” Every\r\nman is Jehoshaphat, and every man is David, who slays Goliath (mortal\r\nthinking) with the little white stone (faith).\r\n\r\nSo man must be careful that he is not the “wicked and slothful servant”\r\nwho buried his talent. There is a terrible penalty to be paid for not\r\nusing one’s ability.\r\n\r\nOften fear stands between man and his perfect self-expression.\r\nStage-fright has hampered many a genius. This may be overcome\r\nby the spoken word, or treatment. The individual then loses all\r\nself-consciousness, and feels simply that he is a channel for Infinite\r\nIntelligence to express Itself through.\r\n\r\nHe is under direct inspiration, fearless, and confident; for he feels\r\nthat it is the “Father within” him who does the work.\r\n\r\nA young boy came often to my class with his mother. He asked me to\r\n“speak the word” for his coming examinations at school.\r\n\r\nI told him to make the statement: “I am one with Infinite Intelligence.\r\nI know everything I should know on this subject.” He had an excellent\r\nknowledge of history, but was not sure of his arithmetic. I saw him\r\nafterwards, and he said: “I spoke the word for my arithmetic, and\r\npassed with the highest honors; but thought I could depend on myself\r\nfor history, and got a very poor mark.” Man often receives a set-back\r\nwhen he is “too sure of himself,” which means he is trusting to his\r\npersonality and not the “Father within.”\r\n\r\nAnother one of my students gave me an example of this. She took an\r\nextended trip abroad one summer, visiting many countries, where she was\r\nignorant of the languages. She was calling for guidance and protection\r\nevery minute, and her affairs went smoothly and miraculously. Her\r\nluggage was never delayed nor lost! Accommodations were always ready\r\nfor her at the best hotels; and she had perfect service wherever she\r\nwent. She returned to New York. Knowing the language, she felt God was\r\nno longer necessary, so looked after her affairs in an ordinary manner.\r\n\r\n_Everything went wrong_, her trunks delayed, amid inharmony and\r\nconfusion. The student must form the habit of “practicing the Presence\r\nof God” every minute. “_In all thy ways acknowledge him_;” nothing is\r\ntoo small or too great.\r\n\r\nSometimes an insignificant incident may be the turning point in a man’s\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nRobert Fulton, watching some boiling water, simmering in a tea kettle,\r\nsaw a steamboat!\r\n\r\nI have seen a student, often, keep back his demonstration, through\r\nresistance, or pointing the way.\r\n\r\nHe pins his faith to one channel only, and dictates just the way he\r\ndesires the manifestation to come, which brings things to a standstill.\r\n\r\n“_My way, not your way!_” is the command of Infinite Intelligence. Like\r\nall Power, be it steam or electricity, it must have a nonresistant\r\nengine or instrument to work through, and man is that engine or\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nOver and over again, man is told to “stand still”. “Oh Judah, fear not;\r\nbut tomorrow go out against them, for the Lord will be with you. You\r\nshall not need to fight this battle; set yourselves, stand ye still,\r\nand see the salvation of the Lord with you.”\r\n\r\nWe see this in the incidents of the two thousand dollars coming to\r\nthe woman through the landlord when she became _nonresistant_ and\r\n_undisturbed_, and the woman who won the man’s love “after all\r\nsuffering had ceased.”\r\n\r\nThe student’s goal is _Poise!_ _Poise_ is _Power_, for it gives\r\nGod-Power a chance to rush through man, to “will and to do Its good\r\npleasure.”\r\n\r\nPoised, he thinks clearly, and makes “right decisions quickly.” “He\r\nnever misses a trick.”\r\n\r\nAnger blurs the visions, poisons the blood, is the root of many\r\ndiseases, and causes wrong decision leading to failure.\r\n\r\nIt has been named one of the worst “sins,” as its reaction is so\r\nharmful. The student learns that in metaphysics sin has a much broader\r\nmeaning than in the old teaching. “Whatsoever is not of faith is sin.”\r\n\r\nHe finds that fear and worry are deadly sins. They are inverted faith,\r\nand through distorted mental pictures, bring to pass the thing he\r\nfears. His work is to drive out these enemies (from the subconscious\r\nmind). “When Man is _fearless he is finished_!” Maeterlinck says, that\r\n“Man is God afraid.”\r\n\r\nSo, as we read in the previous chapters: Man can only vanquish fear by\r\nwalking up to the thing he is afraid of. When Jehoshaphat and his army\r\nprepared to meet the enemy, singing “Praise the Lord, for his mercy\r\nendureth forever,” they found their enemies had destroyed each other,\r\nand there was nothing to fight.\r\n\r\nFor example: A woman asked a friend to deliver a message to another\r\nfriend. The woman feared to give the message, as the reasoning mind\r\nsaid, “Don’t get mixed-up in this affair, don’t give that message.”\r\n\r\nShe was troubled in spirit, for she had given her promise. At last,\r\nshe determined to “walk up to the lion,” and call on the law of divine\r\nprotection. She met the friend to whom she was to deliver the message.\r\nShe opened her mouth to speak it, when her friend said, “So-and-So\r\nhas left town.” This made it unnecessary to give the message, as the\r\nsituation depended upon the person being in town. As she was willing\r\nto do it, she was not obliged to; as she did not fear, the situation\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\nThe student often delays his demonstration through a belief in\r\nincompletion. He should make this statement:\r\n\r\n“In Divine Mind there is only completion, therefore, my demonstration\r\nis completed. My perfect work, my perfect home, my perfect health.”\r\nWhatever he demands are perfect ideas registered in Divine Mind, and\r\nmust manifest, “under grace in a perfect way.” He gives thanks he has\r\nalready received on the invisible, and makes active preparation for\r\nreceiving on the visible.\r\n\r\nOne of my students was in need of a financial demonstration. She came\r\nto me and asked why it was not completed.\r\n\r\nI replied: “Perhaps, you are in the habit of leaving things unfinished,\r\nand the subconscious has gotten into the habit of not completing (as\r\nthe without, so the within).”\r\n\r\nShe said, “You are right. I often _begin things_ and never finish them.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll go home and finish something I commenced weeks ago, and I know it\r\nwill be symbolic of my demonstration.”\r\n\r\nSo she sewed assiduously, and the article was soon completed. Shortly\r\nafter, the money came in a most curious manner.\r\n\r\nHer husband was paid his salary twice that month. He told the people of\r\ntheir mistake, and they sent word to keep it.\r\n\r\nWhen man asks, _believing, he must receive, for God creates His own\r\nchannels_!\r\n\r\nI have been sometimes asked, “Suppose one has several talents, how is\r\nhe to know which one to choose?” Demand to be shown definitely. Say:\r\n“Infinite Spirit, give me a definite lead, reveal to me my perfect\r\nself-expression, show me which talent I am to make use of now.”\r\n\r\nI have known people to suddenly enter a new line of work, and be fully\r\nequipped, with little or no training. So make the statement: “_I am\r\nfully equipped for the Divine Plan of my life_,” and be fearless in\r\ngrasping opportunities.\r\n\r\nSome people are cheerful givers, but bad receivers. They refuse\r\ngifts through pride, or some negative reason, thereby blocking their\r\nchannels, and invariably find themselves eventually with little or\r\nnothing. For example: A woman who had given away a great deal of money,\r\nhad a gift offered her of several thousand dollars. She refused to take\r\nit, saying she did not need it. Shortly after that, her finances were\r\n“tied up,” and she found herself in debt for that amount. Man should\r\nreceive gracefully the bread returning to him upon the water—freely ye\r\nhave given, freely ye shall receive.\r\n\r\nThere is always the perfect balance of giving and receiving, and\r\nthough man should give without thinking of returns, he violates law if\r\nhe does not accept the returns which come to him; for all gifts are\r\nfrom God, man being merely the channel.\r\n\r\nA thought of lack should never be held over the giver.\r\n\r\nFor example: When the man gave me the one cent, I did not say: “Poor\r\nman, he cannot afford to give me that.” I saw him rich and prosperous,\r\nwith his supply pouring in. It was this thought which brought it.\r\nIf one has been a bad receiver, he must become a good one, and take\r\neven a postage stamp if it is given him, and open up his channels for\r\nreceiving.\r\n\r\nThe Lord loveth a cheerful receiver, as well as a cheerful giver.\r\n\r\nI have often been asked why one man is born rich and healthy, and\r\nanother poor and sick.\r\n\r\nWhere there is an effect there is always a cause; there is no such\r\nthing as chance.\r\n\r\nThis question is answered through the law of reincarnation. Man goes\r\nthrough many births and deaths, until he knows the truth which sets him\r\nfree.\r\n\r\nHe is drawn back to the earth plane through unsatisfied desire, to pay\r\nhis Karmic debts, or to “fulfill his destiny.”\r\n\r\nThe man born rich and healthy has had pictures in his subconscious\r\nmind, in his past life, of health and riches; and the poor and sick\r\nman, of disease and poverty. Man manifests, on any plane, the sum total\r\nof his subconscious beliefs.\r\n\r\nHowever, birth and death are man-made laws, for the “wages of sin is\r\ndeath”; the Adamic fall in consciousness through the belief in _two\r\npowers_. The real man, spiritual man, is birthless and deathless! He\r\nnever was born and has never died—“As he was in the beginning, he is\r\nnow, and ever shall be!”\r\n\r\nSo through the truth, man is set free from the law of Karma, sin\r\nand death, and manifests the man made in “His image and likeness.”\r\nMan’s freedom comes through fulfilling his destiny, bringing into\r\nmanifestation the Divine Design of his life.\r\n\r\nHis lord will say unto him: “Well done thou good and faithful servant,\r\nthou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler\r\nover many things (death itself); enter thou into the joy of thy Lord\r\n(eternal life).”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDENIALS AND AFFIRMATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n“Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee.”\r\n\r\nAll the good that is to be made manifest in man’s life is already\r\nan accomplished fact in divine mind, and is released through man’s\r\nrecognition, or spoken word, so he must be careful to decree that only\r\nthe Divine Idea be made manifest, for often, he decrees, through his\r\n“idle words,” failure or misfortune.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, of the utmost importance, to word one’s demands\r\ncorrectly, as stated in a previous chapter.\r\n\r\nIf one desires a home, friend, position or any other good thing, make\r\nthe demand for the “divine selection.”\r\n\r\nFor example: “Infinite Spirit, open the way for my right home, my right\r\nfriend, my right position. I give thanks _it now manifests under grace\r\nin a perfect way_.”\r\n\r\nThe latter part of the statement is most important. For example: I\r\nknew a woman who demanded a thousand dollars. Her daughter was injured\r\nand they received a thousand dollars indemnity, so it did not come\r\nin a “perfect way.” The demand should have been worded in this way:\r\n“Infinite Spirit, I give thanks that the one thousand dollars, which is\r\nmine by divine right, is now released, and reaches me under grace, in a\r\nperfect way.”\r\n\r\nAs one grows in a financial consciousness, he should demand that the\r\nenormous sums of money, which are his by divine right, reach him under\r\ngrace, in perfect ways.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for man to release more than he thinks is possible,\r\nfor one is bound by the limited expectancies of the subconscious. He\r\nmust enlarge his expectancies in order to receive in a larger way.\r\n\r\nMan so often limits himself in his demands. For example: A student made\r\nthe demand for six hundred dollars, by a certain date. He did receive\r\nit, but heard afterwards, that he came very near receiving a thousand\r\ndollars, but he was given just six hundred, as the result of his spoken\r\nword.\r\n\r\n“They limited the Holy One of Israel.” Wealth is a matter of\r\nconsciousness. The French have a legend giving an example of this. A\r\npoor man was walking along a road when he met a traveler, who stopped\r\nhim and said: “My good friend, I see you are poor. Take this gold\r\nnugget, sell it, and you will be rich all your days.”\r\n\r\nThe man was overjoyed at his good fortune, and took the nugget home. He\r\nimmediately found work and became so prosperous that he did not sell\r\nthe nugget. Years passed, and he became a very rich man. One day he met\r\na poor man on the road. He stopped him and said: “My good friend, I\r\nwill give you this gold nugget, which, if you sell, will make you rich\r\nfor life.” The mendicant took the nugget, had it valued, and found it\r\nwas only brass. So we see, the first man became rich through feeling\r\nrich, thinking the nugget was gold.\r\n\r\nEvery man has within himself a gold nugget; _it is his consciousness of\r\ngold, of opulence, which brings riches into his life_. In making his\r\ndemands, man begins at his _journey’s end_, that is, he declares _he\r\nhas already received_. “_Before_ ye call I shall answer.”\r\n\r\nContinually affirming establishes the belief in the subconscious.\r\n\r\nIt would not be necessary to make an affirmation more than once if one\r\nhad perfect faith! One should not plead or supplicate, but give thanks\r\nrepeatedly, that he has received.\r\n\r\n“The desert shall _rejoice_ and blossom as the rose.” This rejoicing\r\nwhich is yet in the desert (state of consciousness) opens the way\r\nfor release. The Lord’s Prayer is in the form of command and demand,\r\n“Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts as we\r\nforgive our debtors,” and ends in praise, “For thine is the Kingdom\r\nand the Power and the Glory, forever. Amen.” “Concerning the works of\r\nmy hands, command ye me.” So prayer is command and demand, praise and\r\nthanksgiving. The student’s work is in making himself believe that\r\n“with God all things are possible.”\r\n\r\nThis is easy enough to state in the abstract, but a little more\r\ndifficult when confronted with a problem. For example: It was\r\nnecessary for a woman to demonstrate a large sum of money within a\r\nstated time. She knew she must _do something_ to get a realization (for\r\nrealization is manifestation), and she demanded a “lead.”\r\n\r\nShe was walking through a department store, when she saw a very\r\nbeautiful pink enamel papercutter. She felt the “pull” towards it. The\r\nthought came. “I haven’t a paper cutter good enough to open letters\r\ncontaining large cheques.”\r\n\r\nSo she bought the papercutter, which the reasoning mind would have\r\ncalled an extravagance. When she held it in her hand, she had a flash\r\nof a picture of herself opening an envelope containing a large cheque,\r\nand in a few weeks, she received the money. The pink papercutter was\r\nher bridge of active faith.\r\n\r\nMany stories are told of the power of the subconscious when directed in\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nFor example: A man was spending the night in a farmhouse. The windows\r\nof the room had been nailed down, and in the middle of the night he\r\nfelt suffocated and made his way in the dark to the window. He could\r\nnot open it, so he smashed the pane with his fist, drew in draughts of\r\nfine fresh air, and had a wonderful night’s sleep.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, he found he had smashed the glass of a bookcase and\r\nthe window had remained closed during the whole night. He had _supplied\r\nhimself with oxygen, simply by his thought of oxygen_.\r\n\r\nWhen a student starts out to demonstrate, he should never turn back.\r\n“Let not that man who wavers think that he shall receive anything of\r\nthe Lord.”\r\n\r\nA colored student once made this wonderful statement, “When I asks\r\nthe Father for anything, I puts my foot down, and I says: Father,\r\nI’ll take nothing less than I’ve asked for, but more!” So man should\r\nnever compromise: “Having done all—Stand.” This is sometimes the most\r\ndifficult time of demonstrating. The temptation comes to give up, to\r\nturn back, to compromise.\r\n\r\n“He also serves who only stands and waits.”\r\n\r\nDemonstrations often come at the eleventh hour because man then lets\r\ngo, that is, stops reasoning, and Infinite Intelligence has a chance to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n“Man’s dreary desires are answered drearily, and his impatient desires,\r\nlong delayed or violently fulfilled.”\r\n\r\nFor example: A woman asked me why it was she was constantly losing or\r\nbreaking her glasses.\r\n\r\nWe found she often said to herself and others with vexation, “I wish\r\nI could get rid of my glasses.” So her impatient desire was violently\r\nfulfilled. What she should have demanded was perfect eye-sight, but\r\nwhat she registered in the subconscious was simply the impatient desire\r\nto be rid of her glasses; so they were continually being broken or lost.\r\n\r\nTwo attitudes of mind cause loss: depreciation, as in the case of the\r\nwoman who did not appreciate her husband, _or fear of loss_, which\r\nmakes a picture of loss in the subconscious.\r\n\r\nWhen a student is able to let go of his problem (cast his burden) he\r\nwill have instantaneous manifestation.\r\n\r\nFor example: A woman was out during a very stormy day and her umbrella\r\nwas blown inside-out. She was about to make a call on some people whom\r\nshe had never met and she did not wish to make her first appearance\r\nwith a dilapidated umbrella. She could not throw it away, as it did not\r\nbelong to her. So in desperation, she exclaimed: “Oh, God, you take\r\ncharge of this umbrella, I don’t know what to do.”\r\n\r\nA moment later, a voice behind her said: “Lady, do you want your\r\numbrella mended?” There stood an umbrella mender.\r\n\r\nShe replied, “Indeed, I do.”\r\n\r\nThe man mended the umbrella, while she went into the house to pay her\r\ncall, and when she returned, she had a good umbrella. So there is\r\nalways an umbrella mender at hand, on man’s pathway, when one puts the\r\numbrella (or situation) in God’s Hands.\r\n\r\nOne should always follow a denial with an affirmation.\r\n\r\nFor example: I was called on the ’phone late one night to treat a\r\nman whom I had never seen. He was apparently very ill. I made the\r\nstatement: “I deny this appearance of disease. It is unreal, therefore\r\ncannot register in his consciousness; this man is a perfect idea in\r\nDivine Mind, pure substance expressing perfection.”\r\n\r\nThere is no time or space, in Divine Mind, therefore the word reaches\r\ninstantly its destination and does not “return void.” I have treated\r\npatients in Europe and have found that the result was instantaneous.\r\n\r\nI am asked so often the difference between visualizing and visioning.\r\nVisualizing is a mental process governed by the reasoning or conscious\r\nmind; visioning is a spiritual process, governed by intuition, or the\r\nsuperconscious mind. The student should train his mind to receive\r\nthese flashes of inspiration, and work out the “divine pictures,”\r\nthrough definite leads. When a man can say, “I desire only that which\r\nGod desires for me,” his false desires fade from the consciousness,\r\nand a new set of blueprints is given him by the Master Architect, the\r\nGod within. God’s plan for each man transcends the limitation of the\r\nreasoning mind, and is always the square of life, containing health,\r\nwealth, love and perfect self-expression. Many a man is building for\r\nhimself in imagination a bungalow when he should be building a palace.\r\n\r\nIf a student tries to force a demonstration (through the reasoning\r\nmind) he brings it to a standstill. “I will hasten it,” saith the Lord.\r\nHe should act only through intuition, or definite leads. “Rest in the\r\nLord and wait patiently. Trust also in him, and he will bring it to\r\npass.”\r\n\r\nI have seen the law work in the most astonishing manner. For example: A\r\nstudent stated that it was necessary for her to have a hundred dollars\r\nby the following day. It was a debt of vital importance which had to be\r\nmet. I “spoke the word,” declaring Spirit was “never too late” and that\r\nthe supply was at hand.\r\n\r\nThat evening she phoned me of the miracle. She said that the thought\r\ncame to her to go to her safe-deposit box at the bank to examine some\r\npapers. She looked over the papers, and at the bottom of the box, was\r\na new one hundred dollar-bill. She was astounded, and said she knew\r\nshe had never put it there, for she had gone through the papers many\r\ntimes. It may have been a materialization, as Jesus Christ materialized\r\nthe loaves and fishes. Man will reach the stage where his “word is\r\nmade flesh,” or materialized, instantly. “The fields, ripe with the\r\nharvest,” will manifest immediately, as in all of the miracles of Jesus\r\nChrist.\r\n\r\nThere is a tremendous power alone in the name Jesus Christ. It stands\r\nfor _Truth Made Manifest_. He said, “Whatsoever ye ask the Father, in\r\nmy name, he will give it to you.”\r\n\r\nThe power of this name raises the student into the fourth dimension,\r\nwhere he is freed from all astral and psychic influences, and he\r\nbecomes “unconditioned and absolute, as God Himself is unconditioned\r\nand absolute.”\r\n\r\nI have seen many healings accomplished by using the words, “In the name\r\nof Jesus Christ.”\r\n\r\nChrist was both person and principle; and the Christ within each man is\r\nhis Redeemer and Salvation.\r\n\r\nThe Christ within, is his own fourth dimensional self, the man made\r\nin God’s image and likeness. This is the self which has never failed,\r\nnever known sickness or sorrow, was never born and has never died. It\r\nis the “resurrection and the life” of each man! “No man cometh to the\r\nFather save by the Son,” means, that God, the Universal, working on\r\nthe place of the particular, becomes the Christ in man; and the Holy\r\nGhost, means God-in-action. So daily, man is manifesting the Trinity of\r\nFather, Son and Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\nMan should make an art of thinking. The Master Thinker is an artist\r\nand is careful to paint only the divine designs upon the canvas of his\r\nmind; and he paints these pictures with masterly strokes of power and\r\ndecision, having perfect faith that there is no power to mar their\r\nperfection and that they shall manifest in his life the ideal made real.\r\n\r\nAll power is given man (through right thinking) to bring _his heaven_\r\nupon _his earth_, and this is the _goal of the_ “_Game of Life_.”\r\n\r\nThe simple rules are fearless faith, nonresistance and love!\r\n\r\nMay each reader be now freed from that thing which has held him in\r\nbondage through the ages, standing between him and his own, and “know\r\nthe Truth which makes him free”—free to fulfill his destiny, to bring\r\ninto manifestation the “_Divine Design of his life_, Health, Wealth,\r\nLove and Perfect Self-Expression.” “Be ye transformed by the renewing\r\nof your mind.”\r\n\r\n\r\n(For Prosperity)\r\n\r\nGod is my unfailing supply, and large sums of money come to me quickly,\r\nunder grace, in perfect ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n(For Right Conditions)\r\n\r\nEvery plan my Father in heaven has not planned, shall be dissolved and\r\ndissipated, and the Divine Idea now comes to pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n(For Right Conditions)\r\n\r\nOnly that which is true of God is true of me, for I and the Father are\r\nONE.\r\n\r\n\r\n(For Faith)\r\n\r\nAs I am one with God, I am one with my good, for God is both the\r\n_Giver_ and the _Gift_. I cannot separate the _Giver_ from the gift.\r\n\r\n\r\n(For Right Conditions)\r\n\r\nDivine Love now dissolves and dissipates every wrong condition in my\r\nmind, body and affairs. Divine Love is the most powerful chemical in\r\nthe universe, and _dissolves everything_ which is not of itself!\r\n\r\n\r\n(For Health)\r\n\r\nDivine Love floods my consciousness with health, and every cell in my\r\nbody is filled with light.\r\n\r\n\r\n(For the Eyesight)\r\n\r\nMy eyes are God’s eyes, I see with the eyes of spirit. I see clearly\r\nthe open way; there are no obstacles on my pathway. I see clearly the\r\nperfect plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n(For Guidance)\r\n\r\nI am divinely sensitive to my intuitive leads, and give instant\r\nobedience to Thy will.\r\n\r\n\r\n(For the Hearing)\r\n\r\nMy ears are God’s ears, I hear with the ears of spirit. I am\r\nnonresistant and am willing to be led. I hear glad tidings of great joy.\r\n\r\n\r\n(For Right Work)\r\n\r\n    _I have a perfect work\r\n      In a perfect way;\r\n    I give a perfect service\r\n      For perfect pay._\r\n\r\n\r\n(For Freedom from all Bondage)\r\n\r\n_I cast this burden on the Christ within, and I go free!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\n  “_One secret\r\n  of her success was that\r\n  she was always herself ... colloquial,\r\n  informal, friendly, and humorous.\r\n  She herself was very spiritual ...\r\n  and taught by familiar, practical, and\r\n  everyday examples._”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Decoration]\r\n\r\nEMMET FOX\r\n\r\n—_On Florence Scovel Shinn_—\r\n\r\n\r\nBooks by _FLORENCE SCOVEL SHINN_\r\n\r\n  THE GAME OF LIFE & HOW TO PLAY IT\r\n  THE POWER OF THE SPOKEN WORD\r\n  YOUR WORD IS YOUR WAND\r\n  THE SECRET DOOR TO SUCCESS\r\n  THE WRITINGS OF FLORENCE SCOVEL SHINN (_1 Vol. Edition_)\r\n  THE GAME OF LIFE—_Cassette Tape_\r\n\r\n\r\n  DEVORSS & COMPANY, _Publishers_\r\n  Marina del Rey, California 90294-0550\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n  pg 8 Changed: victim of distorted imagiation.\r\n            to: victim of distorted imagination.\r\n\r\n  pg 86 Changed: the Holy One of Isreal\r\n             to: the Holy One of Israel",
