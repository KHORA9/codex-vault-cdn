TULLI CICERONIS\r\n\r\nCATO MAIOR DE SENECTUTE\r\n\r\n_WITH INTRODUCTION AND NOTES_\r\n\r\nBY JAMES S. REID, M.L.\r\n\r\nAmerican Edition Revised\r\n\r\nBY FRANCIS W. KELSEY\r\n\r\nUNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN\r\n\r\n_Copyright, 1882_\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nThree years ago Mr. James S. Reid, of Gonville and Caius College,\r\nCambridge, prepared for the Syndics of the University Press editions of\r\nCicero's _Cato Maior de Senectute_ and _Laelius de Amicitia._ The thorough\r\nand accurate scholarship displayed, especially in the elucidation of the\r\nLatinity, immediately won for the books a cordial reception; and since then\r\nthey have gained a permanent place in the esteem of English scholars.\r\n\r\nThe present volume has the full authorization of Mr. Reid, and was prepared\r\nwith the design of presenting to American students, in a form best adapted\r\nto their use, the results of his work. The Text remains substantially that\r\nof Mr. Reid; while mention is made in the notes of the most important\r\nvariations in readings and orthography from other editions. The\r\nIntroductions have been recast, with some enlargement; the analyses of the\r\nsubject-matter in particular have been entirely remodelled. The Notes have\r\nbeen in some instances reduced, in others amplified,--especially by the\r\naddition of references to the standard treatises on grammar, history, and\r\nphilosophy. It was at first the intention of the American editor to\r\nindicate by some mark the matter due to himself; but as this could hardly\r\nbe done without marring the appearance of the page, and thus introducing a\r\nsource of confusion to the student, it was not attempted. In the work of\r\nrevision free use of the principal German and English editions has been\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nTo some the notes of the present edition may appear too copious. The aim\r\nthroughout, however, has been not simply to give aid on difficult points,\r\nbut to call attention to the finer usages of the Latin, and to add also\r\nwhatever explanation seemed necessary to a clear understanding of the\r\nsubject-matter. Latin scholarship which shall be at the same time broad and\r\naccurate, including not only a mastery of the language but also a\r\ncomprehensive view of the various phases of Roman life and thought, will,\r\nit is believed, be best assured by the slow and careful reading of some\r\nportions of the literature and by the rapid survey of others. Certainly of\r\nthe shorter Latin classics few would more fully repay close and careful\r\nstudy of both language and thought than these charming colloquies on Old\r\nAge and Friendship. While almost faultless in expression, they embody in a\r\nremarkable degree that universal element which characterizes the literary\r\nmasterpiece, and makes it the valued possession not merely of an age or a\r\nnation, but of all time.\r\n\r\nFRANCIS W.

STATE OF PHILOSOPHY IN CICERO'S TIME.\r\n\r\nIn Philosophy the Romans originated nothing. Their energies in the earlier\r\nyears of the state were wholly absorbed in organization and conquest.\r\nResting in a stern and simple creed, they had little speculative interest\r\nin matters outside the hard routine of their daily life. But with the close\r\nof the Period of Conquest came a change. The influx of wealth from\r\nconquered provinces, the formation of large landed estates, the excessive\r\nemployment of slave labor, and the consequent rise of a new aristocracy,\r\nprepared the way for a great revolution. The old religion lost its hold on\r\nthe higher classes; something was needed to take its place. With wealth and\r\nluxury came opportunity and desire for culture. Greece, with Art,\r\nLiterature, and Philosophy fully developed and highly perfected, stood\r\nready to instruct her rude conqueror.[1]\r\n\r\nIn Cicero's time the productive era of Greek Philosophy had well-nigh\r\npassed. Its tendency was less speculative, more ethical and practical than\r\nin the earlier time. There were four prominent schools, the New Academy,\r\nthe Peripatetic, the Stoic, and the Epicurean. The supporters of the\r\nlast-named advocated in Science the doctrine of the atom, in Ethics the\r\npursuit of pleasure, in Religion the complete inactivity of the gods.\r\n\r\nThe Stoics and Peripatetics were divided by comparatively unimportant\r\ndifferences. In Ethics, considered by them as almost the whole of\r\nPhilosophy, which was itself defined as 'the art of living', the main\r\nquestion between the two schools was the amount of importance to be\r\nattributed to Virtue,--the Stoics declaring that in comparison with Virtue\r\nall other things sink into absolute insignificance, while the Peripatetics\r\nmaintained that these have a certain though infinitesimally small\r\nsignificance. The New Academy taught at this time no complete philosophical\r\nsystem. It simply proclaimed the view that in the field of knowledge\r\ncertainty is unattainable, and that all the inquirer has to do is to\r\nbalance probabilities one against the other. The New Academic, therefore,\r\nwas free to accept any opinions which seemed to him to have the weight of\r\nprobability on their side, but he was bound to be ready to abandon them\r\nwhen anything appeared which altered his views of the probabilities. He not\r\nonly might be, but he could not help being, _eclectic_; that is, he chose\r\nsuch views promulgated by other schools as seemed to him at the moment to\r\nbe most reasonable or probable. Cicero called himself an adherent of this\r\nschool. On most points however, although eclectic, he agreed with the\r\nPeripatetics, but with a decided leaning toward the Stoic ethical system.\r\nThe Stoic opinion that it is the duty of the wise man to abstain from\r\npublic life, which the Peripatetics contested, Cicero decisively rejected.\r\nWith the Epicureans he had absolutely no sympathy. Up to this time these\r\nschools and their teachings were known to the Romans only through the\r\nmedium of the Greek. The only Latin philosophical literature was Epicurean,\r\nand, excepting the poem of Lucretius (_De Rerum Natura_), scarcely famous\r\nas yet, consisted entirely of books rudely written, although considerably\r\nread.\r\n\r\n(ii.) THE MISSION OF CICERO IN PHILOSOPHY.\r\n\r\nCicero made no claim to originality as a philosopher, nor even to complete\r\nacquaintance with every detail of the Greek systems.[2] In early life he\r\nhad studied with enthusiasm and success all the learning of the Greeks, but\r\nespecially in the two departments of Rhetoric and Philosophy, then closely\r\nconnected, or rather hardly distinguished. He not only sought the society\r\nof learned Greeks, but spent considerable time in study at Rhodes and\r\nAthens, which had become not merely the 'school of Greece', as Thucydides\r\nmakes Pericles call her, but the school of the civilized world.[3] When, by\r\nreason of political troubles, he was forced to retire to private life, he\r\nbegan to carry out a great plan for interpreting the best philosophical\r\nwritings of the Greeks to his fellow-countrymen. For this work his liberal\r\nviews as a New Academic peculiarly fitted him. His usual method was to take\r\none or two leading Greek works on the subject with which he was dealing,\r\nand to represent freely in his own language their subject-matter,\r\nintroducing episodes and illustrations of his own. He thus presented to the\r\nRomans in their own tongue the most significant portions of the Greek\r\nPhilosophy; and in his writings there has come down to us much, especially\r\nof the Post-Aristotelian Philosophy, that was doomed to oblivion in the\r\noriginal Greek. But further than this, to Cicero more than to any other\r\nRoman is due the formation of a Latin philosophical vocabulary, by which\r\nthe language was enriched and fitted for the part it has since taken as the\r\nLanguage of the Learned. While on many points Cicero's own views can hardly\r\nbe determined with perfect exactness, the exalted sentiments and the\r\nexquisite literary finish of his philosophical writings have always won\r\nadmiration; and through them he has exerted no small influence on the\r\nliterature and life of modern times.[4]\r\n\r\n(iii.) THE PHILOSOPHICAL WRITINGS OF CICERO.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of an exceptionally busy public life Cicero devoted his\r\nspare moments to reading and to the society of the learned. After his exile\r\nin 58 and 57 B.C. his political career, except for a brief period just\r\nbefore his death, was over, and it is at this time that his period of great\r\nliterary activity begins, In 55 he produced the work _De Oratore_, in 54\r\nthe _De Re Publica_, and in 52 the _De Legibus_, all three works, according\r\nto ancient ideas, entitled to rank as philosophical.[5]\r\n\r\nFrom 51 to 46 B.C., owing first to his absence in Cilicia, then to the\r\ncivil troubles, Cicero almost ceased to write. But in the latter year he\r\nwas reconciled with Caesar, and as the Senate and law courts were closed\r\nagainst him on his refusal to compromise his political principles, he\r\nbetook himself with greater devotion than ever to literature. The first\r\nwork written in 46 was the _Hortensius_, or _De Philosophia_, now lost. It\r\nwas founded on a lost dialogue of Aristotle, and set forth the advantages\r\nof studying Philosophy. During the same year Cicero completed several\r\noratorical works, the _Partitiones Oratoriae_, the _Brutus_, or _De Claris\r\nOratoribus_, and the _Orator_, all of which are extant.\r\n\r\nEarly in 45 Cicero lost his beloved daughter Tullia. He passed the whole\r\nyear in retirement, trying to soothe his grief by incessant writing. In\r\nquick succession appeared\r\n\r\n_De Consolatione_, an attempt to apply philosophy to the mitigation of his\r\nown sorrow and that of others;\r\n\r\n_Academica_, an exposition of the New Academic Philosophy, advocating\r\nprobability rather than certainty as the foundation of philosophy;\r\n\r\n_De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum_, a work criticising the most prominent\r\nviews entertained concerning Ethics;\r\n\r\n_Disputationes Tusculanae_, treating of certain conditions essential to\r\nmorality and happiness;\r\n\r\n_De Natura Deorum_, an examination of the principal theories regarding the\r\nnature and power of the gods;\r\n\r\n_Cato Maior_, on old age; _Laelius_, on friendship;\r\n\r\n_De Fato_, discussing Fate and Free Will;\r\n\r\n_Paradoxa_, a book setting forth certain remarkable views of the Stoics;\r\n\r\n_De Officiis_, a treatise on practical ethics, the application of moral\r\nprinciples to the questions and difficulties of ordinary life.\r\n\r\nThese works, written mostly in 45 and 44, are, except the _De Cons.,_ still\r\nextant. To the list may be added also other works of a rhetorical nature,\r\nsuch as the _Topica_ and _De Optima Genere Dicendi_, and some lost\r\nphilosophical books, such as _De Gloria_.\r\n\r\nEven though allowance be made for the fact that Cicero was giving in Latin\r\nthe substance of Greek books with which he had been familiar from boyhood,\r\nthe mental vigor and literary power exhibited by this series of works\r\nappear prodigious when we consider their great compass and variety and the\r\ngenerally high finish of their style.\r\n\r\n_References._--For a fuller account of Cicero's philosophical views and\r\nwritings consult Ritter, 'History of Ancient Philosophy', Vol. 4, Ch. 2;\r\nMaurice, 'Moral and Metaphysical Philosophy', Ch. 7, § 5; Tennemann and\r\nMorell, 'History of Philosophy', Ch. 3; Ueberweg, 'History of Philosophy',\r\nVol I, § 61; J.B.

ORIGIN AND SCOPE.\r\n\r\n1. _Date and Circumstances of Composition._\r\n\r\nThe date at which the Cato Maior was written can be determined with almost\r\nperfect exactness. A mention in Cicero's work entitled _De Divinatione_[6]\r\nshows that the Cato Maior preceded that work by a short time. The _De\r\nDivinatione_ was written after the assassination of Caesar, that is, after\r\nthe 15th of March in the year 44.[7] Again, the Cato Maior is mentioned as\r\na recent work in three letters addressed by Cicero to Atticus.[8] The\r\nearliest of these letters was written on or about the 12th of May, 44.[9]\r\nWe shall hardly err, therefore, if we assume that Cicero composed the Cato\r\nMaior in April of the year 44.[10] This agrees also with slight indications\r\nin the work itself. In the dedicatory introduction Cicero speaks of\r\ntroubles weighing heavily on himself and Atticus.[11] Any one who reads the\r\nletters to Atticus despatched in April, 44, will have little doubt that the\r\ntroubles hinted at are the apprehensions as to the course of Antonius, from\r\nwhom Cicero had personally something to fear. Atticus was using all the\r\ninfluence he could bring to bear on Antonius in order to secure Cicero's\r\nsafety; hence Cicero's care to avoid in the dedication all but the vaguest\r\npossible allusions to politics. Had that introduction been written before\r\nCaesar's death, we should have had plain allusions (as in the prooemia of\r\nthe _Academica_, the _De Finibus_, the _Tusculan Disputations_, and the _De\r\nNatura Deorum_) to Caesar's dictatorship.[12]\r\n\r\nThe time was one of desperate gloom for Cicero. The downfall of the old\r\nconstitution had overwhelmed him with sorrow, and his brief outburst of joy\r\nover Caesar's death had been quickly succeeded by disgust and alarm at the\r\nproceedings of Antonius. The deep wound caused by his daughter's death[13]\r\nwas still unhealed. It is easy to catch in the Cato Maior some echoes of\r\nhis grief for her. When it is said that of all Cato's titles to admiration\r\nnone is higher than the fortitude he showed in bearing the death of his\r\nson,[14] the writer is thinking of the struggle he himself had been waging\r\nagainst a like sorrow for more than a year past; and when Cato expresses\r\nhis firm conviction that he will meet his child beyond the grave,[15] we\r\ncan see Cicero's own yearning for reunion with his deeply loved Tullia.\r\n\r\n2. _Greek Sources._\r\n\r\nAll Cicero's philosophical and rhetorical writings were confessedly founded\r\nmore or less on Greek originals.[16] The stores from which he principally\r\ndrew in writing the Cato Maior are clearly indicated in several parts of\r\nthe work. Passages from Xenophon's _Oeconomicus_ are translated in Chapters\r\n17 and 22. In Chapters 2 and 3 there is a close imitation of the\r\nconversation between Socrates and Cephalus at the beginning of Plato's\r\n_Republic_, while in Chapter 21 is reproduced one of the most striking\r\nportions of the _Phaedo_, 72 E-73 B, 78-80.[17] The view of the divine\r\norigin and destiny of the human soul contained in the passage from the\r\n_Phaedo_ is rendered by Cicero in many of his works,[18] and was held by\r\nhim with quite a religious fervor and sincerity.\r\n\r\nBesides these instances of special indebtedness Cicero, in composing the\r\nCato Maior, was no doubt under obligations of a more general kind to the\r\nGreeks. The form of the dialogue is Greek, and Aristotelian rather than\r\nPlatonic.[19] But further, it is highly probable that Cicero owed to some\r\nparticular Greek dialogue on Old Age the general outline of the arguments\r\nhe there brings forward. Many of the Greek illustrative allusions may have\r\nhad the same origin, though in many cases Roman illustrations must have\r\nbeen substituted for Greek. Whether the dialogue by Aristo Cius, cursorily\r\nmentioned in the Cato Maior,[20] was at all used by Cicero or not it is\r\nimpossible to determine.[21]\r\n\r\n3. _Purpose._\r\n\r\nThe Cato Maior is a popular essay in Ethics, applying the principles of\r\nphilosophy to the alleviation of one of life's chief burdens, old age. In\r\nancient times, when philosophy formed the real and only religion of the\r\neducated class, themes like this were deemed to afford a worthy employment\r\nfor the pens even of the greatest philosophers. Such essays formed the only\r\nsubstitute the ancients had for our Sermons. There can be no doubt of\r\nCicero's sincerity when he says that the arguments he sets forth in the\r\ntreatise had given him real comfort,[22] and the opening words of the\r\ndedication show that he meant and hoped to administer the same comfort to\r\nhis friend Atticus, who indeed acknowledged the benefit he derived from the\r\nwork.[23] When Cicero wrote the treatise he was himself sixty-two years of\r\nage, while his friend was three years older. He speaks, therefore, rather\r\neuphemistically when he says that his purpose is to lighten the trouble of\r\nan old age which is already close at hand, or at all events\r\napproaching.[24]\r\n\r\nBut in addition to the main ethical purpose, there was, as in many of\r\nCicero's works, a distinct political purpose. He desired to stimulate in\r\nhis readers an admiration for what he regarded as the golden age of Roman\r\npolitics, the era of the Punic wars, and to do this by making the contrast\r\nbetween that age and his own appear as striking as possible. A like double\r\npurpose is apparent throughout the _De Re Publica_, where Africanus the\r\nyounger is the chief personage, and in the treatise on Friendship, where\r\nLaelius is the central figure. For the dialogue on Old Age M. Porcius Cato\r\nthe Censor is selected as the principal speaker for two reasons: first,\r\nbecause he was renowned for the vigor of mind and body he displayed in\r\nadvanced life;[25] and secondly, because in him were conspicuously\r\nexhibited the serious simplicity, the unswerving adherence to principle,\r\nand the self-sacrificing patriotism which were the ideal Roman virtues, and\r\nwhich Cicero could not find among the politicians of his time.\r\n\r\n4. _Form and Language._\r\n\r\nThe Cato Maior, like most of Cicero's philosophical writings, is cast in\r\nthe form of a dialogue. Among the ancients the dialogue was a common\r\nrhetorical device, especially in the presentation of abstruse subjects. The\r\nintroduction of characters to conduct the discussion gave vividness and\r\nclearness to the unfolding of the argument, as well as a kind of dramatic\r\ninterest to the production. In the Cato Maior[26] and the Laelius, as\r\ngenerally, Cicero followed the plan of Aristotle's dialogues (now lost)\r\nrather than that of the dialogues of Plato. In the former there was more of\r\nexposition and less of discussion than in the latter; one person stated his\r\nviews on some question, and the company in attendance only made occasional\r\nremarks without attempting to debate the question. In the latter, although\r\none person, Socrates, is everywhere prominent, others are continually drawn\r\ninto the discussions, and there is a quick interchange of question and\r\nanswer. The Aristotelian form was better adapted to Cicero's purposes than\r\nthe Platonic; the progress of the argument was less interrupted, and thus\r\nbetter opportunity for a symmetrical development of the theme was afforded.\r\nThen, too, the former was more popular. The style of Aristotle[27] had been\r\nimitated by Theophrastus and many other writers down to Cicero's time,\r\nwhile that of Plato had found hardly any imitators.\r\n\r\nThe editors of the Cato Maior have generally assumed that Cicero attempted\r\nto give an antique coloring to the diction of the dialogue in order to\r\nremind readers of Cato's own style. It is only necessary to read a page or\r\ntwo of Cato's _De Re Rustica_ to have this illusion dispelled. The only\r\nthings actually alleged to be archaisms are (1) the use of deponent\r\nparticiples as passives in §§ 4, 59, 74, a thing common enough in Cicero;\r\n(2) the occurrence of _quasi_ = _quem ad modum_ in § 71; (3) of _audaciter_\r\n= _audacter_ in § 72; (4) of _tuerentur_ for _intuerentur_ in § 77; (5) of\r\n_neutiquam_ in § 42; (6) of the nominative of the gerundive governing an\r\naccusative case in § 6. In every instance the notes will supply a\r\nrefutation of the allegation. That Cicero should attempt to write in any\r\nstyle but his own is exceedingly improbable.\r\n\r\n5. _Personages._\r\n\r\nThe conversation is supposed to take place between Cato, Scipio Africanus\r\nthe younger, and Laelius, in the year before Cato's death, _i.e._ 150 B.C.,\r\nwhen he was in his eighty-fourth year,[28] Scipio being about 35 and\r\nLaelius a few years older.\r\n\r\n(1.) _Cato._ M. Porcius Cato was born in 234 B.C.[29] at the ancient Latin\r\ntown of Tusculum. Little is known of his family except that it was\r\nplebeian, and possessed a small patrimony in the territory of the Sabines,\r\nclose to the farm of M'. Curius Dentatus, one of Cato's great heroes and\r\nmodels. The heads of the family, so far as memory extended, had\r\ndistinguished themselves as tough warriors and hardy farmers. Among the\r\nSabines, who even down to the times of the Empire were famed for simplicity\r\nof manners and the practice of all the sterner virtues, Cato passed those\r\nportions of his life which were not occupied with business of state. From\r\nhis earliest days he toiled in his own fields, and contented himself with\r\nthe hardest rustic life.[30] Yet even in his boyhood Cato must have passed\r\nintervals at Rome, and seen something of the great statesmen and generals\r\nof the time.[31] He seems to have received when young as thorough an\r\neducation as was possible without learning Greek, such an education as was\r\nto be obtained only in the capital. He grew up to manhood in the\r\ncomparatively quiet period between the first and the second Punic wars; the\r\nmost exciting event of his younger years must have been the destruction at\r\nClastidium of the vast hordes of Celts who had swept over the northern half\r\nof Italy, almost within reach of Rome.\r\n\r\nCato was of the age for military service about the time of the battle of\r\nLake Trasimenus, and entered the army then as a common soldier.[32] The\r\nfirst expedition in which he is definitely said to have taken part is that\r\nof Q. Fabius Maximus Cunctator against Hannibal in Campania, in 214.[33]\r\nThis Roman commander was a man entirely after Cato's heart, and became one\r\nof his models in public life.\r\n\r\nBefore and during the early years of his soldier's life, Cato succeeded in\r\nwinning some reputation as an orator, having practised first in the\r\nprovincial courts near his home, and afterwards at Rome.[34] This\r\nreputation as well as his great force of character procured for him a\r\npowerful life-long friend and patron, M. Valerius Flaccus, a statesman of\r\nthe old Roman conservative-democratic school of politics, the leader of\r\nwhich was Fabius Cunctator. Through the influence of Flaccus, possibly with\r\nthe aid of Fabius, Cato became military tribune, and served with that rank\r\nunder Marcellus in Sicily, under Fabius again at the capture of Tarentum in\r\n209,[35] and under C. Claudius Nero at the battle of the Metaurus, where he\r\ncontributed materially to that great victory.\r\n\r\nIn 204 Cato began his political career with the quaestorship.[36] As he was\r\na _novus homo_ and a man of small private means, it was no small\r\ndistinction that he had forced his way to office in his thirtieth year. The\r\nlot assigned him as quaestor to Scipio, then in Sicily and about to cross\r\nover into Africa. The chance was most unfortunate, if for no other reason,\r\nbecause Cato was intimately connected with the party in the senate opposed\r\nto Scipio, which had been attempting to bring him to trial for the\r\natrocities committed by the Roman army in southern Italy. But in addition\r\nthe two men were so utterly different that there was no possibility of the\r\nquaestor standing in that filial relation to his consul, which old Roman\r\ncustom required. As financial officer, Cato complained of the luxury and\r\nextravagance which Scipio allowed not only to himself but to his army. Yet\r\nthe complaint was made not so much on economic as on moral grounds; it\r\nseemed to Cato that the old Roman discipline and power to endure hardships\r\nwere being swept away. The dispute was ended by Scipio allowing Cato to\r\nreturn to Rome, some authorities say from Sicily, others from Africa.\r\nAccording to one writer,[37] he came home by way of Sardinia and brought\r\nthence with him Ennius the poet.[38]\r\n\r\nIn 199 Cato was plebeian aedile, and exercised with severity the police\r\njurisdiction pertaining to that office, yet so as to win popular approval,\r\nsince he was chosen praetor for 198 without the usual interval. The\r\nprovince of Sardinia was entrusted to him, and he strained every nerve to\r\nmake his government present as strong a contrast as possible with the lax\r\nand corrupt administration of the nobles who took Scipio for their pattern.\r\nThe troops were sternly disciplined, and law-breakers of every kind\r\nseverely dealt with; in money matters the strictest economy prevailed; all\r\ngifts from provincials to Roman officers were forbidden. The praetor, the\r\ngreat representative of Roman power, passed from town to town attended by a\r\nsingle servant.\r\n\r\nIn 196 Cato was occupied with his canvass for the consulship of the year\r\n195, to which he was elected in company with his friend Flaccus. Cato was\r\nthe first _novus homo_ elected since C. Flaminius, the consul of 217. It is\r\nprobable, though not certain, that he paved the way to his election by\r\ncarrying the first of the _leges Porciae_, restricting the right of\r\npunishing Roman citizens. During the whole of his career Cato showed a high\r\nsense of the importance of the individual _civis Romanus_.\r\n\r\nOne of the first official acts of the new consul was to deliver a set\r\nspeech to the people against a proposal to repeal the Oppian law, passed\r\ntwenty years before, the object of which was to prevent lavish expenditure\r\non dress and adornments, particularly by women. We have a lively report of\r\nCato's speech from Livy's pen, partly founded on the speech as published by\r\nCato himself.[39] The earnest pleading in favor of simple manners and\r\neconomy failed, after having almost caused an open insurrection on the part\r\nof the women.[40]\r\n\r\nThe two new provinces in Spain, Hispania Citerior and Ulterior, were still\r\nin a very unsettled state. The nearer province was made a consular province\r\nand assigned to Cato; the praetor who governed the farther province was\r\nalso placed under Cato's jurisdiction. Before leaving Rome Cato carried a\r\nlaw for protecting the provincials from extortion. During the whole of his\r\nyear of office he practised with the utmost exactness his principles of\r\npurity, simplicity, and economy in public affairs. He is said to have\r\nstarted from his house on the journey to Spain with only three servants,\r\nbut when he got as far as the forum, it struck him that such an attendance\r\nwas scarcely worthy of a Roman consul; so he purchased two more slaves on\r\nthe spot! In the same spirit, before returning he sold his horse that the\r\nstate might not be at the expense of transporting it to Italy. Cato was no\r\nless careful of the revenue than of the expenditure. He largely increased\r\nthe productiveness of the mines and other property belonging to the state,\r\nand all goods captured from the enemy were sold for the benefit of the\r\nexchequer. On leaving the province Cato made an unusually large gift to\r\neach soldier, saying that it was better for all to bring home silver than\r\nfor a few to bring home gold. The provincials were thoroughly content with\r\ntheir ruler and ever after looked on him as their best friend. The army was\r\nkept in the strictest discipline. Some disorderly conduct of the _equites_\r\nwas rebuked by Cato in a bitter harangue which he afterwards published.\r\nPartly by craft, partly by good leadership in the field, Cato broke the\r\nstrength of the turbulent natives and returned to enjoy a well-earned\r\ntriumph.[41] In the same year (194) a brilliant triumph was celebrated by\r\nFlamininus.\r\n\r\nScipio, probably uneasy at the great reputations quickly won by Flamininus\r\nand Cato, secured his second consulship for the year 194, but failed to\r\nachieve anything remarkable. Cato probably spent the three years after his\r\nreturn for the most part at his Sabine farm. When the war against Antiochus\r\nbroke out, he took service along with his friend Flaccus on the staff of\r\nthe consul Glabrio,[42] and by a difficult march over the mountains broke\r\nin on the king's rear, and so was chiefly instrumental in winning the great\r\nbattle of Thermopylae, by which Antiochus was driven out of Greece.\r\nImmediately after the battle Cato returned home with despatches. We have\r\ndim and uncertain information that he took the field once or twice again,\r\nbut his career as a soldier was practically ended.\r\n\r\nFrom this time to his death, forty years later, Cato was the leading figure\r\non the stage of Roman politics. In season and out of season he attacked\r\nabuses or innovations in speeches addressed to the senate, the people, or\r\nthe courts. Soon after his return from Thessaly he struck a heavy blow at\r\nthe unrepublican honor-hunting among the magistrates, of which the example\r\nhad been set by P. Scipio Africanus. Most provincial governors drove their\r\nsubjects into war, sent lying despatches home about their victories, and\r\nclaimed a triumph. In 190 Cato attacked with success the proposal to grant\r\na triumph to Q. Minucius Thermus, who had already triumphed over the\r\nSpaniards as praetor, and after his consulship in 193 had fought against\r\nthe Ligurians. Cato's next victim was his former commander M'. Acilius\r\nGlabrio, who came forward at the same time with Cato, Marcellus (a son of\r\nthe captor of Syracuse), L. Cornelius Scipio Nasica, T. Quinctius\r\nFlamininus (the conqueror of Macedonia) and Cato's friend L. Valerius\r\nFlaccus, as candidate for the censorship of 189. Cato by his violent\r\nspeeches procured the trial of Glabrio for appropriating the plunder\r\ncaptured in Thessaly, and himself gave evidence concerning some property\r\nwhich had disappeared. Glabrio denounced Cato as a perjurer, but yet\r\nretired from his candidature. On this occasion Cato and Flaccus failed,\r\nMarcellus being elected as plebeian and Flamininus as patrician censor.\r\n\r\nIn the next year (188) Cato acted in the senate with the party which tried\r\nunsuccessfully to refuse the triumph to the two consuls of 189, M. Fulvius\r\nNobilior and Cn. Manlius Vulso, the former of whom had gained none but\r\ntrifling advantages over the Aetolians, while the latter had disgraced the\r\nRoman name by making war without authorization upon the Gauls of Asia\r\nMinor, and had also suffered a humiliating defeat from some Thracian robber\r\nbands on his homeward march. Not disheartened by ill success, Cato and his\r\nfriends determined to strike at higher game. L. Scipio Asiaticus (or\r\nAsiagenus), the brother of Africanus, was asserted in the senate to have\r\nappropriated 3000 talents of public money when in command against\r\nAntiochus. Legal proceedings were taken not only against Asiaticus, but\r\nagainst Africanus, who behaved with great violence and arrogance. In the\r\nend Africanus withdrew to his country estate, while his brother was\r\ncondemned to pay a heavy fine. A death-stroke had been given to the almost\r\nkingly authority of Africanus, who never again showed his face in Rome. The\r\nproceedings against the Scipios seem to have begun in 187 and not to have\r\nbeen completed before 185.\r\n\r\nNearly twenty years had passed since the conflict between Cato and Scipio\r\nbegan, and now it had ended in a complete triumph for Cato.[43] But the new\r\nmodes of which Scipio was the chief patron were too strong to be conquered,\r\nand Cato spent the rest of his life in fighting a hopeless battle against\r\nthem, though he fought for a time with the strongest weapons that the\r\nconstitution supplied. In 184 he was censor along with Flaccus, who seems\r\nto have allowed his colleague full liberty of action. Every portion of the\r\ncensor's duty was carried out on the most severe and 'old Roman'\r\nprinciples. Seven senators were degraded, among them L. Flamininus, an\r\nex-consul and brother of the 'liberator of the Hellenes,' for serious\r\nmisconduct,[44] also Manilius, an ex-praetor, for no worse offence than\r\nthat of having kissed his wife in presence of his daughter. M. Furius\r\nPurpurio, who had actually competed with Cato for the censorship, was\r\npunished for diverting a public aqueduct for his private advantage. Flaccus\r\nwas named leader of the senate in the place of Scipio Africanus, now dead.\r\n\r\nOn reviewing the _equites_, Cato removed from that body L. Scipio and many\r\nothers on various charges: this one had allowed himself to grow too fat for\r\nhorsemanship; that had failed to groom his horse properly; another had\r\nneglected his farm; another again had made an untimely jest on the occasion\r\nof the review itself. With the ordinary citizens Cato dealt just as\r\nharshly. In his censorian edict he sharply reproved the extravagance\r\nprevalent at private feasts. All articles of luxury, such as slaves\r\npurchased at fancy prices, luxurious clothing, carriages, statues, and\r\npictures were rendered liable to heavy taxation. In this way Cato revenged\r\nhimself for the repeal of the Oppian law.\r\n\r\nIn looking after the property and income of the state Cato followed the\r\nsame principles he had acted on in Spain. He reduced the expenditure on\r\npublic works as far as possible, and took care to sell at the full price\r\nthe right to collect the revenue. Encroachments on the property of the\r\nnation were severely punished.\r\n\r\nNot by acts only, but by constant speeches, full at once of grimness and\r\nhumor, did Cato struggle against the degeneracy of his time[45]. He\r\nconcluded his period of office with a self-laudatory harangue, and assumed\r\nthe title _Censorius_, while his statue was placed in the temple of the\r\ngoddess Salus with an inscription affirming that he had reformed the Roman\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nBut in a very brief time all trace of Cato's activity as censor was swept\r\naway, except that afforded by the numerous life-long quarrels in which he\r\nhad involved himself[46]. In less than two years one of his victims,\r\nPurpurio, was employed by the senate on a high political mission, while\r\nanother, L. Flamininus, sat among the senators at the games in defiance of\r\nCato's sentence. Yet Cato remained by far the most powerful member of the\r\nsenate. Titus Flamininus, his only important rival, quickly passed out of\r\nnotice. So far as there was any democratic opposition to the senatorial\r\noligarchy, Cato was the leader of that opposition for the remainder of his\r\nlife. But at that period no great political movements agitated the state\r\nwithin; nearly the whole interest of the time was centred in the foreign\r\nrelations of Rome. On matters of foreign policy Cato offered but little\r\nopposition to the prevailing tendencies of the age, though on particular\r\noccasions he exercised great influence. But his voice was at all times\r\nloudly heard on all questions of morality and public order. He supported\r\nthe _lex Furia_ and the _lex Voconia_, the object of which was to prevent\r\nthe dissipation of family property, and the _lex Orchia_, directed against\r\nextravagant expenditure on feasts, also the _lex Baebia de ambitu_, the\r\nfirst serious attempt to check bribery. We hear also that Cato bitterly\r\nattacked Lepidus, censor in 180, for erecting a permanent theatre in place\r\nof the movable booths before used. The building was actually pulled down.\r\nWe are told that from time to time he denounced the misdoings of provincial\r\ngovernors. In 171 he was one of a commission of five for bringing to\r\njustice three ex-praetors who had practised all manner of corruption in\r\nSpain. Almost the last act of his life was to prosecute Galba for cruel\r\nmisgovernment of the Lusitanians. The titles of Cato's speeches show that\r\nhe played a great part in the deliberations of the senate concerning\r\nforeign affairs, but as his fighting days were over and he was unfitted for\r\ndiplomacy, we have little explicit evidence of his activity in this\r\ndirection. At the end of the third Macedonian war he successfully opposed\r\nthe annexation of Macedonia. He also saved from destruction the Rhodians,\r\nwho during the war had plainly desired the victory of Perseus, and in the\r\nearly days, when the Roman commanders had ill success, had deeply wounded\r\nthe whole Roman nation by an offer to mediate between them and the king of\r\nMacedon.\r\n\r\nCato had all his life retained his feeling of enmity to the Carthaginians,\r\nwhom Scipio, he thought, had treated too tenderly. In 150 he was one of an\r\nembassy sent to Carthage, and came back filled with alarm at the prosperity\r\nof the city. It is said that whatever was the subject on which he was asked\r\nfor his opinion in the senate, he always ended his speech with '_ceterum\r\ncenseo delendam esse Carthaginem_' P. Scipio Nasica, the son-in-law of\r\nAfricanus, and the representative of his policy, always shouted out the\r\nopposite opinion, thinking that the fear of Carthage had a salutary effect\r\non the Roman populace at large. But the ideas of Cato prevailed, and a\r\ncruel policy, carried out with needless brutality, led to the extinction of\r\nRome's greatest rival. Cato did not live to see the conclusion of the war;\r\nhe died in 149, at the age of 84 or 85 years, having retained his mental\r\nand physical vigor to the last. He had two sons, one by his first wife, and\r\none by his second wife, born when Cato was 80 years of age. The elder son,\r\nto whom many of Cato's works were addressed, died as praetor-elect, before\r\nhis father[47]. The other was grandfather of Cato Uticensis.\r\n\r\nThe literary activity of the old censor was great, though his leisure was\r\nsmall.[48] In Cicero's time a collection of 150 speeches was still extant.\r\nThe titles of about 90 are still known to us, and of some we possess a few\r\nfragments. Cato's greatest work, however, was his _Origines_, the first\r\nreal historical work written in Latin. His predecessors had been merely\r\ncompilers of chronicles. The work was founded on laborious investigations,\r\nand comprised the history of Rome from the earliest times perhaps down to\r\n150 B.C.[49], as well as notices of the history of other important Italian\r\nstates. Further, Cato wrote of Agriculture, to which he was\r\nenthusiastically devoted. We still have his _De Re Rustica_, a collection\r\nof maxims loosely strung together. He also composed works on law; a sort of\r\neducational encyclopaedia for his son; and a collection of witty sayings,\r\nΑποφθεγματα, drawn from Greek as well as from Roman sources.\r\n\r\nPlutarch seems to have known a collected edition of the pungent and\r\nproverbial utterances for which the censor was famous, and for which (not\r\nfor any knowledge of philosophy[50]) he received the title of _sapiens_\r\n('shrewd') which he bore at the end of his life. This edition, however, was\r\nnot compiled by Cato himself.\r\n\r\nIn view of Cicero's treatise, the Cato Maior, it is necessary to say\r\nsomething of Cato's relations with the Greeks and Greek literature. The\r\nancients give us merely vague statements that he only began to learn Greek\r\n'in his old age.' The expression must be liberally interpreted if, as seems\r\nclear, the whole of his writings showed the influence of Greek literature.\r\nIt is certain, however, that he thoroughly detested the Greek nation. This\r\nhatred was shown in acts more than once. No doubt Cato was at least a\r\nconsenting party to the expulsion from Rome of Greek teachers in 161 B.C.\r\nWhen in 155 the famous embassy came from Athens consisting of Carneades the\r\nAcademic, Critolaus the Peripatetic and Diogenes the Stoic, Cato was a\r\nprime mover of the decree by which they were removed from the city.\r\nSocrates was one of Cato's favorite marks for jests. And this is the man\r\ninto whose mouth Cicero puts the utterances, but slightly veiled, of Greek\r\nwisdom!\r\n\r\n(2.) _Scipio_. P. Cornelius Scipio Africanus, the younger, was no blood\r\nrelation of the conqueror of Hannibal, but the adopted son of his son. It\r\nmust be remembered, however, that adoption was much more formal and\r\nbinding, and produced much closer ties in ancient than in modern times.[51]\r\nThe elder Africanus was unfortunate in his sons. The younger of these\r\nattained to the praetorship in 174, but was immediately driven from the\r\nsenate by the censors of that year on account of his disreputable life. The\r\nelder was an invalid, who never held any office except that of augur, and\r\ndied at an early age. He adopted the son of L. Aemilius Paulus, the victor\r\nof Pydna; the adopted son bore the name Aemilianus in memory of his origin.\r\nCato's son married a daughter of Paulus, so that the censor was brought\r\ninto relationship with the Cornelii, whose most illustrious representative\r\nhe had hated and attacked.\r\n\r\nThe young Scipio was born about 185, and when scarce 17 years old fought\r\nwith daring bravery at Pydna. While still very young he showed a great\r\ndevotion to study, which he retained through life. He was a thorough\r\npartisan of the new Greek learning, and grouped around him in friendship\r\nall the leaders of the Hellenistic movement. Among his dearest friends were\r\nPolybius, the Greek statesman and historian, and later Panaetius, the\r\nStoic. In 151 B.C. when the consuls found it difficult to enlist officers\r\nand men for service in Spain, where great defeats had been suffered, Scipio\r\nvolunteered, and served with great distinction as military tribune. When\r\nthe war with Carthage broke out he held the same rank, and shone by\r\ncomparison with his blundering superior officers. Coming to Rome in 148 he\r\nstood for the aedileship, but was elected consul for the year 147, and\r\nagain for 146, when he finished the war. He is said to have grieved over\r\nthe fate of Carthage, and to have dreaded any further increase of the Roman\r\nterritory. In 142 Scipio was censor, and acted with almost Catonian\r\nseverity. In 134, though not a candidate, he was elected to the consulship\r\nand put in command of the Roman army then besieging the city of Numantia in\r\nSpain. The war, of which this siege formed a part, had been going on for\r\nsome years most disastrously for the Romans, but Scipio speedily brought it\r\nto a conclusion in 133. While before Numantia he received news of the\r\nmurder of Ti. Gracchus, whose sister he had married and whose cousin he had\r\nbecome by adoption, but whose policy he had on the whole opposed, though he\r\nhad occasionally coquetted with the democrats. This course cost him the\r\nfavor of the people, and when in 131 he desired to conduct the war against\r\nAristonicus, only two of the thirty-five tribes voted for his appointment.\r\nIn 129, after a violent scene in the senate, where he had opposed the\r\ncarrying out of Ti. Gracchus' agrarian law, he was triumphantly escorted\r\nhome by a crowd, composed chiefly of Italians whose interests had been\r\nthreatened by the law. Next morning he was found dead in his bed. Opinion\r\nas to the cause of his death was divided at the time and so remained. In\r\nthe _Laelius_ the death is assumed to have been from natural causes.[52]\r\nElsewhere, however, Cicero adopts the view of many of Scipio's friends that\r\nhe was murdered by Carbo.[53] Carbo afterwards lent color to the suspicions\r\nby putting himself to death, in order, as was supposed, to avoid a direct\r\nprosecution. In ancient times even C. Gracchus was suspected of having thus\r\navenged his brother's death, but no modern scholar of any rank has\r\ncountenanced the suspicion.\r\n\r\nWhether the degree of intimacy between Cato and Scipio, which Cicero\r\nassumes, ever existed or not, cannot be determined.[54] There was much in\r\nScipio that would attract Cato. Unlike the elder Africanus, he was severe\r\nand simple in his outward life, and though a lover of Greek and Greeks, yet\r\nattached to all that was best in the old Roman character and polity. Though\r\nan opponent of revolution, he was far from being a partisan of the\r\noligarchy. Altogether, of all Romans, he most nearly deserved the\r\ndescription, 'ανηρ τετραγωνος ανευ ψογου,' 'a man four-square without\r\nreproach.' In his _De Re Publica_, Cicero points to Scipio as the ideal\r\nstatesman, and often elsewhere eulogizes him as an almost perfect Roman.\r\n\r\n(3.) _Laelius_. Gaius Laelius, born about 186, was Scipio's most\r\ndistinguished officer before Carthage, and his most intimate friend\r\nthroughout life. The friendship of the two was one of the most famous in\r\nantiquity, and is celebrated in the _Laelius_. Laelius was an able speaker,\r\nwriter and soldier, and devoted to Greek learning, particularly to the\r\nStoic philosophy. He is with Cicero the type of a man of culture.[55] He,\r\ntoo, is one of the interlocutors in the _De Re Publica_.\r\n\r\n(ii.) SUBJECT-MATTER.\r\n\r\n1. _General View_.\r\n\r\nThe Cato Maior falls naturally into three parts:--\r\n\r\n  Preliminary, dedication to Atticus, §§ 1-3;\r\n  Introductory Conversation, 4-9;\r\n  Cato's Defence of Old Age, 10-85.\r\n\r\nAfter § 9 Cato continues to express his views on old age without\r\ninterruption to the end, and the dialogue thus becomes really a monologue.\r\n\r\n2. _Analysis._\r\n\r\n  PRELIMINARY  1-3.\r\n\r\nCicero, addressing Atticus, states his purpose in writing the book and the\r\neffect of the work on himself (1, 2), the reasons for putting the\r\nsentiments on old age into the mouth of Cato, and the circumstances of the\r\nsupposed conversation (3).\r\n\r\n  INTRODUCTORY CONVERSATION    4-9.\r\n\r\nScipio declares his admiration of Cato's vigorous and happy old age. Cato\r\nreplies that the secret lies in following the guidance of Nature (4, 5).\r\nLaelius then asks Cato to point out the road to such an old age as his own\r\n(6). This the old man promises to do, but first remarks that the faults\r\ncharged against old age are generally due to defects of character (7).\r\nLaelius suggests that prosperity makes Cato's declining years pleasant.\r\nCato admits that there may be some truth in this, but maintains that right\r\ncharacter alone can make old age tolerable (8, 9).\r\n\r\n  CATO'S DEFENCE OF OLD AGE    10-85.\r\n\r\nA. Introductory argument from fact. Account of celebrated old men whose\r\nlives till death were useful and happy 10-14\r\n\r\n  (a). Fabius Maximus                                  10-12\r\n  (b). Plato; (c). Isocrates; (d). Gorgias                13\r\n  (e). Ennius                                             14\r\n\r\nB. Refutation of charges made against old age 15-85\r\n\r\n_Statement of the four charges commonly made against old age_: it withdraws\r\nmen from active life, it weakens the physical powers, it takes away\r\ncapacity for enjoyment, and it involves the anticipation of death 15\r\n\r\nA. Refutation of the first charge, that old age withdraws from active life.\r\n\r\n  (a). There are employments suited to old age which\r\n      are as necessary to the well-being of society as\r\n      those which require greater physical powers          15-20\r\n\r\n  (b). The special objection that old men have weak\r\n      memories is answered by showing that this is\r\n      due either to an original defect or to insufficient\r\n      exercise                                             21-22\r\n\r\n\r\n  (c). Argument from fact: instances of old men in\r\n      public and in private life who till death were\r\n      actively at work                                      23-26\r\n\r\nB. Rebuttal of the second charge, that old age weakens the physical powers.\r\n\r\n  (a). Old age does not desire nor require the strength\r\n      of youth, because it may exert influence\r\n      through other means. Instances cited to show\r\n      this                                                  27-32\r\n\r\n  (b). Temperate habits will retain a good measure\r\n      of strength till old age (33, 34); many instances\r\n      of weakness in old age may be attributed to\r\n      ill-health, which is common to all periods of\r\n      life (35); proper care will greatly  retard decay     33-38\r\n\r\nC. Refutation of the third charge, that old age takes away the capacity for\r\nenjoyment\r\n\r\n  (a). The pleasures in which youth finds its keenest\r\n      enjoyment are in themselves bad, and old age\r\n      is beneficent in freeing from their allurements       39-44\r\n\r\n  (b). Old age has pleasures far more refined and satisfying\r\n      than those of sense                                   45-64\r\n      Such as, those of conversation and literature\r\n      (45-50); especially those of agriculture (51-61);\r\n      and lastly, the exercise of influence, which old\r\n      age will always possess if a rightly spent youth\r\n      has preceded (62-64).\r\n\r\n  (c). The special objection that old men's tempers\r\n      spoil their enjoyments is met by the statement\r\n      that this is the fault of character, not of age          65\r\n\r\nD. Refutation of the fourth charge, that old age is unhappy because it\r\ninvolves the anticipation of death.\r\n\r\n  (a). Since the right aim of life is to live not long\r\n      but well, death ought not to be dreaded at any\r\n      age                                                   66-69\r\n\r\n\r\n  (b). Old men, especially those of learning and culture,\r\n      ought not to fear death                                       70-76\r\n      Because, that which is according to nature is\r\n      good, and it is natural for old men to die (70-73);\r\n      the process of dying is brief and almost painless\r\n      (74); even young men and those without learning\r\n      often set the example of despising death\r\n      (75); and old age, just as the other periods\r\n      of life, has finally its season of ripeness and\r\n      satiety (76).\r\n\r\n  (c). Death is probably the gateway to a happy immortality     77-85\r\n      Tending towards proof of this are the arguments\r\n      stated in Plato; viz. the rapidity of the\r\n      mind's action, its powers of memory and invention,\r\n      its self-activity, indivisible nature and pre-existence\r\n      (78); also the arguments, attributed\r\n      to Cyrus, based upon the soul's immateriality,\r\n      the posthumous fame of great men and the\r\n      likeness of death to sleep (79-81); the instinctive\r\n      belief in immortality, so strong as even to\r\n      form an incentive for action (82); and, finally,\r\n      the speaker's own longing after immortality and\r\n      hope of union with those whom he once knew\r\n      and loved (83-85).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCATO MAIOR DE SENECTUTE\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM.

Sed quid opus est plura? Iam enim ipsius Catonis sermo\r\nexplicabit nostram omnem de senectute sententiam.\r\n\r\nII. 4 SCIPIO. Saepe numero admirari soleo cum hoc C. Laelio cum ceterarum\r\nrerum tuam excellentem, M. Cato, perfectamque sapientiam, tum vel maxime\r\nquod numquam tibi senectutem gravem esse senserim, quae plerisque senibus\r\nsic odiosa est, ut onus se Aetna gravius dicant sustinere.\r\n\r\nCATO. Rem haud sane, Scipio et Laeli, difficilem admirari videmini. Quibus\r\nenim nihil est in ipsis opis ad bene beateque vivendum, eis omnis aetas\r\ngravis est: qui autem omnia bona a se ipsi petunt, eis nihil potest malum\r\nvideri quod naturae necessitas afferat. Quo in genere est in primis\r\nsenectus, quam ut adipiscantur omnes optant, eandem accusant adeptam: tanta\r\nest stultitiae inconstantia atque perversitas. Obrepere aiunt eam citius\r\nquam putassent. Primum quis coegit eos falsum putare? Qui enim citius\r\nadulescentiae senectus quam pueritiae adulescentia obrepit? Deinde qui\r\nminus gravis esset eis senectus, si octingentesimum annum agerent, quam si\r\noctogesimum? Praeterita enim aetas quamvis longa, cum effluxisset, nulla\r\nconsolatione permulcere posset stultam senectutem. 5 Quocirca si sapientiam\r\nmeam admirari soletis, quae utinam digna esset opinione vestra nostroque\r\ncognomine, in hoc sumus sapientes, quod naturam optimam ducem tamquam deum\r\nsequimur eique paremus: a qua non veri simile est, cum ceterae partes\r\naetatis bene descriptae sint, extremum actum tamquam ab inerti poeta esse\r\nneglectum. Sed tamen necesse fuit esse aliquid extremum et, tamquam in\r\narborum bacis terraeque fructibus, maturitate tempestiva quasi vietum et\r\ncaducum, quod ferundum est molliter sapienti. Quid est enim aliud Gigantum\r\nmodo bellare cum dis nisi naturae repugnare?\r\n\r\n6 LAELIUS. Atqui, Cato, gratissimum nobis, ut etiam pro Scipione pollicear,\r\nfeceris, si, quoniam speramus, volumus quidem certe, senes fieri, multo\r\nante a te didicerimus quibus facillime rationibus ingravescentem aetatem\r\nferre possimus.\r\n\r\nCATO. Faciam vero, Laeli, praesertim si utrique vestrum, ut dicis, gratum\r\nfuturum est.\r\n\r\nLAELIUS. Volumus sane, nisi molestum est, Cato, tamquam longam aliquam viam\r\nconfeceris, quam nobis quoque ingrediundum sit, istuc, quo pervenisti,\r\nvidere quale sit.\r\n\r\nIII. 7 CATO. Faciam ut potero, Laeli. Saepe enim interfui querellis\r\naequalium meorum, pares autem vetere proverbio cum paribus facillime\r\ncongregantur, quae C. Salinator, quae Sp. Albinus, homines consulares,\r\nnostri fere aequales, deplorare solebant, tum quod voluptatibus carerent,\r\nsine quibus vitam nullam putarent, tum quod spernerentur ab eis, a quibus\r\nessent coli soliti; qui mihi non id videbantur accusare, quod esset\r\naccusandum. Nam si id culpa senectutis accideret, eadem mihi usu venirent\r\nreliquisque omnibus maioribus natu, quorum ego multorum cognovi senectutem\r\nsine querella, qui se et libidinum vinculis laxatos esse non moleste\r\nferrent nec a suis despicerentur. Sed omnium istius modi querellarum in\r\nmoribus est culpa, non in aetate. Moderati enim et nec difficiles nec\r\ninhumani senes tolerabilem senectutem agunt, importunitas autem et\r\ninhumanitas omni aetati molesta est.\r\n\r\n8 LAELIUS. Est, ut dicis, Cato; sed fortasse dixerit quispiam tibi propter\r\nopes et copias et dignitatem tuam tolerabiliorem senectutem videri, id\r\nautem non posse multis contingere.\r\n\r\nCATO. Est istuc quidem, Laeli, aliquid, sed nequaquam in isto sunt omnia;\r\nut Themistocles fertur Seriphio cuidam in iurgio respondisse, cum ille\r\ndixisset non eum sua, sed patriae gloria splendorem assecutum: 'nec\r\nhercule', inquit, 'si ego Seriphius essem, nec tu, si Atheniensis, clarus\r\numquam fuisses'. Quod eodem modo de senectute dici potest; nec enim in\r\nsumma inopia levis esse senectus potest, ne sapienti quidem, nec insipienti\r\netiam in summa copia non gravis. 9 Aptissima omnino sunt, Scipio et Laeli,\r\narma senectutis artes exercitationesque virtutum, quae in omni aetate\r\ncultae, cum diu multumque vixeris, mirificos ecferunt fructus, non solum\r\nquia numquam deserunt, ne extremo quidem tempore aetatis, quamquam id\r\nquidem maximum est, verum etiam quia conscientia bene actae vitae\r\nmultorumque bene factorum recordatio iucundissima est.\r\n\r\nIV. 10 Ego Q. Maximum, eum qui Tarentum recepit, senem adulescens ita\r\ndilexi, ut aequalem. Erat enim in illo viro comitate condita gravitas, nec\r\nsenectus mores mutaverat. Quamquam eum colere coepi non admodum grandem\r\nnatu, sed tamen iam aetate provectum. Anno enim post consul primum fuerat\r\nquam ego natus sum, cumque eo quartum consule adulescentulus miles ad\r\nCapuam profectus sum quintoque anno post ad Tarentum. Quaestor deinde\r\nquadriennio post factus sum, quem magistratum gessi consulibus Tuditano et\r\nCethego, cum quidem ille admodum senex suasor legis Cinciae de donis et\r\nmuneribus fuit. Hic et bella gerebat ut adulescens, cum plane grandis\r\nesset, et Hannibalem iuveniliter exsultantem patientia sua molliebat; de\r\nquo praeclare familiaris noster Ennius:\r\n\r\n  _unus homo nobis cunctando restituit rem;_\r\n  _noenum rumores ponebat ante salutem;_\r\n  _ergo plusque magisque viri nunc gloria claret._\r\n\r\n11 Tarentum vero qua vigilantia, quo consilio recepit! Cum quidem me\r\naudiente Salinatori, qui amisso oppido fugerat in arcem, glorianti atque\r\nita dicenti, 'mea opera, Q. Fabi, Tarentum recepisti', 'certe', inquit\r\nridens, 'nam nisi tu amisisses, numquam recepissem'. Nec vero in armis\r\npraestantior quam in toga; qui consul iterum, Sp. Carvilio collega\r\nquiescente, C. Flaminio tribuno plebis, quoad potuit, restitit agrum\r\nPicentem et Gallicum viritim contra senatus auctoritatem dividenti,\r\naugurque cum esset, dicere ausus est optimis auspiciis ea geri, quae pro\r\nrei publicae salute gererentur; quae contra rem publicam ferrentur, contra\r\nauspicia ferri. 12 Multa in eo viro praeclara cognovi, sed nihil\r\nadmirabilius quam quo modo ille mortem fili tulit, clari viri et\r\nconsularis. Est in manibus laudatio, quam cum legimus, quem philosophum non\r\ncontemnimus? Nec vero ille in luce modo atque in oculis civium magnus, sed\r\nintus domique praestantior. Qui sermo, quae praecepta! Quanta notitia\r\nantiquitatis, scientia iuris auguri! Multae etiam, ut in homine Romano,\r\nlitterae: omnia memoria tenebat non domestica solum, sed etiam externa\r\nbella. Cuius sermone ita tum cupide fruebar, quasi iam divinarem, id quod\r\nevenit, illo exstincto fore unde discerem neminem.\r\n\r\nV. 13 Quorsus igitur haec tam multa de Maximo? Quia profecto videtis nefas\r\nesse dictu miseram fuisse talem senectutem. Nec tamen omnes possunt esse\r\nScipiones aut Maximi, ut urbium expugnationes, ut pedestris navalisve\r\npugnas, ut bella a se gesta, ut triumphos recordentur. Est etiam quiete et\r\npure atque eleganter actae aetatis placida ac lenis senectus, qualem\r\naccepimus Platonis, qui uno et octogesimo anno scribens est mortuus, qualem\r\nIsocrati, qui eum librum, qui Panathenaicus inscribitur, quarto nonagesimo\r\nanno scripsisse dicit vixitque quinquennium postea; cuius magister\r\nLeontinus Gorgias centum et septem complevit annos, neque umquam in suo\r\nstudio atque opere cessavit. Qui, cum ex eo quaereretur cur tam diu vellet\r\nesse in vita, 'nihil habeo,' inquit, 'quod accusem senectutem'. Praeclarum\r\nresponsum et docto homine dignum! 14 Sua enim vitia insipientes et suam\r\nculpam in senectutem conferunt, quod non faciebat is, cuius modo mentionem\r\nfeci, Ennius:\r\n\r\n  _sic ut fortis ecus, spatio qui saepe supremo_\r\n  _vicit Olumpia, nunc senio confectus quiescit._\r\n\r\nEqui fortis et victoris senectuti comparat suam; quem quidem probe\r\nmeminisse potestis; anno enim undevicesimo post eius mortem hi consules, T.\r\nFlamininus et M'. Acilius, facti sunt; ille autem Caepione et Philippo\r\niterum consulibus mortuus est, cum ego quinque et sexaginta annos natus\r\nlegem Voconiam magna voce et bonis lateribus suasissem. Annos septuaginta\r\nnatus, tot enim vixit Ennius, ita ferebat duo quae maxima putantur, onera,\r\npaupertatem et senectutem, ut eis paene delectari videretur.\r\n\r\n15 Etenim, cum complector animo, quattuor reperio causas cur senectus\r\nmisera videatur: unam, quod avocet a rebus gerendis; alteram, quod corpus\r\nfaciat infirmius; tertiam, quod privet omnibus fere voluptatibus; quartam,\r\nquod haud procul absit a morte. Earum, si placet, causarum quanta quamque\r\nsit iusta una quaeque videamus.\r\n\r\nVI. A rebus gerendis senectus abstrahit. Quibus? An eis, quae iuventute\r\ngeruntur et viribus? Nullaene igitur res sunt seniles, quae vel infirmis\r\ncorporibus animo tamen administrentur? Nihil ergo agebat Q. Maximus, nihil\r\nL. Paulus, pater tuus, socer optimi viri fili mei? Ceteri senes, Fabricii\r\nCurii Coruncanii, cum rem publicam consilio et auctoritate defendebant,\r\nnihil agebant? 16 Ad Appi Claudi senectutem accedebat etiam ut caecus\r\nesset; tamen is, cum sententia senatus inclinaret ad pacem cum Pyrrho\r\nfoedusque faciendum, non dubitavit dicere illa, quae versibus persecutus\r\nest Ennius:\r\n\r\n  _quo vobis mentes, rectae quae stare solebant_\r\n  _antehac, dementis sese flexere viai?_\r\n\r\nceteraque gravissime, notum enim vobis carmen est, et tamen ipsius Appi\r\nexstat oratio. Atque haec ille egit septemdecim annis post alterum\r\nconsulatum, cum inter duos consulatus anni decem interfuissent censorque\r\nante superiorem consulatum fuisset, ex quo intellegitur Pyrrhi bello\r\ngrandem sane fuisse, et tamen sic a patribus accepimus. 17 Nihil igitur\r\nafferunt qui in re gerenda versari senectutem negant, similesque sunt ut si\r\nqui gubernatorem in navigando nihil agere dicant, cum alii malos scandant,\r\nalii per foros cursent, alii sentinam exhauriant, ille clavum tenens\r\nquietus sedeat in puppi, non faciat ea, quae iuvenes. At vero multo maiora\r\net meliora facit. Non viribus aut velocitate aut celeritate corporum res\r\nmagnae geruntur, sed consilio auctoritate sententia, quibus non modo non\r\norbari, sed etiam augeri senectus solet; 18 nisi forte ego vobis, qui et\r\nmiles et tribunus et legatus et consul versatus sum in vario genere\r\nbellorum, cessare nunc videor, cum bella non gero. At senatui quae sint\r\ngerenda praescribo et quo modo; Carthagini male iam diu cogitanti bellum\r\nmulto ante denuntio, de qua vereri non ante desinam quam illam exscisam\r\nesse cognovero. 19 Quam palmam utinam di immortales, Scipio, tibi\r\nreservent, ut avi relliquias persequare, cuius a morte tertius hic et\r\ntricesimus annus est, sed memoriam illius viri omnes excipient anni\r\nconsequentes. Anno ante me censorem mortuus est, novem annis post meum\r\nconsulatum, cum consul iterum me consule creatus esset. Num igitur, si ad\r\ncentesimum annum vixisset, senectutis eum suae paeniteret? Nec enim\r\nexcursione nec saltu, nec eminus hastis aut comminus gladiis uteretur, sed\r\nconsilio ratione sententia, quae nisi essent in senibus, non summum\r\nconsilium maiores nostri appellassent senatum. 20 Apud Lacedaemonios quidem\r\nei, qui amplissimum magistratum gerunt, ut sunt, sic etiam nominantur\r\nsenes. Quod si legere aut audire voletis externa, maximas res publicas ab\r\nadulescentibus labefactatas, a senibus sustentatas et restitutas\r\nreperietis.\r\n\r\n  _Cedo qui vestram rem publicam tantam amisistis tam cito?_\r\n\r\nsic enim percontantur in Naevi poetae Ludo. Respondentur et alia et hoc in\r\nprimis:\r\n\r\n  _proveniebant oratores novi, stulti adulescentuli._\r\n\r\nTemeritas est videlicet florentis aetatis, prudentia senescentis.\r\n\r\nVII. 21 At memoria minuitur. Credo, nisi eam exerceas, aut etiam si sis\r\nnatura tardior. Themistocles omnium civium perceperat nomina; num igitur\r\ncensetis eum, cum aetate processisset, qui Aristides esset Lysimachum\r\nsalutare solitum? Equidem non modo eos novi qui sunt, sed eorum patres\r\netiam et avos, nec sepulcra legens vereor, quod aiunt, ne memoriam perdam;\r\nhis enim ipsis legendis in memoriam redeo mortuorum. Nec vero quemquam\r\nsenem audivi oblitum, quo loco thesaurum obruisset. Omnia quae curant\r\nmeminerunt, vadimonia constituta, quis sibi, cui ipsi debeant. 22 Quid\r\niuris consulti, quid pontifices, quid augures, quid philosophi senes? Quam\r\nmulta meminerunt! Manent ingenia senibus, modo permaneat studium et\r\nindustria, neque ea solum claris et honoratis viris, sed in vita etiam\r\nprivata et quieta. Sophocles ad summam senectutem tragoedias fecit; quod\r\npropter studium cum rem neglegere familiarem videretur, a filiis in\r\niudicium vocatus est, ut, quem ad modum nostro more male rem gerentibus\r\npatribus bonis interdici solet, sic illum quasi desipientem a re familiari\r\nremoverent iudices. Tum senex dicitur eam fabulam quam in manibus habebat\r\net proxime scripserat, Oedipum Coloneum, recitasse iudicibus quaesisseque\r\nnum illud carmen desipientis videretur, quo recitato sententiis iudicum est\r\nliberatus. 23 Num igitur hunc, num Homerum Hesiodum Simoniden Stesichorum,\r\nnum quos ante dixi Isocraten Gorgian, num philosophorum principes,\r\nPythagoran Democritum, num Platonem Xenocraten, num postea Zenonem\r\nCleanthen, aut eum, quem vos etiam vidistis Romae, Diogenen Stoicum coegit\r\nin suis studiis obmutiscere senectus? An in omnibus studiorum agitatio\r\nvitae aequalis fuit? 24 Age, ut ista divina studia omittamus, possum\r\nnominare ex agro Sabino rusticos Romanos, vicinos et familiaris meos,\r\nquibus absentibus numquam fere ulla in agro maiora opera fiunt, non\r\nserendis, non percipiendis, non condendis fructibus. Quamquam in aliis\r\nminus hoc mirum est, nemo enim est tam senex qui se annum non putet posse\r\nvivere; sed idem in eis elaborant, quae sciunt nihil ad se omnino\r\npertinere:\r\n\r\n  _serit arbores, quae alteri saeclo prosint,_\r\n\r\nut ait Statius noster in Synephebis. 25 Nec vero dubitat agricola, quamvis\r\nsit senex, quaerenti cui serat respondere: 'dis immortalibus, qui me non\r\naccipere modo haec a maioribus voluerunt, sed etiam posteris prodere'.\r\n\r\nVIII. Et melius Caecilius de sene alteri saeculo prospiciente, quam illud\r\nidem:\r\n\r\n  _edepol, senectus, si nil quicquam aliud viti_\r\n  _adportes tecum, cum advenis, unum id sat est,_\r\n  _quod diu vivendo multa quae non volt videt._\r\n\r\nEt multa fortasse quae volt, atque in ea, quae non volt, saepe etiam\r\nadulescentia incurrit. Illud vero idem Caecilius vitiosius:\r\n\r\n  _tum equidem in senecta hoc deputo miserrimum,_\r\n  _sentire ea aetate eumpse esse odiosum alteri._\r\n\r\n26 Iucundum potius quam odiosum! Ut enim adulescentibus bona indole\r\npraeditis sapientes senes delectantur, leviorque fit senectus eorum qui a\r\niuventute coluntur et diliguntur, sic adulescentes senum praeceptis\r\ngaudent, quibus ad virtutum studia ducuntur, nec minus intellego me vobis\r\nquam mihi vos esse iucundos. Sed videtis, ut senectus non modo languida\r\natque iners non sit, verum etiam sit operosa et semper agens aliquid et\r\nmoliens, tale scilicet, quale cuiusque studium in superiore vita fuit.\r\nQuid, qui etiam addiscunt aliquid, ut et Solonem versibus gloriantem\r\nvidemus, qui se cotidie aliquid addiscentem dicit senem fieri, et ego feci,\r\nqui litteras Graecas senex didici, quas quidem sic avide arripui quasi\r\ndiuturnam sitim explere cupiens, ut ea ipsa mihi nota essent, quibus me\r\nnunc exemplis uti videtis. Quod cum fecisse Socraten in fidibus audirem,\r\nvellem equidem etiam illud, discebant enim fidibus antiqui, sed in litteris\r\ncerte elaboravi.\r\n\r\nIX. 27 Ne nunc quidem viris desidero adulescentis, is enim erat locus alter\r\nde vitiis senectutis, non plus quam adulescens tauri aut elephanti\r\ndesiderabam. Quod est, eo decet uti et quidquid agas agere pro viribus.\r\nQuae enim vox potest esse contemptior quam Milonis Crotoniatae? Qui cum iam\r\nsenex esset athletasque se exercentis in curriculo videret, aspexisse\r\nlacertos suos dicitur illacrimansque dixisse, 'at hi quidem mortui iam\r\nsunt'. Non vero tam isti, quam tu ipse, nugator, neque enim ex te umquam es\r\nnobilitatus, sed ex lateribus et lacertis tuis. Nihil Sex. Aelius tale,\r\nnihil multis annis ante Ti. Coruncanius, nihil modo P. Crassus, a quibus\r\niura civibus praescribebantur, quorum usque ad extremum spiritum est\r\nprovecta prudentia. 28 Orator metuo ne languescat senectute: est enim munus\r\neius non ingeni solum, sed laterum etiam et virium. Omnino canorum illud in\r\nvoce splendescit etiam nescio quo pacto in senectute, quod equidem adhuc\r\nnon amisi, et videtis annos. Sed tamen est decorus seni sermo quietus et\r\nremissus, facitque persaepe ipsa sibi audientiam diserti senis composita et\r\nmitis oratio, quam si ipse exsequi nequeas, possis tamen Scipioni\r\npraecipere et Laelio. Quid enim est iucundius senectute stipata studiis\r\niuventutis? 29 An ne illas quidem viris senectuti relinquimus, ut\r\nadulescentis doceat, instituat, ad omne offici munus instruat? Quo quidem\r\nopere quid potest esse praeclarius? Mihi vero et Cn. et P. Scipiones et avi\r\ntui duo L. Aemilius et P. Africanus comitatu nobilium iuvenum fortunati\r\nvidebantur, nec ulli bonarum artium magistri non beati putandi, quamvis\r\nconsenuerint vires atque defecerint. Etsi ipsa ista defectio virium\r\nadulescentiae vitiis efficitur saepius quam senectute; libidinosa enim et\r\nintemperans adulescentia effetum corpus tradit senectuti. 30 Cyrus quidem\r\napud Xenophontem eo sermone, quem moriens habuit, cum admodum senex esset,\r\nnegat se umquam sensisse senectutem suam imbecilliorem factam quam\r\nadulescentia fuisset. Ego L. Metellum memini puer, qui, cum quadriennio\r\npost alterum consulatum pontifex maximus factus esset, viginti et duos\r\nannos ei sacerdotio praefuit, ita bonis esse viribus extremo tempore\r\naetatis, ut adulescentiam non requireret. Nihil necesse est mihi de me ipso\r\ndicere, quamquam est id quidem senile aetatique nostrae conceditur. X. 31\r\nVidetisne, ut apud Homerum saepissime Nestor de virtutibus suis praedicet?\r\nTertiam enim aetatem hominum videbat, nec erat ei verendum ne vera\r\npraedicans de se nimis videretur aut insolens aut loquax. Etenim, ut ait\r\nHomerus, ex eius lingua melle dulcior fluebat oratio; quam ad suavitatem\r\nnullis egebat corporis viribus. Et tamen dux ille Graeciae nusquam optat ut\r\nAiacis similis habeat decem, sed ut Nestoris, quod si sibi acciderit, non\r\ndubitat quin brevi sit Troia peritura. 32 Sed redeo ad me. Quartum ago\r\nannum et octogesimum: vellem equidem idem posse gloriari quod Cyrus, sed\r\ntamen hoc queo dicere, non me quidem eis esse viribus, quibus aut miles\r\nbello Punico aut quaestor eodem bello aut consul in Hispania fuerim aut\r\nquadriennio post, cum tribunus militaris depugnavi apud Thermopylas M'.\r\nGlabrione consule; sed tamen, ut vos videtis, non plane me enervavit, non\r\nafflixit senectus: non curia viris meas desiderat, non rostra, non amici,\r\nnon clientes, non hospites. Nec enim umquam sum assensus veteri illi\r\nlaudatoque proverbio, quod monet mature fieri senem, si diu velis senex\r\nesse. Ego vero me minus diu senem esse mallem quam esse senem ante quam\r\nessem. Itaque nemo adhuc convenire me voluit cui fuerim occupatus. 33 At\r\nminus habeo virium quam vestrum utervis. Ne vos quidem T. Ponti centurionis\r\nviris habetis: num idcirco est ille praestantior? Moderatio modo virium\r\nadsit et tantum quantum potest quisque nitatur, ne ille non magno desiderio\r\ntenebitur virium. Olympiae per stadium ingressus esse Milo dicitur, cum\r\numeris sustineret bovem: utrum igitur has corporis an Pythagorae tibi malis\r\nviris ingeni dari? Denique isto bono utare, dum adsit, cum absit, ne\r\nrequiras: nisi forte adulescentes pueritiam, paulum aetate progressi\r\nadulescentiam debent requirere. Cursus est certus aetatis et una via\r\nnaturae eaque simplex, suaque cuique parti aetatis tempestivitas est data,\r\nut et infirmitas puerorum et ferocitas iuvenum et gravitas iam constantis\r\naetatis et senectutis maturitas naturale quiddam habet, quod suo tempore\r\npercipi debeat. 34 Audire te arbitror, Scipio, hospes tuus avitus Masinissa\r\nquae faciat hodie nonaginta natus annos: cum ingressus iter pedibus sit, in\r\nequum omnino non ascendere; cum autem equo, ex equo non descendere; nullo\r\nimbri, nullo frigore adduci ut capite operto sit; summam esse in eo\r\ncorporis siccitatem, itaque omnia exsequi regis officia et munera. Potest\r\nigitur exercitatio et temperantia etiam in senectute conservare aliquid\r\npristini roboris.\r\n\r\nXI. Ne sint in senectute vires: ne postulantur quidem vires a senectute.\r\nErgo et legibus et institutis vacat aetas nostra muneribus eis quae non\r\npossunt sine viribus sustineri. Itaque non modo quod non possumus, sed ne\r\nquantum possumus quidem cogimur. 35 At multi ita sunt imbecilli senes, ut\r\nnullum offici aut omnino vitae munus exsequi possint. At id quidem non\r\nproprium senectutis vitium est, sed commune valetudinis. Quam fuit\r\nimbecillus P. Africani filius, is qui te adoptavit, quam tenui aut nulla\r\npotius valetudine! Quod ni ita fuisset, alterum illud exstitisset lumen\r\ncivitatis; ad paternam enim magnitudinem animi doctrina uberior accesserat.\r\nQuid mirum igitur in senibus, si infirmi sunt aliquando, cum id ne\r\nadulescentes quidem effugere possint? Resistendum, Laeli et Scipio,\r\nsenectuti est, eiusque vitia diligentia compensanda sunt, pugnandum tamquam\r\ncontra morbum sic contra senectutem, 36 habenda ratio valetudinis, utendum\r\nexercitationibus modicis, tantum cibi et potionis adhibendum, ut\r\nreficiantur vires, non opprimantur. Nec vero corpori solum subveniendum\r\nest, sed menti atque animo multo magis. Nam haec quoque, nisi tamquam\r\nlumini oleum instilles, exstinguuntur senectute. Et corpora quidem\r\nexercitationum defetigatione ingravescunt, animi autem exercitando\r\nlevantur. Nam quos ait Caecilius 'comicos stultos senes,' hos significat\r\ncredulos obliviosos dissolutos, quae vitia sunt non senectutis, sed inertis\r\nignavae somniculosae senectutis. Ut petulantia, ut libido magis est\r\nadulescentium quam senum, nec tamen omnium adulescentium, sed non proborum,\r\nsic ista senilis stultitia, quae deliratio appellari solet, senum levium\r\nest, non omnium. 37 Quattuor robustos filios, quinque filias, tantam domum,\r\ntantas clientelas Appius regebat et caecus et senex; intentum enim animum\r\ntamquam arcum habebat nec languescens succumbebat senectuti. Tenebat non\r\nmodo auctoritatem, sed etiam imperium in suos: metuebant servi, verebantur\r\nliberi, carum omnes habebant; vigebat in illo animus patrius et disciplina.\r\n38 Ita enim senectus honesta est, si se ipsa defendit, si ius suum retinet,\r\nsi nemini emancipata est, si usque ad ultimum spiritum dominatur in suos.\r\nUt enim adulescentem in quo est senile aliquid, sic senem in quo est\r\naliquid adulescentis probo, quod qui sequitur, corpore senex esse poterit,\r\nanimo numquam erit. Septimus mihi liber Originum est in manibus; ommia\r\nantiquitatis monumenta colligo; causarum illustrium, quascunque defendi,\r\nnunc cum maxime conficio orationes; ius augurium pontificium civile tracto;\r\nmultum etiam Graecis litteris utor, Pythagoriorumque more, exercendae\r\nmemoriae gratia, quid quoque die dixerim audierim egerim commemoro vesperi.\r\nHae sunt exercitationes ingeni, haec curricula mentis; in his desudans\r\natque elaborans corporis viris non magno opere desidero. Adsum amicis,\r\nvenio in senatum frequens ultroque affero res multum et diu cogitatas\r\neasque tueor animi, non corporis viribus. Quas si exsequi nequirem, tamen\r\nme lectulus meus oblectaret ea ipsa cogitantem, quae iam agere non possem;\r\nsed ut possim facit acta vita. Semper enim in his studiis laboribusque\r\nviventi non intellegitur quando obrepat senectus: ita sensim sine sensu\r\naetas senescit nec subito frangitur, sed diuturnitate exstinguitur.\r\n\r\nXII. 39 Sequitur tertia vituperatio senectutis, quod eam carere dicunt\r\nvoluptatibus. O praeclarum munus aetatis, si quidem id aufert a nobis, quod\r\nest in adulescentia vitiosissimum! Accipite enim, optimi adulescentes,\r\nveterem orationem Archytae Tarentini, magni in primis et praeclari viri,\r\nquae mihi tradita est cum essem adulescens Tarenti cum Q. Maximo. Nullam\r\ncapitaliorem pestem quam voluptatem corporis hominibus dicebat a natura\r\ndatam, cuius voluptatis avidae libidines temere et ecfrenate ad potiendum\r\nincitarentur. Hinc patriae proditiones, 40 hinc rerum publicarum\r\neversiones, hinc cum hostibus clandestina colloquia nasci; nullum denique\r\nscelus, nullum malum facinus esse ad quod suscipiendum non libido\r\nvoluptatis impelleret; stupra vero et adulteria et omne tale flagitium\r\nnullis excitari aliis illecebris nisi voluptatis; cumque homini sive natura\r\nsive quis deus nihil mente praestabilius dedisset, huic divino muneri ac\r\ndono nihil tam esse inimicum quam voluptatem. 41 Nec enim libidine\r\ndominante temperantiae locum esse, neque omnino in voluptatis regno\r\nvirtutem posse consistere. Quod quo magis intellegi posset, fingere animo\r\niubebat tanta incitatum aliquem voluptate corporis, quanta percipi posset\r\nmaxima: nemini censebat fore dubium quin tam diu, dum ita gauderet, nihil\r\nagitare mente, nihil ratione, nihil cogitatione consequi posset. Quocirca\r\nnihil esse tam detestabile tamque pestiferum quam voluptatem, si quidem ea,\r\ncum maior esset atque longior, omne animi lumen exstingueret. Haec cum C.\r\nPontio Samnite, patre eius, a quo Caudino proelio Sp. Postumius T. Veturius\r\nconsules superati sunt, locutum Archytam Nearchus Tarentinus hospes noster,\r\nqui in amicitia populi Romani permanserat, se a maioribus natu accepisse\r\ndicebat, cum quidem ei sermoni interfuisset Plato Atheniensis, quem\r\nTarentum venisse L. Camillo Ap. Claudio consulibus reperio. 42 Quorsus hoc?\r\nUt intellegeretis, si voluptatem aspernari ratione et sapientia non\r\npossemus, magnam esse habendam senectuti gratiam, quae efficeret ut id non\r\nliberet quod non oporteret. Impedit enim consilium voluptas, rationi\r\ninimica est, mentis ut ita dicam praestringit oculos, nec habet ullum cum\r\nvirtute commercium. Invitus feci ut fortissimi viri T. Flaminini fratrem L.\r\nFlamininum e senatu eicerem septem annis post quam consul fuisset, sed\r\nnotandam putavi libidinem. Ille enim cum esset consul in Gallia exoratus in\r\nconvivio a scorto est ut securi feriret aliquem eorum qui in vinculis\r\nessent, damnati rei capitalis. Hic Tito fratre suo censore, qui proximus\r\nante me fuerat, elapsus est, mihi vero et Flacco neutiquam probari potuit\r\ntam flagitiosa et tam perdita libido, quae cum probro privato coniungeret\r\nimperi dedecus.\r\n\r\nXIII. 43 Saepe audivi e maioribus natu, qui se porro pueros a senibus\r\naudisse dicebant, mirari solitum C. Fabricium quod, cum apud regem Pyrrhum\r\nlegatus esset, audisset a Thessalo Cinea esse quendam Athenis qui se\r\nsapientem profiteretur, eumque dicere omnia quae faceremus ad voluptatem\r\nesse referenda. Quod ex eo audientis M'. Curium et Ti. Coruncanium optare\r\nsolitos ut id Samnitibus ipsique Pyrrho persuaderetur, quo facilius vinci\r\npossent cum se voluptatibus dedissent. Vixerat M'. Curius cum P. Decio, qui\r\nquinquennio ante eum consulem se pro re publica quarto consulatu devoverat:\r\nnorat eundem Fabricius, norat Coruncanius, qui cum ex sua vita tum ex eius\r\nquem dico. Deci facto iudicabant esse profecto aliquid natura pulchrum\r\natque praeclarum, quod sua sponte expeteretur quodque spreta et contempta\r\nvoluptate optimus quisque sequeretur. 44 Quorsum igitur tam multa de\r\nvoluptate? Quia non modo vituperatio nulla, sed etiam summa laus senectutis\r\nest, quod ea voluptates nullas magno opere desiderat. Caret epulis\r\nexstructisque mensis et frequentibus poculis. Caret ergo etiam vinulentia\r\net cruditate et insomniis. Sed si aliquid dandum est voluptati, quoniam\r\neius blanditiis non facile obsistimus, divine enim Plato escam malorum\r\nappellat voluptatem quod ea videlicet homines capiantur ut pisces, quamquam\r\nimmoderatis epulis caret senectus, modicis tamen conviviis delectari\r\npotest. C. Duellium M. F., qui Poenos classe primus devicerat, redeuntem a\r\ncena senem saepe videbam puer; delectabatur cereo funali et tibicine, quae\r\nsibi nullo exemplo privatus sumpserat: tantum licentiae dabat gloria. 45\r\nSed quid ego alios? Ad me ipsum iam revertar. Primum habui semper\r\nsodalis--sodalitates autem me quaestore constitutae sunt sacris Idaeis\r\nMagnae Matris acceptis--epulabar igitur cum sodalibus, omnino modice, sed\r\nerat quidam fervor aetatis, qua progrediente omnia fiunt in dies mitiora.\r\nNeque enim ipsorum conviviorum delectationem voluptatibus corporis magis\r\nquam coetu amicorum et sermonibus metiebar; bene enim maiores accubitionem\r\nepularem amicorum, quia vitae coniunctionem haberet, convivium\r\nnominaverunt, melius quam Graeci, qui hoc idem tum compotationem, tum\r\nconcenationem vocant, ut, quod in eo genere minimum est, id maxime probare\r\nvideantur.\r\n\r\nXIV. 46 Ego vero propter sermonis delectationem tempestivis quoque\r\nconviviis delector, nec cum aequalibus solum, qui pauci admodum restant,\r\nsed cum vestra etiam aetate atque vobiscum, habeoque senectuti magnam\r\ngratiam, quae mihi sermonis aviditatem auxit, potionis et cibi sustulit.\r\nQuod si quem etiam ista delectant, ne omnino bellum indixisse videar\r\nvoluptati, cuius est fortasse quidam naturalis modus, non intellego ne in\r\nistis quidem ipsis voluptatibus carere sensu senectutem. Me vero et\r\nmagisteria delectant a maioribus instituta et is sermo, qui more maiorum a\r\nsummo adhibetur in poculo, et pocula sicut in Symposio Xenophontis est,\r\nminuta atque rorantia, et refrigeratio aestate et vicissim aut sol aut\r\nignis hibernus. Quae quidem etiam in Sabinis persequi soleo conviviumque\r\nvicinorum cotidie compleo, quod ad multam noctem quam maxime possumus vario\r\nsermone producimus. 47 At non est voluptatum tanta quasi titillatio in\r\nsenibus. Credo, sed ne desideratio quidem; nihil autem est molestum quod\r\nnon desideres. Bene Sophocles, cum ex eo quidam iam affecto aetate\r\nquaereret, utereturne rebus veneriis, 'di meliora!' inquit; 'ego vero\r\nistinc sicut a domino agresti ac furioso profugi.' Cupidis enim rerum\r\ntalium odiosum fortasse et molestum est carere, satiatis vero et expletis\r\niucundius est carere quam frui; quamquam non caret is, qui non desiderat;\r\nergo hoc non desiderare dico esse iucundius. 48 Quod si istis ipsis\r\nvoluptatibus bona aetas fruitur libentius, primum parvulis fruitur rebus,\r\nut diximus, deinde eis, quibus senectus, etiam si non abunde potitur, non\r\nomnino caret. Ut Turpione Ambivio magis delectatur qui in prima cavea\r\nspectat, delectatur tamen etiam qui in ultima, sic adulescentia voluptates\r\npropter intuens magis fortasse laetatur, sed delectatur etiam senectus,\r\nprocul eas spectans, tantum quantum sat est. 49 At illa quanti sunt, animum\r\ntamquam emeritis stipendiis libidinis ambitionis, contentionum\r\ninimicitiarum, cupiditatum omnium secum esse secumque, ut dicitur, vivere!\r\nSi vero habet aliquod tamquam pabulum studi atque doctrinae, nihil est\r\notiosa senectute iucundius. Videbamus in studio dimetiendi paene caeli\r\natque terrae Gallum familiarem patris tui, Scipio. Quotiens ilium lux noctu\r\naliquid describere ingressum, quotiens nox oppressit cum mane coepisset!\r\nQuam delectabat eum defectiones solis et lunae multo ante nobis praedicere!\r\n50 Quid in levioribus studiis, sed tamen acutis? Quam gaudebat Bello suo\r\nPunico Naevius, quam Truculento Plautus, quam Pseudolo! Vidi etiam senem\r\nLivium, qui, cum sex annis ante quam ego natus sum fabulam docuisset\r\nCentone Tuditanoque consulibus, usque ad adulescentiam meam processit\r\naetate. Quid de P. Licini Crassi et pontifici et civilis iuris studio\r\nloquar aut de huius P. Scipionis, qui his paucis diebus pontifex maximus\r\nfactus est? Atque eos omnis, quos commemoravi, his studiis flagrantis senes\r\nvidimus. M. vero Cethegum, quem recte suadae medullam dixit Ennius, quanto\r\nstudio exerceri in dicendo videbamus etiam senem! Quae sunt igitur epularum\r\naut ludorum aut scortorum voluptates cum his voluptatibus comparandae?\r\nAtque haec quidem studia doctrinae, quae quidem prudentibus et bene\r\ninstitutis pariter cum aetate crescunt, ut honestum illud Solonis sit, quod\r\nait versiculo quodam, ut ante dixi, senescere se multa in dies addiscentem,\r\nqua voluptate animi nulla certe potest esse maior.\r\n\r\nXV. 51 Venio nunc ad voluptates agricolarum, quibus ego incredibiliter\r\ndelector, quae nec ulla impediuntur senectute et mihi ad sapientis vitam\r\nproxime videntur accedere. Habent enim rationem cum terra, quae numquam\r\nrecusat imperium nec umquam sine usura reddit quod accepit, sed alias\r\nminore, plerumque maiore cum faenore; quamquam me quidem non fructus modo,\r\nsed etiam ipsius terrae vis ac natura delectat. Quae cum gremio mollito ac\r\nsubacto sparsum semen excepit, primum id occaecatum cohibet, ex quo occatio\r\nquae hoc efficit nominata est; deinde tepefactum vapore et compressu suo\r\ndiffundit et elicit herbescentem ex eo viriditatem, quae nixa fibris\r\nstirpium sensim adolescit culmoque erecta geniculato vaginis iam quasi\r\npubescens includitur; e quibus cum emersit, fundit frugem spici ordine\r\nstructam et contra avium minorum morsus munitur vallo aristarum. 52 Quid\r\nego vitium ortus satus incrementa commemorem? Satiari delectatione non\r\npossum, ut meae senectutis requietem oblectamentumque noscatis. Omitto enim\r\nvim ipsam omnium quae generantur e terra, quae ex fici tantulo grano aut ex\r\nacini vinaceo aut ex ceterarum frugum aut stirpium minutissimis seminibus\r\ntantos truncos ramosque procreet; malleoli plantae sarmenta viviradices\r\npropagines nonne efficiunt ut quemvis cum admiratione delectent? Vitis\r\nquidem quae natura caduca est et, nisi fulta est, fertur ad terram, eadem,\r\nut se erigat, claviculis suis quasi manibus quidquid est nacta\r\ncomplectitur, quam serpentem multiplici lapsu et erratico, ferro amputans\r\ncoercet ars agricolarum, ne silvescat sarmentis et in omnis partis nimia\r\nfundatur. 53 Itaque ineunte vere in eis quae relicta sunt exsistit tamquam\r\nad articulos sarmentorum ea quae gemma dicitur, a qua oriens uva se\r\nostendit, quae et suco terrae et calore solis augescens primo est peracerba\r\ngustatu, dein maturata dulcescit vestitaque pampinis nec modico tepore\r\ncaret et nimios solis defendit ardores: qua quid potest esse cum fructu\r\nlaetius, tum aspectu pulchrius? Cuius quidem non utilitas me solum, ut ante\r\ndixi, sed etiam cultura et natura ipsa delectat: adminiculorum ordines,\r\ncapitum iugatio, religatio et propagatio vitium, sarmentorum ea, quam dixi,\r\naliorum amputatio, aliorum immissio. Quid ego irrigationes, quid fossiones\r\nagri repastinationesque proferam quibus fit multo terra fecundior? 54 Quid\r\nde utilitate loquar stercorandi? Dixi in eo libro, quem de rebus rusticis\r\nscripsi. De qua doctus Hesiodus ne verbum quidem fecit, cum de cultura agri\r\nscriberet. At Homerus, qui multis, ut mihi videtur, ante saeculis fuit,\r\nLaerten lenientem desiderium, quod capiebat e filio, colentem agrum et eum\r\nstercorantem facit. Nec vero segetibus solum et pratis et vineis et\r\narbustis res rusticae laetae sunt, sed hortis etiam et pomariis, tum\r\npecudum pastu, apium examinibus, florum omnium varietate. Nec consitiones\r\nmodo delectant, sed etiam insitiones, quibus nihil invenit agri cultura\r\nsollertius.\r\n\r\nXVI. 55 Possum persequi permulta oblectamenta rerum rusticarum, sed ea ipsa\r\nquae dixi sentio fuisse longiora. Ignoscetis autem, nam et studio rerum\r\nrusticarum provectus sum, et senectus est natura loquacior, ne ab omnibus\r\neam vitiis videar vindicare. Ergo in hac vita M'. Curius, cum de\r\nSamnitibus, de Sabinis, de Pyrrho triumphavisset, consumpsit extremum\r\ntempus aetatis; cuius quidem ego villam contemplans, abest enim non longe a\r\nme, admirari satis non possum vel hominis ipsius continentiam vel temporum\r\ndisciplinam. Curio ad focum sedenti magnum auri pondus Samnites cum\r\nattulissent, repudiati sunt; non enim aurum habere praeclarum sibi videri\r\ndixit, sed eis qui haberent aurum imperare. 56 Poteratne tantus animus\r\nefficere non iucundam senectutem? Sed venio ad agricolas, ne a me ipso\r\nrecedam. In agris erant tum senatores, id est senes, si quidem aranti L.\r\nQuinctio Cincinnato nuntiatum est eum dictatorem esse factum, cuius\r\ndictatoris iussu magister equitum C. Servilius Ahala Sp. Maelium regnum\r\nappetentem occupatum interemit. A villa in senatum arcessebatur et Curius\r\net ceteri senes, ex quo qui eos arcessebant viatores nominati sunt. Num\r\nigitur horum senectus miserabilis fuit, qui se agri cultione oblectabant?\r\nMea quidem sententia haud scio an nulla beatior possit esse, neque solum\r\nofficio, quod hominum generi universo cultura agrorum est salutaris, sed et\r\ndelectatione quam dixi, et saturitate copiaque rerum omnium, quae ad victum\r\nhominum, ad cultum etiam deorum pertinent, ut, quoniam haec quidam\r\ndesiderant, in gratiam iam cum voluptate redeamus. Semper enim boni\r\nassiduique domini referta cella vinaria, olearia, etiam penaria est,\r\nvillaque tota locuples est, abundat porco haedo agno gallina, lacte caseo\r\nmelle. Iam hortum ipsi agricolae succidiam alteram appellant. Conditiora\r\nfacit haec supervacaneis etiam operis aucupium atque venatio. 57 Quid de\r\npratorum viriditate aut arborum ordinibus aut vinearum olivetorumve specie\r\nplura dicam? Brevi praecidam. Agro bene culto nihil potest esse nec usu\r\nuberius nec specie ornatius, ad quem fruendum non modo non retardat, verum\r\netiam invitat atque allectat senectus. Ubi enim potest illa aetas aut\r\ncalescere vel apricatione melius vel igni, aut vicissim umbris aquisve\r\nrefrigerari salubrius? 58 Sibi habeant igitur arma, sibi equos, sibi\r\nhastas, sibi clavam et pilam, sibi venationes atque cursus, nobis senibus\r\nex lusionibus multis talos relinquant et tesseras; id ipsum ut lubebit,\r\nquoniam sine eis beata esse senectus potest.\r\n\r\nXVII. 59 Multas ad res perutiles Xenophontis libri sunt, quos legite quaeso\r\nstudiose, ut facitis. Quam copiose ab eo agri cultura laudatur in eo libro,\r\nqui est de tuenda re familiari, qui Oeconomicus inscribitur! Atque ut\r\nintellegatis nihil ei tam regale videri quam studium agri colendi, Socrates\r\nin eo libro loquitur cum Critobulo Cyrum minorem Persarum regem,\r\npraestantem ingenio atque imperi gloria, cum Lysander Lacedaemonius, vir\r\nsummae virtutis, venisset ad eum Sardis eique dona a sociis attulisset, et\r\nceteris in rebus communem erga Lysandrum atque humanum fuisse et ei quendam\r\nconsaeptum agrum diligenter consitum ostendisse. Cum autem admiraretur\r\nLysander et proceritates arborum et directos in quincuncem ordines et humum\r\nsubactam atque puram et suavitatem odorum qui afflarentur ex floribus, tum\r\neum dixisse mirari se non modo diligentiam sed etiam sollertiam eius a quo\r\nessent illa dimensa atque discripta; et Cyrum respondisse 'atqui ego ista\r\nsum omnia dimensus, mei sunt ordines, mea discriptio; multae etiam istarum\r\narborum mea manu sunt satae.' Tum Lysandrum, intuentem purpuram eius et\r\nnitorem corporis ornatumque Persicum multo auro multisque gemmis, dixisse\r\n'recte vero te, Cyre, beatum ferunt, quoniam virtuti tuae fortuna coniuncta\r\nest!' 60 Hac igitur fortuna frui licet senibus, nec aetas impedit quo minus\r\net ceterarum rerum et in primis agri colendi studia teneamus usque ad\r\nultimum tempus senectutis. M. quidem Valerium Corvinum accepimus ad\r\ncentesimum annum perduxisse, cum esset acta iam aetate in agris eosque\r\ncoleret, cuius inter primum et sextum consulatum sex et quadraginta anni\r\ninterfuerunt. Ita quantum spatium aetatis maiores ad senectutis initium\r\nesse voluerunt, tantus illi cursus honorum fuit; atque huius extrema aetas\r\nhoc beatior quam media, quod auctoritatis habebat plus, laboris minus; apex\r\nest autem senectutis auctoritas. 61 Quanta fuit in L. Caecilio Metello,\r\nquanta in A. Atilio Calatino! In quem illud elogium:\r\n\r\n  _hunc unum plurimae consentiunt gentes_\r\n  _populi primarium fuisse virum._\r\n\r\nNotum est totum carmen incisum in sepulcro. Iure igitur gravis, cuius de\r\nlaudibus omnium esset fama consentiens. Quem virum nuper P. Crassum,\r\npontificem maximum, quem postea M. Lepidum eodem sacerdotio praeditum\r\nvidimus! Quid de Paulo aut Africano loquar, aut, ut iam ante, de Maximo?\r\nQuorum non in sententia solum, sed etiam in nutu residebat auctoritas.\r\nHabet senectus, honorata praesertim, tantam auctoritatem, ut ea pluris sit\r\nquam omnes adulescentiae voluptates.\r\n\r\nXVIII. 62 Sed in omni oratione mementote eam me senectutem laudare, quae\r\nfundamentis adulescentiae constituta sit. Ex quo efficitur id, quod ego\r\nmagno quondam cum assensu omnium dixi, miseram esse senectutem quae se\r\noratione defenderet. Non cani nec rugae repente auctoritatem arripere\r\npossunt, sed honeste acta superior aetas fructus capit auctoritatis\r\nextremos. 63 Haec enim ipsa sunt honorabilia, quae videntur levia atque\r\ncommunia, salutari appeti decedi assurgi deduci reduci consuli, quae et\r\napud nos et in aliis civitatibus, ut quaeque optime morata est, ita\r\ndiligentissime observantur. Lysandrum Lacedaemonium, cuius modo feci\r\nmentionem, dicere aiunt solitum Lacedaemonem esse honestissimum domicilium\r\nsenectutis; nusquam enim tantum tribuitur aetati, nusquam est senectus\r\nhonoratior. Quin etiam memoriae proditum est, cum Athenis ludis quidam in\r\ntheatrum grandis natu venisset, magno consessu locum nusquam ei datum a\r\nsuis civibus, cum autem ad Lacedaemonios accessisset, qui, legati cum\r\nessent certo in loco considerant, consurrexisse omnes illi dicuntur et\r\nsenem sessum recepisse; 64 quibus cum a cuncto consessu plausus esset\r\nmultiplex datus, dixisse ex eis quendam Atheniensis scire quae recta\r\nessent, sed facere nolle. Multa in nostro collegio praeclara, sed hoc de\r\nquo agimus, in primis, quod, ut quisque aetate antecedit, ita sententiae\r\nprincipatum tenet, neque solum honore antecedentibus, sed eis etiam, qui\r\ncum imperio sunt, maiores natu augures anteponuntur. Quae sunt igitur\r\nvoluptates corporis cum auctoritatis praemiis comparandae? Quibus qui\r\nsplendide usi sunt, ei mihi videntur fabulam aetatis peregisse nec tamquam\r\ninexercitati histriones in extremo actu corruisse.\r\n\r\n65 At sunt morosi et anxii et iracundi et difficiles senes. Si quaerimus,\r\netiam avari; sed haec morum vitia sunt, non senectutis. Ac morositas tamen\r\net ea vitia, quae dixi, habent aliquid excusationis, non illius quidem\r\niustae, sed quae probari posse videatur: contemni se putant, despici,\r\nilludi; praeterea in fragili corpore odiosa omnis offensio est; quae tamen\r\nomnia dulciora fiunt et moribus bonis et artibus, idque cum in vita tum in\r\nscaena intellegi potest ex eis fratribus qui in Adelphis sunt. Quanta in\r\naltero diritas, in altero comitas! Sic se res habet: ut enim non omne\r\nvinum, sic non omnis natura vetustate coacescit. Severitatem in senectute\r\nprobo, sed eam, sicut alia, modicam; acerbitatem nullo modo; 66 avaritia\r\nvero senilis quid sibi velit, non intellego. Potest enim quicquam esse\r\nabsurdius quam, quo viae minus restet, eo plus viatici quaerere?\r\n\r\nXIX. Quarta restat causa, quae maxime angere atque sollicitam habere\r\nnostram aetatem videtur, appropinquatio mortis, quae certe a senectute non\r\npotest esse longe. O miserum senem, qui mortem contemnendam esse in tam\r\nlonga aetate non viderit! Quae aut plane neglegenda est, si omnino\r\nexstinguit animum, aut etiam optanda, si aliquo eum deducit ubi sit futurus\r\naeternus. Atqui tertium certe nihil inveniri potest. 67 Quid igitur timeam,\r\nsi aut non miser post mortem, aut beatus etiam futurus sum? Quamquam quis\r\nest tam stultus, quamvis sit adulescens, cui sit exploratum se ad vesperum\r\nesse victurum? Quin etiam aetas illa multo pluris quam nostra casus mortis\r\nhabet: facilius in morbos incidunt adulescentes, gravius aegrotant,\r\ntristius curantur. Itaque pauci veniunt ad senectutem; quod ni ita\r\naccideret, melius et prudentius viveretur. Mens enim et ratio et consilium\r\nin senibus est, qui si nulli fuissent, nullae omnino civitates fuissent.\r\nSed redeo ad mortem impendentem. Quod est istud crimen senectutis, cum id\r\nei videatis cum adulescentia esse commune? 68 Sensi ego in optimo filio, tu\r\nin exspectatis ad amplissimam dignitatem fratribus, Scipio, mortem omni\r\naetati esse communem. At sperat adulescens diu se victurum, quod sperare\r\nidem senex non potest. Insipienter sperat; quid enim stultius quam incerta\r\npro certis habere, falsa pro veris? At senex ne quod speret quidem habet.\r\nAt est eo meliore condicione quam adulescens, quoniam id quod ille sperat\r\nhic consecutus est: ille volt diu vivere, hic diu vixit. 69 Quamquam, o di\r\nboni, quid est in hominis natura diu? Da enim supremum tempus, exspectemus\r\nTartessiorum regis aetatem: fuit enim, ut scriptum video, Arganthonius\r\nquidam Gadibus, qui octoginta regnaverat annos, centum viginti vixerat.\r\n\r\nSed mihi ne diuturnum quidem quicquam videtur, in quo est aliquid extremum;\r\ncum enim id advenit, tum illud quod praeteriit, effluxit; tantum remanet,\r\nquod virtute et recte factis consecutus sis. Horae quidem cedunt et dies et\r\nmenses et anni, nec praeteritum tempus umquam revertitur nec quid sequatur\r\nsciri potest. Quod cuique temporis ad vivendum datur, eo debet esse\r\ncontentus. 70 Neque enim histrioni, ut placeat, peragenda fabula est, modo\r\nin quocunque fuerit actu probetur; neque sapientibus usque ad 'plaudite'\r\nveniendum est, breve enim tempus aetatis satis longum est ad bene\r\nhonesteque vivendum; sin processerit longius, non magis dolendum est, quam\r\nagricolae dolent praeterita verni temporis suavitate aestatem autumnumque\r\nvenisse. Ver enim tamquam adulescentia significat ostenditque fructus\r\nfuturos; reliqua autem tempora demetendis fructibus et percipiendis\r\naccommodata sunt. 71 Fructus autem senectutis est, ut saepe dixi, ante\r\npartorum bonorum memoria et copia. Omnia autem, quae secundum naturam\r\nfiunt, sunt habenda in bonis; quid est autem tam secundum naturam quam\r\nsenibus emori? Quod idem contingit adulescentibus adversante et repugnante\r\nnatura. Itaque adulescentes mihi mori sic videntur, ut cum aquae\r\nmultitudine flammae vis opprimitur, senes autem sic, ut cum sua sponte,\r\nnulla adhibita vi, consumptus ignis exstinguitur, et quasi poma ex\r\narboribus, cruda si sunt, vix evelluntur, si matura et cocta, decidunt, sic\r\nvitam adulescentibus vis aufert, senibus maturitas; quae quidem mihi tam\r\niucunda est, ut, quo propius ad mortem accedam, quasi terram videre videar\r\naliquandoque in portum ex longa navigatione esse venturus.\r\n\r\nXX. 72 Senectutis autem nullus est certus terminus, recteque in ea vivitur,\r\nquoad munus offici exsequi et tueri possit mortemque contemnere, ex quo fit\r\nut animosior etiam senectus sit quam adulescentia et fortior. Hoc illud\r\nest, quod Pisistrato tyranno a Solone responsum est, cum illi quaerenti qua\r\ntandem re fretus sibi tam audaciter obsisteret respondisse dicitur\r\n'senectute.' Sed vivendi est finis optimus, cum integra mente certisque\r\nsensibus opus ipsa suum eadem quae coagmentavit natura dissolvit. Ut navem,\r\nut aedificium idem destruit facillime qui construxit, sic hominem eadem\r\noptime quae conglutinavit natura dissolvit. Iam omnis conglutinatio recens\r\naegre, inveterata facile divellitur. Ita fit ut illud breve vitae reliquum\r\nnec avide appetendum senibus nec sine causa deserendum sit; vetatque\r\nPythagoras iniussu imperatoris, id est dei, de praesidio et statione vitae\r\ndecedere. 73 Solonis quidem sapientis est elogium, quo se negat velle suam\r\nmortem dolore amicorum et lamentis vacare. Volt, credo, se esse carum suis.\r\nSed haud scio an melius Ennius:\r\n\r\n  _nemo me lacrumis decoret, neque funera fletu_\r\n  _faxit_\r\n\r\n74 Non censet lugendam esse mortem, quam immortalitas consequatur. Iam\r\nsensus moriendi aliquis esse potest, isque ad exiguum tempus, praesertim\r\nseni: post mortem quidem sensus aut optandus aut nullus est. Sed hoc\r\nmeditatum ab adulescentia debet esse, mortem ut neglegamus; sine qua\r\nmeditatione tranquillo animo esse nemo potest. Moriendum enim certe est, et\r\nincertum an hoc ipso die. Mortem igitur omnibus horis impendentem timens\r\nqui poterit animo consistere? 75 De qua non ita longa disputatione opus\r\nesse videtur, cum recorder non L. Brutum, qui in liberanda patria est\r\ninterfectus, non duos Decios, qui ad voluntariam mortem cursum equorum\r\nincitaverunt, non M. Atilium, qui ad supplicium est profectus ut fidem\r\nhosti datam conservaret non duos Scipiones, qui iter Poenis vel corporibus\r\nsuis obstruere voluerunt, non avum tuum L. Paulum, qui morte luit collegae\r\nin Cannensi ignominia temeritatem, non M. Marcellum, cuius interitum ne\r\ncrudelissimus quidem hostis honore sepulturae carere passus est, sed\r\nlegiones nostras, quod scripsi in Originibus, in eum locum saepe profectas\r\nalacri animo et erecto, unde se redituras numquam arbitrarentur. Quod\r\nigitur adulescentes, et ei quidem non solum indocti sed etiam rustici\r\ncontemnunt, id docti senes extimescent? 76 Omnino, ut mihi quidem videtur,\r\nrerum omnium satietas vitae facit satietatem. Sunt pueritiae studia certa:\r\nnum igitur ea desiderant adulescentes? Sunt ineuntis adulescentiae: num ea\r\nconstans iam requirit aetas, quae media dicitur? Sunt etiam eius aetatis:\r\nne ea quidem quaeruntur in senectute. Sunt extrema quaedam studia\r\nsenectutis: ergo, ut superiorum aetatum studia occidunt, sic occidunt etiam\r\nsenectutis; quod cum evenit, satietas vitae tempus maturum mortis affert.\r\n\r\nXXI. 77 Non enim video, cur, quid ipse sentiam de morte, non audeam vobis\r\ndicere, quod eo cernere mihi melius videor, quo ab ea propius absum. Ego\r\nvestros patres, P. Scipio tuque, C. Laeli, viros clarissimos mihique\r\namicissimos, vivere arbitror et eam quidem vitam, quae est sola vita\r\nnominanda. Nam dum sumus inclusi in his compagibus corporis, munere quodam\r\nnecessitatis et gravi opere perfungimur; est enim animus caelestis ex\r\naltissimo domicilio depressus et quasi demersus in terram, locum divinae\r\nnaturae eternitatique contrarium. Sed credo deos immortalis sparsisse\r\nanimos in corpora humana, ut essent qui terras tuerentur quique caelestium\r\nordinem contemplantes imitarentur eum vitae modo atque constantia. Nec me\r\nsolum ratio ac disputatio impulit ut ita crederem, sed nobilitas etiam\r\nsummorum philosophorum et auctoritas.\r\n\r\n78 Audiebam Pythagoran Pythagoriosque, incolas paene nostros, qui essent\r\nItalici philosophi quondam nominati numquam dubitasse quin ex universa\r\nmente divina delibatos animos haberemus. Demonstrabantur mihi praeterea\r\nquae Socrates supremo vitae die de immortalitate animorum disseruisset, is\r\nqui esset omnium sapientissimus oraculo Apollinis iudicatus. Quid multa?\r\nSic mihi persuasi, sic sentio, cum tanta celeritas animorum sit, tanta\r\nmemoria praeteritorum futurorumque prudentia, tot artes tantae scientiae,\r\ntot inventa, non posse eam naturam, quae res eas contineat, esse mortalem;\r\ncumque semper agitetur animus nec principium motus habeat, quia se ipse\r\nmoveat, ne finem quidem habiturum esse motus, quia numquam se ipse sit\r\nrelicturus; et cum simplex animi natura esset neque haberet in se quicquam\r\nadmixtum dispar sui atque dissimile, non posse eum dividi, quod si non\r\nposset, non posse interire; magnoque esse argumento homines scire pleraque\r\nante quam nati sint, quod iam pueri, cum artis difficilis discant, ita\r\nceleriter res innumerabilis arripiant, ut eas non tum primum accipere\r\nvideantur, sed reminisci et recordari. Haec Platonis fere. XXII. 79 Apud\r\nXenophontem autem moriens Cyrus maior haec dicit: 'nolite arbitrari, o mihi\r\ncarissimi filii, me, cum a vobis discessero, nusquam aut nullum fore. Nec\r\nenim, dum eram vobiscum, animum meum videbatis, sed eum esse in hoc corpora\r\nex eis rebus quas gerebam intellegebatis. Eundem igitur esse creditote,\r\netiam si nullum videbitis. 80 Nec vero clarorum virorum post mortem honores\r\npermanerent, si nihil eorum ipsorum animi efficerent, quo diutius memoriam\r\nsui teneremus. Mihi quidem numquam persuaderi potuit animos dum in\r\ncorporibus essent mortalibus vivere, cum excessissent ex eis emori; nec\r\nvero tum animum esse insipientem cum ex insipienti corpore evasisset, sed\r\ncum omni admixtione corporis liberatus purus et integer esse coepisset, tum\r\nesse sapientem. Atque etiam, cum hominis natura morte dissolvitur,\r\nceterarum rerum perspicuum est quo quaeque discedat, abeunt enim illuc\r\nomnia, unde orta sunt; animus autem solus nec cum adest nec cum discessit\r\napparet. Iam vero videtis nihil esse morti tam simile quam somnum. 81 Atqui\r\ndormientium animi maxime declarant divinitatem suam; multa enim, cum\r\nremissi et liberi sunt, futura prospiciunt; ex quo intellegitur quales\r\nfuturi sint, cum se plane corporis vinculis relaxaverint. Qua re, si haec\r\nita sunt, sic me colitote,' inquit, 'ut deum, sin una est interiturus\r\nanimus cum corpore, vos tamen, deos verentes, qui hanc omnem pulchritudinem\r\ntuentur et regunt, memoriam nostri pie inviolateque servabitis.'\r\n\r\nXXIII. 82 Cyrus quidem haec moriens; nos, si placet, nostra videamus. Nemo\r\numquam mihi, Scipio, persuadebit aut patrem tuum Paulum, aut duos avos\r\nPaulum et Africanum, aut Africani patrem aut patruum, aut multos\r\npraestantis viros, quos enumerare non est necesse, tanta esse conatos quae\r\nad posteritatis memoriam pertinerent, nisi animo cernerent posteritatem ad\r\nipsos pertinere. Anne censes, ut de me ipse aliquid more senum glorier, me\r\ntantos labores diurnos nocturnosque domi militiaeque suscepturum fuisse, si\r\nisdem finibus gloriam meam quibus vitam essem terminaturus? Nonne melius\r\nmulto fuisset otiosam et quietam aetatem sine ullo labore et contentione\r\ntraducere? Sed nescio quo modo animus erigens se posteritatem ita semper\r\nprospiciebat, quasi, cum excessisset e vita, tum denique victurus esset.\r\nQuod quidem ni ita se haberet ut animi immortales essent, haud optimi\r\ncuiusque animus maxime ad immortalitatis gloriam niteretur. 83 Quid quod\r\nsapientissimus quisque aequissimo animo moritur, stultissimus iniquissimo,\r\nnonne vobis videtur is animus, qui plus cernat et longius, videre se ad\r\nmeliora proficisci, ille autem, cuius obtusior sit acies, non videre?\r\nEquidem efferor studio patres vestros quos colui et dilexi videndi, neque\r\nvero eos solum convenire aveo, quos ipse cognovi, sed illos etiam, de\r\nquibus audivi et legi et ipse conscripsi; quo quidem me proficiscentem haud\r\nsane quid facile retraxerit, nec tamquam Pelian recoxerit. Et si quis deus\r\nmihi largiatur ut ex hac aetate repuerascam et in cunis vagiam, valde\r\nrecusem, nec vero velim quasi decurso spatio ad carceres a calce revocari.\r\n84 Quid habet enim vita commodi? Quid non potius laboris? Sed habeat sane;\r\nhabet certe tamen aut satietatem aut modum. Non libet enim mihi deplorare\r\nvitam, quod multi et ei docti saepe fecerunt, neque me vixisse paenitet,\r\nquoniam ita vixi, ut non frustra me natum existimem, et ex vita ita discedo\r\ntamquam ex hospitio, non tamquam e domo; commorandi enim natura divorsorium\r\nnobis, non habitandi dedit. O praeclarum diem cum in illud divinum animorum\r\nconcilium coetumque proficiscar cumque ex hac turba et colluvione discedam!\r\nProficiscar enim non ad eos solum viros, de quibus ante dixi, verum etiam\r\nad Catonem meum, quo nemo vir melior natus est, nemo pietate praestantior,\r\ncuius a me corpus est crematum, quod contra decuit ab illo meum, animus\r\nvero non me deserens sed respectans, in ea profecto loca discessit quo mihi\r\nipsi cernebat esse veniendum. Quem ego meum casum fortiter ferre visus sum,\r\nnon quo aequo animo ferrem, sed me ipse consolabar existimans non\r\nlonginquum inter nos digressum et discessum fore.\r\n\r\n85 His mihi rebus, Scipio, id enim te cum Laelio admirari solere dixisti,\r\nlevis est senectus, nec solum non molesta, sed etiam iucunda. Quod si in\r\nhoc erro, qui animos hominum immortalis esse credam, libenter erro nec mihi\r\nhunc errorem, quo delector, dum vivo, extorqueri volo; sin mortuus, ut\r\nquidam minuti philosophi censent, nihil sentiam, non vereor ne hunc errorem\r\nmeum philosophi mortui irrideant. Quod si non sumus immortales futuri,\r\ntamen exstingui homini suo tempore optabile est. Nam habet natura, ut\r\naliarum omnium rerum, sic vivendi modum. Senectus autem aetatis est\r\nperactio tamquam fabulae, cuius defetigationem fugere debemus, praesertim\r\nadiuncta satietate.\r\n\r\nHaec habui de senectute quae dicerem, ad quam utinam veniatis, ut ea, quae\r\nex me audistis, re experti probare possitis!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOTES TO CATO MAIOR.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCATO MAIOR DE SENECTUTE (CATO THE ELDER ON OLD AGE). CATO MAIOR was\r\nprobably intended by Cicero as the principal title. He twice gives the work\r\nthis name, in Laelius 4 and Att. 14, 21, 1. In the former passage he adds\r\nthe descriptive words, addressed to Atticus, _qui est scriptus ad te de\r\nsenectute._ In a third notice, De Div. 2, 3, he gives the description\r\nwithout the title, _liber is quem ad nostrum Atticum de senectute misimus._\r\nIt is likely that Cicero intended the essay to be known as the CATO MAIOR\r\nDE SENECTUTE, the full title corresponding with LAELIUS DE AMICITIA. The\r\nword _maior_ was necessary to distinguish the book from Cicero's eulogy of\r\nthe younger Cato (Uticensis), which seems to have gone by the name of CATO\r\nsimply.\r\n\r\nP. 1. -- 1. O TITE etc.: the lines are a quotation from the _Annales_ of Q.\r\nEnnius (born at Rudiae in Calabria 239 B.C., died 169), an epic poem in\r\nhexameter verse, the first great Latin poem in that metre, celebrating the\r\nachievements of the Roman nation from the time of Aeneas to the poet's own\r\ndays. The incident alluded to in Ennius' verses is evidently the same as\r\nthat narrated by Livy 32, cc. 9, 10. Titus Quinctius Flamininus, who\r\ncommanded in 198 B.C. the Roman army opposed to Philip of Macedon, found\r\nthe king strongly posted on the mountains between Epirus and Thessaly. For\r\nforty days Flamininus lingered, hoping to find some path which would give\r\nhim access to the enemy's quarters. A shepherd who knew every nook of the\r\nmountains came before the general, and promised to lead the Roman soldiers\r\nto the ground above Philip's camp. This was done, and Flamininus drove the\r\nMacedonians into Thessaly. It is the shepherd who in the first line\r\naddresses Flamininus by his first name Titus. Cicero here cleverly applies\r\nthe lines to his life-long friend Titus Pomponius Atticus. He several times\r\ntakes the two words _'O Tite'_ to designate the whole treatise; cf. Att.\r\n16, 11, 3 _'O Tite' tibi prodesse laetor_. -- QUID: accusative of respect\r\nor extent; so _nihil_ in 30, _aliquid_ in 82. A.[56] 240, _a_; G. 331, 3;\r\nH. 378, 2. -- ADI[)U]ERO: for _adi[=u]vero,_ the long vowel having become\r\nshort after the falling out of the _v_ between the two vowels. Catullus 66,\r\n18 has _i[)u]erint_ at the end of a pentameter verse, and the same scanning\r\nis found in Plautus and Terence. A. 128, _a_; G. 151, 1; H. 235. --\r\nLEVASSO: a form of _levavero,_ which was originally _levaveso_. For the\r\nformation of this class of future-perfects see Peile, _Introduction to\r\nGreek and Latin Etymology,_ p. 295, ed. 3; also Roby, _Gram._ 1, p. 199,\r\nwho has a list of examples; he supports a different view from that given\r\nabove; cf. A. 128, _e_, 3; G. 191, 5; H. 240, 4. -- COQUIT: 'vexes.' This\r\nmetaphorical use of _coquere_ occurs in poetry and late prose; cf. Plaut.\r\nTrin. 225 _egomet me coquo et macero et defetigo_; Verg. Aen. 7, 345 _quam\r\n... femineae ardentem curaeque iraeque coquebant_; Quint. 12, 10, 77\r\n_sollititudo oratorem macerat et coquit_. -- VERS[=A]T: we have here the\r\noriginal quantity of the vowel preserved, as in _poneb[=a]t_ below, 10; the\r\n_a_ in _versat_ was originally as long as the _a_ in _vers[=a]s_. Plautus\r\nhas some parallels to this scanning (see Corssen, Aussprache 11², 488), but\r\nit is rarely imitated by poets of the best period. Horace, however, has\r\n_ar[=a]t_, Odes 3, 16, 26. A. 375, _g_, 5; H. 580, III n. 2. -- PRAEMI: the\r\ngenitive in _ĭ-ī_ from nouns in _ium_ only began to come into use at the\r\nend of the Republic. A. 40, _b_; G. 29, Rem. 1; H. 51, 5. -- ISDEM: Cicero\r\nmay have written _isdem_ or _eisdem_ (two syllables), but he probably did\r\nnot write the form most commonly found in our texts, _iisdem._ H. p. 74,\r\nfoot-note 2. -- FLAMININUM: T. Quinctius Flaminīnus first served against\r\nHannibal during the Second Punic War. He was present at the capture of\r\nTarentum in 209 B. c., and in 208 was military tribune under Marcellus.\r\nAfter being employed on minor business of state, he became quaestor in 199,\r\nand, immediately after his year of office, consul, passing over the\r\naedileship and praetorship, and attaining the consulship at the\r\nextraordinarily early age of 30. In 197 he won the victory of Cynoscephalae\r\nover the Macedonians, which ended the war. At the Isthmian games in the\r\nspring of 196 Flamininus made his famous proclamation of freedom to all the\r\nGreeks. He returned to Rome in 194 to enjoy a splendid triumph. For the\r\nrest of his life was employed chiefly on diplomatic business concerning\r\nGreece and the East. One of his embassies was to Prusias, king of Bithynia,\r\ncall on him to surrender Hannibal, who was living at his court in advanced\r\nold age; this led to Hannibal's suicide. Flamininus was censor in 189 (see\r\nbelow, 42), and lived on till some time after 167, in which year he became\r\naugur; but the date of his death is unknown. He was a man of brilliant\r\nability both as general and as diplomat, and also possessed much culture\r\nand was a great admirer of Greek literature. -- ILLE VIR etc.: _i.e._ the\r\nshepherd mentioned in n. on line 1. Livy 32, II, 4 says that Flamininus\r\nsent to the master of the shepherd, Charopus, an Epirote prince, to ask how\r\nfar he might be trusted. Charopus replied that Flamininus might trust him,\r\nbut had better keep a close watch on the operations himself. -- HAUD MAGNA\r\nCUM RE: 'of no great property'; _re_ = _re familiari_, as is often the case\r\nelsewhere in both verse and prose. Cf. pro Caelio 78 _hominem sine re. Cum_\r\nis literally 'attended by'; it is almost superfluous here, since _vir haud\r\nmagna re_ would have had just the same meaning. Madvig, Gram. § 258 has\r\nsimilar examples. -- PLENUS: final _s_ was so lightly pronounced that the\r\nolder poets felt justified in neglecting it in their scanning. It was\r\nprobably scarcely pronounced at all by the less educated Romans, since it\r\nis often wholly omitted in inscriptions, and has been lost in modern\r\nItalian. Cicero, Orator 161, says that the neglect to pronounce final _s_\r\nis 'somewhat boorish' (_subrusticum_), though formerly thought 'very\r\nrefined' (_politius_). Even Lucretius sometimes disregards it in his\r\nscanning. In the ordinary literary Latin a large number of words has lost\r\nan original _s_; _e.g._ all the nouns of the _-a_ declension. A. 375, _a_;\r\nG. 722; H. 608, 1, n. 3. -- FIDĒI: this form of the genitive of _fides_ is\r\nfound also in Plautus, Aulularia 575, and Lucretius 5, 102. _Fidĕi_ as\r\ngenitive seems only to occur in late poets, but as dative it is found in a\r\nfragment of Ennius. _Fidē_ as genitive occurs in Horace and Ovid. H. 585,\r\nIII. 1; Roby, 357, (c). -- QUAMQUAM: see n. on 2 _etsi_. -- SOLLICITARI\r\netc.: Cicero probably has not quoted the line as Ennius wrote it. The word\r\n_sic_, at least, is evidently inserted on purpose to correspond with _ut_\r\nbefore _Flamininum_, -- NOCTESQUE DIESQUE: the use of _que ... que_ for _et\r\n... et_ is almost entirely poetical, Sallust being the only prose writer of\r\nthe best period in whose works the usage is beyond doubt. _Noctes_ is put\r\nbefore _dies_ here, as in _noctes diesque_ (Verr. 5, 112), _noctes et dies_\r\n(Brut. 308 _etc._), _nodes ac dies_ (Arch. 29); cf. also Verg. Aen. 6, 127;\r\nand νυκτας τε και ημαρ in Iliad 5, 490; but the collocations _dies\r\nnoctesque_, _dies et noctes_ are far commoner in Cicero. Madvig (Emend.\r\nLiv. p. 487 n., ed 2) says that in writers of Livy's time and earlier, when\r\nan action is mentioned which continues throughout a number of days and\r\nnights, either _dies et noctes_ and the like phrases are used, or _die et\r\nnocte_ and the like, but not _diem noctemque_ or _diem et noctem,_ which\r\nexpression, he says, would imply that the action continued only throughout\r\n_one_ day and _one_ night. But Madvig has overlooked De Or. 2, 162 _eandem\r\nincu dem diem noctemque tundentibus;_ also three passages of Caesar: viz\r\nBell. Gall. 7, 42, 6 and 7, 77, 11; Bell. Civ. 1, 62, 1; to which add a\r\npassage in the Bell. Hisp. 38. Though _diem noctemque_ does often mean\r\n'throughout _one_ day and _one_ night' (as _e.g._ in Nep. Them. 8, 7), yet\r\nit would seem that the other sense cannot be excluded. -- MODERATIONEM ...\r\nAEQUITATEM: 'the self-control and even balance of your mind'. _Moderatio_\r\nis in Cic. a common translation of σωφροσυνη. _Aequitas_ is not used here\r\nin its commonest sense of 'reasonableness' or 'equity', but as the noun\r\ncorresponding to _aequus_ in the ordinary phrase _aequus animus_ (Horace,\r\n'_aequam memento rebus in arduis servare mentem_'), cf. Tusc. 1, 97 _hanc\r\nmaximi animi aequitatem in ipsa morte._ said of Theramenes' undisturbed\r\ncomposure before his execution. -- ANIMI TUI: for the position of these\r\nwords between _moderationem_ and _aequitatem_, to both of which nouns they\r\nrefer (a form of speech called by the Latin grammarians _coniunctio_), see\r\nnote on Laelius 8 _cum summi viri tum amicissimi_. -- COGNOMEN: _i.e._ the\r\nname _Atticus_, which Cicero's friend did not inherit, but adopted. For the\r\nword _cognomen_ cf. n. on 5. -- DEPORTASSE: it should be noted that the\r\nverb _deportare_ is nearly always in the best writers used of bringing\r\nthings from the provinces to Italy or Rome, and not _vice versa_, the\r\nRomans using 'down' (_de_) of motion towards the capital. _Italia\r\ndeportare_ occurs in Tacitus and late writers, but only in the sense of\r\nbanishing a person (cf. Ann 14, 45). So _decedere de provincia_ is common,\r\nbut not _Roma decedere_. As to the form _deportasse_, it may be remarked\r\nthat Cic. in the vast majority of instances uses the contracted and not the\r\nfull forms of the infinitives corresponding to perfects in -_avi_. So\r\n_putassent_ in 4. An extensive collection of examples of this and similar\r\ncontractions may be found in Frohwein, Die Perfectbildungen auf -vi bei\r\nCicero; Gera, 1874. -- HUMANITATEM: 'culture', _i.e._ learning resulting in\r\ngentleness and refinement of character. -- PRUDENTIAM: φρονησιν or\r\npractical wisdom. Corn. Nepos (or his imitator) in his life of Atticus 17,\r\n3 says of him _principum philosophorum ita percepta habuit praecepta ut his\r\nad vitam agendam non ad ostentationem uteretur_. -- ISDEM REBUS: _i.e._ the\r\nstate of public affairs at the time, see Introd. -- QUIBUS ME IPSUM:\r\nstrictly speaking the construction is inaccurate, since _suspicor\r\ncommoveri_ must be supplied, and Cicero does not really mean to say that he\r\nmerely _conjectures_ himself to be seriously affected by the state of\r\npublic affairs; _ego ipse commoveor_ would have accurately expressed his\r\nmeaning. The accusative is due to the attraction of _te_ above. -- MAIOR: =\r\n_difficilior_ as often; _e.g._ Lael. 29 _quod maius est_. -- VISUM EST MIHI\r\nCONSCRIBERE: = _placuit mihi_, 'I have determined to write'. The best\r\nwriters rarely use the impersonal _videtur etc._ followed by an infinitive.\r\nWhen the usage occurs _videtur mihi etc._ generally have the meaning (as\r\nhere) of δοκει μοι κ.τ.λ. = 'I have made up my mind'. Cf. Tusc. 5, 12 _Non\r\nmihi videtur ad beate vivendum satis posse virtutem_; ib. 5, 22 (a curious\r\npassage) _mihi enim non videbatur quisquam esse beatus posse cum esset in\r\nmalis; in malis autem sapientem esse posse_; Off. 3, 71 _malitia quae volt\r\nilla quidem videri se esse prudentiam_ ('craft which desires that people\r\nshould believe it to be wisdom'); Liv. 1, 10, 7 _dis visum nec irritam\r\nconditoris templi vocem esse_ ... ('the gods decided that the word of the\r\nfounder of the shrine should not remain of no effect'). It would be\r\ndifficult, if not impossible, to find a passage in a writer before silver\r\nLatin times where the best texts still exhibit anything like _videtur eum\r\nfacere_ for _is videtur facere_. H 534, 1, n. 1; Roby, 1353. -- ALIQUID AD\r\nTE: 'some work dedicated to you'; so below, 3; cf. also Lael. 4 _ut de\r\namicitia scriberem aliquid_; ib. _Catone maiore qui est scriptus ad te de\r\nsenectute_; Div. 2, 3 _liber is quem ad nostrum Atticum de senectute\r\nmisimus._\r\n\r\n2. AUT ... AUT CERTE: so often in Cic.; _certe_, 'at any rate'. --\r\nSENECTUTIS: at the time the words were written Cic. was 62 years old,\r\nAtticus three years older. For the meaning of _senectus_ see n. on 4. --\r\nLEVARI VOLO: the best Latin writers frequently use the passive infinitive\r\nafter verbs expressing desire, where moderns would incline to the active;\r\nhere Cic. instead of saying 'I wish to relieve yourself and me of the\r\nburden' says 'I wish yourself and me to be relieved'. -- ETSI: = καιτοι\r\n'and yet'. This use of _etsi_ to introduce a clause correcting the\r\npreceding clause, though not uncommon (_e.g._ below 29; Tusc. 1, 99; 3, 17;\r\n4, 63; 5, 55), is far less common than that of _quamquam_, which we have in\r\n1, 9, 10, 24, 47, 67, 69. -- TE QUIDEM: 'you at all events', 'you for one'.\r\n-- MODICE AC SAPIENTER: _modice_ recalls _moderationem_ above (_modice_ and\r\n_moderate_ are used with exactly the same sense by Cic.), while _sapienter_\r\nrecalls _aequitatem_, since _sapientia_ produces stability and an even\r\nbalance of the mind. In De Or. 1, 132 we have _modice et scienter_. --\r\nSICUT OMNIA: cf. Fin. 1, 7 _facete is quidem sicut alia_; also below, 65\r\n_sicut alia_. -- ET FERRE ET LATURUM ESSE: Tischer rightly remarks that\r\nwhen a verb is repeated thus with a variation of tense Cic. very nearly\r\nalways uses _et ... et_, and not a single _et_ merely. The contrast between\r\nthe two tenses is thus made more pointed. Cf. 3 _et diximus et dicemus_. --\r\nCERTO SCIO: one of the best MSS., followed by some editors, has here _certe\r\nscio_. The latter phrase would mean 'I am sure that I know' (a sense which\r\nseems out of place here); the former 'I have certain or sure knowledge'.\r\nObserve that _certe_ may be used with all verbs, while _certo_ is only used\r\nwith _scire_. A. 151, c. -- SED: the idea implied is, 'but though I well\r\nknow you do not need such consolation, I have yet resolved to address my\r\nbook to you'. -- OCCURREBAS DIGNUS: a condensed construction for\r\n_occurrebat te digmim esse_.\r\n\r\nP. 2. -- MUNERE ... UTERETUR: 'a gift such as we both might make use of in\r\ncompany'. -- MIHI QUIDEM: this forms a correction upon _uterque nostrum_\r\nabove: 'whatever you may think of the work, _I at least_ have found the\r\nwriting of it pleasant'. -- CONFECTIO: 'composition'; 'completion'; a word\r\nscarcely found in the classical Latin except in Cicero's writings. Cf. De\r\nOr. 2, 52 _annalium confectio;_ pro. Font. 3 _confectio tabularum_\r\n('account-books'). -- FUIT UT ABSTERSERIT: the sequence of tenses _fuit ut\r\nabstergeret_ would have been equally admissible, but the meaning would have\r\nbeen slightly different. With the perfect the sense is 'was so pleasant\r\nthat it _has_ wiped away'; with the imperfect 'was so pleasant that it\r\n_did_ (while I was writing) wipe away'. The metaphor in _absterserit_ is\r\ncommon: _e.g._ Tusc. 3, 43 _luctum omnem absterseris_. With this statement\r\nof Cicero's concerning the effect the work had on himself contrast Att. 14,\r\n21, 3 _legendus mihi saepius est Cato maior ad te missus. Amariorem enim me\r\nsenectus facit. Stomachor omnia_. -- OMNIS: acc. pl. A. 55, _c_; G. 60, 1;\r\nH. 67. -- EFFECERIT MOLLEM: so 56 _poteratne tantus animus efficere non\r\niucundam senectutem_; but 56 _conditiora facit haec aucupium_. _Efficio_\r\ngives more emphatically than _facio_ the idea of the completion of the\r\naction. Cf. Lael. 73 _efficere aliquem consulem_, 'to carry through a man's\r\nelection as consul'; _facere aliquem consulem_ being merely 'to vote for a\r\nman's election to the consulship'. -- SATIS DIGNE: 'as she deserves', lit.\r\n'in a sufficiently worthy manner.' Some editors have thought _digne_\r\nsuperfluous and wished to cast it out but we have _satis digne_ elsewhere,\r\nas in Verr. Act. II. 1, 82; cf. also Sex. Rosc. 33 _pro dignitate laudare\r\nsatis commode_. -- QUI PAREAT ... DEGERE: a conditional sentence of\r\nirregular form (_qui_ = _siquis_; _cui_ simply connective, = _et ei_). Cf.\r\nDiv. 1, 127 _qui enim teneat causas rerum futurarum, idem necesse est omnia\r\nteneat quae futura sint_; also the examples in Roby's Grammar, 1558. A.\r\n310, _a_, 307, _b_; G. 594, 1, 598; H. 507, II. and III. 2. Some, however,\r\nmake _possit_ a subjunctive of characteristic or of cause with _cui_, and\r\n_pareat_ a subjunctive by attraction. -- OMNE TEMPUS AETATIS: 'every season\r\nof life'; so in 55 _extremum tempus aetatis_; 70 _breve tempus aetatis._\r\nThe opposite phrase _aetas temporis_ is very rare; it occurs in Propertius\r\n1, 4, 7.\r\n\r\n3. CETERIS: neuter adjective used as a noun, equivalent to _ceteris rebus_\r\n'the other matters'; _i.e._ the political troubles hinted at above. The\r\nbest writers do not often use the neuter adjective as noun in the _oblique_\r\ncases unless there is something in the context to show the gender clearly,\r\nas in 24 _aliis ... eis quae_; we have, however, below in 8, _isto_ = _ista\r\nre_; 72, _reliquum_; 77, _caelestium_ = _rerum caelestium_; and in 78,\r\n_praeteritorum futurorumque_; see other instances in n. on Lael. 50\r\n_similium_. The proleptic or anticipatory use of _ceteris_ should also be\r\nnoticed; its sense is not fully seen till we come to _hunc librum_; the\r\nsame use occurs below in 4, 5, 59, 60; so _aliis_ in 24; cf. also n. on\r\nLael. 7 _reliqua_. -- DIXIMUS ... DICEMUS: when a clause or phrase consists\r\nof four parts, which go in pairs (as here _diximus_, _dicemus_ on one side,\r\nand _multa_, _saepe_ on the other), the Latins frequently arrange the words\r\nso as to put one pair between the two members of the other pair, as here.\r\nThis usage is called by grammarians _chiasmus_. Thus if we denote the four\r\nparts by _AA' BB', chiasmus_ requires the order _ABB'A'_ or _BAA'B'_. See\r\nexamples in 8, 20, 22, 38, 44, 71. For the more complicated forms of\r\nchiasmus consult Nägelsbach, Stil. §§ 167, 169. A. 344, _f_; G. 684; H.\r\n562. -- LIBRUM ... MISIMUS: observe the omission of a particle at the\r\nbeginning of the clause; the contrast between _ceteris_ and _hunc librum_\r\nis made stronger by the omission. For this _asyndeton adversativum_ see n.\r\non Lael. 5 _Laelium ... putes_. For tense of _misimus_, 'I send' see A.\r\n282; G. 244, H. 472, 1. -- OMNEM: see n. on 62. -- TRIBUIMUS: perfect tense\r\nlike _misimus_. -- TITHONO ... ARISTO: see Introd. -- CIUS: Greek Κειος (a\r\nnative of Ceos), not to be confused with Χιος (a native of Chios), or Κωος\r\n(a native of Cos). Cicero generally denotes the Greek diphthong ει by _i_\r\nnot e. This Aristo was a Peripatetic. -- PARUM ... AUCTORITATIS: observe\r\nhow often Cicero takes trouble to separate words which are, grammatically,\r\nclosely connected. So above, _omnis ... molestias_; 7 _multorum ...\r\nsenectutem_; 9 _mirificos ... fructus_; 21 _civium ... nomina_; 33 _minus\r\n... virium_; 53 _multo ... fecundior_; etc. etc. See also n. on 15 _quam\r\nsit iusta_. A. 344, _c_, _d_, _e_; H. 561, III. -- ESSET: condition\r\nomitted. A. 311; G. 602; H. 510. -- MAIOREM AUCTORITATEM: cf. Lael. 4. --\r\nAPUD QUEM: 'at whose house'; so 55 _a me_, 'from my house'. A. 153; G. 417;\r\nH. 446, n. 4. -- LAELIUM ... SCIPIONEM: see Introd. -- FACIMUS ADMIRANTIS:\r\n'we represent as expressing astonishment'. For _facere_, in this sense,\r\nCic. more often uses _inducere_ 'to bring on the stage', as in Lael. 4\r\n_Catonem induxi senem disputantem_. Cf. however 54 _Homerus Laerten\r\ncolentem agrum facit_; also Brut. 218; Orat. 85. Instead of _facimus_ we\r\nmight have expected either _fecimus_ to correspond with _misimus_ and\r\n_tribuimus_ above, or _faciemus_ to correspond with _videbitur_ below. On\r\nthe use of the participle see A. 292, _q_; G. 536; H 535, I. 4. --\r\nERUDITIUS DISPUTARE: Cic. not infrequently in his dialogues makes people\r\ntalk with more learning than they really possessed. He several times\r\nconfesses this as regards Lucullus and Catulus in the Academica, and as\r\nregards Antonius in the De Oratore. -- FERAT: subjunctive because embodying\r\nthe sentiment of Laelius and Scipio. Roby, 1744; Madvig, 357; H. 516, II.\r\n-- SUIS LIBRIS etc.: for the allusions here to Cato's life, works, and\r\nopinions see Introd. -- QUID OPUS EST PLURA? _sc. dicere_. cf. the elliptic\r\nphrases _quid multa? sc. dicam_ in 78; also below, 10 _praeclare_. A 206,\r\n_c_; H. 368, 3, n. 2.\r\n\r\n4. SAEPE NUMERO SOLEO: 'it is my frequent custom'. _Numero_ is literally\r\n'by the count or reckoning', and in _saepe numero_ had originally the same\r\nforce as in _quadraginta numero_ and the like; but the phrase came to be\r\nused merely as a slight strengthening of _saepe_. -- CUM HOC ... CUM\r\nCETERARUM: the use of _cum_ in different senses in the same clause, which\r\nseems awkward, is not uncommon; cf. below, 67. The spelling _quum_ was\r\ncertainly not used by Cicero, and probably by no other Latin writer of the\r\nbest period. H. 311, foot-note 4. It is worth remarking that _cum_ the\r\nconjunction and _cum_ the preposition, though spelt alike, are by origin\r\nquite distinct. The former is derived from the pronominal stem _ka_ or\r\n_kva_, and is cognate with _qui_; the latter comes from the root _sak_ 'to\r\nfollow', and is cognate with Gk. συν, Lat _sequor_, etc. See Vanicek,\r\nEtymologisches Worterbuch, pp. 96, 984. -- RERUM ... SAPIENTIAM: 'wisdom\r\n_in_ affairs'; the objective genitive -- EXCELLENTEM: in sense much\r\nstronger than our 'excellent'; _excellentem perfectamque_ 'pre-eminent and\r\nindeed faultless'. -- QUOD ... SENSERIM: this clause takes the place of an\r\nobject to _admirari_. The subjunctive is used because the speaker reports\r\nhis own reason for the wonder, formerly felt, as if according to the views\r\nof another person, and without affirming his holding the same view at the\r\ntime of speaking. Madvig, 357, _a_, Obs. 1. A 341, _d_, Rem. -- ODIOSA:\r\nthis word is not so strong as our 'hateful', but rather means 'wearisome',\r\n'annoying'. In Plautus the frequent expression _odiosus es_ means, in\r\ncolloquial English, 'you bore me'. Cf. 47 _odiosum et molestum_; 65 _odiosa\r\noffensio_. -- ONUS AETNA GRAVIUS: a proverbial expression with an allusion\r\nto Enceladus, who, after the defeat of the Giants by Juppiter, was said to\r\nhave been imprisoned under Mt. Aetna. Cf. Eurip. Hercules Furens, 637; also\r\nLongfellow's poem, Enceladus. -- HAUD SANE DIFFICILEM: 'surely far from\r\ndifficult'; cf. 83 _haud sane facile_. -- QUIBUS: a _dativus commodi_,\r\n'those for whom there is no aid in themselves'. Cf. Lael. 79 _quibus in\r\nipsis_. -- BENE BEATEQUE VIVENDUM: 'a virtuous and happy life'; 'virtue and\r\nhappiness'; so _bene honesteque_ below, 70. -- QUI ... PETUNT: these are\r\nthe αυταρκεις, men sufficient for themselves, '_in se toti teretes atque\r\nrotundi_'. We have here a reminiscence of the Stoic doctrine about the wise\r\nman, whose happiness is quite independent of everything outside himself,\r\nand is caused solely by his own virtue. Cicero represents the same Stoic\r\ntheory in Lael. 7. Cf. Juv. Sat. 10, 357-362; also Seneca, De Cons. Sap.\r\nVIII, De Prov. I. 5. -- A SE IPSI: 'themselves from themselves,' so in 78\r\n_se ipse moveat ... se ipse relucturus sit_; 84 _me ipse consolabar_.\r\nExpressions like _a se ipsis_ are quite uncommon in Cicero. Cf. n. on Lael.\r\n5 _te ipse cognosces_; also see below, 38 _se ipsa_ 78 _se ipse_. --\r\nNATURAE NECESSITAS: 'the inevitable conditions of nature.' Cf. 71 _quid est\r\ntam secundum naturam quam senibus emori?_ -- AFFERAT: subjunctive because\r\n_nihil quod_ = _nihil tale ut_. A 320, _a_; G. 633, 634; H. 503, I. -- QUO\r\nIN GENERE: _sc. rerum_; with this phrase the defining genitive is commonly\r\nomitted by Cicero. So below, 45 _in eo genere_. -- UT ... ADEPTAM: notice\r\nthe chiasmus. -- EANDEM: _idem_ is used in the same way, to mark an\r\nemphatic contrast in 24, 52, 68, 71. -- ADEPTAM: this is probably the only\r\nexample in Cicero of the passive use of _adeptus_, which occurs in Sallust,\r\nOvid, Tacitus, etc.; and in this passage the use cannot be looked on as\r\ncertain, since one of the very best and several of the inferior MSS. read\r\n_adepti_. Cicero, however, uses a good many deponent participles in a\r\npassive sense (cf. below, 59 _dimensa_; 74 _meditatum_; see also a list,\r\nRoby, 734), and some of them occur very rarely. Thus _periclitatus,\r\narbitratus, depastus_ as passives are found each in only one passage. --\r\nINCONSTANTIA: 'instability', 'inconsistency'. _Constantia_, unwavering\r\nfirmness and consistency, is the characteristic of the wise man; cf. Acad.\r\n2, 23 _sapientia ... quae ex sese habeat constantiam_; also Lael. 8 and 64.\r\n\r\nP. 3. -- AIUNT: _sc. stulti_. -- PUTASSENT: the subjunctive is due to the\r\nindirect discourse. Where we say 'I should not have thought,' the Latins\r\nsay, in direct narration, '_non putaram_,' _i.e._ 'I never had thought' (so\r\nOff. 1, 81 and often in Cicero's letters). Translate, 'more quickly than\r\nthey had ever expected'. Cf. Att. 6, 1, 6 _accipiam equidem dolorem mihi\r\nilium irasci sed multo maiorem non esse eum talem qualem putassem_. See\r\nZumpt, Gram., 518. -- FALSUM PUTARE: 'to form a mistaken judgment'. For\r\n_falsum_ as noun equivalent to ψευδος, cf. 6 _gratissimum_; also n. on 3\r\n_ceteris_. -- QUI CITIUS: lit. 'in what way quicker'; cf. Tusc. 5, 89 _qui\r\nmelius_. H. 188, II. 2. -- ADULESCENTIA ... SENECTUS ... PUERITIA: babyhood\r\nwas generally at Rome supposed to last till the 17th year (the time for\r\nassuming the _toga virilis_ and for beginning military service). _Iuventus_\r\nis usually the age from 17 to 45, during which men were liable to be called\r\non for active service. Ordinarily, in colloquial language, _adulescentia_\r\nis the earlier portion of _iuventus_, say the years from 17 to 30 (cf. 33),\r\nbut Cicero seems here to make _adulescentia_ co-extensive with _iuventus_.\r\nFrom 45 to 60 is the _aetas seniorum_, the period during which citizens in\r\nearly Rome might be called out for the defence of the city, but not for\r\nactive service. _Senectus_ was commonly reckoned as beginning at 60; but in\r\n§ 60 Cicero includes in _senectus_ the _aetas seniorum_, and probably\r\nintended to include it here. In Tusc. 1, 34 Cic. reckons three ages\r\n_pueritia adulescentia senectus_ as here; below in 74, four periods, or\r\nfive. -- QUAMVIS: = _quantumvis_. -- EFFLUXISSET: subjunctive because the\r\nmood of _posset_, to which it stands in subordinate relation _Cum_ here is\r\npurely temporal. See Roby, 1778; A. 342; G. 666; H. 529, II. -- POSSET: see\r\nn. on _esset_ above, 3.\r\n\r\n5. SI ... SOLETIS ... SUMUS: the apodosis and protasis do not exactly\r\ncorrespond; the sense really required is 'if that wisdom for which you\r\nadmire me does exist, it lies in this', etc. -- UTINAM ... ESSET: _esset_\r\nhere gives a greater appearance of modesty than would been expressed by\r\n_sit_: 'would it were, as it certainly is not'. A. 267; G. 253; H. 483, 2.\r\n-- COGNOMINE: Cato bore the title _sapiens_, even in his lifetime; see\r\nIntrod. _Cognomen_ is used in good Latin to denote both the family name and\r\nthe acquired by-name; in late Latin this latter is denoted by _agnomen_. --\r\nIN HOC SAPIENTES: but above, 4 _rerum sapientiam_, not _in rebus_. The\r\ngenitive construction is not found with _sapiens_ used as noun or adjective\r\ntill late Latin times. -- NATURAM DUCEM etc.: Cato's claim to the title of\r\n_sapiens_ does not rest on any deep knowledge of philosophy, but on\r\npractical wisdom or common sense and experience in affairs. Cf. Lael. 6 and\r\n19. In this passage Cicero has put into Cato's mouth phrases borrowed from\r\nthe Stoic philosophy, which declared the life of virtue to be life in\r\naccordance with nature (_naturae convenienter vivere_ or ‛ομολογουμενως τη\r\nφυσει ζην). Cf. 71, n. on _secundum naturam_. -- TAMQUAM DEUM: observe\r\n_deum_ not _deam_, because nature is compared with, and not identified\r\nwith, a divine being. Cf. Fin. 5, 43 _eam (rationem) quasi deum ducem\r\nsubsequens_. -- AETATIS: here = _vitae_, life as a whole. Cf. 2 _omne\r\ntempus aetatis_ and n.; also 13 _aetatis ... senectus_; 33, 64, 82. --\r\nDESCRIPTAE: 'composed'; literally 'written out'. The reading _discriptae_,\r\nwhich many editions give, does not so well suit the passage. _Discribere_\r\nis to map out, plan, arrange, put in order (see 59 _discripta_ and\r\n_discriptio_); the point here lies, however, not in the due arrangement of\r\nthe different scenes of a play, but in the careful working out of each\r\nscene. _Ab ea_ must be supplied after _descriptae_ from _a qua_ above. --\r\nACTUM: the common comparison of life with a drama is also found in 64, 70,\r\n85. -- INERTI: the sense of 'ignorant' 'inartistic' (_in, ars_), has been\r\ngiven to this by some editors (cf. Hor. Ep. 2, 2, 126 _praetulerim scriptor\r\ndelirus inersque videri_, and Cic. Fin. 2, 115 _artes, quibus qui carebant,\r\ninertes a maioribus nominabantur_), but the meaning 'inactive', 'lazy',\r\n'slovenly' seems to suit _neglectum_ better. -- POETA: nature is here the\r\ndramatist, the drama is life, the actors are human beings. -- SED TAMEN\r\netc.: 'but for all that it was inevitable that there should be something\r\nwith the nature of an end'. So 69 _in quo est aliquid extremum_, 43\r\n_aliquid pulchrum_. -- ARBORUM BACIS: the word _baca_ (the spelling _bacca_\r\nhas little or no authority) is applied to all fruits growing on bushes or\r\ntrees, cf. Tusc. 1, 31 _arbores seret diligens agricola, quarum aspiciet\r\nbacam ipse numquam_ -- TERRAEQUE FRUCTIBUS: here = cereals, roots,\r\nvegetables and small fruits. No sharp distinction can be drawn between\r\n_fruges_ and _fructus_ (_e.g._ in Div. 1, 116 we have _fruges terrae\r\nbacasve arborum_) though _fructus_ as commonly used is the more general\r\nword of the two. -- MATURITATE CADUCUM: 'a time of senility, so to speak\r\nand readiness to drop, that comes of a seasonable ripeness'. _Vietus_ is\r\nliterally 'twisted' or bent', being originally the passive participle of\r\n_viere_. The comparison of old age with the ripeness of fruit recurs in 71.\r\nCf. Plin. Ep. 5, 14, 5 _non tam aetatis maturitate quam vitae_. --\r\nFERUNDUM: the form in _undus_ is archaic, and generally used by Cic. in\r\nquoting or imitating passages of laws, sacred formulae, and the like. H.\r\n239. -- MOLLITER: here 'gently', 'with resignation', though _molliter\r\nferre_ often has another meaning, viz. to bear pain or trouble in an\r\n_unmanly_ fashion. Cf. _facillime ferre_ below. -- QUID EST ALIUD etc. The\r\nwords perhaps imply the rationalistic explanation of myths which the Greeks\r\nhad begun to teach to the Romans during Cato's lifetime. Trans 'what else\r\nbut resistance to nature is equivalent to warring against the gods, and\r\n_not_ 'what else does warring with the gods mean but to resist nature.' In\r\ncomparisons of this sort the Latins generally put the things compared in a\r\ndifferent order from that required by English idiom. Thus in Div. 2, 78\r\n_quid est aliud nolle moneri a Iove nisi efficere ut aut ne fieri possit\r\nauspicium aut, si fiat, videri_, S. Rosc. 54 _quid est aliud iudicio ac\r\nlegibus ac maiestate vestra abuti ad quaestum ac libidinem nisi hoc modo\r\naccusare_. Phil. 1, 22, 2, 7, 5, 5, 10, 5. -- GIGANTUM MODO: see n. on 4\r\n_Aetna gravius_ -- DIS: for the form _dis_ see n. on 25.\r\n\r\n6. ATQUI: in the best Latin _atqui_ does not introduce a statement\r\n_contradicting_ the preceding statement, but one that _supplements_ it.\r\nHere it may be translated 'True, but'. Cf. 66, 81. -- GRATISSIMUM:\r\nequivalent to _rem gratissimam_. With the thought cf. Rep. 1, 34 _gratum\r\nfeceris si explicaris_. Lael. 16 _pergratum feceris si disputaris_ -- UT\r\nPOLLICEAR: so Acad. 1, 33 _nos vero volumus ut pro Attico respondeam_.\r\nBrut. 122 _nobis vero placet, ut pro Bruto etiam respondeam_; Lael. 32 _tu\r\nvero perge, pro hoc enim respondeo_ A 317, _c_, H 499, 2, n. -- SENES\r\nFIERI: if the infinitive had depended on _speramus_ alone and _volumus_ had\r\nnot intervened, Cicero would probably have written _nos futuros esse\r\nsenes_. -- MULTO ANTE: _sc. quam id factum erit_ so Balb. 41 _re denique\r\nmulto ante (sc. quam factum est) audita_, and very often in Cicero. --\r\nDIDICERIMUS: as this corresponds with _feceris,_it would have been formally\r\ncorrect to write here _nos docueris_ -- QUIBUS POSSIMUS: 'what\r\nconsiderations will enable us most easily to support the growing burden of\r\nage'. -- FUTURUM EST: = μελλει ειναι this form of the future is used in\r\npreference to the simple _erit_ because it is desired to represent the\r\nevent as _on the very point of fulfilment_, and therefore sure of\r\nfulfilment. _Erit_ would have implied much less certainty. Trans. 'I will\r\ndo so if my action _is going to give_ you pleasure' Cf. 67 _beatus futurus\r\nsum_, also 81, 85. See Roby, 1494. -- NISI MOLESTUM EST:3 a common\r\nexpression of courtesy, like 15 _nisi alienum putas, si placet_, cf. Hor.\r\nSat. 2, 8, 4 _si grave non est_. -- TAMQUAM LONGAM VIAM: Cicero here puts\r\ninto Laelius' mouth almost the very words addressed by Socrates to the aged\r\nCephalus in the introduction to Plato's Republic, 328 E. Observe the\r\nsuccession of similar sounds in t_am_qu_am_, aliqu_am_, long_am_, vi_am_.\r\n-- VIAM CONFECERIS: so pro Quint. 79 _conficere DCC milia passuum,\r\nconficere iter_ a common phrase. For mood see A 312, G 604, H 513, II. --\r\nQUAM ... INGREDIUNDUM SIT: this construction, the neuter of the gerundive\r\nwith _est_ followed by an accusative case, is exceedingly rare excepting in\r\ntwo writers, Lucretius and Varro. See the full list of examples given by\r\nRoby, Gram., Pref. to vol. 2, p. LXXII. A 294, _c_, H 371, I. 2, 2, n. The\r\nbest texts of Cicero now give only one example of a construction at all\r\nresembling this, viz. pro Scauro 13 _obliviscendum vobis putatis matrum in\r\nliberos, virorum in uxores scelera?_ The supposition of some scholars, that\r\nin this passage Cic. used the construction in imitation of the archaic\r\nstyle of Cato, is not likely to be true, seeing that in Cato's extant works\r\nthe construction does not once occur. For the form _undum_ see n. on 5\r\n_ferundum_. -- ISTUC not adverb, but neuter pronoun, as in 8. The kind of\r\nconstruction, _istuc videre quale sit_ for _videre quale istuc sit_, is\r\nespecially common in Cicero.\r\n\r\n7. FACIAM UT POTERO: 'I will do it as well as I can.' Observe the future\r\n_potero_ where English idiom would require a present. So Rep. 1, 38 _hic\r\nScipio, faciam quod voltis, ut potero_. -- SAEPE ENIM: _enim_ introduces a\r\nreason, not for the words _ut potero_, but for _faciam_ -- 'I will grant\r\nyour request because I have often heard complaints about old age and\r\ntherefore have thought of the matter'. -- PARES AUTEM etc.: parenthetical.\r\n-- VETERE PROVERBIO: the saying is as old as Homer, Od. 17, 218 as ‛ως αιει\r\nτον ‛ομοιον αγει θεος ‛ως τον ‛ομοιον; cf. also Plat., Rep. 329 A, Symp.\r\n195 B, Phaedr. 240 C.\r\n\r\nP. 4. -- FACILLIME: 'most cheerfully', 'most eagerly'; a common meaning of\r\nthe word in Cic., _e.g._ Fam. 2, 16, 2 _in maritimis facillime sum_, _i.e._\r\n'I find most pleasure in staying by the sea'. -- QUAE: a kind of\r\nexplanation of _querellis_: -- 'lamentations, viz. such utterances as'\r\netc.; see n. on Lael. 14 _quae_; cf. Fam. 2, 8, 2 _sermonibus de re publica\r\n... quae nec possunt scribi nec scribenda sunt_. A. 199, _b_; G. 616, 3,\r\nI.; H. 445, 5. -- C. SALINATOR: probably C. Livius Salinator, praetor in\r\n191 B.C. (Livy 35, 24), who was entrusted with the equipment of the Roman\r\nfleets during the war against Antiochus. He was born about 230, and was\r\ntherefore a little younger than Cato; cf. _fere aequales_ below. Salinator\r\nwas consul in 188, and died in 170. For the name Salinator cf. n. on 11. --\r\nSP. ALBINUS: Sp. Postumius Albinus was consul in 186, and was with his\r\ncolleague appointed to investigate the great Bacchanalian conspiracy of\r\nthat year (Livy 39, CC. 1 seq.). Albinus died in 180. He was probably a\r\nlittle younger than Salinator. He can scarcely have been fifty years of age\r\nat his death. -- TUM ... TUM: 'now ... again'; so in 45. -- CARERENT: see\r\nn. on 3 _ferat_. -- VITAM NULLAM PUTARENT: 'they considered life to be not\r\nlife at all'. For _vitam nullam_ cf. Lael. 86 _sine amicitia vitam esse\r\nnullam_; also the Greek phrase βιος αβιωτος; and below, 77 _vitam quae est\r\nsola vita nominanda_; also 82. A. 239; H. 373, 1, n. 2. _Putarent_ =\r\n'thought, as they said'. -- ID QUOD ESSET ACCUSANDUM: the subjunctive\r\n_esset_ is used because a _class_ of things is referred to, 'nothing of a\r\nnature to deserve complaint'; _id quod erat_, etc. would have meant merely\r\n'that one thing which was matter for complaint'. A. 320; G. 634, Rem. 1; H.\r\n503, I. -- USU VENIRENT: the phrase _usu venire_ differs very little in\r\nmeaning from _accidere_. _Usu_ is commonly explained as an ablative ('in\r\npractice', 'in experience'), but is quite as likely to be a dative of the\r\nsort generally called predicative ('to come as matter of experience'); cf.\r\nVerg. Aen. 1, 22 _venire excidio_; Plin. N.H. 28, 106 _odio_; Caes. B.G. 5,\r\n27 _subsidio_. -- QUORUM ... MULTORUM: the first genitive is dependent on\r\nthe second, so that _quorum = e quibus_. Notice the separation of _quorum_\r\nfrom _multorum_ and of _multorum_ from _senectutem_. -- SINE QUERELLA:\r\nattribute of _senectutem_. A. 217, Rem.; H. 359, n. 1, 4), and n. 3. This\r\nform of attributive phrase, consisting of a preposition with a noun, is\r\ncommon; cf. 24 _ex agro Sabino rusticos Romanos_; 40 _cum hostibus\r\nclandestina colloquia_. _Querella_ is better spelling than _querela_. See\r\nRoby, 177, 2. -- QUI: 'men of such nature as to ...'. -- ET ... NEC: Roby\r\n2241. The reason for the departure from the ordinary sequence of particles\r\nlies in the words _non moleste_. _Nec ...et _ is common; see 51, 53. --\r\nLIBIDINUM VINCULIS etc.: Cic. is here thinking of the conversation between\r\nSocrates and Cephalus in Plato, Rep. 329 D, for which see Introd. --\r\nMODERATI: 'self-controlled'; cf. n. on 1 _moderationem_; _difficiles_,\r\n'peevish'; _inhumani_, 'unkindly'; _importunitas_, 'perversity'.\r\n_Importunitas_ seems to be used as the substantive corresponding in sense\r\nwith the adjective _difficilis_. _Difficultas_, in the sense of\r\n'peevishness', probably occurs only in Mur. 19.\r\n\r\n8. DIXERIT QUISPIAM: 'some one will say presently'; a gentle way of\r\nintroducing one's own objection. The mood of _dixerit_ is probably\r\nindicative, not subjunctive; see the thorough discussion in Roby, Gram.,\r\nVol. 2, Pref., p. CIV. _et seq_. -- OPES ET COPIAS: 'resources and means'.\r\n_Opes_ has a wider meaning than _copias_ (mere material wealth) and\r\nincludes all sources of power, influence, and authority as well as wealth.\r\nThus in Lael. 22 the end of _divitiae_ is said to be enjoyment; of _opes_,\r\nworship (_opes ut colare_). _Dignitas_ is social position. -- ID: remark\r\nthe singular pronoun, which indicates that the preceding clause is now\r\ntaken as conveying one idea. Trans. 'such fortune'. -- CONTINGERE: 'to fall\r\nto one's lot' is the phrase in English which most closely represents\r\n_contingere_. This verb is not, as is often assumed, used merely of _good_\r\nfortune; it implies in itself nothing concerning the _character_ of events,\r\nwhether they be good or bad, but simply that the events take place\r\n_naturally_ and were to be expected. See n. on Lael. 8, where the word is\r\ndistinctly used in connection with _bad_ fortune, as it is, strikingly, in\r\n71 below. -- EST ... OMNIA: 'your statement indeed amounts to something,\r\nbut it by no means comprises every consideration'. The phrase _esse\r\naliquid_, 'to be of some importance', is often used by Cic. both of things\r\nand of persons; cf. Tusc. 5, 104 _eos aliquid esse_, also n. on 17 _nihil\r\nafferunt_. So _esse aliquis_ of persons, as in the well-known passage of\r\nIuvenal, 1, 72 _aude aliquid brevibus Gyaris et carcere dignum si vis esse\r\naliquis_. For the general sense cf. Tusc. 3, 52 _est id quidem magnum, sed\r\nnon sunt in hoc omnia_; so De Or. 2, 215; ib. 3, 221; Leg. 2, 24 _in quo\r\nsunt omnia_. -- ISTO: the use of the neuter pronoun in the oblique case as\r\nsubstantive is noticeable. -- THEMISTOCLES ETC.: Cicero borrows the story\r\nfrom Plato (Rep. 329 E _et seq_.), but it was first told by Herodotus, 8,\r\n125 who gave a somewhat different version. Themistocles had received great\r\nhonors at Sparta when Athenian ambassador there; an envious man declaring\r\nthat the honors were paid really to Athens and not to Themistocles, the\r\nstatesman answered ουτ αν εγω, εων Βελβινιτης (_i.e._ an inhabitant of the\r\nsmall island of Belbina lying to the S. of Cape Sunium) ετιμηθην ουτω προς\r\nΣπαρτιηρεων, ουτ αν συ, ανθρωπε, εων Αθηναιος. -- SERIPHIO: Seriphus is a\r\nsmall island belonging to the Cyclad group and lying almost due N. of\r\nMelos, and due E. of the Scyllaean promontory. Seriphus is often taken by\r\nancient writers as a specimen of an insignificant community (_e.g._\r\nAristoph. Acharn. 542; Cic. N.D. 1, 88), but it had the honor of being one\r\nof the three island states which refused to give earth and water to the\r\nPersian envoys, the other two being the adjacent islands of Melos and\r\nSiphnus (Herodotus, 8, 46). -- IURGIO: _iurgium_ is a quarrel which does\r\nnot go beyond words; _rixa_ a quarrel where the disputants come to blows.\r\n-- SI EGO: but further on, _tu si_. The contrast would certainly be more\r\nperfect if _ego si_ were read, as has been proposed, in place of _si ego_.\r\n-- QUOD EODEM MODO ... DICI: Cic. commonly says _quod ita dicendum_ and the\r\nlike; see n. on 35 _quod ni ita fuisset_. Cato means that just as\r\nThemistocles' success was due to two things, his own character and his good\r\nfortune, so two things are necessary to make old age endurable, viz.\r\nmoderate fortune and wisdom. He then in 9 insists that of these two\r\nconditions wisdom is far the more important. -- NEC ... LEVIS ... NEC ...\r\nNON GRAVIS: notice the chiasmus.\r\n\r\n9. OMNINO: here = πανταπασι 'undoubtedly', in a strongly affirmative sense,\r\nas in 76; but in 28 (where see n.) it is concessive. -- CUM DIU MULTUMQUE\r\nVIXERIS: literally 'when you have lived long and much', _i.e._ when you\r\nhave not only had a long life but have done a great deal in the course of\r\nit. The phrases _diu multumque, multum et diu_ are common in Cic., as\r\nbelow, 38; Acad. 1, 4; Div. 2, 1; Off 1, 118; Leg. Agr. 2, 88; De Or. 1,\r\n152. For mood see A. 309, a; H. 518, 2. -- ECFERUNT: _ecferunt_ for\r\n_efferunt_ (_ec_ = _ex_ = _ecs_; so εκ = εξ = εκς) was old-fashioned in\r\nCicero's time, but forms of the sort, as below, 39 _ecfrenate_, according\r\nto the evidence of the best MSS., occur in a good many passages. See Neue,\r\nFormenlehre, Vol. 2, pp. 766 seq., ed. 2. -- NUMQUAM DESERUNT: the omission\r\nof the object after _deserunt_ is not common. With the general sense of\r\nthis passage cf. Arch. 16 _litterarum studia adulescentiam alunt,\r\nsenectutem oblectant, secundas res ornant, adversis perfugium ac solarium\r\npraebent, delectant domi, non impediunt foris, pernoctant nobiscum,\r\nperegrinantur, rusticantur._\r\n\r\nP. 5. -- 10. Q. MAXIMUM: the famous Q. Fabius Maximus Verrucosus Ovicula\r\nCunctator, hero of the Second Punic War. -- EUM ... RECEPIT: this clause\r\nhas often been suspected to be an insertion of the writers of MSS. But (1)\r\nthe capture of Tarentum in 209 B.C. was Fabius' crowning achievement, and\r\n'captor of Tarentum' was often added to his name as a title of honor; see\r\nDe Orat. 2, 273; and (2) there were several other persons of distinction\r\nbearing the name Q. Maximus about the same time, so that some special mark\r\nwas wanted for the sake of clearness. Notice _recepit_ 'recovered',\r\nTarentum having been lost by the Romans to Hannibal in 212 B.C. -- SENEM\r\nADULESCENS: observe the emphasis given by placing close together the two\r\nwords of opposite meaning. -- ERAT ... GRAVITAS: 'that hero possessed\r\ndignity tempered by courtesy'. Expressions like _erat in illo gravitas_ are\r\ncommon in Cicero; _e.g._ Mur. 58 _erat in Cotta summa eloquentia._ The\r\nmetaphor in _condīta_, 'seasoned', is also common; cf. Lael. 66\r\n_condimentum amicitiae_. -- QUAMQUAM: 'though indeed', introducing a\r\nnecessary correction of the last words _nec senectus mores mutaverat._ For\r\nthis corrective _quamquam_ cf. n. on 2. -- CONSUL PRIMUM: B.C. 233. --\r\nGRANDEM NATU: although the phrases _maior, maximus, parvus, minor, minimus\r\nnatu_ are of frequent occurrence, yet _magnus natu_ is not Latin, _grandis\r\nnatu_ being always used instead. The historians sometimes use _magno natu\r\nesse_ or _in magno natu esse_. -- ANNO POST: the word _unus_ is not usually\r\nattached to _annus_ except where there is a strong contrast between one and\r\na larger number of years. _Anno post_ must not be translated 'during the\r\nyear after'; but either 'a year after', _anno_ being regarded as the\r\nablative of measure or excess, literally 'later by a year', or 'at the end\r\nof a year', the ablative being one of limitation, and _fuerat_ being\r\nequivalent to _factus erat_ 'had been elected'. So _quinto anno_ below, 'at\r\nthe end of the fifth year', _i.e._ 'five years after'. -- ADULESCENTULUS\r\nMILES: See n. on 21 _quemquam senem._ Translate 'when quite a youth I\r\nmarched with him to Capua as a private soldier'. G. 324; H. 363, 3, 2).\r\n_Miles_ here = _gregarius miles_. -- QUEM MAGISTRATUM: _sc. quaesturam_, to\r\nbe understood from _quaestor_ Cf. Mur. 18 _quaesturam una petiit et sum ego\r\nfactus (sc. quaestor) prior_. -- TUDITANO ET CETHEGO: when the _praenomina_\r\nof the consuls are given the names generally stand side by side without\r\n_et_; when they are omitted _et_ is generally inserted. Cf. n. on 50\r\n_Centone Tuditanoque_, etc. -- CUM QUIDEM: the _quidem_ simply adds a\r\nslight emphasis to _cum_; 'at the very time when', επειδη γε. -- SUASOR:\r\n_suasor legis_ was any person who publicly (_i.e._ before the senate or\r\npeople in _contio_ assembled) spoke in favor of a measure, _dissuasor_ any\r\none who spoke against it. Cf. 14 _suasissem_. -- LEGIS CINCIAE: a law\r\npassed in 204 B.C. by M. Cincius Alimentus, a plebeian tribune, whereby\r\nadvocates were forbidden to take fees from their clients, and certain\r\nlimitations were placed on gifts of property by private persons. -- CUM ...\r\nESSET: '_though_ he was'; so below 11, 30, etc. -- GRANDIS: = _grandis\r\nnatu_. -- IUVENILITER: Hannibal was 29 years of age when he entered Italy\r\nin 218. -- EXSULTANTEM: 'wildly roaming'. The word in its literal sense is\r\nused of a horse galloping at its own will over a plain. The metaphorical\r\nuse is common in Cicero; cf. Acad. 2, 112 _cum sit campus in quo exsultare\r\npossit oratio, cur eam tantas in angustias compellimus?_ -- PATIENTIA:\r\n'endurance', 'persistence'; it is not equivalent to our 'patience'. --\r\nPRAECLARE: _sc. dicit_; cf. n. on 3. -- FAMILIARIS: see Introd. -- UNUS\r\nHOMO etc.: these lines were famous, and were not only often quoted with the\r\nname of Ennius attached (as in Off. 1, 84; Livy 30, 26), but also imitated\r\nor adapted without mention of his name, as, being too familiar to need it;\r\ncf. Att. 2, 19, 2; Ovid, Fast. 2, 241; Verg. Aen. 6, 846; Suet. Tib. 21. --\r\nCUNCTANDO: Cf. Polybius 3, 105, 8. On Fabius' military policy consult\r\nMommsen, Hist. of Rome, Bk. III. ch. 5. -- REM: here = _rem publicam_. --\r\nNOENUM: the older form from which _non_ is an abbreviation; = _ne-oinom_,\r\n_n-oinom_, literally 'not one thing'; cf. _nihil_ = _ne-hilum_ 'not a\r\nwhit', also the rare word _ningulus_ = _ne oinculus_, 'not even a little\r\none'. -- RUMORES: 'fame', 'public opinion'. -- PONEB[=A]T: for the long\r\nvowel cf. n. on 1, l. 2 _versat_. -- PLUSQUE: MSS. _postque_; _plusque_is\r\nthe emendation of Bernays. _Plusque magisque_ is a variation upon the\r\nordinary phrases _plus plusque_, _magis magisque_.\r\n\r\n11. SALINATORI: there can be no doubt that Cicero is guilty of a blunder\r\nhere, and in De Or. 2, 273 where the story also occurs. Livy (27, 34, 7)\r\ngives M. Livius Macatus as the name of the Roman commander who held the\r\ncitadel of Tarentum while Hannibal was in possession of the town. Cicero\r\nprobably found the commander described by the annalists merely as M. Livius\r\n(so in Livy 24, 20, 13; 26, 39, 1), and then jumped to tne conclusion that\r\nhe was the famous M. Livius Salinator. This man, the father of the\r\nSalinator mentioned in 7, was consul in 219 and subdued the Illyrians, but\r\nwas condemned for misappropriation of public moneys and went into exile. In\r\n210 he was induced to return by the desire of the senate. In 207 he became\r\nconsul with C. Claudius Nero, and defeated Hasdrubal in the great battle of\r\nthe Metaurus. In 204 Livius was censor with Nero as his colleague, and won\r\nhis name _Salinator_ by imposing a tax on salt. The title was bestowed in\r\nridicule, but clung to the family. Salinator was a relative of M. Livius\r\nMacatus. See Liv 27, 34, 7. -- ITA DICENTI etc.: the anecdote is told by\r\nLivy, 27, 25, 5 and Plutarch, Fab. 23. Both, however, refer the story not\r\nto the time at which Tarentum was taken, but to the year after, when\r\naltercations about it took place in the senate. -- TOGA: here put for\r\n'civil life', the _toga_ being replaced in time of war by the _sagum_. Cf.\r\nin Pisonem 73 _pacis est insigne et oti toga, contra autem arma tumultus\r\natque belli;_ De Or. 3, 167 _'togam', pro 'pace', 'arma', ac 'tela', pro\r\n'bello'._ We have the same contrast between _arma_ and _toga_ in Cicero's\r\nown much-derided verse, _cedant arma togae, concedat laurea laudi_, which\r\nis defended by him, in Pis. 73 and Off. 1, 77. -- CONSUL ITERUM etc.: as\r\nthe second consulship of Fabius was in 228 B.C., while the law of Flaminius\r\nwas passed in 232 (according to Polybius), it is very difficult to\r\nunderstand the statement here made. It is possible that Flaminius was one\r\nof the commissioners for executing his own law, and that its execution\r\nlasted over the time of Fabius' second consulship. The Flaminius here\r\nmentioned is the same who fell as consul in 217 at the battle of lake\r\nTrasimenus. He held large and statesman-like views on the policy of\r\nsecuring Italy by planting Romans and Latins in the territory then recently\r\ntaken from the Gauls, in the neighborhood of Ariminum. This particular\r\nmeasure was carried against the will of the senate, and was the first law\r\npassed, since the _lex Hortensia_ of 287, in defiance of its wishes. It was\r\nalso the first agrarian law since the Licinio-Sextian law of 367. Polybius\r\ndates the decline of the Roman constitution from the passing of the _lex\r\nFlaminia_. Cf.'Rheinisches Museum', 1843, p. 573. -- SP. CARVILIO\r\nQUIESCENTE: this Sp. Carvilius was consul in 234 when he conquered the\r\nCorsicans and Sardinians. In 228 he was again consul, and died as augur in\r\n212. He is said, but erroneously, to have been the first Roman who divorced\r\nhis wife. In 216, just after the battle of Cannae, he made a most\r\nremarkable proposal, to fill up the gaps which that battle had made in the\r\nnumbers of the senate by selecting two members from each of the Latin\r\ncommunities. It was almost the only occasion in the course of Roman history\r\nwhen anything like modern representative government was advocated.\r\nCarvilius was not sprung from one of the noble families, who for the most\r\npart monopolized the higher offices of state, it is therefore not\r\nsurprising that he should have sympathized with Flaminius. -- CONTRA\r\nSENATUS AUCTORITATEM: 'against the expressed wish of the senate' _Senatus\r\nauctoritas_ is, strictly speaking, an opinion of the senate not formally\r\nembodied in a decree, _senatus consultum_. Cicero, in Invent. 2, 52 says\r\nFlaminius carried his law _contra voluntatem omnium optimatium_. --\r\nDIVIDENTI: 'when he tried to divide'. The participle is here equivalent to\r\n_cum_ with the imperfect indicative (dividebat). So in 54 _lenientem_ A.\r\n290, _a_; G 668; H 549, 1.\r\n\r\nP. 6. -- CUM ESSET: '_though_ he was'. What Fabius declared was reaily that\r\nthe _auspicia_ were a political instrument in the hands of the aristocrats,\r\nrather than a part of religion. Fabius, according to Liv. 30, 26, 7, was\r\naugur for 62 years before his death, and had no doubt had a large\r\nexperience in the manipulation of the _auspicia_ for political purposes.\r\nCompare Homer, Iliad, 12, 243, also Cic. Phil. 11, 28 _Iuppiter ipse sanxit\r\nut omnia quae rei publicae salutaria essent legitima et iusta haberentur_.\r\nConsult Mommsen, Hist of Rome, Bk. IV. Ch. 12.\r\n\r\n12. ADMIRABILIUS: 'more amazing'. The Latin word has a much stronger\r\nmeaning than the English word derived from it. -- QUO MODO TULIT: = _eum\r\nmodum quo tulit_, so that the clause is not really dependent on _cognovi_,\r\nnor _tulit_ irregularly put for _tulerit_. In Lael. 9 Laelius exclaims, of\r\nCato himself, _quo modo, ut alia omittam, mortem fili tulit_. And no doubt\r\nCic. meant here to make Cato allude to _his_ loss, described in 84. --\r\nFILI: see n. on 1 _praemi_. -- CONSULARIS: the son of Fabius was consul in\r\n213 with Ti. Sempronius Gracchus -- EST IN MANIBUS: 'is in every one's\r\nhands', 'is commonly read'. The expression is common enough in this sense;\r\n_e.g._ Lael. 96 _in manibus est oratio_. -- LAUDATIO: _sc. funebris_, the\r\nfuneral speech. This composition was read in Cicero's time (see Tusc. 3,\r\n70; Fam. 4, 6, 1) and existed in the time of Plutarch. See Plutarch's life\r\nof Fab. 24. -- QUEM PHILOSOPHUM: many of the ancient philosophers wrote\r\npopular treatises in which the principles of philosophy were applied to the\r\nalleviation of sorrow. The most famous of these in Cicero's time was\r\nCrantor's περι πενθους, which Cicero used largely in writing his _Tusculan\r\nDisputations_, and also in his _De Consolatione_ on the death of his\r\ndaughter. -- IN LUCE ... CIVIUM: 'in public and under the gaze of his\r\nfellow-countrymen'. Do not translate _in oculis_ by the English phrase 'in\r\nthe eyes of', which has another sense. The metaphor in _lux_ is often used\r\nby Cicero, as Qu. Fr. 1, 1, 7 _in luce Asiae, in oculis provinciae_. --\r\nNOTITIA: _notitia_ is general knowledge, often merely the result of\r\nsuperficial observation; _scientia_ is thorough knowledge, the result of\r\nelaboration and generalization. -- MULTAE LITTERAE: 'great literary\r\nattainments.' In this sense _magnae_ could not be used to represent\r\n'great'. Note the ellipsis of _erant_. -- UT IN HOMINE ROMANO: 'considering\r\nthat he was a Roman', or 'for a Roman'. On the backwardness of the Romans\r\nin literary pursuits see Teuffel, Hist. of Rom. Lit, § 2; cf. also Ritter,\r\nHist. of Ancient Philosophy, Vol. IV. pp. 1-13, Eng. ed. In parenthetic\r\nclauses like this, the introductory _ut_ may convey two very different\r\nmeanings according to the context. Thus in Acad. 2, 98 _homo acutus, ut\r\nPoenus_ is 'a keen witted man, _as might be expected of_ a Carthaginian'\r\n(cf Colum 1, 3, 8 _acutissimam gentem Poenos_) while Nepos, Epam. 5, 2\r\n_exercitatum in dicendo ut Thebanum_ implies that oratory was _not_ to be\r\nexpected of a Theban. -- DOMESTICA ... EXTERNA BELLA: here the _domestica\r\nbella_ are those wars which belong to the history of Rome, the _externa\r\nbella_ those wars which belong to the history of other states; but usually\r\n_domestica bella_ are civil wars, _externa_ foreign wars in which Rome is\r\nengaged; _e.g._ Leg. agr. 2, 90 _omnibus domesticis externisque bellis_; in\r\nCatil 2, 11 _omnia sunt externa unius virtute pacata; domesticum bellum\r\nmanet, intus insidiae sunt_. The practice of reading military history was\r\ncommon among Roman commanders; see for instance Acad. 2, 3 of Lucullus; the\r\npractice is ridiculed by Marius in Sall. Iug. 85. -- ITA: _ita_ does not\r\nqualify _cupide_, and has not the sense of _tam_, it means rather 'in this\r\nstate', 'under these conditions'; the words from _quasi_ to the end of the\r\nsentence really form an explanation of _ita_. This mode of expression is\r\noften found, _ita_ and _sic_ frequently look on to clauses introduced by\r\n_quasi_, _si_, _ut_, _cum_ etc. Cf below 26 _sic quasi, cupiens_ (where see\r\nn.); Sall. Iug. 85, 19 _ita aetatem agunt quasi vestros honores contemnunt,\r\nita hos petunt quasi honeste vixerint_. -- DIVINAREM: see references on 6\r\n_confeceris_. -- ILLO EXSTINCTO: Fabius died in 203 B.C. -- FORE UNDE\r\nDISCEREM NEMINEM: cf. Acad. 1, 8 _quae nemo adhuc docuerat nec erat unde\r\nstudiosi scire possent. Unde_ of persons (here = _a quo_); is common in\r\nboth verse and prose (so ‛οθεν and ‛οθενπερ, vid. Liddell and Scott in\r\nvv.); cf. Horace 1, 12, 17 _unde nil maius generatur ipso_; 1, 28, 28; Cic.\r\nde Or. 1, 67 _ille ipse unde cognorit_; ib. 2, 285. So _ubi = apud quem_ in\r\nVerr. 4, 29; _quo = ad quos_ below, 83, and in Verr. 4 38; cf. also n. on\r\n_istinc_ in 47. For mood of _discerem_ see A. 320; G. 634; H. 503, I.\r\n\r\n13. QUORSUS IGITUR HAEC: _sc. dixi._ -- TAM MULTA: this takes the place of\r\n_tot_, which, like _quot_, cannot be used as a substantive. -- SCIPIONES:\r\n'men like Scipio', _i.e._ the elder Africanus; so 15 _Fabricii Curii\r\nCoruncanii_. Cicero has here put his own opinion of Scipio into the mouth\r\nof Cato, who, during a large part of his life, was a staunch and even\r\nbitter opponent of Scipio, and therefore not likely to couple him with\r\nFabius. Cf. Introd. -- UT ... RECORDENTUR: the repetition of _ut_ with each\r\nclause for the sake of effect may be compared with the repetition of\r\n_nihil_ in 15, 27, 41; of _non_ in 32; of _hinc_ in 40; of _sibi_ in 58. --\r\nPEDESTRIS: for _terrestris_; the usage is very common; so in Greek\r\nπεζομαχια and ναυμαχια, πεζομαχειν and ναυμαχειν are often contrasted (see\r\nLiddell and Scott). It is not recorded by historians that either Scipio or\r\nFabius took part personally in naval warfare. -- RECORDENTUR: this verb\r\nimplies the habitual dwelling of the memory upon the past. -- QUIETE ET\r\nPURE ATQUE ELEGANTER: the enumeration consists of two branches connected by\r\n_et_, the second branch being subdivided into two members connected by\r\n_atque_. Had each of the adverbs been intended to stand on exactly the same\r\nfooting Cic. would have written _et_ instead of _atque_, or else would have\r\nomitted the copula altogether; see n. on 53 _capitum iugatio_. In\r\nenumerations of the form A + (Bl + B2), the + outside the bracket is\r\nexpressed by _et_, the + inside the bracket generally being expressed by\r\n_ac_, for which _atque_ is substituted when the following word (_i.e._ B2)\r\nbegins with a vowel, a guttural (_c, q, g_) or _h_, before which _ac_ was\r\nvery seldom written. -- PURE ATQUE ELEGANTER: 'sinlessly and gently'.\r\n_Pure_ implies moral stainlessness, _eleganter_, literally 'in choice\r\nfashion', implies daintiness combined with simplicity in regard to the\r\nexternal conditions of life. The same ideas are put together in Sull. 79\r\n_cum summa elegantia atque integritate vixistis_. -- AETATIS: see n. on 5.\r\n-- PLACIDA AC LENIS: 'quiet and mild'; _placida_ refers to the external\r\nsurroundings, _lenis_ to the temper and character. -- ACCEPIMUS: _sc.\r\nfuisse_; for the ellipsis of the infinitive cf. n. on 22 _videretur_. --\r\nUNO ET OCTOGESIMO: but below _quarto_ (not _quattuor_) _nonagesimo_. In the\r\ncompound _ordinal_ numbers corresponding to those _cardinal_ numbers which\r\nare made up of one and a multiple of ten, the Latins use _unus_ oftener\r\nthan _primus_, which would be strictly correct; so in English 'one and\r\neightieth' for 'eighty-first'. The ordinary Grammar rule (Roby, Vol. I, p.\r\n443 'the _ordinal_ not the _cardinal_ is used in giving the date') requires\r\nslight correction. For the position of the words see G. 94, 3; H. 174,\r\nfootnote 3. -- SCRIBENS EST MORTUUS: 'died while still engaged upon his\r\nworks'; cf. 23 _num Platonem ... coegit in suis studiis obmutiscere\r\nsenectus?_ Diog. Laert. 3, 2 quoting Hermippus (a Greek writer of biography\r\nwho lived about the time of the Second Punic war), says that Plato died in\r\nthe middle of a marriage-feast at which he was a guest. Val. Max. 8, 7, 3\r\ngives a slightly different account. -- ISOCRATI: this form of the genitive\r\nof Greek proper names in _-es_ was probably used by Cicero rather than the\r\nform in _-is_; see Madvig on Fin. 1, 14; Neue, Formenlehre, 1² 332.\r\nIsocrates, the greatest teacher of rhetoric of his time, lived from 436 to\r\n338, when he died by voluntary starvation owing to his grief at the loss of\r\nGreek freedom through the battle of Chaeronea. Milton, Sonnet X. 'That\r\ndishonest victory At Chaeronea, fatal to liberty, Kill'd with report that\r\nold man eloquent'. -- EUM ... INSCRIBITUR: the periphrasis is common, and\r\nthe verb _inscribere_ is nearly always in the present tense (in later prose\r\nas well as in Cicero) as in 59. This is sometimes the case even where the\r\nneighboring verbs are in past tenses, as in Acad. 1, 12 _nec se tenuit quin\r\ncontra suum doctorem librum etiam ederet qui Sosus inscribitur_. The\r\npresent seems to mean that the name mentioned is continually given to each\r\ncopy of the book as produced; where the continuing multiplication of copies\r\nis not looked to, we have the perfect, as Att. 8, 5, 2 _tu fasciculum_\r\n(bundle of letters) _qui est inscriptus 'des M'. Curio', velim cures ad eum\r\nperferendum_. Cf. also De Or. 2, 61 _deceptus indicibus librorum qui sunt\r\nfere inscripti_ ('to which the authors--once for all--have given the\r\ntitles') _de virtute, de iustitia_, etc.; so Div. 2, 1 _eo libro qui\r\ninscriptus Hortensius_. -- DICIT: the 'Panathenaicus', an encomium of\r\nAthens written for recitation at the great festival of the Panathenaea, is\r\namong the works of Isocrates which we still possess. In c. 1 Isocrates says\r\nτοις ετεσι ενενηκοντα και τετταρσιν, ‛ων εγω τυγχανω γεγονως. -- VIXITQUE:\r\n'and yet he lived'. The _que_ here has a slight adversative force, as is\r\noften the case with _et_. Cf. n. on 28, 43, 73. -- GORGIAS: the greatest of\r\nthe sophists, born at Leontini in Sicily about 485 B.C.; his death took\r\nplace, according to the varying accounts, in 380, 378, or 377. In his old\r\nage he lived in Thessaly where Isocrates studied with him; see Or. 176;\r\nFin. 2, 1. For the adjective _Leontinus_ placed before the name rather than\r\nafter cf. 43 _Thessalo Cinea_. -- CENTUM ET SEPTEM ANNOS: Kennedy, Gram., §\r\n34, vii, _c_, says, 'in compound numbers above 100 the larger number, with\r\nor without _et_, generally precedes the smaller'; cf. Roby, Vol. 1 p. 443.\r\n-- CESSO: does not correspond in meaning with our 'cease', _i.e._ '_to come\r\nto_ a standstill'; _cesso_ is 'I am in a state of rest', 'I am idle'. --\r\nQUAERERETUR: the past tense, though the principal verb _inquit_, is in the\r\npresent, because the present is the _historical_ present and so equivalent\r\nto a past tense. Cf. Roby, 1511-1514; Kennedy 229, 2. A. 287, _e_; G. 511,\r\nRem. 1; H. 495, II. The idiom by which the imperfect stands where we should\r\nexpect a tense of completed action, should be noticed; cf. Tusc. 2, 60\r\n_quem cum rogaret, respondit._ The explanation of the imperfect in such\r\ncases is that it marks out, more clearly than the pluperfect would, the\r\nfact that the action of the principal verb and the action of the dependent\r\nverb are practically contemporaneous. In our passage if _quaesitum esset_\r\nhad been written it would have indicated merely that at some quite\r\nindefinite time after the question was put the answer was given. Cf. N.D.\r\n1, 60 _auctore ... obscurior_. -- CUR ... VITA: a hint at suicide, which\r\nthe ancients thought a justifiable mode of escape from troubles,\r\nparticularly those of ill health or old age. See n. on 73 _vetat\r\nPythagoras. Esse in vita_ is stronger than _vivere_; cf. Qu. Fr. 1, 3, 5.\r\n-- NIHIL HABEO QUOD ACCUSEM: 'I have no reason to reproach'. Cf. the common\r\nphrase _quid est quod ...? Quod_, adverbial acc. A. 240, _a_; G. 331, R. 3;\r\nH. 378, 2. For mood of _accusem_ see H. 503, I. n. 2, and references on 12\r\n_discerem_. -- PRAECLARUM RESPONSUM: _est_ is not required, because\r\n_responsum_ is in apposition to the last part of the preceding sentence.\r\nSimilar appositions occur in Laelius, 67, 71, 79. -- DOCTO: applied\r\nespecially to philosophers, but also to poets. The word implies\r\n_cultivation_ as well as mere _knowledge_; 'a learned man', merely as such,\r\nis '_homo litteratus_'; cf. n. on 54.\r\n\r\nP. 7. -- 14. CUIUS ... FECI: 'the aforesaid' is in good Latin always\r\nexpressed by a parenthesis like this and not by a participle in agreement\r\nwith the noun. The phrases '_ante dictus_', '_supra dictus_', belong to\r\nsilver Latin, where they are common. Cf. 23 _quos ante dixi_. -- SIC UT\r\netc.: the lines are from the Annals of Ennius, for which see n. on 1. --\r\nECUS: Ennius did not write _uu_, nor most likely did Cicero; the former may\r\nhave written either _ecus, equos,_ or _equs_. The last form Vahlen prints\r\nin his edition of Ennius. -- SPATIO SUPREMO: 'at the end of the\r\nrace-course', 'at the goal', or it may be 'at the last turn round the\r\ncourse', the race requiring the course to be run round several times; cf.\r\nHomer's πυματον δρομον in Iliad 23, 768. So 83 _decurso spatio_; Verg. Aen.\r\n5, 327 _iamque fere spatio extreme fessique sub ipsam finem adventabant_.\r\n-- VICIT OLUMPIA: a direct imitation of the Greek phrase νικαν Ολυμπια, to\r\nwin a victory at an Olympic contest. So Horace Ep. 1, 1, 50 has _coronari\r\nOlympia_ = στεφανουσθαι Ολυμπια. The editors print _Olympia_, but the use\r\nof _y_ to represent Greek υ did not come in till long after the time of\r\nEnnius. -- SENIO: differs from _senectute_ in implying not merely old age,\r\nbut the weakness which usually accompanies it. -- CONFECTUS: for the\r\ndisregard of the final _s_ in scanning cf. n. on 1, l. 6. -- EQUI VICTORIS:\r\nfor the almost adjectival use of the substantive _victor_, cf. Verg. Aen.\r\n7, 656 _victores equos_; ib. 12, 751 _venator canis_; ib. 10, 891; 11, 89,\r\nand Georg. 2, 145 _bellator equus_, in Theocritus 15, 51 πολεμισται ‛ιπποι.\r\nThe feminine nouns in _-trix_ are freely used as adjectives both in verse\r\nand in prose. A. 88, _c_; H. 441, 3. -- QUEM QUIDEM: the same form of\r\ntransition is used in 26, 29, 46, 53. The whole of this passage to\r\n_suasissem_ is an exhibition of antiquarian learning quite unnatural and\r\ninappropriate in a dialogue. -- PROBE MEMINISSE POTESTIS: cf. De Or. 3, 194\r\n_quem tu probe meministi_; Fin. 2, 63 _L. Thorius quem meminisse tu non\r\npotes. Memini_ can take a _personal_ accusative only when the person who\r\nremembers was a contemporary of the person remembered; otherwise the gen.\r\nfollows. Cf. Roby, 1333; A. 219, Rem.; H. 407, n. 1. -- HI CONSULES: 'the\r\npresent consuls'. -- T. FLAMININUS: commonly said to be the son of the\r\ngreat Flamininus (1, l. 1). He was altogether undistinguished, as also were\r\nthe Acilius and the Caepio here mentioned. This passage gives the imagined\r\ndate of the dialogue as 150 B.C. -- PHILIPPO: this was Q. Marcius\r\nPhilippus, who was consul in 186 and took part in the suppression of the\r\ngreat Bacchanalian conspiracy of that year. For the next 17 years he was a\r\nleading senator and much engaged in diplomacy in the East. In 169 he was\r\nagain consul and commanded against Perseus in the early part of the war. --\r\nCUM ... LEGEM VOCONIAM ... SUASISSEM: 'after I had spoken publicly in favor\r\nof the law o£ Voconius'. For _suasissem_ cf. 10 _suasor_ with n. The _Lex\r\nVoconia de mulierum hereditatibus_ aimed at securing the continuance of\r\nproperty in families. By its provisions no man who possessed property\r\nvalued in the censors' lists at 100,000 sesterces or more, could appoint a\r\nwoman or women as his _heres_ or _heredes_; further, no person or persons,\r\nmale or female, could receive under the will legacies amounting in all to a\r\nlarger sum than that received by the principal heir or heirs. Every Roman\r\nwill named a _heres_ or _heredes_, on whom devolved all the privileges and\r\nduties of the deceased, with such duties as were enjoined by the will;\r\nparticularly the duty of paying the legacies left to those who were not\r\n_heredes_. See Maine, Ancient Law, Ch. 6; also Hunter, Introd. to Roman\r\nLaw, Ch. 5. -- MAGNA: in Latin the word _magnus_ is the only equivalent of\r\nour 'loud'. -- LATERIBUS: 'lungs'. Cic. and the best writers rarely use\r\n_pulmones_ for 'lungs'; the few passages in which it occurs either refer to\r\nvictims sacrificed at the altar, or are medical or physiological\r\ndescriptions. 'Good lungs' is always '_bona latera_' never _pulmones_. --\r\nDUO ... SENECTUTEM: Ennius is said to have kept a school in his later days,\r\nand to have lived in a cottage with one servant only.\r\n\r\n15. ETENIM: this word generally introduces either an explanation or a proof\r\nof a preceding statement. Here the words are elliptic, and the real\r\nconnection with what precedes can only be made clear by a paraphrase.\r\n'Ennius seemed to delight in old age. And no wonder, since there are four\r\ncauses which make men think old age wretched, and no one of these will bear\r\nexamination'. _Etenim_ may generally be translated 'indeed', or 'in fact'.\r\n-- CUM COMPLECTOR ANIMO: 'when I grasp them in my thoughts'. The object of\r\n_complector_ is to be supplied from _causas_. -- AVOCET: _sc. senes_. The\r\nsubjunctives denote that these are the thoughts not of the speaker, but of\r\nthe persons who do think old age a wretched thing. See n. on 3 _ferat_; but\r\ncf. Kennedy, Grammar, pref., p. 30. -- ALTERAM ... TERTIAM: in enumerations\r\nof more than two things _unus and alter_ generally take the place of\r\n_primus_, and _secundus_: in Cic. these latter rarely occur under such\r\ncircumstances. Cf. Att. 3, 15, 1; Fin. 5, 9; Off. 1, 152; Cluent. 178. --\r\nINFIRMIUS: _sc. auam antea erat_. -- QUAM SIT IUSTA: Cicero generally\r\nseparates from the words they qualify _quam_, _tam_, _ita_, _tantus_,\r\n_quantus_, often, as here, by one small word. Cf. below, 35 _quam fuit\r\nimbecillus_; 40 _tam esse inimicum_. -- QUIBUS: the preposition _a_ is\r\noften omitted; cf. in Pis. 91 _Arsinoen ... Naupactum fateris ab hostibus\r\nesse captas. Quibus hostibus? Nempe eis_ etc.; Tusc. 3, 37 _sed traducis\r\ncogitationes meas ad voluptates. Quas?_ Even when relative and antecedent\r\nare in the same sentence the preposition is not often repeated; _e.g._ Fin.\r\n5, 68 _eodem in genere quo illa_. -- AN EIS: _an_ always introduces a\r\nquestion which is not independent, but follows upon a previous question\r\neither expressed or implied. Here _quibus_ implies _omnibusne_. Cf. div. in\r\nCaec. 52 _quid enim dices? An id quod dictitas_ ... where _quid_ implies\r\n_nihilne_: also below, 23, 29 _anne_. A 211, _b_; G. 459; H. 353, 2, n. 4.\r\n-- IUVENTUTE ET VIRIBUS: commonly explained as a hendiadys, _i.e._ as put\r\nfor _iuventutis viribus_; but Cic. no more meant this than we mean 'the\r\nstrength of youth' when we speak of 'youth and strength'. Real instances of\r\nhendiadys are much rarer than is generally supposed. -- QUAE: = _tales ut_.\r\n-- L. PAULUS: this is L. Aemilius Paulus Macedonicus, consul in 182 B.C.,\r\nand again in 168 when he finished the third Macedonian war by utterly\r\ndefeating Perseus at Pydna. For his connection with Scipio and Cato see\r\nIntrod. -- PATER TUUS: _i.e. Scipio_; so in 29 _avi tui_, and in 75 _avum\r\ntuum_, without mention of young Scipio's name, but in 49 _patris tui,\r\nScipio_; so 77. -- FABRICII etc.: for the plurals see n. on 13. C.\r\nFabricius Luscinus, consul in 282, 278, and 273 B.C., censor in 275, held\r\nthe command against Pyrrhus. The Roman writers, Cicero especially, are\r\nnever tired of eulogizing him as a pattern of old-fashioned Roman virtue.\r\nManius Curius Dentatus, consul in 290, 275, and 274 practically, if not\r\nformally, ended the third Samnite war, and also commanded against Pyrrhus;\r\nsee 55. He was famed for his sturdy Roman simplicity and frugality.\r\nTiberius Coruncanius as consul in 280 crushed an Etruscan insurrection. In\r\n252 he became the first plebeian pontifex maximus. These three men are very\r\nfrequently mentioned together by Cicero; cf. below, 43, Lael. 18. -- NIHIL\r\nAGEBANT: observe that _nihil agebat_ is put at the beginning of the first\r\nsentence, _nihil agebant_ at the end of the second; chiasmus.\r\n\r\n16. A. CLAUDI: Appius Claudius, the head of the most strongly aristocratic\r\nfamily in Rome, was censor in 311 B.C., when he constructed the _via\r\nAppia_, and consul in 307 and 296. He had to be carried into the\r\nsenate-house in order to oppose the peace with Pyrrhus -- ACCEDEBAT UT:\r\n_accedit_ is far oftener followed by a clause with _quod_ and indicative\r\nthan by a clause with _ut_ and subjunctive. When the _quod_ clause follows,\r\nit contains a fact looked at merely as a fact and nothing more, but the\r\n_ut_ clause views the fact as consequent upon, or dependent on some other\r\nfact. Here the blindness is regarded as being the consequence of old age,\r\nthough Livy 9, 29, 11 and other authors attribute it to the anger of the\r\ngods, because as censor Appius had taken the administration of the worship\r\nof Hercules away from the ancient family of the Potitii, and had placed it\r\nin the hands of public slaves. The mental vigor of Appius in his old age is\r\nmentioned by Cic. in Tusc. 5, 112.\r\n\r\nP. 8. -- CUM PYRRHO: note the position of the words between _pacem_ and\r\n_foedus_, with both of which they go. This usage is called by the\r\ngrammarians _coniunctio_; cf. n. on Lael. 8 _cum summi viri tum\r\namicissimi_, also above, _quae iuventute geruntur et viribus_, below 18\r\n_quae sunt gerenda praescribo et quo modo_. -- FOEDUS: this seems opposed\r\nto _pacem_ as a formal engagement is to a mere abstention from hostilities.\r\n-- NON DUBITAVIT DICERE: when _dubitare_ means 'to hesitate' (about a\r\ncourse of action), and the sentence is _negative_, or an interrogative\r\nsentence assuming a negative answer, the infinitive construction generally\r\nfollows, as here; but the infinitive is rare in a _positive_ sentence. When\r\n_dubitare_ means to 'be in doubt' (as to whether certain statements are\r\ntrue or not), the regular construction is either _quin_ with subj. or some\r\nform of indirect interrogative clause. Cf. below, 25. -- QUO VOBIS: from\r\nthe _Annales_. In _mentis dementis_ we have _oxymoron_ (an intentional\r\ncontradiction in terms) as in 38 _sensum sine sensu_; 39 _munus ...\r\naufert_. On the case of _vobis_, see Roby, 1154, A. 235, _a_, H. 384, 4, n.\r\n2. -- ANTEHAC: always a dissyllable in verse, and probably so pronounced in\r\nprose -- VIAI: the old genitive. A. 36 _a_, G. 27, Rem. 1, H. 49, 2. The\r\nreading is not quite certain, if _viai_ be read it is not altogether\r\ncertain whether it depends on _quo_ or on _sese flexere_. In the former\r\nconstruction we have a partitive gen with an adv; A. 216, _a_, 4, G. 371,\r\nRem. 4, H. 397, 4, in the latter, a distinct Graecism like _desine\r\nquerellarum_ (Hor Od 2, 9, 17) and the like; A. 243 Rem., G. 373 Rem. 6, H.\r\n410 V 4. -- ET TAMEN: the sense is incompletely expressed, in full it is\r\n'and yet there is no need for me to refer to Appius' speech as given by\r\nEnnius, since the speech itself is in existence.' Exactly similar ellipses\r\nare found with _et tamen_ in Fin 1, 11 and 15; 2, §§ 15, 21, 64 and 85,\r\nAtt. 7, 3, 10, Lucretius 5, 1177. In Munro's note on the last passage a\r\ncollection of examples will be found. -- APPI ... ORATIO: the speech was\r\nknown to Cicero, and was one of the oldest monuments of prose composition\r\nin Latin extant in his time, see Brut. 61. Plutarch, Pyrrhus 19, gives an\r\naccount of Appius' speech, which may founded on the original, he mentions\r\nit also in his tract commonly called '_an seni sit gerenda res publica_',\r\nc. 21. Ihne (History of Rome, Vol. I. p. 521, Eng. ed.) doubts whether the\r\nspeech, as Cic. knew it, was committed to writing by Appius himself. --\r\nHAEC ILLE EGIT: 'he made this speech'. -- SEPTEMDECIM ANNIS: as the second\r\n(_alterum_) consulship was in 296, and the speech in 280, both these years\r\nare included in the reckoning by a usage very common in Latin. For the\r\nablative cf. 19. -- CENSOR ... ANTE CONSULATUM: this was unusual, and\r\ntherefore to Claudius' honor. -- GRANDEM SANE: 'undoubtedly old'. -- ET\r\nTAMEN SIC: _i.e. eum tum grandem fuisse_ Lahmeyer wrongly says that _sic_\r\npoints to the words _atque haec ille egit_. It may be noted that _sic_\r\ntakes the place of an object after _accipimus_, cf. 77 _ita crederem_; 78\r\n_sic mihi persuasi_, also 18 _male cogitanti_.\r\n\r\n17. NIHIL AFFERUNT: 'they bring forward nothing', _i.e._ what they bring\r\nforward is worthless, so in Greek ουδεν λεγειν, the opposite of which is\r\nλεγειν τι. Cf. 8 _est istuc aliquid_. -- SIMILES UT SI: a very rare\r\nconstruction. Equally unusual is _similes tamquam si_ in Div. 2, 131. In\r\nTusc. 4, 41 and Off. 1, 87 we find _similiter ut si_ in Fin. 2, 21 and 4,\r\n31 _similiter_ or _similis et si_, in N.D. 3, 8 _similiter ac si_, also in\r\nLiv. 5, 5, 12 _dissimilia ac si_, in 35, 42, 10 _idem ac si_. As regards\r\nthe _ut_ after _similes_, we may compare a few passages in which _simul ut_\r\nappears for _simul ac_, see Reid's n. on Academ 2, 51. In the English Bible\r\nthere are expressions like _similes sunt ut si qui dicant_, 'they are like\r\nas if some men should say.' -- SCANDANT: '_cum_ is used with the\r\nsubjunctive when it expresses a kind of comparison, and especially a\r\ncontrast, between the contents of a leading proposition and a subordinate\r\n(\"whereas\", etc.)' Madvig, 358, Obs. 3. The underlying idea in this use is\r\ngenerally cause, sometimes concession. -- PER FOROS 'over the deck'. --\r\nILLE: for the omission of _sed_ or _autem_ (_asyndeton adversativum_) see\r\nn. on 3 _librum_, etc. -- CLAVUM: 'tiller'. With this passage Lahmeyer well\r\ncompares what Cicero says of himself in Fam. 9, 15, 3 _sedebamus in puppi\r\net clavum tenebamus; nunc autem vix est in sentina locus_. -- VELOCITATE:\r\n_velocitas_ and _celeritas_ differ very slightly; the former means rather\r\nspeed of movement in one line the latter rather power of rapid motion with\r\nfrequent change of direction. The emphatic word in this clause is\r\n_corporum_. Cf. Off. 1, 79 _honestum ... animi efficitur non corporis\r\nviribus_. -- CONSILIO ... SENTENTIA: _consilio_, advice; _auctoritate_,\r\nweight of influence; _sententia,_ an opinion or vote formally given. --\r\nQUIBUS: in twofold relation; with _orbari_, abl. of separation, with\r\n_augeri_ of specification.\r\n\r\n18. NISI FORTE: ironical, used to introduce a possible, but absurd\r\nobjection to something which has gone before. The verb that follows is\r\nalways in the indicative. -- MILES etc.: 'as common soldier'; see n. on 10.\r\n-- IN VARIO GENERE: we use the plural, 'in different kinds'. Cf. Acad. 2, 3\r\n_in omni genere belli_; Deiot. 12 _in omni genere bellorum_. -- CESSARE:\r\ncf. n. on 13. -- AT SENATUI etc.: exactly the same ideas are expressed,\r\nwith the same mention of Cato's activity in Off. 1, 79. -- MALE COGITANTI:\r\n'which has now for a long time been plotting mischief'; A. 290, _a_; G.\r\n671, 221; H. 549, 4; 467, III. 2. Cf. pro Sulla 70 _nefarie cogitare_; for\r\nthe use of the adverb see n. on 16 _sic_. On Cato's attitude toward\r\nCarthage see Introd. -- VERERI: the construction is unusual. _Vereor_\r\nregularly takes after it an accusative, or else a clause with _ne_ or _ut_.\r\nA passage much resembling this is Rab. Post. 10 _omnes qui aliquid de se\r\nverebantur_; cf. also Att. 10, 4, 6 _de vita sua metuere_; Verg. Aen. 9,\r\n207 _de te nil tale verebar_; in all these examples the ablative with _de_\r\ndenotes the quarter threatened, not, as here, the quarter from which the\r\nthreat comes. -- EXSCISAM: from _exscindo_; most edd. _excisam_, but to\r\nraze a city is _urbem exscindere_ not _excidere_; _e.g._ Rep. 6, 11\r\n_Numantiam exscindes_.\r\n\r\n19. QUAM PALMAM etc.: a prophecy after the event, like that in Rep. 6, 11\r\n_avi relliquias_, the finishing up of the Punic wars. For the use of\r\n_relliquias_ cf. Verg. Aen. 11, 30 _Troas relliquias Danaum atque immitis\r\nAchilli_; ib. 598; ib. 3, 87. -- TERTIUS: so all our MSS. This places the\r\nelder Scipio's death in 183, which agrees with Livy's account in 39, 50,\r\n10. But the year before Cato's censorship was 185 not 183, hence some edd.\r\nread _quintus_ and some _sextus_ in place of _tertius_.\r\n\r\nP. 9. -- NOVEM ANNIS: as Cato's consulship was in 195 these words also\r\napparently disagree with _tertius_ above. _Novem annis post_ means nine\r\n_full_ years after, _i.e._ 185 not 186; cf. 42 _septem annis post_. --\r\nENIM: implies that the answer 'no' has been given to the question and\r\nproceeds to account for that answer. -- EXCURSIONE: a military term =\r\n'skirmishing'; Cf. Div. 2, 26 _prima orationis excursio_. -- HASTIS:\r\nloosely used for _pilis_. The long old Roman _hasta_, whence the name\r\n_hastati_, had long before Cato's time been discarded for the _pilum_ or\r\nshort javelin, which was thrown at the enemy from a distance before the\r\ntroops closed and used the sword. -- CONSILIUM: the repetition of consilium\r\nin a different sense from that which it had in the sentence before seems to\r\nus awkward; but many such repetitions are found in Cicero. _Consilium_\r\ncorresponds to both 'counsel' and 'council'; the senate was originally\r\n_regium consilium_, the king's body of advisers. Here translate _summum\r\nconsilium_ 'the supreme deliberative body'. -- SENATUM: 'assembly of\r\nelders'. Cf. 56 _senatores, id est senes_. _Senatus_ implies a lost verb\r\n_sen[=a]-re_, to be or grow old from the stem of which both _sen[=a]-tus_\r\nand _sen[=a]-tor_ are derived. This stem again implies a lost noun or\r\nadjective _senus_, old. The word _senatus_ was collective, like\r\n_comitatus_, a body of companions, _exercitus_, a trained band etc.\r\n\r\n20. AMPLISSIMUM: 'most honorable'. -- UT SUNT ... SENES: the Spartan\r\nγερουσια, as it is commonly called, consisted of 28 members, all over 60\r\nyears of age. Herodotus uses the term γεροντες (_senes_) for this assembly;\r\nXenophon γεροντια. In the Laconian dialect γερωια was its name; we also\r\nfind γεροντευειν 'to be a senator'. For _ut ... sic_ cf. Academ. 2, 14,\r\n_similiter vos cum perturbare, ut illi rem publicam_, _sic vos philosophiam\r\nvelitis_; also Lael. 19. -- AUDIRE: like ακουω, used especially of\r\nhistorical matters, since instruction in them was almost entirely oral. Cf.\r\nανηκοος = 'ignorant of history'. -- VOLETIS: see note on 7 _faciam ut\r\npotero_; cf. Roby, 1464, _a_; Madvig, 339, Obs. 1; A. 278, _b_; G. 234,\r\nRem. 1; H. 470, 2. -- ADULESCENTIBUS: Cic., when he wrote this, was\r\npossibly thinking of Athens and Alcibiades. -- LABEFACTATAS: the verb\r\n_labefacio_ is foreign to good prose, in which _labefacto_ is used. --\r\nSUSTENTATAS: Cic. does not use _sustentus_. In Mur. 3 _sustinenda_ is\r\nfollowed by _sustentata_ in the same sentence. -- CEDO ... CITO: the line\r\nis of the kind called tetrameter iambic acatalectic (or octonarius), and is\r\nscanned thus: --\r\n\r\n  v v -' | - - | - -' | v - || - -' | - - | - -' | v -.\r\n\r\nIn all kinds of iambic verse the old Romans freely introduced spondees\r\nwhere the Greeks used iambi; so in hexameters spondees for dactyls. Cf.\r\nHor. Ep. ad Pis. 254 _et seq._ -- CEDO: = _dic_; from _ce_, the enclitic\r\nparticle involved in _hic = (hi-ce)_ etc. and _da_, the root of _do_. So\r\n_cette = ce-d[)a]te = cedte_, then _cette_ by assimilation of _d_ to _t_.\r\nThe original meaning would thus be 'give here', and in this sense the word\r\nis often used. See Lex. _Dare_ is commonly put for _dicere_, as _accipere_\r\nis for _audire_. -- QUI: 'how'. -- TANTAM: = οτσαυτην ουσαν. -- NAEVI:\r\nNaevius lived about 264-194 B.C. His great work was a history of the First\r\nPunic War written in Saturnian verse, the rude indigenous metre of early\r\nRoman poetry. He wrote also plays,--tragedies and comedies, both\r\n_palliatae_ and _praetextae_. For an account of him see Cruttwell, History\r\nof Roman Literature; also, Sellar, Roman Poets of the Republic, Ch. 3. If\r\n_Ludo_ be read, it may be either from the Latin _ludus_ (Naevius entitled a\r\ncomedy _Ludius_) or from Λυδος, Lydian. -- POETAE: Naevius seems to have\r\nbeen in the habit of adding _poeta_ to his name. It appears in the\r\nwell-known epitaph said to have been written by himself, also in the lines\r\nwritten against him by the family poet of the Metelli: '_malum dabunt\r\nMetelli Naevio poetae_'. The name _poeta_ was new in Naevius' time and was\r\njust displacing the old Latin name _vates_; see Munro on Lucr. 1, 102. --\r\nPROVENIEBANT etc.: the same metre as above, divided thus by Lahmeyer: --\r\n\r\n  _provéni | ebant | orát | ores || noví | stultí adu | lescén / iuli_.\r\n\r\nThe whole line has the look of being translated from the Greek: προυβαινον\r\n(εις το βημα) ‛ρητορες κανοι τινες, μειρακια γελοια. Lr. takes _provenire_\r\nin the sense of 'to grow up', comparing Plin. Ep. 1, 13, 1 _magnum\r\nproventum_ ('crop') _poetarum annus hic attulit_; Sall. Cat. 8, 3\r\n_provenere ibi scriptorum magna ingenia_. -- VIDELICET: 'you see'.\r\n\r\n21. AT: = αλλα γαρ; used, as in 32, 35, 47, 65, and 68, to introduce the\r\nsupposed objection of an opponent. -- CREDO: 'of course'. Cf. 47 where\r\n_credo_ follows _at_ as here. -- EXERCEAS: the subject is the indefinite\r\n'you' equivalent to 'one', τις: 'unless one were to practise it'. So 28\r\n_nequeas_; 33 _requiras_. Cf. also Plin. Ep. 8, 14, 3 _difficile est tenere\r\nquae acceperis, nisi exerceas_. For the mood see A. 309, _a_; G. 598, 597,\r\nRem. 3; H. 508, 5, 2). -- TARDIOR: 'unusually dull'; cf. Academ. 2, 97\r\n_Epicurus quem isti tardum putant_. -- THEMISTOCLES: famed for his memory.\r\n-- CIVIUM: 'fellow-countrymen'; _perceperat_: 'had grasped' or 'mastered'.\r\n-- QUI ... SOLITUM: 'that he often addressed as Lysimachus some one who for\r\nall that was Aristides'. The direct object of _salutare_ is omitted. For\r\n_qui = tametsi is_ cf. Att. 1, 13, 3 _nosmet ipsi, qui Lycurgei fuissemus,\r\ncotidie demitigamur_; also De Or. 1, 82. -- ESSET: A.342; G.631; H.529, II.\r\nand n. 1, 1). -- LYSIMACHUM: for _ut L._ or _pro Lysimacho_. So Arch. 19\r\n_Homerum Chii suum vindicant_ (= _ut suum_ or _pro suo_). Lysimachus was\r\nthe father of Aristides. -- SUNT: = _vivunt_, as often; so in 32 _esse =\r\nvivere_; 54 _fuit = vixit_; 56, 60, 69. -- SEPULCRA LEGENS: Cato was a\r\ngreat antiquarian; cf. 38 _Originum_. -- IN MEMORIAM REDEO MORTUORUM: the\r\ngenitive as with _memini, recordari_ etc. For the phrase cf. Verr. 1, 120\r\n_redite in memoriam, iudices, quae libido istius fuerit_; also below, 59\r\n_in gratiam redire cum voluptate_. Here translate 'I refresh my memory of\r\nthe dead'. -- QUEMQUAM SENEM: the best writers do not use _quisquam _as an\r\nadjective, but there is no need to alter _senem_ into _senum_ as some\r\neditors do, since _senem_ is a substitute for a clause _cum senex esset_;\r\n'I never heard that anybody because he was an old man ...'. _Senes_ must be\r\nso taken in 22, since _pontifices_ etc. cannot stand as adjectives. Cf. n.\r\non 10 _adulescentulus miles_. -- VADIMONIA: 'their appointments to appear\r\nin court, the debts due to them and the debts they owe'. When the hearing\r\nof a suit had to be adjourned, the defendant was bound over either on his\r\nown recognizance merely (_pure_) or along with sureties (_vades_) to appear\r\nin court on the day appointed for the next hearing, a sum or sums of money\r\nbeing forfeited in case of his non-appearance. The engagement to appear was\r\ntechnically called _vadimonium_; when the defendant entered into the\r\nengagement he was said _vadimonium promittere_; if he kept the engagement,\r\n_v. obire_ or _sistere_; if he failed in it, _v. deserere_. The plural\r\n_vadimonia_ is here used because a number of suits is meant; the word\r\n_constituta_ is chosen as a more general term than _promissa_, and as\r\nreferring to the circumstances of both plaintiff and defendant. Strictly\r\nspeaking, it is the presiding judge who _vadimonia constituit_. On this\r\naccount _vadimonia constituta_ should be translated as above\r\n'appointments', and not _'bonds'_ or _'engagements_' to appear in court.\r\n\r\nP. 10. -- 22. QUID ... SENES: _sc. tibi videntur_; 'what do you think of\r\nold men as lawyers, etc.?' So without ellipsis, Fam. 9, 21, 1 _quid tibi\r\nego in epistulis videor?_ -- INGENIA: = _suum cuique ingenium_; 'old men\r\nretain their wits'. -- PERMANEAT: A. 266, _d_; G. 575; H. 513, I. --\r\nSTUDIUM ET INDUSTRIA: 'earnestness and activity'; not a case of hendiadys,\r\nas some editors make it. Cf. n. on 15 _iuventute et viribus_. -- NEQUE EA\r\nSOLUM: = ουδε ταυτα μονον, 'and that not only'. -- HONORATIS: this does not\r\ncorrespond to our 'honored', but implies that the persons have held high\r\noffices (_honores_); cf. 61 _senectus honorata praesertim_. Here translate\r\n'statesmen'. -- IN VITA ... QUIETA: 'in an unofficial and retired life'.\r\nThere is chiasmus here, since _privata_ is contrasted with _honoratis_ and\r\n_quieta_ with _claris_. -- SUMMAM SENECTUTEM: Sophocles died at the age of\r\n90 in 405 B.C. -- QUOD PROPTER STUDIUM: 'from his devotion to this\r\noccupation'. -- FILIIS: except Plutarch, who probably follows Cicero's\r\nwords, all the authorities tell the story of the poet's eldest son Iophon\r\nonly. The tale is full of improbabilities. -- REM: = _rem familiarem_ as in\r\n1. -- PATRIBUS BONIS INTERDICI SOLET: 'fathers are often prevented from\r\nmanaging their property'. For the construction cf. the expression\r\n_interdicere alicui aqua et igni: interdici_ is here used impersonally with\r\n_patribus_ in the dat.; A. 230; H. 384, 5; _bonis_ is abl. of separation\r\n(deprivation). The fragment of the XII tables here referred to is thus\r\ngiven in Dirksen's edition: _sei fouriosos aut prodicos (prodigus) escit\r\n(erit) adenatorum centiliomque (gentiliumque) eius potestas estod, i.e._\r\nthe agnates (male relatives whose kinship with the _furiosus_ is derived\r\nthrough males) and members of his _gens_ are to administer his property. We\r\nhave preserved the form in which the judgment was made by the _praetor\r\nurbanus_ (Paulus, Sent. 3, 4a, 7): '_quando tibi tua bona paterna avitaque\r\nnequitia tua disperdis liberosque tuos ad egestatem perducis, ob eam rem\r\ntibi ea re commercioque interdico_'. -- QUASI DESIPIENTEM: '‛ως\r\nπαραφρονουντα' says the author of the anonymous life of Sophocles. Cf.\r\nXenophon, Mem. 1, 2, 49. -- IN MANIBUS HABEBAT: 'had on hand' _i.e._ in\r\npreparation. _Est in manibus_ in 12 has a different meaning. -- SCRIPSERAT:\r\nhe had written it but not finally corrected it. -- RECITASSE: the common\r\nversion of the story states that not the whole play was read but only the\r\nfine chorus beginning ευιππου, ξενε, τασδε χωρας. -- VIDERETUR: _sc. esse_;\r\nthe infinitive is often omitted thus after verbs of desiring, thinking\r\netc., also verbs of speaking and hearing; cf. Lael. 18 _eam sapientiam\r\ninterpretantur_; ib. 29 _quam natam volunt_; ib. 64 _homines ex maxime raro\r\ngenere iudicare;_ Acad. 2, 12 _viderenturne ea Philonis._\r\n\r\n23. HESIODUM: see n. on 54. -- Simoniden: Simonides of Ceos (not S. of\r\nAmorgos), one of the greatest Greek lyric poets, lived from 556 to about\r\n469 B.C. -- STESICHORUM: of Himera in Sicily, also a lyric poet; lived from\r\nabout 630 to about 556 B.C. -- ISOCRATEN GORGIAN: nn. on 13. --\r\nPHILOSOPHORUM PRINCIPES: 'in the first rank of philosophers'. --\r\nPYTHAGORAN: neither the date of his birth nor that of his death can be\r\ndetermined; he 'flourished' about 530. He lived mostly in the Greek\r\nsettlements of lower Italy, where his school existed for some centuries\r\nafter his death. -- DEMOCRITUM: of Abdera, one of the originators of the\r\ntheory of atoms; said to have lived from 460 to 361 or 357 B.C. --\r\nXENOCRATEN after Plato, Speusippus was the first head of the Academic\r\nSchool; Xenocrates succeeded him. He lived from 397 to 315 or 313. --\r\nZENONEM: of Citium in Cyprus, founder of Stoicism, born about 357, is said\r\nto have lived to the age of 98. -- CLEANTHEN: he followed Zeno in the\r\npresidency of the Stoic school. His age at death is variously given as 99\r\nand as 80 years. -- QUEM VIDISTIS: see Introd. It is rather curious that\r\nCic. should make Cato speak with admiration of Diogenes, to whom he had\r\nshown great hostility. -- DIOGENEN: Cic. probably wrote in _-an, -en,_ not\r\nin _-am, -em_ the accusatives of Greek proper names in _-as, -es_. --\r\nSTOICUM: to distinguish him from Diogenes the Cynic. -- AGITATIO: Cic. uses\r\n_agitatio_ and _actio_ almost interchangeably; cf. _agitatio rerum_ in De\r\nOr. 3, 88 with _actio rerum_ in Acad. 2, 62 and elsewhere. _Actus_ in this\r\nsense occurs only in silver Latin.\r\n\r\n24. AGE: a common form of transition to a new subject; brief for _'hoc\r\nage'_, 'do this', _i.e._ 'attend to this that I am going to say'. The\r\ncommon use of αγε in Greek is exactly similar. -- UT ... OMITTAMUS: Cf. n.\r\non 52 _ut_. -- POSSUM NOMINARE: 'I am able to name'; in colloquial English\r\n'I _might_ name'. The Latins occasionally use also a hypothetical form,\r\nwhere _possim_ or _possem_ stands in the apodosis of a conditional\r\nsentence, the protasis of which is not expressed; but the missing protasis\r\nis generally easily supplied and was distinctly present to the writer's\r\nmind. _E.g._ in Tusc. 1, 88 we have _dici hoc in te non potest; posset in\r\nTarquinio; at in mortuo ne intellegi quidem (potest)_, where the reason for\r\nthe change from _potest_ to _posset_ is quite evident. In translating from\r\nEnglish into Latin it is far safer to use the indicative. Cf. 55 _possum\r\npersequi_. A. 311, _c_; G. 599, Rem. 3; H. 511, 1, n. 3, 476, 4. -- EX AGRO\r\n... ROMANOS: 'country-bred Romans (_i.e._ Roman citizens) belonging to the\r\nSabine district'. The words _ex agro Sabino_ form an attributive phrase\r\nqualifying _Romanos_ just as _rusticos_ does. -- NUMQUAM FERE: 'scarcely\r\never'. -- MAIORA OPERA: 'farm work of any importance'. This use of _opera_\r\nis common in Vergil's Georgics. -- NON: the repetition of the negative\r\nafter _numquam_ is common in Latin; in English _never ... not_ is found in\r\ndialects only. Cf. Lael. 48 _non tantum ... non plus quam_. -- SERENDIS:\r\nablative of respect, 'as regards sowing'. See Roby 1210; Kennedy, 149. --\r\nPERCIPIENDIS: so 70; cf. N.D. 2, 156 _neque enim serendi neque colendi, nec\r\ntempestive demetendi percipiendi que fructus, neque condendi nec reponendi\r\nulla pecudum scientia est_. -- IN ALIIS: see n. on 3 _ceteris_. Notice the\r\nproleptic use. -- IDEM: a better form of the plural than _iidem_, commonly\r\nfound in our texts. For the use here cf. n. on 4 _eandem_. -- PERTINERE:\r\npresent for future. -- SENT ... PROSINT: the line is given as Ribbeck\r\nprints it. He scans it as a '_bacchius_', consisting of four feet, with the\r\nmeasurement | v - - |, the last syllable of _saeclo_ seeming to be\r\nshortened. Cicero quotes the same line in Tusc. 1, 31 adding _ut ait\r\n(Statius) in Synephebis, quid spectans nisi etiam postera saecla ad se\r\npertinere? Saeclo_ = 'generation'. For mood of _prosint_ see A 317; G. 632,\r\nH. 497, I. -- STATIUS NOSTER: 'our fellow-countryman Statius'. So Arch. 22\r\n_Ennius noster_. Caecilius Statius, born among the Insubres, wrote Latin\r\ncomedies which were largely borrowed from the Greek of Menander. The\r\noriginal of the _Synephebi_ was Menander's Συνε φηβοι 'young comrades'. See\r\nSellar, Rom. Poets of the Rep., Ch. 7.\r\n\r\nP. 11. -- 25. DIS: the spellings _diis_, _dii_ which many recent editors\r\nstill keep, are probably incorrect, at all events it is certain that the\r\nnominative and ablative plural of deus formed monosyllables, except\r\noccasionally in poetry, where _dei_, _deis_ were used. Even these\r\n_dissyllabic_ forms scarcely occur before Ovid. -- ET: emphatic at the\r\nbeginning of a sentence: 'aye, and'. -- MELIUS: _sc. dixit_. -- ILLUD: 'the\r\nfollowing' A. 102, b, G. 292, 4; H. 450, 3. -- IDEM: _īdem_, not _ĭdem_. --\r\nEDEPOL: literally, 'ah, god Pollux', _e_ being an interjection, _de_ a\r\nshortened form of the vocative of _deus, pol_ abbreviated from _Pollux_.\r\nThe asseveration is mostly confined to comedy. The lines come from a play\r\nby Statius called Plocium (πλοκιον 'necklace'), copied from one by Menander\r\nwith the same title; see Ribbeck's 'Fragmenta' The verses are iambic\r\ntrimeters A. 365; G. 754, H. 622. -- NIL QUICQUAM: see n. on 21 _quemquam\r\nsenem_, cf. the common expression _nemo homo_, 84 _nemo vir_, etc. where\r\ntwo substantival words are placed side by side. -- VITI: see n. on 1, l 3\r\n_praemi Viti_ here = _mali_; cf. Ter. Andr. 73 _ei vereor ne quid Andria\r\nadportet mali_. -- SAT EST: _sat_ for _satis_ in Cicero's time was\r\nold-fashioned and poetical. -- QUOD DIU: these words must be scanned as a\r\nspondee. The _i_ in _diu_ here probably had the sound of our _y_. A. 347,\r\n_c_, G. 717; H. 608, III. n. 2. Allen well compares a line of Publilius\r\nSyrus _heu quam multa paenitenda incurrunt vivendo diu_. -- VOLT:\r\nindefinite subject. -- VIDET: Tischer quotes Herod. 1, 32 (speech of Solon\r\nto Croesus) εν γαρ τωι μακρωι χρονωι πολλα μεν εστιν ιδεειν, τα μη τις\r\nεθελει, πολλα δε και παθεειν. -- TUM EQUIDEM etc.: these lines, as well as\r\nthose above, occurred in a play of Statius called _'Ephesio'_ see Ribbeck's\r\n'Fragmenta'. -- SENECTA: not used by prose writers before the time of\r\nsilver Latin. -- DEPUTO: this compound is used by the dramatists and then\r\ndoes not occur again till late Latin times. -- EUMPSE: like _ipse_ and\r\n_reapse_ (for which see n. on Lael. 47) this word contains the enclitic\r\nparticle _pe_ (probably another form of _que_), found in _nem pe_,\r\n_quis-p-iam_ etc., along with _se_, which belongs to an old demonstrative\r\npronoun once declined _sos_, _sa_, _sum_, the masc. and fem. of which are\r\nseen in ‛ο, ‛η. The form was no doubt originally _eumpsum_, like _ipsom_\r\n(_ipsum_), but has passed into its present form just as _ipsos_ (nom.)\r\nbecame _ipso_, then _ipse_. The only difference in sense between _eumpse_\r\nand the simple _eum_ is that the former is more emphatic. The pronoun\r\n_eumpse_ is the subject of the infinitive _sentire_, but the substantive,\r\n_senex_, to which the pronoun refers, is not expressed. -- ODIOSUM: cf. n.\r\non 4.\r\n\r\n26. IUCUNDUM ... ODIOSUM: elliptic, = _'iucundum' potius quam 'odiosum'\r\nsenem esse dicendum est_. -- UT ... DELECTANTUR: cf. Lael. 101; also below,\r\n29. -- SAPIENTES SENES: neither of these words is used as an adjective\r\nhere; the whole expression = _sapientes, cum facti sunt senes_. -- LEVIOR:\r\ncf. the fragm. of Callimachus: γηρασκει δ' ‛ο γερων κεινος ελαφροτερον, τον\r\nκουροι φιλεουσι. -- COLUNTUR ET DILIGUNTUR: _colere_ rather implies the\r\nexternal marks of respect (cf. _coli_ in 7), _diligere_ the inner feeling\r\nof affection. -- PRAECEPTIS etc.: cf. Off. 1, 122 _ineuntis enim aetatis\r\ninscitia senum constituenda et regenda prudentia est_. -- ME ... IUCUNDOS:\r\nput for _me iucundum esse quam vos mihi estis iucundi_. The attraction of a\r\nfinite verb into the infinitive after _quam_ is not uncommon; cf. n. on 1\r\n_quibus me ipsum_ (Roby, 1784, _b_; A. 336, _b_, Rem.; H. 524, 1, 2).\r\n_Minus_, be it observed, does not qualify _intellego_, but _iucundos_. --\r\nSED: here _analeptic_, _i.e._ it introduces a return to the subject proper\r\nafter a digression, so in 31. -- VIDETIS, UT ... SIT: here _ut = quo modo_;\r\n'how'. -- SENECTUS ... CUIUSQUE: the abstract _senectus_ is put for _senes_\r\nas in 34; hence _cuiusque, sc. senis_. So above _adulescentia_ =\r\n_adulescentes_. -- AGENS ALIQUID: this phrase differs from _agat_ in that\r\nwhile the subjunctive would express the _fact_ of action, the participial\r\nphrase expresses rather the constant _tendency_ to act. _Agens aliquid_\r\nforms a sort of attribute to _senectus_, parallel with _operosa. Moliri_\r\ndiffers from _agere_ in that it implies the bringing into existence of some\r\nobject. Cf. Off. 3, 102 _agere aliquid et moliri volunt_; Acad. 2, 22 _ut\r\nmoliatur aliquid et faciat_; N.D. 1, 2 _utrum di nihil agant, nihil\r\nmoliantur_; Mur. 82 _et agant et moliantur_. -- QUID ... ALIQUID: for the\r\nellipsis in _quid qui_ cf. n. on 22 _quid ... Addiscunt_ = προμανθανουσι =\r\nlearn on and on, go on learning. -- UT ... VIDEMUS: put, as Allen observes,\r\nfor _ut Solon fecit, quem videmus_. -- SOLONEM: see also 50. The line\r\n(_versibus_ here is an exaggeration; in 50 it is _versiculus_) is preserved\r\nby Plato in his Timaeus and by Plutarch, Sol. 31 γαερασκο δ' αει πολλα\r\nδιδασκομενος. The age of Solon at his death is variously given as 80 or 100\r\nyears. -- VIDEMUS: the Latins frequently use 'we see' for 'we read'. See n.\r\non Lael. 39, also below, 69 _ut scriptum video_. -- GLORIANTEM: A. 292,\r\n_e_; G. 536, 527, Rem. 1; H. 535, I. 4. Notice the change to the infinitive\r\nin _uti_ below. -- SENEX: _i.e. cum senex essem_; so 27 _adulescens\r\ndesiderabam_; 30 _memini puer_. Plutarch (Cato 2) gives an account of\r\nCato's study of Greek in his old age. -- SIC: this word does not qualify\r\n_avide_, but refers on to _quasi_, so that _sic ... quasi cupiens_ = 'thus,\r\n_viz._ like one desiring'. Cf. n. on 12 _ita cupide fruebar quasi_; also 35\r\n_tamquam ... sic_. _Quasi_ serves to soften the metaphor in _sitim_; cf. n.\r\non Lael. 3. -- CUPIENS: after _quasi_ a finite verb _(cuperem)_ would have\r\nbeen more usual, as in 12 _ita ... quasi divinarem_. Cf. however 22 _quasi\r\ndesipientem_. -- EA IPSA MIHI: for the juxtaposition of pronouns, which is\r\nrather sought after in Latin, cf. 72 _ipsa suum eadem quae_. -- EXEMPLIS: =\r\n_pro exemplis_, or _exemplorum loco_ (cf. n. on 21 _Lysimachum_), so that\r\nthose editors are wrong who say that we have here an example of the\r\nantecedent thrust into the relative clause, as though _ea ipsa quibus\r\nexemplis_ were put for _ea ipsa exempla quibus_. -- QUOD: = _ut cum iam\r\nsenex esset disceret_. -- SOCRATEN: Cic. probably learned this fact from\r\nPlato's Menexenus 235 E and Euthydemus 272 C where Connus is named as the\r\nteacher of Socrates in music. In the Euthydemus Socrates says that the boys\r\nattending Connus' lessons laughed at him and called Connus\r\nγεροντοδιδασκαλον. Cf. also Fam. 9, 22, 3 _Socraten fidibus docuit\r\nnobilissimus fidicen; is Connus vocitatus est_; Val. Max. 8, 7, 8. -- IN\r\nFIDIBUS: 'in the case of the lyre'. Tücking quotes Quintilian 9, 2, 5 _quod\r\nin fidibus fieri vidimus_. The Greek word _cithara_ is not used by Cicero\r\nand does not become common in Latin prose till long after Cicero's time,\r\nthough he several times uses the words _citharoedus, citharista_, when\r\nreferring to Greek professional players. The word _lyra_ too is rare in\r\nearly prose; it occurs in Tusc. 1, 4 in connection with a Greek, where in\r\nthe same sentence _fides_ is used as an equivalent. -- AUDIREM: for _audire\r\n= legendo cognoscere_ see n. on 20. -- VELLEM: _sc. si possem_. --\r\nDISCEBANT ... ANTIQUI: doubts have been felt as to the genuineness of the\r\nclause. In Tusc. 4, 3 a passage of Cato is quoted which refers to the use\r\nof the _tibia_ among the ancient Romans; immediately afterwards the\r\nantiquity of practice on the _fides_ at Rome is mentioned, though not\r\nexpressly on Cato's authority. The words cannot be said to be unsuited\r\neither to the person or to the occasion. -- DISCEBANT ... FIDIBUS: the verb\r\n_canere_, which means 'to play' as well as 'to sing', must be supplied;\r\n_fidibus_ is then an ablative of the means or instrument. There is the same\r\nellipsis of _canere_ in the phrases _docere fidibus_ (Fam. 9, 22, 3) and\r\n_scire fidibus_ (Terence, Eunuchus 133). Cf. Roby, 1217.\r\n\r\nP. 12. -- 27. NE ... QUIDEM: these two words together correspond to the\r\nGreek ουδε (ου = ne, δε = quidem), and are best translated here by 'nor'\r\nrather than by 'not even'. The rendering 'not even', though required by\r\nsome passages, will often misrepresent the Latin. -- LOCUS: _locus_ (like\r\nτοπος in Greek) is a rhetorical term with a technical meaning. The pleader\r\nis to anticipate the arguments he may find it necessary to use in different\r\ncases, and is to arrange them under certain heads; each head is called a\r\nτοπος or _locus_, meaning literally the _place_ where a pleader is to look\r\nfor an argument when wanted. Hence _locus_ came to mean 'a cut-and-dried\r\nargument' or, as here, a 'commonplace'. It is often found in Cicero's\r\nrhetorical writings. -- NON PLUS QUAM: 'any more than'. After the negative\r\n_ne_ above it is incorrect to translate _non_ by a negative in English,\r\nthough the repetition of the negative is common enough in Latin, as in some\r\nEnglish dialects. Cf. n. on 24. _Plus_ here = _magis_. -- QUOD EST: _sc.\r\ntibi_, 'what you have', so Paradoxa 18 and 52 _satis esse, quod est_. --\r\nAGAS: _quisquis_ is generally accompanied by the indicative, as in Verg.\r\nAen. 2, 49 _quidquid id est_ etc.; see Roby, 1697; A. 309, _c_; G. 246, 4;\r\nH. 476, 3. The subjunctive is here used, with the imaginary second person,\r\nto render prominent the hypothetical and indefinite character of the verb\r\nstatement. Roby, 1544-1546; Madvig, 370, 494, Obs. 5, (6). -- VOX:\r\n'utterance'; the word is used only of speeches in some way specially\r\nremarkable. -- CONTEMPTIOR: 'more despicable'. The passive participle of\r\n_contemno_ has the sense of an adjective in -_bilis_, like _invictus_ and\r\nmany others. -- MILONIS: the most famous of the Greek athletes. He lived at\r\nthe end of the sixth century B.C., and the praises of his victories were\r\nsung by Simonides. It was under his leadership that his native city Croton,\r\nin Magna Graecia, attacked and destroyed Sybaris. Many stories are told by\r\nthe ancients about his feats of strength (see 33), and about his power of\r\nconsuming food. He is said to have been a prominent disciple of Pythagoras.\r\n-- ILLACRIMANS: beware of spelling _lacrima_ with either _ch_ for _c_ or\r\n_y_ for _i_; these spellings are without justification. The _y_ rests on\r\nthe absurd assumption that the Latins borrowed their word _lacrima_\r\nstraight from the Greek δακρυ. -- DIXISSE: combinations like _dicitur\r\ndixisse_ are exceedingly rare in good Latin. Cicero nearly always uses two\r\ndifferent verbs; _i.e._ he says _aiunt dicere_ and the like. -- AT: there\r\nis an ellipsis here such as 'those young men's muscles are powerful but\r\n...'. This elliptic use of _at_ is common in sudden exclamations of grief,\r\nannoyance, surprise etc. -- VERO: this is common in emphatic replies,\r\nwhether the reply convey assent, or, as here, a retort. The usage is well\r\nillustrated in Nägelsbach's Stilistik, § 197, 2. -- TAM: _sc. mortui sunt_.\r\n-- NUGATOR: _nugari_ = ληρειν, 'to trifle'. -- EX TE: Cato here identifies\r\na man's person with his soul and intellect, the body being regarded as a\r\nmere dress; cf. Rep. 6, 26 _mens cuiusque is est quisque_. _Ex te_,\r\nliterally, 'out of yourself', _i.e._ 'from your real self's resources'. --\r\nLATERIBUS: see n. on 14. -- AELIUS: his _cognomen_ was Paetus; he was\r\nconsul in 198, and censor in 194 B.C. He was one of the earliest and most\r\nfamous writers on Roman Law. His great commentary on the XII tables is\r\noften referred to by Cicero, who several times quotes Ennius' line about\r\nhim. -- _egregie cordatus homo catus Aelius Sextus_. -- TALE: _sc. dixit_.\r\n-- CORUNCANIUS: n. on 15. -- P. CRASSUS: consul in 205 B.C. with the elder\r\nAfricanus; pontifex maximus from 212 to his death in 183. He was famous\r\nboth as a lawyer (see below, 50; also Liv. 30, 1, 5 _iuris pontifici\r\nperitissimus_) and as a statesman (see 61). _Modo_ therefore covers a space\r\nof at least 33 years, so that it cannot well be translated by our 'lately';\r\nsay rather 'nearer our time'. The amount of time implied by _modo_ and\r\n_nuper_ depends entirely on the context; for _modo_ see Lael. 6 with note,\r\nfor _nuper_ below, n. on 61, where it is used of Crassus as _modo_ is here.\r\n-- PRAESCRIBEBANTUR: the meaning is that these lawyers practised in old age\r\nas jurisconsults, _i.e._ according to old Roman custom, they gave audience\r\nin the early hours of the day to all who chose to consult them about legal\r\ndifficulties. -- EST PROVECTA: literally 'was carried forward', _i.e._\r\n'continued', 'remained'. Some wrongly take the phrase to mean 'made\r\nprogress', 'increased', a sense which would require the imperfect,\r\n_provehebatur_. -- PRUDENTIA: here, as often, 'legal skill'.\r\n\r\n28. ORATOR: emphatic position. -- SENECTUTE: causal ablative; not 'in age',\r\nbut 'owing to age'. -- OMNINO -- SED TAMEN: 'no doubt -- but still'.\r\n_Omnino_ (literally, 'altogether') has two almost exactly opposite uses --\r\n(1) the affirmative, cf. 9; (2) the concessive, which we have here and in\r\n45. The circumstance which is contrasted with the admitted circumstance is\r\nusually introduced by _sed tamen_ or _sed_ as in 45, but in Lael. 98 by the\r\nless emphatic _autem_, while in Lael. 69 there is no introductory particle.\r\n-- CANORUM ... SENECTUTE: _canorum_ implies the combination of power with\r\nclearness in a voice. For the mixture of metaphors in _canorum splendescit_\r\nedd. quote Soph. Phil. 189 αχω τηλεφανης; Cic. De Or. 2, 60 _illorum tactu\r\norationem meam quasi colorari_. -- NESCIO QUO PACTO: literally, 'I know not\r\non what terms'; quite interchangeable with _nescio quo modo_; cf. 82. A.\r\n334, _e_; G. 469, Rem. 2; H. 529, 5, 3). -- ADHUC NON: purposely put for\r\n_nondum_, because more emphasis is thus thrown both on the time-word and on\r\nthe negation. The common view that _nondum_ was avoided because it would\r\nhave implied that Cato _expected_ to lose the _canorum_ is certainly wrong.\r\n-- ET VIDETIS: 'though you see my years'. The adversative use of _et_ for\r\n_autem_ or _tamen_ after the negative is not very uncommon in Cicero, but\r\nthere are few examples of the usage in the speeches. Cf. Lael. 26 _et\r\nquidquid_; so sometimes _que_ as above, 13; also Lael. 30 _ut nullo egeat\r\nsuaque omnia in se posita iudicet_. -- SENI: Madvig's em. for _senis_. In\r\nLeg. 1, 11 allusion is made to the great change which advancing years had\r\nwrought in Cicero's own impassioned oratory. He was no doubt thinking of\r\nthat change when he wrote the words we have here. -- SERMO: 'style of\r\nspeaking'; a word of wider meaning than _oratio_, which only denotes public\r\nspeaking. -- QUIETUS ET REMISSUS: 'subdued and gentle'. The metaphor in\r\n_remissus_ (which occurs also in 81) refers to the loosening of a\r\ntight-stretched string; cf. _intentum_ etc. in 37 with n. With the whole\r\npassage cf. Plin. Ep. 3, 1, 2 _nam iuvenes confusa adhuc quaedam et quasi\r\nturbata non indecent; senibus placida omnia et ordinata conveniunt_. --\r\nFACIT AUDIENTIAM: 'procures of itself a hearing for it'. In the words _per\r\nse ipsa_ there is no doubt an allusion to the custom at large meetings in\r\nancient times whereby the _praeco_ or κηρυξ called on the people to listen\r\nto the speakers. Cf. Liv. 43, 16, 8 _praeconem audientiam facere iussit_.\r\nNote that this is the only classical use of the word _audientia_; it has\r\nnot the meaning of our 'audience' either in the sense of a body of\r\nlisteners, or as used in the expression 'to give audience'. -- COMPOSITA ET\r\nMITIS: 'unimpassioned and smooth'. Cf. Quintil. 6, 2, 9 _affectus igitur\r\nhos concitatos, illos mitis atque compositos esse dixerunt_. -- QUAM ...\r\nNEQUEAS: 'and if you cannot practise oratory yourself'. Evidently _quam_\r\nrefers to _oratio_ in the widest sense, not to the special style of oratory\r\nmentioned in the last sentence. With _si nequeas_ cf. _nisi exerceas_ in 21\r\nwith n. -- SCIPIONI ET LAELIO: '_a_ Scipio and _a_ Laelius'; _i.e._ 'young\r\nfriends such as Scipio and Laelius are to me'. -- PRAECIPERE: here\r\nabsolute, = _praecepta dare_; usually an accusative follows. -- STUDIIS\r\nIUVENTUTIS: 'the zeal of youth'. _Studiis_ does not imply here the\r\ndeference of youth to age; the studia meant are the _virtutum studia_ of\r\n26.\r\n\r\n29. NE ... INSTRUAT: _docere_ is to impart knowledge, _instituere_\r\n(literally 'to ground' or 'establish') is to form the intellect and\r\ncharacter by means of knowledge, _instruere_, to teach the pupil how he may\r\nbring his acquirements to bear in practical life. -- OFFICI MUNUS:\r\n'performance of duty'; cf. 35, 72; Fam. 6, 14. In scores of passages in\r\nCicero we find _officium et munus_, 'duty and function', as in 34. -- CN.\r\nET P. SCIPIONES: in Cic. the plural is always used where two men of the\r\nsame family are mentioned and their names connected by et. In other writers\r\nthe plural is regular, the singular exceptional, as in Sall. Iug. 42, 1\r\n_Ti. et C. Gracchus_; Liv. 6, 22 _Sp. et L. Papirius_. Even with other\r\nnouns the plural is regular; e.g. Cic. Phil. 2, 101 _arationes Campana et\r\nLeontina_, though a little above we have _mense Aprili atque Maio_. [See\r\nDraeger, Hist. Synt. 1², p. 1.] Gnaeus (_not_ Cnaeus -- see n. on Lael. 3)\r\nCornelius Scipio was consul in 222 B.C. and was sent to Spain at the\r\noutbreak of the Second Punic war to command against Hasdrubal. Publius was\r\nconsul in 218, and after being defeated by Hannibal at the Ticinus, joined\r\nhis brother in Spain. At first they won important successes, but in 212\r\nthey were hemmed in and killed, after a crushing defeat. -- L. AEMILIUS:\r\nthe father of Macedonicus. He was consul in 219 and defeated the Illyrii;\r\nbut when consul again in 216 was defeated and killed at Cannae. See 75. For\r\n_avi duo_ cf. 82. -- CONSENUERINT ... DEFECERINT: _coniunctio_, for which\r\nsee n. on 16. For the mood see A. 313, _a_; G. 608; H. 515, III. and n. 3.\r\n-- ETSI: see n. on 2. -- SENECTUTE: MSS. and edd. have _senectutis_, but\r\nthe sense requires the abl.\r\n\r\nP. 13. -- 30. CYRUS: the elder. -- APUD XENOPHONTEM: 'in Xenophon'; so in\r\n79 where see n.; also 31 _apud Homerum_. See Cyropaedia, 8, 7, 6. -- CUM\r\n... ESSET: '_though_ he was very old', the clause depends on the following\r\nwords, not on the preceding. -- NEGAT: in Latin as in English the present\r\ntense is used in quotations from books. -- METELLUM: was consul in 251 B.C.\r\nand won a great victory over the Carthaginians at Panormus (Palermo);\r\nconsul again in 247. See below, 61. -- MEMINI ... ESSE: for the\r\nconstruction of _memini_ with the present or perfect infinitive, see n. on\r\nLael. 2; also A. 288, _b_; G. 277, Rem.; H. 537, 1. -- PUER: the expression\r\nis peculiar, being abbreviated from _quod puer vidi_ or something of the\r\nkind. Quintil. 8, 3, 31 has _memini iuvenis_. In Rep. 1, 23 Cicero says\r\n_memini me admodum adulescentulo_. -- VIGINTI ET DUOS: the commoner order\r\nof the words is _duos et viginti_; see n. on 13 _centum ... annos_. -- EI\r\nSACERDOTIO: 'that sacred college'; _i.e._ the pontifical college consisting\r\nof the _pontifex maximus_ and the inferior _pontifices_. -- REQUIRERET: see\r\nn. on 13 _quaereretur_. -- NIHIL: n. on 1, l. 1 _quid_. -- MIHI: dat. for\r\nacc. to emphasize the person. -- ID: 'such a course'; cf. 82 _ut de me ipse\r\naliquid more senum glorier_.\r\n\r\n31. VIDETISNE UT: here _ne_ is the equivalent of _nonne_, as it often is in\r\nthe Latin of Plautus and Terence, and in the colloquial Latin of the\r\nclassical period. For _ut_ after _videtis_ see n. on 26. -- NESTOR: _e.g._\r\nin Iliad 1, 260 _et seq_. 11, 668 _et seq_. -- TERTIAM AETATEM: cf. Iliad\r\n1, 250; Odyssey 3, 245. -- VERA ... SE: 'if he told the truth about\r\nhimself'. -- NIMIS: 'to any great extent'. _Insolens_ does not correspond\r\nto our 'insolent'; it is almost the equivalent of _ineptus_, and has no\r\nharsher meaning than 'odd', 'strange', 'in bad taste'. -- MELLE DULCIOR:\r\nHomer, Il. 1, 249 του και απο γλωσσης μελιτος γλυκιων ‛ρεεν αυδη. In Or. 32\r\nCic. says of Xenophon (whom the Greeks called Αττικη μελιττα) that his\r\n_oratio_ was _melle dulcior_. -- SUAVITATEM: notice the change from\r\n_dulcior_, which seems to be made for the mere sake of variety, since\r\nelsewhere (De Or. 3, 161) Cicero writes _dulcitudo orationis_. -- ET TAMEN:\r\nsee n. on 16. -- DUX ILLE: Agamemnon; see Iliad 2, 370 _et seq_. --\r\nNUSQUAM: _i.e._ nowhere in Homer. -- AIACIS: _i.e._ Aiax Telamonius, who\r\nwas the greatest Greek warrior while Achilles sulked (Iliad 2, 768). The\r\ngenitive after _similis_ is the rule in Cicero, though many examples of the\r\ndative are found even with names of persons; see Madv. on Fin. 5, 12.\r\n\r\n32. SED: see n. on 26. -- REDEO AD ME: so 45; Lael. 96, Div. 1, 97 _ad\r\nnostra iam redeo_; also below, 67 _sed redeo ad mortem impendentem._ --\r\nVELLEM: see n. on. 26. -- IDEM: A. 238; G. 331, Rem. 2; H. 371, 2. -- QUOD\r\nCYRUS: see 30. -- QUEO: the verb _queo_ is rarely found without a negative,\r\n_possum_ being used in positive sentences; cf. however Lael. 71 _queant_,\r\nwhere see n. -- MILES etc.: see 10 above. -- FUERIM ... DEPUGNAVI: A. 336,\r\n_b_; G. 630, Rem. 1; H. 524, 2, 2. _Depugnavi_ = 'fought the war out', or\r\n'to the end'; cf. 38, _desudans; 44 devicerat_. -- ENERVAVIT: _enervare_ is\r\nliterally 'to take out the sinews'; cf. the expressions _nervos elidere_\r\n(Tusc. 2, 27) and _nervos incidere_ (Academ. 1, 35) both of which are used\r\nin a secondary or metaphorical sense. -- CURIA: = _senatus_. -- ROSTRA: cf.\r\nn. on 44 _devicerat_. -- FIERI: A. 331, _a_; G. 546, Rem. 1; H. 498, I. n.\r\n-- ESSE: emphatic, = _vivere_; see n. on 21. -- EGO VERO etc.: 'I however\r\nwould rather that my old age should be shorter than that I should be old\r\nbefore my time'. -- MALLEM: see n. on 26 _vellem_.\r\n\r\nP. 14. -- NEMO CUI FUERIM: cf. Plaut. Mercator 2, 2, 17 _quamquam negotium\r\nest, numquam sum occupatus amico operam dare_.\r\n\r\n33. AT: as in 21, where see n. -- T. PONTI CENTURIONIS: the centurions were\r\ngenerally men of powerful frame; cf. Veget. 2, 14 _centurio elegendus est,\r\nqui sit magnis viribus et procera statura_; Philipp. 8, 26 _centuriones\r\npugnaces et lacertosos_; Horat. Sat. 1, 6, 72. -- MODERATIO: 'a right\r\napplication'; literally 'a governing'. -- TANTUM ... NITATUR: cf. 27\r\n_quidquid agas agere pro viribus_, also 434 _quantum possumus_. -- NE: the\r\naffirmative _ne_, often wrongly written _nae_ on the absurd assumption that\r\nthe word passed into Latin from the Greek ναι, is in Cicero always and in\r\nother writers nearly always followed by a pronoun. For the form of the\r\nsentence here cf. Fam. 7, 1, 3 _ne ... nostrum_; Tusc. 3, 8 _ne ista_ etc.;\r\nFin. 3, 11 (almost the same words). -- PER STADIUM: 'over the course'; cf.\r\nAthenaeus 10. 4, p. 412 E; Lucian, Charon, 8; Quint. 1, 9, 5 _Milo quem\r\nvitulum_ _assueverat ferre, taurum ferebat_. As to Milo see n. on 27. For\r\n_cum sustineret_ a modern would have been inclined to use a participle,\r\nwhich was perhaps avoided here because of the close proximity of another\r\nparticiple, _ingressus_. -- UMERIS: this spelling is better than _humeris_,\r\nwhich is now abandoned by the best scholars. There is no sound\r\ncorresponding to the _h_ in words of the same origin in cognate languages\r\n(see Curtius, Greek Etym. 1, 423 of the Eng. Trans.), and although\r\nundoubtedly _h_ was wrongly attached to some Latin words, there is no\r\nevidence to show that this happened to _umerus_. -- HAS: _i.e. Milonis_,\r\ncorresponding to _Pythagorae_. -- PYTHAGORAE: chosen no doubt because\r\ntradition made Milo a Pythagorean; see n. on 27. -- MALIS: _i.e. si\r\noptandum sit_ (cf. Plaut. Miles 170). For the ellipsis see n. on 26. --\r\nDENIQUE: 'in short'. -- UTARE: the second person of the present subjunctive\r\nhortative is very rare, excepting when, as here, the command is general.\r\nHad the command been addressed to a particular person, Cicero might have\r\nwritten _ne requisieris_. Cf. Madvig, Opusc. 2, 105; Roby, 1596; A. 266,\r\n_a, b_; G. 256, 2; H. 484, 4, n. 2. -- DUM ADSIT, CUM ABSIT: as both _dum_\r\nand _cum_ evidently have here a temporal sense, the subjunctives seem due\r\nto the influence of the other subjunctives _utare_ and _requiras_. A. 342;\r\nG. 666; H. 529, II. and n. 1, 1). -- NISI FORTE: see n. on 18. -- CURSUS:\r\nfor the metaphor cf. n. on 83; also Fam. 8, 13, 1 (a letter of Coelius)\r\n_aetate iam sunt decursa_; pro Quint. 99 _acta aetas decursaque_. For\r\n_certus_ cf. below, 72 _senectutis certus terminus_. -- AETATIS: here =\r\n_vitae_; see n. on 5. -- EAQUE: this is a common way of introducing with\r\nemphasis a fresh epithet or predicate. Often _idque_ (και τουτο) occurs,\r\nthe pronoun being then adverbially used, and not in agreement with the\r\nsubject. Cf. n. on 65 _illius quidem_; also _neque ea_ in 22. -- SIMPLEX:\r\nlife is compared to a race, in which each man has to run once and only once\r\naround the course. -- TEMPESTIVITAS: 'seasonableness'; cf. 5 _maturitate\r\ntempestiva_, with n. -- INFIRMITAS: the context shows that not physical but\r\nintellectual weakness is meant; so in Acad. 2, 9 _infirmissimo tempore\r\naetatis_; Fin. 5, 43 _aetas infirma_. -- FEROCITAS: 'exultation', 'high\r\nspirit'. -- IAM CONSTANTIS AETATIS: _i.e._ middle age, the characteristic\r\nof which is _stability_; cf. 76 _constans aetas quae media dicitur_; also\r\n60; Tac. A. 6, 46 _composita aetas_. For _iam_ cf. Suet. Galb. 4 _aetate\r\nnondum constanti_; pro Caelio 41 _aetas iam corroborata_; Fam. 10, 3, 2\r\n_aetas iam confirmata_. -- MATURITAS: 'ripeness', _i.e._ of intellect or\r\njudgment. -- SUO: G. 295, Rem. 1; H. 449, 2.\r\n\r\n34. AUDIRE TE ARBITROR: 'I think that news reaches you'. -- HOSPES: see n.\r\non 28 _orator_. -- AVITUS: there was a strong friendship between the elder\r\nAfricanus and Masinissa, king of Numidia, who in 206 B.C. passed over from\r\nthe Carthaginian alliance to that of the Romans. He was richly rewarded by\r\nScipio, and remained loyal to Rome till his death. He lived to welcome the\r\nyounger Scipio in Africa during the last Punic war, and to see the utter\r\nruin of Carthage. See Sall. Iug. 5, 4. For the expression _hospes tuus\r\navitus_ cf. Plautus, Miles 135 _paternum suom hospitem_. -- CUM INGRESSUS\r\netc.: _i.e._ protracted exercise of one kind did not weary him. -- CUM ...\r\nEQUO: though Cic. says _in equo vehi, esse, sedere_ etc. the preposition\r\nhere is left out because a mere ablative of manner or means is required to\r\nsuit the similar ablative _pedibus_. So Div. 2, 140 _equus in quo vehebar_,\r\n'the horse on which I rode'; but ib. 1, 58 _equo advectus ad ripam_,\r\n'brought to the bank _by the aid_ of a horse'. -- SICCITATEM: 'wiriness',\r\nliterally 'dryness' or freedom from excessive perspiration, colds and the\r\nlike; cf. Tusc. 5, 99 _siccitatem quae consequitur continentiam in victu_;\r\nCatull. 23, 12 _corpora sicciora cornu_. -- REGIS: here = _regia_. --\r\nOFFICIA ET MUNERA: see n. on 29. -- NE SINT: 'grant that age has no\r\nstrength'. This formula of concession for argument's sake is frequent in\r\nCicero, who often attaches to it _sane_. A. 266, _d_; G. 610; H. 515, III.\r\n-- SENECTUTE = _senibus_: see n. on 26. -- LEGIBUS ET INSTITUTIS: 'by\r\nstatute and precedent'. -- MUNERIBUS EIS etc.: chiefly military service. --\r\nNON MODO ... SED NE QUIDEM: when a negative follows _non modo_ these words\r\nhave the force of _non modo non_, a negative being borrowed from the\r\nnegative in the subsequent clause. But often _non modo non_ is written; the\r\nnegative after modo is then more emphatic, being independent. Here _non\r\nmodo non quod non_ would have had a harsh sound. A. 149, _e_; G. 484, 3 and\r\nRem. 1.; H. 552, 2. -- QUOD: adv. acc. (see n. on 1 _quid_). Cf. Liv. 6, 15\r\n_sed vos id cogendi estis_.\r\n\r\n35. AT: as in 21, where see n. In his reply Cato adopts the same form as\r\nthat in which the objection is urged, _at id quidem_ etc. So in 68 _at\r\nsenex ... at est ..._\r\n\r\nP. 15. -- COMMUNE VALETUDINIS: 'common to weak health', i.e. to all in a\r\nweak state of health. _Valetudo_ means in itself neither good nor bad\r\nhealth; the word takes its coloring from the context. -- FILIUS IS QUI: a\r\npause must be made at _filius_; the sense is not 'that son of Africanus who\r\nadopted you', but 'the son of Africanus, I mean the man who adopted you'.\r\n-- QUOD NI ITA FUISSET: 'now if this had not been so'; a phrase like _quod\r\ncum ita sit_ and _hoc ita dici_. Cf. also 67 _quod ni ita accideret_; 82\r\n_quod ni ita se haberet_. -- ALTERUM ... CIVITATIS: _illud_ is put for\r\n_ille_, by attraction to _lumen_. Roby, 1068. A. 195, _d_; G. 202, Rem. 5;\r\nH. 445, 4. Cf. Fin. 2, 70 _Epicurus, hoc enim vestrum lumen est_,\r\n'Epicurus, for _he_ is your shining light'. -- VITIA: 'defects'. --\r\nDILIGENTIA: scarcely corresponds to our 'diligence'; it rather implies\r\nminute, patient attention; 'painstaking'.\r\n\r\n36. HABENDA ... VALETUDINIS: 'attention must be paid to health'; so\r\n_valetudini consulere_ (Fam. 16, 4, 3) _operam dare_ (De Or. I, 265)\r\n_indulgere_ (Fam. 16, 18, 1) _valetudinem curare_ often; cf. also Fam. 10,\r\n35, 2; Fin. 2, 64. -- TANTUM: restrictive, = 'only so much'; so in 69, and\r\noften. -- POTIONIS: _cibus et potio_ is the regular Latin equivalent for\r\nour 'food and drink'; see below, 46; also Tusc. 5, 100; Fin. 1, 37; Varro\r\nde Re Rust. 1, 1, 5. -- ADHIBENDUM: _adhibere_ has here merely the sense of\r\n'to employ' or 'to use'. Cf. Fin. 2, 64. -- NON: we should say 'and not' or\r\n'but not'; the Latins, however, are fond of _asyndeton_, called\r\n_adversativum_, when two clauses are contrasted. -- MENTI ... ANIMO:\r\nproperly _mens_ is the intellect, strictly so called, _animus_ intellect\r\nand feeling combined, but the words are often very loosely used. They often\r\noccur together in Latin; Lucretius has even _mens animi_. -- INSTILLES: see\r\nn. on 21 _exerceas_. -- ET: 'moreover'. -- EXERCITANDO: in good Latin the\r\nverb _exercitare_ is rare except in _exercitatus_, which stands as\r\nparticiple to _exerceo, exercitus_ being unused. The word seems to have\r\nbeen chosen here as suiting _exercitationibus_ better than _exercendo_\r\nwould. So in 47 _desideratio_ is chosen rather than _desiderium_, to\r\ncorrespond with the neighboring _titillatio_. -- AIT: _sc. esse_; the\r\nomission with _aio_ is rare, though common with _dico, appello_ etc.; see\r\nn. on 22. -- COMICOS: not 'comic' in our sense, but = _in comoediis_,\r\n'represented in comedy'. So Rosc. Am. 47 _comicum adulescentem_, 'the young\r\nman of comedy'. The passage of Caecilius (see n. on 24 _Statius_) is more\r\nfully quoted in Lael. 99. -- CREDULOS: in almost every Latin comedy there\r\nis some old man who is cheated by a cunning slave. -- SOMNICULOSAE: the\r\nadj. contains a diminutive noun stem (_somniculo-_). -- PETULANTIA:\r\n'waywardness'. -- NON PROBORUM: Cic. avoids _improborum_ as being too\r\nharsh; with exactly similar feeling Propertius 3, 20, 52 (ed. Paley) says\r\n_nec proba Pasiphae_ for _et improba P._ Cf. Off. 3, 36 _error hominum non\r\nproborum_. -- ISTA: implying contempt. A. 102, _c_; G. 291, Rem.; H. 450,\r\n1. n. and foot-note 4. -- DELIRATIO: 'dotage'; a rare word, used by Cic.\r\nonly here and in Div. 2, 90.\r\n\r\n37. ROBUSTOS: 'sturdy'; implying that the sons were grown up. -- TANTAM:\r\n_sc. quantam habuit_; only a little more emphatic than _magnam_ would have\r\nbeen; see n. on 52. -- APPIUS: see n. on 16. -- REGEBAT: the _pater\r\nfamilias_ in early Roman times was an almost irresponsible ruler over his\r\nchildren and household. For a full discussion of the _patria potestas_ see\r\nCoulanges, Ancient City, Bk. II. Ch. 8; Maine, Ancient Law, Ch. 5; Hadley,\r\nIntrod. to Roman Law, Chapters 5 and 6. -- ET ... SENEX: 'though both blind\r\nand old'. -- INTENTUM: commonly used of _animus_, like the opposite\r\n_remissus_ (28). -- TENEBAT etc.: the _patria potestas_ is often denoted by\r\nthe word _imperium_; cf. De Invent. 2, 140 _imperium domesticum_. --\r\nVIGEBAT etc.: 'in him ancestral spirit and principles were strong'. While\r\n_animus patrius_ here evidently means the strong will for which the\r\npatrician Claudii were proverbial (as _e.g._ in Rosc. Am. 46 _intellegere\r\nqui animus patrius sit in liberos_) it indicates the feeling of a\r\nparticular father for his children.\r\n\r\nP. 16. -- 38. ITA: = _ea lege_ 'on these conditions, viz. ...', the clause\r\nwith _si_ being an explanation of _ita_. This correspondence of _ita ...\r\nsi_ is common in Cicero; see n. on 12 _ita ... quasi_. Here translate 'age\r\ncan only be in honor if it fights for itself'. -- SE IPSA: cf. Cic. Acad.\r\n2, 36 _veritas se ipsa defendet_; see also the n. on 4. -- SI ... EST: 'if\r\nit has passed into bondage to nobody'. _Mancipium_ is a piece of property;\r\n_emancipare_ is to pass a piece of property out of its owner's hands. The\r\nword acquired two exactly opposite meanings. When used of a slave, or of a\r\nson _in patria potestate_, who was legally subject to many of the same\r\nordinances as a slave, it means 'to set free', unless, as in Fin. I, 24\r\n_filium in adoptionem D. Silano emancipaverat_, some person is mentioned to\r\nwhom the original owner makes over his rights. But in Plaut. Bacchid. 1, 1,\r\n90 _mulier, tibi me emancupo_ the sense is 'I enslave myself to you',\r\n_i.e._ 'I pass myself out of my own power into yours'. So in the well-known\r\npassage of Horace, Epod. 9, 12 (of Antony) _emancipatus feminae_ 'enslaved\r\nto a woman'; cf Cic. Phil. 2, 51 _venditum atque emancipatum tribunatum_.\r\n-- SENILE ALIQUID ... ALIQUID ADULESCENTIS: chiasmus. For the sense cf. 33\r\n_ferocitas iuvenum ... senectutis maturitas_. -- QUOD QUI SEQUITUR: 'and he\r\nwho strives after this', _i.e._ to combine the virtues of age and youth.\r\nCf. Aesch. Sept. 622 γεροντα τον νουν σαρκα δ' ‛ηβωσαν φυει -- MIHI ... EST\r\nIN MANIBUS: 'I have on hand', 'am busy with'. Cf. n. on 22. -- ORIGINUM: as\r\nto Cato's literary labors see Introd. -- OMNIA COLLIGO: referring to the\r\nmaterials Cato was collecting for his 'Origines'. -- QUASCUNQUE DEFENDI:\r\n'as many as I have conducted'. _Defendere causam_ here is simply to act as\r\ncounsel in a case, whether the client be defendant or plaintiff. So in\r\nLael. 96 and often. -- NUNC CUM MAXIME: 'now more than ever', νυν μαλιστα.\r\nThe phrase is elliptic; in full it would be '_cum maxime conficio\r\norationes, nunc conficio_', 'when I most of all compose speeches, I now\r\ncompose them'; _i.e._ 'the time when I most of all compose is now'. The\r\nwords _cum maxime_ generally follow _tum_ or _nunc_ and add emphasis to\r\nthose words, but are sometimes used alone to express the ideas 'then' and\r\n'now' more emphatically than _tum_ and _nunc_ would. Cf. Ver. 4, 82; Tac.\r\nAnn. 4, 27. The orators were in the habit of working over their speeches\r\ncarefully for publication and preservation. -- IUS AUGURIUM etc.: 'the law\r\npertaining to the augurs and pontifices'; _i.e._ the principles applied by\r\nthem in the performance of their duties. The pontifices had the general\r\noversight of religious observances. See Dict. of Antiq. -- CIVILE: the\r\nmeaning of _ius civile_ varies according to the context. Here it is the\r\nsecular law as opposed to the sacred law, as in 50; sometimes it is the\r\nwhole body of Roman law as opposed to the law of other states; often,\r\nagain, it is the older portion of the Roman law as opposed to the newer or\r\n'equity' portion. -- COMMEMORO: 'I say over to myself'. In Cicero\r\n_commemoro_ is a verb of speaking, and never has the meaning of _recordor_\r\nor _memini_. -- CURRICULA: see nn. on 33. -- MAGNO OPERE: better so written\r\nthan in one word _magnopere_; so _maximo, minimo, nimio opere_. -- ADSUM\r\nAMICIS: 'I act as counsel to my friends'. This legal sense of _adesse_ is\r\ncommon. -- FREQUENS: literally the word means 'crowded' (connected with\r\n_farcire_ 'to cram' or 'to crowd together'), hence _frequens senatus_ and\r\nthe like phrases. Then _frequens_ comes to be used of actions or events\r\nthat often recur; _e.g._ Orat. 15 _Demosthenes frequens Platonis auditor_;\r\nDe Or. 1, 243 _frequens te audivi_. On the use of the adj. here see A. 191;\r\nG. 324, Rem. 6; H. 443. -- ULTRO: 'unasked', 'of my own motion', a\r\nreference to the well-known story that, whatever subject was discussed,\r\nCato gave as his opinion '_delenda est Carthago_'. See Introd. -- TUEOR:\r\n'advocate', 'support'. -- LECTULUS: a couch usually stood in the Roman\r\nstudy, on which the student reclined while reading, composing or dictating,\r\nor even writing. Cf. De Or. 3, 17, _in eam exedram venisse in qua Crassus\r\nlectulo posito recubuisset, cumque eum in cogitatione defixum esse\r\nsensisset, statim recessisse ..._; Suet. Aug. 78 _lecticula lucubratoria_.\r\n-- EA IPSA COGITANTEM: = _de eis ipsis cog._: so Acad. 2, 127 _cogitantes\r\nsupera atque caelestia_, and often. -- ACTA VITA: 'the life I have led';\r\ncf. 62 _honeste acta superior aetas_; so Tusc. 1, 109; Fam. 4, 13, 4. --\r\nVIVENTI: dative of reference. A. 235; G. 354; H. 384, 4, n. 3. 'As regards\r\none who lives amid these pursuits and tasks'. -- ITA SENSIM etc.: _sensim\r\nsine sensu_ (observe the alliteration) is like _mentes dementis_ in 16,\r\nwhere see n. _Sensim_ must have meant at one time 'perceptibly', then 'only\r\njust perceptibly', then 'gradually' and almost 'imperceptibly'.\r\n\r\n39. QUOD ... DICUNT: not strictly logical, being put for _quod careat, ut\r\ndicunt_. In cases like this the verb of saying is usually in the\r\nsubjunctive. Cf. Roby, 1746; A. 341, Rem.; G. 541, Rem. 2; H. 516, II. 1.\r\nThe indicative here is more vivid and forcible. -- MUNUS ... AUFERT: to say\r\nthat a gift robs one of anything is of course an _oxymoron_; cf. n. on 16\r\n_mentes dementis_. -- AETATIS: almost = _senectutis_: cf. n. on 45. -- ID\r\nQUOD EST etc.: 'the greatest fault of youth'; _i.e._ the love of pleasure.\r\nIn this passage _voluptas_ indicates pleasure of a sensual kind, its\r\nordinary sense, _delectatio, oblectatio_ etc. being used of the higher\r\npleasures. In 51, however, we have _voluptates agricolarum_. -- ACCIPITE:\r\n'hear'; so _dare_ often means 'to tell'. With _accipere_ in this sense cf.\r\nthe similar use of αποδεχεσθαι. -- ARCHYTAE: Archytas (the subject of\r\nHorace's well-known ode, 1, 28) was a contemporary and friend of Plato, and\r\na follower of the Pythagorean philosophy. He wrote philosophical works, and\r\nwas also famous as a mathematician and astronomer, besides being the\r\nleading statesman and general of the commonwealth of Tarentum. For another\r\nsaying of Archytas, cf. Lael. 88. -- TRADITA EST: 'was imparted to me',\r\n_i.e._ by word of mouth. -- CUM ... TARENTI: 'when as a young man I stayed\r\nat Tarentum'. For _adulescens_ cf. n. on 26 _senes_. -- NULLAM ... PESTEM\r\netc.: cf. Lael. 34 _pestem ... cupiditatem_; Off. 2, 9 _consuetudo ...\r\nhonestatem ab utilitate secernens, qua nulla pernicies maior hominum vitae\r\npotuit afferri_. -- CAPITALIOREM: 'more deadly'; _caput_ was often\r\nequivalent to _vita_, so that _capitalis_ comes to mean 'affecting the\r\nlife'.\r\n\r\nP. 17. -- 40. HINC etc.: cf. Cic. Hortensius fragm. _quod turpe damnum,\r\nquod dedecus est quod non evocetur atque eliciatur voluptate?_ Observe the\r\nsingular _patriae_ followed by the plural _rerum publicarum_; the plural of\r\n_patria_ is rare. On the significance of this passage see Lecky, Hist. of\r\nEuropean Morals, I. p. 211, n. (Am. ed.). -- CUM HOSTIBUS etc.: attributive\r\nphrase; cf. Phil. 12, 27 _colloquia cum acerrimis hostibus_. -- SCELUS:\r\nthis word looks chiefly to the criminal intention, whether it be carried\r\ninto action or not, _malum_, _facinus_ to the completed crime; _flagitium_\r\nis sin rather than crime, _Facinus_ in sense is often rather narrower and\r\nlighter than _scelus_; cf. Verr. 5, 170 _facinus est vincire civem Romanum,\r\nscelus verberare, prope parricidium necare_. -- IMPELLERET: _sc. homines_;\r\nso _nos_ is omitted after _iubebat_ below. -- EXCITARI: 'stirred up'. In 39\r\nand 41 we have the verb _in-citare_; for the difference between the two\r\nverbs cf. Qu. Fr. 1, 1, 45 _haec non eo dicuntur, ut te oratio mea\r\ndormientem excitasse, sed potius ut currentem incitasse videatur_. --\r\nHOMINI ... DEDISSET: cf. Acad. 1, 7 _nec ullum arbitror maius aut melius a\r\ndis datum munus homini_. Notice _homini_ 'man', in the same sense as\r\n_hominibus_, above. -- MUNERI AC DONO: the two words _munus_ and _donum_\r\nare often found together; the difference in meaning is hardly perceptible.\r\n_Donum_ implies the fact of giving, _munus_ the generosity of the giver. --\r\nTAM ... INIMICUM: notice the separation of _tam_ from _inimicum_.\r\n\r\n41. LIBIDINE: = επιθυμια; temperantia = σωφροσυνη. _Dominari_ is a very\r\nstrong word, 'to tyrannize'; _dominatio_ = τυραννις. For _locum_ cf. Lael.\r\n52 _in tyranni vita nullus locus est amicitiae_. -- CONSISTERE: 'find a\r\nfoothold'. Cf. Fin. 4, 69 _sapientia pedem ubi poneret non habebat_. --\r\nFINGERE ANIMO: 'to imagine'. -- TANTA ... QUANTA ... MAXIMA: 'the greatest\r\nthat could possibly be enjoyed'. The form of expression is common, _e.g._\r\nLael. 74 _tanta quanta maxima potest esse distantia_. -- TAM DIU DUM: this\r\nis not exactly equivalent to the ordinary _tam diu quam_, but there is\r\nellipsis -- 'so long as this, I mean while, etc.'. Cf. Cat. 3, 16 _tam diu,\r\ndum urbis moenibus continebatur_; Off. 1, 2 _tam diu ... quoad ..._ --\r\nMENTE ... RATIONE ... COGITATIONE: 'by thought, by reasoning, by\r\nimagination'. _Cogitatio_ like διανοια has often the sense of\r\n'imagination'. The close juxtaposition of words nearly synonymous is quite\r\ncharacteristic of Cicero's Latin. -- QUIDEM: concessive, as in 32 and\r\noften. -- MAIOR ATQUE LONGIOR: 'very intense and protracted'. Superlatives\r\nmight have been expected, in view of _quanta percipi posset maxima_ above.\r\n_Longus_ in the sense of 'long-continued' is rare in Ciceronian Latin,\r\nexcepting when, as in 66 _longa aetate_, it is joined with a word\r\ndistinctly referring to time. For the general drift of the passage cf. Cic.\r\nHortensius (fragment) _congruere cum cogitatione magna voluptas corporis\r\nnon potest; quis enim, cum utatur voluptate ea qua nulla possit maior esse,\r\nattendere animum, inire rationes, cogitare omnino quidquam potest_? --\r\nANIMI LUMEN: a common metaphor; _e.g._ Cic. Rep. 6, 12 _tu, Africane,\r\nostendas oportebit patriae lumen animi tui_. Cf. 36 _haec ...\r\nexstinguuntur_; also below, 42 _mentis oculos_. -- C. PONTIO: C. Pontius\r\nHerennius, the father of C. Pontius Telesinus who defeated the Romans at\r\nthe Caudine Forks during the Second Samnite war, in 321 B.C. The father is\r\nseveral times mentioned by Livy 9, cc. 1 and 3; cf. especially 1, § 2 _C.\r\nPontium, patre longe prudentissimo natum_. -- NEARCHUS: mentioned by\r\nPlutarch, Cato 2, as a Pythagorean and friend of Cato. -- PERMANSERAT:\r\n_i.e._ during the siege of Tarentum. -- INTERFUISSET: not in accordance\r\nwith English idiom; cf. n. on 4 _putassent_; also 44 _devicerat_. -- PLATO\r\netc.: although Plato made two journeys to Italy and Sicily (or, as some\r\nauthorities say, three) it is scarcely likely that he was present at\r\nTarentum in the year mentioned, 349 B.C., two years before his death, when\r\nhe was of advanced age. The latest date assigned by other authorities for\r\nPlato's last visit to the West is 361 B.C. -- REPERIO: _sc. in annalibus_;\r\nso in 15; cf. _videmus_ in 26.\r\n\r\n42. EFFICERET: _efficeret, liberet_, and _oporteret_ can be properly\r\nrendered into English only by the present tense. Although these verbs\r\nexpress circumstances which _continue_, since the general effect of old age\r\nis being described, they are thrown into the past to suit the past tense\r\n_dicebam_ or _dixi_ which, though not expressed, is really the principal\r\nverb. Cf. below, 62, 78. -- CONSILIUM: 'deliberation'.\r\n\r\nP. 18. -- UT ITA DICAM: this softens the metaphor, as _quasi_ or _quasi\r\nquidam_ often does, and as ‛οιον, ‛ωσπερ do in Greek [but not ‛ως επος\r\nειπειν, which is often wrongly said to be the equivalent of _ut ita dicam_;\r\nsee n. on Lael. 2]. The phrase _mentis_ or _animi aciem praestringere_\r\noften occurs without anything to soften the metaphor; _e.g._ Fin. 4, 37. --\r\nNEC HABET etc: 'and has no relations with virtue'. The use of _commercium_\r\nin the metaphorical sense is common. -- INVITUS: see ref. on 38 _frequens_.\r\n-- FECI UT: a periphrasis not unusual. A. 332, _e_; G. 557; H. 498, II. n.\r\n2. -- T. FLAMININI: see n. on 1, l. 1. -- L. FLAMININUM: as prætor he\r\ncommanded the fleet under his brother Titus during the Macedonian war; in\r\n192 B.C. he was consul. _Septem annis_ denotes seven _complete_ years (cf.\r\nn. on 19), as Cato was censor in 184. A reference to Livy 39, 43, 2 will\r\nshow that Cicero borrows his account of Flamininus' crime from the old\r\nannalist Valerius Antias. Livy also quotes (39, 42, 7) an account of the\r\nmatter given by Cato himself in a speech, which is even more disgraceful to\r\nFlamininus. -- EICEREM: the phrase commonly used is not _eicere_, but\r\n_movere, aliquem senatu. Notare_ and _nota (censoria)_ are technically used\r\nof degradation or disfranchisement inflicted by the censors. For the\r\nspelling see Roby, 144, 2; A. 10, _d_; H. 36, 4 and footnote 1. -- FUISSET:\r\nfor the mood see A. 342; G. 666; H. 529, II. and n. 1, 1); for the tense\r\nsee Roby, 1491; A. 324, _a_; G. 233, 2; H. 471, 4. -- CUM ... GALLIA: not\r\n'when he was consul in Gaul' but 'when he was in Gaul during his\r\nconsulship'. _Cum_ with the imperfect or pluperfect subjunctive often has a\r\nsense differing very little from that of _cum_ with the imperfect or\r\npluperfect indicative. No doubt when the usage originally arose, the clause\r\nwith _cum_ was regarded as expressing the _cause_ of the action or event\r\ndenoted by the principal verb; here the presence of F. in Gaul might be\r\nregarded as _a cause_ of the crime. It is more than doubtful, however,\r\nwhether in actual use the subjunctive in these phrases continued to carry\r\nwith it to Latin readers any idea of cause. See Roby, 1720, Kennedy, 211;\r\nalso A. 325, 323 and footnote 1; G. 586 with Rem.; H. 521, II. 2 and\r\nfootnote 1. -- EXORATUS EST: 'was persuaded'; cf. Liv. 39, 43. -- SECURI\r\nFERIRET: the story was that L. Flamininus himself acted as executioner. --\r\nEORUM QUI ... ESSENT: the subjunctive because of the class-notion, 'of such\r\npersons as were'. -- TITO CENSORE: _i.e._ in 189 B.C.; see n. on 1. --\r\nFLACCO: L. Valerius Flaccus was the life-long friend of Cato, and his\r\ncolleague in the consulship and in the censorship. He entirely favored\r\nCato's political views. See Introd. -- IMPERI DEDECUS: Flamininus was at\r\nthe time Roman governor of the district.\r\n\r\n43. AUDIVI E: Cic. uses _audire ex, ab_, and _de aliquo_, almost\r\nindifferently. -- PORRO: 'in turn'; literally 'farther on', here = 'farther\r\nback'; cf. Livy 27, 51. -- C. FABRICIUM: see n. on 15. -- CINEA: the famous\r\ndiplomatist, minister of Pyrrhus. He was a pupil of Demosthenes and himself\r\none of the most famous orators of his time. Cineas was the ambassador who\r\ntried to negotiate peace on the occasion mentioned in 16. -- SE SAPIENTEM\r\nPROFITERETUR: the omission of _esse_ is common in such phrases; _e.g._ Fin.\r\n5, 13 _Strato physicum se voluit_. Epicurus, who is here meant (born 342\r\nB.C., died 270), was blamed for calling himself σοφος or _sapiens_. Others,\r\nsays Cicero, who had borne the title had waited for the public to confer it\r\non them (Fin. 2, 7). -- EUMQUE: 'and yet he'; cf. n. on 13 _vixitque_. --\r\nFACEREMUS: for the tense cf. n. on 42 _efficeret_; also _expeteretur_\r\nbelow. -- AD ... REFERENDA: 'ought to be judged by the standard of\r\npleasure', _i.e._ anything which brings pleasure may be regarded as good,\r\nand its opposite bad. So in Greek επαναφερειν τι εις τι. On the moral\r\nteachings of Epicurus consult Zeller, Stoics, Epicureans, and Sceptics, Ch.\r\n19; Ueberweg, History of Philosophy, § 59; Guyan, La morale d'Épicure et\r\nses rapports avec les doctrines contemporaines. -- CURIUM ... CORUNCANIUM:\r\nsee n. on 15. -- ID ... PERSUADERETUR: intransitive verbs are used in the\r\npassive only impersonally (Roby, 1422; A. 230; G. 199, Rem. 1; H. 301, 1);\r\nwhen so used the dative may follow as in the active (see Madvig, 244, _b_;\r\nG. 208; H. 384, 5). A neuter pronoun in the singular sometimes, as here,\r\naccompanies the passive, and may be regarded as an adverbial accusative of\r\nrespect or extent, or as a nominative qualifying the impersonal subject.\r\nThe former is probably the real construction. Cf. Roby, 1423, and Madvig,\r\n229, _b_, Obs. 1. -- SAMNITIBUS: then in alliance with Pyrrhus. -- VIXERAT\r\n... CUM: not to be taken literally of living in the same house; the phrase\r\nmerely indicates close friendship. In Acad. 2, 115 Cic. writes _Diodoto qui\r\nmecum vivit tot annos, qui habitat apud me_, clearly showing that the\r\nphrases _vivere cum aliquo_ and _habitare apud aliquem_ are not equivalent.\r\n-- P. DECIO: this is P. Decius Mus, who at the battle of Sentinum in 295\r\ngave his life as a propitiatory offering to the powers of the unseen world,\r\nin order to bring victory to the Roman arms. His father had sacrificed\r\nhimself in the same way at the battle of Veseris (close to Vesuvius) in\r\n340, fought against the Latins and Campanians. -- DEVOVERAT: Liv. 10, 28,\r\n13 (speech of Decius) _datum hoc: nostro generi est ut luendis periculis\r\npublicis piacula simus; iam ego mecum hostium legiones mactandas Telluri et\r\ndis Manibus dabo_. -- ALIQUID etc.: 'some principle'; in his philosophical\r\nworks Cicero often confounds the Epicureans by quoting the action of the\r\nDecii and others like it, as showing that pleasure is not the end of\r\nexistence. Cf. especially Fin. 2, 61 _P. Decius cum se devoverat et equo\r\nadmisso in mediam aciem Latinorum irruebat, aliquid de voluptatibus suis\r\ncogitabat?_ Cf. also below, 75. With regard to _natura_ see n. on 5. -- SUA\r\nSPONTE: 'for its own sake'; 'on its own account'. Cf. Leg. 1, 45 _vera et\r\nfalsa sua sponte non aliena iudicantur_, where a few lines later _sua\r\nnatura_ occurs as equivalent to _sua sponte_. -- EX PETERETUR: em. for\r\n_peteretur_ in the MSS. The words _expetere_, _expetendum_ are technically\r\nused in Cicero's philosophical works to express the Greek ‛αιρεισθαι,\r\n‛αιρετον as applied to the _finis_ or τελος, the supreme aim of moral\r\naction. _Pulchrum_ above is a translation of the Greek καλον, a term\r\nconstantly applied to the τελος, particularly by the Stoics. -- SPRETA ET\r\nCONTEMPTA: the first word is much the stronger of the two; _spernere_ is\r\nκαταφρονειν, 'to scorn'; _contemnere_ ολιγωρεισθαι, 'to make light of',\r\n'hold of no account'. _Contemnere_ is often no stronger in sense than\r\n_omittere_, 'to pass by, neglect'. Cf. 65 _contemni_, _despici_. -- OPTIMUS\r\nQUISQUE: see A. 93, _c_; G. 305; H. 458, 1.\r\n\r\nP. 19. -- 44. CRUDITATE: 'indigestion'. -- INSOMNIIS: 'sleeplessness'; the\r\nsingular _insomnium_ occurs only once in prose (Tac. Ann. 11, 4).\r\n_Insomnia, ae_ is found only in poetry and late prose. -- DIVINE: this word\r\nin Cic. often means nothing more than 'splendidly', 'extraordinarily'. --\r\nESCAM MALORUM: 'an enticement to evil' (_esca_ = _ed-ca_, from the root of\r\n_edo_). Plato in the Timaeus 69 D (a dialogue translated into Latin by\r\nCicero, a fragment of whose translation is still preserved) has ‛ηδονην\r\nμεγιστον κακου δελεαρ. Cf. also Cic. Hortensius fr. 76 (ed. Halm)\r\n_voluptates corporis quae vere et graviter a Platone dictae sunt illecebrae\r\nesse atque escae malorum_. -- MODICIS: for the sake of variety Cic. chooses\r\nthis, not _moderatis_, as the opposite of _immoderatis_. Trans. 'a moderate\r\namount of goodfellowship'. -- M.F. = _Marci filium_. -- DEVICERAT:\r\npluperfect where a modern would incline to use a perfect. The battle\r\nreferred to is that of Mylae, fought in 260; its memory was perpetuated by\r\nthe decking of the _forum_ with the _rostra_ of the captured ships; the\r\n_columna rostrata_ bore a long inscription, a restored version of which\r\nstill exists. -- CENA: so best spelt; some good texts still print _caena_,\r\nbut _coena_ is decidedly wrong, being based on the fiction that the Latin\r\nborrowed the Greek word κοινη and turned it into _coena_. -- CEREO FUNALI:\r\n'the torch-light'; _cereo_, the em. of Mommsen for _crebro_; the _funale_\r\nwas a torch composed of withs or twigs twisted into a rope (_funis_) and\r\ndipped in pitch or oil. -- SIBI ... SUMPSERAT: Cic. seems to think that\r\nDuillius assumed these honors on his own authority. This was probably not\r\nthe case; they were most likely conferred on him by a vote of the _comitia\r\ntributa_. Cf. Liv. epit. 17 _C. Duillius primus omnium Romanorum ducum\r\nnavalis victoriae duxit triumphum, ob quam causam ei perpetuus quoque honos\r\nhabitus est, ut revertenti a cena tibicine canente funale praeferretur_. No\r\nother instance is known where these particular distinctions were decreed;\r\nthe nearest parallel lies in the right accorded to Paulus Macedonicus and\r\nto Pompeius to wear the triumphal _toga picta_ for life on each occasion of\r\nthe _ludi_. It may be conjectured that the music and the torch were part of\r\nthe ceremony on the evening of a triumph when the _triumphator_ was\r\nescorted home. Cf. Florus 1, 18, 10, ed. Halm. -- NULLO EXEMPLO: 'without\r\nany precedent'. -- PRIVATUS: any person is _privatus_ who is not actually\r\nin office at the moment referred to, whether he has led a public life or\r\nnot. -- LICENTIAE: a strong word is used to mark the heinousness of\r\nDuillius' supposed offence against ancestral custom.\r\n\r\n45. ALIOS: _sc. nomino_. -- PRIMUM: the corresponding _deinde_ is omitted,\r\nas often. -- SODALIS: the _sodalitates_ or _sodalitia_, brotherhoods for\r\nthe perpetuation of certain rites accompanied with feasting, were\r\nimmemorial institutions at Rome. The clause _sodalitates ... acceptis_ must\r\nnot be taken to mean that Cicero supposed these brotherhoods to have been\r\nfirst instituted in the time of Cato; it is only introduced to show that\r\nCato, so far from being averse to good living, assisted officially in the\r\nestablishment of new clubs. Most of the _sodalitates_ were closely\r\nconnected with the _gens_; all members of a _gens_ were _sodales_ and met\r\ntogether to keep up the old _sacra_, but in historical times fictitious\r\nkinship largely took the place of real kinship, and feasting became almost\r\nthe sole raison d'être of these clubs. [See Mommsen's treatise _De\r\ncollegiis et sodaliciis Romanis_] The parallel of the London City Companies\r\nreadily suggests itself. The national _sodalitates_ or priesthoods such as\r\nthose of the _Sodales Titii, Luperci, Augustales_ etc. were somewhat\r\ndifferent. -- AUTEM: for the form of the parenthesis cf. 7. -- MAGNAE\r\nMATRIS: the image of Cybele was brought to Rome in 204 B.C. from Pessinus\r\nin Phrygia. See Liv. 29, 10. The _Sacra_ are called _Idaea_ from Mount Ida\r\nin Phrygia, which was a great centre of the worship of Cybele. _Acceptis_,\r\nsc. _in civitatem_; the worship of strange gods was in principle illegal at\r\nRome unless expressly authorized by the State. -- IGITUR: the construction\r\nof the sentence is broken by the introduction of the parenthesis, and a\r\nfresh start is made with _epulabar igitur. Igitur_ is often thus used, like\r\nour 'well then', to pick up the broken thread of a sentence. So often _sed_\r\nor _ergo_. -- FERVOR: Cf. Hor. Od. 1, 16, 22 _me quoque pectoris temptavit\r\nin dulci iuventa fervor_. -- AETATIS, QUA PROGREDIENTE: 'belonging to that\r\ntime of life, but as life advances'. The word _aetas_ has really two senses\r\nhere; in the first place it is _bona aetas_ or _iuventus_ (cf. 39 where\r\n_aetas = senectus_), in the second place _vita_ (for which see n. on 5). --\r\nNEQUE ENIM: the _enim_ refers to _modice_. -- COETU ... SERMONIBUS: for the\r\norder of the words see n. on 1 _animi tui_. -- METIEBAR: cf. n. on 43\r\n_referenda_. -- ACCUBITIONEM: a _vox Ciceroniana_, rarely found in other\r\nauthors. -- VITAE CONIUNCTIONEM: 'a common enjoyment of life'. -- TUM ...\r\nTUM: here purely temporal, 'sometimes ... sometimes'; often however = 'both\r\n... and'; cf. 7. -- COMPOTATIONEM etc.: cf. Epist. ad Fam. 9, 24, 3.\r\n_Compotatio_ = συμποσιον; _concenatio_ = συνδειπνον. -- IN EO GENERE: see\r\nn. on 4. -- ID: _i.e._ eating and drinking.\r\n\r\n46. TEMPESTIVIS ... CONVIVIIS: 'even in protracted banquets'. Those\r\nbanquets which began _early_ in order that they might last long were\r\nnaturally in bad repute, so that the phrase _tempestivum convivium_ often\r\nhas almost the sense of 'a debauch'. Thus in Att. 9, 1, 3 Cicero describes\r\nhimself as being evil spoken of _in tempestivis conviviis, i.e._ in\r\ndissolute society. Cf. pro Arch. 13. The customary dinner hour at Rome was\r\nabout three o'clock in the afternoon. The word _tempestivus_, which in 5\r\nmeans 'at the right time', here means 'before the right time'. So in\r\nEnglish 'in good time' often means 'too early'. See Becker's Gallus, p. 451\r\n_et seq_. -- QUI PAUCI: the substitution of the nominative of the relative\r\nfor the partitive genitive (_quorum_) is not uncommon. A. 216, _e_; G. 368,\r\nRem. 2; H. 397, 2, n. -- PAUCI ADMODUM: Cic. usually says _admodum pauci_\r\nrather than _pauci admodum_. -- VESTRA AETATE: = _eis qui sunt vestra\r\naetate_. Cf. n. on 26 _senectus_. -- SERMONIS ... SUSTULIT: notice the\r\nindicatives _auxit, sustulit_, the relative clauses being attributive,\r\nthough they might fairly have been expected here to be causal. G. 627; H.\r\n517, 2. In this passage Cic. imitates Plato, Rep. 328 D. -- BELLUM\r\nINDICERE: common in the metaphorical sense; _e.g._ De Or. 2, 155 _miror cur\r\nphilosophiae prope bellum indixeris_; Hor. Sat. 1, 5, 7 _ventri indico\r\nbellum_. -- CUIUS EST etc.: _i.e._ nature sanctions a certain amount of\r\npleasure. This is the Peripatetic notion of the _mean_, to which Cicero\r\noften gives expression, as below, 77; also in Acad. 1, 39; 2, 139; and in\r\nDe Off.; so Hor. Sat. 1, 1, 106 _sunt certi denique fines quos ultra\r\ncitraque nequit consistere rectum_; cf. Od. 2, 10. -- NON INTELLEGO NE: for\r\nthe negatives cf. nn. on 24, 27.\r\n\r\nP. 20. -- MAGISTERIA: generally explained as referring to the practice of\r\nappointing at each dinner a 'master of the feast', _arbiter bibendi_ or\r\nσυμποσιαρχης. This explanation is not quite correct. Mommsen shows in his\r\nwork '_de collegiis_' that each one of the _collegia_ or _sodalicia_\r\nannually appointed a _magister cenarum_ whose duty it was to attend to the\r\nclub-dinners during his year of office and no doubt to preside at them.\r\nThat some office is meant more important than that of the _arbiter bibendi_\r\nappointed for a particular feast is shown by the words _a maioribus\r\ninstituta_. It is scarcely likely that Cicero was ignorant of the Greek\r\norigin of the custom of appointing an _arbiter bibendi_. -- ET IS SERMO\r\netc.: 'and the kind of talk in which following the fashion of our fathers\r\nwe engage, beginning at the upper table, as the cup goes round'. The cup\r\ncirculated from left to right, not, as with us, from right to left. The\r\nguests at a Roman dinner reclined on three couches, placed at three tables;\r\ntwo of the couches (_lecti_) were parallel, and the third was at right\r\nangles to the other two. The _lectus_ at which the cup began to circulate\r\nwas _summus_, the next _medius_, the last _imus_. For a _summo_ cf. _da\r\n(sc. bibere) a summo_ in Plaut. Asin. 5, 2, 41. See Becker's Gallus, p. 471\r\n_et seq_. -- SICUT ... EST: 'as we find'; so Off. 1, 32 _ut in fabulis\r\nest_, and often. -- IN SYMPOSIO: 2, 26. -- MINUTA: see n. on 52. --\r\nRORANTIA: here with an active sense, 'besprinkling', representing\r\nεπιψεκαζειν in Xenophon; often however not different in sense from\r\n_'roscida'_. -- REFRIGERATIO ... HIBERNUS: cf. closely 57 _ubi et seq_.\r\nNote the changes of expression in passing from _refrigeratio_ to _sol_\r\n(_apricatio_ would have more exactly corresponded with _refrigeratio_) and\r\nfrom _aestate_ to _hibernus_ (for _hieme_). -- IN SABINIS: 'when with the\r\nSabines', who were celebrated for their simplicity of life. Cato had an\r\nestate in the Sabine district. -- CONVIVIUM VICINORUM COMPLEO: 'I make up\r\n(_i.e._ to the proper number) a company of my neighbors'. -- QUOD ...\r\nPRODUCIMUS: 'and we continue our companionship to as late an hour as we\r\ncan, with changing talk'. The phrases _multa nocte_ or _de nocte_ 'late in\r\nthe night', _multo die_ 'late in the day', are common; cf. also Att. 13, 9,\r\n1 _multus sermo ad multum diem_; Rep. 6, 10 _sermonem in multam noctem\r\nproduximus_.\r\n\r\n47. AT: so in 21, where see n. -- QUASI TITILLATIO: the _quasi_, as often\r\nin Cicero's writings, marks a translation from the Greek. Here the\r\nEpicurean word γαργαλισμος is referred to; it is often in Cic. represented\r\nby _titillatio_; cf. N.D. 1, 113; Fin. 1, 39; Tusc. 3, 47. -- BENE: _sc.\r\ndixit_. -- AFFECTO AETATE: 'wrought on by age'. Cf. De Or. 1, 200 _in eius\r\ninfirmissima valetudine affectaque iam aetate_. -- UTERETURNE etc.:\r\n'whether he still took pleasure in love'; _uti = frui_. Cf. Ovid, Met. 4,\r\n259 _dementer amoribus uti_ with Cic. Tusc. 4, 68 _venereis voluptatibus\r\nfrui_. -- DI MELIORA: _sc. duint_; this archaic form usually occurs when\r\nthe phrase is given in full. The story of Sophocles is taken by Cicero from\r\nPlato (Rep. 329 B) who has ευφημει. -- ISTINC etc.: cf. the passage in\r\nPlato, Rep. 1, 329 C. For _istinc_ used otherwise than of place cf. _unde_\r\nin 12 with n. -- AGRESTI: 'boorish'; _rusticus_ denotes simply an ordinary\r\ncountryman. -- QUAMQUAM ... ERGO: these words may be scanned as a hexameter\r\nline, but the pause before _ergo_ would prevent them from being taken as a\r\nverse. -- HOC NON DESIDERARE: 'this absence of regret'; the words form the\r\nsubject of _est_. So _hoc non dolere_ in Fin. 2, 18. For the pronoun in\r\nagreement with the infinitive treated as noun cf. Persius 1, 9 _istud\r\nvivere_; 1, 122 _hoc ridere meum_. H. 538, 3.\r\n\r\n48. SI: 'even if', 'granting that'. -- BONA AETAS: 'the good time of life',\r\n_i.e._ youth. Tischer qu. Varro de Re Rustica 2, 6, 2 _mares feminaeque\r\nbona aetate_ = 'young'. For _bona aetas = homines bona aetate_ cf. n. on 26\r\n_senectus_. -- UT DIXIMUS: not expressly, but the opinion is implied in 44,\r\n45. -- TURPIONE AMBIVIO: L. Ambivius Turpio was the most famous actor of\r\nCato's time, and appeared especially in Terence's plays. In old Latin\r\ncommonly, occasionally in the Latin of the best period, and often in\r\nTacitus, the _cognomen_ is placed before the _nomen_ when the _praenomen_\r\nis not mentioned. Cf. Att. 11, 12, 1 _Balbo Cornelio_. The usage is more\r\ncommon in Cicero's writings than in those of his contemporaries. -- PRIMA\r\nCAVEA: 'the lower tier'. The later Roman theatres consisted of semicircular\r\nor elliptic galleries, with rising tiers of seats; the level space\r\npartially enclosed by the curve was the _orchestra_, which was bounded by\r\nthe stage in front. There can be little doubt that Cicero is guilty of an\r\nanachronism here; his words do not suit the circumstances of Cato's time.\r\nTill nearly the end of the Republic the theatres were rude structures of\r\nwood, put up temporarily; it is even doubtful whether they contained seats\r\nfor the audience. Cato himself frustrated an attempt to establish a\r\npermanent theatre. -- PROPTER: 'close by'. The adverbial use of _propter_\r\n(rarely, if ever, met with outside of Cicero) is denied by some scholars,\r\nbut is well attested by MSS. here and elsewhere. -- TANTUM ... EST: these\r\nwords qualify _delectatur_.\r\n\r\n49. ILLA: put for _illud_, as in Greek ταυτα and ταδε are often put for\r\nτουτο and τοδε. The words from _animum_ to the end of the sentence are\r\nexplanatory of _illa_. -- QUANTI: 'how valuable!' but the word may have\r\nexactly the opposite meaning if the context require it; thus in N.D. 1, 55\r\nand Rep. 6, 25 the sense is 'how worthless!' -- STIPENDIIS: 'campaigns'.\r\nThe four words from _libidinis_ to _inimicitiarum_ are to be taken in\r\npairs, while _cupiditatum_ sums them up and is in apposition to all. --\r\nSECUM ESSE: cf. Tusc. 1, 75; Pers. 4, 52 _tecum habita_. -- SI ... ALIQUOD:\r\nthe sense is scarcely different from that of _si ... quod_; the distinction\r\nis as slight as that in English between 'if' followed by 'some', and 'if'\r\nfollowed by 'any'. Cf. n. on Lael. 24 _si quando aliquid_. -- PABULUM: for\r\nthe metaphorical sense rendered less harsh by _tamquam_, cf. Acad. 2, 127;\r\nTusc. 5, 66 _pastus animorum_. -- STUDI: an explanatory genitive dependent\r\non _pabulum_. -- OTIOSA SENECTUTE: 'leisured age'; _otium_ in the Latin of\r\nCicero does not imply idleness, but freedom from public business and\r\nopportunity for the indulgence of literary and scientific tastes. --\r\nVIDEBAMUS: for the tense cf. Lael. 37 _Gracchum rem publicam vexantem ab\r\namicis derelictum videbamus, i.e._ 'we saw over a considerable period'. See\r\nalso 50, 79. -- IN STUDIO etc.: 'busied with the task of almost measuring\r\nbit by bit (_di-metiendi_) the heavens and the earth'. For the sense cf.\r\nHor. Od. 1, 28 (of Archytas). -- GALLUM: consul in 157 B.C., famous as an\r\nastronomer and as the first Roman who predicted an eclipse before the\r\nbattle of Pydna. See Liv. 44, 37.\r\n\r\nP. 21. -- DESCRIBERE: technically used of the drawing of mathematical\r\nfigures. _Ingredior_ often has an infinitive dependent on it even in the\r\nbest Latin; _e.g._ Cic. Top. 1 _nos maiores res scribere ingressos_.\r\n\r\n50. ACUTIS: requiring keenness of intellect. -- NAEVIUS: see n. on 20. --\r\nTRUCULENTO ... PSEUDOLO: these plays of Plautus (lived from 254 to 184\r\nB.C.) we still possess. The Truculentus is so named from one of the\r\ncharacters, a slave of savage disposition who is wheedled; the Pseudolus\r\nfrom a cheating slave. The latter name is commonly supposed to be a\r\ntranscription from a Greek word ψευδυλος, which however nowhere occurs; and\r\nas the change from Greek υ to Latin _o_ is not found before _l_, Corssen\r\nassumes ψευδαλος as the original word. The form _Pseudulus_ of the name is\r\nprobably later than _Pseudolus_. -- LIVIUM: Livius Andronicus, the founder\r\nof Latin literature (lived from about 285 to 204 B.C.), who translated the\r\nOdyssey, also many Greek tragedies. Livius was a Greek captured by Livius\r\nSalinator at Tarentum in 275 B.C.; for a time he was the slave of Livius,\r\nand, according to custom, took his name when set free. For an account of\r\nhis writings see Cruttwell's Hist. of Roman Literature, Ch. 3; Sellar,\r\nRoman Poets of the Rep., Ch. 3. -- DOCUISSET: 'had brought on to the\r\nstage'. _Docere_ (like διδασκειν in Greek, which has the same use) meant\r\noriginally to instruct the performers in the play. -- CENTONE TUDITANOQUE\r\nCONSULIBUS: _i.e._ in 240 B.C. The use of _que_ here is noticeable; when a\r\ndate is given by reference to the consuls of the year it is usual to insert\r\n_et_ (not _que_ or _atque_, which rarely occur) between the two names, if\r\nonly the _cognomina_ (as here) be given. If the full names be given, then\r\nthey are put side by side without _et_. Cf. n. on 10. -- CRASSI: see n. on\r\n27. -- PONTIFICI ET CIVILIS IURIS: the _ius pontificium_ regarded mainly\r\nthe proper modes of conducting religious ceremonial. _Ius civile_, which is\r\noften used to denote the whole body of Roman Law, here includes only the\r\nsecular portion of that Law. Cf. n. on 38. -- HUIUS P. SCIPIONIS: 'the\r\npresent P. Scipio'. So in 14 _hi consules_ 'the present consuls'; Rep. 1,\r\n14 _Africanus hic, Pauli filius_, and often. The P. Scipio who is meant\r\nhere is not Africanus, but Nasica Corculum. -- FLAGRANTIS: 'all aglow'; so\r\n_ardere studio_ in Acad. 2, 65. -- SENES: = _cum senes essent_, so _senem_\r\nbelow. -- SUADAE MEDULLAM: 'the essence (lit. marrow) of persuasiveness'.\r\nThe lines of Ennius are preserved by Cicero, Brut. 58. _Suada_ is a\r\ntranslation of πειθω, which the Greek rhetoricians declared to be the end\r\nand aim of oratory. This Cethegus was consul in 204 and in 203 defeated\r\nMago in the N. of Italy. -- EXERCERI: here reflexive in meaning. A. 111, n.\r\n1; G. 209; H. 465. -- VIDEBAMUS: see n. on 49. -- COMPARANDAE: for the idea\r\nof _possibility_ which the gerundive sometimes has (but only in negative\r\nsentences or interrogative sentences implying a negative answer, and in\r\nconditional clauses) see Madvig, 420, Obs.; Roby, 1403. -- HAEC QUIDEM: a\r\nshort summary of the preceding arguments, preparatory to a transition to a\r\nnew subject, introduced by _venio nunc ad_. The succession of two clauses\r\nboth containing _quidem_ seems awkward, but occurs in Fin. 5, 80 and\r\nelsewhere. -- HONESTUM SIT: 'does him honor'. -- UT ANTE DIXI: in 26, where\r\nsee the notes. -- POTEST ESSE: Meissner (n. on 27) says that Cicero's rule\r\nis to say _potest esse, debet esse_ and the like, not _esse potest_ and the\r\nlike. It is true that _esse_ in such cases is very seldom separated from\r\nthe word on which it depends, but _esse potest_ is just as common as\r\n_potest esse_; the difference to the sense is one of emphasis only, the\r\n_esse_ having more emphasis thrown on it in the latter case.\r\n\r\n51. MIHI ... VIDENTUR: see Introd. -- HABENT RATIONEM CUM 'they have their\r\nreckonings with', 'their dealings with'; a phrase of book-keeping. --\r\nIMPERIUM: so Verg. Georg. 1, 99 _exercetque frequens tellurem atque imperat\r\nagris_; ib. 2, 369 _dura exerce imperia et ramos compesce fluentes_; Tac.\r\nGerm. 26 _sola terrae seges imperatur._ -- SED ALIAS ... FAENORE: put for\r\n_sed semper cum faenore, alias minore, plerumque maiore_. -- VIS AC NATURA:\r\n'powers and constitution'. These two words are very often used by Cic.\r\ntogether, as in Fin. 1, 50 _vis ac natura rerum_. -- GREMIO: so Lucret. 1,\r\n250 _pereunt imbres ubi eos pater aether In gremium matris terrai\r\npraecipitavit_, imitated by Verg. Georg. 2, 325. -- MOLLITO AC SUBACTO:\r\n_i.e._ by the plough. _Subigere_, 'subdue', is a technical word of\r\nagriculture; so Verg. Georg. 2, 50 _scrobibus subactis_; see also below,\r\n59.\r\n\r\nP. 22. -- OCCAECATUM: 'hidden'. _Caecus_ has the sense of 'unseen' as well\r\nas that of 'unseeing' or 'blind'. -- OCCATIO: Cicero's derivation, as well\r\nas Varro's (De Re Rust. 1, 31, 1) from _occidere_, because the earth is cut\r\nup, is unsound. _Occa_ is _rastrum_, probably from its _sharp_ points (root\r\n_ak-_); _occatio_ therefore is 'harrowing'. -- VAPORE: 'heat'. This word\r\nhas not in the best Latin the meaning of our 'vapor'. -- COMPRESSU: a word\r\nfound only here in Cicero's writings and elsewhere in Latin only in the\r\nablative case, like so many other nouns whose stem ends in _-u_. --\r\nDIFFUNDIT ET ELICIT: 'expands and lures forth'. -- HERBESCENTEM: this word\r\noccurs nowhere else in Latin. -- NIXA: A. 254, _b_; G. 403, Rem. 3; H. 425,\r\n1, 1), n. -- FIBRIS STIRPIUM: so Tusc. 3, 13 _radicum fibras_. --\r\nGENICULATO: 'knotted'. The verb _geniculo_, from _genu_, scarcely occurs\r\nexcepting in the passive participle, which is always used, as here, of\r\nplants. So Plin. Nat. Hist. 16, 158 _geniculata cetera gracilitas nodisque\r\ndistincta_, speaking of the _harundo_. -- SPICI: besides _spica_, the forms\r\n_spicum_ and _spicus_ are occasionally found. _Spici_ here is explanatory\r\n_frugem_. -- VALLO: for the metaphor compare N.D. 2, 143 _munitae sunt\r\npalpebrae tamquam vallo pilorum_; Lucr. 2, 537.\r\n\r\n52. QUID EGO ... COMMEMOREM: this and similar formulae for passing to a new\r\nsubject are common; cf. 53 _quid ego ... proferam_ etc.; often _nam_\r\nprecedes the _quid_, as in Lael. 104. The _ego_ has a slight emphasis. Cato\r\nimplies that his own devotion to grape-culture was so well known as not to\r\nneed description. -- ORTUS SATUS INCREMENTA: 'origin, cultivation, and\r\ngrowth'. For the omission of the copula see n. on 53. -- UT: final, and\r\nslightly elliptic ('I say this that etc.'); so in 6 (where see n.), 24, 56,\r\n59, 82. -- REQUIETEM: the best MSS. of Cic. sometimes give the other form\r\n_requiem_, as in Arch. 13. -- VIM IPSAM: 'the inherent energy'. -- OMNIUM\r\n... TERRA: a common periphrasis for 'all plants'; cf. _e.g._ N.D. 2, 120.\r\nThe Latin has no one word to comprehend all vegetable products. -- QUAE ...\r\nPROCREET: 'able to generate'. -- TANTULO: strictly elliptic, implying\r\n_quantulum re vera est_. In such uses _tantus_ and _tantulus_ differ\r\nslightly from _magnus_ and _parvus_; they are more emphatic. -- ACINI\r\nVINACEO: 'a grape-stone'. -- MINUTISSIMIS: used here for _minimis_.\r\nStrictly speaking _minutus_ ought to be used of things which are fragments\r\nof larger things, _minutus_ being really the participle passive of _minuo_.\r\nIn a well-known passage (Orat. 94) Cic. himself calls attention to the\r\ntheoretical incorrectness of the use, which, however, is found throughout\r\nLatin literature. Cf. 46 _pocula minuta_; also below, 85 _minuti\r\nphilosophi_. -- MALLEOLI: vine-cuttings; so called because a portion of the\r\nparent stem was cut away with the new shoot, leaving the cutting in the\r\nshape of a mallet. -- PLANTAE: 'suckers', shoots springing out of the\r\ntrunk. -- SARMENTA: 'scions', shoots cut from branches not from the trunk.\r\n-- VIVIRADICES: 'quicksets', new plants formed by dividing the roots of the\r\nmother plant. -- PROPAGINES: 'layers', new plants formed by rooting a shoot\r\nin the earth without severing it from the parent plant; Verg. Georg. 2, 26.\r\n-- EADEM: n. on 4 _eandem_. -- CLAVICULIS: cf. N.D. 2, 120 _vites sic\r\nclaviculis_. -- ARS AGRICOLARUM: _agricolae arte freti_, a strong instance\r\nof the abstract put for the concrete.\r\n\r\n53. EIS: _sc. sarmentis_, those which have not been pruned away by the\r\nknife. -- EXSISTIT: 'springs up'. _Exsistere_ in good Latin never has the\r\nmeaning of our 'exist', _i.e._ '_to be in_ existence', but always means\r\n'_to come into_ existence'. -- ARTICULOS: 'joints'; cf. 51 _culmo\r\ngeniculato_. The word _tamquam_ softens the metaphor in _articuli_, which\r\nwould properly be used only of the joints in the limbs of animals. --\r\nGEMMA: Cicero took the meaning 'gem' or 'jewel' to be the primary sense of\r\n_gemma_ and considered that the application to a bud was metaphorical. See\r\nthe well-known passages, Orat. 81 and De Or. 3, 155. -- VESTITA PAMPINIS:\r\n'arrayed in the young foliage'. -- FRUCTU ... ASPECTU: ablatives of\r\nrespect, like _gustatu_ above. -- CAPITUM IUGATIO: 'the linking together of\r\ntheir tops'; _i.e._ the uniting of the tops of the stakes by cross-stakes.\r\nSo the editors; but Conington on Verg. Georg. 2, 355 seems to take _capita_\r\nof the top-foliage of the vines, an interpetation which is quite possible.\r\nThose editors are certainly wrong who remove the comma after _iugatio_ and\r\nplace it after _religatio_, as though _et_ were omitted between the two\r\nwords. In enumerations of more than two things Cic. either omits the copula\r\naltogether or inserts it before each word after the first; but in\r\nenumerating two things _et_ cannot be omitted, except where there are\r\nseveral _sets_ or _pairs_ of things. Cf. n. on 13. -- RELIGATIO: _i.e._ the\r\ntying down of shoots so as to cause them to take root in the earth.\r\n_Religatio_ seems to occur only here.\r\n\r\nP. 23. -- ALIORUM IMMISSIO: 'the granting of free scope to others'.\r\n_Immissio_ scarcely occurs elsewhere in good Latin. The metaphor is from\r\nletting loose the reins in driving; cf. Verg. Georg. 2, 364; Plin. N.H. 16,\r\n141 _cupressus immittitur in perticas asseresque amputatione ramorum_;\r\nVarro, R.R. 1, 31, 1 _vitis immittitur ad uvas pariendas_. Some, referring\r\nto Columella de Arbor, c. 7, take the word to mean the setting in the earth\r\nof a shoot in order that it may take root before being separated from the\r\nparent stem. The context, however, is against this interpretation. --\r\nIRRIGATIONES etc.: the plurals denote more prominently than singulars would\r\nthe repetition of the actions expressed by these words. -- REPASTINATIONES:\r\n'repeated hoeings'. The _pastinum_ was a kind of pitchfork, used for\r\nturning over the ground round about the vines, particularly when the young\r\nplants were being put in. -- MULTO TERRA FECUNDIOR: see n. on 3 _parum ...\r\nauctoritatis_.\r\n\r\n54. IN EO LIBRO: see Introd. -- DOCTUS: often used of poets, not only by\r\nCicero but by most other Latin writers, more particularly by the elegiac\r\npoets; see also n. on 13. -- HESIODUS: the oldest Greek poet after Homer.\r\nThe poem referred to here is the Εργα και ‛Ημεραι which we still possess,\r\nalong with the Theogony and the Shield of Heracles. -- CUM: concessive. --\r\nSAECULIS: 'generations', as in 24. -- FUIT: = _vixit_. -- LAERTEN: the\r\npassage referred to is no doubt the touching scene in Odyss. 24, 226, where\r\nOdysseus, after killing the suitors, finds his unhappy old father toiling\r\nin his garden. In that passage nothing is said of _manuring_. -- LENIENTEM:\r\nsee n. on 11 _dividenti_. -- COLENTEM etc.: the introduction of another\r\nparticiple to explain _lenientem_ is far from elegant. _Cultione agri_ or\r\nsomething of the kind might have been expected. The collocation of\r\n_appetentem_ with _occupatum_ in 56 is no less awkward. -- FACIT: n. on 3\r\n_facimus_. -- RES RUSTICAE LAETAE SUNT: 'the farmer's life is gladdened'.\r\n-- APIUM: this form is oftener found in the best MSS., of prose writers at\r\nleast, than the other form _apum_, which probably was not used by Cic. --\r\nOMNIUM: = _omnis generis_. -- CONSITIONES ... INSITIONES: 'planting ...\r\ngrafting'. On the varieties of grafting and the skill required for it see\r\nVerg. Georg. 2, 73 _seq._\r\n\r\n55. POSSUM: see n. on 24. -- IGNOSCETIS: 'you will excuse (me)'. --\r\nPROVECTUS SUM: 'I have been carried away'. Cicero often uses _prolabi_ in\r\nthe same sense. -- IN HAC ... CONSUMPSIT: Cic. probably never, as later\r\nwriters did, used _consumere_ with a simple ablative. -- CURIUS: see n. on\r\n15. -- A ME: = _a mea villa;_ cf. n. on 3 _apud quem_. -- ADMIRARI SATIS\r\nNON POSSUM: a favorite form of expression with Cicero; _e.g._ De Or. 1,\r\n165. -- DISCIPLINAM: 'morals'; literally 'teaching'.\r\n\r\n56. CURIO: Plutarch, Cat. 2, says the ambassadors found him cooking a\r\ndinner of herbs, and that Curius sent them away with the remark that a man\r\nwho dined in that way had no need of gold. The present was not brought as a\r\nbribe, since the incident took place after the war. Curius had become\r\n_patronus_ of the Samnites, and they were bringing the customary offering\r\nof _clientes_; see Rep. 3, 40. -- NE: here = num, a rare use; so Fin. 3,\r\n44; Acad. 2, 116. -- SED VENIO AD: so in 51 _venio nunc ad. Redeo ad_ (see\r\nn. on 32) might have been expected here. -- IN AGRIS ERANT: 'lived on their\r\nfarms'. For _erant_ cf. n. on 21 _sunt_. -- ID EST SENES: cf. 19 n. on\r\n_senatum_. -- SI QUIDEM: often written as one word _siquidem_ = ειπερ. --\r\nARANTI: emphatic position. -- CINCINNATO: L. Quinctius Cincinnatus is said\r\nto have been dictator twice; in 458 B.C., when he saved the Roman army,\r\nwhich was surrounded by the Aequians, and ended the war in sixteen days\r\nfrom his appointment; in 439, when Maelius was killed and Cincinnatus was\r\neighty years old. In our passage Cic. seems to assume only one\r\ndictatorship. The story of Cincinnatus at the plough is told in Livy 3, 26.\r\n-- FACTUM: the technical term was _dicere dictatorem_, since he was\r\nnominated by the consul on the advice of the senate. -- DICTATORIS: in\r\napposition with _cuius_.\r\n\r\nP. 24. -- MAELIUM: a rich plebeian, who distributed corn in time of famine\r\nand was charged with courting the people in order to make himself a king.\r\nAhala summoned him before the dictator, and because he did not immediately\r\nobey, killed him with his own hand. For this, Ahala became one of the\r\nheroes of his nation. See Liv. 4, 13. Cicero often mentions him with\r\npraise. Cf. in Catil. I. 3; p. Sestio 143, etc. -- APPETENTEM: = _quia\r\nappetebat_; so _occupatum_ = _cum occupasset_. -- VIATORES: literally\r\n'travellers', so 'messengers'. They formed a regularly organized\r\ncorporation at Rome and were in attendance on many of the magistrates.\r\nThose officers who had the _fasces_ had also lictors, who, however,\r\ngenerally remained in close attendance and were not despatched on distant\r\nerrands. The statement of Cic. in the text is repeated almost _verbatim_ by\r\nPlin. N.H. 18, 21. -- MISERABILIS: 'to be pitied'. The word does not quite\r\nanswer to our 'miserable'. -- AGRI CULTIONE: a rare expression, found\r\nelsewhere only in Verr. 3, 226; then not again till the 'Fathers'. -- HAUD\r\nSCIO AN NULLA: since _haud scio an_ is affirmative in Cicero, not negative\r\nas in some later writers, _nulla_ must be read here, not _ulla_. Cf. 73\r\n_haud scio an melius Ennius_, 'probably Ennius speaks better'; also 74\r\n_incertium an hoc ipso die_, 'possibly to-day'. Roby, 2256; G. 459, Rem.;\r\nH. 529, II. 3, 20, n. 2. -- QUAM DIXI: = _de qua dixi_, as in 53. --\r\nSATURITATE: the word is said to occur nowhere else in Latin. -- QUIDAM:\r\n_i.e._ the authors of the _tertia vituperatio senectutis_, whom Cato\r\nrefutes in 39, 59. -- PORCO ... GALLINA: these words are used collectively,\r\nas _rosa_ often is; so Fin. 2, 65 _potantem in rosa Thorium_. -- IAM:\r\n'further'. -- SUCCIDIAM ALTERAM: 'a second meat-supply'. The word seems to\r\nbe connected with _caedo_, and probably originally meant 'slaughter'. In a\r\nfragment of Cato preserved by Gellius 13, 24, 12 (in some editions 13, 25,\r\n12) we find _succidias humanas facere_. Varro, R.R. 2, 14 has the word in\r\nthe sense of 'meat'. -- CONDITIORA FACIT: 'adds a zest to'; cf. _condita_\r\nin 10. -- SUPERVACANEIS OPERIS: 'by the use of spare time'; literally 'by\r\nmeans of toils that are left over', _i.e._ after completing the ordinary\r\nwork of the farm.\r\n\r\n57. ORDINIBUS: cf. 59 _ordines_. -- BREVI PRAECIDAM: 'I will cut the matter\r\nshort', for _praecidam_ (_sc. rem_ or _sermonem_) cf. Acad. 2, 133\r\n_praecide_ (_sc. sermonem_); for _brevi_ (= 'in brief', εν βραχει) cf. De\r\nOr. 1, 34 _ne plura consecter comprehendam brevi_. -- USU UBERIUS: cf. 53\r\n_fructu laetius ... aspectu pulchrius_. -- AD QUEM ... RETARDAT: some have\r\nthought that there is zeugma here, supposing _ad_ to be suited only to\r\n_invitat_, not to _retardat_. That this is not the case is clear from such\r\npassages as Caes. B.G. 7, 26, 2 _palus Romanos ad insequendum tardabat_ (=\r\n_tardos faciebat_); Cic. Sull. 49 _nullius amicitia ad pericula propulsanda\r\nimpedimur_. On _fruendum_ see Madvig, 421, _a_, Obs. 2 and 265, Obs. 2; G.\r\n428, Rem. 3, exc.; H. 544, 2, n. 5. -- INVITAT ATQUE ALLECTAT: one of the\r\n'doublets' of which Cicero is so fond; cf. Lael. 99 _allectant et\r\ninvitant_.\r\n\r\n58. SIBI HABEANT: _sc. iuvenes_; contemptuous, as in Lael. 18 _sibi habeant\r\nsapientiae nomen_ Sull. 26 _sibi haberent honores, sibi imperia_ etc.; cf.\r\nthe formula of Roman divorce, _tu tuas res tibi habeto_. -- HASTAS: in\r\npractising, the point was covered by a button, _pila_; cf. Liv. 26, 51\r\n_praepilatis missilibus iaculati sunt_. -- CLAVAM: cf. Vegetius de Re Mil.\r\n1, 11 _clavas ligneas pro gladiis tironibus dabant, eoque modo exercebantur\r\nad palos_; Iuv. 6, 246. The _palus_ is called _stipes_ by Martial 7, 32. --\r\nPILAM ... VENATIONES ... CURSUS: all national amusements, well known to\r\nreaders of Horace; see Becker's Gallus. _Venationes_, em. for _nataliones_.\r\n-- TALOS ... TESSERAS: _tali_, 'knucklebones', were oblong, and rounded at\r\nthe two ends; the sides were numbered 1 and 6 (1 being opposite to 6), 3\r\nand 4. Four _tali_ were used at a time and they, like the _tesserae_, were\r\ngenerally thrown from a box, _fritillus_. The _tesserae_, of which three\r\nwere used at a time, were cubes, with the sides numbered from 1 to 6 in\r\nsuch a way that the numbers on two opposite sides taken together always\r\nmade 7. A separate name was used by dicers for almost every possible throw\r\nof the _tesserae_ and _tali_. The two best known are _canis_, when all the\r\ndice turned up with the same number uppermost; and _venus_, when they all\r\nshowed different numbers. The word _alea_ was general and applicable to\r\ngames of chance of every kind. These games, which were forbidden by many\r\nineffectual laws ('_vetita legibus alea_') were held to be permissible for\r\nold men; see Mayor on Iuv. 14, 4. -- ID IPSUM: sc. _faciunt_; the omission\r\nof _facere_ is not uncommon. Roby, 1441; H. 368, 3, n. 1. -- UT: em. for\r\nordinary readings _unum_ and _utrum_.\r\n\r\n59. LEGITE: 'continue to read'. Cf. De Or. 1, 34 _pergite, ut facitis,\r\nadulescentes_. In Tusc. 2, 62 it is stated that Africanus was a great\r\nreader of Xenophon.\r\n\r\nP. 25. -- LIBRO QUI EST DE: so in Fat. 1 _libris qui sunt de natura\r\ndeorum,_ and similarly elsewhere; but the periphrasis is often avoided, as\r\nin Off. 2, 16 _Dicaearchi liber de interitu hominum_. -- QUI: _quique_\r\nmight have been expected, but the words above, _qui ... familiari,_ are\r\nregarded as parenthetical. -- OECONOMICUS: Cicero translates from this work\r\nc. 4, 20-25. -- INSCRIBITUR: see n. on 13. -- REGALE: 'worthy of a king';\r\ndifferent from _regium_, which would mean 'actually characteristic of\r\nkings'. Yet Cic. sometimes interchanges the words; thus _regalis potestas_\r\nin Har. Resp. 54 is the same as _regia potestas_ in Phil. 1, 3. -- LOQUITUR\r\nCUM CRITOBULO etc.: 'discourses with Critobulus of how Cyrus etc.'. The\r\nconstruction of _loqui_ with acc. and inf. belongs to colloquial Latin, as\r\ndoes the construction _loqui aliquam rem_ for _de aliqua re_; cf. Att. 1,\r\n5, 6 _mecum Tadius locutus est te ita scripsisse_; ib. 9, 13, 1 _mera\r\nscelera loquuntur_. -- CYRUM MINOREM: Cyrus the younger (cf. 79 _Cyrus\r\nmaior_), well known from Xenophon's _Anabasis_. As Cyrus never arrived at\r\nthe throne (having been killed at Cunaxa in 401 in his attempt to oust his\r\nbrother the king with the help of the 10,000 Greeks) _regem_ is used in the\r\nsense of 'prince', as in Verr. 4, 61 and elsewhere; βασιλευς is used in\r\nexactly the same way in a passage of the Oeconomicus which comes a little\r\nbefore the one Cic. is here rendering (4, 16). -- LYSANDER: the great\r\ncommander who in 405 B.C. won the battle of Aegospotamos against the\r\nAthenians. -- SARDIS: acc. pl.; _-is_ represents Gk. -εις. -- CONSAEPTUM\r\nAGRUM: 'park'; the phrase is a translation of Xenophon's παραδεισον; this\r\nwill account for the omission of _et_ before _diligenter consitum_. --\r\nDILIGENTER: 'carefully'. -- PROCERITATES: the plural probably indicates the\r\nheight of each _kind_ of tree. -- QUINCUNCEM: thus:·:·:·:·:·:·: This was\r\nthe order of battle in the Roman army during a great part of its history.\r\nThe cause for this application of the term is rather difficult to see; it\r\noriginally meant five-twelfths of an _uncia_; possibly it was thus applied\r\nbecause by drawing lines between the points the letter V (five) might be\r\nproduced. As regards its application to trees, see Verg. Georg. 2, 277-284.\r\n-- PURAM: so the farmers talk of 'cleaning' the land. -- DIMENSA: notice\r\nthe passive use of this participle, originally deponent; cf. n. on 4\r\n_adeptam_. -- DISCRIPTA: 'arranged'; so _discriptio_ a little farther on.\r\nCf. n. on 5 _descriptae_. -- ORNATUM: 'costume', used by Latin writers of\r\nany dress a little unfamiliar. So in Plaut. Miles 4, 4, 41 (1177 R)\r\n_ornatus nauclericus_.\r\n\r\n60. IMPEDIT: _sc. nos_; with this construction the pronoun is always\r\nomitted. -- VALERIUM: when a young man, in 349 B.C., he engaged in combat\r\nwith a Gaul, in sight of the Roman and Gallic armies, and came off victor\r\nby the aid of a raven, _corvus_; hence the name Corvinus (Liv. 7, 26). His\r\nfirst consulship was in 348, his last in 299; Cic. has miscalculated.\r\nValerius was also twice dictator and is said to have held altogether 21\r\nterms of curule offices. -- PERDUXISSE: _sc. agri colendi studia_. Cf.\r\nLael. 33 _quod -- perduxissent_. -- ESSET: cf. n. on 21. -- AETATE: here =\r\nthe vigorous period of life; cf. _bona aetas_ in 48. -- CURSUS HONORUM:\r\n'official career'. -- HUIUS: _ille_ and _hic_ are not often found in the\r\nsame sentence referring to the same person. _Eius_ would have been more\r\nregular here. -- MEDIA: cf. n. on 33 _constantis aetatis_.\r\n\r\nP. 26. -- APEX: 'the crown', 'the highest glory'. The word meant originally\r\n'knot', being connected with _ap-tus ap-isci ap-ere_ and other words\r\ncontaining the idea of binding fast or grasping. It was properly applied to\r\nthe olive-twig bound round with wool, which was stuck in the cap worn by\r\nthe _flamines_ and _salii_. It is sometimes employed to translate διαδημα\r\n(a word originally of similar meaning), the royal _insigne_, as in Horace,\r\nOdes, 3, 21, 20 _regum apices_, with which cf. Odes, 1, 34, 14. The word is\r\nscarcely found elsewhere in a metaphorical sense. Our passage is imitated\r\nby Ammianus Marcellinus (a great imitator of Cicero) 27, 7, 2 _Rufinus\r\nvelut apicem honoratae senectutis praetendens_.\r\n\r\n61. METELLO: see n. on 30. -- A. ATILIO CALATINO: consul in 258 B.C. and\r\nagain in 254; dictator in 249, censor in 247. Cicero classed him with old\r\nheroes like Curius and Fabricius (Planc. 60). His tomb was on the _via\r\nAppia_ outside the _Porta Capena_, close to the well-known tomb of the\r\nScipios (see Tusc. 1, 13). -- IN QUEM ... ELOGIUM: 'in whose honor there is\r\nthe inscription'. With _in quem = de quo_ cf. the occasional occurrence of\r\nκατα τινος in the sense of περι τινος. -- ELOGIUM: Greek ελεγειον (so\r\nCurtius): for the representation of ε by _o_ cf. _oliva_ with ελαια, and\r\nPlautus' lopadas for λεπαδας. But cf. Roby, 929, d. -- HUNC etc.: the\r\ninscription (which is quoted by Cicero also in Fin. 2, 116) is strikingly\r\nlike that on the tomb of _Scipio Barbatus_ which has actually come down to\r\nus, and thus begins (Ritschl's recension):\r\n\r\n  _honc oino ploirime cosentiont Romai_\r\n  _duonoro optumo fuise viro viroro_\r\n\r\n_i.e. hunc unum plurimi consentiunt Romae bonorum optimum fuisse virum\r\nvirorum_. Ritschl thus completes the _elogium_ of Atilus, by comparison\r\nwith others still preserved: _dictator_ (ending the second line), _Consul,\r\ncensor, aedilis hic fuit apud vos_. But Cicero's words (_nolum ...\r\nsepulcro_) seem to imply a longer inscription than one of three lines; the\r\nanalogy of the Scipionic inscriptions points the same way. The older\r\nmonumental inscriptions of Rome were written in the Saturnian metre, which\r\ndepended partly on accent. The normal line ran thus:\r\n\r\n  v -' v - v -' v' | -' v - v -' v'\r\n\r\nbut there were many deviations. -- UNUM: intensifies _primarium_, 'the very\r\nfirst'; cf. the common use of _unus_ with a superlative adjective, for\r\nwhich see n. on Lael. 1 _unum_ etc. -- ESSET CONSENTIENS: cf. n. on 26\r\n_agens aliquid_. -- NUPER: like _modo_ (see n. on 27) _nuper_ is loosely\r\nused, and has its meaning defined by the context. Cf. n. on Lael. 13. In\r\nPlin. Ep. 1, 2, 2 the orator Calvus, a younger contemporary of Cicero, is\r\nsaid to have existed _nuper_. -- LEPIDUM: _pontifex maximus_ from 180 B.C.,\r\nconsul in 187 and in 175; censor in 179; he is said to have been chosen\r\n_princeps senatus_ by six sets of censors in succession. He died in 152. --\r\nPAULO: see 29 _L. Aemilius_ with n. -- MAXIMO: see 10 _et seq_. --\r\nSENTENTIA: _i.e._ a set speech in the senate. Cf. De Or. 1, 38 _is non\r\naccurata orationis copia, sed nutu atque verbo libertinos in urbanas tribus\r\ntranstulit_. -- HONORATA: see n. on 22.\r\n\r\n62. IN OMNI ORATIONE: 'everywhere throughout my speech'. _Tota oratione_\r\nwould have meant 'my speech viewed as a whole'. -- DEFENDERET: the tense is\r\naccommodated to that of _dixi_, according to Latin custom; see n. on 42\r\n_efficeret_. -- CANI: _sc. capilli_; the same ellipsis is found in Ovid.\r\nCf. _calda (sc. aqua), laurea (sc. corona), natalis (sc. dies), Latinae\r\n(sc. feriae)_, etc.; also _cereo_ in 44. -- FRUCTUS ... EXTREMOS: 'receives\r\nthe reward of influence at the last'.\r\n\r\n63. APPETI: 'to be courted'; _decedi_: 'to take precedence', literally\r\n'that there should be a yielding of the way'. -- ASSURGI: 'the honor shown\r\nby rising'. Cf. Iuv. 13, 54 _credebant grande nefas et morte piandum si\r\niuvenis vetulo non assurrexerat_, where see Mayor's note. -- DEDUCI REDUCI:\r\n'the escort from home and the attendance homeward'. The difference between\r\nthese two words, which has often been misunderstood, is shown by Val. Max.\r\n2, 1, 9 _iuvenes senatus die utique aliquem ex patribus conscriptis ad\r\ncuriam deducebant, affixique valvis exspectabant donec reducendi etiam\r\nofficio fungerentur_. -- CONSULI: probably refers to private legal\r\nconsultations as well as to the deliberations of the senate. -- UT QUAEQUE\r\nOPTIME: Cic. often uses _ut quisque_ with superlatives, _ita_ following;\r\nsee n. on Lael. 19. Translate _ut ... ita_ 'in proportion as ... so'. --\r\nMORATA: from _mos_. -- MODO: in 59. -- MEMORIAE PRODITUM EST: in Verr. 5,\r\n36 Cic. uses _ad memoriam_ instead of the dative. The best writers have\r\n_memoriae prodere_ and _prodi_, '_for the recollection of_ posterity',\r\n_memoria prodi_, 'to be handed down _by_ tradition'; but not _memoria\r\nprodere_. -- LUDIS: _sc. Panathenaicis_, abl. of time. The Panathenaea was\r\nthe greatest of the Athenian festivals and was celebrated in honor of\r\nAthene, patron goddess of the city, once in four years. The story that\r\nfollows is told in almost the same words by Val. Max. 4, 5, ext. 2.\r\n\r\nP. 27. -- QUI: at this point the _oratio obliqua_ is broken off, but it is\r\nresumed in the next sentence, _dixisse_ being dependent on _proditum est_.\r\n-- LEGATI CUM ESSENT: 'being ambassadors'. -- ILLI: 'in his honor'. --\r\nSESSUM RECEPISSE: Val. Max. uses the same phrase; cf. Fam. 10, 32, 2\r\n_sessum deducere_; N.D. 3, 74 _sessum ire_.\r\n\r\n64. PLAUSUS MULTIPLEX: cf. Verg. Aen. 1, 747 _ingeminant plausu_. Cic.\r\ngenerally says _plausus maximus_. -- FACERE NOLLE: cf. the well-known\r\nsaying of Demosthenes, Olynth. 3, § 3 πεπεισμαι γαρ τα πλειω των πραγματων\r\n‛υμας εκπεφευγεναι τωι μη βουλεσθαι τα δεοντα ποιειν, η τωι μη συνιεναι. --\r\nCOLLEGIO: the college or board of augurs to which Cato belonged. In his\r\ntime there were nine members; later the number was increased. -- ANTECEDIT:\r\n_sc. alios_. -- SENTENTIAE PRINCIPATUM: 'precedence in debate'. Meissner\r\nquotes Verr. 4, 142 _ut quisque aetate et honore antecedit, ita primus\r\nsolet sua sponte dicere itaque a ceteris ei conceditur_. -- HONORE: _i.e._\r\nas regards office, past or present. -- QUI ... SUNT: actual praetors or\r\nconsuls. -- COMPARANDAE: n. on 50. -- FABULAM AETATIS: cf. 5, 70, 85. The\r\ncomparison of life to a play, and mankind to the players, is common in all\r\nliterature; _e.g._ 'All the world's a stage, etc.'. When Augustus was on\r\nhis deathbed he asked his friends _ecquid eis videretur mimum vitae commode\r\ntransegisse_ (Suet. Aug. 99); cf. Gay's epitaph, 'Life's a jest, etc.'. --\r\nCORRUISSE: _i.e._ through fatigue; cf. _defetigationem_ in 85.\r\n\r\n65. AT: see n. on 21. -- MORUM: cf. 7 _in moribus est culpa, non in\r\naetate_. -- EA VITIA: _i.e. ea alia vitia_. -- HABENT etc.: cf. Thucyd. 3,\r\n44 εχοντες τι συγγνωμης. -- NON ... VIDEATUR: 'not well grounded indeed,\r\nbut such as it may seem possible to allow'. _Ille_ is often used with\r\n_quidem_ in making concessions where the English idiom requires no pronoun.\r\nRoby, 2259; Madvig, 489, _b_; Kennedy, 65, n. 2; A. 151, _e_; G. 292, Rem.\r\n4; H. 450, 4, n. 2. -- CONTEMNI ... DESPICI: see n. on 43 _spreta et\r\ncontempta_. -- MORIBUS BONIS ET ARTIBUS: for the order of the words cf. n.\r\non 1 _animi tui_. -- IN VITA: 'in everyday life' -- ADELPHIS: _Adelphi_ =\r\nαδελφοι, The Brothers; this play of Terence is still extant. -- DIRITAS:\r\n'harshness of temper'; but Suet. Tib. 21 has _diritas morum_, and Varro\r\n_scena quem senem Latina vidit dirissimum_. Both _dirus_ and _diritas_ are\r\nrare in Cicero; the former word does not once occur in the whole range of\r\nthe speeches, the latter scarcely excepting here and in Vat. 9; in Tusc. 3,\r\n29 Cic. uses it in translating from Euripides.\r\n\r\nP. 28. -- 66. SOLLICITAM HABERE: 'to keep in trouble'. _Sollicitus_ is,\r\nliterally, 'wholly in motion', from _sollus_, which has the same root with\r\n‛ολος, and _citus_; cf. the rare words _sollifides_, _solliferreus_. The\r\nperfect participle with _habeo_ emphasizes the continuance of the effect\r\nproduced. Zumpt, 634; A. 292, _c_; G. 230; H. 388, 1, n. -- NOSTRAM\r\nAETATEM: cf. n. on 26 _senectus_. -- ESSE LONGE: more usually _abesse_. --\r\nO MISERUM: 'O, wretched is that old man'. Cicero oftener joins _O_ with the\r\naccusative than with the nominative: he rarely, if ever, uses the\r\ninterjection with the vocative in direct address to persons. -- EXTINGUIT\r\nANIMUM: the doctrine of the annihilation of the soul after death was held\r\nby many of Cicero's contemporaries, professedly by the Epicureans (_e.g._\r\nLucretius, De Rerum Nat. 3, 417 _et seq._; cf. also Caesar's argument at\r\nthe trial of the Catilinian conspirators, Sall. Bell. Catil. c. 51, Cic. in\r\nCatil. 3, c. 4), practically by the Stoics, who taught that there is a\r\nfuture existence of limited though indefinite length. -- DEDUCIT: cf. n. on\r\n63. -- ATQUI: see n. on 6. -- TERTIUM ... POTEST: 'nothing can be found as\r\na third alternative': so in Tusc. 1, 82 _quoniam nihil tertium est._\r\n\r\n67. QUID TIMEAM etc.: so Tusc. 1, 25 _quo modo igitur aut cur mortem malum\r\ntibi videri dicis? quae aut beatas nos efficiet, animis manentibus, aut non\r\nmiseros, sensu carentis;_ ib. 1, 118 _ut aut in aeternam domum remigremus\r\naut omni sensu careamus._ For mood see A. 268; G. 251; H 486, II. -- AUT\r\nNON MISER ... AUT BEATUS: a dilemma, but unsound and not conclusive; for\r\n_non miser_ is used with reference to annihilation, and the soul may exist\r\nafter death in a state of unhappiness. -- FUTURUS SUM: see n. on 6 _futurum\r\nest_. -- QUAMVIS SIT: prose writers of the Republican period use _quamvis_\r\nwith the subjunctive only; see Roby, 1624, 1627; A. 313,_a, g_; G. 608; H.\r\n515, III. and n. 3. -- CUI: see n. on 38 _viventi_. -- AD VESPERUM ESSE\r\nVICTURUM: 'that he will be alive when evening comes', _not_ 'that he will\r\nlive till the evening'. With the prepositions _ad_, _sub_, _in_ the form\r\n_vesper_ is generally used, not _vespera._ With this passage cf. Fin. 2, 92\r\n_an id exploratum cuiquam potest esse quo modo sese habiturum sit corpus.\r\nnon dico ad annum, sed ad vesperum?_ Also cf. the title of one of Varro's\r\nMenippean Satires, _nescis quid vesper serus vehat_, probably a proverb. --\r\nAETAS ILLA ... ADULESCENTES: some suppose that this sentence was borrowed\r\nfrom Hippocrates. -- TRISTIUS: '_severioribus remediis_'. Manutius. So Off.\r\n1, 83 _leviter aegrotantis leniter curant, gravioribus autem morbis\r\npericulosas curationes et ancipites adhibere coguntur_. The adverb\r\n_tristius_, which has in prose a superlative but no positive, occurs in\r\nFam. 4, 13, 5. -- MENS ... RATIO ... CONSILIUM: cf. n. on 41. -- QUI ...\r\nNULLI: cf. n. on 46 _qui pauci_; but _nulli_ here almost = _non_. -- NULLAE\r\n... FUISSENT: _i.e._ the young men would have brought every country to\r\nruin; see 20. -- CUM ... CUM: see n. on 4.\r\n\r\n68. IN FILIO ... IN FRATRIBUS: cf. Lael. 9. As to Cato's son cf. 15, 84. --\r\nTU: _sc. sensisti_. -- EXSPECTATIS AD: a rare construction, perhaps without\r\nparallel; _exspectatis_ is an adjective and takes the construction of\r\n_aptus_, _idoneus_ etc., 'of whom hopes were entertained as regards honor'.\r\n-- FRATRIBUS: the sons of Paulus Macedonicus, two of them died within seven\r\ndays (Fam. 4, 6, 1), one just before and one just after Paulus' great\r\ntriumph in 167 B.C. -- IDEM: see n. on 4 _eandem_. -- INSIPIENTER:\r\nadversative asyndeton. -- INCERTA ... VERIS: chiasmus avoided. With the\r\nthought cf. Off. 1, 18. -- AT ... AT: the objection and its answer are both\r\nintroduced by _at_, as here, in 35. -- AT ... ADULESCENS: these words look\r\nback to the preceding sentence, to which they are an answer. -- ILLE ...\r\nHIC: here _hic_ denotes the person who is more important, _ille_ the person\r\nwho is less important for the matter in hand; the former may therefore be\r\nregarded as nearer to the speaker, the latter as more remote. A. 102, _a_;\r\nG. 292, Rem. 1; H. 450, 2, n.\r\n\r\n69. QUAMQUAM: see n. on 2 _etsi_. -- QUID EST ... DIU: cf. Tusc. 1, 94\r\n_quae vero aetas longa est, aut quid omnino homini longum? ... quia ultra\r\nnihil habemus, hoc longum dicimus_. For _est_ see n. on 72. -- TARTESSIORUM\r\n... GADIBUS: the whole of the south coast of Spain bore the name\r\n_Tartessus_, but the name is often confined to Gades, the chief city. --\r\nFUIT: = _vixit_. -- SCRIPTUM VIDEO: so in Acad. 2, 129; Div. 1, 31; cf.\r\nalso N.D. 1, 72 _ut videmus in scriptis_; Off. 2, 25 _ut scriptum legimus_;\r\nalso cf. n. on 26 _videmus_. -- ARGANTHONIUS: the story is from Herodotus\r\n1, 163.\r\n\r\nP. 29. -- ALIQUID EXTREMUM: see n. on 5; cf. pro Marcello 27 -- EFFLUXIT:\r\nstrongly aoristic in sense 'at once is gone'. -- TANTUM: -- 'only so much'.\r\n-- CONSECUTUS SIS: 'you may have obtained'. The subjunctive is here used in\r\nthe indefinite second person to give a hypothetical character to the\r\nstatement of the verb. The indicative might have been expected; the\r\nexpression almost = _consecuti sumus, consecutus aliquis est_. Roby, 1546;\r\nG. 252, Rem. 3; H. 486, III. -- VIRTUTE ET RECTE FACTIS: the same opinion\r\nis enforced in Tusc. 1, 109. -- QUID SEQUATUR: 'the future'; cf. Lucr. 1,\r\n459 _transactum quid sit in aevo, Tum quae res instet, quid porro deinde\r\nsequatur_. -- QUOD ... CONTENTUS: this passage with the whole context\r\nresembles Lucretius 3, 931-977; cf. especially 938 _cur non ut plenus vitae\r\nconviva recedis_; 960 _satur ac plenus discedere rerum_. Cf. also Hor. Sat.\r\n1, 1, 117-118.\r\n\r\n70. UT PLACEAT: 'in order to secure approval'. -- PERAGENDA: cf. n. on 50\r\n_comparandae_. -- PLAUDITE: the Latin plays nearly always ended with this\r\nword, addressed by the actor to the audience; cf. Hor. A.P. 153 _si\r\nplausoris eges aulaea manentis et usque Sessuri donec cantor 'vos plaudite'\r\ndicat_. -- BREVE TEMPUS etc.: one of the poets has said that 'in small\r\nmeasures lives may perfect be'. Cf. also Tusc. 1, 109 _nemo parum diu vixit\r\nqui virtutis perfectae perfecto functus est munere_; Seneca, Ep. 77 _quo\r\nmodo fabula, sic vita: non quam diu, sed quam bene acta sit refert_. --\r\nPROCESSERIT: probably the subject is _sapiens_, in which case _aetate_ must\r\nalso be supplied from _aetatis_; the subject may however be _aetas_. --\r\nOSTENDIT: 'gives promise of'; cf. Fam. 9, 8, 1 _etsi munus_ (gladiatorial\r\nshow) _flagitare quamvis quis ostenderit, ne populus quidem solet nisi\r\nconcitatus_. With the whole passage cf. pro Cael. 76.\r\n\r\n71. UT ... DIXI: in 9, 60, 62. -- SECUNDUM NATURAM: = κατα φυσιν a Stoic\r\nphrase; cf. n. on 5 _naturam optimam ducem_. -- SENIBUS: dative of\r\nreference; _emori_ stands as subject to an implied _est_. -- CONTINGIT: see\r\nn. on 8. -- EXSTINGUITUR: there is the same contrast between _opprimere_\r\nand _exstinguere_ in Lael. 78. -- QUASI ... EVELLUNTUR: it is rare to find\r\nin Cic. or the other prose writers of the best period a verb in the\r\nindicative mood immediately dependent on _quasi_, in the sense of _sicut_\r\nor _quem ad modum_. When two things are compared by _quasi ... ita_, the\r\nindicative verb is nearly always put in the second clause, and may be\r\nsupplied in the clause with _quasi_; very rarely are there two different\r\nverbs for the two clauses. Cf. however Plautus, Stich. 539 _fuit olim,\r\nquasi nunc ego sum senex_; Lucr. 3, 492 _agens animam spumat quasi_ ...\r\n_fervescunt undae_. -- SI ... SI: for the more usual _si ... sin_. --\r\nACCEDAM: see A. 342; G. 666; H. 529, II. -- IN PORTUM: speaking of death,\r\nCic. says in Tusc. 1, 118 _portum potius paratum nobis et perfugium\r\nputemus: quo utinam velis passis pervehi liceat! Sin reflantibus ventis\r\nreiciemur tamen eodem paulo tardius referamur necesse est_; cf. also ib. 1,\r\n107.\r\n\r\nP. 30. -- 72. MUNUS OFFICI: see n. on 29. -- TUERI: 'uphold'. -- POSSIT:\r\nsubject indefinite. -- EX QUO FIT etc.: the argument seems to be that youth\r\nknows how long it has to last and is therefore less spirited than age,\r\nwhich knows not when it will end. -- ANIMOSIOR ... FORTIOR: Horace, Odes 2,\r\n10, 21 _rebus angustis animosus atque fortis appare_; the two words are\r\njoined also in Cic. Mil. 92: _animosus_, 'spirited'. -- HOC ILLUD EST etc.:\r\n'this is the meaning of the answer made by Solon etc'. Cf. Div. 1, 122 _hoc\r\nnimirum illud est quod de Socrate accepimus_, also the Greek phrase ‛η\r\nτουτ' εκεινο. _Est_ = _valet_ as in 69. -- PISISTRATUS: the despot of\r\nAthens, who seized the power in 560 B.C. Plutarch, who tells the story, 'An\r\nSeni Sit Gerenda Respublica' c. 21, makes Solon speak to the friends of\r\nPisistratus, not to P. himself. -- QUAERENTI: see n. on 11 _dividenti_. --\r\nAUDACITER: Quintil. 1, 6, 17 condemns those who used _audaciter_ for\r\n_audacter_, which latter form, he says, had been used by 'all orators'. Yet\r\nthe form _audaciter_ is pretty well attested by MSS. here and elsewhere in\r\nCicero. [See Neue, Formenlehre, 1² 662.] For the two forms cf.\r\n_difficiliter, difficulter. Audaciter_ is of importance as showing that _c_\r\nbefore _i_ must have been pronounced just like _c_ in any other position,\r\nnot as in modern Italian. -- CERTIS SENSIBUS: Acad. 2, 19 _integris\r\nincorruptisque sensibus_. -- IPSA ... QUAE: see n. on 26. H. 569, I. 2. --\r\nCOAGMENTAVIT: Cic. is fond of such metaphors; cf. Orat. 77 _verba verbis\r\nquasi coagmentari_; Phil. 7, 21 _docebo ne coagmentari quidem pacem posse_\r\n('that no patched-up peace can be made'). -- CONGLUTINAVIT: a still more\r\nfavorite metaphor than _coagmentare_. Cic. has _conglutinare rem _ (Or. 1,\r\n188); _amicitias_ (Lael. 32 and Att. 7, 8, 1); _voluntates_ (Fam. 11, 27,\r\n2); _concordiam_. (Att. 1, 17, 10); in Phil. 3, 28 Cic. says of Antony that\r\nhe is _totus ex vitiis conglutinatus_. -- IAM: 'further', so below. --\r\nCONGLUTINATIO: the noun occurs only here and Orat. 78 _c. verborum_. --\r\nRELIQUUM: not infrequently, as here, used substantively with an adjective\r\nmodifier. -- SINE CAUSA: 'without sufficient reason'.\r\n\r\n73. VETAT PYTHAGORAS etc.: the passage is from Plato, Phaedo 61 A-62 C.\r\nPlato makes Socrates there profess to quote Philolaus, the Pythagorean;\r\nCic. therefore refers the doctrine to Pythagoras Cf. Tusc. 1, 74; Rep. 6,\r\n15. The Stoics held the same view about suicide, which they authorized in\r\nextreme cases, but much less freely than is commonly supposed; cf. Sen. Ep.\r\n117, 22 _nihil mihi videtur turpius quam optare mortem_. See Zeller,\r\nStoics, Epicureans, and Sceptics, Ch. 12, C (2); cf. also Lecky, Hist. of\r\nEuropean Morals, I. p. 228 _et seq_. (Am. ed.) -- IMPERATORIS ...\r\nPRAESIDIO: here Cic. seems to understand Plato's φρουραι as referring to\r\nwarfare; in Tusc. and Rep. he understands it of a prison. -- SAPIENTIS:\r\nSolon was one of the 'Seven Sages of Greece'. -- ELOGIUM: the distich is\r\npreserved by Plutarch, and runs thus: μηδε μοι ακλαυστος θανατος μολοι,\r\nαλλα φιλοισι Καλλειποιμι θανων αλγεα και στοναχας. Cic. thus translates it\r\nin Tusc. 1, 117 _Mors mea ne careat lacrimis, linquamus amicis Maerorem, ut\r\ncelebrent funera cum gemitu_. The epitaph of Ennius is also quoted there\r\nand is declared to be better than that of Solon (cf. Tusc. 1, 34). -- VOLT\r\nSE ESSE CARUM: 'he wishes to make out that he is beloved'; _volt esse\r\ncarus_ would have had quite a different sense. Cf. Fin. 5, 13 _Strato\r\nphysicum se volt_, with Madvig's n. -- HAUD SCIO AN: see n. on 56. --\r\nFAXIT: the subject is _quisquam_ understood from _nemo_. For the form see\r\nA. 142, 128, _e_, 3; G. 191, 5; H. 240, 4. The end of the epitaph is\r\nomitted here as in Tusc. 1, 117, but is given in Tusc. 1, 34 _cur? volito\r\nvivas per ora virum_. Notice the alliteration.\r\n\r\n74. ISQUE: cf. n. on 13 _vixitque_. -- AUT OPTANDUS AUT NULLUS: cf. 66 _aut\r\nneglegenda ... aut optanda; nullus_ almost = _non_ as in 67, but only in\r\nthe Letters does Cic. (imitating Plautus and the other dramatists) attach\r\n_nullus_ in this sense to the name of a particular person; _e.g._ Att. 11,\r\n24, 4 _Philotimus nullus venit_. -- SED ... ESSE: 'but we must con this\r\nlesson from our youth up'. For the passive sense of _meditatum_ cf. n. on 4\r\n_adeptam_. In Tusc. 1, 74 Cic., imitating Plato, says _tota philosophorum\r\nvita commentatio mortis est_. So Seneca, _tota vita discendum est mori_. --\r\nSINE QUA ... NEMO POTEST: these words bring the position of Cicero with\r\nregard to death wonderfully near that of Lucretius: the latter argues that\r\nfor peace of mind one must believe '_nullum esse sensum post mortem_'; the\r\nformer's lesson is '_aut nullum esse sensum aut optandum_'. -- TIMENS: =\r\n_si quis timet_; the subject of _poterit_ is the indefinite _quis_ involved\r\nin _timens_. A. 310, _a_; G. 670; H. 549, 2. -- QUI: = _quo modo_, as in 4.\r\n-- ANIMO CONSISTERE: so in pro Quint. 77; also _mente consistere_ in Phil.\r\n2, 68; Div. 2, 149; Q. Fr. 2, 3, 2 _neque mente neque lingua neque ore\r\nconsistere_. The word is, literally, 'to stand firm', 'to get a firm\r\nfoothold'.\r\n\r\nP. 31. -- 75. L. BRUTUM: fell in single combat with Aruns, son of the\r\nexiled Tarquin; see Liv. 2, 6. The accusatives _Brutum_ etc. are not the\r\nobjects of _recorder_ but the subjects of infinitives to be supplied from\r\n_profectas_. -- DUOS DECIOS: see n. on 43. -- CURSUM EQUORUM: the word\r\n_equos_ would have been sufficient; but this kind of pleonasm is common in\r\nLatin; see n. on Lael. 30 _causae diligendi_. -- ATILIUS: _i.e._ Regulus,\r\nwhose story is too well known to need recounting. There are many\r\ncontradictions and improbabilities about it. -- SCIPIONES: see n. on 29. In\r\nParadoxa 1, 12 Cic. says of them _Carthaginiensium adventum corporibus suis\r\nintercludendum putaverunt_. -- POENIS: on the dat. see A. 235, _a_; H. 384,\r\n4, n. 2. -- PAULUM: n. on 29 _L. Aemilius_. -- COLLEGAE: M. Terentius\r\nVarro. There is no reason to suppose that he was a worse general than many\r\nother Romans who met Hannibal and were beaten; the early historians, being\r\nall aristocrats, fixed the disgrace of Cannae on the democratic consul.\r\nVarro's contemporaries were more just to him. Far from reproaching him, the\r\nSenate commended his spirit, and several times afterwards entrusted him\r\nwith important business. -- MARCELLUM: the captor of Syracuse in 212 B.C.\r\nHe fell into an ambush in 208 and was killed; Hannibal buried him with\r\nmilitary honors. -- CUIUS INTERITUM: abstract for concrete = _quem, post\r\ninteritum_. -- CRUDELISSIMUS HOSTIS: this, the traditional Roman view of\r\nHannibal, is the reverse of the truth, so far as extant testimony goes. See\r\nMommsen, Hist. of Rome, Bk. III. Ch. 4; Ihne, Hist. of Rome, Bk. IV. -- SED\r\n... ARBITRARENTUR: these words are almost exactly repeated in Tusc. 1, 89\r\nand 101. -- RUSTICI: cf. Arch. 24 _nostri illi fortes viri sed rustici ac\r\nmilites_; also above, 24.\r\n\r\n76. OMNINO: see n. on 9. -- NUM IGITUR etc.: cf. 33 _nisi forte et seq._ --\r\nCONSTANS: cf. n. on 33. -- NE ... QUIDEM: see n. on 27. -- SATIETAS VITAE:\r\ncf. 85 _senectus autem et seq._, and _satietas vivendi_ in pro Marc. 27;\r\nalso Tusc. 1, 109 _vita acta perficiat ut satis superque vixisse videamur_.\r\n\r\n77. CERNERE: of the mind also in 82. With the context cf. Div. 1, 63\r\n_animus appropinquante morte multo est divinior; facilius evenit\r\nappropinquante morte ut animi futura augurentur_. -- VESTROS PATRES: n. on\r\n15. The elder Laelius was prominent both as general and as statesman. He\r\ncommanded the fleet which co-operated with Scipio Africanus in Spain and\r\nafterwards served with honor in Africa. He was an intimate friend of Cato.\r\nSee Liv. 26, 42 _et seq._ -- TUQUE: so in Lael. 100 _C. Fanni et tu, Q.\r\nMuci_; but above, 4 and 9 simply _Scipio et Laeli_. -- QUAE EST SOLA VITA:\r\ncf. n. on _vitam nullam_ in 7. -- NAM DUM SUMUS etc.: the whole of this\r\ndoctrine is Platonic; cf. Lael. 13. -- MUNERE NECESSITATIS ET ... OPERE:\r\n'function and task allotted as by fate'.\r\n\r\nP. 32. -- IMMORTALIS: Cicero rarely mentions the gods without this epithet.\r\n-- SPARSISSE: Horace calls the soul _divinae particulam aurae_. --\r\nTUERENTUR: rule, or guard, or care for. Most editors wrongly take\r\n_tuerentur_ to be for _intuerentur_, 'to look upon', and regard it as an\r\nintentional archaism. But cf. Rep. 6, 15 (where no archaism can be\r\nintended): _homines sunt hac lege generati, qui tuerentur illum globum quae\r\nterra vocatur_; also _tuentur_ below in 82. -- CONTEMPLANTES IMITARENTUR:\r\nperhaps more Stoic than Platonic; the Stoics laid great stress on the\r\nethical value of a contemplation and imitation of the order of the\r\nuniverse. Cf. N.D. 2, 37 _ipse homo ortus est ad mundum contemplandum et\r\nimitandum_; Sen. Dial. 8, 5, 1 _Natura nos ad utrumque genuit, et\r\ncontemplationi rerum et actioni_. -- MODO: here _modus_ seems to be the\r\nPlatonic το μετριον, or perhaps a reminiscence of the Aristotelian doctrine\r\nof the mean (n. on 46). Translate 'in moderation and consistency of life';\r\nand cf. Off. 1, 93 _rerum modus_ 'moderation in all things'. For\r\n_constantia_ see n. on 4. -- ITA: cf. n. on 16 _et tamen sic_.\r\n\r\n78. PYTHAGORAN: see n. to 23. No ancient philosopher held more firmiy than\r\nPythagoras to belief in the immortality of the soul; it formed a part of\r\nhis doctrine of Metempsychosis. He was also noted for his numerical\r\nspeculations in Astronomy and Music. With him is said to have originated\r\nthe doctrine of the 'harmony of the spheres'. -- QUI ESSENT: 'inasmuch as\r\nthey were'. Cicero often tries to make out a connection between Pythagoras\r\nand the early Romans; cf. Tusc. 4, 2; also Liv. 1, 18. -- EX UNIVERSA\r\nMENTE: the world-soul. Diog. Laert 8 gives as Pythagorean the doctrine\r\nψυχην ειναι αποσπασμα του αιθερος και αθανατον. Similar doctrines occur in\r\nPlato and the Stoics; cf. Div. 1, 110 _a qua (i.e. a natura deorum) ut\r\ndoctissimis sapientissimisque placuit, haustos animos et libatos habemus_;\r\nTusc. 5, 38 _humanus animus decerptus ex mente divina_; Sen. Dial. 12, 6,\r\n7. -- HABEREMUS: imperfect where the English requires the present. A. 287,\r\n_d_; H. 495, V. -- SOCRATES: in Plato's Phaedo. -- IMMORTALITATE ANIMORUM:\r\nthis is commoner than _immortalitas animi_, for 'the immortality of the\r\nsoul'; so Lael. 14; Tusc. 1, 80 _aeternitas animorum_. -- DISSERUISSET:\r\nsubjunctive because involving the statements of some other person than the\r\nspeaker. A. 341, _c_; G. 630; H. 528, 1. -- IS QUI ESSET etc.: 'a man great\r\nenough to have been declared wisest'. See n. on Lael. 7 _Apollinis ...\r\niudicatum_. -- SIC: cf. _ita_ above. -- CELERITAS ANIMORUM: the ancients\r\npictured to themselves the mind as a substance capable of exceedingly rapid\r\nmovement; cf. Tusc. 1, 43 _nulla est celeritas quae possit cum animi\r\nceleritate contendere_. -- TANTAE SCIENTIAE: as the plural of _scientia_ is\r\nalmost unknown in classical Latin, recent editors take _scientiae_ here as\r\ngenitive, 'so many arts requiring so much knowledge'. In favor of this\r\ninterpretation are such passages as Acad. 2, 146 _artem sine scientia esse\r\nnon posse_; Fin. 5, 26 _ut omnes artes in aliqua scientia versentur_. Yet\r\nin De Or. 1, 61 _physica ista et mathematica et quae paulo ante ceterarum\r\nartium propria posuisti, scientiae sunt eorum qui illa profitentur_ it is\r\nvery awkward to take _scientiae_ as genitive. -- CUMQUE SEMPER etc.: this\r\nargument is copied very closely from Plato's Phaedrus, 245 C. -- PRINCIPIUM\r\nMOTUS: αρχη κινησεως in Plato. -- SE IPSE: cf. n. on 4 _a se ipsi_. -- CUM\r\nSIMPLEX etc: from Plato's Phaedo, 78-80. The general drift of the argument\r\nis this: material things decay because they are compounded of parts that\r\nfall asunder; there is nothing to show that the soul is so compounded;\r\ntherefore no reason to believe that it will so decay. Notice the imperfects\r\n_esset ... haberet ... posset_ accommodated to the tense of _persuasi_\r\nabove, although the other subjunctives in the sentence are not; cf. n. on\r\n42 _efficeret_. -- NEQUE ... DISSIMILE: in modern phraseology the whole of\r\nthis clause would be briefly expressed thus, -- 'and was homogeneous'. --\r\nPOSSET: _quod si_ ='whereas if', the subject of _posset_ being _animus_,\r\nand _dividi_ being understood. -- MAGNO ARGUMENTO: ‛ικανον τεκμηριον in Pl.\r\nPhaed. 72 A. Belief in the immortality of the soul naturally follows the\r\nacceptance of the doctrine of pre-existence. -- HOMINES SCIRE etc.: See\r\nPlato, Phaedo, 72 E-73 B. The notion that the souls of men existed before\r\nthe bodies with which they are connected has been held in all ages and has\r\noften found expression in literature. The English poets have not\r\ninfrequently alluded to it. See Wordsworth's Ode on the Intimations of\r\nImmortality from the Recollections of Early Childhood, 'Our birth is but a\r\nsleep and a forgetting' etc.; also, in Tennyson's Two Voices the passage\r\nbeginning, --\r\n\r\n  'Yet how should I for certain hold,\r\n  Because my memory is so cold,\r\n  That I first was in human mould?'\r\n\r\nREMINISCI ET RECORDARI: a double translation of Plato's αναμιμνησκεσθαι,\r\nquite in Cicero's fashion; the former word implies a momentary act, the\r\nlatter one of some duration. -- HAEC PLATONIS FERE: 'so far Plato'.\r\n\r\n79. APUD XENOPHONTEM: Cyropaedia, 8, 7, 17; for _apud_ cf. 30; when Cic.\r\nsays that a passage is 'in' a certain author (not naming the book) he uses\r\n_apud_, not _in_. -- MAIOR: 'the elder'; cf. 59 _Cyrum minorem_. -- NOLITE\r\nARBITRARI: a common periphrasis. A. 269, _a_, 2; G. 264, II.; H. 489, I. --\r\nDUM ERAM: the imperfect with _dum_ is not common; see Roby, 1458, _c_; A.\r\n276, _e_, n.; G. 572, 571; H. 519, I., 467, 4 with n.\r\n\r\nP. 33. -- 80. NEC ... TENEREMUS: the souls of the dead continue to exert an\r\ninfluence on the living, or else their fame would not remain; a weak\r\nargument. -- MIHI ... POTUIT: cf. 82 _nemo ... persuadebit_. -- VIVERE ...\r\nEMORI: adversative asyndeton. -- INSIPIENTEM: in Xen. αφρων, _i.e._ without\r\npower of thinking. -- SED: 'but rather that ...'. -- HOMINIS NATURA: a\r\nperiphrasis for _homo_; cf. Fin. 5, 33 _intellegant, si quando naturam\r\nhominis dicam, hominem dicere me; nihil enim hoc differt_. -- NIHIL ...\r\nSOMNUM: poets and artists from Homer (Il. 16, 682) onwards have pictured\r\ndeath as sleep's brother. Cf. Lessing, How the Ancients Represented Death.\r\n\r\n81. ATQUI: see n. on 6. -- DORMIENTIUM ANIMI etc.: see Div. 1, 60 where a\r\npassage of similar import is translated from Plato's Republic IX; ib. 115.\r\n-- REMISSI ET LIBERI: cf. Div. 1, 113 _animus solutus ac vacuus_; De Or. 2,\r\n193 _animo leni ac remisso_. -- CORPORIS: the singular, though _animi_\r\nprecedes; so in Lael. 13; Tusc. 2, 12, etc. -- PULCHRITUDINEM: κοσμον; Cic.\r\ntranslates it by _ornatus_ in Acad. 2, 119 where _hic ornatus_ corresponds\r\nto _hic mundus_ a little earlier. -- TUENTUR: see n. on 77 _tuerentur_. --\r\nSERVABITIS: future for imperative. A. 269, _f_; G. 265, 1; H. 487, 4.\r\n\r\n82. CYRUS etc.: see n. on 78. -- SI PLACET: cf. n. on 6 _nisi molestum\r\nest_. -- NOSTRA: = _Romana = domestica_ in 12. -- NEMO etc.: this line of\r\nargument is often repeated in Cic.; see Tusc. 1, 32 _et seq._; Arch. 29. --\r\nDUOS AVOS ... PATRUUM: see nn. on 29. -- MULTOS: _sc. alios_. -- ESSE\r\nCONATOS: loosely put for _fuisse conaturos_, as below, _suscepturum\r\nfuisse_. So in the direct narration we might have, though exceptionally,\r\n_non conabantur nisi cernerent_ for _non conati essent nisi vidissent_. --\r\nCERNERENT: see n. on 13 quaereretur. -- UT ... GLORIER: in Arch. 30 Cic.\r\nmakes the same reflections in almost the same words about his own\r\nachievements. -- ALIQUID: see n. on 1 _quid_.\r\n\r\nP. 34. -- SI ISDEM etc.: cf. Arch. 29 _si nihil animus praesentiret ...\r\ndimicaret_. -- AETATEM: = _vitam_. -- TRADUCERE: cf. Tusc. 3, 25 _volumus\r\nhoc quod datum est vitae tranquille placideque traducere_. -- NESCIO QUO\r\nMODO: A. 210, _f_, Rem.; G. 469, Rem. 2; H. 529, 5, 3). -- ERIGENS SE:\r\nAcad. 2, 127 _erigimur, elatiores fieri videmur_. -- HAUD ... NITERETUR: in\r\nCicero's speeches _haud_ scarcely occurs except before adverbs and the verb\r\n_scio_; in the philosophical writings and in the Letters before many other\r\nverbs. -- IMMORTALITATIS GLORIAM: so Balb. 16 _sempiterni nominis gloriam_.\r\nCf. also Arch. 26 _trahimur omnes studio laudis et optimus quisque maxime\r\ngloria ducitur_.\r\n\r\n83. NON VIDERE: either _non videre_ or _non item_ was to be expected, as\r\nCicero does not often end sentences or clauses with _non_. -- COLUI ET\r\nDILEXI: so 26 _coluntur et diliguntur_. -- VIDENDI: Cic. for the most part\r\navoids the genitive plural of the gerundive in agreement with a noun, and\r\nuses the gerund as here. Meissner notes that Latin has no verb with the\r\nsense 'to see again', which a modern would use here. -- CONSCRIPSI: in the\r\n_Origines_. -- QUO: = _ad quos_; see n. on 12 _fore unde_. -- PELIAN: a\r\nmistake of Cicero's. It was not Pelias but his half-brother Aeson, father\r\nof Iason, whom Medea made young again by cutting him to pieces and boiling\r\nhim in her enchanted cauldron. She, however, induced the daughters of\r\nPelias to try the same experiment with their father; the issue, of course,\r\nwas very different. Plautus, Pseud. 3, 2, 80 seems to make the same\r\nmistake. -- SI QUIS DEUS: the present subjunctive is noticeable; strictly,\r\nan impossible condition should require the past tense, but in vivid\r\npassages an impossible condition is momentarily treated as possible. So\r\nCic. generally says _si reviviscat aliquis_, not _revivisceret_. -- DECURSO\r\nSPATIO: 'when I have run my race'. See n. on 14. Lucretius 3, 1042 oddly\r\nhas _decurso lumine vitae_. -- AD CARCERES A CALCE: _carceres_ were the\r\nbarriers behind which the horses and cars stood waiting for the race;\r\n_calx_ (γραμμη), literally 'a chalked line', was what we should call 'the\r\nwinning post'. Cf. Lael. 101; Tusc. 1, 15 _nunc video calcem ad quam cum\r\nsit decursum, nihil sit praeterea extimescendum._\r\n\r\n84. HABEAT: concessive. A. 266, _c_; G. 257; H. 484, 3. -- MULTI ET EI\r\nDOCTI: as Nägelsbach, Stilistik § 25, 5, remarks, Cic. always uses this\r\nphrase and not _multi docti_. One of the books Cic. has in view is no doubt\r\nthat of Hegesias, a Cyrenaic philosopher, mentioned in Tusc. 1, 84. --\r\nCOMMORANDI ... DIVORSORIUM: 'a hostelry wherein to sojourn'. The idea has\r\nbeen expressed in literature in a thousand ways. Cf. Lucr. 3, 938 _cur non\r\nut plenus vitae conviva recedis_; Hor. Sat. 1, 1, 118 _vita cedat uti\r\nconviva satur_. Cicero often insists that heaven is the _vera aeternaque\r\ndomus_ of the soul (cf. Tusc. 1, 118). Cf. Epist. to the Hebrews, 13, 14\r\n'Here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come'. -- CONCILIUM\r\nCOETUMQUE: so in Rep. 6, 13 _concilia coetusque hominum quae civitates\r\nvocantur_. The words here seem to imply that the real _civitas_ is above;\r\nwhat seems to men a _civitas_ is merely a disorganized crowd.\r\n\r\nP. 35. -- CATONEM MEUM: see 15, 68; so Cicero in his letters often calls\r\nhis own son _meus Cicero_. -- NEMO VIR: see n. on 21 _quemquam senem_. --\r\nQUOD CONTRA: = ‛ο τουναντιον, 'whereas on the contrary'; cf. n. on Lael. 90\r\nwhere, as well as here, many of the editors make the mistake of taking\r\n_quod_ to be the accusative governed by _contra_ out of place. -- MEUM:\r\n_sc. corpus cremari_. -- QUO: put for _ad quae_, as often. -- VISUS SUM:\r\n'people thought I bore up bravely'. -- NON QUO ... SED: a relative clause\r\nparallel with a categorically affirmative clause. The usage is not\r\nuncommon, though Cic. often has _non quo ... sed quia_. For mood of\r\n_ferrem_ see A. 341, _d_, Rem.; G. 541, Rem. 1.; H. 516, II. 2.\r\n\r\n85. DIXISTI: in 4. -- QUI: here = _cum ego_, 'since I ...'. -- EXTORQUERI\r\nVOLO: n. on 2 _levari volo_. -- MINUTI PHILOSOPHI: for the word _minutus_\r\ncf. n. on 46; Cic. has _minuti philosophi_ in Acad. 2, 75; Div. 1, 62; in\r\nFin. 1, 61 _minuti et angusti (homines)_; in Brut. 265 _m. imperatores_;\r\ncf. Suet. Aug. 83 _m. pueri_. -- SENTIAM: future indicative. -- PERACTIO:\r\nthe noun is said to occur only here in Cic.; cf. however 64 _peragere_; 70.\r\n-- HAEC ... DICEREM: the same words occur at the end of the Laelius; for\r\n_habeo quod dicam_ Cic. often says _habeo dicere_, as in Balb. 34.\r\n\r\n[1] Horace, Ep. 2, 1, 156:--\r\n\r\n  _Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit, et artes\r\n  Intulit agresti Latio._\r\n\r\n[2] De Off. 1, 1 2: _philosophandi scientiam concedens multis_ etc.\r\n\r\n[3] To judge rightly of Cicero it must be remembered that he was a\r\npolitician only by accident: his whole natural bent was towards literature.\r\n\r\n[4] To see the truth of this it is only necessary to refer for example to\r\nthe weight given to the opinions of Cicero in the heated political\r\ndiscussions of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\r\n\r\n[5] Almost every branch of learning was ranked under the head of\r\nPhilosophy. Strabo even claimed that one branch of Philosophy was\r\nGeography.\r\n\r\n[6] 2, 3 _interiectus est nuper liber is quem ad nostrum Atticum de\r\nsenectute misimus._ No argument can be founded on the words _interiectus\r\nest_, over which the editors have wasted much ingenuity. They simply mean\r\n'there was inserted in the series of my works'.\r\n\r\n[7] See 2, 23.\r\n\r\n[8] 14, 21, 3; 16, 3, 1; 16, 11, 3.\r\n\r\n[9] See Att. 14, 21, 1.\r\n\r\n[10] It was certainly not written, as Sommerbrodt assumes, in the intervals\r\nof composing the _De Divinatione_. The words in 2, 7 of that work--_quoniam\r\nde re publica consuli coepti sumus_ etc.--point to the end of September or\r\nbeginning of October, 44, when Cicero returned to Rome and began to compose\r\nhis Philippic orations.\r\n\r\n[11] § 1.\r\n\r\n[12] It is perhaps not a mere accident that the prowess of L. Brutus _in\r\nliberanda patria_ is mentioned in § 75. There may be a reference to the\r\nlatest Brutus who had freed his country.\r\n\r\n[13] In March, 45.\r\n\r\n[14] § 12.\r\n\r\n[15] § 84.\r\n\r\n[16] See p. iii. above.\r\n\r\n[17] In the notes exact references will be given to the places in the\r\noriginal where the other passages mentioned may be found.\r\n\r\n[18] Particularly the first book of the _Tusculan Disputations_, the _De\r\nRepublica_, and the _Laelius_.\r\n\r\n[19] See 4, below.\r\n\r\n[20] § 3.\r\n\r\n[21] Works on Old Age are said to have been written by Theophrastus and\r\nDemetrius Phalereus, either or both of which Cicero might have used. One\r\npassage in § 67, _facilius in morbos ... tristius curantur_, is supposed by\r\nmany to have been imitated from Hippocrates; but the resemblance is\r\nprobably accidental. Cf. De Off. 1, 24, 83.\r\n\r\n[22] See § 2.\r\n\r\n[23] See Att. 16, 11, 3; 16, 3, 1; 14, 21, 3.\r\n\r\n[24] § 2.\r\n\r\n[25] As Cicero's intention was to set old age in a favorable light, he\r\nslights Aristo Cius for giving to Tithonus the chief part in a dialogue on\r\nold age. See § 3; cf. also Laelius, § 4.\r\n\r\n[26] See below (ii.), 1.\r\n\r\n[27] On the whole subject of Aristotle's dialogues see Bernays' monograph,\r\n_Die Dialoge des Aristoteles_.\r\n\r\n[28] § 32 _quartum ago annum et octogesimum_. Cf. Lael. 11 _memini Catonem\r\nante quam est mortuus mecum et cum Scipione disserere_ etc.\r\n\r\n[29] Cicero always indicates this date; cf. § 14. Some other writers, as\r\nLivy, give, probably wrongly, an earlier date.\r\n\r\n[30] He himself says (Festus, p.28l) _ego iam a principio in parsimonia\r\natque in duritia atque industria omnem adulescentiam, abstinui agro\r\ncolendo, saxis Sabinis silicibus repastinandis atque conserendis_. Cf.\r\nGell. _Noct. Att._ 13, 23.\r\n\r\n[31] See Cat. M. 44.\r\n\r\n[32] Plut. C. 1; Cat. M. §§ 18, 32: Cato himself ap. Fest. s.v.\r\n_ordinarius_ says _quid mihi fieret si non ego stipendia in ordine omnia\r\nordinarius meruissem semper?_\r\n\r\n[33] § 10.\r\n\r\n[34] If Plutarch may be trusted, Cato at the age of 30 had won for himself\r\nthe title of 'the Roman Demosthenes'.\r\n\r\n[35] § 10.\r\n\r\n[36] In § 10 Cicero makes the quaestorship fall in 205, but he refers to\r\nthe election, not to the actual year of office.\r\n\r\n[37] Nepos (or pseudo-Nepos), Cat. 1.\r\n\r\n[38] Cato afterwards made it a charge against M. Fulvius Nobilior that he\r\nhad taken Ennius with him on a campaign (Tusc. 1, 3). But Cato used Ennius\r\nas soldier while Nobilior employed him as poet.\r\n\r\n[39] It is difficult, however, to fix the date of this enactment. Some\r\nauthorities place it after Cato's return from Spain.\r\n\r\n[40] Livy 34, cc. 1-8.\r\n\r\n[41] See Livy, 34, 18.\r\n\r\n[42] _i.e._ he was _legatus consularis_. It was at the time a common thing\r\nfor ex-consuls to take service under their successors. So Liv. 36, 17, 1,\r\nbut Cic. Cat. M. c 10 says _tribunus militaris_.\r\n\r\n[43] Cicero's statements throughout the treatise concerning the relations\r\nbetween Cato and Africanus the elder, particularly in § 77 where Cato calls\r\nhis enemy _amicissimus_, are audaciously inexact.\r\n\r\n[44] See Cato M. § 42.\r\n\r\n[45] We possess the titles of 26 speeches delivered during or concerning\r\nhis censorship.\r\n\r\n[46] He is said to have undergone 44 prosecutions, and to have been\r\nprosecutor as often.\r\n\r\n[47] See Lael. 9; Cat. M. 12 and 84.\r\n\r\n[48] Cf. Livy, 39, 40.\r\n\r\n[49] The common view is that Cato said nothing of Roman history from\r\n509-266 B.C.\r\n\r\n[50] Cf. Cic. pro Arch. 7, 16.\r\n\r\n[51] See Coulanges, 'Ancient City', Bk. II. Ch. 4.\r\n\r\n[52] See §§ 12, 41 etc.\r\n\r\n[53] De Or. 2, 170; Fam. 9, 21, 3; Qu. Fr. 2, 3, 3.\r\n\r\n[54] In _De Re Publica_ 2, 1 Cicero makes Scipio talk extravagantly of\r\nCato.\r\n\r\n[55] See Introduction to the Laelius, pp. vi, vii.\r\n\r\n[56] A. = Allen and Greenough's Grammar, Revised Ed.; G. = Gildersleeve's\r\nGrammar; H. = Harkness's Grammar, Rev. Ed. of 1881.
