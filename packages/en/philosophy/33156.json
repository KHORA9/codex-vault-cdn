There had passed over the land the\r\nthunderstorm of the Puritanic Revolt, which had first clouded and then\r\ncleared, for a season, the intellectual and moral horizon. The effect of\r\nthis on poetry was, for such fugitive though felicitous hymns as those of\r\nHerbert, to substitute the epic unities and grand choral harmonies of\r\nMilton. Then came the Restoration--the Apotheosis of falsehood; including\r\nin that term false principles, false politics, and false taste. Britain\r\nbecame the degraded slave of France, at once in laws and in literature.\r\nDryden, indeed, maintained, in some measure, the character and the taste\r\nof his nation, but he stood almost alone. To him succeeded Addison and\r\nPope, both gifted but both timid men, whose genius, great as it was,\r\nnever, or rarely, ventured on original and daring flights, and who seemed\r\nalways to be haunted by the fear of French criticism. Pope, especially,\r\nlent all his influence to confirm and seal the power of a foreign code of\r\nliterary laws; and so general and so deep was the submission, that it is\r\nto us one of the strongest proofs of Edward Young's genius, that he\r\nventured, in that polished but powerless era, to uplift a native voice of\r\nsong, and not to uplift it in vain; for, if he did not absolutely make a\r\nrevolution, or found a school, he yet established himself, and left his\r\npoetry as a glorious precedent to all who should afterwards be so hardy\r\nas to \"go and do likewise.\"\r\n\r\nEdward Young was born in June 1681 (according to some, two years\r\nearlier), in the village of Upham, Hampshire. His father was rector of\r\nthe parish, and is represented as a man of great learning and abilities.\r\nHe was the author of some volumes of sermons, and, on account of their\r\nmerit, and through the patronage of Lord Bradford, he was appointed\r\nchaplain to King William, and Dean of Salisbury. He died in 1705, in the\r\nsixty-third year of his age, and Bishop Burnet, the Sunday after his\r\ndecease, pronounced a glowing panegyric on his character, in a funeral\r\nsermon delivered in the Cathedral.\r\n\r\nEdward was sent to Winchester School, and thence to Oxford, where he\r\nobtained a law fellowship in All-Souls College, and afterwards took\r\nsuccessively the degrees of Bachelor and Doctor of Civil Law, besides\r\nobtaining a fellowship in 1706. When the Codrington Library was founded,\r\nhe was appointed to deliver the Latin oration. It was published, but met\r\nwith a frigid reception, being full of conceits and puerilities, and the\r\nauthor wisely omitted it from his collected works. Little else is known\r\nof his career at College. He is said to have blended fits of study with\r\nfrequent dissipation. When he relaxed, it was in the company of the\r\ninfamous Duke of Wharton, who patronised, corrupted, and laughed at him.\r\nWhen he studied, he would shut his windows, create around him an\r\nartificial night, and make it more hideous by piling up skulls,\r\ncross-bones, and instruments of death in his room. His talent was then as\r\nwell known as his eccentricity. Tindal the sceptic bore a striking\r\ntestimony to this when he said, \"The other boys I can always answer,\r\nbecause I always know where they have their arguments, which I have read\r\na hundred times; but that fellow Young is continually pestering me with\r\nsomething of his own.\"\r\n\r\nHe seems to have been nearly thirty ere he began to tune that lyre which\r\nwas afterwards to thrill with vibrations of song so powerful and\r\nmelodious. His first choice of a subject was characteristic of the lofty\r\nand ambitious tone of his genius: it was, \"The Last Day.\" This poem was\r\nwritten in 1710, although not given to the world till 1713. He had\r\npreviously, in 1712, published an epistle to Lord Lansdown, which\r\ndisplayed little of his peculiar power, but was at once feeble and\r\npretentious. Young became afterwards heartily ashamed of it. In the same\r\nyear that \"The Last Day\" appeared, he prefixed to Addison's \"Cato\" a copy\r\nof verses of no great merit. Shortly after, he issued a poem entitled,\r\n\"The Force of Religion; or, Vanquished Love:\" it was founded on the story\r\nof Lady Jane Grey and her husband, and was ushered in by a flaming\r\ndedication to the Countess of Salisbury. On the death of the Queen, in\r\n1714, he published a panegyric in verse on her memory, and inscribed it\r\nto Addison. In these days flattery to princes and nobles was a commodity\r\nalmost essential to poetry--a tawdry court dress which every poet was\r\nobliged to put on for the nonce; and not even Dryden has excelled Young\r\nin the violent unlikeness and unsparing incense of his adulations. It is\r\nsatisfactory to remember that, on cool reflection, he cancelled the most\r\nof those unworthy effusions; although he continued to the last very much\r\nof a courtier, as the dedications to the \"Night Thoughts\" sufficiently\r\nprove. He is supposed about the year 1717 to have visited Ireland in\r\ncompany with Wharton.\r\n\r\nIn 1719 his tragedy of \"Busiris\" appeared on the stage, and had\r\nconsiderable success. He sold the copyright afterwards to B. Lintot, for\r\nL84, which, for a first play by an author previously unknown, was thought\r\na large sum. \"Busiris\" is a play of that solemnly pompous and intensely\r\nartificial school, the race of which has been long since gathered to its\r\nfathers. It is conceived and written in Ercles' vein;[1] and Nat Lee\r\nhimself, in his wild ranting plays, has scarcely surpassed the torrents\r\nof bombastic nonsense which issue from the lips of Myron. Immediately\r\nafter \"Busiris\" he published his Paraphrase on part of the Book of Job, a\r\nproduction scarcely worthy either of Young or of the sublime original.\r\nThe descriptions in that grandest of all poems, which are so rich and\r\nmassive as to press almost on the sense, are more fairly represented in\r\nour common prose translation than in the poetical paraphrase of Young. We\r\nare far, however, from being opposed, with some critics, to the principle\r\nof paraphrasing Scripture. We admire to enthusiasm many of the Scottish\r\nparaphrases, some of Byron's and Moore's Hebrew Melodies, and Croly's\r\n_Scenes from Scripture_; and should like to see all the poetry of the\r\nBible versified by some competent hand.\r\n\r\nIn 1721 appeared \"The Revenge,\" by far the most powerful of his\r\ntragedies. Its great fault lies in its likeness to Othello: its great\r\npraise is, that, though it imitates and challenges comparison with that\r\nShakspearean masterpiece, it has not been utterly sunk and eclipsed\r\nbefore it. As a play, we think it decidedly second-rate; the plot is not\r\nartistically managed, and the means by which jealousy is excited in the\r\nmind of Alonzo, are a very poor and shabby copy of those in Shakspeare.\r\nZanga has been called a \"vulgar caricature of Iago;\" he is so in part,\r\nperhaps, but Young has abated the vulgarity of the imitation by endowing\r\nhis hero with a wild and native vein of poetry. Iago is a subtler, colder\r\nfiend than Zanga, and indulges more in sneers and in smut than in\r\ndeclamation. Zanga's speeches exhaust the rhetoric of revenge. Iago has\r\nnothing but intellect, wit, and malignity. Zanga has an imagination\r\nworthy of the hot and lion-peopled land of his birth. Iago, after his\r\ndetection, sinks into obstinate silence; he stiffens into the statue of a\r\ndemon. Zanga dies, using lofty imagery.\r\n\r\nIndeed, \"The Revenge\" owes all its interest to the flames of poetic\r\ngenius which burst out at every pore of its otherwise coarse and copied\r\nstructure. It was dedicated to Wharton, with whom Young continued to be\r\nintimate; whom he taught to speak good Latin _in the space of six weeks_;\r\nand who lent him money to reimburse him for the expenses of an\r\nunsuccessful attempt to get into Parliament. This was in 1721; the place\r\nwas Cirencester. The election, however, was contested, and fortunately,\r\nperhaps, both for Young and the world, he was unsuccessful. Had he gained\r\nthe seat, he had very probably,\r\n\r\n  \"Though born for the universe, narrow'd his mind,\r\n  And to party given up what was meant for mankind;\"\r\n\r\nand what comparison between a series of eloquent, forgotten speeches, and\r\nthe starry, ever-burning splendours of the \"Night Thoughts\"?\r\n\r\nHis disappointment in this attempt, coupled, probably, with remorse for\r\nthe follies and vices of a misspent youth, seems to have soured Young,\r\nand ripened him to the point when satire becomes the unavoidable\r\nexpression of the irritated yet unsubdued spirit. In 1725 appeared the\r\nfirst part of his \"Universal Passion;\" the rest came out in successive\r\nsatires between that and 1728, when they were collected and published,\r\nalong with a somewhat querulous preface, in which he hints that he had\r\nnot found poetry very favourable to preferment. He gained, however, L3000\r\nby these poems, of which, according to Spence, L2000 was contributed by\r\nthe Duke of Grafton, who did not, however, regret the price. His\r\ninscriptions of the several satires were, as usual at the time, stuffed\r\nwith fulsome praise of such men as Dorset, Dodington, Campton, and Sir\r\nRobert Walpole, all of whom appreciated and rewarded the compliments. We\r\nreserve our criticism on these remarkable productions till afterwards,\r\nnoticing only at present, that they were published _before_ the satires\r\nof Pope, and that they became instantly popular.\r\n\r\nAs if to propitiate the Nemesis, who always stands behind the chariot of\r\nthe popular writer, Young next issued two of the poorest of all his\r\nunequal productions. The first of these, entitled \"The Instalment,\" was\r\naddressed to Sir Robert Walpole, and is, perhaps, although the word be a\r\nwide one, the most nonsensical and trashy _lie in verse_ ever addressed\r\nto a prime minister. The second is an \"Ode to Ocean,\" a compound of\r\ndoggrel and stilted dulness--which, indeed, any sailor of education might\r\nhave composed, if \"half-seas-over.\"\r\n\r\nAt length, sick of dissipation, of the stage, of bad odes, and good\r\nsatires, Young determined to become wise, and enter into orders. An\r\nirresistible current had long been carrying him on, with many a\r\nconvulsive recalcitration on his part, to this determination. That great\r\nintellect and heart, over which, already, the shadow of the \"Night\r\nThoughts\" was beginning to gather, could not be satisfied with the\r\nsociety of \"peers, poets,\" and demireps; with the applause of sweltering\r\ncrowds collected in theatres; or with the ebullitions of its own giant\r\nspleen, in the shape of epigrammatic satires. The world, which once\r\nseemed to his eye so fresh and fair, had withered gradually to a\r\nskeleton, with sockets for eyes, with eternal baldness for hair, with a\r\n\"stench instead of a sweet savour, and burning instead of beauty.\" He\r\nresolved to proclaim the particulars of this painful yet blessed\r\ndisenchantment to the ends of the earth, and to all classes of mankind.\r\nAnd for this purpose, he first of all mounted the pulpit, and then began\r\nto wield what was even then the mightier engine of the press. He was no\r\nnovice when he entered the ministry. Would that we had more who, like\r\nYoung, do not go up by a mechanical ladder, and the mere force of custom,\r\nto the pulpit, but who come down upon it from long and vain wanderings\r\nelsewhere, and with a conviction, as the result of mature experience,\r\nthat God there still desires to dwell, and that it constitutes even yet a\r\npinnacle of prospect, and power, and promise! Thus came Herbert, and\r\nChalmers, and Foster, to their real work as ministers of the gospel. It\r\nis not a boy, but a Boanerges-ministry that introduces the Word with most\r\neffect to a gainsaying world. Young was full forty-seven--mature in\r\nyears, in acquirements, in experience, and in reputation--when he began\r\nto publish the \"News that it is well.\" Like the eminent men we have just\r\nmentioned, and like others whom we might mention, his motives in entering\r\nthe Church have been calumniated. He has been compared to a lady\r\ndisappointed in love, taking the veil; and, rather inconsistently with\r\nthis figure, to a sated sensualist becoming an anchorite. How can both be\r\ntrue? If Young was disappointed, how could he be sated? and if sated, how\r\ncould he be chagrined by the want of satisfaction? The fact is, that such\r\nmen as Young, Chalmers, Herbert, and Foster, are altogether superior to\r\ncommon standards of judgment, and must be tried by their peers. All had\r\ntheir own share of the disgusts and dissatisfactions connected with life,\r\nand all felt them keenly. But all had a deeper reason still--a reason, we\r\ngrant, probably stirred by circumstances into action, for renouncing the\r\nempty arena of this world's honours and wealth, and devoting themselves\r\nto a higher and nobler purpose. They all saw into the hollowness of\r\nsociety, into the misery of the human heart; and felt that the gospel\r\nalone could fill that aching void, and satisfy those dreary cravings.\r\nHence, Herbert quitted the pleasures of a court; Chalmers dropped his\r\nair-pump and his telescope; Foster resigned his philosophic speculations;\r\nand Young shook off the blandishments of peers, and forgot the claps of\r\nmultitudes, to proclaim the glad tidings to perishing sinners; and verily\r\nall, in different measures, had their reward.\r\n\r\nIn April 1728 he was appointed chaplain to George II. His tragedy, \"The\r\nBrothers,\" which had been in rehearsal, was prudently withdrawn. It is a\r\nplay superior to \"Busiris,\" but very much inferior to \"The Revenge.\" Full\r\nof passion and poetry, of startling scenes, and vivid images, its subject\r\nis unpleasing, and the various perplexities of the plot are not skilfully\r\ndisentangled.\r\n\r\nIn the same year he published \"A True Estimate of Human Life,\" written\r\nwith force and ingenuity; and a long and very loyal sermon, preached\r\nbefore the House of Commons, on the Martyrdom of Charles I. It was\r\nentitled, \"An Apology for Princes; or, the Reverence due to Governments.\"\r\n\r\nHitherto Young had lived on the proceeds of his fellowship, and on\r\npresents from Wharton, who, at his death, too, left him a pension. He\r\nbecame now, however, very naturally anxious for promotion in that new\r\nsphere on which he had entered, and was compelled, _proh pudor_! to lay\r\nhis case before Mrs Howard, the favourite mistress of George II.--that\r\nidentical \"good Howard,\" who figures so curiously in the famous scene\r\nbetween Jeanie Deans and Queen Caroline. The fact of the application, as\r\nwell as the terms of the letter he wrote her, renders this the most\r\nhumiliating incident in all Young's history. In 1730, he published\r\n\"Imperium Pelagi,\" another naval lyric, as bad and much longer than his\r\n\"Ode to Ocean.\" In the same year he wrote an epistle to Pope, which\r\nresembles a coarser and more careless production of the little man of\r\nTwickenham.\r\n\r\nIn July 1730, Young was presented by his college to the rectory of Welwyn\r\nin Hertfordshire. We refer our readers, for various delightful\r\nspeculations and anecdotes about his residence and labours there, to\r\nBulwer's _Student_. He was a powerful preacher. His sermons seem to have\r\nbeen striking in thought, rich in image, intensely practical in tendency,\r\nand were delivered with great animation and effect. It is told, that on\r\none occasion, while preaching at St James's before the Court and His\r\nMajesty, on some subject of transcendent importance, and not being able\r\nto command the attention or awaken the feelings of his audience, he at\r\nlength threw himself back into the pulpit, and burst into tears. That was\r\nitself a sermon! The figure of this weeping Titan, who could have rent\r\nrocks and severed mountains, but who had failed in breaking the hearts of\r\nany of his courtly hearers, is one of the most affecting in the annals of\r\npulpit oratory. Alas! what preacher who has ever aimed at Young's object,\r\nhas not been at times tempted to assume Young's attitude, and to shed\r\nYoung's bitter and burning tears? \"Who hath believed our report, and to\r\nwhom is the arm of the Lord revealed?\"\r\n\r\nIn 1731, Young, at the mature age of fifty, married the Lady Elizabeth\r\nLee, daughter of the Earl of Lichfield, and widow of Colonel Lee. This\r\nmarriage sprung out of his father's acquaintance with Lady Ann Wharton,\r\nwho was co-heiress of Sir Henry Lee of Ditchley in Oxfordshire, and seems\r\nto have been very happy. He next published another of those stupid odes\r\nby which he seemed predestined to disgrace his genius, entitled \"A Sea\r\nPiece.\" It was as though Milton had tried to write Anacreontics. A few\r\nyears afterwards appeared \"The Foreign Address, or the Best Argument for\r\nPeace,\" occasioned by the posture of affairs in which the British fleet\r\nwas then placed, and written in the character of a sailor. It is a mere\r\ntissue of sounding verbiage--or, as Hamlet hath it, \"Words, words,\r\nwords.\" About this time Young met with Voltaire, who, according to the\r\nstory, was ridiculing Milton's allegory of \"Death and Sin,\" when our hero\r\nstruck in with the extempore epigram:--\r\n\r\n  \"Thou art so witty, profligate, and thin,\r\n  That thou thyself art Milton, Death, and Sin.\"\r\n\r\nWe cannot see very much wit in this epigram, even in that best shape\r\nwhich we have now given it; but it was not inappropriate to the lean\r\ndenier, who sought to empty everything of the important element--its God;\r\nto leave the universe, like himself, a grinning skeleton, and to smile in\r\nghastly sympathy over the completed ruin. We fancy we see the two gifted\r\nmen, the one the representative of the scepticism of France, the other,\r\nof the belief of England, meeting and conversing together. Voltaire is\r\nnot much in advance of thirty; Young is fifty, and more. Voltaire's face\r\nis worn with premature thought and inordinate laughter; Young's, though\r\nolder, bears a warmer and more sanguine flush. Voltaire has the\r\ninsincerest of smiles playing constantly over his face like the light of\r\nan aurora borealis; Young's countenance is grave, settled, open, and\r\nserene, as the radiance of an autumn sunset. In Voltaire's eye you see\r\nthe future \"Candide\" laughing down in its depths, while on Young's brow\r\nlies the dim and magnificent promise of the \"Night Thoughts.\" After\r\nmeeting, talking, bowing, wondering, and recoiling, they part for ever;\r\nVoltaire sighing through smiles as he thinks of the \"misled giant of\r\nReligion;\" and Young smiling through sighs as he thinks of the \"wondrous\r\nand well-nigh human ape of Infidelity.\"\r\n\r\nBy his wife Young had one son, Frederick. He does not seem to have been a\r\nparticularly well-behaved youth; indeed, his father for some time before\r\nhis death refused to see him, although he ultimately sent him his\r\nforgiveness, and made him his heir. But no son of illustrious father has\r\never had harder measure dealt him. It has been generally supposed that he\r\nwas the Lorenzo of the \"Night Thoughts,\" a poem published when Frederick\r\nwas only eight years of age, and when he could scarcely have even thought\r\nof committing those crimes of scepticism and reckless self-gratification\r\nwith which Young charges his imaginary or half-real hero.\r\n\r\nThe Poet's life, during the first ten years of his rectorship at Welwyn,\r\nflowed on in an even tenor. He was regular in his conduct, happy in his\r\nfamily, diligent in his pastoral duties, and easy in his fortune. His\r\npreaching was popular and useful. His studies were principally connected\r\nwith his own profession, and yielded him a growing satisfaction. An\r\nanonymous writer in the _Gentleman's Magazine_ for 1782, who seems to\r\nhave been intimate with him, thus describes him:--\"The dignity of a great\r\nand good mind appeared in all his actions, and in all his words. He\r\nconversed on religious subjects with the cheerfulness of virtue; his\r\npiety was undebased by gloom or enthusiasm; he was regular in the\r\nperformance of all its duties, both in public and in private. In his\r\ndomestic character he was amiable as he was venerable in the Christian.\r\nHis politeness was such as I never saw equalled: it was invariable to his\r\nsuperiors in rank; to his equals and to his inferiors it differed only in\r\ndegrees of elegance. I never heard him speak with roughness to the\r\nmeanest servant. In conversation upon lively subjects he had a brilliancy\r\nof wit which was peculiar to himself; I know not how to describe it but\r\nby saying that it was both heightened and softened by the amiable\r\nqualities of his soul. I have seen him ill and in pain, yet the serenity\r\nof his mind remained unruffled. I never heard a peevish expression fall\r\nfrom his lips.\" Few of his brilliancies are preserved, since,\r\nunfortunately, he had no Boswell attached to his heels. But one or two of\r\nthe sayings that have floated down to us are singularly characteristic.\r\nOn one very stormy night Young went out to his garden, and remained some\r\ntime. When he returned, one expressed wonder why he had stayed so long in\r\nsuch an evening. \"Oh,\" he replied, \"it is a very fine night; _the Lord is\r\nabroad_.\" He was very fond of a garden, and inscribed on the wall of his\r\nsummer-house the words, _Ambulantes in horto audiebant vocem Dei_\r\n(Walking in the garden, they heard the voice of God). He had also erected\r\na dial with the inscription, _Eheu fugaces!_ which, he said with a smile\r\nto Mr Langton, \"was sadly verified, for by the next morning my dial had\r\nbeen carried off.\" Though sometimes melancholy, he was disposed to\r\nencourage mirth in others, and established an assembly and bowling-green\r\nin his parish.\r\n\r\nAnd had this been all--had Young continued to pursue such an even,\r\nequable course--he had been by this time well-nigh forgotten; for we do\r\nnot think that either his satires or plays would of themselves have\r\npreserved his name. But it was decreed that grief should co-operate with\r\ndisappointment in unfolding the full riches of his mind. Antaeus was\r\nstrongest when he touched the ground. Job was never so eloquent till he\r\nwas prostrated on his dunghill. And, in order to be able to write the\r\n\"Night Thoughts,\" Young must be plunged in the deepest gloom of\r\naffliction--\"Thrice flew the shaft, and thrice his peace was slain.\" In\r\n1736, a daughter of his wife, by a former husband, died. This was Mrs\r\nTemple--the Narcissa of his great poem. Her disease was a lingering one.\r\nYoung accompanied her to Lyons, where she died, and where her remains\r\nwere brutally denied sepulture, as the dust of a Protestant. Her husband,\r\nMr Temple, or Philander, died four years later; and in 1741, Young's\r\nwife, or Lucia, also expired. He now felt himself alone, and blasted in\r\nhis solitude. But his grief did not sink into sullen inactivity. He made\r\nit oracular, and distilled his tears into song. The \"Night Thoughts\" were\r\nimmediately commenced, and published between 1742 and 1744. This\r\nmarvellous poem was all composed either at night, or when riding on\r\nhorseback--an exercise, by the way, which gives a sense of mastery and\r\nconfidence, stirs the blood, elevates the animal spirits, and has been\r\nfelt by many to be eminently favourable to thought and mental\r\ncomposition. It inspired, we know, such men as Burns, Byron, Shelley, and\r\nDelta. We love to think of Young riding through the green lanes of his\r\nparish, and cooing out to himself his plaintive minstrelsies. We love\r\nbetter still to watch his lonely lamp shining at midnight, like a star,\r\nthrough the darkness, and seeming to answer the far signal of those\r\nmightier luminaries which are burning above in the Great Bear and\r\nOrion--the poet the while now dipping his pen to indite his ardent\r\nimmortalities--now leaning his head on his widowed arm, and surrendering\r\nhimself to paroxysms of uncontrollable anguish--and now looking out upon\r\nthe Night as the \"Lord is abroad\" on the wings of the tempest, or as He\r\nis silently shining out his name in suns and galaxies--those unwearied\r\n\"Watchers\" and unbaptized \"Holy Ones.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1745, Young wrote \"Reflections on the Public Situation of the\r\nKingdom\"--a production which made no impression at the time, and is now\r\nentirely forgotten. He did not include it in the collection of his works.\r\nIn 1753, the tragedy of \"The Brothers,\" which had lain past for thirty\r\nyears, was produced on the stage. Young gave the profits of the play, and\r\nseveral hundreds from his own pocket, amounting to a thousand pounds in\r\nall, to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel--an act which\r\nsurely balances the stories usually told of his love of money and thirst\r\nfor preferment.\r\n\r\nHis next work was, \"The Centaur not Fabulous, in Six Letters to a\r\nFriend.\" Its subjects were, the infidelity and licentiousness of that\r\nage. It is a pity that this book has fallen into oblivion, as it is a\r\nvery rich and powerful piece of writing. It is full of clear, sharp,\r\nsententious truth. Its style palpitates with energy, and glitters with\r\npoetic image. We wish we saw it reprinted in a cheap form; for, although\r\ninfidelity and pleasure have both materially changed their phases, there\r\nis much in Young's little work that has an imperishable application, and\r\nthat would be even yet eminently useful. The character of Altamont is\r\nsupposed to represent Lord Euston--a nobleman notorious for his vices.\r\nThe age in which Young's lot was cast was characterised by a low,\r\nsneering scepticism, and his earnest and awful letters were treated with\r\nridicule. Many pronounced him mad, others whispered about dotage. _Now_,\r\nthe book seems replete with wisdom, and burning almost with prophetic\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nYoung, in fact, was not generally appreciated during his lifetime. Tried\r\nby the Boileau and Pope standard, his writings were pronounced turgid,\r\nstrained, and extravagant. Even Warburton, who should have known better,\r\npassed a severe judgment on the \"Night Thoughts.\" He had, however, his\r\nwarm admirers, prominent among whom was the amiable and learned Joseph\r\nWarton. He dedicated to Young his \"Essay on Pope\"--an essay containing\r\nthe first sober and discriminating estimate of that most artificial of\r\ntrue poets, and with the opinions expressed in which Young is supposed to\r\nhave coincided; for, although he admired, and too often imitated, Pope's\r\nbrilliant point and antithesis, he was aware of far higher models, and\r\nfound Homer, Milton, and Job far more congenial companions in his\r\nstudious midnights. In 1758, he published a short and in nowise\r\nremarkable sermon, preached before the King at Kensington.\r\n\r\nRichardson, the novelist, was one of Young's greatest friends. Their\r\nviews on moral and religious subjects were identical; and in gravity of\r\ntone, and severity of genius, they resembled each other--Richardson being\r\na duller Young, and Young a more elastic and brilliant Richardson.\r\nAlthough both lived in a most depraved age, neither catered to its\r\ntastes. To Richardson, Young addressed, in 1759, a letter on Original\r\nComposition, which betrays no symptoms of senility, but is full of\r\nvigorous and striking remark. In 1762, when upwards of eighty, he wrote\r\nhis last and worst poem. It is entitled \"Resignation,\" and requires, on\r\nthe part of the reader, considerable exercise of that grace. It has very\r\nlittle of Young's peculiar power, and is chiefly filled with weak and\r\ntoothless abuse of his old acquaintance Voltaire. It was written, it\r\nappears, at the instance of Mrs Boscawen--the widow of the Admiral--who,\r\nhaving found consolation from the \"Night Thoughts,\" visited Young, and\r\nwas still more captivated by his conversation.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter years of his life, he is said to have fallen too much\r\nunder the dominion of his housekeeper, Mrs Hallowes, the widow of a\r\nclergyman, who is reported to have ruled him with a rod of iron. Ere his\r\ndeath he revised his printed works, and gave charges in his will that all\r\nhis MSS. should be burned. He applied, when past eighty, to Archbishop\r\nSecker for promotion, and was appointed Clerk of the Closet to the\r\nPrincess-Dowager of Wales. In April 1765, at the age of eighty-four, he\r\nbreathed his last. He had been previously unable to perform duty for\r\nthree or four years, but retained his faculties to the last. He left his\r\nproperty principally to his son, who was found by Johnson and Boswell, in\r\n1781, residing at Welwyn, and cherishing the memory of his father.\r\n\r\nYoung was unquestionably a neglected man. Out of all sight the greatest\r\ngenius then connected with the ministry of the Church of England, he\r\nnever mounted one step higher than the rectorship his own college had\r\nconferred on him. Many reasons have been assigned for this. Some say that\r\nit was because he had attached himself to the side of Frederick, Prince\r\nof Wales, and had preached an obnoxious sermon at St James's; others,\r\nthat it was because he had received a pension through Sir Robert Walpole.\r\nWe think that the real cause lay in the vulgar and senseless prejudice\r\nwhich prevailed then, and in some measure prevails still, against a\r\nliterary divine, as if he were a hybrid, or \"centaur, not fabulous.\" Let\r\nus not blame that age so long as we remember the burning shame reflected\r\non ours by the fact that the gifted and high-charactered author of\r\n_Salathiel_, and _Paris_ in 1815, is still only the rector of St\r\nStephen's, Walbrook, while many younger men, who in comparison with him\r\nare of little mark, have reached the episcopal bench. Probably Young felt\r\nhimself consoled for his bad success, by the knowledge that his name and\r\ngreat poem had travelled to foreign lands, and that Madame Klopstock was\r\nwondering--good, simple soul!--that her husband's idol and her own, had\r\nnot been made Archbishop of Canterbury.\r\n\r\nVery little beyond what we have mentioned has been left on record about\r\nhis private habits and manners. It was his custom, when well pleased with\r\na passage in the course of his reading, to double down the leaf--when\r\nparticularly gratified, to mark it by two folds; and some favourite\r\nworks, such as _The Rambler_, had so many of these marks of approbation\r\nthat they would not shut. On one occasion, in replying to Tonson and\r\nLintot, who were both candidates for printing one of his works, he\r\nmisdirected the letters; and when Lintot opened his, he found it\r\nbegun--\"Bernard Lintot is so great a scoundrel,\" &c. Young was proverbial\r\nfor absence of mind, and sometimes forgot whether he had dined or not.\r\nYet in Welwyn his mode of life was rather systematic. He rose early, made\r\nhis domestics join him in morning prayer, read little, ate and drank\r\nmoderately, walked much in his churchyard, and, in general, retired to\r\nrest punctually at eight evening. His son told Dr Johnson that he was\r\ncheerful in company, but gloomy when alone, and that he never fully\r\nrecovered his spirits after his wife's death. Mr Jones, his curate, has\r\nconfirmed this statement, although the gossipping and heartless tone of\r\nhis letters about such a man cannot be too strongly condemned. Young was\r\nsubject to fits of inspiration, which stupid people confounded with\r\nmadness. At times his poetry rushed upon him like a whirlwind, and caught\r\nhim up\r\n\r\n  \"Like swift Ezekiel, by his lock of hair\"--\r\n\r\nand when he came down he seemed weak, panting, and powerless. Mrs\r\nBoscawen and others describe his conversation as still more remarkable\r\nthan his writings, although occasionally disfigured by conceits and bad\r\npuns.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe come now to speak of his genius, especially as manifested in the\r\n\"Night Thoughts.\" The subject of this wonderful strain was one which, in\r\nits novelty, dignity, and depth, challenged the very highest exercise of\r\nthe very highest faculties; and had Young risen to the full height of his\r\ngreat argument, he had become the greatest of all poets. This we by no\r\nmeans affirm he did; but we do assert, that many of the aspects of his\r\nmagnificent theme have been fully and eloquently expressed by him, and\r\nthat some of his passages are unsurpassed in the language of men.\r\n\r\nThe poem demands a brief critical consideration as to its _season_, its\r\n_argument_, its _imagery_, its _style_, its _versification_, its\r\n_comparative place_ and _merit_, and, lastly, the _genius_ of its author.\r\nFirst, of its _season_--the Night--and the use to which he turns it.\r\nNight had never before found a worthy laureate. Its profound silence, as\r\nif it were listening to catch the accents of some supernal voice--the\r\nshadowy grandeur and mysterious newness it gives to objects on the\r\nearth--the divine hues into which its moon discolours all things--the\r\ndeep sleep which then falleth upon men, and changes the world into one\r\nhushed grave--the supernatural shapes and mystic sounds which have been\r\nsupposed to walk in its darkness, or to echo through its depths--the\r\nvoices scarce less solemn, which often break its silence, of howling\r\nwinds, and wailing rivers, and shrieking tempests, and groaning thunders,\r\nand the wild cries of human misery and despair--and last and highest, its\r\nwithdrawal of the bright mist and mantle of day from the starry universe,\r\nand the pomp with which it unrols and exhibits its \"great map\" of suns\r\nand systems--its silvery satellites--its meek planets, each shining in\r\nits own degree of reflected splendour--its oceans of original and\r\never-burning fire called suns--its comets, those serpents of the sky,\r\ntrailing their vast volumes of deadly glory through the shuddering\r\nsystem--its fantastic and magnificent shapes and collocations of stars,\r\nthe constellations--its firmaments rising above firmaments, like rounds\r\nin a ladder, at the top of which is the throne of God--and those two\r\nawful arms into which its Milky Way diverges, and which seem uplifted to\r\nheaven in silent prayer, or in some deep and dread protest,--all these\r\nelements of interest and grandeur had existed from the beginning of the\r\nworld in Night, and yet had never, till Young arose, awakened any\r\nconsecutive and lofty strain of poetic adoration. Many beautiful and many\r\nsublime sentiments had been uttered by poets about particular features of\r\nNight, but there had been no attempt to represent it as a whole. There\r\nwere many single thoughts, but no large and sounding Hymn. The views of\r\nthe Pagan poets about astronomy were, of course, warped by the absurd\r\nsystems of their day; and this served to damp their fire, and to render\r\ntheir poetic tributes rather fantastic than truly powerful. Even Dante\r\nand Milton are somewhat embarrassed by the Ptolemaic system, although it\r\nproves the strength of their genius that they have extracted so much\r\npoetry from it. But before Young arose,\r\n\r\n  \"Nature and nature's laws lay hid in night;\r\n  God said, Let Newton be, and all was light;\"\r\n\r\nand he has set the Newtonian system to his own martial music.\r\n\r\nWe are far from contending that Young has exhausted the poetry of the\r\ntheme. Since his time the telescopes of Herschell and Lord Rosse have\r\nbeen turned to the skies, and have greatly extended the size and\r\nsplendour of that vast midnight Apparition--the starry scheme. Our recent\r\npoets have availed themselves of these discoveries, as witness the\r\neloquent rhapsodies about the stars by Bailey, A. Smith, and Bigg. And\r\nthere is even yet room for another great poem on the subject, entitled\r\n\"Night,\" were the author come. But Young deserves praise for the\r\nfollowing things:--\r\n\r\n_1st_, He has nobly sung the magnitude and unutterable glory of the\r\nstarry hosts. His soul kindles, triumphs, exults under the midnight\r\ncanopy. As the Tartar horse when led forth from his stable to the free\r\nsteppes and free firmament of the desert, bounds, prances, and caracoles\r\nfor joy, so does Young, in the last part of his poem. Escaped from dark\r\nand mournful contemplations on Man, Death, Infidelity, and Earth's\r\n\"melancholy map,\" he sees the stars like bright milestones on the way to\r\nheaven, and his spirit is glad within him, and tumultuous is the\r\ngrandeur, and fierce and rapid the torrent, of his song.\r\n\r\n_2dly_, He has brought out, better than any other poet, the religion of\r\nthe stars. \"Night,\" says Isaac Taylor, \"has three daughters, Atheism,\r\nSuperstition, and Religion.\" Following out this fine thought, we see\r\nAtheism looking up with impudent eye, brazen brow, and naked figure, to\r\nthe midnight sky, as if it were only a huge toy-shop of glittering\r\ngew-gaws; Superstition shrouding herself in a black mantle, and falling\r\ndown prostrate and trembling before these innumerable fires, as if they\r\nwere the eyes of an infinite enemy; while Religion turns aloft her\r\nhumble, yet fearless form, her tear-trembling yet radiant visage, and\r\nmurmurs, \"My Father made them all.\" Young, we need scarcely say, finds in\r\nthe nocturnal heavens lessons neither of Atheism nor of Superstition, but\r\nof Religion, and reads in the face of Old Night her divine origin, the\r\nwitness she bears to the existence of God, her dependence upon her\r\nAuthor, and her subordination to His purposes. He had magnified, as\r\nNewton himself could not so eloquently have done, the extent of the\r\nuniverse; and yet his loyalty to Scripture compels him to intimate that\r\nthis system, so far from being God, or infinite, or, strictly speaking,\r\nDivine, is to perish and pass away. One look from the angry Judge, one\r\nuplifting of His rod, and its voluminous waves of glory, like another Red\r\nSea, are to be dried up, that the people of God may pass through and\r\nenter on the land of the real Immortality, the \"inheritance\r\nincorruptible, undefiled, and that shall never fade away.\" We refer our\r\nreaders to that most eloquent picture, near the beginning of the Ninth\r\nNight, of the Last Day. We once heard a lecturer on chemistry close a\r\nsuperb description of the material universe, with the words, \"And it is\r\nto shine on for ever.\" We thought of the words of Peter, \"All these\r\nthings shall be dissolved.\" And then we fancied an invisible animalcule\r\ninhabiting one of the mountain peaks of a furnace, looking abroad from\r\none of its surging spires, and saying, \"This wondrous blaze is to burn\r\nfor ever,\" and yet, ere a few hours have passed, the flame is sunk in\r\nashes, and the animalcule is gone. So the Heavens shall pass away with a\r\ngreat noise. They shall perish, but Thou God remainest; nay, thou Man,\r\ntoo, art destined to survive this splendid nursery, and to enter on new\r\nHeavens and a new Earth!\r\n\r\nThe argument of the \"Night Thoughts\" may be stated in general to be as\r\nfollows:--It is to shew the vanity of man as mortal; to inculcate the\r\nlowness, misery, and madness of the sensual life; to prove the\r\nsuperiority of the Christian to the man of the world, both in life and in\r\ndeath, and the worthlessness of merely human friendship; to argue, from\r\nnature and reason, the truth of man's immortality; to shew the\r\nreasonableness of religion, and to inculcate the necessity of a divine\r\nrevelation, and of a propitiatory sacrifice. That this argument is always\r\nsteadily pursued, or logically pled, we do not pretend. It has its\r\nflaws;--we particularly demur to many of its proofs of the immortality of\r\nthe soul, which seem to us very feeble and unsatisfactory; but, taking it\r\nas a whole, it is unanswerable and overwhelming. Its links are of red-hot\r\niron; its appeals to the conscience are irresistible; and he who can read\r\nit with indifference, or rise from it unimpressed and unawed, must be\r\neither something worse or something less than man. It needs not to be\r\nsurrounded by panegyrics. Convinced, purified, elevated, saved Souls, are\r\nthe gems in its crown. We are inclined to believe that, in this aspect,\r\nthe \"Night Thoughts\" has effected more practical good than the \"Paradise\r\nLost.\" The latter is a splendid picture; the former a searching, powerful\r\nsermon. Now, although pictures with a strong moral contained in them have\r\noften done much good, they want the point, emphasis, and effect of great\r\nsermons. You may gaze long enough at Milton with no feeling besides\r\nadmiration of his genius; but in every page Young is grappling with your\r\nconscience, and saying, \"Don't look at me, but look to yourself.\" Foster,\r\none of the greatest of our practical reasoners on religion, has been much\r\nindebted to Young, whom he resembled also in the sombre grandeur of his\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nYoung's imagery is distinguished by its richness, originality, and\r\nexceeding boldness. It was verily a new thing in that timid and\r\nconventional age. Like the imagery of all highest poets, it is selected\r\nalike from low and from lofty objects, from the gay and the gloomy, from\r\nstars and dunghills. His mind moves along through the poem like a great\r\nwheel, now descending and now ascending, easy to criticise, but\r\nimpossible to resist. You may question the taste of many of his figures,\r\nsuch as that of the Sun--\r\n\r\n  \"Rude drunkard, rising rosy from the main;\"\r\n\r\nor when he speaks of God as the \"Great Philanthropist;\" or calls the moon\r\n\"the Portland of the skies;\" but you always feel yourself in contact with\r\na new, native, overflowing mind--with a mind which has read nature\r\nthrough man, and man through nature. There is to Young's genius nothing\r\ncommon or unclean in the material universe. _All_ points up to God, and\r\nlooks round significantly to man. His imagination has no limits, and,\r\nwhen he is thoroughly roused, like the war-horse of Job, the \"glory of\r\nhis nostrils is terrible;\" it is the fury of power, the revel of\r\nconscious wealth, the \"prancing of a mighty one;\" not the dance of mere\r\nfancy, but the earnestness and energy of one treading a winepress alone.\r\nIn proof of this, we appeal to his splendid passages on the miserable\r\nstate of Man, on Dreams, on Procrastination, to one half of his defence\r\nof Immortality, and to the whole of his descant on the Stars. This every\r\none feels is power--barbarous power, if you will--savage, mismanaged\r\npower, if you please to call it so; but power that moves, agitates,\r\noverwhelms, hurries you away like an infant on the stream of a cataract.\r\n\r\nHis diction is, on the whole, a worthy medium to his thought. It has been\r\nsomewhat spoiled by intimacy with Pope's writings, and is often vitiated\r\nwith antithesis, an excess in which was the mode of the day. Now and\r\nthen, too, he is coarse and violent, to vulgarity, in his expressions.\r\nBut whenever he forgets Pope, and remembers Milton--or, still more, when\r\nhe becomes swallowed up in the magnitude of his theme--his language is\r\neasy, powerful, and magnificent. It never, as Mitford asserts, is\r\nunsupported by a \"corresponding grandeur of thought.\" There is more\r\nthought in Young's poem--more sharp, clear, original reflection--more of\r\nthat matter which leaves stings behind it--more moral sublimity--than in\r\nany poem which has appeared since in Britain. Mitford says, that \"every\r\nimage is amplified to the utmost.\" Some images unquestionably are; but\r\namplification is not a prevailing vice of Young's style--it is, indeed,\r\ninconsistent with that pointed intensity which is his general manner; and\r\nhow comes it, if he be a diffuse and wordy writer, that his pages\r\nliterally sparkle with maxims, and that, next perhaps to Shakspeare, no\r\npoet has been so often quoted? What the same writer means by Young\r\n\"fatiguing the reader's mind,\" we can understand; since it is fatiguing\r\nto look long at the sun, or to follow the grand parabola of the eagle's\r\nflight; but how he should \"dissatisfy\" the mind of any intelligent and\r\ncandid reader, is to us extraordinary. It is not true that the work has\r\n\"a uniformity of subject.\" Its tone is rather uniform, but its subjects\r\nare as varied as they are important. They are--Man--the World--Ambition--\r\nPleasure--Infidelity--Immortality--Death--Judgment--Heaven--Hell--the\r\nStars--Eternity. Mr Mitford compares Young to Seneca; as if a cold\r\ncollector of stiff maxims, and a poet whose wisdom was set in enthusiasm\r\nas in a ring of fire, were proper subjects of comparison. And it is\r\nstrange how he should introduce the name of Cicero, as if he were not\r\nthat very master of amplification, and of over-copiousness of expression,\r\nwhich Mitford _imagines_ Young to be! \"No selection--no discreet and\r\ngraceful reservation--no experienced taste!\"--in other words, he was not\r\nPope or Campbell, but Edward Young--not a middle-sized, neat, and\r\nwell-dressed citizen, but a hirsute giant--not an elegant _parterre_, but\r\nan American forest, bowing only to the old Tempests, and offering up a\r\nholocaust of native wealth and glory, not to Man, but to God.\r\n\r\nHis versification is a more vulnerable point. We grant at once that it\r\nis, as a whole, rugged and imperfect, and that, while his single lines\r\nare often exceedingly melodious, he rarely reaches, any more than Pope or\r\nJohnson, those long and linked swells of sound--\r\n\r\n  \"Floating, mingling, interweaving,\r\n  Rising, sinking, and receiving\r\n  Each from each, while each is giving\r\n  On to each, and each relieving\r\n  Each, the pails of gold, the living\r\n  Current through the air is heaving\"--\r\n\r\nwhich Goethe has so beautifully, although unintentionally, described in\r\nthese words, applied by him to the elements of Nature; and which he and\r\nMilton, and Spenser, and Coleridge, and Shelley, have so admirably\r\nexemplified in their verse. Young's style is too broken and sententious\r\nto permit the miracles of melody which are found in some of our poets.\r\nYet he has a few passages which approach even to this high standard. Take\r\nthe following:--\r\n\r\n  \"Look nature through, 'tis revolution all;\r\n  All change, no death. Day follows night, and night\r\n  The dying day; stars rise and set and rise;\r\n  Earth takes th' example. See the summer gay,\r\n  With her green chaplet, and ambrosial flowers,\r\n  Droops into pallid autumn; winter gray,\r\n  Horrid with frost, and turbulent with storm,\r\n  Blows autumn, and his golden fruits away;\r\n  Then melts into the spring. Soft spring, with breath\r\n  Favonian, from warm chambers of the south,\r\n  Recalls the first.\"\r\n\r\nOr take the well-known burst which closes the First Night:--\r\n\r\n  \"The sprightly lark's shrill matin wakes the morn;\r\n  Grief's sharpest thorn hard pressing on my breast,\r\n  I strive, with wakeful melody, to cheer\r\n  The sullen gloom, sweet Philomel! like thee,\r\n  And call the stars to listen: every star\r\n  Is deaf to mine, enamour'd of thy lay.\r\n  Yet be not vain; there are, who thine excel,\r\n  And charm through distant ages: wrapt in shade,\r\n  Prisoner of darkness! to the silent hours\r\n  How often I repeat their rage divine,\r\n  To lull my griefs, and steal my heart from woe!\r\n  I roll their raptures, but not catch their fire,\r\n  Dark, though not blind, like thee, Maeonides!\r\n  Or his, who made Maeonides our own.\r\n  Man, too, he sung; immortal man I sing;\r\n  Oft bursts my song beyond the bounds of life;\r\n  What, now, but immortality, can please?\r\n  O had he press'd his theme, pursued the track\r\n  Which opens out of darkness into day!\r\n  O had he, mounted on his wing of fire,\r\n  Soar'd where I sink, and sung immortal man!\r\n  How had it bless'd mankind, and rescued me!\"\r\n\r\nThe reader will notice how, in this noble passage, the individual\r\nsentences and points are all subordinated to the main purpose of the\r\npoet, and being subjected to the general stress of the strain, do not\r\ndetract from, but add to, its musical unity.\r\n\r\nThe comparative place of the poem, and the genius of the writer, are two\r\nsubjects which are closely connected, and indeed slide into each other.\r\nThe \"Night Thoughts\" must not be named, in interest, finish, sustained\r\nsublimity, and artistic completeness, with the \"Iliad,\" the \"Divina\r\nCommedia,\" or the \"Paradise Lost.\" It ranks, however, at the top of such\r\na high class of poems as Cowper's Poems, Thomson's \"Seasons,\" Byron's\r\nPoems, Blair's \"Grave,\" Pollock's \"Course of Time,\" and a few others not\r\nvery often criticised now-a-days. Young, however, seems to us to have\r\nbeen capable of even higher things than he has effected in his works. He\r\nwas one of those prolific, fiery, inexhaustible souls, who never seem\r\nnearing a limit, or dreaming of a shallow in their genius; who, often\r\nstumbling over precipices or precipitated into pools, rise stronger, and\r\nrush on faster, from their misadventures; who, sometimes stopping too\r\nlong to moralise on fungi and ant-hillocks, are all the better breathed\r\nto career through endless forests, and to take Alps and Andes at a flying\r\nleap; and who are\r\n\r\n  \"Ne'er so sure our pleasure to create,\r\n  As when they tread the brink of all we hate.\"\r\n\r\nHis taste was not equal certainly to his other faculties, and he was\r\nguilty of occasional extravagances, and stumbled not unfrequently over\r\nthe brink of the bathos; but his genius possessed the following\r\nqualities:--It was original. He had read much, but he copies little, and\r\nnever slavishly. His mind looks at everything--at skulls and\r\nstars--through a medium of its own. It was subtle as well as native and\r\nstrong, and in its movements it is broadly based on a vigorous intellect.\r\nIt was progressive and prophetic in its spirit, and many of our recent\r\nspeculations or semi-speculations on the relations of man and nature, are\r\nto be found in Young--ay, in the mere spray his mind threw off on its way\r\nto an ulterior result. Think of this, for instance, and then remember a\r\nsimilar expression in Carlyle:--\r\n\r\n      \"Man's grief is but his grandeur in disguise;\r\n  And discontent is immortality.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, his genius, with all its compass and daring, was reverent and\r\nreligious. He gloried in the universe; he swam, as it were, and circled\r\nlike a strong swimmer, in that starry sea; but he bent before the Cross,\r\nand, instead of looking up, looked down, and cried out, \"God be merciful\r\nto me a sinner.\"\r\n\r\nWe commend his masterpiece to readers, partly, indeed, for its power,--a\r\npower that has hitherto rather been felt than acknowledged, rather\r\nadmired in silence than analysed; but principally because, like \"The\r\nTemple\" of Herbert, it is holy ground. The author, amid his elaborate\r\ningenuities, and wilful though minor perversities, never ceases to love\r\nand to honour truth; in pursuit of renown, he is never afraid to glory in\r\nthe Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ; and if his flights of fancy be at\r\ntimes too wild, and if his thoughts be often set to the tune of the\r\ntempest, it is a tempest on whose wings, to use his own simple but\r\nimmortal words, \"The Lord is abroad.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE COMPLAINT:\r\n                                  OR,\r\n                            NIGHT THOUGHTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the occasion of this Poem was real, not fictitious; so the method\r\npursued in it was rather imposed by what spontaneously arose in the\r\nAuthor's mind on that occasion, than meditated or designed. Which will\r\nappear very probable from the nature of it. For it differs from the\r\ncommon mode of poetry, which is, from long narrations to draw short\r\nmorals. Here, on the contrary, the narrative is short, and the morality\r\narising from it makes the bulk of the Poem. The reason of it is, that the\r\nfacts mentioned did naturally pour these moral reflections on the thought\r\nof the Writer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              NIGHT FIRST.\r\n\r\n                    ON LIFE, DEATH, AND IMMORTALITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE\r\n                          ARTHUR ONSLOW, ESQ.,\r\n                    SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.\r\n\r\n  Tired Nature's sweet restorer, balmy Sleep!\r\n  He, like the world, his ready visit pays\r\n  Where Fortune smiles; the wretched he forsakes;\r\n  Swift on his downy pinion flies from woe,\r\n  And lights on lids unsullied with a tear.\r\n    From short (as usual) and disturb'd repose,\r\n  I wake: how happy they, who wake no more!\r\n  Yet that were vain, if dreams infest the grave.\r\n  I wake, emerging from a sea of dreams\r\n  Tumultuous; where my wreck'd desponding thought                     10\r\n  From wave to wave of fancied misery\r\n  At random drove, her helm of reason lost.\r\n  Though now restored, 'tis only change of pain,\r\n  (A bitter change!) severer for severe:\r\n  The day too short for my distress; and night,                       15\r\n  Even in the zenith of her dark domain,\r\n  Is sunshine to the colour of my fate.\r\n    Night, sable goddess! from her ebon throne,\r\n  In rayless majesty, now stretches forth\r\n  Her leaden sceptre o'er a slumbering world.\r\n  Silence, how dead! and darkness, how profound!\r\n  Nor eye, nor listening ear, an object finds;\r\n  Creation sleeps. 'Tis as the general pulse                          23\r\n  Of life stood still, and nature made a pause;\r\n  An awful pause! prophetic of her end.\r\n  And let her prophecy be soon fulfill'd;\r\n  Fate! drop the curtain; I can lose no more.\r\n    Silence and darkness: solemn sisters! twins\r\n  From ancient Night, who nurse the tender thought\r\n  To reason, and on reason build resolve                              30\r\n  (That column of true majesty in man),\r\n  Assist me: I will thank you in the grave;\r\n  The grave, your kingdom: there this frame shall fall\r\n  A victim sacred to your dreary shrine.\r\n  But what are ye?--\r\n    Thou, who didst put to flight\r\n  Primeval Silence, when the morning stars,\r\n  Exulting, shouted o'er the rising ball;\r\n  O Thou, whose word from solid darkness struck\r\n  That spark, the sun; strike wisdom from my soul;                    40\r\n  My soul, which flies to thee, her trust, her treasure,\r\n  As misers to their gold, while others rest.\r\n  Through this opaque of nature, and of soul,\r\n  This double night, transmit one pitying ray,\r\n  To lighten, and to cheer. O lead my mind,\r\n  (A mind that fain would wander from its woe),\r\n  Lead it through various scenes of life and death;\r\n  And from each scene the noblest truths inspire.\r\n  Nor less inspire my conduct, than my song;                          49\r\n  Teach my best reason, reason; my best will\r\n  Teach rectitude; and fix my firm resolve\r\n  Wisdom to wed, and pay her long arrear:\r\n  Nor let the phial of thy vengeance, pour'd\r\n  On this devoted head, be pour'd in vain.\r\n    The bell strikes one. We take no note of time\r\n  But from its loss. To give it then a tongue\r\n  Is wise in man. As if an angel spoke,\r\n  I feel the solemn sound. If heard aright,\r\n  It is the knell of my departed hours:\r\n  Where are they? With the years beyond the flood.                    60\r\n  It is the signal that demands despatch:\r\n  How much is to be done? My hopes and fears\r\n  Start up alarm'd, and o'er life's narrow verge\r\n  Look down--on what? a fathomless abyss;\r\n  A dread eternity! how surely mine!\r\n  And can eternity belong to me,\r\n  Poor pensioner on the bounties of an hour?\r\n    How poor, how rich, how abject, how august,\r\n  How complicate, how wonderful, is man!\r\n  How passing wonder He who made him such!                            70\r\n  Who centred in our make such strange extremes!\r\n  From different natures marvellously mix'd,\r\n  Connexion exquisite of distant worlds!\r\n  Distinguish'd link in being's endless chain!\r\n  Midway from nothing to the Deity!\r\n  A beam ethereal, sullied and absorb'd!\r\n  Though sullied and dishonour'd, still divine!\r\n  Dim miniature of greatness absolute!\r\n  An heir of glory! a frail child of dust!\r\n  Helpless immortal! insect infinite!                                 80\r\n  A worm! a god!--I tremble at myself,\r\n  And in myself am lost! At home a stranger,\r\n  Thought wanders up and down, surprised, aghast,                     83\r\n  And wondering at her own: how reason reels!\r\n  O what a miracle to man is man,\r\n  Triumphantly distress'd! what joy, what dread!\r\n  Alternately transported and alarm'd!\r\n  What can preserve my life, or what destroy?\r\n  An angel's arm can't snatch me from the grave;\r\n  Legions of angels can't confine me there.                           90\r\n    'Tis past conjecture; all things rise in proof:\r\n  While o'er my limbs sleep's soft dominion spread,\r\n  What though my soul fantastic measures trod\r\n  O'er fairy fields; or mourn'd along the gloom\r\n  Of pathless woods; or down the craggy steep\r\n  Hurl'd headlong, swam with pain the mantled pool;\r\n  Or scaled the cliff; or danced on hollow winds,\r\n  With antic shapes, wild natives of the brain?\r\n  Her ceaseless flight, though devious, speaks her nature\r\n  Of subtler essence than the trodden clod;                          100\r\n  Active, aerial, towering, unconfined,\r\n  Unfetter'd with her gross companion's fall.\r\n  Even silent night proclaims my soul immortal:\r\n  Even silent night proclaims eternal day.\r\n  For human weal, Heaven husbands all events;\r\n  Dull sleep instructs, nor sport vain dreams in vain.\r\n    Why then their loss deplore that are not lost?\r\n  Why wanders wretched thought their tombs around,\r\n  In infidel distress? Are angels there?\r\n  Slumbers, raked up in dust, ethereal fire?                         110\r\n    They live! they greatly live a life on earth\r\n  Unkindled, unconceived; and from an eye\r\n  Of tenderness let heavenly pity fall\r\n  On me, more justly number'd with the dead.\r\n  This is the desert, this the solitude:\r\n  How populous, how vital, is the grave!\r\n  This is creation's melancholy vault,                               117\r\n  The vale funereal, the sad cypress gloom;\r\n  The land of apparitions, empty shades!\r\n  All, all on earth, is shadow, all beyond\r\n  Is substance; the reverse is Folly's creed:\r\n  How solid all, where change shall be no more!\r\n    This is the bud of being, the dim dawn,                          123\r\n  The twilight of our day, the vestibule;\r\n  Life's theatre as yet is shut, and death,\r\n  Strong death, alone can heave the massy bar,\r\n  This gross impediment of clay remove,\r\n  And make us embryos of existence free.\r\n  From real life, but little more remote\r\n  Is he, not yet a candidate for light,                              130\r\n  The future embryo, slumbering in his sire.\r\n  Embryos we must be, till we burst the shell,\r\n  Yon ambient azure shell, and spring to life,\r\n  The life of gods, O transport! and of man.\r\n    Yet man, fool man! here buries all his thoughts;\r\n  Inters celestial hopes without one sigh.\r\n  Prisoner of earth, and pent beneath the moon,\r\n  Here pinions all his wishes; wing'd by heaven\r\n  To fly at infinite; and reach it there,\r\n  Where seraphs gather immortality,                                  140\r\n  On life's fair tree, fast by the throne of God.\r\n  What golden joys ambrosial clustering glow\r\n  In His full beam, and ripen for the just,\r\n  Where momentary ages are no more!\r\n  Where time, and pain, and chance, and death, expire!\r\n  And is it in the flight of threescore years\r\n  To push eternity from human thought,\r\n  And smother souls immortal in the dust?\r\n  A soul immortal, spending all her fires,\r\n  Wasting her strength in strenuous idleness                         150\r\n  Thrown into tumult, raptured, or alarm'd,                          151\r\n  At aught this scene can threaten or indulge,\r\n  Resembles ocean into tempest wrought,\r\n  To waft a feather, or to drown a fly.\r\n    Where falls this censure? It o'erwhelms myself;\r\n  How was my heart encrusted by the world!\r\n  O how self-fetter'd was my grovelling soul!\r\n  How, like a worm, was I wrapt round and round\r\n  In silken thought, which reptile fancy spun,\r\n  Till darken'd reason lay quite clouded o'er                        160\r\n  With soft conceit of endless comfort here,\r\n  Nor yet put forth her wings to reach the skies!\r\n    Night-visions may befriend (as sung above):\r\n  Our waking dreams are fatal. How I dream'd\r\n  Of things impossible! (could sleep do more?)\r\n  Of joys perpetual in perpetual change!\r\n  Of stable pleasures on the tossing wave!\r\n  Eternal sunshine in the storms of life!\r\n  How richly were my noontide trances hung\r\n  With gorgeous tapestries of pictured joys!                         170\r\n  Joy behind joy, in endless perspective!\r\n  Till at death's toll, whose restless iron tongue\r\n  Calls daily for his millions at a meal,\r\n  Starting I woke, and found myself undone.\r\n  Where now my phrensy's pompous furniture?\r\n  The cobwebb'd cottage, with its ragged wall\r\n  Of mouldering mud, is royalty to me!\r\n  The spider's most attenuated thread\r\n  Is cord, is cable, to man's tender tie\r\n  On earthly bliss; it breaks at every breeze.                       180\r\n    O ye blest scenes of permanent delight!\r\n  Full above measure! lasting beyond bound!\r\n  A perpetuity of bliss is bliss.\r\n  Could you, so rich in rapture, fear an end,\r\n  That ghastly thought would drink up all your joy,                  185\r\n  And quite unparadise the realms of light.\r\n  Safe are you lodged above these rolling spheres;\r\n  The baleful influence of whose giddy dance\r\n  Sheds sad vicissitude on all beneath.\r\n  Here teems with revolutions every hour;\r\n  And rarely for the better; or the best,\r\n  More mortal than the common births of fate.\r\n  Each moment has its sickle, emulous                                193\r\n  Of Time's enormous scythe, whose ample sweep\r\n  Strikes empires from the root; each moment plays\r\n  His little weapon in the narrower sphere\r\n  Of sweet domestic comfort, and cuts down\r\n  The fairest bloom of sublunary bliss.\r\n    Bliss! sublunary bliss!--proud words, and vain!\r\n  Implicit treason to divine decree!                                 200\r\n  A bold invasion of the rights of Heaven!\r\n  I clasp'd the phantoms, and I found them air.\r\n  Oh! had I weigh'd it ere my fond embrace,\r\n  What darts of agony had miss'd my heart!\r\n    Death! great proprietor of all! 'tis thine\r\n  To tread out empire, and to quench the stars.\r\n  The sun himself by thy permission shines;\r\n  And, one day, thou shalt pluck him from his sphere.\r\n  Amid such mighty plunder, why exhaust\r\n  Thy partial quiver on a mark so mean?                              210\r\n  Why thy peculiar rancour wreak'd on me?\r\n  Insatiate archer! could not one suffice?\r\n  Thy shaft flew thrice;[2] and thrice my peace was slain;\r\n  And thrice, ere thrice yon moon had fill'd her horn.\r\n  O Cynthia! why so pale? dost thou lament\r\n  Thy wretched neighbour? grieve to see thy wheel\r\n  Of ceaseless change outwhirl'd in human life?                      217\r\n  How wanes my borrow'd bliss! from fortune's smile,\r\n  Precarious courtesy! not virtue's sure,\r\n  Self-given, solar ray of sound delight.\r\n    In every varied posture, place, and hour,\r\n  How widow'd every thought of every joy!\r\n  Thought, busy thought! too busy for my peace!\r\n  Through the dark postern of time long lapsed,                      224\r\n  Led softly, by the stillness of the night,\r\n  Led, like a murderer, (and such it proves!)\r\n  Strays (wretched rover!) o'er the pleasing past;\r\n  In quest of wretchedness perversely strays;\r\n  And finds all desert now; and meets the ghosts\r\n  Of my departed joys; a numerous train!                             230\r\n  I rue the riches of my former fate;\r\n  Sweet comfort's blasted clusters I lament;\r\n  I tremble at the blessings once so dear;\r\n  And every pleasure pains me to the heart.\r\n    Yet why complain? or why complain for one?\r\n  Hangs out the sun his lustre but for me,\r\n  The single man? Are angels all beside?\r\n  I mourn for millions: 'tis the common lot;\r\n  In this shape, or in that, has fate entail'd\r\n  The mother's throes on all of woman born,                          240\r\n  Not more the children, than sure heirs, of pain.\r\n    War, famine, pest, volcano, storm, and fire,\r\n  Intestine broils, oppression, with her heart\r\n  Wrapt up in triple brass, besiege mankind.\r\n  God's image disinherited of day,\r\n  Here, plunged in mines, forgets a sun was made.\r\n  There, beings deathless as their haughty lord,\r\n  Are hammer'd to the galling oar for life;\r\n  And plough the winter's wave, and reap despair.\r\n  Some, for hard masters, broken under arms,                         250\r\n  In battle lopp'd away, with half their limbs,                      251\r\n  Beg bitter bread through realms their valour saved,\r\n  If so the tyrant, or his minion, doom.\r\n  Want and incurable disease (fell pair!)\r\n  On hopeless multitudes remorseless seize\r\n  At once; and make a refuge of the grave.\r\n  How groaning hospitals eject their dead!\r\n  What numbers groan for sad admission there!\r\n  What numbers, once in fortune's lap high-fed,\r\n  Solicit the cold hand of charity!                                  260\r\n  To shock us more, solicit it in vain!\r\n  Ye silken sons of pleasure! since in pains\r\n  Ye rue more modish visits, visit here,\r\n  And breathe from your debauch: give, and reduce\r\n  Surfeit's dominion o'er you: but so great\r\n  Your impudence, you blush at what is right.\r\n  Happy, did sorrow seize on such alone!\r\n  Not prudence can defend, or virtue save;\r\n  Disease invades the chastest temperance;\r\n  And punishment the guiltless; and alarm,                           270\r\n  Through thickest shades pursues the fond of peace.\r\n  Man's caution often into danger turns,\r\n  And his guard falling, crushes him to death.\r\n  Not happiness itself makes good her name!\r\n  Our very wishes give us not our wish.\r\n  How distant oft the thing we doat on most,\r\n  From that for which we doat, felicity!\r\n  The smoothest course of nature has its pains;\r\n  And truest friends, through error, wound our rest.\r\n  Without misfortune, what calamities!                               280\r\n  And what hostilities, without a foe!\r\n  Nor are foes wanting to the best on earth.\r\n  But endless is the list of human ills,\r\n  And sighs might sooner fail, than cause to sigh.\r\n    A part how small of the terraqueous globe                        285\r\n  Is tenanted by man! the rest a waste,\r\n  Rocks, deserts, frozen seas, and burning sands:\r\n  Wild haunts of monsters, poisons, stings, and death.\r\n  Such is earth's melancholy map! But, far\r\n  More sad! this earth is a true map of man.\r\n  So bounded are its haughty lord's delights\r\n  To woe's wide empire; where deep troubles toss,\r\n  Loud sorrows howl, envenom'd passions bite,                        293\r\n  Ravenous calamities our vitals seize,\r\n  And threatening fate wide opens to devour.\r\n    What then am I, who sorrow for myself?\r\n  In age, in infancy, from others' aid\r\n  Is all our hope; to teach us to be kind.\r\n  That, nature's first, last lesson to mankind;\r\n  The selfish heart deserves the pain it feels;                      300\r\n  More generous sorrow, while it sinks, exalts;\r\n  And conscious virtue mitigates the pang.\r\n  Nor virtue, more than prudence, bids me give\r\n  Swoln thought a second channel; who divide,\r\n  They weaken, too, the torrent of their grief.\r\n  Take then, O world! thy much-indebted tear:\r\n  How sad a sight is human happiness,\r\n  To those whose thought can pierce beyond an hour!\r\n  O thou! whate'er thou art, whose heart exults!\r\n  Would'st thou I should congratulate thy fate?                      310\r\n  I know thou would'st; thy pride demands it from me.\r\n  Let thy pride pardon, what thy nature needs,\r\n  The salutary censure of a friend.\r\n  Thou happy wretch! by blindness thou art blest;\r\n  By dotage dandled to perpetual smiles.\r\n  Know, smiler! at thy peril art thou pleased;\r\n  Thy pleasure is the promise of thy pain.\r\n  Misfortune, like a creditor severe,\r\n  But rises in demand for her delay;                                 319\r\n  She makes a scourge of past prosperity,\r\n  To sting thee more, and double thy distress.\r\n    Lorenzo, Fortune makes her court to thee,\r\n  Thy fond heart dances, while the syren sings.\r\n  Dear is thy welfare; think me not unkind;\r\n  I would not damp, but to secure thy joys.\r\n  Think not that fear is sacred to the storm:\r\n  Stand on thy guard against the smiles of fate.\r\n  Is Heaven tremendous in its frowns? Most sure;\r\n  And in its favours formidable too:\r\n  Its favours here are trials, not rewards;                          330\r\n  A call to duty, not discharge from care;\r\n  And should alarm us, full as much as woes;\r\n  Awake us to their cause, and consequence;\r\n  O'er our scann'd conduct give a jealous eye,\r\n  And make us tremble, weigh'd with our desert;\r\n  Awe nature's tumult, and chastise her joys,\r\n  Lest, while we clasp, we kill them; nay, invert\r\n  To worse than simple misery, their charms.\r\n  Revolted joys, like foes in civil war,\r\n  Like bosom friendships to resentment sour'd,                       340\r\n  With rage envenom'd rise against our peace.\r\n  Beware what earth calls happiness; beware\r\n  All joys, but joys that never can expire.\r\n  Who builds on less than an immortal base,\r\n  Fond as he seems, condemns his joys to death.\r\n    Mine died with thee, Philander![3] thy last sigh\r\n  Dissolved the charm; the disenchanted earth\r\n  Lost all her lustre. Where her glittering towers?\r\n  Her golden mountains, where? all darken'd down\r\n  To naked waste; a dreary vale of tears:                            350\r\n  The great magician's dead! Thou poor, pale piece\r\n  Of outcast earth, in darkness! what a change                       352\r\n  From yesterday! Thy darling hope so near\r\n  (Long-labour'd prize!), O how ambition flush'd\r\n  Thy glowing cheek! ambition truly great,\r\n  Of virtuous praise. Death's subtle seed within\r\n  (Sly, treacherous miner!), working in the dark,\r\n  Smiled at thy well-concerted scheme, and beckon'd\r\n  The worm to riot on that rose so red,\r\n  Unfaded ere it fell; one moment's prey!                            360\r\n    Man's foresight is conditionally wise;\r\n  Lorenzo![4] wisdom into folly turns\r\n  Oft, the first instant, its idea fair\r\n  To labouring thought is born. How dim our eye!\r\n  The present moment terminates our sight;\r\n  Clouds thick as those on doomsday, drown the next;\r\n  We penetrate, we prophesy in vain.\r\n  Time is dealt out by particles; and each,\r\n  Ere mingled with the streaming sands of life,\r\n  By fate's inviolable oath is sworn                                 370\r\n  Deep silence, \"where eternity begins.\"\r\n    By nature's law, what may be, may be now;\r\n  There's no prerogative in human hours.\r\n  In human hearts what bolder thought can rise,\r\n  Than man's presumption on to-morrow's dawn!\r\n  Where is to-morrow? In another world.\r\n  For numbers this is certain; the reverse\r\n  Is sure to none; and yet on this perhaps,\r\n  This peradventure, infamous for lies,\r\n  As on a rock of adamant, we build                                  380\r\n  Our mountain hopes; spin out eternal schemes,\r\n  As we the fatal sisters could out-spin,\r\n  And, big with life's futurities, expire.\r\n    Not even Philander had bespoke his shroud;\r\n  Nor had he cause; a warning was denied.                            385\r\n  How many fall as sudden, not as safe!\r\n  As sudden, though for years admonish'd home.\r\n  Of human ills the last extreme beware,\r\n  Beware, Lorenzo! a slow sudden death.\r\n  How dreadful that deliberate surprise!\r\n  Be wise to-day; 'tis madness to defer;\r\n  Next day the fatal precedent will plead;                           392\r\n  Thus on, till wisdom is push'd out of life.\r\n  Procrastination is the thief of time;\r\n  Year after year it steals, till all are fled,\r\n  And to the mercies of a moment leaves\r\n  The vast concerns of an eternal scene.\r\n  If not so frequent, would not this be strange?\r\n  That 'tis so frequent, this is stranger still.\r\n    Of man's miraculous mistakes, this bears                         400\r\n  The palm, \"That all men are about to live,\"\r\n  For ever on the brink of being born.\r\n  All pay themselves the compliment to think\r\n  They one day shall not drivel: and their pride\r\n  On this reversion takes up ready praise;\r\n  At least, their own; their future selves applaud;\r\n  How excellent that life they ne'er will lead!\r\n  Time lodged in their own hands is folly's vails;[5]\r\n  That lodged in fate's, to wisdom they consign;\r\n  The thing they can't but purpose, they postpone;                   410\r\n  'Tis not in folly, not to scorn a fool;\r\n  And scarce in human wisdom to do more.\r\n  All promise is poor dilatory man,\r\n  And that through every stage: when young, indeed,\r\n  In full content we, sometimes, nobly rest,\r\n  Unanxious for ourselves; and only wish,\r\n  As duteous sons, our fathers were more wise.\r\n  At thirty, man suspects himself a fool;\r\n  Knows it at forty, and reforms his plan;                           419\r\n  At fifty, chides his infamous delay,\r\n  Pushes his prudent purpose to resolve;\r\n  In all the magnanimity of thought\r\n  Resolves; and re-resolves; then dies the same.\r\n    And why? Because he thinks himself immortal.\r\n  All men think all men mortal, but themselves:\r\n  Themselves, when some alarming shock of fate\r\n  Strikes through their wounded hearts the sudden dread;\r\n  But their hearts wounded, like the wounded air,\r\n  Soon close; where pass'd the shaft, no trace is found.\r\n  As from the wing no scar the sky retains;                          430\r\n  The parted wave no furrow from the keel;\r\n  So dies in human hearts the thought of death.\r\n  Even with the tender tear which nature sheds\r\n  O'er those we love, we drop it in their grave.\r\n  Can I forget Philander? That were strange!\r\n  O my full heart!----But should I give it vent,\r\n  The longest night, though longer far, would fail,\r\n  And the lark listen to my midnight song.\r\n    The sprightly lark's shrill matin wakes the morn;\r\n  Grief's sharpest thorn hard pressing on my breast,                 440\r\n  I strive, with wakeful melody, to cheer\r\n  The sullen gloom, sweet Philomel! like thee,\r\n  And call the stars to listen: every star\r\n  Is deaf to mine, enamour'd of thy lay.\r\n  Yet be not vain; there are, who thine excel,\r\n  And charm through distant ages: wrapt in shade,\r\n  Prisoner of darkness! to the silent hours,\r\n  How often I repeat their rage divine,\r\n  To lull my griefs, and steal my heart from woe!\r\n  I roll their raptures, but not catch their fire.                   450\r\n  Dark, though not blind, like thee, Maeonides![6]\r\n  Or, Milton! thee; ah, could I reach your strain!                   452\r\n  Or his, who made Maeonides our own.[7]\r\n  Man too he sung: immortal man I sing;\r\n  Oft bursts my song beyond the bounds of life;\r\n  What, now, but immortality, can please?\r\n  O had he press'd his theme, pursued the track,\r\n  Which opens out of darkness into day!\r\n  O had he, mounted on his wing of fire,\r\n  Soar'd where I sink, and sung immortal man!                        460\r\n  How had it bless'd mankind, and rescued me!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   ON\r\n                      TIME, DEATH, AND FRIENDSHIP.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE\r\n                        THE EARL OF WILMINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             NIGHT SECOND.\r\n\r\n                    ON TIME, DEATH, AND FRIENDSHIP.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"When the cock crew, he wept\"--smote by that eye\r\n  Which looks on me, on all: that Power, who bids\r\n  This midnight sentinel, with clarion shrill\r\n  (Emblem of that which shall awake the dead),\r\n  Rouse souls from slumber, into thoughts of heaven.\r\n  Shall I too weep? Where then is fortitude?\r\n  And, fortitude abandon'd, where is man?\r\n  I know the terms on which he sees the light;\r\n  He that is born, is listed; life is war;\r\n  Eternal war with woe. Who bears it best,                            10\r\n  Deserves it least.--On other themes I'll dwell.\r\n  Lorenzo! let me turn my thoughts on thee,\r\n  And thine, on themes may profit; profit there,\r\n  Where most thy need; themes, too, the genuine growth\r\n  Of dear Philander's dust. He thus, though dead,\r\n  May still befriend--what themes? Time's wondrous price,\r\n  Death, friendship, and Philander's final scene.\r\n  So could I touch these themes, as might obtain\r\n  Thine ear, nor leave thy heart quite disengaged,\r\n  The good deed would delight me; half impress                        20\r\n  On my dark cloud an Iris; and from grief\r\n  Call glory.--Dost thou mourn Philander's fate?\r\n  I know thou say'st it: says thy life the same?\r\n  He mourns the dead, who lives as they desire.\r\n  Where is that thrift, that avarice of time,\r\n  (O glorious avarice!) thought of death inspires,\r\n  As rumour'd robberies endear our gold?\r\n  O time! than gold more sacred; more a load\r\n  Than lead to fools; and fools reputed wise.\r\n  What moment granted man without account?                            30\r\n  What years are squander'd, wisdom's debt unpaid!\r\n  Our wealth in days, all due to that discharge.\r\n  Haste, haste, he lies in wait, he's at the door,\r\n  Insidious Death! should his strong hand arrest,\r\n  No composition sets the prisoner free.\r\n  Eternity's inexorable chain\r\n  Fast binds; and vengeance claims the full arrear.\r\n    How late I shudder'd on the brink! how late\r\n  Life call'd for her last refuge in despair!\r\n  That time is mine, O Mead! to thee I owe;                           40\r\n  Fain would I pay thee with eternity.\r\n  But ill my genius answers my desire;\r\n  My sickly song is mortal, past thy cure.\r\n  Accept the will;--that dies not with my strain.\r\n    For what calls thy disease, Lorenzo? not\r\n  For Esculapian, but for moral aid.\r\n  Thou think'st it folly to be wise too soon.\r\n  Youth is not rich in time, it may be poor;\r\n  Part with it as with money, sparing; pay\r\n  No moment, but in purchase of its worth;                            50\r\n  And what its worth, ask death-beds; they can tell.\r\n  Part with it as with life, reluctant; big\r\n  With holy hope of nobler time to come;\r\n  Time higher aim'd, still nearer the great mark                      54\r\n  Of men and angels; virtue more divine.\r\n    Is this our duty, wisdom, glory, gain?\r\n  (These Heaven benign in vital union binds)\r\n  And sport we like the natives of the bough,\r\n  When vernal suns inspire? Amusement reigns\r\n  Man's great demand: to trifle, is to live:\r\n  And is it then a trifle, too, to die?\r\n    Thou say'st I preach, Lorenzo! 'tis confess'd.                    62\r\n  What, if for once, I preach thee quite awake?\r\n  Who wants amusement in the flame of battle?\r\n  Is it not treason to the soul immortal,\r\n  Her foes in arms, eternity the prize?\r\n  Will toys amuse, when medicines cannot cure?\r\n  When spirits ebb, when life's enchanting scenes\r\n  Their lustre lose, and lessen in our sight,\r\n  As lands, and cities with their glittering spires,                  70\r\n  To the poor shatter'd bark, by sudden storm\r\n  Thrown off to sea, and soon to perish there?\r\n  Will toys amuse? No: thrones will then be toys,\r\n  And earth and skies seem dust upon the scale.\r\n    Redeem we time?--its loss we dearly buy.\r\n  What pleads Lorenzo for his high-prized sports?\r\n  He pleads time's numerous blanks; he loudly pleads\r\n  The straw-like trifles on life's common stream.\r\n  From whom those blanks and trifles, but from thee?\r\n  No blank, no trifle, nature made, or meant.                         80\r\n  Virtue, or purposed virtue, still be thine;\r\n  This cancels thy complaint at once, this leaves\r\n  In act no trifle, and no blank in time.\r\n  This greatens, fills, immortalizes all;\r\n  This, the bless'd art of turning all to gold;\r\n  This, the good heart's prerogative to raise\r\n  A royal tribute from the poorest hours;\r\n  Immense revenue! every moment pays.                                 88\r\n  If nothing more than purpose in thy power;\r\n  Thy purpose firm, is equal to the deed:\r\n  Who does the best his circumstance allows,\r\n  Does well, acts nobly; angels could no more.\r\n  Our outward act, indeed, admits restraint;\r\n  'Tis not in things o'er thought to domineer;\r\n  Guard well thy thought; our thoughts are heard in heaven.\r\n    On all-important time, through every age,\r\n  Though much, and warm, the wise have urged; the man\r\n  Is yet unborn, who duly weighs an hour.\r\n  \"I've lost a day\"--the prince who nobly cried\r\n  Had been an emperor without his crown;                             100\r\n  Of Rome? say, rather, lord of human race:\r\n  He spoke, as if deputed by mankind.\r\n  So should all speak; so reason speaks in all:\r\n  From the soft whispers of that God in man,\r\n  Why fly to folly, why to phrensy fly,\r\n  For rescue from the blessing we possess?\r\n  Time the supreme!--Time is eternity;\r\n  Pregnant with all eternity can give;\r\n  Pregnant with all that makes archangels smile.\r\n  Who murders time, he crushes in the birth                          110\r\n  A power ethereal, only not adored.\r\n    Ah! how unjust to Nature, and himself,\r\n  Is thoughtless, thankless, inconsistent man!\r\n  Like children babbling nonsense in their sports,\r\n  We censure Nature for a span too short;\r\n  That span too short, we tax as tedious too;\r\n  Torture invention, all expedients tire,\r\n  To lash the lingering moments into speed,\r\n  And whirl us (happy riddance!) from ourselves.\r\n  Art, brainless Art! our furious charioteer                         120\r\n  (For Nature's voice unstifled would recall),\r\n  Drives headlong towards the precipice of death;                    122\r\n  Death, most our dread; death thus more dreadful made:\r\n  Oh, what a riddle of absurdity!\r\n  Leisure is pain; takes off our chariot wheels;\r\n  How heavily we drag the load of life!\r\n  Blest leisure is our curse; like that of Cain,\r\n  It makes us wander; wander earth around,\r\n  To fly that tyrant, thought. As Atlas groan'd\r\n  The world beneath, we groan beneath an hour.                       130\r\n  We cry for mercy to the next amusement;\r\n  The next amusement mortgages our fields;\r\n  Slight inconvenience! prisons hardly frown,\r\n  From hateful time if prisons set us free.\r\n  Yet when Death kindly tenders us relief,\r\n  We call him cruel; years to moments shrink,\r\n  Ages to years. The telescope is turn'd.\r\n  To man's false optics (from his folly false),\r\n  Time, in advance, behind him hides his wings,\r\n  And seems to creep, decrepit with his age;                         140\r\n  Behold him, when pass'd by; what then is seen,\r\n  But his broad pinions swifter than the winds?\r\n  And all mankind, in contradiction strong,\r\n  Rueful, aghast! cry out on his career.\r\n    Leave to thy foes these errors and these ills;\r\n  To Nature just, their cause and cure explore.\r\n  Not short Heaven's bounty, boundless our expence;\r\n  No niggard, Nature; men are prodigals.\r\n  We waste, not use our time; we breathe, not live.\r\n  Time wasted is existence, used is life.                            150\r\n  And bare existence, man, to live ordain'd,\r\n  Wrings, and oppresses with enormous weight.\r\n  And why? since time was given for use, not waste,\r\n  Enjoin'd to fly; with tempest, tide, and stars,\r\n  To keep his speed, nor ever wait for man;\r\n  Time's use was doom'd a pleasure: waste, a pain;                   156\r\n  That man might feel his error, if unseen:\r\n  And, feeling, fly to labour for his cure;\r\n  Not, blundering, split on idleness for ease.\r\n  Life's cares are comforts; such by Heaven design'd;\r\n  He that has none, must make them, or be wretched.\r\n  Cares are employments; and without employ\r\n  The soul is on a rack; the rack of rest,                           163\r\n  To souls most adverse; action all their joy.\r\n    Here then, the riddle, mark'd above, unfolds;\r\n  Then time turns torment, when man turns a fool.\r\n  We rave, we wrestle, with great Nature's plan;\r\n  We thwart the Deity; and 'tis decreed,\r\n  Who thwart his will shall contradict their own.\r\n  Hence our unnatural quarrels with ourselves;                       170\r\n  Our thoughts at enmity; our bosom-broils;\r\n  We push Time from us, and we wish him back;\r\n  Lavish of lustrums, and yet fond of life;\r\n  Life we think long, and short; death seek, and shun;\r\n  Body and soul, like peevish man and wife,\r\n  United jar, and yet are loth to part.\r\n    Oh the dark days of vanity! while here,\r\n  How tasteless! and how terrible, when gone!\r\n  Gone! they ne'er go; when past, they haunt us still;\r\n  The spirit walks of every day deceased;                            180\r\n  And smiles an angel, or a fury frowns.\r\n  Nor death, nor life delight us. If time past,\r\n  And time possess'd, both pain us, what can please?\r\n  That which the Deity to please ordain'd,\r\n  Time used. The man who consecrates his hours\r\n  By vigorous effort, and an honest aim,\r\n  At once he draws the sting of life and death;\r\n  He walks with Nature; and her paths are peace.\r\n    Our error's cause and cure are seen: see next\r\n  Time's nature, origin, importance, speed;                          190\r\n  And thy great gain from urging his career.--\r\n  All-sensual man, because untouch'd, unseen,\r\n  He looks on time as nothing. Nothing else\r\n  Is truly man's; 'tis fortune's.--Time's a god.\r\n  Hast thou ne'er heard of Time's omnipotence?\r\n  For, or against, what wonders he can do,\r\n  And will? To stand blank neuter he disdains.\r\n  Not on those terms was Time (Heaven's stranger!) sent\r\n  On his important embassy to man.\r\n  Lorenzo! no: on the long-destined hour,                            200\r\n  From everlasting ages growing ripe,\r\n  That memorable hour of wondrous birth,\r\n  When the Dread Sire, on emanation bent,\r\n  And big with Nature, rising in his might,\r\n  Call'd forth creation (for then Time was born),\r\n  By Godhead streaming through a thousand worlds;\r\n  Not on those terms, from the great days of heaven,\r\n  From old Eternity's mysterious orb,\r\n  Was Time cut off, and cast beneath the skies;\r\n  The skies, which watch him in his new abode,                       210\r\n  Measuring his motions by revolving spheres;\r\n  That horologe machinery divine.\r\n  Hours, days, and months, and years, his children play,\r\n  Like numerous wings around him, as he flies:\r\n  Or, rather, as unequal plumes, they shape\r\n  His ample pinions, swift as darted flame,\r\n  To gain his goal, to reach his ancient rest,\r\n  And join anew Eternity his sire;\r\n  In his immutability to nest,\r\n  When worlds, that count his circles now, unhinged                  220\r\n  (Fate the loud signal sounding), headlong rush\r\n  To timeless night and chaos, whence they rose.\r\n    Why spur the speedy? why with levities\r\n  New wing thy short, short day's too rapid flight?                  224\r\n  Know'st thou, or what thou dost, or what is done?\r\n  Man flies from time, and time from man; too soon\r\n  In sad divorce this double flight must end:\r\n  And then where are we? where, Lorenzo! then\r\n  Thy sports? thy pomps?--I grant thee, in a state\r\n  Not unambitious; in the ruffled shroud,\r\n  Thy Parian tomb's triumphant arch beneath.\r\n  Has Death his fopperies? Then well may life                        232\r\n  Put on her plume, and in her rainbow shine.\r\n  Ye well-array'd! ye lilies of our land!\r\n  Ye lilies male! who neither toil nor spin\r\n  (As sister lilies might), if not so wise\r\n  As Solomon, more sumptuous to the sight!\r\n  Ye delicate! who nothing can support,\r\n  Yourselves most insupportable! for whom\r\n  The winter rose must blow, the sun put on                          240\r\n  A brighter beam in Leo; silky-soft\r\n  Favonius breathe still softer, or be chid;\r\n  And other worlds send odours, sauce, and song,\r\n  And robes, and notions, framed in foreign looms!\r\n  O ye Lorenzos of our age! who deem\r\n  One moment unamused, a misery\r\n  Not made for feeble man! who call aloud\r\n  For every bauble drivell'd o'er by sense;\r\n  For rattles, and conceits of every cast,\r\n  For change of follies, and relays of joy,                          250\r\n  To drag your patient through the tedious length\r\n  Of a short winter's day--say, sages! say,\r\n  Wit's oracles! say, dreamers of gay dreams!\r\n  How will you weather an eternal night,\r\n  Where such expedients fail?\r\n    O treacherous Conscience! while she seems to sleep\r\n  On rose and myrtle, lull'd with syren song;\r\n  While she seems, nodding o'er her charge, to drop                  258\r\n  On headlong appetite the slacken'd rein,\r\n  And give us up to licence, unrecall'd,\r\n  Unmark'd;--see, from behind her secret stand,\r\n  The sly informer minutes every fault,\r\n  And her dread diary with horror fills.\r\n  Not the gross act alone employs her pen;\r\n  She reconnoitres fancy's airy band,\r\n  A watchful foe! the formidable spy,\r\n  Listening, o'erhears the whispers of our camp:\r\n  Our dawning purposes of heart explores,\r\n  And steals our embryos of iniquity.\r\n  As all-rapacious usurers conceal                                   270\r\n  Their doomsday-book from all-consuming heirs;\r\n  Thus, with indulgence most severe, she treats\r\n  Us spendthrifts of inestimable time;\r\n  Unnoted, notes each moment misapplied;\r\n  In leaves more durable than leaves of brass,\r\n  Writes our whole history; which Death shall read\r\n  In every pale delinquent's private ear;\r\n  And Judgment publish; publish to more worlds\r\n  Than this; and endless age in groans resound.\r\n  Lorenzo, such that sleeper in thy breast!                          280\r\n  Such is her slumber; and her vengeance such\r\n  For slighted counsel; such thy future peace!\r\n  And think'st thou still thou canst be wise too soon?\r\n    But why on Time so lavish is my song?\r\n  On this great theme kind Nature keeps a school,\r\n  To teach her sons herself. Each night we die,\r\n  Each morn are born anew: each day, a life!\r\n  And shall we kill each day? If trifling kills;\r\n  Sure vice must butcher. Oh, what heaps of slain\r\n  Cry out for vengeance on us! Time destroy'd                        290\r\n  Is suicide, where more than blood is spilt.\r\n  Time flies, Death urges, knells call, Heaven invites,              292\r\n  Hell threatens: all exerts; in effort, all;\r\n  More than creation labours!--labours more?\r\n  And is there in creation what, amidst\r\n  This tumult universal, wing'd despatch,\r\n  And ardent energy, supinely yawns?--\r\n  Man sleeps; and man alone; and man, whose fate,\r\n  Fate irreversible, entire, extreme,\r\n  Endless, hair-hung, breeze-shaken, o'er the gulf                   300\r\n  A moment trembles; drops! and man, for whom\r\n  All else is in alarm! man, the sole cause\r\n  Of this surrounding storm! and yet he sleeps,\r\n  As the storm rock'd to rest.--Throw years away?\r\n  Throw empires, and be blameless. Moments seize;\r\n  Heaven's on their wing: a moment we may wish,\r\n  When worlds want wealth to buy. Bid Day stand still,\r\n  Bid him drive back his car, and re-import\r\n  The period past, re-give the given hour.\r\n  Lorenzo, more than miracles we want;                               310\r\n  Lorenzo--O for yesterdays to come!\r\n    Such is the language of the man awake;\r\n  His ardour such, for what oppresses thee.\r\n  And is his ardour vain, Lorenzo? No;\r\n  That more than miracle the gods indulge;\r\n  To-day is yesterday return'd; return'd\r\n  Full power'd to cancel, expiate, raise, adorn,\r\n  And reinstate us on the rock of peace.\r\n  Let it not share its predecessor's fate;\r\n  Nor, like its elder sisters, die a fool.                           320\r\n  Shall it evaporate in fume? fly off\r\n  Fuliginous, and stain us deeper still?\r\n  Shall we be poorer for the plenty pour'd?\r\n  More wretched for the clemencies of Heaven?\r\n    Where shall I find him? Angels! tell me where.\r\n  You know him: he is near you: point him out:                       326\r\n  Shall I see glories beaming from his brow?\r\n  Or trace his footsteps by the rising flowers?\r\n  Your golden wings, now hovering o'er him, shed\r\n  Protection; now, are waving in applause\r\n  To that bless'd son of foresight! lord of fate!\r\n  That awful independent on to-morrow!\r\n  Whose work is done; who triumphs in the past;                      333\r\n  Whose yesterdays look backwards with a smile;\r\n  Nor, like the Parthian, wound him as they fly;\r\n  That common but opprobrious lot! past hours,\r\n  If not by guilt, yet wound us by their flight,\r\n  If folly bounds our prospect by the grave,\r\n  All feeling of futurity benumb'd;\r\n  All god-like passion for eternals quench'd;                        340\r\n  All relish of realities expired;\r\n  Renounced all correspondence with the skies;\r\n  Our freedom chain'd; quite wingless our desire;\r\n  In sense dark-prison'd all that ought to soar;\r\n  Prone to the centre; crawling in the dust;\r\n  Dismounted every great and glorious aim;\r\n  Embruted every faculty divine;\r\n  Heart-buried in the rubbish of the world.\r\n  The world, that gulf of souls, immortal souls,\r\n  Souls elevate, angelic, wing'd with fire                           350\r\n  To reach the distant skies, and triumph there\r\n  On thrones, which shall not mourn their masters changed,\r\n  Though we from earth; ethereal, they that fell.\r\n  Such veneration due, O man, to man.\r\n    Who venerate themselves, the world despise.\r\n  For what, gay friend! is this escutcheon'd world,\r\n  Which hangs out death in one eternal night?\r\n  A night, that glooms us in the noontide ray,\r\n  And wraps our thought, at banquets, in the shroud.\r\n  Life's little stage is a small eminence,                           360\r\n  Inch-high the grave above; that home of man,\r\n  Where dwells the multitude: we gaze around;\r\n  We read their monuments; we sigh; and while\r\n  We sigh, we sink; and are what we deplored;\r\n  Lamenting, or lamented, all our lot!\r\n    Is Death at distance? No: he has been on thee;\r\n  And given sure earnest of his final blow.\r\n  These hours that lately smiled, where are they now?\r\n  Pallid to thought, and ghastly! drown'd, all drown'd\r\n  In that great deep, which nothing disembogues!                     370\r\n  And, dying, they bequeathed thee small renown.\r\n  The rest are on the wing: how fleet their flight!\r\n  Already has the fatal train took fire;\r\n  A moment, and the world's blown up to thee;\r\n  The sun is darkness, and the stars are dust.\r\n    'Tis greatly wise to talk with our past hours;\r\n  And ask them, what report they bore to heaven;\r\n  And how they might have borne more welcome news.\r\n  Their answers form what men experience call;\r\n  If Wisdom's friend, her best; if not, worst foe.                   380\r\n  \"Oh, reconcile them!\" kind Experience cries;\r\n  \"There's nothing here, but what as nothing weighs;\r\n  The more our joy, the more we know it vain;\r\n  And by success are tutor'd to despair.\"\r\n  Nor is it only thus, but must be so.\r\n  Who knows not this, though grey, is still a child.\r\n  Loose then from earth the grasp of fond desire,\r\n  Weigh anchor, and some happier clime explore.\r\n    Art thou so moor'd thou canst not disengage,\r\n  Nor give thy thoughts a ply to future scenes?                      390\r\n  Since, by life's passing breath, blown up from earth,\r\n  Light as the summer's dust, we take in air\r\n  A moment's giddy flight, and fall again;\r\n  Join the dull mass, increase the trodden soil,                     394\r\n  And sleep, till earth herself shall be no more;\r\n  Since then (as emmets, their small world o'erthrown)\r\n  We, sore-amazed, from out earth's ruins crawl,\r\n  And rise to fate extreme of foul or fair,\r\n  As man's own choice (controller of the skies!)\r\n  As man's despotic will, perhaps one hour\r\n  (O how omnipotent is time!) decrees;\r\n  Should not each warning give a strong alarm?\r\n  Warning, far less than that of bosom torn                          403\r\n  From bosom, bleeding o'er the sacred dead!\r\n  Should not each dial strike us as we pass,\r\n  Portentous, as the written wall, which struck,\r\n  O'er midnight bowls, the proud Assyrian pale,\r\n  Erewhile high-flush'd, with insolence, and wine?\r\n  Like that, the dial speaks; and points to thee,\r\n  Lorenzo! loth to break thy banquet up:                             410\r\n  \"O man, thy kingdom is departing from thee;\r\n  And, while it lasts, is emptier than my shade.\"\r\n  Its silent language such: nor need'st thou call\r\n  Thy Magi, to decipher what it means.\r\n  Know, like the Median, fate is in thy walls:\r\n  Dost ask, How? Whence? Belshazzar-like, amazed?\r\n  Man's make encloses the sure seeds of death;\r\n  Life feeds the murderer: ingrate! he thrives\r\n  On her own meal, and then his nurse devours.\r\n    But, here, Lorenzo, the delusion lies;                           420\r\n  That solar shadow, as it measures life,\r\n  It life resembles too: life speeds away\r\n  From point to point, though seeming to stand still.\r\n  The cunning fugitive is swift by stealth:\r\n  Too subtle is the movement to be seen;\r\n  Yet soon man's hour is up, and we are gone.\r\n  Warnings point out our danger; gnomons, time:\r\n  As these are useless when the sun is set:                          423\r\n  So those, but when more glorious reason shines.\r\n  Reason should judge in all; in reason's eye,\r\n  That sedentary shadow travels hard.\r\n  But such our gravitation to the wrong,\r\n  So prone our hearts to whisper what we wish,\r\n  'Tis later with the wise than he's aware:\r\n  A Wilmington goes slower than the sun:\r\n  And all mankind mistake their time of day;\r\n  Even age itself. Fresh hopes are hourly sown\r\n  In furrow'd brows. To gentle life's descent\r\n  We shut our eyes, and think it is a plain.\r\n  We take fair days in winter, for the spring;                       440\r\n  And turn our blessings into bane. Since oft\r\n  Man must compute that age he cannot feel,\r\n  He scarce believes he's older for his years.\r\n  Thus, at life's latest eve, we keep in store\r\n  One disappointment sure, to crown the rest;\r\n  The disappointment of a promised hour.\r\n    On this, or similar, Philander! thou,\r\n  Whose mind was moral, as the preacher's tongue;\r\n  And strong, to wield all science, worth the name;\r\n  How often we talk'd down the summer's sun,                         450\r\n  And cool'd our passions by the breezy stream!\r\n  How often thaw'd and shorten'd winter's eve,\r\n  By conflict kind, that struck out latent truth,\r\n  Best found, so sought; to the recluse more coy!\r\n  Thoughts disentangle passing o'er the lip;\r\n  Clean runs the thread; if not, 'tis thrown away,\r\n  Or kept to tie up nonsense for a song;\r\n  Song, fashionably fruitless; such as stains\r\n  The fancy, and unhallow'd passion fires;\r\n  Chiming her saints to Cytherea's[8] fane.                          460\r\n    Know'st thou, Lorenzo! what a friend contains?                   461\r\n  As bees mix'd nectar draw from fragrant flowers,\r\n  So men from friendship, wisdom and delight;\r\n  Twins tied by Nature, if they part, they die.\r\n  Hast thou no friend to set thy mind abroach?\r\n  Good sense will stagnate. Thoughts shut up, want air,\r\n  And spoil, like bales unopen'd to the sun.\r\n  Had thought been all, sweet speech had been denied;\r\n  Speech, thought's canal! speech, thought's criterion too!\r\n  Thought in the mine, may come forth gold, or dross;\r\n  When coin'd in words, we know its real worth.                      471\r\n  If sterling, store it for thy future use;\r\n  'Twill buy thee benefit; perhaps, renown.\r\n  Thought, too, deliver'd, is the more possess'd;\r\n  Teaching, we learn; and, giving, we retain\r\n  The births of intellect; when dumb, forgot.\r\n  Speech ventilates our intellectual fire;\r\n  Speech burnishes our mental magazine;\r\n  Brightens, for ornament; and whets, for use.\r\n  What numbers, sheathed in erudition, lie,                          480\r\n  Plunged to the hilts in venerable tomes,\r\n  And rusted in; who might have borne an edge,\r\n  And play'd a sprightly beam, if born to speech;\r\n  If born bless'd heirs of half their mother's tongue!\r\n  'Tis thought's exchange, which, like th' alternate push\r\n  Of waves conflicting, breaks the learned scum,\r\n  And defecates the student's standing pool.\r\n    In contemplation is his proud resource?\r\n  'Tis poor, as proud, by converse unsustain'd.\r\n  Rude thought runs wild in contemplation's field;                   490\r\n  Converse, the menage, breaks it to the bit\r\n  Of due restraint; and emulation's spur\r\n  Gives graceful energy, by rivals awed.\r\n  'Tis converse qualifies for solitude;\r\n  As exercise, for salutary rest.                                    495\r\n  By that untutor'd, contemplation raves;\r\n  And Nature's fool, by wisdom is undone.\r\n    Wisdom, though richer than Peruvian mines,\r\n  And sweeter than the sweet ambrosial hive,\r\n  What is she, but the means of happiness?\r\n  That unobtain'd, than folly more a fool;\r\n  A melancholy fool, without her bells.\r\n  Friendship, the means of wisdom, richly gives                      503\r\n  The precious end, which makes our wisdom wise.\r\n  Nature, in zeal for human amity,\r\n  Denies, or damps, an undivided joy.\r\n  Joy is an import; joy is an exchange;\r\n  Joy flies monopolists: it calls for two;\r\n  Rich fruit! heaven-planted! never pluck'd by one.\r\n  Needful auxiliars are our friends, to give                         510\r\n  To social man true relish of himself.\r\n  Full on ourselves, descending in a line,\r\n  Pleasure's bright beam is feeble in delight:\r\n  Delight intense, is taken by rebound;\r\n  Reverberated pleasures fire the breast.\r\n    Celestial happiness, whene'er she stoops\r\n  To visit earth, one shrine the goddess finds,\r\n  And one alone, to make her sweet amends\r\n  For absent heaven--the bosom of a friend;\r\n  Where heart meets heart, reciprocally soft,                        520\r\n  Each other's pillow to repose divine.\r\n  Beware the counterfeit: in passion's flame\r\n  Hearts melt, but melt like ice, soon harder froze.\r\n  True love strikes root in reason; passion's foe:\r\n  Virtue alone entenders us for life:\r\n  I wrong her much--entenders us for ever:\r\n  Of friendship's fairest fruits, the fruit most fair\r\n  Is virtue kindling at a rival fire,\r\n  And, emulously, rapid in her race.                                 529\r\n  O the soft enmity! endearing strife!\r\n  This carries friendship to her noontide point,\r\n  And gives the rivet of eternity.\r\n    From friendship, which outlives my former themes,\r\n  Glorious survivor of old time and death;\r\n  From friendship, thus, that flower of heavenly seed,\r\n  The wise extract earth's most Hyblean bliss,\r\n  Superior wisdom, crown'd with smiling joy.\r\n    But for whom blossoms this Elysian flower?\r\n  Abroad they find, who cherish it at home.\r\n  Lorenzo! pardon what my love extorts,                              540\r\n  An honest love, and not afraid to frown.\r\n  Though choice of follies fasten on the great,\r\n  None clings more obstinate, than fancy, fond\r\n  That sacred friendship is their easy prey;\r\n  Caught by the wafture of a golden lure,\r\n  Or fascination of a high-born smile.\r\n  Their smiles, the great, and the coquette, throw out\r\n  For others' hearts, tenacious of their own;\r\n  And we no less of ours, when such the bait.\r\n  Ye fortune's cofferers! ye powers of wealth!                       550\r\n  Can gold gain friendship? Impudence of hope!\r\n  As well mere man an angel might beget.\r\n  Love, and love only, is the loan for love.\r\n  Lorenzo! pride repress; nor hope to find\r\n  A friend, but what has found a friend in thee.\r\n  All like the purchase; few the price will pay;\r\n  And this makes friends such miracles below.\r\n    What if (since daring on so nice a theme)\r\n  I show thee friendship delicate, as dear,\r\n  Of tender violations apt to die?                                   560\r\n  Reserve will wound it; and distrust, destroy.\r\n  Deliberate on all things with thy friend.\r\n  But since friends grow not thick on every bough,                   563\r\n  Nor every friend unrotten at the core;\r\n  First, on thy friend, deliberate with thyself;\r\n  Pause, ponder, sift; not eager in the choice,\r\n  Nor jealous of the chosen; fixing, fix;\r\n  Judge before friendship, then confide till death.\r\n  Well, for thy friend; but nobler far for thee;\r\n  How gallant danger for earth's highest prize!                      570\r\n  A friend is worth all hazards we can run.\r\n  \"Poor is the friendless master of a world:\r\n  A world in purchase for a friend is gain.\"\r\n    So sung he (angels hear that angel sing!\r\n  Angels from friendship gather half their joy),\r\n  So sung Philander, as his friend went round\r\n  In the rich ichor, in the generous blood\r\n  Of Bacchus, purple god of joyous wit,\r\n  A brow solute, and ever-laughing eye.\r\n  He drank long health, and virtue, to his friend;                   580\r\n  His friend, who warm'd him more, who more inspired.\r\n  Friendship's the wine of life; but friendship new\r\n  (Not such was his) is neither strong, nor pure.\r\n  O for the bright complexion, cordial warmth,\r\n  And elevating spirit, of a friend,\r\n  For twenty summers ripening by my side;\r\n  All feculence of falsehood long thrown down;\r\n  All social virtues rising in his soul;\r\n  As crystal clear; and smiling, as they rise!\r\n  Here nectar flows; it sparkles in our sight;                       590\r\n  Rich to the taste, and genuine from the heart.\r\n  High-flavour'd bliss for gods! on earth how rare!\r\n  On earth how lost!--Philander is no more.\r\n    Think'st thou the theme intoxicates my song?\r\n  Am I too warm?--Too warm I cannot be.\r\n  I loved him much; but now I love him more.\r\n  Like birds, whose beauties languish, half-conceal'd,               597\r\n  Till, mounted on the wing, their glossy plumes\r\n  Expanded shine with azure, green, and gold;\r\n  How blessings brighten as they take their flight!\r\n  His flight Philander took; his upward flight,\r\n  If ever soul ascended. Had he dropp'd\r\n  (That eagle genius!), oh! had he let fall\r\n  One feather as he flew; I, then, had wrote,                        604\r\n  What friends might flatter; prudent foes forbear;\r\n  Rivals scarce damn; and Zoilus reprieve.\r\n  Yet what I can, I must: it were profane\r\n  To quench a glory lighted at the skies,\r\n  And cast in shadows his illustrious close.\r\n  Strange! the theme most affecting, most sublime,                   610\r\n  Momentous most to man, should sleep unsung!\r\n  And yet it sleeps, by genius unawaked,\r\n  Paynim or Christian; to the blush of wit.\r\n  Man's highest triumph! man's profoundest fall!\r\n  The death-bed of the just! is yet undrawn\r\n  By mortal hand; it merits a divine:\r\n  Angels should paint it, angels ever there;\r\n  There, on a post of honour, and of joy.\r\n    Dare I presume, then? But Philander bids;\r\n  And glory tempts, and inclination calls--                          620\r\n  Yet am I struck; as struck the soul, beneath\r\n  Aerial groves' impenetrable gloom;\r\n  Or, in some mighty ruin's solemn shade;\r\n  Or, gazing by pale lamps on high-born dust,\r\n  In vaults; thin courts of poor unflatter'd kings;\r\n  Or, at the midnight altar's hallow'd flame.\r\n  Is it religion to proceed? I pause--\r\n  And enter, awed, the temple of my theme.\r\n  Is it his death-bed? No: it is his shrine:\r\n  Behold him, there, just rising to a god.                           630\r\n    The chamber where the good man meets his fate,                   631\r\n  Is privileged beyond the common walk\r\n  Of virtuous life, quite in the verge of heaven.\r\n  Fly, ye profane! if not, draw near with awe,\r\n  Receive the blessing, and adore the chance,\r\n  That threw in this Bethesda your disease;\r\n  If unrestored by this, despair your cure.\r\n  For here, resistless demonstration dwells;\r\n  A death-bed's a detector of the heart.\r\n  Here tired Dissimulation drops her mask,                           640\r\n  Through life's grimace, that mistress of the scene!\r\n  Here real and apparent are the same.\r\n  You see the man; you see his hold on heaven;\r\n  If sound his virtue; as Philander's, sound.\r\n  Heaven waits not the last moment; owns her friends\r\n  On this side death; and points them out to men,\r\n  A lecture, silent, but of sovereign power!\r\n  To vice, confusion; and to virtue, peace.\r\n    Whatever farce the boastful hero plays,\r\n  Virtue alone has majesty in death;                                 650\r\n  And greater still, the more the tyrant frowns.\r\n  Philander! he severely frown'd on thee.\r\n  \"No warning given!

Phoebe!--or dost hear\r\n  With higher gust, fair P----d of the skies?\r\n  Is that the soft enchantment calls thee down,\r\n  More powerful than of old Circean charm?\r\n  Come; but from heavenly banquets with thee bring\r\n  The soul of song, and whisper in my ear                             50\r\n  The theft divine; or in propitious dreams\r\n  (For dreams are thine) transfuse it through the breast              52\r\n  Of thy first votary--but not thy last;\r\n  If, like thy namesake, thou art ever kind.\r\n    And kind thou wilt be; kind on such a theme;\r\n  A theme so like thee, a quite lunar theme,\r\n  Soft, modest, melancholy, female, fair!\r\n  A theme that rose all pale, and told my soul,\r\n  'Twas Night; on her fond hopes perpetual night;\r\n  A night which struck a damp, a deadlier damp,                       60\r\n  Than that which smote me from Philander's tomb.\r\n  Narcissa[12] follows, ere his tomb is closed.\r\n  Woes cluster; rare are solitary woes;\r\n  They love a train, they tread each other's heel;\r\n  Her death invades his mournful right, and claims\r\n  The grief that started from my lids for him:\r\n  Seizes the faithless, alienated tear,\r\n  Or shares it, ere it falls. So frequent Death,\r\n  Sorrow he more than causes, he confounds;\r\n  For human sighs his rival strokes contend,                          70\r\n  And make distress, distraction.

Man's mortality\r\n  Was then transferr'd to death; and heaven's duration\r\n  Unalienably seal'd to this frail frame,\r\n  This child of dust--Man, all-immortal! hail;\r\n  Hail, Heaven! all lavish of strange gifts to man!\r\n  Thine all the glory; man's the boundless bliss.                    300\r\n    Where am I rapt by this triumphant theme?\r\n  On Christian joy's exulting wing, above\r\n  Th' Aonian mount?--Alas! small cause for joy!\r\n  What if to pain immortal? if extent\r\n  Of being, to preclude a close of woe?\r\n  Where, then, my boast of immortality?\r\n  I boast it still, though cover'd o'er with guilt;\r\n  For guilt, not innocence, his life he pour'd;\r\n  'Tis guilt alone can justify his death;\r\n  Nor that, unless his death can justify                             310\r\n  Relenting guilt in Heaven's indulgent sight.\r\n  If, sick of folly, I relent; he writes\r\n  My name in heaven with that inverted spear\r\n  (A spear deep-dipp'd in blood!) which pierced his side,\r\n  And open'd there a font for all mankind,\r\n  Who strive, who combat crimes, to drink, and live:\r\n  This, only this, subdues the fear of death.\r\n    And what is this?--Survey the wondrous cure:\r\n  And at each step, let higher wonder rise!\r\n  \"Pardon for infinite offence! and pardon                           320\r\n  Through means that speak its value infinite!\r\n  A pardon bought with blood! with blood divine!\r\n  With blood divine of Him I made my foe!\r\n  Persisted to provoke! though woo'd and awed,\r\n  Bless'd and chastised, a flagrant rebel still!                     325\r\n  A rebel, 'midst the thunders of his throne!\r\n  Nor I alone! a rebel universe!\r\n  My species up in arms! not one exempt!\r\n  Yet for the foulest of the foul, he dies,\r\n  Most joy'd, for the redeem'd from deepest guilt!\r\n  As if our race were held of highest rank;\r\n  And Godhead dearer, as more kind to man!\"                          332\r\n    Bound, every heart! and every bosom, burn!\r\n  O what a scale of miracles is here!\r\n  Its lowest round, high planted on the skies;\r\n  Its towering summit lost beyond the thought\r\n  Of man or angel!

Shall I question loud\r\n  The thunder, if in that th' Almighty dwells?\r\n  Or holds He furious storms in straiten'd reins,\r\n  And bids fierce whirlwinds wheel his rapid car?\r\n    What mean these questions?--Trembling I retract;\r\n  My prostrate soul adores the present God:\r\n  Praise I a distant deity? He tunes                                 400\r\n  My voice (if tuned); the nerve, that writes, sustains:\r\n  Wrapp'd in his being, I resound his praise:\r\n  But though past all diffused, without a shore,\r\n  His essence; local is his throne (as meet),\r\n  To gather the dispersed (as standards call\r\n  The listed from afar): to fix a point,\r\n  A central point, collective of his sons,\r\n  Since finite every nature but his own.\r\n    The nameless He, whose nod is nature's birth;\r\n  And nature's shield, the shadow of his hand;                       410\r\n  Her dissolution, his suspended smile!\r\n  The great First-Last! pavilion'd high he sits,\r\n  In darkness from excessive splendour borne,\r\n  By gods unseen, unless through lustre lost.\r\n  His glory, to created glory, bright,\r\n  As that to central horrors; he looks down\r\n  On all that soars; and spans immensity.\r\n    Though night unnumber'd worlds unfolds to view,\r\n  Boundless creation! what art thou?

'twas creation more sublime;\r\n  Redemption! 'twas the labour of the skies;\r\n  Far more than labour--it was death in heaven.\r\n  A truth so strange! 'twere bold to think it true;\r\n  If not far bolder still to disbelieve.                             459\r\n    Here pause, and ponder--Was there death in heaven?\r\n  What then on earth? on earth, which struck the blow?\r\n  Who struck it? Who?--O how is man enlarged,                        462\r\n  Seen through this medium! How the pigmy towers!\r\n  How counterpoised his origin from dust!\r\n  How counterpoised to dust his sad return!\r\n  How voided his vast distance from the skies!\r\n  How near he presses on the seraph's wing!\r\n  Which is the seraph? Which the born of clay?\r\n  How this demonstrates, through the thickest cloud\r\n  Of guilt, and clay condensed, the son of heaven!                   470\r\n  The double son; the made, and the re-made!\r\n  And shall heaven's double property be lost?\r\n  Man's double madness only can destroy.\r\n  To man the bleeding cross has promised all;\r\n  The bleeding cross has sworn eternal grace;\r\n  Who gave his life, what grace shall he deny?\r\n  O ye who, from this Rock of Ages, leap,\r\n  Apostates, plunging headlong in the deep!\r\n  What cordial joy, what consolation strong,\r\n  Whatever winds arise, or billows roll,                             480\r\n  Our interest in the Master of the storm!\r\n  Cling there, and in wreck'd nature's ruins smile;\r\n  While vile apostates tremble in a calm.\r\n    Man! know thyself. All wisdom centres there;\r\n  To none man seems ignoble, but to man;\r\n  Angels that grandeur, men o'erlook, admire:\r\n  How long shall human nature be their book,\r\n  Degenerate mortal! and unread by thee?\r\n  The beam dim reason sheds shows wonders there;\r\n  What high contents! illustrious faculties!                         490\r\n  But the grand comment, which displays at full\r\n  Our human height, scarce sever'd from divine,\r\n  By heaven composed, was publish'd on the Cross.\r\n    Who looks on that, and sees not in himself\r\n  An awful stranger, a terrestrial god?                              495\r\n  A glorious partner with the Deity\r\n  In that high attribute, immortal life?\r\n  If a god bleeds, he bleeds not for a worm:\r\n  I gaze, and, as I gaze, my mounting soul\r\n  Catches strange fire, eternity! at thee;\r\n  And drops the world--or rather, more enjoys:\r\n  How changed the face of nature! how improved!                      502\r\n  What seem'd a chaos, shines a glorious world,\r\n  Or, what a world, an Eden; heighten'd all!\r\n  It is another scene! another self!\r\n  And still another, as time rolls along;\r\n  And that a self far more illustrious still.\r\n  Beyond long ages, yet roll'd up in shades\r\n  Unpierced by bold conjecture's keenest ray,\r\n  What evolutions of surprising fate!                                510\r\n  How nature opens, and receives my soul\r\n  In boundless walks of raptured thought! where gods\r\n  Encounter and embrace me! What new births\r\n  Of strange adventure, foreign to the sun,\r\n  Where what now charms, perhaps, whate'er exists,\r\n  Old time, and fair creation, are forgot!\r\n    Is this extravagant? Of man we form\r\n  Extravagant conception, to be just:\r\n  Conception unconfined wants wings to reach him:\r\n  Beyond its reach, the Godhead only, more.                          520\r\n  He, the great Father! kindled at one flame\r\n  The world of rationals; one spirit pour'd\r\n  From spirit's awful fountain; pour'd himself\r\n  Through all their souls; but not in equal stream,\r\n  Profuse, or frugal, of th' inspiring God,\r\n  As his wise plan demanded; and when past\r\n  Their various trials, in their various spheres,\r\n  If they continue rational, as made,\r\n  Resorbs them all into himself again;                               529\r\n  His throne their centre, and his smile their crown.\r\n    Why doubt we, then, the glorious truth to sing,\r\n  Though yet unsung, as deem'd, perhaps, too bold?\r\n  Angels are men of a superior kind;\r\n  Angels are men in lighter habit clad,\r\n  High o'er celestial mountains wing'd in flight;\r\n  And men are angels, loaded for an hour,\r\n  Who wade this miry vale, and climb with pain,\r\n  And slippery step, the bottom of the steep.\r\n  Angels their failings, mortals have their praise;\r\n  While here, of corps ethereal, such enroll'd,                      540\r\n  And summon'd to the glorious standard soon,\r\n  Which flames eternal crimson through the skies.\r\n  Nor are our brothers thoughtless of their kin,\r\n  Yet absent; but not absent from their love.\r\n  Michael has fought our battles; Raphael sung\r\n  Our triumphs; Gabriel on our errands flown,\r\n  Sent by the Sovereign: and are these, O Man!\r\n  Thy friends, thy warm allies? and thou (shame burn\r\n  The cheek to cinder!) rival to the brute?\r\n    Religion's all. Descending from the skies                        550\r\n  To wretched man, the goddess, in her left,\r\n  Holds out this world, and, in her right, the next;\r\n  Religion! the sole voucher man is man;\r\n  Supporter sole of man above himself;\r\n  Even in this night of frailty, change, and death,\r\n  She gives the soul a soul that acts a god.\r\n  Religion! Providence! an After-state!\r\n  Here is firm footing; here is solid rock!\r\n  This can support us; all is sea besides;\r\n  Sinks under us; bestorms, and then devours.                        560\r\n  His hand the good man fastens on the skies,\r\n  And bids earth roll, nor feels her idle whirl.\r\n    As when a wretch, from thick polluted air,                       563\r\n  Darkness, and stench, and suffocating damps,\r\n  And dungeon horrors, by kind fate, discharged,\r\n  Climbs some fair eminence, where ether pure\r\n  Surrounds him, and Elysian prospects rise,\r\n  His heart exults, his spirits cast their load;\r\n  As if new-born, he triumphs in the change;\r\n  So joys the soul, when, from inglorious aims,\r\n  And sordid sweets, from feculence and froth                        571\r\n  Of ties terrestrial, set at large, she mounts\r\n  To reason's region, her own element,\r\n  Breathes hopes immortal, and affects the skies.\r\n    Religion! thou the soul of happiness;\r\n  And, groaning Calvary, of thee! there shine\r\n  The noblest truths; there strongest motives sting;\r\n  There sacred violence assaults the soul;\r\n  There, nothing but compulsion is forborne.\r\n  Can love allure us? or can terror awe?                             580\r\n  He weeps!--the falling drop puts out the sun;\r\n  He sighs--the sigh earth's deep foundation shakes.\r\n  If in his love so terrible, what then\r\n  His wrath inflamed? his tenderness on fire?\r\n  Like soft, smooth oil, outblazing other fires?\r\n  Can prayer, can praise avert it?--Thou, my all!\r\n  My theme! my inspiration! and my crown!\r\n  My strength in age! my rise in low estate!\r\n  My soul's ambition, pleasure, wealth!--my world!\r\n  My light in darkness! and my life in death!                        590\r\n  My boast through time! bliss through eternity!\r\n  Eternity, too short to speak thy praise!\r\n  Or fathom thy profound of love to man!\r\n  To man of men the meanest, even to me;\r\n  My sacrifice! my God!--what things are these!\r\n    What then art Thou? by what name shall I call thee?--\r\n  Knew I the name devout archangels use,                             597\r\n  Devout archangels should the name enjoy,\r\n  By me unrivall'd; thousands more sublime,\r\n  None half so dear as that which, though unspoke,\r\n  Still glows at heart: O how omnipotence\r\n  Is lost in love! Thou great Philanthropist!\r\n  Father of angels! but the friend of man!                           603\r\n  Like Jacob, fondest of the younger born!\r\n  Thou, who didst save him, snatch the smoking brand\r\n  From out the flames, and quench it in thy blood!\r\n  How art thou pleased, by bounty to distress!\r\n  To make us groan beneath our gratitude,\r\n  Too big for birth! to favour, and confound;\r\n  To challenge, and to distance all return!                          610\r\n  Of lavish love stupendous heights to soar,\r\n  And leave praise panting in the distant vale!\r\n  Thy right, too great, defrauds thee of thy due;\r\n  And sacrilegious our sublimest song.\r\n  But since the naked will obtains thy smile,\r\n  Beneath this monument of praise unpaid,\r\n  And future life symphonious to my strain,\r\n  (That noblest hymn to heaven!) for ever lie\r\n  Entomb'd my fear of death! and every fear,\r\n  The dread of every evil, but thy frown.                            620\r\n    Whom see I yonder, so demurely smile?\r\n  Laughter a labour, and might break their rest.\r\n  Ye quietists, in homage to the skies!\r\n  Serene! of soft address! who mildly make\r\n  An unobtrusive tender of your hearts,\r\n  Abhorring violence! who halt indeed;\r\n  But, for the blessing, wrestle not with Heaven!\r\n  Think you my song too turbulent? too warm?\r\n  Are passions, then, the Pagans of the soul?\r\n  Reason alone baptized? alone ordain'd                              630\r\n  To touch things sacred? Oh for warmer still!                       631\r\n  Guilt chills my zeal, and age benumbs my powers;\r\n  Oh for an humbler heart, and prouder song!\r\n  Thou, my much-injured theme! with that soft eye,\r\n  Which melted o'er doom'd Salem, deign to look\r\n  Compassion to the coldness of my breast;\r\n  And pardon to the winter in my strain.\r\n    O ye cold-hearted, frozen, formalists!\r\n  On such a theme, 'tis impious to be calm;\r\n  Passion is reason, transport temper, here.                         640\r\n  Shall Heaven, which gave us ardour, and has shown\r\n  Her own for man so strongly, not disdain\r\n  What smooth emollients in theology,\r\n  Recumbent virtue's downy doctors preach,\r\n  That prose of piety, a lukewarm praise?\r\n  Rise odours sweet from incense uninflamed?\r\n  Devotion, when lukewarm, is undevout;\r\n  But when it glows, its heat is struck to heaven;\r\n  To human hearts her golden harps are strung;\r\n  High heaven's orchestra chants amen to man.                        650\r\n    Hear I, or dream I hear, their distant strain,\r\n  Sweet to the soul, and tasting strong of heaven,\r\n  Soft-wafted on celestial pity's plume,\r\n  Through the vast spaces of the universe,\r\n  To cheer me in this melancholy gloom?\r\n  Oh, when will death (now stingless), like a friend,\r\n  Admit me of their choir? Oh, when will death\r\n  This mouldering, old, partition-wall throw down?\r\n  Give beings, one in nature, one abode?\r\n  O Death divine! that givest us to the skies!                       660\r\n  Great future! glorious patron of the past,\r\n  And present! when shall I thy shrine adore?\r\n  From nature's continent, immensely wide,\r\n  Immensely bless'd, this little isle of life,\r\n  This dark, incarcerating colony,                                   665\r\n  Divides us. Happy day! that breaks our chain;\r\n  That manumits;[15] that calls from exile home;\r\n  That leads to nature's great metropolis,\r\n  And re-admits us, through the guardian hand\r\n  Of elder brothers, to our Father's throne;\r\n  Who hears our Advocate, and, through his wounds\r\n  Beholding man, allows that tender name.                            672\r\n  'Tis this makes Christian triumph a command:\r\n  'Tis this makes joy a duty to the wise;\r\n  'Tis impious in a good man to be sad.\r\n    See thou, Lorenzo! where hangs all our hope?\r\n  Touch'd by the Cross, we live; or, more than die;\r\n  That touch which touch'd not angels; more divine\r\n  Than that which touch'd confusion into form,\r\n  And darkness into glory; partial touch!                            680\r\n  Ineffably pre-eminent regard!\r\n  Sacred to man, and sovereign through the whole\r\n  Long golden chain of miracles, which hangs\r\n  From heaven through all duration, and supports\r\n  In one illustrious and amazing plan,\r\n  Thy welfare, nature! and thy God's renown.\r\n  That touch, with charm celestial, heals the soul\r\n  Diseased, drives pain from guilt, lights life in death,\r\n  Turns earth to heaven, to heavenly thrones transforms\r\n  The ghastly ruins of the mouldering tomb.                          690\r\n    Dost ask me when? When He who died returns;\r\n  Returns, how changed! Where then the man of woe?\r\n  In glory's terrors all the Godhead burns;\r\n  And all his courts, exhausted by the tide\r\n  Of deities triumphant in his train,\r\n  Leave a stupendous solitude in heaven;\r\n  Replenish'd soon, replenish'd with increase\r\n  Of pomp, and multitude; a radiant band                             698\r\n  Of angels new; of angels from the tomb.\r\n    Is this by fancy thrown remote? and rise\r\n  Dark doubts between the promise and event?\r\n  I send thee not to volumes for thy cure;\r\n  Read nature; nature is a friend to truth;\r\n  Nature is Christian; preaches to mankind;\r\n  And bids dead matter aid us in our creed.\r\n  Hast thou ne'er seen the comet's flaming flight?\r\n  Th' illustrious stranger passing, terror sheds\r\n  On gazing nations; from his fiery train\r\n  Of length enormous, takes his ample round                          709\r\n  Through depths of ether; coasts unnumber'd worlds,\r\n  Of more than solar glory; doubles wide\r\n  Heaven's mighty cape; and then revisits earth,\r\n  From the long travel of a thousand years.\r\n  Thus, at the destined period, shall return\r\n  He, once on earth, who bids the comet blaze:\r\n  And, with him, all our triumph o'er the tomb.\r\n    Nature is dumb on this important point;\r\n  Or hope precarious in low whisper breathes;\r\n  Faith speaks aloud, distinct; even adders hear;\r\n  But turn, and dart into the dark again.                            720\r\n  Faith builds a bridge across the gulf of death,\r\n  To break the shock blind nature cannot shun,\r\n  And lands thought smoothly on the farther shore.\r\n  Death's terror is the mountain faith removes;\r\n  That mountain barrier between man and peace.\r\n  'Tis faith disarms destruction; and absolves\r\n  From every clamorous charge, the guiltless tomb.\r\n    Why disbelieve? Lorenzo!--\"Reason bids,\r\n  All-sacred reason.\"--Hold her sacred still;\r\n  Nor shalt thou want a rival in thy flame:                          730\r\n  All-sacred reason! source, and soul, of all\r\n  Demanding praise, on earth, or earth above!                        732\r\n  My heart is thine: deep in its inmost folds,\r\n  Live thou with life; live dearer of the two.\r\n  Wear I the blessed cross, by fortune stamp'd\r\n  On passive nature, before thought was born?\r\n  My birth's blind bigot! fired with local zeal!\r\n  No; reason re-baptized me when adult;\r\n  Weigh'd true, and false, in her impartial scale;\r\n  My heart became the convert of my head;                            740\r\n  And made that choice, which once was but my fate.\r\n  \"On argument alone my faith is built:\"\r\n  Reason pursued is faith; and, unpursued\r\n  Where proof invites, 'tis reason, then, no more:\r\n  And such our proof, that, or our faith is right,\r\n  Or reason lies, and Heaven design'd it wrong:\r\n  Absolve we this?

I grant the Muse\r\n  Has often blush'd at her degenerate sons,\r\n  Retain'd by sense to plead her filthy cause;\r\n  To raise the low, to magnify the mean,\r\n  And subtilize the gross into refined:\r\n  As if to magic numbers' powerful charm                              10\r\n  'Twas given, to make a civet of their song\r\n  Obscene, and sweeten ordure to perfume.\r\n  Wit, a true Pagan, deifies the brute,\r\n  And lifts our swine-enjoyments from the mire.\r\n    The fact notorious, nor obscure the cause.\r\n  We wear the chains of pleasure and of pride.\r\n  These share the man; and these distract him too;\r\n  Draw different ways, and clash in their commands.\r\n  Pride, like an eagle, builds among the stars;\r\n  But pleasure, lark-like, nests upon the ground.                     20\r\n  Joys shared by brute creation, pride resents;                       21\r\n  Pleasure embraces: man would both enjoy,\r\n  And both at once: a point so hard, how gain!\r\n  But, what can't wit, when stung by strong desire?\r\n    Wit dares attempt this arduous enterprise.\r\n  Since joys of sense can't rise to reason's taste;\r\n  In subtle sophistry's laborious forge,\r\n  Wit hammers out a reason new, that stoops\r\n  To sordid scenes, and meets them with applause.\r\n  Wit calls the graces the chaste zone to loose;                      30\r\n  Nor less than a plump god to fill the bowl:\r\n  A thousand phantoms, and a thousand spells,\r\n  A thousand opiates scatters, to delude,\r\n  To fascinate, inebriate, lay asleep,\r\n  And the fool'd mind delightfully confound.\r\n  Thus that which shock'd the judgment, shocks no more;\r\n  That which gave Pride offence, no more offends.\r\n  Pleasure and Pride, by nature mortal foes,\r\n  At war eternal, which in man shall reign,\r\n  By Wit's address, patch up a fatal peace,                           40\r\n  And hand in hand lead on the rank debauch,\r\n  From rank refined to delicate and gay.\r\n  Art, cursed Art! wipes off th' indebted blush\r\n  From Nature's cheek, and bronzes every shame.\r\n  Man smiles in ruin, glories in his guilt,\r\n  And infamy stands candidate for praise.\r\n    All writ by man in favour of the soul,\r\n  These sensual ethics far, in bulk, transcend.\r\n  The flowers of eloquence, profusely pour'd\r\n  O'er spotted vice, fill half the letter'd world.                    50\r\n  Can powers of genius exorcise their page,\r\n  And consecrate enormities with song?\r\n    But let not these inexpiable strains\r\n  Condemn the Muse that knows her dignity;\r\n  Nor meanly stops at time, but holds the world                       55\r\n  As 'tis, in nature's ample field, a point,\r\n  A point in her esteem; from whence to start,\r\n  And run the round of universal space,\r\n  To visit being universal there,\r\n  And being's source, that utmost flight of mind!\r\n  Yet, spite of this so vast circumference,\r\n  Well knows, but what is moral, nought is great.                     62\r\n  Sing syrens only? Do not angels sing?\r\n  There is in Poesy a decent pride,\r\n  Which well becomes her when she speaks to Prose,\r\n  Her younger sister; haply, not more wise.\r\n    Think'st thou, Lorenzo! to find pastimes here?\r\n  No guilty passion blown into a flame,\r\n  No foible flatter'd, dignity disgraced,\r\n  No fairy field of fiction, all on flower,                           70\r\n  No rainbow colours here, or silken tale:\r\n  But solemn counsels, images of awe,\r\n  Truths, which eternity lets fall on man\r\n  With double weight, through these revolving spheres,\r\n  This death-deep silence, and incumbent shade:\r\n  Thoughts, such as shall revisit your last hour;\r\n  Visit uncall'd, and live when life expires;\r\n  And thy dark pencil, Midnight! darker still\r\n  In melancholy dipp'd, embrowns the whole.\r\n    Yet this, even this, my laughter-loving friends!                  80\r\n  Lorenzo! and thy brothers of the smile!\r\n  If, what imports you most, can most engage,\r\n  Shall steal your ear, and chain you to my song.\r\n  Or if you fail me, know, the wise shall taste\r\n  The truths I sing; the truths I sing shall feel;\r\n  And, feeling, give assent; and their assent\r\n  Is ample recompence; is more than praise.\r\n  But chiefly thine, O Lichfield! nor mistake;\r\n  Think not unintroduced I force my way;                              89\r\n  Narcissa, not unknown, not unallied,\r\n  By virtue, or by blood, illustrious youth!\r\n  To thee, from blooming amaranthine bowers,\r\n  Where all the language harmony, descends\r\n  Uncall'd, and asks admittance for the Muse:\r\n  A Muse that will not pain thee with thy praise;\r\n  Thy praise she drops, by nobler still inspired.\r\n    O Thou! Blest Spirit! whether the supreme,\r\n  Great antemundane Father! in whose breast\r\n  Embryo creation, unborn being, dwelt,\r\n  And all its various revolutions roll'd                             100\r\n  Present, though future; prior to themselves;\r\n  Whose breath can blow it into nought again;\r\n  Or, from his throne some delegated power,\r\n  Who, studious of our peace, dost turn the thought\r\n  From vain and vile, to solid and sublime!\r\n  Unseen thou lead'st me to delicious draughts\r\n  Of inspiration, from a purer stream,\r\n  And fuller of the god, than that which burst\r\n  From famed Castalia: nor is yet allay'd\r\n  My sacred thirst; though long my soul has ranged                   110\r\n  Through pleasing paths of moral, and divine,\r\n  By Thee sustain'd, and lighted by the stars.\r\n    By them best lighted are the paths of thought:\r\n  Nights are their days, their most illumined hours.\r\n  By day, the soul, o'erborne by life's career,\r\n  Stunn'd by the din, and giddy with the glare,\r\n  Reels far from reason, jostled by the throng.\r\n  By day the soul is passive, all her thoughts\r\n  Imposed, precarious, broken ere mature.\r\n  By night, from objects free, from passion cool,                    120\r\n  Thoughts uncontroll'd, and unimpress'd, the births\r\n  Of pure election, arbitrary range,\r\n  Not to the limits of one world confined;                           123\r\n  But from ethereal travels light on earth,\r\n  As voyagers drop anchor, for repose.\r\n    Let Indians, and the gay, like Indians, fond\r\n  Of feather'd fopperies, the sun adore:\r\n  Darkness has more divinity for me;\r\n  It strikes thought inward; it drives back the soul\r\n  To settle on herself, our point supreme!                           130\r\n  There lies our theatre; there sits our judge.\r\n  Darkness the curtain drops o'er life's dull scene;\r\n  'Tis the kind hand of Providence stretch'd out\r\n  'Twixt man and vanity; 'tis reason's reign,\r\n  And virtue's too; these tutelary shades\r\n  Are man's asylum from the tainted throng.\r\n  Night is the good man's friend, and guardian too;\r\n  It no less rescues virtue, than inspires.\r\n    Virtue, for ever frail, as fair, below,\r\n  Her tender nature suffers in the crowd,                            140\r\n  Nor touches on the world, without a stain:\r\n  The world's infectious; few bring back at eve.\r\n  Immaculate, the manners of the morn.\r\n  Something we thought, is blotted; we resolved,\r\n  Is shaken; we renounced, returns again.\r\n  Each salutation may slide in a sin\r\n  Unthought before, or fix a former flaw.\r\n  Nor is it strange: light, motion, concourse, noise,\r\n  All, scatter us abroad; thought outward-bound,\r\n  Neglectful of our home affairs, flies off                          150\r\n  In fume and dissipation, quits her charge,\r\n  And leaves the breast unguarded to the foe.\r\n    Present example gets within our guard,\r\n  And acts with double force, by few repell'd.\r\n  Ambition fires ambition; love of gain\r\n  Strikes, like a pestilence, from breast to breast;\r\n  Riot, pride, perfidy, blue vapours breathe;                        157\r\n  And inhumanity is caught from man,\r\n  From smiling man. A slight, a single glance,\r\n  And shot at random, often has brought home\r\n  A sudden fever, to the throbbing heart,\r\n  Of envy, rancour, or impure desire.\r\n  We see, we hear, with peril; safety dwells                         163\r\n  Remote from multitude; the world's a school\r\n  Of wrong, and what proficients swarm around!\r\n  We must, or imitate, or disapprove;\r\n  Must list as their accomplices, or foes;\r\n  That stains our innocence; this wounds our peace.\r\n  From nature's birth, hence, wisdom has been smit\r\n  With sweet recess, and languish'd for the shade.                   170\r\n    This sacred shade, and solitude, what is it?\r\n  'Tis the felt presence of the Deity.\r\n  Few are the faults we flatter when alone.\r\n  Vice sinks in her allurements, is ungilt,\r\n  And looks, like other objects, black by night.\r\n  By night an atheist half believes a God.\r\n    Night is fair virtue's immemorial friend;\r\n  The conscious moon, through every distant age,\r\n  Has held a lamp to wisdom, and let fall,\r\n  On contemplation's eye, her purging ray.                           180\r\n  The famed Athenian,[17] he who woo'd from heaven\r\n  Philosophy the fair, to dwell with men,\r\n  And form their manners, not inflame their pride,\r\n  While o'er his head, as fearful to molest\r\n  His labouring mind, the stars in silence slide,\r\n  And seem all gazing on their future guest,\r\n  See him soliciting his ardent suit\r\n  In private audience: all the live-long night,\r\n  Rigid in thought, and motionless, he stands;\r\n  Nor quits his theme, or posture, till the sun                      190\r\n  (Rude drunkard rising rosy from the main!)\r\n  Disturbs his nobler intellectual beam,\r\n  And gives him to the tumult of the world.\r\n  Hail, precious moments! stolen from the black waste\r\n  Of murder'd time! Auspicious midnight! hail!\r\n  The world excluded, every passion hush'd,\r\n  And open'd a calm intercourse with Heaven,\r\n  Here the soul sits in council; ponders past,\r\n  Predestines future, action; sees, not feels,\r\n  Tumultuous life, and reasons with the storm;                       200\r\n  All her lies answers, and thinks down her charms.\r\n    What awful joy! what mental liberty!\r\n  I am not pent in darkness; rather say\r\n  (If not too bold) in darkness I'm embower'd.\r\n  Delightful gloom! the clustering thoughts around\r\n  Spontaneous rise, and blossom in the shade;\r\n  But droop by day, and sicken in the sun.\r\n  Thought borrows light elsewhere; from that first fire,\r\n  Fountain of animation! whence descends\r\n  Urania, my celestial guest! who deigns                             210\r\n  Nightly to visit me, so mean; and now,\r\n  Conscious how needful discipline to man,\r\n  From pleasing dalliance with the charms of Night\r\n  My wandering thought recalls, to what excites\r\n  Far other beat of heart! Narcissa's tomb!\r\n  Or is it feeble nature calls me back,\r\n  And breaks my spirit into grief again?\r\n  Is it a Stygian vapour in my blood?\r\n  A cold, slow puddle, creeping through my veins?\r\n  Or is it thus with all men?--Thus with all.                        220\r\n  What are we? how unequal! Now we soar,\r\n  And now we sink; to be the same, transcends\r\n  Our present prowess. Dearly pays the soul\r\n  For lodging ill; too dearly rents her clay.                        224\r\n  Reason, a baffled counsellor! but adds\r\n  The blush of weakness to the bane of woe.\r\n  The noblest spirit fighting her hard fate,\r\n  In this damp, dusky region, charged with storms,\r\n  But feebly flutters, yet untaught to fly;\r\n  Or, flying, short her flight, and sure her fall.\r\n  Our utmost strength, when down, to rise again;\r\n  And not to yield, though beaten, all our praise.                   232\r\n    'Tis vain to seek in men for more than man.\r\n  Though proud in promise, big in previous thought,\r\n  Experience damps our triumph. I, who late,\r\n  Emerging from the shadows of the grave,\r\n  Where grief detain'd me prisoner, mounting high,\r\n  Threw wide the gates of everlasting day,\r\n  And call'd mankind to glory, shook off pain,\r\n  Mortality shook off, in ether pure,                                240\r\n  And struck the stars; now feel my spirits fail;\r\n  They drop me from the zenith; down I rush,\r\n  Like him whom fable fledged[18] with waxen wings,\r\n  In sorrow drown'd--but not in sorrow lost.\r\n  How wretched is the man who never mourn'd!\r\n  I dive for precious pearl in sorrow's stream:\r\n  Not so the thoughtless man that only grieves;\r\n  Takes all the torment, and rejects the gain;\r\n  (Inestimable gain!) and gives Heaven leave\r\n  To make him but more wretched, not more wise.                      250\r\n    If wisdom is our lesson (and what else\r\n  Ennobles man? what else have angels learn'd?),\r\n  Grief! more proficients in thy school are made,\r\n  Than genius, or proud learning, e'er could boast.\r\n  Voracious learning, often over-fed,\r\n  Digests not into sense her motley meal.\r\n  This book-case, which dark booty almost burst,                     257\r\n  This forager on others' wisdom, leaves\r\n  Her native farm, her reason, quite untill'd.\r\n  With mix'd manure she surfeits the rank soil,\r\n  Dung'd, but not dress'd; and rich to beggary.\r\n  A pomp untameable of weeds prevails.\r\n  Her servant's wealth, encumber'd wisdom mourns.                    263\r\n    And what says Genius? \"Let the dull be wise.\"\r\n  Genius, too hard for right, can prove it wrong;\r\n  And loves to boast, where blush men less inspired.\r\n  It pleads exemption from the laws of sense;\r\n  Considers reason as a leveller;\r\n  And scorns to share a blessing with the crowd.\r\n  That wise it could be, thinks an ample claim                       270\r\n  To glory, and to pleasure gives the rest.\r\n  Crassus but sleeps, Ardelio is undone.\r\n  Wisdom less shudders at a fool, than wit.\r\n    But Wisdom smiles, when humbled mortals weep.\r\n  When sorrow wounds the breast, as ploughs the glebe,[19]\r\n  And hearts obdurate feel her softening shower;\r\n  Her seed celestial, then, glad wisdom sows;\r\n  Her golden harvest triumphs in the soil.\r\n  If so, Narcissa[20], welcome my Relapse;\r\n  I'll raise a tax on my calamity,                                   280\r\n  And reap rich compensation from my pain.\r\n  I'll range the plenteous intellectual field;\r\n  And gather every thought of sovereign power\r\n  To chase the moral maladies of man;\r\n  Thoughts, which may bear transplanting to the skies,\r\n  Though natives of this coarse penurious soil;\r\n  Nor wholly wither there, where seraphs sing,\r\n  Refined, exalted, not annull'd, in heaven.\r\n  Reason, the sun that gives them birth, the same\r\n  In either clime, though more illustrious there.                    290\r\n  These choicely cull'd, and elegantly ranged,                       291\r\n  Shall form a garland for Narcissa's tomb;\r\n  And, peradventure, of no fading flowers.\r\n    Say on what themes shall puzzled choice descend?\r\n  \"Th' importance of contemplating the tomb;\r\n  Why men decline it; suicide's foul birth;\r\n  The various kind of grief; the faults of age;\r\n  And Death's dread character--invite my song.\"\r\n    And, first th' importance of our end survey'd.\r\n  Friends counsel quick dismission of our grief:                     300\r\n  Mistaken kindness! our hearts heal too soon.\r\n  Are they more kind than He, who struck the blow?\r\n  Who bid it do his errand in our hearts,\r\n  And banish peace, till nobler guests arrive,\r\n  And bring it back, a true and endless peace?\r\n  Calamities are friends: as glaring day\r\n  Of these unnumber'd lustres robs our sight;\r\n  Prosperity puts out unnumber'd thoughts\r\n  Of import high, and light divine, to man.\r\n    The man how blest, who, sick of gaudy scenes,                    310\r\n  (Scenes apt to thrust between us and ourselves!)\r\n  Is led by choice to take his favourite walk,\r\n  Beneath death's gloomy, silent, cypress shades,\r\n  Unpierced by vanity's fantastic ray;\r\n  To read his monuments, to weigh his dust,\r\n  Visit his vaults, and dwell among the tombs!\r\n  Lorenzo[21] read with me Narcissa's stone;\r\n  (Narcissa was thy favourite) let us read\r\n  Her moral stone; few doctors preach so well;\r\n  Few orators so tenderly can touch                                  320\r\n  The feeling heart. What pathos in the date!\r\n  Apt words can strike: and yet in them we see\r\n  Faint images of what we here enjoy.\r\n  What cause have we to build on length of life?\r\n  Temptations seize, when fear is laid asleep;                       325\r\n  And ill foreboded is our strongest guard.\r\n    See from her tomb, as from an humble shrine,\r\n  Truth, radiant goddess! sallies on my soul,\r\n  And puts delusion's dusky train to flight;\r\n  Dispels the mists our sultry passions raise,\r\n  From objects low, terrestrial, and obscene;\r\n  And shows the real estimate of things;                             332\r\n  Which no man, unafflicted, ever saw;\r\n  Pulls off the veil from virtue's rising charms;\r\n  Detects temptation in a thousand lies.\r\n  Truth bids me look on men, as autumn leaves,\r\n  And all they bleed for, as the summer's dust,\r\n  Driven by the whirlwind: lighted by her beams,\r\n  I widen my horizon, gain new powers,\r\n  See things invisible, feel things remote,                          340\r\n  Am present with futurities; think nought\r\n  To man so foreign, as the joys possess'd;\r\n  Nought so much his, as those beyond the grave.\r\n    No folly keeps its colour in her sight;\r\n  Pale worldly wisdom loses all her charms;\r\n  In pompous promise, from her schemes profound,\r\n  If future fate she plans, 'tis all in leaves,\r\n  Like Sibyl, unsubstantial, fleeting bliss!\r\n  At the first blast it vanishes in air.\r\n  Not so, celestial: would'st thou know, Lorenzo!                    350\r\n  How differ worldly wisdom, and divine?\r\n  Just as the waning and the waxing moon.\r\n  More empty worldly wisdom every day;\r\n  And every day more fair her rival shines.\r\n  When later, there's less time to play the fool.\r\n  Soon our whole term for wisdom is expired\r\n  (Thou know'st she calls no council in the grave):\r\n  And everlasting fool is writ in fire,                              358\r\n  Or real wisdom wafts us to the skies.\r\n    As worldly schemes resemble Sibyl's leaves,\r\n  The good man's days to Sibyl's books compare,\r\n  (In ancient story read, thou know'st the tale),\r\n  In price still rising, as in number less,\r\n  Inestimable quite his final hour.                                  364\r\n  For that who thrones can offer, offer thrones;\r\n  Insolvent worlds the purchase cannot pay.\r\n  \"O let me die his death!\" all nature cries.\r\n  \"Then live his life\"--all nature falters there;\r\n  Our great physician daily to consult,\r\n  To commune with the grave, our only cure.                          370\r\n    What grave prescribes the best?--A friend's; and yet,\r\n  From a friend's grave, how soon we disengage!\r\n  Even to the dearest, as his marble, cold.\r\n  Why are friends ravish'd from us?

What the cause,                         390\r\n  The wondrous cause, of this mysterious ill?                        391\r\n  All heaven looks down astonish'd at the sight.\r\n    Is it, that life has sown her joys so thick,\r\n  We can't thrust in a single care between?\r\n  Is it, that life has such a swarm of cares,\r\n  The thought of death can't enter for the throng?\r\n  Is it, that time steals on with downy feet,\r\n  Nor wakes indulgence from her golden dream?\r\n  To-day is so like yesterday, it cheats;\r\n  We take the lying sister for the same.                             400\r\n  Life glides away, Lorenzo, like a brook;\r\n  For ever changing, unperceived the change.\r\n  In the same brook none ever bathed him twice:\r\n  To the same life none ever twice awoke.\r\n  We call the brook the same; the same we think\r\n  Our life, though still more rapid in its flow;\r\n  Nor mark the much, irrevocably lapsed,\r\n  And mingled with the sea. Or shall we say\r\n  (Retaining still the brook to bear us on)\r\n  That life is like a vessel on the stream?                          410\r\n  In life embark'd, we smoothly down the tide\r\n  Of time descend, but not on time intent;\r\n  Amused, unconscious of the gliding wave;\r\n  Till on a sudden we perceive a shock;\r\n  We start, awake, look out; what see we there?\r\n  Our brittle bark is burst on Charon's shore.\r\n    Is this the cause death flies all human thought?\r\n  Or is it judgment, by the will struck blind,\r\n  That domineering mistress of the soul!\r\n  Like him so strong, by Dalilah the fair?                           420\r\n  Or is it fear turns startled reason back,\r\n  From looking down a precipice so steep?\r\n  'Tis dreadful; and the dread is wisely placed,\r\n  By nature, conscious of the make of man.\r\n  A dreadful friend it is, a terror kind,                            425\r\n  A flaming sword to guard the tree of life.\r\n  By that unawed, in life's most smiling hour,\r\n  The good man would repine; would suffer joys,\r\n  And burn impatient for his promised skies.\r\n  The bad, on each punctilious pique of pride,\r\n  Or gloom of humour, would give rage the rein;\r\n  Bound o'er the barrier, rush into the dark,                        432\r\n  And mar the schemes of Providence below.\r\n    What groan was that, Lorenzo?--Furies! rise,\r\n  And drown in your less execrable yell\r\n  Britannia's shame. There took her gloomy flight,\r\n  On wing impetuous, a black sullen soul,\r\n  Blasted from hell, with horrid lust of death;\r\n  Thy friend, the brave, the gallant Altamont,\r\n  So call'd, so thought--and then he fled the field.                 440\r\n  Less base the fear of death, than fear of life.\r\n  O Britain, infamous for suicide!\r\n  An island in thy manners! far disjoin'd\r\n  From the whole world of rationals beside!\r\n  In ambient waves plunge thy polluted head,\r\n  Wash the dire stain, nor shock the Continent.\r\n    But thou be shock'd, while I detect the cause\r\n  Of self-assault, expose the monster's birth,\r\n  And bid abhorrence hiss it round the world.\r\n  Blame not thy clime, nor chide the distant sun;                    450\r\n  The sun is innocent, thy clime absolved:\r\n  Immoral climes kind nature never made.\r\n  The cause I sing, in Eden might prevail,\r\n  And proves, it is thy folly, not thy fate.\r\n    The soul of man (let man in homage bow,\r\n  Who names his soul), a native of the skies!\r\n  High-born, and free, her freedom should maintain,\r\n  Unsold, unmortgaged for earth's little bribes.\r\n  Th' illustrious stranger, in this foreign land,                    459\r\n  Like strangers, jealous of her dignity,\r\n  Studious of home, and ardent to return,\r\n  Of earth suspicious, earth's enchanted cup\r\n  With cool reserve light touching, should indulge\r\n  On immortality her godlike taste;\r\n  There take large draughts, make her chief banquet there.\r\n    But some reject this sustenance divine;\r\n  To beggarly vile appetites descend;\r\n  Ask alms of earth, for guests that came from heaven!\r\n  Sink into slaves; and sell, for present hire,\r\n  Their rich reversion, and (what shares its fate)                   470\r\n  Their native freedom, to the prince who sways\r\n  This nether world. And when his payments fail,\r\n  When his foul basket gorges them no more,\r\n  Or their pall'd palates loathe the basket full;\r\n  Are instantly, with wild demoniac rage,\r\n  For breaking all the chains of Providence,\r\n  And bursting their confinement; though fast barr'd\r\n  By laws divine and human; guarded strong\r\n  With horrors doubled to defend the pass,\r\n  The blackest, nature, or dire guilt, can raise;                    480\r\n  And moated round with fathomless destruction,\r\n  Sure to receive, and whelm them in their fall.\r\n    Such, Britons! is the cause, to you unknown,\r\n  Or worse, o'erlook'd; o'erlook'd by magistrates,\r\n  Thus criminals themselves. I grant the deed\r\n  Is madness, but the madness of the heart.\r\n  And what is that? Our utmost bound of guilt.\r\n  A sensual, unreflecting life, is big\r\n  With monstrous births, and suicide, to crown\r\n  The black infernal brood. The bold to break                        490\r\n  Heaven's law supreme, and desperately rush,\r\n  Through sacred Nature's murder, on their own,\r\n  Because they never think of death, they die.                       493\r\n  'Tis equally man's duty, glory, gain,\r\n  At once to shun, and meditate, his end.\r\n  When by the bed of languishment we sit\r\n  (The seat of wisdom! if our choice, not fate),\r\n  Or, o'er our dying friends, in anguish hang,\r\n  Wipe the cold dew, or stay the sinking head,\r\n  Number their moments, and, in every clock,                         500\r\n  Start at the voice of an eternity;\r\n  See the dim lamp of life just feebly lift\r\n  An agonizing beam, at us to gaze,\r\n  Then sink again, and quiver into death,\r\n  That most pathetic herald of our own;\r\n  How read we such sad scenes? As sent to man\r\n  In perfect vengeance? No; in pity sent,\r\n  To melt him down, like wax, and then impress,\r\n  Indelible, Death's image on his heart;\r\n  Bleeding for others, trembling for himself.                        510\r\n  We bleed, we tremble, we forget, we smile.\r\n  The mind turns fool, before the cheek is dry.\r\n  Our quick-returning folly cancels all;\r\n  As the tide rushing razes what is writ\r\n  In yielding sands, and smooths the letter'd shore.\r\n    Lorenzo! hast thou ever weigh'd a sigh?\r\n  Or studied the philosophy of tears?\r\n  (A science, yet unlectured in our schools!)\r\n  Hast thou descended deep into the breast,\r\n  And seen their source? If not, descend with me,                    520\r\n  And trace these briny rivulets to their springs.\r\n    Our funeral tears from different causes rise,\r\n  As if from separate cisterns in the soul,\r\n  Of various kinds, they flow. From tender hearts,\r\n  By soft contagion call'd, some burst at once,\r\n  And stream obsequious to the leading eye.\r\n  Some ask more time, by curious art distill'd.                      527\r\n  Some hearts, in secret hard, unapt to melt,\r\n  Struck by the magic of the public eye,\r\n  Like Moses' smitten rock, gush out amain.\r\n  Some weep to share the fame of the deceased,\r\n  So high in merit, and to them so dear.\r\n  They dwell on praises, which they think they share;                533\r\n  And thus, without a blush, commend themselves.\r\n  Some mourn, in proof that something they could love:\r\n  They weep not to relieve their grief, but show.\r\n  Some weep in perfect justice to the dead,\r\n  As conscious all their love is in arrear.\r\n  Some mischievously weep, not unapprised\r\n  Tears, sometimes, aid the conquest of an eye.                      540\r\n  With what address the soft Ephesians draw\r\n  Their sable network o'er entangled hearts!\r\n  As seen through crystal, how their roses glow,\r\n  While liquid pearl runs trickling down their cheek!\r\n  Of hers not prouder Egypt's wanton queen,\r\n  Carousing gems, herself dissolved in love.\r\n  Some weep at death, abstracted from the dead,\r\n  And celebrate, like Charles,[22] their own decease.\r\n  By kind construction some are deem'd to weep,\r\n  Because a decent veil conceals their joy.                          550\r\n    Some weep in earnest, and yet weep in vain;\r\n  As deep in indiscretion, as in woe.\r\n  Passion, blind Passion! impotently pours\r\n  Tears, that deserve more tears; while Reason sleeps;\r\n  Or gazes like an idiot, unconcern'd;\r\n  Nor comprehends the meaning of the storm;\r\n  Knows not it speaks to her, and her alone.\r\n  Irrationals all sorrow are beneath,\r\n  That noble gift! that privilege of man!\r\n  From sorrow's pang, the birth of endless joy.                      560\r\n  But these are barren of that birth divine:\r\n  They weep impetuous, as the summer storm,\r\n  And full as short! The cruel grief soon tamed,\r\n  They make a pastime of the stingless tale;\r\n  Far as the deep resounding knell, they spread\r\n  The dreadful news, and hardly feel it more.\r\n  No grain of wisdom pays them for their woe.\r\n    Half-round the globe, the tears pump'd up by Death\r\n  Are spent in watering vanities of life;\r\n  In making folly flourish still more fair,                          570\r\n  When the sick soul, her wonted stay withdrawn,\r\n  Reclines on earth, and sorrows in the dust;\r\n  Instead of learning, there, her true support,\r\n  Though there thrown down her true support to learn.\r\n  Without Heaven's aid, impatient to be bless'd,\r\n  She crawls to the next shrub, or bramble vile,\r\n  Though from the stately cedar's arms she fell;\r\n  With stale, forsworn embraces, clings anew,\r\n  The stranger weds, and blossoms, as before,\r\n  In all the fruitless fopperies of life:                            580\r\n  Presents her weed, well-fancied, at the ball,\r\n  And raffles for the Death's-head on the ring.\r\n    So wept Aurelia, till the destined youth\r\n  Stepp'd in, with his receipt for making smiles,\r\n  And blanching sables into bridal bloom.\r\n  So wept Lorenzo fair Clarissa's fate;\r\n  Who gave that angel boy, on whom he doats;\r\n  And died to give him, orphan'd in his birth!\r\n  Not such, Narcissa, my distress for thee.\r\n  I'll make an altar of thy sacred tomb,                             590\r\n  To sacrifice to wisdom.--What wast thou?\r\n  \"Young, gay, and fortunate!\" Each yields a theme.\r\n  I'll dwell on each, to shun thought more severe;\r\n  (Heaven knows I labour with severer still!)                        594\r\n  I'll dwell on each, and quite exhaust thy death.\r\n  A soul without reflection, like a pile\r\n  Without inhabitant, to ruin runs.\r\n    And, first, thy youth. What says it to grey hairs?\r\n  Narcissa, I'm become thy pupil now--\r\n  Early, bright, transient, chaste, as morning dew,\r\n  She sparkled, was exhaled, and went to heaven.\r\n  Time on this head has snow'd; yet still 'tis borne                 602\r\n  Aloft; nor thinks but on another's grave.\r\n  Cover'd with shame I speak it, age severe\r\n  Old worn-out vice sets down for virtue fair;\r\n  With graceless gravity, chastising youth,\r\n  That youth chastised surpassing in a fault,\r\n  Father of all, forgetfulness of death:\r\n  As if, like objects pressing on the sight,\r\n  Death had advanced too near us to be seen:                         610\r\n  Or, that life's loan Time ripen'd into right;\r\n  And men might plead prescription from the grave;\r\n  Deathless, from repetition of reprieve.\r\n  Deathless? far from it! such are dead already;\r\n  Their hearts are buried, and the world their grave.\r\n    Tell me, some god! my guardian angel! tell,\r\n  What thus infatuates? what enchantment plants\r\n  The phantom of an age 'twixt us, and Death\r\n  Already at the door? He knocks, we hear,\r\n  And yet we will not hear. What mail defends                        620\r\n  Our untouch'd hearts? what miracle turns off\r\n  The pointed thought, which from a thousand quivers\r\n  Is daily darted, and is daily shunn'd?\r\n  We stand, as in a battle, throngs on throngs\r\n  Around us falling; wounded oft ourselves;\r\n  Though bleeding with our wounds, immortal still!\r\n  We see Time's furrows on another's brow,\r\n  And Death intrench'd, preparing his assault;                       628\r\n  How few themselves, in that just mirror, see,\r\n  Or, seeing, draw their inference as strong!\r\n  There, death is certain; doubtful here: he must,\r\n  And soon; we may, within an age, expire.\r\n  Though grey our heads, our thoughts and aims are green;\r\n  Like damaged clocks, whose hand and bell dissent;\r\n  Folly sings six, while Nature points at twelve.\r\n    Absurd longevity! More, more! it cries:\r\n  More life, more wealth, more trash of every kind.\r\n  And wherefore mad for more, when relish fails?\r\n  Object, and appetite, must club for joy;\r\n  Shall Folly labour hard to mend the bow,                           640\r\n  Baubles, I mean, that strike us from without,\r\n  While Nature is relaxing every string?\r\n  Ask thought for joy; grow rich, and hoard within.\r\n  Think you the soul, when this life's rattles cease,\r\n  Has nothing of more manly to succeed?\r\n  Contract the taste immortal; learn even now\r\n  To relish what alone subsists hereafter.\r\n  Divine, or none, henceforth your joys for ever.\r\n  Of age the glory is, to wish to die.\r\n  That wish is praise, and promise; it applauds                      650\r\n  Past life, and promises our future bliss.\r\n  What weakness see not children in their sires?\r\n  Grand-climacterical absurdities!\r\n  Grey-hair'd authority, to faults of youth,\r\n  How shocking! it makes folly thrice a fool;\r\n  And our first childhood might our last despise.\r\n  Peace and esteem is all that age can hope.\r\n  Nothing but wisdom gives the first; the last,\r\n  Nothing, but the repute of being wise.\r\n  Folly bars both; our age is quite undone.                          660\r\n    What folly can be ranker? Like our shadows,\r\n  Our wishes lengthen, as our sun declines.                          662\r\n  No wish should loiter, then, this side the grave.\r\n  Our hearts should leave the world, before the knell\r\n  Calls for our carcases to mend the soil.\r\n  Enough to live in tempest, die in port;\r\n  Age should fly concourse, cover in retreat\r\n  Defects of judgment; and the will subdue;\r\n  Walk thoughtful on the silent, solemn shore\r\n  Of that vast ocean it must sail so soon;                           670\r\n  And put good works on board; and wait the wind\r\n  That shortly blows us into worlds unknown:\r\n  If unconsider'd too, a dreadful scene!\r\n    All should be prophets to themselves; foresee\r\n  Their future fate; their future fate foretaste;\r\n  This art would waste the bitterness of death.\r\n  The thought of death alone, the fear destroys.\r\n  A disaffection to that precious thought\r\n  Is more than midnight darkness on the soul,\r\n  Which sleeps beneath it, on a precipice,                           680\r\n  Puff'd off by the first blast, and lost for ever.\r\n    Dost ask, Lorenzo, why so warmly press'd,\r\n  By repetition hammer'd on thine ear,\r\n  The thought of death? That thought is the machine,\r\n  The grand machine, that heaves us from the dust,\r\n  And rears us into men. That thought, plied home,\r\n  Will soon reduce the ghastly precipice\r\n  O'er-hanging hell, will soften the descent,\r\n  And gently slope our passage to the grave;\r\n  How warmly to be wish'd! What heart of flesh                       690\r\n  Would trifle with tremendous? dare extremes?\r\n  Yawn o'er the fate of infinite? What hand,\r\n  Beyond the blackest brand of censure bold,\r\n  (To speak a language too well known to thee),\r\n  Would at a moment give its all to chance,                          695\r\n  And stamp the die for an eternity?\r\n    Aid me, Narcissa! aid me to keep pace\r\n  With Destiny; and ere her scissors cut\r\n  My thread of life, to break this tougher thread\r\n  Of moral death, that ties me to the world.\r\n  Sting thou my slumbering reason to send forth\r\n  A thought of observation on the foe;                               702\r\n  To sally; and survey the rapid march\r\n  Of his ten thousand messengers to man;\r\n  Who, Jehu-like, behind him turns them all.\r\n  All accident apart, by Nature sign'd,\r\n  My warrant is gone out, though dormant yet;\r\n  Perhaps behind one moment lurks my fate.\r\n    Must I then forward only look for Death?\r\n  Backward I turn mine eye, and find him there.                      710\r\n  Man is a self-survivor every year.\r\n  Man, like a stream, is in perpetual flow.\r\n  Death's a destroyer of quotidian[23] prey.\r\n  My youth, my noontide, his; my yesterday;\r\n  The bold invader shares the present hour.\r\n  Each moment on the former shuts the grave.\r\n  While man is growing, life is in decrease;\r\n  And cradles rock us nearer to the tomb.\r\n  Our birth is nothing but our death begun;\r\n  As tapers waste, that instant they take fire.                      720\r\n    Shall we then fear, lest that should come to pass,\r\n  Which comes to pass each moment of our lives?\r\n  If fear we must, let that Death turn us pale,\r\n  Which murders strength and ardour; what remains\r\n  Should rather call on Death, than dread his call.\r\n  Ye partners of my fault, and my decline!\r\n  Thoughtless of death, but when your neighbour's knell\r\n  (Rude visitant!) knocks hard at your dull sense,\r\n  And with its thunder scarce obtains your ear!                      729\r\n  Be death your theme, in every place and hour;\r\n  Nor longer want, ye monumental sires!\r\n  A brother tomb to tell you ye shall die.\r\n  That death you dread (so great is Nature's skill)\r\n  Know, you shall court before you shall enjoy.\r\n    But you are learn'd; in volumes deep, you sit;\r\n  In wisdom, shallow: pompous ignorance!\r\n  Would you be still more learned than the learn'd?\r\n  Learn well to know how much need not be known,\r\n  And what that knowledge, which impairs your sense.\r\n  Our needful knowledge, like our needful food,                      740\r\n  Unhedged, lies open in life's common field;\r\n  And bids all welcome to the vital feast.\r\n  You scorn what lies before you in the page\r\n  Of Nature, and Experience, moral truth;\r\n  Of indispensable, eternal fruit;\r\n  Fruit, on which mortals feeding, turn to gods:\r\n  And dive in science for distinguish'd names,\r\n  Dishonest fomentation of your pride!\r\n  Sinking in virtue, as you rise in fame.\r\n  Your learning, like the lunar beam, affords                        750\r\n  Light, but not heat; it leaves you indevout,\r\n  Frozen at heart, while speculation shines.\r\n  Awake, ye curious indagators! fond\r\n  Of knowing all, but what avails you known.\r\n  If you would learn Death's character, attend.\r\n  All casts of conduct, all degrees of health,\r\n  All dies of fortune, and all dates of age,\r\n  Together shook in his impartial urn,\r\n  Come forth at random: or, if choice is made,\r\n  The choice is quite sarcastic, and insults                         760\r\n  All bold conjecture, and fond hopes of man.\r\n  What countless multitudes not only leave,\r\n  But deeply disappoint us, by their deaths!                         763\r\n  Though great our sorrow, greater our surprise.\r\n    Like other tyrants, Death delights to smite,\r\n  What, smitten, most proclaims the pride of power,\r\n  And arbitrary nod. His joy supreme,\r\n  To bid the wretch survive the fortunate;\r\n  The feeble wrap th' athletic in his shroud;\r\n  And weeping fathers build their children's tomb:                   770\r\n  Me thine, Narcissa!--What though short thy date?\r\n  Virtue, not rolling suns, the mind matures.\r\n  That life is long, which answers life's great end.\r\n  The time that bears no fruit, deserves no name;\r\n  The man of wisdom is the man of years.\r\n  In hoary youth Methusalems may die;\r\n  O how misdated on their flattering tombs!\r\n    Narcissa's youth has lectured me thus far.\r\n  And can her gaiety give counsel too?\r\n  That, like the Jews' famed oracle of gems,[24]                     780\r\n  Sparkles instruction; such as throws new light,\r\n  And opens more the character of Death;\r\n  Ill known to thee, Lorenzo! This thy vaunt:\r\n  \"Give Death his due, the wretched, and the old;\r\n  Even let him sweep his rubbish to the grave;\r\n  Let him not violate kind Nature's laws,\r\n  But own man born to live as well as die.\"\r\n  Wretched and old thou givest him; young and gay\r\n  He takes; and plunder is a tyrant's joy.\r\n  What if I prove, \"The farthest from the fear,                      790\r\n  Are often nearest to the stroke of Fate?\"\r\n    All, more than common, menaces an end.\r\n  A blaze betokens brevity of life:\r\n  As if bright embers should emit a flame,\r\n  Glad spirits sparkled from Narcissa's eye,\r\n  And made youth younger, and taught life to live,                   796\r\n  As Nature's opposites wage endless war,\r\n  For this offence, as treason to the deep\r\n  Inviolable stupor of his reign,\r\n  Where Lust, and turbulent Ambition, sleep,\r\n  Death took swift vengeance. As he life detests,\r\n  More life is still more odious; and, reduced\r\n  By conquest, aggrandizes more his power.                           803\r\n  But wherefore aggrandized? By Heaven's decree,\r\n  To plant the soul on her eternal guard,\r\n  In awful expectation of our end.\r\n  Thus runs Death's dread commission: \"Strike, but so\r\n  As most alarms the living by the dead.\"\r\n  Hence stratagem delights him, and surprise,\r\n  And cruel sport with man's securities.                             810\r\n  Not simple conquest, triumph is his aim;\r\n  And, where least fear'd, there conquest triumphs most.\r\n  This proves my bold assertion not too bold.\r\n    What are his arts to lay our fears asleep?\r\n  Tiberian arts his purposes wrap up\r\n  In deep dissimulation's darkest night.\r\n  Like princes unconfess'd in foreign courts,\r\n  Who travel under cover, Death assumes\r\n  The name and look of life, and dwells among us.\r\n  He takes all shapes that serve his black designs:                  820\r\n  Though master of a wider empire far\r\n  Than that o'er which the Roman eagle flew.\r\n  Like Nero, he's a fiddler, charioteer,\r\n  Or drives his phaeton, in female guise;\r\n  Quite unsuspected, till, the wheel beneath,\r\n  His disarray'd oblation he devours.\r\n    He most affects the forms least like himself,\r\n  His slender self. Hence burly corpulence\r\n  Is his familiar wear, and sleek disguise.\r\n  Behind the rosy bloom he loves to lurk,                            830\r\n  Or ambush in a smile; or wanton dive\r\n  In dimples deep; love's eddies, which draw in\r\n  Unwary hearts, and sink them in despair.\r\n  Such, on Narcissa's couch he loiter'd long\r\n  Unknown; and, when detected, still was seen\r\n  To smile; such peace has innocence in death!\r\n  Most happy they! whom least his arts deceive.\r\n  One eye on Death, and one full fix'd on heaven,\r\n  Becomes a mortal, and immortal man.\r\n  Long on his wiles a piqued and jealous spy,                        840\r\n  I've seen, or dreamt I saw, the tyrant dress;\r\n  Lay by his horrors, and put on his smiles.\r\n  Say, Muse, for thou remember'st, call it back,\r\n  And show Lorenzo the surprising scene;\r\n  If 'twas a dream, his genius can explain.\r\n    'Twas in a circle of the gay I stood.\r\n  Death would have enter'd; Nature push'd him back;\r\n  Supported by a doctor of renown,\r\n  His point he gain'd. Then artfully dismiss'd\r\n  The sage; for Death design'd to be conceal'd.                      850\r\n  He gave an old vivacious usurer\r\n  His meagre aspect, and his naked bones;\r\n  In gratitude for plumping up his prey,\r\n  A pamper'd spendthrift; whose fantastic air,\r\n  Well-fashion'd figure, and cockaded[25] brow,\r\n  He took in change, and underneath the pride\r\n  Of costly linen, tuck'd his filthy shroud.\r\n  His crooked bow he straighten'd to a cane;\r\n  And hid his deadly shafts in Myra's eye.\r\n    The dreadful masquerader, thus equipp'd,                         860\r\n  Out sallies on adventures. Ask you where?\r\n  Where is he not? For his peculiar haunts,\r\n  Let this suffice; sure as night follows day,\r\n  Death treads in pleasure's footsteps round the world,              864\r\n  When pleasure treads the paths, which reason shuns.\r\n  When, against reason, riot shuts the door,\r\n  And gaiety supplies the place of sense,\r\n  Then, foremost at the banquet, and the ball,\r\n  Death leads the dance, or stamps the deadly die;\r\n  Nor ever fails the midnight bowl to crown.                         870\r\n  Gaily carousing to his gay compeers,\r\n  Inly he laughs, to see them laugh at him,\r\n  As absent far: and when the revel burns,\r\n  When fear is banish'd, and triumphant thought,\r\n  Calling for all the joys beneath the moon,\r\n  Against him turns the key; and bids him sup\r\n  With their progenitors--He drops his mask;\r\n  Frowns out at full; they start, despair, expire.\r\n    Scarce with more sudden terror and surprise,\r\n  From his black mask of nitre, touch'd by fire,                     880\r\n  He bursts, expands, roars, blazes, and devours.\r\n  And is not this triumphant treachery,\r\n  And more than simple conquest, in the fiend?\r\n    And now, Lorenzo, dost thou wrap thy soul\r\n  In soft security, because unknown\r\n  Which moment is commission'd to destroy?\r\n  In death's uncertainty thy danger lies.\r\n  Is death uncertain? Therefore thou be fix'd;\r\n  Fix'd as a sentinel, all eye, all ear,\r\n  All expectation of the coming foe.                                 890\r\n  Rouse, stand in arms, nor lean against thy spear;\r\n  Lest slumber steal one moment o'er thy soul,\r\n  And Fate surprise thee nodding. Watch, be strong:\r\n  Thus give each day the merit, and renown,\r\n  Of dying well; though doom'd but once to die.\r\n  Nor let life's period hidden (as from most)\r\n  Hide too from thee the precious use of life.\r\n    Early, not sudden, was Narcissa's fate.                          898\r\n  Soon, not surprising, Death his visit paid.\r\n  Her thought went forth to meet him on his way,\r\n  Nor gaiety forgot it was to die:\r\n  Though Fortune too (our third and final theme),\r\n  As an accomplice, play'd her gaudy plumes,\r\n  And every glittering gewgaw, on her sight,                         904\r\n  To dazzle, and debauch it from its mark.\r\n  Death's dreadful advent is the mark of man;\r\n  And every thought that misses it, is blind.\r\n  Fortune, with youth and gaiety, conspired\r\n  To weave a triple wreath of happiness\r\n  (If happiness on earth) to crown her brow.                         910\r\n  And could Death charge through such a shining shield?\r\n    That shining shield invites the tyrant's spear.\r\n  As if to damp our elevated aims,\r\n  And strongly preach humility to man.\r\n  O how portentous is prosperity!\r\n  How, comet-like, it threatens, while it shines!\r\n  Few years but yield us proof of Death's ambition,\r\n  To cull his victims from the fairest fold,\r\n  And sheath his shafts in all the pride of life.\r\n  When flooded with abundance, purpled o'er                          920\r\n  With recent honours, bloom'd with every bliss,\r\n  Set up in ostentation, made the gaze,\r\n  The gaudy centre, of the public eye,\r\n  When Fortune thus has toss'd her child in air,\r\n  Snatch'd from the covert of an humble state,\r\n  How often have I seen him dropp'd at once,\r\n  Our morning's envy! and our evening's sigh!\r\n  As if her bounties were the signal given,\r\n  The flowery wreath to mark the sacrifice,\r\n  And call Death's arrows on the destined prey.                      930\r\n    High Fortune seems in cruel league with Fate.\r\n  Ask you for what? To give his war on man                           932\r\n  The deeper dread, and more illustrious spoil;\r\n  Thus to keep daring mortals more in awe.\r\n  And burns Lorenzo still for the sublime\r\n  Of life? to hang his airy nest on high,\r\n  On the slight timber of the topmost bough,\r\n  Rock'd at each breeze, and menacing a fall?\r\n  Granting grim Death at equal distance there;\r\n  Yet peace begins just where ambition ends.                         940\r\n  What makes man wretched? Happiness denied?\r\n  Lorenzo! no: 'tis happiness disdain'd.\r\n  She comes too meanly dress'd to win our smile;\r\n  And calls herself Content, a homely name!\r\n  Our flame is transport, and Content our scorn.\r\n  Ambition turns, and shuts the door against her,\r\n  And weds a toil, a tempest, in her stead;\r\n  A tempest to warm transport near of kin.\r\n  Unknowing what our mortal state admits,\r\n  Life's modest joys we ruin, while we raise;                        950\r\n  And all our ecstasies are wounds to peace;\r\n  Peace, the full portion of mankind below.\r\n    And since thy peace is dear, ambitious youth!\r\n  Of fortune fond! as thoughtless of thy fate!\r\n  As late I drew Death's picture, to stir up\r\n  Thy wholesome fears; now, drawn in contrast, see\r\n  Gay Fortune's, thy vain hopes to reprimand.\r\n  See, high in air, the sportive goddess hangs,\r\n  Unlocks her casket, spreads her glittering ware,\r\n  And calls the giddy winds to puff abroad                           960\r\n  Her random bounties o'er the gaping throng.\r\n  All rush rapacious; friends o'er trodden friends;\r\n  Sons o'er their fathers, subjects o'er their kings,\r\n  Priests o'er their gods, and lovers o'er the fair\r\n  (Still more adored), to snatch the golden shower.\r\n    Gold glitters most, where virtue shines no more;\r\n  As stars from absent suns have leave to shine.                     967\r\n  O what a precious pack of votaries[26]\r\n  Unkennell'd from the prisons, and the stews,\r\n  Pour in, all opening in their idol's praise;\r\n  All, ardent, eye each wafture of her hand,\r\n  And, wide-expanding their voracious jaws,\r\n  Morsel on morsel swallow down unchew'd,                            973\r\n  Untasted, through mad appetite for more;\r\n  Gorged to the throat, yet lean and ravenous still.\r\n  Sagacious all, to trace the smallest game,\r\n  And bold to seize the greatest. If (bless'd chance!)\r\n  Court-zephyrs sweetly breathe, they launch, they fly,\r\n  O'er just, o'er sacred, all-forbidden ground,\r\n  Drunk with the burning scent of place or power,                    980\r\n  Staunch to the foot of lucre, till they die.\r\n    Or, if for men you take them, as I mark\r\n  Their manners, thou their various fates survey.\r\n  With aim mismeasured, and impetuous speed,\r\n  Some darting, strike their ardent wish far off,\r\n  Through fury to possess it: some succeed,\r\n  But stumble, and let fall the taken prize.\r\n  From some, by sudden blasts, 'tis whirl'd away,\r\n  And lodged in bosoms that ne'er dreamt of gain.\r\n  To some it sticks so close, that, when torn off,                   990\r\n  Torn is the man, and mortal is the wound.\r\n  Some, o'er-enamour'd of their bags, run mad,\r\n  Groan under gold, yet weep for want of bread.\r\n  Together some (unhappy rivals!) seize,\r\n  And rend abundance into poverty;\r\n  Loud croaks the raven of the law, and smiles:\r\n  Smiles too the goddess; but smiles most at those\r\n  (Just victims of exorbitant desire!)\r\n  Who perish at their own request, and, whelm'd\r\n  Beneath her load of lavish grants, expire.                        1000\r\n  Fortune is famous for her numbers slain,\r\n  The number small, which happiness can bear.                       1002\r\n  Though various for a while their fates; at last\r\n  One curse involves them all: at Death's approach,\r\n  All read their riches backward into loss,\r\n  And mourn, in just proportion to their store.\r\n    And Death's approach (if orthodox my song)\r\n  Is hasten'd by the lure of Fortune's smiles.\r\n  And art thou still a glutton of bright gold?\r\n  And art thou still rapacious of thy ruin?                         1010\r\n  Death loves a shining mark, a signal blow;\r\n  A blow, which, while it executes, alarms;\r\n  And startles thousands with a single fall.\r\n  As when some stately growth of oak, or pine,\r\n  Which nods aloft, and proudly spreads her shade,\r\n  The sun's defiance, and the flock's defence;\r\n  By the strong strokes of labouring hinds subdued,\r\n  Loud groans her last, and, rushing from her height,\r\n  In cumbrous ruin, thunders to the ground:\r\n  The conscious forest trembles at the shock,                       1020\r\n  And hill, and stream, and distant dale, resound.\r\n    These high-aim'd darts of Death, and these alone,\r\n  Should I collect, my quiver would be full.\r\n  A quiver, which, suspended in mid-air,\r\n  Or near heaven's archer, in the zodiac, hung,\r\n  (So could it be) should draw the public eye,\r\n  The gaze and contemplation of mankind!\r\n  A constellation awful, yet benign,\r\n  To guide the gay through life's tempestuous wave;\r\n  Nor suffer them to strike the common rock,                        1030\r\n  \"From greater danger to grow more secure,\r\n  And, wrapt in happiness, forget their fate.\"\r\n    Lysander, happy past the common lot,\r\n  Was warn'd of danger, but too gay to fear.\r\n  He woo'd the fair Aspasia: she was kind:\r\n  In youth, form, fortune, fame, they both were bless'd:\r\n  All who knew, envied; yet in envy loved:                          1037\r\n  Can fancy form more finish'd happiness?\r\n  Fix'd was the nuptial hour. Her stately dome\r\n  Rose on the sounding beach.

The news arrives:\r\n  Untold, she saw it in her servant's eye.\r\n  She felt it seen (her heart was apt to feel);\r\n  And, drown'd, without the furious ocean's aid,\r\n  In suffocating sorrows, shares his tomb.\r\n  Now, round the sumptuous bridal monument,                         1050\r\n  The guilty billows innocently roar;\r\n  And the rough sailor passing, drops a tear.\r\n  A tear?--can tears suffice?--But not for me.\r\n  How vain our efforts! and our arts, how vain!\r\n  The distant train of thought I took, to shun,\r\n  Has thrown me on my fate--these died together;\r\n  Happy in ruin! undivorced by death!\r\n  Or ne'er to meet, or ne'er to part,[27] is peace--\r\n  Narcissa! pity bleeds at thought of thee.\r\n  Yet thou wast only near me; not myself.                           1060\r\n  Survive myself?--That cures all other woe.\r\n  Narcissa lives; Philander is forgot.\r\n  O the soft commerce!

When such friends part,\r\n  'Tis the survivor dies--My heart! no more.                        1068\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  THE\r\n                           INFIDEL RECLAIMED,\r\n                             IN TWO PARTS;\r\n                               CONTAINING\r\n                   THE NATURE, PROOF, AND IMPORTANCE\r\n                            OF IMMORTALITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART I.\r\n\r\n\r\n              WHERE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, GLORY AND RICHES\r\n                      ARE PARTICULARLY CONSIDERED.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 TO THE\r\n                        RIGHT HON. HENRY PELHAM,\r\n     FIRST LORD COMMISSIONER OF THE TREASURY, AND CHANCELLOR OF THE\r\n                               EXCHEQUER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew ages have been deeper in dispute about religion than this. The\r\ndispute about religion, and the practice of it, seldom go together. The\r\nshorter, therefore, the dispute, the better. I think it may be reduced to\r\nthis single question, _Is man immortal, or is he not?_ If he is not, all\r\nour disputes are mere amusements, or trials of skill. In this case,\r\ntruth, reason, religion, which give our discourses such pomp and\r\nsolemnity, are (as will be shown) mere empty sound, without any meaning\r\nin them. But if man is immortal, it will behove him to be very serious\r\nabout eternal consequences; or, in other words, to be truly religious.\r\nAnd this great fundamental truth, unestablished, or unawakened in the\r\nminds of men, is, I conceive, the real source and support of all our\r\ninfidelity; how remote soever the particular objections advanced may seem\r\nto be from it.\r\n\r\nSensible appearances affect most men much more than abstract reasonings;\r\nand we daily see bodies drop around us, but the soul is invisible. The\r\npower which inclination has over the judgment, is greater than can be\r\nwell conceived by those that have not had an experience of it; and of\r\nwhat numbers is it the sad interest that souls should not survive! The\r\nheathen world confessed, that they rather hoped, than firmly believed,\r\nimmortality; and how many heathens have we still amongst us! The sacred\r\npage assures us, that life and immortality are brought to light by the\r\nGospel: but by how many is the Gospel rejected or overlooked? From these\r\nconsiderations, and from my being accidentally privy to the sentiments of\r\nsome particular persons, I have been long persuaded that most, if not\r\nall, our infidels (whatever name they take, and whatever scheme, for\r\nargument's sake, and to keep themselves in countenance, they patronise),\r\nare supported in their deplorable error, by some doubt of their\r\nimmortality, at the bottom. And I am satisfied, that men once thoroughly\r\nconvinced of their immortality, are not far from being Christians. For it\r\nis hard to conceive, that a man fully conscious eternal pain or happiness\r\nwill certainly be his lot, should not earnestly and impartially inquire\r\nafter the surest means of escaping the one, and securing the other. And\r\nof such an earnest and impartial inquiry I well know the consequence.\r\n\r\nHere, therefore, in proof of this most fundamental truth, some plain\r\narguments are offered; arguments derived from principles which infidels\r\nadmit in common with believers; arguments which appear to me altogether\r\nirresistible; and such as, I am satisfied, will have great weight with\r\nall who give themselves the small trouble of looking seriously into their\r\nown bosoms, and of observing, with any tolerable degree of attention,\r\nwhat daily passes round about them in the world. If some arguments shall\r\nhere occur, which others have declined, they are submitted, with all\r\ndeference, to better judgments in this, of all points the most important.\r\nFor, as to the being of a God, that is no longer disputed; but it is\r\nundisputed for this reason only, viz., because, where the least pretence\r\nto reason is admitted, it must for ever be indisputable. And of\r\nconsequence no man can be betrayed into a dispute of that nature by\r\nvanity; which has a principal share in animating our modern combatants\r\nagainst other articles of our belief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              NIGHT SIXTH.\r\n\r\n                         THE INFIDEL RECLAIMED.\r\n                                PART I.\r\n\r\n\r\n  She[28] (for I know not yet her name in heaven),\r\n  Not early, like Narcissa, left the scene;\r\n  Nor sudden, like Philander. What avail?\r\n  This seeming mitigation but inflames;\r\n  This fancied medicine heightens the disease.\r\n  The longer known, the closer still she grew;\r\n  And gradual parting is a gradual death.\r\n  'Tis the grim tyrant's engine, which extorts,\r\n  By tardy pressure's still-increasing weight,\r\n  From hardest hearts, confession of distress.                        10\r\n    Oh, the long, dark approach through years of pain,\r\n  Death's gallery! (might I dare to call it so)\r\n  With dismal doubt, and sable terror, hung;\r\n  Sick hope's pale lamp its only glimmering ray:\r\n  There, fate my melancholy walk ordain'd,\r\n  Forbid self-love itself to flatter, there.\r\n  How oft I gazed, prophetically sad!\r\n  How oft I saw her dead, while yet in smiles!                        18\r\n  In smiles she sunk her grief to lessen mine.\r\n  She spoke me comfort, and increased my pain.\r\n  Like powerful armies trenching at a town,\r\n  By slow, and silent, but resistless sap,\r\n  In his pale progress gently gaining ground,\r\n  Death urged his deadly siege; in spite of art,\r\n  Of all the balmy blessings nature lends\r\n  To succour frail humanity. Ye stars!\r\n  (Not now first made familiar to my sight)\r\n  And thou, O moon! bear witness, many a night\r\n  He tore the pillow from beneath my head,\r\n  Tied down my sore attention to the shock,                           30\r\n  By ceaseless depredations on a life\r\n  Dearer than that he left me. Dreadful post\r\n  Of observation! darker every hour!\r\n  Less dread the day that drove me to the brink,\r\n  And pointed at eternity below;\r\n  When my soul shudder'd at futurity;\r\n  When, on a moment's point, th' important die\r\n  Of life and death spun doubtful, ere it fell,\r\n  And turn'd up life; my title to more woe.\r\n    But why more woe? More comfort let it be.                         40\r\n  Nothing is dead, but that which wish'd to die;\r\n  Nothing is dead, but wretchedness and pain;\r\n  Nothing is dead, but what encumber'd, gall'd,\r\n  Block'd up the pass, and barr'd from real life.\r\n  Where dwells that wish most ardent of the wise?\r\n  Too dark the sun to see it; highest stars\r\n  Too low to reach it; Death, great Death alone,\r\n  O'er stars and sun, triumphant, lands us there.\r\n    Nor dreadful our transition; though the mind,\r\n  An artist at creating self-alarms,                                  50\r\n  Rich in expedients for inquietude,\r\n  Is prone to paint it dreadful. Who can take                         52\r\n  Death's portrait true? The tyrant never sat.\r\n  Our sketch all random strokes, conjecture all;\r\n  Close shuts the grave, nor tells one single tale.\r\n  Death, and his image rising in the brain,\r\n  Bear faint resemblance; never are alike;\r\n  Fear shakes the pencil; Fancy loves excess;\r\n  Dark Ignorance is lavish of her shades:\r\n  And these the formidable picture draw.                              60\r\n    But grant the worst; 'tis past; new prospects rise;\r\n  And drop a veil eternal o'er her tomb.\r\n  Far other views our contemplation claim,\r\n  Views that o'erpay the rigours of our life;\r\n  Views that suspend our agonies in death.\r\n  Wrapt in the thought of immortality,\r\n  Wrapt in the single, the triumphant thought!\r\n  Long life might lapse, age unperceived come on;\r\n  And find the soul unsated with her theme.\r\n  Its nature, proof, importance, fire my song.                        70\r\n  O that my song could emulate my soul!\r\n  Like her, immortal. No!--the soul disdains\r\n  A mark so mean; far nobler hope inflames;\r\n  If endless ages can outweigh an hour,\r\n  Let not the laurel, but the palm, inspire.\r\n    Thy nature, Immortality! who knows?\r\n  And yet who knows it not? It is but life\r\n  In stronger thread of brighter colour spun,\r\n  And spun for ever; dipp'd by cruel Fate\r\n  In Stygian dye, how black, how brittle here!                        80\r\n  How short our correspondence with the sun!\r\n  And while it lasts, inglorious! Our best deeds,\r\n  How wanting in their weight! our highest joys\r\n  Small cordials to support us in our pain,\r\n  And give us strength to suffer. But how great\r\n  To mingle interests, converse, amities,                             86\r\n  With all the sons of Reason, scatter'd wide\r\n  Through habitable space, wherever born,\r\n  Howe'er endow'd! to live free citizens\r\n  Of universal nature! to lay hold\r\n  By more than feeble faith on the Supreme!\r\n  To call heaven's rich unfathomable mines\r\n  (Mines, which support archangels in their state)                    93\r\n  Our own! To rise in science, as in bliss,\r\n  Initiate in the secrets of the skies!\r\n  To read creation; read its mighty plan\r\n  In the bare bosom of the Deity!\r\n  The plan, and execution, to collate!\r\n  To see, before each glance of piercing thought,\r\n  All cloud, all shadow, blown remote; and leave                     100\r\n  No mystery--but that of Love Divine,\r\n  Which lifts us on the seraph's flaming wing,\r\n  From earth's Aceldama, this field of blood,\r\n  Of inward anguish, and of outward ill,\r\n  From darkness, and from dust, to such a scene!\r\n  Love's element! true joy's illustrious home!\r\n  From earth's sad contrast (now deplored) more fair!\r\n  What exquisite vicissitude of fate!\r\n  Bless'd absolution of our blackest hour!\r\n    Lorenzo, these are thoughts that make man Man,                   110\r\n  The wise illumine, aggrandize the great.\r\n  How great (while yet we tread the kindred clod,\r\n  And every moment fear to sink beneath\r\n  The clod we tread; soon trodden by our sons);\r\n  How great, in the wild whirl of Time's pursuits,\r\n  To stop, and pause, involved in high presage,\r\n  Through the long vista of a thousand years,\r\n  To stand contemplating our distant selves,\r\n  As in a magnifying mirror seen,\r\n  Enlarged, ennobled, elevate, divine!                               120\r\n  To prophesy our own futurities;\r\n  To gaze in thought on what all thought transcends!\r\n  To talk, with fellow-candidates, of joys\r\n  As far beyond conception as desert,\r\n  Ourselves th' astonish'd talkers, and the tale!\r\n    Lorenzo, swells thy bosom at the thought?\r\n  The swell becomes thee: 'tis an honest pride.\r\n  Revere thyself;--and yet thyself despise.\r\n  His nature no man can o'er-rate; and none\r\n  Can under-rate his merit. Take good heed,                          130\r\n  Nor there be modest, where thou should'st be proud;\r\n  That almost universal error shun.\r\n  How just our pride, when we behold those heights!\r\n  Not those Ambition paints in air, but those\r\n  Reason points out, and ardent Virtue gains,\r\n  And angels emulate; our pride how just!\r\n  When mount we? when these shackles cast? when quit\r\n  This cell of the creation? this small nest,\r\n  Stuck in a corner of the universe,\r\n  Wrapt up in fleecy cloud, and fine-spun air?                       140\r\n  Fine-spun to sense; but gross and feculent\r\n  To souls celestial; souls ordain'd to breathe\r\n  Ambrosial gales, and drink a purer sky;\r\n  Greatly triumphant on Time's farther shore,\r\n  Where Virtue reigns, enrich'd with full arrears;\r\n  While Pomp imperial begs an alms of peace.\r\n    In empire high, or in proud science deep,\r\n  Ye born of earth! on what can you confer,\r\n  With half the dignity, with half the gain,\r\n  The gust, the glow of rational delight,                            150\r\n  As on this theme, which angels praise and share?\r\n  Man's fates and favours are a theme in heaven.\r\n    What wretched repetition cloys us here!\r\n  What periodic potions for the sick!                                154\r\n  Distemper'd bodies! and distemper'd minds!\r\n  In an eternity, what scenes shall strike!\r\n  Adventures thicken! novelties surprise!\r\n  What webs of wonder shall unravel, there!\r\n  What full day pour on all the paths of heaven,\r\n  And light th' Almighty's footsteps in the deep!\r\n  How shall the blessed day of our discharge\r\n  Unwind, at once, the labyrinths of fate,                           162\r\n  And straighten its inextricable maze!\r\n    If inextinguishable thirst in man\r\n  To know; how rich, how full, our banquet there!\r\n  There, not the moral world alone unfolds;\r\n  The world material, lately seen in shades,\r\n  And, in those shades, by fragments only seen,\r\n  And seen those fragments by the labouring eye,\r\n  Unbroken, then, illustrious, and entire,                           170\r\n  Its ample sphere, its universal frame,\r\n  In full dimensions, swells to the survey;\r\n  And enters, at one glance, the ravish'd sight.\r\n  From some superior point (where, who can tell?\r\n  Suffice it, 'tis a point where gods reside)\r\n  How shall the stranger man's illumined eye,\r\n  In the vast ocean of unbounded space,\r\n  Behold an infinite of floating worlds\r\n  Divide the crystal waves of ether pure,\r\n  In endless voyage, without port? The least                         180\r\n  Of these disseminated orbs, how great!\r\n  Great as they are, what numbers these surpass,\r\n  Huge, as Leviathan, to that small race,\r\n  Those twinkling multitudes of little life,\r\n  He swallows unperceived! Stupendous these!\r\n  Yet what are these stupendous to the whole?\r\n  As particles, as atoms ill perceived;\r\n  As circulating globules in our veins;                              188\r\n  So vast the plan. Fecundity divine!\r\n  Exuberant Source! perhaps, I wrong thee still.\r\n    If admiration is a source of joy,\r\n  What transport hence! Yet this the least in heaven.\r\n  What this to that illustrious robe He wears,\r\n  Who toss'd this mass of wonders from his hand,\r\n  A specimen, an earnest of his power?\r\n  'Tis to that glory, whence all glory flows,\r\n  As the mead's meanest floweret to the sun,\r\n  Which gave it birth. But what, this sun of heaven?\r\n  This bliss supreme of the supremely blest?\r\n  Death, only death, the question can resolve.                       200\r\n  By death, cheap bought th' ideas of our joy;\r\n  The bare ideas! solid happiness\r\n  So distant from its shadow chased below.\r\n    And chase we still the phantom through the fire,\r\n  O'er bog, and brake, and precipice, till death?\r\n  And toil we still for sublunary pay?\r\n  Defy the dangers of the field and flood,\r\n  Or, spider-like, spin out our precious all,\r\n  Our more than vitals spin (if no regard\r\n  To great futurity) in curious webs                                 210\r\n  Of subtle thought, and exquisite design;\r\n  (Fine network of the brain!) to catch a fly!\r\n  The momentary buzz of vain renown!\r\n  A name! a mortal immortality!\r\n    Or (meaner still!) instead of grasping air,\r\n  For sordid lucre plunge we in the mire?\r\n  Drudge, sweat, through every shame, for every gain,\r\n  For vile contaminating trash; throw up\r\n  Our hope in heaven, our dignity with man?\r\n  And deify the dirt, matured to gold?                               220\r\n  Ambition, Avarice; the two demons these,\r\n  Which goad through every slough our human herd,                    222\r\n  Hard-travell'd from the cradle to the grave.\r\n  How low the wretches stoop! how steep they climb!\r\n  These demons burn mankind; but most possess\r\n  Lorenzo's bosom, and turn out the skies.\r\n    Is it in time to hide eternity?\r\n  And why not in an atom on the shore\r\n  To cover ocean? or a mote, the sun?\r\n  Glory and wealth! have they this blinding power?                   230\r\n  What if to them I prove Lorenzo blind?\r\n  Would it surprise thee? Be thou then surprised;\r\n  Thou neither know'st: their nature learn from me.\r\n    Mark well, as foreign as these subjects seem,\r\n  What close connexion ties them to my theme.\r\n  First, what is true ambition? The pursuit\r\n  Of glory, nothing less than man can share.\r\n  Were they as vain, as gaudy-minded man,\r\n  As flatulent with fumes of self-applause,\r\n  Their arts and conquests animals might boast,                      240\r\n  And claim their laurel crowns, as well as we;\r\n  But not celestial. Here we stand alone;\r\n  As in our form, distinct, pre-eminent;\r\n  If prone in thought, our stature is our shame;\r\n  And man should blush, his forehead meets the skies.\r\n  The visible and present are for brutes,\r\n  A slender portion, and a narrow bound!\r\n  These Reason, with an energy divine,\r\n  O'erleaps; and claims the future and unseen;\r\n  The vast unseen! the future fathomless!                            250\r\n  When the great soul buoys up to this high point,\r\n  Leaving gross nature's sediments below,\r\n  Then, and then only, Adam's offspring quits\r\n  The sage and hero of the fields and woods,\r\n  Asserts his rank, and rises into man.                              255\r\n  This is ambition: this is human fire.\r\n    Can Parts or Place (two bold pretenders!) make\r\n  Lorenzo great, and pluck him from the throng?\r\n    Genius and Art, ambition's boasted wings,\r\n  Our boast but ill deserve. A feeble aid!\r\n  Dedalian enginery! If these alone\r\n  Assist our flight, Fame's flight is Glory's fall.\r\n  Heart merit wanting, mount we ne'er so high,                       263\r\n  Our height is but the gibbet of our name.\r\n  A celebrated wretch, when I behold,\r\n  When I behold a genius bright, and base,\r\n  Of towering talents, and terrestrial aims;\r\n  Methinks I see, as thrown from her high sphere,\r\n  The glorious fragments of a soul immortal,\r\n  With rubbish mix'd, and glittering in the dust.                    270\r\n  Struck at the splendid, melancholy sight,\r\n  At once compassion soft, and envy, rise--\r\n  But wherefore envy? Talents angel-bright,\r\n  If wanting worth, are shining instruments\r\n  In false ambition's hand, to finish faults\r\n  Illustrious, and give infamy renown.\r\n    Great ill is an achievement of great powers.\r\n  Plain sense but rarely leads us far astray.\r\n  Reason the means, affections choose our end;\r\n  Means have no merit, if our end amiss.                             280\r\n  If wrong our hearts, our heads are right in vain:\r\n  What is a Pelham's head, to Pelham's heart?\r\n  Hearts are proprietors of all applause.\r\n  Right ends, and means, make wisdom: worldly-wise\r\n  Is but half-witted, at its highest praise.\r\n    Let Genius then despair to make thee great;\r\n  Nor flatter Station: what is station high?\r\n  'Tis a proud mendicant; it boasts, and begs;\r\n  It begs an alms of homage from the throng,                         289\r\n  And oft the throng denies its charity.\r\n  Monarchs and ministers, are awful names;\r\n  Whoever wear them, challenge our devoir.\r\n  Religion, public order, both exact\r\n  External homage, and a supple knee,\r\n  To beings pompously set up, to serve\r\n  The meanest slave: all more is merit's due,\r\n  Her sacred and inviolable right;\r\n  Nor ever paid the monarch, but the man.\r\n  Our hearts ne'er bow but to superior worth;\r\n  Nor ever fail of their allegiance there.                           300\r\n  Fools, indeed, drop the man in their account,\r\n  And vote the mantle into majesty.\r\n  Let the small savage boast his silver fur;\r\n  His royal robe unborrow'd, and unbought,\r\n  His own, descending fairly from his sires.\r\n  Shall man be proud to wear his livery,\r\n  And souls in ermine scorn a soul without?\r\n  Can place or lessen us, or aggrandize?\r\n  Pigmies are pigmies still, though perch'd on Alps;\r\n  And pyramids are pyramids in vales.                                310\r\n  Each man makes his own stature, builds himself:\r\n  Virtue alone outbuilds the pyramids:\r\n  Her monuments shall last, when Egypt's fall.\r\n    Of these sure truths dost thou demand the cause?\r\n  The cause is lodged in immortality.\r\n  Hear, and assent. Thy bosom burns for power;\r\n  What station charms thee? I'll install thee there;\r\n  'Tis thine. And art thou greater than before?\r\n  Then thou before wast something less than man.\r\n  Has thy new post betray'd thee into pride?                         320\r\n  That treacherous pride betrays thy dignity;\r\n  That pride defames humanity, and calls\r\n  The being mean, which staffs or strings can raise.                 323\r\n  That pride, like hooded hawks, in darkness soars,\r\n  From blindness bold, and towering to the skies.\r\n  'Tis born of ignorance, which knows not man:\r\n  An angel's second; nor his second, long.\r\n  A Nero quitting his imperial throne,\r\n  And courting glory from the tinkling string,\r\n  But faintly shadows an immortal soul,                              330\r\n  With empire's self, to pride, or rapture, fired.\r\n  If nobler motives minister no cure,\r\n  Even vanity forbids thee to be vain.\r\n    High worth is elevated place: 'tis more;\r\n  It makes the post stand candidate for thee;\r\n  Makes more than monarchs, makes an honest man;\r\n  Though no exchequer it commands, 'tis wealth;\r\n  And though it wears no riband, 'tis renown;\r\n  Renown, that would not quit thee, though disgraced,\r\n  Nor leave thee pendent on a master's smile.                        340\r\n  Other ambition Nature interdicts;\r\n  Nature proclaims it most absurd in man,\r\n  By pointing at his origin, and end;\r\n  Milk, and a swathe, at first, his whole demand;\r\n  His whole domain, at last, a turf, or stone;\r\n  To whom, between, a world may seem too small.\r\n    Souls truly great dart forward on the wing\r\n  Of just ambition, to the grand result,\r\n  The curtain's fall; there, see the buskin'd chief\r\n  Unshod behind this momentary scene;                                350\r\n  Reduced to his own stature, low or high,\r\n  As vice, or virtue, sinks him, or sublimes;\r\n  And laugh at this fantastic mummery,\r\n  This antic prelude of grotesque events,\r\n  Where dwarfs are often stilted, and betray\r\n  A littleness of soul by worlds o'errun,\r\n  And nations laid in blood. Dread sacrifice                         357\r\n  To Christian pride! which had with horror shock'd\r\n  The darkest Pagans, offer'd to their gods.\r\n    O thou most Christian[29] enemy to peace!\r\n  Again in arms? Again provoking fate?\r\n  That prince, and that alone, is truly great,\r\n  Who draws the sword reluctant, gladly sheathes;                    363\r\n  On empire builds what empire far outweighs,\r\n  And makes his throne a scaffold to the skies.\r\n    Why this so rare? Because forgot of all\r\n  The day of death; that venerable day,\r\n  Which sits as judge; that day, which shall pronounce\r\n  On all our days, absolve them, or condemn.\r\n  Lorenzo, never shut thy thought against it;                        370\r\n  Be levees ne'er so full, afford it room,\r\n  And give it audience in the cabinet.\r\n  That friend consulted, flatteries apart,\r\n  Will tell thee fair, if thou art great, or mean.\r\n    To doat on aught may leave us, or be left,\r\n  Is that ambition? Then let flames descend,\r\n  Point to the centre their inverted spires,\r\n  And learn humiliation from a soul,\r\n  Which boasts her lineage from celestial fire.\r\n  Yet these are they, the world pronounces wise;                     380\r\n  The world, which cancels nature's right and wrong,\r\n  And casts new wisdom: even the grave man lends\r\n  His solemn face, to countenance the coin.\r\n  Wisdom for parts is madness for the whole.\r\n  This stamps the paradox, and gives us leave\r\n  To call the wisest weak, the richest poor,\r\n  The most ambitious, unambitious, mean;\r\n  In triumph, mean; and abject, on a throne.\r\n  Nothing can make it less than mad in man,\r\n  To put forth all his ardour, all his art,                          390\r\n  And give his soul her full unbounded flight,\r\n  But reaching Him, who gave her wings to fly.\r\n  When blind Ambition quite mistakes her road,\r\n  And downwards pores, for that which shines above,\r\n  Substantial happiness, and true renown;\r\n  Then, like an idiot, gazing on the brook,\r\n  We leap at stars, and fasten in the mud;\r\n  At glory grasp, and sink in infamy.\r\n    Ambition! powerful source of good and ill!\r\n  Thy strength in man, like length of wing in birds,                 400\r\n  When disengaged from earth, with greater ease,\r\n  And swifter flight, transports us to the skies;\r\n  By toys entangled, or in guilt bemired,\r\n  It turns a curse; it is our chain, and scourge,\r\n  In this dark dungeon, where confined we lie,\r\n  Close grated by the sordid bars of Sense;\r\n  All prospect of eternity shut out;\r\n  And, but for execution, ne'er set free.\r\n    With error in ambition justly charged,\r\n  Find we Lorenzo wiser in his wealth?                               410\r\n  What if thy rental I reform? and draw\r\n  An inventory new, to set thee right?\r\n  Where thy true treasure? Gold says, \"Not in me:\"\r\n  And, \"Not in me,\" the diamond. Gold is poor;\r\n  India's insolvent: seek it in thyself,\r\n  Seek in thy naked self, and find it there;\r\n  In being, so descended, form'd, endow'd;\r\n  Sky-born, sky-guided, sky-returning race!\r\n  Erect, immortal, rational, divine!\r\n  In senses, which inherit earth, and heavens;                       420\r\n  Enjoy the various riches Nature yields;\r\n  Far nobler! give the riches they enjoy;\r\n  Give taste to fruits; and harmony to groves;\r\n  Their radiant beams to gold, and gold's bright fire;               424\r\n  Take in, at once, the landscape of the world,\r\n  At a small inlet, which a grain might close,\r\n  And half create the wondrous world they see.\r\n  Our senses, as our reason, are divine.\r\n  But for the magic organ's powerful charm,\r\n  Earth were a rude, uncolour'd chaos still.\r\n  Objects are but th' occasion; ours th' exploit;\r\n  Ours is the cloth,[30] the pencil, and the paint,                  432\r\n  Which nature's admirable picture draws;\r\n  And beautifies creation's ample dome.\r\n  Like Milton's Eve, when gazing on the lake,\r\n  Man makes the matchless image man admires.\r\n  Say then, shall man, his thoughts all sent abroad,\r\n  Superior wonders in himself forgot,\r\n  His admiration waste on objects round,\r\n  When Heaven makes him the soul of all he sees?                     440\r\n  Absurd! not rare! so great, so mean, is man.\r\n    What wealth in senses such as these! What wealth\r\n  In Fancy, fired to form a fairer scene\r\n  Than Sense surveys! In memory's firm record,\r\n  Which, should it perish, could this world recall\r\n  From the dark shadows of o'erwhelming years!\r\n  In colours fresh, originally bright,\r\n  Preserve its portrait, and report its fate!\r\n  What wealth in Intellect, that sovereign power!\r\n  Which Sense and Fancy summons to the bar;                          450\r\n  Interrogates, approves, or reprehends;\r\n  And from the mass those underlings import,\r\n  From their materials sifted, and refined,\r\n  And in Truth's balance accurately weigh'd,\r\n  Forms art, and science, government, and law;\r\n  The solid basis, and the beauteous frame,                          456\r\n  The vitals, and the grace of civil life!\r\n  And manners (sad exception!) set aside,\r\n  Strikes out, with master hand, a copy fair\r\n  Of His idea, whose indulgent thought\r\n  Long, long, ere chaos teem'd, plann'd human bliss.\r\n    What wealth in souls that soar, dive, range around,\r\n  Disdaining limit, or from place, or time;                          463\r\n  And hear at once, in thought extensive, hear\r\n  Th' Almighty fiat, and the trumpet's sound!\r\n  Bold, on creation's outside walk, and view\r\n  What was, and is, and more than e'er shall be;\r\n  Commanding, with omnipotence of thought,\r\n  Creations new in fancy's field to rise!\r\n  Souls, that can grasp whate'er th' Almighty made,                  470\r\n  And wander wild through things impossible!\r\n  What wealth, in faculties of endless growth,\r\n  In quenchless passions violent to crave,\r\n  In liberty to choose, in power to reach,\r\n  And in duration (how thy riches rise!)\r\n  Duration to perpetuate--boundless bliss!\r\n    Ask you, what power resides in feeble man\r\n  That bliss to gain? Is Virtue's, then, unknown?\r\n  Virtue, our present peace, our future prize.\r\n  Man's unprecarious, natural estate,                                480\r\n  Improveable at will, in virtue lies;\r\n  Its tenure sure; its income is divine.\r\n    High-built abundance, heap on heap! for what?\r\n  To breed new wants, and beggar us the more;\r\n  Then make a richer scramble for the throng?\r\n  Soon as this feeble pulse, which leaps so long\r\n  Almost by miracle, is tired with play,\r\n  Like rubbish from disploding engines thrown,\r\n  Our magazines of hoarded trifles fly;\r\n  Fly diverse; fly to foreigners, to foes;                           490\r\n  New masters court, and call the former fools\r\n  (How justly!), for dependence on their stay.\r\n  Wide scatter, first, our playthings; then, our dust.\r\n    Dost court abundance for the sake of peace?\r\n  Learn, and lament thy self-defeated scheme:\r\n  Riches enable to be richer still;\r\n  And, richer still, what mortal can resist?\r\n  Thus wealth (a cruel taskmaster!) enjoins\r\n  New toils, succeeding toils, an endless train!\r\n  And murders peace, which taught it first to shine.                 500\r\n  The poor are half as wretched as the rich;\r\n  Whose proud and painful privilege it is\r\n  At once, to bear a double load of woe;\r\n  To feel the stings of envy, and of want,\r\n  Outrageous want! both Indies cannot cure.\r\n    A competence is vital to content.\r\n  Much wealth is corpulence, if not disease;\r\n  Sick, or encumber'd, is our happiness,\r\n  A competence is all we can enjoy.\r\n  Oh, be content, where Heaven can give no more!                     510\r\n  More, like a flash of water from a lock,\r\n  Quickens our spirits' movement for an hour;\r\n  But soon its force is spent, nor rise our joys\r\n  Above our native temper's common stream.\r\n  Hence disappointment lurks in every prize,\r\n  As bees in flowers; and stings us with success.\r\n    The rich man, who denies it, proudly feigns;\r\n  Nor knows the wise are privy to the lie.\r\n  Much learning shows how little mortals know;\r\n  Much wealth, how little worldlings can enjoy:                      520\r\n  At best, it babies us with endless toys,\r\n  And keeps us children till we drop to dust.\r\n  As monkeys at a mirror stand amazed,\r\n  They fail to find what they so plainly see;                        524\r\n  Thus men, in shining riches, see the face\r\n  Of happiness, nor know it is a shade;\r\n  But gaze, and touch, and peep, and peep again,\r\n  And wish, and wonder it is absent still.\r\n    How few can rescue opulence from want!\r\n  Who lives to Nature, rarely can be poor;\r\n  Who lives to Fancy, never can be rich.\r\n  Poor is the man in debt; the man of gold,                          532\r\n  In debt to Fortune, trembles at her power.\r\n  The man of reason smiles at her, and Death.\r\n  Oh! what a patrimony this! a being\r\n  Of such inherent strength and majesty,\r\n  Not worlds possess'd can raise it; worlds destroy'd\r\n  Can't injure; which holds on its glorious course,\r\n  When thine, O Nature! ends; too blest to mourn\r\n  Creation's obsequies. What treasure, this!                         540\r\n  The monarch is a beggar to the man.\r\n    Immortal! Ages past, yet nothing gone!\r\n  Morn without eve! a race without a goal!\r\n  Unshorten'd by progression infinite!\r\n  Futurity for ever future! Life\r\n  Beginning still where computation ends!\r\n  'Tis the description of a deity!\r\n  'Tis the description of the meanest slave:\r\n  The meanest slave dares then Lorenzo scorn?\r\n  The meanest slave thy sovereign glory shares.                      550\r\n  Proud youth! fastidious of the lower world!\r\n  Man's lawful pride includes humility;\r\n  Stoops to the lowest; is too great to find\r\n  Inferiors; all immortal! brothers all!\r\n  Proprietors eternal of thy love.\r\n    Immortal! What can strike the sense so strong,\r\n  As this the soul? It thunders to the thought;\r\n  Reason amazes; gratitude o'erwhelms;                               558\r\n  No more we slumber on the brink of fate;\r\n  Roused at the sound, th' exulting soul ascends,\r\n  And breathes her native air; an air that feeds\r\n  Ambitions high, and fans ethereal fires;\r\n  Quick kindles all that is divine within us;\r\n  Nor leaves one loitering thought beneath the stars.\r\n    Has not Lorenzo's bosom caught the flame?\r\n  Immortal! Were but one immortal, how\r\n  Would others envy! how would thrones adore!\r\n  Because 'tis common, is the blessing lost?\r\n  How this ties up the bounteous hand of Heaven!                     569\r\n  Oh, vain, vain, vain, all else! Eternity!\r\n  A glorious and a needful refuge, that,\r\n  From vile imprisonment, in abject views.\r\n  'Tis immortality, 'tis that alone,\r\n  Amid life's pains, abasements, emptiness,\r\n  The soul can comfort, elevate, and fill.\r\n  That only, and that amply, this performs;\r\n  Lifts us above life's pains, her joys above;\r\n  Their terror those, and these their lustre lose;\r\n  Eternity depending covers all;\r\n  Eternity depending all achieves;                                   580\r\n  Sets earth at distance; casts her into shades;\r\n  Blends her distinctions; abrogates her powers;\r\n  The low, the lofty, joyous, and severe,\r\n  Fortune's dread frowns, and fascinating smiles,\r\n  Make one promiscuous and neglected heap,\r\n  The man beneath; if I may call him man,\r\n  Whom immortality's full force inspires.\r\n  Nothing terrestrial touches his high thought;\r\n  Suns shine unseen, and thunders roll unheard,\r\n  By minds quite conscious of their high descent,                    590\r\n  Their present province, and their future prize;\r\n  Divinely darting upward every wish,                                592\r\n  Warm on the wing, in glorious absence lost!\r\n    Doubt you this truth? Why labours your belief?\r\n  If earth's whole orb by some due distanced eye\r\n  Were seen at once, her towering Alps would sink,\r\n  And levell'd Atlas leave an even sphere.\r\n  Thus earth, and all that earthly minds admire,\r\n  Is swallow'd in eternity's vast round.\r\n  To that stupendous view, when souls awake,                         600\r\n  So large of late, so mountainous to man,\r\n  Time's toys subside; and equal all below.\r\n    Enthusiastic, this? Then all are weak,\r\n  But rank enthusiasts. To this godlike height\r\n  Some souls have soar'd; or martyrs ne'er had bled,\r\n  And all may do, what has by man been done.\r\n  Who, beaten by these sublunary storms,\r\n  Boundless, interminable joys can weigh,\r\n  Unraptured, unexalted, uninflamed?\r\n  What slave unblest, who from to-morrow's dawn                      610\r\n  Expects an empire? He forgets his chain,\r\n  And, throned in thought, his absent sceptre waves.\r\n    And what a sceptre waits us! what a throne!\r\n  Her own immense appointments to compute,\r\n  Or comprehend her high prerogatives,\r\n  In this her dark minority, how toils,\r\n  How vainly pants, the human soul divine!\r\n  Too great the bounty seems for earthly joy;\r\n  What heart but trembles at so strange a bliss?\r\n    In spite of all the truths the Muse has sung,                    620\r\n  Ne'er to be prized enough! enough revolved!\r\n  Are there who wrap the world so close about them,\r\n  They see no farther than the clouds; and dance\r\n  On heedless vanity's fantastic toe,\r\n  Till, stumbling at a straw, in their career,\r\n  Headlong they plunge, where end both dance and song?\r\n  Are there, Lorenzo? is it possible?                                627\r\n  Are there on earth (let me not call them men)\r\n  Who lodge a soul immortal in their breasts;\r\n  Unconscious as the mountain of its ore;\r\n  Or rock of its inestimable gem?\r\n  When rocks shall melt, and mountains vanish, these\r\n  Shall know their treasure; treasure, then, no more.                633\r\n    Are there (still more amazing!) who resist\r\n  The rising thought? who smother, in its birth,\r\n  The glorious truth? who struggle to be brutes?\r\n  Who through this bosom-barrier burst their way,\r\n  And, with reversed ambition, strive to sink?\r\n  Who labour downwards through th' opposing powers\r\n  Of instinct, reason, and the world against them,                   640\r\n  To dismal hopes, and shelter in the shock\r\n  Of endless night; night darker than the grave's?\r\n  Who fight the proofs of immortality?\r\n  With horrid zeal, and execrable arts,\r\n  Work all their engines, level their black fires,\r\n  To blot from man this attribute divine\r\n  (Than vital blood far dearer to the wise),\r\n  Blasphemers, and rank atheists to themselves?\r\n    To contradict them, see all nature rise!\r\n  What object, what event, the moon beneath,                         650\r\n  But argues, or endears, an after-scene?\r\n  To reason proves, or weds it to desire?\r\n  All things proclaim it needful; some advance\r\n  One precious step beyond, and prove it sure.\r\n  A thousand arguments swarm round my pen,\r\n  From heaven, and earth, and man. Indulge a few,\r\n  By Nature, as her common habit, worn;\r\n  So pressing Providence a truth to teach,\r\n  Which truth untaught, all other truths were vain.\r\n    Thou! whose all-providential eye surveys,                        660\r\n  Whose hand directs, whose Spirit fills and warms\r\n  Creation, and holds empire far beyond!\r\n  Eternity's inhabitant august!\r\n  Of two eternities amazing Lord!\r\n  One past, ere man's, or angel's, had begun\r\n  Aid! while I rescue from the foe's assault\r\n  Thy glorious immortality in man:\r\n  A theme for ever, and for all, of weight,\r\n  Of moment infinite! but relish'd most\r\n  By those who love Thee most, who most adore.                       670\r\n    Nature, thy daughter, ever-changing birth\r\n  Of Thee the Great Immutable, to man\r\n  Speaks wisdom, is his oracle supreme;\r\n  And he who most consults her, is most wise.\r\n  Lorenzo, to this heavenly Delphos haste;\r\n  And come back all-immortal, all-divine:\r\n  Look nature through, 'tis revolution all;\r\n  All change; no death. Day follows night; and night\r\n  The dying day; stars rise, and set, and rise;\r\n  Earth takes th' example. See, the summer gay,                      680\r\n  With her green chaplet, and ambrosial flowers,\r\n  Droops into pallid autumn: winter grey,\r\n  Horrid with frost, and turbulent with storm,\r\n  Blows autumn, and his golden fruits, away:\r\n  Then melts into the spring: soft spring, with breath\r\n  Favonian, from warm chambers of the south,\r\n  Recalls the first. All, to re-flourish, fades;\r\n  As in a wheel, all sinks, to re-ascend.\r\n  Emblems of man, who passes, not expires.\r\n    With this minute distinction, emblems just,                      690\r\n  Nature revolves, but man advances; both\r\n  Eternal, that a circle, this a line.\r\n  That gravitates, this soars. Th' aspiring soul,\r\n  Ardent, and tremulous, like flame, ascends,                        694\r\n  Zeal and humility her wings, to heaven.\r\n  The world of matter, with its various forms,\r\n  All dies into new life. Life born from death\r\n  Rolls the vast mass, and shall for ever roll.\r\n  No single atom, once in being, lost,\r\n  With change of counsel charges the Most High.\r\n    What hence infers Lorenzo? Can it be?\r\n  Matter immortal? And shall Spirit die?                             702\r\n  Above the nobler, shall less noble rise?\r\n  Shall Man alone, for whom all else revives,\r\n  No resurrection know?

A land of levity is a land of guilt. A serious mind\r\nis the native soil of every virtue; and the single character that does\r\ntrue honour to mankind. The soul's immortality has been the favourite\r\ntheme with the serious of all ages. Nor is it strange: it is a subject by\r\nfar the most interesting and important that can enter the mind of man. Of\r\nhighest moment this subject always was, and always will be. Yet this its\r\nhighest moment seems to admit of increase, at this day; a sort of\r\noccasional importance is superadded to the natural weight of it; if that\r\nopinion which is advanced in the Preface to the preceding Night be just.\r\nIt is there supposed, that all our infidels, whatever scheme, for\r\nargument's sake, and to keep themselves in countenance, they patronise,\r\nare betrayed into their deplorable error, by some doubts of their\r\nimmortality, at the bottom. And the more I consider this point, the more\r\nI am persuaded of the truth of that opinion. Though the distrust of a\r\nfuturity is a strange error; yet it is an error into which bad men may\r\nnaturally be distressed. For it is impossible to bid defiance to final\r\nruin, without some refuge in imagination, some presumption of escape. And\r\nwhat presumption is there? There are but two in nature; but two, within\r\nthe compass of human thought. And these are,--That either God will not,\r\nor can not, punish. Considering the divine attributes, the first is too\r\ngross to be digested by our strongest wishes. And since omnipotence is as\r\nmuch a divine attribute as holiness, that God cannot punish, is as absurd\r\na supposition as the former. God certainly can punish as long as wicked\r\nmen exist. In non-existence, therefore, is their only refuge; and,\r\nconsequently, non-existence is their strongest wish. And strong wishes\r\nhave a strange influence on our opinions; they bias the judgment in a\r\nmanner almost incredible. And since on this member of their alternative,\r\nthere are some very small appearances in their favour, and none at all on\r\nthe other, they catch at this reed, they lay hold on this chimera, to\r\nsave themselves from the shock and horror of an immediate and absolute\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nOn reviewing my subject, by the light which this argument, and others of\r\nlike tendency, threw upon it, I was more inclined than ever to pursue it,\r\nas it appeared to me to strike directly at the main root of all our\r\ninfidelity. In the following pages it is, accordingly, pursued at large;\r\nand some arguments for immortality, new at least to me, are ventured on\r\nin them. There also the writer has made an attempt to set the gross\r\nabsurdities and horrors of annihilation in a fuller and more affecting\r\nview than is (I think) to be met with elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen, for whose sake this attempt was chiefly made, profess\r\ngreat admiration for the wisdom of heathen antiquity: what pity it is\r\nthey are not sincere! If they were sincere, how would it mortify them to\r\nconsider, with what contempt and abhorrence their notions would have been\r\nreceived by those whom they so much admire! What degree of contempt and\r\nabhorrence would fall to their share, may be conjectured by the following\r\nmatter of fact (in my opinion) extremely memorable. Of all their heathen\r\nworthies, Socrates (it is well known) was the most guarded,\r\ndispassionate, and composed: yet this great master of temper was angry;\r\nand angry at his last hour; and angry with his friend; and angry for what\r\ndeserved acknowledgment; angry for a right and tender instance of true\r\nfriendship towards him. Is not this surprising? What could be the cause?\r\nThe cause was for his honour; it was a truly noble, though, perhaps, a\r\ntoo punctilious, regard for immortality. For his friend asking him, with\r\nsuch an affectionate concern as became a friend, \"where he should deposit\r\nhis remains,\" it was resented by Socrates, as implying a dishonourable\r\nsupposition, that he could be so mean, as to have a regard for anything,\r\neven in himself, that was not immortal.\r\n\r\nThis fact well considered, would make our infidels withdraw their\r\nadmiration from Socrates; or make them endeavour, by their imitation of\r\nthis illustrious example, to share his glory: and, consequently, it would\r\nincline them to peruse the following pages with candour and impartiality;\r\nwhich is all I desire; and that, for their sakes: for I am persuaded,\r\nthat an unprejudiced infidel must, necessarily, receive some advantageous\r\nimpressions from them.\r\n\r\n_July_ 7, 1744.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             NIGHT SEVENTH.\r\n\r\n                         THE INFIDEL RECLAIMED.\r\n                                PART II.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS.\r\n\r\nIn the Sixth Night arguments were drawn, from Nature, in proof of\r\nImmortality: here, others are drawn from Man: from his Discontent, ver.\r\n29; from his Passions and Powers, 63; from the gradual growth of Reason,\r\n81; from his fear of Death, 86; from the nature of Hope, 104; and of\r\nVirtue, 159, &c.; from Knowledge and Love, as being the most essential\r\nproperties of the soul, 253; from the order of Creation, 290, &c.; from\r\nthe nature of Ambition, 337, &c.; Avarice, 460; Pleasure, 477.

Man but dives in death;\r\n  Dives from the sun, in fairer day to rise;\r\n  The grave, his subterranean road to bliss.                          10\r\n  Yes, infinite indulgence plann'd it so;\r\n  Through various parts our glorious story runs;\r\n  Time gives the preface, endless age unrolls\r\n  The volume (ne'er unroll'd!) of human fate.\r\n    This, earth and skies already[32] have proclaim'd.\r\n  The world's a prophecy of worlds to come;\r\n  And who, what God foretells (who speaks in things,\r\n  Still louder than in words) shall dare deny?\r\n  If Nature's arguments appear too weak,\r\n  Turn a new leaf, and stronger read in Man.                          20\r\n  If man sleeps on, untaught by what he sees,\r\n  Can he prove infidel to what he feels?\r\n  He, whose blind thought futurity denies,\r\n  Unconscious bears, Bellerophon![33] like thee,\r\n  His own indictment; he condemns himself;\r\n  Who reads his bosom, reads immortal life;\r\n  Or, Nature, there, imposing on her sons,\r\n  Has written fables; man was made a lie.\r\n    Why Discontent for ever harbour'd there?\r\n  Incurable consumption of our peace!                                 30\r\n  Resolve me, why, the cottager, and king,\r\n  He, whom sea-sever'd realms obey, and he\r\n  Who steals his whole dominion from the waste,\r\n  Repelling winter blasts with mud and straw                          34\r\n  Disquieted alike, draw sigh for sigh,\r\n  In fate so distant, in complaint so near?\r\n    Is it, that things terrestrial can't content?\r\n  Deep in rich pasture will thy flocks complain?\r\n  Not so; but to their master is denied\r\n  To share their sweet serene. Man, ill at ease,\r\n  In this, not his own place, this foreign field,\r\n  Where Nature fodders him with other food,                           42\r\n  Than was ordain'd his cravings to suffice,\r\n  Poor in abundance, famish'd at a feast,\r\n  Sighs on for something more, when most enjoy'd.\r\n    Is Heaven, then, kinder to thy flocks than thee?\r\n  Not so; thy pasture richer, but remote;\r\n  In part, remote; for that remoter part\r\n  Man bleats from instinct, though perhaps, debauch'd\r\n  By sense, his reason sleeps, nor dreams the cause.                  50\r\n  The cause how obvious, when his reason wakes!\r\n  His grief is but his grandeur in disguise;\r\n  And discontent is immortality.\r\n    Shall sons of ether, shall the blood of heaven,\r\n  Set up their hopes on earth, and stable here,\r\n  With brutal acquiescence in the mire?\r\n  Lorenzo, no! they shall be nobly pain'd;\r\n  The glorious foreigners, distress'd, shall sigh\r\n  On thrones; and thou congratulate the sigh:\r\n  Man's misery declares him born for bliss;                           60\r\n  His anxious heart asserts the truth I sing,\r\n  And gives the sceptic in his head the lie.\r\n    Our heads, our hearts, our passions, and our powers,\r\n  Speak the same language; call us to the skies:\r\n  Unripen'd these in this inclement clime,\r\n  Scarce rise above conjecture, and mistake;\r\n  And for this land of trifles those too strong\r\n  Tumultuous rise, and tempest human life:                            68\r\n  What prize on earth can pay us for the storm?\r\n  Meet objects for our passions Heaven ordain'd,\r\n  Objects that challenge all their fire, and leave\r\n  No fault, but in defect: bless'd Heaven! avert\r\n  A bounded ardour for unbounded bliss!\r\n  O for a bliss unbounded! Far beneath\r\n  A soul immortal, is a mortal joy.\r\n  Nor are our powers to perish immature;\r\n  But, after feeble effort here, beneath\r\n  A brighter sun, and in a nobler soil,\r\n  Transplanted from this sublunary bed,\r\n  Shall flourish fair, and put forth all their bloom.                 80\r\n    Reason progressive, Instinct is complete;\r\n  Swift Instinct leaps; slow Reason feebly climbs.\r\n  Brutes soon their zenith reach; their little all\r\n  Flows in at once; in ages they no more\r\n  Could know, or do, or covet, or enjoy.\r\n  Were man to live coeval with the sun,\r\n  The patriarch-pupil would be learning still;\r\n  Yet, dying, leave his lesson half unlearn'd.\r\n  Men perish in advance, as if the sun\r\n  Should set ere noon, in eastern oceans drown'd;                     90\r\n  If fit, with dim, illustrious to compare,\r\n  The sun's meridian with the soul of man.\r\n  To man, why, stepdame Nature! so severe?\r\n  Why thrown aside thy masterpiece half wrought,\r\n  While meaner efforts thy last hand enjoy?\r\n  Or, if abortively, poor man must die,\r\n  Nor reach, what reach he might, why die in dread?\r\n  Why cursed with foresight? wise to misery?\r\n  Why of his proud prerogative the prey?\r\n  Why less pre-eminent in rank than pain?                            100\r\n  His immortality alone can tell;\r\n  Full ample fund to balance all amiss,                              102\r\n  And turn the scale in favour of the just!\r\n    His immortality alone can solve\r\n  The darkest of enigmas, human hope;\r\n  Of all the darkest, if at death we die.\r\n  Hope, eager Hope, th' assassin of our joy,\r\n  All present blessings treading under foot,\r\n  Is scarce a milder tyrant than Despair.\r\n  With no past toils content, still planting new,                    110\r\n  Hope turns us o'er to death alone for ease.\r\n  Possession, why more tasteless than pursuit?\r\n  Why is a wish far dearer than a crown?\r\n  That wish accomplish'd, why the grave of bliss?\r\n  Because, in the great future buried deep,\r\n  Beyond our plans of empire and renown,\r\n  Lies all that man with ardour should pursue;\r\n  And He who made him, bent him to the right.\r\n    Man's heart th' Almighty to the future sets,\r\n  By secret and inviolable springs;                                  120\r\n  And makes his hope his sublunary joy.\r\n  Man's heart eats all things, and is hungry still;\r\n  \"More, more!\" the glutton cries: for something new\r\n  So rages appetite, if man can't mount,\r\n  He will descend. He starves on the possess'd.\r\n  Hence, the world's master, from ambition's spire,\r\n  In Caprea plunged; and dived beneath the brute.\r\n  In that rank sty why wallow'd empire's son\r\n  Supreme? Because he could no higher fly;\r\n  His riot was ambition in despair.                                  130\r\n    Old Rome consulted birds; Lorenzo! thou\r\n  With more success, the flight of Hope survey;\r\n  Of restless Hope, for ever on the wing.\r\n  High perch'd o'er every thought that falcon sits,\r\n  To fly at all that rises in her sight;\r\n  And never stooping, but to mount again                             136\r\n  Next moment, she betrays her aim's mistake,\r\n  And owns her quarry lodged beyond the grave.\r\n    There should it fail us (it must fail us there,\r\n  If being fails), more mournful riddles rise,\r\n  And Virtue vies with Hope in mystery.\r\n  Why Virtue? where its praise, its being, fled?\r\n  Virtue is true self-interest pursued:                              143\r\n  What true self-interest of quite-mortal man?\r\n  To close with all that makes him happy here.\r\n  If vice (as sometimes) is our friend on earth,\r\n  Then vice is virtue; 'tis our sovereign good.\r\n  In self-applause is virtue's golden prize;\r\n  No self-applause attends it on thy scheme:\r\n  Whence self-applause? From conscience of the right.\r\n  And what is right, but means of happiness?                         151\r\n  No means of happiness when virtue yields;\r\n  That basis failing, falls the building too,\r\n  And lays in ruin every virtuous joy.\r\n    The rigid guardian of a blameless heart,\r\n  So long revered, so long reputed wise,\r\n  Is weak; with rank knight-errantries o'errun.\r\n  Why beats thy bosom with illustrious dreams\r\n  Of self-exposure, laudable, and great?\r\n  Of gallant enterprise, and glorious death?                         160\r\n  Die for thy country!--Thou romantic fool!\r\n  Seize, seize the plank thyself, and let her sink:\r\n  Thy country! what to thee?--the Godhead, what?\r\n  (I speak with awe!) though He should bid thee bleed?\r\n  If, with thy blood, thy final hope is spilt,\r\n  Nor can Omnipotence reward the blow,\r\n  Be deaf; preserve thy being; disobey.\r\n    Nor is it disobedience: know, Lorenzo!\r\n  Whate'er th' Almighty's subsequent command,\r\n  His first command is this:--\"Man, love thyself.\"                   170\r\n  In this alone, free agents are not free.\r\n  Existence is the basis, bliss the prize;\r\n  If virtue costs existence, 'tis a crime;\r\n  Bold violation of our law supreme,\r\n  Black suicide; though nations, which consult\r\n  Their gain, at thy expence, resound applause.\r\n    Since Virtue's recompence is doubtful, here,\r\n  If man dies wholly, well may we demand,\r\n  Why is man suffer'd to be good in vain?\r\n  Why to be good in vain, is man enjoin'd?                           180\r\n  Why to be good in vain, is man betray'd?\r\n  Betray'd by traitors lodged in his own breast,\r\n  By sweet complacencies from virtue felt?\r\n  Why whispers Nature lies on Virtue's part?\r\n  Or if blind Instinct (which assumes the name\r\n  Of sacred conscience) plays the fool in man,\r\n  Why Reason made accomplice in the cheat?\r\n  Why are the wisest loudest in her praise?\r\n  Can man by Reason's beam be led astray?\r\n  Or, at his peril, imitate his God?                                 190\r\n  Since virtue sometimes ruins us on earth,\r\n  Or both are true, or man survives the grave.\r\n    Or man survives the grave, or own, Lorenzo,\r\n  Thy boast supreme, a wild absurdity.\r\n  Dauntless thy spirit; cowards are thy scorn.\r\n  Grant man immortal, and thy scorn is just.\r\n  The man immortal, rationally brave,\r\n  Dares rush on death--because he cannot die.\r\n  But if man loses all, when life is lost,\r\n  He lives a coward, or a fool expires.                              200\r\n  A daring infidel (and such there are,\r\n  From pride, example, lucre, rage, revenge,\r\n  Or pure heroical defect of thought),                               203\r\n  Of all earth's madmen, most deserves a chain.\r\n    When to the grave we follow the renown'd\r\n  For valour, virtue, science, all we love,\r\n  And all we praise; for worth, whose noontide beam,\r\n  Enabling us to think in higher style,\r\n  Mends our ideas of ethereal powers;\r\n  Dream we, that lustre of the moral world                           210\r\n  Goes out in stench, and rottenness the close?\r\n  Why was he wise to know, and warm to praise,\r\n  And strenuous to transcribe, in human life,\r\n  The Mind Almighty? Could it be, that Fate,\r\n  Just when the lineaments began to shine,\r\n  And dawn the Deity, should snatch the draught,\r\n  With night eternal blot it out, and give\r\n  The skies alarm, lest angels too might die?\r\n    If human souls, why not angelic too\r\n  Extinguish'd? and a solitary God,                                  220\r\n  O'er ghastly ruin, frowning from his throne?\r\n  Shall we this moment gaze on God in man?\r\n  The next, lose man for ever in the dust?\r\n  From dust we disengage, or man mistakes;\r\n  And there, where least his judgment fears a flaw.\r\n  Wisdom and worth, how boldly he commends!\r\n  Wisdom and worth, are sacred names; revered,\r\n  Where not embraced; applauded; deified;\r\n  Why not compassion'd too? If spirits die,\r\n  Both are calamities, inflicted both,                               230\r\n  To make us but more wretched: Wisdom's eye\r\n  Acute, for what? to spy more miseries;\r\n  And worth, so recompensed, new-points their stings.\r\n  Or man surmounts the grave, or gain is loss,\r\n  And worth exalted humbles us the more.\r\n  Thou wilt not patronise a scheme that makes                        236\r\n  Weakness and vice the refuge of mankind.\r\n    \"Has virtue, then, no joys?\"--Yes, joys dear-bought.\r\n  Talk ne'er so long, in this imperfect state,\r\n  Virtue and vice are at eternal war,\r\n  Virtue's a combat; and who fights for nought?\r\n  Or for precarious, or for small reward?\r\n  Who virtue's self-reward so loud resound,                          243\r\n  Would take degrees angelic here below,\r\n  And virtue, while they compliment, betray,\r\n  By feeble motives, and unfaithful guards.\r\n  The crown, th' unfading crown, her soul inspires:\r\n  'Tis that, and that alone, can countervail\r\n  The body's treacheries, and the world's assaults:\r\n  On earth's poor pay our famish'd virtue dies.                      250\r\n  Truth incontestible! in spite of all\r\n  A Bayle has preach'd, or a Voltaire believed.\r\n    In man the more we dive, the more we see\r\n  Heaven's signet stamping an immortal make.\r\n  Dive to the bottom of his soul, the base\r\n  Sustaining all; what find we? knowledge, love.\r\n  As light and heat, essential to the sun,\r\n  These to the soul. And why, if souls expire?\r\n  How little lovely here? how little known?\r\n  Small knowledge we dig up with endless toil;                       260\r\n  And love unfeign'd may purchase perfect hate.\r\n  Why starved, on earth, our angel appetites;\r\n  While brutal are indulged their fulsome fill?\r\n  Were then capacities divine conferr'd,\r\n  As a mock-diadem, in savage sport,\r\n  Rank insult of our pompous poverty,\r\n  Which reaps but pain, from seeming claims so fair?\r\n  In future age lies no redress? and shuts\r\n  Eternity the door on our complaint?\r\n  If so, for what strange ends were mortals made!                    270\r\n  The worst to wallow, and the best to weep;\r\n  The man who merits most, must most complain:\r\n  Can we conceive a disregard in heaven,\r\n  What the worst perpetrate, or best endure?\r\n    This cannot be. To love, and know, in man\r\n  Is boundless appetite, and boundless power;\r\n  And these demonstrate boundless objects too.\r\n  Objects, powers, appetites, Heaven suits in all;\r\n  Nor, nature through, e'er violates this sweet,\r\n  Eternal concord, on her tuneful string.                            280\r\n  Is Man the sole exception from her laws?\r\n  Eternity struck off from human hope\r\n  (I speak with truth, but veneration too),\r\n  Man is a monster, the reproach of Heaven,\r\n  A stain, a dark impenetrable cloud\r\n  On Nature's beauteous aspect; and deforms\r\n  (Amazing blot!), deforms her with her lord.\r\n  If such is man's allotment, what is heaven?\r\n  Or own the soul immortal, or blaspheme.\r\n    Or own the soul immortal, or invert                              290\r\n  All order. Go, mock-majesty! go, man!\r\n  And bow to thy superiors of the stall;\r\n  Through every scene of sense superior far:\r\n  They graze the turf untill'd; they drink the stream\r\n  Unbrew'd, and ever full, and unembitter'd\r\n  With doubts, fears, fruitless hopes, regrets, despairs;\r\n  Mankind's peculiar! reason's precious dower!\r\n  No foreign clime they ransack for their robes;\r\n  Nor brothers cite to the litigious bar;\r\n  Their good is good entire, unmix'd, unmarr'd;                      300\r\n  They find a paradise in every field,\r\n  On boughs forbidden where no curses hang:\r\n  Their ill no more than strikes the sense; unstretch'd\r\n  By previous dread, or murmur in the rear:                          304\r\n  When the worst comes, it comes unfear'd; one stroke\r\n  Begins, and ends, their woe: they die but once;\r\n  Bless'd, incommunicable privilege! for which\r\n  Proud man, who rules the globe, and reads the stars,\r\n  Philosopher, or hero, sighs in vain.\r\n    Account for this prerogative in brutes.\r\n  No day, no glimpse of day, to solve the knot,\r\n  But what beams on it from eternity.                                312\r\n  O sole and sweet solution! that unties\r\n  The difficult, and softens the severe;\r\n  The cloud on nature's beauteous face dispels;\r\n  Restores bright order; casts the brute beneath;\r\n  And re-enthrones us in supremacy\r\n  Of joy, even here: admit immortal life,\r\n  And virtue is knight-errantry no more;\r\n  Each virtue brings in hand a golden dower,                         320\r\n  Far richer in reversion: Hope exults;\r\n  And though much bitter in our cup is thrown,\r\n  Predominates, and gives the taste of heaven.\r\n  O wherefore is the Deity so kind?\r\n  Astonishing beyond astonishment!\r\n  Heaven our reward--for heaven enjoy'd below.\r\n    Still unsubdued thy stubborn heart?--for there\r\n  The traitor lurks who doubts the truth I sing.\r\n  Reason is guiltless; will alone rebels.\r\n  What, in that stubborn heart, if I should find                     330\r\n  New, unexpected witnesses against thee?\r\n  Ambition, pleasure, and the love of gain!\r\n  Canst thou suspect that these, which make the soul\r\n  The slave of earth, should own her heir of heaven?\r\n  Canst thou suspect what makes us disbelieve\r\n  Our immortality, should prove it sure?\r\n    First, then, Ambition summon to the bar.\r\n  Ambition's shame, extravagance, disgust                            338\r\n  And inextinguishable nature, speak.\r\n  Each much deposes; hear them in their turn.\r\n    Thy soul, how passionately fond of fame!\r\n  How anxious, that fond passion to conceal!\r\n  We blush, detected in designs on praise,\r\n  Though for best deeds, and from the best of men:\r\n  And why? Because immortal. Art divine\r\n  Has made the body tutor to the soul;\r\n  Heaven kindly gives our blood a moral flow;\r\n  Bids it ascend the glowing cheek, and there\r\n  Upbraid that little heart's inglorious aim,\r\n  Which stoops to court a character from man;                        350\r\n  While o'er us, in tremendous judgment sit\r\n  Far more than man, with endless praise, and blame.\r\n    Ambition's boundless appetite outspeaks\r\n  The verdict of its shame. When souls take fire\r\n  At high presumptions of their own desert,\r\n  One age is poor applause; the mighty shout,\r\n  The thunder by the living few begun,\r\n  Late time must echo; worlds unborn resound.\r\n  We wish our names eternally to live:\r\n  Wild dream! which ne'er had haunted human thought,\r\n  Had not our natures been eternal too.                              361\r\n  Instinct points out an interest in hereafter;\r\n  But our blind reason sees not where it lies;\r\n  Or, seeing, gives the substance for the shade.\r\n    Fame is the shade of immortality,\r\n  And in itself a shadow. Soon as caught,\r\n  Contemn'd; it shrinks to nothing in the grasp.\r\n  Consult th' ambitious, 'tis ambition's cure.\r\n  \"And is this all?\" cried Caesar at his height,\r\n  Disgusted. This third proof Ambition brings                        370\r\n  Of immortality. The first in fame.\r\n  Observe him near, your envy will abate:                            372\r\n  Shamed at the disproportion vast, between\r\n  The passion and the purchase, he will sigh\r\n  At such success, and blush at his renown.\r\n  And why? Because far richer prize invites\r\n  His heart; far more illustrious glory calls:\r\n  It calls in whispers, yet the deafest hear.\r\n    And can Ambition a fourth proof supply?\r\n  It can, and stronger than the former three;                        380\r\n  Yet quite o'erlook'd by some reputed wise.\r\n  Though disappointments in ambition pain,\r\n  And though success disgusts; yet still, Lorenzo!\r\n  In vain we strive to pluck it from our hearts;\r\n  By Nature planted for the noblest ends.\r\n  Absurd the famed advice to Pyrrhus[34] given,\r\n  More praised, than ponder'd; specious, but unsound;\r\n  Sooner that hero's sword the world had quell'd,\r\n  Than Reason, his ambition. Man must soar.\r\n  An obstinate activity within,                                      390\r\n  An insuppressive spring, will toss him up\r\n  In spite of Fortune's load. Not kings alone,\r\n  Each villager has his ambition too;\r\n  No Sultan prouder than his fetter'd slave:\r\n  Slaves build their little Babylons of straw,\r\n  Echo the proud Assyrian, in their hearts,\r\n  And cry,--\"Behold the wonders of my might!\"\r\n  And why? Because immortal as their lord;\r\n  And souls immortal must for ever heave\r\n  At something great; the glitter, or the gold;                      400\r\n  The praise of mortals, or the praise of Heaven.\r\n    Nor absolutely vain is human praise,\r\n  When human is supported by divine.\r\n  I'll introduce Lorenzo to himself;                                 404\r\n  Pleasure and Pride (bad masters!) share our hearts.\r\n  As love of pleasure is ordain'd to guard\r\n  And feed our bodies, and extend our race;\r\n  The love of praise is planted to protect,\r\n  And propagate the glories of the mind.\r\n  What is it, but the love of praise, inspires,\r\n  Matures, refines, embellishes, exalts,\r\n  Earth's happiness? From that, the delicate,                        412\r\n  The grand, the marvellous, of civil life,\r\n  Want and convenience, underworkers, lay\r\n  The basis, on which love of glory builds.\r\n  Nor is thy life, O Virtue! less in debt\r\n  To praise, thy secret stimulating friend.\r\n  Were men not proud, what merit should we miss!\r\n  Pride made the virtues of the Pagan world.\r\n  Praise is the salt that seasons right to man,                      420\r\n  And whets his appetite for moral good.\r\n  Thirst of applause is Virtue's second guard;\r\n  Reason, her first; but reason wants an aid;\r\n  Our private reason is a flatterer;\r\n  Thirst of applause calls public judgment in,\r\n  To poise our own, to keep an even scale,\r\n  And give endanger'd Virtue fairer play.\r\n    Here a fifth proof arises, stronger still:\r\n  Why this so nice construction of our hearts?\r\n  These delicate moralities of sense;                                430\r\n  This constitutional reserve of aid\r\n  To succour virtue, when our reason fails;\r\n  If virtue, kept alive by care and toil,\r\n  And oft, the mark of injuries on earth,\r\n  When labour'd to maturity (its bill\r\n  Of disciplines, and pains, unpaid), must die?\r\n  Why freighted rich, to dash against a rock?\r\n  Were man to perish when most fit to live,                          438\r\n  O how misspent were all these stratagems,\r\n  By skill divine inwoven in our frame!\r\n  Where are Heaven's holiness and mercy fled?\r\n  Laughs Heaven, at once, at Virtue, and at Man?\r\n  If not, why that discouraged, this destroy'd?\r\n    Thus far Ambition. What says Avarice?\r\n  This her chief maxim, which has long been thine:\r\n  \"The wise and wealthy are the same,\"--I grant it.\r\n  To store up treasure with incessant toil,\r\n  This is man's province, this his highest praise.\r\n  To this great end keen Instinct stings him on.\r\n  To guide that instinct, Reason! is thy charge;                     450\r\n  'Tis thine to tell us where true treasure lies:\r\n  But, Reason failing to discharge her trust,\r\n  Or to the deaf discharging it in vain,\r\n  A blunder follows; and blind Industry,\r\n  Gall'd by the spur, but stranger to the course\r\n  (The course where stakes of more than gold are won),\r\n  O'erloading, with the cares of distant age,\r\n  The jaded spirits of the present hour,\r\n  Provides for an eternity below.\r\n    \"Thou shalt not covet,\" is a wise command;                       460\r\n  But bounded to the wealth the sun surveys:\r\n  Look farther, the command stands quite reversed,\r\n  And avarice is a virtue most divine.\r\n  Is faith a refuge for our happiness?\r\n  Most sure: and is it not for reason too?\r\n  Nothing this world unriddles, but the next.\r\n  Whence inextinguishable thirst of gain?\r\n  From inextinguishable life in man.\r\n  Man, if not meant, by worth, to reach the skies,\r\n  Had wanted wing to fly so far in guilt.                            470\r\n  Sour grapes, I grant, ambition, avarice,\r\n  Yet still their root is immortality:                               472\r\n  These its wild growths so bitter, and so base,\r\n  (Pain and reproach!) Religion can reclaim,\r\n  Refine, exalt, throw down their poisonous lee,\r\n  And make them sparkle in the bowl of bliss.\r\n    See, the third witness laughs at bliss remote,\r\n  And falsely promises an Eden here:\r\n  Truth she shall speak for once, though prone to lie,\r\n  A common cheat, and Pleasure is her name.                          480\r\n  To Pleasure never was Lorenzo deaf;\r\n  Then hear her now, now first thy real friend.\r\n    Since Nature made us not more fond than proud\r\n  Of happiness (whence hypocrites in joy!\r\n  Makers of mirth! artificers of smiles!),\r\n  Why should the joy most poignant sense affords,\r\n  Burn us with blushes, and rebuke our pride?--\r\n  Those heaven-born blushes tell us man descends,\r\n  Even in the zenith of his earthly bliss:\r\n  Should Reason take her infidel repose,                             490\r\n  This honest instinct speaks our lineage high;\r\n  This instinct calls on darkness to conceal\r\n  Our rapturous relation to the stalls.\r\n  Our glory covers us with noble shame,\r\n  And he that's unconfounded, is unmann'd.\r\n  The man that blushes, is not quite a brute.\r\n  Thus far with thee, Lorenzo, will I close:\r\n  Pleasure is good, and man for pleasure made;\r\n  But pleasure full of glory, as of joy;\r\n  Pleasure, which neither blushes, nor expires.                      500\r\n    The witnesses are heard; the cause is o'er;\r\n  Let Conscience file the sentence in her court,\r\n  Dearer than deeds that half a realm convey;\r\n  Thus seal'd by Truth, th' authentic record runs:\r\n    \"Know all; know, infidels,--unapt to know!\r\n  'Tis immortality your nature solves;                               506\r\n  'Tis immortality deciphers man,\r\n  And opens all the mysteries of his make.\r\n  Without it, half his instincts are a riddle;\r\n  Without it, all his virtues are a dream.\r\n  His very crimes attest his dignity;\r\n  His sateless thirst of pleasure, gold, and fame,\r\n  Declares him born for blessings infinite:                          513\r\n  What less than infinite makes unabsurd\r\n  Passions, which all on earth but more inflames?\r\n  Fierce passions, so mismeasured to this scene,\r\n  Stretch'd out, like eagles' wings, beyond our nest,\r\n  Far, far beyond the worth of all below,\r\n  For earth too large, presage a nobler flight,\r\n  And evidence our title to the skies.\"                              520\r\n    Ye gentle theologues, of calmer kind!\r\n  Whose constitution dictates to your pen,\r\n  Who, cold yourselves, think ardour comes from hell!\r\n  Think not our passions from Corruption sprung,\r\n  Though to Corruption now they lend their wings;\r\n  That is their mistress, not their mother.

The soul's high price\r\n  Is writ in all the conduct of the skies.\r\n  The soul's high price is the creation's key,\r\n  Unlocks its mysteries, and naked lays\r\n  The genuine cause of every deed divine:\r\n  That is the chain of ages, which maintains\r\n  Their obvious correspondence, and unites\r\n  Most distant periods in one bless'd design:\r\n  That is the mighty hinge, on which have turn'd\r\n  All revolutions, whether we regard                                1020\r\n  The natural, civil, or religious, world;\r\n  The former two but servants to the third:\r\n  To that their duty done, they both expire,\r\n  Their mass new-cast, forgot their deeds renown'd;\r\n  And angels ask, \"Where once they shone so fair?\"\r\n    To lift us from this abject, to sublime;\r\n  This flux, to permanent; this dark, to day;\r\n  This foul, to pure; this turbid, to serene;\r\n  This mean, to mighty!--for this glorious end\r\n  Th' Almighty, rising, his long Sabbath broke!                     1030\r\n  The world was made; was ruin'd; was restored;\r\n  Laws from the skies were publish'd; were repeal'd;\r\n  On earth, kings, kingdoms, rose; kings, kingdoms, fell;\r\n  Famed sages lighted up the Pagan world;\r\n  Prophets from Sion darted a keen glance\r\n  Through distant age; saints travell'd; martyrs bled;\r\n  By wonders sacred nature stood controll'd;\r\n  The living were translated; dead were raised;\r\n  Angels, and more than angels, came from heaven;\r\n  And, oh! for this, descended lower still;                         1040\r\n  Guilt was hell's gloom; astonish'd at his guest,\r\n  For one short moment Lucifer adored:\r\n  Lorenzo! and wilt thou do less?--For this,\r\n  That hallow'd page, fools scoff at, was inspired,                 1044\r\n  Of all these truths thrice venerable code!\r\n  Deists! perform your quarantine; and then\r\n  Fall prostrate, ere you touch it, lest you die.\r\n    Nor less intensely bent infernal powers\r\n  To mar, than those of light, this end to gain.\r\n  Oh, what a scene is here!--Lorenzo, wake!\r\n  Rise to the thought; exert, expand thy soul\r\n  To take the vast idea: it denies                                  1052\r\n  All else the name of great.

How strongly strikes\r\n  Immortal life's full demonstration, here!\r\n  Why this exertion? Why this strange regard\r\n  From heaven's Omnipotent indulged to man?--\r\n  Because, in man, the glorious dreadful power,\r\n  Extremely to be pain'd, or bless'd, for ever.\r\n  Duration gives importance; swells the price\r\n  An angel, if a creature of a day,\r\n  What would he be? a trifle of no weight;                          1090\r\n  Or stand, or fall; no matter which; he's gone.\r\n  Because immortal, therefore is indulged\r\n  This strange regard of deities to dust.\r\n  Hence, Heaven looks down on earth with all her eyes;\r\n  Hence, the soul's mighty moment in her sight:\r\n  Hence, every soul has partisans above,\r\n  And every thought a critic in the skies:\r\n  Hence, clay, vile clay! has angels for its guard,\r\n  And every guard a passion for his charge:\r\n  Hence, from all age, the cabinet divine                           1100\r\n  Has held high counsel o'er the fate of man.\r\n    Nor have the clouds those gracious counsels hid,\r\n  Angels undrew the curtain of the throne,\r\n  And Providence came forth to meet mankind:\r\n  In various modes of emphasis and awe,\r\n  He spoke his will, and trembling Nature heard;\r\n  He spoke it loud, in thunder and in storm.\r\n  Witness, thou Sinai! whose cloud-cover'd height,\r\n  And shaken basis, own'd the present God:\r\n  Witness, ye billows! whose returning tide,                        1110\r\n  Breaking the chain that fasten'd it in air,\r\n  Swept Egypt, and her menaces, to hell:                            1112\r\n  Witness, ye flames! th' Assyrian tyrant blew\r\n  To sevenfold rage, as impotent, as strong:\r\n  And thou, earth! witness, whose expanding jaws\r\n  Closed o'er Presumption's sacrilegious sons:[38]\r\n  Has not each element, in turn, subscribed\r\n  The soul's high price, and sworn it to the wise?\r\n  Has not flame, ocean, ether, earthquake, strove\r\n  To strike this truth, through adamantine man?                     1120\r\n  If not all-adamant, Lorenzo! hear;\r\n  All is delusion; Nature is wrapt up,\r\n  In tenfold night, from Reason's keenest eye;\r\n  There's no consistence, meaning, plan, or end,\r\n  In all beneath the sun, in all above\r\n  (As far as man can penetrate), or heaven\r\n  Is an immense, inestimable prize;\r\n  Or all is nothing, or that prize is all.--\r\n  And shall each toy be still a match for Heaven,\r\n  And full equivalent for groans below?                             1130\r\n  Who would not give a trifle to prevent\r\n  What he would give a thousand worlds to cure?\r\n    Lorenzo! thou hast seen (if thine to see)\r\n  All nature, and her God (by nature's course,\r\n  And nature's course controll'd), declare for me:\r\n  The skies above proclaim, \"Immortal man!\"\r\n  And, \"Man immortal!\" all below resounds.\r\n  The world's a system of theology,\r\n  Read by the greatest strangers to the schools:\r\n  If honest, learn'd; and sages o'er a plough.                      1140\r\n  Is not, Lorenzo, then, imposed on thee\r\n  This hard alternative; or, to renounce\r\n  Thy reason, or thy sense; or, to believe?\r\n  What then is unbelief? 'Tis an exploit;\r\n  A strenuous enterprise: to gain it, man                           1145\r\n  Must burst through every bar of common sense,\r\n  Of common shame, magnanimously wrong:\r\n  And what rewards the sturdy combatant?\r\n  His prize, repentance; infamy, his crown.\r\n    But wherefore infamy?--For want of faith,\r\n  Down the steep precipice of wrong he slides;\r\n  There's nothing to support him in the right.                      1152\r\n  Faith in the future wanting, is, at least\r\n  In embryo, every weakness, every guilt;\r\n  And strong temptation ripens it to birth.\r\n  If this life's gain invites him to the deed,\r\n  Why not his country sold, his father slain?\r\n  'Tis virtue to pursue our good supreme;\r\n  And his supreme, his only good, is here.\r\n  Ambition, avarice, by the wise disdain'd,                         1160\r\n  Is perfect wisdom, while mankind are fools,\r\n  And think a turf, or tombstone, covers all:\r\n  These find employment, and provide for Sense\r\n  A richer pasture, and a larger range;\r\n  And Sense by right divine ascends the throne,\r\n  When Virtue's prize and prospect are no more;\r\n  Virtue no more we think the will of Heaven.\r\n  Would Heaven quite beggar Virtue, if beloved?\r\n    \"Has Virtue charms?\"--I grant her heavenly fair;\r\n  But if unportion'd, all will Interest wed;                        1170\r\n  Though that our admiration, this our choice.\r\n  The virtues grow on immortality;\r\n  That root destroy'd, they wither and expire.\r\n  A Deity believed, will nought avail;\r\n  Rewards and punishments make God adored;\r\n  And hopes and fears give Conscience all her power.\r\n    As in the dying parent dies the child,\r\n  Virtue, with immortality, expires.\r\n  Who tells me he denies his soul immortal,                         1179\r\n  Whate'er his boast, has told me, he's a knave.\r\n  His duty 'tis, to love himself alone;\r\n  Nor care though mankind perish, if he smiles.\r\n  Who thinks ere long the man shall wholly die,\r\n  Is dead already; nought but brute survives.\r\n    And are there such?--Such candidates there are\r\n  For more than death; for utter loss of being,\r\n  Being, the basis of the Deity!\r\n  Ask you the cause?--The cause they will not tell:\r\n  Nor need they: oh the sorceries of Sense!\r\n  They work this transformation on the soul;                        1190\r\n  Dismount her, like the serpent at the fall,\r\n  Dismount her from her native wing (which soar'd\r\n  Erewhile ethereal heights), and throw her down,\r\n  To lick the dust, and crawl in such a thought.\r\n    Is it in words to paint you?

'tis self-love in her wits,\r\n  Quite skilful in the market of delight.\r\n  Self-love's good sense is love of that dread Power,                890\r\n  From whom herself, and all she can enjoy.\r\n  Other self-love is but disguised self-hate;\r\n  More mortal than the malice of our foes;\r\n  A self-hate, now, scarce felt; then felt full sore,\r\n  When being, cursed; extinction, loud implored;\r\n  And every thing preferr'd to what we are.\r\n    Yet this self-love Lorenzo makes his choice;\r\n  And, in this choice triumphant, boasts of joy.\r\n  How is his want of happiness betray'd,                             899\r\n  By disaffection to the present hour!\r\n  Imagination wanders far afield:\r\n  The future pleases: why? the present pains.--\r\n  \"But that's a secret.\" Yes, which all men know;\r\n  And know from thee, discover'd unawares.\r\n  Thy ceaseless agitation, restless roll\r\n  From cheat to cheat, impatient of a pause;\r\n  What is it?--'tis the cradle of the soul,\r\n  From Instinct sent, to rock her in disease,\r\n  Which her physician, Reason, will not cure.\r\n  A poor expedient! yet thy best; and while                          910\r\n  It mitigates thy pain, it owns it too.\r\n    Such are Lorenzo's wretched remedies!\r\n  The weak have remedies; the wise have joys.\r\n  Superior wisdom is superior bliss.\r\n  And what sure mark distinguishes the wise?\r\n  Consistent wisdom ever wills the same;\r\n  Thy fickle wish is ever on the wing.\r\n  Sick of herself, is Folly's character,\r\n  As Wisdom's is, a modest self-applause.\r\n  A change of evils is thy good supreme;                             920\r\n  Nor, but in motion, canst thou find thy rest.\r\n  Man's greatest strength is shown in standing still.\r\n  The first sure symptom of a mind in health,\r\n  Is rest of heart, and pleasure felt at home.\r\n  False pleasure from abroad her joys imports;\r\n  Rich from within, and self-sustain'd, the true.\r\n  The true is fix'd, and solid as a rock;\r\n  Slippery the false, and tossing, as the wave.\r\n  This, a wild wanderer on earth, like Cain;\r\n  That, like the fabled, self-enamour'd boy,[48]                     930\r\n  Home-contemplation her supreme delight;\r\n  She dreads an interruption from without,                           932\r\n  Smit with her own condition; and the more\r\n  Intense she gazes, still it charms the more.\r\n    No man is happy, till he thinks, on earth\r\n  There breathes not a more happy than himself:\r\n  Then envy dies, and love o'erflows on all;\r\n  And love o'erflowing makes an angel here.\r\n  Such angels, all, entitled to repose\r\n  On Him who governs fate. Though tempest frowns,                    940\r\n  Though nature shakes, how soft to lean on Heaven!\r\n  To lean on Him, on whom archangels lean!\r\n  With inward eyes, and silent as the grave,\r\n  They stand, collecting every beam of thought,\r\n  Till their hearts kindle with divine delight:\r\n  For all their thoughts, like angels, seen of old\r\n  In Israel's dream, come from, and go to, heaven.\r\n  Hence are they studious of sequester'd scenes;\r\n  While noise, and dissipation, comfort thee.\r\n    Were all men happy, revellings would cease,                      950\r\n  That opiate for inquietude within.\r\n  Lorenzo! never man was truly blest,\r\n  But it composed, and gave him such a cast,\r\n  As folly might mistake for want of joy.\r\n  A cast, unlike the triumph of the proud;\r\n  A modest aspect, and a smile at heart.\r\n  O for a joy from thy Philander's spring!\r\n  A spring perennial, rising in the breast,\r\n  And permanent, as pure! no turbid stream\r\n  Of rapturous exultation, swelling high;                            960\r\n  Which, like land floods, impetuous pour a while,\r\n  Then sink at once, and leave us in the mire.\r\n  What does the man, who transient joy prefers?\r\n  What, but prefer the bubbles to the stream?\r\n    Vain are all sudden sallies of delight;\r\n  Convulsions of a weak, distemper'd joy.                            966\r\n  Joy's a fix'd state; a tenure, not a start.\r\n  Bliss there is none, but unprecarious bliss:\r\n  That is the gem: sell all, and purchase that.\r\n  Why go a-begging to contingencies,\r\n  Not gain'd with ease, nor safely loved, if gain'd?\r\n  At good fortuitous, draw back, and pause;\r\n  Suspect it; what thou canst insure, enjoy;                         973\r\n  And nought but what thou givest thyself, is sure.\r\n  Reason perpetuates joy that Reason gives,\r\n  And makes it as immortal as herself:\r\n  To mortals, nought immortal, but their worth.\r\n    Worth, conscious worth! should absolutely reign;\r\n  And other joys ask leave for their approach;\r\n  Nor, unexamined, ever leave obtain.                                980\r\n  Thou art all anarchy; a mob of joys\r\n  Wage war, and perish in intestine broils;\r\n  Not the least promise of internal peace!\r\n  No bosom-comfort, or unborrow'd bliss!\r\n  Thy thoughts are vagabonds; all outward-bound,\r\n  'Mid sands, and rocks, and storms, to cruise for pleasure;\r\n  If gain'd, dear-bought; and better miss'd than gain'd.\r\n  Much pain must expiate, what much pain procured.\r\n  Fancy, and Sense, from an infected shore,\r\n  Thy cargo bring; and pestilence the prize.                         990\r\n  Then, such thy thirst (insatiable thirst!\r\n  By fond indulgence but inflamed the more!),\r\n  Fancy still cruises, when poor Sense is tired.\r\n    Imagination is the Paphian shop,\r\n  Where feeble happiness, like Vulcan, lame,\r\n  Bids foul ideas, in their dark recess,\r\n  And hot as hell (which kindled the black fires),\r\n  With wanton art, those fatal arrows form,\r\n  Which murder all thy time, health, wealth, and fame.\r\n  Would'st thou receive them, other thoughts there are,\r\n  On angel-wing, descending from above,                             1001\r\n  Which these, with art divine, would counterwork,\r\n  And form celestial armour for thy peace.\r\n    In this is seen Imagination's guilt;\r\n  But who can count her follies? She betrays thee,\r\n  To think in grandeur there is something great.\r\n  For works of curious art, and ancient fame,\r\n  Thy genius hungers, elegantly pain'd;\r\n  And foreign climes must cater for thy taste.\r\n  Hence, what disaster!--Though the price was paid,                 1010\r\n  That persecuting priest, the Turk of Rome,\r\n  Whose foot (ye gods!) though cloven, must be kiss'd,\r\n  Detain'd thy dinner on the Latian shore;\r\n  (Such is the fate of honest Protestants!)\r\n  And poor Magnificence is starved to death.\r\n  Hence just resentment, indignation, ire!--\r\n  Be pacified: if outward things are great,\r\n  'Tis magnanimity great things to scorn;\r\n  Pompous expenses, and parades august,\r\n  And courts, that insalubrious soil to peace.                      1020\r\n  True happiness ne'er enter'd at an eye;\r\n  True happiness resides in things unseen.\r\n  No smiles of Fortune ever bless'd the bad,\r\n  Nor can her frowns rob Innocence of joys;\r\n  That jewel wanting, triple crowns are poor:\r\n  So tell his Holiness, and be revenged.\r\n    Pleasure, we both agree, is man's chief good;\r\n  Our only contest, what deserves the name.\r\n  Give Pleasure's name to nought, but what has pass'd\r\n  Th' authentic seal of Reason (which like Yorke,[49]               1030\r\n  Demurs on what it passes), and defies\r\n  The tooth of time; when past, a pleasure still;\r\n  Dearer on trial, lovelier for its age,                            1033\r\n  And doubly to be prized, as it promotes\r\n  Our future, while it forms our present, joy.\r\n  Some joys the future overcast; and some\r\n  Throw all their beams that way, and gild the tomb.\r\n  Some joys endear eternity; some give\r\n  Abhorr'd annihilation dreadful charms.\r\n  Are rival joys contending for thy choice?                         1040\r\n  Consult thy whole existence, and be safe;\r\n  That oracle will put all doubt to flight.\r\n  Short is the lesson, though my lecture long;\r\n  Be good--and let Heaven answer for the rest.\r\n    Yet, with a sigh o'er all mankind, I grant\r\n  In this our day of proof, our land of hope,\r\n  The good man has his clouds that intervene;\r\n  Clouds, that obscure his sublunary day,\r\n  But never conquer: even the best must own,\r\n  Patience, and resignation, are the pillars                        1050\r\n  Of human peace on earth. The pillars, these:\r\n  But those of Seth not more remote from thee,\r\n  Till this heroic lesson thou hast learn'd;\r\n  To frown at pleasure, and to smile in pain.\r\n  Fired at the prospect of unclouded bliss,\r\n  Heaven in reversion, like the sun, as yet\r\n  Beneath th' horizon, cheers us in this world;\r\n  It sheds, on souls susceptible of light,\r\n  The glorious dawn of our eternal day.\r\n    \"This (says Lorenzo) is a fair harangue:                        1060\r\n  But can harangues blow back strong nature's stream;\r\n  Or stem the tide Heaven pushes through our veins,\r\n  Which sweeps away man's impotent resolves,\r\n  And lays his labour level with the world?\"\r\n    Themselves men make their comment on mankind;\r\n  And think nought is, but what they find at home:\r\n  Thus, weakness to chimera turns the truth.                        1067\r\n  Nothing romantic has the Muse prescribed.\r\n  Above,[50] Lorenzo saw the man of earth,\r\n  The mortal man; and wretched was the sight.\r\n  To balance that, to comfort, and exalt,\r\n  Now see the man immortal: him, I mean,\r\n  Who lives as such; whose heart, full bent on heaven,\r\n  Leans all that way, his bias to the stars.\r\n  The world's dark shades, in contrast set, shall raise\r\n  His lustre more; though bright, without a foil:\r\n  Observe his awful portrait, and admire;\r\n  Nor stop at wonder; imitate, and live.\r\n    Some angel guide my pencil, while I draw,\r\n  What nothing less than angel can exceed!                          1080\r\n  A man on earth devoted to the skies;\r\n  Like ships in sea, while in, above the world.\r\n    With aspect mild, and elevated eye,\r\n  Behold him seated on a mount serene,\r\n  Above the fogs of sense, and passion's storm;\r\n  All the black cares, and tumults, of this life,\r\n  Like harmless thunders, breaking at his feet,\r\n  Excite his pity, not impair his peace.\r\n  Earth's genuine sons, the sceptred, and the slave,\r\n  A mingled mob! a wandering herd! he sees,                         1090\r\n  Bewilder'd in the vale; in all unlike!\r\n  His full reverse in all! What higher praise?\r\n  What stronger demonstration of the right?\r\n    The present all their care; the future, his.\r\n  When public welfare calls, or private want,\r\n  They give to fame; his bounty he conceals.\r\n  Their virtues varnish nature; his exalt.\r\n  Mankind's esteem they court; and he, his own.\r\n  Theirs, the wild chase of false felicities;\r\n  His, the composed possession of the true.                         1100\r\n  Alike throughout is his consistent peace,\r\n  All of one colour, and an even thread;\r\n  While party-colour'd shreds of happiness,\r\n  With hideous gaps between, patch up for them\r\n  A madman's robe; each puff of Fortune blows\r\n  The tatters by, and shows their nakedness.\r\n    He sees with other eyes than theirs: where they\r\n  Behold a sun, he spies a Deity;\r\n  What makes them only smile, makes him adore.\r\n  Where they see mountains, he but atoms sees;                      1110\r\n  An empire, in his balance, weighs a grain.\r\n  They things terrestrial worship, as divine:\r\n  His hopes immortal blow them by, as dust,\r\n  That dims his sight, and shortens his survey,\r\n  Which longs, in infinite, to lose all bound.\r\n  Titles and honours (if they prove his fate)\r\n  He lays aside to find his dignity;\r\n  No dignity they find in aught besides.\r\n  They triumph in externals (which conceal\r\n  Man's real glory), proud of an eclipse.                           1120\r\n  Himself too much he prizes to be proud,\r\n  And nothing thinks so great in man, as man.\r\n  Too dear he holds his interest, to neglect\r\n  Another's welfare, or his right invade;\r\n  Their interest, like a lion, lives on prey.\r\n  They kindle at the shadow of a wrong:\r\n  Wrong he sustains with temper, looks on heaven,\r\n  Nor stoops to think his injurer his foe;\r\n  Nought, but what wounds his virtue, wounds his peace.\r\n  A cover'd heart their character defends;                          1130\r\n  A cover'd heart denies him half his praise.\r\n  With nakedness his innocence agrees;\r\n  While their broad foliage testifies their fall:\r\n  Their no joys end, where his full feast begins;                   1134\r\n  His joys create, theirs murder, future bliss.\r\n  To triumph in existence, his alone;\r\n  And his alone, triumphantly to think\r\n  His true existence is not yet begun.\r\n  His glorious course was, yesterday, complete;\r\n  Death, then, was welcome; yet life still is sweet.\r\n    But nothing charms Lorenzo, like the firm,\r\n  Undaunted breast--and whose is that high praise?                  1142\r\n  They yield to pleasure, though they danger brave,\r\n  And show no fortitude, but in the field;\r\n  If there they show it, 'tis for glory shown;\r\n  Nor will that cordial always man their hearts.\r\n  A cordial his sustains, that cannot fail;\r\n  By pleasure unsubdued, unbroke by pain,\r\n  He shares in that Omnipotence he trusts.\r\n  All-bearing, all-attempting, till he falls;                       1150\r\n  And when he falls, writes VICI on his shield.\r\n  From magnanimity, all fear above;\r\n  From nobler recompence, above applause;\r\n  Which owes to man's short outlook all its charms.\r\n    Backward to credit what he never felt,\r\n  Lorenzo cries,--\"Where shines this miracle?\r\n  From what root rises this immortal man?\"\r\n  A root that grows not in Lorenzo's ground;\r\n  The root dissect, nor wonder at the flower.\r\n  He follows nature (not like thee) and shows us                    1160\r\n  An uninverted system of a man.\r\n  His appetite wears Reason's golden chain,\r\n  And finds, in due restraint, its luxury.\r\n  His passion, like an eagle well reclaim'd,\r\n  Is taught to fly at nought, but infinite.\r\n  Patient his hope, unanxious is his care,\r\n  His caution fearless, and his grief (if grief\r\n  The gods ordain) a stranger to despair.                           1168\r\n  And why?--because affection, more than meet,\r\n  His wisdom leaves not disengaged from heaven.\r\n  Those secondary goods that smile on earth,\r\n  He, loving in proportion, loves in peace.\r\n  They most the world enjoy, who least admire.\r\n  His understanding 'scapes the common cloud\r\n  Of fumes, arising from a boiling breast.\r\n  His head is clear, because his heart is cool,\r\n  By worldly competitions uninflamed.\r\n  The moderate movements of his soul admit\r\n  Distinct ideas, and matured debate,\r\n  An eye impartial, and an even scale;                              1180\r\n  Whence judgment sound, and unrepenting choice.\r\n  Thus, in a double sense, the good are wise;\r\n  On its own dunghill, wiser than the world.\r\n  What, then, the world? It must be doubly weak;\r\n  Strange truth! as soon would they believe their creed.\r\n    Yet thus it is; nor otherwise can be;\r\n  So far from aught romantic, what I sing.\r\n  Bliss has no being, virtue has no strength,\r\n  But from the prospect of immortal life.\r\n  Who think earth all, or (what weighs just the same)               1190\r\n  Who care no farther, must prize what it yields;\r\n  Fond of its fancies, proud of its parades.\r\n  Who thinks earth nothing, can't its charms admire;\r\n  He can't a foe, though most malignant, hate,\r\n  Because that hate would prove his greater foe.\r\n  'Tis hard for them (yet who so loudly boast\r\n  Good-will to men?) to love their dearest friend;\r\n  For may not he invade their good supreme,\r\n  Where the least jealousy turns love to gall?\r\n  All shines to them, that for a season shines.                     1200\r\n  Each act, each thought, he questions, \"What its weight,\r\n  Its colour what, a thousand ages hence?\"--                        1202\r\n  And what it there appears, he deems it now.\r\n  Hence, pure are the recesses of his soul.\r\n  The godlike man has nothing to conceal.\r\n  His virtue, constitutionally deep,\r\n  Has habit's firmness, and affection's flame;\r\n  Angels, allied, descend to feed the fire;\r\n  And Death, which others slays, makes him a god.\r\n    And now, Lorenzo! bigot of this world!                          1210\r\n  Wont to disdain poor bigots caught by Heaven!\r\n  Stand by thy scorn, and be reduced to nought:\r\n  For what art thou?--Thou boaster! while thy glare,\r\n  Thy gaudy grandeur, and mere worldly worth,\r\n  Like a broad mist, at distance, strikes us most;\r\n  And, like a mist, is nothing when at hand;\r\n  His merit, like a mountain, on approach,\r\n  Swells more, and rises nearer to the skies,\r\n  By promise now, and, by possession, soon,\r\n  (Too soon, too much, it cannot be) his own.                       1220\r\n    From this thy just annihilation rise,\r\n  Lorenzo! rise to something, by reply.\r\n  The world, thy client, listens, and expects;\r\n  And longs to crown thee with immortal praise.\r\n  Canst thou be silent? No; for Wit is thine;\r\n  And Wit talks most, when least she has to say,\r\n  And Reason interrupts not her career.\r\n  She'll say--that mists above the mountains rise;\r\n  And, with a thousand pleasantries, amuse;\r\n  She'll sparkle, puzzle, flutter, raise a dust,                    1230\r\n  And fly conviction, in the dust she raised.\r\n    Wit, how delicious to man's dainty taste!\r\n  'Tis precious, as the vehicle of sense;\r\n  But, as its substitute, a dire disease.\r\n  Pernicious talent! flatter'd by the world,\r\n  By the blind world, which thinks the talent rare.                 1236\r\n  Wisdom is rare, Lorenzo! wit abounds;\r\n  Passion can give it; sometimes wine inspires\r\n  The lucky flash; and madness rarely fails.\r\n  Whatever cause the spirit strongly stirs,\r\n  Confers the bays, and rivals thy renown.\r\n  For thy renown, 'twere well was this the worst;\r\n  Chance often hits it; and, to pique thee more,                    1243\r\n  See Dulness, blundering on vivacities,\r\n  Shakes her sage head at the calamity,\r\n  Which has exposed, and let her down to thee.\r\n  But Wisdom, awful Wisdom! which inspects,\r\n  Discerns, compares, weighs, separates, infers,\r\n  Seizes the right, and holds it to the last;\r\n  How rare! In senates, synods, sought in vain;                     1250\r\n  Or if there found, 'tis sacred to the few;\r\n  While a lewd prostitute to multitudes,\r\n  Frequent, as fatal, Wit: in civil life,\r\n  Wit makes an enterpriser; Sense, a man.\r\n  Wit hates authority; commotion loves,\r\n  And thinks herself the lightning of the storm.\r\n  In states, 'tis dangerous; in religion, death:\r\n  Shall Wit turn Christian, when the dull believe?\r\n  Sense is our helmet, wit is but the plume;\r\n  The plume exposes, 'tis our helmet saves.                         1260\r\n  Sense is the diamond, weighty, solid, sound;\r\n  When cut by wit, it casts a brighter beam;\r\n  Yet, wit apart, it is a diamond still.\r\n  Wit, widow'd of good sense, is worse than nought;\r\n  It hoists more sail to run against a rock.\r\n  Thus, a half-Chesterfield is quite a fool;\r\n  Whom dull fools scorn, and bless their want of wit.\r\n    How ruinous the rock I warn thee shun,\r\n  Where syrens sit, to sing thee to thy fate!\r\n  A joy, in which our reason bears no part,                         1270\r\n  Is but a sorrow, tickling, ere it stings.\r\n  Let not the cooings of the world allure thee;\r\n  Which of her lovers ever found her true?\r\n  Happy! of this bad world who little know?--\r\n  And yet, we much must know her, to be safe;\r\n  To know the world, not love her, is thy point;\r\n  She gives but little, nor that little, long.\r\n  There is, I grant, a triumph of the pulse;\r\n  A dance of spirits, a mere froth of joy,\r\n  Our thoughtless agitation's idle child,                           1280\r\n  That mantles high, that sparkles, and expires,\r\n  Leaving the soul more vapid than before.\r\n  An animal ovation! such as holds\r\n  No commerce with our reason, but subsists\r\n  On juices, through the well-toned tubes, well strain'd;\r\n  A nice machine! scarce ever tuned aright;\r\n  And when it jars--thy syrens sing no more,\r\n  Thy dance is done; the demi-god is thrown\r\n  (Short apotheosis!) beneath the man,\r\n  In coward gloom immersed, or fell despair.                        1290\r\n    Art thou yet dull enough despair to dread,\r\n  And startle at destruction? If thou art,\r\n  Accept a buckler, take it to the field;\r\n  (A field of battle is this mortal life!)\r\n  When danger threatens, lay it on thy heart;\r\n  A single sentence, proof against the world:\r\n  \"Soul, body, fortune!--every good pertains\r\n  To one of these; but prize not all alike;\r\n  The goods of fortune to thy body's health,\r\n  Body to soul, and soul submit to God.\"                            1300\r\n  Would'st thou build lasting happiness? do this;\r\n  Th' inverted pyramid can never stand.\r\n    Is this truth doubtful? It outshines the sun;\r\n  Nay, the sun shines not, but to show us this,                     1304\r\n  The single lesson of mankind on earth.\r\n  And yet--yet, what? No news! Mankind is mad;\r\n  Such mighty numbers list against the right,\r\n  (And what can't numbers, when bewitch'd, achieve!)\r\n  They talk themselves to something like belief,\r\n  That all earth's joys are theirs: as Athens' fool\r\n  Grinn'd from the port, on every sail his own.\r\n    They grin; but wherefore? and how long the laugh?\r\n  Half ignorance, their mirth; and half, a lie;                     1313\r\n  To cheat the world, and cheat themselves, they smile.\r\n  Hard either task! The most abandon'd own,\r\n  That others, if abandon'd, are undone:\r\n  Then, for themselves, the moment Reason wakes\r\n  (And Providence denies it long repose),\r\n  O how laborious is their gaiety!\r\n  They scarce can swallow their ebullient spleen,                   1320\r\n  Scarce muster patience to support the farce,\r\n  And pump sad laughter till the curtain falls.\r\n  Scarce, did I say? Some cannot sit it out;\r\n  Oft their own daring hands the curtain draw,\r\n  And show us what their joy, by their despair.\r\n    The clotted hair! gored breast! blaspheming eye!\r\n  Its impious fury still alive in death!\r\n  Shut, shut the shocking scene.--But Heaven denies\r\n  A cover to such guilt; and so should man.\r\n  Look round, Lorenzo! see the reeking blade,                       1330\r\n  Th' envenom'd phial, and the fatal ball;\r\n  The strangling cord, and suffocating stream;\r\n  The loathsome rottenness, and foul decays\r\n  From raging riot (slower suicides!)\r\n  And pride in these, more execrable still!\r\n  How horrid all to thought!--but horrors, these,\r\n  That vouch the truth; and aid my feeble song.\r\n    From vice, sense, fancy, no man can be blest:                   1338\r\n  Bliss is too great, to lodge within an hour:\r\n  When an immortal being aims at bliss,\r\n  Duration is essential to the name.\r\n  O for a joy from reason! joy from that,\r\n  Which makes man Man; and, exercised aright,\r\n  Will make him more: a bounteous joy! that gives\r\n  And promises; that weaves, with art divine,\r\n  The richest prospect into present peace:\r\n  A joy ambitious! joy in common held\r\n  With thrones ethereal, and their greater far;\r\n  A joy high privileged from chance, time, death!\r\n  A joy, which death shall double, judgment crown!                  1350\r\n  Crown'd higher, and still higher, at each stage,\r\n  Through bless'd eternity's long day; yet still,\r\n  Not more remote from sorrow, than from Him,\r\n  Whose lavish hand, whose love stupendous, pours\r\n  So much of Deity on guilty dust.\r\n  There, O my Lucia! may I meet thee there,\r\n  Where not thy presence can improve my bliss!\r\n    Affects not this the sages of the world?\r\n  Can nought affect them, but what fools them too?\r\n  Eternity, depending on an hour,                                   1360\r\n  Makes serious thought man's wisdom, joy, and praise,\r\n  Nor need you blush (though sometimes your designs\r\n  May shun the light) at your designs on heaven:\r\n  Sole point! where over-bashful is your blame.\r\n  Are you not wise?--You know you are: yet hear\r\n  One truth, amid your numerous schemes, mislaid,\r\n  Or overlook'd, or thrown aside, if seen;\r\n  \"Our schemes to plan by this world, or the next,\r\n  Is the sole difference between wise and fool.\"\r\n  All worthy men will weigh you in this scale;                      1370\r\n  What wonder then, if they pronounce you light?                    1371\r\n  Is their esteem alone not worth your care?\r\n  Accept my simple scheme of common sense:\r\n  Thus, save your fame, and make two worlds your own.\r\n    The world replies not;--but the world persists;\r\n  And puts the cause off to the longest day,\r\n  Planning evasions for the day of doom.\r\n  So far, at that re-hearing, from redress,\r\n  They then turn witnesses against themselves;\r\n  Hear that, Lorenzo! nor be wise to-morrow.                        1380\r\n  Haste, haste! a man, by nature, is in haste;\r\n  For who shall answer for another hour?\r\n  'Tis highly prudent, to make one sure friend;\r\n  And that thou canst not do, this side the skies.\r\n    Ye sons of earth! (nor willing to be more!)\r\n  Since verse you think from priestcraft somewhat free,\r\n  Thus, in an age so gay, the Muse plain truths\r\n  (Truths, which, at church, you might have heard in prose)\r\n  Has ventured into light; well pleased the verse\r\n  Should be forgot, if you the truths retain;                       1390\r\n  And crown her with your welfare, not your praise.\r\n  But praise she need not fear: I see my fate;\r\n  And headlong leap, like Curtius, down the gulf.\r\n  Since many an ample volume, mighty tome,\r\n  Must die; and die unwept; O thou minute\r\n  Devoted page! go forth among thy foes;\r\n  Go, nobly proud of martyrdom for truth,\r\n  And die a double death: mankind incensed,\r\n  Denies thee long to live: nor shalt thou rest,\r\n  When thou art dead; in Stygian shades arraign'd                   1400\r\n  By Lucifer, as traitor to his throne;\r\n  And bold blasphemer of his friend,--the World;\r\n  The World, whose legions cost him slender pay,\r\n  And volunteers around his banner swarm;                           1404\r\n  Prudent, as Prussia,[51] in her zeal for Gaul.\r\n    \"Are all, then, fools?\" Lorenzo cries.--Yes, all,\r\n  But such as hold this doctrine (new to thee);\r\n  \"The mother of true wisdom is the will;\"\r\n  The noblest intellect, a fool without it.\r\n  World-wisdom much has done, and more may do,                      1410\r\n  In arts and sciences, in wars, and peace:\r\n  But art and science, like thy wealth, will leave thee,\r\n  And make thee twice a beggar at thy death.\r\n  This is the most indulgence can afford;--\r\n  \"Thy wisdom all can do, but--make thee wise.\"\r\n  Nor think this censure is severe on thee;\r\n  Satan, thy master, I dare call a dunce.                           1417\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE CONSOLATION:\r\n                    CONTAINING, AMONG OTHER THINGS,\r\n              I. A MORAL SURVEY OF THE NOCTURNAL HEAVENS.\r\n                   II. A NIGHT ADDRESS TO THE DEITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     HUMBLY INSCRIBED TO HIS GRACE\r\n                         THE DUKE OF NEWCASTLE,\r\n          ONE OF HIS MAJESTY'S PRINCIPAL SECRETARIES OF STATE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Fatis contraria fata rependens.--Virg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              NIGHT NINTH.\r\n\r\n                            THE CONSOLATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n  As when a traveller, a long day past\r\n  In painful search of what he cannot find,\r\n  At night's approach, content with the next cot,\r\n  There ruminates, a while, his labour lost;\r\n  Then cheers his heart with what his fate affords,\r\n  And chants his sonnet to deceive the time,\r\n  Till the due season calls him to repose:\r\n  Thus I, long-travell'd in the ways of men,\r\n  And dancing, with the rest, the giddy maze,\r\n  Where Disappointment smiles at Hope's career;                       10\r\n  Warn'd by the languor of life's evening ray,\r\n  At length have housed me in an humble shed;\r\n  Where, future wandering banish'd from my thought,\r\n  And waiting, patient, the sweet hour of rest,\r\n  I chase the moments with a serious song.\r\n  Song soothes our pains; and age has pains to soothe.\r\n    When age, care, crime, and friends embraced at heart,\r\n  Torn from my bleeding breast, and death's dark shade,\r\n  Which hovers o'er me, quench th' ethereal fire;\r\n  Canst thou, O Night! indulge one labour more?                       20\r\n  One labour more indulge! then sleep, my strain!                     21\r\n  Till, haply, waked by Raphael's golden lyre,\r\n  Where night, death, age, care, crime, and sorrow, cease;\r\n  To bear a part in everlasting lays;\r\n  Though far, far higher set, in aim, I trust,\r\n  Symphonious to this humble prelude here.\r\n    Has not the Muse asserted pleasures pure,\r\n  Like those above; exploding other joys?\r\n  Weigh what was urged, Lorenzo! fairly weigh;\r\n  And tell me, hast thou cause to triumph still?                      30\r\n  I think, thou wilt forbear a boast so bold.\r\n  But if, beneath the favour of mistake,\r\n  Thy smile's sincere; not more sincere can be\r\n  Lorenzo's smile, than my compassion for him.\r\n  The sick in body call for aid; the sick\r\n  In mind are covetous of more disease;\r\n  And when at worst, they dream themselves quite well.\r\n  To know ourselves diseased, is half our cure.\r\n  When Nature's blush by Custom is wiped off,\r\n  And Conscience, deaden'd by repeated strokes,                       40\r\n  Has into manners naturalized our crimes;\r\n  The curse of curses is, our curse to love;\r\n  To triumph in the blackness of our guilt\r\n  (As Indians glory in the deepest jet),\r\n  And throw aside our senses with our peace.\r\n    But grant no guilt, no shame, no least alloy;\r\n  Grant joy and glory quite unsullied shone;\r\n  Yet, still, it ill deserves Lorenzo's heart.\r\n  No joy, no glory, glitters in thy sight,\r\n  But, through the thin partition of an hour,                         50\r\n  I see its sables wove by destiny;\r\n  And that in sorrow buried; this, in shame;\r\n  While howling furies wring the doleful knell;\r\n  And Conscience, now so soft thou scarce canst hear                  54\r\n  Her whisper, echoes her eternal peal.\r\n    Where, the prime actors of the last year's scene;\r\n  Their port so proud, their buskin, and their plume?\r\n  How many sleep, who kept the world awake\r\n  With lustre, and with noise! has Death proclaim'd\r\n  A truce, and hung his sated lance on high?\r\n  'Tis brandish'd still; nor shall the present year\r\n  Be more tenacious of her human leaf,                                62\r\n  Or spread of feeble life a thinner fall.\r\n    But needless monuments to wake the thought;\r\n  Life's gayest scenes speak man's mortality;\r\n  Though in a style more florid, full as plain,\r\n  As mausoleums, pyramids, and tombs.\r\n  What are our noblest ornaments, but deaths\r\n  Turn'd flatterers of life, in paint, or marble,\r\n  The well-stain'd canvas, or the featured stone?                     70\r\n  Our fathers grace, or rather haunt, the scene.\r\n  Joy peoples her pavilion from the dead.\r\n    \"Profess'd diversions! cannot these escape?\"\r\n  Far from it: these present us with a shroud;\r\n  And talk of death, like garlands o'er a grave.\r\n  As some bold plunderers, for buried wealth,\r\n  We ransack tombs for pastime; from the dust\r\n  Call up the sleeping hero; bid him tread\r\n  The scene for our amusement: how like gods\r\n  We sit; and, wrapt in immortality,                                  80\r\n  Shed generous tears on wretches born to die;\r\n  Their fate deploring, to forget our own!\r\n    What all the pomps and triumphs of our lives,\r\n  But legacies in blossom? Our lean soil,\r\n  Luxuriant grown, and rank in vanities,\r\n  From friends interr'd beneath; a rich manure!\r\n  Like other worms, we banquet on the dead;\r\n  Like other worms, shall we crawl on, nor know                       88\r\n  Our present frailties, or approaching fate?\r\n    Lorenzo! such the glories of the world!\r\n  What is the world itself? thy world--a grave.\r\n  Where is the dust that has not been alive?\r\n  The spade, the plough, disturb our ancestors;\r\n  From human mould we reap our daily bread.\r\n  The globe around earth's hollow surface shakes,\r\n  And is the ceiling of her sleeping sons.\r\n  O'er devastation we blind revels keep;\r\n  Whole buried towns support the dancer's heel.\r\n  The moist of human frame the sun exhales;\r\n  Winds scatter through the mighty void the dry;                     100\r\n  Earth repossesses part of what she gave,\r\n  And the freed spirit mounts on wings of fire;\r\n  Each element partakes our scatter'd spoils;\r\n  As nature, wide, our ruins spread: man's death\r\n  Inhabits all things, but the thought of man.\r\n    Nor man alone; his breathing bust expires,\r\n  His tomb is mortal; empires die: where, now,\r\n  The Roman? Greek? They stalk, an empty name!\r\n  Yet few regard them in this useful light;\r\n  Though half our learning is their epitaph.                         110\r\n  When down thy vale, unlock'd by midnight thought,\r\n  That loves to wander in thy sunless realms,\r\n  O Death! I stretch my view: what visions rise!\r\n  What triumphs! toils imperial! arts divine!\r\n  In wither'd laurels glide before my sight!\r\n  What lengths of far-famed ages, billow'd high\r\n  With human agitation, roll along\r\n  In unsubstantial images of air!\r\n  The melancholy ghosts of dead renown,\r\n  Whispering faint echoes of the world's applause,                   120\r\n  With penitential aspect, as they pass,\r\n  All point at earth, and hiss at human pride,                       122\r\n  The wisdom of the wise, and prancings of the great.\r\n    But, O Lorenzo! far the rest above,\r\n  Of ghastly nature, and enormous size,\r\n  One form assaults my sight, and chills my blood,\r\n  And shakes my frame. Of one departed world[52]\r\n  I see the mighty shadow: oozy wreath\r\n  And dismal seaweed crown her; o'er her urn\r\n  Reclined, she weeps her desolated realms,                          130\r\n  And bloated sons; and, weeping, prophesies\r\n  Another's dissolution, soon, in flames.\r\n  But, like Cassandra, prophesies in vain;\r\n  In vain, to many; not, I trust, to thee.\r\n    For, know'st thou not, or art thou loath to know,\r\n  The great decree, the counsel of the skies?\r\n  Deluge and conflagration, dreadful powers!\r\n  Prime ministers of vengeance! chain'd in caves\r\n  Distinct, apart the giant furies roar;\r\n  Apart; or, such their horrid rage for ruin,                        140\r\n  In mutual conflict would they rise, and wage\r\n  Eternal war, till one was quite devour'd.\r\n  But not for this, ordain'd their boundless rage;\r\n  When Heaven's inferior instruments of wrath,\r\n  War, famine, pestilence, are found too weak\r\n  To scourge a world for her enormous crimes,\r\n  These are let loose, alternate: down they rush,\r\n  Swift and tempestuous, from th' eternal throne,\r\n  With irresistible commission arm'd,\r\n  The world, in vain corrected, to destroy,                          150\r\n  And ease creation of the shocking scene.\r\n    Seest thou, Lorenzo! what depends on man?\r\n  The fate of Nature; as for man, her birth.\r\n  Earth's actors change earth's transitory scenes,\r\n  And make creation groan with human guilt.                          155\r\n  How must it groan, in a new deluge whelm'd,\r\n  But not of waters! At the destined hour,\r\n  By the loud trumpet summon'd to the charge,\r\n  See, all the formidable sons of fire,\r\n  Eruptions, earthquakes, comets, lightnings, play\r\n  Their various engines; all at once disgorge\r\n  Their blazing magazines; and take, by storm,                       162\r\n  This poor terrestrial citadel of man.\r\n    Amazing period! when each mountain-height\r\n  Outburns Vesuvius; rocks eternal pour\r\n  Their melted mass, as rivers once they pour'd;\r\n  Stars rush; and final Ruin fiercely drives\r\n  Her ploughshare o'er creation!--while aloft,\r\n  More than astonishment! if more can be!\r\n  Far other firmament than e'er was seen,                            170\r\n  Than e'er was thought by man! far other stars!\r\n  Stars animate, that govern these of fire;\r\n  Far other sun!--A sun, O how unlike\r\n  The Babe at Bethlehem! how unlike the Man,\r\n  That groan'd on Calvary!--Yet He it is;\r\n  That Man of Sorrows! O how changed! what pomp!\r\n  In grandeur terrible, all heaven descends!\r\n  And gods, ambitious, triumph in his train.\r\n  A swift archangel, with his golden wing,\r\n  As blots and clouds, that darken and disgrace                      180\r\n  The scene divine, sweeps stars and suns aside.\r\n  And now, all dross removed, heaven's own pure day,\r\n  Full on the confines of our ether, flames:\r\n  While (dreadful contrast!) far, how far beneath!\r\n  Hell, bursting, belches forth her blazing seas,\r\n  And storms sulphureous; her voracious jaws\r\n  Expanding wide, and roaring for her prey.\r\n    Lorenzo! welcome to this scene; the last\r\n  In nature's course; the first in wisdom's thought.                 189\r\n  This strikes, if aught can strike thee; this awakes\r\n  The most supine; this snatches man from death.\r\n  Rouse, rouse, Lorenzo, then, and follow me,\r\n  Where truth, the most momentous man can hear,\r\n  Loud calls my soul, and ardour wings her flight.\r\n  I find my inspiration in my theme:\r\n  The grandeur of my subject is my Muse.\r\n    At midnight, when mankind is wrapt in peace,\r\n  And worldly fancy feeds on golden dreams;\r\n  To give more dread to man's most dreadful hour.\r\n  At midnight, 'tis presumed, this pomp will burst                   200\r\n  From tenfold darkness; sudden as the spark\r\n  From smitten steel; from nitrous grain, the blaze.\r\n  Man, starting from his couch, shall sleep no more!\r\n  The day is broke, which never more shall close!\r\n  Above, around, beneath, amazement all!\r\n  Terror and glory join'd in their extremes!\r\n  Our God in grandeur, and our world on fire!\r\n  All nature struggling in the pangs of death!\r\n  Dost thou not hear her? Dost thou not deplore\r\n  Her strong convulsions, and her final groan?                       210\r\n  Where are we now? Ah me! the ground is gone,\r\n  On which we stood; Lorenzo! while thou may'st,\r\n  Provide more firm support, or sink for ever!\r\n  Where? how? from whence? Vain hope! it is too late!\r\n  Where, where, for shelter, shall the guilty fly,\r\n  When consternation turns the good man pale?\r\n    Great day! for which all other days were made;\r\n  For which earth rose from chaos, man from earth;\r\n  And an eternity, the date of gods,\r\n  Descended on poor earth-created man!                               220\r\n  Great day of dread, decision, and despair!\r\n  At thought of thee, each sublunary wish\r\n  Lets go its eager grasp, and drops the world;                      223\r\n  And catches at each reed of hope in heaven.\r\n  At thought of thee!--And art thou absent then?\r\n  Lorenzo! no; 'tis here; it is begun;--\r\n  Already is begun the grand assize,\r\n  In thee, in all: deputed Conscience scales\r\n  The dread tribunal, and forestalls our doom;\r\n  Forestalls; and, by forestalling, proves it sure.                  230\r\n  Why on himself should man void judgment pass?\r\n  Is idle Nature laughing at her sons?\r\n  Who Conscience sent, her sentence will support,\r\n  And God above assert that God in man.\r\n    Thrice happy they that enter now the court\r\n  Heaven opens in their bosoms! but, how rare,\r\n  Ah me! that magnanimity, how rare!\r\n  What hero, like the man who stands himself;\r\n  Who dares to meet his naked heart alone;\r\n  Who bears, intrepid, the full charge it brings,                    240\r\n  Resolved to silence future murmurs there?\r\n  The coward flies; and, flying, is undone.\r\n  (Art thou a coward? No.) The coward flies;\r\n  Thinks, but thinks slightly; asks, but fears to know;\r\n  Asks, \"What is truth?\" with Pilate; and retires;\r\n  Dissolves the court, and mingles with the throng;\r\n  Asylum sad! from reason, hope, and heaven!\r\n    Shall all, but man look out with ardent eye,\r\n  For that great day, which was ordain'd for man?\r\n  O day of consummation! mark supreme                                250\r\n  (If men are wise) of human thought! nor least,\r\n  Or in the sight of angels, or their King!\r\n  Angels, whose radiant circles, height o'er height,\r\n  Order o'er order, rising, blaze o'er blaze,\r\n  As in a theatre, surround this scene,\r\n  Intent on man, and anxious for his fate.\r\n  Angels look out for thee; for thee, their Lord,                    257\r\n  To vindicate his glory; and for thee,\r\n  Creation universal calls aloud,\r\n  To disinvolve the moral world, and give\r\n  To Nature's renovation brighter charms.\r\n    Shall man alone, whose fate, whose final fate\r\n  Hangs on that hour, exclude it from his thought?\r\n  I think of nothing else; I see! I feel it!\r\n  All nature, like an earthquake, trembling round!\r\n  All deities, like summer's swarms, on wing!\r\n  All basking in the full meridian blaze!\r\n  I see the Judge enthroned! the flaming guard!\r\n  The volume open'd! open'd every heart!\r\n  A sunbeam pointing out each secret thought!                        270\r\n  No patron! intercessor none! now past\r\n  The sweet, the clement, mediatorial hour!\r\n  For guilt no plea! to pain, no pause! no bound!\r\n  Inexorable, all! and all, extreme!\r\n    Nor man alone; the Foe of God and man,\r\n  From his dark den, blaspheming, drags his chain,\r\n  And rears his brazen front, with thunder scarr'd:\r\n  Receives his sentence, and begins his hell.\r\n  All vengeance past, now, seems abundant grace:\r\n  Like meteors in a stormy sky, how roll                             280\r\n  His baleful eyes! he curses whom he dreads;\r\n  And deems it the first moment of his fall.\r\n  'Tis present to my thought!--and yet where is it?\r\n  Angels can't tell me; angels cannot guess\r\n  The period; from created beings lock'd\r\n  In darkness. But the process, and the place,\r\n  Are less obscure; for these may man inquire.\r\n  Say, thou great close of human hopes and fears!\r\n  Great key of hearts! great finisher of fates!\r\n  Great end! and great beginning! say, Where art thou?\r\n  Art thou in time, or in eternity?                                  291\r\n  Nor in eternity, nor time, I find thee.\r\n  These, as two monarchs, on their borders meet,\r\n  (Monarchs of all elapsed, or unarrived!)\r\n  As in debate, how best their powers allied,\r\n  May swell the grandeur, or discharge the wrath,\r\n  Of Him, whom both their monarchies obey.\r\n    Time, this vast fabric for him built (and doom'd\r\n  With him to fall), now bursting o'er his head;\r\n  His lamp, the sun, extinguish'd; from beneath                      300\r\n  The frown of hideous darkness, calls his sons\r\n  From their long slumber; from earth's heaving womb,\r\n  To second birth! contemporary throng!\r\n  Roused at one call, upstarted from one bed,\r\n  Press'd in one crowd, appall'd with one amaze,\r\n  He turns them o'er, Eternity! to thee.\r\n  Then (as a king deposed disdains to live)\r\n  He falls on his own scythe; nor falls alone:\r\n  His greatest foe falls with him; Time, and he\r\n  Who murder'd all Time's offspring, Death, expire.                  310\r\n    Time was! Eternity now reigns alone:\r\n  Awful eternity! offended queen!\r\n  And her resentment to mankind, how just!\r\n  With kind intent, soliciting access,\r\n  How often has she knock'd at human hearts!\r\n  Rich to repay their hospitality;\r\n  How often call'd! and with the voice of God!\r\n  Yet bore repulse, excluded as a cheat!\r\n  A dream! while foulest foes found welcome there!\r\n  A dream, a cheat, now, all things, but her smile.                  320\r\n    For, lo! her twice ten thousand gates thrown wide,\r\n  As thrice from Indus to the frozen pole,\r\n  With banners streaming as the comet's blaze,\r\n  And clarions, louder than the deep in storms,\r\n  Sonorous as immortal breath can blow,                              325\r\n  Pour forth their myriads, potentates, and powers,\r\n  Of light, of darkness; in a middle field,\r\n  Wide, as creation! populous, as wide!\r\n  A neutral region! there to mark th' event\r\n  Of that great drama, whose preceding scenes\r\n  Detain'd them close spectators, through a length\r\n  Of ages, ripening to this grand result;                            332\r\n  Ages, as yet unnumber'd, but by God;\r\n  Who now, pronouncing sentence, vindicates\r\n  The rights of Virtue, and his own renown.\r\n    Eternity, the various sentence past,\r\n  Assigns the sever'd throng distinct abodes,\r\n  Sulphureous, or ambrosial. What ensues?\r\n  The deed predominant! the deed of deeds!\r\n  Which makes a hell of hell, a heaven of heaven.                    340\r\n  The goddess, with determined aspect, turns\r\n  Her adamantine key's enormous size\r\n  Through destiny's inextricable wards,\r\n  Deep driving every bolt, on both their fates.\r\n  Then, from the crystal battlements of heaven,\r\n  Down, down, she hurls it through the dark profound,\r\n  Ten thousand thousand fathom; there to rust,\r\n  And ne'er unlock her resolution more.\r\n  The deep resounds; and hell, through all her glooms,\r\n  Returns, in groans, the melancholy roar.                           350\r\n    O how unlike the chorus of the skies!\r\n  O how unlike those shouts of joy, that shake\r\n  The whole ethereal! how the concave rings!\r\n  Nor strange! when deities their voice exalt;\r\n  And louder far, than when creation rose,\r\n  To see creation's godlike aim, and end,\r\n  So well accomplish'd! so divinely closed!\r\n  To see the mighty dramatist's last act,\r\n  (As meet), in glory rising o'er the rest.                          359\r\n  No fancied god, a God indeed, descends,\r\n  To solve all knots; to strike the moral home;\r\n  To throw full day on darkest scenes of time;\r\n  To clear, commend, exalt, and crown the whole.\r\n  Hence, in one peal of loud, eternal praise,\r\n  The charm'd spectators thunder their applause;\r\n  And the vast void beyond, applause resounds.\r\n    What then am I?--\r\n                    Amidst applauding worlds,\r\n  And worlds celestial, is there found on earth,\r\n  A peevish, dissonant, rebellious string,                           370\r\n  Which jars in the grand chorus, and complains?\r\n  Censure on thee, Lorenzo! I suspend,\r\n  And turn it on myself; how greatly due!\r\n  All, all is right; by God ordain'd or done;\r\n  And who, but God, resumed the friends He gave?\r\n  And have I been complaining, then, so long?\r\n  Complaining of his favours; pain, and death?\r\n  Who, without Pain's advice, would e'er be good?\r\n  Who, without Death, but would be good in vain?\r\n  Pain is to save from pain; all punishment,                         380\r\n  To make for peace; and death, to save from Death;\r\n  And second death, to guard immortal life;\r\n  To rouse the careless, the presumptuous awe,\r\n  And turn the tide of souls another way;\r\n  By the same tenderness divine ordain'd,\r\n  That planted Eden, and high bloom'd for man,\r\n  A fairer Eden, endless, in the skies.\r\n    Heaven gives us friends to bless the present scene;\r\n  Resumes them, to prepare us for the next.\r\n  All evils natural are moral goods;                                 390\r\n  All discipline, indulgence, on the whole.\r\n  None are unhappy: all have cause to smile,\r\n  But such as to themselves that cause deny.                         393\r\n  Our faults are at the bottom of our pains;\r\n  Error, in act, or judgment, is the source\r\n  Of endless sighs: we sin, or we mistake;\r\n  And Nature tax, when false opinion stings.\r\n  Let impious grief be banish'd, joy indulged;\r\n  But chiefly then, when Grief puts in her claim.\r\n  Joy from the joyous, frequently betrays,                           400\r\n  Oft lives in vanity, and dies in woe.\r\n  Joy, amidst ills, corroborates, exalts;\r\n  'Tis joy and conquest; joy, and virtue too.\r\n  A noble fortitude in ills, delights\r\n  Heaven, earth, ourselves; 'tis duty, glory, peace.\r\n  Affliction is the good man's shining scene;\r\n  Prosperity conceals his brightest ray;\r\n  As night to stars, woe lustre gives to man.\r\n  Heroes in battle, pilots in the storm,\r\n  And virtue in calamities, admire.                                  410\r\n  The crown of manhood is a winter-joy;\r\n  An evergreen, that stands the northern blast,\r\n  And blossoms in the rigour of our fate.\r\n    'Tis a prime part of happiness, to know\r\n  How much unhappiness must prove our lot;\r\n  A part which few possess! I'll pay life's tax,\r\n  Without one rebel murmur, from this hour,\r\n  Nor think it misery to be a man;\r\n  Who thinks it is, shall never be a god.\r\n  Some ills we wish for, when we wish to live.                       420\r\n    What spoke proud Passion?--\"Wish my being lost?\"[53]\r\n  Presumptuous! blasphemous! absurd! and false!\r\n  The triumph of my soul is,--that I am;\r\n  And therefore that I may be--what? Lorenzo!\r\n  Look inward, and look deep; and deeper still;\r\n  Unfathomably deep our treasure runs                                426\r\n  In golden veins, through all eternity!\r\n  Ages, and ages, and succeeding still\r\n  New ages, where the phantom of an hour,\r\n  Which courts each night, dull slumber, for repair,\r\n  Shall wake, and wonder, and exult, and praise,\r\n  And fly through infinite, and all unlock;\r\n  And (if deserved) by Heaven's redundant love,                      433\r\n  Made half adorable itself, adore;\r\n  And find, in adoration, endless joy!\r\n  Where thou, not master of a moment here,\r\n  Frail as the flower, and fleeting as the gale,\r\n  May'st boast a whole eternity, enrich'd\r\n  With all a kind Omnipotence can pour.\r\n  Since Adam fell, no mortal, uninspired,                            440\r\n  Has ever yet conceived, or ever shall,\r\n  How kind is God, how great (if good) is Man.\r\n  No man too largely from Heaven's love can hope,\r\n  If what is hoped he labours to secure.\r\n    Ills?--there are none: All-gracious! none from thee;\r\n  From man full many! numerous is the race\r\n  Of blackest ills, and those immortal too,\r\n  Begot by Madness, on fair Liberty;\r\n  Heaven's daughter, hell-debauch'd! her hand alone\r\n  Unlocks destruction to the sons of men,                            450\r\n  First barr'd by thine: high-wall'd with adamant,\r\n  Guarded with terrors reaching to this world,\r\n  And cover'd with the thunders of thy law;\r\n  Whose threats are mercies, whose injunctions, guides,\r\n  Assisting, not restraining, Reason's choice;\r\n  Whose sanctions, unavoidable results\r\n  From nature's course, indulgently reveal'd;\r\n  If unreveal'd, more dangerous, nor less sure.\r\n  Thus, an indulgent father warns his sons,\r\n  \"Do this; fly that\"--nor always tells the cause;                   460\r\n  Pleased to reward, as duty to his will,\r\n  A conduct needful to their own repose.\r\n    Great God of wonders! (if, thy love survey'd,\r\n  Aught else the name of wonderful retains),\r\n  What rocks are these, on which to build our trust!\r\n  Thy ways admit no blemish; none I find;\r\n  Or this alone--\"That none is to be found.\"\r\n  Not one, to soften Censure's hardy crime;\r\n  Not one, to palliate peevish Grief's Complaint,\r\n  Who, like a demon, murmuring from the dust,                        470\r\n  Dares into judgment call her Judge.--Supreme!\r\n  For all I bless thee; most, for the severe;\r\n  Her[54] death--my own at hand--the fiery gulf,\r\n  That flaming bound of wrath omnipotent!\r\n  It thunders;--but it thunders to preserve;\r\n  It strengthens what it strikes; its wholesome dread\r\n  Averts the dreaded pain; its hideous groans\r\n  Join heaven's sweet hallelujahs in thy praise,\r\n  Great Source of good alone! how kind in all!\r\n  In vengeance kind! Pain, Death, Gehenna, save.                     480\r\n    Thus, in thy world material, Mighty Mind!\r\n  Not that alone which solaces, and shines,\r\n  The rough and gloomy, challenges our praise.\r\n  The winter is as needful as the spring;\r\n  The thunder, as the sun; a stagnate mass\r\n  Of vapours breeds a pestilential air:\r\n  Nor more propitious the Favonian[55] breeze\r\n  To nature's health, than purifying storms;\r\n  The dread volcano ministers to good.\r\n  Its smother'd flames might undermine the world.                    490\r\n  Loud Etnas fulminate in love to man;\r\n  Comets good omens are, when duly scann'd;                          492\r\n  And, in their use, eclipses learn to shine.\r\n    Man is responsible for ills received;\r\n  Those we call wretched are a chosen band,\r\n  Compell'd to refuge in the right, for peace.\r\n  Amid my list of blessings infinite,\r\n  Stands this the foremost, \"That my heart has bled.\"\r\n  'Tis Heaven's last effort of good-will to man;\r\n  When Pain can't bless, Heaven quits us in despair.                 500\r\n  Who fails to grieve, when just occasion calls,\r\n  Or grieves too much, deserves not to be blest;\r\n  Inhuman, or effeminate, his heart;\r\n  Reason absolves the grief, which reason ends.\r\n  May Heaven ne'er trust my friend with happiness,\r\n  Till it has taught him how to bear it well,\r\n  By previous pain; and made it safe to smile!\r\n  Such smiles are mine, and such may they remain;\r\n  Nor hazard their extinction, from excess.\r\n  My change of heart a change of style demands;                      510\r\n  The Consolation cancels the Complaint,\r\n  And makes a convert of my guilty song.\r\n    As when o'er-labour'd, and inclined to breathe,\r\n  A panting traveller, some rising ground,\r\n  Some small ascent, has gain'd, he turns him round,\r\n  And measures with his eye the various vales,\r\n  The fields, woods, meads, and rivers, he has pass'd;\r\n  And, satiate of his journey, thinks of home,\r\n  Endear'd by distance, nor affects more toil;\r\n  Thus I, though small, indeed, is that ascent                       520\r\n  The Muse has gain'd, review the paths she trod;\r\n  Various, extensive, beaten but by view;\r\n  And, conscious of her prudence in repose,\r\n  Pause; and with pleasure meditate an end,\r\n  Though still remote; so fruitful is my theme.\r\n  Through many a field of moral, and divine,                         526\r\n  The Muse has stray'd; and much of sorrow seen\r\n  In human ways; and much of false and vain;\r\n  Which none, who travel this bad road, can miss.\r\n  O'er friends deceased full heartily she wept;\r\n  Of love divine the wonders she display'd;\r\n  Proved man immortal; show'd the source of joy\r\n  The grand tribunal raised; assign'd the bounds\r\n  Of human grief: in few, to close the whole,\r\n  The moral Muse has shadow'd out a sketch,\r\n  Though not in form, nor with a Raphael-stroke,\r\n  Of most our weakness needs believe, or do,\r\n  In this our land of travel, and of hope,\r\n  For peace on earth, or prospect of the skies.                      539\r\n    What then remains? much! much! a mighty debt\r\n  To be discharged: these thoughts, O Night! are thine;\r\n  From thee they came, like lovers' secret sighs,\r\n  While others slept. So, Cynthia (poets feign),\r\n  In shadows veil'd, soft-sliding from her sphere,\r\n  Her shepherd cheer'd; of her enamour'd less,\r\n  Than I of thee.--And art thou still unsung,\r\n  Beneath whose brow, and by whose aid, I sing?\r\n  Immortal silence! where shall I begin?\r\n  Where end? or how steal music from the spheres,\r\n  To soothe their goddess?                                           550\r\n                      O majestic Night!\r\n  Nature's great ancestor! Day's elder-born!\r\n  And fated to survive the transient sun!\r\n  By mortals, and immortals, seen with awe!\r\n  A starry crown thy raven brow adorns,\r\n  An azure zone thy waist; clouds, in heaven's loom\r\n  Wrought through varieties of shape and shade,\r\n  In ample folds of drapery divine,\r\n  Thy flowing mantle form; and, heaven throughout,\r\n  Voluminously pour thy pompous train.                               560\r\n  Thy gloomy grandeurs (nature's most august,\r\n  Inspiring aspect!) claim a grateful verse;\r\n  And, like a sable curtain starr'd with gold,\r\n  Drawn o'er my labours past, shall close the scene.\r\n    And what, O man! so worthy to be sung?\r\n  What more prepares us for the songs of heaven?\r\n  Creation, of archangels is the theme!\r\n  What, to be sung, so needful? What so well\r\n  Celestial joys prepare us to sustain?\r\n  The soul of man, His face design'd to see,                         570\r\n  Who gave these wonders to be seen by man,\r\n  Has here a previous scene of objects great,\r\n  On which to dwell; to stretch to that expanse\r\n  Of thought, to rise to that exalted height\r\n  Of admiration, to contract that awe,\r\n  And give her whole capacities that strength,\r\n  Which best may qualify for final joy.\r\n  The more our spirits are enlarged on earth,\r\n  The deeper draught shall they receive of heaven.\r\n    Heaven's King! whose face unveil'd consummates bliss;\r\n  Redundant bliss! which fills that mighty void,                     581\r\n  The whole creation leaves in human hearts!\r\n  Thou, who didst touch the lip of Jesse's son,\r\n  Rapt in sweet contemplation of these fires,\r\n  And set his harp in concert with the spheres;\r\n  While of thy works material the supreme\r\n  I dare attempt, assist my daring song.\r\n  Loose me from earth's enclosure, from the sun's\r\n  Contracted circle set my heart at large;\r\n  Eliminate my spirit, give it range                                 590\r\n  Through provinces of thought yet unexplored;\r\n  Teach me, by this stupendous scaffolding,\r\n  Creation's golden steps, to climb to Thee.\r\n  Teach me with Art great Nature to control,                         594\r\n  And spread a lustre o'er the shades of Night.\r\n  Feel I thy kind assent? and shall the sun\r\n  Be seen at midnight, rising in my song?\r\n    Lorenzo! come, and warm thee: thou, whose heart,\r\n  Whose little heart, is moor'd within a nook\r\n  Of this obscure terrestrial, anchor weigh.\r\n  Another ocean calls, a nobler port;\r\n  I am thy pilot, I thy prosperous gale.                             602\r\n  Gainful thy voyage through yon azure main;\r\n  Main, without tempest, pirate, rock, or shore;\r\n  And whence thou may'st import eternal wealth;\r\n  And leave to beggar'd minds the pearl and gold.\r\n  Thy travels dost thou boast o'er foreign realms?\r\n  Thou stranger to the world! thy tour begin;\r\n  Thy tour through Nature's universal orb.\r\n  Nature delineates her whole chart at large,                        610\r\n  On soaring souls, that sail among the spheres;\r\n  And man how purblind, if unknown the whole!\r\n  Who circles spacious earth, then travels here,\r\n  Shall own, he never was from home before!\r\n  Come, my Prometheus,[56] from thy pointed rock\r\n  Of false ambition; if unchain'd, we'll mount;\r\n  We'll, innocently, steal celestial fire,\r\n  And kindle our devotion at the stars;\r\n  A theft, that shall not chain, but set thee free.\r\n    Above our atmosphere's intestine[57] wars,                       620\r\n  Rain's fountain-head, the magazine of hail;\r\n  Above the northern nests of feather'd snows,\r\n  The brew of thunders, and the flaming forge\r\n  That forms the crooked lightning; 'bove the caves\r\n  Where infant tempests wait their growing wings,\r\n  And tune their tender voices to that roar,\r\n  Which soon, perhaps, shall shake a guilty world;                   627\r\n  Above misconstrued omens of the sky,\r\n  Far-travell'd comets' calculated blaze;\r\n  Elance[58] thy thought, and think of more than man.\r\n  Thy soul, till now, contracted, wither'd, shrunk,\r\n  Blighted by blasts of earth's unwholesome air,\r\n  Will blossom here; spread all her faculties\r\n  To these bright ardours; every power unfold,\r\n  And rise into sublimities of thought.\r\n  Stars teach, as well as shine. At Nature's birth,\r\n  Thus their commission ran--\"Be kind to Man.\"\r\n  Where art thou, poor benighted traveller?\r\n  The stars will light thee, though the moon should fail.\r\n  Where art thou, more benighted! more astray!                       640\r\n  In ways immoral? The stars call thee back;\r\n  And, if obey'd their counsel, set thee right.\r\n    This prospect vast, what is it?--Weigh'd aright,\r\n  'Tis Nature's system of divinity,\r\n  And every student of the Night inspires.\r\n  'Tis elder Scripture, writ by God's own hand:\r\n  Scripture authentic! uncorrupt by man.\r\n  Lorenzo! with my radius (the rich gift\r\n  Of thought nocturnal!) I'll point out to thee\r\n  Its various lessons; some that may surprise                        650\r\n  An un-adept in mysteries of Night;\r\n  Little, perhaps, expected in her school,\r\n  Nor thought to grow on planet, or on star.\r\n  Bulls, lions, scorpions, monsters here we feign;\r\n  Ourselves more monstrous, not to see what here\r\n  Exists indeed;--a lecture to mankind.\r\n    What read we here?--Th' existence of a God?\r\n  Yes; and of other beings, man above;\r\n  Natives of ether! sons of higher climes!\r\n  And, what may move Lorenzo's wonder more,                          660\r\n  Eternity is written in the skies.                                  661\r\n  And whose eternity?--Lorenzo! thine\r\n  Mankind's eternity. Nor Faith alone,\r\n  Virtue grows here; here springs the sovereign cure\r\n  Of almost every vice; but chiefly thine;\r\n  Wrath, Pride, Ambition, and impure Desire.\r\n    Lorenzo! thou canst wake at midnight too,\r\n  Though not on morals bent: Ambition, Pleasure!\r\n  Those tyrants I for thee so lately fought,[59]\r\n  Afford their harass'd slaves but slender rest.                     670\r\n  Thou, to whom midnight is immoral noon,\r\n  And the sun's noontide blaze, prime dawn of day;\r\n  Not by thy climate, but capricious crime,\r\n  Commencing one of our antipodes!\r\n  In thy nocturnal rove, one moment halt,\r\n  'Twixt stage and stage, of riot, and cabal;\r\n  And lift thine eye (if bold an eye to lift,\r\n  If bold to meet the face of injured Heaven)\r\n  To yonder stars: for other ends they shine,\r\n  Than to light revellers from shame to shame,                       680\r\n  And, thus, be made accomplices in guilt.\r\n    Why from yon arch, that infinite of space,\r\n  With infinite of lucid orbs replete,\r\n  Which set the living firmament on fire,\r\n  At the first glance, in such an overwhelm\r\n  Of wonderful, on man's astonish'd sight,\r\n  Rushes Omnipotence--To curb our pride;\r\n  Our reason rouse, and lead it to that Power,\r\n  Whose love lets down these silver chains of light;\r\n  To draw up man's ambition to Himself,                              690\r\n  And bind our chaste affections to His throne.\r\n  Thus the three virtues, least alive on earth,\r\n  And welcomed on heaven's coast with most applause,\r\n  An humble, pure, and heavenly-minded heart,                        694\r\n  Are here inspired:--and canst thou gaze too long?\r\n    Nor stands thy wrath deprived of its reproof,\r\n  Or un-upbraided by this radiant choir.\r\n  The planets of each system represent\r\n  Kind neighbours; mutual amity prevails;\r\n  Sweet interchange of rays, received, return'd;\r\n  Enlightening, and enlighten'd! all, at once,\r\n  Attracting, and attracted! Patriot like,                           702\r\n  None sins against the welfare of the whole;\r\n  But their reciprocal, unselfish aid,\r\n  Affords an emblem of millennial love.\r\n  Nothing in nature, much less conscious being,\r\n  Was e'er created solely for itself:\r\n  Thus man his sovereign duty learns in this\r\n  Material picture of benevolence.\r\n    And know, of all our supercilious race,                          710\r\n  Thou most inflammable! thou wasp of men!\r\n  Man's angry heart, inspected, would be found\r\n  As rightly set, as are the starry spheres;\r\n  'Tis Nature's structure, broke by stubborn will,\r\n  Breeds all that uncelestial discord there.\r\n  Wilt thou not feel the bias Nature gave?\r\n  Canst thou descend from converse with the skies,\r\n  And seize thy brother's throat?--For what--a clod,\r\n  An inch of earth? The planets cry, \"Forbear!\"\r\n  They chase our double darkness; Nature's gloom,                    720\r\n  And (kinder still!) our intellectual night.\r\n    And see, Day's amiable sister sends\r\n  Her invitation, in the softest rays\r\n  Of mitigated lustre; courts thy sight,\r\n  Which suffers from her tyrant brother's blaze.\r\n  Night grants thee the full freedom of the skies,\r\n  Nor rudely reprimands thy lifted eye;\r\n  With gain, and joy, she bribes thee to be wise.                    728\r\n  Night opes the noblest scenes, and sheds an awe,\r\n  Which gives those venerable scenes full weight,\r\n  And deep reception, in th' intender'd heart;\r\n  While light peeps through the darkness, like a spy;\r\n  And darkness shows its grandeur by the light.\r\n  Nor is the profit greater than the joy,\r\n  If human hearts at glorious objects glow,\r\n  And admiration can inspire delight.\r\n    What speak I more, than I, this moment, feel?\r\n  With pleasing stupor first the soul is struck\r\n  (Stupor ordain'd to make her truly wise!):\r\n  Then into transport starting from her trance,                      740\r\n  With love, and admiration, how she glows!\r\n  This gorgeous apparatus! this display!\r\n  This ostentation of creative power!\r\n  This theatre!--what eye can take it in?\r\n  By what divine enchantment was it raised,\r\n  For minds of the first magnitude to launch\r\n  In endless speculation, and adore?\r\n  One sun by day, by night ten thousand shine;\r\n  And light us deep into the Deity;\r\n  How boundless in magnificence and might!                           750\r\n  O what a confluence of ethereal fires,\r\n  Form urns unnumber'd, down the steep of heaven,\r\n  Streams to a point, and centres in my sight!\r\n  Nor tarries there; I feel it at my heart.\r\n  My heart, at once, it humbles, and exalts;\r\n  Lays it in dust, and calls it to the skies.\r\n  Who sees it unexalted? or unawed?\r\n  Who sees it, and can stop at what is seen?\r\n  Material offspring of Omnipotence!\r\n  Inanimate, all-animating birth!                                    760\r\n  Work worthy Him who made it! worthy praise!\r\n  All praise! praise more than human! nor denied                     762\r\n  Thy praise divine!--But though man, drown'd in sleep,\r\n  Withholds his homage, not alone I wake;\r\n  Bright legions swarm unseen, and sing, unheard\r\n  By mortal ear, the glorious Architect,\r\n  In this His universal temple hung\r\n  With lustres, with innumerable lights,\r\n  That shed religion on the soul; at once,\r\n  The temple, and the preacher! O how loud                           770\r\n  It calls devotion! genuine growth of Night!\r\n    Devotion! daughter of Astronomy!\r\n  An undevout astronomer is mad.\r\n  True; all things speak a God; but in the small,\r\n  Men trace out Him; in great, He seizes man;\r\n  Seizes, and elevates, and wraps, and fills\r\n  With new inquiries, 'mid associates new.\r\n  Tell me, ye stars! ye planets! tell me, all\r\n  Ye starr'd, and planeted, inhabitants! what is it?\r\n  What are these sons of wonder? say, proud arch                     780\r\n  (Within those azure palaces they dwell),\r\n  Built with divine ambition! in disdain\r\n  Of limit built! built in the taste of heaven!\r\n  Vast concave! ample dome! wast thou design'd\r\n  A meet apartment for the Deity?--\r\n  Not so; that thought alone thy state impairs,\r\n  Thy lofty sinks, and shallows thy profound,\r\n  And straitens thy diffusive; dwarfs the whole,\r\n  And makes a universe an orrery[60].\r\n    But when I drop mine eye, and look on man,                       790\r\n  Thy right regain'd, thy grandeur is restored,\r\n  O Nature! wide flies off th' expanding round.\r\n  As when whole magazines, at once, are fired,\r\n  The smitten air is hollow'd by the blow;\r\n  The vast displosion dissipates the clouds;\r\n  Shock'd ether's billows dash the distant skies;                    796\r\n  Thus (but far more) th' expanding round flies off,\r\n  And leaves a mighty void, a spacious womb,\r\n  Might teem with new creation; reinflamed\r\n  Thy luminaries triumph, and assume\r\n  Divinity themselves. Nor was it strange,\r\n  Matter high-wrought to such surprising pomp,\r\n  Such godlike glory, stole the style of gods,                       803\r\n  From ages dark, obtuse, and steep'd in sense;\r\n  For, sure, to sense, they truly are divine,\r\n  And half absolved idolatry from guilt;\r\n  Nay, turn'd it into virtue. Such it was\r\n  In those, who put forth all they had of man\r\n  Unlost, to lift their thought, nor mounted higher;\r\n  But, weak of wing, on planets perch'd; and thought                 810\r\n  What was their highest, must be their adored.\r\n    But they how weak, who could no higher mount?\r\n  And are there, then, Lorenzo! those, to whom\r\n  Unseen, and unexistent, are the same?\r\n  And if incomprehensible is join'd,\r\n  Who dare pronounce it madness, to believe?\r\n  Why has the mighty Builder thrown aside\r\n  All measure in His work; stretch'd out His line\r\n  So far, and spread amazement o'er the whole?\r\n  Then (as he took delight in wide extremes),                        820\r\n  Deep in the bosom of His universe,\r\n  Dropp'd down that reasoning mite, that insect, Man,\r\n  To crawl, and gaze, and wonder at the scene?--\r\n  That man might ne'er presume to plead amazement\r\n  For disbelief of wonders in himself.\r\n  Shall God be less miraculous, than what\r\n  His hand has form'd? Shall mysteries descend\r\n  From unmysterious? things more elevate,\r\n  Be more familiar? uncreated lie\r\n  More obvious than created, to the grasp                            830\r\n  Of human thought? The more of wonderful\r\n  Is heard in Him, the more we should assent.\r\n  Could we conceive Him, God He could not be;\r\n  Or He not God, or we could not be men.\r\n  A God alone can comprehend a God;\r\n  Man's distance how immense! On such a theme,\r\n  Know this, Lorenzo! (seem it ne'er so strange)\r\n  Nothing can satisfy, but what confounds;\r\n  Nothing, but what astonishes, is true.\r\n  The scene thou seest, attests the truth I sing,                    840\r\n  And every star sheds light upon thy creed.\r\n  These stars, this furniture, this cost of heaven,\r\n  If but reported, thou hadst ne'er believed;\r\n  But thine eye tells thee, the romance is true.\r\n  The grand of nature is th' Almighty's oath,\r\n  In Reason's court, to silence Unbelief.\r\n    How my mind, opening at this scene, imbibes\r\n  The moral emanations of the skies,\r\n  While nought, perhaps, Lorenzo less admires!\r\n  Has the Great Sovereign sent ten thousand worlds                   850\r\n  To tells us, He resides above them all,\r\n  In glory's unapproachable recess?\r\n  And dare earth's bold inhabitants deny\r\n  The sumptuous, the magnific embassy\r\n  A moment's audience? Turn we, nor will hear\r\n  From whom they come, or what they would impart\r\n  For man's emolument; sole cause that stoops\r\n  Their grandeur to man's eye? Lorenzo! rouse;\r\n  Let thought, awaken'd, take the lightning's wing,\r\n  And glance from east to west, from pole to pole.                   860\r\n  Who sees, but is confounded, or convinced?\r\n  Renounces reason, or a God adores?\r\n  Mankind was sent into the world to see:\r\n  Sight gives the science needful to their peace;                    864\r\n  That obvious science asks small learning's aid.\r\n  Would'st thou on metaphysic pinions soar?\r\n  Or wound thy patience amid logic thorns?\r\n  Or travel history's enormous round?\r\n  Nature no such hard task enjoins: she gave\r\n  A make to man directive of his thought;\r\n  A make set upright, pointing to the stars,\r\n  As who shall say, \"Read thy chief lesson there.\"                   872\r\n  Too late to read this manuscript of heaven,\r\n  When, like a parchment scroll, shrunk up by flames,\r\n  It folds Lorenzo's lesson from his sight.\r\n    Lesson how various! Not the God alone,\r\n  I see His ministers; I see, diffused\r\n  In radiant orders, essences sublime,\r\n  Of various offices, of various plume,\r\n  In heavenly liveries, distinctly clad,                             880\r\n  Azure, green, purple, pearl, or downy gold,\r\n  Or all commix'd; they stand, with wings outspread,\r\n  Listening to catch the Master's least command,\r\n  And fly through nature, ere the moment ends;\r\n  Numbers innumerable!--well conceived\r\n  By Pagan, and by Christian! O'er each sphere\r\n  Presides an angel, to direct its course,\r\n  And feed, or fan, its flames; or to discharge\r\n  Other high trusts unknown. For who can see\r\n  Such pomp of matter, and imagine, Mind,                            890\r\n  For which alone Inanimate was made,\r\n  More sparingly dispensed? that nobler son,\r\n  Far liker the great Sire!--'Tis thus the skies\r\n  Inform us of superiors numberless,\r\n  As much, in excellence, above mankind,\r\n  As above earth, in magnitude, the spheres.\r\n  These, as a cloud of witnesses, hang o'er us;\r\n  In a throng'd theatre are all our deeds;                           898\r\n  Perhaps, a thousand demigods descend\r\n  On every beam we see, to walk with men.\r\n  Awful reflection! Strong restraint from ill!\r\n    Yet, here, our virtue finds still stronger aid\r\n  From these ethereal glories sense surveys.\r\n  Something, like magic, strikes from this blue vault;\r\n  With just attention is it view'd? We feel\r\n  A sudden succour, unimplored, unthought;\r\n  Nature herself does half the work of Man.\r\n  Seas, rivers, mountains, forests, deserts, rocks,\r\n  The promontory's height, the depth profound\r\n  Of subterranean, excavated grots[61],                              910\r\n  Black brow'd, and vaulted high, and yawning wide\r\n  From Nature's structure, or the scoop of Time;\r\n  If ample of dimension, vast of size,\r\n  Even these an aggrandizing impulse give;\r\n  Of solemn thought enthusiastic heights\r\n  Even these infuse.--But what of vast in these?\r\n  Nothing;--or we must own the skies forgot.\r\n  Much less in art.--Vain art! Thou pigmy power!\r\n  How dost thou swell and strut, with human pride,\r\n  To show thy littleness! What childish toys,                        920\r\n  Thy watery columns squirted to the clouds!\r\n  Thy basin'd rivers, and imprison'd seas!\r\n  Thy mountains moulded into forms of men!\r\n  Thy hundred-gated capitals! or those\r\n  Where three days' travel left us much to ride;\r\n  Gazing on miracles by mortals wrought,\r\n  Arches triumphal, theatres immense,\r\n  Or nodding gardens pendent in mid-air!\r\n  Or temples proud to meet their gods half-way!\r\n  Yet these affect us in no common kind.                             930\r\n  What then the force of such superior scenes?\r\n  Enter a temple, it will strike an awe:                             932\r\n  What awe from this the Deity has built!\r\n  A good man seen, though silent, counsel gives:\r\n  The touch'd spectator wishes to be wise:\r\n  In a bright mirror His own hands have made,\r\n  Here we see something like the face of God.\r\n  Seems it not then enough, to say, Lorenzo!\r\n  To man abandon'd, \"Hast thou seen the skies?\"\r\n    And yet, so thwarted Nature's kind design                        940\r\n  By daring man, he makes her sacred awe\r\n  (That guard from ill) his shelter, his temptation\r\n  To more than common guilt, and quite inverts\r\n  Celestial art's intent. The trembling stars\r\n  See crimes gigantic, stalking through the gloom\r\n  With front erect, that hide their head by day,\r\n  And making night still darker by their deeds.\r\n  Slumbering in covert, till the shades descend,\r\n  Rapine and Murder, link'd, now prowl for prey.\r\n  The miser earths his treasure; and the thief,                      950\r\n  Watching the mole, half beggars him ere morn.\r\n  Now plots, and foul conspiracies, awake;\r\n  And, muffling up their horrors from the moon,\r\n  Havoc and devastation they prepare,\r\n  And kingdoms tottering in the field of blood.\r\n  Now sons of riot in mid-revel rage.\r\n  What shall I do?--suppress it? or proclaim?--\r\n  Why sleeps the thunder? Now, Lorenzo! now,\r\n  His best friend's couch the rank adulterer\r\n  Ascends secure; and laughs at gods and men.                        960\r\n  Preposterous madmen, void of fear or shame,\r\n  Lay their crimes bare to these chaste eyes of Heaven;\r\n  Yet shrink, and shudder, at a mortal's sight.\r\n  Were moon, and stars, for villains only made?\r\n  To guide, yet screen them, with tenebrious[62] light?\r\n  No; they were made to fashion the sublime                          966\r\n  Of human hearts, and wiser make the wise.\r\n    Those ends were answer'd once; when mortals lived\r\n  Of stronger wing, of aquiline ascent\r\n  In theory sublime. O how unlike\r\n  Those vermin of the night, this moment sung,\r\n  Who crawl on earth, and on her venom feed!                         972\r\n  Those ancient sages, human stars! They met\r\n  Their brothers of the skies, at midnight hour;\r\n  Their counsel ask'd; and, what they ask'd, obey'd.\r\n  The Stagirite, and Plato, he who drank[63]\r\n  The poison'd bowl, and he of Tusculum,[64]\r\n  With him of Corduba,[65] (immortal names!)\r\n  In these unbounded, and Elysian, walks,\r\n  An area fit for gods, and godlike men,                             980\r\n  They took their nightly round, through radiant paths\r\n  By seraphs trod; instructed, chiefly, thus,\r\n  To tread in their bright footsteps here below;\r\n  To walk in worth still brighter than the skies.\r\n  There they contracted their contempt of earth;\r\n  Of hopes eternal kindled, there, the fire;\r\n  There, as in near approach, they glow'd, and grew\r\n  (Great visitants!) more intimate with God,\r\n  More worth to men, more joyous to themselves.\r\n  Through various virtues, they, with ardour, ran                    990\r\n  The zodiac of their learn'd, illustrious lives.\r\n    In Christian hearts, O for a Pagan zeal!\r\n  A needful, but opprobrious prayer! As much\r\n  Our ardour less, as greater is our light.\r\n  How monstrous this in morals! Scarce more strange\r\n  Would this phenomenon in nature strike,\r\n  A sun, that froze her, or a star, that warm'd.\r\n  What taught these heroes of the moral world?                       998\r\n  To these thou givest thy praise, give credit too.\r\n  These doctors ne'er were pension'd to deceive thee;\r\n  And Pagan tutors are thy taste.--They taught,\r\n  That, narrow views betray to misery:\r\n  That, wise it is to comprehend the whole:\r\n  That, virtue, rose from nature, ponder'd well,\r\n  The single base of virtue built to heaven:\r\n  That God, and nature, our attention claim:\r\n  That nature is the glass reflecting God,\r\n  As, by the sea, reflected is the sun,\r\n  Too glorious to be gazed on in his sphere:\r\n  That, mind immortal loves immortal aims:                          1010\r\n  That, boundless mind affects a boundless space:\r\n  That vast surveys, and the sublime of things,\r\n  The soul assimilate, and make her great:\r\n  That, therefore, heaven her glories, as a fund\r\n  Of inspiration, thus spreads out to man.\r\n  Such are their doctrines; such the Night inspired.\r\n    And what more true? what truth of greater weight?\r\n  The soul of man was made to walk the skies;\r\n  Delightful outlet of her prison here!\r\n  There, disencumber'd from her chains, the ties                    1020\r\n  Of toys terrestrial, she can rove at large;\r\n  There, freely can respire, dilate, extend,\r\n  In full proportion let loose all her powers;\r\n  And, undeluded, grasp at something great.\r\n  Nor, as a stranger, does she wander there;\r\n  But, wonderful herself, through wonder strays;\r\n  Contemplating their grandeur, finds her own;\r\n  Dives deep in their economy divine,\r\n  Sits high in judgment on their various laws,\r\n  And, like a master, judges not amiss.                             1030\r\n  Hence greatly pleased, and justly proud, the soul\r\n  Grows conscious of her birth celestial; breathes                  1032\r\n  More life, more vigour, in her native air;\r\n  And feels herself at home amongst the stars;\r\n  And, feeling, emulates her country's praise.\r\n    What call we, then, the firmament, Lorenzo?--\r\n  As earth the body, since the skies sustain\r\n  The soul with food, that gives immortal life,\r\n  Call it, the noble pasture of the mind;\r\n  Which there expatiates, strengthens, and exults,                  1040\r\n  And riots through the luxuries of thought.\r\n  Call it, the garden of the Deity,\r\n  Blossom'd with stars, redundant in the growth\r\n  Of fruit ambrosial; moral fruit to man.\r\n  Call it, the breastplate of the true High Priest,\r\n  Ardent with gems oracular, that give,\r\n  In points of highest moment, right response;\r\n  And ill neglected, if we prize our peace.\r\n    Thus, have we found a true astrology;\r\n  Thus, have we found a new, and noble sense,                       1050\r\n  In which alone stars govern human fates.\r\n  O that the stars (as some have feign'd) let fall\r\n  Bloodshed, and havoc, on embattled realms,\r\n  And rescued monarchs from so black a guilt!\r\n  Bourbon! this wish how generous in a foe!\r\n  Would'st thou be great, would'st thou become a god,\r\n  And stick thy deathless name among the stars,\r\n  For mighty conquests on a needle's point?\r\n  Instead of forging chains for foreigners,\r\n  Bastile thy tutor: grandeur all thy aim?                          1060\r\n  As yet thou know'st not what it is: how great,\r\n  How glorious, then, appears the mind of man,\r\n  When in it all the stars, and planets, roll!\r\n  And what it seems, it is: great objects make\r\n  Great minds, enlarging as their views enlarge;                    1065\r\n  Those still more godlike, as these more divine.\r\n    And more divine than these, thou canst not see.\r\n  Dazzled, o'erpower'd, with the delicious draught\r\n  Of miscellaneous splendours, how I reel\r\n  From thought to thought, inebriate, without end!\r\n  An Eden, this! a Paradise unlost!\r\n  I meet the Deity in every view,                                   1072\r\n  And tremble at my nakedness before him!\r\n  O that I could but reach the tree of life!\r\n  For here it grows, unguarded from our taste;\r\n  No flaming sword denies our entrance here;\r\n  Would man but gather, he might live for ever.\r\n    Lorenzo! much of moral hast thou seen.\r\n  Of curious arts art thou more fond? Then mark\r\n  The mathematic glories of the skies,                              1080\r\n  In number, weight, and measure, all ordain'd.\r\n  Lorenzo's boasted builders, Chance, and Fate,\r\n  Are left to finish his aerial towers;\r\n  Wisdom and choice, their well-known characters\r\n  Here deep impress; and claim it for their own.\r\n  Though splendid all, no splendour void of use;\r\n  Use rivals beauty; art contends with power;\r\n  No wanton waste, amid effuse expense;\r\n  The great Economist adjusting all\r\n  To prudent pomp, magnificently wise.                              1090\r\n  How rich the prospect! and for ever new!\r\n  And newest to the man that views it most;\r\n  For newer still in infinite succeeds.\r\n  Then, these aerial racers, O how swift!\r\n  How the shaft loiters from the strongest string!\r\n  Spirit alone can distance the career.\r\n  Orb above orb ascending without end!\r\n  Circle in circle, without end, enclosed!\r\n  Wheel, within wheel; Ezekiel! like to thine!                      1099\r\n  Like thine, it seems a vision or a dream;\r\n  Though seen, we labour to believe it true!\r\n  What involution! what extent! what swarms\r\n  Of worlds, that laugh at earth! immensely great!\r\n  Immensely distant from each other's spheres!\r\n  What, then, the wondrous space through which they roll?\r\n  At once it quite engulfs all human thought;\r\n  'Tis comprehension's absolute defeat.\r\n    Nor think thou seest a wild disorder here;\r\n  Through this illustrious chaos to the sight,\r\n  Arrangement neat, and chastest order, reign.                      1110\r\n  The path prescribed, inviolably kept,\r\n  Upbraids the lawless sallies of mankind.\r\n  Worlds, ever thwarting, never interfere;\r\n  What knots are tied! how soon are they dissolved,\r\n  And set the seeming married planets free!\r\n  They rove for ever, without error rove;\r\n  Confusion unconfused! nor less admire\r\n  This tumult untumultuous; all on wing!\r\n  In motion, all! yet what profound repose!\r\n  What fervid action, yet no noise! as awed                         1120\r\n  To silence, by the presence of their Lord;\r\n  Or hush'd by His command, in love to man,\r\n  And bid let fall soft beams on human rest,\r\n  Restless themselves. On yon cerulean plain,\r\n  In exultation to their God, and thine,\r\n  They dance, they sing eternal jubilee,\r\n  Eternal celebration of His praise.\r\n  But, since their song arrives not at our ear,\r\n  Their dance perplex'd exhibits to the sight\r\n  Fair hieroglyphic of His peerless power.                          1130\r\n  Mark how the labyrinthian turns they take,\r\n  The circles intricate, and mystic maze,\r\n  Weave the grand cipher of Omnipotence;                            1133\r\n  To gods, how great! how legible to man!\r\n    Leaves so much wonder greater wonder still?\r\n  Where are the pillars that support the skies?\r\n  What more than Atlantean shoulder props\r\n  Th' incumbent load? What magic, what strange art,\r\n  In fluid air these ponderous orbs sustains?\r\n  Who would not think them hung in golden chains?--                 1140\r\n  And so they are; in the high will of heaven,\r\n  Which fixes all; makes adamant of air,\r\n  Or air of adamant; makes all of nought,\r\n  Or nought of all; if such the dread decree.\r\n    Imagine from their deep foundations torn\r\n  The most gigantic sons of earth, the broad\r\n  And towering Alps, all toss'd into the sea;\r\n  And, light as down, or volatile as air,\r\n  Their bulks enormous, dancing on the waves,\r\n  In time, and measure, exquisite; while all                        1150\r\n  The winds, in emulation of the spheres,\r\n  Tune their sonorous instruments aloft;\r\n  The concert swell, and animate the ball.\r\n  Would this appear amazing? What, then, worlds,\r\n  In a far thinner element sustain'd,\r\n  And acting the same part, with greater skill,\r\n  More rapid movement, and for noblest ends?\r\n    More obvious ends to pass, are not these stars\r\n  The seats majestic, proud imperial thrones,\r\n  On which angelic delegates of heaven,                             1160\r\n  At certain periods, as the Sovereign nods,\r\n  Discharge high trusts of vengeance, or of love;\r\n  To clothe, in outward grandeur, grand design,\r\n  And acts most solemn still more solemnize?\r\n  Ye citizens of air! what ardent thanks,\r\n  What full effusion of the grateful heart,\r\n  Is due from man indulged in such a sight!                         1167\r\n  A sight so noble! and a sight so kind!\r\n  It drops new truths at every new survey!\r\n  Feels not Lorenzo something stir within,\r\n  That sweeps away all period? As these spheres\r\n  Measure duration, they no less inspire\r\n  The godlike hope of ages without end.\r\n  The boundless space, through which these rovers take\r\n  Their restless roam, suggests the sister thought\r\n  Of boundless time. Thus, by kind Nature's skill,\r\n  To man unlabour'd, that important guest,\r\n  Eternity, finds entrance at the sight:\r\n  And an eternity, for man ordain'd,\r\n  Or these his destined midnight counsellors,                       1180\r\n  The stars, had never whisper'd it to man.\r\n  Nature informs, but ne'er insults, her sons.\r\n  Could she then kindle the most ardent wish\r\n  To disappoint it?--That is blasphemy.\r\n  Thus, of thy creed a second article,\r\n  Momentous, as th' existence of a God,\r\n  Is found (as I conceive) where rarely sought;\r\n  And thou may'st read thy soul immortal, here.\r\n    Here, then, Lorenzo! on these glories dwell;\r\n  Nor want the gilt, illuminated, roof,                             1190\r\n  That calls the wretched gay to dark delights.\r\n  Assemblies?--This is one divinely bright;\r\n  Here, unendanger'd in health, wealth, or fame,\r\n  Range through the fairest, and the Sultan scorn;\r\n  He, wise as thou, no crescent holds so fair,\r\n  As that, which on his turban awes a world;\r\n  And thinks the moon is proud to copy him.\r\n  Look on her, and gain more than worlds can give,\r\n  A mind superior to the charms of power.\r\n  Thou muffled in delusions of this life!                           1200\r\n  Can yonder moon turn ocean in his bed,                            1201\r\n  From side to side, in constant ebb, and flow,\r\n  And purify from stench his watery realms?\r\n  And fails her moral influence? wants she power\r\n  To turn Lorenzo's stubborn tide of thought\r\n  From stagnating on earth's infected shore,\r\n  And purge from nuisance his corrupted heart?\r\n  Fails her attraction when it draws to heaven?\r\n  Nay, and to what thou valuest more, earth's joy?\r\n  Minds elevate, and panting for unseen,                            1210\r\n  And defecate[66] from sense, alone obtain\r\n  Full relish of existence undeflower'd,\r\n  The life of life, the zest of worldly bliss:\r\n  All else on earth amounts--to what? to this:\r\n  \"Bad to be suffer'd; blessings to be left:\"\r\n  Earth's richest inventory boasts no more.\r\n    Of higher scenes be, then, the call obey'd.\r\n  O let me gaze!--Of gazing there's no end.\r\n  O let me think!--Thought too is wilder'd here;\r\n  In midway flight imagination tires;                               1220\r\n  Yet soon reprunes her wing to soar anew,\r\n  Her point unable to forbear, or gain;\r\n  So great the pleasure, so profound the plan!\r\n  A banquet, this, where men, and angels, meet,\r\n  Eat the same manna, mingle earth and heaven.\r\n  How distant some of these nocturnal suns!\r\n  So distant (says the sage), 'twere not absurd\r\n  To doubt, if beams, set out at Nature's birth,\r\n  Are yet arrived at this so foreign world;\r\n  Though nothing half so rapid as their flight.                     1230\r\n  An eye of awe and wonder let me roll,\r\n  And roll for ever: who can satiate sight\r\n  In such a scene? in such an ocean wide\r\n  Of deep astonishment? where depth, height, breadth,\r\n  Are lost in their extremes; and where to count                    1235\r\n  The thick-sown glories in this field of fire,\r\n  Perhaps a seraph's computation fails.\r\n  Now, go, Ambition! boast thy boundless might\r\n  In conquest, o'er the tenth part of a grain.\r\n    And yet Lorenzo calls for miracles,\r\n  To give his tottering faith a solid base.\r\n  Why call for less than is already thine?                          1242\r\n  Thou art no novice in theology;\r\n  What is a miracle?--'Tis a reproach,\r\n  'Tis an implicit satire, on mankind;\r\n  And while it satisfies, it censures too.\r\n  To common sense, great Nature's course proclaims\r\n  A Deity: when mankind falls asleep,\r\n  A miracle is sent, as an alarm;\r\n  To wake the world, and prove Him o'er again,                      1250\r\n  By recent argument, but not more strong.\r\n  Say, which imports more plenitude of power,\r\n  Or nature's laws to fix, or to repeal?\r\n  To make a sun, or stop his mid career?\r\n  To countermand his orders, and send back\r\n  The flaming courier to the frighted east,\r\n  Warm'd, and astonish'd, at his evening ray?\r\n  Or bid the moon, as with her journey tired,\r\n  In Ajalon's[67] soft, flowery vale repose?\r\n  Great things are these; still greater, to create.                 1260\r\n  From Adam's bower look down through the whole train\r\n  Of miracles;--resistless is their power?\r\n  They do not, can not, more amaze the mind,\r\n  Than this, call'd unmiraculous survey,\r\n  If duly weigh'd, if rationally seen,\r\n  If seen with human eyes. The brute, indeed,\r\n  Sees nought but spangles here; the fool, no more.\r\n  Say'st thou, \"The course of nature governs all?\"\r\n  The course of Nature is the art of God.                           1269\r\n  The miracles thou call'st for, this attest;\r\n  For say, could Nature Nature's course control?\r\n    But, miracles apart, who sees Him not,\r\n  Nature's controller, author, guide, and end?\r\n  Who turns his eye on Nature's midnight face,\r\n  But must inquire--\"What hand behind the scene,\r\n  What arm almighty, put these wheeling globes\r\n  In motion, and wound up the vast machine?\r\n  Who rounded in his palm these spacious orbs?\r\n  Who bowl'd them flaming through the dark profound,\r\n  Numerous as glittering gems of morning dew,                       1280\r\n  Or sparks from populous cities in a blaze,\r\n  And set the bosom of old Night on fire?\r\n  Peopled her desert, and made horror smile?\"\r\n  Or, if the military style delights thee\r\n  (For stars have fought their battles, leagued with man),\r\n  \"Who marshals this bright host? enrols their names?\r\n  Appoints their posts, their marches, and returns,\r\n  Punctual, at stated periods? who disbands\r\n  These veteran troops, their final duty done,\r\n  If e'er disbanded?\"--He, whose potent word,                       1290\r\n  Like the loud trumpet, levied first their powers\r\n  In Night's inglorious empire, where they slept\r\n  In beds of darkness: arm'd them with fierce flames,\r\n  Arranged, and disciplined, and clothed in gold;\r\n  And call'd them out of chaos to the field,\r\n  Where now they war with vice and unbelief.\r\n  O let us join this army! joining these,\r\n  Will give us hearts intrepid, at that hour,\r\n  When brighter flames shall cut a darker night;\r\n  When these strong demonstrations of a God                         1300\r\n  Shall hide their heads, or tumble from their spheres,\r\n  And one eternal curtain cover all!\r\n    Struck at that thought, as new awaked, I lift                   1303\r\n  A more enlighten'd eye, and read the stars\r\n  To man still more propitious; and their aid\r\n  (Though guiltless of idolatry) implore;\r\n  Nor longer rob them of their noblest name.\r\n  O ye dividers of my time! ye bright\r\n  Accountants of my days, and months, and years,\r\n  In your fair calendar distinctly mark'd!                          1310\r\n  Since that authentic, radiant register,\r\n  Though man inspects it not, stands good against him;\r\n  Since you, and years, roll on, though man stands still;\r\n  Teach me my days to number, and apply\r\n  My trembling heart to wisdom; now beyond\r\n  All shadow of excuse for fooling on.\r\n  Age smooths our path to prudence; sweeps aside\r\n  The snares keen appetite and passion spread\r\n  To catch stray souls; and woe to that grey head,\r\n  Whose folly would undo, what age has done!                        1320\r\n  Aid then, aid, all ye stars!--Much rather, Thou,\r\n  Great Artist! Thou, whose finger set aright\r\n  This exquisite machine, with all its wheels,\r\n  Though intervolved, exact; and pointing out\r\n  Life's rapid, and irrevocable flight,\r\n  With such an index fair, as none can miss,\r\n  Who lifts an eye, nor sleeps till it is closed.\r\n  Open mine eye, dread Deity! to read\r\n  The tacit doctrine of thy works; to see\r\n  Things as they are, unalter'd through the glass                   1330\r\n  Of worldly wishes. Time, eternity!\r\n  ('Tis these, mismeasured, ruin all mankind)\r\n  Set them before me; let me lay them both\r\n  In equal scale, and learn their various weight.\r\n  Let time appear a moment, as it is;\r\n  And let eternity's full orb, at once,\r\n  Turn on my soul, and strike it into heaven.                       1337\r\n  When shall I see far more than charms me now?\r\n  Gaze on creation's model in thy breast\r\n  Unveil'd, nor wonder at the transcript more?\r\n  When this vile, foreign, dust, which smothers all\r\n  That travel earth's deep vale, shall I shake off?\r\n  When shall my soul her incarnation quit,\r\n  And, readopted to thy bless'd embrace,\r\n  Obtain her apotheosis in Thee?\r\n    Dost think, Lorenzo, this is wandering wide?\r\n  No,'tis directly striking at the mark;\r\n  To wake thy dead devotion was my point;\r\n  And how I bless Night's consecrating shades,\r\n  Which to a temple turn an universe;                               1350\r\n  Fill us with great ideas, full of heaven,\r\n  And antidote the pestilential earth!\r\n  In every storm, that either frowns, or falls,\r\n  What an asylum has the soul in prayer!\r\n  And what a fane[68] is this, in which to pray!\r\n  And what a God must dwell in such a fane!\r\n  Oh, what a genius must inform the skies!\r\n  And is Lorenzo's salamander heart\r\n  Cold, and untouch'd, amid these sacred fires?\r\n  O ye nocturnal sparks! ye glowing embers,                         1360\r\n  On heaven's broad hearth! who burn, or burn no more,\r\n  Who blaze, or die, as Great Jehovah's breath\r\n  Or blows you, or forbears; assist my song;\r\n  Pour your whole influence; exorcise his heart,\r\n  So long possess'd; and bring him back to man.\r\n    And is Lorenzo a demurrer still?\r\n  Pride in thy parts provokes thee to contest\r\n  Truths, which, contested, put thy parts to shame.\r\n  Nor shame they more Lorenzo's head than heart,\r\n  A faithless heart, how despicably small!                          1370\r\n  Too strait, aught great or generous to receive!                   1371\r\n  Fill'd with an atom! fill'd, and foul'd, with self!\r\n  And self mistaken! self, that lasts an hour!\r\n  Instincts and passions, of the nobler kind,\r\n  Lie suffocated there; or they alone,\r\n  Reason apart, would wake high hope; and open,\r\n  To ravish'd thought, that intellectual sphere,\r\n  Where order, wisdom, goodness, providence,\r\n  Their endless miracles of love display,\r\n  And promise all the truly great desire.                           1380\r\n  The mind that would be happy, must be great;\r\n  Great, in its wishes; great, in its surveys.\r\n  Extended views a narrow mind extend;\r\n  Push out its corrugate, expansive make,\r\n  Which, ere long, more than planets shall embrace.\r\n  A man of compass makes a man of worth;\r\n  Divine contemplate, and become divine.\r\n    As man was made for glory, and for bliss,\r\n  All littleness is in approach to woe;\r\n  Open thy bosom, set thy wishes wide,                              1390\r\n  And let in manhood; let in happiness;\r\n  Admit the boundless theatre of thought\r\n  From nothing, up to God; which makes a man.\r\n  Take God from nature, nothing great is left;\r\n  Man's mind is in a pit, and nothing sees;\r\n  Man's heart is in a jakes[69], and loves the mire.\r\n  Emerge from thy profound; erect thine eye;\r\n  See thy distress! how close art thou besieged!\r\n  Besieged by Nature, the proud sceptic's foe!\r\n  Enclosed by these innumerable worlds,                             1400\r\n  Sparkling conviction on the darkest mind,\r\n  As in a golden net of Providence.\r\n  How art thou caught, sure captive of belief!\r\n  From this thy bless'd captivity, what art,\r\n  What blasphemy to reason, sets thee free!                         1405\r\n  This scene is heaven's indulgent violence:\r\n  Canst thou bear up against this tide of glory?\r\n  What is earth bosom'd in these ambient orbs,\r\n  But, faith in God imposed, and press'd on man?\r\n  Darest thou still litigate thy desperate cause,\r\n  Spite of these numerous, awful, witnesses,\r\n  And doubt the deposition of the skies?                            1412\r\n  O how laborious is thy way to ruin!\r\n    Laborious! 'tis impracticable quite;\r\n  To sink beyond a doubt, in this debate,\r\n  With all his weight of wisdom and of will,\r\n  And crime flagitious, I defy a fool.\r\n  Some wish they did; but no man disbelieves.\r\n  God is a spirit; spirit cannot strike\r\n  These gross, material organs; God by man                          1420\r\n  As much is seen, as man a God can see,\r\n  In these astonishing exploits of power.\r\n  What order, beauty, motion, distance, size!\r\n  Concertion of design, how exquisite!\r\n  How complicate, in their divine police!\r\n  Apt means! great ends! consent to general good!--\r\n  Each attribute of these material gods,\r\n  So long (and that with specious pleas) adored,\r\n  A separate conquest gains o'er rebel thought;\r\n  And leads in triumph the whole mind of man.                       1430\r\n    Lorenzo! this may seem harangue to thee;\r\n  Such all is apt to seem, that thwarts our will.\r\n  And dost thou, then, demand a simple proof\r\n  Of this great master moral of the skies,\r\n  Unskill'd, or disinclined, to read it there?\r\n  Since 'tis the basis, and all drops without it,\r\n  Take it, in one compact, unbroken chain.\r\n  Such proof insists on an attentive ear;\r\n  'Twill not make one amid a mob of thoughts,                       1439\r\n  And, for thy notice, struggle with the world.\r\n  Retire;--the world shut out;--thy thoughts call home;--\r\n  Imagination's airy wing repress;--\r\n  Lock up thy senses;--let no passion stir;--\r\n  Wake all to Reason;--let her reign alone;--\r\n  Then, in thy soul's deep silence, and the depth\r\n  Of Nature's silence, midnight, thus inquire,\r\n  As I have done; and shall inquire no more.\r\n  In nature's channel, thus the questions run:\r\n    \"What am I? and from whence?--I nothing know,\r\n  But that I am; and, since I am, conclude                          1450\r\n  Something eternal: had there e'er been nought,\r\n  Nought still had been: eternal there must be.--\r\n  But what eternal?--Why not human race?\r\n  And Adam's ancestors without an end?--\r\n  That's hard to be conceived; since every link\r\n  Of that long-chain'd succession is so frail;\r\n  Can every part depend, and not the whole?\r\n  Yet grant it true; new difficulties rise;\r\n  I'm still quite out at sea; nor see the shore.\r\n  Whence earth, and these bright orbs?--eternal too?\r\n  Grant matter was eternal; still these orbs                        1461\r\n  Would want some other father;--much design\r\n  Is seen in all their motions, all their makes;\r\n  Design implies intelligence, and art;\r\n  That can't be from themselves--or man; that art\r\n  Man scarce can comprehend, could man bestow?\r\n  And nothing greater yet allow'd than man.--\r\n  Who, motion, foreign to the smallest grain,\r\n  Shot through vast masses of enormous weight?\r\n  Who bid brute matter's restive lump assume                        1470\r\n  Such various forms, and gave it wings to fly?\r\n  Has matter innate motion? then each atom,\r\n  Asserting its indisputable right                                  1473\r\n  To dance, would form an universe of dust:\r\n  Has matter none? Then whence these glorious forms\r\n  And boundless flights, from shapeless, and reposed?\r\n  Has matter more than motion? Has it thought,\r\n  Judgment, and genius? Is it deeply learn'd\r\n  In mathematics? Has it framed such laws,\r\n  Which but to guess, a Newton made immortal?--                     1480\r\n  If so, how each sage atom laughs at me,\r\n  Who think a clod inferior to a man!\r\n  If art, to form; and counsel, to conduct;\r\n  And that with greater far than human skill;\r\n  Resides not in each block;--a Godhead reigns.--\r\n  Grant, then, invisible, eternal, Mind;\r\n  That granted, all is solved.--But, granting that,\r\n  Draw I not o'er me a still darker cloud?\r\n  Grant I not that which I can ne'er conceive?\r\n  A being without origin, or end!--                                 1490\r\n  Hail, human liberty! There is no God--\r\n  Yet, why? On either scheme that knot subsists;\r\n  Subsist it must, in God, or human race;\r\n  If in the last, how many knots beside,\r\n  Indissoluble all?--Why choose it there,\r\n  Where, chosen, still subsist ten thousand more?\r\n  Reject it, where, that chosen, all the rest\r\n  Dispersed, leave reason's whole horizon clear?\r\n  This is not reason's dictate; Reason says,\r\n  Close with the side where one grain turns the scale;--            1500\r\n  What vast preponderance is here! can reason\r\n  With louder voice exclaim--Believe a God?\r\n  And reason heard, is the sole mark of man.\r\n  What things impossible must man think true,\r\n  On any other system! and how strange\r\n  To disbelieve, through mere credulity!\"\r\n    If, in this chain, Lorenzo finds no flaw,                       1507\r\n  Let it for ever bind him to belief.\r\n  And where the link, in which a flaw he finds?\r\n  And, if a God there is, that God how great!\r\n  How great that Power, whose providential care\r\n  Through these bright orbs' dark centres darts a ray!\r\n  Of nature universal threads the whole!\r\n  And hangs creation, like a precious gem,\r\n  Though little, on the footstool of his throne!\r\n    That little gem, how large! A weight let fall\r\n  From a fix'd star, in ages can it reach\r\n  This distant earth! Say, then, Lorenzo! where,\r\n  Where, ends this mighty building? where, begin\r\n  The suburbs of creation? where, the wall                          1520\r\n  Whose battlements look o'er into the vale\r\n  Of non-existence! Nothing's strange abode!\r\n  Say, at what point of space Jehovah dropp'd\r\n  His slacken'd line, and laid his balance by;\r\n  Weigh'd worlds, and measured infinite, no more?\r\n  Where, rears His terminating pillar high\r\n  Its extra-mundane head? and says, to gods,\r\n  In characters illustrious as the sun,--\r\n\r\n    \"I stand, the plan's proud period; I pronounce\r\n    The work accomplish'd; the creation closed:                     1530\r\n    Shout, all ye gods! nor shout ye gods alone;\r\n    Of all that lives, or, if devoid of life,\r\n    That rests, or rolls, ye heights, and depths, resound!\r\n    Resound! resound! ye depths, and heights, resound!\"\r\n\r\n    Hard are those questions!--answer harder still.\r\n  Is this the sole exploit, the single birth,\r\n  The solitary son of power divine?\r\n  Or has th' Almighty Father, with a breath,\r\n  Impregnated the womb of distant space?                            1539\r\n  Has He not bid, in various provinces,\r\n  Brother-creations the dark bowels burst\r\n  Of night primeval; barren, now, no more?\r\n  And He the central sun, transpiercing all\r\n  Those giant generations, which disport\r\n  And dance, as motes, in his meridian ray;\r\n  That ray withdrawn, benighted, or absorb'd,\r\n  In that abyss of horror, whence they sprung;\r\n  While Chaos triumphs, repossess'd of all\r\n  Rival Creation ravish'd from his throne?\r\n  Chaos! of Nature both the womb, and grave!                        1550\r\n    Think'st thou my scheme, Lorenzo, spreads too wide?\r\n  Is this extravagant?--No; this is just;\r\n  Just, in conjecture, though 'twere false in fact.\r\n  If 'tis an error, 'tis an error sprung\r\n  From noble root, high thought of the Most High.\r\n  But wherefore error? who can prove it such?--\r\n  He that can set Omnipotence a bound.\r\n  Can man conceive beyond what God can do?\r\n  Nothing, but quite impossible is hard.\r\n  He summons into being, with like ease,                            1560\r\n  A whole creation, and a single grain.\r\n  Speaks he the word? a thousand worlds are born!\r\n  A thousand worlds? there's space for millions more:\r\n  And in what space can his great fiat fail?\r\n  Condemn me not, cold critic! but indulge\r\n  The warm imagination: why condemn?\r\n  Why not indulge such thoughts, as swell our hearts\r\n  With fuller admiration of that Power,\r\n  Who gives our hearts with such high thoughts to swell?\r\n  Why not indulge in His augmented praise?                          1570\r\n  Darts not His glory a still brighter ray,\r\n  The less is left to Chaos, and the realms\r\n  Of hideous Night, where Fancy strays aghast;                      1573\r\n  And, though most talkative, makes no report?\r\n    Still seems my thought enormous? Think again;--\r\n  Experience' self shall aid thy lame belief.\r\n  Glasses (that revelation to the sight!)\r\n  Have they not led us in the deep disclose\r\n  Of fine-spun nature, exquisitely small,\r\n  And, though demonstrated, still ill-conceived?                    1580\r\n  If, then, on the reverse, the mind would mount\r\n  In magnitude, what mind can mount too far,\r\n  To keep the balance, and creation poise?\r\n  Defect alone can err on such a theme;\r\n  What is too great, if we the cause survey?\r\n  Stupendous Architect! Thou, Thou art all!\r\n  My soul flies up and down in thoughts of Thee,\r\n  And finds herself but at the centre still!\r\n  I AM, thy name!

(for now fancy glows;\r\n  Fired in the vortex of almighty power)\r\n  Is not this home creation, in the map\r\n  Of universal nature, as a speck,\r\n  Like fair Britannia in our little ball;\r\n  Exceeding fair, and glorious, for its size,                       1600\r\n  But, elsewhere, far outmeasured, far outshone?\r\n  In fancy (for the fact beyond us lies)\r\n  Canst thou not figure it, an isle, almost\r\n  Too small for notice, in the vast of being;\r\n  Sever'd by mighty seas of unbuilt space\r\n  From other realms; from ample continents\r\n  Of higher life, where nobler natives dwell;                       1607\r\n  Less northern, less remote from Deity,\r\n  Glowing beneath the line of the Supreme;\r\n  Where souls in excellence make haste, put forth\r\n  Luxuriant growths; nor the late autumn wait\r\n  Of human worth, but ripen soon to gods?\r\n    Yet why drown fancy in such depths as these?\r\n  Return, presumptuous rover! and confess\r\n  The bounds of man; nor blame them, as too small.\r\n  Enjoy we not full scope in what is seen?\r\n  Pull ample the dominions of the sun!\r\n  Full glorious to behold! How far, how wide,\r\n  The matchless monarch, from his flaming throne,                   1619\r\n  Lavish of lustre, throws his beams about him,\r\n  Farther, and faster, than a thought can fly,\r\n  And feeds his planets with eternal fires!\r\n  This Heliopolis,[70] by greater far,\r\n  Than the proud tyrant of the Nile, was built;\r\n  And He alone, who built it, can destroy.\r\n  Beyond this city, why strays human thought?\r\n  One wonderful, enough for man to know!\r\n  One infinite! enough for man to range!\r\n  One firmament, enough for man to read!\r\n  O what voluminous instruction here!                               1630\r\n  What page of wisdom is denied him? None;\r\n  If learning his chief lesson makes him wise.\r\n  Nor is instruction, here, our only gain;\r\n  There dwells a noble pathos in the skies,\r\n  Which warms our passions, proselytes our hearts.\r\n  How eloquently shines the glowing pole!\r\n  With what authority it gives its charge,\r\n  Remonstrating great truths in style sublime,\r\n  Though silent, loud! heard earth around; above\r\n  The planets heard; and not unheard in hell;                       1640\r\n  Hell has her wonder, though too proud to praise.\r\n  Is earth, then, more infernal? Has she those,\r\n  Who neither praise (Lorenzo!) nor admire?\r\n    Lorenzo's admiration, pre-engaged,\r\n  Ne'er ask'd the moon one question; never held\r\n  Least correspondence with a single star;\r\n  Ne'er rear'd an altar to the Queen of Heaven\r\n  Walking in brightness; or her train adored.\r\n  Their sublunary rivals have long since\r\n  Engross'd his whole devotion; stars malign,                       1650\r\n  Which made the fond astronomer run mad;\r\n  Darken his intellect, corrupt his heart;\r\n  Cause him to sacrifice his fame and peace\r\n  To momentary madness, call'd delight.\r\n  Idolater, more gross than ever kiss'd\r\n  The lifted hand to Luna, or pour'd out\r\n  The blood to Jove!--O Thou, to whom belongs\r\n  All sacrifice! O Thou Great Jove unfeign'd!\r\n  Divine Instructor! Thy first volume, this,\r\n  For man's perusal; all in capitals!                               1660\r\n  In moon, and stars (heaven's golden alphabet!)\r\n  Emblazed to seize the sight; who runs, may read;\r\n  Who reads, can understand. 'Tis unconfined\r\n  To Christian land, or Jewry; fairly writ,\r\n  In language universal, to mankind:\r\n  A language, lofty to the learn'd: yet plain\r\n  To those that feed the flock, or guide the plough,\r\n  Or, from his husk, strike out the bounding grain.\r\n  A language, worthy the Great Mind, that speaks!\r\n  Preface, and comment, to the sacred page!                         1670\r\n  Which oft refers its reader to the skies,\r\n  As presupposing his first lesson there,\r\n  And Scripture self a fragment, that unread.\r\n  Stupendous book of wisdom, to the wise!                           1674\r\n  Stupendous book! and open'd, Night! by thee.\r\n    By thee much open'd, I confess, O Night!\r\n  Yet more I wish; but how shall I prevail?\r\n  Say, gentle Night! whose modest, maiden beams\r\n  Give us a new creation, and present\r\n  The world's great picture soften'd to the sight;\r\n  Nay, kinder far, far more indulgent still,\r\n  Say, thou, whose mild dominion's silver key                       1682\r\n  Unlocks our hemisphere, and sets to view\r\n  Worlds beyond number; worlds conceal'd by day\r\n  Behind the proud and envious star of noon!\r\n  Canst thou not draw a deeper scene?--and show\r\n  The mighty Potentate, to whom belong\r\n  These rich regalia pompously display'd\r\n  To kindle that high hope? Like him of Uz,[71]\r\n  I gaze around; I search on every side--                           1690\r\n  O for a glimpse of Him my soul adores!\r\n  As the chased hart, amid the desert waste,\r\n  Pants for the living stream; for Him who made her,\r\n  So pants the thirsty soul, amid the blank\r\n  Of sublunary joys. Say, goddess! where?\r\n  Where blazes His bright court? where burns His throne?\r\n  Thou know'st; for thou art near Him; by thee, round\r\n  His grand pavilion, sacred fame reports\r\n  The sable curtain drawn. If not, can none\r\n  Of thy fair daughter train, so swift of wing,                     1700\r\n  Who travel far, discover where He dwells?\r\n  A star His dwelling pointed out below.\r\n  Ye Pleiades!

Diminish'd earth recedes;\r\n  I pass the moon; and, from her farther side,\r\n  Pierce heaven's blue curtain; strike into remote;\r\n  Where, with his lifted tube, the subtle sage                      1720\r\n  His artificial, airy journey takes,\r\n  And to celestial lengthens human sight.\r\n  I pause at every planet on my road,\r\n  And ask for Him who gives their orbs to roll,\r\n  Their foreheads fair to shine. From Saturn's ring,\r\n  In which, of earths an army might be lost,\r\n  With the bold comet, take my bolder flight,\r\n  Amid those sovereign glories of the skies,\r\n  Of independent, native lustre, proud;\r\n  The souls of systems! and the lords of life,                      1730\r\n  Through their wide empires!--What behold I now?\r\n  A wilderness of wonder burning round;\r\n  Where larger suns inhabit higher spheres;\r\n  Perhaps the villas of descending gods;\r\n  Nor halt I here; my toil is but begun;\r\n  'Tis but the threshold of the Deity;\r\n  Or, far beneath it, I am grovelling still.\r\n  Nor is it strange; I built on a mistake;\r\n  The grandeur of his works, whence folly sought\r\n  For aid, to reason sets his glory higher;                         1740\r\n  Who built thus high for worms (mere worms to Him),\r\n  Oh, where, Lorenzo! must the Builder dwell?\r\n    Pause, then; and, for a moment, here respire--\r\n  If human thought can keep its station here.\r\n  Where am I?--Where is earth?--Nay, where art thou,\r\n  O sun?--Is the sun turn'd recluse?--and are\r\n  His boasted expeditions short to mine?--\r\n  To mine, how short!

Or mortals here, or gods?\r\n  Ye borderers on the coasts of bliss! what are you?\r\n  A colony from heaven? or, only raised,\r\n  By frequent visit from heaven's neighbouring realms,\r\n  To secondary gods, and half divine?--\r\n  Whate'er your nature, this is past dispute,\r\n  Far other life you live, far other tongue\r\n  You talk, far other thought, perhaps, you think,\r\n  Than man. How various are the works of God?\r\n  But say, what thought? Is Reason here enthroned,                  1770\r\n  And absolute? or Sense in arms against her?\r\n  Have you two lights? Or need you no reveal'd?\r\n  Enjoy your happy realms their golden age?\r\n  And had your Eden an abstemious Eve?                              1774\r\n  Our Eve's fair daughters prove their pedigree,\r\n  And ask their Adams--'Who would not be wise?'\r\n  Or, if your mother fell, are you redeem'd?\r\n  And if redeem'd--is your Redeemer scorn'd?\r\n  Is this your final residence? If not,\r\n  Change you your scene, translated? or by death?\r\n  And if by death; what death?--Know you disease?\r\n  Or horrid war?--With war, this fatal hour,                        1782\r\n  Europa groans (so call we a small field,\r\n  Where kings run mad). In our world, Death deputes\r\n  Intemperance to do the work of Age;\r\n  And hanging up the quiver Nature gave him,\r\n  As slow of execution, for despatch\r\n  Sends forth imperial butchers; bids them slay\r\n  Their sheep (the silly sheep they fleeced before),\r\n  And toss him twice ten thousand at a meal.                        1790\r\n  Sit all your executioners on thrones?\r\n  With you, can rage for plunder make a god?\r\n  And bloodshed wash out every other stain?--\r\n  But you, perhaps, can't bleed: from matter gross\r\n  Your spirits clean, are delicately clad\r\n  In fine-spun ether, privileged to soar,\r\n  Unloaded, uninfected; how unlike\r\n  The lot of man! how few of human race\r\n  By their own mud unmurder'd! how we wage\r\n  Self-war eternal!--Is your painful day                            1800\r\n  Of hardy conflict o'er? or, are you still\r\n  Raw candidates at school? and have you those\r\n  Who disaffect reversions, as with us?--\r\n  But what are we? You never heard of man;\r\n  Or earth, the bedlam of the universe!\r\n  Where Reason (undiseased with you) runs mad,\r\n  And nurses Folly's children as her own;\r\n  Fond of the foulest. In the sacred mount                          1808\r\n  Of holiness, where Reason is pronounced\r\n  Infallible; and thunders, like a god;\r\n  Even there, by saints, the demons are outdone;\r\n  What these think wrong, our saints refine to right;\r\n  And kindly teach dull hell her own black arts;\r\n  Satan, instructed, o'er their morals smiles.--\r\n  But this, how strange to you, who know not man!\r\n  Has the least rumour of our race arrived?\r\n  Call'd here Elijah in his flaming car?\r\n  Pass'd by you the good Enoch, on his road\r\n  To those fair fields, whence Lucifer was hurl'd;\r\n  Who brush'd, perhaps, your sphere in his descent,                 1820\r\n  Stain'd your pure crystal ether, or let fall\r\n  A short eclipse from his portentous shade?\r\n  O that the fiend had lodged on some broad orb\r\n  Athwart his way; nor reach'd his present home,\r\n  Then blacken'd earth with footsteps foul'd in hell,\r\n  Nor wash'd in ocean, as from Rome he pass'd\r\n  To Britain's isle; too, too, conspicuous there!\"\r\n    But this is all digression: where is He,\r\n  That o'er heaven's battlements the felon hurl'd\r\n  To groans, and chains, and darkness? Where is He,                 1830\r\n  Who sees creation's summit in a vale?\r\n  He, whom, while man is man, he can't but seek;\r\n  And if he finds, commences more than man?\r\n  O for a telescope His throne to reach!\r\n  Tell me, ye learn'd on earth! or blest above!\r\n  Ye searching, ye Newtonian angels! tell.\r\n  Where, your Great Master's orb? His planets, where?\r\n  Those conscious satellites, those morning stars,\r\n  First-born of Deity! from central love,\r\n  By veneration most profound, thrown off;                          1840\r\n  By sweet attraction, no less strongly drawn;\r\n  Awed, and yet raptured; raptured, yet serene;                     1842\r\n  Past thought illustrious, but with borrow'd beams;\r\n  In still approaching circles, still remote,\r\n  Revolving round the sun's eternal Sire?\r\n  Or sent, in lines direct, on embassies\r\n  To nations--in what latitude?--Beyond\r\n  Terrestrial thought's horizon!--And on what\r\n  High errands sent?--Here human effort ends;\r\n  And leaves me still a stranger to His throne.                     1850\r\n    Full well it might! I quite mistook my road.\r\n  Born in an age more curious than devout;\r\n  More fond to fix the place of heaven, or hell,\r\n  Than studious this to shun, or that secure.\r\n  'Tis not the curious, but the pious path,\r\n  That leads me to my point: Lorenzo! know,\r\n  Without or star, or angel, for their guide,\r\n  Who worship God, shall find him. Humble Love,\r\n  And not proud Reason, keeps the door of heaven;\r\n  Love finds admission, where proud Science fails.                  1860\r\n  Man's science is the culture of his heart;\r\n  And not to lose his plummet in the depths\r\n  Of nature, or the more profound of God.\r\n  Either to know, is an attempt that sets\r\n  The wisest on a level with the fool.\r\n  To fathom nature (ill attempted here!)\r\n  Past doubt is deep philosophy above;\r\n  Higher degrees in bliss archangels take,\r\n  As deeper learn'd; the deepest, learning still.\r\n  For, what a thunder of omnipotence                                1870\r\n  (So might I dare to speak) is seen in all!\r\n  In man! in earth! in more amazing skies!\r\n  Teaching this lesson, Pride is loath to learn--\r\n  \"Not deeply to discern, not much to know,\r\n  Mankind was born to wonder, and adore.\"\r\n    And is there cause for higher wonder still,                     1876\r\n  Than that which struck us from our past surveys?\r\n  Yes; and for deeper adoration too.\r\n  From my late airy travel unconfined,\r\n  Have I learn'd nothing?--Yes, Lorenzo! this:\r\n  Each of these stars is a religious house;\r\n  I saw their altars smoke, their incense rise;\r\n  And heard hosannas ring through every sphere,                     1883\r\n  A seminary fraught with future gods.\r\n  Nature all o'er is consecrated ground,\r\n  Teeming with growths immortal, and divine.\r\n  The Great Proprietor's all-bounteous hand\r\n  Leaves nothing waste; but sows these fiery fields\r\n  With seeds of reason, which to virtues rise\r\n  Beneath His genial ray; and, if escaped                           1890\r\n  The pestilential blasts of stubborn will,\r\n  When grown mature, are gather'd for the skies.\r\n  And is devotion thought too much on earth,\r\n  When beings, so superior, homage boast,\r\n  And triumph in prostrations to the Throne?\r\n    But wherefore more of planets, or of stars?\r\n  Ethereal journeys, and, discover'd there,\r\n  Ten thousand worlds, ten thousand ways devout,\r\n  All nature sending incense to the Throne,\r\n  Except the bold Lorenzos of our sphere?                           1900\r\n  Opening the solemn sources of my soul,\r\n  Since I have pour'd, like feign'd Eridanus,[72]\r\n  My flowing numbers o'er the flaming skies,\r\n  Nor see, of fancy, or of fact, what more\r\n  Invites the Muse.--Here turn we, and review\r\n  Our past nocturnal landscape wide:--then say,\r\n  Say, then, Lorenzo! with what burst of heart,\r\n  The whole, at once, revolving in his thought,\r\n  Must man exclaim, adoring, and aghast?                            1909\r\n  \"Oh, what a root! Oh, what a branch, is here!\r\n  Oh, what a Father! what a family!\r\n  Worlds! systems! and creations!--and creations,\r\n  In one agglomerated cluster, hung,\r\n  Great Vine![73] on Thee, on Thee the cluster hangs;\r\n  The filial cluster! infinitely spread\r\n  In glowing globes, with various being fraught;\r\n  And drinks (nectareous draught!) immortal life.\r\n  Or, shall I say (for who can say enough?)\r\n  A constellation of ten thousand gems,\r\n  (And, oh! of what dimension! of what weight!)                     1920\r\n  Set in one signet, flames on the right hand\r\n  Of Majesty Divine!

Non-Subscribers\r\ncan obtain the Volumes separately at 4s. 6d. each.\r\n\r\n Subscribers' Names received by all Booksellers for the Yearly Issue of\r\n                         Six Vols. for L1, 1s.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Publisher has pleasure in submitting the following Extracts from\r\nrecent Notices which have appeared of the Vols. already issued:_--\r\n\r\n                           Literary Gazette.\r\n\r\nColeridge said, that for a man fully to appreciate George Herbert, he\r\nmust be \"an affectionate and dutiful son of the Church, and from habit,\r\nconviction, and a constitutional predisposition to ceremoniousness in\r\npiety as in manners, find her forms and ordinances aids of religion, not\r\nsources of formality.\" Mr Gilfillan has none of the qualifications here\r\ndescribed, yet never was the character of Herbert more highly\r\nappreciated, nor his poetry more unreservedly admired, than by this\r\nPresbyterian editor. The editorial work is done with true Christian\r\nliberality, and with the sympathy of a man of genius. The present volume\r\nforms one of the new series of the \"English Poetical Classics,\" published\r\nby Mr Nichol of Edinburgh. In typography and appearance they are very\r\nsuperior, and they are issued at a price of unusual cheapness. The series\r\nwill form a beautiful and valuable library edition of the English Classic\r\nPoets.\r\n\r\n                            Scottish Review.\r\n\r\nIn this age of puffs and puffing, it is really pleasing to find\r\npretensions at first somewhat startling, though modestly enough\r\nproclaimed, so well sustained. Six such volumes for twenty-one shillings!\r\nWe are not surprised that they are said to be \"offered at about one-third\r\nof the usual selling price.\" Independently altogether of the original\r\nmatter furnished by Mr Gilfillan, the poetical works of John Milton,\r\nproduced in such a style, are certainly worthy of a place in the best\r\nlibraries. We know of no issue from the press which, as to paper, type,\r\nand general getting up, commends itself to public favour at so small a\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n                            Eclectic Review.\r\n\r\nThe proposal issued by Mr Nichol is remarkable even in this age of cheap\r\nliterature, and will go far to supply what has been long needed,--an\r\naccurate, elegant, and cheap edition of our Poets. Such a guinea's worth\r\nwas never issued before, and we are much mistaken if the series does not\r\nobtain a large circulation. The volumes are issued in handsome style, and\r\nevery care will be taken to secure the accuracy of the editions. Mr\r\nGilfillan's temperament involves some of the choicest elements of poetic\r\nimpressions, while his critical canons are for the most part sound and\r\ntrustworthy.\r\n\r\n                          Perthshire Courier.\r\n\r\nIt is almost unnecessary for us to say more than what is now universally\r\nadmitted, that this is the best and cheapest edition of the British Poets\r\never offered to the public. Setting aside their acknowledged and standard\r\nelegance, they are the cheapest books we have ever seen, and their being\r\nindispensable to the literary man, as well as the educated gentleman or\r\nwell-read artisan, makes them doubly so.\r\n\r\n                            Tait's Magazine.\r\n\r\nThese volumes form part of a new series of the \"British Poets,\" published\r\nby Mr Nichol, in the form of substantial and elegant library volumes, at\r\na price less than one third of that which the public have been accustomed\r\nto pay for tomes of such goodly parts and quality. Paper, print, and\r\nbinding, are all excellent, the type large and clear.... The above\r\nextracts, more than anything we could say, will commend these volumes,\r\nand the series of which they form a part, to the good opinion of the\r\nreader. As a cheap and excellent library edition of the \"British Poets,\"\r\nthey will prove acceptable to a very numerous class; and under the\r\nmanagement of their present able editor, we cannot harbour a doubt of\r\ntheir success with the public.\r\n\r\n                              The Monitor.\r\n\r\nWhen it was proposed that, at so low a price as a subscription of a\r\nguinea in the year, six volumes, in a superior style of execution, would\r\nbe issued, we could not but admire the enterprise of the publisher, and\r\nheartily wish all success to the undertaking.\r\n\r\nThese volumes, the first in the series, fully justified our fondest\r\nanticipations, and give large promise that this admirable publication\r\nwill secure, as it certainly deserves, extensive patronage. They are\r\nissued in a very attractive style--in a large bold type, paper of the\r\nbest quality, and in neat and substantial binding. The editorial part of\r\nthe undertaking is carefully and ably executed. Indeed, we know no living\r\nperson who is better qualified to edit a uniform edition of the British\r\nPoets than the Rev. George Gilfillan. We tender to both the publisher and\r\neditor of this beautiful superior edition of the British Poets our\r\ngrateful acknowledgments for commencing so important and valuable an\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\n                          Clydesdale Journal.\r\n\r\nThis series has now reached the fourth volume, and is fully sustaining\r\nthe very favourable opinion expressed by the press in all parts of the\r\ncountry. Never was a work issued combining elegance and cheapness in so\r\nremarkable a degree.\r\n\r\n                        Bell's Weekly Messenger.\r\n\r\nThis volume is an additional proof of the excellency of the selection,\r\nthe ability of the gifted editor, and the elegance of the publication.\r\n\r\n                          Cumberland Pacquet.\r\n\r\nThis is the fourth volume of the library edition of the British Poets,\r\nprojected by Mr Nichol, the enterprising Edinburgh publisher, one or two\r\nof the former volumes of which we have already had the pleasure of\r\nnoticing. The design, and the style in which it was proposed to carry it\r\nout, as indicated by the first volume of the series, elicited the\r\nexpression of our special admiration several months ago, and we have\r\npleasure in stating that the volume now before us is in every respect a\r\nworthy successor to those which have preceded it. We may observe that the\r\ncritical dissertation prefixed, from the pen of Mr Gilfillan, is worth\r\nthe price of the entire volume.\r\n\r\n                           Aberdeen Journal.\r\n\r\n... A few words respecting the series of publications of which this\r\nvolume forms a part. They are issued, as our readers are aware, under the\r\nvery efficient superintendence of George Gilfillan; and we cannot speak\r\nof them but in terms of the warmest approval; for, in point of form and\r\nelegance, and correctness of typography, they are on a level with the\r\nhigh-priced editions; and in point of price, they are on a level with the\r\nmost ordinary publications of popular works that have been got up for the\r\npopular market. The enterprise is indeed a noble one, and we wish it all\r\nmanner of success.\r\n\r\n                   Dumfriesshire and Galloway Herald.\r\n\r\nThis is the fourth volume of the new Edinburgh edition of the Poets--an\r\nedition, we must say, alike honourable to the publisher and editor. Mr\r\nNichol's undertaking is a noble one. We wish him all success in it.\r\n\r\n                            Glasgow Citizen.\r\n\r\nThe edition before us, with its ample page and masculine type--very\r\nsuitable for feeble eyes--forms part of Nichol's fine and wonderfully\r\ncheap issue of the British Poets, under the able editorship of Mr\r\nGilfillan. Four volumes are now out, comprising the works of Milton,\r\nThomson, and Herbert.\r\n\r\n                          Newcastle Chronicle.\r\n\r\nThe paper and printing of this volume, as of the others, are, however,\r\nbeyond all praise, when compared with other \"people's editions.\"\r\n\r\n                Montrose, Arbroath, and Brechin Review.\r\n\r\nThe editorial part is admirably performed by Mr Gilfillan; the getting up\r\nquite the _ne plus ultra_ of elegance and correctness; and the price (six\r\nvolumes for a guinea) is perhaps the very greatest marvel of this\r\nmarvellous age of cheap publications.\r\n\r\n                             Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nRegarded as specimens of typography--as books, in short, in the mere\r\nsense of what is mechanical, they are among the most perfect we have\r\nseen. This new edition of the British Poets is an undertaking which is\r\nworthy of commendation and encouragement, even apart from the\r\nconsiderations to which we have alluded.\r\n\r\n                        The National Miscellany.\r\n\r\nIt is a bold speculation on the part of a publisher to offer six handsome\r\nand well printed volumes for a guinea.... The printing, binding, and\r\ngeneral appearance is far superior to what we could have at all expected\r\nfor the price; and the series being issued under the superintendence of a\r\ncareful editor, entirely fulfils the import of the title, a Library\r\nEdition. The works which have already appeared, are those of Milton,\r\nHerbert, and Thomson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             Transcriber's Notes to this Electronic Edition\r\n\r\n\r\n--Several palpable typos in the original were silently corrected, after\r\n  consulting other printed editions.\r\n\r\n--In the Distributed Proofreaders community, it is customary to flag any\r\n  aspect of the text that seems wrong, for the final editor to\r\n  double-check. It's also customary for later proofreaders to provide\r\n  their own analysis. On this project, those proofers' notes--as\r\n  explanations of why the printed text was correct--so often proved\r\n  enlightening as to its meaning, that the postprocessor retained them as\r\n  footnotes. They are distinguished from the original editor's notes by a\r\n  suffix \"--ee\" (\"electronic edition\").",
