DOWLING, A. Ph.D.,\r\n\r\nSCRIBE TO THE MESSENGER.\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE BOOK._\r\n\r\nThe full title of this book is “The Aquarian Age Gospel of Jesus,\r\nthe Christ of the Piscean Age,” and the critical reader is apt to\r\nask a number of pertinent questions concerning it. Among the many\r\nanticipated questions these are perhaps the most important:\r\n\r\n  1  What is an Age?\r\n  2  What is the Piscean Age?\r\n  3  What is the Aquarian Age?\r\n  4  What is meant by the Christ as the word is used in this book?\r\n  5  What relationship existed between Jesus of Nazareth and the Christ?\r\n  6  Who is Levi, the transcriber of this book?\r\n  7  What are the Akashic Records?\r\n\r\n1 _What is an Age?_ Astronomers tell us that our sun and his family\r\nof planets revolve around a central sun, which is millions of miles\r\ndistant, and that it requires something less than 26,000 years to make\r\none revolution. His orbit is called the Zodiac, which is divided into\r\ntwelve signs, familiarly known as Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo,\r\nVirgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces.\r\nIt requires our Solar System a little more than 2100 years to pass\r\nthrough one of these signs, and this time is the measurement of an Age\r\nor Dispensation. Because of what Astronomers call “the precession of\r\nthe Equinoxes” the movement of the sun through the signs of the Zodiac\r\nis in order reverse from that given above.\r\n\r\n_Exact Time of the Beginning of an Age._ Regarding this matter there\r\nis a disagreement among astronomers; but in this Introduction we are\r\nnot called upon to give the reasons of the various investigators for\r\ntheir opinions; there are enough well authenticated facts for our\r\npresent purposes. It is conceded by all critical students that the sun\r\nentered the zodiacal sign Taurus in the days of our historic Adam when\r\nthe Taurian Age began; that Abraham lived not far from the beginning\r\nof the Arian Age, when the sun entered the sign Aries. About the time\r\nof the rise of the Roman empire the sun entered the sign Pisces, the\r\nFishes, and the Piscean Age began, so that early in this Age Jesus of\r\nNazareth lived.\r\n\r\n2 _What is the Piscean Age?_ This question requires further\r\nconsideration. The Piscean Age is identical with the Christian\r\nDispensation. The word Pisces means fish. The sign is known as a water\r\nsign, and the Piscean Age has been distinctly the age of the fish and\r\nits element, water.\r\n\r\nIn the establishment of their great institutions John the Harbinger\r\nand Jesus both introduced the rite of water baptism, which has been\r\nused in some form in all the so-called Christian Churches and cults,\r\neven to the present time. Water is the true symbol of purification.\r\nJesus himself said to the Harbinger before he was baptized: “All men\r\nmust be washed, symbolic of the cleansing of the soul.” (Aquarian\r\nGospel 64:7.)\r\n\r\n_Fish was a Christian Symbol._ In the earlier centuries of the\r\nChristian Dispensation the fish was everywhere used as a symbol. In\r\nhis remarkable book, “Christian Iconography,” Didron says:\r\n\r\n“The fish, in the opinion of antiquarians generally, is the symbol\r\nof Jesus Christ. The fish is sculptured upon a number of Christian\r\nmonuments, and more particularly upon the ancient sarcophagi. It\r\nis also upon medals, bearing the name of our Savior and also upon\r\nengraved stones, cameos and intaglios. The fish is also to be remarked\r\nupon the amulets worn suspended from the necks by children, and upon\r\nancient glasses and sculptured lamps.\r\n\r\n“Baptismal fonts are more particularly ornamented with the fish. The\r\nfish is constantly exhibited placed upon a dish in the middle of the\r\ntable, at the Last Supper, among the loaves, knives and cups used at\r\nthe banquet.”\r\n\r\nIn the writings of Tertullian we find this statement: “We are little\r\nfishes in Christ our great fish.”\r\n\r\nThe last two thousand years, comprising the Piscean Age, has certainly\r\nbeen one of water and the many uses of that element have been\r\nemphasized, and sea and lake and river navigation has been brought to\r\na high degree of efficiency.\r\n\r\n3 _What is the Aquarian Age?_ The human race is today standing upon\r\nthe cusp of the Piscean-Aquarian Ages. Aquarius is an air sign and the\r\nNew Age is already noted for remarkable inventions for the use of air,\r\nelectricity, magnetism, etc. Men navigate the air as fish do the sea,\r\nand send their thoughts spinning around the world with the speed of\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\nThe word Aquarius is derived from the Latin word aqua, meaning water.\r\nAquarius is, however, the _water bearer_, and the symbol of the sign,\r\nwhich is the eleventh sign of the Zodiac, is a man carrying in his\r\nright hand a pitcher of water. Jesus referred to the beginning of the\r\nAquarian Age in these words:\r\n\r\n“And then the man who bears the pitcher will walk forth across an arc\r\nof heaven; the sign and signet of the Son of Man will stand forth in\r\nthe eastern sky. The wise will then lift up their heads and know that\r\nthe redemption of the earth is near.” (Aquarian Gospel 157:29, 30.)\r\n\r\nThe Aquarian Age is pre-eminently a spiritual age, and the spiritual\r\nside of the great lessons that Jesus gave to the world may now be\r\ncomprehended by multitudes of people for the many are now coming into\r\nan advanced stage of spiritual consciousness; so with much propriety\r\nthis book is called “The Aquarian (or Spiritual) Gospel of Jesus, the\r\nChrist.”\r\n\r\n_An Important Event._ The transfer of dominion from one Age to another\r\nis an important event in the world of Cherubim and Seraphim. Among the\r\nmanuscripts of Levi we have found a most remarkable paper describing\r\nthe transfer of dominion from the Piscean Age to the Aquarian Age, but\r\nit is difficult to determine whether it is a recital of facts or a\r\nprophetic statement. We reproduce the paper in full.\r\n\r\n    THE CUSP OF THE AGES.\r\n\r\n    “In Spirit I was caught away into the realms of Akasha; I stood\r\n    alone within the circle of the sun.\r\n\r\n    “And there I found the secret spring that opens up the door to\r\n    Wisdom and an understanding heart.\r\n\r\n    “I entered in and then I knew.\r\n\r\n    “I saw the four and twenty Cherubim and Seraphim that guard\r\n    the circle of the sun, the mighty ones who were proclaimed by\r\n    masters long ago ‘the four and twenty ancient ones.’\r\n\r\n    “I heard the names of every Cherubim and Seraphim, and learned\r\n    that every sign in all the Zodiac is ruled by two--a Cherubim\r\n    and Seraphim.\r\n\r\n    “And then I stood upon the cusp where Ages meet. The Piscean\r\n    Age had passed; the Aquarian Age had just begun.\r\n\r\n    “I saw the guardian Spirits of the Piscean Age; Ramasa is the\r\n    Cherubim; Vacabiel is Seraphim.\r\n\r\n    “I saw the guardian Spirits of the Aquarian Age, and Archer is\r\n    the Cherubim; Sakmaquil is the Seraphim.\r\n\r\n    “These four great spirits of the Triune God stood close\r\n    together on the cusp, and in the presence of the sacred\r\n    Three--the God of Might, the God of Wisdom, and the God of\r\n    Love--the scepter of Domain, of Might, of Wisdom and of Love\r\n    was there transferred.\r\n\r\n    “I heard the charges of the Triune God; but these I may not now\r\n    reveal.\r\n\r\n    “I heard the history of the Piscean Age from Piscean Cherubim\r\n    and Seraphim, and when I took my pen to write Ramasa said:\r\n\r\n    “Not now, my son, not now; but you may write it down for men\r\n    when men have learned the sacred laws of Brotherhood, of Peace\r\n    on earth, good-will to every living thing.\r\n\r\n    “And then I heard the Aquarian Cherubim and Seraphim proclaim\r\n    the Gospel of the coming Age, the age of Wisdom, of the Son of\r\n    Man.\r\n\r\n    “And when the crown was lifted from the head of Ramasa and\r\n    placed upon the head of Archer of the Aquarian Age; and when\r\n    the royal scepter was transferred from Seraphim Vacabiel to\r\n    Seraphim Sakmaquil there was deep silence in the courts of\r\n    heaven.\r\n\r\n    “And then the goddess Wisdom spoke, and with her hands\r\n    outstretched she poured the benedictions of the Holy Breath\r\n    upon the rulers of Aquarius.\r\n\r\n    “I may not write the words she spoke, but I may tell the Gospel\r\n    of the coming age that Archer told when he received the crown.\r\n\r\n    “And I may breathe to men the song of praise that Seraphim\r\n    Sakmaquil sung when she received the royal scepter of the\r\n    newborn age.\r\n\r\n    “This Gospel I will tell, and I will sing this song in every\r\n    land, to all the people, tribes and tongues of earth.”\r\n\r\n4 _What is Meant by “the Christ,” as the Word is Used in This Book?_\r\nThe word Christ is derived from the Greek word Kristos and means\r\nanointed. It is identical with the Hebrew word Messiah. The word\r\nChrist, per se, does not refer to any particular person; every\r\nanointed person is christed. When the definite article “the” is placed\r\nbefore the word christ a definite personality is indicated, and this\r\npersonality is none other than a member of the Trinity, the Son who\r\nhad a glory with the Father-Mother before the worlds were formed.\r\n\r\nAccording to the teachings of all ancient masters this Son is Love; so\r\nthe Christ is Love, and Love is God, since God is Love.\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable manuscript found in Levi’s Akashic portfolio\r\ngives the clearest possible ideal of the Christ, or Love of God. It\r\nis presumed that this manuscript is a direct transcription from the\r\nAkashic Records and its importance demands its reproduction here in\r\nfull.\r\n\r\n    THE CHRIST\r\n\r\n    “Before creation was the Christ walked with the Father God and\r\n    Mother God in Akasha.\r\n\r\n    “The Christ is son, the only son begotten by Almighty God, the\r\n    God of Force and God omniscient, God of thought; and Christ is\r\n    God, the God of Love.\r\n\r\n    “Without the Christ there was no light. Through Christ all life\r\n    was manifest; and so through him all things were done, and\r\n    naught was done in forming worlds or peopling worlds without\r\n    the Christ.\r\n\r\n    “Christ is the Logos of Infinities and through the word alone\r\n    are Thought and Force made manifest.\r\n\r\n    “The Son is called the Christ, because the Son, the Love, the\r\n    universal Love, was set apart, ordained to be creator, Lord,\r\n    preserver and redeemer of all things, of everything that is, or\r\n    evermore will be.\r\n\r\n    “Through Christ, the protoplast, the earth, the plant, the\r\n    beast, the man, the angel and the cherubim took up their\r\n    stations on their planes of life.\r\n\r\n    “Through Christ they are preserved; and if they fall it is the\r\n    Christ who lifts them up; and if they sell themselves to sin\r\n    the Christ redeems.\r\n\r\n    “Now Christ, the universal Love, pervades all spaces of\r\n    infinity, and so there is no end to love.\r\n\r\n    “From the great heart of Love unnumbered spirits were sent\r\n    forth to demonstrate the height, the depth, the width, the\r\n    boundlessness of Love.\r\n\r\n    “To every world and star and moon and sun a master spirit of\r\n    this Love divine was sent; and all were full anointed with the\r\n    oil of helpfulness, and each became a Christ.\r\n\r\n    “All glorious in his majesty is Christ, who spread the pure\r\n    white robe of Love o’er all the planes of earth--The Christ of\r\n    earth, its heaven, its graves.\r\n\r\n    “In course of time the protoplast, the earth, the plant, the\r\n    beast, the man sold out their birthrights unto sin; but Christ\r\n    was present to redeem.\r\n\r\n    “Hid in the holiest place in all infinities is locked the\r\n    scroll that bears the record of the purposes of God, the Triune\r\n    God, and there we read:\r\n\r\n    “Perfection is the ultimate of life. A seed is perfect in its\r\n    embryotic life, but it is destined to unfold, to grow.\r\n\r\n    “Into the soil of every plane these seeds, which were the\r\n    Thoughts of God, were cast--the seeds of protoplast, of earth,\r\n    of plant, of beast, of man, of angel and of cherubim, and they\r\n    who sowed the seeds, through Christ, ordained that they should\r\n    grow, and should return at last, by effort of unnumbered years,\r\n    to the great granary of thought, and each be a perfection of\r\n    its kind.\r\n\r\n    “And in the boundless blessedness of Love the man was made the\r\n    Lord of protoplast, of earth, of plant, of beast; and Christ\r\n    proclaimed: Man shall have full dominion over everything that\r\n    is upon these planes of life; and it was so.\r\n\r\n    “And he who gave the lordship unto man declared that he must\r\n    rule by Love.\r\n\r\n    “But men grew cruel and they lost their power to rule, and\r\n    protoplast, and earth, and plant and beast became at enmity\r\n    with man; he lost his heritage; but Christ was present to\r\n    redeem.\r\n\r\n    “But man had lost his consciousness of right; he could no\r\n    longer comprehend the boundlessness of Love; he could see\r\n    naught but self, and things of self; but Christ was there to\r\n    seek the lost and save.\r\n\r\n    “So that he might be close to man in all the ways of life, that\r\n    man might comprehend the mighty spirit of the Love, the Christ\r\n    of earth made manifest to human eyes and ears by taking his\r\n    abode in some pure person, well prepared by many lives to be a\r\n    fit abiding place of Love.\r\n\r\n    “Thus Christ made manifest Love’s power to save; but men forgot\r\n    so soon, and so Christ must manifest again, and then again.\r\n\r\n    “And ever since man took his place in form of flesh the Christ\r\n    has been manifest in flesh at first of every age.”\r\n\r\n5 _What relationship existed between Jesus of Nazareth and the\r\nChrist?_ Orthodox Christian ecclesiastics tell us that Jesus of\r\nNazareth and the Christ were one; that the true name of this\r\nremarkable person was Jesus Christ. They tell us that this man of\r\nGalilee was the very eternal God clothed in flesh of man that men\r\nmight see his glory. Of course this doctrine is wholly at variance\r\nwith the teachings of Jesus himself and of his apostles. The Aquarian\r\nMasters in council have formulated an answer to this question that so\r\nwell covers all the information required that we give it in full:\r\n\r\n    “Jesus was an ideal Jew, born in Bethlehem of Judea. His mother\r\n    was a beautiful Jewish girl named Mary. As a child Jesus\r\n    differed but little from other children only that in past lives\r\n    he had overcome carnal propensities to such an extent that he\r\n    could be tempted like others and not yield. Paul was right when\r\n    to the Hebrews he said: ‘He was in all points tempted like as\r\n    we are, yet without sin.’--Hebrews 4:15.\r\n\r\n    “Jesus suffered as other men suffer, and was made perfect\r\n    through suffering; for this is the only way to perfection. His\r\n    life was an example of attainment by the way of crosses and\r\n    cruel treatment. Paul was right again when he said: ‘It became\r\n    him, for whom are all things and by whom are all things, in\r\n    bringing many sons into glory to make the captain of their\r\n    salvation perfect through suffering.’--Hebrews 2:10.\r\n\r\n    “In many respects Jesus was a remarkable child, for by ages\r\n    of strenuous preparation he was qualified to be an avatar, a\r\n    savior of the world, and from childhood he was endowed with\r\n    superior wisdom and was conscious of the fact that he was\r\n    competent to lead the race into the higher ways of spiritual\r\n    living. But he was conscious also of the fact that he must\r\n    attain the mastery by trials, bufferings, temptations and\r\n    sufferings. And all his life was spent in attaining. After his\r\n    death, burial and resurrection he appeared in materialized form\r\n    before the Silent Brothers in the temple of Heliopolis, in\r\n    Egypt, and said:\r\n\r\n    “‘My human life was wholly given to bring my will to tune with\r\n    the deific will; when this was done my earth-tasks all were\r\n    done.\r\n\r\n    “‘You know that all my life was one great drama for the sons\r\n    of men; a pattern for the sons of men. I lived to show the\r\n    possibilities of man.\r\n\r\n    “‘What I have done all men can do, and what I am all men shall\r\n    be.’”--Aquarian Gospel 178:43, 46.\r\n\r\n    “Jesus was the name of the man and it was the only appropriate\r\n    name for this kind of a man. The word means Savior and Jesus\r\n    was in more senses than one a savior.\r\n\r\n    The word Christ means “the anointed one,” and then it is an\r\n    official title. It means, The Master of Love. When we say\r\n    “Jesus the Christ” we refer to the man and to his office;\r\n    just as we do when we say Edward, the King, or Lincoln, the\r\n    President. Edward was not always King, and Lincoln was not\r\n    always President, and Jesus was not always Christ. Jesus won\r\n    his Christship by a strenuous life, and in the Aquarian Gospel,\r\n    chapter 55, we have a record of the events of his christing,\r\n    or receiving the degree Christ. Here is where he was coronated\r\n    by the highest earth authorities as the Christ-King; properly\r\n    speaking, ‘The Master of Love’; and after this was done he\r\n    entered at once upon his Judean and Galilean ministry.\r\n\r\n    “We recognize the facts that Jesus was man and that Christ was\r\n    God, so that in very truth Jesus the Christ was the God-man of\r\n    the ages.”\r\n\r\n    The Nazarene’s Testimony. Jesus himself made the matter clear.\r\n    Once when he was speaking to a congregation in Bethany the\r\n    people called him King and he stood forth and said:\r\n\r\n    “‘I am not sent to sit upon a throne to rule as Caesar rules;\r\n    and you may tell the ruler of the Jews that I am not a claimant\r\n    for his throne.\r\n\r\n    “‘Men call me Christ, and God has recognized the name; but\r\n    Christ is not a man. The Christ is universal Love, and Love is\r\n    King.\r\n\r\n    “‘This Jesus is but man who has been fitted by temptations\r\n    overcome, by trials multiform, to be the temple through which\r\n    the Christ can manifest to men.\r\n\r\n    “‘Then hear, you men of Israel, hear! Look not upon the flesh;\r\n    it is not king. Look to the Christ within who shall be formed\r\n    in every one of you, as he is formed in me.\r\n\r\n    “‘When you have purified your hearts by faith, the king will\r\n    enter in and you will see his face.’”--Aquarian Gospel 68:10-14.\r\n\r\nSurely this question has been answered. Jesus was man; Christ was\r\nDivine Love--the Love of God, and after thirty years of strenuous life\r\nthe man had made his body fit to be the temple of the holy breath and\r\nLove took full possession, and John well said when he declared:\r\n\r\n“‘And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld the\r\nglory of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.’”\r\n\r\n6 _Who was Levi, the Transcriber of this Book?_ Regarding the\r\npersonality of Levi we are permitted to write but little. Suffice it\r\nto say that he is an American citizen, and has been a close student\r\nof the religions of the world from childhood. When but a boy he was\r\nimpressed with the sensitiveness of the finer ethers and believed\r\nthat in some manner they were sensitized plates on which sounds,\r\neven thoughts, were recorded. With avidity he entered into the\r\ndeeper studies of etheric vibration, determined to solve the great\r\nmysteries of the heavens for himself. Forty years he spent in study\r\nand silent meditation, and then he found himself in that stage of\r\nspiritual consciousness that permitted him to enter the domain of\r\nthese superfine ethers and become familiar with their mysteries. He\r\nthen learned that the imaginings of his boyhood days were founded upon\r\nveritable facts, and that every thought of every living thing is there\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\nIn his manuscript entitled “The Cusp of the Ages,” a part of which we\r\nhave already reproduced in this Introduction, we find the following\r\ncopy of the Commission, which Levi received from Visel, the Goddess of\r\nWisdom, or the Holy Breath.\r\n\r\n    LEVI’S COMMISSION.\r\n\r\n    “And then Visel the holy one stood forth and said:\r\n\r\n    “O Levi, son of man, behold, for you are called to be the\r\n    message bearer of the coming age--the age of spirit blessedness.\r\n\r\n    “Give heed, O son of man, for men must know the Christ, the\r\n    Love of God; for Love is sovereign balm for all the wounds of\r\n    men, the remedy for every ill.\r\n\r\n    “And man must be endowed with Wisdom and with Power and with an\r\n    Understanding heart.\r\n\r\n    “Behold the Akasha! Behold the Record Galleries of Visel where\r\n    every thought and word and deed of every living thing is\r\n    written down.\r\n\r\n    “The needs of men are manifold, and men must know their needs.\r\n\r\n    “Now, Levi, hearken to my words: go forth into these mystic\r\n    Galleries and read. There you will find a message for the\r\n    world; for every man; for every living thing.\r\n\r\n    “I breathe upon you now the Holy Breath; you will discriminate,\r\n    and you will know the lessons that these Record Books of God\r\n    are keeping now for men of this new age.\r\n\r\n    “This age will be an age of splendor and of light, because\r\n    it is the home age of the Holy Breath; and Holy Breath will\r\n    testify anew for Christ, the Logos of eternal Love.\r\n\r\n    “At first of every age this Logos is made manifest in flesh so\r\n    man can see and know and comprehend a Love that is not narrow,\r\n    circumscribed.\r\n\r\n    “Twelve times in every revolution of the sun this christed Love\r\n    of God is made full manifest in flesh upon the planes of earth,\r\n    and you may read in Akasha the wondrous lessons that these\r\n    Christs have taught to men; but you shall publish not to men\r\n    the lessons of the Christs of ancient times.\r\n\r\n    “Now, Levi, message bearer of the Spirit Age, take up your pen\r\n    and write.\r\n\r\n    “Write full the story of The Christ who built upon the Solid\r\n    Rock of yonder circle of the sun--the Christ who men have known\r\n    as Enoch the Initiate.\r\n\r\n    “Write of his works as prophet, priest and seer; write of his\r\n    life of purity and love, and how he changed his carnal flesh to\r\n    flesh divine without descending through the gates of death.\r\n\r\n    “And you may write the story of Melchizedec, the Christ who\r\n    lived when Abram lived, and pointed out to men the way to life\r\n    through sacrifice; who gave his life a willing sacrifice for\r\n    men.\r\n\r\n    “And you may write the story of the Prince of Peace, The Christ\r\n    who came as babe in Bethlehem, and traveled every way of life\r\n    that man must tread.\r\n\r\n    “He was despised, rejected and abused; was spit upon, was\r\n    crucified, was buried in a tomb; but he revived and rose a\r\n    conqueror over death that he might show the possibilities of\r\n    man.\r\n\r\n    “A thousand times he said to men; ‘I came to show the\r\n    possibilities of man; what I have done all men may do, and what\r\n    I am all men shall be.’\r\n\r\n    “These stories of The Christ will be enough, for they contain\r\n    the true philosophy of life, of death and of the resurrection\r\n    of the dead.\r\n\r\n    “They show the spiral journey of the soul until the man of\r\n    earth and God are one forevermore.”\r\n\r\n_Levi in Prophecy._ About two thousand years ago Elihu, who conducted\r\na school of the prophets in Zoan, Egypt, referred to Levi thus:\r\n\r\n    “This age will comprehend but little of the works of Purity\r\n    and Love; but not a word is lost, for in the Book of God’s\r\n    Remembrance a registry is made of every thought and word and\r\n    deed;\r\n\r\n    “And when the world is ready to receive, lo, God will send a\r\n    messenger to open up the book and copy from its sacred pages\r\n    all the messages of Purity and Love.\r\n\r\n    “Then every man of earth will read the words of life in the\r\n    language of his native land, and men will see the light.\r\n\r\n    “And man again will be at one with God.”--Aquarian Gospel\r\n    7:25-28.\r\n\r\nFurther references to the personality of Levi are, seemingly,\r\nunnecessary. It matters but little who he is; his work in the\r\ntranscription of the Aquarian Gospel of Jesus, the Christ, stands\r\nunimpeachable. The lessons of this book all bear the stamp of the\r\nNazarene, for no man except the world’s greatest master could have\r\ntouched the high chords of divine Love and Wisdom which characterize\r\nthe pages of this marvelous book.\r\n\r\n7 _What are the Akashic Records?_ Akasha is a Sanskrit word, and\r\nmeans “Primary substance,” that out of which all things are formed.\r\nAccording to Aquarian philosophy, it is the first stage of the\r\ncrystallization of spirit. This philosophy recognizes the fact that\r\nall primordial substance is spirit; that matter is spirit moving at\r\na lower rate of vibration, becoming, as one master expressed it, a\r\ncoagulum.\r\n\r\nThis Akashic, or primary substance, is of exquisite fineness and is so\r\nsensitive that the slightest vibrations of an ether any place in the\r\nuniverse registers an indelible impression upon it.\r\n\r\nThis primal substance is not relegated to any particular part of the\r\nuniverse, but is everywhere present. It is in very fact the “Universal\r\nMind” of which our metaphysicians speak.\r\n\r\nWhen the mind of man is in exact accord with the Universal Mind man\r\nenters into a conscious recognition of these Akashic impressions, and\r\nmay collect them and translate them into any language of earth with\r\nwhich he is familiar.\r\n\r\nIn the infinite One manifest we note the attributes of Force,\r\nIntelligence and Love, and a person may be in full accord with one of\r\nthese attributes and not with the others. One may enter fully into\r\nthe spirit of the God of Force and not be imbued with the spirit of\r\nIntelligence; or one may be wholly absorbed with the spirit of Divine\r\nLove and be far removed from both Intelligence and Force. Furthermore,\r\na person may enter fully into the consciousness of Holy Breath, or\r\nSupreme Intelligence, and be not at all in rapport with either Love or\r\nForce. Knowledge is not gained through the spirit of either Force or\r\nLove. It is only from Universal Mind, which is Supreme Intelligence,\r\ncalled by Oriental scholars the Akashic Records, and by Hebrew\r\nmasters, the Book of God’s Remembrance, that knowledge of any kind can\r\nbe obtained.\r\n\r\n    _Consciousness_; we note three phases of it:\r\n\r\n    1  Consciousness of the omnipotence of God and man.\r\n\r\n    2  Christ consciousness, or consciousness of Divine Love.\r\n\r\n    3  Consciousness of the Holy Breath, or of Supreme Intelligence.\r\n\r\nWe must bear in mind that one of these phases of consciousness does\r\nnot necessarily imply either of the others. People are frequently\r\nfound who are completely filled with the Love of God, are far advanced\r\nin the science of Christ consciousness, who are absolutely ignorant;\r\nhave not the slightest conception of the laws of natural things or of\r\nspiritual things; are not in rapport with the great Teacher which is\r\nthe Holy Spirit.\r\n\r\n_The Akashic Records._ The imperishable records of life, known as the\r\nAkashic Records, are wholly in the domain of Supreme Intelligence, or\r\nUniversal Mind, and the Akashic Record reader must be in such close\r\ntouch with the Holy Spirit, or the Holy Breath, as the ancient masters\r\ncall this spirit of Supreme Intelligence, that every thought vibration\r\nis instantly felt in every fibre of his being.\r\n\r\n_Differentiation._ Since all space is charged with the vibrations of\r\nthoughts of all kinds how may the Akashic Record reader differentiate\r\nand gather only the thoughts and life events of a particular person or\r\ngroup of persons?\r\n\r\nEvery person has his own distinct vibration and when the reader fully\r\nunderstands the law of discrimination his whole being is tuned for the\r\nreception of the one particular tone and rhythm, and it is impossible\r\nfor any other tone or rhythm to make the slightest impression upon\r\nhim. This principle is demonstrated in wireless telegraphy.\r\n\r\nIt required many years for Levi to learn the Law of Differentiation,\r\nand to come in rapport with the tones and rhythms of Jesus of\r\nNazareth, Enoch and Melchizedec and their co-laborers. But under the\r\ndirection of the Spirit of Supreme Intelligence, he has attained unto\r\nthis accomplishment, and now he instantly feels in all his being the\r\nslightest vibrations that come from any of these great centers and, of\r\ncourse, all of his transcriptions are true to the letter.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAN.\r\n\r\n“What is man that thou art mindful of him, or the son of man that thou\r\nvisiteth him?” This was the earnest question of David, the Hebrew\r\nPsalmist, and the 8th Psalm is given wholly to the contemplation of\r\nman, the crowning work of manifest creation. Among the many great\r\nlessons that Levi has been permitted to gather from the Akashic\r\nRecords, or the Universal Mind, we find one on _Man_ in which his\r\ndescent into physical matter and his final ascent into an eternal\r\noneness with God is so graphically described that it certainly merits\r\na place in this Introduction, and we give it in full:\r\n\r\n    “Time never was when man was not.\r\n\r\n    “If life of man at any time began a time would come when it\r\n    would end.\r\n\r\n    “The thoughts of God cannot be circumscribed. No finite mind\r\n    can comprehend things infinite.\r\n\r\n    “All finite things are subject unto change. All finite things\r\n    will cease to be, because there was a time when they were not.\r\n\r\n    “The bodies and the soul of men are finite things, and they\r\n    will change, yea, from the finite point of view the time will\r\n    come when they will be no more.\r\n\r\n    “But man himself is not the body, nor the soul; he is a spirit\r\n    and is part of God.\r\n\r\n    “Creative Fiat gave to man, to spirit man, a soul that he might\r\n    function on the plane of soul; gave him a body of the flesh,\r\n    that he might function on the plane of things made manifest.\r\n\r\n    “Why did creative Fiat give to spirit man a soul that he might\r\n    function on the plane of soul?\r\n\r\n    “Why did creative Fiat give to soul a body of the flesh that it\r\n    might function on the plane of things that are made manifest?\r\n\r\n    “Hear, now, ye worlds, dominions, powers and thrones!\r\n\r\n    “Hear, now, ye cherubim, ye seraphim, ye angels and ye men!\r\n\r\n    “Hear, now, O protoplast, and earth, and plant and beast!\r\n\r\n    “Hear, now, ye creeping things of earth, ye fish that swim, ye\r\n    birds that fly!\r\n\r\n    “Hear, now, ye winds that blow, ye thunders and ye lightnings\r\n    of the sky!\r\n\r\n    “Hear, now, ye spirits of the fire, of water, earth and air!\r\n\r\n    “Hear, now, O everything that is, or was, or evermore will be,\r\n    for Wisdom speaks from out the highest plane of spirit life:\r\n\r\n    “Man is a thought of God; all thoughts of God are infinite;\r\n    they are not measured up by time, for things that are concerned\r\n    with time begin and end.\r\n\r\n    “The thoughts of God are from the everlasting of the past unto\r\n    the never ending days to come--And so is man, the Spirit-man.\r\n\r\n    “But man, like every other thought of God, was but a seed, a\r\n    seed that held within itself the potencies of God, just as\r\n    the seed of any plant of earth holds deep within itself the\r\n    attributes of every part of that especial plant.\r\n\r\n    “So spirit-man, as seed of God, held deep within himself the\r\n    attributes of every part of God.\r\n\r\n    “Now, seeds are perfect, yea, as perfect as the source from\r\n    which they come; but they are not unfolded into life made\r\n    manifest.\r\n\r\n    “The child in utero is perfect as the mother is.\r\n\r\n    “So man, the seed, must be deep planted in a soil that he might\r\n    grow, unfold, as does the bud unfold to show the flower.\r\n\r\n    “The human seed that came forth from the heart of God was full\r\n    ordained to be the lord of plane of soul, and of the plane of\r\n    things made manifest.\r\n\r\n    “So God, the husbandman of every thing that is, threw forth\r\n    this human seed into the soil of soul; it grew apace, and man\r\n    became a living soul; and he became the lord of all the kingdom\r\n    of the soul.\r\n\r\n    “Hark, now, let every creature hear, The plane of soul is but\r\n    the ether of the spirit plane vibrating not so fast, and in the\r\n    slower rhythm of this plane the essences of life are manifest;\r\n    the perfumes and the odors, the true sensations and the all of\r\n    love are manifest.\r\n\r\n    “And these soul attributes become a body beautiful.\r\n\r\n    “A multitude of lessons man must learn upon the plane of soul;\r\n    and here he tarries many ages until his lessons are all learned.\r\n\r\n    “Upon the boundary of the plane of soul the ether began to\r\n    vibrate slower still, and then the essences took on a garb; the\r\n    perfumes and the odors and the true sensations and the all of\r\n    love were clothed in flesh; and man was clothed in flesh.\r\n\r\n    “Perfected man must pass through all the ways of life, and so\r\n    a carnal nature was full manifest, a nature that sprang forth\r\n    from fleshly things.\r\n\r\n    “Without a foe a soldier never knows his strength, and thought\r\n    must be developed by the exercise of strength.\r\n\r\n    “And so this carnal nature soon became a foe that man must\r\n    fight, that he might be the strength of God made manifest.\r\n\r\n    “Let every living thing stand still and hear!\r\n\r\n    “Man is the lord of all the plane of manifests; of protoplast,\r\n    of mineral, of plant, of beast; but he has given up his\r\n    birthright, just to gratify his lower self, his carnal self.\r\n\r\n    “But man will full regain his lost estate, his heritage; but he\r\n    must do it in a conflict that cannot be told in words.\r\n\r\n    “Yea, he must suffer trials and temptations manifold; but let\r\n    him know that cherubim and seraphim that rule the stations\r\n    of the sun, and spirits of the mighty God who rule the solar\r\n    stars are his protectors and his guides, and they will lead to\r\n    victory.\r\n\r\n    “Man will be fully saved, redeemed, perfected by the things he\r\n    suffers on the plane of flesh, and on the plane of soul.\r\n\r\n    “When man has conquered carnal things his garb of flesh will\r\n    then have served its purpose well and it will fall, will be no\r\n    more.\r\n\r\n    “Then he will stand untrammeled on the plane of soul where he\r\n    must full complete his victories.”\r\n\r\n    “Unnumbered foes will stand before the man upon the plane of\r\n    soul; there he must overcome, yea, overcome them every one.\r\n\r\n    “Thus hope will ever be his beacon light; there is no failure\r\n    for the human soul, for God is leading on and victory is sure.\r\n\r\n    “Man cannot die; the spirit man is one with God, and while God\r\n    lives man cannot die.\r\n\r\n    “When man has conquered every foe upon the plane of soul the\r\n    seed will have full opened out, will have unfolded in the Holy\r\n    Breath.\r\n\r\n    “The garb of soul will then have served its purpose well, and\r\n    man will need it never more, and it will pass and be no more.\r\n\r\n    “And man will then attain unto the blessedness of perfectness\r\n    and be at one with God.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT INDEX\r\n\r\nA general outline of the incidents and topics of the book will be\r\nfound in the Contents which

Prophetic messages of Gabriel to\r\n      Zacharias, Elizabeth and Mary. Birth of John. Prophecy of\r\n      Zacharias._\r\n\r\nNear Hebron in the hills of Judah, Zacharias and Elizabeth abode.\r\n\r\n2  They were devout and just, and every day they read the Law, the\r\nProphets and the Psalms which told of one to come, strong to redeem;\r\nand they were waiting for the king.\r\n\r\n3  Now, Zacharias was a priest, and in his turn he led the temple\r\nservice in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n4  It came to pass as Zacharias stood before the Lord and burned the\r\nincense in the Holy Place, that Gabriel came and stood before his face.\r\n\r\n5  And Zacharias was afraid; he thought that some great evil was about\r\nto come upon the Jews.\r\n\r\n6  But Gabriel said, O man of God, fear not; I bring to you, and all\r\nthe world, a message of good will, and peace on earth.\r\n\r\n7  Behold, the Prince of Peace, the king you seek, will quickly come.\r\n\r\n8  Your wife will bear to you a son, a holy son, of whom the prophet\r\nwrote,\r\n\r\n9  Behold, I send Elijah unto you again before the coming of the Lord;\r\nand he will level down the hills and fill the valleys up, and pave the\r\nway for him who shall redeem.\r\n\r\n10  From the beginning of the age your son has borne the name of John,\r\nthe mercy of the Lord; his name is John.\r\n\r\n11  He will be honored in the sight of God, and he will drink no wine,\r\nand from his birth he will be filled with Holy Breath.\r\n\r\n12  And Gabriel stood before Elizabeth as she was in the silence in\r\nher home, and told her all the words that he had said to Zacharias in\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n13  When he had done the service of his course, the priest went home,\r\nand with Elizabeth rejoiced.\r\n\r\n14  Five months passed by and Gabriel came to Mary in her home in\r\nNazareth and said,\r\n\r\n15  Hail Mary, hail! Once blessed in the name of God; twice blessed in\r\nthe name of Holy Breath; thrice blessed in the name of Christ; for you\r\nare worthy, and will bear a son who shall be called Immanuel.\r\n\r\n16  His name is Jesus, for he saves his people from their sins.\r\n\r\n17  When Joseph’s daily task was done he came, and Mary told him all\r\nthe words that Gabriel spoke to her, and they rejoiced; for they\r\nbelieved that he, the man of God, had spoken words of truth.\r\n\r\n18  And Mary went with haste to tell Elizabeth about the promises of\r\nGabriel; together they rejoiced.\r\n\r\n19  And in the home of Zacharias and Elizabeth did Mary tarry ninety\r\ndays; then she returned to Nazareth.\r\n\r\n20  To Zacharias and Elizabeth a son was born, and Zacharias said,\r\n\r\n21  Most blessed be the name of God, for he has opened up the fount of\r\nblessings for his people, Israel.\r\n\r\n22  His promises are verified; for he has brought to pass the words\r\nwhich holy prophets spoke in olden times.\r\n\r\n23  And Zacharias looked upon the infant John, and said,\r\n\r\n24  You will be called the prophet of the Holy One; and you will go\r\nbefore his face, and will prepare his way.\r\n\r\n25  And you will give a knowledge of salvation unto Israel; and you\r\nwill preach the gospel of repentance and the blotting out of sins.\r\n\r\n26  Behold, for soon the Day Star from on high will visit us, to light\r\nthe way for those who sit within the darkness of the shadowland, and\r\nguide our feet unto the ways of peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.\r\n\r\n    _Birth of Jesus. Masters honor the child. The shepherds\r\n      rejoice. Zacharias and Elizabeth visit Mary. Jesus is\r\n      circumcised._\r\n\r\nThe time was nearly due for Jesus to be born, and Mary longed to see\r\nElizabeth, and she and Joseph turned their faces toward the Judean\r\nhills.\r\n\r\n2  And when upon their way they came to Bethlehem the day was done, and\r\nthey must tarry for the night.\r\n\r\n3  But Bethlehem was thronged with people going to Jerusalem; the inns\r\nand homes were filled with guests, and Joseph and his wife could find\r\nno place to rest but in a cave where animals were kept; and there they\r\nslept.\r\n\r\n4  At midnight came a cry, A child is born in yonder cave among the\r\nbeasts. And lo, the promised son of man was born.\r\n\r\n5  And strangers took the little one and wrapped him in the dainty\r\nrobes that Mary had prepared and laid him in a trough from which the\r\nbeasts of burden fed.\r\n\r\n6  Three persons clad in snow-white robes came in and stood before the\r\nchild and said,\r\n\r\n7  All strength, all wisdom and all love be yours, Immanuel.\r\n\r\n8  Now, on the hills of Bethlehem were many flocks of sheep with\r\nshepherds guarding them.\r\n\r\n9  The shepherds were devout, were men of prayer, and they were waiting\r\nfor a strong deliverer to come.\r\n\r\n10  And when the child of promise came a man in snow-white robe\r\nappeared to them, and they fell back in fear. The man stood forth and\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n11  Fear not! behold I bring you joyful news. At midnight in a cave in\r\nBethlehem was born the prophet and the king that you have long been\r\nwaiting for.\r\n\r\n12  And then the shepherds all were glad; they felt that all the hills\r\nwere filled with messengers of light, who said,\r\n\r\n13  All glory be to God on high; peace, peace on earth, good will to\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n14  And then the shepherds came with haste to Bethlehem and to the\r\ncave, that they might see and honor him whom men had called Immanuel.\r\n\r\n15  Now, when the morning came, a shepherdess whose home was near,\r\nprepared a room for Mary, Joseph and the child; and here they tarried\r\nmany days.\r\n\r\n16  And Joseph sent a messenger in haste to Zacharias and Elizabeth to\r\nsay, The child is born in Bethlehem.\r\n\r\n17  And Zacharias and Elizabeth took John and came to Bethlehem with\r\nwords of cheer.\r\n\r\n18  And Mary and Elizabeth recounted all the wondrous things that had\r\ntranspired. The people joined with them in praising God.\r\n\r\n19  According to the custom of the Jews, the child was circumcised; and\r\nwhen they asked, What will you call the child? the mother said, His\r\nname is Jesus, as the man of God declared.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4.\r\n\r\n    _Consecration of Jesus. Mary offers sacrifices. Simeon and Anna\r\n      prophesy. Anna is rebuked for worshipping the child. The\r\n      family returns to Bethlehem._\r\n\r\nNow, Mary took her son, when he was forty days of age, up to the\r\ntemple in Jerusalem, and he was consecrated by the priest.\r\n\r\n2  And then she offered purifying sacrifices for herself, according to\r\nthe custom of the Jews; a lamb and two young turtle doves.\r\n\r\n3  A pious Jew named Simeon was in the temple serving God.\r\n\r\n4  From early youth he had been looking for Immanuel to come, and he\r\nhad prayed to God that he might not depart until his eyes had seen\r\nMessiah in the flesh.\r\n\r\n5  And when he saw the infant Jesus he rejoiced and said, I now am\r\nready to depart in peace, for I have seen the king.\r\n\r\n6  And then he took the infant in his arms and said, Behold, this child\r\nwill bring a sword upon my people, Israel, and all the world; but he\r\nwill break the sword and then the nations will learn war no more.\r\n\r\n7  The master’s cross I see upon the forehead of this child, and he\r\nwill conquer by this sign.\r\n\r\n8  And in the temple was a widow, four and eighty years of age, and she\r\ndeparted not, but night and day she worshipped God.\r\n\r\n9  And when she saw the infant Jesus she exclaimed, Behold Immanuel!\r\nBehold the signet cross of the Messiah on his brow!\r\n\r\n10  And then the woman knelt to worship him, as God with us, Immanuel;\r\nbut one, a master clothed in white, appeared and said,\r\n\r\n11  Good woman, stay; take heed to what you do; you may not worship\r\nman; this is idolatry.\r\n\r\n12  This child is man, the son of man, and worthy of all praise. You\r\nshall adore and worship God; him only shall you serve.\r\n\r\n13  The woman rose and bowed her head in thankfulness and worshipped\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n14  And Mary took the infant Jesus and returned to Bethlehem.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5.\r\n\r\n    _Three magian priests honor Jesus. Herod is alarmed. Calls a\r\n      council of the Jews. Is told that prophets had foretold the\r\n      coming of a king. Herod resolves to kill the child. Mary and\r\n      Joseph take Jesus and flee into Egypt._\r\n\r\nBeyond the river Euphrates the magians lived; and they were wise,\r\ncould read the language of the stars and they divined that one, a\r\nmaster soul, was born; they saw his star above Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n2  And there were three among the magian priests who longed to see the\r\nmaster of the coming age; and they took costly gifts and hastened to\r\nthe West in search of him, the new-born king, that they might honor\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n3  And one took gold, the symbol of nobility; another myrrh, the symbol\r\nof dominion and of power; gum-thus the other took, the symbol of the\r\nwisdom of the sage.\r\n\r\n4  Now when the magians reached Jerusalem the people were amazed, and\r\nwondered who they were and why they came.\r\n\r\n5  And when they asked, Where is the child that has been born a king?\r\nthe very throne of Herod seemed to shake.\r\n\r\n6  And Herod sent a courtier forth to bring the magians to his court.\r\n\r\n7  And when they came they asked again, Where is the new born king? And\r\nthen they said, While yet beyond the Euphrates we saw his star arise,\r\nand we have come to honor him.\r\n\r\n8  And Herod blanched with fear. He thought, perhaps, the priests were\r\nplotting to restore the kingdom of the Jews, and so he said within\r\nhimself, I will know more about this child that has been born a king.\r\n\r\n9  And so he told the magian priests to tarry in the city for a while\r\nand he would tell them all about the king.\r\n\r\n10  He called in council all the Jewish masters of the law and asked,\r\nWhat have the Jewish prophets said concerning such a one?\r\n\r\n11  The Jewish masters answered him and said, The prophets long ago\r\nforetold that one would come to rule the tribes of Israel; that this\r\nMessiah would be born in Bethlehem.\r\n\r\n12  They said, The prophet Micah wrote, O Bethlehem Judea, a little\r\nplace among the Judean hills, yet out of you will one come forth to\r\nrule my people, Israel; yea, one who lived in olden times, in very\r\nancient days.\r\n\r\n13  Then Herod called the magian priests again and told them what the\r\nmasters of the Jewish law had said; and then he sent them on the way\r\nto Bethlehem.\r\n\r\n14  He said, Go search, and if you find the child that has been born a\r\nking, return and tell me all, that I may go and honor him.\r\n\r\n15  The magians went their way and found the child with Mary in the\r\nshepherd’s home.\r\n\r\n16  They honored him; bestowed upon him precious gifts and gave him\r\ngold, gum-thus and myrrh.\r\n\r\n17  These magian priests could read the hearts of men; they read the\r\nwickedness of Herod’s heart, and knew that he had sworn to kill the\r\nnew born king.\r\n\r\n18  And so they told the secret to the parents of the child, and bid\r\nthem flee beyond the reach of harm.\r\n\r\n19  And then the priests went on their homeward way; they went not\r\nthrough Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n20  And Joseph took the infant Jesus and his mother in the night and\r\nfled to Egypt land, and with Elihu and Salome in ancient Zoan they\r\nabode.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6.\r\n\r\n    _Herod learns of the supposed mission of John.

Herod dies._\r\n\r\nNow, when the magian priests did not return to tell him of the child\r\nthat had been born a king, King Herod was enraged.\r\n\r\n2  And then his courtiers told him of another child in Bethlehem, one\r\nborn to go before and to prepare the people to receive the king.\r\n\r\n3  This angered more and more the king; he called his guards and bid\r\nthem go to Bethlehem and slay the infant John, as well as Jesus who\r\nwas born to be a king.\r\n\r\n4  He said, Let no mistake be made, and that you may be sure to slay\r\nthese claimants to my throne, slay all male children in the town not\r\nyet two years of age.\r\n\r\n5  The guards went forth and did as Herod bade them do.\r\n\r\n6  Elizabeth knew not that Herod sought to slay her son, and she and\r\nJohn were yet in Bethlehem; but when she knew, she took the infant\r\nJohn and hastened to the hills.\r\n\r\n7  The murderous guards were near; they pressed upon her hard; but then\r\nshe knew the secret caves in all the hills, and into one she ran and\r\nhid herself and John until the guards were gone.\r\n\r\n8  Their cruel task was done; the guards returned and told the story to\r\nthe king.\r\n\r\n9  They said, We know that we have slain the infant king; but John, his\r\nharbinger, we could not find.\r\n\r\n10  The king was angry with his guards because they failed to slay the\r\ninfant John; he sent them to the tower in chains.\r\n\r\n11  And other guards were sent to Zacharias, father of the harbinger,\r\nwhile he was serving in the Holy Place, to say, The king demands that\r\nyou shall tell where is your son.\r\n\r\n12  But Zacharias did not know, and he replied, I am a minister of God,\r\na servant in the Holy Place; how could I know where they have taken\r\nhim?\r\n\r\n13  And when the guards returned and told the king what Zacharias said,\r\nhe was enraged and said,\r\n\r\n14  My guards, go back and tell that wily priest that he is in my\r\nhands; that if he does not tell the truth, does not reveal the hiding\r\nplace of John, his son, then he shall die.\r\n\r\n15  The guards went back and told the priest just what the king had\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n16  And Zacharias said, I can but give my life for truth; and if the\r\nking does shed my blood the Lord will save my soul.\r\n\r\n17  The guards again returned and told the king what Zacharias said.\r\n\r\n18  Now, Zacharias stood before the altar in the Holy Place engaged in\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\n19  A guard approached and with a dagger thrust him through; he fell\r\nand died before the curtain of the sanctuary of the Lord.\r\n\r\n20  And when the hour of salutation came, for Zacharias daily blessed\r\nthe priests, he did not come.\r\n\r\n21  And after waiting long the priests went to the Holy Place and found\r\nthe body of the dead.\r\n\r\n22  And there was grief, deep grief, in all the land.\r\n\r\n23  Now Herod sat upon his throne; he did not seem to move; his\r\ncourtiers came; the king was dead. His sons reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.\r\n\r\nGIMEL.\r\n\r\n_Education of Mary and Elizabeth in Zoan._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7.\r\n\r\n    _Archelaus reigns. Mary and Elizabeth with their sons are in\r\n      Zoan and are taught by Elihu and Salome. Elihu’s introductory\r\n      lesson. Tells of an interpreter._\r\n\r\nThe son of Herod, Archelaus, reigned in Jerusalem. He was a selfish,\r\ncruel king; he put to death all those who did not honor him.\r\n\r\n2  He called in council all the wisest men and asked about the infant\r\nclaimant to his throne.\r\n\r\n3  The council said that John and Jesus both were dead; then he was\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\n4  Now Joseph, Mary and their son were down in Egypt in Zoan, and John\r\nwas with his mother in the Judean hills.\r\n\r\n5  Elihu and Salome sent messengers in haste to find Elizabeth and\r\nJohn. They found them and they brought them to Zoan.\r\n\r\n6  Now, Mary and Elizabeth were marveling much because of their\r\ndeliverance.\r\n\r\n7  Elihu said, It is not strange; there are no happenings; law governs\r\nall events.\r\n\r\n8  From olden times it was ordained that you should be with us, and in\r\nthis sacred school be taught.\r\n\r\n9  Elihu and Salome took Mary and Elizabeth out to the sacred grove\r\nnear by where they were wont to teach.\r\n\r\n10  Elihu said to Mary and Elizabeth, You may esteem yourselves thrice\r\nblest, for you are chosen mothers of long promised sons,\r\n\r\n11  Who are ordained to lay in solid rock a sure foundation stone on\r\nwhich the temple of the perfect man shall rest--a temple that shall\r\nnever be destroyed.\r\n\r\n12  We measure time by cycle ages, and the gate to every age we deem a\r\nmile stone in the journey of the race.\r\n\r\n13  An age has passed; the gate unto another age flies open at the\r\ntouch of time. This is the preparation age of soul, the kingdom of\r\nImmanuel, of God in man;\r\n\r\n14  And these, your sons, will be the first to tell the news, and\r\npreach the gospel of good will to men, and peace on earth.\r\n\r\n15  A mighty work is theirs; for carnal men want not the light; they\r\nlove the dark, and when the light shines in the dark they comprehend\r\nit not.\r\n\r\n16  We call these sons, Revealers of the Light; but they must have the\r\nlight before they can reveal the light.\r\n\r\n17  And you must teach your sons, and set their souls on fire with love\r\nand holy zeal, and make them conscious of their missions to the sons\r\nof men.\r\n\r\n18  Teach them that God and man were one; but that through carnal\r\nthoughts and words and deeds, man tore himself away from God; debased\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n19  Teach that the Holy Breath would make them one again, restoring\r\nharmony and peace;\r\n\r\n20  That naught can make them one but love; that God so loved the world\r\nthat he has clothed his son in flesh that man may comprehend.\r\n\r\n21  The only Savior of the world is love, and Jesus, son of Mary,\r\ncomes to manifest that love to men.\r\n\r\n22  Now, love cannot be manifest until its way has been prepared, and\r\nnaught can rend the rocks and bring down lofty hills and fill the\r\nvalleys up, and thus prepare the way, but purity.\r\n\r\n23  But purity in life men do not comprehend; and so, it, too, must\r\ncome in flesh.\r\n\r\n24  And you, Elizabeth, are blest because your son is purity made\r\nflesh, and he shall pave the way for love.\r\n\r\n25  This age will comprehend but little of the works of Purity and\r\nLove; but not a word is lost, for in the Book of God’s Remembrance a\r\nregistry is made of every thought, and word, and deed;\r\n\r\n26  And when the world is ready to receive, lo, God will send a\r\nmessenger to open up the book and copy from its sacred pages all the\r\nmessages of Purity and Love.\r\n\r\n27  Then every man of earth will read the words of life in language of\r\nhis native land, and men will see the light, walk in the light and be\r\nthe light.\r\n\r\n28  And man again will be at one with God.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8.\r\n\r\n    _Elihu’s lessons. The unity of life. The two selfs. The devil.\r\n      Love the savior of men. The David of the light. Goliath of\r\n      the dark._\r\n\r\nAgain Elihu met his pupils in the sacred grove and said,\r\n\r\n2  No man lives unto himself; for every living thing is bound by cords\r\nto every other living thing.\r\n\r\n3  Blest are the pure in heart; for they will love and not demand love\r\nin return.\r\n\r\n4  They will not do to other men what they would not have other men do\r\nunto them.\r\n\r\n5  There are two selfs; the higher and the lower self.\r\n\r\n6  The higher self is human spirit clothed with soul, made in the form\r\nof God.\r\n\r\n7  The lower self, the carnal self, the body of desires, is a reflexion\r\nof the higher self, distorted by the murky ethers of the flesh.\r\n\r\n8  The lower self is an illusion, and will pass away; the higher self\r\nis God in man, and will not pass away.\r\n\r\n9  The higher self is the embodiment of truth; the lower self is truth\r\nreversed, and so is falsehood manifest.\r\n\r\n10  The higher self is justice, mercy, love and right; the lower self\r\nis what the higher self is not.\r\n\r\n11  The lower self breeds hatred, slander, lewdness, murders, theft,\r\nand everything that harms; the higher self is mother of the virtues\r\nand the harmonies of life.\r\n\r\n12  The lower self is rich in promises, but poor in blessedness and\r\npeace; it offers pleasure, joy and satisfying gains; but gives unrest\r\nand misery and death.\r\n\r\n13  It gives men apples that are lovely to the eye and pleasant to the\r\nsmell; their cores are full of bitterness and gall.\r\n\r\n14  If you would ask me what to study I would say, yourselfs; and when\r\nyou well had studied them, and then would ask me what to study next, I\r\nwould reply, yourselfs.\r\n\r\n15  He who knows well his lower self, knows the illusions of the world,\r\nknows of the things that pass away; and he who knows his higher self,\r\nknows God; knows well the things that cannot pass away.\r\n\r\n16  Thrice blessed is the man who has made purity and love his very\r\nown; he has been ransomed from the perils of the lower self and is\r\nhimself his higher self.\r\n\r\n17  Men seek salvation from an evil that they deem a living monster of\r\nthe nether world; and they have gods that are but demons in disguise;\r\nall powerful, yet full of jealousy and hate and lust;\r\n\r\n18  Whose favors must be bought with costly sacrifice of fruits, and of\r\nthe lives of birds, and animals, and human kind.\r\n\r\n19  And yet these gods possess no ears to hear, no eyes to see, no\r\nheart to sympathize, no power to save.\r\n\r\n20  This evil is a myth; these gods are made of air, and clothed with\r\nshadows of a thought.\r\n\r\n21  The only devil from which men must be redeemed is self, the lower\r\nself. If man would find his devil he must look within; his name is\r\nself.\r\n\r\n22  If man would find his savior he must look within; and when the\r\ndemon self has been dethroned the savior, Love, will be exalted to the\r\nthrone of power.\r\n\r\n23  The David of the light is Purity, who slays the strong Goliath of\r\nthe dark, and seats the savior, Love, upon the throne.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9.\r\n\r\n    _Salome’s lessons. The man and the woman. Philosophy of human\r\n      moods. The triune God. The Septonate. The God Tao._\r\n\r\nSalome taught the lesson of the day. She said, All times are not\r\nalike. Today the words of man may have the greatest power; tomorrow\r\nwomen teaches best.\r\n\r\n2  In all the ways of life the man and woman should walk hand in hand;\r\nthe one without the other is but half; each has a work to do.\r\n\r\n3  But all things teach; each has a time and season for its own. The\r\nsun, the moon have lessons of their own for men; but each one teaches\r\nat the appointed time.\r\n\r\n4  The lessons of the sun fall down on human hearts like withered\r\nleaves upon a stream, if given in the season of the moon; and so with\r\nlessons of the moon and all the stars.\r\n\r\n5  Today one walks in gloom, downhearted and oppressed; tomorrow that\r\nsame one is filled with joy.\r\n\r\n6  Today the heavens seem full of blessedness and hope; tomorrow hope\r\nhas fled, and every plan and purpose comes to naught.\r\n\r\n7  Today one wants to curse the very ground on which he treads;\r\ntomorrow he is full of love and praise.\r\n\r\n8  Today one hates and scorns and envies and is jealous of the child he\r\nloves; tomorrow he has risen above his carnal self, and breathes forth\r\ngladness and good will.\r\n\r\n9  A thousand times men wonder why these heights and depths, these\r\nlight hearts and these sad, are found in every life.\r\n\r\n10  They do not know that there are teachers everywhere, each busy with\r\na God-appointed task, and driving home to human hearts the truth.\r\n\r\n11  But this is true, and every one receives the lessons that he needs.\r\n\r\n12  And Mary said, Today I am in exaltation great; my thoughts and all\r\nmy life seem lifted up; why am I thus inspired?\r\n\r\n13  Salome replied, This is a day of exaltation; day of worship and of\r\npraise; a day when, in a measure, we may comprehend our Father-God.\r\n\r\n14  Then let us study God, the One, the Three, the Seven.\r\n\r\n15  Before the worlds were formed all things were One; just Spirit,\r\nUniversal Breath.\r\n\r\n16  And Spirit breathed, and that which was not manifest became the\r\nFire and Thought of heaven, the Father-God, the Mother-God.\r\n\r\n17  And when the Fire and Thought of heaven in union breathed, their\r\nson, their only son, was born. This son is Love whom men have called\r\nthe Christ.\r\n\r\n18  Men call the Thought of heaven the Holy Breath.\r\n\r\n19  And when the Triune God breathed forth, lo, seven Spirits stood\r\nbefore the throne. These are the Elohim, creative spirits of the\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\n20  And these are they who said, Let us make man; and in their image\r\nman was made.\r\n\r\n21  In early ages of the world the dwellers in the farther East said,\r\nTao is the name of Universal Breath; and in the ancient books we read,\r\n\r\n22  No manifesting form has Tao Great, and yet he made and keeps the\r\nheavens and earth.\r\n\r\n23  No passion has our Tao Great, and yet he causes sun and moon and\r\nall the stars to rise and set.\r\n\r\n24  No name has Tao Great, and yet he makes all things to grow; he\r\nbrings in season both the seed time and the harvest time.\r\n\r\n25  And Tao Great was One; the One became the Two; the Two became the\r\nThree, the Three evolved the Seven, which filled the universe with\r\nmanifests.\r\n\r\n26  And Tao Great gives unto all, the evil and the good, the rain, the\r\ndew, the sunshine and the flowers; from his rich stores he feeds them\r\nall.\r\n\r\n27  And in the same old book we read of man: He has a spirit knit to\r\nTao Great; a soul which lives within the seven Breaths of Tao Great; a\r\nbody of desires that springs up from the soil of flesh.\r\n\r\n28  Now spirit loves the pure, the good, the true; the body of desires\r\nextols the selfish self; the soul becomes the battle ground between\r\nthe two.\r\n\r\n29  And blessed is the man whose spirit is triumphant and whose lower\r\nself is purified; whose soul is cleansed, becoming fit to be the\r\ncouncil chamber of the manifests of Tao Great.\r\n\r\n30  Thus closed the lesson of Salome.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10.\r\n\r\n    _Elihu’s lessons. The Brahmic religion. Life of Abram. Jewish\r\n      sacred books. The Persian religion._\r\n\r\nElihu taught; he said, In ancient times a people in the East were\r\nworshippers of God, the One, whom they called Brahm.\r\n\r\n2  Their laws were just; they lived in peace; they saw the light\r\nwithin; they walked in wisdom’s ways.\r\n\r\n3  But priests with carnal aims arose, who changed the laws to suit the\r\ncarnal mind; bound heavy burdens on the poor, and scorned the rules of\r\nright; and so the Brahms became corrupt.\r\n\r\n4  But in the darkness of the age a few great masters stood unmoved;\r\nthey loved the name of Brahm; they were great beacon lights before the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n5  And they preserved inviolate the wisdom of their holy Brahm, and\r\nyou may read this wisdom in their sacred books.\r\n\r\n6  And in Chaldea, Brahm was known. A pious Brahm named Terah lived in\r\nUr; his son was so devoted to the Brahmic faith that he was called\r\nA-Brahm; and he was set apart to be the father of the Hebrew race.\r\n\r\n7  Now, Terah took his wife and sons and all his flocks and herds to\r\nHaran in the West; here Terah died.\r\n\r\n8  And Abram took the flocks and herds, and with his kindred journeyed\r\nfurther west;\r\n\r\n9  And when he reached the Oaks of Morah in the land of Canaan, he\r\npitched his tents and there abode.\r\n\r\n10  A famine swept the land and Abram took his kindred and his flocks\r\nand herds and came to Egypt, and in these fertile plains of Zoan\r\npitched his tent, and here abode.\r\n\r\n11  And men still mark the place where Abram lived--across the plain.\r\n\r\n12  You ask why Abram came to Egypt land? This is the cradleland of the\r\ninitiate; all secret things belong to Egypt land; and this is why the\r\nmasters come.\r\n\r\n13  In Zoan Abram taught his science of the stars, and in that sacred\r\ntemple over there he learned the wisdom of the wise.\r\n\r\n14  And when his lessons all were learned, he took his kindred and his\r\nflocks and herds and journeyed back to Canaan, and in the plains of\r\nMamre pitched his tent, and there he lived, and there he died.\r\n\r\n15  And records of his life and works and of his sons, and of the\r\ntribes of Israel, are well preserved in Jewish sacred books.\r\n\r\n16  In Persia Brahm was known, and feared. Men saw him as the One, the\r\ncauseless Cause of all that is, and he was sacred unto them, as Tao to\r\nthe dwellers of the farther East.\r\n\r\n17  The people lived in peace, and justice ruled.\r\n\r\n18  But, as in other lands, in Persia priests arose imbued with self\r\nand self desires, who outraged Force, Intelligence and Love;\r\n\r\n19  Religion grew corrupt, and birds and beasts and creeping things\r\nwere set apart as gods.\r\n\r\n20  In course of time a lofty soul, whom men called Zarathustra, came\r\nin flesh.\r\n\r\n21  He saw the causeless Spirit, high and lifted up; he saw the\r\nweakness of all man appointed gods.\r\n\r\n22  He spoke and all of Persia heard; and when he said, One God, one\r\npeople and one shrine, the altars of the idols fell, and Persia was\r\nredeemed.\r\n\r\n23  But men must see their God with human eyes, and Zarathustra said,\r\n\r\n24  The greatest of the Spirits standing near the throne is the Ahura\r\nMazda, who manifests in brightness of the sun.\r\n\r\n25  And all the people saw Ahura Mazda in the sun, and they fell down\r\nand worshipped him in temples of the sun.\r\n\r\n26  And Persia is the magian land where live the priests who saw the\r\nstar arise to mark the place where Mary’s son was born, and were the\r\nfirst to greet him as the Prince of Peace.\r\n\r\n27  The precepts and the laws of Zarathustra are preserved in the\r\nAvesta which you can read and make your own.\r\n\r\n28  But you must know that words are naught till they are made alive;\r\nuntil the lessons they contain become a part of head and heart.\r\n\r\n29  Now truth is one; but no one knows the truth until he is the truth.\r\nIt is recorded in an ancient book,\r\n\r\n30  Truth is the leavening power of God; it can transmute the all of\r\nlife into itself; and when the all of life is truth, then man is truth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11.\r\n\r\n    _Elihu’s lessons. Buddhism and the precepts of Buddha. The\r\n      mysteries of Egypt._\r\n\r\nAgain Elihu taught; he said, The Indian priests became corrupt; Brahm\r\nwas forgotten in the streets; the rights of men were trampled in the\r\ndust.\r\n\r\n2  And then a mighty master came, a Buddha of enlightenment, who turned\r\naway from wealth and all the honors of the world, and found the\r\nSilence in the quiet groves and caves; and he was blest.\r\n\r\n3  He preached a gospel of a higher life, and taught man how to honor\r\nman.\r\n\r\n4  He had no doctrine of the gods to teach; he just knew man, and so\r\nhis creed was justice, love and righteousness.\r\n\r\n5  I quote for you a few of many of the helpful words which Buddha\r\nspoke:\r\n\r\n6  Hate is a cruel word. If men hate you, regard it not; and you can\r\nturn the hate of men to love and mercy and good will, and mercy is as\r\nlarge as all the heavens.\r\n\r\n7  And there is good enough for all. With good destroy the bad; with\r\ngenerous deeds make avarice ashamed; with truth make straight the\r\ncrooked lines that error draws, for error is but truth distorted, gone\r\nastray.\r\n\r\n8  And pain will follow him who speaks or acts with evil thoughts, as\r\ndoes the wheel the foot of him who draws the cart.\r\n\r\n9  He is a greater man who conquers self than he who kills a thousand\r\nmen in war.\r\n\r\n10  He is the noble man who is himself what he believes that other men\r\nshould be.\r\n\r\n11  Return to him who does you wrong your purest love, and he will\r\ncease from doing wrong; for love will purify the heart of him who is\r\nbeloved as truly as it purifies the heart of him who loves.\r\n\r\n12  The words of Buddha are recorded in the Indian sacred books; attend\r\nto them, for they are part of the instructions of the Holy Breath.\r\n\r\n13  The land of Egypt is the land of secret things.\r\n\r\n14  The mysteries of the ages lie lock-bound in our temples and our\r\nshrines.\r\n\r\n15  The masters of all times and climes come here to learn; and when\r\nyour sons have grown to manhood they will finish all their studies in\r\nEgyptian schools.\r\n\r\n16  But I have said enough. Tomorrow at the rising of the sun we meet\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12.\r\n\r\n    _Salome’s lessons. Prayer. Elihu’s concluding lessons. Sums up\r\n      the three years’ course of study. The pupils return to their\r\n      homes._\r\n\r\nNow, when the morning sun arose the masters and their pupils all were\r\nin the sacred grove.\r\n\r\n2  Salome was the first to speak; she said, Behold the sun! It\r\nmanifests the power of God who speaks to us through sun and moon and\r\nstars;\r\n\r\n3  Through mountain, hill and vale; through flower, and plant and tree.\r\n\r\n4  God sings for us through bird, and harpsichord, and human voice; he\r\nspeaks to us through wind and rain and thunder roll; why should we not\r\nbow down and worship at his feet?\r\n\r\n5  God speaks to hearts apart; and hearts apart must speak to him; and\r\nthis is prayer.\r\n\r\n6  It is not prayer to shout at God, to stand, or sit, or kneel and\r\ntell him all about the sins of men.\r\n\r\n7  It is not prayer to tell the Holy One how great he is, how good he\r\nis, how strong and how compassionate.\r\n\r\n8  God is not man to be bought up by praise of man.\r\n\r\n9  Prayer is the ardent wish that every way of life be light; that\r\nevery act be crowned with good; that every living thing be prospered\r\nby our ministry.\r\n\r\n10  A noble deed, a helpful word is prayer; a fervent, an effectual\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\n11  The fount of prayer is in the heart; by thought, not words, the\r\nheart is carried up to God, where it is blest. Then let us pray.\r\n\r\n12  They prayed, but not a word was said; but in that holy Silence\r\nevery heart was blest.\r\n\r\n13  And then Elihu spoke. He said to Mary and Elizabeth, Our words are\r\nsaid; you need not tarry longer here; the call has come; the way is\r\nclear, you may return unto your native land.\r\n\r\n14  A mighty work is given you to do; you shall direct the minds that\r\nwill direct the world.\r\n\r\n15  Your sons are set apart to lead men up to righteous thoughts, and\r\nwords, and deeds;\r\n\r\n16  To make men know the sinfulness of sin; to lead them from the\r\nadoration of the lower self, and all illusive things, and make them\r\nconscious of the self that lives with Christ in God.\r\n\r\n17  In preparation for their work your sons must walk in many thorny\r\npaths.\r\n\r\n18  Fierce trials and temptations they will meet, like other men; their\r\nloads will not be light, and they will weary be, and faint.\r\n\r\n19  And they will know the pangs of hunger and of thirst; and without\r\ncause they will be mocked, imprisoned, scourged.\r\n\r\n20  To many countries they will go, and at the feet of many masters\r\nthey will sit, for they must learn like other men.\r\n\r\n21  But we have said enough. The blessings of the Three and of the\r\nSeven, who stand before the throne, will surely rest upon you evermore.\r\n\r\n22  Thus closed the lessons of Elihu and Salome. Three years they\r\ntaught their pupils in the sacred grove, and if their lessons all were\r\nwritten in a book, lo, it would be a mighty book; of what they said we\r\nhave the sum.\r\n\r\n23  Now, Mary, Joseph and Elizabeth with Jesus and his harbinger,\r\nset forth upon their homeward way. They went not by Jerusalem, for\r\nArchelaus reigned.\r\n\r\n24  They journeyed by the Bitter Sea, and when they reached Engedi\r\nhills they rested in the home of Joshua, a near of kin; and here\r\nElizabeth and John abode.\r\n\r\n25  But Joseph, Mary and their son went by the Jordan way, and after\r\ncertain days they reached their home in Nazareth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IV.\r\n\r\nDALETH.\r\n\r\n_Childhood and Early Education of John the Harbinger._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13.\r\n\r\n    _Elizabeth in Engedi. Teaches her son. John becomes the pupil\r\n      of Matheno, who reveals to him the meaning of sin and the law\r\n      of forgiveness._\r\n\r\nElizabeth was blest; she spent her time with John, and gave to him the\r\nlessons that Elihu and Salome had given her.\r\n\r\n2  And John delighted in the wildness of his home and in the lessons\r\nthat he learned.\r\n\r\n3  Now in the hills were many caves. The cave of David was a-near in\r\nwhich the Hermit of Engedi lived.\r\n\r\n4  This hermit was Matheno, priest of Egypt, master from the temple of\r\nSakara.\r\n\r\n5  When John was seven years of age Matheno took him to the wilderness\r\nand in the cave of David they abode.\r\n\r\n6  Matheno taught, and John was thrilled with what the master said, and\r\nday by day Matheno opened up to him the mysteries of life.\r\n\r\n7  John loved the wilderness; he loved his master and his simple fare.\r\nTheir food was fruits, and nuts, wild honey and the carob bread.\r\n\r\n8  Matheno was an Israelite, and he attended all the Jewish feasts.\r\n\r\n9  When John was nine years old Matheno took him to a great feast in\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n10  The wicked Archelaus had been deposed and exiled to a distant land\r\nbecause of selfishness and cruelty, and John was not afraid.\r\n\r\n11  John was delighted with his visit to Jerusalem. Matheno told him\r\nall about the service of the Jews; the meaning of their sacrifices and\r\ntheir rites.\r\n\r\n12  John could not understand how sin could be forgiven by killing\r\nanimals and birds and burning them before the Lord.\r\n\r\n13  Matheno said, The God of heaven and earth does not require\r\nsacrifice. This custom with its cruel rites was borrowed from the idol\r\nworshippers of other lands.\r\n\r\n14  No sin was ever blotted out by sacrifice of animal, of bird, or man.\r\n\r\n15  Sin is the rushing forth of man into the fens of wickedness. If one\r\nwould get away from sin he must retrace his steps, and find his way\r\nout of the fens of wickedness.\r\n\r\n16  Return and purify your hearts by love and righteousness and you\r\nshall be forgiven.\r\n\r\n17  This is the burden of the message that the harbinger shall bring to\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n18  What is forgiveness? John inquired.\r\n\r\n19  Matheno said, It is the paying up of debts. A man who wrongs\r\nanother man can never be forgiven until he rights the wrong.\r\n\r\n20  The Vedas says that none can right the wrong but him who does the\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\n21  John said, If this be true where is the power to forgive except the\r\npower that rests in man himself? Can man forgive himself?\r\n\r\n22  Matheno said, The door is wide ajar; you see the way of man’s\r\nreturn to right, and the forgiveness of his sins.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 14.\r\n\r\n    _Matheno’s lessons. The doctrine of universal law. The power\r\n      of man to choose and to attain. The benefits of antagonisms.\r\n      Ancient sacred books. The place of John and Jesus in the\r\n      world’s history._\r\n\r\nMatheno and his pupil, John, were talking of the sacred books of olden\r\ntimes, and of the golden precepts they contained, and John exclaimed,\r\n\r\n2  These golden precepts are sublime; what need have we of other sacred\r\nbooks?\r\n\r\n3  Matheno said, The Spirits of the Holy One cause every thing to come\r\nand go in proper time.\r\n\r\n4  The sun has his own time to set, the moon to rise, to wax and wane,\r\nthe stars to come and go, the rain to fall, the winds to blow;\r\n\r\n5  The seed times and the harvest times to come; man to be born and man\r\nto die.\r\n\r\n6  These mighty Spirits cause the nations to be born; they rock them in\r\ntheir cradles, nurture them to greatest power, and when their tasks\r\nare done they wrap them in their winding sheets and lay them in their\r\ntombs.\r\n\r\n7  Events are many in a nation’s life, and in the life of man, that are\r\nnot pleasant for the time; but in the end the truth appears: whatever\r\ncomes is for the best.\r\n\r\n8  Man was created for a noble part; but he could not be made a free\r\nman filled with wisdom, truth and might.\r\n\r\n9  If he were hedged about, confined in straits from which he could not\r\npass, then he would be a toy, a mere machine.\r\n\r\n10  Creative spirits gave to man a will; and so he has the power to\r\nchoose.\r\n\r\n11  He may attain the greatest heights, or sink to deepest depths; for\r\nwhat he wills to gain he has the power to gain.\r\n\r\n12  If he desires strength he has the power to gain that strength; but\r\nhe must overcome resistances to reach the goal; no strength is ever\r\ngained in idleness.\r\n\r\n13  So, in the whirl of many-sided conflicts man is placed where he\r\nmust strive to extricate himself.\r\n\r\n14  In every conflict man gains strength; with every conquest he\r\nattains to greater heights. With every day he finds new duties and new\r\ncares.\r\n\r\n15  Man is not carried over dangerous pits, nor helped to overcome his\r\nfoes. He is himself his army, and his sword and shield; and he is\r\ncaptain of his hosts.\r\n\r\n16  The Holy Ones just light his way. Man never has been left without a\r\nbeacon light to guide.\r\n\r\n17  And he has ever had a lighted lamp in hand that he may see the\r\ndangerous rocks, the turbid streams and treacherous pits.\r\n\r\n18  And so the Holy Ones have judged; when men have needed added light\r\na master soul has come to earth to give that light.\r\n\r\n19  Before the Vedic days the world had many sacred books to light the\r\nway; and when man needed greater light the Vedas, the Avesta and the\r\nbooks of Tao Great appeared to show the way to greater heights.\r\n\r\n20  And in the proper place the Hebrew Bible, with its Law, its\r\nProphets and its Psalms, appeared for man’s enlightenment.\r\n\r\n21  But years have passed and men have need of greater light.\r\n\r\n22  And now the Day Star from on high begins to shine; and Jesus is the\r\nflesh-made messenger to show that light to men.\r\n\r\n23  And you, my pupil, you have been ordained to harbinger the coming\r\nday.\r\n\r\n24  But you must keep that purity of heart you now possess; and you\r\nmust light your lamp directly from the coals that burn upon the altar\r\nof the Holy Ones.\r\n\r\n25  And then your lamp will be transmuted to a boundless flame, and you\r\nwill be a living torch whose light will shine wherever man abides.\r\n\r\n26  But in the ages yet to come, man will attain to greater heights,\r\nand lights still more intense will come.\r\n\r\n27  And then, at last, a mighty master soul will come to earth to light\r\nthe way up to the throne of perfect man.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 15.\r\n\r\n    _Death and burial of Elizabeth. Matheno’s lessons. The ministry\r\n      of death. The mission of John. Institution of the rite of\r\n      baptism. Matheno takes John to Egypt, and places him in the\r\n      temple at Sakara, where he remains eighteen years._\r\n\r\nWhen John was twelve years old his mother died, and neighbors laid her\r\nbody in a tomb among her kindred in the Hebron burying ground, and\r\nnear to Zacharias’ tomb.\r\n\r\n2  And John was deeply grieved; he wept. Matheno said, It is not well\r\nto weep because of death.\r\n\r\n3  Death is no enemy of man; it is a friend who, when the work of life\r\nis done, just cuts the cord that binds the human boat to earth, that\r\nit may sail on smoother seas.\r\n\r\n4  No language can describe a mother’s worth, and yours was tried and\r\ntrue. But she was not called hence until her tasks were done.\r\n\r\n5  The calls of death are always for the best, for we are solving\r\nproblems there as well as here; and one is sure to find himself where\r\nhe can solve his problems best.\r\n\r\n6  It is but selfishness that makes one wish to call again to earth\r\ndeparted souls.\r\n\r\n7  Then let your mother rest in peace. Just let her noble life be\r\nstrength and inspiration unto you.\r\n\r\n8  A crisis in your life has come, and you must have a clear conception\r\nof the work that you are called to do.\r\n\r\n9  The sages of the ages call you harbinger. The prophets look to you\r\nand say, He is Elijah come again.\r\n\r\n10  Your mission here is that of harbinger; for you will go before\r\nMessiah’s face to pave his way, and make the people ready to receive\r\ntheir king.\r\n\r\n11  This readiness is purity of heart; none but the pure in heart can\r\nrecognize the king.\r\n\r\n12  To teach men to be pure in heart you must yourself be pure in\r\nheart, and word, and deed.\r\n\r\n13  In infancy the vow for you was made and you became a Nazarite. The\r\nrazor shall not touch your face nor head, and you shall taste not wine\r\nnor fiery drinks.\r\n\r\n14  Men need a pattern for their lives; they love to follow, not to\r\nlead.\r\n\r\n15  The man who stands upon the corners of the paths and points the\r\nway, but does not go, is just a pointer; and a block of wood can do\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\n16  The teacher treads the way; on every span of ground he leaves his\r\nfootprints clearly cut, which all can see and be assured that he,\r\ntheir master, went that way.\r\n\r\n17  Men comprehend the inner life by what they see and do. They come to\r\nGod through ceremonies and forms.\r\n\r\n18  And so when you would make men know that sins are washed away by\r\npurity in life, a rite symbolic may be introduced.\r\n\r\n19  In water wash the bodies of the people who would turn away from sin\r\nand strive for purity in life.\r\n\r\n20  This rite of cleansing is a preparation rite and they who thus are\r\ncleansed comprise the Church of Purity.\r\n\r\n21  And you shall say, You men of Israel, hear; Reform and wash; become\r\nthe sons of purity, and you shall be forgiven.\r\n\r\n22  This rite of cleansing and this church are but symbolic of the\r\ncleansing of the soul by purity in life, and of the kingdom of the\r\nsoul, which does not come with outward show, but is the church within.\r\n\r\n23  Now, you may never point the way and tell the multitudes to do what\r\nyou have never done; but you must go before and show the way.\r\n\r\n24  You are to teach that men must wash; so you must lead the way, your\r\nbody must be washed, symbolic of the cleansing of the soul.\r\n\r\n25  John said, Why need I wait? May I not go at once and wash?\r\n\r\n26  Matheno said, ’Tis well, and then they went down to the Jordan\r\nford, and east of Jericho, just where the hosts of Israel crossed when\r\nfirst they entered Canaan, they tarried for a time.\r\n\r\n27  Matheno taught the harbinger, and he explained to him the inner\r\nmeaning of the cleansing rite and how to wash himself and how to wash\r\nthe multitude.\r\n\r\n28  And in the river Jordan John was washed; then they returned unto\r\nthe wilderness.\r\n\r\n29  Now in Engedi’s hills Matheno’s work was done and he and John went\r\ndown to Egypt. They rested not until they reached the temple of Sakara\r\nin the valley of the Nile.\r\n\r\n30  For many years Matheno was a master in this temple of the\r\nBrotherhood, and when he told about the life of John and of his\r\nmission to the sons of men, the hierophant with joy received the\r\nharbinger and he was called the Brother Nazarite.\r\n\r\n31  For eighteen years John lived and wrought within these temple\r\ngates; and here he conquered self, became a master mind and learned\r\nthe duties of the harbinger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION V.\r\n\r\nHE.\r\n\r\n_Childhood and Early Education of Jesus._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 16.\r\n\r\n    _The home of Joseph. Mary teaches her son. Jesus’ grandparents\r\n      give a feast in his honor. Jesus has a dream. His\r\n      grandmother’s interpretation. His birthday gift._\r\n\r\nThe home of Joseph was on Marmion Way in Nazareth; here Mary taught\r\nher son the lessons of Elihu and Salome.\r\n\r\n2  And Jesus greatly loved the Vedic hymns and the Avesta; but more\r\nthan all he loved to read the Psalms of David and the pungent words of\r\nSolomon.\r\n\r\n3  The Jewish books of prophecy were his delight; and when he reached\r\nhis seventh year he needed not the books to read, for he had fixed in\r\nmemory every word.\r\n\r\n4  Joachim and his wife, grandparents of child Jesus, made a feast in\r\nhonor of the child, and all their near of kin were guests.\r\n\r\n5  And Jesus stood before the guests and said, I had a dream, and in my\r\ndream I stood before a sea, upon a sandy beach.\r\n\r\n6  The waves upon the sea were high; a storm was raging on the deep.\r\n\r\n7  Some one above gave me a wand. I took the wand and touched the sand,\r\nand every grain of sand became a living thing; the beach was all a\r\nmass of beauty and of song.\r\n\r\n8  I touched the waters at my feet, and they were changed to trees, and\r\nflowers, and singing birds, and every thing was praising God.\r\n\r\n9  And some one spoke, I did not see the one who spoke, I heard the\r\nvoice, which said, There is no death.\r\n\r\n10  Grandmother Anna loved the child; she laid her hand on Jesus’ head\r\nand said, I saw you stand beside the sea; I saw you touch the sand and\r\nwaves; I saw them turn to living things and then I knew the meaning of\r\nthe dream.\r\n\r\n11  The sea of life rolls high; the storms are great. The multitude of\r\nmen are idle, listless, waiting, like dead sand upon the beach.\r\n\r\n12  Your wand is truth. With this you touch the multitudes, and every\r\nman becomes a messenger of holy light and life.\r\n\r\n13  You touch the waves upon the sea of life; their turmoils cease; the\r\nvery winds become a song of praise.\r\n\r\n14  There is no death, because the wand of truth can change the dryest\r\nbones to living things, and bring the lovliest flowers from stagnant\r\nponds, and turn the most discordant notes to harmony and praise.\r\n\r\n15  Joachim said, My son, today you pass the seventh milestone of your\r\nway of life, for you are seven years of age, and we will give to you,\r\nas a remembrance of this day, whatever you desire; choose that which\r\nwill afford you most delight.\r\n\r\n16  And Jesus said, I do not want a gift, for I am satisfied. If I\r\ncould make a multitude of children glad upon this day I would be\r\ngreatly pleased.\r\n\r\n17  Now, there are many hungry boys and girls in Nazareth who would be\r\npleased to eat with us this feast and share with us the pleasures of\r\nthis day.\r\n\r\n18  The richest gift that you can give to me is your permission to go\r\nout and find these needy ones and bring them here that they may feast\r\nwith us.\r\n\r\n19  Joachim said, ’Tis well; go out and find the needy boys and girls\r\nand bring them here; we will prepare enough for all.\r\n\r\n20  And Jesus did not wait; he ran; he entered every dingy hut and\r\ncabin of the town; he did not waste his words; he told his mission\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\n21  And in a little time one hundred and three-score of happy, ragged\r\nboys and girls were following him up Marmion Way.\r\n\r\n22  The guests made way; the banquet hall was filled with Jesus’\r\nguests, and Jesus and his mother helped to serve.\r\n\r\n23  And there was food enough for all, and all were glad; and so the\r\nbirthday gift of Jesus was a crown of righteousness.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 17.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus talks with the rabbi of the synagogue of Nazareth. He\r\n      criticises the narrowness of Jewish thought._\r\n\r\nNow, Rabbi Barachia of the synagogue of Nazareth, was aid to Mary in\r\nthe teaching of her son.\r\n\r\n2  One morning after service in the synagogue the rabbi said to Jesus\r\nas he sat in silent thought, Which is the greatest of the Ten Commands?\r\n\r\n3  And Jesus said, I do not see a greatest of the Ten Commands. I see\r\na golden cord that runs through all the Ten Commands that binds them\r\nfast and makes them one.\r\n\r\n4  This cord is love, and it belongs to every word of all the Ten\r\nCommands.\r\n\r\n5  If one is full of love he can do nothing else than worship God; for\r\nGod is love.\r\n\r\n6  If one is full of love, he cannot kill; he cannot falsely testify;\r\nhe cannot covet; can do naught but honor God and man.\r\n\r\n7  If one is full of love he does not need commands of any kind.\r\n\r\n8  And Rabbi Barachia said, Your words are seasoned with the salt of\r\nwisdom that is from above. Who is the teacher who has opened up this\r\ntruth to you?\r\n\r\n9  And Jesus said, I do not know that any teacher opens up this truth\r\nfor me. It seems to me that truth was never shut; that it was always\r\nopened up, for truth is one and it is everywhere.\r\n\r\n10  And if we open up the windows of our minds the truth will enter\r\nin and make herself at home; for truth can find her way through any\r\ncrevice, any window, any open door.\r\n\r\n11  The rabbi said, What hand is strong enough to open up the windows\r\nand the doors of mind so truth can enter in?\r\n\r\n12  And Jesus said, It seems to me that love, the golden cord that\r\nbinds the Ten Commands in one, is strong enough to open any human door\r\nso that the truth can enter in and cause the heart to understand.\r\n\r\n13  Now, in the evening Jesus and his mother sat alone, and Jesus said,\r\n\r\n14  The rabbi seems to think that God is partial in his treatment of\r\nthe sons of men; that Jews are favored and are blest above all other\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n15  I do not see how God can have his favorites and be just.\r\n\r\n16  Are not Samaritans and Greeks and Romans just as much the children\r\nof the Holy One as are the Jews?\r\n\r\n17  I think the Jews have built a wall about themselves, and they see\r\nnothing on the other side of it.\r\n\r\n18  They do not know that flowers are blooming over there; that sowing\r\ntimes and reaping times belong to anybody but the Jews.\r\n\r\n19  It surely would be well if we could break these barriers down so\r\nthat the Jews might see that God has other children that are just as\r\ngreatly blest.\r\n\r\n20  I want to go from Jewry land and meet my kin in other countries of\r\nmy Fatherland.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 18.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus at a feast in Jerusalem. Is grieved by the cruelties of\r\n      the sacrificers. Appeals to Hillel, who sympathizes with him.\r\n      He remains in the temple a year._\r\n\r\nThe great feast of the Jews was on, and Joseph, Mary and their son,\r\nand many of their kin, went to Jerusalem. The child was ten years old.\r\n\r\n2  And Jesus watched the butchers kill the lambs and birds and burn\r\nthem on the altar in the name of God.\r\n\r\n3  His tender heart was shocked at this display of cruelty; he asked\r\nthe serving priest, What is the purpose of this slaughter of the\r\nbeasts and birds? Why do you burn their flesh before the Lord?\r\n\r\n4  The priest replied, This is our sacrifice for sin. God has commanded\r\nus to do these things, and said that in these sacrifices all our sins\r\nare blotted out.\r\n\r\n5  And Jesus said, Will you be kind enough to tell when God proclaimed\r\nthat sins are blotted out by sacrifice of any kind?\r\n\r\n6  Did not David say that God requires not a sacrifice for sin? that it\r\nis sin itself to bring before his face burnt offerings, as offerings\r\nfor sin? Did not Isaiah say the same?\r\n\r\n7  The priest replied, My child, you are beside yourself. Do you know\r\nmore about the laws of God than all the priests of Israel? This is no\r\nplace for boys to show their wit.\r\n\r\n8  But Jesus heeded not his taunts; he went to Hillel, chief of the\r\nSanhedrim, and he said to him,\r\n\r\n9  Rabboni, I would like to talk with you; I am disturbed about this\r\nservice of the pascal feast. I thought the temple was the house of God\r\nwhere love and kindness dwell.\r\n\r\n10  Do you not hear the bleating of those lambs, the pleading of those\r\ndoves that men are killing over there? Do you not smell that awful\r\nstench that comes from burning flesh?\r\n\r\n11  Can man be kind and just, and still be filled with cruelty?\r\n\r\n12  A God that takes delight in sacrifice, in blood and burning flesh,\r\nis not my Father-God.\r\n\r\n13  I want to find a God of love, and you, my master, you are wise, and\r\nsurely you can tell me where to find the God of love.\r\n\r\n14  But Hillel could not give an answer to the child. His heart was\r\nstirred with sympathy. He called the child to him; he laid his hand\r\nupon his head and wept.\r\n\r\n15  He said, There is a God of love, and you shall come with me; and\r\nhand in hand we will go forth and find the God of love.\r\n\r\n16  And Jesus said, Why need we go? I thought that God is everywhere.\r\nCan we not purify our hearts and drive out cruelty, and every wicked\r\nthought, and make within, a temple where the God of love can dwell?\r\n\r\n17  The master of the great Sanhedrim felt as though he was himself the\r\nchild, and that before him stood Rabboni, master of the higher law.\r\n\r\n18  He said within himself, This child is surely prophet sent from God.\r\n\r\n19  Then Hillel sought the parents of the child, and asked that Jesus\r\nmight abide with him, and learn the precepts of the law, and all the\r\nlessons of the temple priests.\r\n\r\n20  His parents gave consent, and Jesus did abide within the holy\r\ntemple in Jerusalem, and Hillel taught him every day.\r\n\r\n21  And every day the master learned from Jesus many lessons of the\r\nhigher life.\r\n\r\n22  The child remained with Hillel in the temple for a year, and then\r\nreturned unto his home in Nazareth; and there he wrought with Joseph\r\nas a carpenter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 19.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus at the age of twelve in the temple. Disputes with the\r\n      doctors of the law. Reads from a book of prophecy. By request\r\n      of Hillel he interprets the prophecies._\r\n\r\nAgain the great feast in Jerusalem was on, and Joseph, Mary and their\r\nson were there. The child was twelve years old.\r\n\r\n2  And there were Jews and proselytes from many countries in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n3  And Jesus sat among the priests and doctors in the temple hall.\r\n\r\n4  And Jesus opened up a book of prophecy and read:\r\n\r\n5  Woe, woe, to Ariel, the town where David dwelt! I will dismantle\r\nAriel, and she shall groan and weep:\r\n\r\n6  And I will camp against her round about with hostile posts;\r\n\r\n7  And I will bring her low and she shall speak out of the earth; with\r\nmuffled voice like a familiar spirit shall she speak; yea, she shall\r\nonly whisper forth her speech;\r\n\r\n8  And foes unnumbered, like the grains of dust, shall come upon her\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\n9  The Lord of hosts will visit her with thunder and with tempest, and\r\nwith storm; with earthquake, and with devouring flames.\r\n\r\n10  Lo, all these people have deserted me. They draw to me with speech,\r\nand with their lips they honor me; their hearts are far removed from\r\nme; their fear for me is that inspired by man.\r\n\r\n11  And I will breathe an adverse breath upon my people, Israel; the\r\nwisdom of their wise men shall be lost; the understanding of their\r\nprudent men shall not be found.\r\n\r\n12  My people seek to hide their counsel from the Lord, so that their\r\nworks may not be seen. They fain would cover up their works with\r\ndarkness of the night, and say, Who sees us now? Who knows us now?\r\n\r\n13  Poor, foolish men! shall that which has been made say of its maker,\r\nHe is naught, I made myself?\r\n\r\n14  Or shall the pot speak out and say to him, who made the pot, You\r\nhave no skill; you do not know?\r\n\r\n15  But this will not forever be; the time will come when Lebanon will\r\nbe a fruitful field, and fruitful fields will be transformed to groves.\r\n\r\n16  And on that day the deaf will hear the words of God; the blind will\r\nread the Book of God’s Remembrance.\r\n\r\n17  And suffering ones will be relieved, and they will have abundant\r\njoy; and every one that needs will be supplied; and it will come to\r\npass that all the foolish will be wise.\r\n\r\n18  The people will return and sanctify the Holy One, and in their\r\nheart of hearts, lo, they will reverence him.\r\n\r\n19  When Jesus had thus read he put aside the book and said, You\r\nmasters of the law, will you make plain for us the prophet’s words?\r\n\r\n20  Now, Hillel sat among the masters of the law, and he stood forth\r\nand said, Perhaps our young rabboni who has read the word will be\r\ninterpreter.\r\n\r\n21  And Jesus said, The Ariel of the prophet is our own Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n22  By selfishness and cruelty this people has become a stench unto the\r\nElohim.\r\n\r\n23  The prophet saw these days from far, and of these times he wrote.\r\n\r\n24  Our doctors, lawyers, priests and scribes oppress the poor, while\r\nthey themselves in luxury live.\r\n\r\n25  The sacrifices and the offerings of Israel are but abomination unto\r\nGod. The only sacrifice that God requires is self.\r\n\r\n26  Because of this injustice and this cruelty of man to man, the Holy\r\nOne has spoken of this commonwealth:\r\n\r\n27  Lo, I will overturn, yes, I will overturn, it shall be overturned,\r\nand it shall be no more until he comes whose right it is and I will\r\ngive it unto him.\r\n\r\n28  In all the world there is one law of right, and he who breaks that\r\nlaw will suffer grief; for God is just.\r\n\r\n29  And Israel has gone far astray; has not regarded justice, nor the\r\nrights of man, and God demands that Israel shall reform, and turn\r\nagain to ways of holiness.\r\n\r\n30  And if our people will not hear the voice of God, lo, nations from\r\nafar will come and sack Jerusalem, and tear our temple down, and take\r\nour people captive into foreign lands.\r\n\r\n31  But this will not forever be; though they be scattered far and\r\nwide, and wander here and there among the nations of the earth, like\r\nsheep that have no shepherd guide,\r\n\r\n32  The time will come when God will bring again the captive hosts; for\r\nIsrael shall return and dwell in peace.\r\n\r\n33  And after many years our temple shall be built again, and one whom\r\nGod will honor, one in whom the pure in heart delights will come and\r\nglorify the house of God, and reign in righteousness.\r\n\r\n34  When Jesus had thus said, he stepped aside, and all the people were\r\namazed and said, This surely is the Christ.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 20.\r\n\r\n    _After the feast.

Symbolic meaning of carpenter’s tools._\r\n\r\nThe great feast of the pasch was ended and the Nazarenes were\r\njourneying toward their homes.\r\n\r\n2  And they were in Samaria, and Mary said, Where is my son? No one had\r\nseen the boy.\r\n\r\n3  And Joseph sought among their kindred who were on their way to\r\nGalilee; but they had seen him not.\r\n\r\n4  Then Joseph, Mary, and a son of Zebedee, returned and sought through\r\nall Jerusalem, but they could find him not.\r\n\r\n5  And then they went up to the temple courts and asked the guards,\r\nHave you seen Jesus, a fair-haired boy, with deep blue eyes, twelve\r\nyears of age, about these courts?\r\n\r\n6  The guards replied, Yes, he is in the temple now disputing with the\r\ndoctors of the law.\r\n\r\n7  And they went in, and found him as the guards had said.\r\n\r\n8  And Mary said, Why Jesus, why do you treat your parents thus? Lo,\r\nwe have sought two days for you. We feared that some great harm had\r\novertaken you.\r\n\r\n9  And Jesus said, Do you not know that I must be about my Father’s\r\nwork?\r\n\r\n10  But he went round and pressed the hand of every doctor of the law\r\nand said, I trust that we may meet again.\r\n\r\n11  And then he went forth with his parents on their way to Nazareth;\r\nand when they reached their home he wrought with Joseph as a carpenter.\r\n\r\n12  One day as he was bringing forth the tools for work he said,\r\n\r\n13  These tools remind me of the ones we handle in the workshop of the\r\nmind where things are made of thought and where we build up character.\r\n\r\n14  We use the square to measure all our lines, to straighten out the\r\ncrooked places of the way, and make the corners of our conduct square.\r\n\r\n15  We use the compass to draw circles round our passions and desires\r\nto keep them in the bounds of righteousness.\r\n\r\n16  We use the ax to cut away the knotty, useless and ungainly parts\r\nand make the character symmetrical.\r\n\r\n17  We use the hammer to drive home the truth, and pound it in until it\r\nis a part of every part.\r\n\r\n18  We use the plane to smooth the rough, uneven surfaces of joint, and\r\nblock, and board that go to build the temple for the truth.\r\n\r\n19  The chisel, line, the plummet and the saw all have their uses in\r\nthe workshop of the mind.\r\n\r\n20  And then this ladder with its trinity of steps, faith, hope and\r\nlove; on it we climb up to the dome of purity in life.\r\n\r\n21  And on the twelve-step ladder we ascend until we reach the pinnacle\r\nof that which life is spent to build--the Temple of Perfected Man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VI.\r\n\r\nVAU.\r\n\r\n_Life and Works of Jesus in India._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 21.\r\n\r\n    _Ravanna sees Jesus in the temple and is captivated. Hillel\r\n      tells him about the boy. Ravanna finds Jesus in Nazareth and\r\n      gives a feast in his honor. Ravanna becomes patron of Jesus,\r\n      and takes him to India to study the Brahmic religion._\r\n\r\nA royal prince of India, Ravanna of Orissa in the south, was at the\r\nJewish feast.\r\n\r\n2  Ravanna was a man of wealth; and he was just, and with a band of\r\nBrahmic priests sought wisdom in the West.\r\n\r\n3  When Jesus stood among the Jewish priests and read and spoke,\r\nRavanna heard and was amazed.\r\n\r\n4  And when he asked who Jesus was, from whence he came and what he\r\nwas, chief Hillel said,\r\n\r\n5  We call this child the Day Star from on high, for he has come to\r\nbring to men a light, the light of life; to lighten up the way of men\r\nand to redeem his people, Israel.\r\n\r\n6  And Hillel told Ravanna all about the child; about the prophecies\r\nconcerning him; about the wonders of the night when he was born; about\r\nthe visit of the magian priests;\r\n\r\n7  About the way in which he was protected from the wrath of evil men;\r\nabout his flight to Egypt-land, and how he then was serving with his\r\nfather as a carpenter in Nazareth.\r\n\r\n8  Ravanna was entranced, and asked to know the way to Nazareth, that\r\nhe might go and honor such a one as son of God.\r\n\r\n9  And with his gorgeous train he journeyed on the way and came to\r\nNazareth of Galilee.\r\n\r\n10  He found the object of his search engaged in building dwellings for\r\nthe sons of men.\r\n\r\n11  And when he first saw Jesus he was climbing up a twelve-step\r\nladder, and he carried in his hands a compass, square and ax.\r\n\r\n12  Ravanna said, All hail, most favored son of heaven!\r\n\r\n13  And at the inn Ravanna made a feast for all the people of the town;\r\nand Jesus and his parents were the honored guests.\r\n\r\n14  For certain days Ravanna was a guest in Joseph’s home on Marmion\r\nWay; he sought to learn the secret of the wisdom of the son; but it\r\nwas all too great for him.\r\n\r\n15  And then he asked that he might be the patron of the child; might\r\ntake him to the East where he could learn the wisdom of the Brahms.\r\n\r\n16  And Jesus longed to go that he might learn: and after many days his\r\nparents gave consent.\r\n\r\n17  Then, with proud heart, Ravanna with his train, began the journey\r\ntoward the rising sun; and after many days they crossed the Sind, and\r\nreached the province of Orissa, and the palace of the prince.\r\n\r\n18  The Brahmic priests were glad to welcome home the prince; with\r\nfavor they received the Jewish boy.\r\n\r\n19  And Jesus was accepted as a pupil in the temple Jagannath; and here\r\nhe learned the Vedas and the Manic laws.\r\n\r\n20  The Brahmic masters wondered at the clear conceptions of the child,\r\nand often were amazed when he explained to them the meaning of the\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 22.\r\n\r\n    _The friendship of Jesus and Lamaas. Jesus explains to Lamaas\r\n      the meaning of truth, man, power, understanding, wisdom,\r\n      salvation and faith._\r\n\r\nAmong the priests of Jagannath was one who loved the Jewish boy.\r\nLamaas Bramas was the name by which the priest was known.\r\n\r\n2  One day as Jesus and Lamaas walked alone in plaza Jagannath, Lamaas\r\nsaid, My Jewish master, what is truth?\r\n\r\n3  And Jesus said, Truth is the only thing that changes not.\r\n\r\n4  In all the world there are two things; the one is truth; the other\r\nfalsehood is; and truth is that which is, and falsehood that which\r\nseems to be.\r\n\r\n5  Now truth is aught, and has no cause, and yet it is the cause of\r\neverything.\r\n\r\n6  Falsehood is naught, and yet it is the manifest of aught.\r\n\r\n7  Whatever has been made will be unmade; that which begins must end.\r\n\r\n8  All things that can be seen by human eyes are manifests of aught,\r\nare naught, and so must pass away.\r\n\r\n9  The things we see are but reflexes just appearing, while the ethers\r\nvibrate so and so, and when conditions change they disappear.\r\n\r\n10  The Holy Breath is truth; is that which was, and is, and evermore\r\nshall be; it cannot change nor pass away.\r\n\r\n11  Lamaas said, You answer well; now, what is man?\r\n\r\n12  And Jesus said, Man is the truth and falsehood strangely mixed.\r\n\r\n13  Man is the Breath made flesh; so truth and falsehood are conjoined\r\nin him; and then they strive, and naught goes down and man as truth\r\nabides.\r\n\r\n14  Again Lamaas asked, What do you say of power?\r\n\r\n15  And Jesus said, It is a manifest; is the result of force; it is but\r\nnaught; it is illusion, nothing more. Force changes not, but power\r\nchanges as the ethers change.\r\n\r\n16  Force is the will of God and is omnipotent, and power is that will\r\nin manifest, directed by the Breath.\r\n\r\n17  There is a power in the winds, a power in the waves, a power in the\r\nlightning’s stroke, a power in the human arm, a power in the eye.\r\n\r\n18  The ethers cause these powers to be, and thought of Elohim, of\r\nangel, man, or other thinking thing, directs the force; when it has\r\ndone its work the power is no more.\r\n\r\n19  Again Lamaas asked, Of understanding what have you to say?\r\n\r\n20  And Jesus said, It is the rock on which man builds himself; it is\r\nthe gnosis of the aught and of the naught, of falsehood and of truth.\r\n\r\n21  It is the knowledge of the lower self; the sensing of the powers of\r\nman himself.\r\n\r\n22  Again Lamaas asked, Of wisdom what have you to say?\r\n\r\n23  And Jesus said, It is the consciousness that man is aught; that God\r\nand man are one;\r\n\r\n24  That naught is naught; that power is but illusion; that heaven and\r\nearth and hell are not above, around, below, but in; which in the\r\nlight of aught becomes the naught, and God is all.\r\n\r\n25  Lamaas asked, Pray, what is faith?\r\n\r\n26  And Jesus said, Faith is the surety of the omnipotence of God and\r\nman; the certainty that man will reach deific life.\r\n\r\n27  Salvation is a ladder reaching from the heart of man to heart of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n28  It has three steps; Belief is first, and this is what man thinks,\r\nperhaps, is truth.\r\n\r\n29  And faith is next, and this is what man knows is truth.\r\n\r\n30  Fruition is the last, and this is man himself, the truth.\r\n\r\n31  Belief is lost in faith; and in fruition faith is lost; and man is\r\nsaved when he has reached deific life; when he and God are one.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 23.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus and Lamaas among the sudras and visyas. In Benares.\r\n      Jesus becomes a pupil of Udraka. The lessons of Udraka._\r\n\r\nNow, Jesus with his friend Lamaas went through all the regions of\r\nOrissa, and the valley of the Ganges, seeking wisdom from the sudras\r\nand the visyas and the masters.\r\n\r\n2  Benares of the Ganges was a city rich in culture and in learning;\r\nhere the two rabbonis tarried many days.\r\n\r\n3  And Jesus sought to learn the Hindu art of healing, and became the\r\npupil of Udraka, greatest of the Hindu healers.\r\n\r\n4  Udraka taught the uses of the waters, plants and earths; of heat and\r\ncold; sunshine and shade; of light and dark.\r\n\r\n5  He said, The laws of nature are the laws of health, and he who lives\r\naccording to these laws is never sick.\r\n\r\n6  Transgression of these laws is sin, and he who sins is sick.\r\n\r\n7  He who obeys the laws, maintains an equilibrium in all his parts,\r\nand thus insures true harmony; and harmony is health, while discord is\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n8  That which produces harmony in all the parts of man is medicine,\r\ninsuring health.\r\n\r\n9  The body is a harpsichord, and when its strings are too relaxed, or\r\nare too tense, the instrument is out of tune, the man is sick.\r\n\r\n10  Now, everything in nature has been made to meet the wants of man;\r\nso everything is found in medical arcanes.\r\n\r\n11  And when the harpsichord of man is out of tune the vast expanse of\r\nnature may be searched for remedy; there is a cure for every ailment\r\nof the flesh.\r\n\r\n12  Of course the will of man is remedy supreme; and by the vigorous\r\nexercise of will, man may make tense a chord that is relaxed, or may\r\nrelax one that is too tense, and thus may heal himself.\r\n\r\n13  When man has reached the place where he has faith in God, in nature\r\nand himself, he knows the Word of power; his word is balm for every\r\nwound, is cure for all the ills of life.\r\n\r\n14  The healer is the man who can inspire faith. The tongue may speak\r\nto human ears, but souls are reached by souls that speak to souls.\r\n\r\n15  He is the forceful man whose soul is large, and who can enter into\r\nsouls, inspiring hope in those who have no hope, and faith in those\r\nwho have no faith in God, in nature, nor in man.\r\n\r\n16  There is no universal balm for those who tread the common walks of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n17  A thousand things produce inharmony and make men sick; a thousand\r\nthings may tune the harpsichord, and make men well.\r\n\r\n18  That which is medicine for one is poison for another one; so one is\r\nhealed by what would kill another one.\r\n\r\n19  An herb may heal the one; a drink of water may restore another one;\r\na mountain breeze may bring to life one seeming past all help;\r\n\r\n20  A coal of fire, or bit of earth, may cure another one; and one may\r\nwash in certain streams, or pools, and be made whole.\r\n\r\n21  The virtue from the hand or breath may heal a thousand more; but\r\nlove is queen. Thought, reinforced by love, is God’s great sovereign\r\nbalm.\r\n\r\n22  But many of the broken chords in life, and discords that so vex the\r\nsoul, are caused by evil spirits of the air that men see not; that\r\nlead men on through ignorance to break the laws of nature and of God.\r\n\r\n23  These powers act like demons, and they speak; they rend the man;\r\nthey drive him to despair.\r\n\r\n24  But he who is a healer, true, is master of the soul, and can, by\r\nforce of will, control these evil ones.\r\n\r\n25  Some spirits of the air are master spirits and are strong, too\r\nstrong for human power alone; but man has helpers in the higher realms\r\nthat may be importuned, and they will help to drive the demons out.\r\n\r\n26  Of what this great physician said, this is the sum. And Jesus bowed\r\nhis head in recognition of the wisdom of this master soul, and went\r\nhis way.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 24.\r\n\r\n    _The Brahmic doctrine of castes. Jesus repudiates it and\r\n      teaches human equality. The priests are offended and drive\r\n      him from the temple. He abides with the sudras and teaches\r\n      them._\r\n\r\nFour years the Jewish boy abode in temple Jagannath.\r\n\r\n2  One day he sat among the priests and said to them, Pray, tell me all\r\nabout your views of castes; why do you say that all men are not equal\r\nin the sight of God?\r\n\r\n3  A master of their laws stood forth and said, The Holy One whom we\r\ncall Brahm, made men to suit himself, and men should not complain.\r\n\r\n4  In the beginning days of human life Brahm spoke, and four men stood\r\nbefore his face.\r\n\r\n5  Now, from the mouth of Parabrahm the first man came; and he was\r\nwhite, was like the Brahm himself; a brahman he was called.\r\n\r\n6  And he was high and lifted up; above all want he stood; he had no\r\nneed of toil.\r\n\r\n7  And he was called the priest of Brahm, the holy one to act for Brahm\r\nin all affairs of earth.\r\n\r\n8  The second man was red, and from the hand of Parabrahm he came; and\r\nhe was called shatriya.\r\n\r\n9  And he was made to be the king, the ruler and the warrior, whose\r\nhighest ordained duty was, protection of the priest.\r\n\r\n10  And from the inner parts of Parabrahm the third man came; and he\r\nwas called a visya.\r\n\r\n11  He was a yellow man, and his it was to till the soil, and keep the\r\nflocks and herds.\r\n\r\n12  And from the feet of Parabrahm the fourth man came; and he was\r\nblack; and he was called the sudras, one of low estate.\r\n\r\n13  The sudras is the servant of the race of men; he has no rights that\r\nothers need respect; he may not hear the Vedas read, and it means\r\ndeath to him to look into the face of priest, or king, and naught but\r\ndeath can free him from his state of servitude.\r\n\r\n14  And Jesus said, Then Parabrahm is not a God of justice and of\r\nright; for with his own strong hand he has exalted one and brought\r\nanother low.\r\n\r\n15  And Jesus said no more to them, but looking up to heaven he said,\r\n\r\n16  My Father-God, who was, and is, and ever more shall be; who holds\r\nwithin thy hands the scales of justice and of right;\r\n\r\n17  Who in the boundlessness of love has made all men to equal be. The\r\nwhite, the black, the yellow and the red can look up in thy face and\r\nsay, Our Father-God.\r\n\r\n18  Thou Father of the human race, I praise thy name.\r\n\r\n19  And all the priests were angered by the words which Jesus spoke;\r\nthey rushed upon him, seized him, and would have done him harm.\r\n\r\n20  But then Lamaas raised his hand and said, You priests of Brahm,\r\nbeware! you know not what you do; wait till you know the God this\r\nyouth adores.\r\n\r\n21  I have beheld this boy at prayer when light above the light of sun\r\nsurrounded him, Beware! his God may be more powerful than Brahm.\r\n\r\n22  If Jesus speaks the truth, if he is right, you cannot force him\r\nto desist; if he is wrong and you are right, his words will come to\r\nnaught, for right is might, and in the end it will prevail.\r\n\r\n23  And then the priests refrained from doing Jesus harm; but one spoke\r\nout and said,\r\n\r\n24  Within this holy place has not this reckless youth done violence to\r\nParabrahm? The law is plain; it says, He who reviles the name of Brahm\r\nshall die.\r\n\r\n25  Lamaas plead for Jesus’ life; and then the priests just seized a\r\nscourge of cords and drove him from the place.\r\n\r\n26  And Jesus went his way and found a shelter with the black and\r\nyellow men, the servants and the tillers of the soil.\r\n\r\n27  To them he first made known the gospel of equality; he told them of\r\nthe Brotherhood of Man, the Fatherhood of God.\r\n\r\n28  The common people heard him with delight, and learned to pray, Our\r\nFather-God who art in heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 25.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus teaches the sudras and farmers.

Makes known the possibilities\r\n      of all men._\r\n\r\nWhen Jesus saw the sudras and the farmers in such multitudes draw near\r\nto hear his words, he spoke a parable to them; he said:\r\n\r\n2  A nobleman possessed a great estate; he had four sons, and he would\r\nhave them all grow strong by standing forth and making use of all the\r\ntalents they possessed.\r\n\r\n3  And so he gave to each a share of his great wealth, and bade them go\r\ntheir way.\r\n\r\n4  The eldest son was full of self; he was ambitious, shrewd and quick\r\nof thought.\r\n\r\n5  He said within himself, I am the oldest son, and these, my brothers,\r\nmust be servants at my feet,\r\n\r\n6  And then he called his brothers forth; and one he made a puppet\r\nking; gave him a sword and charged him to defend the whole estate.\r\n\r\n7  To one he gave the use of lands and flowing wells, and flocks and\r\nherds, and bade him till the soil, and tend the flocks and herds and\r\nbring to him the choicest of his gains.\r\n\r\n8  And to the other one he said, You are the youngest son; the broad\r\nestate has been assigned; you have no part nor lot in anything that is.\r\n\r\n9  And then he took a chain and bound his brother to a naked rock upon\r\na desert plain, and said to him,\r\n\r\n10  You have been born a slave; you have no rights, and you must be\r\ncontented with your lot, for there is no release for you until you die\r\nand go from hence.\r\n\r\n11  Now, after certain years the day of reckoning came; the nobleman\r\ncalled up his sons to render their accounts.\r\n\r\n12  And when he knew that one, his eldest son, had seized the whole\r\nestate and made his brothers slaves,\r\n\r\n13  He seized him, tore his priestly robes away and put him in a prison\r\ncell, where he was forced to stay until he had atoned for all the\r\nwrongs that he had done.\r\n\r\n14  And then, as though they were but toys, he threw in air the throne\r\nand armor of the puppet king; he broke his sword, and put him in a\r\nprison cell.\r\n\r\n15  And then he called his farmer son and asked him why he had not\r\nrescued from his galling chains his brother on the desert sands.\r\n\r\n16  And when the son made answer not, the father took unto himself the\r\nflocks and herds, the fields and flowing wells,\r\n\r\n17  And sent his farmer son to live out on the desert sands, until he\r\nhad atoned for all the wrongs that he had done.\r\n\r\n18  And then the father went and found his youngest son in cruel\r\nchains; with his own hands he broke the chains and bade his son to go\r\nin peace.\r\n\r\n19  Now, when the sons had all paid up their debts they came again and\r\nstood before the bar of right.\r\n\r\n20  They all had learned their lessons, learned them well; and then the\r\nfather once again divided the estate.\r\n\r\n21  He gave to each an equal share, and bade them recognize the law of\r\nequity and right, and live in peace.\r\n\r\n22  And one, a sudras, spoke and said, May we who are but slaves, who\r\nare cut down like beasts to satisfy the whims of priests--may we have\r\nhope that one will come to break our chains and set us free?\r\n\r\n23  And Jesus said, The Holy One has said, that all his children shall\r\nbe free; and every soul is child of God.\r\n\r\n24  The sudras shall be free as priest; the farmer shall walk hand in\r\nhand with king; for all the world will own the brotherhood of man.\r\n\r\n25  O men, arise! be conscious of your powers, for he who wills need\r\nnot remain a slave.\r\n\r\n26  Just live as you would have your brother live; unfold each day as\r\ndoes the flower; for earth is yours, and heaven is yours, and God will\r\nbring you to your own.\r\n\r\n27  And all the people cried, Show us the way that like the flower we\r\nmay unfold and come unto our own.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 26.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus at Katak. The car of Jagannath. Jesus reveals to the\r\n      people the emptiness of Brahmic rites, and how to see God in\r\n      man. Teaches them the divine law of sacrifice._\r\n\r\nIn all the cities of Orissa Jesus taught. At Katak, by the river side,\r\nhe taught, and thousands of the people followed him.\r\n\r\n2  One day a car of Jagannath was hauled along by scores of frenzied\r\nmen, and Jesus said,\r\n\r\n3  Behold, a form without a spirit passes by; a body with no soul; a\r\ntemple with no altar fires.\r\n\r\n4  This car of Krishna is an empty thing, for Krishna is not there.\r\n\r\n5  This car is but an idol of a people drunk on wine of carnal things.\r\n\r\n6  God lives not in the noise of tongues; there is no way to him from\r\nany idol shrine.\r\n\r\n7  God’s meeting place with man is in the heart, and in a still small\r\nvoice he speaks; and he who hears is still.\r\n\r\n8  And all the people said, Teach us to know the Holy One who speaks\r\nwithin the heart, God of the still small voice.\r\n\r\n9  And Jesus said, The Holy Breath cannot be seen with mortal eyes; nor\r\ncan men see the Spirits of the Holy One;\r\n\r\n10  But in their image man was made, and he who looks into the face of\r\nman, looks at the image of the God who speaks within.\r\n\r\n11  And when man honors man he honors God, and what man does for man,\r\nhe does for God.\r\n\r\n12  And you must bear in mind that when man harms in thought, or word\r\nor deed another man, he does a wrong to God.\r\n\r\n13  If you would serve the God who speaks within the heart, just serve\r\nyour near of kin, and those that are no kin, the stranger at your\r\ngates, the foe who seeks to do you harm;\r\n\r\n14  Assist the poor, and help the weak; do harm to none, and covet not\r\nwhat is not yours;\r\n\r\n15  Then, with your tongue the Holy One will speak; and he will smile\r\nbehind your tears, will light your countenance with joy, and fill your\r\nhearts with peace.\r\n\r\n16  And then the people asked, To whom shall we bring gifts? Where\r\nshall we offer sacrifice?\r\n\r\n17  And Jesus said, Our Father-God asks not for needless waste of\r\nplant, of grain, of dove, of lamb.\r\n\r\n18  That which you burn on any shrine you throw away. No blessings can\r\nattend the one who takes the food from hungry mouths to be destroyed\r\nby fire.\r\n\r\n19  When you would offer sacrifice unto our God, just take your gift of\r\ngrain, or meat and lay it on the table of the poor.\r\n\r\n20  From it an incense will arise to heaven, which will return to you\r\nwith blessedness.\r\n\r\n21  Tear down your idols; they can hear you not; turn all your\r\nsacrificial altars into fuel for the flames.\r\n\r\n22  Make human hearts your altars, and burn your sacrifices with the\r\nfire of love.\r\n\r\n23  And all the people were entranced, and would have worshipped Jesus\r\nas a God; but Jesus said,\r\n\r\n24  I am your brother man just come to show the way to God; you shall\r\nnot worship man; praise God, the Holy One.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 27.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus attends a feast in Behar. Preaches a revolutionary\r\n      sermon on human equality. Relates the parable of the broken\r\n      blades._\r\n\r\nThe fame of Jesus as a teacher spread through all the land, and people\r\ncame from near and far to hear his words of truth.\r\n\r\n2  At Behar, on the sacred river of the Brahms, he taught for many days.\r\n\r\n3  And Ach, a wealthy man of Behar, made a feast in honor of his guest,\r\nand he invited every one to come.\r\n\r\n4  And many came; among them thieves, extortioners, and courtesans. And\r\nJesus sat with them and taught; but they who followed him were much\r\naggrieved because he sat with thieves and courtesans.\r\n\r\n5  And they upbraided him; they said, Rabboni, master of the wise, this\r\nday will be an evil day for you.\r\n\r\n6  The news will spread that you consort with courtesans and thieves,\r\nand men will shun you as they shun an asp.\r\n\r\n7  And Jesus answered them and said, A master never screens himself\r\nfor sake of reputation or of fame.\r\n\r\n8  These are but worthless baubles of the day; they rise and sink, like\r\nempty bottles on a stream; they are illusions and will pass away;\r\n\r\n9  They are the indices to what the thoughtless think; they are the\r\nnoise that people make; and shallow men judge merit by the noise.\r\n\r\n10  God and all master men judge men by what they are and not by what\r\nthey seem to be; not by their reputation and their fame.\r\n\r\n11  These courtesans and thieves are children of my Father-God; their\r\nsouls are just as precious in his sight as yours, or of the Brahmic\r\npriests.\r\n\r\n12  And they are working out the same life sums that you, who pride\r\nyourselves on your respectability and moral worth, are working out.\r\n\r\n13  And some of them have solved much harder sums than you have solved,\r\nyou men who look at them with scorn.\r\n\r\n14  Yes, they are sinners, and confess their guilt, while you are\r\nguilty, but are shrewd enough to have a polished coat to cover up your\r\nguilt.\r\n\r\n15  Suppose you men who scorn these courtesans, these drunkards and\r\nthese thieves, who know that you are pure in heart and life, that you\r\nare better far than they, stand forth that men may know just who you\r\nare.\r\n\r\n16  The sin lies in the wish, in the desire, not in the act.\r\n\r\n17  You covet other people’s wealth; you look at charming forms, and\r\ndeep within your hearts you lust for them.\r\n\r\n18  Deceit you practice every day, and wish for gold, for honor and for\r\nfame, just for your selfish selves.\r\n\r\n19  The man who covets is a thief, and she who lusts is courtesan. You\r\nwho are none of these speak out.\r\n\r\n20  Nobody spoke; the accusers held their peace.\r\n\r\n21  And Jesus said, The proof this day is all against those who have\r\naccused.\r\n\r\n22  The pure in heart do not accuse. The vile in heart who want to\r\ncover up their guilt with holy smoke of piety are ever loathing\r\ndrunkard, thief and courtesan.\r\n\r\n23  This loathing and this scorn is mockery, for if the tinseled coat\r\nof reputation could be torn away, the loud professor would be found to\r\nrevel in his lust, deceit, and many forms of secret sin.\r\n\r\n24  The man who spends his time in pulling other people’s weeds can\r\nhave no time to pull his own, and all the choicest flowers of life\r\nwill soon be choked and die, and nothing will remain but darnel,\r\nthistles, burs.\r\n\r\n25  And Jesus spoke a parable: he said, Behold, a farmer had great\r\nfields of ripened grain, and when he looked he saw that blades of many\r\nstalks of wheat were bent and broken down.\r\n\r\n26  And when he sent his reapers forth he said, We will not save the\r\nstalks of wheat that have the broken blades.\r\n\r\n27  Go forth and cut and burn the stalks with broken blades.\r\n\r\n28  And after many days he went to measure up his grain, but not a\r\nkernel could he find.\r\n\r\n29  And then he called the harvesters and said to them, Where is my\r\ngrain?\r\n\r\n30  They answered him and said, We did according to your word; we\r\ngathered up and burned the stalks with broken blades, and not a stalk\r\nwas left to carry to the barn.\r\n\r\n31  And Jesus said, If God saves only those who have no broken blades,\r\nwho have been perfect in his sight, who will be saved?\r\n\r\n32  And the accusers hung their heads in shame; and Jesus went his way.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 28.\r\n\r\n    _Udraka gives a feast in Jesus’ honor. Jesus speaks on the\r\n      unity of God and the brotherhood of life. Criticises the\r\n      priesthood. Becomes the guest of a farmer._\r\n\r\nBenares is the sacred city of the Brahms, and in Benares Jesus taught;\r\nUdraka was his host.\r\n\r\n2  Udraka made a feast in honor of his guest, and many high born Hindu\r\npriests and scribes were there.\r\n\r\n3  And Jesus said to them, With much delight I speak to you concerning\r\nlife--the brotherhood of life.\r\n\r\n4  The universal God is one, yet he is more than one; all things are\r\nGod; all things are one.\r\n\r\n5  By the sweet breaths of God all life is bound in one; so if you\r\ntouch a fiber of a living thing you send a thrill from center to the\r\nouter bounds of life.\r\n\r\n6  And when you crush beneath your foot the meanest worm, you shake the\r\nthrone of God, and cause the sword of right to tremble in its sheath.\r\n\r\n7  The bird sings out its song for men, and men vibrate in unison to\r\nhelp it sing.\r\n\r\n8  The ant constructs her home, the bee its sheltering comb, the spider\r\nweaves her web, and flowers breathe to them a spirit in their sweet\r\nperfumes that gives them strength to toil.\r\n\r\n9  Now, men and birds and beasts and creeping things are deities, made\r\nflesh; and how dare men kill anything?\r\n\r\n10  ’Tis cruelty that makes the world awry. When men have learned that\r\nwhen they harm a living thing they harm themselves, they surely will\r\nnot kill, nor cause a thing that God has made to suffer pain.\r\n\r\n11  A lawyer said, I pray you, Jesus, tell who is this God you speak\r\nabout; where are his priests, his temples and his shrines?\r\n\r\n12  And Jesus said, The God I speak about is every where; he cannot be\r\ncompassed with walls, nor hedged about with bounds of any kind.\r\n\r\n13  All people worship God, the One; but all the people see him not\r\nalike.\r\n\r\n14  This universal God is wisdom, will and love.\r\n\r\n15  All men see not the Triune God. One sees him as the God of might;\r\nanother as the God of thought; another as the God of love.\r\n\r\n16  A man’s ideal is his God, and so, as man unfolds, his God unfolds.\r\nMan’s God today, tomorrow is not God.\r\n\r\n17  The nations of the earth see God from different points of view, and\r\nso he does not seem the same to every one.\r\n\r\n18  Man names the part of God he sees, and this to him is all of God;\r\nand every nation sees a part of God, and every nation has a name for\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n19  You Brahmans call him Parabrahm; in Egypt he is Thoth; and Zeus is\r\nhis name in Greece; Jehovah is his Hebrew name; but everywhere he is\r\nthe causeless Cause, the rootless Root from which all things have\r\ngrown.\r\n\r\n20  When men become afraid of God, and take him for a foe, they dress\r\nup other men in fancy garbs and call them priests,\r\n\r\n21  And charge them to restrain the wrath of God by prayers; and when\r\nthey fail to win his favor by their prayers, to buy him off with\r\nsacrifice of animal, or bird,\r\n\r\n22  When man sees God as one with him, as Father-God, he needs no\r\nmiddle man, no priest to intercede;\r\n\r\n23  He goes straight up to him and says, My Father-God! and then he\r\nlays his hand in God’s own hand, and all is well.\r\n\r\n24  And this is God. You are, each one, a priest, just for yourself;\r\nand sacrifice of blood God does not want.\r\n\r\n25  Just give your life in sacrificial service to the all of life, and\r\nGod is pleased.\r\n\r\n26  When Jesus had thus said he stood aside; the people were amazed,\r\nbut strove among themselves.\r\n\r\n27  Some said, He is inspired by Holy Brahm; and others said, He is\r\ninsane; and others said, He is obsessed; he speaks as devils speak.\r\n\r\n28  But Jesus tarried not. Among the guests was one, a tiller of the\r\nsoil, a generous soul, a seeker after truth, who loved the words that\r\nJesus spoke; and Jesus went with him, and in his home abode.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 29.\r\n\r\n    _Ajainin, a priest from Lahore, comes to Benares to see Jesus,\r\n      and abides in the temple. Jesus refuses an invitation to\r\n      visit the temple. Ajainin visits him at night in the farmer’s\r\n      home, and accepts his philosophy._\r\n\r\nAmong Benares’ temple priests was one, a guest, Ajainin, from Lahore.\r\n\r\n2  By merchantmen Ajainin heard about the Jewish boy, about his words\r\nof wisdom, and he girt himself and journeyed from Lahore that he might\r\nsee the boy, and hear him speak.\r\n\r\n3  The Brahmic priests did not accept the truth that Jesus brought, and\r\nthey were angered much by what he said at the Udraka feast.\r\n\r\n4  But they had never seen the boy, and they desired much to hear him\r\nspeak, and they invited him to be a temple guest.\r\n\r\n5  But Jesus said to them, The light is most abundant, and it shines\r\nfor all; if you would see the light come to the light.\r\n\r\n6  If you would hear the message that the Holy One has given me to give\r\nto men, come unto me.\r\n\r\n7  Now, when the priests were told what Jesus said they were enraged.\r\n\r\n8  Ajainin did not share their wrath, and he sent forth another\r\nmessenger with costly gifts to Jesus at the farmer’s home; he sent\r\nthis message with the gifts:\r\n\r\n9  I pray you, master, listen to my words; The Brahmic law forbids that\r\nany priest shall go into the home of any one of low estate; but you\r\ncan come to us;\r\n\r\n10  And I am sure these priests will gladly hear you speak. I pray that\r\nyou will come and dine with us this day.\r\n\r\n11  And Jesus said, The Holy One regards all men alike; the dwelling of\r\nmy host is good enough for any council of the sons of men.\r\n\r\n12  If pride of caste keeps you away, you are not worthy of the light.\r\nMy Father-God does not regard the laws of man.\r\n\r\n13  Your presents I return; you cannot buy the knowledge of the Lord\r\nwith gold, or precious gifts.\r\n\r\n14  These words of Jesus angered more and more the priests, and they\r\nbegan to plot and plan how they might drive him from the land.\r\n\r\n15  Ajainin did not join with them in plot and plan; he left the temple\r\nin the night, and sought the home where Jesus dwelt.\r\n\r\n16  And Jesus said, There is no night where shines the sun; I have no\r\nsecret messages to give; in light all secrets are revealed.\r\n\r\n17  Ajainin said, I came from far-away Lahore, that I might learn about\r\nthis ancient wisdom, and this kingdom of the Holy One of which you\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n18  Where is the kingdom? where the king? Who are the subjects? what\r\nits laws?\r\n\r\n19  And Jesus said, This kingdom is not far away, but man with mortal\r\neyes can see it not; it is within the heart.\r\n\r\n20  You need not seek the king in earth, or sea, or sky; he is not\r\nthere, and yet is everywhere. He is the Christ of God; is universal\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n21  The gate of this dominion is not high, and he who enters it must\r\nfall down on his knees. It is not wide, and none can carry carnal\r\nbundles through.\r\n\r\n22  The lower self must be transmuted into spirit-self; the body must\r\nbe washed in living streams of purity.\r\n\r\n23  Ajainin asked, Can I become a subject of this king?\r\n\r\n24  And Jesus said, You are yourself a king, and you may enter through\r\nthe gate and be a subject of the King of kings.\r\n\r\n25  But you must lay aside your priestly robes; must cease to serve the\r\nHoly One for gold; must give your life, and all you have, in willing\r\nservice to the sons of men.\r\n\r\n26  And Jesus said no more; Ajainin went his way; and while he could\r\nnot comprehend the truth that Jesus spoke, he saw what he had never\r\nseen before.\r\n\r\n27  The realm of faith he never had explored; but in his heart the\r\nseeds of faith and universal brotherhood had found good soil.\r\n\r\n28  And as he journeyed to his home he seemed to sleep, to pass through\r\ndarkest night, and when he woke the Sun of Righteousness had arisen;\r\nhe had found the king.\r\n\r\n29  Now, in Benares Jesus tarried many days and taught.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 30.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus receives news of the death of his father. He writes a\r\n      letter to his mother. The letter. He sends it on its way by a\r\n      merchant._\r\n\r\nOne day as Jesus stood beside the Ganges busy with his work, a\r\ncaravan, returning from the West, drew near.\r\n\r\n2  And one, approaching Jesus, said, We come to you just from your\r\nnative land and bring unwelcome news.\r\n\r\n3  Your father is no more on earth; your mother grieves; and none can\r\ncomfort her. She wonders whether you are still alive or not; she longs\r\nto see you once again.\r\n\r\n4  And Jesus bowed his head in silent thought; and then he wrote. Of\r\nwhat he wrote this is the sum:\r\n\r\n5  My mother, noblest of woman kind; A man just from my native land has\r\nbrought me word that father is no more in flesh, and that you grieve,\r\nand are disconsolate.\r\n\r\n6  My mother, all is well; is well for father and is well for you.\r\n\r\n7  His work in this earth-round is done, and it is nobly done.\r\n\r\n8  In all the walks of life men cannot charge him with deceit,\r\ndishonesty, nor wrong intent.\r\n\r\n9  Here in this round he finished many heavy tasks, and he has gone\r\nfrom hence prepared to solve the problems of the round of soul.\r\n\r\n10  Our Father-God is with him there, as he was with him here; and\r\nthere his angel guards his footsteps lest he goes astray.\r\n\r\n11  Why should you weep? Tears cannot conquer grief. There is no power\r\nin grief to mend a broken heart.\r\n\r\n12  The plane of grief is idleness; the busy soul can never grieve; it\r\nhas no time for grief.\r\n\r\n13  When grief comes trooping through the heart, just lose yourself;\r\nplunge deep into the ministry of love, and grief is not.\r\n\r\n14  Yours is a ministry of love, and all the world is calling out for\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n15  Then let the past go with the past; rise from the cares of carnal\r\nthings and give your life for those who live.\r\n\r\n16  And if you lose your life in serving life you will be sure to find\r\nin it the morning sun, the evening dews, in song of bird, in flowers,\r\nand in the stars of night.\r\n\r\n17  In just a little while your problems of this earth-round will be\r\nsolved; and when your sums are all worked out it will be pleasure\r\nunalloyed for you to enter wider fields of usefulness, to solve the\r\ngreater problems of the soul.\r\n\r\n18  Strive, then, to be content, and I will come to you some day and\r\nbring you richer gifts than gold or precious stones.\r\n\r\n19  I’m sure that John will care for you, supplying all your needs; and\r\nI am with you all the way, Jehoshua.\r\n\r\n20  And by the hand of one, a merchant, going to Jerusalem, he sent\r\nthis letter on its way.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 31.\r\n\r\n    _Brahmic priests are enraged because of Jesus’ teaching and\r\n      resolve to drive him from India. Lamaas pleads for him.\r\n      Priests employ a murderer to kill him. Lamaas warns him and\r\n      he flees to Nepel._\r\n\r\nThe words and works of Jesus caused unrest through all the land.\r\n\r\n2  The common people were his friends, believed in him, and followed\r\nhim in throngs.\r\n\r\n3  The priests and rulers were afraid of him; his very name sent terror\r\nto their hearts.\r\n\r\n4  He preached the brotherhood of life, the righteousness of equal\r\nrights, and taught the uselessness of priests, and sacrificial rites.\r\n\r\n5  He shook the very sand on which the Brahmic system stood; he made\r\nthe Brahmic idols seem so small, and sacrifice so fraught with sin,\r\nthat shrines and wheels of prayer were all forgot.\r\n\r\n6  The priests declared that if this Hebrew boy should tarry longer in\r\nthe land a revolution would occur; the common people would arise and\r\nkill the priests, and tear the temples down.\r\n\r\n7  And so they sent a call abroad, and priests from every province\r\ncame. Benares was on fire with Brahmic zeal.\r\n\r\n8  Lamaas from the temple Jagannath, who knew the inner life of Jesus\r\nwell, was in their midst, and heard the rantings of the priests,\r\n\r\n9  And he stood forth and said, My brother priests, take heed, be\r\ncareful what you do; this is a record-making day.\r\n\r\n10  The world is looking on; the very life of Brahmic thought is now on\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\n11  If we are reason-blind; if prejudice be king today; if we resort to\r\nbeastly force, and dye our hands in blood that may, in sight of Brahm,\r\nbe innocent and pure,\r\n\r\n12  His vengeance may fall down on us; the very rock on which we stand\r\nmay burst beneath our feet; and our beloved priesthood, and our laws\r\nand shrines will go into decay.\r\n\r\n13  But they would let him speak no more. The wrathful priests rushed\r\nup and beat him, spit upon him, called him traitor, threw him,\r\nbleeding, to the street.\r\n\r\n14  And then confusion reigned; the priests became a mob; the sight of\r\nhuman blood led on to fiendish acts, and called for more.\r\n\r\n15  The rulers, fearing war, sought Jesus, and they found him calmly\r\nteaching in the market-place.\r\n\r\n16  They urged him to depart, that he might save his life; but he\r\nrefused to go.\r\n\r\n17  And then the priests sought cause for his arrest; but he had done\r\nno crime.\r\n\r\n18  And then false charges were preferred; but when the soldiers went\r\nto bring him to the judgment hall they were afraid, because the people\r\nstood in his defense.\r\n\r\n19  The priests were baffled, and they resolved to take his life by\r\nstealth.\r\n\r\n20  They found a man who was a murderer by trade, and sent him out by\r\nnight to slay the object of their wrath.\r\n\r\n21  Lamaas heard about their plotting and their plans, and sent a\r\nmessenger to warn his friend; and Jesus hastened to depart.\r\n\r\n22  By night he left Benares, and with haste he journeyed to the north;\r\nand everywhere, the farmers, merchants and the sudras helped him on\r\nhis way.\r\n\r\n23  And after many days he reached the mighty Himalayas, and in the\r\ncity Kapivastu he abode.\r\n\r\n24  The priests of Buddha opened wide their temple doors for him.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 32.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus and Barata. Together they read the sacred books. Jesus\r\n      takes exception to the Buddhist doctrine of evolution and\r\n      reveals the true origin of man. Meets Vidyapati, who becomes\r\n      his co-laborer._\r\n\r\nAmong the Buddhist priests was one who saw a lofty wisdom in the words\r\nthat Jesus spoke. It was Barata Arabo.\r\n\r\n2  Together Jesus and Barata read the Jewish Psalms and Prophets; read\r\nthe Vedas, the Avesta and the wisdom of Guatama.\r\n\r\n3  And as they read and talked about the possibilities of man, Barata\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n4  Man is the marvel of the universe. He is a part of everything, for\r\nhe has been a living thing on every plane of life.\r\n\r\n5  Time was when man was not; and then he was a bit of formless\r\nsubstance in the molds of time; and then a protoplast.\r\n\r\n6  By universal law all things tend upward to a state of perfectness.\r\nThe protoplast evolved, becoming worm, then reptile, bird and beast,\r\nand then at last it reached the form of man.\r\n\r\n7  Now, man himself is mind, and mind is here to gain perfection by\r\nexperience; and mind is often manifest in fleshy form, and in the\r\nform best suited to its growth. So mind may manifest as worm, or bird,\r\nor beast, or man.\r\n\r\n8  The time will come when everything of life will be evolved unto the\r\nstate of perfect man.\r\n\r\n9  And after man is man in perfectness, he will evolve to higher forms\r\nof life.\r\n\r\n10  And Jesus said, Barata Arabo, who taught you this, that mind, which\r\nis the man, may manifest in flesh of beast, or bird, or creeping thing?\r\n\r\n11  Barata said, From times which man remembers not our priests have\r\ntold us so, and so we know.\r\n\r\n12  And Jesus said, Enlightened Arabo, are you a master mind and do not\r\nknow that man knows naught by being told?\r\n\r\n13  Man may believe what others say; but thus he never knows. If man\r\nwould know, he must himself be what he knows.\r\n\r\n14  Do you remember, Arabo, when you was ape, or bird, or worm?\r\n\r\n15  Now, if you have no better proving of your plea than that the\r\npriests have told you so, you do not know; you simply guess.\r\n\r\n16  Regard not, then, what any man has said; let us forget the flesh,\r\nand go with mind into the land of fleshless things; mind never does\r\nforget.\r\n\r\n17  And backward through the ages master minds can trace themselves;\r\nand thus they know.\r\n\r\n18  Time never was when man was not.\r\n\r\n19  That which begins will have an end. If man was not, the time will\r\ncome when he will not exist.\r\n\r\n20  From God’s own Record Book we read: The Triune God breathed forth,\r\nand seven Spirits stood before his face. (The Hebrews call these seven\r\nSpirits, Elohim.)\r\n\r\n21  And these are they who, in their boundless power, created\r\neverything that is, or was.\r\n\r\n22  These Spirits of the Triune God moved on the face of boundless\r\nspace and seven ethers were, and every ether had its form of life.\r\n\r\n23  These forms of life were but the thoughts of God, clothed in the\r\nsubstance of their ether planes.\r\n\r\n24  (Men call these ether planes the planes of protoplast, of earth, of\r\nplant, of beast, of man, of angel and of cherubim.)\r\n\r\n25  These planes with all their teeming thoughts of God, are never seen\r\nby eyes of man in flesh; they are composed of substance far too fine\r\nfor fleshly eyes to see, and still they constitute the soul of things;\r\n\r\n26  And with the eyes of soul all creatures see these ether planes, and\r\nall the forms of life.\r\n\r\n27  Because all forms of life on every plane are thoughts of God, all\r\ncreatures think, and every creature is possessed of will, and, in its\r\nmeasure, has the power to choose,\r\n\r\n28  And in their native planes all creatures are supplied with\r\nnourishment from the ethers of their planes.\r\n\r\n29  And so it was with every living thing until the will became a\r\nsluggish will, and then the ethers of the protoplast, the earth, the\r\nplant, the beast, the man, began to vibrate very slow.\r\n\r\n30  The ethers all became more dense, and all the creatures of these\r\nplanes were clothed with coarser garbs, the garbs of flesh, which men\r\ncan see; and thus this coarser manifest, which men call physical,\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\n31  And this is what is called the fall of man; but man fell not alone\r\nfor protoplast, and earth, and plant and beast were all included in\r\nthe fall.\r\n\r\n32  The angels and the cherubim fell not; their wills were ever strong,\r\nand so they held the ethers of their planes in harmony with God.\r\n\r\n33  Now, when the ethers reached the rate of atmosphere, and all the\r\ncreatures of these planes must get their food from atmosphere, the\r\nconflict came; and then that which the finite man has called, survival\r\nof the best, became a law,\r\n\r\n34  The stronger ate the bodies of the weaker manifests; and here is\r\nwhere the carnal law of evolution had its rise.\r\n\r\n35  And now man, in his utter shamelessness, strikes down and eats the\r\nbeasts, the beast consumes the plant, the plant thrives on the earth,\r\nthe earth absorbs the protoplast.\r\n\r\n36  In yonder kingdom of the soul this carnal evolution is not known,\r\nand the great work of master minds is to restore the heritage of man,\r\nto bring him back to his estate that he has lost, when he again will\r\nlive upon the ethers of his native plane.\r\n\r\n37  The thoughts of God change not; the manifests of life on every\r\nplane unfold into perfection of their kind; and as the thoughts of God\r\ncan never die, there is no death to any being of the seven ethers of\r\nthe seven Spirits of the Triune God.\r\n\r\n38  And so an earth is never plant; a beast, or bird, or creeping thing\r\nis never man, and man is not, and cannot be, a beast, or bird, or\r\ncreeping thing.\r\n\r\n39  The time will come when all these seven manifests will be absorbed,\r\nand man, and beast, and plant, and earth and protoplast will be\r\nredeemed.\r\n\r\n40  Barata was amazed; the wisdom of the Jewish sage was revelation\r\nunto him.\r\n\r\n41  Now, Vidyapati, wisest of the Indian sages, chief of temple\r\nKapavistu, heard Barata speak to Jesus of the origin of man, and heard\r\nthe answer of the Hebrew prophet, and he said,\r\n\r\n42  You priests of Kapavistu, hear me speak: We stand today upon a\r\ncrest of time. Six times ago a master soul was born who gave a glory\r\nlight to man, and now a master sage stands here in temple Kapavistu.\r\n\r\n43  This Hebrew prophet is the rising star of wisdom, deified. He\r\nbrings to us a knowledge of the secret things of God; and all the\r\nworld will hear his words, will heed his words, and glorify his name.\r\n\r\n44  You priests of temple Kapavistu, stay! be still and listen when he\r\nspeaks; he is the Living Oracle of God.\r\n\r\n45  And all the priests gave thanks, and praised the Buddha of\r\nenlightenment.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 33.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus teaches the common people at a spring. Tells them how to\r\n      attain unto happiness. Relates the parable of the rocky field\r\n      and the hidden treasure._\r\n\r\nIn silent meditation Jesus sat beside a flowing spring. It was a holy\r\nday, and many people of the servant caste were near the place.\r\n\r\n2  And Jesus saw the hard drawn lines of toil on every brow, in every\r\nhand. There was no look of joy in any face. Not one of all the group\r\ncould think of anything but toil.\r\n\r\n3  And Jesus spoke to one and said, Why are you all so sad? Have you\r\nno happiness in life?\r\n\r\n4  The man replied, We scarcely know the meaning of that word. We toil\r\nto live, and hope for nothing else but toil, and bless the day when\r\nwe can cease our toil and lay us down to rest in Buddha’s city of the\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n5  And Jesus’ heart was stirred with pity and with love for these poor\r\ntoilers, and he said,\r\n\r\n6  Toil should not make a person sad; men should be happiest when they\r\ntoil. When hope and love are back of toil, then all of life is filled\r\nwith joy and peace, and this is heaven. Do you not know that such a\r\nheaven is for you?\r\n\r\n7  The man replied, Of heaven we have heard; but then it is so far\r\naway, and we must live so many lives before we reach that place!\r\n\r\n8  And Jesus said, My brother, man, your thoughts are wrong; your\r\nheaven is not far away; and it is not a place of metes and bounds, is\r\nnot a country to be reached; it is a state of mind.\r\n\r\n9  God never made a heaven for man; he never made a hell; we are\r\ncreators and we make our own.\r\n\r\n10  Now, cease to seek for heaven in the sky; just open up the windows\r\nof your hearts, and, like a flood of light, a heaven will come and\r\nbring a boundless joy; then toil will be no cruel task.\r\n\r\n11  The people were amazed, and gathered close to hear this strange\r\nyoung master speak,\r\n\r\n12  Imploring him to tell them more about the Father-God; about the\r\nheaven that men can make on earth; about the boundless joy.\r\n\r\n13  And Jesus spoke a parable; he said, A certain man possessed a\r\nfield; the soil was hard and poor.\r\n\r\n14  By constant toil he scarcely could provide enough of food to keep\r\nhis family from want.\r\n\r\n15  One day a miner who could see beneath the soil, in passing on his\r\nway, saw this poor man and his unfruitful field.\r\n\r\n16  He called the weary toiler and he said, My brother, know you not\r\nthat just below the surface of your barren field rich treasures lie\r\nconcealed?\r\n\r\n17  You plow and sow and reap in scanty way, and day by day you tread\r\nupon a mine of gold and precious stones.\r\n\r\n18  This wealth lies not upon the surface of the ground; but if you\r\nwill but dig away the rocky soil, and delve down deep into the earth,\r\nyou need no longer till the soil for naught.\r\n\r\n19  The man believed. The miner surely knows; he said, and I will find\r\nthe treasures hidden in my field.\r\n\r\n20  And then he dug away the rocky soil, and deep down in the earth he\r\nfound a mine of gold.\r\n\r\n21  And Jesus said, The sons of men are toiling hard on desert plains,\r\nand burning sands and rocky soils; are doing what their fathers did,\r\nnot dreaming they can do aught else.\r\n\r\n22  Behold, a master comes, and tells them of a hidden wealth; that\r\nunderneath the rocky soil of carnal things are treasures that no man\r\ncan count;\r\n\r\n23  That in the heart the richest gems abound; that he who wills may\r\nopen up the door and find them all.\r\n\r\n24  And then the people said, Make known to us the way that we may find\r\nthe wealth that lies within the heart.\r\n\r\n25  And Jesus opened up the way; the toilers saw another side of life,\r\nand toil became a joy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 34.\r\n\r\n    _The Jubilee in Kapavistu. Jesus teaches in the plaza and the\r\n      people are astonished. He relates the parable of the unkept\r\n      vineyard and the vine dresser. The priests are angered by his\r\n      words._\r\n\r\nIt was a gala day in sacred Kapavistu; a throng of Buddhist\r\nworshippers had met to celebrate a Jubilee.\r\n\r\n2  And priests and masters from all parts of India were there; they\r\ntaught; but they embellished little truth with many words.\r\n\r\n3  And Jesus went into an ancient plaza and he taught; he spoke of\r\nFather-Mother-God; he told about the brotherhood of life.\r\n\r\n4  The priests and all the people were astounded at his words and said,\r\nIs this not Buddha come again in flesh? No other one could speak with\r\nsuch simplicity and power.\r\n\r\n5  And Jesus spoke a parable; he said, There was a vineyard all unkept;\r\nthe vines were high, the growth of leaves and branches great.\r\n\r\n6  The leaves were broad and shut the sunlight from the vines; the\r\ngrapes were sour, and few, and small.\r\n\r\n7  The pruner came; with his sharp knife he cut off every branch, and\r\nnot a leaf remained; just root and stalk, and nothing more.\r\n\r\n8  The busy neighbors came with one accord and were amazed, and said to\r\nhim who pruned, You foolish man! the vineyard is despoiled.\r\n\r\n9  Such desolation! There is no beauty left, and when the harvest time\r\nshall come the gatherers will find no fruit.\r\n\r\n10  The pruner said, Content yourselves with what you think, and come\r\nagain at harvest time and see.\r\n\r\n11  And when the harvest time came on the busy neighbors came again;\r\nthey were surprised.\r\n\r\n12  The naked stalks had put forth branch and leaf, and heavy clusters\r\nof delicious grapes weighed every branch to earth.\r\n\r\n13  The gatherers rejoiced as, day by day, they carried the rich\r\nfruitage to the press.\r\n\r\n14  Behold, the vineyard of the Lord! the earth is spread with human\r\nvines.\r\n\r\n15  The gorgeous forms and rites of men are branches, and their words\r\nare leaves; and these have grown so great that sunlight can no longer\r\nreach the heart; there is no fruit.\r\n\r\n16  Behold, the pruner comes, and with a two-edged knife he cuts away\r\nthe branches and the leaves of words,\r\n\r\n17  And naught is left but unclothed stalks of human life.\r\n\r\n18  The priests and they of pompous show, rebuke the pruner, and would\r\nstay him in his work.\r\n\r\n19  They see no beauty in the stalks of human life; no promises of\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\n20  The harvest time will come and they who scorned the pruner will\r\nlook on again and be amazed, for they will see the human stalks that\r\nseemed so lifeless, bending low with precious fruit.\r\n\r\n21  And they will hear the harvesters rejoice, because the harvest is\r\nso great.\r\n\r\n22  The priests were not well pleased with Jesus’ words; but they\r\nrebuked him not; they feared the multitude.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 35.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus and Vidyapati consider the needs of the incoming age of\r\n      the world._\r\n\r\nThe Indian sage and Jesus often met and talked about the needs of\r\nnations and of men; about the sacred doctrines, forms and rites best\r\nsuited to the coming age.\r\n\r\n2  One day they sat together in a mountain pass, and Jesus said, The\r\ncoming age will surely not require priests, and shrines, and sacrifice\r\nof life.\r\n\r\n3  There is no power in sacrifice of beast, or bird, to help a man to\r\nholy life.\r\n\r\n4  And Vidyapati said, All forms and rites are symbols of the things\r\nthat men must do within the temple of the soul.\r\n\r\n5  The Holy One requires man to give his life in willing sacrifice for\r\nmen, and all the so-called offerings on altars and on shrines that\r\nhave been made since time began, were made to teach man how to give\r\nhimself to save his brother man; for man can never save himself except\r\nhe lose his life in saving other men.\r\n\r\n6  The perfect age will not require forms and rites and carnal\r\nsacrifice. The coming age is not the perfect age, and men will call\r\nfor object lessons and symbolic rites.\r\n\r\n7  And in the great religion you shall introduce to men, some simple\r\nrites of washings and remembrances will be required; but cruel\r\nsacrifice of animals, and birds the gods require not.\r\n\r\n8  And Jesus said, Our God must loathe the tinseled show of priests and\r\npriestly things.\r\n\r\n9  When men array themselves in showy garbs to indicate that they are\r\nservants of the gods, and strut about like gaudy birds to be admired\r\nby men, because of piety or any other thing, the Holy One must surely\r\nturn away in sheer disgust.\r\n\r\n10  All people are alike the servants of our Father-God, are kings and\r\npriests.\r\n\r\n11  Will not the coming age demand complete destruction of the priestly\r\ncaste, as well as every other caste and inequality among the sons of\r\nmen?\r\n\r\n12  And Vidyapati said, The coming age is not the age of spirit life\r\nand men will pride themselves in wearing priestly robes, and chanting\r\npious chants to advertise themselves as saints.\r\n\r\n13  The simple rites that you will introduce will be extolled by those\r\nwho follow you, until the sacred service of the age will far outshine\r\nin gorgeousness the priestly service of the Brahmic age.\r\n\r\n14  This is a problem men must solve.\r\n\r\n15  The perfect age will come when every man will be a priest and men\r\nwill not array themselves in special garb to advertise their piety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VII.\r\n\r\nZAIN.\r\n\r\n_Life and Works of Jesus in Tibet and Western India._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 36.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus in Lassa. He meets Meng-ste who aids him in reading the\r\n      ancient manuscripts. He goes to Ladak. Heals a child. Relates\r\n      the parable of the king’s son._\r\n\r\nIn Lassa of Tibet there was a master’s temple, rich in manuscripts of\r\nancient lore.\r\n\r\n2  The Indian sage had read these manuscripts, and he revealed to Jesus\r\nmany of the secret lessons they contained; but Jesus wished to read\r\nthem for himself.\r\n\r\n3  Now, Meng-ste, greatest sage of all the farther East, was in this\r\ntemple of Tibet.\r\n\r\n4  The path across Emodus heights was difficult; but Jesus started on\r\nhis way, and Vidyapati sent with him a trusted guide.\r\n\r\n5  And Vidyapati sent a message to Meng-ste, in which he told about the\r\nHebrew sage, and spoke for him a welcome by the temple priests.\r\n\r\n6  Now, after many days, and perils great, the guide and Jesus reached\r\nthe Lassa temple in Tibet.\r\n\r\n7  And Meng-ste opened wide the temple doors, and all the priests and\r\nmasters gave a welcome to the Hebrew sage.\r\n\r\n8  And Jesus had access to all the sacred manuscripts, and, with the\r\nhelp of Meng-ste, read them all.\r\n\r\n9  And Meng-ste often talked with Jesus of the coming age, and of the\r\nsacred service best adapted to the people of the age.\r\n\r\n10  In Lassa Jesus did not teach. When he had finished all his studies\r\nin the temple schools he journeyed toward the West. In many villages\r\nhe tarried for a time and taught.\r\n\r\n11  At last he reached the pass, and in the Ladak city, Leh, he was\r\nreceived with favor by the monks, the merchants, and the men of low\r\nestate.\r\n\r\n12  And in the monastery he abode, and taught; and then he sought the\r\ncommon people in the marts of trade; and there he taught.\r\n\r\n13  Not far away a woman lived, whose infant son was sick nigh unto\r\ndeath. The doctors had declared, There is no hope; the child must die.\r\n\r\n14  The woman heard that Jesus was a teacher sent from God, and she\r\nbelieved that he had power to heal her son.\r\n\r\n15  And so she clasped the dying infant in her arms and ran with haste\r\nand asked to see the man of God.\r\n\r\n16  When Jesus saw her faith he lifted up his eyes to heaven and said,\r\n\r\n17  My Father-God, let power divine o’ershadow me, and let the Holy\r\nBreath fill full this child that it may live.\r\n\r\n18  And in the presence of the multitude he laid his hand upon the\r\nchild and said,\r\n\r\n19  Good woman you are blest; your faith has saved your son. And then\r\nthe child was well.\r\n\r\n20  The people were astonished and they said, This surely is the Holy\r\nOne made flesh, for man alone cannot rebuke a fever thus and save a\r\nchild from death.\r\n\r\n21  Then many of the people brought their sick, and Jesus spoke the\r\nWord, and they were healed.\r\n\r\n22  Among the Ladaks Jesus tarried many days; he taught them how to\r\nheal; how sins are blotted out, and how to make on earth a heaven of\r\njoy.\r\n\r\n23  The people loved him for his words and works, and when he must\r\ndepart they grieved as children grieve when mother goes away.\r\n\r\n24  And on the morning when he started on his way the multitudes were\r\nthere to press his hand.\r\n\r\n25  To them he spoke a parable; he said, A certain king so loved the\r\npeople of his land that he sent forth his only son with precious gifts\r\nfor all.\r\n\r\n26  The son went everywhere and scattered forth the gifts with lavish\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n27  But there were priests who ministered at shrines of foreign gods,\r\nwho were not pleased because the king did not through them bestow the\r\ngifts.\r\n\r\n28  And so they sought to cause the people all to hate the son. They\r\nsaid, These gifts are not of any worth; they are but counterfeits.\r\n\r\n29  And so the people threw the precious gems, and gold and silver in\r\nthe streets. They caught the son and beat him, spit upon him, drove\r\nhim from their midst.\r\n\r\n30  The son resented not their insults and their cruelties; but thus he\r\nprayed, My Father-God, forgive these creatures of thy hand; they are\r\nbut slaves; they know not what they do.\r\n\r\n31  And while they yet were beating him he gave them food, and blest\r\nthem with a boundless love.\r\n\r\n32  In certain cities was the son received with joy, and he would\r\ngladly have remained to bless the homes; but he could tarry not, for\r\nhe must carry gifts to every one in all the king’s domain.\r\n\r\n33  And Jesus said, My Father-God is king of all mankind, and he\r\nhas sent me forth with all the bounties of his matchless love and\r\nboundless wealth.\r\n\r\n34  To all the people of all lands, lo, I must bear these gifts--this\r\nwater and this bread of life.\r\n\r\n35  I go my way, but we will meet again; for in my Fatherland is room\r\nfor all; I will prepare a place for you.\r\n\r\n36  And Jesus raised his hand in silent benediction; then he went his\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 37.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus is presented with a camel.

Jesus resumes his journey._\r\n\r\nA caravan of merchantmen were journeying through the Kashmar vale as\r\nJesus passed that way, and they were going to Lahore, a city of the\r\nHand, the five-stream land.\r\n\r\n2  The merchantmen had heard the prophet speak, had seen his mighty\r\nworks in Leh, and they were glad to see him once again.\r\n\r\n3  And when they knew that he was going to Lahore and then across the\r\nSind, through Persia and the farther West, and that he had no beast on\r\nwhich to ride,\r\n\r\n4  They freely gave to him a noble bactrian beast, well saddled and\r\nequipped, and Jesus journeyed with the caravan.\r\n\r\n5  And when he reached Lahore, Ajainin and some other Brahmic priests,\r\nreceived him with delight.\r\n\r\n6  Ajainin was the priest who came to Jesus in the night time in\r\nBenares many months before, and heard his words of truth.\r\n\r\n7  And Jesus was Ajainin’s guest; he taught Ajainin many things;\r\nrevealed to him the secrets of the healing art.\r\n\r\n8  He taught him how he could control the spirits of the air, the fire,\r\nthe water and the earth; and he explained to him the secret doctrine\r\nof forgiveness, and the blotting out of sins.\r\n\r\n9  One day Ajainin sat with Jesus in the temple porch; a band of\r\nwandering singers and musicians paused before the court to sing and\r\nplay.\r\n\r\n10  Their music was most rich and delicate, and Jesus said, Among the\r\nhigh-bred people of the land we hear no sweeter music than that these\r\nuncouth children of the wilderness bring here to us.\r\n\r\n11  From whence this talent and this power? In one short life they\r\nsurely could not gain such grace of voice, such knowledge of the laws\r\nof harmony and tone.\r\n\r\n12  Men call them prodigies. There are no prodigies. All things result\r\nfrom natural law.\r\n\r\n13  These people are not young. A thousand years would not suffice to\r\ngive them such divine expressiveness, and such purity of voice and\r\ntouch.\r\n\r\n14  Ten thousand years ago these people mastered harmony. In days of\r\nold they trod the busy thoroughfares of life, and caught the melody of\r\nbirds, and played on harps of perfect form.\r\n\r\n15  And they have come again to learn still other lessons from the\r\nvaried notes of manifests.\r\n\r\n16  These wandering people form a part of heaven’s orchestra, and in\r\nthe land of perfect things the very angels will delight to hear them\r\nplay and sing.\r\n\r\n17  And Jesus taught the common people of Lahore; he healed their sick,\r\nand showed to them the way to rise to better things by helpfulness.\r\n\r\n18  He said, We are not rich by what we get and hold; the only things\r\nwe keep are those we give away.\r\n\r\n19  If you would live the perfect life, give forth your life in service\r\nfor your kind, and for the forms of life that men esteem the lower\r\nforms of life.\r\n\r\n20  But Jesus could not tarry longer in Lahore; he bade the priests and\r\nother friends farewell; and then he took his camel and he went his way\r\ntoward the Sind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION VIII.\r\n\r\nCHETH.\r\n\r\n_Life and Works of Jesus in Persia._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 38.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus crosses Persia. Teaches and heals in many places. Three\r\n      magian priests meet him as he nears Persepolis. Kaspar, and\r\n      two other Persian masters, meet him in Persepolis. The seven\r\n      masters sit in silence seven days._\r\n\r\nFour-and-twenty years of age was Jesus when he entered Persia on his\r\nhomeward way.\r\n\r\n2  In many a hamlet, town and neighborhood he paused a while and taught\r\nand healed.\r\n\r\n3  The priests and ruling classes did not welcome him, because he\r\ncensured them for cruelty to those of low estate.\r\n\r\n4  The common people followed him in throngs.\r\n\r\n5  At times the chiefs made bold to try to hinder him, forbidding him\r\nto teach or heal the sick. But he regarded not their angry threats; he\r\ntaught, and healed the sick.\r\n\r\n6  In time he reached Persepolis, the city where the kings of Persia\r\nwere entombed; the city of the learned magi, Hor, and Lun, and Mer,\r\nthe three wise men,\r\n\r\n7  Who, two-and-twenty years before, had seen the star of promise\r\nrise above Jerusalem, and who had journeyed to the West to find the\r\nnew-born king;\r\n\r\n8  And were the first to honor Jesus as the master of the age, and gave\r\nhim gifts of gold, gum-thus and myrrh.\r\n\r\n9  These magi knew, by ways that masters always know, when Jesus\r\nneared Persepolis; and then they girt themselves, and went to meet him\r\non the way.\r\n\r\n10  And when they met, a light much brighter than the light of day,\r\nsurrounded them, and men who saw the four stand in the way declared\r\nthey were transfigured; seeming more like gods than men.\r\n\r\n11  Now, Hor and Lun were aged men, and Jesus placed them on his beast\r\nto ride into Persepolis; while he and Mer led on the way.\r\n\r\n12  And when they reached the magi’s home they all rejoiced. And Jesus\r\ntold the thrilling story of his life, and Hor and Lun and Mer spoke\r\nnot; they only looked to heaven, and in their hearts praised God.\r\n\r\n13  Three wise men from the North were in Persepolis; and they were\r\nKaspar, Zara and Melzone; and Kaspar was the wisest master of the\r\nmagian land. These three were at the home of Hor and Lun and Mer when\r\nJesus came.\r\n\r\n14  For seven days these seven men spoke not; they sat in silence in\r\nthe council hall in close communion with the Silent Brotherhood.\r\n\r\n15  They sought for light, for revelation and for power. The laws and\r\nprecepts of the coming age required all the wisdom of the masters of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 39.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus attends a feast in Persepolis. Speaks to the people,\r\n      reviewing the magian philosophy. Explains the origin of evil.\r\n      Spends the night in prayer._\r\n\r\nA feast in honor of the magian God was being held, and many men were\r\ngathered in Persepolis.\r\n\r\n2  And on the great day of the feast the ruling magian master said,\r\nWithin these sacred walls is liberty; whoever wills to speak may speak.\r\n\r\n3  And Jesus standing in the midst of all the people, said, My\r\nbrothers, sisters, children of our Father-God:\r\n\r\n4  Most blest are you among the sons of men today, because you have\r\nsuch just conceptions of the Holy One and man.\r\n\r\n5  Your purity in worship and in life is pleasing unto God; and to your\r\nmaster, Zarathustra, praise is due.\r\n\r\n6  Well say you all, There is one God from whose great being there came\r\nforth the seven Spirits that created heaven and earth; and manifest\r\nunto the sons of men are these great Spirits in the sun, and moon, and\r\nstars.\r\n\r\n7  But in your sacred books we read that two among these seven are of\r\nsuperior strength; that one of these created all the good; the other\r\none created all that evil is.\r\n\r\n8  I pray you, honored masters, tell me how that evil can be born of\r\nthat which is all good?\r\n\r\n9  A magus rose and said, If you will answer me, your problem will be\r\nsolved.\r\n\r\n10  We all do recognize the fact that evil is. Whatever is, must have a\r\ncause. If God, the One, made not this evil, then, where is the God who\r\ndid?\r\n\r\n11  And Jesus said, Whatever God, the One, has made is good, and like\r\nthe great first Cause, the seven Spirits all are good, and everything\r\nthat comes from their creative hands is good,\r\n\r\n12  Now, all created things have colors, tones and forms their own; but\r\ncertain tones, though good and pure themselves, when mixed, produce\r\ninharmonies, discordant tones.\r\n\r\n13  And certain things, though good and pure, when mixed, produce\r\ndiscordant things, yea, poisonous things, that men call evil things.\r\n\r\n14  So evil is the inharmonious blending of the colors, tones, or forms\r\nof good.\r\n\r\n15  Now, man is not all-wise, and yet has will his own. He has the\r\npower, and he uses it, to mix God’s good things in a multitude of\r\nways, and every day he makes discordant sounds, and evil things.\r\n\r\n16  And every tone and form, be it of good, or ill, becomes a living\r\nthing, a demon, sprite, or spirit of a good or vicious kind.\r\n\r\n17  Man makes his devil thus; and then becomes afraid of him and flees;\r\nhis devil is emboldened, follows him away and casts him into torturing\r\nfires.\r\n\r\n18  The devil and the burning fires are both the works of man, and none\r\ncan put the fires out and dissipate the evil one, but man who made\r\nthem both.\r\n\r\n19  Then Jesus stood aside, and not a magus answered him.\r\n\r\n20  And he departed from the throng and went into a secret place to\r\npray.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 40.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus teaches the magians. Explains the Silence and how to\r\n      enter it. Kaspar extols the wisdom of Jesus. Jesus teaches in\r\n      the groves of Cyrus._\r\n\r\nNow, in the early morning Jesus came again to teach and heal. A\r\nlight not comprehended shown about, as though some mighty spirit\r\novershadowed him.\r\n\r\n2  A magus noted this and asked him privately to tell from whence his\r\nwisdom came, and what the meaning of the light.\r\n\r\n3  And Jesus said, There is a Silence where the soul may meet its God,\r\nand there the fount of wisdom is, and all who enter are immersed in\r\nlight, and filled with wisdom, love and power.\r\n\r\n4  The magus said, Tell me about this Silence and this light, that I\r\nmay go and there abide.\r\n\r\n5  And Jesus said, The Silence is not circumscribed; is not a place\r\nclosed in with wall, or rocky steeps, nor guarded by the sword of man.\r\n\r\n6  Men carry with them all the time the secret place where they may\r\nmeet their God.\r\n\r\n7  It matters not where men abide, on mountain top, in deepest vale, in\r\nmarts of trade, or in the quiet home; they may at once, at any time,\r\nfling wide the door, and find the Silence, find the house of God; it\r\nis within the soul.\r\n\r\n8  One may not be so much disturbed by noise of business, and the\r\nwords and thoughts of men if he goes all alone into the valley or the\r\nmountain pass.\r\n\r\n9  And when life’s heavy load is pressing hard, it is far better to go\r\nout and seek a quiet place to pray and meditate.\r\n\r\n10  The Silence is the kingdom of the soul which is not seen by human\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n11  When in the Silence, phantom forms may flit before the mind; but\r\nthey are all subservient to the will; the master soul may speak and\r\nthey are gone.\r\n\r\n12  If you would find this Silence of the soul you must yourself\r\nprepare the way. None but the pure in heart may enter here.\r\n\r\n13  And you must lay aside all tenseness of the mind, all business\r\ncares, all fears, all doubts and troubled thoughts.\r\n\r\n14  Your human will must be absorbed by the divine; then you will come\r\ninto a consciousness of holiness.\r\n\r\n15  You are within the Holy Place, and you will see upon a living\r\nshrine the candle of the Lord aflame.\r\n\r\n16  And when you see it burning there, look deep within the temple of\r\nyour brain, and you will see it all aglow.\r\n\r\n17  In every part, from head to foot, are candles all in place, just\r\nwaiting to be lighted by the flaming torch of love.\r\n\r\n18  And when you see the candles all aflame, just look, and you will\r\nsee, with eyes of soul, the waters of the fount of wisdom rushing on;\r\nand you may drink, and there abide.\r\n\r\n19  And then the curtains part, and you are in the Holiest of All,\r\nwhere rests the Ark of God, whose covering is the Mercy Seat.\r\n\r\n20  Fear not to lift the sacred board; the Tables of the Law are in the\r\nArk concealed.\r\n\r\n21  Take them and read them well; for they contain all precepts and\r\ncommands that men will ever need.\r\n\r\n22  And in the Ark, the magic wand of prophecy lies waiting for your\r\nhand; it is the key to all the hidden meanings of the present, future,\r\npast.\r\n\r\n23  And then, behold, the manna there, the hidden bread of life; and he\r\nwho eats shall never die.\r\n\r\n24  The cherubim have guarded well for every soul this treasure box,\r\nand whosoever will may enter in and find his own.\r\n\r\n25  Now Kaspar heard the Hebrew master speak and he exclaimed, Behold,\r\nthe wisdom of the gods has come to men!\r\n\r\n26  And Jesus went his way, and in the sacred groves of Cyrus, where\r\nthe multitudes were met, he taught and healed the sick.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 41.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus stands by a healing fountain. Reveals the fact that\r\n      faith is the potent factor in healing and many are healed by\r\n      faith. A little child teaches a great lesson of faith._\r\n\r\nA flowing spring that people called the Healing Fount, was near\r\nPersepolis.\r\n\r\n2  And all the people thought that at a certain time of year their\r\ndeity came down and gave a virtue to the waters of the fount, and that\r\nthe sick who then would plunge into the fount and wash would be made\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\n3  About the fount a multitude of people were in waiting for the Holy\r\nOne to come and potentize the waters of the fount.\r\n\r\n4  The blind, the lame, the deaf, the dumb, and those obsessed were\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n5  And Jesus, standing in the midst of them, exclaimed, Behold the\r\nspring of life! These waters that will fail are honored as the special\r\nblessing of your God.\r\n\r\n6  From whence do healing virtues come? Why is your God so partial with\r\nhis gifts? Why does he bless this spring today, and then tomorrow take\r\nhis blessings all away?\r\n\r\n7  A deity of power could fill these waters full of healing virtue\r\nevery day.\r\n\r\n8  Hear me, you sick, disconsolate: The virtue of this fount is not a\r\nspecial gift of God.\r\n\r\n9  Faith is the healing power of every drop of all the waters of this\r\nspring.\r\n\r\n10  He who believes with all his heart that he will be made whole by\r\nwashing in this fount will be made whole when he has washed; and he\r\nmay wash at any time.\r\n\r\n11  Let every one who has this faith in God and in himself plunge in\r\nthese waters now and wash.\r\n\r\n12  And many of the people plunged into the crystal fount; and they\r\nwere healed.\r\n\r\n13  And then there was a rush, for all the people were inspired with\r\nfaith, and each one strove to be among the first to wash, lest all the\r\nvirtue be absorbed.\r\n\r\n14  And Jesus saw a little child, weak, faint and helpless, sitting all\r\nalone beyond the surging crowd; and there was none to help her to the\r\nfount.\r\n\r\n15  And Jesus said, My little one, why do you sit and wait? Why not\r\narise and hasten to the fount and wash, and be made well?\r\n\r\n16  The child replied, I need not haste; the blessings of my Father in\r\nthe sky are measured not in tiny cups; they never fail; their virtues\r\nare the same forevermore.\r\n\r\n17  When these whose faith is weak must haste to wash for fear their\r\nfaith will fail, have all been cured, these waters will be just as\r\npowerful for me.\r\n\r\n18  Then I can go and stay a long, long time within the blessed waters\r\nof the spring.\r\n\r\n19  And Jesus said, Behold a master soul! She came to earth to teach to\r\nmen the power of faith.\r\n\r\n20  And then he lifted up the child and said, Why wait for anything?\r\nThe very air we breathe is filled with balm of life. Breathe in this\r\nbalm of life in faith and be made whole.\r\n\r\n21  The child breathed in the balm of life in faith, and she was well.\r\n\r\n22  The people marveled much at what they heard and saw; they said,\r\nThis man must surely be the god of health made flesh.\r\n\r\n23  And Jesus said, The fount of life is not a little pool; it is as\r\nwide as are the spaces of the heavens.\r\n\r\n24  The waters of the fount are love; the potency is faith, and he who\r\nplunges deep into the living springs, in living faith, may wash away\r\nhis guilt and be made whole, and freed from sin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION IX.\r\n\r\nTETH.\r\n\r\n_Life and Works of Jesus in Assyria._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 42.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus bids the magians farewell. Goes to Assyria. Teaches the\r\n      people in Ur of Chaldea. Meets Ashbina, with whom he visits\r\n      many towns and cities, teaching and healing the sick._\r\n\r\nIn Persia Jesus’ work was done and he resumed his journey towards his\r\nnative land.\r\n\r\n2  The Persian sage went with him to the Euphrates; then with a pledge\r\nthat they would meet again in Egypt land the masters said, Farewell.\r\n\r\n3  And Kaspar went his way unto his home beside the Caspian Sea; and\r\nJesus soon was in Chaldea, cradle land of Israel.\r\n\r\n4  In Ur, where Abraham was born, he tarried for a time; and when he\r\ntold the people who he was, and why he came, they came from near and\r\nfar to speak to him.\r\n\r\n5  He said to them, We all are kin. Two thousand years and more ago,\r\nour Father Abraham lived here in Ur, and then he worshipped God the\r\nOne, and taught the people in these sacred groves.\r\n\r\n6  And he was greatly blessed; becoming father of the mighty hosts of\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n7  Although so many years have passed since Abraham and Sarah walked\r\nthese ways, a remnant of their kindred still abide in Ur.\r\n\r\n8  And in their hearts the God of Abraham is still adored, and faith\r\nand justice are the rocks on which they build.\r\n\r\n9  Behold this land! It is no more the fruitful land that Abraham loved\r\nso well; the rains come not as in the former times; the vine is not\r\nproductive now, and withered are the figs.\r\n\r\n10  But this shall not forever be; the time will come when all your\r\ndeserts will rejoice; when flowers will bloom; when all your vines\r\nwill bend their heads with luscious fruit; your shepherds will again\r\nbe glad.\r\n\r\n11  And Jesus preached to them the gospel of good will, and peace on\r\nearth. He told them of the brotherhood of life, and of the inborn\r\npowers of man, and of the kingdom of the soul.\r\n\r\n12  And as he spoke, Ashbina, greatest sage of all Assyria, stood\r\nbefore his face.\r\n\r\n13  The people knew the sage, for he had often taught them in their\r\nsacred halls and groves, and they rejoiced to see his face.\r\n\r\n14  Ashbina said, My children of Chaldea, hear! Behold, for you are\r\ngreatly blest today, because a prophet of the living God has come to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n15  Take heed to what this master says, for he gives forth the words\r\nthat God has given him.\r\n\r\n16  And Jesus and the sage went through the towns and cities of Chaldea\r\nand of the lands between the Tigris and the Euphrates;\r\n\r\n17  And Jesus healed a multitude of people who were sick.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 43.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus and Ashbina visit Babylon and remark its desolation.

His brothers are displeased. Jesus tells\r\n      his mother and aunt the story of his journeys._\r\n\r\nThe ruined Babylon was near, and Jesus and the sage went through her\r\ngates and walked among her fallen palaces.\r\n\r\n2  They trod the streets where Israel once was held in base captivity.\r\n\r\n3  They saw where Judah’s sons and daughters hung their harps upon the\r\nwillows, and refused to sing.\r\n\r\n4  They saw where Daniel and the Hebrew children stood as living\r\nwitnesses of faith.\r\n\r\n5  And Jesus lifted up his hands and said, Behold the grandeur of the\r\nworks of man!\r\n\r\n6  The king of Babylon destroyed the temple of the Lord in old\r\nJerusalem; he burned the holy city, bound in chains my people and my\r\nkin, and brought them here as slaves.\r\n\r\n7  But retribution comes; for whatsoever men shall do to other men the\r\nrighteous Judge will do to them.\r\n\r\n8  The sun of Babylon has gone down; the songs of pleasure will be\r\nheard no more within her walls.\r\n\r\n9  And every kind of creeping thing and unclean bird will, in these\r\nruins, find their homes.\r\n\r\n10  And in the temple Belus, Jesus and Ashbina stood in silent thought.\r\n\r\n11  Then Jesus spoke and said, Behold this monument of folly and of\r\nshame.\r\n\r\n12  Man tried to shake the very throne of God, and he assayed to build\r\na tower to reach to heaven, when, lo, his very speech was snatched\r\naway, because in lofty words he boasted of his power.\r\n\r\n13  And on these heights the heathen Baal stood--the god wrought out by\r\nhands of man.\r\n\r\n14  Upon yon altar, birds, and beasts, and men, yea children have been\r\nburned in awful sacrifice to Baal.\r\n\r\n15  But now the gory priests are dead; the very rocks have shuddered\r\nand have fallen down; the place is desolate.\r\n\r\n16  Now, in the plains of Shinar Jesus tarried yet for seven days, and,\r\nwith Ashbina, meditated long upon the needs of men, and how the sages\r\ncould best serve the coming age.\r\n\r\n17  Then Jesus went his way, and after many days he crossed the Jordan\r\nto his native land. At once he sought his home in Nazareth.\r\n\r\n18  His mother’s heart was filled with joy; she made a feast for him,\r\ninviting all her kindred and her friends.\r\n\r\n19  But Jesus’ brothers were not pleased that such attention should be\r\npaid to one they deemed a sheer adventurer, and they went not in to\r\nthe feast.\r\n\r\n20  They laughed their brother’s claims to scorn; they called him\r\nindolent, ambitious, vain; a worthless fortune hunter; searcher of the\r\nworld for fame, who, after many years returns to mother’s home with\r\nneither gold, nor any other wealth.\r\n\r\n21  And Jesus called aside his mother and her sister, Miriam, and told\r\nthem of his journey to the East.\r\n\r\n22  He told them of the lessons he had learned, and of the works that\r\nhe had done. To others he told not the story of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION X.\r\n\r\nJOD.\r\n\r\n_Life and Works of Jesus in Greece._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 44.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus visits Greece and is welcomed by the Athenians. Meets\r\n      Apollo. Addresses the Grecian masters in the Amphitheater.\r\n      The address._\r\n\r\nThe Greek philosophy was full of pungent truth, and Jesus longed to\r\nstudy with the masters in the schools of Greece.\r\n\r\n2  And so he left his home in Nazareth and crossed the Carmel hills,\r\nand at the port took ship, and soon was in the Grecian capital.\r\n\r\n3  Now, the Athenians had heard of him as teacher and philosopher, and\r\nthey were glad to have him come to them that they might hear his words\r\nof truth.\r\n\r\n4  Among the masters of the Greeks was one, Apollo, who was called,\r\nDefender of the Oracle, and recognized in many lands as Grecian sage.\r\n\r\n5  Apollo opened up for Jesus all the doors of Grecian lore, and in the\r\nAreopagus he heard the wisest masters speak.\r\n\r\n6  But Jesus brought to them a wisdom greater far than theirs; and so\r\nhe taught.\r\n\r\n7  Once in the Amphitheater he stood, and when Apollo bade him speak he\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n8  Athenian masters, hear! In ages long ago, men, wise in nature’s\r\nlaws, sought out and found the place on which your city stands.\r\n\r\n9  Full well you know that there are parts of earth where its great\r\nbeating heart throws heavenward etheric waves that meet the ethers\r\nfrom above;\r\n\r\n10  Where spirit-light and understanding, like the stars of night,\r\nshine forth.\r\n\r\n11  Of all the parts of earth there is no place more sensitized, more\r\ntruly spirit-blest, than that where Athens stands.\r\n\r\n12  Yea, all of Greece is blest. No other land has been the homeland of\r\nsuch mighty men of thought as grace your scrolls of fame.\r\n\r\n13  A host of sturdy giants of philosophy, of poetry, of science, and\r\nof art, were born upon the soil of Greece, and rocked to manhood in\r\nyour cradle of pure thought.\r\n\r\n14  I come not here to speak of science, of philosophy, or art; of\r\nthese you are the world’s best masters now.\r\n\r\n15  But all your high accomplishments are but stepping stones to worlds\r\nbeyond the realm of sense; are but illusive shadows flitting on the\r\nwalls of time.\r\n\r\n16  But I would tell you of a life beyond, within; a real life that can\r\nnot pass away.\r\n\r\n17  In science and philosophy there is no power strong enough to fit a\r\nsoul to recognize itself, or to commune with God.\r\n\r\n18  I would not stay the flow of your great streams of thought; but I\r\nwould turn them to the channels of the soul.\r\n\r\n19  Unaided by the Spirit-breath, the work of intellection tends to\r\nsolve the problems of the things we see, and nothing more.\r\n\r\n20  The senses were ordained to bring into the mind mere pictures of\r\nthe things that pass away; they do not deal with real things; they do\r\nnot comprehend eternal law.\r\n\r\n21  But man has something in his soul, a something that will tear the\r\nveil apart that he may see the world of real things.\r\n\r\n22  We call this something, spirit consciousness; it sleeps in every\r\nsoul, and cannot be awakened till the Holy Breath becomes a welcome\r\nguest.\r\n\r\n23  This Holy Breath knocks at the door of every soul, but cannot enter\r\nin until the will of man throws wide the door.\r\n\r\n24  There is no power in intellect to turn the key; philosophy and\r\nscience both have toiled to get a glimpse behind the veil; but they\r\nhave failed.\r\n\r\n25  The secret spring that throws ajar the door of soul is touched by\r\nnothing else than purity in life, by prayer and holy thought.\r\n\r\n26  Return, O mystic stream of Grecian thought, and mingle your\r\nclear waters with the flood of Spirit-life; and then the spirit\r\nconsciousness will sleep no more, and man will know, and God will\r\nbless.\r\n\r\n27  When Jesus had thus said he stepped aside. The Grecian masters were\r\nastonished at the wisdom of his words; they answered not.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 45.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus teaches the Greek masters. Goes with Apollo to Delphi\r\n      and hears the Oracle speak. It testifies for him. He abides\r\n      with Apollo, and is recognized as the Living Oracle of God.\r\n      Explains to Apollo the phenomenon of oracular speech._\r\n\r\nFor many days the Grecian masters listened to the clear incisive words\r\nthat Jesus spoke, and while they could not fully comprehend the things\r\nhe said, they were delighted and accepted his philosophy.\r\n\r\n2 One day as Jesus and Apollo walked beside the sea, a Delphic courier\r\ncame in haste and said, Apollo, master, come; the Oracle would speak\r\nwith you.\r\n\r\n3  Apollo said to Jesus, Sir, if you would see the Delphic Oracle, and\r\nhear it speak, you may accompany me. And Jesus did accompany him.\r\n\r\n4  The masters went in haste; and when they came to Delphi, great\r\nexcitement reigned.\r\n\r\n5  And when Apollo stood before the Oracle it spoke and said:\r\n\r\n6  Apollo, sage of Greece, the bell strikes twelve; the midnight of the\r\nages now has come.\r\n\r\n7  Within the womb of nature ages are conceived; they gestate and are\r\nborn in glory with the rising sun, and when the agic sun goes down the\r\nage disintegrates and dies.\r\n\r\n8  The Delphic age has been an age of glory and renown; the gods have\r\nspoken to the sons of men through oracles of wood, and gold, and\r\nprecious stone.\r\n\r\n9  The Delphic sun has set; the Oracle will go into decline; the time\r\nis near when men will hear its voice no more.\r\n\r\n10  The gods will speak to man by man. The Living Oracle now stands\r\nwithin these sacred groves; the Logos from on high has come.\r\n\r\n11  From henceforth will decrease my wisdom and my power; from\r\nhenceforth will increase the wisdom and the power of him, Immanuel.\r\n\r\n12  Let all the masters stay; let every creature hear and honor him,\r\nImmanuel.\r\n\r\n13  And then the Oracle spoke not again for forty days, and priests and\r\npeople were amazed. They came from near and far to hear the Living\r\nOracle speak forth the wisdom of the gods.\r\n\r\n14  And Jesus and the Grecian sage returned; and in Apollo’s home the\r\nLiving Oracle spoke forth for forty days.\r\n\r\n15  One day Apollo said to Jesus as they sat alone, This sacred Delphic\r\nOracle has spoken many a helpful word for Greece.\r\n\r\n16  Pray tell me what it is that speaks. Is it an angel, man, or living\r\ngod?\r\n\r\n17  And Jesus said, It is not angel, man, nor god that speaks. It is\r\nthe matchless wisdom of the master minds of Greece, united in a master\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n18  This giant mind has taken to itself the substances of soul, and\r\nthinks, and hears, and speaks.\r\n\r\n19  It will remain a living soul while master minds feed it with\r\nthought, with wisdom and with faith and hope.\r\n\r\n20  But when the master minds of Greece shall perish from the land,\r\nthis giant master mind will cease to be, and then the Delphic Oracle\r\nwill speak no more.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 46.\r\n\r\n    _A storm on the sea. Jesus rescues many drowning men. The\r\n      Athenians pray to idols. Jesus rebukes their idolatry and\r\n      tells how God helps. His last meeting with the Greeks. Sails\r\n      on the vessel Mars._\r\n\r\nIt was a holy day and Jesus walked upon the Athens’ beach.\r\n\r\n2  A storm was on and ships were being tossed about like toys upon the\r\nbosom of the sea.\r\n\r\n3  The sailors and the fishermen were going down to watery graves; the\r\nshores were strewn with bodies of the dead.\r\n\r\n4  And Jesus halted not, but with a mighty power he rescued many a\r\nhelpless one, oft bringing back to life the seeming dead.\r\n\r\n5  Now, on these shores were altars sacred to the gods supposed to rule\r\nthe seas.\r\n\r\n6  And men and women, heedless of the cries of drowning men, were\r\ncrowding all about these altars, calling on their gods for help.\r\n\r\n7  At length the storm was done, and all the sea was calm, and men\r\ncould think again; and Jesus said,\r\n\r\n8  You worshippers of wooden gods, how has the fury of this storm been\r\nlessened by your frantic prayers?\r\n\r\n9  Where is the strength of these poor, weather-beaten gods with\r\npainted swords and crowns?\r\n\r\n10  A god that could abide in such a little house could hardly hold a\r\nfrantic fly, and who could hope that he could hold at bay the Lords of\r\nwinds and waves?\r\n\r\n11  The mighty powers of worlds unseen do not give forth their help\r\ntill men have done their best; they only help when man can do no more.\r\n\r\n12  And you have agonized and prayed around these shrines, and let men\r\nsink to death who might have been, by your assistance, saved.\r\n\r\n13  The God that saves dwells in your souls, and manifests by making\r\nuse of your own feet, and legs, and arms, and hands.\r\n\r\n14  Strength never comes through idleness; nor through a waiting for\r\nanother one to bear your loads, or do the work that you are called to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n15  But when you do your best to bear your loads, and do your work, you\r\noffer unto God a sacrifice well-pleasing in his sight.\r\n\r\n16  And then the Holy One breathes deep upon your glowing sacrificial\r\ncoals, and makes them blaze aloft to fill your souls with light, and\r\nstrength and helpfulness.\r\n\r\n17  The most efficient prayer that men can offer to a god of any kind\r\nis helpfulness to those in need of help; for what you do for other men\r\nthe Holy One will do for you.\r\n\r\n18  And thus God helps.\r\n\r\n19  His work in Greece was done, and Jesus must go on his way to Egypt\r\nin the South. Apollo, with the highest masters of the land and many\r\npeople from the varied walks of life, stood on the shore to see the\r\nHebrew sage depart; and Jesus said,\r\n\r\n20  The son of man has been in many lands; has stood in temples of a\r\nmultitude of foreign gods; has preached the gospel of good will and\r\npeace on earth to many people, tribes and tongues;\r\n\r\n21  Has been received with favor in a multitude of homes; but Greece\r\nis, of them all, the royal host.\r\n\r\n22  The breadth of Grecian thought; the depth of her philosophy; the\r\nheight of her unselfish aspirations have well fitted her to be the\r\nchampion of the cause of human liberty and right.\r\n\r\n23  The fates of war have subjugated Greece, because she trusted in\r\nthe strength of flesh, and bone and intellect, forgetful of the\r\nspirit-life that binds a nation to its source of power,\r\n\r\n24  But Greece will not forever sit within the darkness of the\r\nshadowland as vassal of a foreign king.\r\n\r\n25  Lift up your heads, you men of Greece; the time will come when\r\nGreece will breathe the ethers of the Holy Breath, and be a main\r\nspring of the spirit power of earth.\r\n\r\n26  But God must be your shield, your buckler, and your tower of\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n27  And then he said, Farewell. Apollo raised his hand in silent\r\nbenediction, and the people wept.\r\n\r\n28  Upon the Cretan vessel, Mars, the Hebrew sage sailed from the\r\nGrecian port.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XI.\r\n\r\nCAPH.\r\n\r\n_Life and Works of Jesus in Egypt._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 47.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus with Elihu and Salome in Egypt. Tells the story of his\r\n      journeys. Elihu and Salome praise God. Jesus goes to the\r\n      temple in Heliopolis and is received as a pupil._\r\n\r\nAnd Jesus came to Egypt land, and all was well. He tarried not upon\r\nthe coast; he went at once to Zoan, home of Elihu and Salome, who five\r\nand twenty years before had taught his mother in their sacred school.\r\n\r\n2  And there was joy when met these three. When last the son of Mary\r\nsaw these sacred groves he was a babe;\r\n\r\n3  And now a man grown strong by buffetings of every kind; a teacher\r\nwho had stirred the multitudes in many lands.\r\n\r\n4  And Jesus told the aged teachers all about his life; about his\r\njourneyings in foreign lands; about the meetings with the masters and\r\nabout his kind receptions by the multitudes.\r\n\r\n5  Elihu and Salome heard his story with delight; they lifted up their\r\neyes to heaven and said,\r\n\r\n6  Our Father-God, let now thy servants go in peace, for we have seen\r\nthe glory of the Lord;\r\n\r\n7  And we have talked with him, the messenger of love, and of the\r\ncovenant of peace on earth, good will to men.\r\n\r\n8  Through him shall all the nations of the earth be blest; through\r\nhim, Immanuel.\r\n\r\n9  And Jesus staid in Zoan many days; and then went forth unto the city\r\nof the sun, that men call Heliopolis, and sought admission to the\r\ntemple of the sacred brotherhood.\r\n\r\n10  The council of the brotherhood convened, and Jesus stood before\r\nthe hierophant; he answered all the questions that were asked with\r\nclearness and with power.\r\n\r\n11  The hierophant exclaimed, Rabboni of the rabbinate, why come you\r\nhere? Your wisdom is the wisdom of the gods; why seek for wisdom in\r\nthe halls of men?\r\n\r\n12  And Jesus said, In every way of earth-life I would walk; in every\r\nhall of learning I would sit; the heights that any man has gained,\r\nthese I would gain;\r\n\r\n13  What any man has suffered I would meet, that I may know the\r\ngriefs, the disappointments and the sore temptations of my brother\r\nman; that I may know just how to succor those in need.\r\n\r\n14  I pray you, brothers, let me go into your dismal crypts; and I\r\nwould pass the hardest of your tests.\r\n\r\n15  The master said, Take then the vow of secret brotherhood. And Jesus\r\ntook the vow of secret brotherhood.\r\n\r\n16  Again the master spoke; he said, The greatest heights are gained by\r\nthose who reach the greatest depths; and you shall reach the greatest\r\ndepths.\r\n\r\n17  The guide then led the way and in the fountain Jesus bathed; and\r\nwhen he had been clothed in proper garb he stood again before the\r\nhierophant.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 48.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus receives from the hierophant his mystic name and number.\r\n      Passes the first brotherhood test, and receives his first\r\n      degree, SINCERITY._\r\n\r\nThe master took down from the wall a scroll on which was written down\r\nthe number and the name of every attribute and character. He said,\r\n\r\n2  The circle is the symbol of the perfect man, and seven is the number\r\nof the perfect man;\r\n\r\n3  The Logos is the perfect word; that which creates; that which\r\ndestroys, and that which saves.\r\n\r\n4  This Hebrew master is the Logos of the Holy One, the Circle of the\r\nhuman race, the Seven of time.\r\n\r\n5  And in the record book the scribe wrote down, The\r\nLogos-Circle-Seven; and thus was Jesus known.\r\n\r\n6  The master said, The Logos will give heed to what I say: No man can\r\nenter into light till he has found himself. Go forth and search till\r\nyou have found your soul and then return.\r\n\r\n7  The guide led Jesus to a room in which the light was faint and\r\nmellow, like the light of early dawn.\r\n\r\n8  The chamber walls were marked with mystic signs, with hieroglyphs\r\nand sacred texts; and in this chamber Jesus found himself alone where\r\nhe remained for many days.\r\n\r\n9  He read the sacred texts; thought out the meanings of the\r\nhieroglyphs and sought the import of the master’s charge to find\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n10  A revelation came; he got acquainted with his soul; he found\r\nhimself; then he was not alone.\r\n\r\n11  One night he slept and at the midnight hour, a door that he had not\r\nobserved, was opened, and a priest in somber garb came in and said,\r\n\r\n12  My brother, pardon me for coming in at this unseemly hour; but I\r\nhave come to save your life.\r\n\r\n13  You are the victim of a cruel plot. The priests of Heliopolis are\r\njealous of your fame, and they have said that you shall never leave\r\nthese gloomy crypts alive.\r\n\r\n14  The higher priests do not go forth to teach the world, and you are\r\ndoomed to temple servitude.\r\n\r\n15  Now, if you would be free, you must deceive these priests; must\r\ntell them you are here to stay for life;\r\n\r\n16  And then, when you have gained all that you wish to gain, I will\r\nreturn, and by a secret way will lead you forth that you may go in\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n17  And Jesus said, My brother, man, would you come here to teach\r\ndeceit? Am I within these holy walls to learn the wiles of vile\r\nhypocrisy?\r\n\r\n18  Nay, man, my Father scorns deceit, and I am here to do his will.\r\n\r\n19  Deceive these priests! Not while the sun shall shine. What I have\r\nsaid, that I have said; I will be true to them, to God, and to myself.\r\n\r\n20  And then the tempter left, and Jesus was again alone; but in a\r\nlittle time a white-robed priest appeared and said,\r\n\r\n21  Well done! the Logos has prevailed. This is the trial chamber\r\nof hypocrisy. And then he led the way, and Jesus stood before the\r\njudgment seat.\r\n\r\n22  And all the brothers stood; the hierophant came forth and laid his\r\nhand on Jesus’ head, and placed within his hands a scroll, on which\r\nwas written just one word, SINCERITY; and not a word was said.\r\n\r\n23  The guide again appeared, and led the way, and in a spacious room\r\nreplete with everything a student craves was Jesus bade to rest and\r\nwait.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 49.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus passes the second brotherhood test, and receives the\r\n      second degree, JUSTICE._\r\n\r\nThe Logos did not care to rest; he said, Why wait in this luxurious\r\nroom? I need not rest; my Father’s work upon me presses hard.\r\n\r\n2  I would go on and learn my lessons all. If there are trials, let\r\nthem come, for every victory over self gives added strength.\r\n\r\n3  And then the guide led on, and in a chamber, dark as night, was\r\nJesus placed and left alone; and days were spent in this deep solitude.\r\n\r\n4  And Jesus slept, and in the dead of night a secret door was opened,\r\nand, in priest’s attire, two men came in; each carried in his hand a\r\nlittle flickering lamp.\r\n\r\n5  Approaching Jesus, one spoke out and said, Young man, our hearts are\r\ngrieved because of what you suffer in these fearful dens, and we have\r\ncome as friends to bring you light, and show the way to liberty.\r\n\r\n6  We once, like you, were in these dens confined, and thought that\r\nthrough these weird, uncanny ways we could attain to blessedness and\r\npower;\r\n\r\n7  But in a luckful moment we were undeceived, and, making use of all\r\nour strength, we broke our chains, and then we learned that all this\r\nservice is corruption in disguise. These priests are criminals just\r\nhid away.\r\n\r\n8  They boast in sacrificial rites; they offer to their gods, and burn\r\nthem while alive, poor birds, and beasts; yea, children, women, men.\r\n\r\n9  And now they keep you here, and, at a certain time, may offer you in\r\nsacrifice.\r\n\r\n10  We pray you, brother, break your chains; come, go with us; accept\r\nof freedom while you may.\r\n\r\n11  And Jesus said, Your little tapers show the light you bring. Pray,\r\nwho are you? The words of man are worth no more than is the man\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n12  These temple walls are strong and high; how gained you entrance to\r\nthis place?\r\n\r\n13  The men replied, Beneath these walls are many hidden ways, and we\r\nwho have been priests, spent months and years within these dens, know\r\nall of them.\r\n\r\n14  Then you are traitors, Jesus said. A traitor is a fiend; he who\r\nbetrays another man is never man to trust.\r\n\r\n15  If one has only reached the plane of treachery, he is a lover of\r\ndeceit, and will betray a friend to serve his selfish self.\r\n\r\n16  Behold, you men, or whatsoe’er you be, your words fall lightly on\r\nmy ears,\r\n\r\n17  Could I prejudge these hundred priests, turn traitor to myself and\r\nthem, because of what you say when you confess your treachery?\r\n\r\n18  No man can judge for me; and if I judge till testimony all is in I\r\nmight not judge aright.\r\n\r\n19  Nay, men; by whatsoever way you came, return. My soul prefers the\r\ndarkness of the grave to little flickering lights like these you bring.\r\n\r\n20  My conscience rules; what these, my brothers, have to say I’ll\r\nhear, and when the testimony all is in I will decide. You cannot judge\r\nfor me, nor I for you,\r\n\r\n21  Begone, you men, begone, and leave me to this charming light; for\r\nwhile the sun shines not, within my soul there is a light surpassing\r\nthat of sun or moon.\r\n\r\n22  Then, with an angry threat that they would do him harm, the wily\r\ntempters left, and Jesus was again alone.\r\n\r\n23  Again the white-robed priest appeared, and led the way, and Jesus\r\nstood again before the hierophant;\r\n\r\n24  And not a word was said, but in his hands the master placed a\r\nscroll on which the word suggestive, JUSTICE, was inscribed.\r\n\r\n25  And Jesus was the master of the phantom forms of prejudice and of\r\ntreachery.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 50.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus passes the third brotherhood test, and receives the\r\n      third degree, FAITH._\r\n\r\nThe Logos waited seven days, and then was taken to the Hall of Fame, a\r\nchamber rich in furnishings, and lighted up with gold and silver lamps.\r\n\r\n2  The colors of its ceilings, decorations, furnishings and walls were\r\nblue and gold.\r\n\r\n3  Its shelves were filled with books of master minds; the paintings\r\nand the statues were the works of highest art.\r\n\r\n4  And Jesus was entranced with all this elegance and these manifests\r\nof thought. He read the sacred books, and sought the meanings of the\r\nsymbols and the hieroglyphs.\r\n\r\n5  And when he was absorbed in deepest thought, a priest approached and\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n6  Behold the glory of this place! my brother you are highly blest. Few\r\nmen of earth, so young, have reached such heights of fame.\r\n\r\n7  Now, if you do not waste your life in search for hidden things that\r\nmen can never comprehend, you may be founder of a school of thought\r\nthat will insure you endless fame;\r\n\r\n8  For your philosophy is deeper far than that of Plato, and your\r\nteachings please the common people more than those of Socrates.\r\n\r\n9  Why seek for mystic light within these antiquated dens? Go forth and\r\nwalk with men, and think with men, and they will honor you.\r\n\r\n10  And, after all, these weird initiations may be myths, and your\r\nMessiah hopes but base illusions of the hour.\r\n\r\n11  I would advise you to renounce uncertain things and choose the\r\ncourse that leads to certain fame.\r\n\r\n12  And thus the priest, a demon in disguise, sung syren songs of\r\nunbelief; and Jesus meditated long and well on what he said.\r\n\r\n13  The conflict was a bitter one, for king Ambition is a sturdy foe to\r\nfight.\r\n\r\n14  For forty days the higher wrestled with the lower self, and then\r\nthe fight was won.\r\n\r\n15  Faith rose triumphant; unbelief was not. Ambition covered up his\r\nface and fled away, and Jesus said,\r\n\r\n16  The wealth, the honor, and the fame of earth are but the baubles of\r\nan hour.\r\n\r\n17  When this short span of earthly life has all been measured out,\r\nman’s bursting baubles will be buried with his bones.\r\n\r\n18  Yea, what a man does for his selfish self will make no markings on\r\nthe credit side of life.\r\n\r\n19  The good that men for other men shall do becomes a ladder strong on\r\nwhich the soul may climb to wealth, and power and fame of God’s own\r\nkind, that cannot pass away,\r\n\r\n20  Give me the poverty of men, the consciousness of duty done in love,\r\nthe approbation of my God, and I will be content.\r\n\r\n21  And then he lifted up his eyes to heaven and said,\r\n\r\n22  My Father-God, I thank thee for this hour. I ask not for the glory\r\nof thyself; I fain would be a keeper of thy temple gates, and serve my\r\nbrother man.\r\n\r\n23  Again was Jesus called to stand before the hierophant; again no\r\nword was said, but in his hands the master placed a scroll on which\r\nwas written FAITH.\r\n\r\n24  And Jesus bowed his head in humble thanks; then went his way.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 51.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus passes the fourth brotherhood test, and receives the\r\n      fourth degree, PHILANTHROPY._\r\n\r\nWhen other certain days had passed, the guide led Jesus to the Hall of\r\nMirth, a hall most richly furnished, and replete with every thing a\r\ncarnal heart could wish.\r\n\r\n2  The choicest viands and the most delicious wines were on the boards;\r\nand maids, in gay attire, served all with grace and cheerfulness.\r\n\r\n3  And men and women, richly clad, were there; and they were wild with\r\njoy; they sipped from every cup of mirth.\r\n\r\n4  And Jesus watched the happy throng in silence for a time, and then a\r\nman in garb of sage came up and said, Most happy is the man who, like\r\nthe bee, can gather sweets from every flower.\r\n\r\n5  The wise man is the one who seeks for pleasure, and can find it\r\neverywhere,\r\n\r\n6  At best man’s span of life on earth is short, and then he dies and\r\ngoes, he knows not where.\r\n\r\n7  Then let us eat, and drink, and dance, and sing, and get the joys of\r\nlife, for death comes on apace.\r\n\r\n8  It is but foolishness to spend a life for other men. Behold, all die\r\nand lie together in the grave, where none can know and none can show\r\nforth gratitude.\r\n\r\n9  But Jesus answered not; upon the tinseled guests in all their rounds\r\nof mirth he gazed in silent thought.\r\n\r\n10  And then among the guests he saw a man whose clothes were coarse;\r\nwho showed in face and hands the lines of toil and want.\r\n\r\n11 The giddy throng found pleasure in abusing him; they jostled him\r\nagainst the wall, and laughed at his discomfiture.\r\n\r\n12  And then a poor, frail woman came, who carried in her face and form\r\nthe marks of sin and shame; and without mercy she was spit upon, and\r\njeered, and driven from the hall.\r\n\r\n13  And then a little child, with timid ways and hungry mien, came in\r\nand asked for just a morsel of their food.\r\n\r\n14  But she was driven out uncared for and unloved; and still the merry\r\ndance went on.\r\n\r\n15  And when the pleasure seekers urged that Jesus join them in their\r\nmirth, he said,\r\n\r\n16  How could I seek for pleasure for myself while others are in want?\r\nHow can you think that while the children cry for bread, while those\r\nin haunts of sin call out for sympathy and love that I can fill myself\r\nto full with the good things of life?\r\n\r\n17  I tell you, nay; we all are kin, each one a part of the great human\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n18  I cannot see myself apart from that poor man that you so scorned,\r\nand crowded to the wall;\r\n\r\n19  Nor from the one in female garb who came up from the haunts of vice\r\nto ask for sympathy and love, who was by you so ruthlessly pushed back\r\ninto her den of sin;\r\n\r\n20  Nor from that little child that you drove from your midst to suffer\r\nin the cold, bleak winds of night.\r\n\r\n21  I tell you, men, what you have done to these, my kindred, you have\r\ndone to me.\r\n\r\n22  You have insulted me in your own home; I cannot stay. I will go\r\nforth and find that child, that woman and that man, and give them help\r\nuntil my life’s blood all has ebbed away.\r\n\r\n23  I call it pleasure when I help the helpless, feed the hungry,\r\nclothe the naked, heal the sick, and speak good words of cheer to\r\nthose unloved, discouraged and depressed.\r\n\r\n24  And this that you call mirth is but a phantom of the night; but\r\nflashes of the fire of passion, painting pictures on the walls of time.\r\n\r\n25  And while the Logos spoke the white-robed priest came in and said\r\nto him, The council waits for you.\r\n\r\n26  Then Jesus stood again before the bar; again no word was said;\r\nthe hierophant placed in his hands a scroll, on which was writ,\r\nPHILANTHROPY.\r\n\r\n27  And Jesus was a victor over selfish self.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 52.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus spends forty days in the temple groves. Passes the fifth\r\n      brotherhood test and receives the fifth degree, HEROISM._\r\n\r\nThe sacred temple groves were rich in statues, monuments and shrines;\r\nhere Jesus loved to walk and meditate.\r\n\r\n2  And after he had conquered self he talked with nature in these\r\ngroves for forty days.\r\n\r\n3  And then the guide took chains and bound him hand and foot; and then\r\ncast him into a den of hungry beasts, of unclean birds, and creeping\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n4  The den was dark as night; the wild beasts howled; the birds in fury\r\nscreamed; the reptiles hissed.\r\n\r\n5  And Jesus said, Who was it that did bind me thus? Why did I meekly\r\nsit to be bound down with chains?\r\n\r\n6  I tell you, none has power to bind a human soul. Of what are fetters\r\nmade?\r\n\r\n7  And in his might he rose, and what he thought were chains were only\r\nworthless cords that parted at his touch.\r\n\r\n8  And then he laughed and said, The chains that bind men to the\r\ncarcasses of earth are forged in fancy’s shop; are made of air, and\r\nwelded in illusion’s fires.\r\n\r\n9  If man will stand erect, and use the power of will, his chains will\r\nfall, like worthless rags; for will and faith are stronger than the\r\nstoutest chains that men have ever made.\r\n\r\n10  And Jesus stood erect among the hungry beasts, and birds, and said,\r\nWhat is this darkness that envelops me?\r\n\r\n11  ’Tis but the absence of the light. And what is light? ’Tis but the\r\nbreath of God vibrating in the rythm of rapid thought.\r\n\r\n12  And then he said, Let there be light; and with a mighty will he\r\nstirred the ethers up, and their vibrations reached the plane of\r\nlight; and there was light.\r\n\r\n13  The darkness of that den of night became the brightness of a\r\nnewborn day.\r\n\r\n14  And then he looked to see the beasts, and birds, and creeping\r\nthings; lo, they were not.\r\n\r\n15  And Jesus said, Of what are souls afraid? Fear is the chariot in\r\nwhich man rides to death;\r\n\r\n16  And when he finds himself within the chamber of the dead, he learns\r\nthat he has been deceived; his chariot was a myth, and death a fancy\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n17  But some day all man’s lessons will be learned, and from the den of\r\nunclean, beasts and birds, and creeping things he will arise to walk\r\nin light.\r\n\r\n18  And Jesus saw a ladder made of gold, on which he climbed, and at\r\nthe top the white-robed priest awaited him.\r\n\r\n19  Again he stood before the council bar; again no word was said;\r\nagain the hierophant reached forth his hand to bless.\r\n\r\n20  He placed in Jesus’ hand another scroll, and on this one was\r\nwritten, HEROISM.\r\n\r\n21  The Logos had encountered fear and all his phantom host, and in the\r\nconflict he achieved the victory.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 53.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus passes the sixth brotherhood test and receives the sixth\r\n      degree, LOVE DIVINE._\r\n\r\nIn all the land there was no place more grandly furnished than the\r\nBeauty Parlors of the temple of the sun.\r\n\r\n2  Few students ever entered these rich rooms; the priests regarded\r\nthem with awe, and called them Halls of Mysteries.\r\n\r\n3  When Jesus had attained the victory over fear, he gained the right\r\nto enter here.\r\n\r\n4  The guide led on the way, and after passing many richly furnished\r\nrooms they reached the Hall of Harmony; and here was Jesus left alone.\r\n\r\n5  Among the instruments of music was a harpsichord, and Jesus sat in\r\nthoughtful mood inspecting it, when, quietly, a maiden of entrancing\r\nbeauty came into the hall.\r\n\r\n6  She did not seem to notice Jesus as he sat and mused, so busy with\r\nhis thoughts.\r\n\r\n7  She found her place beside the harpsichord; she touched the chords\r\nmost gently, and she sung the songs of Israel.\r\n\r\n8  And Jesus was entranced; such beauty he had never seen; such music\r\nhe had never heard.\r\n\r\n9  The maiden sung her songs; she did not seem to know that any one was\r\nnear; she went her way\r\n\r\n10  And Jesus, talking with himself, said out, What is the meaning of\r\nthis incident? I did not know that such entrancing beauty and such\r\nqueen-like loveliness were ever found among the sons of men.\r\n\r\n11  I did not know that voice of angel ever graced a human form, or\r\nthat seraphic music ever came from human lips.\r\n\r\n12  For days he sat entranced; the current of his thoughts was changed;\r\nhe thought of nothing but the singer and her songs.\r\n\r\n13  He longed to see her once again; and after certain days she came;\r\nshe spoke and laid her hand upon his head.\r\n\r\n14  Her touch thrilled all his soul, and for the time, forgotten was\r\nthe work that he was sent to do.\r\n\r\n15  Few were the words the maiden said; she went her way; but then the\r\nheart of Jesus had been touched.\r\n\r\n16  A love-flame had been kindled in his soul, and he was brought to\r\nface the sorest trial of his life.\r\n\r\n17  He could not sleep nor eat. Thoughts of the maiden came; they would\r\nnot go. His carnal nature called aloud for her companionship.\r\n\r\n18  And then he said, Lo, I have conquered every foe that I have met,\r\nand shall I now be conquered by this carnal love?\r\n\r\n19  My Father sent me here to show the power of love divine, that love\r\nthat reaches every living thing.\r\n\r\n20  Shall this pure, universal love be all absorbed by carnal love?\r\nShall I forget all creatures else, and lose my life in this fair\r\nmaiden, though she is the highest type of beauty, purity and love?\r\n\r\n21  Into its very depths his soul was stirred, and long he wrestled\r\nwith this angel-idol of his heart.\r\n\r\n22  But when the day was almost lost, his higher ego rose in might; he\r\nfound himself again, and then he said,\r\n\r\n23  Although my heart shall break I will not fail in this my hardest\r\ntask; I will be victor over carnal love.\r\n\r\n24  And when again the maiden came, and offered him her hand and heart,\r\nhe said,\r\n\r\n25  Fair one, your very presence thrills me with delight; your voice\r\nis benediction to my soul; my human self would fly with you, and be\r\ncontented in your love;\r\n\r\n26  But all the world is craving for a love that I have come to\r\nmanifest.\r\n\r\n27  I must, then, bid you go; but we will meet again; our ways on earth\r\nwill not be cast apart.\r\n\r\n28  I see you in the hurrying throngs of earth as minister of love; I\r\nhear your voice in song, that wins the hearts of men to better things.\r\n\r\n29  And then in sorrow and in tears the maiden went away, and Jesus was\r\nagain alone.\r\n\r\n30  And instantly the great bells of the temple rang; the singers sung\r\na new, new song; the grotto blazed with light.\r\n\r\n31  The hierophant himself appeared, and said, All hail! triumphant\r\nLogos, hail! The conqueror of carnal love stands on the heights.\r\n\r\n32  And then he placed in Jesus’ hands a scroll on which was written\r\nLOVE DIVINE.\r\n\r\n33  Together they passed from the grotto of the beautiful, and in the\r\nbanquet hall a feast was served, and Jesus was the honored guest.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 54.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus becomes a private pupil of the hierophant and is taught\r\n      the mysteries of Egypt. In passing the seventh test, he works\r\n      in the Chamber of the Dead._\r\n\r\nThe senior course of study now was opened up and Jesus entered and\r\nbecame a pupil of the hierophant.\r\n\r\n2  He learned the secrets of the mystic lore of Egypt land; the\r\nmysteries of life and death and of the worlds beyond the circle of the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\n3  When he had finished all the studies of the senior course, he went\r\ninto the Chamber of the Dead, that he might learn the ancient methods\r\nof preserving from decay the bodies of the dead; and here he wrought.\r\n\r\n4  And carriers brought the body of a widow’s only son to be embalmed;\r\nthe weeping mother followed close; her grief was great.\r\n\r\n5  And Jesus said, Good woman, dry your tears; you follow but an empty\r\nhouse; your son is in it not.\r\n\r\n6  You weep because your son is dead. Death is a cruel word; your son\r\ncan never die.\r\n\r\n7  He had a task assigned to do in garb of flesh; he came; he did his\r\nwork, and then he laid the flesh aside; he did not need it more.\r\n\r\n8  Beyond your human sight he has another work to do, and he will do it\r\nwell, and then pass on to other tasks, and, by and by, he will attain\r\nthe crown of perfect life.\r\n\r\n9  And what your son has done, and what he yet must do, we all must do.\r\n\r\n10  Now, if you harbor grief, and give your sorrows vent they will grow\r\ngreater every day. They will absorb your very life until at last you\r\nwill be naught but grief, wet down with bitter tears.\r\n\r\n11  Instead of helping him you grieve your son by your deep grief. He\r\nseeks your solace now as he has ever done; is glad when you are glad;\r\nis saddened when you grieve.\r\n\r\n12  Go bury deep your woes, and smile at grief, and lose yourself in\r\nhelping others dry their tears.\r\n\r\n13  With duty done comes happiness and joy; and gladness cheers the\r\nhearts of those who have passed on.\r\n\r\n14  The weeping woman turned, and went her way to find a happiness in\r\nhelpfulness; to bury deep her sorrows in a ministry of joy.\r\n\r\n15  Then other carriers came and brought the body of a mother to the\r\nChamber of the Dead; and just one mourner followed; she a girl of\r\ntender years.\r\n\r\n16  And as the cortege neared the door, the child observed a wounded\r\nbird in sore distress; a cruel hunter’s dart had pierced its breast.\r\n\r\n17  And she left following the dead, and went to help the living bird.\r\n\r\n18  With tenderness and love she folded to her breast the wounded bird;\r\nthen hurried to her place.\r\n\r\n19  And Jesus said to her, Why did you leave your dead to save a\r\nwounded bird?\r\n\r\n20  The maiden said, This lifeless body needs no help from me; but I\r\ncan help while yet life is; my mother taught me this.\r\n\r\n21  My mother taught that grief and selfish love, and hopes and fears\r\nare but reflexes from the lower self;\r\n\r\n22  That what we sense are but small waves upon the rolling billows of\r\na life.\r\n\r\n23  These all will pass away; they are unreal.\r\n\r\n24  Tears flow from hearts of flesh; the spirit never weeps; and I am\r\nlonging for the day when I will walk in light, where tears are wiped\r\naway.\r\n\r\n25  My mother taught that all emotions are the sprays that rise from\r\nhuman loves, and hopes, and fears; that perfect bliss cannot be ours\r\ntill we have conquered these.\r\n\r\n26  And in the presence of that child did Jesus bow his head in\r\nreverence. He said,\r\n\r\n27  For days and months and years I’ve sought to learn this highest\r\ntruth that man can learn on earth, and here a child, fresh brought to\r\nearth, has told it all in one short breath.\r\n\r\n28  No wonder David said, O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name\r\nin all the earth!\r\n\r\n29  Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n30  And then he laid his hand upon the maiden’s head, and said, I’m\r\nsure the blessings of my Father-God will rest upon you, child,\r\nforevermore.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 55.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus passes the seventh brotherhood test, and in the purple\r\n      room of the temple receives the seventh, the highest degree,\r\n      THE CHRIST. He leaves the temple a conqueror._\r\n\r\nThe work of Jesus in the Chamber of the Dead was done, and in the\r\ntemple purple room he stood before the hierophant.\r\n\r\n2  And he was clothed in purple robes; and all the brothers stood. The\r\nhierophant arose and said,\r\n\r\n3  This is a royal day for all the hosts of Israel. In honor of their\r\nchosen son we celebrate the great Passover Feast.\r\n\r\n4  And then he said to Jesus, Brother, man, most excellent of men, in\r\nall the temple tests you have won out.\r\n\r\n5  Six times before the bar of right you have been judged; six times\r\nyou have received the highest honors man can give; and now you stand\r\nprepared to take the last degree.\r\n\r\n6  Upon your brow I place this diadem, and in the Great Lodge of the\r\nheavens and earth you are THE CHRIST.\r\n\r\n7  This is your great Passover rite. You are a neophyte no more; but\r\nnow a master mind.\r\n\r\n8  Now, man can do no more; but God himself will speak, and will\r\nconfirm your title and degree.\r\n\r\n9  Go on your way, for you must preach the gospel of good will to men\r\nand peace on earth; must open up the prison doors and set the captives\r\nfree.\r\n\r\n10  And while the hierophant yet spoke the temple bells rang out; a\r\npure white dove descended from above and sat on Jesus’ head.\r\n\r\n11  And then a voice that shook the very temple said, THIS IS THE\r\nCHRIST; and every living creature said, AMEN.\r\n\r\n12  The great doors of the temple swung ajar; the Logos journeyed on\r\nhis way a conqueror.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XII.\r\n\r\nLAMED.\r\n\r\n_The Council of the Seven Sages of the World._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 56.\r\n\r\n    _The seven sages of the world meet in Alexandria. The purposes\r\n      of the meeting. The opening addresses._\r\n\r\nIn every age since time began have seven sages lived.\r\n\r\n2  At first of every age these sages meet to note the course of\r\nnations, peoples, tribes and tongues;\r\n\r\n3  To note how far toward justice, love and righteousness the race has\r\ngone;\r\n\r\n4  To formulate the code of laws, religious postulates and plans of\r\nrule best suited to the coming age.\r\n\r\n5  An age had passed, and, lo, another age had come; the sages must\r\nconvene.\r\n\r\n6  Now, Alexandria was the center of the world’s best thought, and here\r\nin Philo’s home the sages met.\r\n\r\n7  From China came Meng-ste; from India Vidyapati came; from Persia\r\nKaspar came; and from Assyria Ashbina came; from Greece Apollo came;\r\nMatheno was the Egyptian sage, and Philo was the chief of Hebrew\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n8  The time was due; the council met and sat in silence seven days.\r\n\r\n9  And then Meng-ste arose and said, The wheel of time has turned once\r\nmore; the race is on a higher plane of thought.\r\n\r\n10  The garments that our fathers wove have given out; the cherubim\r\nhave woven a celestial cloth; have placed it in our hands and we must\r\nmake for men new garbs.\r\n\r\n11  The sons of men are looking up for greater light. No longer do they\r\ncare for gods hewn out of wood, or made of clay. They seek a God not\r\nmade with hands.\r\n\r\n12  They see the beams of coming day, and yet they comprehend them not.\r\n\r\n13  The time is ripe, and we must fashion well these garments for the\r\nrace.\r\n\r\n14  And let us make for men new garbs of justice, mercy, righteousness\r\nand love, that they may hide their nakedness when shines the light of\r\ncoming day.\r\n\r\n15  And Vidyapati said, Our priests have all gone mad; they saw a demon\r\nin the wilds and at him cast their lamps and they are broken up, and\r\nnot a gleam of light has any priest for men.\r\n\r\n16  The night is dark; the heart of India calls for light.\r\n\r\n17  The priesthood cannot be reformed; it is already dead; its greatest\r\nneeds are graves and funeral chants.\r\n\r\n18  The new age calls for liberty; the kind that makes each man a\r\npriest, enables him to go alone, and lay his offerings on the shrine\r\nof God.\r\n\r\n19  And Kaspar said, In Persia people walk in fear; they do the good\r\nfor fear to do the wrong.\r\n\r\n20  The devil is the greatest power in our land, and though a myth, he\r\ndandles on his knee both youth and age.\r\n\r\n21  Our land is dark, and evil prospers in the dark.\r\n\r\n22  Fear rides on every passing breeze, and lurks in every form of life.\r\n\r\n23  The fear of evil is a myth, is an illusion and a snare; but it\r\nwill live until some mighty power shall come to raise the ethers to\r\nthe plane of light.\r\n\r\n24  When this shall come to pass the magian land will glory in the\r\nlight. The soul of Persia calls for light.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 57.\r\n\r\n    _Meeting of the sages, continued. Opening addresses. Jesus with\r\n      the sages. Seven days’ silence._\r\n\r\nAshbina said, Assyria is the land of doubt; the chariot of my people,\r\nthat in which they mostly ride, is labeled Doubt.\r\n\r\n2  Once Faith walked forth in Babylon; and she was bright and fair; but\r\nshe was clothed in such white robes that men became afraid of her.\r\n\r\n3  And every wheel began to turn, and Doubt made war on her, and drove\r\nher from the land; and she came back no more.\r\n\r\n4  In form men worship God, the One; in heart they are not sure that\r\nGod exists.\r\n\r\n5  Faith worships at the shrine of one not seen; but Doubt must see her\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n6  The greatest need of all Assyria is faith--a faith that seasons\r\nevery thing that is, with certainty.\r\n\r\n7  And then Apollo said, The greatest needs of Greece are true concepts\r\nof God.\r\n\r\n8  Theogony in Greece is rudderless, for every thought may be a god,\r\nand worshipped as a god.\r\n\r\n9  The plane of thought is broad, and full of sharp antagonists; and\r\nso the circle of the gods is filled with enmity, with wars and base\r\nintrigues.\r\n\r\n10  Greece needs a master mind to stand above the gods; to raise the\r\nthoughts of men away from many gods to God the One.\r\n\r\n11  We know that light is coming o’er the hills. God speed the light.\r\n\r\n12  Matheno said, Behold this land of mystery! this Egypt of the dead!\r\n\r\n13  Our temples long have been the tombs of all the hidden things of\r\ntime; our temples, crypts and caves are dark.\r\n\r\n14  In light there are no secret things. The sun reveals all hidden\r\ntruth. There are no mysteries in God.\r\n\r\n15  Behold the rising sun! His beams are entering every door; yea,\r\nevery crevice of the mystic crypts of Mizraim.\r\n\r\n16  We hail the light! All Egypt craves the light.\r\n\r\n17  And Philo said, The need of Hebrew thought and life is liberty.\r\n\r\n18  The Hebrew prophets, seers, and givers of the law, were men of\r\npower, men of holy thought, and they bequeathed to us a system of\r\nphilosophy that was ideal; one strong enough and good enough to lead\r\nour people to the goal of perfectness.\r\n\r\n19  But carnal minds repudiated holiness; a priesthood filled with\r\nselfishness arose, and purity in heart became a myth; the people were\r\nenslaved.\r\n\r\n20  The priesthood is the curse of Israel; but when he comes, who is to\r\ncome, he will proclaim emancipation for the slaves; my people will be\r\nfree.\r\n\r\n21  Behold, for God has made incarnate wisdom, love and light, which he\r\nhas called Immanuel.\r\n\r\n22  To him is given the keys to open up the dawn; and here, as man, he\r\nwalks with us.\r\n\r\n23  And then the council chamber door was opened and the Logos stood\r\namong the sages of the world.\r\n\r\n24  Again the sages sat in silence seven days.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 58.\r\n\r\n    _Meeting of the sages, continued. Presentation of the seven\r\n      universal postulates._\r\n\r\nNow, when the sages were refreshed they opened up the Book of Life and\r\nread.\r\n\r\n2  They read the story of the life of man; of all his struggles,\r\nlosses, gains; and in the light of past events and needs, they saw\r\nwhat would be best for him in coming years.\r\n\r\n3  They knew the kind of laws and precepts suited best to his estate;\r\nthey saw the highest God-ideal that the race could comprehend.\r\n\r\n4  Upon the seven postulates these sages were to formulate, the great\r\nphilosophy of life and worship of the coming age must rest.\r\n\r\n5  Now Meng-ste was the oldest sage; he took the chair of chief, and\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n6  Man is not far enough advanced to live by faith; he cannot\r\ncomprehend the things his eyes see not,\r\n\r\n7  He yet is child, and during all the coming age he must be taught by\r\npictures, symbols, rites, and forms.\r\n\r\n8  His God must be a human God; he cannot see a God by faith.\r\n\r\n9  And then he cannot rule himself; the king must rule; the man must\r\nserve.\r\n\r\n10  The age that follows this will be the age of man, the age of faith.\r\n\r\n11  In that blest age the human race will see without the aid of carnal\r\neyes; will hear the soundless sound; will know the Spirit-God.\r\n\r\n12  The age we enter is the Preparation age, and all the schools, and\r\ngovernments and worship rites must be designed in simple way that men\r\nmay comprehend.\r\n\r\n13  And man cannot originate; he builds by patterns that he sees; so in\r\nthis council we must carve out pattern for the coming age.\r\n\r\n14  And we must formulate the gnosis of the Empire of the soul, which\r\nrests on seven postulates.\r\n\r\n15  Each sage in turn shall form a postulate; and these shall be the\r\nbasis of the creeds of men until the perfect age shall come.\r\n\r\n16  Then Meng-ste wrote the first:\r\n\r\n17  All things are thought; all life is thought activity. The multitude\r\nof beings are but phases of the one great thought made manifest. Lo,\r\nGod is Thought, and Thought is God.\r\n\r\n18  Then Vidyapati wrote the second postulate:\r\n\r\n19  Eternal Thought is one; in essence it is two--Intelligence and\r\nForce; and when they breathe a child is born; this child is Love.\r\n\r\n20  And thus the Triune God stands forth, whom men call\r\nFather-Mother-Child.\r\n\r\n21  This Triune God is one; but like the one of light, in essence he is\r\nseven.\r\n\r\n22  And when the Triune God breathes forth, lo, seven Spirits stand\r\nbefore his face; these are creative attributes.\r\n\r\n23  Men call them lesser gods, and in their image they made man.\r\n\r\n24  And Kaspar wrote the third:\r\n\r\n25  Man was a thought of God, formed in the image of the Septonate,\r\nclothed in the substances of soul.\r\n\r\n26  And his desires were strong; he sought to manifest on every plane\r\nof life, and for himself he made a body of the ethers of the earthy\r\nforms, and so descended to the plane of earth.\r\n\r\n27  In this descent he lost his birthright; lost his harmony with God,\r\nand made discordant all the notes of life.\r\n\r\n28  Inharmony and evil are the same; so evil is the handiwork of man.\r\n\r\n29  Ashbina wrote the fourth:\r\n\r\n30  Seeds do not germinate in light; they do not grow until they find\r\nthe soil, and hide themselves away from light.\r\n\r\n31  Man was evolved a seed of everlasting life; but in the ethers of\r\nthe Triune God the light was far too great for seeds to grow;\r\n\r\n32  And so man sought the soil of carnal life, and in the darksomeness\r\nof earth he found a place where he could germinate and grow.\r\n\r\n33  The seed has taken root and grown full well.\r\n\r\n34  The tree of human life is rising from the soil of earthy things,\r\nand, under natural law, is reaching up to perfect form.\r\n\r\n35  There are no supernatural acts of God to lift a man from carnal\r\nlife to spirit blessedness; he grows as grows the plant, and in due\r\ntime is perfected.\r\n\r\n36  The quality of soul that makes it possible for man to rise to\r\nspirit life is purity.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 59.\r\n\r\n    _Meeting of the sages, continued. The remaining postulates. The\r\n      sages bless Jesus. Seven days’ silence._\r\n\r\nApollo wrote the fifth:\r\n\r\n2  The soul is drawn to perfect light by four white steeds, and these\r\nare Will, and Faith, and Helpfulness and Love.\r\n\r\n3  That which one wills to do, he has the power to do.\r\n\r\n4  A knowledge of that power is faith; and when faith moves, the soul\r\nbegins its flight.\r\n\r\n5  A selfish faith leads not to light. There is no lonely pilgrim on\r\nthe way to light. Men only gain the heights by helping others gain the\r\nheights.\r\n\r\n6  The steed that leads the way to spirit life is Love; is pure\r\nunselfish Love.\r\n\r\n7  Matheno wrote the sixth:\r\n\r\n8  The universal Love of which Apollo speaks is child of Wisdom and of\r\nWill divine, and God has sent it forth to earth in flesh that man may\r\nknow.\r\n\r\n9  The universal Love of which the sages speak, is Christ.\r\n\r\n10  The greatest mystery of all times lies in the way that Christ lives\r\nin the heart.\r\n\r\n11  Christ cannot live in clammy dens of carnal things. The seven\r\nbattles must be fought, the seven victories won before the carnal\r\nthings, like fear, and self, emotions and desire, are put away.\r\n\r\n12  When this is done the Christ will take possession of the soul; the\r\nwork is done, and man and God are one.\r\n\r\n13  And Philo wrote the seventh:\r\n\r\n14  A perfect man! To bring before the Triune God a being such as this\r\nwas nature made.\r\n\r\n15  This consummation is the highest revelation of the mystery of life.\r\n\r\n16  When all the essences of carnal things have been transmuted into\r\nsoul, and all the essences of soul have been returned to Holy Breath,\r\nand man is made a perfect God, the drama of Creation will conclude.\r\nAnd this is all.\r\n\r\n17  And all the sages said, Amen.\r\n\r\n18  Then Meng-ste said, The Holy One has sent to us a man illumined by\r\nthe efforts of unnumbered years, to lead the thoughts of men.\r\n\r\n19  This man, approved by all the master minds of heaven and earth,\r\nthis man from Galilee, this Jesus, chief of all the sages of the\r\nworld, we gladly recognize.\r\n\r\n20  In recognition of this wisdom that he brings to men, we crown him\r\nwith the Lotus wreath.\r\n\r\n21  We send him forth with all the blessing of the seven sages of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n22  Then all the sages laid their hands on Jesus’ head, and said with\r\none accord, Praise God!\r\n\r\n23  For wisdom, honor, glory, power, riches, blessing, strength, are\r\nyours, O Christ, forever more.\r\n\r\n24  And every living creature said, Amen.\r\n\r\n25  And then the sages sat in silence seven days.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 60.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus addresses the seven sages. The address. Jesus goes to\r\n      Galilee._\r\n\r\nThe seven days of silence passed and Jesus, sitting with the sages\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n2  The history of life is well condensed in these immortal postulates.\r\nThese are the seven hills on which the holy city shall be built.\r\n\r\n3  These are the seven sure foundation stones on which the Universal\r\nChurch shall stand.\r\n\r\n4  In taking up the work assigned for me to do I am full conscious of\r\nthe perils of the way; the cup will be a bitter one to drink and human\r\nnature well might shrink.\r\n\r\n5  But I have lost my will in that of Holy Breath, and so I go my way\r\nto speak and act as I am moved to speak and act by Holy Breath.\r\n\r\n6  The words I speak are not my own; they are the words of him whose\r\nwill I do.\r\n\r\n7  Man is not far enough advanced in sacred thought to comprehend the\r\nUniversal Church, and so the work that God has given me to do is not\r\nthe building of that Church.\r\n\r\n8  I am a model maker, sent to make a pattern of the Church that is to\r\nbe--a pattern that the age may comprehend.\r\n\r\n9  My task as model builder lies within my native land, and there, upon\r\nthe postulate that Love is son of God, that I am come to manifest that\r\nLove, the Model Church will stand.\r\n\r\n10  And from the men of low estate I will select twelve men, who\r\nrepresent the twelve immortal thoughts; and these will be the Model\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\n11  The house of Judah, my own kindred in the flesh, will comprehend\r\nbut little of my mission to the world.\r\n\r\n12  And they will spurn me, scorn my work, accuse me falsely, bind me,\r\ntake me to the judgment seat of carnal men who will convict and slay\r\nme on the cross.\r\n\r\n13  But men can never slay the truth; though banished it will come\r\nagain in greater power; for truth will subjugate the world.\r\n\r\n14  The Model Church will live. Though carnal man will prostitute its\r\nsacred laws, symbolic rites and forms, for selfish ends, and make it\r\nbut an outward show, the few will find through it the kingdom of the\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n15  And when the better age shall come the Universal Church will stand\r\nupon the seven postulates, and will be built according to the pattern\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n16  The time has come; I go my way unto Jerusalem, and by the power of\r\nliving faith, and by the strength that you have given,\r\n\r\n17  And in the name of God, our Father-God, the kingdom of the soul\r\nshall be established on the seven hills,\r\n\r\n18  And all the peoples, tribes and tongues of earth shall enter in.\r\n\r\n19  The Prince of Peace will take his seat upon the throne of power;\r\nthe Triune God will then be All in All.\r\n\r\n20  And all the sages said, Amen.\r\n\r\n21  And Jesus went his way, and after many days, he reached Jerusalem;\r\nand then he sought his home in Galilee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XIII.\r\n\r\nMEM.\r\n\r\n_The Ministry of John, the Harbinger._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 61.\r\n\r\n    _John, the harbinger, returns to Hebron. Lives as a hermit in\r\n      the wilds. Visits Jerusalem and speaks to the people._\r\n\r\nIt came to pass when John, the son of Zacharias and Elizabeth, had\r\nfinished all his studies in the Egyptian schools that he returned to\r\nHebron, where he abode for certain days.\r\n\r\n2  And then he sought the wilderness and made his home in David’s cave\r\nwhere many years before, he was instructed by the Egyptian sage.\r\n\r\n3  Some people called him Hermit of Engedi; and others said, He is the\r\nWild Man of the hills.\r\n\r\n4  He clothed himself with skins of beasts; his food was carobs, honey,\r\nnuts and fruits.\r\n\r\n5  When John was thirty years of age he went into Jerusalem, and in the\r\nmarket place he sat in silence seven days.\r\n\r\n6  The common people and the priests, the scribes and Pharisees came\r\nout in multitudes to see the silent hermit of the hills; but none were\r\nbold enough to ask him who he was.\r\n\r\n7  But when his silent fast was done he stood forth in the midst of all\r\nand said,\r\n\r\n8  Behold, the king has come; the prophets told of him; the wise men\r\nlong have looked for him.\r\n\r\n9  Prepare, O Israel, prepare to meet your king.\r\n\r\n10  And that was all he said, and then he disappeared, and no one knew\r\nwhere he had gone.\r\n\r\n11  And there was great unrest through all Jerusalem. The rulers heard\r\nthe story of the hermit of the hills,\r\n\r\n12  And they sent couriers forth to talk with him that they might know\r\nabout the coming king; but they could find him not.\r\n\r\n13  And after certain days he came again into the market place, and all\r\nthe city came to hear him speak; he said,\r\n\r\n14  Be not disturbed, you rulers of the state; the coming king is no\r\nantagonist; he seeks no place on any earthly throne.\r\n\r\n15  He comes the Prince of Peace, the king of righteousness and love;\r\nhis kingdom is within the soul.\r\n\r\n16  The eyes of men shall see it not and none can enter but the pure\r\nin heart.\r\n\r\n17  Prepare, O Israel, prepare to meet your king.\r\n\r\n18  Again the hermit disappeared; the people strove to follow him, but\r\nhe had drawn a veil about his form and men could see him not.\r\n\r\n19  A Jewish feast day came; Jerusalem was filled with Jews and\r\nproselytes from every part of Palestine, and John stood in the temple\r\ncourt and said,\r\n\r\n20  Prepare, O Israel, prepare to meet your king.\r\n\r\n21  Lo, you have lived in sin; the poor cry in your streets, and you\r\nregard them not.\r\n\r\n22  Your neighbors, who are they? You have defrauded friend and foe\r\nalike.\r\n\r\n23  You worship God with voice and lip; your hearts are far away, and\r\nset on gold.\r\n\r\n24  Your priests have bound upon the people burdens far too great to\r\nbear; they live in ease upon the hard earned wages of the poor.\r\n\r\n25  Your lawyers, doctors, scribes are useless cumberers of the ground;\r\nthey are but tumors on the body of the state;\r\n\r\n26  They toil not neither do they spin, yet they consume the profits of\r\nyour marts of trade.\r\n\r\n27  Your rulers are adulterers, extortioners and thieves, regarding not\r\nthe rights of any man;\r\n\r\n28  And robbers ply their calling in the sacred halls; the holy temple\r\nyou have sold to thieves; their dens are in the sacred places set\r\napart for prayer.\r\n\r\n29  Hear! hear! you people of Jerusalem! Reform; turn from your evil\r\nways or God will turn from you, and heathen from afar will come, and\r\nwhat is left of all your honor and your fame will pass in one short\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n30  Prepare, Jerusalem, prepare to meet your king.\r\n\r\n31  He said no more; he left the court and no one saw him go.\r\n\r\n32  The priests, the doctors and the scribes were all in rage. They\r\nsought for John intent to do him harm. They found him not.\r\n\r\n33  The common people stood in his defense; they said, The hermit\r\nspeaks the truth.\r\n\r\n34  And then the priests, the doctors and the scribes were sore afraid;\r\nthey said no more; they hid themselves away.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 62.\r\n\r\n    _John, the harbinger, again visits Jerusalem. Speaks to the\r\n      people. Promises to meet them at Gilgal in seven days. Goes\r\n      to Bethany and attends a feast._\r\n\r\nNext day John went again into the temple courts and said,\r\n\r\n2  Prepare, O Israel, prepare to meet your king.\r\n\r\n3  The chief priests and the scribes would know the meaning of his\r\nwords; they said,\r\n\r\n4  Bold man, what is the purport of this message that you bring to\r\nIsrael? If you be seer and prophet, tell us plainly who has sent you\r\nhere?\r\n\r\n5  And John replied, I am the voice of one who cries out in the\r\nwilderness, Prepare the way, make straight the paths, for, lo, the\r\nPrince of Peace will come to rule in love.\r\n\r\n6  Your prophet Malachi wrote down the words of God:\r\n\r\n7  And I will send Elijah unto you before the retribution day shall\r\ncome, to turn again the hearts of men to God and if they will not\r\nturn, lo, I will smite them with a curse.\r\n\r\n8  You men of Israel; you know your sins. As I passed by I saw a\r\nwounded bird prone in your streets, and men of every class were\r\nbeating it with clubs; and then I saw that Justice was its name.\r\n\r\n9  I looked again and saw that its companion had been killed; the pure\r\nwhite wings of Righteousness were trampled in the dust.\r\n\r\n10  I tell you men, your awfulness of guilt has made a cesspool of\r\niniquity that sends a fearful stench to heaven.\r\n\r\n11  Reform, O Israel, reform; prepare to meet your king.\r\n\r\n12  And then John turned away and as he went he said,\r\n\r\n13  In seven days, lo, I will stand at Gilgal, by the Jordan ford,\r\nwhere Israel first crossed into the promised land.\r\n\r\n14  And then he left the temple court to enter it no more; but many\r\npeople followed him as far as Bethany, and there he tarried at the\r\nhome of Lazarus, his kin.\r\n\r\n15  The anxious people gathered all about the home and would not go;\r\nthen John came forth and said,\r\n\r\n16  Reform, O Israel, reform; prepare to meet your king.\r\n\r\n17  The sins of Israel do not all lie at the door of priest and scribe.\r\nO think you not that all the sinners of Judea are found among the\r\nrulers and the men of wealth.\r\n\r\n18  It is no sign that man is good and pure because he lives in want.\r\n\r\n19  The listless, shiftless vagabonds of earth are mostly poor and have\r\nto beg for bread.\r\n\r\n20  I saw the very men that cheered because I told the priests and\r\nscribes of their injustice unto man, throw stones and beat poor\r\nJustice in the streets.\r\n\r\n21  I saw them trample on the poor dead bird of Righteousness;\r\n\r\n22  And you who follow after me, you commoners, are not one whit behind\r\nthe scribes and priests in crime.\r\n\r\n23  Reform, you men of Israel; the king has come; prepare to meet your\r\nking.\r\n\r\n24  With Lazarus and his sisters, John remained for certain days.\r\n\r\n25  In honor of the Nazarite a feast was spread, and all the people\r\nstood about the board.\r\n\r\n26  And when the chief men of the town poured out the sparkling wine\r\nand offered John a cup, he took it, held it high in air, and said,\r\n\r\n27  Wine makes glad the carnal heart, and it makes sad the human soul;\r\nit plunges deep in bitterness and gall the deathless spirit of the man.\r\n\r\n28  I took the vow of Nazar when a child, and not a drop has ever\r\npassed my lips.\r\n\r\n29  And if you would make glad the coming king, then shun the cup as\r\nyou would shun a deadly thing.\r\n\r\n30  And then he threw the sparkling wine out in the street.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 63.\r\n\r\n    _John, the harbinger, visits Jericho. Meets the people at\r\n      Gilgal. Announces his mission. Introduces the rite of\r\n      baptism. Baptizes many people. Returns to Bethany and\r\n      teaches. Returns to the Jordan._\r\n\r\nAnd John went down to Jericho; there he abode with Alpheus.\r\n\r\n2  And when the people heard that he was there they came in throngs to\r\nhear him speak.\r\n\r\n3  He spoke to none; but when the time was due he went down to the\r\nJordan ford, and to the multitudes he said,\r\n\r\n4  Reform and in the fount of purity wash all your sins away; the\r\nkingdom is at hand.\r\n\r\n5  Come unto me and in the waters of this stream be washed, symbolic of\r\nthe inner cleansing of the soul.\r\n\r\n6  And, lo, the multitudes came down and in the Jordan they were\r\nwashed, and every man confessed his sins.\r\n\r\n7  For many months, in all the regions round about, John plead for\r\npurity and righteousness; and after many days he went again to\r\nBethany; and there he taught.\r\n\r\n8  At first few but the honest seekers came; but, by and by, the\r\nselfish and the vicious came with no contrition; came because the many\r\ncame.\r\n\r\n9  And when John saw the unrepentant Pharisees and Sadducees come unto\r\nhim, he said,\r\n\r\n10  You children of the vipers, stay; are you disturbed by news of\r\ncoming wrath?\r\n\r\n11  Go to, and do the things that prove repentance genuine.\r\n\r\n12  Is it enough for you to say that you are heirs of Abraham? I tell\r\nyou, no.\r\n\r\n13  The heirs of Abraham are just as wicked in the sight of God when\r\nthey do wrong as any heathen man.\r\n\r\n14  Behold the ax! and every tree that bears not wholesome fruit is cut\r\ndown at the roots and cast into the fire.\r\n\r\n15  And then the people asked, What must we do?\r\n\r\n16  And John replied, Accept the ministry of helpfulness for all\r\nmankind; spend not upon your selfish selves all that you have.\r\n\r\n17  Let him who has two coats give one to him who has no coat; give\r\npart of all the food you have to those in need.\r\n\r\n18  And when the publicans came up and asked, What must we do? John\r\nanswered them,\r\n\r\n19  Be honest in your work; do not increase for selfish gain the\r\ntribute you collect; take nothing more than what your king demands.\r\n\r\n20  And when the soldiers came and asked, What must we do? The\r\nharbinger replied,\r\n\r\n21  Do violence to none; exact no wrongful thing, and be contented with\r\nthe wages you receive.\r\n\r\n22  Among the Jews were many who had been waiting for the Christ to\r\ncome, and they regarded John as Christ.\r\n\r\n23  But to their questions John replied, In water I do cleanse,\r\nsymbolic of the cleansing of the soul; but when he comes who is to\r\ncome, lo, he will cleanse in Holy Breath and purify in fire.\r\n\r\n24  His fan is in his hand, and he will separate the wheat and chaff;\r\nwill throw the chaff away, but garner every grain of wheat. This is\r\nthe Christ.\r\n\r\n25  Behold he comes! and he will walk with you, and you will know him\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n26  He is the king; the latchet of his shoes I am not worthy to unloose.\r\n\r\n27  And John left Bethany and went again unto the Jordan ford.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 64.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus comes from Galilee, and is baptized by John. The Holy\r\n      Breath testifies of his messiahship._\r\n\r\nThe news reached Galilee, and Jesus with the multitude went down to\r\nwhere the harbinger was preaching at the ford.\r\n\r\n2  When Jesus saw the harbinger he said, Behold the man of God! Behold\r\nthe greatest of the seers! Behold, Elijah has returned!\r\n\r\n3  Behold the messenger whom God has sent to open up the way! The\r\nkingdom is at hand.\r\n\r\n4  When John saw Jesus standing with the throng he said, Behold the\r\nking who cometh in the name of God!\r\n\r\n5  And Jesus said to John, I would be washed in water as a symbol of\r\nthe cleansing of the soul.\r\n\r\n6  And John replied, You do not need to wash, for you are pure in\r\nthought, and word, and deed. And if you need to wash I am not worthy\r\nto perform the rite.\r\n\r\n7  And Jesus said, I come to be a pattern for the sons of men, and what\r\nI bid them do, that I must do; and all men must be washed, symbolic of\r\nthe cleansing of the soul.\r\n\r\n8  This washing we establish as a rite--baptism rite we call it now,\r\nand so it shall be called.\r\n\r\n9  Your work, prophetic harbinger, is to prepare the way, and to reveal\r\nthe hidden things.\r\n\r\n10  The multitudes are ready for the words of life, and I have come to\r\nbe made known by you to all the world, as prophet of the Triune God,\r\nand as the chosen one to manifest the Christ to men.\r\n\r\n11  Then John led Jesus down into the river at the ford and he baptized\r\nhim in the sacred name of him who sent him forth to manifest the\r\nChrist to men.\r\n\r\n12  And as they came out of the stream, the Holy Breath, in form of\r\ndove, came down and sat on Jesus’ head.\r\n\r\n13  A voice from heaven said, This is the well-beloved son of God, the\r\nChrist, the love of God made manifest.\r\n\r\n14  John heard the voice, and understood the message of the voice.\r\n\r\n15  Now Jesus went his way, and John preached to the multitude.\r\n\r\n16  As many as confessed their sins, and turned from evil ways to ways\r\nof right, the harbinger baptized, symbolic of the blotting out of sins\r\nby righteousness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XIV.\r\n\r\nNUN.\r\n\r\n_The Christine Ministry of Jesus--Introductory Epoch._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 65.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus goes to the wilderness for self-examination, where he\r\n      remains forty days.

Returns to the camps of John and begins teaching._\r\n\r\nThe harbinger had paved the way; the Logos had been introduced to men\r\nas love made manifest, and he must now begin his Christine ministry.\r\n\r\n2  And he went forth into the wilderness to be alone with God that he\r\nmight look into his inner heart, and note its strength and worthiness.\r\n\r\n3  And with himself he talked; he said, My lower self is strong; by\r\nmany ties I am bound down to carnal life.\r\n\r\n4  Have I the strength to overcome and give my life a willing sacrifice\r\nfor men?\r\n\r\n5  When I shall stand before the face of men, and they demand a proof\r\nof my messiahship, what will I say?\r\n\r\n6  And then the tempter came and said, If you be son of God, command\r\nthese stones to turn to bread.\r\n\r\n7  And Jesus said, Who is it that demands a test? It is no sign that\r\none is son of God because he does a miracle; the devils can do mighty\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n8  Did not the black magicians do great things before the Pharaohs?\r\n\r\n9  My words and deeds in all the walks of life shall be the proof of my\r\nmessiahship.\r\n\r\n10  And then the tempter said, If you will go into Jerusalem, and from\r\nthe temple pinnacle cast down yourself to earth, the people will\r\nbelieve that you are the Messiah sent from God.\r\n\r\n11  This you can surely do; for did not David say, He gives his angels\r\ncharge concerning you, and with their hands will they uphold lest you\r\nshould fall?\r\n\r\n12  And Jesus said, I may not tempt the Lord, my God.\r\n\r\n13  And then the tempter said, Look forth upon the world; behold its\r\nhonors and its fame! Behold its pleasures and its wealth!\r\n\r\n14  If you will give your life for these they shall be yours.\r\n\r\n15  But Jesus said, Away from me all tempting thoughts. My heart is\r\nfixed; I spurn this carnal self with all its vain ambition and its\r\npride.\r\n\r\n16  For forty days did Jesus wrestle with his carnal self; his higher\r\nself prevailed. He then was hungry, but his friends had found him and\r\nthey ministered to him.\r\n\r\n17  Then Jesus left the wilderness, and in the consciousness of Holy\r\nBreath, he came unto the camps of John and taught.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 66.\r\n\r\n    _Six of John’s disciples follow Jesus and become his disciples.\r\n      He teaches them. They sit in the Silence._\r\n\r\nAmong the followers of John were many men from Galilee. The most\r\ndevout were Andrew, Simon, James, and John, with Philip and his\r\nbrother of Bethsaida.\r\n\r\n2  One day as Andrew, Philip and a son of Zebedee, were talking with\r\nthe harbinger, the Logos came, and John exclaimed, Behold the Christ!\r\n\r\n3  And then the three disciples followed Jesus, and he asked, What do\r\nyou seek?\r\n\r\n4  And the disciples asked, Where do you live? And Jesus answered, Come\r\nand see.\r\n\r\n5  And Andrew called his brother Simon, saying, Come with me, for I\r\nhave found the Christ.\r\n\r\n6  When Jesus looked in Simon’s face he said, Behold a rock! and Peter\r\nis your name.\r\n\r\n7  And Philip found Nathaniel sitting by a tree, and said, My brother,\r\ncome with me, for I have found the Christ! In Nazareth he abides.\r\n\r\n8  Nathaniel said, Can anything of good come out of Nazareth? And\r\nPhilip answered, Come and see.\r\n\r\n9  When Jesus saw Nathaniel come he said, Behold an Israelite indeed in\r\nwhom there is no guile!\r\n\r\n10  Nathaniel said, How can you speak about me thus?\r\n\r\n11  And Jesus said, I saw you as you sat beneath the fig tree over\r\nthere, before your brother called.\r\n\r\n12  Nathaniel lifted up his hands and said, This surely is the Christ,\r\nthe king, for whom the harbinger has often testified.\r\n\r\n13  And John went forth and found his brother James, and brought him to\r\nthe Christ.\r\n\r\n14  The six disciples went with Jesus to the place where he abode.\r\n\r\n15  And Peter said, We long have sought for Christ. We came from\r\nGalilee to John; we thought that he was Christ, but he confessed to us\r\nthat he was not;\r\n\r\n16  That he was but the harbinger sent forth to clear the way, and\r\nmake the pathway easy for the coming king; and when you came he said,\r\nBehold the Christ!\r\n\r\n17  And we would gladly follow where you go. Lord, tell us what to do.\r\n\r\n18  And Jesus said, The foxes of the earth have homes, the birds have\r\nnests; I have no place to lay my head.\r\n\r\n19  He who would follow me must give up all the cravings of the self\r\nand lose his life in saving life.\r\n\r\n20  I come to save the lost, and man is saved when he is rescued from\r\nhimself. But men are slow to comprehend this doctrine of the Christ.\r\n\r\n21  And Peter said, I cannot speak for any other man, but for myself I\r\nspeak: I will leave all and follow where you lead.\r\n\r\n22  And then the others spoke and said, You have the words of truth;\r\nyou came from God, and if we follow in your footsteps we cannot miss\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\n23  Then Jesus and the six disciples sat a long, long time in silent\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 67.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus visits John at the Jordan. Delivers his first Christine\r\n      address to the people. The address. He goes with his\r\n      disciples to Bethany._\r\n\r\nNow, on the morrow Jesus came again and stood with John beside the\r\nford; and John prevailed on him to speak, and standing forth he said,\r\n\r\n2  You men of Israel, hear! The kingdom is at hand.\r\n\r\n3  Behold the great key-keeper of the age stands in your midst; and\r\nwith the spirit of Elijah he has come.\r\n\r\n4  Behold, for he has turned the key; the mighty gates fly wide and all\r\nwho will may greet the king.\r\n\r\n5  Behold these multitudes of women, children, men! they throng the\r\navenues, they crowd the outer courts; each seems to be intent to be\r\nthe first to meet the king.\r\n\r\n6  Behold, the censor comes and calls, Whoever will may come; but he\r\nwho comes must will to prune himself of every evil thought;\r\n\r\n7  Must overcome desire to gratify the lower self; must give his life\r\nto save the lost.\r\n\r\n8  The nearer to the kingdom gate you come, more spacious is the room;\r\nthe multitudes have gone.\r\n\r\n9  If men could come unto the kingdom with their carnal thoughts, their\r\npassions and desires, there scarcely would be room for all.\r\n\r\n10  But when they cannot take these through the narrow gate they turn\r\naway; the few are ready to go in and see the king.\r\n\r\n11  Behold, John is a mighty fisher, fishing for the souls of men. He\r\nthrows his great net out into the sea of human life; he draws it in\r\nand it is full.\r\n\r\n12  But what a medley catch! a catch of crabs, and lobsters, sharks and\r\ncreeping things, with now and then a fish of better kind.\r\n\r\n13  Behold, the thousands come to hear the Wild Man of the hills; they\r\ncome in crowds that he may wash them in the crystal flood, and with\r\ntheir lips they do confess their sins.\r\n\r\n14  But when the morrow comes we find them in their haunts of vice\r\nagain, reviling John, and cursing God, and heaping insults on the king.\r\n\r\n15  But blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see the king.\r\n\r\n16  And blessed are the strong in heart, for they shall not be cast\r\nabout by every wind that blows;\r\n\r\n17  But while the fickle and the thoughtless have gone back to Egypt\r\nland for leeks and carnal herbs to satisfy their appetites, the pure\r\nin heart have found the king.\r\n\r\n18  But even those whose faith is weak, and who are naught but carnal\r\nmanifests, will some day come again, and enter in with joy to see the\r\nking.\r\n\r\n19  O men of Israel, take heed to what this prophet has to say! Be\r\nstrong in mind; be pure in heart; be vigilant in helpfulness; the\r\nkingdom is at hand.\r\n\r\n20  When Jesus had thus said he went his way, and with his six\r\ndisciples came to Bethany; and they abode with Lazarus many days.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 68.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus speaks to the people in Bethany. Tells them how to\r\n      become pure in heart. Goes to Jerusalem and in the temple\r\n      reads from a prophetic book. Goes to Nazareth._\r\n\r\nThe news soon spread abroad that Jesus, king of Israel, had come to\r\nBethany, and all the people of the town came forth to greet the king.\r\n\r\n2  And Jesus, standing in the midst of them exclaimed, Behold, indeed,\r\nthe king has come, but Jesus is not king.\r\n\r\n3  The kingdom truly is at hand; but men can see it not with carnal\r\neyes; they cannot see the king upon the throne.\r\n\r\n4  This is the kingdom of the soul; its throne is not an earthly\r\nthrone; its king is not a man.\r\n\r\n5  When human kings found kingdoms here, they conquer other kings by\r\nforce of arms; one kingdom rises on the ruins of another one.\r\n\r\n6  But when our Father-God sets up the kingdom of the soul, he pours\r\nhis blessings forth, like rain, upon the thrones of earthly kings who\r\nrule in righteousness.\r\n\r\n7  It is not rule that God would overthrow; his sword is raised against\r\ninjustice, wantonness and crime.\r\n\r\n8  Now, while the kings of Rome do justice, and love mercy and walk\r\nhumbly with their God, the benediction of the Triune God will rest\r\nupon them all.\r\n\r\n9  They need not fear a messenger whom God sends forth to earth.\r\n\r\n10  I am not sent to sit upon a throne to rule as Cæsar rules; and you\r\nmay tell the ruler of the Jews that I am not a claimant for his throne.\r\n\r\n11  Men call me Christ, and God has recognized the name; but Christ is\r\nnot a man. The Christ is universal love, and Love is king.\r\n\r\n12  This Jesus is but man who has been fitted by temptations overcome,\r\nby trials multiform, to be the temple through which Christ can\r\nmanifest to men.\r\n\r\n13  Then hear, you men of Israel, hear! Look not upon the flesh; it is\r\nnot king. Look to the Christ within, who shall be formed in every one\r\nof you, as he is formed in me.\r\n\r\n14  When you have purified your hearts by faith, the king will enter\r\nin, and you will see his face.\r\n\r\n15  And then the people asked, What must we do that we may make our\r\nbodies fit abiding places for the king?\r\n\r\n16  And Jesus said, Whatever tends to purity in thought, and word, and\r\ndeed will cleanse the temple of the flesh.\r\n\r\n17  There are no rules that can apply to all, for men are specialists\r\nin sin; each has his own besetting sin,\r\n\r\n18  And each must study for himself how he can best transmute his\r\ntendency to evil things to that of righteousness and love.\r\n\r\n19  Until men reach the higher plane, and get away from selfishness,\r\nthis rule will give the best results:\r\n\r\n20  Do unto other men what you would have them do to you.\r\n\r\n21  And many of the people said, We know that Jesus is the Christ, the\r\nking who was to come, and blessed be his name.\r\n\r\n22  Now, Jesus and his six disciples turned their faces toward\r\nJerusalem, and many people followed them.\r\n\r\n23  But Mathew, son of Alpheus, ran on before, and when he reached\r\nJerusalem, he said, Behold the Christines come! The multitudes came\r\nforth to see the king.\r\n\r\n24  But Jesus did not speak to any one until he reached the temple\r\ncourt, and then he opened up a book and read:\r\n\r\n25  Behold, I send my messenger, and he will pave the way, and Christ,\r\nfor whom you wait, will come unto his temple unannounced. Behold, for\r\nhe will come, says God, the Lord of hosts.\r\n\r\n26  And then he closed the book; he said no more; he left the temple\r\nhalls, and with his six disciples, went his way to Nazareth,\r\n\r\n27  And they abode with Mary, Jesus’ mother, and her sister, Miriam.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 69.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus and the ruler of the synagogue of Nazareth. Jesus\r\n      teaches not in public, and the people are amazed._\r\n\r\nNext day as Peter walked about in Nazareth, he met the ruler of the\r\nsynagogue who asked, Who is this Jesus lately come to Nazareth?\r\n\r\n2  And Peter said, This Jesus is the Christ of whom our prophets wrote;\r\nhe is the king of Israel. His mother, Mary, lives on Marmion Way.\r\n\r\n3  The ruler said, Tell him to come up to the synagogue, for I would\r\nhear his plea.\r\n\r\n4  And Peter ran and told to Jesus what the ruler said; but Jesus\r\nanswered not; he went not to the synagogue.\r\n\r\n5  Then in the evening time the ruler came up Marmion Way, and in the\r\nhome of Mary found he Jesus and his mother all alone.\r\n\r\n6  And when the ruler asked for proof of his messiahship, and why he\r\nwent not to the synagogue when he was bidden, Jesus said,\r\n\r\n7  I am not slave to any man; I am not called unto this ministry by\r\npriest. It is not mine to answer when men call. I come the Christ of\r\nGod; I answer unto God alone.\r\n\r\n8  Who gave you right to ask for proof of my messiahship? My proof lies\r\nin my words and works, and so if you will follow me you will not lack\r\nfor proof.\r\n\r\n9  And then the ruler went his way; he asked himself, What manner of a\r\nman is this to disregard the ruler of the synagogue?\r\n\r\n10  The people of the town came out in throngs to see the Christ, and\r\nhear him speak; but Jesus said,\r\n\r\n11  A prophet has no honor in his native town, among his kin.\r\n\r\n12  I will not speak in Nazareth until the words I speak, and works I\r\ndo in other towns have won the faith of men,\r\n\r\n13  Until men know that God has christed me to manifest eternal love.\r\n\r\n14  Good will to you, my kin; I bless you with a boundless love, and I\r\nbespeak for you abundant joy and happiness.\r\n\r\n15  He said no more, and all the people marveled much because he would\r\nnot speak in Nazareth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 70.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus and his disciples at a marriage feast in Cana. Jesus\r\n      speaks on marriage. He turns water into wine. The people are\r\n      amazed._\r\n\r\nIn Cana, Galilee, there was a marriage feast, and Mary and her sister\r\nMiriam, and Jesus and his six disciples were among the guests.\r\n\r\n2  The ruler of the feast had heard that Jesus was a master sent from\r\nGod, and he requested him to speak.\r\n\r\n3  And Jesus said, There is no tie more sacred than the marriage tie.\r\n\r\n4  The chain that binds two souls in love is made in heaven, and man\r\ncan never sever it in twain,\r\n\r\n5  The lower passions of the twain may cause a union of the twain, a\r\nunion as when oil and water meet.\r\n\r\n6  And then a priest may forge a chain, and bind the twain. This is not\r\nmarriage genuine; it is a counterfeit.\r\n\r\n7  The twain are guilty of adultery; the priest is party to the crime.\r\nAnd that was all that Jesus said.\r\n\r\n8  As Jesus stood apart in silent thought his mother came and said to\r\nhim, The wine has failed; what shall we do?\r\n\r\n9  And Jesus said, Pray what is wine? It is but water with the\r\nflavoring of grapes.\r\n\r\n10  And what are grapes? They are but certain kinds of thought made\r\nmanifest, and I can manifest that thought, and water will be wine.\r\n\r\n11  He called the servants, and he said to them, Bring in six water\r\npots of stone, a pot for each of these, my followers, and fill them up\r\nwith water to the brims,\r\n\r\n12  The servants brought the water pots, and filled them to their brims.\r\n\r\n13  And Jesus with a mighty thought stirred up the ethers till they\r\nreached the manifest, and, lo, the water blushed, and turned to wine.\r\n\r\n14  The servants took the wine and gave it to the ruler of the feast\r\nwho called the bridegroom in and said to him,\r\n\r\n15  This wine is best of all; most people when they give a feast bring\r\nin the best wine at the first; but, lo, you have reserved the best\r\nuntil the last.\r\n\r\n16  And when the ruler and the guests were told that Jesus, by the\r\npower of thought, had turned the water into wine, they were amazed;\r\n\r\n17  They said, This man is more than man; he surely is the christed one\r\nwho prophets of the olden times declared would come.\r\n\r\n18  And many of the guests believed on him, and gladly would have\r\nfollowed him.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 71.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus, his six disciples and his mother, go to Capernaum.\r\n      Jesus teaches the people, revealing the difference between\r\n      the kings of earth and the kings of heaven._\r\n\r\nThe city of Capernaum was by the sea of Galilee, and Peter’s home was\r\nthere. The homes of Andrew, John and James were near,\r\n\r\n2  These men were fishermen, and must return to tend their nets, and\r\nthey prevailed on Jesus and his mother to accompany them, and soon\r\nwith Philip and Nathaniel they were resting by the sea in Peter’s home.\r\n\r\n3  The news spread through the city and along the shore that Judah’s\r\nking had come, and multitudes drew near to press his hand.\r\n\r\n4  And Jesus said, I cannot show the king, unless you see with eyes of\r\nsoul, because the kingdom of the king is in the soul.\r\n\r\n5  And every soul a kingdom is. There is a king for every man.\r\n\r\n6  This king is love, and when this love becomes the greatest power in\r\nlife, it is the Christ; so Christ is king.\r\n\r\n7  And every one may have this Christ dwell in his soul, as Christ\r\ndwells in my soul.\r\n\r\n8  The body is the temple of the king, and men may call a holy man a\r\nking.\r\n\r\n9  He who will cleanse his mortal form and make it pure, so pure that\r\nlove and righteousness may dwell unsullied side by side within its\r\nwalls, is king.\r\n\r\n10  The kings of earth are clothed in royal robes, and sit in state\r\nthat men may stand in awe of them.\r\n\r\n11  A king of heaven may wear a fisher’s garb; may sit in mart of\r\ntrade; may till the soil, or be a gleaner in the field; may be a slave\r\nin mortal chains;\r\n\r\n12  May be adjudged a criminal by men; may languish in a prison cell;\r\nmay die upon a cross.\r\n\r\n13  Men seldom see what others truly are. The human senses sense what\r\nseems to be, and that which seems to be and that which is, may be\r\ndiverse in every way.\r\n\r\n14  The carnal man beholds the outer man, which is the temple of the\r\nking, and worships at his shrine.\r\n\r\n15  The man of God is pure in heart; he sees the king; he sees with\r\neyes of soul;\r\n\r\n16  And when he rises to the plane of Christine consciousness, he knows\r\nthat he himself is king, is love, is Christ, and so is son of God.\r\n\r\n17  You men of Galilee, prepare to meet your king.\r\n\r\n18  And Jesus taught the people many lessons as he walked with them\r\nbeside the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XV.\r\n\r\nSAMECH.\r\n\r\n_The First Annual Epoch of the Christine Ministry of Jesus._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 72.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus in Jerusalem. Drives the merchants out of the temple.\r\n      The priests resent, and he defends himself from the\r\n      standpoint of a loyal Jew. He speaks to the people._\r\n\r\nThe Jewish paschal feast time came and Jesus left his mother in\r\nCapernaum and journeyed to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n2  And he abode with one a Sadducee, whose name was Jude.\r\n\r\n3  And when he reached the temple courts the multitudes were there to\r\nsee the prophet whom the people thought had come to break the yoke of\r\nRome, restore the kingdom of the Jews, and rule on David’s throne.\r\n\r\n4  And when the people saw him come they said, All hail! behold the\r\nking!\r\n\r\n5  But Jesus answered not; he saw the money changers in the house of\r\nGod, and he was grieved.\r\n\r\n6  The courts had been converted into marts of trade, and men were\r\nselling lambs and doves for offerings in sacrifice.\r\n\r\n7  And Jesus called the priests and said, Behold, for paltry gain you\r\nhave sold out the temple of the Lord.\r\n\r\n8  This house ordained for prayer is now a den of thieves. Can good and\r\nevil dwell together in the courts of God? I tell you, no.\r\n\r\n9  And then he made a scourge of cords and drove the merchants out; he\r\noverturned their boards, and threw their money on the floor.\r\n\r\n10  He opened up the cages of the captive birds, and cut the cords that\r\nbound the lambs, and set them free.\r\n\r\n11  The priests and scribes rushed out, and would have done him harm,\r\nbut they were driven back; the common people stood in his defense.\r\n\r\n12  And then the rulers said, Who is this Jesus you call king?\r\n\r\n13  The people said, He is the Christ of whom our prophets wrote; he is\r\nthe king who will deliver Israel.\r\n\r\n14  The rulers said to Jesus, Man, if you be king, or Christ, then show\r\nus signs. Who gave you right to drive these merchants out?\r\n\r\n15  And Jesus said, There is no loyal Jew who would not give his life\r\nto save this temple from disgrace; in this I acted simply as a loyal\r\nJew, and you yourselves will bear me witness to this truth.\r\n\r\n16  The signs of my messiahship will follow me in words and deeds.\r\n\r\n17  And you may tear the temple down (and you will tear it down) and in\r\nthree days it will be built again more glorious than before.\r\n\r\n18  Now Jesus meant that they might take his life; tear down his body,\r\ntemple of the Holy Breath, and he would rise again.\r\n\r\n19  The Jews knew not the meaning of his words; they laughed his claims\r\nto scorn. They said,\r\n\r\n20  A multitude of men were forty and six years in building up this\r\nhouse, and this young stranger claims that he will build it up in\r\nthree score hours; his words are idle, and his claims are naught.\r\n\r\n21  And then they took the scourge with which he drove the merchants\r\nout, and would have driven him away; but Philo, who had come from\r\nEgypt to attend the feast, stood forth and said,\r\n\r\n22  You men of Israel, hear! This man is more than man; take heed to\r\nwhat you do. I have, myself, heard Jesus speak, and all the winds were\r\nstill.\r\n\r\n23  And I have seen him touch the sick, and they were healed. He stands\r\na sage above the sages of the world;\r\n\r\n24  And you will see his star arise, and it will grow until it is the\r\nfull-orbed Sun of Righteousness.\r\n\r\n25  Do not be hasty, men; just wait and you will have the proofs of his\r\nmessiahship.\r\n\r\n26  And then the priests laid down the scourge, and Jesus said,\r\n\r\n27  Prepare, O Israel, prepare to meet your king! But you can never see\r\nthe king while you press sin as such a precious idol to your hearts.\r\n\r\n28  The king is God; the pure in heart alone can see the face of God\r\nand live.\r\n\r\n29  And then the priests cried out, This fellow claims to be the God.\r\nIs not this sacrilege! away with him!\r\n\r\n30  But Jesus said, No man has ever heard me say, I am a king. Our\r\nFather-God is king. With every loyal Jew I worship God.\r\n\r\n31  I am the candle of the Lord aflame to light the way; and while you\r\nhave the light walk in the light.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 73.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus again visits the temple, and is favorably received by\r\n      the people.

Defines\r\n      messiahship._\r\n\r\nNext day the multitudes were surging through the temple courts, intent\r\non hearing Jesus speak.\r\n\r\n2  And when he came the people said, All hail! behold the king!\r\n\r\n3  And Jesus spoke a parable; he said, A king had vast domains; his\r\npeople all were kin, and lived in peace.\r\n\r\n4  Now, after many years the king said to his people, Take these lands\r\nand all I have; enhance their values; rule yourselves, and live in\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n5  And then the people formed their states; selected governors and\r\npetty kings.\r\n\r\n6  But pride, ambition, selfish greed, and base ingratitude grew fast,\r\nand kings began to war.\r\n\r\n7  They wrote in all their statute books that might is right; and then\r\nthe strong destroyed the weak, and chaos reigned through all the vast\r\ndomain.\r\n\r\n8  A long time passed, and then the king looked out on his domain.\r\nHe saw his people in their cruel wars; he saw them sick and sore\r\ndistressed; he saw the strong enslave the weak,\r\n\r\n9  And then he said, What shall I do? Shall I send forth a scourge?\r\nshall I destroy my people all?\r\n\r\n10  And then his heart was stirred with pity and he said, I will not\r\nsend a scourge; I will send forth my only son, heir to the throne, to\r\nteach the people love, and peace, and righteousness.\r\n\r\n11  He sent his son; the people scorned him and maltreated him, and\r\nnailed him to a cross.\r\n\r\n12  He was entombed; but death was far too weak to hold the prince, and\r\nhe arose.\r\n\r\n13  He took a form man could not kill; and then he went again to teach\r\nthe people love, and peace and righteousness.\r\n\r\n14  And thus God deals with men.\r\n\r\n15  A lawyer came and asked, What does messiah mean? and who has right\r\nto make messiah of a man?\r\n\r\n16  And Jesus said, Messiah is one sent from God to seek and save the\r\nlost. Messiahs are not made by men.\r\n\r\n17  In first of every age Messiah comes to light the way; to heal up\r\nbroken hearts; to set the prisoners free. Messiah and the Christ are\r\none.\r\n\r\n18  Because a man claims to be Christ is not a sign that he is Christ.\r\n\r\n19  A man may cause the streams to flow from flinty rocks; may bring\r\non storms at will; may stay tempestuous winds; may heal the sick and\r\nraise the dead, and not be sent from God.\r\n\r\n20  All nature is subservient to the will of man, and evil men, as well\r\nas good, have all the powers of mind, and may control the elements.\r\n\r\n21  The head gives not the proof of true messiahship, for man by means\r\nof intellect, can never know of God, nor bring himself to walk in\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n22  Messiah lives not in the head, but in the heart, the seat of mercy\r\nand of love.\r\n\r\n23  Messiah never works for selfish gains; he stands above the carnal\r\nself; his words and deeds are for the universal good.\r\n\r\n24  Messiah never tries to be a king, to wear a crown and sit upon an\r\nearthly throne.\r\n\r\n25  The king is earthy, of the earth; Messiah is the man from heaven.\r\n\r\n26  And then the lawyer asked, Why do you pose as king?\r\n\r\n27  And Jesus said, No man has ever heard me say that I am king. I\r\ncould not sit in Cæsar’s place and be the Christ.\r\n\r\n28  Give unto Cæsar what belongs to him; give unto God the treasures of\r\nyour heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 74.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus heals on the Sabbath, and is censured by the Pharisees.\r\n      Restores a drowned child. Rescues a wounded dog. Cares for a\r\n      homeless child. Speaks on the law of kindness._\r\n\r\nIt was the Sabbath day, and Jesus stood among the surging masses of\r\nthe people in the temple courts and sacred halls.\r\n\r\n2  The blind, the deaf, the dumb, and those obsessed were there, and\r\nJesus spoke the Word, and they were healed.\r\n\r\n3  On some he laid his hands, and they were healed; to others he just\r\nspoke the Word, and they were full restored to health; but others had\r\nto go and wash in certain pools; and others he anointed with a holy\r\noil.\r\n\r\n4  A doctor asked him why he healed in divers ways, and he replied,\r\n\r\n5  Disease is discord in the human form, and discords are produced in\r\nmany ways.\r\n\r\n6  The body is a harpsichord; sometimes the strings are too relaxed,\r\nand then inharmony results.\r\n\r\n7  Sometimes we find the strings too tense, and then another form of\r\ndiscord is induced.\r\n\r\n8  Disease is many-formed, and there are many ways to cure, to tune\r\nanew the mystic harpsichord.\r\n\r\n9  Now when the Pharisees were told that Jesus healed the people on\r\nthe Sabbath day they were enraged, and they commanded him to quit the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n10  But Jesus said, Was man designed to fit the Sabbath day, or was\r\nthe Sabbath day designed to fit the man?\r\n\r\n11  If you had fallen in a pit and, lo, the Sabbath day had come, and I\r\nshould pass your way, would you cry out,\r\n\r\n12  Let me alone; it is a sin to help me on the Sabbath day; I’ll\r\nswelter in this filth until another day?\r\n\r\n13  You Pharisees, you hypocrites! you know you would be glad to have\r\nmy help upon the Sabbath day, or any other day.\r\n\r\n14  These people all have fallen into pits, and they are calling loud\r\nfor me to help them out, and man and God would curse me should I pass\r\nalong and heed them not.\r\n\r\n15  And then the Pharisees returned to say their prayers, and curse the\r\nman of God because he heeded not their words.\r\n\r\n16  Now, in the evening Jesus stood beside a pool; a playful child had\r\nfallen in, and it was drowned, and friends were bearing it away.\r\n\r\n17  But Jesus called the carriers to stop; and then he stretched\r\nhimself upon the lifeless form, and breathed into its mouth the breath\r\nof life.\r\n\r\n18  And then he called aloud unto the soul that had gone out, and it\r\nreturned; the child revived and lived.\r\n\r\n19  And Jesus saw a wounded dog; it could not move; it lay beside the\r\nway and groaned with pain. He took it in his arms and bore it to the\r\nhome where he abode.\r\n\r\n20  He poured the healing oil into the wounds; he cared for it as\r\nthough it were a child till it was strong and well.\r\n\r\n21  And Jesus saw a little boy who had no home, and he was hungry; when\r\nhe called for bread the people turned away.\r\n\r\n22  And Jesus took the child and gave him bread; he wrapped him in his\r\nown warm coat, and found for him a home.\r\n\r\n23  To those who followed him the master said, If man would gain again\r\nhis lost estate he must respect the brotherhood of life.\r\n\r\n24  Whoever is not kind to every form of life--to man, to beast, to\r\nbird, and creeping thing--cannot expect the blessings of the Holy One;\r\nfor as we give, so God will give to us.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 75.\r\n\r\n    _Nicodemus visits Jesus in the night. Jesus reveals to him the\r\n      meaning of the new birth and the kingdom of heaven._\r\n\r\nNicodemus was a ruler of the Jews, and he was earnest, learned and\r\ndevout.\r\n\r\n2  He saw the master’s signet in the face of Jesus as he talked, but\r\nwas not brave enough to publicly confess his faith in him;\r\n\r\n3  So in the night he went to talk with Jesus at the home of Jude.\r\n\r\n4  When Jesus saw him come he said, Full blessed are the pure in heart;\r\n\r\n5  Twice blessed are the fearless, pure in heart;\r\n\r\n6  Thrice blessed are the fearless, pure in heart who dare to make\r\nconfession of their faith before the highest courts.\r\n\r\n7  And Nicodemus said, Hail, master, hail! I know you are a teacher\r\ncome from God, for man alone could never teach as you have taught;\r\ncould never do the works that you have done.\r\n\r\n8  And Jesus said, Except a man be born again he cannot see the king;\r\nhe cannot comprehend the words I speak.\r\n\r\n9  And Nicodemus said, How can a man be born again? Can he go back into\r\nthe womb and come again to life?\r\n\r\n10  And Jesus said, The birth of which I speak is not the birth of\r\nflesh.\r\n\r\n11  Except a man be born of water and the Holy Breath, he cannot come\r\ninto the kingdom of the Holy One.\r\n\r\n12  That which is born of flesh is child of man; that which is born of\r\nHoly Breath is child of God.\r\n\r\n13  The winds blow where they please; men hear their voices, and may\r\nnote results; but they know not from whence they come, nor where they\r\ngo; and so is every one that is born of Holy Breath.\r\n\r\n14  The ruler said, I do not understand; pray tell me plainly what you\r\nmean.\r\n\r\n15  And Jesus said, The kingdom of the Holy One is in the soul; men\r\ncannot see it with their carnal eyes; with all their reasoning powers\r\nthey comprehend it not.\r\n\r\n16  It is a life deep hid in God; its recognition is the work of inner\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\n17  The kingdoms of the world are kingdoms of the sight; the kingdom of\r\nthe Holy One is that of faith; its king is love.\r\n\r\n18  Men cannot see the love of God unmanifest, and so our Father-God\r\nhas clothed this love with flesh--flesh of a son of man.\r\n\r\n19  And that the world may see and know this love made manifest, the\r\nson of man must needs be lifted up.\r\n\r\n20  As Moses in the wilderness raised up the serpent for the healing of\r\nthe flesh, the son of man must be raised up.\r\n\r\n21  That all men bitten by the serpent of the dust, the serpent of this\r\ncarnal life, may live.\r\n\r\n22  He who believes in him shall have eternal life.\r\n\r\n23  For God so loved the world that he sent forth his only son to be\r\nraised up that men may see the love of God.\r\n\r\n24  God did not send his son to judge the world; he sent him forth to\r\nsave the world; to bring men to the light.\r\n\r\n25  But men love not the light, for light reveals their wickedness; men\r\nlove the dark.\r\n\r\n26  Now, every one who loves the truth comes to the light; he does not\r\nfear to have his works made manifest.\r\n\r\n27  The light had come, and Nicodemus went his way; he knew the meaning\r\nof the birth of Holy Breath; he felt the presence of the Spirit in his\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n28  And Jesus tarried in Jerusalem for many days and taught and healed\r\nthe sick.\r\n\r\n29  The common people gladly listened to his words, and many left their\r\nall of carnal things and followed him.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 76.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus in Bethlehem. Explains the Empire of Peace to the\r\n      shepherds. An unusual light appears. The shepherds recognize\r\n      Jesus as the Christ._\r\n\r\nThe Logos went to Bethlehem, and many people followed him.\r\n\r\n2  He found the shepherd’s home where he was cradled when a babe; here\r\nhe abode.\r\n\r\n3  He went up to the hills where more than thirty years before the\r\nshepherds watch their flocks and heard the messenger of peace exclaim:\r\n\r\n4  At midnight in a cave in Bethlehem the Prince of Peace is born.\r\n\r\n5  And shepherds still were there, and sheep still fed upon the hills.\r\n\r\n6  And in the valley near great flocks of snow-white doves were flying\r\nto and fro.\r\n\r\n7  And when the shepherds knew that Jesus, whom the people called the\r\nking, had come, they came from near and far to speak to him.\r\n\r\n8  And Jesus said to them, Behold the life of innocence and peace!\r\n\r\n9  White is the symbol of the virtuous and pure! the lamb of innocence;\r\nthe dove of peace;\r\n\r\n10  And it was meet that love should come in human form amid such\r\nscenes as these.\r\n\r\n11  Our father Abraham walked through these vales, and on these very\r\nhills he watched his flocks and herds.\r\n\r\n12  And here it was that one, the Prince of Peace, the king of Salim,\r\ncame; the Christ in human form; a greater far than Abraham was he.\r\n\r\n13  And here it was that Abraham gave to this king of Salim, tithes of\r\nall he had.\r\n\r\n14  This Prince of Peace went forth in battle everywhere. He had no\r\nsword; no armor of defence; no weapons of offence;\r\n\r\n15  And yet he conquered men, and nations trembled at his feet.\r\n\r\n16  The hosts of Egypt quailed before this sturdy king of right; the\r\nkings of Egypt placed their crowns upon his head,\r\n\r\n17  And gave into his hands the scepter of all Egypt land, and not a\r\ndrop of blood was shed, and not a captive placed in chains;\r\n\r\n18  But everywhere the conqueror threw wide the prison doors and set\r\nthe captives free.\r\n\r\n19  And, once again, the Prince of Peace has come, and from these\r\nblessed hills he goes again to fight.\r\n\r\n20  And he is clothed in white; his sword is truth; his shield is\r\nfaith; his helmet innocence; his breath is love; his watchword peace.\r\n\r\n21  But this is not a carnal war; it is not man at war with man; but it\r\nis right against the wrong.\r\n\r\n22  And love is captain, love is warrior, love is armor, love is all,\r\nand love shall win.\r\n\r\n23  And then again the hills of Bethlehem were clothed with light;\r\nagain the messenger exclaimed,\r\n\r\n24  Peace, peace on earth, good will to men.\r\n\r\n25  And Jesus taught the people; healed the sick; revealed the\r\nmysteries of the kingdom of the Holy One.\r\n\r\n26  And many said, He is the Christ; the king who was to come has come;\r\nPraise God.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 77.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus in Hebron. Goes to Bethany. Advises Ruth regarding\r\n      certain family troubles._\r\n\r\nWith three disciples Jesus went to Hebron where he tarried seven days\r\nand taught.\r\n\r\n2  And then he went to Bethany and in the home of Lazarus he taught.\r\n\r\n3  The evening came; the multitudes were gone, and Jesus, Lazarus, and\r\nhis sisters, Martha, Ruth and Mary, were alone.\r\n\r\n4  And Ruth was sore distressed. Her home was down in Jericho; her\r\nhusband was the keeper of an inn; his name was Asher-ben.\r\n\r\n5  Now, Asher was a Pharisee of strictest mien and thought, and he\r\nregarded Jesus with disdain.\r\n\r\n6  And when his wife confessed her faith in Christ, he drove her from\r\nhis home.\r\n\r\n7  But Ruth resisted not; she said, If Jesus is the Christ he knows the\r\nway, and I am sure he is the Christ,\r\n\r\n8  My husband may become enraged and slay my human form; he cannot\r\nkill the soul, and in the many mansions of my Fatherland I have a\r\ndwelling-place.\r\n\r\n9  And Ruth told Jesus all; and then she said, What shall I do?\r\n\r\n10  And Jesus said, Your husband is not willingly at fault; he is\r\ndevout; he prays to God, our Father-God.\r\n\r\n11  His zeal for his religion is intense; in this he is sincere; but\r\nit has driven him insane, and he believes it right to keep his home\r\nunsullied by the heresy of Christ.\r\n\r\n12  He feels assured that he has done the will of God in driving you\r\naway.\r\n\r\n13  Intolerance is ignorance matured.\r\n\r\n14  The light will come to him some day, and then he will repay for all\r\nyour heartaches, griefs and tears.\r\n\r\n15  And Ruth, you must not think that you are free from blame.\r\n\r\n16  If you had walked in wisdom’s ways, and been content to hold your\r\npeace, this grief would not have come to you.\r\n\r\n17  It takes a long, long time for light to break into the shell of\r\nprejudice, and patience is the lesson you have need to learn.\r\n\r\n18  The constant dropping of the water wears away the hardest stone.\r\n\r\n19  The sweet and holy incense of a godly life will melt intolerance\r\nmuch quicker than the hottest flame, or hardest blow.\r\n\r\n20  Just wait a little time, and then go home with sympathy and love.\r\nTalk not of Christ, nor of the kingdom of the Holy One.\r\n\r\n21  Just live a godly life; refrain from harshness in your speech, and\r\nyou will lead your husband to the light.\r\n\r\n22  And it was so.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 78.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus in Jericho. Heals a servant of Asher. Goes to the Jordan\r\n      and speaks to the people. Establishes baptism as a pledge of\r\n      discipleship.

Come unto me; the Christine gate is\r\nopened up; turn from your sins and be baptized, and you shall enter\r\nthrough the gate and see the king.\r\n\r\n13  The six disciples who had followed Jesus stood a-near, and Jesus\r\nled them forth and in the Jordan he baptized them in the name of\r\nChrist; and then he said to them,\r\n\r\n14  My friends, you are the first to enter through the Christine gate\r\ninto the kingdom of the Holy One.\r\n\r\n15  As I baptized you in the name of Christ, so you shall, in that\r\nsacred name, baptize all men and women who will confess their faith in\r\nChrist, and shall renounce their sins.\r\n\r\n16  And, lo, the multitudes came down, renounced their sins, confessed\r\ntheir faith in Christ, and were baptized.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 79.\r\n\r\n    _John, the harbinger, at Salim. A lawyer inquires about Jesus.\r\n      John explains to the multitude the mission of Jesus._\r\n\r\nNow, John the harbinger, was at the Salim Springs where water was\r\nabundant, and there he preached and washed the bodies of the people\r\nwho confessed their sins.\r\n\r\n2  A Jewish lawyer went to John and said, Has not this man from\r\nGalilee, he whom you washed and called the Christ, become your foe?\r\n\r\n3  They say that he is at the Jordan ford; that he is building up a\r\nchurch, or something else, and that he washes people, just as you have\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n4  And John replied, This Jesus is indeed the Christ whose way I came\r\nto pave. He is not foe of mine.\r\n\r\n5  The bridegroom hath the bride; his friends are near, and when they\r\nhear his voice they all rejoice.\r\n\r\n6  The kingdom of the Holy One is bride, and Christ the groom; and I,\r\nthe harbinger, am full of joy because they prosper so abundantly.\r\n\r\n7  I have performed the work that I was sent to do; the work of Jesus\r\njust begins.\r\n\r\n8  Then turning to the multitudes he said, Christ is the king of\r\nrighteousness; Christ is the love of God; yea, he is God; one of the\r\nholy persons of the Triune God.\r\n\r\n9  Christ lives in every heart of purity.\r\n\r\n10  Now, Jesus who is preaching at the Jordan ford, has been subjected\r\nto the hardest tests of human life, and he has conquered all the\r\nappetites and passions of the carnal man.\r\n\r\n11  And by the highest court of heaven, has been declared a man of such\r\nsuperior purity and holiness that he can demonstrate the presence of\r\nthe Christ on earth.\r\n\r\n12  Lo, love divine, which is the Christ, abides in him, and he is\r\npattern for the race.\r\n\r\n13  And every man can see in him what every man will be when he has\r\nconquered all the passions of the selfish self.\r\n\r\n14  In water I have washed the bodies of the people who have turned\r\nfrom sin, symbolic of the cleansing of the soul;\r\n\r\n15  But Jesus bathes forever in the living waters of the Holy Breath.\r\n\r\n16  And Jesus comes to bring the savior of the world to men; Love is\r\nthe savior of the world.\r\n\r\n17  And all who put their trust in Christ, and follow Jesus as a\r\npattern and a guide, have everlasting life.\r\n\r\n18  But they who do not trust the Christ, and will not purify their\r\nhearts so that the Christ can dwell within, can never enter life.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 80.\r\n\r\n    _Lamaas comes from India to see Jesus. He listens to the\r\n      teachings of John at Salim. John tells him of the divine\r\n      mission of Jesus. Lamaas finds Jesus at the Jordan. The\r\n      masters recognize each other._\r\n\r\nLamaas, priest of Brahm, who was a friend of Jesus when he was in the\r\ntemple Jagannath, had heard of Jesus and his mighty works in many\r\nlands; and he had left his home and come to Palestine in search of him.\r\n\r\n2  And as he journeyed towards Jerusalem he heard of John, the\r\nharbinger, who was esteemed a prophet of the living God.\r\n\r\n3  Lamaas found the harbinger at Salim Springs; for many days he was a\r\nsilent listener to the pungent truths he taught.\r\n\r\n4  And he was present when the Pharisee told John of Jesus and his\r\nmighty works.\r\n\r\n5  He heard the answer of the harbinger; he heard him bless the name of\r\nJesus, whom he called the Christ.\r\n\r\n6  And then he spoke to John; he said, Pray, tell me more about this\r\nJesus whom you call the Christ.\r\n\r\n7  And John replied, this Jesus is the love of God made manifest.\r\n\r\n8  Lo, men are living on the lower planes--the planes of greed and\r\nselfishness; for self they fight; they conquer with the sword.\r\n\r\n9  In every land the strong enslave and kill the weak. All kingdoms\r\nrise by force of arms; for force is king.\r\n\r\n10  This Jesus comes to overthrow this iron rule of force, and seat\r\nLove on the throne of power.\r\n\r\n11  And Jesus fears no man. He preaches boldly in the courts of kings,\r\nand everywhere, that victories won by force of arms are crimes;\r\n\r\n12  That every worthy end may be attained by gentleness and love, just\r\nas the Prince of Peace, Melchisedec, the priest of God, won gallant\r\nvictories in war without the shedding of a drop of blood.\r\n\r\n13  You ask where are the temples of the Christ? He ministers at\r\nshrines not made with hands; his temples are the hearts of holy men\r\nwho are prepared to see the king.\r\n\r\n14  The groves of nature are his synagogues; his forum is the world.\r\n\r\n15  He has no priests dressed up in puppet style to be admired by men;\r\nfor every son of man is priest of Love.\r\n\r\n16  When man has purified his heart by faith, he needs no middle man to\r\nintercede.\r\n\r\n17  He is on friendly terms with God; is not afraid of him, and he is\r\nable, and is bold enough, to lay his body on the altar of the Lord.\r\n\r\n18  Thus every man is priest, and is himself a living sacrifice.\r\n\r\n19  You need not seek the Christ, for when your heart is purified the\r\nChrist will come, and will abide with you forevermore.\r\n\r\n20  And then Lamaas journeyed on; he came to Jesus as he taught beside\r\nthe ford.\r\n\r\n21  And Jesus said, Behold the Star of India!\r\n\r\n22  Lamaas said, Behold the Sun of Righteousness! And he confessed his\r\nfaith in Christ, and followed him.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 81.\r\n\r\n    _The Christines journey toward Galilee.

They traffic not; then why ask\r\nme the favor of a drink?\r\n\r\n6  And Jesus said Samaritans and Jews are all the children of one God,\r\nour Father-God, and they are kin.\r\n\r\n7  It is but prejudice born of the carnal mind that breeds this enmity\r\nand hate.\r\n\r\n8  While I was born a Jew I recognize the brotherhood of life.\r\nSamaritans are just as dear to me as Jew or Greek.\r\n\r\n9  And then had you but known the blessings that our Father-God has\r\nsent to men by me, you would have asked me for a drink,\r\n\r\n10  And I would glad have given you a cup of water from the Fount of\r\nLife, and you would never thirst again.\r\n\r\n11  The woman said, This well is deep, and you have naught with which\r\nto draw; how could you get the water that you speak about?\r\n\r\n12  And Jesus said, The water that I speak about comes not from Jacob’s\r\nwell; it flows from springs that never fail.\r\n\r\n13  Lo, every one who drinks from Jacob’s well will thirst again; but\r\nthey who drink the water that I give will never thirst again;\r\n\r\n14  For they themselves become a well, and from their inner parts the\r\nsparkling waters bubble up into eternal life.\r\n\r\n15  The woman said, Sir, I would drink from that rich well of life.\r\nGive me to drink, that I may thirst no more.\r\n\r\n16  And Jesus said, Go call your husband from the town that he may\r\nshare with you this living cup.\r\n\r\n17  The woman said, I have no husband, sir.\r\n\r\n18  And Jesus answered her and said, You scarcely know what husband\r\nmeans; you seem to be a gilded butterfly that flits from flower to\r\nflower,\r\n\r\n19  To you there is no sacredness in marriage ties, and you affinitize\r\nwith any man.\r\n\r\n20  And you have lived with five of them who were esteemed as husbands\r\nby your friends.\r\n\r\n21  The woman said, Do I not speak unto a prophet and a seer? Will you\r\nnot condescend to tell me who you are?\r\n\r\n22  And Jesus said, I need not tell you who I am for you have read the\r\nLaw, the Prophets and the Psalms that tell of me,\r\n\r\n23  I am one come to break away the wall that separates the sons of\r\nmen. In Holy Breath there is no Greek, nor Jew, and no Samaritan; no\r\nbond, nor free; for all are one.\r\n\r\n24  The woman asked, Why do you say that only in Jerusalem men ought to\r\npray, and that they should not worship in our holy mount?\r\n\r\n25  And Jesus said, What you have said, I do not say. One place is just\r\nas sacred as another place.\r\n\r\n26  The hour has come when men must worship God within the temple of\r\nthe heart; for God is not within Jerusalem, nor in your holy mount in\r\nany way that he is not in every heart.\r\n\r\n27  Our God is Spirit; they who worship him must worship him in spirit\r\nand in truth.\r\n\r\n28  The woman said, We know that when Messiah comes that he will lead\r\nus in the ways of truth.\r\n\r\n29  And Jesus said, Behold the Christ has come; Messiah speaks to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 82.\r\n\r\n    _While Jesus is teaching, his disciples come and marvel because\r\n      he speaks with a Samaritan. Many people from Sychar come to\r\n      see Jesus. He speaks to them. With his disciples he goes to\r\n      Sychar and remains for certain days._\r\n\r\nWhile Jesus yet was talking to the woman at the well, the six\r\ndisciples came from Sychar with the food.\r\n\r\n2  And when they saw him talking to a woman of Samaria, and one they\r\nthought a courtesan, they were amazed; yet no one asked him why he\r\nspoke with her.\r\n\r\n3  The woman was so lost in thought and so intent on what the master\r\nsaid, that she forgot her errand to the well; she left her pitcher and\r\nran quickly to the town.\r\n\r\n4  She told the people all about the prophet she had met at Jacob’s\r\nwell; she said, He told me every thing I ever did.\r\n\r\n5  And when the people would know more about the man, the woman said,\r\nCome out and see. And multitudes went out to Jacob’s well.\r\n\r\n6  When Jesus saw them come he said to those who followed him, You need\r\nnot say, It is four months before the harvest time;\r\n\r\n7  Behold, the harvest time is now. Lift up your eyes and look; the\r\nfields are golden with the ripened grain.\r\n\r\n8  Lo, many sowers have gone forth to sow the seeds of life; the seed\r\nhas grown; the plants have strengthened in the summer sun; the grain\r\nhas ripened, and the master calls for men to reap.\r\n\r\n9  And you shall go out in the fields and reap what other men have\r\nsown; but when the reckoning day shall come the sowers and the reapers\r\nall together will rejoice.\r\n\r\n10  And Philip said to Jesus, Stay now your work a time and sit beneath\r\nthis olive tree and eat a portion of this food; you must be faint for\r\nyou have eaten naught since early day.\r\n\r\n11  But Jesus said, I am not faint, for I have food to eat you know not\r\nof.\r\n\r\n12  Then the disciples said among themselves, Who could have brought\r\nhim aught to eat?\r\n\r\n13  They did not know that he had power to turn the very ethers into\r\nbread.\r\n\r\n14  And Jesus said, The master of the harvest never sends his reapers\r\nforth and feeds them not.\r\n\r\n15  My Father who has sent me forth into the harvest field of human\r\nlife will never suffer me to want; and when he calls for you to serve,\r\nlo, he will give you food, will clothe and shelter you.\r\n\r\n16  Then turning to the people of Samaria, he said, Think not it\r\nstrange that I, a Jew, should speak to you, for I am one with you.\r\n\r\n17  The universal Christ who was, and is, and evermore shall be, is\r\nmanifest in me; but Christ belongs to every man.\r\n\r\n18  God scatters forth his blessings with a lavish hand, and he is not\r\nmore kind to one than to another one of all the creatures of his hand.\r\n\r\n19  I just came up from Judah’s hills, and God’s same sun was shining\r\nand his flowers were blooming, and in the night his stars were just as\r\nbright as they are here.\r\n\r\n20  God cannot cast a child away; the Jew, the Greek and the Samaritan\r\nare equal in his sight.\r\n\r\n21  And why should men and women fret and quarrel, like children in\r\ntheir plays?\r\n\r\n22  The lines that separate the sons of men are made of straw, and just\r\na single breath of love would blow them all away.\r\n\r\n23  The people were amazed at what the stranger said, and many said,\r\nThe Christ that was to come has surely come.\r\n\r\n24  And Jesus went with them into the town, and tarried certain days.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 83.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus teaches the people of Sychar. Casts a wicked spirit out\r\n      of one obsessed. Sends the spirit to its own place. Heals\r\n      many people. The priests are disturbed by the presence of\r\n      Jesus in Sychar, but he speaks to them and wins their favor._\r\n\r\nIn Sychar Jesus taught the people in the market place.\r\n\r\n2  A man obsessed was brought to him. The wicked spirit that possessed\r\nthe man was full of violence and lust, and often threw his victim to\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n3  And Jesus spoke aloud and said, Base spirit, loose your hold upon\r\nthe vitals of this man, and go back to your own.\r\n\r\n4  And then the spirit begged that he might go into the body of a dog\r\nthat stood near by.\r\n\r\n5  But Jesus said, Why harm the helpless dog? Its life is just as dear\r\nto it as mine to me.\r\n\r\n6  It is not yours to throw the burden of your sin on any living thing.\r\n\r\n7  By your own deeds and evil thoughts you have brought all these\r\nperils on yourself. You have hard problems to be solved; but you must\r\nsolve them for yourself.\r\n\r\n8  By thus obsessing man you make your own conditions doubly sad. Go\r\nback into your own domain; refrain from harming anything, and, by and\r\nby, you will, yourself, be free.\r\n\r\n9  The wicked spirit left the man and went unto his own. The man\r\nlooked up in thankfulness and said, Praise God.\r\n\r\n10  And many of the people brought their sick, and Jesus spoke the\r\nWord, and they were healed.\r\n\r\n11  The ruler of the synagogue, and all the priests were much disturbed\r\nwhen told that Jesus from Jerusalem was preaching in the town.\r\n\r\n12  They thought that he had come to proselyte and stir up strife among\r\nSamaritans.\r\n\r\n13  And so they sent an officer to bring him to the synagogue that he\r\nmight give a reason for his presence in the town.\r\n\r\n14  But Jesus said to him who came, Go back and tell the priests and\r\nruler of the synagogue that I am not engaged in crime.\r\n\r\n15  I come to bind up broken hearts, to heal the sick, and cast the\r\nevil spirits out of those obsessed.\r\n\r\n16  Tell them, their prophets spoke of me; that I am come to break no\r\nlaw, but to fulfil the highest law.\r\n\r\n17  The man returned and told the priests and ruler of the synagogue\r\nwhat Jesus said,\r\n\r\n18  The ruler was amazed, and with the priests went to the market place\r\nwhere Jesus was.\r\n\r\n19  And when he saw them, Jesus said, Behold the honored men of all\r\nSamaria! the men ordained to lead the people in the way of right.\r\n\r\n20  And I am come to help, and not to hinder in their work.\r\n\r\n21  There are two classes of the sons of men; they who would build the\r\nhuman race upon the sure foundation stones of justice, truth, equality\r\nand right,\r\n\r\n22  And they who would destroy the holy temple where the Spirit dwells\r\nand bring their fellows down to beggary and crime.\r\n\r\n23  The holy brotherhood of right must stand united in the stirring\r\nconflicts of the hour.\r\n\r\n24  No matter whether they be Jews, Samaritans, Assyrians or Greeks,\r\nthey must tramp down beneath their feet all strife, all discord,\r\njealousy and hate, and demonstrate the brotherhood of man.\r\n\r\n25  Then to the ruler of the synagogue he spoke: he said, United in the\r\ncause of right we stand; divided we will fall.\r\n\r\n26  And then he took the ruler by the hand; a love light filled their\r\nsouls; and all the people were amazed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 84.\r\n\r\n    _The Christines resume their journey. They tarry a while in the\r\n      city of Samaria. Jesus speaks in the synagogue. Heals a woman\r\n      by mental power. He disappears, but later joins his disciples\r\n      as they journey toward Nazareth._\r\n\r\nThe Christines turned their faces toward the land of Galilee; but when\r\nthey reached the city of Samaria, the multitudes pressed hard about\r\nthem, begging them to tarry in their city for a while.\r\n\r\n2  And then they went up to the synagogue, and Jesus opened up the book\r\nof Moses, and he read:\r\n\r\n3  In thee and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blest.\r\n\r\n4  And then he closed the book and said, These words were spoken by the\r\nLord of hosts unto our father Abraham, and Israel has been blessedness\r\nto all the world.\r\n\r\n5  We are his seed; but not a tithe of the great work that we were\r\ncalled to do has yet been done.\r\n\r\n6  The Lord of hosts has set apart the Israelites to teach the unity\r\nof God and man; but one can never teach that which he does not\r\ndemonstrate in life.\r\n\r\n7  Our God is Spirit, and in him all wisdom, love and strength abide.\r\n\r\n8  In every man these sacred attributes are budding forth, and in due\r\ntime they will unfold; the demonstration will completed be, and man\r\nwill comprehend the fact of unity.\r\n\r\n9  And you, the ruler of the synagogue, and you, these priests, are\r\nhonored servants of the Lord of hosts.\r\n\r\n10  All men are looking unto you for guidance in the ways of life;\r\nexample is another name for priest; so what you would that people be,\r\nthat you must be.\r\n\r\n11  A simple godly life may win ten thousand souls to purity and right.\r\n\r\n12  And all the people said, Amen.\r\n\r\n13  Then Jesus left the synagogue, and at the hour of evening prayer\r\nhe went up to the sacred grove, and all the people turned their faces\r\ntoward their holy mount and prayed.\r\n\r\n14  And Jesus prayed.\r\n\r\n15  And as he sat in silent mood a voice of soul spoke to his soul\r\nimploring help.\r\n\r\n16  And Jesus saw a woman on a couch in sore distress; for she was sick\r\nnigh unto death.\r\n\r\n17  She could not speak, but she had heard that Jesus was a man of God,\r\nand in her heart she called on him for help.\r\n\r\n18  And Jesus helped; he did not speak; but like a flash of light, a\r\nmighty virtue from his soul filled full the body of the dying one, and\r\nshe arose, and joined her kindred while they prayed.\r\n\r\n19  Her kindred were astonished and they said to her, How were you\r\nhealed? And she replied,\r\n\r\n20  I do not know; I simply asked the man of God in thought for healing\r\npower, and in a moment I was well.\r\n\r\n21  The people said, The gods have surely come to earth; for man has\r\nnot the power to heal by thought.\r\n\r\n22  But Jesus said, The greatest power in heaven and earth is thought.\r\n\r\n23  God made the universe by thought; he paints the lily and the rose\r\nwith thought.\r\n\r\n24  Why think it strange that I should send a healing thought and\r\nchange the ethers of disease and death to those of health and life?\r\n\r\n25  Lo, you shall see far greater things than this, for by the power\r\nof holy thought, my body will be changed from carnal flesh to spirit\r\nform; and so will yours.\r\n\r\n26  When Jesus had thus said he disappeared, and no one saw him go.\r\n\r\n27  His own disciples did not comprehend the change; they knew not\r\nwhere their master went, and they went on their way.\r\n\r\n28  But as they walked and talked about the strange event, lo, Jesus\r\ncame and walked with them to Nazareth of Galilee.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 85.\r\n\r\n    _John, the harbinger, censures Herod for his wickedness.\r\n      Herod sends him to prison in Machaerus. Jesus tells why God\r\n      permitted the imprisonment of John._\r\n\r\nHerod Antipas, the tetrarch of Paraca and of Galilee was dissipated,\r\nselfish and tyrannical.\r\n\r\n2  He drove his wife away from home that he might take as wife\r\nHerodias, the wife of one, a near of kin, a woman, like himself,\r\nimmoral and unjust.\r\n\r\n3  The city of Tiberius, upon the shores of Galilee, was Herod’s home.\r\n\r\n4  Now John, the harbinger, had left the Salim Springs to teach the\r\npeople by the sea of Galilee; and he rebuked the wicked ruler and his\r\nstolen wife for all their sins.\r\n\r\n5  Herodias was enraged because the preacher dared accuse her and her\r\nhusband of their crimes;\r\n\r\n6  And she prevailed on Herod to arrest the harbinger and cast him in a\r\ndungeon in the castle of Machaerus that stood beside the Bitter Sea.\r\n\r\n7  And Herod did as she required; then she lived in peace in all her\r\nsins, for none were bold enough to censure her again.\r\n\r\n8  The followers of John were warned to speak not of the trial and\r\nimprisonment of John.\r\n\r\n9  By order of the court, they were restrained from teaching in the\r\npublic halls.\r\n\r\n10  They could not talk about this better life that Herod called, the\r\nHeresy of John.\r\n\r\n11  When it was known that John had been imprisoned by the tetrarch\r\ncourt, the friends of Jesus thought it best that he should not remain\r\nin Galilee.\r\n\r\n12  But Jesus said, I have no need of fear; my time has not yet come;\r\nno man can stay me till my work is done.\r\n\r\n13  And when they asked why God permitted Herod to imprison John, he\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n14  Behold yon stalk of wheat! When it has brought the grain to\r\nperfectness, it is of no more worth; it falls, becoming part of earth\r\nagain from which it came.\r\n\r\n15  John is a stalk of golden wheat; he brought unto maturity the\r\nrichest grain of all the earth; his work is done.\r\n\r\n16  If he had said another word it might have marred the symmetry of\r\nwhat is now a noble life.\r\n\r\n17  And when my work is done the rulers will do unto me what they have\r\ndone to John, and more.\r\n\r\n18  All these events are part of God’s own plan. The innocent will\r\nsuffer while the wicked are in power; but woe to them who cause the\r\nsuffering of the innocents.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 86.\r\n\r\n    _The Christines are in Nazareth. Jesus speaks in the synagogue.\r\n      He offends the people and they attempt to kill him. He\r\n      mysteriously disappears, and returns to the synagogue._\r\n\r\nThe Christines were in Nazareth. It was the Sabbath day, and Jesus\r\nwent up to the synagogue.\r\n\r\n2  The keeper of the books gave one to Jesus and he opened it and read:\r\n\r\n3  The Spirit of the Lord has overshadowed me; he has anointed me to\r\npreach the gospel to the poor; to set the captives free; to open\r\nsightless eyes;\r\n\r\n4  To bring relief to those oppressed and bruised, and to proclaim, The\r\nyear of jubilee has come.\r\n\r\n5  When he had read these words he closed the book and said, This\r\nscripture is fulfilled before your eyes this day. The year of jubilee\r\nhas come; the time when Israel shall bless the world.\r\n\r\n6  And then he told them many things about the kingdom of the Holy\r\nOne; about the hidden way of life; about forgiveness of sins.\r\n\r\n7  Now, many people knew not who the speaker was: And others said, Is\r\nnot this Joseph’s son? Does not his mother live on Marmion Way?\r\n\r\n8  And one spoke out and said, This is the man who did such mighty\r\nworks in Cana, in Capernaum and in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n9  And then the people said, Physician heal yourself. Do here among\r\nyour kindred all the mighty works that you have done in other towns.\r\n\r\n10  And Jesus said, No prophet is received with honor by the people of\r\nhis native land; and prophets are not sent to every one.\r\n\r\n11  Elijah was a man of God; he had the power and he closed the gates\r\nof heaven, and it did not rain for forty months; and when he spoke the\r\nWord, the rain came on, the earth brought forth again.\r\n\r\n12  And there were many widows in the land; but this Elijah went to\r\nnone but Zarephath, and she was blessed.\r\n\r\n13  And when Elisha lived, lo, many lepers were in Israel, but none\r\nwere cleansed save one--the Syrian who had faith.\r\n\r\n14  You have no faith; you seek for signs to satisfy your curious\r\nwhims; but you shall see not till you open up your eyes of faith.\r\n\r\n15  And then the people were enraged; they rushed upon him, bound him\r\ndown with cords, and took him to a precipice not far away, intent to\r\ncast him down to death;\r\n\r\n16  But when they thought they held him fast, he disappeared; unseen he\r\npassed among the angry men, and went his way.\r\n\r\n17  The people were confounded and they said, What manner of a man is\r\nthis?\r\n\r\n18  And when they came again to Nazareth, they found him teaching in\r\nthe synagogue.\r\n\r\n19  They troubled him no more for they were sore afraid.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 87.\r\n\r\n    _The Christines go to Cana.

He announces his intention to choose twelve\r\n      apostles._\r\n\r\nIn Nazareth Jesus taught no more; he went with his disciples up to\r\nCana, where, at a marriage feast, he once turned water into wine.\r\n\r\n2  And here he met a man of noble birth whose home was in Capernaum,\r\nwhose son was sick.\r\n\r\n3  The man had faith in Jesus’ power to heal, and when he learned that\r\nhe had come to Galilee he went in haste to meet him on the way.\r\n\r\n4  The man met Jesus at the seventh hour, and he entreated him to\r\nhasten to Capernaum to save his son.\r\n\r\n5  But Jesus did not go; he stood aside in silence for a time, and then\r\nhe said, Your faith has proved a healing balm; your son is well.\r\n\r\n6  The man believed and went his way toward Capernaum and as he went he\r\nmet a servant from his home who said,\r\n\r\n7  My lord, You need not haste; your son is well.\r\n\r\n8  The father asked, When did my son begin to mend?\r\n\r\n9  The servant said, On yesterday about the seventh hour the fever left.\r\n\r\n10  And then the father knew it was the healing balm that Jesus sent\r\nthat saved his son.\r\n\r\n11  In Cana Jesus tarried not; he went his way with his disciples to\r\nCapernaum, where he secured a spacious house where, with his mother,\r\nhe could live; where his disciples might repair to hear the Word.\r\n\r\n12  He called the men who had confessed their faith in him to meet him\r\nin his home, which his disciples called, The school of Christ; and\r\nwhen they came he said to them,\r\n\r\n13  This gospel of the Christ must be proclaimed in all the world.\r\n\r\n14  This Christine vine will be a mighty vine whose branches will\r\ncomprise the peoples, tribes and tongues of all the earth.\r\n\r\n15  I am the vine; twelve men shall be the branches of the stock, and\r\nthese shall send forth branches everywhere;\r\n\r\n16  And from among the people who have followed me, the Holy Breath\r\nwill call the twelve.\r\n\r\n17  Go now and do your work as you have done your work; but listen for\r\nthe call.\r\n\r\n18  Then the disciples went unto their daily tasks, to do their work as\r\nthey had done, and Jesus went alone into the Hammoth hills to pray.\r\n\r\n19  Three days and nights he spent communing with the Silent\r\nBrotherhood; then, in the power of Holy Breath he came to call the\r\ntwelve.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 88.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus walks by the sea. Stands in a fishing boat and speaks to\r\n      the people. Under his direction the fishermen secure a great\r\n      catch of fish. He selects and calls his twelve apostles._\r\n\r\nBeside the sea of Galilee the Christine master walked, and multitudes\r\nof people followed him.\r\n\r\n2  The fishing boats had just come in, and Peter and his brother waited\r\nin their boats; their helpers were ashore repairing broken nets.\r\n\r\n3  And Jesus went into a boat and Peter pushed it out a little ways\r\nfrom shore; and Jesus standing in the boat spoke to the multitude. He\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n4  Isaiah, prophet of the Lord of hosts, looked forward and he saw this\r\nday; he saw the people standing by the sea, and he exclaimed,\r\n\r\n5  The land of Zebulon and Napthali, land beyond the Jordan and toward\r\nthe sea, the Gentile Galilee,\r\n\r\n6  The people were in darkness, knowing not the way; but, lo, they saw\r\nthe Day Star rise; a light streamed forth; they saw the way of life;\r\nthey walked therein.\r\n\r\n7  And you are blest beyond all people of the earth today, because you\r\nfirst may see the light, and may become the children of the light.\r\n\r\n8  Then Jesus said to Peter, Bring your nets aboard, and put out in the\r\ndeep,\r\n\r\n9  And Peter did as Jesus bade him do; but in a faithless way he said,\r\nThis is a useless trip; there are no fish upon this shore of Galilee\r\ntoday; with Andrew I have toiled all night, and taken naught.\r\n\r\n10  But Jesus saw beneath the surface of the sea; he saw a multitude of\r\nfish. He said to Peter,\r\n\r\n11  Cast out your net upon the right side of the boat.\r\n\r\n12  And Peter did as Jesus said, and, lo, the net was filled; it scarce\r\nwas strong enough to hold the multitude of fish.\r\n\r\n13  And Peter called to John and James, who were near by, for help; and\r\nwhen the net was hauled to boat, both boats were well nigh filled\r\nwith fish.\r\n\r\n14  When Peter saw the heavy catch, he was ashamed of what he said;\r\nashamed because he had no faith, and he fell down at Jesus’ feet and\r\nsaid, Lord, I believe!\r\n\r\n15  And Jesus said, Behold the catch! from henceforth you shall fish no\r\nmore for fish;\r\n\r\n16  You shall cast forth the Christine net into the sea of human life,\r\nupon the right side of the boat; you shall ensnare the multitudes to\r\nholiness and blessedness and peace.\r\n\r\n17  Now, when they reached the shore the Christine master called to\r\nPeter, Andrew, James and John and said,\r\n\r\n18  You fishermen of Galilee, the masters have a mighty work for us to\r\ndo; I go, and you may follow me. And they left all and followed him.\r\n\r\n19  And Jesus walked along the shore, and seeing Philip and Nathaniel\r\nwalking on the beach he said to them,\r\n\r\n20  You teachers of Bethsaida, who long have taught the people Greek\r\nphilosophy, the masters have a higher work for you and me to do; I go\r\nand you may follow me; and then they followed him.\r\n\r\n21  A little farther on there stood a Roman tribute house, and Jesus\r\nsaw the officer in charge; his name was Matthew, who once abode in\r\nJericho;\r\n\r\n22  The youth who once ran on before the Lord into Jerusalem and said,\r\nBehold the Christines come.\r\n\r\n23  And Matthew was a man of wealth, and learned in wisdom of the Jews,\r\nthe Syrians and the Greeks.\r\n\r\n24  And Jesus said to him, Hail, Matthew, trusted servant of the\r\nCæsars, hail! the masters call us to the tribute house of souls; I go\r\nand you may follow me. And Matthew followed him.\r\n\r\n25  Ischariot and his son, whose name was Judas, were employed by\r\nMatthew and were at the tribute house.\r\n\r\n26  And Jesus said to Judas, Stay your work; the masters call us to a\r\nduty in the savings bank of souls; I go and you may follow me. And\r\nJudas followed him.\r\n\r\n27  And Jesus met a lawyer who had heard about the Christine master and\r\nhad come from Antioch to study in the school of Christ.\r\n\r\n28  This man was Thomas, man of doubt, and yet a Greek philosopher of\r\nculture and of power.\r\n\r\n29  But Jesus saw in him the lines of faith, and said to him, The\r\nmasters have a need of men who can interpret law; I go, and you may\r\nfollow me. And Thomas followed him.\r\n\r\n30  And when the evening came and Jesus was at home, behold, there came\r\nhis kindred, James and Jude, the sons of Alpheus and Miriam.\r\n\r\n31  And these were men of faith, and they were carpenters of Nazareth.\r\n\r\n32  And Jesus said to them, Behold, for you have toiled with me, and\r\nwith my father Joseph, building houses for the homes of men. The\r\nmasters call us now to aid in building homes for souls; homes built\r\nwithout the sound of hammer, ax, or saw;\r\n\r\n33  I go, and you may follow me. And James and Jude exclaimed, Lord, we\r\nwill follow you.\r\n\r\n34  And on the morrow Jesus sent a message unto Simon, leader of the\r\nZelotes, a strict exponent of the Jewish law.\r\n\r\n35  And in the message Jesus said, The masters call for men to\r\ndemonstrate the faith of Abraham; I go, and you may follow me. And\r\nSimon followed him.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 89.\r\n\r\n    _The twelve apostles are at Jesus’ home and are consecrated to\r\n      their work. Jesus instructs them. He goes to the synagogue on\r\n      the Sabbath and teaches. He casts an unclean spirit out of\r\n      one obsessed. He heals Peter’s mother-in-law._\r\n\r\nNow, on the day before the Sabbath day, the twelve disciples who had\r\nreceived the call were met with one accord in Jesus’ home.\r\n\r\n2  And Jesus said to them, This is the day to consecrate yourselves\r\nunto the work of God; so let us pray.\r\n\r\n3  Turn from the outer to the inner self; close all the doors of carnal\r\nself and wait.\r\n\r\n4  The Holy Breath will fill this place, and you will be baptized in\r\nHoly Breath.\r\n\r\n5  And then they prayed; a light more brilliant than the noonday sun\r\nfilled all the room, and tongues of flame from every head rose high in\r\nair.\r\n\r\n6  The atmosphere of Galilee was set astir; a sound like distant\r\nthunder rolled above Capernaum, and men heard songs, as though ten\r\nthousand angels joined in full accord.\r\n\r\n7  And then the twelve disciples heard a voice, a still, small voice,\r\nand just one word was said, a word they dared not speak; it was the\r\nsacred name of God.\r\n\r\n8  And Jesus said to them, By this omnific Word you may control the\r\nelements, and all the powers of air.\r\n\r\n9  And when within your souls you speak this Word, you have the keys\r\nof life and death; of things that are; of things that were; of things\r\nthat are to be.\r\n\r\n10  Behold you are the twelve great branches of the Christine vine; the\r\ntwelve foundation stones; the twelve apostles of the Christ.\r\n\r\n11  As lambs I send you forth among wild beasts; but the omnific Word\r\nwill be your buckler and your shield.\r\n\r\n12  And then again the air was filled with song, and every living\r\ncreature seemed to say, Praise God! Amen!\r\n\r\n13  The next day was the Sabbath day; and Jesus went with his disciples\r\nto the synagogue, and there he taught.\r\n\r\n14  The people said, He teaches not as do the scribes and Pharisees;\r\nbut as a man who knows, and has authority to speak.\r\n\r\n15  As Jesus spoke, a man obsessed came in; the evil spirits that\r\nobsessed the man were of the baser sort; they often threw their victim\r\nto the ground, or in the fire.\r\n\r\n16  And when the spirits saw the Christine master in the synagogue they\r\nknew him, and they said,\r\n\r\n17  You son of God, why are you here? would you destroy us by the Word\r\nbefore our time? we would have naught to do with you; let us alone.\r\n\r\n18  But Jesus said to them, By the omnific Word I speak; Come out;\r\ntorment this man no more; go to your place.\r\n\r\n19  And then the unclean spirits threw the man upon the floor, and,\r\nwith a fiendish cry, they went away.\r\n\r\n20  And Jesus lifted up the man and said to him, If you will keep your\r\nmind full occupied with good, the evil spirits cannot find a place to\r\nstay;\r\n\r\n21  They only come to empty heads and hearts. Go on your way and sin no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n22  The people were astonished at the words that Jesus spoke, the work\r\nhe did. They asked among themselves,\r\n\r\n23  Who is this man? From whence comes all this power that even unclean\r\nspirits fear, and flee away?\r\n\r\n24  The Christine master left the synagogue; with Peter, Andrew, James\r\nand John, he went to Peter’s house where one, a near of kin, was sick.\r\n\r\n25  And Peter’s wife came in; it was her mother who was sick.\r\n\r\n26  And Jesus touched the woman as she lay upon her couch; he spoke the\r\nWord; the fever ceased and she arose and ministered to them.\r\n\r\n27  The neighbors heard what had occurred, and then they brought their\r\nsick, and those obsessed, and Jesus laid his hands on them, and they\r\nwere healed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 90.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus goes alone to a mountain to pray. His disciples find\r\n      him. He calls the twelve and they journey through Galilee\r\n      teaching and healing. At Tiberius Jesus heals a leper. The\r\n      Christines return to Capernaum. In his own home Jesus heals a\r\n      palsied man and makes known the philosophy of healing and the\r\n      forgiveness of sins._\r\n\r\nThe Christine master disappeared; no one saw him go, and Peter,\r\nJames and John set forth to search for him; they found him at his\r\ntrysting-place out on the Hammoth hills.\r\n\r\n2  And Peter said, The city of Capernaum is wild; the people crowd the\r\nstreets and every public place is filled.\r\n\r\n3  The men, the women and the children everywhere are asking for the\r\nman who heals by will.\r\n\r\n4  Your home and our homes are filled with people who are sick; they\r\ncall for Jesus who is called the Christ. What will we say to them?\r\n\r\n5  And Jesus said, A score of other cities call, and we must take the\r\nbread of life to them. Go call the other men and let us go.\r\n\r\n6  And Jesus and the twelve went to Bethsaida where Philip and\r\nNathaniel dwelt; and there they taught.\r\n\r\n7  The multitudes believed on Christ, confessed their sins and were\r\nbaptized, and came into the kingdom of the Holy One.\r\n\r\n8  The Christine master and the twelve went everywhere through all the\r\ntowns of Galilee, and taught, baptizing all who came in faith, and who\r\nconfessed their sins.\r\n\r\n9  They opened blinded eyes, unstopped deaf ears, drove forth the evil\r\nones from those obsessed, and healed disease of every kind.\r\n\r\n10  And they were in Tiberius by the sea, and as they taught a leper\r\ncame a-near and said, Lord, I believe, and if you will but speak the\r\nWord I will be clean.\r\n\r\n11  And Jesus said to him, I will; be clean. And soon the leprosy was\r\ngone; the man was clean.\r\n\r\n12  And Jesus charged the man, Say naught to any one, but go and show\r\nyourself unto the priests and offer for your cleansing what the law\r\ndemands.\r\n\r\n13  The man was wild with joy; but then he went not to the priests, but\r\nin the marts of trade, and everywhere he told what had been done.\r\n\r\n14  And then the sick in throngs pressed hard upon the healer and the\r\ntwelve, imploring to be healed.\r\n\r\n15  And they were so importunate that little could be done, and so the\r\nChristines left the crowded thoroughfares, and went to desert places\r\nwhere they taught the multitudes that followed them.\r\n\r\n16  Now, after many days the Christines came back to Capernaum. When it\r\nwas noised around that Jesus was at home, the people came; they filled\r\nthe house till there was no more room, not even at the door.\r\n\r\n17  And there were present scribes and Pharisees and doctors of the law\r\nfrom every part of Galilee, and from Jerusalem, and Jesus opened up\r\nfor them the way of life.\r\n\r\n18  Four men brought one, a palsied man upon a cot, and when they could\r\nnot pass the door they took the sick man to the roof, and opened up a\r\nway, then let him down before the healer’s face.\r\n\r\n19  When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the palsied man, My son,\r\nbe of good cheer; your sins are all forgiven.\r\n\r\n20  And when the scribes and Pharisees heard what he said, they said,\r\nWhy does this man speak thus? who can forgive the sins of men but God?\r\n\r\n21  And Jesus caught their thought; he knew they questioned thus among\r\nthemselves; he said to them,\r\n\r\n22  Why reason thus among yourselves? What matters it if I should say,\r\nYour sins are blotted out; or say, Arise, take up your bed and walk?\r\n\r\n23  But just to prove that men may here forgive the sins of men, I say,\r\n(and then he spoke unto the palsied man),\r\n\r\n24  Arise, take up your bed, and go your way.\r\n\r\n25  And in the presence of them all the man arose, took up his bed, and\r\nwent his way.\r\n\r\n26  The people could not comprehend the things they heard and saw. They\r\nsaid among themselves, This is a day we never can forget; we have seen\r\nwondrous things today.\r\n\r\n27  And when the multitudes had gone the twelve remained, and Jesus\r\nsaid to them,\r\n\r\n28  The Jewish festival draws near; next week we will go to Jerusalem,\r\nthat we may meet our brethren from afar, and open up to them the way\r\nthat they may see the king.\r\n\r\n29  The Christines sought the quiet of their homes, where they remained\r\nin prayer for certain days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XVI.\r\n\r\nAIN.\r\n\r\n_The Second Annual Epoch of the Christine Ministry of Jesus._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 91.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus at the feast in Jerusalem. Heals an impotent man. Gives\r\n      a practical lesson in healing. Affirms that all men are the\r\n      sons of God._\r\n\r\nThe feast time came and Jesus and the twelve went to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n2  Upon the day before the Sabbath day they reached Mount Olives and\r\nthey tarried at an inn before Mount Olives on the north.\r\n\r\n3  And in the early morning of the Sabbath day they went in through the\r\nsheep gate to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n4  The healing fountain of Bethesda, near the gate, was thronged about\r\nwith people who were sick;\r\n\r\n5  For they believed that at a certain time an angel came and poured a\r\nhealing virtue in the pool, and those who entered first and bathed,\r\nwould be made whole.\r\n\r\n6  And Jesus and the twelve were standing near the pool.\r\n\r\n7  And Jesus saw a man near by who had been stricken eight and thirty\r\nyears; without a hand to help he could not move.\r\n\r\n8  And Jesus said to him, My brother, man, would you be healed?\r\n\r\n9  The man replied, I earnestly desire to be healed; but I am helpless\r\nand when the angel comes and pours the healing virtues in the pool,\r\n\r\n10  Another who can walk, steps in the fountain first and I am left\r\nunhealed.\r\n\r\n11  And Jesus said, Who sends an angel here to potentize this pool for\r\njust a favored few?\r\n\r\n12  I know it is not God, for he deals just the same with every one.\r\n\r\n13  One has no better chance in heaven’s healing fountain than another\r\none.\r\n\r\n14  The fount of health is in your soul; it has a door locked fast; the\r\nkey is faith;\r\n\r\n15  And every one can have this key and may unlock the door and plunge\r\ninto the healing fount and be made whole.\r\n\r\n16  And then the man looked up in hopeful mood and said, Give me this\r\nkey of faith.\r\n\r\n17  And Jesus said, Do you believe what I have said? According to your\r\nfaith it shall be done. Arise, take up your bed and walk.\r\n\r\n18  The man at once arose and walked away; he only said, Praise God.\r\n\r\n19  And when the people asked, Who made you whole? the man replied, I\r\ndo not know. A stranger at the pool just spoke a word and I was well.\r\n\r\n20  The many did not see when Jesus healed the man, and with the twelve\r\nhe went his way up to the temple courts.\r\n\r\n21  And in the temple Jesus saw the man and said to him, Behold you are\r\nmade whole; from henceforth guard your life aright;\r\n\r\n22  Go on your way and sin no more, or something worse may fall on you.\r\n\r\n23  And now the man knew who it was who made him whole.\r\n\r\n24  He told the story to the priests and they were much enraged; they\r\nsaid, The law forbids a man to heal upon the Sabbath day.\r\n\r\n25  But Jesus said, My Father works on Sabbath days and may not I?\r\n\r\n26  He sends his rain, his sunshine and his dew; he makes his grass to\r\ngrow, his flowers to bloom; he speeds the harvests just the same on\r\nSabbath days as on the other days.\r\n\r\n27  If it is lawful for the grass to grow and flowers to bloom on\r\nSabbath days it surely is not wrong to succor stricken men.\r\n\r\n28  And then the priests were angered more and more because he claimed\r\nto be a son of God.\r\n\r\n29  A leading priest, Abihu, said, This fellow is a menace to our\r\nnation and our laws; he makes himself to be a son of God; it is not\r\nmeet that he should live.\r\n\r\n30  But Jesus said, Abihu, Sir, you are a learned man; you surely know\r\nthe law of life. Pray tell who were the sons of God we read about in\r\nGenesis, who took to wife the daughters of the sons of men?\r\n\r\n31  Our father Adam; who was he? From whence came he? Had he a father?\r\nor did he fall from heaven as a star?\r\n\r\n32  We read that Moses said, He came from God. If Adam came from God,\r\npray, was he offspring, was he son?\r\n\r\n33  We are the children of this son of God; then tell me, learned\r\npriest, Who are we if not sons of God?\r\n\r\n34  The priest had urgent business and he went his away.\r\n\r\n35  And Jesus said, All men are sons of God and if they live a holy\r\nlife they always are at home with God.\r\n\r\n36  They see and understand the works of God, and in his sacred name\r\nthey can perform these works.\r\n\r\n37  The lightnings and the storms are messengers of God as well as are\r\nthe sunshine, rain and dew.\r\n\r\n38  The virtues of the heavens are in God’s hands, and every loyal son\r\nmay use these virtues and these powers.\r\n\r\n39  Man is the delegate of God to do his will on earth, and man can\r\nheal the sick, control the spirits of the air, and raise the dead.\r\n\r\n40  Because I have the power to do these things is nothing strange. All\r\nmen may gain the power to do these things; but they must conquer all\r\nthe passions of the lower self; and they can conquer if they will.\r\n\r\n41  So man is God on earth, and he who honors God must honor man; for\r\nGod and man are one, as father and the child are one.\r\n\r\n42  Behold, I say, The hour has come; the dead will hear the voice of\r\nman, and live, because the son of man is son of God.\r\n\r\n43  You men of Israel, hear! you live in death; you are locked up\r\nwithin the tomb.\r\n\r\n44  (There is no deeper death than ignorance and unbelief.)\r\n\r\n45  But all will some day hear the voice of God, made plain by voice of\r\nman, and live. You all will know that you are sons of God, and by the\r\nsacred Word, may do the works of God.\r\n\r\n46  When you have come to life, that is, have come to realize that you\r\nare sons of God, you who have lived the life of right, will open up\r\nyour eyes on fields of life.\r\n\r\n47  But you who love the ways of sin will, in this resurrection, stand\r\nbefore a judgment bar, and be condemned to pay the debts you owe to\r\nmen and to yourselves.\r\n\r\n48  For whatsoever you have done amiss must be performed again, and yet\r\nagain, until you reach the stature of the perfect man.\r\n\r\n49  But in due time the lowest and the highest will arise to walk in\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n50  Shall I accuse you unto God? No, for your prophet, Moses, has done\r\nthat; and if you hear not Moses’ words you will not hearken unto me,\r\nfor Moses wrote of me.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 92.\r\n\r\n    _The Christines at a feast in Lazarus’ home. A fire rages in\r\n      the town. Jesus rescues a child from the flames and stays\r\n      the fire by the Word. He gives a practical lesson on how to\r\n      redeem a drunken man._\r\n\r\nNow, Lazarus was at the feast and Jesus and the twelve went with him\r\nto his home in Bethany.\r\n\r\n2  And Lazarus and his sisters made a feast for Jesus and the twelve;\r\nand Ruth and Asher came from Jericho; for Asher was no longer hostile\r\nto the Christ.\r\n\r\n3  And while the guests sat at the board behold a cry, The village is\r\na-fire! and all rushed out into the streets, and, lo, the homes of\r\nmany neighbors were in flames.\r\n\r\n4  And in an upper room an infant lay asleep, and none could pass the\r\nflames to save. The mother, wild with grief, was calling on the men to\r\nsave her child.\r\n\r\n5  Then, with a voice that made the spirits of the fire pale and\r\ntremble, Jesus said, Peace, peace, be still!\r\n\r\n6  And then he walked through smoke and flame, climbed up the falling\r\nstair, and in a moment came again, and in his arms he brought the\r\nchild. And not a trace of fire was on himself, his raiment, or the\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n7  Then Jesus raised his hand, rebuked the spirits of the fire,\r\ncommanding them to cease their awful work, and be at rest.\r\n\r\n8  And then, as though the waters of the sea were all at once poured on\r\nthe flames, the fire ceased to burn.\r\n\r\n9  And when the fury of the fire was spent the multitudes were wild to\r\nsee the man who could control the fire, and Jesus said,\r\n\r\n10  Man was not made for fire, but fire was made for man.\r\n\r\n11  When man comes to himself and comprehends the fact that he is son\r\nof God, and knows that in himself lies all the powers of God, he is a\r\nmaster mind and all the elements will hear his voice and gladly do his\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n12  Two sturdy asses bind the will of man; their names are Fear and\r\nUnbelief. When these are caught and turned aside, the will of man will\r\nknow no bounds; then man has but to speak and it is done.\r\n\r\n13  And then the guests returned and sat about the board. A little\r\nchild came in and stood by Jesus’ side.\r\n\r\n14  She laid her hand on Jesus’ arm and said, Please, Master Jesus,\r\nhear! my father is a drunken man; my mother toils from morn till night\r\nand when she brings her wages home my father snatches them away and\r\nsquanders every cent for drink, and mother and us little ones are\r\nhungry all the night.\r\n\r\n15  Please, Master Jesus, come with me and touch my father’s heart. He\r\nis so good and kind when he is just himself; I know it is the wine\r\nthat makes another man of him.\r\n\r\n16  And Jesus went out with the child; he found the wretched home; he\r\nspoke in kindness to the mother and the little ones, and then upon a\r\nbed of straw he found the drunken man.\r\n\r\n17  He took him by the hand and raised him up and said, My brother,\r\nman, made in the image of our Father-God, will you arise and come with\r\nme?\r\n\r\n18  Your neighbors are in sore distress; they have lost all they had in\r\nthis fierce fire, and men must build their homes again and you and I\r\nmust lead the way.\r\n\r\n19  And then the man arose; the two went arm in arm to view the wrecks.\r\n\r\n20  They heard the mothers and the children crying in the streets; they\r\nsaw their wretchedness.\r\n\r\n21  And Jesus said, My friend, here is a work for you to do. Just lead\r\nthe way in helpfulness; I’m sure the men of Bethany will furnish you\r\nthe means and help.\r\n\r\n22  The spark of hope that had so long been smouldering in the man was\r\nfanned into a flame. He threw his ragged coat aside; he was himself\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n23  And then he called for help; not for himself, but for the homeless\r\nones; and everybody helped. The ruined homes were built again.\r\n\r\n24  And then he saw his own poor den; his heart was stirred into its\r\ndepths.\r\n\r\n25  The pride of manhood filled his soul; he said, This wretched\r\nden shall be a home. He worked as he had never wrought before, and\r\neverybody helped.\r\n\r\n26  And in a little while the den became a home indeed; the flowers of\r\nlove bloomed everywhere.\r\n\r\n27  The mother and the little ones were filled with joy; the father\r\nnever drank again.\r\n\r\n28  A man was saved, and no one ever said a word about neglect or\r\ndrunkenness, nor urged him to reform.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 93.\r\n\r\n    _The Christines go through a field of ripe wheat, and the\r\n      disciples eat of the wheat. Jesus exonerates them. The\r\n      Christines return to Capernaum. Jesus heals a withered hand\r\n      on the Sabbath, and defends his deed._\r\n\r\nAnother Sabbath day had come and Jesus and the twelve walked through a\r\nfield of ripened wheat.\r\n\r\n2  And they were hungry and they took the heads of wheat and in their\r\nhands threshed out the grain and ate.\r\n\r\n3  Among the men who followed them were Pharisees of strictest sect,\r\nand when they saw the twelve thresh out the wheat and eat, they said\r\nto Jesus,\r\n\r\n4  Sir, why do the twelve do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath\r\nday?\r\n\r\n5  And Jesus said, Have you not heard what David did when he and those\r\nwho followed him had need of food?\r\n\r\n6  How he went to the house of God and from the table in the Holy Place\r\ntook of the presence bread and ate, and gave to those who followed him?\r\n\r\n7  I tell you, men, the needs of man are higher than the law of rites.\r\n\r\n8  And in our sacred books we read how priests profane the Sabbath day\r\nin many ways while they are serving in the Holy Place, and still are\r\nfree from guilt.\r\n\r\n9  The Sabbath day was made for man; man was not made to fit the\r\nSabbath day.\r\n\r\n10  The man is son of God and under the eternal law of right, which is\r\nthe highest law, he may annul the statute laws.\r\n\r\n11  The law of sacrifice is but the law of man, and in our law we read\r\nthat God desires mercy first; and mercy stands above all statute laws.\r\n\r\n12  The son of man is Lord of every law. Did not a prophet sum the\r\nduties of the man when in the book he wrote: In mercy follow justice\r\nand walk humbly with your God?\r\n\r\n13  Then Jesus and the twelve returned to Galilee, and on the day\r\nbefore the Sabbath day they reached the home of Jesus in Capernaum.\r\n\r\n14  And on the Sabbath day they went up to the synagogue. The\r\nmultitudes were there and Jesus taught.\r\n\r\n15  Among the worshippers was one, a man who had a withered hand. The\r\nscribes and Pharisees observed that Jesus saw the man, and then they\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n16  What will he do? Will he attempt to heal upon the Sabbath day?\r\n\r\n17  And Jesus knew their thoughts and he called to the man who had the\r\nwithered hand and said, Arise, stand forth before these men.\r\n\r\n18  And Jesus said, You scribes and Pharisees, speak out and answer me:\r\nIs it a crime to save a life upon the Sabbath day?\r\n\r\n19  If you had sheep and one of them fell in a pit upon the Sabbath day\r\nwould you do wrong to take it out?\r\n\r\n20  Or would it please your God to let it suffer in the mire until\r\nanother day?\r\n\r\n21  But his accusers held their peace.\r\n\r\n22  And then he said to them, Are sheep of greater value than a man?\r\n\r\n23  The law of God is written on the rock of Right; and Justice wrote\r\nthe law, and Mercy was the pen.\r\n\r\n24  And then he said, Man, raise your hand and stretch it forth. He\r\nraised his hand; it was restored.\r\n\r\n25  The Pharisees were filled with rage. They called in secret council\r\nthe Herodians, and they began to plot and plan how they might bring\r\nabout his death.\r\n\r\n26  They were afraid to publicly accuse, because the multitudes stood\r\nforth in his defense.\r\n\r\n27  And Jesus and the twelve went down and walked beside the sea, and\r\nmany people followed them.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 94.\r\n\r\n    _The Sermon on the Mount. Jesus reveals to the twelve the\r\n      secret of prayer. The model prayer. The law of forgiveness.\r\n      The holy fast. The evil of deceit. Almsgiving._\r\n\r\nNext morning e’er the sun had risen Jesus and the twelve went to a\r\nmountain near the sea to pray; and Jesus taught the twelve disciples\r\nhow to pray. He said,\r\n\r\n2  Prayer is the deep communion of the soul with God;\r\n\r\n3  So when you pray do not deceive yourselves as do the hypocrites who\r\nlove to stand upon the streets and in the synagogues and pour out many\r\nwords to please the ears of men.\r\n\r\n4  And they adorn themselves with pious airs that they may have the\r\npraise of men. They seek the praise of men and their reward is sure.\r\n\r\n5  But when you pray, go to the closet of your soul; close all the\r\ndoors, and in the holy silence, pray.\r\n\r\n6  You need not speak a multitude of words, nor yet repeat the words\r\nagain and then again, as heathen do. Just say,\r\n\r\n7  Our Father-God who art in heaven; holy is thy name. Thy kingdom\r\ncome; thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven.\r\n\r\n8  Give us this day our needed bread;\r\n\r\n9  Help us forget the debts that other people owe to us, that all our\r\ndebts may be discharged.\r\n\r\n10  And shield us from the tempter’s snares that are too great for us\r\nto bear;\r\n\r\n11  And when they come give us the strength to overcome.\r\n\r\n12  If you would be discharged from all the debts you owe to God and\r\nman, the debts you have incurred by wilfully transgressing law,\r\n\r\n13  You must pass by the debts of every man; for as you deal with other\r\nmen your God will deal with you.\r\n\r\n14  And when you fast you may not advertise the deed.\r\n\r\n15  When fast the hypocrites they paint their faces, look demure,\r\nassume a pious pose, that they may seem to men to fast.\r\n\r\n16  A fast is deed of soul, and like a prayer, it is a function of the\r\nsilence of the soul.\r\n\r\n17  God never passes by unnoticed any prayer, or fast. He walks within\r\nthe silence, and his benedictions rest on every effort of the soul.\r\n\r\n18  Deception is hypocrisy, and you shall not assume to be what you are\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n19  You may not clothe yourselves in special garb to advertise your\r\npiety, nor yet assume the tone of voice that men conceive to be a holy\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n20  And when you give to aid the needy ones, blow not a trumpet in the\r\nstreet, nor synagogue to advertise your gift.\r\n\r\n21  He who does alms for praise of men has his reward from men; but God\r\nregardeth not.\r\n\r\n22  In giving alms do not let the right hand know the secret of the\r\nleft.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 95.\r\n\r\n    _The Sermon on the Mount, continued. Jesus pronounces the eight\r\n      beatitudes and the eight woes. Speaks words of encouragement.\r\n      Emphasizes the exalted character of the apostolic work._\r\n\r\nAnd Jesus and the twelve went to the mountain top, and Jesus said,\r\n\r\n2  Twelve pillars of the church, apostles of the Christ; light-bearers\r\nof the sun of life and ministers of God to men:\r\n\r\n3  In just a little while you must go forth alone, and preach the\r\ngospel of the king, first to the Jews and then to all the world.\r\n\r\n4  And you shall go, not with a scourge of cords to drive; you cannot\r\ndrive men to the king;\r\n\r\n5  But you shall go in love and helpfulness and lead the way to right\r\nand light.\r\n\r\n6  Go forth and say, The kingdom is at hand.\r\n\r\n7  Worthy are the strong in spirit; theirs the kingdom is.\r\n\r\n8  Worthy are the meek; they shall possess the land.\r\n\r\n9  Worthy they who hunger and who thirst for right; they shall be\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\n10  Worthy are the merciful; and mercy shall be shown to them.\r\n\r\n11  Worthy they who gain the mastery of self; they have the key of\r\npower.\r\n\r\n12  Worthy are the pure in heart; and they shall see the king.\r\n\r\n13  Worthy they who are maligned and wronged because they do the right;\r\ntheir persecutors they shall bless.\r\n\r\n14  Worthy is the trustful child of faith; he shall sit in the throne\r\nof power.\r\n\r\n15  Be not discouraged when the world shall persecute and call you\r\ncurst; but rather be exceeding glad.\r\n\r\n16  The prophets and the seers, and all the good of earth, have been\r\nmaligned.\r\n\r\n17  If you are worthy of the crown of life you will be slandered,\r\nvilified and curst on earth.\r\n\r\n18  Rejoice when evil men shall drive you from their ways and cause\r\nyour name to be a hiss and byword in the street.\r\n\r\n19  I say, rejoice; but deal in mercy with the doers of the wrong; they\r\nare but children at their play; they know not what they do.\r\n\r\n20  Rejoice not over fallen foes. As you help men rise from the depth\r\nof sin, so God will help you on to greater heights.\r\n\r\n21  Woe to the rich is gold and lands; they have temptations multiform.\r\n\r\n22  Woe unto men who walk at will in pleasure’s paths; their ways are\r\nfull of snares and dangerous pits.\r\n\r\n23  Woe to the proud; they stand upon a precipice; destruction waits\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\n24  Woe to the man of greed; for what he has is not his own; and, lo,\r\nanother comes; his wealth is gone.\r\n\r\n25  Woe to the hypocrite; his form is fair to look upon; his heart is\r\nfilled with carcasses and dead men’s bones.\r\n\r\n26  Woe to the cruel and relentless man; he is himself the victim of\r\nhis deeds.\r\n\r\n27  The evil he would do to other men rebounds; the scourger is the\r\nscourged.\r\n\r\n28  Woe to the libertine who preys upon the virtues of the weak. The\r\nhour comes when he will be the weak, the victim of a libertine of\r\ngreater power.\r\n\r\n29  Woe unto you when all the world shall speak in praise of you. The\r\nworld speaks not in praise of men who live within the Holy Breath; it\r\nspeaks in praise of prophets false, and of illusions base.\r\n\r\n30  You men who walk in Holy Breath are salt, the salt of earth; but if\r\nyou lose your virtue you are salt in name alone, worth nothing more\r\nthan dust.\r\n\r\n31  And you are light; are called to light the world.\r\n\r\n32  A city on a hill cannot be hid; its lights are seen afar; and while\r\nyou stand upon the hills of life men see your light and imitate your\r\nworks and honor God.\r\n\r\n33  Men do not light a lamp and hide it in a cask; they put it on a\r\nstand that it may light the house.\r\n\r\n34  You are the lamps of God; must not stand in the shade of earth\r\nillusions, but in the open, high upon the stand.\r\n\r\n35  I am not come to nullify the law, nor to destroy; but to fulfill.\r\n\r\n36  The Law, the Prophets and the Psalms were written in the wisdom of\r\nthe Holy Breath and cannot fail.\r\n\r\n37  The heavens and earth that are will change and pass away; the\r\nword of God is sure; it cannot pass until it shall accomplish that\r\nwhereunto it hath been sent.\r\n\r\n38  Whoever disregards the law of God and teaches men to do the same,\r\nbecomes a debtor unto God and cannot see his face until he has\r\nreturned and paid his debt by sacrifice of life.\r\n\r\n39  But he who hearkens unto God and keeps his law and does his will on\r\nearth, shall rule with Christ.\r\n\r\n40  The scribes and Pharisees regard the letter of the law; they cannot\r\ncomprehend the spirit of the law;\r\n\r\n41  And if your righteousness does not exceed the righteousness of\r\nscribe and Pharisee you cannot come into the kingdom of the soul.\r\n\r\n42  It is not what man does that gives him right to enter through the\r\ngates; his pass word is his character and his desire is his character.\r\n\r\n43  The letter of the law deals with the acts of man; the spirit of the\r\nlaw takes note of his desires.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 96.\r\n\r\n    _The Sermon on the Mount, continued. Jesus considers the Ten\r\n      Commandments. The philosophy of Christ the spirit of the\r\n      Commandments. Jesus unfolds the spiritual aspects of the\r\n      first four Commandments._\r\n\r\nGod gave the Ten Commandments unto men; upon the mountain Moses saw\r\nthe words of God; he wrote them down on solid rock; they cannot be\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\n2  These Ten Commandments show the justice side of God; but now the\r\nlove of God made manifest brings mercy on the wings of Holy Breath.\r\n\r\n3  Upon the unity of God the law was built. In all the world there is\r\none force; Jehovah is Almighty God.\r\n\r\n4  Jehovah wrote upon the heavens and Moses read,\r\n\r\n5  I am Almighty God and you shall have no God but me.\r\n\r\n6  There is one force, but many phases of that force; these phases men\r\ncall powers.\r\n\r\n7  All powers are of God; and they are manifests of God; they are the\r\nSpirits of the God.\r\n\r\n8  If men could seem to find another force and worship at its shrine,\r\nthey would but court illusion, vain,\r\n\r\n9  A shadow of the One, Jehovah, God, and they who worship shadows are\r\nbut shadows on the wall; for men are what they court.\r\n\r\n10  And God would have all men to be the substance, and in mercy he\r\ncommanded, You shall seek no God but me.\r\n\r\n11  And finite man can never comprehend infinite things. Man cannot\r\nmake an image of the Infinite in force.\r\n\r\n12  And when men make a God of stone or wood or clay they make an image\r\nof a shade; and they who worship at the shrine of shades are shades.\r\n\r\n13  So God in mercy said, You shall not carve out images of wood, or\r\nclay, or stone.\r\n\r\n14  Such idols are ideals, abased ideals, and men can gain no higher\r\nplane than their ideals.\r\n\r\n15  The God is Spirit, and in spirit men must worship if they would\r\nattain a consciousness of God.\r\n\r\n16  But man can never make a picture or an image of the Holy Breath.\r\n\r\n17  The name of God man may not speak with carnal lips; with Holy\r\nBreath alone can man pronounce the name.\r\n\r\n18  In vanity men think they know the name of God; they speak it\r\nlightly and irreverently, and thus they are accursed.\r\n\r\n19  If men did know the sacred name and spoke it with unholy lips, they\r\nwould not live to speak it once again.\r\n\r\n20  But God in mercy has not yet unveiled his name to those who cannot\r\nspeak with Holy Breath.\r\n\r\n21  But they who speak the substitute in idle way are guilty in the\r\nsight of God, who said,\r\n\r\n22  You shall not take the name of God in vain.\r\n\r\n23  The number of the Holy Breath is seven, and God holds in his hands\r\nthe sevens of time.\r\n\r\n24  In forming worlds he rested on the seventh day, and every seventh\r\nday is set apart as Sabbath day for men. God said,\r\n\r\n25  The seventh is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; remember it and\r\nkeep it wholly set apart for works of holiness; that is, for works not\r\nfor the selfish self, but for the universal self.\r\n\r\n26  Men may do work for self upon the six days of the week; but on the\r\nSabbath of the Lord they must do naught for self.\r\n\r\n27  This day is consecrated unto God; but man serves God by serving man.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 97.\r\n\r\n    _The Sermon on the Mount, continued. Jesus unfolds to the\r\n      twelve the spiritual aspects of the fifth and sixth\r\n      Commandments._\r\n\r\nGod is not force alone; for wisdom is his counterpart.\r\n\r\n2  When cherubim instructed man in wisdom’s ways they said that wisdom\r\nis the Mother of the race, as force is Father of the race.\r\n\r\n3  The man who honors the almighty and omniscient God is blessed, and\r\nin the tables of the law we read,\r\n\r\n4  Pay homage to your Father and your Mother of the race, that your\r\ndays may be prolonged upon the land that they have given you.\r\n\r\n5  The letter of the law commands; You shall not kill; and he who kills\r\nmust stand before the judgment seat,\r\n\r\n6  A person may desire to kill, yet if he does not kill he is not\r\njudged by law.\r\n\r\n7  The spirit of the law avers that he who shall desire to kill, or\r\nseeks revenge, is angry with a man without sufficient cause, must\r\nanswer to the judge;\r\n\r\n8  And he who calls his brother soulless vagabond shall answer to the\r\ncouncil of the just;\r\n\r\n9  And he who calls his brother a degenerate, a dog, fans into life the\r\nburning fires of hell within himself.\r\n\r\n10  Now, in the higher law we read that if your brother is aggrieved\r\nby something you have done, before you offer unto God your gifts, go\r\nforth and find your brother and be reconciled to him.\r\n\r\n11  It is not well to let the sun go down upon your wrath.\r\n\r\n12  If he will not be reconciled when you have laid aside all selfish\r\npleas, have waived all selfish rights, you will be guiltless in the\r\nsight of God; then go and offer unto God your gifts.\r\n\r\n13  If you owe aught to any man and cannot pay; or if a man shall claim\r\na greater sum than is his due, it is not well that you dispute his\r\nclaims.\r\n\r\n14  Resistance is the sire of anger; there is no mercy and no reason in\r\na wrathful man.\r\n\r\n15  I tell you it is better far to suffer loss than go to law, or call\r\nupon the courts of men to judge of right and wrong.\r\n\r\n16  The law of carnal man would say, Eye for eye and tooth for tooth;\r\nresist encroachment on your rights.\r\n\r\n17  But this is not the law of God. The Holy Breath would say, Resist\r\nnot him who would deprive you of your goods.\r\n\r\n18  He who would take your coat by force is still a brother man and you\r\nshould gain his heart, which by resistance cannot be done;\r\n\r\n19  Give him your coat and offer him still more and more; in time the\r\nman will rise above the brute; you will have saved him from himself.\r\n\r\n20  Refuse not him who calls for help and give to him who asks to\r\nborrow aught.\r\n\r\n21  And if a man shall strike you in a fitful, or an angry way, it is\r\nnot well to smite him in return.\r\n\r\n22  Men call him coward who will not fight and thus defend his rights;\r\nbut he is much the greater man who is assailed, is smitten and does\r\nnot smite;\r\n\r\n23  Who is maligned and answers not, than he who smites the smiter and\r\nreviles the one who slanders him.\r\n\r\n24  It has been said in olden times that man shall love his friend and\r\nhate his foe; but, lo, I say,\r\n\r\n25  Be merciful unto your foes; bless those who slander you; do good to\r\nthose who do you harm and pray for those who trample on your rights.\r\n\r\n26  Remember, you are children of the God who makes his sun to rise\r\nalike upon the evil and the good, who sends his rain upon the unjust\r\nand the just.\r\n\r\n27  If you do unto other men as they do unto you, you are but slaves,\r\nbut followers in the way to death.\r\n\r\n28  But you, as children of the light, must lead the way.\r\n\r\n29  Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\r\n\r\n30  When you do good to those who have done good to you, you do no more\r\nthan other men; the publicans do that.\r\n\r\n31  If you salute your friends and not your foes, you are like other\r\nmen; the publicans have set the pace.\r\n\r\n32  Be perfect as your Father-God in heaven is.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 98.\r\n\r\n    _The Sermon on the Mount, continued. Jesus reveals to the\r\n      twelve the spiritual aspects of the seventh, eighth and tenth\r\n      Commandments._\r\n\r\nThe law forbids adultery; but in the eyes of law adultery is an overt\r\nact, the satisfaction of the sensuous self outside the marriage bonds.\r\n\r\n2  Now, marriage in the sight of law is but a promise made by man and\r\nwoman, by the sanction of a priest, to live for aye in harmony and\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n3  No priest nor officer has power from God to bind two souls in wedded\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n4  What is the marriage tie? Is it comprised in what a priest or\r\nofficer may say?\r\n\r\n5  Is it the scroll on which the officer or priest has written the\r\npermission for the two to live in marriage bonds?\r\n\r\n6  Is it the promise of the two that they will love each other until\r\ndeath?\r\n\r\n7  Is love a passion that is subject to the will of man?\r\n\r\n8  Can man pick up his love, as he would pick up precious gems, and lay\r\nit down, or give it out to any one?\r\n\r\n9  Can love be bought and sold like sheep?\r\n\r\n10  Love is the power of God that binds two souls and makes them one;\r\nthere is no power on earth that can dissolve the bond.\r\n\r\n11  The bodies may be forced apart by man or death for just a little\r\ntime; but they will meet again.\r\n\r\n12  Now, in this bond of God we find the marriage tie; all other unions\r\nare but bonds of straw, and they who live in them commit adultery,\r\n\r\n13  The same as they who satisfy their lust without the sanction of an\r\nofficer or priest.\r\n\r\n14  But more than this; the man or woman who indulges lustful thoughts\r\ncommits adultery.\r\n\r\n15  Whom God has joined together man cannot part; whom man has joined\r\ntogether live in sin.\r\n\r\n16  Upon a table of the law, the great lawgiver wrote, Thou shalt not\r\nsteal.\r\n\r\n17  Before the eyes of law a man to steal must take a thing that can be\r\nseen with eyes of flesh, without the knowledge or consent of him to\r\nwhom the thing belongs.\r\n\r\n18  But, lo, I say that he who in his heart desires to possess that\r\nwhich is not his own, and would deprive the owner of the thing without\r\nhis knowledge or consent, is in the sight of God, a thief.\r\n\r\n19  The things that men see not with eyes of flesh are of more worth\r\nthan are the things that man can see.\r\n\r\n20  A man’s good name is worth a thousand mines of gold, and he who\r\nsays a word or does a deed that injures or defames that name has taken\r\nwhat is not his own, and is a thief.\r\n\r\n21  Upon a table of the law we also read; Thou shalt not covet anything.\r\n\r\n22  To covet is an all-consuming wish to have what is not right for one\r\nto have.\r\n\r\n23  And such a wish, within the spirit of the law, is theft.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 99.\r\n\r\n    _The Sermon on the Mount, continued. Jesus unfolds to the\r\n      twelve the spiritual aspects of the ninth Commandment._\r\n\r\nThe law has said: Thou shalt not lie; but in the eyes of law a man to\r\nlie must tell in words what is not true.\r\n\r\n2  Now, in the light of spirit law, deceit in any form is nothing but a\r\nlie.\r\n\r\n3  A man may lie by look or act; yea, even by his silence may deceive,\r\nand thus be guilty in the eyes of Holy Breath.\r\n\r\n4  It has been said in olden times: Thou shalt not swear by thine own\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n5  But, lo, I say, Swear not at all; not by the head, the heart, the\r\neye, nor hand; not by the sun, the moon, nor stars;\r\n\r\n6  Not by the name of God, nor by the name of any spirit, good or bad.\r\n\r\n7  You shall not swear by anything; for in an oath there is no gain.\r\n\r\n8  A man whose word must be propped up by oath of any kind is not\r\ntrustworthy in the sight of God or man.\r\n\r\n9  By oath you cannot make a leaf to fall, nor turn the color of a hair.\r\n\r\n10  The man of worth just speaks, and men know that he speaks the truth.\r\n\r\n11  The man who pours out many words to make men think he speaks the\r\ntruth, is simply making smoke to hide a lie.\r\n\r\n12  And there are many men with seeming double hearts; men who would\r\nserve two masters at a time--two masters quite adverse.\r\n\r\n13  Men feign to worship God upon the Sabbath day and then pay court to\r\nBeelzebul on every other day.\r\n\r\n14  No man can serve two masters at a time no more than he can ride two\r\nasses at a time that go in different ways.\r\n\r\n15  The man who feigns to worship God and Beelzebul is foe of God, a\r\npious devil and a curse of men.\r\n\r\n16  And men cannot lay treasures up in heaven and earth at once.\r\n\r\n17  Then, lo, I say, Lift up your eyes and see the safety vaults of\r\nheaven, and there deposit every gem,\r\n\r\n18  Where moth and rust cannot corrupt; where thieves cannot break in\r\nand steal.\r\n\r\n19  There are no safety vaults on earth; no place secure from moth, and\r\nrust and thieves.\r\n\r\n20  The treasures of the earth are but illusive things that pass away.\r\n\r\n21  Be not deceived; your treasures are the anchor of the soul, and\r\nwhere your treasures are your heart will be.\r\n\r\n22  Fix not your heart upon the things of earth; be anxious not about\r\nthe things to eat, or drink, or wear.\r\n\r\n23  God cares for those who trust in him and serve the race.\r\n\r\n24  Behold the birds! They praise God in their songs; the earth is made\r\nmore glorious by their ministry of joy; God keeps them in the hollow\r\nof his hand,\r\n\r\n25  And not a sparrow falls to earth without his care; and every one\r\nthat falls shall rise again.\r\n\r\n26  Behold the flowers of earth! they trust in God and grow; they make\r\nthe earth resplendent with their beauty and perfume.\r\n\r\n27  Look at the lilies of the field, the messengers of holy love. No\r\nson of man, not even Solomon in all his excellence, was ever clothed\r\nlike one of these.\r\n\r\n28  And yet they simply trust in God; they feed from out his hand; they\r\nlay their heads to rest upon his breast.\r\n\r\n29  If God so clothes and feeds the flowers and birds that do his will,\r\nwill he not feed and clothe his children when they trust in him?\r\n\r\n30  Seek first the kingdom of the soul, the righteousness of God, the\r\ngood of men, and murmur not; God will protect, and feed, and clothe.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 100.\r\n\r\n    _The Sermon on the Mount, continued. Jesus formulates and\r\n      presents to the twelve a practical code of spiritual ethics._\r\n\r\nThere is a rule that carnal man has made, and which he rigidly\r\nobserves:\r\n\r\n2  Do unto other men as they do unto you. As others judge, they judge;\r\nas others give, they give.\r\n\r\n3  Now, while you walk with men as men, judge not, and you shall not be\r\njudged.\r\n\r\n4  For as you judge you shall be judged, and as you give it shall be\r\ngiven to you. If you condemn, you are condemned.\r\n\r\n5  When you show mercy, men are merciful to you, and if you love in\r\nsuch a way that carnal man can comprehend your love, you will be well\r\nbeloved.\r\n\r\n6  And so the wise man of this world does unto other men as he would\r\nhave them do to him.\r\n\r\n7  The carnal man does good to other men for selfish gain, for he\r\nexpects to have his blessings multiplied and then returned; he does\r\nnot stop to note the end.\r\n\r\n8  Man is himself the field; his deeds are seeds, and what he does to\r\nothers grows apace; the harvest time is sure.\r\n\r\n9  Behold the yield! If he has sown the wind, he reaps the wind; if he\r\nhas sown the noxious seeds of scandal, theft and hate; of sensuality\r\nand crime,\r\n\r\n10  The harvest is assured and he must reap what he has sown; yea,\r\nmore; the seeds produce an hundred fold.\r\n\r\n11  The fruit of righteousness and peace and love and joy can never\r\nspring from noxious seeds; the fruit is like the seed.\r\n\r\n12  And when you sow, sow seeds of right, because it is the right, and\r\nnot in way of trade, expecting rich rewards.\r\n\r\n13  The carnal man abhors the spirit law, because it takes away his\r\nliberty to live in sin; beneath its light he cannot satisfy his\r\npassions and desires.\r\n\r\n14  He is at enmity with him who walks in Holy Breath. The carnal man\r\nhas killed the holy men of old, the prophets and the seers.\r\n\r\n15  And he will buffet you; will charge you falsely, scourge you and\r\nimprison you, and think he does the will of God to slay you in the\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\n16  But you may not prejudge nor censure him who does you wrong.\r\n\r\n17  Each one has problems to be solved, and he must solve them for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n18  The man who scourges you may have a load of sin to bear; but how\r\nabout your own?\r\n\r\n19  A little sin in one who walks in Holy Breath is greater in the\r\nsight of God than monster sins in him who never knew the way.\r\n\r\n20  How can you see the splinter in your brother’s eye while you have\r\nchunks within your own?\r\n\r\n21  First take the chunks from out your eye and then you may behold the\r\nsplinter in your brother’s eye and help him take it out,\r\n\r\n22  And while your eyes are full of foreign things you cannot see the\r\nway, for you are blind,\r\n\r\n23  And when the blind lead forth the blind, both lose the way and fall\r\ninto the slough.\r\n\r\n24  If you would lead the way to God you must be clear in sight, as\r\nwell as pure in heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 101.\r\n\r\n    _The Sermon on the Mount, concluded. The concluding part of the\r\n      code of ethics. The Christines return to Capernaum._\r\n\r\nThe fruitage of the tree of life is all too fine to feed the carnal\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n2  If you would throw a diamond to a hungry dog, lo, he would turn\r\naway, or else attack you in a rage.\r\n\r\n3  The incense that is sweet to God is quite offensive unto Beelzebul;\r\nthe bread of heaven is but chaff to men who cannot comprehend the\r\nspirit life.\r\n\r\n4  The master must be wise and feed the soul with what it can digest.\r\n\r\n5  If you have not the food for every man, just ask and you shall have;\r\nseek earnestly and you shall find.\r\n\r\n6  Just speak the Word and knock; the door will fly ajar.\r\n\r\n7  No one has ever asked in faith and did not have; none ever sought in\r\nvain; no one who ever knocked aright has failed to find an open door.\r\n\r\n8  When men shall ask you for the bread of heaven, turn not away, nor\r\ngive to them the fruit of carnal trees.\r\n\r\n9  If one, a son, would ask you for a loaf, would you give him a stone?\r\nIf he would ask you for a fish, would you give him a serpent of the\r\ndust?\r\n\r\n10  What you would have your God give unto you, give unto men. The\r\nmeasure of your worth lies in your service unto men.\r\n\r\n11  There is a way that leads unto the perfect life; few find it at a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n12  It is a narrow way; it lies among the rocks and pitfalls of the\r\ncarnal life; but in the way there are no pitfalls and no rocks.\r\n\r\n13  There is a way that leads to wretchedness and want. It is a\r\nspacious way and many walk therein. It lies among the pleasure groves\r\nof carnal life.\r\n\r\n14  Beware, for many claim to walk the way of life who walk the way of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n15  But they are false in word and deed; false prophets they. They\r\nclothe themselves in skins of sheep, while they are vicious wolves.\r\n\r\n16  They cannot long conceal themselves; men know them by their fruits;\r\n\r\n17  You cannot gather grapes from thorns, nor from the thistles, figs.\r\n\r\n18  The fruit is daughter of the tree and, like the parent, so the\r\nchild; and every tree that bears not wholesome fruit is plucked up by\r\nthe roots and cast away,\r\n\r\n19  Because a man prays long and loud is not a sign that he is saint.\r\nThe praying men are not all in the kingdom of the soul.\r\n\r\n20  The man who lives the holy life, who does the will of God, abides\r\nwithin the kingdom of the soul.\r\n\r\n21  The good man from the treasures of his heart sends blessedness and\r\npeace to all the world.\r\n\r\n22  The evil man sends thoughts that blight and wither hope and joy and\r\nfill the world with wretchedness and woe.\r\n\r\n23  Men think and act and speak out of the abundance of the heart.\r\n\r\n24  And when the judgment hour shall come a host of men will enter\r\npleadings for themselves and think to buy the favor of the judge with\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n25  And they will say, Lo, we have wrought a multitude of works in the\r\nOmnific name,\r\n\r\n26  Have we not prophesied? Have we not cured all manner of disease?\r\nHave we not cast the evil spirits out of those obsessed?\r\n\r\n27  And then the judge will say, I know you not. You rendered service\r\nunto God in words when in your heart you worshipped Beelzebul.\r\n\r\n28  The evil one may use the powers of life, and do a multitude of\r\nmighty works. Depart from me, you workers of iniquity.\r\n\r\n29  The man who hears the words of life and does them not is like the\r\nman who builds his house upon the sand, which when the floods come on,\r\nis washed away and all is lost.\r\n\r\n30  But he who hears the words of life and in an honest, sincere heart\r\nreceives and treasures them and lives the holy life,\r\n\r\n31  Is like the man who builds his house upon the rock; the floods may\r\ncome, the winds may blow, the storms may beat upon his house; it is\r\nnot moved.\r\n\r\n32  Go forth and build your life upon the solid rock of truth, and all\r\nthe powers of the evil one will shake it not.\r\n\r\n33  And Jesus finished all his sayings on the mount and then he, with\r\nthe twelve, returned unto Capernaum.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 102.\r\n\r\n    _The Christines at the home of Jesus. Jesus unfolds to them the\r\n      secret doctrine. They go through all Galilee and teach and\r\n      heal. Jesus brings to life the son of a widow at Nain. They\r\n      return to Capernaum._\r\n\r\nThe twelve apostles went with Jesus to his home, and there abode for\r\ncertain days.\r\n\r\n2  And Jesus told them many things about the inner life that may not\r\nnow be written in a book.\r\n\r\n3  Now, in Capernaum there lived a man of wealth, a Roman captain of a\r\nhundred men, who loved the Jews and who had built for them a synagogue.\r\n\r\n4  A servant of this man was paralyzed, and he was sick nigh unto death.\r\n\r\n5  The captain knew of Jesus and had heard that by the sacred Word he\r\nhealed the sick, and he had faith in him.\r\n\r\n6  He sent a message by the elders of the Jews to Jesus, and he plead\r\nfor help.\r\n\r\n7  And Jesus recognized the captain’s faith and went at once to heal\r\nthe sick; the captain met him on the way and said to him,\r\n\r\n8  Lo, Lord, it is not well that you should come into my house; I am\r\nnot worthy of the presence of a man of God.\r\n\r\n9  I am a man of war; my life is spent with those who ofttimes take the\r\nlives of fellow men,\r\n\r\n10  And surely he who comes to save would be dishonored if he came\r\nbeneath my roof.\r\n\r\n11  If you will speak the Word I know my servant will be well.\r\n\r\n12  And Jesus turned and said to those who followed him,\r\n\r\n13  Behold the captain’s faith; I have not seen such faith, no, not in\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\n14  Behold, the feast is spread for you; but while you doubt and wait,\r\nthe alien comes in faith and takes the bread of life.\r\n\r\n15  Then turning to the man he said, Go on your way; according to your\r\nfaith so shall it be; your servant lives.\r\n\r\n16  It came to pass that at the time that Jesus spoke the Word the\r\npalsied man arose, and he was well.\r\n\r\n17  And then the Christines went abroad to teach. And as they came to\r\nNain, a city on the Hermon way, they saw a multitude about the gates.\r\n\r\n18  It was a funeral train; a widow’s son was dead, and friends were\r\nbearing out the body to the tomb.\r\n\r\n19  It was the widow’s only son, and she was wild with grief. And Jesus\r\nsaid to her, Weep not, I am the life; your son shall live.\r\n\r\n20  And Jesus raised his hand; the bearers of the dead stood still.\r\n\r\n21  And Jesus touched the bier and said, Young man, return.\r\n\r\n22  The soul returned; the body of the dead was filled with life; the\r\nman sat up and spoke.\r\n\r\n23  The people were astonished at the scene, and every one exclaimed,\r\nPraise God.\r\n\r\n24  A Jewish priest stood forth and said, Behold, a mighty prophet has\r\nappeared; and all the people said, Amen.\r\n\r\n25  The Christines journeyed on; they taught, and healed the sick in\r\nmany towns of Galilee, and then they came again unto Capernaum.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 103.\r\n\r\n    _The Christines in Jesus’ home. Jesus teaches the twelve\r\n      and the foreign masters every morning. Jesus receives\r\n      messengers from John, the harbinger, and sends him words of\r\n      encouragement. He eulogizes the character of John._\r\n\r\nThe home of Jesus was a school where in the early morning hours the\r\ntwelve apostles and the foreign priests were taught the secret things\r\nof God.\r\n\r\n2  And there were present priests from China, India and from Babylon;\r\nfrom Persia, Egypt and from Greece,\r\n\r\n3  Who came to sit at Jesus’ feet to learn the wisdom that he brought\r\nto men, that they might teach their people how to live the holy life.\r\n\r\n4  And Jesus taught them how to teach; he told them of the trials of\r\nthe way, and how to make these trials serve the race.\r\n\r\n5  He taught them how to live the holy life that they might conquer\r\ndeath;\r\n\r\n6  He taught them what the end of mortal life will be, when man has\r\nreached the consciousness that he and God are one.\r\n\r\n7  The after midday hours were given to the multitudes who came to\r\nlearn the way of life and to be healed; and many did believe and were\r\nbaptized.\r\n\r\n8  Now, in his prison by the Bitter Sea the harbinger had heard of all\r\nthe mighty works that Jesus did.\r\n\r\n9  His prison life was hard, and he was sore distressed, and he began\r\nto doubt.\r\n\r\n10  And to himself he said, I wonder if this Jesus is the Christ of\r\nwhom the prophets wrote!\r\n\r\n11  Was I mistaken in my work? Was I, indeed, one sent from God to pave\r\nthe way for him who shall redeem our people, Israel?\r\n\r\n12  And then he sent some of his friends, who came to see him in his\r\nprison cell, up to Capernaum that they might learn about this man, and\r\nbring him word.\r\n\r\n13  The men found Jesus in his home, and said, Behold the harbinger\r\nsent us to ask, Are you the Christ? or is he yet to come?\r\n\r\n14  But Jesus answered not; he simply bade the men to tarry certain\r\ndays that they might see and hear.\r\n\r\n15  They saw him heal the sick, and cause the lame to walk, the deaf to\r\nhear, the blind to see;\r\n\r\n16  They saw him cast the evil spirits out of those obsessed; they saw\r\nhim raise the dead.\r\n\r\n17  They heard him preach the gospel to the poor.\r\n\r\n18  Then Jesus said to them, Go on your way; return to John and tell\r\nhim all that you have seen and heard; then he will know. They went\r\ntheir way.\r\n\r\n19  The multitudes were there, and Jesus said to them, Once you were\r\ncrowding Jordan’s fords; you filled the wilderness.\r\n\r\n20  What did you go to see? The trees of Juda, and the flowers of Heth?\r\nOr did you go to see a man in kingly garb? Or did you go to see a\r\nprophet and a seer?\r\n\r\n21  I tell you, men, you know not whom you saw. A prophet? Yea, and\r\nmore; a messenger whom God had sent to pave the way for what you see\r\nand hear this day.\r\n\r\n22  Among the men of earth a greater man has never lived than John.\r\n\r\n23  Behold I say, This man whom Herod bound in chains and cast into a\r\nprison cell, is God’s Elijah come again to earth.\r\n\r\n24  Elijah, who did not pass the gates of death, whose body of this\r\nflesh was changed, and he awoke in Paradise.\r\n\r\n25  When John came forth and preached the gospel of repentance for the\r\ncleansing of the soul, the common folks believed and were baptized.\r\n\r\n26  The lawyers and the Pharisees accepted not the teachings of this\r\nman; were not baptized.\r\n\r\n27  Behold, neglected opportunities will never come again.\r\n\r\n28  Behold, the people are unstable as the waters of the sea; they seek\r\nto be excused from righteousness.\r\n\r\n29  John came and ate no bread, and drank no wine. He lived the\r\nsimplest life apart from men, and people said, He is obsessed.\r\n\r\n30  Another comes who eats and drinks and lives in homes like other\r\nmen, and people say, He is a glutton, an inebriate, a friend of\r\npublicans and those who sin.\r\n\r\n31  Woe unto you, you cities of the vale of Galilee, where all the\r\nmighty works of God are done! Woe to Chorazan and Bethsaida!\r\n\r\n32  If half the mighty works that have been done in you were done in\r\nTyre and in Sidon they would have long ago repented of their sins, and\r\nsought the way of right.\r\n\r\n33  And when the judgment day shall come, lo, Tyre and Sidon will be\r\ncalled more worthy than will you,\r\n\r\n34  Because they slighted not their gifts, while you have thrown away\r\nthe pearl of greatest price.\r\n\r\n35  Woe unto you Capernaum! Behold, you are exalted now, but you shall\r\nbe abased;\r\n\r\n36  For if the mighty works that have been done in you had but been\r\ndone within the cities of the plain--of Sodom and Zeboim--they would\r\nhave heard and turned to God; would not have been destroyed.\r\n\r\n37  They perished in their ignorance; they had no light; but you have\r\nheard; you have the evidence.\r\n\r\n38  The light of life has shown above your hills and all the shores of\r\nGalilee have been ablaze with light;\r\n\r\n39  The glory of the Lord has shown in every street and synagogue and\r\nhome; but you have spurned the light.\r\n\r\n40  And, lo, I say, The judgment day will come and God will deal in\r\ngreater mercy with the cities of the plains than he will deal with you.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 104.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus teaches the multitudes. Attends a feast in Simon’s\r\n      house. A wealthy courtesan anoints him with precious\r\n      balm. Simon rebukes him and he preaches a sermon on false\r\n      respectability._\r\n\r\nAnd Jesus looked upon the multitudes who pressed about for selfish\r\ngain.\r\n\r\n2  The men of learning and of wealth, of reputation and of power, were\r\nthere; but they knew not the Christ.\r\n\r\n3  Their eyes were blinded by the tinseled glitter of their selfish\r\nselves; they could not see the king.\r\n\r\n4  And though they walked within the light, they groped about in\r\ndark--a darkness like the night of death.\r\n\r\n5  And Jesus cast his eyes to heaven and said,\r\n\r\n6  I thank thee, Holy One of heaven and earth, that while the light is\r\nhidden from the wise and great, it is revealed to babes.\r\n\r\n7  Then turning to the multitudes he said, I come to you not in the\r\nname of man, nor in a strength my own;\r\n\r\n8  The wisdom and the virtue that I bring to you are from above; they\r\nare the wisdom and the virtue of the God whom we adore.\r\n\r\n9  The words I speak are not my words; I give to you what I receive.\r\n\r\n10  Come unto me all you who labor and pull heavy loads and I will give\r\nyou aid.\r\n\r\n11  Put on the yoke of Christ with me; it does not chafe; it is an\r\neasy yoke.\r\n\r\n12  Together we will pull the load of life with ease; and so rejoice.\r\n\r\n13  A Pharisee, whose name was Simon, made a feast, and Jesus was the\r\nhonored guest.\r\n\r\n14  And as they sat about the board, a courtesan who had been cured\r\nof her desire to sin by what she had received and seen in Jesus’\r\nministry, came uninvited to the feast.\r\n\r\n15  She brought an alabaster box of costly balm and as the guests\r\nreclined she came to Jesus in her joy, because she had been freed from\r\nsin,\r\n\r\n16  Her tears fell fast, she kissed his feet, and dried them with her\r\nhair, and she anointed them with balm.\r\n\r\n17  And Simon thought, he did not speak aloud, This man is not a\r\nprophet or he would know the kind of woman that approaches him, and\r\nwould drive her away.\r\n\r\n18  But Jesus knew his thoughts, and said to him, My host, I have a\r\nword to say to you.\r\n\r\n19  And Simon said, Say on.\r\n\r\n20  And Jesus said, Sin is a monster of iniquity; it may be small;\r\nit may be large; it may be something done; it may be something left\r\nundone.\r\n\r\n21  Behold, one person leads a life of sin and is at last redeemed;\r\nanother, in a careless mood, forgets to do the things he ought to do;\r\nbut he reforms and is forgiven. Now, which of these has merited the\r\nhigher praise?\r\n\r\n22  And Simon said, The one who overcame the errors of a life.\r\n\r\n23  And Jesus said, You speak the truth.\r\n\r\n24  Behold, this woman who has bathed my feet with tears and dried them\r\nwith her hair and covered them with balm!\r\n\r\n25  For years she led a life of sin, but when she heard the words of\r\nlife she sought forgiveness and she found.\r\n\r\n26  But when I came into your house as guest you gave me not a bowl of\r\nwater that I might wash my hands and feet, which every loyal Jew must\r\ndo before he feasts.\r\n\r\n27  Now, tell me, Simon, which of these, this woman or yourself, is\r\nworthy of most praise?\r\n\r\n28  But Simon answered not.\r\n\r\n29  Then to the woman Jesus said, Your sins are all forgiven; your\r\nfaith has saved you; go in peace.\r\n\r\n30  And then the guests who sat around the board, began to say within\r\nthemselves, What manner of a man is this who says, Thy sins are all\r\nforgiven?\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 105.\r\n\r\n    _Under the patronage of a number of wealthy women, the\r\n      Christines make a grand missionary tour. In his teaching\r\n      Jesus lauds sincerity and rebukes hypocrisy. He speaks\r\n      concerning the sin against the Holy Breath._\r\n\r\nNow, many women who possessed much wealth, and who abode in other\r\ntowns of Galilee, implored that Jesus and the twelve, together with\r\nthe masters from the foreign lands, would thither go and preach and\r\nheal.\r\n\r\n2  Among these anxious ones were Mary Magdalene, who was obsessed by\r\nseven homeless spirits of the air, which had been driven out by the\r\nOmnific Word which Jesus spoke;\r\n\r\n3  Susanna, who owned vast estates at Cæsarea-Philippi;\r\n\r\n4  Johanna, wife of Chuza, one of Herod’s court;\r\n\r\n5  And Rachel from the coast of Tyre;\r\n\r\n6  And others from beyond the Jordan and the sea of Galilee.\r\n\r\n7  And they provided ample means and three times seven men went forth.\r\n\r\n8  They preached the gospel of the Christ, and they baptized the\r\nmultitudes who made confession of their faith; they healed the sick\r\nand raised the dead.\r\n\r\n9  And Jesus wrought and taught from early morn until the day had gone,\r\nand then into the night; he did not stop to eat.\r\n\r\n10  His friends became alarmed lest he should fail from loss of\r\nstrength, and they laid hold of him and would, by force, have taken\r\nhim away to place of rest.\r\n\r\n11  But he rebuked them not; he said, Have you not read that God will\r\ngive his angels charge concerning me?\r\n\r\n12  That they would hold me fast and suffer not that I should come to\r\nwant?\r\n\r\n13  I tell you, men, while I am giving out my strength unto these\r\nanxious, waiting throngs I find myself at rest within the arms of God,\r\n\r\n14  Whose blessed messengers bring down to me the bread of life.\r\n\r\n15  There is a tide just once in human life.\r\n\r\n16  These people now are willing to receive the truth; their\r\nopportunity is now: our opportunity is now.\r\n\r\n17  And if we do not teach them while we may, the tide will ebb;\r\n\r\n18  They may not care again to hear the truth; then tell me, Who will\r\nbear the guilt?\r\n\r\n19  And so he taught and healed.\r\n\r\n20  Among the multitudes were men of every shade of thought. They were\r\ndivided in their views concerning everything that Jesus said.\r\n\r\n21  Some saw in him a God, and would have worshipped him; and others\r\nsaw in him a devil of the nether world and would have cast him in a\r\npit.\r\n\r\n22  And some were trying hard to lead a double life; like little lions\r\nof the ground that take upon themselves the color of the thing they\r\nrest upon.\r\n\r\n23  These people without anchorage of any sort, are friends or foes as\r\nseemed to serve them best.\r\n\r\n24  And Jesus said, No man can serve two masters at a time. No man can\r\nbe a friend and foe at once.\r\n\r\n25  All men are rising up, or sinking down; are building up, or tearing\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n26  If you are gathering not the precious grain, then you are throwing\r\nit away.\r\n\r\n27  He is a coward who would feign to be a friend, or foe, to please\r\nanother man.\r\n\r\n28  You men, do not deceive yourselves in thought; your hearts are\r\nknown;\r\n\r\n29  Hypocrisy will blight a soul as surely as the breath of Beelzebul.\r\nAn honest evil man is more esteemed by guardians of the soul than a\r\ndishonest pious man.\r\n\r\n30  If you would curse the son of man, just curse him out aloud.\r\n\r\n31  A curse is poison to the inner man, and if you hold and swallow\r\ndown a curse it never will digest; lo, it will poison every atom of\r\nyour soul.\r\n\r\n32  And if you sin against a son of man, you may be pardoned and your\r\nguilt be cleansed by acts of kindness and of love;\r\n\r\n33  But if you sin against the Holy Breath by disregarding her when\r\nshe would open up the doors of life for you;\r\n\r\n34  By closing up the windows of the soul when she would pour the light\r\nof love into your hearts, and cleanse them with the fires of God;\r\n\r\n35  Your guilt shall not be blotted out in this, nor in the life to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n36  An opportunity has gone to come no more, and you must wait until\r\nthe ages roll again.\r\n\r\n37  Then will the Holy Breath again breathe on your fires of life, and\r\nfan them to a living flame.\r\n\r\n38  Then she will open up the doors again, and you may let her in to\r\nsup with you forevermore, or you may slight her once again, and then\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n39  You men of Israel, your opportunity is now.\r\n\r\n40  Your tree of life is an illusive tree; it has a generous crop of\r\nleaves; its boughs hang low with fruit.\r\n\r\n41  Behold, your words are leaves; your deeds the fruit.\r\n\r\n42  Behold, for men have plucked the apples of your tree of life, and\r\nfound them full of bitterness; and worms have eaten to the core.\r\n\r\n43  Behold that fig tree by the way so full of leaves and worthless\r\nfruit!\r\n\r\n44  Then Jesus spoke a word that nature spirits know, and lo, the fig\r\ntree stood a mass of withered leaves.\r\n\r\n45  And then he spoke again, Behold, for God will speak the Word, and\r\nyou will stand a withered fig tree in the setting sun.\r\n\r\n46  You men of Galilee, send forth and call the pruner in before it is\r\ntoo late, and let him prune away your worthless branches and illusive\r\nleaves, and let the sunshine in.\r\n\r\n47  The sun is life, and it can change your worthlessness to worth.\r\n\r\n48  Your tree of life is good; but you have nurtured it so long with\r\ndews of self, and mists of carnal things that you have shut the\r\nsunshine out.\r\n\r\n49  I tell you, men, that you must give account to God for every idle\r\nword you speak and every evil deed you do.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 106.\r\n\r\n    _The Christines are in Magdala. Jesus heals a man who was\r\n      blind, dumb and obsessed. He teaches the people. While he\r\n      speaks his mother, brothers and Miriam come to him. He\r\n      teaches a lesson on family relationship. He introduces Miriam\r\n      to the people and she sings her songs of victory._\r\n\r\nMagdala is beside the sea, and here the teachers taught.\r\n\r\n2  A man obsessed, and who was blind and dumb was brought, and Jesus\r\nspoke the Word, and lo, the evil spirits went away; the man spoke out,\r\nhis eyes were opened and he saw.\r\n\r\n3  This was the greatest work that men had seen the master do, and they\r\nwere all amazed.\r\n\r\n4  The Pharisees were there, and they were full of jealous rage; they\r\nsought a cause whereby they might condemn.\r\n\r\n5  They said, Yes, it is true that Jesus does a multitude of mighty\r\nworks; but men should know that he is leagued with Beelzebul.\r\n\r\n6  He is a sorcerer, a black magician of the Simon Cerus type; he works\r\nas Jannes and as Jambres did in Moses’ day.\r\n\r\n7  For Satan, prince of evil spirits, is his stay by night and day,\r\nand in the name of Satan he casts the demons out, and in his name he\r\nheals the sick and raises up the dead.\r\n\r\n8  But Jesus knew their thoughts; he said to them, You men are masters,\r\nand you know the law; whatever is arrayed against itself must fall; a\r\nhouse divided cannot stand;\r\n\r\n9  A kingdom warring with itself is brought to naught.\r\n\r\n10  If Satan casts the devil out, how can his kingdom stand?\r\n\r\n11  If I, by Beelzebul, cast devils out, by whom do you cast devils out?\r\n\r\n12  But if I, in the holy name of God, cast devils out, and make the\r\nlame to walk, the deaf to hear, the blind to see, the dumb to speak,\r\nhas not God’s kingdom come to you?\r\n\r\n13  The Pharisees were dumb; they answered not.\r\n\r\n14  As Jesus spoke a messenger approached and said to him, Your mother\r\nand your brothers wish to speak with you.\r\n\r\n15  And Jesus said, Who is my mother? and my brothers, who are they?\r\n\r\n16  And then he spoke a word aside unto the foreign masters and the\r\ntwelve; he said,\r\n\r\n17  Behold, men recognize their mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers\r\nhere in flesh; but when the veil is rent and men walk in the realms of\r\nsoul,\r\n\r\n18  The tender lines of love that bind the groups of fleshy kin in\r\nfamilies will fade away.\r\n\r\n19  Not that the love for anyone will be the less; but men will see in\r\nall the motherhood, the fatherhood, the sisterhood, the brotherhood of\r\nman.\r\n\r\n20  The family groups of earth will all be lost in universal love and\r\nfellowship divine.\r\n\r\n21  Then to the multitudes he said, Whoever lives the life and does the\r\nwill of God is child of God and is my mother, father, sister, friend.\r\n\r\n22  And then he went aside to speak to mother and his other kindred in\r\nthe flesh.\r\n\r\n23  But he saw more than these. The maiden who once thrilled his very\r\nsoul with love, a love beyond the love of any fleshly kin;\r\n\r\n24  Who was the sorest tempter in the temple Heliopolis beside the\r\nNile, who sung for him the sacred songs, was there.\r\n\r\n25  The recognition was of kindred souls, and Jesus said,\r\n\r\n26  Behold, for God has brought to us a power men cannot comprehend, a\r\npower of purity and love;\r\n\r\n27  To make more light the burdens of the hour, to be a balm for\r\nwounded souls;\r\n\r\n28  To win the multitude to better ways by sacred song and holy life.\r\n\r\n29  Behold, for Miriam who stood beside the sea and sung the song of\r\nvictory when Moses led the way, will sing again.\r\n\r\n30  And all the choirs of heaven will join and sing the glad refrain:\r\n\r\n31  Peace, peace on earth; good will to men!\r\n\r\n32  And Miriam stood before the waiting throngs and sung again the\r\nsongs of victory, and all the people said, Amen.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 107.\r\n\r\n    _A Pharisee demands of Jesus signs of his messiahship. Jesus\r\n      rebukes him, because he does not recognize the signs that are\r\n      being continually given. Jesus exhorts the people to receive\r\n      the light that they may become the light._\r\n\r\nA Pharisee elated with himself stood forth among the multitudes and\r\nsaid to Jesus,\r\n\r\n2  Sir, we would have you demonstrate. If you are truly Christ who was\r\nto come, then you can surely do what black magicians cannot do.\r\n\r\n3  Lo, they can talk, and hold the multitudes with words of power; and\r\nthey can heal the sick and drive the demons out of those obsessed;\r\n\r\n4  They can control the storms; and fire and earth and air will hear\r\nand answer when they speak.\r\n\r\n5  Now, if you will ascend and from that tower fly across the sea, we\r\nwill believe that you are sent from God.\r\n\r\n6  And Jesus said, No black magician ever lived a holy life; you have a\r\ndemonstration of the Christ-life every day.\r\n\r\n7  But lo, you evil and adulterous scribes and Pharisees, you cannot\r\nsee a spirit-sign, because your spirit eyes are full of carnal self.\r\n\r\n8  You seek a sign to please your curiosity. You walk the very lowest\r\nplanes of carnal life and cry, Phenomena! show us a sign and then we\r\nwill believe.\r\n\r\n9  I was not sent to earth to buy up faith as men buy fish and fruit\r\nand rubbish in the streets.\r\n\r\n10  Men seem to think it quite a favor done to me when they confess\r\ntheir faith in me and in the holy Christ.\r\n\r\n11  What does it matter unto me as man if you believe or disbelieve?\r\n\r\n12  Faith is not something you can buy with coin; it is not something\r\nyou can sell for gold.\r\n\r\n13  Once Mart, a beggar, followed me and cried, Give me a silver piece;\r\nthen I will believe in you.\r\n\r\n14  And you are like this beggar man; you offer to exchange your faith\r\nfor signs.\r\n\r\n15  But I will give to all the world one sign as surety that the Christ\r\nabides with me.\r\n\r\n16  You all have read the parable of Jonah and the fish, wherein it\r\nis recorded that the prophet spent three days and nights within the\r\nstomach of the mighty fish, and then came forth.\r\n\r\n17  The son of man will spend three days and nights within the heart of\r\nearth and then come forth again, and men will see and know.\r\n\r\n18  Behold, the light may be so bright that men cannot see anything.\r\n\r\n19  The Spirit light has shown so brightly over Galilee that you who\r\nhear me now are blind.\r\n\r\n20  You may have read the words of prophet Azrael; he said, The light\r\nshall shine out brightly in the darkness of the night, and men shall\r\ncomprehend it not.\r\n\r\n21  That time has come; the light shines forth; you see it not.\r\n\r\n22  The Queen of Sheba sat in darkest night and still she yearned for\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n23  She came to hear the words of wisdom from the lips of Solomon, and\r\nshe believed;\r\n\r\n24  And she became a living torch, and when she reached her home, lo,\r\nall Arabia was filled with light.\r\n\r\n25  A greater far than Solomon is here; the Christ is here; the Day\r\nStar has arisen, and you reject the light.\r\n\r\n26  And you remember Nineveh, the wicked city of Assyria, which God had\r\nmarked to be destroyed by shock and flame unless the people turned and\r\nwalked in ways of right.\r\n\r\n27  And Jonah raised his voice and said, In forty days shall Nineveh be\r\nrazed, and all her wealth shall be destroyed.\r\n\r\n28  The people heard and they believed; and they reformed and turned to\r\nways of right, and lo, their city was not razed; was not destroyed.\r\n\r\n29  You men of Galilee, I tell you that Arabia and Nineveh will testify\r\nagainst you in the judgment day.\r\n\r\n30  Behold, for every one to whom I speak has in him all the fires of\r\nGod; but they are lying dead.\r\n\r\n31  The will is bridled by the flesh desires, and it brings not the\r\nethers of the fires to vibrate into light.\r\n\r\n32  Look, therefore, to your soul and note, Is not the light within you\r\ndark as night?\r\n\r\n33  There is no breath but Holy Breath that e’er can fan your fires of\r\nlife into a living flame and make them light.\r\n\r\n34  And Holy Breath can raise the ethers of the fires to light in none\r\nbut hearts of purity and love.\r\n\r\n35  Hear, then, you men of Galilee, Make pure the heart, admit the Holy\r\nBreath, and then your bodies will be full of light,\r\n\r\n36  And like a city on a hill, your light will shine afar, and thus\r\nyour light may light the way for other men.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 108.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus rebukes the people for selfishness. The Christines\r\n      attend a feast and Jesus is censured by the Pharisee because\r\n      he washed not before he eat. Jesus exposes the hypocrisy of\r\n      the ruling classes and pronounces upon them many woes._\r\n\r\nThe multitudes were wild with selfish thought; none recognized the\r\nrights and needs of any other one.\r\n\r\n2  The stronger pushed the weak aside, and trampled on them in their\r\nhaste to be the first to get a blessing for himself.\r\n\r\n3  And Jesus said, Behold the cage of beasts untamed; a den of stinging\r\nvipers, maddened by their fiendish greed of selfish gain!\r\n\r\n4  I tell you, men, the benefits that come to men who see no further\r\nthan themselves are baubles in the morning light;\r\n\r\n5  They are unreal; they pass away. The selfish soul is fed today; the\r\nfood does not assimilate; the soul grows not, and then it must be fed\r\nagain, and then again.\r\n\r\n6  Behold, a selfish man obsessed by just one spirit of the air; by the\r\nOmnific Word the spirit is cast out;\r\n\r\n7  It wanders through dry places, seeking rest and finding none.\r\n\r\n8  And then it comes again; the selfish man has failed to close and\r\nlock the door;\r\n\r\n9  The unclean spirit finds the house all swept and cleaned; it enters\r\nin and takes with it full seven other spirits more unclean than is\r\nitself; and there they dwell.\r\n\r\n10  The last state of the man is more than sevenfold more wretched than\r\nthe first.\r\n\r\n11  And so it is with you who snatch the blessings that belong to other\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n12  While Jesus spoke a certain woman who stood near exclaimed, Most\r\nblessed is the mother of this man of God!\r\n\r\n13  And Jesus said, Yes, blest is she; but doubly blest are they who\r\nhear, receive and live the word of God.\r\n\r\n14  A Pharisee of wealth prepared a feast, and Jesus and the twelve,\r\ntogether with the masters from afar, were guests.\r\n\r\n15  And Jesus did not wash his hands according to the strictest\r\nPharisaic rules, before he ate; when this the Pharisee observed he\r\nmarveled much.\r\n\r\n16  And Jesus said, My host, why do you marvel that I did not wash my\r\nhands?\r\n\r\n17  The Pharisees wash well their hands and feet; they cleanse the body\r\nevery day when, lo, within is every form of filth.\r\n\r\n18  Their hearts are full of wickedness, extortions and deceit.\r\n\r\n19  Did not the God who made the outside of the body make the inside,\r\ntoo?\r\n\r\n20  And then he said, Woe unto you, you Pharisees! for you tithe mint\r\nand rue, and every herb, and pass by judgment and the love of God.\r\n\r\n21  Woe unto you, you Pharisees! you love the highest seats in\r\nsynagogues and courts, and bid for salutations in the market place.\r\n\r\n22  Woe unto you, you tinseled gentry of the land! no man would ever\r\nthink you servants of the Lord of hosts by what you do.\r\n\r\n23  A lawyer sitting near remarked, Rabboni, your words are harsh, and\r\nthen in what you say you censure us; and why?\r\n\r\n24  And Jesus said, Woe unto you, you masters of the law! you heap\r\ngreat burdens on the sons of men, yea, loads by far too great for them\r\nto bear, and you will never help to bear a feather’s weight yourselves.\r\n\r\n25  Woe unto you! you build the tombs of prophets and of seers; they\r\nwhom your fathers killed; and you are parties to the crimes.\r\n\r\n26  And now behold, for God has sent again to you his holy\r\nmen-apostles, prophets, seers; and you are persecuting them.\r\n\r\n27  The time is near when you will plead against them in the courts;\r\nwill spurn them on the streets; will cast them into prison cells, and\r\nkill them with a fiend’s delight.\r\n\r\n28  I tell you, men, the blood of all the holy men of God that has been\r\nshed from righteous Abel down to that of Zacharias, father of the holy\r\nJohn,\r\n\r\n29  Who was struck down beside the altar in the Holy Place--\r\n\r\n30  The blood of all these holy men has made more red the hands of this\r\nungodly generation.\r\n\r\n31  Woe unto you, you masters of the law! you snatch the keys of\r\nknowledge from the hands of men;\r\n\r\n32  You close the doors; you enter not yourselves, and suffer not the\r\nwilling ones to enter in.\r\n\r\n33  His words provoked the Pharisees, the lawyers and the scribes, and\r\nthey, resenting, poured upon him torrents of abuse.\r\n\r\n34  The truths he spoke came like a thunderbolt from heaven; the rulers\r\ncounseled how they might ensnare him by his words; they sought a legal\r\nway to shed his blood.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 109.\r\n\r\n    _The Christines go to a place apart to pray. Jesus warns them\r\n      against the leaven of the Pharisees and reveals the fact\r\n      that all thoughts and deeds are recorded in God’s Book of\r\n      Remembrance. Man’s responsibility and God’s care._\r\n\r\nNow, when the feast was finished Jesus with the foreign masters and\r\nthe twelve, with Mary, Miriam and a band of loyal women who believed\r\nin Christ, went to a place apart to pray.\r\n\r\n2  And when their silence ended Jesus said, Be on your guard; the\r\nleaven of the Pharisees is being thrown in every measure of the meal\r\nof life.\r\n\r\n3  It is a poison that will taint whatever it may touch; and it will\r\nblight the soul as sure as fumes of the Diabolos; it is hypocrisy.\r\n\r\n4  The Pharisees seem fair in speech, but they are diabolical in heart.\r\n\r\n5  And then they seem to think that thought is something they can lock\r\nwithin themselves.\r\n\r\n6  They do not seem to know that every thought and wish is photographed\r\nand then preserved within the Book of Life to be revealed at any time\r\nthe masters will.\r\n\r\n7  That which is thought, or wished, or done in darkest night shall be\r\nproclaimed in brightest day;\r\n\r\n8  That which is whispered in the ear within the secret place shall be\r\nmade known upon the streets.\r\n\r\n9  And in the judgment day when all the books are opened up, these men,\r\nand every other man, shall be a-judged, not by what they’ve said or\r\ndone,\r\n\r\n10  But by the way in which they used the thoughts of God, and how the\r\nethers of eternal love were made to serve;\r\n\r\n11  For men may make these ethers serve the carnal self, or serve the\r\nholy self within.\r\n\r\n12  Behold, these men may kill the body of this flesh; but what of\r\nthat? the flesh is but a transitory thing, and soon, by natural law,\r\nwill pass;\r\n\r\n13  Their slaughter only hastens nature’s work a little time.\r\n\r\n14  And when they kill the flesh they reach their bounds of power; they\r\ncannot kill the soul.\r\n\r\n15  But nature is the keeper of the soul as of the flesh, and in the\r\nharvest time of soul, the trees of life are all inspected by the judge;\r\n\r\n16  And every tree that bears no fruit of good is plucked up by the\r\nroots and cast into the flames.\r\n\r\n17  Who then shall you regard? Not him who has the power to kill the\r\nflesh, and nothing more.\r\n\r\n18  Regard the mighty one who has the power to dissolve both soul and\r\nbody in the flames of nature’s fire.\r\n\r\n19  But man is king; he may direct his thoughts, his loves, his life,\r\nand gain the prize of everlasting life.\r\n\r\n20  And you are not abandoned in your struggle for the crown of life.\r\nYour Father lives, and you shall live.\r\n\r\n21  God has a care for every living thing. He numbers stars, and suns,\r\nand moons;\r\n\r\n22  He numbers angels, men, and every thing below; the birds, the\r\nflowers, the trees;\r\n\r\n23  The very petals of the rose he knows by name, and every one is\r\nnumbered in his Book of Life;\r\n\r\n24  And every hair upon your head, and every drop of blood within your\r\nveins, he knows by number and by rythm.\r\n\r\n25  He hears the birdling’s call, the cricket’s chirp, the glow worm’s\r\nsong; and not a sparrow falls to earth without his knowledge and\r\nconsent.\r\n\r\n26  A sparrow seems a thing of little worth; yea, five of them are\r\nworth two farthings in the market place, and yet God cares for every\r\none of them.\r\n\r\n27  Will he not care much more for you who bear his image in your soul?\r\n\r\n28  Fear not to make confession of the Christ before the sons of men,\r\nand God will own you as his sons and daughters in the presence of the\r\nhost of heaven.\r\n\r\n29  If you deny the Christ before the sons of men, then God will not\r\nreceive you as his own before the hosts of heaven.\r\n\r\n30  And more I say, Fear not when men shall bring you up before the\r\nrulers of the land to answer for your faith.\r\n\r\n31  Behold, the Holy Breath shall teach you in your hour of need what\r\nyou should say, and what is best to leave unsaid.\r\n\r\n32  And then the Christines went again to teach the multitudes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 110.\r\n\r\n    _Miriam sings a song of victory.

Jesus reveals the\r\n      symbolic character of the journey of Israel from Egypt to\r\n      Canaan._\r\n\r\nAnd Miriam stood before the surging crowd, and casting up her eyes to\r\nheaven she sung anew the song of victory:\r\n\r\n2  Bring forth the harp, the vina and the lyre; bring forth the highest\r\nsounding cymbal, all ye choirs of heaven. Join in the song, the new,\r\nnew song.\r\n\r\n3  The Lord of hosts has stooped to hear the cries of men, and lo, the\r\ncitadel of Beelzebul is shaking as a leaf before the wind.\r\n\r\n4  The sword of Gideon is again unsheathed.\r\n\r\n5  The Lord, with his own hand has pulled far back the curtains of the\r\nnight; the sun of truth is flooding heaven and earth;\r\n\r\n6  The demons of the dark, of ignorance and death, are fleeing fast;\r\nare disappearing as the dew beneath the morning sun.\r\n\r\n7  God is our strength and song; is our salvation and our hope, and we\r\nwill build anew a house for him;\r\n\r\n8  Will cleanse our hearts, and purify their chambers, every one. We\r\nare the temple of the Holy Breath.\r\n\r\n9  We need no more a tent within the wilderness; no more a temple built\r\nwith hands.\r\n\r\n10  We do not seek the Holy Land, nor yet Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n11  We are the tent of God; we are his temple built without the sound\r\nof edged tools.\r\n\r\n12  We are the Holy Land; we are the New Jerusalem; Allelujah, praise\r\nthe Lord!\r\n\r\n13  And when the song was done the multitudes exclaimed, Praise God.\r\n\r\n14  And Jesus said, Behold the way!\r\n\r\n15  The sons of men have groped for ages in the darkness of Egyptian\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n16  The Pharaohs of sense have bound them with their chains.\r\n\r\n17  But God has whispered through the mists of time and told them of a\r\nland of liberty and love.\r\n\r\n18  And he has sent his Logos forth to light the way.\r\n\r\n19  The Red Sea rolls between the promised land and Egypt’s sands.\r\n\r\n20  The Red Sea is the carnal mind.\r\n\r\n21  Behold, the Logos reaches out his hand; the sea divides; the carnal\r\nmind is reft in twain; the sons of men walk through dry shod.\r\n\r\n22  The Pharaohs of sense would stay them in their flight; the waters\r\nof the sea return; the Pharaohs of sense are lost and men are free.\r\n\r\n23  For just a little while men tread the wilderness of Sin; the Logos\r\nleads the way;\r\n\r\n24  And when at last men stand upon the Jordan’s brink, these waters\r\nstay, and men step forth into their own.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 111.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus teaches. A man requests him to compel his brother to\r\n      deal justly. Jesus reveals the divine law, the power of truth\r\n      and the universality of possessions. Relates the parable of\r\n      the rich man and his abundant harvest._\r\n\r\nAnd Jesus taught the multitudes; and while he spoke a man stood forth\r\nand said,\r\n\r\n2  Rabboni, hear my plea: My father died and left a large estate; my\r\nbrother seized it all, and now refuses me my share.\r\n\r\n3  I pray that you will bid him do the right, and give me what is mine.\r\n\r\n4  And Jesus said, I am not come to be a judge in such affairs; I am no\r\nhenchman of the court.\r\n\r\n5  God sent me not to force a man to do the right.\r\n\r\n6  In every man there is a sense of right; but many men regard it not.\r\n\r\n7  The fumes that rise from selfishness have formed a crust about their\r\nsense of right that veils their inner light, so that they cannot\r\ncomprehend nor recognize the rights of other men.\r\n\r\n8  This veil you cannot tear away by force of arms, and there is naught\r\nthat can dissolve this crust but knowledge and the love of God.\r\n\r\n9  While men are in the mire, the skies seem far away; when men are on\r\nthe mountain top, the skies are near, and they can almost touch the\r\nstars.\r\n\r\n10  Then Jesus turned and to the twelve he said, Behold the many in the\r\nmire of carnal life!\r\n\r\n11  The leaven of truth will change the miry clay to solid rock, and\r\nmen can walk and find the path that leads up to the mountain top.\r\n\r\n12  You cannot haste; but you can scatter forth this leaven with a\r\ngenerous hand.\r\n\r\n13  When men have learned the truth that bears upon its face the law of\r\nright, then they will haste to give to every man his dues.\r\n\r\n14  Then to the people Jesus said, Take heed, and covet not. The wealth\r\nof men does not consist in what they seem to have--in lands, in silver\r\nand in gold.\r\n\r\n15  These things are only borrowed wealth. No man can corner up the\r\ngifts of God.\r\n\r\n16  The things of nature are the things of God, and what is God’s\r\nbelongs to every man alike.\r\n\r\n17  The wealth of soul lies in the purity of life, and in the wisdom\r\nthat descends from heaven.\r\n\r\n18  Behold, a rich man’s ground brought forth abundantly; his barns\r\nwere far too small to hold his grain, and to himself he said,\r\n\r\n19  What shall I do? I must not give my grain away; I must not let it\r\ngo to waste; and then he said,\r\n\r\n20  This will I do; I will tear down these little barns and build up\r\nlarger ones; there I will store away my grain and I will say,\r\n\r\n21  My soul take now your ease; you have enough for many years; eat,\r\ndrink and fill yourself and be content.\r\n\r\n22  But God looked down and saw the man; he saw his selfish heart and\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n23  You foolish man, this night your soul will quit its house of flesh;\r\nthen who will have your garnered wealth?\r\n\r\n24  You men of Galilee, lay not up treasures in the vaults of earth;\r\naccumulated wealth will blight your soul.\r\n\r\n25  God does not give men wealth to hoard away in secret vaults. Men\r\nare but stewards of God’s wealth, and they must use it for the common\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n26  To every steward who is true to self, to other men, to every thing\r\nthat is, the Lord will say, Well done.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 112.\r\n\r\n    _The Christines in the home of Mary of Magdala. Jesus calls his\r\n      disciples, “Little Flock,” and charges them to place their\r\n      affections on divine things. He teaches them regarding the\r\n      inner life._\r\n\r\nAnd Jesus left the multitudes and went with his disciples up to Mary’s\r\nhome; and as they sat about the board to dine he said,\r\n\r\n2  My little flock, fear not; it is your Father’s will that you shall\r\nrule the kingdom of the soul.\r\n\r\n3  A ruler in the house of God is servant of the Lord of hosts, and man\r\ncannot serve God except by serving men.\r\n\r\n4  A servant in the house of God cannot be servant in the house of\r\nwealth; nor in the synagogue of sense.\r\n\r\n5  If you are tied to lands, or bonds, or wealth of earth, your hearts\r\nare knit to things of earth; for where your treasures are there are\r\nyour hearts.\r\n\r\n6  Dispose of all your wealth, distribute it among the poor, and put\r\nyour trust in God, and you nor yours will ever come to want.\r\n\r\n7  This is a test of faith, and God will not accept the service of the\r\nfaithless one.\r\n\r\n8  The time is ripe; your Master comes upon the clouds; the eastern sky\r\nis glowing with his presence now.\r\n\r\n9  Put on reception robes; gird up your loins; trim up your lamps and\r\nfill them well with oil, and be prepared to meet your Lord; when you\r\nare ready, he will come.\r\n\r\n10  Thrice blessed are the servants who are ready to receive their Lord.\r\n\r\n11  Behold, for he will gird himself, and will prepare a sumptuous\r\nfeast for every one, and he himself will serve.\r\n\r\n12  It matters not when he shall come; it may be at the second watch;\r\nit may be at the third; but blessed are the servants who are ready to\r\nreceive.\r\n\r\n13  You cannot leave your door ajar and go to sleep, and wait in\r\nblissful ignorance of the fleeting time;\r\n\r\n14  For thieves will surely come and take away your goods and bind and\r\ncarry you away to robbers’ dens.\r\n\r\n15  And if you are not carried forth, the Master when he comes will not\r\nregard a sleeping guard as friend, but as a foe.\r\n\r\n16  Beloved, these are times when every man must be awake and at\r\nhis post, for none can tell the hour nor the day when man shall be\r\nrevealed.\r\n\r\n17  And Peter said, Lord is this parable for us, or for the multitudes?\r\n\r\n18  And Jesus said, Why need you ask? God is not man that he should\r\nshow respect for one and cast another off.\r\n\r\n19  Whoever will may come and gird himself, and trim his lamp, and find\r\na turret in the tower of life where he may watch, and be prepared to\r\nmeet the Lord.\r\n\r\n20  But you, as children of the light, have come, and you have learned\r\nthe language of the court, and may stand forth and lead the way.\r\n\r\n21  But you may wait, and think that you are ready to receive the Lord,\r\nand still he does not come.\r\n\r\n22  And you may grow impatient and begin to long for carnal ways again,\r\nand may begin to exercise your rule;\r\n\r\n23  To beat, and otherwise maltreat the servants of the house, and fill\r\nyourselves with wine and meat.\r\n\r\n24  And what will say the Lord when he shall come?\r\n\r\n25  Behold, for he will cast the faithless servant from his house; and\r\nmany years will come and go before he can be cleansed, and be thought\r\nworthy to receive his Lord.\r\n\r\n26  The servant who has come into the light, who knows the Master’s\r\nwill and does it not; the trusted guard who goes to sleep within the\r\nturret of the tower of life,\r\n\r\n27  Shall feel the lash of justice many times, while he who does not\r\nknow his Master’s will and does it not, will not receive the graver\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\n28  The man who comes and stands before the open door of opportunity\r\nand does not enter in, but goes his way,\r\n\r\n29  Will come again and find the door made fast, and when he calls, the\r\ndoor will open not,\r\n\r\n30  The guard will say, you had the pass-word once, but you threw it\r\naway and now the Master knows you not; depart.\r\n\r\n31  And verily I say to you, To whom much has been given, much is\r\nrequired; to whom a little has been given, a little only is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 113.\r\n\r\n    _In answer to a question of Lamaas Jesus teaches a lesson on\r\n      the reign of peace and the way to it through antagonisms.\r\n      The signs of the times. Guidance of the Holy Breath. The\r\n      Christines go to Bethsaida._\r\n\r\nNow, after they had dined, the guests and Jesus all were in a spacious\r\nhall in Mary’s home.\r\n\r\n2  And then Lamaas said, Pray, tell us Lord, is this the dawn of peace?\r\n\r\n3  Have we come forth unto the time when men will war no more?\r\n\r\n4  Are you, indeed, the Prince of Peace that holy men have said would\r\ncome?\r\n\r\n5  And Jesus said, Peace reigns today; it is the peace of death.\r\n\r\n6  A stagnant pool abides in peace. When waters cease to move they soon\r\nare ladened with the seeds of death; corruption dwells in every drop.\r\n\r\n7  The living waters always leap and skip about like lambs in spring.\r\n\r\n8  The nations are corrupt; they sleep within the arms of death and\r\nthey must be aroused before it is too late.\r\n\r\n9  In life we find antagonists at work. God sent me here to stir unto\r\nits depths the waters of the sea of life.\r\n\r\n10  Peace follows strife; I come to slay this peace of death. The\r\nprince of peace must first be prince of strife.\r\n\r\n11  This leaven of truth which I have brought to men will stir the\r\ndemons up, and nations, cities, families will be at war within\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n12  The five that have been dwelling in a home of peace will be\r\ndivided now, and two shall war with three;\r\n\r\n13  The son will stand against his sire; the mother and the daughter\r\nwill contend; yea, strife will reign in every home.\r\n\r\n14  The self and greed and doubt will rage into a fever heat, and then,\r\nbecause of me, the earth will be baptized in human blood.\r\n\r\n15  But right is king; and when the smoke is cleared away the nations\r\nwill learn war no more; the Prince of Peace will come to reign.\r\n\r\n16  Behold, the signs of what I say are in the sky; but men can see\r\nthem not.\r\n\r\n17  When men behold a cloud rise in the west they say, A shower of rain\r\nwill come and so it does; and when the wind blows from the south they\r\nsay, The weather will be hot; and it is so.\r\n\r\n18  Lo, men can read the signs of earth and sky, but they cannot\r\ndiscern the signs of Holy Breath; but you shall know.\r\n\r\n19  The storm of wrath comes on; the carnal man will seek a cause to\r\nhale you into court, and cast you into prison cells.\r\n\r\n20  And when these times shall come let wisdom guide; do not resent.\r\nResentment makes more strong the wrath of evil men.\r\n\r\n21  There is a little sense of justice and of mercy in the vilest men\r\nof earth.\r\n\r\n22  By taking heed to what you do and say and trusting in the guidance\r\nof the Holy Breath, you may inspire this sense to grow.\r\n\r\n23  You thus may make the wrath of men to praise the Lord.\r\n\r\n24  The Christines went their way, and came unto Bethsaida and taught.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 114.\r\n\r\n    _A great storm on the sea destroys many lives. Jesus makes an\r\n      appeal for aid, and the people give with a generous hand. In\r\n      answer to a lawyer’s question, Jesus gives the philosophy of\r\n      disasters._\r\n\r\nAs Jesus taught, a man stood forth and said, Rabboni, may I speak?\r\n\r\n2  And Jesus said, Say on. And then the man spoke out and said,\r\n\r\n3  A storm upon the sea last night wrecked many fishing boats, and\r\nscores of men went down to death, and, lo, their wives and children\r\nare in need;\r\n\r\n4  What can be done to help them in their sore distress?\r\n\r\n5  And Jesus said, A worthy plea. You men of Galilee, take heed. We may\r\nnot bring again to live these men, but we can succor those who looked\r\nto them for daily bread.\r\n\r\n6  You stewards of the wealth of God, an opportunity has come; unlock\r\nyour vaults; bring forth your hoarded gold; bestow it with a lavish\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n7  This wealth was laid aside for just such times as these; when it was\r\nneeded not, lo, it was yours to guard;\r\n\r\n8  But now it is not yours, for it belongs to those who are in want,\r\nand if you give it not you simply bring upon your heads the wrath of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n9  It is not charity to give to those who need; it is but honesty; it\r\nis but giving men their own.\r\n\r\n10  Then Jesus turned to Judas, one of the twelve, who was the\r\ntreasurer of the band, and said,\r\n\r\n11  Bring forth our treasure box; the money is not ours now; turn\r\nevery farthing to the help of those in such distress.\r\n\r\n12  Now, Judas did not wish to give the money all to those in want, and\r\nso he talked with Peter, James and John.\r\n\r\n13  He said, Lo, I will save a certain part and give the rest; that\r\nsurely is enough for us, for we are strangers to the ones in want; we\r\ndo not even know their names.\r\n\r\n14  But Peter said, Why, Judas, man, how do you dare to think to trifle\r\nwith the strength of right.\r\n\r\n15  The Lord has spoken true; this wealth does not belong to us in face\r\nof this distress, and to refuse to give it is to steal.\r\n\r\n16  You need not fear; we will not come to want.\r\n\r\n17  Then Judas opened up the treasure box and gave the money all.\r\n\r\n18  And there was gold and silver, food, and raiment in abundance for\r\nthe needs of the bereaved.\r\n\r\n19  A lawyer said, Rabboni, if God rules the worlds and all that in\r\nthem is, did he not bring about this storm? did he not slay these men?\r\n\r\n20  Has he not brought this sore distress upon these people here? and\r\nwas it done to punish them for crimes?\r\n\r\n21  And we remember well when once a band of earnest Jews from Galilee\r\nwere in Jerusalem, and at a feast and were, for fancied crimes against\r\nthe Roman law,\r\n\r\n22  Cut down within the very temple court by Pontius Pilate; and their\r\nblood became their sacrifice.\r\n\r\n23  Did God bring on this slaughter all because these men were doubly\r\nvile?\r\n\r\n24  And then we bring to mind that once a tower called Siloam, graced\r\nthe defences of Jerusalem, and, seemingly, without a cause it tottered\r\nand it fell to earth and eighteen men were killed.\r\n\r\n25  Were these men vile? and were they slain as punishment for some\r\ngreat crime?\r\n\r\n26  And Jesus said, We cannot look upon a single span of life and judge\r\nof anything.\r\n\r\n27  There is a law that men must recognize: Result depends on cause.\r\n\r\n28  Men are not motes to float about within the air of one short life,\r\nand then be lost in nothingness.\r\n\r\n29  They are undying parts of the eternal whole that come and go, lo,\r\nmany times into the air of earth and of the great beyond, just to\r\nunfold the God-like self.\r\n\r\n30  A cause may be a part of one brief life; results may not be noted\r\ntill another life.\r\n\r\n31  The cause of your results cannot be found within my life, nor can\r\nthe cause of my results be found in yours.\r\n\r\n32  I cannot reap except I sow and I must reap what e’er I sow,\r\n\r\n33  The law of all eternities is known to master minds:\r\n\r\n34  Whatever men do unto other men the judge and executioner will do to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n35  We do not note the execution of this law among the sons of men.\r\n\r\n36  We note the weak dishonored, trampled on and slain by those men\r\ncall the strong.\r\n\r\n37  We note that men with wood-like heads are seated in the chairs of\r\nstate;\r\n\r\n38  Are kings and judges, senators and priests, while men with giant\r\nintellects are scavengers about the streets.\r\n\r\n39  We note that women with a moiety of common sense, and not a whit\r\nof any other kind, are painted up and dressed as queens,\r\n\r\n40  Becoming ladies of the courts of puppet kings, because they have\r\nthe form of something beautiful; while God’s own daughters are their\r\nslaves, or serve as common laborers in the field.\r\n\r\n41  The sense of justice cries aloud: This is a travesty on right.\r\n\r\n42  So when men see no further than one little span of life it is no\r\nwonder that they say, There is no God, or if there is a God he is a\r\ntyrant and should die.\r\n\r\n43  If you would judge aright of human life, you must arise and stand\r\nupon the crest of time and note the thoughts and deeds of men as they\r\nhave come up through the ages past;\r\n\r\n44  For we must know that man is not a creature made of clay to turn\r\nagain to clay and disappear.\r\n\r\n45  He is a part of the eternal whole. There never was a time when he\r\nwas not; a time will never come when he will not exist.\r\n\r\n46  And now we look; the men who now are slaves were tyrants once; the\r\nmen who now are tyrants have been slaves.\r\n\r\n47  The men who suffer now, once stood aloft and shouted with a fiend’s\r\ndelight while others suffered at their hands.\r\n\r\n48  And men are sick, and halt, and lame, and blind because they once\r\ntransgressed the laws of perfect life, and every law of God must be\r\nfulfilled.\r\n\r\n49  Man may escape the punishment that seems but due for his misdoings\r\nin this life; but every deed and word and thought has its own metes\r\nand bounds,\r\n\r\n50  Is cause, and has its own results, and if a wrong be done, the doer\r\nof the wrong must make it right.\r\n\r\n51  And when the wrongs have all been righted then will man arise and\r\nbe at one with God.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 115.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus teaches by the sea. He relates the parable of the sower.\r\n      Tells why he teaches in parables. Explains the parable of the\r\n      sower. Relates the parable of the wheat and tares._\r\n\r\nAnd Jesus stood beside the sea and taught; the multitudes pressed\r\nclose upon him and he went into a boat that was near by and put a\r\nlittle ways from shore, and then he spoke in parables; he said,\r\n\r\n2  Behold, a sower took his seed and went into his field to sow.\r\n\r\n3  With lavish hand he scattered forth the seed and some fell in the\r\nhardened paths that men had made,\r\n\r\n4  And soon were crushed beneath the feet of other men; and birds came\r\ndown and carried all the seed away.\r\n\r\n5  Some seed fell on rocky ground where there was little soil; they\r\ngrew and soon the blades appeared and promised much;\r\n\r\n6  But then there was no depth of soil, no chance for nourishment, and\r\nin the heat of noonday sun they withered up and died.\r\n\r\n7  Some seed fell where thistles grew, and found no earth in which to\r\ngrow and they were lost;\r\n\r\n8  But other seed found lodgment in the rich and tender soil and grew\r\napace, and in the harvest it was found that some brought forth a\r\nhundred fold, some sixty fold, some thirty fold.\r\n\r\n9  They who have ears to hear may hear; they who have hearts to\r\nunderstand may know.\r\n\r\n10  Now, his disciples were beside him in the boat, and Thomas asked,\r\nWhy do you speak in parables?\r\n\r\n11  And Jesus said, My words, like every master’s words, are dual in\r\ntheir sense.\r\n\r\n12  To you who know the language of the soul, my words have meanings\r\nfar too deep for other men to comprehend.\r\n\r\n13  The other sense of what I say is all the multitude can understand;\r\nthese words are food for them; the inner thoughts are food for you.\r\n\r\n14  Let every one reach forth and take the food that he is ready to\r\nreceive.\r\n\r\n15  And then he spoke that all might hear; he said, Hear you the\r\nmeaning of the parable:\r\n\r\n16  Men hear my words and understand them not, and then the carnal self\r\npurloins the seed, and not a sign of spirit life appears.\r\n\r\n17  This is the seed that fell within the beaten paths of men.\r\n\r\n18  And others hear the words of life, and with a fiery zeal receive\r\nthem all; they seem to comprehend the truth and promise well;\r\n\r\n19  But troubles come; discouragements arise; there is no depth of\r\nthought; their good intentions wither up and die.\r\n\r\n20  These are the seeds that fell in stony ground.\r\n\r\n21  And others hear the words of truth and seem to know their worth;\r\nbut love of pleasure, reputation, wealth and fame fill all the soil;\r\nthe seeds are nourished not and they are lost.\r\n\r\n22  These are the seeds that fell among the thistles and the thorns.\r\n\r\n23  But others hear the words of truth and comprehend them well; they\r\nsink down deep into their souls; they live the holy life and all the\r\nworld is blest.\r\n\r\n24  These are the seeds that fell in fertile soil, that brought forth\r\nfruit abundantly.\r\n\r\n25  You men of Galilee, take heed to how you hear and how you cultivate\r\nyour fields; for if you slight the offers of this day, the sower may\r\nnot come to you again in this or in the age to come.\r\n\r\n26  Then Jesus spoke another parable; he said:\r\n\r\n27  The kingdom I may liken to a field in which a man sowed precious\r\nseed;\r\n\r\n28  But while he slept an evil one went forth and sowed a measure full\r\nof darnel seed; then went his way.\r\n\r\n29  The soil was good, and so the wheat and darnel grew; and when the\r\nservants saw the tares among the wheat, they found the owner of the\r\nfield and said,\r\n\r\n30  You surely sowed good seed; from whence these tares?\r\n\r\n31  The owner said, Some evil one has sown the seed of tares.\r\n\r\n32  The servants said, Shall we go out and pull up by the roots the\r\ntares and burn them in the fire?\r\n\r\n33  The owner said, No, that would not be well. The wheat and tares\r\ngrow close together in the soil, and while you pull the tares you\r\nwould destroy the wheat.\r\n\r\n34  So we will let them grow together till the harvest time. Then to\r\nthe reapers I will say,\r\n\r\n35  Go forth and gather up the tares and bind them up and burn them in\r\nthe fire, and gather all the wheat into my barns.\r\n\r\n36  When he had spoken thus, he left the boat and went up to the\r\nhouse, and his disciples followed him.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 116.\r\n\r\n    _The Christines are in Philip’s home. Jesus interprets the\r\n      parable of the wheat and tares. He explains the unfoldment\r\n      of the kingdom by parables: the good seed; the growth of the\r\n      tree; the leaven; the hidden treasure. He goes to a mountain\r\n      to pray._\r\n\r\nThe Christines were in Philip’s home and Peter said to Jesus, Lord,\r\nwill you explain to us the meaning of the parables you spoke today?\r\nThe one about the wheat and tares, especially?\r\n\r\n2  And Jesus said, God’s kingdom is a dualty; it has an outer and an\r\ninner form.\r\n\r\n3  As seen by man it is composed of men, of those who make confession\r\nof the name of Christ.\r\n\r\n4  For various reasons various people crowd this outer kingdom of our\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n5  The inner kingdom is the kingdom of the soul, the kingdom of the\r\npure in heart.\r\n\r\n6  The outer kingdom I may well explain in parables. Behold, for I have\r\nseen you cast a great net out into the sea,\r\n\r\n7  And when you hauled it in, lo, it was full of every kind of fish,\r\nsome good, some bad, some great, some small; and I have seen you save\r\nthe good and throw the bad away.\r\n\r\n8  This outer kingdom is the net, and every kind of man is caught; but\r\nin the sorting day the bad will all be cast away, the good reserved.\r\n\r\n9  Hear, then, the meaning of the parable of wheat and tares:\r\n\r\n10  The sower is the son of man; the field, the world; the good seed\r\nare the children of the light; the tares, the children of the dark;\r\nthe enemy, the carnal self; the harvest day, the closing of the age;\r\nthe reapers are the messengers of God.\r\n\r\n11  The reckoning day will come to every man; then will the tares be\r\ngathered up, and cast into the fire and be burned.\r\n\r\n12  Then will the good shine forth as suns in the kingdom of the soul.\r\n\r\n13  And Philip said, Must men and women suffer in the flames because\r\nthey have not found the way of life?\r\n\r\n14  And Jesus said, The fire purifies. The chemist throws into the fire\r\nthe ores that hold all kinds of dross.\r\n\r\n15  The useless metal seems to be consumed; but not a grain of gold is\r\nlost.\r\n\r\n16  There is no man that has not in him gold that cannot be destroyed.\r\nThe evil things of men are all consumed in fire; the gold survives.\r\n\r\n17  The inner kingdom of the soul I may explain in parables:\r\n\r\n18  The son of man goes forth and scatters seeds of truth; God waters\r\nwell the soil; the seeds show life and grow; first comes the blade,\r\nand then the stalk, and then the ear, and then the full wheat in the\r\near.\r\n\r\n19  The harvest comes and, lo, the reapers bear the ripened sheaves\r\ninto the garner of the Lord.\r\n\r\n20  Again, this kingdom of the soul is like a little seed that men may\r\nplant in fertile soil.\r\n\r\n21  (A thousand of these seeds would scarcely be a shekel’s weight.)\r\n\r\n22  The tiny seed begins to grow; it pushes through the earth, and\r\nafter years of growth it is a mighty tree and birds rest in its leafy\r\nbowers and men find refuge ’neath its sheltering boughs from sun and\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\n23  Again, the truth, the spirit of the kingdom of the soul, is like a\r\nball of leaven that a woman hid in measures, three, of flour and in a\r\nlittle time the whole was leavened.\r\n\r\n24  Again, the kingdom of the soul is like a treasure hidden in a field\r\nwhich one has found, and straitway goes his way and sells all that he\r\nhas and buys the field.\r\n\r\n25  When Jesus had thus said he went alone into a mountain pass near by\r\nto pray.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 117.\r\n\r\n    _A royal feast is held in Machaerus. John, the harbinger, is\r\n      beheaded. His body is buried in Hebron. His disciples mourn.\r\n      The Christines cross the sea in the night. Jesus calms a\r\n      raging storm._\r\n\r\nA royal feast was held in honor of the birthday of the tetrarch in\r\nfortified Machaerus, east of the Bitter Sea.\r\n\r\n2  The tetrarch, Herod, and his wife, Herodias, together with Salome\r\nwere there; and all the men and women of the royal court were there.\r\n\r\n3  And when the feast was done, lo, all the guests and courtiers were\r\ndrunk with wine; they danced and leaped about like children in their\r\nplay.\r\n\r\n4  Salome, daughter of Herodias, came in and danced before the king.\r\nThe beauty of her form, her grace and winning ways entranced the silly\r\nHerod, then half drunk with wine.\r\n\r\n5  He called the maiden to his side and said, Salome, you have won my\r\nheart, and you may ask and I will give you anything you wish.\r\n\r\n6  The maiden ran in childish glee and told her mother what the ruler\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n7  Her mother said, Go back and say, Give me the head of John, the\r\nharbinger.\r\n\r\n8  The maiden ran and told the ruler what she wished.\r\n\r\n9  And Herod called his trusty executioner and said to him, Go to the\r\ntower and tell the keeper that by my authority you come to execute the\r\nprisoner known as John.\r\n\r\n10  The man went forth and in a little while returned and on a platter\r\nbore the lifeless head of John, and Herod offered it unto the maiden\r\nin the presence of the guests.\r\n\r\n11  The maiden stood aloof; her innocence was outraged when she saw the\r\nbloody gift, and she would touch it not.\r\n\r\n12  Her mother, steeped and hardened well in crime, came up and took\r\nthe head and held it up before the guests and said,\r\n\r\n13  This is the fate of every man who dares to scorn, or criticize, the\r\nacts of him who reigns.\r\n\r\n14  The drunken rabble gazed upon the grewsome sight with fiendish joy.\r\n\r\n15  The head was taken back unto the tower. The body had been given\r\nunto holy men who had been friends of John; they placed it in a burial\r\ncase and carried it away.\r\n\r\n16  They bore it to the Jordan, which they crossed just at the ford\r\nwhere John first preached the word;\r\n\r\n17  And through the passes of the Judean hills they carried it.\r\n\r\n18  They reached the sacred grounds near Hebron, where the bodies of\r\nthe parents of the harbinger lay in their tombs;\r\n\r\n19  And there they buried it; and then they went their way.\r\n\r\n20  Now, when the news reached Galilee that John was dead the people\r\nmet to sing the sonnets of the dead.\r\n\r\n21  And Jesus and the foreign masters and the twelve took ship to cross\r\nthe sea of Galilee.\r\n\r\n22  A scribe, a faithful friend of John, stood by the sea; he called to\r\nJesus and he said, Rabboni, let me follow where you go.\r\n\r\n23  And Jesus said, You seek a safe retreat from evil men. There is no\r\nsafety for your life with me;\r\n\r\n24  For evil men will take my life as they have taken John’s.\r\n\r\n25  The foxes of the earth have safe retreats; the birds have nests\r\nsecure among the hidden rocks, but I have not a place where I may lay\r\nmy head and rest secure.\r\n\r\n26  Then an apostle said, Lord, suffer me to tarry here a while, that I\r\nmay take my father, who is dead, and lay him in the tomb.\r\n\r\n27  But Jesus said, The dead can care for those who die; the living\r\nwait for those who live; come, follow me.\r\n\r\n28  The evening came; three boats put out to sea and Jesus rested in\r\nthe foremost boat; he slept.\r\n\r\n29  A storm came on; the boats were tossed about like toys upon the sea.\r\n\r\n30  The waters swept the decks; the hardy boatmen were afraid lest all\r\nbe lost.\r\n\r\n31  And Thomas found the master fast asleep; he called, and Jesus woke.\r\n\r\n32  And Thomas said, Behold the storm! have you no care for us? The\r\nboats are going down.\r\n\r\n33  And Jesus stood; he raised his hand; he talked unto the spirits of\r\nthe winds and waves as men would talk with men.\r\n\r\n34  And, lo, the winds blew not; the waves came tremblingly and kissed\r\nhis feet; the sea was calm.\r\n\r\n35  And then he said, You men of faith, where is your faith? for you\r\ncan speak and winds and waves will hear and will obey.\r\n\r\n36  And the disciples were amazed. They said, Who is this man that even\r\nwinds and waves obey his voice?\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 118.\r\n\r\n    _The Christines are in Gadara. Jesus casts a legion of unclean\r\n      spirits out of a man. The spirits go into vicious animals\r\n      which run into the sea, and are drowned. The people are\r\n      in fear and request Jesus to leave their coast. With his\r\n      disciples, he returns to Capernaum._\r\n\r\nThe morning came; the Christines landed in the country of the\r\nGeracenes.\r\n\r\n2  They went to Gadara, chief city of the Peracans, and here for\r\ncertain days they tarried and they taught.\r\n\r\n3  Now, legends hold that Gadara is sacred to the dead, and all the\r\nhills about are known as holy ground.\r\n\r\n4  These are the burial grounds of all the regions round about; the\r\nhills are full of tombs; and many dead from Galilee are here entombed.\r\n\r\n5  Now, spirits of the lately dead that cannot rise to higher planes,\r\nremain about the tombs that hold the flesh and bones of what was once\r\ntheir mortal homes.\r\n\r\n6  They sometimes take possession of the living, whom they torture in a\r\nhundred ways.\r\n\r\n7  And all through Gadara were men obsessed, and there was no one\r\nstrong enough to bring relief.\r\n\r\n8  That they might meet these hidden foes and learn the way to\r\ndispossess the evil ones the master took the foreign masters and the\r\ntwelve into the tombs.\r\n\r\n9  And as they neared the gates they met a man obsessed. A legion of\r\nthe unclean ones were in this man, and they had made him strong;\r\n\r\n10  And none could bind him down, no, not with chains; for he could\r\nbreak the stoutest chains, and go his way.\r\n\r\n11  Now, unclean spirits cannot live in light; they revel in the dark.\r\n\r\n12  When Jesus came he brought the light of life, and all the evil\r\nspirits were disturbed.\r\n\r\n13  The leader of the legion in the man called out, Thou Jesus, thou\r\nImmanuel, we beg that thou wilt not consign it to the depths. Torment\r\nus not before our time.\r\n\r\n14  And Jesus said, What is your number and your name?\r\n\r\n15  The evil spirit said, Our name is legion, and our number is the\r\nnumber of the beast.\r\n\r\n16  And Jesus spoke; and with a voice that shook the very hills, he\r\nsaid, Come forth; possess this man no more.\r\n\r\n17  Now, all the hills were filled with unclean animals that fed, and\r\ncarried forth and spread the plague among the people of the land.\r\n\r\n18  And when the evil spirits begged that they might not be driven\r\nforth without a home, the master said,\r\n\r\n19  Go forth and take possession of the unclean quadrupeds.\r\n\r\n20  And they, and all the evil spirits of the tombs went forth and took\r\npossession of the breeders of the plague,\r\n\r\n21  Which, wild with rage, ran down the steeps into the sea, and all\r\nwere drowned.\r\n\r\n22  And all the land was freed of the contagion, and the unclean\r\nspirits came no more.\r\n\r\n23  But when the people saw the mighty works that Jesus did they were\r\nalarmed. They said,\r\n\r\n24  If he can free the country of the plague, and drive the unclean\r\nspirits out, he is a man of such transcendent power that he can\r\ndevastate our land at will.\r\n\r\n25  And then they came and prayed that he would not remain in Gadara.\r\n\r\n26  And Jesus did not tarry longer there, and with the other masters\r\nand the twelve, he went aboard the boats to go away.\r\n\r\n27  The man who had been rescued from the unclean legion stood upon the\r\nshore and said, Lord, let me go with you.\r\n\r\n28  But Jesus said, It is not well; go forth unto your home and tell\r\nthe news that men may know what man can do when he is tuned with God.\r\n\r\n29  And then the man went forth through all Decapolis and told the news.\r\n\r\n30  The Christines sailed away, re-crossed the sea and came again into\r\nCapernaum.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 119.\r\n\r\n    _The people of Capernaum welcome Jesus. Matthew gives a feast.\r\n      The Pharisees rebuke Jesus for eating with sinners. He tells\r\n      them that he is sent to save sinners. He gives lessons on\r\n      fasting and on the philosophy of good and evil._\r\n\r\nThe news soon spread through all the land that Jesus was at home and\r\nthen the people came in throngs to welcome him.\r\n\r\n2  And Matthew, one of the twelve, a man of wealth, whose home was in\r\nCapernaum, spread forth a sumptuous feast, and Jesus and the foreign\r\nmasters and the twelve, and people of all shades of thought, were\r\nguests.\r\n\r\n3  And when the Pharisees observed that Jesus sat and ate with\r\npublicans and those of ill repute they said,\r\n\r\n4  For shame! This man who claims to be a man of God, consorts with\r\npublicans and courtesans and with the common herd of men, For shame!\r\n\r\n5  When Jesus knew their thoughts he said, They who are well cannot be\r\nhealed; the pure need not be saved.\r\n\r\n6  They who are well are whole; they who are pure are saved.\r\n\r\n7  They who love justice and do right need not repent; I came not unto\r\nthem, but to the sinner I am come.\r\n\r\n8  A band of John’s disciples who had heard that John was dead were\r\nwearing badges for their dead;\r\n\r\n9  Were fasting and were praying in their hearts, which when the\r\nPharisees observed they came to Jesus and they said,\r\n\r\n10  Why fast the followers of John and your disciples do not fast?\r\n\r\n11  And Jesus said, Lo, you are masters of the law; you ought to know;\r\nperhaps you will make known your knowledge to these men.\r\n\r\n12  What are the benefits derived from fasts? The Pharisees were mute;\r\nthey answered not.\r\n\r\n13  Then Jesus said, The vital force of men depends on what they eat\r\nand drink.\r\n\r\n14  Is spirit-life the stronger when the vital force is weak? Is\r\nsainthood reached by starving, self imposed?\r\n\r\n15  A glutton is a sinner in the sight of God, and he is not a saint\r\nwho makes himself a weakling and unfitted for the heavy tasks of life\r\nby scorning to make use of God’s own means of strength.\r\n\r\n16  Lo, John is dead, and his devoted followers are fasting in their\r\ngrief.\r\n\r\n17  Their love for him impels them on to show respect, for they have\r\nthought, and have been taught that it is sin to lightly treat the\r\nmemory of the dead.\r\n\r\n18  To them it is a sin, and it is well that they should fast.\r\n\r\n19  When men defy their consciences and listen not to what they say,\r\nthe heart is grieved and they become unfitted for the work of life;\r\nand thus they sin.\r\n\r\n20  The conscience may be taught. One man may do in conscience what\r\nanother cannot do.\r\n\r\n21  What is a sin for me to do may not be sin for you to do. The place\r\nyou occupy upon the way of life determines what is sin.\r\n\r\n22  There is no changeless law of good; for good and evil both are\r\njudged by other things.\r\n\r\n23  One man may fast and in his deep sincerity of heart is blest.\r\n\r\n24  Another man may fast and in the faithlessness of such a task\r\nimposed is cursed.\r\n\r\n25  You cannot make a bed to fit the form of every man. If you can make\r\na bed to fit yourself you have done well.\r\n\r\n26  Why should these men who follow me resort to fasting, or to\r\nanything that would impair their strength? They need it all to serve\r\nthe race.\r\n\r\n27  The time will come when God will let you have your way, and you\r\nwill do to me what Herod did to John;\r\n\r\n28  And in the awfulness of that sad hour these men will fast.\r\n\r\n29  They who have ears to hear may hear; they who have hearts to feel\r\nmay understand.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 120.\r\n\r\n    _Nicodemus is at the feast. He asks Jesus, Cannot the Christine\r\n      religion be introduced more successfully by reforming the\r\n      Jewish service? Jesus answers in the negative and gives his\r\n      reasons. Jesus heals a woman with hemorrhages. Heals Jairus’\r\n      daughter. Disappears when the people would worship him._\r\n\r\nNow, Nicodemus, who once came to Jesus in the night to learn the way\r\nof life, was one among the guests.\r\n\r\n2  And standing forth he said, Rabboni, it is true that Jewish laws and\r\nJewish practices do not agree.\r\n\r\n3  The priesthood needs to be reformed; the rulers should become more\r\nmerciful and kind; the lawyers should become more just; the common\r\npeople should not bear such loads.\r\n\r\n4  But could we not gain these reforms and not destroy the service of\r\nthe Jews?\r\n\r\n5  Could you not harmonize your mighty work with that of Pharisee\r\nand scribe? Might not the priesthood be a benefit to your divine\r\nphilosophy?\r\n\r\n6  But Jesus said, You cannot put new wine in ancient skins, for when\r\nit purifies itself, lo, it expands; the ancient bottles cannot bear\r\nthe strain; they burst, and all the wine is lost.\r\n\r\n7  Men do not mend a wornout garment with a piece of cloth unworn,\r\nwhich cannot yield to suit the fabric, weak with age, and then a\r\ngreater rent appears.\r\n\r\n8  Old wine may be preserved in ancient skins; but new wine calls for\r\nbottles new.\r\n\r\n9  This spirit-truth I bring is to this generation new, and if we put\r\nit in the ancient skins of Jewish forms, lo, it will all be lost.\r\n\r\n10  It must expand; the ancient bottles cannot yield and they would\r\nburst.\r\n\r\n11  Behold the kingdom of the Christ! it is as old as God himself, and\r\nyet it is as new as morning sun; it only can contain the truth of God.\r\n\r\n12  And as he spoke a ruler of the synagogue, Jairus by name, came in\r\nand bowed at Jesus’ feet and said,\r\n\r\n13  My master, hear my prayer! My child is very sick, I fear that she\r\nwill die; but this I know that if you will but come and speak the Word\r\nmy child will live.\r\n\r\n14  (She was an only child, a girl twelve years of age.)\r\n\r\n15  And Jesus tarried not; he went out with the man, and many people\r\nfollowed them.\r\n\r\n16  And as they went a woman who had been plagued with hemorrhage for\r\nmany years, had been a subject of experiment of doctors near and far,\r\nand all had said, She cannot live, rose from her bed and rushed out in\r\nthe way as Jesus passed.\r\n\r\n17  She said within herself, If I can touch his garment, then I know I\r\nwill be well.\r\n\r\n18  She touched him, and at once the bleeding ceased and she was well.\r\n\r\n19  And Jesus felt that healing power had gone from him, and speaking\r\nto the multitude, he said,\r\n\r\n20  Who was it touched my coat?\r\n\r\n21  And Peter said, No one can tell; the multitudes are pressing you; a\r\nscore of people may have touched your coat.\r\n\r\n22  But Jesus said, Some one in faith, with healing thought, did touch\r\nmy coat, for healing virtues have gone forth from me.\r\n\r\n23  And when the woman knew that what she did was known, she came and\r\nknelt at Jesus’ feet and told it all.\r\n\r\n24  And Jesus said, Your faith has made you whole, go on your way in\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n25  Now, as he spoke, a servant from the home of Jairus came and said,\r\nMy master, Jairus, trouble not the Lord to come; your child is dead.\r\n\r\n26  But Jesus said, Jairus, man of faith, do not permit your faith to\r\nwaver in this trying hour.\r\n\r\n27  What is it that the servant said? The child is dead? Lo, what is\r\ndeath?\r\n\r\n28  It is the passing of the soul out of the house of flesh.\r\n\r\n29  Man is the master of the soul and of its house. When man has risen\r\nup from doubt and fear, lo, he can cleanse the empty house and bring\r\nthe tenant back again.\r\n\r\n30  Then taking with him Peter, James and John, Jairus and the mother\r\nof the child, he went into the chamber of the dead.\r\n\r\n31  And when the doors were closed against the multitude, he spoke a\r\nword that souls can understand, and then he took the maiden by the\r\nhand and said,\r\n\r\n32  Talitha cumi, child, arise! The maiden’s soul returned and she\r\narose and asked for food.\r\n\r\n33  And all the people of the city were amazed, and many would have\r\nworshipped Jesus as a God,\r\n\r\n34  But, like a phantom of the night, he disappeared and went his way.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 121.\r\n\r\n    _The Christines are in Nazareth. Miriam sings a Christine song\r\n      of praise. Jesus teaches in the synagogue. He heals a dumb\r\n      man who is obsessed. The people do not believe in him. The\r\n      Pharisees call him a tool of Beelzebul. The Christines go to\r\n      Cana._\r\n\r\nIt was a gala day in Nazareth. The people there had met with one\r\naccord to celebrate some great event.\r\n\r\n2  And Jesus and the foreign masters and the twelve, and Mary, mother\r\nof the Lord, and Miriam were there.\r\n\r\n3  And when the people were assembled in the great hall of the town,\r\nthe graceful singer, Miriam, stood forth and sung a song of praise.\r\n\r\n4  But few of all the multitude knew who the singer was; but instantly\r\nshe won all hearts.\r\n\r\n5  For many days she sung the songs of Israel, and then she went her\r\nway.\r\n\r\n6  The Sabbath came and Jesus went into the synagogue. He took the book\r\nof Psalms and read:\r\n\r\n7  Blest is the man who puts his trust in God, respecting not the proud\r\nnor such as turn aside to lies.\r\n\r\n8  O Lord, my God, the works that thou hast done for us are wonderful;\r\nand many are thy thoughts for us; we cannot count them all,\r\n\r\n9  Thou dost not call for sacrifice, nor offerings of blood; burnt\r\nofferings and offerings for sin thou dost not want;\r\n\r\n10  And lo, I come to do thy will, O God; thy law is in my heart,\r\n\r\n11  And I have preached the word of righteousness and peace unto the\r\nthronging multitudes; I have declared the counsel of my God in full.\r\n\r\n12  I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared\r\nthy faithfulness and grace.\r\n\r\n13  I have not kept thy loving-kindness and thy truth away from men; I\r\nhave declared them to the multitudes.\r\n\r\n14  O Lord, make wide my lips that I may tell thy praise; I do not\r\nbring the sacrifice of blood, nor yet burnt offerings for sin.\r\n\r\n15  The sacrifices I would bring to thee, O God, are purity in life, a\r\ncontrite heart, a spirit full of faith and love; and these thou wilt\r\nreceive.\r\n\r\n16  And when he had thus read, he gave the book back to the keeper of\r\nthe books, and then he said,\r\n\r\n17  Upon these ends of earth these messages of God have come.\r\n\r\n18  Our people have exalted sacrificial rites and have neglected mercy,\r\njustice and the rights of men.\r\n\r\n19  You Pharisees, you priests, you scribes, your God is surfeited with\r\nblood; God does not heed your prayers; you stand before your burning\r\nvictims; but you stand in vain.\r\n\r\n20  Turn you unto the testimonies of the law; reform and turn to God,\r\nand you shall live.\r\n\r\n21  Let not your altars be accursed again with smoke of innocence.\r\n\r\n22  Bring unto God as sacrifice a broken and a contrite heart.\r\n\r\n23  Lift from your fellow men the burdens that you have imposed.\r\n\r\n24  And if you hearken not, and if you turn not from your evil ways,\r\nlo, God will smite this nation with a curse.\r\n\r\n25  And when he had thus said he stood aside, and all the people were\r\nastonished, and they said,\r\n\r\n26  Where did this man get all his knowledge and his power? From whence\r\ndid all this wisdom come?\r\n\r\n27  Is not this Mary’s son, whose home is out on Marmion Way?\r\n\r\n28  Are not his brothers, Jude and James and Simon, known among our\r\nhonored men? Are not his sisters with us here?\r\n\r\n29  But they were all offended by the words he spoke.\r\n\r\n30  And Jesus said, A prophet has no honor in his native land; he is\r\nnot well received among his kin; his foes are in his home.\r\n\r\n31  And Jesus wrought not many mighty works in Nazareth, because the\r\npeople had no faith in him. He did not tarry long.\r\n\r\n32  But as he passed from thence two blind men followed him and cried,\r\nThou son of David, hear! Have mercy, Lord, and open up our eyes that\r\nwe may see.\r\n\r\n33  And Jesus said, Do you believe that I can open up your eyes and\r\nmake you see?\r\n\r\n34  They said, Yea, Lord, we know that if you speak the Word then we\r\ncan see.\r\n\r\n35  And Jesus touched their eyes and spoke the Word; he said, According\r\nto your faith so will it be.\r\n\r\n36  And they were blest; they opened up their eyes and saw.\r\n\r\n37  And Jesus said, Tell not this thing to any one.\r\n\r\n38  But they went forth and told the news through all the land.\r\n\r\n39  As Jesus walked along the way a man who was obsessed, and who was\r\ndumb, was brought to him.\r\n\r\n40  And Jesus spoke the Word; the unclean spirit came out of the man;\r\nhis tongue was loosed; he spoke; he said, Praise God.\r\n\r\n41  The people were amazed; They said, This is a mighty deed; we never\r\nsaw that done before.\r\n\r\n42  The Pharisees were also much amazed; but they cried out and said,\r\n\r\n43  You men of Israel, take heed; this Jesus is a tool of Beelzebul; he\r\nheals the sick and casts the spirits out in Satan’s name.\r\n\r\n44  But Jesus answered not; he went his way.\r\n\r\n45  And with the foreign masters and the twelve he went up to the town\r\nwhere he once turned the water into wine and tarried certain days.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 122.\r\n\r\n    _The Christines spend seven days in prayer. Jesus gives his\r\n      charge to the twelve and sends them forth on their apostolic\r\n      ministry, with instructions to meet him in Capernaum._\r\n\r\nThe Christines prayed in silence seven days; then Jesus called the\r\ntwelve aside and said,\r\n\r\n2  Behold, the multitudes have thronged about us everywhere; the people\r\nare bewildered; they wander here and there like sheep without a fold.\r\n\r\n3  They need a shepherd’s care; they want a loving hand to lead them to\r\nthe light.\r\n\r\n4  The grain is ripe; the harvest is abundant, but the harvesters are\r\nfew.\r\n\r\n5  The time is also ripe, and you must go alone through all the\r\nvillages and towns of Galilee and teach and heal.\r\n\r\n6  And then he breathed upon the twelve and said, Receive the Holy\r\nBreath.\r\n\r\n7  And then he gave them each the Word of power, and said, By this\r\nOmnific Word you shall cast spirits out, shall heal the sick and bring\r\nthe dead to life again.\r\n\r\n8  And you shall go not in the way of the Assyrians, nor Greek; you\r\nshall not go into Samaria; go only to your brethren of the scattered\r\ntribes.\r\n\r\n9  And as you go proclaim, The kingdom of the Christ has come.\r\n\r\n10  You have abundantly received, and freely you shall give.\r\n\r\n11  But you must go in faith; provide yourselves no crutch to lean upon.\r\n\r\n12  Give all your gold and silver to the poor; take not two coats, nor\r\nextra shoes; just take your wands.\r\n\r\n13  You are God’s husbandmen and he will never suffer you to want.\r\n\r\n14  In every place you go search out the men of faith; with them abide\r\nuntil you go from hence.\r\n\r\n15  You go for me; you act for me. They who receive and welcome you,\r\nreceive and welcome me;\r\n\r\n16  And they who shut their doors against your face, refuse to welcome\r\nme.\r\n\r\n17  If you are not received in kindness in a town, bear not away an\r\nevil thought; do not resist.\r\n\r\n18  An evil thought of any kind will do you harm; will dissipate your\r\npower.\r\n\r\n19  When you are not received with favor, go your way, for there are\r\nmultitudes of men who want the light.\r\n\r\n20  Behold, I send you forth as sheep among a pack of wolves; and you\r\nmust be as wise as serpents and as harmless as the doves.\r\n\r\n21  In all your language be discreet, for Pharisees and scribes will\r\nseek a cause for your arrest in what you say.\r\n\r\n22  And they will surely find a way by charges false to bring you into\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n23  And judges will declare that you are guilty of some crime, and\r\nsentence you to scourgings and to prison cells.\r\n\r\n24  But when you come to stand before the judge, be not afraid; be not\r\ndisturbed about the way to act, the words to speak.\r\n\r\n25  The Holy Breath will guide you in that hour, and give the words\r\nthat you shall speak.\r\n\r\n26  Of this be full assured; It is not you who speaks; it is the Holy\r\nBreath who gives the words and moves the lips.\r\n\r\n27  The gospel that you preach will not bring peace, but it will stir\r\nthe multitudes to wrath.\r\n\r\n28  The carnal man abhors the truth, and he would give his life to\r\ncrush the tender plant before the harvest time.\r\n\r\n29  And this will bring confusion in the homes that were the homes of\r\nstagnant peace.\r\n\r\n30  And brother will give brother up to death; the father will stand\r\nby and see men execute his child; and in the courts the child will\r\ntestify against the sire, and gladly see its mother put to death.\r\n\r\n31  And men will hate you just because you speak the name of Christ.\r\n\r\n32  Thrice blessed is the man who shall be faithful in this coming day\r\nof wrath!\r\n\r\n33  Go now; when you are persecuted in a place, go seek another place.\r\n\r\n34  And when you meet a foe too great for you, behold, the son of man\r\nis at your door, and he can speak, and all the hosts of heaven will\r\nstand in your defense.\r\n\r\n35  But do not hold your present life in great esteem.\r\n\r\n36  The time will come when men will take my life; you need not hope to\r\nbe immune, for they will slay you in the name of God.\r\n\r\n37  Men call me Beelzebul and they will call you imps.\r\n\r\n38  Be not afraid of what men say and do; they have no power over soul;\r\nthey may abuse and may destroy the body of the flesh; but that is all.\r\n\r\n39  They do not know the God who holds the issues of the soul within\r\nhis hands, who can destroy the soul.\r\n\r\n40  The Christ is king today, and men must recognize his power.\r\n\r\n41  He who loves not the Christ, which is the love of God, before all\r\nelse, can never gain the prize of spirit consciousness.\r\n\r\n42  And they who love their parents or their children more than they\r\nlove the Christ can never wear the name of Christ.\r\n\r\n43  And he who loves his life more than he loves the Christ cannot\r\nplease God.\r\n\r\n44  And he who clings to life shall lose his life, while he who gives\r\nhis life for Christ will save his life.\r\n\r\n45  When Jesus had thus said he sent the twelve away by twos, and bade\r\nthem meet him in Capernaum.\r\n\r\n46  And they went out through all the towns of Galilee and taught and\r\nhealed in spirit and in power.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 123.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus gives his final charge to the foreign masters and sends\r\n      them forth as apostles to the world. He goes alone to Tyre\r\n      and abides in Rachel’s home. Heals an obsessed child. Goes\r\n      to Sidon and then to the mountains of Lebanon. Visits Mount\r\n      Hermon, Cæsarea-Philippi, Decapolis, Gadara and returns to\r\n      Capernaum. Receives the twelve, who give an account of their\r\n      work._\r\n\r\nThe Christine master spent a time in prayer and then he called the\r\nforeign masters, and he said to them,\r\n\r\n2  Behold, I sent the twelve apostles unto Israel, but you are sent to\r\nall the world.\r\n\r\n3  Our God is one, is Spirit and is truth, and every man is dear to him.\r\n\r\n4  He is the God of every child of India, and the farther east; of\r\nPersia, and the farther north; of Greece and Rome and of the farther\r\nwest; of Egypt and the farther south, and of the mighty lands across\r\nthe seas, and of the islands of the seas.\r\n\r\n5  If God would send the bread of life to one and not to all who have\r\narisen to the consciousness of life and can receive the bread of life,\r\nthen he would be unjust and that would shake the very throne of heaven.\r\n\r\n6  So he has called you from the seven centers of the world, and he has\r\nbreathed the breath of wisdom and of power into your souls, and now he\r\nsends you forth as bearers of the light of life, apostles of the human\r\nrace.\r\n\r\n7  Go on your way, and as you go proclaim the gospel of the Christ.\r\n\r\n8  And then he breathed upon the masters and he said, Receive the Holy\r\nBreath; and then he gave to each the Word of power.\r\n\r\n9  And each went on his way, and every land was blest.\r\n\r\n10  Then Jesus went alone across the hills of Galilee and after certain\r\ndays he reached the coast of Tyre, and in the home of Rachel he abode.\r\n\r\n11  He did not advertise his coming, for he did not come to teach; he\r\nwould commune with God where he could see the waters of the Mighty Sea.\r\n\r\n12  But Rachel told the news and multitudes of people thronged her home\r\nto see the Lord.\r\n\r\n13  A Grecian woman of Phenecia came; her daughter was obsessed. She\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n14  O Lord, have mercy on my home! My daughter is obsessed; but this I\r\nknow, if you will speak the Word she will be free. Thou son of David,\r\nhear my prayer!\r\n\r\n15  But Rachel said, Good woman, trouble not the Lord. He did not come\r\nto Tyre to heal; he came to talk with God beside the sea.\r\n\r\n16  And Jesus said, Lo, I was sent not to the Greek, nor to\r\nSyrophenicians; I come just to my people, Israel.\r\n\r\n17  And then the woman fell down at his feet and said, Lord, Jesus, I\r\nimplore that you will save my child.\r\n\r\n18  And Jesus said, You know the common proverb well: It is not meet\r\nthat one should give the children’s bread to dogs.\r\n\r\n19  And then the woman said, Yea, Jesus, this I know, but dogs may eat\r\nthe crumbs that fall down from their master’s board.\r\n\r\n20  And Jesus said, Such faith I have not seen, no not among the Jews;\r\nshe is not serf, nor dog.\r\n\r\n21  And then he said to her, According to your faith so let it be.\r\n\r\n22  The woman went her way and when she came unto her child, lo, she\r\nwas healed.\r\n\r\n23  And Jesus tarried many days in Tyre; and then he went his way and\r\ndwelt a time in Sidon by the sea.\r\n\r\n24  And then he journeyed on. In Lebanon hills and vales, and in its\r\ngroves he walked in silent thought.\r\n\r\n25  His earthly mission fast was drawing to a close; he sought for\r\nstrength, and what he sought he found.\r\n\r\n26  Mount Hermon stood beyond, and Jesus fain would kneel beside that\r\nmountain famed in Hebrew song.\r\n\r\n27  And then he stood upon Mount Hermon’s lofty peaks, and lifting up\r\nhis eyes to heaven he talked with God.\r\n\r\n28  And masters of the olden times revealed themselves and long they\r\ntalked about the kingdom of the Christ;\r\n\r\n29  About the mighty works that had been done; about the coming\r\nconquest of the cross; about the victory over death.\r\n\r\n30  Then Jesus journeyed on; he went to Cæsarea-Philippi, and in\r\nSusanna’s home he tarried certain days.\r\n\r\n31  And then he went through all Decapolis to give encouragement to\r\nthose who knew him as the Christ, and to prepare them for the day of\r\nCalvary.\r\n\r\n32  And then he went to Gadara, and many friends were there, to welcome\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n33  And Chuzas, steward of the house of Herod Antipas, was there, and\r\nJesus went aboard the royal ship with him and crossed the sea, and\r\ncame unto Capernaum.\r\n\r\n34  And when the people knew that Jesus was at home they came to\r\nwelcome him.\r\n\r\n35  In just a little while the twelve apostles came and told the master\r\nall about their journey over Galilee.\r\n\r\n36  They said that by the sacred Word they had done many mighty works;\r\nand Jesus said to them, Well done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XVII.\r\n\r\nPE.\r\n\r\n_The Third Annual Epoch of the Christine Ministry of Jesus._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 124.\r\n\r\n    _The Christines cross the sea.

Jesus, walking on the waters, comes to them. Trial of\r\n      Peter’s faith. They land in Gennesaret._\r\n\r\nThe twelve apostles now had reached the stage of spirit consciousness,\r\nand Jesus could reveal to them the deeper meanings of his mission to\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n2  Next week the great feast of the Jews would be observed, and Matthew\r\nsaid, Shall we not girt ourselves and go unto Jerusalem?\r\n\r\n3  But Jesus said, We will not go up to the feast; the time is short\r\nand I have many things to say to you; come you apart into a desert\r\nplace and rest a while.\r\n\r\n4  And then they took their boats and crossed the sea, and came into a\r\ndesert place near Julius Bethsaida.\r\n\r\n5  The people saw them go, and in vast multitudes they followed them.\r\n\r\n6  And Jesus had compassion on the anxious throng, and he stood forth\r\nand taught them all the day, because they sought the light and were\r\nlike sheep without a fold.\r\n\r\n7  And as the night came on the twelve were doubting what the\r\nmultitudes would do, and Thomas said,\r\n\r\n8  Lord, we are in a desert place; the multitudes have naught to eat\r\nand they are faint from lack of food; what shall we do?\r\n\r\n9  And Jesus said, Go to and feed the multitudes.\r\n\r\n10  And Judas said, Shall we go down and buy two hundred pennies’ worth\r\nof bread for them to eat?\r\n\r\n11  And Jesus said, Go look into our larder and see how many loaves we\r\nhave.\r\n\r\n12  And Andrew said, We have no bread, but we have found a lad who has\r\nfive barley loaves and two small fish; but this would not be food\r\nenough for one in ten.\r\n\r\n13  But Jesus said, Command these people all to sit upon the grass in\r\ncompanies of twelve; and they all sat down in companies of twelve.\r\n\r\n14  Then Jesus took the loaves and fish, and looking up to heaven he\r\nspoke the sacred Word.\r\n\r\n15  And then he broke the bread and gave it to the twelve; he also gave\r\nthe fish unto the twelve, and said, Go to and feed the multitudes.\r\n\r\n16  And all the people ate and were refreshed.\r\n\r\n17  There were about five thousand men, a company of little ones, and\r\nwomen not a few.\r\n\r\n18  And when the people all were filled the master said,\r\n\r\n19  Let not a crumb be lost; Go to and gather up the pieces of the\r\nbread and fish for others that may want.\r\n\r\n20  They gathered up the fragments and they filled twelve baskets full.\r\n\r\n21  The people were bewildered by this wondrous act of power; they\r\nsaid, And now we know that Jesus is the prophet that our prophets said\r\nwould come; and then they said, All hail the king!\r\n\r\n22  When Jesus heard them say, All hail the king! he called the twelve\r\nand bade them take their boats and go before him to the other side;\r\n\r\n23  And he went all alone into a mountain pass to pray.\r\n\r\n24  The twelve were on the sea and hoped to reach Capernaum in just a\r\nlittle time, when all at once a fearful storm arose, and they were at\r\nthe mercy of the waves.\r\n\r\n25  And in the fourth watch of the night the wind became a whirling\r\nwind, and they were filled with fear.\r\n\r\n26  And in the blinding storm they saw a form move on the waves; it\r\nseemed to be a man, and one spoke out and said, It is a ghost, a sign\r\nof evil things.\r\n\r\n27  But John discerned the form and said, It is the Lord.\r\n\r\n28  And then the wind blew not so hard, and Peter, standing in the\r\nmidst, exclaimed,\r\n\r\n29  My Lord! my Lord! If this be truly you, bid me to come to you upon\r\nthe waves.\r\n\r\n30  The form reached forth his hand and said, Come on.\r\n\r\n31  And Peter stepped upon the waves and they were solid as a rock; he\r\nwalked upon the waves.\r\n\r\n32  He walked until he thought within himself, What if the waves should\r\nbreak beneath my feet?\r\n\r\n33  And then the waves did break beneath his feet, and he began to\r\nsink, and in the fearfulness of soul he cried, O save me, Lord, or I\r\nam lost!\r\n\r\n34  And Jesus took him by the hand and said, O you of little faith! why\r\ndid you doubt? And Jesus led the way unto the boat.\r\n\r\n35  The storm had spent its force; the winds were still, and they\r\nwere near the shore, and when they landed they were in the valley of\r\nGennesaret.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 125.\r\n\r\n    _The Christines are welcomed in Gennesaret. Many follow Jesus\r\n      for the loaves and fish. He tells them of the bread of\r\n      life. Speaks of his flesh and blood as symbols of the bread\r\n      and water of life. The people are offended and many of his\r\n      disciples follow him no more._\r\n\r\nThe news soon spread through all the valley of Gennesaret that Jesus\r\nand the twelve had come, and many people came to see.\r\n\r\n2  They brought their sick and laid them at the master’s feet, and all\r\nthe day he taught and healed.\r\n\r\n3  The multitudes upon the other side who had been fed the day before\r\nand other multitudes, went down to see the Lord; but when they found\r\nhim not they sought him in Capernaum.\r\n\r\n4  And when they found him not at home, they went on to Gennesaret.\r\nThey found him there and said, Rabboni, when came you to Gennesaret?\r\n\r\n5  And Jesus said, Why are you come across the sea? you came not for\r\nthe bread of life;\r\n\r\n6  You came to gratify your selfish selves; you all were fed the other\r\nday across the sea, and you are after more of loaves and fish.\r\n\r\n7  The food you ate was nourishment for flesh that soon must pass away.\r\n\r\n8  You men of Galilee, seek not for food that perishes, but seek for\r\nfood that feeds the soul; and, lo, I bring you food from heaven.\r\n\r\n9  You ate the flesh of fish, and you were satisfied, and now I bring\r\nthe flesh of Christ for you to eat that you may live forevermore.\r\n\r\n10  Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; and then they ate the\r\nflesh of quail, and drank the waters of a flowing spring that Moses\r\nbrought out from the rock; but all of them are dead.\r\n\r\n11  The manna and the quail were symbols of the flesh of Christ; the\r\nwaters of the rock were symbols of the blood.\r\n\r\n12  But, lo, the Christ has come; he is the bread of life that God has\r\ngiven to the world.\r\n\r\n13  Whoever eats the flesh of Christ and drinks his blood shall never\r\ndie; and he will hunger nevermore; and he will thirst no more.\r\n\r\n14  And they who eat this bread of heaven, and drink these waters from\r\nthe spring of life cannot be lost; these feed the soul, and purify the\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n15  Behold, for God has said, When man has purified himself I will\r\nexalt him to the throne of power.\r\n\r\n16  Then Jesus and the twelve went to Capernaum; and Jesus went into\r\nthe synagogue and taught.\r\n\r\n17  And when the Jews, who heard him in Gennesaret, were come they said,\r\n\r\n18  This fellow is beside himself. We heard him say, I am the bread of\r\nlife that comes from heaven; and we all know that he is but a man, the\r\nson of man, who came from Nazareth; we know his mother, and his other\r\nkin.\r\n\r\n19  And Jesus knew their thoughts; he said to them, Why murmur you, and\r\nreason thus among yourselves?\r\n\r\n20  The Christ is everlasting life; he came from heaven; he has the\r\nkeys of heaven, and no man enters into heaven except he fills himself\r\nwith Christ.\r\n\r\n21  I came in flesh to do the will of God, and, lo, this flesh and\r\nblood are filled with Christ; and so I am the living bread that comes\r\nfrom heaven;\r\n\r\n22  And when you eat this flesh and drink this blood you will have\r\neverlasting life; and if you will, you may become the bread of life.\r\n\r\n23  And many of the people were enraged; they said, How can this man\r\ngive us his flesh to eat, his blood to drink?\r\n\r\n24  And his disciples were aggrieved because he said these things, and\r\nmany turned away and followed him no more.\r\n\r\n25  They said, This is a fearful thing for him to say, If you eat not\r\nmy flesh and drink my blood, you cannot enter into life.\r\n\r\n26  They could not comprehend the parable he spoke.\r\n\r\n27  And Jesus said, You stumble and you fall before the truth; What\r\nwill you do when you shall see this flesh and blood transmuted into\r\nhigher form?\r\n\r\n28  What will you say when you shall see the son of man ascending on\r\nthe clouds of heaven?\r\n\r\n29  What will you say when you shall see the son of man sit on the\r\nthrone of God?\r\n\r\n30  The flesh is naught; the spirit is the quickening power. The words\r\nI speak are spirit; they are life.\r\n\r\n31  When Jesus saw the many who had been so loud in their professions\r\nof their faith in him, turn back and go away, he said unto the twelve,\r\n\r\n32  Will you desert me in this hour and go away?\r\n\r\n33  But Peter said, Lord, we have no place else to go; you have the\r\nwords of everlasting life; we know that you are sent to us from God.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 126.\r\n\r\n    _Scribes and Pharisees visit Jesus. They censure him for eating\r\n      with unwashed hands. He defends his acts and teaches a lesson\r\n      on hypocrisy. Privately explains to the twelve his public\r\n      teachings._\r\n\r\nA company of scribes and Pharisees came from Jerusalem to learn\r\nwherein the power of Jesus lay.\r\n\r\n2  But when they learned that he and his disciples heeded not the\r\ncustom of the Jews, regarding washing of the hands before they ate,\r\nthey were amazed.\r\n\r\n3  And Jesus said, Hypocrisy is queen among you scribes and Pharisees.\r\nOf you Isaiah wrote:\r\n\r\n4  This people honor me with lips; their hearts are far away. In vain\r\nthey worship me; their doctrines are the dogmas and the creeds of men.\r\n\r\n5  You men who pose as men of God, and still reject the laws of God and\r\nteach the laws of men,\r\n\r\n6  Stand forth and tell when God gave unto men the ceremonial laws that\r\nyou observe; and tell these people how the spirit life is sullied if\r\none washes not before he eats.\r\n\r\n7  His critics answered not, and then he said,\r\n\r\n8  Hear me, you men of Israel! Defilement is a creature of the heart.\r\nThe carnal mind lays hold of thought, and makes a monstrous bride;\r\nthis bride is sin; sin is a creature of the mind.\r\n\r\n9  That which defiles a man is not the food he eats.\r\n\r\n10  The bread and fish and other things we eat, are simply cups to\r\ncarry to the cells of flesh material for the building of the human\r\nhouse, and when their work is done as refuse they are cast away.\r\n\r\n11  The life of plant and flesh that goes to build the human house is\r\nnever food for soul. The spirit does not feed upon the carcasses of\r\nanimal, or plant.\r\n\r\n12  God feeds the soul direct from heaven; the bread of life comes from\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n13  The air we breathe is charged with Holy Breath, and he who wills\r\nmay take this Holy Breath.\r\n\r\n14  The soul discriminates, and he who wants the life of Christ may\r\nbreathe it in. According to your faith so let it be.\r\n\r\n15  Man is not a part of his abiding place; the house is not the man.\r\n\r\n16  The lower world builds up the house of flesh, and keeps it in\r\nrepair; the higher world provides the bread of spirit life.\r\n\r\n17  The loveliest lilies grow from stagnant ponds and filthiest muck.\r\n\r\n18  The law of flesh demands that one should keep the body clean.\r\n\r\n19  The law of spirit calls for purity in thought and word and deed.\r\n\r\n20  Now, when the evening came and they were in the house, the twelve\r\nhad many things to say, and many questions to propound.\r\n\r\n21  Nathaniel asked, Was what you said about the house of flesh a\r\nparable? If so, what does it mean?\r\n\r\n22  And Jesus said, Can you not yet discriminate? Do you not yet\r\nperceive that what a man takes in his mouth defiles him not?\r\n\r\n23  His food goes not into his soul; it is material for flesh and bone\r\nand brawn.\r\n\r\n24  To spirit everything is clean.\r\n\r\n25  That which defiles a man wells up from carnal thoughts; and carnal\r\nthoughts spring from the heart, and generate a host of evil things.\r\n\r\n26  From out the heart comes murders, thefts and foolishness. All\r\nselfish acts and sensual deeds spring from the heart.\r\n\r\n27  To eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man.\r\n\r\n28  And Peter said, Lord, What you said today has grievously offended\r\nscribe and Pharisee.\r\n\r\n29  And Jesus said, These scribes and Pharisees are not the scions of\r\nthe tree of life; they are not plants of God; they are the plants of\r\nmen, and every foreign plant shall be plucked up.\r\n\r\n30  Let all these men alone; they are blind guides; they lead a\r\nmultitude of people who are blind.\r\n\r\n31  The leaders and the led together walk; together they will fall into\r\nthe yawning pits.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 127.\r\n\r\n    _The Christines cross the sea to Decapolis.

They\r\n      remain three days, then go into a village by the sea._\r\n\r\nNow, Jesus took the twelve and with them crossed the sea at night and\r\ncame unto the borders of Decapolis,\r\n\r\n2  That he might find a secret place where, all alone, he could reveal\r\nto them the things to come.\r\n\r\n3  They went into a mountain pass and spent three days in prayer.\r\n\r\n4  Then Jesus said, Behold, the time is near when I will walk with you\r\nin flesh no more.\r\n\r\n5  Lo, I have taught that he who counts his life of so much worth that\r\nhe would give it not in willing sacrifice to save his brother man, is\r\nworthy not to enter into life.\r\n\r\n6  Lo, I am come as pattern for the sons of men, and I have not\r\nrefrained from helpfulness.\r\n\r\n7  When I had passed the seven tests in Heliopolis, I consecrated life\r\nand all I had, to save the world.\r\n\r\n8  In the Judean wilderness I fought the strongest foes of men, and\r\nthere I reaffirmed my consecration to the service of my fellow man.\r\n\r\n9  In troubles and in trials I have wavered not; when false accusers\r\ncame, I answered not.\r\n\r\n10  God gave the saving Word to me, and I have often spoken it and\r\nhealed the sick, drove unclean spirits out, and raised the dead.\r\n\r\n11  And I have shown you how to speak the Word; and I have given you\r\nthe Word;\r\n\r\n12  In just a little while we turn our faces toward Jerusalem, and one\r\nof you who hear me now will then betray me into wicked hands.\r\n\r\n13  The scribes and Pharisees will bring false charges up and hale me\r\ninto court, and, by consent of Rome, I will be crucified.\r\n\r\n14  Then Peter said, My Lord, it shall not be. The Roman soldiers will\r\ntread on twelve dead men before they reach our Lord.\r\n\r\n15  But Jesus said, A savior of the world cannot resist.\r\n\r\n16  I came to save the world and I have taken up your names before the\r\nhighest courts of heaven, and you have been confirmed as saviors of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n17  And not a name, excepting that of him who shall betray, will ever\r\nbe disgraced.\r\n\r\n18  I go my way, and though my flesh shall pass, my soul will stand\r\nbeside you all the way to guide and bless.\r\n\r\n19  And wicked men will seize you in the streets, and as you kneel in\r\nprayer; will charge you with some legal crime, and think they serve\r\ntheir God by putting you to death.\r\n\r\n20  But falter not; the load will heavy be, but with the consciousness\r\nof duty done, the peace of God will lift the load, dispel the pain and\r\nlight the way.\r\n\r\n21  And we will meet where carnal executioners come not; there we will\r\nserve the cruel men, who in their ignorance had tortured us to death.\r\n\r\n22  Can we prevent this outrage and this slaughter of our lives? If not\r\nwe are but creatures of the ebb and flow of carnal things. It would\r\nnot be a sacrifice of life.\r\n\r\n23  But we are masters of the things of time. Lo, we can speak, and\r\nall the spirits of the fire, water, earth and air will stand in our\r\ndefense.\r\n\r\n24  We can command and many legions of the angel world would come and\r\nstrike our enemies to earth.\r\n\r\n25  But it is best that not a power of heaven or earth should come to\r\nour relief. And it is best that even God should veil his face and seem\r\nto hear us not.\r\n\r\n26  As I am pattern unto you, so you are patterns for the human race.\r\nWe show by non-resistance that we give our lives in willing sacrifice\r\nfor man.\r\n\r\n27  But my example will not end with death. My body will be laid within\r\na tomb in which no flesh has lain, symbolic of the purity of life in\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n28  And in the tomb I will remain three days in sweet communion with\r\nthe Christ, and with my Father-God, and Mother-God.\r\n\r\n29  And then, symbolic of the ascent of the soul to higher life, my\r\nflesh within the tomb will disappear;\r\n\r\n30  Will be transmuted into higher form, and, in the presence of you\r\nall, I will ascend to God.\r\n\r\n31  Then Jesus and the twelve went to a village by the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 128.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus goes at night to a mountain to pray. His disciples\r\n      and the villagers find him and he teaches them for three\r\n      days. Feeds four thousand people. The Christines go to\r\n      Cæsarea-Philippi. They consider the personality of Christ.\r\n      Peter is chosen as apostolic leader._\r\n\r\nNow, in the night while the disciples slept, lo, Jesus rose and went\r\nalone into a mountain pass, six miles away, to pray.\r\n\r\n2  And in the morning when the twelve awoke they could not find the\r\nLord, and all the people of the village sought, and when the sun had\r\npassed its highest point they found him in the mountain pass.\r\n\r\n3  And multitudes of people came and brought their sick, and Jesus\r\ntaught and healed.\r\n\r\n4  And when the night came on the people would not go; they slept upon\r\nthe ground that they might be a-near the Lord.\r\n\r\n5  Three days and nights the multitudes remained, and none had aught to\r\neat.\r\n\r\n6  And Jesus had compassion and he said, If I should send the\r\nmultitudes away they might not reach their homes, for they are faint,\r\nfor some have journeyed many miles.\r\n\r\n7  And his disciples said, Where shall we get enough of food to feed\r\nthem all? There are four thousand men, besides the women and the\r\nlittle ones.\r\n\r\n8  And Jesus said, How many loaves have you?\r\n\r\n9  They answered, Seven, and some little fish.\r\n\r\n10  And Jesus said, Go to, and seat the people as you seated them the\r\nother day when all the multitudes were fed, in companies of twelve.\r\n\r\n11  And when the people were sat down in companies of twelve the loaves\r\nand fish were brought.\r\n\r\n12  And Jesus looked to heaven and spoke the Word; and then he broke\r\nthe seven loaves in little bits, and likewise cut the fish.\r\n\r\n13  And every bit of bread became a loaf, and every piece of fish\r\nbecame a fish.\r\n\r\n14  The twelve went forth and gave to every one; the people ate and\r\nthey were filled; and all the fragments that were left were gathered\r\nup, and there were seven baskets full.\r\n\r\n15  And then the people went their ways, and Jesus and the twelve took\r\nboats and came to Dalmanatha by the sea.\r\n\r\n16  Here they remained for many days, and Jesus told the twelve about\r\nthe inner light that cannot fail;\r\n\r\n17  About the kingdom of the Christ within the soul; about the power\r\nof faith; about the secret of the resurrection of the dead; about\r\nimmortal life, and how the living may go forth and help the dead.\r\n\r\n18  And then they went into their boats, and came unto the northern\r\ncoast of Galilee, and in Chorazin where the kin of Thomas lived, they\r\nleft their boats and journeyed on.\r\n\r\n19  They came to Merom, where the crystal waters seem to catch the\r\nimages of heaven and to reflect the glory of the Lord of hosts.\r\n\r\n20  And here they tarried certain days in silent thought.\r\n\r\n21  And then they journeyed on, and came into the land of\r\nCæsarea-Philippi.\r\n\r\n22  And as they walked and talked among themselves, the master said,\r\nWhat do the people say about the son of man? who do they think I am?\r\n\r\n23  And Matthew said, Some say that you are David come again; some say\r\nthat you are Enoch, Solomon, or Seth.\r\n\r\n24  And Andrew said, I heard a ruler of the synagogue exclaim, This man\r\nis Jeremiah, for he speaks like Jeremiah wrote.\r\n\r\n25  Nathaniel said, The foreign masters who were with us for a time,\r\ndeclared that Jesus is Gautama come again.\r\n\r\n26  James said, I think that most the master Jews believe you are the\r\nreappearence of Elijah on the earth.\r\n\r\n27  And John spoke out and said, When we were in Jerusalem I heard a\r\nseer exclaim, This Jesus is none other than Melchizedek, the king of\r\npeace, who lived about two thousand years ago, and said that he would\r\ncome again.\r\n\r\n28  And Thomas said, The Tetrarch Herod thinks that you are John arisen\r\nfrom the dead;\r\n\r\n29  But then his conscience troubles him; the spirit of the murdered\r\nJohn looms up before him in his dreams, and haunts him as a specter of\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\n30  And Jesus asked, Who do you think I am?\r\n\r\n31  And Peter said, You are the Christ, the love of God made manifest\r\nto men.\r\n\r\n32  And Jesus said, Thrice blessed are you, Simon, Jonas’ son. You have\r\ndeclared a truth that God has given you.\r\n\r\n33  You are a rock, and you shall be a pillar in the temple of the Lord\r\nof hosts.\r\n\r\n34  And your confession is the cornerstone of faith, a rock of\r\nstrength, and on this rock the Church of Christ is built.\r\n\r\n35  Against it all the powers of hades and of death cannot prevail.\r\n\r\n36  Behold, I give to you the keys to open up the doors of safety for\r\nthe sons of men.\r\n\r\n37  The Holy Breath will come upon you and the ten, and in Jerusalem\r\nyou shall stand before the nations of the earth, and there proclaim\r\nthe covenant of God with men.\r\n\r\n38  And you shall speak the words of Holy Breath, and whatsoever God\r\nrequires of men as earnest of their faith in Christ, you shall make\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n39  Then turning to the twelve he said, What you have heard this day\r\ntell not to any man.\r\n\r\n40  Then Jesus and the twelve went up and were Susanna’s guests for\r\nmany days.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 129.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus teaches the people. He takes Peter, James and John and\r\n      goes to a high mountain and is transfigured before them._\r\n\r\nThe news soon spread that Jesus and the twelve were come, and many\r\npeople came to see.\r\n\r\n2  And Jesus said, Behold, you come to see, but that means naught. If\r\nyou would have the benedictions of the Christ, take up your cross and\r\nfollow me.\r\n\r\n3  If you would give your life for selfish self, then you will lose\r\nyour life.\r\n\r\n4  If you will give your life in service of your fellow men, then you\r\nwill save your life.\r\n\r\n5  This life is but a span, a bauble of today. There is a life that\r\npasses not.\r\n\r\n6  Where is your profit if you gain the world and lose your soul? What\r\nwould you take in payment for your soul?\r\n\r\n7  If you would find the spirit life, the life of man in God, then you\r\nmust walk a narrow way and enter through a narrow gate.\r\n\r\n8  The way is Christ, the gate is Christ, and you must come up by the\r\nway of Christ. No man comes unto God but by the Christ.\r\n\r\n9  The kingdom of the Christ will come; yea, some of you who hear me\r\nnow will not pass through the gates of death until you see the kingdom\r\ncome in power.\r\n\r\n10  For seven days the master and the twelve remained in\r\nCæsarea-Philippi.\r\n\r\n11  Then Jesus, taking Peter, James and John, went forth unto a\r\nmountain top to pray.\r\n\r\n12  And as he prayed a brilliant light appeared; his form became as\r\nradiant as a precious stone;\r\n\r\n13  His face shone like the sun; his garments seemed as white as snow;\r\nthe son of man became the son of God.\r\n\r\n14  He was transfigured that the men of earth might see the\r\npossibilities of man.\r\n\r\n15  When first the glory came the three disciples were asleep; a master\r\ntouched their eyes and said, Awake and see the glory of the Lord.\r\n\r\n16  And they awoke, and saw the glory of the Lord; and more, they saw\r\nthe glory of the heavenly world, for they beheld two men from thence\r\nstand forth beside the Lord.\r\n\r\n17  And Peter asked the master who awakened them, Who are these men who\r\nstand beside the Lord?\r\n\r\n18  The master said, These men are Moses and Elijah, who are come that\r\nyou may know that heaven and earth are one; that masters there and\r\nmasters here are one.\r\n\r\n19  The veil that separates the worlds is but an ether veil. For those\r\nwho purify their hearts by faith the veil is rolled aside, and they\r\ncan see and know that death is an illusive thing.\r\n\r\n20  And Peter said, Praise God! And then he called to Jesus and he\r\nsaid, My master and my Lord, this is the gate of heaven, and it is\r\nwell that we remain.\r\n\r\n21  May we go down and bring three tents; a tent for you, a tent for\r\nMoses, and for Elijah one? But Jesus answered not.\r\n\r\n22  And Moses and Elijah talked with Jesus on the mount. They talked\r\nabout the coming trial of the Lord;\r\n\r\n23  About his death, his rest within the tomb; about the wonders of the\r\nresurrection morn; the transmutation of his flesh, and his ascension\r\non the clouds of light;\r\n\r\n24  And all symbolic of the path that every man must tread; symbolic of\r\nthe way the sons of men become the sons of God.\r\n\r\n25  The three disciples were amazed, and suddenly the ethers were\r\nsurcharged with song, and forms as light as air, moved all about the\r\nmountain top.\r\n\r\n26  And then from out the glory of the upper world they heard a voice\r\nthat said,\r\n\r\n27  This is the son of man, my chosen one to manifest the Christ to\r\nmen. Let all the earth hear him.\r\n\r\n28  When the disciples heard the voice they were afraid; they fell upon\r\nthe ground and prayed.\r\n\r\n29  And Jesus came; he touched them and he said, Arise, fear not; lo, I\r\nam here.\r\n\r\n30  Then they arose, and as they looked about they saw no one; the men\r\nhad gone. The master only stood with them.\r\n\r\n31  As Jesus and the three came from the mountain top they talked about\r\nthe meaning of the scene, and Jesus told them all; and then he said,\r\n\r\n32  Till I have risen from the dead tell not to any one what you have\r\nseen.\r\n\r\n33  But the disciples could not comprehend the meaning of the words,\r\nTill I have risen from the dead.\r\n\r\n34  And Jesus told them once again about his death, and rising from the\r\ngrave; about the kingdom of the soul that was to come in glory and in\r\npower.\r\n\r\n35  But Peter said, The scribes have taught that e’er the king shall\r\ncome Elijah must appear.\r\n\r\n36  And Jesus said, Elijah has already come; but scribes and Pharisees\r\nreceived him not;\r\n\r\n37  And men reviled him, bound him, cast him in a prison cell, and\r\nshouted with a fiend’s delight to see him die.\r\n\r\n38  What men have done to him, that they will do to me.\r\n\r\n39  Then the disciples understood that Jesus spoke of John whom Herod\r\nslew.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 130.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus and the three disciples return to Cæsarea-Philippi. The\r\n      nine had failed to cure an epileptic child. Jesus heals it\r\n      and rebukes his disciples for their lack of trust in God. The\r\n      Christines return to Capernaum._\r\n\r\nWhen Jesus, Peter, James and John were come unto the city’s gates a\r\nmultitude of people thronged the way.\r\n\r\n2  The nine apostles who went not with Jesus to the mount, had tried\r\nto heal an epileptic child who was obsessed, and they had failed; the\r\npeople waited for the coming of the Lord.\r\n\r\n3  When Jesus came the father of the child knelt down before him and\r\nimplored his help.\r\n\r\n4  He said, My master, I beseech that you will look in pity on my son,\r\nmy only child; he is an epileptic child and suffers grievously.\r\n\r\n5  Sometimes he falls into the fire and is burned; again he falls into\r\nthe water and is like to drown; and many times a day he falls, he\r\ngrinds his teeth, the foam pours from his mouth.\r\n\r\n6  I took my child to your disciples, and they failed to give relief.\r\n\r\n7  And as he spoke a servant brought the child before the Lord (the\r\nchild spoke not, for he was dumb), and instantly he fell upon the\r\nground, he foamed, he writhed in agony.\r\n\r\n8  And Jesus said, How long has he been troubled thus?\r\n\r\n9  The father said, From infancy; and we have sought in many lands for\r\nhelp, but found it not; but I believe that you can speak the Word and\r\nheal my son.\r\n\r\n10  And Jesus said, Faith is the power of God. All things are possible\r\nfor him who in his heart believes.\r\n\r\n11  The father cried, in tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine\r\nunbelief.\r\n\r\n12  And Jesus spoke the Word of power; the epileptic child lay in a\r\nswoon; he did not breathe, and all the people said, The child is dead.\r\n\r\n13  But Jesus took him by the hand and said: Arise; and he arose and\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n14  The people were amazed, and many said, This surely is a man of God,\r\nfor no such power was ever given to man.\r\n\r\n15  Then Jesus and the twelve went to the house, and after they had\r\ntaken food and been refreshed, the nine disciples said,\r\n\r\n16  Lord, why could we not heal this child? We spoke the Word; but even\r\nthat was powerless.\r\n\r\n17  And Jesus said, Your great success in all your former work has made\r\nyou careless, and you forgot to recognize the power of God.\r\n\r\n18  Without the spirit of the Word, the Word is like an idle tale; and\r\nyou forgot to pray.\r\n\r\n19  There is no faith without the prayer of faith. Faith is the wings\r\nof prayer; but wings alone fly not.\r\n\r\n20  By prayer and faith you can bring down the mountain peaks, and cast\r\nthem in the sea; the little hills will skip about like lambs at your\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\n21  This failure may be well for you. The greatest lessons that are\r\nlearned in life come through the failures that are made.\r\n\r\n22  As the disciples sat in thoughtful meditation Jesus said, Let these\r\nwords sink into your hearts:\r\n\r\n23  The time has nearly come when you must bear your load alone; that\r\nis, without my presence in the flesh.\r\n\r\n24  For I will fall into the hands of wicked men, and they will slay me\r\non a mount beyond Bezetha wall.\r\n\r\n25  And men will lay my body in a tomb where, by the sacred Word, it\r\nwill be guarded and preserved three days; then I will rise again.\r\n\r\n26  The twelve were sad; they did not understand, and yet they feared\r\nto ask him to reveal the meaning of his word.\r\n\r\n27  Next day the Christine master and the twelve began their journey of\r\nreturn, and soon were in Capernaum.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 131.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus and Peter pay the half-shekel tax. The disciples contend\r\n      for the supremacy. Jesus rebukes them. Teaches them many\r\n      practical lessons. The parable of the good shepherd._\r\n\r\nAs Jesus and the twelve were resting in the house, the tax collector\r\ncame to Peter saying, Man, do Jesus and yourself pay this half-shekel\r\ntax?\r\n\r\n2  And Peter said, We pay whatever is assessed.\r\n\r\n3  And Jesus said, From whom do publicans collect this special tax?\r\nfrom strangers or from native sons?\r\n\r\n4  And Peter said, The strangers only are supposed to pay this tax.\r\n\r\n5  Then Jesus said, We all are native sons and we are free; but lest\r\nwe cause contention we will pay the tax; but neither had the shekel\r\nwherewithal to pay.\r\n\r\n6  And Jesus said, Go to the sea; cast in a hook and catch a fish and\r\nyou will find within its inner parts a shekel, which take up and pay\r\nthe tax for you and me.\r\n\r\n7  And Peter did as Jesus said; he found the shekel and he paid the tax.\r\n\r\n8  Now Jesus heard the twelve dispute among themselves. The spirit of\r\nthe carnal self was moving in their hearts, and they were questioning\r\namong themselves who was the greatest in the sight of God and man.\r\n\r\n9  And Jesus said, You men, for shame! the greatest is the servant of\r\nthe rest. And then he called to him a little child; he took it in his\r\narms and said,\r\n\r\n10  The greatest is the little child, and if you would be great at all\r\nyou must become as is this child in innocence, in truth, in purity in\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n11  Great men scorn not the little things of earth; he who regards and\r\nhonors such a child, regards and honors me, and he who scorns a child,\r\nscorn me.\r\n\r\n12  If you would enter through the kingdom gate you must be humble as\r\nthis little child.\r\n\r\n13  Hear me, you men, This child, as every other child, has one to\r\nplead its cause before the throne of God.\r\n\r\n14  You scorn it at your peril, men, for lo, I say, its counterpart\r\nbeholds the face of God at every moment, every day.\r\n\r\n15  And hear me once again, He who shall cause a little one to stumble\r\nand to fall is marked, accursed; and it were better far if he had\r\ndrowned himself.\r\n\r\n16  Behold, offenses everywhere! Men find occasions for to sin and\r\nfall, and they grow strong by rising when they fall;\r\n\r\n17  But woe to him who causes other men to stumble and to fall.\r\n\r\n18  Be on your guard, you men of God, lest you constrain another man to\r\nfall; beware lest you fall into sinful ways yourselves.\r\n\r\n19  Now, if your hands cause you to sin, you better cut them off; for\r\nit is better far to have no hands and not be guilty in the sight of\r\nGod and men, than to be perfect in your form and lose your soul.\r\n\r\n20  And if your feet should cause offense, you better cut them off;\r\nfor it is better far to enter into life without your feet than fall\r\nbeneath the curse.\r\n\r\n21  And if your eyes, or ears, cause you to sin, you better lose them\r\nall than lose your soul.\r\n\r\n22  Your thoughts and words and deeds will all be tried by fire.\r\n\r\n23  Remember that you are the salt of earth; but if you lose the\r\nvirtues of the salt, you are but refuse in the sight of God.\r\n\r\n24  Retain the virtues of the salt of life and be at peace among\r\nyourselves.\r\n\r\n25  The world is full of men who have not in themselves the salt of\r\nlife, and they are lost. I come to seek and save the lost.\r\n\r\n26  How think you? if a shepherd has a hundred sheep, and one of them\r\nhas gone astray, will he not leave the ninety and the nine,\r\n\r\n27  And go out in the desert ways and mountain tops to seek the one\r\nthat went astray?\r\n\r\n28  Yes, this you know; and if he finds the one that went astray, lo,\r\nhe is glad, and he rejoices over it far more than over all the ninety\r\nand the nine that did not go astray.\r\n\r\n29  And so there is rejoicing in the courts of heaven when one of human\r\nbirth who has gone forth into the ways of sin is found and brought\r\nback to the fold;\r\n\r\n30  Yea, there is joy, more joy than over all the righteous men who\r\nnever went astray.\r\n\r\n31  And John said, Master, who may seek and save the lost? and who may\r\nheal the sick, and cast the demons out of those obsessed?\r\n\r\n32  When we were on the way we saw a man who was not one of us, cast\r\ndemons out and heal the sick.\r\n\r\n33  He did it by the sacred Word and in the name of Christ; but we\r\nforbade him, for he did not walk with us.\r\n\r\n34  And Jesus said, You sons of men, do you imagine that you own the\r\npowers of God?\r\n\r\n35  And do you think that all the world must wait for you to do the\r\nworks of God?\r\n\r\n36  God is not man that he should have a special care for any man, and\r\ngive him special gifts.\r\n\r\n37  Forbid not any man to do the works of God.\r\n\r\n38  There is no man who can pronounce the sacred Word, and in the name\r\nof Christ restore the sick, and cast the unclean spirits out, who is\r\nnot child of God.\r\n\r\n39  The man of whom you speak is one with us. Whoever gathers in the\r\ngrain of heaven is one with us.\r\n\r\n40  Whoever gives a cup of water in the name of Christ is one with us;\r\nso God shall judge.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 132.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus defends a man who has been convicted of stealing bread.\r\n      The verdict is reversed. The man goes free, and the people\r\n      supply the needs of his starving family._\r\n\r\nA multitude of people thronged the streets. The officers were on the\r\nway to court with one, a man accused of stealing bread.\r\n\r\n2  And in a little while the man was brought before the judge to answer\r\nto the charge.\r\n\r\n3  And Jesus and the twelve were there. The man showed in his face and\r\nhands the hard drawn lines of toil and want.\r\n\r\n4  A woman richly clad, the accuser of the man, stood forth and said, I\r\ncaught this man myself; I know him well, for yesterday he came to beg\r\nfor bread,\r\n\r\n5  And when I drove him from my door, he should have known that I would\r\nharbor not a man like him; and then today he came and took the bread.\r\n\r\n6  He is a thief and I demand that he be sent to jail.\r\n\r\n7  The servants also testified against the man; he was adjudged a\r\nthief, and officers were leading him away.\r\n\r\n8  But Jesus standing forth exclaimed, You officers and judge, be not\r\nin haste to lead this man away.\r\n\r\n9  Is this a land of justice and of right? can you accuse and sentence\r\nmen to punishment for any crime until they testify themselves?\r\n\r\n10  The Roman law will not permit such travesty on right, and I demand\r\nthat you permit this man to speak.\r\n\r\n11  And then the judge recalled the man and said, If you have any tale\r\nto tell, say on.\r\n\r\n12  In tears the man stood forth and said, I have a wife and little\r\nones and they are perishing for bread, and I have told my story oft,\r\nand begged for bread; but none would hear.\r\n\r\n13  This morning when I left our cheerless hut in search of work my\r\nchildren cried for bread, and I resolved to feed them or to die.\r\n\r\n14  I took the bread, and I appeal to God, Was it a crime?\r\n\r\n15  This woman snatched the loaf away and threw it to the dogs, and\r\ncalled the officers and I am here.\r\n\r\n16  Good people, do with me whate’er you will, but save my wife and\r\nlittle ones from death.\r\n\r\n17  Then Jesus said, Who is the culprit in this case?\r\n\r\n18  I charge this woman as a felon in the sight of God.\r\n\r\n19  I charge this judge as criminal before the bar of human rights.\r\n\r\n20  I charge these servants and these officers as parties to the crime.\r\n\r\n21  I charge the people of Capernaum with cruelty and theft, because\r\nthey heeded not the cries of poverty and want, and have withheld from\r\nhelpless ones that which is theirs by every law of right;\r\n\r\n22  And I appeal unto these people here, and ask, Are not my charges\r\nbased on righteousness and truth?\r\n\r\n23  And every man said, Yes.\r\n\r\n24  The accusing woman blushed for shame; the judge shrank back in\r\nfear; the officers threw off the shackles from the man and ran away.\r\n\r\n25  Then Jesus said, Give this man what he needs and let him go and\r\nfeed his wife and little ones.\r\n\r\n26  The people gave abundantly; the man went on his way.\r\n\r\n27  And Jesus said, There is no standard law to judge of crime. The\r\nfacts must all be stated e’er a judgment can be rendered in a case.\r\n\r\n28  You men with hearts; go forth and stand where stood this man and\r\nanswer me, What would you do?\r\n\r\n29  The thief thinks every other man a thief and judges him accordingly.\r\n\r\n30  The man who judges harshly is the man whose heart is full of crime.\r\n\r\n31  The courtesan who keeps her wickedness concealed by what she calls\r\nrespectability, has not a word of pity for the honest courtesan who\r\nclaims to be just what she is.\r\n\r\n32  I tell you, men, if you would censure not till you are free from\r\nsin, the world would soon forget the meaning of the word, accused.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 133.\r\n\r\n    _The twelve go to the feast in Jerusalem, but Jesus remains in\r\n      Capernaum. He selects seventy disciples, and sends them out\r\n      to teach and heal. He goes alone to the feast and on his way\r\n      he heals ten lepers. He teaches in the temple._\r\n\r\nThe harvest feast drew near; the twelve went to Jerusalem, but Jesus\r\ndid not go with them; he tarried in Capernaum.\r\n\r\n2  Among the multitudes that followed him were many who went not up to\r\nthe feast; they were not Jews.\r\n\r\n3  And Jesus called three-score-and-ten of these disciples unto him and\r\nsaid, The kingdom of the Christ is not for Jews alone; it is for every\r\nman.\r\n\r\n4  Lo, I have chosen twelve to preach the gospel, first unto the Jews;\r\nand they are Jews.\r\n\r\n5  Twelve is the number of the Jew and seven the number of the all,\r\nincluding every man.\r\n\r\n6  God is the ten, the holy Jod.\r\n\r\n7  When God and man are multiplied we have three-score-and-ten, the\r\nnumber of the brotherhood of man.\r\n\r\n8  And now I send you forth by twos and twos; not to the Jews alone,\r\nbut unto every nation under heaven; to Greek and to Assyrian; to the\r\nSamaritan; to those beyond the seas; to every man.\r\n\r\n9  You need not go afar, for men of every land are here and in Samaria.\r\n\r\n10  Arise and go your way; but go in faith; and take no gold nor silver\r\nin your purse; no extra coat or shoes.\r\n\r\n11  Go in the sacred name; trust God and you will never come to want.\r\n\r\n12  And let this be your salutation everywhere, Peace be to all; good\r\nwill to all.\r\n\r\n13  And if the son of peace be in the house, the door will open wide\r\nand you will enter in; and then the holy peace will rest upon that\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n14  The seventy in twos went forth; they went into Samaria, and as they\r\nwent they said, Peace be to all; good will to all!\r\n\r\n15  Repent and turn from sin, and set your house in order, for a son of\r\nman who bears the image of the Christ, will come, and you may see his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n16  They entered every village of Samaria; they preached in Tyre and\r\nin Sidon by the sea. Some went to Crete, and others into Greece, and\r\nothers went to Gilead and taught.\r\n\r\n17  And Jesus, all alone, went to the feast by the Samaria way; and as\r\nhe went through Sychar on the way, the lepers saw him and a company of\r\nten called from afar and said,\r\n\r\n18  Lord Jesus, stay and speak the Word for us that we may be made\r\nclean.\r\n\r\n19  And Jesus said, Go forth and show yourselves unto the priests.\r\n\r\n20  They went, and as they went their leprosy was healed. One of the\r\nten, a native of Samaria, returned to thank the master and to praise\r\nthe Lord.\r\n\r\n21  And Jesus said to him, Lo, ten were cleansed; where are the nine?\r\nArise, and go your way; your faith has made you whole.\r\n\r\n22  You have revealed your heart and shown that you are worthy of the\r\npower; behold the nine will find again their leprous hands and feet.\r\n\r\n23  And Jesus went his way, and while the feast was on he came into\r\nJerusalem, and went into the temple courts.\r\n\r\n24  And he rebuked the scribes and Pharisees, the priests and doctors\r\nof the law for their hypocrisy and selfishness.\r\n\r\n25  The common people were amazed; they said, From whence has come the\r\nwisdom of this man? he speaks as speaks a sage.\r\n\r\n26  And Jesus said, I did not learn the wisdom of the Holy One within\r\nthe schools of men; my teaching is not mine; I speak the words of him\r\nwho sent me here to do his will.\r\n\r\n27  If any man would know whereof I speak, lo, he must do the will of\r\nGod. No man can know except he enters into life and does the will of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n28  Now, Moses gave the law; but none of you have kept the law; how can\r\nyou judge the worthiness of any man?\r\n\r\n29  Once in these courts I healed a man upon a Sabbath day, and in a\r\nrage you sought to take my life; and now because I tell the truth you\r\nseek again to take my life.\r\n\r\n30  A scribe spoke out and said, You foolish man, you are obsessed; who\r\nwants to take your life?\r\n\r\n31  The common people said, Is this not Jesus whom the rulers long have\r\nsought to kill? and now he comes and teaches in the temple courts.\r\n\r\n32  If he is guilty of such monstrous crimes, why do they not take him\r\naway in chains?\r\n\r\n33  And Jesus said, You all know me, and know from whence I came; but\r\nyou know not the God who sent me here, whose words I speak.\r\n\r\n34  The multitudes again stood forth in his defense; they said, If this\r\nis not the Christ whom God has promised to reveal to men, will he do\r\ngreater works when he shall come than does this man?\r\n\r\n35  The Pharisees and ruling priests were angered and they sent their\r\nofficers to take him e’er he went away. The officers were filled with\r\nfear; they seized him not.\r\n\r\n36  And Jesus said, Lo, I am here but for a little time and then I go\r\nmy way to him who sent me here to do his will.\r\n\r\n37  You seek me now and you can find me now; the time will come when\r\nyou will seek and will not find, for where I go you cannot come.\r\n\r\n38  The people said, Where will he go that men can find him not? Will\r\nhe go forth to Greece and teach the Greeks? or will he go to Egypt or\r\nAssyria to teach?\r\n\r\n39  But Jesus answered not; unnoticed by the multitudes he left the\r\ntemple courts and went his way.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 134.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus teaches in the temple. His words enrage the rulers.\r\n      Nicodemus defends him. He spends the night in prayer on Mount\r\n      Olives. Next day he again teaches in the temple. An adultress\r\n      is brought before him for judgment._\r\n\r\nNow, on the last day of the feast when multitudes were in the\r\ncourtways, Jesus said,\r\n\r\n2  Whoever is athirst may come to me and drink.\r\n\r\n3  He who believes in me and in the Christ whom God has sent, may drink\r\nthe cup of life, and from his inner parts shall streams of living\r\nwaters flow.\r\n\r\n4  The Holy Breath will overshadow him, and he will breathe the Breath,\r\nand speak the words, and live the life.\r\n\r\n5  The people were divided in their views concerning him. Some said,\r\nThis man is prophet of the living God.\r\n\r\n6  And others said, He is Messiah whom our prophets said would come.\r\n\r\n7  And others said, He cannot be the Christ, for he came down from\r\nGalilee; the Christ must come from Bethlehem where David lived.\r\n\r\n8  Again the priests and Pharisees sent officers to bring him into\r\ncourt to answer for his life; but when the officers returned and\r\nbrought him not,\r\n\r\n9  The rulers were enraged and said, Why did you not arrest this man\r\nand hale him into court?\r\n\r\n10  The officers replied, We never heard a man speak like this man\r\nspeaks.\r\n\r\n11  In rage the Pharisees stood forth and said, Have you gone mad? Have\r\nyou been led astray? Are you disciples of this man?\r\n\r\n12  Have any of the rulers, or the Pharisees believed on him? The\r\ncommon people! yes, they may believe; they are accursed; they know not\r\nanything.\r\n\r\n13  But Nicodemus came before the rulers and he said, Can Jewish judges\r\njudge a man and sentence him until they hear his plea? Let Jesus stand\r\nbefore this bar and testify himself.\r\n\r\n14  The rulers said, This Jesus is a wily man, and if we suffer him to\r\nspeak, he will rebuke us face to face, and then the multitudes will\r\nlaugh and stand in his defense.\r\n\r\n15  And then you know, as well as we, that prophets do not come from\r\nGalilee.\r\n\r\n16  The rulers felt the force of what the officers and Nicodemus said,\r\nand they said nothing more.\r\n\r\n17  And then the people went their way, each to his home; but Jesus\r\nwent unto Mount Olives where he spent the night in prayer.\r\n\r\n18  But in the morning when the sun had scarcely risen, Jesus came\r\nagain, and many people came to see him in the temple courts, and he\r\nsat down and taught the multitudes.\r\n\r\n19  The Pharisees and scribes were still alert to find a cause whereby\r\nthey might condemn him by the words he spoke.\r\n\r\n20  The officers had taken in the very act of crime, a courtesan. As\r\nJesus taught, they brought this woman in and set her in the midst and\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n21  Rabboni, this vile woman has been taken in adultery. The law of\r\nMoses says that such as she shall die, be stoned to death; what do you\r\nsay should be her punishment?\r\n\r\n22  And Jesus stooped and made a figure on the ground and in it placed\r\nthe number of a soul, and then he sat in silent thought.\r\n\r\n23  And when the priests demanded that he speak, he said, Let him who\r\nhas no sin stand forth and be the first to cast a stone at her.\r\n\r\n24  And then he closed his eyes, and not a word was said. When he arose\r\nand saw the woman all alone he said,\r\n\r\n25  Where are the men who brought you here? they who accused?\r\n\r\n26  The woman said, They all are gone; no one was here who could\r\ncondemn.\r\n\r\n27  And Jesus said, And I condemn you not; go on your way in peace, and\r\nsin no more.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 135.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus teaches in the temple. He reveals some of the deeper\r\n      meanings of the Christine ministry. The rulers are greatly\r\n      enraged and attempt to stone him, but he disappears._\r\n\r\nThe feast was done and Jesus, Peter, James and John were sitting in\r\nthe temple treasury.\r\n\r\n2  The nine had gone back to Capernaum.\r\n\r\n3  The people thronged the temple courts and Jesus said,\r\n\r\n4  I am the lamp; Christ is the oil of life; the Holy Breath the fire.\r\nBehold the light! and he who follows me shall not walk in the dark,\r\nbut he shall have the light of life.\r\n\r\n5  A lawyer said, You witness for yourself, your witness is not true.\r\n\r\n6  And Jesus said, If I do witness for myself I speak that which is\r\ntrue, for I know whence I came and where I go.\r\n\r\n7  And no one else in flesh can testify for me, for none know whence I\r\ncame, nor where I go.\r\n\r\n8  My works bear witness to the truth I speak. As man I could not speak\r\nthe words I speak; they are the words of Holy Breath; and then my\r\nFather testifies for me.\r\n\r\n9  The lawyer said, Where does your father live?\r\n\r\n10  And Jesus said, You know me not or you would know my Father, and if\r\nyou knew the Father you would know the son, because the Father and\r\nthe son are one.\r\n\r\n11  I go my way and you shall find me not; for where I go you cannot\r\ncome, because you do not know the way.\r\n\r\n12  You cannot find the way because your hearts are gross, your ears\r\nare dull, your eyes are closed.\r\n\r\n13  The light of life cannot shine through the murky veil that you have\r\ndrawn about your hearts.\r\n\r\n14  You do not know the Christ and if the Christ be not within the\r\nheart there is no light.\r\n\r\n15  I come to manifest the Christ to men and you receive me not, and\r\nyou will dwell in darkness and in the shadow of the grave till you\r\nbelieve the words I speak.\r\n\r\n16  But you will vilify the son of man, and lift him up and laugh to\r\nsee him die.\r\n\r\n17  But then a little light will come and you will know that I am what\r\nI am.\r\n\r\n18  The people did not comprehend the meaning of the words he spoke.\r\n\r\n19  And then he spoke unto the people who believed in him and said, If\r\nyou abide in Christ, and Christ abide in you, and if you keep my words\r\nwithin your heart,\r\n\r\n20  You are the way, you are disciples in the way, and you shall know\r\nwhat is the truth, and truth shall make you free.\r\n\r\n21  And still the people did not understand; they said, We are the seed\r\nof Abraham and are already free; we never were the slaves of any man;\r\nwhy do you say, We shall be free?\r\n\r\n22  And Jesus said, Do you not know that every one committing sin is\r\nslave of sin? abides in bondage unto sin?\r\n\r\n23  If you sin not then you are free; but if you sin in thought, or\r\nword, or deed, then you are slaves, and naught but truth can set you\r\nfree; if you are free through Christ, then you are free indeed.\r\n\r\n24  You are the seed of Abraham, and yet you seek to kill me just\r\nbecause I speak the truth of Abraham.\r\n\r\n25  You are the children of the flesh of Abraham; but, lo, I say, There\r\nis a spiritual Abraham whom you know not.\r\n\r\n26  In spirit you are children of your father, and your father is\r\nDiabolus; you hang upon his words and do his will.\r\n\r\n27  He was a murderer from the first; he cannot tell the truth, and\r\nwhen he tells a lie he speaks his own; he is himself a lie, and he is\r\nfather of himself.\r\n\r\n28  If you were children of my Father-God, then you could hear the\r\nwords of God; I speak the words of God, but you can hear them not.\r\n\r\n29  A Pharisee stood forth and said, This fellow is not one of us; he\r\nis a curst Samaritan and is obsessed.\r\n\r\n30  But Jesus heeded not the words of Pharisee or scribe; he knew that\r\nall the people knew he was a Jew.\r\n\r\n31  And then he said, Whoever keeps my words shall never die.\r\n\r\n32  A lawyer said, And now we know he is obsessed. Our father Abraham\r\nis dead; the prophets all are dead, and yet this fellow says, Whoever\r\nkeeps my words shall never die.\r\n\r\n33  Is this man greater than our father Abraham? Is he above the\r\nprophets? and all of them are dead.\r\n\r\n34  And Jesus said, Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; he saw\r\nit and was glad.\r\n\r\n35  The lawyer said, You simple man; you are not fifty years of age;\r\nhave you seen Abraham?\r\n\r\n36  And Jesus said, Before the days of Abraham I am.\r\n\r\n37  Again the scribes and Pharisees were in a rage; they took up stones\r\nto cast at him, but, like a phantom of the night, he disappeared; the\r\npeople knew not where he went.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 136.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus teaches in the temple. Relates the parable of the good\r\n      Samaritan. Goes to Bethany. Teaches in Lazarus’ home. Rebukes\r\n      Martha for her anxiety about the things of this life._\r\n\r\nAnd Jesus stood again within the temple courts and taught.\r\n\r\n2  A master of the law was sent to question him that he might find a\r\ncause to censure and accuse him of a crime.\r\n\r\n3  He said, Lord, tell me what to do that I may have eternal life?\r\n\r\n4  And Jesus said, You know the law; what does it say?\r\n\r\n5  The lawyer answered, You shall love the Lord your God with all your\r\nheart, with all your soul, with all your strength, with all your mind,\r\nand you shall love your neighbor as yourself.\r\n\r\n6  And Jesus said, Lo, you have answered well; this do and you shall\r\nlive.\r\n\r\n7  The lawyer said, My neighbor, who is he?\r\n\r\n8  And Jesus said, A man was going from Jerusalem to Jericho, and lo,\r\nhe met with robbers on the way, who beat him, robbed him of his goods,\r\nand left him bleeding by the way.\r\n\r\n9  A Pharisee was going down that way; he saw the wounded man; but then\r\nhe had no time to lose; he passed by on the other side.\r\n\r\n10  A Levite came and saw the man; but he was loath to soil his\r\nsacerdotal robes, and he passed by.\r\n\r\n11  A lawyer on his way to Jericho observed the dying man, and then\r\nhe said, If I could make a shekel I might help the man; but he has\r\nnothing left to give, I have no time for charity; and he passed on.\r\n\r\n12  And then a stranger from Samaria came that way; he saw the wounded\r\nman; his heart was touched with pity and he stopped, dismounted from\r\nhis horse,\r\n\r\n13  Revived the man, and placed him on his horse and took him to an inn\r\nand charged the keeper of the inn to nurse him back to strength.\r\n\r\n14  He gave the keeper all the money that he had and said, Your charges\r\nmay be more than this, but care for this unfortunate, and when I come\r\nagain I will pay all; and then he went his way.\r\n\r\n15  Now, master of the law, which of these four was neighbor unto him\r\nwho fell among the thieves?\r\n\r\n16  The lawyer said, The man who showed him mercy; he who cared for him.\r\n\r\n17  And Jesus said, Go on your way and likewise do, and you shall live.\r\n\r\n18  Now, Jesus, Peter, James and John went out to Bethany where Lazarus\r\nlived.\r\n\r\n19  And Mary sat at Jesus’ feet and heard him speak the words of life\r\nwhile Martha served.\r\n\r\n20  And Martha called, but Mary would not leave the Lord to help her\r\nserve.\r\n\r\n21  And Martha said to Jesus, Do you not care that Mary makes me bear\r\nthe burdens of the serving all the day? I beg that you will bid her\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\n22  And Jesus said, You are too anxious, Martha, for your guests; you\r\nneed not trouble so about the things of life.\r\n\r\n23  You grow a-weary by your care for little things and slight the one\r\nthing needed most of all.\r\n\r\n24  Your sister here has chosen far the better part, a part that none\r\ncan take away.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 137.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus and his disciples go into a retired place to pray. Jesus\r\n      teaches Lazarus how to pray. The model prayer. The value of\r\n      importunate prayer. Parable of the importunate housewife._\r\n\r\nNow, in the evening Jesus, Peter, James and John, with Lazarus, went\r\nout beyond the village gates to pray. And Lazarus said, Teach me to\r\npray.\r\n\r\n2  And Jesus said, The prayer I taught the twelve to pray while we were\r\nup in Galilee is one acceptable to God; and when you pray just say,\r\n\r\n3  Our Father-God who art in heaven; holy is thy name; thy kingdom\r\ncome; thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven;\r\n\r\n4  Give us this day our needed bread;\r\n\r\n5  Help us forget the debts that other people owe to us, that all our\r\ndebts may be discharged;\r\n\r\n6  And shield us from the tempter’s snares that are too great for us to\r\nbear;\r\n\r\n7  And when they come give us the strength to overcome.\r\n\r\n8  And Jesus said, The answer to your prayer may not appear in fulness\r\nin a little time.\r\n\r\n9  Be not discouraged; pray again and then again, for God will hear.\r\n\r\n10  And then he spoke a parable; he said, A housewife was alone at\r\nnight and, lo, some guests arrived, and they were hungry, having had\r\nno food for all the day.\r\n\r\n11  The housewife had no bread, and so at midnight she went forth and\r\ncalled a friend and said, Loan me three loaves of bread, for guests\r\nhave come, and I have naught for them to eat.\r\n\r\n12  The friend replied, Why do you trouble me at midnight hour? My door\r\nis shut; my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise to give you\r\nbread; tomorrow you can be supplied.\r\n\r\n13  The housewife asked again, and then again, and then because she\r\nplead, and would not be refused, the friend arose and gave her bread.\r\n\r\n14  Behold, I say to you, Ask firmly and you shall receive; seek\r\ntrustingly and you shall find; knock earnestly, the door will open up.\r\n\r\n15  All things are yours, and when you ask, not as a begging man would\r\nask, but as a child, you shall be satisfied.\r\n\r\n16  A son may ask his father for a loaf of bread; the father will not\r\ngive to him a stone;\r\n\r\n17  Or he may ask him for a fish; he will not give a crab; or he may\r\nask him for an egg; the father will not give a pebble from the brook.\r\n\r\n18  Behold, if men of flesh know how to give abundantly to children of\r\nthe flesh, will not your heavenly Father give abundantly to you when\r\nyou shall pray?\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 138.\r\n\r\n    _The Christines in Jerusalem. They meet a man blind from birth.\r\n      Jesus teaches a lesson on the cause of disease and disasters.\r\n      He heals the blind man._\r\n\r\nThe Lord with Peter, James and John were in Jerusalem; it was the\r\nSabbath day.\r\n\r\n2  And as they walked along the way they saw a man who could not see;\r\nhe had been blind from birth.\r\n\r\n3  And Peter said, Lord, if disease and imperfections all are caused by\r\nsin, who was the sinner in this case? the parents or the man himself?\r\n\r\n4  And Jesus said, Afflictions all are partial payments on a debt, or\r\ndebts, that have been made.\r\n\r\n5  There is a law of recompense that never fails, and it is summarized\r\nin that true rule of life:\r\n\r\n6  Whatsoever man shall do to any other man some other man will do to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n7  In this we find the meaning of the Jewish law, expressed concisely\r\nin the words, Tooth for a tooth; life for a life.\r\n\r\n8  He who shall injure any one in thought, or word, or deed, is judged\r\na debtor to the law, and some one else shall, likewise, injure him in\r\nthought, or word or deed.\r\n\r\n9  And he who sheds the blood of any man will come upon the time when\r\nhis blood shall be shed by man.\r\n\r\n10  Affliction is a prison cell in which a man must stay until he pays\r\nhis debts unless a master sets him free that he may have a better\r\nchance to pay his debts.\r\n\r\n11  Affliction is a certain sign that one has debts to pay.\r\n\r\n12  Behold this man! Once in another life he was a cruel man, and in a\r\ncruel way destroyed the eyes of one, a fellow man.\r\n\r\n13  The parents of this man once turned their faces on a blind and\r\nhelpless man, and drove him from their door.\r\n\r\n14  Then Peter asked, Do we pay off the debts of other men when by the\r\nWord we heal them, drive the unclean spirits out, or rescue them from\r\nany form of sore distress?\r\n\r\n15  And Jesus said, We cannot pay the debts of any man, but by the Word\r\nwe may release a man from his afflictions and distress,\r\n\r\n16  And make him free, that he may pay the debts he owes, by giving up\r\nhis life in willing sacrifice for men, or other living things.\r\n\r\n17  Behold, we may make free this man that he may better serve the race\r\nand pay his debts.\r\n\r\n18  Then Jesus called the man and said, Would you be free? would you\r\nreceive your sight?\r\n\r\n19  The man replied, All that I have would I most freely give if I\r\ncould see.\r\n\r\n20  And Jesus took saliva and a bit of clay and made a salve, and put\r\nit on the blind man’s eyes.\r\n\r\n21  He spoke the Word and then he said, Go to Siloam and wash, and as\r\nyou wash say, _Jahhevahe_. This do for seven times and you shall see.\r\n\r\n22  The man was led unto Siloam; he washed his eyes and spoke the word,\r\nand instantly his eyes were opened and he saw.\r\n\r\n23  The people who had seen the man for many years sit by the way and\r\nbeg, were much surprised to see him see.\r\n\r\n24  They said, Is not this man the Job that was born blind, who sat\r\nbeside the way and begged?\r\n\r\n25  He heard them talk among themselves; he said, Yes, I am he.\r\n\r\n26  The people asked, How were you healed? who opened up your eyes?\r\n\r\n27  He said, A man whom men call Jesus, made a salve of clay and put it\r\non my eyes, and bade me say a word and wash in Siloam seven times; I\r\ndid as he commanded me, and now I see.\r\n\r\n28  A certain scribe was passing, and he saw the man and heard him say\r\nthat Jesus, by the Word, had opened up his eyes.\r\n\r\n29  He therefore took the man up to the synagogue, and told the story\r\nto the priests, who asked the man about the miracle.\r\n\r\n30  The man replied, I never saw the light until today, for I was blind\r\nfrom birth.\r\n\r\n31  This morning as I sat beside Siloam, a man I never knew put on my\r\neyes a salve that people say he made of clay; he bade me say a word\r\nand bathe my eyes in water seven times; I did as he commanded and I\r\nsaw.\r\n\r\n32  A lawyer asked the man, Who was it opened up your eyes?\r\n\r\n33  The man replied, Some people say, His name is Jesus and that he\r\ncame from Galilee; but others say, He is the son of God.\r\n\r\n34  A Pharisee came up and said, This is the Sabbath day; a man who\r\ndoes a work like this, regarding not the Sabbath day, is not from God.\r\n\r\n35  Some of the priests were much amazed and said, A wicked man could\r\nnever do a miracle like this; he must possess the power of God. And so\r\nthey strove among themselves.\r\n\r\n36  They asked the man, What do you think about this man from Galilee?\r\n\r\n37  He said, He is a prophet sent from God.\r\n\r\n38  Now, many of the Jews did not believe the man was blind from birth;\r\nthey said, There is no power to open up the eyes of one born blind.\r\n\r\n39  And then they brought the parents of the man before the Pharisees\r\nthat they might testify.\r\n\r\n40  They said, This is our son who was born blind; we do not know how\r\nhe received his sight; he is of age and he can tell; ask him.\r\n\r\n41  They were afraid to say what they believed, that Jesus is the\r\nChrist who came to manifest the power of God, lest they offend the\r\npriests and be cast from the synagogue.\r\n\r\n42  Again the rulers said, This Jesus is a wicked man. The man who had\r\nbeen healed stood forth again and said,\r\n\r\n43  This Jesus may be sinner or be saint, I do not know; but this one\r\nthing I know; I once was blind, but now I see.\r\n\r\n44  And then the scribes and Pharisees reviled the man and said, You\r\nare a follower of this man from Galilee. We follow Moses, but this\r\nman, we know him not, and know not whence he is.\r\n\r\n45  The man replied, It is a marvel that you know not whence he is, and\r\nyet he opened up my eyes.\r\n\r\n46  You know that nothing but the power of God can do such things.\r\n\r\n47  God hears not sinners pray, and you must know that he is not a\r\nwicked man who can employ the power of God.\r\n\r\n48  The Pharisees replied, You wretch! you were begotten and were born\r\nin sin, and now you try to teach the law to us. And then they cast him\r\nfrom the synagogue.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 139.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus meets and instructs the man who was blind. Unfolds the\r\n      mysteries of the kingdom. The sheepfold. Declares himself\r\n      the shepherd. Goes to the home of Massalian, where he abides\r\n      certain days._\r\n\r\nWhen Jesus heard what had been done and how the priests had cast the\r\nman whom he had healed, out of the synagogue, he found the man and\r\nsaid to him,\r\n\r\n2  Do you believe in God and in the son of God?\r\n\r\n3  The man replied, I do believe in God; but who is he, the son of God,\r\nof whom you speak?\r\n\r\n4  And Jesus said, The son of God is he who speaks to you.\r\n\r\n5  The man inquired then, Why do you say, The son of God? Is there but\r\none?\r\n\r\n6  And Jesus said, All men are sons of God by birth; God is the Father\r\nof the race; but all are not the sons of God by faith.\r\n\r\n7  He who attains the victory over self is son of God by faith, and\r\nhe who speaks to you has overcome, and he is called the son of God,\r\nbecause he is the pattern for the sons of men.\r\n\r\n8  He who believes and does the will of God is son of God by faith.\r\n\r\n9  The man in joy exclaimed, Lord, I believe in God, and in the son of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n10  And Jesus said, I came to open prison doors, to make the blind to\r\nsee; but, lo, the Pharisees are blind from birth.\r\n\r\n11  And when I put the salve of truth upon their eyes, and bid them go\r\nand wash, and speak the sacred Word they will not go; they love the\r\ndark.\r\n\r\n12  A multitude of people pressed about the Lord, and he stood forth\r\nand said,\r\n\r\n13  You men of Israel, I say to you, The fold of God is large; its\r\nwalls are strong, it has a gateway in the east, and he who does not\r\nenter by the gate into the fold, but climbs into the fold some other\r\nway, is thief and comes to rob.\r\n\r\n14  The shepherd of the sheep stands by the gate; he gives the secret\r\nsign; he knocks; the watchman opens up the gate.\r\n\r\n15  And then the shepherd calls his sheep by name; they hear his voice\r\nand follow him; they enter through the gate into the fold.\r\n\r\n16  The sheep know not a stranger’s voice; they will not follow him;\r\nthey flee away.\r\n\r\n17  The people did not understand the parable that Jesus spoke; and\r\nthen he said,\r\n\r\n18  Christ is the gateway of the fold; I am the shepherd of the sheep,\r\nand he who follows me through Christ shall come into the fold where\r\nliving waters flow, and where rich pastures are.\r\n\r\n19  False prophets come and go; they claim to be the shepherds of the\r\nsheep; they claim to know the way, but they know not the word of\r\npower; the watchman opens not the gate; the sheep heed not their call.\r\n\r\n20  The shepherd of the sheep will give his life to save the sheep.\r\n\r\n21  A hireling flees to save his life when wolves infest the fold;\r\nand then the tender lambs are snatched away, the sheep are scattered\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\n22  I am the shepherd of the sheep; I know the sheep of God; they know\r\nmy voice, as God knows me and I know him.\r\n\r\n23  The Father loves me with a deathless love, because I lay my life\r\ndown for the sheep.\r\n\r\n24  I lay my life down when I will, but I may take it up again; for\r\nevery son of God by faith has power to lay his mortal flesh aside and\r\ntake it up again. These words I have received from God.\r\n\r\n25  Again the people strove among themselves; they were divided in\r\ntheir views concerning Christ. They could not comprehend the words\r\nthat Jesus spoke.\r\n\r\n26  Some said again, He is obsessed, or he is mad; why listen to his\r\nwords?\r\n\r\n27  And others said, His words are not the words of one obsessed. Can\r\nunclean spirits open up the eyes of one born blind?\r\n\r\n28  Then Jesus left Jerusalem and with Massalian he tarried certain\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 140.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus and the three disciples return to Capernaum. Jesus\r\n      receives the report of the seventy. With his disciples he\r\n      goes through all Galilee encouraging the believers. He heals\r\n      a woman. Relates the parable of the little seed and the great\r\n      tree._\r\n\r\nThe time had come for the return of the three score and ten whom Jesus\r\nsent abroad to preach.\r\n\r\n2  And Jesus, Peter, James and John began their journey back to Galilee.\r\n\r\n3  They went up through Samaria; they passed through many villages and\r\ntowns, and everywhere the people thronged the ways to see the man the\r\nseventy had told about; and Jesus taught and healed the sick.\r\n\r\n4  And when they reached Capernaum the seventy were there; and they\r\nwere filled with joy; they said,\r\n\r\n5  The Spirit of the Lord of hosts was with us all the way, and we were\r\nfilled.\r\n\r\n6  The power of the sacred Word was manifest in us; we healed the sick;\r\nwe caused the lame to walk, the deaf to hear, the blind to see.\r\n\r\n7  The very devils trembled when we spoke the Word, and they were\r\nsubject unto us.\r\n\r\n8  And Jesus said, As you were going on your way, the heavens were\r\nbright with light, the earth was bright, they seemed to meet and be at\r\none; and I beheld, and Satan fell as lightning from the heavens.\r\n\r\n9  Behold, for you have power to tread on serpents and on scorpions,\r\nand these are symbols of the enemies of men. You are protected in the\r\nway of right, and naught can harm.\r\n\r\n10  And as you went I heard a master say, Well done.\r\n\r\n11  But you may not rejoice because you have the power to heal the sick\r\nand make the devils tremble by the Word; for such rejoicing is from\r\ncarnal self.\r\n\r\n12  You may rejoice because the nations of the earth have ears to hear\r\nthe Word, and eyes to see the glory of the Lord, and hearts to feel\r\nthe inner breathing of the Holy Breath.\r\n\r\n13  And you may well be glad because your names are written in the Book\r\nof Life.\r\n\r\n14  Then Jesus looked to heaven and said, I thank thee, Father, Lord\r\nof heaven and earth, because thou hast revealed thyself to babes, and\r\ntaught them how to light the path and lead the wise to thee.\r\n\r\n15  What thou hast given to me, lo, I have given to them, and through\r\nthe sacred Word I have bestowed on them the understanding heart,\r\n\r\n16  That they might know and honor thee through Christ, who was, and\r\nis, and evermore shall be.\r\n\r\n17  And then he said aside, unto the seventy and twelve, Most blessed\r\nare your eyes because you see the things you see;\r\n\r\n18  And blessed are your ears because they hear the things they hear;\r\n\r\n19  And blessed are your hearts because you understand.\r\n\r\n20  In ages that are gone the wise of earth, the prophets, seers and\r\nkings, desired to hear and see and know what you have heard and seen\r\nand known; but they had not attained and could not hear, and see and\r\nknow.\r\n\r\n21  And Jesus said again, Lo, I have gone before you many moons, and I\r\nhave given to you the bread of heaven and the cup of life;\r\n\r\n22  Have been your buckler and your stay; but now that you have learned\r\nthe way, and have the strength to stand alone, behold, I lay my body\r\ndown and go to him who is the All.\r\n\r\n23  In forty days then we will turn our faces toward Jerusalem where I\r\nwill find the altar of the Lord and give my life in willing sacrifice\r\nfor men.\r\n\r\n24  Let us arise and go through all the coasts of Galilee, and give a\r\nsalutation of good cheer to all the sons of God by faith.\r\n\r\n25  And they arose and went; they entered every town and village on the\r\ncoast, and everywhere they said, The benedictions of the Christ abide\r\nwith you forevermore.\r\n\r\n26  Now, in a certain town they went up to the synagogue upon the\r\nSabbath day, and Jesus taught.\r\n\r\n27  And as he spoke, two men brought on a cot a woman bent near double\r\nwith disease; she had not risen from her bed for eighteen years\r\nwithout a helping hand.\r\n\r\n28  And Jesus laid his hand upon the woman, and he said, Arise, be free\r\nfrom your infirmity.\r\n\r\n29  And as he spoke the Word the woman found that she was straight and\r\nstrong, and she arose and walked and said, Praise God.\r\n\r\n30  The ruler of the synagogue was filled with wrath because the healer\r\nhealed upon the Sabbath day.\r\n\r\n31  He did not censure Jesus face to face, but turning to the\r\nmultitudes he said,\r\n\r\n32  You men of Galilee, why do you break the laws of God? There are\r\nsix days in every week when you may work, and then you may bring the\r\nafflicted to be healed.\r\n\r\n33  This is the day that God has blessed, the Sabbath day in which men\r\nmay not work.\r\n\r\n34  And Jesus said, You inconsistent scribes and Pharisees! Upon the\r\nSabbath day you take your beasts of burden from their stalls, and lead\r\nthem forth to eat and drink; is this not work?\r\n\r\n35  This daughter of your father Abraham, who has been bound for\r\neighteen years, has come in faith to be made free.\r\n\r\n36  Now, tell me, men, is it a crime to break her bonds and set her\r\nfree upon the Sabbath day?\r\n\r\n37  The ruler said no more; the people all rejoiced and said, Behold\r\nthe Christ!\r\n\r\n38  And Jesus spoke a parable; he said, The kingdom of the Christ is\r\nlike a little seed that one put in the ground;\r\n\r\n39  It grew and after many years became a mighty tree, and many people\r\nrested in its shade, and birds built nests and reared their young\r\namong its leafy boughs.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 141.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus speaks words of encouragement.

Relates a parable of a\r\n      wedding feast._\r\n\r\nAnd Jesus went into another town upon the coast and spoke good words\r\nof cheer to those who followed him.\r\n\r\n2  And one stood forth and said, Lord, are there few that enter into\r\nlife?\r\n\r\n3  And Jesus said, The way is rough that leads to life; the gate is\r\nnarrow and is guarded well; but every one who seeks in faith shall\r\nfind the way, and they who know the Word may enter in.\r\n\r\n4  But many seek the way for selfish gain; they pound upon the gate of\r\nlife; but it is fast.\r\n\r\n5  The watchman from the turret says, I know you not; your speech is\r\nthat of Ashdod, and your robes are those of sin; depart and go your\r\nway.\r\n\r\n6  And they will go their way with weeping and with gnashing of the\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\n7  And they will be enraged when they see their father Abraham with\r\nIsaac, Jacob and the prophets, resting in the kingdom of the Christ,\r\nand they themselves debarred.\r\n\r\n8  And, lo, I say that men will come from lands afar, from east, from\r\nwest, from north, from south and sit with me in consciousness of life.\r\n\r\n9  Behold, I say, the last shall be the first, the first shall be the\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n10  All men are called unto the kingdom of the Christ; but few are\r\nchosen, for the pure in heart alone can see the king.\r\n\r\n11  And as he spoke a Pharisee came up and said, You man of Galilee, if\r\nyou would save your life remain not here; flee instantly, for Herod\r\nswears that he will take your life, and even now his officers are\r\nseeking you.\r\n\r\n12  And Jesus said, Why is it that the Pharisees are so concerned about\r\nmy life? And then he said unto the man who spoke,\r\n\r\n13  Go forth and say to that sly fox, Behold, I heal the sick and cast\r\nthe unclean spirits out today, tomorrow, and the days to come, and\r\nthen I will attain.\r\n\r\n14  Go say to him, I need not fear in Galilee, for I must meet the\r\ncruel wrath of men within Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n15  And while they tarried in the place a man, a Pharisee, invited\r\nJesus and a few of those who followed him, to dine with him upon the\r\nSabbath day, to celebrate the marriage of his son.\r\n\r\n16  Among the guests was one afflicted with a dropsical disease.\r\n\r\n17  And Jesus said to those who had been sent to get from his own lips\r\nsome words by which they might accuse him of a crime,\r\n\r\n18  You lawyers and you Pharisees, what do you say about the\r\nlawlessness of healing on the Sabbath day? Here is a man, one of your\r\nown, and he is sore distressed.\r\n\r\n19  Shall I, in God’s own strength, say out the healing Word and heal\r\nthis man?\r\n\r\n20  The lawyers and the Pharisees were dumb; they answered not.\r\n\r\n21  Then Jesus spoke the healing Word and healed the man and he,\r\nrejoicing, went his way.\r\n\r\n22  Then Jesus said again unto the lawyers and the Pharisees, Which one\r\nof you who has a horse or cow, if it would fall into a pit upon the\r\nSabbath day would not call in his friends to help to draw it out?\r\n\r\n23  And not a man could answer, Here am I.\r\n\r\n24  As Jesus looked upon the guests who had been bidden to the feast\r\nand saw them crowding in to get the highest seats, he said to them,\r\n\r\n25  You selfish men why do you strive to take the highest seats when\r\nyou are but invited guests? You do not show our host the courtesies of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n26  When men are bidden to a marriage feast they should sit in the\r\nlower seats until the host shall place them where he wills.\r\n\r\n27  You may, unbidden, take the highest seat; but then a man more\r\nhonorable may come and when the host shall bid you rise and take a\r\nlower seat that he may honor his more worthy guest, you cannot help\r\nbut blush for very shame in your humility.\r\n\r\n28  But if you take the lowest seat and then are honored by your host\r\nand asked to take a higher seat, you are esteemed an honored guest.\r\n\r\n29  In this event we note a principle in life, That he who would exalt\r\nhimself shall be abased, and he who humbles low himself shall be\r\nexalted in the sight of men.\r\n\r\n30  Then Jesus spoke to all the guests; he said, When any one of you\r\nwould make a feast it should not be for friends, or kindred, or the\r\nrich;\r\n\r\n31  For they consider such a courtesy loaned out, and they feel called\r\nupon to make a greater feast for you, just in the payment of a debt.\r\n\r\n32  But when you make a feast invite the poor, the lame, the blind; in\r\nthis a blessing waits for you, for well you know that you will get\r\nnaught in return; but in the consciousness of helping those who need,\r\nyou will be recompensed.\r\n\r\n33  And then he spoke a parable: he said, A wealthy man prepared a\r\nfeast; he sent his servants forth to bid his chosen ones to come; but\r\nthey desired not to go, and they formed such excuses as they thought\r\nwould satisfy the would-be host.\r\n\r\n34  One said, I have just bought a piece of land, and I must go and\r\nprove my title to the land; I pray to be excused.\r\n\r\n35  Another said, I must go down and prove my ownership in sheep that I\r\nhave bought; I pray to be excused.\r\n\r\n36  Another said, I have been married but a little time and so I cannot\r\ngo; I beg to be excused.\r\n\r\n37  Now, when the servants came and told the man who had prepared the\r\nfeast that those he had invited would not come,\r\n\r\n38  The man was grieved in heart; and then he sent his servants forth\r\ninto the streets and alleys of the town to bring up to the feast the\r\npoor, the lame, the blind.\r\n\r\n39  The servants went abroad and found the poor, the lame, the blind,\r\nand brought them in; but there was room for more.\r\n\r\n40  The host then sent his men of arms to bring by force the people to\r\nhis feast; and then the house was full.\r\n\r\n41  And God has made a feast for men. Long years ago he sent his\r\nservants forth unto the favored sons of men. They would not hear his\r\ncall; they came not to the feast.\r\n\r\n42  He then sent forth his servants to the strangers and the\r\nmultitudes; they came, but there is room for more.\r\n\r\n43  Behold, for he will send his angels forth with mighty trumpet\r\nblast, and men will be compelled to come up to the feast.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 142.\r\n\r\n    _The path of discipleship, its difficulties.

Parable of the rich man and\r\n      Lazarus._\r\n\r\nNow, Jesus and the twelve went to another town, and as they entered it\r\nthey said, Peace be to all; good will to all.\r\n\r\n2  A multitude of people followed and the master said to them, Behold,\r\nfor you are followers for selfish gain.\r\n\r\n3  If you would follow me in love, and be disciples of the Holy Breath,\r\nand gain at last the crown of life, you must leave all there is of\r\ncarnal life behind.\r\n\r\n4  Be not deceived; stay, men, and count the cost.\r\n\r\n5  If one would build a tower, or a home, he first sits down and counts\r\nthe cost to be assured that he has gold enough to finish it.\r\n\r\n6  For well he knows that if he makes a failure of his enterprise he\r\nmay lose all his wealth, and be the butt of ridicule.\r\n\r\n7  And if a king desires to take the kingdom of another king, he calls\r\nhis trusted men and they consider well their strength; he will not\r\nmeasure arms with one of matchless power.\r\n\r\n8  Count well the cost before you start to follow me; it means the\r\ngiving up of life, and all you have.\r\n\r\n9  If you love father, mother, wife, or child, more than you love the\r\nChrist, you cannot follow me.\r\n\r\n10  If you love wealth or honor more than you love the Christ, you\r\ncannot follow me.\r\n\r\n11  The paths of carnal life do not run up the mountain side towards\r\nthe top; they run around the mount of life, and if you go straight to\r\nthe upper gate of consciousness you cross the paths of carnal life;\r\ntread in them not.\r\n\r\n12  And this is how men bear the cross; no man can bear another’s cross.\r\n\r\n13  Take up your cross and follow me through Christ into the path of\r\ntrue discipleship; this is the path that leads to life.\r\n\r\n14  This way of life is called the pearl of greatest price, and he who\r\nfinds it must put all he has beneath his feet.\r\n\r\n15  Behold, a man found in a certain field the croppings of a wondrous\r\nmine of gold, and he went forth and sold his home and all he had and\r\nbought the field; then he rejoiced in wealth.\r\n\r\n16  Now, there were present, scribes and Pharisees of wealth who loved\r\ntheir money, and their bonds and lands, and they laughed loud to scorn\r\nwhat Jesus said.\r\n\r\n17  Then Jesus spoke to them and said, You are the men who justify\r\nyourselves in sight of men; God knows your wickedness of heart;\r\n\r\n18  And you must know, O men, that whatsoever is revered and is exalted\r\nby the carnal mind, is an abomination in the sight of God.\r\n\r\n19  And Jesus went his way, and as he went a young man ran and knelt\r\ndown at his feet and said, Good master, tell me what to do that I may\r\nhave eternal life.\r\n\r\n20  And Jesus said, Why do you call me good? No one is truly good but\r\nGod himself.\r\n\r\n21  And God has said, If you would enter into life, keep the\r\nCommandments of the law.\r\n\r\n22  The young man asked, To which commands did he refer?\r\n\r\n23  And Jesus said, You shall not kill; you shall not steal; you shall\r\nnot do adulterous things; you shall not falsely testify;\r\n\r\n24  And you shall love your God with all your heart, and you shall love\r\nyour neighbor as yourself.\r\n\r\n25  The man replied, These things I have observed from youth; what lack\r\nI yet?\r\n\r\n26  And Jesus said, One thing you lack; your heart is fixed on things\r\nof earth; you are not free.\r\n\r\n27  Go forth and sell all that you have, and give your money to the\r\npoor, and come and follow me, and you shall have eternal life.\r\n\r\n28  The man was grieved at what the master said; for he was rich; he\r\nhid his face and went in sorrow on his way.\r\n\r\n29  And Jesus looked upon the sorrowing man and said, It is so hard for\r\nmen with hoarded wealth to enter through the door into the kingdom of\r\nthe soul.\r\n\r\n30  And his disciples were amazed at what he said.\r\n\r\n31  He answered them and said, I tell you, men, that they who trust in\r\nriches cannot trust in God and cannot come into the kingdom of the\r\nsoul;\r\n\r\n32  Yea, it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye than for\r\na man with hoarded wealth to find the way of life. And his disciples\r\nsaid, Who then can find the way? Who can be saved?\r\n\r\n33  And Jesus said, The rich may give his gold away; the high may kiss\r\nthe dust, and God will save.\r\n\r\n34  Then Jesus spoke this parable to them:\r\n\r\n35  A rich man lived in splendid state; he wore the finest garments men\r\ncould make; his boards were loaded with the costliest viands of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\n36  A beggar, blind and lame, whose name was Lazarus, was wont to sit\r\nbeside the waste gate of this home that he might share with dogs the\r\nrefuse from the rich man’s boards.\r\n\r\n37  It came to pass that Lazarus died, and angels carried him away unto\r\nthe bosom of our father Abraham.\r\n\r\n38  The rich man also died, and he was buried in a costly tomb; but in\r\nthe purifying fires he opened up his eyes dissatisfied.\r\n\r\n39  He looked and saw the beggar resting peacefully in the bosom of his\r\nfather Abraham, and in the bitterness of his soul he cried,\r\n\r\n40  My father Abraham, look down in mercy on your son; I am tormented\r\nin these flames.\r\n\r\n41  Send Lazarus, I beseech, that he may give me just a sup of water to\r\ncool my parched tongue.\r\n\r\n42  But Abraham replied, My son, in mortal life, you had the best\r\nthings of the earth and Lazarus had the worst, and you would not give\r\nhim a cup of water there, but drove him from your door.\r\n\r\n43  The law must be fulfilled, and Lazarus now is comforted, and you\r\nare paying what you owe.\r\n\r\n44  Besides, there is a great gulf fixed between your zone and us, and\r\nif I would I could not send Lazarus to you, and you cannot come up to\r\nus till you have paid your debts.\r\n\r\n45  Again the man in anguish said, O father Abraham, I pray, send\r\nLazarus back to earth, and to my father’s house, that he may tell\r\nmy brothers who are yet in life, for I have five of them, about the\r\nhorrors of this place, lest they come down to me and not to you.\r\n\r\n46  And Abraham replied, They have the words of Moses and the seers,\r\nlet them hear them.\r\n\r\n47  The man replied, They will not hearken to the written word; but if\r\na man would go up from the grave they might believe.\r\n\r\n48  But Abraham replied, If they hear not the words of Moses and the\r\nseers they would not be persuaded even though one from the dead stood\r\nin their midst.\r\n\r\n49  And Peter said, Lord, we have left our all to follow you; and what\r\nis our reward?\r\n\r\n50  And Jesus said, Most verily I say to you, that you who have left\r\nall to follow me shall come into a newness of a life hid deep with\r\nChrist in God.\r\n\r\n51  And you shall sit with me upon the throne of power, and judge with\r\nme the tribes of Israel.\r\n\r\n52  And he who conquers carnal self, and follows me through Christ\r\nshall have a hundred fold of that which is the wealth of life on\r\nearth, and in the world to come, eternal life.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 143.\r\n\r\n    _Righteousness in rewards. Jesus relates the parable of the\r\n      husbandman and the laborers. Makes known the divine law of\r\n      divorce. The mystery of marriage._\r\n\r\nThe Lord was standing by the sea; the multitudes were there and one\r\nstood forth and said,\r\n\r\n2  Does God bestow rewards as men bestow rewards, for what is done?\r\n\r\n3  And Jesus said, Men never know what other men have done, this life\r\nis such a seeming life.\r\n\r\n4  One man may seem to do a mighty work, and be adjudged by men as\r\nworthy of a great reward.\r\n\r\n5  Another man may seem to be a failure in the harvest fields of life,\r\nand be dishonored in the face of men.\r\n\r\n6  Men do not know the hearts of men; God only knows the hearts of men,\r\nand when the day is done he may reward with life the man who fell\r\nbeneath the burdens of the day, and turn away the man who was the idol\r\nof the hearts of men.\r\n\r\n7  And then he spoke a parable; he said, The kingdom of the soul is\r\nlike a man who had a vast estate,\r\n\r\n8  And in the morning time he went down to the market place to search\r\nfor men to gather in his grain.\r\n\r\n9  He found three men, and he agreed to give to each a penny for his\r\nservice for the day, and sent them to his field.\r\n\r\n10  Again he went down to the market place the third hour of the day\r\nand found five men in waiting, and he said, Go down into my field and\r\nserve, and I will pay you what is right; and they went down and served.\r\n\r\n11  He went again; it was the sixth hour of the day, and seven men were\r\nwaiting at the stand; he sent them to the field to serve.\r\n\r\n12  And at the eleventh hour he went again; twelve men stood there in\r\nseeming idleness; he said to them, Why stand you here in idleness all\r\nday?\r\n\r\n13  They said, Because we have no work to do; no man has hired us.\r\n\r\n14  And then he sent them to his field to serve.\r\n\r\n15  Now, when the evening came the man said to his steward, Call the\r\nlaborers from the field, and pay them for his services. And all were\r\npaid, and each received a penny for his hire.\r\n\r\n16  Now, when the twelve, who served but from the eleventh hour,\r\nreceived each one a penny for his hire, the three were sore aggrieved;\r\nthey said,\r\n\r\n17  These twelve have served but one short hour, and now they have an\r\nequal share with us who have toiled through the scorching hours of\r\nday; should we not have at least two pennies for our hire?\r\n\r\n18  The man replied, My friends, I do no wrong to you. Did we not have\r\na fast agreement when you went to work? have I not paid in full?\r\n\r\n19  What is it unto you if I should pay these men a smaller or a larger\r\nsum? Take that which is your own and go your way, for I will give unto\r\nthe twelve what I will give unto the three, the five, the seven.\r\n\r\n20  They did their best and you could do no more than do your best.\r\n\r\n21  The hire of man is based upon the intent of the heart.\r\n\r\n22  As Jesus taught, a Pharisee came up and said, Lord, is it lawful\r\nfor a man to put away his wife?\r\n\r\n23  And Jesus said, You ought to know; what says the law?\r\n\r\n24  The Pharisee replied, The law provides that man may be divorced,\r\nmay put away his wife.\r\n\r\n25  And Jesus said, The hardness of the hearts of men induced the giver\r\nof the law to make provisions such as these; but from the first it was\r\nnot so.\r\n\r\n26  God made a woman for a man, and they were one; and afterwards he\r\nsaid, A man shall leave his father and his mother and shall cleave\r\nunto his wife; they are no more divided; they are one, one flesh.\r\n\r\n27  What God has joined no man can part.\r\n\r\n28  Now, when they went up to the house, a man made free to ask again\r\nabout this matter of divorce.\r\n\r\n29  And Jesus said again what to the Pharisee he said; and then he gave\r\nthe higher law of marriage life:\r\n\r\n30  Whoever puts away his wife, except she be a courtesan, and then\r\nshall take another wife commits adultery.\r\n\r\n31  The woman who shall leave a man, unless he be a libertine and\r\nan adulterer, and then becomes the wife of any other man, commits\r\nadultery.\r\n\r\n32  And Thomas asked, What is adultery?\r\n\r\n33  And Jesus said, The man who harbors lustful thoughts, who covets\r\nany woman not his wife, is an adulterer.\r\n\r\n34  The wife who harbors lustful thoughts, and covets any man who is\r\nnot wed to her, is not her husband, is a courtesan.\r\n\r\n35  Men cannot make a law to bind two hearts.\r\n\r\n36  When two are bound in love they have no thought of lust. The woman\r\ncannot leave the man; the man has no desire to send his wife away.\r\n\r\n37  When men and women harbor lustful thoughts, and covet any other\r\nflesh, they are not one, not joined by God.\r\n\r\n38  And Philip said, Lord, are there few that God has joined in holy\r\nmarriage bonds?\r\n\r\n39  And Jesus said, God knows the pure in heart; the lustful men and\r\nwomen are but creatures of the lustful self; they cannot be at one;\r\nnor can they be at one with God.\r\n\r\n40  Nathaniel said, Is it not well that all men should refrain from\r\ntaking on themselves the marriage vow?\r\n\r\n41  And Jesus said, Men are not pure because they are unmarried men.\r\nThe man who lusts is an adulterer if he has wife or not.\r\n\r\n42  And then he said to all, Some things men know by being told, while\r\nother things they know not till the gate of consciousness shall open\r\nup for them.\r\n\r\n43  I speak a mystery that now you cannot understand; but you shall\r\nsome day understand.\r\n\r\n44  A eunuch is a man who does not lust; some men are eunuchs born,\r\nsome men are eunuchs by the power of men, and some are eunuchs by the\r\nHoly Breath, who makes them free in God through Christ.\r\n\r\n45  He who is able to receive the truth I speak, let him receive.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 144.\r\n\r\n    _The Christines at Tiberius. Jesus speaks on the inner life.\r\n      Relates the parable of the prodigal son. The resentment of\r\n      the elder brother._\r\n\r\nWhen they had journeyed through the towns and cities of the land of\r\nGalilee, the Lord with his disciples came to Tiberius, and here they\r\nmet a few who loved the name of Christ.\r\n\r\n2  And Jesus told them many things about the inner life; but when the\r\nmultitudes came up, he spoke a parable; he said,\r\n\r\n3  A certain man with great possessions had two sons. The youngest son\r\ngrew tired of life at home and said,\r\n\r\n4  My father, pray divide your wealth and give the portion that is mine\r\nto me, and I will seek my fortune in another land.\r\n\r\n5  The father did as he desired, and with his wealth the young man went\r\ninto a foreign land.\r\n\r\n6  He was a profligate and soon had squandered all his wealth in ways\r\nof sin.\r\n\r\n7  When nothing else remained for him to do he found employment in the\r\nfields to care for swine.\r\n\r\n8  And he was hungry and no one gave him aught to eat, and so he ate\r\nthe carob pods that he was feeding to the swine.\r\n\r\n9  And after many days he found himself and said unto himself, My\r\nfather is a man of wealth; he has a score of servants who are\r\nbountifully fed while I, his son, am starving in the fields among the\r\nswine.\r\n\r\n10  I do not hope to be received again as son, but I will rise and\r\ngo straight to my father’s house, and I will make confession of my\r\nwaywardness;\r\n\r\n11  And I will say, My father, I am come again; I am a profligate, and\r\nI have lost my wealth in ways of sin; I am not worthy to be called\r\nyour son.\r\n\r\n12  I do not ask to be received again as son, but let me have a place\r\namong your servants, where I may have a shelter from the storms and\r\nhave enough to eat.\r\n\r\n13  And he arose and sought his father’s house, and as he came his\r\nmother saw him while yet a great way off.\r\n\r\n14  (A mother’s heart can feel the first faint yearning of a wandering\r\nchild.)\r\n\r\n15  The father came, and hand in hand they walked a-down the way to\r\nmeet the boy, and there was joy, great joy.\r\n\r\n16  The boy tried hard to plead for mercy and a servant’s place; but\r\nlove was all too great to listen to the plea.\r\n\r\n17  The door was opened wide; he found a welcome in the mother’s heart,\r\nand in the father’s heart.\r\n\r\n18  The father called the servants in, and bade them bring the finest\r\nrobe for him; the choicest sandals for his feet; a ring of purest gold\r\nfor him to wear.\r\n\r\n19  And then the father said, My servants, go and kill the fatted calf;\r\nprepare a feast, for we are glad;\r\n\r\n20  Our son we thought was dead is here alive; a treasure that we\r\nthought was lost is found.\r\n\r\n21  The feast was soon prepared and all were merry, when the eldest son\r\nwho had been serving in a distant field and knew not that his brother\r\nhad returned, came home.\r\n\r\n22  And when he learned the cause of all the merriment he was offended,\r\nand would not go into the house.\r\n\r\n23  His father and his mother both besought him tearfully to disregard\r\nthe waywardness and folly of their son; but he would not; he said,\r\n\r\n24  Lo, all these years I have remained at home, have served you every\r\nday, have never yet transgressed your most severe commands;\r\n\r\n25  And yet you never killed for me a kid, nor made for me a simple\r\nfeast that I might make merry with my friends;\r\n\r\n26  But when your son, this profligate, who has gone forth and\r\nsquandered half your wealth in ways of sin, comes home, because he\r\ncould do nothing else, you kill for him the fatted calf and make a\r\nwondrous feast.\r\n\r\n27  His father said, My son, all that I have is yours and you are ever\r\nwith us in our joys;\r\n\r\n28  And it is well to show our gladness when your brother, who is near\r\nand dear to us, and who we thought was dead, returns to us alive.\r\n\r\n29  He may have been a profligate; may have consorted with gay\r\ncourtesans and thieves, yet he is still your brother and our son.\r\n\r\n30  Then Jesus said so all might hear: He who has ears to hear, and\r\nhearts to understand will comprehend the meaning of this parable.\r\n\r\n31  Then Jesus and the twelve came to Capernaum.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 145.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus speaks on the establishment of the Christine kingdom\r\n      and the future coming of the Lord in power. Exhorts to\r\n      faithfulness. Parable of the unjust judge. Parable of the\r\n      Pharisee and the publican._\r\n\r\nA company of Pharisees came up to speak with Jesus and they said,\r\nRabboni, we have heard you say, The kingdom is at hand.\r\n\r\n2  We read in Daniel that the God of heaven will form a kingdom, and we\r\nask, Is this the kingdom of the God you speak about? If so, when will\r\nit come?\r\n\r\n3  And Jesus said, The prophets all have told about this kingdom of the\r\nGod, and it is just at hand; but men can never see it come.\r\n\r\n4  It never can be seen with carnal eyes; it is within.\r\n\r\n5  Lo, I have said, and now I say again, None but the pure in heart can\r\nsee the king, and all the pure in heart are subjects of the king.\r\n\r\n6  Reform, and turn away from sin; prepare you, O prepare! the kingdom\r\nis at hand.\r\n\r\n7  And then he spoke to his disciples and he said, The seasons of the\r\nson of man are past.\r\n\r\n8  The time will come when you will wish above all else to see again\r\none of these days; but you can see it not.\r\n\r\n9  And many men will say, Lo, here is Christ; lo, there is Christ. Be\r\nnot deceived; go not into their ways.\r\n\r\n10  For when the son of man will come again no man need point the way;\r\nfor as the lightning lights the heavens, so will the son of man light\r\nup the heavens and earth.\r\n\r\n11  But, lo, I say, that many generations will have come and gone\r\nbefore the son of man shall come in power; but when he comes no one\r\nwill say, Lo, here is Christ; lo, there.\r\n\r\n12  But as it was before the flood in Noah’s day, so shall it be. The\r\npeople ate, they drank, were filled with merriment and sung for joy,\r\n\r\n13  And did not know their doom until the ark was done and Noah entered\r\nin; but then the flood came on and swept them all away.\r\n\r\n14  So, also, in the days of Lot; the people ate and drank; they\r\nbought, they sold, they planted and they reaped, they went their ways\r\nin sin, and they cared not;\r\n\r\n15  But when the righteous Lot went from their city’s gates the earth\r\nbeneath the city shook, and brimstone fires fell from heaven;\r\n\r\n16  The gapping jaws of earth flew wide, and swallowed up their homes,\r\ntheir wealth, and they went down to rise no more.\r\n\r\n17  So shall it be when comes the son of man in power.\r\n\r\n18  I charge you men, as I will charge men then, Seek not to save your\r\nwealth, or you will lose your lives. Go forth, and look not back upon\r\nthe crumbling walls of sin. Do not forget Lot’s wife.\r\n\r\n19  Whoever tries to save his life will lose his life; whoever freely\r\ngives his life in serving life will save his life.\r\n\r\n20  Then comes the sifting time. Two men will be in bed; one will be\r\ncalled, the other left; two women will be working side by side; one\r\nwill be snatched away, the other left.\r\n\r\n21  And his disciples said, Explain to us this parable; or is it not a\r\nparable?\r\n\r\n22  And Jesus said, The wise will understand, for where the bread\r\nof heaven is, there you will find the pure in heart; and where the\r\ncarcass lies will gather all the birds of prey.\r\n\r\n23  But, lo, I say, before these days will come, the son of man will be\r\nbetrayed by one of you into the hands of wicked men, and he will give\r\nhis life for you and all the world.\r\n\r\n24  Yea, more; the Holy Breath will come in power and fill you with the\r\nwisdom of the just.\r\n\r\n25  And you will tell the wondrous story in Judea and in Samaria and in\r\nthe farther lands of earth.\r\n\r\n26  And then to teach that men should pray and never faint, he told\r\nthis parable:\r\n\r\n27  There was a judge who feared not God, nor yet regarded man.\r\n\r\n28  There was a widow who oft implored the judge to right her wrongs\r\nand to avenge her foes.\r\n\r\n29  At first the judge would hear her not, but after many days he said,\r\n\r\n30  I fear not God, and I regard not man, yet, lest this widow wear me\r\nout by pleading every day I will avenge her on her foes.\r\n\r\n31  When the disciples asked the meaning of this parable, the Lord\r\nreplied, The wise can understand; the foolish have no need to know.\r\n\r\n32  And then to teach a lesson unto certain of his followers who\r\ntrusted in themselves and thought that they were holier than other\r\nmen, he told this parable:\r\n\r\n33  Two men went to the synagogue to pray; one was a Pharisee, the\r\nother was a publican.\r\n\r\n34  The Pharisee stood forth and prayed thus with himself, O God, I\r\nthank thee that I am not like other men, who are extortioners, unjust,\r\nadulterers;\r\n\r\n35  Not even like this publican. I fast two times a week, and I give\r\ntithes of all I get.\r\n\r\n36  The publican came not a-near; he would not lift his eyes to heaven,\r\nbut smote his breast and said,\r\n\r\n37  O Lord, be merciful to me; I am a sinner in thy sight; I am undone.\r\n\r\n38  And now, you men, I say to you, The publican knew how to pray, and\r\nhe was justified.\r\n\r\n39  The Pharisee knew how to talk, but still he went away condemned.\r\n\r\n40  Lo, every one who lauds himself shall be abased, and he who does\r\nnot praise himself shall be exalted in the sight of God.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 146.\r\n\r\n    _Last meeting of Jesus with his disciples in Galilee.

Amen.\r\n\r\n17  And Jesus lifted up his eyes to heaven and said,\r\n\r\n18  My Father-God, let now the benediction of thy love, thy mercy and\r\nthy truth rest on these men.\r\n\r\n19  The lamp is taken from their midst, and if the inner light be not\r\naflame, lo, they must tread the ways of darkness and of death.\r\n\r\n20  And then he said to all, Farewell.\r\n\r\n21  Then Jesus and his mother, and the twelve, and Miriam and Mary,\r\nmother of the two disciples, James and John,\r\n\r\n22  And many other loyal souls who loved the Christ, went to Jerusalem,\r\nthat they might celebrate the Jewish feast.\r\n\r\n23  And as they journeyed on their way they came to Enon Springs, near\r\nunto Salim where the harbinger once taught.\r\n\r\n24  And as they rested by the fountain, Mary, wife of Zebedee, and\r\nmother of the two disciples, James and John, came to the master and\r\nshe said,\r\n\r\n25  My Lord, I know the kingdom is about to come, and I would ask this\r\nboon: Command that these my sons shall sit with you upon the throne,\r\nthe one upon the right, the other on the left.\r\n\r\n26  And Jesus said to her, You know not what you ask.\r\n\r\n27  And then he turned to James and John and said, Are you prepared and\r\nare you strong enough to drink the cup that I will drink?\r\n\r\n28  They said, Yes, master, we are strong enough to follow where you go.\r\n\r\n29  Then Jesus said, You shall indeed drink of my cup; but I am not the\r\njudge of who will sit upon my right hand or my left.\r\n\r\n30  The men who live the life and keep the faith will sit upon the\r\nthrone of power.\r\n\r\n31  Now, when the apostles heard the pleadings of the mother for her\r\nsons, and knew that James and John were seeking special favors from\r\nthe Lord, they were indignant and they said,\r\n\r\n32  We surely thought that James and John had risen above the selfish\r\nself. Who can we trust among the sons of men?\r\n\r\n33  And Jesus called the ten apart and said to them, How hard for men\r\nto comprehend the nature of the kingdom of the soul!\r\n\r\n34  These two disciples do not seem to know that rulership in heaven is\r\nnot akin to rulership on earth.\r\n\r\n35  In all the kingdoms of the world, the men of power, they who exalt\r\nthemselves, show their authority, and rule with iron rule;\r\n\r\n36  But you must know that they who rule the sons of light are they who\r\nseek no earthly power, but give their lives in willing sacrifice for\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n37  Whoever would be great must be the minister of all. The highest\r\nseat in heaven is at the feet of him who is the lowest man of earth.\r\n\r\n38  I had a glory with our Father-God before the worlds were made, and\r\nstill I come to serve the race of men; to be the minister of men; to\r\ngive my life for men.\r\n\r\n39  And then the Christines journeyed on and came unto Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 147.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus speaks to the people in the temple regarding the\r\n      messiahship. Rebukes the Jews for treachery. The Jews attempt\r\n      to stone him, but are prevented by Joseph. The Christines go\r\n      to Jericho, and later to Bethabara._\r\n\r\nNow, many Jews from Galilee, Judea and Samaria were in Jerusalem and\r\nat the feast.\r\n\r\n2  The porch of Solomon was filled with scribes and Pharisees and\r\ndoctors of the law, and Jesus walked with them.\r\n\r\n3  A scribe approaching Jesus said, Rabboni, why do you keep the people\r\nwaiting in suspense? If you are the Messiah that the prophets said\r\nwould come, will you not tell us now?\r\n\r\n4  And Jesus said, Lo, I have told you many times, but you believed me\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n5  No man can do the work that I have done and bring to men the truth\r\nas I have brought the truth who did not come from God.\r\n\r\n6  What I have done and said are witnesses for me.\r\n\r\n7  God calls, and they whose ears have been attuned to hear the\r\nheavenly voice have heard the call and have believed in me; because\r\nGod testifies for me.\r\n\r\n8  You cannot hear the voice of God, because your ears are closed. You\r\ncannot comprehend the works of God, because your hearts are full of\r\nself.\r\n\r\n9  And you are busy-bodies, mischief-makers, hypocrites. You take these\r\nmen whom God has given me into your haunts and try to poison them with\r\nsophistries and lies, and think that you will snatch them from the\r\nfold of God.\r\n\r\n10  I tell you, men, these men are tried and you can snatch not one of\r\nthem away.\r\n\r\n11  My Father who has given them to me is greater than you all, and he\r\nand I are one.\r\n\r\n12  And then the Jews took stones to throw at him and cried, Now we\r\nhave heard enough; away with him; let him be stoned.\r\n\r\n13  But Joseph, member of the great Sanhedrim of the Jews, was in the\r\nporch and he came forth and said,\r\n\r\n14  You men of Israel, do nothing rash; throw down those stones; your\r\nreason is a better guide than passion in such times as these.\r\n\r\n15  You do not know your accusations to be true, and if this man should\r\nprove himself to be the Christ, and you should take his life, the\r\nwrath of God would rest upon you evermore.\r\n\r\n16  And Jesus said to them, Lo, I have healed your sick, have caused\r\nyour blind to see, your deaf to hear, your lame to walk, and cast out\r\nunclean spirits from your friends;\r\n\r\n17  For which of these great works would you desire to take my life?\r\n\r\n18  The Jews replied, We would not stone you for your works of grace,\r\nbut for your vile, blasphemous words. You are but man and still you\r\nsay that you are God.\r\n\r\n19  And Jesus said, A prophet of your own said to the sons of men, Lo,\r\nyou are gods!\r\n\r\n20  Now, hark, you men, if he could say that to the men who simply\r\nheard the word of God, why should you think that I blaspheme the name\r\nof God because I say, I am a son of God?\r\n\r\n21  If you believe not what I say you must have faith in what I do, and\r\nyou should see the Father in these works, and know that I dwell in the\r\nFather-God, and that the Father dwells in me.\r\n\r\n22  And then again the Jews took stones and would have stoned him in\r\nthe temple court; but he withdrew himself from sight and left the\r\nporch and court and went his way;\r\n\r\n23  And with the twelve he went to Jericho, and after certain days\r\nthey crossed the Jordan and in Bethabara abode for many days.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 148.\r\n\r\n    _Lazarus dies and Jesus and the twelve return to Bethany. The\r\n      resurrection of Lazarus, which greatly excites the rulers in\r\n      Jerusalem. The Christines go to the hills of Ephriam, and\r\n      there abide._\r\n\r\nOne day as Jesus and the twelve were in the silence in a home in Araba\r\na messenger came and said,\r\n\r\n2  Lord, Jesus, hear! your friend in Bethany is sick, nigh unto death;\r\nhis sisters urge that you arise and come in haste.\r\n\r\n3  Then turning to the twelve the master said, Lo, Lazarus has gone to\r\nsleep, and I must go and waken him.\r\n\r\n4  And his disciples said, What need to go if he has gone to sleep; he\r\nwill awaken by and by?\r\n\r\n5  Then Jesus said, It is the sleep of death; for Lazarus is dead.\r\n\r\n6  But Jesus did not haste to go; he stayed two days in Araba; and then\r\nhe said, The hour has come and we must go to Bethany.\r\n\r\n7  But his disciples urged him not to go; they said, The Jews are\r\nwaiting your return that they may take your life.\r\n\r\n8  And Jesus said, Men cannot take my life till I have handed unto them\r\nmy life.\r\n\r\n9  And when the time shall come I will myself lay down my life; that\r\ntime is near, and God knows best; I must arise and go.\r\n\r\n10  And Thomas said, Then we will also go; yes, we will offer up our\r\nlives and die with him. And they arose and went.\r\n\r\n11  Now, Mary, Martha, Ruth and many friends were weeping in their home\r\nwhen one approached and said, The Lord has come; but Mary did not hear\r\nthe words.\r\n\r\n12  But Ruth and Martha heard, and they arose and went to meet the\r\nLord; he waited at the village gate.\r\n\r\n13  And when they met the master Martha said, You are too late, for\r\nLazarus is dead; if you had only been with us I know that he would not\r\nhave died.\r\n\r\n14  But even now I know that you have power over death; that by the\r\nsacred Word you may cause life to rise from death.\r\n\r\n15  And Jesus said, Behold, for Lazarus shall live again.\r\n\r\n16  And Martha said, I know that he will rise and live again when all\r\nthe dead shall rise.\r\n\r\n17  And Jesus said, I am the resurrection and the life; he who has\r\nfaith in me, though he be dead, yet shall he live;\r\n\r\n18  And he who is alive, and has a living faith in me, shall never die.\r\nDo you believe what I have said?\r\n\r\n19  And Martha said, Lord, I believe that you are come to manifest the\r\nChrist of God.\r\n\r\n20  Then Jesus said, Go back and call aside your sister, and my mother\r\nand the prophetess and say that I have come; and I will stay here by\r\nthe gate till they have come to me.\r\n\r\n21  And Ruth and Martha did as Jesus bade them do, and in a little\r\nwhile the Marys and the prophetess had met the Lord.\r\n\r\n22  And Mary said, Why did you tarry thus? If you had been with us our\r\nbrother, dear, would not have died.\r\n\r\n23  Then Jesus went up to the house and when he saw the heavy grief of\r\nall, he was himself stirred up with grief, and said, Where is the\r\ntomb in which he lies?\r\n\r\n24  They said, Lord, come and see. And Jesus wept.\r\n\r\n25  The people said, Behold how Jesus loved this man!\r\n\r\n26  And others said, Could not this Lord who opened up the eyes of one\r\nborn blind, have saved this man from death?\r\n\r\n27  But soon the mourners stood beside the tomb, a sepulcher hewn out\r\nof solid rock; a massive stone closed up the door.\r\n\r\n28  And Jesus said, Take you away the stone.\r\n\r\n29  But Martha said, Lord, is it well? Behold our brother has been dead\r\nfour days; the body must be in decay, and is it well that we should\r\nsee it now?\r\n\r\n30  The Lord replied, Have you forgotten, Martha, what I said while we\r\nwere at the village gate? Did I not say that you should see the glory\r\nof the Lord?\r\n\r\n31  And then they rolled the stone away; the flesh had not decayed; and\r\nJesus lifted up his eyes to heaven and said,\r\n\r\n32  My Father-God, thou who hast ever heard my prayers, I thank thee\r\nnow, and that these multitudes may know that thou hast sent me forth,\r\nthat I am thine and thou art mine, make strong the Word of power.\r\n\r\n33  And then he spoke the Word, and in a voice that souls can\r\ncomprehend, he said, O Lazarus, awake!\r\n\r\n34  And Lazarus arose and came out of the tomb. The grave clothes were\r\nabout him fast, and Jesus said,\r\n\r\n35  Loose him and let him go.\r\n\r\n36  The people were amazed and multitudes confessed their faith in him.\r\n\r\n37  And some went to Jerusalem and told the Pharisees about this\r\nresurrection of the dead.\r\n\r\n38  The chief priests were confounded, and they said, What shall we do?\r\nThis man is doing many mighty deeds, and if we do not stay him in his\r\nwork, all men will look on him as king, and through the Romans he may\r\ntake the throne, and we will lose our place and power.\r\n\r\n39  And then the chief priests and the Pharisees in council met and\r\nsought a plan by which they might put him to death.\r\n\r\n40  Caiaphas was the high priest then, and he came forth and said, You\r\nmen of Israel, do you not know the law?\r\n\r\n41  Do you not know that in such times as these we may give up one life\r\nto save our nation and our laws?\r\n\r\n42  Caiaphas did not know that he was prophet, speaking out the words\r\nof truth.\r\n\r\n43  He did not know the time had come for Jesus to be offered up a\r\nsacrifice for every man, for Jew and Greek, and all the world.\r\n\r\n44  From that day forth the Jews conferred together every day, maturing\r\nplans to put the Lord to death.\r\n\r\n45  Now, Jesus and the twelve did not remain in Bethany; but in the\r\nhills of Ephriam, upon the borders of Samaria, they found a home, and\r\nthere abode for many days.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 149.\r\n\r\n    _The Jews gather in Jerusalem to attend the feast. The\r\n      Christines go to Jericho. Jesus dines with Zaccheus. He\r\n      relates the parable of the ten talents._\r\n\r\nThe great passover of the Jews, the feast of spring, was calling every\r\nloyal Jew up to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n2  Ten days before the feast the Lord and his disciples left the\r\nEphriam hills and, by the Jordan way, went down to Jericho.\r\n\r\n3  And as they entered Jericho a wealthy publican came out to see the\r\nLord; but he was small in stature and the throng was great and he\r\ncould see him not.\r\n\r\n4  A tree, a sycamore, stood by the way and he climbed up the tree and\r\nfound a seat among its boughs.\r\n\r\n5  When Jesus came, he saw the man and said, O Zaccheus, make haste,\r\ncome down; I would abide with you today.\r\n\r\n6  And Zaccheus came down and joyfully received the Lord; but many of\r\nthe stricter sect called out and said,\r\n\r\n7  For shame! he goes to lodge with Zaccheus, the sinner and the\r\npublican.\r\n\r\n8  But Jesus did not care for what they said; he went his way with\r\nZaccheus, who was a man of faith, and as they talked together Zaccheus\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n9  Lord, I have ever tried to do the right; I give unto the poor half\r\nof my goods, and if by any means I wrong a man, I right the wrong by\r\npaying him four fold.\r\n\r\n10  And Jesus said to him, Your life and faith are known to God, and\r\nlo, the benedictions of the Lord of hosts abide with you and all your\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n11  Then Jesus spoke a parable to all; he said, A vassal of an emperor\r\nwas made a king, and he went to the foreign land to claim his rights\r\nand take the kingdom to himself.\r\n\r\n12  Before he went he called ten trusted servants and to each he gave a\r\npound and said,\r\n\r\n13  Go forth and use these pounds as you have opportunity, that you may\r\ngain for me more wealth. And then he went his way.\r\n\r\n14  And after many days he came again, and called the ten, demanding a\r\nreport.\r\n\r\n15  The first one came and said, Lord, I have gained for you nine\r\npounds; you gave me one and here are ten.\r\n\r\n16  The king replied, Well done, you faithful man; because you have\r\nbeen faithful in a little thing I judge that you will be a faithful\r\nservant in a greater thing;\r\n\r\n17  Behold, I make you ruler over nine important cities of my realm.\r\n\r\n18  The second came and said, Lord, I have gained for you four pounds;\r\nyou gave me one, and here are five.\r\n\r\n19  The king replied, and you have proven up your faithfulness. Behold,\r\nI make you ruler over four important cities of my realm.\r\n\r\n20  Another came and said, Lord, I have doubled what you gave to me.\r\nYou gave one pound to me and here are two.\r\n\r\n21  The ruler said, And you have proved your faithfulness; Behold, I\r\nmake you ruler over one important city of my realm.\r\n\r\n22  Another came and said, Lord, here is what you gave to me. I knew\r\nyou were an austere man, oft reaping where you did not sow and I was\r\nsore afraid, and so I took the pound you gave to me and hid it in a\r\nsecret place; and here it is.\r\n\r\n23  The king exclaimed, You slothful man! you knew what I required,\r\nthat I expected every man to do his best.\r\n\r\n24  If you were timid and afraid to trust your judgment in the marts of\r\ntrade, why did you not go forth and put my money out for gain, that I\r\ncould have my own with interest?\r\n\r\n25  Then turning to the steward of his wealth the ruler said, Take you\r\nthis pound and give it unto him who has by diligence earned nine.\r\n\r\n26  For lo, I say, that every one who uses what he has and gains, shall\r\nhave abundantly; but he who hides away his talent in the earth shall\r\nforfeit what he has.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 150.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus heals blind Bartimæus. With the twelve he goes to\r\n      Bethany. The multitudes come to welcome him and to speak with\r\n      Lazarus._\r\n\r\nThe Christines started on their way to Bethany, and as they went,\r\nwhile yet in Jericho, they passed a beggar sitting by the way; and he\r\nwas blind Bartimæus.\r\n\r\n2  And when the beggar heard the multitude pass by he said, What is it\r\nthat I hear?\r\n\r\n3  The people said to him, Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.\r\n\r\n4  And instantly the man cried out, Lord Jesus, son of David, stay!\r\nhave mercy on poor blind Bartimæus!\r\n\r\n5  The people said to him, Be quiet; hold your peace.\r\n\r\n6  But blind Bartimæus called again, Thou son of David, hear! have\r\nmercy on poor blind Bartimæus!\r\n\r\n7  And Jesus stopped and said, Bring him to me.\r\n\r\n8  And then the people brought the blind man to the Lord, and as they\r\nbrought him up they said, Be cheerful now, Bartimæus, the Lord is\r\ncalling you.\r\n\r\n9  And then he threw his cloak aside, and ran to Jesus as he waited by\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\n10  And Jesus said, What will you have, Bartimæus?\r\n\r\n11  The blind man said, Rabboni, open up mine eyes that I may see.\r\n\r\n12  And Jesus said, Bartimæus, look up; receive your sight; your faith\r\nhas made you whole.\r\n\r\n13  And he at once received his sight, and from the fullness of his\r\nheart he said, Praise God.\r\n\r\n14  And all the people said, Praise God.\r\n\r\n15  Then Jesus and the twelve went on to Bethany. It was six days\r\nbefore the feast.\r\n\r\n16  And when the people knew that Jesus was in Bethany they came from\r\nnear and far to see him and to hear him speak.\r\n\r\n17  And they were anxious all to talk with Lazarus, whom Jesus had\r\nawakened from the dead.\r\n\r\n18  Now in Jerusalem the priests and Pharisees were all alert; they\r\nsaid, This Jesus will be at the feast, and we must not permit that he\r\nshall slip away again.\r\n\r\n19  And they commanded every man to be alert and help to apprehend the\r\nLord that they might take his life.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 151.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus teaches in the synagogue.

The Christines return\r\n      to Bethany._\r\n\r\nIt was the day before the Sabbath day, the eighth day of the Jewish\r\nNasan month, that Jesus came to Bethany.\r\n\r\n2  And on the Sabbath day he went up to the synagogue and taught.\r\n\r\n3  And on the morning of the first day of the week, the Sunday of the\r\nweek, he called his twelve apostles unto him and said,\r\n\r\n4  This day we go up to Jerusalem; be not afraid; my time has not yet\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n5  Now, two of you may go unto the village of Bethphage, and you will\r\nfind an ass tied to a tree, and you will see a little colt near by.\r\n\r\n6  Untie the ass and bring her here to me. If any one inquires why you\r\ntake the ass, just say, The master has a need of her; and then the\r\nowner will come on with you.\r\n\r\n7  And the disciples went as Jesus bade them go; they found the ass and\r\ncolt a-near an open door; and when they would untie the ass the owner\r\nsaid, Why would you take the ass away?\r\n\r\n8  And the disciples said, The master has a need of her; and then the\r\nowner said, ’Tis well.\r\n\r\n9  And then they brought the animal, and on her put their coats, and\r\nJesus sat upon the ass and rode into Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n10  And multitudes of people came and filled the way, and his disciples\r\npraised the Lord and said,\r\n\r\n11  Thrice blessed is the king who in the name of God is come! All\r\nglory be to God, and peace on earth; good will to men!\r\n\r\n12  And many spread their garments in the way, and some tore branches\r\nfrom the trees, and cast them in the way.\r\n\r\n13  And many children came with garlands of sweet flowers and placed\r\nthem on the Lord, or strewed them in the way, and said, All hail the\r\nking! Long live the king!\r\n\r\n14  The throne of David shall be built again. Hosanna to the Lord of\r\nhosts!\r\n\r\n15  Among the throng were Pharisees, who said to Jesus as he passed,\r\nRebuke this noisy throng; it is a shame for them to cry thus in the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n16  The Lord replied, I tell you, men, if these should hold their peace\r\nthe very stones would cry aloud.\r\n\r\n17  And then the Pharisees conferred among themselves; they said, Our\r\nthreats are idle words. Behold, for all the world is following him.\r\n\r\n18  As Jesus drew a-near Jerusalem he paused and wept, and said,\r\nJerusalem, Jerusalem, the holy city of the Jews! yours was the glory\r\nof the Lord; but you have cast the Lord away.\r\n\r\n19  Your eyes are closed, you cannot see the king; the kingdom of the\r\nLord of heaven and earth has come; you comprehend it not.\r\n\r\n20  Behold, the day will come when armies from afar will cast a bank\r\nabout your way; will compass you about, and hem you in on every side;\r\n\r\n21  Will dash you to the ground and slay you and your children in the\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\n22  And of your holy temple, and of your palaces and walls, they will\r\nnot leave a stone upon a stone, because today you spurn the offers of\r\nthe God of heaven.\r\n\r\n23  When Jesus and the multitude had come into Jerusalem, excitement\r\nreigned, and people asked, Who is this man?\r\n\r\n24  The multitude replied, This is the king, the prophet, priest of\r\nGod; this is the man from Galilee.\r\n\r\n25  But Jesus tarried not; he went directly to the temple porch, and it\r\nwas filled with people pressing hard to see the king.\r\n\r\n26  The sick, the halt, the lame, the blind were there, and Jesus\r\npaused, and laid his hands on them and healed them by the sacred Word.\r\n\r\n27  The temple and the temple courts were filled with children\r\npraising God. They said, Hosanna to the king! The son of David is the\r\nking! All hail the king! Praise God!\r\n\r\n28  The Pharisees were filled with anger when they heard the children\r\nsing. They said to Jesus, Hear you what the children say?\r\n\r\n29  And Jesus said, I hear; but have you never read the words of our\r\nown bard who said,\r\n\r\n30  Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise!\r\n\r\n31  And when the evening came the Lord and his disciples went again to\r\nBethany.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 152.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus rebukes a barren fig tree.

This is supposed to be the house of prayer; but it is now a\r\nden of thieves. Remove this plunder from this holy place.\r\n\r\n9  The merchants only laughed and said, We are protected in our trade\r\nby those who bear the rule; we will not go.\r\n\r\n10  Then Jesus made a scourge of cords, as he did once before, and\r\nrushed among the merchantmen, threw all their money on the floor;\r\n\r\n11  Threw wide the cages of the doves, and cut the cords that held the\r\nbleating lambs and set them free.\r\n\r\n12  And then he drove the merchants from the place, and with a clean,\r\nnew broom he swept the floors.\r\n\r\n13  Chief priests and scribes were filled with wrath, but feared to\r\ntouch or even to rebuke the Lord, for all the people stood in his\r\ndefense.\r\n\r\n14  And Jesus taught the people all day long and healed a multitude of\r\nthose diseased,\r\n\r\n15  And when the evening came he went again to Bethany.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 153.\r\n\r\n    _The Christines go to Jerusalem. They note the withered fig\r\n      tree; its symbolic meaning. Jesus teaches in the temple. Is\r\n      censured by the priests. Relates a parable of a rich man’s\r\n      feast._\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, early in the day, the master and the twelve went to\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n2  And as they went the twelve observed the tree to which the Lord had\r\ntalked the day before, and lo, the leaves were withered, just as if\r\nthey had been scorched with fire.\r\n\r\n3  And Peter said, Lord, see the tree! Its leaves are withered and the\r\ntree seems dead.\r\n\r\n4  And Jesus said, So shall it be with those who bear no fruit. When\r\nGod shall call them up to give account, lo, he will breathe upon them,\r\nand their leaves, their empty words, will wither and decay.\r\n\r\n5  God will not let the fruitless trees of life encumber ground, and he\r\nwill pluck them up and cast them all away.\r\n\r\n6  Now, you can demonstrate the power of God. Have faith in God, and\r\nyou can bid the mountains to depart, and they will crumble at your\r\nfeet;\r\n\r\n7  And you may talk to wind and wave, and they will hear, and will obey\r\nwhat you command.\r\n\r\n8  God hears the prayer of faith and when you ask in faith you shall\r\nreceive.\r\n\r\n9  You must not ask amiss; God will not hear the prayer of any man who\r\ncomes to him with blood of other men upon his hands.\r\n\r\n10  And he who harbors envious thoughts, and does not love his fellow\r\nmen, may pray forever unto God, and he will hear him not.\r\n\r\n11  God can do nothing more for men than they would do for other men.\r\n\r\n12  And Jesus walked again within the temple courts.\r\n\r\n13  The priests and scribes were much emboldened by the council of\r\nCaiaphas and the other men in power, and so they came to Jesus and\r\nthey said,\r\n\r\n14  Who gave you the authority to do as you have done? Why did you\r\ndrive the merchants from the temple yesterday?\r\n\r\n15  And Jesus answered them and said, If you will answer what I ask,\r\nthen I will answer you; Was John, the harbinger, a man of God, or was\r\nhe a seditious man?\r\n\r\n16  The scribes and Pharisees were loath to answer him; they reasoned\r\nthus among themselves:\r\n\r\n17  If we shall say, John was a prophet sent from God, then he will say,\r\n\r\n18  John testified for me, that I am son of God; why do you not believe\r\nhis words?\r\n\r\n19  If we should say, John was a bold, seditious man, the people will\r\nbe angered, for they think he was a prophet of the living God.\r\n\r\n20  And so they answered Jesus and they said, We do not know; we cannot\r\ntell.\r\n\r\n21  Then Jesus said, If you will tell me not, then I will tell you not\r\nwho gave me power to drive the robbers from the house of God.\r\n\r\n22  And then he spoke a parable to them; he said, A man once made a\r\nfeast inviting all the rich and honored people of the land.\r\n\r\n23  But when they came, they found the door into the banquet hall was\r\nlow, and they could enter not except they bowed their heads and fell\r\ndown on their knees.\r\n\r\n24  These people would not bow their heads and fall down on their\r\nknees, and so they went away; they went not to the feast.\r\n\r\n25  And then the man sent forth his messengers to bid the common folks,\r\nand those of low estate, to come and feast with him.\r\n\r\n26  These people gladly came; they bowed their heads and fell down on\r\ntheir knees, and came into the banquet hall and it was full, and every\r\none rejoiced.\r\n\r\n27  And then the master said, Behold, you priests and scribes, and\r\nPharisees! the Lord of heaven and earth has spread a sumptuous feast,\r\nand you were bidden first of all;\r\n\r\n28  But you have found the door into the banquet hall so low that you\r\nmust bow your heads and fall down on your knees to enter in, and you\r\nhave scorned the king who made the feast, refused to bow your heads\r\nand fall down on your knees, and you have gone your way;\r\n\r\n29  But now God calls again; the common folks and those of low estate\r\nhave come in multitudes, have entered in unto the feast and all\r\nrejoice.\r\n\r\n30  I tell you, men, that publicans and courtesans go through the gates\r\ninto the kingdom of the God of heaven, and you are left without.\r\n\r\n31  John came to you in righteousness; he brought the truth, but you\r\nbelieved him not.\r\n\r\n32  But publicans and courtesans believed, and were baptized and now\r\nhave entered in unto the feast.\r\n\r\n33  I tell you now, as I have told you many times, The many have been\r\ncalled, but chosen are the few.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 154.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus teaches in the temple court. The parable of the\r\n      householder and wicked husbandmen. Parable of the marriage\r\n      feast and the guest without a wedding robe._\r\n\r\nThe multitudes would hear what Jesus had to say, and so they built\r\na platform in the temple court, and Jesus stood upon the place and\r\ntaught. He spoke in parables; he said,\r\n\r\n2  A man possessed a vast estate; he planted out a vineyard, placed a\r\nhedge about it, built a tower, installed the press for making wine.\r\n\r\n3  He placed his vineyard in the hands of husbandmen and then he\r\njourneyed to a distant land.\r\n\r\n4  Now, in the vintage time the man sent forth a servant to receive and\r\nbring to him his portion of the fruitage of the vines.\r\n\r\n5  The husbandmen came forth and beat the man; laid forty lashes on his\r\nback and cast him out beyond the vineyard gate.\r\n\r\n6  And then the owner sent another man to bring to him his own. The\r\nhusbandmen laid hold of him and sorely wounded him and cast him from\r\nthe vineyard, leaving him half dead beside the way.\r\n\r\n7  The owner sent another man to bring to him his own. The husbandmen\r\nseized hold of him and with a javelin they pierced his heart; then\r\nburied him beyond the hedge.\r\n\r\n8  The owner was aggrieved. He thought within himself, What shall I do?\r\nand then he said, This will I do. My only son is here, and I will send\r\nhim to the husbandmen,\r\n\r\n9  They surely will respect my son and send me what is mine.\r\n\r\n10  He sent his son; the husbandmen took counsel with themselves; they\r\nsaid, This is the only heir to all this wealth, and if we take his\r\nlife the vast inheritance is ours.\r\n\r\n11  They took his life and cast him out beyond the vineyard hedge.\r\n\r\n12  The days will come; the owner will return to reckon with the\r\nhusbandmen, and he will seize them every one, and cast them into\r\nscorching fires where they shall stay until they pay the debts they\r\nowe.\r\n\r\n13  And he will place his vineyard in the care of honest men.\r\n\r\n14  Then turning to the priests and scribes he said, Did not your\r\nprophets say,\r\n\r\n15  The stone the builders cast away became the capstone of the arch?\r\n\r\n16  You men who pose as men of God, as husbandmen, lo, you have stoned\r\nand killed the messengers of God, his prophets and his seers, and now\r\nyou seek to slay his son.\r\n\r\n17  I tell you men, the kingdom shall be snatched away from you, and\r\nshall be given unto people who are not a people now, and to a nation\r\nthat is not a nation now.\r\n\r\n18  And men whose speech you cannot understand, will stand between the\r\nliving and the dead, and show the way to life.\r\n\r\n19  The chief priests and the Pharisees were deeply moved with anger\r\nwhen they heard this parable, and would have seized the Lord and done\r\nhim harm, but they were sore afraid; they feared the multitude.\r\n\r\n20  And Jesus spoke another parable; he said, The kingdom is alike a\r\ncertain king who made a feast in honor of the marriage of his son.\r\n\r\n21  He sent his servants forth to call the people who had been invited\r\nto the feast.\r\n\r\n22  The servants called; but then the people would not come.\r\n\r\n23  And then the king sent other messengers abroad to say, Behold, my\r\ntables now are spread; my oxen and my fatlings are prepared.\r\n\r\n24  The choicest viands and the richest wines are on my boards; come to\r\nthe marriage feast.\r\n\r\n25  The people laughed and treated with disdain his call, and went\r\ntheir way, one to his farm, another to his merchandise;\r\n\r\n26  And others seized the servants of the king; abused them shamefully;\r\nand some of them they killed.\r\n\r\n27  And then the king sent forth his soldiery who slew the murderers\r\nand burned their towns.\r\n\r\n28  And then the king sent other servants forth; to them he said, Go to\r\nthe corners of the streets, the partings of the ways, and to the marts\r\nof trade and say,\r\n\r\n29  Whoever will may come up to the marriage feast.\r\n\r\n30  The servants went their way and called; and lo, the banquet hall\r\nwas filled with guests.\r\n\r\n31  But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw a man who had\r\nnot on a wedding robe; he called to him and said,\r\n\r\n32  Friend, why are you here without a wedding robe? Would you dishonor\r\nthus my son?\r\n\r\n33  The man was dumb; he answered not.\r\n\r\n34  And then the king said to his guards, Take you this man and bind\r\nhim hand and foot and cast him out into the darkness of the night.\r\n\r\n35  The many have been called, but none are chosen to be guests who\r\nhave not clad themselves in wedding robes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 155.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus recognizes the justice of paying secular taxes. He\r\n      teaches a lesson on family relationships in the life beyond.\r\n      The greatest of the commandments is comprised in love. He\r\n      warns his disciples against the hypocrisy of scribes and\r\n      Pharisees._\r\n\r\nAs Jesus spoke, the Pharisees came up to question him; they thought to\r\ncriminate him by what he said.\r\n\r\n2  A strict Herodian spoke and said, My Lord, you are a man of truth;\r\nyou show the way to God, and you do not regard the personality of men;\r\n\r\n3  Tell us, what do you think; should we, who are the seed of Abraham,\r\npay tribute unto Cæsar? or should we not?\r\n\r\n4  And Jesus knew his wickedness of heart and said, Why do you come to\r\ntempt me thus? Show me the tribute money that you speak about.\r\n\r\n5  The man brought forth a piece of coin on which an image was engraved.\r\n\r\n6  And Jesus said, Whose image and whose name is on this coin?\r\n\r\n7  The man replied, ’Tis Cæsar’s image and his name.\r\n\r\n8  And Jesus said, Give unto Cæsar that which is Cæsar’s own; but give\r\nto God the things of God.\r\n\r\n9  And they who heard him said, He answers well.\r\n\r\n10  And then a Sadducee, who thinks there is no resurrection of the\r\ndead, came up and said, Rabboni, Moses wrote that if a married man\r\nshall die, and have no child, his widow shall become his brother’s\r\nwife.\r\n\r\n11  Now, there were seven brothers and the eldest had a wife; he died\r\nand had no child; a brother took his widow for his wife, and then he\r\ndied;\r\n\r\n12  And every brother had this woman for his wife; in course of time\r\nthe woman died;\r\n\r\n13  Now which will have this woman for a wife in the resurrection day?\r\n\r\n14  And Jesus said, Here in this plane of life men marry just to\r\ngratify their selfish selfs, or to perpetuate the race; but in the\r\nworld to come, and in the resurrection day, men do not take upon\r\nthemselves the marriage vows,\r\n\r\n15  But, like the angels and the other sons of God, they form not\r\nunions for the pleasure of the self, nor to perpetuate the race.\r\n\r\n16  Death does not mean the end of life. The grave is not the goal of\r\nmen, no more than is the earth the goal of seeds.\r\n\r\n17  Life is the consequence of death. The seed may seem to die, but\r\nfrom its grave the tree arises into life.\r\n\r\n18  So man may seem to die, but he lives on, and from the grave he\r\nsprings up into life.\r\n\r\n19  If you could comprehend the word that Moses spoke about the burning\r\nbush that burned and still was not consumed, then you would know that\r\ndeath cannot destroy the life.\r\n\r\n20  And Moses said that God is God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel.\r\n\r\n21  God is not God of dead men’s bones, but of the living man.\r\n\r\n22  I tell you, men, man goes down to the grave, but he will rise again\r\nand manifest the life;\r\n\r\n23  For every life is hid with Christ in God, and man shall live while\r\nGod shall live.\r\n\r\n24  The Pharisees and scribes who heard the Lord, exclaimed, He speaks\r\nthe truth; and they were glad to have the Sadducees discomfited.\r\n\r\n25  And then an honest scribe came forth and said to Jesus, Lord, you\r\nspeak as one whom God has sent, and may I ask,\r\n\r\n26  Which is the greatest and the first of the Commandments of the Law?\r\n\r\n27  And Jesus said, The first is: Hear O Israel, the Lord our God is\r\none; and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with\r\nall your mind, with all your soul, with all your strength;\r\n\r\n28  And you shall love your neighbor as yourself.\r\n\r\n29  These are the greatest of the ten, and on them hang the Law, the\r\nProphets and the Psalms.\r\n\r\n30  The scribe replied, My soul gives witness that you speak the truth,\r\nfor love fulfills the law, and far transcends burnt offerings and\r\nsacrifice.\r\n\r\n31  And Jesus said to him, Lo, you have solved a mystery; you are\r\nwithin the kingdom and the kingdom is in you.\r\n\r\n32  To his disciples Jesus spoke, and all the people heard; he said,\r\nBeware you of the scribes and Pharisees who pride themselves in\r\nwearing long and richly decorated robes,\r\n\r\n33  And love to be saluted in the market place, and seek the highest\r\nseats at feasts, and take the hard-earned wages of the poor to satisfy\r\ntheir carnal selves, and pray in public, long and loud.\r\n\r\n34  These are the wolves who clothe themselves to look like sheep.\r\n\r\n35  And then he said to all, The scribes and Pharisees are placed by\r\nlaw in Moses’ seat, and by the law they may interpret law;\r\n\r\n36  So what they bid you do, that do; but do not imitate their deeds.\r\n\r\n37  They say the things that Moses taught; they do the things of\r\nBeelzebul.\r\n\r\n38  They talk of mercy, yet they bind on human shoulders burdens\r\ngrievous to bear.\r\n\r\n39  They talk of helpfulness, and yet they put not forth the slightest\r\nhelpful efforts for their brother man.\r\n\r\n40  They make a show of doing things, and yet they do not anything but\r\nshow their gaudy robes, and broad phylacteries, and smile when people\r\ncall them honored masters of the law.\r\n\r\n41  They strut about and show their pride when people call them father,\r\nso and so.\r\n\r\n42  Hear, now, you men, Call no man father here. The God of heaven and\r\nearth, and he alone, is Father of the race of men.\r\n\r\n43  Christ is the hierarch, the high, exalted master of the sons of men.\r\n\r\n44  If you would be exalted, sit down at the master’s feet and serve.\r\nHe is the greatest man who serves the best.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 156.\r\n\r\n    _The scribes and Pharisees are angered. Jesus rebukes them for\r\n      their hypocrisy. He laments over Jerusalem. The widow’s mite.\r\n      Jesus delivers his farewell address to the people in the\r\n      temple._\r\n\r\nThe scribes and Pharisees were wild with rage; and Jesus said,\r\n\r\n2  Woe unto you, you scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! you stand\r\nwithin the way; you block the door; you will not go into the kingdom\r\nand you turn aside the pure in heart who are about to enter in.\r\n\r\n3  Woe unto you, you scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! you compass\r\nsea and land to make one proselyte, and when he has been made he is a\r\nson of hell, just like yourselves.\r\n\r\n4  Woe unto you who call yourselves the guides of men! and you are\r\nguides, blind guides;\r\n\r\n5  For you pay tithes of cummin, mint and dill, and leave undone the\r\nweightier matters of the law; of judgment, justice, faith.\r\n\r\n6  You filter out the gnats before you drink; but then you swallow\r\ncamels and the like.\r\n\r\n7  Woe unto you, you scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! you clean\r\nand scour the outside of the cup, while it is full of filth, extortion\r\nand excess.\r\n\r\n8  Go to and clean the inside of the cup, and then the poisonous fumes\r\nwill not defile the outside of the cup.\r\n\r\n9  Woe unto you, you scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! you\r\nare yourselves like whitewashed sepulchres; your outer garbs are\r\nbeautiful, but you are full of dead men’s bones.\r\n\r\n10  You seem to men to be divine; but in your hearts you nourish lust,\r\nhypocrisies and vile iniquities.\r\n\r\n11  Woe unto you, you scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! you build\r\nand then adorn the tombs of holy men of old and say,\r\n\r\n12  If we had lived when these men lived, we would have guarded them,\r\nwould not have acted as our fathers did, when they maltreated them and\r\nput them to the sword.\r\n\r\n13  But you are sons of them who slew the holy men, and you are not a\r\nwhit more just than they.\r\n\r\n14  Go forth and fill the measure of your fathers who were steeped in\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\n15  You are the offsprings of the vipers, and how can you be but\r\nserpents of the dust?\r\n\r\n16  God now has sent again to you his prophets and his seers, his wise\r\nmen and his holy men, and you will scourge them in your synagogues,\r\nand stone them in the streets, and nail them to the cross.\r\n\r\n17  Woe unto you! for on your heads will come the blood of all the holy\r\nmen who have been slain upon the earth,\r\n\r\n18  From righteous Abel down to Zacharias, son of Barachias, who was\r\nslain within the Holy Place before the altar of the Lord.\r\n\r\n19  Behold, I say that these things all shall come upon this nation and\r\nthe people of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n20  And Jesus looked about and said, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou cruel\r\ncity of Jerusalem, that slays the prophets in the streets and kills\r\nthe holy men whom God has sent to you!\r\n\r\n21  Lo, I would oft have gathered you as children to the fold of God;\r\nbut you would not.\r\n\r\n22  You have rejected God, and now your house is desolate, and you\r\nshall see me not again till you can say,\r\n\r\n23  Thrice blessed is the son of man who comes as son of God.\r\n\r\n24  Then Jesus went and sat beside the treasury and watched the people\r\nas they paid their tithes.\r\n\r\n25  The rich men came and gave of their abundance; and then he saw a\r\npoor but loyal widow come and put a farthing in the treasure box.\r\n\r\n26  And then he said to his disciples who were standing by, Behold, for\r\nthis poor widow who has put a farthing in the treasury has done more\r\nthan they all;\r\n\r\n27  For she has given all she had; the rich have given just a little\r\nshare of what they have.\r\n\r\n28  A company of Grecian Jews were at the feast, and they met Philip,\r\nwho could talk with them, and said, Sir, we would see the Lord, this\r\nJesus, who is called the Christ.\r\n\r\n29  And Philip led the way, and brought them to the Christ.\r\n\r\n30  And Jesus said, The hour has come; the son of man is ready to be\r\nglorified, and it cannot be otherwise.\r\n\r\n31  Except a grain of wheat fall into earth and die it can be nothing\r\nbut a grain of wheat; but if it die it lives again, and from its grave\r\na hundred grains of wheat arise.\r\n\r\n32  My soul is troubled now; What shall I say? And then he cast his\r\neyes to heaven and said,\r\n\r\n33  My Father-God, I would not ask to be relieved of all the burdens\r\nI must bear; I only ask for grace and strength to bear the burdens\r\nwhatso’er they be,\r\n\r\n34  This is the hour for which I came to earth. O Father, glorify thy\r\nname!\r\n\r\n35  And then the place was lighted with a light more brilliant than the\r\nnoonday sun; the people stood a-back; they were afraid.\r\n\r\n36  And then a voice that seemed to come from heaven said,\r\n\r\n37  I have both glorified my name and yours, and I will honor them\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n38  The people heard the voice, and some exclaimed, Behold, a distant\r\nthunder! Others said, An angel spoke to him.\r\n\r\n39  But Jesus said, This voice was not for me; it was for you, that you\r\nmight know that I am come from God.\r\n\r\n40  Now is the judgment of the world at hand; the prince of darkness\r\nshall be manifest and go unto his own.\r\n\r\n41  The son of man will now be lifted up from earth, and he will draw\r\nall men unto himself.\r\n\r\n42  The people said, The law declares that Christ abides forever more.\r\nHow can you say, The son of man will now be lifted up? Who is the son\r\nof man?\r\n\r\n43  And Jesus said to them, The light is shining now; walk in the light\r\nwhile you still have the light.\r\n\r\n44  The darkness comes; but he who walks in darkness cannot find the\r\nway.\r\n\r\n45  Again I say, Walk in the light while you still have the light, that\r\nmen may know that you are sons of light.\r\n\r\n46  And Jesus stood out in the temple porch, and made his last appeal\r\nunto the multitudes; he said,\r\n\r\n47  He who believes in me, believes in God who sent me forth to do his\r\nwill, and he who sees me now beholds my Father-God.\r\n\r\n48  Behold, I came a light unto the world; he who believes in me shall\r\nwalk in light, the light of life.\r\n\r\n49  You men who hear me now, If you believe me not, I judge you not.\r\n\r\n50  I am not come to judge the world, but I am come to save the world.\r\n\r\n51  God is the only judge of men; but what I speak will stand against\r\nyou in the day when God will judge the world;\r\n\r\n52  For from myself I do not speak; I speak the words that God has\r\ngiven me to speak.\r\n\r\n53  And then he said, Jerusalem, with all your glory and your crimes,\r\nFarewell.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 157.\r\n\r\n    _The Christines upon Mount Olives. Jesus prophecies the\r\n      destruction of Jerusalem, and of terrible disasters that will\r\n      mark the conclusion of the age. He exhorts his disciples to\r\n      faithfulness._\r\n\r\nThen Jesus with the twelve went forth and sat upon Mount Olives, just\r\nbeyond the city’s gate.\r\n\r\n2  And his disciples said, Behold the wondrous city of Jerusalem! its\r\nhomes are all so beautiful! its temples and its shrines are clothed in\r\nsuch magnificence!\r\n\r\n3  And Jesus said, The city is the glory of my people, Israel, but, lo,\r\nthe time will come when every stone will be cast down, and it will be\r\na hiss and byword for the nations of the earth.\r\n\r\n4  And the disciples asked, When will this desolation come?\r\n\r\n5  And Jesus said, This round of human life will not be full until the\r\narmies of the conqueror will thunder at her gates, and they will enter\r\nin, and blood will flow like water through the streets.\r\n\r\n6  And all the precious furnishings of temple, court and palaces will\r\nbe destroyed, or carried off to deck the palaces and courts of kings.\r\n\r\n7  Behold, these days are not at hand. Before they come, lo, you shall\r\nbe maltreated by the scribes and Pharisees, the high priests and the\r\ndoctors of the law.\r\n\r\n8  Without a cause you will be haled into the courts; you will be\r\nstoned; you will be beaten in the synagogues; will stand condemned\r\nbefore the rulers of this world, and governors and kings will sentence\r\nyou to death.\r\n\r\n9  But you will falter not, and you will testify for truth and\r\nrighteousness.\r\n\r\n10  And in these hours be anxious not about your speech; you need not\r\nthink of what to say;\r\n\r\n11  For, lo, the Holy Breath will overshadow you and give you words to\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n12  But then the carnage will go on, and men will think that they are\r\npleasing God by killing you, and nations far and near will hate you\r\nfor the sake of Christ.\r\n\r\n13  And men will stir up evil thoughts among your kin, and they will\r\nhate you and will give you up to die.\r\n\r\n14  And brothers will be false to brothers; fathers will stand forth\r\nand testify against their own, and children will drive parents to the\r\nfuneral pile.\r\n\r\n15  When you shall hear the Roman eagle screaming in the air, and see\r\nhis legions streaming o’er the plain, then know the desolation of\r\nJerusalem is near.\r\n\r\n16  Then let the wise wait not, but flee. Let him who is upon his house\r\nwait not to enter in the house to gather up his wealth, but let him\r\nflee.\r\n\r\n17  And he who labors in the field must not return, but leave his all\r\nto save his life.\r\n\r\n18  And woe to mothers with their little children in that day; none\r\nshall escape the sword.\r\n\r\n19  The tribulation of these days cannot be told in words, for such has\r\nnever been since God created man upon the earth.\r\n\r\n20  The conqueror will carry many of the sons of Abraham away as\r\ncaptives into foreign lands, and they who know not Israel’s God will\r\ntread the highways of Jerusalem until the anti-Jewish times have been\r\nfulfilled.\r\n\r\n21  But when the people have been punished for their crimes, the\r\ntribulation days will end; but lo, the time will come when all the\r\nworld will rise, like gladiators in a ring, and fight just for the\r\nsake of shedding blood.\r\n\r\n22  And men will reason not; they will not see, nor care to see a cause\r\nfor carnage, desolation, thefts; for they will war with friend or foe.\r\n\r\n23  The very air will seem surcharged with smoke of death; and\r\npestilence will follow close upon the sword.\r\n\r\n24  And signs that men have never seen will then appear in heaven and\r\nearth; in sun, and moon, and stars.\r\n\r\n25  The seas will roar, and sounds will come from heaven that men\r\ncan never comprehend, and these will bring distress of nations with\r\nperplexity.\r\n\r\n26  Hearts of the strongest men will faint in fear, in expectation of\r\nthe coming of more frightful things upon the earth.\r\n\r\n27  But while the conflicts rage on land and sea, the Prince of Peace\r\nwill stand above the clouds of heaven and say again:\r\n\r\n28  Peace, peace on earth; good will to men; and every man will throw\r\naway his sword, and nations will learn war no more.\r\n\r\n29  And then the man who bears the pitcher will walk forth across an\r\narc of heaven; the sign and signet of the son of man will stand forth\r\nin the eastern sky.\r\n\r\n30  The wise will then lift up their heads and know that the redemption\r\nof the earth is near.\r\n\r\n31  Before these days shall come, behold, false Christs and poor\r\ndeluded prophets will arise in many lands.\r\n\r\n32  And they will show forth signs, and do a multitude of mighty works;\r\nand they will lead astray the many who are not wise; and many of the\r\nwise will be deceived.\r\n\r\n33  And now I tell you once again, When men shall say, The Christ is in\r\nthe wilderness, go you not forth.\r\n\r\n34  And if they say, The Christ is in the secret place, believe it not;\r\nfor when he comes the world will know that he has come.\r\n\r\n35  For as the morning light comes from the east and shines unto the\r\nwest; so shall be the coming of the age and son of man.\r\n\r\n36  The wicked of the earth will weep when they shall see the son of\r\nman come down upon the clouds of heaven, in power.\r\n\r\n37  Take heed you, O take heed, for you know not the hour nor the day\r\nwhen comes the son of man.\r\n\r\n38  Let not your hearts be overcharged with sensuous things, nor with\r\nthe cares of life, lest that day come and find you unprepared.\r\n\r\n39  Keep watch at every season of the year; and pray that you may meet\r\nthe Lord with joy and not with grief.\r\n\r\n40  Before these days shall come our Father-God will send his\r\nmessengers abroad, yea, to the corners of the earth, and they will say,\r\n\r\n41  Prepare you, O prepare; the Prince of Peace shall come, and now is\r\ncoming on the clouds of heaven.\r\n\r\n42  When Jesus had thus said, he went with his disciples back to\r\nBethany.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 158.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus and the twelve at prayer in Olivet. Jesus reveals to his\r\n      disciples the deeper meanings of secret doctrines. He tells\r\n      them what to teach the people. Relates a number of parables.\r\n      They return to Bethany._\r\n\r\nThe morning of the Wednesday of the week was come, and Jesus with the\r\ntwelve went out to Olivet to pray; and they were lost in prayer for\r\nseven hours.\r\n\r\n2  Then Jesus called the twelve close to his side and said, This day\r\nthe curtain parts and we will step beyond the veil into the secret\r\ncourts of God.\r\n\r\n3  And Jesus opened up to them the meaning of the hidden way, and of\r\nthe Holy Breath, and of the light that cannot fail.\r\n\r\n4  He told them all about the Book of Life, the Rolls of Graphael, the\r\nBook of God’s Remembrance where all the thoughts and words of men are\r\nwritten down.\r\n\r\n5  He did not speak aloud to them; he told the secrets of the masters\r\nin an undertone, and when he spoke the name of God there was a silence\r\nin the courts of heaven for half an hour, for angels spoke with bated\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n6  And Jesus said, These things may not be spoken out aloud; they never\r\nmay be written down; they are the messages of Silenceland; they are\r\nthe Breathings of the inner heart of God.\r\n\r\n7  And then the master taught the twelve the lessons they should teach\r\nto other men. He sometimes taught in parables; he said,\r\n\r\n8  You call to mind the words of yesterday about the coming of the son\r\nof man. Now, you shall teach to other men what I have spoken and am\r\nspeaking unto you;\r\n\r\n9  Teach them to pray and not to faint; to be prepared at every moment\r\nof the day, for when they least expect him, then the Lord will come.\r\n\r\n10  A man went to a distant land and left his house and all his wealth\r\nin care of servants; five to guard his house and five to guard his\r\nbarns and herds.\r\n\r\n11  The servants waited long for his return, but he came not, and they\r\ngrew careless in their work; some spent their time in revelings and\r\ndrunkenness, and some slept at their posts.\r\n\r\n12  And night by night the robbers came and carried off the wealth from\r\nhouse and barn, and drove away the choicest of the herds.\r\n\r\n13  And when they knew that much of all the wealth that they were left\r\nto guard had been purloined, they said,\r\n\r\n14  We cannot be to blame; if we had known the day and hour when our\r\nlord would come again we would have guarded well his wealth, and\r\nsuffered not the thieves to carry it away; he surely is at fault\r\nbecause he told us not.\r\n\r\n15  But after many days the lord returned, and when he knew that\r\nthieves had robbed him of his wealth, he called his servants and he\r\nsaid to them,\r\n\r\n16  Because you have neglected what was given you to do, have spent\r\nyour time in revelings and sleep, behold you all are debtors unto me.\r\n\r\n17  What I have lost by your neglect, you owe to me. And then he gave\r\nthem heavy tasks to do, and bound them to their posts with chains,\r\nwhere they remained till they had paid for all the goods their lord\r\nhad lost through their neglect.\r\n\r\n18  Another man locked up his wealth and went to sleep, and in the\r\nnight time robbers came, unlocked his doors, and when they saw no\r\nguard, they entered in and carried off his wealth.\r\n\r\n19  And when the man awoke and found his doors ajar and all his\r\ntreasures gone, he said, If I had known the hour when the thieves\r\nwould come I would have been on guard.\r\n\r\n20  Beware, my friends, beware! and be prepared at every hour, and if\r\nyour Lord shall come at midnight or at dawn, it matters not, for he\r\nwill find you ready to receive.\r\n\r\n21  And then, behold, a marriage was announced, and virgins, ten of\r\nthem, were set apart to meet the bridegroom when he came.\r\n\r\n22  The virgins clothed themselves in proper garbs, and took their\r\nlamps and sat in waiting for the watch to say, Behold, the bridegroom\r\ncomes!\r\n\r\n23  Now, five were wise; they filled their lamps with oil; and five\r\nwere foolish, for they carried empty lamps.\r\n\r\n24  The groom came not at the expected time; the virgins were a-weary\r\nwith their watch and slept.\r\n\r\n25  At midnight came the cry, Behold, the bridegroom comes!\r\n\r\n26  The virgins rose; the wise ones quickly trimmed their lamps and\r\nwent forth ready to receive the groom.\r\n\r\n27  The foolish virgins said, We have no oil, our lamps burn not.\r\n\r\n28  They sought to borrow from the wise, who said, We have no oil to\r\nspare; Go to the merchantmen and buy and fill your lamps and then come\r\nforth to meet the groom.\r\n\r\n29  But while they went to purchase oil, the bridegroom came; the\r\nvirgins who were ready with their lamps all trimmed went with him to\r\nthe marriage feast.\r\n\r\n30  And when the foolish virgins came the door was shut, and though\r\nthey knocked and called aloud, the door was opened not.\r\n\r\n31  The master of the feast exclaimed, I know you not! and in disgrace\r\nthe virgins went their way.\r\n\r\n32  Again I say to you, and you shall say to them who follow you,\r\n\r\n33  Be ready every moment of the day and night, because when you expect\r\nhim not, the Lord will come.\r\n\r\n34  Behold, when he will come with all his messengers of light, the\r\nBook of Life, and that of Records, shall be opened up--the books in\r\nwhich the thoughts and words and deeds are written down.\r\n\r\n35  And every one can read the records he has written for himself, and\r\nhe will know his doom before the judge shall speak, and this will be\r\nthe sifting time.\r\n\r\n36  According to their records men will find their own.\r\n\r\n37  The judge is Righteousness, the king of all the earth, and he will\r\nseparate the multitudes as shepherds separate the sheep and goats.\r\n\r\n38  The sheep will find their places on the right, the goats upon the\r\nleft, and every man will know his place.\r\n\r\n39  And then the judge will say, to those upon the right, You blessed\r\nof the Father-God, come unto your inheritance, which was prepared for\r\nyou from times of old.\r\n\r\n40  You have been servants of the race; and I was hungry and you gave\r\nme bread; was thirsty and you gave me drink; was naked and you gave me\r\nclothes;\r\n\r\n41  Was sick, you ministered to me; and was in prison and you came to\r\nme with words of cheer; I was a stranger and in your homes I found a\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n42  Then will the righteous say, When did we see you hungry, thirsty,\r\nsick, imprisoned or a stranger at our gates and ministered to you?\r\n\r\n43  And then the judge will say, You served the sons of men, and\r\nwhatsoever you have done for these, that you have done for me.\r\n\r\n44  The judge will say to those upon the left, Depart from me; you have\r\nnot served the sons of men.\r\n\r\n45  I was hungry and you gave me naught to eat; was thirsty and you\r\ngave me naught to drink; I was a stranger and you drove me from your\r\ndoor; I was imprisoned and was sick, you did not minister to me.\r\n\r\n46  Then these will say, When did we thus neglect to care for you? When\r\ndid we see you hungry, thirsty, sick, a stranger or in prison and did\r\nnot minister to you?\r\n\r\n47  And then the judge will say, Your life was full of self; you served\r\nthe self and not your fellow man, and when you slighted one of these,\r\nyou slighted and neglected me.\r\n\r\n48  Then will the righteous have the kingdom and the power, and they\r\nwho are unrighteous shall go forth to pay their debts, to suffer all\r\nthat men have suffered at their hands.\r\n\r\n49  They who have ears to hear and hearts to understand will comprehend\r\nthese parables.\r\n\r\n50  When he had finished all these parables he said, You know that in\r\ntwo days the great passover feast will come, and lo, the son of man\r\nwill be betrayed into the hands of wicked men.\r\n\r\n51  And he will give his life upon the cross, and men will know that\r\nhe, the son of man, is son of God.\r\n\r\n52  Then Jesus and the twelve returned to Bethany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XVIII.\r\n\r\nTZADDI.\r\n\r\n_The Arrest and Betrayal of Jesus._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 159.\r\n\r\n    _The Christines attend a feast in Simon’s house. Mary anoints\r\n      the master with a costly balm, and Judas and others rebuked\r\n      her for profligacy. Jesus defends her. The rulers of the Jews\r\n      employ Ananias to arrest Jesus. Ananias bribes Judas to aid\r\n      him._\r\n\r\nBar-Simon, who was once a leper and was cleansed by Jesus by the\r\nsacred Word, abode in Bethany.\r\n\r\n2  In honor of the Christine Lord he gave a feast, and Lazarus was\r\namong the guests, and Ruth and Martha served.\r\n\r\n3  And as the guests reclined about the table, Mary took a cruse of\r\nrich perfume and poured it out on Jesus’ head and feet.\r\n\r\n4  And then she knelt and with her hair she wiped his feet; the odor of\r\nthe rich perfume filled all the room.\r\n\r\n5  Now, Judas, always looking at the selfish side of life, exclaimed,\r\nFor shame! why did you waste that costly perfume thus?\r\n\r\n6  We might have sold it for three hundred pence, and had the money to\r\nsupply our wants and feed the poor.\r\n\r\n7  (Now, Judas was the treasurer, and carried all the money of the\r\nChristine band.)\r\n\r\n8  And others said, Why, Mary, what a profligate you are! you should\r\nnot throw such wealth away.\r\n\r\n9  But Jesus said, You men, be still; let her alone; you know not what\r\nyou say.\r\n\r\n10  The poor are with you constantly; at any time you can administer to\r\nthem; but I will not be with you long.\r\n\r\n11  And Mary knows the sadness of the coming days; she has anointed me\r\nbeforehand for my burial.\r\n\r\n12  The gospel of the Christ will everywhere be preached, and he who\r\ntells the story of the Christ will tell about this day; and what was\r\ndone by Mary at this hour will be a sweet memorial to her wherever men\r\nabide.\r\n\r\n13  And when the feast was over Jesus went with Lazarus to his home.\r\n\r\n14  Now, in Jerusalem the priests and Pharisees were busy with their\r\nplans to seize the Lord and take his life.\r\n\r\n15  The high priest called in counsel all the wisest men and said, This\r\ndeed must be accomplished in a secret way.\r\n\r\n16  He must be taken when the multitudes are not a-near, else we may\r\ncause a war; the common people may stand forth in his defense and thus\r\npollute this sacred place with human blood.\r\n\r\n17  And what we do, that we must do before the great day of the feast.\r\n\r\n18  And Ananias said, I have a plan that will succeed. The twelve with\r\nJesus every day go forth alone to pray;\r\n\r\n19  And we will find their trysting place; then we can seize the man\r\nand bring him here without the knowledge of the multitudes.\r\n\r\n20  I know one of the twelve, a man who worships wealth, and for a sum\r\nI think that he will lead the way to where the man is wont to pray.\r\n\r\n21  And then Caiaphas said, If you will lead the way and bribe the man\r\nof whom you speak, to aid in seizing Jesus in a secret place, then we\r\nwill give to you a hundred silver pieces for your hire.\r\n\r\n22  And Ananias said, ’Tis well.\r\n\r\n23  And then he went to Bethany and found the twelve at Simon’s house,\r\nand calling Judas to the side he said,\r\n\r\n24  If you would care to make a sum of money for yourself hear me:\r\n\r\n25  The high priest and the other rulers in Jerusalem would like to\r\ntalk with Jesus when alone, that they may know about his claims;\r\n\r\n26  And if he proves himself to be the Christ, lo, they will stand in\r\nhis defense.\r\n\r\n27  Now, if you will but lead the way to where your master is tomorrow\r\nnight that they may send a priest to talk with him alone, there is a\r\nsum of silver, thirty pieces, that the priests will give to you.\r\n\r\n28  And Judas reasoned with himself; he said, It surely may be well to\r\ngive the Lord a chance to tell the priests about his claims when he is\r\nall alone.\r\n\r\n29  And if the priests would do him harm he has the power to disappear\r\nand go his way as he has done before; and thirty pieces is a goodly\r\nsum.\r\n\r\n30  And so he said to Ananias, I will lead the way, and by a kiss make\r\nknown which person is the Lord.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 160.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus and the twelve eat the passover alone in Nicodemus’\r\n      house. Jesus washes the disciples’ feet. Judas leaves the\r\n      table and goes forth to betray the Lord. Jesus teaches the\r\n      eleven. He institutes the Lord’s supper._\r\n\r\nOn Thursday morning Jesus called to him the twelve disciples, and\r\nhe said to them, This is God’s remembrance day, and we will eat the\r\npascal supper all alone.\r\n\r\n2  And then he said to Peter, James and John, Go now into Jerusalem and\r\nthere prepare the pasch.\r\n\r\n3  And the disciples said, Where would you have us go to find the place\r\nwhere we may have the feast prepared?\r\n\r\n4  And Jesus said, Go by the fountain gate and you will see a man who\r\nhas a pitcher in his hand. Speak unto him and say: This is the first\r\nday of unleavened bread;\r\n\r\n5  The Lord would have you set apart your banquet hall where he may eat\r\nhis last passover with the twelve.\r\n\r\n6  Fear not to speak; the man whom you will see is Nicodemus, a ruler\r\nof the Jews, and yet a man of God.\r\n\r\n7  And the disciples went and found the man as Jesus said, and\r\nNicodemus hastened to his home; the banquet hall, an upper room, was\r\nset apart, the supper was prepared.\r\n\r\n8  Now, in the afternoon the Lord and his disciples went up to\r\nJerusalem and found the feast in readiness.\r\n\r\n9  And when the hour had come to eat the feast, the twelve began to\r\nstrive among themselves, each anxious to secure the honored seats.\r\n\r\n10  And Jesus said, My friends, would you contend for self just as the\r\nshadows of this night of gloom comes on?\r\n\r\n11  There is no honored seat at heaven’s feast except for him who\r\nhumbly takes the lowest seat.\r\n\r\n12  And then the Lord arose and took a basin full of water and a towel,\r\nand bowing down, he washed the feet of all the twelve and dried them\r\nwith the towel.\r\n\r\n13  He breathed upon them and he said, And may these feet walk in the\r\nways of righteousness forevermore.\r\n\r\n14  He came to Peter and was about to wash his feet, and Peter said,\r\nLord, would you wash my feet?\r\n\r\n15  And Jesus said, You do not comprehend the meaning of the thing I\r\ndo, but you will comprehend.\r\n\r\n16  And Peter said, My master, no, you shall not stoop to wash my feet.\r\n\r\n17  And Jesus said, My friend, if I wash not your feet you have no part\r\nwith me.\r\n\r\n18  And Peter said, Then, O my Lord, wash both my feet, my hands, my\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n19  And Jesus said to him, He who has taken first his bath is clean,\r\nand has no need to wash, except his feet.\r\n\r\n20  The feet are truly symbols of the understanding of the man, and he\r\nwho would be clean must, in the living stream of life, wash well his\r\nunderstanding every day.\r\n\r\n21  Then Jesus sat with his disciples at the table of the feast and\r\nsaid, Behold the lesson of the hour:\r\n\r\n22  You call me master; such I am. If, then, your Lord and master kneel\r\nand wash your feet, should you not wash each other’s feet and thus\r\nshow forth your willingness to serve?\r\n\r\n23  You know these things, and if you do them, blessed thrice are you.\r\n\r\n24  And then he said, This is an hour when I can truly praise the name\r\nof God, for I have greatly wished to eat with you this feast before I\r\npass the veil;\r\n\r\n25  For I will eat it not again until anew I eat it with you in the\r\nkingdom of our Father-God.\r\n\r\n26  And then they sung the Hebrew song of praise that Jews were wont to\r\nsing before the feast.\r\n\r\n27  And then they ate the pasch and as they ate, the master said,\r\nBehold, for one of you will turn away this night and will betray me\r\ninto wicked hands.\r\n\r\n28  And the disciples were amazed at what he said; they looked into\r\neach other’s face in wonderment; they all exclaimed, Lord, is it I?\r\n\r\n29  And Peter said to John, who sat beside the Lord, To whom does he\r\nrefer?\r\n\r\n30  And John put forth his hand and touched the master’s hand and said,\r\nWhich one of us is so depraved as to betray his Lord?\r\n\r\n31  And Judas said, Lord, is it I?\r\n\r\n32  And Jesus said, He is the one who now has put his hand with mine\r\ninto the dish. They looked, and Judas’ hand was with the hand of Jesus\r\nin the dish.\r\n\r\n33  And Jesus said, The prophets cannot fail; the son of man must be\r\nbetrayed, but woe to him who shall betray his Lord.\r\n\r\n34  And from the table Judas rose at once; his hour had come.\r\n\r\n35  And Jesus said to him, Do quickly what you are to do. And Judas\r\nwent his way.\r\n\r\n36  And when the pasch was done the Lord with the eleven sat a while in\r\nsilent thought.\r\n\r\n37  Then Jesus took a loaf of bread that had been broken not and said,\r\nThis loaf is symbol of my body, and the bread is symbol of the bread\r\nof life;\r\n\r\n38  And as I break this loaf, so shall my flesh be broken as a pattern\r\nfor the sons of men; for men must freely give their bodies up in\r\nwilling sacrifice for other men.\r\n\r\n39  And as you eat this bread, so shall you eat the bread of life, and\r\nnever die. And then he gave to each a piece of bread to eat.\r\n\r\n40  And then he took a cup of wine and said, Blood is the life; this is\r\nthe life-blood of the grape; it is the symbol of the life of him who\r\ngives his life for men.\r\n\r\n41  And as you drink this wine, if you shall drink in faith, you drink\r\nthe life of Christ.\r\n\r\n42  And then he supped and passed the cup, and the disciples supped;\r\nand Jesus said, This is the feast of life, the great passover of the\r\nson of man, the Supper of the Lord, and you shall often eat the bread\r\nand drink the wine.\r\n\r\n43  From henceforth shall this bread be called Remembrance bread; this\r\nwine shall be Remembrance wine; and when you eat this bread and drink\r\nthis wine remember me.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 161.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus teaches the eleven. Tells them that they will all be\r\n      estranged from him, and that Peter will deny him thrice\r\n      before the morning. He speaks final words of encouragement.\r\n      Promises the Comforter._\r\n\r\nNow, after Judas had gone forth to meet the emissaries of the priests\r\nand to betray his Lord,\r\n\r\n2  The master said, The hour has come, the son of man will now be\r\nglorified.\r\n\r\n3  My little children, I am with you yet a little while; soon you will\r\nseek me and will find me not, for where I go you cannot come.\r\n\r\n4  I give to you a new command: As I love you and give my life for you,\r\nso shall you love the world, and give your life to save the world.\r\n\r\n5  Love one another as you love yourselves, and then the world will\r\nknow that you are sons of God, disciples of the son of man whom God\r\nhas glorified.\r\n\r\n6  And Peter said, Lord, where you go there I will go, for I would lay\r\nmy life down for my Lord.\r\n\r\n7  And Jesus said, Boast not of bravery, my friend; you are not strong\r\nenough tonight to follow me.\r\n\r\n8  Now, Peter, hear! you will deny me thrice before the cock shall crow\r\ntomorrow morn.\r\n\r\n9  And then he looked upon the eleven and said, You all will be\r\nestranged from me this night.\r\n\r\n10  The prophet said, Lo, he will smite the shepherd of the sheep; the\r\nsheep will flee and hide away.\r\n\r\n11  But after I am risen from the dead, lo, you will come again, and I\r\nwill go before you into Galilee.\r\n\r\n12  And Peter said, My Lord, though every other man forsake you I will\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n13  And Jesus said, O Simon Peter, lo, your zeal is greater than your\r\nfortitude! Behold, for Satan cometh up to sift you as a pan of wheat,\r\nbut I have prayed that in your faith you shall not fail; that after\r\ntrial you may stand a tower of strength.\r\n\r\n14  And the disciples all exclaimed, There is no power on earth that\r\ncan estrange, or cause us to deny our Lord.\r\n\r\n15  And Jesus said, Let not your hearts be sad; you all believe in God;\r\nbelieve in me.\r\n\r\n16  Behold, for there are many mansions in my Fatherland. If there were\r\nnot I would have told you so.\r\n\r\n17  I go unto my Fatherland, and will prepare a place for you that\r\nwhere I am there you may be. But now you do not know the way unto my\r\nFatherland.\r\n\r\n18  And Thomas said, We do not know where you intend to go; how could\r\nwe know the way?\r\n\r\n19  And Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, the life; I manifest the\r\nChrist of God. No man can reach my Fatherland except he comes with me\r\nthrough Christ.\r\n\r\n20  If you had known and comprehended me, then you would know my\r\nFather-God.\r\n\r\n21  And Philip said, Show us the Father and we will be satisfied.\r\n\r\n22  And Jesus said, Have I been with you all these years and still you\r\nknow me not?\r\n\r\n23  He who has seen the son has seen the Father, for in the son the\r\nFather has revealed himself.\r\n\r\n24  Lo, I have told you many times that what I speak and what I do are\r\nnot the words and works of man;\r\n\r\n25  They are the words and works of God, who lives in me and I in him.\r\n\r\n26  Hear me, you faithful men: He who believes in me and in my\r\nFather-God shall say and do what I have said and done.\r\n\r\n27  Yea, more, he shall do greater works than I have ever done, because\r\nI go to him whose works we do, and then I can reach forth my hand in\r\nhelpfulness.\r\n\r\n28  And in my name, through Christ, you may petition God and he will\r\ngrant you your request.\r\n\r\n29  Do you believe what I have said? Yes, you believe, and if you love\r\nthe Christ and follow me then you will keep my words.\r\n\r\n30  I am the vine; you are the branches of the vine; my Father is the\r\nhusbandman,\r\n\r\n31  The branches that are worthless, bearing naught but leaves, the\r\nhusbandman will cut away and cast into the fire to be burned.\r\n\r\n32  And he will prune the branches that bear fruit that they may yield\r\nabundantly.\r\n\r\n33  The branch cannot bear fruit if separated from the vine; and you\r\ncannot bear fruit when separate from me.\r\n\r\n34  Abide in me, and do the works that God, through me, has taught you\r\nhow to do, and you will bear much fruit, and God will honor you as he\r\nhas honored me.\r\n\r\n35  And now I go my way, but I will pray my Father-God and he will send\r\nanother Comforter to you, who will abide with you.\r\n\r\n36  Behold, this Comforter of God, the Holy Breath, is one with God,\r\nbut she is one the world cannot receive because it sees her not; it\r\nknows her not.\r\n\r\n37  But you know her, and will know her, because she will abide within\r\nyour soul.\r\n\r\n38  I will not leave you desolate, but in the Christ, which is the love\r\nof God made manifest to men, I will be with you all the way.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 162.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus reveals more fully the mission of the Holy Breath. Tells\r\n      his disciples plainly that he is about to die, and they are\r\n      sad. He prays for them and all the world of believers. They\r\n      leave the banquet hall._\r\n\r\nNow, John was deeply grieved because the master said, I go away, and\r\nwhere I go you cannot come.\r\n\r\n2  He wept and said, Lord, I would go with you through every trial and\r\nto death.\r\n\r\n3  And Jesus said, And you shall follow me through trials and through\r\ndeath; but now you cannot go where I will go; but you shall come.\r\n\r\n4  And Jesus spoke again unto the eleven and said, Grieve not because\r\nI go away, for it is best that I should go away. If I go not the\r\nComforter will not come to you.\r\n\r\n5  These things I speak while with you in the flesh, but when the Holy\r\nBreath shall come in power, lo, she will teach you more and more, and\r\nbring to your remembrance all the words that I have said to you.\r\n\r\n6  There are a multitude of things yet to be said; things that this age\r\ncannot receive, because it cannot comprehend.\r\n\r\n7  But, lo, I say, Before the great day of the Lord shall come, the\r\nHoly Breath will make all mysteries known--\r\n\r\n8  The mysteries of the soul, of life, of death, of immortality; the\r\noneness of a man with every other man and with his God.\r\n\r\n9  Then will the world be led to truth, and man will be the truth.\r\n\r\n10  When she has come, the Comforter, she will convince the world of\r\nsin, and of the truth of what I speak, and of the rightness of the\r\njudgment of the just; and then the prince of carnal life will be cast\r\nout.\r\n\r\n11  And when the Comforter shall come I need not intercede for you; for\r\nyou will stand approved, and God will know you then as he knows me.\r\n\r\n12  The hour has come when you will weep; the wicked will rejoice,\r\nbecause I go away; but I will come again, and all your sorrows shall\r\nbe turned to joy;\r\n\r\n13  Yea, verily, you will rejoice as one who welcomes back a brother\r\nfrom the dead.\r\n\r\n14  And the disciples said, Our Lord, speak not in proverbs any more;\r\nspeak plainly unto us; we know that you are wise and know all things.\r\n\r\n15  What is the meaning of your words, I go away, but I will come again?\r\n\r\n16  And Jesus said, The hour is come when you will all be scattered\r\nforth, and every man will be afraid;\r\n\r\n17  Will flee to save his life and leave me all alone; yet I will not\r\nbe all alone; my Father-God is with me all the way.\r\n\r\n18  And wicked men will take me to the judgment seat of wicked men, and\r\nin the presence of the multitudes I will give up my life, a pattern\r\nfor the sons of men.\r\n\r\n19  But I will rise again and come to you.\r\n\r\n20  These things I speak that you may be established in the faith when\r\nthey shall come to pass.\r\n\r\n21  And you shall bear the buffetings of men, and follow in the thorny\r\npath I tread.\r\n\r\n22  Be not dismayed; be of good cheer. Lo, I have overcome the world,\r\nand you shall overcome the world.\r\n\r\n23  Then Jesus lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, My Father-God,\r\nthe hour has come;\r\n\r\n24  The son of man must now be lifted from the earth, and may he falter\r\nnot, that all the world may know the power of sacrifice;\r\n\r\n25  For as I give my life for men, lo, men must give their lives for\r\nother men.\r\n\r\n26  I came to do thy will, O God, and in the sacred name, the Christ is\r\nglorified, that men may see the Christ as life, as light, as love, as\r\ntruth,\r\n\r\n27  And through the Christ become themselves the life, the light, the\r\nlove, the truth.\r\n\r\n28  I praise thy name because of these whom thou hast given me, for\r\nthey have honored thee and they will honor thee;\r\n\r\n29  And none of them are lost, and none are gone away, except the\r\nblinded son of carnal life, who hath gone forth to sell his Lord.\r\n\r\n30  O God, forgive this man, because he knows not what he does.\r\n\r\n31  And now, O God, I come to thee, and am no more in mortal life; keep\r\nthou these men to whom I have made known thy wisdom and thy love.\r\n\r\n32  As they believe in me, and in the words I speak, may all the world\r\nbelieve in them and in the words they speak.\r\n\r\n33  As thou hast sent me forth into the world, so I have sent them\r\nforth. I pray that thou wouldst honor them as thou hast honored me.\r\n\r\n34  I do not pray that thou wouldst take them from the world, but that\r\nthey may be guarded from the evil of the world, and not be subject to\r\ntemptations that are too great for them to bear.\r\n\r\n35  They once were of the world, but now are of the world no more, as I\r\nam of the world no more.\r\n\r\n36  Thy word is truth, O God, and by thy word let them be sanctified.\r\n\r\n37  I do not pray for these alone, O God; I also pray for all who will\r\nbelieve on me, and will accept the Christ because of what they do and\r\nsay, that they may all be one.\r\n\r\n38  As I am one with thee, and thou art one with me, may they be one\r\nwith us,\r\n\r\n39  That all the world may know that thou hast sent me forth to do thy\r\nwill, and that thou lovest them as thou hast ever loved me.\r\n\r\n40  When Jesus had thus said, they sung the Jewish song of praise, and\r\nthen arose and went their way.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 163.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus visits Pilate, who urges him to flee from the country to\r\n      save his life. Jesus refuses to do so. He meets his disciples\r\n      in Massalian’s orchard. The scene in Gethsemane. The Jewish\r\n      mob led by Judas appears._\r\n\r\nAs Jesus and the eleven went out, a Roman guard approached and said,\r\nAll hail! Is one of you the man from Galilee?\r\n\r\n2  And Peter said, We all are men from Galilee; whom do you seek?\r\n\r\n3  The guard replied, I seek for Jesus, who is called the Christ.\r\n\r\n4  And Jesus answered, Here am I.\r\n\r\n5  The guard spoke out and said, I do not come in an official way; I\r\nbear to you a message from the governor.\r\n\r\n6  Jerusalem is all alive with vengeful Jews who swear that they will\r\ntake your life, and Pilate would confer with you, and he would have\r\nyou come to him without delay.\r\n\r\n7  And Jesus said to Peter and the rest, Go to the vale, and by the\r\nKidron wait for me, and I will go alone and see the governor.\r\n\r\n8  And Jesus went up with the guard, and when he reached the palace,\r\nPilate met him at the gate and said,\r\n\r\n9  Young man, I have a word to say that may be well for you. I have\r\nobserved your works and words three years and more;\r\n\r\n10  And I have often stood in your defense when your own countrymen\r\nwould fain have stoned you as a criminal.\r\n\r\n11  But now the priests, the scribes and Pharisees have stirred the\r\ncommon people to a stage of frenzied wantonness and cruelty, and they\r\nintend to take your life,\r\n\r\n12  Because, they say, that you have sworn to tear their temple down;\r\nto change the laws that Moses gave; to exile Pharisee and priest and\r\nseat yourself upon a throne.\r\n\r\n13  And they aver that you are full in league with Rome.\r\n\r\n14  The streets of all Jerusalem are filled this moment with a horde of\r\nmadmen all intent to shed your blood.\r\n\r\n15  There is no safety for you but in flight; wait not until the\r\nmorning sun. You know the way to reach the border of this cursed land.\r\n\r\n16  I have a little band of guards, well horsed and armed, and they\r\nwill take you out beyond the reach of harm.\r\n\r\n17  You must not tarry here, young man, you must arise and go.\r\n\r\n18  And Jesus said, A noble prince has Cæsar in his Pilate Pontius, and\r\nfrom the point of carnal man your words are seasoned with the wise\r\nman’s salt; but from the point of Christ your words are foolishness.\r\n\r\n19  The coward flees when danger comes; but he who comes to seek and\r\nsave the lost must give his life in willing sacrifice for those he\r\ncomes to seek and save.\r\n\r\n20  Before the pasch has been consumed, lo, all this nation will be\r\ncursed by shedding blood of innocence; and even now the murderers are\r\nat the door.\r\n\r\n21  And Pilate said, It shall not be; the sword of Rome will be\r\nunsheathed to save your life.\r\n\r\n22  And Jesus said, Nay, Pilate, nay; there are no armies large enough\r\nin all the world to save my life.\r\n\r\n23  And Jesus bade the governor farewell, and went his way; but Pilate\r\nsent a double guard with him lest he should fall into the hands of\r\nthose who were alert to take his life.\r\n\r\n24  But in a moment Jesus disappeared; the guards saw him no more, and\r\nin a little while he reached the brook of Kidron where the eleven were.\r\n\r\n25  Now, just beyond the brook there was an orchard and a home where\r\none, Massalian, lived, where Jesus oft had been.\r\n\r\n26  Massalian was his friend, and he believed that Jesus was the Christ\r\nthat Jewish prophets long ago had said would come.\r\n\r\n27  Now, in the orchard was a sacred knoll; Massalian called the place\r\nGethsemane.\r\n\r\n28  The night was dark, but in the orchard it was doubly dark and Jesus\r\nbade the eight disciples tarry by the brook,\r\n\r\n29  While he, with Peter, James and John went to Gethsemane to pray.\r\n\r\n30  They sat beneath an olive tree, and Jesus opened up the mysteries\r\nof life to Peter, James and John. He said,\r\n\r\n31  The Spirit of eternity is One unmanifest; and this is God the\r\nFather, God the Mother, God the Son in One.\r\n\r\n32  In life of manifests the One became the Three, and God the Father\r\nis the God of might; and God the Mother is omniscient God, and God the\r\nSon is love.\r\n\r\n33  And God the Father is the power of heaven and earth; and God the\r\nMother is the Holy Breath, the thought of heaven and earth; and God\r\nthe Son, the only son, is Christ, and Christ is love.\r\n\r\n34  I came as man to manifest this love to men,\r\n\r\n35  As man I have been subject unto all the trials and temptations of\r\nthe human race; but I have overcome the flesh, with all its passions\r\nand its appetites.\r\n\r\n36  What I have done all men can do.\r\n\r\n37  And I am now about to demonstrate the power of man to conquer\r\ndeath; for every man is God made flesh.\r\n\r\n38  I will lay down my life, and I will take it up again, that you may\r\nknow the mysteries of life, of death, and of the resurrection of the\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n39  I lay me down in flesh, but I will rise in spirit form with power\r\nto manifest myself so mortal eyes can see.\r\n\r\n40  So in a trinity of days I will show forth the all of life, the all\r\nof death, the meaning of the resurrection of the dead.\r\n\r\n41  And what I do all men can do.\r\n\r\n42  And you, my three, who constitute the inner circle of the Church of\r\nChrist, will show to men the attributes of all the Gods.\r\n\r\n43  And Peter shall make known the Power of God; and James shall show\r\nthe Thought of God; and John shall demonstrate the Love of God.\r\n\r\n44  Be not afraid of men, for you have been sent forth to do the mighty\r\nworks of God the Father, God the Mother, God the Son.\r\n\r\n45  And all the powers of carnal life cannot destroy your life until\r\nyour work is done.\r\n\r\n46  I leave you now, and I will go out in the darkness all alone and\r\ntalk with God.\r\n\r\n47  By sorrow I am overwhelmed. I leave you here to watch with me.\r\n\r\n48  Then Jesus went three hundred cubits toward the east, and fell upon\r\nhis face and prayed; he said,\r\n\r\n49  My God! my God! is there a way by which I may escape the horrors of\r\nthe coming hours? My human flesh shrinks back; my soul is firm; so not\r\nmy will, but thine, O God, be done.\r\n\r\n50  In agony he prayed; the strain upon the human form was great; his\r\nveins were burst asunder, and his brow was bathed in blood.\r\n\r\n51  And then he went back to the three, and found them all asleep; he\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n52  O Simon, Simon, do you sleep! Could you not watch with me a single\r\nhour? Be vigilant, and watch and pray that your temptations be not too\r\ngreat for you to bear.\r\n\r\n53  I know the spirit is alert and willing; but the flesh is weak.\r\n\r\n54  And then he went again and prayed, O Father, God! if I must drink\r\nthis bitter cup, give me the strength of body, as I have the strength\r\nof soul; for not my will, but thine be done.\r\n\r\n55  And when he went again to his disciples; lo, he found them still\r\nasleep. He wakened them and said to James,\r\n\r\n56  Have you been sleeping while your master has been wrestling with\r\nthe greatest foe of men? Could you not watch with me a single hour?\r\n\r\n57  And then he went again and prayed. O God, I yield to thee; thy will\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\n58  And then again he went back to the three, and still they slept. He\r\nsaid to John,\r\n\r\n59  With all the love you have for me, could you not watch with me a\r\nsingle hour?\r\n\r\n60  And then he said, It is enough; the hour has come, and my betrayer\r\nis at hand; arise and let us go.\r\n\r\n61  And when they came again to Kidron, lo, the eight disciples were\r\nasleep, and Jesus said, You men, awake; behold, for the betrayer of\r\nthe son of man is come.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 164.\r\n\r\n    _Judas betrays his Lord with a kiss. Jesus is seized by the mob\r\n      and the disciples flee to save their lives. Jesus is taken\r\n      unto Jerusalem. Peter and John follow the mob._\r\n\r\nThe Lord with the eleven were in the orchard of Massalian, and as they\r\ntalked they saw a band of men with lanterns and with swords and clubs\r\napproaching them.\r\n\r\n2  And Jesus said, Behold the emissaries of the evil one! and Judas\r\nleads the way.\r\n\r\n3  And the disciples said, Lord, let us flee to save our lives.\r\n\r\n4  But Jesus said, Why should we flee to save our lives when this is\r\nthe fulfillment of the words of prophets and of seers?\r\n\r\n5  And Jesus went alone to meet the men; and as they came he said, Why\r\nare you here, you men? whom do you seek?\r\n\r\n6  And they replied, We seek the man from Galilee. We seek for Jesus,\r\none who calls himself the Christ.\r\n\r\n7  And Jesus answered, Here am I.\r\n\r\n8  And then he raised his hands and with a mighty thought he brought\r\nthe ethers to the state of light; and all the orchard was aglow with\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n9  The frenzied men were driven back and many fled and tarried not\r\nuntil they reached Jerusalem; and others fell upon their faces on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n10  The bravest men, and they with hardest hearts, remained, and when\r\nthe light had paled, the Lord again inquired, Whom do you seek?\r\n\r\n11  And Ananias said, We seek the man from Galilee; we seek for Jesus,\r\nhe who calls himself the Christ.\r\n\r\n12  And Jesus answered him and said, I told you once before; but now I\r\ntell you once again that I am he.\r\n\r\n13  By Ananias, Judas stood; but in a moment he had gone and coming up\r\nbehind the Lord he said, My Lord; and then he kissed him as a sign\r\nthat he was Jesus whom they sought.\r\n\r\n14  And Jesus said, Do you, Iscariot, come and thus betray your master\r\nwith a kiss?\r\n\r\n15  This thing must need be done; but woe to him who does betray his\r\nLord.\r\n\r\n16  Your carnal greed has seared your conscience and you know not what\r\nyou do; but in a little time your conscience will assert itself, and\r\nin remorse, lo, you will close your span and take your life.\r\n\r\n17  Then the eleven came, laid hold of Judas and would have done him\r\nharm; but Jesus said,\r\n\r\n18  You must not harm this man; you have no right to judge this man;\r\nhis conscience is his judge, will sentence him and he will execute\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n19  And then the mob led on by Malchus, servant of Caiaphas, laid hold\r\nof Jesus, and was binding him with chains.\r\n\r\n20  And Jesus said, Why do you come in dead of night with swords and\r\nclubs to take me in this sacred place?\r\n\r\n21  Have I not spoken in the public places of Jerusalem? Have I not\r\nhealed your sick, and opened up your blinded eyes, and made your lame\r\nto walk, your deaf to hear? You could have found me any day.\r\n\r\n22  And now you try to bind me down with chains; what are these chains\r\nbut links of reeds? And then he raised his hands; the chains were\r\nbroken and they fell to earth.\r\n\r\n23  And Malchus thought the Lord would flee to save his life, and with\r\na club he fain would smite him in the face.\r\n\r\n24  But Peter had a sword, and rushing up he smote the man and wounded\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n25  But Jesus said, Stay, Peter, stay; put up your sword; you are not\r\ncalled to fight with swords and clubs. Whoever wields the sword shall\r\nperish by the sword.\r\n\r\n26  I do not need protection by the sons of men, for I could call this\r\nmoment and a legion, yea, twelve legions of the messengers of God,\r\nwould come and stand in my defense; but then it is not well.\r\n\r\n27  And then he said to Malchus, Man, I would not have you harmed.\r\nAnd then he laid his hand upon the wound that Peter made, and it was\r\nhealed.\r\n\r\n28  Then Jesus said, Be not concerned lest I should tear myself away\r\nfrom you and flee to save my life. I have no wish to save my life; do\r\nwith me as you wish.\r\n\r\n29  And then the mob rushed up to seize the eleven to take them back to\r\nstand for trial as the aids of Jesus in his crimes.\r\n\r\n30  But the disciples, every one of them, deserted Jesus, and they fled\r\nto save their lives.\r\n\r\n31  Now, John was last to flee; the mob laid hold of him and tore his\r\ngarments all to shreds; but he escaped in nakedness.\r\n\r\n32  Massalian saw the man, and took him to his home and gave him other\r\nclothes; and then he followed after them who led the Lord away.\r\n\r\n33  And Peter was ashamed because of his weak cowardice, and when he\r\nwas himself again he joined with John and followed close behind the\r\nmob, and came into Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XIX.\r\n\r\nKOPH.\r\n\r\n_The Trial and Execution of Jesus._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 165.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus before Caiaphas.

A hundred perjured\r\n      witnesses testify to the truth of the charges._\r\n\r\nCaiaphas was the high priest of the Jews; the mob led Jesus to his\r\npalace hall.\r\n\r\n2  The court had been convened, and all the galleries were packed with\r\nscribes and Pharisees already sworn as witnesses against the Lord.\r\n\r\n3  The maid who kept the palace door knew John, and this disciple asked\r\nthat he and Peter be admitted to the hall.\r\n\r\n4  The maid permitted them to enter in, and John went in; but Peter was\r\nafraid and tarried in the outer court.\r\n\r\n5  The woman said to Peter, as he stood beside the door, Are you a\r\nfollower of this man from Galilee?\r\n\r\n6  And Peter said, No, I am not.\r\n\r\n7  The men who had brought Jesus to the hall sat by a fire in the outer\r\ncourt, because the night was cool, and Peter sat with them.\r\n\r\n8  Another maid who waited in the place saw Peter and she said to him,\r\nYou surely are from Galilee; your speech is that of Galilee; you are a\r\nfollower of this man.\r\n\r\n9  And Peter said, I know not what you mean; I do not even know this\r\nman.\r\n\r\n10  And then a servant of Caiaphas, one of those who seized the Lord\r\nand brought him to the court, saw Peter and he said to him,\r\n\r\n11  Did I not see you in the orchard of Massalian with this seditious\r\nNazarene? I’m sure I did, and you are one of those who followed him.\r\n\r\n12  Then Peter rose and stamped upon the floor, and swore by every\r\nsacred thing, that he knew not the criminal.\r\n\r\n13  Now, John was standing near and when he heard the words and knew\r\nthat Peter had denied his Lord, he looked at him in sheer astonishment.\r\n\r\n14  Just then a cock crew loud beneath the court, and Peter called to\r\nmind the words the Lord had said,\r\n\r\n15  Before the cock shall crow tomorrow morn you will deny me thrice.\r\n\r\n16  And Peter’s conscience smote him heavily, and he went out into the\r\nnight and wept.\r\n\r\n17  Caiaphas sat in state; before him stood the man from Galilee.\r\n\r\n18  Caiaphas said, You people of Jerusalem, who is the man that you\r\naccuse?\r\n\r\n19  They answered: In the name of every loyal Jew we do accuse this man\r\nfrom Galilee, this Jesus, who assumes to be our king, as enemy of God\r\nand man.\r\n\r\n20  Caiaphas said to Jesus, Man, you are permitted now to speak and\r\ntell about your doctrines and your claims.\r\n\r\n21  And Jesus said, You priest of carnal man, why do you ask about my\r\nwords and works?\r\n\r\n22  Lo, I have taught the multitudes in every public place; I have\r\nrestored your sick to health: have opened up your blinded eyes; have\r\ncaused your deaf to hear, your lame to walk, and I have brought your\r\ndead to life again.\r\n\r\n23  My works have not been done in secret place but in your public\r\nhalls and thoroughfares.\r\n\r\n24  Go ask the people, who have not been bought with gold or glittering\r\npromises, to tell about my words and works.\r\n\r\n25  When Jesus had thus said a Jewish guard came up and smote him in\r\nthe face and said, How dare you speak thus unto him, the high priest\r\nof the Jews?\r\n\r\n26  And Jesus said, If I have spoken falsely bear witness unto what I\r\nsay; if I have told the truth why did you smite me thus?\r\n\r\n27  And then Caiaphas said, What’er you do, do in a legal way, for we\r\nmust answer to a higher court for everything we do or say.\r\n\r\n28  Let the accusers of this man present their charges in a legal form.\r\n\r\n29  And then Caiaphas’ scribe stood forth and said, I have the\r\naccusations here in legal form; the charges made and signed by scribes\r\nand priests and Pharisees.\r\n\r\n30  Caiaphas said, Be still, you men, and hear the charges read. The\r\nscribe took up a roll and read:\r\n\r\n31  To the Sanhedrim of the Jews and to Caiaphas the high priest, most\r\nhonored men:\r\n\r\n32  The highest duty man can render to his nation and his own is to\r\nprotect them from their foes.\r\n\r\n33  The people of Jerusalem are conscious that a mighty foe is in their\r\nvery midst.\r\n\r\n34  A man named Jesus has come forth and claims to be the heir to\r\nDavid’s throne.\r\n\r\n35  As an impostor he is foe, and in the name of every loyal Jew we\r\nhere submit these charges, which we are competent to prove:\r\n\r\n36  And first, he blasphemes God; he says he is the son of God; that he\r\nand God are one;\r\n\r\n37  And he profanes our holy days by healing, and by doing other work\r\nupon the Sabbath days;\r\n\r\n38  And he proclaims himself the king, successor of our David and our\r\nSolomon;\r\n\r\n39  And he declares that he will tear our temple down and build it up\r\nagain in form more glorious in three days;\r\n\r\n40  And he declares that he will drive the people from Jerusalem, as he\r\ndrove out the merchants from the temple court; and bring to occupy our\r\nsacred hills a tribe of men that know not God;\r\n\r\n41  And he avers that every doctor, scribe and Pharisee and Sadducee,\r\nshall go in exile, and shall nevermore return;\r\n\r\n42  And to these charges we do set our hands and seals.\r\n\r\n  Annas.\r\n  Abinadab.\r\n  Joash.\r\n  Simon.\r\n  Annanias.\r\n  Azaniah.\r\n  Hezekiah.\r\n\r\n43  Now, when the scribe had read the charges, all the people called\r\nfor blood; they said, Let such a wretch be stoned; let him be\r\ncrucified.\r\n\r\n44  Caiaphas said, You men of Israel, do you sustain the charges of\r\nthese men?\r\n\r\n45  A hundred men who had been bribed, stood forth to testify; they\r\nswore that every charge was true.\r\n\r\n46  Caiaphas said to Jesus, Man, have you a word to say? are you the\r\nson of God?\r\n\r\n47  And Jesus said, So you have said; and then he said no more.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 166.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus before the Sanhedrim. Nicodemus pleads for justice; he\r\n      shows the incompetency of the witnesses. The council fail\r\n      to declare Jesus guilty, but Caiaphas, the presiding judge,\r\n      declares him guilty. The mob maltreat Jesus. He is taken to\r\n      Pilate’s court._\r\n\r\nWhen Jesus would not speak, Caiaphas stood before the Jewish mob and\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n2  Bind fast the prisoner, for he must go before the great Sanhedrim of\r\nthe Jews to answer for his life.\r\n\r\n3  We cannot execute a criminal until our findings have been verified\r\nby this, the highest council of the Jews.\r\n\r\n4  As soon as it was day the highest council of the people met; the\r\nLord and his accusers stood before the bar.\r\n\r\n5  Caiaphas was the chief; he rose and said, Let the accusers of this\r\nman from Galilee bring forth their charges and their evidence.\r\n\r\n6  Caiaphas’ scribe stood forth and read the charges and the names of\r\nthose who had accused the man from Galilee.\r\n\r\n7  And all the witnesses were made to stand and testify before the\r\ncouncil of the Jews.\r\n\r\n8  And then the lawyers weighed the evidence, and Nicodemus stood among\r\nthe men who plead.\r\n\r\n9  He raised his hands and said, Let justice now be done, though every\r\nscribe and Pharisee and priest and Sadducee, as well as Jesus, the\r\naccused, be judged a liar.\r\n\r\n10  If we can prove this Jesus to be foe and traitor to our laws and\r\nland, let him be judged a criminal and suffer for his crimes.\r\n\r\n11  If it be proved that these who testify are perjurers in the sight\r\nof God and man, then let them be adjudged as criminals, and let the\r\nman from Galilee go free.\r\n\r\n12  And then he brought the testimonies of the witnesses before the\r\njudges of the law; no two of them agreed. In heat of passion, or for\r\ngain, the men had testified.\r\n\r\n13  The council would have gladly judged that Jesus was a criminal and\r\nsentence him to death; but in the face of all the evidence they were\r\nafraid.\r\n\r\n14  And then Caiaphas said, You man from Galilee, Before the living\r\nGod, I now command that you shall answer me, Are you the Christ, the\r\nson of God?\r\n\r\n15  And Jesus said, If I would answer, Yes, you would not hear, nor yet\r\nbelieve,\r\n\r\n16  If I would answer, No, I would be like your witnesses, and stand a\r\nliar in the sight of man and God. But this I say,\r\n\r\n17  The time will come when you will see the son of man upon the throne\r\nof power and coming in the clouds of heaven.\r\n\r\n18  And then Caiaphas rent his clothes and said, Have you not heard\r\nenough? Did you not hear his vile blasphemous words? What further need\r\nhave we of witnesses? What shall we do with him?\r\n\r\n19  The people said, Put him to death. And then the mob rushed up and\r\nspit into his face, and struck him with their hands.\r\n\r\n20  And then they bound a cloth about his eyes and smote him in the\r\nface and said, You are a prophet; tell us who it was who smote you in\r\nthe face.\r\n\r\n21  And Jesus answered not and like a lamb before his shearer he, the\r\nman from Galilee, resisted not.\r\n\r\n22  Caiaphas said, We cannot put a man to death until the Roman ruler\r\nshall confirm the sentence of this court;\r\n\r\n23  So take this criminal away and Pilate will endorse what we have\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n24  And then was Jesus dragged along the way up to the palace of the\r\nRoman governor.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 167.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus before Pilate. Is pronounced not guilty. Jesus before\r\n      Herod and is tortured and returned to Pilate, who again\r\n      declares him innocent. The Jews demand his death. Pilate’s\r\n      wife urges her husband to have nothing to do with the\r\n      punishment of Jesus. Pilate weeps._\r\n\r\nInto the palace of the Roman governor the Jews would enter not lest\r\nthey become defiled and be unworthy to attend the feast; but they led\r\nJesus to the palace court, and Pilate met them there.\r\n\r\n2  And Pilate said, Why this commotion in the early day? What is your\r\nprayer?\r\n\r\n3  The Jews replied, We bring before you one, an evil and seditious man.\r\n\r\n4  He has been tried before the highest council of the Jews and has\r\nbeen proven traitor to our laws, our state and to the government of\r\nRome.\r\n\r\n5  We pray that you will sentence him to death upon the cross.\r\n\r\n6  And Pilate said, Why do you bring him unto me? Go to, and judge him\r\nfor yourselves.\r\n\r\n7  You have a law, and by the sanction of the Roman law, you have a\r\nright to judge and right to execute.\r\n\r\n8  The Jews replied, We have no right to execute a man upon the cross,\r\nand since this man is traitor to Tiberius, our counsellors believe\r\nthat he should meet the most humiliating death--the death upon the\r\ncross.\r\n\r\n9  But Pilate said, No man can be found guilty of a crime by Roman law\r\nuntil the testimony all is in, and the accused has been permitted to\r\ndefend himself;\r\n\r\n10  So I will take your bill of charges, with the evidence you have,\r\nand judge by Roman law.\r\n\r\n11  The Jews had made a copy of the accusations in the language of the\r\nRoman court, and they had added to the bill:\r\n\r\n12  We charge that Jesus is an enemy of Rome; that he demands that men\r\nshall pay no tribute to Tiberius.\r\n\r\n13  And Pilate took the bill; his guards led Jesus up the steps into\r\nthe palace hall.\r\n\r\n14  And Jesus stood before the Roman governor, and Pilate read to him\r\nthe charges of the Jews, and said,\r\n\r\n15  What is your answer to this bill? These charges, are they true or\r\nfalse?\r\n\r\n16  And Jesus said, Why should I plead before an earthly court? The\r\ncharges have been verified by perjured men; what need I say?\r\n\r\n17  Yes, I am king; but carnal men cannot behold the king, nor see the\r\nkingdom of the God; it is within.\r\n\r\n18  If I had been a king as carnal man is king, my servants would have\r\nstood in my defense, and I would not have willingly surrendered to the\r\nminions of the Jewish law.\r\n\r\n19  I have no testimony from the sons of men. God is my witness, and my\r\nwords and deeds bear witness to the truth;\r\n\r\n20  And every man who comprehends the truth will hearken to my words,\r\nand in his soul give witness unto me.\r\n\r\n21  And Pilate said, What is the truth?\r\n\r\n22  And Jesus said, Truth is the God who knows. It is the changeless\r\none. The Holy Breath is truth; she changes not and cannot pass away.\r\n\r\n23  And Pilate went again unto the Jews and said, This man is guilty of\r\nno crime; I cannot sentence him to death.\r\n\r\n24  And then the Jews grew boisterous; they cried aloud and said, Our\r\ncouncil surely knows. The wisest men of all the land have found him\r\nguilty of a score of crimes.\r\n\r\n25  He would pervert the nation of the Jews; would overthrow the Roman\r\nrule and make himself the king. He is a culprit come from Galilee; he\r\nmust be crucified.\r\n\r\n26  And Pilate said, If Jesus is from Galilee he is a subject of the\r\ngovernor of Galilee, who should be judge.\r\n\r\n27  Now, Herod had come down from Galilee and with his suite was in\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n28  And Pilate sent to him the Lord in chains; he also sent a copy of\r\nthe charges, and of the testimonies of the Jews, and asked that he\r\nwould pass in judgment on the case.\r\n\r\n29  And Herod said, I have heard much about this man and I am pleased\r\nto see him in my court.\r\n\r\n30  And then he asked the Lord about his claims, about his doctrines\r\nand his aims.\r\n\r\n31  And Jesus answered not a word; and Herod was enraged; he said, Do\r\nyou insult the ruler of the land by answering not?\r\n\r\n32  And then he called his guards and said, Take you this man and\r\ntorture him until he answers me.\r\n\r\n33  The guards took Jesus and they smote him; mocked him; wrapped him\r\nin a royal robe; they made a crown of thorns and put it on his head;\r\nthey put a broken reed into his hands;\r\n\r\n34  And then they said deridingly, All hail, thou royal king! Where are\r\nyour armies and your guards? Where are your subjects and your friends?\r\n\r\n35  But Jesus answered not a word. Then Herod sent him back to Pilate\r\nwith this note of courtesy:\r\n\r\n36  Most worthy counsellor of Rome, I have examined all the charges and\r\nthe testimonies that you sent to me regarding this seditious man from\r\nGalilee, and while I might adjudge him guilty of the crimes as charged,\r\n\r\n37  I yield to you my rights as judge, because you are superior to me\r\nin power. I will approve of any judgment you may render in this case.\r\n\r\n38  Now, Pilate and the tetrarch had been foes, but the experience of\r\nthis hour destroyed their enmity and they were friends in after days.\r\n\r\n39  When Jesus had been brought again to Pilate’s court, the Roman\r\ngovernor stood forth before the accusers of the Lord and said,\r\n\r\n40  I cannot find this Nazarene to be a criminal as charged; there is\r\nno evidence that he should suffer death; so I will scourge him well\r\nand let him go.\r\n\r\n41  The Jews cried angrily, It is not mete that such a dangerous man\r\nshould live; he must be crucified.\r\n\r\n42  Then Pilate said, I bid you wait a little time. And then he went\r\ninto an inner room and sat in silent thought.\r\n\r\n43  And as he mused his wife, a godly woman, chosen from among the\r\nGauls, came in and said,\r\n\r\n44  I pray you, Pilate, hearken unto me: Beware of what you do this\r\nhour. Touch not this man from Galilee; he is a holy man.\r\n\r\n45  If you should scourge this man you scourge the son of God. Last\r\nnight I saw it all in vision far too vivid to be set aside as idle\r\ndream.\r\n\r\n46  I saw this man walk on the waters of the sea; I heard him speak and\r\ncalm an angry storm; I saw him flying with the wings of light;\r\n\r\n47  I saw Jerusalem in blood; I saw the statues of the Cæsars fall; I\r\nsaw a veil before the sun, and day was dark as night.\r\n\r\n48  The earth on which I stood was shaken like a reed before the wind.\r\nI tell you, Pilate, if you bathe your hands in this man’s blood then\r\nyou may dread the frowns of great Tiberius, and the curses of the\r\nsenators of Rome.\r\n\r\n49  And then she left, and Pilate wept.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 168.\r\n\r\n    _Pilate’s final effort to release Jesus fails. He washes his\r\n      hands in feigned innocence. Delivers Jesus to the Jews for\r\n      execution. The Jewish soldiers drive him to Calvary._\r\n\r\nA superstitious people are the Jews. They have a faith that they have\r\nborrowed from the idol worshippers of other lands, that at the end of\r\nevery year,\r\n\r\n2  They may heap all their sins upon the head of some man set apart to\r\nbear their sins.\r\n\r\n3  The man becomes a scapegoat for the multitudes; and they believe\r\nthat when they drive him forth into the wilds, or into foreign lands,\r\nthey are released from sin.\r\n\r\n4  So every spring before the feast they chose a prisoner from the\r\nprisons of the land, and by a form their own, they fain would make him\r\nbear their sins away.\r\n\r\n5  Among the Jewish prisoners in Jerusalem were three who were the\r\nleaders of a vile, seditious band, who had engaged in thefts and\r\nmurders and rapine, and had been sentenced to be crucified.\r\n\r\n6  Barabbas bar Jezia was among the men who were to die; but he was\r\nrich and he had bought of priests the boon to be the scapegoat for the\r\npeople at the coming feast, and he was anxiously in waiting for his\r\nhour to come.\r\n\r\n7  Now, Pilate thought to turn this superstition to account to save the\r\nLord, and so he went again before the Jews and said,\r\n\r\n8  You men of Israel, according to my custom I will release to you\r\ntoday a prisoner who shall bear your sins away.\r\n\r\n9  This man you drive into the wilds or into foreign lands, and you\r\nhave asked me to release Barabbas, who has been proven guilty of the\r\nmurder of a score of men.\r\n\r\n10  Now, hear me men, Let Jesus be released and let Barabbas pay his\r\ndebt upon the cross; then you can send this Jesus to the wilds and\r\nhear no more of him.\r\n\r\n11  At what the ruler said the people were enraged, and they began to\r\nplot to tear the Roman palace down and drive in exile Pilate, and his\r\nhousehold and his guards.\r\n\r\n12  When Pilate was assured that civil war would follow if he heeded\r\nnot the wishes of the mob, he took a bowl of water and in the\r\npresence of the multitude he washed his hands and said,\r\n\r\n13  This man whom you accuse, is son of the most holy Gods, and I\r\nproclaim my innocence.\r\n\r\n14  If you would shed his blood, his blood is on your hands and not on\r\nmine.\r\n\r\n15  And then the Jews exclaimed, And let his blood be on our hands and\r\non our children’s hands.\r\n\r\n16  And Pilate trembled like a leaf, in fear. Barabbas he released and\r\nas the Lord stood forth before the mob the ruler said, Behold your\r\nking! And would you put to death your king?\r\n\r\n17  The Jews replied, He is no king; we have no king but great Tiberius.\r\n\r\n18  Now, Pilate would not give consent that Roman soldiers should\r\nimbue their hands in blood of innocence, and so the chief priests and\r\nthe Pharisees took counsel what to do with Jesus, who was called the\r\nChrist.\r\n\r\n19  Caiaphas said, We cannot crucify this man; he must be stoned to\r\ndeath and nothing more.\r\n\r\n20  And then the rabble said, Make haste! let him be stoned. And then\r\nthey led him forth toward the hill beyond the city’s gates, where\r\ncriminals were put to death.\r\n\r\n21  The rabble could not wait until they reached the place of skulls.\r\nAs soon as they had passed the city’s gate, they rushed upon him,\r\nsmote him with their hands, they spit upon him, stoned him and he fell\r\nupon the ground.\r\n\r\n22  And one, a man of God, stood forth and said, Isaiah said, He shall\r\nbe bruised for our transgressions and by his stripes we shall be\r\nhealed.\r\n\r\n23  As Jesus lay all bruised and mangled on the ground a Pharisee\r\ncalled out, Stay, stay you men! behold, the guards of Herod come and\r\nthey will crucify this man.\r\n\r\n24  And there beside the city’s gate they found Barabbas’ cross; and\r\nthen the frenzied mob cried out, Let him be crucified.\r\n\r\n25  Caiaphas and the other ruling Jews came forth and gave consent.\r\n\r\n26  And then they lifted Jesus from the ground, and at the point of\r\nswords they drove him on.\r\n\r\n27  A man named Simon, from Cyrene, a friend of Jesus, was a-near the\r\nscene and since the bruised and wounded Jesus could not bear his\r\ncross, they laid it on the shoulders of this man and made him bear it\r\non to Calvary.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 169.\r\n\r\n    _Judas is filled with remorse. Hurries to the temple and throws\r\n      the thirty pieces of silver at the feet of the priests who\r\n      take it and buy a potter’s field. Judas hangs himself. His\r\n      body is buried in the potter’s field._\r\n\r\nNow, Judas who betrayed his Lord, was with the mob; but all the time\r\nhe thought that Jesus would assert his power and demonstrate the\r\nstrength of God that he possessed, and strike to earth the fiendish\r\nmultitudes and free himself;\r\n\r\n2  But when he saw his master on the ground and bleeding from a score\r\nof wounds, he said,\r\n\r\n3  O God, what have I done? I have betrayed the son of God; the curse\r\nof God will rest upon my soul.\r\n\r\n4  And then he turned and ran with haste until he reached the temple\r\ndoor; he found the priests, who gave to him the thirty silver pieces\r\nto betray the Lord, and said,\r\n\r\n5  Take back your bribe; it is the cost price of my soul; I have\r\nbetrayed the son of God.\r\n\r\n6  The priests replied, That matters not to us.\r\n\r\n7  Then Judas threw the silver on the floor, and, bowed with grief, he\r\nwent away, and on a ledge beyond the city’s walls he hanged himself\r\nand died.\r\n\r\n8  In time the fastenings gave way, his body fell into the Hinnon vale\r\nand after many days they found it there a shapeless mass.\r\n\r\n9  The rulers could not put the price of blood into the treasury,\r\nand so they took the thirty silver pieces with which they bought a\r\npotter’s field,\r\n\r\n10  Where they might bury those who had no rights to lie within their\r\nsacred burial grounds.\r\n\r\n11  And there they put the body of the man who sold his Lord.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 170.\r\n\r\n    _The crucifixion.

When Jesus saw them weeping and lamenting thus he\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n3  Weep not for me, for though I go away, go through the gateway of the\r\ncross, yet on the next day of the sun, lift up your hearts, for I will\r\nmeet you at the sepulchre.\r\n\r\n4  The great procession came to Calvary. The Roman soldiers had already\r\nbound the two state prisoners to the cross.\r\n\r\n5  (They were not nailed, but simply bound.)\r\n\r\n6  Four soldiers of the Roman guard that Herod brought from Galilee\r\nwere called to execute the orders of the court.\r\n\r\n7  These were the men who had been set apart to torture Jesus and\r\nsecure from him confession of his guilt.\r\n\r\n8  These were the men who scourged him, put a crown of thorns upon his\r\nhead, a broken reed into his hands, and wrapped him in a royal robe,\r\nand bowed in mockery, before him as a king.\r\n\r\n9  These soldiers took the Lord and stripped him, laid him on the cross\r\nand would have bound him there with cords; but this would not suffice.\r\n\r\n10  The cruel Jews were near with hammer and with nails; they cried,\r\nnot cords, but nails; drive fast the nails and hold him to the cross.\r\n\r\n11  And then the soldiers took the nails and drove them through his\r\nfeet and hands.\r\n\r\n12  They offered him a sedative to drink, a draught of vinegar and\r\nmyrrh; but he refused to drink the draught.\r\n\r\n13  The soldiers had prepared a place in which to plant Barabbas’ cross\r\nbetween the other criminals; and here they raised the cross of Jesus,\r\nwho was called the Christ;\r\n\r\n14  And then the soldiers and the mob sat down to watch him die.\r\n\r\n15  And Jesus said, My Father-God, forgive these men; they know not\r\nwhat they do.\r\n\r\n16  Now, Pilate had prepared a tablet to be placed upon the cross on\r\nwhich was written in the tongues of Hebrew, Latin and the Greek these\r\nwords of truth: JESUS THE CHRIST, KING OF THE JEWS.\r\n\r\n17  And this was placed upon the cross. The priests were angered when\r\nthey read these words upon the tablet of the cross.\r\n\r\n18  And then they prayed that Pilate would not say, He is the Christ,\r\nking of the Jews; but say, He claims to be the Christ, king of the\r\nJews.\r\n\r\n19  But Pilate said, What I have written, I have written; let it stand.\r\n\r\n20  The Jewish multitudes who saw the Lord upon the cross were wild\r\nwith joy; they said, All hail, fake king!\r\n\r\n21  You who would tear the temple down and in three days would build it\r\nup again, why don’t you save yourself?\r\n\r\n22  If you are Christ, the son of God, come from the cross; then all\r\nmen will believe.\r\n\r\n23  The priests and scribes and Pharisees looked on the scene and\r\nscoffed; they said, He rescued others from the grave; why don’t he\r\nsave himself?\r\n\r\n24  The Jewish soldiers and the Roman guards who came from Galilee were\r\nloud in mocking and deriding him.\r\n\r\n25  One of the other men upon the cross joined in the mockery; he said,\r\nIf you are Christ, you have the power; just speak the Word, and save\r\nyourself and me.\r\n\r\n26  The other man upon the cross rebuked the man; he said, You wretch!\r\nhave you no fear of God?\r\n\r\n27  This man is innocent of any crime while you and I are guilty and\r\nare paying up the debts we owe.\r\n\r\n28  And then he said to Jesus, Lord, I know thy kingdom comes, the\r\nkingdom that the world can never comprehend;\r\n\r\n29  And when thou comest on the clouds of heaven, remember me.\r\n\r\n30  And Jesus said, Behold, for I will meet you in the realm of souls\r\nthis day.\r\n\r\n31  Now, standing near unto the cross were many women from Judea and\r\nfrom Galilee. Among them were the mother of the Lord and Miriam,\r\n\r\n32  And Mary, mother of the two apostles, James and John, and Mary\r\nMagdalene, and Martha, Ruth and Mary, and Salome.\r\n\r\n33  When Jesus saw his mother and the singer Miriam standing close\r\nbeside the cross and John a-near, he said to John,\r\n\r\n34  In your most tender care I leave my mother and my sister Miriam.\r\n\r\n35  And John replied, While they shall live my home shall be the home\r\nof your thrice blessed mother and your sister Miriam.\r\n\r\n36  According to a custom of the Jews, to those who were the\r\nexecutioners of law and took the lives of criminals, belonged the\r\ngarments of the criminals.\r\n\r\n37  So when the Lord was crucified, the Roman guards divided up among\r\nthemselves the garments of the Lord.\r\n\r\n38  But when they found his coat it was a seamless coat and highly\r\nprized.\r\n\r\n39  For it the guards cast lots, and thus determined who should have\r\nthe prize.\r\n\r\n40  And thus the scripture was fulfilled, which said, And they divided\r\nall my robes among themselves, and for my vesture they cast lots.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 171.\r\n\r\n    _Concluding scenes of the crucifixion. Joseph and Nicodemus,\r\n      by consent of Pilate, take the body of Jesus from the cross\r\n      and lay it in Joseph’s tomb. A guard of one hundred Jewish\r\n      soldiers are placed about the sepulcher._\r\n\r\nNow, at the sixth hour of the day, although the sun was at its height,\r\nthe day became as dark as night;\r\n\r\n2  And men sought lanterns and they builded fires upon the hills that\r\nthey might see.\r\n\r\n3  And when the sun refused to shine and darkness came, the Lord\r\nexclaimed, _Heloi! Heloi! lama sabachthani?_ (Thou sun! thou sun! why\r\nhast thou forsaken me?)\r\n\r\n4  The people did not understand the words he spoke; they thought he\r\nspoke the name Elijah and they said,\r\n\r\n5  He calls upon Elijah in his hour of need; now we will see if he will\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n6  And Jesus said, I thirst. A Roman soldier dipped a sponge in vinegar\r\nand myrrh, and placed it to his lips.\r\n\r\n7  Now, at the ninth hour of the day the earth began to quake, and in\r\nthe darkness of that sunless day, a flood of golden light appeared\r\nabove the cross;\r\n\r\n8  And from the light a voice was heard which said, Lo, it is done.\r\n\r\n9  And Jesus said, My Father-God, into thy hands I give my soul.\r\n\r\n10  A Roman soldier in compassion said, This agony is all too great;\r\nrelief shall come. And with a spear he pierced his heart and it was\r\ndone; the son of man was dead.\r\n\r\n11  And then the earth was shocked again; the city of Jerusalem rocked\r\nto and fro; the hills were rent and tombs were opened up;\r\n\r\n12  And people thought they saw the dead arise and walk the streets.\r\n\r\n13  The temple quivered and the veil between the sanctuary and the Holy\r\nPlace was rent in twain, and consternation reigned through all the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n14  The Roman guard who watched the body on the cross exclaimed, This\r\nsurely was the son of God who died.\r\n\r\n15  And then the people hurried down from Calvary. The priests, the\r\nPharisees and scribes were filled with fear.\r\n\r\n16  They sought the cover of their synagogues and homes and said,\r\nBehold, the wrath of God!\r\n\r\n17  The great day of the Jewish pasch was near, and Jews could not by\r\nlaw permit a criminal to hang upon the cross upon the Sabbath day.\r\n\r\n18  And so they prayed that Pilate would remove the bodies of the men\r\nthat had been crucified.\r\n\r\n19  And Pilate sent his guards to Calvary to note if all the men were\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n20  And when the guards were gone, two aged Jews came to the palace\r\ndoor to see the governor, and they were members of the highest council\r\nof the Jews;\r\n\r\n21  Yet they believed that Jesus was a prophet sent from God.\r\n\r\n22  The one was Rabbi Joseph, the Arimathean counsellor, and he was\r\njust and loved the law of God.\r\n\r\n23  And Nicodemus was the other one who came.\r\n\r\n24  These men fell down at Pilate’s feet and prayed that they might\r\ntake the body of the Nazarene and lay it in a tomb.\r\n\r\n25  And Pilate gave consent.\r\n\r\n26  Now, Joseph had prepared a costly mixture to embalm the body of\r\nthe Lord, about a hundred pounds of aloes and of myrrh, and this they\r\ntook and hastened out to Calvary.\r\n\r\n27  And when the guards returned they said, The Nazarene is dead; the\r\nmalefactors are alive.\r\n\r\n28  And Pilate told the guards to go and smite the living men so they\r\nwould die, and then to give their bodies to the flames; but give the\r\nbody of the Nazarene to rabbis who would call for it.\r\n\r\n29  The soldiers did as Pilate said.\r\n\r\n30  The rabbis came and took away the body of the Lord and when they\r\nhad prepared it with the spices they had bought,\r\n\r\n31  They laid it in the new-made tomb that had been made for Joseph in\r\na solid rock.\r\n\r\n32  And then they rolled a stone up to the sepulcher.\r\n\r\n33  The priests were fearful lest the friends of Jesus would go forth\r\nat night and take away the body of the Nazarene, and then report that\r\nhe had risen from the dead, as he had said;\r\n\r\n34  And they requested that the governor would send his soldiers to the\r\ntomb to guard the body of the dead.\r\n\r\n35  But Pilate said, I will not send a Roman guard; but you have Jewish\r\nsoldiers and may send a hundred men with a centurion to guard the tomb.\r\n\r\n36  And then they sent a hundred soldiers out to guard the tomb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XX.\r\n\r\nRESH.\r\n\r\n_The Resurrection of Jesus._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 172.\r\n\r\n    _Pilate places the Roman seal upon the stone door of the tomb.\r\n      At midnight a company of the silent brothers march about the\r\n      tomb. The soldiers are alarmed. Jesus preaches to the spirits\r\n      in prison. Early Sunday morning he rises from the tomb. The\r\n      soldiers are bribed by the priests to say that the disciples\r\n      had stolen the body._\r\n\r\nThe tomb in which they laid the body of the Lord was in a garden, rich\r\nwith flowers, the garden of Siloam, and Joseph’s home was near.\r\n\r\n2  Before the watch began Caiaphas sent a company of priests out to\r\nthe garden of Siloam that they might be assured that Jesus’ body was\r\nwithin the tomb.\r\n\r\n3  They rolled away the stone; they saw the body there, and then they\r\nplaced the stone again before the door.\r\n\r\n4  And Pilate sent his scribe who placed upon the stone the seal of\r\nRome, in such a way that he who moved the stone would break the seal.\r\n\r\n5  To break this Roman seal meant death to him who broke the seal.\r\n\r\n6  The Jewish soldiers all were sworn to faithfulness; and then the\r\nwatch began.\r\n\r\n7  At midnight all was well, but suddenly the tomb became a blaze\r\nof light, and down the garden walk a troupe of white clad soldiers\r\nmarched in single file.\r\n\r\n8  They came up to the tomb and marched and countermarched before the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n9  The Jewish soldiers were alert; they thought the friends had come to\r\nsteal the body of the Nazarene. The captain of the guard cried out to\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n10  They charged; but not a white clad soldier fell. They did not even\r\nstop; they marched and countermarched among the frightened men.\r\n\r\n11  They stood upon the Roman seal; they did not speak; they unsheathed\r\nnot their swords; it was the Silent Brotherhood.\r\n\r\n12  The Jewish soldiers fled in fear; they fell upon the ground.\r\n\r\n13  They stood apart until the white clad soldiers marched away, and\r\nthen the light about the tomb grew dim.\r\n\r\n14  Then they returned; the stone was in its place; the seal was not\r\ndisturbed, and they resumed their watch.\r\n\r\n15  Now, Jesus did not sleep within the tomb. The body is the manifest\r\nof soul; but soul is soul without its manifest.\r\n\r\n16  And in the realm of souls, unmanifest, the Lord went forth and\r\ntaught.\r\n\r\n17  He opened up the prison doors and set the prisoners free;\r\n\r\n18  He broke the chains of captive souls, and led the captives to the\r\nlight;\r\n\r\n19  He sat in council with the patriarchs and prophets of the olden\r\ntimes;\r\n\r\n20  The masters of all times and climes he met, and in the great\r\nassemblies he stood forth and told the story of his life on earth, and\r\nof his death in sacrifice for man,\r\n\r\n21  And of his promises to clothe himself again in garb of flesh and\r\nwalk with his disciples, just to prove the possibilities of man;\r\n\r\n22  To give to them the key of life, of death, and of the resurrection\r\nof the dead.\r\n\r\n23  In council all the masters sat and talked about the revelations of\r\nthe coming age,\r\n\r\n24  When she, the Holy Breath, shall fill the earth and air with holy\r\nbreath, and open up the way of man to perfectness and endless life.\r\n\r\n25  The garden of Siloam was silent on the Sabbath day; the Jewish\r\nsoldiers watched and no one else approached the tomb; but on the\r\nfollowing night the scene was changed.\r\n\r\n26  At midnight every Jewish soldier heard a voice which said, _Adon\r\nMashich Cumi_, which meant, Lord Christ arise.\r\n\r\n27  And they supposed again that friends of Jesus were alert, were\r\ncoming up to take the body of their Lord away.\r\n\r\n28  The soldiers were alert with swords unsheathed and drawn, and then\r\nthey heard the words again.\r\n\r\n29  It seemed as though the voice was everywhere, and yet they saw no\r\nman.\r\n\r\n30  The soldiers blanched with fear, and still to flee meant death for\r\ncowardice, and so they stood and watched.\r\n\r\n31  Again, and this was just before the sun arose, the heavens blazed\r\nwith light, a distant thunder seemed to herald forth a coming storm;\r\n\r\n32  And then the earth began to quake and in the rays of light they saw\r\na form descend from heaven, They said, Behold an angel comes.\r\n\r\n33  And then they heard again, _Adon Mashich Cumi_.\r\n\r\n34  And then the white-robed form tramped on the Roman seal, and then\r\nhe tore it into shreds; he took the mighty stone in hand as though it\r\nwere a pebble from the brook, and cast it to the side.\r\n\r\n35  And Jesus opened up his eyes and said, All hail the rising sun! the\r\ncoming of the day of righteousness!\r\n\r\n36  And then he folded up his burial gown, his head bands and his\r\ncoverings and laid them all aside.\r\n\r\n37  He rose, and for a moment stood beside the white-robed form.\r\n\r\n38  The weaker soldiers fell upon the ground, and hid their faces in\r\ntheir hands; the stronger stood and watched.\r\n\r\n39  They saw the body of the Nazarene transmute; they saw it change\r\nfrom mortal to immortal form, and then it disappeared.\r\n\r\n40  The soldiers heard a voice from somewhere; yea, from everywhere, it\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n41  Peace, peace on earth; good will to men.\r\n\r\n42  They looked, the tomb was empty and the Lord had risen as he said.\r\n\r\n43  The soldiers hastened to Jerusalem, and to the priests, and said,\r\n\r\n44  Behold, the Nazarene has risen as he said; the tomb is empty and\r\nthe body of the man is gone; we know not where it is. And then they\r\ntold about the wonders of the night.\r\n\r\n45  Caiaphas called a council of the Jews; he said, the news must not\r\ngo forth that Jesus has arisen from the dead;\r\n\r\n46  For if it does all men will say, He is the son of God, and all our\r\ntestimonies will be proven false.\r\n\r\n47  And then they called the hundred soldiers in and said to them,\r\n\r\n48  You know not where the body of the Nazarene is resting now, so if\r\nyou will go forth and say that his disciples came and stole the body\r\nwhile you slept,\r\n\r\n49  Each one of you shall have a silver piece, and we will make it\r\nright with Pilate for the breaking of the Roman seal.\r\n\r\n50  The soldiers did as they were paid to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXI.\r\n\r\nSCHIN.\r\n\r\n_Materialization of the Spiritual Body of Jesus._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 173.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus appears, fully materialized, to his mother, Miriam, Mary\r\n      of Magdala and to Peter, James and John._\r\n\r\nNow, when the rabbis took the body of the Lord and laid it in the tomb\r\nthe mother of the Lord, and Mary Magdalene, and Miriam were there.\r\n\r\n2  And when the body was entombed they went to Joseph’s home and there\r\nabode.\r\n\r\n3  They did not know that Jewish soldiers had been sent to guard the\r\ntomb, nor that the Roman seal was placed upon the stone;\r\n\r\n4  So in the morning of the first day of the week they hastened to the\r\ntomb with spices to embalm the Lord.\r\n\r\n5  But when they reached the tomb they found the terror-stricken\r\nsoldiers running frantically about.\r\n\r\n6  The women did not know the cause; but when they found an empty tomb\r\nthey were excited and aggrieved.\r\n\r\n7  The soldiers did not know what had transpired; they could not tell\r\nwho took the body of the Lord away.\r\n\r\n8  And Mary Magdalene ran with haste toward Jerusalem to tell the news\r\nto Peter and the rest.\r\n\r\n9  She met, just by the gateway, Peter, James and John; she said, Some\r\none has rolled away the stone and carried off the body of the Lord.\r\n\r\n10  And then the three disciples ran toward the tomb; but John was\r\nfleet of foot and was the first to reach the tomb; he found it empty;\r\nthe body of his Lord was gone.\r\n\r\n11  When Peter came he went into the tomb, and found the grave clothes\r\nneatly folded up and laid aside.\r\n\r\n12  Now, the disciples did not comprehend the scene. They did not know\r\nthe meaning of their Lord when he informed them just before his death\r\nthat he would rise from death upon the first day of the week.\r\n\r\n13  The three disciples went back to Jerusalem; the mother of the Lord\r\nand Miriam went not away.\r\n\r\n14  And Mary looked within the tomb, and saw two masters sitting there;\r\nthey said, Why do you weep?\r\n\r\n15  And Mary said, Because my Lord is gone; some one has carried off\r\nthe body of my Lord; I know not where it is.\r\n\r\n16  Then she arose and looked around; a man stood near and said, Why do\r\nyou weep? whom do you seek?\r\n\r\n17  And Mary thought it was the gardener and said, If you have borne\r\naway the body of my Lord, O tell me where it is that I may lay it in a\r\nsacred tomb.\r\n\r\n18  And then the man came near and said, My mother! and Mary said, My\r\nLord!\r\n\r\n19  The eyes of Miriam were opened up and she beheld the Lord.\r\n\r\n20  And Jesus said, Behold, I told you as we walked along the way up to\r\nthe cross that I would meet you at the sepulcher upon the first day of\r\nthe week.\r\n\r\n21  Now, Mary Magdalene was sitting not a great way off, and Jesus went\r\nto her and said,\r\n\r\n22  Why seek the living ’mong the dead? Your Lord has risen as he said.\r\nNow, Mary, look! behold my face!\r\n\r\n23  Then Mary knew it was the Lord; that he had risen from the dead.\r\n\r\n24  And then Salome, and Mary, mother of the two disciples, James and\r\nJohn, Joanna, and the other women who had come out to the tomb, saw\r\nJesus, and they talked with him.\r\n\r\n25  And Mary Magdalene was filled with joy. She sought again for Peter,\r\nJames and John; she found them and she said,\r\n\r\n26  Lo, I have seen the Lord; and Miriam has seen the Lord; the mother\r\nof the Lord has seen the Lord; and many more have seen his face; for\r\nhe has risen from the dead.\r\n\r\n27  But the disciples thought that she had simply seen a vision of the\r\nLord. They did not think that he had risen from the dead.\r\n\r\n28  Then Mary found the other members of the company and told them all\r\nabout the risen Lord; but none of them believed.\r\n\r\n29  Now, Peter, James and John were in the garden of Siloam; were\r\ntalking with the gardener about the happenings of the day when John\r\nbeheld a stranger coming up the walk.\r\n\r\n30  The stranger lifted up his hands and said, I am. Then the\r\ndisciples knew it was the Lord.\r\n\r\n31  And Jesus said, Behold, for human flesh can be transmuted into\r\nhigher form, and then that higher form is master of things manifest,\r\nand can, at will, take any form.\r\n\r\n32  And so I come to you in form familiar unto you.\r\n\r\n33  Go speak to Thomas, and the other men whom I have called to be\r\napostles unto men, and say to them,\r\n\r\n34  That he whom Jews and Romans thought was dead is walking in the\r\ngarden of Siloam;\r\n\r\n35  Will stand again before the priests and Pharisees within the temple\r\nin Jerusalem;\r\n\r\n36  And will appear unto the sages of the world.\r\n\r\n37  Tell them that I will go before them into Galilee.\r\n\r\n38  Then Peter, James and John went forth and found their brethren, and\r\nsaid, Behold, the Lord is risen from the dead, and we have seen him\r\nface to face.\r\n\r\n39  The brethren were amazed at what the three disciples said; but\r\nstill they looked upon their words as idle talk and they believed them\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 174.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus appears, fully materialized, to Zachus and Cleophas as\r\n      they journey to Emmaus, but they know him not. He tells them\r\n      many things about Christ. He eats the evening meal with them,\r\n      and reveals himself to them. They go to Jerusalem and tell\r\n      the news._\r\n\r\nTowards the evening of the resurrection day, two friends of Jesus,\r\nZachus and Cleophas of Emmaus, seven miles away, were going to their\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n2  And as they walked and talked about the things that had occurred a\r\nstranger joined their company.\r\n\r\n3  He said, My friends, you seem discouraged and are sad. Has some\r\ngreat grief upon you come?\r\n\r\n4  Cleophas said, Are you a stranger in Judea, and know not of the\r\nthrilling things that have transpired here?\r\n\r\n5  The stranger said, What things? To what do you refer?\r\n\r\n6  Cleophas said, Have you not heard about the man from Galilee who was\r\na prophet mighty in both word and deed?\r\n\r\n7  A man whom many thought had come to found again the kingdom of the\r\nJews, and drive the Romans from the city of Jerusalem and be himself\r\nthe king?\r\n\r\n8  The stranger said, Tell me about this man.\r\n\r\n9  Cleophas said, His name was Jesus; he was born in Bethlehem; his\r\nhome was up in Galilee. He loved the people as he loved himself.\r\n\r\n10  He was, in truth, a master sent from God, for he had matchless\r\npower. He healed the sick and made the deaf to hear, the blind to see,\r\nthe lame to walk, and even raised the dead.\r\n\r\n11  The Jewish scribes and Pharisees were jealous of his fame and\r\npower, and they arrested him; by perjured witnesses they proved him\r\nguilty of a score of crimes,\r\n\r\n12  And on last Friday he was taken to the place of skulls and\r\ncrucified.\r\n\r\n13  He died and he was buried in a rich man’s tomb, out in the garden\r\nof Siloam.\r\n\r\n14  This very morning when his friends went to the tomb they found it\r\nempty; the body of the Lord was gone.\r\n\r\n15  And now the news has spread abroad that he has risen from the dead.\r\n\r\n16  The stranger said, Yes, I have heard about this man; but it seems\r\nstrange that after all the things that Jewish prophets long ago\r\nforetold concerning him that when he came men knew him not.\r\n\r\n17  This man was born to demonstrate the Christ to men, and it is just\r\nto say that Jesus is the Christ.\r\n\r\n18  According to the Word, this Jesus came to suffer at the hands of\r\nmen, to give his life as pattern for the sons of men;\r\n\r\n19  To rise from death that men might know the way to rise from death.\r\n\r\n20  And then the stranger told the two disciples all about the Law, the\r\nProphets and the Psalms, and read to them a multitude of things that\r\nhad been written of this man from Galilee.\r\n\r\n21  And now the men had reached their home and as the night was near\r\nthey importuned the stranger to abide with them.\r\n\r\n22  And he went in with them and as they sat about the table at the\r\nevening meal, he took a piece of bread, and blessed it in the name of\r\nChrist.\r\n\r\n23  And instantly their eyes were opened up, and they perceived that\r\nhe, the stranger, was the Lord, the man from Galilee; that he had\r\nrisen from the dead; and then the form of Jesus disappeared.\r\n\r\n24  When he had gone, the two disciples were amazed. They said, Did not\r\nour hearts burn with delight while he was talking to us by the way and\r\nopening up the testimonies of the Law, the Prophets and the Psalms?\r\n\r\n25  Then Zachus and Cleopas went back to Jerusalem, and everywhere they\r\nwent they said, Lo, we have seen the Lord;\r\n\r\n26  He walked with us to Emmaus; he ate with us the evening meal, and\r\nbroke for us the bread of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 175.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus appears, fully materialized, to the ten apostles in\r\n      Simon’s house, and to Lazarus and his sisters._\r\n\r\nThe evening of the resurrection day had come; the ten apostles were in\r\nSimon’s house in Bethany. The lawyer, Thomas, was not there.\r\n\r\n2  The doors were closed and barred, because the Jews had said that\r\nthey would drive the Galileans from the land.\r\n\r\n3  And as they talked, lo, Jesus came and stood forth in their midst,\r\nand said, Peace! peace!\r\n\r\n4  And the disciples shrank in fear; they thought it was a phantom that\r\nthey saw.\r\n\r\n5  And Jesus said, Why are you troubled thus? why do you fear? I am no\r\nphantom form. I am your Lord, and I have risen from the dead.\r\n\r\n6  I often said, I will arise; but you believed me not; and now come\r\nhere and see. A phantom has not flesh and bones and brawn, like I\r\npossess.\r\n\r\n7  Come now, and clasp my hands, and touch my feet, and lay your hands\r\nupon my head.\r\n\r\n8  And every one came up and clasped his hands, and touched his feet,\r\nand laid his hands upon his head.\r\n\r\n9  And Jesus said, Have you here anything to eat?\r\n\r\n10  And they brought out a fragment of a fish; he ate it in the\r\npresence of them all, and then the ten believed.\r\n\r\n11  Nathaniel said, And now we know that he has risen from the dead; he\r\nstands a surety of the resurrection of the dead. And Jesus disappeared.\r\n\r\n12  Now, Mary, Martha, Ruth and Lazarus were in their home, and they\r\nhad heard the rumor that their Lord had risen from the dead, and\r\nMartha said,\r\n\r\n13  It cannot be, for such a thing has never happened since the world\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\n14  But Mary said, Did not the Lord bring back our brother from the\r\ndead? and he could surely bring himself to life again.\r\n\r\n15  And as they talked, the Lord stood in their midst and said,\r\n\r\n16  All hail! for I am risen from the dead, first fruitage of the grave!\r\n\r\n17  And Martha ran and brought the chair in which the Lord had ever\r\nloved to sit, and Jesus sat down on the chair.\r\n\r\n18  And for a long, long time they talked about the trial, and the\r\nscenes of Calvary and of the garden of Siloam.\r\n\r\n19  Then Jesus said, Fear not, for I will be your boon companion all\r\nthe way; and then he disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 176.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus appears, fully materialized, to the eastern sages in the\r\n      palace of Prince Ravanna in India. To the magian priests in\r\n      Persia. The three wise men speak in praise of the personality\r\n      of the Nazarene._\r\n\r\nRavanna, prince of India, gave a feast. His palace in Orissa was the\r\nplace where men of thought from all the farther East were wont to meet.\r\n\r\n2  Ravanna was the prince with whom child Jesus went to India many\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\n3  The feast was made in honor of the wise men of the East.\r\n\r\n4  Among the guests were Meng-ste, Vidyapati and Lamaas.\r\n\r\n5  The wise men sat about the table talking of the needs of India and\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n6  The door unto the banquet hall was in the east; a vacant chair was\r\nat the table to the east.\r\n\r\n7  And as the wise men talked a stranger entered, unannounced, and\r\nraising up his hands in benediction said, All hail!\r\n\r\n8  A halo rested on his head, and light, unlike the light of sun,\r\nfilled all the room.\r\n\r\n9  The wise men rose and bowed their heads and said, All hail!\r\n\r\n10  And Jesus sat down in the vacant chair; and then the wise men knew\r\nit was the Hebrew prophet who had come.\r\n\r\n11  And Jesus said, Behold, for I am risen from the dead. Look at my\r\nhands, my feet, my side.\r\n\r\n12  The Roman soldiers pierced my hands and feet with nails; and then\r\none pierced my heart.\r\n\r\n13  They put me in a tomb, and then I wrestled with the conqueror of\r\nmen. I conquered death, I stamped upon him and arose;\r\n\r\n14  Brought immortality to light and painted on the walls of time a\r\nrainbow for the sons of men; and what I did all men shall do.\r\n\r\n15  This gospel of the resurrection of the dead is not confined to Jew\r\nand Greek; it is the heritage of every man of every time and clime;\r\nand I am here a demonstration of the power of man.\r\n\r\n16  Then he arose and pressed the hand of every man and of the royal\r\nhost, and said,\r\n\r\n17  Behold, I am not myth made of the fleeting winds, for I am flesh\r\nand bone and brawn; but I can cross the borderland at will.\r\n\r\n18  And then they talked together there a long, long time. Then Jesus\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n19  I go my way, but you shall go to all the world and preach the\r\ngospel of the omnipotence of man, the power of truth, the resurrection\r\nof the dead;\r\n\r\n20  He who believes this gospel of the son of man shall never die; the\r\ndead shall live again.\r\n\r\n21  Then Jesus disappeared, but he had sown the seed. The words of life\r\nwere spoken in Orissa, and all of India heard.\r\n\r\n22  The magian priests were in the silence in Persepolis, and Kaspar,\r\nand the magian masters who were first to greet the child of promise in\r\nthe shepherd’s home in Bethlehem, were with the priests.\r\n\r\n23  And Jesus came and sat with them; a crown of light was on his head.\r\n\r\n24  And when the silence ended Kaspar said, A master from the royal\r\ncouncil of the Silent Brotherhood is here; let us give praise.\r\n\r\n25  And all the priests and masters stood and said, All hail! What\r\nmessage from the royal council do you bring?\r\n\r\n26  And Jesus said, My brothers of the Silent Brotherhood, peace, peace\r\non earth; good will to men!\r\n\r\n27  The problem of the ages has been solved; a son of man has risen\r\nfrom the dead; has shown that human flesh can be transmuted into flesh\r\ndivine.\r\n\r\n28  Before the eyes of men this flesh in which I come to you was\r\nchanged with speed of light from human flesh. And so I am the message\r\nthat I bring to you.\r\n\r\n29  To you I come, the first of all the race to be transmuted to the\r\nimage of the AM.\r\n\r\n30  What I have done, all men will do; and what I am, all men will be.\r\n\r\n31  But Jesus said no more. In one short breath he told the story of\r\nhis mission to the sons of men, and then he disappeared.\r\n\r\n32  The magi said, Some time ago we read this promise, now fulfilled,\r\nupon the dial plate of heaven.\r\n\r\n33  And then we saw this man who has just demonstrated unto us the\r\npower of man to rise from carnal flesh and blood to flesh of God, a\r\nbabe in Bethlehem.\r\n\r\n34  And after many years he came and sat with us in these same groves;\r\n\r\n35  He told the story of his human life, of trials, sore temptations,\r\nbuffetings and woes.\r\n\r\n36  He pressed along the thorny way of life till he had risen and\r\no’erthrown the strongest foes of God and man; and he is now the only\r\nmaster of the human race whose flesh has been transmuted into flesh\r\ndivine.\r\n\r\n37  He is the God-man of today; but every one of earth shall overcome\r\nand be like him, a son of God.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 177.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus appears, fully materialized, in the temple in Jerusalem.\r\n      Rebukes the rulers of the Jews for their hypocrisy. Reveals\r\n      himself to them and they fall back in fear. He appears to the\r\n      apostles in Simon’s house. Thomas is convinced._\r\n\r\nIt was the Sabbath day and many priests and scribes and Pharisees were\r\nin the temple in Jerusalem. Caiaphas, Annas and some other ruling\r\nJews were there.\r\n\r\n2  A stranger came in garb of fisherman and asked, What has become of\r\nJesus who is called the Christ? Is he not teaching in the temple now?\r\n\r\n3  The Jews replied, That man from Galilee was crucified a week ago,\r\nbecause he was a dangerous man, a vile, seditious man.\r\n\r\n4  The stranger asked, Where did you put the body of this man from\r\nGalilee? where is his tomb?\r\n\r\n5  The Jews replied, We do not know. His followers came at night and\r\nstole the body from the tomb in which it lay and carried it away, and\r\nthen declared that he had risen from the dead.\r\n\r\n6  The stranger asked, How do you know that his disciples stole the\r\nbody from the tomb? was any one a witness of the theft?\r\n\r\n7  The Jews replied, We had a hundred soldiers at the place, and every\r\none of them declares that his disciples stole the body from the tomb.\r\n\r\n8  The stranger asked, Will any one of all your hundred men stand forth\r\nand say, I saw the body stolen from the tomb?\r\n\r\n9  The Jews replied, We do not know; these men are men of truth; we\r\ncannot doubt their word.\r\n\r\n10  The stranger said, You priests and scribes and Pharisees hear me:\r\nI was a witness of the facts, was in the garden of Siloam, and stood\r\namong your hundred men.\r\n\r\n11  And this I know that not a man among your hundred men, will say, I\r\nsaw the body stolen from the tomb.\r\n\r\n12  And I will testify before the God of heaven and earth, The body was\r\nnot stolen from the tomb; the man from Galilee is risen from the dead.\r\n\r\n13  And then the priests and scribes and Pharisees rushed up to seize\r\nthe man and cast him out.\r\n\r\n14  But instantly the fisherman became a radiant form of light, and\r\npriests and scribes and Pharisees fell back in deadly fear; they saw\r\nthe man from Galilee.\r\n\r\n15  And Jesus looked upon the frightened men and said, This is the body\r\nthat you stoned beyond the city’s gates and crucified on Calvary.\r\n\r\n16  Behold my hands, my feet, my side and see the wounds the soldiers\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n17  If you believe that I am phantom made of air, come forth and handle\r\nme; ghosts do not carry flesh and bones.\r\n\r\n18  I came to earth to demonstrate the resurrection of the dead, the\r\ntransmutation of the flesh of carnal man to flesh of man divine.\r\n\r\n19  Then Jesus raised his hands and said, Peace be to every one of you;\r\ngood will to all mankind. And then he disappeared.\r\n\r\n20  Now, Thomas had not seen the Lord since he had risen from the dead,\r\nand when the ten averred that they had seen and talked with him he\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n21  Until I see the nail prints in his hands and feet, the spear wound\r\nin his side, and talked with him as I have talked with him before, I\r\ncannot have a reason to believe that he is risen from the dead.\r\n\r\n22  At Simon’s house in Bethany the men from Galilee had met. It was\r\nthe evening of the first day of the week, and on the morrow all would\r\nturn their faces toward their homes.\r\n\r\n23  The eleven apostles all were there; the doors were closed and\r\nbarred, and Jesus came and said, Peace be to all!\r\n\r\n24  And then he said to Thomas, friend, you do not know that I have\r\nrisen from the dead; the time has come for you to know.\r\n\r\n25  Come here and see the nail prints in my hands, the spear wound in\r\nmy side, and talk with me as you have often talked with me.\r\n\r\n26  And Thomas came and saw, and then exclaimed, My master, and my\r\nLord! I do not now believe, I know that you are risen from the dead.\r\n\r\n27  And Jesus said, Because you see me you believe, and blessed are\r\nyour eyes;\r\n\r\n28  But blessed thrice are they who see me not and yet believe.\r\n\r\n29  Then Jesus vanished from their sight, but the disciples were\r\nestablished in their faith.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 178.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus appears, fully materialized, before Apollo and the\r\n      Silent Brotherhood in Greece. Appears to Claudas and Juliet\r\n      on the Tiber near Rome. Appears to the priests in the\r\n      Egyptian temple at Heliopolis._\r\n\r\nApollo, with the Silent Brotherhood of Greece, was sitting in a\r\nDelphian grove. The Oracle had spoken loud and long.\r\n\r\n2  The priests were in the sanctuary and as they looked the Oracle\r\nbecame a blaze of light; it seemed to be on fire, and all consumed.\r\n\r\n3  The priests were filled with fear. They said, A great disaster is to\r\ncome; our gods are mad; they have destroyed our Oracle.\r\n\r\n4  But when the flames had spent themselves, a man stood on the orac\r\npedestal and said;\r\n\r\n5  God speaks to man, not by an oracle of wood and gold, but by the\r\nvoice of man.\r\n\r\n6  The gods have spoken to the Greeks, and kindred tongues, through\r\nimages made by man; but God, the One, now speaks to man through Christ\r\nthe only son, who was, and is and evermore will be.\r\n\r\n7  This Oracle shall fail; the Living Oracle of God, the One, will\r\nnever fail.\r\n\r\n8  Apollo knew the man who spoke; he knew it was the Nazarene who once\r\nhad taught the wise men in the Acropolis and had rebuked the idol\r\nworshippers upon the Athen’s beach;\r\n\r\n9  And in a moment Jesus stood before Apollo and the Silent\r\nBrotherhood, and said,\r\n\r\n10  Behold, for I have risen from the dead with gifts for men. I bring\r\nto you the title of your vast estate.\r\n\r\n11  All power in heaven and earth is mine; to you I give all power in\r\nheaven and earth.\r\n\r\n12  Go forth and teach the nations of the earth the gospel of the\r\nresurrection of the dead and of eternal life through Christ, the love\r\nof God made manifest to men.\r\n\r\n13  And then he clasped Apollo’s hand and said, My human flesh was\r\nchanged to higher form by love divine and I can manifest in flesh, or\r\nin the higher planes of life, at will.\r\n\r\n14  What I can do all men can do. Go preach the gospel of the\r\nomnipotence of man.\r\n\r\n15  Then Jesus disappeared; but Greece and Crete and all the nations\r\nheard.\r\n\r\n16  Claudas and Juliet, his wife, lived on the Palatine in Rome and\r\nthey were servants of Tiberius; but they had been in Galilee;\r\n\r\n17  Had walked with Jesus by the sea, had heard his words and seen his\r\npower; and they believed that he was Christ made manifest.\r\n\r\n18  Now Claudas and his wife were on the Tiber in a little boat; a\r\nstorm swept from the sea, the boat was wrecked and Claudas and his\r\nwife were sinking down to death.\r\n\r\n19  And Jesus came and took them by the hands and said, Claudas and\r\nJuliet, arise and walk with me upon the waves.\r\n\r\n20  And they arose and walked with him upon the waves.\r\n\r\n21  A thousand people saw the three walk on the waves, and saw them\r\nreach the land, and they were all amazed.\r\n\r\n22  And Jesus said, You men of Rome, I am the resurrection and the\r\nlife. They that are dead shall live, and many that shall live will\r\nnever die.\r\n\r\n23  By mouth of gods and demigods God spoke unto your fathers long ago;\r\nbut now he speaks to you through perfect man.\r\n\r\n24  He sent his son, the Christ, in human flesh, to save the world, and\r\nas I lifted from the watery grave and saved these servants of Tiberius,\r\n\r\n25  So Christ will lift the sons and daughters of the human race, yea,\r\nevery one of them, from darkness and from graves of carnal things, to\r\nlight and everlasting life.\r\n\r\n26  I am the manifest of love raised from the dead; Behold my hands, my\r\nfeet, my side which carnal men have pierced.\r\n\r\n27  Claudas and Juliet, whom I have saved from death, are my\r\nambassadors to Rome.\r\n\r\n28  And they will point the way and preach the gospel of the Holy\r\nBreath and of the resurrection of the dead.\r\n\r\n29  And that was all he said, but Rome and all of Italy heard.\r\n\r\n30  The priests of Heliopolis were in their temple met to celebrate the\r\nresurrection of their brother Nazarite; they knew that he had risen\r\nfrom the dead.\r\n\r\n31  The Nazarite appeared and stood upon a sacred pedestal on which no\r\nman had ever stood.\r\n\r\n32  This was an honor that had been reserved for him who first would\r\ndemonstrate the resurrection of the dead.\r\n\r\n33  And Jesus was the first of all the human race to demonstrate the\r\nresurrection of the dead.\r\n\r\n34  When Jesus stood upon the sacred pedestal the masters stood and\r\nsaid, All hail! The great bells of the temple rang and all the temple\r\nwas ablaze with light.\r\n\r\n35  And Jesus said, All honor to the masters of this Temple of the Sun.\r\n\r\n36  In flesh of man there is the essence of the resurrection of the\r\ndead. This essence, quickened by the Holy Breath, will raise the\r\nsubstance of the body to a higher tone,\r\n\r\n37  And make it like the substance of the bodies of the planes above,\r\nwhich human eyes cannot behold.\r\n\r\n38  There is a holy ministry in death. The essence of the body cannot\r\nbe quickened by the Holy Breath until the fixed is solved; the body\r\nmust disintegrate, and this is death.\r\n\r\n39  And then upon these pliant substances God breathes, just as he\r\nbreathed upon the chaos of the deep when worlds were formed,\r\n\r\n40  And life springs forth from death; the carnal form is changed to\r\nform divine.\r\n\r\n41  The will of man makes possible the action of the Holy Breath. When\r\nwill of man and will of God are one, the resurrection is a fact.\r\n\r\n42  In this we have the chemistry of mortal life, the ministry of\r\ndeath, the mystery of deific life.\r\n\r\n43  My human life was wholly given to bring my will to tune with the\r\ndeific will; when this was done my earth-tasks all were done.\r\n\r\n44  And you, my brothers, know full well the foes I had to meet; you\r\nknow about my victories in Gethsemane; my trials in the courts of men;\r\nmy death upon the cross.\r\n\r\n45  You know that all my life was one great drama for the sons of men;\r\na pattern for the sons of men. I lived to show the possibilities of\r\nman.\r\n\r\n46  What I have done all men can do, and what I am all men shall be.\r\n\r\n47  The masters looked; the form upon the sacred pedestal had gone, but\r\nevery temple priest, and every living creature said, Praise God.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 179.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus appears, fully materialized, to the apostles at the\r\n      sea of Galilee. Appears to a multitude of people. Tells his\r\n      apostles to go again to Jerusalem and he would meet them\r\n      there._\r\n\r\nNow, the apostles were at home in Galilee; the women tarried in Judea\r\nuntil the Pentecost,\r\n\r\n2  And Peter, James and John, and Andrew, Philip and Nathaniel were in\r\nCapernaum. They joined with Jonah and with Zebedee, and in their boats\r\nwent out to fish,\r\n\r\n3  They toiled all night and when the morning came they had no fish.\r\n\r\n4  And as they neared the shore a man stood on the shore and said, How\r\nmany fish have you?\r\n\r\n5  And Peter answered, None.\r\n\r\n6  Again the man called out and said, A school of fish is passing now\r\nupon the right side of your boat; cast out your net.\r\n\r\n7  They cast their net, and it was filled; and John exclaimed, It is\r\nthe Lord who stands upon the shore.\r\n\r\n8  And Peter plunged into the sea and swam to shore. The other men\r\nbrought in the net, and it contained a hundred fifty and three fish\r\nand yet it did not break.\r\n\r\n9  And Jesus said, My children, let us break our fast together here.\r\n\r\n10  They found some living coals upon the beach and Peter brought and\r\ndressed the fish; they had some bread.\r\n\r\n11  And when the meal had been prepared they broke their fast, and\r\nJesus ate of both the fish and bread.\r\n\r\n12  Now, after breakfast all the men were sitting on the beach, and\r\nJesus said to Peter, Do you love the Lord your God with all your\r\nheart, and do you love your neighbor as you love yourself?\r\n\r\n13  And Peter said, Yea, Lord, I love the Lord my God with all my\r\nheart; I love my neighbor as I love myself.\r\n\r\n14  And Jesus said, Then feed my sheep.\r\n\r\n15  And then he said to James, Do you love her, the Holy Breath, with\r\nall your heart, and do you love your neighbor as you love yourself?\r\n\r\n16  And James replied, Yea, Lord, I love the Holy Breath with all my\r\nheart; I love my neighbor as I love myself.\r\n\r\n17  Then Jesus said, Protect my sheep.\r\n\r\n18  And then he said to John, Do you love Christ, the love divine made\r\nmanifest, with all your heart, and do you love your neighbor as you\r\nlove yourself?\r\n\r\n19  And John replied, Yea, Lord, I love the Christ with all my heart; I\r\nlove my neighbor as I love myself.\r\n\r\n20  And Jesus said, Then feed my lambs.\r\n\r\n21  Then Jesus rose and said to Peter, Follow me. And Peter followed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n22  When Peter saw that John was following him he said to Jesus, Lord,\r\nbehold, John follows you! What shall he do?\r\n\r\n23  Now Peter did not hear the master when he said to John, Then feed\r\nmy lambs.\r\n\r\n24  And Jesus spoke to Peter and he said, It matters not to you what\r\nJohn shall do; not even though I will that he remain until I come\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n25  Just do your duty; follow me.\r\n\r\n26  And Jesus passed, they knew not where he went.\r\n\r\n27  The news soon spread through all Capernaum that Jesus had arisen\r\nfrom the dead, that he had walked with his disciples by the sea, and\r\nate with them the morning meal. The multitudes came forth to see.\r\n\r\n28  Now Peter, James and John, together with the other men who had\r\nbeen called to be apostles of the Lord, went to the mountains near\r\nCapernaum to pray,\r\n\r\n29  And as they prayed the master came; they saw him and they talked\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n30  He said to them, The Pentecost is near at hand; go to Jerusalem and\r\nI will meet you there.\r\n\r\n31  And as he talked, a multitude of people came; they saw the Lord;\r\nthey said,\r\n\r\n32  Behold, for now we know that he, the Nazarene, has risen from the\r\ndead for we have seen him face to face.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 180.\r\n\r\n    _Jesus appears, fully materialized, to the apostles in\r\n      Jerusalem.

And then he talked\r\nwith them a long, long time.\r\n\r\n4  And the disciples asked, Will you restore the kingdom unto Israel\r\nnow?\r\n\r\n5  And Jesus said, Be not concerned about the governments of men; the\r\nmasters will direct.\r\n\r\n6  Do that which has been given you to do, and wait and murmur not.\r\n\r\n7  All power in heaven and earth is given unto me, and now I bid you go\r\nto all the world and preach the gospel of the Christ, the unity of God\r\nand man, the resurrection of the dead, and of eternal life.\r\n\r\n8  And as you go and preach, baptize the people in the name of Christ.\r\n\r\n9  They who believe and are baptized shall rise up in the newness of\r\nthe life of Christ, and they who disbelieve shall rise not in the\r\nnewness of the life of Christ.\r\n\r\n10  And you shall give to men the power I give to you.\r\n\r\n11  They who believe and are baptized shall heal the sick; shall cause\r\nthe blind to see, the deaf to hear, the lame to walk;\r\n\r\n12  Shall cast the unclean spirits out of those obsessed; shall tread\r\non deadly serpents and be not harmed; shall pass through flames and\r\nnot be burned; and if they drink a poisonous draught it shall not kill.\r\n\r\n13  You know the sacred Word, which is the word of power.\r\n\r\n14  The secret things that I have told to you that may not now be told\r\nto all the world, you shall make known to faithful men who shall in\r\nturn reveal them unto other faithful men,\r\n\r\n15  Until the time shall come when all the world may hear and\r\ncomprehend the words of truth and power.\r\n\r\n16  And now I will ascend to God, as you and all the world will rise to\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n17  Behold, upon the day of Pentecost you all shall be endowed with\r\npower from on high.\r\n\r\n18  But here you shall remain till then in holy thought and prayer.\r\n\r\n19  Then Jesus went to Olivet, and his disciples followed him, and in a\r\nplace not far removed from Bethany, he met the Marys and Salome;\r\n\r\n20  Met Martha, Ruth and Miriam; met Lazarus and a host of others who\r\nhad come from Galilee.\r\n\r\n21  And Jesus stood apart and raised his hands and said,\r\n\r\n22  The benedictions of the Holy Ones, of the Almighty God, and of the\r\nHoly Breath, of Christ the love of God made manifest,\r\n\r\n23  Will rest upon you all the way till you shall rise and sit with me\r\nupon the throne of power.\r\n\r\n24  And then they saw him rise upon the wings of light; a wreath\r\nencircled him about; and then they saw his form no more.\r\n\r\n25  But as they gazed up into heaven two men, in robes of white,\r\nappeared and said,\r\n\r\n26  You men of Galilee, why gaze you thus so anxiously upon the\r\nascending Lord? Lo, he will come again from heaven as you have seen\r\nhim go to heaven.\r\n\r\n27  Then the eleven and Lazarus, and the other men from Galilee,\r\ntogether with the faithful women, not a few, returned unto Jerusalem\r\nand there abode.\r\n\r\n28  And they were constantly in prayer and holy thought. They waited\r\nfor the Holy Breath, and for the coming of the promised power from on\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION XXII.\r\n\r\nTAU.\r\n\r\n_Establishment of the Christine Church._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 181.\r\n\r\n    _The eleven apostles make choice of Matthias to fill the place\r\n      made vacant by the deflection of Judas.

Apostolic roster._\r\n\r\nThe fact that Jesus had arisen from the dead was not denied by many of\r\nthe rulers of the Jews.\r\n\r\n2  And Pilate gave an order that the followers of the Nazarene be not\r\nmolested in their worship any place in his domain.\r\n\r\n3  The day of Pentecost was near at hand and every one was looking for\r\na manifest of Spirit power.\r\n\r\n4  Now, in Jerusalem the eleven had met to choose a man to fill the\r\nplace of Judas who betrayed his Lord.\r\n\r\n5  And Peter said, The Lord called to this ministry twelve men as\r\ntwelve foundation stones on which the Christine temple should be built.\r\n\r\n6  This Judas, who betrayed his Lord, has gone to his own place beyond\r\nthe veil.\r\n\r\n7  Of him the prophet wrote: His habitation shall be desolate; no man\r\nshall dwell therein; his office let another take.\r\n\r\n8  From those who have accompanied us from Gilgal, where the harbinger\r\nbaptized, until this day, shall one be chosen to complete the number\r\ntwelve, to fill the place from which our brother by transgression fell.\r\n\r\n9  And then the eleven spent a long, long time in prayer, and when they\r\ncast their lots, Matthias, from the valley of the Nile, was chosen for\r\nthe place.\r\n\r\n10  Matthias was an Israelite indeed; but he was learned in all the\r\nwisdom of Egyptian schools, and he had taught the mysteries of Mizraim\r\nin Jericho.\r\n\r\n11  He was among the first to greet the harbinger; among the first to\r\nrecognize the Nazarene as Christ, the son of God;\r\n\r\n12  He had been with the Christine band in all their journeys in the\r\nland of Galilee, Judea and Samaria.\r\n\r\n13  A messenger was sent who found Matthias, and he came and joined the\r\neleven, and for a time the twelve were lost in silent prayer.\r\n\r\n14  The Christines who had come from Galilee and places in Judea, about\r\nsix score, were there, and Peter told them of Matthias, and how, by\r\nlot, he had been chosen an apostle of the Lord.\r\n\r\n15  The Christines all were glad and praised the name of God; and\r\nMiriam sung a song of praise.\r\n\r\n16  These are the names of the apostles of the Lord: Peter, John and\r\nJames; Philip, Andrew and Nathaniel;\r\n\r\n17  Thomas, James the son of Alpheus and Simon Zelotes; Matthew, Jude,\r\nthe son of Alpheus and Matthias.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 182.\r\n\r\n    _Events of the day of Pentecost. Endowment of the apostles.\r\n      The Christine Church is established. Peter preaches the\r\n      introductory sermon. The sermon. Three thousand people are\r\n      baptized and become members of the church._\r\n\r\nNow, when the day of Pentecost had come Jerusalem was filled with\r\npious Jews and proselytes from many lands.\r\n\r\n2  The Christines all were met and were in perfect harmony.\r\n\r\n3  And as they sat in silent prayer they heard a sound a-like the\r\ndistant murmur of a coming storm.\r\n\r\n4  The sound grew loud, and louder still, until, like thunder peals, it\r\nfilled the room where the apostles sat.\r\n\r\n5  A brilliant light appeared, and many thought, The building is afire.\r\n\r\n6  Twelve balls, that seemed like balls of fire, fell from heaven--a\r\nball from every sign of all the circle of the heavens, and on the head\r\nof each apostle there appeared a flaming ball of fire.\r\n\r\n7  And every ball sent seven tongues of fire toward heaven, and each\r\napostle spoke in seven dialects of earth.\r\n\r\n8  The ignorant rabble treated lightly what they heard and saw; they\r\nsaid, These men are drunk, and know not what they say.\r\n\r\n9  But men of learning were amazed; they said, Are not these men who\r\nspeak all Jews? how is it that they speak in all the languages of\r\nearth?\r\n\r\n10  And Peter said, You people of Jerusalem, and you who live beyond\r\nthe city’s gates; Peace be to you, and all mankind.\r\n\r\n11  This is the time that holy men of old desired to see; by faith they\r\nsaw this hour, and now they stand with us in ecstasy.\r\n\r\n12  The prophet Joel in the olden times told of the things you see and\r\nhear. The Holy Breath spoke with his tongue and said,\r\n\r\n13  And it shall come to pass in latter days, that I will breathe upon\r\nthe sons of men, and fill them with the blessedness of holiness.\r\n\r\n14  Your sons and daughters will stand forth and prophesy; your young\r\nmen will be seers; your old men will dream dreams.\r\n\r\n15  And I will show forth wonders in the heavens above, and marvelous\r\nsigns in earth.\r\n\r\n16  Sounds will proceed from heaven and voices will be heard that men\r\nwill fail to comprehend.\r\n\r\n17  The sun will fail to shine, the moon will wade in blood before the\r\ncoming of the great day of the Lord.\r\n\r\n18  And it will come to pass that they who call upon the name of God in\r\nfaith shall be redeemed.\r\n\r\n19  This is the day of Christine power; the day that he, the man from\r\nGalilee, is glorified.\r\n\r\n20  He came as babe in Bethlehem and from his day of birth the kings of\r\nearth went forth intent to take his life.\r\n\r\n21  God held him in the hollow of his hand.\r\n\r\n22  Men called him Jesus, and they called him well, for he was sent to\r\nseek and save the lost.\r\n\r\n23  And Jesus grew to manhood and was subject unto all the trials and\r\ntemptations of the sons of men, that he might know the loads that men\r\nmust bear, and know the way to succor them.\r\n\r\n24  In distant lands he lived and by the sacred Word he healed the\r\nsick, threw prison doors ajar, and set the prisoners free, and\r\neverywhere he was proclaimed, Immanuel.\r\n\r\n25  But wicked men despised him and rejected him, and by bribed men\r\nthey proved him guilty of a score of crimes;\r\n\r\n26  And in the presence of a multitude of men who hear me now, they\r\nnailed him to a cross;\r\n\r\n27  They sealed him with the seal of death; but death was all too weak\r\nto hold him in the tomb and when immortal masters said, Adon mashich\r\ncumi, he burst the bands of death, and rose again to life.\r\n\r\n28  He showed himself alive, not only to the rulers in Jerusalem, but\r\nto the many in the distant parts of earth;\r\n\r\n29  And then, before the wondering eyes of many who now hear me speak,\r\nattended by a retinue of courtiers of the angel world, he ascended to\r\nthe throne of God.\r\n\r\n30  And being now exalted high, and having breathed to full the Holy\r\nBreath, he breathes again on us, and thus sheds forth what you now see\r\nand hear.\r\n\r\n31  You men of Israel, know that God has made this man from Galilee\r\nwhom you abused and crucified, both Lord and Christ.\r\n\r\n32  And then the people said, What shall we do?\r\n\r\n33  And Peter said, This Christine Lord has sent us forth to open up\r\nthe gates of dawn. Through Christ all men may enter into light and\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n34  The Christine Church stands on the postulates that Jesus is the\r\nlove of God made manifest; that love is savior of the sons of men.\r\n\r\n35  This Christine Church is but the kingdom of the Holy One within the\r\nsoul, made manifest.\r\n\r\n36  This day the Christine Church is opened up, and whosoever will may\r\nenter in, and, by the boundless grace of Christ, be saved.\r\n\r\n37  Again the people said, How may we enter in that we may share the\r\nboundless grace of Christ?\r\n\r\n38  And Peter said, Reform and be baptized, and turn away from sin and\r\nlead the life deep hid with Christ in God, and you shall enter in and\r\nbe redeemed.\r\n\r\n39  Three thousand people turned away from sin and were baptized and\r\nsought to lead the life deep hid with Christ in God.\r\n\r\n40  And in one day the Christine Church became a mighty power; and\r\nChrist became a mighty word that thrilled the multitudes in many lands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes:\r\n\r\n\r\nPunctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant\r\npreference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.\r\n\r\nSimple typographical errors were corrected; occasional unbalanced\r\nquotation marks retained.\r\n\r\nAmbiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained.\r\n\r\nAlphabetization errors in the Index have not been changed.\r\n\r\nText uses both “rythm” and “rhythm”; “fleshy” and “fleshly”.\r\n\r\nPage 9: Paragraph beginning “Jesus was the name of the man\" has no\r\nclosing quotation mark.\r\n\r\nPage 23: “Thankfulness of Jesus, 194” refers to a non-existent chapter.\r\nIt is possible that the correct reference would be to “104”.\r\n\r\nPage 117 Chapter 84, verse 19: comma may be missing after “astonished”.\r\n\r\nPage 126 Chapter 91, verse 34: “went his away” may be typographical\r\nerror for “way”.\r\n\r\nPage 148 Chapter 108, verse 26: “holy men-apostles” perhaps should be\r\n“holy men--apostles”.\r\n\r\nPage 158 Chapter 116, verse 2: “dualty” may be typographical error for\r\n“duality”.",
