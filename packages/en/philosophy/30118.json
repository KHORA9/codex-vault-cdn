M. of\r\nArkansas_:\r\n\r\nThis Monitor, prepared by Past Grand Master George Thornburgh,\r\nhaving been approved by the Custodians of the Work, the Grand\r\nLecturer and myself, I do recommend the use of the same to all\r\nthe lodges in Arkansas.\r\n\r\n    JOHN T. HICKS,\r\n        GRAND MASTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE AND DEDICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe demand of the craft throughout the State for a practical working\r\nMonitor of the three degrees, arranged in conformity with the work in\r\nthis jurisdiction, culminated in the adoption, by the Grand Lodge of\r\n1902, of the following resolution:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That Brother George Thornburgh be requested to prepare a\r\nMonitor which shall be adopted as the Monitor of this Grand Lodge. When\r\nthe proposed Monitor is approved by the Custodians of the Work, the\r\nGrand Lecturer, and the Grand Master, the Grand Master shall be\r\nauthorized to recommend it to the lodges.\"\r\n\r\nThis Monitor has been prepared in obedience to that resolution. The book\r\nis the child of my heart and mind. A love for the cause inspired its\r\npreparation. It goes to the craft with my earnest prayers that it may\r\ncause a more general and closer study of the beautiful ceremonies of the\r\nfirst three degrees, which are the foundation of all true Freemasonry. I\r\ndedicate the book to the Masons of Arkansas, who have so often and so\r\nkindly honored me above my merit.\r\n\r\n                                  GEO. THORNBURGH.\r\n\r\nLittle Rock, Ark, Sept. 1, 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of October, 1903, the first edition of one thousand Monitors\r\nwas placed on sale. I supposed I would probably dispose of them in the\r\ncourse of a year, but to my surprise, by December 20 they were all sold.\r\nI placed the second edition of one thousand on sale February 24, 1904,\r\nand by June 15 they were gone. Evidently the Monitor fills a long felt\r\nwant.\r\n\r\nIt was prepared especially to conform to the work in this jurisdiction.\r\nIt may be studied with profit by every Mason, whether he be an officer\r\nor not. The youngest Entered Apprentice will find it helpful and useful\r\nin assisting him to fix upon his mind those beautiful first lessons. The\r\nofficers from Master of Ceremonies to Worshipful Master will find it\r\nconvenient and indispensable in the performance correctly of the\r\nbeautiful ceremonies of the institution.\r\n\r\nI am gratified beyond expression at the cordial reception the Monitor\r\nhas received from the craft.\r\n\r\nIt is commended in the highest terms by the best workers in the State.\r\nHere are only a few of the hundreds of endorsements sent me.\r\n\r\nGrand Master Hicks: \"It is the best Monitor to be found for Arkansas\r\nMasons.\"\r\n\r\nGrand Lecturer Oathout had the manuscript sent to his home that he might\r\nvery carefully examine it, and he wrote: \"I have carefully examined the\r\nmanuscript of your Monitor twice over and cheerfully give my\r\nendorsement, believing it to be the best Monitor I have ever seen. I\r\nbelieve your work will be appreciated by the Craft in Arkansas when they\r\nexamine the Monitor.\"\r\n\r\nBrother G. W. DeVaughan, Custodian of the Secret Work: \"I am very much\r\npleased with it.\"\r\n\r\nBrother W. M. Kent, the other custodian of the Secret Work: \"Good; I\r\nwant another copy.\"\r\n\r\nOur Senior Past Grand Master G. A. Dannelly, who was so long the Grand\r\nLecturer, says: \"I have read it carefully. In my judgment it is the best\r\nMonitor I ever saw. I heartily congratulate you on being the author of\r\nsuch a book. I recommend it to all the lodges. It would be well if every\r\nmember would supply himself with a copy.\"\r\n\r\nPast Grand Master R. H. Taylor: \"I have carefully reviewed it from\r\nopening to conclusion. It is a work of great merit, concise and clear,\r\nfree and easy of style. It is not alone valuable and useful as a guide\r\nto Arkansas Masons, but to Masons everywhere. In fact if adopted by\r\nother Grand Jurisdictions, would simplify and beautify Masonic work.\r\nEvery Mason in the State should own and study the Arkansas Monitor.\"\r\n\r\nPast Grand Master Sorrells, who made the motion in Grand Lodge to have\r\nthe Monitor prepared, says: \"I have examined it closely, and feel sure\r\nthat it will meet the approbation of the Craft throughout this\r\nJurisdiction.\"\r\n\r\nPast Grand Master Bridewell: \"I have examined it and find it complete.\r\nTo a newly made Mason it is indispensable, and if every one of them\r\nwould get a copy immediately after their raising we would have brighter\r\nand better Masons. It would do a world of good if many of the older\r\nMasons would make it their 'vade mecum.' You have eliminated an immense\r\nquantity of useless matter contained in most Monitors, and that which\r\nyou placed in lieu is clear and easily understood. The chapters on\r\n'Laying Corner Stones,' 'Dedicating Lodges,' 'Funerals,' etc., will be\r\nappreciated by all who have those services to perform.\"\r\n\r\nPast Grand Master Baker: \"Have examined it carefully and am well\r\npleased. I think it conforms to the ancient usages of Masonry, and I\r\nfeel sure that by the use of it we will have many more Masons in\r\nArkansas who know something of lodge work. Every lodge ought to have at\r\nleast three copies.\"\r\n\r\nPast Grand Master Harry Myers: \"I have carefully examined your Monitor\r\nand consider it the best for our lodges possible to get. It is concise,\r\nyet comprehensive. It takes up the work and follows it in order. No\r\nlodge should be without it. I wish every Mason in the State would\r\npossess himself of this valuable addition to Masonic literature at\r\nonce.\"\r\n\r\nMay it do more and more good as its circulation increases and its\r\ninfluence widens.\r\n\r\n                                  GEORGE THORNBURGH,\r\n    July 1, 1904.                         Little Rock, Arkansas\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMASONIC MONITOR\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE DEGREES OF\r\n\r\nEntered Apprentice, Fellow Craft and Master Mason, together with the\r\nCeremony of Installation, Laying Corner Stones, Dedications, Masonic\r\nBurials, Etc., Etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPENING THE LODGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt regular meetings the lodge must be opened up in regular order and\r\nfull form from the E. A. to M. M. degree.\r\n\r\nAt special meetings it need only be opened in the degree in which work\r\nis to be done.\r\n\r\n\r\nCongregate.\r\n\r\nThe J. D. will see that the Tyler is at his station and close the door.\r\n\r\n\r\nPurge.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *\r\n\r\nOne brother can not vouch for another unless he has sat in open lodge\r\nwith him, or examined him by appointment of the W. M.\r\n\r\n\r\nTyle.\r\n\r\n\r\nOpening Prayer.\r\n\r\nMost holy and glorious Lord God, the great Architect of the universe,\r\nthe giver of all good gifts and graces! In Thy name we have assembled\r\nand in Thy name we desire to proceed in all our doings. Grant that the\r\nsublime principles of Freemasonry may so subdue every discordant passion\r\nwithin us, so harmonize and enrich our hearts with Thine own love and\r\ngoodness, that the Lodge at this time may humbly reflect that order and\r\nbeauty which reign forever before Thy throne! Amen!\r\n\r\nResponse: So mote it be!\r\n\r\nOr,\r\n\r\nAlmighty and merciful God, hear us with indulgence, have pity for our\r\nweakness, and aid us with Thy strength. Help us to perform all our\r\nduties--to ourselves, to other men, and to Thee. Let the great flood of\r\nMasonic light flow over the world. Pardon us when we offend. When we go\r\nastray, lead us back to the true path; and help our feeble efforts to\r\nremove all obstacles to the final triumph of the great law of love; and,\r\nhaving faithfully performed our duty here below, wilt Thou receive us\r\ninto Thy Celestial Lodge above, that house not made with hands, eternal\r\nin the heavens. Amen!\r\n\r\nResponse: So mote it be!\r\n\r\n\r\nClosing Prayer.\r\n\r\nExtemporaneous, or the following:\r\n\r\nSupreme Architect of the Universe, accept our hearty thanks for the many\r\nmercies and blessings which Thy bounty has conferred upon us, and\r\nespecially for this social intercourse with our brethren. Pardon, we\r\nbeseech Thee, whatever Thou has seen amiss in us, and continue to us Thy\r\nprotection and blessing. Make us sensible of our obligations to serve\r\nThee, and may all our actions tend to Thy glory and our advancement in\r\nknowledge and virtue. Grant that the world--the little circle in which\r\nwe move--may be better and happier for our having lived in it, and may\r\nwe practice that Charity which is the bond of peace and the perfection\r\nof every virtue. Amen!\r\n\r\nResponse: So mote it be!\r\n\r\nThis charge may be used at closing:\r\n\r\nBrethren: We are now about to quit this sacred retreat of friendship and\r\nvirtue to mix again with the world. Amidst its concerns and employments,\r\nforget not the duties which you have heard so frequently inculcated and\r\nso forcibly, recommended in this lodge. Be diligent, prudent, temperate,\r\ndiscreet. Remember that around this altar you have promised to befriend\r\nand relieve every brother who shall need your assistance. You have\r\npromised, in the most friendly manner, to remind him of his errors and\r\nto aid his reformation. These generous principles are to extend further:\r\nEvery human being has a claim upon your kind offices. Do good unto all.\r\nRecommend it more especially to the \"household of the faithful.\"\r\nFinally, brethren, be ye all of one mind; live in peace; and may the God\r\nof Love and Peace delight to dwell with and bless you. Amen!\r\n\r\nResponse: So mote it be!\r\n\r\n\r\nBenediction.\r\n\r\n\r\nMay the blessing of heaven rest upon us and all regular Masons! May\r\nbrotherly love prevail and every moral and social virtue cement us.\r\nAmen!\r\n\r\nResponse: So mote it be!\r\n\r\n    W. M.--\"Brother S. W., how should Masons meet?\"\r\n\r\n    S. W.--\"Upon the level of equality.\"\r\n\r\n    W. M.--\"Brother J. W., how act?\"\r\n\r\n    J. W.--\"Upon the plumb of rectitude.\"\r\n\r\n    W. M.--\"And part upon the square of morality. So may we ever\r\n    meet, act and part, until we meet in the celestial lodge above.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENTERED APPRENTICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nS. D.: Mr. ----, we have learned from the declaration, over your\r\nsignature, contained in your petition, somewhat of your motives in\r\napplying for admission into our ancient and honorable Fraternity; but,\r\nin order that you may not be misled as to the character or the purpose\r\nof the ceremonies in which you are about to engage, the Lodge addresses\r\nto you these preliminary words:\r\n\r\nFreemasonry is far removed from all that is trivial, selfish and\r\nungodly. Its structure is built upon the everlasting foundation of that\r\nGod-given law--the Brotherhood of Man, in the family whose Father is\r\nGod. Our ancient and honorable Fraternity welcomes to its doors and\r\nadmits to its privileges worthy men of all creeds and of every race, but\r\ninsists that all men shall stand upon an exact equality, and receive its\r\ninstructions in a spirit of due humility, emphasizing in demeanor, in\r\nconduct, in ceremony and in language the helpless, groping nature of man\r\nat his birth and his needs of reliance upon Divine guidance through all\r\nthe transactions of life. You will here be taught to divest your mind\r\nand conscience of all the vices and superfluities of life, and the Lodge\r\ninto which you are now to be admitted expects you to divest yourself of\r\nall those worldly distinctions and equipments which are not in keeping\r\nwith the humble, reverent and childlike attitude it is now your duty to\r\nassume, as all have done who have gone this way before you.\r\n\r\n(Every candidate, previous to his reception, is required to give his\r\nfree and full assent to the following interrogatories propounded by the\r\nS. D., in a room adjacent to the Lodge).\r\n\r\nDo you seriously declare, upon your honor, that, unbiased by the\r\nimproper solicitation of friends, and uninfluenced by mercenary motives,\r\nyou freely and voluntarily offer yourself a candidate for the mysteries\r\nof Freemasonry?\r\n\r\nDo you seriously declare, upon your honor, that you are prompted to\r\nsolicit the privileges of Freemasonry by a favorable opinion conceived\r\nof the institution, a desire for knowledge, and a sincere wish of being\r\nserviceable to your fellow-creatures?\r\n\r\nDo you seriously declare, upon your honor, that you will cheerfully\r\nconform to all the ancient usages and established customs of the\r\nFraternity?\r\n\r\n(Let there be no levity--but dignity and decorum.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST SECTION.\r\n\r\n    The preparation to which the candidate must submit before\r\n    entering the Lodge serves allegorically to teach him, as well as\r\n    to remind the brethren who are present, that it is the man\r\n    alone, divested of all the outward recommendations of rank,\r\n    state, or riches, that Masonry accepts, and that it is his\r\n    spiritual and moral worth alone which can open for him the door\r\n    of the Masonic Temple.\r\n\r\n\r\nReception.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    *    *    *\r\n\r\n    Let no man enter upon any great or important undertaking without\r\n    first invoking the aid of Deity.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\nPrayer.\r\n\r\nVouchsafe Thine aid, Almighty Father of the Universe, to this our\r\npresent convention; and grant that this candidate for Masonry may\r\ndedicate and devote his life to Thy service, and become a true and\r\nfaithful brother among us. Endue him with a competency of Thy divine\r\nwisdom, that by the influence of the pure principles of our Fraternity\r\nhe may be better enabled to display the beauties of holiness, to the\r\nhonor of Thy holy name. Amen!\r\n\r\nResponse: So mote it be!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRUST in GOD.]\r\n\r\nBehold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together\r\nin unity.\r\n\r\nIt is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the\r\nbeard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments.\r\n\r\nAs the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains\r\nof Zion: for there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for\r\nevermore.--133d Psalm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the\r\n    earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the\r\n    face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of\r\n    the waters. And God said, Let there be light, and there was\r\n    light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    The three Great Lights in Masonry are the Holy Bible, the Square\r\n    and the Compasses, and are thus explained:\r\n\r\n    The Holy Bible is given us as the rule and guide for our faith\r\n    and practice, the Square to square our actions, and the\r\n    Compasses to circumscribe our desires and keep our passions in\r\n    due bounds with all mankind, especially the brethren.\r\n\r\n    The three Lesser Lights are the Sun, Moon and Master of the\r\n    Lodge, and are thus explained:\r\n\r\n    As the Sun rules the day and the Moon governs the night, so\r\n    should the Worshipful Master, with equal regularity, endeavor to\r\n    rule and govern the Lodge.\r\n\r\n    The Representatives of the three Lesser Lights are three burning\r\n    tapers, placed in a triangular form about the altar.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n=The Lamb-Skin or White Leathern Apron= is an emblem of innocence\r\nand the badge of a Mason; more ancient than the Golden Fleece; more\r\nhonorable than the Star and Garter, or any other order that can be\r\nconferred upon you at this or any future period by King, Prince or\r\nPotentate, or any other person except he be a Mason and in the body\r\nof a lodge. I trust you will wear it with equal pleasure to yourself\r\nand honor to the fraternity.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *\r\n\r\nThe following may be used:\r\n\r\nIt may be that, in the coming years, upon your head may rest the laurel\r\nwreaths of victory; pendant from your breast may hang jewels fit to\r\ngrace the diadem of an Eastern potentate; nay, more than these, with\r\nlight added to the coming light, your ambitious feet may tread round\r\nafter round of the ladder that leads to fame in our mystic circle, and\r\neven the purple of the Fraternity may rest upon your honored shoulders;\r\nbut never again from mortal hands, never again until your enfranchised\r\nspirit shall have passed upward and inward through the pearly gates,\r\nshall any honor so distinguished, so emblematical of purity and all\r\nperfections, be conferred upon you as this which I now bestow. It is\r\nyours; yours to wear throughout an honorable life, and at your death to\r\nbe deposited upon the coffin which shall inclose your lifeless remains,\r\nand with them laid beneath the clods of the valley.\r\n\r\nLet its pure and spotless surface be to you an ever-present reminder of\r\na \"purity of life and rectitude of conduct,\" a never-ending argument for\r\nnobler deeds, for higher thoughts, for greater achievements. And when at\r\nlast your weary feet shall have come to the end of life's toilsome\r\njourney, and from your nerveless grasp shall drop forever the working\r\ntools of life, may the record of your life and actions be as pure and\r\nspotless as this fair emblem which I place in your hands; and when your\r\ntrembling soul shall stand naked and alone before the Great White\r\nThrone, there to receive judgment for the deeds done while here in the\r\nbody, may it be your portion to hear from Him who sitteth as the Judge\r\nSupreme the welcome words: \"Well done, good and faithful servant! Thou\r\nhast been faithful over a few things; I will make thee ruler over many\r\nthings! Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\"\r\n\r\n    *    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\nWorking Tools.\r\n\r\nThe Working Tools of Entered Apprentice are the Twenty-four-Inch Gauge\r\nand the Common Gavel.\r\n\r\nThe Twenty-four-inch Gauge is an instrument used by operative masons to\r\nmeasure and lay out their work; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are\r\ntaught to use it for the more noble and glorious purpose of dividing our\r\ntime. It being divided into twenty-four equal parts, is emblematical of\r\nthe twenty-four hours of the day, which we are taught to divide into\r\nthree equal parts, whereby are found eight hours for the service of God\r\nand a distressed worthy brother, eight for our usual vocations, and\r\neight for refreshment and sleep.\r\n\r\nThe Common Gavel is an instrument used by operative masons to break off\r\nthe corners of rough stones, the better to fit them for the builder's\r\nuse; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to use it for the\r\nmore noble and glorious purpose of divesting our hearts and consciences\r\nof all the vices and superfluities of life, thereby fitting our minds,\r\nas living stones, for that spiritual building--that house not made with\r\nhands--eternal in the heavens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    *    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\nReinvested.\r\n\r\n\r\nNortheast Corner.\r\n\r\n* * * an upright man and Mason, and I give it you strictly in charge\r\never to walk and act as such before God and man.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND SECTION.\r\n\r\nThis section accounts, rationally for the ceremonies of initiation.\r\nContaining almost entirely esoteric work, it cannot be written. The\r\nMaster should not only familiarize himself with it, but he should also\r\ndiligently learn and explain to the candidate each truth symbolized by\r\neach step of the ceremonies through which he has just passed.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\nOffensive or Defensive.\r\n\r\nAt the building of King Solomon's Temple there was not heard the sound\r\nof axe, hammer or any tool of iron. The question naturally arises, How\r\ncould so stupendous an edifice be erected without the aid of those\r\nimplements? The stones were hewn, squared and numbered in the quarries\r\nwhere they were raised; the timbers were felled and prepared in the\r\nforests of Lebanon, conveyed in floats by sea to Joppa, and thence by\r\nland to Jerusalem, where they were set up by the aid of wooden\r\nimplements prepared for that purpose; so that every part of the\r\nbuilding, when completed, fitted with such exact nicety that it\r\nresembled the handiwork of the Supreme Architect of the Universe more\r\nthan that of human hands.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *\r\n\r\nMasonry regards no man for his worldly wealth or honors; it is therefore\r\nthe internal and not the external qualifications of the man that\r\nrecommend him to become a Mason.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the fourth chapter of the book of Ruth we read: \"Now this was the\r\nmanner in former times concerning redeeming and changing; for to confirm\r\nall things, a man plucked off his shoe and gave it to his neighbor; and\r\nthis was a testimony in Israel.\" * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nCable----.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\nHood----.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\nK--no--ks.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *\r\n\r\n\"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock and it\r\nshall be opened unto you.\"\r\n\r\n    *    *    *\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon any great or important undertaking, we ought always\r\nto invoke the aid of Deity.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\nTrust in God.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Left Side.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *\r\n\r\nThe Right Hand, by our ancient brethren, was deemed the seat of\r\nfidelity. The ancients worshiped a deity named Fides, sometimes\r\nrepresented by two right hands joined, at others by two human figures\r\nholding each other by the right hand.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lamb has in all ages been deemed an emblem of innocence. The\r\nlambskin is therefore to remind you of that purity of life and conduct\r\nwhich is so essentially necessary to your gaining admission to the\r\nCelestial Lodge above, where the Supreme Architect of the Universe\r\npresides.\r\n\r\n\r\nNortheast Corner.\r\n\r\nIt is customary at the erection of all Masonic edifices to lay the first\r\nor foundation stone in the northeast corner of the building. The first\r\ninstructions which the candidate receives symbolizes the cornerstone,\r\nand on it he constructs the moral and Masonic temple of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD SECTION.\r\n\r\nThis section explains the manner of constituting and the proper\r\nauthority for holding a Lodge. Here, also, we learn where lodges were\r\nanciently held, their Form, Support, Covering, Furniture, Ornaments,\r\nLights and Jewels, how situated, and to whom dedicated, as well in\r\nformer times as at present.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Lodge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA Lodge is an assemblage of Masons, duly congregated, having Holy Bible,\r\nSquare and Compasses, and a dispensation or charter, authorizing them to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\nAncient Lodges--Where Held.\r\n\r\nOur ancient brethren held their Lodges on high hills or in low vales,\r\nthe better to observe the approach of cowans and eavesdroppers,\r\nascending or descending.\r\n\r\nLodge meetings at the present day are usually held in upper\r\nchambers--probably for the security which such places afford. This\r\ncustom may have had its origin in a practice observed by the ancient\r\nJews of building their temples, schools and synagogues on high hills, a\r\npractice which seems to have met the approbation of the Almighty, who\r\nsaid unto the Prophet Ezekiel, \"Upon the top of the mountain, the whole\r\nlimit thereof round about shall be most holy.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nForm and Dimension.\r\n\r\nIts form is * * * Its dimension, from east to west, embracing every\r\nclime between north and south. Its universal chain of friendship\r\nencircles every portion of the human family and beams wherever\r\ncivilization extends.\r\n\r\nA Lodge is said to be thus extensive to denote the universality of\r\nFreemasonry, and teaches that a Mason's charity should be equally\r\nextensive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W. S. B.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supports of a Lodge.\r\n\r\nA Lodge is supported by three great pillars, denominated Wisdom,\r\nStrength and Beauty; because there should be wisdom to contrive,\r\nstrength to support, and beauty to adorn all great and important\r\nundertakings. They are represented by the three principal officers of\r\nthe Lodge: The pillar Wisdom, by the W. M. in the East, who is presumed\r\nto have wisdom to open and govern the Lodge; the pillar Strength, by the\r\nSenior Warden in the West, whose duty it is to assist the W. M. in the\r\ndischarge of his arduous labors; and the pillar Beauty, by the Junior\r\nWarden in the South, whose duty it is to call the craft from labor to\r\nrefreshment, superintend them during the hours thereof, carefully to\r\nobserve that the means of refreshment are not perverted to intemperance\r\nor excess, and see that they return to their labor in due season.\r\n\r\nIts covering is no less than the clouded canopy or starry-decked heaven,\r\nwhere all good Masons hope at last to arrive, by the aid of that\r\ntheological ladder which Jacob, in his vision, saw extending from earth\r\nto heaven; the three principal rounds of which are denominated Faith,\r\nHope and Charity; which admonish us to have faith in God, hope of\r\nimmortality and charity to all mankind. The greatest of these is\r\nCharity; for Faith may be lost in sight, Hope ends in fruition, but\r\nCharity extends beyond the grave through the boundless realms of\r\neternity.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurniture.\r\n\r\nThe furniture of a lodge consists of the Holy Bible, Square and\r\nCompasses.\r\n\r\nThe Holy Bible is dedicated to God; because it is the inestimable gift\r\nof God to man. The Square to the Master, because it is the proper\r\nMasonic emblem of his office; and the Compasses to the craft, because,\r\nby a due attention to their use, they are taught to circumscribe their\r\ndesires, and keep their passions within due bounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nOrnaments.\r\n\r\nThe Ornaments of a Lodge are the Mosaic Pavement, the Indented Tessel\r\nand the Blazing Star.\r\n\r\nThe Mosaic Pavement is a representation of the ground floor of King\r\nSolomon's Temple; the Indented Tessel, of that beautiful tessellated\r\nborder or skirting which surrounded it. The Mosaic Pavement is\r\nemblematical of human life, checkered with good and evil; the Indented\r\nTessel, or tessellated border, of the manifold blessings and comforts\r\nwhich constantly surround us, and which we hope to enjoy by a firm\r\nreliance on Divine Providence, which is hieroglyphically represented by\r\nthe Blazing Star in the centre.\r\n\r\n\r\nLights.\r\n\r\nA Lodge has three symbolic lights; one in the East, one in the West and\r\none in the South, represented by the W. M., S. W. and J. W. There is no\r\nlight in the north, because King Solomon's Temple, of which every lodge\r\nis a representation, was so far north of the elliptic that the sun could\r\ndart no rays into the northern part thereof. The north, therefore, we\r\nMasonically call a place of darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\nJewels.\r\n\r\nA Lodge has six jewels; three of these are immovable and three movable.\r\n\r\nThe Immovable Jewels are the Square, Level and Plumb. The Square\r\ninculcates morality; the Level, equality, and the Plumb, rectitude of\r\nconduct. They are called immovable jewels, because they are always to be\r\nfound in the East, West and South parts of the Lodge, being worn by the\r\nofficers in their respective stations.\r\n\r\nThe Movable Jewels are the Rough Ashlar, the Perfect Ashlar and the\r\nTrestle-Board.\r\n\r\nThe Rough Ashlar is a stone, as taken from the quarry, in its rude and\r\nnatural state. By it we are reminded of our rude and imperfect state by\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nThe Perfect Ashlar is a stone made ready by the hands of the workmen, to\r\nbe adjusted by the working tools of the fellow craft; and reminds us of\r\nthat state of perfection at which we hope to arrive by a virtuous\r\neducation, our own endeavors and the blessing of God.\r\n\r\nThe Trestle-Board is for the master workman to draw his designs upon. By\r\nit we are reminded that, as the operative workman erects his temporal\r\nbuilding agreeably to the rules and designs laid down by the master on\r\nhis trestle-board, so should we, both operative and speculative,\r\nendeavor to erect our spiritual building agreeably to the rules and\r\ndesigns laid down by the Supreme Architect of the Universe, in the great\r\nbooks of nature and revelation, which are our spiritual, moral and\r\nMasonic trestle-boards.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Situated.\r\n\r\nA Lodge is situated due east and west, because King Solomon's Temple was\r\nso situated; and also because, when Moses crossed the Red Sea, being\r\npursued by Pharaoh and his hosts, he erected a Tabernacle by Divine\r\ncommand, and placed it due east and west to receive the first rays of\r\nthe rising sun, and to commemorate that mighty east wind by which the\r\nmiraculous deliverance of Israel was effected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nDedication of Lodges.\r\n\r\nOur ancient brethren dedicated their lodges to King Solomon because he\r\nwas our first most excellent Grand Master, but Masons of the present\r\nday, professing Christianity, dedicate theirs to St. John the Baptist\r\nand St. John the Evangelist, who were two eminent patrons of Masonry;\r\nand since their time there is represented in every regular and well\r\ngovern lodge a certain point within a circle embordered by two\r\nperpendicular parallel lines, representing St. John the Baptist and St.\r\nJohn the Evangelist; and upon the top rests the Holy Scriptures. The\r\npoint represents the individual brother; the circle, the boundary-line\r\nof his duty beyond which he is never to suffer his passions, interests\r\nor prejudices to betray him. In going around this circle we necessarily\r\ntouch on the two parallel lines, as well as the Holy Scriptures, and\r\nwhile a Mason keeps himself circumscribed within these due bounds, it is\r\nimpossible that he should materially err.\r\n\r\n\r\nTenets.\r\n\r\nThe three great tenets of a Mason's profession inculcate the practice of\r\nthose commendable virtues, Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth.\r\n\r\nBrotherly Love.--By the exercise of brotherly love we are taught to\r\nregard the whole human species as one family--the high and low, the rich\r\nand poor--who, created by one Almighty Parent and inhabitants of the\r\nsame planet, are to aid and protect each other. On this principle\r\nMasonry unites men of every country, sect and opinion, and conciliates\r\ntrue friendship among those who might otherwise have remained at a\r\nperpetual distance.\r\n\r\nRelief.--To relieve the distressed is a duty incumbent on all men, but\r\nparticularly on Masons who profess to be linked together by an\r\nindissoluble chain of sincere affection. To soothe the unhappy, to\r\nsympathize with their misfortunes, to compassionate their miseries and\r\nto restore peace to their troubled minds, is the great aim we have in\r\nview. On this basis we form our friendships and establish our\r\nconnections.\r\n\r\nTruth is a divine attribute, and the foundation of every virtue. To be\r\ngood and true is the first lesson we are taught in Masonry. On this\r\ntheme we contemplate, and by its dictates endeavor to regulate our\r\nconduct; hence, while influenced by this principle, hypocrisy and deceit\r\nare unknown among us; sincerity and plain-dealing distinguish us, and\r\nthe heart and tongue join in promoting each other's welfare and\r\nrejoicing in each other's prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\nP. P. E.\r\n\r\nEvery Mason has four (p. p. e.) which are illustrated by the four\r\ncardinal virtues: Fortitude, Prudence, Temperance and Justice.\r\n\r\nFortitude is that noble and steady purpose of the mind whereby we are\r\nenabled to undergo any pain or peril, when prudentially deemed\r\nexpedient. This virtue is equally distant from rashness and cowardice,\r\nand should be deeply impressed upon the mind of every Mason. It is a\r\nsafeguard or security against the success of any attempt, by force or\r\notherwise, to extort from him any of those valuable secrets with which\r\nhe has been solemnly intrusted, and which were emblematically impressed\r\nupon him on his first admission into the lodge, when he was received on\r\n* * * which refers to * * *\r\n\r\nPrudence teaches us to regulate our lives and actions agreeably to the\r\ndictates of reason, and is that habit by which we wisely judge and\r\nprudentially determine on all things relative to our present as well as\r\nto our future happiness. This virtue should be the peculiar\r\ncharacteristic of every Mason, not only for the government of his\r\nconduct while in the lodge, but also when abroad in the world. It should\r\nbe his constant care, when in any strange or mixed companies never to\r\nlet fall the least sign, token or word whereby the secrets of Masonry\r\nmight be unlawfully obtained; ever bearing in mind that important\r\noccasion when on his left * * * which alludes to * * *\r\n\r\nTemperance is that due restraint upon our affections and passions which\r\nrenders the body tame and governable, and frees the mind from the\r\nallurements of vice. This virtue should be the constant practice of\r\nevery Mason; as he is thereby taught to avoid excess, or contracting any\r\nlicentious or vicious habit, the indulgence of which would subject him\r\nto the contempt and detestation of all good Masons; and might lead him\r\nto disclose some of those valuable secrets which he has promised to\r\nconceal and never reveal. It will remind you of the p. and alludes to\r\nthe * * *\r\n\r\nJustice is that standard, or boundary of right, which enables us to\r\nrender to every man his just due, without distinction. This virtue is\r\nnot only consistent with human and Divine laws, but is the very cement\r\nand support of civil society. As justice in a great measure constitutes\r\nthe really good man, so should it be the invariable practice of every\r\nMason never to deviate from the minutest principles thereof; ever\r\nremembering the time when placed in * * * which alludes to the * * *\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nChalk, Charcoal and Clay.\r\n\r\nEntered Apprentices should serve their masters with freedom, fervency\r\nand zeal, which are represented by Chalk, Charcoal and Clay.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing freer than Chalk, the slightest touch of which leaves a\r\ntrace; there is nothing more fervent than Charcoal, for to it, when\r\nproperly ignited, the most obdurate metals will yield; there is nothing\r\nmore zealous than Clay.\r\n\r\nOur Mother Earth alone of all the elements has never proved unfriendly\r\nto man. Bodies of Water deluge him with rain, oppress him with hail and\r\ndrown him with inundation; the Air rushes in storms and prepares the\r\ntempest; and Fire lights up the volcano; but the Earth, ever kind and\r\nindulgent, is found subservient to his wishes. Though constantly\r\nharassed, more to furnish the luxuries than the necessaries of life, she\r\nnever refuses her accustomed yield, spreading his pathway with flowers\r\nand his table with plenty. Though she produces poison, still she\r\nsupplies the antidote, and returns with interest every good committed to\r\nher care; and when at last we are called upon to pass through the \"dark\r\nvalley of the shadow of death\" she once more receives us, and piously\r\ncovers our remains within her bosom, thus admonishing us that as from it\r\nwe came, so to it we must shortly return.\r\n\r\n\r\nSymbolism of the Degree.\r\n\r\nThe First, or Entered Apprentice, degree of Masonry is intended,\r\nsymbolically, to represent the entrance of man into the world in which\r\nhe is afterwards to become a living and thinking actor. Coming from the\r\nignorance and darkness of the outer world, his first craving is for\r\nlight--not that physical light which springs from the great orb of day\r\nas its fountain, but that moral and intellectual light which emanates\r\nfrom the primal Source of all things--from the Grand Architect of the\r\nUniverse--the Creator of the sun and of all that it illuminates. Hence\r\nthe great, the primary object of the first degree is to symbolize the\r\nbirth of intellectual light in the mind; and the Entered Apprentice is\r\nthe type of the unregenerate man, groping in moral and mental darkness,\r\nand seeking for the light which is to guide his steps and point him to\r\nthe path which leads to duty and to Him who gives to duty its reward.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharge at Initiation.\r\n\r\nBrother: As you are now introduced to the first principles of\r\nFreemasonry, I congratulate you on being accepted into this ancient and\r\nhonorable Fraternity. Ancient, as having existed from time immemorial;\r\nand honorable, as tending in every particular so to render all men who\r\nwill be comformable to its precepts. No institution was ever raised on a\r\nbetter principle or more solid foundation; nor were ever more excellent\r\nrules and useful maxims laid down than are contained in the several\r\nMasonic lectures. The wisest and best of men in all ages have been\r\nencouragers and promoters of our Art, and have never deemed it\r\nderogatory to their dignity to level themselves with the Fraternity, to\r\nextend its privileges, and to patronize its assemblies.\r\n\r\nThere are three great duties which as a Mason you are charged to\r\ninculcate: To God, to your neighbor and to yourself. To God, in never\r\nmentioning His name save with that reverential awe which is due from the\r\ncreature to his Creator, to implore His aid in all your laudable\r\nundertakings, and to esteem Him as the chief good. To your neighbor, in\r\nacting upon the square and doing unto him as you would that he should do\r\nunto you. And to yourself, in avoiding all irregularities and\r\nintemperance, which may impair your faculties or debase the dignity of\r\nyour profession.\r\n\r\nA zealous attachment to these duties will insure public and private\r\nesteem.\r\n\r\nIn the State you are to be a quiet and peaceable citizen, true to your\r\ngovernment and just to your country. You are not to countenance\r\ndisloyalty or rebellion, but patiently submit to legal authority and\r\nconform with cheerfulness to the government of the country in which you\r\nlive, yielding obedience to the laws which afford you protection.\r\n\r\nIn your outward demeanor be particularly careful to avoid censure or\r\nreproach. Let not interest, favor, or prejudice, bias your integrity, or\r\ninfluence you to be guilty of a dishonorable action.\r\n\r\nAlthough your frequent appearance at our regular meetings is earnestly\r\nsolicited, yet it is not meant that Freemasonry should interfere with\r\nyour necessary vocations, for these are on no account to be neglected;\r\nneither are you to suffer your zeal for the institution to lead you into\r\nargument with those who, through ignorance, may ridicule it.\r\n\r\nAt your leisure hours, that you may improve in Masonic knowledge, you\r\nare to converse with well-informed brethren, who will always be as ready\r\nto give as you will be to receive instruction.\r\n\r\nFinally, my brother, keep sacred and inviolate the mysteries of the\r\nOrder, as these are to distinguish you from the rest of the community\r\nand mark your consequence among Masons.\r\n\r\nIf in the circle of your acquaintance you find a person desirous of\r\nbeing initiated into the Fraternity, be particularly careful not to\r\nrecommend him unless you are convinced that he will conform to our\r\nrules, that the honor, glory and reputation of the institution may be\r\nfirmly established, and the world at large be convinced of its good\r\neffects.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharge to a Soldier.\r\n\r\nBrother: Our institution breathes a spirit of general philanthropy. Its\r\nbenefits, in a social point of view, are extensive. In the most\r\nendearing ties, it unites all mankind. In every nation, wherever\r\ncivilization extends--and not unfrequently among wild savages of the\r\nforest--it opens an asylum to a brother in distress, and grants\r\nhospitality to the necessitous and unfortunate. The sublime principles\r\nof universal goodness and love to all mankind, which are essential to\r\nit, cannot be lost in national distinctions, prejudices and animosities.\r\nThe rage of contest and the sanguinary conflict have, by its recognized\r\nprinciples, been abated, and the milder emotions of humanity\r\nsubstituted. It has often performed the part of the Angel of Goodness,\r\nin ministering to the wants of the sick, the wounded, and the\r\nunfortunate prisoner of war. It has even taught the pride of victory to\r\ngive way to the dictates of an honorable connection.\r\n\r\nIn whatever country you travel, when you meet a true Mason, you will\r\nfind a brother and a friend, who will do all in his power to serve you;\r\nand who will relieve you, should you be poor or in distress, to the\r\nutmost of his ability, and with a ready cheerfulness.\r\n\r\nPure patriotism will always animate you to every call of your country.\r\nAnd this institution demands that you shall be true to your government.\r\nBut should you, while engaged in the service of your country, be made\r\ncaptive, you may find affectionate brethren, where others would only\r\nfind enemies. And should you be the captor of one who belongs to this\r\nnoble fraternity, remember that he is your brother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFELLOW CRAFT.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst Section--Reception.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThus he shewed me: and behold the Lord stood upon a wall made by a\r\nplumb-line, with a plumb-line in His hand.\r\n\r\nAnd the Lord said unto me: Amos, what seest thou? and I said, A\r\nplumb-line. Then said the Lord: Behold, I will set a plumb-line in the\r\nmidst of my people Israel;\r\n\r\nI will not again pass by them any more. Amos, vii. 7, 8.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Working Tools.\r\n\r\nThe Working Tools of Fellow Craft are the Plumb, the Square and the\r\nLevel, and are thus explained:\r\n\r\nThe Plumb is an instrument used by Operative Masons to try\r\nperpendiculars, the Square to square their work, and the Level to prove\r\nhorizontals; but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to use them\r\nfor more noble and glorious purposes. The Plumb admonishes us to walk\r\nuprightly in our several stations before God and man, squaring our\r\nactions by the Square of Virtue, ever remembering that we are traveling\r\nupon the Level of Time to that \"undiscovered country from whose bourne\r\nno traveler returns.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND SECTION.\r\n\r\nYou now represent a young F. C. on his way to the M. C. of K. S. T., to\r\nhave his name enrolled among the workmen, and to be taught the wages of\r\na F. C. Masonry is divided into two classes, operative and speculative.\r\nWe have wrought in speculative Masonry, but our ancient brethren wrought\r\nboth in operative and speculative. They wrought at the building of K. S.\r\nT., and many other Masonic edifices. They wrought but six days in a\r\nweek, and rested upon the seventh. The seventh, therefore, our ancient\r\nbrethren consecrated as a day of rest, the better to enable them to\r\ncontemplate the glorious works of creation and to adore their great\r\nCreator.\r\n\r\nOn our way to the M. C. the first things that attract our attention are\r\nthe representatives of two brazen pillars, one upon the left, the other\r\nupon the right of the porch. The one upon the left, denominated * * *\r\ndenoted strength; the one upon the right, denominated * * * denoted\r\nestablishment, having reference to a passage of Scripture wherein God\r\nsaid to David, \"And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established\r\nforever before thee.\"\r\n\r\nThose pillars were eighteen cubits high, twelve in circumference and\r\nfour in diameter. They were prepared of molten brass, the better to\r\nwithstand conflagration or inundation. They were cast in the clay\r\ngrounds of the river Jordan, between Succoth and Zaradatha, where K. S.\r\nordered all the holy vessels to be cast. They were hollow, four inches,\r\nor a hand's breadth, in thickness, and served as the archives of Masonry\r\nin which the Rolls, Records and Proceedings were kept. They were adorned\r\nwith two chapiters, five cubits each. Those chapiters were ornamented\r\nwith net-work, lily-work and pomegranate, denoting union, peace and\r\nplenty. The net-work, from its intimate connection, denotes union. The\r\nlily, from its whiteness, denotes peace. The pomegranate, from the\r\nexuberance of its seeds, denotes plenty. Mounted upon the chapiters were\r\ntwo globes, representing the terrestrial and celestial bodies, on the\r\nconvex surface of which were delineated the countries, seas and other\r\nportions of the earth, the planetary revolutions and other important\r\nparticulars. They represented the universality of Freemasonry--that from\r\neast to west and between north and south Freemasonry extends, and in\r\nevery clime are Masons to be found, and teach that a Mason's charity\r\nshould be co-extensive.\r\n\r\nMasonic tradition informs us that those pillars were placed at the porch\r\nof K. S.'s T. as a memento to the children of Israel of their happy\r\ndeliverance from the land of bondage, and represented the pillar of\r\ncloud that over-shadowed them by day and the pillar of fire that\r\nillumined them by night.\r\n\r\nThe next thing that attracts our attention is a flight of winding\r\nstairs, composed of three, five and seven steps. The three steps allude\r\nto the three principal officers of the lodge, three principal supports\r\nin Masonry, and the three principal stages in human life. The three\r\nprincipal officers are the W. M., S. W. and J. W. The three principal\r\nsupports are Wisdom, Strength and Beauty, because it is necessary to\r\nhave wisdom to contrive, strength to support and beauty to adorn all\r\nwell governed institutions. The three principal stages of human life are\r\nYouth, Manhood and Age--Youth as an E. A., Manhood as a F. C., and Age\r\nas a M. M.\r\n\r\nThe five steps allude to the five orders of architecture, and the five\r\nhuman senses. The five orders of architecture are the Tuscan, Doric,\r\nIonic, Corinthian and Composite, three of which, from their antiquity,\r\nhave ever been held in high repute among Masons--the Doric, Ionic and\r\nCorinthian. The five human senses are hearing, seeing, feeling, tasting\r\nand smelling, the first three of which have ever been held in high\r\nrepute among Masons, because by hearing we hear the * * *; by seeing we\r\nsee the * * *, and by feeling we feel the * * *, whereby one Mason may\r\nknow another in the dark as well as in the light.\r\n\r\nThe seven steps allude to many sevens--the seven sabbatical years, seven\r\nyears of plenty, seven years of famine, seven years during which K. S.'s\r\nT. was in course of erection, seven golden candlesticks, but more\r\nparticularly the seven liberal arts and sciences, which are Grammar,\r\nRhetoric, Logic, Arithmetic, Geometry, Astronomy and Music.\r\n\r\n(Note:--A fine effect can be had, if an organ is played, by using the\r\nfollowing. The organist should begin to play softly when the speaker\r\nbegins on \"Music:\")\r\n\r\nMusic is that elevated science which affects the passions by sound.\r\nThere are few who have not felt its charms, and acknowledged its\r\nexpressions to be intelligible to the heart. It is a language of\r\ndelightful sensations, far more eloquent than words; it breathes to the\r\near the clearest intimations; it touches and gently agitates the\r\nagreeable and sublime passions; it wraps us in melancholy, elevates us\r\nin joy and melts us in tenderness. Again the pathetic dies away and\r\nmartial strains are heard, reminding us of the battlefield and its\r\nattendant glory.\r\n\r\n(As the word \"glory\" is pronounced the organist at once strikes the\r\nchords of some war-music like \"Dixie,\" \"Marseilles Hymn,\" etc. After a\r\nfew bars are played with full organ, the organist lets the music die\r\naway to a soft and gentle tremolo, and the Deacon resumes):\r\n\r\nThe glorious notes of the battle-hymn float over the red field of\r\ncarnage. Brave men hear the inspiring music; the ranks close up; the\r\nbayonets are fixed; and, with a cheer which strikes terror to the heart\r\nof the foe, they rush forward in one glorious charge, across the plain\r\nslippery with the blood of patriots, up the opposing hillside, even to\r\nthe mouth of cannon belching forth fire and death.--But stop! Look\r\nyonder! The dying soldier raises his head. His breast is already crimson\r\nwith his heart's-blood. His eye even now is dimming and glazing. The old\r\nhome comes back to him in memory. He puts his hand to his ear as if\r\nlistening. What does he hear?\r\n\r\n(Here the organist plays softly the strains of \"Home, Sweet Home,\" or\r\nsome well-known lullaby; during which the Deacon continues):\r\n\r\nAh, it is the old, old melody of youth and home! Again we are around the\r\nold hearthstone. Again do we kneel at mother's knee to lisp the evening\r\nprayer. Again she takes us in her arms, and sings to her tired child the\r\nsoft, low lullaby of childhood's happy days.--Oh, Music, Music! Art\r\nDivine! Thou dost move and stir the heart as nothing else can do! Yet\r\nnever canst thy sweet potency be better used than when it inspires\r\npraise and gratitude to the great Lord and Master of us all!\r\n\r\n(At the word \"all,\" the organist promptly strikes the chords of \"Old\r\nHundred,\" and, to its accompaniment, the Master calling up the Lodge,\r\nall unite in singing the long-metre doxology.)\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the outer door of the M. C., which we find partly\r\nopen, but strictly tiled by the J. W. We will see if we can gain\r\nadmission.\r\n\r\nJ. W.: \"Who comes here?\"\r\n\r\n\"A young F. C., on his way to the M. C. to have his name enrolled among\r\nthe workmen and to be taught the wages of a F. C.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you expect to pass the outer door?\"\r\n\r\n\"By the * * * and * * * of a F.

The Ephraimites were a\r\nwicked, stubborn and rebellious people, whom Jephtha strove to subdue by\r\nlenient means, but all to no avail. They became highly incensed because\r\nthey were not called to share in the rich spoils of the Ammonitish war,\r\nraised an exceeding great army, crossed over the river Jordan, came down\r\nupon Jephtha and gave him battle. Jephtha, being apprised of their\r\napproach, called out the mighty men of Gilead and put the Ephraimites to\r\nflight. And to make his victory secure, he placed guards at all the\r\npasses on the river Jordan, giving them this password: Shibboleth. The\r\nEphraimites, being of a different tribe and dialect, could not pronounce\r\nthe word Shibboleth, but called it Sibboleth, which trifling defect\r\nproved them enemies, and there fell at that time forty and two\r\nthousand.\"\r\n\r\n\"The * * * and * * * with the explanation are correct.

B. should serve as a faithful repository for all the secrets of the\r\nFraternity that may be entrusted to your care.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter G. has a very significant meaning. It is the initial of\r\nGeometry, the first and noblest of sciences, and the basis on which the\r\nsuperstructure of Freemasonry is erected. By Geometry we may curiously\r\ntrace Nature through her various windings to her most concealed\r\nrecesses; by it we discover the power, wisdom and goodness of the Grand\r\nArtificer of the Universe, and view with delight the proportions which\r\ncompose this vast machine; by it we discover how the planets move in\r\ntheir respective orbits and demonstrate their various revolutions; by it\r\nwe account for the return of the seasons, and the variety of scenes\r\nwhich each season displays to the discerning eye. Numberless worlds are\r\naround us, all framed by the same Divine Artist, which roll through the\r\nvast expanse, and are all conducted by the same unerring law of Nature.\r\n\r\nA survey of Nature, and the observation of her beautiful proportions,\r\nfirst determined man to imitate the divine plan and study symmetry and\r\norder. This gave rise to societies and birth to every useful art. The\r\narchitect began to design, and the plans which he laid down, being\r\nimproved by time and experience, have produced works which are the\r\nadmiration of every age.\r\n\r\nThe lapse of time, the ruthless hand of ignorance and the devastations\r\nof war have laid waste and destroyed many valuable monuments of\r\nantiquity, on which the utmost exertions of human genius have been\r\nemployed. Even the Temple of Solomon, so spacious and magnificent, and\r\nconstructed by so many celebrated artists, escaped not the unsparing\r\nravages of barbarous force. Freemasonry, notwithstanding, still\r\nsurvives. The attentive ear receives the sound from the instructive\r\ntongue, and the mysteries of Freemasonry are safely lodged in the\r\nrepository of faithful breasts.\r\n\r\nTools and implements of architecture and symbolic emblems most\r\nexpressive have been selected by the Fraternity to imprint on the mind\r\nwise and serious truths, and thus through a succession of ages have been\r\ntransmitted unimpaired the most excellent tenets of our institution.\r\n\r\nBut the letter G. has a far greater significance still. It is the\r\ninitial of Deity--a name that, at the mere mention of which, all, from\r\nthe W. M. in the east to the youngest E. A. in the northeast corner,\r\nshould with meekness reverently bow.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\nLecture.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\nSymbolism of the Degree.\r\n\r\nIf the object of the first degree is to symbolize the struggles of a\r\ncandidate groping in darkness for intellectual light, that of the second\r\ndegree represents the same candidate laboring amid all the difficulties\r\nthat encumber the young beginner in the attainment of learning and\r\nscience. The Entered Apprentice is to emerge from darkness to light; the\r\nFellow Craft is to come out of ignorance into knowledge. This degree,\r\ntherefore, by fitting emblems, is intended to typify these struggles of\r\nthe ardent mind for the attainment of truth--moral and intellectual\r\ntruth--and above all that Divine truth, the comprehension of which\r\nsurpasseth human understanding, and to which, standing in the Middle\r\nChamber, after his laborious ascent of the winding stairs, he can only\r\napproximate by the reception of an imperfect, yet glorious reward in the\r\nrevelation of that \"hieroglyphic light which none but craftsmen ever\r\nsaw.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCharge at Passing.\r\n\r\nBrother: Being passed to the second degree of Freemasonry, we\r\ncongratulate you on your preferment. The internal, and not the external,\r\nqualifications of a man are what Masonry regards. As you increase in\r\nknowledge you will improve in social intercourse.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to recapitulate the duties which as a Fellow Craft you\r\nare bound to discharge, or to enlarge on the necessity of a strict\r\nadherence to them, as your own experience must have established their\r\nvalue. Our laws and regulations you are strenuously to support, and be\r\nalways ready to assist in seeing them duly executed. You are not to\r\npalliate or aggravate the offenses of your brethren, but in the decision\r\nof every trespass against our rules you are to judge with candor,\r\nadmonish with friendship, and reprehend with justice.\r\n\r\nThe study of the liberal arts, that valuable branch of education which\r\ntends so effectually to polish and adorn the mind, is earnestly\r\nrecommended to your consideration, especially the science of Geometry,\r\nwhich is established as the basis of our art. Geometry, or Masonry,\r\noriginally synonymous terms, being of a divine and moral nature, is\r\nenriched with the most useful knowledge; while it proves the wonderful\r\nproperties of nature, it demonstrates the more important truths of\r\nmorality.\r\n\r\nYour past behavior and regular deportment have merited the honor which\r\nwe have conferred, and in your new character it is expected that you\r\nwill conform to the principles of the Institution by steadily\r\npersevering in the practice of every commendable virtue.\r\n\r\nSuch is the nature of your engagements as a Fellow Craft, and to these\r\nduties you are bound by the most sacred ties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMASTER MASON.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST SECTION.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nReception.\r\n\r\nThe Compasses are peculiarly dedicated to this degree, and as a Master\r\nMason you are taught that between their extreme points are contained the\r\nmost important tenets of Freemasonry--Friendship, Morality and Brotherly\r\nLove.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerambulation.\r\n\r\nThe following passage of Scripture is introduced:\r\n\r\nRemember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days\r\ncome not,\r\n\r\nNor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in\r\nthem; while the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not\r\ndarkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:\r\n\r\nIn the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong\r\nmen shall bow themselves,\r\n\r\nAnd the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of\r\nthe windows be darkened, and the doors shall be shut in the streets,\r\n\r\nWhen the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice\r\nof the bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low;\r\n\r\nAlso when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be\r\nin the way,\r\n\r\nAnd the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a\r\nburden, and desire shall fail:\r\n\r\nBecause man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the\r\nstreets: or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be\r\nbroken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at\r\nthe cistern.\r\n\r\nThen shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall\r\nreturn unto God who gave it.

Shield and defend us from the evil\r\nintentions of our enemies, and support us under the trials and\r\nafflictions we are destined to endure while traveling through this vale\r\nof tears. Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of\r\ntrouble. He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also\r\nas a shadow, and continueth not. Seeing his days are determined, the\r\nnumber of his months is with Thee; Thou hast appointed his bounds that\r\nhe cannot pass. Turn from him that he may rest till he shall accomplish\r\nhis day. For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will\r\nsprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. But man\r\ndieth and wasteth away; yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?\r\nAs the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up,\r\nso man lieth down, and riseth not till the heavens be no more. Yet, O\r\nLord, have compassion on the children of Thy creation; administer them\r\ncomfort in time of trouble, and save them with an everlasting salvation.\r\nAmen!\r\n\r\nResponse: So mote it be!\r\n\r\n    *    *    *\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    That we should be ever ready to go on foot, and even barefoot,\r\n    on a worthy M.

M., when communicated to us as\r\n    such, should be as secure and inviolate in our breasts as they\r\n    were in his before communication.\r\n\r\n    That we should be ever ready to stretch forth a hand to support\r\n    a falling brother, and aid him on all lawful occasions.\r\n\r\n    That we should be ever ready to whisper wise counsel in the ear\r\n    of a brother, and warn him of approaching danger.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *\r\n\r\n    It has been the practice of all ages to erect monuments to the\r\n    memory of exalted worth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD SECTION.\r\n\r\nThis section illustrates certain hieroglyphical emblems, and inculcates\r\nmany useful and impressive moral lessons. It also details many\r\nparticulars relative to the building of the Temple at Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n\r\nKing Solomon's Temple.\r\n\r\nThis magnificent structure was founded in the fourth year of the reign\r\nof Solomon, on the second day of the month Zif, being the second month\r\nof the sacred year. It was located on Mt. Moriah, near the place where\r\nAbraham was about to offer up his son Isaac, and where David met and\r\nappeased the destroying angel. Josephus informs us that, though more\r\nthan seven years were occupied in building it, yet, during the whole\r\nterm it did not rain in the day time, that the workmen might not be\r\nobstructed in their labor. From sacred history we also learn that there\r\nwas not the sound of ax, hammer or any tool of iron heard in the house\r\nwhile it was building. It is said to have been supported by 1,453\r\ncolumns and 2,906 pilasters, all hewn from the finest Parian marble. It\r\nwas symbolically supported, also, by three pillars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe three pillars here represented were explained in a preceding degree,\r\nand there represented Wisdom, Strength and Beauty. Here they represent\r\nour three ancient Grand Masters: S. K. of I., H. K. of T., and H. A.;\r\nthe pillar Wisdom, S. K. of I., by whose wisdom the Temple was erected,\r\nthat superb model of excellence which has so honored and exalted his\r\nname; the pillar Strength, H. K. of T., who strengthened K. S. in his\r\ngreat and important undertaking; and the pillar Beauty, H. A., the W. S.\r\nof the tribe of Naphtali, by whose cunning workmanship the Temple was so\r\nbeautified and adorned.\r\n\r\nThere were employed in its building 3 Grand Masters, 3,300 Masters or\r\noverseers of the work, 80,000 Fellow Crafts, and 70,000 Entered\r\nApprentices or bearers of burdens. All these were classed and arranged\r\nin such manner, by the wisdom of Solomon, that neither envy, discord nor\r\nconfusion was suffered to interrupt or disturb the peace and good\r\nfellowship which prevailed among the workmen, except in one notable\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *\r\n\r\nIn front of the magnificent porch were placed the two celebrated\r\npillars--one on the left hand, and one on the right hand. They are\r\nsupposed to have been placed there as a memorial to the children of\r\nIsrael of the happy deliverance of their forefathers from Egyptian\r\nbondage, and in commemoration of those two miraculous pillars of fire\r\nand of cloud. The pillar of fire gave light to the children of Israel\r\nand facilitated their march. The cloud proved darkness to Pharaoh and\r\nhis host and retarded their pursuit. King Solomon, therefore, ordered\r\nthese pillars placed at the entrance of the Temple, as the most\r\nconspicuous place, that the children of Israel might have that happy\r\nevent continually before their eyes in going to and returning from\r\ndivine worship.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Three Steps.\r\n\r\nThe Three Steps usually delineated upon the Master's Carpet are\r\nemblematical of the three principal stages of human life: Youth, Manhood\r\nand Age. In Youth, as Entered Apprentices, we ought industriously to\r\noccupy our minds in the attainment of useful knowledge; in Manhood, as\r\nFellow Crafts, we should apply our knowledge to the discharge of our\r\nrespective duties to God, our neighbor and ourselves, so that in Age, as\r\nMaster Masons, we may enjoy the happy reflection consequent on a\r\nwell-spent life, and die in the hope of a glorious immortality.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pot of Incense.\r\n\r\nThe Pot of Incense is an emblem of a pure heart, which is always an\r\nacceptable sacrifice to Deity; and as this glows with fervent heat, so\r\nshould our hearts continually glow with gratitude to the great and\r\nbeneficent Author of our existence for the manifold blessings and\r\ncomforts we enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Beehive.\r\n\r\nThe Beehive is an emblem of industry, and recommends the practice of\r\nthat virtue to all created beings, from the highest seraph in heaven to\r\nthe lowest reptile of the dust. It teaches us that as we came into the\r\nworld rational and intelligent beings, so we should ever be industrious\r\nones; never sitting down contented while our fellow-creatures around us\r\nare in want, especially when it is in our power to relieve them without\r\ninconvenience to ourselves.\r\n\r\nWhen we take a survey of Nature, we view man in his infancy, more\r\nhelpless and indigent than the brute creation; he lies languishing for\r\ndays, months and years, totally incapable of providing sustenance for\r\nhimself, of guarding against the attack of the wild beasts of the field,\r\nor sheltering himself from the inclemencies of the weather. It might\r\nhave pleased the great Creator of heaven and earth to have made man\r\nindependent of all created beings; but as dependence is one of the\r\nstrongest bonds of society, mankind were made dependent on each other\r\nfor protection and security, thereby enjoying better opportunities of\r\nfulfilling the duties of reciprocal love and friendship. Thus was man\r\nformed for social and active life, the noblest part of the work of God;\r\nand he who will so demean himself as not to endeavor to add to the\r\ncommon stock of knowledge may be deemed a drone in the hive of nature, a\r\nuseless member of society, and unworthy of our protection as Masons.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Book of Constitutions.\r\n\r\nThe Book of Constitutions guarded by the Tiler's Sword reminds us that\r\nwe should be ever watchful and guarded in our thoughts, words and\r\nactions, particularly when before the enemies of Masonry, ever bearing\r\nin remembrance those truly Masonic virtues, silence and circumspection.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sword.\r\n\r\nThe Sword pointing to a Naked Heart demonstrates that justice will\r\nsooner or later overtake us; and although our thoughts, words and\r\nactions may be hidden from the eyes of men, yet that--\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAll Seeing Eye whom the Sun, Moon and Stars obey, and under whose\r\nwatchful care even Comets perform their stupendous revolutions, pervades\r\nthe inmost recesses of the human Heart, and will reward us according to\r\nour merits.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Anchor and the Ark.\r\n\r\nThe Anchor and the Ark are emblems of a well-grounded hope and a\r\nwell-spent life. They are emblematical of that Divine Ark which safely\r\nwafts us over this tempestuous sea of troubles, and that Anchor which\r\nshall safely moor us in a peaceful harbor, where the wicked cease from\r\ntroubling and the weary are at rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nForty-seventh Problem of Euclid.\r\n\r\nThis was an invention of our ancient friend and brother Pythagoras, who,\r\nin his travels through Asia, Africa and Europe, was initiated into\r\nseveral orders of priesthood, and raised to the sublime degree of Master\r\nMason. This wise philosopher enriched his mind abundantly in a general\r\nknowledge of things and more especially in Geometry, or Masonry. On this\r\nsubject he drew out many problems and theorems; and among the most\r\ndistinguished he erected this, which, in the joy of his heart, he called\r\nEureka, in the Grecian language signifying \"I have found it;\" and upon\r\nthe erection of which he is said to have sacrificed a hecatomb. It\r\nteaches Masons to be general lovers of the arts and sciences.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hour-Glass.\r\n\r\nThe Hour-glass is an emblem of human life. Behold how swiftly the sands\r\nrun, and how rapidly our lives are drawing to a close! We cannot without\r\nastonishment behold the little particles which are contained in this\r\nmachine--how they pass away almost imperceptibly; and yet, to our\r\nsurprise, in the short space of an hour they are all exhausted. Thus\r\nwastes man! To-day he puts forth the tender leaves of hope; to-morrow\r\nblossoms, and bears his blushing honors thick upon him; the next day\r\ncomes a frost which nips the shoot; and when he thinks his greatness is\r\nstill aspiring, he falls, like autumn leaves, to enrich our mother\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Scythe.\r\n\r\nThe Scythe is an emblem of time, which cuts the brittle thread of life\r\nand launches us into eternity. Behold what havoc the Scythe of Time\r\nmakes among the human race! If by chance we should escape the numerous\r\nills incident to childhood and youth, and with health and vigor arrive\r\nat the years of manhood, yet withal we must soon be cut down by the\r\nall-devouring Scythe of Time, and be gathered into the land where our\r\nfathers have gone before us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThus we close the explanation of the emblems upon the solemn thought of\r\ndeath, which, without revelation, is dark and gloomy; but we are\r\nsuddenly revived by the ever-green and ever-living Sprig of Faith which\r\nstrengthens us, with confidence and composure, to look forward to a\r\nblessed immortality; and we doubt not that, on the glorious morn of the\r\nResurrection, our bodies will rise and become as incorruptible as our\r\nsouls.\r\n\r\nThen let us imitate the good man in his virtuous and amiable conduct, in\r\nhis unfeigned piety to God, in his inflexible fidelity to his trust,\r\nthat we may welcome the grim tyrant Death, and receive him as a kind\r\nmessenger sent from our Supreme Grand Master, to translate us from this\r\nimperfect to that all-perfect, glorious and celestial lodge above, where\r\nthe Supreme Architect of the Universe presides.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\nLecture.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *\r\n\r\n\r\nCharge.\r\n\r\nMy Brother--Your zeal for the institution of Masonry, the progress you\r\nhave made in the mysteries, and your conformity to our regulations, have\r\npointed you out as a proper object of our favor and esteem. You are now\r\nbound, by duty, honor and gratitude to be faithful to your trust; to\r\nsupport the dignity of your character on every occasion; and to enforce,\r\nby precept and example, obedience to the tenets of the Order.\r\n\r\nIn the character of a Master Mason you are authorized to correct the\r\nerrors and irregularities of your uninformed brethren, and to guard them\r\nagainst a breach of fidelity. To preserve the reputation of the\r\nfraternity unsullied must be your constant care; and for this purpose it\r\nis your province to recommend to your inferiors obedience and\r\nsubmission; to your equals, courtesy and affability; to your superiors,\r\nkindness and condescension. Universal benevolence you are always to\r\ninculcate, and by the regularity of your own behavior afford the best\r\nexample for the conduct of others less informed. The ancient landmarks\r\nof the Order, intrusted to your care, you are carefully to preserve, and\r\nnever suffer them to be infringed, or countenance a deviation from the\r\nestablished usages and customs of the fraternity.\r\n\r\nYour virtue, honor and reputation are concerned in supporting with\r\ndignity the character you now bear. Let no motive, therefore, make you\r\nswerve from your duty, violate your vows or betray your trust; but be\r\ntrue and faithful, and imitate the example of that celebrated artist\r\nwhom you have this evening represented. Thus you will render yourself\r\ndeserving of the honor which we have conferred, and merit the confidence\r\nthat we have reposed in you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMS AND CEREMONIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrand Honors.\r\n\r\nThe public Grand Honors (not funeral) are given by raising the hands\r\nabove and a little in front of the head, and clapping them three times\r\ntogether, then letting them fall to the side--repeating this action\r\ntwice, making three times.\r\n\r\nThe private Grand Honors are made by 3x3, but not in the same way as the\r\npublic Grand Honors.\r\n\r\n\r\nReception of Visitors.\r\n\r\nThe reception of visitors with the honor due to their rank is an ancient\r\ncustom of the fraternity which should never be omitted. It is an act of\r\ngreat discourtesy to a visiting officer to omit his formal reception by\r\nthe Lodge, and in an official visitation the visiting officer should\r\nordinarily require it. On the occasion of visits not official it will be\r\nfound to greatly increase a true fraternal feeling when courtesy is\r\nproperly shown.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--Grand Lodge.\r\n\r\nWhen a visit from the Grand Lodge is expected, the Master will see that\r\na convenient apartment is provided for the use of the Grand Lodge, where\r\nthe same can be opened in the proper form. On being notified that the\r\nGrand Lodge is opened and prepared for the visitation, the Master, the\r\nLodge being opened on the third degree, will send a committee, headed,\r\nif possible, by a Past Master, with the Masters of Ceremony with their\r\nrods, the Deacons with their rods, and the Marshal, to escort the Grand\r\nLodge. A procession is formed in the following order:\r\n\r\n    Marshal.\r\n    Masters of Ceremony.\r\n    Committee.\r\n    Deacons.\r\n    The Grand Lodge.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the door, the Grand Marshal will announce:\r\n\r\n\"The Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of F. and A. M. of the State of\r\nArkansas.\"\r\n\r\nThe procession enters, the Masters of Ceremony and Deacons halt inside\r\nthe door and cross their rods, the committee proceed, followed by the\r\nGrand Lodge in the inverse order of their rank. When the Grand Master\r\narrives in front of the altar, he halts, and the Grand Lodge filing to\r\nthe right and left form a line across the hall. The committee then\r\nintroduce The Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of\r\nArkansas. The Grand Master then advances to the East, and the Master\r\nreceives him according to ancient usages, with the private Grand Honors\r\nof Masonry, and resigns to him the chair and the gavel, each other Grand\r\nOfficer taking his station in place of the corresponding officer of the\r\nLodge, and the brethren are seated.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Master, at his pleasure, resigns the chair to the Master,\r\nwhereupon the other Grand Officers resign their respective stations to\r\nthe proper officers of the Lodge, and repair to the East, and take\r\nseats on the right of the Grand Master.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Lodge should retire before the Lodge is closed. When the Grand\r\nMaster announces his intention to retire, the Lodge is called up, the\r\nGrand Honors are given, and the Masters of Ceremony and Deacons repair\r\nto the door and cross their rods, the Marshal conducts the procession of\r\nthe Grand Lodge to the door, and salutes as the procession passes him.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--The Grand Master.\r\n\r\nWhen a visit from the Grand Master is expected, the Master will see that\r\na convenient apartment is provided for his use and that of his suite.\r\nWhen the Grand Master's visit is announced, the Master sends the\r\nMarshal, Deacons, Masters of Ceremony, and one of the oldest members (a\r\nPast Master, if practicable) bearing the Book of Constitutions, to\r\nescort him to the Lodge Room. A procession is formed in the following\r\norder:\r\n\r\n    Marshal.\r\n    Masters of Ceremony.\r\n    Suite.\r\n    Brother with the Book of Constitutions.\r\n    Grand Master.\r\n    Deacons.\r\n\r\nThe Marshal announces to Tyler, Tyler to J. D., and J. D.: \"The Most\r\nWorshipful Grand Master of Masons of Arkansas,\" when the Master calls up\r\nthe Lodge. The Masters of Ceremony stop inside, and cross their rods,\r\nwhile the others proceed towards the East. On arriving at the altar, the\r\nsuite open inwards, the Grand Master passes through, and the others,\r\nfiling to the right and left, form a line across the hall. The private\r\nGrand Honors are then given. The Grand Master advances to the East, and\r\nthe Master receives him, resigns to him the chair and the gavel. The\r\nsuite take place on the right of the Master, and the Lodge is seated.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Master may decline to receive the chair and gavel, or at his\r\npleasure may resign the same.\r\n\r\nWhen the Grand Master announces his intention to retire, having\r\npreviously resigned the chair and gavel to the Master, the Lodge is\r\ncalled up, the Private Grand Honors are given and the Master directs the\r\nproper officers to attend for the escort of the Grand Master. The\r\nMasters of Ceremony halt at the door, cross their rods, and the other\r\nofficers escort the Grand Master to his apartment.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--The Deputy Grand Master, Grand Wardens, Etc.\r\n\r\nThe form will be the same as for the Grand Master, except that the Book\r\nof Constitutions will not be borne before them.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--Other Brethren.\r\n\r\nWhen a brother visits a Lodge for the first time and has been vouched\r\nfor, the Master will send the Senior Deacon to introduce him. That\r\nofficer conducts him to the Altar and says:\r\n\r\n\"Worshipful Master, I have the pleasure of introducing to you Brother\r\n......, of ...... Lodge ......\"\r\n\r\nThe Master calls up the Lodge and says:\r\n\r\n\"Brother ......, it gives me pleasure to Introduce to you the members of\r\n...... Lodge and to welcome you to a seat among us. We meet on ......,\r\nand shall be very glad to welcome you to any of our meetings.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senior Deacon conducts the visitor to a seat and the Lodge is\r\nseated.\r\n\r\nIf the visitor is to be examined the W. M. appoints a committee, who\r\nretire at the door of the preparation room, the S. D. passing them out.\r\nWhen the committee are ready to report, they make an alarm at the door\r\nof the preparation room. The S. D. attends to it, and reports that the\r\nexamining committee desire admission. The W. M. directs him to admit\r\nthem. When he goes to the door, if the committee expect to report\r\nfavorably they will introduce the S. D. to the visitor. The committee\r\nthen come in and make their report at the altar that they have examined\r\n......, who claims to be a member of ...... Lodge No. ......, under the\r\njurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of ...... and find him to be a Master\r\nMason (or, that they are not satisfied to vouch for him as a worthy\r\nMason). The W. M. seats the committee, and asks if there is any\r\nobjection to the admission of ...... as a visitor. Any member of the\r\nLodge has the right to object to the admission of a visitor, but the\r\ngrounds of the objection must be stated to the W. M., who shall judge of\r\nthe sufficiency thereof. If there be no objection, the W. M. directs the\r\nS. D. to introduce the brother. The S. D. presents him at the altar and\r\nintroduces him to the W. M., who in turn introduces him to the Lodge in\r\nthe form above. No brother should be allowed to visit a lodge for the\r\nfirst time without an introduction. If the visitor is a Past Master, he\r\nshould be invited to a seat in the East.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElection and Installation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Master, Senior Warden, Junior Warden, Treasurer and Secretary of a\r\nchartered Lodge must be chosen annually by ballot, and by a majority of\r\nvotes, at the time fixed in the by-laws. The Senior and Junior Deacons\r\nand Tyler are appointed by the W. M. A Chaplain and Senior and Junior\r\nMasters of Ceremony may be appointed also.\r\n\r\nIf a lodge fails to elect officers at the time appointed, it may at said\r\nmeeting, or at the next regular meeting thereof, appoint a day for such\r\nelection, not more than three months from the regular time, and may,\r\nwithout dispensation, elect officers at said appointed time and install\r\nthem at once.\r\n\r\nNo member in arrears for dues at the time of the regular election shall\r\nbe elected or appointed to any office in the Lodge, nor be allowed to\r\nvote at such election.\r\n\r\nEvery voter is eligible to any office except that of Master.\r\n\r\nWhere a Lodge finds it absolutely necessary to elect a brother W. M.,\r\nwho has not served as Warden, the facts must be reported to the Grand\r\nMaster, and the Master-elect must not be installed without his\r\ndispensation.\r\n\r\nWhen vacancies occur in any of the elective offices of the Lodge, they\r\nmust be filled by seniority or pro tem. appointments during the\r\nremainder of the term. No election can be held to fill them except by\r\ndispensation of the Grand Master.\r\n\r\nEach Lodge may make its own rule as to whether nominations shall be made\r\nor vote without nominations.\r\n\r\nNo one can be installed by proxy.\r\n\r\nOfficers re-elected must be installed after each election.\r\n\r\nMembership in a Lodge is necessary to eligibility to office except in\r\ncase of Tyler and Organist.\r\n\r\nAny Past Master in good standing of a Blue Lodge can install the\r\nofficers of a Lodge.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALLATIONS.\r\n\r\nOfficers of a New Lodge.\r\n\r\nThe new Lodge having been constituted, etc., the Grand Master says:\r\n\r\nG. M.: This Lodge having been constituted, I will now install its\r\nofficers. Right Worshipful Deputy Grand Master, collect the official\r\njewels, place them upon the altar, and present Brother ---- ----, who\r\nhas been elected Worshipful Master.\r\n\r\nThe Deputy Grand Master now conducts the W. M. elect before the altar,\r\nfacing the East, and says:\r\n\r\nD. G. M.: Most Worshipful Grand Master, I present Brother ---- ----, to\r\nbe installed Worshipful Master of this Lodge.\r\n\r\nG. M.: Right Worshipful Deputy Grand Master, have you carefully examined\r\nthe brother, and do you find him qualified to discharge the duties of\r\nthe office for which he has been chosen?\r\n\r\nD. G. M.: Most Worshipful Grand Master, I find him to be qualified and\r\nof good morals, of great skill, true and trusty; and, as he is a lover\r\nof the Fraternity, I doubt not he will discharge his duties with\r\nfidelity and honor.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Master will perform the installation service to the end,\r\ncontinuing the ceremony as for annually elected officers, the Deputy\r\nGrand Master assisting.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnually Elected Officers.\r\n\r\nInstalling his successor is usually the prerogative of the retiring\r\nWorshipful Master, although any Past Master may act as installing\r\nofficer for the occasion. A competent brother (usually a Past Master)\r\nwill be appointed to act as Marshal, who will present the officers-elect\r\nfor installation. All things being in order, the Installing Officer\r\nsays:\r\n\r\nInst. Off.: Brother Marshal, you will present the Worshipful\r\nMaster-elect for installation.\r\n\r\nMar: Worshipful Master, I present Brother ----, who has been elected\r\nWorshipful Master of this Lodge, and is now ready for installation.\r\n\r\nInst. Off.: Brethren, you now behold before you Brother ---- ----, who\r\nhas been elected to serve this Lodge as Worshipful Master, and now\r\ndeclares himself ready for installation. If any of you have any reason\r\nto urge why he should not be installed you will make it known now, or\r\nforever after hold your peace. No objection being offered, I shall now\r\ninstall him.\r\n\r\nInst. Off.: Brother ---- ----, I congratulate you upon your election as\r\nWorshipful Master of this Lodge, and it will afford me great pleasure to\r\ninvest you with the authority and the insignia of your office. Previous\r\nto your investiture, however, it is necessary that you signify your\r\nassent to those charges and regulations which point out the duty of the\r\nMaster of a Lodge:\r\n\r\nI. You agree to be a good man and true, and strictly to obey the moral\r\nlaw?\r\n\r\nII. You agree to be a peaceable citizen and cheerfully to conform to the\r\nlaws of the country in which you reside?\r\n\r\nIII.

You agree to avoid private piques and quarrels, and to guard against\r\nintemperance and excess?\r\n\r\nVII.

You promise to pay homage to the Grand Master for the time being, and\r\nto his officers when duly installed, and strictly to conform to every\r\nedict of the Grand Lodge that is not subversive of the principles and\r\ngroundwork of Masonry?\r\n\r\nXI. You admit that it is not in the power of any man, or body of men, to\r\nmake innovations in the body of Masonry?\r\n\r\nXII.

You agree that no visitor shall be received into your Lodge without\r\ndue examination, or being properly vouched for?\r\n\r\nThese are the regulations of Free and Accepted Masons. Do you submit to\r\nthese charges and promise to support these regulations, as Masters have\r\ndone in all ages before you?\r\n\r\nThe Master answers: I do.\r\n\r\nInst. Off.: Brother ---- ----, in consequence of your conformity to the\r\ncharges and regulations of the Fraternity, you are now to be installed\r\nMaster of this Lodge, in full confidence of your skill and capacity to\r\ngovern the same.\r\n\r\nThe Master is then regularly invested with the insignia of his office,\r\nand the furniture and implements of the Lodge are placed in his charge.\r\nThe various implements of his profession are emblematical of his conduct\r\nin life, and are fully explained, as follows:\r\n\r\nInst. Off.: The Holy Writings, that Great Light in Masonry, which guides\r\nus to all truth, directs our path to the temple of happiness, and points\r\nout the whole duty of man.\r\n\r\nThe Square teaches us to regulate our actions and harmonize our conduct\r\nwith the principles of morality and virtue.\r\n\r\nThe Compasses teach us to limit our desires in every station, that,\r\nrising to eminence by merit, we may live respected and die regretted.\r\n\r\nThe Rule directs us to punctually observe our duty, press forward in the\r\npath of virtue, and, inclining neither to the right nor to the left, in\r\nall our actions to have eternity in view.\r\n\r\nThe Line, the emblem of moral rectitude, teaches us to avoid\r\ndissimulation in conversation and action, and to walk in the path which\r\nleads to a blessed immortality.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution and Laws you are to search at all times and cause to be\r\nread in your Lodge, that none may pretend ignorance of the excellent\r\nprecepts they enjoin.\r\n\r\nYou now receive in charge the Charter, by the authority of which this\r\nLodge is held. You are carefully to preserve the same and duly transmit\r\nit to your successor in office.\r\n\r\nYou will also receive in charge the By-Laws of your Lodge, which you are\r\nto see carefully and punctually executed.\r\n\r\nThe new Master is conducted to the East and placed on the right of the\r\nInstalling Officer until the other officers are installed.\r\n\r\nThe other officers are then severally presented by the Marshal to the\r\nInstalling Officer, who delivers to each his appropriate charge.\r\n\r\n\r\nSenior Warden.\r\n\r\nInst. Off.: Brother ---- ----, you have been elected Senior Warden of\r\nthis Lodge. Do you solemnly promise that you will serve the Lodge as\r\nSenior Warden for the ensuing year, and will perform all the duties\r\nappertaining to that office to the best of your ability? (He assents.)\r\nYou will now be invested with the insignia of your office.\r\n\r\nThe Level teaches that we are descended from the same stock, partake of\r\nthe same nature, and share the same hope; \"that we are all children of\r\none common father, heirs of the same infirmities, and exposed to the\r\nsame vicissitudes.\" It also reminds us that, although distinctions among\r\nmen are necessary to preserve subordination, no eminence of station\r\nshould make us forget that we are brethren, and that in the Lodge and in\r\nall our Masonic associations, we are on a level. This implement teaches\r\nus that a time will come, and the wisest knows not how soon, when all\r\ndistinctions but that of goodness, shall cease, and death, the grand\r\nleveler of all human greatness, reduce us to the same state.\r\n\r\nYour regular attendance on the stated and other meetings of the Lodge is\r\nessentially necessary. In the absence of the Master you are to govern\r\nthe Lodge, and in his presence assist him in the government of it. Hence\r\nyou will perceive the necessity of preparing yourself for the important\r\nduties which may devolve upon you. Look well to the West, and guard with\r\nscrupulous care the pillar committed to your charge.\r\n\r\nHe is conducted to his proper station.\r\n\r\n\r\nJunior Warden.\r\n\r\nInst. Off.: Brother ---- ----, you have been elected Junior Warden of\r\nthis Lodge. Do you solemnly promise that you will serve the Lodge as\r\nJunior Warden for the ensuing year, and will perform all the duties\r\nappertaining to that office to the best of your ability? (He assents.)\r\nYou will now be invested with the insignia of your office.\r\n\r\nThe Plumb admonishes us to walk uprightly in our several stations; to do\r\nunto others as we would have others do to us; to observe the just medium\r\nbetween intemperance and pleasure, and make our passions and prejudices\r\ncoincide with the line of our duty.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of the Master and Senior Warden upon you devolves the\r\ngovernment of the Lodge; but to you is especially committed the\r\nsuperintendence of the Craft during the hours of refreshment; it is,\r\ntherefore, not only necessary that you should be temperate and discreet\r\nin the indulgence of your own inclinations, but carefully observe that\r\nnone of the Craft convert the purpose of refreshment into intemperance\r\nor excess. Look well to the South. Guard with vigilance the pillar\r\ncommitted to your charge, that nothing may disturb the harmony of the\r\nLodge or mar its beauty.\r\n\r\nHe is conducted to his proper station.\r\n\r\n\r\nTreasurer.\r\n\r\nInst. Off.: Brother ---- ----, you have been elected Treasurer of this\r\nLodge and will now be invested with the jewel of your office.\r\n\r\nIt is your duty to receive all moneys belonging to the Lodge from the\r\nSecretary, keep a just and true account thereof, and pay them out by\r\norder of the Worshipful Master and consent of the Lodge. Your own honor\r\nand the confidence the brethren repose in you will arouse you to that\r\nfaithfulness in the discharge of the duties of your office which its\r\nimportant nature demands.\r\n\r\nHe is conducted to his station.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecretary.\r\n\r\nInst. Off.: Brother ---- ----, you have been elected Secretary of this\r\nLodge, and will now be invested with the jewel of your office.\r\n\r\nIt is your duty to \"keep a faithful record of all things pertaining to\r\nthe Lodge, proper to be written, transmit a copy of the same to the\r\nGrand Lodge when required, receive all moneys due the Lodge and pay them\r\nto the Treasurer, taking his receipt for the same.\"\r\n\r\nYour love for the Craft and attachment to the Lodge will induce you\r\ncheerfully to fulfill the very important duties of your office, and in\r\nso doing you will merit the esteem of your brethren.\r\n\r\nHe is conducted to his station.\r\n\r\n\r\nChaplain.\r\n\r\nInst. Off.: Brother ---- ----, you have been appointed Chaplain of this\r\nLodge, and will now be invested with the jewel of your office.\r\n\r\nIt will be your duty to perform those solemn services which we should\r\nconstantly render to our infinite Creator, and which, when offered by\r\none whose holy profession is \"to point to heaven and lead the way,\" may,\r\nby refining our souls, strengthening our virtues, and purifying our\r\nminds, prepare us for admission into the society of those above, whose\r\nhappiness will be as endless as it is perfect.\r\n\r\nHe is conducted to his station, which is in the East in front and to the\r\nleft of the W. M.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Senior and Junior Deacons.\r\n\r\nInst. Off.: Brothers ---- and ----, you are appointed Deacons of this\r\nLodge, and are now invested with the badge of your office. It is your\r\nprovince to attend on the Master and Wardens and to act as their proxies\r\nin the active duties of the Lodge; such as in the reception of\r\ncandidates into the different degrees of Masonry, the introduction and\r\naccommodation of visitors, and in the immediate practice of our rites.\r\nThe Square and Compasses, as badges of your office, I entrust to your\r\ncare, not doubting your vigilance and attention.\r\n\r\nThey are conducted to their stations.\r\n\r\n\r\nMasters of Ceremonies.\r\n\r\nInst. Off.: Brothers ---- and ----, you have been appointed Masters of\r\nCeremonies of this Lodge, and will now be invested with the jewels of\r\nyour office. The positions to which you are assigned in the Lodge are\r\nvery important. You are to assist the Senior Deacon and other officers\r\nin performing their respective duties. Your conduct should be courteous\r\nand dignified. Remember that in your company the candidate will receive\r\nhis first impressions of our institution. Your regular and early\r\nattendance at our meetings will afford the best proof of your zeal and\r\nattachment to the Lodge.\r\n\r\nThey are conducted to their stations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTiler.\r\n\r\nInst. Off.: Brother ---- ----, you have been appointed Tiler of this\r\nLodge, and will now be invested with the jewel and the implement of your\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nAs the Sword is placed in the hands of the Tiler to enable him\r\neffectually to guard the Lodge against the approach of cowans and\r\neavesdroppers, and suffer none to pass or re-pass except such as are\r\nduly qualified and have permission of the Worshipful Master, so it\r\nshould morally serve as a constant admonition to us to set a guard over\r\nour thoughts, a watch at our lips, and a sentinel over our actions,\r\nthereby preventing the approach of every unworthy thought or deed, and\r\npreserving consciences void of offence toward God and toward man. Your\r\nearly and punctual attendance will give us the best proof of your\r\nappreciation of and love for the institution.\r\n\r\nHe is conducted to his station.\r\n\r\nThe Installing Officer, addressing the Master, when presenting the\r\nGavel, explains its power and use.\r\n\r\nOne * of which calls * * *; two * calls * * *; three * calls * * *\r\n\r\nWorshipful Master, behold your brethren!\r\n\r\nBrethren, behold your Master!\r\n\r\nThe grand honors are then given the W. M. by the Lodge, the Marshal\r\nleading in the ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe brethren are now seated. Then the Grand Master or Installing Officer\r\nmay deliver an address or read the following charges, in his discretion:\r\n\r\n\"Worshipful Master: The superintendence and government of the brethren\r\nwho compose this Lodge having been committed to your care, you cannot be\r\ninsensible of the obligations which devolve on you as their head, nor\r\nof your responsibility for the faithful discharge of the important\r\nduties annexed to your position.\r\n\r\nThe honor, reputation and usefulness of this Lodge will materially\r\ndepend upon the skill and assiduity with which you manage its concerns;\r\nwhile the happiness of its members will be generally promoted in\r\nproportion to the zeal and ability with which you propagate the genuine\r\nprinciples of our institution.\r\n\r\nAs a pattern for imitation, consider the great luminary of nature,\r\nwhich, rising in the East, regularly diffuses light and luster to all\r\nwithin the circle. In like manner, it is your province to spread and\r\ncommunicate light and instruction to the brethren of your Lodge.\r\nForcibly impress upon them the dignity and high importance of Masonry,\r\nand seriously admonish them never to disgrace it. Charge them to\r\npractice out of the Lodge those duties which they have been taught in\r\nit; and by amiable, discreet and virtuous conduct, to convince mankind\r\nof the goodness of the institution; so that when a person is said to be\r\na member of it, the world may know that he is one to whom the burdened\r\nheart may pour out its sorrows, to whom distress may prefer its suit,\r\nwhose hand is guided by justice, and whose heart is expanded by\r\nbenevolence.\r\n\r\nIn short, by a diligent observance of the By-Laws of the Lodge, the\r\nConstitutions of Freemasonry, and, above all, the Holy Scriptures, which\r\nare given as a rule and a guide to your faith, you will be enabled to\r\nacquit yourself with honor and reputation, and lay up a crown of\r\nrejoicing, which shall continue when time shall be no more.\r\n\r\nBrother Senior and Junior Warden: You are too well acquainted with the\r\nprinciples of Masonry to warrant any distrust that you will be found\r\nwanting in the discharge of your respective duties. Suffice it to say,\r\nthat what you have seen praiseworthy in others you should carefully\r\nimitate; and what in them may have appeared defective you should in\r\nyourselves amend. You should be examples of good order and regularity;\r\nfor it is only by a due regard to the laws in your own conduct that you\r\ncan expect obedience to them from others. You are assiduously to assist\r\nthe Master in the discharge of his trust, diffusing light and imparting\r\nknowledge to all whom he shall place under your care. In the absence of\r\nthe Master, you will succeed to higher duties; your acquirements must\r\ntherefore be such that the Craft may never suffer for want of proper\r\ninstruction. From the spirit which you have hitherto evinced, I\r\nentertain no doubt that your future conduct will be such as to merit the\r\napplause of your brethren and the testimony of a good conscience.\r\n\r\nThe Lodge being called up, the Installing Officer continues as follows:\r\n\r\nBrethren of ---- Lodge: Such is the nature of our constitution, that as\r\nsome must of necessity rule and teach, so others must, of course, learn\r\nto submit and obey. Humility in both is an essential duty. The officers\r\nwho are chosen to govern your Lodge are sufficiently conversant with the\r\nrules of propriety and the laws of the institution to avoid exceeding\r\nthe powers with which they are entrusted, and you are of too generous\r\ndispositions to envy their preferment; I, therefore, trust that you will\r\nhave but one aim--to please each other, and unite in the grand design of\r\nbeing happy and communicating happiness.\r\n\r\n\"Finally, my brethren, as this Lodge has been formed and perfected in so\r\nmuch unanimity and concord, so may it long continue. May you long enjoy\r\nevery satisfaction and delight which disinterested friendship can\r\nafford. May kindness and brotherly affection distinguish your conduct as\r\nmen and as Masons. Within your peaceful walls may your children's\r\nchildren celebrate, with joy and gratitude, the annual recurrence of\r\nthis auspicious solemnity; and may the tenets of our profession be\r\ntransmitted through this Lodge, pure and unimpaired, from generation to\r\ngeneration.\"\r\n\r\nThe Marshal then makes proclamation from the South, West and East in the\r\nfollowing manner:\r\n\r\n\"I am directed to proclaim, and I do hereby proclaim, that the\r\nWorshipful Master, Wardens, and other officers, elected and appointed,\r\nof ---- Lodge, have been regularly installed into their respective\r\nstations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTITUTING AND CONSTITUTING NEW LODGE\r\n\r\n\r\nCeremony for Instituting a Lodge Under Dispensation.\r\n\r\nThe members of the new Lodge, whether they are to be instituted by the\r\nGrand Master, or by a brother deputized by him, will, in either case, be\r\nnotified by the Master to assemble in their Lodge room at the time\r\ndetermined upon. After the brethren are assembled, the Grand Master, or\r\nInstituting Officer, will assume the East and announce the object of the\r\nmeeting. He then causes the Letter of Dispensation to be read, after\r\nwhich the names of the officers appointed by the Grand Master and by the\r\nMaster of the new Lodge will be announced. As these names are called,\r\nthe officers will form in line near and facing the East, when each\r\nofficer will be invested with his jewel. The new Master will then be\r\nseated in the East, on the right of the Instituting Officer. The Wardens\r\nand other officers will take their respective stations. The Instituting\r\nOfficer will then open the Lodge on the third degree of Masonry, and\r\ndeliver to the officers and brethren the following\r\n\r\n\r\nCharges to the Officers and Brethren.\r\n\r\nInst. Off.: Worshipful Master: (Who rises.) The Grand Master having\r\ncommitted to your care the superintendence and government of the\r\nbrethren who are to compose this new lodge, you cannot be insensible of\r\nthe obligations which devolve on you, as their head, nor of your\r\nresponsibility for the faithful discharge of the important duties\r\nattached to your office.\r\n\r\nThe honor, reputation, and usefulness of your Lodge will materially\r\ndepend on the skill and assiduity with which you manage its concerns;\r\nwhile the happiness of its members will be generally promoted in\r\nproportion to the zeal and ability with which you propagate the genuine\r\nprinciples of our institution.\r\n\r\nFor a pattern of imitation, consider the sun, which, rising in the east,\r\nregularly diffuses light and luster to all within its circle. In like\r\nmanner, it is in your province to spread and communicate light and\r\ninstruction to the brethren of your Lodge. Forcibly impress upon them\r\nthe dignity and high importance of Masonry; and seriously admonish them\r\nnever to disgrace it. Charge them to practice out of the Lodge, those\r\nduties which they have been taught in it; and by amiable, discreet, and\r\nvirtuous conduct, to convince mankind of the goodness of the\r\nInstitution; so that, when any one is said to be a member of it, the\r\nworld may know that he is one to whom the burdened heart may pour out\r\nits sorrows, to whom distress may prefer its suit, whose hand is guided\r\nby justice, and whose heart is expanded by benevolence. In short, by a\r\ndiligent observance of the by-laws of your Lodge, the Constitution of\r\nMasonry, and above all, the Holy Scriptures, which are given as a rule\r\nand guide to your faith, you will be enabled to acquit yourself with\r\nhonor and reputation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharge to the Wardens.\r\n\r\nBrothers Senior and Junior Wardens: (Who are called up by one knock.)\r\nYou are too well acquainted with the principles of Masonry to warrant\r\nany distrust that you will be found wanting in the discharge of your\r\nrespective duties. What you have seen praiseworthy in others you should\r\ncarefully imitate, and what in them may have appeared defective, you\r\nshould in yourselves amend. You should be examples of good order and\r\nregularity, for it is only by a due regard to the laws, in your own\r\nconduct, that you can expect obedience to them from others. You are\r\nassiduously to assist the Master in the discharge of his trust,\r\ndiffusing light and imparting knowledge to all whom he shall place under\r\nyour care. In the absence of the Master you will succeed to higher\r\nduties; your acquirements must therefore be such that the Craft may\r\nnever suffer for want of proper instruction. From the spirit which you\r\nhave hitherto evinced, I entertain no doubt that your future conduct\r\nwill be such as to merit the applause of your brethren, and the\r\ntestimony of a good conscience.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharge to the Brethren of the Lodge.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *\r\n\r\nBrethren of ...... Lodge, such is the nature of our Constitution, that\r\nas some must of necessity rule and teach, so others must, of course,\r\nlearn to submit and obey. Humility in both is an essential duty. The\r\nofficers who are appointed to govern the Lodge are sufficiently\r\nconversant with the rules of propriety and the laws of the Institution\r\nto avoid exceeding the powers with which they are intrusted, and you\r\nare of too generous dispositions to envy their preferment. I therefore\r\ntrust that you will have but one aim, to please each other and to unite\r\nin the grand design of being happy and communicating happiness.\r\n\r\nFinally, my brethren, as this association has been formed and perfected\r\nin so much unity and concord, in which we greatly rejoice, so may it\r\nlong continue. May you enjoy every satisfaction and delight, which\r\ndisinterested friendship can afford. May kindness and brotherly\r\naffection distinguish your conduct as men and Masons. Within your\r\npeaceful walls, may your children, and your children's children\r\ncelebrate, with joy and gratitude, the annual recurrence of this\r\nauspicious solemnity. And may the tenets of our profession be\r\ntransmitted through your Lodge, pure and unimpaired, from generation to\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\n\r\nProclamation.\r\n\r\nInstituting Officer: (Calls up Lodge.) In the name and by the authority\r\nof the Most Worshipful* Grand Master of Free and Accepted Masons of\r\nthe State of Arkansas, I now declare this Lodge duly instituted and\r\nproperly prepared for the transaction of such business as may lawfully\r\ncome before it.\r\n\r\n* If Grand Master Institutes the Lodge, in person, he will omit what\r\nprecedes the * and insert \"as.\"\r\n\r\nInstituting Officer: (Addressing Master.) I now deliver to you the\r\nDispensation empowering you and your brethren to work as a Regular\r\nLodge. You are its custodian and must see to it that it is present at\r\nall Communications of the Lodge. You must also, as required by law,\r\nsafely transmit it to the Grand Secretary just prior to the next Annual\r\nCommunication of the Grand Lodge, and when this is done, Masonic work in\r\nthis Lodge must cease until the Dispensation is continued by the Grand\r\nLodge, or until the Lodge is constituted. I now deliver to you the gavel\r\nof authority; wield it, my brother, with prudence and discretion. You\r\nwill now assume your station.\r\n\r\n\r\nConstituting a Newly Chartered Lodge.\r\n\r\nAfter the grant of a charter the new Lodge thus created should be\r\nconstituted, and its officers installed, by the Grand Master or his\r\nDeputy or some past or present Master. The Lodge is opened on the Third\r\nDegree. The Marshal forms the officers of the new Lodge in front of the\r\nInstalling Officer, whereupon the Deputy G. M. addresses the G. M. as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nMost Worshipful, a number of brethren, duly instructed in the mysteries\r\nof Masonry, having assembled together for some time past by virtue of a\r\ndispensation granted them for that purpose, do now desire to be\r\nregularly constituted as a lodge agreeably to the ancient usages and\r\ncustoms of the fraternity.\r\n\r\nThe charter is presented by the D. G. M. to the Grand Master, who\r\nexamines it and, if correct, proclaims:\r\n\r\nG. M.--The charter appears to be correct and is approved. Upon due\r\ndeliberation the Grand Lodge has granted the brethren of this new Lodge\r\na charter establishing and confirming them in the rights and privileges\r\nof a regularly constituted Lodge. We shall now proceed according to the\r\nancient usage to constitute these brethren into a regular Lodge.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the new Lodge deliver up their jewels and badges to\r\ntheir Master, who presents them, with his own, to the D. G. M. and he to\r\nthe G. M.\r\n\r\nThe D. G. M. then presents the Master-elect to the G. M., saying:\r\n\r\nD. G. M.--Most Worshipful, I present to you Brother ----, whom the\r\nmembers of the Lodge now to be constituted have chosen for their Master.\r\n\r\nThe G. M. asks the brethren if they remain satisfied with their choice.\r\n(They bow in token of assent.)\r\n\r\nThe Master-elect then presents, severally, his Wardens and other\r\nofficers, naming them and their respective offices. The G. M. asks the\r\nbrethren if they remain satisfied with each and all of them. (They bow\r\nas before.)\r\n\r\nThe officers and members of the new Lodge form in front of the G. M. and\r\nthe business of consecration commences.\r\n\r\nThe G. M. and grand officers form around the Lodge, all kneeling.\r\n\r\nA piece of solemn music is performed while the Lodge is being uncovered,\r\nafter which the first clause of the consecration prayer is rehearsed by\r\nthe Grand Chaplain, as follows:\r\n\r\nGreat Architect of the Universe; Maker and Ruler of all worlds. Deign\r\nfrom Thy Celestial Temple, from the realms of light and glory, to bless\r\nus in all the purposes of our present assembly. We humbly invoke Thee\r\nto give us at this, and at all times, Wisdom in all our doings, Strength\r\nof mind in all our difficulties, and the Beauty of harmony in all our\r\ncommunications. Permit us, O Thou author of life and light, great source\r\nof love and happiness, solemnly to consecrate this Lodge to Thy honor\r\nand glory. Amen.\r\n\r\nResponse by the Officers of the Grand Lodge:\r\n\r\nAs it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without\r\nend. Amen.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Officers will then rise.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsecration.\r\n\r\nThe Deputy Grand Master will step forward and present the Vessel of Corn\r\n(wheat) to the Grand Master, who sprinkles a portion of it upon the\r\nsymbol of the Lodge, saying:\r\n\r\nMay the Giver of every good and perfect gift strengthen this Lodge in\r\nall its philanthropic undertakings.\r\n\r\nThe following may then be sung:\r\n\r\n    When once of old, in Israel,\r\n      Our brethren wrought with toil,\r\n    Jehovah's blessings on them fell,\r\n      In showers of Corn and Wine and Oil.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, the Senior Grand Warden presents the Vessel of Wine,\r\nwhich is sprinkled on the Lodge by the Grand Master, saying:\r\n\r\nMay this Lodge be continually refreshed at the pure fountain of Masonic\r\nvirtue.\r\n\r\nThe following may then be sung:\r\n\r\n    When then a shrine to him above\r\n      They built, with worship sin to foil,\r\n    On threshold and on corner-stone\r\n      They poured out Corn and Wine and Oil.\r\n\r\nThe Junior Grand Warden then presents the Vessel of Oil, which is used\r\nin the same manner, the Grand Master saying:\r\n\r\nMay the Supreme Ruler of the Universe preserve this Lodge in peace, and\r\nvouchsafe to it every blessing.\r\n\r\nThe following may then be sung:\r\n\r\n    And we have come, fraternal bands,\r\n      With joy and pride and prosperous spoil,\r\n    To honor him by votive hands,\r\n      With streams of Corn and Wine and Oil.\r\n\r\nEach vessel after use is placed upon the table.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Master then orders the Officers of the Grand Lodge to kneel as\r\nbefore, when the Grand Chaplain will rehearse the remaining portion of\r\nthe consecration prayer:\r\n\r\nGrant, O Lord, our God, that those who are now about to be invested with\r\nthe government of this Lodge may be endowed with wisdom to instruct\r\ntheir brethren in their duties. May brotherly love, relief and truth\r\nalways prevail among the members of this Lodge. May this bond of union\r\ncontinue to strengthen the Lodges throughout the world. Bless all our\r\nbrethren, wherever dispersed, and grant speedy relief to all who are\r\neither oppressed or distressed. We affectionately commend to Thee all\r\nthe members of this whole family; may they increase in grace, in the\r\nknowledge of Thee, and in love to each other. Finally, may we finish all\r\nour work here below, with Thy approbation; and then may our transition\r\nfrom this earthly abode be to Thy heavenly Temple above, there to enjoy\r\nlight and glory, and bliss ineffable and eternal. Amen.\r\n\r\nResponse: (By the Officers of the Grand Lodge.) As it was in the\r\nbeginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.\r\n\r\nA short piece of solemn music is then performed, during which the Grand\r\nOfficers will rise.\r\n\r\n\r\nDedication.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Master steps forward, and extending his hands over the emblem\r\nof the Lodge, exclaims:\r\n\r\nTo the memory of the Holy Saints John, we dedicate this Lodge. May every\r\nbrother revere their character and imitate their virtues.\r\n\r\nResponse: (By the brethren.) As it was in the beginning, is now, and\r\never shall be, world without end. Amen.\r\n\r\nThe Officers of the Grand Lodge will then about face, and stand, while\r\nthe brethren of the new Lodge, under direction of the Grand Marshal,\r\nmake a circuit in procession, single file, and salute the Grand Officers\r\nwith their hands crossed upon their breasts, left over right, and heads\r\nslightly bowed while passing. Upon the completion of this ceremony, the\r\nbrethren will resume position, facing inward. The Officers of the Grand\r\nLodge will also resume original position. The Grand Master will call up,\r\nwith his gavel, all present, and then proceed to\r\n\r\n\r\nConstitute the Lodge.\r\n\r\nGrand Master: In the name of the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of the\r\nState of Arkansas, I now constitute and form you, my beloved brethren,\r\ninto a Regular Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons. From henceforth we\r\nempower you to meet as a Regular Lodge, constituted in conformity to\r\nthe rites of our institution, and the charges of our ancient and\r\nhonorable Fraternity; and may the Supreme Architect of the Universe\r\nprosper, direct and counsel you in all your doings.\r\n\r\nResponse by the brethren: So mote it be.\r\n\r\nThe Officers of the Grand Lodge will, under the direction of the Grand\r\nMarshal, give the Full Grand Honors. The Grand Marshal will then slowly\r\nreplace the covering on the Lodge, during which a choir should chant--\r\n\r\n    \"Glory be to God on High.\"\r\n\r\nThe Grand Marshal will then conduct the Grand Master to his chair, and\r\ninstruct the officers of the Grand Lodge to resume their respective\r\nstations; and the members of the new Lodge to resume their seats. During\r\nthese movements instrumental music should be performed.\r\n\r\nGrand Master: (Calls up the assembly.) Worshipful Grand Marshal, you\r\nwill make proclamation that ...... Lodge, No. ......, has been regularly\r\nconstituted.\r\n\r\nGrand Marshal: I am directed by the Most Worshipful Grand Master to\r\nproclaim, and I do hereby proclaim, that ...... Lodge, No. ......, has\r\nbeen regularly constituted, and duly registered as such in the Grand\r\nLodge of Arkansas. This proclamation is made from the East, (one knock\r\nby G. M.); from the West, (one knock by the S. G. W.); from the South,\r\n(one knock by the J. G. W.); once, twice, thrice; the Craft will take\r\ndue notice and govern itself accordingly. The Grand Honors are given.\r\n\r\nGrand Master seats the brethren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAYING CORNER STONES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese ceremonies are conducted only by the Grand Master in person, or by\r\nsome brother acting for him, under special dispensation, assisted by the\r\nofficers of the Grand Lodge, and such of the Craft as may be invited, or\r\nwho may choose to attend, either as Lodges, or as individual brethren.\r\n\r\nNo corner-stone should be laid with Masonic ceremonies, except those of\r\nacknowledged public structures, or buildings which are to be used for\r\nMasonic purposes; and then only by special request of the proper\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nThe Lodge or Lodges in the place where the building is to be erected,\r\nmay invite such neighboring Lodges, and other Masonic bodies, as they\r\nmay deem proper. The Chief Magistrate, and other Officers of the place,\r\nshould also be invited to attend on the occasion.\r\n\r\nAt the time appointed for the ceremony, a sufficient number of brethren\r\nto act as Grand Officers are convened in a suitable place, where a\r\nSpecial Communication of the Grand Lodge will be opened on the Third\r\nDegree, and proper instructions given by the Grand Master; after which,\r\nthe Officers of the Grand Lodge, under the direction of the Grand\r\nMarshal, will form in the following order:\r\n\r\n                           Grand Tyler.\r\n                       (with drawn sword.)\r\n\r\n                          Master Masons.\r\n\r\n    Grand Steward.          A Brother.         Grand Steward.\r\n    (carrying rod.)      (carrying Bible,     (carrying rod.)\r\n                       Square and Compass,\r\n                          on a cushion.)\r\n\r\n                         Grand Chaplain.\r\n\r\n          Grand Secretary,               Grand Treasurer,\r\n    (carrying scroll, containing     (in charge of the box[A]\r\n       list of articles to be          to be deposited under\r\n          placed under the               the corner-stone.)\r\n           corner-stone.)\r\n\r\n    Gr'd Steward,     Past Gr'd Officers,[B]    Gr'd Steward,\r\n    (carrying rod.)   (in the order of their  (carrying rod.)\r\n    G                   rank, two abreast.)\r\n    R\r\n    A                 Principal Architect,[C]\r\n    N          (carrying Square, Level and Plumb.)\r\n    D\r\n\r\n    M       Jr. Grand Warden,         Sr. Grand Warden,\r\n    A   (carrying vessel of oil.)  (carrying vessel of wine.)\r\n    R\r\n    S                 Deputy Grand Master.\r\n    H              (carrying vessel of corn.)\r\n    A\r\n    L               Master of Oldest Lodge,\r\n    .          (carrying book of constitutions.)\r\n\r\n    Jr. Grand Deacon,     Grand Master.     Sr. Grand Deacon,\r\n    (carrying rod.)                           (carrying rod.)\r\n\r\nThe procession thus formed will proceed to join the general procession,\r\nif any, and march to the place where the ceremony is to be performed.\r\n\r\n[A] This box may be carried by the Treasurer, or be sent in advance to\r\nthe site of the corner-stone, as circumstances may dictate.\r\n\r\n[B] In the absence of Past Grand Officers, these Stewards will support\r\nthe Deputy Grand Master and Grand Warden.\r\n\r\n[C] If the architect of the building is not a member of the Masonic\r\nFraternity, the Square, Level and Plumb will be carried by a brother\r\nappointed for the purpose, who will deliver them to the architect on\r\narriving at the corner-stone.\r\n\r\nWhen a procession is composed of other than the officers of the Grand\r\nLodge and Master Masons, it should be formed in the following order:\r\n\r\n    G                          Music.\r\n    R\r\n    A M                      Military.\r\n    N A\r\n    D R          Civic Societies and Organizations.\r\n      S\r\n      H  Chief Magistrate, Mayor or other Official Guests.\r\n      A\r\n      L               Knights Templar Escort.\r\n      .\r\n                            Grand Lodge.\r\n\r\nShould any Masonic body other than those above named appear, they will\r\nbe assigned an appropriate place in the procession.\r\n\r\nA triumphal arch is usually erected near the place where the ceremony is\r\nto be performed; and the corner-stone should have engraved on its face\r\nthe words, \"Laid by the Masonic Fraternity,\" with the date, the year of\r\nMasonry, the name of the Grand Master, and such other particulars as may\r\nbe deemed proper.\r\n\r\nWhen the head of the procession reaches the Arch, it will open to the\r\nright and left, facing inward. The Grand Master, uncovering, preceded by\r\nthe Grand Marshal and Grand Tyler, and followed by the other Grand\r\nOfficers and the Chief Magistrate and civil officers of the place, will\r\npass through the lines and ascend to the platform. As the Grand Master\r\nand others advance, the remainder of the procession will counter-march\r\nand surround the platform.\r\n\r\nThe stone should be suspended about six feet from its bed, by a machine\r\nhaving suitable arrangements for slowly lowering it to its place. All\r\nbeing in readiness--\r\n\r\nThe Grand Master will command silence and address the assembly,\r\nannouncing the purposes of the occasion, etc., concluding as follows:\r\n\r\nThe teachings of Freemasonry inculcate, that in all our works, great or\r\nsmall, begun and finished, we should seek the aid of Almighty God. It is\r\nour first duty, then, to invoke the blessing of the great Architect of\r\nthe Universe upon the work in which we are about to engage. I therefore\r\ncommand the utmost silence, and call upon all to unite with our Grand\r\nChaplain in an address to the Throne of Grace.\r\n\r\nThe brethren uncover, while the Grand Chaplain delivers the following,\r\nor some other appropriate\r\n\r\n\r\nPrayer.\r\n\r\nAlmighty God! who hath given us grace at this time, with one accord, to\r\nmake our common supplication unto Thee, and dost promise, that where two\r\nor three are gathered together in Thy name, Thou wilt grant their\r\nrequest; fulfill now, O Lord! the desires and petitions of Thy servants,\r\nas may be most expedient for them; granting us in this world, knowledge\r\nof Thy truth; and in the world to come, life everlasting. Amen.\r\n\r\nResponse: So mote it be.\r\n\r\nThe choir may then sing an Ode, or a piece of instrumental music may be\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeposit of Memorials.\r\n\r\nGrand Master: R. W. Brother Grand Treasurer, it has ever been the\r\ncustom, on occasions like the present, to deposit within a cavity in\r\nthe stone, placed in the north-east corner of the edifice, certain\r\nmemorials of the period at which it was erected; so that in the lapse of\r\nages, if the fury of the elements, or the slow but certain ravages of\r\ntime, should lay bare its foundation, an enduring record may be found by\r\nsucceeding generations, to bear testimony to the energy, industry and\r\nculture of our time. Has such a deposit been prepared?\r\n\r\nGrand Treasurer: It has, Most Worshipful Grand Master, and the various\r\narticles of which it is composed are safely enclosed within the casket\r\nnow before you.\r\n\r\nGrand Master: R. W. Grand Secretary, you will read for the information\r\nof the brethren and others here assembled, a record of the contents of\r\nthe casket.\r\n\r\nGrand Secretary reads a list of the articles contained in the casket.\r\n\r\nGrand Master: R. W. Grand Treasurer, you will now deposit the casket in\r\nthe cavity beneath the corner-stone, and may the Great Architect of the\r\nUniverse, in His wisdom, grant that ages on ages shall pass away ere it\r\nagain be seen of men.\r\n\r\nGrand Treasurer, assisted by the Grand Secretary, will place the casket\r\nin the cavity prepared, and report:\r\n\r\nMost Worshipful Grand Master, your orders have been duly executed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresentation of Working Tools.\r\n\r\nPrincipal Architect delivers the working tools to the Grand Master, who\r\nretains the Trowel, and presents the Square, Level and Plumb to the\r\nDeputy Grand Master, Senior and Junior Grand Warden, respectively,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\nRight Worshipful Brethren, you will receive the implements of your\r\noffice. With your assistance and that of the Craft, I will now proceed\r\nto lay the corner-stone of this edifice, according to the custom of our\r\nFraternity. Brother Grand Marshal, you will direct the Craftsmen to\r\nfurnish the cement, and prepare to lower the stone.\r\n\r\n\r\nLaying Stone.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Master will then spread a portion of the cement. The stone is\r\nthen lowered slowly, during which there should be appropriate music. The\r\nGrand Master then says:\r\n\r\n\r\nTrial of Stone.\r\n\r\nR. W. Deputy Grand Master, what is the proper implement of your office?\r\n\r\nD. G. Master: The Square.\r\n\r\nG. M.: What are its moral and Masonic uses?\r\n\r\nD. G. M.: To square our actions by the rule of virtue, and prove our\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nG. M.: Apply the implement of your office to that portion of the stone\r\nthat needs to be proved, and make report.\r\n\r\nThe Square is applied to the four corners.\r\n\r\nD. G. M.: Most Worshipful Grand Master, I find the stone to be square.\r\nThe Craftsmen have done their duty.\r\n\r\nG. M.: R. W. Senior Grand Warden, what is the proper implement of your\r\noffice?\r\n\r\nS. G. W.: The Level.\r\n\r\nG. M.: What are its Masonic uses?\r\n\r\nS. G. W.: Morally, it teaches Equality; and by it we prove our work.\r\n\r\nG. M.: Apply the implement of your office to that portion of the\r\ncorner-stone that needs to be proved, and make report.\r\n\r\nLevel is applied to the top surface.\r\n\r\nS. G. W.: Most Worshipful Grand Master, I find the stone to be level.\r\nThe Craftsmen have done their duty.\r\n\r\nG. M.: R. W. Junior Warden, what is the proper implement of your office?\r\n\r\nJ. G. W.: The Plumb.\r\n\r\nG. M.: What are its moral and Masonic uses?\r\n\r\nJ. G. W.: Morally, it teaches rectitude of conduct; and by it we prove\r\nour work.\r\n\r\nG. M.: Apply the implement of your office to that portion of the\r\ncorner-stone that needs to be proved, and make report.\r\n\r\nThe Plumb is applied to the sides of the stone.\r\n\r\nJ. G. W.: Most Worshipful Grand Master, I find the stone to be plumb.\r\nThe Craftsmen have done their duty.\r\n\r\nGrand Master (striking the stone three times with his gavel), says:\r\n\r\nThis corner-stone has been tested by the proper implements of Masonry. I\r\nfind that the Craftsmen have skillfully and faithfully done their duty;\r\nand I do declare the stone to be well formed and trusty, truly laid, and\r\ncorrectly proved according to the rules of our Ancient Craft. May the\r\nbuilding be conducted and completed amid the blessings of Plenty, Health\r\nand Peace.\r\n\r\nResponse by the Craft: So mote it be.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsecration.\r\n\r\nGrand Master: Brother Grand Marshal, you will present the elements of\r\nconsecration to the proper officers.\r\n\r\nGrand Marshal presents vessel of corn to the D. G. M.; the wine to the\r\nS. G. W.; and the oil to the J. G. W.\r\n\r\nDeputy Grand Master advances with the corn, scattering it on the stone,\r\nand says:\r\n\r\nI scatter this corn as an emblem of Plenty; may the blessings of\r\nbounteous Heaven be showered upon us, and upon all like patriotic and\r\nimportant undertakings, and inspire the hearts of the people with\r\nvirtue, wisdom and gratitude.\r\n\r\nResponse by the Craft: So mote it be.\r\n\r\nSenior Grand Warden advances with the vessel of wine, pouring it on the\r\nstone, and says:\r\n\r\nI pour this wine as an emblem of Joy and Gladness. May the great Ruler\r\nof the Universe bless and prosper our National, State and City\r\nGovernments; preserve the union of the States in harmony and brotherly\r\nlove, which shall endure through all time.\r\n\r\nResponse by the Craft: So mote it be.\r\n\r\nJunior Warden advances with the vessel of oil, pouring it on the stone,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\nI pour this oil as an emblem of Peace; may its blessings abide with us\r\ncontinually; and may the Grand Master of Heaven and Earth shelter and\r\nprotect the widow and orphan, and vouchsafe to them, and to the\r\nbereaved, the afflicted and sorrowing, everywhere, the enjoyment of\r\nevery good and perfect gift.\r\n\r\nResponse by the Craft: So mote it be.\r\n\r\nGrand Master, extending his hands, pronounces the following invocation:\r\n\r\nMay corn, wine and oil, and all the necessaries of life, abound among\r\nmen throughout the world. May the blessing of Almighty God be upon this\r\nundertaking. May He protect the workmen from every accident. May the\r\nstructure here to be erected, be planned with Wisdom, supported by\r\nStrength, and adorned in Beauty, and may it be preserved to the latest\r\nages, a monument to the energy and liberality of its founders.\r\n\r\nResponse by the Craft: So mote it be.\r\n\r\n\r\nProclamation.\r\n\r\nGrand Master: (Addressing Architect.) Worthy sir (or brother), having\r\nthus, as Grand Master of Masons, laid the corner-stone of the structure,\r\nI now return to you these implements of Operative Masonry (presents\r\nSquare, Level and Plumb), having full confidence in your skill and\r\ncapacity to perform the important duties confided to you, to the\r\nsatisfaction of those who have entrusted you with their fulfillment.\r\n\r\nThe G. M. strikes the stone three times with the gavel, and the public\r\ngrand honors are given.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Master will then make report of his doings, as follows:\r\n\r\nI have the honor to report, that in compliance with the request of the\r\nproper authorities, the corner-stone of the ...... building to be\r\nerected on this site, has been laid successfully, with the ancient\r\nceremonies of the Craft. The Brother Grand Marshal will therefore make\r\nthe proclamation.\r\n\r\nGrand Marshal: In the name of the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of Free\r\nand Accepted Masons of the State of Arkansas, I now proclaim that the\r\ncorner-stone of the structure to be erected, has this day been found\r\ntrue and trusty, and laid according to the old customs, by the Grand\r\nMaster of Masons.\r\n\r\n\r\nClosing Ode.\r\n\r\n\r\nOration.\r\n\r\n\r\nBenediction.\r\n\r\nGlory be to God on High, and on earth peace, good will toward men! O\r\nLord, we most heartily beseech Thee with Thy favor to behold and bless\r\nthis assemblage; pour down Thy mercies, like the dew that falls upon the\r\nmountains, upon Thy servants engaged in the solemn ceremonies of this\r\nday. Bless, we pray Thee, all the workmen who shall be engaged in the\r\nerection of this edifice; keep them from all forms of accidents and\r\nharm; grant them in health and prosperity to live; and finally, we hope,\r\nafter this life, through Thy mercy and forgiveness to attain everlasting\r\njoy and felicity in Thy bright mansion, in Thy holy temple, not made\r\nwith hands, eternal in the heavens. Amen.\r\n\r\nResponse: So mote it be.\r\n\r\nAfter which, the Grand Lodge, with escort, returns to the place whence\r\nit started, and is closed.\r\n\r\nThe Lodges, and other Masonic bodies, return to their respective halls.\r\n\r\n * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEDICATION OF MASONIC HALLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time appointed for the celebration of the ceremony of dedication,\r\nthe Grand Master and his officers, accompanied by the members of the\r\nGrand Lodge, meet in a convenient room, near to the place where the\r\nceremony is to be performed, and the Grand Lodge is opened in ample\r\nform.\r\n\r\nThe procession is then formed, under direction of the Grand Marshal,\r\nwhen the Grand Lodge moves to the hall to be dedicated, in the following\r\norder:\r\n\r\n    Music;\r\n\r\n    Tiler, with drawn sword;\r\n\r\n    Stewards, with white rods;\r\n\r\n    Master Masons;\r\n\r\n    Grand Secretaries;\r\n\r\n    Grand Treasurers;\r\n\r\n    A Past Master, bearing the Holy Writings, Square and Compass,\r\n    supported by two Stewards, with rods;\r\n\r\n    Two Burning Tapers, borne by two Past Masters;\r\n\r\n    Chaplain and Orator;\r\n\r\n    Past Grand Wardens;\r\n\r\n    Past Deputy Grand Masters;\r\n\r\n    Past Grand Masters;\r\n\r\n    The Globes;\r\n\r\n    Junior Grand Warden, carrying a silver vessel with corn;\r\n\r\n    Senior Grand Warden, carrying a silver vessel with wine;\r\n\r\n    Deputy Grand Master, carrying a golden vessel with oil;\r\n\r\n    The Lodge,\r\n    Covered with white linen, carried by four Brethren;\r\n\r\n    Master of the oldest Lodge, carrying Book of Constitutions;\r\n\r\n    Grand Master,\r\n    Supported by two Deacons, with rods.\r\n\r\nWhen the Grand Officers arrive at the center of the Lodge room, the\r\nGrand honors are given.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Officers then repair to their respective stations.\r\n\r\nThe Lodge is placed in front of the altar, toward the East, and the gold\r\nand silver vessels and lights are placed around it.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements being completed, the following or some other\r\nappropriate Ode is sung:\r\n\r\n    Master Supreme! accept our praise;\r\n      Still bless this consecrated band;\r\n    Parent of light! illume our ways,\r\n      And guide us by thy sovereign hand.\r\n\r\n    May Faith, Hope, Charity, divine,\r\n      Here hold their undivided reign;\r\n    Friendship and Harmony combine\r\n      To soothe our cares--to banish pain.\r\n\r\n    May pity dwell within each breast,\r\n      Relief attend the suffering poor;\r\n    Thousands by this, our Lodge, be blest,\r\n      Till worth, distress'd, shall want no more.\r\n\r\nThe Master of the Lodge to which the hall to be dedicated belongs, then\r\nrises, and addresses the Grand Master as follows:\r\n\r\nMost Worshipful: The brethren of ...... Lodge, being animated with a\r\ndesire to promote the honor and interest of the Craft, have erected a\r\nMasonic Hall, for their convenience and accommodation. They are desirous\r\nthat the same should be examined by the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge; and\r\nif it should meet their approbation, that it be solemnly dedicated to\r\nMasonic purposes, agreeably to ancient form and usage.\r\n\r\nThe Architect or Brother who has had the management of the structure\r\nthen addresses the Grand Master as follows:\r\n\r\nMost Worshipful: Having been entrusted with the superintendence and\r\nmanagement of the workmen employed in the construction of this edifice;\r\nand having, according to the best of my ability, accomplished the task\r\nassigned me, I now return my thanks for the honor of this appointment,\r\nand beg leave to surrender up the implements which were committed to my\r\ncare, when the foundation of this fabric was laid, (presenting to the\r\nGrand Master the Square, Level and Plumb), humbly hoping that the\r\nexertions which have been made on this occasion will be crowned with\r\nyour approbation, and that of the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge.\r\n\r\nTo which the Grand Master replies:\r\n\r\nBrother Architect: The skill and fidelity displayed in the execution of\r\nthe trust reposed in you at the commencement of this undertaking, have\r\nsecured the entire approbation of the Grand Lodge; and they sincerely\r\npray that this edifice may continue a lasting monument of the taste,\r\nspirit, and liberality of its founders.\r\n\r\nThe Deputy Grand Master then rises, and says:\r\n\r\nMost Worshipful: The hall in which we are now assembled, and the plan\r\nupon which it has been constructed, having met with your approbation,\r\nit is the desire of the Fraternity that it should be now dedicated,\r\naccording to ancient form and usage.\r\n\r\nThe Lodge is then uncovered, and a procession is made around it in the\r\nfollowing form, during which solemn music is played.\r\n\r\n    Grand Tiler, with drawn sword;\r\n\r\n    A Past Master, with light;\r\n\r\n    A Past Master, with Bible, Square and Compass,\r\n    on a velvet cushion;\r\n\r\n    Two Past Masters, each with a light;\r\n\r\n    Grand Secretary and Treasurer, with emblems;\r\n\r\n    Grand Junior Warden, with vessel of corn;\r\n\r\n    Grand Senior Warden, with vessel of wine;\r\n\r\n    Deputy Grand Master, with vessel of oil;\r\n\r\n    Grand Master;\r\n\r\n    Two Stewards, with rods.\r\n\r\nWhen the procession arrives at the East, it halts; the music ceases, and\r\nthe Grand Chaplain makes the following\r\n\r\n\r\nConsecration Prayer.\r\n\r\nAlmighty and ever-glorious and gracious Lord God, Creator of all things,\r\nand Governor of everything Thou hast made, mercifully look upon Thy\r\nservants, now assembled in Thy name and in Thy presence, and bless and\r\nprosper all our works begun, continued, and ended in thee. Graciously\r\nbestow upon us Wisdom, in all our doings; Strength of mind in all our\r\ndifficulties, and the Beauty of harmony and holiness in all our\r\ncommunications and work. Let Faith be the foundation of our Hope, and\r\nCharity the fruit of our obedience to Thy revealed will.\r\n\r\nMay all the proper work of our institution that may be done in this\r\nhouse be such as Thy wisdom may approve and Thy goodness prosper. And,\r\nfinally, graciously be pleased, O Thou Sovereign Architect of the\r\nUniverse, to bless the Craft, wheresoever dispersed, and make them true\r\nand faithful to Thee, to their neighbor, and to themselves. And when the\r\ntime of our labor is drawing near to an end, and the pillar of our\r\nstrength is declining to the ground, graciously enable us to pass\r\nthrough the \"valley of the shadow of death,\" supported by Thy rod and\r\nThy staff, to those mansions beyond the skies where love, and peace, and\r\njoy forever reign before Thy throne. Amen.\r\n\r\nResponse: So mote it be!\r\n\r\nAll the other brethren keep their places, and assist in singing the Ode,\r\nwhich continues during the procession, excepting only at the intervals\r\nof dedication.\r\n\r\n\r\nSong.\r\n\r\nTune--Old Hundred.\r\n\r\n    Genius of Masonry, descend,\r\n      And with thee bring thy spotless train,\r\n    Constant our sacred rites attend,\r\n      While we adore thy peaceful reign.\r\n\r\nThe first procession being made around the Lodge, the Grand Master\r\nhaving reached the East, the Grand Junior Warden presents the vessel of\r\nCorn to the G. Master, saying:\r\n\r\nMost Worshipful: In the dedications of Masonic Halls, it has been of\r\nimmemorial custom to pour corn upon the Lodge, as an emblem of\r\nnourishment. I, therefore, present you this vessel of corn, to be\r\nemployed by you according to ancient usage.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Master then, striking thrice with his mallet pours the corn\r\nupon the Lodge, saying:\r\n\r\nIn the name of the great Jehovah, to whom be all honor and glory, I do\r\nsolemnly dedicate this hall to Freemasonry.\r\n\r\nThe grand honors are given.\r\n\r\n    Bring with thee Virtue, brightest maid!\r\n      Bring Love, bring Truth, bring Friendship here;\r\n    While social Mirth shall lend her aid\r\n      To soothe the wrinkled brow of Care.\r\n\r\nThe second procession is then made around the Lodge, and the Grand\r\nSenior Warden presents the vessel of wine to the Grand Master, saying:\r\n\r\nMost Worshipful: Wine, the emblem of refreshment, having been used by\r\nour ancient brethren in the dedication and consecration of their Lodges,\r\nI present you this vessel of wine, to be used on the present occasion\r\naccording to ancient Masonic form.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Master then sprinkles the wine upon the Lodge, saying:\r\n\r\nIn the name of the holy Saints John, I do solemnly dedicate this hall to\r\nVirtue.\r\n\r\nThe grand honors are twice repeated.\r\n\r\n    Bring Charity! with goodness crowned,\r\n      Encircled in thy heavenly robe!\r\n    Diffuse thy blessings all around,\r\n      To every corner of the Globe!\r\n\r\nThe third procession is then made round the Lodge, and the Deputy Grand\r\nMaster presents the vessel of oil to the Grand Master, saying:\r\n\r\nMost Worshipful: I present you, to be used according to ancient custom,\r\nthis vessel of oil, an emblem of that joy which should animate every\r\nbosom on the completion of every important undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Master then sprinkles the oil upon the Lodge, saying:\r\n\r\nIn the name of the whole Fraternity, I do solemnly dedicate this hall to\r\nUniversal Benevolence.\r\n\r\nThe grand honors are thrice repeated.\r\n\r\n    To Heaven's high Architect all praise,\r\n      All praise, all gratitude be given,\r\n    Who deigned the human soul to raise,\r\n      By mystic secrets, sprung from Heaven.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Chaplain, standing before the Lodge, then makes the following\r\n\r\n\r\nInvocation.\r\n\r\nAnd may the Lord, the giver of every good and perfect gift, bless the\r\nbrethren here assembled, in all their lawful undertakings, and grant to\r\neach one of them, in needful supply, the corn of nourishment, the wine\r\nof refreshment, and the oil of joy. Amen.\r\n\r\nResponse: So mote it be.\r\n\r\nThe Lodge is then covered, and the Grand Master retires to his chair.\r\n\r\nThe following or an appropriate original oration may then be delivered,\r\nand the ceremonies conclude with music:\r\n\r\nBrethren: The ceremonies we have performed are not unmeaning rites, nor\r\nthe amusing pageants of an idle hour, but have a solemn and instructive\r\nimport. Suffer me to point it out to you, and to impress upon your minds\r\nthe ennobling sentiments they are so well adapted to convey.\r\n\r\nThis Hall, designed and built by Wisdom, supported by Strength, and\r\nadorned in Beauty, we are first to consecrate in the name of the great\r\nJehovah; which teaches us, in all our works, begun and finished, to\r\nacknowledge, adore, and magnify Him. It reminds us, also, in His fear to\r\nenter the door of the Lodge, to put our trust in him while passing its\r\ntrials, and to hope in Him for the reward of its labors.\r\n\r\nLet, then, its altar be devoted to His service, and its lofty arch\r\nresound with His praise! May the eye which seeth in secret witness here\r\nthe sincere and unaffected piety which withdraws from the engagements of\r\nthe world to silence and privacy, that it may be exercised with less\r\ninterruption and less ostentation.\r\n\r\nOur march round the Lodge reminds us of the travels of human life, in\r\nwhich Masonry is an enlightened, a safe, and a pleasant path. Its\r\ntesselated pavement of Mosaic-work intimates to us the chequered\r\ndiversity and uncertainty of human affairs. Our step is time; our\r\nprogression, eternity.\r\n\r\nFollowing our ancient Constitutions, with mystic rites we dedicate this\r\nHall to the honor of Freemasonry.\r\n\r\nOur best attachments are due to the Craft. In its prosperity, we find\r\nour joy; and, in paying it honor, we honor ourselves. But its worth\r\ntranscends our encomiums, and its glory will outsound our praise.\r\n\r\nBrethren: It is our pride that we have our names on the records of\r\nFreemasonry. May it be our high ambition that they should shed a luster\r\non the immortal page!\r\n\r\nThe hall is also dedicated to Virtue.\r\n\r\nThis worthy appropriation will always be duly regarded while the moral\r\nduties which our sublime lectures inculcate, with affecting and\r\nimpressive pertinency, are cherished in our hearts and illustrated in\r\nour lives.\r\n\r\nAs Freemasonry aims to enliven the spirit of Philanthropy, and promote\r\nthe cause of Charity, so we dedicate this Hall to Universal Benevolence;\r\nin the assurance that every brother will dedicate his affections and his\r\nabilities to the same generous purpose; that while he displays a warm\r\nand cordial affection to those who are of the Fraternity, he will extend\r\nhis benevolent regards and good wishes to the whole family of mankind.\r\n\r\nSuch, my brethren, is the significant meaning of the solemn rites we\r\nhave just performed, because such are the peculiar duties of every\r\nLodge. I need not enlarge upon them now, nor show how they diverge, as\r\nrays from a center, to enlighten, to improve, and to cheer the whole\r\ncircle of life. Their import and their application is familiar to you\r\nall. In their knowledge and their exercise may you fulfill the high\r\npurposes of the Masonic Institution.\r\n\r\nHow many pleasing considerations, my brethren, attend the present\r\ninterview! While in almost every other association of men, political\r\nanimosities, contentions, and wars interrupt the progress of Humanity\r\nand the cause of Benevolence, it is our distinguished privilege to dwell\r\ntogether in peace, and engage in plans to perfect individual and social\r\nhappiness. While in many other nations our Order is viewed by\r\npoliticians with suspicion, and by the ignorant with apprehension, in\r\nthis country its members are too much respected, and its principles too\r\nwell known, to make it the object of jealousy or mistrust. Our private\r\nassemblies are unmolested; and our public celebrations attract a more\r\ngeneral approbation of the Fraternity. Indeed, its importance, its\r\ncredit, and, we trust, its usefulness, are advancing to a height unknown\r\nin any former age. The present occasion gives fresh evidence of the\r\nincreasing affection of its friends; and this noble apartment, fitted up\r\nin a style of such elegance and convenience, does honor to Freemasonry,\r\nas well as reflects the highest credit on the respectable Lodge for\r\nwhose accommodation and at whose expense it is erected.\r\n\r\nWe offer our best congratulations to the Worshipful Master, Wardens,\r\nOfficers, and Members of ...... Lodge. We commend their zeal, and hope\r\nit will meet with the most ample recompense. May their Hall be the happy\r\nresort of Piety, Virtue, and Benevolence! May it be protected from\r\naccident, and long remain a monument of their attachment to Freemasonry!\r\nMay their Lodge continue to flourish; their union to strengthen; and\r\ntheir happiness to abound!--And when they, and we all, shall be removed\r\nfrom the labors of the earthly Lodge, may we be admitted to the\r\nbrotherhood of the perfect, in the building of God, the Hall not made\r\nwith hands, eternal in the heavens!\r\n\r\nThe Grand Lodge is again formed in procession, as at first, returns to\r\nthe room where it was opened, and is closed in ample form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMASONIC FUNERAL SERVICE\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Directions.\r\n\r\n1. No Freemason can be buried with the formalities of the Fraternity\r\nunless it be at his own request or that of some of his family,\r\ncommunicated to the Master of the Lodge of which he was a member at the\r\ntime of his death, foreigners or sojourners excepted; nor unless he has\r\nreceived the Master Mason degree; and to this rule there can be no\r\nexception.\r\n\r\n2. Fellow Crafts or Entered Apprentices are not entitled to these\r\nobsequies, nor can they be allowed in the procession, as Masons, at a\r\nMasonic funeral.\r\n\r\n3. The Master of the Lodge, having received notice of the death of a\r\nbrother (the deceased having attained the degree of Master Mason), and\r\nof his request to be buried with the ceremonies of the Craft, fixes the\r\nday and hour for the funeral (unless previously arranged by the friends\r\nor relatives of the deceased), and issues his order to the Secretary to\r\nsummon the Lodge. Members of other Lodges may be invited, but they\r\nshould join with the Lodge performing the ceremonies.\r\n\r\n4. Upon the death of a sojourner who had expressed a wish to be buried\r\nwith Masonic ceremonies, the duties prescribed in Article 3 will devolve\r\nupon the Master of the Lodge within whose jurisdiction the death may\r\nhave occurred, unless there be more than one Lodge in the place; and if\r\nso the funeral service will be performed by the oldest Lodge, unless\r\notherwise mutually arranged.\r\n\r\n5. Whenever other societies or the military unite with Masons in the\r\nburial of a Mason, the body of the deceased must be in charge of the\r\nLodge having jurisdiction, and the services should, in all respects, be\r\nconducted as if none but Masons were present.\r\n\r\n6. If the deceased was a Grand or Past Grand Officer the Officers of the\r\nGrand Lodge should be invited; when the Master of the Lodge having\r\njurisdiction will invite the Grand Officer present who has attained the\r\nhighest rank to conduct the burial service.\r\n\r\n7. The pallbearers should be Masons, and should be selected by the\r\nMaster, with the approval of the family of the deceased. If the deceased\r\nwas a member of a Chapter or other Masonic body, a portion of the\r\npallbearers should be taken from these bodies severally.\r\n\r\n8. The proper clothing to be worn at a Masonic funeral is black or dark\r\nclothes, a black necktie, white gloves, and a white apron, and a sprig\r\nof evergreen on the left breast. The Master's gavel, the Wardens'\r\ncolumns, the Deacons' and Stewards' rods, the Tiler's sword and the\r\nMarshal's baton, should be trimmed with black crape. The officers of the\r\nLodge and Grand Officers should wear their official jewels.\r\n\r\n9. As soon as the remains are placed in the coffin there should be\r\nplaced upon it a plain white lambskin apron.\r\n\r\n10. If a Past or Present Grand Master, Deputy Grand Master, or Grand\r\nWarden, should join the procession of a Lodge, proper attention must be\r\npaid to them. They take place after the Master of the Lodge. Two\r\nDeacons, with white rods, should be appointed by the Master to attend\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n11. When the head of the procession shall have arrived at the place of\r\ninterment, or where the services are to be performed, the lines should\r\nbe opened, and the highest officer in rank, preceded by the Marshal and\r\nTiler, pass through, and the others follow in order.\r\n\r\n12. Upon arriving at the entrance to the cemetery, the brethren should\r\nmarch in open order to the tomb or grave. If the body is to be placed in\r\nthe former, the Tiler should take his place in front of the open door,\r\nand the lines be spread so as to form a circle. The coffin should be\r\ndeposited within the circle, and the Stewards and Deacons should cross\r\ntheir rods over it. The bearers should take their places on either\r\nside--the mourners at the foot of the coffin, and the Master and other\r\nofficers at the head. After the coffin has been placed in the tomb, the\r\nStewards should cross their rods over the door and the Deacons over the\r\nMaster. If the body is to be deposited in the earth, an oblong square\r\nshould be formed around the grave, the body being placed on rests over\r\nit; the Stewards should cross their rods over the foot, and the Deacons\r\nthe head, and retain their places throughout the services.\r\n\r\n13. After the clergymen shall have performed the religious services of\r\nthe church, the Masonic services should begin.\r\n\r\n14. When a number of Lodges join in a funeral procession, the position\r\nof the youngest Lodge is at the head, or right, of the procession, and\r\nthe oldest at the end, or left, excepting that the Lodge of which\r\ndeceased was a member walks nearest the corpse.\r\n\r\n15. A Lodge in procession is to be strictly under the discipline of the\r\nLodge room; therefore no brother can enter the procession or leave it\r\nwithout express permission from the Master, conveyed through the\r\nMarshal. The Lodge is open and not at refreshment.\r\n\r\n\r\nService in Lodge Room.\r\n\r\nThe brethren having assembled at the lodge room, the Lodge will be\r\nopened briefly on the Third Degree; the purpose of the communication\r\nmust be stated, and remarks upon the character of the deceased may be\r\nmade by the Master and brethren, when the service will commence, all the\r\nbrethren standing:\r\n\r\nMaster: What man is he that liveth and shall not see death? Shall he\r\ndeliver his soul from the land of the grave?\r\n\r\nS. W.: His days are as grass; as a flower of the field so he\r\nflourisheth.\r\n\r\nJ. W.: For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place\r\nthereof shall know it no more.\r\n\r\nM.: Where is now our departed brother?\r\n\r\nS. W.: He dwelleth in night; he sojourneth in darkness.\r\n\r\nJ. W.: Man walketh in a vain shadow; he heapeth up riches, and cannot\r\ntell who shall gather them.\r\n\r\nM.: When he dieth, he shall carry nothing away; his glory shall not\r\ndescend after him.\r\n\r\nS. W.: For he brought nothing into the world, and it is certain he can\r\ncarry nothing out.\r\n\r\nJ. W.: The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name\r\nof the Lord.\r\n\r\nM.: The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in\r\nmercy.\r\n\r\nS. W.: God is our salvation; our glory and the rock of our strength; and\r\nour refuge is in God.\r\n\r\nJ. W.: He hath not dealt with us after our sins, nor rewarded us\r\naccording to our iniquities.\r\n\r\nM.: Can we offer any precious gift acceptable in the sight of the Lord\r\nto redeem our brother?\r\n\r\nS. W.: We are poor and needy. We are without gift or ransom.\r\n\r\nJ. W.: Be merciful unto us, O Lord, be merciful unto us; for we trust in\r\nThee. Our hope and salvation are in Thy patience. Where else can we look\r\nfor mercy?\r\n\r\nM.: Let us endeavor to live the life of the righteous, that our last end\r\nmay be like his.\r\n\r\nS. W.: The Lord is gracious and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.\r\n\r\nJ. W.: God is our God forever and ever; He will be our guide, even unto\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nM.: Shall our brother's name and virtues be lost upon the earth forever?\r\n\r\nResponse: We will remember and cherish them in our hearts.\r\n\r\nM.: I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me: \"Write from henceforth,\r\nBlessed are the dead who die in the Lord! Even so, saith the Spirit; for\r\nthey rest from their labors.\"\r\n\r\nHere the Master will take the Sacred Roll (a sheet of parchment or paper\r\nprepared for the purpose), on which have been inscribed the name, age,\r\ndate of initiation or affiliation, date of death, and any matters that\r\nmay be interesting to the brethren, and shall read the same aloud, and\r\nshall then say:\r\n\r\nAlmighty Father! in Thy hands we leave, with humble submission, the soul\r\nof our departed brother.\r\n\r\nResponse; Amen! So mote it be.\r\n\r\nThe Masonic funeral honors should then be given once; the brethren to\r\nrespond:\r\n\r\nThe will of God is accomplished. Amen. So mote it be!\r\n\r\nThe Master should then deposit the Roll in the archives of the Lodge.\r\n\r\nThe following or some appropriate Hymn may be sung:\r\n\r\n\r\nOde--Air, Balerma. C. M.\r\n\r\n    Few are thy days, and full of woe,\r\n      O man, of woman born!\r\n    Thy doom is written, \"Dust thou art,\r\n      And shalt to dust return.\"\r\n\r\n    Behold the emblem of thy state\r\n      In flowers that bloom and die;\r\n    Or in the shadow's fleeting form,\r\n      That mocks the gazer's eye.\r\n\r\n    Determined are the days that fly\r\n      Successive o'er thy head;\r\n    The number'd hour is on the wing,\r\n      That lays thee with the dead.\r\n\r\n    Great God! afflict not, in Thy wrath,\r\n      The short alloted span\r\n    That bounds the few and weary days\r\n      Of pilgrimage to man.\r\n\r\nThe Master or Chaplain will repeat the following or some other\r\nappropriate Prayer:\r\n\r\nAlmighty and Heavenly Father! infinite in wisdom, mercy and goodness,\r\nextend to us the blessings of Thy everlasting grace. Thou alone art a\r\nrefuge and help in trouble and affliction. In this bereavement we look\r\nto Thee for support and consolation. Strengthen our belief that Death\r\nhath no power over a faithful and righteous soul! Though the dust\r\nreturneth to the dust as it was, the spirit returneth unto Thee. As we\r\nmourn the departure of a brother beloved from the circle of our\r\nFraternity, may we trust that he hath entered into a higher brotherhood,\r\nto engage in nobler duties and in heavenly work, to find rest from\r\nearthly labor and refreshment from earthly care. May Thy peace abide\r\nwithin us, to keep us from all evil! Make us grateful for present\r\nbenefits, and crown us with immortal life and honor. And to Thy name\r\nshall be all the glory forever. Amen.\r\n\r\nResponse: So mote it be.\r\n\r\nA procession should then be formed, which will proceed to the church or\r\nthe house of the deceased, in the following order:\r\n\r\n         Tiler, with drawn sword.\r\n         Masters of Ceremony, with white rods.\r\n    M    Master Masons.\r\n    A    Secretary and Treasurer.\r\n    R    Senior and Junior Wardens.\r\n    S    Past Masters.\r\n    H    The Chaplain.\r\n    A    The Three Great Lights\r\n    L    on a cushion, covered with black cloth, carried\r\n    .    by a member of the Lodge.\r\n         The Master,\r\n         supported by two Deacons, with white rods.\r\n\r\nWhen the head of the procession arrives at the entrance to the building,\r\nit should halt and open to the right and left, forming two parallel\r\nlines, when the Marshal, with the Tiler, will pass through the lines and\r\nescort the Master or Grand Officer into the house, the brethren closing\r\nin and following, thus reversing the order of procession; the brethren\r\nwith heads uncovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nService at Church or House of Deceased.\r\n\r\nAfter the religious services have been performed, the Master will take\r\nhis station at the head of the coffin, the Senior Warden at his right,\r\nthe Junior Warden at his left; the Deacons and Stewards, with white rods\r\ncrossed, the former at the head, and the latter at the foot of the\r\ncoffin, the brethren forming a circle around all, when the Masonic\r\nservice will commence by the Chaplain or Master repeating the following\r\nor some other appropriate prayer, in which all the brethren will join:\r\n\r\n(Scripture can be used here.)\r\n\r\n\r\nPrayer.\r\n\r\nOur Father which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come.\r\nThy will be done in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily\r\nbread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass\r\nagainst us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\r\nFor Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever. Amen.\r\n\r\nResponse: So mote it be.\r\n\r\nMaster: Brethren, we are called upon by the imperious mandate of the\r\ndread messenger Death, against whose free entrance within the circle of\r\nour Fraternity the barred doors and Tiler's weapon offer no impediment,\r\nto mourn the loss of one of our companions. The dead body of our beloved\r\nBrother lies in its narrow house before us, overtaken by that fate which\r\nmust sooner or later overtake us all; and which no power or station, no\r\nvirtue or bravery, no wealth or honor, no tears of friends or agonies of\r\nrelatives can avert; teaching an impressive lesson, continually\r\nrepeated, yet soon forgotten, that every one of us must ere long pass\r\nthrough the shadow of death, and dwell in the house of darkness.\r\n\r\nS. Warden: In the midst of life we are in death; of whom may we seek\r\nsuccor but of Thee, O Lord, who for our sins art justly displeased. Thou\r\nknowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts; shut not Thy merciful ears to\r\nour prayer.\r\n\r\nJ. Warden: Lord, let me know my end, and the number of my days; that I\r\nmay be certified how long I have to live.\r\n\r\nMaster: Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble.\r\nHe cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down; he fleeth also as a\r\nshadow, and continueth not. Seeing his days are determined, the number\r\nof his months is with Thee; Thou hast appointed his bounds that he\r\ncannot pass; turn from him that he may rest, till he shall accomplish\r\nhis day. For there is a hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will\r\nsprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. But man\r\ndieth and wasteth away; yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?\r\nAs the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up,\r\nso man lieth down, and riseth not till the heavens be no more.\r\n\r\nS. Warden: Our life is but a span long, and the days of our pilgrimage\r\nare few and full of evil.\r\n\r\nJ. Warden: So teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts\r\nunto wisdom.\r\n\r\nMaster: Man goeth forth to his work and to his labor until the evening\r\nof his day. The labor and work of our brother are finished. As it hath\r\npleased Almighty God to take the soul of our departed brother, may he\r\nfind mercy in the great day when all men shall be judged according to\r\nthe deeds done in the body. We must walk in the light while we have\r\nlight; for the darkness of death may come upon us at a time when we may\r\nnot be prepared. Take heed, therefore, watch and pray; for ye know not\r\nwhen the time is; ye know not when the Master cometh--at even, at\r\nmidnight, or in the morning. We should so regulate our lives by the line\r\nof rectitude and truth that in the evening of our days we may be found\r\nworthy to be called from labor to refreshment, and duly prepared for a\r\ntranslation from the terrestrial to the celestial Lodge, to join the\r\nFraternity of the spirits of just men made perfect.\r\n\r\nS. Warden: Behold, O Lord, we are in distress! Our hearts are turned\r\nwithin us; there is none to comfort us; our sky is darkened with clouds,\r\nand mourning and lamentations are heard among us.\r\n\r\nJ. Warden: Our life is a vapor that appeareth for a little while, and\r\nthen vanisheth away. All flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as\r\nthe flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth\r\naway.\r\n\r\nMaster--It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the\r\nhouse of feasting; for that is the end of all men; and the living will\r\nlay it to his heart.\r\n\r\nResponse: So mote it be.\r\n\r\n\r\nOde--Air, Naomi.\r\n\r\n    Here Death his sacred seal hath set,\r\n      On bright and by-gone hours;\r\n    The dead we mourn are with us yet,\r\n      And--more than ever--ours!\r\n\r\n    Ours, by the pledge of love and faith;\r\n      By hopes of heaven on high;\r\n    By trust, triumphant over death,\r\n      In immortality.\r\n\r\n    The dead are like the stars by day,\r\n      Withdrawn from mortal eye;\r\n    Yet holding unperceived their way\r\n      Through the unclouded sky.\r\n\r\n    By them, through holy hope and love,\r\n      We feel, in hours serene,\r\n    Connected with the Lodge above,\r\n      Immortal and unseen.\r\n\r\nThe service may be concluded with the following, or some other suitable\r\nprayer:\r\n\r\nMost Glorious God, Author of all good and Giver of all mercy, pour down\r\nThy blessings upon us, and strengthen our solemn engagements with the\r\nties of sincere affection. May the present instance of mortality remind\r\nus of our own approaching fate, and, by drawing our attention toward\r\nThee, the only refuge in time of need, may we be induced to so regulate\r\nour conduct here that when the awful moment shall arrive at which we\r\nmust quit this transitory scene, the enlivening prospect of Thy mercy\r\nmay dispel the gloom of death, and that after our departure hence in\r\npeace and Thy favor, we may be received into Thine everlasting kingdom,\r\nand there join in union with our friends, and enjoy that uninterrupted\r\nand unceasing felicity which is allotted to the souls of just men made\r\nperfect. Amen.\r\n\r\nResponse: So mote it be.\r\n\r\nIf the remains of the deceased are to be removed to a distance, where\r\nthe brethren cannot follow to perform the ceremonies at the grave, the\r\nprocession will return to the Lodge room or disperse, as most\r\nconvenient.\r\n\r\n\r\nService at Grave.\r\n\r\nWhen the solemn rites of the dead are to be performed at the grave, the\r\nprocession should be formed, and proceed to the place of interment in\r\nthe following order:\r\n\r\n    Tiler, with drawn sword.\r\n\r\n    Masters of Ceremony, with white rods.\r\n\r\n    Musicians,\r\n    if they are Masons; otherwise they follow the Tiler.\r\n\r\n    Master Masons.\r\n\r\n    Secretary and Treasurer.\r\n\r\n    M     Senior and Junior Wardens.\r\n    A\r\n    R         Past Masters.\r\n    S\r\n    H         Chaplain.\r\n    A\r\n    L     The Three Great Lights\r\n          on a cushion, covered with black cloth, carried by\r\n          a member of the Lodge.\r\n\r\n    The Master,\r\n    Supported by two Deacons with white rods.\r\n\r\n    Officiating Clergy.\r\n\r\n    Pall Bearers.      Pall Bearers.\r\n               Mourners.\r\n\r\nIf the deceased was a member of a Royal Arch Chapter and a Commandery of\r\nKnights Templar, and members of those bodies should unite in the\r\nprocession, clothed as such, the former will follow the Past Masters,\r\nand the latter will act as an escort or guard of honor to the corpse,\r\noutside the pallbearers, marching in the form of a triangle, the\r\nofficers of the Commandery forming the base of the triangle, with the\r\nEminent Commander in the center.\r\n\r\nWhen the procession has arrived at the place of interment the members of\r\nthe Lodge should form a square around the grave; when the Master,\r\nChaplain and other officers of the acting Lodge, take their position at\r\nthe head of the grave, and the mourners at the foot.\r\n\r\nAfter the clergyman has performed the religious service of the Church,\r\nthe Masonic service should begin.\r\n\r\nThe Chaplain rehearses the following, or some other suitable prayer:\r\n\r\n\r\nPrayer.\r\n\r\nAlmighty and most merciful Father, we adore Thee as the God of time and\r\neternity. As it hath pleased Thee to take from the light of our abode\r\none dear to our hearts, we beseech Thee to bless and sanctify unto us\r\nthis dispensation of Thy providence. Inspire our hearts with wisdom from\r\non high, that we may glorify Thee in all our ways. May we realize that\r\nThine All-Seeing Eye is upon us, and be influenced by the spirit of\r\ntruth and love to perfect obedience--that we may enjoy Thy divine\r\napprobation here below. And when our toils on earth shall have ended,\r\nmay we be raised to the enjoyment of fadeless light and immortal life in\r\nthat kingdom where faith and hope shall end, and love and joy prevail\r\nthrough eternal ages. And Thine, O righteous Father, shall be the glory\r\nforever. Amen.\r\n\r\nResponse: So mote it be.\r\n\r\nThe following exhortation is then given by the Master:\r\n\r\nThe solemn notes that betoken the dissolution of this earthly tabernacle\r\nhave again alarmed our outer door, and another spirit has been summoned\r\nto the land where our fathers have gone before us.\r\n\r\nAgain we are called to assemble among the habitations of the dead, to\r\nbehold the \"narrow house appointed for all living.\" Here, around us, in\r\nthat peace which the world cannot give or take away, sleep the\r\nunnumbered dead. The gentle breeze fans their verdant covering, they\r\nheed it not; the sunshine and the storm pass over them, and they are not\r\ndisturbed; stones and lettered monuments symbolize the affection of\r\nsurviving friends, yet no sound proceeds from them, save that silent but\r\nthrilling admonition, \"Seek ye the narrow path and the straight gate\r\nthat lead unto eternal life.\"\r\n\r\nWe are again called upon to consider the uncertainty of human life, the\r\nimmutable certainty of death, and the vanity of all human pursuits.\r\nDecrepitude and decay are written upon every living thing. The cradle\r\nand the coffin stand in juxtaposition to each other; and it is a\r\nmelancholy truth that so soon as we begin to live, that moment we also\r\nbegin to die. It is passing strange that, notwithstanding the daily\r\nmementos of mortality that cross our path--notwithstanding the funeral\r\nbells so often toll in our ears and the \"mournful processions\" go about\r\nour streets--we will not more seriously consider our approaching fate.\r\nWe go on from design to design, add hope to hope, and lay out plans for\r\nthe employment of many years, until we are suddenly alarmed at the\r\napproach of the Messenger of Death, at a moment when we least expect\r\nhim, and which we probably conclude to be the meridian of our existence.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are all the externals of human dignity--the power of wealth,\r\nthe dreams of ambition, the pride of intellect, or the charms of\r\nbeauty--when Nature has paid her just debt? Fix your eyes on the last\r\nsad scene, and view life stripped of its ornaments, and exposed in its\r\nnatural weakness, and you must be persuaded of the utter emptiness of\r\nthese delusions. In the grave, all fallacies are detected, all ranks are\r\nleveled, all distinctions are done away. Here the scepter of the prince\r\nand the staff of the beggar are laid side by side.\r\n\r\nOur present meeting and proceedings will have been vain and useless, if\r\nthey fail to excite our serious reflections, and strengthen our\r\nresolutions of amendment.\r\n\r\nBe then persuaded, my brethren, by this example of the uncertainty of\r\nhuman life, of the unsubstantial nature of all its pursuits, and no\r\nlonger postpone the all-important concern of preparing for eternity. Let\r\nus each embrace the present moment, and while time and opportunity\r\npermit, prepare for that great change when the pleasures of the world be\r\nas a poison to our lips, and the happy reflections consequent upon a\r\nwell-spent life afford the only consolation.\r\n\r\nThus shall our hopes be not frustrated, nor we be hurried unprepared\r\ninto the presence of that all-wise and powerful Judge, to whom the\r\nsecrets of all hearts are known. Let us resolve to maintain with\r\nsincerity the dignified character of our profession. May our Faith be\r\nevinced in a correct moral walk and deportment; may our Hope be bright\r\nas the glorious mysteries that will be revealed hereafter; and our\r\nCharity boundless as the wants of our fellow-creatures. And, having\r\nfaithfully discharged the great duties which we owe to God, to our\r\nneighbor, and to ourselves, when at last it shall please the Grand\r\nMaster of the Universe to summon us into His eternal presence, may the\r\nTrestle-board of our whole lives pass such inspection that it may be\r\ngiven unto each of us to \"eat of the hidden manna,\" and to receive the\r\n\"white stone with a new name\" that will insure perpetual and unspeakable\r\nhappiness at His right hand.\r\n\r\nThe Lambskin being removed from the coffin, the Master holds it up and\r\nsays:\r\n\r\nW. M.: The Lambskin, or white leathern Apron, is an emblem of innocence\r\nand the badge of a Mason; more ancient than the Golden Fleece or Roman\r\nEagle; more honorable than Star and Garter, when worthily worn. This\r\nemblem I now deposit in the grave of our deceased brother. [Deposits\r\nit.] By it we are reminded of that purity of life and conduct so\r\nessentially necessary to gaining admission to the Celestial Lodge above,\r\nwhere the Supreme Architect of the Universe presides.\r\n\r\nThe mattock, the coffin, and the melancholy grave admonish us of our\r\nmortality, and that, sooner or later, these frail bodies must moulder in\r\ntheir parent dust.\r\n\r\nThe Master, holding the evergreen, continues:\r\n\r\nThis evergreen, which once marked the temporary resting-place of the\r\nillustrious dead, is an emblem of our faith in the immortality of the\r\nsoul. By it we are reminded that we have an immortal part within us,\r\nthat shall survive the grave, and which shall never, never, never die.\r\nBy it we are admonished that, though, like our brother whose remains lie\r\nbefore us, we shall soon be clothed in the habiliments of death, and\r\ndeposited in the silent tomb, yet, through our belief in the mercy of\r\nGod, we may confidently hope that our souls will bloom in eternal\r\nspring. This, too, I deposit in the grave.\r\n\r\nThe brethren then move in procession round the place of interment, and\r\nseverally drop the sprig of evergreen into the grave, during which the\r\nfollowing may be sung:\r\n\r\n\r\nFuneral Dirge.\r\n\r\n      Hark! from the tombs a doleful sound!\r\n        Mine ears attend the cry:\r\n      \"Ye living men, come view the ground\r\n        Where you must shortly lie.\r\n\r\n      \"Princes! this clay must be your bed,\r\n        In spite of all your towers;\r\n      The tall, the wise, the reverend head,\r\n        Must lie as low as ours.\"\r\n\r\n      Great God! Is this our certain doom?\r\n        And are we still secure?\r\n      Still walking downward to the tomb,\r\n        And yet prepared no more?\r\n\r\n      Grant us the power of quick'ning grace,\r\n        To fit our souls to fly;\r\n    Then, when we drop this dying flesh,\r\n      We'll rise above the sky.\r\n\r\nOr the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nPleyel's Hymn.\r\n\r\n      Solemn strikes the fun'ral chime,\r\n      Notes of our departing time;\r\n      As we journey here below\r\n      Through a pilgrimage of woe.\r\n\r\n      Mortals, now indulge a tear,\r\n      For mortality is here!\r\n      See how wide her trophies wave\r\n      O'er the slumbers of the grave!\r\n\r\n      Here another guest we bring!\r\n      Seraphs of celestial wing,\r\n    To our funeral altar come,\r\n      Waft our friend and brother home.\r\n\r\n      Lord of all! below--above--\r\n      Fill our hearts with truth and love;\r\n    When dissolves our earthly tie\r\n      Take us to Thy Lodge on high.\r\n\r\nAfter which the Masonic funeral honors are given.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Honors, practiced among Masons at funerals, whether in public\r\nor private, are given in the following manner: Both arms are crossed on\r\nthe breast, the left uppermost, and the open palms of the hands sharply\r\nstriking the shoulders; they are then raised above the head, the palms\r\nstriking each other, and then made to fall smartly upon the thighs. This\r\nis repeated three times, and while they are being given the third time,\r\nthe brethren audibly pronounce the following words--when the arms are\r\ncrossed on the breast: \"We cherish his memory here;\" when the hands are\r\nextended above the head: \"We commend his spirit to God who gave it;\" and\r\nwhen the hands are extended toward the ground: \"And consign his body to\r\nthe grave.\"\r\n\r\nThe Master then continues the ceremony:\r\n\r\nThe Great Creator, having been pleased to remove our brother from the\r\ncares and troubles of this transitory existence to a state of endless\r\nduration, thus severing another link from the fraternal chain that binds\r\nus together, may we who survive him be more strongly cemented in the\r\nties of union and friendship; and, during the short space allotted us\r\nhere, we may wisely and usefully employ our time, and, in the reciprocal\r\nintercourse of kind and friendly acts, mutually promote the welfare and\r\nhappiness of each other.\r\n\r\nUnto the grave we now consign his body--earth to earth; ashes to ashes;\r\ndust to dust--there to remain until the trump shall sound on the\r\nResurrection morn. We can trustfully leave him in the hands of Him who\r\ndoeth all things well, who is \"glorious in holiness, fearful in praises,\r\ndoing wonders.\"\r\n\r\nTo those of his immediate relatives and friends who are most\r\nheart-stricken at the loss we have all sustained, we have but little of\r\nthis world's consolation to offer; we can only sincerely, deeply and\r\nmost affectionately sympathize with them in their afflictive\r\nbereavement; but we can say, that He who tempers the wind to the shorn\r\nlamb looks down with infinite compassion upon the widow and fatherless\r\nin the hour of their desolation; and that the Great Architect will fold\r\nthe arms of His love and protection around those who put their trust in\r\nHim.\r\n\r\nThen let us improve this solemn warning, so that, when the sheeted dead\r\nare stirring, when the great white throne is set, we shall receive from\r\nthe Omniscient Judge the thrilling invitation, \"Come, ye blessed,\r\ninherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.\"\r\n\r\nThe services will close with the following or some other suitable\r\nprayer:\r\n\r\n\r\nPrayer.\r\n\r\nMost Glorious God, Author of all good and Giver of all mercy, pour down\r\nThy blessings upon us, and strengthen our solemn engagements with the\r\nties of sincere affection. May the present instance of mortality remind\r\nus of our own approaching fate, and, by drawing our attention toward\r\nThee, the only refuge in time of need, may we be induced to so regulate\r\nour conduct here that when the awful moment shall arrive at which we\r\nmust quit this transitory scene, the enlivening prospect of Thy mercy\r\nmay dispel the gloom of death, and that after our departure hence in\r\npeace and Thy favor, we may be received into Thine everlasting kingdom,\r\nand there enjoy that uninterrupted and unceasing felicity which is\r\nallotted to the souls of just men made perfect. \"Bless those who are\r\nbereaved by this sad providence, and make this brotherhood faithful to\r\ntheir solemn vows, to comfort, aid, and protect those thus left to their\r\nsacred charge.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now, O Lord, we pray for Thy hand to lead us in all the paths our\r\nfeet must tread; and when the journey of life is ended, may light from\r\nour immortal home illuminate the dark valley and shadow of death, and\r\nvoices of the loved ones welcome us to that \"house not made with hands,\r\neternal in the heavens.\" Amen.\r\n\r\nResponse: So mote it be.\r\n\r\nThe Master then approaches the head of the grave (or the entrance to the\r\ntomb), and gently says:\r\n\r\nSoft and safe to thee, my brother, be this earthly bed. Bright and\r\nglorious be thy rising from it. Fragrant be the acacia sprig that here\r\nshall flourish. May the earliest buds of spring unfold their beauties on\r\nthis, thy resting place; and here may the sweetness of the summer's rose\r\nlinger latest. Though the cold blast of autumn may lay them in the dust,\r\nand for a time destroy the loveliness of their existence, yet the\r\ndestruction is not final, and in the springtime they shall surely bloom\r\nagain. So, in the bright morning of the world's resurrection, thy mortal\r\nframe, now laid in the dust by the chilling blast of death, shall spring\r\nagain into newness of life, and expand, in immortal beauty, in realms\r\nbeyond the skies. Until then, dear brother, until then, farewell.\r\n\r\nThe Benediction will then be pronounced by the Master, or Chaplain, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe Lord bless us and keep us. The Lord make His face to shine upon us\r\nand be gracious unto us. The Lord lift up the light of His countenance,\r\nand give us peace. Amen.\r\n\r\nResponse: So mote it be.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Service at Grave.\r\n\r\nIn very inclement weather service at the grave can be shortened by\r\nomitting any part of the ceremony except the apron, acacia and honors.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER SERVICE AT THE GRAVE.\r\n\r\nAt the grave the Lodge forms a circle or semicircle. The Master and\r\nother officers of the Lodge take their position at the head of the\r\ngrave; the Tyler behind the Master, and the mourners at the foot. The\r\nreligious burial service of the church (if there be any) should be first\r\nperformed, after which the Masonic service begins:\r\n\r\nThe following passage of Scripture, from Ecclesiastes, chapter xii,\r\nverses 1-7, is read:\r\n\r\nChaplain: Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the\r\nevil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have\r\nno pleasure in them; while the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the\r\nstars be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain; in the day\r\nwhen the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall\r\nbow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those\r\nthat look out of the windows be darkened; and the doors shall be shut in\r\nthe streets, when the sound of the grinding is low; and he shall rise up\r\nat the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of music shall be\r\nbrought low; also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and\r\nfears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the\r\ngrasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail; because man goeth\r\nto his long home, and the mourners go about the streets; or ever the\r\nsilver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be\r\nbroken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern. Then shall\r\nthe dust return to the earth as it was, and the spirit shall return unto\r\nGod who gave it.\r\n\r\nMaster: One by one they pass away--the brothers of our adoption, the\r\ncompanions of our choice. A brother whose hand we have clasped in the\r\nbonds of fraternal fellowship now lies before us in the rigid embrace of\r\ndeath. All that remains of one near and dear to us is passing from our\r\nsight, and we know that we shall meet him on earth no more.\r\n\r\nWe, who knew him so well in our brotherhood, feel that in his departure\r\nfrom among the living, something has gone out of our own lives that can\r\nnever be again. Thus, as human ties are broken, the world becomes less\r\nand less, and the hope to be reunited with friends who are gone, grows\r\nmore and more. Here is immediate compensation, which, while it cannot\r\nassuage our grief, may teach resignation to the inevitable doom of all\r\nthings mortal.\r\n\r\nWhile we stand around the open grave, in the presence of a body once,\r\nand so lately, warm with life and animate with thought, now lingering\r\nfor a brief moment at the dark portal of the tomb--like a beam of holy\r\nlight the belief must come, this cannot be all there is of day. Stricken\r\nhuman nature cries out: There must be a dawn beyond this darkness and a\r\nnever setting sun, while this short life is but a morning star.\r\n\r\nThe cycles of Time roll with the procession of seasons. Spring is bloom;\r\nsummer is growth; autumn is fruition; winter is the shroud, and beneath\r\nits cold, yet kindly fold, live the germs of a new life. Spring comes\r\nagain; growth matures, and fruit is eternal. This is the religion and\r\nlesson of Nature, and the universal example cannot fail in relation to\r\nman. Let us draw comfort and consolation from things visible in this sad\r\nscene, and lift our eyes to the invisible Father of all with renewed\r\nfaith that we are in His Holy Hands. Besides His infinitude of worlds,\r\nwe have also His word, \"That He is All, and All-upholding.\"\r\n\r\nWe can do nothing for the dead. We can only offer respect to our\r\nbrother's inanimate clay, and cherish his memory in the abiding faith\r\nthat our temporary loss is his eternal gain. In this belief let us\r\ncommit him with due reverence to the keeping of the All-Father, who is\r\nsupreme in wisdom, infinite in love, and ordereth all things well.\r\n\r\n(Family service to be omitted in case no relatives of the deceased are\r\npresent.)\r\n\r\nWhile we pay this tribute of respect and love to the memory of our late\r\nbrother, let us not forget to extend our fraternal sympathy to his\r\ndeeply afflicted and sorrowing family (wife, children, father, mother,\r\nbrothers, sisters, as the relatives may be present): In your irreparable\r\nbereavement, and as he, for whom we are all mourners, was true to us,\r\nand faithful to the ties of our brotherhood, so shall we be true to you\r\nin the practice of the principles of Freemasonry and in tender memory of\r\nour loved and lost. He gave much of his time to us in devotion to our\r\ncause. We owe a grateful acknowledgement to you for his social\r\ncompanionship and service, and mingle our sorrows at parting with\r\nyours, his near and dear relations.\r\n\r\nMaster: \"May we be true and faithful; and may we live and die in love!\"\r\n\r\nResponse: \"So mote it be.\"\r\n\r\nMaster: \"May we profess what is good, and always act agreeably to our\r\nprofession!\"\r\n\r\nResponse: \"So mote it be.\"\r\n\r\nMaster: \"May the Lord bless us and prosper us, and may all our good\r\nintentions be crowned with success.\"\r\n\r\nResponse: \"So mote it be.\"\r\n\r\nThe apron is taken from the coffin and handed to the Master; and while\r\nthe coffin is being lowered into the grave, either of the following\r\nfuneral dirges may be sung--the one used, to be selected and announced\r\nbefore leaving the lodge-room:\r\n\r\n\r\nFuneral Dirge.\r\n\r\nAir--Pleyel's Hymn.\r\n\r\n    Solemn strikes the funeral chime,\r\n    Notes of our departing time,\r\n    As we journey here below\r\n    Through a pilgrimage of woe.\r\n\r\n    Mortals, now indulge a tear,\r\n    For Mortality is here;\r\n    See how wide her trophies wave,\r\n    O'er the slumber of the grave!\r\n\r\n    Here another guest we bring;\r\n    Seraphs of celestial wing,\r\n    To our funeral altar come,\r\n    Waft our friend and brother home.\r\n\r\n    Lord of all! below--above--\r\n    Fill our hearts with truth and love;\r\n    When dissolves our earthly tie,\r\n    Take us to Thy lodge on high.\r\n\r\n\r\nHark, From the Tombs.\r\n\r\n    Hark, from the tombs, a doleful sound,\r\n      Mine ears attend the cry:\r\n    \"Ye living men; come view the ground\r\n      Where you must shortly lie.\r\n\r\n    \"Princes, this clay must be your bed,\r\n      In spite of all your towers;\r\n    The tall, the wise, the reverend head\r\n      Must lie as low as ours.\"\r\n\r\n    Great God! Is this our certain doom?\r\n      And are we still secure?\r\n    Still walking downward to the tomb,\r\n      And yet prepared no more?\r\n\r\n    Grant us the power of quick'ning grace,\r\n      To fit our souls to fly;\r\n    Then, when we drop this dying flesh,\r\n      We'll rise above the sky.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the singing, the Master, displaying the apron,\r\ncontinues:\r\n\r\nThe Lambskin, or white leathern apron, is an emblem of innocence, and\r\nthe badge of a Mason; more honorable than the crown of royalty, or the\r\nemblazoned insignia of princely orders, when worthily worn.\r\n\r\nThe Master drops the apron into the grave.\r\n\r\nOur brother was worthy of its distinction, and it shall bear witness to\r\nhis virtues, and our confidence in the sincerity of his profession.\r\n\r\nW. M.: (Taking off his white glove and holding it up.) This Glove is a\r\nsymbol of fidelity and is emblematic of that Masonic friendship which\r\nbound us to him whose tenement of clay now lies before us. It reminds us\r\nthat while these mortal eyes shall see him not again, yet, by the\r\npractice of the tenets of our noble order and a firm faith and steadfast\r\ntrust in the Supreme Architect, we hope to clasp once more his vanished\r\nhand in friendship and in love. (Deposits glove.) Those whom virtue\r\nunites, death can never separate.\r\n\r\nThe Master, displaying an evergreen sprig, continues:\r\n\r\nThe Evergreen is emblematic of our Faith in Immortality.\r\n\r\nThis green sprig is the symbol of that vital spark of our being which\r\ncontinues to glow more divinely when the breath leaves the body, and can\r\nnever, never, never die.\r\n\r\nThe Master drops the evergreen in the grave, and the Brothers each make\r\na similar deposit, with as little confusion as possible.\r\n\r\nIf the place is convenient, they march around the grave in a line. When\r\nall are again settled in their places, the public Grand Honors are given\r\nby three times three.\r\n\r\nThe will of God is accomplished; so mote it be. Amen.\r\n\r\nThe Master then continues:\r\n\r\nChange is the universal law of mortality, and the theme of every page of\r\nits history. Here we view the most striking illustration of change that\r\ncan be presented to mortal eyes, minds and hearts. Ties of fraternity,\r\nfriendship, love, all broken, and earthly pursuits, hopes and affections\r\nlaid waste by death. Let us profit by this example of the uncertainty of\r\nthe world, and resolve to live honest, pure and worshipful lives in\r\ndaily preparation for the summons that will, sooner or later, surely\r\ncome. It came to our brother, whose remains we have here laid away to\r\nrest eternal, and reminds us that we, too, are mortal--subject to the\r\nuniversal law. Our brother is dead, and cannot speak for himself. Let us\r\ndefend his good name. Frailties he may have had, as what mortal man has\r\nnot? To err is human, charity is Divine, and judgment is with the\r\nAlmighty and All-Merciful. In this resting place of the body, virtues\r\nonly are remembered, and sweet memories bloom.\r\n\r\nAll must pass through the Shadow of Death, and each one must make the\r\ndark journey without the companionship of earthly friend. Let us all\r\nhasten to secure the passport of an upright life, to the glories of a\r\nbetter land. Unto the grave we have resigned the body of our brother.\r\n\r\nThe Master scatters a handful of earth in the grave.\r\n\r\nEarth to earth; dust to dust (the S. W. scatters dirt in the grave);\r\nashes to ashes (the J. W. scatters dirt in the grave); there to remain\r\nuntil the dawn of that resplendent day, when again, the morning stars\r\nshall sing together, and all the sons of God shall shout for joy.\r\n\r\nPrayer by the Chaplain.\r\n\r\nChaplain: Almighty and eternal God, in whom we live and move, and have\r\nour being--and before whom all men must appear, in the judgment day to\r\ngive an account of their deeds in life, we, who are daily exposed to the\r\nflying shafts of death, and now surround the grave of our fallen\r\nbrother, most earnestly beseech Thee to impress deeply on our minds the\r\nsolemnities of this day, as well as the lamentable occurrence that has\r\noccasioned them. Here may we be forcibly reminded that in the midst of\r\nlife we are in death, and that whatever elevation of character we may\r\nhave obtained, however upright and square the course we have pursued,\r\nyet shortly we must all submit as victims of its destroying power, and\r\nendure the humbling level of the tomb, until the last loud trump shall\r\nsound the summons of our resurrection from mortality and corruption.\r\n\r\nMay we have Thy divine assistance, O merciful God, to redeem our\r\nmis-spent time; and in the discharge of our important duties Thou has\r\nassigned us, in the erection of our moral edifice, may we have wisdom\r\nfrom on high to direct us, strength commensurate with our task to\r\nsupport us, and the beauty of holiness to adorn and render all our\r\nperformances acceptable in Thy sight. And when our work is done, and our\r\nbodies mingle with the mother earth, may our souls, disengaged from\r\ntheir cumbrous dust, flourish and bloom in eternal day; and enjoy that\r\nrest which Thou hast prepared for all good and faithful servants, in\r\nthat spiritual house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens,\r\nthrough the great Redeemer. Amen.\r\n\r\nSo mote it be. Amen.\r\n\r\nFill grave.\r\n\r\nW. M.: Soft and safe, my brother, be this thy earthly bed. Bright and\r\nglorious be thy rising from it. In the glorious morning of the\r\nresurrection may thy body spring again into newness of life, to live\r\nforever in the home of the blest. Until then, dear brother, farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\nBenediction.\r\n\r\nChaplain: The Lord bless us and keep us. The Lord make his face to shine\r\nupon us and be gracious unto us. The Lord lift up the light of his\r\ncountenance and give us peace. Amen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRITUAL FOR A LODGE OF SORROW.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following Ritual for a Lodge of Sorrow is recommended for use in the\r\nLodges. While necessarily of a funeral character, it differs essentially\r\nfrom the burial service. In the latter case, we are in the actual\r\npresence of the departed, and engaged in the last rites of affection and\r\nrespect for one who has been our companion in life, and whose mortal\r\nremains we are about to consign to their last resting-place. The Lodge\r\nof Sorrow, on the contrary, is intended to celebrate the memory of our\r\ndeparted brethren; and while we thus recall to our recollection their\r\nvirtues, and temper anew our resolutions so to live, that, when we shall\r\nhave passed the silent portals, our memories may be cherished with\r\ngrateful remembrance, we learn to look upon death from a more elevated\r\npoint of view; to see in it the wise and necessary transition from the\r\ntrials and imperfections of this world, to the perfect life for which\r\nour transient journey here has been the school and the preparation.\r\nVocal and instrumental music are indispensable to the proper effect of\r\nthe ceremony. The brethren should wear dark clothing, and white gloves\r\nand aprons. There is no necessity for any attempt at secrecy in the\r\nceremonies of Sorrow Lodges. They may be held in churches or public\r\nhalls, or in the presence of friends at the Lodge room, with benefit to\r\nall concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreparation of the Hall.\r\n\r\nI. The Lodge room should be appropriately draped in black, and the\r\nseveral stations covered with the same emblem of mourning.\r\n\r\nII. On the Master's pedestal is a skull and lighted taper.\r\n\r\nIII. In the center of the room is placed the catafalque, which consists\r\nof a rectangular platform, about six feet long by four feet wide, on\r\nwhich are two smaller platforms, so that three steps are represented. On\r\nthe third one should be an elevation of convenient height, on which is\r\nplaced an urn. The platform should be draped in black, and a canopy of\r\nblack drapery may be raised over the urn and platform.\r\n\r\nIV. At each corner of the platform will be placed a candlestick, bearing\r\na lighted taper, and near it, facing the East, will be seated a brother,\r\nprovided with an extinguisher, to be used at the proper time.\r\n\r\nV. During the first part of the ceremonies the lights in the room should\r\nburn dimly.\r\n\r\nVI. Arrangements should be made to enable the light to be increased to\r\nbrilliancy at the appropriate point in the ceremony.\r\n\r\nVII. On the catafalque will be laid a pair of white gloves, a lambskin\r\napron, and if the deceased brother had been an officer, the appropriate\r\ninsignia of his office.\r\n\r\nVIII. Where the Lodge is held in memory of several brethren, shields\r\nbearing their names are placed around the catafalque.\r\n\r\n\r\nOpening the Lodge.\r\n\r\nThe several officers being in their places, and the brethren seated, the\r\nWorshipful Master will call up the Lodge and say:\r\n\r\nW. M.: Brother Senior Warden, for what purpose are we assembled?\r\n\r\nS. W.: To honor the memory of those brethren whom death hath taken from\r\nus; to contemplate our own approaching dissolution; and, by the\r\nremembrance of immortality, to raise our souls above the considerations\r\nof this transitory existence.\r\n\r\nW. M.: Brother Junior Warden, what sentiments should inspire the souls\r\nof Masons on occasions like the present?\r\n\r\nJ. W.: Calm sorrow for the absence of our brethren who have gone before\r\nus; earnest solicitude for our own eternal welfare, and a firm faith and\r\nreliance upon the wisdom and goodness of the Great Architect of the\r\nUniverse.\r\n\r\nW. M.: Brethren, commending these sentiments to your earnest\r\nconsideration, and invoking your assistance in the solemn ceremonies\r\nabout to take place, I declare this Lodge of Sorrow opened.\r\n\r\nThe Chaplain, or Worshipful Master, will then offer the following, or\r\nsome other suitable\r\n\r\n\r\nPrayer:\r\n\r\nGrand Architect of the Universe, in whose holy sight centuries are but\r\nas days; to whose omniscience the past and the future are but as one\r\neternal present; look down upon Thy children, who still wander among the\r\ndelusions of time--who still tremble with dread of dissolution, and\r\nshudder at the mysteries of the future; look down, we beseech Thee,\r\nfrom Thy glorious and eternal day into the dark night of our error and\r\npresumption, and suffer a ray of Thy divine light to penetrate into our\r\nhearts, that in them may awaken and bloom the certainty of life,\r\nreliance upon Thy promises, and assurance of a place at Thy right hand.\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nResponse: So mote it be!\r\n\r\nThe following, or some other appropriate Ode may here be sung:\r\n\r\n\r\nOde.\r\n\r\nTune--Bradford, C. M.\r\n\r\n    O brother, thou art gone to rest;\r\n      We will not weep for thee;\r\n    For thou art nowhere, oft on earth,\r\n      Thy spirit longed to be.\r\n\r\n    O brother, thou art gone to rest;\r\n      Thy toils and cares are o'er;\r\n    And sorrow, pain, and suffering now\r\n      Shall ne'er distress thee more.\r\n\r\n    O brother, thou art gone to rest,\r\n      And this shall be our prayer:\r\n    That, when we reach our journey's end,\r\n      Thy glory we shall share.\r\n\r\nThe Worshipful Master (taking the skull in his hand) will then say:\r\n\r\nBrethren: In the midst of life we are in death, and the wisest cannot\r\nknow what a day may bring forth. We live but to see those we love\r\npassing away into the silent land.\r\n\r\nBehold this emblem of mortality, once the abode of a spirit like our\r\nown; beneath this mouldering canopy once shone the bright and busy eye;\r\nwithin this hollow cavern once played the ready, swift, and tuneful\r\ntongue; and now, sightless and mute, it is eloquent only in the lessons\r\nit teaches us.\r\n\r\nThink of those brethren, who, but a few days since, were among us in all\r\nthe pride and power of life; bring to your minds the remembrance of\r\ntheir wisdom, their strength, and their beauty; and then reflect that\r\n\"to this complexion have they come at last;\" think of yourselves, thus\r\nwill you be when the lamp of your brief existence has burned out. Think\r\nhow soon death, for you, will be a reality. Man's life is like a flower,\r\nwhich blooms today, and tomorrow is faded, cast aside, and trodden under\r\nfoot. The most of us, my brethren, are fast approaching, or have already\r\npassed the meridian of life; our sun is setting in the West; and oh! how\r\nmuch more swift is the passage of our declining years than when we\r\nstarted upon the journey, and believed--as the young are too apt to\r\nbelieve--that the roseate hues of the rising sun of our existence were\r\nalways to be continued. When we look back upon the happy days of our\r\nchildhood, when the dawning intellect first began to exercise its powers\r\nof thought, it seems as but yesterday, and that, by a simple effort of\r\nthe will, we could put aside our manhood, and seek again the loving\r\ncaresses of a mother, or be happy in the possession of a bauble; and\r\ncould we now realize the idea that our last hour had come, our whole\r\nearthly life would seem but as the space of time from yesterday until\r\ntoday. Centuries upon centuries have rolled away behind us; before us\r\nstretches out an eternity of years to come; and on the narrow boundary\r\nbetween the past and the present flickers the puny taper we term our\r\nlife. When we came into the world, we knew naught of what had been\r\nbefore us; but, as we grew up to manhood, we learned of the past; we saw\r\nthe flowers bloom as they had bloomed for centuries; we beheld the orbs\r\nof day and night pursuing their endless course among the stars, as they\r\nhad pursued it from the birth of light; we learned what men had thought,\r\nand said, and done, from the beginning of the world to our day; but only\r\nthrough the eye of faith can we behold what is to come hereafter, and\r\nonly through a firm reliance upon the Divine promises can we satisfy the\r\nyearnings of an immortal soul. The cradle speaks to us of\r\nremembrance--the coffin, of hope, of a blessed trust in a never-ending\r\nexistence beyond the gloomy portals of the tomb.\r\n\r\nLet these reflections convince us how vain are all the wranglings and\r\nbitterness engendered by the collisions of the world; how little in\r\ndignity above the puny wranglings of ants over a morsel of food, or for\r\nthe possession of a square inch of soil.\r\n\r\nWhat shall survive us? Not, let us hope, the petty strifes and\r\nbickerings, the jealousies and heart-burnings, the small triumphs and\r\nmean advantages we have gained, but rather the noble thoughts, the words\r\nof truth, the works of mercy and justice, that ennoble and light up the\r\nexistence of every honest man, however humble, and live for good when\r\nhis body, like this remnant of mortality, is mouldering in its parent\r\ndust.\r\n\r\nLet the proud and the vain consider how soon the gaps are filled that\r\nare made in society by those who die around them; and how soon time\r\nheals the wounds that death inflicts upon the loving heart; and from\r\nthis let them learn humility, and that they are but drops in the great\r\nocean of humanity.\r\n\r\nAnd when God sends his angel to us with the scroll of death, let us look\r\nupon it as an act of mercy, to prevent many sins and many calamities of\r\na longer life; and lay down our heads softly and go to sleep, without\r\nwrangling like froward children. For this at least man gets by death,\r\nthat his calamities are not immortal. To bear grief honorably and\r\ntemperately, and to die willingly and nobly, are the duties of a good\r\nman and true Mason.\r\n\r\n\r\nOde.\r\n\r\nTune--Naomi. C. M.\r\n\r\n    When those we love are snatched away,\r\n      By Death's relentless hand,\r\n    Our hearts the mournful tribute pay,\r\n      That friendship must demand.\r\n\r\n    While pity prompts the rising sigh,\r\n      With awful power imprest;\r\n    May this dread truth, \"I too must die,\"\r\n      Sink deep in every breast.\r\n\r\n    Let this vain world allure no more;\r\n      Behold the opening tomb!\r\n    It bids us use the present hour;\r\n      Tomorrow death may come.\r\n\r\n    The voice of this instructive scene\r\n      May every heart obey;\r\n    Nor be the faithful warning vain\r\n      Which calls to watch and pray.\r\n\r\nAt its conclusion the Chaplain will read the following passages:\r\n\r\nLo, He goeth by me and I see Him not. He passeth on also, but I perceive\r\nHim not. Behold He taketh away, who can hinder Him?\r\n\r\nMan that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. He\r\ncometh forth like a flower, and is cut down; he fleeth also as a shadow,\r\nand continueth not. Seeing his days are determined, the number of his\r\nmonths are with Thee: Thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot\r\npass; turn from him that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an\r\nhireling, his day. For there is hope of a tree if it be cut down, that\r\nit will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.\r\nThough the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die\r\nin the ground, yet through the scent of water it will bud and bring\r\nforth boughs like a plant. But man dieth and wasteth away; yea, man\r\ngiveth up the ghost, and where is he? As the waters fail from the sea,\r\nand the flood decayeth and drieth up, so man lieth down, and riseth not;\r\ntill the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of\r\ntheir sleep.\r\n\r\nMy days are passed, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my\r\nheart. If I wait, the grave is mine house; I have made my bed in the\r\ndarkness. I have said to corruption, thou art my father. And where is\r\nnow my hope? As for my hope, who shall see it? They shall go down to the\r\nbars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.\r\n\r\nMy bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh. Oh, that my words were now\r\nwritten; Oh, that they were printed in a book! That they were graven\r\nwith an iron pen and lead in the rock forever! For I know that my\r\nRedeemer liveth, and that He shall stand at the latter day upon the\r\nearth. And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh\r\nshall I see God. Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall\r\nbehold, and not another.\r\n\r\nFor Thou cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and Thy floods\r\ncompassed me about; all Thy billows and Thy waves passed over me. Then I\r\nsaid, I am cast out of Thy sight; yet will I look again toward Thy holy\r\ntemple. The waters compassed me about, even to the soul, the depth\r\nclosed me round about, the weeds were wrapt about my head.\r\n\r\nI said, in the cutting off of my days I shall go to the gates of the\r\ngrave! I am deprived of the residue of my years; I said, I shall not see\r\nthe Lord, even the Lord in the land of the living; I shall behold man no\r\nmore with the inhabitants of the world. Behold, for peace I had great\r\nbitterness; but Thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit\r\nof corruption. For the grave cannot praise Thee, death cannot celebrate\r\nThee; the living, the living, he shall praise Thee as I do this day.\r\n\r\nAre not my days few? Cease, then, and let me alone, that I may take\r\ncomfort a little, before I go whence I shall not return, even to the\r\nland of darkness, and the shadow of death. A land of darkness, as\r\ndarkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and\r\nwhere the light is as darkness.\r\n\r\nAn interval of profound silence will be observed. The general lights of\r\nthe hall, if there be convenience, will be turned low, and the four\r\nbrethren will extinguish the tapers near which they are placed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrayer by the Chaplain.\r\n\r\nOur Father Who art in heaven, it hath pleased Thee to take from among us\r\nthose who were our brethren. Let time, as it heals the wounds thus\r\ninflicted upon our hearts and on the hearts of those who were near and\r\ndear to them, not erase the salutary lessons engraved there; but let\r\nthose lessons, always continuing distinct and legible, make us and them\r\nwiser and better. And whatever distress or trouble may hereafter come\r\nupon us, may we ever be consoled by the reflection that Thy wisdom and\r\nThy love are equally infinite, and that our sorrows are not the\r\nvisitations of Thy wrath, but the result of the great law of harmony by\r\nwhich everything is being conducted to a good and perfect issue in the\r\nfullness of Thy time. Let the loss of our brethren increase our\r\naffection for those who are yet spared to us, and make us more punctual\r\nin the performance of the duties that friendship, love and honor demand.\r\nWhen it comes to us also to die, may a firm and abiding trust in Thy\r\nmercy dispel the gloom and dread of dissolution. Be with us now, and\r\nsanctify the solemnities of this occasion to our hearts, that we may\r\nserve Thee in spirit and understanding. And to Thy name shall be\r\nascribed the praise forever. Amen.\r\n\r\nResponse: So mote it be!\r\n\r\nThe Wardens, Deacons and Stewards, will now approach the East and form a\r\nprocession, thus:\r\n\r\n    Two Stewards, with rods.\r\n\r\n    Two Wardens.\r\n\r\n    The Worshipful Master, supported by the Deacons, with rods.\r\n\r\nThis procession will move once around the catafalque to slow and solemn\r\nmusic. On arriving at the East, the procession will halt and open to the\r\nright and left. The Junior Warden will then advance to the catafalque,\r\nand, placing upon it a bunch of white flowers, will say:\r\n\r\nJunior Warden: In memory of our departed brethren I deposit these white\r\nflowers, emblematical of that pure life to which they have been called,\r\nand reminding us that as these children of an hour will droop and fade\r\naway, so, too, shall we soon follow those who have gone before us, and\r\ninciting us so to fill the brief span of our existence that we may leave\r\nto our survivors a sweet savor of remembrance.\r\n\r\nThe Junior Warden will now return to his place, and an interval of\r\nprofound silence will be observed. The procession will again be formed,\r\nand move as before, to the sound of slow music, twice around the\r\ncatafalque. They will open as before, and the Senior Warden approaching\r\nthe catafalque will place upon it a wreath of white flowers, and say:\r\n\r\nSenior Warden: As the sun sets in the West, to close the day and herald\r\nthe approach of night, so, one by one we lay us down in the darkness of\r\nthe tomb to wait in its calm repose for the time when the heavens shall\r\npass away as a scroll, and man, standing in the presence of the\r\nInfinite, shall realize the true end of his pilgrimage here below. Let\r\nthese flowers be to us the symbol of remembrance of all the virtues of\r\nour brethren who have preceded us to the silent land, the token of that\r\nfraternal alliance which binds us while on earth and which we hope will\r\nfinally unite us in heaven.\r\n\r\nThe Senior Warden returns to his place, and an interval of profound\r\nsilence will be observed. The procession will again be formed, and move\r\nthree times around the catafalque to slow and solemn music, as before.\r\nArrived in the East, the Worshipful Master will advance and place upon\r\nthe Urn a wreath of evergreen, and say:\r\n\r\nWorshipful Master: It is appointed unto all men once to die, and after\r\ndeath cometh the resurrection. The dust shall return to the earth and\r\nthe spirit unto God who gave it. In the grave all men are equal; the\r\ngood deeds, the lofty thoughts, the heroic sacrifices alone survive and\r\nbear fruit in the lives of those who strive to emulate them.\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, nature will have its way, and our tears will fall upon\r\nthe graves of our brethren, let us be reminded by the evergreen symbol\r\nof our faith in immortal life that the dead are but sleeping, and be\r\ncomforted by the reflection that their memories will not be forgotten;\r\nthat they will still be loved by those who are soon to follow them; that\r\nin our archives their names are written, and that in our hearts there is\r\nstill a place for them. And so, trusting in the infinite love and tender\r\nmercy of Him without whose knowledge not even a sparrow falls, let us\r\nprepare to meet them where there is no parting, and where with them we\r\nshall enjoy eternal rest.\r\n\r\nThe Worshipful Master will return to his place, and a period of silence\r\nwill obtain. The Chaplain will now be conducted to the altar, where he\r\nwill read:\r\n\r\nBut some man will say: How are the dead raised up? and with what body do\r\nthey come? Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened except it\r\ndie; and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall\r\nbe, but bear grain; it may chance of wheat or of some other grain; but\r\nGod giveth it a body as it hath pleased Him, and to every seed his own\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nAll flesh is not the same flesh; but there is one kind of flesh of men,\r\nanother flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds. There\r\nare also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial; but the glory of the\r\ncelestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.\r\n\r\nThere is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and\r\nanother glory of the stars; for one star differeth from another star in\r\nglory. So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in\r\ncorruption, it is raised in incorruption; it is sown in dishonor, it is\r\nraised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; it is\r\nsown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural\r\nbody, and there is a spiritual body. And so it is written, the first man\r\nAdam was made a living soul, the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.\r\nHowbeit, that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is\r\nnatural; and afterward that which is spiritual. The first man is of the\r\nearth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthy,\r\nsuch are they also that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are\r\nthey also that are heavenly. And as we have borne the image of the\r\nearthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.\r\n\r\nNow this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the\r\nkingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. Behold, I\r\nshow you a mystery; we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed;\r\nin a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump; for the\r\ntrumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we\r\nshall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and\r\nthis mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have\r\nput on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then\r\nshall be brought to pass the saying that is written, death is swallowed\r\nup in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy\r\nvictory?\r\n\r\nAs the Chaplain pronounces the concluding words, \"O grave, where is thy\r\nvictory?\" the lights in the hall will be raised to brilliancy, the four\r\nbrethren seated around the catafalque will relight the tapers, while a\r\nstrain of triumphant music will be played.\r\n\r\nThe Chaplain will return to his place in the East, and the following, or\r\nsome other appropriate Ode, will be sung to music of a more cheerful\r\ncharacter:\r\n\r\n\r\nOde.--Tune, Cary.\r\n\r\n    One sweetly solemn thought\r\n      Comes to me o'er and o'er;\r\n    I am nearer home today\r\n      Than I ever have been before.\r\n\r\n    Nearer my Father's house,\r\n      Where the many mansions be;\r\n    Nearer the great white throne;\r\n      Nearer the crystal sea.\r\n\r\n    Nearer the bound of life,\r\n      Where we lay our burdens down;\r\n    Nearer leaving the cross;\r\n      Nearer gaining the crown.\r\n\r\n    But lying darkly between,\r\n      Winding down through the night,\r\n    Is the deep and unknown stream,\r\n      That leads at last to the light.\r\n\r\n    Father, perfect my trust!\r\n      Strengthen the might of my faith;\r\n    Let me feel as I would when I stand\r\n      On the rock of the shore of death.\r\n\r\n    Feel as I would when my feet\r\n      Are slipping over the brink;\r\n    For it may be, I am nearer home--\r\n      Nearer now than I think.\r\n\r\nThe Orator will then pronounce the Eulogium.\r\n\r\nThen follows the following, or some other appropriate Ode:\r\n\r\n\r\nOde.--Tune: Old Hundred. L. M.\r\n\r\n    Once more, O Lord, let grateful praise\r\n      From ev'ry heart to Thee ascend;\r\n    Thou art the guardian of our days,\r\n      Our first, our best and changeless friend.\r\n\r\n    Hear now our parting hymn of praise,\r\n      And bind our hearts in love divine;\r\n    Oh, may we walk in wisdom's ways,\r\n      And ever feel that we are Thine.\r\n\r\n\r\nClosing.\r\n\r\nWorshipful Master: Brother Senior Warden, our recollection of our\r\ndeparted friends has been refreshed, and we may now ask ourselves, were\r\nthey just and perfect Masons, worthy men, unwearied toilers in the\r\nvineyard, and possessed of so many virtues as to overcome their faults\r\nand shortcomings? Answer these questions, as Masons should answer.\r\n\r\nSenior Warden: Man judgeth not of man. He Whose infinite and tender\r\nmercy passeth all comprehension, Whose goodness endureth forever, has\r\ncalled our brethren hence. Let Him judge.\r\n\r\nIn ancient Egypt no one could gain admittance to the sacred asylum of\r\nthe tomb until he had passed under the most solemn judgment before a\r\ngrave tribunal.\r\n\r\nPrinces and peasants came there to be judged, escorted only by their\r\nvirtues and their vices. A public accuser recounted the history of their\r\nlives, and threw the penetrating light of truth on all their actions. If\r\nit were adjudged that the dead man had led an evil life, his memory was\r\ncondemned in the presence of the nation, and his body was denied the\r\nhonors of sepulture. But Masonry has no such tribunal to sit in judgment\r\nupon her dead; with her, the good that her sons have done lives after\r\nthem; and the evil is interred with their bones. She does require,\r\nhowever, that whatever is said concerning them shall be the truth; and\r\nshould it ever happen that of a Mason, who dies, nothing good can be\r\ntruthfully said, she will mournfully and pityingly bury him out of her\r\nsight in silence.\r\n\r\nWorshipful Master: Brethren, let us profit by the admonitions of this\r\nsolemn occasion, lay to heart the truths to which we have listened, and\r\nresolve so to walk that when we lay us down to the last sleep it may be\r\nthe privilege of the brethren to strew white flowers upon our graves and\r\nkeep our memories as a pleasant remembrance.\r\n\r\nBrother Senior Warden: Announce to the brethren that our labors are now\r\nconcluded, and that it is my pleasure that this Lodge of Sorrow be\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\nSenior Warden: Brother Junior Warden, the labors of this Lodge of Sorrow\r\nbeing ended, it is the pleasure of the Worshipful Master that it be now\r\nclosed. Make due announcement to the brethren, and invite them to\r\nassist.\r\n\r\nJunior Warden [calling up the Lodge]. Brethren, the labors of this Lodge\r\nof Sorrow being ended, it is the pleasure of the Worshipful Master that\r\nit be now closed.\r\n\r\nW. M.: Let us unite with our Chaplain in an invocation to the Throne of\r\nGrace.\r\n\r\n    *    *    *\r\n\r\nW.
