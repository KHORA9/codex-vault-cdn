It enjoys immense popularity and authority in India, where it is\r\nreckoned as one of the ``Five Jewels,\"--pancharatnani--of Devanagiri\r\nliterature. In plain but noble language it unfolds a philosophical system\r\nwhich remains to this day the prevailing Brahmanic belief, blending as it\r\ndoes the doctrines of Kapila, Patanjali, and the Vedas. So lofty are many\r\nof its declarations, so sublime its aspirations, so pure and tender its\r\npiety, that Schlegel, after his study of the poem, breaks forth into this\r\noutburst of delight and praise towards its unknown author:\r\n\"Magistrorum reverentia a Brachmanis inter sanctissima pietatis officia\r\nrefertur. Ergo te primum, Vates sanctissime, Numinisque hypopheta!\r\nquisquis tandem inter mortales dictus tu fueris, carminis bujus auctor,,\r\ncujus oraculis mens ad excelsa quaeque,quaeque,, aeterna atque divina,\r\ncum inenarraoih quddam delectatione rapitur-te primum, inquam,\r\nsalvere jubeo, et vestigia tua semper adore.\" Lassen re-echoes this\r\nsplendid tribute; and indeed, so striking are some of the moralities here\r\ninculcated, and so close the parallelism--ofttimes actually verbal--\r\nbetween its teachings and those of the New Testament, that a\r\ncontroversy has arisen between Pandits and Missionaries on the point\r\nwhether the author borrowed from Christian sources, or the Evangelists\r\nand Apostles from him.\r\n\r\nThis raises the question of its date, which cannot be positively settled. It\r\nmust have been inlaid into the ancient epic at a period later than that of\r\nthe original Mahabharata, but Mr Kasinath Telang has offered some fair\r\narguments to prove it anterior to the Christian era. The weight of\r\nevidence, however, tends to place its composition at about the third\r\ncentury after Christ; and perhaps there are really echoes in this\r\nBrahmanic poem of the lessons of Galilee, and of the Syrian incarnation.\r\n\r\nIts scene is the level country between the Jumna and the Sarsooti\r\nrivers-now Kurnul and Jheend. Its simple plot consists of a dialogue held\r\nby Prince Arjuna, the brother of King Yudhisthira, with Krishna, the\r\nSupreme Deity, wearing the disguise of a charioteer. A great battle is\r\nimpending between the armies of the Kauravas and Pandavas, and this\r\nconversation is maintained in a war-chariot drawn up between the\r\nopposing hosts.\r\n\r\nThe poem has been turned into French by Burnouf, into Latin by Lassen,\r\ninto Italian by Stanislav Gatti, into Greek by Galanos, and into English\r\nby Mr. Thomson and Mr Davies, the prose transcript of the last-named\r\nbeing truly beyond praise for its fidelity and clearness. Mr Telang has\r\nalso published at Bombay a version in colloquial rhythm, eminently\r\nlearned and intelligent, but not conveying the dignity or grace of the\r\noriginal. If I venture to offer a translation of the wonderful poem after\r\nso many superior scholars, it is in grateful recognition of the help\r\nderived from their labours, and because English literature would\r\ncertainly be incomplete without possessing in popular form a poetical\r\nand philosophical work so dear to India.\r\n\r\nThere is little else to say which the \"Song Celestial\" does not explain for\r\nitself. The Sanskrit original is written in the Anushtubh metre, which\r\ncannot be successfully reproduced for Western ears. I have therefore\r\ncast it into our flexible blank verse, changing into lyrical measures\r\nwhere the text itself similarly breaks. For the most part, I believe the\r\nsense to be faithfully preserved in the following pages; but Schlegel\r\nhimself had to say: \"In reconditioribus me semper poetafoster mentem\r\nrecte divinasse affirmare non ausim.\" Those who would read more upon\r\nthe philosophy of the poem may find an admirable introduction in the\r\nvolume of Mr Davies, printed by Messrs Trubner & Co.\r\n\r\nEDWIN ARNOLD, C.S.I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n     I.

Therein stand ranked\r\n  Chiefs like Arjuna, like to Bhima chiefs,\r\n  Benders of bows; Virata, Yuyudhan,\r\n  Drupada, eminent upon his car,\r\n  Dhrishtaket, Chekitan, Kasi's stout lord,\r\n  Purujit, Kuntibhoj, and Saivya,\r\n  With Yudhamanyu, and Uttamauj\r\n  Subhadra's child; and Drupadi's;-all famed!\r\n  All mounted on their shining chariots!\r\n  On our side, too,--thou best of Brahmans! see\r\n  Excellent chiefs, commanders of my line,\r\n  Whose names I joy to count: thyself the first,\r\n  Then Bhishma, Karna, Kripa fierce in fight,\r\n  Vikarna, Aswatthaman; next to these\r\n  Strong Saumadatti, with full many more\r\n  Valiant and tried, ready this day to die\r\n  For me their king, each with his weapon grasped,\r\n  Each skilful in the field. Weakest-meseems-\r\n  Our battle shows where Bhishma holds command,\r\n  And Bhima, fronting him, something too strong!\r\n  Have care our captains nigh to Bhishma's ranks\r\n  Prepare what help they may! Now, blow my shell!\"\r\n\r\n  Then, at the signal of the aged king,\r\n  With blare to wake the blood, rolling around\r\n  Like to a lion's roar, the trumpeter\r\n  Blew the great Conch; and, at the noise of it,\r\n  Trumpets and drums, cymbals and gongs and horns\r\n  Burst into sudden clamour; as the blasts\r\n  Of loosened tempest, such the tumult seemed!\r\n  Then might be seen, upon their car of gold\r\n  Yoked with white steeds, blowing their battle-shells,\r\n  Krishna the God, Arjuna at his side:\r\n  Krishna, with knotted locks, blew his great conch\r\n  Carved of the \"Giant's bone;\" Arjuna blew\r\n  Indra's loud gift; Bhima the terrible--\r\n  Wolf-bellied Bhima-blew a long reed-conch;\r\n  And Yudhisthira, Kunti's blameless son,\r\n  Winded a mighty shell, \"Victory's Voice;\"\r\n  And Nakula blew shrill upon his conch\r\n  Named the \"Sweet-sounding,\" Sahadev on his\r\n  Called\"Gem-bedecked,\" and Kasi's Prince on his.\r\n  Sikhandi on his car, Dhrishtadyumn,\r\n  Virata, Satyaki the Unsubdued,\r\n  Drupada, with his sons, (O Lord of Earth!)\r\n  Long-armed Subhadra's children, all blew loud,\r\n  So that the clangour shook their foemen's hearts,\r\n  With quaking earth and thundering heav'n.\r\n\r\n  Then 'twas-\r\n  Beholding Dhritirashtra's battle set,\r\n  Weapons unsheathing, bows drawn forth, the war\r\n  Instant to break-Arjun, whose ensign-badge\r\n  Was Hanuman the monkey, spake this thing\r\n  To Krishna the Divine, his charioteer:\r\n  \"Drive, Dauntless One! to yonder open ground\r\n  Betwixt the armies; I would see more nigh\r\n  These who will fight with us, those we must slay\r\n  To-day, in war's arbitrament; for, sure,\r\n  On bloodshed all are bent who throng this plain,\r\n  Obeying Dhritirashtra's sinful son.\"\r\n\r\n  Thus, by Arjuna prayed, (O Bharata!)\r\n  Between the hosts that heavenly Charioteer\r\n  Drove the bright car, reining its milk-white steeds\r\n  Where Bhishma led,and Drona,and their Lords.\r\n  \"See!\" spake he to Arjuna, \"where they stand,\r\n  Thy kindred of the Kurus:\" and the Prince\r\n  Marked on each hand the kinsmen of his house,\r\n  Grandsires and sires, uncles and brothers and sons,\r\n  Cousins and sons-in-law and nephews, mixed\r\n  With friends and honoured elders; some this side,\r\n  Some that side ranged: and, seeing those opposed,\r\n  Such kith grown enemies-Arjuna's heart\r\n  Melted with pity, while he uttered this:\r\n\r\n  Arjuna.\r\n  Krishna! as I behold, come here to shed\r\n  Their common blood, yon concourse of our kin,\r\n  My members fail, my tongue dries in my mouth,\r\n  A shudder thrills my body, and my hair\r\n  Bristles with horror; from my weak hand slips\r\n  Gandiv, the goodly bow; a fever burns\r\n  My skin to parching; hardly may I stand;\r\n  The life within me seems to swim and faint;\r\n  Nothing do I foresee save woe and wail!\r\n  It is not good, O Keshav! nought of good\r\n  Can spring from mutual slaughter! Lo, I hate\r\n  Triumph and domination, wealth and ease,\r\n  Thus sadly won! Aho! what victory\r\n  Can bring delight, Govinda! what rich spoils\r\n  Could profit; what rule recompense; what span\r\n  Of life itself seem sweet, bought with such blood?\r\n  Seeing that these stand here, ready to die,\r\n  For whose sake life was fair, and pleasure pleased,\r\n  And power grew precious:-grandsires, sires, and sons,\r\n  Brothers, and fathers-in-law, and sons-in-law,\r\n  Elders and friends! Shall I deal death on these\r\n  Even though they seek to slay us? Not one blow,\r\n  O Madhusudan! will I strike to gain\r\n\r\n  The rule of all Three Worlds; then, how much less\r\n  To seize an earthly kingdom! Killing these\r\n  Must breed but anguish, Krishna! If they be\r\n  Guilty, we shall grow guilty by their deaths;\r\n  Their sins will light on us, if we shall slay\r\n  Those sons of Dhritirashtra, and our kin;\r\n  What peace could come of that, O Madhava?\r\n  For if indeed, blinded by lust and wrath,\r\n  These cannot see, or will not see, the sin\r\n  Of kingly lines o'erthrown and kinsmen slain,\r\n  How should not we, who see, shun such a crime--\r\n  We who perceive the guilt and feel the shame--\r\n  O thou Delight of Men, Janardana?\r\n  By overthrow of houses perisheth\r\n  Their sweet continuous household piety,\r\n  And-rites neglected, piety extinct--\r\n  Enters impiety upon that home;\r\n  Its women grow unwomaned, whence there spring\r\n  Mad passions, and the mingling-up of castes,\r\n  Sending a Hell-ward road that family,\r\n  And whoso wrought its doom by wicked wrath.\r\n  Nay, and the souls of honoured ancestors\r\n  Fall from their place of peace, being bereft\r\n  Of funeral-cakes and the wan death-water.[FN#1]\r\n  So teach our holy hymns. Thus, if we slay\r\n  Kinsfolk and friends for love of earthly power,\r\n  Ahovat! what an evil fault it were!\r\n  Better I deem it, if my kinsmen strike,\r\n  To face them weaponless, and bare my breast\r\n  To shaft and spear, than answer blow with blow.\r\n\r\n  So speaking, in the face of those two hosts,\r\n  Arjuna sank upon his chariot-seat,\r\n  And let fall bow and arrows, sick at heart.\r\n\r\n  HERE ENDETH CHAPTER I. OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA,\r\n  Entitled \"Arjun-Vishad,\"\r\n  Or \"The Book of the Distress of Arjuna.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sanjaya.\r\n  Him, filled with such compassion and such grief,\r\n  With eyes tear-dimmed, despondent, in stern words\r\n  The Driver, Madhusudan, thus addressed:\r\n\r\n  Krishna.\r\n  How hath this weakness taken thee? Whence springs\r\n  The inglorious trouble, shameful to the brave,\r\n  Barring the path of virtue? Nay, Arjun!\r\n  Forbid thyself to feebleness! it mars\r\n  Thy warrior-name! cast off the coward-fit!\r\n  Wake! Be thyself! Arise, Scourge of thy Foes!\r\n\r\n  Arjuna.\r\n  How can I, in the battle, shoot with shafts\r\n  On Bhishma, or on Drona-O thou Chief!--\r\n  Both worshipful, both honourable men?\r\n\r\n  Better to live on beggar's bread\r\n    With those we love alive,\r\n  Than taste their blood in rich feasts spread,\r\n    And guiltily survive!\r\n  Ah! were it worse-who knows?--to be\r\n    Victor or vanquished here,\r\n  When those confront us angrily\r\n    Whose death leaves living drear?\r\n  In pity lost, by doubtings tossed,\r\n    My thoughts-distracted-turn\r\n  To Thee, the Guide I reverence most,\r\n    That I may counsel learn:\r\n  I know not what would heal the grief\r\n    Burned into soul and sense,\r\n  If I were earth's unchallenged chief--\r\n    A god--and these gone thence!\r\n\r\n  Sanjaya.\r\n  So spake Arjuna to the Lord of  Hearts,\r\n  And sighing,\"I will not fight!\" held silence then.\r\n  To whom, with tender smile, (O Bharata! )\r\n  While the Prince wept despairing 'twixt those hosts,\r\n  Krishna made answer in divinest verse:\r\n\r\n  Krishna.\r\n  Thou grievest where no grief should be! thou speak'st\r\n  Words lacking wisdom! for the wise in heart\r\n  Mourn not for those that live, nor those that die.\r\n  Nor I, nor thou, nor any one of these,\r\n  Ever was not, nor ever will not be,\r\n  For ever and for ever afterwards.\r\n  All, that doth live, lives always! To man's frame\r\n  As there come infancy and youth and age,\r\n  So come there raisings-up and layings-down\r\n  Of other and of other life-abodes,\r\n  Which the wise know, and fear not. This that irks--\r\n  Thy sense-life, thrilling to the elements--\r\n  Bringing thee heat and cold, sorrows and joys,\r\n  'Tis brief and mutable! Bear with it, Prince!\r\n  As the wise bear. The soul which is not moved,\r\n  The soul that with a strong and constant calm\r\n  Takes sorrow and takes joy indifferently,\r\n  Lives in the life undying! That which is\r\n  Can never cease to be; that which is not\r\n  Will not exist. To see this truth of both\r\n  Is theirs who part essence from accident,\r\n  Substance from shadow. Indestructible,\r\n  Learn thou! the Life is, spreading life through all;\r\n  It cannot anywhere, by any means,\r\n  Be anywise diminished, stayed, or changed.\r\n  But for these fleeting frames which it informs\r\n  With spirit deathless, endless, infinite,\r\n  They perish. Let them perish, Prince! and fight!\r\n  He who shall say, \"Lo! I have slain a man!\"\r\n  He who shall think, \"Lo! I am slain!\" those both\r\n  Know naught! Life cannot slay. Life is not slain!\r\n  Never the spirit was born; the spirit shall cease to be never;\r\n  Never was time it was not; End and Beginning are dreams!\r\n  Birthless and deathless and changeless remaineth the spirit for ever;\r\n  Death hath not touched it at all, dead though the house of it seems!\r\n\r\n  Who knoweth it exhaustless, self-sustained,\r\n  Immortal, indestructible,--shall such\r\n  Say, \"I have killed a man, or caused to kill?\"\r\n\r\n  Nay, but as when one layeth\r\n    His worn-out robes away,\r\n  And taking new ones, sayeth,\r\n    \"These will I wear to-day!\"\r\n  So putteth by the spirit\r\n    Lightly its garb of flesh,\r\n  And passeth to inherit\r\n    A residence afresh.\r\n\r\n  I say to thee weapons reach not the Life;\r\n  Flame burns it not, waters cannot o'erwhelm,\r\n  Nor dry winds wither it. Impenetrable,\r\n  Unentered, unassailed, unharmed, untouched,\r\n  Immortal, all-arriving, stable, sure,\r\n  Invisible, ineffable, by word\r\n  And thought uncompassed, ever all itself,\r\n  Thus is the Soul declared! How wilt thou, then,--\r\n  Knowing it so,--grieve when thou shouldst not grieve?\r\n  How, if thou hearest that the man new-dead\r\n  Is, like the man new-born, still living man--\r\n  One same, existent Spirit--wilt thou weep?\r\n  The end of birth is death; the end of death\r\n  Is birth: this is ordained! and mournest thou,\r\n  Chief of the stalwart arm! for what befalls\r\n  Which could not otherwise befall? The birth\r\n  Of living things comes unperceived; the death\r\n  Comes unperceived; between them, beings perceive:\r\n  What is there sorrowful herein, dear Prince?\r\n\r\n  Wonderful, wistful, to contemplate!\r\n    Difficult, doubtful, to speak upon!\r\n  Strange and great for tongue to relate,\r\n    Mystical hearing for every one!\r\n  Nor wotteth man this, what a marvel it is,\r\n    When seeing, and saying, and hearing are done!\r\n\r\n  This Life within all living things, my Prince!\r\n  Hides beyond harm; scorn thou to suffer, then,\r\n  For that which cannot suffer. Do thy part!\r\n  Be mindful of thy name, and tremble not!\r\n  Nought better can betide a martial soul\r\n  Than lawful war; happy the warrior\r\n  To whom comes joy of battle--comes, as now,\r\n  Glorious and fair, unsought; opening for him\r\n  A gateway unto Heav'n. But, if thou shunn'st\r\n  This honourable field--a Kshattriya--\r\n  If, knowing thy duty and thy task, thou bidd'st\r\n  Duty and task go by--that shall be sin!\r\n  And those to come shall speak thee infamy\r\n  From age to age; but infamy is worse\r\n  For men of noble blood to bear than death!\r\n  The chiefs upon their battle-chariots\r\n  Will deem 'twas fear that drove thee from the fray.\r\n  Of those who held thee mighty-souled the scorn\r\n  Thou must abide, while all thine enemies\r\n  Will scatter bitter speech of thee, to mock\r\n  The valour which thou hadst; what fate could fall\r\n  More grievously than this? Either--being killed--\r\n  Thou wilt win Swarga's safety, or--alive\r\n  And victor--thou wilt reign an earthly king.\r\n  Therefore, arise, thou Son of Kunti! brace\r\n  Thine arm for conflict, nerve thy heart to meet--\r\n  As things alike to thee--pleasure or pain,\r\n  Profit or ruin, victory or defeat:\r\n  So minded, gird thee to the fight, for so\r\n  Thou shalt not sin!\r\n\r\n  Thus far I speak to thee\r\n  As from the \"Sankhya\"--unspiritually--\r\n  Hear now the deeper teaching of the Yog,\r\n  Which holding, understanding, thou shalt burst\r\n  Thy Karmabandh, the bondage of wrought deeds.\r\n  Here shall no end be hindered, no hope marred,\r\n  No loss be feared: faith--yea, a little faith--\r\n  Shall save thee from the anguish of thy dread.\r\n  Here, Glory of the Kurus! shines one rule--\r\n  One steadfast rule--while shifting souls have laws\r\n  Many and hard. Specious, but wrongful deem\r\n  The speech of those ill-taught ones who extol\r\n  The letter of their Vedas, saying, \"This\r\n  Is all we have, or need;\" being weak at heart\r\n  With wants, seekers of Heaven: which comes--they say--\r\n  As \"fruit of good deeds done;\" promising men\r\n  Much profit in new births for works of faith;\r\n  In various rites abounding; following whereon\r\n  Large merit shall accrue towards wealth and power;\r\n  Albeit, who wealth and power do most desire\r\n  Least fixity of soul have such, least hold\r\n  On heavenly meditation. Much these teach,\r\n  From Veds, concerning the \"three qualities;\"\r\n  But thou, be free of the \"three qualities,\"\r\n  Free of the \"pairs of opposites,\"[FN#2] and free\r\n  From that sad righteousness which calculates;\r\n  Self-ruled, Arjuna! simple, satisfied![FN#3]\r\n  Look! like as when a tank pours water forth\r\n  To suit all needs, so do these Brahmans draw\r\n  Text for all wants from tank of Holy Writ.\r\n  But thou, want not! ask not! Find full reward\r\n  Of doing right in right! Let right deeds be\r\n  Thy motive, not the fruit which comes from them.\r\n  And live in action! Labour! Make thine acts\r\n  Thy piety, casting all self aside,\r\n  Contemning gain and merit; equable\r\n  In good or evil: equability\r\n  Is Yog, is piety!\r\n\r\n  Yet, the right act\r\n  Is less, far less, than the right-thinking mind.\r\n  Seek refuge in thy soul; have there thy heaven!\r\n  Scorn them that follow virtue for her gifts!\r\n  The mind of pure devotion--even here--\r\n  Casts equally aside good deeds and bad,\r\n  Passing above them. Unto pure devotion\r\n  Devote thyself: with perfect meditation\r\n  Comes perfect act, and the right-hearted rise--\r\n  More certainly because they seek no gain--\r\n  Forth from the bands of body, step by step,\r\n  To highest seats of bliss. When thy firm soul\r\n  Hath shaken off those tangled oracles\r\n  Which ignorantly guide, then shall it soar\r\n  To high neglect of what's denied or said,\r\n  This way or that way, in doctrinal writ.\r\n  Troubled no longer by the priestly lore,\r\n  Safe shall it live, and sure; steadfastly bent\r\n  On meditation. This is Yog--and Peace!\r\n\r\n  Arjuna.\r\n  What is his mark who hath that steadfast heart,\r\n  Confirmed in holy meditation? How\r\n  Know we his speech, Kesava? Sits he, moves he\r\n  Like other men?\r\n\r\n  Krishna.\r\n  When one, O Pritha's Son!\r\n  Abandoning desires which shake the mind--\r\n  Finds in his soul full comfort for his soul,\r\n  He hath attained the Yog--that man is such!\r\n  In sorrows not dejected, and in joys\r\n  Not overjoyed; dwelling outside the stress\r\n  Of passion, fear, and anger; fixed in calms\r\n  Of lofty contemplation;--such an one\r\n  Is Muni, is the Sage, the true Recluse!\r\n  He who to none and nowhere overbound\r\n  By ties of flesh, takes evil things and good\r\n  Neither desponding nor exulting, such\r\n  Bears wisdom's plainest mark! He who shall draw\r\n  As the wise tortoise draws its four feet safe\r\n  Under its shield, his five frail senses back\r\n  Under the spirit's buckler from the world\r\n  Which else assails them, such an one, my Prince!\r\n  Hath wisdom's mark! Things that solicit sense\r\n  Hold off from the self-governed; nay, it comes,\r\n  The appetites of him who lives beyond\r\n  Depart,--aroused no more. Yet may it chance,\r\n  O Son of Kunti! that a governed mind\r\n  Shall some time feel the sense-storms sweep, and wrest\r\n  Strong self-control by the roots. Let him regain\r\n  His kingdom! let him conquer this, and sit\r\n  On Me intent. That man alone is wise\r\n  Who keeps the mastery of himself! If one\r\n  Ponders on objects of the sense, there springs\r\n  Attraction; from attraction grows desire,\r\n  Desire flames to fierce passion, passion breeds\r\n  Recklessness; then the memory--all betrayed--\r\n  Lets noble purpose go, and saps the mind,\r\n  Till purpose, mind, and man are all undone.\r\n  But, if one deals with objects of the sense\r\n  Not loving and not hating, making them\r\n  Serve his free soul, which rests serenely lord,\r\n  Lo! such a man comes to tranquillity;\r\n  And out of that tranquillity shall rise\r\n  The end and healing of his earthly pains,\r\n  Since the will governed sets the soul at peace.\r\n  The soul of the ungoverned is not his,\r\n  Nor hath he knowledge of himself; which lacked,\r\n  How grows serenity? and, wanting that,\r\n  Whence shall he hope for happiness?\r\n\r\n  The mind\r\n  That gives itself to follow shows of sense\r\n  Seeth its helm of wisdom rent away,\r\n  And, like a ship in waves of whirlwind, drives\r\n  To wreck and death. Only with him, great Prince!\r\n  Whose senses are not swayed by things of sense--\r\n  Only with him who holds his mastery,\r\n  Shows wisdom perfect. What is midnight-gloom\r\n  To unenlightened souls shines wakeful day\r\n  To his clear gaze; what seems as wakeful day\r\n  Is known for night, thick night of ignorance,\r\n  To his true-seeing eyes. Such is the Saint!\r\n\r\n  And like the ocean, day by day receiving\r\n      Floods from all lands, which never overflows\r\n  Its boundary-line not leaping, and not leaving,\r\n      Fed by the rivers, but unswelled by those;--\r\n\r\n  So is the perfect one! to his soul's ocean\r\n      The world of sense pours streams of witchery;\r\n  They leave him as they find, without commotion,\r\n      Taking their tribute, but remaining sea.\r\n\r\n  Yea! whoso, shaking off the yoke of flesh\r\n  Lives lord, not servant, of his lusts; set free\r\n  From pride, from passion, from the sin of \"Self,\"\r\n  Toucheth tranquillity! O Pritha's Son!\r\n  That is the state of Brahm! There rests no dread\r\n  When that last step is reached! Live where he will,\r\n  Die when he may, such passeth from all 'plaining,\r\n  To blest Nirvana, with the Gods, attaining.\r\n\r\n  HERE ENDETH CHAPTER II. OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA,\r\n  Entitled \"Sankhya-Yog,\"\r\n  Or \"The Book of Doctrines.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\n  Arjuna.\r\n  Thou whom all mortals praise, Janardana!\r\n  If meditation be a nobler thing\r\n  Than action, wherefore, then, great Kesava!\r\n  Dost thou impel me to this dreadful fight?\r\n  Now am I by thy doubtful speech disturbed!\r\n  Tell me one thing, and tell me certainly;\r\n  By what road shall I find the better end?\r\n\r\n  Krishna.\r\n  I told thee, blameless Lord! there be two paths\r\n  Shown to this world; two schools of wisdom.\r\n\r\n  First\r\n  The Sankhya's, which doth save in way of works\r\n  Prescribed[FN#4] by reason; next, the Yog, which bids\r\n  Attain by meditation, spiritually:\r\n  Yet these are one! No man shall 'scape from act\r\n  By shunning action; nay, and none shall come\r\n  By mere renouncements unto perfectness.\r\n  Nay, and no jot of time, at any time,\r\n  Rests any actionless; his nature's law\r\n  Compels him, even unwilling, into act;\r\n  [For thought is act in fancy]. He who sits\r\n  Suppressing all the instruments of flesh,\r\n  Yet in his idle heart thinking on them,\r\n  Plays the inept and guilty hypocrite:\r\n  But he who, with strong body serving mind,\r\n  Gives up his mortal powers to worthy work,\r\n  Not seeking gain, Arjuna! such an one\r\n  Is honourable. Do thine allotted task!\r\n  Work is more excellent than idleness;\r\n  The body's life proceeds not, lacking work.\r\n  There is a task of holiness to do,\r\n  Unlike world-binding toil, which bindeth not\r\n  The faithful soul; such earthly duty do\r\n  Free from desire, and thou shalt well perform\r\n  Thy heavenly purpose. Spake Prajapati--\r\n  In the beginning, when all men were made,\r\n  And, with mankind, the sacrifice-- \"Do this!\r\n  Work! sacrifice! Increase and multiply\r\n  With sacrifice! This shall be Kamaduk,\r\n  Your 'Cow of Plenty,' giving back her milk\r\n  Of all abundance. Worship the gods thereby;\r\n  The gods shall yield thee grace. Those meats ye crave\r\n  The gods will grant to Labour, when it pays\r\n  Tithes in the altar-flame. But if one eats\r\n  Fruits of the earth, rendering to kindly Heaven\r\n  No gift of toil, that thief steals from his world.\"\r\n\r\n  Who eat of food after their sacrifice\r\n  Are quit of fault, but they that spread a feast\r\n  All for themselves, eat sin and drink of sin.\r\n  By food the living live; food comes of rain,\r\n  And rain comes by the pious sacrifice,\r\n  And sacrifice is paid with tithes of toil;\r\n  Thus action is of Brahma, who is One,\r\n  The Only, All-pervading; at all times\r\n  Present in sacrifice. He that abstains\r\n  To help the rolling wheels of this great world,\r\n  Glutting his idle sense, lives a lost life,\r\n  Shameful and vain. Existing for himself,\r\n  Self-concentrated, serving self alone,\r\n  No part hath he in aught; nothing achieved,\r\n  Nought wrought or unwrought toucheth him; no hope\r\n  Of help for all the living things of earth\r\n  Depends from him.[FN#5] Therefore, thy task prescribed\r\n  With spirit unattached gladly perform,\r\n  Since in performance of plain duty man\r\n  Mounts to his highest bliss. By works alone\r\n  Janak and ancient saints reached blessedness!\r\n  Moreover, for the upholding of thy kind,\r\n  Action thou should'st embrace. What the wise choose\r\n  The unwise people take; what best men do\r\n  The multitude will follow. Look on me,\r\n  Thou Son of Pritha! in the three wide worlds\r\n  I am not bound to any toil, no height\r\n  Awaits to scale, no gift remains to gain,\r\n  Yet I act here! and, if I acted not--\r\n  Earnest and watchful--those that look to me\r\n  For guidance, sinking back to sloth again\r\n  Because I slumbered, would decline from good,\r\n  And I should break earth's order and commit\r\n  Her offspring unto ruin, Bharata!\r\n  Even as the unknowing toil, wedded to sense,\r\n  So let the enlightened toil, sense-freed, but set\r\n  To bring the world deliverance, and its bliss;\r\n  Not sowing in those simple, busy hearts\r\n  Seed of despair. Yea! let each play his part\r\n  In all he finds to do, with unyoked soul.\r\n  All things are everywhere by Nature wrought\r\n  In interaction of the qualities.\r\n  The fool, cheated by self, thinks, \"This I did\"\r\n  And \"That I wrought; \"but--ah, thou strong-armed Prince!--\r\n  A better-lessoned mind, knowing the play\r\n  Of visible things within the world of sense,\r\n  And how the qualities must qualify,\r\n  Standeth aloof even from his acts. Th' untaught\r\n  Live mixed with them, knowing not Nature's way,\r\n  Of highest aims unwitting, slow and dull.\r\n  Those make thou not to stumble, having the light;\r\n  But all thy dues discharging, for My sake,\r\n  With meditation centred inwardly,\r\n  Seeking no profit, satisfied, serene,\r\n  Heedless of issue--fight! They who shall keep\r\n  My ordinance thus, the wise and willing hearts,\r\n  Have quittance from all issue of their acts;\r\n  But those who disregard My ordinance,\r\n  Thinking they know, know nought, and fall to loss,\r\n  Confused and foolish. 'Sooth, the instructed one\r\n  Doth of his kind, following what fits him most:\r\n  And lower creatures of their kind; in vain\r\n  Contending 'gainst the law. Needs must it be\r\n  The objects of the sense will stir the sense\r\n  To like and dislike, yet th' enlightened man\r\n  Yields not to these, knowing them enemies.\r\n  Finally, this is better, that one do\r\n  His own task as he may, even though he fail,\r\n  Than take tasks not his own, though they seem good.\r\n  To die performing duty is no ill;\r\n  But who seeks other roads shall wander still.\r\n\r\n  Arjuna.\r\n  Yet tell me, Teacher! by what force doth man\r\n  Go to his ill, unwilling; as if one\r\n  Pushed him that evil path?\r\n\r\n  Krishna.\r\n  Kama it is!\r\n  Passion it is! born of the Darknesses,\r\n  Which pusheth him. Mighty of appetite,\r\n  Sinful, and strong is this!--man's enemy!\r\n  As smoke blots the white fire, as clinging rust\r\n  Mars the bright mirror, as the womb surrounds\r\n  The babe unborn, so is the world of things\r\n  Foiled, soiled, enclosed in this desire of flesh.\r\n  The wise fall, caught in it; the unresting foe\r\n  It is of wisdom, wearing countless forms,\r\n  Fair but deceitful, subtle as a flame.\r\n  Sense, mind, and reason--these, O Kunti's Son!\r\n  Are booty for it; in its play with these\r\n  It maddens man, beguiling, blinding him.\r\n  Therefore, thou noblest child of Bharata!\r\n  Govern thy heart! Constrain th' entangled sense!\r\n  Resist the false, soft sinfulness which saps\r\n  Knowledge and judgment! Yea, the world is strong,\r\n  But what discerns it stronger, and the mind\r\n  Strongest; and high o'er all the ruling Soul.\r\n  Wherefore, perceiving Him who reigns supreme,\r\n  Put forth full force of Soul in thy own soul!\r\n  Fight! vanquish foes and doubts, dear Hero! slay\r\n  What haunts thee in fond shapes, and would betray!\r\n\r\n  HERE ENDETH CHAPTER III. OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA,\r\n  Entitled \"Karma-Yog,\"\r\n  Or \"The Book of Virtue in Work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\n  Krishna.\r\n  This deathless Yoga, this deep union,\r\n  I taught Vivaswata,[FN#6] the Lord of Light;\r\n  Vivaswata to Manu gave it; he\r\n  To Ikshwaku; so passed it down the line\r\n  Of all my royal Rishis. Then, with years,\r\n  The truth grew dim and perished, noble Prince!\r\n  Now once again to thee it is declared--\r\n  This ancient lore, this mystery supreme--\r\n  Seeing I find thee votary and friend.\r\n\r\n  Arjuna.\r\n  Thy birth, dear Lord, was in these later days,\r\n  And bright Vivaswata's preceded time!\r\n  How shall I comprehend this thing thou sayest,\r\n  \"From the beginning it was I who taught?\"\r\n\r\n  Krishna.\r\n  Manifold the renewals of my birth\r\n  Have been, Arjuna! and of thy births, too!\r\n  But mine I know, and thine thou knowest not,\r\n  O Slayer of thy Foes! Albeit I be\r\n  Unborn, undying, indestructible,\r\n  The Lord of all things living; not the less--\r\n  By Maya, by my magic which I stamp\r\n  On floating Nature-forms, the primal vast--\r\n  I come, and go, and come. When Righteousness\r\n  Declines, O Bharata! when Wickedness\r\n  Is strong, I rise, from age to age, and take\r\n  Visible shape, and move a man with men,\r\n  Succouring the good, thrusting the evil back,\r\n  And setting Virtue on her seat again.\r\n  Who knows the truth touching my births on earth\r\n  And my divine work, when he quits the flesh\r\n  Puts on its load no more, falls no more down\r\n  To earthly birth: to Me he comes, dear Prince!\r\n  Many there be who come! from fear set free,\r\n  From anger, from desire; keeping their hearts\r\n  Fixed upon me--my Faithful--purified\r\n  By sacred flame of Knowledge. Such as these\r\n  Mix with my being. Whoso worship me,\r\n  Them I exalt; but all men everywhere\r\n  Shall fall into my path; albeit, those souls\r\n  Which seek reward for works, make sacrifice\r\n  Now, to the lower gods. I say to thee\r\n  Here have they their reward. But I am He\r\n  Made the Four Castes, and portioned them a place\r\n  After their qualities and gifts. Yea, I\r\n  Created, the Reposeful; I that live\r\n  Immortally, made all those mortal births:\r\n  For works soil not my essence, being works\r\n  Wrought uninvolved.[FN#7] Who knows me acting thus\r\n  Unchained by action, action binds not him;\r\n  And, so perceiving, all those saints of old\r\n  Worked, seeking for deliverance. Work thou\r\n  As, in the days gone by, thy fathers did.\r\n\r\n  Thou sayst, perplexed, It hath been asked before\r\n  By singers and by sages, \"What is act,\r\n  And what inaction? \"I will teach thee this,\r\n  And, knowing, thou shalt learn which work doth save\r\n  Needs must one rightly meditate those three--\r\n  Doing,--not doing,--and undoing. Here\r\n  Thorny and dark the path is! He who sees\r\n  How action may be rest, rest action--he\r\n  Is wisest 'mid his kind; he hath the truth!\r\n  He doeth well, acting or resting. Freed\r\n  In all his works from prickings of desire,\r\n  Burned clean in act by the white fire of truth,\r\n  The wise call that man wise; and such an one,\r\n  Renouncing fruit of deeds, always content.\r\n  Always self-satisfying, if he works,\r\n  Doth nothing that shall stain his separate soul,\r\n  Which--quit of fear and hope--subduing self--\r\n  Rejecting outward impulse--yielding up\r\n  To body's need nothing save body, dwells\r\n  Sinless amid all sin, with equal calm\r\n  Taking what may befall, by grief unmoved,\r\n  Unmoved by joy, unenvyingly; the same\r\n  In good and evil fortunes; nowise bound\r\n  By bond of deeds. Nay, but of such an one,\r\n  Whose crave is gone, whose soul is liberate,\r\n  Whose heart is set on truth--of such an one\r\n  What work he does is work of sacrifice,\r\n  Which passeth purely into ash and smoke\r\n  Consumed upon the altar! All's then God!\r\n  The sacrifice is Brahm, the ghee and grain\r\n  Are Brahm, the fire is Brahm, the flesh it eats\r\n  Is Brahm, and unto Brahm attaineth he\r\n  Who, in such office, meditates on Brahm.\r\n  Some votaries there be who serve the gods\r\n  With flesh and altar-smoke; but other some\r\n  Who, lighting subtler fires, make purer rite\r\n  With will of worship. Of the which be they\r\n  Who, in white flame of continence, consume\r\n  Joys of the sense, delights of eye and ear,\r\n  Forgoing tender speech and sound of song:\r\n  And they who, kindling fires with torch of Truth,\r\n  Burn on a hidden altar-stone the bliss\r\n  Of youth and love, renouncing happiness:\r\n  And they who lay for offering there their wealth,\r\n  Their penance, meditation, piety,\r\n  Their steadfast reading of the scrolls, their lore\r\n  Painfully gained with long austerities:\r\n  And they who, making silent sacrifice,\r\n  Draw in their breath to feed the flame of thought,\r\n  And breathe it forth to waft the heart on high,\r\n  Governing the ventage of each entering air\r\n  Lest one sigh pass which helpeth not the soul:\r\n  And they who, day by day denying needs,\r\n  Lay life itself upon the altar-flame,\r\n  Burning the body wan. Lo! all these keep\r\n  The rite of offering, as if they slew\r\n  Victims; and all thereby efface much sin.\r\n  Yea! and who feed on the immortal food\r\n  Left of such sacrifice, to Brahma pass,\r\n  To The Unending. But for him that makes\r\n  No sacrifice, he hath nor part nor lot\r\n  Even in the present world. How should he share\r\n  Another, O thou Glory of thy Line?\r\n\r\n  In sight of Brahma all these offerings\r\n  Are spread and are accepted! Comprehend\r\n  That all proceed by act; for knowing this,\r\n  Thou shalt be quit of doubt. The sacrifice\r\n  Which Knowledge pays is better than great gifts\r\n  Offered by wealth, since gifts' worth--O my Prince!\r\n  Lies in the mind which gives, the will that serves:\r\n  And these are gained by reverence, by strong search,\r\n  By humble heed of those who see the Truth\r\n  And teach it. Knowing Truth, thy heart no more\r\n  Will ache with error, for the Truth shall show\r\n  All things subdued to thee, as thou to Me.\r\n  Moreover, Son of Pandu! wert thou worst\r\n  Of all wrong-doers, this fair ship of Truth\r\n  Should bear thee safe and dry across the sea\r\n  Of thy transgressions. As the kindled flame\r\n  Feeds on the fuel till it sinks to ash,\r\n  So unto ash, Arjuna! unto nought\r\n  The flame of Knowledge wastes works' dross away!\r\n  There is no purifier like thereto\r\n  In all this world, and he who seeketh it\r\n  Shall find it--being grown perfect--in himself.\r\n  Believing, he receives it when the soul\r\n  Masters itself, and cleaves to Truth, and comes--\r\n  Possessing knowledge--to the higher peace,\r\n  The uttermost repose. But those untaught,\r\n  And those without full faith, and those who fear\r\n  Are shent; no peace is here or other where,\r\n  No hope, nor happiness for whoso doubts.\r\n  He that, being self-contained, hath vanquished doubt,\r\n  Disparting self from service, soul from works,\r\n  Enlightened and emancipate, my Prince!\r\n  Works fetter him no more! Cut then atwain\r\n  With sword of wisdom, Son of Bharata!\r\n  This doubt that binds thy heart-beats! cleave the bond\r\n  Born of thy ignorance! Be bold and wise!\r\n  Give thyself to the field with me! Arise!\r\n\r\n  HERE ENDETH CHAPTER IV. OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA,\r\n  Entitled \"Jnana Yog,\"\r\n  Or \"The Book of the Religion of Knowledge,\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\n  Arjuna.\r\n  Yet, Krishna! at the one time thou dost laud\r\n  Surcease of works, and, at another time,\r\n  Service through work. Of these twain plainly tell\r\n  Which is the better way?\r\n\r\n  Krishna.\r\n  To cease from works\r\n  Is well, and to do works in holiness\r\n  Is well; and both conduct to bliss supreme;\r\n  But of these twain the better way is his\r\n  Who working piously refraineth not.\r\n\r\n  That is the true Renouncer, firm and fixed,\r\n  Who--seeking nought, rejecting nought--dwells proof\r\n  Against the \"opposites.\"[FN#8] O valiant Prince!\r\n  In doing, such breaks lightly from all deed:\r\n  'Tis the new scholar talks as they were two,\r\n  This Sankhya and this Yoga: wise men know\r\n  Who husbands one plucks golden fruit of both!\r\n  The region of high rest which Sankhyans reach\r\n  Yogins attain. Who sees these twain as one\r\n  Sees with clear eyes! Yet such abstraction, Chief!\r\n  Is hard to win without much holiness.\r\n  Whoso is fixed in holiness, self-ruled,\r\n  Pure-hearted, lord of senses and of self,\r\n  Lost in the common life of all which lives--\r\n  A \"Yogayukt\"--he is a Saint who wends\r\n  Straightway to Brahm. Such an one is not touched\r\n  By taint of deeds. \"Nought of myself I do!\"\r\n  Thus will he think-who holds the truth of truths--\r\n  In seeing, hearing, touching, smelling; when\r\n  He eats, or goes, or breathes; slumbers or talks,\r\n  Holds fast or loosens, opes his eyes or shuts;\r\n  Always assured \"This is the sense-world plays\r\n  With senses.\"He that acts in thought of Brahm,\r\n  Detaching end from act, with act content,\r\n  The world of sense can no more stain his soul\r\n  Than waters mar th' enamelled lotus-leaf.\r\n  With life, with heart, with mind,-nay, with the help\r\n  Of all five senses--letting selfhood go--\r\n  Yogins toil ever towards their souls' release.\r\n  Such votaries, renouncing fruit of deeds,\r\n  Gain endless peace: the unvowed, the passion-bound,\r\n  Seeking a fruit from works, are fastened down.\r\n  The embodied sage, withdrawn within his soul,\r\n  At every act sits godlike in \"the town\r\n  Which hath nine gateways,\"[FN#9] neither doing aught\r\n  Nor causing any deed. This world's Lord makes\r\n  Neither the work, nor passion for the work,\r\n  Nor lust for fruit of work; the man's own self\r\n  Pushes to these! The Master of this World\r\n  Takes on himself the good or evil deeds\r\n  Of no man--dwelling beyond! Mankind errs here\r\n  By folly, darkening knowledge. But, for whom\r\n  That darkness of the soul is chased by light,\r\n  Splendid and clear shines manifest the Truth\r\n  As if a Sun of Wisdom sprang to shed\r\n  Its beams of dawn. Him meditating still,\r\n  Him seeking, with Him blended, stayed on Him,\r\n  The souls illuminated take that road\r\n  Which hath no turning back--their sins flung off\r\n  By strength of faith. [Who will may have this Light;\r\n  Who hath it sees.] To him who wisely sees,\r\n  The Brahman with his scrolls and sanctities,\r\n  The cow, the elephant, the unclean dog,\r\n  The Outcast gorging dog's meat, are all one.\r\n\r\n  The world is overcome--aye! even here!\r\n  By such as fix their faith on Unity.\r\n  The sinless Brahma dwells in Unity,\r\n  And they in Brahma. Be not over-glad\r\n  Attaining joy, and be not over-sad\r\n  Encountering grief, but, stayed on Brahma, still\r\n  Constant let each abide! The sage whose soul\r\n  Holds off from outer contacts, in himself\r\n  Finds bliss; to Brahma joined by piety,\r\n  His spirit tastes eternal peace. The joys\r\n  Springing from sense-life are but quickening wombs\r\n  Which breed sure griefs: those joys begin and end!\r\n  The wise mind takes no pleasure, Kunti's Son!\r\n  In such as those! But if a man shall learn,\r\n  Even while he lives and bears his body's chain,\r\n  To master lust and anger, he is blest!\r\n  He is the Yukta; he hath happiness,\r\n  Contentment, light, within: his life is merged\r\n  In Brahma's life; he doth Nirvana touch!\r\n  Thus go the Rishis unto rest, who dwell\r\n  With sins effaced, with doubts at end, with hearts\r\n  Governed and calm. Glad in all good they live,\r\n  Nigh to the peace of God; and all those live\r\n  Who pass their days exempt from greed and wrath,\r\n  Subduing self and senses, knowing the Soul!\r\n\r\n  The Saint who shuts outside his placid soul\r\n  All touch of sense, letting no contact through;\r\n  Whose quiet eyes gaze straight from fixed brows,\r\n  Whose outward breath and inward breath are drawn\r\n  Equal and slow through nostrils still and close;\r\n  That one-with organs, heart, and mind constrained,\r\n  Bent on deliverance, having put away\r\n  Passion, and fear, and rage;--hath, even now,\r\n  Obtained deliverance, ever and ever freed.\r\n  Yea! for he knows Me Who am He that heeds\r\n  The sacrifice and worship, God revealed;\r\n  And He who heeds not, being Lord of Worlds,\r\n  Lover of all that lives, God unrevealed,\r\n  Wherein who will shall find surety and shield!\r\n\r\n  HERE ENDS CHAPTER V. OF THE BHAGAVAD-GITA,\r\n  Entitled \"Karmasanyasayog,\"\r\n  Or \"The Book of Religion by Renouncing Fruit of Works.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\n  Krishna.\r\n  Therefore, who doeth work rightful to do,\r\n  Not seeking gain from work, that man, O Prince!\r\n  Is Sanyasi and Yogi--both in one\r\n  And he is neither who lights not the flame\r\n  Of sacrifice, nor setteth hand to task.\r\n\r\n  Regard as true Renouncer him that makes\r\n  Worship by work, for who renounceth not\r\n  Works not as Yogin. So is that well said:\r\n  \"By works the votary doth rise to faith,\r\n  And saintship is the ceasing from all works;\r\n  Because the perfect Yogin acts--but acts\r\n  Unmoved by passions and unbound by deeds,\r\n  Setting result aside.\r\n\r\n  Let each man raise\r\n  The Self by Soul, not trample down his Self,\r\n  Since Soul that is Self's friend may grow Self's foe.\r\n  Soul is Self's friend when Self doth rule o'er Self,\r\n  But Self turns enemy if Soul's own self\r\n  Hates Self as not itself.[FN#10]\r\n\r\n  The sovereign soul\r\n  Of him who lives self-governed and at peace\r\n  Is centred in itself, taking alike\r\n  Pleasure and pain; heat, cold; glory and shame.\r\n  He is the Yogi, he is Yukta, glad\r\n  With joy of light and truth; dwelling apart\r\n  Upon a peak, with senses subjugate\r\n  Whereto the clod, the rock, the glistering gold\r\n  Show all as one. By this sign is he known\r\n  Being of equal grace to comrades, friends,\r\n  Chance-comers, strangers, lovers, enemies,\r\n  Aliens and kinsmen; loving all alike,\r\n  Evil or good.\r\n\r\n  Sequestered should he sit,\r\n  Steadfastly meditating, solitary,\r\n  His thoughts controlled, his passions laid away,\r\n  Quit of belongings. In a fair, still spot\r\n  Having his fixed abode,--not too much raised,\r\n  Nor yet too low,--let him abide, his goods\r\n  A cloth, a deerskin, and the Kusa-grass.\r\n  There, setting hard his mind upon The One,\r\n  Restraining heart and senses, silent, calm,\r\n  Let him accomplish Yoga, and achieve\r\n  Pureness of soul, holding immovable\r\n  Body and neck and head, his gaze absorbed\r\n  Upon his nose-end,[FN#11] rapt from all around,\r\n  Tranquil in spirit, free of fear, intent\r\n  Upon his Brahmacharya vow, devout,\r\n  Musing on Me, lost in the thought of Me.\r\n  That Yojin, so devoted, so controlled,\r\n  Comes to the peace beyond,--My peace, the peace\r\n  Of high Nirvana!\r\n\r\n  But for earthly needs\r\n  Religion is not his who too much fasts\r\n  Or too much feasts, nor his who sleeps away\r\n  An idle mind; nor his who wears to waste\r\n  His strength in vigils. Nay, Arjuna! call\r\n  That the true piety which most removes\r\n  Earth-aches and ills, where one is moderate\r\n  In eating and in resting, and in sport;\r\n  Measured in wish and act; sleeping betimes,\r\n  Waking betimes for duty.\r\n\r\n  When the man,\r\n  So living, centres on his soul the thought\r\n  Straitly restrained--untouched internally\r\n  By stress of sense--then is he Yukta. See!\r\n  Steadfast a lamp burns sheltered from the wind;\r\n  Such is the likeness of the Yogi's mind\r\n  Shut from sense-storms and burning bright to Heaven.\r\n  When mind broods placid, soothed with holy wont;\r\n  When Self contemplates self, and in itself\r\n  Hath comfort; when it knows the nameless joy\r\n  Beyond all scope of sense, revealed to soul--\r\n  Only to soul! and, knowing, wavers not,\r\n  True to the farther Truth; when, holding this,\r\n  It deems no other treasure comparable,\r\n  But, harboured there, cannot be stirred or shook\r\n  By any gravest grief, call that state \"peace,\"\r\n  That happy severance Yoga; call that man\r\n  The perfect Yogin!\r\n\r\n  Steadfastly the will\r\n  Must toil thereto, till efforts end in ease,\r\n  And thought has passed from thinking. Shaking off\r\n  All longings bred by dreams of fame and gain,\r\n  Shutting the doorways of the senses close\r\n  With watchful ward; so, step by step, it comes\r\n  To gift of peace assured and heart assuaged,\r\n  When the mind dwells self-wrapped, and the soul broods\r\n  Cumberless. But, as often as the heart\r\n  Breaks--wild and wavering--from control, so oft\r\n  Let him re-curb it, let him rein it back\r\n  To the soul's governance; for perfect bliss\r\n  Grows only in the bosom tranquillised,\r\n  The spirit passionless, purged from offence,\r\n  Vowed to the Infinite. He who thus vows\r\n  His soul to the Supreme Soul, quitting sin,\r\n  Passes unhindered to the endless bliss\r\n  Of unity with Brahma. He so vowed,\r\n  So blended, sees the Life-Soul resident\r\n  In all things living, and all living things\r\n  In that Life-Soul contained. And whoso thus\r\n  Discerneth Me in all, and all in Me,\r\n  I never let him go; nor looseneth he\r\n  Hold upon Me; but, dwell he where he may,\r\n  Whate'er his life, in Me he dwells and lives,\r\n  Because he knows and worships Me, Who dwell\r\n  In all which lives, and cleaves to Me in all.\r\n  Arjuna! if a man sees everywhere--\r\n  Taught by his own similitude--one Life,\r\n  One Essence in the Evil and the Good,\r\n  Hold him a Yogi, yea! well-perfected!\r\n\r\n  Arjuna.\r\n  Slayer of Madhu! yet again, this Yog,\r\n  This Peace, derived from equanimity,\r\n  Made known by thee--I see no fixity\r\n  Therein, no rest, because the heart of men\r\n  Is unfixed, Krishna! rash, tumultuous,\r\n  Wilful and strong. It were all one, I think,\r\n  To hold the wayward wind, as tame man's heart.\r\n\r\n  Krishna.\r\n  Hero long-armed! beyond denial, hard\r\n  Man's heart is to restrain, and wavering;\r\n  Yet may it grow restrained by habit, Prince!\r\n  By wont of self-command. This Yog, I say,\r\n  Cometh not lightly to th' ungoverned ones;\r\n  But he who will be master of himself\r\n  Shall win it, if he stoutly strive thereto.\r\n\r\n  Arjuna.\r\n  And what road goeth he who, having faith,\r\n  Fails, Krishna! in the striving; falling back\r\n  From holiness, missing the perfect rule?\r\n  Is he not lost, straying from Brahma's light,\r\n  Like the vain cloud, which floats 'twixt earth and heaven\r\n  When lightning splits it, and it vanisheth?\r\n  Fain would I hear thee answer me herein,\r\n  Since, Krishna! none save thou can clear the doubt.\r\n\r\n  Krishna.\r\n  He is not lost, thou Son of Pritha! No!\r\n  Nor earth, nor heaven is forfeit, even for him,\r\n  Because no heart that holds one right desire\r\n  Treadeth the road of loss! He who should fail,\r\n  Desiring righteousness, cometh at death\r\n  Unto the Region of the Just; dwells there\r\n  Measureless years, and being born anew,\r\n  Beginneth life again in some fair home\r\n  Amid the mild and happy. It may chance\r\n  He doth descend into a Yogin house\r\n  On Virtue's breast; but that is rare! Such birth\r\n  Is hard to be obtained on this earth, Chief!\r\n  So hath he back again what heights of heart\r\n  He did achieve, and so he strives anew\r\n  To perfectness, with better hope, dear Prince!\r\n  For by the old desire he is drawn on\r\n  Unwittingly; and only to desire\r\n  The purity of Yog is to pass\r\n  Beyond the Sabdabrahm, the spoken Ved.\r\n  But, being Yogi, striving strong and long,\r\n  Purged from transgressions, perfected by births\r\n  Following on births, he plants his feet at last\r\n  Upon the farther path. Such as one ranks\r\n  Above ascetics, higher than the wise,\r\n  Beyond achievers of vast deeds! Be thou\r\n  Yogi Arjuna! And of such believe,\r\n  Truest and best is he who worships Me\r\n  With inmost soul, stayed on My Mystery!\r\n\r\n  HERE ENDETH CHAPTER VI.

Know! I am that womb:\r\n  I make and I unmake this Universe:\r\n  Than me there is no other Master, Prince!\r\n  No other Maker! All these hang on me\r\n  As hangs a row of pearls upon its string.\r\n  I am the fresh taste of the water; I\r\n  The silver of the moon, the gold o' the sun,\r\n  The word of worship in the Veds, the thrill\r\n  That passeth in the ether, and the strength\r\n  Of man's shed seed. I am the good sweet smell\r\n  Of the moistened earth, I am the fire's red light,\r\n  The vital air moving in all which moves,\r\n  The holiness of hallowed souls, the root\r\n  Undying, whence hath sprung whatever is;\r\n  The wisdom of the wise, the intellect\r\n  Of the informed, the greatness of the great.\r\n  The splendour of the splendid. Kunti's Son!\r\n  These am I, free from passion and desire;\r\n  Yet am I right desire in all who yearn,\r\n  Chief of the Bharatas! for all those moods,\r\n  Soothfast, or passionate, or ignorant,\r\n  Which Nature frames, deduce from me; but all\r\n  Are merged in me--not I in them! The world--\r\n  Deceived by those three qualities of being--\r\n  Wotteth not Me Who am outside them all,\r\n  Above them all, Eternal! Hard it is\r\n  To pierce that veil divine of various shows\r\n  Which hideth Me; yet they who worship Me\r\n  Pierce it and pass beyond.\r\n\r\n  I am not known\r\n  To evil-doers, nor to foolish ones,\r\n  Nor to the base and churlish; nor to those\r\n  Whose mind is cheated by the show of things,\r\n  Nor those that take the way of Asuras.[FN#12]\r\n\r\n  Four sorts of mortals know me: he who weeps,\r\n  Arjuna! and the man who yearns to know;\r\n  And he who toils to help; and he who sits\r\n  Certain of me, enlightened.\r\n\r\n  Of these four,\r\n  O Prince of India! highest, nearest, best\r\n  That last is, the devout soul, wise, intent\r\n  Upon \"The One.\" Dear, above all, am I\r\n  To him; and he is dearest unto me!\r\n  All four are good, and seek me; but mine own,\r\n  The true of heart, the faithful--stayed on me,\r\n  Taking me as their utmost blessedness,\r\n  They are not \"mine,\"but I--even I myself!\r\n  At end of many births to Me they come!\r\n  Yet hard the wise Mahatma is to find,\r\n  That man who sayeth, \"All is Vasudev!\"[FN#13]\r\n\r\n  There be those, too, whose knowledge, turned aside\r\n  By this desire or that, gives them to serve\r\n  Some lower gods, with various rites, constrained\r\n  By that which mouldeth them. Unto all such--\r\n  Worship what shrine they will, what shapes, in faith--\r\n  'Tis I who give them faith! I am content!\r\n  The heart thus asking favour from its God,\r\n  Darkened but ardent, hath the end it craves,\r\n  The lesser blessing--but 'tis I who give!\r\n  Yet soon is withered what small fruit they reap:\r\n  Those men of little minds, who worship so,\r\n  Go where they worship, passing with their gods.\r\n  But Mine come unto me! Blind are the eyes\r\n  Which deem th' Unmanifested manifest,\r\n  Not comprehending Me in my true Self!\r\n  Imperishable, viewless, undeclared,\r\n  Hidden behind my magic veil of shows,\r\n  I am not seen by all; I am not known--\r\n  Unborn and changeless--to the idle world.\r\n  But I, Arjuna! know all things which were,\r\n  And all which are, and all which are to be,\r\n  Albeit not one among them knoweth Me!\r\n\r\n  By passion for the \"pairs of opposites,\"\r\n  By those twain snares of Like and Dislike, Prince!\r\n  All creatures live bewildered, save some few\r\n  Who, quit of sins, holy in act, informed,\r\n  Freed from the \"opposites,\"and fixed in faith,\r\n  Cleave unto Me.\r\n\r\n  Who cleave, who seek in Me\r\n  Refuge from birth[FN#14] and death, those have the Truth!\r\n  Those know Me BRAHMA; know Me Soul of Souls,\r\n  The ADHYATMAN; know KARMA, my work;\r\n  Know I am ADHIBHUTA, Lord of Life,\r\n  And ADHIDAIVA, Lord of all the Gods,\r\n  And ADHIYAJNA, Lord of Sacrifice;\r\n  Worship Me well, with hearts of love and faith,\r\n  And find and hold me in the hour of death.\r\n\r\n  HERE ENDETH CHAPTER VII.

What that Soul of Souls,\r\n  The ADHYATMAN? What, Thou Best of All!\r\n  Thy work, the KARMA? Tell me what it is\r\n  Thou namest ADHIBHUTA? What again\r\n  Means ADHIDAIVA? Yea, and how it comes\r\n  Thou canst be ADHIYAJNA in thy flesh?\r\n  Slayer of Madhu! Further, make me know\r\n  How good men find thee in the hour of death?\r\n\r\n  Krishna.\r\n  I BRAHMA am! the One Eternal GOD,\r\n  And ADHYATMAN is My Being's name,\r\n  The Soul of Souls! What goeth forth from Me,\r\n  Causing all life to live, is KARMA called:\r\n  And, Manifested in divided forms,\r\n  I am the ADHIBHUTA, Lord of Lives;\r\n  And ADHIDAIVA, Lord of all the Gods,\r\n  Because I am PURUSHA, who begets.\r\n  And ADHIYAJNA, Lord of Sacrifice,\r\n  I--speaking with thee in this body here--\r\n  Am, thou embodied one! (for all the shrines\r\n  Flame unto Me!) And, at the hour of death,\r\n  He that hath meditated Me alone,\r\n  In putting off his flesh, comes forth to Me,\r\n  Enters into My Being--doubt thou not!\r\n  But, if he meditated otherwise\r\n  At hour of death, in putting off the flesh,\r\n  He goes to what he looked for, Kunti's Son!\r\n  Because the Soul is fashioned to its like.\r\n\r\n  Have Me, then, in thy heart always! and fight!\r\n  Thou too, when heart and mind are fixed on Me,\r\n  Shalt surely come to Me! All come who cleave\r\n  With never-wavering will of firmest faith,\r\n  Owning none other Gods: all come to Me,\r\n  The Uttermost, Purusha, Holiest!\r\n\r\n  Whoso hath known Me, Lord of sage and singer,\r\n     Ancient of days; of all the Three Worlds Stay,\r\n  Boundless,--but unto every atom Bringer\r\n     Of that which quickens it: whoso, I say,\r\n\r\n  Hath known My form, which passeth mortal knowing;\r\n    Seen my effulgence--which no eye hath seen--\r\n  Than the sun's burning gold more brightly glowing,\r\n    Dispersing darkness,--unto him hath been\r\n\r\n  Right life! And, in the hour when life is ending,\r\n    With mind set fast and trustful piety,\r\n  Drawing still breath beneath calm brows unbending,\r\n    In happy peace that faithful one doth die,--\r\n\r\n  In glad peace passeth to Purusha's heaven.\r\n     The place which they who read the Vedas name\r\n  AKSHARAM, \"Ultimate;\" whereto have striven\r\n     Saints and ascetics--their road is the same.\r\n\r\n  That way--the highest way--goes he who shuts\r\n  The gates of all his senses, locks desire\r\n  Safe in his heart, centres the vital airs\r\n  Upon his parting thought, steadfastly set;\r\n  And, murmuring OM, the sacred syllable--\r\n  Emblem of BRAHM--dies, meditating Me.\r\n\r\n  For who, none other Gods regarding, looks\r\n  Ever to Me, easily am I gained\r\n  By such a Yogi; and, attaining Me,\r\n  They fall not--those Mahatmas--back to birth,\r\n  To life, which is the place of pain, which ends,\r\n  But take the way of utmost blessedness.\r\n\r\n  The worlds, Arjuna!--even Brahma's world--\r\n  Roll back again from Death to Life's unrest;\r\n  But they, O Kunti's Son! that reach to Me,\r\n  Taste birth no more. If ye know Brahma's Day\r\n  Which is a thousand Yugas; if ye know\r\n  The thousand Yugas making Brahma's Night,\r\n  Then know ye Day and Night as He doth know!\r\n  When that vast Dawn doth break, th' Invisible\r\n  Is brought anew into the Visible;\r\n  When that deep Night doth darken, all which is\r\n  Fades back again to Him Who sent it forth;\r\n  Yea! this vast company of living things--\r\n  Again and yet again produced--expires\r\n  At Brahma's Nightfall; and, at Brahma's Dawn,\r\n  Riseth, without its will, to life new-born.\r\n  But--higher, deeper, innermost--abides\r\n  Another Life, not like the life of sense,\r\n  Escaping sight, unchanging. This endures\r\n  When all created things have passed away:\r\n  This is that Life named the Unmanifest,\r\n  The Infinite! the All! the Uttermost.\r\n  Thither arriving none return. That Life\r\n  Is Mine, and I am there! And, Prince! by faith\r\n  Which wanders not, there is a way to come\r\n  Thither. I, the PURUSHA, I Who spread\r\n  The Universe around me--in Whom dwell\r\n  All living Things--may so be reached and seen!\r\n\r\n  .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .

They sink anew\r\n  Into the realm of Flesh, where all things change!\r\n\r\n  By Me the whole vast Universe of things\r\n  Is spread abroad;--by Me, the Unmanifest!\r\n  In Me are all existences contained;\r\n  Not I in them!\r\n\r\n  Yet they are not contained,\r\n  Those visible things! Receive and strive to embrace\r\n  The mystery majestical! My Being--\r\n  Creating all, sustaining all--still dwells\r\n  Outside of all!\r\n\r\n  See! as the shoreless airs\r\n  Move in the measureless space, but are not space,\r\n  [And space were space without the moving airs];\r\n  So all things are in Me, but are not I.\r\n\r\n  At closing of each Kalpa, Indian Prince!\r\n  All things which be back to My Being come:\r\n  At the beginning of each Kalpa, all\r\n  Issue new-born from Me.\r\n\r\n  By Energy\r\n  And help of Prakriti my outer Self,\r\n  Again, and yet again, I make go forth\r\n  The realms of visible things--without their will--\r\n  All of them--by the power of Prakriti.\r\n\r\n  Yet these great makings, Prince! involve Me not\r\n  Enchain Me not! I sit apart from them,\r\n  Other, and Higher, and Free; nowise attached!\r\n\r\n  Thus doth the stuff of worlds, moulded by Me,\r\n  Bring forth all that which is, moving or still,\r\n  Living or lifeless! Thus the worlds go on!\r\n\r\n  The minds untaught mistake Me, veiled in form;--\r\n  Naught see they of My secret Presence, nought\r\n  Of My hid Nature, ruling all which lives.\r\n  Vain hopes pursuing, vain deeds doing; fed\r\n  On vainest knowledge, senselessly they seek\r\n  An evil way, the way of brutes and fiends.\r\n  But My Mahatmas, those of noble soul\r\n  Who tread the path celestial, worship Me\r\n  With hearts unwandering,--knowing Me the Source,\r\n  Th' Eternal Source, of Life.

I see\r\n  Thy thousand thousand arms, and breasts, and faces,\r\n  And eyes,--on every side\r\n  Perfect, diversified;\r\n  And nowhere end of Thee, nowhere beginning,\r\n  Nowhere a centre! Shifts--\r\n  Wherever soul's gaze lifts--\r\n  Thy central Self, all-wielding, and all-winning!\r\n\r\n  Infinite King! I see\r\n  The anadem on Thee,\r\n  The club, the shell, the discus; see Thee burning\r\n  In beams insufferable,\r\n  Lighting earth, heaven, and hell\r\n  With brilliance blazing, glowing, flashing; turning\r\n\r\n  Darkness to dazzling day,\r\n  Look I whichever way;\r\n  Ah, Lord! I worship Thee, the Undivided,\r\n  The Uttermost of thought,\r\n  The Treasure-Palace wrought\r\n  To hold the wealth of the worlds; the Shield provided\r\n\r\n  To shelter Virtue's laws;\r\n  The Fount whence Life's stream draws\r\n  All waters of all rivers of all being:\r\n  The One Unborn, Unending:\r\n  Unchanging and Unblending!\r\n  With might and majesty, past thought, past seeing!\r\n\r\n  Silver of moon and gold\r\n  Of sun are glories rolled\r\n  From Thy great eyes; Thy visage, beaming tender\r\n  Throughout the stars and skies,\r\n  Doth to warm life surprise\r\n  Thy Universe.

Highest Majesty!\"\r\n  From sage and singer breaks the hymn of glory\r\n  In dulcet harmony,\r\n  Sounding the praise of Thee;\r\n  While countless companies take up the story,\r\n\r\n  Rudras, who ride the storms,\r\n  Th' Adityas' shining forms,\r\n  Vasus and Sadhyas, Viswas, Ushmapas;\r\n  Maruts, and those great Twins\r\n  The heavenly, fair, Aswins,\r\n  Gandharvas, Rakshasas, Siddhas, and Asuras,[FN#22]--\r\n\r\n  These see Thee, and revere\r\n  In sudden-stricken fear;\r\n  Yea! the Worlds,--seeing Thee with form stupendous,\r\n  With faces manifold,\r\n  With eyes which all behold,\r\n  Unnumbered eyes, vast arms, members tremendous,\r\n\r\n  Flanks, lit with sun and star,\r\n  Feet planted near and far,\r\n  Tushes of terror, mouths wrathful and tender;--\r\n  The Three wide Worlds before Thee\r\n  Adore, as I adore Thee,\r\n  Quake, as I quake, to witness so much splendour!\r\n\r\n  I mark Thee strike the skies\r\n  With front, in wondrous wise\r\n  Huge, rainbow-painted, glittering; and thy mouth\r\n  Opened, and orbs which see\r\n  All things, whatever be\r\n  In all Thy worlds, east, west, and north and south.\r\n\r\n  O Eyes of God! O Head!\r\n  My strength of soul is fled,\r\n  Gone is heart's force, rebuked is mind's desire!\r\n  When I behold Thee so,\r\n  With awful brows a-glow,\r\n  With burning glance, and lips lighted by fire\r\n\r\n  Fierce as those flames which shall\r\n  Consume, at close of all,\r\n  Earth, Heaven! Ah me! I see no Earth and Heaven!\r\n  Thee, Lord of Lords! I see,\r\n  Thee only-only Thee!\r\n  Now let Thy mercy unto me be given,\r\n\r\n  Thou Refuge of the World!\r\n  Lo! to the cavern hurled\r\n  Of Thy wide-opened throat, and lips white-tushed,\r\n  I see our noblest ones,\r\n  Great Dhritarashtra's sons,\r\n  Bhishma, Drona, and Karna, caught and crushed!\r\n\r\n  The Kings and Chiefs drawn in,\r\n  That gaping gorge within;\r\n  The best of both these armies torn and riven!\r\n  Between Thy jaws they lie\r\n  Mangled full bloodily,\r\n  Ground into dust and death! Like streams down-driven\r\n\r\n  With helpless haste, which go\r\n  In headlong furious flow\r\n  Straight to the gulfing deeps of th' unfilled ocean,\r\n  So to that flaming cave\r\n  Those heroes great and brave\r\n  Pour, in unending streams, with helpless motion!\r\n\r\n  Like moths which in the night\r\n  Flutter towards a light,\r\n  Drawn to their fiery doom, flying and dying,\r\n  So to their death still throng,\r\n  Blind, dazzled, borne along\r\n  Ceaselessly, all those multitudes, wild flying!\r\n\r\n  Thou, that hast fashioned men,\r\n  Devourest them again,\r\n  One with another, great and small, alike!\r\n  The creatures whom Thou mak'st,\r\n  With flaming jaws Thou tak'st,\r\n  Lapping them up! Lord God! Thy terrors strike\r\n\r\n  From end to end of earth,\r\n  Filling life full, from birth\r\n  To death, with deadly, burning, lurid dread!\r\n  Ah, Vishnu! make me know\r\n  Why is Thy visage so?\r\n  Who art Thou, feasting thus upon Thy dead?\r\n\r\n  Who? awful Deity!\r\n  I bow myself to Thee,\r\n  Namostu Te, Devavara! Prasid![FN#23]\r\n  O Mightiest Lord! rehearse\r\n  Why hast Thou face so fierce?\r\n  Whence doth this aspect horrible proceed?\r\n\r\n  Krishna.\r\n  Thou seest Me as Time who kills,\r\n  Time who brings all to doom,\r\n  The Slayer Time, Ancient of Days, come hither to consume;\r\n  Excepting thee, of all these hosts of hostile chiefs arrayed,\r\n  There stands not one shall leave alive the battlefield! Dismayed\r\n  No longer be! Arise! obtain renown! destroy thy foes!\r\n  Fight for the kingdom waiting thee when thou hast vanquished those.\r\n  By Me they fall--not thee! the stroke of death is dealt them now,\r\n  Even as they show thus gallantly; My instrument art thou!\r\n  Strike, strong-armed Prince, at Drona! at Bhishma strike! deal death\r\n  On Karna, Jyadratha; stay all their warlike breath!\r\n  'Tis I who bid them perish! Thou wilt but slay the slain;\r\n  Fight! they must fall, and thou must live, victor upon this plain!\r\n\r\n  Sanjaya.\r\n  Hearing mighty Keshav's word,\r\n  Tremblingly that helmed Lord\r\n  Clasped his lifted palms, and--praying\r\n  Grace of Krishna--stood there, saying,\r\n  With bowed brow and accents broken,\r\n  These words, timorously spoken:\r\n\r\n  Arjuna.\r\n  Worthily, Lord of Might!\r\n  The whole world hath delight\r\n  In Thy surpassing power, obeying Thee;\r\n  The Rakshasas, in dread\r\n  At sight of Thee, are sped\r\n  To all four quarters; and the company\r\n\r\n  Of Siddhas sound Thy name.\r\n  How should they not proclaim\r\n  Thy Majesties, Divinest, Mightiest?\r\n  Thou Brahm, than Brahma greater!\r\n  Thou Infinite Creator!\r\n  Thou God of gods, Life's Dwelling-place and Rest!\r\n\r\n  Thou, of all souls the Soul!\r\n  The Comprehending Whole!\r\n  Of being formed, and formless being the Framer;\r\n  O Utmost One! O Lord!\r\n  Older than eld, Who stored\r\n  The worlds with wealth of life! O Treasure-Claimer,\r\n\r\n  Who wottest all, and art\r\n  Wisdom Thyself! O Part\r\n  In all, and All; for all from Thee have risen\r\n  Numberless now I see\r\n  The aspects are of Thee!\r\n  Vayu[FN#24] Thou art, and He who keeps the prison\r\n\r\n  Of Narak, Yama dark;\r\n  And Agni's shining spark;\r\n  Varuna's waves are Thy waves. Moon and starlight\r\n  Are Thine! Prajapati\r\n  Art Thou, and 'tis to Thee\r\n  They knelt in worshipping the old world's far light,\r\n\r\n  The first of mortal men.\r\n  Again, Thou God! again\r\n  A thousand thousand times be magnified!\r\n  Honour and worship be--\r\n  Glory and praise,--to Thee\r\n  Namo, Namaste, cried on every side;\r\n\r\n  Cried here, above, below,\r\n  Uttered when Thou dost go,\r\n  Uttered where Thou dost come! Namo! we call;\r\n  Namostu! God adored!\r\n  Namostu! Nameless Lord!\r\n  Hail to Thee! Praise to Thee! Thou One in all;\r\n\r\n  For Thou art All! Yea, Thou!\r\n  Ah! if in anger now\r\n  Thou shouldst remember I did think Thee Friend,\r\n  Speaking with easy speech,\r\n  As men use each to each;\r\n  Did call Thee \"Krishna,\" \"Prince,\" nor comprehend\r\n\r\n  Thy hidden majesty,\r\n  The might, the awe of Thee;\r\n  Did, in my heedlessness, or in my love,\r\n  On journey, or in jest,\r\n  Or when we lay at rest,\r\n  Sitting at council, straying in the grove,\r\n\r\n  Alone, or in the throng,\r\n  Do Thee, most Holy! wrong,\r\n  Be Thy grace granted for that witless sin!\r\n  For Thou art, now I know,\r\n  Father of all below,\r\n  Of all above, of all the worlds within\r\n\r\n  Guru of Gurus; more\r\n  To reverence and adore\r\n  Than all which is adorable and high!\r\n  How, in the wide worlds three\r\n  Should any equal be?\r\n  Should any other share Thy Majesty?\r\n\r\n  Therefore, with body bent\r\n  And reverent intent,\r\n  I praise, and serve, and seek Thee, asking grace.\r\n  As father to a son,\r\n  As friend to friend, as one\r\n  Who loveth to his lover, turn Thy face\r\n\r\n  In gentleness on me!\r\n  Good is it I did see\r\n  This unknown marvel of Thy Form! But fear\r\n  Mingles with joy! Retake,\r\n  Dear Lord! for pity's sake\r\n  Thine earthly shape, which earthly eyes may bear!\r\n\r\n  Be merciful, and show\r\n  The visage that I know;\r\n  Let me regard Thee, as of yore, arrayed\r\n  With disc and forehead-gem,\r\n  With mace and anadem,\r\n  Thou that sustainest all things! Undismayed\r\n\r\n  Let me once more behold\r\n  The form I loved of old,\r\n  Thou of the thousand arms and countless eyes!\r\n  This frightened heart is fain\r\n  To see restored again\r\n  My Charioteer, in Krishna's kind disguise.\r\n\r\n  Krishna.\r\n  Yea! thou hast seen, Arjuna! because I loved thee well,\r\n  The secret countenance of Me, revealed by mystic spell,\r\n  Shining, and wonderful, and vast, majestic, manifold,\r\n  Which none save thou in all the years had favour to behold;\r\n  For not by Vedas cometh this, nor sacrifice, nor alms,\r\n  Nor works well-done, nor penance long, nor prayers, nor chaunted\r\n  psalms,\r\n  That mortal eyes should bear to view the Immortal Soul unclad,\r\n  Prince of the Kurus! This was kept for thee alone! Be glad!\r\n  Let no more trouble shake thy heart, because thine eyes have seen\r\n  My terror with My glory. As I before have been\r\n  So will I be again for thee; with lightened heart behold!\r\n  Once more I am thy Krishna, the form thou knew'st of old!\r\n\r\n  Sanjaya.\r\n  These words to Arjuna spake\r\n  Vasudev, and straight did take\r\n  Back again the semblance dear\r\n  Of the well-loved charioteer;\r\n  Peace and joy it did restore\r\n  When the Prince beheld once more\r\n  Mighty BRAHMA's form and face\r\n  Clothed in Krishna's gentle grace.\r\n\r\n  Arjuna.\r\n  Now that I see come back, Janardana!\r\n  This friendly human frame, my mind can think\r\n  Calm thoughts once more; my heart beats still again!\r\n\r\n  Krishna.\r\n  Yea! it was wonderful and terrible\r\n  To view me as thou didst, dear Prince! The gods\r\n  Dread and desire continually to view!\r\n  Yet not by Vedas, nor from sacrifice,\r\n  Nor penance, nor gift-giving, nor with prayer\r\n  Shall any so behold, as thou hast seen!\r\n  Only by fullest service, perfect faith,\r\n  And uttermost surrender am I known\r\n  And seen, and entered into, Indian Prince!\r\n  Who doeth all for Me; who findeth Me\r\n  In all; adoreth always; loveth all\r\n  Which I have made, and Me, for Love's sole end\r\n  That man, Arjuna! unto Me doth wend.\r\n\r\n  HERE ENDETH CHAPTER XI.

Cling thou to Me!\r\n  Clasp Me with heart and mind! so shalt thou dwell\r\n  Surely with Me on high. But if thy thought\r\n  Droops from such height; if thou be'st weak to set\r\n  Body and soul upon Me constantly,\r\n  Despair not! give Me lower service! seek\r\n  To reach Me, worshipping with steadfast will;\r\n  And, if thou canst not worship steadfastly,\r\n  Work for Me, toil in works pleasing to Me!\r\n  For he that laboureth right for love of Me\r\n  Shall finally attain! But, if in this\r\n  Thy faint heart fails, bring Me thy failure! find\r\n  Refuge in Me! let fruits of labour go,\r\n  Renouncing hope for Me, with lowliest heart,\r\n  So shalt thou come; for, though to know is more\r\n  Than diligence, yet worship better is\r\n  Than knowing, and renouncing better still.\r\n  Near to renunciation--very near--\r\n  Dwelleth Eternal Peace!\r\n\r\n  Who hateth nought\r\n  Of all which lives, living himself benign,\r\n  Compassionate, from arrogance exempt,\r\n  Exempt from love of self, unchangeable\r\n  By good or ill; patient, contented, firm\r\n  In faith, mastering himself, true to his word,\r\n  Seeking Me, heart and soul; vowed unto Me,--\r\n  That man I love! Who troubleth not his kind,\r\n  And is not troubled by them; clear of wrath,\r\n  Living too high for gladness, grief, or fear,\r\n  That man I love! Who, dwelling quiet-eyed,[FN#25]\r\n  Stainless, serene, well-balanced, unperplexed,\r\n  Working with Me, yet from all works detached,\r\n  That man I love!

Where this\r\n  With Ignorance are absent, Passion rules;\r\n  And Ignorance in hearts not good nor quick.\r\n  When at all gateways of the Body shines\r\n  The Lamp of Knowledge, then may one see well\r\n  Soothfastness settled in that city reigns;\r\n  Where longing is, and ardour, and unrest,\r\n  Impulse to strive and gain, and avarice,\r\n  Those spring from Passion--Prince!--engrained; and where\r\n  Darkness and dulness, sloth and stupor are,\r\n  'Tis Ignorance hath caused them, Kuru Chief!\r\n\r\n  Moreover, when a soul departeth, fixed\r\n  In Soothfastness, it goeth to the place--\r\n  Perfect and pure--of those that know all Truth.\r\n  If it departeth in set habitude\r\n  Of Impulse, it shall pass into the world\r\n  Of spirits tied to works; and, if it dies\r\n  In hardened Ignorance, that blinded soul\r\n  Is born anew in some unlighted womb.\r\n\r\n  The fruit of Soothfastness is true and sweet;\r\n  The fruit of lusts is pain and toil; the fruit\r\n  Of Ignorance is deeper darkness.

OF THE  BHAGAVAD-GITA,\r\n  Entitled \"Sraddhatrayavibhagayog,\"\r\n  Or \"The Book of Religion by the Threefold Kinds of Faith.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\n  Arjuna.\r\n  Fain would I better know, Thou Glorious One!\r\n  The very truth--Heart's Lord!--of Sannyas,\r\n  Abstention; and  enunciation, Lord!\r\n  Tyaga; and what separates these twain!\r\n\r\n  Krishna.\r\n  The poets rightly teach that Sannyas\r\n  Is the foregoing of all acts which spring\r\n  Out of desire; and their wisest say\r\n  Tyaga is renouncing fruit of acts.\r\n\r\n  There be among the saints some who have held\r\n  All action sinful, and to be renounced;\r\n  And some who answer, \"Nay! the goodly acts--\r\n  As worship, penance, alms--must be performed!\"\r\n  Hear now My sentence, Best of Bharatas!\r\n\r\n  'Tis well set forth, O Chaser of thy Foes!\r\n  Renunciation is of threefold form,\r\n  And Worship, Penance, Alms, not to be stayed;\r\n  Nay, to be gladly done; for all those three\r\n  Are purifying waters for true souls!\r\n\r\n  Yet must be practised even those high works\r\n  In yielding up attachment, and all fruit\r\n  Produced by works. This is My judgment, Prince!\r\n  This My insuperable and fixed decree!\r\n\r\n  Abstaining from a work by right prescribed\r\n  Never is meet! So to abstain doth spring\r\n  From \"Darkness,\" and Delusion teacheth it.\r\n  Abstaining from a work grievous to flesh,\r\n  When one saith \"'Tis unpleasing!\" this is null!\r\n  Such an one acts from \"passion;\" nought of gain\r\n  Wins his Renunciation! But, Arjun!\r\n  Abstaining from attachment to the work,\r\n  Abstaining from rewardment in the work,\r\n  While yet one doeth it full faithfully,\r\n  Saying, \"Tis right to do!\" that is \"true \" act\r\n  And abstinence! Who doeth duties so,\r\n  Unvexed if his work fail, if it succeed\r\n  Unflattered, in his own heart justified,\r\n  Quit of debates and doubts, his is \"true\" act:\r\n  For, being in the body, none may stand\r\n  Wholly aloof from act; yet, who abstains\r\n  From profit of his acts is abstinent.\r\n\r\n  The fruit of labours, in the lives to come,\r\n  Is threefold for all men,--Desirable,\r\n  And Undesirable, and mixed of both;\r\n  But no fruit is at all where no work was.\r\n\r\n  Hear from me, Long-armed Lord! the makings five\r\n  Which go to every act, in Sankhya taught\r\n  As necessary. First the force; and then\r\n  The agent; next, the various instruments;\r\n  Fourth, the especial effort; fifth, the God.\r\n  What work soever any mortal doth\r\n  Of body, mind, or speech, evil or good,\r\n  By these five doth he that. Which being thus,\r\n  Whoso, for lack of knowledge, seeth himself\r\n  As the sole actor, knoweth nought at all\r\n  And seeth nought. Therefore, I say, if one--\r\n  Holding aloof from self--with unstained mind\r\n  Should slay all yonder host, being bid to slay,\r\n  He doth not slay; he is not bound thereby!\r\n\r\n  Knowledge, the thing known, and the mind which knows,\r\n  These make the threefold starting-ground of act.\r\n  The act, the actor, and the instrument,\r\n  These make the threefold total of the deed.\r\n  But knowledge, agent, act, are differenced\r\n  By three dividing qualities. Hear now\r\n  Which be the qualities dividing them.\r\n\r\n  There is \"true\" Knowledge. Learn thou it is this:\r\n  To see one changeless Life in all the Lives,\r\n  And in the Separate, One Inseparable.\r\n  There is imperfect Knowledge: that which sees\r\n  The separate existences apart,\r\n  And, being separated, holds them real.\r\n  There is false Knowledge: that which blindly clings\r\n  To one as if 'twere all, seeking no Cause,\r\n  Deprived of light, narrow, and dull, and \"dark.\"\r\n\r\n  There is \"right\" Action: that which being enjoined--\r\n  Is wrought without attachment, passionlessly,\r\n  For duty, not for love, nor hate, nor gain.\r\n  There is \"vain\" Action: that which men pursue\r\n  Aching to satisfy desires, impelled\r\n  By sense of self, with all-absorbing stress:\r\n  This is of Rajas--passionate and vain.\r\n  There is \"dark\" Action: when one doth a thing\r\n  Heedless of issues, heedless of the hurt\r\n  Or wrong for others, heedless if he harm\r\n  His own soul--'tis of Tamas, black and bad!\r\n\r\n  There is the \"rightful\"doer. He who acts\r\n  Free from self-seeking, humble, resolute,\r\n  Steadfast, in good or evil hap the same,\r\n  Content to do aright-he \"truly\" acts.\r\n  There is th' \"impassioned\" doer. He that works\r\n  From impulse, seeking profit, rude and bold\r\n  To overcome, unchastened; slave by turns\r\n  Of sorrow and of joy: of Rajas he!\r\n  And there be evil doers; loose of heart,\r\n  Low-minded, stubborn, fraudulent, remiss,\r\n  Dull, slow, despondent--children of the \"dark.\"\r\n\r\n  Hear, too, of Intellect and Steadfastness\r\n  The threefold separation, Conqueror-Prince!\r\n  How these are set apart by Qualities.\r\n\r\n  Good is the Intellect which comprehends\r\n  The coming forth and going back of life,\r\n  What must be done, and what must not be done,\r\n  What should be feared, and what should not be feared,\r\n  What binds and what emancipates the soul:\r\n  That is of Sattwan, Prince! of \"soothfastness.\"\r\n  Marred is the Intellect which, knowing right\r\n  And knowing wrong, and what is well to do\r\n  And what must not be done, yet understands\r\n  Nought with firm mind, nor as the calm truth is:\r\n  This is of Rajas, Prince! and \"passionate!\"\r\n  Evil is Intellect which, wrapped in gloom,\r\n  Looks upon wrong as right, and sees all things\r\n  Contrariwise of Truth. O Pritha's Son!\r\n  That is of Tamas, \"dark\" and desperate!\r\n\r\n  Good is the steadfastness whereby a man\r\n  Masters his beats of heart, his very breath\r\n  Of life, the action of his senses; fixed\r\n  In never-shaken faith and piety:\r\n  That is of Sattwan, Prince! \"soothfast\" and fair!\r\n  Stained is the steadfastness whereby a man\r\n  Holds to his duty, purpose, effort, end,\r\n  For life's sake, and the love of goods to gain,\r\n  Arjuna! 'tis of Rajas, passion-stamped!\r\n  Sad is the steadfastness wherewith the fool\r\n  Cleaves to his sloth, his sorrow, and his fears,\r\n  His folly and despair. This--Pritha's Son!--\r\n  Is born of Tamas, \"dark\" and miserable!\r\n\r\n\r\n  Hear further, Chief of Bharatas! from Me\r\n  The threefold kinds of Pleasure which there be.\r\n\r\n  Good Pleasure is the pleasure that endures,\r\n  Banishing pain for aye; bitter at first\r\n  As poison to the soul, but afterward\r\n  Sweet as the taste of Amrit. Drink of that!\r\n  It springeth in the Spirit's deep content.\r\n  And painful Pleasure springeth from the bond\r\n  Between the senses and the sense-world. Sweet\r\n  As Amrit is its first taste, but its last\r\n  Bitter as poison. 'Tis of Rajas, Prince!\r\n  And foul and \"dark\" the Pleasure is which springs\r\n  From sloth and sin and foolishness; at first\r\n  And at the last, and all the way of life\r\n  The soul bewildering. 'Tis of Tamas, Prince!\r\n\r\n  For nothing lives on earth, nor 'midst the gods\r\n  In utmost heaven, but hath its being bound\r\n  With these three Qualities, by Nature framed.\r\n\r\n  The work of Brahmans, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas,\r\n  And Sudras, O thou Slayer of thy Foes!\r\n  Is fixed by reason of the Qualities\r\n  Planted in each:\r\n\r\n  A Brahman's virtues, Prince!\r\n  Born of his nature, are serenity,\r\n  Self-mastery, religion, purity,\r\n  Patience, uprightness, learning, and to know\r\n  The truth of things which be. A Kshatriya's pride,\r\n  Born of his nature, lives in valour, fire,\r\n  Constancy, skilfulness, spirit in fight,\r\n  And open-handedness and noble mien,\r\n  As of a lord of men. A Vaisya's task,\r\n  Born with his nature, is to till the ground,\r\n  Tend cattle, venture trade. A Sudra's state,\r\n  Suiting his nature, is to minister.\r\n\r\n  Whoso performeth--diligent, content--\r\n  The work allotted him, whate'er it be,\r\n  Lays hold of perfectness! Hear how a man\r\n  Findeth perfection, being so content:\r\n  He findeth it through worship--wrought by work--\r\n  Of Him that is the Source of all which lives,\r\n  Of HIM by Whom the universe was stretched.\r\n\r\n  Better thine own work is, though done with fault,\r\n  Than doing others' work, ev'n excellently.\r\n  He shall not fall in sin who fronts the task\r\n  Set him by Nature's hand! Let no man leave\r\n  His natural duty, Prince! though it bear blame!\r\n  For every work hath blame, as every flame\r\n  Is wrapped in smoke! Only that man attains\r\n  Perfect surcease of work whose work was wrought\r\n  With mind unfettered, soul wholly subdued,\r\n  Desires for ever dead, results renounced.\r\n\r\n  Learn from me, Son of Kunti! also this,\r\n  How one, attaining perfect peace, attains\r\n  BRAHM, the supreme, the highest height of all!\r\n\r\n  Devoted--with a heart grown pure, restrained\r\n  In lordly self-control, forgoing wiles\r\n  Of song and senses, freed from love and hate,\r\n  Dwelling 'mid solitudes, in diet spare,\r\n  With body, speech, and will tamed to obey,\r\n  Ever to holy meditation vowed,\r\n  From passions liberate, quit of the Self,\r\n  Of arrogance, impatience, anger, pride;\r\n  Freed from surroundings, quiet, lacking nought--\r\n  Such an one grows to oneness with the BRAHM;\r\n  Such an one, growing one with BRAHM, serene,\r\n  Sorrows no more, desires no more; his soul,\r\n  Equally loving all that lives, loves well\r\n  Me, Who have made them, and attains to Me.\r\n  By this same love and worship doth he know\r\n  Me as I am, how high and wonderful,\r\n  And knowing, straightway enters into Me.\r\n  And whatsoever deeds he doeth--fixed\r\n  In Me, as in his refuge--he hath won\r\n  For ever and for ever by My grace\r\n  Th' Eternal Rest! So win thou! In thy thoughts\r\n  Do all thou dost for Me! Renounce for Me!\r\n  Sacrifice heart and mind and will to Me!\r\n  Live in the faith of Me! In faith of Me\r\n  All dangers thou shalt vanquish, by My grace;\r\n  But, trusting to thyself and heeding not,\r\n  Thou can'st but perish! If this day thou say'st,\r\n  Relying on thyself, \"I will not fight!\"\r\n  Vain will the purpose prove! thy qualities\r\n  Would spur thee to the war. What thou dost shun,\r\n  Misled by fair illusions, thou wouldst seek\r\n  Against thy will, when the task comes to thee\r\n  Waking the promptings in thy nature set.\r\n  There lives a Master in the hearts of men\r\n  Maketh their deeds, by subtle  pulling--strings,\r\n  Dance to what tune HE will. With all thy soul\r\n  Trust Him, and take Him for thy succour, Prince!\r\n  So--only so, Arjuna!--shalt thou gain--\r\n  By grace of Him--the uttermost repose,\r\n  The Eternal Place!\r\n\r\n  Thus hath been opened thee\r\n  This Truth of Truths, the Mystery more hid\r\n  Than any secret mystery. Meditate!\r\n  And--as thou wilt--then act!\r\n\r\n  Nay! but once more\r\n  Take My last word, My utmost meaning have!\r\n  Precious thou art to Me; right well-beloved!\r\n  Listen! I tell thee for thy comfort this.\r\n  Give Me thy heart! adore Me! serve Me! cling\r\n  In faith and love and reverence to Me!\r\n  So shalt thou come to Me! I promise true,\r\n  For thou art sweet to Me!\r\n\r\n  And let go those--\r\n  Rites and writ duties! Fly to Me alone!\r\n  Make Me thy single refuge! I will free\r\n  Thy soul from all its  sins! Be of good cheer!\r\n\r\n  [Hide, the holy Krishna saith,\r\n  This from him that hath no faith,\r\n  Him that worships not, nor seeks\r\n  Wisdom's teaching when she speaks:\r\n  Hide it from all men who mock;\r\n  But, wherever, 'mid the flock\r\n  Of My lovers, one shall teach\r\n  This  divinest, wisest, speech--\r\n  Teaching in the faith to bring\r\n  Truth to them, and offering\r\n  Of all honour unto Me--\r\n  Unto Brahma cometh he!\r\n  Nay, and nowhere shall ye find\r\n  Any man of all mankind\r\n  Doing dearer deed for Me;\r\n  Nor shall any dearer be\r\n  In My earth. Yea, furthermore,\r\n  Whoso reads this converse o'er,\r\n  Held by Us upon the plain,\r\n  Pondering piously and fain,\r\n  He hath paid Me sacrifice!\r\n  (Krishna speaketh in this wise!)\r\n  Yea, and whoso, full of faith,\r\n  Heareth wisely what it saith,\r\n  Heareth meekly,--when he dies,\r\n  Surely shall his spirit rise\r\n  To those regions where the Blest,\r\n  Free of flesh, in joyance rest.]\r\n\r\n  Hath this been heard by thee, O Indian Prince!\r\n  With mind intent? hath all the ignorance--\r\n  Which bred thy trouble--vanished, My Arjun?\r\n\r\n  Arjuna.\r\n  Trouble and ignorance are gone! the Light\r\n  Hath come unto me, by Thy favour, Lord!\r\n  Now am I fixed! my doubt is fled away!\r\n  According to Thy word, so will I do!\r\n\r\n  Sanjaya.\r\n  Thus gathered I the gracious speech of Krishna, O my King!\r\n  Thus have I told, with heart a-thrill, this wise and wondrous thing\r\n  By great Vyasa's learning writ, how Krishna's self made known\r\n  The Yoga, being Yoga's Lord. So is the high truth shown!\r\n  And aye, when I remember, O Lord my King, again\r\n  Arjuna and the God in talk, and all this holy strain,\r\n  Great is my gladness: when I muse that splendour, passing speech,\r\n  Of Hari, visible and plain, there is no tongue to reach\r\n  My marvel and my love and bliss. O Archer-Prince! all hail!\r\n  O Krishna, Lord of Yoga! surely there shall not fail\r\n  Blessing, and victory, and power, for Thy most mighty sake,\r\n  Where this song comes of Arjun, and how with God he spake.\r\n\r\n  HERE ENDS, WITH CHAPTER XVIII.,\r\n  Entitled \"Mokshasanyasayog,\"\r\n  Or \"The Book of Religion by Deliverance and Renunciation,\"\r\n  THE BHAGAVAD-GITA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[FN#1]  Some repetitionary lines are here omitted.\r\n\r\n[FN#2]  Technical phrases of Vedic religion.\r\n\r\n[FN#3]  The whole of this passage is highly involved and difficult to\r\nrender.\r\n\r\n[FN#4]  I feel convinced sankhyanan and yoginan must be transposed\r\nhere in sense.\r\n\r\n[FN#5]  I am doubtful of accuracy here.\r\n\r\n[FN#6]  A name of the sun.\r\n\r\n[FN#7]  Without desire of fruit.\r\n\r\n[FN#8]  That is,\"joy and sorrow, success and failure, heat and cold,\"&c.\r\n\r\n[FN#9]  i.e., the body.\r\n\r\n[FN#10]  The Sanskrit has this play on the double meaning of Atman.\r\n\r\n[FN#11]  So in original.\r\n\r\n[FN#12]  Beings of low and devilish nature.\r\n\r\n[FN#13]  Krishna.\r\n\r\n[FN#14]  I read here janma, \"birth;\" not jara,\"age\"\r\n\r\n[FN#15]  I have discarded ten lines of Sanskrit text here as an\r\nundoubted interpolation by some Vedantist\r\n\r\n[FN#16]  The Sanskrit poem here rises to an elevation of style and\r\nmanner which I have endeavoured to mark by change of metre.\r\n\r\n[FN#17]  Ahinsa.\r\n\r\n[FN#18]  The nectar of immortality.\r\n\r\n[FN#19]  Called \"The Jap.\"\r\n\r\n[FN#20]  The compound form of Sanskrit words.\r\n\r\n[FN#21]  \"Kamalapatraksha\"\r\n\r\n[FN#22]  These are all divine or deified orders of the Hindoo Pantheon.\r\n\r\n[FN#23]  \"Hail to Thee, God of Gods!
