A Ritual Committee was appointed, and in 1878 the\r\nGeneral Grand Chapter adopted the work, and it was published by its\r\nauthority. At the session in 1883, a committee on Ritual was appointed,\r\nwith instructions to receive all proper amendments, and report the same\r\nat the next meeting. In 1886, the Committee was continued. At the\r\nsession in 1889, the Ritual Committee, consisting of Jerome Spaulding,\r\nMary A. Hepler and Lorraine J. Pitkin, presented the following Ritual as\r\nthe result of their labors, which was adopted.\r\n\r\nWe hereby certify the following to be the Ritual as revised at the\r\nsession of the General Grand Chapter, September, 1889.\r\n\r\n_Nettie Ransford,\r\nM.

It has no\r\njurisdiction over matters not specifically given to its control by that\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             GRAND CHAPTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe authority of a Grand Chapter is supreme within its jurisdiction,\r\nexcepting upon matters which are within the control of the General Grand\r\nChapter. Its jurisdiction shall not include more than one State or\r\nTerritory.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SUBORDINATE CHAPTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe authority of a Subordinate Chapter is prescribed and limited by the\r\nGrand Chapter within whose jurisdiction it exists. Five Subordinate\r\nChapters within any State or Territory where no Grand Chapter exists,\r\nmay organize a Grand Chapter, possessing all the lawful powers of such a\r\nChapter within said State or Territory.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LANDMARKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A belief in the existence of a Supreme Being.\r\n\r\n2. In the Order of the Eastern Star there are only five degrees, known\r\nas Adah, the daughter; Ruth, the widow; Esther, the wife; Martha, the\r\nsister; and Electa, the mother.\r\n\r\n3. The name of the Order, the names of its degrees, and modes of\r\nrecognition are unchangeable.\r\n\r\n4. Its lessons are Scriptural, its teachings moral, and its purposes\r\nbeneficent.\r\n\r\n5. Its obligations are based upon the honor of those who obtain its\r\nsecrets, and are framed upon the principle that whatever benefits are\r\ndue by Masons to the wives, daughters, mothers, widows and sisters of\r\nMasons, reciprocal duties are due from them to the Brotherhood.\r\n\r\n6. That the obligation of our Order, voluntarily assumed, is perpetual,\r\nfrom the force of which there is no release.\r\n\r\n7. The ballot, for candidates for the degrees, or membership, must be\r\nunanimous, without debate, and kept inviolably secret.\r\n\r\n8. The degrees cannot be conferred unless a brother in good standing\r\nshall preside. He can call upon the Worthy Matron to assist in\r\nconferring the degrees.\r\n\r\n9. Every member is amenable to the laws of the Order, and may be tried\r\nfor offenses, either by the Chapter to which the member belongs, or by\r\nthe Chapter within whose jurisdiction the member resides.\r\n\r\n10. The right of every member to appeal from the decision of a\r\nSubordinate Chapter, to the Grand Chapter or its executive head.\r\n\r\n11. The right of every Chapter to decide, from among eligible\r\ncandidates, who shall be admitted to membership.\r\n\r\n12. The right of every member to visit any regular Chapter unless lawful\r\nobjection is made to such visitor.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SUBORDINATE CHAPTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery Subordinate Chapter must have a Charter or Dispensation legally\r\nissued, and always present at its meetings, without which it cannot\r\nlegally act.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               OFFICERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe officers of a Subordinate Chapter shall be:\r\n\r\n    WORTHY MATRON,\r\n    WORTHY PATRON,\r\n    ASSOCIATE MATRON,\r\n    SECRETARY,\r\n    TREASURER,\r\n    CONDUCTRESS,\r\n    ASSO. CONDUCTRESS,\r\n    ADAH,\r\n    RUTH,\r\n    ESTHER,\r\n    MARTHA,\r\n    ELECTA,\r\n    WARDER,\r\n    SENTINEL.\r\n    If desired:\r\n    CHAPLAIN.\r\n    MARSHAL.\r\n    ORGANIST.\r\n\r\nThe Stations of the several Officers are indicated on the Plan of\r\nChapter Room on page 12.\r\n\r\nThe first seven shall be elected by separate and majority ballot, and\r\nthe others shall be appointed by the Worthy Matron.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               MEETINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe meetings of a Chapter are either regular or special. Regular\r\nmeetings are those held at stated intervals as prescribed by its\r\nBy-laws. Special meetings are those held by appointment of the Worthy\r\nMatron or other lawful authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                QUORUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeven members, including one of the first three officers, shall\r\nconstitute a quorum for the transaction of business, unless the By-laws\r\nof the Chapter shall prescribe a larger number.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PETITIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA petition for the degrees or membership must be signed by the\r\npetitioner and two members of the Chapter, who recommend the petitioner.\r\nThe petition must be received at a regular meeting of the Chapter,\r\nunless the Grand Chapter of its jurisdiction shall otherwise provide;\r\nand when received, must be referred to a committee of three members, one\r\nof whom shall be a brother, appointed by the presiding officer. The\r\ncommittee can only report at a regular meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE BALLOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ballot upon petitions for the degrees or membership, can only be\r\ntaken at a regular meeting. The Associate Conductress shall have charge\r\nof the ballot-box, under the direction of the Worthy Matron. After it\r\nhas been examined by the Worthy Matron and Associate Matron, she shall\r\npresent it to the Worthy Matron and Worthy Patron for their ballot, and\r\nmay carry it to every member present--or _may_ place it upon the Altar.\r\nIf placed upon the Altar, every member entitled to a vote shall approach\r\nthe Altar from the West, between Ruth and Esther, make the sign of\r\nsalutation, deposit their ballot, leaving between Esther and Martha.\r\n\r\nThe member balloting must be at least three paces in advance of the one\r\nwho directly follows.\r\n\r\nWhen all have voted, the Worthy Matron shall declare the ballot closed,\r\nand direct the Associate Conductress to bear the ballot box West and\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nAfter it has been examined by the Associate Matron, the Matron will ask:\r\n\r\n_W. M._ Sister Associate Matron.\r\n\r\n_A. M._ Worthy Matron.\r\n\r\n_W. M._ How is the ballot in the West?\r\n\r\n    The Associate Matron will say:\r\n\r\n_A. M._ The ballot is clear, (or not clear,) Worthy Matron.\r\n\r\n    After the W. M. has inspected it, and no black balls appear, she\r\n    will say:\r\n\r\n_W. M._ The ballot being clear in the East, I have the pleasure to\r\ninform you that you have elected ---- to receive the degrees, (or become\r\na member,) in this Chapter.\r\n\r\n    If the ballot is not clear, but so nearly so that the result may\r\n    have been from mistake, a second and final ballot may be ordered. If\r\n    the final ballot is dark, the W. M. will say:\r\n\r\n_W. M._ The ballot not being clear, I have to announce that the petition\r\nof ---- is rejected.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              MEMBERSHIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nMembership can only be forfeited by dimission, suspension, or expulsion\r\nfrom a Chapter, excepting that the suspension or expulsion of a brother\r\nfrom a Masonic Lodge, for any other cause than non-payment of dues,\r\ndeprives him of all the rights of membership in this Order until\r\nreinstated by the Masonic body.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      BADGES, JEWELS, AND REGALIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe officers shall wear during Chapter sessions the badge of office\r\nbelonging to their respective offices.

The Associate Conductress assumes her chair, and the\r\n    Worthy Patron, ascending the dais, gives one blow with the gavel.\r\n    After requesting all present who are not members of the Order to\r\n    retire, he says:\r\n\r\n_W. P._ Sister Associate Conductress.\r\n\r\n_A. C._ Worthy Patron.\r\n\r\n    Officers rise and respond, whenever addressed, and remain standing\r\n    until seated by an order from the East.\r\n\r\n_W.

P._ Sister Conductress, you will escort the Worthy Matron to the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\n    She does so, and the Worthy Matron ascending the dais, receives the\r\n    gavel and proceeds.\r\n\r\n    The use of the above ceremony is optional.\r\n\r\n_W.

If she is\r\n    unable to do so, she says:\r\n\r\n_A.

M._ You will inform the Sentinel that we are about to close the\r\nChapter, and direct him to permit no interruption while we are thus\r\nengaged.\r\n\r\n    The Warder in due order ** ** * * opens the door and informs the\r\n    Sentinel.\r\n\r\n_War._ Worthy Matron, your order has been obeyed.\r\n\r\n_W.

Bestow upon us in our\r\n    parting that spirit of affection which can resist the selfishness of\r\n    the world, and cause us to remember our obligations to each other\r\n    and to Thee. Grant that we may all be permitted with loving hearts\r\n    to assemble here again, for our instruction, for Thine honor, and\r\n    for the good of our fellow men. All of which we ask for Thy name's\r\n    sake. AMEN.\r\n\r\n    Response by all the members.\r\n\r\nSo may it ever be.\r\n\r\n    The Worthy Patron or Chaplain steps back into the circle of Star\r\n    officers between Esther and Martha facing East, remaining in that\r\n    position until the Worthy Matron closes the Chapter.\r\n\r\n_W. M._ Sister Conductress, you will attend at the Altar.\r\n\r\n    Conductress approaches the Altar as before, with the Sign of\r\n    Salutation, closes the Bible, makes a slight bow, steps back into\r\n    the circle of Star officers between Ruth and Esther, remaining until\r\n    Chapter is closed.\r\n\r\n_W. M._ Sisters and Brothers, we go forth into the world not knowing\r\nwhat trials may await us in the journey of life. Let us not be dismayed,\r\nfor our Heavenly Father has promised to strengthen and uphold us by the\r\nright hand of his power. Farewell.\r\n\r\n    Response by all the members.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\n_W. M._ I now declare ---- Chapter, No. --, closed. Sister Warder, you\r\nwill so instruct the Sentinel.\r\n\r\n    The Worthy Matron gives one blow with the gavel. The Warder informs\r\n    the Sentinel that the Chapter is closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Initiation Ceremonies.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Initiation Ceremony is the same for gentlemen as for ladies, and\r\n    both may receive the degrees at the same time. The necessary changes\r\n    in language must be made as circumstances require. The time having\r\n    arrived for initiation, and it being probable that candidates are in\r\n    waiting, if robes are used, the officers retire, and prepare for the\r\n    ceremony of initiation.\r\n\r\n_W. M._ Sister Associate Conductress.\r\n\r\n_A. C._ Worthy Matron.\r\n\r\n_W. M._ You will retire and ascertain if there are candidates in waiting\r\nto receive the degrees.\r\n\r\n    The Associate Conductress advances to the west of the Altar, gives\r\n    the Sign of Salutation, and (the Warder having given the usual raps\r\n    and opened the door,) retires. Ascertaining the name of the\r\n    candidate, she returns, and standing west of the Altar, gives the\r\n    Sign of Salutation and says:\r\n\r\n_A. C._ Worthy Matron, I find in waiting -- -- who is desirous of being\r\ninitiated into our Order.\r\n\r\n    The Worthy Matron invites the Worthy Patron to preside for the\r\n    purpose of conferring the degrees. The Worthy Patron, taking the\r\n    chair, says:\r\n\r\n_W. P._ Sister Secretary.\r\n\r\n_Sec'y._ Worthy Patron.\r\n\r\n_W. P._ Has this candidate been elected to receive the degrees of the\r\nOrder?\r\n\r\n_Sec'y._ She has, Worthy Patron.\r\n\r\n_W. P._ Sister Associate Conductress, you will retire and prepare the\r\ncandidate for the ceremonies of initiation.\r\n\r\n    She gives the sign, and retires as before. Taking the candidate into\r\n    the preparation room, she says:\r\n\r\n_A. C._ Do you believe in the existence of a Supreme Being? _Ans._ I do.\r\n\r\nMy friend, human life is a labyrinth through which we all wander\r\nblindly, and too often, in ignorance. It is good to consider the\r\nexperience of others, and profit by their knowledge and example. Having\r\nreceived the degrees of our Order, and therefore being able to assist\r\nyou, permit me to direct your preparation for the ceremonies of\r\ninitiation.\r\n\r\n    She then removes the candidate's hat, gloves and shawl or cloak,\r\n    prepares and leads her to the\r\n\r\n    door of the Chapter-room. The Associate Conductress gives five raps\r\n    upon the door, ** ** *\r\n\r\n_Cond._ Worthy Patron, there is an alarm at the door of the preparation\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n_W. P._ Sister Conductress, you will ascertain the cause of the alarm.\r\n\r\n    The Conductress goes to the door, answers the alarm, ** ** * * and\r\n    opening the door, says:\r\n\r\n_Cond._ Who knocks at the door of our Chapter?\r\n\r\n_A. C._ The Associate Conductress with a candidate, who desires to be\r\ninitiated into our Order.\r\n\r\n_Cond._ Is she properly prepared?\r\n\r\n_A. C._ She is.\r\n\r\n_Cond._ My friend, you will wait until further orders are received from\r\nthe Worthy Patron.\r\n\r\n    The Conductress closes the door, and, advancing to a position in\r\n    front of the Associate Matron, facing the East, says:\r\n\r\n_Cond._ Worthy Patron, the alarm was caused by the Associate Conductress\r\nwith a candidate, who desires to receive the degrees of our Order.\r\n\r\n_W. P._ Is the candidate properly prepared?\r\n\r\n_Cond._ She is.\r\n\r\n_W. P._ You will admit her.\r\n\r\n    The Conductress returning to the door, opens it wide, and says:\r\n\r\n_Cond._ It is the order of the Worthy Patron that you be admitted to our\r\nChapter.\r\n\r\n    Before the door is opened to receive the candidate the lights may be\r\n    turned down, and soft music played during this lecture by the\r\n    Conductress. The candidate is led inside the door and stopped. The\r\n    Conductress then says to her:\r\n\r\n_Cond._ You have doubtless well considered the step you have taken in\r\nseeking admission to this Order, dedicated to Charity, Truth, and\r\nLoving-kindness. You came here of your own free choice. Complain not,\r\ntherefore, at any trial. A seal is here set upon your lips. Let it warn\r\nyou to be ever silent and secret, as to all that may be made known to\r\nyou here. Be not weary in well-doing. Woe unto those who seek to take\r\nupon themselves burdens which they cannot bear. Woe unto the faithless\r\nand insincere, who assume obligations lightly and forthwith forget them.\r\n\"Trust in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not unto thine own\r\nunderstanding. In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He will direct thy\r\npaths.\"\r\n\r\n    Conductress offers her right arm to the candidate. If there are two\r\n    the Associate Conductress offers her left arm to the candidate and\r\n    in like manner follows with the second. The Associate Conductress\r\n    assists only when necessary to form couples. The candidate is\r\n    conducted once around the room to the Associate Matron. Officers and\r\n    members always observe square corners.\r\n\r\n    During the march, vocal or instrumental music is furnished, or the\r\n    Worthy Patron may recite the following:\r\n\r\n_W. P._ \"Though I speak with the tongues of men, and of angels, and have\r\nnot charity, I am become as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Charity suffereth long, and is kind: charity envieth not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now abideth Faith, Hope and Charity, but the greatest of these is\r\nCharity.\"\r\n\r\n    Having arrived at the West, the candidate is introduced to the\r\n    Associate Matron.\r\n\r\n_Cond._ Sister Associate Matron.\r\n\r\n_A. M._ Sister Conductress.\r\n\r\n_Cond._ I have the honor of introducing -- -- who is to be presented by\r\nyou to the Worthy Matron.\r\n\r\n_A. M._ My friend, you are heartily welcome. Sister Conductress, you\r\nwill cause the candidate to face the East.\r\n\r\n    Conductress and candidate face the East.\r\n\r\n_A. M._ Worthy Matron, I have the honor to present -- --whose petition\r\nhas been approved by this Chapter, and who is now ready to assume our\r\nObligation.\r\n\r\n    The Worthy Matron rises and addresses the candidate.\r\n\r\n_W. M._ It is with pleasure that I welcome you into this Chapter. Your\r\nrelation to the Masonic fraternity, and the recommendations presented in\r\nyour behalf, assure us that you merit the honor we confer, and are\r\nworthy of the important trust with which we are about to invest you. The\r\nOrder of the Eastern Star exists for the purpose of giving practical\r\neffect to one of the beneficent purposes of Freemasonry, which is to\r\nprovide for the welfare of the wives, daughters, mothers, widows, and\r\nsisters of Master Masons.\r\n\r\nHere they may share with the Masonic brother in promulgating the\r\nprinciples of Brotherly Love, Relief, and Truth.\r\n\r\nHere we may aid, comfort, and protect each other in our journey through\r\nthe labyrinth of human life, and by cheerful companionship and social\r\nenjoyments, lighten the burdens of active duty.\r\n\r\nBy means of secret signs, and other work of the Order, we are able to\r\nmake ourselves known to each other wherever we may meet.\r\n\r\nWe are governed by the laws and regulations of the Grand Chapter, and by\r\na code of By-Laws framed by ourselves. These we are bound to obey so\r\nlong as we remain members of the Order, and in this obedience, we shall\r\nexpect you to share.\r\n\r\n    Addressing the Worthy Patron, the Worthy Matron says:\r\n\r\nWorthy Patron, it is with pleasure that I introduce to you this\r\ncandidate, who is prepared to assume the Obligation of the Order.\r\n\r\n_W. P._ The obligation you are about to take is a solemn pledge which\r\nyou must give to this Chapter, before you can participate in the\r\nprivileges of our Order. By it you bind yourself to the most solemn\r\nsecrecy respecting the work of the Order, and to the performance of\r\nthose acts of kindness and forbearance, which are essential to our\r\nwelfare and prosperity.\r\n\r\nWith this knowledge of its requirements are you willing to proceed?\r\n\r\n_Cand._ I am.\r\n\r\n_W. P._ Sister Conductress, you will cause the candidate to be in proper\r\nposition at the Altar to receive the Obligation. (1.)\r\n\r\n    During the march there should be vocal or instrumental music.\r\n\r\n_Cond._ Worthy Patron, the candidate is in proper position.\r\n\r\n    The Chapter is called up, and the Worthy Patron takes his position\r\n    on the east side of the Altar, and causes the candidate to repeat\r\n    after him the following. Soft music may be played during obligation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              OBLIGATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * (2.) * * *\r\n\r\n_W. P._ Arise, my sister, we accept the pledge you have given, and share\r\nwith you in this solemn Obligation.\r\n\r\n    The Conductress takes the Bible from the candidate, when the Worthy\r\n    Patron says: \"Arise, my sister,\" he extends his right hand and\r\n    assists the candidate in rising, the lights are suddenly turned up\r\n    at the same time.\r\n\r\n_W. P._ You will now be received into our Order and be conducted to the\r\nseveral points of the Star, where you will receive instruction in those\r\nsublime virtues exemplified in the lives of Adah, Ruth, Esther, Martha,\r\nand Electa.\r\n\r\n    The Worthy Patron returns to the East, and seats the Chapter.\r\n\r\n    The Conductress and candidate will leave the Altar on the right,\r\n    passing out between Electa and Adah, leaving Adah on the right, all\r\n    around the outside of the Star to Adah for instruction.\r\n\r\n    During the march there should be vocal or instrumental music, or the\r\n    Worthy Patron may recite the following:\r\n\r\n_W. P._ \"Happy is the man that findeth wisdom and the man that getteth\r\nunderstanding.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is more precious than rubies, and all the things thou canst desire\r\nare not to be compared unto her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.\"\r\n\r\n_Cond._ Sister Adah.\r\n\r\n    Adah rises and takes her position at the right of her chair; after\r\n    each lecture the Star Officer will remain in her position, standing\r\n    until the Conductress and candidate have passed her, then be seated.\r\n\r\n_Adah._ Sister Conductress.\r\n\r\n_Cond._ I present this Sister, who, having assumed our Obligation, will\r\nreceive from you such lessons respecting fidelity to convictions of\r\nright and duty, as may properly be drawn from the history of Jephthah's\r\nDaughter.\r\n\r\n_Adah._ Jephthah was the ninth judge and one of the mightiest men in\r\nIsrael. Being called upon, in the extremity of his country's trials, to\r\ngo at the head of its armies, he prepared his household for a campaign\r\nthat would perhaps cost him his life; and then \"Jephthah vowed a vow\r\nunto the Lord, and said, 'If thou shalt deliver the children of Ammon\r\ninto mine hands then it shall be that whatsoever cometh forth of the\r\ndoors of my house to meet me when I return in peace shall surely be the\r\nLord's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.'\" Jephthah went\r\nforth to battle, the victory was gained, and the victorious warrior\r\nreturned to Mizpeh. The door of his house opened, and, \"behold! his\r\ndaughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances,\" and she\r\nwas his only child. Jephthah, when he saw her, rent his clothes, and in\r\nthe anguish of his heart, cried aloud, \"Alas, my daughter! thou hast\r\nbrought me very low, for I have opened my mouth unto the Lord, and I\r\ncannot go back.\" Adah replied, \"My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth\r\nunto the Lord, do to me according to that which has proceeded out of thy\r\nmouth.\" She asked that she might go among the mountains for two months,\r\nand there prepare her mind for the solemn surrender of her life to\r\npreserve her father's honor.\r\n\r\nWhen the two months had expired, she was seen, followed by her friends,\r\nwinding her way down the mountain's side to the altar, where her father\r\nwith an almost broken heart was prepared to fulfil his vow.\r\n\r\nShe approached her father with a kiss of affection and bade him\r\nfarewell. Taking hold of the veil she wore, he threw it over her face,\r\nand drew his sword. But she unveiled herself, and said she need not have\r\nher face covered for she was not afraid to die. Her father replied that\r\nhe could not strike the blow while she looked upon him, and again cast\r\nit over her. She threw it off the second time, and said she would look\r\nupward, that his arm might not be unnerved by her gaze. A third time,\r\nhowever, he insisted, and a third time she as resolutely cast it off,\r\nthis time holding the ends of it firmly in her hands and casting her\r\neyes upward, invited the fatal blow. And a deed was consummated which\r\nhas rendered the name of Jephthah's Daughter famous in the annals of\r\nScripture.\r\n\r\nThe sign of this degree is given by--\r\n\r\n    Repeat from secret work.

By the sword Adah was slain. The\r\nveil alludes to her determination to die in the light, suffering no\r\nstain to rest upon her memory.\r\n\r\nSister Conductress, you will present this sister at the second point of\r\nthe Star for further instruction.\r\n\r\n    The Conductress will lead the candidate around Adah's chair, leaving\r\n    the chair to the right, then across the Star, leaving the Altar to\r\n    the left, around Martha's chair, passing to Ruth for instruction.\r\n    After each lecture the labyrinth is followed in a similar manner,\r\n    always leaving the chairs to the right and the Altar to the left.\r\n    From Ruth around Electa to Esther; from Esther around Adah to\r\n    Martha; from Martha around Ruth to Electa; from Electa around Esther\r\n    to the Worthy Patron.\r\n\r\n    During the march there should be vocal or instrumental music, or the\r\n    Worthy Patron may recite the following:\r\n\r\n_W.

The sons married women of Moab named Ruth\r\nand Orphah. After a few years, Elimeleck and his sons died, leaving\r\nNaomi, Ruth and Orphah in mourning. Naomi, aged and dependent, resolved\r\nto return to the land of her nativity. She urged Ruth and Orphah to\r\nremain with their kindred and friends, rather than follow her in poverty\r\nto a land of strangers. But Ruth believed it to be her duty to remain\r\nwith Naomi and assist in her maintenance, saying, \"Entreat me not to\r\nleave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou\r\ngoest, I will go, and where thou lodgest I will lodge, thy people shall\r\nbe my people, and thy God my God.\"\r\n\r\nThey arrived in Bethlehem, destitute, weary and worn, and Ruth was\r\ncompelled to seek through menial labor the means of support for herself\r\nand the aged Naomi. Faithful to the duties which adverse fortune had\r\nthrown upon her, she became a gleaner in the fields of Boaz, who said to\r\nhis servant that was set over his reapers, \"Whose damsel is this?\" Upon\r\nbeing informed of her history, her devotion to Naomi, and present\r\ncircumstances, advanced to where she was resting and addressed to her\r\nkindly words of encouragement. Ruth raised her hands to show him how\r\nsmall were her gleanings, and that she had not taken from the sheaves;\r\nplaced them meekly upon her breast as proof of her willingness to submit\r\nto whatever lot she might be called upon to endure, casting her eyes\r\nupward, as appealing to God.\r\n\r\nHe ordered his reapers to drop handfuls of barley that she might gather\r\na supply, and invited her to eat and drink of the provisions he had\r\nsupplied. Ruth was encouraged; and at evening, returned laden with the\r\nfruits of her toil to gladden the heart of Naomi. My sister, be faithful\r\nto the duties of your station; ever teaching that honor and justice\r\nwhich Ruth portrayed in the touching and beautiful incidents of her\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe sign of this degree is given by--\r\n\r\n    Repeat from secret work.

The Jews were then held in captivity within\r\nthe Persian empire. After the divorce of Queen Vashti, the king caused\r\nsearch to be made throughout the empire for the most beautiful woman, to\r\nbe her successor. The choice fell upon Esther, who, amid national\r\nrejoicing and royal magnificence, became the queen of Persia.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of her descent from the captive race was carefully\r\nconcealed from the king and his court. In due time the enemies of the\r\nJews, being powerful and numerous, persuaded the king to issue a royal\r\nedict commanding that upon a given day the entire Hebrew race should be\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nQueen Esther, when informed of the cruel edict, resolved to risk the\r\nloss of royal favor and life itself, to save her people from death.\r\n\r\nIt was a law of the palace that no one, not even the queen, should enter\r\nthe king's presence unsummoned, under penalty of death, unless the king\r\nshould extend the golden sceptre as a signal of pardon.\r\n\r\nEsther, attired in her queenly apparel, with heroic purpose, sought the\r\npresence of the king. It was the day of the grand council of governors,\r\nprinces and officers of Persia. The royal guards held all avenues of\r\napproach to the council chamber. The king sat upon his throne of gold\r\nand ivory, surrounded by the highest officials of his empire. The queen\r\napproached. The guards and palace officials were stricken with terror at\r\nthe unbidden advance of the queen. The king's countenance flushed with\r\nanger when he beheld her intrusion. Queen Esther, fixing her eyes, now\r\neloquent with her soul's heroic purpose upon the king, firmly advanced\r\nto the foot of the throne, at once reminding him of his former pledges\r\nby touching her crown and robe in which he had desired her to appear\r\nwhen claiming his promise. She secured pardon by laying her hand upon\r\nthe golden sceptre which he extended to her. Graciously, said the king,\r\n\"What wilt thou, Queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be even\r\ngiven thee to the half of the kingdom.\" Esther's perilous adventure was\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThe king relented from his cruel purpose, and spared the chosen people.\r\n\r\nThe sign of this degree is given by--\r\n\r\n    Repeat from secret work.

P._ \"And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in\r\nthe court, that she obtained favor in his sight; and the king held out\r\nto Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near,\r\nand touched the top of the sceptre.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then said the king unto her, 'What wilt thou, Queen Esther? and what is\r\nthy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom.'\"\r\n\r\n_Cond._ Sister Martha.\r\n\r\n    Martha rises and takes her position at the _left_ of her chair.\r\n\r\n_Martha._ Sister Conductress.\r\n\r\n_Cond._ I present this sister to be instructed in the sublime virtue of\r\na trustful faith, in the hour of trial, and hope of immortal life, as\r\nillustrated in the history of Martha.\r\n\r\n_Martha._ The history of Martha is that of a young woman oppressed with\r\ngrief at the loss of an only brother.\r\n\r\nThe family, consisting of Martha, and Mary, and their brother Lazarus,\r\nwere residents of Bethany. They were known among the people of the\r\ncountry as followers of Christ. During the absence of Jesus, Lazarus was\r\ntaken ill, and in a short time died. At the close of the fourth day,\r\nintelligence reached them that Jesus was returning to Bethany. Martha\r\nhastened to meet him, raising her hands imploringly towards his face,\r\nlooking upward with suppressed emotion, cried aloud, \"Lord if thou hadst\r\nbeen here, my brother had not died. But I know that even now, whatsoever\r\nthou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Martha saith unto him, 'I know that he shall rise again in the\r\nresurrection at the last day.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Jesus saith unto her, I am the Resurrection and the Life, he that\r\nbelieveth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live, and whosoever\r\nliveth and believeth in me, shall never die. Believest thou this?\" Here\r\nis the record of her unfaltering trust; here the record of her hope,\r\ninspired by the teachings of Jesus, that beyond the grave, the loved\r\nones gone before are waiting to welcome us to our eternal home.\r\n\r\nIn the measureless realm of time, how brief is our earthly life; yet how\r\nmomentous and eternal its issues! Life's experiences, coming thick and\r\nfast, are the soul's appointed means of growth. To-day, we build our\r\ncastles, to-morrow, fickle fortune snatches from hope the promised joy.\r\nTo-day, prosperity or the presence of loved ones fills our cup with joy;\r\nto-morrow, adversity, or sore bereavement casts us into the valley of\r\nsorrow.\r\n\r\nMy sister, may you have the trustful faith of Martha; it will lighten\r\nthe burden of sorrow, and incline you to the voice of duty.\r\n\r\nThe sign of this degree is given by--\r\n\r\n    Repeat from secret work.

Her charity, benevolence, and generous\r\nhospitality to the poor entitled her to great distinction.\r\n\r\nHaving been reared a Pagan and afterwards becoming a convert to the\r\nChristian religion, she was subjected to severe trials and the most\r\nbitter persecution. An edict was issued by the Roman emperor that all\r\nfollowers of the Christ should renounce their faith under penalty of\r\ndeath. She was visited by a band of soldiers, one of whom handed her the\r\ncross, with a command to trample it under foot. Electa, looking him\r\nsteadily in the face, received the cross--precious emblem of her\r\nSaviour's blood--pressed it with ardor to her bosom, and cast her eyes\r\nupward as a testimony of her love and loyalty to her Christian faith. As\r\nElecta I represent this historical heroine, and commend to you the\r\nsublime virtue she exemplified through her life, \"that we love one\r\nanother.\" You may not be called upon to suffer in the same degree from\r\nthe hand of persecution--but there is always need of loyalty to Truth,\r\nand, alas, there is too often persecution.\r\n\r\nMy sister, be loyal to your convictions of truth, and murmur not at\r\nanother's loyalty. Let truth be spoken, and let it shine through your\r\nlife. If persecution comes, bear it with heroic endurance, and despair\r\nnot of the final triumph of Truth.\r\n\r\nThe sign of this degree is given by--\r\n\r\n    Repeat from secret work.

But woman's heart beats responsive to the same inspiration that\r\nprompts man to noble deeds.\r\n\r\nShe hears the cry of the orphan, the call of want, and the piteous wail\r\nof sorrow. She honors the Brotherhood for its noble work, and seeks\r\nthrough the Eastern Star, to be a co-worker with the Masonic brother; to\r\npay the tribute of her love and labor at the same shrine, and be able to\r\nmake herself known, throughout the domain of Masonry, as being entitled\r\nto its protection.\r\n\r\nInto this field of labor, you have now entered. You have taken the\r\nsolemn Obligation of the Order, and been instructed in those sublime\r\nvirtues which should adorn our lives, and make this institution worthy\r\nof the protection and support of all good Masons.\r\n\r\nWe extend to you a fraternal love, and shall rejoice to learn that your\r\ndevotion to the great moral and social purposes of our Order, is earnest\r\nand persistent.\r\n\r\nThat the blessing of our Heavenly Father may rest upon our labor, let us\r\nunite in prayer.\r\n\r\n    The Chapter is called up and a circle is formed around the Altar in\r\n    the following manner by the officers joining hands: Secretary\r\n    between Adah and Ruth--Associate Matron between Ruth and\r\n    Esther--Associate Conductress between Esther and Martha--Treasurer\r\n    between Martha and Electa--the Worthy Matron at the left of Electa.\r\n    If desired the members may join in forming the circle.\r\n\r\n    The Worthy Patron or Chaplain will take position at the west side of\r\n    the Altar. The Conductress with the candidate at her right, will\r\n    advance to the open space at the left of the Worthy Matron; and when\r\n    the words \"golden chain thus lengthened\" in the prayer are being\r\n    pronounced, the Worthy Matron will extend her left hand and take the\r\n    right hand of candidate and the Conductress will join the circle at\r\n    her left, thus making it complete. At the words \"each link shall\r\n    fall away in death,\" the hands will be unclasped. If a Chaplain\r\n    officiates, the Worthy Patron will remain in his station.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PRAYER.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Source of all wisdom, truth, and love, Grant we beseech Thee, that\r\n    in the reception of this person into our Order we may add strength\r\n    to our strength, and grace to our grace. O, may the golden chain\r\n    thus lengthened become the brighter for this link, and be\r\n    strengthened for the great work we strive to do. Enlarge our powers\r\n    to benefit mankind, and to honor Thee our God.\r\n\r\n    And when, one by one, each link shall fall away in death, may the\r\n    parting be temporary, and the meeting eternal. In the world where\r\n    death comes not, may we realize the full happiness of loving and\r\n    serving Thee forever. AMEN.\r\n\r\n    Response by the Chapter.\r\n\r\nSo may it ever be.\r\n\r\n    At the conclusion of the prayer an Ode may be sung while the members\r\n    are standing around the Altar. After singing the Worthy Patron seats\r\n    the Chapter. The Conductress leads the candidate to the East, and\r\n    the Worthy Matron may, at the request of the Worthy Patron, conclude\r\n    the initiation ceremonies.\r\n\r\n_W.

It is represented by the red rose.\r\n\r\nThe Lion is appropriate to Electa, as a symbol of the courage and power,\r\nthat sustained the martyr defenders of Truth.\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, my sister, Jephthah's Daughter, because she freely\r\nsacrificed her life to preserve her father's honor; Ruth, poor and\r\nlowly, was faithful to the demands of honor and justice; Esther, noble\r\nqueen, was prepared to sacrifice her crown and life, to save her people\r\nfrom destruction; Martha, from her trustful faith and hope of immortal\r\nlife; and Electa, pre-eminent in charity, and heroic in endurance of the\r\nwrongs of persecution; were (18.)\r\n\r\nSo may it be with you. As you illustrate in your life the virtues of\r\nthese tried servants of God, so shall be your reward.\r\n\r\nYou will now be conducted to the Secretary's desk, where you will sign\r\nthe By-Laws of this Chapter, and become entitled to all the privileges\r\nof membership; after which you will be re-conducted to your present\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n    While the candidate is signing the By-Laws, there may be vocal or\r\n    instrumental music. After signing the By-Laws the candidate is\r\n    conducted to the preparation room, disrobes if robes are used, a\r\n    badge of the Order put on, and conducted to the East, facing West.\r\n    When the door opens for the Conductress and candidate to return, the\r\n    Chapter is called up, and all join in singing a welcome song, after\r\n    which the Worthy Patron says:\r\n\r\n_W. P._ Sisters and Brothers, our sister has passed through the several\r\ndegrees of our Order, we hope with some pleasure to her, and we know\r\nwith great satisfaction to us. You will give her a hearty welcome and\r\nresume order at the sound of the gavel.\r\n\r\n    The Chapter takes a recess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Installation Ceremonies.\r\n\r\n\r\n    These ceremonies may be performed in public. If at a special\r\n    meeting, the Chapter will be declared open with one blow of the\r\n    Gavel. If regular, it may be opened in an adjacent room and business\r\n    postponed, adjourning to the Hall for installation, after which the\r\n    Worthy Matron will declare the Chapter closed.\r\n\r\n    The Installing Officer must be a Present or Past Matron or Patron.\r\n    The first board of officers of a new Chapter must be installed by a\r\n    Grand Matron or Patron, or a Deputy; who also may install the\r\n    officers of any Chapter when requested to do so by the Chapter.\r\n\r\n    The Installing Officer, after assuming the chair, will appoint a\r\n    Marshal, who will collect the several badges of office, and place\r\n    them where they will be convenient for use. The Secretary will\r\n    furnish the Marshal with a list of the officers to be installed. If\r\n    the installation is a public one, an address may be delivered\r\n    touching the history and purposes of the Order.\r\n\r\n    If a Grand officer presides, the Marshal will be Grand Marshal. The\r\n    officers will be addressed by their titles and such changes made in\r\n    the language of the following ceremonies as the circumstances\r\n    require.\r\n\r\n    Music, vocal or instrumental, may be introduced as may seem best.\r\n\r\n    After the appointment of the Marshal and the collection of the\r\n    badges of office, the installing officer will proceed as follows:\r\n\r\n_I. O._ Sisters and Brothers, the selection of a new board of officers\r\nis an important event in the history of a Chapter. The welfare of this\r\nChapter, and the prosperity of our Order in this place, may be\r\npermanently effected by the action of those whom you have chosen to\r\nserve as the officers of this Chapter for the ensuing year. Before\r\ninvesting them with official authority we will invoke the blessing of\r\nHim from whom cometh all wisdom and strength. Let us unite in prayer.\r\n\r\n    The Chapter is called up, and the Installing Officer or Chaplain\r\n    offers at the altar the following\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PRAYER.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Our Father, who art in Heaven, whose wisdom and goodness manifest\r\n    themselves in all the works of creation; with filial love and\r\n    reverence we invoke Thy blessing upon Thy children here assembled,\r\n    and grace to consecrate the labors we have met to perform. We\r\n    commend to Thy especial care and guidance the officers elect, into\r\n    whose hands we are about to repose the government of this Chapter.\r\n    Endue them with a just appreciation of the responsibilities they are\r\n    about to assume, and may they be ever mindful that a Father's care\r\n    is always over them, and that Thy all-seeing eye is ever upon them.\r\n\r\n    Bless and prosper our beloved Order; may it be known and honored\r\n    among the institutions of the land as one whose foundation is laid\r\n    upon the enduring principle of Truth. Direct our footsteps in ways\r\n    of pleasantness and paths of peace, and may all our doings reflect\r\n    honor upon Thy Holy Name. AMEN.\r\n\r\n    Response by the Chapter:\r\n\r\nSo may it ever be.\r\n\r\n    Seats the Chapter.\r\n\r\n_I. O._ Sister Marshal.\r\n\r\n_M._ Worthy ----\r\n\r\n_I. O._ You will call the roll of officers elect, who, as their names\r\nare called, will form a semi-circle on the west side of the altar,\r\nfacing the East, to receive the Obligation.\r\n\r\n    The W. M. on the extreme South, then followed by the W. P., A. M.,\r\n    etc. If the Warder and Sentinel are both called from their stations,\r\n    a brother will be appointed to attend at the door until the absent\r\n    officers return. Old officers not re-elected or appointed, may\r\n    occupy their stations until their successors are installed. When all\r\n    are in their places, the Marshal will say:\r\n\r\n_M._ Worthy ----, the officers-elect are in order, and await your\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n_I. O._ Sisters and brothers, you behold those who have been selected as\r\nofficers to serve you for the ensuing year. Do you still desire that\r\nthey shall fill the positions to which they have been elected or\r\nappointed?\r\n\r\n_Ans._ We do.\r\n\r\n    Calls up the Chapter.\r\n\r\n_I. O._ You will repeat after me the following\r\n\r\n\r\n                              OBLIGATION:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I solemnly and sincerely promise, in the presence of the members of\r\n    this Chapter, that I will, to the best of my ability, faithfully and\r\n    impartially perform all the duties belonging to the office for which\r\n    I have been selected. That I will conform to the By-Laws of this\r\n    Chapter, and the Constitution, Rules and Regulations of the Grand\r\n    Chapter, and do all in my power to promote the welfare and\r\n    prosperity of our Order.\r\n\r\n    The Chapter and officers will be seated. The Marshal will present\r\n    the officers at the altar for installation, approaching the altar\r\n    between Adah and Ruth and leaving between Martha and Electa.\r\n\r\n_I. O._ Sister Marshal, you will present the Worthy Matron elect for\r\ninstallation.\r\n\r\n_M._ Worthy ----, it is with pleasure that I present for installation\r\nSister ----, who has been elected Worthy Matron of this Chapter for the\r\nensuing year. Our sister is fully aware of the important responsibility\r\nthat rests upon her in the acceptance of this trust, yet she is willing\r\nto assume it, in the hope that by the aid of her sisters and brothers,\r\nand the favor of God, she will not prove altogether unworthy of the high\r\nhonor that has been conferred upon her.\r\n\r\n_I. O._ My sister, before proceeding with your investiture, it is\r\nnecessary that you signify your assent to those Regulations of the\r\nOrder, upon the strict observance of which its stability and success\r\ndepend.\r\n\r\nYou admit that the name, character, and modes of recognition of the\r\nOrder of the Eastern Star are unchangeable.\r\n\r\n_Ans._ I do.\r\n\r\nYou admit that a belief in the existence of a Supreme Being is one of\r\nthe requirements of the Order.\r\n\r\n_Ans._ I do.\r\n\r\nYou admit that the utmost care should be taken to admit to membership\r\nonly such persons as possess a good moral character.\r\n\r\n_Ans._ I do.\r\n\r\nYou admit that no new Chapter can be legally formed without a Charter or\r\nDispensation from the Grand Chapter within whose jurisdiction it is\r\nformed; that no countenance should be given to any illegally formed\r\nChapter, its members, or persons initiated therein.\r\n\r\n_Ans._ I do.\r\n\r\nYou promise to obey the Laws and Regulations of the Grand Chapter;\r\ntogether with the By-Laws of this Chapter, and to permit no violation of\r\nthem by its members.\r\n\r\n_Ans._ I do.\r\n\r\nYou promise that no visitor will be admitted to your Chapter, to witness\r\nthe secret work of the Order, unless found legally entitled to do so;\r\nand that none will be admitted who would injuriously effect the peace\r\nand harmony of the Chapter.\r\n\r\n_Ans._ I do.\r\n\r\nYou agree to do all in your power to promote the welfare of this\r\nChapter, and to enforce, to the best of your ability, all the rules and\r\nregulations of the Order.\r\n\r\n_Ans._ I do.\r\n\r\nMembers of ---- Chapter, you have heard your Worthy Matron elect in the\r\npledges she has made; do you promise to support her in the performance\r\nof her duties?\r\n\r\n_Ans._ We do.\r\n\r\nMy sister, the office of Worthy Matron is one of great responsibility,\r\nand it will require your utmost attention, wisdom and forbearance. The\r\nmembers will look to you, not only for counsel in all matters that come\r\nbefore the Chapter, but for advice and sympathy in their troubles and\r\nsorrows. It should be your constant study, therefore, how best to\r\ncultivate the social virtues, and avoid unpleasant misunderstandings\r\namong the members of your Chapter. You should be cautious in the\r\nexecution of your trust, courteous to the members, and ever ready to\r\nrender a helping hand to sisters or brothers in affliction or adversity.\r\nYou should set an example of good order and punctuality, for only by so\r\ndoing can you expect similar attention from others. Whatever you would\r\ndeem praiseworthy in another in your position, you should carefully\r\nimitate, and with equal care avoid what would be blameworthy. Within the\r\nChapter it will be your duty to see that its regular meetings are held,\r\nand special meetings called, whenever the good of the Chapter demands\r\nthem; that your subordinates fill their stations with honor and\r\nusefulness; that the By-Laws be implicitly obeyed; that the funds,\r\nrecords, rituals, and other property of the Chapter be properly\r\npreserved by the officers in whose charge they are placed; that the cry\r\nof the widow and orphan shall never be heard in vain; and that this\r\nChapter fails in nothing for which it was established. All this you\r\nshould strive to accomplish by the zealous exercise of your prerogatives\r\nas Worthy Matron, to which exalted position your associates have been\r\npleased to elect you.\r\n\r\nSister Marshal, you will invest our sister with the badge of her office.\r\n\r\n    The Marshal will invest the officers with their badges as she is\r\n    requested to do so by the Installing Officer.\r\n\r\n_I. O._ Your badge is the Gavel within the Star, an emblem of authority;\r\nadmonishing you that upon your judgment and discretion rests the\r\ngovernment of this Chapter, and, in a great measure, the prosperity of\r\nour beautiful Order.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Matron.]\r\n\r\nSister Marshal, you will conduct our sister to her station.\r\n\r\n    The Worthy Matron will ascend the dais, and, turning towards the\r\n    Chapter, stand in her station. The Installing Officer will call up\r\n    the Chapter and say:\r\n\r\n_I. O._ Worthy Matron, behold your sisters and brothers. Sisters and\r\nbrothers, behold your Worthy Matron, and salute her with the Grand\r\nHonors.\r\n\r\n    The Chapter responds by giving the Grand Honors, after which the\r\n    Chapter is seated. The Worthy Matron takes the chair on the left of\r\n    the Installing Officer.\r\n\r\n_I. O._ Sister Marshal, you will present the Worthy Patron elect for\r\ninstallation.\r\n\r\n_M._ Worthy ----, I have the pleasure of presenting, for installation,\r\nBrother ----, who has been elected Worthy Patron of this Chapter for the\r\nensuing year. His zeal in our cause, and qualifications for the\r\nposition, assure us that he will discharge the duties to the\r\nsatisfaction of the Chapter, and the honor and welfare of our Order.\r\n\r\n_I. O._ My brother, you have heard the pledges made by the Worthy Matron\r\nprevious to her installation. Do you also promise a faithful obedience\r\nto all those regulations?\r\n\r\n_Ans._ I do.\r\n\r\n_I. O._ My Brother, the station to which you have been elected is one of\r\nthe most important within the gift of the members of this Chapter, and\r\nyour election thereto the highest honor they can confer upon a Brother.\r\nFrom the nature of the Order you are not its chief officer, yet you are\r\nexpected to have a watchful care over the interests of the Chapter and\r\nsee that the Laws of the Order are promptly obeyed.\r\n\r\nIt is your duty to preside during the ceremony of Initiation and at\r\nother times when requested to do so by the Worthy Matron; to see that\r\nthe officers are thoroughly instructed in their duties, and that the\r\nritual work of the Order is properly rendered. It is also your duty to\r\nhave a general supervision over the affairs of the Chapter, and act as\r\nthe constitutional adviser of the Worthy Matron. To do this acceptably,\r\nyou must make yourself thoroughly familiar with the jurisprudence of the\r\nOrder, as promulgated in its established rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nSister Marshal, you will invest our brother with the badge of his\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n_I. O._ Your badge is the Square and Compasses within the Star, an\r\nemblem of the relationship existing between the Masonic Fraternity and\r\nthe Order of the Eastern Star, and admonishes you to be ever mindful of\r\nyour obligations to the Order.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Patron.]\r\n\r\nSister Marshal, you will conduct our brother to his station, at the left\r\nof the Worthy Matron.\r\n\r\n_I. O._ Sister Marshal, you will present the Associate Matron elect for\r\ninstallation.\r\n\r\n_M._ Worthy ----, I have the pleasure of presenting Sister ----, who has\r\nbeen elected Associate Matron of this Chapter for the ensuing year.\r\n\r\n_I. O._ My Sister, the duties of your position are embodied in the name\r\nof your office. You are the assistant to the Worthy Matron in all\r\nbranches of her responsible charge, and, in her absence, will succeed to\r\nall her privileges and prerogatives. It is necessary therefore, that you\r\nshould make yourself familiar with the duties of that office, so that\r\nyou may fill it with credit to yourself and honor to your Chapter.\r\n\r\nSister Marshal, you will invest our sister with the badge of her office.\r\n\r\n_I. O._ Your badge is the Sun within the Star, an emblem of light,\r\nadmonishing you that the principles of our Order should shine with\r\nundiminished lustre through our lives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Asso. Matron.]\r\n\r\nSister Marshal, you will conduct our sister to her station in the West.\r\n\r\n_I. O._ Sister Marshal, you will present the Secretary elect.\r\n\r\n_M._ Worthy ----, I have the pleasure of presenting Sister ----, who has\r\nbeen elected Secretary of this Chapter for the ensuing year.\r\n\r\n_I. O._ My sister, yours is a difficult and responsible charge. Failure\r\nor neglect on your part will complicate and embarrass all our\r\nproceedings, and give us a disgraceful record on the books of the Grand\r\nChapter. It is your duty to note in proper order, the business of our\r\nmeetings, to collect all moneys due the Chapter, and forward to the\r\nGrand Secretary the necessary returns, as required by the Constitution,\r\nand perform such other duties as properly belong to your office.\r\n\r\nSister Marshal, you will invest our sister with the badge of her office.\r\n\r\nYour badge is the Cross-pens within the Star, an emblem of intelligence,\r\nadmonishing you to be faithful to your trust, that the good deeds of\r\nyour companions may not go unrecorded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Secretary.]\r\n\r\nSister Marshal, you will conduct our sister to her station in the\r\nSouth-East.\r\n\r\n_I. O._ Sister Marshal, you will present the Treasurer elect.\r\n\r\n_M._ Worthy ----, I have the pleasure of presenting Sister ----, who has\r\nbeen elected Treasurer of this Chapter for the ensuing year.\r\n\r\n_I. O._ My sister, the proper preservation of our funds demands honesty\r\nand carefulness on the part of the Treasurer. The money placed in your\r\nhands may be required for charitable purposes at the most unexpected\r\nmoment, or to meet the necessary expenses of the Chapter.\r\n\r\nSister Marshal, you will invest our sister with the badge of her office.\r\n\r\nYour badge is the Cross-keys within the Star, an emblem of security,\r\nadmonishing you to the strictest fidelity in the discharge of your\r\nimportant trust, that the Chapter may not be embarrassed in its efforts\r\nto relieve the distressed and meet its necessary expenses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Treasurer.]\r\n\r\nSister Marshal, you will conduct our sister to her station in the\r\nNorth-East.\r\n\r\n_I. O._ Sister Marshal, you will present the Conductress and Associate\r\nConductress elect.\r\n\r\n_M._ Worthy ----, I have the pleasure of presenting Sister ----, elected\r\nto be Conductress, and Sister ----, elected to be Associate Conductress\r\nof this Chapter for the ensuing year.\r\n\r\n_I. O._ My sisters, upon you devolves the duty of preparing and\r\nconducting through our ceremonies of initiation those who seek the\r\nprivileges of our Order. It is important, therefore, that you should\r\nfully understand and intelligently perform the duties of your office.\r\nThe candidates enter our Chapter prepared to receive a favorable\r\nimpression of our mysteries and aims; if you present these matters\r\naright, throwing sisterly courtesy and dignity around your official\r\nproceedings, they will acquire a fond regard for our beautiful Order.\r\nRemember, therefore, that it depends greatly upon the manner in which\r\nyou perform your duties whether the candidates receive favorable\r\nimpressions from their initiation.\r\n\r\nSister Marshal, you will invest our sisters with their badges of office.\r\n\r\nSister Conductress, your badge is the Scroll and Baton within the Star,\r\nan emblem of prepared plans and their fulfillment, admonishing you that\r\nthe first impressions made upon candidates are permanent, and should be\r\nfor good.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Conductress.]\r\n\r\nSister Associate Conductress, your badge is the Baton within the Star,\r\nan emblem of direction, admonishing you that good discipline is\r\nessential to the success of our Order.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Assoc. Conductress.]\r\n\r\nSister Marshal, you will conduct our sisters to their stations in the\r\nSouth and North.\r\n\r\n_I. O._ Sister Marshal, you will present the Chaplain elect.\r\n\r\n_M._ Worthy ----, I have the pleasure of presenting ---- ----, who has\r\nbeen appointed Chaplain for the ensuing year.\r\n\r\n_I. O._ My ----, we recognize our dependence upon the Source of all\r\nWisdom and Strength, and often invoke the blessing of our Heavenly\r\nFather upon our work. It will be your duty to lead the Chapter in its\r\ndevotions at the altar, and perform such other duties as are appropriate\r\nto your office.\r\n\r\nSister Marshal, you will invest our ---- with the badge of his office.\r\n\r\nYour badge is the Bible within the Star, a symbol of the word of God,\r\nadmonishing you to walk circumspectly, that your life may be void of\r\noffense toward God and man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chaplain.]\r\n\r\nSister Marshal, you will conduct our ---- to ---- station in the East,\r\nat the right of the Worthy Matron.\r\n\r\n_I. O._ Sister Marshal, you will present the Marshal elect.\r\n\r\n_M._ Worthy ----, I have the pleasure of presenting Sister ----, who has\r\nbeen appointed Marshal for the ensuing year.\r\n\r\n_I. O._ My sister, the position assigned you is one of honor and\r\nresponsibility. It is your duty to superintend and marshal all\r\nprocessions, assist in all its public and private ceremonies, conduct\r\nand proclaim the officers at the time of their installation, and perform\r\nsuch other duties as pertain to your office.\r\n\r\nSister Marshal, you will invest our sister with the badge of her office.\r\n\r\nYour badge is the Cross Batons within the Star, an emblem of direction,\r\nadmonishing you that courtesy and promptness are essential to the\r\ndischarge of your duties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Marshal.]\r\n\r\nSister Marshal, you will conduct our sister to her station in the\r\nSouth-East.\r\n\r\n_I.

Sister ----,\r\nto represent the blue ray of Adah; Sister ----, the yellow ray of Ruth;\r\nSister ----, the white ray of Esther; Sister ----, the green ray of\r\nMartha; and Sister ----, the red ray of Electa.\r\n\r\n    In the installation of the Star officers, bouquets of flowers,\r\n    having the appropriate colors for the several points, may be\r\n    introduced with pleasing effect.\r\n\r\n_I. O._ My sisters, you are the floral center of this Chapter. In our\r\nceremonies, the colors and flowers appropriate to the five points of our\r\nStar are endowed with beauty and instruction. To you is assigned the\r\nduty of teaching the impressive lessons which those colors and floral\r\nemblems symbolize, and the sublime virtues illustrated in the lives of\r\nthe heroines of our Order. How important, then, that in the discharge of\r\nyour official duties, you should strive to throw an air of beauty and\r\nsolemnity around all that you have to say and do, so that from you, as\r\nthe central Star of this Chapter, may emanate a light that will give\r\ninstruction and joy to all who attend our meetings.\r\n\r\nSister Marshal, you will invest our sisters with their badges of office.\r\n\r\n_I. O._ Sister Adah, your badge is the Sword and Veil within the\r\nTriangle, an emblem of the heroic conduct of Jephthah's Daughter,\r\nadmonishing you to be ever faithful to your convictions of right and\r\nduty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Adah.]\r\n\r\nSister Ruth, your badge is the Sheaf within the Triangle, an emblem of\r\nplenty, admonishing you that patient industry shall not go unrewarded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ruth.]\r\n\r\nSister Esther, your badge is the Crown and Scepter within the Triangle,\r\nan emblem of royalty and power, admonishing you to emulate the virtues\r\nof the heroic queen Esther.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Esther.]\r\n\r\nSister Martha, your badge is the Broken Column within the Triangle, an\r\nemblem of the uncertainty of human life, admonishing you that the\r\ndeepest sorrow is often relieved by trustful faith in God.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Martha.]\r\n\r\nSister Electa, your badge is the Cup within the Triangle, an emblem of\r\ncharity and hospitality, virtues inculcated by the teachings of our\r\nOrder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Electa.]\r\n\r\nSuch, my sisters, are some of the lessons taught by your several badges\r\nof office.\r\n\r\nThe sublime virtues exemplified in the lives of the distinguished\r\nheroines whom you represent, are worthy of imitation, and I trust that\r\nwhile you teach those virtues to others, they will be illustrated in\r\nyour lives. Thus you may honor the positions to which you have been\r\nappointed, and lay up for yourselves those Heavenly treasures which\r\nshall never fade and which will render you \"Fairest among thousands,\r\naltogether lovely.\"\r\n\r\nSister Marshal, you will conduct our sisters to their several stations.\r\n\r\n_I.

O._ My sister and brother, you are respectively the inner and outer\r\nguards of the Chapter. Upon you, therefore, we rely to preserve that\r\nsecrecy which is essential to our proceedings, and to see that the\r\nsolemnity of our ceremonies is not interrupted by untimely alarms. Be\r\never watchful in your positions, and allow none to enter or leave the\r\nChapter without permission of the presiding officer.\r\n\r\nSister Marshal, you will invest our sister and brother with their badges\r\nof office.\r\n\r\nSister Warder, your badge is the Dove within the Star, an emblem of\r\npeace, admonishing you that peace and harmony are necessary to the\r\nsuccess of our Order.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Warder.]\r\n\r\nBrother Sentinel, your badge is the Cross-swords within the Star, an\r\nemblem of protection, admonishing you that upon your watchful care\r\ndepends our security from interruption.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sentinel.]\r\n\r\nSister Marshal, you will conduct our sister and brother to their\r\nstations within and without the door.\r\n\r\n_I. O._ Sister Marshal, you will present the Organist elect.\r\n\r\n_M._ Worthy ----, I have the pleasure of presenting Sister ----, who has\r\nbeen appointed Organist for the ensuing year.\r\n\r\n_I. O._ My sister, your duties are embodied in the name of your office.\r\nTo make the initiation ceremonies as impressive and effective as we\r\ndesire, it is important that you should be faithful to your trust.\r\n\r\nSister Marshal, you will invest our sister with the badge of her office.\r\n\r\nYour badge is the Lyre within the Star, an emblem of music and poetry,\r\nadmonishing you that by uniting harmony with our mystic rites, the\r\nimpressions will be more lasting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Organist.]\r\n\r\nSister Marshal, you will conduct our sister to her station.\r\n\r\n_I. O._ Sisters and Brothers, such is the nature of all associations,\r\nthat some must rule and govern, and others submit and obey.\r\n\r\nThe officers whom you have selected to preside over your deliberations\r\nduring the ensuing year, are, I trust, sufficiently conversant with the\r\nrules of our Order to avoid exceeding the powers with which you have\r\nintrusted them.\r\n\r\nAll things are now ready for you to enter upon the proceedings of a new\r\nyear. But we know not what is before us. No one can affirm that another\r\nyear, or even a single day, will be committed to our trust. Therefore,\r\nif we have been faithful heretofore, let us increase our exertions for\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nAs among the objects for which we are associated together is our purpose\r\nto protect the widow and orphan, comfort the afflicted, sympathize with\r\nthe sorrowing, and relieve the destitute and distressed, I trust that no\r\ndiscord will ever rise among us to imperil the success of our efforts to\r\naccomplish these charitable purposes, and increase the happiness of\r\nourselves and others.\r\n\r\nLet us be kind, forbearing and forgiving, one towards another. Let us\r\nreturn kindness for hostility. Let us sacredly preserve our lips from\r\nslander and evil speaking; and whatever may be our failings, let us\r\nthrow around each other the broad mantle of charity. And, finally, let\r\nus be governed in words and deeds by the golden rule, \"Whatsoever ye\r\nwould that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the\r\nlaw and the prophets.\"\r\n\r\nThus may we confidently hope that in the good providence of God, each of\r\nus will be brought, through a useful and happy life, to a blissful\r\nclose, and triumphant entrance upon the joys of celestial life.\r\n\r\n    The Installing Officer then addresses the Worthy Matron, who, as he\r\n    does so, rises.\r\n\r\nWorthy Matron, the officers of your Chapter have been installed into\r\ntheir respective stations, and are prepared to enter upon their duties.\r\nYou will now receive in charge the Charter, by the authority of which\r\nthis Chapter is held, and which must be present at all its meetings. You\r\nwill also receive the Constitution governing the Order in this State,\r\nand the By-laws of this Chapter, both of which you are expected to make\r\nyourself thoroughly acquainted with, and see promptly obeyed. I now\r\npresent to you the Gavel, an emblem of your authority; and as none\r\nshould disobey it, I confidently hope that you will never use it in an\r\narbitrary or dictatorial manner, remembering that we should charitably\r\ntemper justice with mercy. You will now assume your station as the\r\nWorthy Matron of this Chapter.\r\n\r\n    The Worthy Matron steps to the center of the dais, and the\r\n    Installing Officer to the right. The Worthy Matron calls up the\r\n    Chapter.\r\n\r\n_I. O._ Sister Marshal, you will now proclaim the officers of ----\r\nChapter No. --, regularly installed.\r\n\r\n_M._ In the name of the Grand Chapter and by order of the Worthy ----, I\r\nproclaim the officers of ---- Chapter No. --, of the Order of the\r\nEastern Star, for the ensuing year, regularly installed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        CEREMONY OF INSTALLATION\r\n                      Officers of Grand Chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Grand Chapter being properly opened, as for work, a Past Grand\r\n    Patron or Grand Matron presiding; if none such be present, then the\r\n    oldest member being a Past Patron shall take the chair, and, with\r\n    such assistance as he may appoint, the ceremony shall proceed, as\r\n    follows:\r\n\r\n    The Grand Secretary shall call the list of officers, elected and\r\n    appointed; and, as their names are called, they will form a\r\n    semi-circle on the west side of the Altar, facing the East, to\r\n    receive the Obligation; the emblems of office and jewels having been\r\n    collected at the East; the Worthy Grand Matron on the extreme South,\r\n    followed by the Worthy Grand Patron, &c.\r\n\r\n    [This ceremony may be used to install the officers of the General\r\n    Grand Chapter, by prefixing the words, \"Most Worthy\" to Grand Matron\r\n    and Grand Patron, \"Right Worthy\" to the Associate Grand Matron,\r\n    Associate Grand Patron, Grand Secretary and Grand Treasurer, and\r\n    \"Very Worthy\" to Grand Chaplain, and \"Worthy\" before the rest of the\r\n    Grand Officers. Whenever \"Grand Chapter\" occurs, prefix the word\r\n    \"General.\"]\r\n\r\n    The Grand Marshal will then present the officers to the Grand Matron\r\n    or Grand Patron.\r\n\r\n_G. M._ Grand ----, I have the pleasure to present to you, for\r\ninstallation, these sisters and brothers, who have been duly elected and\r\nchosen to preside over us and assist in conducting the business of this\r\nGrand Chapter, and to discharge all other duties appertaining to their\r\nseveral stations until their successors are lawfully chosen and\r\ninstalled.\r\n\r\n    Installing Officer rises and calls up the Grand Chapter, which is\r\n    addressed as follows:\r\n\r\n_Grand ----._ Sisters and brothers of the Grand Chapter, these persons,\r\nselected by you, are now ready and willing to take upon themselves the\r\nobligations, duties and responsibilities of office. In our beautiful\r\nOrder, preferment to office should not be sought after, but should come\r\nto the individual chosen, as an honor justly merited and freely\r\nbestowed. Those only should be chosen, who, by their reputation, their\r\nwork, and high moral character, command the esteem and confidence of our\r\nmembers, and can give us standing and credit before the world. Do you\r\nbelieve they possess these qualifications, and now desire that they\r\nshall be installed into the offices to which they have been chosen?\r\n\r\n    The Grand Chapter responds:\r\n\r\nWe do.\r\n\r\n    Installing Officer continues:\r\n\r\n_Grand ----._ Sisters and brothers-elect, there being no objection\r\nagainst either of you, gives us full assurance of your competency to\r\ndischarge the responsible duties to be assigned you. You have been\r\nchosen to take charge of the affairs of this Grand Chapter for the\r\nensuing year.\r\n\r\nIt is no small mark of esteem to be thus selected; let it be your aim to\r\nmake the ensuing year the most prosperous in the history of this Grand\r\nChapter; then you will find in the record of its prosperity the reward\r\nof your faithful service.\r\n\r\nYou will please give your assent to the obligation of office.\r\n\r\nDo you each sacredly promise to support, maintain and enforce the\r\nConstitution, By-Laws, and Regulations of this Grand Chapter, be\r\nobedient to its orders and directions, and, to the best of your\r\nknowledge and ability, impartially and faithfully discharge the duties\r\nof your office, and use your utmost endeavors to make yourself useful,\r\nand your station honorable, in the office with which I am now about to\r\ninvest you?\r\n\r\n    They severally assent, and the Installing Officer will then seat the\r\n    Grand Chapter, the officers elect being seated together, and the\r\n    ceremonies will proceed, as follows:\r\n\r\n_G. M._ Grand ----, I have the honor to present, for installation,\r\nSister ----, duly elected Grand Matron for the ensuing year. Our sister\r\nis fully aware of the great responsibility she is assuming, in the\r\nacceptance of this important position, yet she is willing to undertake\r\nit, in the belief that, with the aid and assistance of the sisters and\r\nbrothers, and by the help of God, she will not fail in the performance\r\nof her duty, and thus prove that the confidence reposed in her has not\r\nbeen misapplied.\r\n\r\n_Grand ----._ Sister ----, you have been elected by the free ballot of\r\nthe members of this Grand Chapter, to occupy the most exalted position\r\nin their power to bestow upon a sister; a just and deserving tribute to\r\nyour zeal and worth, and I congratulate you upon your preferment.\r\n\r\nThe high honors attached to the office of Grand Matron are accompanied\r\nby weighty and delicate responsibilities. It is expected that you will\r\nhave a watchful care over the interests of this Grand Chapter, see that\r\nits Constitutions, By-Laws and Regulations, orders and edicts are\r\npromptly enforced throughout this jurisdiction, that subordinate\r\nofficers discharge their duties, and that, by your own respect for law\r\nand good government, you will cause all others to find the strongest\r\nincentive of obedience to all lawful commands.\r\n\r\nYour duties are more specifically set forth in the Constitution, to\r\nwhich I refer you, with the admonition: Be cautious in your words,\r\ncourteous in your actions, sincere in your rulings, governing with\r\nmoderation and decorum, trusting that your well-known zeal in the cause\r\nof the Order will lead you to discharge these important trusts with\r\nlasting benefit to this Grand Chapter and great credit to yourself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Grand Matron.]\r\n\r\nYou will now be invested with the proper badge of office, and be\r\nconducted to your station in the East.\r\n\r\n    After she is in her station, the Installing officer will call up the\r\n    Grand Chapter, and say:\r\n\r\n_Grand ----._ Grand Matron, behold your sisters and brothers! Sisters\r\nand brothers, behold your Grand Matron, and salute her with the Grand\r\nHonors.\r\n\r\n    Seats the Grand Chapter.\r\n\r\n_G. M._ Grand ----, it is with pleasure I introduce to you Brother ----,\r\nwho has been duly elected Grand Patron for the ensuing year. I doubt not\r\nbut you will find him as willing to discharge the duties as to enjoy the\r\nhigh honors conferred upon him.\r\n\r\n_Grand ----._ Brother ----, you have been elected by the free choice of\r\nthe members of this Grand Chapter to occupy the most exalted position in\r\ntheir power to bestow upon a brother; a just compliment to your zeal and\r\nworth, and for which I offer you my sincere congratulations. Your\r\nintimate acquaintance with the rules and affairs of our Order justify me\r\nin saying that the members have exercised a sound discretion in this\r\nselection. You are elevated to a position from which the power and\r\nprerogative may depart with the expiration of your term of service, but\r\nthe honor and dignity, except by your own act, _never_!\r\n\r\nYour duties are to issue dispensations, organize and supervise new\r\nChapters, and assist the Grand Matron in the discharge of her duties.\r\nOther duties appropriate to your high office might be named, which will\r\nreadily suggest themselves to a sensitive mind, imbued with a proper\r\nzeal to promote the interests of our Order. The field is broad, and\r\nwhitening for the harvest; may you be the instrument of gathering many\r\nsheaves to our garner, that it may be said of you, \"Well done, thou good\r\nand faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will\r\nmake thee ruler over many things.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Grand Patron.]\r\n\r\nYou will now be invested with the insignia of office, and be conducted\r\nto your station on the left of the Grand Matron in the East.\r\n\r\n    After he is in his station, the Installing Officer will call up the\r\n    Grand Chapter, and say:\r\n\r\n_Grand ----._ Grand Patron, behold your sisters and brothers! Sisters\r\nand brothers, behold your Grand Patron, and salute him with the Grand\r\nHonors.\r\n\r\n    Seats the Grand Chapter.\r\n\r\n_G. M._ Grand ----, with pleasure I present Sister ----, elected\r\nAssociate Grand Matron, for installation. I am persuaded she fully\r\nappreciates the honor conferred, and will discharge the duties imposed\r\nwith credit to herself and satisfaction to the Order.\r\n\r\n_Grand ----._ Sister ----, the duties of your honorable station are\r\nembodied in the name of your office. You are to assist the Grand Matron,\r\nand in case of her death, absence, or disability, you shall act for her\r\nand discharge her duties. To you is especially intrusted the supervision\r\nof your sister officers, that the paraphernalia of the Grand Chapter be\r\nproperly preserved, and its Ritual ceremonies performed intelligently.\r\nBe ever ready to discharge these duties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Asso. Grand Matron.]\r\n\r\nYou will now be invested with your badge of office, and conducted to\r\nyour station in the West.\r\n\r\n_G. M._ Grand ----, I now have the pleasure of presenting to you, for\r\ninstallation, Brother ----, who has been duly elected Associate Grand\r\nPatron.\r\n\r\n_Grand ----._ Brother ----, I congratulate you on being chosen to fill\r\nso high a station. Your duties are to assist the Grand Patron, and in\r\ncase of his death, absence or disability, to assume his powers and\r\nduties. Those who have reposed so much confidence in you have reason to\r\nexpect you to faithfully look after their interests, and zealously work\r\nfor the welfare of the Order. Let the laws, tenets and professions of\r\nthe Eastern Star be your constant study, that you may be ready to\r\nenforce them by precept and example, and the better enabled to exercise\r\nthe higher and more exalted position to which you may be called at any\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Associate Grand Patron.]\r\n\r\nYou will now be invested with the proper emblem of office, and conducted\r\nto your station on the left of the Associate Grand Matron, in the West.\r\n\r\n_G. M._ Grand ----, it is my pleasant duty to introduce ---- ----, duly\r\nelected to serve us as Grand Secretary for the ensuing year.\r\n\r\n_Grand ----._ ---- ----, the office to which you have been elected is by\r\nfar the most important, if not the most honorable, within the gift of\r\nthis Grand Chapter. Yours is an onerous and most responsible charge. But\r\nfew are competent to perform it in the thorough manner it demands.\r\nFailure or neglect upon your part will complicate and embarrass all our\r\nproceedings, and give us a disgraceful record before the world. To you,\r\nalso, is intrusted the collection of all funds due the Grand Chapter,\r\nthe custody of the seal, records, books, and papers. You are the\r\ncorrespondent and financial agent of the Grand Chapter, the medium of\r\nintercourse between the officers and members thereof, as well as between\r\nthem and Subordinate Chapters. The faithful discharge of all your\r\nvarious duties requires constant and systematic work, a careful keeping\r\nof records and accounts, prompt and discreet action, and the highest\r\nintegrity of character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Grand Secretary.]\r\n\r\nYou will now receive your emblem of office, and be conducted to your\r\nstation in the South-East.\r\n\r\n_G. M._ Grand ----, it is with confidence and pleasure I present to you,\r\nfor installation, Sister ----, duly elected to serve as Grand Treasurer\r\nfor the ensuing year.\r\n\r\n_Grand ----._ Sister ----, to you is intrusted the proper care,\r\npreservation and disbursement of the funds of this Grand Chapter. This\r\nis a trust of the utmost importance, for without money little good can\r\nbe accomplished. You will, therefore, attend carefully to the financial\r\ninterests of the Order, receiving the funds, through the Grand\r\nSecretary, from the different sources of revenue, keep them safely\r\ninvested, render a just account thereof, and pay the same out only on\r\nproper vouchers, with the consent of this Grand Chapter. Let it be your\r\nconstant care to be faithful to your trust, and not forfeit the\r\nconfidence reposed in you by this Grand Chapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Grand Treasurer.]\r\n\r\nYou will now receive your badge of office, and be conducted to your\r\nstation, in the North-East.\r\n\r\n_G. M._ Grand ----, I have the honor to present ---- ----, chosen to\r\nofficiate as Grand Chaplain for the ensuing year.\r\n\r\n_Grand ----._ My ----, our beautiful Order founded upon the moral\r\nteachings of the Holy Scripture, everywhere, and on all occasions,\r\nacknowledges the existence and providence of God. Except the Lord build\r\nthe house, they labor in vain that build it; except the Lord keep the\r\ncity, the watchman waketh in vain. You have been chosen Grand Chaplain,\r\nand as such it will be your duty to conduct the devotional exercises of\r\nthis Grand Chapter, and superintend and promote its charitable and\r\nbenevolent objects. These will afford a wide field of usefulness, and\r\nmay you be so successful in pointing to the \"Star in the East\" that all\r\nwill be induced to follow it, until they meet in the Grand Chapter\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Grand Chaplain.]\r\n\r\nYou will now be invested with your badge of office, and take your\r\nstation on the right of the Grand Matron.\r\n\r\n_G. M._ Grand ----, it is with pleasure I present ---- ----, appointed\r\nGrand Lecturer.\r\n\r\n_Grand ----._ ---- ----, to you is intrusted the work of the Order, its\r\nrites, traditions, and ceremonies, and it will be your duty to exemplify\r\nthe same, whenever called upon by this Grand Chapter, and see that they\r\nare intelligently performed by the subordinate Chapters of this\r\njurisdiction. To discharge these duties well, will require much time,\r\nstudy and observation upon your part; but we trust that your attachment\r\nto the principles of our Order, and zeal in promoting its interests,\r\nwill lead you to the faithful discharge of your duties.\r\n\r\nReceive the jewel and emblem of your office, and take your station in\r\nthe South.\r\n\r\n_G. M._ Grand ----, I now have the pleasure of presenting ---- ----, for\r\ninstallation, as Grand Marshal.\r\n\r\n_Grand ----._ ---- ----, the post assigned to you is one of honor and\r\nresponsibility. It is your duty to superintend and marshal all\r\nprocessions of the Grand Chapter, assist in all its public and private\r\nceremonies, conduct and proclaim the officers at the time of\r\ninstallation, and perform such other duties as pertain to your office.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Grand Marshal.]\r\n\r\nYou will now be invested with the badge of your office, and be conducted\r\nto your station in the South-East.\r\n\r\n_G. M._ Grand ----, I have the pleasure to introduce, for installation,\r\nSister ----, appointed Grand Conductress, and Sister ----, appointed\r\nAssociate Grand Conductress for the ensuing year.\r\n\r\n_Grand ----._ My sisters, your duties are to attend upon your superior\r\nofficers, assist in the active duties of this Grand Chapter, introduce\r\nand welcome visitors, and aid in exemplifying the rites and ceremonies\r\nof our Order upon all proper occasions.\r\n\r\nIf you attend to these duties aright, throwing sisterly courtesy and\r\ndignity around your official conduct, you will acquire the confidence\r\nand respect of all and merit promotion to still higher honors and more\r\nweighty responsibilities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Grand Conductress.]\r\n\r\nYou will now receive your respective badges of office, and be conducted\r\nto your proper stations in the South and North.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Assoc. Grand Conductress.]\r\n\r\n_G. M._ Grand ----, it is with pleasure that I present to you, for\r\ninstallation, these sisters who have been appointed to represent the\r\nfive distinguished heroines of our Order, Sister ----, as Grand Adah;\r\nSister ----, as Grand Ruth; Sister ----, as Grand Esther; Sister ----,\r\nas Grand Martha; Sister ----, as Grand Electa.\r\n\r\n_Grand ----._ My sisters, the most important lessons of our Order are\r\ngiven from the five points of our emblematic Star. It should be your\r\nstudy to most impressively render these lessons during the opening\r\nceremonies of this Grand Chapter, and whenever your services may be\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nYou will now each be invested with the badge of your office, and\r\nconducted to your stations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Grand Officers.]\r\n\r\n_G. M._ It is with pleasure that I present, for installation, Sister\r\n----, appointed to be Grand Warder, and Brother ----, appointed to be\r\nGrand Sentinel.\r\n\r\n_Grand ----._ My sister and brother, you are, respectively, the inner\r\nand outer guards of the Grand Chapter. Upon you, therefore, we rely to\r\npreserve that secrecy which is essential to our proceedings, and to see\r\nthat our ceremonies are not interrupted by untimely alarms, and to\r\ndischarge such other duties as appertain to your office. A prompt and\r\nfaithful discharge of these responsibilities will afford the best\r\nevidence of your attachment for the tenets and professions of our Order.\r\n\r\nYou will be invested with your respective badges of office, and\r\nconducted to your stations within and without the door of the Grand\r\nChapter.\r\n\r\n_G. M._ It is my pleasant duty to present for installation, Sister ----,\r\nappointed to serve as Grand Organist for the ensuing year.\r\n\r\n_Grand ----._ My sister, your duties are embodied in the name of your\r\noffice, admonishing you that by uniting music and harmony with our\r\nmystic lessons the ceremonials of our Order will prove more lasting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Grand Organist.]\r\n\r\nYou will be invested with your badge of office, and conducted to your\r\nstation.\r\n\r\n_G. M._ Grand ----, my duties are ended. The several officers of this\r\nGrand Chapter have been duly elected, installed, invested with their\r\nbadges of office, and conducted to their respective stations.\r\n\r\n_Grand ----._ It is well. Officers and members of the Grand Chapter, all\r\nthings are now ready for you to enter upon the proceedings of a new\r\nyear. Harmony and good-will prevail, and we start under the most\r\nauspicious circumstances. But no one can affirm that another year, or\r\neven a single day, will be committed to our trust. Therefore, if we have\r\nbeen faithful heretofore, let us redouble our exertions for the future.\r\nLet us continue kindly affectionate, one toward another. Let us walk\r\ncircumspectly, sacredly preserving our lips from slander and evil\r\nspeaking, ever remembering our sacred obligations. And may we, each of\r\nus, through the good providence of God, be brought, through a useful and\r\nhappy life, to a blissful close and a triumphant entrance upon the joys\r\nof the Heavenly life.\r\n\r\nLet us now look to God for his benediction.\r\n\r\n    Installing Officer calls up the Grand Chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Grand ----._ Grand Marshal, you will proclaim the Grand Officers,\r\nregularly installed.\r\n\r\n_G. M._ In the name of the Grand Chapter and by order of the Worthy\r\nGrand ----, I proclaim the officers of the Grand Chapter of ----, Order\r\nof the Eastern Star, duly installed.\r\n\r\n    Seats the Grand Chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          Funeral Ceremonies of the Order of the Eastern Star\r\n\r\n    At the burial of a sister, the badges of the members and officers\r\n    should be draped with crape. A floral five-pointed Star should be\r\n    provided, having flowers of the appropriate colors for the several\r\n    points. The Star officers should each have a small bouquet, or a few\r\n    loose flowers of the appropriate color. A few flowers should also be\r\n    provided for the Worthy Matron and Worthy Patron.\r\n\r\n    The floral Star may be deposited with the casket, or be retained by\r\n    the family of the deceased.\r\n\r\n    This service, although primarily designed for use at the Grave, can,\r\n    if it is thought best to do so, be performed within the Chapter\r\n    room, the Church, or other appropriate place. The members may meet\r\n    at the Chapter room, or at the place of service.\r\n\r\n    A member will be appointed to act as Marshal, who will see that the\r\n    badges are properly draped, and that the officers and members are in\r\n    their proper positions.\r\n\r\n    If a procession is formed, it will march in the following order:\r\n    Marshal and Sentinel, Members, Warder and Electa, Martha and Esther,\r\n    Ruth and Adah, Conductress and Associate Conductress, Secretary and\r\n    Treasurer, Matron and Associate Matron, Patron and Chaplain.\r\n\r\n    During the services, the officers and members will occupy the\r\n    following positions around the grave or casket:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Funeral Positions.]\r\n\r\n    When all is ready, the services should commence with a short strain\r\n    of solemn music, \"The Lord is my Shepherd,\" etc. After which the\r\n    Worthy Patron will say:\r\n\r\n_W. P._ Sisters and Brothers, we have gathered at this solemn hour to\r\nperform those final rites which affection has prescribed for our\r\ndeparted sister. She, who was with us but yesterday, has been summoned\r\nhence by a messenger who cometh sooner or later for us all.\r\n\r\nHow appropriately may we gather around her remains, and together pay\r\nlove's tribute to her memory.\r\n\r\nShe has indeed passed beyond the reach of praise, or the touch of\r\ncensure. It is not, therefore, to her that we tender this our heart's\r\nsaddest offering.\r\n\r\nWe are here in acknowledgment of sacred ties now severed, of memories\r\ntenderly cherished, and hearts touched with sympathy for loved ones\r\nbereaved.\r\n\r\nOur sister has finished her allotted task in the conflict of life. The\r\nchapter of her earthly sojourn is closed, but her many virtues shall not\r\ngo unrecorded.\r\n\r\nFor a time we have walked with her in the pilgrimage of life, and around\r\nthe same altar we have learned the lessons of our Order.\r\n\r\nAs she was faithful to her convictions of right, as she was obedient to\r\nthe demands of honor and justice in her station; as she loved kindred\r\nand friends, and in affliction evinced a trustful faith; and as she\r\nlived in the spirit of charity and the love of truth, so shall be her\r\nreward.\r\n\r\nRemembering her many virtues, we are indeed mourners at her grave, and\r\nin the house of sorrow we would drop the tear of affectionate sympathy.\r\n\r\nSisters, brothers, and friends, as we stand in this solemn presence we\r\nmay hear the voice of this Providence speaking to us.\r\n\r\nNot long shall we wait ere we obey the inexorable decree of Death, and\r\nfollow our sister.\r\n\r\nHow brief and full of mystery is human life! Who can fathom its purpose,\r\nor disclose its issues. We entered life as it were but yesterday; to-day\r\nwe perform our allotted task, and to-morrow we go--who knows whither? We\r\nstrain our eyes in vain endeavor to scan with mortal vision the infinite\r\nshore. But, thanks to our Heavenly Father, who gives fruition to His\r\nchildren's hopes, He bids us look yet again.\r\n\r\nStanding beside the Broken Column, we may, with Martha's trustful faith,\r\nlook beyond the shore of time, and know that our sister, though lost to\r\nmortal vision, is only waiting beyond the river to welcome us to our\r\neternal home.\r\n\r\n\"In my Father's house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have\r\ntold you, I go to prepare a place for you, that where I am there ye may\r\nbe also.\" O, let the comforting assurance come to us, \"That if our\r\nearthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of\r\nGod, a house not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens.\"\r\n\r\nInstructed by this Providence, may we go from this place of mourning,\r\nand this hour of reflection, with the inspiration of a new hope, and\r\nearnest purpose.\r\n\r\n    \"So live, that when thy summons comes to join\r\n    The innumerable caravan that moves\r\n    To the pale realms of shade, where each shall take\r\n    His chamber in the silent halls of death,\r\n    Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,\r\n    Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed\r\n    By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave\r\n    Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch\r\n    About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                SINGING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following or some other appropriate hymn may be used:\r\n\r\n      Friend after friend departs;\r\n      Who hath not lost a friend?\r\n    There is no union here of hearts,\r\n      That finds not here an end.\r\n    Were this frail world our only rest,\r\n    Living or dying, none were blest.\r\n\r\n      There is a world above,\r\n      Where parting is unknown--\r\n    A whole eternity of love\r\n      And blessedness alone;\r\n    And faith beholds the dying here,\r\n    Translated to that happier sphere.\r\n\r\n_W. P._ The examples and symbols of our Order are full of useful and\r\nimpressive lessons. They speak to us in this solemn hour with unwonted\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\nThese floral tributes, the offering of sisterly affection, echo voices\r\noften heard from the several points of our Star; they symbolize, in the\r\nritual of our Order, virtues which should adorn our lives. How\r\nappropriately, then, may they bear an important part in this solemn\r\nceremonial.\r\n\r\nSisters of our Star, you who represent the five distinguished heroines\r\nof our Order, have you anything to offer ere we leave the grave of our\r\ndeparted sister?\r\n\r\nSister Adah, what is the voice and tribute from the Blue point of our\r\nemblematic Star?\r\n\r\n_Adah._ Blue symbolizes fidelity, and is appropriate to Jephthah's\r\nDaughter, who, in the morning of life, surrendered to the grave the\r\nbrightest of earthly hopes, that she might be faithful to her\r\nconvictions of right, and preserve her father's honor. As a token of\r\nfaithfulness to the memory of our sister, I deposit in her grave this\r\ntribute of faithful love.\r\n\r\n    At the proper time each officer will drop into the grave, or place\r\n    upon the casket, the flowers provided for that purpose.\r\n\r\n    Adah deposits her tribute, and then, addressing Ruth, says:\r\n\r\nSister Ruth, what is the voice and tribute from the Yellow point of our\r\nStar?\r\n\r\n_Ruth._ Yellow symbolizes constancy, teaching faithful obedience to the\r\ndemands of honor and justice. Ruth exemplified these virtues in humble\r\nstation, and sought the society of the good and true. In token of\r\nappreciation of these virtues, I deposit in the grave of our sister this\r\nfloral tribute.\r\n\r\n    Deposits her tribute, and then, addressing Esther, says:\r\n\r\nSister Esther, what is the voice and tribute from the White point of our\r\nStar?\r\n\r\n_Esther._ White symbolizes light and purity. The heroic Queen Esther\r\nevinced the purity of her motive and love of kindred and friends, by her\r\nwillingness to risk the loss of crown and life, to save her people from\r\ndeath. In token of sincere affection for our sister, I deposit in her\r\ngrave this emblem of light and purity.\r\n\r\n    Deposits her tribute, and then, addressing Martha, says:\r\n\r\nSister Martha, what is the voice and tribute from the Green point of our\r\nStar?\r\n\r\n_Martha._ Green is an emblem of Nature's life and beauty. The evergreen\r\nis a symbol of immortal life, and teaches us, that in the economy of God\r\nthere is no death; forms change, but the spirit survives. Martha, beside\r\nthe grave of her beloved brother, avowed her trustful faith and hope of\r\nimmortal life. In the full assurance of our sister's entrance upon a\r\nglorious immortality, I deposit in her grave this evergreen.\r\n\r\n    Deposits her tribute, and then, addressing Electa, says:\r\n\r\nSister Electa, what is the voice and tribute from the Red point of our\r\nStar?\r\n\r\n_Electa._ Red symbolizes fervency and zeal. Electa represents those who\r\nhave been pre-eminent in charity, and heroic in endurance of the wrongs\r\nof persecution. In token of the fervency of our affection for our\r\nsister, I deposit in her grave this tribute of love.\r\n\r\n    Deposits her tribute, and then, addressing the Worthy Matron, says:\r\n\r\nWorthy Matron, we have spoken from the five points of our emblematic\r\nStar, but our departed sister hears us not. Is it in vain that we speak\r\nto the living?\r\n\r\n_W. M._ You have spoken well, my sisters. It is not in vain that we hear\r\nthe oft repeated lessons of our Star. It is true that our sister hears\r\nnot with mortal ear the lessons she was wont to learn from you; but is\r\nit true that she listens not to our words of love, and sees not the\r\nbeautiful tributes strewn within her grave? May not her quickened\r\nspirit, freed from its earthly tenement, yet hover around the loved ones\r\nhere assembled, listen to our words, and perceive with clearer vision\r\nour every movement?\r\n\r\nShe needs not to be ministered unto; but may she not now minister to us?\r\n\"Are they not all ministering spirits?\" saith the apostle.\r\n\r\nLove is an attribute of the soul, and imperishable. Our sister's\r\naffection ceases not; therefore may she not now be whispering to\r\ngrief-stricken hearts, \"Peace be still,\" \"Lo, I am with you always.\"\r\nThink not that the spirit world is distant. Our loved ones, though lost\r\nto mortal sight, may yet be with us in spiritual existence. Let their\r\nloving presence be to us a perpetual inspiration, calling us to a higher\r\nmoral and spiritual life.\r\n\r\nThese beautiful flowers are the highest expression of Nature's\r\nloveliness. We never tire of looking at their perfect and delicately\r\nvariegated tints. From time immemorial they have been endowed with\r\nexpressive language. They speak to us, \"To whisper hope whene'er our\r\nfaith grows dim.\" But these floral emblems, with all their exquisite\r\nloveliness, are but dim reflections of the glories that may be unfolded\r\nto our spiritual vision. In token of our hope that such an unfolding of\r\nspiritual life may come to us all, I scatter these flowers within the\r\ngrave of our departed sister. May we cherish her memory and emulate her\r\nvirtues.\r\n\r\n    Deposits her tribute, and then, addressing the Worthy Patron, says:\r\n\r\nWorthy Patron, within the grave, hallowed by the tenderest ties of human\r\naffection, we scatter these floral emblems of Nature's loveliness, and\r\nspiritual life. May we not trust all else to the Father's loving care?\r\n\r\n_W. P._ The Infinite Father's ever watchful care is nowhere more\r\nimpressively taught, than by His voice speaking to us through the floral\r\nkingdom. Over the whole earth where life exists, flowers bloom in\r\nendless variety and profusion, there is no place so obscure but that\r\nthey blossom there and give to the world their beauty and fragrance.\r\nSome open with the rising sun, and close with his setting rays. Others\r\nopen to the full moon and starry firmament, and shrink before the\r\npiercing gaze of the king of day.\r\n\r\nSo the Father's love goes forth by day and night, to the weakest, most\r\nhumble, and obscure of His children.\r\n\r\nWe are told to consider the lilies of the field, and learn the paternal\r\nlove of Him, beyond whose watchful care none can stray. Not a sparrow\r\nfalls without His notice. \"Ye are of more value than many sparrows.\"\r\n\r\nIn token of our trust in the all-embracing love of the Infinite Father,\r\nI deposit these emblems of His watchful care in the grave of our\r\ndeparted sister.\r\n\r\n    Drops the flowers, and continues as follows:\r\n\r\nSisters and brothers, within the city of the dead, we consign to the\r\nbosom of mother earth all that was mortal of our departed sister. The\r\nbody we leave in the grave is but the casket which held the precious\r\njewel of life. We bear it tenderly to its resting-place, because it is\r\nthe form by which we knew her in our Chapter. Peacefully let it rest in\r\nthe hallowed ground where we place it. Upon her grave flowerets will\r\nbloom amid all the countless activities of Nature's life.\r\n\r\n    \"The murmuring brook, the bird on airy wing,\r\n    And whispering pines, will here her requiem sing.\"\r\n\r\nOver her the fleeting shadows will pass. The rising sun will scatter\r\nover the chambers of the dead his gladsome rays, and tint the western\r\nsky with the glories of departing day. In the hush of night the feeble\r\nrays of countless stars, traveling centuries on their journey here, will\r\nfinally rest upon her grave.\r\n\r\nWe leave in this lowly bed the earthly form of our departed sister, and\r\nmay the hallowing influence of this providence go with us in the\r\nremaining journey of our life, and when our earthly mission is over, and\r\nwe are \"beyond the smiling and the weeping\" of earth, may we gather with\r\nthe loved ones gone before.\r\n\r\nLet us unite in prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PRAYER.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Our Father who art in Heaven, in whom we live, and in whom are all\r\n    the issues of life and death. We come to Thee, in this hour of\r\n    sorrow, and ask that we may so learn the lessons of this hour, that\r\n    when it shall be our turn to lay aside our mortality, that we may do\r\n    it with trustful faith in Thee and hope of a glorious immortality.\r\n    We pray Thee to look with tender compassion upon these Thy children,\r\n    whose household has been broken by this providence. May they lie\r\n    passive in the arms of Thy chastening love, and realize that there\r\n    is wisdom and goodness in all Thy appointments. Sanctify this\r\n    bereavement to the good of us all. May it be the means of drawing us\r\n    closer to Thee, and of our loving and serving Thee forever. And as\r\n    it has pleased Thee to call from the toils of earth the soul of our\r\n    beloved sister, we commit her remains to the silent tomb. Earth to\r\n    earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, hopefully looking to a joyful\r\n    reunion with her, in that land where separation and death are known\r\n    no more, forever. AMEN.\r\n\r\n_Response._ So may it ever be.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                SINGING.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Nearer, my God, to Thee,\r\n      Nearer to Thee!\r\n    Ev'n though it be a cross\r\n      That raiseth me!\r\n    Still all my song shall be,\r\n    Nearer, my God, to Thee,\r\n      Nearer to Thee!\r\n\r\n    Though like a wanderer,\r\n      The sun gone down,\r\n    Darkness be over me,\r\n      My rest a stone,\r\n    Yet in my dreams I'd be\r\n    Nearer, My God, to Thee,\r\n      Nearer to Thee!\r\n\r\n    Or, if on joyful wing\r\n      Cleaving the sky,\r\n    Sun, moon, and stars forgot,\r\n      Upward I fly,\r\n    Still all my song shall be,\r\n    Nearer, My God, to Thee,\r\n      Nearer to Thee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         PETITION FOR DEGREES.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _To the Worthy Matron, Officers, and Members of ......
