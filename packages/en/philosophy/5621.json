A. Naigeon, _Journal de Paris_, le 9 fev. 1789\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nDiderot, writing to the Princess Dashkoff in 1771, thus analysed the\r\nspirit of his century:\r\n\r\nChaque siècle a son esprit qui le caractérise. L'esprit du nôtre semble\r\nêtre celui de la liberté. La première attaque contre la superstition a\r\nété violente, sans mesure. Une fois que les hommes ont osé d'une manière\r\nquelconque donner l'assaut à la barrière de la religion, cette barrière\r\nla plus formidable qui existe comme la plus respectée, il est impossible\r\nde s'arrêter. Dès qu'ils ont tourné des regards menaçants contre la\r\nmajesté du ciel, ils ne manqueront pas le moment d'après de les diriger\r\ncontre la souveraineté de la terre. Le câble qui tient et comprime\r\nl'humanité est formé de deux cordes, l'une ne peut céder sans que\r\nl'autre vienne à rompre. [Endnote 1:1]\r\n\r\nThe following study proposes to deal with this attack on religion that\r\npreceded and helped to prepare the French Revolution. Similar phenomena\r\nare by no means rare in the annals of history; eighteenth-century\r\natheism, however, is of especial interest, standing as it does at the\r\nend of a long period of theological and ecclesiastical disintegration\r\nand prophesying a reconstruction of society on a purely rational and\r\nnaturalistic basis. The anti-theistic movement has been so obscured by\r\nthe less thoroughgoing tendency of deism and by subsequent romanticism\r\nthat the real issue in the eighteenth century has been largely lost from\r\nview. Hence it has seemed fit to center this study about the man who\r\nstated the situation with the most unmistakable and uncompromising\r\nclearness, and who still occupies a unique though obscure position in\r\nthe history of thought.\r\n\r\nHolbach has been very much neglected by writers on the eighteenth\r\ncentury. He has no biographer. M. Walferdin wrote (in an edition of\r\nDiderot's Works, Paris, 1821, Vol. XII p. 115): \"Nous nous occupons\r\ndepuis longtemps à rassembler les matériaux qui doivent servir à venger\r\nla mémoire du philosophe de la patrie de Leibnitz, et dans l'ouvrage\r\nque nous nous proposons de publier sous le titre \"D'Holbach jugé par\r\nses contemporains\" nous espérons faire justement apprécier ce savant\r\nsi estimable par la profondeur et la variété de ses connaissances, si\r\nprécieux à sa famille et à ses amis par la pureté et la simplicité\r\nde ses moeurs, en qui la vertu était devenue une habitude et la\r\nbienfaisance un besoin.\" This work has never appeared and M. Tourneux\r\nthinks that nothing of it was found among M. Walferdin's papers. [2:2]\r\nIn 1834 Mr. James Watson published in an English translation of the\r\n_Système de la Nature_, _A Short Sketch of the Life and the Writings\r\nof Baron d'Holbach_ by Mr. Julian Hibbert, compiled especially for\r\nthat edition from Saint Saurin's article in Michaud's _Biographie\r\nUniverselle_ (Paris, 1817, Vol. XX, pp. 460-467), from Barbier's _Dict.\r\ndes ouvrages anonymes_ (Paris, 1822) and from the preface to the Paris\r\nedition of the _Système de la Nature_ (4 vols., 18mo, 1821). This sketch\r\nwas later published separately (London, 1834, 12mo, pp. 14) but on\r\naccount of the author's sudden death it was left unfinished and is of no\r\nvalue from the point of view of scholarship. Another attempt to publish\r\nsomething on Holbach was made by Dr. Anthony C. Middleton of Boston in\r\n1857. In the preface to his translation to the _Lettres à Eugenia_\r\nhe speaks of a \"Biographical Memoir of Baron d'Holbach which I am\r\nnow preparing for the press.\" If ever published at all this _Memoir_\r\nprobably came to light in the _Boston Investigator_, a free-thinking\r\nmagazine published by Josiah P. Mendum, 45 Cornhill, Boston, but it is\r\nnot to be found. Mention should also be made of the fact that M. Assézat\r\nintended to include in a proposed study of Diderot and the philosophical\r\nmovement, a chapter to be devoted to Holbach and his society; but this\r\nwork has never appeared. [3:3]\r\n\r\nOf the two works bearing Holbach's name as a title, one is a piece of\r\nlibellous fiction by Mme. de Genlis, _Les Diners du baron d'Holbach_\r\n(Paris, 1822, 8vo), the other a romance pure and simple by F. T. Claudon\r\n(Paris, 1835, 2 vols., 8vo) called _Le Baron d'Holbach_, the events of\r\nwhich take place largely at his house and in which he plays the rôle\r\nof a minor character. A good account of Holbach, though short and\r\nincidental, is to be found in M. Avézac-Lavigne's _Diderot et la Société\r\ndu Baron d'Holbach_ (Paris, 1875, 8vo), and M. Armand Gasté has a little\r\nbook entitled _Diderot et le cure de Montchauvet, une Mystification\r\nlittéraire chez le Baron d'Holbach_ (Paris, 1895, 16vo). There are\r\nseveral works which devote a chapter or section to Holbach. [3:4] The\r\nFrench critics and the histories of philosophy contain slight notices;\r\nRosenkranz's \"Diderot's Leben\" devotes a chapter to Granval, Holbach's\r\ncountry seat, and life there as described by Diderot in his letters to\r\nMlle. Volland; and he is included in such histories of ideas as\r\nSoury, J., \"Bréviaire de l'histoire de Matérialisme\" (Paris, 1881)\r\nand Delvaille, J., _Essai sur l'histoire de l'idée de progrès_\r\n(Paris, 1910); but nowhere else is there anything more than the merest\r\nencyclopedic account, often defective and incorrect.\r\n\r\nThe sources are in a sense full and reliable for certain phases of his\r\nlife and literary activity. His own publications, numbering about fifty,\r\nform the most important body of source material for the history and\r\ndevelopment of his ideas. Next in importance are contemporary memoirs\r\nand letters including those of Voltaire, Rousseau, Diderot, Grimm,\r\nMorellet, Marmontel, Mme. d'Epinay, Naigeon, Garat, Galiani, Hume,\r\nGarrick, Wilkes, Romilly and others; and scattered letters by Holbach\r\nhimself, largely to his English friends. In addition there is a large\r\nbody of contemporary hostile criticism of his books, by Voltaire,\r\nFrederick II, Castillon, Holland, La Harpe, Delisle de Sales and a host\r\nof outraged ecclesiastics, so that one is well informed in regard to the\r\nscandal that his books caused at the time. Out of these materials\r\nand other scattered documents and notices it is possible to\r\nreconstruct--though somewhat defectively--the figure of a man who played\r\nan important rôle in his own day; but whose name has long since lost its\r\nsignificance--even in the ears of scholars. It is at the suggestion of\r\nProfessor James Harvey Robinson that this reconstruction has been made.\r\nIf it shall prove of any interest or value he must be credited with the\r\ninitiation of the idea as well as constant aid in its realization. For\r\nrendering possible the necessary investigations, recognition is due\r\nto the administration and officers of the Bibliothèque Nationale, the\r\nBritish Museum, the Library of Congress, the Libraries of Columbia and\r\nHarvard Universities, Union and Andover Theological Seminaries, and the\r\nPublic Libraries of Boston and New York.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. P. C.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK CITY,\r\n\r\nJuly, 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. HOLBACH, THE MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nPaul Heinrich Dietrich, or as he is better known, Paul-Henri Thiry,\r\nbaron d'Holbach, was born in January, 1723, in the little village of\r\nHeidelsheim (N.W. of Carlsruhe) in the Palatinate. Of his parentage and\r\nyouth nothing is known except that his father, a rich parvenu, according\r\nto Rousseau, [5:5] brought him to Paris at the age of twelve, where he\r\nreceived the greater part of his education. His father died when Holbach\r\nwas still a young man. It may be doubted if young Holbach inherited\r\nhis title and estates immediately as there was an uncle \"Messire\r\nFrancois-Adam, Baron d'Holbach, Seigneur de Héeze, Léende et autres\r\nLieux\" who lived in the rue Neuve S. Augustin and died in 1753. His\r\nfuneral was held at Saint-Roch, his parish church, Thursday, September\r\n16th, where he was afterward entombed. [5:6] Holbach was a student in\r\nthe University of Leyden in 1746 and spent a good deal of time at his\r\nuncle's estate at Héeze, a little town in the province of North Brabant\r\n(S.E. of Eindhoven). He also traveled and studied in Germany. There are\r\ntwo manuscript letters in the British Museum (Folio 30867, pp. 14, 18,\r\n20) addressed by Holbach to John Wilkes, which throw some light on his\r\nschool-days. It is interesting to note that most of Holbach's friends\r\nwere young Englishmen of whom there were some twenty-five at the\r\nUniversity of Leyden at that time. [6:7] Already at the age of\r\ntwenty-three Holbach was writing very good English, and all his life he\r\nwas a friend of Englishmen and English ideas. His friendship for Wilkes,\r\nthen a lad of nineteen, lasted all his life and increased in intimacy\r\nand dignity. The two letters following are of interest because they\r\nare the only documents we have bearing on Holbach's early manhood. They\r\nreveal a certain sympathy and feeling--rather gushing to be sure--quite\r\nunlike anything in his later writings, and quite out of line with the\r\nsupposedly cold temper of a materialist and an atheist.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: These letters, contrary to modern usage, are printed with all\r\nthe peculiarities of eighteenth century orthography. It was felt\r\nthat they would lose their quaintness and charm if Holbach's somewhat\r\nfantastic English were trifled with or his spelling, capitalization and\r\npunctuation modernized.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHOLBACH TO WILKES\r\n\r\nHÉEZE Aug. 9, 1746\r\n\r\n_Dearest Friend_\r\n\r\nI should not have felt by half enough the pleasure your kind letter gave\r\nme, If I had words to express it; I never doubted of your friendship,\r\nnor I hope do you know me so little as to doubt of mine, but your letter\r\nis full of such favorable sentiments to me that I must own I cannot\r\nrepay them but by renewing to you the entire gift of my heart that has\r\nbeen yours ever since heaven favour'd me with your acquaintance. I need\r\nnot tell you the sorrow our parting gave me, in vain Philosophy cried\r\naloud nature was still stronger and the philosopher was forced to yield\r\nto the friend, even now I feel the wound is not cur'd. Therefore no more\r\nof that--_Hope_ is my motto. Telling me you are happy you make me so\r\nbut in the middle of your happiness you dont forget your friend, What\r\nflattering thought to me! Such are the charms of friendship every\r\nevent is shar'd and nothing nor even the greatest intervals are able to\r\ninterrupt the happy harmony of truly united minds. I left Leyden about 8\r\nor 10 days after you but before my departure I thought myself obliged to\r\nlet Mr Dowdenwell know what you told me, he has seen the two letters Mr\r\nJohnson had received and I have been mediator of ye peace made betwixt\r\nthe 2 parties, I don't doubt but you have seen by this time Messrs Bland\r\n& Weatherill who were to set out for Engelland the same week I parted\r\nwith them. When I was leaving Leyden Mr Vernon happen'd to tell me he\r\nhad a great mind to make a trip to Spa. So my uncles' estate being on\r\nye road I desir'd him to come along with me, he has been here a week\r\nand went on afterwards in his journey, at my arrival here, I found that\r\nGeneral Count Palfi with an infinite number of military attendants had\r\ntaken possession of my uncles' house, and that the 16 thousd men lately\r\ncome from Germany to strengthen the allies army, commanded by Count\r\nBathiani and that had left ye neighborhood of Breda a few days before\r\nand was come to Falkenswert (where you have past in your journey to\r\nSpa) one hour from hence. Prince Charles arrived here the same day from\r\nGermany to take ye command of the allies, the next Day the whole army\r\namounting to 70thd men went on towards the county of Liège to prevent\r\nthe French from beseiging Namur, I hear now that the two armies are only\r\none hour from another, so we expect very soon the news of a great battle\r\nbut not without fear, Count Saxes army being, by all account of hundred\r\nten thoud. men besides. Prince Counti's army of 50 thd. this latter\r\nGeneral is now employ'd at the siege of Charleroy, that can't resist\r\na long while, it is a report that the King of France is arrived in\r\nhis army, I hope this long account will entertain you for want of news\r\npapers: Mr. Dowdeswell being left alone of our club at Leyden I Desir'd\r\nhim to come and spend with me the time of his vacations here, which\r\nproposal I hope he will accept and be here next week. What happy\r\ntriumvirat would be ours if you were to join: but that is impossible at\r\npresent; however those who cant enjoy reality are fond of feeding their\r\nfancies with agreable Dreams and charming pictures; that helps a little\r\nto sooth the sorrow of absence and makes one expect with more pati[ence]\r\ntill fortune allows him to put in execution the cherish'd systems he has\r\nbeen fed upon fore some [time] I shall expect with great many thanks the\r\nbooks you are to send me; it will be for me a dubble pleasure to read\r\nthem, being of your choice which I value as much as it deserves, and\r\nlooking at them as upon a new proof of your benevolence, as to those I\r\ndesign'd to get from Paris for you, I heard I could not get them before\r\nmy uncles' return hither all commerce being stopt by the way betwixt\r\nthis country and France.\r\n\r\nA few days before my departure from Leyden I receiv'd a letter from\r\nMr Freeman from Berlin, he seams vastly pleas'd with our Germany, and\r\nchiefly with Hambourg where a beautiful lady has taken in his heart the\r\nroom of poor Mss. Vitsiavius, my prophesy was just; traveling seems to\r\nhave alter'd a good deal his melancholy disposition as I may conjecture\r\nby his way of writing. He desired his service to you. As to me, Idleness\r\nrenders me every day more philosopher every passion is languishing\r\nwithin me, I retain but one in a warm degree, viz, friendship in\r\nwhich you share no small part. I took a whim to study a little Physic\r\naccordingly I purchased several books in that Way, and my empty hours\r\nhere are employ'd with them. I am sure your time will be much better\r\nemploy'd at Alesbury you'll find there a much nobler entertainment\r\nCupid is by far Lovlier than Esculapius, however I shall not envy your\r\nhappiness, in the Contrary I wish that all your desires be crown'd with\r\nsuccess, that a Passion that proves fatal to great many of men be void\r\nof sorrow for you, that all the paths of love be spred over with flowers\r\nin one Word that you may not address in vain to the charming Mss. M. I\r\nam almost tempted to fall in love with that unknown beauty, 't would not\r\nbe quite like Don Quixotte for your liking to her would be for me a very\r\nstrong prejudice of her merit, which the poor Knight had not in his love\r\nfor Dulcinea.\r\n\r\nI shall not ask your pardon for the length of this letter I am sure\r\nfriendship will forgive the time I steal to Love however I cannot give\r\nup so easily a conversation with a true friend with whom I fancy to\r\nspeak yet in one of those delightfull evening walks at Leyden. It is\r\na dream, I own it, but it is so agreable one to me that nothing but\r\nreality could be compared to the pleasure I feel: let me therefore\r\ninsist a little more upon't and travel with my Letter, we are gone! I\r\nthink to be at Alesbury! there I see my Dear Wilkes! What a Flurry\r\nof Panions! Joy! fear of a second parting! what charming tears! what\r\nsincere Kisses!--but time flows and the end of this Love is now as\r\nunwelcome to me, as would be to another to be awaken'd in the middle of\r\na Dream wherein he is going to enjoy a beloved mistress; the enchantment\r\nceases, the delightfull images vanish, and nothing is left to me but\r\nfriendship, which is of all my possessions the fairest, and the surest,\r\nI am most sincerely Dear Wilkes\r\n\r\n Your affectionate friend and humble servant\r\n DE HOLBACH\r\nHeze the 9th august 1746 N. S.\r\n\r\nI shall expect with impatience the letter you are to write me from\r\nAlesbury. Will it be here very soon!\r\n\r\n\r\nHOLBACH TO WILKES [HÉEZE Dec. 3rd. 1746]\r\n\r\n_Dearest Wilkes_\r\n\r\nDuring a little voyage I have made into Germany I have received your\r\ncharming letter of the 8th. September O. S. the many affairs I have been\r\nbusy with for these 3 months has hindered me hitherto from returning\r\nto you as speedy an answer as I should have done. I know too much your\r\nkindness for me to make any farther apology and I hope you are enough\r\nacquainted with the sincerety of my friendship towards you to adscribe\r\nmy fault to forgetfulness or want of gratitude be sure, Dear friend,\r\nthat such a disposition will allways be unknown to me in regard to\r\nyou. I don't doubt but you will be by this time returned at London,\r\nthe winter season being an obstacle to the pleasures you have enjoyed\r\nfollowing ye Letter at Alesbury during the last Autumn. I must own I\r\nhave felt a good deal of pride when you gave me the kind assurance\r\nthat love has not made you forget an old friend, I need not tell you my\r\ndisposition. I hope you know it well enough and like my friendship for\r\nyou has no bounds I want expressions to show it. Mr Dowdeswell has been\r\nso good as to let me enjoy his company here in the month of August, and\r\nreturned to Leyden to pursue his studies in the middle of September.\r\nWe often wished your company and made sincere libations to you with\r\nburgundy and Champaigne I had a few weeks there after I set out for\r\nGermany where I expected to spend the whole winter but the sudden death\r\nof my Uncle's Steward has forced me to come back here to put in order\r\nthe affairs of this estate, I don't know how long I shall be obliged to\r\nstay in the meanwhile I act pretty well the part of a County Squire, id\r\nest, hunting, shooting, fishing, walking every day without to lay aside\r\nthe ever charming conversation of Horace Virgil Homer and all our noble\r\nfriends of the Elysian fields. They are allways faithfull to me, with\r\ntheir aid I find very well how to employ my time, but I want in this\r\ncountry a true bosom friend like my dear Wilkes to converse with, but my\r\npretenssions are too high, for every abode with such a company would be\r\nheaven for me.\r\n\r\nI perceive by your last letter that your hopes are very like to succeed\r\nby Mss Mead, you are sure that every happines that can befall to you\r\nwill make me vastly happy. I beseech you therefore to let me know\r\neverytime how far you are gone, I take it to be a very good omen for\r\nyou, that your lovely mistress out of compliance has vouchsafed to learn\r\na harsh high-dutch name, which would otherwise have made her starttle,\r\nat the very hearing of it. I am very thankful for her kind desire\r\nof seeing me in Engelland which I dont wish the less but you know my\r\ncircumstances enough, to guess that I cannot follow my inclinations. I\r\nhave not heard hitherto anything about the books you have been so kind\r\nas to send me over by the opportunity of a friend. I have wrote about it\r\nto Msrs Conrad et Bouwer of Rotterdam, they answered that they were not\r\nyet there. Nevertheless I am very much oblided to you for your kindness\r\nand wish to find very soon the opportunity of my revenge. Mr Dowderswell\r\ncomplains very much of Mrs Bland and Weatherill, having not heard of\r\nthem since their departure from Leyden. I desire my compliments to Mr\r\nDyer and all our old acquaintances. Pray be so good as to direct your\r\nfirst letter under the covert of Mr Dowderwell at Ms Alliaume's at\r\nLeyden he shall send it to me over immediately, no more at Mr Van\r\nSprang's like you used to do. I wish to know if Mr Lyson since his\r\nreturn to his native country, continues in his peevish cross temper. If\r\nyou have any news besides I'll be glad to hear them by your next which I\r\nexpect very soon.\r\n\r\nAbout politicks I cannot tell you anything at present, you have heard\r\nenough by this time the fatal battle fought near Liège in 8ber last;\r\neverybody has little hopes of the Congress of Breda, the Austrian and\r\nPiedmontese are entered into provence, which is not as difficult as to\r\nmaintain themselves therein, I wish a speedy peace would enable us both\r\nto see the rejoicings that will attend the marriage of the Dauphin\r\nof France with a Princess of Saxony. I have heard that peace is made\r\nbetween England and Spain, which you ought to know better than I. We\r\nfear very much for the next campaign the siege of Maestrich in our\r\nneighborhood. These are all the news I know. I'll tell you another that\r\nyou have known a long while viz. that nobody is with more sincerity My\r\nDear Wilkes\r\n\r\n Your faithfull humble Servant and Friend\r\n HOLBACH\r\nHeeze the 3 d Xber 1746 ns\r\n\r\n\r\nBy 1750 Holbach was established in Paris as a young man of the world.\r\nHis fortune, his learning, his sociability attracted the younger\r\nliterary set toward him. In 1749 he was already holding his Thursday\r\ndinners which later became so famous. Among his early friends were\r\nDiderot, Rousseau and Grimm. With them he took the side of the Italian\r\n_Opera buffa_ in the famous musical quarrel of 1752, and published\r\ntwo witty brochures ridiculing French music. [12:9] He was an art\r\nconnoisseur and bought Oudry's _Chienne allaitant ses petits_, the _chef\r\nd'oeuvre_ of the Salon of 1753. [12:10] During these years he was hard\r\nat work at his chosen sciences of chemistry and mineralogy. In 1752\r\nhe published in a huge volume in quarto with excellent plates, a\r\ntranslation of Antonio Neri's _Art of Glass making_, and in 1753 a\r\ntranslation of Wallerius' _Mineralogy_. On July 26, 1754, the Academy\r\nof Berlin made him a foreign associate in recognition of his scholarly\r\nattainments in Natural History, [12:11] and later he was elected to the\r\nAcademies of St. Petersburg and Mannheim.\r\n\r\nAll that was now lacking to this brilliant young man was an attractive\r\nwife to rule over his salon. His friends urged him to wed, and in 1753\r\nhe married Mlle. Basile-Genevieve-Susanne d'Aine, daughter of \"Maître\r\nMarius-Jean-Baptiste Nicolas d'Aine, conseiller au Roi en son grand\r\nconseil, associé externe de l'Acad. des sciences et belles letters de\r\nPrusse.\" [12:12] M. d'Aine was also Maître des Requêtes and a man\r\nof means. Mme. d'Holbach was a very charming and gracious woman and\r\nHolbach's good fortune seemed complete when suddenly Mme. d'Holbach died\r\nfrom a most loathsome and painful disease in the summer of 1754. Holbach\r\nwas heart-broken and took a trip through the provinces with his friend\r\nGrimm, to whom he was much attached, to distract his mind from his\r\ngrief. He returned in the early winter and the next year (1755) got a\r\nspecial dispensation from the Pope to marry his deceased wife's sister,\r\nMlle. Charlotte-Susanne d'Aine. By her he had four children, two sons\r\nand two daughters. The first, Charles-Marius, was born about the middle\r\nof August, 1757, and baptized in Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois, Aug. 22.\r\nHe inherited the family title and was a captain in the regiment of the\r\nSchomberg-Dragons. [13:13] The first daughter was born towards the end\r\nof 1758 and the second about the middle of Jan., 1760. [13:14] The elder\r\nmarried the Marquis de Châtenay and the younger the Marquis de Nolivos,\r\n\"Captaine au régiment de la Seurre, Dragons.\" Their Majesties the King\r\nand Queen and the Royal Family signed their marriage contract May 27,\r\n1781. [13:15] Of the second son there seem to be no traces. Holbach's\r\nmother-in-law, Madame d'Aine, was a very interesting old woman as she\r\nis pictured in Diderot's _Mémoires_, and there was a brother-in-law,\r\n\"Messire Marius-Jean-Baptiste-Nicholas d'Aine, chevalier, conseiller\r\ndu roi en ses conseils, Maître des requêtes honoraire de son hôtel,\r\nintendant de justice, police, et finances de la généralité de Tours,\"\r\nwho lived in rue Saint Dominique, paroisse Saint-Sulpice. There was in\r\nHolbach's household for a long time an old Scotch surgeon, a homeless,\r\nmisanthropic old fellow by the name of Hope, of whom Diderot gives a\r\nmost interesting account. [14:16] These are the only names we have of\r\nthe personnel of Holbach's household. His town house was in the rue\r\nRoyale, butte Saint-Roch. It was here that for an almost unbroken period\r\nof forty years he gave his Sunday and Thursday dinners. The latter day\r\nwas known to the more intimate set of encyclopedists as the _jour du\r\nsynagogue_. Here the _église philosophique_ met regularly to discuss its\r\ndoctrines and publish its propaganda of radicalism.\r\n\r\nHolbach had a very pleasant country seat, the château of Grandval,\r\nnow in the arrondisement of Boissy St. Léger at Sucy-en-Brie. It is\r\npleasantly situated in the valley of a little stream, the Morbra, which\r\nflows into the Marne. The property was really the estate of Mme. d'Aine\r\nwho lived with the Holbachs. Here the family and their numerous guests\r\npassed the late summer and fall. Here Diderot spent weeks at a time\r\nworking on the Encyclopedia, dining, and walking on the steep slopes\r\nof the Marne with congenial companions. To him we are indebted for our\r\nintimate knowledge of Grandval and its inhabitants, their slightest\r\ndoings and conversations; and as Danou has well said, if we were to wish\r\nourselves back in any past age we should choose with many others the\r\nmid-eighteenth century and the charming society of Paris and Grandval.\r\n[14:17]\r\n\r\nHolbach's life, in common with that of most philosophers, offers no\r\nevents, except that he came near being killed in the crush and riot in\r\nthe rue Royale that followed the fire at the Dauphin's wedding in 1770.\r\n[15:18] He was never an official personage. His entire life was spent\r\nin study, writing and conversation with his friends. He traveled very\r\nlittle; the world came to him, to the _Café de l'Europe_, as Abbé\r\nGaliani called Paris. From time to time Holbach went to Contrexéville\r\nfor his gout and once to England to visit David Garrick; but he disliked\r\nEngland very thoroughly and was glad to get back to Paris. The events of\r\nhis life in so far as there were any, were his relations with people.\r\nHe knew intimately practically all the great men of his century, except\r\nMontesquieu and Voltaire, who were off the stage before his day. [15:19]\r\nHolbach's most intimate and life-long friend among the great figures\r\nof the century was Diderot, of whom Rousseau said, \"À la distance de\r\nquelques siècles du moment où il a vécu, Diderot paraîtra un homme\r\nprodigieux; on regardera de loin cette tête universelle avec une\r\nadmiration mêlée d'étonnement, comme nous regardons aujourd'hui la tête\r\ndes Platon et des Aristote.\" [15:20] All his contemporaries agreed that\r\nnothing was so charged with divine fire as the conversation of\r\nDiderot. Gautherin, in his fine bronze of him on the Place\r\nSaint-Germain-des-Près, seems to have caught the spirit of his talk and\r\nhas depicted him as he might have sat in the midst of Holbach's society,\r\nof which he was the inspiration and the soul. Holbach backed Diderot\r\nfinancially in his great literary and scientific undertaking and\r\nprovided articles for the Encyclopedia on chemistry and natural science.\r\nDiderot had a high opinion of his erudition and said of him, \"Quelque\r\nsystème que forge mon imagination, je suis sur que mon ami d'Holbach me\r\ntrouve des faits et des autorités pour le justifier.\" [16:21] Opinions\r\ndiffer in regard to the intellectual influence of these men upon each\r\nother. Diderot was without doubt the greater thinker, but Holbach stated\r\nhis atheism with far greater clarity and Diderot gave his sanction to\r\nit by embellishing Holbach's books with a few eloquent pages of his\r\nown. Diderot said to Sir Samuel Romilly in 1781, \"Il faut _sabrer_\r\nla théologie,\" [16:22] and died in 1784 in the belief that complete\r\ninfidelity was the first step toward philosophy. Five years later\r\nHolbach was buried by his side in the crypt of the Chapel of the Virgin\r\nbehind the high altar in Saint-Roch. No tablet marks their tombs, and\r\nalthough repeated investigations have been made no light has been thrown\r\non the exact position of their burial place. According to Diderot's\r\ndaughter, Mme. Vandeuil, their entire correspondence has been destroyed\r\nor lost. [16:23]\r\n\r\nHolbach's relations with Rousseau were less harmonious. The account\r\nof their mutual misunderstandings contained in the _Confessions_, in a\r\nletter by Cerutti in the _Journal de Paris_ Dec. 2, 1789, and in\r\nprivate letters of Holbach's to Hume, Garrick, and Wilkes, is a long and\r\ntiresome tale. The author of _Eclaircissements relatifs à la publication\r\ndes confessions de Rousseau..._ (Paris, 1789) blames the _club\r\nholbachique_ for their treatment of Rousseau, but the fault seems to\r\nlie on both sides. According to Rousseau's account, Holbach sought his\r\nfriendship and for a few years he was one of Holbach's society. But,\r\nafter the success of the _Devin du Village_ in 1753, the _holbachiens_\r\nturned against him out of jealousy of his genius as a composer. Visions\r\nof a dark plot against him rose before his fevered and sensitive\r\nimagination, and after 1756 he left the Society of the Encyclopedists,\r\nnever to return. Holbach, on the other hand, while admitting rather\r\nquestionable treatment of Rousseau, never speaks of any personal injury\r\non his part, and bewails the fact that \"l'homme le plus éloquent s'est\r\nrendu ainsi l'homme le plus anti-littéraire, et l'homme le plus sensible\r\ns'est rendu le plus anti-social.\" [17:24] He did warn Hume against\r\ntaking him to England, and in a letter to Wilkes predicted the quarrel\r\nthat took place shortly after. In writing to Garrick [17:25] he says\r\nsome hard but true things about Rousseau, who on his part never really\r\ndefamed Holbach but depicted him as the virtuous atheist under the guise\r\nof Wolmar in the _Nouvelle Heloïse_. Their personal incompatibility\r\nis best explained on the grounds of the radical differences in their\r\ntemperaments and types of mind and by the fact that Rousseau was too\r\nsensitive to get on with anybody for any great length of time.\r\n\r\nTwo other great Frenchmen, Buffon and d'Alembert, were for a time\r\nmembers of Holbach's society, but, for reasons that are not altogether\r\nclear, gradually withdrew. Grimm suggests that Buffon did not find the\r\nyoung philosophers sufficiently deferential to him and to the authorized\r\npowers, and feared for his dignity,--and safety, in their company.\r\nD'Alembert, on the other hand, was a recluse by nature, and, after\r\ngiving up his editorship on the Encyclopedia, easily dropped out of\r\nDiderot's society and devoted himself to Mlle. Lespinasse and Mme.\r\nGeoffrin. Holbach and Helvetius were life-long friends and spent much\r\ntime together reading at Helvetius's country place at Voré. After his\r\ndeath in 1774, Holbach frequented Mme. Helvetius' salon where he\r\nknew and deeply influenced Volney, Cabanis, de Tracy, and the first\r\ngeneration of the Ideologists who continued his and Helvetius'\r\nphilosophical doctrines. Among the other Frenchmen of the day who were\r\non intimate relations with Holbach and frequented his salon were La\r\nCondamine, Condillac, Condorcet, Turgot, Morellet, Raynal, Grimm,\r\nMarmontel, Colardeau, Saurin, Suard, Saint-Lambert, Thomas, Duclos,\r\nChastellux, Boulanger, Darcet, Roux, Rouelle, Barthès, Venel, Leroy,\r\nDamilaville, Naigeon, Lagrange and lesser names,--but well known in\r\nParis in the eighteenth century,--d'Alinville, Chauvelin, Desmahis,\r\nGauffecourt, Margency, de Croismare, de Pezay, Coyer, de Valory,\r\nCharnoi, not to mention a host of others.\r\n\r\nAmong Holbach's most intimate English friends were Hume, Garrick,\r\nWilkes, Sterne, Gibbon, Horace Walpole, Adam Smith, Benjamin Franklin,\r\nDr. Priestley, Lord Shelburne, Gen. Barré, Gen. Clark, Sir James\r\nMacDonald, Dr. Gem, Messrs. Stewart, Demster, Fordyce, Fitzmaurice,\r\nFoley, etc. Holbach addressed a letter to Hume in 1762, before making\r\nhis acquaintance, in which he expressed his admiration of his philosophy\r\nand the desire to know him personally. [18:26] In 1764 Hume came to\r\nParis as secretary of the British Embassy and immediately called on\r\nHolbach and became a regular frequenter of his salon. It was to Holbach\r\nthat he wrote first on the outbreak of his quarrel with Rousseau and\r\nthey corresponded at length in egard to the publication of the _Exposé\r\nsuccinct_, which was to justify Hume in the eyes of the French. Hume and\r\nHolbach had much in common intellectually, although the latter was far\r\nmore thoroughgoing in his repudiation of Theism.\r\n\r\nDavid Garrick and his wife were frequent visitors at the rue Royale\r\non their trips to Paris where they were very much liked by Holbach's\r\nsociety. Nothing is more cordial or gracious than the compliments passed\r\nbetween them in their subsequent correspondence. There are two published\r\nletters from Holbach in Mr. Hedgecock's recent study of Garrick and his\r\nFrench friends, excellent examples of the happy spontaneity and sympathy\r\nthat were characteristic of French sociability in the eighteenth\r\ncentury. [19:27] Holbach in turn spent several months with Garrick at\r\nHampton.\r\n\r\nHolbach's early friendship for Wilkes has already been mentioned. Wilkes\r\nspent a great deal of time in Paris on the occasion of his exiles from\r\nEngland and became very intimate with Holbach. They corresponded up to\r\nthe very end of Holbach's life and there was a constant interchange of\r\nfriendly offices between them. [19:28] Miss Wilkes, who spent much time\r\nin Paris, was a very good friend of Mme. Holbach and Mlle. Helvetius.\r\nAdam Smith often dined at Holbach's with Turgot and the economists;\r\nGibbon also found his dinners agreeable except for the dogmatism of the\r\natheists; Walpole resented it also and kept away. Priestley seems\r\nto have gotten on very well, although the philosophers found his\r\nmaterialism and unitarianism a trifle inconsistent. It was at Holbach's\r\nthat Shelburne met Morellet with whom he carried on a long and serious\r\ncorrespondence on economics. There seem to be no details of Holbach's\r\nrelations with Franklin, who was evidently more assiduous at the salon\r\nof Mme. Helvetius whom he desired to marry.\r\n\r\nHolbach's best friend among the Italians was Abbé Galiani, secretary\r\nof the Neapolitan Embassy, who spent ten years in the salons of Paris.\r\nAfter his return to Naples his longing for Paris led him to a voluminous\r\ncorrespondence with his French friends including Holbach. A few of their\r\nletters are extant. Beccaria also came to Paris at the invitation of\r\nthe translator of his _Crimes and Punishments_, Abbé Morellet, made on\r\nbehalf of Holbach and his society. Beccaria and his friend Veri, who\r\naccompanied him, had long been admirers of French philosophy, and the\r\nFrenchmen found much to admire in Beccaria's book. One _avocat-général_,\r\nM. Servan of the Parlement of Bordeaux, a friend of Holbach's, tried\r\nto put his reforms in practice and shared the fate of most reformers.\r\nHolbach was also in correspondence with Beccaria, and one of his letters\r\nhas been published in M. Landry's recent study of Beccaria.\r\n\r\nAmong the other Italians whom Holbach befriended were Paulo Frizi, the\r\nmathematician; Dr. Gatti; Pincini, the musician; and Mme. Riccoboni,\r\nex-actress and novelist; whose lively correspondence with Garrick whom\r\nshe met at Holbach's sheds much light on the social relations of the\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nAmong the other foreigners who were friends or acquaintances of Holbach\r\nwere his fellow countrymen, Frederich Melchon Grimm, like himself a\r\nnaturalized Frenchman and the bosom friend of Diderot; Meister, his\r\ncollaborator in the _Literary Correspondence_; Kohant, a Bohemian\r\nmusician, composer, of the _Bergère des Alpes_ and Mme. Holbach's\r\nlute-teacher; Baron Gleichen, Comte de Creutz, Danish and Scandinavian\r\ndiplomats; and a number of German nobles; the hereditary princes of\r\nBrunswick and Saxe Gotha, Baron Alaberg, afterwards elector of Mayence,\r\nBaron Schomberg and Baron Studitz.\r\n\r\nAmong the well known women of the century Holbach was most intimate with\r\nMme. d'Epinay, who became a very good friend of Mme. Holbach's and was\r\npresent at the birth of her first son, and, in her will, left her a\r\nportrait by Rembrandt. He was also a friend of Mme. Geoffrin, attended\r\nher salon, and knew Mlle. de Lespinasse, Mme. Houderot and most of the\r\nimportant women of the day.\r\n\r\nThere are excellent sources from which to form an estimate of this man\r\nwhose house was the social centre of the century. Just after Holbach's\r\ndeath on January 21, 1789, Naigeon, his literary agent, who had lived on\r\nterms of the greatest intimacy with him for twenty-four years, wrote a\r\nlong eulogy which filled the issue of the _Journal de Paris_ for Feb.\r\n9. There was another letter to the _Journal_ on Feb. 12. Grimm's\r\n_Correspondance Littéraire_ for March contains a long account of him\r\nby Meister, and there are other notices in contemporary memoirs such as\r\nMorellet's and Marmontel's. All these accounts agree in picturing him as\r\nthe most admirable of men.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that Holbach always enjoyed what was held to be a\r\nconsiderable fortune in his day. From his estates in Westphalia he had\r\na yearly income of 60,000 _livres_ which he spent in entertaining. This\r\nfreedom from economic pressure gave him leisure to devote his time\r\nto his chosen intellectual pursuits and to his friends. He was a\r\nuniversally learned man. He knew French, German, English, Italian and\r\nLatin extremely well and had a fine private library of about three\r\nthousand works often of several volumes each, in these languages and in\r\nGreek and Hebrew. The catalogue of this library was published by Debure\r\nin 1789. It would be difficult to imagine a more comprehensive and\r\ncomplete collection of its size. He had also a rich collection\r\nof drawings by the best masters, fine pictures of which he was a\r\nconnoisseur, bronzes, marbles, porcelains and a natural history cabinet,\r\nso in vogue in those days, containing some very valuable specimens.\r\nHe was one of the most learned men of his day in natural science,\r\nespecially chemistry and mineralogy, and to his translations from the\r\nbest German scientific works is largely due the spread of scientific\r\nlearning in France in the eighteenth century. Holbach was also very\r\nwidely read in English theology and philosophy of the seventeenth and\r\neighteenth centuries and derived his anti-theological inspiration from\r\nthese two sources. To this vast fund of learning, he joined an extreme\r\nmodesty and simplicity. He sought no academic honors, published all\r\nhis works anonymously, and, had it not been for the pleasure he took in\r\ncommunicating his ideas to his friends, no one would have suspected his\r\ngreat erudition. He had an extraordinary memory and the reputation of\r\nnever forgetting anything of interest. This plenitude of information,\r\ncoupled with his easy and pleasant manner of talking, made his society\r\nmuch sought after. Naigeon said of him (in his preface to the works of\r\nLagrange):\r\n\r\nPersonne n'était plus communicatif que M. le baron d'Holbach; personne\r\nne prenait aux progrès de la raison un intérêt plus vif, plus sincère,\r\net ne s'occupait avec plus de zèle et l'activité des moyens de les\r\naccélérer.\r\n\r\nÉgalement versé dans la plupart des matières sur lesquelles il importe\r\nle plus à des êtres raisonnables d'avoir une opinion arrêtée, M. le\r\nbaron d'Holbach portait dans leur discussion un jugement sain, une\r\nlogique sévère, et une analyse exacte et précise. Quelque fut l'objet de\r\nses entretiens avec ses amis, ou même avec des indifférens, tels qu'en\r\noffrent plus ou moins toutes les sociétés; il inspirait sans effort à\r\nceux qui l'écoutaient l'enthousiasme de l'art ou de la science dont\r\nil parlait; et on ne le quittait jamais sans regretter de n'avoir pas\r\ncultivé la branche particulière de connaissances qui avait fait le sujet\r\nde la conversation, sans désirer d'être plus instruit, plus éclairé, et\r\nsurtout sans admirer la claret, la justesse de son esprit, et l'ordre\r\ndans lequel il savait présenter ses idées.\r\n\r\nThis virtue of communicativeness, of _sociabilité_, Holbach carried into\r\nall the relations of life. He was always glad to lend or give his books\r\nto anyone who could make use of them. \"Je suis riche,\" he used to say,\r\n\"mais je ne vois dans la fortune qu'un instrument de plus pour opérer\r\nle bien plus promptement et plus efficacement.\" In fact Holbach's whole\r\nprinciple of life and action was to increase the store of human well\r\nbeing. And he did this without any religious motive whatsoever. As Julie\r\nsays of Wolmar in _La Nouvelle Heloïse_, \"Il fait le bien sans espoir de\r\nrécompense, il est plus vertueux, plus désintéressé que nous.\" There are\r\nmany recorded instances of Holbach's gracious benevolence. As he said to\r\nHelvetius, \"Vous êtes brouillé avec tous ceux que vous avez obligé, mais\r\nj'ai gardé tous mes amis.\" Holbach had the faculty of attaching people\r\nto him. Diderot tells how at the Salon of 1753 after Holbach had bought\r\nOudry's famous picture, all the collectors who had passed it by came to\r\nhim and offered him twice what he paid for it. Holbach went to find\r\nthe artist to ask him permission to cede the picture to his profit,\r\nbut Oudry refused, saying that he was only too happy that his best work\r\nbelonged to the man who was the first to appreciate it. Instances of\r\nHolbach's liberality to Kohant, a poor musician, and to Suard, a poor\r\nliterary man, are to be found in the pages of Diderot and Meister, and\r\nhis constant generosity to his friends is a commonplace in their Memoirs\r\nand Correspondence. Only Rousseau was ungrateful enough to complain\r\nthat Holbach's free-handed gifts insulted his poverty. His kindness to\r\nLagrange, a young literary man whom he rescued from want, has been well\r\ntold by M. Naigeon in the preface to the works of Lagrange (p. xviii).\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most touching instances of Holbach's benevolence are his\r\nrelations with the peasants of Contrexéville, one of which was published\r\nin the _Journal de Lecture_, 1775, the other in an anonymous letter\r\nto the _Journal de Paris_, Feb. 12, 1789. The first concerns the\r\nreconciliation of two old peasants who, not wanting to go to court,\r\nbrought their differences to their respected friend for a settlement.\r\nNothing is more simple and beautiful than this homely tale as told in\r\na letter of Holbach's to a friend of his. The second, which John Wilkes\r\nsaid ought to be written in letters of gold, deserves to be reproduced\r\nas a whole.\r\n\r\nL'éloge funèbre que M. Naigeon a consacré à la mémoire de M. le Baron\r\nd'Holbach suffit pour donner une idée juste de ses lumières, mais le\r\nhasard m'a mis à portée de les juger encore mieux. J'ai vu M. le Baron\r\nd'Holbach dans deux voyages que j'ai faits aux eaux de Contrexéville.\r\nS'occuper de sa souffrance et de sa guérison, c'est le soin de chaque\r\nmalade. M. le Baron d'Holbach devenait le médecin, l'ami, le consolateur\r\nde quiconque venait aux eaux et il semblait bien moins occupé de ses\r\ninfirmités que de celles des autres. Lorsque des malades indigens\r\nmanquaient de secours, ou pécuniaires ou curatifs, il les leur procurait\r\navec un plaisir qui lui faisait plus de bien que les eaux. Je me\r\npromenais un soir avec lui sur une hauteur couverte d'un massif de bois\r\nqui fait perspective de loin et près duquel s'élève un petit Hermitage.\r\nLà, demeure un cénobite qui n'a de revenu que les aumônes de ceux dont\r\nil reçoit les visites. Nous acquittâmes chacun notre dette hospitalière.\r\nEn prenant congé de l'Hermite, M. le Baron d'Holbach me dit de le\r\nprécéder un instant et qu'il allait me suivre. Je le précédai, et comme\r\nil ne me suivait pas je m'arrêtai, pour l'attendre sur un terte exhaussé\r\nd'où l'on découvre tout le pays. Je contemplais le canton que je\r\ndominais, plongé dans une douce rêverie. J'en fus tiré par des cris et\r\nje me retournai vers l'endroit d'òu ils partaient. Je vis M. le Baron\r\nd'Holbach environné d'une vieille femme et de deux villageois, l'un\r\nvieux comme elle et l'autre jeune. Tous trois, les larmes aux yeux,\r\nl'embrassaient hautement. Allez vous-en donc, s'écrait M. le Baron\r\nd'Holbach; laissez moi, on m'attend, ne me suivez pas, adieu; je\r\nreviendrai l'année prochaine. En me voyant arriver vers eux, les trois\r\npersonnes reconnaissantes disparurent. Je lui demandai le sujet de tant\r\nde bénédictions. Ce jeune paysan que vous avez vu s'etait engagé, j'ai\r\nobtenu de son colonel sa liberté en payant les cents écus prescrits par\r\nl'ordonnance. Il est amoureux d'une jeune paysanne aussi pauvre que\r\nlui, je viens d'acheter pour eux un petit bien qui m'a coûté huit cent\r\nfrancs. Le vieux père est perclus, aux deux bras, de rhumatismes, je lui\r\nai fourni trois boîtes du baume des Valdejeots, si estimé en ce pays-ci.\r\nLa vieille mère est sujetté à des maux d'estomac, et je lui ai apporté\r\nun pot de confection d'hyacinthe. Ils travaillaient dans le champ,\r\nvoisin du bois, je suis allé les voir tandis que vous marchiez en avant.\r\nIls m'ont suivi malgré moi. Ne parlez de cela à personne. On dirait\r\nque je veux faire le généreux et le bon philosophe, mais je ne suis que\r\nhumain, et mes charités sont la plus agréable dépense de mes voyages.\r\n\r\nThis humanity of Holbach's is the very keynote of his character and of\r\nhis intellectual life as well. As M. Walferdin has said, the denial of\r\nthe supernatural was for him the base of all virtue, and resting on this\r\nprinciple, he exemplified social qualities that do the greatest honor to\r\nhuman nature. He and Madame Holbach are the only conspicuous examples\r\nof conjugal fidelity and happiness among all the people that one has\r\noccasion to mention in a study of the intellectual and literary circles\r\nof the eighteenth century. They were devoted to each other, to their\r\nchildren and to their friends. Considering the traits of Holbach's\r\ncharacter that have been cited, there can scarcely be two opinions in\r\nregard to completeness with which he realized his ideal of humanity\r\nand sociability. M. Naigeon has well summed up in a few words Holbach's\r\nrelation to the only duties that he recognized, \"He was a good husband,\r\na good father and a good friend.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. HOLBACH'S WORKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHolbach's published works, with the exception of a few scattered\r\nones, may be divided into three classes, viz., translations of German\r\nscientific works, translations of English deistical writings, and his\r\nown works on theology, philosophy, politics and morals. Those which fall\r\ninto none of these categories can be dealt with very summarily. They\r\nare:\r\n\r\n1. Two pamphlets on the musical dispute of 1752; _Lettre à une dame d'un\r\ncertain âge sur l'état présent de l'Opéra_, (8vo, pp. 11) and _Arrêt\r\nrendu à l'amphithéâtre de l'Opéra_, (8vo, pp. 16,) both directed against\r\nFrench music and in line with Grimm's _Petit Prophète_ and Rousseau's\r\n_Lettre sur la musique française_.\r\n\r\n2. A translation in prose of Akenside's _The Pleasures of Imagination_\r\n(Paris, 1759, 8vo).\r\n\r\n3. A translation of Swift's _History of the Reign of Queen Anne_ in\r\ncollaboration with M. Eidous (Amsterdam, 1765, 12mo, pp. xxiv + 416).\r\n\r\n4. Translations of an _Ode on Human Life_ and a _Hymn to the Sun_ in the\r\n_Variétés littéraires_ (1768).\r\n\r\n5. Articles on natural science in the _Encyclopédie_ and article\r\n_Prononciation des langues_ in the _Dictionnaire de Grammaire_ of the\r\n_Encyclopédie méthodique_.\r\n\r\n6. Translation of Wallerius' _Agriculture reduced to its true\r\nprinciples_ (Paris, 1774, 12mo).\r\n\r\n7. Two _Facéties philosophiques_ published in Grimm's _Correspondence\r\nLittéraire. L'Abbé et le Rabbin_, and _Essai sur l'art de ramper, à\r\nl'usage des courtisans_.\r\n\r\n8. Parts of Raynal's _Histoire philosophique des deux Indes_.\r\n\r\n9. Notes to Lagrange's _Vie de Senèque_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHolbach's translations of German scientific works are as follows:\r\n(Complete titles to be found in Bibliography, Pt. I.)\r\n\r\n1. _Art de la Verrerie de Neri, Merret, et Kunckel_ (Paris, Durand,\r\n1752). Original work in Italian. Latin translation by Christopher\r\nMerret. German translation by J. Kunckel of Löwenstern. Holbach's\r\ntranslation comprises the seven books of Antionio Neri, Merret's\r\nnotes on Neri, Kunckel's observations on both these authors, his own\r\nexperiments and others relative to glass-making. The translation\r\nwas dedicated to Malesherbes who had desired to see the best German\r\nscientific works published in French. In his _Préface du Traducteur_\r\nHolbach writes:\r\n\r\nL'envie de me rendre utile, dont tout citoyen doit être animé, m'a fait\r\nentreprendre l'ouvrage que je présente au Public. S'il a le bonheur\r\nde mériter son approbation, quoiqu'il y ait peu de gloire attachée\r\nau travail ingrat et fastidieux d'un Traducteur, je me déterminerai à\r\ndonner les meilleurs ouvrages allemands, sur l'Histoire Naturelle,\r\nla Minéralogie, la Métallurgie et la Chymie. Tout le monde sait que\r\nl'Allemagne possede en ce genre des trésors qui ont été jusqu'ici comme\r\nenfouis pour la France.\r\n\r\n2. _Minéralogie ou Description générale du règne mineral par J. G.\r\nWallerius_ (Paris, Durand, 1753) followed by _Hydrologie_ by the same\r\nauthor. Second edition, Paris, Herrissant, 1759. Originally in Swedish\r\n(Wallerius was a professor of chemistry in the University of Upsala).\r\nGerman translation by J. D. Denso, Professor of Chemistry, Stargard,\r\nPomerania. Holbach's translation was made from the German edition which\r\nWallerius considered preferable to the Swedish. He was assisted by\r\nBernard de Jussien and Rouelle, and the work was dedicated to a friend\r\nand co-worker in the natural sciences, Monsieur d'Arclais de Montamy.\r\n\r\n3. _Introduction à la Minéralogie... oeuvre posthume de M. J. F.\r\nHenckel_, Paris, Cavelier, 1756, first published under title _Henckelius\r\nin Mineralogiâ redivivus_, Dresden, 1747, by his pupil, M. Stephani,\r\nas an outline of his lectures. Holbach's translation made from a German\r\nedition, corrected, with notes on new discoveries added.\r\n\r\n4. _Chimie métallurgique... par M. C. Gellert_. Paris, Briasson, 1758,\r\ntranslated earlier. Approbation May 1, 1753, Privilege Dec. 21, 1754.\r\nOriginally a text written by Gellert for four artillery officers whom\r\nthe King of Sardinia sent to Freyburg to learn mining-engineering.\r\n\r\n5. _Traités de physique, d'histoire naturelle, de mineralogy et de\r\nmétallurgie_. Paris, Herrissant, 1759, by J. G. Lehmann, three vols. I.\r\nL'Art des Mines, II. Traité de la formation des métaux, III. Essai d'une\r\nhistoire naturelle des couches de la terre. In his preface to the third\r\nvolume Holbach has some interesting remarks about the deluge, the irony\r\nof which seems to have escaped the royal censor, Millet, _Docteur en\r\nThéologie_.\r\n\r\n\"La description si précise et si détaillée que Moïse fait du Deluge dans\r\nla Genèse, ayant une autorité infaillible, puis qu'elle n'est autre\r\nque celle de Dieu même, nous rend certains de la réalité et de\r\nl'universalité de ce châtiment terrible. Il s'agit simplement d'examiner\r\nsi les naturalistes, tels que Woodward, Schenchzer, Buttner et M.\r\nLehmann lui-même ne se sont points trompés, lorsqu'ils ont attribué à\r\ncet événement seul la formation des couches de la terre et lorsqu'ils\r\ns'en sont servis pour expliquer l'état actuel de notre globe. Il semble\r\nque rien ne doit nous empêcher d'agiter cette question; l'Ecriture\r\nsainte se contente de nous apprendre la voie miraculeuse dont Dieu s'est\r\nservi pour punir les crimes du genre humain; elle ne dit rien qui puisse\r\nlimiter les sentiments des naturalistes sur les autres effets physiques\r\nque le déluge a pu produire. C'est une matière qu'elle paroît avoir\r\nabandonnée aux disputes des hommes.\" He then proceeds to question\r\nwhether the deluge could have produced the results attributed to it\r\nand argues against catastrophism which, it must be remembered, was the\r\nreceived geological doctrine down to the days of Lyell. \"Les causes les\r\nplus simples sont capables de produire au bout des siècles les effets\r\nles plus grands, surtout lorsqu'elles agissent incessament; et nous\r\nvoyons toutes ces causes réunies agir perpétuellement sous nos yeux.\r\nConcluons, donc, de tout ce qui précède, que le déluge, seul et les feux\r\nsouterrains seuls ne suffisent point pour expliquer la formation des\r\ncouches de la terre. On risquera toujours de se tromper, lorsque par\r\nl'envie de simplifier on voudra dériver tous les phénomènes de la nature\r\nd'une seule et unique cause.\"\r\n\r\n6. _Pyritologie_ by J. F. Henkel, Paris, Herrissant, 1760, a large\r\nvolume in quarto, translated by Holbach. It contains _Flora Saturnisans_\r\n(translated by M. Charas and reviewed by M. Roux), Henkel's _Opuscules\r\nMinéralogiques_ and other treatises. Original editions: _Pyritologia_,\r\nLeipzig, 1725, 1754; _Flora Saturnisans_, Leipzig, 1721; _De\r\nAppropriatione Chymica_, Dresden, 1727, and _De Lapidum origine_,\r\nDresden, 1734, translated into German, with excellent notes, Dresden,\r\n1744, by M. C. F. Zimmermann, a pupil of M. Henkel. Holbach's\r\ntranslations seem to have been well received because he writes in\r\nthis preface: \"Je m'estimerai heureux si mon travail peut contribuer à\r\nentretenir et augmenter le goût universel qu'on a conçu pour le saine\r\nphysique.\"\r\n\r\n7. _Oeuvres métallurgiques_ de M. J. C. Orschall, Paris, Hardy, 1760.\r\nOrschall still accepted the old alchemist tradition but was sound in\r\npractice and was the best authority on copper. Holbach does not attempt\r\nto justify his physics which was that of the preceding century. Orschall\r\nwas held in high esteem by Henckel and Stahl.\r\n\r\n8. _Recueil des mémoires des Académies d'Upsal et de Stockholm_, Paris,\r\nDidot, 1764. These records of experiments made in the Royal Laboratories\r\nof Sweden, founded in 1683 by Charles XI, had already been translated\r\ninto German and English. Holbach's translation was made from the German\r\nand Latin. He promises further treatises on Agriculture, Natural History\r\nand Medicine.\r\n\r\n9. _Traité du Soufre_ by G. E. Stahl, Paris, Didot, 1766. In speaking\r\nof Stahl's theories Holbach says: \"Il ne faut pas croire que ces\r\nconnaissances soient des vérités stériles propres seulement à satisfaire\r\nune vaine curiosité, elles ont leur application aux travaux de la\r\nmétallurgie qui leur doivent la perfection où on les a portés depuis\r\nquelques temps.\" Holbach understood very clearly the utility of science\r\nin his scheme of increasing the store of human well-being, and would\r\ndoubtless have translated other useful works had not other interests\r\nprevented. There is a MSS. note of his in the Bibliothèque Nationale to\r\nM. Malesherbes, then Administrateur de la Librairie Royale; suggesting\r\nother German treatises that might well be translated. (MSS. 22194).\r\n\r\n\r\nHOLBACH TO MALESHERBES\r\n\r\n_Monsieur_\r\n\r\nJ'ai l'honneur de vous envoyer ci-joint la liste des ouvrages dont\r\nM. Liège fils pourrait entreprendre la traduction. Je n'en connais\r\nactuellement point d'autres qui méritent l'attention du public. M.\r\nMacquer m'a écrit une lettre qui a pour objet les mêmes choses dont vous\r\nm'avez fait l'honneur de me parler, et je lui fais la même réponse.\r\n\r\nJ'ai l'honneur d'être avec respect, Monsieur,\r\n\r\n Votre très obéissant serviteur\r\n D'HOLBACH\r\nà Paris ce 6 d'avril 1761\r\n\r\n\r\nThe list of books was as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Johann Kunckel's _Laboratorium Chymicum_, 8vo.\r\n\r\n2. Georg Ernest Stahl's _Commentary on Becher's Metallurgy_, 8vo.\r\n\r\n3. _Concordantia Chymica Becheri_, 40º, published by Stahl.\r\n\r\n4. _Cadmologia_, or the _Natural History of Cobalt_, by J. G. Lehmann,\r\nBerlin, 1760, 4°.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter 1760 Holbach became interested in another line of intellectual\r\nactivity, namely the writing and translation of anti-religious\r\nliterature. His first book of this sort really appeared in 1761 although\r\nno copies bear this date. From 1767 on however he published a great\r\nmany works of this character. It is convenient to deal first with his\r\ntranslations of English deistical writers. They are in chronological\r\norder.\r\n\r\n1. _Esprit du clergé, ou le Christianisme primitif vengé des entreprises\r\net des excès de nos Prêtres modernes_. Londres (Amsterdam), 1767. This\r\nbook appeared in England in 1720 under the title of _The Independent\r\nWhig_; its author was Thomas Gordon (known through his Commentaries on\r\nSallust and Tacitus) who wrote in collaboration with John Trenchard. The\r\nbook was partially rewritten by Holbach and then touched up by Naigeon,\r\nwho, according to a manuscript note by his brother, \"atheised it as\r\nmuch as possible.\" It was sold with great secrecy and at a high price--a\r\nreward which the colporters demanded for the risk they ran in peddling\r\nseditious literature. The book was a violent attack on the spirit of\r\ndomination which characterized the Christian priesthood at that time.\r\n\r\n2. _De L'imposture sacerdotale, ou Recueil de Pièces sur le clergé_,\r\nLondres (Amsterdam), 1767. Another edition 1772 under title _De la\r\nMonstruosité pontificale_ etc.\r\n\r\nContains translations of various pamphlets including Davisson, _A\r\ntrue picture of Popery_; Brown, _Popery a Craft_, London 1735; Gordon,\r\n_Apology for the danger of the church_, 1719; Gordon, _The Creed of an\r\nIndependent Whig_, 1720.\r\n\r\n3. _Examen des Prophéties qui servent de fondement à la religion\r\nChrétienne_, Londres (Amsterdam), 1768. Translation of Anthony Collins,\r\n_A Discourse on the Grounds and Reasons of the Christian Religion_,\r\nLondon, 1724. Contains also _The Scheme of literal Prophecy considered_,\r\n1727, also by Collins in answer to the works of Clarke, Sherlock,\r\nChandler, Sykes, and especially to Whiston's _Essay towards restoring\r\nthe text of the Old Testament_, one of the thirty-five works directed\r\nagainst Collins' original _\"Discourse\"_. Copies of this work have become\r\nvery rare.\r\n\r\n4. _David, ou l'histoire de l'homme selon le coeur de Dieu_. Londres\r\n(Amsterdam), 1768. This work appeared in England in 1761 and is\r\nattributed to Peter Annet, also to John Noorthook. Some English\r\neulogists of George II, Messrs. Chandler, Palmer and others, had likened\r\ntheir late King to David, \"the man after God's own heart.\" The deists,\r\nstruck by the absurdity of the comparison, proceeded to relate all\r\nthe scandalous facts they could find recorded of David, and by clever\r\ndistortions painted him as the most execrable of Kings, in a work\r\nentitled _David or the Man after God's Own Heart_, which formed the\r\nbasis of Holbach's translation.\r\n\r\n5. _Les prêtres démasqués ou des iniquités du clergé chrétien_. Londres,\r\n1768. Translation of four discourses published under the title _The\r\nAx laid to the root of Christian Priestcraft by a layman_, London, T.\r\nCooper, 1742. A rare volume.\r\n\r\n6. _Lettres philosophiques..._ Londres (Amsterdam, 1768). Translation\r\nof J. Toland's _Letters to Serena_, London, 1704. The book, which had\r\nbecome very rare in Holbach's time, had caused a great scandal at the\r\ntime of its publication and was much sought after by collectors. It\r\ncontains five letters, the first three of which are by Toland, the other\r\ntwo and the preface by Holbach and Naigeon. The matters treated are,\r\nthe origin of prejudices, the dogma of the immortality of the soul,\r\nidolatry, superstition, the system of Spinoza and the origin of movement\r\nin matter.\r\n\r\nDiderot said of these works, in writing to Mlle. Volland Nov. 22, 1768\r\n(_Oeuvres_, Vol. XVIII, p. 308): \"Il pleut des bombes dans la maison\r\ndu Seigneur. Je tremble toujours que quelqu'un de ces téméraires\r\nartilleurs-là ne s'en trouve mal. Ce sont les _Lettres philosophiques_\r\ntraduites, ou supposées traduites, de l'anglais de Toland; c'est\r\n_l'Examen des prophéties_; c'est la _Vie de David ou de l'homme selon là\r\ncoeur de Dieu_, ce sont mélle diables déchainés.--Ah! Madame de Blacy,\r\nje crains bien que le Fils de l'Homme ne soit à la porte; que la\r\nvenue d'Elie ne soit proche, et que nous ne touchions au règne de\r\nl'Anti-christ. Tous les jours, quand je me lève, je regarde par ma\r\nfenêtre, si la grande prostituée de Babylone ne se promène point déjà\r\ndans les rues avec sa grande coupe à la main et s'il ne se fait aucun\r\ndes signes prédits dans le firmament.\"\r\n\r\n7. _De la Cruauté religieuse_, Londres (Amsterdam). _Considerations\r\nupon war, upon cruelty in general and religious cruelty in particular_,\r\nLondon, printed for Thomas Hope, 1761.\r\n\r\n8. _Dissertation critique sur les tourmens de l'enfer_ printed in\r\nan original work, _L'Enfer détruit_, Londres (Amsterdam), 1769. A\r\ntranslation of Whitefoot's _The Torments of Hell, the foundation and\r\npillars thereof discover'd, search'd, shaken and remov'd_. London, 1658.\r\n\r\n9. In the _Recueil philosophique_ edited by Naigeon, Londres\r\n(Amsterdam), 1770. I. Dissertation sur l'immortalité de l'âme.\r\nTranslated from Hume. II. Dissertation sur le suicide (Hume). III.\r\nExtrait d'un livre Anglais qui a pour titre le Christianisme aussi\r\nancien que le monde. (Tindal, Christianity as old as Creation.)\r\n\r\n10. _Esprit de Judaïsme, ou Examen raisonné de la Loi de Moyse_. Londres\r\n(Amsterdam), 1770 (1769), translated from Anthony Collins. With the\r\nexception of some of Holbach's own works this is one of the fiercest\r\ndenunciations of Judaism and Christianity to be found in print. In fact,\r\nit is very much in the style of Holbach's anti-religious works and shows\r\nbeyond a doubt that Holbach derived his inspiration from Collins and the\r\nmore radical of the English school. The volume has become exceedingly\r\nrare.\r\n\r\nAfter outlining the history of Judaism the book ends thus:\r\n\r\nOse, donc enfin, ô Europe! secouer le joug insupportable des préjugés\r\nqui t'affligent. Laisse à des Hébreux stupides, à des frénétiques\r\nimbéciles, à des Asiatiques lâches et dégradés, ces superstitions aussi\r\navilissantes qu'insensées: elles ne sont point faites pour les habitans\r\nde ton climat. Occupe-toi du soin de perfectionner tes gouvernemens, de\r\ncorriger tes lois, de réformer tes abus, de régler tes moeurs, et ferme\r\npour toujours les yeux à ces vraies chimères, qui depuis tant de siècles\r\nn'ont servi qu'à retarder tes progrès vers la science véritable et à\r\nt'écarter de la route du bonheur.\r\n\r\n11. _Examen critique de la vie et des ouvrages de Saint Paul_, Londres\r\n(Amsterdam), 1770. A free translation of Peter Annet's _History and\r\ncharacter of St. Paul examined_, written in answer to Lyttelton. New\r\nedition 1790 and translated back into English \"from the French of\r\nBoulanger,\" London, R. Carlile, 1823. A rather unsympathetic account,\r\nbut with flashes of real insight into \"le système religieux des\r\nChrétiens dont S. Paul fut évidemment le véritable architecte.\" (Epître\r\ndédicatoire.)\r\n\r\nAnnet said of Paul's type of man \"l'enthousiaste s'enivre, pour l'ainsi\r\ndire, de son propre vin, il se persuade que la cause de ses passions\r\nest la cause de Dieu (p. 72), mais quelque violent qu'ait pu être\r\nl'enthousiasme de S. Paul, il sentait très bien que la doctrine qu'il\r\nprêchait devait paraître bizarre et insensée à des êtres raisonnables\"\r\n(p. 141).\r\n\r\n12. _De la nature humaine, ou Exposition des facultés, des actions et\r\ndes passions de l'âme_, Londres (Amsterdam), 1772. (Thomas Hobbes.)\r\nReprinted in a French Edition of Hobbes' works by Holbach and Sorbière,\r\n1787. Appeared first in English in 1640, omitted in a Latin Edition of\r\nHobbes printed in Amsterdam. In spite of its brevity, Holbach considered\r\nthis one of Hobbes' most important and luminous works.\r\n\r\n13. _Discours sur les Miracles de Jesus Christ_ (Amsterdam, 1780?).\r\nTranslated from Woolston, whom Holbach admired very much for\r\nhis uncompromising attitude toward truth. He suffered fines and\r\nimprisonments, but would not give up the privilege of writing as he\r\npleased. The present discourse was the cause of a quarrel with his\r\nfriend Whiston. He died Jan. 27, 1733, \"avec beaucoup de fermeté...\r\nil se ferma les yeux et la bouche de ses propres mains, et rendit\r\nl'esprit.\" This work exists in a manuscript book of 187 pages, written\r\nvery fine, in the Bibliothèque Nationale (Mss. français 15224) and was\r\ncurrent in France long before 1780. In fact it is mentioned by Grimm\r\nbefore 1770, but the dictionaries (Barber, Quérard) generally date it\r\nfrom 1780.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore turning to Holbach's original works mention should be made of\r\na very interesting and extraordinary book that he brought to light,\r\nretouched, and later used as a kind of shield against the attacks of the\r\nparliaments upon his own works.\r\n\r\nIn 1766 he published a work entitled _L'Antiquité dévoilée par ses\r\nusages, ou Examen critique des principales Opinions, Cérémonies et\r\nInstitutions religieuses et politiques des différens Peuples de la\r\nTerre_. Par feu M. Boulanger, Amsterdam, 1766. This is a work based on\r\nan original manuscript by Boulanger, who died in 1759, preceded by\r\nan excellent letter on him by Diderot, published also in the _Gazette\r\nLittéraire_.\r\n\r\nThe use made by Holbach of Boulanger's name makes it necessary to\r\nconsider for a moment this almost forgotten writer. Nicholas Antoine\r\nBoulanger was born in 1722. As a child he showed so little aptitude for\r\nstudy that later his teachers could scarcely believe that he had turned\r\nout to be a really learned man. As Diderot observes, \"ces exemples\r\nd'enfans, rendus ineptes entre les mains des Pédans qui les abrutissent\r\nen dépit de la nature la plus heureuse, ne sont pas rares, cependant\r\nils surprennent toujours\" (p. 1). Boulanger studied mathematics and\r\narchitecture, became an engineer and was employed by the government as\r\ninspector of bridges and highways. He passed a busy life in exacting\r\noutdoor work but at the same time his active intellect played over a\r\nlarge range of human interests. He became especially concerned with\r\nhistorical origins and set himself to learn Latin and Greek that he\r\nmight get at the sources. Not satisfied that he had come to the root of\r\nthe matter he learned Arabic, Syriac, Hebrew and Chaldean. Diderot\r\nsays \"Il lisait et étudiait partout, je l'ai moi-même rencontré sur\r\nles grandes routes avec un auteur rabinnique à la main.\" He made a\r\n_mappemonde_ in which the globe is divided in two hemispheres, one\r\noccupied by the continents, the other by the oceans, and by a singular\r\ncoincidence he found that the meridian of the continental hemisphere\r\npassed through Paris. Some such rearrangement of hemispheres is one of\r\nthe commonplaces of modern geography. He furnished such articles as,\r\n_Deluge, Corvée, Société_ for the Encyclopedia and wrote several large\r\nand extremely learned books, among them _Recherches sur l'origine du\r\nDespotisme oriental_ and _Antiquité dévoilée_. He died from overwork at\r\nthe age of thirty-seven.\r\n\r\nBoulanger's ideas on philosophy, mythology, anthropology and history are\r\nof extraordinary interest today. Diderot relates his saying--\"Que si la\r\nphilosophie avait trouvé tant d'obstacles parmi nous c'était qu'on avait\r\ncommencé par où il aurait fallu finir, par des maximes abstraites, des\r\nraisonnemens généraux, des réflexions subtiles qui ont révolté par leur\r\nétrangeté et leur hardiesse et qu'on aurait admises sans peine si elles\r\navaient été précédées de l'histoire des faits.\" He carried over this\r\ninductive method into realm of history, which he thought had been\r\napproached from the wrong side, i.e., the metaphysical, \"par consulter\r\nles lumières de la raison\" (p. 8). He continues, \"j'ai pensé qu'il\r\ndevait y avoir quelques circonstances _particulières_. Un fait et non\r\nune spéculation métaphysique m'a toujours semblé devoir être et tribut\r\nnaturel et nécessaire de l'histoire.\" Curiously enough the central fact\r\nin history appeared to Boulanger to be the deluge, and on the basis of\r\nit he attempted to interpret the _Kulturgeschichte_ of humanity. It is\r\na bit unfortunate that he took the deluge quite as literally as he did;\r\nhis idea, however, is obviously the influence of environmental pressure\r\non the changing beliefs and practices of mankind. Under the spell of\r\nthis new point of view, he writes, \"Ce qu'on appelle l'histoire n'en est\r\nque la partie la plus ingrate, la plus uniforme, la plus inutile, quoi\r\nqu'elle soit la plus connue. La véritable histoire est couverte par le\r\nvoile des temps\" (p. 7). Boulanger however was not to be daunted and\r\non the firm foundation of the fact of some ancient and universal\r\ncatastrophe, as recorded on the surface of the earth and in human\r\nmythology, he proceeds to inquire into the moral effects of the changes\r\nin the physical environment back to which if possible the history of\r\nantiquity must be traced. Man's defeat in his struggle with the elements\r\nmade him religious, _hinc prima mali labes_. \"Son premier pas fut un\r\nfaux pas, sa première maxime fut une erreur\" (p. 4 sq). But it was not\r\nhis fault nor has time repaired the evil moral effects of that early\r\ncatastrophe. \"Les grandes révolutions physiques de notre globe sont les\r\nvéritables époques de l'histoire des nations\" (p. 9). Hence have arisen\r\nthe various psychological states through which mankind has passed.\r\nContemporary savages are still in the primitive state--Boulanger\r\nproperly emphasizes the relation of anthropology to history--\"On\r\naperçoit qu'il y a une nouvelle manière de voir et d'écrire l'histoire\r\ndes hommes\" (p. 12) and with a vast store of anthropological and\r\nfolklorist learning he writes it so that his assailant, Fabry d'Autrey,\r\nin his _Antiquité justifiée_ (Paris, 1766) is obliged to say with truth,\r\n\"Ce n'est point ici un tissus de mensonges grossiers, de sophismes\r\nrebattus et bouffons, appliqués d'un air méprisant aux objets les\r\nplus intéressants pour l'humanité. C'est une enterprise sérieuse et\r\nréfléchie\" (p. 11).\r\n\r\nIn 1767 Holbach published his first original work, a few copies of\r\nwhich had been printed in Nancy in 1761. This work was _Le Christianisme\r\ndévoilé ou Examen des principes et des effets de la religion\r\nChrétienne_. Par feu M. Boulanger. Londres (Amsterdam), 1767. There\r\nwere several other editions the same year, one printed at John Wilkes'\r\nprivate press in Westminster. It was reprinted in later collections\r\nof Boulanger's works, and went through several English and Spanish\r\neditions. The form of the title and the attribution of the work to\r\nBoulanger were designed to set persecution on the wrong track. There\r\nhas been some discussion as to its authorship. Voltaire and Laharpe\r\nattributed it to Damilaville, at whose book shop it was said to have\r\nbeen sold, but M. Barbier has published detailed information given him\r\nby Naigeon to the effect that Holbach entrusted his manuscript to M. De\r\nSaint-Lambert, who had it printed by Leclerc at Nancy in 1761. Most\r\nof the copies that got to Paris at that time were bought by several\r\nofficers of the King's regiment then in garrison at Nancy, among them M.\r\nde Villevielle, a friend of Voltaire and of Condorcet. Damilaville did\r\nnot sell a single copy and even had a great deal of trouble to get one\r\nfor Holbach who waited for it a long time. This circumstantial evidence\r\nis of greater value than the statement of Voltaire who was in the habit\r\nof attributing anonymous works to whomever he pleased. [39:2]\r\n\r\nThe edition of 1767 was printed in Amsterdam as were most of Holbach's\r\nworks. We have the details of their publication from Naigeon _cadet_, a\r\ncopyist, whose brother, J. A. Naigeon, was Holbach's literary factotum.\r\nIn a manuscript note in his copy of the _Système de la Nature_ he tells\r\nhow he copied nearly all Holbach's works, either at Paris or at Sedan,\r\nwhere he was stationed, and where his friend Blon, the postmaster, aided\r\nhim, passing the manuscripts on to a Madame Loncin in Liège, who in\r\nturn was a correspondent of Marc-Michel Rey, the printer in Amsterdam.\r\nSometimes they were sent directly by the diligence or through\r\ntravellers. This account agrees perfectly with information given M.\r\nBarbier orally by Naigeon _aîné_. After being printed in Holland the\r\nbooks were smuggled into France _sous le manteau_, as the expression is,\r\nand sold at absurd rates by colporters. [40:3]\r\n\r\nDiderot writing to Falconet early in 1768 [40:4] says: \"Il pleut des\r\nlivres incrédules. C'est un feu roulant qui crible le sanctuaire de\r\ntoutes parts... L'intolérance du gouvernment s'accroit de jour en jour.\r\nOn dirait que c'est un projet formé d'éteindre ici les lettres, de\r\nruiner le commerce de librairie et de nous réduire à la besace et à\r\nla stupidité... _Le Christianisme dévoilé_ s'est vendu jusqu'à quatre\r\nlouis.\"\r\n\r\nWhen caught the colporters were severely punished. Diderot gives\r\nthe following instance in a letter to Mlle. Volland Oct. 8, 1768\r\n(Avézac-Lavigne, _Diderot_, p. 161): \"Un apprenti avait reçu, en payment\r\nou autrement, d'un colporteur appelé Lécuyer, deux exemplaires du\r\n_Christianisme dévoilé_ et il avait vendu un de ces exemplaires à son\r\npatron. Celui-ci le défère au lieutenant de police. Le colporteur, sa\r\nfemme et l'apprenti sont arrêtés tous les trois; ils viennent d'être\r\npiloriés, fouettés et marqués, et l'apprenti condamné à neuf ans de\r\ngalères, le colporteur à cinq ans, et la femme à l'hôpital pour toute sa\r\nvie.\"\r\n\r\nThere are two very interesting pieces of contemporary criticism of _Le\r\nChristianisme dévoilé_, one by Voltaire, the other by Grimm. Voltaire\r\nwrites in a letter to Madame de Saint Julien December 15, 1766\r\n(_Oeuvres_, XLIV, p. 534, ed. Garnier): \"Vous m'apprenez que, dans votre\r\nsociété, on m'attribue _Le Christianisme dévoilé_ par feu M. Boulanger,\r\nmais je vous assure que les gens au fait ne m'attribuent point du tout\r\ncet ouvrage. J'avoue avec vous qu'il y a de la clarté, de la chaleur,\r\net quelque fois de l'éloquence; mais il est plein de répétitions, de\r\nnégligences, de fautes contre la langue et je serais très-fâché de\r\nl'avoir fait, non seulement comme académicien, mais comme philosophe, et\r\nencore plus comme citoyen.\r\n\r\n\"Il est entièrement opposé à mes principes. Ce livre conduit à\r\nl'athéisme que je déteste. J'ai toujours regardé l'athéisme comme le\r\nplus grand égarement de la raison, parce qu'il est aussi ridicule de\r\ndire que l'arrangement du monde ne prouve pas un artisan suprême qu'il\r\nserait impertinent de dire qu'une horloge ne prouve pas un horloger.\r\n\r\n\"Je ne réprouve pas moins ce livre comme citoyen; l'auteur paraît\r\ntrop ennemi des puissances. Des hommes qui penseraient comme lui ne\r\nformeraient qu'une anarchie: et je vois trop, par l'example de Genève,\r\ncombien l'anarchie est à craindre. Ma coutume est d'écrire sur la marge\r\nde mes livres ce que je pense d'eux, vous verrez, quand vous daignerez\r\nvenir à Ferney, les marges de _Christianisme dévoilé_ chargés de\r\nremarques qui montrent que l'auteur s'est trompé sur les faits les plus\r\nessentiels.\" These notes may be read in Voltaire's works (Vol. XXXI, p.\r\n129, ed. Garnier) and the original copy of _Le Christianisme dévoilé_\r\nin which he wrote them is in the British Museum (c 28, k 3) where it\r\nis jealously guarded as one of the most precious autographs of the\r\nPatriarch of Ferney.\r\n\r\nGrimm's notice is from the _Correspondance Littéraire_ of August 15,\r\n1763 (Vol. V, p. 367). \"Il existe un livre intitulé _le Christianisme\r\ndévoilé ou Examen des principes et des effets de la religion\r\nChrétienne_, par feu M. Boulanger, volume in 8º. On voit d'abord qu'on\r\nlui a donné ce titre pour en faire le pendant de _l'Antiquité dévoilée_;\r\nmais il ne faut pas beaucoup se connaître en manière pour sentir que ces\r\ndeux ouvrages ne sont pas sortis de la même plume. On peut assurer\r\navec la même certitude que celui dont nous parlons ne vient point de la\r\nfabrique de Ferney, parce que j'aimerais mieux croire que le patriache\r\neût pris la lune avec ses dents; cela serait moins impossible que de\r\nguetter sa manière et son allure si complètement qu'il n'en restât\r\naucune trace quelconque. Par la même raison, je ne crois ce livre\r\nd'aucun de nos philosophes connus, parce que je n'y trouve la manière\r\nd'aucun de ceux qui ont écrit. D'òu vient-il donc? Ma foi, je serais\r\nfâché de le savoir, et je crois que l'auteur aura sagement fait de ne\r\nmettre personne dans son secret. C'est le livre le plus hardi et le\r\nplus terrible qui ait jamais parti dans aucun lieu du monde. La\r\npréface consiste dans une lettre où l'auteur examine si la réligion est\r\nreéllement nécessaire ou seulement utile au maintien ou à la police des\r\nempires, et s'il convient de la respecter sous ce point de vue. Comme\r\nil établit la négative, il entreprend en conséquence de prouver, par\r\nson ouvrage, l'absurdité et l'incohérence du dogme Chrétien et de la\r\nmythologie qui en résulte, et l'influence de cette absurdité sur les\r\ntêtes et sur les âmes. Dans la seconde partie, il examine la morale\r\nchrétienne, et il prétend prouver que dans ses principes généraux elle\r\nn'a aucun avantage sur toutes les morales du monde, parce que la justice\r\net la bonté sont recommandées dans tous les catéchismes de l'univers, et\r\nque chez aucun peuple, quelque barbare qu'il fut, on n'a jamais\r\nenseigné qu'il fallût être injuste et méchant. Quant à ce que la morale\r\nchrétienne a de particulier, l'auteur pretend démontrer qu'elle ne peut\r\nconvenir qu'à des enthousiastes peu propres aux devoirs de la société,\r\npour lesquels les hommes sont dans ce monde. Il entreprend de prouver,\r\ndans la troisième partie, que la religion chrétienne a eu les effets\r\npolitiques les plus sinistres et les plus funestes, et que le genre\r\nhumain lui doit tous les malheurs dont il a été accablé depuis quinze à\r\ndix-huit siècles, sans qu'on en puisse encore prévoir la fin.\r\n\r\nCe livre est écrit avec plus de véhémence que de véritable éloquence;\r\nil entraine. Son style est châtié et correct, quoique un peu dur et\r\nsec; son ton est grave et soutenu. On n'y apprend rien de nouveau, et\r\ncependant il attache et intéresse. Malgré son incroyable témérité, on\r\nne peut refuser à l'auteur la qualité d'homme de bien fortement épris du\r\nbonheur de sa race et de la prospérité des sociétés; mais je pense que\r\nses bonnes intentions seraient une sauvegarde bien faible contre les\r\nmandements et les réquisitions.\" This is a clear and fair account of\r\na book that is without doubt the severest criticism of the theory and\r\npractice of historical Christianity ever put in print.\r\n\r\nThe church very naturally did not let such a book pass unanswered. Abbé\r\nBergier, a heavy person, triumphantly refuted Holbach in eight hundred\r\npages in his _Apologia de la Religion Chrétienne contre l'Auteur du\r\nChristianisme dévoilé_, Paris, 1769, which finishes with the fatal\r\nprophecy, \"Nous avons de surs garans de nos espérances: tant que le sang\r\nauguste de S. Louis sera sur le trône, _il n'y a point de révolutions\r\nà craindre ni dans la Religion ni dans la politique_. La religion\r\nChrétienne fondée sur la parole de Dieu... triomphera des nouveaux\r\nPhilosophes. Dieu qui veille sur son ouvrage n'a pas besoin de nos\r\nfaibles mains pour le soutenir\" (Psaume 32, vs. 10, 11).\r\n\r\n2. There already existed in 1767 another work by Holbach entitled\r\n_Théologie portative ou Dictionnaire Abrégé de la Religion Chrétienne.\r\nPar Mr Abbé Bernier_. Londres (Amsterdam), 1768 (1767). This book\r\nwent through many editions and was augmented by subsequent authors and\r\neditors. Voltaire was already writing to d'Alembert about it August 14,\r\n1767. [44:5]\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Damilaville, October 16, he writes (Vol. XIV, p. 406):\r\n\r\nDepuis trois mois il y a une douzaine d'ouvrages d'une liberté\r\nextrême, imprimés en Hollande. _La Théologie portative_ n'est nullement\r\nthéologique: ce n'est qu'une plaisanterie continuelle par ordre\r\nalphabétique; mais il faut avouer qu'il y a des traits si comiques que\r\nplusieurs théologiens mêmes ne pourront s'empêcher d'en rire. Les jeunes\r\ngens et les femmes lisent cette folie avec avidité. Les éditions de tous\r\nles livres dans ce goût se multiplient.\r\n\r\nAnd on February 8, 1768, he wrote:\r\n\r\nOn fait tous les jours des livres contre la religion, dont je voudrais\r\nbien imiter le style pour la défendre. Y a-t-il de plus salé, que la\r\nplupart des traits qui se trouvent dans la _Théologie portative_? Y\r\na-t-il rien de plus vigoreux, de plus profondément raisonné, d'écrit\r\navec une éloquence plus audacieuse et plus terrible, que le _Militaire\r\nphilosophe_, ouvrage qui court toute l'Europe? [by Naigeon and Holbach]\r\nLisez la _Théologie portative_, et vous ne pourrez vous empêcher\r\nde rire, en condammant la coupable hardiesse de l'auteur. Lisez\r\n_l'Imposture sacerdotale_--vous y verrez le style de Démosthène. Ces\r\nlivres malheuresement inondent l'Europe; mais quelle est la cause\r\nde cette inondation? Il n'y en a point d'autre que les querelles\r\nthéologiques qui ont révolté les laïques. _Il s'est fait une révolution\r\ndans l'esprit humain que rien ne peut plus arrêter: les persécutions ne\r\npourraient qu'irriter le mal_. [Footnote: the italics are mine.]\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted however that Voltaire's sentiments varied according to\r\nthe point of view of the person to whom he was writing. In a letter to\r\nd'Alembert, May 24, 1769 (Vol. LXV, p. 453), he calls the _Théologie\r\nportative_ \"un ouvrage à mon gré, très plaisant, auquel je n'ai\r\nassurément nulle part, ouvrage que je serais très fâché d'avoir fait, et\r\nque je voudrais bien avoir été capable de faire.\" But in a letter to the\r\nBishop of Annecy June, 1769, he writes (Vol. XXVIII, p. 73): \"Vous lui\r\n[M. de Saint Florentin] imputez, à ce que je vois par vos lettres, des\r\nlivres misérables, et jusqu'à _la Theologie portative_, ouvrage fait\r\napparemment dans quelque cabaret; vous n'êtes pas obligé d'avoir du\r\ngoût, mais vous êtes obligé d'être juste\" (Vol. XXVIII, p. 73).\r\nDiderot even said of the book: \"C'est un assez bon nombre de bonnes\r\nplaisanteries noyées dans un beaucoup plus grand nombre de mauvaises\"\r\nand this criticism is just. A few examples of the better jokes will\r\nsuffice:\r\n\r\n_Adam:_ C'est le premier homme, Dieu en fait un grand nigaud, qui pour\r\ncomplaire à sa femme eut la bêtise de mordre dans une pomme que ses\r\ndescendans n'ont point encore pu digérer.\r\n\r\n_Idées Innées:_ Notions inspirées des Prêtres de si bonne heure, si\r\nsouvent répétées, que devenu grand l'on croît les avoir eu toujours ou\r\nles avoir reçus dès le ventre de sa mère.\r\n\r\n_Jonas:_ La baleine fut à la fin obligée de le vomir tant un Prophète\r\nest un morceau difficile à digérer.\r\n\r\n_Magie:_ Il y en a de deux sortes, la blanche et la noire. La première\r\nest très sainte et se pratique journellement dans l'église.\r\n\r\n_Protestants:_ Chrétiens amphibies.\r\n\r\n_Vierge:_ C'est la mère du fils de Dieu et belle-mère de l'église.\r\n\r\n_Visions:_ Lanternes magiques que de tout temps le Père Eternel s'est\r\namusé à montrer aux Saintes et aux Prophètes.\r\n\r\n3. Holbach furnished the last chapter of Naigeon's book _Le Militaire\r\nphilosophe, ou Difficulties sur la religion_, Londres (Amsterdam), 1768.\r\nVoltaire ascribed the work to St. Hyacinthe. Grimm recognized that the\r\nlast chapter was by another hand and considered it the weakest part of\r\nthe book. It attempts to demonstrate that all supernatural religions\r\nhave been harmful to society and that the only useful religion is\r\nnatural religion or morals. The book was refuted by Guidi, in a \"_Lettre\r\na M. le Chevalier de... [Barthe] entraîné dans l'irreligion par un\r\nlibelle intitulé Le Militaire philosophe_ (1770, 12mo).\r\n\r\n4. Holbach's next book was _La Contagion sacrée ou l'Histoire naturelle\r\nde la Superstition_, Londres (Amsterdam), 1768. In his preface Holbach\r\nattributed the alleged English original of this work to John Trenchard\r\nbut that was only a ruse to avoid persecution. The book is by Holbach.\r\nIt has gone through many editions and been translated into English and\r\nSpanish. The first edition had an introduction by Naigeon. According\r\nto him manuscripts of this book became quite rare at one time and were\r\nsupposed to have been lost. Later they became more common and this\r\nedition was corrected by collation with six others.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [PG transcriber's note: at this point there appears to be a break\r\n     in the original text.  A sentence introducing the fifth book in\r\n     this list, \"Letters to Eugenie\", has evidently been lost.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letters were written in 1764, according to Lequinio (_Feuilles\r\nposthumes_), who had his information from Naigeon, to Marguerite,\r\nMarchioness de Vermandois in answer to a very touching and pitiful\r\nletter from that lady who was in great trouble over religion. Her young\r\nhusband was a great friend of the Holbachs, but having had a strict\r\nCatholic bringing up she was shocked at their infidelity and warned by\r\nher confessor to keep away from them. \"Yet in their home she saw all\r\nthe domestic virtues exemplified and beheld that sweet and unchangeable\r\naffection for which the d'Holbachs were eminently distinguished among\r\ntheir acquaintances and which was remarkable for its striking contrast\r\nwith the courtly and Christian habits of the day. Her natural good\r\nsense and love for her friends struggled with her monastic education and\r\nreverence for the priests. The conflict rendered her miserable and she\r\nreturned to her country seat to brood over it. In this state of mind she\r\nat length wrote to the Baron and laid open her situation requesting him\r\nto comfort, console, and enlighten her.\" [47:7] His letters accomplished\r\nthe desired effect and he later published them in the hope that they\r\nwould do as much for others. They were carefully revised before they\r\nwere sent to the press. All the purely personal passages were omitted\r\nand others added to hide the identity of the persons concerned. Letters\r\nof the sort to religious ladies were common at this time. Fréret's were\r\npreventive, Holbach's curative, but appear to be rather strong dose\r\nfor a _dévote_. Other examples are Voltaire's _Epître à Uranie_ and\r\nDiderot's _Entretien d'un Philosophe avec la Maréchale de..._.\r\n\r\n6. In 1769 Holbach published two short treatises on the doctrine of\r\neternal punishment which claimed to be translations from English, but\r\nthe originals are not to be found. The titles are _De l'intolérance\r\nconvaincue de crime et de folie_ as it is sometimes given, and--\r\n\r\n7. _L'Enfer détruit ou Examen raisonné du Dogme de l'Eternité des\r\nPeines_. Londres, Amsterdam, 1769. This letter was translated into\r\nEnglish under the title _Hell Destroyed!_ \"Now first translated from the\r\nFrench of d'Alembert without any mutilations,\" London 1823, which led\r\nMr. J. Hibbert to say, \"I know not why English publishers attribute this\r\nawfully sounding work to the cautious, not to say timid d'Alembert. It\r\nwas followed by Whitefoot's _'Torments of Hell,'_ now first translated\r\nfrom the French.\" [47:8]\r\n\r\n\r\nOf Holbach's remaining works on religion two, _Histoire critique de\r\nJésus Christ_ and _Tableau des Saints_, date from 1770 when he began to\r\npublish his more philosophical works.\r\n\r\n8. The _Histoire critique de Jésus Christ ou Analyse raisonnée des\r\nEvangiles_ was published without name of place or date. It was preceded\r\nby Voltaire's _Epître à Uranie_. It is an extremely careful but\r\nunsympathetic analysis of the Gospel accounts, emphasizing all the\r\ninconsistencies and interpreting them with a literalness that they\r\ncan ill sustain. From this rationalistic view-point Holbach found the\r\nGospels a tissue of absurdities and contradictions. His method, however,\r\nwould not be followed by the critique of today.\r\n\r\n9. The _Tableau des Saints_ is a still more severe criticism of the\r\nheroes of Christendom. Holbach's proposition is \"La raison ne connaît\r\nqu'une mesure pour juger et les hommes et les choses, c'est l'utilité\r\nréelle et permanente, qui en résulte pour notre espèce,\" (p. 111).\r\nJudged by this standard, the saints with their eyes fixed on another\r\nworld have fallen far short. \"Ils se flattèrent de mériter le ciel en\r\nse rendant parfaitement inutile à la terre\" (p. xviii). Holbach much\r\nprefers the heroes of classical antiquity. The book is violent but\r\nlearned throughout, and deals not only with the Jewish patriarchs from\r\nMoses on but with the church fathers and Christian Princes down to the\r\ncontemporary defenders of the faith. After a rather one-sided account\r\nof the most dreary characters and events in Christian history,\r\nHolbach concludes: \"Tel fut, tel est, et tel sera toujours l'esprit du\r\nChristianisme: il est aisé de sentir qu'il est incompatible avec les\r\nprincipes les plus évidens de la morale et de la saine politique\" (p.\r\n208).\r\n\r\n10. In _Recueil philosophique_, Londres (Amsterdam), 1770, edited by\r\nNaigeon. Réflexions sur les craintes de la Mort. Problème important--La\r\nReligion est-elle nécessaire à la morale et utile à la Politique. Par M.\r\nMirabaud.\r\n\r\n11. _Essai sur les préjugés, ou De l'influence des opinions sur les\r\nmoeurs et sur le bonheur des Hommes_. Londres (Amsterdam), 1770, under\r\nname of Dumarsais. The book pretended to be an elaboration of Dumarsais'\r\nessay on the _Philosophe_ published in the _Nouvelles libertés de\r\npenser_, 1750.\r\n\r\nThe special interest connected with it was the refutation Frederick the\r\nGreat published under the title _Examen de l'Essai sur les préjugés_,\r\nLondres, Nourse, 1770 (16 mo). The King of Prussia writing from the\r\npoint of view of a practical, enlightened despot, took special exception\r\nto Holbach's remarks on government. \"Il l'outrage avec autant de\r\ngrossièreté que d'indécence, il force le gouvernement de prendre fait et\r\ncause avec l'église pour s'opposer à l'ennemi commun. Mais, quand avec\r\nun acharnement violent et les traits de la plus âcre satire, il calomnie\r\nson Roi et le gouvernement de son pays, on le prend pour un frénétique\r\nechappé de ses chaînes, et livré aux transports les plus violens de\r\nsa rage. Quoi, Monsieur le philosophe, protecteur des moeurs et de\r\nla vertu, ignorez vous qu'un bon citoyen doit respecter la forme de\r\ngouvernement sous laquelle il vit, ignorez vous qu'il ne convient point\r\nà un particulier d'insulter les Puissances...\" (p. 28).\r\n\r\n\"Non content d'insulter à toutes les têtes couronnés de l'Europe, notre\r\nphilosophe s'amuse, en passant, à répandre du ridicule sur les ouvrages\r\nde Hugo Grotius. J'oserais croire qu'il n'en sera pas cru sur sa\r\nparole, et que le _Droit de la guerre et de la paix_ ira plus loin à la\r\npostérité que _l'Essai sur les préjugés_\" (p. 39).\r\n\r\nHolbach in his anti-militaristic enthusiasm had used the words\r\n\"bourreaux mercenaires\"; \"epithète élégante,\" continues Frederick,\r\n\"dont il honore les guerriers. Mais souffrions nous qu'un cerveau brûlé\r\ninsulte au plus noble emploi de la Societé?\" (p.49). He goes on to\r\ndefend war in good old-fashioned terms. \"Vous déclamez contre la guerre,\r\nelle est funeste en elle-même; mais c'est un mal comme ces autres\r\nfléaux du ciel qu'il faut supposer nécessaires dans l'arrangement de cet\r\nunivers parce qu'ils arrivent périodiquement et qu'aucun siècle n'a pu\r\njusqu'à présent d'en avoir été exempt. J'ai prouvé que de tout temps\r\nl'erreur a dominé dans ce monde; et comme une chose aussi constante peut\r\nêtre envisagée comme une loi général de la nature, j'en conclus que ce\r\nqui a été toujours sera toujours le même\" (p. 19).\r\n\r\nFrederick sent his little refutation to Voltaire for his compliments\r\nwhich were forthcoming. A few days after Voltaire wrote to d'Alembert:\r\n\r\nLe roi de Prusse vous a envoyé, sans doute, son petit écrit contre un\r\nlivre imprimé cette année, intitulé _Essai sur les préjugés_, ce roi a\r\naussi les siens, qu'il faut lui pardonner; on n'est pas roi pour rien.\r\nMais je voudrais savoir quel est l'auteur de cet _Essai_ contre lequel\r\nsa majesté prussienne s'amuse à écrire un peu durement. Serait-il de\r\nDiderot? serait-il de Damilaville? serait-il d'Helvetius? peut-être ne\r\nle connaissez-vous point, je le crois imprimé en Hollande (Vol. LXVI, p.\r\n304).\r\n\r\nD'Alembert answered:\r\n\r\nOui, le roi de Prusse m'a envoyé son écrit contre _l'Essai sur les\r\npréjugés_. Je ne suis point étonné que ce prince n'ait pas goûté\r\nl'ouvrage; je l'ai lu depuis cette réfutation et il m'a paru bien long,\r\nbien monotone et trop amer. Il me semble que ce qu'il y de bon dans ce\r\nlivre aurait pu et dû être noyé dans moins de pages et je vois que vous\r\nen avez porté à peu près le même jugement (Vol. LXVI, p. 324).\r\n\r\nIn spite of these unfavorable judgments the _Essai_ was reprinted\r\nas late as 1886 by the Bibliotheque Nationale in its _Collection des\r\nmeilleurs auteurs anciens et modernes_, still attributed to Dumarsais\r\nwith the account of his life by \"le citoyen Daube\" which graced the\r\nedition of the year I. (1792)\r\n\r\n12. Early in 1770 appeared Holbach's most famous book, the _Système de\r\nla Nature_, the only book that is connected with his name in the minds\r\nof most historians and philosophers. It seems wiser, however, to deal\r\nwith this work in a chapter apart and continue the account of his later\r\npublications.\r\n\r\n13. The next of which was _Le bon-sens, ou idées naturelles opposées\r\naux idées surnaturelles. Par l'Auteur du Système de la Nature_, Londres\r\n(Amsterdam), 1772. This work has gone through twenty-five editions or\r\nmore and has been translated into English, German, Italian and Spanish.\r\nAs early as 1791 it began to be published under the name of the curé\r\nJean Meslier d'Etrépigny, made so famous by Voltaire's publication of\r\nwhat was supposed to be his last will and testament in which on his\r\ndeath bed he abjured and cursed Christianity. Some editions contain in\r\nthe preface Letters by Voltaire and his sketch of Jean Meslier. The\r\nlast reprint was by De Laurence, Scott & Co., Chicago, 1910. The book\r\nis nothing more or less than the _Système de la Nature_, in a greatly\r\nreduced and more readable form.\r\n\r\nVoltaire, to whom it was attributed by some, said to d'Alembert, \"Il y\r\na plus que du bon sens dans ce livre, il est terrible. S'il sort de la\r\nboutique du _Système de la Nature_, l'auteur s'est bien perfectionné.\"\r\nD'Alembert answered: \"Je pense comme vous sur le _Bon-sens_ qui me\r\nparaît un bien plus terrible livre que le _Système de la Nature_.\" These\r\nremarks were inscribed by Thomas Jefferson on the title page of his copy\r\nof _Bon-sens_. The book has gone through several editions in the United\r\nStates and was sold at a popular price. The German translation was\r\npublished in Baltimore on the basis of a copy found in a second-hand\r\nbook store in New Orleans. The most serious work written against it is\r\na long and carefully written treatise against materialism by an Italian\r\nmonk, Gardini, entitled _L'anima umana e sue proprietà dedotte da\r\nsoli principi de ragione, dal P. lettore D. Antonmaria Gardini, monaco\r\ncamaldalese, contro i materialisti e specialmente contro l'opera\r\nintitulata, le Bon-Sens, ou Idées Naturelles opposées aux idées\r\nSurnaturelles. In Padova MDCCLXXXI Nella stamperia del Seminario.\r\nAppresso Giovanni Manfré, Con Licenza de Superiori e Privilegio_ (8vo,\r\np. xx + 284).\r\n\r\n14. In 1773 Holbach published his _Recherches sur les Miracles_, a much\r\nmore sober work than his previous writings on religion. In this book he\r\nraises the well known difficulties with belief in miracles and brings\r\na great deal of real learning and logic to bear on the question. The\r\nentire work is in a reasonable and philosophic spirit. His conclusion\r\nis that \"une vraie religion doit avoir au défaut de bonnes raisons, des\r\npreuves sensibles, capables de faire impression sur tout ceux qui la\r\ncherchent de bonne foi. Ce ne sont pas les miracles.\" The same year he\r\npublished two serious but somewhat tiresome works on politics.\r\n\r\n15. _La politique naturelle_.\r\n\r\n16. _Système social_ in which he attempts to reduce government to the\r\nnaturalistic principles which were the basis of his entire philosophy.\r\nThe first is also attributed to Malesherbes. There is a long and keen\r\ncriticism of the _Système Social_ by Mme. d'Epinay in a letter to Abbé\r\nGaliani Jan. 12, 1773 (Gal. _Corresp._, Vol. II, p. 167).\r\n\r\nBut the most interesting reaction upon it was that of the Abbé Richard\r\nwho criticized it from point of view of the divine right of kings in\r\nhis long and tiresome work entitled _La Défense de la religion, de\r\nla morale, de la vertu, de la politique et de la société, dans la\r\nréfutation des ouvrages qui ont pour titre, l'un Système Social etc.\r\nVautre La Politique Naturelle par le R. P. Ch. L. Richard, Professeur de\r\nThéologie_, etc., Paris, Moulard, 1775.\r\n\r\nIn a preface of forty-seven pages the fears of the conservative old\r\nAbbé are well expressed. The aim of these modern philosophers who are\r\npoisoning public opinion by their writings is to \"démolir avec l'antique\r\nédifice de la religion chrétienne, celui des moeurs, de la vertu, de la\r\nsaine politique etc. rompre tous les canaux de communication entre la\r\nterre et le ciel, bannir, exterminer du monde le Dieu qui le tira du\r\nnéant, y introduire l'impiété la plus complète, la licence la plus\r\nconsomnée, l'anarchie la plus entière, la confusion la plus horrible.\"\r\n\r\n17. Holbach's next work, _Ethocratie ou Gouvernement fondé sur la\r\nMorale_, Amsterdam, Rey, 1776, is interesting mainly for its unfortunate\r\ndedication and peroration, inscribed to Louis XVI, who was hailed\r\ntherein as a long expected Messiah.\r\n\r\n18. Holbach's last works dealt exclusively with morals. They are _La\r\nmorale universelle ou les devoirs de l'homme fondés sur la nature_,\r\nAmsterdam, 1771, and\r\n\r\n19. A posthumous work, _Elements de la Morale universelle, ou catechisme\r\nde la nature_, Paris, 1790. This is a beautiful little book. It\r\nis simple and clear to the last degree. There have been several\r\ntranslations in Spanish for the purposes of elementary education\r\nin morals in the public schools. It was composed in 1765. Holbach's\r\nattitude towards morals is indicated by his _Avertissement_--\"La morale\r\nest une science dont les principes sont susceptibles d'une démonstration\r\naussi claire et aussi rigoureuse que ceux du calcul et de la géometrie.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. THE SYSTÈME DE LA NATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in 1770 appeared the famous _Système de la Nature, ou Des Loix du\r\nMonde Physique et du Monde Morale, Par M. Mirabaud, Secrétaire Perpétuel\r\net l'un des Quarante de l'Académie Française_, Londres (Amsterdam),\r\n1770. This work has gone through over thirty editions in France, Spain,\r\nGermany, England and the United States. No book of a philosophic or\r\nscientific character has ever caused such a sensation at the time of its\r\npublication, excepting perhaps Darwin's _Origin of Species_, the thesis\r\nof which is more than hinted at by Holbach. There were several editions\r\nin 1770. A very few copies contain a _Discours préliminaire de l'Auteur_\r\nof sixteen pages which Naigeon had printed separately in London. The\r\n_Abrégé du Code de la Nature_, which ends the book was also published\r\nseparately and is sometimes attributed to Diderot, 8vo, 16 pp. [54:1]\r\n\r\nThere is also a book entitled _Le vrai sens du Système de la Nature_,\r\n1774, attributed to Helvetius, a very clear, concise epitome largely in\r\nHolbach's own short and telling sentences, and much more effective than\r\nthe original because of its brevity. Holbach himself reproduced the\r\n_Système de la Nature_ in a shortened form in _Bon-sens_, 1772, and\r\nPayrard plagiarized it freely in _De la Nature et de ses Lois_, Paris,\r\n1773. The book has been attributed to Diderot, Helvetius, Robinet,\r\nDamilaville and others. Naigeon is certain that it is entirely by\r\nHolbach, although it is generally held that Diderot had a hand in it.\r\nIt was published under the name of Mirabaud to obviate persecution. The\r\nmanuscript, it was alleged, had been found among his papers as a sort\r\nof \"testament\" or philosophical legacy to posterity. This work may be\r\ncalled the bible of scientific materialism and dogmatic atheism. Nothing\r\nbefore or since has ever approached it in its open and unequivocal\r\ninsistence on points of view commonly held, if at all, with reluctance\r\nand reserve. It is impossible in a study of this length to deal fully\r\nwith the attacks and refutations that were published immediately. We may\r\nmention first the condemnation of the book by the _Parlement de\r\nParis_, August 18, 1770, to be burned by the public hangman along\r\nwith Voltaire's _Dieu et les Hommes_, and Holbach's _Discours sur les\r\nMiracles_, _La Contagion sacrée_ and _le Christianisme dévoilé_, which\r\nhad already been condemned on September 24, 1769. [55:2]\r\n\r\nThe _Réquisitoire_ of Seguier, _avocat général_, on the occasion of the\r\ncondemnation of the _Système de la Nature_ was so weak and ridiculous\r\nthat the _Parlement de Paris_ refused to sanction its publication, and\r\nit was printed by the express order of the King. As Grimm observed,\r\nit seemed designed solely to acquaint the ignorant with this dangerous\r\nwork, without opposing any of its propositions. One would look in vain\r\nfor a better example of the conservatism of the legal profession. [55:3]\r\n\r\nLe poison des nouveautés profanes ne peut corrompre la sainte gravité\r\ndes moeurs qui caractérise les vrais Magistrats: tout peut changer\r\nautour d'eux, _ils restent immuables avec la loi_ (page 496).\r\n\r\nN'est-ce pas ce fatal abus de la liberté de penser, qui a enfanté cette\r\nmultitude de sectes, d'opinions, de partis, et cet esprit d'indépendance\r\ndont d'autres nations ont éprouvé les sinstres révolutions. Le même\r\nabus produira en France des effets peut-être plus funestes. La liberté\r\nindéfinie trouveroit, dans la caractère de la nation, dans son activité,\r\ndans son amour pour la nouveauté, un moyen de plus pour préparer les\r\nplus affreuses révolutions (p. 498).\r\n\r\nThe most interesting private attacks on the _Système de la Nature_\r\ncame from two somewhat unexpected quarters, from Ferney and Sans Souci.\r\nVoltaire, as usual, was not wholly consistent in his opinions of it, as\r\nis revealed in his countless letters on the subject. Grimm attributed\r\nhis hostility to jealousy, and the fear that the _Système de la Nature_\r\nmight \"renverse le rituel de Ferney et que le patriarcat ne s'en aille\r\nau diable avec lui.\" [56:4] George Leroy went so far as to write a book\r\nentitled _Réflexions sur la jalousie, pour servir de commentaire aux\r\nderniers ouvrages de M. de Voltaire_, 1772. Frederick II naturally felt\r\nbound to defend the kings who, as Voltaire said, were no better treated\r\nthan God in the _Système de la Nature_. [56:5]\r\n\r\nVoltaire's correspondence during this period is so interesting that it\r\nseems worth while to quote at length, especially from his letters to\r\nFredrick the Great. In May 1770, shortly after the publication of the\r\n_Système de la Nature_ Voltaire wrote to M. Vernes: [56:6] \"On a tant\r\ndit de sottises sur la nature que je ne lis plus aucun de ces livres\r\nlà.\" But by July he had read it and wrote to Grimm: [56:7] \"Si l'ouvrage\r\neut été plus serré il aurait fait un effet terrible, mais tel qu'il est\r\nil en a fait beaucoup. Il est bien plus éloquent que Spinoza... J'ai\r\nune grande curiosité de savoir ce qu'on en pense à Paris.\" In writing\r\nto d'Alembert about this time he seemed to have a fairly favorable\r\nimpression of the book. \"Il m'a paru qu'il y avait des longueurs, des\r\nrépétitions et quelques inconséquences, mais il y a trop de bon pour\r\nqu'on n'éclate avec fureur contre ce livre. Si on garde le silence, ce\r\nsera une preuve du prodigieux progrès que la tolérance fait tous les\r\njours.\" [57:8] But there was little likelihood that philosophers or\r\ntheologians would keep silent about this scandalous book. Before the end\r\nof the month Voltaire was writing to d'Alembert about his own and\r\nthe king of Prussia's refutations of it, and the same day wrote to\r\nFrederick: \"Il me semble que vos remarques doivent être imprimées; ce\r\nsont des leçons pour le genre humain. Vous soutenez d'un bras la cause\r\nde Dieu et vous écrasez de l'autre la superstition.\" [57:9] Later\r\nVoltaire confessed to Frederick that he also had undertaken to rebuke\r\nthe author of the Système de la Nature. \"Ainsi Dieu a pour lui les deux\r\nhommes les moins superstitieux de l'Europe, ce que devrait lui plaire\r\nbeaucoup\" (p. 390).\r\n\r\nFrederick, however, hesitated to make his refutation public, and wrote\r\nto Voltaire: \"Lorsque j'eus achevé mon ouvrage contre l'athéisme, je\r\ncrus ma réfutation très orthodoxe, je la relus, et je la trouvai bien\r\néloignée de l'être. Il y a des endroits qui ne saurait paraître sans\r\neffaroucher les timides et scandaliser les dévots. Un petit mot qui\r\nm'est échappé sur l'éternité du monde me ferait lapider dans votre\r\npatrie, si j'y étais né particulier, et que je l'eusse fait imprimer.\r\nJe sens que je n'ai point du tout ni l'âme ni le style théologique.\"\r\n[57:10] Voltaire, in his \"petite drôlerie en faveur de la Divinité\"\r\n(as he called his work) and in his letters, could not find terms harsh\r\nenough in which to condemn the _Système de la Nature_. He called it \"un\r\nchaos, un grand mal moral, un ouvrage de ténèbres, un péché contre la\r\nnature, un système de la folie et de l'ignorance,\" and wrote to Delisle\r\nde Sales: \"Je ne vois pas que rien ait plus avili notre siècle que\r\ncette énorme sottise.\" [58:11] Voltaire seemed to grow more bitter about\r\nHolbach's book as time went on. His letters and various works abound in\r\nreferences to it, and it is difficult to determine his motives. He was\r\naccused, as has been suggested, by Holbach's circle \"de caresser les\r\ngens en place, et d'abandonner ceux qui n'y sont plus.\" [58:12] M.\r\nAvenel believed that he suspected Holbach himself of making these\r\naccusations. Voltaire's letter to the Duc de Richelieu, Nov. 1, 1770,\r\n[58:13] seems to give them foundation.\r\n\r\nA very different reaction was that of Goethe and his university circle\r\nat Strasburg to whom the _Système de la Nature_ appeared a harmless\r\nand uninteresting book, \"grau,\" \"cimmerisch,\" \"totenhaft,\" \"die echte\r\nQuintessenz der Greisenheit.\" To these fervent young men in the youthful\r\nflush of romanticism, its sad, atheistic twilight seemed to cast a\r\nveil over the beauty of the earth and rob the heaven of stars; and\r\nthey lightheardedly discredited both Holbach and Voltaire in favor of\r\nShakespeare and the English romantic school. One would look far for a\r\nbetter instance of the romantic reaction which set in so soon and so\r\nobscured the clarity of the issues at stake in the eighteenth century\r\nthought.

X. von, Unumstossliche Widerlegung des\r\nMaterialismus gegen den Verfasser des _Systems der Natur_.

Morley finds Voltaire very\r\nweak and much beside the point, especially in his discussion of order\r\nand disorder in nature which Holbach had denied. Voltaire's argument is\r\nthat there must be an intelligent motor or cause behind nature (p. 7).\r\nThis is God (p. 8). He admits at the outset that all systems are mere\r\ndreams but he continues to insist with a dogmatism equal to Holbach's on\r\nthe validity of his dream. He repeatedly asserts without foundation that\r\nHolbach's system is based on the false experiment of Needham (pp. 5,\r\n6), and even goes so far as to ridicule the evolutionary hypothesis\r\naltogether (p. 6). He speaks of the necessity of a belief in God, by\r\na kind of natural logic. God and matter exist in the nature of things,\r\n\"Tout nous announce un Être suprême, rien ne nous dit ce qu'il est.\" God\r\nhimself seems to be a kind of fatalistic necessity. \"C'est ce que vous\r\nappellerez Nature et c'est ce que j'appelle Dieu.\" At the end he shifts\r\nthe argument from the base of necessity to that of utility. Which is the\r\nmore consoling doctrine? If the idea of God has prevented ten crimes\r\nI hold that the entire world should embrace it (p. 27). As Morley has\r\nsaid, such arguments could scarcely have convinced Voltaire himself.\r\n\r\nFrederick was surprised that Voltaire and D'Alembert had found anything\r\ngood in the book. His refutation was more methodical than that of\r\nVoltaire, who called it a \"homage to the Divinity\" but wrote to\r\nD'Alembert that it was written in the style of a notary. Two other\r\nrefutations emanating from the Academy of Berlin were those of Castillon\r\nand Holland. The first of these is a very heavy and learned work,\r\nformidable and forbidding in its logic. Castillon reduces Holbach's\r\npropositions to three. The self-existence of matter, the essential\r\nrelation of movement to it, and the possibility of deriving everything\r\nfrom it or some mode of it. Castillon concludes after five hundred pages\r\nof reasoning that matter is contingent, movement not inherent in it,\r\nand that purely spiritual beings exist in independence of it. Hence\r\nthe _Système de la Nature_ is a \"long and wicked error.\" Holland's is a\r\nstill more serious work, which the Sorbonne recommended strongly as\r\nan antidote against Holbach's _Système_ which it qualified as \"une\r\nmalheureuse production que notre siècle doit rougir d'avoir enfantée.\"\r\nBut when it was discovered that Holland was a Protestant his work was\r\ncondemned forthwith, Jan. 17, 1773.\r\n\r\nBergier's refutation is interesting as an attack from a churchman\r\nof extraordinary keenness and insight into the progress of the new\r\nphilosophy. In the _Système de la Nature_ he recognized the hand of the\r\nauthor of _La Contagion sacrée_ and the _Essai sur les préjugés_\r\nand dealt with it as he did the _Christianisme dévoilé_. Buzonniere,\r\nRochfort and Fangouse are milder and more naive in their demonstrations\r\nand their works are of no weight or interest. _L'Impie démasqué_ is\r\na brutal work which qualifies Holbach as a \"vile apostle of vice and\r\ncrime,\" and the _Système de la Nature_ as the most impudent treatise on\r\natheism that has yet dishonored the globe--one which covers the century\r\nwith shame and will be the scandal of future generations.\r\n\r\nThe work of Paulian is of a different sort. Coming comparatively late,\r\nit attempted to review the hostile opinions of many years and then mass\r\nthem in an overwhelming final attack on the _Système de la Nature_. To\r\nthis end Paulian rewrites the entire book chapter by chapter, giving\r\nthe \"true version.\" He then reviews Holland's outline and Bergier's\r\ncomments, together with seven articles directed explicitly against the\r\n_Système de la Nature_ in such works as the _Lettres Helviennes_, of\r\nAbbé Barruel, _Dict. des Philosophes_, _Dict. anti-philosophe_, his own\r\n_Dict. théologique_, etc., besides many other writings against the\r\nnew philosophy in general. He then reviews articles by members of the\r\nphilosophic school against materialism and then goes back to Holbach's\r\nsources, Diderot, Bayle, Spinoza, Lucretius, Epicurus, etc. The work is\r\nnot scholarly but comprehensive and evidently discouraged further formal\r\nrefutations.\r\n\r\nThe _Système de la Nature_ had many critics in the stormy days that\r\nfollowed 1789. Delisle de Sales found it a monstrosity--a _fratras_; La\r\nHarpe called it an infamous book, \"un amas de bêtises qu'on ose appeler\r\nphilosophie, inconcevables inepties, un immense échafaudage de mensonge\r\net d'invective\"; M. Villemain is much more calm and fair; Lord Brougham,\r\nlike Damiron, Buzonnière, and many others, found it seductive but full\r\nof false reasoning; Lerminier was so severe that St.-Beuve was moved to\r\ndefend Holbach against him. Samuel Wilkinson, the English translator of\r\n1820, is one of the few whose criticism is at all favorable. Holbach has\r\nalways appealed to a certain type of radical mind and his translators\r\nand editors have generally been men who were often over-enthusiastic.\r\nFor example, Mr. Wilkinson says of the _Système de la Nature_, [64:15]\r\n\"No work, ancient or modern, has surpassed it in the eloquence and\r\nsublimity of its language or in the facility with which it treats\r\nthe most abstruse and difficult subjects. It is without exception the\r\nboldest effort the human mind has yet produced in the investigation of\r\nMorals and Theology. The republic of letters has never produced another\r\nauthor whose pen was so well calculated to emancipate mankind from all\r\nthose trammels with which the nurse, the school master, and the priest\r\nhave successively locked up their noblest faculties, before they were\r\ncapable of reasoning and judging for themselves.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems unnecessary to analyze the _Système de la Nature_. This has\r\nbeen done by Damiron, Soury, Fabre, Lange, Morley, the historians of\r\nphilosophy, and encyclopaedists; and the book itself is easily available\r\nin the larger libraries. The substance of Holbach's philosophy is\r\nsusceptible of clearer treatment apart from it or any one of his books,\r\nalthough it permeates all of them.\r\n\r\nM. Jules Soury has said, in describing a certain type of mind: \"Il est\r\nd'heureux esprits, des âmes fortes et saines, que n'effraie point le\r\nsilence éternel des espaces infinis où s'anéantissait la raison de\r\nPascal. Naïves et robustes natures, mâles et vigoureux penseurs, qui\r\ngardent toute la vie quelque chose des dons charmants de la jeunesse et\r\nde l'enfance même, une foi vive dans le témoinage immédiat de nos sens\r\net de notre conscience, une humeur alerte, toute de joyeuse ardeur,\r\net comme une intrépidité d'esprit que rien n'arrête. Pour eux tout est\r\nclair et uni; ou à peu près, et là où ils soupçonnent quelque bas-bond\r\ninsondable, ils se détournent et poursuivent fièrement leur chemin.\r\nComme cet Epicurien dont parle Cicéron au commencement du _De natura\r\ndeorum_, ils ont toujours l'air de sortir de l'assemblée des dieux et de\r\ndescendre des intermondes d'Epicure.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was Holbach. His philosophy is based on the child-like assumption\r\nthat things are as they seem, provided they are observed with sufficient\r\ncare by a sufficient number of people. This brings us at once to the\r\nvery heart of Holbach's method which was experimental and inductive\r\nto the last degree. Holbach was nourished on what might be called\r\nscientific rather than philosophical traditions. As M. Tourneux has\r\npointed out, he had been a serious student of the natural sciences,\r\nespecially those connected with the constitution of the earth. These\r\nstudies led him to see the disparity between certain accepted and\r\ntraditional cosmologies and a scientific interpretation of the\r\nterrestrial globe and the forms of life which flourish upon it. Finding\r\nthe supposed sacred and infallible records untrustworthy in one regard,\r\nhe began to question their veracity at other points. Being of a\r\ncritical frame of mind, he took the records rather more literally than\r\na sympathetic, allegorical apologist would have done, although it cannot\r\nbe said that he used much historical insight. After having studied the\r\nsacred texts for purposes of writing or having translated other men's\r\nstudies on Moses, David, the Prophets, Jesus, Paul, the Christian\r\ntheologians and saints, miracles, etc., he concluded that these accounts\r\nwere untrustworthy and mendacious. He knew ancient and modern philosophy\r\nand found in the greater part of it an unwarranted romantic or\r\ntheological trend which his scientific training had caused him to\r\nsuspect. It must be admitted that however false or illogical Holbach's\r\nconclusions may be considered, he was by no means ignorant of the\r\nsubjects he chose to treat, as some of his detractors would have one\r\nbelieve. His theory of knowledge was that of Locke and Condillac, and\r\non this foundation he built up his system of scientific naturalism and\r\ndogmatic atheism.\r\n\r\nHis initial assumption is, as has been suggested, that experience\r\n(application réitérée des sens) and reason are trustworthy guides to\r\nknowledge. By them we become conscious of an external objective world,\r\nof which sentient beings themselves are a part, from which they receive\r\nimpressions through their sense organs. These myriad impressions when\r\ncompared and reflected upon form reasoned knowledge or truth, provided\r\nthey are substantiated by repeated experiences carefully made. That is,\r\nan idea is said to be true when it conforms perfectly with the actual\r\nexternal object. This is possible unless one's senses are defective, or\r\none's judgment vitiated by emotion and passion.\r\n\r\nHolbach's contention is that if one applies experience and reason to\r\nthe external universe, or nature, \"ce vaste assemblage de tout ce qui\r\nexiste\"; it reveals a _single objective reality_, i. e., _matter_, which\r\nis in itself essentially active or in a state of motion.\r\n\r\nFrom matter in motion are derived all the phenomena that strike our\r\nsenses. All is matter or a function of it. Matter, then, is not an\r\neffect, but a cause. It is not caused; it is from eternity and of\r\nnecessity. The cardinal point in Holbach's philosophy is an inexorable\r\nmaterialistic necessity. Nothing, then, is exempt from the laws of\r\nphysics and chemistry. Inorganic substance and organic life fall into\r\nthe same category. Man himself with all his differentiated faculties\r\nis but a function of matter and motion in extraordinary complex and\r\ninvolved relations. Man's imputation to himself of free will and\r\nunending consciousness apart from his machine is an idle tale built on\r\nhis desires, not on his experiences nor his knowledge of nature. This\r\nimputation of a will or soul to nature, independent of it or in any\r\nsense above it, is a still more idle one derived from his renunciation\r\nof the witness of his senses and his following after the phantoms of his\r\nimagination. It is ignorance or disregard of nature then that has\r\ngiven rise to supernatural ideas that have \"no correspondence with true\r\nsight,\" or, as Holbach expressed it, have no counterpart in the external\r\nobject. In other words, theology, or poetry about God, as Petrarch said,\r\nis ignorance of natural causes reduced to a system.\r\n\r\nMan is a purely natural or physical being, like a tree or a stone. His\r\nso-called spiritual nature (l'homme moral) is merely a phase of his\r\nphysical nature considered under a special aspect. He is all matter in\r\nmotion, and when that ceases to function in a particular way, called\r\nlife, he ceases to be as a conscious entity. He is so organized, however\r\nthat his chief desires are to survive and render his existence happy.\r\nBy happiness Holbach means the presence of pleasure and the absence of\r\npain. In all his activity, then, man will seek pleasure and avoid pain.\r\nThe chief cause of man's misery or lack of well being is his ignorance\r\nof the powers and possibilities of his own nature and the Universal\r\nNature. All he needs is to ascertain his place in nature and adjust\r\nhimself to it. From the beginning of his career he has been the dupe\r\nof false ideas, especially those connected with supernatural powers,\r\non whom he supposed he was dependent. But, if ignorance of nature gave\r\nbirth to the Gods, knowledge of nature is calculated to destroy them and\r\nthe evils resulting from them, the introduction of theistic ideas into\r\npolitics and morals. In a word, the truth, that is, _correct ideas of\r\nnature_ is the one thing needful to the happiness and well-being of man.\r\n\r\nThe application of these principles to the given situation in France in\r\n1770 would obviously have produced unwelcome results. Holbach's theory\r\nwas that religion was worse than useless in that it had inculcated false\r\nand pernicious ideas in politics and morals. He would do away completely\r\nwith it in the interest of putting these sciences on a natural basis.\r\nThis basis is self-interest, or man's inevitable inclination toward\r\nsurvival and the highest degree of well-being, \"L'objet de la morale est\r\nde faire connaître aux hommes que leur plus grand intérêt exige qu'ils\r\npratiquent la vertu; le but du gouvernement doit être de la leur faire\r\npratiquer.\"\r\n\r\nGovernment then assumes the functions of moral restraint formally\r\ndelegated to religion; and punishments render virtue attractive and vice\r\nrepugnant. Holbach's theory of social organization is practically that\r\nof Aristotle. Men combine in order to increase the store of individual\r\nwell-being, to live the good life. If those to whom society has\r\ndelegated sovereignty abuse their power, society has the right to take\r\nit from them. Sovereignty is merely an agent for the diffusion of truth\r\nand the maintenance of virtue, which are the prerequisites of social and\r\nindividual well-being. The technique of progress is enlightenment and\r\ngood laws.\r\n\r\nNothing could be clearer or simpler than Holbach's system. As Diderot\r\nso truly said, he will not be quoted on both sides of any question.\r\nHis uncompromising atheism is the very heart and core of his system\r\nand clarifies the whole situation. All supernatural ideas are to be\r\nabandoned. Experience and reason are once for all made supreme, and\r\nhenceforth refuse to share their throne or abdicate in favor of faith.\r\nHolbach's aim was as he said to bring man back to nature and render\r\nreason dear to him. \"Il est tempts que cette raison injustement dégradée\r\nquitte un ton pusillamine qui la rendront complice du mensonge et du\r\ndélire.\"\r\n\r\nIf reason is to rule, the usurper, religion, must be ejected; hence\r\natheism was fundamental to his entire system. He did not suppose by any\r\nmeans that it would become a popular faith, because it presupposed too\r\nmuch learning and reflection, but it seemed to him the necessary weapon\r\nof a reforming party at that time. He defines an atheist as follows:\r\n\"C'est un homme, qui détruit des chimères nuisibles au genre humain,\r\npour ramener les hommes à la nature, à l'expérience, à la raison. C'est\r\nun penseur qui, ayant médité la matière, ses propriétés et ses façons\r\nd'agir, n'a pas besoin, pour expliquer les phénomènes de l'univers et\r\nles opérations de la nature, d'imaginer des puissances idéales, des\r\nintelligences imaginaires, des êtres de raison; qui loin de faire mieux\r\nconnaître cette nature, ne font que la rendre capricieuse, inexplicable,\r\net méconnaissable, inutile au bonheur des hommes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nHOLBACH'S CORRESPONDENCE\r\n\r\n\r\n The following letters of Holbach are extant:\r\n\r\n Holbach to Hume, Aug. 23, 1763.\r\n Holbach to Hume, Mar. 16, 1766.\r\n Holbach to Hume, July 7, 1766.\r\n Holbach to Hume, Aug. 18, 1766.\r\n Holbach to Hume, Sept. 7, 1766.\r\n\r\n These were printed in Hume's _Private Correspondence_, London, 1820,\r\n pp. 252-263, and deal largely with Hume's quarrel with Rousseau.\r\n\r\n Holbach to Garrick, June 16, 1765.\r\n Holbach to Garrick, Feb. 9, 1766.\r\n\r\n These two letters are in manuscript in Lansdowne House,\r\n Coll.

This is my case with you, sir; the reading\r\n of your valuable works has not only inspired me with the strongest\r\n admiration for your genius and amiable parts, but gave me the highest\r\n idea of your person and the strongest desire of getting acquainted\r\n with one of the greatest philosophers of my age, and of the best friend\r\n to mankind.  These sentiments have emboldened me to send formally,\r\n though unknown to you, the work you are mentioning to me.  I thought\r\n you were the best to judge of such a performance, and I took only\r\n the liberty of giving a hint of my desires, in case it should meet\r\n with your approbation, nor was I surprized, or presumed to be\r\n displeased, at seeing my wishes disappointed.  The reasons appeared\r\n very obvious to me; not withstanding the British liberty, I conceived\r\n there were limits even to it.  However, my late friend's book has\r\n appeared since and there is even an edition of it lately done in\r\n England: I believe it will be relished by the friends of truth,\r\n who like to see vulgar errors struck at the root.  This has been\r\n your continued task, sir; and you deserve for it the praises of all\r\n sincere wellwishers of humanity: give me leave to rank myself among\r\n them, and express to you, by this opportunity you have been so kind\r\n as to give me, the fervent desire we have to see you in this country.\r\n Messrs. Stuart, Dempster, Fordyce, who are so good as to favor me\r\n with their company, have given me some hopes of seeing you in this\r\n metropolis, where you have so many admirers as readers, and as many\r\n sincere friends as there are disciples of philosophy.  I don't doubt\r\n but my good friend M. Helvétius will join in our wishes, and prevail\r\n upon you to come over.  I assure you, sir, you won't perceive much\r\n the change of the country, for all countries are alike for people that\r\n have the same minds.\r\n\r\n I am, with the greatest veneration and esteem, sir, your most\r\n obedient and most humble servant.\r\n  D'HOLBACH.\r\n  Rue Royale, butte St. Roch, à Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n HOLBACH To GARRICK\r\n (Coll. Forster, Vol. XXI; pub., Hedgcock, p. 253)\r\n PARIS, Feb ye 9th, 1766.\r\n\r\n I received, my very Dear Sir, with a great deal of pleasure, your\r\n agreeable letter of ye 24th of January, but was very sorry to hear\r\n that you are inlisted in the numerous troup of _gouty_ people.  Tho'\r\n I have myself the honour of being of that tribe I dont desire my\r\n friends should enter into the same corporation.  I am particularly\r\n griev'd to see you among the invalids for you have, more than any\r\n other, occasion for the free use of your limbs.  However, don't be\r\n cross and peevish for that would be only increasing you distemper;\r\n and I charge you especially of not scolding that admirable lady\r\n Mrs Garrick, whose sweetness of temper and care must be a great\r\n comfort in your circumstances.  I beg leave to present her with my\r\n respects and ye compliments of my wife, that has enjoyed but an\r\n indifferent state of health, owing to the severity of the winter.\r\n Mr and Made Helvetius desire you both their best wishes and so do\r\n all your friends, for whom I can answer that every one of them\r\n keeps a kind remembrance of your valuable persons.  Dr. Gem thinks\r\n you'll do very well to go to Bath, but his opinion is that a thin\r\n diet would be more serviceable to you than anything else; believe\r\n he is in the right.  Abbé Morellet pays many thanks for the answers\r\n to his queries, but complains of their shortness and laconism;\r\n however it is not your fault.  He is glad to hear you have receiv'd\r\n his translation of Beccaria's book, _Des délits et des peines_ and\r\n the compliments of our friend Dr Gatti to whom I gave your direction\r\n before he went to London.  Our friend Suard has entered his neck into\r\n the matrimonial halter; we are all of us very sorry for it for we know\r\n that nothing combin'd with love, will at last make nothing at all.\r\n\r\n I was not much surpris'd at the particulars you are pleas'd to mention\r\n about Rousseau.  According to the thorough knowledge I have had of\r\n him I look on that man as a mere philosophical quack, full of\r\n affectation, of pride, of oddities and even villainies; the work he\r\n is going to publish justifies the last imputation.  Is his memory so\r\n short as to forget that Mr Grimm, for those 9 years past, has taken\r\n care of the mother of his wench or _gouvernante_ whom he left to starve\r\n here after having debauch'd her daughter and having got her 3 or 4\r\n times with child.  That great philosopher should remember that\r\n Mr. Grimm has in his hands letters under his own hand-writing that\r\n prove him the most ungrateful dogg in the world.  During his last\r\n stay in Paris he made some attempts to see Mr Diderot, and being\r\n refused that favor, he pretended that Diderot endeavoured to see\r\n him, but that himself had refused peremptorily to comply with his\r\n request.  I hope these particulars will suffice to let you know what\r\n you are to think of that illustrious man.  I send you here a copy of\r\n a letter supposed to come from the King of Prussia, but done by\r\n Mr Horace Walpole, whereby you'll see that gentleman has found out\r\n his true character.  But enough of that rascal who deserves not to be\r\n in Mr Hume's company but rather among the bears, if there are any in\r\n the mountains of Wales.\r\n\r\n I am surprized you have not receiv'd yet the _Encyclopédie_, for a\r\n great number of copies have been sent over already to England unless\r\n you have left your subscription here, where hitherto not one copy has\r\n been delivered for prudent reasons.\r\n\r\n We have had in the French Comedy a new play called _Le Philosophie sans\r\n le savoir_ done and acted in a new stile, quite natural and moving: it\r\n has a prodigious success and deserves it extremely well.  Marmontel\r\n will give us very soon upon the Italian stage his comical opera of\r\n _La Bergère des Alpes_.  I hope it will prove very agreeable to the\r\n Publick, having been very much delighted by the rehearsal of it; the\r\n music was done by Mr Cohaut who teaches my wife to play on the luth.\r\n We expect a tragedy of the Dutch Barnvelt.\r\n\r\n Mr Wilkes is still in this town, where he intends to stay until you\r\n give him leave to return to his native country.  We have had the\r\n pleasure of seeing Mr Chanquion, your friend, who seems to be a very\r\n discerning gentleman and to whom in favor of your friendship I have\r\n shown all the politeness I could.  I hear that Sr James Macdonald has\r\n been ill at Parma, but is now recovered and in Rome.  Abbé Galliani is\r\n still at Naples and stands a fair chance of being employ'd in the\r\n ministry there.\r\n\r\n Adieu, very dear Sir and remember your affectionate friend\r\n  D'HOLBACH\r\n\r\n\r\n HOLBACH TO WILKES\r\n (Brit. Mus. Mss., Vol. 30869, p. 39)\r\n PARIS the 22d Of May (1766)\r\n\r\n _My dear Sir_\r\n\r\n I am extremely glad to know your lucky passage and happy arrival\r\n in your native country.  I hope you know too well the sincere\r\n dispositions of my heart as to doubt of the friendship I have\r\n vowed to you for life; it has been of too long a duration to be\r\n shaken by any circumstances, and especially by those that do honor\r\n to you.  I shall be very happy if your affairs (that seem to be in\r\n a fair way) permit you to drop over very soon to spend some time\r\n in this place along with Miss Wilkes to whom Made D'Holbach and I\r\n pay our best compliments.  I can easily paint to my imagination\r\n the pleasure you both felt at your first meeting; everybody that\r\n has any sensibility must be acquainted with the grateful pangs in\r\n those moving circumstances.\r\n\r\n Your case with the hawker at your entry in London is very odd and\r\n whimsical you did extremely well to humour the man in his opinion\r\n about Mr. Wilkes.  I dare say if you had done otherwise his fist\r\n would have convinc'd you of the goodness of your cause, and then it\r\n would have been impossible for you to pass for a dead man any longer;\r\n which however, I think was very necessary for you in the beginning.\r\n I expect with great eagerness the settlement of your affairs with\r\n the ministry to your own satisfaction; be persuaded, Dear Sir, that\r\n nobody interests himself in your happiness than myself, and nothing\r\n will conduce more to it than your steady attachment to the principles\r\n of honor and patriotism.\r\n\r\n If you don't find a way of disposing of the little packet, you need\r\n not take much trouble about it, and you may bring it back along with\r\n you, when you come to this place, as to the kind offers you are so\r\n good as to make me about commissions, experience has taught me that\r\n it is unsafe to trust you with them, so I beg leave with gratitude\r\n to decline your proposals as that point.\r\n\r\n All our common friends and acquaintances desire their best\r\n compliments to you, and believe me, my dear Sir.\r\n\r\n  Your affectionate oblig'd humble servant\r\n  D'HOLBACH\r\n\r\n\r\n HOLBACH TO WILKES\r\n (Brit.

You know the sentiments of my heart, and are undoubtedly\r\n convinc'd how much I wish for the good success of all your enterprises\r\n tho I am to be a great looser by it.  I rejoice very heartily at the\r\n fine prospect you have now in view and don't doubt but the persons you\r\n mention will succeed if they are in good earnest: which is allways a\r\n little doubtful in people of that Kidney.\r\n\r\n We have had the pleasure of seeing Miss Wilkes three or four times since\r\n your departure, she is extreamly well and longs for the return of her\r\n friend Mlle Helvetius the 20th of this month.\r\n\r\n Rousseau will very likely hate the English very cordially for making\r\n him pay so dear for his books, it is however a sign that he told us a\r\n lye when he pretended in his writings to have no books at all, as to\r\n his guitar he should buy a new one to tune his heart a little better\r\n than he did before.\r\n\r\n We have no news here, except the Election of Mr Thomas as a member of\r\n the french academy.  Marquis Beccaria is going to leave us very soon\r\n being obliged to return to Milan: Count Veri will at the same time set\r\n out for England.\r\n\r\n I'll be oblig'd to you for a copy or two of the book printed in holland\r\n you mentioned in your letter you may send it by some private opportunity\r\n to Miss Wilkes, with, proper directions.  A gentleman of our Society\r\n should be glad to get 2 copies of Baskervilles' virgil _in octavo_.\r\n\r\n Tho Mr Davenport and Rousseau seem to be pleased very much with one\r\n another, I suppose they may very soon be tired of their squabbling,\r\n and the latter like the apostles will shake of against the barbarous\r\n Britons the dust of his feet.\r\n\r\n Receive the hearty compliments of my wife and all our friends.  You\r\n know the true sentiments of my heart for you,\r\n Dear Sir.  I am with great sincerity\r\n  your most obedient humble Servant\r\n  D'HOLBACH\r\n\r\n\r\n HOLBACH TO WILKES\r\n (Brit. Mus.

I was extreamly glad to hear your happy\r\n arrival at that place, and do not doubt but you met with a lucky\r\n passage to Dover the following day, we are now enjoying the conversation\r\n of your British friends about elections; that will not be tedious for\r\n you if, according to your hopes, you should succeed in your projects.\r\n\r\n I see by your letter that instead of coming back directly by Calais\r\n you intend to travel with Miss Wilkes through Antwerp and the Low\r\n countries, which I should think not very advisable in this rigorous\r\n season of the year, for generally at that time the waters are lock'd\r\n up by the frost and travelling is bad et tedious and may be would\r\n prove hurtful to your tender fellow traveler to whom my wife and I\r\n desire our best compliments.  Such a scheme will be more advantagious\r\n for you both and more conformable to the wishes of your friends in\r\n this place.\r\n\r\n I hope your arrival in London will contribute to reconcile abbé\r\n Galliani to that place, where he complains of having not heard of\r\n the sun since he set his foot on British shore, however he may\r\n comfort himself for we have had very little of it in this country.\r\n The Abbé must be overjoy'd at the news of the Jesuits being expell'd\r\n from his Native country for now he may say _Gens inimica mihi\r\n Tyrrhenum navigat aquor_.  We have no material news in this country,\r\n except that the queen continues to be in a very bad state of health.\r\n\r\n If there is some good new romance I'll be oblig'd to bring it over\r\n along with you as, well as a couple of french books call'd\r\n _Militaire philosophe_ and _Théologie portative_ in case you may\r\n easily find them in London, for we cannot get them here.  I am told\r\n the works of one Morgan have been esteem'd in your country but I don't\r\n know the titles of them, if you should know them and meet with them\r\n with facility, I should be very much oblig'd to you provided you make\r\n me pay a little more than you have done hitherto for your commissions.\r\n\r\n All our common friends beg their compliments and I wish for your\r\n speedy return, and I am Sincerely\r\n Dear Sir\r\n  Your faithful affectionate humble servant\r\n  D'HOLBACH\r\n PARIS the 10th of decemb. 1767\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n HOLBACH TO WILKES\r\n (Brit.

I am extreamly glad that your generous\r\n soul is very far from sinking under the weight of these Misfortunes,\r\n and to see that you don't give up the hopes of carrying triumphantly\r\n your point notwithstanding the discouragements you have met with lately.\r\n I need not tell you how much your friends in Paris and I in particular\r\n interest ourselves in all the events that may befall you.  Our old\r\n friendship ought to be a sure pledge of my sincere sentiments for you,\r\n and of my best wishes for your good success in all your undertakings.\r\n I believe you can do no better but to keep strictly to the rules you\r\n have laid down for your conduct, and I don't doubt but you'll find it\r\n will answer the best to your purpose.\r\n\r\n I am very much oblig'd to you, Dear Sir, for the kind offers you make\r\n in your friendly letter.

Such a collection must be the business of many years; it\r\n is to be found only after the decease of some curious men who have taken\r\n a great deal of trouble to collect them.  I found indeed in two shops 8\r\n or 10 of them, but the proofs (les épreuves) were very indifferent and\r\n they wanted to sell them excessively dear; in general 200 guineas would\r\n procure a collection very far from being compleat.\r\n\r\n My wife and all our common acquaintence desire their best compliments\r\n to you and to Miss Wilkes and you know the sentiments wherewith I am\r\n for ever\r\n Dear Sir\r\n  your affectionate friend and\r\n  very humble servant\r\n  D'HOLBACH\r\n\r\n\r\n HOLBACH TO WILKES\r\n (Brit.

A little more patience and you'll reach the end\r\n of all your misfortunes, that have been faithfully partaken by your\r\n friends in England and abroad, for my own part I wish most sincerely\r\n that everything for the future may turn to your profit and welfare,\r\n without hurting that of your country, to whom, as a lover of mankind,\r\n I am a well wisher.\r\n\r\n My wife desires her best compliments to you and your beloved Daughter,\r\n whom we both expect to see again with a great deal of pleasure in\r\n this country next month.  Notwithstanding our bad circumstances we\r\n are making very great preparations for the Wedding of the Dauphin,\r\n and our metropolis begins already to be filled with foreigners that\r\n flock hither from all parts of the world.

Je vois que celle-ci a été longtemps en route, attendu\r\n que M. Torcia à qui M. Diderot s'était chargé de la remettre, a\r\n encore traînassé quelque temps à Paris, suivant la louable\r\n coutume des voyageurs qui nous quittent toujours avec peine.\r\n\r\n Je suis bien aise que vous ayez lu le livre de Mirabaud qui fait\r\n un bruit affreux dans ce pays.  L'abbé Bergier l'a déjà\r\n réfuté très-longuement et sa réponse paraîtra cet hiver.  La\r\n Sorbonne est, dit-on, occupée à détruire ce maudit _Système_ qui\r\n lui paraît au moins hérétique.  Voltaire lui-même se prépare\r\n à le pulvériser; en attendant nos seigneurs du Parlement y\r\n viennent d'y répondre par des fagots, ainsi qu'à quelque autres\r\n ouvrages de même trempe.  Ce qu'il y a de fâcheux c'est que\r\n l'ouvrage de V. qui a pour titre _Dieu et les hommes_ a été\r\n enveloppé dans la même condamnation, ce qui doit déplaire\r\n souverainement à l'auteur.  Je me rappelle à cette occasion ce\r\n que M. Hume dit d'un catholique que Henri VIII fit conduire au\r\n bûcher avec quelques hérétiques, et dont le seul chagrin était\r\n d'être brûlé en si mauvaise compagnie.  Nonobstant toutes ces\r\n réfutations, il parait tous les jours quelques nouveaux ouvrages\r\n impies, au point que je suis très surpris que la récolte ait été\r\n si bonne dans le royaume.  En dernier lieu on vient de publier un\r\n ouvrage sous le titre de _Droit des souverains sur les biens du\r\n clergé_, qui, sans contenir des impiétés n'en est pas moins déplaisant\r\n pour cela: Il va droit à la cuisine, et veut que pour liquider\r\n la dette nationale on vende tous les biens ecclésiastiques et\r\n que l'on met nos pontifes à la pension.  Vous sentez qu'une\r\n proposition si mal sonnante n'a pu manquer de mettre le ciel en\r\n courroux; sa colère s'est déchargé sur cinq ou six libraires et\r\n colporteurs qui ont été mis en prison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ENDNOTES]\r\n\r\n\r\n [1:1] Diderot, _Oeuvres_, ed.

Ich gedenke statt aller des\r\n _Système de la Nature_, das wir aus Neugier in die Hand nahmen.  Wir\r\n begriffen nicht, wie ein solches Buch gefährlich sein könnte.  Es kam\r\n uns so grau, so cimmerisch, so totenhaft vor, das wir Mühe hatten,\r\n seine Gegenwart auszuhalten, dass wir davor wie vor einern Gespenste\r\n schauderten.  Der Verfasser glaubt sein Buch ganz eigens zu empfehlen,\r\n wenn er in der Vorrede versichert, dass er, als ein abgelebter Greis,\r\n soeben in die Grube stiegend, der Mit- und Nachwelt die Wahrheit verkünden\r\n wolle.  Wir lachten ihn aus: denn wir glaubten bemerkt zu haben, dass\r\n von alten Leuten eigentlich an der Welt nichts geschätzt werde, was\r\n liebenswürdig und gut an ihr ist.  \"Alte Kirchen haben dunkle Gläser\"\r\n \"Wie Kirschen und Beeren schmecken, muss mann Kinder und Sperlinge\r\n fragen\"--dies waren unsere Lust und Leibworte: und so schien uns jenes\r\n Buch, als die rechte Quintessenz der Greisenheit, unschmachhaft, ja\r\n abgeschmackt Alles sollte notwendig sein und deswegen kein Gott.\r\n \"Könnte es denn aber nicht auch notwendig einen Gott geben?\" fragten\r\n wir.  Dabei gestanden wir freilich, das wir uns den Notwendigkeiten der\r\n Tage und Nächte, der Jahrszeiten, der klirnatischen Einflusse, der\r\n physichen und animalischen Zustände nicht wohl entziehen könnten: doch\r\n fühlten wir etwas in uns, das als vollkommene Willkür erschien, und\r\n wieder etwas, das sich mit dieser Willkür ins Gleichgewicht zu setzen\r\n suchte.  Die Hoffnung, immer vernünftiger zu werden, uns von den aussern\r\n Dingen, ja von uns selbst immer unabhängiger zu machen, konnten wir\r\n nicht aufgeben.  Das Wort Freiheit klingt so schon, dass mann es nicht\r\n entbehren könnte und wenn es einen Irrtum bezeichnete.\r\n\r\n Keiner von uns hatte das Buch hinausgelesen; denn wir fanden uns in\r\n der Erwartung getäuscht, in der wir es auf geschlagen hatten.\r\n _System der Natur_ ward angekündigt und wir hofften also wirklich\r\n etwas von der Natur, unsere Abgötten, zu erfahren.  Physik und Chemie,\r\n Himmels- und Erdbeschriebung, Naturgeschichte und Anatomie und so\r\n manches andere hatte nun zeit Jahren und bis auf den letzten Tag uns\r\n immer auf die geschmüchte grosse Welt hingeweisen, und wir hatten gern\r\n von Sonnen und Sternen, von Planeten und Monden, von Bergen, Thälern,\r\n Flüssen und Meeren und von allem, was dann lebt und webt, das Nähere\r\n sowie das Allgemeinere erfahren.  Das hierbei wohl manches vorkommen\r\n müsste, was dem gemeinen Menschen als schädlich, der Geistlichkeit als\r\n gefährlich, dem Staat als unzulässig erschienen möchte, daran hatten wir\r\n keinen Zweifel, und wir hofften, dieses Büchlein sollte nicht unwürdig\r\n die Feuerprobe bestauden haben.  Allein wie hohl und leer ward uns in\r\n deiser tristen Atheistischen Halbnacht zu Mute, in welcher die Erde mit\r\n allen ihren Gebilden, der Himmel mit allen seinen Gestirnen verschwand!\r\n Eine Materie sollte sein von Ewigkeit und von Ewigkeit her bewegt, und\r\n sollte nun mit dieser Bewegung rechts und links und nach allen Seiten\r\n ohne weiteres die unendlichen Phänomene des Daseins hervorbringen.\r\n Dies alles wären wir sogar zufrieden gewesen, wenn der Verfasser\r\n wirklich aus seiner bewegten Materie die Welt vor unsern Augen\r\n aufgebaut hätte.  Aber er mochte von der Natur so wenig wissen als wir;\r\n denn indem er einige allgemeine Begriffe hingepfahlt, verlässt er sie\r\n sogleich, um dasjenige, was höher als die Natur oder als höhere\r\n Natur in der Natur erschient, zur materiellen schweren, zwar bewegten,\r\n aber doch richtungs- und gestaltlosen Natur zu verwandeln, und glaubt\r\n dadurch recht viel gewonnen zu haben.  Wenn uns jedoch dieses Buch\r\n einigen Schaden gebracht hat, so war es der, das wir allen\r\n Philosophie, besonderers aber der Metaphysick recht herzlich gram\r\n wurden, und bleiben, dagegen aber auf lebendige Wissen, Erfahren,\r\n Thun und Dichten uns nur desto lebhafter und leidenschaftlicher hinwarfen.\r\n\r\n [64:15] Vol. II, p. 261, ed. 1820.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY--PART I.\r\n\r\n EDITIONS OF HOLBACH'S WORKS IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER.\r\n\r\n\r\n As the works of Holbach are not yet cataloged in the Bibliothèque\r\n Nationale, the following list is doubtless incomplete.
