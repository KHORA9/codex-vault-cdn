To both these professions it is\r\nessential that a knowledge of the science of Sex and the various causes\r\nfor the existence of “abnormals” should be ascertained, so that they may\r\nbe guided in the future in their investigations into, and the practice\r\nof attempts to mitigate, the evil which undoubtedly exists, and to bring\r\nabout a more healthy class of beings. It is the first time that the\r\nsubject has been so carefully and fully gone into in the English\r\nlanguage, and it is believed that the very exhaustive examination which\r\nthe author has made into the matter, and the various cases to which he\r\nhas called attention, will be of considerable use to the medical\r\npractitioner, and also to the lawyer in criminal and quasi-criminal\r\nmatters, and probably in matrimonial disputes and cases of insanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n\r\n  INTRODUCTION

love.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe sexuality of the modern civilized man--the sum, that is to say, of\r\nthe phenomena of sexual love dependent upon and associated with the\r\nsexual impulse--is the result of a process of development lasting many\r\nthousands of years. Therein, as in a mirror, we may see an accurate\r\nreflection of all the phases of the bodily and mental history of the\r\nhuman race. Anyone who wishes to understand modern love in all its\r\ncomplexity must, in the first place, succeed in informing himself, not\r\nmerely regarding the first foundations of the feeling of love in the\r\ngrey primeval age, but, in addition, as to the manner in which that\r\nfeeling has been transformed and enriched in the course of the history\r\nof civilization. For modern love is a complex of two constituents.\r\n\r\nThe word “love” is applicable to the sexual impulse of human beings\r\nonly. Its use implies that in the case of man the purely animal feelings\r\nhave acquired an =importance= far greater than that of subserving the\r\npurposes of mere reproduction, and aim at a =goal= transcending that of\r\nthe preservation of the species. The nature of human love can be\r\nunderstood and explained only with reference to this intimate and\r\ninseparable union of its purposes in respect of the preservation of the\r\nspecies and its independent significance in the life of the loving\r\nindividual himself. Herein is to be found the starting-point of the\r\nwhole so-called “sexual problem,” and it is necessary that the matter\r\nshould be clearly understood at the outset of this book. In earlier days\r\nhuman love was mainly concerned with the purposes of the species. Modern\r\ncivilized man, conceiving history as progress in the consciousness of\r\nfreedom, has also come to recognize the profound =individual=\r\nsignificance of love for his own inward growth, for the proper\r\ndevelopment of his free manhood. To quote a phrase from Georg Hirth, a\r\ncultured modern writer, the genuine experienced love of a civilized man\r\nof the present day is one of the “ways to freedom.” By love is made\r\nmanifest, and through love is developed, his inmost individual nature.\r\nFor this reason Schopenhauer’s “Metaphysik der Geschlechtsliebe”\r\n(“Metaphysic of Sexual Love”), which wholly ignores this individual\r\nfactor, must be regarded, brilliant as it unquestionably is, as a quite\r\ninadequate explanation of the nature of love. Again, a recent writer,\r\nArnold Lindwurm, greatly influenced by Schopenhauer’s teaching, in the\r\nintroduction to his work entitled “Ueber die Geschlechtsliebe in\r\nsozial-ethische Beziehung” (“Sexual Love in its Socio-Ethical\r\nRelations”), writes: “The =fruit of love=, =children=, and =marriage= as\r\na domestic institution indispensable for the upbringing of\r\nchildren--these constitute the author’s ethical criterion in the field\r\nof sexual research; these also form the socio-ethical goal of all sexual\r\nlove, inasmuch as the =sole= standard by which sexual love can be judged\r\nis the procreation and upbringing of children.” We, however, at the very\r\noutset, contest the validity of such a standpoint, for we consider that\r\nit fails entirely to do justice to the nature of modern love. For the\r\nhistory of the human sexual impulse teaches us beyond dispute that, in\r\nthe course of the development of the human species, that impulse,\r\nthrough its progressive association with intellectual and emotional\r\nelements to form the complex whole designated by the term “love,” has\r\nundergone a progressive individualization, and has attained a more\r\ndefined significance for the unitary human being. At the present day\r\nsexual love constitutes a part of the very being of the civilized man;\r\nhis sexual life clearly reflects his individual nature, and love\r\ninfluences his development in an enduring manner.\r\n\r\nLove conjoins in a quite unique way the =two= principal classes of vital\r\nmanifestations--the lower vegetative and the higher animal life; and it\r\nthus constitutes the highest and the most intense expression of the\r\n=unity= of life (Schopenhauer’s “focus of the will;” Weismann’s\r\n“continuity of the germ-plasma”).\r\n\r\nWhoever wishes to understand the developmental tendencies of love as\r\nthey manifest themselves at the present day in the course of human\r\nhistory, whoever desires to grasp how remarkably love has been\r\ndeveloped, enriched, and ennobled in the course of civilization, must at\r\nthe outset gain a clear understanding of this apparently dualistic, but\r\nin reality thoroughly monistic, nature of the passion.\r\n\r\nThe matter may be expressed also in this way--that he who has\r\nscientifically investigated love, who has based his conception of it\r\nphilosophically, and has personally experienced it, will become a\r\nconvinced monist in relation to life, at least, and to the organic\r\nworld, and will be compelled to regard every dualistic division into a\r\nphysical and a spiritual sphere as something quite artificial. In love\r\nabove all is manifested this mystery of the life force, as for centuries\r\nthe poets, the artists, and the metaphysicians have declared, and more\r\nespecially as the great natural philosophers of the eighteenth and\r\nnineteenth centuries have proved--above all Charles Darwin and Ernst\r\nHaeckel. There is, indeed, no more happily chosen metaphor, none that\r\nbetter describes the fundamentally monistic nature of love, than the\r\nsaying of the old æsthetic J. G. Sulzer--that love is a =tree=, that it\r\nhas its =roots= in the physical sphere, but that its =branches= extend\r\nhigh above the physical world, expanding more and more, branching more\r\nand more abundantly into the sphere of the spiritual.[1] It is certainly\r\nimpossible to find a more appropriate comparison. Thereby we show\r\nclearly the intimate =organic= connexion between the physical and\r\nspiritual phenomena of love; it is rooted for ever in Mother Earth, but\r\nit grows always upwards into the subtle ether. Just as the arborescence\r\nof the tree has a richer, more manifold, more extensive development than\r\nthe root, so also it is in the =spiritual= form that love is first\r\ncapable of extending upwards and in all directions, compared with which\r\nits physical capacity for development is minimal and strictly limited.\r\n=But just as the arborescence of the tree grows from, and is supplied\r\nwith nutriment by, the root, so also the higher love is inevitably\r\nfounded upon a sensory basis. Even while= love becomes spiritually\r\nricher, it remains as irrevocably as ever dependent upon the\r\nphysical.[2]\r\n\r\nTo put the matter briefly, the future =developmental possibilities= of\r\nhuman love rest purely in the spiritual sphere, but they are inseparably\r\nconnected with the far less variable physical phenomena of sexuality.\r\n\r\nUpon the development, the configuration, and the differentiation, of the\r\nspiritual elements of sexual love are alone based the intimate relations\r\nof love with the process of civilization. This fact is again reflected\r\nin the manifold phases of the evolution of the sentiment of love.\r\n\r\nFor the human spirit in the course of its development has become not\r\nmerely lord of the earth and of the elementary forces of Nature: it has\r\nbecome also lord and master, interpreter and guide, of the sexual\r\nimpulse; for this impulse owes to the human spirit its new and peculiar\r\nlife, its life =capable of further development= as manifested in the\r\nhistory of human love. The history of love is the history of mankind, of\r\ncivilization. For love manifests a continual =progress=, which can be\r\ndenied by those only who have failed to understand the deep significance\r\nof human love in the entire civilized life of all times, and who,\r\nobserving the persistence of the primeval and ever-active sexual\r\nimpulse, elemental in its nature, are led only to a hopeless doubt as to\r\nthe possibility of all love, and thus justify the pessimism with which\r\nSchopenhauer has condemned the significance of human sexual love.\r\nUndoubtedly this elemental impulse persists for ever, and to follow it\r\n=alone= leads to death, to utter desolation, to nothingness, as Tolstoi,\r\nStrindberg, and Weininger, the bitter opponents of modern “love,” have\r\nso vehemently declared. But did these men know true love? Had they\r\nbecome conscious of the inevitable =necessity= with which civilization\r\nin the course of ages and generations had transformed the human sexual\r\nimpulse into love as it now exists, transformed it in so manifold and so\r\nwonderful a way? Had they any idea of the =development= of love, and of\r\nits place and its significance in history?\r\n\r\nLet them believe this, these doubting and despairing souls--=nothing=\r\nhas been destroyed of all the spiritual relations, of all the wonderful\r\npossibilities of development, which have manifested themselves in the\r\ncourse of the long and varied history of the evolution of love. To\r\ndescribe this evolution, it is necessary to draw attention to all those\r\nelements of civilization which =remain at present= influential in love,\r\nbut it is further indispensable to forecast their future development.\r\nOnce again we stand at an important turning-point in the history of\r\nlove. The old separates itself from the new, the better will once more\r\nbe the enemy of the good. But love regarded, as it must now be regarded,\r\nin its inner =nature=, as a sexual impulse most perfectly and completely\r\ninfused with a spiritual content, will remain the inalienable gain of\r\ncivilization; it will stand forth ever purer and more promotive of\r\nhappiness, like a mirror of marvellous clearness, wherein is reflected a\r\npeculiar and accurate picture of the successive epochs of civilization.\r\n\r\n  [1] The natural philosopher Kielmeyer, the teacher of Cuvier, also\r\n  compared the genital organs with the root, the brain with the\r\n  arborescence, of a tree. _Cf._ Arthur Schopenhauer, “New Paralipomena”\r\n  (Grisebach’s edition, p. 217).\r\n\r\n  [2] Eduard von Hartmann points out very effectively that “an assumed\r\n  love without sensuality is merely a fleshless and bloodless phantom of\r\n  the creative imagination” (“Philosophy of the Unconscious,” sixth\r\n  edition, p. 196; Berlin, 1874).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE ELEMENTARY PHENOMENA OF HUMAN LOVE\r\n\r\n\r\n“_The critical natural philosopher conceives this process, this ‘crown\r\nof love,’ in a very matter-of-fact manner, as the process of conjugation\r\nof two cells and the coalescence of their nuclei._”--ERNST HAECKEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS OF CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n  The well-spring of love -- The conjugation of the germinal cells as\r\n  the simplest expression of the nature of the sexes -- The active\r\n  masculine and the passive feminine principles of sexuality -- Their\r\n  representation in ancient mythology -- The significance of sexual\r\n  procreation -- The most important principle of progressive development\r\n  -- The significance of sexual differentiation -- The development of\r\n  heterosexuality -- Vestiges of an original hermaphroditic state in men\r\n  and women -- New acquisitions -- The hymen -- Metchnikoff’s hypothesis\r\n  of the original significance of the hymen -- The “third sex” --\r\n  The   attainment of perfection by means of progressive sexual\r\n  differentiation -- The increase in the intensity of the sexual\r\n  attractive force in the course of human evolution -- Its cause --\r\n  Explanation of Paul Rée -- Theory of Havelock Ellis -- Elementary\r\n  psychical phenomena of love -- A sensation analogous to one of smell\r\n  -- Theories of Steffens, Haeckel, and Kröner -- The specific sexual\r\n  odours of the capryl group -- Odoriferous glands in animals and human\r\n  beings -- An example from Southern Slavonic folk-lore -- The position\r\n  of the nose in relation to the genital system -- The sexual rôle of\r\n  artificial perfumes -- Origin of the latter -- Reduction in size of\r\n  the organ of smell in the human species -- Primary and secondary\r\n  elements in human sexuality -- Bölsche’s “fusion-love” and\r\n  “distance-love” -- Their different significance.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nThe mystery of sexual love, of this “wonder of life,” from which both\r\nreligious belief and artistic inspiration have drawn and continue to\r\ndraw the major part of their force, may ultimately be referred to a\r\nsingle phenomenon in the sexuality of the great group of metazoa to\r\nwhich the major part of the animal world and the human species belong.\r\nThis process is a conjugation of the female germ cell with the male\r\nsperm cell--the “well-spring of love,” to use Haeckel’s expression; in\r\ncomparison with this conjugation, all other spiritual and physical\r\nphenomena, however complicated, are of a subordinate and secondary\r\nnature. From this primitive organic process of reciprocal attraction and\r\nconjugation of the two reproductive cells has arisen the entire complex\r\nof the remaining physical and spiritual phenomena of love. We have, in\r\nthis process of cell conjugation, a picture in little of love, a greatly\r\nsimplified representation of the nature of the relations between man and\r\nwoman; moreover, the highest and the finest psychical experiences and\r\nimpressions occurring under the influence of love are ultimately no more\r\nthan the results of this “erotic chemotropism” of the sperm and germ\r\ncells.\r\n\r\nSexual =differentiation= existed already as a =natural= product in the\r\nearly stages of organic evolution, and =civilization= has done no more\r\nthan develop, increase, and refine that differentiation, which is\r\ntypified in a manner at once simple and convincing--because =directly\r\nvisible=--in the male sperm cell and the female germ cell. Herein the\r\n=specific sexual differences= are made visibly manifest.\r\n\r\nProcreation results from the approach of the male sperm cell towards the\r\nfemale germ cell, and from the entrance of the former into the latter.\r\n\r\nThus, the sperm cell represents the =active=, the germ cell the\r\n=passive=, principle in sexuality. Already in this =most important= act\r\nin the process of procreation the natural relations between man and\r\nwoman are very clearly manifested. This fact is clearly grasped already\r\nin the mythology and the sepulchral symbolism of antiquity. In these the\r\nman is always represented as the active principle; woman, on the\r\ncontrary, as the passive principle.\r\n\r\n  “Peace reigns in the ovum, but when driven by the desire of creation\r\n  the masculine god breaks through the shell and begins his work of\r\n  fertilization, everything at once becomes movement, restless haste,\r\n  impulsive force, unending circulation. Thus the male generative\r\n  principle appears as the representative and embodiment of movement in\r\n  the visible act of creation.... The active principle in Nature appears\r\n  to be identical with the principle of motion.... Winged is the\r\n  phallus, quiescent the female; the man is the principle of movement,\r\n  and the woman the principle of repose; force is the cause of eternal\r\n  change, woman the picture of eternal repose; for which reason the\r\n  ‘earth-mother’ is almost always depicted in a sitting posture”\r\n  (Bachofen).\r\n\r\nThe appearance of =sexual= reproduction in the history of the evolution\r\nof the organic world is an especially instructive example of the great\r\nimportance of differentiation and variation as the most effective\r\nprinciple of evolution in general. The lowliest forms of life reproduce\r\ntheir kind in an extremely simple manner by a process of asexual cell\r\ndivision, which has not improperly been regarded as nothing more than a\r\npeculiar form of =growth=; and this simple process of cell division is\r\nretained as a mode of growth also in the higher organisms which\r\nreproduce their kind by sexual union. In some cases of simple cell\r\ndivision the secondary cell, the “daughter cell,” separates itself from\r\nthe old cell, the “mother cell,” and forms a new complete individual; in\r\nother cases the cell division occurs as gemmiparous reproduction\r\n(budding or pululation), the daughter cell remaining united with the\r\nmother cell, so that a new organ is built up. Reproduction by cell\r\ndivision is found in many plants and lower animals side by side with\r\nsexual reproduction. This latter becomes the exclusive method of\r\nproduction in higher animals and in the human species, whose capacity\r\nfor the procreation of new individuals by cell division, and for the\r\nreplacement of lost organs by growth, has been lost. Thus, the progress\r\nand the gain which on the one hand are derived from the process of\r\nsexual reproduction, whose character we are about to investigate more\r\nclosely, are balanced on the other hand by a loss. We shall often\r\nencounter this fact again in the history of the evolution of the sexual\r\nimpulse, more especially in mankind and in relation to human love.\r\n\r\nWith the evolution of sexual reproduction is introduced the opportunity\r\nfor a great step forward, since an incomparably greater sphere of action\r\nis opened to the differentiation and variability of specific forms than\r\nwas possible in the case of species reproduced asexually (Kerner von\r\nMarilaun, R. Martin). By means of the sexual union of two =differing=\r\nindependent individuals, each of which, again, has been brought into the\r\nworld by the sexual union of two differing individuals, the way is\r\nfreely opened for a progressive differentiation of the individuals of\r\nthis species. No one of them is exactly similar to any other. Each one\r\nexhibits new peculiarities, new capabilities, and all of these play\r\ntheir part in the struggle for existence. This gradually results in a\r\nprogress towards higher, better, more perfect forms. The persistence of\r\nspecific type, due to inheritance, is largely counteracted by sexual\r\nreproduction, inasmuch as the conjugation of reproductive cells derived\r\nfrom two different individuals induces a tendency to progressive\r\nvariation and improvement. Moreover, by this sexual mode of reproduction\r\nthe preservation of the species is rendered much more secure than by\r\nasexual reproduction, whilst at the same time the possibility of\r\ndifferentiation or variation is indubitably increased. We have already\r\ninsisted on the fact that in the striking difference between the sperm\r\ncell of the male and the germ cell of the female we must seek for the\r\nultimate cause of the profound difference between the sexes. Those who\r\nmaintain the theory of the absolute identity of man and woman must\r\ncontinually be reminded of this fact. Unquestionably the greater\r\nmotility of the male reproductive cell as compared with the more passive\r\nquality of the female cell implies the existence of deeply founded\r\npsychical differences; and the existence of these may be assumed with\r\nmore confidence since we know from experience to what a high degree the\r\nfinest psychical peculiarities of father and mother can be transmitted\r\nby inheritance to the child.\r\n\r\n=For this reason, all attempts, whether initiated by some natural\r\nprocess or by some intentional guidance of the process of civilization,\r\ntowards the obliteration of the distinction between the specific\r\nmasculine and the specific feminine, must be regarded as futile, and as\r\nantagonistic to the process of development.= The production of the\r\nso-called “third sex” is unquestionably a step backwards. For bisexual\r\ndifferentiation is an =advance= upon the more primitive form of sexual\r\ndifferentiation in which both the male and the female sexual elements\r\nwere produced by a single individual (=hermaphroditism=). In the\r\nphylogeny of the human species unilateral sexual reproduction gave place\r\nto the bilateral type, the reproductive elements being formed within the\r\nbodies of two =distinct= individuals--the sperm cells within the body of\r\nthe male, the germ cells within the body of the female. In this manner\r\noriginated the contrast between the individuals of the two sexes, or\r\nbisexual differentiation, which, in the course of phylogenetic\r\ndevelopment, has become continually more definite, more extensive, and\r\nmore characteristic, through the operation of the principle of =sexual\r\nselection=; and thus by inheritance and adaptation the mental and\r\nphysical characteristics of sexuality, primitive and superadded, have\r\ngradually become defined and fixed. In the higher ranks of the animal\r\nkingdom and in the human species, this =heterosexuality= has, through\r\ninheritance, become continually more sharply defined; but the traces of\r\nthe primitive hermaphroditic state have never been wholly obliterated.\r\nLove in the human species is manifested by pairing. Such is the normal\r\ncondition, and the =only= condition in harmony with the progressive\r\ntendency towards perfection. But remnants of hermaphroditism, of\r\nbisexuality in a single individual, of the “third sex,” are to be found\r\nin every human being, and are disclosed by embryology and comparative\r\nanatomy in the form of vestiges of female reproductive organs in the\r\nmale and of male reproductive organs in the female. Herein exists an\r\nindisputable proof of the originally hermaphrodite nature of the human\r\nancestry. But these female organs in the male body, and their converse,\r\nthe male organs in the female body, are =stunted=, are rudiments merely;\r\nwhereas in the course of evolution the masculine reproductive organs of\r\nthe male and the feminine reproductive organs of the female have been\r\nmore and more powerfully developed, and more and more sharply\r\ndifferentiated in type, until they have come to constitute the\r\nexpression of the specific differences between man and woman. They alone\r\nrepresent the more advanced stage. Moreover, these vestiges of an early\r\nhermaphroditic condition are in the human species far less extensive\r\nthan in other mammals; and the sexual discrepancy in the human species,\r\nas compared with the lower animals, becomes still more noticeable when\r\nwe take into account the fact that certain parts of the reproductive\r\nsystem are peculiar to mankind, are =new acquisitions=, and, above all,\r\nthe hymen, which is non-existent even in the anthropoid apes.\r\n\r\nThe original purpose of the hymen, which unquestionably must at the time\r\nof its appearance have represented an evolutionary advance, is still\r\nundetermined. Metchnikoff has propounded an interesting hypothesis on\r\nthis subject. According to him, it is very probable that human beings,\r\nduring the earliest period of human history, began sexual relations at\r\nan extremely youthful age, at a time when the external genital organs of\r\nthe boy were not yet fully developed. In such a case the hymen would not\r\nonly have been no hindrance to the act of copulation, but rather, by\r\nnarrowing the vaginal outlet, and thus accommodating its size to the\r\nrelatively too small penis of the male, would have rendered pleasure in\r\nsexual intercourse possible. In such cases, moreover, the hymen would\r\nnot have been brutally lacerated, but gradually dilated. Laceration of\r\nthe hymen represents a later and secondary phenomenon.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact that, even at the present day, among many primitive races,\r\nmarriages commonly take place in childhood, and it is further true that\r\neven in civilized races in a considerable number of cases (15 per cent.,\r\naccording to Budin) the hymen is not always lacerated during sexual\r\nintercourse, but is retained; thus some support is given to\r\nMetchnikoff’s hypothesis.\r\n\r\nIt is unquestionable that evolution and the progress of civilization\r\nhave resulted in an extremely marked differentiation between the two\r\nsexes, and for this reason the formation of a so-called “third sex,” in\r\nwhich these sexual differences are obscured, can only be regarded as a\r\nmarkedly retrogressive step. Ernst von Wolzogen, in a well-known\r\nromance, to which he gave the name of “The Third Sex,” described a kind\r\nof barren, stunted woman, capable, however, of holding her own at work\r\nin competition with men; but in our opinion such women represent merely\r\na =stage of transition= in the great battle of women for the\r\nindependent, free development of their =peculiar= personality. Such\r\ntypes as these are certainly not the final goal of the woman’s movement;\r\nthey are caricatures, products of a false and extreme conception of\r\nwoman’s development. This “third sex,” which Schurtz very justly\r\ncompares to the stunted, barren workers among ants and bees, is\r\nincapable of prolonged existence, and will give place to a new\r\ngeneration of women, who, while fully retaining their specific feminine\r\npeculiarities, will share with men the rights and duties of the great\r\nwork of civilization; and thus this work will unquestionably be enriched\r\nby a number of new and fruitful elements.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed possible that this “third sex,” that hermaphrodites,\r\nhomosexual individuals, sexual “intermediate stages,” also play a\r\ncertain part in the great process of civilization. But their\r\nsignificance is slight and limited, if for this reason alone because\r\nfrom these individuals the possibility of transmission by inheritance of\r\nvaluable peculiarities is cut off, and hence the possibility of a future\r\nperfectibility, of true “progress,” is excluded. There are =two= sexes\r\nonly on which every true advance in civilization depends--the genuine\r\nman and the genuine woman. All other varieties are ultimately no more\r\nthan phantoms, monstrosities, vestiges of primitive sexual conditions.\r\n\r\nVery ably has Mantegazza described the intimate relationship between\r\nthese dreams of the “third sex” and the fantastic aberration of the\r\nsexual impulse. He writes:\r\n\r\n  “While the pathology of love recognizes in many sexual aberrations the\r\n  obscure traces of a general hermaphroditism, imagination, which works\r\n  faster than science, shows us the possibility that in more\r\n  complicated creations sexual differentiation might be more than\r\n  twofold, so that in such worlds sexual reproduction might be effected\r\n  by a more elaborate division of labour. Thus, in the cynical or\r\n  sceptical distinction between platonic, sexual, and licentious love,\r\n  we see the first traces of new and monstrous possibilities of sexual\r\n  union, on the one hand reflecting the sublimity of the supersensual,\r\n  and on the other more brutal than the most horrible sexual\r\n  aberration.”\r\n\r\nIn reality, it is only for normal heterosexual love between a normal man\r\nand a normal woman that it is possible to find an unimpeachable\r\nsanction. Only this love, continually more differentiated and more\r\nindividualized, will play a part in the future course of civilization.\r\n\r\nHeterosexuality arises from the reciprocal attraction and the\r\ncoalescence of the reproductive cells of two individuals of distinct\r\nsexes; it forms the foundation and constitutes the most important\r\nelement of the sexual relations of the higher animal world and of the\r\nhuman species; and it obtains through inheritance continually a more\r\nsharply defined expression. Since this fundamental phenomenon of the\r\nsexual impulse has been transmitted from the most ancient and simplest\r\nforms of the organic world and has been modified only in the direction\r\nof heterosexuality, it has come to pass, as Ewald Hering says at the end\r\nof his celebrated lecture on “Memory as a General Function of Organic\r\nMatter,” that organic matter has the strongest memory of the impulse of\r\nconjugation in its most ancient and most primitive form; thus this\r\nimpulse at the present day continues to dominate mankind as an intensely\r\npowerful physical imperative, endowed with the strength of an elemental\r\nforce, which, notwithstanding the gradually higher development of the\r\nbrain, has remained during thousands of years undiminished in its\r\npotency, and indeed by the accumulative influence extending through\r\nthousands of generations has acquired a notable increase in intensity.\r\nWe must assume that for untold generations always those animals and men\r\nhave had the most numerous descendants in whom the sexual impulse was\r\nthe most powerful; this powerful impulse being inherited, was\r\ntransmitted once more to the next generation, and tended by natural\r\nselection continually to increase.\r\n\r\nThis explanation of the indisputable gradual increase in the intensity\r\nof the sexual impulse, first given by the moral philosopher Paul Rée, is\r\nmore illuminating than the theory propounded by Havelock Ellis of the\r\nincrease of the sexual impulse by civilization, which was long ago\r\nmaintained by Lucretius (“De Rerum Naturâ,” V. 1016). In support of this\r\nlatter theory, it is asserted that among savage people the genital\r\norgans are less powerfully developed than among civilized races, but\r\nthis can by no means be regarded as an established fact. Civilization\r\nhas done no more than cause a fuller development of all sides of sexual\r\nlove by a multiplication of physical and psychical =stimuli=; but it\r\nappears extremely doubtful if civilization itself is to be regarded as\r\nthe immediate causal influence in the increase of the intensity of the\r\nsexual impulse.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving studied the elementary phenomena of human love dependent upon the\r\nphylogenetic history of the human race, namely the union of the male and\r\nfemale reproductive cells, the question now arises as to the nature of\r\nthe =psychical= processes, the character of the =sensations= that\r\naccompany this union of the sperm cells and the germ cells. What is the\r\nmost primitive =psychical elementary phenomenon= of love?\r\n\r\nIt is apparently that sensation in which the actual contact of the\r\npsyche with the material occurs--an immediate sensation of the nature of\r\nmatter--namely, the =sense of smell=. The metaphysical significance of\r\nthe sense of smell has been aptly indicated by describing that sense as\r\nthe “sublimated thing-in-itself,” as a sense which, like no other sense,\r\nallows us to enter immediately into the nature of matter; it is, in\r\nfact, the sense of personality.\r\n\r\n  “Smell,” says Heinrich Steffens, “is the principal sense of the higher\r\n  animals; it represents for them their own inner world; it envelops\r\n  their existence. Upon smell, wherein sympathy and antipathy are\r\n  represented, is based the whole security of the higher animal\r\n  instinct; =for carnal desire is comprehended in this sense=....\r\n  Indeed, in sexual union the subjective sensation which is developed by\r\n  means of smell blends completely with the objective, and from the\r\n  monistic union of the two arises the intenser libido, wherein the\r\n  unfathomableness of the procreative force and the whole power of sex\r\n  are absorbed.”\r\n\r\nErnst Haeckel ascribes to the two sexual cells a kind of inferior\r\npsychical activity; he believes that they experience a sensation of one\r\nanother’s proximity; and indeed it is probably a form of sensory\r\nactivity analogous to the sense of smell that draws them together. The\r\nsensation of the two sexual cells, which Haeckel believes to be situated\r\nespecially in the cell nuclei, he denotes by the term “erotic\r\nchemotropism.” He attributes it to an attraction of the nature of smell,\r\nand considers that it represents the psychical quintessence, the\r\noriginal being of love.\r\n\r\nA later investigator, Eugen Kröner, holds the same view. In the\r\nconjugation of two vorticellæ he recognizes the influence of the\r\nchemically operative sensation of smell; to him smell is the most\r\nimportant element in the sexual impulse of animals.\r\n\r\nThis theory is strongly supported, and indeed elevated to the rank of a\r\nnatural law, by the circumstance that in the higher animals the sense of\r\nsmell, in the course of phylogenetic development, has attained a\r\ncontinually greater significance in relation to sexuality; and by the\r\nfact that, according to the discovery of Zwaardemaker, there exists\r\nwidely diffused throughout Nature a =distinct group= of sexual odours,\r\nthe so-called =capryl odours=, which have a natural biological connexion\r\nwith the _vita sexualis._ These capryl odours, which already in plants\r\nplay a sexual part, are in animals and in the human species localized in\r\nor near the genital organs (odoriferous glands of the beaver, the\r\nmusk-ox, etc., the secretions of the male foreskin and the female\r\nvagina), or in other cases are found in the general secretions, such as\r\nthe sweat. Recently Gustav Klein has succeeded in proving that a\r\ndefinite group of glands in the female genital organs (glandulæ\r\nvestibulares majores, or glands of Bartholin) must be regarded as a\r\nvestige from the time of periodic sexual excitement (rutting). At that\r\ntime in the human species, as now in the lower animals, the sexual\r\nimpulse was periodic in its activity, and the secretion of these\r\nodoriferous glands of the human female then served as a means of\r\nalluring members of the male sex. At the present time these glands have\r\nfor the most part lost their significance as specific stimuli. Now it is\r\nrather the exhalation from the entire surface of the female body which\r\nexercises the erotic influence. Cases in which such stimuli proceed\r\nexclusively from the female genital organs are regarded by Klein as a\r\nphylogenetic vestige of the primitive relations between the rutting\r\nodours of the female and sexual excitement in the male. Friedrich S.\r\nKrauss, in his “Anthropophyteia” (1904, vol. i., p. 224), reproduces a\r\nSouthern Slavonic story in which a man is described who obtained sexual\r\ngratification only by enjoying the =natural= smell of the female genital\r\norgans. The remarkable classification of Indian women according to the\r\nvarious odours proceeding from their genital organs must not be\r\nforgotten in this connexion.\r\n\r\nThat this primitive phenomenon of love has even to-day a certain\r\nsignificance, although, in consequence of the enormous development of\r\nthe brain and the predominance of purely psychical elements in man, its\r\ninfluence has been very notably diminished, is shown by the existing\r\nphysiological connexion proved by Fliess to exist between the nose and\r\nthe genital organs. On the inferior turbinate bones there exist certain\r\n“genital areas,” which, under the influence of sexual stimulus and\r\nexcitement, as in coitus, during menstruation, etc., swell up. From\r\nthese areas it is also possible to influence directly certain conditions\r\nof the genital organs.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that civilization has to a large extent replaced the\r\nnatural sexual odours by artificial scents, so-called =perfumes=, whose\r\norigin is partly due to the =imitation= or =accentuation= of the natural\r\nodours, in part, however, and especially in recent times, to an\r\nendeavour to =conceal= these natural odours, especially when the latter\r\nare of a disagreeable character. For this reason, in addition to\r\npenetrating perfumes, such as civet, ambergris, musk, etc., we have also\r\nmild perfumes, for the most part vegetable in origin. The markedly\r\nexciting influence of these artificial scents is employed especially by\r\nwomen, above all by professional prostitutes, in order to excite men.[3]\r\nFrequently also the simple perfume of flowers suffices for this purpose.\r\nKrauss tells us that in the kolo-dance of the Southern Slavs the girls\r\nfasten strong-scented flowers and sprigs in the front of their dress,\r\nand thereby excite intense sexual desire in the young men. In the East\r\nsexual stimulation by means of the sense of smell plays a far more\r\nextensive rôle than in Europe.\r\n\r\nIn the human species, however, as a specific elementary phenomenon of\r\nsexual reproduction, smell has long been thrust into the background by\r\nthe strong development of other senses, especially that of sight. This\r\nfact is very clearly exhibited by the notable reduction which has\r\noccurred in the size of the organ of smell. In man the frontal lobes of\r\nthe brain, the seat of the highest intellectual processes and of speech,\r\nhave taken the place of the olfactory lobes in the lower animals.\r\nBesides, by means of clothing, the natural odours of men and women,\r\nwhich previously had such marked sexual significance, have been rendered\r\nalmost imperceptible, and nowadays sexual stimulation may result merely\r\nfrom the senses of touch and of sight, so that the hands and the lips\r\nand the female breasts have been transformed into erotic organs.\r\nNotwithstanding, however, the notable weakening of the sexual\r\nsignificance of smell, this most primitive sense (actually associated,\r\nas we have shown, with the activity of the germinal cells) will never\r\ncompletely cease to influence the sexual life.\r\n\r\n  “Still, there always surrounds us a now gently moving and now stormy\r\n  sea of odours, whose waves without cessation arouse in us feelings of\r\n  sympathy or antipathy, and to the minutest movements of which we are\r\n  not wholly indifferent” (Havelock Ellis).\r\n\r\nInasmuch as we have pointed out as the single primæval basis, as the\r\nmost important elementary phenomenon, of human love, the conjugation of\r\nthe male sperm cell with the female ovum (dependent probably upon a\r\nsensation analogous to that of smell), we denote this particular\r\nphenomenon of sexuality as =primary=, and we separate all the other\r\nphenomena as =secondary=, as more remote. Wilhelm Bölsche has also\r\nexpressed this difference by denoting the union of the two reproductive\r\ncells as “=fusion-love=,” whilst all that has occurred later, in the\r\ncourse of many thousands of years of evolution, and that has transformed\r\nthis primary process, by innumerable new influences, stimuli, and\r\nperceptions, into the love of modern civilized man, he denotes by the\r\napt name of “=distance-love=.”\r\n\r\nAccording to him,\r\n\r\n  “the ultimate act of love in a member of the most highly civilized\r\n  community assumes the form of a sudden withdrawal from the entire\r\n  world of surrounding artifacts, of alphabets, posts, telephones,\r\n  submarine cables, etc.... At this instant the principle of union is\r\n  once again victorious, as it were, in an ultimate posthumous vision in\r\n  a vital experience of a portion of primæval Nature, of the primæval\r\n  world, of an instant’s profoundest self-absorption into the great\r\n  mystery of the obscure original basis of Nature, to which neither time\r\n  nor old and new is known, but which is ever renewed in us in its\r\n  elemental force--the procreative principle. At this instant the loving\r\n  individual must return home to the heart of the all-mother--it is\r\n  useless to resist. It must draw from the fountain of youth--must\r\n  descend like Odin to the Norns, like Faust to the Mothers--=and there\r\n  all civilization is swallowed up; there cell body must join cell\r\n  body=, in order in the ardent embrace to reduce to a minimum the\r\n  distance which usually sunders such large bodies. Indeed, in reality\r\n  the sexual act goes further and deeper than this reduction of\r\n  separation to a minimum. Within the body of one of the partners of the\r\n  sexual act the ovum and the spermatozoon undergo an ultimate =perfect\r\n  fusion= of soul and body, in comparison with which even the closest\r\n  approximation of the great halves of the love partnership is no more\r\n  than a mere mechanical apposition. The ultimate aim of the loving\r\n  union is attained only in the coalescence of ovum and spermatozoon.”\r\n\r\nTo express the matter briefly, fusion-love fulfils the purpose of the\r\nspecies, while distance-love subserves rather the purpose of the\r\nindividual. Thus the natural course of the development of love, which in\r\nthe next chapter we propose to follow further, affords already the proof\r\nof the thesis propounded in the introduction regarding the duplicate\r\nnature of human love.\r\n\r\n  [3] According to Laurent (“Morbid Love,” pp. 133, 134, Leipzig, 1895),\r\n  common prostitutes generally use musk; young working women, violet or\r\n  rose-water; ladies of the bourgeoisie, penetrating perfumes, such as\r\n  white heliotrope, jasmine, and ylang-ylang; women of the half-world,\r\n  finer perfumes, or such “as are complex, like their own mode of\r\n  life”--for example, lily-of-the-valley, or mignonette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE SECONDARY PHENOMENA OF LOVE (BRAIN AND SENSES)\r\n\r\n\r\n“_From these considerations it follows that man, in the course of his\r\nphylogenetic development extending through lengthy geological periods,\r\nhas lost numerous advantages; and the question arises whether, in\r\nexchange for these, he may not also have gained certain other\r\nadvantages. Such must, indeed, have been the case if the human species\r\nwas to remain capable of survival. There has been a_ process of\r\nexchange, _by means of which man has gained an equivalent for all the\r\nqualities he has lost. And the gain consists in the_ unlimited\r\nplasticity of his brain. _By this he is fully compensated for the loss\r\nof the large and long series of advantages which his remote predecessors\r\npossessed._”--R.

This inevitably results from the nature of the human organism\r\nas a cell society, from the development of man as one of the order of\r\nmammalia, and finally from man’s elevation above the other mammalia as a\r\nbeing of enormously enhanced brain powers. The complex of these\r\nsecondary physical and psychical phenomena of love, dependent upon the\r\nprocess of evolution, has, as we have already said, been denoted by W.\r\nBölsche by the apt name of “distance-love,” which he thus distinguishes\r\nfrom the primary elemental phenomenon of “fusion-love.” These superadded\r\nelements play an extremely important part in human civilization, and,\r\nindeed, actually characterize that civilization which is in no way\r\ndependent on the primitive qualities shared by man with plants and lower\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nThis secondary sexuality of mankind is, in correspondence with the\r\ndifferentiation of the various organs of his body, extremely\r\ncomplicated, and it is by no means solely dependent upon the structure\r\nof the special =reproductive= or =copulatory= organs; it is also\r\nintimately connected with other parts of the body, and more especially\r\nwith the sense organs and the nervous system. Thus it has accommodated\r\nitself to all the external influences to which the species has been\r\nsubjected in the long course of its development history. We may say that\r\nthe =criterion, the characteristic mark of distinction between the human\r\nbody and that of the lower animals, is also the distinctive differential\r\ncharacteristic between human sexuality and that of the lower animals=.\r\nAnd this criterion is the =brain=.\r\n\r\nThe present physical and mental constitution of man is the result of an\r\nevolutionary process, of which the most marked characteristic has been a\r\ncontinually more rapid increase in the size and complexity of the brain.\r\nPhylogeny and ontogeny clearly demonstrate the evolution of the human\r\nbody from lower states to higher, the slow but sure improvement in the\r\ndirection of a continual enlargement and increasing convolution of the\r\nbrain, which has by no means yet attained finality, but which may be\r\nexpected to continue into the far-distant future; and associated with\r\nthis physical development will undoubtedly proceed an equally extensive\r\nimprovement in the quality of human consciousness.\r\n\r\nThis progressive development of the brain has resulted in a\r\nretrogression and arrest of development of other parts and organs, and\r\namong these some more or less closely associated with the sexual\r\nfunctions, and originally of considerable importance. Gegenbaur, in his\r\n“Anatomy,” and Wiedersheim, in his interesting work on “The Structure of\r\nMan as Bearing Witness to his Past,” recognize in the unlimited\r\nplasticity of the human brain the sole cause of the arrest of\r\ndevelopment and retrogressive metamorphosis of many organs and functions\r\nwhich persist in other members of the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\nIn the sexual life, also, in correspondence with this preponderating\r\ndevelopment of the brain, purely psychical elements continually play a\r\nlarger part, whilst parts and functions at one time intimately related\r\nto sexuality have undergone atrophy. Thus, as we have already pointed\r\nout, the human organ of smell had unquestionably in earlier times much\r\ngreater significance in relation to the _vita sexualis_ than it has at\r\nthe present day. Wiedersheim shows that in the ancestors of the human\r\nrace this organ was much more extensively developed, and that it must\r\nnow be regarded as in a state of atrophy. The mammary glands, the\r\noriginal function of which was perhaps the production of odoriferous\r\nsubstances, but which later became devoted solely to the secretion of\r\nmilk, existed in our ancestors in a larger number than in the present\r\nhuman race. This is clearly shown by the fact that the human embryo\r\nnormally exhibits a “hyperthelia,” an excess of breasts, of which,\r\nhowever, two only normally undergo development; moreover, the breasts of\r\nthe male, which are now in a state of arrested development, were\r\nformerly better developed, and served, like those of the female, the\r\npurpose of nourishing the offspring. These facts are clearly explicable\r\non the assumption that at one time the number of offspring at a single\r\nbirth was considerable, and that in this way the preservation of the\r\nspecies was favoured (Wiedersheim).\r\n\r\nIt is a very interesting fact that the principal “organ of\r\nvoluptuousness” in women, the clitoris, is notably diminished in size\r\nabsolutely and relatively as compared with the clitoris of apes. It\r\ncertainly no longer represents an organ so susceptible to voluptuous\r\nstimulation and excitement as it was assumed to be by the older\r\nphysicians and physiologists; so that, for example, Van Swieten, the\r\ncelebrated body physician of the Empress Maria Theresa, recommended\r\n_titillatio clitoridis_ as the most certain means of curing the sexual\r\ninsensibility of his royal patient.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the common variations in the external configuration of the\r\nfemale genital organs, which Rudolf Bergh has very fully and minutely\r\ndescribed in his “Symbolæ ad Cognitionem Genitalium Externorum\r\nFemineorum,” are largely dependent on such arrests of development,\r\nwhich, indeed, occur also in the male.\r\n\r\nA very remarkable phenomenon in the course of human evolution has been\r\nthe =diminution in the hairy covering of the body=. As compared with the\r\nother mammalia, especially those most nearly allied to man--the\r\nanthropoid apes--man is relatively bald. This baldness has been\r\n=gradually acquired=, and seems likely to progress further in the\r\nfuture. Numerous hypotheses have been propounded regarding the purpose\r\nand true cause of this progressive atrophy of the hairy covering which\r\noriginally extended over the entire surface of the body. The effect of\r\ntropical climate will not suffice to account for the change, for in the\r\ntropics the hairy covering is useful for a covering against the rays of\r\nthe sun--witness the thick hairy coat of the tropical apes. More apt is\r\nthe idea of sexual selection, advanced by Darwin in explanation of the\r\nloss of hair. According to this theory, the comparatively balder women\r\nwere preferred by the men to those with a thicker covering of hair.\r\nHelbig raises the objection that primitive man in sexual intercourse\r\nwould observe only the genital organs and the parts in their immediate\r\nneighbourhood. Yet in this region the sexually mature woman has retained\r\na portion of the hairy covering of the body. We must therefore, in order\r\nto rescue the idea of sexual selection as an explanation of the\r\nincreasing baldness of the human race, assume that primitive man had\r\ncultivated æsthetic tastes, and was not an extremely sensual person, and\r\nthat in his choice of a partner he would be guided by the appearance of\r\nthe woman’s entire body. This, however, is a very questionable\r\nassumption. Very doubtful also is the suggested connexion between\r\nlargely developed dentition and the baldness of the skin (Helbig). More\r\napposite is W. Bölsche’s view that the atrophy of the human hairy\r\ncovering is related to the adoption of an =artificial covering=. Since\r\nthat time the thick hairy covering of the skin was felt to be\r\nburdensome, since it hindered perspiration beneath the clothing, and\r\nalso favoured the harbouring of parasites, fleas, lice, etc., which play\r\nso large a part in the annoyance of all hair-covered mammals. In these\r\ncircumstances bareness of skin became an ideal to primitive man. By\r\nrubbing away the hair beneath the clothes, by cutting it short, and by\r\npulling it out by the roots, an artificial baldness was produced; this\r\nthen became an ideal of beauty. Thus it happened in the choice of a\r\npartner that those individuals less hairy than others were preferred,\r\nand thus gradually by this process of sexual selection the race became\r\ncontinually less hairy, until ultimately the relative baldness of the\r\npresent day was attained.\r\n\r\nIn certain parts of the body, especially in the armpits and in the\r\nneighbourhood of the external genital organs, the thick hairy covering\r\nhas been retained. This may, perhaps, be dependent upon the fact that\r\nfrom the axillary and pubic hair certain erotic stimuli proceed, more\r\nespecially certain odours. In fact, it is possible that the hair of\r\nthose regions in which strong-smelling secretions were produced have\r\nplayed the part of scent-sprinklers, analogous to the “perfume brushes”\r\nof butterflies.\r\n\r\nIn a similar way, the preservation of an exceptionally rich development\r\nof the hair of a woman’s head may be explained by the fact that\r\ntherefrom erotically stimulating odours unquestionably proceed. This\r\ncircumstance has influenced sexual selection in the direction of the\r\npreservation and continual increase in the length of the hair of a\r\nwoman’s head; while, in the opposite direction, and equally by the\r\nprocess of sexual selection, the female body has been much more fully\r\ndeprived of hair than that of the male.\r\n\r\nIt seems, however, that this process of loss of hair is not yet\r\ncompleted. The male beard has already ceased to play the part of a\r\nsexual lure, which it formerly undoubtedly possessed. Schopenhauer’s\r\nopinion, that with the advance of civilization the beard will disappear,\r\nprobably represents the truth; he regarded shaving as a sign of the\r\nhigher civilization. It is certainly a logical postulate of the natural\r\ncourse of development.[4]\r\n\r\nHavelock Ellis, in “Man and Woman,” comes to the conclusion that the\r\nbodily development of our race is a progress in the direction of a\r\nyouthful type. This is merely another way of expressing the fact that\r\nin the case of many organs and systems, and more especially in the case\r\nof the hairy covering of the skin, an arrest of development has\r\noccurred, and it is a recognition of the fact that the retrogressive\r\nmetamorphosis of these organs is a compensation for the dominating and\r\nenormous development of the brain.\r\n\r\nParallel with this development of the brain there has occurred a\r\nprogressive development of sexuality from the lowest animal instinct to\r\nthe highest human “love.” The way of the spirit in love becomes\r\npredominant _pari passu_ with the development of mankind in\r\ncivilization. There is a profound meaning in the saying of Schopenhauer\r\nthat the transformation of the sexual impulse into passionate love\r\nrepresents the victory of the intelligence over the will. And when\r\nanother writer of genius has described the history of civilization as\r\nthe history of the progress of mankind from nearer to =more remote=,\r\nmore spiritual stimuli of pleasure, this is above all true of human\r\nlove.\r\n\r\nIn lower states of human love these spiritual elements are undoubtedly\r\nwanting. Amongst primitive men the manifestations of sexuality can have\r\ndiffered in no wise from those of the animals most nearly related to\r\nthem. Their love was still a pure animal instinct. The Asiatic myth\r\nwhich divided the earliest periods of human history in this way,\r\nasserting that the inhabitants of paradise loved for thousands of years\r\nmerely by means of glances, later by a kiss, by simple physical contact,\r\nuntil ultimately they underwent a “fall” through adopting the debased\r\nmethods of common animal sexual indulgence--this infantile mythology\r\nwould be accurate enough if one inverted the series of stages in the\r\nevolution of love.\r\n\r\nThis view is confirmed by the fact that, according to the most recent\r\ninvestigation into the history of primitive man, it is extremely\r\nprobable that to palæolithic man of the earlier diluvial period the idea\r\nof the spiritual was still completely unknown--that palæolithic man was,\r\nin fact, purely a creature of impulse--an opinion already maintained by\r\nDarwin in his work on the “Descent of Man.” In the sexual instinct,\r\nabove all, every dualistic division into physical and spiritual was\r\nentirely foreign to primitive man. The more primitive the state of\r\ncivilization, the less is the idea “love” known, a fact first\r\nestablished by Lubbock. Even at the present day, in regard to this\r\nmatter, there is a notable difference between the upper and the lower\r\nclasses in a European civilized community. For example, Elard Hugo\r\nMeyer, in his excellent “Deutsche Volkskunde” (“German Folk-lore,” p.\r\n152; Strasburg, 1898), states that from Eastern Friesland to the Alps\r\namongst the common people the word “love,” to us so indispensable and so\r\nexalted, is entirely unknown; in its place words expressing rather the\r\nsensual side of the impulse are employed.\r\n\r\nRousseau suggested that primitive man embraced primitive woman only in\r\nthe fugitive moments of domination by his instinctive impulse. It is no\r\ndoubt very probable that primæval man shared with other animals the\r\nperiodicity of the sexual impulse; this periodicity disappeared only in\r\nthe subsequent course of human development, and traces of it yet remain.\r\nIt is probable that this periodicity of the sexual impulse was\r\nassociated with variations in the supply of nutriment, and was thus, as\r\nDarwin assumes, a kind of natural obstacle to too rapid an increase in\r\nthe population. Later, in consequence of an increase in individual\r\nsecurity, and of a more enduring supply of abundant nutriment, such\r\nperiodic rutting ceased to occur, or was preserved only in the form of\r\nmenstruation (ovulation) in women, in whom at this period there is a\r\nperceptible increase in sexual excitability. =Among savage races this\r\nperiodicity of the sexual impulse, its increase at definite seasons of\r\nthe year, is still clearly manifested even in the male.= Heape and\r\nHavelock Ellis have carefully studied this primitive phenomenon, and\r\nhave adduced numerous proofs of its truth.[5]\r\n\r\nOnly the human female experiences true “menstruation”; that is to say,\r\nonly in women is the maturation of the ovum accompanied by a monthly\r\ndischarge of blood from the genital passage. The so-called menstruation\r\nof female apes is limited to a periodic swelling of the external\r\ngenital organs, with a mucous discharge therefrom. According to\r\nMetchnikoff, the menstruation of apes constitutes the intermediate stage\r\nbetween the rutting of the lower animals and the menstruation of the\r\nhuman female. This latter is a new acquisition, the purpose of which is\r\nperhaps the limitation of fertility and the prevention of the\r\nexcessively early marriage of girls.\r\n\r\nWith the advanced development of the brain, the old periodic rutting, of\r\nwhich rudiments still persist, became more and more subordinate to the\r\nconscious will, was transformed more and more into enduring love.\r\nCharles Letourneau writes:\r\n\r\n  “If we go to the root of the matter, we find that human love is in its\r\n  essence merely the rutting season in a reasoning being; it increases\r\n  all the vital forces of the human being, just as rutting increases\r\n  those of the lower animals. If love apparently differs enormously from\r\n  rutting, this is merely due to the fact that the reproductive impulse,\r\n  the most primitive of all impulses, becomes in developed nerve centres\r\n  more diffuse in its sphere of operations, and thus in man awakens and\r\n  excites a whole province of psychical life which is entirely unknown\r\n  to the lower animals.”\r\n\r\nPhilosophers and scientific observers have defined the distinction\r\nbetween human and animal love as consisting in the fact that man can\r\nlove at all times, the animal periodically only; but this distinction\r\ncertainly does not apply to the beginnings of human development; it\r\noriginates beyond question with the =first appearance of the spiritual\r\nelement in love=. This alone makes man capable of enduring love, this\r\nalone frees him from dependence upon periodic rutting seasons. The\r\n=prolongation= of love by the introduction of the spiritual element was\r\nalready pointed out by Kant, whose writings (especially the lesser ones)\r\nare rich in valuable observations of a similar kind. In his treatise\r\npublished in 1786, “The Probable Beginning of Human History,” he says\r\nregarding the sexual instinct:\r\n\r\n  “Reason, as soon as it had become active, did not delay to exert its\r\n  influence also in the sexual sphere. Man soon discovered that the\r\n  stimulus of sex, which in animals depended merely on a transient and\r\n  for the most part periodic impulse, was in his own case =capable of\r\n  prolongation, and indeed of increase, by the force of imagination=.\r\n  This influence works more moderately, it is true, but with more\r\n  persistence and more evenness the more the affair is withdrawn from\r\n  the dominion of the senses, so that the satiety produced by the\r\n  gratification of a purely animal passion is avoided.”\r\n\r\nThis important question regarding the origin of the love of human beings\r\nas contrasted with the periodic instinct of the lower animals and\r\nprimitive man has hitherto, strangely enough, hardly received any\r\nattention, notwithstanding the fact that it is one of the most important\r\nevolutionary problems in the history of human civilization, and\r\nrepresents to a certain extent the only problem in the primitive history\r\nof love.\r\n\r\nThe =principal= cause of the perennial nature of human love, as\r\ncontrasted with the periodic character of the sexual impulse of the\r\nlower animals, must, as Kant says, be sought in the appearance of these\r\npsychical relations between the sexes. Hypotheses such as that put\r\nforward by Dr. W. Rheinhard in his book, “Man considered as an Animal\r\nSpecies, and his Impulses,” according to which the prolonged\r\n=separation= of the sexes, consequent on the increased difficulty in the\r\nprovision of sufficient nutriment (more especially in the Ice Age), led\r\nto an incomplete satisfaction of the sexual impulse during the rutting\r\nseason, and thus gave rise to an =enduring= sexual excitement, cannot be\r\ntreated seriously. The same author suggests that the excessive\r\n=consumption of meat= of the Ice Age, owing to the absence of vegetable\r\nfood, was responsible for the stronger stimulation of the sexual\r\nimpulse, and for its prolongation beyond the rutting season.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably Kant’s explanation is the only true one; it is the one\r\nwhich Schiller had in his mind when in his essay on the connexion\r\nbetween the animal and the spiritual nature of man, he spoke of the\r\nhappiness of the animals as of such a kind that\r\n\r\n  “it is dependent merely upon the periods of the organism, and these\r\n  are subject to chance, to blind hazard, because this happiness rests\r\n  solely on sensation.”\r\n\r\nThe sexual love of primitive man was, like this, purely instinctive and\r\nimpulsive.\r\n\r\nFor him, beginning, course, and end, of every love-process was “directly\r\n=linear=, with no to-and-fro oscillations into the indefinite province\r\nof the transcendental.” The need for love and the satisfaction of that\r\nneed were in primitive man entirely limited to the physical process of\r\nsexual activity (L. Jacobowski, “The Beginnings of Poetry,” p. 84).\r\n\r\nIt was the interpenetration of the whole of sexuality with spiritual\r\nelements which first interrupted this single line of sensation, making\r\nin a sense two lines: hence arose the frequently unhappy dualism between\r\nbody and mind in our experience of love; and yet at the same time it was\r\nthe cause of the elevation of human love to purely =individual=\r\nfeelings, which, extending far beyond the purposes of reproduction,\r\nsubserved the spiritual demands of the loving individual himself.[6]\r\n\r\nNatural science, and especially the doctrine of descent, have shown that\r\nin the higher animal world, to which we have proved primitive man\r\nbelongs, a =complication= of the sexual impulse exists as compared to\r\nthis condition in lower forms; this complication consists mainly in the\r\nintimate association of =sensory stimuli= with the sexual impulse. In a\r\nspeech to monks, reported in the Pali Canon, Buddha has well described\r\nthe sexual part played by the various senses:\r\n\r\n  “I do not know, young men, any other =form= which fetters the heart of\r\n  man like a woman’s form.\r\n\r\n  “A woman’s form, young men, fetters the heart of man.\r\n\r\n  “I do not know, young men, any other =voice= which fetters the heart\r\n  of man like the voice of woman.\r\n\r\n  “The voice of woman, young men, fetters the heart of man.\r\n\r\n  “I do not know, young men, any other =odour= which fetters the heart\r\n  of man like the odour of woman.\r\n\r\n  “The odour of woman, young men, fetters the heart of man.\r\n\r\n  “I do not know, young men, any other =taste= which fetters the heart\r\n  of man like the taste of woman.\r\n\r\n  “The taste of woman, young men, fetters the heart of man.\r\n\r\n  “I do not know, young men, any =touch= which fetters the heart of man\r\n  like the touch of woman.\r\n\r\n  “The touch of woman, young men, fetters the heart of man.”\r\n\r\nThen there follows, in the same rhythmical form, an enumeration of the\r\nsexual stimuli emanating from woman through eye, ear, smell, taste, and\r\ntouch.\r\n\r\nAssociated with the progress towards “love” of this sexual impulse\r\nenriched by sensory stimuli was a =preponderance=, a prevalence, of\r\ncertain particular sensory stimuli. Herein are certainly to be found the\r\nbeginnings of a spiritualization of purely animal instincts and\r\nimpulses.\r\n\r\nThe most important part in the amatory life of man is played, even at\r\nthe present day, by the sense of touch, and by the two higher senses,\r\nsight and hearing, these two latter containing so many spiritual\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nThe =sense of touch= is more widely extended in space than the other\r\nsenses, and for this reason touch is quantitatively the most excitable\r\nof the senses. The stimulation of the sensory nerves of the skin, the\r\nenormous number of which suffices to explain the richness of sensation\r\nthrough the skin, experienced as touch, tickling, or slight pain,\r\ntransmits very similar sensations to the voluptuous sensorium. The\r\nrelationship between these various modes of sensation is confirmed by\r\nthe fact that the terminals of the sensory nerves of the skin, the\r\nso-called corpuscles of Vater or Pacini, closely resemble in structure\r\nthe corpuscles of Krause found on the glans penis and glans clitoridis,\r\non the prepuce of the clitoris, the labia majora, and on the papillæ of\r\nthe red margin of the lip. From this point of view, the entire skin may\r\nbe regarded as a huge organ of voluptuous sensation, of which the skin\r\nof the external organs of conjugation is most strongly susceptible to\r\nstimulation.\r\n\r\nMantegazza therefore describes sexual love as a higher form of tactile\r\nsensation. In human beings of a baser disposition love is no more than a\r\ntouch. Between the chaste stroking of the hair and the violent storm of\r\nthe sexual orgasm there is a quantitative, but not a qualitative\r\ndifference. The sense of touch is a profoundly sexual sense, which at\r\nthe present day plays much the same part as was in primitive times\r\nplayed by the sense of smell.\r\n\r\n  “The skin,” says Wilhelm Bölsche, “became the great procurer, the\r\n  dominant intermediary of love, for the multicellular animals, in which\r\n  complete conjugation of the cell bodies had become impossible, so that\r\n  their sexual gratification had to be obtained by distance-love, by\r\n  contact-love. Thus the skin was the primitive area of voluptuous\r\n  sensation, the arena of the supreme bodily triumph of this\r\n  distance-love.”\r\n\r\nIt has been well said that the first intentional touching of a part of\r\nthe skin of the loved one is already a half-sexual union; and this view\r\nis confirmed by the fact that such intimate bodily contacts, even when\r\nthey occur between parts far distant from sexual organs, very speedily\r\nlead to states of marked excitement of these organs. Quite rightly,\r\ntherefore, the pleasurable sensations aroused by means of cutaneous\r\nsensibility are regarded by Magnus Hirschfeld as the stages of\r\ntransition along which the power of self-command and the capacity for\r\nresisting the impulses arising out of the transformation of sensory\r\nperceptions into movements and actions most commonly break down. He who\r\navoids these first contacts, best protects himself against the danger\r\nof being overpowered by his sexual impulse, and of blindly following\r\nwhere that impulse leads--if, for example, he wishes to avoid\r\nintercourse with a person whom he suspects to be suffering from some\r\nvenereal disease.\r\n\r\nAreas of skin more especially susceptible to sexual stimulation, the\r\nso-called erogenic areas, are those parts of the body where skin and\r\nmucous membrane meet--above all therefore the lips, but also the region\r\nof the anus, the female genital organs, and the nipples of the female\r\nbreast. That in certain circumstances even the eye may be an erogenic\r\nzone is shown by the remarkable observation of Dr. Emil Bock, that in\r\nmany female patients a gentle inunction of Pagenstecher’s ointment into\r\nthe eye gives rise to changes of countenance showing that a sexual\r\norgasm is occurring.\r\n\r\nThe contact of the lips in the =kiss= is one of the most powerful\r\nstimuli of love.[7] An Arabian author of the sixteenth century (Sheikh\r\nNefzawi) in his work, “The Perfumed Garden,” an Arabian _ars amandi_,\r\nalludes to this fact. He quotes the verses of an Arabian poet:\r\n\r\n  “When the heart burns with love,\r\n   It finds, alas, nowhere a cure;\r\n   No witch’s magic art\r\n   Will give the heart that for which it thirsts;\r\n   The working of no charm\r\n   Will perform the desired miracle;\r\n   And the most intimate embrace\r\n   Leaves the heart cold and unsatisfied--\r\n   If the rapture of the kiss is wanting.”\r\n\r\nThe physiologist Burdach, influenced by the then dominant natural\r\nphilosophy of Schelling, defined the kiss as “the symbol of the union of\r\nsouls,” analogous to “the galvanic contact between a positively and a\r\nnegatively electrified body; it increases sexual polarity, permeates the\r\nentire body, and if impure transfers sin from one individual to the\r\nother.” Goethe has very perspicuously described sexual union in a kiss:\r\n\r\n  “Eagerly she sucks the flames of his mouth:\r\n   Each is conscious only of the other.”\r\n\r\nAnd Byron writes:\r\n\r\n  “A long, long kiss, a kiss of youth and love,\r\n   And beauty, all concentrating like rays\r\n   Into one focus kindled from above;\r\n   Such kisses as belong to early days,\r\n   Where heart and soul and sense in concert move,\r\n   And the blood’s lava, and the pulse a blaze,\r\n   Each kiss a heart-quake--for a kiss’s strength,\r\n   I think it must be reckoned by its length.”\r\n\r\nIt is therefore a true saying, that a woman who permits a man to kiss\r\nher will ultimately grant him complete possession.[8] Moreover, by the\r\nmajority of finely sensitive women the kiss is valued just as highly as\r\nthe last favour.[9]\r\n\r\nThe problem of the =origin= of the kiss, which Scheffel, in his book\r\n(“Trompeter von Säckingen”), has treated in humorous verse, has recently\r\nbeen investigated by the methods of natural science. The lip kiss is\r\npeculiar to man and in him the impulse to kiss is not innate, but has\r\nbeen gradually developed, and the kiss has only acquired by degrees a\r\nrelation to the sexual sphere.\r\n\r\nHavelock Ellis has recently made an interesting investigation regarding\r\nthe origin of the kiss, and has proved that the love kiss has developed\r\nfrom the primitive maternal kiss and from the sucking of the infant at\r\nthe maternal breast,[10] which are customary in regions where the sexual\r\nkiss is unknown. Both the sense of touch and the sense of smell play a\r\npart in this primitive kiss, and to simple contact primitive man\r\nsuperadded both licking and biting. This primitive physiological sadism\r\nof the biting kiss was probably inherited from the lower animals, which\r\nwhen copulating often bite one another (Kleist in “Penthesilea” writes\r\n“Küsse”--kissing--rhymes with “Bisse”--biting). Earlier authors--as, for\r\nexample, Mohnike, in his admirable essay on the sexual instinct--have\r\ninferred from the existence of these passionate accompaniments of the\r\nkiss that the latter has an intimate connexion with the nutritive\r\nimpulse. We have indeed the familiar expression, “I could eat you for\r\nlove.” Indeed, according to Mohnike, the frenzy of the wild kisses of\r\npassionate love may actually lead to anthropophagy, as in a case\r\nreported by Metzger, in which a young man on his wedding night actually\r\nbit and began to devour his wife. Although in this case we doubtless\r\nhave to do with an insane individual, such sadistic feelings in a lesser\r\ndegree are so often observed in association with kissing that they may\r\nbe regarded as physiological.[11]\r\n\r\nIn the novel “Hunger,” by Knut Hamsun, the author describes a peculiar\r\nrelationship between hunger and the _libido sexualis_. Georg Lomer also,\r\nin the beginning of his thoughtful work, “Love and Psychosis”\r\n(Wiesbaden, 1907), expresses the opinion that hunger and love are not\r\nopposites, but that one is rather the completion, the larval state, or\r\nthe sublimation, of the other. In certain species of spiders the male\r\nruns the danger, when performing his share in sexual congress, of being\r\nactually devoured by the stronger female.\r\n\r\nThe kiss by contact between the lips or neighbouring parts of the skin\r\nis of European origin, and even here is a comparatively recent practice,\r\nfor the ancients very rarely allude to it. Its erotic significance was\r\nearly pointed out by Indian, Oriental, and Roman poets. Amongst the\r\nMongol races the so-called olfactory kiss (“smell-kiss”) is in much more\r\ncommon use. In this the nose is apposed to the cheek of the beloved\r\nperson, and the expired air and the odour arising from the cheek are\r\ninhaled.\r\n\r\nWith the diffusion of European civilization, the European kiss of\r\ncontact has also been diffused. It is no longer possible to determine\r\nwhether the peculiar connexion between the lips and the genital organs,\r\nas manifested for example by the growth of hair on the upper lip at\r\npuberty in the male sex, and also by the well-known thick “sensual” lips\r\noften seen in individuals with exceptionally powerful sexual impulses,\r\nis originally primary, or merely a secondary result of the employment of\r\nthe lips in a sexual caress.[12]\r\n\r\nTo our consideration of the kiss we may naturally append a few remarks\r\non the rôle of the =sense of taste= in human love. Inasmuch as taste is\r\nalmost invariably closely connected with smell, we are rarely able to\r\nprove in an individual case whether an impression of taste or an\r\nimpression of smell more powerfully affects the _vita sexualis_. In\r\nkissing, an unconscious tasting of the beloved person seems often to\r\nplay a part; and as regards the kissing of other parts of the body,\r\nespecially the genital organs, at the acme of sexual excitement this\r\nundoubtedly often occurs. In Norwegian folk-tales, and in a South\r\nHungarian song published by Friedrich S. Krauss, this tasting of the\r\nwoman is very realistically described. The taste for sweets has also\r\nbeen largely associated with sexuality. Children who are fond of sweets,\r\nwho have, as it is called, a sweet tooth, are also sensually disposed,\r\nsexually more excitable, and more inclined to the practice of onanism,\r\nthan other children. The sensory impulses have therefore been classified\r\nas the hunger impulse and the sexual impulse respectively. A certain\r\namount of truth appears to lie in these observations.\r\n\r\nMuch greater influence than these lower senses possess is exerted in the\r\nsexual sphere on modern civilized man by the higher, truly\r\n=intellectual= senses, =sight= and =hearing=. With the adoption of the\r\nupright posture they gained an advantage over the sense of smell and\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\nIn his work “Ideas Concerning the Philosophy of Human History” Herder\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n  “In the beginning all the senses of man had but a small area of\r\n  action, and =the lower senses were more active than the higher=. We\r\n  see this among savages of the present day: smell and taste are their\r\n  guides, as they are in the case of the lower animals. But when man is\r\n  raised above the earth and the undergrowth, smell is no longer in\r\n  command, but the eye: it has a wider kingdom, and accustoms itself\r\n  from early childhood to the finest geometry of lines and colours. The\r\n  ear, deeply placed beneath the projecting skull, has closer access to\r\n  the inner chamber for the collection of ideas, whilst in the lower\r\n  animals the ear stands upright, and in many is so formed as to point\r\n  in the direction of the sound.”\r\n\r\nSmell, taste, and even touch, have but little æsthetic value as compared\r\nwith the two higher senses, because in the former the material\r\npreponderates too greatly, and because they are more closely related\r\nwith the pure animal impulses than are sight and hearing. Johannes\r\nVolkelt, in his valuable work “Æsthetics,” has carried on an interesting\r\ninvestigation of this question, and comes to the conclusion that in\r\nsight and hearing perception proceeds without any trace of the material;\r\nin touch and taste, on the other hand, the material enormously\r\npredominates, whilst smell stands between. Schiller wrote:\r\n\r\n  “In the case of the eye and the ear the surrounding matter is rejected\r\n  by the senses; for this reason, these two senses give the freest\r\n  æsthetic enjoyment unalloyed with animal lust.”\r\n\r\nThe sense of sight is a true æsthetic sense in relation to the _vita\r\nsexualis_; it is the first messenger of love. By means of this sense,\r\ncolour and form become sexual stimuli: by the sense of sight the entire\r\nimpression of the beloved personality is first conveyed; sympathy and\r\nsexual attraction are almost always at first dependent upon sight. In\r\nregard to love’s choice, sight is unquestionably the sense of the\r\ngreatest importance.\r\n\r\nAccording to researches guided by the light of the modern doctrine of\r\nevolution, we can no longer doubt that the beauty of the living world is\r\nintimately connected with the sexual life, and is indeed by this first\r\ncalled into being. All beauty is, to use the words of Darwin and P. J.\r\nMöbius, “love become capable of perception,” and, let us ourselves add,\r\nlove become capable of perception by means of the sense of sight. The\r\nfigure, the carriage, the gait, the clothing, the adornment, the\r\nobservation of the beauties of the various parts of the body of the\r\nbeloved person--all these impressions, received by means of the sense of\r\nsight, have the most powerful erotic influence.\r\n\r\nHavelock Ellis also comes to the conclusion that for mankind the ideal\r\nof a suitable love-partner is based far more upon the =data of the sense\r\nof sight= than upon those of touch, smell, and hearing.\r\n\r\nHowever, in addition to the sense of sight, the sense of hearing plays a\r\npart of considerable importance in the amatory life of mankind. A\r\nsufficient indication of this fact is given by the change occurring in a\r\nman’s voice at the time of puberty. Darwin’s classical investigations\r\nprove beyond a possibility of doubt the intimate relationship between\r\nthe voice and sexual life. The masculine voice, especially, has a\r\nsexually stimulating effect upon woman; but the converse influence of a\r\nwoman’s voice upon man may also be observed. In the other mammalia, it\r\nis especially in the rutting season that the voice is used as a means of\r\nsexual allurement. The repetition of this vocal lure at measured\r\nintervals gives rise to rhythm and song. The rhythmical repetition of\r\nthe same tone possesses something highly suggestive, fascinating, and so\r\ngives rise to sexual attraction and charm in the most powerful manner.\r\nHere lies the origin of the profound erotic influence of singing and\r\nmusic. Darwin assumes that the early progenitors of mankind, before they\r\nhad acquired the faculty of expressing their mutual love in articulate\r\nspeech, used to charm one another by musical tones and rhythms. Woman\r\nis far more susceptible than man to the sexual influence of singing or\r\nmusic, but man himself is by no means indifferent to the charms of the\r\nbeautiful feminine voice. The soft tones of a woman’s voice are, for\r\nmany men, the first enthralling disclosure of woman’s nature. The French\r\nphysician and natural philosopher Moreau relates that he was once\r\ncompelled to renounce the pleasure of seeing the performance of a\r\nbeautiful actress, for only thus could he overcome a violent outburst of\r\nsexual passion which was evoked in him by the mere stimulus of her\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n  [4] If at the present day an inquiry were instituted among the\r\n  cultured women of European and Anglo-American descent, whether bearded\r\n  or beardless men more nearly corresponded to their ideal of beauty,\r\n  there can be little doubt that the majority--perhaps a very large\r\n  majority--would declare against a full beard.\r\n\r\n  [5] Recently, apart from sexual periodicity, a general periodicity of\r\n  vital manifestations, more especially of the psychical phenomena\r\n  associated with sexuality, has been proved to exist in both sexes. In\r\n  a work that attracted much attention--“The Course of Life: Elements of\r\n  Exact Biology” (Vienna, 1905)--Wilhelm Fliess proved the occurrence in\r\n  the human species of a twenty-three day “masculine,” and a\r\n  twenty-eight day “feminine” period. Not merely do physical phenomena\r\n  recur quite spontaneously at intervals of twenty-three and\r\n  twenty-eight days respectively, but the same is true of perceptions,\r\n  feelings, and voluntary impulses. Hermann Swoboda, a thoughtful\r\n  supporter of Fliess’s theory, has treated this question in two\r\n  works--“The Periods of the Human Organism in their Psychological and\r\n  Biological Significance” (Leipzig and Vienna, 1904), and “Studies in\r\n  the Elements of Psychology” (Leipzig and Vienna, 1905). In these he\r\n  has described also twenty-three-hour and eighteen-hour vital\r\n  undulations in human beings, and has discussed the significance of\r\n  this periodicity to psychology. These researches of Fliess and Swoboda\r\n  need to be confirmed by other investigators before they can be\r\n  regarded as definite additions to our scientific knowledge. In this\r\n  connexion also the older work of Carl Reinl--“Undulatory Movements of\r\n  the Vital Processes in Woman” (Leipzig, 1884)--may be consulted. See\r\n  also Van de Velde’s “Ovarian Functions, Undulatory Movement, and\r\n  Menstrual Hæmorrhage” (Jena, 1905).\r\n\r\n  [6] Virey likewise explains the enduring nature of human love as\r\n  dependent upon an excess of potent nutritive material, whereas the\r\n  poor savages of Northern Europe and America, who must often go hungry,\r\n  really experience no more than an instant of sexual pleasure, just\r\n  like the wild animals, who rut only at certain distinct seasons. For\r\n  the same reason, our domestic animals, which have a superfluous supply\r\n  of nutriment, copulate far more frequently. And in our own case, the\r\n  incessant intimate association of the sexes in our domestic life is a\r\n  continued source of ever-renewed sexual needs, even contrary to our\r\n  own will. The assumption of the =upright posture= by man, which is so\r\n  intimately connected with the preponderance of the human brain, is\r\n  also regarded by Virey as “an enduring cause of sexual excitement.”\r\n  _Cf._ J. J. Virey, “Das Weib” (“Woman”), p. 301; Leipzig, 1827.\r\n\r\n  [7] Recently Gualino [“Il Riflesso Sessuale nell’ Eccitamento alle\r\n  Labbra” (“The Sexual Reflex resulting from the Stimulation of the\r\n  Lips”), published in the Italian “Archives of Psychiatry,” 1904, p.\r\n  341 _et seq._] by mechanical stimulation of the red parts of the lips,\r\n  has produced erotic ideas and congestion of the genital organs, and\r\n  this proves that the lips are an erogenic zone. Compare also the\r\n  interesting remarks of Professor Petermann and Dr. Näcke on the origin\r\n  of the kiss, in the German “Archives of Criminal Anthropology,” 1904,\r\n  vol. xvi., pp. 356, 357.\r\n\r\n  [8] A kiss is on the boundary-line between erotism and sexual\r\n  enjoyment. Bölsche calls it the true transitional form between\r\n  fusion-love and distance-love. At the instant of the kiss the distance\r\n  between the two lovers is certainly reduced to a minimum; the\r\n  distance-love, therefore, is on the point of becoming fusion-love. On\r\n  the other hand, however, the kiss is still simply tactile contact, and\r\n  contact of the heads only, the actual seat in mankind of the sentiment\r\n  of distance-love. The kiss represents a yearning for complete\r\n  fusion-love, and yet is at the same time a symbol of purely spiritual\r\n  distance-love.\r\n\r\n  [9] Especially in France is this the case. Madame Adam describes very\r\n  tastefully this feeling of loss of virtue after granting a kiss.\r\n\r\n  [10] _Cf._ also J. Librowicz, “The Kiss and Kissing,” p. 22 (Hamburg,\r\n  1877).\r\n\r\n  [11] It is interesting to observe that the Chinese regard the European\r\n  kiss as a sign of cannibalism [d’Enjoy, “Le Baiser en Europe et en\r\n  Chine” (“The Kiss in Europe and in China”), _Bulletin de la Société\r\n  d’Anthropologie_, Paris, 1897, No. 2.]\r\n\r\n  [12] We can allude only in passing to the celebrated genito-labial\r\n  nerve of Voltaire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE SECONDARY PHENOMENA OF HUMAN LOVE (REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS, SEXUAL\r\nIMPULSE, SEXUAL ACT)\r\n\r\n\r\n“_Sexual passion is a matter of universal experience; and speaking\r\nbroadly and generally, we may say it is a matter on which it is quite\r\ndesirable that every adult at some time or other should have actual\r\nexperience._”--EDWARD CARPENTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS OF CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n  Origin and purpose of the reproductive organs -- Progressive\r\n  differentiation of these organs -- Original identity of their\r\n  rudiments in the two sexes -- Weininger’s theory of the intermixture\r\n  of the sexual elements -- This theory anticipated by Heinse --\r\n  Bisexuality -- The actual significance of bisexuality trifling --\r\n  Phylogenetic explanation of the organs of sexual congress -- Bölsche’s\r\n  three problems -- The “aperture-problem” -- Connexion between the\r\n  genital aperture and the urinary passage -- Between the genital\r\n  aperture and the anus -- Significance in relation to certain sexual\r\n  aberrations -- The “member-problem” -- Earlier modes of fixation\r\n  during coitus -- Sucking and biting -- The action of the limbs (the\r\n  embrace) -- The penis -- Its various forms -- The penis-bone -- The\r\n  free character of the human penis -- The descent of the testicles --\r\n  The feminine rudiment of the penis -- Its original function rendered\r\n  superfluous by the further evolution of the sexual orifice --\r\n  Transformation into the clitoris and the labia minora -- The\r\n  “libido-problem” -- Voluptuousness a phenomenon of distance-love --\r\n  Questionable specificity of voluptuousness -- Theory of the “sexual\r\n  sense” and of the “sexual cells” -- Relations of voluptuousness to\r\n  tickling and to painful sensations -- A special variety of contact\r\n  stimuli -- Localization to the genital organs -- The sexual impulse --\r\n  Relative independence of the impulse from the reproductive glands --\r\n  Genesis of sexual excitement -- Stage of prelibido (sexual tension) --\r\n  Terminal libido (sexual gratification) -- Symptoms and early\r\n  appearance of prelibido -- Causes of sexual tension -- Freud’s\r\n  chemical theory of sexual tension -- The act of sexual intercourse --\r\n  Roubaud’s description of coitus -- Demeanour of woman in coitus --\r\n  Magendie on this subject -- Dr. Theopold’s observations --\r\n  Physiological phenomena associated with coitus -- Sadistic and\r\n  masochistic elements -- The normal position during sexual intercourse\r\n  -- Figuræ Veneris -- Significance of the normal position in relation\r\n  to civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nAs the progressive evolution of the multicellular organism continued,\r\nand there occurred an increasing differentiation of the individual\r\nportions of the body, it became necessary that the very simple process\r\nof reproduction of the unicellular organism (by simple cell-division or\r\nby conjugation) should, in the multicellular organisms of the metazoa,\r\nbe ensured and facilitated by the development of new apparatus. This was\r\nall the more necessary because, owing to the differentiation of the\r\nother organs, the originally independent reproductive elements became\r\nmore and more dependent upon the parent organism, and lost their former\r\ncapacity for obtaining nourishment by means of their own activity. Hence\r\nit became necessary that the period of time elapsing between the moment\r\nwhen the reproductive cells were freed from the parent organism and the\r\nmoment in which they coalesced to form a new individual should be\r\nshortened to a minimum. This purpose is subserved by apparatus which\r\nrenders possible the =secure= and =rapid= coalescence of the two\r\nreproductive elements, having the form of special =excretory canals=\r\nwith contractile walls, through which the two sexual elements pass.\r\nThese are the “=copulatory organs=,” by means of which the distance\r\nbetween the two loving individuals is abridged. According to the\r\nexhaustive investigations of Ferdinand Simon, the perfection and\r\ndifferentiation of these conducting canals proceeds _pari passu_ with\r\nthe higher development of the organism.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously therewith proceeds the differentiation of the proper\r\ninternal reproductive organs, the rudiments of which are =identical= in\r\nthe two sexes. A portion of these primitively identical structures\r\nundergoes further development in the male, another portion undergoes\r\nfurther development in the female, whilst in both sexes rudiments of the\r\nearlier condition are retained, and these bear witness to the primitive\r\nstate in which =both= reproductive glands were present in a single\r\nindividual (hermaphroditism). In this sense Weininger’s theory\r\napplies--viz., that there is no absolutely male and no absolutely female\r\nindividual, that in every man there is something of woman, and in every\r\nwoman something of man, and that between the two various transitional\r\nforms, sexual “intermediate stages,” exist. Therefore, according to this\r\nview, every individual has in his composition so many fractions “man”\r\nand so many fractions “woman,” and according to the preponderance of\r\none set of elements or the other, he must be assigned to one or the\r\nother sex. This theory, which Weininger regards as his own discovery,\r\n=is by no means new=, and already finds a place in Heinse’s\r\n“Ardinghello,” where we read:\r\n\r\n  “I find it therefore necessary to assume the existence in Nature of\r\n  masculine and feminine elements. =That man is nearest perfection who\r\n  is composed entirely of masculine elements, and that woman perhaps is\r\n  nearest perfection who contains only so many feminine elements as to\r\n  be able to remain woman; whilst that man is the worst who contains\r\n  only so many masculine elements as to qualify for the title of man.=”\r\n\r\nMagnus Hirschfeld, to whom this noteworthy passage in Heinse’s book\r\nappears to be unknown, has recently, in his valuable monographs, “Sexual\r\nStages of Transition” (Leipzig, 1905) and “The Nature of Love” (Leipzig,\r\n1906), thoroughly investigated these relations, and quotes, among\r\nothers, sayings of Darwin and Weismann, according to which the latent\r\npresence of opposite sexual characters in every sexually differentiated\r\nbion must be regarded as a normal arrangement. Unquestionably the widely\r\ndiffused phenomenon of “psychical hermaphroditism,” or “spiritual\r\nbisexuality,” is connected with the physical facts just enumerated, and\r\nprovides us with the key for the understanding of the nature of\r\nhomosexuality. Both these states--the physical and the mental--may be\r\nreferred to primitive conditions of sexuality. They cannot play any\r\nserious part in the future course of human evolution, of which the\r\nprogressive differentiation of the sexes is so marked a characteristic.\r\nIn contrast with this differentiation, these rudimentary sexual\r\nconditions are practically devoid of significance. Suggestion, indeed,\r\nthe influence of momentary tendencies of the time and of transient\r\nmental states, may temporarily deceive us. And when, for example,\r\nHirschfeld maintains that in the central nervous system of women the\r\nmore masculine, rational qualities, and in the central nervous system of\r\nmen the more feminine, emotional qualities, are respectively on the\r\nincrease, we must answer, in the first place, that this is not generally\r\ntrue, and, in the second place, that, in so far as it is true, it is a\r\npassing phenomenon, which has already provoked a powerful reaction in\r\nthe =opposite= direction.[13] The exuviæ of a dead condition cannot\r\nagain be vitalized.\r\n\r\nThe original purpose of the organs of sexual congress is, then, to\r\nsafeguard and to facilitate, in the more complicated conditions peculiar\r\nto multicellular organisms, the conjugation of the two reproductive\r\ncells. They do not exist, as Eduard von Hartmann assumes, as a mere lure\r\nto voluptuousness, to induce man to continue the practice of sexual\r\ncongress, purely instinctive in his animal ancestors, but now endangered\r\nby the development of the higher type of consciousness. For animals\r\nwithout organs of sexual congress also experience a voluptuous sensation\r\nat the instant of the sexual orgasm and of procreation.\r\n\r\nThe history of evolution alone solves the riddle of the origin of the\r\norgans of sexual congress, and renders their purpose clear to us. In a\r\nmost ingenious manner, W. Bölsche distinguishes three problems in this\r\nhistory of the genital organs: the “=aperture-problem=,” the\r\n“=member-problem=,” and the “=libido-problem=.”\r\n\r\nThe first problem relates to the character and the position of the two\r\napertures from which the sexual products, the reproductive cells, issue;\r\nthe second relates to the exact mutual adaptation of the male and the\r\nfemale reproductive apertures; the third relates to the impulse to the\r\nintimate apposition of the genital apertures in consequence of a\r\npowerful nervous stimulus.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable fact that we encounter in our consideration of the\r\nfirst problem--the “aperture-problem”--is the intimate association\r\nbetween the sexual aperture and the excretory canal of the urinary\r\napparatus both in woman and in man--in the latter, indeed, the\r\nassociation is more pronounced. There seems to be a sort of parsimony on\r\nthe part of Nature to combine so closely these two excretory tubes of\r\nthe urine and of the products of sexual activity. Phylogenetically,\r\nindeed, the reproductive products originally passed with the urine\r\nfreely into the open, and it was there that their conjugation took\r\nplace. Among certain worms still existing at the present day we find\r\nthis “urine-love.” Later, the genital canal became separated from the\r\nurinary canal, but the two tubes remained partly united at their\r\noutlets, opening side by side at the same part of the body. In man,\r\nindeed, the urethra still subserves the double purpose of the excretion\r\nof urine and the emission of semen. In woman the two excretory apertures\r\nare distinct, but they open in close proximity into the genital fissure\r\nbetween the thighs.\r\n\r\nThe intimate connexion which thus obtains between the urinary and the\r\nreproductive organs is not without significance for the understanding of\r\ncertain aberrations of the _libido sexualis_. The same is true of the\r\nrelations between the orifice of the genital passage and the similarly\r\nadjacent aperture of the large intestine, the anus. “Anus,” or, better,\r\n“cloaca love,” plays a part, indeed, in many fishes, amphibia, and\r\nreptiles; in these the act of procreation and the excretion of urine and\r\nfæces all take place by way of the cloaca. Among the mammals, at an\r\nearly stage of phylogenetic development the intestine became completely\r\nseparated from the sexual rudiment and the sexual excretory passages;\r\nand it is only in the proximity of the respective orifices that we find\r\nan indication of the primitive association. The act of pæderasty reminds\r\nus of the same fact.\r\n\r\nThe “aperture-problem” itself leads us, in the course of progressive\r\ndevelopment, to the “member-problem”--that is to say, to the problem of\r\nthe more accurate apposition of the two reproductive apertures. The\r\npenis, by its introduction into the body of a member of the opposite\r\nsex, acts as a means for the shortening of distance-love; it serves for\r\nthe fixation, for the clamping together, of the copulating pair, which\r\nin earlier stages of animal life was effected by sucking and biting; for\r\nexample, in birds, who for the most part lack an actual penis, the cock\r\nholds the hen firmly with his beak during intercourse, and the sucking\r\nand biting which often occur in human beings in the sexual act persist\r\nas a reminiscence of these relations. In various vertebrates other means\r\nof fixation are employed: by the shape of fins, of arms, or of legs, a\r\nclose “embrace” is rendered possible; finally, the evolution of a\r\nspecial member for sexual purposes closed the long series of means of\r\nensuring union. Originally no more than a peg or a spine, in man the\r\npenis is first developed into the form of an absolutely free limb. Dogs,\r\nbeasts of prey, rodents, bats, and apes, have a strong bone in the\r\norgan, the so-called “penis-bone.” In man this bone is lacking; the\r\npenis has become entirely free. W. Bölsche writes:\r\n\r\n  “In relation to the large, heavy, massive trunk and thighs, the\r\n  sharply individualized, independent, mobile penis appears as a kind of\r\n  spiritualized central point; as it were, a finger or a small third\r\n  hand to the trunk, appearing to the eye to stand in rhythmical\r\n  relation with the hands, right and left.”\r\n\r\nIn phylogenetic parallelism with the development of the penis, proceeds\r\n(from the marsupials upwards) the _descensus testiculorum_, the descent\r\nof the male reproductive glands, the testicles, until they attain their\r\nfinal position in the scrotum, beneath the penis. Here also we can\r\nrecognize the principle of “limb-mobility,” mentally refined mobility.\r\n\r\nIn the clitoris woman also possesses a rudiment of a primitive penis.\r\nBy the apposition of the two limbs, a more complete and rapid\r\nconjunction of the reciprocal sexual products must have been effected.\r\nBut the further development of the large sexual aperture of the female\r\nchecked the progressive development of this primitive penis, made it to\r\nsome extent superfluous, since now, by the adaptation of the male penis\r\nto the female sexual aperture, a sufficient internal fixation in the act\r\nof copulation was rendered possible. Thus the female penis came to\r\nsubserve other purposes: a portion of it formed the labia minora;\r\nanother portion, the upper, the clitoris, the name of which sufficiently\r\nindicates the fact that, like the penis of the male, its function is\r\nconnected with the voluptuous sense.\r\n\r\nThis leads us to the third and last problem, the “libido-problem.” In\r\nthe human species voluptuous pleasure is almost completely divorced from\r\nthe process of “fusion-love,” the coalescence of spermatozoon and ovum,\r\nand has for the most part become a phenomenon of “distance-love.” It\r\nappears extremely doubtful if there is anything specific about the\r\nvoluptuous sensation--whether there is, in fact, a special “sexual\r\nsense.” Magnus Hirschfeld assumes the existence of peculiar “sexual\r\ncells,” of receptive areas for sexual stimuli, furnished with a sensory\r\nsubstance endowed with a peculiar specific sensibility. He regards love\r\nand the sexual impulse as “a molecular movement or force of a quite\r\nspecific quality, streaming through the nervous system,” and accompanied\r\nby a quite peculiar sensation, or pleasure-tone, arising from a\r\ncondition of excitement of the sexual cells. But, as we have already\r\npointed out, the voluptuous sensation is merely a special case of\r\ngeneral cutaneous sensibility; it is very closely allied with the\r\ncutaneous sensation of tickling; properly speaking, it is no more than\r\nan =excessively powerful tickling=.[14] It has also intimate relations\r\nwith the sensation of pain.[15] The structure and position of the\r\nnerve-terminal apparatus of the genital organs, by means of which\r\nvoluptuous pleasure is rendered possible, exhibit great similarity with\r\nthe touch corpuscles and sensory end-organs of other parts of the skin.\r\nIn the sexual orgasm the general cutaneous sensation increases to so\r\nhigh a degree of intensity, becomes so powerful, that for an instant\r\n=consciousness= is actually lost. The association of a momentary loss of\r\nconsciousness with the acme of sensation indicates the summit of sexual\r\npleasure--it is an abandonment, a dissolution, of individual\r\npersonality.\r\n\r\nVoluptuous pleasure plays its part in the human species entirely in the\r\nsphere of distance-love. Bölsche has very beautifully described its\r\nsignificance in this relation:\r\n\r\n  “All-embracing in its path towards the attainment of its final aim is\r\n  the love-life also of the great cell societies, such as you yourself\r\n  are, such as I myself am, such as your beloved is. These higher, more\r\n  advanced individuals saw one another, approached one another, heard\r\n  one another, perceived one another through a hundred external media;\r\n  they became spiritually fused, and attained a condition of wonderful\r\n  harmony--their principal body walls came at length into immediate\r\n  contact--they pressed one another’s hands, they embraced one another,\r\n  kissed one another--they drew ever closer and closer together; to a\r\n  certain extent the body of one penetrated the body of the other. In\r\n  all this, =their= love undertook the =whole= affair, undertook it a\r\n  thousand times more effectually than the individual cells seeking\r\n  conjunction could ever have done; undertook it for the sake of the\r\n  reproductive cells hidden deep within their bodies. All the\r\n  pleasurable and painful feelings of love undulated and surged for so\r\n  long a time throughout the entire organism with intense force; these\r\n  feelings agitated the entire superior, comprehensive, individual\r\n  personality, searched its every depth with stormy emotions of desire,\r\n  complaint, and exultation.\r\n\r\n  “But at a precise instant this all came to a halt. The seminal cells\r\n  were ejaculated; one of them conjugated with the ovum; the hidden\r\n  inward life of a tiny separate organism began within the body of one\r\n  of the over-individuals. The last separation was bridged, and the true\r\n  cell-fusion took place. But when this happened, the immediate\r\n  relationship with the love-life of the great individual man and woman\r\n  was already completely severed. The bodily act of love was already\r\n  long at an end; its increase to a climax and its fulfilment had long\r\n  passed by.\r\n\r\n  “The instant of supreme voluptuous pleasure, which in the case of\r\n  unicellular beings naturally occurs at the moment of complete\r\n  coalescence, must in the case of the multicellular organisms just as\r\n  naturally be =transferred= to another stage, as it were, in the great\r\n  path of love.\r\n\r\n  “To an earlier stage.\r\n\r\n  “To that stage of distance-love which is =nearest= to the true act of\r\n  fusion of the reproductive elements. To the farthest point, that is to\r\n  say, attained by the great containers of the genuine unicellular\r\n  sexual elements (themselves capable of the act of ultimate\r\n  coalescence)--the farthest point =attained= by the multicellular\r\n  over-individuals.”\r\n\r\nThis farthest point is an =act of contact=.[16] We have already learnt\r\nto regard the skin as a projection of the nervous system, and we have\r\ncome to understand the significance of the skin in the sphere of\r\nsexuality. The other senses which have arisen from the skin must also be\r\ntaken into account in this matter. In the genital organs, this touch\r\nstimulus assumes a quite peculiar character; it gives rise here to the\r\nproper voluptuous sensation which is associated with the discharge of\r\nthe reproductive products. In man this association is most distinctly\r\nmanifest. The instant of most intense sexual pleasure coincides with\r\nejaculation, with the expulsion of the semen. The character of this\r\nvoluptuous sensation can hardly be defined; in part, it is like an\r\nintense tickling sensation, but, on the other hand, it has an\r\nunmistakable relationship to pain. Later, in another connexion, we shall\r\nconsider this interesting point at greater length. Not inaptly the\r\nsexual act has also been compared with sneezing; the preliminary\r\ntickling sensation, with the subsequent discharge of nervous tension, in\r\nthe form of a sneeze, have, in fact, a notable similarity with the\r\nprocesses occurring in the sexual act.\r\n\r\nThe sexual act depends upon the occurrence of certain stimuli which are\r\nconnected with the complete development of the internal and external\r\ngenital organs and of the reproductive glands. The time when this\r\ndevelopment occurs in man and woman is known as =puberty=. The sum of\r\nthese stimuli is known as the “=sexual impulse=.” Whereas in the lower\r\nanimals the sexual impulse is for the most part connected with the\r\nactivity of the reproductive glands, in the human species, in\r\nassociation with the preponderating significance of the brain, it has\r\nattained a relative independence of the reproductive glands; whilst the\r\nmind has come to influence the sexual impulse very powerfully. Generally\r\nspeaking, sexual excitement is produced in three ways: first, by the\r\nactivity of the reproductive glands; secondly, by peripheral excitement\r\nderived from the so-called “erogenic” areas; and thirdly, by central\r\npsychical influences. S. Freud has recently studied the relations\r\nbetween these three causes of sexual excitement, of the sexual impulse,\r\nand has very properly distinguished two stages--the stage of\r\n“=prelibido=” (sexual desire), and the stage of the proper sexual\r\n“=libido=” (sexual gratification).\r\n\r\nThe stage of prelibido has distinctly the character of tension; the\r\nstage of libido, the character of relief. The feeling of tension during\r\nthe prelibido finds expression mentally as well as physically by a\r\nseries of changes in the genital organs. The tension is further\r\nincreased by the stimulation of the various erogenic zones. If this\r\nprelibido increases beyond a certain degree, the characteristic\r\npotential energy of sexual tension is transformed into the relief-giving\r\nkinetic energy of the terminal libido, during which the evacuation of\r\nthe reproductive products occurs.\r\n\r\nPrelibido, which is especially characterized by engorgement, swelling,\r\nand erection of the corpora cavernosa of the male and female\r\nreproductive organs, occurring as a reflex from the spinal cord, may be\r\nexperienced long before puberty; it is much more independent of\r\nprocesses occurring in the reproductive glands than is the terminal\r\nlibido, or sexual gratification, which in the male accompanies\r\nejaculation of the semen, and is associated with conditions attained\r\nonly at puberty.\r\n\r\nThe actual origin of the sexual tension which ultimately leads to\r\nejaculation is still obscure; it seems, at first sight, probable that in\r\nthe male this sensation is connected with the accumulation of semen in\r\nthe seminal vesicles. Pressure on the walls of these structures may be\r\nsupposed to stimulate the sexual centres in the spinal cord, and also\r\nthose in the brain; but this theory fails to take into account the\r\ncondition in the child, in woman, and in castrated males, in all of\r\nwhom, notwithstanding the absence of the accumulation of any\r\nreproductive products, nevertheless a distinct state of sexual tension\r\nmay be observed. It is, indeed, an old experience that eunuchs may have\r\na very powerful sexual impulse. It is obvious, then, that the sexual\r\nimpulse must be, to a very great extent, independent of the reproductive\r\nglands.\r\n\r\nThe nature of sexual tension is still entirely unknown. Freud assumes,\r\nin view of the recently recognized significance of the thyroid glands in\r\nrelation to sexuality, that possibly some substance generally diffused\r\nthroughout the organism is produced by stimulation of the erogenic\r\nzones, that the products of decomposition of this substance exercise a\r\nspecific stimulus on the reproductive organs, or on the associated\r\nsexual centre in the spinal cord. For example, such a transformation of\r\na toxic, chemical stimulus into a special organ-stimulus is known to\r\noccur in the case of certain foreign poisonous materials introduced into\r\nthe body. Freud considers that the probability of this chemical theory\r\nof sexual excitement is increased by the fact that the neuroses\r\nreferable to disturbances of the sexual life possess a great clinical\r\nsimilarity to the phenomena of intoxication induced by the habitual\r\nemployment of aphrodisiac poisons (certain alkaloids).\r\n\r\nThe relief of sexual tension occurs in the natural way in the =sexual\r\nact=, in the completion of normal intercourse between man and woman.\r\nNotwithstanding the numerous observations of leading natural\r\nphilosophers and physicians concerning the act of sexual congress, among\r\nwhich I need only refer to those of Magendie, Johannes Müller, Marshall\r\nHall, Kobelt, Busch, Deslandes, Roubaud, Landois, Theopold, Burdach, and\r\nmany others, we possess, for reasons it is easy to understand, no really\r\nexact investigations regarding the different phenomena occurring during\r\nthe sexual act. More particularly, the demeanour of the woman during\r\nthis act is a matter which remains extremely obscure.\r\n\r\nThe French physician Roubaud has given us the most vivid description of\r\nsexual intercourse:\r\n\r\n  “As soon as the penis enters the vaginal vestibule, it first of all\r\n  pushes against the glans clitoridis, which is situated at the entrance\r\n  of the genital canal, and owing to its length and to the way in which\r\n  it is bent, can give way and bend further before the penis. After this\r\n  preliminary stimulation of the two chief centres of sexual\r\n  sensibility, the glans penis glides over the inner surfaces of the two\r\n  vaginal bulbs; the collum and the body of the penis are then grasped\r\n  between the projecting surfaces of the vaginal bulbs, but the glans\r\n  penis itself, which has passed further onward, is in contact with the\r\n  fine and delicate surface of the vaginal mucous membrane, which\r\n  membrane itself, owing to the presence of erectile tissue between the\r\n  layers, is now in an elastic, resilient condition. This elasticity,\r\n  which enables the vagina to adapt itself to the size of the penis,\r\n  increases at once the turgescence and the sensibility of the clitoris,\r\n  inasmuch as the blood that is driven out of the vessels of the vaginal\r\n  wall passes thence to those of the vaginal bulbs and the clitoris. On\r\n  the other hand, the turgescence and the sensitiveness of the glans\r\n  penis itself are heightened by compression of that organ, in\r\n  consequence of the ever-increasing fulness of the vessels of the\r\n  vaginal mucous membrane and the two vaginal bulbs.\r\n\r\n  “At the same time, the clitoris is pressed downwards by the anterior\r\n  portion of the compressor muscle, so that it is brought into contact\r\n  with the dorsal surface of the glans and of the body of the penis. In\r\n  this way a reciprocal friction between these two organs takes place,\r\n  repeated at each copulatory movement made by the two parties to the\r\n  act, until at length the voluptuous sensation rises to its highest\r\n  intensity, and culminates in the sexual orgasm, marked in the male by\r\n  the ejaculation of the seminal fluid, and in the female by the\r\n  aspiration of that fluid into the gaping external orifice of the\r\n  cervical canal.\r\n\r\n  “When we take into consideration the influence which temperament,\r\n  constitution, and a number of other special and general circumstances\r\n  are capable of exercising on the intensity of sexual sensation, it may\r\n  well be doubted if the problem regarding the differences in voluptuous\r\n  sensation between the male and the female is anywhere near solution;\r\n  indeed, we may go further, and feel convinced that this problem, in\r\n  view of all the difficulties that surround it, is really insoluble. So\r\n  true is this, that it is a difficult matter to give a picture at once\r\n  accurate and complete of the phenomena attending the normal act of\r\n  copulation. Whilst in one individual the sense of sexual pleasure\r\n  amounts to no more than a barely perceptible titillation, in another\r\n  that sense reaches the acme of both mental and physical exaltation.\r\n\r\n  “Between these two extremes we meet with innumerable states of\r\n  transition. In cases of intense exaltation various pathological\r\n  symptoms make themselves manifest, such as quickening of the general\r\n  circulation and violent pulsation of the arteries; the venous blood,\r\n  being retained in the larger vessels by general muscular contractions,\r\n  leads to an increased warmth of the body; and, further, this venous\r\n  stagnation, which is still more marked in the brain in consequence of\r\n  the contraction of the cervical muscles and the backward flexion of\r\n  the neck, may cause cerebral congestion, during which consciousness\r\n  and all mental manifestations are momentarily in abeyance. The eyes,\r\n  reddened by injection of the conjunctiva, become fixed, and the\r\n  expression becomes vacant; the lids close convulsively, to exclude the\r\n  light. In some the breathing becomes panting and labouring; but in\r\n  others it is temporarily suspended, in consequence of laryngeal spasm,\r\n  and the air, after being pent up for a time in the lungs, is finally\r\n  forcibly expelled, accompanied by the utterance of incoherent and\r\n  incomprehensible words.\r\n\r\n  “The impulses proceeding from the congested nerve centres are\r\n  confused. There is an indescribable disorder both of motion and of\r\n  sensation; the extremities are affected with convulsive twitchings,\r\n  and may be either moved in various directions or extended straight and\r\n  stiff; the jaws are pressed together so that the teeth grind against\r\n  each other; and certain individuals are affected by erotic delirium to\r\n  such an extent that they will seize the unguarded shoulder, for\r\n  instance, of their partner in the sexual act, and bite it till the\r\n  blood flows.\r\n\r\n  “This delirious frenzy is usually of short duration, but sufficiently\r\n  long to exhaust the forces of the organism, especially in the male, in\r\n  whom the condition of hyperexcitability is terminated by a more or\r\n  less abundant loss of semen.\r\n\r\n  “A period of exhaustion follows, which is the more intense in\r\n  proportion to the intensity of the preceding excitement. The sudden\r\n  fatigue, the general sense of weakness, and the inclination to sleep,\r\n  which habitually affect the male after the act of intercourse, are in\r\n  part to be ascribed to the loss of semen; for in the female, however\r\n  energetic the part she may have played in the sexual act, a mere\r\n  transient fatigue is observed, much less in degree than that which\r\n  affects the male, and permitting far sooner of a repetition of the\r\n  act. ‘_Triste est omne animal post coitum, præter mulierem\r\n  gallumque_,’ wrote Galen, and the axiom is essentially true--at any\r\n  rate, so far as the human species is concerned.”\r\n\r\nKobelt, in his celebrated work on the human organs of sexual pleasure\r\n(Freiburg, 1884, p. 55 _et seq._), gave a similar description of\r\ncopulation. In the majority of descriptions of coitus but little\r\nattention is usually paid to the demeanour of the woman. Magendie long\r\nago drew attention to the fact that there was much obscurity about this\r\nmatter, and insisted that, in comparison with the male, the female\r\nexhibited extremely marked differences, in respect to her active\r\nparticipation in copulation and to the intensity of her voluptuous\r\nsensations.\r\n\r\n  “Very many women,” says this distinguished physiologist, “experience a\r\n  sexual orgasm accompanied by very intense voluptuous sensations;\r\n  others, on the contrary, appear entirely devoid of sensation; and\r\n  some, again, have only a disagreeable and painful sensation. Many\r\n  women excrete, at this moment of most intense sexual pleasure, a large\r\n  quantity of mucus, but the majority do not exhibit this phenomenon. In\r\n  reference to all these phenomena, =there are perhaps no two women who\r\n  are precisely similar=.”\r\n\r\nThe demeanour of the woman _in coitu_ has been especially studied by\r\ngynæcologists, such as Busch, Theopold, and recently Otto Adler. Little\r\nknown are the observations of Dr. Theopold, based upon his own\r\nexperience, and published in 1873. He energetically denies the view that\r\nthe woman is always passive in coitus, and also that the female\r\nreproductive organs are inactive during intercourse. During erotic\r\nexcitement in woman the heart beats more frequently, the arteries of the\r\nlabia pulsate powerfully, the genital organs are turgid and are hotter\r\nto the touch. As the most intense libido approaches, the uterus\r\nundergoes erection; its base touches the anterior abdominal wall; the\r\nFallopian tubes can be distinctly felt through the abdominal wall, when\r\nthese are thin, as hard, curved strings. The vagina, especially the\r\nupper part of the passage, undergoes rhythmical contraction and\r\ndilation, and complete gratification terminates the act.\r\n\r\nAs long as the muscle guarding the vaginal outlet (constrictor\r\ncunni--bulbo-cavernosus muscle) is intact, the woman is able, by tightly\r\ngrasping the root of the penis, to expedite the ejaculation of semen, or\r\nto increase the stimulation of the male until ejaculation occurs.\r\n\r\nThese powerful contractions of the vagina, alternating rhythmically with\r\nthe dilatations occurring during the orgasm, grip the glans penis\r\ntightly, and induce a coaptation of the male urethral orifice with the\r\nos uteri externum, and the enlargement of the latter orifice facilitates\r\nthe entrance of the semen. According to O. Adler, sexual excitement of\r\nthe woman during sexual intercourse begins with very powerful congestion\r\nof the entire reproductive apparatus, including even the fimbriæ\r\nsurrounding the abdominal orifice of the Fallopian tubes; this\r\ncongestion gives rise to an erection of these parts, and especially of\r\nthe clitoris, the labia minora, and the vaginal wall. At the same time,\r\nthe glands of the vaginal mucous membrane and of the vaginal inlet begin\r\nto secrete, as is manifest by the moistness of the external genital\r\norgans. There now begin gentle rhythmical contractions of the vagina and\r\nof the pelvic muscles, and during the orgasm these increase, to become\r\nspasmodic contractions, whereby an increased secretion is extruded, and\r\nmore especially is there an evacuation of uterine mucus.\r\n\r\nIt is very important to note the various physiological accompaniments of\r\ncoitus, since they assist us to understand the mode of origin and the\r\nbiological root of many sexual perversions. Already in normal sexual\r\nintercourse sadistic and masochistic phenomena may be observed. The\r\nbiting and crying out mentioned by Roubaud as occurring in the\r\nvoluptuous ecstasy are, indeed, of very frequent occurrence. Rudolf\r\nBergh, the celebrated Danish dermatologist and physician, of the\r\nCopenhagen Hospital for Women suffering from Venereal Diseases, alludes\r\nregularly in his annual reports to the consequences of “erotic bites.”\r\nAmongst the Southern Slavs, the custom of “biting one another” is very\r\ngeneral (Krauss). The intense dark red coloration of the face and of the\r\nreproductive organs and their environment is also a physiological\r\naccompaniment of sexual excitement, and this coloration is more marked\r\nin consequence of the associated turgescence of the male and female\r\ngenital organs; it leads, moreover, to associations of feeling in which\r\nthe =blood= plays a dominant part. Hence we deduce the biological and\r\nethnological significance of the colour red in the sphere of sexuality.\r\nThe nature of the sadist “to see red” during sexual intercourse is,\r\ntherefore, firmly founded upon a physiological basis, and merely\r\nexhibits an increase of a normal phenomenon.[17] The crying and cursing\r\nin which many individuals find sexual gratification has also a\r\nphysiological representative in the inarticulate noises and cries\r\nfrequently expressed in normal intercourse. It is remarkable that an\r\nIndian writer on erotics--Vātsyāyana--deduces this verbal sadism from\r\nthe various noises which are commonly made in normal intercourse.\r\nSimilarly, in both parties to the sexual act the presence of masochistic\r\nelements can be detected: witness the patience with which pain is borne\r\nwhen it has a voluptuous tinge.[18]\r\n\r\nPassing to the consideration of the =posture= adopted during\r\nintercourse, we find in civilized man, who in this respect is far\r\nremoved from animals, the normal position during coitus is front to\r\nfront, the woman lying on her back with her lower extremities widely\r\nseparated, and the knee and hip joints semiflexed; the man lies on her,\r\nwith his thighs between hers, supporting himself on hands or elbows--or\r\noften the two unite their lips in a kiss.\r\n\r\nOf all other numerous positions during coitus, or _figuræ Veneris_, some\r\nof which, according to Sheikh Nefzawi, are possible only “in words and\r\nthoughts,” the postures that demand consideration on hygienic grounds\r\nare, lateral decubitus of the woman, dorsal decubitus of the man, and\r\ncoitus _a posteriori_ (for example, when man and woman are extremely\r\nobese); but this subject belongs rather to the chapter on sexual\r\nhygiene.\r\n\r\nPloss-Bartels has proved that the position described above as normal was\r\nusual already in ancient times and amongst the most diverse peoples. The\r\nadoption of this position in coitus undoubtedly ensued in the human race\r\nupon the evolution of the upright posture. It is the natural,\r\ninstinctive position of civilized man, who in this respect also\r\nmanifests an advance on the lower animals.\r\n\r\n  [13] Apart from Strindberg and Weininger, who advocate, for the\r\n  salvation of the future and as ideals of development, the most\r\n  pronounced and one-sided development of the masculine type, I need\r\n  refer only to “The Physiological Weakmindedness of Woman” by Möbius,\r\n  and to such writings as B. Friedländer’s “Renaissance des Eros\r\n  Uranios” (Berlin, 1904), and to Eduard von Mayer’s “The Vital Laws of\r\n  Civilization” (Halle, 1904), as characteristic symptoms of such a\r\n  reaction.\r\n\r\n  [14] ITCHING, TICKLING, AND SEXUAL SENSIBILITY.--On September 2, 1890,\r\n  Dr. Bronson, Professor of Dermatology in the New York Polyclinic, read\r\n  before the American Dermatological Association a paper on “The\r\n  Sensation of Itching” (printed in the _New York Medical Record_ of\r\n  October 18, 1890, and republished by the New Sydenham Society in 1893\r\n  in a volume entitled “Selected Monographs on Dermatology”). In this\r\n  paper the author deals at some length with the relations between\r\n  itching and the voluptuous, or, as he calls it, the “aphrodisiac,”\r\n  sense. He also denies the specific character of sexual sensations, and\r\n  states that the aphrodisiac sense “is but a higher development of the\r\n  primitive sense of contact. It has a special organ or instrument--the\r\n  penis in the male, the clitoris in the female. Moreover, it is\r\n  distributed over the entire cutaneous surface” (New Sydenham Society,\r\n  _op. cit._, p. 314). In this connexion, and more particularly apropos\r\n  of Dr. Bloch’s statement on the previous page that “the function of\r\n  the clitoris is expressed by its name” (German, _Kitzler_), it is\r\n  interesting to note that in German the word _Kitzel_ variously\r\n  denotes--(1) _tickling_, (2) _itching_, (3) _sexual desire_, (4)\r\n  _sexual gratification_. The more commonly employed German term for\r\n  itching, _Jucken_, does not possess any secondary sexual\r\n  signification; but, as Dr. Bronson points out (_op. cit._, p. 312),\r\n  “both the English words _itch_ and _itching_, and the Latin _prurio_\r\n  and _pruritus_, in their secondary significations, convey the idea of\r\n  a longing, teasing desire, while _pruritus_ was commonly used by the\r\n  Latins as a synonym for lasciviousness.” The same idea is, of course,\r\n  conveyed by the English derivations, _pruriency_ and _prurient_. Thus,\r\n  we see that the familiar terminology of these three tongues (and\r\n  doubtless of many others) refuses to countenance Hirschfeld’s view\r\n  regarding the specific character of sexual sensibility.--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n  [15] In his profound essay, containing a number of new points of view,\r\n  “Concerning the Emotions” (_Monatsschrift für Psychiatrie und\r\n  Neurologie_, 1906, vol. xix., Heft 3 and 4), Dr. Edmund Forster has\r\n  ably discussed these primitive relations between voluptuous sensation\r\n  and pain. According to him, the sexual tension, which commences at the\r\n  time of puberty, is an increased stimulus of the sensory nerves of the\r\n  genital organs. The positive sensation-tone of libido accompanying\r\n  ejaculation represents the relief of the painful, disturbing sensation\r\n  of sexual tension, and for this reason it has a pleasurable tone.\r\n\r\n  [16] Carpenter perceives in this “sense of contact” the essence of all\r\n  sexual love.\r\n\r\n  [17] For this reason many ingenious prostitutes wear a red\r\n  chemise.--_Cf._ P. Näcke, “Un Cas de Fetichisme de Souliers,” etc. (“A\r\n  Case of Shoe Fetichism”), in _Bulletin de la Société de Médecine\r\n  Mentale de Belgique_, 1894.\r\n\r\n  [18] Thus it appears that sadism and masochism are not manifestations\r\n  of “genital atavism” in the sense of Mantegazza and Lombroso, but are\r\n  rather due to the gradual and pathological increase of physiological\r\n  phenomena still manifest at the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL DIFFERENTIAL SEXUAL CHARACTERS\r\n\r\n\r\n“_We have here a_ primitive _inequality, whose primitiveness goes back\r\nto the opposition between content and form.

The\r\nexistence of this difference can be proved, alike in physical and\r\npsychical relations, already in the fundamental phenomenon of human\r\nlove, in which, because here the relations are simple and uncomplicated,\r\nit is most easily visible.\r\n\r\nWaldeyer, in his notable address on the somatic differences between the\r\nsexes, delivered in 1895 at the Anthropological Congress in Kassel, drew\r\nattention to the fact that the higher development of any particular\r\nspecies is notably characterized by the increasing differentiation of\r\nthe sexes. The further we advance in the animal and vegetable world from\r\nthe lower to the higher forms, the more markedly are the male and the\r\nfemale individuals distinguished one from another. In the human species\r\nalso, in the course of phylogenetic development, this sexual\r\ndifferentiation increases in extent.\r\n\r\nIn the development of these sexual differences, the antagonism first\r\nshown by Herbert Spencer to exist between reproduction and the higher\r\nevolutionary tendency plays an important part. Among the higher species\r\nof animals the males exhibit a stronger evolutionary tendency than the\r\nfemales, owing to the fact that their share in the work of reproduction\r\nhas become less important. The more extensive organic expenditure\r\ndemanded by the reproductive functions limits the feminine development\r\nto a notably greater extent than the masculine. In the human species\r\nthis retardation of growth in the female is especially increased in\r\nconsequence of menstruation, and this affords a striking example of the\r\ntruth of Spencer’s law. I quote also in this connexion the remarks of\r\nthe Würzburg anatomist Oskar Schultze, in his recently published\r\nvaluable monograph on “Woman from an Anthropological Point of View,” pp.\r\n55, 56 (Würzburg, 1906);\r\n\r\n  “The undulatory periodicity of the principal functions of the feminine\r\n  organism, which depends on the processes of ovulation and\r\n  menstruation, and is invariable in the females of the human species,\r\n  does not occur in the other mammalia (with the exception of apes). In\r\n  these latter, as far as we have been able to observe, the secondary\r\n  sexual characters, in the matter of differences in muscular\r\n  development and in strength, are not so developed, or sometimes are\r\n  not so developed, as in the human species. We must in this connexion\r\n  exclude the differences which appear in domestic animals as a result\r\n  of domestication (for example, the difference between the cow and the\r\n  bull). In the human female, the periodicity, which begins to act even\r\n  on the youthful, still undeveloped body, has during thousands of years\r\n  increased the secondary sexual differences. Periodicity is, in my\r\n  opinion, an important cause of the fact that woman is inferior to man,\r\n  more especially in the development of the muscular system and in\r\n  strength, and that her organs, for the most part, are more closely\r\n  approximated to the infantile type.\r\n\r\n  “The sexually mature body of a woman has always during the\r\n  intermenstrual period to make good the loss undergone during\r\n  menstruation. Hardly has this been effected and the climax of vital\r\n  energy been once more attained, when a new follicle ruptures in the\r\n  ovary, and the menstrual hæmorrhage recurs; thus continually, month\r\n  after month, the vital undulation and the vital energy rises and\r\n  falls. =The energy periodically expended in woman’s principal function\r\n  has for thousands of years ceased to be available for her own internal\r\n  development.= The actual loss on each occasion is so trifling that\r\n  numerous women hardly find it disagreeable. The effect depends upon\r\n  summation. The earnings are almost immediately spent, =not for the\r\n  purpose of her own domestic economy, but for the sake of another, in\r\n  the service of reproduction=; this comes first, for the species must\r\n  be preserved. =To accumulate capital for her personal needs has been\r\n  rendered more difficult for woman than it is for man.=”\r\n\r\nThe previously quoted biological law of Spencer (regarding the\r\nantagonism between reproduction and the higher evolutionary tendency),\r\nof which menstruation affords so interesting an illustration, explains\r\nalso the fact pointed out by Milne Edwards, Darwin, Brooks, Lombroso,\r\nAlfons Bilharz, and other investigators--to wit, the greater simplicity\r\nand primitiveness of woman as compared with the more complicated and\r\nmore variable nature of man--more variable, because it oscillates within\r\nwider boundaries. Paracelsus long ago enunciated the profound saying,\r\n“=Woman is nearer to the world than man.=”\r\n\r\nIt would be =fundamentally erroneous= to deduce from these\r\nconsiderations any inferiority or comparative inutility of woman.\r\nRather, indeed, the nature of her bodily structure in relation to the\r\npurposes it has to fulfil is comparatively nearer perfection; and this\r\nadmirable adaptation has undergone an increase in the course of the\r\nevolution of civilization. We have already noted the fact that under the\r\ninfluence of the continually increasing predominance of the brain in the\r\nmale, certain retrogressive processes have also made themselves manifest\r\n(as, for example, the increasing loss of hair); and these processes in\r\nwoman have gone farther than in man, because in her case the progressive\r\ndevelopment is =in its very nature= less extensive. Hence recent\r\ninvestigators, such as Havelock Ellis, have actually come to the\r\nconclusion that the ideal type, towards which the bodily development of\r\nmankind is striving, is represented by the feminine--that is, by a\r\nyouthful type.[19]\r\n\r\nIt is, however, very doubtful if this evolution will ever go so far that\r\nthe =primitive= difference between man and woman, founded as it is in\r\nthe very nature of the sexual, will ever pass away. On the contrary,\r\nnotwithstanding the retrogressive changes associated with the excessive\r\ndevelopment of the brain, we find that there is =an increasing\r\ndifferentiation of the sexes induced by civilization=. To this fact,\r\nwhich possesses great importance in connexion with the discussion of the\r\nwoman’s question and the problem of homosexuality, W. H. Riehl, the\r\nhistorian of civilization, in his work on the family, published in 1885,\r\nwas the first to draw attention. He devotes the second chapter of this\r\nbook to the differentiation of the sexes in the course of civilized\r\nlife. He was astonished by the fact that in almost all the portraits of\r\ncelebrated beauties of previous centuries the heads appeared to him too\r\n=masculine= in type when compared with the ideal of feminine beauty\r\nwhich now appeals to us.\r\n\r\n  “The medieval painters, when representing the general type of angels\r\n  and saints, van Eyck and Memmling in their Madonnas and female saints,\r\n  paint heads exhibiting the most clearly defined individual\r\n  characteristics, but into these feeling representations of delicate\r\n  virginity there intrude certain harsh lineaments, so that the heads\r\n  strike us as masculine, or as a little too old. Van Eyck’s Madonnas,\r\n  with the Christ-child at their breast, frequently look to us like\r\n  women of thirty years old. But the painter must have followed Nature;\r\n  =it is Nature which since his time has changed. The tender virgin of\r\n  three hundred years ago had more masculine lineaments than she has at\r\n  the present day=, and he who in the portrait of a Maria Stuart expects\r\n  to find a face like one he would meet in a modern journal of fashion\r\n  will find himself greatly disappointed by certain traits in the\r\n  pictures of this celebrated beauty, traits which to the nineteenth\r\n  century would seem almost masculine.”\r\n\r\nThe contrast between the sexes becomes with advancing civilization\r\ncontinually sharper and more individualized, whereas in primitive\r\nconditions, and even at the present day among agricultural labourers and\r\nthe proletariat, it is less sharp and to some extent even obliterated.\r\nLet the reader familiarize himself with the likenesses of modern women\r\nof the working classes; they seem to us almost to resemble disguised\r\nmen. In the stature, also, of the sexes among savage peoples, and among\r\nthe lower classes of the civilized nations, the sexual differences are\r\nmuch less marked than in our cultivated large towns. Very characteristic\r\nof the differentiating influence of civilization is, moreover, the\r\neffect on the voice. Riehl remarks on this subject:\r\n\r\n  “The tone of the voice even, in simpler conditions of civilization, is\r\n  generally far more alike in the two sexes. The high tenor, the\r\n  feminine man’s voice, and the deep alto, the masculine woman’s voice,\r\n  are among civilized peoples far rarer than among savage races, in whom\r\n  masculine and feminine varieties sometimes seem hardly\r\n  distinguishable. Our bandmasters travel to Hungary and Galicia to find\r\n  clear high tenors, whilst deep alto voices are now increasingly\r\n  difficult to find, for the reason that among the civilized peoples the\r\n  masculine-feminine contraltos die out. =Dominant, on the other side,\r\n  is the distinct contrast between the two sexual tones of\r\n  voices--soprano and bass.= This fact has already had a determining\r\n  influence in our school of song; it affects our vocal\r\n  tone-teaching--to such a hidden, out-of-the-way path have we been led\r\n  by our recognition of the continually increasing contrast between man\r\n  and woman.”\r\n\r\nCertain phenomena and aberrations of the movement for the emancipation\r\nof women, such as the adoption of a masculine style of dress and the use\r\nof tobacco, are no more than =relapses= into a primitive condition,\r\nwhich among the common people has persisted unaltered to the present\r\nday. We need merely allude to the man’s hat, the short coat, and the\r\nhigh-laced boot of the Tyrolese women, and to the tobacco-smoking of the\r\nwomen at the wedding festivals among the German peasantry. A false\r\n“emancipation” of this kind is frequently encountered among peasants,\r\nvagabonds, and gipsies, to which, moreover, the neuter designation of\r\nthe women of this class as _das Mensch_ and “woman-fellow,” etc., bears\r\nwitness; we have herein characteristic indications of the fact that\r\n“peculiar to the woman of the people is a self-conscious, actively\r\nprogressive masculine nature.”\r\n\r\nThat the comparative obliteration of sexual contrasts among the lower\r\norders of modern society is a vestigial relic of primitive conditions,\r\nis shown also by the primeval history of the nations. The idea appearing\r\nalready in the Biblical creation myth, and the thought later expressed\r\nby Plato, and recently by Jacob Böhme, that the first human being was\r\noriginally both man and woman, and that the woman was subsequently\r\nformed out of this primeval human being Adam--this pregnant thought\r\nmerely expresses the fact of the indifference of the sexes among savage\r\npeople and in the primitive history of mankind. The hermaphrodite of\r\nancient art is, like the man-woman of the modern woman’s movement, an\r\natavism, a retrogression to these long-past stages, of which we have\r\nonly the above-mentioned vestiges to remind us.[20]\r\n\r\nFriedrich Ratzel, in the introduction to his great work on “The Races of\r\nMan,” also alludes to this primitive obscuration of sexual contrasts in\r\nearlier stages of civilization, and draws therefrom interesting\r\nconclusions regarding the existence of a primordial gynecocracy, a\r\n“regiment of women.” I have myself discussed this question in the second\r\nvolume of my book, “Contributions to the Etiology of Psychopathia\r\nSexualis,” and shall return to the subject when dealing with masochism.\r\n\r\nW. H. Riehl, and after him Heinrich Schurtz, have laid stress on the\r\ndangers to civilization involved in the obliteration of sexual\r\ndifferences. Sexual differentiation stands and falls with civilization.\r\nThe former is the indispensable preliminary of the latter. Destroy it,\r\nand the whole course of development will be reversed.\r\n\r\nSexual differences comprise for the most part the diverse development of\r\nthe so-called “secondary sexual characters”--that is to say, all the\r\ndifferential characteristics which distinguish man from woman, over and\r\nabove those strictly related to the work of sex--for instance, stature,\r\nskeleton, muscles, skin, voice, etc.\r\n\r\nThe masculine body has evolved to a greater extent than the feminine\r\nbody as a force-producing machine, for in man the bones and the muscles\r\nhave a larger development, whereas in woman we observe a greater\r\ndevelopment of fat, whereby the plasticity of the body is enhanced, but\r\nits mechanical utility and energy are impaired.\r\n\r\nAccording to the most recent scientific representation of sexual\r\ndifferences, as we find them enumerated in the monograph of Oskar\r\nSchultze, based upon his own observations, and also on the earlier works\r\nof Vierordt, Quetelet, Topinard, Pfitzner, Waldeyer, C. H. Stratz, J.\r\nRanke, E. von Lange, Havelock Ellis, Merkel, Bischoff, Rebentisch,\r\nWelcker, Schwalbe, Marchand, and others, the most important physical\r\ndifferentiæ between man and woman are the following:\r\n\r\nThe supporting framework of the body, the osseous skeleton, exhibits\r\nimportant differences in man and woman. The bones of women are on the\r\nwhole smaller and weaker. Especially extensive sexual differences are\r\nnoticeable in the pelvis. Wiedersheim regards these sexual differences\r\nof the woman’s pelvis as a specific characteristic of the human species.\r\nIn all the anthropoid apes they are far less strongly marked than in\r\nman. Moreover, these differences exhibit a progressive development,\r\nwhich is to an important extent dependent upon advancing civilization.\r\nFor this reason, as G. Fritsch, Alsberg, and others, point out, among\r\nthe majority of savage races the differences between the male and the\r\nfemale pelvis are far less extensive than among civilized nations. The\r\ncharacteristic peculiarities of the pelvis of the European woman, which\r\ncan be distinguished from the male pelvis at a glance--namely, its\r\ngreater extent in transverse diameter, the greater depression and the\r\nwider opening of the anterior osseous arch--are far less marked among\r\nwomen of the South African races and among the South Sea Islanders.\r\n\r\nThe enlargement of the female pelvis in the course of human evolution is\r\ndependent upon the most important of all the factors of civilization,\r\nthe =brain=. Even in the human fœtus the great size of the brain gives\r\nrise to a far greater proportionate development of the skull than we\r\nfind in the fœtus of any other mammal. This influences the pelvic inlet\r\nand the sacrum, but also the large pelvis, since, in consequence of the\r\nadoption by man of the upright posture, the pregnant uterus expands more\r\nlaterally, and thus opens out the iliac fossæ. In the lower races of\r\nman, it is precisely this plate-like expansion of the iliac fossæ which\r\nis so much less developed than in the case of civilized races.\r\n\r\nAnother physical difference between the sexes concerns =stature= and\r\n=body-weight=.\r\n\r\nThe mean stature of woman is somewhat less than that of man. Among\r\nEuropeans it is about 1·60 metres (5 feet 3 inches), as compared with\r\n1·72 metres (5 feet 7-3/4 inches) for the average stature of the male.\r\nAccording to Vierordt, the new-born boy is already on the average from\r\n1/2 to 1 centimetre (1/5 to 2/5 inch) longer than the new-born girl.\r\nJohannes Ranke characterizes the individual factors which give rise to\r\nthese differences in the following manner:\r\n\r\n  “The typical bodily development of the human male is characterized by\r\n  a trunk relatively shorter in relation to the whole stature; but in\r\n  relation to the length of the trunk, the upper and the lower\r\n  extremities are longer, the thighs and the legs longer, the hand and\r\n  the foot also longer; relatively to the long upper arm and to the long\r\n  thigh respectively, the forearm and the leg are still longer; and\r\n  relatively to the entire upper extremity, the entire lower extremity\r\n  is also longer.\r\n\r\n  “On the other hand, the feminine proportions, remaining more\r\n  approximate to those of the youthful state, as compared with those of\r\n  the fully developed male, are distinguished by the following\r\n  characteristics: comparatively greater length of the trunk; relatively\r\n  to the length of the trunk, comparatively shorter arms and lower\r\n  extremities, shorter upper arm and forearm, shorter thigh and leg,\r\n  shorter hands and feet; relatively to the shorter upper arm, still\r\n  shorter forearm, and relatively to the shorter thigh, still shorter\r\n  leg; finally, relatively to the entire upper extremity, shorter lower\r\n  extremities.”\r\n\r\nThis difference in the stature is found also in primitive peoples. Among\r\nthe savage races of Brazil, who are still living in the stone age, Karl\r\nvon den Steinen found that the average height of the men was 162\r\ncentimetres (5 feet 3·8 inches), whilst that of the women was 10·5\r\ncentimetres (4·14 inches) less. This difference corresponds exactly with\r\nthat given in Topinard’s figures as corresponding to the average male\r\nheight of 162 centimetres (5 feet 3·8 inches).\r\n\r\nIn relation to the greater length of the body, the other proportions of\r\nthe male body also exhibit greater figures. More particularly, the width\r\nof the shoulders is greater in man as compared with woman.\r\n\r\nThe body-weight of man is likewise notably greater than that of woman.\r\nAccording to Vierordt, the average weight of a new-born boy in middle\r\nEurope is 3,333 grammes (7·348 pounds), as compared with that of a\r\nnew-born girl 3,200 grammes (7·055 pounds). The difference, therefore,\r\nis 133 grammes (0·293 pounds = about 4-1/2 ounces). In the case of\r\nadults, the mean difference amounts to 7 kilogrammes (15 pounds), since\r\nthe average weight of man is 65 kilogrammes (143 pounds), that of woman\r\n58 kilogrammes (128 pounds).\r\n\r\nCorresponding with the slighter development of the skeleton, the\r\n=muscular system= in woman is also less strongly developed; the muscles\r\ncontain a larger percentage of water than those of man, and in this\r\npoint also we find a resemblance to the juvenile state.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, =the development of fat= in woman is much greater\r\nthan in man. Bischoff investigated the relations between muscle and fat\r\nin man and woman, and found that in the entire body in the male there\r\nwas 41·8 per cent. muscle and 18·2 per cent. fat; in the female 35·8 per\r\ncent. muscle and 28·2 per cent. fat. In the female two regions of the\r\nbody are distinguished by a specially abundant deposit of fat, the\r\nbreast and the buttocks, whereby both parts receive the stamp of\r\nextremely prominent secondary sexual characters. Upon this greater\r\ndeposit of fat depends the softer, more rounded form of the feminine\r\nbody; whilst the muscular system is less developed than in man. Man, on\r\nthe other hand, is especially powerful in the head, neck, breast, and\r\nupper extremities. The contrast between the typical beauty of man and\r\nwoman, respectively, is mainly explicable by the differences just\r\nenumerated.\r\n\r\nWoman’s =skin= is clearer and more delicate than that of man.\r\n\r\nMore important is the fact that the blood of man contains a notably\r\nlarger quantity of =red blood-corpuscles= (erythrocytes) than that of\r\nwoman. Woman’s blood is richer in water. Welcker found in a cubic\r\nmillimetre of man’s blood 5,000,000, and in the same quantity of woman’s\r\nblood 4,500,000 blood-discs. In correspondence with this, the hæmoglobin\r\ncontent and the specific weight of woman’s blood are both less than\r\nthose of man’s. Since the red blood-corpuscles play a very important\r\npart in the human economy as oxygen-carriers, this sexual difference in\r\nthe corpuscular richness of the blood is very important, and influences\r\nto a high degree the bodily organization of both sexes.\r\n\r\n=Larynx= and =voice= remain infantile in woman. Woman’s larynx is\r\nnotably smaller than man’s. After puberty woman’s voice is, on the\r\naverage, in the deep tones an octave, in the high tones two octaves,\r\nhigher than man’s.\r\n\r\nAccording to the investigations of Pfitzner, the measurements of the\r\n=head= (length, breadth, height, circumference) are smaller in woman\r\nthan in man. Woman’s skull remains, in respect of numerous\r\npeculiarities of structure, strikingly like the skull of the child.[21]\r\nThis infantile quality of a woman’s skull, we must again point out,\r\njustifies =no= conclusion regarding the inferiority of woman. Schultze,\r\nwhen presenting these data for our consideration, rightly reminds us of\r\nthe well-known fact that the man of genius is also frequently\r\ndistinguished by infantile peculiarities.\r\n\r\nWoman’s skull is absolutely smaller than man’s; hence, of course, her\r\nbrain is also absolutely smaller. Waldeyer gives as the mean weight of a\r\nman’s brain 1,372 grammes (44·12 ounces), and of a woman’s brain, 1,231\r\ngrammes (39·58 ounces); Schwalbe’s figures are respectively 1,375\r\ngrammes (44·21 ounces) and 1,245 grammes (40·03 ounces).\r\n\r\nIn this connexion O. Schultze remarks:\r\n\r\n  “The question immediately arises, whether we are justified in speaking\r\n  of the mental ‘inferiority’ of woman, because her brain weighs less\r\n  than that of man.\r\n\r\n  “Now, in the first place, it is obvious that the greater body-weight\r\n  of man demands a greater weight of brain. And there is nothing\r\n  remarkable about the fact that the greater size exhibited by many\r\n  organs of the male should be exhibited also by the brain. It seems\r\n  very natural that the unquestionably greater functional activity which\r\n  has distinguished the masculine brain for many thousand years should\r\n  be manifested by the notably greater size of that organ, just as a\r\n  larger muscle generally performs more work than a small one.\r\n\r\n  “As a matter of fact, among the numerous investigators occupied with\r\n  this question, many have assumed that differences in the psychical\r\n  power of human brains are dependent upon differences in their size.\r\n  But this is an =assumption= merely, and with Bischoff, who as long as\r\n  forty years ago conducted an exhaustive investigation into the problem\r\n  of the relations between brain-weight and intellectual capacity, we\r\n  must say also to-day that ‘the proof of any such connexion has =not=\r\n  yet been offered us.’”\r\n\r\nWhether the study of the finer structure of the brain in man and woman\r\nwill enable us to form more trustworthy conclusions regarding their\r\nrespective intellectual valuation, is a question whose answer must for\r\nthe present be postponed. According to Rüdinger and Passet, in new-born\r\nboys and girls there exist very remarkable differences in the formation\r\nand development of the brain. In the male fœtal brain the frontal lobes\r\nare larger, wider, and higher; the convolutions, especially those of\r\nthe parietal lobe, are better formed than in the female fœtal brain.\r\nWaldeyer was able to confirm this observation, and he considers it of\r\ngreat importance, especially in view of the large share which the\r\nfrontal lobes have in the performance of purely intellectual functions.\r\nBroca, however, was unable to detect a lesser development of the frontal\r\nlobes in woman. Eberstaller and Cunningham even believed that they could\r\nestablish that this portion of the brain was more powerfully developed\r\nin woman! Finally, the great Swedish cerebral anatomist, G. Retzius,\r\nmade an exact investigation of the sexual differences between the brains\r\nof man and woman in the adult state. According to O. Schultze, his\r\nresults can be regarded as authoritative. Retzius stated that =hitherto\r\nno specific invariably recurrent peculiarity had been found by which the\r\nfemale brain could always with certainty be distinguished from the male;\r\nstill, he was inclined to attribute to woman’s brain a greater\r\nsimplicity of structure; it showed less divergence from the fundamental\r\ntype=.\r\n\r\nThis coincides with the fact to which we have already alluded, that\r\nwoman as compared with man possesses less variability, that she is the\r\nsimpler, more primitive being. Similarly, experience teaches\r\nethnologists that the men of a race differ from one another to a much\r\ngreater extent than the women.[22]\r\n\r\nIf we wish to sum up in a word the =nature= of the physical sexual\r\ndifferences, we must say: =Woman remains more akin to the child than\r\nman.=\r\n\r\nThis, however, in no way constitutes an inferiority, as Havelock Ellis\r\nand Oskar Schultze have convincingly shown. It is only the expression of\r\n=a primitive difference in nature=, brought about by the adaptation of\r\nthe female body to the purposes of reproduction. This is the cause of\r\nthe more infantile habitus of women (according to the above-quoted\r\nbiological law of Herbert Spencer).\r\n\r\nThe observation of the physical differences between man and woman also\r\nteaches us the futility of the old dispute as to whether man’s body or\r\nwoman’s was the more beautiful.[23] The different tasks which lie\r\nbefore the male and female bodies respectively give rise to different\r\ndevelopment of individual parts. If this development is complete in its\r\nkind, the body is beautiful. Stratz, in the introduction to his book on\r\n“The Beauty of the Female Body,” has rightly =identified perfect beauty\r\nwith perfect health=. Man’s body and woman’s will alike be beautiful if\r\nall secondary sexual characters are developed in a harmonious and not\r\nexcessive degree, if the idea of “manliness in man” and “womanliness in\r\nwoman” have attained full expression, and have not been unduly limited\r\nby isolated peculiarities and variations.\r\n\r\nMasculine and feminine beauty are different. There can be no question\r\nregarding the superiority of one or the other.\r\n\r\n  [19] Another author--H. Quensel--goes even farther than this in his\r\n  book (in some respects most fantastic), “Do We Advance? An Ideal\r\n  Philosophical Hypothesis of the Evolution of the Human Psyche based\r\n  upon Natural Science,” pp. 152, 153 (Cologne, 1904). He writes: “When\r\n  we compare the position in civilization of man and woman, we find that\r\n  man unquestionably takes the higher position in respect of those\r\n  intellectual impulses which serve as the basis of the higher and the\r\n  highest stages of civilization, especially the impulse of building and\r\n  construction, of the collection and the elaboration of scientific\r\n  facts, in regard to the science of statesmanship and social\r\n  activities, in respect also of the study of the connexion between\r\n  cause and effect, and in respect of art. When, however, we apply to\r\n  the problem before us the data I have obtained concerning the details\r\n  of physical retrogression and of psychical advance, it appears that\r\n  woman in many relations stands unquestionably higher than man; for\r\n  woman, in her development, not alone in bodily relations, as regards\r\n  the retrogression of the skeletal and muscular systems and the\r\n  delicacy of constitution dependent thereon, as regards the cutaneous\r\n  covering of the body, and as regards speech and voice, has advanced\r\n  much farther than man on the path of bodily retrogression necessary\r\n  for the progress of civilization. Positively, also, in all that\r\n  concerns the development of the highest psychical impulses, the\r\n  development of general nervous sensibility, of a finer discrimination\r\n  of moral values and of idealism, of general charity and capacity for\r\n  self-sacrifice in association with diminishing egoism, of\r\n  transcendental piety and religious sentiment, and also of clearness of\r\n  vision, and, finally, in all that concerns the development of an\r\n  adaptability disclosing supreme psychical differentiation--associated,\r\n  indeed, with deficient fixity of purpose--woman has advanced far\r\n  beyond man on the forward path of civilization; that is to say, in\r\n  respect of civilization, woman unquestionably excels man.”\r\n\r\n  [20] W. Havelburg, in his essay, “Climate, Race, and Nationality in\r\n  Relation to Marriage,” published in “Health and Disease in Relation to\r\n  Marriage and the Married State,” by Senator and Kaminer, p. 127\r\n  (London, Rebman, Limited, 1904), also alludes to the significance of\r\n  progressive sexual differentiation in the process of civilization, and\r\n  draws attention to the increase in feminine beauty.\r\n\r\n  [21] We may refer also to Paul Bartel’s valuable work, “Ueber\r\n  Geschlechtsunterschiede am Schädel”--“Sexual Differences in the Skull”\r\n  (Berlin, 1898). The author concludes: “We are unable to recognize any\r\n  important difference between man’s skull and woman’s--probably,\r\n  indeed, no such difference exists.”\r\n\r\n  [22] We must not ignore the fact, that other distinguished\r\n  anthropologists, such as Manouvrier, Pearson, Frassetto, and\r\n  especially Giuffrida-Ruggieri, have recently contested the slighter\r\n  variability and the infantile character of woman. _Cf._\r\n  Giuffrida-Ruggieri, “Anthropological Considerations regarding\r\n  Infantilism, and Conclusions regarding the Origin of the Varieties of\r\n  the Human Species” (_Italian Zoological Review_, 1903, vol. xiv., Nos.\r\n  4, 5). _Cf._ also the interesting remarks of Näcke in the “German\r\n  Archives for Criminal Anthropology,” 1903, vol. xiii., pp. 292, 293.\r\n\r\n  [23] Konrad Lange--“Das Wesen der Kunst” (“The Nature of Art”), pp.\r\n  361-364; Berlin, 1901--has ably exposed the subjective grounds of this\r\n  ancient dispute, and has shown their untenability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nPSYCHICAL DIFFERENTIAL SEXUAL CHARACTERS--THE WOMAN’S QUESTION\r\n\r\n\r\n(Appendix: SEXUAL SENSIBILITY IN WOMAN)\r\n\r\n“_Among all the higher activities and movements of our time, the\r\nstruggle of our sisters to attain an equality of position with the\r\nstrong, the dominant, the oppressive sex, appears to me, from the purely\r\nhuman point of view, most beautiful and most interesting; indeed, I\r\nregard it as possible that the coming century will obtain its historical\r\ncharacterization, not from any of the social and economical\r\ncontroversies of the world of men, but that this century will be known\r\nto subsequent history distinctively as that in which the solution of the\r\n‘woman’s question’ was obtained._”--GEORG HIRTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS OF CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n  The fact of psychical sexual differences -- Attempts to deny their\r\n  existence -- Rosa Mayreder’s “Critique of Femininity” -- The sexual\r\n  nuances of the psyche -- Ineradicability of these -- Condemnation of\r\n  psychical bisexuality -- Expression of psychical difference in the\r\n  demeanour of the sperm cell and the germ cell -- Original\r\n  representatives of the differing natures of man and woman -- Recent\r\n  researches regarding psychical sexual differences -- Sensory\r\n  sensations -- Intellectual differences -- Experiments of Jastrow,\r\n  Minot, and others -- Inquiries of Delaunay and Havelock Ellis --\r\n  Readier suggestibility of women -- Tendencies to independent activity\r\n  on the part of women -- Higher spiritual activities in man and woman\r\n  -- Woman’s talent for politics -- Emotivity of woman -- Greater\r\n  susceptibility to fatigue -- Decline of emotivity in the modern woman\r\n  -- Artistic talents of man and woman -- Greater variability of man --\r\n  Influence of menstruation on the feminine physique -- Psychological\r\n  experiments of H.

Psychically, also, man and woman are completely\r\n=different= beings. We must not employ the word “psychical,” as it is so\r\noften employed, in the sense of pure “intelligence”; we must understand\r\nthe term to relate to the entire conception and content of the psyche,\r\nto the whole spiritual being--the spiritual habitus, emotional\r\ncharacter, feelings, and will: we shall then immediately be convinced\r\nthat masculine and feminine beings differ through and through, that they\r\nare heterogeneous, incomparable natures.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of Weininger’s book, the attempt has recently been\r\nmade to deny the existence of sexual differences in the psychical\r\nsphere, and especially to contest the origin of these differences from\r\nthe fundamentally different nature of the masculine and feminine types.\r\n(Weininger himself not only went so far as to declare the obliteration\r\nand equalization of sexual differences, but he even asserted that all\r\nfeminine nature was a personification of nothingness, of evil; he wished\r\nto annihilate femininity, in order to allow the existence of one sex\r\nonly, the male, this being to him the embodiment of the objective and\r\nthe good.) I recently read with great interest a most intelligent book,\r\none full of new ideas, by Rosa Mayreder--“Zur Kritik der Weiblichkeit”\r\n(A Critique of Femininity), Jena, 1905--in which the author maintains\r\nwhat she calls the “primitively teleological character of sexuality”;\r\nthat is, she considers the different sexual functions of man and woman\r\nto be comparatively unimportant for the determination of their spiritual\r\nnature, and regards the individual psychical differentiation as\r\nindependent of sexuality and of the different sexual natures. In her\r\nopinion, sexual polarity does not extend to the “higher nature” of\r\nmankind, to the spiritual sphere. She offers as a proof of this, among\r\nother points, the fact that by crossed inheritance spiritual\r\npeculiarities of the father can be transmitted to the daughter. Very\r\ntrue. Moreover, no objective student of Nature will deny that a woman\r\ncan attain the same degree of individual psychical differentiation as a\r\nman, or that she can bring her “higher nature” to an equally great\r\ndevelopment. But quite as incontestable is the fact which Rosa Mayreder\r\nkeeps too much in the background: =that everything psychical, the\r\nentire emotional and voluntary life, receives from the particular sexual\r\nnature a peculiar characterization, a distinctive colouring, and a\r\nspecific nuance=; and that these precisely constitute the heterogeneous\r\nand the incomparable in the masculine and the feminine natures.\r\n\r\nThe attempts to annihilate sexual differences in theory are very\r\nold,[24] but they have always proved untenable in practice. They have\r\ninvariably been shattered by contact with--sexual differences.\r\n\r\n_Naturam expellas furca, tamen usque recurret_ (You may drive out Nature\r\nwith a pitchfork, but she will inevitably return). And this return of\r\nNature is, in fact, a =step forward=, in advance of primitive\r\nhermaphroditic states. Sexual differences are ineradicable; civilization\r\nshows an unmistakable tendency to increase them. There is also an\r\nindividual differentiation of sexual characters. It is proportional to\r\nthe differentiation of the psychical characters of man and woman. And\r\nthe problem is this: How is it possible for woman to ensure the\r\ndevelopment and perfectibility of her higher nature, without eliminating\r\nand obscuring her peculiar character as a sexual being?\r\n\r\nWhen Rosa Mayreder herself, at the end of her book (p. 278), comes to\r\nthe conclusion--\r\n\r\n  “In the province of the physical, about which no doubt is possible,\r\n  the development towards ‘homologous monosexuality,’ towards =the\r\n  unconditional sexual differentiation of individuals=, =constitutes the\r\n  most desirable aim=. Every =divergence= from the normal renders the\r\n  individual an imperfect being; =physical hermaphroditism is repulsive=\r\n  because it represents a state of insufficiency, an inadequate and\r\n  malformed structure. It appertains to the qualities of beautiful and\r\n  healthy human beings that the body should be that of an entire man or\r\n  an entire woman, just as it is desirable that the body should be\r\n  intact in all other respects”\r\n\r\n--she has at the same time expressed a judgment regarding the value of\r\npsychical bisexuality which =must ever be a rudiment merely= in the\r\n“entire man” or the “entire woman,” and can never attain the\r\ntranscendent importance, can never represent the progress towards higher\r\naltitudes, which the author, in her singular misunderstanding of the\r\ntrue relations, wishes to ascribe to that condition. We may admit that\r\nthe bisexual character is more or less strongly developed in the\r\nindividual male or female, without thereby abandoning the fundamental\r\nnatural difference between man and woman, which involves not merely the\r\nphysical, but also the psychical sphere.\r\n\r\nI disbelieve, therefore, in Rosa Mayreder’s “synthetic human being,” who\r\nis “subordinate alike to the conditions of the masculine and the\r\nfeminine” but I do believe, as I have already stated in earlier\r\nwritings, in an individualization of love, in an ennobling and deepening\r\nof the relationship between the sexes, such as is possible only to free\r\npersonalities. This is easily attainable in conjunction with the\r\nretention of all bodily and mental peculiarities, as these have\r\ndeveloped during the process of sexual differentiation between man and\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nThere can be no possible doubt that psychically woman is a different\r\ncreature from man. And quite rightly Mantegazza declares the opinion of\r\nMirabeau, that the soul has no sex, but only the body, to be a great\r\nblunder.\r\n\r\nLet us now return to the directly visible elementary phenomenon of love,\r\nto the process of coalescence of the spermatozoon and the ovum. From our\r\nstudy of other natural processes we feel we are justified by analogy in\r\ndrawing the conclusion that the observed kinetic difference between the\r\nspermatozoon and the ovum is the expression also of different psychical\r\nprocesses. Georg Hirth draws attention to these remarkable =differences\r\nin respect of their modes of energy= between spermatozoa and ova.[25] He\r\nalso infers from the greater variability of the spermatozoa in the\r\ndifferent animal species, as compared with the usual spherical form of\r\nthe ova, that to the spermatozoon is allotted the most important kinetic\r\nfunction in the process of reproduction, to which opinion its aggressive\r\nmobility would also lead us, whereas the ovum rather represents\r\npotential energy.\r\n\r\n  “We can indeed hardly believe that anywhere in the entire organic\r\n  world is there anything, of the same minute size, endowed with like\r\n  energy and enterprise as these so-called spermatozoa (‘little sperm\r\n  animals’), which are indeed not animals, and which yet prepare for us\r\n  more joy and more sorrow than any animal does. There everything is\r\n  busy. With what turbulence they hurry along until they attain their\r\n  ardently desired goal, and having attained it, thrust themselves head\r\n  first into the interior of the ovum! In this we have a drama for the\r\n  gods. To doubt the energy of these structures would be preposterous.”\r\n\r\nSpermatozoa and ova are the original representatives of the respective\r\nspiritual natures of man and woman. Disregarding all further\r\ndifferentiation and individualization, the =fundamental lineaments= of\r\nthe masculine and feminine natures harmonize with the demeanour of the\r\nreproductive cells; and we are able to recognize that for each is\r\nprovided a =different= task, and yet that =the task of each is no less\r\nimportant than that of the other=. Quite rightly Rosa Mayreder points\r\nout, that the male sex stands biologically no higher than the female\r\nfrom the reproductive and procreative point of view; that in the\r\ncontinued reproduction of life male and female have equal share.\r\n\r\nNo less true, on the other hand, is the remark of Havelock Ellis, whose\r\nposition in relation to the woman question is throughout objective:\r\n\r\n  “As long as women are distinguished from men by primary sexual\r\n  characters--as long, that is to say, as they conceive and bear--so\r\n  long will they remain unequal to man in the highest psychical\r\n  processes” (“Man and Woman,” p. 21).\r\n\r\nThe nature of man is aggressive, progressive, variable; that of woman is\r\nreceptive, more susceptible to stimuli, simpler.\r\n\r\nNumerous exact, scientific, ethnological, and psychological\r\ninvestigations concerning the sexes, among the most important of which\r\nwe may mention those of Darwin, Allan, Münsterberg, C. Vogt,\r\nPloss-Bartels, Jastrow, Lombroso and Ferrero, Shaw, Havelock Ellis, and\r\nHelen Bradford Thompson, have confirmed the existence of these\r\ndifferences in the nature of the two sexes. Many individual points still\r\nremain obscure, but the above-mentioned sexual difference is everywhere\r\nrecognizable, and can never be entirely eradicated, even by a higher\r\npsychical differentiation. Even the author of the “Critique of\r\nFemininity,” who would open an unlimited perspective to the freedom of\r\nindividuality, is still compelled to admit that the majority of women\r\ndiffer from men, no less in character than in intellect.\r\n\r\nHavelock Ellis, in his classical work “Man and Woman” (London, 1892),\r\nhas given a summary of the psychical differences between the sexes,\r\nbased upon the most recent anthropological and psychological\r\ninvestigations. This work forms the foundation for all later researches.\r\n\r\nOf the individual psychical phenomena in man and woman, the sensory\r\nsensations first demand consideration. In these no absolute and general\r\nsuperiority of one sex over the other can be shown to exist. The\r\nassumption that women have a more delicate power of sensory receptivity\r\ncannot be sustained; indeed, the contrary appears the truer view. It is\r\ntrue that women can be more readily excited by sensory stimuli, but they\r\ndo not possess a more delicate sensory receptivity.\r\n\r\nAs regards the general =intellectual endowment= of the sexes, the\r\ninteresting experimental researches of Jastrow into the psychology of\r\nwoman show that she possesses a greater interest in her immediate\r\nenvironment, in the finished product, in the decorative, the individual,\r\nand the concrete; man, on the other hand, exhibits a preference for the\r\nmore remote, for that which is in process of construction or growth, for\r\nthe useful, the general, and the abstract.\r\n\r\nIn agreement with these views is a report in the _Berliner Städtischen\r\nJahrbuch_ (1870, pp. 59-77), concerning the knowledge possessed by\r\nseveral thousands of boys and girls at the time of their entry into\r\nschool. The report states:\r\n\r\n  “The more usual, the more approximate, and the easier an idea is, the\r\n  greater is the probability that the girls will excel the boys, and\r\n  _vice versa_. In boys more frequently than in girls do we find that\r\n  they know nothing of quite common things in their immediate\r\n  environment.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Minot arranged that persons of both sexes should cover ten\r\ncards with sketches of any subject they chose. It appeared from this\r\nexperiment that the sketches of the men embraced a greater variety of\r\nsubjects than those of the women.\r\n\r\nIn respect of quickness of comprehension and intellectual mobility woman\r\nis distinctly superior to man. Women, for example, read faster than men,\r\nand can give a better account of what they have read. From this fact,\r\nhowever, no conclusion can be drawn regarding their higher intellectual\r\ncapacity, for many men of exceptional intelligence read very slowly.\r\n\r\nDelaunay inquired of a number of merchants regarding the industrial\r\ncapacity of the two sexes, and was informed that women are more diligent\r\nthan men, but less intelligent, so that they can be trusted only in\r\nroutine work.\r\n\r\nIn general, the experience of the postal service coincided with what has\r\nalready been stated. Havelock Ellis regarded the result of an inquiry\r\nmade at several of the large English post-offices as “typical and\r\ntrustworthy.” One of the chief postmasters was of the opinion that as\r\ncounter and instrumental clerks, doing concurrently money-order and\r\nsavings-bank business, taking in telegrams and signalling and receiving,\r\nand in attending to rough and illiterate persons, women clerks were\r\npreferable to men. Women telegraphists work as intelligently and as\r\nexactly as their male colleagues. They do not, however, like the men,\r\nexhibit an interest in the technical working of telegraphy; and, owing\r\nto a lack of staying power, they are unable to compete with the men in\r\ntimes of pressure. The comparatively slighter strength of the wrist made\r\nit difficult for women telegraphists to write at the desired speed, and\r\nto produce the requisite number of copies.\r\n\r\nAll the reports agree in this--that\r\n\r\n  “Women are more docile and amenable to discipline, they do light work\r\n  as well as men, and are steadier in some respects; on the other hand,\r\n  they more often remain away from work on the ground of trifling\r\n  indisposition, are more likely to fail to meet severe demands, and\r\n  show less intelligence in respect of tasks lying outside the course of\r\n  their current work, and in general show less desire and less capacity\r\n  for self-culture.”\r\n\r\nUnquestionable is the =greater suggestibility= of women, doubtless\r\ndependent on organic peculiarities, in consequence of which they so\r\nquickly become subject to the influence of persons and opinions, when\r\nthe latter exercise a sufficiently powerful effect upon their emotional\r\nlife. The independent, the poietic,[26] are more distant from women, are\r\nmore foreign to their nature, than in the case of men. But that these\r\nare quite impossible to them I am compelled to doubt. And when, for\r\nexample, Havelock Ellis considers it unthinkable that a woman should\r\nhave discovered the Copernican system, I need merely call to mind the\r\nwidely known physical discoveries of Madame Curie, whose thoroughly\r\nindependent work qualified her to succeed her husband as professor at\r\nthe Sorbonne. We cannot therefore exclude the possibility that in the\r\nsphere of the natural sciences notable discoveries and inventions may be\r\nmade in the future in consequence of the independent work of women.\r\n\r\nVery interesting are the observations of Paul Lafitte on the differences\r\nbetween the higher intellectual qualities of man and woman. After\r\ndrawing attention to the greater receptivity of woman, he says:\r\n\r\n  “When children of both sexes are educated together, during the first\r\n  year the girls lead; at this time they have to do chiefly with the\r\n  reception and retention of impressions, and we see every day that\r\n  women put men in the shade by the vividness of their impressions and\r\n  the excellence of their memory. In addition to this we must take into\r\n  account the inborn sense of women for symmetry, from which it is\r\n  readily explicable that they generally receive geometrical instruction\r\n  with very beneficial results. In correspondence with this, we find\r\n  that woman students of medicine excel in the examinations in\r\n  physiology and general pathology, and show a clearness of apprehension\r\n  of series of facts which is really remarkable; on the other hand, they\r\n  are distinctly inferior in clinical investigations, in which other\r\n  intellectual qualities are involved. In general, women are more\r\n  receptive for facts than for laws, more for the concrete than for\r\n  general ideas. If we chance to hear an opinion expressed regarding\r\n  someone with whom we are acquainted, a man’s opinion will probably be\r\n  more accurate in the general outlines, but a woman’s will show a\r\n  clearer perception of the nuances of character.”\r\n\r\nThus it is that among women concrete philosophers are greater favourites\r\nthan abstract metaphysicians. According to the experience of a London\r\nbookseller, ladies of the West End of London prefer Schopenhauer, Plato,\r\nMarcus Aurelius, Epictetus, and Renan; that is to say, the most\r\nconcrete, the most personal, the most poetical, and the most religious\r\nof thinkers. This last quality especially fascinates the mind of woman.\r\nAt the same time, want of relationship between the strong suggestibility\r\nof woman and her slight power of independent production also strikingly\r\nmanifests itself in woman’s position with regard to the =religious=\r\nphenomena of the spiritual life. Havelock Ellis shows that ninety-nine\r\nin every hundred of the great religious movements of the world have\r\nreceived their initial impulse from men. And yet it has always been\r\nwomen who have been the first to attach themselves to the founders of\r\nreligions.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with this, women appear to possess more independent\r\nsignificance in the sphere of =politics=, as is shown by the fact that\r\nthere has been such a large number of celebrated women rulers.\r\nDiplomatic adroitness, finesse, and self-command, to the extent to which\r\nthese qualities favour political activity, are indeed specific feminine\r\npeculiarities.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned greater suggestibility of woman is connected with\r\nher greater =emotivity=; that is, woman reacts to physical and psychical\r\nstimuli more quickly than man. The “vasomotor theory” of the emotions,\r\noriginated by Mosso and C. Lange, is true to a greater extent of woman\r\nthan of man. Woman’s neuro-muscular system is more irritable, as is\r\nespecially shown in the case of the pupil of the eye, and in that of the\r\nurinary bladder. By Mosso and Pellacani the bladder is termed the most\r\nsensitive psychometer in the body. Contraction of the bladder is well\r\nknown to occur in many emotional states, such as fear, expectation,\r\ntension, and bashfulness. This is much commoner in women and children\r\nthan in men. The fact that in women under the influence of strong\r\nexcitement there arises a powerful impulse to urinate, is a fact\r\nextremely well known to medical men and others with special\r\nopportunities for observation.\r\n\r\nThe greater neuro-muscular irritability of woman may also be explained\r\nas the result of the relatively greater size of her abdominal organs.\r\n\r\nTo this greater =irritability= of woman there corresponds a =greater\r\nsusceptibility to fatigue=. It appears as a result of any long-lasting\r\ntask; it is, in fact, a safeguard against over-exertion, which in man so\r\ncommonly leads to complete exhaustion, because he works =too= long. The\r\nease with which a woman becomes exhausted is no doubt partly dependent\r\nupon the physiological anæmia to which we alluded in the last\r\nchapter--to the larger quantity of water and the smaller quantity of red\r\nblood-corpuscles (erythrocytes) in her blood.\r\n\r\nHavelock Ellis has detected a decline in the emotivity of modern woman,\r\nunder the influence of custom and education, especially as a result of\r\nthe great diffusion of bodily sports among girls. But he does not\r\nbelieve that anything of the kind can lead to a complete abolition of\r\nthe emotional differences between the sexes, since these depend upon\r\nfirmly established bodily differences, such as the greater extension of\r\nthe sexual sphere and of the visceral functions in woman, upon woman’s\r\nphysiological anæmia, and upon the more marked periodicity of her vital\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\n  “So many factors work in combination, in order to give a basis for the\r\n  play of the emotions, whose greater extension can be overcome by no\r\n  alteration of the _milieu_, or of custom. The emotivity of woman may\r\n  be reduced to finer and more delicate shades, but it can never be\r\n  brought down to the level of the emotivity of the male sex.”\r\n\r\nIn respect of =artistic endowment= the male sex is unquestionably\r\nsuperior to the female. The long series of male poets, musicians,\r\npainters, sculptors, of the highest genius cannot be matched by any\r\nnotable number of striking female personalities in the same sphere of\r\nartistic activity. Even the art of cooking has been further developed by\r\nmen. Without doubt the differences in sexuality are the principal causes\r\nof this deficiency. The impetuous, aggressive character of the male\r\nsexual impulse also favours poietic endeavours, the transformation of\r\nsexual energy into higher plastic activity, as it fulfils itself in the\r\nmoments of most exalted artistic conception. The greater variability of\r\nthe male also serves to explain the greater frequency of male artists\r\nof the first rank.\r\n\r\nJohn Hunter, Burdach, Darwin, Havelock Ellis, and others, have shown\r\nthat there exists a greater tendency on the part of man to divergence\r\nfrom type. In the course of evolution, man represents the more variable\r\nand progressive, woman the more monotonous and conservative, moiety\r\nof mankind. These differences find no less clear expression in\r\nthe psychical sphere. Notwithstanding increasing individual\r\ndifferentiation--in truth, affecting only the minority, the _élite_\r\namong women, as Rosa Mayreder very rightly insists--this great\r\ndifference in the variability of the sexes will ever continue. This\r\nbiological fact is certainly of great importance in respect of\r\ncivilization and of the relation between the sexes.\r\n\r\nIn a comparison between man and woman, the important fact of\r\n=menstruation= must never be forgotten. Menstruation is only the\r\nexpression, only a phase, of a continuous undulatory movement in the\r\nentire feminine organism. The intellectual and emotional state of woman\r\nis, beyond question, a different one in different phases of the monthly\r\ncycle. Icard, and recently Francillon (“Essai sur la Puberté chez la\r\nFemme”--“Essay on Puberty in Woman,” pp. 189-198; Paris, 1906), have\r\ngiven us exact information on this subject.\r\n\r\n  “In all tests of strength and cleverness,” says Havelock Ellis, “the\r\n  woman’s degree of strength and exactitude is related to the level of\r\n  her monthly curve. Moreover, in every criminal procedure, the relation\r\n  between the time of occurrence of the alleged crime and the accused’s\r\n  monthly cycle should invariably be taken into consideration.”\r\n\r\nThe results obtained by Helen Bradford Thompson by experimental research\r\nin her “Comparative Psychology of the Sexes” (Würzburg, 1905) agree in\r\ngeneral with the details we have already given as the result of earlier\r\nresearches. In her experiment also\r\n\r\n  “man proved better developed in respect of motor capacity and accuracy\r\n  of judgment. Woman had, indeed, sharper senses and a better memory.\r\n  The opinion, however, that emotional excitement plays a greater part\r\n  in the life of woman has not been confirmed. On the contrary, woman’s\r\n  greater tendency towards religion and towards superstition is a proof\r\n  of her conservative nature, of her function to guard established\r\n  beliefs and modes of action.”\r\n\r\nThus we cannot expel from the world the fact that man and woman are\r\neminently =different= alike physically and mentally. Whether, as Alfons\r\nBilharz declares, they are really throughout equivalent opposites, or,\r\nas he expresses the comparison, like +1 and -1, their sum is equivalent\r\nto nil, must remain at present undetermined. But that ineradicable\r\ndifferences exist is certain. There is no question here of an\r\ninferiority to man. What woman lacks on one side she has more of on\r\nanother. She is through and through a creature =constructed on other\r\nlines=, standing nearer to Nature than man, and for this reason, like\r\nNature, =problematical=, the great guardian of the secrets of Nature\r\n(Bärenbach).\r\n\r\n  “Who shall explain the wonderful\r\n   Magic power of woman?”\r\n\r\nsays Platen, thus touching an aspect of ancient German sentiment, which\r\nhas also found expression in the _sanctum aut providum_ of Tacitus.\r\nOvid, Byron, Börne, and Rousseau, have also described the wonderful and\r\nmysterious influence of woman’s nature, fundamentally different from\r\nthat of man. Most beautifully has it been described by Theodor Mundt in\r\nthe following magnificent passage of his book on Charlotte Stieglitz:\r\n\r\n  “The most secret elements of woman’s nature, in association with the\r\n  magic mystery of her organization, indicate the existence in her of\r\n  peculiar and deep-lying creative ideas, and in this wonderful riddle\r\n  of love we find the sympathetic of the entire universe expressed. The\r\n  sympathetic, which attracts and binds forces, the silent music in the\r\n  innermost being of the world’s soul, by means of which the stars, the\r\n  suns, bodies, spirits, are compelled to move in this eternal,\r\n  changeable rhythm, and in this continuous opposition--is the feminine\r\n  of the universe. This is the eternal feminine, of which Goethe says\r\n  that it draws us heavenward. Therefore there is nothing deeper, more\r\n  gentle, more unsearchable, than a woman’s heart. All-movable, it\r\n  extends into that wonderful distance of existence, and hears with fine\r\n  nerves the most hidden elements of existence. Touched and shaken by\r\n  every sound, like a spiritual harp, the most hidden aspects of nature\r\n  and of life often evoke in its strings prophetic oscillations. The\r\n  feminine is something common to all life, the most gentle psyche of\r\n  existence, and hence the fine connexion of the feminine nature with\r\n  the general organizations, operations, and world forces; hence the\r\n  mysterious force of attraction which exercises itself in such a magic\r\n  manner as the true pole of sex, as though each one only in, and with,\r\n  the true feminine could first find peace.... The ancients made a\r\n  remarkable use of this idea of a common feminine element in human\r\n  nature, inasmuch as by the name they gave to the pupil of the eye they\r\n  expressed the idea that =a young girl was to be found in every man’s\r\n  eye=. Young girls (pupillæ, κοραι)--these formed the centre of the\r\n  human eye, as Winkelmann points out; and is it possible to describe\r\n  the eye more aptly and distinctively, this radiant chiaroscuro of the\r\n  hidden basis of the soul, than by ascribing femininity to\r\n  it--femininity, which rises from that hidden basis of the soul as an\r\n  Anadyomene rises from the deep?”\r\n\r\nNietzsche speaks also of the “veil” of beautiful possibilities with\r\nwhich woman is covered, and which makes the charm of her life. This\r\nundefinable spiritual emanation, this dark, irrational element in woman,\r\nled von Hippel to coin the clever phrase that woman is a comma, man a\r\nfull-stop. “With man, you know where you are--you have come to an end;\r\nbut with woman, there is something more to be expected.” From this\r\ninward nature of woman there proceed immense results: the feminine\r\nessence is a civilizing factor of the first rank; were woman wanting,\r\ncivilization would be non-existent. Very beautifully has the great\r\nBuckle drawn attention to the indispensability of woman for the\r\nspiritual progress of mankind. He remarks that men, the slaves of\r\nexperience and of fact, have only the women to thank for the fact that\r\ntheir slavery has not become much more complete and more narrowing.\r\nWomen’s way of thinking, their spiritual care, their intercourse, their\r\ninfluence, diffuse themselves unnoticed through the whole of society,\r\nand take their place throughout its entire structure. By means of this\r\ninfluence, more than by any other cause, we men have been conducted,\r\nsays Buckle, to a completely thought-out world.\r\n\r\nThis obscure, wonderful nature of woman has, however, its shadowy side.\r\nUpon it depends that primitive, deeply-rooted =antipathy of the sexes=,\r\nwhich is due to their profound heterogeneity, to the impossibility that\r\nthey can ever really understand one another. Herein lie the roots of the\r\nbrutal enslavement of woman by man in the course of history; of the\r\nbelief in witchcraft; of contempt for women, and the continued renewal\r\nof theoretical misogyny. The victory of sexual love over this contrast\r\nis often apparent only. Leopardi, and Theophile Gautier (in\r\n“Mademoiselle de Maupin”), have shown how little woman understands the\r\ninner nature of man; how little man understands woman has been\r\npoetically described by Annette von Droste-Hülshoff.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, true love is an understanding of the contrasted\r\nnatures, a solution of the riddle. “Être aimé, c’est être compris,” says\r\nDelphine de Girardin.\r\n\r\nWhat significance for the so-called “woman’s question” has the\r\ndetermination of the existence of psychical sexual differences? We\r\nanswer: =The nature of woman, completely developed in all her\r\npeculiarities, and enriched throughout her being by all the spiritual\r\nelements of our times adequate to her being, ensures her an equal share\r\nin civilization and in the progress of humanity.=\r\n\r\nComplete equality between man and woman is impossible. But are all\r\nsides of woman’s nature as yet adequately worked upon, fully developed?\r\nIs not the civilized woman of the future still to be created? The true\r\nnucleus of the woman’s movement is, I conceive, to be found in the\r\nemancipation of woman from the dominion of pure sensuality, and from the\r\nnot less disastrous dominion of masculine spiritual arrogance. Have we\r\nmen really any right to pride ourselves to such a degree upon our\r\nknowledge and intelligence? Should we =without= woman have advanced\r\nanything like so far?\r\n\r\nA glance at the beginnings of human civilization should teach us a\r\nlittle modesty, for there we see that woman was equal, if not superior,\r\nto man in productive, poietic activity. Gradually only, in the progress\r\nof civilization, man supplanted woman, and monopolized all spheres of\r\nproductive activity, whilst woman was limited more and more to domestic\r\noccupations. According to Karl Bücher, to women were originally allotted\r\nall the labours connected with the obtaining and subsequent utilization\r\nof vegetable materials, also the provision of the apparatus and vessels\r\nnecessary for this purpose; to man, on the other hand, were allotted the\r\nchase, fishing, herding, and the provision of weapons and tools. Thus\r\nwoman was engaged in threshing and grinding the grain, in baking bread,\r\nin the preparation of food and drink, in the making of pots, and in\r\nspinning. Since these occupations are largely conducted in a rhythmical\r\nmanner, and the women worked together in the fields or in their huts,\r\nwhile the men hunted singly in the forests, it resulted that women were\r\nthe first creators of poetry and music.\r\n\r\n  “Not,” writes Bücher, “upon the steep summits of society did poetry\r\n  originate; it sprung rather from the depths of the pure strong soul of\r\n  the people. =Women have striven to produce it; and as civilized man\r\n  owes to woman’s work much the best of his possessions, so also are her\r\n  thought and her poetry interwoven in the spiritual treasure handed\r\n  down from generation to generation.= To follow the traces of woman’s\r\n  poetry farther, in the intellectual life of the people, would be a\r\n  valuable exercise. Although these traces have to a large extent\r\n  disappeared, during the subsequent period of man’s poetic activity,\r\n  which appears to have gained predominance in proportion as men\r\n  monopolized the labours of material production, still, in a number of\r\n  races the influence of woman’s poetry can be followed for a long way\r\n  into the literary period.”\r\n\r\n=To a large extent men first learned from women the elements of the\r\nvarious handicrafts.= For instance, as Mason says, primeval woman gave\r\nher “ulu”[27] to the saddler, and taught him the mode of preparing\r\nleather. Women were the first discoverers of numerous industries and\r\nhandicrafts. The further development of these in later times was the\r\nwork of men; men alone understood how to differentiate their work, while\r\nfrom the first it was inevitable that motherhood should greatly limit\r\nthe working powers of woman.\r\n\r\nIn the middle ages there still existed in Europe, especially in Germany\r\nand France, certain industries which were exclusively in the hands of\r\nwomen--for instance, the silk-spinners, silk-weavers, tailoresses, and\r\ngirdle-makers. In all these occupations there were mistresses, maids,\r\nand female apprentices. It was not until the sixteenth century that\r\nmanufactures became a monopoly of the male sex. In the eighteenth\r\ncentury women were actually forbidden by law to take part in\r\nmanufactures, until in recent times a reaction in their favour took\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nTherefore we must not from the present conditions judge the capacity of\r\nwomen for practical activity outside the home. I quite agree with\r\nGerland, who assumes that during this oppression of the female sex for\r\nthousands of years, a certain deteriorating influence must have been\r\nexercised, and I agree also with Havelock Ellis, who hopes much from the\r\ndevelopment in the civilization of the future of an equal freedom for\r\nman and woman, and who demands that we should acquire experience by\r\nunlimited experiment regarding the qualifications of the female sex for\r\nall departments of activity. Golden words as to the necessity for a\r\ncomprehensive emancipation of woman were uttered in 1865 by the\r\ncelebrated anthropologist Thomas Huxley, in his essay on\r\n“Emancipation--Black and White,” in which he strongly condemns the\r\npresent system for the education of girls:\r\n\r\n  “Let us have ‘sweet girl graduates’ by all means. They will be none\r\n  the less sweet for a little wisdom; and the ‘golden hair’ will not\r\n  curl less gracefully outside the head by reason of there being brains\r\n  within. Nay, if obvious practical difficulties can be overcome, let\r\n  those women who feel inclined to do so descend into the gladiatorial\r\n  arena of life, not merely in the guise of _retiariæ_, as heretofore,\r\n  but as bold _sicariæ_, breasting the open fray. Let them, if they so\r\n  please, become merchants, barristers, politicians. Let them have a\r\n  fair field, but let them understand, as the necessary correlative,\r\n  that they are to have no favour. Let Nature alone sit high above the\r\n  lists, ‘rain influence and judge the prize.’”\r\n\r\nAnd that men would maintain their old position cannot be doubted. The\r\nonly change would be that women, too, would take part in the work of\r\ncivilization.[28] They would introduce a new and fresh element into\r\nthis work; and inasmuch as every woman would be brought up\r\nsystematically with a view to her life’s work, the physically and\r\npsychically disastrous idleness of unmarried young girls, of “old\r\nmaids,” and of “misunderstood women,” would come to an end, and these\r\nunattractive types would pass away for ever. The work of mother and\r\nhousewife must, in correspondence with these changes, be more highly\r\nesteemed than has hitherto been the case. The technique and the theory\r\nof domestic economy can even now, with sufficient intelligence devoted\r\nto the question, be remodelled and transformed to a satisfying\r\nactivity.[29]\r\n\r\nWoman is an integral constituent of the processes of civilization,\r\nwhich, without her, becomes unthinkable. The present moment is a\r\nturning-point in the history of the feminine world. The woman of the\r\npast is disappearing, to give place to the woman of the future; instead\r\nof the bound, there appears the =free personality=.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX: SEXUAL SENSIBILITY IN WOMAN\r\n\r\nAn old and still unsettled subject of dispute is the strength and nature\r\nof sexual sensibility in woman. Whilst the manifestation of sexual\r\nappetite and sexual enjoyment in the male are fairly simple--and in man,\r\nas A. Eulenburg has proved, the copulatory impulse is much more powerful\r\nthan the reproductive impulse--the sexual sensibility of woman is still\r\ninvolved in obscurity. Magendie remarked that no two women are exactly\r\nalike in respect of their sexual sensations and perceptions. There is no\r\nquestion that among women the varieties of erotic type are far more\r\nnumerous than among men. Rosa Mayreder, for instance, distinguishes an\r\nerotic-eccentric, an altruistic-sentimental, and an egoistic-frigid\r\ntype. The attempt has been made to prove that the last-named type is the\r\nmost widely diffused--that it is, in fact, the characteristic type of\r\nwoman. Lombroso and Ferrero were the first to maintain the slight sexual\r\nsensibility of woman; Harry Campbell took the same view; and recently a\r\nBerlin physician--Dr. O. Adler--has published a book on the “Deficient\r\nSexual Sensibility of Woman,” the conclusions of which are that\r\n\r\n  “the sexual impulse (desire, libido) of woman is, alike in its first\r\n  spontaneous origin and in its later manifestation, notably less\r\n  intense than that of man; and further, that libido must first be\r\n  aroused in a suitable manner, and that often it never appears at all.”\r\n\r\nAlbert Eulenburg, in an article in _Zukunft_ (December 2, 1893), and\r\nlater in his “Sexual Neuropathy,” pp. 88, 89 (Leipzig, 1895), first\r\nopposed this doctrine of the physiological sexual anæsthesia of woman,\r\nand quoted in support of his view the following passage from the\r\nwritings of the celebrated gynæcologist Kisch:\r\n\r\n  “The sexual impulse is so powerful, in certain life periods it is an\r\n  elementary force which so overwhelmingly dominates the entire organism\r\n  of woman, that it leaves no room in her mind for thoughts of\r\n  reproduction; on the contrary, she greatly desires sexual intercourse\r\n  even when she is very much afraid of becoming pregnant or when there\r\n  can be no question of any pregnancy occurring” (see Kisch, “The Sexual\r\n  Life of Woman,” English translation, Rebman, 1908).\r\n\r\nI have myself asked a great many cultured women about this matter.\r\n=Without exception=, they declared the theory of the lesser sexual\r\nsensibility of women to be erroneous; many were even of opinion that\r\nsexual sensibility was greater and more enduring in woman than in\r\nman.[30]\r\n\r\nWhen we actually consider the physical bases of feminine sexuality, we\r\nmust admit that women’s sexual sphere is a much =more widely extended=\r\none than that of men. The author of “Splitter” has very well\r\ncharacterized this fact when he says:\r\n\r\n  “Women are in fact pure sex from knees to neck. We men have\r\n  concentrated our apparatus in a single place, we have extracted it,\r\n  separated it from the rest of the body, because _prèt à partir_. They\r\n  (women) are a great sexual =surface= or target; we =have= only a\r\n  sexual =arrow=. Procreation is their proper element, and when they are\r\n  engaged in it they remain at home in their own sphere; we for this\r\n  purpose must go elsewhere out of ourselves. In the matter of time also\r\n  our part in procreation is concentrated. We may devote to the matter\r\n  barely ten minutes; women give as many months. Properly speaking, they\r\n  procreate unceasingly, they stand continually at the witches’\r\n  cauldron, boiling and brewing; while we lend a hand merely in passing,\r\n  and do no more than throw one or two fragments into the vessel.”\r\n\r\nIt is possible, however, that the greater extension of the sexual sphere\r\nin woman gives rise, if one may use the expression, to a greater\r\ndispersal of sexual sensations, which are not, as they are in man,\r\nclosely concentrated to a particular point, and for this reason the\r\nspontaneous resolution of the libido (in the form of the sexual orgasm)\r\nis rendered more difficult.\r\n\r\nRecently Havelock Ellis has made a searching investigation into the\r\nnature of the sexual impulse in woman. He found the following\r\ndifferences by which it was distinguished from the sexual impulse of the\r\nmale:\r\n\r\n1. The sexual impulse of woman shows greater external passivity.\r\n\r\n2. It is more complicated, less readily arises spontaneously, more\r\nfrequently needs external stimulus, while the orgasm develops more\r\nslowly than in man.\r\n\r\n3. It develops in its full strength only after the commencement of\r\nregular sexual intercourse.\r\n\r\n4. The boundary beyond which sexual excess begins is less easily reached\r\nthan in man.\r\n\r\n5. The sexual sphere has a greater extension, and is more diffusely\r\ndistributed than in man.\r\n\r\n6. The spontaneous appearances of sexual desire have a marked tendency\r\nto periodicity.[31]\r\n\r\n7. The sexual impulse exhibits in woman greater variability, a greater\r\nextent of variation, than in man--alike when we examine separate\r\nfeminine individuals, and when we compare the different phases in the\r\nlife of the same woman.\r\n\r\nThis great extension of the feminine sexual sphere is illustrated, for\r\nexample, by the case reported by Moraglia, of a woman who was able to\r\ninduce sexual excitement by the masturbation of fourteen different areas\r\nof her body.\r\n\r\nHow much more woman is sexuality than man is can be observed in asylums,\r\nwhere the conventional inhibitions are withdrawn. Here, according to\r\nShaw’s observations, the women greatly exceed the men in fluency,\r\nmalignity, and =obscenity=; and in this relation there is no difference\r\nbetween the shameless virago from the most depraved classes of London\r\nand the elegant lady of the upper circles. Noise, uncleanliness, and\r\nsexual depravity in speech and demeanour, are much commoner in the\r\nwomen’s wards of asylums than on the male side. In all forms of acute\r\nmental disorder, according to Shaw, the sexual element plays a much more\r\nprominent part in woman than in man.\r\n\r\nAnother experienced alienist, Dr. E. Bleuler, confirms this permeation\r\nof woman with sexuality. In a recently published work he remarks:\r\n\r\n  “The whole ‘career’ in the average woman depends on sexuality;\r\n  marriage, or some equivalent of marriage, signifies to her what to man\r\n  a position in business signifies--viz., her ambition in all relations,\r\n  the happily conducted struggle for simple existence, as well as for\r\n  pleasure and for all else that life can bring, and only after these,\r\n  sexuality also, and the joy of having children. Not to marry, and also\r\n  extra-conjugal sexual indulgence, induce in woman inevitable\r\n  consequences, with strongly marked emotional colouring; to the average\r\n  man all this is a trifling affair, or it may even be a matter of\r\n  absolute indifference. And we have further to consider the limits\r\n  imposed by our civilization, which make it impossible for the\r\n  well-brought-up woman to live, and even to think, as she pleases in\r\n  sexual matters, and which demand the actual suppression of sexual\r\n  emotions, not merely of the outward manifestation of these emotions.\r\n  Is it to be wondered at that in these circumstances, in mentally\r\n  disordered women, we encounter once more the suppressed sexual\r\n  feelings, those sexual feelings which really comprise at least half of\r\n  our natural existence?--I say =at least= half, for the analogous\r\n  impulse, the nutritive impulse, seems really to be inferior in\r\n  strength to the sexual impulse, in civilized as well as in savage\r\n  human beings.”\r\n\r\nIn the majority of cases the sexual frigidity of woman is, in fact,\r\napparent merely--either because behind the veil prescribed by\r\nconventional morality, behind the apparent coldness, there is concealed\r\nan ardent sexuality, or else because the particular man with whom she\r\nhas had intercourse has not succeeded rightly in awakening her erotic\r\nsensibility, so complicated and so difficult to arouse.[32] When he has\r\nsucceeded in doing so, the sexual insensibility will in the majority of\r\ncases disappear. A striking example of this is seen in the following\r\ncase:\r\n\r\n  =Case of Temporary Sexual Anæsthesia.=--Girl twenty years of age.\r\n  Early awakening of the sexual impulses. Already practised onanism at\r\n  the age of five years; often for the sake of sexual stimulation\r\n  introduced hairpins into the vagina, until one day one of these\r\n  remained, and had to be removed by operation. Notwithstanding this,\r\n  she soon resumed masturbation, using for this purpose a finger, a\r\n  candle, etc. Ultimately this became a daily practice, which she\r\n  continued until she was eighteen years of age. She then first had\r\n  sexual intercourse with a man, in which, however, she remained quite\r\n  cold; this was the case also in subsequent attempts with this man and\r\n  with others. Finally she met a man with whom she was in sympathy, who\r\n  succeeded in inducing in her sexual gratification, by exchange of\r\n  rôles, and corresponding alteration in the position in intercourse.\r\n  Later, intercourse in the normal position also induced complete sexual\r\n  gratification; since then onanism has been entirely discontinued, and\r\n  in coitus the orgasm occurs speedily in one or two minutes.\r\n\r\nWhere sexual frigidity in woman is enduring in character, we have to do\r\neither with inherited influences, with sexual developmental inhibition,\r\nthe psycho-sexual infantilism of Eulenburg, or with some disease\r\n(especially hysteria and other nervous disorders), and with the\r\nconsequences of habitual masturbation.\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, the sexual sensibility of woman is, as we have seen,\r\nof quite a different nature from that of man; but in intensity it is at\r\nleast as great as that of man.\r\n\r\n  [24] The hermaphroditic idea of antiquity has repeatedly fascinated\r\n  the human spirit. It certainly cannot be denied that something great\r\n  and noble underlay this idea of overcoming sex. As long as eighty\r\n  years before, Weininger and the modern apostles of bisexuality, Johann\r\n  Michael Leupoldt, Professor of Medicine at the University of Erlangen,\r\n  made the following prophecy: “_The reconciliation of the sexual\r\n  contrast in every human individual will some day proceed so far_ that,\r\n  dynamically understood, _with the general attainment of a kind of\r\n  hermaphroditism_, humanity, having reached its earthly goal, will\r\n  become totally extinct” (“Eubiotik oder Grundzüge der Kunst, als\r\n  Mensch richtig, tüchtig, wohl und lang zu leben”--“Eubiotics, or\r\n  Principles of the Art of Living as Man Rightly, Virtuously, Well, and\r\n  Long,” pp. 232, 233; Berlin and Leipzig, 1828). This would amount to a\r\n  kind of natural realization of E. von Hartmann’s ideal of conscious\r\n  self-annihilation at the end of time!\r\n\r\n  [25] G. Hirth, “Entropy of the Germinal System and Hereditary\r\n  Enfranchisement,” pp. 89, 90 (Munich, 1900).\r\n\r\n  [26] See note (^{36}), p. 94.\r\n\r\n  [27] The “ulu” is a kind of knife used by Eskimo women.\r\n\r\n  [28] _Cf._ in this connexion, Alice Salomon, “The Choice of a\r\n  Profession for Girls”; Josephine Levy-Rathenau, “A Consideration of\r\n  the Various Professions for Women, Qualifications and Prospects”;\r\n  Elizabeth Altmann-Gottheiner, “A Study of Woman.” These are all\r\n  published in “Das Buch vom Kinde” (“The Book of the Child”), edited by\r\n  Adele Schreiber, Leipzig and Berlin, 1907, vol. ii., Div. 2, pp.\r\n  182-188, 189-209, 210-216 (contains an abstract of the most important\r\n  literature of the subject).\r\n\r\n  [29] On this subject one of our most celebrated economists writes as\r\n  follows: “Let us observe what to-day a good housewife of the middle\r\n  class is able to get through in the way of domestic and hygienic\r\n  activity, and of the education of children, and by means of the\r\n  knowledge and employment of domestic machines; let us not overlook in\r\n  what a one-sided way the great advances in natural science and in the\r\n  mechanical arts have hitherto been devoted to the service of the great\r\n  industries, what enormous economies are still possible if the same\r\n  knowledge and intelligence are devoted to the amelioration of domestic\r\n  service. Only the rough, barbarous housewife of the lower classes can\r\n  say, ‘I have no more to-day to do in the house.’ When the mode of life\r\n  is a healthy one, when to every dwelling-house is attached a garden,\r\n  the housewife even to-day is fully occupied, and in the future will be\r\n  still more so, notwithstanding all the schools that come to her\r\n  assistance, all the shops, all the trades; notwithstanding all the\r\n  products, including food-products, which nowadays she buys ready-made.\r\n  And besides her domestic activity, she has to find time for lectures,\r\n  for culture, for music, and for various socially useful\r\n  activities--even women of quite the lower classes. Without this no\r\n  social cure is possible.”--G. SCHMOLLER, “Elements of General Domestic\r\n  Economy,” vol. i., p. 253 (Leipzig, 1901).\r\n\r\n  THE SIMPLIFICATION OF HOUSEHOLD DUTIES.--English readers will find the\r\n  questions briefly touched upon in this note--the enslavement of woman\r\n  by an unceasing round of petty domestic toil, the necessity for\r\n  devoting the same amount of finished intelligence to these domestic\r\n  problems that has been devoted to “labour-saving” in most departments\r\n  of masculine activity, and the lines on which future progress may be\r\n  expected to move, bringing about in this way alone a much-needed\r\n  “emancipation” of women--fully discussed by Mr. H. G. Wells in his\r\n  sociological studies. See “Anticipations,” “Mankind in the Making,” “A\r\n  New Utopia,” “In the Days of the Comet.”--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n  [30] Noteworthy is the following utterance of a clergyman regarding\r\n  the sensuality of country girls: “Young women are in no way behind\r\n  young men in the strength of their fleshly lusts; they are only too\r\n  willing to be seduced--so =willing= that even older girls frequently\r\n  give themselves to half-grown boys, and =girls give themselves to\r\n  several men in brief succession=. Moreover, it is by no means always\r\n  the young men by whom the seduction is effected. Often enough =it is\r\n  the girls who lure the lads to sexual intercourse=, in which case they\r\n  do not wait till the lads come to their rooms, but they go themselves\r\n  to the young men’s bedrooms, or wait for them in their beds.”--C.\r\n  WAGNER, “The State of Affairs as Regards Sexual Morality among the\r\n  Evangelical Agricultural Population of the German Empire,” vol. i.,\r\n  sec. 2, p. 213 (Leipzig, 1897).\r\n\r\n  [31] E. Heinrich Kisch (“The Sexual Life of Woman,” English\r\n  translation, Rebman, 1908) names the =ovaries= “regulators of the\r\n  sexual impulse.” In the ovary, and in the periodical changes that\r\n  occur in that organ, are to be found the fundamental cause, and the\r\n  means of regulation, of the =sexual impulse=; in the clitoris is the\r\n  seat of =voluptuous sensibility=.\r\n\r\n  [32] Georg Hirth remarks very aptly (“Ways to Love,” Munich, 1906, p.\r\n  570): “For it is the task of the man to summon his whole power of\r\n  self-command, to employ all his skill, to take all the care in his\r\n  power, that the woman may be, as one says, ‘ready.’ The man who thinks\r\n  only of his own gratification, and who leaves his partner ungratified,\r\n  is a brutal being, or, if not brutal, he is simply ignorant of the\r\n  harm he is doing.... In general, the man has the _tempo_ of\r\n  gratification much better and more securely under control than the\r\n  woman; in many women, indeed, the sexual orgasm is very difficult to\r\n  induce, and in such cases the man must help with skill and\r\n  tenderness.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE WAY OF THE SPIRIT IN LOVE--RELIGION AND SEXUALITY\r\n\r\n\r\n“_The more dearly we understand how the indeterminate sexual attractive\r\nforce of the most lowly organisms has, by a continuous addition of\r\npsychical elements, slowly developed into the love of the higher species\r\nof animals and of mankind, the sooner shall we be inclined to attribute\r\nto this sentiment the importance which it deserves. Then we shall no\r\nlonger be able to regard it as an individual imagination, which has no\r\nrelation to reality and no roots in the depths of life. It will become\r\nto us a measuring rule for the stage of evolution to which we have\r\nattained._”--CHARLES ALBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS OF CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n  Influence of the development of the

Ratzel, we understand by civilization the sum total\r\nof all the mental acquirements of a period, then also human love, this\r\nspecific product of civilization, is merely a mirrored picture of the\r\nmental activities of the existing epoch of civilization. We can follow\r\nthis =way of the spirit in love= from the primitive age down to the\r\npresent day, and we can detect, in each successive epoch of\r\ncivilization, the association with sexuality of peculiar spiritual\r\nstates; and after thus passing in review the thousands of years of human\r\nhistory, we can discern once more in our own epoch the individual\r\npsychical elements which characterize the love of modern civilized man.\r\n\r\nThe increasing spiritualization and idealization of sensuality in the\r\ncourse of civilization, =notwithstanding= the persistence of the\r\nelementary intensity of the sexual impulse, is associated with the fact\r\nto which we have already alluded--namely, the preponderance of the brain\r\ncharacteristic of the genus homo--a preponderance which was\r\nunquestionably gradually acquired, and arose in consequence of an\r\naccumulation of original variations which gave their possessors a\r\ncertain advantage in the struggle for existence.\r\n\r\nThus very gradually the primary, instinctive, still powerful animal ego\r\nunderwent expansion into the secondary ego (in Meynert’s sense), into\r\nthe =spiritual personality=, to which a fixed foundation was given by\r\nthe possession of =speech=. With some justice the origin of speech has\r\nbeen singled out as extremely significant for the development of the\r\nfeeling of love; and the conquest of the primitive animal instinct has\r\nbeen, above all, attributed to this faculty. A. Cabral, in his\r\ninteresting work, “La Vénus Génitrix” (Paris, 1882, p. 155), expresses\r\nthe opinion that speech and song developed solely on account of sexual\r\nrelations; and he alludes in support of this view to the well-known\r\nmanifold noises made by various animals in conditions of sexual\r\nexcitement. It is very significant in this connexion that\r\nanthropological science has proved, as an important fact in racial\r\npsychology, that the development of poetry =preceded= that of prose.[33]\r\nThe original form of speech was rhythmical noise, a poem, a song. And\r\nwe saw above that this was subservient to more suggestive purposes, and,\r\nabove all, to sexual allurement. Thus the primitive natural connexion\r\nbetween speech and sexuality appears somewhat probable. With these\r\nearlier erotic noises and alluring tones were subsequently associated\r\nthe first elements of intellectual comprehension, the first =thoughts=.\r\n\r\nThis “withdrawal of mankind from pure instinct,” which Schiller, in his\r\nessay on the earliest human society, describes as the “most fortunate\r\nand most important occurrence in human history,” from which time the\r\nstruggle towards freedom may be said to begin, gradually enabled the\r\nhigher =feeling-tones= of sensation to become more predominant. The\r\nelementary impulses became associated with sensations of pleasure and\r\npain as psychical reactions. The “organic sensations” entered the sphere\r\nof consciousness, and so gave rise, in association and reciprocal\r\nworking with the higher sensory stimuli, to the psychico-emotional roots\r\nof the impulses. Thus, in the sexual sphere, out of pure voluptuousness,\r\nthe simple instinctive impulse towards copulation, arose =love=, whose\r\nessence is an intimate association of physical sensations with feelings\r\nand thoughts, with the entire spiritual and emotional being of\r\nmankind.[34]\r\n\r\n  “Love,” says Charles Albert, “is the result of all the forward steps\r\n  of human activity in all departments, and in every direction, as\r\n  manifested in their effects upon the sexual life. It is an advance\r\n  which goes hand in hand with all other advances. Man is an inseparable\r\n  whole, and in theory only can he be subdivided into separate\r\n  faculties. In reality, indeed, all departments of human development\r\n  are so intimately associated that progress in any one of them must\r\n  place something to the credit of all.”\r\n\r\nIncreasing psychical refinement and differentiation of the human type,\r\ndomination of the intelligence and of emotion over brute force,\r\ntransformation of the social relations between man and woman in\r\nconsequence of economic conditions or of religious and moral ideas,\r\nrespect for personality, a secured provision for the most pressing vital\r\nneeds, and a consequent elevation and complication of the sexual life,\r\nthe influence of a longing for ideal beauty in a psychical and moral\r\nsense--all these and much more have contributed to constitute sexual\r\nlove in the sense in which we understand and experience it at the\r\npresent day. The speech of the lover of our own time is the\r\ncomprehensive expression of all human progress. The difference between\r\nanimal rutting and the lofty sensation of love corresponds exactly to\r\nthe gulf which separates primitive man, capable only of chipping for\r\nhimself a few almost useless flint tools, from civilized man who, with\r\nthe aid of innumerable machines, has tamed to his service the elementary\r\nforces of Nature.\r\n\r\nWe must recur to the earliest beginnings of the evolution of the human\r\npsyche in its association with sexuality, in order to understand the\r\n=profound= and =primitive= connexion between the bodily and the\r\nspiritual formative impulse; this connexion has been expressed by the\r\nsaying that the sexual impulse is the father of all those intellectual\r\nimpulses peculiar to man which have made him a thinker and a discoverer.\r\nIn the time of Schelling’s natural philosophy, they went so far as to\r\nspeak of the “testicular hemispheres” as analogous to the hemispheres of\r\nthe brain. And is not this connexion also expressed etymologically (in\r\nGerman) in the verbal association of _Zeugung_ (procreation) and\r\n_Ueberzeugung_ (certainty, _i.e._, higher, or intellectual,\r\nprocreation), and, further, by the fact that in the Hebrew tongue the\r\nideas of “procreation” and “cognition” are jointly represented by a\r\n=single= term? And, returning to the physical sphere, it may be\r\nmentioned that, according to Moebius (“Ueber die Wirkungen der\r\nKastration”--“Concerning the Effects of Castration,” Halle, 1906),\r\nsexuality is the common product of testicular and cerebral activity.\r\n\r\nPlato was already aware of this relationship when he called thought a\r\nsublimated sexual impulse, and Buffon likewise when he described love as\r\n“le premier essor de la sensibilité, qui se porte ensuite à d’autres\r\nobjets.” In more recent times, Dr. Santlus, in his valuable essay, “On\r\nthe Psychology of the Human Impulses” (_Archiv für Psychiatrie_, 1864,\r\nvol. vi., pp. 244 and 262), alluded to this combination of the sexual\r\nsphere with the highest spiritual interests of mankind under the name of\r\nthe “function-impulse.”\r\n\r\nFrom these intimate relations between sexual and spiritual productivity\r\nis to be explained the remarkable fact that certain spiritual creations\r\nmay take the place of the purely physical sexual impulse; that there are\r\npsychical =sexual equivalents= into which the potential energy of the\r\nsexual impulse may be transformed. Here belong numerous emotions, such\r\nas ferocity, anger, pain, and the productive spiritual activities which\r\nfind their vent in poetry, art, and religion--in short, the whole\r\n=imaginative life= of mankind in the widest sense is able, when the\r\nnatural activity of the sexual impulse is inhibited, to find such sexual\r\nequivalents, the importance of which in the evolutionary history of\r\nhuman love we shall have later to study in further detail.\r\n\r\nInteresting observations regarding this intimate connexion between the\r\nspiritual and the physical procreative impulse are to be found in the\r\nwork of a thinker who made no secret of his intense sensuality, and in\r\nwhose life and thought sexuality played a peculiar part--in the work of\r\nSchopenhauer. In his “New Paralipomena” he lays stress on the similarity\r\nbetween the work of productive genius and the modification of the sexual\r\nimpulse peculiar to the human race. In another place in which, as\r\nFrauenstädt also insists, he is speaking from personal experience, he\r\nwrites: “In the days and hours when the =voluptuous= impulse is most\r\npowerful, not a dull desire, arising from emptiness and dullness of the\r\nconsciousness, but a burning longing, a violent ardour, =precisely then\r\nalso are the highest powers of the spirit available, the finest\r\nconsciousness is prepared for its intensest activity=, although at the\r\nmoment when the consciousness has given itself up to desire they are\r\n=latent=; but it needs merely a powerful effort to turn their direction,\r\nand instead of that tormenting, despairing lust (the kingdom of\r\ndarkness), the activity of the highest spiritual powers fills the\r\nconsciousness (the kingdom of light).”\r\n\r\nGeorg Hirth, who, in the section of his “Ways to Love” entitled\r\n“Stark-naked Thoughts,” gives in aphorisms an interesting account of the\r\npsychology of love, affirms the “delightful phenomenon of a peculiarly\r\nactive enhancement of our impulse to thought and production,” =after=\r\nerotic satisfaction, =after= a fortunate love-night. Very ably, also,\r\nhas Mantegazza described the spiritual activity produced by a happy and\r\nvictorious love.[35]\r\n\r\nMany great thinkers have complained of the alleged impairment of pure\r\nspirituality by the sexual life, and have recommended asceticism in\r\norder to arrive at a truer internal enlightenment. This, however, would\r\nimply pulling up the roots of spiritual poietic[36] activity, the\r\nsuppression of a rich inner life of thought and feeling, the\r\ndestruction of all true poetry and art. There would be left behind only\r\nthe wilderness of a cold abstraction. Look at the letters of Abelard\r\nbefore and after his emasculation. Sexuality first breathes into our\r\nspiritual being the warm and blooming life.\r\n\r\n  “The world,” says Philipp Frey, “would be conceived by us in sharply\r\n  bounded intellectual pictures, unless we saw it in the changing lights\r\n  of our sexuality. From the green of gently dreaming desire, through\r\n  the yellow of surging emotion, and from the blood-red of eager desire\r\n  to the cool blue of satisfaction--all things appear to us in the light\r\n  of our sexuality. Life would be better ordered if we were purely\r\n  intelligible machines for the purposes of nutrition, work, and\r\n  production. But without the dualism of desire and satisfaction, the\r\n  world would become torpid in a great yawn.”\r\n\r\nThis intimate connexion between the psychic-emotional being and the\r\nsexual impulse gave rise to a deepening, a concentration, and an\r\nincreasing intensity, of the feeling of love, whereby the latter becomes\r\nthe most powerful influence affecting mankind in bodily and spiritual\r\nrelations. Voltaire, in his “Pensées Philosophiques,” says aptly:\r\n“L’amour est de toutes les passions la plus forte, parce qu’elle attaque\r\nà la fois la tête, le cœur, et le corps.” That it is in love that the\r\nimmediate admixture of organic processes most clearly manifests itself\r\nis a fact pointed out already by Aristotle, and among modems emphasized\r\nby Griesinger.[37]\r\n\r\nThus love discloses itself as a =nucleus=, the =axis= of the individual,\r\nand therewith also of the social life, a fact indicated already in\r\nSchopenhauer’s phrase, describing love as the “focus of the will,” and\r\nin Weismann’s expression “the continuity of the germ-plasma.” And we can\r\neasily understand that there are literary advocates of a consequent\r\n“=sexual philosophy=,” who base their view of the universe solely and\r\nentirely upon the sexual. To them the sexual problem becomes a world\r\nproblem, eroticism expands into metaphysics. These sexual philosophers\r\nstart from love to unveil the mysteries of life. The most celebrated\r\nadvocate of such a sexual philosophy was the Marquis de Sade, of whom I\r\nhave myself given an account in a pseudonymous work entitled “New\r\nResearches concerning the Marquis de Sade” (Berlin, 1904). According to\r\nde Sade, it is only through the sexual that the world can be grasped and\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nIn a certain sense the antipodes of the Marquis de Sade is a remarkable\r\nsexual philosopher of our own time, the author of “Sex and Character,”\r\nDr. Otto Weininger. His whole circle of thought also revolves\r\nexclusively round the sexual. It forms the basis, the starting-point of\r\nhis exposition; though, indeed, it does so in a purely negative sense.\r\nFor Weininger is the apostle of =asexuality=; to him the highest type of\r\nhuman being is the non-sexual, the one who renounces all sexuality. And\r\nwoman, as the incorporation of sexuality, is to him “nothingness,” the\r\n“radically evil” which must be annihilated.\r\n\r\nA positive sexual philosopher of a nobler kind than these two anomalous\r\nspirits is Max Zeiss, whose book, “Ragnarök, a Philosophico-Social\r\nStudy,” was published at Strasburg in 1904. He regards work, effort,\r\ncreation, the strife for material position, for honour and renown, only\r\nas subordinate aims for the attainment of one aim--=love=.\r\n\r\nThe ever more intimate association of love with the spiritual life, its\r\nincreasing depth, the inclusion within its sphere of influence of all\r\nfeelings and thoughts, necessarily give rise to a stronger development\r\nof the =feeling of individual personality=, which, in contrast with the\r\nearlier instinctive impulse, came more and more to dominate the amatory\r\nlife. Now love gained at least an =equal= importance for the individual\r\nthat in former conditions it had for the purposes of reproduction, and\r\ntherewith subjectively the reproductive idea was unquestionably thrust\r\ninto the background, in comparison with the idea of personal living, of\r\npersonal enrichment and development, by means of love. Hegel says aptly\r\n(“Æsthetics,” Berlin, 1837, vol. ii., p. 186): “The sorrows of love,\r\nthese frustrate hopes, the very state of being in love, the never-ending\r\npains which the lover actually experiences, this never-ending happiness\r\nand joy to which he looks forward in imagination--these are matters\r\ndevoid of all general interest; =they concern only the lover himself=.”\r\nSchleiermacher also insists, in his letters concerning “Lucinde,” on the\r\ngreat importance of love for the spiritual development of the\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nThe individualization of love has certainly resulted in a great decline\r\nin the predominance of the reproductive idea, of the subjective sense of\r\nrace, without it ever being possible for it to lose its eminent\r\n=objective= significance. Nietzsche, therefore, declares a\r\n“reproductive impulse” to be pure “mythology;”[38] and Carpenter, also,\r\nin his book, “Love’s Coming of Age,” says that human love is mainly a\r\ndesire for complete union, and only in much less degree a wish for the\r\nreproduction of the race. The profound significance of individual love\r\nin the =promotion of civilization= is exceedingly well described by him\r\nwhen he says:\r\n\r\n  “Taking union as the main point, we may look upon the idealized\r\n  sex-love as a sense of contact pervading the whole mind and\r\n  body--while the sex-organs are a specialization of this faculty of\r\n  union in the outermost sphere: union in the bodily sphere giving rise\r\n  to bodily generation, the same as union in the mental and emotional\r\n  spheres occasions generation of another kind.”\r\n\r\nProof of the fact that love, in its purely individual relations, is also\r\nof great importance for human civilization, that it is profoundly\r\nsignificant for the higher evolution of humanity, =in addition to= its\r\nimportance for the perpetuation of the species--the proof of this thesis\r\nis very important in view of certain problems connected with the theory\r\nof population and in view of the practical conclusions deduced from that\r\ntheory, as, for example, the doctrine of neo-malthusianism. =Love and\r\nlove’s embrace do not exist only for the purposes of the species: they\r\nare also of importance to the ego; they are necessary for the life, the\r\nevolution, and the internal growth of the individual himself.=\r\n\r\nAnd we must not fail to recognize to what extent the fact that the\r\nindividual has gained much from love ultimately reacts also to the\r\nadvantage of the species. For the species, as well as for the\r\nindividual, the true path of progress lies in the direction of the\r\nindividualization of the sexual impulses.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen we study in detail the gradual permeation of sexuality with\r\nspiritual elements, the gradual development of love, and its advance\r\ntowards perfection by means of civilization, we ascertain that for the\r\nlove of the modern civilized man there exists a kind of biogenetic, or\r\nrather psychogenetic, fundamental law. In modern love we encounter all\r\nthe spiritual elements which were actively operative in the love of past\r\ntimes; the love of the civilized man of the present day is an extracted,\r\nshortened, compressed repetition of the entire developmental course of\r\nlove from the earliest times to the present day. And the general course\r\nof this development reappears also in the love of the individual.\r\n\r\nThis course is, to put the matter shortly, from the general to\r\nthe individual, from the remote to the proximate. We can further\r\ndivide the history of human love into two great epochs. In the first\r\nepoch, love was, above all, a =transcendental relationship= of a\r\nreligio-metaphysical nature. The transcendental relationships played a\r\nmore important part than the purely human and personal. Everywhere an\r\nulterior element played its part. In the second epoch, love underwent an\r\nevolution into a more =personal= relationship, in which the human being\r\nhimself took foremost place, as compared with any transcendental\r\nconsiderations. The history of love is, in fact, an illustration of\r\nCompte’s replacement of the theologico-metaphysical epoch of mental\r\ndevelopment by the anthropological. In individual love, however, there\r\nstill remain active and demonstrable many transcendental elements. The\r\noldest spiritual elements of love continue to form a portion of the\r\ncontent of modern love, and to play a more or less dominant part in its\r\ngenesis.\r\n\r\nTo this primeval and psychical phenomenon belongs, above all, an\r\nintimate association between =religious= ideas and feelings and the\r\nsexual life. In a certain sense, the history of religion can be regarded\r\nas the history of a peculiar mode of manifestation of the human sexual\r\nimpulse, especially in its influence on the imagination and its\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nCertain modern writers, members of the laity far from learned in the\r\nhistory of civilization, have considered the Roman Catholic Church\r\npre-eminently responsible for the appearance of this sexual element in\r\nritual and dogma. This, however, is grossly unjust. A =scientific= study\r\nof these relations teaches us that =all= religions exhibit to a greater\r\nor less degree this sexual admixture, and if this appears more prominent\r\nin the Roman Catholic Church, it is due, in the first place, to the fact\r\nthat this religion is nearer to us in time than many of the religions of\r\nantiquity, and, in the second place, it is explicable on the ground that\r\nthe Roman Catholic Church has always displayed greater openness and less\r\nhypocrisy than, for example, the Protestant pietists, who, as the\r\nKönigsberg scandal, the Eva van Buttler affair, etc., show, are no less\r\nblameworthy in respect of sexual vagaries.\r\n\r\nA really =objective= basis for an opinion regarding the relations\r\nbetween religion and sexuality can only be obtained when we cease to\r\nconsider these relations as an affair of dogma and of the confessional,\r\nand study them upon the basis to which they properly belong--to wit, the\r\n=anthropological=. For these relationships are peculiar to the genus\r\nhomo as such. The sexual element is quite as prominent in the religions\r\nof primitive peoples as in those of modern civilized nations.\r\n\r\nAnthropological science has hitherto been occupied more with the fact\r\nthan with the explanation of the remarkable relations between religion\r\nand sexuality. There can, however, be no doubt that these relations\r\narise out of the very nature of mankind. The various anthropologists and\r\nphysicians who have occupied themselves with these problems are in\r\nagreement upon this point: that the connexion between religion and the\r\nsexual life can be explained only on =anthropomorphic-animistic=\r\ngrounds--that is, by the same kind of ideas which Tylor has proved to be\r\nthe foundation of the primitive mental life.\r\n\r\nThus, the great physician and anthropologist Theodor Billroth doubts the\r\nexistence of any pure religious perception entirely free from all\r\nsensual elements. In a letter to Hanslick, dated February 21, 1891, he\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n  “In my opinion, it is nonsensical to speak of a special religious\r\n  perception. What we call by this name is either a purely fanciful and\r\n  imaginative opinion, which may rise to the intensity of hallucination,\r\n  and has for substratum any kind of imaginative product which excites a\r\n  yearning in the believing or loving individual--or else, in fanatics,\r\n  it is an actual erotic excitement, like the rhythmical\r\n  prayer-movements of the Mohammedans, the dancing of the Dervishes, or\r\n  the jumping of the Flagellants. The Church as bridegroom for the nun,\r\n  as bride for the monk, has a similar signification. It is, in a\r\n  certain sense, the continuation of the service of Isis, and of the\r\n  festivals of Aphrodite and Bacchus. Man has always created his gods or\r\n  his god in his own image, and prays and sings to him--that is,\r\n  properly speaking, to himself--in the artistic forms of the period.\r\n  Since the so-called divine is always a mere abstraction or\r\n  personification of one or several human attributes in the highest\r\n  conceivable potency, it follows that human and divine, worldly and\r\n  religious, cannot really be of differing natures. Man cannot, in fact,\r\n  think anything supernatural, nor can he do anything unnatural, because\r\n  he never can think or act except with human attributes.”\r\n\r\nThis explanation coincides with the view of Ludwig Feuerbach, who has\r\nespecially insisted on the anthropomorphistic element in religio-sexual\r\nphenomena in his essay “Concerning Mariolatry.”\r\n\r\nM’Lennan and Tylor were among the chief discoverers of the animistic\r\naspect of religio-sexual ideas. In a way analogous to his attitude\r\ntowards other phenomena, primitive man assumed the activity of spirits\r\nin explanation of the sexual impulse and everything associated\r\ntherewith; and he paid divine worship to the sexual impulse, as the\r\nvisible and palpable manifestation of those spirits.\r\n\r\nI myself have more fully described this physiological process in a\r\nsomewhat different manner (“Contributions to the Etiology of\r\nPsychopathia Sexualis,” vol. i., pp. 76, 77), and I quote here my\r\naccount of the primitive deification of the sexual.\r\n\r\nAs something elemental, incredible, supernatural, the sexual impulse\r\nmade its appearance in man’s life at the time of puberty; by its\r\noverwhelming force, by the intensity, spontaneity, and multiplicity, of\r\nthe perceptions to which it gave rise, it awakened feelings which\r\nenriched, vivified, and inflamed the imagination in an unexpected\r\nmanner. This phenomenon, overwhelming him with elemental force, filled\r\nprimitive man with a holy fear. He ascribed it to a supernatural\r\ninfluence, =and this supernatural influence became associated in his\r\ncircle of perceptions with those others which he had previously\r\nexperienced=, and which had aroused in him the feeling of =dependence\r\nupon one or several higher powers=, before which he knelt in worship. To\r\nwhat an extent the =metaphysical= invaded the whole sexual life of man,\r\nSchopenhauer has clearly shown in his “Metaphysic of Sexual Love.”\r\nReligion and sexuality come into the most intimate association in this\r\nperception of the metaphysical and in this feeling of dependence; hence\r\narise the remarkable relations between the two, and that easy transition\r\nof religious feelings into sexual feelings which is manifest in all the\r\nrelations of life. In both cases the surrender, the renunciation, of the\r\nindividual personality is experienced as a pleasurable sensation.\r\nSchopenhauer has described in a classical manner the metaphysical\r\nimpulsive force of love striving onward towards the infinite and the\r\ndivine, whose analogy with the religious impulse we cannot fail to\r\nrecognize.\r\n\r\nIn his thoughtful book, “The Vital Laws of Civilization” (Halle, 1904,\r\np. 52), Eduard von Mayer has also discussed the religio-sexual problem.\r\nHe starts from the idea that man regarded as higher than himself that\r\nwhich he was unable to master, and, above all, hunger and love.\r\n\r\n  “The pains of ungratified hunger or love plough deep furrows, into\r\n  which falls the seed of voluptuousness, of satisfied hunger, or of the\r\n  joys of love. And to primitive man, to whom the entire universe is\r\n  full of living beings, hunger and love also appear as =divine powers=,\r\n  which pain and plague him until their will is satisfied.”\r\n\r\nThe association of sexuality with religion affects both sexes equally,\r\nalthough the phenomenon appears more intense in woman, and is more\r\nenduring in her, owing to the greater depth of her emotional life. The\r\nbrothers de Goncourt, in their diary, describe religion as simply a\r\nportion of woman’s sexual life. Feminine sexual activity thus appears\r\nsomething religious, pious, holy. And those priests who pretended to\r\n“sanctify” by their love the women whom they seduced, were certainly\r\nmore accurate, from the =physiological= point of view, than the Church\r\nwas in its condemnation of carnal lust as sin and the work of the devil.\r\nIn the middle ages it was a view commonly held in France that women who\r\nhad intercourse with priests were in some sort sanctified thereby. The\r\nmistresses of priests were called the “consecrated.”\r\n\r\nThe identity of religious and sexual perceptions explains the frequent\r\ntransformation of one into the other, and the continuous association\r\nbetween the two. A sexual emotion will often function vicariously for a\r\nreligious emotion, in part or wholly.\r\n\r\nThe unusually interesting history of the complicated and remarkable\r\nreligio-sexual phenomena renders clear to us individual processes of\r\nthis kind and certain peculiarities of racial psychology; and thereby we\r\nare led to understand the powerful after-effects of these phenomena in\r\nthe customs, the morals, and the conventions of our time, and we are\r\nenlightened as to the rôle still played by the religio-sexual factor in\r\nthe life of many men even of our own day.\r\n\r\nOne of the oldest, if not the oldest, of religio-sexual phenomena is\r\n=religious prostitution=--the “lust-sacrifice,” as Eduard von Mayer\r\nhappily expresses it--since therein the sexual act is regarded as a\r\nsacrifice made to the deity. We have here the unrestricted offering by a\r\nwoman of her body to every chance comer without love, =as an act of\r\nsimple sensuality, and for payment=, and thus we find all the\r\ncharacteristics of what at the present day we term “prostitution.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the researches I have myself previously published regarding\r\nreligious prostitution, this may be divided into two great groups:\r\n\r\n1. =A single act of prostitution in honour of the deity.=\r\n\r\n2. =Permanent religious prostitution.=\r\n\r\nA single act of religious prostitution mostly consists in the offering\r\nof virginity; sometimes also in the single, not repeated, offering of an\r\nalready deflowered woman. In the single act of religious prostitution,\r\nthe woman either offers herself =directly to the deity=, the bodily act\r\nof defloration being effected by a divine physical symbol--as, for\r\ninstance, by a penis made of stone, ivory, or wood--or by direct\r\nintercourse with the statue of the god; or else the woman gives herself\r\nto a =human representative= of the deity--for instance, to the king, to\r\na priest, to a blood-relative (not seldom to her own father, this being\r\na variety of religious incest), and sometimes to a passing stranger.[39]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the first mode of defloration, by means of a divine\r\nsymbol, we have especially full reports from the East Indies. Here, in\r\nthe sixteenth century, in the Southern Deccan, the Portuguese Duarte\r\nBarbosa first saw the religious defloration of girls effected by means\r\nof the “lingam,” the divine phallus. Girls aged ten years only were\r\nsacrificed to the deity in this brutal manner. From a later time come\r\nthe accounts of Jan Huygen van Linschoten and Gasparo Balbi, regarding\r\nthe customs of the inhabitants of Goa. The bride was taken into the\r\ntemple, where a penis of iron or ivory was thrust into the vagina, so\r\nthat the hymen was destroyed. In other cases, the girl’s genitals were\r\nbrought into contact with the stone penis of an image of the god, at a\r\nshrine eighteen miles distant from Goa. W. Schultze, in his “East Indian\r\nJourney” (Amsterdam, 1676, p. 161_a_), relates:\r\n\r\n  “By means of this priapus, with the assistance of friends and\r\n  relatives, the maiden was deprived of her virginity with force and in\r\n  a painful manner; at the same time the bridegroom rejoiced that the\r\n  foul and accursed idol had done him this honour, in the hope that as a\r\n  result of this sacrifice he would enjoy greater happiness in his\r\n  marriage.”\r\n\r\nThis process of defloration of Indian virgins by the lingam idol is\r\nconfirmed by the reports of John Fryer, Roe, Jeon Moquet, Abbé Guyon,\r\nDémeunier, and others.\r\n\r\nThe god Baal Peor, worshipped by the Moabites and Jews, seems also to\r\nhave possessed such a divine power of defloration. His name, “Peor,” “to\r\nopen,” is supposed to relate to the destruction of the hymen.[40]\r\n\r\nThis relationship is more distinctly expressed in the names of certain\r\ngods of the ancient Romans, such as Dea Perfica, Dea Pertunda, Mutunus\r\nTutunus, regarding whose functions in connexion with defloration, shown\r\nunquestionably by the etymology of their names, I have referred to at\r\ngreater length in my essay on “Ancient Roman Medicine” (published in\r\nPuschmann’s “Handbook of the History of Medicine,” p. 407; Jena, 1902).\r\n\r\nFor the honour of the sexual divinities, the bride was compelled, as\r\nAugustine, Lactantius, and Arnobius report, to seat herself upon the\r\n“fascinum”--that is, the _membrum virile_ of the priapus statue--and in\r\nthis way, either physically, or at least symbolically, sacrifice her\r\nvirginity to the deity. According to the legend, the conception of\r\nOcrisia was actually effected in this way![41]\r\n\r\nAccording to the second method by which single acts of religious\r\nprostitution are effected, a representative of the deity exercises the\r\nlatter’s right of defloration. It is a form of religious _jus primæ\r\nnoctis_, which is given to the king, the priest, the father, and, above\r\nall, to a casual stranger, before the girl becomes the property of her\r\nhusband or master. In cases in which the husband has effected\r\ndefloration, the deity may be satisfied by the woman later giving\r\nherself once to his representative.\r\n\r\nThe best-known form of religious prostitution is the Mylittacult of the\r\nBabylonians, the worship of that goddess who, according to Bachofen,\r\nrepresents the uncontrolled life of Nature in its fullest creative\r\nactivity, unchecked by any man-made laws--the goddess whose free nature\r\nis opposed to the constraining bonds of marriage. For this reason the\r\ngoddess, as representative of the unrestrained nature principle, demands\r\nfrom every girl a free gift of herself to any man wishing to have\r\nintercourse with her. This demand is made in the name of Mylitta and in\r\nthe temple devoted to her. The money paid by the man in return for his\r\nsexual indulgence belongs to the goddess, and is added to the treasures\r\nof the temple.[42]\r\n\r\nHerodotus and Strabo give us additional accounts of this remarkable\r\nservice of Mylitta. Women of rank, as well as those of the lower\r\nclasses, must allow themselves to be possessed once by a stranger, and\r\nwere not permitted to return home until they had given their tribute to\r\nthe goddess. Moreover, the woman might not refuse herself to any\r\nstranger, whilst the man, on the other hand, had a free choice. Thus in\r\nthis account we find all the characteristics of “prostitution” according\r\nto our present ideas.\r\n\r\nThis custom was abolished by the Emperor Constantine, as Eusebius\r\ninforms us, in his biography of this Emperor. The accounts of Strabo and\r\nof Quintus Curtius show us that it had persisted from the time of\r\nHerodotus to the time of Constantine; in Cyprus, Phœnicia, Carthage,\r\nJudea, Armenia, and Lokris, the Mylittacult was diffused.[43]\r\n\r\nThe true origin of this cult was a consecration to the deity, a tribute\r\nto the goddess of voluptuousness. Secondarily only, other elements may\r\nhave entered into the practice, as, for instance, the later widely\r\ndiffused assumption of the uncleanness and poisonous properties of the\r\nblood which was shed in the act of defloration. At the same time the\r\nreligious idea of a “sacrifice” may have become associated with the idea\r\nof “self-surrender” to an utterly strange and unloved man, so that it is\r\npossible that at the root of this peculiar custom there lay a kind of\r\nmasochism on the part of the woman, whilst we cannot fail to recognize\r\nthe existence of a sadistic basis in the demeanour of the betrothed man\r\nor husband, surrendering the woman to a strange man; both of these\r\nelements--sadism and masochism--having here a religious signification.\r\n\r\nIn Eastern Asia, and among many savage races, priests played the part of\r\nrepresentatives of the deity to whom the defloration of the girls and\r\nthe newly-married was assigned; for instance, in the Indian sect of the\r\n“Mahārājas,” founded by Vallabha, in which “=immorality was elevated to\r\nthe level of a divine law=.”[44]\r\n\r\nThese “great kings” assumed the part of deities who had an unlimited\r\nright of possession over the wives of the faithful--above all, the right\r\nof defloration. They proclaimed as the most perfect mode of honouring\r\nthe god a complete surrender of the woman to the spiritual chief of the\r\nsect, for purposes of carnal lust--in exact imitation of the\r\nshepherdesses (“gopis”), the mistresses of the god Krishna. This took\r\nplace during the pastoral games “rasmandali” in the autumn.[45] In\r\naddition, on account of his activity as deflorator, the priest received\r\na present in the name of the deity. Abel Rémusat reports in his\r\n“Nouveaux Mélanges Asiatiques” (Paris, 1824, vol. i., p. 16 _et seq._),\r\nfollowing the account of a Chinese author of the thirteenth century, the\r\npeculiar methods employed in Cambodia for the purpose of religious\r\ndefloration. Here the priests of Buddha or the priests of the Tao\r\nreligion were carried in sedan-chairs to the girls awaiting them. Each\r\ngirl had a candle with a mark on it. The “tshin-than” (= adjustment of\r\nposture--that is, sexual intercourse) must be finished before the candle\r\nhad burnt down to this mark!\r\n\r\nThe medicine-men and wizards among the Caribs of Central and South\r\nAmerica, the “piaches” or “pajes,” had to effect the defloration of the\r\nyoung girls;[46] whilst among other primitive peoples this right was\r\nassigned to the chiefs.[47]\r\n\r\nThe talented and far-seeing Bachofen, one of the greatest of our\r\ninvestigators into the history and psychology of civilization, in his\r\nclassical works upon “Matriarchy” and upon “The Legend of Tanaquil,” has\r\nvery cleverly pointed out that religious prostitution in general arises\r\nfrom the primitive =opposition= to the individualization of love,\r\ninstinctively felt by primitive peoples. In fact, in the religious view\r\nof sexual matters more value is placed upon the act than the person, the\r\nindividual. Hence arises the slight esteem--so strongly opposed to our\r\nmodern view--felt for physical and moral virginity in woman, which to us\r\n(whether rightly or not we will not now discuss) appears the symbol of\r\nfeminine individuality. Waitz, Bachofen, Kulischer, Post, Ploss-Bartels,\r\nRottmann, and other ethnologists, give additional accounts of the\r\ncontempt, to us so remarkable, felt in primitive states for the virgin\r\nwoman. The tragi-comic position of our own “old maids” is closely\r\nconnected with this primeval sentiment.[48]\r\n\r\nThe facts we have just given regarding single acts of religious\r\nprostitution will pave the way for the understanding of =permanent\r\ntemple prostitution= as a historical phenomenon.\r\n\r\nSexual self-surrender as a purely sensual act is associated with\r\nreligious feeling. Thus in some cases a woman would experience a\r\ncombination of ardent sensuality with intense religious feeling, would\r\ndevote herself wholly to the service of the god, and in his name would\r\npermanently surrender her body; whilst in other cases the idea of a\r\ndivine harem--in Indian belief every god has a harem--would find its\r\nearthly exemplar in temple prostitution, by means of which the deity\r\nwould enjoy a number of women through the intermediation of men; or,\r\nfinally, this custom would arise out of the primitive practice,\r\naccording to which sexual intercourse, regarded as a religious act,\r\n=customarily= took place in a temple, or in some consecrated room of a\r\nhouse. In support of this view, we may quote a significant utterance\r\nfrom Herodotus (chapter lxiv. of the second book of his “History”), who\r\nin ethnological matters had such accurate discrimination. He reports\r\nthat among the Egyptians intercourse was strictly forbidden in the\r\ntemples, and then says:\r\n\r\n  “For people of all nations, except the Egyptians and the Hellenes, are\r\n  accustomed to copulate in holy places, and proceed after intercourse\r\n  unwashed into the holy places; and they are of opinion that men\r\n  resemble animals, and every one sees beasts and birds copulating in\r\n  the temples of the gods, and in the consecrated groves. Now, =if this\r\n  were displeasing to the gods, the animals would not do it=. Men,\r\n  therefore, do this, and give this reason for it.”\r\n\r\nThis custom arose, without doubt, from the need for a religious\r\nsentiment, and from the wish to enter into direct communion with the\r\ndeity, by remaining in the temple during the sexual act. When later the\r\ndivine beings obtained their own consecrated women in the form of the\r\n=temple-girls=, it was no longer necessary for a man to take his own\r\nwife or some other woman into the temple, for now communion with the\r\ndeity could be obtained by means of intercourse with the temple-girls.\r\nIn the case of =feminine= deities a fourth cause or influence comes into\r\noperation in the production of temple prostitution, inasmuch as the\r\ncourtesans, on account of their extreme beauty and their remarkable\r\nintellectual powers, were often regarded as representatives of the\r\ngoddess. This explains how it happened that among the Greeks beautiful\r\nhetairae served as models for Praxiteles and Apelles, when these\r\nsculptors were making statues for the temple.\r\n\r\nThe sacred priests of Venus, the “kade-girls” of the Phœnicians, and the\r\n“hierodules” of the Greeks, were the servants of Aphrodite, and dwelt\r\nwithin the precincts of the temple. Their number was often very great.\r\nThus in Corinth more than 1,000 female hierodules prostituted themselves\r\nin the precincts of the temple of Aphrodite Porne, and even within the\r\ntemple.[49]\r\n\r\nIndia, where the primitive phenomena of the amatory life can best be\r\nstudied, is also the favourite seat of temple prostitution, since the\r\nreligious view of the sexual life is nowhere so prominent as in the\r\nIndian beliefs.[50] The temple girls of India are known as\r\n“nautch-girls,” or “nautch-women.” Warneck writes regarding them:\r\n\r\n  “Every Hindu temple of any importance possesses an arsenal of\r\n  =nautch-girls=--that is, dancing-girls--who, next to the sacrificial\r\n  priests, are the most highly respected among the personnel of the\r\n  temple. It is not long since these temple-girls (just like the\r\n  hetairae of Ancient Greece) were among the only educated women in\r\n  India. These =priestesses, betrothed to the gods= from early\r\n  childhood, were under the professional obligation to prostitute\r\n  themselves to every one without distinction of caste. This\r\n  self-surrender is so far from being regarded as a disgrace that even\r\n  the most =highly placed= families regarded it as an honour to devote\r\n  their daughters to the service of the temple. In the Madras Presidency\r\n  alone there are about 12,000 of these temple prostitutes.”[51]\r\n\r\nShortt gives further interesting details of these temple prostitutes,\r\nwho are also known as “thassee.”\r\n\r\nReligious prostitution is to a certain extent still practised in\r\nSouthern Borneo; and in a newspaper published at Amsterdam--_The German\r\nWeekly News of the Netherlands_--the following account of the practice\r\nappears in the issue of July 30, 1907:\r\n\r\n  “In the Dyak country there are to be found in nearly every _kampong_\r\n  (village) individuals known as ‘balians’ and ‘basirs.’ The balians are\r\n  prostitutes who also perform medical services. The basirs are men who\r\n  dress in women’s clothing, and in other respects perform the same\r\n  functions as the balians, but not all the basirs act in this way.\r\n  Balians and basirs are also commonly employed to perform certain\r\n  religious ceremonies, on festal occasions, at marriages, funerals,\r\n  births, etc. According to the nature of the festivity, five to fifteen\r\n  of them officiate. The president of the balians and basirs goes by the\r\n  name of the ‘upu’; usually the oldest and most experienced is chosen\r\n  for this office. The upu sits in the middle, with the others to right\r\n  and left. At an important festival the upu receives from twenty to\r\n  thirty gulden; the others one to fifteen gulden. The further away that\r\n  a balian sits from the upu, the smaller is her honorarium; the\r\n  honorarium is called ‘laluh.’ The principal balians and basirs are\r\n  known as ‘bawimait maninjan sangjang’--that is, ‘holy women.’ At the\r\n  present time the basirs no longer exercise the immoral portions of\r\n  their duties, because the Government inflicts severe penalties if they\r\n  do so; moreover, they are not allowed now to appear in public in\r\n  women’s clothing.”\r\n\r\nReligion shares with the sexual impulse the unceasing yearning, the\r\nsentiment of everlastingness, the mystic absorption into the depths of\r\nlife, the longing for the coalescence of individualities in an eternally\r\nblessed union, free from earthly fetters. Hence the longing for death\r\nfelt by lovers and by mystically enraptured pietists, which has been so\r\nwonderfully described by Leopardi. “The yearning for death felt by\r\nlovers is identical with the yearning for sexual union,” aptly remarks\r\nH. Swoboda, and he very rightly points out that many a suicide ascribed\r\nto “unfortunate love” is rather the result of a happy love.\r\n\r\nAmong primitive peoples, and in ancient times, =religio-erotic\r\nfestivals= first gave an opportunity for the manifestation of this\r\nreligio-sexual mysticism. In this the transition of religious ecstasy\r\ninto sexual perceptions is very clearly visible, and in the sexual\r\norgies in which these religious frenzies often found an appropriate\r\nfinale we see the crudest expression of the relationship between\r\nreligion and sexuality. In such cases sexual ardour appears to be\r\nequivalent to a =prolongation= and an =increase= of the religious\r\nardour--fundamentally, radically coincident, as the natural earthly\r\ndischarge of an ecstatic tension directed to the sphere of the remote\r\nand the metaphysical.\r\n\r\nThe fact that such sexual excesses are =throughout the world= found in\r\nassociation with religion, that since the very earliest times they have\r\nbeen connected with the =most various forms= of religion, proves once\r\nmore that the origin of this relationship is dependent on the very\r\nnature of religion as such, and that it is =not in any way= due to the\r\nindividual historic character of any one belief. It is, moreover, quite\r\nuncritical and altogether without justification for any modern writer to\r\nendeavour to make Roman Catholicism responsible for such an association;\r\nRoman Catholicism as such has as little to do with the matter as all\r\nother beliefs. Religio-sexual phenomena belong to the everywhere\r\nrecurring =elementary ideas= of the human race (elementary ideas in the\r\nsense of Bastian); and the only way of regarding such phenomena that can\r\nbe considered scientifically sound, is from the anthropological and\r\nethnological standpoint.\r\n\r\nThis sexual religious mysticism meets us everywhere--in the religious\r\nfestivals of antiquity, the festivals of Isis in Egypt, and the\r\nfestivals of imperial Rome, both alike accompanied by the wildest sexual\r\norgies; in the festivals of Baal Peor, among the Jews, in the Venus and\r\nAdonis festivals of the Phœnicians, in Cyprus and Byblos, in the\r\nAphrodisian, the Dionysian, and the Eleusinian festivals of the\r\nHellenes; in the festival of Flora in Rome, in which prostitutes ran\r\nabout naked; in the Roman Bacchanalia; and in the festival of the _bona\r\ndea_, the wild sexual licence of which is only too clearly presented to\r\nour eyes in the celebrated account of Juvenal.\r\n\r\nIn India, the sect of Caitanya, founded in the sixteenth century,\r\ncelebrated the maddest religio-sexual orgies. Their ritual consisted\r\nprincipally of long litanies and hymns, stuffed full with unbridled\r\neroticism, and followed by wild dances, all leading up to the sexual\r\nculmination, in which “the love of God” (_bhakti_) was to be made as\r\nclearly perceptible as possible.[52] Even worse were the Sakta sects\r\n(the name is derived from _sakti_, force--that is, the sensuous\r\nmanifestation of the god Siva). They gave themselves up with ardent\r\nsensuality to the service of the female emanations of Siva, all\r\ndistinctions of caste being ignored, and wild sensual promiscuity\r\nprevailing. Divine service always preceded the act of sexual\r\nintercourse.\r\n\r\nAmong the Kauchiluas, one of these Sakta sects, each of the women who\r\ntook part in these divine services threw a small ornament into a box\r\nkept by the priests. After the termination of the religious festival,\r\neach male member of the congregation took one of these articles out of\r\nthe box, whereupon the possessor of the article must give herself to him\r\nin the subsequent unbridled sexual excesses, even if the two should\r\nhappen to be brother and sister.[53]\r\n\r\nAncient Central and South America were also familiar with wild outbreaks\r\nof a sexual-religious character. In Guatemala, on the days of the great\r\nsacrifices, there occurred sexual orgies of the worst kind, men having\r\nintercourse promiscuously with mothers, sisters, daughters, children,\r\nand concubines; and at the “Akhataymita festivals” of the ancient\r\nPeruvians, the religious observances terminated in a race between\r\ncompletely nude men and women, in which each man overtaking a woman\r\nimmediately had sexual intercourse with her.[54]\r\n\r\nSexual mysticism found its way also into Christianity. When the renowned\r\ntheologian Usener, in his work “Mythology,” writes in relation to these\r\nmatters, “the whole of paganism found its way into Christianity,” we\r\nmust point out that in our view what “corrupted” Christianity was not\r\n“paganism,” but the =fundamental phenomena of primitive human nature=,\r\nthe primordial connexion between religion and sexuality, which by a\r\nnatural necessity manifested itself in Christianity not less than in\r\nother religions.\r\n\r\n=Thus down to the present day= we encounter the most peculiar\r\nmanifestations of sexual mysticism in the most diverse Christian sects,\r\nand not merely in Roman Catholicism.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth century of our era, the Jewish-Christian sect of the\r\nSarabaïtes concluded their religious festivals with wild sexual orgies,\r\nwhich are graphically described by Cassianus. This sect persisted into\r\nthe ninth century. The later history of the Christian sects is full of\r\nthis religio-sexual element. Religious and sexual ardour take one\r\nanother’s place, pass one into the other, mutually =increase= one\r\nanother. I need merely allude to certain points familiar in the history\r\nof civilization, and investigated and described by many recent students:\r\nthe religio-erotic orgiastic festivals of the Nicolaitans, the Adamites,\r\nthe Valesians, the Carpocratians, the Epiphanians, the Cainites, and the\r\nManichæans. Dixon, in his “Spiritual Wives” (2 vols., London, 1868), has\r\ndescribed the sexual excesses of recent Protestant sects, such as the\r\n“Mucker” of Königsberg, the “Erweckten” (“the awakened”), the Foxian\r\nspiritualists of Hydesville, etc. Widely known also is the peculiar\r\nassociation between sexuality and religion in Mormonism, polygamy being\r\namong the Mormons a religious ordinance.\r\n\r\nNot only do Roman Catholicism and Protestantism exhibit such phenomena,\r\nbut in the Greek Church also sexual mysticism gives rise to the most\r\nremarkable offshoots. Leroy-Beaulieu gives an account of the Russian\r\nsect of the “Skakuny,” or “Jumpers,” who at their nocturnal assemblies\r\nthrow themselves into a state of erotic religious ecstasy by hopping and\r\njumping, like the dancing Dervishes of Islam. When the frenzy reaches a\r\nclimax, a shameless, utterly promiscuous union of the sexes occurs, of\r\nwhich incest is a common feature.[55]\r\n\r\nQuite apart from these sectarian peculiarities, religio-sexual\r\nperceptions play a definite part in the ideas of present-day, truly\r\npious Christians. The idea of a “unio mystica” between man and the Deity\r\nmanifests itself everywhere.[56]\r\n\r\nAlbrecht Dieterich, in his learned work, “A Mithraist Liturgy,”\r\ncontributes valuable material to the history of civilization concerning\r\nthese mystical unions. The oldest heathen cults were familiar with the\r\nidea of love unions as a representation of the union of man with God;\r\nand in the New Testament the ideas of the bridegroom and the marriage\r\nfeast play a leading part. Christ is the “bridegroom” of the Church, the\r\nChurch is His “bride.” Pious maidens and nuns are happy to call\r\nthemselves the brides of Christ. This ecstatic union has always as its\r\nsubstratum a sexual imagination. Augustine says: “Like a bridegroom\r\nChrist leaves His bridal chamber; in the mood of a bridegroom He\r\nbestrides the field of the world.”\r\n\r\nThe literature, the theology, the visions, and the plastic art of the\r\nmiddle ages abound in embellishments of the mystical marriage. St.\r\nCatherine of Siena and St. Theresa were favourite objects of this form\r\nof art. The baroque artist Bernini, in his representation of St.\r\nTheresa, in the Church Santa Maria della Vittoria in Rome, has painted a\r\ntruly modern “alcove scene,” so that a mocking Frenchman, President de\r\nBrosses, said, speaking of this picture, “Ah, if that is divine love, I\r\nknow all about it.”\r\n\r\nOn October 8, 1900, when Crescentia Höss, of Kaufbeuren, was canonized\r\nin the Peterskirche, a picture was exhibited in which was depicted the\r\nmystical union between the new saint and the Redeemer. To the picture\r\nwas attached a Latin inscription signifying, “Our Lord Jesus Christ\r\npresents to the virgin Crescentia, in the presence of the most holy\r\nMother of God and of Crescentia’s guardian angel as groomsman, the\r\nmarriage ring, and weds her.” The novice about to become a nun appears\r\nbefore the altar dressed as a bride, in order to wed herself eternally\r\nto Christ; and in the life of the common people we find an even more\r\nrealistic view is taken of this mystical marriage. A celibate priesthood\r\nappears to the peasant, notwithstanding all the respect that he has for\r\nthe clerical vocation, as something strange and incomprehensible; he\r\nregards the “primiz,” the first mass of the newly ordained priest, as a\r\nmarriage which the most reverend priest celebrates with the Church, and\r\nfor this purpose the Church is represented by a young girl. This is at\r\nthe present day still a popular custom in Baden, Bavaria, and the Tyrol.\r\nIn this ceremony, which does not lack a poetic aspect--it is admirably\r\ndescribed by F. P. Piger in the _Zeitschrift des Vereins für\r\nVolkskunde_, 1899--the peasants who are present make the coarsest and\r\nmost pointed jokes, and as soon as the celebration is finished, they\r\nwithdraw, in the company of the “holy” bride, to a public-house, where\r\n“they need not be embarrassed by the presence of the reverend priest.”\r\n\r\nThe intimate association between sexuality and religion in these\r\nmystical unions and marriages has been shown by Ludwig Feuerbach in his\r\ntreatise, “Ueber den Marienkultus” (“On Mariolatry”), Complete Works,\r\nLeipzig, 1846, vol. i., pp. 181-199. A very interesting instance of this\r\nis also afforded by the following religious poem, which appears in a\r\npoetical devotional work, at one time very widely diffused among the\r\nfeminine population of France (“Les Perles de Saint François de Sales,\r\nou les plus belles Pensées du Bienheureux sur l’Amour de Dieu,” Paris,\r\n1871):\r\n\r\n   “Vive Jésus, vive sa force,\r\n    Vive son agréable amorce!\r\n    Vive Jésus, quand sa bonté\r\n    Me reduit dans la nudité;\r\n    Vive Jésus, quand il m’appelle:\r\n    Ma sœur, ma colombe, ma belle!\r\n\r\n    Vive Jésus en tous mes pas,\r\n    Vivent ses amoureux appas!\r\n    Vive Jésus, lorsque sa bouche\r\n    D’un baiser amoureux me touche!\r\n\r\n    Vive Jésus quand ses blandices\r\n    Me comblent de chastes délices!\r\n    Vive Jésus lorsque à mon aise\r\n    Il me permet que je la baise!”\r\n\r\n  [“Praise to Jesus, praise His power,\r\n    Praise His sweet allurements!\r\n    Praise to Jesus, when His goodness\r\n    Reduces me to nakedness;\r\n    Praise to Jesus when He says to me:\r\n    ‘My sister, My dove, My beautiful one!’\r\n\r\n   “Praise to Jesus in all my steps,\r\n    Praise to His amorous charms!\r\n    Praise to Jesus, when His mouth\r\n    Touches mine in a loving kiss!\r\n\r\n   “Praise to Jesus when His gentle caresses\r\n    Overwhelm me with chaste joys!\r\n    Praise to Jesus when at my leisure\r\n    He allows me to kiss Him!”]\r\n\r\nIn addition to religious prostitution and to sexual mysticism, two other\r\nreligious manifestations show an intimate relationship with the sexual\r\nlife, are, indeed, in part of sexual origin--namely, =asceticism= and\r\nthe =belief in witchcraft=.\r\n\r\nNeither of these is, as has often been maintained by superficial\r\nwriters, peculiar to the Christian faith. As Nietzsche says, Eros did\r\nnot poison Christianity alone; asceticism and the belief in witchcraft\r\nare =common anthropological conceptions, met with throughout the history\r\nof civilization=, and arising from the primitive ardour of religious\r\nperceptions.\r\n\r\nTo what degree is the high estimation of asceticism--that is, the view\r\nthat earthly and eternal salvation are to be found in =complete sexual\r\nabstinence=--associated with the religious sentiment? Religion is the\r\nyearning after an ideal, a belief in a process of perfectibility. To\r\nsuch a belief the sexual impulse and everything connected with it must\r\nappear as the greatest possible hindrance to the realization of the\r\nideal, because nowhere else is the =disharmony= of existence so plainly\r\nmanifest as in the sexual life.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth chapter of his work on “The Nature of Man,” Metchnikoff has\r\ncollected all the numerous disharmonies of the reproductive organs and\r\nthe reproductive functions, in consequence of which the modern man,\r\nbecome self-conscious, suffers so severely. Among these disharmonious\r\nphenomena in social life, Metchnikoff enumerates, _inter alia_, the\r\ntroublesome, painful, and unæsthetic menstrual hæmorrhage in women,\r\nwhich all primitive peoples regarded as something unclean and evil; the\r\npains of childbirth; the asynchronism between puberty and the general\r\nmaturity of the organism, the latter occurring much later than the\r\nformer, and thus giving rise to temporal inequalities of development in\r\ndifferent parts of the sexual functions, causing, for example,\r\nmasturbation actually before the development of spermatozoa; the long\r\ninterval that commonly elapses between the onset of sexual maturity and\r\nthe conclusion of marriage; the numerous disharmonious phenomena\r\noccurring in connexion with the decline of reproductive activity at a\r\nlater stage of life, when marked specific excitability and sexual\r\nsensibility often persist after the capacity for sexual intercourse has\r\nbeen lost; and finally the disharmonies in sexual intercourse between\r\nman and woman.\r\n\r\nAccording to Metchnikoff, this disharmony of the sexual life, from the\r\nearliest to the most advanced age, is the source of so many evils, that\r\nalmost all religions have harshly judged and severely condemned the\r\nsexual functions, and have recommended abstinence from coitus as the\r\nbest means for the harmonious and ideal regulation of life.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, we have to take into consideration the opposition\r\nbetween spirit and matter, deeply realized already by primitive man. The\r\nsexual, as the most intense and most sensuous expression of material\r\nexistence, was opposed to the spiritual, and was regarded as an unclean\r\nelement, which must be fought, overcome, and, when possible, utterly\r\nuprooted, in favour of the spiritual life. In one of the most ancient of\r\nmythologies the first recorded instance of the gratification of sexual\r\ndesire resulted in excluding man for ever from “Paradise”--in excluding\r\nhim, that is to say, from the highest kind of spiritual existence. The\r\nprincipal psychological characteristic of asceticism is therefore to be\r\nfound, not only in the vow of poverty, but, in addition, and even more,\r\nis it found in =sexual abstinence=, in the battle against the “flesh”\r\n(“caro,” to the fathers of the early Church, always denoted the genital\r\norgans).\r\n\r\nWhat is, however, the inevitable consequence of this continual battle\r\nwith the sexual impulse? Weininger expressed the opinion (“Sex and\r\nCharacter,” p. 469, second edition; Vienna, 1904): “The renunciation of\r\nsexuality =kills= only the =physical= man, and kills him only in order,\r\nfor the first time, to ensure the complete existence of the spiritual\r\nman”; but this is =entirely false=, and proceeds from an extremely\r\ndeficient knowledge of human nature. For the “renunciation of sexuality”\r\nis, in truth, the most unsuitable way of securing a complete existence\r\nfor the spiritual man. Just as little will it annihilate the physical\r\nman. For he who wishes to overcome and cast out the sexual impulse\r\n(powerful in every normal man, and at times overwhelming in its\r\nstrength) =must keep the subject constantly before his eyes, for ever in\r\nhis thoughts=. Thus it came to pass that the ascetic was actually more\r\noccupied with the subject of the sexual impulse than is the case with\r\nthe normal man. This was favoured all the more by the ascetic’s\r\nvoluntary =flight from the world=, by his continuous life in solitude--a\r\nlife favourable to the production of hallucinations and visions, and one\r\nwhich becomes tolerable only by a sort of natural reaction in the form\r\nof a luxuriance of imaginative sensuality. For\r\n\r\n  “Nous naissons, nous vivons pour la société:\r\n   A nous-mêmes livrés dans une solitude,\r\n   Notre bonheur bientôt fait notre inquiétude.”\r\n\r\n  (Boileau, Satire X.)\r\n\r\n  [“We are born, we live for society:\r\n    Given up to ourselves in solitude,\r\n    Our happiness is speedily replaced by restlessness.”]\r\n\r\nThis “inquiétude,” this intensification of the nervous life in all\r\nrelations, was especially noticeable in the sexual sphere. Visions of a\r\nsexual character, erotic temptations, mortifications of the flesh in the\r\nform of self-flagellation, self-emasculation and mutilations of the\r\ngenital organs, are characteristic =ascetic= phenomena. On the other\r\nhand, the excessive valuation and glorification of the pure spiritual\r\nled not only to the view that matter was something in its nature sinful\r\nand base, =but also led directly to sexual excesses=, for many ascetic\r\nsects declared that what happened to the already sinful body was a\r\nmatter of indifference, that every contamination of the body was\r\npermissible. Hence is to be explained the remarkable fact of the\r\noccurrence of =natural and unnatural unchastity in numerous ascetic\r\nsects=.\r\n\r\nSexual mortification and sexual excesses--these are the two poles\r\nbetween which the life of the ascetic oscillates, so that we see in each\r\ncase a marked sexual intermixture. Asceticism is, therefore, often\r\nmerely the means by which sexual enjoyment is obtained in another form\r\nand in a more intense degree.\r\n\r\n=Asceticism is as old as human religion, and as widely diffused\r\nthroughout the entire world.= We find individual ascetics among many\r\nsavage peoples; ascetic sects, especially among the ancient and modern\r\ncivilized races, in Babylon, Syria, Phrygia, Judæa, even in\r\npre-Columbian Mexico, and most developed in India, in Islam, and in\r\nChristianity.\r\n\r\nThe Indian samkhya-doctrine, demanding increased self-discipline,\r\n“yoga,” which was based upon the opposition between spirit and matter,\r\nled to the adoption of asceticism in Buddhism and in the religion of the\r\nJains, also to the foundation of ascetic sects, such as the “Acelakas,”\r\nthe “Ajivakas,” the “Suthrēs” or “Pure,” who, according to Hardy, “are\r\nin their life a disgrace to their name.” Yogahood attained its highest\r\ndevelopment among Sivaitic sects of the ninth to the sixteenth\r\ncenturies; these alternated between uncontrolled satisfaction of the\r\nrudest sexual impulses and asceticism pushed to the point of\r\nself-torture.\r\n\r\nIn Islam it was the sect of the Sufi in which the relation between\r\nsexuality and asceticism was especially manifest; but before this\r\nChristianity had developed asceticism into a formal system, and had\r\ndeduced its most extreme consequences. To the early Christians, only the\r\nnutritive impulse appeared natural; the sexual impulse was debased\r\nnature; physical and psychical emasculation were actually recommended in\r\nthe New Testament writings (_cf._ Matt. xix. 12). Already in the second\r\ncentury of the Christian era numerous Christians voluntarily castrated\r\nthemselves, and in the fourth century the Council of Nicæa found it\r\nnecessary to deal with the prevalence of this ascetic abuse, and with\r\nthe predecessors of the modern “skopzen.”[57]\r\n\r\nNumerous ascetics and saints withdrew into solitude in order to attain\r\nsalvation by castigation of the body. But it is very noteworthy that\r\nthey almost all =lived and moved exclusively in the sexual=, and that,\r\nin the way already explained, they came to occupy themselves incessantly\r\nwith all the problems of the sexual life.\r\n\r\nThe writings of the saints are full of such references to the _vita\r\nsexualis_, and are, therefore, a valuable source for the history of\r\nancient morals. Nothing was so interesting to these ascetics as the life\r\nof prostitutes and the sexual excesses of the impious. Numerous legends\r\nrelate the attempts of the saints to induce prostitutes to abandon their\r\nprofession, and to turn to a holy life, and the work of Charles de\r\nBussy, “Les Courtisanes Saintes,” shows the result of these labours. St.\r\nVitalius visited the brothels every night, to give the women money in\r\norder that they might not sin, and prayed for their conversion.\r\n\r\nThus, in the case of the ascetics, whose thoughts were continually\r\noccupied with sexual matters, the sole result of their castigation,\r\nself-torture, and emasculation, was to lead their sexual life ever wider\r\nastray into morbid and perverse paths. The monstrous =sexual visions= of\r\nthe saints reflect in a typical manner the incredible violence of the\r\nsexual perceptions of the ascetics. To use the words of Augustine, how\r\nfar were these unhappy beings from the “serene clearness of love,” how\r\nnear were they to the “obscurity of sensual lust!” These visions, these\r\n“false pictures,” allured the “sleepers” to something to which, indeed,\r\nin the awakening state they could not have been misled (Augustine,\r\n“Confessions,” x. 30). The forms of beautiful naked women (with whom,\r\nmoreover, the ascetics often really lay in bed in order to test their\r\npowers) appeared to them in dreams. Fetichistic and symbolic vision of\r\nan erotic nature pestered them, and led to the most violent sensual\r\ntemptations, until in the sects of the Valesians, the Marcionites, and\r\nthe Gnostics they resulted in sexual excesses. Marcion, the founder of\r\nthe well-known sect named after him, preached continence, but maintained\r\nthat sexual excesses could not hinder salvation, since it was only the\r\nsoul that rose again after death! The Gnostics oscillated between\r\nunconditional celibacy and indiscriminate sexual indulgence. As late as\r\nthe nineteenth century an ascetic mystic led the Protestant sect of\r\nKönigsberg pietists into the grossest sensual excesses.\r\n\r\nFrom asceticism arose =monasticism= and the =cloistral life=, to which\r\nthe considerations above given fully apply. The undeniable unchastity\r\nof the medieval cloisters, which found its most characteristic\r\nexpression in denoting brothels by the name of “abbeys,” and, above all,\r\nin popular songs and in folk-tales, also shows us very clearly the\r\nrelations between religious asceticism and the _vita sexualis_.\r\n\r\nThe idea of asceticism has not lost its primitive force even at the\r\npresent day, and retains it for certain men not under the influence of\r\nthe Church. But the character and origin of this =modern asceticism= are\r\ndifferent. We understand it when we remind ourselves of the saying of\r\nOtto Weininger, this typical adherent of “modern” asceticism, that the\r\nman who has the worst opinion of woman is not the one who has least to\r\ndo with them, but rather the one who has had the greatest number of\r\n_bonnes fortunes_ (“Sex and Character,” p. 315).\r\n\r\nThe ascetics of early Christianity first denied sexuality--for\r\nexample, by self-castration, or by flight into solitude--in order\r\nsubsequently to affirm it the more strongly. Our modern _fin-de-siècle_\r\nascetics, above all, the three most successful literary apostles of\r\nasceticism--Schopenhauer, Tolstoi, and Weininger--at first affirmed\r\ntheir sexuality most intensely, in order subsequently to deny it in the\r\nmost fundamental manner. They studied voluptuousness, not merely in the\r\nideal, but also in reality. For this reason, also, they have furnished\r\nus with more valuable conclusions regarding its nature and its\r\nsignificance in the life of individual men than we can obtain from the\r\nvisions of the early Christian ascetics. This is true above all of\r\nSchopenhauer and Tolstoi.\r\n\r\nSchopenhauer had first to endure in his own person the whole tragedy of\r\nvoluptuousness, to experience the elemental force of the sexual impulse,\r\nthe “enmity” of love (see his own account given to Challemel-Lacour),\r\nbefore he proceeded to grasp the full significance of the ascetic idea.\r\nHis asceticism is intimately associated with his sensuality, and with\r\nthe consequences of its activity. I believe that I have myself recently\r\nfurnished a striking proof of this fact by the publication of a hitherto\r\nunknown holograph manuscript of the philosopher,[58] by which it is\r\nclearly established that he had suffered from syphilitic infection. In\r\nthis connexion we find the explanation of the close relationship which\r\nSchopenhauer himself postulated between the “wonderful venereal disease”\r\nand asceticism. From his own utterances regarding syphilis, and, above\r\nall, from the fact that he himself had suffered from the disease, we are\r\nable to grasp the significance that syphilis had in the conception of\r\nhis ascetic views, which were developed under the immediate influence of\r\nhis experiences, sorrows, and passions; whereas in old age, when the\r\nelemental force of the sexual impulse, and the unhappy consequence of\r\nyielding to it, no longer troubled him, there appeared in his thought a\r\ndistinctly happier colouring.\r\n\r\nTolstoi also recognizes without reserve how much he had been affected by\r\nvoluptuousness. “I know,” he says, “how lust hides everything, how it\r\nannihilates everything, by which the heart and the reason are\r\nnourished.” Lack of continence on the part of men is, in his view, the\r\ncause of the stupidity of life. Tolstoi’s conception of asceticism is,\r\nhowever, by no means identical with the early Christian, the Buddhistic,\r\nand the Schopenhauerian asceticism. In the beautiful saying, “Only with\r\nwoman can one lose purity, only with her can one preserve it,” lies the\r\nadmission that =absolute= chastity is an unattainable ideal, and that\r\nman can reach only a =relative asceticism=. We should hold fast to this\r\nutterance in Tolstoi’s teaching, which is in no way systematically\r\ndeveloped, and should ignore his insane doctrine of the unchastity of\r\nmarried life. Later, during our discussion of the so-called “problem of\r\ncontinence,” we shall return to this idea of a relative continence, and\r\nof the good that lies therein.\r\n\r\nWeininger, whose views are unquestionably strongly pathological, recurs\r\nwholly to the ideas of early Christian asceticism. According to him,\r\n“coitus in every case contradicts the idea of humanity”! Sexuality\r\ndebases man, reproduction and fertility are “=nauseating=.”[59] Man is\r\nnot free, only because he has originated in an immoral manner! In woman\r\nhe denies again and again the idea of humanity. The renunciation, the\r\nconquest of femininity, it is this that he demands. =Since all\r\nfemininity is immorality, woman must cease to be woman, and must become\r\nman!=[60]\r\n\r\nGeorg Hirth has described Weininger’s book as “an unparalleled crime\r\nagainst humanity.”[61] Since, however, Probst, in his psychiatric study\r\nof Weininger, has brought forward evidence to show that in Weininger’s\r\nbook we have to do with the work of a lunatic, the author of this crime\r\ncannot at any rate be held responsible. It is only to be regretted that\r\nso many readers have been led astray by the presence of isolated\r\nthoughtful passages in the book to take Weininger in earnest as a\r\n“thinker,” and even in company with the bizarre August Strindberg to\r\nbelieve that Weininger has solved “the most difficult of all problems”!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVery significant and influential even down to the present day are the\r\nrelations between religion and sexual sentiments exhibited in the\r\n=belief in witchcraft=.[62] This belief, extending backwards to the most\r\nremote age, is the principal source of all misogyny and contempt for\r\nwomen--of which fact we cannot too often remind our modern misogynists,\r\nin order to make clear to them the utter stupidity, the primitiveness,\r\nand the atavistic character of their views.\r\n\r\nHere, again, we must first show the falsity of the view that the belief\r\nin witches is a specifically Christian experience. To the diffusion of\r\nthis error the celebrated work of J. Michelet, “La Sorcière,” has\r\nespecially contributed, for in this book the witch is represented as a\r\nChristian medieval discovery. But the Christian religion, as such, is as\r\nlittle blameworthy for this belief as are all the other confessions of\r\nfaith. =The belief in witches, with its religio-sexual basis, is a\r\nprimitive general anthropological phenomenon=, a fixture, a part of\r\nprimitive human history arising from the primeval relations between\r\nreligious magic and the sexual life.\r\n\r\n  “When we look deeply into the province of psychology,” says G. H. von\r\n  Schubert, “we not only suspect, but recognize with great certainty,\r\n  that there exists a secret combination between the activities of the\r\n  animal carnal sexual impulse and the receptivity of human nature for\r\n  magical manifestations.\r\n\r\n  “We stand here in the depths of the abyss in which the lust of the\r\n  flesh becomes inflamed to the lust of hell, and in which the flesh,\r\n  with all its indwelling forces of sin and death, celebrated its\r\n  greatest triumph over the spirit appointed by God to command the\r\n  flesh.”[63]\r\n\r\nThe animism of primitive man, and of savage man at the present day, sees\r\nin all frightful natural phenomena shaking his innermost being to its\r\nfoundation the manifestation and action of demons and sorcerers. The\r\nrutting impulse also, which attracts primitive man to woman, appears to\r\nhim to be due to the influence of a demon, =and soon woman herself came\r\nto seem to man something uncanny, something magical=. Thus, in its\r\norigin the belief in witchcraft arises from the =sexual impulse=, and\r\n=throughout its history sorcery in all its forms remained associated\r\nwith the sexual impulse=.\r\n\r\nThis sexual origin of the belief in witches and in magic has been\r\ncarefully described by the celebrated ethnologist K. Fr. Ph. von\r\nMartius, on the basis of his observations amongst the indigens of\r\nCentral Brazil. “=All sorcery arises from rutting=,” said an old Indian\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nMagic propagates itself by means of sexual desire, and, according to\r\nMartius, will predominate among primitive peoples as long as these\r\n=remain unchaste=.[64] Secret arts, voluptuousness, and unnatural vice\r\nare inseparable one from another. This is proved by the entire history\r\nof human civilization and morals. Among the indigens of Brazil, the\r\n“pajé” or “piache,” the sorcerer or medicine-man, plays the same part as\r\nthe medieval or Christian witch.\r\n\r\nSorcerers and witches are, above all, experienced in the sexual\r\nprovince; popular belief always turns first to this subject. The witches\r\nof ancient Rome resemble those of the middle ages in respect of their\r\nevil practices in sexual relations. According to J. Frank, the word\r\n“hexe” (witch) is derived from “hagat”--that is, “vagabond woman.” The\r\nascetic view of the middle ages, formulated principally by men, saw in\r\nwoman one who seduced man to sensual, sinful lust, the personification\r\nof the Evil One, the “janua diaboli,” and, ultimately, a female demon\r\nand a witch, whose very being is an impersonation of the obscene and the\r\nsexual. The doctrines of Original Sin and of the Immaculate Conception\r\nhad unquestionably an important share in this conception of woman.\r\n\r\nThe idea of woman as a witch turned almost exclusively on the sexual,\r\nand the witch was for the most part represented as a “=mistress of the\r\ndevil=” (_cf._ W. G. Soldan, “History of Witch-Trials,” pp. 147-159;\r\nStuttgart, 1843), in which sexual perversion plays the principal part,\r\nsince, instead of simple sexual intercourse, the most horrible unnatural\r\nvice was assumed to occur.\r\n\r\nHolzinger, in his valuable lecture on the “Natural History of Witches,”\r\ncharacterized the spiritual and moral condition of the time, which\r\nbrought forth such an idea, in a few apt words:\r\n\r\n  “Whilst in the fifteenth and the beginning of the sixteenth centuries,\r\n  as those well acquainted with the state of morals during this period\r\n  can all confirm, a most unbounded freedom was dominant in sexual\r\n  relations, the State and the Church were desirous of compelling the\r\n  people to keep better order by the use of actual force, and by\r\n  religious compulsion. So forced a transformation in so vital a matter\r\n  necessarily resulted in a reaction of the worst kind, and forced into\r\n  secret channels the impulse which it had attempted to suppress. This\r\n  reaction occurred, moreover, with an elemental force. There resulted\r\n  widespread sexual violence and seduction, hesitating at nothing, often\r\n  insanely daring, in which everywhere the devil was supposed to help;\r\n  every one’s head was turned in this way, the uncontrolled lust of\r\n  debauchees found vent in secret bacchanalian associations and orgies,\r\n  wherein many, with or without masquerade, played the part of Satan;\r\n  shameful deeds were perpetrated by excited women and by procuresses\r\n  and prostitutes ready for any kind of immoral abomination; add to\r\n  these sexual orgies the most widely diffused web of a completely\r\n  developed theory of witchcraft, and the systematic strengthening by\r\n  the clergy of the widely prevalent belief in the devil--all these\r\n  things woven in a labyrinthine connexion, made it possible for\r\n  thousands upon thousands to be murdered by a disordered justice and to\r\n  be sacrificed to delusion.”\r\n\r\nThe study of the witch-trials of the middle ages and of recent\r\ntimes--for it is well known that in the seventies of the nineteenth\r\ncentury (!) such trials still occurred[65]--would without doubt afford\r\nvaluable contributions to the doctrine of psychopathia sexualis, and at\r\nthe same time would throw a remarkable light upon the origin of sexual\r\naberrations.\r\n\r\nWhat a large amount of sexual abnormality arises even to-day from this\r\ncommon, human, obscure, superstitious impulse dependent upon the\r\nintermixture of religious mysticism and sexual desire, and which in the\r\nmedieval belief in witches attained such astonishing development!\r\n\r\nAs Michelet proved in his great work on “Sorcery,” it was =the religious\r\nimagination straying into sexual by-paths=, which for the most part\r\nanimated the belief in witchcraft, and thus led to the most horrible\r\naberrations, principally of a sadistic nature.\r\n\r\nLike superstition, so also the sexual-religious obsession of the middle\r\nages, still persists in many persons, =even at the present day=, and\r\ngives rise to sexual anomalies.\r\n\r\nApart from asceticism and the belief in witchcraft, theological\r\nliterature offers numerous instances of the relationship between\r\nreligion and sexuality.\r\n\r\nIn an essay published six years ago,[66] I showed the important part\r\nwhich sexual questions have played in the so-called =pastoral\r\nmedicine=--that is to say, in those theological writings in which the\r\nindividual facts and problems of medicine are studied from the\r\ntheological standpoint, and their relation to dogma is determined. We\r\nfind here theological casuistry carried to its extreme limits, in\r\nrelation to all possible problems of the _vita sexualis_. The\r\nexperiences of the confessional are employed in a remarkable manner, the\r\nreligious imagination wandering, in a peculiar combination of\r\nscholasticism and sensuality, in the obscure fields of human aberration.\r\n\r\nThe =ostensible= inducement to the theological consideration of sexual\r\nproblems is in part offered by the statements of perverse individuals in\r\nthe confessional, and in part by public scandals. In both cases\r\ncasuistry endeavours, from the religious standpoint, to formulate\r\ncertain normal rules for the judgment of the various matters relating to\r\nthe sexual life. This would, however, have been impossible, had there\r\nnot existed an intimate connexion between sexuality and religion.\r\n\r\nOnly in this way is it possible to explain the origin of the gigantic\r\n=literature of sexual casuistry= in theology, and especially in pastoral\r\nmedicine. A comprehension of these facts has led certain writers to\r\nlaunch bitter invectives against the system of which the confessional\r\nformed so essential a part. This is a narrow and prejudiced view, which\r\nwe mention only to condemn. There is, however, ample justification for\r\nthe representations of =physicians= and =anthropologists=, who are able\r\nto observe matters in the great connexion sketched above, and who have\r\nrecognized the relations between religion and the sexual life to be\r\nsomething common to all humanity, not the artificial products of any\r\nparticular spiritual tendency. It is precisely the frequent endeavours\r\nof the Catholic Church to overcome the worst outgrowths in this\r\ndirection, which teach us, notwithstanding their failure to eradicate\r\nsexual aberrations, that these relationships depend upon the very nature\r\nof religion.\r\n\r\nThere is not a single sexual problem which has not been discussed in\r\nthe most subtle manner by the theological casuists,[67] so that their\r\nwritings offer us a most instructive picture of =imaginative activity=\r\nin the sexual sphere.\r\n\r\nThe most detailed discussion, verging on the salacious, of the degree to\r\nwhich sexual contact is permissible, gave rise to the name “theologiens\r\nmammillaires,” because some of them--Benzi, for example, and\r\nRousselot--sanctioned “tatti mammillari” (mammillary palpation). This\r\ndoctrine was condemned by Pope Benedict XIV., which proves that the\r\nCatholic Church as such has not invariably sanctioned these things.\r\n\r\nIn the “Golden Key” (“Llave de Oro”) of Antonio Maria Claret, the\r\nArchbishop of Cuba, in Debreyne’s “Moechialogie,” in the writings on\r\nmoral theology of Liguori, Dens, and J. C. Saettler, in the\r\n“Diaconales,” widely diffused in France, and in many similar works, all\r\npossible sexual problems which have come before the confessional, or\r\npossibly =might= come there, have been thoroughly discussed--even the\r\nmost improbable and impossible. Coitus interruptus, irrigatio vaginæ\r\npost coitum, pollutions (nocturnal seminal emissions), bestiality,\r\nnecrophilia, figuræ Veneris (positions in which coitus is effected),\r\nprocuration, various kinds of caresses, conjugal onanism, abortion,\r\nvarieties of masturbation, pæderasty, intercourse with a statue (!),\r\npsychical onanism, pædication, etc.--all have been subjected to a subtle\r\ncritical theological analysis. In a sense, these writings are really\r\nvaluable mines for the study of psychopathia sexualis. Later we shall\r\nhave frequently to touch on the religious etiology of the individual\r\nsexual aberrations.\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding discussion it appears quite clearly that the\r\nrelations between religion and the _vita sexualis_ are to be regarded as\r\ngeneral anthropological phenomena, and not as peculiarities arising by\r\nchance, the accidental results of beliefs, time, or race. The modern\r\nphysician, jurist, and criminal anthropologist must therefore pay the\r\nmost careful attention to the religious factor in the normal and\r\nabnormal sexual life of mankind, if he wishes to arrive at an\r\nunprejudiced and undisturbed knowledge of sexual anomalies. Havelock\r\nEllis has also laid stress on the leading significance of religious\r\nsexual perceptions. He proved that small oscillations of erotic feelings\r\naccompany all religious perceptions, and that in some circumstances the\r\nerotic feelings overwhelm the religious perceptions.[68] We still meet\r\nwith sexual excesses under the cloak of religion, as occurred recently\r\n(1905) in Holland, and (1901) in England. In the English instance young\r\ngirls were initiated into the most horrible forms of unchastity in the\r\nreligious association founded by the American Horos and his wife, and\r\nknown by the name of “Theocratic Unity.”[69]\r\n\r\nFriedrich Schlegel, as Rudolf von Gottschall remarks, proclaimed in his\r\n“Lucinde” the new evangel of the future, in which voluptuousness--as\r\nduring the time of Astarte--is to form a part of religious ritual. The\r\nreawakened tendency of our own day towards romantic modes of perception\r\nwould certainly seem to involve the danger of a renewal and\r\nstrengthening of religio-sexual ideas.\r\n\r\nFor as long as the feelings of love carry with them an inexpressible,\r\noverwhelming force, like that of religious perceptions, the intimate\r\nassociation between religion and sexuality will persist both in a good\r\nand a bad sense. An elderly physician, who in his interesting book\r\ndetailed the experiences derived from forty years of practice,[70] made\r\nvery apposite remarks regarding this religious sexualism. According to\r\nhim, unbounded piety is “often no more than a sexual symptom,”\r\nproceeding from =deprivation of love or satiety of love=, the latter\r\nreminding us of the saying “Young whore, old devotee.” Moreover, this is\r\ntrue alike of man and woman. Piety dependent upon deprivation of love\r\ncan often be cured by “castor, cold douches, or a well-arranged marriage\r\nwith a robust, energetic man,” who drives away for ever the “heavenly\r\nbridegroom.”[71]\r\n\r\nThe religious perception is a completely =general= yearning, and the\r\nsame is the case with the associated sexual feelings. The boundless\r\neverlasting impulsion which both contain does not admit of any\r\nindividualization. For this reason, the religio-sexual perceptions can\r\nplay only a subordinate part in the individual love of the future; they\r\nconstitute only the first step in the history of the idealization of the\r\nsexual impulse, and of its spiritualization to form love.\r\n\r\nIn the romance “Scipio Cicala,” by Rehfues, the Neapolitan abbess calls\r\nout “=I love love=,” after she has gone through the enumeration of all\r\nthe phases of passionate love towards God. The modern man, however, says\r\nto the woman, and the woman says to the man, “=I love you=”; the general\r\nreligious love has capitulated to the individual love.\r\n\r\nThis is clearly the direction taken by “the way of the spirit” in love,\r\nwhich we shall now pursue further.\r\n\r\n  [33] _Cf_. F. von Andrian, “Some Results of Modern Ethnology,” in\r\n  “Correspondenzblatt der deutschen Gesellschaft für Anthropologie,\r\n  Ethnologie, und Urgeschichte” (1894, No. 8, p. 71).\r\n\r\n  [34] “Love,” in the sense above defined, is peculiar to mankind, and\r\n  for this reason we must, as Ploss-Bartels also insists, admit its\r\n  existence in human beings at the very lowest levels of civilization.\r\n  There it is, indeed, no more than “a faintly glimmering, easily\r\n  extinguished spark,” while among civilized peoples it has become “a\r\n  bright, widely diffused flame.”\r\n\r\n  [35] Regarding the connexion between sexuality and spiritual activity,\r\n  see also Virey, “Recherches médico-philosophiques sur la Nature et les\r\n  Facultés de l’Homme” (Paris, 1817, p. 39).\r\n\r\n  [36] For the apt and convenient word _poietic_, in preference to\r\n  _creative_ or _productive_, I have to thank Mr. H. G. Wells. See his\r\n  most admirable “A Modern Utopia,” and on p. 265 _et seq._ his\r\n  brilliant classification of “four main classes of mind--the Poietic,\r\n  the Kinetic, the Dull, and the Base.”... “The Poietic or creative\r\n  class of mental individuality embraces a wide range of types,” but, he\r\n  goes on to say, the two principal varieties of the _poietic_ type are\r\n  those classified as _artistic_ and _scientific_ natures respectively.\r\n  It is the quality by which these two natures are distinguished from\r\n  the kinetic and the dull to which Mr. Wells gives the name of\r\n  “poietic,” and it is precisely this quality whose interconnexion with\r\n  the sexual life is insisted on in the text by Dr. Bloch and by the\r\n  authors from whom he quotes.--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n  [37] _Cf._ W. Griesinger, “Mental Disorders,” third edition\r\n  (Brunswick, 1871, p. 7).\r\n\r\n  [38] Rudolf Topp speaks of a “degeneration” of the “healthy natural\r\n  reproductive impulse” into the “sexual impulse.” In the primeval\r\n  period of human history, he maintains, man knew and gratified the\r\n  reproductive impulse only; the sexual impulse developed gradually, and\r\n  in a later stage of the evolutionary history of mankind, out of the\r\n  reproductive impulse, and, in fact, is a degeneration (!) of the\r\n  latter. In this period we may look for the first beginnings of\r\n  functional impotence, on account of the too frequent exercise of the\r\n  sexual function. _Cf._ R. Topp, “On the Therapeutic Use of Yohimbin\r\n  ‘Riedel’ as an Aphrodisiac, with Especial Reference to Functional\r\n  Impotence in the Male,” published in the _Allgemeine Medizinische\r\n  Central-Zeitung_, 1906, No. 10.\r\n\r\n  [39] From this fact we may draw the conclusion that the so-called\r\n  _hospitable prostitution_ is only a variety of religious prostitution.\r\n\r\n  [40] J.

=sense of shame=. Recent researches have for the first time\r\nestablished the fact that the sense of shame is not innate in man, but\r\nthat it is =a specific product of civilization=--that is to say, a\r\nmental phenomenon arising in the course of progressive evolution, and as\r\nsuch is peculiar to man--present already, indeed, in the naked man, but,\r\nabove all, characteristic of the =clothed= man. Clothing and the sense\r\nof shame have developed proportionally side by side, and in dependence\r\neach on the other; and originally both subserved the same purpose, to\r\ndevelop more strongly, and to bring to expression the individual,\r\npersonal, peculiar nature of the individual man. They mirror the first\r\nindividual activities in the amatory life of primitive man.\r\n\r\nGeorg Simmel has recognized very clearly this individualizing influence\r\nof the sense of shame by saying: “The entire sense of shame depends upon\r\nthe self-uplifting of the individual.”[72]\r\n\r\nBy means of the recent critical investigations of leading\r\nanthropologists and ethnologists, we have obtained most important\r\nconclusions regarding the erotic sense of shame. Above all worthy of\r\nmention are the clear-sighted investigations of Havelock Ellis, and\r\nthese have been supplemented by the researches of C. H. Stratz, Karl von\r\nden Steinen, etc.\r\n\r\nHavelock Ellis distinguishes an =animal= and a =social= factor of shame.\r\nThe former is specifically of a sexual nature, and is the simplest and\r\nmost primitive element in the sense of shame. It is unquestionably more\r\nstrongly developed in woman than in man; originally, indeed, it was\r\npeculiar to the female sex, and was the expression of the endeavour to\r\nprotect the genital organs against the undesired approach of the male.\r\nIn this form we may observe the sense of shame in other animals.\r\n\r\nThe sexual sense of shame of the female animal, declares Havelock Ellis,\r\nis rooted in the sexual periodicity of the female sex in general, and is\r\nan involuntary expression of the organic fact that the present time is\r\nnot the time for love. Since this fact persists throughout the greater\r\npart of the life of the females of all animals kept under man’s\r\ncontrol, the expression of this sense of warding off becomes so much a\r\nmatter of custom that it manifests itself also at times when it has\r\nceased to be appropriate. We see this, for example, in the bitch, which,\r\nwhen on heat, herself runs up to the dog, but then turns round again and\r\ntries to run away, and finally permits copulation only after the most\r\ndelicate approaches on the part of the dog. =In this manner the sense of\r\nshame becomes more and more a simple manifestation of the proximity of\r\nthe male; it comes to be expected by the male, and takes its place among\r\nhis ideas of what is sexually desirable in the female.= Thus the sense\r\nof shame would appear to be also explicable as =a psychical secondary\r\nsexual character=. The sexual sense of shame of the female, continues\r\nHavelock Ellis, is, therefore, the unavoidable by-product of the\r\nnaturally aggressive demeanour of the male being in sexual relations,\r\nand of the naturally repellent demeanour of the female; and this, again,\r\nis founded upon the fact that--in man and in nearly all the species\r\nallied to him--the sexual function of the female is periodic, and must\r\nalways be treated with circumspection by the other sex; whereas in the\r\nmale any care of this kind in regard to the exercise of his own sexual\r\nfunctions is seldom or never needed.\r\n\r\nGroos very rightly points out that the great biological and\r\npsychological importance of =coquetry= is dependent upon this protective\r\nnature of the sense of shame, coquetry arising from the conflict between\r\nthe sexual instinct and the innate sense of shame. It is to some extent\r\nthe turning to account of the sense of shame for sensual purposes, a\r\nseldom failing speculation on the sexual impulse of the male, and in\r\nthis sense it is the outcome of a genuine gynecocratic instinct, which\r\nwe shall again encounter in our study of masochism.\r\n\r\nSince, then, it is no longer possible to question the data of the most\r\nrecent researches, by which we are assured of the existence of a\r\nprimitively organic animal basis for the sexual feeling of shame, it is\r\nquite as little open to doubt that the true psychic individual\r\nimportance of the feeling of shame arises out of a second fundamental\r\nelement of that feeling, out of the =social= factor; and this factor\r\nalso affords an explanation of the origin of the sense of shame in man.\r\nThis phenomenal form of the sense of shame is, moreover, specifically\r\nhuman.\r\n\r\nThis second social fundamental element of the sense of shame is =the\r\nfear of arousing disgust=.\r\n\r\nIn this connexion we must refer to the interesting and thoroughly\r\nnaturalistic theory of Lombroso regarding the origin of the sense of\r\nshame. Lombroso starts from the observation that in many prostitutes\r\nthere exists a kind of remarkable equivalent of the sense of\r\nshame--namely, the dislike to permit of an inspection of their genital\r\norgans when they are menstruating, or when for any other reason the\r\norgans are not clean. Now, the Romance term for shame is derived from\r\n“putere,” which indicates the origin of the sense of shame from the\r\nrepugnance to the smell of decomposing secretions. If we connect with\r\nthis the fact that the kiss was originally a smell, Lombroso declares\r\nthat this pseudo-shame of prostitutes represents the original, primitive\r\nsense of shame of primeval woman--that is, the fear of being disgusting\r\nto man.[73] Sergi also accepts this hypothesis of Lombroso’s.\r\n\r\nAccording to Richet’s studies regarding the origin of disgust, the\r\ngenito-anal region, with its secretions and excrements, is an object of\r\ndisgust among most primitive races, for which reason they carefully\r\nconceal it even from their own sex, but more particularly from the other\r\nsex. Later, quite commonly the fear of arousing dislike or disgust plays\r\na prominent part in the production of the sense of shame. This fear\r\nrelates not only to the actual sexual organs, but also to the buttocks.\r\nAmong many primitive races the latter alone are covered.\r\n\r\nThe idea also of =ceremonial= uncleanness, aroused especially by the\r\nprocess of menstruation, and associated with ritual practices, plays a\r\npart in the genesis of the sense of shame.\r\n\r\nIncontestably, however, the sense of shame has most intimate relations\r\nwith =clothing=; but clothing is in part only to be referred to the\r\nabove-described primary factors of the sense of shame. In the later\r\ncourse of the development of civilization, however, clothing has come to\r\nplay a peculiar independent rôle in the further development of a refined\r\nsexual sense of shame.\r\n\r\nKarl von den Steinen is led, as the result of his own observations among\r\nthe Bakäiri of Central Brazil, to the most remarkable conclusions.\r\n\r\n  “I find it,” he writes, “impossible to believe that the sense of\r\n  shame, which is entirely wanting among these naked Indians, can in\r\n  other men be a primary sense. I am compelled to believe that this\r\n  sense first made its appearance after certain parts of the body had\r\n  been covered by clothing, and that the nakedness of women was first\r\n  concealed from the gaze of others when, perhaps, in very slightly\r\n  complicated economic and social conditions, the value of marriageable\r\n  girls had increased, in consequence of more active intercourse, as is\r\n  now the case among the principal families in Schingu. I am also of\r\n  opinion that we make the explanation more difficult than it really is\r\n  when we theoretically believe ourselves to possess a greater sense of\r\n  shame than we practically have.”[74]\r\n\r\nThus we find that among the Bakäiri, who go =completely naked=, our\r\n(sexual) sense of shame is almost completely undeveloped; more\r\nespecially, a sense of shame due to disclosure of parts does not exist,\r\nwhilst the purely animal, physiological sense of shame is clearly\r\nmanifested by these people.[75]\r\n\r\nWhere nudity is customary, the erotic sense of shame is very slightly\r\ndeveloped. Civilized man also accustoms himself with incredible\r\nquickness to nudity, as if it were an entirely natural condition.\r\n\r\n  “The feeling of being in the presence of nudity is no longer noticed\r\n  after a quarter of an hour, and when those who witness it are\r\n  intentionally reminded of it, and are asked whether naked men and\r\n  women, fathers, mothers, and children, who are standing about or\r\n  walking unconcernedly, should be condemned or regarded with compassion\r\n  on account of their shamelessness, the observer only feels inclined to\r\n  laugh, as at something quite absurd, or to protest at a preposterous\r\n  suggestion.... With what rapidity in unfamiliar regions it is possible\r\n  to become accustomed to a purely nude environment is most clearly\r\n  shown by the fact that I myself, in the night from the 15th to the\r\n  16th September, and again on the following night, dreamed of my German\r\n  home, and there in my dream I saw all my acquaintances as completely\r\n  nude as the Bakäiri with whom I was sojourning. I myself felt\r\n  astonished at this, but my neighbour at table at a dinner-party at\r\n  which in my dream I was a guest, a lady of quality, at once bade me\r\n  compose myself, and said, ‘Now we all go like this.’”[76]\r\n\r\nThe Bakäiri, who go completely naked, have no “private parts.” They jest\r\nabout these parts verbally and pictorially with complete indifference.\r\nIt would be ridiculous for this reason to regard them as “indecent.” The\r\nonset of puberty is celebrated in the case of both sexes by noisy\r\npopular festivals, in which the “private parts” receive a demonstrative\r\nand joyful attention. A man who wishes to inform a stranger that he is\r\nthe father of one of those present, a woman who wishes to declare\r\nherself to be the mother of a child, grasps the genital organs with an\r\nearnest and unconcerned demeanour, intending by this gesture to indicate\r\nthat they themselves are the procreators. The cloth covering the penis\r\nof the male, and the three cornered apron of the female, are not for\r\npurposes of concealment, but are simply intended to protect the mucous\r\nmembranes--as a bandage or an apron in the women, and in the men as an\r\napparatus for the mechanical treatment of phimosis.\r\n\r\nIt is only in jest that such things can be regarded as “articles of\r\nclothing,” the principal object of which is to subserve the sense of\r\nshame. Sexual excitement is not concealed by this simple covering. The\r\nred threads of the Trumai, the vari-coloured cloths of the Bororo, are\r\nadornments, by which attention is attracted to this region rather than\r\nrepelled.[77] The completely naked Suyá women wash their genital organs\r\nin the river in the presence of Europeans.[78]\r\n\r\nThus among these Caribs of Central Brazil, who are still living in the\r\nstone age, we observe in all their simplicity the results of complete\r\nnudity, and we are able to determine that this nudity entirely prevents\r\nthe origination of an erotic sense of shame in our meaning of the term.\r\nThe physiological factors of the sense of shame are not, taken alone,\r\nsufficiently strong to lead to the appearance of this sense in its full\r\nstrength as a special psychical phenomenon. It is first in association\r\nwith clothing that these physiological factors have any great\r\nsignificance in the production of the sense of shame.\r\n\r\nC. H. Stratz, in a historical and anthropological study regarding\r\nwomen’s clothing (Stuttgart, 1900), has compared the data of the more\r\nrecent ethnological investigations with the facts already known in the\r\nhistory of civilization and art, and has noticed a remarkable agreement\r\nbetween the two. According to him, “the first original purpose of\r\nclothing was, not the covering, but simply and solely the =adornment= of\r\nthe naked body.”[79] The naked man feels little or no shame; the clothed\r\nman is the first to feel shame--=he feels it when the customary ornament\r\nis lacking=. This is true alike for primitive and for civilized man. For\r\nStratz very rightly points out that any manifestation of nudity which is\r\nprescribed by fashion--that is to say, by the then dominant code of\r\nbeautification--is never felt as nudity. On the contrary, a lady in a\r\nhigh-necked dress amongst the _décolletée_ ladies of a ballroom, “would\r\nfeel deeply ashamed because her breast was not bare.”\r\n\r\nThe history of =clothing= and of =fashion=, which is so closely\r\nassociated therewith, affords us the most important elements for the\r\nunderstanding of the sense of shame of modern man, and for the judgment\r\nof its importance and of its natural limitations. Moreover, clothing has\r\nmost intimate relations to love as a psychical phenomenon. “How great an\r\ninfluence,” says Emanuel Herrmann, “love exercises, in all its stages,\r\nupon clothing, and how clearly, on the other hand, love is expressed by\r\nclothing!”[80] Clothing more especially satisfies the general human\r\nneed, proved by Hoche and myself to exist, for variety in sexual\r\nrelationships, which continually demands new allurements and new\r\nstimuli.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary stage of clothing, a kind of symbolic clothing for\r\nprimitive man, is the =staining=, =painting=, and =tattooing=, of the\r\nskin, regarding which recent ethnological researches, especially those\r\nof Westermarck,[81] Joest,[82] and Marquardt,[83] have afforded us\r\nnoteworthy conclusions.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact of great interest that the tendency to painting and\r\nadorning the body existed already in prehistoric times, thus affording\r\na notable illustration of the truth of Herbert Spencer’s opinion that\r\nthe vanity of uncivilized man was much greater than that of civilized\r\nman. In palæolithic dwellings coloured earths have actually been\r\ndiscovered, and coloured pastes made by mixing iron rust with reindeer\r\nfat, which unquestionably were employed for the colouring of the human\r\nbody. Moreover, as Ludwig Stein remarks, the history of cosmetics, which\r\nLord Bacon, in his “Cosmetica,” dated from the days of Biblical\r\nantiquity, can be traced back with certainty to the man of the ice age,\r\nupon whose individual and moral qualities this fact throws a significant\r\nlight. According to Klaatsch, palæolithic man was not contented simply\r\nwith painting his skin; he also tattooed himself by means of fine flint\r\nknives.[84]\r\n\r\nPainting and tattooing of the body must, then, be regarded as a\r\nprimitive stage of clothing. Ploss-Bartels remarks: “I find it\r\nimpossible to doubt that the original meaning of tattooing is to be\r\nfound in the endeavour =to cover nakedness=”; and Joest, the most\r\nlearned student of tattooing, is of the same opinion. He writes: “The\r\nless a man clothes himself, the more he tattoos his skin; and the more\r\nhe clothes himself, the less he tattoos.”[85]\r\n\r\nWe must also regard the coloration of the skin produced by tattooing as\r\na means of allurement; tattooing was, in fact, =principally= carried out\r\nfor the purpose of sexual allurement and stimulation. The tattooed man\r\nis the more beautiful, the more worthy object of desire. Even in cases\r\nin which painting and tattooing were originally undertaken for other\r\npurposes--for instance, with some therapeutic aim, or perhaps to serve\r\nas means of social or political differentiation--still, these signs and\r\nvisible changes in the skin of the body speedily exerted a powerful\r\ninfluence upon the other sex, and by sexual selection were converted\r\ninto sexual lures.[86]\r\n\r\nThis sexual character of tattooing is indicated also by the fact that\r\namongst numerous savage people of the South Seas, in the Caroline\r\nIslands, in New Guinea, and in the Pelew Islands, the girls, in order to\r\nattract the men, were accustomed to tattoo =exclusively the genital\r\nregion=, and especially the mons Veneris; thus, by tattooing, they made\r\nthis region markedly apparent. It is characteristic that Miklucho-Maclay\r\nat the first glance received the impression that the girl tattooed in\r\nthis manner wore on the mons Veneris a three-cornered piece of blue\r\ncloth, so closely can tattooing simulate clothing.\r\n\r\nThe sexual nature of tattooing is also shown by its association with\r\n=phallic= festivals. In Tahiti there is a very characteristic legend\r\nregarding the sexual origin of tattooing.[87] Among many primitive\r\npeoples the first appearance of menstruation gives the signal for\r\ntattooing, and for priapistic festivals.\r\n\r\nAn important sexual relationship is also manifested by the =colour=\r\nelement of tattooing. It appears that the sense of love in primitive man\r\nis closely connected with the sight of particular colours. According to\r\nKonrad Lange, the sensual voluptuous value of these colours obtained its\r\npeculiar character from the feeling of love associated with viewing\r\nthem; and, speaking generally, we can prove the existence of a certain\r\n=association between the love of colour and the sexual impulse=. Lange\r\nrecords an experience of his own youth, that when, about fourteen years\r\nof age, he was glancing at a vari-coloured necktie he had feelings which\r\nwere not very different in their nature from sexual desire. He rightly\r\ndraws attention to the fact that in primitive man this association of\r\nideas is especially vivid, for the reason that, as already stated, the\r\npainting of the body is usually first undertaken at the time of the\r\ncommencement of puberty.[88]\r\n\r\nIt is a significant fact that among modern civilized peoples the\r\npractice of tattooing is generally confined to certain lower classes of\r\nthe population, such as sailors, criminals, and prostitutes, among whom\r\nthe primitive impulses remain active in a quite exceptional strength, as\r\nLombroso has more especially shown in his “Palimsesti di Carcere,” and\r\nin his works on the criminal and the prostitute. Very frequently obscene\r\ntattooings were found in such persons.[89] Marro, Lacassagne, Batut, and\r\nRudolf Bergh, have also studied the tattooings of prostitutes and\r\ncriminals, and have observed the same objects and ornaments in both\r\nclasses. Salillas in Spain, Drago in the Argentine, Ellis and Greaves in\r\nEngland, and Tronow in Russia, obtained similar results. In 12·5 per\r\ncent. of the inmates of reformatories in Brieg, Kurella found that the\r\nskin was tattooed. According to him, cynicism, revenge, cruelty,\r\nremorselessness, gloomy or indifferent fatalism, bestial lewdness, with\r\na dominant tendency to unnatural vices of every kind, “constituted the\r\nprincipal psychical manifestations exhibited by these tattoo-pictures.”\r\n\r\n  “Pæderastic symbols among the men, and tribadistic among the female\r\n  prostitutes, are of especially frequent occurrence, and among these we\r\n  often find a mackerel sketched on the vulva, denoting the _souteneur_;\r\n  still more perverse sexual representations even French authors such as\r\n  Batut have not ventured to reproduce; we see things which would send\r\n  the _police des mœurs_ out of their minds. Already in quite young\r\n  vagabonds, frequently sons of prostitutes, we see representations of\r\n  this kind.”[90]\r\n\r\nNot only, however, in criminals and prostitutes, but also in the\r\nnon-criminal members of the lowest classes of the population, we often\r\nobserve erotic tattooings of the most obscene character, which, without\r\ndoubt, serve as sexual lures and stimuli. J. Robinsohn and Friedrich S.\r\nKrauss recently published an interesting account of these matters.[91]\r\n\r\n  =Cases of Tattooing in Women of the Upper Classes.=--It appears that\r\n  the primitive tendency to tattooing as a sexual stimulus and means of\r\n  allurement has recently revived in certain circles of the refined\r\n  sensual world. René Schwaeblé, in his celebrated book based on his own\r\n  observations and moral studies, and entitled, “Les Détraquées de\r\n  Paris” (Paris, 1904), gives an account of the increasing diffusion of\r\n  tattooing among both men and women of the upper classes of Parisian\r\n  society, for which purpose a specialist has opened an _atelier_ in the\r\n  Rue Blanche, in Montmartre. Schwaeblé devotes a special chapter to the\r\n  “_tatouées_” (pp. 47-57), and describes an assembly of some of these\r\n  distinguished libertines in a house in the Rue de la Pompe in Passy.\r\n  In one of these ladies, tattooing imitated in a most deceptive manner\r\n  a pair of stockings, thus affording a characteristic instance of the\r\n  above-mentioned association between tattooing and clothing. Another\r\n  woman had inscriptions tattooed on the thighs and hips; in two the\r\n  legs were adorned with garlands of vine-leaves, birds were billing on\r\n  the abdomen, and on the back were depicted many coloured bouquets of\r\n  flowers, with the inscription, “X. pinxit, after Watteau.” A\r\n  marchioness had her family coat-of-arms depicted between the shoulder\r\n  blades; another great lady had had tattooed on her body the maddest\r\n  and most obscene drawings of a satanistic character! Two unmistakably\r\n  homosexual women had a common tattooing--that is to say, one was\r\n  complementary to the other; only when they were side by side had the\r\n  picture a meaning. The most remarkable of all the tattooings, however,\r\n  was that of the hostess. On her body was the picture of a complete\r\n  hunt, the individual scenes of which wound round her body; it was in\r\n  the most vivid colours; carriages, packs of hounds and hunters were\r\n  all shown. The final goal of the hunt was a fox tattooed in the\r\n  genital region.\r\n\r\nTattooing leads on to the consideration of =many-coloured clothing=,\r\nwhich is especially common in primitive conditions of mankind. Such\r\nclothing, in such conditions, serves chiefly to accentuate particular\r\nportions of the body, in order to stimulate the sexual appetite of\r\nmembers of the opposite sex. According to Moseley, the savage begins by\r\npainting and tattooing himself for the sake of adornment. Then he takes\r\na movable appendage, which he throws round his body, and on which he\r\nplaces the ornamentation =which he had previously marked on his skin in\r\na more or less ineradicable manner=. Now a greater =variation= is\r\nrendered possible than was the case with tattooing and painting. Thus,\r\nby means of vari-coloured and bright bands, fringes, girdles, and\r\naprons, which for the most part are attached in the genital region,\r\nattention is drawn to this part--and here a =contrast of colours= is\r\nfound extremely effective. The Indians of the Admiralty Islands have as\r\ntheir only article of clothing a brilliant white mussel-shell, which\r\nexhibits a striking contrast to the dark colour of their skin. The\r\nAreois of Tahiti, a class of privileged libertines and voluptuous\r\nindividuals, manifested this character in public places by wearing a\r\ngirdle made of “ti-leaves.”[92]\r\n\r\nThe first and most primitive form of clothing was this =pubic ornament=,\r\nthe original purpose of which was adornment, not concealment. The latter\r\nsignificance it acquired only in proportion as the genital organs became\r\nthe object of a superstitious feeling of fear and respect, and were\r\nregarded as the seat of a dangerous magic.[93] The above-mentioned\r\nconnexion between sexuality and magic here made itself apparent. It was\r\nnecessary that this wonderful, daimonic region should be concealed, in\r\norder to protect an onlooker from its evil and influence, or,\r\ncontrariwise, to protect the genital region from the evil glance of the\r\nobserver. Both ideas are ethnologically demonstrable. According to\r\nDürkheim, the genital organs, and especially those of women, were\r\ncovered in primitive times, in order to prevent the perception of any\r\ndisagreeable emanations from these regions. Finally, Waitz, Schurz, and\r\nLetourneau propounded the theory that the jealousy of primitive man was\r\nthe primary ground of clothing, and was indirectly also the cause of the\r\nsense of shame. This view is supported by the interesting ethnological\r\nfact that in many races only the married women are clothed, whilst the\r\nfully-grown unmarried girls go completely naked. The married woman is\r\npart of the property of the husband; to the latter, clothing appears to\r\nbe a protection against glances at his property--to unclothe the wife is\r\na dishonour and a shame. When the idea of possession was extended to the\r\nrelationship between the father and his unmarried daughters, these\r\nlatter also were clothed; thus the idea of chastity and the feeling of\r\nshame were developed.[94]\r\n\r\nWe can, however, adduce numerous considerations in support of the view\r\nthat the first covering of the genital organs, in association with the\r\npubic ornament, did not arise out of the feeling of shame, but, on the\r\ncontrary, that it served as a means of sexual allurement. By all kinds\r\nof striking ornaments, such as cat’s tails, mussel-shells, or strips of\r\nhide, fastened either in front or behind, every possible attention was\r\nattracted to the genital region or the buttocks.[95] Concealment made\r\nitself felt as a =more powerful= sensual stimulus than nudity. This is\r\nan old anthropological experience which still possesses great\r\nsignificance in our modern civilized life.\r\n\r\nVirey believed that human beings had more intense and manifold sexual\r\nenjoyments than the lower animals, because these latter see their wives\r\nat all times without any kind of adornment, whereas the half-opened veil\r\nwith which the human female conceals or partially discloses her charms\r\nincreases a hundredfold the already boundless lust of mankind. “The less\r\none sees, the more does imagination picture.”[96] That which causes a\r\nrefined and sensual stimulus is not the entirely naked, but the\r\nhalf-naked or partial nudity. Westermarck remarks:\r\n\r\n  “We have numerous examples of races who generally go about completely\r\n  naked, but sometimes employ a covering. In such cases they always wear\r\n  the latter in circumstances which make it perfectly clear that the\r\n  covering is used simply as a means of allurement. Thus, Lohmann\r\n  relates that among the Saliras only prostitutes wear clothing, and\r\n  they do this =in order to stimulate by means of the unknown=. Barth\r\n  informs us that among many heathen races in Central Africa, the\r\n  married women go entirely naked, whilst the girls ripe for marriage\r\n  clothe themselves (in order that they may appear worthy of desire).\r\n  The married women of Tipperah wear no more than a short apron, while\r\n  the unmarried girls cover the breasts with vari-coloured cloths with\r\n  fringed edges. Among the Toungta, the breasts of the women remain\r\n  uncovered after the birth of the first child, but the unmarried women\r\n  wear a narrow breast-cloth.”[97]\r\n\r\nThe significance of clothing and partial clothing as a sexual stimulus,\r\nproved by K. von den Steinen and Stratz to exist among primitive\r\npeoples, can be shown to form an element in the “fashion” of civilized\r\nraces, which provides the imagination with entirely new sexual stimuli,\r\nby means of the two fundamental elements of the =accentuation= and\r\n=disclosure= of certain parts, and speaks to man of “hidden joys.” Moses\r\nmade use of this psychical sexual influence of clothing. He wished to\r\nincrease the numbers of his small people, and therefore he ordered the\r\n=concealment= of the feminine charms, “=in order to stimulate the senses\r\nof the male members of his community=, and thus increase the fertility\r\nof his people.”[98] Nudity, rejected by him as =unsuitable=, came in the\r\nChristian teaching to be regarded as “=immoral=”; for such a change in\r\nthe point of view, we can find numerous examples in the public life of\r\nthe present day.\r\n\r\nThe greatest sensual stimulus is exerted by the =half-clothing= or\r\n=partial disclosure= of the body, the so-called _retroussé_--that is,\r\nthe art of bringing about a refined mutual influence between the charms\r\nof clothing and the charms of the body.[99] This plays a very important\r\npart in the origination of the so-called “clothes fetichism,” which we\r\nshall describe at greater length when we come to the consideration of\r\nthese sexual anomalies.\r\n\r\nThere are two fundamental forms of clothing, the =tropical= (coat and\r\nsash) and the =arctic= (doublet and hose), and these, in addition to\r\ntheir simple function of protecting in the tropics from the powerful\r\nrays of the sun, and in the northern climates of protecting from cold,\r\nserve also in both sexes as a means of sexual allurement. The changeful\r\nphenomena and phases of “fashion in clothing” afford the most certain\r\nproofs of this fact; they may, in fact, be regarded as the most valuable\r\nsexual psychological documents of the successive epochs of\r\ncivilization. The celebrated writer on æsthetics Friedrich Theodor\r\nVischer has regarded them especially from this point of view in his\r\noriginal work, distinguished by its pithy style, “Fashion and Cynicism:\r\nContributions to the Knowledge of the Forms of Civilization and of our\r\nMoral Ideas” (Stuttgart, 1888). He regards “the rage to excel in\r\nman-catching” as “the most powerful of impulses, capable of inflaming to\r\nfever-heat the madness of fashion, with its brainless changes, its\r\nfurious inclinations, its raging distortions.” In a certain sense we may\r\nalso speak of some of the fashions of men’s clothing as an art of\r\n“woman-catching.” Still, on the whole, this feature is much less\r\nmanifest here than in relation to woman’s clothing.\r\n\r\nClothing has a sexually stimulating influence in a twofold manner:\r\neither certain parts are especially =accentuated= and =enlarged= by the\r\nshape or cut of the clothing and by peculiar kinds of ornamentation, or\r\nelse particular portions of the body are directly =denuded=. Both of\r\nthese have a sexual influence.\r\n\r\nThe accentuation and enlargement of certain parts of the body by means\r\nof clothing takes its origin in man’s belief that by this means he\r\nreally produces certain enlargements of his personality, =as though\r\nthese portions of clothing were actually a part of himself=. This\r\nremarkable theory of clothing, according to which the latter represents\r\na =strengthening of the body=, a kind of outwardly projected emanation\r\nof the human personality, a direct continuation of the body, was first\r\nenunciated by the celebrated philosopher Hermann Lotze. He writes:\r\n\r\n  “Everywhere when we place a foreign body in connexion with the surface\r\n  of our body (for not the hand alone develops this peculiarity), =the\r\n  consciousness of our personal identity is in a certain sense\r\n  transmitted into the ends and outer surface of this foreign body=, and\r\n  there arise feelings, partly of an enlargement of our personal ego,\r\n  partly of a change in form and in extent of movement, now become\r\n  possible to us, but naturally foreign to our organs, and partly of an\r\n  unaccustomed tension, firmness, or security of our carriage.”[100]\r\n\r\nNaturally the reciprocal influence of one person upon another is not\r\nwanting, and the observer believes that in the clothing he actually\r\nfinds the body. Parts that otherwise would not have attracted attention\r\nnow appear as important objects. For example, the tall hat, as a\r\nprolongation of the head, seems to give the latter a certain height and\r\nworth. Gustave Flaubert, in “Madame Bovary,” very beautifully describes\r\nthis remarkable transition, this identification of clothing with the\r\nbody:\r\n\r\n  “Beneath her hair, which was drawn upwards towards the top of the\r\n  head, the skin of the nape of her neck appeared to have a brownish\r\n  tint, which gradually became paler, and lost itself in the shadows of\r\n  her clothing. Her dress spread out on either side over the chair on\r\n  which she was sitting; it fell in many folds, and spread out on the\r\n  floor. When he chanced to touch it with his foot, he immediately drew\r\n  the foot back again, =as if he had trodden on something living=.”\r\n\r\nThe same association of ideas has led to the idea that clothing “is, as\r\nit were, a complete skin to man,” as if it must represent a kind of\r\n“ideal nudity.”[101] Clothing represents the person, shelters the\r\nnature, the soul. It can, therefore, become the means of expression of\r\nhuman peculiarities, of individual traits of character. There exists a\r\n“physiognomy” of clothing; it is a mirror of the physical and spiritual\r\nbeing.[102] Very rightly is it asserted, in a pseudonymous essay on the\r\n“Erotics of Clothing,” that clothing, in the course of the many thousand\r\nyears of the development of civilization, has taken up into itself so\r\nmuch of the =spirit= of mankind that we should find a solution for all\r\nthe problems of human civilization if we were able completely and\r\nimmediately to understand the spirit of clothing. The form of clothing\r\nis at the same time also the most subtle and accurate measuring\r\napparatus for the peculiar and personal in a man--for the individual in\r\nhim.[103]\r\n\r\nIf the accentuation of certain parts is the first sexual stimulus of\r\nclothing the denuding of certain parts is the second. When once the\r\ncustom of concealing the body has been introduced, the denuding of\r\nportions of the body has acquired a sexually stimulating effect which it\r\ndid not previously possess, and which it does not now possess among\r\nprimitive communities. In the saying of a thoughtful writer, that there\r\nis a great difference from an erotic point of view between a glance at\r\nthe naked leg of a sturdy peasant girl and a glance at the naked leg of\r\na fashionable young lady, this different conception of nudity finds very\r\nclear expression. There is, in fact, a natural, sexually indifferent\r\nnudity, and an artificial, erotically stimulating nudity. It is the\r\nlatter only which plays a part in the history of clothing and of\r\nfashion; and it is this, in association with the erotic accentuation of\r\ncertain portions of the body, which has from early times been cultivated\r\nfor the allurement of men, and above all by the world of prostitution\r\nand by the half-world.\r\n\r\nThis first occurred in classical antiquity, to which, however, true\r\n“fashion” was unknown, because clothing was not then, as it is in modern\r\ntimes, fused with the body, and therefore did not appear to be a\r\ncontinuation and representation of the bodily personality. In general,\r\nthe refined quality of the modern “mode” was lacking, in regard to the\r\naccentuation of particular parts of the body by means of clothing. Very\r\naptly has Schopenhauer, in the second volume of his “Parerga and\r\nParalipomena,” pointed out the thorough-going difference between antique\r\nand modern clothing in this relationship. In the days of antiquity\r\nclothing was still a whole, which remained distinct from the body, and\r\nwhich allowed the human form to be recognized as distinctly as possible\r\nin all its parts. Sexual stimulation could be effected only by the\r\nemployment of =diaphanous= fabrics, which were preferred in the circles\r\nof the half-world and by effeminate men. Varro, Juvenal, and Seneca\r\nchastise with biting words this immorality of “coacæ vestes,” and of the\r\nnetwork clothing imported from Egypt. Then there appeared for the first\r\ntime as a peculiar type the woman in man’s clothing, a proof of the wide\r\ndiffusion of the love of boys, on which those prostitutes who went about\r\nclothed as men must have speculated when they assumed this dress.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of clothing into =upper-clothing= and =under-clothing=\r\nsignifies a differentiation of clothing very effective as regards erotic\r\ninfluence. For the first time could the individual portions of the body\r\nappear in definite significance in relation to the body as a whole. And\r\nthe indication of the waist became characteristic of fashion in\r\nclothing.[104]\r\n\r\nThe analysis of clothing was carried a stage further in the separation\r\nof clothing, properly speaking, from that which lies beneath it, the\r\nmore intimate covering of the body, the washable underclothing--shirt,\r\nchemise, petticoat, etc. More especially had this differentiation a\r\ngreat erotic significance. It was the increase in the number of\r\nindividual articles of clothing which first gave rise to the erotically\r\ntinged idea of the gradual “dressing” and “undressing,” to the idea of\r\nthe intimate “toilet.” The possibilities of disclosure, half\r\nconcealment, and semi-nudity were notably increased, and a much larger\r\nplayground was opened to the erotic imagination.\r\n\r\nIn association with this, the waist, especially in the case of woman,\r\nindicated a separation of the bodily spheres into an upper sphere,\r\nassociated chiefly with the intellectual, and a lower sphere, belonging\r\nrather to the purely sexual.\r\n\r\n  “The waist, which is already, roughly speaking, indicated by the sash\r\n  or girdle, but which, in consequence of the progressive\r\n  differentiation of feminine clothing, comes to play a principal part\r\n  in women’s dress, divides the woman’s body into thorax and abdomen.\r\n  The fully clothed woman becomes an insect, a wasp, with two sharply\r\n  defined emotional and sexual spheres, with a heavenly and an earthly\r\n  division.”[105]\r\n\r\nWith this classification and differentiation of clothing there now\r\ndeveloped a fertile field for the activity of “fashion,” which\r\ntherefore, as such, first really takes its rise in the middle ages.\r\nAccording to Sombart,[106] it was in the Italian States of the fifteenth\r\ncentury that it first became a living reality. Fashion is a product of\r\nthe Christian middle ages; the specific element that this period\r\nintroduced into feminine clothing--the corset--is a witness to Christian\r\ndoctrine.\r\n\r\nStratz remarks on this subject:\r\n\r\n  “Strange as it may seem, it is very remarkably true that =the corset\r\n  derives its origin from the Christian worship of God=. Owing to the\r\n  strict ecclesiastical control in the middle ages--strict, at least, as\r\n  regards public life--the dominant ascetic point of view demanded the\r\n  fullest possible covering of the feminine body, and the =mortification\r\n  of the flesh=; it insisted, at any rate, that those portions of the\r\n  body should be withdrawn from the view of sinful man which are\r\n  regarded as especially characteristic of the female sex. Through woman\r\n  sin had entered the world, and therefore woman must, above all, take\r\n  care to conceal as much as possible the sinful characteristics of her\r\n  baser sex. Whilst man, by the greatest possible increase in breadth of\r\n  shoulders and chest, endeavoured to suggest a more powerful and\r\n  warlike aspect, we find that among women from the twelfth to the\r\n  sixteenth century, the endeavour was dominant to make the breasts as\r\n  flat and childlike and as narrow as possible, and for this purpose,\r\n  =for the compression and obliteration of the breasts, an early form of\r\n  the corset was employed=.”[107]\r\n\r\nIt is characteristic that fashion later employed the corset in precisely\r\nthe =opposite= sense--namely, in order to make the breasts “stand out\r\nmore prominently above the upper margin of the corset, which continually\r\nbecame shorter.” Thus there arose a conflict between medieval fashion\r\nand the ascetic tendencies of the times. Fashion was victorious along\r\nthe whole line, as we can learn in detail in Ritter’s interesting essay\r\nregarding the nudities of the middle ages.[108]\r\n\r\nSince the middle ages, two portions of the body have in the female sex\r\nbeen especially accentuated by clothing--the breasts, and the region of\r\nthe hips and the buttocks.\r\n\r\nAs we have already pointed out, the corset was especially employed to\r\naccentuate the breasts, the corset having already produced the\r\nstimulating contrast between the prominence of the breast and the\r\nslenderness of the waist, increased by lacing. At the same time, at an\r\nearly date the denuding of the upper part of the breasts was associated\r\nwith this accentuation, the top of the dress being cut away in front _à\r\nla grand’ gorge_, whilst the corset, strengthened by rods of whalebone\r\nor steel, produced a _bonne conché_. This accentuation of the breasts\r\ndominated feminine fashion down to the present day. Besides the use of\r\nthe corset in this matter, the region of the breasts was also rendered\r\nmore prominent by the use of artificial breasts made of wax, by\r\nornaments in the form of breast-rings, etc.\r\n\r\nThe partial denuding of the breasts represents the true _décolleté_ of\r\nour balls and parties, a custom which a man so tolerant in other\r\nrespects as H. Bahr condemns on æsthetic grounds.[109]\r\n\r\n  “The art of undressing and enjoying =in imagination= beautiful girls\r\n  and women,” says Georg Hirth, “is learnt chiefly at Court and other\r\n  balls, at which the feminine guests are compelled by fashion to bare\r\n  the upper part of the body. It is astonishing how quickly, how\r\n  invariably, the girls of the upper classes accustom themselves to this\r\n  exhibition, which exercises so stimulating an effect upon us of the\r\n  opposite sex. And yet they would turn up their noses if, at the\r\n  parties of non-commissioned officers and servants, the women allowed\r\n  such extensive glimpses of their charms. I once heard a girl three\r\n  years of age express a naive surprise when she saw the _décolletage_\r\n  of her mother, who was about to go to a ball. What a scolding would\r\n  the poor servant-girl get if _she_ were to exhibit her nudity to the\r\n  children in such a manner!”[110]\r\n\r\nFr. Th. Vischer also severely criticizes this exposure of feminine\r\nnudities _coram publico_. Moreover, the free enjoyment of alcohol\r\ncustomary among men at these evening entertainments is likely to induce\r\na frame of mind in which the charms thus freely displayed before their\r\neyes will receive an attention _not_ purely æsthetic.\r\n\r\nAs regards the corset more particularly, it is not only =unæsthetic=,\r\nbut also =unhygienic=.\r\n\r\nThe corset draws in the beautiful outline of the feminine body in the\r\nmost disagreeable manner; the wasp waist which it produces is an ugly\r\nexaggeration of the natural condition. The lady editor of the _Documents\r\nof Women_ instituted an inquiry amongst a number of artists in regard to\r\nthe corset. One of these, the architect Leopold Bauer, replied as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  “Nature has endowed the feminine body with a most beautiful outline.\r\n  It is almost incomprehensible that the ideal of beauty should during\r\n  so lengthy a period aim at the destruction of this wonderful and\r\n  unique perfection. The corset makes an ugly bend in the vertebral\r\n  column, it makes the hip shapeless, it suggests an unnatural and even\r\n  repulsive development of the breasts, which transforms our sentiment\r\n  of the sacred beauty of the human body into the lowest sexual and\r\n  perverse impulses. That the corset does _not_ really make the body\r\n  appear slender is no longer open to doubt. All the suggested\r\n  advantages of the corset are prejudices.... It is only when women’s\r\n  dress is freed from the tyranny of this detestable corset that it will\r\n  be able to develop in a free and artistic manner.”[111]\r\n\r\nPhysicians are unanimous regarding the unhygienic nature of the corset.\r\nThe deleterious influence of tight-lacing upon the form and the activity\r\nof the thoracic and abdominal organs has been thoroughly elucidated by\r\nmany authors. I need refer only, among many, to the writings of Hugo\r\nKlein,[112] Menge,[113] and O. Rosenbach,[114] regarding the dangers of\r\nthe corset. The corset hinders the sufficient inspiration, which is so\r\nnecessary for the adequate activity of the respiratory and circulatory\r\norgans, and herein we find a principal cause of anæmia (O. Rosenbach);\r\nit exercises the most harmful pressure on the abdominal organs,\r\nespecially on the stomach and the liver, and presses them out of their\r\nnatural situation, so that it gives rise to a descent of the kidneys,\r\nthe liver, and the genital organs. The extremely ugly “pendulous belly”\r\nis also dependent on the influence of the corset. The pressure of the\r\ncorset also often gives rise to an atrophy of the mammary glands, and to\r\nabnormal changes in the nipples. Thence ensues, further, a serious\r\nhindrance to the function of lactation, which may indeed be rendered\r\ncompletely impossible. For this reason, Georg Hirth, in his admirable\r\nessay upon the indispensable character of the maternal breast, exclaims:\r\n“Away with the corset!”[115]\r\n\r\nThe dorsal and abdominal muscles also undergo partial atrophy in\r\nconsequence of the habitual wearing of the corset, because this garment\r\nto some extent relieves these muscles of their natural function. Anæmia,\r\ngastric and hepatic disorders, and intercostal neuralgia are also\r\ndependent upon this “most disastrous error of woman’s dress,” as von\r\nKrafft-Ebing calls the corset. Menge has very thoroughly studied the\r\nhurtful influence of the corset on the feminine reproductive organs. He\r\nenumerates, as a result of wearing it, among many evil results,\r\ninflammatory states and enlargement of the ovaries, relaxation of the\r\nuterine muscles, atrophy and excessive proliferation of the uterine\r\nmucous membrane, the onset of the extremely disagreeable _fluor albus_,\r\npremature termination of pregnancy, displacements of the uterus\r\n(retroflexion, anteversion, prolapse), abnormal stretching of the entire\r\npelvic floor, retention of urine, constipation, and nervous troubles of\r\nthe most varied character. Very often, also, sterility in woman is\r\ncausally dependent upon the constriction and pressure exercised by the\r\ncorset.\r\n\r\nRightly, therefore, the abandonment of the corset plays a principal part\r\nin the “reformed dress” of woman--a subject to which we shall later\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the accentuation of the breast by the corset and by other\r\napparatus,[116] another aim of feminine fashion has been most persistent\r\nin very various forms, namely, the exaggeration of =the hips, or the\r\nbuttocks, or both=--in fact, of all the visible parts of the clothed\r\nbody which are directly related to the sexual functions of woman; that\r\nis to say, there has been a persistent endeavour to indicate in the most\r\nprominent manner, in a way to stimulate the male, the secondary sexual\r\ncharacters of the female in this region of the body.\r\n\r\n  “The thoroughly modern women,” says Heinrich Pudor, “coquet at the\r\n  present day less with their breasts than with their hind-quarters--for\r\n  this reason, because for the most part they have a masculine type\r\n  (?). It began with the _cul de Paris_. Nowadays, clothes are cut in\r\n  such a way that in the view from the back the gluteal region is\r\n  especially prominent. This is how the fashionable wife of a German\r\n  officer strikes us at present.\r\n\r\n  “‘Tailor-made’ is the phrase that has for some time been in use in\r\n  England. The tailor has made it--not the milliner. No, the tailor, who\r\n  perhaps is at the same time bath-master and masseur.... Certain\r\n  species of baboons are distinguished by their brightly coloured and\r\n  prominent hind-quarters--there seems to be no doubt that our modern\r\n  ladies in high life have taken these for their example. Or can it be\r\n  that they wish to avail themselves of the homosexual inclinations of\r\n  their male acquaintances? Beyond question this is so. Here we find the\r\n  fundamental ground of the type of clothing of our own day by which so\r\n  much attention is drawn to the region of the buttocks. What is\r\n  repulsive here is not the homosexuality, but the misuse that is made\r\n  of clothing. In fact, that which is most repulsive to a refined\r\n  sentiment is this--that women have their clothes cut as tightly as\r\n  possible round the hips, in order that the broad pelvis, which is\r\n  especially characteristic of women as a sexual being, shall be as far\r\n  as possible visibly isolated.”[117]\r\n\r\nSimilarly Fr. Th. Vischer has castigated the immorality of the gross\r\naccentuation of kallipygian charms,[118] which in the eighteenth century\r\nwas inaugurated by the invention of the so-called _tournure_ (_cul de\r\nParis_), against which Mary Wollstonecraft inveighed so severely. By the\r\ntension of the clothing, not only the buttocks, but also the hips and\r\nthe thighs, were rendered grossly apparent. In certain epochs, also, the\r\nfeminine abdomen was very markedly indicated by the mode of dress; for\r\ninstance, in the middle ages, down to the sixteenth century, fashion\r\nprovided women and girls with the insignia of pregnancy, as is apparent\r\nin the pictures of Jan van Eyck (“The Lamb,” “Eva”), Hans Memling\r\n(“Eva”), and Titian (“The Beauty of Urbino”). The fashion of the “thick\r\nabdomen” in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was only another\r\nvariation of the same theme.\r\n\r\nIn close relation to the variations of fashion we have just described is\r\nthe =farthingale= (_montgolfière_) or =crinoline=. It was first adopted\r\nin the sixteenth century by courtesans and prostitutes, who thus\r\nexhibited rounded and provocative forms, wishing to allure men by these\r\n_vertugales_, which, according to the _bon mot_ of a Franciscan,\r\nexpelled _vertu_, leaving behind only the _gale_ (syphilis). The aptest\r\nremarks regarding the repulsive and dirty fashion of the crinoline were\r\nmade by Schopenhauer.[119] It seems as if the crinoline, which is well\r\nknown to have celebrated its greatest triumph during the period of the\r\nSecond Empire in France--who is not familiar with the characteristic\r\ndaguerrotypes of that period?--has recently endeavoured to come to life\r\nonce more, for it appears that attempts have actually been made towards\r\nthe rehabilitation of this monstrosity of clothing.\r\n\r\nThe physical difference between man and woman is also beyond question\r\nthe principal cause of the difference between masculine and feminine\r\nclothing. According to Waldeyer (Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth\r\nCongress of Anthropologists at Kassel, 1895, published in the _Journal\r\nof the German Society of Anthropologists_, No. 9, p. 76), it is\r\nespecially the difference in the length and position of the thigh-bones\r\nthat is responsible for the differentiation between masculine and\r\nfeminine clothing. In woman, the upper ends of the femora are, in\r\nconsequence of the greater width of the pelvis, more widely separated\r\nthan in the male; and since in both sexes these bones are closely\r\napproximated at the knees, in women their position appears more oblique.\r\nThis, in combination with the comparative shortness of women’s thighs,\r\nhas a manifest influence upon the gait, especially in running, in which\r\nman distinctly excels woman. In this purely anatomical difference is to\r\nbe found the reason why the masculine mode of dress, which makes the\r\nlower extremities very manifest, is not adapted for woman, especially\r\nwhen in the upright posture. This is an important cause for the\r\ndifferentiation between masculine and feminine clothing.\r\n\r\nA further fundamental difference between the clothing of man and that of\r\nwoman is the much greater simplicity and monotony, on the whole, of\r\nmasculine clothing. This has, with good reason, been associated with the\r\ngreater intellectual differentiation of man, who, therefore, stands less\r\nin need of any peculiar accentuation of the individual personality by\r\nmeans of clothing. Woman, who earlier was =only= a sexual being,\r\nutilized clothing in manifold ways as a means of sexual allurement, as\r\nthe chief means of compensation for the life of activity denied her by\r\nNature and custom, whereas to man, on the whole, the employment of\r\nsexual stimulation by means of clothing was superfluous.\r\n\r\nGeorg Simmel writes from another point of view. He is of opinion that\r\nwoman, in comparison with man, is, on the whole, the more constant\r\nbeing, but that precisely this constancy, which expresses the equability\r\nand unity of her nature on the emotional side, demands, on the\r\nprinciple of compensation of vital tendencies, a more active variability\r\nin other less central provinces; whereas, on the contrary, man, in his\r\nvery nature less constant, who is not accustomed to cleave with the same\r\nunconditional concentration of all vital interests to any once\r\nexperienced emotional relationship, precisely in consequence of this,\r\nstands less in need of such external variability. Man, as regards\r\nobjective phenomena, is, on the whole, more indifferent than woman,\r\nbecause fundamentally he is the more variable being, and therefore can\r\nmore easily dispense with such objective variability.[120]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this, down to the beginning of the nineteenth century\r\nthere were not wanting, in the fashion of men’s clothing, attempts to\r\nemploy certain parts of dress for the purpose of sexual stimulation. I\r\nrefer in this connexion to my earlier contributions.[121] Here I shall\r\nallude only in passing to the peculiar and characteristic variations of\r\nmen’s clothing in the form of marked attention drawn to the male\r\ngenitals by the breeches-flap (_braguettes_); to the shoe, _à la\r\npoulaine_, which imitated the form of a male penis; to certain\r\neffeminate tendencies in the dress of man which have recurred very often\r\nsince the days of the Roman Empire,[122] which are connected with the\r\nwide diffusion of homosexual tendencies, and which sometimes have given\r\nmen’s dress so variegated a character, have involved such frequent\r\nchanges and such occasional nudities, that at these times it could enter\r\ninto competition with women’s clothing. In this respect, clothing\r\nenables us to draw conclusions not merely regarding the nature of the\r\nmen who wore it, but also regarding the character of the time. There\r\nexists also the modern dandyhood, which recalls many peculiarities of\r\nearlier times; but, on the whole, fashion in men’s clothing tends to\r\nsimplicity and sexual indifference. This movement originated in England,\r\nand the English fashion in men’s clothing has become dominant throughout\r\nthe whole world, whereas women’s clothing now, as formerly, receives its\r\nfashionable stimulus from Paris.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the indirect relations of clothing with the _vita\r\nsexualis_, which we have already described, there is a direct\r\nrelationship, and this is =the effect of certain fabrics upon the skin=,\r\nfrom which certain associations of ideas and certain abnormal\r\ntendencies may arise. Thus, for example, the contact of woollen stuffs\r\nand of furs has a sexually stimulating influence. Ryan compared their\r\ninfluence with that of flagellation.[123] In this sense, also, furs and\r\nthe whip go together--these two symbols of “masochism”; velvet has a\r\nsimilar effect. The celebrated author of “Venus im Pelz,” Leopold von\r\nSacher-Masoch, in his well-known romance bearing this name, deals fully\r\nwith the sexual significance of furs. According to him, they exert a\r\npeculiar, prickling, physical stimulus, perhaps dependent upon their\r\nbeing charged with electricity, and upon the warmth of their atmosphere.\r\nA woman in a fur coat is like a “great cat,[124] a powerful electric\r\nbattery.” Influences of smell also appear to be associated herewith.\r\nFor, in a letter to his wife, Sacher-Masoch once wrote to tell her what\r\nvoluptuous pleasure it would give to him to bathe his face in the warm\r\nodour of her furs.[125] With the description of the stimulating effect\r\nof fur dependent upon sensations of contact and smell, he associated\r\nalso the fact that fur gave woman a dominant, masterful, magical\r\ninfluence. His “Venus im Pelz” is also to him “one who commands.” Titian\r\nfound for the rosy beauty of his beloved one no more costly frame than\r\ndark fur. It is doubtless the strong contrast-effect between the\r\ndelicate charm and the shaggy surroundings that evokes that remarkable\r\nsymbolical relationship to longings for power and cruel despotism. In a\r\nthoughtful essay, “Venus im Pelz” (_Berliner Tageblatt_, No. 487,\r\nSeptember 25, 1903), the idea is developed and explained, that the love\r\nof woman for furs results from her inward nature. It is the secret\r\nlonging for an increase of her power and influence by means of\r\ncontrast.[126]\r\n\r\nMen’s and women’s clothing comprises the covering of the entire body\r\nwith the exception of the face--the idea does not, as a rule, include\r\nthe head-covering and the way the hair is dressed. In a recent work, H.\r\nPudor brings the face into a peculiar =sexual relationship with the\r\nclothing=. His remarks on this subject, which contain many valuable\r\nobservations, notwithstanding the fact that much of what he says is\r\noverdrawn, run as follows:\r\n\r\n  “There is no doubt that the face is a bearer of the sexual sense in\r\n  the second and third degree. Not only the mouth or the larynx. The\r\n  nose, especially in virtue of the mucous membranes by which odours are\r\n  perceived. The eye, in virtue of the magnetic currents, the perception\r\n  of light, and the chemical activity of the retina. But even the cheeks\r\n  and the ears. Let some one you are fond of whisper something into your\r\n  ear--notice the emotional wave you will feel, and observe how from the\r\n  ear there are paths of conduction to the sexual cells [!]. Above all,\r\n  however, naturally the mouth. We speak of the labia of the female\r\n  genital organs, and therewith already we indicate the relationship to\r\n  the lips of the mouth. We can, in fact, prove the existence, not only\r\n  of a parallelism in the structure of the mouth and that of the sexual\r\n  organs, in man just as in woman. We can go even further: we can regard\r\n  the sacral region as the forehead, the anal region as the nose, the\r\n  pudendal region as the mouth, and the gluteal region as the cheeks\r\n  [!].\r\n\r\n  “If we regard the sexual differentiation of the features of the face\r\n  as established, from this standpoint we gain an interesting light upon\r\n  the deeper lying causes of the wearing of clothes. Civilized mankind\r\n  conceals the sexual organs of the first degree; the sexual organs of\r\n  the third degree--that is, the features of the face--are left naked;\r\n  in fact, on account of the thorough way in which the parts of the body\r\n  adjacent to the face are covered, stress is actually laid upon the\r\n  nakedness of the face as bearing sexual organs of the third\r\n  degree--now we recognize the rôle played by the hat--and by means of\r\n  that which we call coquetry, we see mirrored in the features the\r\n  proper sexual organs, or we have our attention drawn to the sexual\r\n  organs by means of the features, and by the latter we are made aware\r\n  of certain peculiarities of the former. In this connexion, let us\r\n  remember certain facial adornments which serve to limit still more the\r\n  naked area of the face, and to clothe a larger portion of that region,\r\n  such as the locks of hair covering the ears which the dancer Cléo de\r\n  Mérode introduced, ringlets such as were worn in youth by our\r\n  grandmothers, or the chin-band drawn across the middle of the chin.\r\n  Perhaps even other ornaments of the face (neck-band, ear-rings, and\r\n  even eyeglasses and lorgnette [!]) also play a certain part in this\r\n  connexion. Think, above all, of the stand-up collar and all other\r\n  varieties of high collar by which the clothing is carried up as high\r\n  as the chin. But those parts of the face which remain naked must now\r\n  be as naked as possible; for this reason hairs, unless they belong to\r\n  the beard as sexual organs of the second degree, must be removed, and\r\n  society determinedly insists that faces shall be clean-shaven.”[127]\r\n\r\nThe relation of the face to the clothing already makes clear to us the\r\nidea of “costume” as an extension of clothing beyond the mere covering\r\nof the body. All which surrounds man, which has a relation to his\r\nappearance, is costume in the widest sense of the word; thus,\r\nsitting-room, workshop, study, dressing-room, park, library, etc.\r\n\r\n  “We take pains regarding all that we have nearest to us and round\r\n  about us, our toilet, because therein we are at home, therein we\r\n  suffer and we rejoice. Where we feel ourselves at home, we shall\r\n  endeavour so to arrange matters that everything is comfortable to us,\r\n  down to the furthest manifestations of our existence, so that our\r\n  sitting-room, our bedroom, our house and our garden, constitute =a\r\n  prolongation, an extension of our clothing=” (A. von Eye).[128]\r\n\r\nThus it happens that fashion is concerned, not merely with clothing, but\r\nalso with an abundance of customary details of environment. The\r\narrangement and furnishing of rooms, artistic objects, bodily exercises,\r\nsocial intercourse, sports, etc., are subject to the caprices of\r\nfashion. On this extended idea of fashion is based Fr. Th. Vischer’s\r\ndefinition: “Fashion is a general term to denote a complex of temporary\r\ncurrent forms of civilization.”\r\n\r\nThe =theory= of fashion has been elaborated especially by Sombart[129]\r\nand Simmel.[130] In the work of W. Fred,[131] also, we find some\r\nthoughtful observations.\r\n\r\nAccording to Simmel, fashion fulfils a double task. On the one hand, it\r\nis the imitation of a given example, and thus satisfies the need for\r\nsocial dependence; it leads the individual along the path on which all\r\nare going. But, on the other hand, it satisfies also the need for\r\ndifference, the tendency to differentiation, to variation, to\r\nself-assertion. This fashion effects by means of frequent changes, and\r\nby the fact that first of all it is always a class fashion. The fashions\r\nof the upper classes are distinguished from those of the lower classes,\r\nand are instantly abandoned when the lower classes adopt them. Thus,\r\n=according to Simmel’s definition, fashion is nothing else than a\r\npeculiar form among many forms of life, by means of which the tendency\r\ntowards social equalization is connected with the tendency towards\r\nindividual differentiation and variation to constitute a unitary\r\nactivity=.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, the centre of fashion, the associated work of these two\r\ntendencies may be studied most accurately and purely. We can there\r\nobserve how at first always a portion only of society adopts the\r\nfashion, whilst the commonalty are still only on the way towards its\r\nadoption. If the fashion has become entirely general, if it is followed\r\nwithout exception, it is already over, it is no longer “fashionable,”\r\nbecause this class difference has ceased to exist.\r\n\r\n  “By means of this interplay--between its tendency to general diffusion\r\n  on the one hand, and, on the other, the annihilation of its\r\n  significance which this very diffusion brings about--fashion exercises\r\n  the peculiar charm of the border-line, the charm of simultaneous\r\n  beginning and ending, the charm of that which is at the same time new\r\n  and obsolete” (Simmel).\r\n\r\nIn connexion with this fact we find that from the earliest times the\r\n“=demi-monde=” has always given the impulse to new fashions. Owing to\r\nthe peculiarly uncertain position occupied by this class, everything\r\nconventional, everything long in use, is detested by its members; only\r\nnewness and change are agreeable.\r\n\r\n  “In the continuous endeavour to find new, hitherto unheard-of\r\n  fashions, in the heedlessness with which precisely that which is\r\n  opposed to what has gone before is passionately grasped, there lies an\r\n  æsthetic form of the destructive impulse, which all pariah existences\r\n  appear to possess, so long, at any rate, as they are not completely\r\n  enslaved” (Simmel).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the equalizing tendency of fashion serves delicate,\r\nsensitive natures as a kind of =protection= of their personality, as\r\nSimmel has shown in a masterly manner. To such persons fashion plays the\r\npart, as it were, of a mask.\r\n\r\n  “Thus it is a delicate shame and shyness, lest by a peculiarity in\r\n  outward aspect, some peculiarity of the subjective character might\r\n  perhaps be betrayed, that leads many natures to seek with eagerness\r\n  the concealing equalization of fashion.... It gives a veil and a\r\n  protection to all that lies within, and that thereby becomes more\r\n  perfectly free.”\r\n\r\nThat modern fashion is, for the most part, a child of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, and is most intimately dependent upon the nature of capitalism,\r\nhas been directly proved by W. Sombart. He indicates as a decisive fact\r\nin the process of the formation of fashion the perception that the\r\nparticipation of the consumer is thereby reduced to a minimum, that, on\r\nthe contrary, the driving force in the creation of modern fashion is the\r\ncapitalistic entrepreneur. If, for example, a Parisian cocotte discovers\r\na new style of dress, or if, as the newspapers recently reported, the\r\nKing of England introduces the fashion of a white hat or white shoes for\r\nmen, these actions have, according to Sombart, the character only of\r\nintermediate assistance. The true driving agent for the rapid =general=\r\ndiffusion of fashion, and for the frequent =changes of fashion=, remains\r\nthe capitalistic entrepreneur, the producer, or merchant. Sombart proves\r\nthis convincingly by striking examples. This economic aspect of fashion\r\nmust receive no less consideration than the psychological.\r\n\r\nIf men’s clothing, as we have already said, is, in the gross, far less\r\nsubject to the dominion of fashion than women’s clothing, still recently\r\nefforts have been apparent to simplify women’s clothing also, to make it\r\nindependent of the caprices of fashion, and, above all, to subordinate\r\nit to hygienic principles. It is noteworthy that these efforts proceed\r\nmore particularly from the leaders of the modern woman’s movement, an\r\ninteresting proof of the connexion already alluded to between\r\npersonality and clothing. The more differentiated and the more inwardly\r\nrich the personality, the simpler and more monotonous is the clothing.\r\nTo this extent, therefore, the desire for simplification of feminine\r\nclothing is an entirely logical postulate of the emancipation of women.\r\nBut this demand finds a justification also from the point of view of\r\nhygiene. This fact has been discussed especially by Paul\r\nSchultze-Naumburg in his book on “The Culture of the Feminine Body as\r\nthe Basis of Women’s Clothing” (Leipzig, 1901). He insists above all on\r\nthe =complete abandonment of the corset=, and of the “small waist,” and\r\non a return of women’s clothing to the free, simple outlines of the\r\nantique. He makes, also, very noteworthy observations on the unhygienic\r\nfootgear of both sexes.\r\n\r\nThe idea that woman’s clothing should unconstrainedly represent the form\r\nof her body has been admirably realized in the different varieties of\r\nthe so-called “=reformed dress=.” Not without influence on these\r\ndeserving attempts has been the recognition of the distinguished\r\nsimplicity and hygienic purposefulness of the Japanese women’s clothing.\r\n\r\nFor the present, however, fashion, as of old, remains dominant, and\r\ncelebrates annually its triumph in respect of new discoveries and\r\nrefinements of the dress of women of the world, employing for this\r\npurpose the familiar means of accentuation and disclosure, and of\r\ncoloured and ornamental stimuli. The “woman’s movement” has as yet had\r\nlittle ostensible and practical influence in liberating women’s dress\r\nfrom the all-powerful control of fashion.\r\n\r\nNow that we have considered clothing and fashion in their relations to\r\nthe sexual life, and have learned to understand how they combine in\r\naction as means of sexual stimulation of a peculiar nature, we are in a\r\nposition to grasp the =relations between the sense of shame and nudity=,\r\nas it presents itself to us as a =problem of modern civilization=.\r\n\r\nWhile, as Simmel also maintains, and as we have thoroughly explained\r\nabove, clothing, through the intermediation of fashion, gives rise to\r\nshamelessness as a group manifestation, or, as we are accustomed to say\r\nat the present day, seriously impairs the sense of shame in such a\r\nmanner as would be repelled with disgust if it were adopted by the\r\npersonal choice of an isolated individual,[132] clothing has, on the\r\nother hand, led astray the natural biological sense of shame, since it\r\nis the sole cause of the “exaggerated sense of shame” known as\r\n=prudery=. Prudery recognizes the existence of =clothed= human beings\r\nonly; it will not recognize the existence of naked man; it refuses to\r\nadmit the purely moral-æsthetic influence of natural nudity--to prudery\r\nthis is something immoral and repulsive.\r\n\r\nTo prudery alone we must ascribe the fact that we modern civilized human\r\nbeings have completely lost the taste for natural nudity, and also for\r\nthe natural sense of shame, and thus we show little understanding of the\r\nennobling, civilizing influence of both.\r\n\r\nNatural nudity, the state in which every human being is born into this\r\nworld, not artificial nudity, with its lascivious influence dependent\r\nupon clothing, posture, and gesture, is purely an object of simple\r\ncontemplation for the human being of normal perceptions, who sees in the\r\nunclothed human body precisely the same individual natural object as he\r\nsees in the bodies of other living beings. People, in other respects\r\nextremely prudish, admit this when they have the opportunity--at the\r\npresent day certainly very rare--of seeing completely naked human beings\r\nin natural surroundings, as, for instance, when bathing.\r\n\r\nIt is only when we introduce =intentionally= a sensual or, speaking\r\ngenerally, an artificial influence, that nudity has an effect of\r\nlascivious stimulation. =Prudery is, however, nothing more than such a\r\nway of looking at nudity, with concealed lustful feelings.= The talented\r\nSchleiermacher already recognized this fact. He unmasked prudery as a\r\nlack of the sense of shame, and very clearly pointed out the sexual and\r\nlascivious element which it conceals. In his “Vertrauten Briefen über\r\ndie Lucinde” (edition of K. Gutzkow, Hamburg, 1835, pp. 63-65) we find\r\nthe following beautiful passage:\r\n\r\n  “What, then, shall we think of those who pretend to be in a condition\r\n  of quiet thought and activity, and yet are so intolerably sensitive\r\n  that as a result of the most trivial and most remote impulse, passion\r\n  arises in them, and who believe themselves to be the more fully\r\n  equipped with the sense of shame the more readily they find in\r\n  everything something worthy of suspicion? They do not really find what\r\n  they pretend to find in every occurrence; =it is their own crude lust\r\n  which lies always on the watch=, and springs forward as soon as\r\n  anything shows itself in the distance akin to themselves, and which\r\n  therefore they find it possible to condemn; and they will quickly\r\n  seize an opportunity for blaming anything of which the motives were\r\n  =absolutely blameless=. Ordinarily, indeed, blamelessness appears to\r\n  them a pretence. Youths and maidens are represented as knowing nothing\r\n  as yet of love, but none the less as full of yearnings which every\r\n  moment threaten to break out, and which clutch the slightest\r\n  opportunity in order to grasp the forbidden fruit. But this is absurd.\r\n  True youths and maidens are, indeed, the ideals of this kind of\r\n  modesty, =but in them it takes another form=. Only that which has no\r\n  other purpose than to arouse desire and passion can do them any harm;\r\n  =but why should they not be allowed to learn love and to understand\r\n  Nature, both of which they see everywhere round them=? Why should they\r\n  not, without restraint, understand and enjoy what is thought and said\r\n  about these matters, since in this way so much the less would passion\r\n  be aroused in them? =Such anxious and limited modesty as is at the\r\n  present day characteristic of society is based only upon the\r\n  consciousness of a great and widespread perversity, and upon a deep\r\n  corruption.= What will be the end of all this? If matters were left to\r\n  themselves, they would become worse and worse; when we so persistently\r\n  hunt out that which in reality is =not shameful=, we shall at last\r\n  succeed in finding something immodest in every circle of ideas; and\r\n  finally all conversation and all society must come to an end; we must\r\n  separate the sexes so that they may not look at one another; we must\r\n  introduce monasticism, or even something more severe. But this is not\r\n  to be borne, and it will happen to our society as it happened to our\r\n  wives when morality confined them ever more and more strictly, until\r\n  at last it became improper for them to show the tips of their\r\n  fingers--and then in despair they suddenly turned round, and they\r\n  exposed their necks, their shoulders, and their breasts to the rude\r\n  winds and to lascivious eyes; or, like the caterpillars, they cast off\r\n  their old skin by a predetermined movement. Thus will it be; when\r\n  corruption has reached its climax, and the crude impulses become so\r\n  dominant =that it is no longer possible to keep them within bounds=,\r\n  all these false appearances will break down of themselves, and behind\r\n  them we shall see youthful shamelessness which has long intimately\r\n  entwined itself round the body of society, so that this has become the\r\n  true skin in which society naturally and easily moves. Complete\r\n  corruption and =completed culture, by way of which we return to\r\n  blamelessness=--both of these make an end of prudery.”\r\n\r\nFine words from a theologian! This thoroughly just description of the\r\nnature of prudery and of its dangers should be laid seriously to heart\r\nby our modern theological bigots and moral fanatics. How truly\r\nSchleiermacher has depicted the nature of prudery is shown by the\r\nobservations of the alienist J. L. A. Koch, that it is precisely the\r\nwomen who were formerly prudish and “moral” when they become insane--for\r\nexample, in mania--who are much more shameless than women who in\r\neveryday life had taken a more natural view of sexual relationships.\r\n\r\nThe =eternal concealment= of the most natural things is what first makes\r\nthem appear unnatural, first awakens desire, where otherwise they would\r\nhave been passed by quietly and harmlessly without attention. At the\r\npresent day the natural justifiable sense of shame has been\r\n=intensified= to an unnatural degree, and has been falsified to such an\r\nextent that this exaggeration of the sense of shame, this unceasing\r\nobjective suppression of natural harmless activities and feelings, has\r\nreally increased the hidden desires to an immeasurable degree; it is\r\nthis, in fact, which heaps fuel on the fire of fleshly lust.[133]\r\n\r\nThe genuine, natural, biological sense of shame sets bounds to lust. To\r\nthis shame we owe the ennobling and spiritualizing of the crude sexual\r\nimpulse; it is the preliminary stage to the individualization of that\r\nimpulse. It is intimately related to that voluntary, temporary, and\r\nrelative continence which has so great an importance for the individual\r\nlife. The sense of shame has civilized the sexual impulse without\r\ndenying its essential basis.\r\n\r\nComplete culture returns to complete innocence. It knows no fig-leaves;\r\nit does not go about, as did recently in the Dresden Museum a clergyman\r\naffected with the psychosis of hyper-prudery, knocking off the genital\r\norgans from naked statues; nor does it castrate the human spirit, as we\r\nfind most biographers do even now in the case of the great men whose\r\nlives they describe. It recognizes the sexual as something noble and\r\nnatural.\r\n\r\nThe sense of shame is an inalienable acquirement of civilization; it is\r\nself-respect. But, as Havelock Ellis rightly remarks, in =completely\r\ndeveloped= human beings self-respect keeps a tight rein on any excess of\r\nthe sense of shame. Knowledge and culture give the death-blow to all\r\nfalse prudery. The cultured man looks the natural in the face; he\r\nrecognizes its value and its necessity. To him the sexual is the\r\nindispensable preliminary of life; hence in its essential nature it is\r\nsomething =harmless, wholly comprehensible=; something that must not be\r\nunderrated, but =above all must not be overrated=, as our virtuous\r\nhypocrites and fanatics of prudery invariably overrate it.\r\n\r\nThe true league against immorality is the league against prudery. The\r\napostles of the nude do more service to true morality than the men of\r\nthe “Lex-Heinze,” than those who hold conferences on morality, than the\r\nGerman Christian League of Virtue. A natural conception of the\r\nnude--that is the watchword of the future. This is shown by all the\r\nhygienic, æsthetic, and ethical endeavours of our time.\r\n\r\n  [72] G.

T. Finck, has dealt with this fact in a\r\ncomprehensive work in two volumes.[134] This individual love, containing\r\nthe spiritual elements of all the successive epochs of civilization, he\r\ndenotes by the term “romantic” love, whereas we ourselves generally\r\nunderstand by that term a special variety of the more comprehensive\r\nindividual love.\r\n\r\nEvery one who is interested in the numerous “overtones” of individual\r\nlove will find in Finck’s book a rich, though not very well arranged,\r\nsupply of material.\r\n\r\nIndependently of Finck, I shall endeavour in this chapter to describe\r\nvery briefly the most =important= elements and the developmental phases\r\nof modern love.\r\n\r\nFirst, however, let us consider the “=idealization of the senses=,” this\r\nexpression being used by Georg Hirth to denote the capacity of the\r\nsenses for self-government; for independent feelings of pleasure and\r\npain; for the development of peculiar imaginations, ideas, and talents;\r\nand for the utilization at will of other sensory areas and foci of\r\nimpulse--indeed, of the entire individual--for the purposes of purely\r\nsensual self-command. The lower senses, among which Hirth also reckons\r\nthe sexual impulse, can only be idealized in consequence of the\r\ncentripetal spontaneous activity of the higher senses.[135]\r\n\r\nThis artistic idealization of the senses and impulses also plays an\r\nimportant part in the process of the individualization and\r\nspiritualization of love. The sexual impulse becomes “the source of rich\r\njoys and imaginative tragedy” by means of the “veil of imagination,” the\r\n“heaping up of emotions,” and the “helmet of reason” (Hirth). The libido\r\nsexualis also takes part in the idealization of all the human senses and\r\nimpulses. This is the indispensable preliminary and foundation of the\r\ntransformation of the sexual impulse into love.\r\n\r\nThe first important enrichment of the sexual inclinations by means of a\r\nhigher spiritual, individual element, which continues to-day to form a\r\nconstituent of modern love, is, I consider, the =Platonism= of Greek\r\nantiquity and of the Italian renascence. It is a metaphysic of love\r\nresting upon the individual, æsthetic contemplation of the beloved\r\npersonality.[136] For that is the true sense of “Platonic love.” It\r\nennobles physical love to the heavenly Eros, which is nothing else than\r\nthe idea of =beauty= in the highest sense of the word. Kuno Fischer, in\r\nhis first published writing, “Diotima” (Pforzheim, 1849), has erected a\r\nbeautiful monument in honour of this Platonic love. And did not the\r\nimmortal Darwin restate the thought of Plato, when he described beauty\r\nas the testimony of love? In Platonism, at any rate, is to be found the\r\nfirst intimation of a =higher= individual significance of love. In\r\nDante’s Beatrice, in Petrarch’s Platonic lyrics, this idea is\r\nreillumined after the long night of the middle ages, to shine forth\r\nstill more clearly at the time of the renascence in the new Platonism\r\nand in the cult of the beautiful, thus attaining a much more powerful\r\nindividual colouring than it had among the Greeks.\r\n\r\nIn the sphere of love, as elsewhere, the plastic genius of the Greeks\r\nmanifested itself in the form of peaceful æsthetic contemplation;\r\nromantic individualism, on the other hand, was foreign to the Greek\r\nmind. The latter is a modern sentiment. Jean Paul, in his “Vorschule der\r\nAesthetik” (Hamburg, 1804, vol. i., p. 139), has aptly characterized the\r\ndifference between antique and modern sensibility in the words: “The\r\nplastic sun (of the ancients) illuminates universally, like waking; the\r\nromantic moon (of the moderns) gleams fitfully, like dreams.”\r\n\r\nThese first traces of =romantic-individual= love may be detected already\r\nin Christian medievalism, among the troubadours and the minnesinger. The\r\nheartfelt song, “Thou art mine, I am thine,” gives the clearest\r\nexpression to the individual, purely personal nature of the\r\nlove-relations between man and woman, and discloses also the “romantic”\r\nsentiment, as in “Thou art locked within my heart; lost is the key: now\r\nmust thou stay there for ever,” and discloses the intimate association\r\npeculiar to romanticism between the nature-sense and the feeling of\r\nlove. It is the beloved who first fills for us the joy of summer; her\r\nlove is like the rose. An enormous range is thus opened to the\r\nsubjectivity of this sentiment. The romanticism of the =secret= element\r\nin love is first perceived at this time, and finds perception in the\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n  “No fire, no coal, can burn so hot\r\n   As secret love, of which no one knows anything.”[137]\r\n\r\nThe age of chivalry now arrives, the epoch of =minne=[138] (=love=) and\r\n=gallantry=. What a new and remarkable change in the spiritual\r\nphysiognomy of love! This also has left deep traces in the love of\r\nmodern civilized man; this period represents an important stage in the\r\ndevelopmental history of individual eroticism.\r\n\r\nIn the middle ages the honour of the knight and the love of woman, “the\r\nmost beautiful radiance coming down to us from the life of this\r\nwonderful period,” as Wienberg says, belong together. Since that time\r\nman’s honour has been associated in a peculiar manner with woman’s love.\r\n\r\nBoldly but aptly the far-sighted Herder has described the knightly minne\r\n(love) as a reflex of the Gothic. The same immeasurability of the\r\nimagination, the same indescribable sentiment, constructed the huge\r\ncathedral, and disclosed the unrivalled worth and beauty of the\r\nbeloved--created minne and its outward expression, gallantry.\r\n\r\nIn deifying supplication, the knightly spirit elevated the beautiful sex\r\nto the heavens, =raised woman far above man=, and placed man far beneath\r\nwoman. The knight sacrificed himself for the mistress of his heart,\r\nsubjected himself to her judgment before the _cours d’amour_ (courts of\r\nlove), and in the lists. He became the =slave= of love and of the\r\nbeloved woman; he wore her fetters, he obeyed her slightest nod, he\r\nendured chastisement and pain for her sake. But was this all reality?\r\nWas it not rather pure imagination? There was, indeed, as Johannes\r\nScherr says, a worm at the heart of all this romanticism. The ideal\r\ndeification of woman did not affect a corresponding elevation in her\r\ntrue social position; minne was but too often a mere “pose,” and was\r\noften associated with unbridled sexual licence in relation to women of\r\nlower degrees.\r\n\r\nThe domination of the imaginative element characterized the aberrations\r\nof minne, debasing itself for the honour of the beloved. The masochistic\r\nelement concealed in all love was here for the first time elevated into\r\na system. We shall return to this subject in the chapter on “Masochism.”\r\n\r\nAnd yet there is another side to the matter, and by the spirit of\r\nchivalry there was aroused a nobler view of woman’s nature.\r\n\r\n  “The cause and the secret of this dominance (of women) is this, that\r\n  woman, with her complete, noble womanliness, entered wholly and fully\r\n  into life; that she controlled a kingdom which was hers by right, the\r\n  world of feeling and emotion, but controlled this kingdom and no more.\r\n  As mistress of feeling, as guardian of feeling, she brought poetry\r\n  into life; and into art she brought that lofty impetus, the\r\n  above-described fanciful ideal or feminine tendency, which, when\r\n  observed and perceived, reacts on the emotional mood of the\r\n  observer.”[139]\r\n\r\nTo this time also belongs the development of the =conventional= in the\r\namatory relations of the sexes, which came to be governed by definite\r\nrules; since that time, for example, it has been regarded as improper\r\nand scandalous for an unmarried woman to remain for any considerable\r\ntime alone with a man, a view which has persisted to the present day.\r\nThe social intercourse of the sexes was based upon “=gallantry=” or\r\n“courtesy,” upon a refined behaviour towards “ladies,” regulated by the\r\nlaws of beauty, propriety, and social tact. In the sequel there\r\ndeveloped out of this that exaggerated modern gallantry, characterized\r\nby little real delicacy of feeling, because it exhibits an undertone of\r\ncontempt which makes woman feel only too clearly that she is the\r\nrepresentative of a “weaker,” inferior sex, and is in no way the\r\npossessor of any proper individual, personal value. Intelligent, eminent\r\nwomen have always protested against this modern gallantry. Mantegazza,\r\nin his “Physiology of Woman,” p. 442 (Jena, 1893), ably describes the\r\nhypocrisy underlying this evil form of gallantry.\r\n\r\nThe first intimation of modern individual love is to be found in\r\nShakespeare, to whom love was in general, indeed, only a “superhuman”\r\npassion, something lying beyond good and evil, which seized hold of man\r\nagainst his will; but none the less he embodies in his work the romantic\r\nideal life of his time in feminine characters possessing the fullest\r\nindividuality--as, for example, Ophelia, Miranda, Juliet, Desdemona,\r\nVirginia, Imogen, and Cordelia, whilst in Cleopatra he has described the\r\ndaimonic-bacchantic traits of the love of woman. In Juliet, who sees in\r\n“true love acted simple modesty,” we observe the passionate emotion of\r\nthe primordial natural impulse, and the first awakening of woman as a\r\npersonality.\r\n\r\nFalse gallantry, in association with conventional propriety, both of\r\nwhich were developed to the fullest degree at the Courts of Louis XIV.\r\nand Louis XV., subordinated love to rules, and was very well compatible\r\nwith the most frivolous and epicurean sensual life. And this occurred at\r\nthe expense of deeply-felt natural sentiment, the place of which was\r\ntaken by mere flirtation and coquetry. Here, also, the contempt of woman\r\nclearly shows itself. Especially in regard to this period, the opinion\r\nhas been maintained that the modern Frenchman has never suspected,\r\nunderstood, recognized the divine in woman’s nature. Still, the general\r\ntruth of this assertion is belied by the amatory life of the celebrated\r\nheroines of the salons, such as Du Deffand, Lespinasse, Du Chatelet,\r\nQuinault, and above all of the celebrated Ninon de l’Enclos[140]; and\r\nthe Abbé Prévost, in his immortal “Manon Lescaut,” proved that even in\r\nthat period the indestructible belief in woman persisted, at least as an\r\nideal.\r\n\r\nIt was, in fact, in France that the higher individual love underwent a\r\nnew spiritual enrichment; Rousseau’s “Julie” appeared on the horizon of\r\nLove’s heaven. And in the background was disclosed the German “Werther,”\r\na book strangely influenced by that of Rousseau. The =nature-sense= on\r\nthe one hand, =sentimentality= on the other, are the new elements in the\r\nlove of the period of Héloïse and Werther.\r\n\r\nIn Rousseau’s “New Héloïse,” passionate love and a complete\r\nself-surrender were described without the artificiality, and also\r\nwithout the coquetry and wantonness, of which the literature of the time\r\nwas full. =It was love in a grander style= than people were then\r\naccustomed to see. For this reason, the book constituted a turning-point\r\nin literature. That love is an earnest thing, that it can become “la\r\ngrande affaire de notre vie,” has perhaps never been more deeply and\r\nthoroughly depicted than in the character of “Julie.” In maintaining the\r\nessential purity of the love relationship, when the voice of Nature is\r\nreally expressed therein, Rousseau speaks of the principal theme of his\r\nown life.\r\n\r\n  “Is not true love,” asks Julie, “the chastest of all bonds?... Is not\r\n  love in itself the purest as well as the most magnificent impulse of\r\n  our nature? Does it not despise low and crawling souls, in order to\r\n  inspire only grand and strong souls? And does it not ennoble all\r\n  feeling, does it not double our being and elevate us above ourselves?\r\n  In contrast to social inequalities, the love relationship points to a\r\n  higher law, before which all are equal.”[141]\r\n\r\nThe love of Rousseau is, in fact, not social; it is not a product of\r\ncivilization, but it is a creation of nature; it is one with nature. The\r\nnature-sense and the love-sense are here most intimately associated. And\r\nhe observes both, nature and love, =with feeling=. The _sensibilité de\r\nl’âme_ finds in nature and in love objects of the most glorious delight,\r\nof the sweetest pain, of the most burning tears.\r\n\r\n  “Out of the perceptions of mingled pain and ecstasy which the vision\r\n  of nature, of beauty, or of a fine action, induced in him, he wove the\r\n  web of sensibility with which he enveloped the creatures of his\r\n  imagination. Incessantly thrust back into himself, his heart bleeding\r\n  from wounded friendship or from unrequited love, self-tormentingly\r\n  dissecting his own wishes and illusions, his own faculties and\r\n  impossibilities, he became one of the first heralds of the\r\n  Weltschmerz, of the woes of Werther and René, to which Byron and Heine\r\n  had only to add self-mockery.”[142]\r\n\r\nThe sentimentality of the eighteenth century took its rise in England,\r\nas I have explained at some length in my pseudonymous work, “The Sexual\r\nLife in England,” vol. ii., pp. 95-107 (Berlin, 1903). In that country\r\nit found its most characteristic expression in the romances of\r\nRichardson and Sterne, and in landscape-gardening; but it was by\r\nRousseau and Goethe that for the first time it was really brought into\r\ncontact with the realities of life.\r\n\r\nFor the history of Julie, the history of Werther--this was the history\r\nof all happily or unhappily loving youths and maidens of that day; each\r\nmaiden had her Saint Preux, each youth his Lotte.\r\n\r\nThe profound influence exercised by Rousseau, especially on women, has\r\nbeen described by H. Buffenoir in a very careful study.[143] The\r\nsignificance which “Werther” had for the emotional life of the time has\r\nbeen explained with the most cultivated understanding by Erich Schmidt\r\nin a well-known monograph.[144]\r\n\r\nHe shows that the nature-sense and sentimentality are much more deeply\r\nfelt in Goethe’s “Werther” than in Rousseau’s “Nouvelle Héloïse.”\r\nGoethe himself says in “Wahrheit und Dichtung,” speaking of this\r\npoetical, rational, intimate, and loving absorption into nature:\r\n\r\n  “I endeavoured to separate myself inwardly from everything foreign to\r\n  me, to regard the outward world lovingly, and to allow all beings,\r\n  from the human onwards, to influence me, each in its kind, as deeply\r\n  as was possible. Thus arose a wonderful alliance with the individual\r\n  objects of nature, and an inward harmony, a harmony with the whole; so\r\n  that every change, whether of places and of regions, or of days and\r\n  seasons, or of any possible kind, moved me to my inmost soul. The\r\n  painter’s view became associated with that of the poet; the beautiful\r\n  country landscape through which the friendly river was wandering,\r\n  increased my inclination to solitude, and favoured my quiet attitude\r\n  of contemplation extending itself in every direction.”\r\n\r\nWerther’s feeling for nature is intimately related to his love passion.\r\nThe two harmonize, and each exercises a reciprocal influence upon the\r\nother. Nature is to Werther a second beloved. The youth of nature, the\r\nspring of nature, are also the youth and the spring of his love.\r\n\r\nIn the peculiar association of love with the nature-sense and\r\nsentimentality, which is so characteristic of the time of Julie and\r\nWerther, are to be found the first beginnings of the “=Weltschmerz=,”\r\nwith its erotically significant “ecstasy of sorrow.” The following words\r\nin Goethe’s “Stella” appear to me to bind Weltschmerz and eroticism in\r\nan extremely distinct relationship. Stella says of men:\r\n\r\n  “They make us at once happy and miserable! They fill our heart with\r\n  feelings of bliss! What new, unknown feelings and hopes fill our\r\n  souls, when their stormful passion invades our nerves! How often has\r\n  everything in me trembled and throbbed, =when, in uncontrollable\r\n  tears, he has washed away the sorrows of a world on my breast=! I\r\n  begged him, for God’s sake, to spare himself!--to spare me!--in\r\n  vain!--=into my inmost marrow he fanned the flames which were\r\n  devouring himself=. And thus the girl, from head to foot, became all\r\n  heart, all sentiment.”\r\n\r\nHere we find clearly described the erotic element in mental pain; and we\r\nobserve the remarkable =increase= of passion by means of sorrow, tears,\r\nand a profound perception of the evil of the world. This Weltschmerz\r\nfans the flames of eroticism, increases love, and ultimately gives rise\r\nto a peculiar sense of power; it is, indeed, most frequently in the\r\nfirst bloom of love, in the years of puberty, that its relations with\r\nsexuality are most distinctly manifested. The celebrated alienist Mendel\r\nhas described this almost physiological Weltschmerz of the age of\r\npuberty as “hypo-melancholia.” An indefinite, passionate longing, which\r\nseeks relief in tears, a by no means negligible inclination to\r\nsuicide--of which Werther is the classical exemplar--characterizes this\r\ncondition, which is connected with the complete revolutionizing of the\r\nspiritual and emotional life by means of the sexual. The Weltschmerz of\r\nyouth is a latent sexual sense of power.\r\n\r\nHow the nature-sense and love combine to constitute a perception of\r\nWeltschmerz has been most beautifully expressed by Byron and Heine in\r\ntheir poetry. With quite exceptional clearness, Heine also describes it\r\nin a letter to Friedrich Merckel (written at Nordeney on August 7,\r\n1826), in which he described a nightly recurring scene with a beautiful\r\nwoman on the seashore:\r\n\r\n  “The sea no longer appeared so romantic as before--and yet on its\r\n  strand I had lived through the =sweetest= and most mystically dear\r\n  experience of my life which could ever inspire a poet. The moon seemed\r\n  to wish to show me that in this world happiness yet remained for me.\r\n  We did not speak--it was only a long, profound glance, the moonlight\r\n  supplied the music--as we walked to and fro, I took her hand in mine,\r\n  I felt the secret pressure--my soul trembled and glowed--=afterwards I\r\n  wept=.”\r\n\r\nHow different were these tears from the floods of tears in Miller’s\r\n“Siegwart,” and in other similar productions of the Werther epoch,\r\nwhich, with their weakly sentimentality, their emotionally happy\r\n“sensibility,” had nothing whatever in common with the much more natural\r\nWeltschmerz of Goethe and Heine--more natural because based on a\r\nphysiological foundation.\r\n\r\nIn modern love also, the Weltschmerz continues to live. The only\r\ndifference is that by means of the pessimistic philosophy it has to some\r\nextent obtained a logical foundation. And Nietzsche has shown us the\r\n=force= which lies hidden in this ecstasy of sorrow. Precisely on\r\naccount of the pains of the world, he affirms joyfully life and love.\r\nAnyone who wishes to write the history of Weltschmerz, from a\r\npsychological point of view so profoundly interesting, must not overlook\r\nNietzsche as a most important turning-point in that history.\r\n\r\nThe passion inspired by genius, the excess of vital energy in the “Sturm\r\nund Drang” epoch of German literature, was admirably consistent with\r\nthat genuine, primitive Weltschmerz. Rousseau’s more indeterminate\r\nsensibility had, on the other hand, a more powerful influence upon the\r\nmode of feeling of =romanticism=, and this movement appears more closely\r\nrelated to him than to Goethe.\r\n\r\n=Romantic love= combines the elements of feeling of the previous epochs\r\nin an increased subjectivism. Not nature alone, but history also,\r\nfolk-tales, legends, poetry, and the wonderful secrets of the primeval\r\nage--all these are reflected in romantic love, and awaken singular\r\ndreams and emotions. The “mondbeglänzte Zaubernacht” (“moon-illumined\r\nmagic night”) is much more than a mere feeling of nature; it is the\r\nrecognition of a connexion with the past and with its secret, sweet,\r\nhalf-forgotten stories. Fonqué’s “Undine” is the classical type of all\r\nthis. Romantic love delights in this wonder-mood of the heart; reality\r\nbecomes, as it were, a dream. The obscure, the problematical--these\r\nattract the romanticist. It is for this reason that he loves the night\r\nand the night-mood of nature, rather than the clear daylight. =Moonshine\r\nreverie= is a characteristic trait of romantic love. Everything flows\r\naway into the indeterminate, the cloudy, the boundless. This love knows\r\nno limitation or narrowing, no fetters. It is the sworn enemy of the\r\nconventional, narrow-hearted, philistine morality, and of all\r\nlimitations of personality. In Friedrich Schlegel’s “Lucinde” this most\r\ncelebrated monument of romantic love, the campaign against philistinism,\r\nas the greatest enemy of a free, noble amatory life, is most\r\nenergetically carried on. It is utterly untrue to describe “Lucinde” as\r\na romance in which there is a cult of suggestive nudity--as the poetry\r\nof the flesh. It certainly preaches the free natural conception and\r\nperception of the nude and the sexual, and is a glorious protest against\r\nthe artificial and hypocritical separation of body and soul in love;\r\nbut, on the other side, it unlocks in love the entire kingdom of the\r\nemotional and spiritual life, and discloses its significance for the\r\nindividual man as a free personality.\r\n\r\nMore than Rousseau’s “Julie” and Goethe’s “Werther” is Friedrich\r\nSchlegel’s “Lucinde” the apotheosis of individual love. Romantic love is\r\nthe mirror of personality; it is changeable, filled with the highest\r\nspiritual content, and, above all, like personality, is capable of\r\ndevelopment. In a masterly manner Schlegel has represented the intimate\r\nconnexion between true love and all vital energy. The relations of love\r\nto genius have never before been so admirably described.\r\n\r\n  “Here,” says Karl Gutzkow, “there is no question of artificiality; we\r\n  have to do rather with the yearning of a youth who loves, who sees the\r\n  one and only beloved in many different forms, in the metamorphoses of\r\n  his own ego, which yearns to reconcile egoism and love.”\r\n\r\nSchleiermacher, in his “Confidential Letters regarding Lucinde,” Gutzkow\r\nin his preface to the new edition of this work, and recently H.\r\nMeyer-Benfey,[145] have supplied us with conclusions regarding the true\r\nsignificance of “Lucinde,” conclusions in harmony with our own view.\r\n\r\nWe must allude here to a new element in romantic love, which since that\r\ntime has played an important part in modern eroticism. It is _l’art pour\r\nl’art_ of love, the revelling in pure moods and emotions as the means of\r\nenjoyment. The emotional frequently grows luxuriantly and chokes the\r\nnatural feeling of love. Jean Paul, for example,\r\n\r\n  “regards eroticism purely as a method of cultivation. Human beings are\r\n  not to be actually loved, but are to be used to strike sparks from, by\r\n  which one’s own inward life may be illuminated.... He is the exemplar\r\n  of that artist-love which, vampire-like, drinks the souls of those who\r\n  become its prey. This love sees in the hearts offered to it only the\r\n  stuff for pictures; and in their warm blood it finds only an\r\n  intoxicating, stimulating drink.”[146]\r\n\r\nThis unqualified search for personal emotional experiences in love,\r\nwithout regard to the love-partner, is especially represented in Jean\r\nPaul’s “Titan.”\r\n\r\nWackenroder, in his “Phantasien über die Kunst” (“Imaginative Studies\r\nconcerning Art”), has already warned us of the dangers of this purely\r\nerotic-emotional love. Karl Joel has recently described very vividly how\r\nthe romanticists ultimately reduced all vital relationships to the\r\nemotions of love.[147] This attempt must lead finally to mysticism, the\r\npoetical representative of which is Novalis.\r\n\r\nIt is very interesting to find that all the diverse elements of romantic\r\nlove may also be detected in the latter-day renascence of romanticism.\r\nIn his admirable book on “Nietzsche and Romanticism,” Karl Joel has\r\nclearly shown the existence of this romantic element in modern love,\r\nand, above all, has insisted upon the intimate connexion which the\r\nphilosophy of Nietzsche has with the joy in battle and the vital energy\r\nof the romanticists. Both are apostles of the Dionysiac, not of the\r\nApollinian.[148]\r\n\r\nThis also is the difference by which “romantic” love is distinguished\r\nfrom “=classical=” love--a difference and a distinction which I find\r\nindicated for the first time in Theodor Mundt’s romance “Madelon oder\r\ndie Romantiker in Paris” (Leipzig, 1832).\r\n\r\nThe relevant passage (pp. 9-12) runs as follows:\r\n\r\n  “I am therefore of opinion that there can be a romantic and a\r\n  classical poetry; there are also romantic and classical love; and it\r\n  is only by means of this twofold nature that it is possible to\r\n  discover and understand this contrast in poetry....\r\n\r\n  “This wild and yet so sweet disturbance of the heart, in which love\r\n  subsists, this rejoicing and revelry of the aroused imagination which,\r\n  originated by the charm of the beloved, lead to an intoxication with\r\n  all the sensual dreams of a delightful, ethereal happiness; and as in\r\n  the flower-bud in which a burning ray of sunshine has suddenly\r\n  awakened the impulse to bloom, give rise to the desire and longing of\r\n  sensual impulsion--all these tears and sighs of the lovers, pains and\r\n  joys, this love-happiness and love-misery at the same time, this\r\n  star-flaming night-side of passion, to which after a vagrant drunken\r\n  frenzy, an ice-cold, unwelcome morning follows--all this, my friend,\r\n  is romantic love....\r\n\r\n  “And shall I now describe also =classical= love?... Believe me, there\r\n  are faces which at the very first glance seem to us so trustworthy and\r\n  so near akin, they draw us to them, as if we had spent years with them\r\n  in sympathy, asking for love and receiving love. By the sight of this\r\n  girl’s face there was induced in me so suddenly a sense of peace, such\r\n  as never before in my life had I experienced; and this gentle feeling\r\n  which drew me towards her, I may call true love and true happiness. In\r\n  her loving eyes there glowed no seductive fire, no repellent pride\r\n  like that of our romantic Madelon; in the simple beautiful German\r\n  girl, all is clear and true; out of her gentle features speaks her\r\n  gentle soul; and all for which I have longed in passionate, aberrant\r\n  hours of my life--a definite, unalloyed happiness in existence--seemed\r\n  to me, as I saw her for the very first time, to shine on me out of her\r\n  blue true eyes. My friend, is not that classical love?”\r\n\r\nIt is the Apollinian-Platonic element of modern love which Theodor Mundt\r\nhere describes as “classical” love, and certainly he wrongly places it\r\nbefore romantic love, which is the expression of modern subjectivism and\r\nindividualism. Such classical love found in Goethe’s “Tasso” its most\r\ncomplete representation. Here love was conceived as “possession, which\r\nshould give =peace=”; the beloved being influences after the manner of\r\nan already understood picture. As Kuno Fischer remarks, in the world of\r\nGoethe’s “Tasso” the Platonic Eros is the fashion. Love is here the\r\npure, quiet contemplation of beauty in and with the beloved.\r\n\r\nGretchen and Helena in “Faust” embody very clearly the contrast\r\nbetween romantic and classical love. We find these contrasts united\r\nin Wilhelm Heinse’s celebrated “Ardinghello,” a romance which even\r\nto us at the present day seems so modern. In this work we find the\r\nDionysiac-Faustian impulse of the loving individual, and the\r\nApollinian-artistic contemplation of the loved one, described with equal\r\nmastery.\r\n\r\nIn regard to love, Heinse was the prototype of “=Young Germany=.” And we\r\nare young Germany.\r\n\r\nFor all the problems of amatory life which to-day occupy our minds have\r\nalready been made topics of public discussion by the authors of young\r\nGermany. In young German love-philosophy, the “Knights of the Spirit” as\r\nwell as the “Knights of the Flesh,” come to their full rights. Only the\r\nignorant can regard the so-called “emancipation of the flesh,” the\r\napotheosis of lascivious sensuality, as the sole characteristic of the\r\nefforts and battles of our own time. No, he who wishes to understand\r\nmodern love, in all its =spiritual= manifestations and relationship, let\r\nhim read the writings of young Germany, especially the works of Laube,\r\nGutzkow, Mundt; and also those of Heine, who has a more intimate\r\nrelationship to young Germany than he has to romanticism.\r\n\r\nMore especially Gutzkow,[149] who appears to me the greatest and most\r\ncomprehensive spirit of the young German literature--indeed, of the more\r\nrecent German literature in general--overlooks no single riddle and\r\nproblem of modern eroticism. Of all the writers of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, he has the profoundest knowledge of women. How stimulating are\r\nhis girl characters; how true, notwithstanding their manifoldness!\r\nWally, riding proudly upon a white palfrey, outwardly an image of\r\nbeauty, but, like so many modern emancipated women, inwardly tormented\r\nby the demon of doubt; Seraphine the dreamer, uncertain about herself\r\nand her love, of whom the poet himself later admitted that her character\r\nwas based on reality; Idaline,[150] full of majesty, the ideal “bride of\r\nthe waves,” a typical figure of conventional high life, who yet in\r\nsudden revolution against this conventionalism gives her whole being to\r\na chance love, a love of the moment,[151] which alienates her from her\r\nbetrothed and later husband, and drives her to death; then, again, all\r\nthe brilliant feminine characters in the great romances, “Die Ritter vom\r\nGeiste,” Melanie, Helene, Selma, Pauline, Olga--all are characters\r\nbearing the stamp of reality in their spiritual and emotional life, so\r\nvarious and yet so true, and, above all, in their manifold,\r\ndifferentiated relationships to men, genuinely =modern= women.\r\n\r\nGutzkow was also the first to bring upon the stage the modern woman and\r\nthe problems of modern love, long before the French dramatists and\r\nbefore Ibsen.\r\n\r\nAs Karl Frenzel pointed out as early as 1864, Gutzkow made the stage the\r\nbattlefield of modern ideas. The inward contrasts of love, the\r\npsychological problem of the heart--he first ventured to deal with these\r\nin the dramatic form.\r\n\r\n  “We all of us felt the wounds which ‘the world’ inflicted on Werner;\r\n  we all wandered from the quiet violet, Agathe, to the brilliant rose,\r\n  Sidonie; as in Ottfried, so in ourselves, the love of the heart\r\n  battled with the love of the spirit. Who would admit himself to be so\r\n  miserably poor as never to have revelled, lived, and suffered, in the\r\n  play of these feelings? What wife has not, at least in imagination,\r\n  hesitated for a moment, like Ella Rose, between the lover and the\r\n  husband? Such figures as these bear in themselves the essence of\r\n  truth, and do not lose their lofty value because, perhaps, their\r\n  garments are not draped with sufficient harmony. They touch us,\r\n  because we recognize in them our own flesh and blood; and they fulfil,\r\n  in so far as the form of the society drama allows, Shakespeare’s canon\r\n  of dramatic art--they hold the mirror up to nature.”\r\n\r\nIn his tragedies, “Werner,” “Ottfried,” “Ella Rose,” Gutzkow presents in\r\na masterly manner the inner life of the time; we see in them the pulsing\r\nwing-beats of the souls, which in pain, as it must be in these days,\r\nsoar upwards in the effort to attain beauty and freedom.[152]\r\n\r\nOf all the young German authors, Gutzkow has best grasped the problem of\r\nproblems in love--the problem of =personality=. In the painful question\r\nasked of Helene d’Azimont, in “Die Ritter vom Geiste”--\r\n\r\n  “Is it, then, thy innermost need,\r\n   To be everything to others, =nothing to thyself=?\r\n   Nothing to woman’s highest glory, love,\r\n   Nothing, Helene, to the pang of renunciation?”\r\n\r\n--this inalienable right to the safeguarding and development of the\r\nindividual personality, notwithstanding all the self-sacrifice of\r\npassionate love, is most forcibly maintained. This is, indeed, the true\r\nnucleus of all higher individual love between man and woman.\r\n\r\nGutzkow has been accused, by those who had in mind only the purely\r\nsymbolic nudity scene in “Wally,” of preaching the “emancipation of the\r\nflesh”; the same accusation has been levelled against other young German\r\nauthors, such as Lambe (in “Jungen Europa”), Theodor Mundt (in the\r\n“Madonna”), Wienbarg (in the “Aesthetische Feldzüge”), Heine (in the\r\n“Neue Gedichte”). The charge is unjust. It is only the =poetry= of the\r\nflesh which they wish to bring to its rights. Notwithstanding his\r\nenthusiastic hymn of praise to Casanova, Theodor Mundt declares in his\r\n“Madonna” that the separation of flesh and spirit is the “inexpiable\r\nsuicide of the human consciousness.”\r\n\r\nMuch more important, the true characteristic of all the authors of young\r\nGermany, appear to me the parts which =self-analysis= and =reflection=\r\nhere for the first time play in love, visible beneath the influence of\r\nthe offshoots of French romanticism, in which, however, we also\r\nencounter the same phenomenon, as in George Sand’s “Lelia,” in Alfred de\r\nMusset’s “Confession d’un Enfant du Siècle,” in Balzac’s “Femme de\r\nTrente Ans”--in which last romance we find the following passage:\r\n\r\n  “Love assumes the colouring of every century. Now, in the year 1822,\r\n  it is doctrinaire. Instead of, as formerly, proving it by deeds, it is\r\n  argued, it is discussed, it is brought upon the tribune in a speech.”\r\n\r\n=Just as in the middle ages the idea of “sin” was the disturbing\r\nprinciple of love, so for the modern civilized man, since the days of\r\nyoung Germany, this cold self-reflection, this critical analysis of\r\none’s peculiar passionate perceptions and feelings, is the modern\r\ndisturbing principle.= This is the worm which gnaws unceasingly at the\r\nroot of our love, and destroys its most beautiful blossoms. Gutzkow’s\r\n“Wally the Doubter” and “Seraphine” are the classical literary documents\r\nfor this destructive ascendancy of pure thought in love. Very noteworthy\r\nis it that in both these romances it is =woman= who destroys life and\r\nlove by reflection, whilst from earliest days this danger has always\r\nlain in the path of man. It is the fate of the modern woman, of\r\nindividual personalities, which is here depicted; this fate makes its\r\nappearance from the moment when woman comes to take a share in the\r\nspiritual life of man. The cold dialectic of Seraphine, who, as Gutzkow\r\nmakes one of her lovers say, reverses the natural order of man and\r\nwoman, is a necessary product of the love of woman ripening in the\r\ndirection of a free personality--happily, however, it is only a\r\n=transient= phenomenon. The fully developed personality will return to\r\nthe primitiveness of feeling, and will no longer endure within herself\r\nany kind of division or laceration. The corresponding phenomena in man\r\nhave been described by Kierkegaard and Grillparzer in their diaries,\r\nwhich are classical documents of “reflection-love.”\r\n\r\nThe love of the present day contains within itself, and nourishes itself\r\nupon, all the above-described spiritual elements of the past. More\r\nespecially at the present day is the question of the so-called =free\r\nlove= or =free marriage=, disregardant of the legally binding forms of\r\ncivil and ecclesiastical marriage, representative of all the heartfelt\r\nneeds of highly civilized mankind, hitherto held back, oppressed, and\r\nfettered by the materialism of the time, and still more by its\r\nconventionalism still active beneath its covering of outlived forms. The\r\nproblem of free love was first formulated in “Lucinde,” but found in the\r\nyoung German literature, especially in the writings of Laube, Mundt, and\r\nDingelstedt, its theoretical foundation; and in the Bohemian life of the\r\nSecond Empire free love obtained its practical realization, although the\r\npurely =idyllic= character of this Bohemian life, and its limitation to\r\nthe circle of the _dolce far niente_ students and artists, in truth\r\nmakes it differ widely from the most intensely personal free love,\r\n=taking its part fully in the struggle for life=, as it presents itself\r\nin the ideal form to modern humanity.\r\n\r\nThe Second French Empire, whose significance for the spiritual\r\ntendencies of our time was a very great one, allowed two elements of\r\nlove, to which we have earlier alluded, to appear with marked\r\npredominance--elements still influential at the present day: the\r\n=satanic-diabolic= element of eroticism, which found its most incisive\r\nexpression in the works of Barbey d’Aurevilly (strongly influenced by\r\nthe writings of de Sade), of Baudelaire, and more particularly of the\r\ngreat Félicien Rops; and the purely artistic element, as it appears in\r\nthe works of the authors just mentioned, but more especially in the\r\nwritings of Théophile Gautier. This “Young France” (to use the name of a\r\nnovel of Gautier’s) has influenced the amatory life and the amatory\r\ntheory of the present day almost as strongly as young Germany.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, in the sixties of the nineteenth century\r\nSchopenhauer’s philosophy was dominant in Germany, and his metaphysic\r\nof love, which considered the individual not at all, but the species as\r\nall in all--this =pessimistic= conception of all love found its poetic\r\nexpression in Edward Grisebach’s “New Tanhäuser,” published in 1869.\r\nHere, also, it would be a grave error to condemn these erotic poems of\r\nthe day, on account of their glowing sensuality, as mere glorifications\r\nof carnal lust. The poet himself was the new Tanhäuser. He wished, as he\r\noften told me, to find expression in these poems for the life-denying as\r\nwell as for the life-affirming forces. He sang the pleasure and the\r\npain, the hopes and the disappointments of modern love. For him love is\r\nindeed the rose =with= the thorns. For this reason the motto of the poem\r\nis a saying of Meister Eckart: “The voluptuousness of the creature is\r\nintermingled with bitterness;” and this is the theme of the poets,\r\nthough expressed in numerous variations: “There is no pleasure without\r\nregret.”\r\n\r\nBut for this reason Grisebach--and in this respect he resembles\r\nNietzsche--wished none the less joyfully to affirm this life, filled as\r\nit is with pain, and in all its activity bringing with it regrets. In\r\nthis sense he is no exclusive pessimist, but an apostle of =activity=,\r\nlike the men of young Germany, in whose footsteps, and especially in\r\nthose of Heine, he follows. The beautiful saying of Laube, in his\r\n“Liebesbriefen” (Leipzig, 1835, p. 29), “He who has never been shaken to\r\nthe depths by any profound sorrow is also ignorant of all deep\r\nrejoicing, he knows no single verse of that enthusiasm which woos the\r\ndenied heaven, he experiences no sort of religion, he is capable of no\r\nsacrifice, of no greatness,” is suited also to the “new Tanhäuser,”\r\nwhich so powerfully influenced German youth during the seventies and\r\neighties of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nHe who wishes to understand how the various love-problems are\r\nrepresented in the literature of the present, strongly influenced as it\r\nis by the problem-poems of Ibsen, by Zola’s naturalism, and by the\r\nFrench symbolism[153] dependent on him, will find it described later in\r\na special chapter devoted to love in the literature of to-day.\r\n\r\nIn the following chapter we have to consider one additional influence\r\nwhich is especially apparent in the love and eroticism of the present\r\nday, and possesses great importance for the individualization of love.\r\nThis is the artistic element in modern love.\r\n\r\n  [134] H. T. Finck, “Romantic Love and Personal Beauty.”\r\n\r\n  [135] _Cf._ G. Hirth, “Ways to Freedom,” pp. 468-472 (Munich, 1903).\r\n\r\n  [136] G. Saint-Yves (“La Littérature Amoureuse,” Paris, 1887, p. 25)\r\n  also sees in the æsthetic contemplation of the beloved person the\r\n  fundamental root of individual love. It has gradually developed out of\r\n  the ordinary æsthetic contemplation of nature. An interesting proof of\r\n  this connexion is the Song of Solomon, in which the æsthetic stimuli\r\n  of the beloved one are compared with every possible animate and\r\n  inanimate natural object.\r\n\r\n  [137] _Cf._ regarding the numerous variations of this ancient couplet,\r\n  the interesting account given by Arthur Kopp, “Old Proverbs and\r\n  Popular Rhymes for Loving Hearts,” published in the _Zeitschrift des\r\n  Vereins für Volkskunde_, Heft i., pp. 8, 9 (Berlin, 1902).\r\n\r\n  [138] _Minne_ is an old German word (now obsolete) for _love_, “the\r\n  love of fair women.” The _minnesinger_ were love-singers who sang\r\n  their own compositions to the accompaniment of the music of harp or\r\n  viol--in fact, they were lyric poets. The most flourishing years of\r\n  this art were from about 1170 to 1250; thus the minnesinger were\r\n  contemporary with and closely akin to the Provençal troubadours. But\r\n  the German development was essentially native, and the minnesinger’s\r\n  treatment of love was characterized by a more ideal note than was\r\n  usually attained by the troubadours. A good, though brief, account\r\n  (with a list of authorities) is given of the minnesinger in\r\n  “Chambers’s Encyclopædia.”--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n  [139] Jacob Falke, “The Society of Knighthood in the Epoch of the Cult\r\n  of Women,” p. 49.\r\n\r\n  [140] In her letters (“Letters of Ninon de l’Enclos,” with ten\r\n  etchings by Karl Walser, Berlin, 1906), the deep spiritual\r\n  relationships of love found a classical representation.\r\n\r\n  [141] _Cf._ Harald Höffding, “Rousseau and his Philosophy,” pp. 86, 89\r\n  (Stuttgart, 1897).\r\n\r\n  [142] Emil Du Bois-Reymond, “Frederick II. and Jean Jacques Rousseau.”\r\n\r\n  [143] H.

On\r\nthe contrary, we are now actually engaged in its re-constitution,\r\nreform, and ennoblement. All the tendencies of the time proceed towards\r\nsuch a radical perfectionment of love, towards its free, individual\r\nconfiguration, not by the unchaining of sensuality, but by its\r\nidealization; and when we have once attained a natural view of\r\nsensuality, it loses all its terrors. We fight at first against the\r\nelemental force of the wild impulse, and against the elemental force of\r\nlife-denying asceticism. In this struggle the artistic element in modern\r\nlove plays a notable part. By this we do not signify “sugary”\r\næstheticism, nor yet the completely non-sensual Platonic Eros, but that\r\næsthetic tendency in human love, bringing about an intimate association\r\nof the bodily and spiritual, which W. Bölsche denotes by the term\r\n“rhythmotropism.” It is “an impulsive, forced reaction of the higher\r\nanimal brain to rhythmical beauty,” to which art also owes its origin.\r\nThis æsthetic natural impulse is of great importance to love, as Darwin\r\nrecognized many years ago. It was he who expressed the great thought\r\nthat beauty is love become perceptible.\r\n\r\nThe sexual is in no way hostile to æsthetic contemplation, as the\r\nunhappy Weininger quite erroneously maintained in the confused chapter\r\n“Erotism and Æsthetics” of his book. He curtly denies that sexuality has\r\nany æsthetic value whatever, yet Plato himself deduced from the physical\r\nEros the highest æsthetic contemplation of a spiritual nature. In the\r\nworld of the senses he discovered the reflection of the Divine.\r\n\r\nThe well-known fact that with the awakening of the sexual life,\r\nspiritual creative activity also awakens, and an artistic tendency\r\nbecomes kinetic, that at the time of puberty every youth is a poet,\r\nconfirms the suggested existence of this intimate relationship between\r\nsexual and æsthetic perception.\r\n\r\n  “There appears to me to be no doubt,” says J. Volkelt in his\r\n  “Æsthetics” (vol. i., p. 523; Munich, 1905), “that in the youth or the\r\n  maiden the awakening of sexuality induces an individualization and\r\n  invigoration of artistic perception. Hand in hand with the first love\r\n  of youth, somewhere about the sixteenth or seventeenth year, the\r\n  sense of grace and beauty in the landscape, the appreciation of the\r\n  charm of poetry, painting, and music, are strengthened and refined to\r\n  such a degree, that in comparison with what is now felt, all earlier\r\n  experiences and enjoyments seem to be as nothing.”\r\n\r\nSensuality first gives life colour, brings out the nuances and the finer\r\ntones of feeling, without which life would be tinted a uniform grey,\r\nwould be a monotonous waste, and lacking which the joy of existence and\r\ncreative activity would be annihilated, or, at least, would be reduced\r\nto a minimum. Even the most ideal love must be nourished upon\r\nsensuality, if it is to remain poietic and full of vitality. Of this\r\nAnnette von Droste-Hülshoff is an interesting example--a woman and poet\r\nin whom in other respects sexual influences can have played only a very\r\nmodest part. But she lost on the instant all poetic capacity, all\r\nartistic creative power, when her lover, Lewin Schücking, became engaged\r\nto Louise von Gall. The mere idea of the =possibility= of physical\r\npossession was to her a spur to poetic activity without its being\r\nnecessary for this possibility to be translated into reality. But when\r\nthe possibility was for ever removed, her muse at once became dumb.\r\n\r\nAn absolutely convincing proof of the intimate connexion between\r\nsexuality and æsthetics is the fact that great artists and poets have,\r\nin the majority of cases, possessed thoroughly sensual natures. The\r\npreviously described relationship between the sexual impulse and the\r\npoietic impulse, comprised in the “function impulse” of Santlus, is\r\nespecially manifest in the case of artists. In these artistic natures\r\nthe perceptive æsthetic power is associated with an ardent sensuality,\r\nwhich derives its most powerful impulse directly from the beautiful. We\r\nagree with von Krafft-Ebing when he denies the possibility of genius,\r\nart, and poetry except upon a sexual foundation. We do not believe in a\r\nso-called purely æsthetic contemplation and perception without any\r\nsexual admixture. Even Volkelt, who is inclined to sever art and the\r\nsexual impulse each from the other, is unable to deny the genetic\r\nconnexion between the two. Oskar Bie makes the interesting observation\r\nthat “in æsthetic relationships the cord of the will does not become\r\nthinner to the breaking point, but stronger, until it becomes blind\r\npassion” (_Neue Deutsche Rundschau_, 1894, p. 479). Nietzsche and Guyau\r\nhave also declared themselves opposed to Schopenhauer’s theory regarding\r\nthe absence of a will-element in æsthetic perception. Nietzsche speaks\r\neven of an “æsthetic of the sexual impulse.” Guyau bases his æsthetic\r\nupon the love of life and upon sexual love (“Les Problèmes de\r\nl’Esthétique Contemporaine,” Paris, 1897). Magnus Hirschfeld alludes in\r\nhis “Wesen der Liebe” (“The Nature of Love”), p. 48, to a work by G.\r\nSantayana entitled “The Sense of Beauty,” in which the theory is\r\npropounded that “for human beings the whole of nature is an object of\r\nsexual perception, and it is chiefly in this way that the beauty of\r\nnature is to be explained.” Finally, Gustav Naumann (“Sex and Art:\r\nProlegomena to Physiological Æsthetics,” Leipzig, 1899) says most\r\nconvincingly that the sexual is the =root= of all art, of all æsthetics.\r\n\r\nBut whatever view may be held regarding the relationship between\r\nsexuality and art, it is a quite incontestable fact that our latter-day\r\nlife is characterized by a need “for erotic illusion” (to use the\r\nexpression of Konrad Lange), that the slighter degree of eroticism, as\r\nit exhibits itself in social intercourse between the two sexes, is\r\nprincipally of an artistic nature. I do not speak here merely of the\r\ndance as the artistic transfiguration of the erotic phenomena of\r\ncourtship, or of dress and fashion and the whole _milieu_ as æsthetic\r\nmeans of expression of the personality (as they were described in\r\nearlier pages of this work), but I refer above all to =social\r\nintercourse= as a whole, which to-day represents a free and facile\r\næsthetic element, in which modern love receives its most manifold\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\nEmerson, in his essay on Love, has very beautifully described the\r\nimportance to our civilized life of these slight, imponderable\r\ninfluences of an erotic-æsthetic nature; and Konrad Lange, in his “Wesen\r\nder Kunst” (vol. ii., p. 23; Berlin, 1901), refers the pleasure of\r\nsocial intercourse ultimately to the sexual impulse, even though therein\r\nsensuality is mitigated by illusion and is elevated to a purer sphere.\r\nErotic enjoyment is modified into a “love-play,” sensuality is refined,\r\nspiritualized, dematerialized. It is precisely this æsthetic eroticism\r\nwhich at the present day becomes of increasing importance in the\r\nemotional life of civilized humanity, in the life of those engaged in\r\nthe hard struggle for existence, to whom time and leisure are lacking\r\nfor the “great” love-passion. For such as these, these gentler\r\nsuggestions constitute the true charm of life, into the dreary monotony\r\nof which they bring light and colour.\r\n\r\nIn his excellent “Remarks on Goethe’s Stella,” Wilhelm Scherer has\r\nassigned its true value to this erotic æstheticism and æsthetic\r\neroticism of society and social intercourse. He speaks of a charm of\r\npersonal presence, which brings out all that is best in two human\r\nbeings. He speaks of an enthusiastic and complete surrender of the\r\nspirit and the emotions, in which the souls seem to enter into\r\ninseparable union--and yet only seem. For in reality this surrender\r\noccurs for weeks, for days, for minutes, for moments, and to various\r\npersons. These frequent, individual, purely spiritual contacts between\r\nthe two sexes have completely the character of æsthetic joy; they give\r\nrise to a perception of =freedom=, of liberation from the power of the\r\nsenses. Who does not know the happy freedom of spirit which is aroused\r\nby the glance of a beautiful girl, by the smile of a sympathetic face?\r\n\r\nThis æsthetic incitation by means of eroticism has, moreover, in it\r\nsomething =vitalizing=, something which spurs on the will, because its\r\ncause--eroticism itself--contains within it such an element of action\r\nand vital energy. The modern love ideals of the sexes have a peculiar\r\nimpulsive force. Classical beauty taken by itself, and without the\r\nindividual, personal characteristic element, is valueless. And woman\r\nherself also is no longer the patient Gretchen of yore. She must have\r\ntemperament, character, passion--she must be a personality.\r\n\r\nMore than by the beautiful are we allured by the characteristic, by the\r\ndeveloped personality, by the passionate, the subjective in woman--by\r\nthat which, in pursuance of a false connotation, is often now termed\r\n“nervous” beauty. The pale Josepha of the days of Heine’s boyhood is an\r\nexample of this type.\r\n\r\nIn her “Buch der Frauen” (“Book of Women”) (Paris and Leipzig, 1895),\r\nLaura Marholm has described in the figures of Marie Bashkirtzeff, Anna\r\nCharlotte Loeffler, Eleonore Duse, George Egerton, Amalie Skram, and\r\nSonja Kowalewska, well-marked and characteristic types of modern woman\r\nas a personality.\r\n\r\nThis attraction to the characteristic, to the personal, in the aspect of\r\nwoman conflicts to some extent with the preference arising under the\r\ninfluence of the English “Pre-Raphaelites,” of Burne-Jones and Rossetti,\r\nfor straight lines, for slender, ethereal, unduly spiritual,\r\nsupersensual forms, which no longer express the free personality of the\r\nmature, complete woman, but approximate rather to the infantile, asexual\r\nhabitus. In this case, however, we have to do with a mere transient\r\nfashion, which cannot countervail the above characterized general\r\ntendency towards the personal.\r\n\r\nThis personal, individual has in man even greater importance than actual\r\nbeauty. It is a distinctive fact that, throughout the history of\r\ncivilization, men have always had a clearer understanding of “masculine\r\nbeauty” than women. Women have preferred power, intelligence, energy of\r\nwill, and marked individuality. Caroline Schlegel, in a letter to Luise\r\nGotter, writes of Mirabeau: “Hideous he may have been--he says so\r\nhimself frequently in his letters--but Sophie loved him, =for what women\r\nlove in men is certainly not beauty=” (“Letters of Caroline Schlegel,”\r\nvol. i., p. 93; edited by G. Waitz, Leipzig, 1871). This conception also\r\nelucidates the words in the second part of Goethe’s “Faust”:\r\n\r\n  “Women, accustomed to man’s love,\r\n   Fastidious are they not,\r\n   But cognoscenti;\r\n   And equally with golden-haired swains\r\n   Shall we see black-bristly fauns,\r\n   As opportunity may serve,\r\n   Over their rounded limbs\r\n   Attain rights of possession.”\r\n\r\nIt explains, too, the opinion of Eduard von Hartmann (“Philosophie des\r\nUnbewussten”--“Philosophy of the Unconscious,” p. 205; Berlin, 1874),\r\nthat the most powerful passions are not aroused by the most beautiful,\r\nbut, on the contrary, by the ugliest, individuals. The influence of\r\npowerfully developed individuality is, in fact, notably greater than\r\nthat of physical beauty. The mystic Swedenborg long ago declared that in\r\nman woman desired truth, spiritual significance, not beauty alone.[154]\r\n\r\nHerein we see a suggestion of the fact that true beauty is ultimately\r\nspiritual beauty, the expression of the force of will, of poietic\r\nactivity, and of free personality.\r\n\r\n  [154] “It is by no means rare,” says Lermontoff in “Ein Held unserer\r\n  Zeit” (“A Hero of our own Time”), “for women to love such men to\r\n  distraction, and to be unwilling to exchange their hideousness for the\r\n  beauty of an Endymion.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER

life, after\r\n  Gross-Hoffinger.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nSince the subject first engaged my close attention, it has always seemed\r\nto me incomprehensible that a dispute should ever have arisen among\r\nanthropologists, ethnologists, and historians of civilization as to\r\nwhether, among the primitive forms of the sexual relationship, marriage\r\nwas the first, or whether it was preceded by a state of sexual\r\npromiscuity.\r\n\r\nWhoever knows the nature of the sexual impulse, whoever has arrived at a\r\nclear understanding regarding the course of human evolution, and,\r\nfinally, whoever has studied the conditions that even now prevail, alike\r\namong primitive peoples and among modern civilized races, in the matter\r\nof sexual relations, can have no doubt whatever that =in the beginnings\r\nof human development a state of sexual promiscuity did actually\r\nprevail=.[155]\r\n\r\n  “The ideal goal,” says Heinrich Schurtz, “towards which, more or less\r\n  consciously, civilized humanity is undoubtedly advancing,\r\n  involuntarily also becomes the standard by which the past is judged,\r\n  and sentiment and mood take the place of a single-minded endeavour to\r\n  arrive at truth.”\r\n\r\nThus it has happened that the ideal of permanent marriage between a\r\nsingle man and a single woman, which, in fact, as we shall proceed to\r\nexplain, must persist as =an ideal of civilization never to be lost=,\r\nhas been employed as a standard for the judgment of bygone conditions.\r\nThis error is one into which Westermarck more especially has fallen in\r\nhis “History of Human Marriage” (Jena, 1893)--a work of considerable\r\nvalue from its richness in ethnological detail. Hence Westermarck’s\r\ncriticism of the doctrine of promiscuity, based as it is upon false\r\npremises, “has ultimately remained barren,” as Heinrich Schurtz has\r\nproved.[156] Westermarck, for example, simply ignores the fact that\r\nwithin the group-marriage of sexual associates, within the totem,\r\npromiscuity undoubtedly existed.\r\n\r\nSince, as we shall see, among the tribes and races living in social\r\nunions, sexual promiscuity can be proved to have existed side by side\r\nwith, and commonly in advance of, the development of marriage, it is\r\nindubitable that primitive man, in whom the sexual impulse was still\r\npurely instinctive, had simply no knowledge of “marriage” in the modern\r\nsense of the term. Otherwise, indeed, the “mother-right” would not have\r\nbeen necessary, for matriarchy was the typical expression of the\r\nuncertainty of paternity which resulted from sexual promiscuity.\r\n\r\nThe great freedom of sexual intercourse in primitive times is denoted by\r\nvarious investigators by many different terms; sometimes it is called\r\n“promiscuity,” sometimes “free-love,” sometimes “group-marriage,”\r\n“polyandry,” “polygamy,” “religious and sexual prostitution,” etc. The\r\nclassical works of Bachofen, Bastian, Giraud-Teulon, von Hellwald,\r\nKohler, Friedrich S. Krauss, Lubbock, MacLennan, Morgan, Friedrich\r\nMüller, Post, H. Schurtz, Wilcken, and others, have proved beyond\r\nquestion the existence of this primordial hetairism.\r\n\r\nWhen modern critics at length find it convenient to admit the\r\noverwhelming force of the enormous mass of evidence that has been\r\ncollected concerning this subject, they still exhibit a great dislike to\r\nthe conception and the term sexual “promiscuity,” whereby is understood\r\nthe boundless and indiscriminate intermingling of the sexes. They admit\r\nthe possibility of group-marriage, although this is merely a socially\r\nlimited form of promiscuity; they admit even the existence of polyandry\r\nand polygamy, and of indiscriminate religious prostitution; but they\r\nrefuse to believe in the existence of genuine promiscuity.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, if they only chose to make use of their eyes, they could\r\nobserve sexual promiscuity at the present day among the modern civilized\r\nnations. In certain strata and classes of the population, such an\r\nindiscriminate and unregulated sexual intercourse, in no way leading to\r\nthe formation of enduring relationships, can be observed to-day. Ask a\r\nyoung man, even of the better classes, with how many women he has had\r\nconnexion during a single year--not one of these need have been a\r\nprostitute--and, if he speaks the truth, you will be astounded at the\r\nnumber of the “objects of lust”! This last expression is suitable\r\nenough, because in most cases there is no individual relationship\r\nbetween such casual partners. Ask certain girls also--maidservants, for\r\nexample, or girls engaged in the manufacture of ready-made clothing--and\r\nyou will obtain analogous information regarding the number of their\r\nannual lovers. Phillip Frey (“Der Kampf der Geschlechter”--“The Battle\r\nof the Sexes,” p. 51; Vienna, 1904) bases on similar grounds the\r\nassumption of a primitive sexual promiscuity; he refers especially to\r\nthe condition of the seaports:\r\n\r\n  “Ports in which ocean-going vessels come to harbour are familiar with\r\n  the sexual impulse in its most completely animal form, and devoid of\r\n  every refinement and concealment. We find ourselves transported into\r\n  the depths of an urgent primitiveness and savagery, which gives the\r\n  lie to the advance in civilization, and this will enable us to form a\r\n  clearer idea of the bestial indifference in sexual matters that must\r\n  have obtained amongst the herds of primitive man. Intercourse between\r\n  man and woman promoted by the lust of the moment, dependent solely\r\n  upon reciprocal animal desire, the various male and female individuals\r\n  of the human herd differing too little each from the other to make it\r\n  worth while to strive for permanent rights of possession, the absence\r\n  of any ownership of land amongst those wandering to and fro through\r\n  the primeval forest, the common ownership of children by the herd or\r\n  tribe--that such was the primitive, ape-like condition of the human\r\n  race, one actually inferior to that of many other mammals, is a belief\r\n  amply justified by the polygamous and polyandrous instincts of _homo\r\n  sapiens_, recurring again and again in all the stages of\r\n  civilization.”\r\n\r\nFortunately, ethnology furnishes us with incontrovertible proofs of\r\ngenuine promiscuity.\r\n\r\nOf the Nasomoni in Africa, Herodotus (iv. 172) reports:\r\n\r\n  “When a Nasomonian man takes his first wife, it is the custom that on\r\n  the =first= night the bride should be visited by each of the guests in\r\n  turn, and each one, as he leaves, gives her a present which he had\r\n  brought with him to the house.”\r\n\r\nDiodorus Siculus makes a similar report regarding the inhabitants of the\r\nBalearic Islands (v. 18). Have we not here an echo of primeval custom,\r\nof sexual promiscuity prior to marriage?\r\n\r\nVery interesting are the accounts recently given by Melnikow regarding\r\nthe free sexual relationships customary among the Siberian Buryats.\r\nThere before marriage unregulated sexual intercourse between men and\r\ngirls prevails. This is especially to be observed at festival seasons.\r\nSuch festivals occur usually late in the evening, and can rightly be\r\ncalled “nights of love.” Near the villages bonfires are lighted, round\r\nwhich the men and women dance monotonous dances termed “nadan.” From\r\ntime to time pairs separate from the thousands of dancers, and disappear\r\ninto the darkness; soon they return and resume their place in the dance,\r\nto disappear again by and by into the obscurity; but they are not the\r\nsame couples that disappear each time, =for they continually change\r\npartners=.[157]\r\n\r\nIs this not promiscuity? In a mitigated form we can see the same among\r\nourselves. A case recently came under my notice in which two friends\r\nmade an exchange of their “intimates”; moreover, the “intimacy” in each\r\ncase had been of very brief duration. This, indeed, happened in the full\r\nlight of day; while among the Buryats the darkness concealed a\r\ncompletely indiscriminate promiscuity.\r\n\r\nMarco Polo reports as a remarkable custom of the inhabitants of Thibet,\r\nthat there a man would in no circumstances marry a girl who was a\r\nvirgin, for they say a wife is worth nothing if she has not had\r\nintercourse with men. Girls were offered to the traveller, and he was\r\nexpected to reward the courtesy with a ring or some other trifle, which\r\nthe girl, when she wished to marry, would show as one of her\r\n“love-tokens.” =The more such tokens she possessed, the more she was in\r\nrequest as a wife.=[158]\r\n\r\nFrom New Holland we receive similar reports.\r\n\r\nOf especial importance, as proving the existence of sexual promiscuity,\r\nare the investigations of the student of folk-lore, Friedrich S. Krauss,\r\nregarding the sexual life of the Southern Slavs. Krauss has, indeed,\r\nrendered most valuable aids to the scientific study and anthropological\r\nfoundation of the human sexual life; a place of honour among the\r\nfounders of “anthropologia sexualis” must be given to Krauss, and also\r\nto Bastian, Post, Kohler, Mantegazza, and Ploss-Bartels.\r\n\r\nDr. Krauss first published his pioneer investigations in “Kryptadia,”\r\nvols. vi. and vii. (Paris, 1899 and 1901); but later he founded an\r\nannual for the record of researches into the folk-lore and ethnology of\r\nthe sexual life, entitled “Anthropophyteia: Jahrbuch für folkloristische\r\nErhebungen und Forschungen zur Entwicklungsgeschichte der\r\ngeschlechtlichen Moral”--“Anthropophyteia: Annual for Folk-lorist\r\nInvestigations and Researches in the History of the Evolution of Sexual\r\nMorality.” This has been published now for four years, 1904-1907, Krauss\r\nhaving the co-operation of anthropologists, ethnologists, folk-lorists,\r\nand medical men, such as Thomas Achelis, Iwan Bloch, Franz Boas, Albert\r\nEulenburg, Anton Herrmann, Bernhard Obst, Giuseppe Pitré, Isak\r\nRobinsohn, and Karl von dem Steinen. It constitutes a most important\r\naddition to the hitherto very scanty works for the scientific study of\r\nsexual problems. Later, I shall have occasion to refer again to this\r\nimportant undertaking. Krauss, who, as he himself says, is insensitive\r\nto the romantic appeal of folk-lore, but has an open mind for the\r\nrealities and possibilities of human history, has proved in this\r\npublication the unquestionable existence of sexual promiscuity among the\r\nSouthern Slavs. As he himself declares, such an abundance of trustworthy\r\nproofs, obtained by a professional folk-lorist, regarding the existence\r\nof a form of sexual promiscuity within the narrow sphere of a single\r\ngeographical province of research, has not hitherto been available.\r\n\r\nIt is, moreover, perfectly clear that the human need for sexual variety,\r\nwhich is an established anthropological phenomenon,[159] must in\r\nprimitive times have been much stronger and more unbridled, in\r\nproportion as the whole of life had not hitherto risen above the needs\r\nof purely physical requirements. Since even in our own time, in a state\r\nof the most advanced civilization, after the development of a sexual\r\nmorality penetrating and influencing our entire social life, this\r\nnatural need for variety continues to manifest itself in almost\r\nundiminished strength, we can hardly regard it as necessary to prove\r\nthat in primitive conditions sexual promiscuity was a more original,\r\nand, indeed, a more =natural=, state than marriage.\r\n\r\nFor from the purely =anthropological= standpoint--only from this\r\nstandpoint, since with questions of morality, society, and civilization\r\nwe are not now concerned--permanent marriage appears a thoroughly\r\n=artificial= institution, which even to-day fails to do justice to the\r\nhuman need for sexual variety, since, indeed, vast numbers of men live\r\n_de jure_ monogamously, but _de facto_ polygamously--a fact pointed out\r\nby Schopenhauer. This criticism is, of course, based upon purely\r\nphysical sensual considerations; it does not touch marriage as an ideal\r\nof civilization possessing a =spiritual and moral= content.\r\n\r\nThe other social forms of sexual intercourse, forms whose existence is\r\nadmitted even by the critics of promiscuity, are characterized by\r\nfrequent =changes= in sexual relationships. This is especially true of\r\nthe oldest form of marriage, the so-called “=group-marriage=.”[160]\r\n\r\nGroup-marriage is not a union in marriage of isolated individuals, but\r\nsuch a union between two =tribal groups=, composed respectively of male\r\nand female individuals, a union between the so-called =totems=.\r\n\r\nThe social instinct, the impulse towards companionship, upon which even\r\nto-day the State and the family depend, united mankind at one time into\r\ntribes of a peculiar kind, which felt themselves to constitute single\r\nindividuals, and believed themselves to be inspired by an animal spirit,\r\ntheir protective spirit. Their union was known as the totem.\r\n\r\nGroup-marriage is =the marriage of one totem with another=--that is, the\r\nmen of one totem-group marry the women of another, and _vice versa_. But\r\n=no individual man has any particular wife=. On the contrary, if, for\r\nexample, twenty men of the first totem espoused twenty women of the\r\nsecond totem, then each one of the twenty men had an equivalent share of\r\neach one of the twenty women, and _vice versa_. This was indeed an\r\nadvance over unrestricted sexual promiscuity, limited by no social\r\nforms; but it afforded no possibility of any individual relationships of\r\nlove, it remained promiscuity within narrow bounds. Group-marriages\r\nexist at the present day in Australia in a well-developed form among\r\ncertain tribes; whilst, as an occasional custom, in the form of an\r\nexchange of wives among friends, guests, and relatives, it appears to be\r\nalmost universally diffused throughout Australia. Schurtz regards\r\nAustralian group-marriage as a kind of partial taming of the wild sexual\r\nimpulse.\r\n\r\nWell known is the description of group-marriage in ancient Britain given\r\nby Julius Cæsar: “The husbands possess their wives to the number of ten\r\nor twelve in common, and more especially brothers with brothers, or\r\nparents with children.” Here we have a special variety of\r\ngroup-marriage.\r\n\r\nAccording to Bernhöft, =polyandry= is also to be regarded as the\r\nvestige of a primitive form of group-marriage, arising from a deficiency\r\nof women in a totem, so that one woman was left as the representative of\r\nthe totem married to several husbands. Marshall has, in fact, amongst\r\nthe polyandrous Toda in Southern India, actually observed group-marriage\r\nside by side with polyandry.\r\n\r\nAmong certain Indian tribes we find even at the present day indications\r\nof group-marriage. For example, the husband will have a claim on the\r\nsisters of his wife, or even on her cousins or her aunts, and gradually\r\nhe may marry them. In this case we see that =polygyny= has developed out\r\nof the group-marriage.\r\n\r\nThe widely diffused practice of =wife-lending= and =wife-exchange= is\r\nalso connected with the conditions of group marriage. In Hawaii, in\r\nAustralia, among the Massai and the Herero in South Africa, we encounter\r\nthis custom, but more especially in Angola and at the mouth of the\r\nCongo, also in North-Eastern Asia, and among many tribes of North\r\nAmerican Indians.\r\n\r\nSchurtz points out that similar conditions may arise among European\r\nproletariat in consequence of inadequate housing accommodation.\r\n\r\nIn this state of a somewhat limited promiscuity the only natural tie was\r\nthat between mother and child. The child belonged exclusively to the\r\nmother, and therefore, in the wider sense, belonged to his mother’s\r\ntotem. As Bachofen proved in his celebrated work,[161] in primeval\r\ntimes, and among many primitive tribes even at the present day, the\r\n“=mother-right=” (matriarchy), founded upon purely sensual,\r\nnon-individual relations, was predominant; and only with the appearance\r\nof freer, more spiritual, more individual relations between the sexes\r\n(though this did not necessarily involve the development of monogamy)\r\nwas “mother-right” first superseded by “father-right” (patriarchy).\r\n\r\nThese recent ethnological researches have proved the untenability of\r\nWestermarck’s criticism of the doctrine of promiscuity; it is no longer\r\npossible to doubt the fact of a primitive sex-companionship, taking the\r\nform of a more or less limited promiscuity of sexual intercourse. Ludwig\r\nStein also lays stress on this view.[162] The sexual relationships of\r\nthe primeval hordes were either quite unregulated, or regulated only to\r\na very small extent.\r\n\r\nIn this view of the matter there is nothing in any sense degrading to\r\nthe human race; on the contrary, in the development of individual,\r\nenduring relationships between man and woman out of a condition of\r\nprimitive promiscuity, we see manifested a continuous progression from\r\nlower to higher social forms of the sexual relationships, a gradual\r\nimprovement and ennoblement of these relationships, until the\r\ndevelopment of monogamic marriage (which even to-day is merely an ideal\r\nstate, since the reality does not correspond to it, or the original pure\r\nidea has been falsified and obscured).\r\n\r\nThe transition from matriarchy, resting on a purely natural basis, in\r\nwhich women assumed a leading social position, and often also a leading\r\npolitical position, to patriarchy, in which the spiritual and the\r\nindividual relationships were brought into the foreground, signified a\r\ngreat step forward in the developmental history of marriage. Bachofen\r\nwas the first to recognize the profound importance in the history of\r\ncivilization and for the spiritual and social life of humanity of this\r\ntransition of the mother-right to the father-right, from matriarchy to\r\npatriarchy. Schurtz found the following formula to express the change:\r\n\r\n  “Woman is the central point of the natural groups arising from sexual\r\n  intercourse and reproduction; man, on the other hand, is the creator\r\n  of free forms of society based upon the sympathy of like kinds.”\r\n\r\nThe development of the individual personal marriage is most intimately\r\ndependent upon patriarchy. In this sense, but only in this sense, Eduard\r\nvon Mayer is right when he points to man as the true creator of the\r\nfamily. For under the matriarchal system the “family” was incomplete: it\r\nconsisted only of mother and child. Only with the development of\r\npatriarchy could the family become a complete whole. This patriarchal\r\nfamily, which is also our modern family, is thus “the masculine form of\r\nthe human tendency to social aggregation.”[163]\r\n\r\nThe father-right consisted in the right of the father over the wife and\r\nher children; it was a right of domination acquired by a severe\r\nstruggle. The =rape of women= and =marriage by capture= belong to the\r\nbeginnings of patriarchy; later, when woman, completely enslaved, had\r\nfallen to the position of a mere chattel, =marriage by purchase= was\r\nintroduced. The debased position of women under the domination of the\r\nprimitive father-right can be best studied among the Greeks, where free\r\nsexual relationships were possible only in connexion with hetairæ and\r\nthe love of boys. To the Greeks of classical antiquity the love of boys\r\nwas precisely that which to the modern civilized man hetero-sexual love\r\nis, resting upon the most personal, most individual, most spiritual\r\ncontact and understanding.\r\n\r\nKohler has beautifully described the bright side of the complete and\r\nunrestricted father-right:\r\n\r\n  “Now for the first time the man founds his home; he is the master of\r\n  the domestic herd, he is the priest of sacrifice at the domestic\r\n  altar; his ancestors are present in the spirit; he honours them; the\r\n  house is permeated by them. In his house nothing unclean shall exist;\r\n  he teaches the children propriety and dependence on the family; and\r\n  the wife, at the moment when, as a bride, she crosses the threshold of\r\n  her husband’s house, or is carried across it, gives up her household\r\n  gods; his home is now her home. Now, at the domestic hearth, the\r\n  virtues flourish--those virtues which become the preliminaries of\r\n  national greatness. In the bosom of his family the man gains power,\r\n  which fits him for the most important functions, whether in the life\r\n  of the State or in the life of science; and a township or an\r\n  agricultural community based upon such conditions constitutes the\r\n  necessary foundation upon which to erect the structure of ethical,\r\n  scientific, and political life. The wife passes into the background,\r\n  but in the house she develops new virtues; self-sacrifice to the\r\n  family, a domestic sense, joy in the home, amiability in narrower\r\n  circles, are the bright sides of her influence, for the wife knows how\r\n  to develop everywhere beautiful traits of character, so long as her\r\n  lot is not cast amidst rude or degenerating conditions.”\r\n\r\nThe most ancient form of marriage under the father-right was polygamy,\r\nas, for example, we find it described in the Old Testament. Here we have\r\na typical picture of the patriarchal order of family. The head of the\r\nhouse and of the family has a principal wife for the procreation of\r\nlegitimate issue, but, in addition, numerous concubines. Among the Jews,\r\nthe great stress laid upon father-right gave rise to the so-called\r\n“=Leviratsehe=”--that is to say, a widowed wife was compelled to marry\r\nthe brother of her deceased husband, in order that the race of the dead\r\nman should be continued. Out of this patriarchal polygamy there\r\ngradually arose =monogamic= marriage, which down to the present\r\ntime--let us insist on the matter once for all--has remained an ideal,\r\nnever in reality attained, either by the Greeks or Romans or in the\r\nmodern civilized world. For the modern civilized marriage is mainly a\r\nproduction of the father-right, and stands under the dominion of\r\n“man-made” morality, which, beside monogamy, legally established and\r\nassumed to be binding, tolerates “facultative polygamy”; hence =there is\r\nhere concealed an element of lying and hypocrisy which has rightly\r\nbrought into discredit the modern patriarchal marriage as a conventional\r\nform among those who regard as the true ideal of marriage in the future\r\nthe enduring life in common of two free personalities endowed with equal\r\nrights=.\r\n\r\nHegel, in his celebrated definition of marriage,[164] which he regards\r\nas the embodiment of the reality of the species and as the spiritual\r\nunity of the natural sexes brought about by self-conscious love, as\r\nlegal-moral love, has not done justice to the recognition and\r\ndevelopment of the individuality of =both= parties. The “unity,” the\r\n“one body and one soul,” corresponds indeed to the patriarchal\r\nconception, according to which the woman is completely absorbed into the\r\nman; it does not correspond, however, to the modern idea of individual\r\nmarriage, in which both man and woman are united as free personalities.\r\nThis, as we shall see later, is the meaning of the struggle for\r\n“free-love,” which must not be confused, as, for example, it is confused\r\nby Ludwig Stein (“Beginnings of Civilization,” p. 110), with the\r\nfree-love, the hetairism, of ancient times, or with the simple\r\nextra-conjugal intercourse of the present day.\r\n\r\n=Neither the mother-right alone, nor the father-right alone, is\r\ncompetent to satisfy the ideals of modern civilized human beings, in\r\nrespect of the configuration of the social forms of the amatory life.=\r\nThis is only possible when both forms of right are united in a new form,\r\nby equal rights given to both sexes.[165]\r\n\r\nHence, in association with the endeavour for the free individual\r\ndevelopment of the feminine nature, we find also the tendency to\r\nreintroduce into public life, into true valuation and honour, the\r\nancient conception of the mother-right.\r\n\r\n  “Slowly and gradually,” says Kohler, “has the reawakened idea of the\r\n  mother-right been gnawing with a sharp tooth, now in one way, now in\r\n  another, at the rigid fetters of this system, and has loosened\r\n  them.... =That in this manner woman will attain a worthier position is\r\n  certain.= But the unitary family-sense has long ceased among us to be\r\n  the powerful incentive to action that it is among the purely agnate\r\n  (patriarchal) peoples.... Our own conditions render it possible that\r\n  the institutions of civilization will continue to thrive, even though\r\n  the family tie is no longer tense and exclusive.”\r\n\r\nThe modern civilized man can quietly accustom himself to the idea that\r\nthe old patriarchal family under the dominion of the father-right will\r\ngradually disappear; and that at the same time the patriarchal\r\nconventional marriage of ancient times, still to all appearance so\r\nfirmly established, will be replaced by other, freer forms. The idea of\r\nmarriage, and its value as a form of social life, remains meanwhile\r\nunaffected. It is possible to be a critic of the old, outlived form of\r\nmarriage, without therefore being exposed to the suspicion of wishing to\r\ndispense with the idea of “marriage” altogether. The one-sided,\r\njuristic, political, sacramental, and ecclesiastical conception of the\r\npast does justice neither to the social nor to the individual\r\nsignificance of marriage. He who, like Westermarck, regards monogamic\r\nmarriage as something primitively ordained, as if it were a biological\r\nfact, and denies completely the =development= of that institution out of\r\nlower forms, denies also the possibility of any extensive transformation\r\nof the existing forms of marriage. The common mistake is, to place on\r\nthe one hand monogamy in its most ideal form, that of life-long\r\nmarriage, and on the other hand, the so-called “free love,”\r\nunderstanding by free love completely unregulated extra-conjugal sexual\r\nintercourse. It is not a matter for surprise that, in respect of both of\r\nthese extreme forms of sexual relationship, a pessimistic view should\r\neasily gain ground. According to the point of view, one party will\r\ninsist on the intolerable character, in relation to the need for\r\nindividual freedom and as regards the development of personality, of a\r\nlifelong marriage of duty; whilst the other party will lay stress upon\r\nthe equally great, if not greater, dangers of the unrestrained practice\r\nof extra-conjugal sexual intercourse.\r\n\r\nWith regard to recent views on the marriage problem, the reader will do\r\nwell to consult the thoughtful pamphlet of Gabriele Reuter, “The Problem\r\nof Marriage” (Berlin, 1907). The author points out that there is a\r\n“deep-lying dissatisfaction with the existing marriage conditions, a\r\nyearning and restless need for improvement.” In marriage, she holds, the\r\nbodily and spiritual process of human development is completed in the\r\nmost concentrated manner. As a cause of the numerous unhappy marriages\r\nof our time, she points to the divergencies, so widely manifest at the\r\npresent day, between modes of thought and views of life among members of\r\nthe same strata of society and among those of the same degree of\r\neducation, more especially in religious matters, and she refers also to\r\nexperiments made in respect of new modes of life, such as the woman’s\r\nmovement. According to Gabriele Reuter, the child will become the\r\nregulator of all the changes in the married state which we have to\r\nexpect in the future. As “marriage,” she defines that earnest union\r\nbetween man and woman which is formed for the purpose of a life in\r\ncommon, and with the intention of procreating and bringing up children,\r\nand she regards it as altogether beside the question whether that union\r\nhas been affected with or without civil or ecclesiastical sanction. In\r\ncontrast with this idea of “marriage,” there would be other fugitive or\r\nmore enduring unions, serving only for excitement and sensual enjoyment.\r\nIt is interesting to note that the author recommends to the modern woman\r\n“good-humoured and motherly forbearance” in respect of marital\r\ninfidelity. For a woman’s own good and for that of her children, it is\r\nmore important that her husband should show her love, respect, and\r\nfriendship, than that he should preserve unconditional physical\r\nfaithfulness. But the author here ignores the possibility of venereal\r\ninfection as a result of occasional unfaithfulness, which very seriously\r\nthreatens the well-being of the wife and the children! Very wisely she\r\nadvises a facilitation of divorce. This would not make husband and wife\r\ncareless in their relations one to the other; on the contrary, it would\r\nmake both more careful and thoughtful in the avoidance of anything\r\ncausing pain to one another. The children should always remain with the\r\nmother up to the age of fourteen years. A detailed and valuable account\r\nof the problems of modern marriage will be found also in the work\r\n“Regarding Married Happiness: the Experiences, Reflections, and Advice\r\nof a Physician” (Wiesbaden, 1906).\r\n\r\nFortunately, by the legal introduction of =civil marriage= and of\r\n=divorce= the necessity has now been recognized by the State of leaving\r\nopen for many persons a middle course--one which lies =between= lifelong\r\nmarriage (whose sacramental character is thus abandoned) and free\r\nextra-conjugal sexual intercourse, =and yet maintains the tendency\r\ntowards the ideal of monogamic marriage=.\r\n\r\nThe principle of divorce forms the most important foundation at once for\r\na future reformation of marriage, and for a rational view, one doing\r\nequal justice to the interests of society and those of the individual,\r\nof the relations between man and wife. By the introduction of divorce,\r\nthe State itself has recognized the purely personal character of\r\nconjugal relations, and has admitted that circumstances arise in which\r\nthe marriage ceases to fulfil its aims and becomes injurious to both\r\nparties. =Thus the State has proclaimed the rights of the individual\r\npersonality in the married state.=\r\n\r\nIn the marriage problem, the so-called “=duplex sexual morality=” also\r\nplays an important part--that is to say, the idea that man is by nature\r\ninclined to polygamy, but woman to monogamy. Herein, indeed, the\r\nthoroughly correct idea was dominant that the cohabitation of one woman\r\nwith several men--be it understood we refer to simultaneous\r\ncohabitation--is harmful to the offspring. From this, however, the only\r\npermissible inference is that for the purposes of the procreation of\r\nchildren and of racial hygiene “monogamy” can be demanded of woman on\r\nrationalistic grounds--that is to say, the intercourse of woman should\r\nbe restricted to a single man during such a time and for such a purpose.\r\nBut it is not legitimate from these considerations to deduce the\r\nnecessity of permanent “monandry” for woman.\r\n\r\nI will consider this question somewhat more exactly, and in doing so\r\nwill refer to the interesting essay of Rudolph Eberstadt on “The\r\nEconomic Importance of Sanitary Conditions” in relation to marriage,\r\nbeing the concluding chapter of “Health and Disease in Relation to\r\nMarriage and the Married State,” by Senator and Kaminer (Rebman, 1906),\r\nbecause here we find a very clear recognition of the confusion between\r\nmonogamy and monandry.\r\n\r\nAccording to Eberstadt, there are above all two things characteristic of\r\nmodern civilized marriage--in the first place, the higher rank allotted\r\nto the husband in the married state, and, in the second place, the\r\nincreased demand for prenuptial purity and for conjugal fidelity on the\r\npart of the wife. The husband demands from his wife, in addition to his\r\nown mastership in the married state, also sexual continence before\r\nmarriage and unconditional fidelity during marriage. But the husband\r\ndoes not recognize that corresponding duties are imposed on himself.\r\n\r\nThis difference of judgment regarding extra-conjugal sexual intercourse\r\non the part of husband and wife respectively, depends entirely upon the\r\nperfectly sound experience that =simultaneous= cohabitation on the part\r\nof a woman with several men obscures paternity, and therewith the\r\nfoundations of the family, quite apart from a not uncommon physical\r\ninjury to the child. This =natural= difference between man and woman, in\r\nrespect of sexual intercourse and its consequences, will always endure.\r\nA man can simultaneously cohabit with two women without thereby\r\ninterfering with the formation of a family; but a woman cannot with\r\nsimilar impunity cohabit with two men. It is possible that the demand\r\nfor the virgin intactness of the wife at the time of marriage is based\r\nupon the old experience that by sexual intercourse, and still more by\r\nthe first conception, certain far-reaching specific changes are induced\r\nin the feminine organism, so that the first man impregnates the feminine\r\nbeing for ever in his own sense, and even transmits his influence to\r\nchildren of a second male progenitor. (_Cf._ in this connexion G.\r\nLomer, “Love and Psychosis,” p. 37.)\r\n\r\n  “It is not the brutality of man,” says Eberstadt, “which has imposed a\r\n  higher responsibility upon woman; Nature herself has done this. Nature\r\n  has endowed man and woman differently in respect of the consequences\r\n  of sexual intercourse. The fruit of intercourse is entrusted to the\r\n  woman alone. Now, one who has special responsibilities has also\r\n  special duties. Certain breaches of conjugal responsibility are more\r\n  sternly condemned when committed by the man; certain\r\n  others--especially such as concern care for the offspring--are more\r\n  severely judged in the wife. The relative positions in respect of\r\n  sexual intercourse are different in man and in woman, for reasons\r\n  which are physical and inalterable. Seduction, ill-treatment,\r\n  abandonment of a wife, and adultery, are punished in the husband by\r\n  law and custom. The wife, on the other hand, loses her honour =simply=\r\n  on account of promiscuous and unregulated intercourse, because Nature\r\n  herself forbids this intercourse if the material and spiritual tie\r\n  between mother, father, and child is to persist.”\r\n\r\nIn accordance with these considerations, Eberstadt holds fast to the\r\ndemand for “=monandry=” on the part of the wife; he rejects on principle\r\nthe idea of =sexual= equality between man and wife, and relegates the\r\nprogressive development of marriage exclusively to the =spiritual= and\r\n=moral= provinces.\r\n\r\nAlthough we recognize the general accuracy of this view, and admit that\r\nit is based upon conditions imposed once for all by Nature herself,\r\nstill we are compelled to regard it as too narrow and one-sided, for it\r\ncompletely overlooks the fact that this demand for monandric love on the\r\npart of woman can be fulfilled in association with a freer moulding of\r\nwoman’s amatory life. We need merely think of the often happy marriages\r\nof one woman to =several= men--_nota bene_ in temporal succession--in\r\nwhich marriages perfectly healthy children have been born to different\r\nfathers, in order to see that for the woman of the future a freer\r\nmoulding of the amatory life is also possible, though admittedly within\r\n=narrower= limits than in the case of man. Just as the mastership of the\r\nhusband must give place to an equality of authority on the part of\r\nhusband and wife, considered as two free personalities, so also must the\r\n“duplex morality” undergo a revision in the sense above indicated.\r\n\r\nIn passing, let us remark that all those who proscribe any kind of\r\nextra-conjugal intercourse on the part of woman, and who love to brand\r\nas an “outcast” any woman who indulges in it, should have their\r\nattention directed for a moment to the tremendous fact of politically\r\ntolerated, and even legalized, =prostitution=, which, like a haunting\r\nshadow, accompanies the so-called conventional marriage--a shadow\r\ngrowing ever =larger= the more strictly, exclusively, and narrowly the\r\nidea of this “marriage” is conceived.[166]\r\n\r\nThe civilized ideal of marriage is the lifelong duration of the marriage\r\nbetween two free, independent, mature personalities, who share fully\r\nlove and life, and by a common life-work further their own advantage and\r\nthe well-being of their children. =But this rarely attained ideal of\r\ncivilization in no way excludes other forms of marriage=, which have a\r\nmore transient and temporary character, without thereby doing any harm\r\neither to the individual or to society.\r\n\r\nMore than forty years ago Lecky, the English historian of civilization,\r\nan investigator whom no one can blame, in respect of the tendency of his\r\nwritings, for advancing lax ideas regarding sexual morality or for\r\nadvising libertinage, expressed himself admirably on this subject. In\r\nhis “History of European Morals” he wrote:\r\n\r\n  “In these considerations, we have ample grounds for maintaining that\r\n  the lifelong union of one man and of one woman should be the normal or\r\n  dominant type of intercourse between the sexes. We can prove that it\r\n  is on the whole most conducive to the happiness, and also to the moral\r\n  elevation, of all parties. But beyond this point it would, I conceive,\r\n  be impossible to advance, except by the assistance of a special\r\n  =revelation=! =It by no means follows that because this should be the\r\n  dominant type, it should be the only one, or that the interests of\r\n  society demand that all connexions should be forced into the same\r\n  die.= Connexions, which were confessedly only for a few years, have\r\n  always subsisted side by side with permanent marriages; and in periods\r\n  when public opinion, acquiescing in their propriety, inflicts no\r\n  excommunication on one or both of the parties, when these partners are\r\n  not living the demoralizing and degrading life which accompanies the\r\n  consciousness of guilt, and when proper provision is made for the\r\n  children who are born, it would be, I believe, impossible to prove, by\r\n  the light of simple and unassisted reason, that such connexions should\r\n  be invariably condemned. It is extremely important, both for the\r\n  happiness and for the moral well-being of men, that lifelong unions\r\n  should not be effected simply under the imperious prompting of a blind\r\n  appetite. There are always multitudes who, in the period of their\r\n  lives when their passions are most strong, are incapable of supporting\r\n  children in their own social rank, and who would therefore injure\r\n  society by marrying in it, but are nevertheless perfectly capable of\r\n  securing an honourable career for their illegitimate children in the\r\n  lower social sphere to which these would naturally belong (!). Under\r\n  the conditions I have mentioned these connexions are not injurious,\r\n  but beneficial, to the weaker partner; they soften the differences of\r\n  rank, they stimulate social habits, and they do not produce upon\r\n  character the degrading effect of promiscuous intercourse, or upon\r\n  society the injurious effects of imprudent marriages, one or other of\r\n  which will multiply in their absence. In the immense variety of\r\n  circumstances and characters, cases will always appear in which, on\r\n  utilitarian grounds, they might seem advisable.”\r\n\r\nIn ancient Rome these laxer unions were recognized by law as a form of\r\nmarriage, and this legal recognition protected them, notwithstanding the\r\nunlimited freedom of divorce, from social contempt and stigmatization.\r\n“Concubinage” was such a second kind of marriage, which was thoroughly\r\nrecognized and thoroughly honourable. The _amica convictrix_ or _uxor\r\ngratuita_ was neither a legitimate wife nor simply a mistress; she had\r\nrather the position of women in our own day who have contracted a\r\n“morganatic” marriage, a “left-handed marriage.” The only difference was\r\nthat these ancient unions were more readily dissoluble.\r\n\r\nIt was the Christian dogma and the sacramental and lifelong character of\r\nmarriage which first caused the stamp of infamy to be impressed upon all\r\nother varieties of sexual intercourse. The religious marriage was in its\r\nvery nature indissoluble; indeed, by forbidding mixed marriages\r\n(marriages between Christian and pagan) individual freedom was entirely\r\nprohibited.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with this ancient religious view, the State, by the\r\nintroduction of civil marriage, of mixed marriage (_vide supra_), and of\r\ndivorce, has been compelled to make continually greater concessions to\r\nmodern ideas, and =has already recognized in principle= that marriages\r\nlimited in duration harmonize exceedingly well with the demands of\r\ncivilization; that in general, as Lecky maintained, the recent changes\r\nin economic conditions have a much greater influence upon marriage and\r\nthe forms of marriage than the ecclesiastical and mystical conception of\r\nthe institution.\r\n\r\nAnyone who wishes to gain an insight into this very difficult problem of\r\nmodern marriage must first obtain clear views in respect of certain\r\npeculiarities of individual human love, regarding the intimate connexion\r\nof which with the whole process of mental evolution we have already\r\ndealt in earlier chapters.\r\n\r\nMax Nordau has written a celebrated chapter on “The Lie of\r\nMarriage,”[167] and in the light of reality marriage is, in fact, often\r\nsuch a lie as he describes, especially in view of the fact that not less\r\nthan 75 per cent. of modern marriages are so-called “marriages of\r\nconvenience,” and in no sense are properly love-marriages.[168]\r\n\r\nBut it is a well-known fact that these marriages of reason are often\r\nmore enduring than love-marriages. This depends upon the nature of human\r\nlove, which is by no means inalterable, =but changes in accordance with\r\nthe various developmental phases of the individual, needs new\r\nincitements and new individual relationships=.\r\n\r\nIn No. 14,919 of the _Neue Freie Presse_ of Vienna, March 6, 1906, there\r\nappeared among the advertisements a remarkable question, which was\r\nprobably directed by a betrayed or deceived lover to his beloved:\r\n\r\n  “Ewige Liebe--ewige Lüge?”\r\n\r\n  “Eternal Love--Eternal Lie?”\r\n\r\nLove also, personal love, is transitory, like man himself, like the\r\nisolated individual. It differs in the different ages of life; it\r\ndiffers, too, according to its object for the time being. Eduard von\r\nHartmann calls love a thunderstorm, which does not discharge in a single\r\nflash of lightning, but gradually discharges the electrical energy in\r\nseveral successive flashes, and after the discharge “there comes the\r\ncool wind, the heaven of consciousness clears once more, and we look\r\nround astonished at the fertilizing rain falling on the ground, and at\r\nthe clouds fleeing towards the distant horizon.”\r\n\r\nAll those who are well acquainted with humanity, all poets and\r\npsychologists, are in agreement respecting the fugitive character of\r\nyouthful love. For this reason, they advise against marriage concluded\r\nduring the passion of early youth. This poetry of love at first sight\r\nis, according to Gutzkow, the eternal =game of chance= of our young\r\npeople, in which their health, their life, and their future go to wreck.\r\n\r\nAnother keen observer, Kierkegaard, in his “Diary of a Seducer,” says:\r\n\r\n  “Love has many mysteries, and this first love is also a mystery, if\r\n  not the greatest. Most men in their ardent passion are as if insane;\r\n  they become engaged or commit some other stupidity, and in a moment it\r\n  is all over, and they know once more what it has cost them, what they\r\n  have lost.”\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, a third eminent writer on eroticism, Rétif de la Bretonne,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n  “It is a folly of the same kind to trust the constancy of a young man\r\n  of twenty years of age. At this age it is less a woman that one loves\r\n  than women; one is intoxicated rather by sensual phenomena than by the\r\n  individual, however lovable that individual may be.”\r\n\r\nBut to youth love is almost always no more than a beautiful memory, a\r\nvanishing paradise. There clings to it something imperishable, which\r\nhas, however, no binding force.\r\n\r\nAnd just as to every man the love of youth appears ideal in character,\r\nprecisely because it is not subjected to the rude considerations of\r\nreality, so also in every subsequent love it is almost always the =first\r\nbeginnings= only in which true beauty and deep perception are\r\nexperienced.\r\n\r\n  “A thousand years of tears and pains,” Goethe makes his Stella say,\r\n  “could not counterpoise the happiness of the first glance, the\r\n  trembling, the stammering, the approach and the withdrawal, the\r\n  self-forgetfulness, the first fugitive ardent kiss, and the first\r\n  gently breathing embrace.”\r\n\r\nThe eternal duration of such feelings is contradicted by an\r\nanthropologico-biological phenomenon of human sexuality, which I have\r\ndescribed as “=the need for sexual variety=.”[169] Human love, as a\r\nwhole and in its individual manifestations, is dominated and influenced\r\nby the need for change and variety. Schopenhauer drew attention to this\r\nprimordial and fundamental phenomenon of human love; he was wrong,\r\nhowever, in limiting it to the male sex.[170] As I have already\r\ninsisted, this general human need for variety in sexual relationships is\r\nto be regarded rather as a general =principle of explanation of admitted\r\nfacts=, than as a desirable ideal. On the contrary, in my opinion,\r\nfaithfulness, constancy, and durability in love, bring under control and\r\ndiminish this need for sexual variety, through the recognition of the\r\neminent =advances in civilization= by means of which the human amatory\r\nlife will be further developed and perfected in a higher sense. But the\r\nfacts of daily observation are not to be shuffled out of existence by\r\nany kind of hypocrisy or prudery. They must be faced and dealt with.\r\n\r\nFirst, it is an incontestable fact that the so-called “only” love is one\r\nof the greatest rarities; that, on the contrary, in the life of the\r\nmajority of men and women a frequent repetition and renewal of\r\nlove-sentiments and love-relationships occurs. For the most part these\r\nloves occur at successive intervals. Stiedenroth, in his admirable\r\n“Psychology,” makes the following remarks regarding these successive\r\noutbursts of passion and the transitory character of the feeling of\r\nlove:\r\n\r\n  “Since no two human beings are precisely alike, one will at one time\r\n  love passionately one only; in succession, however, several can be\r\n  loved, and the opinion that one person only can be loved in a lifetime\r\n  originates in rare dreams regarding the ideal, of which a quite false\r\n  representation is made. An object can indeed appear which transcends\r\n  the ideal hitherto conceived; but passion does not need a fully\r\n  developed ideal for its first foundation; it needs merely that which\r\n  in the theory of the feelings has been found to be a necessary\r\n  condition of love. That every love gladly thinks itself immortal, lies\r\n  in the nature of the case, for on account of the overwhelming\r\n  character of the sensations of love, it is impossible to understand\r\n  how they can ever come to an end. Experience, however, teaches us the\r\n  contrary, and insight enables us to recognize the reason.”[171]\r\n\r\nRegarding the frequent occurrence of several love-passions on the part\r\nof the same person, there can be two opinions; but is it possible that\r\nanyone can =simultaneously= be in love with several individuals? I\r\nanswer this question with an unconditional “Yes,” and I agree fully with\r\nMax Nordau when he explains that it is possible to love at the same time\r\nseveral individuals with almost identical tenderness, and that it is not\r\nnecessarily lying when ardent passion for each of them is\r\nexpressed.[172]\r\n\r\nIt is precisely the extraordinarily manifold spiritual differentiation\r\nof modern civilized humanity that gives rise to the possibility of such\r\na simultaneous love for two individuals. Our spiritual nature exhibits\r\nthe most varied colouring. It is difficult always to find the\r\ncorresponding complements in one single individual.\r\n\r\nI ask those who are well acquainted with modern society if they have not\r\nmet men, and women also, who had advanced so far in the adaptation of\r\ntheir love-needs to the anatomical analysis of their psychical life,\r\nthat for the romantic, realistical, æsthetic traits of their nature, for\r\nthe lyrical or dramatic moods of their heart, they demanded\r\ncorrespondingly =different= lovers; and if these several lovers should\r\nencounter each other, and be angry with one another, the one who loved\r\nthem both (or all) would be inclined to cry out in naive astonishment,\r\nlike the heroine in Gutzkow’s “Seraphine,” “Love one another! love one\r\nanother! You are all one, one--=in me=!”\r\n\r\nIn the romance “Leonide,” by Emerentius Scävola, the heroine is at the\r\nsame time the wife of two husbands. Reality also is familiar with double\r\nlove of this kind--for example, in the relationship of the Princess\r\nMelanie Metternich to her husband, the celebrated statesman, and to her\r\nprevious bridegroom, Baron Hügel.[173] Especially frequent is the\r\ngratification of higher ideal needs and of the simple natural impulse,\r\nby means of two different persons. A man can love at the same time a\r\nwoman of genius and a simple child of Nature. In the novel “Double Love”\r\n(1901), Elisar von Kupffer describes the simultaneous love of a learned\r\nman for his extremely intelligent wife and for a buxom servant-girl. A\r\nwell-known example is also the double love of Wieland--the ideal love\r\nfor Sophie Laroche, the frankly sensual love for Christine Hagel. But\r\nnot only do differences of culture, of position, of character, play a\r\npart in such multiple love; the simple difference also of bodily\r\nappearance may lead to such simultaneous attractions; for example, a man\r\nmay love at the same time a brunette and a blonde, an elegant little\r\nsylph and a distinguished presence. This is, however, on the whole, much\r\nrarer than simultaneous attraction to two different spiritual varieties.\r\n\r\nSuch facts as these are not to be employed so much in advocacy of the\r\nmultiplication of love-relationships as for the illustration of the\r\nenormous difficulty in obtaining complete harmony between human beings,\r\nbetween one man and one woman. There remains always a balance of\r\nyearning, which the other does not fulfil; always a balance of striving,\r\nwhich the other is unable to understand. This cannot, however, affect in\r\nthe slightest degree the ideal of the =single love=; on the contrary, it\r\nmakes it stand out all the more brilliantly before our spiritual vision.\r\nIt is rare, like every ideal, and attainable only by few. This rarity of\r\n=complete= love between a man and a woman is dwelt on also by Henry\r\nLaube in his novel “Die Maske,” in which he describes love in all its\r\nmanifoldness and modern distraction.\r\n\r\nSchleiermacher described very strikingly the necessity that exists for\r\nthe repetition and manifoldness of love-perceptions:\r\n\r\n  “Why,” says he, “should it be different with love from what it is in\r\n  every other matter? Is it possible that that which is the highest in\r\n  mankind should be brought at the first time, by the most elementary\r\n  activity, to a perfect conclusion in a single deed? Should we expect\r\n  it to be easier than the simple art of eating and drinking, which the\r\n  child first attempts, and attempts again and again, with unsuitable\r\n  objects and rude experimentation, and with results which, contrary to\r\n  his deserts, are not always unfortunate? In love, also, there is need\r\n  for =preliminary experiments=, leading to no permanent result, from\r\n  which, however, every one carries away something, =in order to make\r\n  the feeling more definite and the prospect of love greater and\r\n  grander=.”[174]\r\n\r\nGeorg Hirth also shows that true mastery of love only becomes possible\r\nby means of repetition. There are ideal masculine and feminine Don Juan\r\nnatures, which are always searching for the genuine, eternal, only love;\r\nas, for example, Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient, wandering perpetually\r\nfrom man to man; or a similar figure, the titular heroine of the romance\r\n“Faustine,” by the Countess Ida Hahn-Hahn. Many, most indeed, of such\r\nnever learn to know true love, because they never find the proper object\r\nof love; and they die, as Rousseau, in his “Confessions,” says so\r\nstrikingly, without ever having loved, eternally torn by the need for\r\nlove, without ever having been able perfectly to satisfy that need.\r\nHappy indeed are those like Karoline, who in Schelling found at length\r\nthe man whose powerful personality fully corresponded to her idea of\r\nlove.\r\n\r\nThe need for such a great and true love remains fixed, notwithstanding\r\nall deceptions, bitternesses, and the sorrows of unsatisfied longing.\r\nLove is, in fact, the human being himself; like the human being, love\r\nhas its development, its impulse towards higher things, towards that\r\nwhich is better. No painful experience can completely annihilate love,\r\nand the need for love. In a beautiful stanza a French poet of the\r\neighteenth century, the Chevalier de Bonnard, has described this\r\nessential permanency of love:\r\n\r\n  “Hélas! pourquoi le souvenir\r\n   De ces erreurs de mon aurore\r\n   Me fait-il pousser un soupir!\r\n   Je dois peut-être aimer encore,\r\n   Ah! si j’aime encore, je sens bien\r\n   Que je serai toujours le même;\r\n   Le temps au cœur ne change rien:\r\n   Eh! n’est-ce pas ainsi qu’on aime?”\r\n\r\nTrue love is the product of the ripest development; it is therefore\r\nrare, and comes late. For this reason, as Nietzsche points out, the time\r\nfor marriage comes much earlier than the time for love. It is by means\r\nof spiritual relationships that love first becomes enduring. Its\r\nprolongation is almost always effected only by an enlargement and\r\nvariation of psychical relationships. Physical relationships alone soon\r\nlose through habituation the stimulus of novelty; whence we explain the\r\nfact that so many husbands, notwithstanding the physical beauty of their\r\nwives, become unfaithful to them, often in favour of much uglier women,\r\nof girls of the lower classes, or even of prostitutes. The de Goncourts\r\nremark in their “Diary” that the beauty which in a _cocotte_ a man will\r\nreward with 100,000 francs, will not in his own wife seem worth 10,000\r\nfrancs--in the wife whom he has married, and who, with her dowry, has\r\nbrought him this magnificent beauty into the bargain. For this reason, a\r\npriest, when a wife complained to him that her husband had begun to get\r\nsomewhat cold in his manner to her, gave the following by no means bad\r\nadvice: “My dear child, the most honourable wife must have in her just a\r\nsuspicion of the demi-mondaine.”\r\n\r\nThe greatest danger for love, a danger which therefore makes its\r\nappearance above all in married life, is the danger of =habituation=.\r\nThis has a double effect. On the one hand, by the mere monotony of\r\neternal repetition, love may become blunted.\r\n\r\n  “It is worth remarking,” says Goethe, “that custom is capable of\r\n  completely replacing passionate love; it demands not so much a\r\n  charming, as a comfortable object; given that, it is invincible.”\r\n\r\nIn the second place, however, custom contradicts the already mentioned\r\nneed for variety, the eternal uniformity of daily companionship puts\r\nlove to sleep, damps its ardour, and even gives rise to a sense of\r\nlatent or open hatred between a married pair. This hatred is observed\r\nmost frequently in love-matches,[175] precisely because here the ideal\r\nis all the more cruelly disturbed by the rude grasp of realities;\r\nespecially if the intimate life in common enfolds a human,\r\nall-too-human, element, and tears away the last ideal veil. With justice\r\nthe common bedroom of a married couple has been called “the slaughter of\r\nlove.”\r\n\r\nA further cause of unhappy marriages is to be found in unfavourable\r\nage-relations of the married couple. The most serious is the premature\r\nentrance upon marriage.\r\n\r\nBefore the introduction of the Civil Code, the age of nubility in the\r\nGerman Empire was attained, in the male sex, with the completion of the\r\ntwentieth, in the female sex with the completion of the sixteenth year\r\nof life. In Prussia a Minister of Justice could give permission to marry\r\nat an even earlier age. According to the Civil Code, men could not marry\r\nuntil they were of full age (twenty-one), and women, as before, not\r\nuntil they were sixteen years of age. Women are able to obtain remission\r\nfrom this restriction, but not men. In special cases, however, a man is\r\nenabled to marry before the age of twenty-one years if the Court of\r\nWardship (_cf._ the English Court of Chancery) declares him to be of\r\nfull age, which the Court has power to do at any time after he is\r\neighteen years of age.\r\n\r\nWhilst, before the year 1900, on the average, there were not as many as\r\n300 men under twenty years who annually contracted marriage with the\r\npermission of the Minister of Justice--already a matter for serious\r\nconsideration--since the introduction of the new Code, by which the\r\nordinary age of nubility for man is raised by one year, =the number of\r\npersons prematurely contracting marriage has exhibited a notable\r\nincrease=. In the year 1900 there were 1,546, and in the year 1901\r\nactually 1,848 young men married before the age of twenty-one years.\r\nThese very early marriages were distributed among all professions, and\r\nalmost all classes of the population.\r\n\r\nThis increase in premature marriages is, speaking generally, a symptom\r\nindicative of the premature awakening of sexuality in our own time, a\r\nphenomenon which we shall discuss more fully later. Such an occurrence\r\nas the elopement of a girl aged fourteen with a boy aged fifteen, the\r\npair having already for some time been engaged in an intimate\r\nlove-relationship, and having finally come to the conclusion that they\r\ncould no longer live apart, is by no means a great rarity.[176] No\r\ndetailed argument is needed to show that persons completely wanting\r\nmental and moral maturity are not suited for marriage, which can only be\r\nregarded as offering some security for endurance and life happiness,\r\nwhen it is the union of two fully-developed personalities. In this\r\nrespect it seems to me that the regulations of the Civil Code are not at\r\npresent sufficiently strict.\r\n\r\nA second notable factor in the causation of unhappy marriages is an\r\nexcessive =difference between the ages= of husband and wife, and in this\r\nrespect it is quite an old experience, that a marked excess of age on\r\nthe part of the husband has a less unfavourable influence than a similar\r\nexcess on the part of the wife. This observation harmonizes with the\r\nfact that men can preserve sexual potency up to the most advanced\r\nage--even in a centenarian active spermatozoa have been found[177]--that\r\nsuch old men can have complete sexual intercourse, and can procreate\r\nchildren; whereas in women, at the age of forty-five to fifty years,\r\nwith the cessation of menstruation the procreative capacity is\r\nextinguished, though not, indeed, the capacity for sexual intercourse\r\nand for voluptuous sensation. Naturally, in this connexion we are not\r\nalluding to quite abnormal cases, such as a premature impotence in the\r\nhusband, or other morbid conditions in either husband or wife. We are\r\nconsidering merely the normal physical difference in age. Metchnikoff\r\nlays great stress upon this physical disharmony between husband and\r\nwife. He insists upon the fact that in the man sexual excitability\r\ngenerally begins much earlier than in woman, and that at a time when the\r\nwoman stands at the acme of her needs the sexual activity in the man has\r\nalready begun to decline; but this is only the case when the husband was\r\nnotably older than the wife when the marriage was contracted. A\r\ndifference of five or ten years in this respect is a small matter; but a\r\ndifference of ten or twenty years may be of serious significance.\r\nGenerally speaking, in the case of marriages which are intended to be of\r\nlifelong duration, the difference of age should never exceed ten years.\r\n\r\nWith increasing civilization, the average age at marriage has\r\ncontinually advanced (in Western Europe the average age at marriage is\r\nfor men twenty-eight to thirty-one years, and for women twenty-three to\r\ntwenty-eight years), whilst the number of persons who do not marry until\r\nlate in life, and of those who do not marry at all, is continually\r\nincreasing. This is partly the result of spiritual differentiation and\r\nof the ever-increasing difficulty in finding a suitable life-partner,\r\nand partly it is the result of the increasing economic difficulty in\r\nproviding for the support of a household.\r\n\r\nSchmoller has calculated that under normal conditions about 50 per\r\ncent.--one-half, that is to say--of the population of the country must\r\nbe either married or widowed. In Europe, however, a much smaller\r\nproportion is in this condition. Thus, taking only persons over fifty\r\nyears of age, in Hungary 3 per cent., in Germany 9 per cent., in\r\nEngland 10 per cent., in Austria 13 per cent., in Switzerland 17 per\r\ncent., were unmarried.\r\n\r\nThe number of married and widowed persons among those over fifty years\r\nof age varies in the different countries between 56 per cent. (in\r\nBelgium) and 76 per cent. (in Hungary). In England, in the years 1886 to\r\n1890, the number was 60 per cent., in Germany 61 per cent., in the\r\nUnited States 62 per cent., in France 64 per cent. If we enumerate the\r\nmarried only, excluding the widowed, we find 8 or 10 per cent. fewer.\r\nWhen we compare the number of married with the entire population, we\r\nfind, instead of the above-mentioned 50 per cent., no more than 37 to 39\r\nper cent. And this percentage appears likely to undergo a continual\r\nfurther decline. We must, at any rate, in the future reckon with this\r\nfact, although, of course, isolated oscillations in the marriage\r\nfrequency may continue to occur. In these oscillations =economic= and\r\n=domestic= factors play a great part.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, quite erroneous to regard our own time as one especially\r\ncharacterized by “=mercenary marriages=,” one in which the union between\r\nman and wife has become a simple affair of commerce. There are not\r\nwanting reformers who attribute to mammonism all the blame for the\r\ndisordered love-life of the present day, and who describe very vividly\r\nand dramatically Amor’s dance round the golden calf.\r\n\r\nThe facts of the history of civilization and folk-lore completely\r\ncontradict the view that this mammonistic character of marriage is a\r\nproduct of our modern civilization. It is, on the contrary, a =vestige=\r\nof early primitive civilization, in which economic factors always had a\r\nfar greater importance for marriage than spiritual sympathies. Thus,\r\nHeinrich Schurtz proves that among the majority of savage races marriage\r\nis rather an affair of business than of inclination. And where are money\r\nmarriages more frequent than they are among our sturdy German peasants,\r\nwith whom everything conventional has the freest possible play?[178]\r\n\r\nIt is first the higher, refined spiritual civilization which brings with\r\nit a higher conception of marriage as the realization of the ideal,\r\nindividual only-love. As Ludwig Stein justly remarks:\r\n\r\n  “It was not in our own time that marriage first began to degenerate to\r\n  the level of an economic idea. The converse, indeed, is true; the\r\n  economic background of marriage, as it so clearly manifests itself\r\n  among savage races, =first began to disappear in the course of the\r\n  development of our own system of civilization, and therewith began\r\n  also the liberation of mankind from the burden of metallic\r\n  shackles=.”[179]\r\n\r\nAt the same time, it cannot be denied that even at the present day the\r\neconomic factor plays a very extensive part in the determination of\r\nmarriage, although certainly not to the degree maintained by Buckle, who\r\nheld that there was a fixed and definite relationship between the number\r\nof marriages and the price of corn.[180] Beyond question, economic\r\nconsiderations have a great influence upon the frequency of marriage.\r\nMany marriages, even to-day, are purely mercenary marriages; but still\r\nat the present time the qualities of intellect and emotion, quite apart\r\nfrom physical characteristics, have at least an equal share in the\r\nproduction of marriage. Only among the classes who feel it their duty to\r\nkeep up a particular kind of appearance, among the upper-middle classes,\r\nthe aristocracy, and among officers in the army, is the economic\r\nquestion the main determining influence in marriage. Well known, also,\r\nis the predominance of mercenary marriages among the Jews.\r\n\r\nOne may be an enemy of mammonism, and still see the necessity for an\r\neconomic regulation of conjugal relations in view of the expected\r\noffspring, of the altered conditions of life, of the increase in the\r\nhousehold, and of the necessity for safeguarding personal independence\r\nand free development. Such economic considerations can harmonize\r\nperfectly with the demand for personal sympathy, and with the most\r\nintimate physical and spiritual harmony between husband and wife.\r\n\r\nSchmoller rightly places the most important advance of the modern family\r\nin this, that it becomes more and more transformed from a productive and\r\nbusiness institute into an institute of moral life in common; that by\r\nthe =limitation= of its economic purposes the nobler ideal must become\r\nmore predominant, and the family become a richer soil for the\r\ncultivation of sympathetic sentiments.[181]\r\n\r\nMore especially among the upper classes of modern European and American\r\nsociety is there apparent an increasing disinclination to marriage, or,\r\nto employ a phrase of the moral statistician Drobisch, there is a\r\ndecline in the intensity of the marriage impulse. Although the often\r\nburning money question no doubt plays its part, that part is, on the\r\nwhole, much smaller than the part played by the ever-increasing\r\ndifficulties of individual spiritual harmony, difficulties dependent on\r\ndifferences in age, character, education, views of life, and individual\r\ndevelopment during marriage. This disinclination to marry is nourished\r\nby certain tendencies of the time to be subsequently described, and by\r\ncertain changes in the relations between the sexes.\r\n\r\nTo many also the idea of “=conjugal rights=,” as established by law,\r\nappears a horrible compulsion, an assignment to physical and spiritual\r\nprostitution. The modern consciousness of free personality, in fact, no\r\nlonger harmonizes with that stoical conception of duty in marriage such\r\nas, for example, is described by B. Chateaubriand in his memoirs,\r\nalthough, of course, every one who enters on marriage ought to be aware\r\nthat by doing so he assigns to the other party certain rights, the\r\nnon-fulfilment of which actually destroys the character and the idea of\r\nmarriage. Thus, the conduct of a schoolmistress of Berlin, who\r\npersistently refused physical surrender to her husband, on the ground\r\nthat she had wished merely to contract an “ideal” marriage (of the same\r\nkind as the mystical “reformed marriage” of the American woman Alice\r\nStockham), demands emphatic condemnation. But an abominable =misuse= of\r\n“conjugal rights” is unquestionably made by inconsiderate husbands, who\r\ndemand from their wives unlimited, excessively frequent, gratification\r\nof their sexual desire, without any regard to the wife’s physical and\r\nspiritual condition at the time. That in this respect the idea of\r\n“conjugal rights” is greatly in need of revision has been convincingly\r\nproved by Dorothee Goebeler in an essay entitled “Conjugal Rights,”\r\npublished in the _Welt am Montag_ of August 6, 1906.\r\n\r\nToo frequently, also, it happens that the husband simply transfers into\r\nhis married life previous customs of extra-conjugal sexual intercourse,\r\nand makes use in marriage of the experience he has gained in intercourse\r\nwith prostitutes or with priestesses of the love of the moment; he\r\ntreats his wife as an object of sensual lust, without paying any regard\r\nto her individuality and to her more delicate erotic needs.\r\n\r\nThis physical dissonance is not even the worst. Too often it is simply\r\nboredom which kills love in married life. Like Nora in “A Dolls’ House,”\r\none waits for the “wonderful,” and the wonderful does not happen.\r\nInstead of this the years pass by; sexual passion, greatly influenced as\r\nit is by the spiritual environment, gradually disappears, and with it\r\ndisappears also the last possibility of spiritual sympathy. Thus, the\r\ncharacter of most marriages is =solitude=. They represent the tragedy\r\nof desolation, of the eternal self-seeking of husband and wife.\r\n\r\nWhat disastrous consequences, finally, may result from the part played\r\nin marriage by =disease=, what tragic conflicts may here rise, can be\r\nstudied in the great book “Health and Disease in Relation to Marriage\r\nand the Married State” (Rebman, 1906), an encyclopædic work edited by H.\r\nSenator and S. Kaminer, discussing in detail the relation between\r\ndisorders of health and the married state.\r\n\r\nThe calamities of modern marriage are strikingly illuminated in the\r\nfollowing psychologically interesting account given by the alienist\r\nHeinrich Laehr (“Concerning Insanity and Lunatic Asylums,” p. 44 _et\r\nseq._; Halle, 1852):\r\n\r\n  “How, as a matter of fact, do marriages come about? In heaven\r\n  certainly a very small number indeed, if by that phrase we understand\r\n  marriages undertaken with the full understanding of the nature of the\r\n  sacrifice involved, under the impulsion of an inner necessity, and\r\n  based upon deep mutual inclination founded upon self-respect and\r\n  respect for each other; in social circles, and not in heaven, on the\r\n  other hand, the majority of marriages are made. The question upon\r\n  which ultimately so many marriages depend is, what each will gain by\r\n  it, whilst inner sensations and mutual liking are regarded as\r\n  subordinate matters.... A man is fully informed about such matters in\r\n  early years; a woman is full of dark perceptions, uncertain as to what\r\n  she is to receive and what she is to give. She is naturally impelled\r\n  by her sense of inward weakness to yield to anyone more powerful than\r\n  herself, and, in the intoxication of sensual excitement, under\r\n  conditions in which both, in order to please, tend to show the best\r\n  side only to each other, she is far less able than man to weigh\r\n  beforehand the significance of such a step. Later, indeed, when, in\r\n  the trodden path of marriage, the current of love runs more slowly,\r\n  her eyes are opened, naked reality takes the place of the pictures of\r\n  imagination, which formerly caused self-deception, and what appeared\r\n  to be love, but was not love, takes flight for ever. What has not been\r\n  hidden under the name of love! It conceals the pretence of egoistic\r\n  impulses, vanity it may be, the life of pleasure, avarice, indolence;\r\n  and what a number of marriages are entered into on the part of the\r\n  woman in order to escape from the oppression of repugnant domestic\r\n  conditions, because the imagined future appears to them more pleasant\r\n  in contrast with the actual present.\r\n\r\n  “There are in the course of marriage so many periods of misunderstood\r\n  depression, sadness, trouble; and mankind so readily forgets the\r\n  golden rule, that these periods have to be got through by means of\r\n  mutual aid, and that in married life husband and wife should do all\r\n  that is possible to help one another onwards, and not to thrust one\r\n  another back--so easily is this forgotten, that only too readily the\r\n  mirth and gladness with which married life was begun vanish away. The\r\n  intense pain which attacks us with violence, but only at long\r\n  intervals, has a far less depressing influence on our organism than\r\n  much less severe, but frequently repeated, emotional disturbances,\r\n  especially such as arise out of the wretchedness of life. They give\r\n  rise in us to irritability of the nervous system, by which\r\n  sensitiveness is increased; and repeated misunderstandings in married\r\n  life soon make both husband and wife feel that marriage is rather a\r\n  burden than a joy.”\r\n\r\nThat women as well as men recognize the danger to love entailed by\r\nmarriage is shown by Frieda von Bülow in “Einsame Frauen,” pp. 93, 94\r\n(1897):\r\n\r\n  “During this period I have often considered the question of such\r\n  continued life in common. Is it not inevitable that this unceasing,\r\n  intimate association must always give rise to mutual hatred? Husband\r\n  and wife learn to know one another through and through. The veil of\r\n  white lies which plays so important a part in ordinary social\r\n  intercourse is here impossible. The characters are seen naked in all\r\n  their weakness, all their incapacity for love, all their vanity, all\r\n  their egoism. In such circumstances, phrases intended to conceal\r\n  appear simply untruths, and instead of producing illusion they repel.\r\n  Just as in the first awakening of love, all the powers of the soul are\r\n  directed towards the discovery of the excellences of the beloved one,\r\n  so here the soul is for ever upon a voyage of discovery seeking for\r\n  faults. In both cases alike, a sufficiency of that which one seeks is\r\n  found.”\r\n\r\nThe poets also give us an insight into the depths of the eternal\r\ncontradiction between love and marriage. Who does not know the saying of\r\nthe idealistic and optimistic Schiller: “Mit dem Gürtel, mit dem\r\nSchleier reisst der schöne Wahn entzwei”--“With the girdle, with the\r\nveil (of marriage), the beautiful illusion is torn to pieces”? Consider,\r\nalso, the horribly clear characterization of the pessimistic Byron (in\r\n“Don Juan,” canto iii., stanzas 5-8):\r\n\r\n  V.\r\n\r\n  “’Tis melancholy, and a fearful sign\r\n   Of human frailty, folly, also crime,\r\n   That love and marriage rarely can combine,\r\n     Although they both are born in the same clime.\r\n   Marriage from love, like vinegar from wine--\r\n     A sad, sour, sober beverage--by time\r\n   Is sharpen’d from its high, celestial flavour,\r\n   Down to a very homely household savour.\r\n\r\n  VI.\r\n\r\n  “There’s something of antipathy, as ’twere,\r\n     Between their present and their future state;\r\n   A kind of flattery that’s hardly fair\r\n     Is used until the truth arrives too late--\r\n   Yet what can people do, except despair?\r\n     The same things change their names at such a rate;\r\n   For instance--passion in a lover’s glorious,\r\n   But in a husband is pronounced uxorious.\r\n\r\n  VII.\r\n\r\n  “Men grow ashamed of being so very fond;\r\n     They sometimes also get a little tired\r\n   (But that, of course, is rare), and then despond;\r\n     The same things cannot always be admired,\r\n   Yet ’tis “so nominated in the bond,”\r\n     That both are tied till one shall have expired.\r\n   Sad thought! to lose the spouse that was adorning\r\n   Our days, and put one’s servants into mourning.\r\n\r\n  VIII.\r\n\r\n  “There’s doubtless something in domestic doings,\r\n     Which forms, in fact, true love’s antithesis;\r\n   Romances paint at full length people’s wooings,\r\n     But only give a bust of marriages;\r\n   For no one cares for matrimonial cooings,\r\n     There’s nothing wrong in a connubial kiss.\r\n   Think you, if Laura had been Petrarch’s wife,\r\n   He would have written sonnets all his life?”\r\n\r\nIt is significant that those who most praise marriage are young people\r\nwho do not know marriage from experience, but have failed to find true\r\nhappiness in celibacy. We think of the words of Socrates, that it is a\r\nmatter of indifference whether a man marries or does not marry, for in\r\neither case he will regret it.\r\n\r\nOur own time is certainly characterized by hostility to marriage. It is\r\nthe =form= of modern marriage which frightens most people; the\r\ncompulsion which has actually been rendered more stringent by the new\r\nCivil Code of 1900. Modern individualism draws back from the undeniable\r\n=loss of freedom= which legal marriage entails. The shadow which,\r\naccording to a saying of E. Dühring, indissoluble marriage has thrown\r\nupon love and upon the nobler aspects of the sexual life, is darker\r\nto-day than ever before.\r\n\r\nHence the growing disinclination to marry, which, significantly enough,\r\nis increasingly manifest upon the part of women; hence, above all, the\r\n=extraordinary increase in divorce=.\r\n\r\nAccording to a statement in the _Vossische Zeitung_ (No. 137, March 22,\r\n1906), the number of divorces in Germany underwent a =marked= increase\r\nin the year 1904. In that year there were 10,882 divorces; in 1903,\r\n9,932; in 1902, 9,074; thus in the year 1904 there was an increase of\r\n590, or 9·6 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn the closing years of the nineteenth century, a marked increase in the\r\nnumber of divorces was already discernible. For instance, in the years\r\n1894-1899 the number rose from 7,502 to 9,433. It was at that time\r\nbelieved that the increase depended upon the fact that in most of the\r\ncountries of the German Confederation the new Civil Code made divorce\r\nmore difficult, and that for this reason as many people as possible were\r\nseeking divorce before the new Code came into action. It is true that\r\nthe number of divorces diminished after the Civil Code passed into\r\noperation. In the year 1900 the divorces numbered 7,922, and in the year\r\n1901, 7,892. =Since then, however, there has once more been a marked\r\nincrease=, so that =the figure for the year 1904 is 2,990 in excess of\r\nthat for the year 1901, an increase of 38 per cent=. This increase is\r\nprincipally to be referred to the fact that the so-called =relative\r\ngrounds for divorce=, enumerated in § 1568 of the Civil Code,[182]\r\nappear to have justified a great number of demands for divorce. The\r\nmarked extensibility of the sections of this paragraph leaves the judge\r\nvery wide discretion in its application.\r\n\r\nTo what an extent the increase in the number of divorces influences the\r\nexisting marriages is seen as soon as we compare the number of divorces\r\nwith the number of marriages. It appears that in the years 1900 and\r\n1901, for every 10,000 marriages, there were 8·1 divorces; in 1902, 9·3\r\ndivorces; in 1903, 10·1 divorces; and in 1904, 11·1 divorces. Thus in\r\nthe year 1904, there were 3 more divorces per 10,000 marriages than in\r\nthe year 1901.\r\n\r\nI have already referred to the enormous importance of divorce in\r\nrelation to the recognition on the part of the State of the temporary\r\ncharacter of every marriage, whereby, in principle, free love, which is\r\nno more than a temporary marriage, receives a civil justification, and\r\nis legitimized. This fact stands out still more clearly when we\r\nrecognize the legal possibility of =repeated= divorces on the part of\r\none and the same person. Numerous actual examples of this can be given.\r\nThus a well-known author was divorced no less than =four= times, and of\r\nhis four wives one, on her side, had been divorced by other men. Two\r\ndivorces on both sides are by no means rare. If we consider the matter\r\nopenly and unemotionally, it must be admitted that this is nothing else\r\nthan the much-opposed “free love,” the bugbear of all honest\r\nPhilistines, =a free love which has already received the official\r\nsanction of the State=.\r\n\r\nWhen four or five divorces are possible to the same individual by\r\nofficial decree, when, that is to say, this procedure has received civil\r\nsanction, the number may for theoretical purposes be multiplied at\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\nHe who knows human nature, he who knows that the consciousness of\r\nfreedom in mature human beings--and only such should enter upon\r\nmarriage--strengthens and confirms the =consciousness of duty=--such a\r\none need not fear the introduction of free marriage. On the contrary, it\r\nmay be assumed that divorces would be far less common than they are in\r\nthe case of coercive marriage.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Civil Code, divorces are obtainable on the ground of\r\nadultery, hazard to life, malicious abandonment, ill-treatment, mental\r\ndisorder, legally punishable offences, dishonourable and immoral\r\nconduct, serious disregard of conjugal duties. As we saw, the last\r\nclause empowered the judge in difficult cases, by a humane, reasonable\r\ninterpretation of the idea “disregard of conjugal duties,” to pronounce\r\na divorce. It is obvious that in every divorce the interests of the\r\n=children= of the marriage (if any) must be especially safeguarded.\r\n\r\nMarriage in France, to which hitherto the clauses of the Code Napoléon,\r\nanalogous to those of our Civil Code, have been applicable, is said to\r\nhave recently undergone reform, both in respect of moral and of legal\r\nrights. In Paris there has been constituted a standing “Committee of\r\nMarriage Reform,” composed of well-known authors, jurists, and women,\r\namong the number being Pierre Louys, Marcel Prevost, Judge Magnaud,\r\nOctave Mirbeau, Maeterlinck, Henri Bataille, Henri Coulon, and Poincaré.\r\n\r\nIn an address to the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate by the President\r\nof this Committee, Henri Coulon, in which he gives the reasons for\r\ndesiring a change in the present marriage laws,[183] he says:\r\n\r\n  “It would be childish to disguise the fact that the institution of\r\n  marriage has entered upon a critical phase; philosophers and novelists\r\n  lay odds on the complete disappearance of the institution. In this,\r\n  perhaps, they go too far. But it is none the less true that it is a\r\n  matter of profound interest and importance to reform the institution\r\n  of marriage. Granted this, how shall we begin?\r\n\r\n  “The entrance into marriage must be made as easy as possible; in this\r\n  way the number of marriages which are based upon love will rapidly\r\n  increase. Then, the married pair must have =equal rights, equal\r\n  duties=, and =equal responsibilities=; in this way marriage will\r\n  become more practical and less immoral than it is at present.\r\n  Finally--and this is the most important of all--it is necessary =to\r\n  facilitate divorce=. Divorce will then become the worthy separation of\r\n  two thinking beings, and will no longer be the disgusting comedy that\r\n  it is at the present day.\r\n\r\n  “For those determined to live apart, for those whose morals are loose,\r\n  indissoluble marriage itself is no longer a bond. Absolute freedom is\r\n  no hindrance to conjugal fidelity and constancy; on the contrary,\r\n  =freedom is the cause of constancy=.\r\n\r\n  “Divorce is not happiness, but it is a help towards happiness. For two\r\n  human beings who hate one another to continue to live together is a\r\n  much greater evil than divorce. Certainly it would be preferable if\r\n  husband and wife could continue to love one another as they did during\r\n  the first days of their married life; that they should love their\r\n  children and be honoured by them. But since humanity is not free from\r\n  faults and vices, this does not always happen. Divorce, as we wish for\r\n  it, makes marriage worthier and more profound. Such marriages will be\r\n  better suited to the new social movements and to the modern spirit.\r\n\r\n  “=The civil equality of the two sexes must be a fundamental principle\r\n  of modern law.= The French Civil Code already recognizes for both\r\n  sexes equal rights in some respects; but the wife still loses a\r\n  certain portion of her rights in the moment that she marries. She is\r\n  in fact rendered incapable of business. The contrast between the\r\n  incapacity for business of the married woman and the capacity for\r\n  business of the unmarried is one of the characteristic traits of our\r\n  legislation.\r\n\r\n  “Divorce, as it now exists, contradicts the indissolubility of the\r\n  marriage bond demanded by the Church. Adultery should only be regarded\r\n  as a ground for divorce, and should not exonerate the murderer who\r\n  kills his adulterous wife or her accomplice.\r\n\r\n  “We demand the abolition of the punishment for adultery, because\r\n  prosecutions of this character arise either from revengeful feelings\r\n  or from litigiousness.”\r\n\r\nJustice demands that with this facilitation of divorce, as advocated in\r\nthe French scheme of marriage reform, there should be associated\r\n=increased= security for the care of the dependent wife and children\r\nafter divorce. In this connexion, =conjugal responsibility= is merely a\r\npart of =sexual responsibility= in general. If two independent, free\r\nindividuals have sexual relations one with the other, in or out of\r\nmarriage, they thereby both undertake in respect of their =own persons=\r\nand of all possible =offspring=, the duty and the responsibility which\r\nare the outcome of a natural instinctive feeling, namely, “the sense of\r\nsexual responsibility.” This must dominate the entire sexual life of\r\nevery human being, as a categorical imperative. In this is to be found\r\nthe necessary ethical counterpoise to the activity of boundless sexual\r\negoism.\r\n\r\nFor the love of the future and its social regulation, the three\r\nfollowing conditions appear to me to be determinative; they form a part\r\nalso of the French programme of marriage reform:\r\n\r\n1. =Equal rights, equal duties, equal responsibilities on the part of\r\nhusband and wife.=\r\n\r\n2. =Facilitation of divorce.=\r\n\r\n3. =Individual freedom to be regarded as preferable to coercion. Freedom\r\nbest promotes constancy in love.=[184]\r\n\r\nIf these principles were strictly carried out in practical life, without\r\ndoubt, and as a matter of absolute certainty, the number of divorces\r\nwould not increase, but would diminish, and we should sooner witness the\r\nrealization of the ideal of true marriage, as the lifelong union of two\r\nfree personalities, fully conscious of their duties and their rights.\r\n\r\nThe high ethical and social significance of family life will ever\r\ncontinue, even under the freest love, by which, as I must again and\r\nagain insist, I do not understand unrestricted and continually changing\r\nextra-conjugal sexual intercourse. Against this the gravest\r\nconsiderations must be urged. What “free love” is, is already apparent\r\nfrom the preceding exposition, but in the next chapter the subject will\r\nbe more thoroughly discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n  ONE HUNDRED TYPICAL MARRIAGES AND SOME CHARACTERISTIC PICTURES OF THE\r\n  MARRIED STATE, AFTER GROSS-HOFFINGER\r\n\r\nIn a long-forgotten, but very interesting, book by Dr. Anton J.\r\nGross-Hoffinger, entitled “The Fate of Women, and Prostitution in\r\nRelation to the Principle of the Indissolubility of Catholic Marriage,\r\nand especially in Relation to the Laws of Austria and the Philosophy of\r\nour Time,”[185] we find a collection, equally interesting to\r\npsychologists and to students of human character, to the physician, the\r\njurist, and the sociologist, of a hundred typical marriages, and also a\r\nmore detailed description of the course of a few marriages. These\r\nsketches deserve to be preserved from oblivion, because they will serve\r\nequally well as an example of marriages of our time.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the author discusses the principal difficulties of\r\nmarriage. He then asks whether, in view of the smallness of the number\r\nof those comparatively happy persons who have found it possible to live\r\na legal and at the same time a natural family life, the existing\r\nmarriage laws, religious ideas, and social customs have attained their\r\naim, whether they give rise, as a general rule, to happy and fruitful,\r\nhonourable and blessed unions. The author hesitated long before\r\npresenting for the first time “to the Catholic world the picture of the\r\nactual state of marriages in that world, a picture based upon numerous\r\nexperiences and observations.” He investigated one hundred marriages of\r\npersons belonging to the most diverse classes, without selection, as\r\nthey came under his observation by chance; then, again, another hundred,\r\nand once again a third hundred. Always the results were equally sad;\r\nalways the ratio between happy and unhappy marriages was the same. The\r\nresult of his investigations was, he states:\r\n\r\n  “Although I have earnestly sought for happy marriages, my search has\r\n  to this extent been vain, that I have never been able to satisfy\r\n  myself that =happy= marriages are anything but =extremely isolated\r\n  exceptions to the general rule=.”\r\n\r\nIn his view this is not the unhappy result of erroneous observation, but\r\ndepends upon exact observation during a long series of years, and in\r\nconditions which brought him into intimate relationship with numbers of\r\npersons in all classes of society.\r\n\r\nThus, after a long, difficult, and careful investigation into a\r\n=hundred= marriages among persons of different classes, he obtained the\r\nfollowing results, here briefly summarized:\r\n\r\n\r\nUpper Classes.\r\n\r\n  1. The marriage not unhappy, wife suffering from disorder arousing\r\n  suspicion of syphilis; conjugal fidelity of the husband prior to the\r\n  occurrence of this illness doubtful.

A happy pair, who had endured all the severe trials of life, had\r\n  forgiven each other everything, and never abandoned one another, a\r\n  =virtuous= marriage in the noblest sense.\r\n\r\nThus, among these hundred marriages there were:\r\n\r\n  Unhappy, about                                       48\r\n  Indifferent                                          36\r\n  Unquestionably happy                                 15\r\n  Virtuous                                              1\r\n  Virtuous and orthodox                                --\r\n\r\nFurther, among these hundred marriages there were:\r\n\r\n  Intentionally immoral                                14\r\n  Dissolute and libertine                              51\r\n  Altogether above suspicion                            ?\r\n\r\nFurther:\r\n\r\n  Wives who were ill owing to the husband’s fault      30\r\n  Wives who were ill not owing to the husband’s fault  30\r\n  Wives who were unhappy, and had themselves to\r\n  blame for it                                         12\r\n\r\nAmong these hundred marriages only one was happy owing to mutual\r\nfaithfulness; all the other slightly happy marriages, if one may call\r\nthem so, were so only because the wife did not disturb herself with\r\nregard to the question of her husband’s faithfulness.\r\n\r\nFrom these statistics Gross-Hoffinger draws the following conclusions:\r\n\r\n1. About =one-half= of all marriages are =absolutely unhappy=.\r\n\r\n2. Much more than one-half of all marriages are obviously\r\n=demoralized=.\r\n\r\n3. The morality of the remaining smaller moiety is preserved only by\r\navoiding questions regarding the husband’s faithfulness.\r\n\r\n4. Fifteen per cent. of all marriages live on the earnings of\r\nprofessional unchastity and procurement.\r\n\r\n5. The number of orthodox marriages which are entirely above every\r\nsuspicion of marital infidelity (assuming the existence of complete\r\nsexual potency) is in the eyes of every reasonable man, who understands\r\nthe demands which Nature makes, and the violence of those demands,\r\n=equivalent to nil=. Hence the =ecclesiastical= purpose of marriage is\r\n=generally=, =fundamentally=, and =completely evaded=.\r\n\r\n  “No =compulsion=,” thus concludes the author, “is more unnatural than\r\n  that of the Catholic (Protestant, Jewish, Greek Orthodox) religion, by\r\n  which is prescribed a compulsory continuance of marriage, with its\r\n  fantastic code and ridiculous conjugal duties and rights.\r\n\r\n  “First of all, this compulsion--this sacrament of marriage--marriage\r\n  which is nothing, can be nothing, =according to nature= should be\r\n  nothing, but =a free union and a civil arrangement=--results in the\r\n  =avoidance of marriage=.\r\n\r\n  “Secondly, it results that in marriage the purposes of marriage are\r\n  not and cannot be completely fulfilled.\r\n\r\n  “Thirdly, that marriage has ceased to be the natural marriage which it\r\n  should be, and has become merely a business, a speculation, or a\r\n  hospital for invalids.”\r\n\r\nIn illustration of this proposition, Gross-Hoffinger finally describes\r\nfrom life twenty-four marriages, some of which, being especially\r\ninteresting, we will here record.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.\r\n\r\n  Countess B., owing to unavoidable difficulties, was unable to contract\r\n  a suitable marriage, and attained the age of thirty whilst still\r\n  unmarried. The result of this was she gave herself to a servant,\r\n  consequently became infected, and died of syphilis some months after\r\n  she had, finally, married. Her husband was left with an unhappy\r\n  memorial of this brief marriage.\r\n\r\n  2.\r\n\r\n  Count C., a man of high rank, lost his beloved wife through death.\r\n  Circumstances made it impossible for him to marry again. He was afraid\r\n  of acquiring venereal disorders, and therefore abstained from natural\r\n  connexion. Through lack of natural sexual gratification his sexual\r\n  impulse became perverse, and he took to the practice of Greek love.\r\n\r\n  3.\r\n\r\n  Prince D., young, impotent, concluded a marriage of convenience with a\r\n  beautiful, very passionate lady, who, on account of her husband’s\r\n  impotence, compensated herself with domestic servants, members of her\r\n  retinue, and cavalry soldiers, and gave birth in these conditions to\r\n  several children, which inherited the title of the putative father. In\r\n  such circumstances the marriage has been very unhappy, but necessity\r\n  compels the husband to bear his fate with patience.\r\n\r\n  4.\r\n\r\n  Count E., in other respects a man of fine character, made a marriage\r\n  of convenience with a lady of good family, who, however, was not in a\r\n  position to make him happy. From natural nobility of character, he was\r\n  unwilling to distress his unhappy wife by entering openly into\r\n  relations with a concubine, and therefore sought sexual gratification\r\n  with prostitutes. He became infected, and transmitted the illness to\r\n  his wife, who became seriously ill, and gave birth to diseased\r\n  children. Although the poor sufferer is unaware of the origin of her\r\n  troubles, and bears them with patience; although her husband takes all\r\n  possible care of her, and does his best to bring about the restoration\r\n  of her health; the marriage, owing to the uneasy conscience of the\r\n  husband and the physical suffering of the wife, is obviously a very\r\n  unhappy one.\r\n\r\n  5.\r\n\r\n  Baron F., a man of wide influence, in youth a libertine--frivolous,\r\n  and of an emotional disposition, insusceptible to finer feelings,\r\n  contracted successively four marriages of convenience, which in all\r\n  cases terminated in the death of the wife. There is reason to believe\r\n  that the unceasing libertinism and unscrupulous conduct of the husband\r\n  had shortened the life of his wives--and this is all the more probable\r\n  because all the Baron’s children are sickly and scrofulous.\r\n\r\n  6.\r\n\r\n  Count G., dissipated libertine, wasted his property in wild\r\n  extravagance, and compelled his wife to live apart from him, whilst he\r\n  spent enormous sums on professional singers and dancers and common\r\n  prostitutes. Being ruined as completely financially as physically, he\r\n  was despised by persons of all classes, persecuted by his creditors,\r\n  and absolutely detested by his wife. Although his pleasures consist\r\n  chiefly in reminiscences, he still devotes enormous sums to them, the\r\n  money being obtained by a continued increase in his debts.\r\n\r\n  7.\r\n\r\n  Count H. has been married for many years, but lives on the most\r\n  unpleasant terms with his wife, and devotes his spare time to the\r\n  society of prostitutes. The scum of the street form his favourite\r\n  associates; but his voluptuous adventures carry him also into family\r\n  life, and no respectable middle-class wife or girl, however innocent,\r\n  is safe from his advances, which are all the more incredible because\r\n  he is quite an old man and completely impotent. He uses all possible\r\n  means to make the woman of his choice compliant--presents, promises,\r\n  threats.\r\n\r\n  8.\r\n\r\n  Dr. S., husband of an immoral wife, public official, libertine,\r\n  philosopher, enjoying a small secured income. Lives with his wife on a\r\n  footing which permits both parties unlimited freedom. The worthy\r\n  couple devote their whole energies to earning money by their industry,\r\n  in part by secret prostitution on the part of the wife, in part by\r\n  direct and indirect procurement by the holding of piquant evening\r\n  parties for youthful members of the aristocracy. The family has an\r\n  extraordinary vogue. Persons of high position are engaged in\r\n  confidential intercourse with them; young girls of the better classes\r\n  gladly attend their soirées, since there they meet the élite of the\r\n  young aristocracy, rich Jews, and officers. This interesting pair get\r\n  through an almost incredible amount of money; they keep a magnificent\r\n  carriage, they have a country house, a valuable collection of\r\n  pictures, etc. It is only from their servants that both of them\r\n  receive little respect, since the male portion of the household\r\n  subserve the lustful desires of the wife, the female domestics those\r\n  of the husband, and all must be initiated into the secrets of the\r\n  household industry.\r\n\r\n  9.\r\n\r\n  Dr. U. was till recently an old bachelor, who had never wished to\r\n  share his property with a wife and children, and found it much cheaper\r\n  and more agreeable to impregnate servant-girls and other neglected\r\n  characters than to keep a mistress, or to seek his pleasures in the\r\n  street. Finally, becoming infirm at sixty-two years of age, and\r\n  needing nursing, on account of an occasional gouty swelling of the\r\n  leg, he discovered that it was not good for man to be alone. Having\r\n  rank and wealth, it would have been easy for him to find a young and\r\n  pretty girl who, under the title of wife, would have undertaken to\r\n  play the part of sick nurse. But the old practitioner knew too well\r\n  the value of what he had to offer to throw himself away on a poor\r\n  girl. He considered that it would be reasonable to choose such a\r\n  partner that he would not be obliged to divide his income, and to find\r\n  some one to take care of him in his old age who would cost him nothing\r\n  at all, but would rather provide for her own needs. He thought less,\r\n  therefore, of youth than of property, less of beauty than of thrifty\r\n  habits; and finally found an old maid, a woman with some property,\r\n  who, on account of a somewhat unattractive exterior, had failed to\r\n  obtain a husband. Now one can see the prudent husband, who is as\r\n  faithful to his wife as the gout is faithful to him, walking from time\r\n  to time in the street on the arm of his life companion, whose aspect\r\n  is somewhat discontented. She still wears the same clothes which she\r\n  wore before her marriage, and which have a sufficiently shabby\r\n  appearance, but she endures her lot with patience, because she is now\r\n  greeted as “gnädige Frau,” and people kiss her hand, as they did not\r\n  do formerly.\r\n\r\n  10.\r\n\r\n  Count J., a man of unblemished character, lived for some time a happy\r\n  married life. The increasing age of the wife, however, associated with\r\n  the exceptional constitution of the Count, whose youth seemed\r\n  remarkably enduring, led to scenes of jealousy, which embittered the\r\n  life of both. We can hardly suppose that this jealousy is altogether\r\n  unfounded; but surely it is a matter for regret that two human beings\r\n  of distinctly noble character should by marriage be exposed to\r\n  lifelong unhappiness.\r\n\r\n  11.\r\n\r\n  Herr von K., a young merchant in the wholesale trade, is married to\r\n  the daughter of a man of position, and the wife by a rich dowry helped\r\n  to found her husband’s fortunes; hence she enjoys the distinction over\r\n  other wives that her husband pretends a great tenderness for her, and\r\n  conceals his indiscretions with the greatest possible care. For this\r\n  reason, she has always been devoted to him; she regards him as the\r\n  example for all other husbands, as a true phenomenon in the midst of\r\n  an utterly depraved world of immoral men. And as an actual fact, if\r\n  one sees this man, how he lives in appearance only for his business,\r\n  with what delicate modesty he avoids any conversation about loose\r\n  women, if one hears him zealously preach against husbands who deceive\r\n  their wives, how inconceivable it is to him that a man should find any\r\n  pleasure in immoral women--one would be willing to swear that he is\r\n  everything that his wife enthusiastically describes him to be. But\r\n  some wags amongst his acquaintances, by taking incredible pains,\r\n  discovered that this honourable merchant had no less than =seven\r\n  mistresses=, two of whom belonged to the class of prostitutes, two to\r\n  the class of grisettes; the remaining three had been decent\r\n  middle-class women. To these last he presented himself under various\r\n  names and in the most diverse forms--now as attaché to an embassy, now\r\n  as an officer, now as a journeyman mechanic. To all these latter\r\n  mistresses he had promised marriage, and by a succession of presents,\r\n  oaths, and lies, he had in each case attained his end, and thereafter\r\n  abandoned them without remorse to the consequences of the adventure,\r\n  whilst he himself set out to seek in a fresh quarter of the town new\r\n  sacrifices for the altar of his lusts. Since he never had anything to\r\n  do with known prostitutes and procuresses, but by personal pains\r\n  provided the materials for his pleasures, he succeeded both as a\r\n  merchant and as a husband in preserving the reputation of a man free\r\n  from illicit passion and deserving of all confidence.\r\n\r\n  12.\r\n\r\n  Major W., a distinguished officer, a man of honour in every respect,\r\n  had in youth married a chambermaid, naturally, as one can imagine,\r\n  from pure inclination. But the marriage remained barren, because the\r\n  wife suffered from organic troubles; and soon her sexual powers were\r\n  completely extinguished. Whilst the husband still remained virile, the\r\n  wife was already an old woman, suffering from spasmodic and other\r\n  affections, surrounded always by medicine-bottles and medical\r\n  appliances, always ill-humoured and nagging, a true torment for the\r\n  good-natured and amiable husband. The latter bears with Christian\r\n  patience and inexhaustible love the ill-humour of his wife; but Nature\r\n  is less pliable than his kind heart: his conjugal tenderness\r\n  diminishes, and his ardent temperament seeks other outlets for the\r\n  gratification of his natural sexual desires. The sick wife notices\r\n  this coolness, and revenges herself by a refined cruelty. She knows\r\n  that sulkiness on her part makes him ill and miserable; she therefore\r\n  afflicts him with coldness of manner, and by jealousy and ill-temper\r\n  she makes his life a hell. There occur horrible scenes of domestic\r\n  brawling, which more than once have led the husband to attempt to end\r\n  his troubles by suicide. He suffers in a threefold fashion: by the\r\n  continued irritation of his healthy natural impulse, by the illnesses\r\n  he contracts in gratifying that impulse, and by the sorrows of his\r\n  really loved wife. He imposes upon himself a voluntary celibacy in\r\n  order that he may not make her ill; but this sacrifice does not\r\n  suffice, it does not make his wife gentler towards him. She demands\r\n  from him, tacitly, all the ardency of the bridegroom; there is no\r\n  rescue possible from this inferno. The husband surrenders himself to a\r\n  quiet despair. He is faithful in his vocation; he lives only for the\r\n  wife, who torments him continually. The neighbours see a very\r\n  unedifying example of an extremely unhappy marriage, originally\r\n  contracted as a pure love match, and none the less entailing martyrdom\r\n  alike on husband and wife.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--That in Vienna the conjugal conditions so graphically described\r\nin the above extracts are still much the same as formerly, and that\r\nmarriage needs and marriage lies are there exceptionally painful is\r\nshown by the foundation in Vienna of a “Society for Marriage Reform,”\r\nwhich sent to the Assembly of German Jurists, meeting at Kiel in the\r\nbeginning of September, 1906, the telegraphic request that they would\r\nundertake a revision of Austrian marriage law, since hitherto no cure\r\nhad been found for unhappy marriage in Austria, no divorce was possible,\r\nand those who had obtained a judicial separation could, according to\r\nCanon Law, sue one another on account of adultery (_cf._ _Neue Freie\r\nPresse_, No. 15108, September 13, 1906). It is hardly credible, but,\r\naccording to a report in the _Berlin Aerzte-Correspondenz_, 1907, No. 8,\r\nit is true, that the Medical Court of Honour for the town of Berlin and\r\nthe province of Brandenburg, in the year of our Lord 1906, punished\r\nphysicians on the ground of adultery!\r\n\r\n  [155] P. Näcke, one of the most trustworthy authorities on sexual\r\n  anthropology, writes as follows: “That in ancient times, before\r\n  monogamy, there was polygamy, or even a state resembling promiscuity,\r\n  =is very probable= (Westermarck notwithstanding), =and can, in fact,\r\n  be assumed a priori=” (“Einiges zur Frauenfrage und zur sexuellen\r\n  Abstinenz”--“A Contribution to the Woman’s Question and to the Problem\r\n  of Sexual Abstinence”), published in the _Archiv f.\r\n  Kriminalanthropologie_, vol. xiv., p. 52 (Hans Gross, 1903). _Cf._\r\n  also Lohsing’s “Zustimmung zur Annahme einer ursprünglichen\r\n  Promiscuität,” _ibid._, vol. xvi., p. 332.\r\n\r\n  The question of sexual promiscuity has recently been further\r\n  considered by P. Näcke (“Earliest Beginnings of Human Society,” in\r\n  _Die Umschau_ of August 17, 1907). He believes that the state of pure\r\n  promiscuity lasted a short time only, and gave place to certain nuclei\r\n  of family structure, a kind of semi-promiscuity, which, prior to the\r\n  complete development of the family union, lasted much longer than the\r\n  state of pure promiscuity. Still, these earliest families were merely\r\n  temporary, and only later became fixed and permanent. This assumption,\r\n  however, does not affect the fact of a primordial pure promiscuity.\r\n  Näcke himself also recognizes promiscuity as the natural state of\r\n  primitive man.\r\n\r\n  [156] H.

Upon its\r\nproper solution depends the future of civilization, and our ultimate\r\nliberation from the ignominious conditions of the amatory life of the\r\npresent day, dependent as these are upon coercive marriage. This is our\r\nfirm conviction, our profound belief, one which we share with many, and\r\nthose not the worst minds of our day.\r\n\r\nFree love is neither, as malevolent opponents maintain, the abolition of\r\nmarriage, nor is it the organization of extra-conjugal sexual\r\nintercourse. Free love and extra-conjugal sexual intercourse have\r\nnothing whatever to do one with the other. Indeed, I go so far as to\r\nmaintain that true free love, as it must and will prevail, will limit\r\ncasual and unregulated extra-conjugal sexual intercourse =to a far\r\ngreater extent= than coercive marriage has ever succeeded in doing.\r\nAbove all, free love will ennoble sexual intercourse.\r\n\r\nFor the longer, in existing economic conditions, we cling to the\r\nantiquated “coercive marriage,” which has so long been in need of\r\nreform, the smaller is the number of those who desire to marry, the more\r\nadvanced becomes the age of marriage, the greater becomes the general\r\nsexual wretchedness, the deeper shall we sink into the mephitic slough\r\nof prostitution, towards which the increasing promiscuity of\r\nextra-conjugal sexual intercourse inevitably leads us.\r\n\r\nFor this is the peculiar, hypocritical, and absurd mode of argument of\r\nthose who uphold conventional marriage; they despise and brand with\r\ninfamy every sexual relationship of two adult independent persons based\r\nupon free love, and sanction quite openly casual transitory\r\nextra-conjugal sexual intercourse, devoid of all personal relationships,\r\nnot only with prostitutes, but also with respectable women.\r\n\r\n  “Bachelorhood,” says Max Nordau, “is very far from being equivalent to\r\n  sexual continence. The bachelor receives from society the tacit\r\n  permission to indulge in the convenience of intercourse with woman,\r\n  when and where he can; it calls his self-seeking pleasures\r\n  ‘successes,’ and surrounds them with a kind of poetic glory; and the\r\n  amiable vice of Don Juan arouses in society a feeling composed of\r\n  envy, sympathy, and secret admiration.”[186]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, =this same= conventional coercive marriage morality\r\ndemands from the girl complete sexual continence and intactness until\r\nthe time of her marriage!\r\n\r\nBut every reasonable and just man must ask the question, Where, then,\r\nare the unmarried men to gratify their sexual impulse if at the same\r\ntime the unmarried girls are condemned to absolute chastity?\r\n\r\nIt is merely necessary to place these two facts =side by side= in order\r\nto expose the utter mendacity and shamelessness of the coercive marriage\r\nmorality, and to display the true cancer of our sexual life, the sole\r\ncause of the increasing diffusion of =prostitution=, of =wild sexual\r\npromiscuity=, and of =venereal diseases=.\r\n\r\nWhen hereafter, before the judgment-seat of history, the dreadful\r\n“_j’accuse_” is uttered against the sexual corruption of our time, then\r\nthere will be a good defence for those of us who, under the device,\r\n“Away with prostitution! away with the brothels! away with all ‘wild’\r\nlove! away with venereal diseases!” were the first to indicate =free\r\nlove= as the one and only means of rescue from these miseries.\r\n\r\nWe are always told that men are not yet ready for the free, independent\r\nmanagement of their sexual life; mankind is not yet ripe for the\r\nnecessary responsibility. Our opponents point especially to the danger\r\nof such an opinion and such reforms for the lower classes.\r\n\r\nBut human beings are better than the defenders of the obsolete\r\nconventional morality would have us believe, and above all, it is the\r\nmembers of the lower classes whom we may quietly allow to follow the\r\ndictates of their own hearts. They, indeed, give us the example that\r\nfreedom is not equivalent to immorality and pleasure-seeking; that, on\r\nthe contrary, it is freedom that awakens and keeps active the\r\nconsciousness of duty and the sense of responsibility.\r\n\r\nAlfred Blaschko rightly draws attention to the fact that among the\r\nproletariat for a long time already the idea of free love has been\r\nactually realized. In a large majority of cases men and women of these\r\nclasses have sexual intercourse with one another, especially between the\r\nages of eighteen and twenty-five, without marrying.[187]\r\n\r\n  “Among the proletariat free love has never been regarded as sinful.\r\n  Where there is no property which is capable of being left to a\r\n  legitimate heir, where the appeal of the heart draws man and woman\r\n  together, from the very earliest times people have troubled themselves\r\n  little about the blessing of the priest; and had it not been that at\r\n  the present day the civil form of marriage is so simple, whilst, on\r\n  the other hand, there are so many difficulties placed in the path of\r\n  unmarried mothers and illegitimate children, =who can tell if the\r\n  modern proletariat would not long ago, as far as they themselves are\r\n  concerned, have abolished marriage=?”[188]\r\n\r\nBlaschko adduces proofs that in all places in which free love is not\r\npossible =prostitution takes its place=.\r\n\r\nThis fact affords a striking proof of the necessity of free love. For\r\nthere can be no doubt as to the correct answer to the question which is\r\nbetter, prostitution or free love.\r\n\r\nMax Marcus and other physicians have recently discussed the question\r\nwhether the medical man is justified in recommending extra-conjugal\r\nsexual intercourse. I myself, as a physician, and as an ardent supporter\r\nof the efforts for the suppression of venereal diseases, in view of the\r\nenormous increase of professional prostitution (both public and\r\nprivate), and in view also of the extraordinarily wide diffusion of\r\nvenereal diseases, feel compelled to answer this question, generally\r\nspeaking, =in the negative=. Yet I look to the introduction of free\r\nlove, and in association with free love of a new sexual morality, in\r\naccordance with which man and woman are regarded as two free\r\npersonalities, with equal rights and also equal responsibilities, as the\r\nonly possible rescue from the misery of prostitution and of venereal\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nPlace the free woman beside the free man, inspire both with the profound\r\nsense of =responsibility= which will result from the activity of the\r\nlove of two free personalities, and you will see that to them and to\r\ntheir children such love will bring true happiness.\r\n\r\nBefore going further into this problem of free love, I will give a brief\r\naccount of the history of the question during the nineteenth century. We\r\nshall see that quite a number of leading spirits, morally lofty natures,\r\nwere occupied with the question, because they were deeply impressed with\r\nthe intolerable character of existing conditions in the sexual sphere,\r\nand were convinced that help was only to be found in a relaxation of\r\nthose conditions in the sense of a =freer= conception of sexual\r\nrelationships.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the romanticists (_vide supra_, pp. 169 and 175) in the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth century in England, William Godwin, the\r\nlover and husband of Mary Wollstonecraft (the celebrated advocate of\r\nwoman’s rights), in his “Political Justice,” declared the conventional\r\ncoercive marriage to be an obsolete institution, by which the freedom of\r\nthe individual was seriously curtailed. Marriage is a question of\r\nproperty, and one person ought not to become the property of another.\r\nGodwin maintained that the abolition of marriage would have no evil\r\nconsequences. The free love and subsequent marriage of Godwin and Mary\r\nWollstonecraft deserves a short description. Godwin was of opinion that\r\nthe members of a family should not see too much of one another. He also\r\nbelieved that they would interfere with one another’s work if they lived\r\nin the same house. For this reason he furnished some rooms for himself\r\nat a little distance from Mary Wollstonecraft’s dwelling, and often\r\nfirst appeared at her house at a late lunch; the intervening hours were\r\nspent by both in literary work. They exchanged letters also during the\r\nday.[189]\r\n\r\nDoubtless under the influence of the views of Godwin, Shelley, in the\r\nnotes to “Queen Mab,” writes a violent polemic against coercive\r\nmarriage. He says:\r\n\r\n  “Love withers under constraint; its very essence is liberty; it is\r\n  compatible neither with obedience, jealousy, nor fear; it is there\r\n  most pure, perfect, and unlimited, where its votaries live in\r\n  confidence, equality, and unreserve. How long, then, ought the sexual\r\n  connexion to last? What law ought to specify the extent of the\r\n  grievances which should limit its duration? A husband and wife ought\r\n  to continue so long united as they love each other; any law which\r\n  should bind them to cohabitation for one moment after the decay of\r\n  their affection would be a most intolerable tyranny.”[190]\r\n\r\nHe then proceeds to attack the conventional morality so intimately\r\nassociated with coercive marriage, and concludes with the words:\r\n\r\n  “Chastity is a monkish and evangelical superstition, a greater foe to\r\n  natural temperance even than unintellectual sensuality; it strikes at\r\n  the root of all domestic happiness, and consigns more than half of the\r\n  human race to misery, that some few may monopolize according to law. A\r\n  system could not well have been devised more studiously hostile to\r\n  human happiness than marriage. I conceive that from the abolition of\r\n  marriage, the fit and natural arrangement of sexual connexion would\r\n  result. =I by no means assert that the intercourse would be\r\n  promiscuous=; on the contrary, it appears, from the relation of parent\r\n  to child, that this union is generally of long duration, and marked\r\n  above all others with generosity and self-devotion.”[191]\r\n\r\nHere, also, we find the expression of the firm conviction that in the\r\nfreedom of love is to be found an assured guarantee for its durability!\r\n\r\nLater, also, the English Pre-Raphaelites, especially John Ruskin,\r\nadvocated free love, and maintained that the sacredness of these natural\r\nbonds lay in their very essence. It is love which first makes marriage\r\nlegal, not marriage which legalizes love (_cf._ Charlotte Broicher,\r\n“John Ruskin and his Work,” vol. i., pp. 104-106; Leipzig, 1902).\r\n\r\nIn Germany, at the commencement of the nineteenth century, a lively\r\ndiscussion of the problems of love and marriage ensued upon the\r\npublication of Friedrich Schlegel’s “Lucinde” and Goethe’s\r\n“Wahlverwandtschaften”--“Elective Affinities” (1809).\r\n\r\nGoethe, in his very rich amatory life, especially in his relationship to\r\nCharlotte von Stein and to Christiane Vulpius, with the latter of whom\r\nhe lived for eighteen years in a free “marriage of conscience,”[192] and\r\nwhose son, August, the offspring of this union, he adopted long before\r\nthe marriage was legitimized, realized the ideal of free love more than\r\nonce. Although in his book “Wahlverwandtschaften” (“Elective\r\nAffinities”) he at length gave the victory to the moral conception of\r\nmonogamic marriage, and propounded it as an illuminating ideal for\r\ncivilization (which “ideal standpoint” we ourselves, as we have shown in\r\nthe previous chapters, fully share), yet in this novel he has\r\nrepresented conjugal struggles, from which it appears how profoundly he\r\nwas impressed by the importance of a transformation of amatory life in\r\nthe direction of freedom. It is especially by the mouth of the Count in\r\nthis work that he gives utterance to such ideas. The latter records the\r\nadvice of one of his friends that every marriage should be contracted\r\nfor the term of five years only.\r\n\r\n  “This number,” he said, “is a beautiful, sacred, odd number, and such\r\n  a period of time would be sufficient for the married pair to learn to\r\n  know one another, for them to bring a few children into the world, to\r\n  separate, and, what would be most beautiful of all, to come together\r\n  again.”\r\n\r\nOften he would exclaim:\r\n\r\n  “How happily would the first portion of the time pass! Two or three\r\n  years at least would pass very happily. Then very likely one member of\r\n  the pair would wish that the union should be prolonged; and this\r\n  desire would increase the more nearly the terminus of the marriage\r\n  approached. An indifferent, even an unsatisfied, member of such a\r\n  union would be pleased by such a demeanour on the part of the other.\r\n  One is apt to forget how in good society the passing of time is\r\n  unnoticed; one finds with agreeable surprise, when the allotted time\r\n  has passed away, =that it has been tacitly prolonged=. It is precisely\r\n  this voluntary, tacit prolongation of sexual relationship, freely\r\n  undertaken by both parties without any extraneous compulsion, to which\r\n  Goethe ascribes =a profound moral significance=.”\r\n\r\nI should like to draw the attention of students of Goethe to the fact\r\nthat this recommendation of a temporary marriage for the term of five\r\nyears, with tacit prolongation of the term, is a very ancient Japanese\r\ncustom, or, at any rate, was so thirty years ago.\r\n\r\nWernich, who for several years was Professor of Medicine at the Imperial\r\nUniversity of Japan, remarks:\r\n\r\n  “Marriages were concluded for a term only: in the case of persons of\r\n  standing for =five= years; among the lower classes for a shorter term.\r\n  It was =very rare=, however, only in cases in which the marriage was\r\n  manifestly unhappy, for a separation to take place when the term\r\n  expired. If there were healthy living children such a separation\r\n  hardly ever occurred--most of these temporary marriages were, in fact,\r\n  extremely happy, and the same is true of Jewish marriages, in which\r\n  divorce is easily effected by a very simple ceremonial, closely\r\n  resembling that of the Japanese.”[193]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn view of the remarkable coincidence between the proposal in Goethe’s\r\n“Elective Affinities” and the Japanese custom, we are probably justified\r\nin assuming that Goethe was acquainted with the latter.\r\n\r\n“Lucinde” gave expression to the feelings and moods of the time in\r\nrespect of love and marriage on behalf of a circle far wider than that\r\nof the romanticists. At no time were the ideals of free love so deeply\r\nfelt, so enthusiastically presented, as then; above all, by the\r\nbeautiful Karoline, who, after long “marriage wanderings,” especially\r\nwith A. W. Schegel, finally found the happiness of her life in a free\r\nmarriage with Schelling, which subsequently became a legally recognized\r\nunion.\r\n\r\n  “In her letters,” says Kuno Fischer, “she praises again and again the\r\n  man of her choice and of her heart, in whose love she had really\r\n  attained the goal which she had longed and sought in labyrinthine\r\n  wanderings.... And that Schelling was the man who was able completely\r\n  to master the heart of this woman and to make her his own, gives to\r\n  his features also an expression which beautifies them.”[194]\r\n\r\nRahel, Dorothea Schlegel, and Henriette Herz, extolled, under the\r\ninfluence of “Lucinde,” the happiness of free love. For this period of\r\ngenius in Jena and Berlin, as Rudolph von Gottschall calls it, the\r\nfree-love relationship of Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia and Frau\r\nPauline Wiesel was typical. This relationship is more intimately known\r\nto us from the letters exchanged between the two, published by Alexander\r\nBüchner in 1865. In these letters, to quote a saying of Ludmilla Assing,\r\nwe find “the most passionate expression of all that it is possible to\r\nexpress in writing.”\r\n\r\nIn France the discussion of the question of free love was to an\r\nimportant extent associated with the communistic-socialistic ideas of\r\nSaint Simon, Enfantin, and Fourier. Before this, Rétif de la Bretonne,\r\nin his “Découverte Australe” (a work which exercised a great influence\r\nupon Charles Fourier),[195] demanded that the duration of marriage\r\nshould be in the first instance two years, with which period the\r\ncontract should spontaneously terminate. Saint Simon and Barrault\r\nproclaimed the “free wife,” Père Enfantin proclaimed the “free union,”\r\nand Fourier proclaimed “free love” in the phalanstery.\r\n\r\nA reflection of this idea is to be found in the novels of George Sand,\r\nespecially “Lelia” and “Jacques,” these tragedies of marriage; in\r\n“Jacques,” for example, we find the following passage:\r\n\r\n  “I continue to believe that marriage is one of the most hateful of\r\n  institutions. I have no doubt whatever that when the human race has\r\n  advanced further towards rationality and the love of justice, marriage\r\n  will be abolished. =A human and not less sacred union= would then\r\n  replace it, and the existence of the children would be not less cared\r\n  for and secured, without therefore binding in eternal fetters the\r\n  freedom of the parents.”\r\n\r\nWe must mention Hortense Allart de Méritens (1801-1879) as a\r\ncontemporary of the much-loving George Sand, and, like her, a\r\ntheoretical and practical advocate of free love. She was cousin to the\r\nwell-known authoress Delphine Gay, and herself wrote a _roman à clef_,\r\npublished in 1872, “Les Enchantements de Prudence,” in which she records\r\nthe history of her own life, devoted to free love. First the beloved of\r\na nobleman, she ran away when she discovered she was pregnant, and then\r\nlived successively with the Italian statesman Gino Capponi (1826-1829);\r\nwith the celebrated French author Chateaubriand (1829-1831); with the\r\nEnglish novelist and poet Bulwer (1831-1836); the Italian Mazzini\r\n(1837-1840); the critic Sainte-Beuve (1840-1841); these being all free\r\nunions. From 1843 to 1846 she was the perfectly legitimate and extremely\r\nunhappy wife of an architect named Napoléon de Méritens, whereas with\r\nher earlier lovers she had lived most happily. Léon Séché, in the _Revue\r\nde Paris_ of July 1, 1907, has recently described the life of this\r\nnotable priestess of free love, to whose above-mentioned romance George\r\nSand wrote a preface (_cf._ _Literarisches Echo_ of August 1, 1907, pp.\r\n1612, 1613).\r\n\r\nIn Sweden at about the same time the celebrated poet C. J. L. Almquist\r\nwas a powerful advocate for free love. In the numbers for July and\r\nAugust, 1900, of the monthly review, _Die Insel_, Ellen Key has\r\npublished a thoughtful essay, containing an analysis of Almquist’s views\r\non this subject.\r\n\r\nIn the novel “Es Geht An” Almquist advocates the thesis that true love\r\nneeds no consecration by a marriage ceremony. On the contrary, a\r\nceremony of this kind belies the very nature of marriage, for it forms\r\nand cements false unions; and any relationship concluded on the lowest\r\ngrounds, if it has only been preceded by a marriage ceremony, is\r\nregarded as pure, whilst a union based upon true love without marriage\r\nis regarded as unchaste. In the sense of free love Lara Widbeck, in “Es\r\nGeht An,” arranges her own life and that of her husband Albert. Both are\r\nto be masters of their respective persons and of their respective\r\nproperty; they are to live for themselves, the work of each is to be\r\npursued independently of the other, and in this way it will be possible\r\nto preserve a lifelong love, instead of seeing love transformed into\r\nlifelong indifference or hate.\r\n\r\nEven at the present day in Sweden the idea of free love is known, after\r\nthis romance of Almquist’s, as the “Es-geht-an idea” and also as\r\n“briar-rose morality.” It was, above all, Ellen Key who revived\r\nAlmquist’s idea, and enlarged it to the extensive programme of marriage\r\nreform in the direction of free love, which we shall consider more fully\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nIn his last writings Schopenhauer occupied himself at considerable\r\nlength with the problems of love, but entirely from the standpoint of\r\nmisogyny and of duplex sexual morality. Still, he recognized the great\r\ndangers and disasters which the traditional coercive marriage entails\r\nupon society, and rightly regarded this formal marriage as the principal\r\nsource of sexual corruption.\r\n\r\nIn his essay “Concerning Women” (“Parerga and Paralipomena,” vol. xi.,\r\npp. 657-659), ed. Grisebach, he writes:\r\n\r\n  “Whereas among the polygamist nations every woman is cared for, among\r\n  monogamic peoples the number of married women is limited, and there\r\n  remains an enormous number of unsupported superfluous women.[196]\r\n  Among the upper classes these vegetate as useless old maids; among the\r\n  lower classes they are forced to earn their living by immeasurably\r\n  severe toil, or else they become prostitutes. These latter lead a life\r\n  equally devoid of pleasure and of honour; but in the circumstances\r\n  they are indispensable for the gratification of the male sex, and\r\n  hence they constitute a publicly recognized profession, the especial\r\n  purpose of which is to safeguard against seduction those women more\r\n  highly favoured by fortune, who have found husbands, or may reasonably\r\n  hope to do so. In London alone there are 80,000 such women. =What else\r\n  are these women than human sacrifices on the altar of\r\n  monogamy=--=sacrifices rendered inevitable by the very nature of the\r\n  monogamic institution?= All the women to whom we now allude--women in\r\n  this miserable position--form the inevitable counterpoise to the\r\n  ladies of Europe, with their pretension and their pride. For the\r\n  female sex, regarded as a whole, polygamy is a real benefit. On the\r\n  other hand, from the rationalistic point of view, it is impossible to\r\n  see why a man whose wife is suffering from a chronic disease, or\r\n  remains unfruitful, or has gradually become too old for him, should\r\n  not take a second wife. That which produces so many converts to\r\n  Mormonism appears to be the rejection by the Mormons of the unnatural\r\n  institution of monogamy. In addition, moreover, the allotment to the\r\n  wife of unnatural rights has imposed upon her unnatural duties, whose\r\n  neglect, nevertheless, makes her unhappy. To many a man considerations\r\n  of position, of property, make marriage inadvisable, unless the\r\n  conditions are exceptionally favourable. He would then wish to obtain\r\n  a wife of his own choice, under conditions which would leave him free\r\n  from obligations to her and her children. However economical,\r\n  reasonable, and suitable these conditions may be, if she agrees to\r\n  them, and does not insist upon the immoderate rights which marriage\r\n  alone secures to her, she will, because marriage is the basis of every\r\n  society, find herself compelled to lead an unhappy life, one which, to\r\n  a certain degree, is dishonourable; because human nature involves\r\n  this, that we assign a quite immeasurable value to the opinion of\r\n  others. If, on the other hand, she does not comply, she runs the\r\n  danger either of being compelled to belong as a wife to a man\r\n  repulsive to her, or else of withering as an old maid, for the period\r\n  in which she can realize her value is very short. In relation to this\r\n  aspect of our monogamic arrangement, the profoundly learned treatise\r\n  of Thomasius, _De Concubinatu_, is of the greatest possible value, for\r\n  we learn from it =that among all cultured people, and in all times,\r\n  until the date of the Lutheran Reformation, concubinage was permitted,\r\n  and even to a certain extent legally recognized, and was an\r\n  institution not involving any dishonour=. From this position it was\r\n  degraded only by the Lutheran Reformation, for the degradation of\r\n  concubinage was regarded as a means by which the marriage of priests\r\n  could be justified; and, on the other hand, after the Lutheran\r\n  denunciation of concubinage, the semi-official recognition of that\r\n  institution by the Roman Catholic Church was no longer possible.\r\n\r\n  “Regarding polygamy there need be =no dispute=, for it is a\r\n  universally existing fact, and the only question is regarding its\r\n  =regulation=. Where are the true monogamists? We all live =at least=\r\n  for a time, but most of us continually, in a state of polygamy. Since,\r\n  consequently, every man makes use of many wives, nothing could be more\r\n  just than to leave him free, and even to compel him, to provide for\r\n  many wives.”\r\n\r\nJust as are these views of Schopenhauer’s regarding the necessity of a\r\nfreer conception and a freer configuration of sexual relations, and\r\nregarding the shamefulness of exposing to infamy the unmarried mother\r\nand the illegitimate child, so much the more dangerous is his view of\r\nthe part to be played by women in this reform of marriage. Woman as an\r\ninferior being, without freedom, is once more to lose all her rights,\r\ninstead of standing beside man as a free personality with equal rights\r\nand equal duties. The result of a rearrangement of amatory life on this\r\nbasis would inevitably be a new and a worse sexual slavery.\r\n\r\nAs Julius Frauenstädt records, Schopenhauer, in a separate manuscript\r\nfound amongst his papers, has described the evil conditions of monogamy,\r\nand has recommended, as a step to reform, the practice of “tetragamy.”\r\nThis peculiar and unquestionably very interesting essay has not found\r\nits way into the Royal Library of Berlin. With regard to the whereabouts\r\nof the manuscript we are uncertain; perhaps Frauenstädt destroyed it.\r\n\r\nHowever, we find a brief, hitherto unpublished, extract from this essay\r\nin Schopenhauer’s manuscript book, “Die Brieftasche,” written in 1823,\r\nwhich is preserved in the Royal Library in Berlin.[197]\r\n\r\nI publish here, for the first time, the summary account of tetragamy\r\ncontained on pp. 70-77 of the aforesaid manuscript book:\r\n\r\n\r\nSKETCH OF SCHOPENHAUER’S “TETRAGAMY”\r\n\r\n(HITHERTO UNPUBLISHED).\r\n\r\n  “Inasmuch as Nature makes the number of women nearly identical with\r\n  that of men, whilst women retain only about half as long as men their\r\n  capacity for procreation and their suitability for masculine\r\n  gratification, the human sexual relationship is disordered at the very\r\n  outset. By the equal numbers of the respective sexes, Nature appears\r\n  to point to monogamy; on the other hand, a man has =one= wife for the\r\n  satisfaction of his procreative capacity only for half the time for\r\n  which that capacity endures; he must, then, take a second wife when\r\n  the first begins to wither; but for each man only one woman is\r\n  available. The tendency exhibited by woman in respect of the duration\r\n  of her sexual capacity is compensated, on the other hand, by the\r\n  quantity of that capacity: she is capable of gratifying two or three\r\n  vigorous men simultaneously, without suffering in any way. In\r\n  monogamy, woman employs only half of her sexual capacity, and\r\n  satisfies only half of her desires.\r\n\r\n  “If, now, this relationship were arranged in accordance with purely\r\n  physical considerations (and we are concerned here with a physical,\r\n  extremely urgent need, the satisfaction of which is the aim of\r\n  marriage, alike among the Jews and among the Christians), if matters\r\n  were to be equalized as completely as possible, it would be necessary\r\n  for two men always to have one wife in common: let them take her when\r\n  they are both young. After she has become faded, let them take another\r\n  young woman, who will then suffice for their needs until both the men\r\n  are old. Both women are cared for, and each man is responsible for the\r\n  care of one only.\r\n\r\n  “In the monogamic state, the man has for a single occasion too much,\r\n  and for a permanency too little; with the woman it is the other way\r\n  about.\r\n\r\n  “If the proposed institution were adopted in youth, a man, at the\r\n  time when his income is usually smallest, would have to provide only\r\n  for half a wife, and for few children, and those young. Later, when he\r\n  is richer, he would have to provide for one or two wives and for\r\n  numerous children.\r\n\r\n  “Since this institution has not been adopted--for half their life men\r\n  are whoremongers, and for the other half cuckolds; and women must be\r\n  correspondingly classified as betrayed and betrayers--he who marries\r\n  young is tied later to an elderly wife; he who marries late in youth\r\n  acquires venereal disease, and in age has to wear the horns. Woman\r\n  must either sacrifice the bloom of her youth to a man already\r\n  withered; or else must discover that to a still vigorous man she is no\r\n  longer an object of desire. The institution we propose would cure all\r\n  these troubles; the human race would lead happier lives. The\r\n  objections are the following:\r\n\r\n  “1. That a man would not know his own children. Answer: This could, as\r\n  a rule, be determined by likeness and other considerations; in\r\n  existing conditions it is not always a matter of certainty.\r\n\r\n  “2. Such a _menage à trois_ would give rise to brawls and jealousy.\r\n  Answer: Such things are already universal; people must learn to behave\r\n  themselves.\r\n\r\n  “3. What is to be done as regards property? Answer: This will have to\r\n  be otherwise arranged; absolute _communio bonorum_ will not occur. As\r\n  we have already said, Nature has arranged the affair badly. It will,\r\n  therefore, be impossible to overcome all disadvantages.\r\n\r\n  “As matters are at present, Duty and Nature are continually in\r\n  conflict. For the man it is impossible from the beginning to the end\r\n  of his career to satisfy his sexual impulse in a legal manner. Imagine\r\n  his condition if he is widowed quite young. For the woman, to be\r\n  limited to a =single= man during the short period of her full bloom\r\n  and sexual capacity, is an unnatural condition. She has to preserve\r\n  for the use of one individual what he is unable to utilize, and what\r\n  many others eagerly desire from her; and she herself, in thus\r\n  refusing, must curb her own desires. Just think of it!\r\n\r\n  “More especially we have to remember that always the number of men\r\n  competent for sexual intercourse is double the number of functionally\r\n  capable women, for which reason every woman must continually repel\r\n  advances; she prepares for defence immediately a man comes near her.”\r\n\r\nWhen we consider this suggestion of tetragamy of Schopenhauer’s from our\r\nown standpoint, we find an accurate exposition of the evils arising from\r\nmonogamic coercive marriage, and a clear-sighted presentation of the\r\nphysiological disharmonies of the sexual life arising from the\r\ndifference between man and woman, upon which recently Metchnikoff also\r\nhas laid so much stress. In other respects Schopenhauer’s views are for\r\nus not open to discussion, for, as already pointed out, he regards woman\r\nfrom the first simply as a chattel, and denies to her any individuality\r\nor soul; and, secondly, because he rejects the principle of the\r\n=only-love=--a principle so intimately associated with the idea of woman\r\nas individual. For the watchword of the future must be: Free love, based\r\nupon the only-love! and, indeed, the only-love manifesting itself\r\nreciprocally in the full struggle for existence.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, also, the characteristic free love of the Bohemians of\r\nParis during the second half of the nineteenth century, and more\r\nespecially during the period 1830 to 1860, can only be regarded as a\r\ntruly poetic love-idyll, when compared with that grand and earnest love\r\nconsecrated wholly to =work=, and to the =inward spiritual development=\r\nwhich presents itself to modern humanity as an ideal love, as the united\r\nconquest of existence. Grisette love, which Sebastian Mercier described\r\nwith great force, and which found its classic representation in Henry\r\nMurger’s “Vie de Bohème,” was characterized by the enduring\r\nlife-in-common of the loving couples, who belonged for the most part to\r\nthe circle of artists and students. Thus it stood high as heaven above\r\nour modern “intimacy,” which, for the most part, has a quite transitory\r\ncharacter; and yet the Bohemian free love corresponded in no way to the\r\nconception and ideal of free love as a community of spirit and of life.\r\n\r\nThe development of modern civilization, in association with the\r\nawakening of individualism, and with the economic revolution of our\r\ntime, has created entirely new foundations for sexual relationships, and\r\nhas made continually more apparent the injurious and destructive effects\r\nof our long outworn sexual morality. These changes have taught us to\r\nunderstand that in the so-called social question the sexual problem\r\npossesses as much importance as the economic problem--perhaps more. They\r\nhave shown us the necessity for a new love of the future, for the reason\r\nthat to cling to the old, outlived forms would be equivalent to a\r\ncontinuous increase in sexual corruption in the widest sense of the\r\nword, combined with a general disease contamination of civilized\r\nnations--as the threatening spread of prostitution, and more especially\r\nof secret prostitution, and the increased diffusion of venereal\r\ndiseases, demonstrate before our eyes.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same time, during recent years, among the various\r\ncivilized nations of Europe there have originated efforts for a radical\r\ntransformation of conventional sexual morality, and for a reform,\r\nadapted to modern conditions, of marriage and of the entire amatory\r\nlife. In France, England, Sweden, and Germany, writers have appeared,\r\nproducing books, many of which have been important, full of matter, and\r\ncomprehensive, entirely devoted to this object. Societies for marriage\r\nreform and sexual reform have been founded in North America, France,\r\nAustria, and Germany; parliamentary commissions for the investigation of\r\nthese questions have been established. Several newspapers have been\r\nfounded for the reform of sexual ethics. In short, a general interest\r\nhas been aroused in this central question of life, and theoretical and\r\npractical activity have been directed towards its solution.\r\n\r\nAll at once, as if by general agreement, civilized humanity asked itself\r\nthe earnest and solemn question, How was it possible that to hundreds\r\nand thousands the simple right to love was refused, so that they were\r\ncondemned to a joyless existence, in which all the beautiful blossoms of\r\nlife withered away; that hundreds of thousands of others were condemned\r\nto the hideous misery of prostitution; that, finally, the =community at\r\nlarge= was delivered up in ever-increasing degree to devastation by\r\nvenereal diseases and their consequences?\r\n\r\nHow is it possible, asks Karl Federn, in the preface to his translation\r\nof Carpenter’s “Wenn die Menschen reif zur Liebe werden” (“Love’s\r\nComing-of-Age”)--how is it possible that we sing love-songs, and yet\r\nhave an amatory life like that which we lead to-day, and have a moral\r\ndoctrine such as that which is dominant to-day?\r\n\r\nAll honour to the men and women who have dared to give an answer to\r\nthese questions, who have opposed conventional lies with the truth of\r\nlove, and who point out the new way along which mankind will go--will\r\ngo, because it =must=.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible here to mention by name all the writings dealing with\r\nthe reform of sexual relationships which have appeared within recent\r\nyears. Their name is legion. We must content ourselves with an allusion\r\nto those books which most of all deserve the name of epoch-making, which\r\nhave aroused the interest of the community, and which may probably be\r\nsaid to have first stimulated the discussion of the problem, and to have\r\nbeen principally effective in starting the flowing current of reform.\r\n\r\nIn France, Charles Albert has treated the problem of free love from the\r\ncommunistic standpoint.[198] In the first two chapters of his book, he\r\ndescribes the development of the primitive sexual impulse, to become\r\nthe most supreme individual love, and then gives an interesting account\r\nof the struggle of middle-class society against love, which to-day is\r\nendangered to an equal extent both by the =state= and by =capital=.\r\n\r\n  “Capitalistic society represents one fact, love another. It suffices\r\n  to place them one beside the other in order to notice how sharp a\r\n  contrast there is between them, an eternal state of war.”\r\n\r\nIt is only money that dominates the thought and feeling of modern\r\nhumanity; for love and its idealism there is no longer any room; social\r\neconomy recognizes only a sexual relationship, but not the higher\r\nfeeling of love. Capital subjects the whole of the sexual life to its\r\nlaws. In prostitution this great social crime finds its conclusion. The\r\nmajority of marriages are nothing more than “sexual bargains.”\r\n\r\nFree love is simply love liberated from the dominion of the state and of\r\ncapital. It can, therefore, be realized only by an economic revolution,\r\nwhich will put an end to the economic struggle for existence. Free love\r\nmeans the independence of the sexual from the material life. =Economic\r\nreform= is the only way to the higher love. This is the author’s\r\nconviction. But he is not subject to any deceptive delusion that with\r\nthis all will become beautiful and good; with this all problems will be\r\nsolved, all incompleteness at an end.\r\n\r\n  “We do not,” Albert continues, “regard the province of the sexual life\r\n  in the society of the future as an Eden, wherein those individuals\r\n  best suited one to the other will come together with mathematical\r\n  certainty, to lead a cloudless existence. Just as to-day, there will\r\n  be unrequited love, uncertain search and endeavour, errors and\r\n  deceptions, misunderstandings, satiety, aberrations, and sorrows.\r\n  However great the material prosperity may be which mankind in the\r\n  future will enjoy, the life of feeling will always remain the source\r\n  of incalculable disturbances, and love will not be the rarest cause of\r\n  such disturbances; but still a large proportion of the existing causes\r\n  of pain can and must disappear.”\r\n\r\nThe indispensable preliminary to free love is the complete equality of\r\nman and woman. This, however, can only be attained by means of\r\ncommunism--that is to say, by that ordering of society in which property\r\nand wages cease to exist, in which not only the means of production, but\r\nalso all the articles of consumption, are appropriated to the common\r\nuse, and woman will no longer possess a commercial value, as she does at\r\nthe present day.\r\n\r\nLike Albert, Ladislaus Gumplowicz[199] also believes that free love can\r\nonly be realized in a collectivist community.\r\n\r\nHowever important it is to draw attention to the economic point of view,\r\nas was done before Albert and Gumplowicz by Bebel, in his celebrated\r\n“Woman and Socialism” (thirty-fourth edition, Stuttgart, 1903), still,\r\nit appears to me that the communistic solution is not the only possible\r\nsolution, and that free love can very well be associated with the\r\npreservation of private property.[200]\r\n\r\nWhile the progressive changes in the economic structure of society\r\npowerfully influence sexual relationships and lay down the rules for\r\ntheir existing forms, still, physiological individual factors play a\r\ngreat part also in the matter. The first to insist on this fact were the\r\nEnglishman Carpenter and the Swedish writer Ellen Key.[201]\r\n\r\nEdward Carpenter,[202] at one time a priest in the Anglican Church, in\r\nhis study of the question of free love, without ignoring the economic\r\nfactor, lays stress above all on the psychical factor, the inward\r\nspiritual relationship between man and wife.\r\n\r\nHe writes (_op. cit._, p. 120):\r\n\r\n  “It is in the very nature of Love that as it realizes its own aim it\r\n  should rivet always more and more towards a durable and distinct\r\n  relationship, nor rest till the permanent mate and equal is found. As\r\n  human beings progress, their relations to each other must become much\r\n  =more= definite and distinct, instead of less so--and there is no\r\n  likelihood of society in its onward march lapsing backwards, so to\r\n  speak, to formlessness again.”\r\n\r\nAbove all, Carpenter has introduced into the discussion of free love an\r\nelement which to me appears of great importance from the medical\r\nstandpoint: the question of relative asceticism, of =self-control=. He\r\nrightly considers that the duty of the love of the future does not\r\nsubsist merely in the common physical union, but also in =spiritual\r\nprocreation=. From the intimate spiritual contact between two\r\ndifferentiated personalities, the highest spiritual values proceed. Only\r\nself-control leads us to this highest love.\r\n\r\n  “It is a matter of common experience that the unrestrained outlet of\r\n  merely physical desire leaves the nature drained of its higher\r\n  love-forces.... Any one who has once realized how glorious a thing\r\n  Love is in its essence, and how indestructible, will hardly need to\r\n  call anything that leads to it a sacrifice” (_op. cit._, pp. 7, 8).\r\n\r\nThe indispensable prerequisites to the reform of love and marriage are,\r\naccording to Carpenter, the following (_op. cit._, p. 100):\r\n\r\n  (1) The furtherance of the freedom and self-dependence of women. (2)\r\n  The provision of some rational teaching, of heart and of head, for\r\n  both sexes during the period of youth. (3) The recognition in marriage\r\n  itself of a freer, more companionable, and less pettily exclusive\r\n  relationship. (4) The abrogation or modification of the present odious\r\n  law which binds people together for =life=, without scruple, and in\r\n  the most artificial and ill-assorted unions.\r\n\r\nCarpenter accepts Letourneau’s view, that, in a more or less distant\r\nfuture, the institution of marriage will undergo transformation into\r\nmonogamic unions, freely entered on, and when necessary freely\r\ndissolved, by simple mutual consent, as is already done in several\r\nEuropean countries--in Canton Geneva, in Belgium, in Roumania, as\r\nregards divorce; and in Italy as regards separation. State and society\r\nshould take part in the matter only so far as the safety of the children\r\ndemands, concerning whom =more extensive duties= should be expected from\r\nthe parents. Carpenter also points out, as was shown seventy years ago\r\nby Gutzkow, that, as regards the development of the children, it is\r\nbetter, in unhappy marriages, that their parents should separate than\r\nthat the children should grow up amid the miseries of such marriages.\r\n\r\n  “Love”--thus Carpenter concludes his dissertation on marriage in the\r\n  future--“is doubtless the last and most difficult lesson that humanity\r\n  has to learn; in a sense, it underlies all the others. Perhaps the\r\n  time has come for the modern nations when, ceasing to be children,\r\n  they may even try to learn it” (_op. cit._, p. 113).\r\n\r\nA greater vogue even than Carpenter’s book had was obtained by the\r\nessays of the Swedish writer Ellen Key, “Love and Marriage,” which in\r\n1894 appeared in a German translation,[203] and had an unusual success\r\nin the book-market. It is without exception the most interesting and\r\npregnant work on the sexual question which has ever appeared. Written\r\nfrom the heart, and inspired by the observations of a free and lofty\r\nspirit, it avoids none of the numerous difficulties and by-paths in this\r\ndepartment of thought; and the reproach of libertinism which has been\r\ncast at the author must be emphatically rejected. Ellen Key is the most\r\noutspoken realist of all the writers on the subject of free love. She\r\ntakes her arguments from actual life; she associates her ideas of reform\r\nalways with the real; she writes as an earnest evolutionist. Thus, in\r\nher book, her first aim is to establish “the course of the evolution of\r\nsexual morality” and the “evolution of love.”\r\n\r\nEllen Key starts from the fact that no one has ever offered any proof\r\nthat monogamy is that form of the sexual life which is =indispensable=\r\nto the vital force and civilization of the nations. Even among the\r\nChristian nations =it has never yet really existed=, and its\r\nlegalization as the only permissible form of sexual morality has\r\nhitherto been rather harmful than helpful to general morality.\r\n\r\nThe writer then develops the idea, no less beautiful than true, that the\r\ngenuine character of love can be proved only by the lovers actually\r\nliving together for a considerable time; only thus is it possible to\r\ndemonstrate that it is moral for them to live together, and that their\r\nunion will have an elevating influence on themselves and their\r\ngeneration. Consequently, of no conjugal relationship can we\r\n=beforehand= affirm or deny its success. Every new pair, whatever form\r\nthey may have chosen for their common life, =must first of all prove for\r\nthemselves that they are morally justified in living together=.\r\n\r\nEllen Key then proceeds to maintain a view, which I myself also regard\r\nas an integral constituent of the programme of the love of the future,\r\nand one which I have advanced in earlier writings: that love is not\r\nmerely, as Schopenhauer thought, an affair of the =species=, but is, at\r\nleast in equal degree, the concern of the loving =individuals=. This is\r\nthe result and the meaning of civilization, which, as I have proved in\r\nearlier chapters, exhibits a =progressive= individualization and an\r\nincreasing spiritual enrichment of love (the “spiritualized sensuality”\r\nof Ellen Key), and thus gives to love a thoroughly independent\r\nimportance for each individual.\r\n\r\n  “In view of the manner in which civilization has now developed\r\n  personal love, this latter has become so composite, so comprehensive\r\n  and far-reaching, that =not only in and by itself=--independently of\r\n  the species--=does it constitute a great life-value, but it also\r\n  increases or diminishes all other values=. In addition to its\r\n  primitive importance, it has gained a new significance: to carry the\r\n  flame of life from sex to sex. No one names that person immoral who,\r\n  deceived in his love, abstains in his married life from procreating\r\n  the species; that husband and wife also we shall not call immoral, who\r\n  continue their married life rendered happy by love, although their\r\n  marriage has proved childless. But in both cases =these human beings\r\n  follow their subjective feelings at the expense of the future\r\n  generations, and treat their love as an independent aim=. The right\r\n  already recognized in these individual cases, as belonging to the\r\n  individual at the expense of the species, will continue to undergo\r\n  enlargement in proportion as the importance of love continues to\r\n  increase. On the other hand, the new morality will demand from love an\r\n  ever-increasing =voluntary limitation of rights at those times when\r\n  the growth of a new life renders it necessary=. It will also demand a\r\n  =voluntary or enforced renunciation of the right to procreate new life\r\n  under conditions which would make this new life deficient in value=.”\r\n\r\nEllen Key terms this new, modern love “erotic monism,” because it\r\ncomprehends the =entire unitary personality=, including the spiritual\r\nbeing, not merely the body. George Sand gave the first definition of\r\nthis love as being of such a kind that “neither had the soul betrayed\r\nthe senses, nor had the senses betrayed the soul.”\r\n\r\nThis erotic monism proclaims as its indestructible foundation the =unity\r\nof marriage and love=.\r\n\r\nThe idea of unity gives to the human being the right to arrange his\r\nsexual life according to his personal wishes, subject to the condition\r\nthat he does not consciously injure the unity, and therewith, mediately\r\nor immediately, the right, of possible posterity.\r\n\r\nThus, according to Ellen Key, love “=will continually become to a\r\ngreater extent a private affair of human beings, whilst children, on the\r\ncontrary, will become more and more a vital problem of society=.” From\r\nthis it follows that the two “most debased and socially sanctioned\r\nmanifestations of sexual subdivision (of dualism), =coercive marriage=\r\nand =prostitution=, will gradually become =impossible=, because, after\r\nthe victory of the idea of unity, they will cease to correspond to human\r\nneeds.”\r\n\r\nEllen Key rightly insists that among the young men of the present day\r\nthere is an increasing hostility to socially protected immorality (both\r\nin the form of coercive marriage and in that of prostitution); whilst\r\nthey increasingly exhibit a monistic yearning for love. The general\r\ndiffusion, which we shall describe at length in a special chapter, of\r\nascetic moods and of misogyny among men and of misandry among women, is\r\npartly connected with the feeling that the present social forms of the\r\nsexual relationship limit to an equal extent the worth and the freedom\r\nof mankind.\r\n\r\nTo-day the “purity fanatics and the frantic sensualists” meet in common\r\nmistrust of the developmental possibilities of love, because they do not\r\nbelieve in the possible ennoblement of the blind natural impulse. In\r\ncontrast to these, Ellen Key reminds us of the fact of the “mystical\r\n=yearning for perfection=, which in the course of evolution has raised\r\nimpulse to become passion, and passion to become love, and which is now\r\nstriving =to raise love to an ever greater love=.”\r\n\r\nWe must recognize love as =the spiritual force of life=. Love, like the\r\nartist, like the man of science, has a right to the peculiar, original\r\nactivity of its own poietic force, to the production of new spiritual\r\nvalues. The more perfect race that is to come must, in the fullest\r\nmeaning of the words, =be brought forth by love=.\r\n\r\nFor this, however, the indispensable preliminary is the inward =freedom=\r\nof love; the free-love union is the watchword of the future. Ellen Key\r\nalso shows that among the lower classes free love has long been\r\ncustomary, and that there the dangerous utilization of prostitution is\r\nfar more limited than among the higher classes, with which view\r\nBlaschko’s statistical data regarding the far greater diffusion of\r\nvenereal diseases among the higher classes of society are in substantial\r\nagreement.\r\n\r\nNo less indispensable to free love, however, is the full, mature\r\ndevelopment of the loving individual. For this reason, Ellen Key demands\r\nself-control and sexual continence at least until the age of twenty\r\nyears. She regards the indiscriminate sexual intercourse which is to-day\r\nan established custom among all young men as the murder of love. But too\r\nearly marriages are no less dangerous. She demands for the woman at\r\nleast an age of twenty; for the man, an age of twenty-five years; and\r\n=until these respective ages are attained, sexual continence should be\r\nobserved as fully as possible by both sexes=.\r\n\r\nThis self-command is good for the physical development, “steels the\r\nwill, gives the joy of power to the personality; and these qualities are\r\nlater of importance in all other spheres of activity.”\r\n\r\nWith wonderful beauty, Ellen Key describes the happiness of the =power\r\nof waiting= in love, and quotes in this connexion the lovely phrases of\r\nthe Swedish poet Karlfeldt:\r\n\r\n  “There is nothing on earth like the times of waiting,\r\n   The days of springtime, the days of blossoming;\r\n   Not even May can diffuse a light\r\n   Like the clear light of April.”\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is a demand of true morality that healthy men and\r\nwomen between the ages of twenty and thirty years should enjoy the\r\npossibility of marriage--of free marriage. This possibility can,\r\nhowever, be secured only by economic reforms.\r\n\r\nThe author then considers the very important point of love’s choice, and\r\ndemands above all the compulsory provision of a =medical certificate of\r\nhealth= before entering on marriage.\r\n\r\n  “It is absolutely beyond question that the healthy self-seeking which\r\n  wishes to safeguard the personal ego, in conjunction with the\r\n  increasing valuation of a healthy posterity, will hinder the\r\n  contraction of many unsuitable marriages. In other cases, love might\r\n  overcome these considerations, as far as husband and wife are\r\n  themselves concerned; but they must then renounce parentage. In those\r\n  cases, on the contrary, in which the law would distinctly forbid\r\n  marriage, one could naturally not prevent the sick persons from\r\n  procreating independently of marriage; but the same is true of all\r\n  laws: the best do not need them, the worst do not obey them, but the\r\n  majority are guided by them in the formation and development of their\r\n  ideas of what is right.”\r\n\r\nAs =immoral=, Ellen Key indicates:\r\n\r\n  “Parentage without love.\r\n\r\n  “Irresponsible parentage.\r\n\r\n  “Parentage on the part of immature or degenerate human beings.\r\n\r\n  “Voluntary unfertility on the part of a married pair who are competent\r\n  to reproduce their kind.\r\n\r\n  “All manifestations of the sexual life resulting from force or\r\n  seduction, or from the disinclination or the incapacity for the proper\r\n  fulfilment of sexual intercourse.”\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that Ellen Key prophesies as the result of the\r\nprogressive improvement of the species by love’s selection, the\r\nattainment of a state wherein =every= man and =every= woman will be\r\nsuited for the reproduction of the species. Then would the ideal of\r\nmonogamy, one husband for one wife, one wife for one husband, be for the\r\nfirst time realized.\r\n\r\nVery beautifully, and with a prudent insight into the actual\r\nrelationships, Ellen Key discusses the question of the “right to\r\nmotherhood,” where she finds occasion to describe the new and very\r\nvarious types of women which the evolution of modern life has brought\r\ninto being. She recognizes only with reservation the general right to\r\nmotherhood, but she does not regard it as a desirable example to follow\r\nwhen a woman becomes a mother without love, either in marriage or out of\r\nit. It is not right to do what is generally done to-day by the\r\nman-haters--namely, to demand from the majority of unmarried women that\r\nthey should produce a child without love. This should not even happen\r\nwhen love exists, but a permanent life-in-common with the father of the\r\nchild is impossible. An unmarried woman who determines on motherhood\r\nshould be fully =mature=, and already have behind her “the second\r\nspringtime” of her life; she must “not only be pure as snow, pure as\r\nfire, but also must be possessed of the full conviction that with the\r\nchild of her love she will produce a radiance in her own life and will\r\nendow humanity with new wealth.”\r\n\r\n=Such= an unmarried woman really =makes a present= of her child to\r\nhumanity, and is quite different from the unmarried woman who “has a\r\nchild.”\r\n\r\nIndeed, for the =majority=, the ideal always remains that of the ancient\r\nproverb, that man is only half a human being, woman only half; and only\r\nthe father and the mother with their child become a whole one!\r\n\r\nWith regard to divorce, Ellen Key demands that it should be perfectly\r\nfree, and should depend only upon the definite desire, held for a\r\ncertain lapse of time, of either or both parties. The dissolution of\r\nmarriage must be no less easy than the breaking off of an engagement.\r\n\r\n  “Whatever drawbacks,” she says, “free divorce may involve, they can\r\n  hardly be worse than those which marriage has entailed, and still\r\n  continues to entail. Marriage has been degraded to the coarsest sexual\r\n  customs, the most shameless practices, the most distressing spiritual\r\n  murders, the most cruel ill-treatment, and the grossest impairment of\r\n  personal freedom, that any province of modern life has exhibited! One\r\n  need not go back to the history of civilization; one need simply turn\r\n  to the physician and magistrate, in order to learn for what purpose\r\n  the ‘sacrament of marriage’ is employed, and frequently employed by\r\n  the very same men and women who are professed enthusiasts as to its\r\n  moral value!”\r\n\r\nJust as little as the relations between friends, between parents and\r\nchildren, or between brothers and sisters, necessarily give rise to\r\nlasting sentiments of affection, is it possible to expect this of two\r\nlovers. The “marriage fetters,” described with such horrible truth by\r\nJohn Stuart Mill and Björnstjerne Björnsen, are to-day felt to be\r\nintolerable. The love of the modern man flourishes only in freedom.\r\n\r\n  “The delicate erotic sentiment of the present day shrinks from\r\n  becoming a fetter; it shuns the possibility of becoming a hindrance.”\r\n\r\nFree divorce, in a case of unhappy marriage, is no less necessary when\r\nthere are children to the marriage. The =duties= of the parents to the\r\nchildren remain in such cases unaltered, without, however, thus\r\nrendering it necessary that the parents should continue to live\r\ntogether. For the sorrows of such a union, and the harm done thereby to\r\nthe children, are greater than those that would result from divorce.\r\n\r\nHuman love has its phases of development. It does not remain for ever\r\nthe same, but it alters _pari passu_ with the evolution of the\r\nindividual. Lifelong love is an ideal, but it is not a duty. Such a\r\ndemand would as inevitably destroy personality as would the demand for\r\nthe unconditional belief in a doctrine, or for the unconditional pursuit\r\nof a profession.\r\n\r\nVery interesting is Ellen Key’s description of the numerous disillusions\r\nof love, which become still more perceptible in a coercive marriage.\r\nThere is a whole series of “typical unhappy fates” in marriage, often\r\nwith no blame properly attaching to either party, dependent merely upon\r\nincompatibility of temperament, but also upon faults of one or both\r\nparties to the marriage.\r\n\r\nFrequently a man or a woman of a thoroughly sympathetic temperament\r\nlives with a woman or a man of such faultless excellence that the home\r\nseems filled with icicles. One day the husband or the wife runs away\r\nbecause the air has become so thin as to be irrespirable. The general\r\nsentiment is one of commiseration for the--superlatively excellent man\r\nor woman!\r\n\r\nIn the case of earnest, mature human beings, free divorce will not\r\nincrease the number of dissolutions of marriage. On the contrary, the\r\nobligations imposed by a free relationship are greater than those of\r\nlegal coercive marriage. The fear also that with the granting of free\r\ndivorce every one will enter upon numerous free marriages one after\r\nanother is groundless. It is precisely those who are united in free love\r\nto whom such a separation, when it does become necessary, is so\r\nprofoundly painful, that life itself forbids the frequent repetition of\r\nsuch unhappiness.\r\n\r\nVery beautiful, and based upon lofty ethical conceptions, are the\r\nwriter’s views regarding the necessity for divorce precisely in view of\r\nthe existence of children. She says:\r\n\r\n  “Men and women of earlier times went on patching up for ever and ever.\r\n  The psychologically developed generation of to-day is more inclined to\r\n  let the broken remain broken. For, except in those cases in which\r\n  objective misfortunes, or a retarded evolution, gave rise to a\r\n  rupture, patched-up marriage, like patched-up engagements, seldom\r\n  prove durable. Often it was owing to profound instincts that the\r\n  rupture became inevitable; reconciliations fortify these instincts,\r\n  and sooner or later they once more find free vent.\r\n\r\n  “Thus it happens that even an exceptional nature is strained by the\r\n  burden it has to bear, and the children are not then witnesses of\r\n  their parents living together, but of their dying together.\r\n\r\n  “Neither religion nor law, neither society nor a family, can determine\r\n  what it is that marriage is killing in a man, or what he finds it\r\n  possible to rescue in that state--=he himself alone= knows the one and\r\n  suspects the other. He alone can delineate the boundaries, can decide\r\n  whether he is satisfied to regard his own existence as closed, and to\r\n  remain contented in the life of his children; whether he is able so to\r\n  endure the sorrows of a continued married life with such fortitude as\r\n  to make it increase his own powers and those of his children.”\r\n\r\nThe conviction of the rights of love, and the consciousness of the\r\nrights of the children, are to-day unmistakably on the increase. There\r\nis no danger that the latter right, the right of the children, will\r\nsuffer in comparison with the rights of love. It is, on the contrary,\r\ncharacteristic, that out of the very same feeling by which the freer\r\nconfiguration of the amatory life is demanded, there has also arisen a\r\n=new programme of the rights of children=. This same Ellen Key who\r\nproclaims the inalienable rights of free love, speaks also of the\r\n“=century of the child=,” and devotes to this subject an admirable book.\r\n\r\nThe most important point with regard to free divorce, in respect to the\r\nchildren, is that the father and the mother must not separate from one\r\nanother in hatred, but in friendship, and that, in the interest of the\r\nchildren, they should continue to meet one another from time to time.\r\nEllen Key here rightly condemns the conduct of the good friends and\r\nrelatives who simply lay down the law that the separated pair must hate\r\none another, and must in every relationship torment and cheat one\r\nanother. It is precisely such “enmity” of the parents after divorce that\r\nis so full of bad consequences in respect of the children.\r\n\r\nWe also have to consider this point of view, that sometimes the new\r\nhusband or the new wife has a better influence over the children than\r\ntheir own parents, and that in this way divorce may have brought the\r\nchildren greater happiness, may have been for them a true blessing.\r\n\r\nThe closing chapter of her work is devoted by Ellen Key to the\r\nformulation of practical recommendations regarding the new marriage\r\nlaws. She indicates as a starting-point of her dissertation that the\r\nideal form of marriage is the perfectly free union between a man and a\r\nwoman. But this ideal can in the meanwhile only be attained through\r\n=transitional forms=. In this the opinion of society regarding the\r\nmorality of the sexual relationship must find expression, and thus\r\nremain as the support for undeveloped personalities; but at the same\r\ntime, these transitional forms must be sufficiently free to favour a\r\nprogressive development of the higher erotic consciousness of the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nThere always remains, therefore, the necessity for laws, to some extent\r\nlimiting individual freedom; but these laws must admit of an advance\r\ntowards perfection in respect of the freer gratification of individual\r\nneeds. =The sense of solidarity demands a new marriage law adapted to\r\nnew modern erotic needs, since the majority are not yet prepared for\r\ncomplete freedom.= But it is only the needs of modern civilized human\r\nbeings, and not abstract theories concerning the idea of the family or\r\nthe “historic origin” of marriage, that should be determinative in this\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nIn the marriage of the future, above all, the economic and legal\r\nsubordination of woman must be abolished. Woman must supervise her own\r\nproperty and arrange her own work, and she must in the main care for\r\nherself in so far as this is compatible with her maternal duties. She\r\nmust, however, have this assurance--that =during the first years of the\r\nlife of every child she shall be cared for by society=, and this under\r\nthe following conditions:\r\n\r\nShe must be of full age.\r\n\r\nShe must have performed her feminine “military service” by a one year’s\r\ncourse of instruction in the care of children, in the general care of\r\nhealth, and, whenever possible, in sick-nursing.\r\n\r\nShe must either care for her child herself or provide another thoroughly\r\ncompetent nurse.\r\n\r\nShe must bring proof that she does not possess sufficient personal\r\nproperty, or sufficient income from her work, in order to provide for\r\nher own support and half of her child’s support, or else that the care\r\nfor her children compels her to discontinue her professional occupation.\r\n\r\nOnly in exceptional cases should this support of motherhood be provided\r\nfor a longer time than =during the three first and most important years\r\nof the life of the child=.\r\n\r\nThe funds for this most necessary of all kinds of insurance must be\r\nprovided in the form of a graduated income tax, graduated so as to make\r\nthe wealthier classes pay the most, and the =unmarried= should pay just\r\nas much as the married.\r\n\r\nIn every community the central authorities of this insurance should\r\nconsist of “=boards for the care of children=.” The members of these\r\nboards should be two-thirds women and one-third men; they should\r\ndistribute the funds and supervise the care of the infants and older\r\nchildren; in cases in which the mother was not properly fulfilling her\r\nduties to the child, they could cut off supplies, or remove the child\r\nfrom the mother’s care.\r\n\r\nThe mother should receive yearly the same sum, but, in addition, she\r\nshould receive for each child =half of the cost of its support=, as long\r\nas the number of children is not exceeded which the society has laid\r\ndown as desirable. Children born in excess of this number would be a\r\nprivate concern of the parents. Every father must, from the time of\r\nbirth until the child attains the age of =eighteen years=, provide\r\none-half of the money needed for its support.\r\n\r\nThe existing immoral distinction between legitimate and illegitimate\r\nchildren is practically equivalent to freeing unmarried fathers from\r\ntheir natural responsibility, and drives unmarried mothers to death,\r\nprostitution, or infanticide.\r\n\r\nAll this would be done away with by a law ensuring from the State\r\nsupport for the mother during the first, most difficult years, and\r\nensuring the child a right to support from =both= parents, a right also\r\nto the name of both, and to inheritance from both.\r\n\r\nLegal expression is also demanded for the right of each member of a\r\nmarried couple to possess his or her property; those who wish to make\r\nany other arrangement can do so by special contract after a definite\r\nvaluation of their property. And in respect of the right of inheritance,\r\nthe =domestic work= of the wife (housekeeping and the care of the\r\nchildren) must receive due economic consideration--a matter hitherto\r\nignored. Not only in respect of her property, but also in respect of all\r\ncivil rights, and of the right of control over her own person, the\r\nmarried woman must be placed in the same position as the unmarried.\r\n\r\nEllen Key’s remarks on the removal of the =coercion= exercised at\r\npresent on husband and wife =in respect of living together= are very\r\ninteresting. She writes:\r\n\r\n  “There are persons who would have continued to love one another\r\n  throughout the whole of their life had they not been compelled--day\r\n  after day, year after year--to adapt their customs, their volitions,\r\n  and their inclinations entirely according to one another’s tastes. So\r\n  much unhappiness depends, indeed, upon matters of almost no\r\n  importance, difficulties which two human beings endowed with moral\r\n  courage and insight would easily have overcome, had it not been that\r\n  the instinct towards happiness was overpowered by regard for ordinary\r\n  opinion. The more personal freedom a woman (or man) has had before\r\n  marriage, the more does she (or he) suffer in a home in which she does\r\n  not possess an hour or a corner for her own undisturbed use. And the\r\n  more the modern human being gains an increase in his individual\r\n  freedom of movement, the more he feels the need for privacy in other\r\n  relations, the more also will man and wife need these things in the\r\n  married state....\r\n\r\n  “But at present custom (and law) demand from the married pair that\r\n  they should lead a life in common, which often ends in a permanent\r\n  separation, merely because conventional considerations prevented them\r\n  from living apart!\r\n\r\n  “Also for those otherwise constituted, the narrow dependence, the\r\n  compulsory belonging each to the other, the daily adaptation, the\r\n  unceasing mutual consideration, may become oppressive. In continually\r\n  increasing numbers people are beginning quietly to transform conjugal\r\n  customs, so that they may correspond to the new needs. For instance,\r\n  each goes for a journey by himself, when he feels the need for\r\n  privacy; one of the pair seeks alone pleasures which the other does\r\n  not value; in former times both would have ‘enjoyed’ them together,\r\n  against the will of one, or both would have renounced what one could\r\n  have genuinely enjoyed. More and more married people have separate\r\n  bedrooms, and after a generation, it is probable that =separate\r\n  dwelling-houses= for husband and wife will be sufficiently common to\r\n  arouse no particular attention.”\r\n\r\nWith regard to the question of personal freedom in marriage, Ellen Key\r\ntakes into account the possibility of marriage being =kept secret= on\r\nurgent grounds; also the introduction of new forms of divorce, the\r\npresent procedure giving rise to such detestable practices in the\r\nlaw-courts--for example, the detailed statement of the grounds for\r\ndivorce, or an account of the refusal or the misuse of “conjugal\r\nrights,” or an account of the malicious desertion of one party by the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe author, therefore, makes proposals for a new marriage law and a new\r\ndivorce law.\r\n\r\nAs conditions preliminary to marriage, the new law should insist--\r\n\r\nThat man and wife should be of full age;\r\n\r\nThat neither should be more than twenty-five years older than the other;\r\n\r\nThat neither should be closely related or connected with the other, as\r\nthe present law already forbids. The new law must in this respect be\r\nmodified in the sense either of greater severity or of relaxation,\r\naccording as the scientific knowledge of the future may direct.\r\n\r\nFinally, neither party should simultaneously enter upon another\r\nmarriage. On both parties will be imposed the duty of providing a\r\nmedical certificate regarding the state of their health; a proposed\r\nmarriage must be forbidden when either party is suffering from a disease\r\ntransmissible to the children (also when suffering from a disease which\r\nwould infect the other party?). With regard to other illnesses, the\r\nmatter may be left to the free judgment of those wishing to be married.\r\n\r\nMarriage will take place before the marriage assessor of the commune,\r\nand before four other witnesses, without any special ceremony; the\r\ncontracting parties will enter their names in the register, and their\r\nsignatures will be witnessed by those present. When for any reason the\r\nmarriage is to be kept secret, the witnesses will, of course, be bound\r\nto secrecy.\r\n\r\nThis civil marriage is all that the law will direct; the religious\r\nceremony will be a voluntary affair, and will have no legal force.\r\n\r\nIn marriage, husband and wife will retain all the =personal= rights\r\nwhich they had before marriage, over their bodies, their names, their\r\nproperty, their work, their wages, also the right to choose their own\r\nplace of residence, and all other civil rights. For =common= expenses\r\nand debts they will have a common responsibility; whilst each will be\r\npersonally responsible for personal expenditure and debts. In case of\r\ndivorce, each will retain his or her property. In the event of death,\r\nthe widower or widow will inherit half the property, the remainder going\r\nto the children.\r\n\r\nFor divorce, Ellen Key suggests there should be a “=council of\r\ndivorce=,” consisting of four persons, men or women. The first aim of\r\nthis council will be, somewhat like that of a court of honour before a\r\nduel, to attempt to reconcile the parties, to adjust any cause of\r\nquarrel. If this attempt fails, the matter must go before the marriage\r\nassessor of the commune; but this cannot take place until the expiration\r\nof =six months= from the time when it was brought before the council of\r\ndivorce. The council of divorce must testify before the assessor that\r\nsix months before =each party was fully informed regarding the wish of\r\nthe other that the marriage should be dissolved, and regarding the\r\nreasons for that wish=. If there are no children, if a division of the\r\nproperty has been arranged, and if husband and wife have lived\r\n=completely apart= for one year, the divorce will be effected one year\r\nafter the commencement of proceedings. When there are children to the\r\nmarriage, there will be needed a special “=jury for the care of\r\nchildren=” to deal with the custody of the children. If either party is\r\nfound by the jury and the judge to be =unworthy= for or =incapable= of\r\nthe custody of the children, on the ground of his (or her) =morals= or\r\n=character=, he (or she) loses his (or her) rights. If either father or\r\nmother is deprived of the custody of the children, a guardian must be\r\nappointed--a man to represent the father, a woman to represent the\r\nmother--and this guardian will supervise the education of the children\r\nin association with the remaining parent. If both parents are found to\r\nbe unfitted for the custody of the children, the education of the latter\r\nmust be supervised by a guardian only. If both parents are =equally=\r\nfitted and worthy for the custody of the children, the latter should\r\nremain with the mother until the age of fifteen, and would then have the\r\nright to choose between their parents.\r\n\r\nEllen Key demands severe laws against the seduction and abandonment of\r\ngirls =under age=, on the part of unconscientious men; and she considers\r\nthat the witting transmission of any infective disorder by means of\r\nsexual intercourse should be punished by imprisonment for a minimum term\r\nof six months. Speaking generally, the law should always come to the\r\nassistance of the weaker party, above all, to the assistance of the\r\nchildren, and in most cases to the assistance of the mother.\r\n\r\nAlthough the new marriage law is to give to =adult= citizens complete\r\nfreedom to arrange their erotic relationships at their own\r\n=responsibility= and risk, =with= or =without= marriage, it remains\r\nnecessary that double marriages (bigamy), sexual relationships within\r\nforbidden degrees, or on the part of persons suffering from\r\ntransmissible disease, which the law has declared to be a hindrance to\r\nmarriage, and also intercourse with persons under eighteen years of age,\r\nshould be regarded as punishable offences. The same is true of\r\nhomosexual and other perverse manifestations. The =trial= in such cases\r\nwill be conducted by a judge, with the assistance of a jury of\r\n=physicians= and =crimino-psychologists=.\r\n\r\nThe writer does not believe that marriage will be transformed by legal\r\nchanges in the way outlined above, but she is of opinion that what will\r\nhappen is that “men and women will refuse to submit themselves to the\r\nunworthy forms of marriage, which will remain established by law, and\r\nwill form free unions, the so-called ‘=marriage of conscience=,’” such\r\nas those which the Belgian sociologist Mesnil has recommended in his\r\nwork, “Le Libre Mariage.”\r\n\r\nIt is, in fact, in Sweden, Ellen Key’s fatherland, in which these free\r\nmarriages of conscience appear to have first obtained adherents. She\r\nrecords the free union of the professor of national economics at Lund,\r\nKnut Wicksell. Additional reports of free marriages in Sweden are given\r\nby the Swedish physician Anton Nyström.[204] He mentions among those who\r\nhave formed free unions, without legal or ecclesiastical ceremony, but\r\nsimply by public notification, in addition to the already mentioned\r\nuniversity professor, also the editor of a leading newspaper, a\r\nphysician and doctor of philosophy, and a candidate of philosophy. The\r\nlatter is engaged in study with his wife at the high school at Göteborg.\r\nIn February, 1904, they made a public announcement in the newspaper that\r\nthey were entering on a “marriage of conscience,” since they had a\r\nconscientious objection to the ecclesiastical form of marriage. The\r\nprincipal of the college wrote an address to the young couple, stating\r\nthat, although this union was not entered upon on immoral grounds, and\r\ntherefore could not be regarded as a punishable offence, still, such a\r\nfree union, unrecognized by the State, between man and woman, was not\r\ncompatible with the good order of society, that it was injurious to the\r\ngeneral ethical conception of the sacramental character of marriage, and\r\nalso constituted a dangerous example, which others might be led to\r\nimitate. The principal therefore urged the young people most earnestly\r\n“to place their union as soon as possible on a legitimate footing.” This\r\nexhortation, however, led to no result.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the University of Upsala was more free-thinking than that of\r\nGöteborg, for the above-mentioned professor and his wife were, for a\r\nlong time =after= they had become united in free love, matriculated\r\nstudents at the University of Upsala, and the university authorities\r\nfavoured them with no attention with regard to this matter.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, the public declaration of “free marriages” has also\r\nfound observance in other European countries. Thus, not long ago the\r\nauthor who writes under the pseudonym of “Roda-Roda” announced in the\r\nnewspapers his free union with the Baroness von Zeppelin; and in the\r\n_Vossische Zeitung_, No. 410, September 2, 1906, we find the following\r\nannouncement:\r\n\r\n  “Dr. Alfred Rahmer\r\n  Wilhelmine Ruth Rahmer\r\n  geb. Prinz-Flohr\r\n  Frei-Vermählte”\r\n  (Free-Wedlock).\r\n\r\nSimilar public announcements are reported from Holland. Moreover,\r\naccording to Nyström, it has since 1734 been legally established in\r\nSweden, that in certain cases engagement is =equivalent to\r\nmarriage=--namely, when the engaged woman becomes pregnant. “When a man\r\nimpregnates his fiancée, =the engagement becomes a marriage.... If the\r\nman refuse to go through the ceremony of marriage=, and wishes to break\r\noff the engagement, the woman is legally declared to be his wife, and\r\nenjoys full conjugal rights in his house.” So runs this law.\r\n\r\nWe can predict with certainty that the adherents of free marriage, the\r\nnumber of “marriage protestants,” as Ellen Key happily calls them, will\r\ncontinue to increase. To such will belong all those who have an equal\r\nantipathy to coercive marriage, to the debasing intercourse with\r\nprostitutes, and to the transient casual love, such as is experienced in\r\nordinary extra-conjugal sexual intercourse, the true “wild” love.\r\n\r\n  “It is only a question of time”--thus Ellen Key concludes her remarks\r\n  on marriage reform--“when the respect felt by society for the sexual\r\n  union will not depend upon the form of the life in common, by which\r\n  two human beings become parents, but only on the worth of the children\r\n  which these two are producing as new links in the chain of the\r\n  generations. Men and women will then devote to their spiritual and\r\n  physical preparation for sexual intercourse the same religious\r\n  earnestness that the Christians devote to the welfare of their souls.\r\n  No longer will divine laws regarding the morality of sexual\r\n  relationships be considered the mainstay of morality; in place of\r\n  these the desire to elevate the human race and a sense of personal\r\n  responsibility will be the safeguards of conduct. But the conviction\r\n  on the part of the parents =that the purpose of life is also their own\r\n  proper life--that is, that they do not exist only for the sake of\r\n  children=--should free them from certain other duties of conscience\r\n  which at present bind them in respect of children--above all, from the\r\n  duty of maintaining a union in which they themselves are perishing.\r\n  The home will perhaps become more than it is at present; something at\r\n  unity with the mother, something which--far from excluding the\r\n  father--carries within itself the germ of a new and higher ‘family\r\n  right.’...\r\n\r\n  “A greater and healthier will-to-live in respect of erotic feelings\r\n  and demands--this it is that our time needs! Here from the feminine\r\n  side real dangers threaten; and one of several ways in which these\r\n  dangers must be averted is by the construction of new forms of\r\n  marriage.\r\n\r\n  “Human material of ever higher worth and capable of higher\r\n  evolution--it is this which in the first place we have to create. If\r\n  we preserve coercive forms of the sexual life, the possibility of\r\n  doing this is a diminishing one; if we adopt free forms of the sexual\r\n  life, the possibility of doing it will increase. Not only because the\r\n  present time asks for more freedom are its demands full of promise,\r\n  but because those demands approximate ever more closely to the central\r\n  point of the problem--to the conviction that love is the principal\r\n  condition upon which depends the vital advance of the individual and\r\n  of humanity at large.”\r\n\r\nI have given such a lengthy analysis of Ellen Key’s book because, in the\r\nfirst place, in no other work do we find so lucid an exposition of all\r\nthe points needed for the consideration of the question of free love--an\r\nexposition based upon the richest experience of life and a really\r\nastonishing psychical knowledge of mankind, combined with the finest\r\nunderstanding of the subtle activities and sentiments of the loving\r\nsoul; and, in the second place, because as an actual fact--at any rate,\r\nin Germany--this book has formed the true starting-point of all\r\nendeavours towards the reform of sexual morality. Ellen Key’s “Ueber\r\nLiebe und Ehe” (“Love and Marriage”) is a demonstration of human rights\r\nin the matter of love; it is the evangel for those who have determined\r\nto harmonize love with all the changes and advances attendant on the\r\nevolution of civilization, and have resolved not to allow the forcible\r\nretardation of progress by conditions which were perhaps still tolerable\r\none hundred or two hundred years ago, but to-day are unconditionally\r\n=hostile to civilization=.\r\n\r\nIn Germany these endeavours have been centralized in the Bund für\r\nMutterschutz (the Association for the Protection of Mothers), founded in\r\nthe beginning of 1906, whose purpose it is to protect unmarried mothers\r\nand their children from economic and moral dangers, to counteract the\r\ndominant condemnation of such mothers, and thereby also indirectly to\r\nbring about the reform of the existing views on sexual morality. Those\r\nwho initiated this most important movement were indeed high-minded\r\nwomen. I mention, among many, only the names of Ruth Bré, Helene\r\nStöcker, Maria Lischnewska, Adele Schreiber, Gabriele Reuter, and\r\nHenriette Fürth.\r\n\r\nBy the preparatory committee to which Maria Lischnewska, Dr. Borgius,\r\nDr. Max Marcuse, Ruth Bré, and Dr. Helene Stöcker belonged, a committee\r\nmeeting was called on January 5, 1905, and the Association for the\r\nProtection of Mothers was founded, its programme having already received\r\nthe support of a number of leading personalities from all parts of the\r\nGerman Empire.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this committee, to which, besides the above-named members\r\nof the preparatory committee, there belonged Lily Braun, Georg Hirth,\r\nand Werner Sombart, a further committee was formed, the members of which\r\nwere: Alfred Blaschko, Iwan Bloch, Hugo Böttger, Lily Braun, Gräfin\r\nGertrud Bülow von Dennewitz, M. G. Conrad, A. Damaschke, Hedwig Dohm,\r\nFrieda Duensing, Chr. v. Ehrenfels, A. Erkelenz, W. Erb, A. Eulenburg,\r\nMax Flesch, Flechsig, A. Forel, E. Francke, Henriette Fürth, Agnes\r\nHacker, Hegar, Willy Hellpach, Clara Hirschberg, Georg Hirth, Graf Paul\r\nvon Hoensbroech, Bianca Israel, Josef Kohler, Landmann, Hans Leuss,\r\nMaria Lischnewska, R. von Liszt, Lucas, Max Marcuse, Mensinga, Bruno\r\nMeyer, H. Meyer, Metta Meinken, Klara Muche, Moesta, A. Moll, Müller,\r\nFriedrich Naumann, A. Neisser, Franz Oppenheimer, Pelman, Alfred Ploetz,\r\nHeinrich Potthoff, Lydia Rabinowitsch, Gabriele Reuter, Karl Ries, Adele\r\nSchreiber, Heinrich Sohnrey, Werner Sombart, Helene Stöcker, Marie\r\nStritt, Irma von Troll-Borostyani, Max Weber, Bruno Wille, L. Wilser, L.\r\nWoltmann.\r\n\r\nIn the programme which the newly founded Association for the Protection\r\nof Mothers speedily published, we are told:\r\n\r\n  One hundred and eighty thousand illegitimate children are born in\r\n  Germany every year, approximately one-tenth of all births. This\r\n  important source of our strength as a people, children who at the time\r\n  of birth are usually endowed with powerful vitality (for their parents\r\n  are commonly in the bloom of youth and health), we allow to go to ruin\r\n  because a rigorous moral view bans unmarried mothers, undermines their\r\n  economic existence, and compels them to entrust their children for\r\n  payment to strange hands.\r\n\r\n  The momentous consequences of this state of affairs are shown by the\r\n  fact that the average number of still-births, in the case of\r\n  illegitimate children, amounts to 5 per cent., as compared with 3 per\r\n  cent. of still-births among the total number of births; the mortality\r\n  of illegitimate children during the first year of life is 28·5 per\r\n  cent., as compared with 16·7 per cent. for the mortality of all\r\n  children born. And whilst only a diminishing percentage of\r\n  illegitimate children ever become fitted for military service, the\r\n  world of criminals, prostitutes, and vagabonds, is recruited to an\r\n  alarming extent from their ranks. Thus, by unfounded moral prejudices,\r\n  we produce artificially an army of enemies to society. At the same\r\n  time the birth-rate of Germany is relatively declining. In the year\r\n  1876 the number of births per 1,000 living was 41; in the year 1900 it\r\n  was only 35-1/2!\r\n\r\n  To put an end to this robbery of the strength of our people is the aim\r\n  of the\r\n\r\n  ASSOCIATION FOR THE PROTECTION OF MOTHERS.\r\n\r\n  The attempt has already been made by means of crèches, foundling\r\n  institutions, and the like, to deal with this matter. =But the\r\n  protection of children without the protection of mothers is, and must\r\n  remain, no more than patchwork=; for the mother is the principal\r\n  source of life for the child, and is indispensable to the child’s\r\n  prosperity. Whatever ensures rest and care to the mother in her most\r\n  difficult hours, whatever secures her economic existence for the\r\n  future, and protects her from the contempt of her fellow-beings, by\r\n  which her health is endangered and her life embittered, will serve to\r\n  provide a secure foundation for the bodily and mental prosperity of\r\n  the child, and will simultaneously give the mother herself a stronger\r\n  moral hold. Therefore the Association for the Protection of Mothers\r\n  will, above all, make the mothers’ position safe, by assisting them\r\n  to the attainment of\r\n\r\n  ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE\r\n\r\n  --especially such as are prepared to bring up their own children--by\r\n  the formation in country and in town of\r\n\r\n  HOMES FOR MOTHERS,\r\n\r\n  in which, in addition, arrangements will be made for the necessary\r\n  care and upbringing of the children, the granting of legal protection,\r\n  and the provision of medical aid. Experience has shown that such\r\n  provision also corresponds to the wish of many of the fathers, and\r\n  assists in retaining their help and interest for mother and child.\r\n\r\n  The Association will, however, above all, close the sources from which\r\n  the present poverty of unmarried mothers arises, and these are more\r\n  especially the moral prejudices which at the present day defame them\r\n  socially, and the legal regulations which burden them almost\r\n  exclusively with the economic care and responsibility for the child,\r\n  and which entail on the father not at all, or in a quite insufficient\r\n  degree, his contribution to the burden.\r\n\r\n  THE MORAL DEFAMATION\r\n\r\n  of unmarried mothers would, perhaps, be comprehensible if we lived in\r\n  economic and social conditions rendering it possible for every one to\r\n  marry soon after attaining sexual maturity, so that the involuntary\r\n  celibacy of adult persons was an abnormal state. In such a time as\r\n  ours, however, in which no less than 45 per cent. of all women\r\n  competent to bear children are unmarried, and those who actually marry\r\n  do so for the most part at a comparatively late age, we must regard as\r\n  untenable the view which considers the unmarried woman giving birth to\r\n  a child to be an outcast, thrusts her out of society like the basest\r\n  criminal, and gives her up to despair. Equally untenable appears\r\n\r\n  THE PRESENT-DAY LEGAL VIEW,\r\n\r\n  which, when the actual father has not gone through the forms\r\n  prescribed by the State for a marriage, does not regard him as father\r\n  in the legal sense, ascribes to him no relationship with the child\r\n  procreated by him, and imposes on him no responsibility for the child\r\n  or its mother, although in the majority of cases the mother is\r\n  economically the weaker, and he himself economically the stronger\r\n  party. There must, therefore, be a legal reform in the direction of\r\n  equalizing as far as possible the position of the illegitimate and the\r\n  legitimate child in relation to the father.\r\n\r\n  Finally, however, motherhood--legitimate and illegitimate alike--is a\r\n  factor of such profound importance to society, that it appears\r\n  urgently desirable not to leave it exclusively to private care, with\r\n  all the results that private care entails. In the interest of the\r\n  community it is desirable that there should be\r\n\r\n  A GENERAL INSURANCE OF MOTHERHOOD,\r\n\r\n  the cost of which should be defrayed by contributions from both sexes,\r\n  as well as supplemented by grants from public sources. This assurance\r\n  must not only suffice to provide for every woman sufficient medical\r\n  assistance and skilled care during pregnancy and delivery, but should\r\n  also furnish a provision for the education of the child until it is of\r\n  an age to earn its own living.\r\n\r\n  In order to propagate these views and endeavours methodically and upon\r\n  the widest possible foundation, the active assistance and\r\n  participation of every class in the population is indispensable. We\r\n  therefore urge on all those who share our views the pressing demand\r\n\r\n  TO JOIN THE ASSOCIATION FOR THE PROTECTION OF MOTHERS,\r\n\r\n  and thus to assist in securing and accelerating the attainment of\r\n  these ends.\r\n\r\nAs the official organ of the Association, was chosen the monthly\r\nmagazine, edited by Dr. Phil. Helene Stöcker, _Mutterschutz: Zeitschrift\r\nzur Reform der Sexuellen Ethik_ (_The Protection of Mothers: a Journal\r\nfor the Reform of Sexual Ethics_)--hitherto published in the year 1905\r\ntwelve numbers, in the year 1906 twelve numbers, and in the year 1907\r\nthree numbers.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of the Association was followed on February 26, 1905, by\r\nthe holding of its first public meeting, in the Architektenhaus, under\r\nthe presidency of Helene Stöcker; and the meeting was extensively\r\nattended by the general population of Berlin. The aims and endeavours of\r\nthe new union were explained, in longer and shorter speeches, by Ruth\r\nBré, Max Marcuse, Maria Lischnewska, Justizrat Sello, Helene Stöcker,\r\nEllen Key, Lily Braun, Adele Schreiber, Iwan Bloch, and Bruno Meyer; and\r\nfrom the standpoint of the advocates of woman’s rights, of jurists, of\r\nphysicians, of sociologists, and of moralists, in equal degree, a\r\nradical transformation and reform of the present untenable conditions\r\nwas demanded.[205]\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards, the Association proceeded to form local groups. The\r\nfirst was formed in Munich, where on March 28, 1905, the first local\r\nmeeting took place. Frau Schönfliess, Margarethe Joachimsen-Böhm, Alfred\r\nScheel, and Friedrich Bauer belonged to this committee. Further local\r\ngroups were founded in Berlin (May 20, 1905--members of this committee,\r\nas distinct from the committee of the general Association: Finkelstein,\r\nGalli, Agnes Hacker, Albert Kohn, Bruno Meyer, Adele Schreiber), and in\r\nHamburg (president, Regina Ruben).[206]\r\n\r\nThe first general meeting (_cf._ Helene Stöcker, “Our First General\r\nMeeting,” published in _Mutterschutz_, 1907, No. 2) took place in\r\nBerlin, January 12 to 14. After speeches on the practical protection of\r\nmothers (Maria Lischnewska), the present-day form of marriage (Helene\r\nStöcker), prostitution and illegitimacy (Max Flesch), limitation of\r\nmarriages by economic conditions (Adele Schreiber), limitation of\r\nmarriage by hygienic factors (Max Marcuse), the position of the\r\nillegitimate child (Böhmert and Ottmar Spann), the insurance of\r\nmotherhood (Mayet), there followed animated discussions, and various\r\nimportant resolutions were passed, dealing with the equality of husband\r\nand wife in married life, the legal recognition of free marriages, and\r\nof the offspring of such marriages, the necessity for the provision of\r\ncertificates of health before the conclusion of marriage, the means to\r\nbe employed in the care of illegitimate children, and the insurance of\r\nmotherhood. Especially noteworthy was the address of the leading medical\r\nstatistician, Professor Mayet, regarding the introduction and management\r\nof the insurance of motherhood. At his suggestion, proposals followed\r\nregarding the enrolling of working-class members in the societies for\r\ninsurance against illness and for the insurance of motherhood, the\r\nnecessity for contributions on the part of the State, the inclusion of\r\nthe agricultural and forest labourers, and of domestic servants of all\r\nkinds, in the schemes of insurance against illness and the insurance of\r\nmotherhood, the possibility of a voluntary insurance of all women, what\r\ncould be effected by the insurance of motherhood (free provision of\r\nmidwives and medical assistance, free lodging in case of need, the\r\nprovision of premiums for mothers suckling their own children, the\r\ninstitution of places where advice could be given to mothers, of homes\r\nfor women during pregnancy and child-birth, and homes for women and\r\ninfants), and the further development of factory legislation with regard\r\nto nursing mothers. The committee for 1907 was chosen: it consisted of\r\nHelene Stöcker, Maria Lischnewska, Adele Schreiber, Wilhelm Brandt, Iwan\r\nBloch, Max Marcuse, Heinrich Finkelstein.\r\n\r\nIn the end of January, 1907, an Austrian Association for the Protection\r\nof Mothers was founded in Vienna, under the presidency of Dr. Hugo\r\nKlein. To the committee of this Society there belong, Siegmund Freud,\r\nRosa Mayreder, Marie Eugenie delle Grazie, Professor Schauta, and about\r\nforty other well-known persons, physicians, lawyers, schoolmasters, and\r\nmany women. In the meeting at which the Association was founded, Dr.\r\nOfner spoke regarding the legal rights of illegitimate mothers and\r\nchildren, and Dr. Friedjung regarding the protection of nursing infants.\r\n\r\nIn the United States also an Association for sexual reform has been\r\nfounded, the so-called “Umwertungsgesellschaft” (Revaluation Society),\r\nthe principal aim of which is the complete re-estimation of all values\r\nin the amatory life, and the introduction of a more ideal view of love.\r\nThe President of this American Association is Emil F. Ruedebusch; the\r\nsecretary, Mrs. Lina Janssen; the meeting-place of the society is\r\nMayville, in the State of Wisconsin. Regular evenings of discussion are\r\nfixed, on which questions of especial interest are debated.\r\n\r\n[In Holland also an Association for the Protection of Mothers has been\r\nfounded; its name is “Vereeniging Onderlinge Vrouwenbescherming.”]\r\n\r\nIn the newspaper _Mutterschutz_ (1905, No. 9, pp. 375, 376), we find a\r\nreport of the meeting of the American Association held on October 8,\r\n1905, when the topic of discussion was:\r\n\r\n=What is the true nature of marriage?=\r\n\r\nThe answer ran as follows:\r\n\r\n  Is it the family (parental) relationship?--No; for a married couple\r\n  may have no children, may not desire to have children, and can, none\r\n  the less, be thoroughly married.\r\n\r\n  Is it the common home, domestic life?--No; for husband and wife may\r\n  live their whole life in a hotel, and, none the less, be thoroughly\r\n  married.\r\n\r\n  Is it the lifelong community of material interests?--No; for man and\r\n  wife can keep their property separate, if they wish to do so.\r\n\r\n  Is it mutual assistance and a state of comradeship throughout\r\n  life?--No. When a conjugal union is the exact opposite to this, we\r\n  speak of a bad husband and a bad wife; they are, none the less, man\r\n  and wife.\r\n\r\n  Does it signify a contract for a lifelong exclusive love?--Certainly\r\n  not; if marriage signified that, all Christians would be opposed to\r\n  this institution. And yet these are the things which, according to the\r\n  common estimation, make up the nature of marriage, whenever the\r\n  question is discussed in a manner which is regarded as “respectable”\r\n  and “decent.”--As a matter of fact, there is nothing respectable or\r\n  decent in this mystification.\r\n\r\n  What is it, then, in which the true nature of marriage is to be\r\n  found?--It is the possession of a human being for lifelong exclusive\r\n  sexual service.\r\n\r\n  Very various views have prevailed on the question how many human\r\n  beings it is legitimate for one human being to employ for his\r\n  exclusive sexual gratification, and among different nations, and at\r\n  various times, the most widely divergent rules and regulations have\r\n  prevailed regarding the mode of sexual possession, and, on the other\r\n  hand, regarding the duties towards this sexual property; but wherever\r\n  marriage has existed, it has signified a right of property in respect\r\n  of sexual utilization.\r\n\r\n  If we oppose marriage, =we mean that we oppose that which actually\r\n  constitutes marriage according to morality, and according to written\r\n  law, that which even the most enthusiastic advocates of this\r\n  institution regard as so debasing that they are ashamed to name it\r\n  openly=.\r\n\r\n  But, with the exception of the matters relating to sexual service, =we\r\n  hold fast to and defend everything which is publicly considered as\r\n  marriage=, and we expect that in this case we shall be “=faithful=,”\r\n  “=constant=,” and “=trustworthy=” in all circumstances. For, according\r\n  to our view, these most important imponderabilia, and these intimate\r\n  associations of interest between husband and wife, are not the\r\n  inevitable result of the longing for physical enjoyment in common, but\r\n  are the much-to-be-desired result of a well-considered longing for any\r\n  one or all of the relations entering into the question. According to\r\n  our view, however, the duration of this union, and constancy while it\r\n  lasted, would not be dependent upon the activity of sexual desires.\r\n\r\nA special =Association for Sexual Reform= was founded in Berlin in the\r\nyear 1906, at the instance of the editor of the _Die Schönheit_, Karl\r\nVanselow. It is an Association of cultured men and women who also have\r\nin view the formation of local groups, and the delivery of artistic and\r\nscientific lectures in furtherance of their movement for reform.\r\n\r\nIn the above-mentioned monthly magazine, _Mutterschutz_, edited by\r\nHelene Stöcker, all the modern problems of love, marriage, friendship,\r\nparentage, prostitution, and all the associated problems of morality,\r\nand of the entire sexual life, are discussed from their philosophical,\r\nhistorical, legal, medical, social, and ethical aspects.\r\n\r\nThe editor herself, a talented disciple of Nietzsche, has since the year\r\n1893 been chiefly occupied in the study of the psychological and ethical\r\naspects of the problems of higher love, and has recently published her\r\ncollected writings on this subject in a single volume.[207]\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting literary physiognomy which is offered to us in this\r\nbook; we encounter here a lofty, free, and pure conception of the love\r\nof the future. After the first spiritual wanderings and confusions,\r\nwhich no one in emotional pursuit of the ideal can escape, we see this\r\ncourageous and undismayed advocate of the eternal, inalienable rights of\r\nlove, ultimately insisting on the recognition of the lofty mission of\r\nlove, in accordance with the saying of Nietzsche, which she lovingly\r\nquotes: “Ye shall not propagate onwards, but upwards!” (“Nicht fort\r\nsollt Ihr Euch pflanzen, sondern hinauf!”). She especially insists on\r\nthe =duty= and =responsibility= of individual love. No one can take a\r\nmore earnest view of love than is taken here. Helene Stöcker is\r\nthroughout no radical revolutionist, but an evolutionist and reformer.\r\nShe sees quite clearly that to-day there is no panacea, no unfailing\r\nsolution of sexual problems. While she energetically contests the old\r\nsexual morality, and demands its replacement by a new freer conception\r\nof sexual relationships, she, none the less, recognizes throughout the\r\nsignificance and the value of self-command, of relative asceticism, the\r\nwonderful influence of which, in the deepening of emotional life, she\r\nhas most rightly emphasized. Especially the soul of woman, she believes,\r\nhas by the asceticism imposed on women by conventional morality, gained\r\nin a high degree, depth, fulness, and comprehensiveness. The inward\r\ndevelopment of woman will be greatly advantaged by the newer valuation\r\nof love. This will be characterized, neither by an arid renunciation and\r\ndenial of life, nor by a coarse, egoistic search for pleasure, but by a\r\njoyful affirmation of life and all its healthy powers and impulses.\r\n\r\nWhilst Helene Stocker has laid especial stress upon the psychological\r\nand ethical relationships of free love, its equal importance from\r\neconomical and social points of view has been discussed by Friedrich\r\nNaumann,[208] W. Borgius,[209] Lily Braun,[210] Maria Lischnewska,[211]\r\nand Henriette Fürth.[212]\r\n\r\nNaumann rightly draws attention to the fact that our purely monetary\r\neconomic system is favourable to the production of sterility, for the\r\nreason that in this system motherhood is equivalent to loss of money,\r\nbecause the wife ceases to earn money in a degree proportionate to the\r\nextent to which she becomes a mother. The burden of the upbringing of\r\nchildren must be made an affair of the community. At the present time,\r\non the contrary, the producer of human beings is burdened upon all\r\nsides. He who has children has more rent to pay, and increased school\r\nexpenses. Therefore, Naumann demands, as a first step to the recognition\r\nof the fact that it is a public duty to educate children, that school\r\nexpenses shall no longer be demanded from the individual parent. Above\r\nall, however, it must be made easier to the wife to be a mother.\r\n\r\nThe wife as a personality demands her right to work, and her right to\r\nmotherhood. The fact of the compulsory celibacy of an ever-increasing\r\nnumber of women competent to become mothers is the problem which here\r\ndemands solution. According to the census of 1900, there were in Germany\r\nno less than 4,210,955 women between the ages of eighteen and forty\r\nyears unmarried, the total number of women of corresponding age being\r\n9,568,659--that is, 44 per cent. were unmarried. Among these there were\r\n2,830,538 between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five years, the period\r\nmost suitable to child-bearing, the total number of women of\r\ncorresponding age being 3,593,644--that is, no less than 78 per cent.\r\nAccording to Lily Braun, there remain from 2,000,000 to 2,500,000 German\r\nwomen permanently unmarried; and we may expect the number of female\r\ncelibates to increase. The economic conditions, the previously described\r\nunhealthy conditions of coercive marriage, and the efforts of women for\r\nemancipation, have a combined influence hostile to marriage. On the\r\nother hand, law and conventional morality co-operate in making life a\r\nmartyrdom for the unmarried mother and for the illegitimate child.[213]\r\n\r\nThe woman who becomes a mother, when united only in the bonds of free\r\nlove, is at the present day defamed, despised, a being without rights.\r\nThe question of “=maintenance=” is a scandal of our time! It is the\r\nproof of the degree to which most men are devoid of conscience. An\r\nexperienced lawyer has very forcibly described the intolerable\r\nconditions which at present obtain in this matter.[214] He published the\r\nfollowing characteristic letter from a young master-butcher, which shows\r\nhow meanly even a simple-minded man may endeavour to escape the duty of\r\nmaintenance. The letter runs:\r\n\r\n  “DEAR DORA,\r\n\r\n  “I wanted to come round to-day, and wished to deal with the matter by\r\n  word of mouth, but I can’t do it, and so I must write to tell you that\r\n  we cannot marry, for, in fact, I have now less money even than when I\r\n  was a journeyman. The few hundred marks that I had I have put into the\r\n  business; and, in fact, I really cannot marry; if I did, I couldn’t\r\n  exist at all. I should have to shut up the shop. What should we do\r\n  then? I shouldn’t be able to show my face in H---- again; besides, at\r\n  best, the business is not worth very much. So, my dear Dora, write to\r\n  me now how we can settle matters; you mustn’t draw the string too\r\n  tight, or ask too much; if you do, you see, you will have to find your\r\n  own way out of the trouble. Of course, I shall be glad enough to do\r\n  what’s right, because I am as much to blame as you are. If after a\r\n  while I get on as well as my brothers have done, I can do more for\r\n  you. =But just now I can’t help you much.= Let’s hope you may find\r\n  some other man with whom you may live more happily than you have lived\r\n  with me. Dear Dora, don’t make such a fuss about it: there are plenty\r\n  more in the same case, up and down the world; you are not the only\r\n  one. Now, write to me directly what you want to do; let’s get the\r\n  matter settled quietly; that’ll be better for you. Your mother won’t\r\n  leave you in the lurch, and you will find it will all come right.\r\n\r\n  “Best love.\r\n\r\n  “FRITZ H.\r\n\r\n  “P.S.--Write soon.”\r\n\r\nLet us imagine the state of mind of the young woman who receives this\r\nletter, characterized as it is by such crafty heartlessness! And yet\r\nthis heartlessness is no greater than that of modern European society,\r\nwhich =simultaneously= makes fun of the “old maid” and condemns the\r\nunmarried mother to infamy. This double-faced, putrescent “morality” is\r\nprofoundly =immoral=, it is =radically evil=. It is moral and good to\r\ncontest it with all our energy, to enter the lists on behalf of the\r\nright to free love, to “unmarried” motherhood. Let us make a clearance\r\nof this medieval bugbear of coercive marriage morality, which is a\r\ndisgrace in respect of our state of civilization and economical\r\ndevelopment. Two million women in a condition of =compulsory= celibacy\r\nand--coercive marriage morality. It is merely necessary to place these\r\ntwo facts side by side, in order to display before our eyes the complete\r\nethical bankruptcy of our time in the province of sexual morality.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this necessity for a radical alteration in sexual\r\nmorality, we must, in the second place, enunciate the demand for a\r\ngeneral =insurance of motherhood=, for =the foundation of homes for\r\npregnant women, for women in child-birth, and for infants=. The\r\nfulfilment of these demands alone will bring us a great step forward in\r\nthe restoration to health of our sexual life, and in the preparation of\r\na more beautiful future.[215]\r\n\r\nIf it be true, as W. B. Stevenson reports,[216] that King Charles IV.\r\ndecreed that all foundling children in Spanish America were to be\r\nregarded as of noble birth, in order that all professions might be open\r\nto them, we cannot but consider that this mode of thought and action, on\r\nthe part of a ruler in the country of the Inquisition, was a shining\r\nexample for our own time.\r\n\r\n  “Society,” says Eduard Reich, “as well as the Church, =sins against\r\n  the laws of morality, as long as= it stands in the way of the\r\n  advancement of illegitimate children, either by the maintenance of\r\n  miserable prejudices against these poor beings, or by positive\r\n  decrees. We shall never be able, even should the human race enter\r\n  Paradise, to make it impossible for extra-conjugal procreation to\r\n  occur: love-children will always exist. Since, then, it is not the\r\n  fault of the latter that their parents have brought them into the\r\n  world; and, further, since, even if =all= men were married, one could\r\n  not impute it to a man as a moral transgression, if he, in the\r\n  plenitude of his procreative powers, had intercourse with a beautiful\r\n  girl, instead of with his wife (suffering, for example, from cancer,\r\n  or some other serious disease); and since, on the other hand, a wife\r\n  still in the full bloom of youth could not be blamed for\r\n  unfaithfulness if, her elderly husband having been impotent for\r\n  several years, she now has intercourse with a vigorous and healthy\r\n  young man--for such reasons, let us throw the veil of forgetfulness\r\n  over all well-intentioned human weaknesses, and no longer ask whether\r\n  a citizen of the world has been engendered in the marriage-bed, or has\r\n  sprung from the well-spring of love. To the reasonable being it is the\r\n  man himself who is of value; and only blockheads, simpletons, and\r\n  donkeys will inquire as to his origin.”[217]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd yet one more question I will address in conclusion to the adherents\r\nof coercive marriage morality. =How many= free-love relationships, how\r\nmany illegitimate children have there not been at all times among the\r\ncultured classes, even among the pillars of the throne and the altar,\r\n=precisely among those= who, on account of their higher spiritual\r\ndevelopment, ought to possess a stronger ethical sensibility (_nota\r\nbene_, from the standpoint of coercive marriage morality). It would be\r\nan interesting task to collect =statistics relating to such free unions,\r\nand the resulting= “illegitimate” offspring, in the case of notable men\r\nand women! The marriage fanatics would be horrified! Quite apart from\r\nthe =innumerable secret relationships= of this nature, and their\r\nconsequences, a short observation and enumeration of the illegitimate\r\nloves and parentage of men and women of high standing, alike spiritual\r\nand moral, would alone suffice to illuminate the actual conditions, and\r\nwould enable us to draw remarkable conclusions regarding coercive\r\nmarriage. It is my intention, as soon as possible, to represent in a\r\nbrief work the rôle of free love in the history of civilization, and to\r\nadduce proofs that free love is very well compatible with a moral life.\r\nWho would venture to reproach with immorality a Bürger, a Jean Paul, a\r\nGutzkow, a Karoline Schlegel, a George Sand, or even a Goethe?[218]\r\n\r\nIt is a simple evolutionary necessity that free love, in association\r\nwith progressive differentiation and with the reshaping of economic\r\nconditions, will find its moral justification also for those who at\r\npresent judge and condemn it from the point of view of long outworn\r\nsocial conditions.\r\n\r\n  [186] M. Nordau, “The Conventional Lies of Our Civilization.” See also\r\n  P. Näcke, “Einiges zur Frauenfrage und zur sexuellen Abstinenz”--“A\r\n  Contribution to the Woman’s Question and to the Question of Sexual\r\n  Abstinence.” Näcke condemns this duplex morality, and demands for the\r\n  woman in principle the same sexual freedom that is granted to the man.\r\n\r\n  [187] One of the most remarkable instances of free love as a popular\r\n  institution was the “island custom” of the (so-called) Isle of\r\n  Portland. Here, until well on into the nineteenth century,\r\n  experimental cohabitation was universal, and marriage did not take\r\n  place until the woman became pregnant. But if, as a result of this\r\n  experimental cohabitation, “the woman does not prove with child, after\r\n  a competent time of courtship, they conclude they are not destined by\r\n  Providence for each other; they therefore separate; and =as it is an\r\n  established maxim=, which the Portland women observe with great\r\n  strictness, =never to admit a plurality of lovers at one time=, their\r\n  honour is in no way tarnished. She just as soon gets another suitor\r\n  (after the affair is declared to be broken off) as if she had been\r\n  left a widow, or that nothing had ever happened, but that she had\r\n  remained an immaculate virgin” (Hutchins, “History and Antiquities of\r\n  the County of Dorset,” vol. ii., p. 820, 1868). So faithfully was this\r\n  “island custom” observed that, on the one hand, during a long period\r\n  no single bastard was born on the “island,” and, on the other, every\r\n  marriage was fertile. But when, for the further development of the\r\n  Portland stone trade, workmen from London, with the “wild love” habits\r\n  of the large town, came to reside in Portland, these men took\r\n  advantage of the “island custom,” and then refused to marry the girls\r\n  with whom they had cohabited. Thus, in consequence of freer\r\n  intercourse with the “civilized” world, the “Portland custom” has\r\n  gradually fallen into desuetude. But the words I have emphasized in\r\n  the quotation show how faithfully the conditions of “free love,” as\r\n  defined in this work, were observed in Portland. An account of\r\n  Portland, with allusions to the local practice of “free love,” will be\r\n  found in Thomas Hardy’s novel, “The Well Beloved.”--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n  [188] A.

But with corresponding\r\nemphasis I must condemn, from the standpoint of the physician and from\r\nthat of public hygiene, and also on ethical grounds, the now so widely\r\ndiffused “extra-conjugal” sexual intercourse, for which, in order to\r\ndistinguish it from the entirely different extra-conjugal “free” love, I\r\nsuggest the term “=wild love=.”\r\n\r\nThis wild love is the true cancer of our society, for its chief\r\ncharacteristic is that it constitutes =an enduring connexion and means\r\nof transition= between hygienically and ethically unexceptionable sexual\r\nintercourse and prostitution, and thus involves the unceasing risk of\r\ntransferring to the former =all the dangers= of the latter. In this\r\nsense, wild love can really be regarded as a kind of =irradiation= of\r\nthe whole nature of prostitution into the entirety of sexual relations\r\nin general. Thus, it remains a powerful hindrance to all ennoblement and\r\nresanation of the amatory life, and it is an invincible source of the\r\nmoral and physical degeneration and the infective contamination of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nWild love is intimately connected with the artificial sensual life of\r\nour time, and with the manifold varieties of seduction[219] arising from\r\nthat life. Wild love, the sensual life, and seduction, form, as it were,\r\na triad, each member of which is the principal predisposing condition of\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\nHe who wishes to characterize in a few words the European civilization\r\nof the present day may say that its nature consists in =epicureanism=,\r\nmitigated by =toil= and the =struggle for life=; but this epicureanism\r\nis of a very peculiar kind. It is no longer the unqualified sensual life\r\nof the eighteenth century, in which sensual lusts and epicurean\r\nrefinements were to many the whole object of life, nor is it the\r\ncomfortable enjoyment of “the good old times”; it is a quite peculiar\r\n=concentrated= enjoyment of the moment, =in the midst of the hard work\r\nof life=. The _carpe diem_ of Horace has to-day become _carpe horam_!\r\n\r\nThe forced labour which the fierce struggle for existence at present\r\nentails upon the majority of men leaves no more time for a simple\r\nundisturbed enjoyment of existence, for the inward deep =experience= of\r\nreality, and for a quiet joy therein. No, our sensual life of to-day\r\nbears in it the sting of =pain=, because the will to live, which,\r\naccording to Schopenhauer, continually strives for an “=increase of\r\nlife=,” has now degenerated into a convulsive search for =the most\r\nviolent sensations possible=, into a wild hunt after the strongest\r\npossible and most frequent enjoyments, because the time is lacking for a\r\npeaceful, harmonious existence. Each man asks himself anxiously whether\r\nhe may not have “missed” this or that possibility of objective pleasure;\r\nand forgets in doing so that the true happiness of life lies =within\r\nhimself=, and that the greatest possible sum of outward enjoyments\r\ncannot procure him this happiness.\r\n\r\nThe signature of our time is “=amuse oneself=,” a phrase which conveys\r\nthe idea of all our modern superficial pleasures, and of our sensual and\r\nspiritual sensations, which must chase one another in rapid succession\r\nin order to enable the modern civilized man to feel that he “lives.”\r\n\r\nFor the majority of those living in great towns, amusement is equivalent\r\nto a =continued succession of superficial sensual pleasures, as\r\npreparatory stimuli for an equally fugitive and debasing sexual act=.\r\n\r\nThe frequently heard and favourite phrases “to go through with it,” “to\r\nlive one’s life,” “to sow one’s wild oats,” etc., have all the same\r\nsignificance, in the sense of preparation for sexual indulgence by means\r\nof such stimuli.\r\n\r\nFrom beer-saloons and public-houses of all kinds, especially those at\r\nwhich the attendants are women, from the cabarets and variety theatres,\r\nthe low-class music-halls and dancing-saloons, also, however, from\r\nbetter-class balls, soirées, and luxurious dinners, the road is open to\r\nthe prostitute, or to the arms of a girl excited by similar sensual\r\nstimuli to a similarly transitory sexual desire.\r\n\r\nA great physician has said: “We eat three times too much.” I might add,\r\nin amplification of this saying, Not only do we eat three times too\r\nmuch, but we look for all other sensual pleasures in excess, and for\r\nthis reason =we love also three times too much=, or rather, we indulge\r\n=too often= in sexual intercourse.\r\n\r\nOne of our most talented psychologists, Willy Hellpach, has described\r\nthese relationships with great insight:\r\n\r\n  “To the enormous majority of our young men sexual indulgence is a\r\n  matter of course, like their card-parties, their evenings at the club,\r\n  their glass of beer; and of the few who live otherwise, a considerable\r\n  proportion do so simply from timidity, or from poverty of spirit (they\r\n  would like to, but they cannot screw their courage up). Another\r\n  portion is honourably continent, but does not dare to make any display\r\n  of this adhesion to principle, and rather pretends not to be\r\n  distinguished in any way from the majority; and the very few young men\r\n  who openly set their faces against the custom may be counted on the\r\n  fingers of one hand. It is obvious that in this way the extra-conjugal\r\n  sexual act loses the distinction of the unaccustomed; it is effected\r\n  continually in a more heedless, light-hearted, frivolous\r\n  manner--until, finally, the very idea of danger connected with\r\n  indiscriminate sexual indulgence is forgotten; the preventive is\r\n  thrown aside with an easy “Nothing has ever happened to me.” Indeed,\r\n  many a man goes to his fate in the shape of infection with his eyes\r\n  open, and with the most light-hearted confidence: if he is infected,\r\n  there will be plenty of time before his marriage to be thoroughly\r\n  cured.\r\n\r\n  “This factor comes the more readily into play in proportion to the\r\n  degree in which the whole arrangement of the sensual life culminates\r\n  in the stimulation of erotic activities. Such a tendency is inevitably\r\n  associated with the development of the modern large town; and there\r\n  ensues an imitation of the sensual life of large towns in smaller\r\n  towns, and even in country villages.[220]\r\n\r\n  “Every large town provides the means for a much more extensive\r\n  stimulation of the senses than country life; and the alternate\r\n  stimulation and deadening of the senses, characteristic of town life,\r\n  has in the very large towns of our time reached an unheard-of degree\r\n  of intensity. The town is the typical habitat of that sensual and\r\n  nervous condition of irritability which historically characterizes our\r\n  own generation; the townsman is the typical representative of\r\n  “nervousness” in its modern form. The verbal connexion between\r\n  “senses” and “sensuality” represents an actual transition; and in\r\n  ordinary parlance, by the “sensual” we understand the “erotic.” Where\r\n  the senses are more strongly stimulated, there erotic desire grows,\r\n  there it loses its periodical course in favour of a continuous\r\n  wakefulness, or, at any rate, in favour of a light slumber, which the\r\n  slightest stimulus will disturb. And the townsman is more easily\r\n  impelled to the sexual act, not merely because the town offers him\r\n  prostitutes, “intimates,” etc., in much greater numbers, but also\r\n  because his over-stimulated nervous system impels him much more\r\n  powerfully to search for these objects, and makes it much more\r\n  difficult for him to safeguard himself against their allurements.\r\n\r\n  “And town life is nocturnal life! The more so, the larger the town;\r\n  and we see the extreme form of this in the great capitals of Europe.\r\n  The consequences in regard to the opportunities for and incitations to\r\n  sexual enjoyment are not lacking. First of all, nocturnal life gives\r\n  rise to a summation of stimuli, to an incredible variety of nervous\r\n  titillation, and this induces an increasing sensuality; and once the\r\n  sensual life has become habitually nocturnal, now, by a vicious\r\n  circle, all enjoyment is unavoidably fettered to the town. Natural\r\n  recuperation has become a secondary consideration, and in place of the\r\n  relief of tension, we have apparent restoration by means of variety.\r\n  All, all, tends in favour of a sharpening of sensual stimuli, of\r\n  arousing the wish for erotic pleasures. And the town is untiring,\r\n  inexhaustible, in its discovery of means for the gratification of\r\n  these instincts. Variety theatres, gin-palaces, low music-halls, and\r\n  all the amusements of similar kind, are simply unthinkable without the\r\n  sensual note; and even where they maintain themselves to be free from\r\n  that note, it will be unconsciously sought by the audience, will be\r\n  easily found, and if it were absent, its absence would be angrily\r\n  resented. The same is true, more or less, of entertainments of a\r\n  higher æsthetic rank. With very few exceptions, our theatres are\r\n  compelled to take into consideration the instincts of the public, and\r\n  the instincts of the population of our large towns are chiefly\r\n  concerned with eroticism. Even where sexual questions are elevated\r\n  into the sphere of the highest art, and by the artist himself the\r\n  common is detested, the audience will, after their kind, merely\r\n  extract erotic stimulation; and that the opera and the stage are\r\n  sought by many merely on account of these accessory influences, is too\r\n  well known to need proof--not to say a word regarding the pantomime\r\n  and the ballet.\r\n\r\n  “Perhaps the worst of all is yet to come. In his public dinners, his\r\n  parties, his clubs, his balls, etc., the man of the upper classes, and\r\n  also the man of the middle classes, does not find the\r\n  much-to-be-desired ethical counterpoise to this characteristic sensual\r\n  life of our young men; but rather finds the prolongation of it in a\r\n  somewhat more masked and artificial form. From the outset, the\r\n  relationship between the sexes is of so suggestive, so purposive a\r\n  character, that this exercises a gentle, stimulating influence upon\r\n  desire; and a man is thrown into a state of tension for which he often\r\n  finds only one outlet, sexual gratification--which he must either buy\r\n  or obtain by cunning--and thus he passes straightway from the\r\n  influences of the public sensual life, to become the customer of the\r\n  prostitute, the partner in the “intimacy,” the seducer in the\r\n  nocturnal life of the great town. He then either runs the danger of\r\n  infection with venereal diseases, or he occupies himself with their\r\n  dissemination; for the man suffering from venereal disease is not\r\n  merely a victim: he is commonly also a focus of infection, one who\r\n  finds new victims in the shape of girls hitherto uninfected.\r\n\r\n  “To this evil a remarkable trait in the sensual life of the simpler\r\n  woman extends ready assistance--I mean that servility, that erotic\r\n  obsequiousness which finds expression already in the gossip, and in\r\n  the favourite reading of the lower classes, and which makes them feel\r\n  to some extent flattered if they are treated as means of enjoyment by\r\n  a man of good position. It is well known that the prostitute in her\r\n  talk gladly makes her lover a baron; but, unfortunately, a similar\r\n  tendency characterizes the feminine half of the lower classes\r\n  throughout, and to our regret, this is more especially true of the\r\n  German people. Our commercial-traveller nature, to which, according to\r\n  Sombart, we owe a portion of our ascendancy in the markets of the\r\n  world, finds its most regrettable and disastrous seamy side in the\r\n  readiness with which the masses forget their pride and self-respect,\r\n  when it is a question of snatching a pleasure. This characteristic\r\n  has, in recent lustra, unfortunately become not better, but rather\r\n  worse; the desire to look well at any cost, with which the simple girl\r\n  so often makes herself laughable, inspires also her longing to ‘walk\r\n  out’ with a distinguished admirer.”[221]\r\n\r\nBut not only does the simple girl of the people sacrifice her life and\r\nhealth in this pursuit of pleasure; the young men also are not\r\nbehindhand in the pursuit, which they regard as “gentlemanlike,” of\r\nenjoyment and of women. It is astonishing what an increase in recent\r\ntimes there has been in the number of youthful embezzlers, learners and\r\nclerks in merchants’ offices, whose offences have been committed simply\r\nin order to provide funds for the gratification of their pothouse\r\npleasures. Among them one meets lads between the ages of fourteen and\r\neighteen years, a symptom of the earlier sexual maturity of the present\r\nday. When, as usually happens, they are arrested after a few days, it\r\ncomes out in evidence that the embezzled money was squandered in the\r\nsociety of prostitutes, but we learn that the tendency to such excess\r\nhad existed in the embezzler long before he actually committed a crime.\r\nIf the heads of businesses were to keep themselves better informed\r\nregarding the mode of life of their employees, many a disillusion and\r\nmany a loss would be spared them.\r\n\r\nSexual seduction is at the present time effected less by individuals\r\nthan by the environment. =The sensual life as such=, the entire\r\nstimulating sensual atmosphere of that life, plays to-day a rôle which\r\nat an earlier time, when our social life and pleasures were less fully\r\ndeveloped, fell to the “seducer,” the _galant homme_ and Don Juan of\r\nearlier days. Our young people are subjected rather to the general\r\ninfluences of the pursuit of amusement, which fascinates all circles,\r\nthan to the allurements of the habitual seducer. =To-day, the victims\r\nof public seduction, by means of the sensual life characteristic of our\r\ntime, are far more numerous= than those seduced by isolated individuals,\r\nthough such there have been, and will be, at all times.\r\n\r\nBefore I pass to the consideration of the individual influences of the\r\nmodern sensual life, those by which wild love is especially favoured,\r\nand before I describe the general seduction of the present day, I\r\npropose to touch upon the interesting question of “=professional\r\nseduction=,” to consider Don-Juanism and the practice of the “_ars\r\namandi_.”\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable how strongly the history of the art of seduction\r\nreflects the general tendency of the evolution of love from purely\r\nphysical impulses to spiritual love. This we learn simply from the study\r\nof the numerous =text-books of the art of love=, the so-called “_ars\r\namandi_.”\r\n\r\nWhereas in the earlier text-books of this subject, from Ovid’s “Ars\r\nAmandi,”[222] widely celebrated in antiquity, to the “Practica Artis\r\nAmandi,”[223] the “Morale Galante, ou l’Art de Bien Aimer,”[224] of the\r\nseventeenth century, and Gentil Bernard’s “L’Art d’Aimer,”[225] of the\r\neighteenth century, the principal stress was laid upon all the possible\r\nsensual stimuli, and upon the superficial gallantry associated with\r\nthis; in the modern text-books, in that of Manso[226] (still belonging\r\nto the eighteenth century), but especially in the more recent works by\r\nStendhal,[227] Paul Bourget,[228] A. Silvestre,[229] Catulle\r\nMendés,[230] Robert Hessen,[231] and Hjalmar Kjölenson,[232] we find\r\nmuch more stress laid on all the =spiritual= influences of the art of\r\nlove. In this way it is possible to follow in these works the whole\r\ncourse of the enrichment of the spiritual and emotional life in\r\nlove.[233]\r\n\r\nThe same process of development can be recognized also in the figure of\r\nDon Juan. His type has undergone gradual alteration, always becoming\r\nmore and more intellectual. The =purely sensual= Don Juan, as Lord\r\nChesterfield, for example, characterizes and embodies him, is to-day\r\nquite out of date even among sensual men of the ordinary type; whereas\r\nthough Kierkegaard’s “Diary of a Seducer” describes an extreme type,\r\nthat of the purely reflective libertine, yet in this extreme, the author\r\nhas very rightly recognized the general tendency of evolution.\r\n\r\nRecently, Oscar A. H. Schmitz has published an extremely original and\r\nthoughtful study of “Don Juan, Casanova, and other Erotic Characters”\r\n(Stuttgart, 1906), in which he distinguishes very sharply the seducer\r\ntype of a Casanova from the seducer-type of a Don Juan. Don Juan is a\r\ndeceitful, cunning seducer, to whom the =sense of possession= associated\r\nwith the attainment of his aim, the =danger=, the activity of his\r\n=desires for power and dominance=, are the principal matters, but who is\r\nin himself =unerotic=; whereas Casanova is pre-eminently the erotic,\r\nalso crafty and deceitful, not, however, for the gratification of his\r\nneed for power, but rather for the agreeable satisfaction of his need\r\nfor sensual love. Don Juan knows only “women”; for Casanova each one is\r\n“the woman.” Don Juan is demoniacal, devilish he goes on to the complete\r\ndestruction of the women seduced by him, deliberately he ensures their\r\nunhappiness; Casanova is human, cares always for the happiness of the\r\nwomen he loves, and devotes to them a tender reflection. Don Juan\r\n=despises= women, he is of the type of the misogynist, of the satanic\r\nwoman-hater; Casanova is the typical feminist, he possesses a profound\r\nunderstanding of woman’s soul, is not disappointed by love, and needs\r\nfor his life’s happiness continuous contact with feminine natures. Don\r\nJuan seduces by means of his own elemental nature, by the attractive\r\npower of brutal wild force; Casanova does so by means of the sensual\r\natmosphere which surrounds him.\r\n\r\nWith an accurate psychological insight, Schmitz remarks:\r\n\r\n  “It seems as if the love of one, or, where possible, of several, women\r\n  inoculates the man, as it were, with a vital fluid, and gives his\r\n  glance a fire which at times makes him irresistible. Men of pleasure\r\n  declare that after the most fortunate nights, when, exhausted, they\r\n  were returning home to sleep, on the way the most eager and meaning\r\n  glances were cast upon them by the women whom they passed.”\r\n\r\nThis distinction between the two types of seducer, which Schmitz makes\r\nin his original book, containing excellent observations on the\r\npsychology of love, is indeed not new. Stendhal, in the chapter\r\n“Werther and Don Juan” of his book, “Ueber die Liebe,” pp. 241-251\r\n(German edition, Leipzig, 1903), points out the same types. “The genuine\r\nDon Juans,” he says, “ultimately come to regard women as their enemies,\r\nand find actual pleasure in their manifold unhappiness”; whereas\r\nWerther, the equivalent of Casanova, regards all women as entrancing\r\nbeings, towards whom we are far too unjust. The love of Don Juan is “a\r\nsimilar feeling to the love of the chase”; Werther’s love is gentle,\r\nidealizes the reality, is full of tender and romantic impressions. Don\r\nJuan is the conqueror; Werther is the erotic.\r\n\r\nI myself also, in my work on “Sexual Life in England,” vol. ii., p. 159\r\n(Berlin, 1903), have, earlier than Schmitz, clearly distinguished from\r\none another these two seducer types, in a passage in which I depict the\r\nBritish Don Juan, in contrast to the French and Italian Don Juan.\r\n\r\nThe passage runs:\r\n\r\n  “The principal characteristic of the British Don Juans, who are\r\n  completely distinct from the libertines of the Latin and of the other\r\n  Teutonic countries, is the =cold, brazen= quietude with which they\r\n  indulge in the sensual pleasures of life; =love is much less to them\r\n  an affair of passion than one of pride and of the gratification of\r\n  their consciousness of power=. The French, the Italian Don Juan is\r\n  driven by ardent sensuality from conquest to conquest. This is the\r\n  =principal motive= of their actions and of their mode of life. The\r\n  English Don Juan seduces on principle, for the sake of experiment; he\r\n  pursues love as a sport. Sensuality plays a part only in the second\r\n  degree, and in the midst of his sensual enjoyment the coldness of his\r\n  heart is still painfully apparent.\r\n\r\n  “This is the =rake=, the type of =Lovelace=, which Richardson, in his\r\n  ‘Clarissa Harlowe,’ has described with incomparable mastery.”\r\n\r\nTaine, also, in his “History of English Literature,” has described this\r\nBritish Don-Juanism, which hates rather than loves.\r\n\r\nFinally, we find these types also in Rosa Mayreder’s book, “Zur Kritik\r\nder Weiblicheit” (“Critique of Femininity,” Leipzig, 1905), especially\r\nin the chapter, “A Few Words on the Powerful Faust” (pp. 210-243). Her\r\ntype of the “=masterful erotic=” closely resembles the Don Juan type of\r\nSchmitz, and my own British seducer type.\r\n\r\n  “Erotic excitement,” says Rosa Mayreder, “gives rise in these men to\r\n  the lust of dominion; to them the relationship with women signifies a\r\n  grasping possession, an enjoyment of power, and they are unable to\r\n  think of women except as subject and dependent. Only in so far as\r\n  woman adapts herself to them as a means do they know her; as a\r\n  personality, with individual aims, she does not exist for them.”\r\n\r\nThis masterful eroticism exists among men of quite low social position,\r\njust as much as among men of high position.[234] Their diametrical\r\nopposite is the love-perception of delicately sensitive, erotical,\r\nhighly differentiated men, whose highest type constitutes the “=erotic\r\ngenius=.” Rosa Mayreder characterizes this latter type in the following\r\nterms:\r\n\r\n  “The increasing differentiation of erotic perception brings with it a\r\n  new faculty, which extinguishes the consciousness of superiority and\r\n  transforms the need for contrast into the need for community, for\r\n  reciprocity--the capacity for devotion. Thus comes to pass the most\r\n  remarkable phenomenon in the masculine psyche, the great miracle,\r\n  which effects a complete transformation of the primitive mode of\r\n  perception, a transformation of the teleological sexual nature.\r\n\r\n  “The erotic genius grasps the nature of the opposite sex with\r\n  intuitive understanding, and is capable of assimilating it completely.\r\n  The other sex is to him the primevally akin and primevally allied; his\r\n  love-relationships are accompanied by ideas of enlargement,\r\n  fulfilment, liberation of his own essential nature, or even by the\r\n  idea of a mystical union. To him sexuality does not denote an\r\n  annulment or limitation of personality, but rather an enlargement and\r\n  enrichment by means of the individuals with which, in this way, his\r\n  personality is associated.”\r\n\r\nAs an erotic genius of such a kind, Rosa Mayreder points to Richard\r\nWagner, as he manifests himself in his letters to Mathilde Wesendonk.\r\n\r\nThe sensibility and refinement of the modern woman, her emergence as a\r\npersonality, must continually repel the masterful type of\r\nerotic--although doubtless that type will never be entirely eliminated.\r\nI do not believe in a complete transformation of the teleological sexual\r\nnature of man, which has always assigned to him the active aggressive\r\nrôle. But it is true that the possibilities of existence for the\r\nmasterful erotic, the Don Juan type, have become limited. He must, as\r\nSchmitz rightly insists, intellectualize himself if he wishes to\r\ncontinue to exist. This psychological satanism of the modern Don Juan is\r\nwonderfully described by Kierkegaard, in his “Diary of a Seducer.”[235]\r\n\r\nThe hero of this book learns best from the girls themselves how they can\r\nbe betrayed; he develops in them “spiritual eroticism,” in order then\r\nsuddenly to abandon them, but =they themselves= must loosen the tie.\r\nWoman and love are not to him in themselves the principal need; what is\r\nimportant to him is, as he says at the conclusion, that he has been\r\nable to enrich himself with numerous erotic perceptions. The modern Don\r\nJuan is, therefore, nothing more than a =cold psychological\r\nexperimenter=. It is in this way that, with prophetic insight, Choderlos\r\nde Laclos has described him in the Vicomte de Valmont, the hero of his\r\n“Liaisons Dangereuses.”\r\n\r\nYet another interesting Don Juan type of our time has to be considered,\r\none which indeed is not a genuine Don Juan, but a =pseudo= Don Juan, or\r\nrather a pseudo Casanova; and this type makes its appearance also in the\r\nfemale sex.\r\n\r\nLike Rétif de la Bretonne, it is the man or woman seeking eternally for\r\nthe ideal, for true love; a type which only, in consequence of the\r\never-repeated disillusions and errors, assumes a Don Juanesque\r\ncharacter. At the present day, we meet this type very often. It is only\r\nthe expression of the increasing difficulty of the proper love choice,\r\nowing to the progressive differentiation of our time; and it is not\r\noriginated by the desire for sensual lust, but rather by the eternally\r\ndisillusioned yearning for genuine individual love.\r\n\r\nBut we must return after this excursion to the consideration of the\r\ncommonest type of public seduction by means of the sensual life of our\r\ntime. It is significant that this also possesses its literary guides and\r\ncourse of instruction, in the form of the numerous printed =handbooks\r\nfor the world of pleasure=. Among these we may mention, “Guides du\r\nViveur,” “Guides de Plaisir,” “Führer durch das Nächtliche Berlin”\r\n(“Guide to Berlin by Night”), “New London Guide to the Night Houses,”\r\n“Die Geheimnisse der Berliner Passage” (“Secrets of the ‘Passage’ of\r\nBerlin”), “Paris by Night,” “The Swell’s Night Guide through the\r\nMetropolis,” “Bruxelles la Nuit, Physiologie des Établissements\r\nNocturnes de Bruxelles” (for Englishmen of pleasure, published under the\r\ntitle of “Brussels by Gas-light”), “Paris and Brussels after Dark,” “The\r\nGentleman’s Night Guide,” “Hamburgs galante Häuser bei Nacht und Nebel”\r\n(“Hamburg’s Fast Houses by Night and Cloud”), “Das Galante Berlin,”\r\n“Naturgeschichte der galanten Frauen in Berlin” (“Natural History of the\r\nFast Women of Berlin”), “Paris Intime et Mystérieux,” “Guide des\r\nPlaisirs Mondains et des Plaisirs Secrets à Paris.” All these have\r\nappeared during the last thirty years, some of them in several editions.\r\nFor Vienna, Buda-Pesth, St. Petersburg, Rome, Milan, Barcelona, Madrid,\r\nMarseilles, Rotterdam, and New York, there also exist such guides to all\r\nopen and secret enjoyments.\r\n\r\nIn order to give an idea of the contents of such a guide to the sensual\r\nlife, I need merely enumerate the chapter headings of a book published\r\nin 1905, and, as the Paris bookseller from whom I obtained it informed\r\nme, immediately confiscated, but =none the less= still openly sold in\r\nthe bookshops of the Boulevards and the Rue de Rivoli. It bears the\r\ntitle, “=Pour s’Amuser=. Guide du Viveur à Paris, par Victor Leca”\r\n(Paris, 1905). In his versified dedication, the compiler writes:\r\n\r\n   “Nous connaissons la Capitale,\r\n    Et nous l’aimons avec ferveur;\r\n    Ma science expérimentale\r\n    A fait ce ‘Guide du Viveur.’”\r\n\r\n  [“We know the Capital,\r\n    And we love it with fervour;\r\n    My experimental science\r\n    Has made this Guide for the Man about Town.”]\r\n\r\nAnd he states in the preface that all the various pleasures of Paris,\r\nfor the eye, the ear, and the sense of taste, lead ultimately to--woman,\r\nin complete agreement with the definition which I gave above of the\r\nsensual life of our time. All these pleasures concur in leading to\r\nsexual indulgence--that is the end, the climax of every “amusement,” the\r\ntrue _punctum saliens_ of the life of pleasure of our large towns. Thus\r\nLeca, in his comprehensive and elaborate guide for men of pleasure, lays\r\nthe principal stress on announcements regarding eroticism and on\r\nopportunities for erotic adventures in the individual places of\r\npleasure. He enumerates these in series: the theatre, especially the\r\n“théâtres très légers,” the “cafés-concerts,” the dancing-saloons, the\r\nhippodromes, and circuses, the cabarets of Montmartre, the Quartier\r\nLatin, the women’s cafés, the boulevards, the halls of the central\r\nmarket, the brothels (with an exact indication of the streets, and with\r\nthe numbers of the houses!!), the houses of accommodation (_maisons de\r\nrendezvous_), the likenesses of a few “ladies of pleasure,” the arcades,\r\nthe parks and public gardens, the popular festivals, the races,\r\ndrives, public bathing establishments, cemeteries, museums, and\r\nexhibitions--all, always, in relation to the feminine element.\r\n\r\nThese handbooks of the art of enjoyment are existing proofs, from the\r\npoint of view of the history of civilization, of the fact =that the\r\nsexual impulse is, in every possible way, influenced, increased,\r\nelaborated, and complicated, by the civilization of the present day=.\r\nEspecially the life of great towns, where the essence of modern\r\ncivilization is found in its most concentrated form, is a sexual\r\nstimulant in the highest degree, with its haste and hunting, its\r\n“nocturnal life,”[236] with its multiplicity of enjoyments for all the\r\nsenses, with its gastronomic and alcoholic excesses--in short, with its\r\nnew device that after work comes =pleasure=, and not repose.\r\n\r\nIn my “Sexual Life in England” (vol. ii., p. 261 _et seq._) I have\r\ndescribed the momentous influence of the mode of life upon sexuality,\r\nand have proved how both in the old England and in the new the excessive\r\nconsumption of meat and of alcoholic beverages has unnaturally\r\nstimulated the sexual impulse, and has conducted it into devious paths.\r\n\r\nBut of Germany also we may say that, apart from the times of “meat\r\nfamine,” we eat =too much meat= and drink =too much alcohol=, the former\r\nespecially among the higher classes, the latter among all classes of\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nThe sexually stimulating influence of luxurious feeding, which, for\r\nexample, Gabriele d’Annunzio describes in the early part of his romance\r\n“Lust,” and which Tolstoi, in the “Kreutzer Sonata,” describes as the\r\nprincipal cause of incitation to lasciviousness, is indeed a well-known\r\nfact of experience; and the =later= in the day these heavy meals are\r\nconsumed, the more dangerous are they in respect of their influence on\r\nthe sexual impulse. I am fully convinced that the good old German custom\r\nof taking the principal meal of the day at noon =is greatly preferable=\r\nto the so-called “English dinner,” when the principal meal is deferred\r\nto four or six o’clock. Luxurious suppers, or even midnight dinners,\r\nsuch as at the present day are quite customary, must be definitely\r\nregarded as aphrodisiac.\r\n\r\nA far more momentous rôle is played by =alcohol= in the modern sensual\r\nlife. A writer who is not himself a strict teetotaller may yet feel it\r\nhis duty to lay all possible stress on this fact. Indeed, from the\r\nstandpoint of medical experience and observation, I am prepared to term\r\nalcohol the =evil genius= of the modern sexual life, because in a\r\nmalicious and underhand manner it delivers its victim to sexual\r\nmisleading and corruption, to venereal infection, and to all the\r\nconsequences of casual sexual intercourse.[237]\r\n\r\nThis is not the place for a detailed discussion of the drink question,\r\nor for stating the reasons for my own opinion, that complete abstinence\r\nis a Utopian idea, and that the =moderate= and careful use of alcohol,\r\nin quantities suited to the particular individuality, and at =suitable=\r\ntimes, does no harm worth mentioning. Though this be so, I cannot fail\r\nto recognize the deeply tragic rôle which the customary abuse of alcohol\r\nplays in the sexual corruption of our time. As to the connexion between\r\nalcohol and the sexual life, I must therefore speak at greater\r\nlength.[238]\r\n\r\nThe influence of alcohol upon the sexual life and upon the psyche is a\r\nvery peculiar one. Beer or wine, taken in =very moderate= quantities,\r\nunquestionably give rise, in addition to their general psychical\r\nstimulating influence, to sexual excitement of greater or less degree.\r\nThis sexual excitement, if more alcohol is now taken, endures =longer=\r\nthan the psychical excitement, which soon gives place to psychical\r\nparalysis, to a discontinuance of the inhibitory influences proceeding\r\nfrom the brain. It is in this unequal influence exercised upon the\r\npurely sensual-sexual and upon the psychical processes, that the\r\npeculiar danger of alcoholic excesses appears to me to depend. The\r\nsexual stimulation produced by the first draught of alcohol continues at\r\na time when the man has already lost all control over reason and will,\r\nand thus he becomes an easy prey to sexual seduction.\r\n\r\nIt is only in this way that we can explain the momentous influence of\r\nalcohol, for we know, generally speaking, it is not a means for the\r\nincrease of sexual power. On the contrary, it increases voluptuousness\r\nand sexual desire, but almost always hinders erection and delays the\r\nsexual orgasm.\r\n\r\n=Thus, a man under the influence of alcohol requires a longer time for\r\nthe completion of the act of sexual intercourse than a sober man=, and\r\nin this way the danger of venereal infection is notably increased, for\r\nthe contact with the infecting person is considerably longer. I have\r\ninquired of many patients who were infected during intercourse with\r\nprostitutes after alcoholic excess, and was almost always informed that\r\nthe act of intercourse, owing to the well-known relative impotence\r\nproduced by alcohol, was exceptionally long in duration, and this\r\nnaturally gave more opportunity for excessive contact, for mechanical\r\ninjuries dependent upon increased friction, etc., and thus brought about\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\nIn medical literature, numerous cases are reported in which two men have\r\ncompleted intercourse with an infected prostitute, shortly after one\r\nanother, and, remarkable to relate, one only became infected, whilst the\r\nother remained healthy. More exact inquiry would show without doubt in\r\nmany such cases that the uninfected man was sober, in comparison with\r\nthe infected man, who must have been under the influence of alcohol.\r\n\r\nIn the case of women, with regard to whom there can be no question of\r\nany specific effect upon sexual “potency,” the influence of alcohol in\r\nexciting libido, in association with its withdrawal of all psychical\r\ninhibitions, makes itself all the more manifest. Thus, to woman, who,\r\nspeaking generally, is far more intolerant of the drug than man, very\r\nmoderate enjoyment of alcohol entails dangers.[239]\r\n\r\nThe seducer, the procuress, and the prostitute are all familiar with the\r\nabove-described peculiar influence of alcohol upon the libido sexualis\r\nand upon the psyche, and it is precisely this discriminative duplex\r\ninfluence which is utilized by them. Not only in the so-called\r\n“Animierkneipen”--that is, the drinking-saloons with women\r\nattendants--and in the brothels does alcohol subserve this purpose, but\r\nthe street-walkers also await their victims by preference outside the\r\ndoors of the great restaurants, or after festival dinners, and keep an\r\neye especially on drunken men, because in the case of these, in whom all\r\nself-command has been lost, they have, in every respect, an easy\r\nprey.[240]\r\n\r\nA man under the influence of alcohol is as easily led and as devoid of\r\nwill-power as a child. He is not particular in his choice: he generally\r\nfails to notice whether the prostitute who accosts him is young or old,\r\npretty or ugly, clean or dirty; he follows her blindly, and in most\r\ncases with results disastrous to his pocket and to his health. The\r\nfollowing case illustrates very clearly this loss of will produced in a\r\nman by indulgence in alcohol:\r\n\r\nAn officer of high rank, a married man, in general a man of solid\r\nrepute, left the officers’ casino after a banquet late at night, very\r\ntipsy, to seek his house. Suddenly he felt an arm thrust into his; it\r\nwas a prostitute who had noticed his condition, and she had turned it to\r\nher own advantage. Without reflection and without exercise of will, he\r\nallowed her to lead him to her dwelling, and there, still in a quite\r\napathetic condition, had intercourse with her, without taking any\r\nprecautions whatever. It was not until afterwards that he saw, being\r\nthen somewhat sobered, that he was in the company of an elderly\r\nprostitute of the lowest class. His dread of venereal infection was\r\njustified a few days later by the appearance of a urethral discharge. In\r\ngreat alarm he consulted me. Microscopic examination of the urethral\r\nsecretion, and the cure which ensued in a few days, showed me that he\r\nwas suffering from a simple urethral catarrh, and not from gonorrhœa.\r\n\r\nSuch cases as this, however, do not always end so fortunately. It is\r\nnotorious, and has been proved by the researches of leading physicians\r\nand medical statisticians, that the majority of venereal infections take\r\nplace under the influence of alcohol.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, =the continued increase in the consumption of alcohol\r\nleads to a further diffusion of venereal diseases=. While our ancestors\r\nconsumed alcoholic beverages to excess only on Sundays and festival\r\ndays, at the present time spirits are freely consumed on weekdays--above\r\nall, during the evenings. Brandy and beer have become everyday\r\nbeverages, especially beer, whose consumption increases year by year, so\r\nthat in the year 1898 the beer drunk in Germany was valued at\r\n£100,000,000! Strümpell showed that labourers earning three marks a day\r\nare accustomed to spend eighty pfennige--that is, more than one-third of\r\ntheir income--on beer; these are by no means notorious drinkers, but\r\nsteady fellows who only follow the general “custom.” The part played by\r\nbeer in Germany is played by absinthe in France; the well-known\r\n“apéritif” to which prostitutes of Paris so often invite their male\r\nclients is in most cases absinthe. Wine, as the experienced Fiaux says,\r\nis merely an “ideal drink” in the dreams of the ordinary Parisian\r\nprostitute.\r\n\r\nWe shall return in subsequent chapters of this work to the consideration\r\nof alcohol in its relations to the sexual life in general, and to\r\nabnormal sexual manifestations in particular. We shall also have\r\noccasion to speak of the momentous rôle played by alcohol in the\r\ncausation of offences against morality. Baer goes so far as to assert\r\nthat alcohol is the cause in 77 per cent. of such offences.\r\n\r\nHere we shall only once more insist upon the high degree to which the\r\nexcessive enjoyment of alcohol assists in seduction and favours wild\r\nlove--that is, sexual intercourse free from all choice and all\r\nregulation. This is to be seen with especial clearness at popular\r\nfestivals and other occasions giving rise to alcoholic excesses; and the\r\neffects are later shown by the resulting increase in the number of\r\nillegitimate births.\r\n\r\nMagnus Hirschfeld relates that when he was a student he spent one\r\nChristmas Eve in the company of a professor of medicine in Breslau.\r\nAmong the guests were two of the maternity assistants, and first one,\r\nthen the other, was called away to attend confinements. An old physician\r\nwho was present thereupon remarked: “Yes, yes; these are the children of\r\nthe Emperor’s birthday.” Hirschfeld, who asked for an explanation of\r\nthis incomprehensible phrase, was told that on Christmas Night the lying\r\nin hospitals were overcrowded, because then the illegitimate children\r\nwere born which had been procreated nine months earlier, on March 22,\r\nthe birthday of the old Emperor, celebrated as a popular holiday.\r\n\r\nThe increase in wild love, in sexual intercourse dependent upon the\r\ninclination of the moment and upon chance, with a rapid succession of\r\ndifferent individuals--this increase, which is associated in the way\r\nabove described with the sensual life, is a characteristic of our own\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIn addition to prostitution, which we shall treat in a separate chapter,\r\nthe so-called “=intimacy=” constitutes the true nucleus of wild love.\r\nWhen those who support coercive marriage speak of free love, they do not\r\nmean the free love, the higher individual love, which we have described\r\nin the previous chapter, but they always refer to the latter-day\r\n“intimacy,” which, in fact, does involve the most serious dangers, alike\r\nfrom the physical and from the moral point of view; for, on the one\r\nhand, the “intimacy” forms the principal intermediate agent in the wider\r\ndiffusion of venereal diseases, and, on the other hand, this new form\r\nof sexual relationship has above all introduced the element of\r\nhypocrisy, lying, and mistrust, which poisons love to-day, separates the\r\nsexes continually more each from the other, and gives rise to that\r\ntragic =sexual hate=, enmity of men on the part of women, and misogyny\r\non the part of men, which is also peculiarly characteristic of our own\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe gradual differentiation of the originally ideal intimacy, to the\r\nwild love of the present day, has been admirably described and\r\npsychologically elucidated by Hellpach in his short work on “Love and\r\nAmatory Life in the Nineteenth Century.”\r\n\r\nIn this admirable characterization of the “intimacy,” the fact is first\r\nestablished, that it is above all and through and through a product of\r\ngreat towns, and consequently that it is closely connected with the\r\ncapitalistic evolution which compels thousands of young girls to earn\r\ntheir own living, so that from them are especially recruited the great\r\nhuman class of shop-girls, and all the allied varieties, so typical of\r\nlarge towns. This is the soil in which the “intimacy” naturally\r\ndevelops. [Hellpach writes first of conditions of a generation ago, and\r\nthen passes on thirty years to our own day.]\r\n\r\n  “By day these girls were occupied. When the evening came, bringing\r\n  with it the greatly desired closing of the shop, the prospect opened\r\n  to them of going home to poor surroundings, often enough of taking\r\n  part in painful family scenes, then going to bed, and the next morning\r\n  early returning to business. This was their life, day in, day out.\r\n  Here was no very pleasant calendar, especially when the way from the\r\n  places of business to their home led through streets crowded with\r\n  brilliantly lighted beer saloons, cafes, theatres, and concert-halls.\r\n  And all this during the years of sexual blossoming, when the ardent\r\n  sensual desire for the first time ran through all the nerves! Who can\r\n  wonder that the longing became absolutely fiery, after all the work of\r\n  the day, to enjoy a little share of all the glories of the great town\r\n  which lay extended before their gaze? After the confinement of the\r\n  shop, not to return straightway to the confinement of the family, but\r\n  to learn to know a little about the freedom of pleasure--and this\r\n  under the most entrancing form of a little love affair?\r\n\r\n  “And the social conditions were such as to make it possible for this\r\n  yearning to be fulfilled. Were there not thousands of young shopmen,\r\n  hundreds of students, clerks, non-commissioned officers, who would\r\n  rather walk about in the evening with a girl on their arm than alone?\r\n  Prostitutes would be little suited for such companionship. Besides, it\r\n  would not be always the young man’s intention to proceed to an\r\n  extremity, to have a night of love following the evening of amusement;\r\n  the young man simply was in the mood to walk about with the girl, to\r\n  gossip, perhaps to embrace and kiss her a little.\r\n\r\n  “Here was the beginning. The young man accosted a shop-girl,\r\n  accompanied her a little way, made an appointment for the following\r\n  evening; then he went a little further; he saw how pleased the little\r\n  one was; the _tutoyer_ and the kiss followed. So it went on for a few\r\n  evenings, and the young man felt that the happy girl was quite as\r\n  eager as he himself was to take the last step; and when this was done,\r\n  there was the “intimacy” complete. And in all respects it appeared\r\n  preferable to prostitution; it was inexpensive, unassuming, very\r\n  pleasant, and--involved no risk to health. Moreover, to both this\r\n  amatory life did not seem a ‘necessary evil’ on the contrary, it was a\r\n  glorious pleasure, and there were only two little shadows in the\r\n  bright picture: the fear of having a child, and the thought of\r\n  separation. Moreover, this cloud troubled the man only; girls then, as\r\n  to-day, thought very little about matters so remote.\r\n\r\n  “In the development of the ‘intimacy’ during the last thirty years,\r\n  many details have undergone change, but the picture as a whole has\r\n  been but little affected. The young shop-girl of to-day does not need\r\n  a long courting; she enters her business already fully aware that she\r\n  will soon be ‘intimate’ with some one. At first she will always prefer\r\n  to choose a man of whom it is possible to assume that he may marry\r\n  her. A young shopman, a non-commissioned officer, will, therefore, be\r\n  most in demand. It is not till later, when resignation comes, and the\r\n  only remaining wish is for amusement, that University students have\r\n  the preference; they are jollier, more entertaining, and the girl is\r\n  vain about their position. That has all remained just as it used to\r\n  be; only thirty years ago there were many shop-girls who,\r\n  notwithstanding all their desire, remained untouched. For the girl\r\n  brought up in the atmosphere of the lower middle classes there was a\r\n  certain ill-odour about free sexual intercourse. =This has completely\r\n  passed away.= The girls of this stratum, who, with open eyes,\r\n  withstand all allurements, might be counted on the fingers. At the\r\n  present day, these ‘intimacies’ extend deeply into the middle classes\r\n  of society.\r\n\r\n  “As regards the men, there has certainly been one marked change. The\r\n  illusion that sexual intercourse with an ‘intimate’ offered any\r\n  guarantee against the danger of venereal disease has now long been\r\n  dispelled. We are to-day confronted with the fact that the intimacy is\r\n  the focus of venereal infection to a far greater extent[241] than is\r\n  actual prostitution. In order to understand this, we must glance at\r\n  the dissolution of the intimacy.\r\n\r\n  “We have already pointed out that in the German ‘intimacy’ there has\r\n  never occurred a thorough development of a life like that of the\r\n  Parisian ‘grisette’; and there will be no change in this respect\r\n  within a time which we can at present foresee. Even in Berlin there\r\n  are not many dwellings in which the landlord would tolerate the visits\r\n  of ladies of doubtful reputation on any account whatever. But even\r\n  those who let quarters on easy terms, or, as the student calls them,\r\n  ‘storm-free’ rooms, would never allow their lodger to entertain a\r\n  woman day after day, and could not do so without running the risk of\r\n  being suspected by the police of procurement. Thus, the only thing\r\n  that unites the two parties in the intimacy is in almost all cases\r\n  sexual intercourse. The characteristic of grisette-love, the prose of\r\n  the life in common, day after day, is hardly ever experienced in the\r\n  ‘intimacy.’ =In consequence of this, on the man’s side satiety very\r\n  readily ensues.= New impressions enchain and stimulate him. He breaks\r\n  off the intimacy, and this is not usually done with tenderness. The\r\n  possibilities are numerous, but the only decent way, the open verbal\r\n  communication of the fact, is probably the rarest. He breaks off the\r\n  intimacy without a word, and as far as he is concerned the matter is\r\n  at an end; he is richer by an agreeable experience, and after a while\r\n  begins to look round once more.\r\n\r\n  “The girl also. But for her, this dissolution of the intimacy is very\r\n  often the first step upon a very steep downward path. At first there\r\n  perhaps ensues a short period of bitterness, but the sexual impulse\r\n  makes light of all other activities; a new intimacy begins. And now,\r\n  gradually, the idea gains ground in her mind that a change in love is,\r\n  after all, not such a bad thing. The second breach is borne with\r\n  equanimity; =and very soon it is by no means rare for the girl to\r\n  limit her love associations to a few days, and ultimately, as a matter\r\n  of daily custom, to seek fresh gratification with a new associate=. It\r\n  is not yet professional prostitution; psychologically also there is\r\n  still a difference. There is still sensual perception at the root of\r\n  her actions, and of such a strength, increasing owing to excess in\r\n  sexual intercourse, that the personality of the partner in the sexual\r\n  act becomes almost a matter of indifference. But now an economic\r\n  difficulty commonly intervenes: discharge from her position, expulsion\r\n  from her parents’ house, either or both being due to her dissipated\r\n  life, with its heedlessness and the resulting dislike to hard\r\n  work--and then the avalanche falls. Hunger drives her to do that for\r\n  payment which hitherto she has done only for the gratification of her\r\n  own desires. Prostitution has one victim the more.\r\n\r\n  “But the whole period between the beginning of the second intimacy and\r\n  her enrolment in the list of prostitutes by the police offers to all\r\n  her lovers the greatest possible danger of venereal infection. =For\r\n  the majority of girls actually become infected in their very first\r\n  intimacy.= The explanation of this goes back to the time in which the\r\n  intimacy first began to become fashionable, and in which the control\r\n  of prostitutes with regard to their condition of health was even more\r\n  defective, and the safeguarding against the danger of venereal\r\n  infection was even less understood than at the present day. In the\r\n  majority of cases the young men of the large towns were infected in\r\n  their very first experience of love; for it was with prostitutes that\r\n  they always sought their first sexual gratification, as is still\r\n  customary at the present day. For the inexperienced youth this course\r\n  is easier, making, as it does, fewer demands on his adroitness, and\r\n  none at all on his seductive skill; whereas in the formation of an\r\n  ‘intimacy’ these qualities are somewhat in demand. Later, when he had\r\n  had enough of prostitution, he sought an ‘intimate,’ and since at that\r\n  time the treatment of gonorrhœa was still extremely defective, he\r\n  promptly infected his partner in the intimacy. =In this manner the\r\n  girls engaged in intimacies, since they first became fashionable, have\r\n  been systematically infected.=”\r\n\r\nNext to =prostitution=, the =intimacy= is the great focus of sexual\r\ninfection; and wild love, from the psychological and ethical points of\r\nview, involves the same danger as prostitution. The frequent changes,\r\nthe multiplicity of sexual intercourse in intimacies, allows no deeper\r\nspiritual relationships to be formed; thus, the girls are debased to\r\nbecome the simple objects of physical sensuality, and they are forced\r\nmore and more to depend on the financially stronger men; thus, they\r\nrapidly become partial or complete prostitutes. To them now the sensual\r\nlife, the pursuit of pleasure, is the principal thing, not love.\r\nVenereal infection is soon superadded, to deprave them more thoroughly.\r\nStill worse is the corruption of the world of men, who transfer to the\r\nintimacy the practices they have learned in their association with\r\nprostitutes; but, above all, they come finally to seek and to desire the\r\nrude sexual act solely for its own sake, without feeling the need for\r\nany deeper spiritual association. Hence results the fugitive character\r\nof these sexual relationships, the frequent changes on both sides, and\r\nthe end--=lies, mistrust, hatred=.\r\n\r\nBelief in and hope for true love disappear for ever; there remains only\r\nthe cold, desolate, unspeakably embittered disillusionment, the\r\n=distrust= of the other sex which is so characteristic of our time.\r\nNever before were there so many woman-haters and man-haters on\r\nprinciple. In the intercourse between the sexes, neither believes the\r\nother any longer; and on both sides the “intimacy” is entered on without\r\nany illusions, the sole aim of both parties being to satisfy in the\r\nintensest possible way their desire for enjoyment and their sensual\r\nlusts.\r\n\r\nProstitution can destroy no illusions, for its true character is\r\nmanifest at the first glance; but the modern intimacy has become the\r\ngrave of love, and has given rise to a new corruption of the sexual\r\nlife, which appears almost more dangerous than the old corruption\r\ndependent on prostitution. It has, moreover, become a second, and not\r\nless dangerous, focus of venereal infection, to the diffusion of which\r\nit is extraordinarily favourable.\r\n\r\nHe, therefore, who wishes to take part in the fight against the moral\r\ndegeneration of our amatory life, and to assist in the campaign against\r\nvenereal diseases, =must attack and endeavour to suppress the modern\r\ndevelopment of the life of “intimacy” just as energetically as he\r\nattacks prostitution=.\r\n\r\nThe =wild love= of the present day, “extra-conjugal” sexual intercourse\r\n(which, as I cannot too often repeat, has nothing whatever to do with\r\n“free love”), and =coercive marriage=, are the true causes of sexual\r\ncorruption. They are intimately associated one with the other. The\r\nsocial, economic, and spiritual civilization of the present day demands\r\nfree love, with which neither coercive marriage nor wild love is\r\ncompatible.\r\n\r\nNeither for prostitution, nor for the wild extra-conjugal sexual\r\nintercourse of our time, can any justification be found from the point\r\nof view of medicine, racial hygiene, or sociology. In their nature both\r\nlead to the same end: the death and destruction of all individual love,\r\nof all the finer activities of love, by which the spiritual nature of\r\nman is so greatly enriched; and they both give rise to a continuous\r\nincrease and rapid diffusion of venereal diseases.\r\n\r\nThe salvation of our people is not to be found in the “recommendation”\r\nof extra-conjugal sexual intercourse for all those who are not in a\r\nposition to marry--and the number of these grows from day to day--but it\r\nis to be found in the =reform of marriage=, in a =freer= configuration\r\nof the amatory life, in connexion with which we can confidently trust\r\nIbsen’s saying in the “Lady from the Sea”:\r\n\r\n  “We can’t get away from this--that a voluntary promise is to the full\r\n  as binding as a marriage.”\r\n\r\nThere shall not and must not be “=sexual freedom=,”[242] but there must\r\nbe “freedom of love.”\r\n\r\nWhen anyone asks me whether I should advise him to indulge in\r\n“extra-conjugal sexual intercourse,” as a physician and a man of science\r\nI am compelled to answer with a bald “No,” because I cannot undertake\r\nthe responsibility of the consequences of such advice.\r\n\r\nFortunately, alike in the world of women and in the world of men, there\r\nmanifests itself an increasing disapproval of wild love as it exhibits\r\nitself in the modern “intimacies.” There are already numerous intimacies\r\nwhich closely resemble free love, and in which all the conditions of\r\nfree love are fulfilled, in respect of duration, of a profound spiritual\r\nrelationship, a sense of sexual responsibility alike physical and\r\nmoral, and in the joyful acceptance of the consequences in respect of\r\noffspring.\r\n\r\nWe must, however, continually keep up the fight against wild love as the\r\nenduring associate of prostitution, to which it constitutes the bridge\r\nor stage of transition. Therein lies its greatest danger. This we shall\r\nrecognize more clearly in the ensuing chapter, in which we turn to\r\nconsider the subject of =prostitution=.\r\n\r\n  [219] In the titular heading to this chapter, throughout the chapter,\r\n  and in most cases throughout the book, the German word _Verführung_\r\n  has been translated as _seduction_. _Verführung_ means “leading\r\n  astray,” and one of the commonest uses of the term is to denote\r\n  _sexual_ leading astray--the _seduction_ of a woman by a man. But in\r\n  some cases _Verführung_, like the English _seduction_, is used in its\r\n  more primitive and wider signification. The context will suffice to\r\n  show the sense in which the word is employed.--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n  [220] Thus, at the present day, in quite small country towns, we find\r\n  variety theatres and low music-halls; and with these, prostitutes are\r\n  commonly introduced into the town, so that the wild love, which was\r\n  previously free from danger, now becomes a focus of venereal\r\n  infection.\r\n\r\n  [221] Willy Hellpach, “Our Sensual Life and Venereal Diseases,”\r\n  published in the “Reports of the German Society for the Suppression of\r\n  Venereal Diseases,” 1905, vol. iii., Nos. 5 and 6, pp. 103-105.\r\n\r\n  [222] Of this work there recently appeared an excellent German\r\n  translation, admirably modernized in blank verse by Karl Ettlinger,\r\n  “Ovid’s Art of Love: a Modern Translation.” (An English translation of\r\n  Ovid’s “Art of Love,” revised by Charles W.

H. Hübner, and\r\n  others, that chronic alcoholism constitutes an important cause of\r\n  prostitution in the case of the so-called “late prostitutes”--that is\r\n  to say, in those women who do not commence a life of professional\r\n  prostitution at puberty, but usually after the age of twenty-five\r\n  years. _Cf._ Artur Hermann Hübner, “Prostitutes in Relation to\r\n  Criminal Jurisdiction,” published in _Monatsschr. für\r\n  Kriminalpsychologie_, edited by G. Aschaffenburg, 1907, p. 5.\r\n\r\n  [240] At the great public dinner which, in 1890, the town of Berlin\r\n  gave in the Rathaus to the members of the International Medical\r\n  Congress, and at which 4,000 persons consumed 15,382 bottles of wine,\r\n  22 hectolitres (484 gallons) of beer, and 300 bottles of brandy, there\r\n  were witnessed in and outside the Rathaus the most disgusting scenes\r\n  of drunkenness. “As the blowflies gather round a piece of carrion, so\r\n  in the street in front of the Rathaus there had gathered a swarm of\r\n  prostitutes, who found a rich booty among the drunken, staggering\r\n  guests” (_cf._ Rosenfeld, _op. cit._, p. 325).--A striking example of\r\n  the manner in which alcohol sometimes completely annihilates every\r\n  æsthetic perception is reported by E. Kraepelin (“The Psychiatric\r\n  Duties of the State,” p. 6; Jena, 1900): “A number of students were\r\n  infected by a prostitute, who from early youth had been weak-minded,\r\n  and who was suffering from both lupus of the nose and recent\r\n  syphilis.”\r\n\r\n  [241] It is not yet quite so bad as this. But the number of venereal\r\n  infections that occur in consequence of wild love, and of free sexual\r\n  intercourse in these relations of “intimacy,” is continually on the\r\n  increase.\r\n\r\n  [242] Sexual freedom--that is to say, the formal organization of\r\n  sexual promiscuity--was demanded by a certain Dr. Roderich Hellmann in\r\n  a book which has now become very rare, because it was confiscated\r\n  immediately after publication. Its title was “Sexual Freedom: a\r\n  Philosophic Attempt to Increase Human Happiness” (Berlin, 1878). The\r\n  author demands that immediately after puberty “the sexual organs shall\r\n  have the opportunity of a regulated activity,” and that it shall now\r\n  be allowed to persons of both sexes “to indulge in sexual intercourse\r\n  as much as they please,” of course, with the avoidance of injury to\r\n  health and of pregnancy. This remarkable freak proceeds to demand that\r\n  public lavatories shall be done away with, so that persons of both\r\n  sexes shall relieve themselves freely in one another’s presence in the\r\n  open street, and, with equal freedom, shall display their sexual\r\n  organs to one another for the purpose of sexual allurement!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nPROSTITUTION\r\n\r\n\r\n  “_On that one degraded and ignoble form are concentrated the passions\r\n  that might have filled the world with shame. She remains, while creeds\r\n  and civilizations arise and fall, the eternal priestess of humanity,\r\n  blasted for the sins of the people._”--LECKY.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS OF CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n  Prostitution and venereal disease the central problem of the sexual\r\n  question -- My belief in the possibility of the suppression of both --\r\n  Only in recent years has the scientific attack on both begun -- The\r\n  _plaie sociale_ -- Internal and local treatment -- The scientific\r\n  literature of prostitution -- Rosenbaum’s work on prostitution in\r\n  antiquity -- Aretino, Delgado, and Veniero on the prostitution of the\r\n  renascence -- Franckenaus’s first medical polemic against brothels --\r\n  The commencement of the scientific study of prostitution and venereal\r\n  diseases in the eighteenth century -- Rétif de la Bretonne and his\r\n  “Pornographe” -- “Moral Control” -- Parent-Duchatelet’s fundamental\r\n  work -- Analysis of this book -- Contemporary works on prostitution in\r\n  Paris, London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Lisbon, Lyons, and Algiers -- First\r\n  employment of the term “male prostitution” -- A peculiar species of\r\n  souteneur -- Prostitution in Hamburg -- Dr. Lippert’s book -- “Memoirs\r\n  of a Prostitute,” the predecessor of the “Diary of a Lost Woman” --\r\n  Gross-Hoffinger’s book on “Prostitution in Austria” -- Demonstration\r\n  of the connexion between prostitution and coercive marriage --\r\n  Celebrated chapter on “Maidservants and Prostitution” -- Schrank on\r\n  prostitution in Vienna -- Prostitution in Leipzig -- In New York --\r\n  General works on prostitution -- Jeannel, Acton and Hügel -- Books on\r\n  secret prostitution, on prostitution of girls under age, on regulation\r\n  and on brothels, and on the social importance of prostitution --\r\n  Blaschko’s recent critical investigation on the subject of\r\n  prostitution -- Results of this investigation -- Lombroso’s\r\n  anthropological theory -- The works of Tarnowsky and Ströhmberg, of\r\n  Fiaux and von Düring.\r\n\r\n  Conception and definition of prostitution -- Genuine and\r\n  pseudo-prostitutes -- Prostitution among primitive peoples --\r\n  Religious prostitution as the germinal form of modern prostitution --\r\n  This latter the product of the growth of large towns -- Medieval\r\n  conditions -- Diminution in the number of brothels since that time --\r\n  The demand for prostitutes -- Relation between the number of\r\n  prostitutes and the male population -- The supply greater than the\r\n  demand -- Causes of the male demand for prostitutes -- Prostitution as\r\n  a product of civilization -- Repression of primitive sexual instincts\r\n  by civilization -- The sexual supra- and sub-consciousness --\r\n  Transient elemental activities of the sub-consciousness -- Reports of\r\n  J.

The abolition of prostitution and the\r\nsuppression of venereal diseases would be almost tantamount to the\r\nsolution of the entire sexual problem. Imagine the extension and the\r\nintension of the idea: No prostitution, no more venereal disease!\r\n\r\nThere is, in fact, no more gratifying notion, no more illuminating\r\nideal, than that of moral and physical purity in the relations between\r\nthe sexes. At a time in which, especially in social spheres, such\r\nabundant activity and such far-seeing ideas of reform are apparent, this\r\nnotion of a campaign against prostitution and venereal diseases, in the\r\nhope of eradicating both evils, should stand in the forefront of all the\r\ndemands of civilization, in order that finally the tragical influence,\r\nthe poisonous sting, should be removed from the disordered, unhappy,\r\namatory life of the present day, and herewith, unquestionably, a proper\r\n=foundation= should be laid for a more beautiful future for that life.\r\nThis idea is unique; it is the greatest of all that man, at length\r\nbecome self-conscious,[243] has ever grasped; and to this idea belongs\r\nthe future!\r\n\r\nThe French term prostitution and venereal diseases _une plaie sociale_,\r\na rodent ulcer in the body of society. I take this apt comparison, and\r\ncarry it a stage further, to show a clear picture of the way along which\r\nwe must go in order to eradicate prostitution; for in this respect I am\r\na confirmed optimist. I =believe= in the possibility of the eradication\r\nof venereal diseases, and of the abolition of prostitution within the\r\ncivilized world by national and international measures. I do not join in\r\nthe chorus of those who say, “because prostitution has always existed,\r\nit must always exist in the future; because venereal diseases have\r\nalways[244] existed, they are unavoidable accompaniments of\r\ncivilization.”\r\n\r\n=How long is it=, then, since any attempt has been made to oppose\r\nprostitution and venereal diseases? As regards the latter, it is only\r\nwithin the =last few years= that we have begun, in the battle against\r\nthem, to make systematic use of the results of scientific research; and\r\nthe study of prostitution, and the measures based on that study for its\r\ncontrol and prevention, do not date further back than the second half of\r\nthe eighteenth century. In fact, for practical purposes, they date from\r\nthe appearance of the classical and epoch-making work of\r\nParent-Duchatelet (1836).\r\n\r\nWe are, indeed, =in the very first stages= of the campaign against\r\nprostitution and venereal diseases. All that has hitherto been done has\r\nbeen to make inadequate, isolated attempts to introduce unsuitable and\r\nhalf-considered regulations, based upon successive misconceptions, which\r\nhave only made matters worse. =To-day= medicine, social science,\r\npedagogy, jurisprudence, and ethics have combined in a =common=\r\ncampaign; and this is not national merely, but unites all civilized\r\nnations in a common cause.\r\n\r\nHere we find an actual prospect, a credible hope, of a radical cure of\r\nthe _plaie sociale_. But such an ulcer can only be radically cured when\r\nwe are not content merely with the =local= treatment of the existing\r\nsore; we must simultaneously attack the =internal= causes of this\r\nchronic disease, and in the case with which we have to do the internal\r\ncauses are even more important than the external--that is to say,\r\n=ethics=, =pedagogy=, and =social science= are even more important and\r\nindispensable in the campaign against prostitution than =medicine= and\r\n=hygiene=. We shall never attain our goal by considering and fighting\r\nprostitution and venereal diseases, the consequences of prostitution,\r\npurely from the medical and hygienic standpoint. In this case,\r\none-sidedness will prove tantamount to failure. The problem of\r\nprostitution must be approached from many sides, because the causes that\r\nhave to be considered are =manifold=, alike anthropological, economic,\r\nsocial, and psychological, in their nature. There are =many varieties=\r\nof prostitution; in the same way there are numerous and various =types=\r\nof prostitutes. It is, therefore, impossible for one who is acquainted\r\nwith actual life to hold fast in a one-sided manner to a single theory.\r\nThus, in one and the same case the most various points of view have to\r\nbe considered.\r\n\r\nThe =history= of prostitution is an extremely interesting chapter of the\r\ngeneral history of civilization, which has =not hitherto= been written\r\nin a manner satisfying scientific and critical demands; but the\r\n=literature= of prostitution is already alarmingly comprehensive. Here,\r\nalso, critical grasp and mode of presentation are still entirely\r\nwanting. It is impossible, in this place, in which we speak only of the\r\npresent-day conditions, to enter at any length into the historical and\r\nliterary aspects of the question of prostitution. This I must leave for\r\na later, comprehensive work, for which I have for several years been\r\ncollecting the materials. Here I shall only briefly refer, for the sake\r\nof the reader interested in the matter, to the most important writings\r\non the subject of prostitution which have any scientific and historical\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nProstitution in antiquity is treated in a masterly manner by Julius\r\nRosenbaum in his celebrated “History of Syphilis in Antiquity” (Halle,\r\n1839); this is, down to the present day, the chief source of our\r\nknowledge of the conditions in antiquity. It is true that he starts from\r\nthe false assumption that syphilis already existed in ancient times, a\r\nview which in the second volume of my book on the “Origin of Syphilis”\r\n(now in course of preparation) I show to be incorrect; this work will\r\nalso contain a thorough study of prostitution among the ancients, based\r\nupon the more recent researches published since the year 1839, when\r\nRosenbaum’s book appeared.\r\n\r\nThe first truly classical descriptions of the nature of modern\r\nprostitution dated from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; these\r\nare not scientific, belonging rather to the province of belles-lettres;\r\nbut they are of great value in respect of the accuracy of their\r\nobservations, and of their psychological insight into the nature of\r\nprostitution. I refer above all to the celebrated “Ragionamenti” of\r\nPietro Aretino;[245] next, to the not less important work, published\r\nearlier, in 1528, “Lozana Andaluza,” by Francisco Delgado (Francesco\r\nDelicado).[246] Both these books, and also the celebrated “Zafetta” of\r\nLorenzo Veniero (_circa_ 1535), describe the conditions of prostitution\r\nat the time of the Italian renascence; these display a most astonishing\r\nsimilarity to the conditions of the present day, and the books mentioned\r\nhave therefore still an instructive value.[247]\r\n\r\nFrom the seventeenth century we have as important documents of\r\ncivilization the description of prostitution in Holland in the\r\ninteresting work “Le Putanisme d’Amsterdam” (Brussels, 1883; the\r\noriginal Dutch edition, Amsterdam, 1681), and also in the work published\r\nin the same year, 1681, “Disputatio Medica qua Lupanaria ex Principiis\r\nquoque Medicis Improbantur,” by Georg Franck von Franckenau,[248]\r\nnoteworthy as being the first medical polemic against brothels.\r\n\r\nDown to the middle of the nineteenth century the study of prostitution\r\nwas most active in France.[249] In the second half of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, according to the expression of the de Goncourts,\r\n“pornognomonie” was a scientific problem. Various attempts at reform\r\nwere made; as early as 1763 “=moral control=” was recommended; and in\r\n1769 there appeared the celebrated “Pornographe” of Rétif de la\r\nBretonne,[250] the first extensive work on the =state regulation= of\r\nprostitution, the great historical importance of which was recognized by\r\nMireur, the well-known syphilologist of Marseilles, by the publication\r\nof a new edition (Brussels, 1879).\r\n\r\nBut it was with the publication of the immortal and most admirable work\r\nof Parent-Duchatelet,[251] on prostitution in Paris, that in the year\r\n1836 the modern =scientific= literature of prostitution really began. It\r\nis the first work in which full justice is done to the importance of\r\nprostitution in =all= its relations, and it is based upon exact medical\r\nobservations and psychological and social studies. Even to-day it\r\nremains unique in its kind, and a standing example of critical research\r\nand of French learned zeal.\r\n\r\nA very short account of the contents of this epoch-making book of\r\nParent-Duchatelet will best teach us its importance, and will give us an\r\ninsight into all the problems connected with prostitution, and\r\nconsidered by the French author.\r\n\r\nIn the introduction, Parent-Duchatelet explains the reasons which led\r\nhim to undertake the work, and the literary sources he has consulted.\r\nThe first chapter then proceeds to the consideration of certain general\r\nproblems, gives a =definition= of the term prostitute, an estimate of\r\nthe =number= of prostitutes in Paris, their =origin= in respect of\r\nnative country, position, culture, profession, their =age=, and the\r\n=first cause of their adoption of this profession=. The second chapter\r\ndiscusses the =manners and customs= of prostitutes, the opinion they\r\nhave of themselves, their religious ideas, their sense of shame, their\r\nspiritual qualities, tattooing, occupation, uncleanliness, speech,\r\ndefects and good qualities, the various classes of prostitutes, and,\r\nfinally, the _souteneurs_. The third chapter contains =physiological\r\nobservations= concerning prostitutes--namely, concerning their obesity,\r\nthe changes in their voice, peculiarities in the colour of the hair and\r\nthe eyes, the stature, the condition of the genital organs, and\r\nfertility. In the fourth chapter he deals with the =influence of\r\nprofessional prostitution on the health of the girls=, and describes the\r\nvarious morbid conditions which may result from their occupation. The\r\nfifth chapter treats of the public =houses of prostitution= (brothels),\r\ntheir advantages and disadvantages, the question of brothel streets, and\r\nthe localization of prostitution in definite quarters of the town. In\r\nthe sixth chapter the =inscription of prostitutes in police lists= is\r\ndiscussed; in the seventh =procurement and the owners of brothels=.\r\nChapters eight, nine, and ten deal with =secret prostitution= in houses\r\nof accommodation, drinking-saloons, coffee-houses, tobacconists’ shops,\r\netc.; chapter eleven discusses =street prostitution=; chapter twelve,\r\nthe =diffusion of prostitution= in the various parts of Paris; chapter\r\nthirteen, the =relation of prostitution to military life=; chapter\r\nfourteen, =prostitution in the environs of Paris=. The fifteenth chapter\r\ndescribes the =ultimate destiny= of prostitutes; the sixteenth deals\r\nwith their =medical treatment=--above all, the methods of examination to\r\nascertain their state of health are accurately described. Chapters\r\nseventeen and eighteen deal with =hospitals= and =prisons= for\r\nprostitutes; chapter nineteen, with the former taxation of prostitutes;\r\nchapter twenty considers =questions relating to administration, and the\r\nspecial branch of police dealing with the institution=--for example, the\r\nsuggestion (recently revived) is discussed of the medical examination of\r\nthe male clients of prostitutes; prurient pictures and books are also\r\nconsidered, and thefts in brothels. The twenty-first chapter is devoted\r\nto the question which still attracts attention at the present day, viz.,\r\nthe =peculiar relationship between the owner of a house and the\r\nprostitutes living there=, and deals also with the legal aspect of the\r\npunishments decreed against prostitutes. Chapter twenty-two is occupied\r\nwith a general discussion of the =legal questions= connected with\r\nprostitution. At the conclusion, in chapters twenty-three and\r\ntwenty-four, the author discusses the question =whether prostitutes are\r\nnecessary=, and this question (_nota bene_, from the standpoint of\r\ncoercive marriage morality) he answers in the affirmative; he asks also\r\n=whether the police should be entrusted with the application of measures\r\nfor the prevention of venereal diseases=, and this he agrees to\r\nconditionally only, for he considers that the =public= recommendation of\r\nprotective measures should be forbidden by police ordinance. Finally, in\r\nthe last chapter, the twenty-fifth, he speaks of the =institutions for\r\nthe rescue of fallen women=, and he concludes his comprehensive work, in\r\nwhich he has dealt so thoroughly with all the subdivisions of his\r\ngeneral topic, with the words:\r\n\r\n  “My work is at an end. When I commenced it, I pointed out what reasons\r\n  I had for undertaking it, what aim I wished to attain. Had I not been\r\n  firmly convinced that the investigations begun by me regarding the\r\n  nature of prostitutes might favour health and morality, I should not\r\n  have published them. I have exposed to the public gaze great\r\n  infirmities of mankind; thoughtful men, for whom I have written, will\r\n  thank me for doing so. He who loves his fellow-men will without\r\n  anxiety follow me into the department of knowledge I have described,\r\n  and will not turn away his glance from the pictures I have drawn. =He\r\n  who wishes to know the good that remains to be done, and who wishes to\r\n  learn how to pursue with good results the way by which something\r\n  better is to be attained, must first know what actually exists; he\r\n  must know the truth.=\r\n\r\n  “The profession of prostitution is an evil of all times, all\r\n  countries, and appears to be innate in the social structure of\r\n  mankind. It will perhaps never be entirely eradicated; still, all the\r\n  more we must strive to limit its extent and its dangers. With\r\n  prostitution itself it is as with vice, crime, and disease; the\r\n  teacher of morals endeavours to prevent the vices, the lawgiver to\r\n  prevent the crimes, the physician to cure the diseases. All alike know\r\n  that they will never fully attain their goal; but they pursue their\r\n  work none the less in the conviction that he who does only a little\r\n  good yet does a great service to the weak man. I follow their example.\r\n  A friend whose loss I shall always mourn drew my attention to the fate\r\n  of the prostitute. I studied them, I wished to learn the causes of\r\n  their degradation, and wherever possible to discover the means by\r\n  which their number could be limited. What experience has taught me on\r\n  this subject I have openly stated, and I am convinced that the\r\n  lawgiver, the man whom the State has empowered with authority to care\r\n  for public health and morality, will find in my book useful\r\n  information.”\r\n\r\nParent-Duchatelet’s book, no less admirable in its execution than in its\r\ndesign, still remains the foundation for the scientific study of\r\nprostitution. It is the exemplar for all contemporary and subsequent\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nThe powerful influence exercised by this book was shown above all in\r\nthis--that works on prostitution appeared in rapid succession in the\r\nvarious capitals of the civilized world. These were all based to a\r\ngreater or less extent upon the work of Parent-Duchatelet, and thus they\r\nconstitute extremely valuable scientific monographs regarding the\r\nconditions of prostitution in particular towns, such as since that date\r\nhave not been issued. Here there still lies hidden a wealth of material,\r\na large part of which has not yet been utilized.\r\n\r\nAs an enlargement and continuation of the work of Parent-Duchatelet,\r\nthere appeared three years later, in the year 1839, the work of the\r\nCommissary of Police Béraud[252] on the prostitutes of Paris and on the\r\nParisian _police des mœurs_. The book is more especially distinguished\r\nby an elaborate history of prostitution, and by the wealth of\r\npsychological observations it contains; also by its exact information\r\nregarding secret prostitution.\r\n\r\nIn the same year a well-known London physician, Dr. Michael Ryan,[253]\r\npublished his important book on =Prostitution in London=,[254] with a\r\ncomparison of the conditions in Paris and New York. Ryan first dealt\r\nwith the general =social= and =economic= causes of prostitution, with\r\ncritical acumen, as we could not but expect from an Englishman. His book\r\nalso contained an interesting account of the extraordinary diffusion in\r\nEngland at that time of pornographic books and pictures,[255] and\r\nconcerning their publication and sale by pedlars, and the measures\r\nundertaken to repress this traffic. Valuable also are the detailed\r\nreports given in this book, on pp. 212-252, regarding prostitution in\r\nthe United States, and especially in New York.\r\n\r\nThe example of Ryan was followed by his countrymen, Dr. William Tait and\r\nthe Rev. Ralph Wardlaw. The former treated in a comprehensive work the\r\nsubject of prostitution in Edinburgh;[256] the latter, in a shorter\r\nbook, described prostitution in Glasgow.[257]\r\n\r\nVery interesting is the book, of which a few copies only ever reached\r\nGermany (one of which is in my own possession), and which even in\r\nPortugal is extremely rare, of Dr. Francisco Ignacio dos Santos Cruz\r\nregarding prostitution in Lisbon,[258] in which the whole subject of\r\nPortuguese prostitution is admirably described, with special reference\r\nto the capital city. Santos Cruz gives most careful attention to the\r\nlegislative aspect of the question. He was the first to advocate a\r\nmeasure which has recently been proposed also by Lesser (doubtless in\r\nignorance of the work of his predecessor)--viz., the =formation of\r\npolyclinics for the gratuitous treatment of prostitutes=.[259]\r\n\r\nRegarding prostitution in the town of Lyons, renowned for its\r\nimmorality, Dr. Potton wrote a celebrated book, which received a prize\r\nfrom the Medical Society of Lyons in the year 1841. This work was based\r\non official sources, and had especial reference to the relationships of\r\nprostitution to the hygienic and economic conditions of the\r\npopulation.[260]\r\n\r\nA valuable book, also, is the work on prostitution in Algiers by E. A.\r\nDuchesne.[261] It contains an elaborate account of “=male\r\nprostitution=”--that is, prostitution of men for men--an expansion of\r\nthe idea of prostitution which is, as far as my knowledge goes, found\r\nhere for the first time. Naturally, in earlier works we find allusions\r\nto men who practise pederasty for money, but the idea “prostitution” had\r\nhitherto been strictly limited to the class of purchasable women.\r\n\r\nWe see this, for example, in the anonymous book “=Prostitution in\r\nBerlin, and its Victims=,”[262] published in Berlin seven years before\r\nthe appearance of the work of Duchesne. The author definitely states\r\nthat “the admirable book of Parent-Duchatelet on prostitution in the\r\ntown of Paris, and its remarkable success, have chiefly given occasion\r\nto the publication of my own work.” The book is, however, quite\r\nindependent in character, and treats of the individual relationships of\r\nprostitution in Berlin, on the basis of =official= sources and\r\nexperience, in historical, moral, medical, and political relations, and\r\nalso from the point of view of police administration. It contains an\r\nappendix on “=prostituted men=” (p. 207), who, however, are not\r\nhomosexual prostitutes, but, according to the writer’s own definition,\r\n“men who make it their profession to serve for payment =voluptuous\r\nwomen= by the gratification of the latter’s unnatural passions.” This\r\nspecies still exists at the present day, but there is no particular name\r\nfor the type. (In the seventies, in Vienna, men who could be hired to\r\nperform coitus were known locally as “stallions”--Ger. =Hengste=.) We\r\nmust include them in the great army of _souteneurs_, although the term\r\nis not strictly applicable. Later we shall return to the consideration\r\nof this peculiar variety of male prostitution.\r\n\r\nAs an enlargement of the work just mentioned, we can regard the book\r\npublished in the same year, 1846, by the Criminal Commissary, Dr. Carl\r\nRöhrmann, on =Prostitution in Berlin=.[263]\r\n\r\nThis book is especially remarkable from the fact that it contains\r\n“complete and candid biographies of the best-known prostitutes in\r\nBerlin,” an idea which has recently been revived, for example, in W.\r\nHammer’s “The Life-History of Ten Public Prostitutes in Berlin” (Berlin\r\nand Leipzig, 1905).\r\n\r\nVery valuable official material is, finally, to be found in a third work\r\non prostitution in Berlin, written by the celebrated syphilologist F. J.\r\nBehrend.[264] It begins with a careful history of the police regulations\r\nregarding prostitution in Berlin, then discusses the consequences of the\r\nabolition of the Berlin brothels in the year 1845, and proceeds to\r\ndemand new measures and regulations for the control of prostitution and\r\nfor the prevention of syphilis in Berlin. As a collection of material,\r\nthe book is of considerable value.\r\n\r\nLittle known, but thoroughly original, is the work of the Hamburg\r\nphysician, Dr. Lippert, on =prostitution in Hamburg=.[265] Blaschko even\r\nfails to mention it in the bibliography at the end of his own work,\r\npresently to be described. Lippert adduces numerous and interesting new\r\ncontributions to our knowledge of “the many-headed hydra, the\r\ncolour-changing chameleon,” of prostitution. After an introductory\r\nsketch regarding the historical development of prostitution in Hamburg,\r\nhe gives a “characterization of the present moral condition of Hamburg,”\r\nembodying important information regarding the number of brothel\r\nprostitutes and street-walkers, the topographical distribution of\r\nprostitution and of brothels, the secret houses of accommodation, the\r\nremarkable decline in the number of marriages, the relationship between\r\nlegitimate and illegitimate births, and the number of drinking-saloons\r\nand dancing-halls; and he goes on to describe with more detail these\r\nindividual factors of prostitution, and especially the opportunities\r\nfor prostitution. The third chapter contains an extremely interesting\r\nphysiological and pathological description of the Hamburg prostitutes.\r\nAccording to Lippert, the principal motives of prostitution are\r\n“=idleness=, =frivolity=, and, above all, the =love of finery=.” He\r\nrightly lays especial stress upon the last-named cause, which, in the\r\nmore recent scientific investigations regarding the causes of\r\nprostitution, has, unfortunately, been too much neglected. Then follow\r\ndata regarding the age, nationality, class, and occupation of\r\nprostitutes. We learn that as early as the date of this book of\r\nLippert’s the greatest number of public prostitutes had originally been\r\n=maidservants= (p. 79), not girls of the labouring classes. Thus the\r\nfact that prostitutes recruit their ranks chiefly from the servant class\r\nis not, as recent writers assert, exclusively the consequence of the\r\nincreasing mental culture of the modern proletariat, but is most\r\nprobably rather connected with the freer configuration of the amatory\r\nlife among the labouring classes, where the nobler form of “free love”\r\nhas long been dominant. From the very nature of the case, this must lead\r\nto a limitation of the supply of prostitutes from this class. The\r\nchapter closes with an elaborate description of the physical and mental\r\npeculiarities of the Hamburg prostitutes, and of the diseases observed\r\nin them. In the fourth chapter the various classes of prostitutes are\r\nconsidered more closely--the brothel prostitutes (with an exact\r\ndescription of the celebrated brothel streets of Hamburg), the\r\nprostitutes living alone, the street-walkers, the “kept women,” the\r\nlarge group of secret prostitutes. There follow in an appendix\r\ninteresting accounts of the public places which are related to\r\nprostitution; of prostitution in the Hamburger Berg and in the suburb of\r\nSt. Pauli; and of the rescue work of Hamburg.\r\n\r\nA very good account of prostitution in Hamburg is also found in a book\r\ncontemporary with that of Lippert, entitled “=Memoirs of a Prostitute,\r\nor Prostitution in Hamburg=” (St. Pauli, 1847). This work, which is now\r\nextraordinarily rare, resembles the book which recently gained such\r\ncelebrity, the “Tagebuch einer Verlorenen” (“Diary of a Lost Woman”), by\r\nMargaret Böhme, in that it was edited by a Dr. J. Zeisig, professedly\r\nafter the “original manuscript.” As usual, it has all happened before!\r\n\r\nIn the preface to his book, Lippert remarks that, since prostitution in\r\nBerlin and in Hamburg has now been adequately described, it was\r\ndesirable that an analogous book should be compiled regarding Vienna, in\r\norder that we might have the necessary comparative statistics of “the\r\nthree principal towns and principal factors of German prostitution.”\r\n\r\nThe actual account of prostitution in Vienna did not, however, appear\r\ntill forty years later, in the year 1886. Still, as early as 1847 the\r\nbook of Dr. Anton J. Gross-Hoffinger was published, describing\r\nexclusively the conditions of prostitution in Austria, and naturally\r\nchiefly concerned with conditions in Vienna.[266] In my opinion, this\r\nbook has an epoch-making significance, because therein we find asserted\r\nfor the first time, with all possible emphasis, that the institution of\r\n=coercive marriage= is the ultimate cause of prostitution, to which all\r\nthe other causes are subsidiary. In no other book do we find so painful\r\na description, drawn with such astonishing clearness, of the horrible\r\nconditions resulting from the artificial preservation of the official\r\nand ecclesiastical coercive marriage, which was really based upon\r\neconomic conditions peculiar to the remote past. The two first sections,\r\n“Woman the Slave of Civilization” and “Woman in her Degradation,” are\r\nthe most frightful accusations of conventional marriage. On pp. 190 and\r\n191 the author formulates in fifteen paragraphs a law of marriage\r\nreform, which has a very close resemblance to the previously described\r\nideas of Ellen Key. A perfect classic is the chapter on servant-girls\r\n(pp. 226-284), unique in its thoroughness, and affording an admirable\r\ndescription of the legal, moral, and economic relationships of domestic\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n  “=The great army of domestic servants=,” he writes, “=constitute the\r\n  ever-ready reserve force of prostitution. Daily from this reserve are\r\n  drawn new recruits for the regular service, and daily the vacant\r\n  places in the reserve are once more filled.=”\r\n\r\nGross-Hoffinger, in 1847, came also to the conclusion that in “free\r\nlove” or “free marriage” was to be found the only salvation from the\r\nmisery of prostitution.\r\n\r\nThe comprehensive work of Schrank upon prostitution in Vienna[267] is\r\ndistinguished by an abundance of interesting isolated observations, and\r\nthese are especially to be found in the earlier historical portion. The\r\nsecond part is occupied with the administration and hygiene of\r\nprostitution in Vienna. The work gives an exhaustive account of Viennese\r\nprostitution down to the year 1885.\r\n\r\nProstitution in Leipzig was described in three chapters of a general\r\nwork on prostitution, published in the year 1854.[268] The titles of\r\nthese three chapters are: “Moral Corruption in Leipzig”; “Tolerated\r\nProstitutes and Tolerated Houses in Leipzig”; “Tolerated Prostitutes in\r\nLeipzig: their Morals, their Customs, their Hygienic Condition, their\r\nEnd.” Very interesting is the statement of the author that of the 3,000\r\nmaidservants in Leipzig, _one-third_ were engaged in secret\r\nprostitution.\r\n\r\nThe prostitution in the largest town of the new world, in New York, also\r\nfound an admirable description in the sixth decade of the nineteenth\r\ncentury in the great historical work of the New York physician, William\r\nM. Sanger.[269] Of the 685 large octavo pages which the book contains,\r\npages 450 to 676 are devoted to the description of the conditions of\r\nprostitution in New York. The historical portion of the book is also\r\nextremely valuable, being based upon the best historical authorities.\r\n\r\nWith the year 1860, or thereabouts, this first period of the scientific\r\nliterature of prostitution, characterized by monographs dealing with\r\nindividual =towns=, in pursuance of the example of Parent-Duchatelet,\r\ncame to a close. Just as Parent-Duchatelet had inaugurated this kind of\r\ndescription, so the French now undertook the introduction of the further\r\nresearches into prostitution. First of all, Dr. J. Jeannel summarized\r\nthe results of the books we have already mentioned in a general work on\r\nprostitution,[270] which contained a comparative view of the conditions\r\nin various countries and towns. An Englishman, W. Acton, also wrote a\r\nsimilar general work on prostitution;[271] whilst yet another general\r\nwork on the subject was written by the German Hügel.[272]\r\n\r\nThe extremely important question of =secret= prostitution has been\r\nelucidated especially by the writings of Martineau[273] and\r\nCommenge;[274] the not less important question of prostitution practised\r\nby =girls under full age= is treated by Augagneur;[275] the =problems\r\nof regulation and of brothels= have been studied by Fiaux, whose work is\r\ncomprehensive and based upon carefully compiled statistics, and the\r\nauthor attempts the solution of these problems;[276] the sometime French\r\nMinister Yves Guyot has discussed the problem of prostitution from the\r\nhigher philosophical and social point of view;[277] in short, the French\r\nphysicians illuminated this obscure province of thought from every side,\r\nand =laid the foundations for the scientific and critical study of\r\nprostitution=, which began with the last decade of the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nTo Alfred Blaschko unquestionably belongs the credit of having broken\r\nentirely new ground in connexion with the problem of prostitution, by\r\nmeans of the debate instituted by him in the year 1892 in the Medical\r\nSociety of Berlin, and by several works distinguished by a\r\nsharp-sighted, critical faculty.[278] Upon his exhaustive scientific\r\nstudies, and upon the most careful practical considerations, Blaschko\r\nbases the demands:\r\n\r\n  “=Abolish Regulation!=\r\n   =Away with Brothels!=”\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Blaschko is a convinced advocate of the economic\r\ntheory of prostitution.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same time, Cesare Lombroso, the celebrated alienist and\r\ncriminal anthropologist of Turin, propounded his =anthropological=\r\ntheory of prostitution, and enunciated the doctrine, which attracted so\r\nmuch attention, of the “Donna delinquinte e prostituta,” of the\r\n“=congenital prostitute=.”[279] This doctrine found an unconditional\r\nsupporter in the St. Petersburg syphilologist Tarnowsky; whilst the\r\nlatter strongly opposed the efforts made by the International\r\nFederation, founded in 1875 by Mrs. Josephine Butler, for the abolition\r\nof the regulation of prostitution.[280] Ströhmberg, in an interesting\r\nwork on prostitution,[281] takes the same standpoint as Lombroso and\r\nTarnowsky.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, noteworthy that quite recently the French observers\r\nalso, and, above all, the experienced Fiaux, are inclining to the views\r\nof Blaschko, of the accuracy of which I myself am now fully convinced,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that in my work on prostitution in\r\nEngland,[282] which appeared eight years ago (October, 1900), I still\r\nadvocated regulation. E. von Düring also, who, as professor of medicine\r\nin Constantinople for many years, has made elaborate study of the\r\nconditions of prostitution in that town, adheres, in an essay well worth\r\nreading, without qualification to the opinion of Blaschko regarding the\r\nuselessness of regulation and of brothels.[283]\r\n\r\nAfter this brief enumeration of the most important descriptive and\r\nscientific studies of prostitution, we shall now proceed to a short\r\naccount of the conditions that obtain at the present day.\r\n\r\nThe idea of “=prostitution=” is in no respect clearly and sharply\r\nlimited. Parent-Duchatelet considered that prostitution only occurred\r\n\r\n  “when a woman was known to have accepted money for this purpose on\r\n  several successive occasions, when she was openly recognized as being\r\n  engaged in this occupation, when an arrest had occurred and the\r\n  offence had thus been definitely discovered, or when in any other way\r\n  it was proved to the satisfaction of the police” (vol. i., p. 11).\r\n\r\nBut in this way he entirely excluded the so-called “secret”\r\nprostitution--that is to say, he excluded by far the largest category of\r\nprostitution.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we take this latter into consideration, we find it necessary\r\nto have a wider conception of the term “prostitution.” This is\r\nrecognized by the French physician Rey in his little book on “=Public\r\nand Secret Prostitution=” (German edition, p. 1; Leipzig, 1851). He\r\nregards as prostitution the act “by which a woman allows the =use of her\r\nbody by any man, without distinction=, and =for a payment made or\r\nexpected=.”\r\n\r\nIn this admirable definition we see the two most important\r\ncharacteristics of prostitution: =complete indifference with regard to\r\nthe person of the man demanding the use of her body=, and the fact that\r\n=the act is done for reward=. The only point omitted from consideration\r\nis the condition mentioned by Parent-Duchatelet--namely, the =frequent\r\nrepetition= of the act of prostitution with =different= men.\r\n\r\nSchrank combines all these characteristics of prostitution in a much\r\nbriefer phrase, by defining them as “=professional acts of fornication\r\nperformed with the human body=,” by which, in the first place, we\r\ninclude male and female =homosexual= prostitution, which are not covered\r\nby the definitions previously quoted, and, in the second place,\r\nSchrank’s definition lays stress on the fact that in =genuine=\r\nprostitution the =monetary reward= is the aim of the act of prostitution\r\nmuch more than any kind of enjoyment. Where enjoyment plays a prominent\r\npart, =in addition to= the earning of money, we are no longer concerned\r\nwith genuine prostitution. Even a prostitute, who in other respects is\r\ntypically a woman of that class, ceases at that moment and for that time\r\nto be a prostitute, when her earnings become a secondary consideration,\r\nand the =man= to whom she gives herself the principal consideration.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, strictly speaking, a large proportion of secret\r\nprostitutes and numerous members of the half-world cannot be reckoned as\r\nprostitutes in the proper sense of the term--at any rate, =not always=;\r\nnot when, for instance, the man who supports and pays them is at the\r\nsame time their “lover”;[284] they then belong for the time being to the\r\nnot less dangerous province of “wild love.” But in practice this\r\ndistinction cannot be strictly maintained, for the =same= woman will\r\nvery frequently undertake a genuine act of prostitution.\r\n\r\nIt is only the “sale of the sweet name of love,” as the celebrated\r\npolitician Louis Blanc expresses it, which constitutes prostitution--the\r\n=complete lack= of all spiritual and all personal relationships on the\r\none side, and the ignominious predominance of the =mercantile= character\r\nof the sexual union on the other. Hence there may be prostitution in\r\nmarriage, although this always remains widely different from the sale of\r\nthe body to =numerous= and =frequently changing= individuals.\r\n\r\nThe “prostitution” of primeval times, in which social relationships were\r\nso utterly different from ours, unquestionably resembled rather the wild\r\nlove of the present day than our own prostitution. It was sexual\r\npromiscuity, not professional fornication. According to Heinrich\r\nSchurtz, prostitution is indeed not an exclusive product of higher\r\ncivilization, but occurs also among primitive peoples, and appears\r\neverywhere where the unrestricted sexual intercourse of youth--wild\r\nlove--is prevented, without early marriage taking its place. But what he\r\ndescribes as prostitution--for example, the living of several unmarried\r\ngirls in the houses of men--is still no more than a peculiar form of\r\nwild love. Still, according to the reports of numerous travellers, there\r\nare among primitive peoples also =purchasable= women, and this must be\r\nexplained, just as in our own case, from the combined influence of\r\nindividual, social, and economic conditions.\r\n\r\nTo my mind there is no doubt that the so-called “=religious=”\r\nprostitution is to be regarded as at least a =germinal form= and\r\n=predecessor= of the prostitution of the present day. In this case also\r\nwe had to do with =professional= fornication; only, although the\r\ntemple-girls, just like our modern prostitutes, gave themselves\r\n=indifferently to any man= that offered the money paid for this service,\r\nthat money did not, in the case of religious prostitution, go to the\r\ngirl herself, but to the deity, or to the crafty priests who represented\r\nhim; thus the priests really played the part of our modern\r\nbrothel-keepers. It is absolutely unquestionable that in this religious\r\nprostitution a more ideal element also played a part. This subject was\r\ndiscussed at considerable length above (pp. 100-112).\r\n\r\nProstitution is everywhere a product of the =growth of large towns=; its\r\npeculiar characteristics are developed only in large towns. To the\r\ncountry it was always foreign until those beautiful times of the middle\r\nages, in which prostitution was regarded as a =necessary of life=, like\r\neating and drinking, and was organized in guilds, so that everywhere\r\n“women-houses” were instituted for the public, unconstrained use of all\r\nclasses, for peasant and prince. At that time quite small towns also had\r\ntheir brothels. The appearance of syphilis, and the awakening of modern\r\nindividualism, brought these conditions to an end; the brothels\r\ndisappeared everywhere; and this tendency to a =continuous decrease= of\r\nbarrack prostitution, to a progressive diminution in the number of\r\nbrothels, has continually strengthened. On the whole, the rural\r\ndistricts to-day do not know prostitution; there we have only free love\r\nand wild love. The existence of prostitution is confined to the large\r\ntowns, because in these all the necessary conditions are fulfilled, and,\r\nabove all, because in large towns the possibilities for the\r\ngratification of the sexual impulse by marriage or by free love are in\r\nthe case of men much more limited than they are in the country. In the\r\ntown there is even a =demand= for prostitutes, but not in the country.\r\nIt is true that the demand on the part of men does not correspond to the\r\nextension which modern prostitution has assumed in the large towns; this\r\ndemand corresponds, as it were, to a portion only of prostitution. In\r\nhis admirable work on the campaign against prostitution (_Journal for\r\nthe Suppression of Venereal Diseases_, vol. ii., pp. 311-313) F.\r\nSchiller proves that prostitution has not increased merely in proportion\r\nto the increase in the male population, =but that in reality, in recent\r\ndecades, it has increased, on the whole, in a much greater proportion\r\nthan the population, and that different towns exhibit the most\r\nremarkable contrasts in the respective ratios of prostitutes to male\r\npopulation=.\r\n\r\nFor example, in Berlin prostitution has increased =to an extent almost\r\ndouble= that of the increase in male population. A similar relationship\r\nis to be observed in other large towns. Everywhere the supply of\r\nprostitutes =exceeds= the demand; and we cannot doubt that by this great\r\nsupply the need for prostitutes is to a large extent at first aroused.\r\nStreet-walkers and brothels =allure= many men to sexual intercourse who\r\notherwise would not have felt any need for it.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, the existence of a =voluntary demand= for\r\nprostitutes on the part of =men= is a fact which cannot be denied. In\r\nthis sense prostitution has been described as mainly a “man’s question.”\r\n\r\nHere we touch upon an extremely difficult problem, and one which, as far\r\nas I can see, no one before myself has definitely stated, perhaps\r\nbecause no one has =ventured= to do it--and yet, for our knowledge of\r\nprostitution, the question is one of great importance.\r\n\r\nWhat precisely is the “need of man for prostitution” of which Blaschko\r\nspeaks? Is it merely the sexual impulse? Or is there any other factor in\r\noperation?\r\n\r\nCertainly the sexual impulse, simple sensuality, plays a large part in\r\nthis male demand for prostitutes; but this does not explain the fact why\r\nmarried men, and so many men who, if not married, have yet opportunities\r\nfor other sexual intercourse, have recourse to prostitutes; it does not\r\nexplain the fact, by which I am myself continually and anew astonished,\r\nof the peculiar attractive force which prostitutes exercise upon\r\ncultured men with delicate æsthetic and ethical perceptions. Is there\r\nany deeper physiological relationship here involved?\r\n\r\nI answer this question unconditionally in the affirmative.\r\n\r\nIt is not by chance that prostitution is mainly a product of\r\ncivilization, that it finds in civilization its proper vital conditions,\r\nwhereas in primitive states it cannot properly thrive.\r\n\r\nIn primitive times, unrestrained by the (just) demands of a higher\r\ncivilization, and by the social morality intimately associated\r\ntherewith, men could, without fear or regret, satisfy their wild\r\nimpulses, no less in the sexual sphere than in others; they could\r\ngive free play to those peculiar biological instincts of a sexual\r\nnature which lie hidden in every man. Their sexual “supra- and\r\nsub-consciousness,” to use the happy phrase which Chr. von Ehrenfels\r\ninvented to denote the dualism of modern sexuality, were still\r\n=monistic=. To-day, however, the primitive instincts are =repressed= by\r\nthe necessities of civilized life, and by the coercive force of\r\nconventional morality; but these instincts still slumber in every one.\r\nEach one of us has also his sexual sub-consciousness. Sometimes it\r\nawakens, demands activity, free from all restraint, from all coercion,\r\nfrom all convention. In such moments it seems as if the man were an\r\nentirely different being. Here the “two souls” in our breast become a\r\nreality. Is this still the celebrated man of learning, the refined\r\nidealist, the sensitive æsthetic, the artist who has enriched us with\r\nthe most magnificent and the purest works of poetry or of plastic art?\r\nWe recognize him no longer, because in such moments something quite\r\ndifferent has awakened to life; =another= nature stirs within him and\r\nurges him with an elemental force to do things from which his\r\n“supra-consciousness,” the consciousness of the civilized man, would\r\ndraw back in horror.\r\n\r\nSuch a delicate sensitive nature, open to the finest spiritual\r\nactivities, as that of the Danish poet J. P. Jakobsen, must feel this\r\ncontrast in an especially painful manner; it is precisely such\r\nnatures--those in which the extremes we have described appear most\r\nsharply and most clearly--which afford us proof of the existence of a\r\ndouble consciousness. The primitive instinct breaks out, like a\r\nmonomania--of which old psychiatric doctrine of “monomania” we are\r\ninvoluntarily reminded when we see how even men of light and leading,\r\nmen who in other respects live only in the highest regions of the\r\nspirit, are subjected to the domination of this purely instinctive\r\nsexualism, so that they lead a “secret” inner life, of whose existence\r\nthe world has no suspicion.\r\n\r\nIn “Niels Lyhne” J. P. Jakobsen has admirably characterized this double\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n  “But when,” he writes, “he had served God truly for eleven days, it\r\n  often happened that =other powers= gained the upper hand in him; by an\r\n  overwhelming force he was driven to the coarse lust of coarse\r\n  enjoyments; he yielded, overcome by the human passion for\r\n  self-annihilation, which, while the blood burns as blood only can\r\n  burn, demands degradation, perversity, dirt, and foulness, with no\r\n  less force than the force which inspires the equally human passion for\r\n  becoming greater than one is, and purer.”\r\n\r\nThese human instincts can be satisfied only by prostitution. By the\r\npurchasable prostitute this desire, described so aptly and with so much\r\ninsight by Jakobsen, can be fully satisfied. To the origin of the desire\r\nwe shall return in another connexion. The common, the rough, the brutal\r\nanimal in the nature of prostitution, exercises a formal magical\r\nattractive force on large numbers of men.\r\n\r\nLudwig Pietsch, in his “Recollections of Sixty Years,” vol. ii., p. 337\r\n(Berlin, 1894), tells of the celebrated cocotte of the Second French\r\nEmpire, Cora Pearl, whom he saw in Baden-Baden:\r\n\r\n  “I have never been able to understand how it was that she exercised so\r\n  powerful an attraction. In her appearance, her tumid, painted\r\n  ‘pug-face,’ the secret was certainly not to be found. Perhaps the\r\n  influence which she exercised on so many men rested principally in the\r\n  quality which the royal friend of the Danish Countess Danner described\r\n  to the latter, when explaining to her the reason of the power, to\r\n  others quite incomprehensible, which Cora Pearl had exercised on his\r\n  own heart. He said: ‘=She is so gloriously vulgar=.’”\r\n\r\nThis word speaks volumes, and illuminates the peculiar influence of\r\nprostitutes and prostitution upon man in an apt and powerful way.[285]\r\n\r\nAdmirably, also, has Stefan Grimmen, in his novelette “Die Landpartie”\r\n(published in _Die Welt am Montag_, No. 22, May 28, 1906), described\r\nthis influence, which in this case was exercised by two demi-mondaines\r\nlying in the grass, upon the masculine members of a picnic-party, who\r\nwere so enthralled as completely to forget the ladies of their company.\r\nThe de Goncourts were also aware of the specific allurement exercised by\r\nprostitutes, for in one place in their diary they recommend a wife to\r\nadopt certain customs of prostitutes, in order to bind her husband to\r\nher for a long time.\r\n\r\nIn this respect, we cannot fail to recognize a certain masochistic trait\r\nin the sensibility of men, which appears especially remarkable when we\r\ncall to mind the contrast between the nature of the above described\r\nspiritually lofty persons and the nature of a prostitute. In this way we\r\nshould be led to the view that =prostitution is in part a product of the\r\nphysiological male masochism=--that is to say, of the impulse from time\r\nto time to plunge into the depths of coarse, brutal, sexual lust and of\r\nself-mortification and self-abasement, by surrender to a comparatively\r\nworthless creature. This attraction towards prostitutes is one of the\r\nmost remarkable phenomena in the psyche of the modern civilized man; it\r\nis the curse of the evolution of civilization.\r\n\r\n  “The most ideal man also is unable to free himself from his body,”\r\n  says Heinrich Schurtz; “refinement leads ultimately to an unnatural\r\n  over-nicety, =which must necessarily be permeated from time to time by\r\n  a breath of fresh unrefinement and coarse naturalism=, if it is not to\r\n  perish from its own inward contradiction.”\r\n\r\nIn a certain sense the same need finds expression also in Gutzkow’s\r\nremark in the “Neue Serapionsbrüder,” vol. i., p. 198 (Breslau, 1877),\r\nthat man sometimes has a need for “=woman-in-herself=,” not woman with\r\nthe thousand and one tricks and whimsies of wives, mothers, and\r\ndaughters.\r\n\r\nWithout question, this need is much more characteristic of man than of\r\nwoman. Still, I am not prepared altogether to deny its existence in the\r\nlatter. In another connexion I shall return to this extremely important\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nNaturally in this we see no more than a =favouring factor= of the\r\nappearance of prostitution =in the mass=; we do not speak of it as the\r\ndefinite cause of the production of any individual prostitute.\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, I consider the dispute regarding the causes of\r\nprostitution as superfluous; a number of causes are in operation, and in\r\neach individual case it is always an unfortunate =concatenation= of\r\ncircumstances, of subjective and objective influences, which have driven\r\nthe girl to prostitution. The various =theories= regarding the causes of\r\nprostitution have therefore only a relative value. Not one of them\r\nexplains it wholly; each explanation demands the assistance of others.\r\n\r\nThis is, above all, true of the celebrated theory of Lombroso, regarding\r\nthe “=born prostitute=,” a theory which states, to put the matter\r\nshortly and clearly, that the girl is born with all the =rudimentary\r\ncharacteristics= of a prostitute, and that these rudimentary\r\ncharacteristics have also a =physical= foundation, in the form of\r\ndemonstrable =stigmata of degeneration=.\r\n\r\nLombroso’s “born prostitute” is, above all, distinguished by a complete\r\nlack of the moral sense, by typical “moral insanity,” which is the true\r\n“=root=” of the prostitute life, for he regards that life as very little\r\ndependent upon the sexual. Prostitution, therefore, according to\r\nLombroso, “is only a special case of the early tendency to all evil, of\r\nthe desire which characterizes the morally idiotic human being from\r\nchildhood upwards, to do that which is forbidden.”[286] The individual\r\ncause of prostitution, according to this view, is to be found, not in\r\nthe sexual, but in the ethical province. With the ethical defects are\r\nassociated greediness, the love of finery, a tendency to drink, vanity,\r\ndislike of work, mendacity, and an inclination towards criminality. To\r\nthis moral degeneration there corresponds the presence of stigmata of\r\ndegeneration, such as anomalies of the teeth, cleft palate, abnormal\r\ndistribution of the hair, prominent ears, asymmetry of the face, etc.\r\n\r\nThe above-described type of degenerate woman does, as a fact, exist.\r\nBut, in the first place, such women constitute only a small fraction of\r\nprostitutes, and such women are found =following other occupations=.\r\nThus, the expression “born prostitute” is a false one; it should run,\r\n“born degenerate,” for not all born degenerates become prostitutes.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, =not all degenerate prostitutes are born\r\ndegenerates=. In many cases the degeneration is a result of the\r\nprofessional unchastity.\r\n\r\n  “No one,” says Friedrich Hammer, “who has not personally investigated\r\n  the matter can conceive how =rapidly= and =completely= the =process of\r\n  transformation from an honourable girl into a prostitute\r\n  proceeds=--the transformation into a street-walker. A few weeks before\r\n  she was clean-looking and trim, perhaps with a somewhat frivolous\r\n  appearance, but still able to understand the position in which she\r\n  found herself; now, however, she seems to have completely ‘gone to\r\n  pieces’; she is dirty and verminous, and on her face is an expression\r\n  of absolute wretchedness, not, as you perhaps might imagine, of\r\n  unbridled sensuality--=no, rather one of indifference=, of complete\r\n  helplessness and loss of will, of unresponsiveness alike to punishment\r\n  and to benefit.”[287]\r\n\r\nThe earlier investigators of prostitution, including the first of all,\r\nParent-Duchatelet, did not fail to recognize that the mental and\r\nphysical abnormalities of the prostitute were =changes= due to her mode\r\nof life. In many prostitutes we can observe a =typical obliteration of\r\nthe secondary and tertiary sexual characters= after a prolonged practice\r\nof their profession. Virey remarked, very justly, that “in consequence\r\nof the frequent embraces of men, prostitutes gain a more or less\r\nmasculine appearance”: their neck is thicker, their voice harsher and\r\nmore masculine (J. J. Virey, “Woman,” pp. 157, 158; Leipzig, 1827).\r\n\r\nMost prostitutes have done more or less injury to the functions of the\r\nhuman body, have completely disordered their sexual life, and are\r\nsterile. It is not to be wondered at that this sometimes manifests\r\nitself in their outward appearance--as, for example, in the slight\r\ndevelopment of the breasts, which often amounts to a simple atrophy. The\r\n“unmistakable development” of the tertiary characters of the male in\r\nindividual prostitutes, which has led Kurella to propound the\r\ninteresting hypothesis that prostitutes are a sub-variety of the\r\nhomosexual,[288] rests for the most part upon their assumption of a\r\nmasculine mode of life and masculine habits, which in the long-run\r\ncannot fail to influence also the bodily development--as, for example,\r\nsmoking and the excessive use of alcohol, pot-house life, gluttony, and\r\nother masculine habits. The “deep masculine voice” of many prostitutes\r\nis unquestionably in most cases the result of the excessive use of\r\ntobacco and alcohol. To this striking =gradual= change in the voice\r\nParent-Duchatelet devoted considerable attention (vol. i., pp. 86-88, of\r\nthe German edition); it also attracted Lippert’s notice.\r\nParent-Duchatelet refers the common development in prostitutes of the\r\nmasculine voice to their excessive indulgence in alcoholic beverages,\r\nand to their exposure to frequent changes of weather (catching cold,\r\netc.). Smoking also certainly plays a part.\r\n\r\nLippert draws attention to other changes (“Prostitution in Hamburg,” pp.\r\n80 and 90):\r\n\r\n  “By the daily practice of their profession for many years their eyes\r\n  acquire a piercing, rolling expression; they are somewhat unduly\r\n  prominent in consequence of the continued tension of the ocular\r\n  muscles, since the eyes are principally employed to spy out and\r\n  attract clients. In many the organs of mastication are strongly\r\n  developed; the mouth, in continuous activity either in eating or in\r\n  kissing, is conspicuous; the forehead is often flat; the occipital\r\n  region is at times extremely prominent; the hair of the head is often\r\n  scanty--in fact, a good many become actually bald. For this reasons\r\n  are not lacking: above all, the restless mode of life; the continued\r\n  running about in all weathers in the open street, sometimes with the\r\n  head bare; the often long-lasting fluor albus from which they\r\n  suffer;[289] the incessant brushing, manipulation, frizzling, and\r\n  pomading of the hair; and, among the lower classes of prostitutes, the\r\n  use of brandy.\r\n\r\n  “The rough voice is the physiological characteristic of the woman who\r\n  has lost her proper functions--those of the mother.”\r\n\r\nHowever, the =majority= of =youthful prostitutes= exhibit purely\r\n=feminine= characteristics; it is only late in life that the\r\nabove-described type becomes predominant, and this shows us that the\r\nmasculine characteristics are the result of =objective= influences. From\r\nfive to ten years bring about a notable difference. In the year 1898 I\r\ntreated a maidservant for syphilis. At that time she was of an elegant,\r\ngenuinely feminine appearance. Seven years later, in the year 1905, I\r\nsaw her once more. What a change! Her face was bloated and widened; her\r\neyes, once so bright and clear, had become cloudy and expressionless;\r\nher voice was rough; all the specific feminine forms and characters had\r\nbeen obliterated by extreme corpulence. It was no longer a woman, it was\r\na “prostitute,” a special type of humanity, but one which had been\r\n=gradually produced=, and as a result of no more than six years of the\r\npractice of professional prostitution.\r\n\r\nThese facts do not by any means exclude the existence of =genuine\r\ndegenerates= among prostitutes in a greater percentage than among\r\nnon-prostitutes;[290] nor do they exclude the existence of genuine\r\nhomosexuals among prostitutes. To this extent Lombroso’s theory contains\r\na nucleus of truth; but it concerns only a fraction of the entire world\r\nof prostitutes. Lombroso has himself been repeatedly compelled to\r\nrecognize the frequency with which he has encountered among prostitutes\r\nwomen of normal appearance, and even beautiful women.[291]\r\n\r\nFinally, the doctrine of the “born prostitute” is contradicted by the\r\nfact that the same types of degenerate which are described by Lombroso\r\namong prostitutes are found also among women who are not\r\nprostitutes.[292] In fact, Lombroso has been led to this view by the\r\nrecognition of an “equivalent of prostitutes among the upper classes”;\r\nbut in this way he has only proved that the =same= moral degeneration\r\nthat is encountered in a certain proportion of prostitutes is also seen\r\nin misconducted women of other and higher classes. There are, in fact,\r\nprostitute natures among the “upper ten thousand.”\r\n\r\nThe best limitation of the general value of the doctrine of the “born\r\nprostitute” is the concluding chapter of Lombroso’s book upon\r\n“Occasional Prostitutes.” He begins with the pertinent remark:\r\n\r\n  “Not all prostitutes are ethically indifferent--that is to say, they\r\n  are =not all born prostitutes=; in this province =opportunity= also\r\n  plays its part.”\r\n\r\nLombroso proceeds to develop this thesis, thus markedly limiting the\r\napplication of his own theory, and recognizing that, in addition to\r\nnatural predisposition, quite other causes and influences come into play\r\nin the production of prostitution.\r\n\r\nAbove all, the =economic= factors are of greater importance in the\r\ngenesis and growth of prostitution, even though their influence is not\r\nan exclusive one.\r\n\r\nI distinguish here between =real, genuine poverty= (lack of food, proper\r\nhousing accommodation, etc.) and merely =relative poverty=. Hitherto, in\r\nconsidering the economic causes of prostitution, these two elements have\r\nnot been distinguished with sufficient clearness.\r\n\r\n=The fact that real, absolute poverty and lack of the necessaries of\r\nlife drives many girls to a life of prostitution can, in view of recent\r\nstatistical data, no longer be disputed.= More exact material dealing\r\nwith this subject is to be found in the above mentioned writings of\r\nBlaschko, one of the principal advocates of the economic theory of\r\nprostitution; also in the works of Georg Keben,[293] Oda Olberg,[294]\r\nAnna Pappritz,[295] Pfeiffer,[296] Paul Kampffmeyer,[297] E. von\r\nDüring,[298] and many others. Here we have a superabundant material, a\r\nquantity of distressing and tragical individual data and proofs of\r\nGutzkow’s thesis, that =the material evils of society always and\r\neverywhere undergo transformation into immorality=. Here unquestionably\r\nmust we =first= apply the lever for the removal of this economic\r\npredisposing condition of prostitution. _Hic Rhodus, hic salta!_ I am\r\nmyself firmly convinced of this fact, although I do =not= consider that\r\nthe causes of prostitution are to be found =exclusively= in economic\r\nconditions--an opinion which Anna Pappritz, for example, maintains in\r\nthe most extreme form. It is quite true, however, that our entire sexual\r\nlife at the present day is so intimately connected with the =social\r\nquestion= that the reform of the sexual life demands as an unconditional\r\npreliminary a reform of economic conditions. Prostitution =on the large\r\nscale=, as it manifests itself in modern days, and its =continuous\r\nincrease= to an extent quite unparalleled in former times, is only\r\nexplicable by the rapid transformation of economic conditions--as, for\r\nexample, by the concentration of population in large towns, by the\r\nindustrial revolution, and by the development of great aggregations of\r\ncapital, by the consequent greatly increased severity of the struggle\r\nfor existence, the postponement of marriage, and the ever-increasing\r\nnumber of individuals who are not economically and professionally\r\nindependent. The increase in =child-labour= (naturally we refer\r\nespecially to children of the female sex) has also to be considered as a\r\nremarkable phenomenon of modern industrial life; but, above all, we must\r\ntake into account the fact that =woman’s work= is on the average\r\nregarded at a very low valuation, and is paid accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe insufficiency of their earnings is the immediate cause of the fact\r\nthat so many women and girls seek =accessory earnings= in the form of\r\nprostitution. It is well known that employers reckon on this fact in\r\ndrawing up their pay-lists, and frequently are so brutally cynical as to\r\npoint out to their female employees the possibility of increasing their\r\nearnings in this manner--one very convenient to the employer!\r\n\r\nThe _Reichsarbeitsblatt_, No. 2, of the year 1903, publishes a very\r\nremarkable account of the conditions of work and life of the =unmarried\r\nfemale factory employees= in Berlin. It is based upon the reports of the\r\nprofessional factory inspectors in Berlin, who have access to material\r\naffording them accurate information regarding the mode of life of\r\nfactory women. The reports concern 939 unmarried factory hands, and\r\ninclude all occupations in which in Berlin a considerable number of\r\nwomen were employed. The average age of the women who came under\r\nobservation was 22-1/2 years; the oldest was 54 years; 53·5 % of the\r\nwhole number were over 21 years of age; 42 % were between 16 and 21\r\nyears of age; 4·5 % were below 16 years of age. The average number of\r\nhours of daily work was 9-1/2; 3·2 % of all the women worked from 7-1/2\r\nto 8 hours; 37·2 %, 8 to 9 hours; 47·7 %, 9 to 10 hours; and 11·9 %, 10\r\nto 11 hours. The weekly wage amounted on the average to 11·36 marks\r\n(shillings); individually, the wages were very variable; 4·3 % of the\r\nwomen were paid less than 6 marks (shillings); 1·1 % were paid from 20\r\nto 30 marks (shillings). =In a very large majority of instances the\r\nwages varied between 8 and 15 marks.= Supplies from a source independent\r\nof their wages, in the form of money, clothing, and means of\r\nsubsistence, were received, according to their own statement, by 88 of\r\nthe women; among these, 41 were assisted by parents, 4 by other\r\nrelatives, 3 in other ways; 542 of those examined lived with their\r\nparents, 57 with other relatives--that is, altogether 64·2 of the total\r\nnumber--21·5 % lived in common lodging-houses, 14 % in their own rooms.\r\nThe worst-paid workwomen lived chiefly with their parents; as soon as\r\nthe wage sufficed to support them away from home a great many left their\r\nparents’ houses. The housing accommodation was ascertained in 846\r\ninstances; in 758 of these a single room constituted the dwelling, in 82\r\ncases a kitchen, in 2 cases an attic, in 3 some other room. In isolated\r\ncases quite unsuitable places were used to sleep in. =Speaking\r\ngenerally, the conditions were worse= than appears from the above\r\nfigures. Of 832 workwomen, only 169 had a room to themselves; 193 slept\r\nin a room with one other person, and 470--that is, 56·6 %--=with several\r\npersons=. With regard to the cost of their dwellings, there were 464\r\nreports; the average payment was 1·79 marks (shillings) per week. The\r\ncost of the food (dinner and lesser meals) amounted on the average, in\r\nthe case of 568, to 6·77 marks (shillings); of these, 205 paid less than\r\n6 marks (shillings), 109 more than 8 marks (shillings) per week. The\r\ntotal cost for lodging and food amounted in the case of 867 workwomen on\r\nthe average to 7·62 marks; 44·7 % had their principal meal at midday;\r\n55·3 % in the evening; 79·4 % took it at home; 9·4 % in the factory;\r\n11·2 % in a public kitchen, a cooking-school, or an eating-house. With\r\nregard to the expenditure for clothing, etc., =very scanty= details were\r\nobtained--too scanty to be worth recording. Of the 939 workwomen of whom\r\ninquiry was made on the point, 197, or 21 %, contributed money to the\r\neducation or support of relatives or children; about 10 % paid (direct)\r\ntaxes, with a mean expenditure of 8 pfennige (one penny) per week. For\r\namusement, 233 women recorded an average weekly expenditure of 1 mark\r\n(shilling). To a considerable number of those examined it was possible\r\nto put a little money by; in most cases the amount averaged from half to\r\none mark (sixpence to one shilling) per week; in many cases, however,\r\nthe money saved =was spent at some other time during the year=, in\r\nconsequence of diminished earnings or illness. The figures obtained,\r\nalthough in many cases they require further examination, elaboration,\r\nand illustration, still suffice to show that much remains to be done for\r\nthe improvement of the conditions of life of female factory employees.\r\n\r\nThat these wages are quite insufficient is shown by the following table\r\nof the daily expenditure of a sempstress for food and lodging (based on\r\nthe reports of von Stülpnagel):\r\n\r\n                              Mk.  Pf.\r\n  Bedroom and coffee          0    20\r\n  Second breakfast            0    15\r\n  Dinner (midday)             0    30\r\n  Afternoon tea               0    15\r\n  Supper                      0    20\r\n  Two bottles of beer         0    20\r\n                              -------\r\n                       Total  1    20\r\n\r\nThat amounts per week to 8 marks 40 pfennige (eight shillings and\r\nfivepence) for board-lodging. For the rest, clothing, washing, and a\r\nlittle amusement, have to be provided for, and this is only possible in\r\nthe case of the highest wages, varying from 12 to 15 marks; but this\r\nhigher wage =often enough= suffices, as Anna Pappritz herself admits. In\r\nmany cases the weekly wage is only 5 to 8 marks. In the majority of\r\noccupations connected with the manufacture of ready-made clothing, trade\r\nis only brisk for four to six months in each year. Thus, there is\r\nnecessarily a great deal of unemployment.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Statistical Annual for the town of Berlin for the year\r\n1907, the =annual wages= amounted:\r\n\r\n  For tailoresses                    to  457  marks\r\n   „  sempstresses                    „  486    „\r\n   „  hand buttonhole workers         „  354    „\r\n   „  machine buttonhole workers      „  700    „\r\n   „  other women factory employees   „  354    „\r\n\r\nAccording to the report of the Statistical Bureau, the average yearly\r\nincome of women factory employees throughout the German Empire was only\r\n322 marks!\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, no matter for surprise that the industrial councillors\r\nof Frankfurt-on-the-Main and of Wiesbaden, in their published reports on\r\nthe wages of female factory employees for the year 1887, state:\r\n\r\n  “In Frankfurt, at the end of last month, among 226 persons under the\r\n  observation of the _police des mœurs_ (that is, not reckoning secret\r\n  prostitution), 98 were female factory employees. Since for their\r\n  necessary bare support (food and sleeping accommodation only), the\r\n  minimum daily sum needed is 1·25 marks, it appears that the wages\r\n  which can be earned by female employees of 1·50 to 1·80 marks can\r\n  hardly suffice to provide for all their needs. It would seem,\r\n  therefore, that the lowness of their earnings must play some part in\r\n  the matter under discussion.”\r\n\r\nThe reports of the industrial councillors of Düsseldorf, Posen, Stettin,\r\nNeuss, Barmen, Elberfeld, Gladbach, Erfurt, etc., have a similar\r\nsignification.\r\n\r\nImportant in relation to the incontrovertible connexion between material\r\npoverty and prostitution is the fact that in the majority of cases the\r\nprostitution of female factory employees is only =occasional=, and not\r\nprofessional prostitution--that is to say, such women have recourse to\r\nprostitution only when compelled thereto by deficient means.\r\n\r\nAs regards genuine =professional= prostitution, female factory\r\nemployees, who live in a state of comparative freedom, contribute a\r\nsmaller contingent of recruits than =maidservants=, whose position is\r\nalways a =more dependent= one, and who are much less experienced in the\r\nstruggle for existence, although, generally speaking, they live in\r\nbetter conditions. From a computation based upon figures for the years\r\n1855, 1873, and 1898 (those for 1855 and 1898 relating to far too small\r\na number of cases), Blaschko derives the opinion that formerly female\r\nfactory employees provided a greater number of recruits to prostitution\r\nthan they do at present; but that, on the contrary, the contribution of\r\nmaidservants to the ranks of professional prostitution has enormously\r\nincreased. This assertion cannot pass without contradiction.\r\nGross-Hoffinger, in the work previously mentioned, pointed out that the\r\nclass of maidservants was the true nucleus of prostitution, and devoted\r\nto this fact a long and illuminating chapter of his book. And at about\r\nthe same time (1848) Lippert also wrote (_op. cit._, p. 79): “The\r\nprincipal sources of prostitution are =maidservants=, sempstresses,\r\nflower-girls, tailoresses, hairdressers, shop-girls, and barmaids.”\r\n(Gross-Hoffinger himself emphasizes the word “=maidservants=.”)\r\n\r\nWe see, therefore, that the preponderance of ex-maidservants in the\r\nranks of professional prostitution is by no means a new phenomenon,\r\nalthough, possibly, that preponderance is even =greater= now than it was\r\nin former times. And though in isolated instances it may happen that\r\nsimple poverty forces a maidservant to become a prostitute, this\r\nexplanation does not suffice for the generality of cases. The same\r\nreservation must be made in respect of seduction and illegitimate\r\nmotherhood as causes of prostitution. And in so far as poverty is a\r\ncause, we must speak rather of =relative= poverty, poverty which has\r\nmore of a subjective than an objective character.\r\n\r\nSchiller rightly remarks, in his admirable essay on the “Prevention of\r\nProstitution,” that in respect of prostitutes who have been\r\nmaidservants, in the majority of cases there can be no question of\r\ninsufficient wages and actual poverty (if we except the badly paid\r\nservants in public-houses, laundry-maids, and a few others), since the\r\nmaidservant receives, in addition to her wages, free board and lodging,\r\nand therefore is in a much better position than the majority of female\r\nfactory employees and of women engaged in home industries.\r\nNotwithstanding this, maidservants supply the largest proportion of\r\nprostitutes.\r\n\r\nThe majority of maidservants come from the country, where lax views\r\nprevail regarding sexual relationships. In addition, girls usually come\r\nto town when still very young. The want of education and experience of\r\nlife is, in their case, very striking; and this is increased by their\r\npermanently dependent position, in contrast with the early independence\r\nof the town factory-women, who are speedily initiated into all the\r\npossible evils of town life. In addition, there comes into the question\r\nan influence which hitherto has been underestimated: the =love of\r\nfinery=. Among maidservants this is especially powerful, since, in this\r\nrespect, they are continually exposed to suggestive influences, arising\r\nfrom the clothing of their mistresses. This love of dress, in\r\nassociation with a far greater unscrupulousness in sexual matters than\r\nexists among workwomen, drives many servant-girls, even =without= real\r\npoverty, to prostitution. After they have lost their place, after they\r\nhave acquired a distaste for work, have given birth to an illegitimate\r\nchild, or have been infected with venereal disease, they very readily\r\nenter the ranks of professional prostitution.\r\n\r\nThis =subjective psychological= factor plays nearly as great a rôle as\r\nthe economic factor. Blaschko himself draws attention to the fact that,\r\nin proportion to the hundreds of thousands of women who are compelled to\r\nearn their bread by hard, badly paid toil, the number of those who\r\nultimately become prostitutes is really almost infinitesimally small;\r\nand that, therefore, we must regard as accessory causes of prostitution,\r\ndefective will-power, want of industry, of perseverance, and\r\nof moral instincts, and, finally, also--and here Lombroso is\r\njustified--congenital deficiency. Hellpach is right when, in his most\r\nreadable essay on “Prostitution and Prostitutes” (Berlin, 1905), he lays\r\nthe principal stress on this “social-psychological” explanation of\r\nprostitution, and regards the purely economic factor as “the ultimate\r\nturning-point” in the fatal road that leads to prostitution. (Earlier\r\nthan Hellpach, Anton Baumgarten attempted to give a social-psychological\r\nexplanation of prostitution. See his essays, containing much valuable\r\nmaterial, “Police and Prostitution,” and “The Relations of Prostitution\r\nto Crime,” published in the eighth and eleventh volumes respectively of\r\nthe “Archives of Criminal Anthropology.”)\r\n\r\nWe must, therefore, hold firmly to the fact that the most =diverse= and\r\n=heterogeneous= vital conditions may ultimately lead to prostitution.\r\nAmong these, =lack of education=, =premature habituation= to sexual\r\ndepravation by =casual observation= and by =deliberate seduction=, play\r\nan important rôle. And these causes are themselves to a large extent\r\nsecondary to the =miserable housing conditions= in great towns, recently\r\nso dramatically described by von Pfeiffer and Kampffmeyer.\r\n\r\n  “It is easier,” says Pfeiffer, “to thunder against immorality from the\r\n  top of a lofty tower, than it is to resist every allurement in dull,\r\n  narrow dwellings, in the midst of poverty and deprivation.... The\r\n  lodger flirts with the wife; the married or free-loving pair, also\r\n  living in the house, do not wait to begin their caresses until the\r\n  children are out of the way. The children are witnesses of many scenes\r\n  which are little adapted to the preservation of pure morals; they see\r\n  things which they later come to regard as matters of course, and when\r\n  they have the opportunity they act in the same way themselves, for\r\n  they have not learned otherwise, and they think that every one does\r\n  the same....\r\n\r\n  “The servant-girl becomes pregnant; no one knows what has become of\r\n  her child’s father. Driven out of her place, she remembers that she\r\n  has a married sister, and after long search she finds her in a damp\r\n  basement dwelling. This dwelling consists of a single room and a dark\r\n  kitchen; three shivering, dirty children are playing on the floor; the\r\n  husband is out of employment; but still they can find room for this\r\n  sister-in-law and her illegitimate child. Then perhaps there are\r\n  better days for a time. But within the narrow limits of the one-roomed\r\n  dwelling the association is too intimate, and the sister-in-law again\r\n  becomes pregnant, and ultimately in the same week both the sisters are\r\n  delivered as the result of impregnation by the same man. When we think\r\n  how all this has taken place in the =only= available room, we can\r\n  understand that the children must have seen a great deal little suited\r\n  to childish eyes.”\r\n\r\nThe housing statistics of Berlin for the year 1900 give horrible reports\r\nregarding this, and even much worse conditions--conditions which are\r\nsufficiently explained when we consider how often families living in a\r\nsingle room take in a =male= or a =female lodger= for the night.\r\nOne-roomed dwellings in which from four to seven sleep every night are\r\ncommon; those in which eight to ten sleep are by no means rare!\r\n\r\nAfter what has been said above, no elaborate demonstration is needed to\r\nshow that =alcoholism= everywhere, in the most diverse conditions,\r\nprepares the soil for prostitution. Kräpelin and O. Rosenthal have\r\nthoroughly exposed this intimate connexion between prostitution and\r\nalcoholism.\r\n\r\nAn even more important source of prostitution is to be found in\r\n=procurement= and in the =traffic in girls=--this grave social evil of\r\nour time. How often are children initiated into the practice of\r\nprostitution, for the sake of pecuniary gain, by their own parents, or\r\nby some other individual devoid of all moral feeling, and taught to\r\nserve as mere instruments of earning money by lust! Paris offers more\r\nexamples of this traffic than any other European city, but London is not\r\nfar behind, as was proved by the _Pall Mall Gazette_ scandals of 1883,\r\nto which we shall return in another connexion. In Berlin itself in\r\nrecent years the number of half-grown, and even childish, prostitutes\r\nhas enormously increased. Prostitutes from thirteen to fourteen years of\r\nage are no longer rare.\r\n\r\nAn even sadder phenomenon is the modern =traffic in girls=, a\r\ncharacteristic product of the age of commerce, although earlier times\r\nwere, indeed, familiar with it, especially France in the eighteenth\r\ncentury,[299] witness more especially the accounts of the celebrated\r\n_Parc-aux-Cerfs_.\r\n\r\nThe modern traffic in girls[300] is intimately connected with the\r\n=brothel question=. We can, in fact, assert that if there were no\r\nbrothels there would be no traffic in girls. This is proved also by the\r\n=growing dislike= to brothels felt by prostitutes, who prefer a free\r\nlife. For this reason, it becomes more and more difficult for the\r\nkeepers of brothels to obtain inmates, and the international traffic in\r\ngirls attempts to fill the continually increasing deficiency in the\r\nnumber of girls entering brothels.\r\n\r\nThe traffic in girls is to-day almost exclusively recruited from Eastern\r\nEurope. As regards its original sources, we find that Galicia--_i.e._,\r\nAustrian Poland--supplies 40 %, Russia 15 %, Italy 11 %, Austria-Hungary\r\n10 %, Germany 8 %, of the “White Slave Trade.” Most of the girls are\r\ntransported to the Argentine, where we find them in the brothels.[301]\r\n\r\nThe traders in girls, or “kaften” as they are called in Brazil, are, for\r\nthe most part, Polish Jews. Rosenack shows, in his report on the\r\ncampaign against the traffic in girls (a campaign actively taken up by\r\nthe Western European Jewish Unions, and especially by the Jewish\r\nAssociation for the Protection of Girls and Women), that five out of six\r\nof the Galician Jews engaged in this traffic are what are called\r\n“Luftmenschen” (men of air)--that is, men without any definite or secure\r\nmeans of livelihood--and that only an improvement in their social\r\nconditions can put an end to the traffic in girls. As regards that part\r\nof the world, he considers that the measures resolved upon by the\r\n=National= and =International Conference for the Suppression of the\r\nTraffic in Girls= (Berlin, 1903; Frankfurt-on-the-Main, 1905) are not\r\nadapted to offer any important hindrances to the traffic. More effective\r\nhas been the work of the Jewish Branch Committee in Germany for the\r\nsuppression of the Galician traffic in girls. Dr. Rosenack, Berta\r\nPappenheim, and Dr. Sera Rabinowitsch, in furtherance of the work of the\r\ncommittee, studied the local conditions; the population was instructed\r\nverbally and by leaflets and pamphlets. Endeavours have been made to\r\nimprove the economic condition of the workwomen of Galicia. For this\r\npurpose, instructed female assistants are sent from Germany to Galicia.\r\nIt has been possible to awaken in Galicia general interest in the work\r\nof the suppression of traffic in girls. In a Conference held at Lemberg,\r\nthe Galician clubs and Jewish committees made representations to German\r\nand other societies, in order to formulate a plan, and to devise\r\nmeasures for the improvement of Galician conditions.\r\n\r\nIn Buenos Ayres, the principal town of entry for Galician girls, a\r\ncommittee has been formed to oppose the traffic in girls, the members of\r\nthis committee being of all religions and nationalities. This has had\r\none good effect--that the traders in girls have become alarmed; they no\r\nlonger practise their profession so openly as before. The Argentine\r\npolice are also taking an active part in the fight with the traffic. Not\r\nmore than two of the judges at Buenos Ayres were found to make common\r\ncause with the “traders,” and to discharge them on receipt of large\r\nbribes. A law has been drafted for the punishment of those engaged in\r\nthis traffic, by imprisonment for six years and confiscation of their\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nThe traders in girls constitute an international ring, and the centre of\r\ntheir organization is in Buenos Ayres.\r\n\r\nIn Berlin, since 1904, there has existed a =central police organization=\r\nfor the suppression of the international traffic in girls, the activity\r\nof which extends throughout the Empire. Every case of this traffic which\r\ncomes to the notice of the police in Germany is reported to the central\r\npolice organization. This draws up a list of all the traders in girls\r\nwhose names are definitely known. It has started an album containing\r\nphotographs of traders who have been punished, and it exchanges\r\nexperiences with the police of other countries. It is to be hoped that\r\nin comparison with the other countries of Europe the number of German\r\ngirls exported to brothels abroad will continually grow smaller, and\r\nthat the local measures undertaken in Galicia and the Argentine will\r\nhave a good effect in limiting, and ultimately suppressing, this\r\ntraffic.\r\n\r\nHenne am Rhyn has shown that to and from other countries--for example,\r\nfrom England to Belgium and Germany (Hamburg), from Galicia to Turkey,\r\nfrom Italy to North America, etc.--individual girls are transported.\r\nAccording to Felix Baumann, the number of traders in girls in New York\r\napproaches 20,000. They have close relations to the police, and they\r\nemploy young handsome men, called “cadets,” to attract the girls. The\r\nabolition of brothels would here also be the best means of abolishing\r\nthe traffic in girls.\r\n\r\nHaving now learned the sources of prostitution, we must proceed to give\r\na brief account of the places in which it is carried on. Here we have\r\nfirst of all to distinguish =public= from =secret= prostitution.\r\n\r\nAs regards public prostitution, there are only =two= principal varieties\r\nto consider: street prostitution, where the women seek their victims in\r\nthe streets, in order to carry them off either to their =own dwellings=\r\nor to =houses of accommodation=; and =brothel prostitution=. At the\r\npresent day in most countries public street prostitution is far the most\r\ngeneral form, and this is especially true as regards Germany, where in a\r\nfew towns only brothels continue to exist. In many places this street\r\nprostitution--for example, in the Friedrichstrasse of Berlin, and also\r\non the boulevards of Paris--gives rise to conditions which recall the\r\nworst days of imperial Rome. The =contact= between public life and\r\nprofessional prostitution is unquestionably a great evil. The activity\r\nof prostitutes in the open streets, the shameless and lascivious display\r\nof their sexual charms, their bold solicitation _coram publico_, the\r\nstimulating character of professional unchastity--all these poison our\r\npublic life, obliterate the boundary between cleanliness and\r\ncontamination, and display daily a picture of sexual corruption--alike\r\nbefore the eyes of the pure, blameless girl, those of the honourable\r\nwife, and those of the immature boy. Aptly has this =street=\r\nprostitution been termed the _cloaca_ of our social life, which empties\r\ninto the open street, whereas at least =brothel= prostitution only\r\nrepresented a hidden _cloaca_, whose offensive odour need not annoy all\r\nthe world, as inevitably happens in the case of street prostitution. In\r\naddition, we have to consider the serious dangers involved in the\r\npractice of professional fornication in private dwellings and houses of\r\naccommodation, as they involve the decent families living in such\r\nhouses. What do the children living in such houses see and hear?\r\nFrequently prostitutes are admitted to confidential family intercourse,\r\nand they seduce the daughters of poor people to join them in the\r\npractice of prostitution, and the sons to a vicious life or to become\r\nsouteneurs. That the danger of contamination of the lower classes of the\r\npopulation by means of prostitution is by no means imaginary, is clearly\r\nshown by numerous examples from actual life. I subscribe to all that the\r\nadvocates of brothels say in this respect.\r\n\r\nAnd yet =brothels= are a =still= greater evil! They constitute an\r\nincomparably =more dangerous= centre of =sexual corruption=, a worse\r\n=breeding-ground of sexual aberrations= of every kind, and last, not\r\nleast, the =greatest focus of sexual infection=. With reference to the\r\nlast point, the matter will be discussed more fully in the chapter\r\ndealing with the question of regulation in connexion with the\r\nsuppression of venereal diseases.\r\n\r\nThe brothel is the =high-school= of refined sexual lust and perversity.\r\nThe detailed proof of this I must leave to the descriptions of the two\r\nwriters most experienced in the life of brothels, Léo Taxil[302] and\r\nLouis Fiaux.[303]\r\n\r\nIt is a fact well known to all that many young men learn in brothels for\r\nthe first time the manifold and artificial ways in which natural sexual\r\nintercourse can be replaced by perverse methods of sexual activity.\r\n=Here, in the brothel, psychopathia sexualis is systematically taught.=\r\nAnd what the old debauchee demands from the prostitute and pays her for,\r\nperverse intercourse, is =spontaneously offered to the youthful\r\ninitiate=, because competition between the prostitutes, and the hope of\r\na higher payment, lead them to do so. The opinion of the French authors\r\njust mentioned is perfectly credible--that there are young men who in\r\nthis way have learned about perverse sexuality =before= they were fully\r\nacquainted with natural sexuality, and who thus have permanently\r\nacquired more inclination for these mysteries of Venus than for a\r\nnatural and normal sexual intercourse.\r\n\r\n“=Brothel-jargon=,” or “=brothel-slang=,” contains a number of words\r\nalmost peculiar to this dialect, by which the contra-natural, abnormal\r\nmethods of sexual intercourse are denoted in a more or less cynical\r\nmanner; for example, _faire feuille de rose_ = anilinctus; _sfogliar la\r\nrosa_ (to pluck the leaves from the rose) = pædicare; _faire tête-bêche_\r\n= reciprocal cunnilinctus of two tribades; _punta di penna_ =\r\nmasturbatio labialis; _pulci lavoratrici_ (learned fleas!) = tribades,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nA learned investigator like Fiaux is led by his observations of many\r\nyears to the conclusion that =brothels= constitute not only the most\r\n=dangerous= form of public prostitution, but the most dangerous kind of\r\nprostitution that exists at all, and that it is urgently necessary that\r\nthey should be abolished in all countries as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the two varieties and localities of “public”\r\nprostitution--that is, prostitution carried on under the observation of\r\nthe police--there is a much more extensive =secret= prostitution, in\r\nconnexion with which, however, the word “secret” must always be accepted\r\nwith reserve, since in its case also it comes more or less under the eye\r\nof the public. This secret prostitution is, for example, accessible at\r\nnumerous places, and these are very different one from another. Secret\r\nprostitution also has its types, its peculiarities--in short, its\r\ndefinite local colouring, according to the place in which it is\r\npractised. Let us give a brief account of the various localities of\r\nsecret prostitution.\r\n\r\n1. =Public-houses with Women Attendants, the so-called\r\n“Animierkneipen.”=--The =waitress= (barmaid) is the true exemplar of the\r\nsecret prostitute, and further, in consequence of the perpetual\r\nassociation with alcoholism, is the most dangerous variety;[304] for the\r\nbarmaid allures the guest even more to the excessive consumption of\r\nalcohol than to sexual indulgence. For this purpose barmaids receive a\r\npercentage of the receipts from the sale of liquor, and this sum, in\r\naddition to free board, is their only wage.\r\n\r\nThe “animierkneipen”[305] and the restaurants with women attendants can\r\nbe plainly distinguished from a considerable distance by their\r\n=curtained= windows, and by the =red, green, or blue glass panes= over\r\nthe doors of entry. These coloured panes are so characteristic of these\r\nplaces of lust and gluttony that at the last year’s District Synod of\r\nthe Friedrichswerder section of the town of Berlin the attempt was made\r\n(_cf._ _Vossische Zeitung_, No. 248, May 30, 1906) to forbid the use of\r\nsuch illuminated panes for the advertisement of the houses of\r\nentertainment in Berlin with female attendants. To this proposal the\r\nreasonable objection was made that if this distinguishing mark were\r\nabolished, there would be no means of recognizing such places, and\r\ntherefore no warning signal for blameless individuals.\r\n\r\nMany “animierkneipen”--the French similarly term the girls in such\r\nplaces “_les inviteuses_”[306]--by their mysterious-looking interior; by\r\nthe heavy curtains, which produce semi-obscurity; by small very discreet\r\n_chambres séparées_, lighted by little coloured lanterns and with erotic\r\npictures on the walls; by their Spanish walls and their enormous\r\ncouches--obtain the appearance of small lupanars. To these the richer\r\ncustomers and the initiates are brought, whilst the ordinary habitual\r\nguests commonly assemble in the larger bars, where also music--it must\r\nbe admitted very bad music--in the form of a piano- or a zither-player,\r\nis not wanting.\r\n\r\nThe whole shameless activity of these “animierkneipen,” in which alcohol\r\nand indecency play the principal rôle, has recently been described by\r\nHermann Seyffert in a manner no less perspicuous than true to life.[307]\r\nThe clients of such places are, for the most part, immature lads, who\r\nsquander here the money of their parents or their employers; but we find\r\nthere also the habitual guests, usually elderly married men, who find in\r\nthis atmosphere a welcome variety in comparison with the monotony of\r\ntheir homes. The quantities of alcohol which are consumed in the\r\n“animierkneipen,” both by the guests and by the attendants, are\r\nenormous. The barmaids must always drink at the cost of the guests, in\r\norder that the sales of liquor may be larger. O. Rosenthal[308] speaks\r\nof barmaids who consume twenty to thirty glasses of beer a day, and\r\nmore, without mentioning brandy and liqueurs!\r\n\r\n2. =Ball-Rooms and Dancing-Saloons.=[309]--Properly speaking, these are\r\nonly a sub-variety of the places described in Section 1; they are\r\nenlarged “animierkneipen,” with the addition of (better) music and of\r\ndancing. But the beautiful days of the Bal Mabille and the Closerie des\r\nLilas, or of Cremorne Gardens, the Portland Rooms, the Argyll Rooms, and\r\nthe Orpheum have long passed away. The majority of the ball-rooms of\r\nBerlin and Paris (in London they disappeared long ago) have sunk to a\r\nlower level. Prostitution is now dominant. The “intimacy,” which in the\r\nearlier more idyllic ball-rooms felt so much at home, is now no longer\r\nto be found there. It is only necessary to visit the celebrated\r\nball-rooms of Berlin--the Ballhaus in the Joachimstrasse, the\r\n“Blumensäle,” etc., not to speak of the seats of baser prostitution, as,\r\nfor example, Lestmann’s Dancing-Saloon--in order to be aware of this\r\nfact. Here also the principal thing is drinking, and always more\r\ndrinking! In Paris, in the dancing-rooms of Montmartre, we can see the\r\n“inviteuses” in full cry; some of the French dancing-rooms, however,\r\nappear more attractive from the æsthetic point of view than the haunts\r\nof Terpsichore in Berlin. A dancing-saloon that was not exclusively\r\nconcerned with prostitution was that of Emberg in the Schumannstrasse,\r\nbut in the year 1906 this was closed for ever. Now, similar great\r\nball-rooms exist, properly speaking, only in the suburbs--in Halensee,\r\nGrünau, Nieder-Schönhausen, etc. Here also, however, the dance is not\r\nthe principal thing--procurement and prostitution are widely diffused,\r\nas was pointed out fifty years ago by Thomas Bade in his essay, in this\r\nrespect most convincing, “Ueber Gelegenheitsmacherei und Öffentliches\r\nTanzvergnügen”--“Procurement in Relation to Public Ball-Rooms” (Berlin,\r\n1858).\r\n\r\n3. =Variety Theatres, Low Music-Halls, and Cabarets.=--The principal\r\nobject of these places, so characteristic of our time, is “to kill time”\r\nin as amusing a manner as possible, “amusement” being what the “average\r\nsensual man” of to-day, dull and empty-headed, demands. What he wants is\r\nthe satisfaction of his desire for sensations by the appearance of more\r\nor less décolleté singers, dancers, acrobats, male and female, by the\r\nrepresentation of tableaux vivants in which the parts are played by\r\nbeautiful women, by the kinematograph, or by pantomime, by spicy songs,\r\nby the performance of clever jugglers, by wrestling and boxing matches\r\nbetween men and women, by juggling, and all kinds of spectacles, etc. In\r\nshort, the most diverse “varieties”--hence the name--of amusement are\r\noffered here, and it is significant that these places of pleasure first\r\nappeared in the great seaports of Liverpool, London, Hamburg, and\r\nMarseilles, where the sailors, after the weary monotony of long sea\r\nvoyages, found satisfaction in the variegated display of enjoyment\r\noffered to them in such places. Now the monotony, the emptiness of their\r\nlife, drives innumerable crowds of townsmen to the variety theatres,\r\nwhich, even though as little as the drinking-saloons can they be called\r\ntrue “places” of prostitution, still serve as localities in which\r\nprostitutes meet their clients; and in this way evening after evening a\r\nlarge number use them as the field of their activities.\r\n\r\nThe lowest class of variety theatre, the “_Tingel-Tangel_” (low\r\nmusic-hall), also euphemistically called “Academy of Music,” is, in\r\nfact, nothing more than a brothel, the only difference being that the\r\nactual sexual intercourse does not take place in the house itself, as so\r\noften occurs in the similar “animierkneipen.” The singers appearing in\r\nthese “tingel-tangel” are all low-class prostitutes. In most cases,\r\nwhilst one of their number is practising the “art of song” (_sit venia\r\nverbo_), the others, sitting about the hall in shameless décolleté,\r\ndisplay their charms, and incite (“animieren”) the visitors to drink.\r\nClerks and students form the indulgent audience; in seaport towns the\r\naudience consists generally of sailors. Who is not familiar with the\r\nmost celebrated tingel-tangel streets in the world, the Spielbudenplatz\r\nand the Reeperbahn, in St. Pauli, near the docks of Hamburg? In these\r\nstreets we see one variety theatre after another, and all are crowded by\r\na smoking, drinking audience, taking part in the choruses of the songs.\r\nA peculiar kind of these places of pleasure is constituted by the\r\nso-called “=Rummel=,” a speciality of Berlin. Wherever, within or\r\nwithout the town limits, by the demolition of old houses or in any other\r\nway, a large area remains free from building for a considerable time,\r\nthese tingel-tangel proprietors invade the place, erect merry-go-rounds\r\nand cake-stalls, and there develops in the place a manifold activity, in\r\nwhich the lower classes of the population exclusively share. Here the\r\nvery lowest types of prostitute seek their prey, and find it.\r\n\r\n4. “=Boarding-Houses=” (“=Pensionate=”) =and Maisons de Passe= (=Houses\r\nof Accommodation=).--Anyone walking through the streets of Berlin will\r\nnot fail to notice boards at the doors of certain houses, bearing the\r\ninscription, “Here rooms can be hired by the month, week, or day.” I do\r\nnot assert that this announcement =always= represents an invitation to\r\nfornication, or the provision of an opportunity therefor; but in many\r\ncases these announcements serve as indications of the “intercourse”\r\nobtainable in such dwellings. Often several stories, or even the entire\r\nhouse, is devoted to this purpose. It professes to be a “Private Hotel”\r\nor Furnished Lodgings; but in reality it is a masked brothel, a “house\r\nof accommodation” for prostitutes and their clients, a place in which\r\nthe landlord--in most cases the landlord is of the female sex--has for\r\nprincipal occupation the practice of procurement. Other dwellings,\r\n=without= these sufficiently well-known and suspicious boards attached\r\nto the door-posts, passing under the less striking name of a “pension,”\r\nare adapted rather for the exquisite and artificial enjoyment of the\r\nricher classes, and are employed for sexual orgies of a more extensive\r\ncharacter, for the procurement and seduction of young girls, and for the\r\nassignations of the higher classes of the demi-monde and their\r\nclientèle.\r\n\r\n5. “=Massage Institutes.=”--To these distinctly modern establishments,\r\nwhich mainly subserve the purposes of masochistic prostitution, we shall\r\nreturn in the chapter on masochism. Many prostitutes have some knowledge\r\nof massage, and masquerade as “masseuses”; their supplementary\r\nprofession is ordinary prostitution, and for this reason we are\r\njustified in alluding to them in this section.\r\n\r\n6. =The Weibercafés.=--These are found in all the large towns,\r\nespecially in London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna, and Buda-Pesth, and they\r\nserve as the principal places in which =prostitution is carried on by\r\nday=. Prostitutes sit here in great numbers hour after hour, and wait\r\nfor their clients, who, of course, must pay for drinks which are\r\nconsumed. Certain cafés in Berlin--as, for example, the “Café National,”\r\nthe Café Keck in the Leipziger Strasse, etc.--are typical =nocturnal\r\ncafes=, in which from the onset of darkness until early in the morning\r\nprostitutes await their clients.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the above classification does not include all varieties of\r\nmodern prostitution, which exhibits many other modes of activity. Most\r\nof these others, however, have some sort of relationship to the\r\nvarieties already described, and it is, therefore, unnecessary to deal\r\nwith them all at length. Prostitution can, of course, be practised\r\nanywhere; and its allurements are found in all places in which great\r\nnumbers of human beings come together.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nTHE HALF-WORLD\r\n\r\nTo prostitution in the wider sense of the term belongs also the\r\n“=half-world=” (“demi-monde”), under which name, first used by the\r\nyounger Dumas, we include the various categories of “mistresses,” femmes\r\nsoutenues (kept women), lorettes, cocottes, and fast women.\r\n\r\nAlexandre Dumas, in the celebrated passage of his play “Demi-Monde” (Act\r\nII., Scene 9), gives by the mouth of Olivier de Jalin the following\r\ndefinition of the half-world:\r\n\r\n  “All these women have made a false step in their past; they have a\r\n  small black spot upon their name, and they go in company as much as\r\n  possible, so that the spot may be less conspicuous. They have the same\r\n  origin, the same appearance, the same prejudices as good society; but\r\n  they no longer belong to it, and they form that which we call the\r\n  half-world (demi-monde), which floats like an island upon the ocean of\r\n  Paris, and draws towards itself, assumes, and recognizes, everything\r\n  which falls from the firm land, or which wanders out or runs away from\r\n  the firm land, without counting the foreign shipwrecked individuals\r\n  who come no man knows whence.\r\n\r\n  “Since the married men, under the protection of the legal code, have\r\n  had the right to banish from the bosom of the family a woman who has\r\n  forgotten her duty, the morals of married life have undergone a\r\n  revolution which has created a new world--for what becomes of all\r\n  these expelled, compromised women? The first of them who found herself\r\n  shown the door, bewailed her fault, and hid her shame in retirement;\r\n  but--the second? She sought the first one out, and as soon as there\r\n  were two of them, they called the fault a misfortune, the crime a\r\n  mistake, and began to make excuses for one another mutually. Having\r\n  become three, they asked one another to dinner; having become\r\n  four--they danced a quadrille. Now round these women there grouped\r\n  themselves young girls also who had begun their life with a false\r\n  step; false widows; women who bore the name of the lovers with whom\r\n  they lived; some of those rapid ‘marriages’ which had lasted as\r\n  liaisons of many years’ duration; finally, all the women who wished\r\n  people to believe that they were something else than they really were,\r\n  and did not wish to appear in their true colours. At the present day\r\n  this irregular world is in full bloom, and its bastard society is\r\n  greatly loved by young men. For here love is less difficult than in\r\n  circles above--and not so expensive as in circles below.”\r\n\r\nFrom the last sentence we see that the original idea of the “half-world”\r\nwas not so wide as that of the present day; above all, the former notion\r\ndid not, as it does at present, include the idea of prostitution. The\r\nladies of the half-world of Dumas were “not so expensive” as ordinary\r\nprostitutes. Our modern demi-mondaines are characterized by the fact\r\nthat their price is high. They are prostitutes for the upper ten\r\nthousand. And yet they have this in common with the other\r\ndemi-monde--that they do not, like prostitutes properly speaking, give\r\nthemselves indifferently to anyone able to pay the price, but they lay\r\nstress on the social position of their lover for the time being, and\r\nupon his character as a “gentleman.” They can even exhibit something of\r\nthe nature of love. The modern half-world can most aptly be compared\r\nwith the Greek hetairism. It forms a characteristic constituent of\r\nmodern “high life.” Whether this especially manifests itself on the\r\nracecourse, at first nights at the theatre, in great charitable bazaars,\r\nat masked balls, at fashionable seaside resorts, at Monte Carlo, at\r\nfloral festivals, and the like, there also we encounter the half-world;\r\nand its members, in respect of beauty, toilet, distinguished appearance,\r\ncultivation, and conversation, are in no way to be distinguished from\r\nthe ladies of high society. Certain types of the demi-monde realize, in\r\nfact, the ideal of the Greek hetairæ; but even more than these, the\r\nmodern demi-mondaine represents elaborated enjoyment. These women are\r\nthoroughly cultivated, the true law-givers of fashion, the arbiters in\r\nevery question of taste. Mondaines and demi-mondaines are in outward\r\nappearance hardly to be distinguished one from the other; at least,\r\nthis is the case in Paris, where a witty writer defined the distinction\r\nbetween them in this way--that the former received their lovers only in\r\nthe daytime, the latter also by night.[310] It is only the connoisseur\r\nwho is able to detect the “half-world aroma,” that indefinable quality\r\nwhich gives the demi-mondaine such an exceptional value in the eyes of\r\nthe _jeunesse dorée_.\r\n\r\nFrom what circles do the recruits of the half-world come? The ladies of\r\nthe theatre, the stars of the variety stage and of the ballet, send\r\ntheir contingent; the aristocracy is also represented in their ranks;\r\nbut many a distinguished lorette or “fille de marbre” is of low origin,\r\nand yet understands admirably how to adapt herself rapidly to all the\r\ndemands of high life, to drive her dog-cart as smartly as the most\r\ngenuine Countess, and in Longchamps, Karlshorst, Ostend, or Trouville,\r\nto play the part of the fine lady.\r\n\r\nThe one distinction between them--and it is the distinction of half a\r\nworld--is the fact that this fashionable life of the demi-monde is not\r\nprovided out of their own means, but out of the pockets of one, or more\r\noften of several, rich galants.\r\n\r\nThe type of the “grande cocotte” is encountered in its genuine and\r\nunadulterated form only in Paris. Here the demi-mondaine plays a great\r\npart in public life. The time of the earlier mistresses of princes, with\r\ntheir political intrigues and their far-reaching spheres of influence,\r\nis indeed over--a Lola Montez, an Aurora Königsmark is to-day no longer\r\npossible; and yet the Parisian demi-mondaine maintains influential\r\nrelationships with the new great power of our time--the power of the\r\n=press=. The journalists who are in the service of the demi-monde are by\r\nGeorge Dahlen termed the “Press-Fridoline,” because “their pens are\r\npaid, not with ducats, but with more or less enviable hours of love in\r\ndistinguished boudoirs”;[311] and Victor Joze also describes the\r\nadvertisements--paid for by a night of love, or perhaps only by a\r\nsmile--which the writers of Paris give in the newspapers to the\r\ndistinguished cocottes of the Quartier Marbœuf or of the Avenue du Bois\r\nde Boulogne, in order to attract the attention of Indian nabobs, Russian\r\nGrand Dukes, or American millionaires, to this or that fashionable\r\nbeauty. This is characteristic of Paris. In other great capitals\r\nmarketable gallantry does not seek publicity in this way, but pursues a\r\nmore hidden course.\r\n\r\nFor what the German, and especially what the Berliners, term the\r\n“half-world” is very different from the type we have just described of\r\nthe true Parisian demi-mondaine. Our half-world (the half-world of\r\nBerlin) is recruited for the most part from intelligent prostitutes, who\r\nare to be found chiefly in the public gardens, in the Zoological\r\nGardens, in the Lehrter Ausstellungspark, and in the leading\r\nrestaurants. Here =every evening= they seek new prey, every evening they\r\nsell their charms to a new lover for a definite sum of money; whereas\r\nthe true lady of the half-world never has at any time more than one or\r\ntwo admirers, who provide for all the expenses of her life, and she\r\nnever--at any rate =in public=--practises professional prostitution, as\r\ndo the women just described.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is yet another type, which must not be confused with the\r\ndemi-monde. This is the =international prostitute=, who journeys from\r\none place to another, has indeed often the appearance of a distinguished\r\nlorette, but leads a much more insecure, unstable life than the true\r\ndemi-mondaine, and often combines with prostitution the profession of an\r\nadventuress. Now she is in Paris, now in London, now at Biarritz, now at\r\nMonte Carlo (the principal field of her activity), now in\r\nConstantinople, Smyrna, St. Petersburg, or Berlin. Sometimes she\r\nundertakes a voyage of discovery to the New World. Germany provides a\r\nnot insignificant percentage of these international cocottes. Such\r\nwanderers are especially well known in the circles of officers and of\r\nspeculators on the Bourse; by these they are not seldom “recommended,”\r\nafter the manner in which a traveller is given letters of introduction.\r\nThey may even be “raffled for,” as recently happened in an officers’\r\nmess in Munich, and so pass to the share of the fortunate (generally\r\nmuch to be commiserated) winner. Abroad they prefer to adopt French or\r\nexotic names.\r\n\r\n  [243] Here, in the phrase “man at length become self-conscious,” we\r\n  have the animating idea of this work, as it is of all fruitful efforts\r\n  at the amelioration of the human lot. See the admirable development of\r\n  this idea in E. Ray Lankester’s Romanes lecture, “Nature and Man”; and\r\n  also in H. G. Wells’s later writings, more especially “A Modern\r\n  Utopia” and “New Worlds for Old.”--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n  [244] That this opinion is false, I have proved incontestably as\r\n  regards syphilis in my book, “The Origin of Syphilis” (Jena, 1901).\r\n  For the European and Asiatic world, syphilis is a specifically modern\r\n  disease, not more than 400 years old.\r\n\r\n  [245] Venice, 1534.\r\n\r\n  [246] “La Lozana Andaluza” (“The Gentle Andalusian”), by Francesco\r\n  Delicado.

Incredible\r\n  revelations of this traffic, of the almost absolute power of the\r\n  procuresses, and of their relations to the police, led in October,\r\n  1906, to an action against the procuress Regine Riehl, who, under the\r\n  mask of a dressmaker’s shop, had for years conducted a brothel, in\r\n  which the girls were entirely robbed of their freedom, were subjected\r\n  to corporal punishment, and never received payment for their “work.”\r\n  _Cf._ A.

I say the principal “=focus=,” not the “cause.” For, if all\r\nprostitutes were =healthy=, we could leave prostitution quietly\r\nalone--leaving out of consideration the moral depravity to which it\r\ngives rise--and venereal diseases would spontaneously disappear.\r\n\r\nThis opinion I advance at the beginning of the chapter on venereal\r\ndiseases because, even at the present day, there is a remarkable species\r\nof =philosophy, or rather theology, of venereal diseases=, which\r\npropounds the most extraordinary hypothesis regarding their =origin=.\r\n\r\nFor example, the Alsatian writer Alexander Weill, in his confused work\r\n“The Laws and Mysteries of Love,” writes:\r\n\r\n  “Why should we bother our heads about the cure of syphilis? If anyone\r\n  wishes to get rid of any evil, he must first of all ascertain its\r\n  causes in order to remove these. If the cause of it is removed, the\r\n  evil disappears spontaneously. If the snake has been killed, its\r\n  poison no longer does any harm. But how can we put an end to the\r\n  causes of syphilis, when this disease is spontaneously renewed and\r\n  increased day by day by means of neglected prostitution, and by our\r\n  social laws which combine to oppose the monogamy of youth and the\r\n  increase of population? If to-day we could cure all patients suffering\r\n  from syphilis, =to-morrow the same disease would return in a new form,\r\n  for it would be recreated by the same irregularities that first led to\r\n  its production= (!) It is absolutely useless to employ iodide of\r\n  potassium and mercury, for every new infringement of natural laws\r\n  would again bring into being new incurable diseases, which can only be\r\n  avoided by those who have firmly resolved to observe these laws\r\n  strictly.”\r\n\r\nWeill, indeed, goes so far as to maintain that every man who\r\n=simultaneously, or rather in brief succession, has intercourse with two\r\nhealthy women, acquires syphilis=, even although both these women remain\r\nfaithful to him, because “=any kind of libertinism in sexual intercourse\r\nsuffices by itself to give rise to this disease=!”\r\n\r\nAccording to this view, which is shared by many members of the laity,\r\nvenereal diseases, and, above all, the worst of them, syphilis, would be\r\nas old as sexual licentiousness itself--that is, =as old as the human\r\nrace, and an inalienable associate of that race=.\r\n\r\nIn my book on “The Origin of Syphilis” I have disproved this view. I\r\nhave answered the question, so important alike on general philosophical\r\nand on social-hygienic grounds, regarding the true nature of syphilis,\r\nand have proved that syphilis (and also the other venereal diseases) had\r\na definite =local= and =temporal= origin; that syphilis has not existed\r\nsince the beginning of time; and that some day, when certain definite\r\nconditions are fulfilled, the disease will disappear.\r\n\r\nThe history of syphilis is a matter of profound =practical= importance.\r\nFrom that history we learn with certainty that the most dangerous and\r\nmost dreaded of the venereal diseases has, for the European world, and\r\nfor the “old world” in general, the character of a =pure chance comer=;\r\nand we learn that =retrospectively=--regarded from the point of view of\r\nour present experience--at the time when the disease first began to\r\nflourish, it might perhaps have been nipped in the bud.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly possible to overestimate the =practical= importance of the\r\nrecognition of this fact--that for the old civilized world syphilis\r\nrepresents a historical phenomenon, that it has a history, a beginning,\r\nor, as Voltaire half-ironically remarks, a genealogy.\r\n\r\nIs there not a deliverance, a redemption, in the idea that for the old\r\nworld there was a time in which syphilis did not exist; that this time,\r\nin comparison with the time which has elapsed since syphilis first\r\nappeared, was almost infinitely long; and that for this reason, when we\r\nlook out into the future, the history of the lues venerea assumes the\r\ncharacter of a simple episode in the history of European civilized\r\nhumanity?\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the definite acceptance of this view would be an\r\nurgent warning to all those obscurantists of both sexes who imagine that\r\nthe problem of the diffusion of venereal diseases can be solved\r\nexclusively by religious and moral considerations, and who thus confuse\r\nthe simplest and clearest relationships, place everything upon an\r\ninsecure foundation, and exclude every possibility of a successful\r\ncampaign against syphilis.\r\n\r\nEven to-day it unfortunately happens that many continue, as of old, to\r\nbelieve that sexual intercourse is a sin for which a punishment has been\r\nprovided, and that this punishment is a venereal disease--for example,\r\nsyphilis. Tylor, the celebrated English anthropologist, has proved that\r\nthis idea has developed out of the =animism= extending back into\r\nprehistoric times, which regarded all illnesses as the work of demons.\r\nWe are still influenced by this doctrine, this gloomy, demoniacal\r\nconception in respect of everything sexual. I need hardly remind the\r\nreader of the ideas of Tolstoi, and of his disciple, the unhappy Dr.\r\nWeininger, a disciple exceeding even his master in respect of fanatical\r\ncondemnation of sexual intercourse. Until recently the laws regulating\r\nour German system of workmen’s insurance against illness continued to\r\nexhibit definite traces of our legislators’ adhesion to this view. The\r\nmajority of physicians and historians who said that syphilis was as old\r\nas sexual intercourse itself, who employed the phrase _ubi Venus ibi\r\nsyphilis_, were unconsciously influenced by this idea, that venereal\r\ndiseases are to be regarded as a mark of the Divine wrath.\r\n\r\nThis theological theory, as we may call it, of the origin of syphilis is\r\nopposed by certain incontrovertible facts, which suffice to show its\r\nutter nullity and untenability.\r\n\r\nThe mere fact that there exists a =blameless= infection with syphilis\r\n(_syphilis innocentium_), that, for example, in certain districts of\r\nRussia as many as 90 % of the cases of this disease are acquired =quite\r\nindependently= of sexual intercourse, by simple contact, shows the\r\nabsurdity of this superstitious idea.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, it is a widely known fact that quite frequently\r\npersons who are still entirely uncontaminated, blameless initiates,\r\nbecome infected with syphilis on the very first occasion in which they\r\nhave sexual intercourse, whilst greater experience and more exact\r\nknowledge of the threatening dangers induce notorious debauchees to\r\nadopt effective measures of protection (which, however, would be useless\r\nif syphilis were really a divinely decreed punishment for licentiousness\r\nof this kind!).\r\n\r\nIn the third place, the occurrence of syphilis =in little\r\nchildren=--partly owing to inheritance, partly, however, acquired in the\r\nway already mentioned by casual contact--affords a striking refutation\r\nof the above idea, which, unfortunately, still dominates and fascinates\r\na large circle of people.\r\n\r\nWe could adduce further arguments against this view, but what we have\r\nsaid should suffice to show clearly the untenability of such a\r\nsuperstition. The syphilis of one individual is not the consequence of\r\nsexual intercourse, but the consequence of another case of syphilis in\r\nanother individual--that is to say, syphilis is a =specific infective\r\ndisease=, transmissible only by means of its peculiar specific virus,\r\nand this transmission can be effected =without any sexual intercourse=,\r\nby means of contacts of other kinds. =Syphilis arises only from\r\nsyphilis.=\r\n\r\nWe have, therefore, to attack =this= disease precisely in the same\r\nmanner as the other venereal diseases. As a Portuguese physician has\r\nmost aptly remarked, to the tyranny of syphilis we must oppose the\r\ntyranny of human reason. The principal aim of a campaign against\r\nvenereal diseases will be the =organization= of the means offered to us\r\nby reason and experience to cope with the disease. The knowledge of\r\nthese means must be diffused in ever-wider circles of humanity, and care\r\nmust be taken that every individual is fully and clearly informed\r\nregarding the importance and the dangers of syphilis and the other\r\nvenereal diseases.\r\n\r\nHere also history is our teacher, our lamp of truth, and promises us\r\ncomplete success as the result of our campaign against venereal\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nThe results of my investigations regarding the origin of syphilis all\r\npoint to a =single= extremely important fact--namely, that in the case\r\nof syphilis, and as regards the “old world,” we have to do with a\r\n=specific disease of modern times=, which made its first appearance =at\r\nthe end of the fifteenth century=, and of the previous existence of\r\nwhich, even in the most distant prehistoric times, not the minutest\r\ntrace remains. This view was held by very eminent physicians, even\r\nbefore the publication of my own critical work, based upon entirely new\r\nsources of study. Among these authorities I may mention Jean Astruc and\r\nChristoph Girtanner, in the eighteenth century; in the nineteenth\r\ncentury, the Spanish army surgeon Montejo, and of German physicians,\r\nabove all, Rudolf Virchow, A. Geigel, von Liebermeister, C. Binz, and P.\r\nG. Unna. The great philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer held the same\r\nview.[312]\r\n\r\nRicord, the celebrated French syphilologist, spoke once of a romance of\r\nsyphilis which still remained to be written. I should rather compare it\r\nwith a =drama=, the separate acts of which are =centuries=. Of this\r\ndrama, =four= acts have already been played. At the present moment we\r\nfind ourselves at the =beginning= of the =fifth= act. Thus, we have an\r\n=entire= century before us, in which, with all the powers placed at our\r\ndisposal by scientific medical research, by practical therapeutics, and\r\nby hygiene in association with social measures, we must work to this\r\nend, that this fifth act shall also be the =last=, as it is in the case\r\nof a proper drama.\r\n\r\nThe history of syphilis has remained so long obscure, because, until the\r\ntime of Philipp Ricord--=that is to say, until the beginning of the\r\nsecond half of the nineteenth century=--the three venereal diseases,\r\n=syphilis=, or =lues=, the so-called =soft chancre= (=venereal ulcer or\r\nchancroid=), and =gonorrhœa=, were regarded as essentially one disease;\r\nwhereas we know to-day that syphilis is a specific infective disease of\r\na =constitutional= character, which permeates the whole body, and must\r\nbe absolutely distinguished from the other venereal diseases, these\r\nlatter being purely =local= in character. This earlier belief in the\r\nidentity of all venereal infections, an error held even by so great an\r\nauthority as John Hunter, who was misled by falsely interpreted\r\nexperiments, renders it necessary that the historical side of the\r\nquestion should be considered also from this point of view.\r\n\r\nIf gonorrhœa and chancroid were of a syphilitic nature, then certainly\r\nsyphilis must have existed from very early times. It would not be\r\ndifficult to refer to syphilis some descriptions and accounts of\r\ndiseases of the genital organs given by the ancient and medieval\r\nwriters. It was the progressive enlightenment regarding the essential\r\ndifferences between the three venereal diseases which first proved the\r\nuntenability of such opinions; we were further assisted by the knowledge\r\nof =pseudo-venereal= and =pseudo-syphilitic= diseases which we have\r\nobtained from modern dermatology. Moreover, in the old world syphilitic\r\nbones belonging to ancient or medieval times have =never= been\r\ndiscovered.[313] The first syphilitic bones date from =after the time of\r\nthe discovery of America=. They appear, above all, =after the outbreak\r\nof the great epidemic of syphilis which followed the Italian campaign of\r\nKing Charles VIII. of France, in the years 1494 and 1495=; it was then\r\nthat syphilis first became diffused in the old world.\r\n\r\nIn my work on “The Origin of Syphilis” (Jena, 1901),[314] I have adduced\r\nproof, basing my views upon the criticism of older opinions, and\r\nassisted by the utilization of very abundant new sources of material,\r\nthat syphilis was first introduced into Spain in the years 1493 and 1494\r\nby the crew of Columbus, who brought it from Central America, and more\r\nespecially from the island of =Hayti=; from Spain it was carried by the\r\narmy of Charles VIII. to Italy, where it assumed an epidemic form; and\r\nafter the army was disbanded the disease was transported by the soldiers\r\nto the other countries of Europe, and also was soon taken by the\r\nPortuguese to the Far East, to India, China, and Japan. At the time of\r\nits first appearance in the old world, syphilis was extraordinarily\r\n=virulent=. All the morbid phenomena produced by the disease had a more\r\nrapid and violent course than at the present day; the mortality was much\r\nhigher; the consequences, even when a cure was effected, were much more\r\nsevere. This virulence of syphilis at the time of its first introduction\r\ncan only be explained, in accordance with our modern views of the nature\r\nand mode of appearances of the disease, by the fact that the nations of\r\nthe old world (who, _nota bene_, were =all= attacked with equal\r\nintensity) had, until that time, been =completely free= from syphilis.\r\n=All classes= of the people and =all nations= were visited by syphilis\r\nto an equal extent and with the same violence.\r\n\r\nEven to-day we observe everywhere, when syphilis is introduced into\r\nregions which have hitherto been =free= from the disease, that it has\r\nthe same acute course, the same violence of morbid manifestations, that\r\ncharacterized its first appearance in Europe. In the four centuries that\r\nhave elapsed since its introduction into Europe there has occurred a\r\ngradual =mitigation= of the syphilitic virus, or rather a certain degree\r\nof immunization of European humanity against the disease. Speaking\r\ngenerally, syphilis has to-day--in comparison with that earlier time--a\r\nrelatively mild course. To this point we shall return later.[315]\r\n\r\nThe two other venereal diseases, =gonorrhœa= and =chancroid=,\r\nunquestionably existed in Europe in the days of antiquity. But they also\r\nare =specific infective diseases=, and are only produced by the virus\r\npeculiar to each, just as syphilis has its own peculiar virus.\r\n\r\nRicord (1800-1889), in the years 1830 to 1850, proved the complete\r\n=diversity= of syphilis and gonorrhœa, established the doctrine of the\r\nthree stages of syphilis--primary, secondary, and tertiary--and,\r\nfinally, taught us to distinguish the =soft, non-syphilitic chancre=\r\n(=chancroid=) from the =hard, syphilitic chancre=. Virchow, in his\r\ncelebrated essay on “The Nature of Constitutional Syphilitic Affections”\r\n(_Virchow’s Archiv_, 1858, vol. xv., p. 217 _et seq._), then threw a\r\nclear light on the peculiar course of constitutional syphilis and on the\r\ncauses of the occasional disappearance and sudden reappearance of the\r\nmorbid phenomena. Hitherto, however, our knowledge of venereal diseases\r\nhad rested on an extremely insecure foundation; and =the truly\r\nscientific study of the subject= may be said to have begun in the year\r\n1879, with Albert Neisser’s epoch-making discovery of the =gonococcus=\r\nas the specific exciting cause of gonorrhœa. In the years 1889 to 1892\r\nthere followed the discovery of the =bacillus of chancroid= by Ducrey\r\nand Unna, by means of which discovery the complete distinction between\r\nthe soft and the hard chancre was definitely proved; and, finally, the\r\nthree years 1903 to 1906 were characterized by =remarkable discoveries=,\r\nthe full importance of which is not as yet fully realized, =regarding\r\nthe nature of the syphilitic virus=. In the year 1903 Eli Metchnikoff\r\nsucceeded in transmitting syphilis from human beings to =apes=, and thus\r\nlaid the foundation for progressive research regarding syphilis by means\r\nof experiments on animals; this was carried further by Lassar, by the\r\ninoculation of the syphilitic virus from one ape to another, and also by\r\nA. Neisser in his experimental researches in Java;[316] and in March,\r\n1905, the Berlin protozoologist Fritz Schaudinn, since prematurely lost\r\nto the world of science, published his first studies on the probable\r\nexciting cause of syphilis, the so-called “=spirochæte pallida=.”\r\nNumerous subsequent investigations have established the connexion\r\nbetween this spirilla-form, belonging to the order of protozoa, and\r\nsyphilitic disease. In this way we have been brought notably nearer to\r\nthe discovery of the certain cure of syphilis and to the discovery of\r\nmeans of immunization against the disease. In this direction quite new\r\nviews are opening before our eyes.[317] Numerous ideas suggested by\r\nrecent discoveries in the province of syphilitic research are described\r\nin the admirable essay by J. Jadassohn, “Contributions to Syphilology,”\r\npublished in the German “Archives for Dermatology and Syphilis,” 1907.\r\n_Cf._ also the account of the recent doctrines regarding syphilis by P.\r\nG. Unna and Iwan Bloch, “Die Praxis der Hautkrankheiten,” pp. 548-592\r\n(Vienna and Berlin, 1908).\r\n\r\nWhen some day humanity has been freed from the “=sexual plague=,” from\r\nthe hydra of venereal diseases, and when a monument is erected to the\r\nliberators, four names will there be commemorated: Ricord, Neisser,\r\nMetchnikoff, and Schaudinn!\r\n\r\nAfter these preliminary remarks on the nature of venereal diseases, I\r\nproceed to a short description of them, and I begin with the most\r\ndangerous of all the venereal diseases, =syphilis=.[318]\r\n\r\nThe first manifestations of syphilis make their appearance about three\r\nor four weeks =after= infection, at the place at which infection has\r\noccurred, and this is not in every case the genital organs. It is true\r\nthat syphilis is most commonly transmitted by means of sexual\r\nintercourse, but frequently also by contacts of other kinds--for\r\nexample, by =kissing=; by gynecological or surgical examinations and\r\noperations; by =drinking from a glass= which has previously been used by\r\nsome one suffering from syphilis; by the use of uncleansed\r\npocket-handkerchiefs, towels, and bedding, which have been used by a\r\nsyphilitic patient; by the use of tobacco-pipes, wind-instruments,\r\ntooth-brushes, tooth-picks, a glass-blower’s mouthpiece, etc., belonging\r\nto strangers; =by an uncleansed razor=; by the nasty habit of licking\r\nthe point of a pencil; by moistening postage-stamps with the tongue; by\r\nsucking the wound in circumcision; =by the suckling of the infant at the\r\nbreast of a syphilitic wet-nurse=, etc.[319] In England the custom, when\r\ntaking a judicial oath, of kissing the Bible has repeatedly sufficed to\r\ntransmit syphilitic infection.\r\n\r\nIn certain districts in which the level of civilization is a low\r\none--as, for example, in some parts of Russia and of Turkey--as many as\r\n50 to 60 % of all infections occur independently of sexual intercourse.\r\n\r\nAll the =discharges= from syphilitic lesions in all three stages of the\r\ndisease are infective. The infective character of the tertiary stage of\r\nsyphilis was formerly doubted, but has recently been proved beyond\r\ndispute. =Blood= also, although more rarely, can prove infective. On the\r\nother hand, the =pure= secretions--that is, the physiological\r\nsecretions, not contaminated by morbid products--such as the saliva,\r\ntears, and milk, are not infective. Syphilis is, however, very\r\nfrequently transmitted by means of the =semen=.\r\n\r\nInfection occurs in places in which there is a solution of continuity of\r\nthe skin or mucous membrane, such as a scratch or a superficial wound,\r\nthrough which the virus can enter. In this way an apparently healthy\r\nsyphilitic patient--when, for example, he gets a small abrasion on the\r\npenis (or, in the case of a woman, in the vagina)--can transmit syphilis\r\nif the other individual also has a similar abrasion through which\r\ninfection can occur.\r\n\r\nAs we have said, it is not till the lapse of two to four weeks after\r\ninfection has occurred that the first manifestations of syphilis appear,\r\nin the form of a small vesicle or nodule in the infected area; less\r\noften merely an abraded area of a peculiar red colour. Gradually this\r\nnodule or area enlarges, and becomes continually =harder= at the base,\r\nwhilst the surface often undergoes ulceration, and secretes extremely\r\ninfective pus (the so-called “=hard chancre=” or “=primary\r\nlesion=”[320]).\r\n\r\nThis induration is in most cases a certain sign that the syphilitic\r\nvirus has already entered the body; at least, it has only been possible\r\nin a few very rare cases, by excision or cauterization of the hard\r\nchancre, to prevent syphilis from entering the blood. Almost always,\r\nnotwithstanding such endeavours, the manifestations of general infection\r\nof the body soon appear.\r\n\r\nFrom the place of infection--that is, from the place at which the hard\r\nchancre forms--the syphilitic virus next passes by way of the\r\nlymph-stream into the inguinal glands, so that these, in the third or\r\nfourth week after the appearance of the hard chancre, begin to swell and\r\nto become hard. This swelling of the inguinal glands is painless (the\r\nso-called “=indolent bubo=”), in contrast to the painful swelling which\r\naccompanies the soft chancre. From this region the poison now proceeds\r\nby way of the bloodvessels and lymph paths on its wanderings all over\r\nthe body, the individual stages of which can be detected by swellings of\r\nthe lymph-glands of the axilla, the elbow, the neck, etc. Sometimes\r\nother symptoms of general infection are noticeable; above all, the\r\nappearance of =fever= (never earlier than forty days after infection),\r\n=pains= in the muscles, joints, nerves, also severe headaches, a general\r\nfeeling of =lassitude=, =pallor=, and a falling-off in the nutritive\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThese are the forerunners of the so-called =secondary= stage of\r\nsyphilis, which now manifests itself by the appearance of a multiform\r\n=skin eruption=, rendering the diagnosis of syphilis absolutely\r\ncertain. For this reason, in doubtful cases of ulceration of the genital\r\norgans the patient should inspect his skin very carefully every day for\r\nseveral weeks or months, and keep watch for the appearance of red spots\r\nor nodules. This syphilitic eruption on the skin is also in the later\r\nperiods one of the most certain and most characteristic insignia of the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThe eruption commonly appears first on the trunk, in the form of\r\nrose-coloured spots (the so-called “=roseola syphilitica=”), spreads\r\nthence over the whole body, and in many cases, simultaneously with or\r\nshortly after the spotted eruption, =nodules= appear on the skin, and\r\nmarked thickenings form on the mucous membranes, especially at the anus,\r\nin the mouth, and on the tongue (the so-called “=plaques muqueuses=,” or\r\n“=condylomata=”). The patient’s attention is spontaneously directed to\r\nthese lesions by painful sensations in the mouth or by itching of the\r\nanus. Often it is these painful sensations, associated with a violent\r\ninflammation of the tonsils and pharynx (the so-called “=angina\r\nsyphilitica=”), which first lead the patient to consult a doctor, after\r\nall the earlier symptoms have passed by unnoticed! As characteristic\r\nforms of the secondary syphilitic changes in the skin must, therefore,\r\nbe mentioned the so-called “=corona Veneris=,” by which distinguished\r\nname is denoted an eruption on the forehead, especially along the margin\r\nof the hair, which by members of the laity is easily confused with other\r\naffections of the skin common in this locality; the so-called “=collier\r\nde Venus=,” or =leukoderma syphiliticum=, a peculiar pigmentation of the\r\nskin on the throat and the back of the neck in the form of =brown=\r\npatches with =white= intervening areas. This symptom, =which occurs\r\nalmost exclusively= in women, is an absolutely certain sign of syphilis.\r\nEqually characteristic is the so-called “=syphilitic psoriasis=,” the\r\nappearance of peculiar patches and thickenings on the palms of the hands\r\nand the soles of the feet; characteristic also is the syphilitic =loss\r\nof hair=, by its sudden onset and by the patchy way in which it occurs.\r\nNot rarely do we see =purulent= eruptions on the skin in this secondary\r\nstage of syphilis.\r\n\r\nThe syphilitic eruption of the skin is only an external manifestation of\r\na disease affecting the entire body, for the internal organs also\r\nsuffer. The affection of the liver manifests itself by jaundice; that of\r\nthe brain and the meninges by headaches and by =weakness of memory=,\r\nwhich is often well marked at this stage; that of the spleen by\r\nswelling; that of the kidneys by the appearance of albumin in the urine;\r\nthat of the bones by very painful inflammatory swellings; that of the\r\neyes specially by the well-known =syphilitic iritis= (60 % of all\r\ninflammations of the iris are syphilitic in nature!).\r\n\r\nIf the disease remains untreated, the appearances just described become\r\nmore general and continually more severe; and after some time, quite new\r\nmorbid symptoms are superadded (often as early as the third year, on the\r\naverage five to ten years after infection, but also later), resulting\r\nfrom the transformation of the syphilitic morbid process into the\r\n=tertiary= stage. To these new manifestations belong the appearance of\r\nlarge =nodules= in the skin and other organs, which sooner or later\r\nundergo ulceration, the so-called “=syphilitic gummata=”; their\r\nulcerative destruction may entail the greatest disfigurement or danger\r\nto life--for example, perforation of the hard palate; sinking of the\r\nbridge of the nose (the syphilitic “=saddle-nose=”); ulcerative\r\ndestruction of large portions of the bones of the skull, of the\r\nintestine, of the liver, the lungs, the testicles, the bloodvessels\r\n(especially dangerous are gummous diseases of the bloodvessels of the\r\nbrain), the brain, and the spinal cord. =Apoplectic strokes= occurring\r\nin comparatively young persons and =nervous paralysis= of the most\r\nvarious kinds, as well as sudden =deafness= and =blindness=, are in most\r\ncases referable to syphilitic disease. Many chronic diseases of the\r\nliver, kidneys, and nervous system, are consequences of previous\r\nsyphilis; also =calcification of the arteries=, the very dangerous\r\ndilatation of the great bloodvessels, especially of the aorta (aneurism\r\nof the aorta), are very often of syphilitic origin.\r\n\r\nBy the researches of Alfred Fournier and Wilhelm Erb, we know to-day\r\nthat two severe diseases of the central nervous system--=tabes dorsalis=\r\nor =locomotor ataxy=, and =general paralysis of the insane= (=paralytic\r\ndementia=)--are almost always (in about 95 % of the cases) referable to\r\nearlier syphilis. Among 5,749 cases of syphilis encountered in his own\r\nprivate practice, Fournier observed no less than 758 cases of brain\r\nsyphilis, 631 cases of tabes, and 83 cases of softening of the brain.\r\nTabes and general paralysis of the insane are all the more dangerous\r\nbecause they are no longer, properly speaking, “syphilitic” diseases,\r\nand therefore they cannot be cured by antisyphilitic treatment; they are\r\nsevere degenerative changes of the central nervous system, which has\r\nbeen, as it were, prepared for their occurrence by the previous\r\nsyphilis. These belong to the class of the so-called “=parasyphilitic=”\r\ndiseases in which antisyphilitic treatment has little or no good effect.\r\n\r\nEven more tragic are the consequences of syphilis to the =family=, the\r\n=offspring=, and the =race=. =Syphilis in married life=, =congenital\r\nsyphilis=, and the =degeneration of the race by syphilis=--these are the\r\ntragic manifestations which come under consideration in this connexion.\r\n\r\nIn his admirable work on “Syphilis and Marriage,” Alfred Fournier, the\r\ngreatest living authority on syphilis in all its manifestations and\r\nrelationships, has described the momentous influence exercised by\r\nsyphilis in conjugal life; and in his recently published work, “Syphilis\r\na Social Danger,” he has dealt also with congenital syphilis and racial\r\ndegeneration. He found that, on the average, among 100 women suffering\r\nfrom syphilis, 20 had been infected by their husbands, either at the\r\nvery commencement of married life, or in its later course, or finally\r\nthrough the offspring after conception. Divorce on the ground of\r\nsyphilitic infection by the husband is at the present day of frequent\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nThe transmission of syphilis to the child by =inheritance= may be\r\neffected either by the father or the mother; when both the father and\r\nthe mother are syphilitic, it occurs with absolute certainty. The\r\nvarious possibilities of transmission, and the contingent immunity of\r\nmother or child, as they are expressed in Colles’s law (Baumès’s law),\r\nand in Profeta’s law, cannot here be further dealt with. If the mother\r\nhas herself been infected with syphilis, or if she was previously\r\nsyphilitic, either the child is not carried until term, abortion or\r\nmiscarriage ensuing, or, finally, it is born with symptoms of congenital\r\nsyphilis.[321]\r\n\r\nThe frequent occurrence of premature births and still-births in any\r\nfamily suggests strong suspicions that they are due to syphilis. The\r\n=general mortality= of the children in a family is regarded by Fournier\r\nas an important sign to the physician of congenital syphilis. Syphilitic\r\ninfection of the father gives rise to a mortality in the children of\r\n28 %; syphilis in the mother causes a mortality in the children of 60 %;\r\nwhen the disease affects both parents, the mortality among the children\r\namounts to 68 %. Absolutely astounding is the mortality of the children\r\nof syphilitic prostitutes; it amounts to from 84 to 86 %.\r\n\r\nChildren born =alive=, suffering from congenital syphilis, are generally\r\nweakly,[322] of deficient body-weight; have often a flaccid, wrinkled\r\nskin, covered with typical syphilitic eruptions, and frequently with\r\ngreat purulent vesicles, especially on the palms of the hands and the\r\nsoles of the feet (“pemphigus syphiliticus”); the internal organs also,\r\nthe spleen, the liver, and the bones, exhibit morbid changes.\r\nCharacteristic is the syphilitic affection of the upper air-passages,\r\nespecially the syphilitic “cold in the head” (=syphilitic\r\nrhinitis=--“snuffles”), of new-born congenitally syphilitic children.\r\nCongenital syphilis further gives rise to severe =disturbances of\r\ndevelopment= and to phenomena to which Fournier has given the name of\r\n“=late syphilis=” (“syphilis hereditaria tarda”), because they first\r\nmake their appearance in the later years of life.[323] Permanent\r\n=debility=, =arrest of development=, =stigmata of degeneration=, in the\r\nform of various =malformations=--as, for example, notching of the edge\r\nof the upper central incisor permanent teeth (a symptom first described\r\nby Jonathan Hutchinson), malformations of the nose, the ears, and the\r\npalate, dwarfing, deaf-mutism, malformations of the external and\r\ninternal reproductive organs, rickets,[324] epilepsy, and mental\r\nweakness--are the consequences of congenital syphilis. Tarnowsky,\r\nFournier, and Barthélémy have traced the consequences of congenital\r\nsyphilis into the second and third generation, and so have discovered an\r\nimportant cause of racial degeneration. Syphilis in the grandfather can\r\nstill exercise its disastrous influence in the grandson, and give rise\r\nto the above-mentioned stigmata of degeneration.[325] Indeed, congenital\r\nsyphilis of the second generation often appears with the same severity\r\nas that of the first generation; and, like acquired syphilis, congenital\r\nsyphilis in women can cause a predisposition to miscarriages and\r\nstill-births.\r\n\r\nAccording to statistics obtained by Edmond Fournier, relating to 11,000\r\ncases of syphilis (10,000 men, 1,000 women) from the private practice\r\nof his father, Alfred Fournier, regarding the age at which infection\r\noccurs, it appears that in =men= it most commonly occurs between the\r\nages of twenty and twenty-six years (the maximum number of infections\r\nduring the twenty-third year); in =women=, between the ages of eighteen\r\nand twenty-one; 8 % of syphilitic males and 20 % of syphilitic females\r\nwere infected before the age of twenty years. Syphilis is to a\r\nconsiderable extent at the present day a disease of =inexperienced\r\nyouth=. This fact is important in relation to the problem of prevention\r\nand the problem of enlightenment.[326]\r\n\r\nOf much less importance than syphilis is the purely local =soft\r\nchancre=, or chancroid, which never results in general infection.\r\nChancroid is produced by a specific exciting cause, a chain-forming\r\nbacillus (streptobacillus), _Bacillus ulceris cancrosi_, which is found\r\nin the pus secreted by the ulcer. =One or two days= after infection, a\r\nsmall pustule forms at the site of inoculation, generally on the\r\nexternal genital organs. This pustule soon bursts, and a deeply hollowed\r\nulcer makes its appearance, which usually undergoes rapid increase, and\r\nfrequently, owing to the infective character of the pus, gives rise to\r\nnew chancres in the neighbourhood of the original one, so that the soft\r\nchancre is commonly multiple. When suitably treated with antiseptic\r\npowders and cauterization, chancroid usually heals quickly; there are,\r\nhowever, very dangerous varieties of chancroid--for instance, the\r\n=serpiginous= chancre, which continues to creep irresistibly forward;\r\nand the =phagedænic= or =gangrenous= chancre, which puts the skill of\r\nthe physician to the utmost test. A less dangerous but extremely\r\ndisagreeable complication of chancroid is inflammation of the inguinal\r\nglands, most commonly only on one side; this painful “bubo” (painful in\r\ncontrast with the painless syphilitic bubo) has a well-marked tendency\r\nto suppuration. If this occurs, and the pus finds its way to the\r\nsurface, fistulas and new chancrous ulcers are liable to occur at the\r\nplace where it opens. By rest in bed, the inunction of iodide ointment,\r\nthe application of cold compresses, the injection into the bubo of a\r\nsolution of nitrate of silver, and the internal use of iodide of\r\npotassium, this unfortunate course may be prevented.\r\n\r\nA remarkable =change of views= has, in the course of the last thirty\r\nyears, taken place in respect of the nature and importance of\r\n=gonorrhœa=.[327] Whereas formerly this was regarded as a comparatively\r\nharmless disease, we know to-day that gonorrhœa in the male, and still\r\nmore in the female, gives rise to tedious dangers and painful morbid\r\nphenomena, and is the source of unspeakable sorrows, and of the\r\nmiserable ill-health of numerous women, and that it is the chief cause\r\nof =sterility= in both sexes.\r\n\r\nGonorrhœa is principally a =disease of the mucous membrane=, and is, in\r\nthis way, distinguished from syphilis, which is a general disorder,\r\ndiffusing itself by way of the bloodvessels. In rare cases, indeed,\r\ngonorrhœa can exhibit general morbid manifestations, the so-called\r\n=gonorrhœal rheumatism=, gonorrhœal affections of the spinal cord and of\r\nthe heart, and gonorrhœal nervous troubles, all of which are so rare,\r\nthat for practical purposes they can be left out of consideration.\r\n\r\nThe typical seat of gonorrhœa is the =mucous membrane of the urinary and\r\nthe genital organs= of the male and the female; in the male affecting\r\n=chiefly= the urinary organs, and in the female affecting chiefly the\r\ngenital organs. The cause of =genuine= gonorrhœa is always infection,\r\nthe transmission from one human being to another of the purulent\r\ninflammation produced by the =gonococcus= discovered by Neisser in 1879.\r\n=Simple urethral inflammations= with a purulent discharge also occur in\r\nwhich no gonococci are found. These arise also from infection, but their\r\nactual exciting cause has not yet been discovered. Not less obscure is\r\nthe relationship of many of the irritants giving rise to simple urethral\r\ncatarrh--for example, that which is active during menstruation--to the\r\nsupposed exciting cause. In any case, these simple catarrhs have a very\r\nmild course, and undergo a cure after a few days or weeks, spontaneously\r\nor as a result of treatment with mild injections.\r\n\r\nQuite otherwise is it with genuine gonorrhœa. In the male it begins from\r\ntwo to six days after the infective intercourse, with a burning\r\nsensation on passing water, itching at the urethral orifice, which very\r\neasily becomes reddened, and this is soon followed by the discharge,\r\neither spontaneously or as a result of pressure on the urethra, of a\r\nthick fluid, at first mucous, later purulent, and then of a yellow or a\r\ngreenish colour. Inflammation, discharge, and pain, the latter\r\nespecially in association with urination, increase during the subsequent\r\nweeks; in addition, in a good many cases there are slight fever,\r\nlassitude, and mental depression, and the patient is tormented,\r\nespecially during the night, by violent, painful erections. In\r\nexceptional cases there are hæmorrhages from the urethra (the so-called\r\n“=Russian clap=”). In some cases the disease terminates favourably; this\r\nis especially observed after the first attack of gonorrhœa. As early as\r\nthe third week the above symptoms become less severe, and in the fourth\r\nor sixth week after infection the whole morbid process may come to an\r\nend, the discharge ceases, the urine becomes clear once more, and, in\r\nfact, definite cure of the gonorrhœa ensues.\r\n\r\nBut the number of those who are so fortunate is comparatively small. In\r\nthe majority of cases, there are other morbid phenomena and\r\ncomplications; the gonorrhœa becomes “=subacute=,” and later\r\n“=chronic=.” Ricord wrote many years ago: “When anyone has once acquired\r\ngonorrhœa, God only knows when he will get well again!” Happily, this\r\npessimism is no longer fully justified at the present day; but it is a\r\nfact that in the majority of cases =even to-day= gonorrhœa is a very\r\nobstinate, wearisome illness, a long-continued burden, not only for the\r\npatient, but also for the doctor. The gonococci proliferate in the\r\ndeeper layers of the mucous membrane, and pass upwards into the\r\n=posterior= part of the urethra, this latter migration being manifested\r\nespecially by frequent and painful =strangury=; further, the =bladder=,\r\nthe =prostate gland=, and the =epididymis= may be attacked. Bilateral\r\nepididymitis has often serious consequences as regards the procreative\r\ncapacity. In about 50 % of the cases incapacity for fertilization\r\n(impotentia generandi) has resulted.\r\n\r\nIf the gonorrhœa becomes chronic, thickenings occur in isolated portions\r\nof the urethral mucous membrane; the urine remains turbid for a long\r\ntime; the discharge, it is true, becomes scantier, but shows itself with\r\nthe most annoying persistency every morning as soon as the patient\r\nleaves his bed, in the form of the so-called =“bon jour” drops= in the\r\nmeatus; there are also troubles connected with the prostate (painful\r\nsensations, especially during defæcation), and symptoms of stricture of\r\nthe urethra may occur. Very often, also, relative impotence and severe\r\nsexual neurasthenia are observed, as consequences of chronic gonorrhœa.\r\nWorst of all is the =long duration of the infectivity=. There is always\r\nthe danger that somewhere or other some gonococci may remain hidden,\r\nand, given an opportunity, may start the process all over again, or may\r\ntransmit the infection to another person. Zweifel reports a case in\r\nwhich a man actually infected a woman thirteen years after he had first\r\nacquired gonorrhœa!\r\n\r\nThe infection of a woman with gonorrhœa, as we know to-day, is a\r\ndisaster. It is the immortal service of the German-American physician\r\nNoeggerath that, in the year 1872, he proved that the majority of the\r\nstubborn “=diseases of women=” were nothing more than the consequences\r\nof gonorrhœal infection. Gonorrhœa selects by preference the internal\r\nreproductive organs of woman; upon the extensive mucous membranes of\r\nthese organs the gonococci find the most favourable conditions for their\r\npersistent life; they find a thousand out-of-the-way comers and\r\nhiding-places, where they can elude the therapeutic activity of the\r\nphysician.\r\n\r\n  “They grow luxuriantly, like a weed which it has not been possible to\r\n  uproot, over the entire surface of the genital mucous membrane,\r\n  attacking with the same vigour the mucous membrane of the uterus and\r\n  that of the Fallopian tubes. In women, as in men, they induce\r\n  ulceration, they cause adhesions, and they give rise to sterility. But\r\n  in the case of women, something further must be added--that, namely,\r\n  this disease has upon them a miserably depressing effect, and that, in\r\n  contradistinction from men, they are likely to suffer for many years\r\n  from intense pains. Whenever they execute certain bodily movements, it\r\n  may be during ten years in succession, they experience pains, often\r\n  horribly severe, and in most cases they are condemned to a life of\r\n  deprivation and misery--not usually for any fault of their own, since\r\n  most women are infected by their husbands” (Zweifel).\r\n\r\nGonorrhœa in women, attacking successively the vagina, the uterus, the\r\nFallopian tubes, the ovaries, and the peritoneum, is a true martyrdom, a\r\nhell upon earth. Sick in body and in mind, these unhappy women drag out\r\na miserable existence; and to them so often the last consolation, that\r\nof motherhood, is denied, for gonorrhœa is the most frequent cause of\r\nsterility in woman.\r\n\r\nPatients infected with gonorrhœa further run the danger of =blindness=,\r\nby transference of the gonorrhœal virus to the =eye=. This is one of the\r\nmost distressing of the possible results of the disease. New-born\r\nchildren whose mothers are infected with gonorrhœa are during birth\r\nexposed to the same danger of eye infection, as they pass down the\r\ngenital passage. In earlier days a very large proportion of the blind\r\nwere persons who had lost their sight in this way very shortly after\r\nbirth. Since Crédé advocated the admirable method of introducing nitrate\r\nof silver solution into the conjunctival sacs of new-born children,\r\ngonorrhœal inflammation of the eye has become one of the greatest\r\nrarities.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nVENEREAL DISEASES IN THE HOMOSEXUAL\r\n\r\nIt is an old belief, shared by the homosexual themselves, that venereal\r\ninfections are extremely rare among them. If male homosexual persons had\r\nsexual intercourse =only with one another=, this assumption would be in\r\nsome degree plausible. For the principal focus of venereal infection is\r\nfeminine prostitution, by which venereal diseases are transmitted to\r\nheterosexual men. But since these homosexual men often undertake sexual\r\nacts with heterosexual men--apart from occasional sexual intercourse\r\nwith women--a priori there is a possibility of infection in their case,\r\nand such infection is, in fact, observed. Above all, many male\r\nprostitutes also indulge in intercourse with women, and thus diffuse\r\nvenereal troubles among homosexual men.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that =syphilis= can be diffused among the homosexual as\r\neasily as among the heterosexual, for syphilis is transmitted by many\r\nvarieties of contact--by kisses, other caresses, etc. But how is it as\r\nregards =gonorrhœa=?\r\n\r\nIn the case of heterosexual men and women gonorrhœa is almost\r\nexclusively transmitted by the sexual act, by the introduction of the\r\nmale penis into the female vagina. The analogous act between men--that\r\nis to say, pæderasty, _immissio penis in anum_--is unquestionably far\r\n=rarer= than the ordinary sexual act between men and women; it is\r\ncommonly replaced by mutual onanism, by kisses and other caresses, and\r\nquite frequently by _coitus in os_. This last is much commoner than\r\ngenuine pædication. Of gonorrhœa of the rectum produced by pædication\r\nwhen the active man is suffering from gonorrhœa, we very rarely hear.\r\nBut is there, in the case of homosexual men, any possibility of\r\ngonorrhœal infection due to _coitus in os_?\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that typical =gonorrhœa of the mouth= occurs. The\r\nobservations of Kuttler, Atkinson, Rosinski, Dohrn, and Kast, have\r\nproved it.[328] Horand and Cazenave have even observed gonorrhœal\r\ninfection of the urethra as a result of oral coitus![329] A homosexual\r\npatient told me that some years before, after _coitus in os_ with a man,\r\nhe had for several weeks had a discharge from the urethra, which\r\nspontaneously ceased, and therefore cannot have been genuine gonorrhœa,\r\nbut only urethritis resulting from infection by contagious angina. In\r\nthe case in question, the urethral catarrh was certainly due to the\r\n_coitus in os_, since any other sources of infection could be excluded.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in a second case an apparently =gonorrhœal infection\r\nof the oral cavity= was transmitted from the urethra.\r\n\r\n  A homosexual man, forty-five years of age, one day allowed a\r\n  =heterosexual= man to perform _coitus in os_ on him. Some days\r\n  afterwards he experienced difficulty in swallowing, was feverish, and\r\n  saw in the looking-glass that the uvula was swollen. A specialist for\r\n  throat troubles diagnosed merely a catarrhal infection. The illness\r\n  became worse, and a second throat specialist detected the presence of\r\n  a purulent angina of both tonsils, ordered painting with argentamin,\r\n  also vapour baths, and an astringent gargle, whereupon the affection\r\n  gradually subsided. Six weeks later the patient had swelling and pain\r\n  in the joints of the right knee and foot; under cold compresses these\r\n  swellings subsided after a fortnight. Of the whole trouble nothing now\r\n  remains.\r\n\r\nThis description, on the part of a patient who is thoroughly\r\ntrustworthy, aroused strong suspicion of a =gonorrhœal angina=, with a\r\nconsecutive gonorrhœal arthritis. Unfortunately, the purulent discharge\r\nfrom the tonsils was not examined for gonococci by either of the\r\nphysicians in attendance. The case remains, anyhow, very remarkable.\r\n\r\nIn the case of homosexual women, it is obvious that syphilis, and also\r\ngonorrhœa, can be transmitted, the latter by mutual friction of the\r\ngenital organs. I do not know what actually occurs in practice.\r\n\r\n  [312] _Cf._ Iwan Bloch, “Schopenhauer’s Illness in the Year 1823. A\r\n  Contribution to Pathography based upon an Unpublished Document.”\r\n  Published in _Medizinische Klinik_, 1906, Nos. 25 and 26. (This gives\r\n  an account of all Schopenhauer’s utterances regarding syphilis.)\r\n\r\n  [313] At a meeting of the Société d’Anthropologie de Paris, held on\r\n  April 19, 1906, I read a paper on “La Syphilis Prétendue\r\n  Préhistorique,” in which I discussed this question. The important\r\n  question of ancient bones is further considered in the second volume\r\n  of my work on “The Origin of Syphilis,” pp. 317-364 (now in the\r\n  press).\r\n\r\n  [314] The results of this study I have briefly epitomized in an\r\n  address given before the Social Science Congress in Berlin, entitled\r\n  “The First Appearance of Syphilis in Europe” (Jena, 1904).\r\n\r\n  [315] Regarding the gradual acquirement (by means of natural\r\n  selection) of immunity to epidemic diseases, the works of Archdall\r\n  Reid may be most profitably consulted (“The Present Evolution of Man,”\r\n  London, 1896; “The Principles of Heredity,” London, 1905). Dr. Reid’s\r\n  views on the part played in human history by the transference of\r\n  diseases from immunized to non-immunized races are of especial\r\n  interest. Unfortunately, as regards syphilis, he accepts Hirsch’s\r\n  erroneous statements relative to the antiquity of that disease, and\r\n  its origin in the eastern hemisphere (see also p. 384, note\r\n  ^{346}).--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n  [316] _Cf._ A. Neisser, “The Experimental Investigation of Syphilis as\r\n  it Stands at the Present Day” (Berlin, 1906).\r\n\r\n  [317] _Cf._ Erich Hoffmann, “The Etiology of Syphilis” (Berlin, 1906);\r\n  Hans Hübner, “Recent Researches into the Nature of Syphilis,”\r\n  published in the _Journal for the Suppression of Venereal Diseases_,\r\n  1906, vol. v., pp. 468-481.\r\n\r\n  [318] I must not omit allusion to some recent admirable works on\r\n  venereal diseases: A. Blaschko, “Venereal Diseases”--a popular\r\n  exposition--(Berlin, 1904); Paul Zweifel, “Venereal Diseases and their\r\n  Importance to Health” (Leipzig, 1902); Alfred Fournier, “Syphilis a\r\n  Social Danger”; Karl Ries, “Blameless Sexual Infection” (Stuttgart,\r\n  1904); O. Burwinkel, “Venereal Diseases” (Leipzig, 1905); Waldvogel,\r\n  “The Dangers of Venereal Diseases and their Prevention” (Stuttgart,\r\n  1905). In view of the large number of popular works on venereal\r\n  diseases, those without professional knowledge should confine\r\n  themselves to the best names, because in this province trashy\r\n  literature is extraordinarily abundant, and by the false and erroneous\r\n  views it diffuses, it does much more harm than good. The writings\r\n  mentioned in this note I am able to recommend as thoroughly scientific\r\n  and =trustworthy=.\r\n\r\n  [319] Galewsky, “The Transmission of Venereal Diseases in the Suckling\r\n  of Children,” published in the _Journal for the Suppression of\r\n  Venereal Diseases_, 1906, vol. v., pp. 365-371.\r\n\r\n  [320] It is true that such a hardening may also occur in other\r\n  non-syphilitic affections of the genital organs--for example, when\r\n  they are peculiarly situated or as a result of cauterization. Only the\r\n  physician can determine whether in such a case syphilitic infection\r\n  has actually occurred.\r\n\r\n  [321, 322] According to English experience, the congenitally\r\n  syphilitic child rarely exhibits any sign of syphilis when born. Thus,\r\n  Hutchinson writes (“Syphilis,” p. 73): “At the time of birth, the\r\n  congenitally syphilitic infant almost invariably has a clear skin, and\r\n  appears to be in perfect health.” According to Osler also (“Medicine,”\r\n  sixth edition, p. 269): “The child may be born healthy-looking or with\r\n  well-marked evidence of the disease. In the majority of instances the\r\n  former is the case, and within the first month or two the signs of the\r\n  disease appear.”--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n  [323] _Cf._ the recently published admirable work of Edmond Fournier,\r\n  “Recherches et Diagnostic de l’Hérédo-Syphilis Tardive” (Paris, 1907).\r\n\r\n  [324] Parrot regarded rickets as a manifestation of congenital\r\n  syphilis, but this view has never found acceptance in England.\r\n  Hutchinson remarks (“Syphilis,” p. 408): “The typical forms of rickets\r\n  are constantly met with in conditions which do not lend the slightest\r\n  support to the suggestion of syphilis.” As Cheadle remarks: “Syphilis\r\n  modifies rickets; it does not create it.”--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n  [325] This view must be accepted with reserve. See, for instance,\r\n  Osler’s “Medicine,” sixth edition, p. 271: “Is syphilis transmitted to\r\n  the third generation? The general opinion is opposed to this view.\r\n  Occasionally, however, cases of pronounced congenital syphilis are met\r\n  with in the children of parents who are perfectly healthy, and who\r\n  have not, so far as is known, had syphilis, and yet, as remarked by\r\n  Coutts, who reported such a group of cases, they do not bear careful\r\n  scrutiny. The existing difference of opinion is well illustrated in\r\n  the account by G. Boeck (_Berl. Klin. Wochenschrift_, September 12,\r\n  1904) of four instances of hereditary lues in the second generation,\r\n  while in the same journal Jonathan Hutchinson expresses his belief\r\n  that syphilis is not transmitted to the third\r\n  generation.”--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n  [326] As more important scientific works on syphilis I must mention\r\n  that of Isidor Neumann (Vienna, 1899, second edition), containing the\r\n  entire bibliography of the subject; that of Joseph Lang (Wiesbaden,\r\n  1896, second edition); but, above all, the epoch-making work of Alfred\r\n  Fournier, “Traité de Syphilis” (Paris, 1898)--English translation,\r\n  Fournier, “The Treatment and Prophylaxis of Syphilis” (Rebman Ltd.,\r\n  London, 1906).\r\n\r\n  [327] The most important scientific work on gonorrhœa is that of\r\n  Ernest Finger, “Blennorrhœa of the Sexual Organs,” fifth edition\r\n  (Leipzig and Vienna, 1901).\r\n\r\n  [328] _Cf._ M. von Zeissl, “Diagnosis and Treatment of Venereal\r\n  Diseases,” third edition, pp. 171, 172 (Berlin and Vienna, 1905).\r\n\r\n  [329] _Op cit._, p. 172.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nPROPHYLAXIS, TREATMENT, AND SUPPRESSION (BEKÄMPFUNG) OF VENEREAL\r\nDISEASES\r\n\r\n\r\n  “_The friend of humanity may with some confidence anticipate a gradual\r\n  diminution in the prevalence of venereal diseases, and may hope for\r\n  their complete extinction in a not too distant future.

F. H. Marx, who is well known to have been the\r\nphysician of Heinrich Heine during the latter’s student life in\r\nGöttingen. The title of this essay is “The Diminution of Diseases in\r\nConsequence of Advancing Civilization,” p. 35 (Göttingen, 1844).\r\n\r\nThe hopeful view which is here expressed by the university professor\r\nregarding the ultimate eradication of venereal diseases was shared at\r\nthat time by the eminently =practical physician= Parent-Duchatelet. He\r\nappeals, unfortunately, not to medical men and students of social\r\nhygiene, but to the police:\r\n\r\n  “Pursue without cessation the diseases which are diffused by means of\r\n  prostitutes; =take it as your goal to cause them to disappear from the\r\n  list of human troubles; do not doubt that your labours will ultimately\r\n  be crowned with success, although the task may be one that will occupy\r\n  several generations=.”[331]\r\n\r\nTwo complete generations had, however, to pass away before =the campaign\r\nagainst venereal diseases and the attempt to suppress them became a\r\nburning question of the time=, became a question of =public health= and\r\nsocial hygiene, like those which concern the fight with tuberculosis,\r\nwith infant mortality, and with alcoholism. Once again I must repeat\r\nthat the =organized systematic campaign against venereal diseases is\r\nstill in its very earliest stages=. Strictly speaking, it dates only\r\nfrom seven years ago, when the =first international congress for the\r\nprophylaxis of syphilis and other venereal diseases= was held in\r\nBrussels, from September 4 to 8, 1899. Almost all the civilized\r\ncountries, European and other, took part in this congress, and not only\r\nphysicians and dermatologists, but also lawyers, clergymen, attachés of\r\nembassies, authors, and philanthropists, explained their views, and\r\nthereby showed that the question of the suppression of venereal diseases\r\nwas one of equal interest to all classes of society, and one which must\r\nexercise the activity of the community at large. At the conclusion of\r\nthis first international conference in 1899, there was founded the\r\n=International Society for the Sanitary and Moral Prophylaxis of\r\nSyphilis and other Venereal Diseases=, which has its seat in Brussels,\r\nand meets at periodical intervals for international conferences.\r\n\r\nEspecially in Germany has this organization aroused active interest, and\r\nit was soon decided to found a national =German Society for the\r\nSuppression of Venereal Diseases=, whose first meeting was held on\r\nOctober 19, 1903, in the hall of the Berlin Rathaus. The meeting was\r\nopened by a speech from Albert Neisser, after which Alfred Blaschko\r\nspoke on “The Diffusion of Venereal Diseases,” Edmund Lesser on “The\r\nDangers of Venereal Diseases,” Martin Kirchner on “The Social Importance\r\nof Venereal Diseases,” and Albert Neisser on “The Aims of the German\r\nSociety for the Suppression of Venereal Diseases.” The =committee= of\r\nthe Society consists of Messrs. A. Neisser, president; E. Lesser,\r\nvice-president and treasurer; and A. Blaschko, general secretary. The\r\norgan of the Society is issued six times yearly, under the title,\r\n_Reports of the German Society for the Suppression of Venereal\r\nDiseases_, and has been published for the last four years; it is\r\nsupplied gratis to members; to non-members the yearly subscription is\r\nonly three marks. In the spring of the year 1903 there was founded a\r\nlarger _Journal for the Suppression of Venereal Diseases_, of which five\r\nvolumes have hitherto appeared; this serves for the publication of more\r\ncomprehensive critical studies.\r\n\r\nStill in the same year, 1902, there were formed the first =branches= and\r\n=local groups= of the German Society for the Suppression of Venereal\r\nDiseases in Hanover, Wiesbaden, Breslau, and Berlin. Subsequently other\r\nbranches were formed in Mannheim, Munich, Cologne, Beuthen, Danzig,\r\nStettin, Posen, Dortmund, Elberfeld, Frankfurt-on-the-Main, Görlitz,\r\nHamburg, Königsberg, Nürnberg, Stuttgart, and Heidelberg.\r\n\r\nDuring the last four years, by means of lectures, the circulation of\r\npamphlets and leaflets, and by public discussions, information regarding\r\nthe dangers of venereal diseases has been diffused among the widest\r\ncircles of the population. Of the other activities and measures of the\r\nSociety we shall have to speak later.\r\n\r\nWe pass on to the consideration of the principal elements of the modern\r\ncampaign against venereal diseases. In view of the limits of this work\r\nour discussion of this question must necessarily be a brief one. The\r\neradication of venereal diseases must be effected in a =threefold=\r\nmanner:\r\n\r\n1. By measures of =personal prophylaxis= against infection.\r\n\r\n2. By the proper =medical treatment= of all cases of venereal disease.\r\n\r\n3. By measures belonging to the province of =public hygiene=, to that of\r\n=state action=, and to that of =education=.\r\n\r\nThe =personal prophylaxis= of venereal diseases[332] has made great\r\nprogress with the increasing scientific knowledge of the causes and\r\nmodes of infection of these diseases. We know now precisely where and\r\nhow we can lay down =personal= rules which give us at least a =fairly\r\nsecure guarantee= that in an individual case venereal infection will not\r\noccur. Various points of view must then be taken into consideration, the\r\ncombined influence of which will alone promise a successful result. No\r\none single measure will suffice to gain this end.\r\n\r\nAbove all, in this department of the prophylaxis of venereal diseases,\r\nexperienced physicians, alike of earlier and more recent times, will\r\nunanimously agree in this proposition, that the principal preliminary\r\nmeans for the avoidance of venereal infection, means which it is\r\nabsolutely essential to employ in every instance, consist of =perfect\r\ncleanliness= on both sides. He who insists on the most scrupulous\r\ncleanliness of body, clothing, and underclothing, will be sure to get\r\nrid =immediately= of any uncleanliness acquired in sexual intercourse.\r\nCleanliness and health are often (not always) identical. In any case,\r\nthe =greatest mistrust= should be felt as regards a person evidently\r\nunclean, with a neglected exterior, for this is always a sign that such\r\na person is not particular as regards choice in matters of sexual\r\nintercourse. “=Germany, get into your bath!=” Heinrich Laube once\r\nexclaimed. This would be a good device to adopt in the campaign against\r\nvenereal diseases. Every uncleanliness is an irritant; it impairs the\r\nintactness of the skin; and especially is this true of any uncleanliness\r\nof the genital organs, and above all of the male genital organs, where,\r\nunder the foreskin, the “smegma” (the sebaceous secretion of the\r\npreputial glands) often undergoes decomposition, and gives rise to an\r\ninflammation, the so-called =balanitis=, which greatly favours the\r\nprobability of infection.[333]\r\n\r\nIf the foreskin has been removed by circumcision, this secretion\r\nentirely ceases, and the mucous membrane covering the glans penis is\r\ntransformed into a thick skin, which is much less readily affected by\r\nthe causes of infection. There is no doubt that circumcision is to a\r\ncertain extent a protective measure against syphilitic infection, whilst\r\nit does not in any way protect against gonorrhœa. Neustätter has\r\nrecently collected some very remarkable facts relating to this\r\nquestion.[334]\r\n\r\nBreitenstein has contrasted 15,000 indigenous =circumcised= soldiers\r\nwith 18,000 =uncircumcised= European soldiers of the army of the Dutch\r\nIndies, living under similar local and hygienic conditions. Thus, in the\r\nyear 1895 there were infected with venereal diseases, of the circumcised\r\n16 %, of the uncircumcised 41 %. As regards infections with syphilis, of\r\nthe circumcised 0·8 % were infected; of the uncircumcised, on the other\r\nhand, 4·1 %--that is, five times as many. Similar observations were made\r\nby the celebrated English syphilologist Jonathan Hutchinson, one of the\r\nmost ardent advocates of the general introduction of circumcision as a\r\nprotective measure against venereal, and above all against syphilitic,\r\ninfection. Moreover, with regard to the observations made in Java, the\r\ndifference did not depend upon race, because similar differences have\r\nbeen observed as regards comparative immunity from infection in respect\r\nof circumcised Christians, circumcised on account of phimosis and other\r\ntroubles, whose number is by no means insignificant.\r\n\r\nSince, however, it is unlikely that circumcision will come into general\r\nuse in Europe as a prophylactic measure, it only remains to recommend\r\nthat, as a fundamental procedure, the greatest possible care should be\r\nemployed in the daily and delicate cleansing of the preputial sac. By\r\nthis means inflammation and laceration of these parts will be most\r\neffectually prevented, and even without circumcision a certain resisting\r\npower will be induced. For washing this region, lukewarm water which has\r\nbeen boiled and cooled may best be employed; then dry the part\r\ncarefully, so as not to rub off the skin. In the case of women,\r\nfrequent washings of the external genital organs, and vaginal douches,\r\nare also of great importance in regard to the prevention of venereal\r\ninfection. =Before= and =after= the sexual act, these measures are of\r\nespecial value, because =often by simple mechanical means=, infective\r\nmaterial already deposited may be carried away. The same purpose is\r\nsubserved by urination, a procedure certainly adapted for washing out\r\ngonorrhœal pus which has found its way into the urethra, before the\r\ngonococci have had time to establish themselves in the mucous membrane.\r\nI know a number of patients who =use no other means of protection in\r\nsexual intercourse beyond the observation of extreme cleanliness, by\r\nwashing and douching, in both sexes=, before and after sexual\r\nintercourse, and by passing water immediately after intercourse, and\r\nthus have remained free from infection; but who promptly became infected\r\n=as soon as they discontinued these simple measures=.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, these measures, where possible with the assistance of\r\n=soap=, which certainly exercises some antiseptic influence, cannot be\r\ntoo warmly recommended, although they naturally =do not offer any\r\nabsolute security=. They have, however, the advantage that, in the first\r\nplace, they can always be employed, even when the true protective\r\nmeasures of which we speak below are not available, and that, in the\r\nsecond place, they can always be used in addition to these. It sounds,\r\nperhaps, somewhat absurd, and yet it is true, to say that =washing= and\r\n=urination= are the =first= and =most important= protective measures\r\nagainst sexual infection.\r\n\r\nThe second point, which must also be considered important in this\r\nconnexion, is the =exercise of self-command= before and during the\r\nsexual act, as far as this is possible in view of the nature of sexual\r\nexcitement, which always lessens the personal responsibility, and\r\novercomes reason and understanding. Yet no one should have sexual\r\nintercourse when =in a state of alcoholic intoxication=, in which\r\nself-control is =completely= lost; as we have shown in an earlier\r\npassage (pp. 292-296), there are several reasons why intercourse is apt\r\nto be disastrous to a drunken man. Moreover, =love= prefers the dark,\r\nbut =precaution= prefers =the sunlight=. Before having intercourse with\r\na woman previously unknown to him, a man should inspect her in clear\r\ndaylight, with a view to her state of health. Suspicious spots on the\r\nskin, especially on the forehead and on the trunk; white areas on the\r\nlips, the tongue, the throat, and the back of the neck; visible\r\nglandular swellings; a marked discharge from the genital organs;\r\nulcerated areas in this region, etc., are of an extremely suspicious\r\nnature, and should cause abstinence from intercourse. French physicians\r\ngo so far as to recommend examination of the inguinal and cervical\r\nglands under the harmless form of pretended caresses; but persons\r\nwithout medical education would seldom be sufficiently skilled to be\r\nable to detect glandular swellings unless these were unusually well\r\ndeveloped. Especially enlargement of the cervical glands--this “pulse of\r\nsyphilis,” as Alfred Fournier terms it--is a comparatively certain\r\nindication of syphilis.\r\n\r\nIt is dangerous also in many cases to repeat the sexual act =several\r\ntimes= in brief succession, because old experience has taught us that\r\ninfective material may first make its appearance at the second or third\r\nact of coitus, and thus infect then only. This affords an explanation\r\nalso of a fact often observed--that in intercourse with an infected\r\nwoman on the part of two healthy men, with but a brief interval between\r\nthe acts, the one who had intercourse first often remains healthy,\r\nwhilst the second is infected.\r\n\r\nI pass on to consider the =special protective measures= which have long\r\nbeen recommended for the prophylaxis of venereal infection.\r\n\r\n1. =The Condom.=--This is the =oldest= and even to-day beyond question\r\nthe best and =most trustworthy= artificial protective measure. Employed\r\nlong ago in the days of antiquity, it was in the sixteenth century once\r\nmore recommended by the Italian physician Fallopius, and therefore is\r\nnot the invention of a physician “Conton,” after whom it is said to have\r\nbeen named (perhaps the name is connected with that of the French town\r\n“Condom”). Hans Ferdy (A. Meyerhof) suggests that the word is derived\r\nfrom “condus”--that is, one who =preserves= or protects--and that the\r\narticle should properly be called “condus” instead of “condom.”[335]\r\n\r\nThe condom is a protective membrane, with which the penis is covered\r\nbefore intercourse. We distinguish as “=rubber condoms=” those made of\r\nrubber, gutta-percha, or caoutchouc; and as “=cæcal condoms=” those made\r\nout of the cæcal mucous membrane of the goat or sheep (incorrectly\r\ntermed also “isinglass condoms”). The cæcal condom is thinner and more\r\ndelicate, and blunts sensation less, than the rubber condom. The rubber\r\ncondom, however, is more =trustworthy=, in respect of durability and its\r\nslighter liability to laceration, if the little precaution is not\r\nneglected to keep it in a cool place, and to protect it from the\r\nlong-continued influence of warmth. The habit of carrying about a rubber\r\ncondom in the pocket for a long time favours its rapidly becoming\r\nuntrustworthy and easily torn. Cæcal condoms, on the other hand, very\r\nreadily become fragile and pervious, although the contrary is the common\r\nopinion, and they are preferred to rubber condoms in the belief that the\r\ndearer article must be the better. Advertisement is exceedingly active\r\nin this direction, and every kind of speciality is widely recommended.\r\nIn England condoms are sometimes sold bearing the portrait of some\r\ncelebrated person!\r\n\r\nThe condom is a “=general protective measure=”--that is, it protects\r\nagainst both gonorrhœa and syphilis, in so far as the latter disease, as\r\nis usually the case, is transmitted from the genital organs. All the\r\nleading physicians engaged more especially in the treatment of venereal\r\ndiseases are agreed that the condom, when of good quality, when properly\r\napplied, and when removed with care (for in the removal material\r\nadhering to the outer surface may very readily give rise to infection),\r\nconstitutes the =very best= and =most certain= of all the protective\r\nmeasures hitherto advocated. It is true that it can be used by men only,\r\nbut when used by the man it simultaneously protects the woman from\r\ngonorrhœal infection, and not rarely also from syphilitic infection.\r\n\r\n2. =The Instillation of Solutions of Silver Salts.=[336]--These serve\r\nexclusively for the prophylaxis of gonorrhœa, and are not, therefore,\r\ngeneral protective measures. We owe their introduction to Blokusewski,\r\nwho recommended the use of a =two % solution of nitrate of silver=. More\r\nrecently, the albuminates of silver have been preferred, such as\r\n=protargol= in a 10 to 20 % solution, =albargin= in a 4 to 10 %\r\nsolution, or a solution of 20 % protargol-gelatine. These solutions can\r\nbe carried about in small drop-bottles--for example, as the “Sanitas”\r\n(silver nitrate) of Blokusewski, the “Viro” or the “Phallokos” apparatus\r\n(these are trade names for proprietary preparations--solutions of\r\nprotargol). All solutions of silver salts must be kept in the dark, and\r\nafter the lapse of any considerable time, some freshly prepared solution\r\nmust be introduced, for time and the influence of light destroy their\r\nefficacy. Immediately after intercourse and urination, one or two drops\r\nof the solution are instilled into the urethra, and a drop or two also\r\nallowed to run over the frænum præputii.[337]\r\n\r\nThe views regarding the value of these protective measures are\r\nconflicting. Beyond question, they are less trustworthy than the condom.\r\nInfection has been observed in spite of the use of instillations. Above\r\nall, however, the continued use of these methods gives rise to\r\ndisagreeable =irritative manifestations= in the urethra and may even\r\ncause =catarrhal inflammation=, and thus artificially increase the\r\nliability to infection. Hence, these instillations should be reserved\r\nfor =occasional= use; =habitually=, only the condom should be employed.\r\n\r\n3. =Inunction.=--Whereas the instillation of chemical solutions serves\r\nto protect against gonorrhœa only, the practice recommended for a much\r\nlonger time of =anointing= the penis with a simple fatty material, or\r\nwith an antiseptic ointment, =before= or =after= sexual intercourse,\r\nprotects against syphilis only. It is obvious that a layer of fatty\r\nmaterial covering the penis exercises the purely mechanical function of\r\npreventing the passage of infective matters to the skin. It is, however,\r\nequally obvious that by the to-and-fro friction during sexual\r\nintercourse, especially when this occupies a considerable time, this\r\nfatty covering will be rubbed away, so that the virus can find a means\r\nof entrance. The protection is thus extremely relative. Still, such\r\nauthors as Neisser, Max Joseph, Loeb, and Campagnolle, report favourable\r\nexperiences regarding the prevention of syphilis by the inunction of the\r\npenis, for which purpose simple vaseline, or Schleich’s wax-soap cream,\r\nwhich is sold with the “Viro” apparatus, may be employed. In any case,\r\nthis method is better than nothing at all. He who has no other\r\nprotective measure available should remember that in every house there\r\nis always some fat or ointment obtainable which can be used for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nIn order, whilst using this method, to protect simultaneously against\r\ngonorrhœa, it has been recommended that antiseptic ointment should be\r\ninserted into the urethra before intercourse, but this is a very\r\nunsatisfactory and untrustworthy method.\r\n\r\nWell worth attention is the inunction recently recommended by\r\nMetchnikoff[338] of =a specific mercurial ointment=, after intercourse,\r\nfor the destruction of any syphilitic virus which may have been\r\ndeposited.[339] He used for this purpose, not the strongly irritant blue\r\nointment, but the =white precipitate ointment=, an ointment of the\r\n=salicyl-arseniate of mercury= (=enesol=), and, above all, a =30 %\r\ncalomel ointment=. After any suspicious coitus, this ointment should be\r\nrubbed for four or five minutes into the area of possible infection;\r\nthis should be done without delay; but even after the lapse of eighteen\r\nto twenty-four hours an effect has been traced. The experiments on apes\r\ninoculated with syphilis gave positive results; also in the case of a\r\nstudent of medicine who voluntarily offered himself for inoculation with\r\nthe syphilitic virus, the inunction of calomel ointment appears to have\r\nprevented the outbreak of the disease.\r\n\r\n=In any case, these new methods for the prophylaxis of syphilis demand\r\nthe most careful attention.= Further experience is needed to determine\r\nwhether they deserve general application.\r\n\r\n4. =Antiseptic Washes.=--Washing of the penis and douching of the vagina\r\nwith antiseptic lotions (sublimate, lysol, permanganate of potassium)\r\nafter intercourse are among the most uncertain of protective measures,\r\nbecause the sublimate solution, or whatever may be used, does not find\r\nits way into any possible lacerations; and because, in consequence of\r\nthe profuse secretion of the sebaceous glands of the male and female\r\ngenital organs, these organs are covered with a layer of fatty material,\r\nwhich prevents the contact of watery fluids, but does not in the same\r\ndegree prevent the entrance of the syphilitic poison. Antiseptic washes\r\n=after= the sexual act have as little value as the same used before the\r\nsexual act.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of these protective measures--above all, of those named\r\nunder the first, second, and third headings--ought to be very much more\r\ngeneral than it is. Unfortunately, however, in public life such measures\r\nare still viewed largely from the standpoint of the moralist as\r\n“=indecent=” or “=improper=”; and the criminal law classifies them thus,\r\nso that their =public recommendation= and diffusion is still exposed to\r\ngreat hindrances.\r\n\r\nAt the second congress of the Society for the Suppression of Venereal\r\nDiseases, held in Munich in March, 1905, the question of the public\r\nrecommendation of protective measures was opened to discussion, and was\r\ndealt with in two admirable addresses by O. Neustätter[340] and Georg\r\nBernhard.[341] Bernhard proposed that to Section 184, paragraph 3, of\r\nthe Criminal Code, which declares it to be a punishable offence to\r\n“expose for sale articles intended for an indecent use, or to recommend\r\nor sell such articles to the public,” should be added a =legal\r\ndefinition= in the following sense: =articles which are used either to\r\nprevent venereal diseases or to prevent conception are not regarded as\r\n“intended for an indecent use”=; and Neustätter pleaded for an\r\n=alteration of the existing state of the law=, in the sense that =the\r\npublic recommendation of means for the prevention and cure of venereal\r\ndiseases= should be legally permissible, being restricted merely by\r\ncertain =regulations against quackery, extortion, and other misuse=. The\r\nregulation of the recommendation could best =be associated with the\r\nnecessary control of the recommendation of therapeutic and preventive\r\nmeasures in general. A supreme sanitary authority= should be\r\nconstituted, =part of whose duties= should be to =examine the form and\r\ncontents= of recommendations of this character.\r\n\r\nAnother juristic relationship of the prophylaxis of venereal diseases\r\nconcerns =legal protection against venereal infection=. Franz von\r\nLiszt,[342] von Bar,[343] and Schmölder,[344] opened the discussion on\r\nthe biological and criminal aspects of the prophylaxis of venereal\r\ndiseases at the first congress of the Society for the Suppression of\r\nVenereal Diseases, held at Frankfurt-on-the-Main in the year 1903.\r\n\r\nHitherto the heedless or deliberate transmission of venereal disease was\r\npunishable only as personal injury, since in the Criminal Code there was\r\nno paragraph directly relating to this matter. Only in the Criminal Code\r\nof Oldenburg of 1884 was such punishment expressly provided for (Article\r\n387), and by this provision =the intercourse of an infected person with\r\na healthy one was punishable, without regard to the subsequent\r\ninfection=. In the legal regulations of other countries than Germany, we\r\nfind several instances in which the witting transmission of venereal\r\ninfection by means of sexual intercourse is punishable. In Germany a\r\nmeasure proposing this was rejected by the Reichstag in 1900. Von Liszt\r\nadvocated the introduction of the following paragraph into the Criminal\r\nCode:\r\n\r\n  “One who, being aware that he is suffering from a contagious venereal\r\n  disorder, performs coitus, or in any other way exposes another human\r\n  being to the danger of infection, shall be punished with imprisonment\r\n  for a term of two to three years, and in addition shall be deprived of\r\n  civil rights.”\r\n\r\nSchmölder enlarged this clause by an amendment relating to the\r\npunishment of prostitutes disseminating venereal diseases.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, von Bar drew attention to the inconveniences and\r\ndangers which a punishment of this nature would involve, especially to\r\nthe dangers of =blackmail=, and to the =duty it would impose on\r\nphysicians= of breaking their obligations of professional secrecy.\r\nMoreover, a proof of the =knowledge= of venereal infection is difficult\r\nto obtain; the proof that infection is derived from a definite person is\r\nalso far from easy. Von Bar opposed the addition of such a clause on\r\nthis and other grounds. In the discussion upon the motion, this view was\r\nshared by C. Fränkel, Ries, Oppenheimer, and others; Neisser was in\r\nfavour of a punishment of this kind, because then, at any rate, there\r\nwould be a public recognition of the fact that such an action was open\r\nto severe =punishment=, and was a =disgraceful= one; thus, by the mere\r\nexistence of the paragraph an =educative influence= would be exerted.\r\n\r\nIn any case, such a punishment would be a two-edged weapon, and as far\r\nas present necessity goes, we have sufficient powers in the application\r\nto such offences of the paragraphs of the Criminal Code relating to\r\nbodily injury.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe second great means for the limitation and entire suppression of\r\nvenereal diseases is =to deal with them by medical treatment, to cure as\r\nspeedily as possible persons suffering from syphilis of gonorrhœa, and\r\nthus to prevent these persons from becoming sources of fresh infection.\r\nSystematic, methodical treatment on a large scale=--that is the =goal=\r\nat which we have to aim. To the poor man or woman suffering from\r\nvenereal infection the same advantages should be opened as to the\r\nwealthy voluptuary. The provision of means of treatment of venereal\r\ndiseases =cannot be too free=. In public hospitals, private clinics,\r\nambulatoria, and sanatoria, in convalescent homes, and polyclinics for\r\nprostitutes, everywhere must be provided means for an intelligent\r\ntreatment of venereal diseases. Just as tuberculosis is now attacked\r\nsystematically and vigorously, so must it be with venereal diseases.\r\n\r\nSince =syphilis= constitutes only about 25 %--only one-fourth part, that\r\nis to say--of venereal diseases in general, since also during the last\r\nfour centuries the disease has shown a natural tendency to decline in\r\nvirulence, since a mitigation in the intensity of the virus is clearly\r\nrecognizable, it is in the case of this disease that the =hope of\r\nradical success= is especially great.\r\n\r\nOur forefathers carried out for us a great part of the campaign against\r\nsyphilis. The =comparatively mild= course of syphilis in the majority of\r\nuncomplicated cases leads us to infer that there has been a relative\r\nimmunization against syphilitic poison.\r\n\r\nAlbert Reibmayr remarks that “=during the last 400 years, every human\r\nbeing now living in Europe has had about 4,000 ancestors; of these,\r\nhowever disagreeable the fact may seem, a considerable number must have\r\nhad to contend with syphilis=.”[345]\r\n\r\nBut this undoubted fact, that =all of us= have been to a certain extent\r\n“=syphilized=,”[346] plays its part to our advantage in the campaign\r\nagainst syphilis--that campaign which our own time has taken up with\r\njoyful hope of success.\r\n\r\nAbove all, let honour be paid to the ever youthful and fresh master and\r\nNestor of European research into the subject of syphilis, Alfred\r\nFournier, the evening of whose life is devoted to the campaign against\r\nsyphilis as a “social danger.” To the great scientific works of his life\r\nhe has now added the small, but not less valuable, =explanatory\r\nwritings=, which are being sold at a low price all over France, and in\r\npart also have already been translated into German and English.[347]\r\nTheir aim is to get the =people= on our side in the campaign against\r\nsyphilis.\r\n\r\nWhen, in April, 1906, I paid the master a visit, he gave me the last of\r\nthese popular campaign writings. Its title was in the form of a\r\nquestion:\r\n\r\n  “En Guérit-on?” (“Is it Curable?”).\r\n\r\nAnd the answer given on p. 4 runs: “=Yes, it is curable, for of all\r\ndiseases syphilis is the one which can best, most easily, and most\r\ncertainly be cured.=” And why? Because we have a wonderful specific\r\nagainst this disease, which, when given =at the proper time= and =in the\r\nproper manner=, works a miracle. This remedy is\r\n\r\n  =Mercury=.\r\n\r\nI put this name clearly and visibly before the eyes of the reader, a\r\nname which for every physician to whose lot it falls to treat cases of\r\nsyphilis has a truly miraculous sound, a name against which =the\r\nunconscientious ignoramuses, the evil-disposed enemies= of the human\r\nrace have spoken their anathema, one which a great thinker and\r\nhonourable man like Schopenhauer regarded as a “triumph of medicine,” a\r\nfact which he experienced personally in his own body. All honourable,\r\ncritical, and scientific physicians agree in this opinion. In my work on\r\n“The Origin of Syphilis,” vol. i., p. 127, I have expressed the matter\r\nin the following words:\r\n\r\n  “Mercury is and remains--notwithstanding the ignorant and\r\n  ill-considered hostility of quacks and their kindred--the =divine\r\n  means= for the treatment of syphilis; mercury is to syphilis what\r\n  =water is to fire=, in the hands =of that physician who knows how to\r\n  use the drug rightly=, how to apply it =at the right time= and =in the\r\n  right form=, who watches closely the =course= of the disease in his\r\n  patient, and who supports the mercury cure (always of =primary\r\n  importance=) by other therapeutic measures as indicated.”\r\n\r\nOnly the =physician=, the scientifically trained medical man, can cure\r\nsyphilis; the quack certainly cannot; in his hands mercury is truly\r\nenough a dangerous “poison.” But he has no right to say, and he speaks\r\ndeliberate untruths when he says, that we physicians “poison” the\r\n“unfortunate” syphilitics with mercury. To such preposterous accusations\r\nwe can give a brief and incisive answer.\r\n\r\nTherefore, during my lecturing journey, undertaken recently[348] under\r\nthe auspices of the German Society for the Suppression of Venereal\r\nDiseases, I prepared the following brief account of the therapeutic\r\nemployment of mercury in syphilis, which in my opinion suffices to throw\r\nthe proper light upon the value and importance of the mercurial\r\ntreatment of the disease; it is a sufficient answer to the\r\n“Nature-Healers,” who are opposed to the use of this “poison”:\r\n\r\n1. =In innumerable instances it has been observed by the most\r\nexperienced and scientific physicians, that cases of syphilis treated\r\nwithout mercury run a very severe course, accompanied by the most\r\ndangerous symptoms, such as extensive destructive lesions of the skin,\r\nlesions of the internal organs, brain syphilis, eating away of the\r\nbones, loss of the nose, etc.=\r\n\r\n2. =In cases which previously have been treated without mercury, the\r\nadministration of the latter drug immediately arrests the destructive\r\nprocesses, and saves the patient from death, or from very severe\r\nillness, and from physical disfigurement.=\r\n\r\n3. =No less an authority than Virchow, in his celebrated treatise “On\r\nthe Nature of Constitutional Syphilitic Affections,” pp. 7-14 (Berlin,\r\n1859), has shown that the hypothesis of Hermann[349] is entirely devoid\r\nof foundation in fact.=\r\n\r\n4. =I should feel conscientiously compelled to denounce myself for the\r\ncommission of grievous bodily harm if I ventured to-day, after the\r\naccumulated experience of four centuries, to treat a case of syphilis\r\nwithout mercury.=\r\n\r\nWhat use is it to continue to fight against the disbelief and\r\nsuperstition which clings to mercury? Why should we for ever be occupied\r\nin contradicting the false accusations brought against this drug? For\r\nfour centuries the divine mercury has withstood all attacks, and will\r\ncontinue to withstand them, until a greatly desired and even better\r\nmeasure is discovered--=prophylactic immunization against syphilitic\r\ninfection=.[350]\r\n\r\nHow mercury is to be given, whether in the form of the long-prized\r\n“=schmierkur=” (=cure by inunction=), or by =hypodermic injection=, or\r\nby =ordinary internal use=, must be left in individual cases to the\r\ndecision of the medical man, for numerous considerations, which can only\r\nbe properly weighed by the physician, have to be taken into account. A\r\nmercury cure is a =serious= matter, but always also one which repays all\r\nthe trouble that we take. In “En Guérit-on?” Fournier has most admirably\r\ndescribed the wonderful results of a =critically considered and\r\ncarefully conducted= mercury cure. I do not, indeed, belong to the\r\n“doctors who build for themselves a house of pure quicksilver,” when\r\nthey enter the field against the “French” (= syphilis), as the phrase\r\nruns in Schiller’s work “The Robbers.” I hold by a =reasonable,\r\nmeasured= use of mercury in the course of the treatment of syphilis, and\r\nI advise a good “=after-treatment=” in addition to the treatment with\r\nmercury.[351] Mercury, when given in moderate but sufficient doses, not\r\nonly destroys the syphilitic virus, but also has a very favourable\r\ninfluence on the general condition, and sometimes even gives rise to an\r\nincrease in the number of the red blood-corpuscles. Thus, mercury is not\r\nonly not a poison: it is a most valuable =restorative and vitalizing\r\nmeans=. This is well illustrated by the following case, which came under\r\nmy own observation, and which I recommend to the Nature-Healers, in the\r\nhope that it may lead them to revise their views regarding the action of\r\nmercury:\r\n\r\n  The case was that of an official, thirty years of age, who had been\r\n  under my care several times before since the year 1898 for other\r\n  troubles (gonorrhœa, etc.), and who was always pale and with hollow\r\n  cheeks, in no way giving the impression of possessing a constitution\r\n  with strong powers of resistance. Late in the summer he was infected\r\n  with syphilis; the attack proved a severe one, running a serious\r\n  course, complicated by an extremely painful suppurative inflammation\r\n  of the lymphatic vessels of the penis, and accompanied by fever,\r\n  lassitude, and a sense of exhaustion. An energetic inunction cure was\r\n  immediately begun. Under this not only did the morbid symptoms rapidly\r\n  disappear, but there occurred a remarkable change in the general\r\n  condition, in the sense of an increase of strength, such as had not\r\n  existed before the illness. Notwithstanding slight stomatitis, the\r\n  patient during and after the cure =felt stronger and more fit for work\r\n  than he ever had before=, and even now this favourable state continues\r\n  unaltered, as is manifested above all by the increase in the\r\n  body-weight, by the good appearance, etc. =The patient=, who now, one\r\n  and a half years after the cure, has had no relapse, =informed me\r\n  repeatedly and spontaneously that this delightful improvement in his\r\n  health could only be attributed to his syphilis (!) or to the\r\n  mercury!=\r\n\r\nA =single= mercury cure will suffice, in some cases, to cure syphilis\r\nfor ever! Regarding this, we have numerous trustworthy observations. In\r\nmost cases, indeed, during the early years relapses occur, and then we\r\nneed to use the indispensable mercury cure once more =with care=, and to\r\nemploy all the other measures which make up the above-mentioned\r\n“after-treatment,” the supplementary means being, above all, =iodide of\r\npotassium, sulphur= (in the long-celebrated sulphur-baths of Aix,\r\nNenndorf, etc.) and =arsenic= (first recommended by me); also the water\r\ncure, brine-baths, and iodide-baths, and a visit to the seaside or to\r\nthe mountains, and massage, are good accessory means to the cure. Above\r\nall, however, =the State of nutrition= of the patient[352] must always\r\nbe kept under consideration, and assisted where necessary, for which\r\npurpose preparations of iron, nutritive preparations like sanatogen, and\r\nmilk cures, are of value. =Strict abstinence= from alcohol is always\r\nnecessary in the treatment of syphilis. Alcohol has a =very\r\nunfavourable= influence on the syphilitic process, and is often the only\r\ncause of continually recurring relapses of this disease.\r\n\r\nThe =thorough= treatment of syphilis is a matter of several years,\r\nduring which the patient must repeatedly present himself to the\r\nphysician for examination, and should any relapse occur, he must be\r\nsubjected to renewed treatment. Such thoroughness will invariably be\r\nrewarded. =Attention to detail= will always bear fruit. Syphilis is\r\n=curable=. It is purely fanciful to say that syphilis is never cured,\r\nthat it pursues its victims up to the end of life, that it knows no\r\npardon. That is not true. =Treat= your syphilitic patients, treat them\r\nproperly and thoroughly, if necessary for years in succession, and they\r\nwill be freed from the disease. “Syphilis,” says Fournier, “is a\r\nmisfortune, but it is a misfortune from which complete recovery is\r\npossible.” From the day when the patient becomes aware that he is\r\nsuffering from syphilis, he must face the situation “in a calm and manly\r\nfashion,” and must say to himself:\r\n\r\n  “Now there is to be a fight between syphilis and me. To work,\r\n  therefore, and courage! Courage, because science assures me that with\r\n  the aid of =mercury=, of =hygiene=, and of =time=, an end will come to\r\n  the syphilis, and because science gives me an absolute assurance that\r\n  some day I shall be as healthy as I was before, and that I shall again\r\n  have the right to a family, that I shall attain the freedom and the\r\n  happiness of being a father!”[353]\r\n\r\nWith these admirable words of the greatest living authority on syphilis,\r\nI close my account of the suppression of syphilis by medical treatment,\r\nand turn to the not less important question of the =management of\r\ngonorrhœa=.\r\n\r\nRecent scientific researches, especially those of A. Neisser and E.\r\nFinger, have shown that the infective urethritis of the male produced\r\nby gonococci is by no means the “trifling and childish complaint” which\r\nit was formerly supposed to be, but, on the contrary, is a very serious\r\nand obstinate trouble, often resisting the very best means of treatment,\r\nso that it may =persist for years=, and =remain for years infective=.\r\nStill worse is it as regards gonorrhœa of the female genital organs, the\r\ncure of which is even more difficult, and the consequences of which are\r\neven more disastrous than in the case of the male. If the =physician= is\r\nneeded for the cure of syphilis, still more is this the case as regards\r\ngonorrhœa. He only can command the scientific methods, and the very\r\ncomplicated technique of the treatment of gonorrhœa. He only can\r\nundertake the =indispensable= control of the treatment by means of\r\n=microscopic= and other methods of investigation. Every cobbler thinks\r\nhe can cure gonorrhœa, and yet it is this disease which, even more than\r\nsyphilis, demands the most precise knowledge of the local anatomical and\r\npathological conditions. Blaschko rightly says:\r\n\r\n  “While no one gives a damaged watch to a baker to mend, or a torn coat\r\n  to a tinsmith, every one seems to believe that in order to restore the\r\n  most valuable gift of humanity, health, it is unnecessary to possess\r\n  the profoundest knowledge of the human body, and to understand the\r\n  nature and the causes of the disease. Anyone who has come to grief in\r\n  his ordinary profession, but who understands how with a brazen voice\r\n  to denounce the so-called ‘medicine of the schools,’ and to praise\r\n  with sufficient confidence his own successes, is supposed to possess\r\n  the wonderful power, without any exact knowledge at all, of charming\r\n  all the illnesses of mankind out of the world.”\r\n\r\nGonorrhœa is also a =curable= disease, though curable often with great\r\ndifficulty. We see this from the fact that, notwithstanding the\r\nextraordinarily wide diffusion of gonorrhœa (for a far greater number of\r\ninfections with gonorrhœa occur than of infections with syphilis), still\r\nultimately the =majority= of the men, and a large proportion of the\r\nwomen, infected with gonorrhœa are =completely cured= of their trouble.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of gonorrhœa is a complicated affair. =Within the first\r\ntwo days=, by the injection of =powerful caustic agents=, we are\r\nsometimes able to cut the matter short and to put an end completely to\r\nthe gonococci. In every case the patient, as soon as he perceives a\r\ndischarge, though not yet purulent, from the urethra, should\r\n=immediately= consult a physician, in order to determine the nature of\r\nhis disease, which, in the majority of cases, will be found to be true\r\ngonorrhœa. If it is not possible to abort the gonorrhœa, then the\r\ndisease will have to run its course. The best measure, whenever\r\npossible, is =rest in bed= for a week or two, in association with a\r\n=mild, unstimulating diet=, and the =absolute prohibition of all\r\nalcoholic beverages=--the last is indispensable throughout the duration\r\nof the gonorrhœa--the drinking of uva ursi tea, and, if the inflammatory\r\nsymptoms are severe, the application of cold compresses to the penis.\r\nOnly when the first more severe symptoms have passed away, by which\r\ntime, owing to the reaction of the urethral mucous membrane, a large\r\nproportion of the exciters of the disease will already have been\r\nexpelled, is it time to begin =injections= or =irrigations= of the\r\n=urethra=, containing medicaments the nature of which must be left to\r\nthe decision of the experienced =physician=, who will regard each\r\nindividual case on its own merits. If rest in bed is not possible, the\r\npatient must wear a so-called “=suspensory=” bandage, in order to give\r\nas much rest as possible to the testicles and the epididymis, which are\r\ngravely endangered in every attack of gonorrhœa. If, as often happens,\r\ngonorrhœa ascends to the posterior part of the urethra, or to the\r\nbladder, or to the prostate, or if, finally, it becomes chronic, then\r\nspecial methods of treatment, with =internal medicines, with local\r\ncauterization, massage, distension, medicated bougies, baths=, etc., are\r\nneedful. The cure will ensue very gradually; relapses are frequent; even\r\ncessation of the discharge is no certain sign of cure, as the presence\r\nin the still turbid urine of “threads” containing gonococci sufficiently\r\nproves. Only when the urine has become perfectly clear, and any threads\r\nwhich it may contain are shown by repeated search to contain no more\r\ngonococci; when also the prostate, a favourite seat of the last remnants\r\nof gonorrhœa, is free from inflammation, can the cure be regarded as\r\ncomplete. Even more difficult is the determination of a cure in women.\r\nBut persistency in the treatment, and frequently repeated examinations,\r\nwill lead also in women to the desired goal, or, at any rate, will\r\novercome the capacity for spreading the infection.\r\n\r\nIn the campaign against venereal diseases by the methods of medical\r\ntreatment, the =facilitation= of treatment for the =great masses of\r\nimpecunious= persons, for the proletariat, is of great value. For them,\r\nabove all, the provision of _Krankenkassen_[354] is needed, and it is\r\nvery satisfactory to note that during recent years the Krankenkassen\r\nhave especially directed their attention to venereal diseases, since A.\r\nBlaschko,[355] A. Neisser,[356] R. Ledermann,[357] and Albert Kohn[358]\r\ndrew attention to the duties of Krankenkassen in this relationship in a\r\nnumber of admirable works. Krankenkassen are in a position to obtain\r\nexact statistics regarding venereal diseases; to diffuse information,\r\nverbally and in writing, to the widest extent among their members; to\r\nfacilitate hospital treatment, and treatment by specialists; to give\r\nmedical aid as required to infected relatives of the insured; to carry\r\nout regularly every year, once or twice, a medical examination of all\r\nmembers, and to distribute among all these writings on the prophylaxis\r\nof venereal diseases. The question also of payment on the part of the\r\npatient requires new regulations as regards venereal diseases.[359]\r\n\r\nFinally, it has been recommended that, in association with the\r\nKrankenkassen there should be founded “=daily sanatoria=” (Neisser),\r\n“=work sanatoria=” (Saalfeld), “=ambulatory places for treatment=”\r\n(Ledermann), and “=convalescent homes=” (Stern), for members of\r\nKrankenkassen suffering from venereal disease, and for insured persons\r\nsimilarly affected. All these institutions would, moreover, be valuable\r\nto the community at large.\r\n\r\nWhat admirable results are obtainable by such a =systematic= treatment\r\nof as far as possible =all= the venereal patients throughout an entire\r\ncountry has been shown by the astonishing decline in the number of cases\r\nof venereal diseases in Sweden and Norway, and in Bosnia, where a\r\ngratuitous treatment of all such patients at the cost of the state has\r\nbeen introduced. Thus the =organized campaign= against venereal\r\ndiseases, which during recent years has been initiated in all the\r\ncivilized countries of Europe, has led more particularly to efforts in\r\nthe direction of the sufficient treatment and speedy cure of =recent=\r\nsyphilis and =recent= gonorrhœa.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe pass now to the consideration of the =third= factor in the campaign\r\nagainst venereal disease, which comprises the duty of the =state=, the\r\ntask of =social hygiene=, and the task of =public pedagogy=.\r\n\r\nThe =foundation= for the suppression of venereal diseases by state\r\neffort consists in a knowledge of the =extent of the diffusion= of these\r\ndiseases; we need, that is to say, =accurate statistics regarding\r\nvenereal diseases=.\r\n\r\nIt is once more the great service of Blaschko to have been the first in\r\nGermany to work on these lines.[360]\r\n\r\nDismissing from consideration the distribution of venereal diseases in\r\ncountries outside of Europe, regarding which he gives interesting\r\nreports, we find that the European conditions are of such a nature that\r\nthe large towns, the centres of industry and manufacture, garrison\r\ntowns, and university towns, are most severely affected; that the\r\nsmaller provincial towns suffer less; that the agricultural population\r\nis comparatively free from this disease, with the exception of the\r\nuncultivated country districts of Russia and of the Balkan States, where\r\nthe country people suffer from syphilis to a terrible extent. No exact\r\nstatistical data are at present available regarding the diffusion of\r\nvenereal diseases in the individual countries of Europe. The best\r\nmeasure of the prevalence of these diseases is afforded by the figures\r\nfor the different armies. From these we learn that Denmark, Germany,\r\nGerman Austria, and Switzerland, show the most favourable conditions;\r\nnext come Belgium, France, Spain, Portugal, North and Middle Italy.\r\nWorst of all are the conditions in Southern Italy, Greece, Turkey,\r\nRussia, and--England. These army statistics are, however, insufficient,\r\nfor, as a matter of fact, =England= is most favourably placed in respect\r\nof the diffusion of venereal diseases. The most exact reports come from\r\nthe Scandinavian countries, from Norway and Denmark, in which for\r\nseveral years =all physicians= have kept a list of all the infective\r\ndiseases treated by them, as they are compelled =every week= to make a\r\nreturn to the Board of Public Health. According to these reports, it\r\nappears that venereal diseases in Copenhagen constitute the greater part\r\nof such diseases in the entire country; but in the period between 1876\r\nand 1895 these diseases have notably =declined= in frequency in\r\nCopenhagen, and all venereal diseases have shared in this decline;\r\ngonorrhœa constitutes 70 % =of all= cases of venereal disease. With\r\nregard to the diffusion of infection, it appears from the Copenhagen\r\nstatistics that =one= woman with venereal disease serves to transmit it\r\nto =four= men; on the other hand, of =four= men with venereal disease,\r\n=one= only will transmit that disease to a woman. On the average, there\r\nare infected with venereal disease every year 16 to 20 % of all young\r\nmen between the ages of twenty and thirty years; with gonorrhœa 1 in 8\r\nare infected; with syphilis 1 in 55 are infected. In these last ten\r\nyears, for every 100 young men living, there have been 119 infections\r\nduring ten years; that is to say, =on the average every one has been\r\ninfected once, and a great many have been infected more than once=; in\r\nthe same period of ten years, for every 100 young men, there have been\r\n18 infected with syphilis--that is to say, 1 for every 5·5.\r\n\r\nEspecially valuable also are the figures which Blaschko obtained in 1898\r\nfrom the carefully kept books of a large mercantile Krankenkasse whose\r\noperations were diffused throughout Germany; these figures also give the\r\nresult of an inquiry regarding venereal diseases amongst workmen,\r\nwaiting-maids, secret prostitutes, and students. The result of these\r\nstatistics, as regards Berlin, are given briefly in the following table:\r\n\r\n  +---------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                                         |\r\n  |============================== Secret Prostitutes, 30 %. |\r\n  |                                                         |\r\n  |========================= Students, 25 %.                |\r\n  |                                                         |\r\n  |================ Shop Employees, 16 %.                   |\r\n  |                                                         |\r\n  |========= Workmen, 9 %.                                  |\r\n  |                                                         |\r\n  |==== Soldiers, 4 %.                                      |\r\n  |                                                         |\r\n  +---------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nVENEREAL DISEASES AFFECTING VARIOUS CLASSES OF THE POPULATION OF BERLIN\r\n(AFTER BLASCHKO).\r\n\r\nAccording to these statistics, the diffusion of venereal diseases among\r\n=shop employees=, =students=, and =secret prostitutes= (chiefly\r\n=barmaids= and =waitresses=), is the greatest; it is much =less= among\r\n=workmen= and =soldiers=. It further appears, from Blaschko’s inquiry,\r\nthat =of the men who entered on marriage for the first time when above\r\nthe age of thirty years, each one had, on the average, had gonorrhœa\r\ntwice=, and =about one in four or five had been infected with syphilis=.\r\nWilhelm Erb, in Heidelberg, obtained similar results.\r\n\r\nStill more remarkable were the results of the statistical investigation\r\nwhich was carried out for the =entire Kingdom of Prussia= by the\r\nPrussian Ministry of Ecclesiastical Affairs and Public Instruction on\r\nApril 30, 1900.[361]\r\n\r\nAccording to this investigation, it appeared that on this day, in\r\nPrussia, there were 41,000 persons suffering from venereal disease,\r\namong whom 11,000 were infected with recent syphilis; in Berlin, on the\r\nsame day, there were 11,600 cases of venereal disease, among whom 3,000\r\nwere infected with recent syphilis. The general relations are shown in\r\nthe following table:\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                                |\r\n  |=== The whole of Prussia, 0·28 %.               |\r\n  |                                                |\r\n  |============== Berlin, 1·42 %.                  |\r\n  |                                                |\r\n  |========== Towns over 100,000 inhabitants, 1 %. |\r\n  |                                                |\r\n  |====== Towns over 30,000 inhabitants, 0·58 %.   |\r\n  |                                                |\r\n  |===== Towns below 30,000 inhabitants, 0·45 %.   |\r\n  |                                                |\r\n  |== The Army, 0·15 %.                            |\r\n  |                                                |\r\n  +------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nVENEREAL DISEASES AFFECTING THE MALE POPULATION OF PRUSSIA, APRIL 30,\r\n1900 (AFTER BLASCHKO).\r\n\r\nThus, for every 10,000 adult men there were on this day persons\r\nsuffering from venereal diseases to the following numbers: in Berlin,\r\n142; in the remaining large towns, 100; in the smaller towns, 50; and in\r\nthe whole of Prussia, on the average, 28. Naturally the figures should\r\nin reality be larger, for of the physicians to whom inquiries were sent,\r\nonly 63 % returned an answer. Moreover, the =annual= figure of cases is\r\na very much larger one. Kirchner[362] assumes that =every day= in\r\nPrussia more than =100,000 individuals=--that is to say, about 3 per\r\nmille--are suffering from a transmissible venereal disease, and he\r\nestimates the damage to the national property by typhoid fever as about\r\n8 million marks annually, but that from venereal diseases as not less\r\nthan =ninety million marks annually=. In these reports of April 30,\r\n1900, the ratio of men to women suffering from recent syphilis was as\r\n3 : 1.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain more exact information regarding the diffusion of\r\nvenereal diseases, and the actual number of those affected by them, it\r\nis of very great importance that there should be a =revision= of the\r\nduty of medical men in respect of the =notification of diseases=, and\r\nalso in respect of the duty of =professional secrecy=.[363]\r\n\r\nThis latter question is also of importance in respect of the prevention\r\nof venereal infection in married life. (The question of syphilitic\r\ninfection of married women by their husbands has recently been\r\nconsidered by Alfred Fournier: “Syphilis in Honourable Women.”)\r\n\r\nIn addition to the question of the diffusion and frequency of venereal\r\ndiseases, the greatest interest attaches to the =sources of dangerous\r\ninfections=--that is to say, the question where men and women most\r\nfrequently contract venereal disease.\r\n\r\nHere also Blaschko has obtained interesting information; he states:\r\n\r\nOf 487 syphilitic men, the disease was acquired by 395 (81·1 %) from\r\nprofessional prostitutes (officially inscribed or secret); 23 (4·7 %)\r\nfrom waitresses and barmaids; 23 (4·9 %) from their “intimate”; 45\r\n(9·2 %) from casual acquaintances, shop-girls, or workwomen.\r\n\r\nAccording to this report, it appears that =prostitution=, public and\r\nsecret (under which heading the waitresses and “casual acquaintances”\r\nmust be numbered), forms the =principal focus= of venereal infection.\r\n\r\nAnd that wild sexual intercourse is here almost exclusively to blame is\r\nshown by the following statistics, given by Blaschko:\r\n\r\nOf 67 syphilitic wives, almost all the wives of workmen, 64 were\r\ninfected by their =husbands=; whereas, =on the contrary=, of 106\r\nhusbands, 7 only acquired the disease from their wives; the remaining 99\r\nacquired it by =extra-conjugal sexual intercourse=, either before or\r\nafter marriage.\r\n\r\nAnother very valuable set of statistics dealing with the sources of\r\ninfection has been published by Heinrich Loeb.[364]\r\n\r\nThese relate to the conditions in Mannheim. It appears that the sources\r\nof infection were as follows:\r\n\r\n  Waitresses and barmaids                     155 instances.\r\n  Maidservants, cooks                          67     „\r\n  Shop-girls                                   65     „\r\n  Middle-class girls                           29     „\r\n  Seamstresses and embroidery workers          27     „\r\n  Chambermaids                                 20     „\r\n  Factory workwomen                            17     „\r\n  Artistes, singers, and ballet-girls          16     „\r\n  Wife or betrothed                            12     „\r\n  Tailoresses and modistes                     11     „\r\n  Ironers                                       9     „\r\n  Book-keepers                                  4     „\r\n  Widows                                        4     „\r\n  Country girls                                 3     „\r\n  Mistresses                                    3     „\r\n                                              ---\r\n                                        Total 442\r\n\r\nHere, as we see, the chief types of =secret= prostitution, the\r\n=waitresses= and =barmaids=, play the principal part; next, but a long\r\nway after, come maidservants and shop-girls. This, however, does not\r\namount to saying that public prostitution is less dangerous. We know\r\nthat a prostitute who has never been infected with venereal disease is\r\nsomething very rarely seen; that prostitutes under regulation are almost\r\nall, especially when still quite young, in an infective state, and that\r\nthey serve just as much as secret prostitutes for the diffusion of\r\nvenereal disease. It is a well-known fact that youthful prostitutes are\r\n=more dangerous= than women who have long practised prostitution,\r\nbecause the former are all suffering from more or less recent infection,\r\nand both gonorrhœa and syphilis are present in them in the stages in\r\nwhich they are still strongly infective. H. Berger bases upon\r\nstatistical investigations[365] his belief that red-haired girls have\r\nthe most delicate epithelium, fall sick most rapidly and in the greatest\r\nnumbers; dark haired women at first suffer less. After they have been\r\nprostitutes for some time, there is no important difference between\r\nblonde, brown, and black-haired women; but black-haired prostitutes are,\r\nin fact, more inclined to infection =later= in their career, because\r\nthey are more in request.\r\n\r\nNow that we have learned that at the present day =prostitution= remains\r\nthe principal source of venereal infection, the following question\r\nimmediately demands an answer: =What can the state do in order to remove\r\nthese sources of infection? and have the measures which the state has\r\nhitherto put into operation been of any use in this direction?= To put\r\nit shortly, what part has been played by the state =regulation= of\r\nprostitution, as hitherto practised, in the campaign against venereal\r\ndiseases?\r\n\r\nWith Schmölder,[366] we understand by “regulation” the following\r\npractice, which is what obtains in the majority of civilized countries:\r\nThe police keep a list in which the girls and women regarded by them as\r\nprostitutes have their names entered. The “inscribed” (_inscrites_)\r\nreceive a “_licentia stupri_”--that is to say, =the permission to\r\npractise professional fornication under continual observation on\r\nthe part of the police= (the renowned “moral control”[367]), which\r\nis associated with a number of commands, prohibitions, and\r\nregulations--above all, with the =necessity of submitting to medical\r\nexamination at definitely stated intervals=, and, where necessary, to\r\n=compulsory medical treatment=. At the same time, public prostitution on\r\nthe part of those who are not inscribed is suppressed as much as\r\npossible. Berger has admirably described (“Prostitution in Hanover,” pp.\r\n1-19) the methods of regulation and their consequences. Above all,\r\nhowever, have Blaschko, Schmölder, and Neisser considered the modes of\r\nregulation customary at the present day from the moral, legal, and\r\nmedical points of view, and have in part entirely condemned them\r\n(Blaschko and Schmölder), in part declared them to be gravely in need of\r\nreform (Neisser).[368]\r\n\r\nAmong those who have recently discussed the question of the regulation\r\nof prostitution, we may mention Anna Pappritz,[369] who condemns the\r\npractice; Clausmann, who is in favour of it;[370] Friedrich Hammer, also\r\nin favour of it;[371] and, finally, S. Bettmann, who leaves the question\r\nopen.[372]\r\n\r\nIn our consideration of the coercive system of regulation, we take a\r\n=single standpoint=--namely, that of its possible value for the\r\nsuppression of venereal diseases. Some demand the =abolition= of\r\nregulation on ethical and humanitarian grounds, and we do not wish in\r\nany way to make light of these grounds. But they could not be decisive,\r\nif, as an actual fact, regulation had an effect either in diminishing\r\nthe prevalence of venereal diseases or in checking prostitution; but, in\r\ntruth, the =reverse= is the case!\r\n\r\nSchmölder[373] has shown beyond dispute that the compulsory inscription\r\nof prostitutes, introduced from France, is in our country an utterly\r\n=illegal= measure, arbitrarily enforced by the police. It has been amply\r\nproved that this illegal compulsory inscription has actually made\r\nprostitutes of many girls who had no inclination to permanent\r\nprofessional prostitution; that this method =produces artificial\r\nprostitutes=. What errors of judgment, what abuses of power, occur on\r\nthe part of the police, in connexion with this compulsory inscription!\r\nHow often does the inscription result from a denunciation made on\r\ngrounds of private spite! The “Committee of Fifteen,” constituted for\r\nthe study of prostitution in New York, declares in its report:\r\n\r\n  “Men with political insight are of opinion that every limitation of\r\n  the freedom of the individual is in itself an evil, and that such a\r\n  limitation can only be justified in cases in which the good derived\r\n  from the infringement can really be estimated at a very high\r\n  valuation. A system which permits the police, simply on grounds of\r\n  suspicion, to arrest a citizen, to submit him to an injurious\r\n  examination, only with the aim of discovering a disease he is\r\n  suspected to have, and then to put him into prison, on the suspicion\r\n  that he might have indulged in immoral intercourse if he had been left\r\n  at liberty, cannot possibly be regarded as harmonizing with the\r\n  principles of personal freedom.”[374]\r\n\r\nBlaschko and Fiaux have proved that regulation concerns only a =small\r\nfraction= of prostitutes, usually the older ones; whereas the\r\n=beginners=, who are precisely those most dangerous in respect of\r\nvenereal infection, and, further, the army of =secret prostitutes=,\r\n=half prostitutes=, =occasional prostitutes=, and the =half-world=,\r\nremain free from regulation--are probably left free deliberately--and\r\nanyhow could not possibly be supervised, on account of the enormous cost\r\nof supervision. In Berlin, speaking generally, only =one-fifth= part of\r\nthe girls arrested are subjected to regulation, four-fifths are simply\r\n“warned and discharged”; and even of this fifth part, in reality a large\r\npercentage does not come under control because “escape from the lists”\r\nrenders permanent observation impossible. Fiaux proves that =more than\r\n50 %= of the medical examinations which ought to have been made on the\r\n4,000 women under regulation in Berlin during the years 1888 to 1901,\r\n=were in fact neglected=.[375]\r\n\r\nIt is =certain= that regulated prostitution is =more dangerous= from the\r\npoint of view of public health than free prostitution. The prostitute\r\nremaining under surveillance is in constant fear of compulsory treatment\r\nin the lock hospital, and therefore endeavours to conceal her illness\r\n=as long as possible, or temporarily to avoid medical examination\r\naltogether=. The free prostitute has a personal interest in becoming\r\nwell again as soon as possible, and generally goes voluntarily and at\r\nonce to seek treatment from a physician. Thus it happens that, among the\r\nregulated prostitutes, the number of those infected =appears=\r\nsurprisingly small. In addition, we have to consider the =inadequacy of\r\nthe medical examination=, because the number of the physicians and the\r\ntime assigned to them are too small. And whilst it appears to be a fact\r\nthat every third prostitute is infected with gonorrhœa, in Berlin,\r\nduring the year 1889, as the result of official examination under\r\nregulation, only one prostitute in 200 was declared infected, and in\r\n1884 only 1 in 1,873. Moreover, =very many= infected prostitutes under\r\ncompulsory medical treatment are, as Blaschko proves, allowed to resume\r\ntheir professional occupation in an uncured state, and to diffuse their\r\nillness freely once more. The figures given by Blaschko speak very\r\nclearly on this point:\r\n\r\n  +---------------+-------------+-------------------------+\r\n  |               |             |  _Annual Percentage of  |\r\n  |               |             |  Prostitutes attacked   |\r\n  |   _Place._    |   _Date._   |      by Syphilis._      |\r\n  |               |             +------------+------------+\r\n  |               |             | Regulated. |   Free.    |\r\n  +---------------+-------------+------------+------------+\r\n  |Paris          |  1878-1887  |    12·2    |     7·0    |\r\n  |Brussels       |  1887-1889  |    25·0    |     9·0    |\r\n  |St. Petersburg |    1890     |    33·5    |    12·0    |\r\n  |Antwerp        |  1882-1884  |    51·3    |     7·7    |\r\n  +---------------+-------------+------------+------------+\r\n\r\nFrom this it is clear that the =abolition= of the regulation of\r\nprostitutes will not have an unfavourable, but, on the contrary, will\r\nhave a thoroughly =favourable=, influence in respect of the frequency of\r\nvenereal diseases. The conditions in England and Norway show this very\r\nclearly. In Christiania, after the abolition of regulation in the year\r\n1888, syphilis declined in frequency--in the first place, because the\r\nnumber of girls who applied for treatment increased, whilst prior to the\r\nabolition of regulation they had concealed their illness in order to\r\navoid falling into the hands of the police; and in the second place,\r\nbecause now the fear of venereal infection kept many young men from\r\nhaving intercourse with prostitutes, whereas previously they had\r\nerroneously believed that the “control” would free them from the danger\r\nof venereal infection. The same was the case in London, where there is\r\nno regulation; the frequency of venereal disease has decreased because\r\nyoung men now avoid intercourse with prostitutes as much as possible. In\r\nFrance, the country in which regulation was first introduced, the\r\ncommission formed for the study of prostitution came to the conclusion\r\nthat “=regulation of prostitutes should be abolished=.” The principal\r\nreason for which the police continue to advocate the preservation of the\r\nsystem of regulation--namely, that they have an interest in the matter\r\non account of the =intimate connexion between many prostitutes and\r\ncriminality=--will not bear examination. It is true enough that\r\n=soutenage=[376] is inseparable from prostitution. Moreover, =the world\r\nof criminals= is very near to prostitution, in the first place, because\r\nthe prostitute also has need of a man on whom she can lean, who can be\r\nsomething to her from the =personal= point of view, to whom she is not\r\nsimply a chattel;[377] and, in the second place, because the prostitute\r\nis, like the criminal, =despised and defamed=--she shares with the\r\ncriminal the pariah nature. Lombroso’s doctrine that prostitution is\r\nthroughout equivalent to criminality is certainly not justified. =It is\r\nonly by the outward circumstances of their life that the bulk of\r\nprostitutes are driven into intimate relations with criminality.= And\r\namong these outward circumstances, =regulation=, and the =expulsion= of\r\nprostitutes from honourable society (which is a necessary part of\r\nregulation) play the principal rôle! For this reason, if for this reason\r\nalone, regulation must be abolished, because then a strong supplement to\r\ncriminality from the circles of prostitution would be cut off.\r\n\r\nEven before investigators had become convinced of the uselessness and\r\ndanger of regulation the cry arose: “=Away with the brothels!=” We have\r\nalready alluded to the continuous =decline= in the number of brothels in\r\nall large towns. In 1841 there were in Paris still 235 brothels (to\r\n1,200,000 inhabitants); in 1900 there were only 48 brothels (to\r\n3,600,000 inhabitants); and for St. Petersburg and other large towns a\r\nsimilar decline in the number of brothels can be established,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that everywhere the population has markedly\r\nincreased. This proves that the brothels no longer correspond to any\r\nreal need.[378] At the present day, owing to the great development of\r\nintercourse in modern times, brothels are a public calamity; they bring\r\nthe quarter of the town in which they exist into disrepute, and deprive\r\nthe neighbourhood of its proper monetary value. Moreover, the time is\r\npast for slave-holding on the part of the brothel-owner. The existence\r\nof brothels favours the traffic in girls (the “White Slave Trade”),\r\nencourages sexual perversities, and increases the diffusion of venereal\r\ndiseases. The prostitute living in a brothel is sometimes compelled to\r\nhave intercourse with ten or twelve men in a single day, and is thus\r\npre-eminently exposed to venereal infection, all the more because she\r\nmust admit the embraces of =every= man who pays the brothel-keeper\r\nmoney; whilst the prostitute living freely can at least refuse to have\r\nanything to do with a man who appears to her to be ill. According to\r\nLecour, Mireur, Diday, and Sperk, prostitutes in brothels suffer from\r\nsyphilis about =three times as often= as free prostitutes.[379]\r\n\r\nOther modifications of brothel life, such as the so-called “=controlled\r\nstreets=,”[380] the best known of which are in Bremen[381]--that is to\r\nsay, streets closed to ordinary traffic, the houses of which are\r\ninhabited only by prostitutes under control, but the girls being in\r\nother respects free and not living under the domination of a\r\nbrothel-keeper; also the “=Kasernierung=”[382] of prostitutes, their\r\nconfinement to particular streets, or special “quarters” of the town\r\n(“Dirnenquartiere”)[383]--are all to be rejected on the same grounds.\r\n\r\nThe whole nature of brothel life, and the very serious dangers it\r\ninvolves, have been discussed in excellent works by E. von Düring,[384]\r\nHenriette Fürth,[385] Karl Nötzel,[386] and Martin Bruck.[387] They\r\nillumine the whole question, and provide sufficient grounds for the\r\ncondemnation of brothels.\r\n\r\nA few authors, however, continue to advocate the preservation of\r\nbrothels, and some of these wish to enforce medical examination, not\r\nonly of prostitutes, but also of their masculine clients. This\r\nproposition is made, for example, by Ernst Kromayer in his work, which,\r\nnotwithstanding many Utopian ideas, is nevertheless very stimulating,\r\n“The Eradication of Syphilis,” pp. 67, 68 (Berlin, 1898). Von Düring, in\r\nhis criticism of these ideas, rightly points out that this\r\nrecommendation would be quite useless in practice, because, in the first\r\nplace, only a small proportion of men visit brothels at all. In the\r\nsecond place, in the hurry in these resorts no proper examination could\r\nbe undertaken. In the third place, the doctors who were to be appointed\r\nas a kind of medical porters to brothels, would not easily be found to\r\naccept such situations. Lassar, who answers this last criticism, is of\r\nopinion that the brothel-master, or anybody with a little experience,\r\ncould easily undertake this examination in the case of men.[388]\r\n\r\nBut these men would probably also decline the office; and even if they\r\nwere willing, it is very doubtful if they would be in a position to make\r\nthe suggested examinations, which, after all, require =real medical\r\nskill=; and, finally, the only result would be--to increase the number\r\nof quacks. Therefore, this idea of the examination of the male visitors\r\nto brothels is Utopian.\r\n\r\nNo, the true hope lies in =absolute freedom=; in =relieving prostitution\r\nfrom the oppression of the police=; in its gradual =separation from\r\ncriminality=; in--I am not afraid of the word--in an “=ennoblement=” of\r\nprostitution.[389] The “prostitute” (German _Dirne_ = drab) must\r\ndisappear, and the “human being” must reawaken. The prostituted woman\r\nmust be readmitted into the social community. No more coercion! =Free\r\nand voluntary treatment=, in polyclinics[390] and hospitals; the\r\n“=rescue=” of youthful prostitutes,[391] not in the prison-like\r\n“=Magdalen Homes=,” but by means of ethically instructive influence\r\n=from human being to human being=, of the value of which the “Letters to\r\nProstitutes” of the noble philanthropist Frau Eggers-Smidt,[392] and\r\nalso the experiences of the Salvation Army,[393] give such admirable\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nVery aptly, also, Kromayer has shown to what an extent a change in our\r\npresent attitude towards sexual intercourse outside the conditions of\r\ncoercive marriage, the removal of the stamp of infamy from such\r\nintercourse, would limit prostitution, and therewith also limit venereal\r\ndiseases.[394] This is as clear as daylight. But, unfortunately, those\r\nvery persons who declare the existing conditions in respect of\r\nprostitution to be absolutely intolerable will not admit its truth.\r\n\r\nThe misery of the life of these unhappy creatures must be relieved, but\r\n=we= must do it =ourselves=, and soon; for they are not in a position to\r\ndo so. The last, the highest goal of the campaign against venereal\r\ndisease is the humanization of the prostitute.[395]\r\n\r\n  SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE.--In the essay on “The Woman’s Question” in the\r\n  sociological section of his work, “The Ethic of Free-Thought,” Karl\r\n  Pearson discusses the question of Prostitution in relation to the\r\n  Woman’s Question at large. His remarks have especial interest in view\r\n  of what is said above about “the ennoblement of prostitution” and “the\r\n  humanization of the prostitute,” and it seems expedient to quote the\r\n  passage at length (_op. cit._, 1888, pp. 379-382).--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n  “The emancipation of woman, while placing her in a position of social\r\n  responsibility, will make it her duty to investigate many matters of\r\n  which she is at present frequently assumed to be ignorant. It may be\r\n  doubted whether the identification of purity and ignorance has had\r\n  wholly good effects in the past; indeed, it has frequently been the\r\n  false cry with which men have sought to hide their own anti-social\r\n  conduct. It is certain, however, that it cannot last in the future,\r\n  and man will have to face the fact that woman’s views and social\r\n  action with regard to many sex-problems may widely differ from his\r\n  own. It is of the utmost importance that woman, not only on account of\r\n  the part she already plays in the education of the young, but also\r\n  because of the social responsibilities her emancipation must bring,\r\n  should have a full knowledge of the laws of sex. Every attempt\r\n  hitherto to grapple with prostitution has been a failure. What will\r\n  women do when they thoroughly grasp the problem, and have a voice in\r\n  the attitude the state should assume in regard to it? At present\r\n  hundreds do not know of its existence; thousands only know of it to\r\n  despise those who earn their living by it; one in ten thousand has\r\n  examined the causes which lead to it, has felt that degradation, if\r\n  there be any, lies not in the prostitute, but in the society where it\r\n  exists; not in the women of the streets, but in the thousands of women\r\n  in society, who are ignorant of the problem, ignore it, or fear to\r\n  face it. What will be the result of woman’s action in the matter? Can\r\n  it possibly be effectual, or will it merely tend to embitter the\r\n  relations of men and women? Possibly an expression of woman’s opinion\r\n  on this point in society and the press would do much, but then it must\r\n  be an educated opinion, one which recognizes facts and knows the\r\n  difficulties of the problem. An appeal to chivalry, to a Christian\r\n  dogma, to a Biblical text, will hardly avail. The description we have\r\n  of Calvin’s Geneva shows that puritanic suppression is wholly idle.\r\n  What form will be taken by the reasoned action of women, cognizant of\r\n  historical and sexualogical fact?\r\n\r\n  “Perhaps it may be that women, when they fully grasp the problem, will\r\n  despair, as many men do, of its solution. They may remark that\r\n  prostitution has existed in nearly all historic times, and among\r\n  nearly all races of men. It has existed as an institution as long as\r\n  monogamic marriage has existed; it may be itself the outcome of that\r\n  marriage. I do not know whether any trace of a like promiscuity has\r\n  been found in the animals nearest allied to man--I believe not. The\r\n  periodic instinct has probably preserved them from it. How mankind\r\n  came to lose the periodic instinct, and how that loss may possibly be\r\n  related to the solely human institution of marriage, are problems not\r\n  without interest. On the one hand, it has been asserted that\r\n  prostitution is a logical outcome of our _present_ social relations,\r\n  while, on the other hand, it is held to be a survival of matriarchal\r\n  licence, and not a _sine qua non_ of all forms of human society. There\r\n  is very considerable evidence to show that a large percentage of women\r\n  are driven to prostitution by absolute want, or by the extremities to\r\n  which a seduced woman is forced by the society which casts her out.\r\n  This point is important. It may, perhaps, be that our social system,\r\n  quite as much as man’s supposed needs, keeps prostitution alive. The\r\n  frequency with which prostitutes, for the sake of their own living,\r\n  seduce comparative boys, may be as much a cause of the evil as male\r\n  passion itself. The socialists hold the sale of a woman’s person to be\r\n  directly associated with the monopoly of surplus labour. Is the\r\n  emancipated woman likely to adopt this view? and if so shall we not\r\n  have a wide-reaching social reconstruction forced upon us? That\r\n  emancipated woman would strive for a vast economic reorganization, as\r\n  the only means of preserving the self-respect and independence of her\r\n  sex, is a possibility with the gravest and most wide-reaching\r\n  consequences. We cannot emancipate woman without placing her in a\r\n  position of political and social influence equal to man’s. It may well\r\n  be that she will regard economic and sexual problems from a very\r\n  different standpoint, and the result will infallibly lead to the\r\n  formation of a woman’s party, and to a more or less conscious struggle\r\n  between the sexes. Would this end in an increased social stability or\r\n  another subjection of sex?\r\n\r\n  “Woman may, however, conclude that the alternative is true--that\r\n  prostitution is not the outcome of our present social organisation,\r\n  but a feature of all forms of human society. She must, then, treat it\r\n  as a necessary evil or as a necessary good. In the former case she\r\n  will at least insist on an equal social stigma attaching to both sexes\r\n  if she does not demand, as in the instance of any other form of\r\n  anti-social conduct, so far as practicable its legal repression. In\r\n  the latter case--that is, if its existence really tends in some way to\r\n  the welfare or stability of society--women will have to admit that\r\n  prostitution is an honourable profession; they cannot shirk that\r\n  conclusion, bitter as it may appear to some. The ‘social outcast’\r\n  would then have to be recognized as filling a social function, and the\r\n  problem would reduce to the amelioration of her life, and to her\r\n  elevation in the social scale. Either there is a means of abolishing\r\n  prostitution, or all participators must be treated alike as\r\n  anti-social, or the prostitute is an honourable woman--no other\r\n  possibility suggests itself. Society has hitherto failed to find a\r\n  remedy, perhaps because only man has sought for one; woman, when she\r\n  for the time fully grasps the problem, must be prepared for one, or\r\n  must recognize the alternatives. There cannot be a doubt, however,\r\n  that in a matter so closely concerning her personal dignity she will\r\n  take action, and that, if only in this one matter, her freedom will\r\n  raise questions, which many would prefer to ignore, and which, when\r\n  raised, will undoubtedly touch principles apparently fundamental to\r\n  our existing social organization.”\r\n\r\n  [330] See note to p. 390.\r\n\r\n  [331] Parent-Duchatelet, “The Moral Corruption of the Female Sex in\r\n  Paris,” vol. ii., p. 234 (Leipzig, 1837).

Servants suffering from\r\n  venereal disease, since at the present day they usually preserve\r\n  secrecy as to their trouble, in order that they may not lose their\r\n  place, constitute a dangerous source of infection for their employers\r\n  and the latters’ children.

The Chief Commissioner of the Berlin Police\r\n  addressed to the medical specialists in venereal diseases an inquiry\r\n  whether they were prepared to treat gratuitously impecunious\r\n  prostitutes who were not under police control. The girls would then be\r\n  given a register of these doctors. If they presented themselves for\r\n  treatment, no particulars about them would be demanded from the\r\n  physician.

in part they are the external\r\nmanifestations of a =natural impulse=, of an instinctive excitement, in\r\nwhich form we see them also in other animals; in part they are connected\r\nwith man’s =spiritual= nature, with =civilization=. We may, indeed, say\r\nthat the duplex nature of man, his bodily-spiritual dualism, is most\r\nclearly reflected in this phenomenon of his sexuality. In this respect\r\nhe is wholly human.\r\n\r\nIt is a great service performed by Havelock Ellis[396] that he was the\r\nfirst to direct attention to the “involuntary” manifestations of the\r\nsexual impulse peculiar to mankind, occurring =without= relation to the\r\nother sex. He gives them the distinctive name of “=auto-erotism=,” by\r\nwhich he means “the phenomenon of spontaneous sexual excitement\r\nmanifesting itself =without any stimulus, direct or indirect, supplied\r\nby any other person=.” For the most part, therefore, the normal\r\nmanifestations of art and poetry belong also to the province of\r\nauto-erotism, in so far as they are the result of erotic perception; and\r\nthe same is true of all those manifestations which I have termed\r\n“=sexual equivalents=,” all transformations of sexual energy, such as\r\nreligio-sexual phenomena, the transformation of individual love into the\r\ngeneral love of mankind, the stimuli of fashion, and =every powerful\r\nactivity= by means of which sexual tension finds a mode of discharge,\r\neven though this sexual relationship is usually of an unconscious\r\nnature, as in the dance, in society games, and other enjoyments.\r\n\r\nIn my essay on “The Perverse,” pp. 14, 15 (Berlin, 1905), I have shown\r\nthat there is no doubt that these sexual equivalents, taken in their\r\nentirety, have played an extremely important part in the course of the\r\nevolution of mankind; that they represent =the natural outlets= for\r\nfeelings of tension and excessive forces of sexual origin; and that they\r\nshould not be unnecessarily suppressed, unless we wish to evoke =much\r\nworse and far more dangerous= variations of their activity--as, for\r\nexample, in the political sphere.\r\n\r\nAppositely, I find in Friedrich Nietzsche’s “Posthumous Works” (vol.\r\nxii. of the “Collected Works,” p. 149; Leipzig, 1901) an interesting\r\nremark bearing on the question:\r\n\r\n  “Many of our impulses find an outlet in a mechanically powerful\r\n  activity, which =can= be directed by intelligent purpose; unless this\r\n  is done, these manifestations are destructive and harmful. Hate,\r\n  anger, =the sexual impulse=, etc., can be =set to the machine= and\r\n  taught to do useful work--for example, to chop wood, to carry letters,\r\n  or to drive the plough. =Our impulses must be worked out.= The life of\r\n  the learned man more especially demands something of the kind.”\r\n\r\nWhat a wise and apt remark! Our whole civilization is permeated with\r\nsexual equivalents of this kind; the pleasure of life and the joy of\r\nexistence are based thereon, however much our puritans and asexual\r\n“morality-fanatics” may strive against this fact. And it is well that\r\nthe sexual impulse has been “civilized,” that there are now so many\r\nspontaneous modes of its discharge, that the sphere of auto-erotism\r\nincreases _pari passu_ with the growth of civilization. Many new, finer,\r\nand nobler incitations and stimuli stream therefrom into love and life,\r\nupon which they exercise a rejuvenating and strengthening influence.\r\nStill, this light throws a shadow, inasmuch as fantastic and unnatural\r\naberrations of the sexual life are also apt to ensue.\r\n\r\nAuto-erotism (including its grosser form, masturbation) is therefore, to\r\na certain extent, a =physiological= manifestation; it becomes morbid\r\nonly in certain conditions--that is to say, in individuals who are\r\npreviously =morbid=. This is, indeed, an old medical doctrine, that\r\nthere exists a physiological masturbation _faute de mieux_, and a morbid\r\nmasturbation in cases of neurasthenia, mental disorder, and other\r\ntroubles. The same is true of auto-erotism in its entire extent. When\r\nFürbringer describes masturbation as “an =unnatural= gratification of\r\nthe sexual impulse,”[397] this is only partly true. There exists a\r\n=natural, physiological masturbation=, a =normal= auto-erotism.\r\nMetchnikoff shares this view.[398] He says: “=It is man’s constitution\r\nitself= that permits the premature development of sexual sensibility,\r\nbefore the reproductive elements are mature.” The ultimate cause of such\r\nauto-erotic manifestations as belong neither to the category of “vice”\r\nnor to that of “crime” is to be found, he thinks, in a =disharmony= in\r\nthe nature of man in respect of the premature development of sexual\r\nsensibility. For this reason we meet with these manifestations just as\r\nmuch among the lowest races of mankind as we do among civilized\r\npeoples; even among =animals= auto-erotism is a widely diffused\r\nphenomenon. This can be observed, not only among the monkeys (perhaps\r\nalready a little civilized) of our Zoological Gardens, which masturbate\r\nfreely _coram publico_, but it may be seen also in horses, which shake\r\nthe penis to and fro until seminal emission occurs; also in mares, which\r\nrub themselves against any available firm object. We see the same thing\r\nin wild deer. Even elephants masturbate. Among primitive races\r\nmasturbation is, perhaps, even more general than among civilized races.\r\nAmong South African tribes, Gustav Fritsch reports, masturbation is\r\nactually a popular custom.\r\n\r\nHavelock Ellis has described the entire auto-erotic instrumentarium, and\r\nit appears from his account that savage races manufacture onanistic\r\nstimulatory apparatus for women quite as elaborate as those which are\r\nproduced by the most highly developed lewd industry of civilized\r\npeoples. Most frequently articles in everyday use are employed for\r\nauto-erotic gratification--as in Hawaii, bananas; in our own part of the\r\nworld, cucumbers, carrots, and beetroots. Further, in the vagina and\r\nbladder have been found pencils, sticks of sealing-wax, empty reels,\r\nbodkins, knitting-needles, needle-cases, compasses, glass stoppers,\r\ncandles, corks, tumblers, forks, toothpicks, pomade-boxes,\r\ncockchafers,[399] hens’ eggs, and, with especial frequency, =hairpins=.\r\n\r\nI may allude here, in passing, to the fact that C. Posner refers the\r\ndiscovery of various bodies in the male urethra to other causes than\r\nmasturbation in some cases. He states that often they have been\r\nintroduced by other persons than the one in whom they are found, and is\r\nof opinion that the introducer is a man with sadistic tendencies, and\r\nusually homosexual (see C. Posner, “The Introduction of Foreign Bodies\r\ninto the Male Urethra, with Remarks on the Psychology of such Cases,”\r\npublished in _Therapie der Gegenwart_, September, 1902). In the year\r\n1862 masturbation with the aid of hairpins was so widely practised in\r\nGermany that a surgeon invented a special instrument for the removal of\r\nhairpins from the female bladder! At the present day this hairpin\r\nmasturbation is extremely common.[400] Still more elaborate are\r\nartificial imitations of the male penis, the so-called _godemichés_\r\n(_gaude mihi_, _dildoes_, _consolateurs_, “_bijoux indiscrets_,”\r\netc.),[401] of which we find representations in ancient Babylonian\r\nsculpture, in Egypt, and in the “Mimiamben” of Herondas[402] (third\r\ncentury before Christ); and since very ancient times they have been in\r\nuse in Eastern Asia, where the Spaniards found them in the Philippines.\r\nParticularly well known are the wax phalli of the Balinesian women. In\r\nEurope, as early as the twelfth century, Bishop Burchard of Worms\r\ncondemned the use of artificial penes. Their use was especially common\r\nat the time of the Italian renascence; the technique of their employment\r\nbecame continually more elaborate. The culmination was reached in the\r\neighteenth century France. No less a man than Mirabeau, the celebrated\r\nFrench politician, in his erotic romance, “Le Rideau Levé, ou\r\nl’Education de Laure,” describes such an artificial phallus, and I\r\nappend his description in order to enable the reader to represent to\r\nhimself the extremely elaborate technique that was used in the\r\napplication of such auto-erotic instruments:\r\n\r\n  “The instrument resembled in every respect the natural penis. The only\r\n  difference consisted in this, that from the apex to the root it was\r\n  shaped in transverse waves, in order to render the rubbing action more\r\n  powerful. Made entirely of silver, it was covered with a kind of\r\n  smooth and very hard varnish, giving it the natural colours. For the\r\n  rest, it was very light and thin, being hollow. Through the middle of\r\n  the hollow interior there passed a round tube, made also of silver,\r\n  and about twice the diameter of a goose-quill, and within this tube\r\n  was a piston; the tube was firmly closed at the other end by means of\r\n  a screw. This screw was perforated, and firmly soldered to the base of\r\n  the head. Consequently there was an empty space between the central\r\n  tube and the outer wall of the instrument. This outer cavity of the\r\n  godemiché was filled with water warmed to blood-heat, and then closed\r\n  with a well-fitting cork. The small central tube was filled with a\r\n  thin, whitish solution of isinglass (!), which was previously\r\n  prepared. The warmth of the water was immediately communicated to the\r\n  isinglass solution; and the latter then represented, as far as was\r\n  possible, the human semen.”\r\n\r\nThis description dates from the year 1786! But even to-day apparatus of\r\nthis kind are advertised in the catalogues of certain traders, under\r\nthe title of “Parisian Rubber Articles.” Whether they really exist I do\r\nnot know, for I have never actually seen anything of the kind. Havelock\r\nEllis assumes that they are still used to-day. In brothels, prostitutes\r\nuse at the present time very primitive leathern phalli, such as were\r\ndescribed by Herondas and Aristophanes, for erotic practices and\r\ndemonstration.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these, there are numerous other methods of purely\r\nperipheral-mechanical masturbation. Thus, the rubbing and movement of\r\nthe genital organs in bicycle-riding, horse-riding, very frequently in\r\nworking the treadle of a sewing-machine, and in travelling on the\r\nrailway, may give rise to masturbatory stimulation. Very commonly in\r\nwomen merely rubbing the thighs against one another is sufficient to\r\ninduce a sexual orgasm; whereas men almost always need to have\r\nrecourse to more powerful manipulation, such as manual friction\r\n(_manustupratio_).\r\n\r\nWhat are the general physiological =factors= of auto-erotic phenomena,\r\nmore especially of masturbation? In this connexion it is interesting to\r\nnote that =auto-erotism is almost always a precursor of completely\r\ndeveloped sexuality=, and manifests itself a long time =before= puberty;\r\nand may even appear soon after birth, for the older and more recent\r\nmedical literature of the subject contains numerous observations of\r\nmasturbation in =sucklings=, not to speak of masturbation in older\r\nchildren. The auto-erotism of sucklings is =purely peripheral= in its\r\nnature, and depends upon the mechanical stimulation of certain parts of\r\nthe body, the first “erogenic” zones of man. Freud enumerates among the\r\nregions of the body by the stimulation of which sexual pleasure is most\r\nreadily obtained, the lips of the infant, which, in sucking the mother’s\r\nbreast or its substitute, receive an instinctive perception of pleasure,\r\nin which the stimulation produced by the warm flow of milk also plays a\r\npart. This “ecstatic sucking” of infants is auto-erotic in character.\r\nNot infrequently, while sucking in this voluptuous manner, the infant\r\nsimultaneously rubs certain sensitive parts of the body, such as the\r\nbreast and the external genital organs. A kind of orgasm occurs,\r\nfollowed by sleep. Freud aptly compares this phenomenon with the fact\r\nthat in later life sexual gratification is often the best means of\r\ninducing sleep. Freud also regards the masturbation of sucklings as\r\nbeing within certain limits a physiological phenomenon, as exhibiting on\r\nthe part of Nature an intention “to establish the future primacy of\r\nthese erogenic zones for sexual activity.”[403]\r\n\r\nWith the onset of puberty the auto-erotic instincts are newly\r\nstimulated; new sources of auto-erotism become active, principally owing\r\nto the development of the genital organs and to the evacuation of the\r\nreproductive products. Various theories have been propounded to explain\r\nby what means the =sexual tension= occurring at puberty is induced, this\r\nsexual tension being regarded as the ultimate cause of the masturbation\r\nof sexually mature human beings. The most plausible hypothesis is the\r\n=chemical= theory of sexual tension and sexual excitement, which was\r\nexplained in more detail above (p. 47). It may be that, as Freud\r\nassumes, a substance generally diffused throughout the organism is\r\ndestroyed by the stimulation of the erogenic zones, and that the\r\nproducts of decomposition of this substance give rise to a discharge of\r\nsexual energy; it may be that the reproductive organs themselves produce\r\nsuch chemical substances, =sexual toxins=. This assumption is supported\r\nby the experimental observation that when in animals the ovaries and all\r\nthe nerves connected with these organs have been removed, and\r\nconsequently the ordinary periodic recurrence of sexual activity is no\r\nlonger seen, if now ovarian extract is injected into the body of such\r\nanimals, rutting once more occurs. Starling introduced the term\r\n“=hormone=” to denote these chemical sexual substances. They appear also\r\nto play a part in connexion with certain abnormalities and perversions\r\nof the sexual impulse--a matter to which we shall return later. R.\r\nKossmann also speaks of a “=neuro-chemical=” injury--a kind of\r\nintoxication of the nervous system induced by “retained secretions or\r\nexcretions of the reproductive organs.”[404]\r\n\r\nThe same author also advances the =neuro-mechanical= theory of sexual\r\ntension. He understands by this that the purely mechanical =distension=\r\nof the organs belonging to the reproductive apparatus exercises a\r\n=mechanical stimulus= on the genital nerves, and thus has a reflex\r\naction upon the centres of the brain and spinal cord, which reflex\r\nstimulation is allayed by orgasm and ejaculation. Haig explains the\r\nfeeling of relief after masturbation, and the consequent discharge of\r\nsexual tension, as rather dependent upon the mechanism of the\r\nblood-pressure. He remarks:\r\n\r\n  “Since the sexual act gives rise to a low and falling blood-pressure,\r\n  it must necessarily alleviate conditions which are due to high and\r\n  increasing blood-pressure--for example, mental depression and\r\n  ill-humour--and if my observations are correct, we have here an\r\n  explanation of the relation between conditions of high blood-pressure\r\n  with mental and physical depression, on the one hand, and masturbatory\r\n  practices on the other, for such practices alleviate this condition,\r\n  and are readily indulged in for this purpose” (quoted by Havelock\r\n  Ellis).\r\n\r\nThe statement made to Dr. Garnier by a monk, thirty-three years of age,\r\nbears out this view:\r\n\r\n  “If no nocturnal seminal emissions occur, the tension of the semen\r\n  gives rise to general depression, headache, and sleeplessness. I admit\r\n  that sometimes, in order to obtain relief, I lie upon the abdomen, and\r\n  so produce a seminal discharge. I immediately feel =freed=, as if a\r\n  =burden= had been lifted from me, and sleep returns” (_ibid._, p.\r\n  273).\r\n\r\nSimilar motives for masturbation are alleged by many otherwise healthy\r\nonanists. They apply, moreover, in an equal degree to the normal, not\r\nexcessive, sexual intercourse of ordinary human beings. Persons\r\nbelonging to the most diverse classes of society--men of letters,\r\nshopmen, labourers, etc.--of whom I have inquired regarding the effect\r\nof seminal emissions, whether produced by masturbation or by coitus,\r\nhave unanimously agreed in describing to me this sense of “freeing” from\r\na burden, from pressure, from harmful substances accumulated in the\r\nbody--a sense of mental energy and creative power after such discharges\r\nof sexual tension not exceeding normal limits. The frequency of these\r\ndischarges varies in different individuals; in one the intervals were\r\nshort, in another they were long. This point has a very important\r\nbearing upon the “question of sexual abstinence,” and we shall return to\r\nit in the discussion of that topic.\r\n\r\nMasturbation is often the means for inducing sleep and repose; it dulls\r\nnervous sensibility, and connected with this is the fact that _pain_ is\r\noften allayed by masturbation. Here I may refer once more to the\r\npreviously quoted (p. 44) view of a talented young alienist, Edmund\r\nForster, that, in association with sexual tension, there occurs an\r\nincreased stimulation of the =pain-perceiving nerves= of the genital\r\norgans. It is conceivable that sexual tension, especially if it depends\r\nupon chemical causes, also increases pains arising from other areas of\r\nthe body, and that the discharge of sexual tension would thus alleviate\r\nor completely allay these pains. Coe reports (_American Journal of\r\nObstetrics_, 1889, p. 766) the case of a woman who was accustomed by\r\nmasturbation to obtain immediate relief of intense menstrual ovarian\r\npains. It is very remarkable that =these pains were accompanied by a\r\npowerful sexual impulse=, which ceased when the pain ceased, and did\r\nnot return during the intermenstrual period. Here we have a striking\r\ntestimony of the accuracy of Forster’s view. The phrenologist Gall was\r\naware of the manner in which masturbation relieves pain.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these more natural causes of masturbation, which in\r\nthemselves suffice to explain the wide diffusion of the practice, we\r\nhave also to consider masturbation dependent upon =seduction= and upon\r\n=morbid states=.\r\n\r\nTo seduction must be referred all the phenomena of =group-masturbation=\r\n(masturbation on the large scale) in =schools=,[405] training-ships,\r\nbarracks, factories (especially in this case as regards female\r\nemployees!), prisons, etc. One leads another astray, and masturbation is\r\ndiffused like an epidemic disease; the individuals are subjected to the\r\ninfluence of the =suggestion of the crowd=, which they are unable to\r\nresist. Thomalla describes boarding-schools in which masturbation was\r\npractised for a wager, and that boy won the prize in whom seminal\r\nemission first occurred! He further speaks of a school club in which\r\nobscene readings were held, and in which by means of forbidden pictures\r\nthe boys were sexually excited until erection occurred, then followed\r\ngeneral masturbation, also accompanied by wagers.\r\n\r\nThis group-masturbation is the best proof of the fact that those who\r\nmasturbate are not simply individuals with an inherited morbid\r\npredisposition; for nothing is easier to suggest than masturbation.\r\nHavelock Ellis[406] reports the following case of an unmarried healthy\r\nyoung woman, thirty-one years of age, which throws a strong light on\r\nthis suggested manifestation:\r\n\r\n  “When I was about twenty-six years of age, a female friend informed me\r\n  that she had masturbated already for several years, and was so much\r\n  enslaved by the habit that she suffered seriously from its\r\n  ill-effects. I listened to her account with sympathy and interest, but\r\n  felt rather sceptical, =and I resolved to make the attempt on myself=,\r\n  with the intention of understanding the matter better, so that I might\r\n  be able to help my friend. With a little trouble I =succeeded in\r\n  awakening what had hitherto slumbered in me unknown=. I intentionally\r\n  allowed the habit to become stronger, and one night--for I usually did\r\n  it just before going to sleep, never in the morning--I really\r\n  experienced an extremely agreeable sensation. But the next morning my\r\n  conscience was aroused, and I felt pains also in the back of the head\r\n  and along the spine. For a time I discontinued the habit, but later\r\n  began it again, masturbating with considerable regularity once a\r\n  month, a few days after each menstruation.... The habit overcame me\r\n  with alarming rapidity, and I soon became more or less its slave....\r\n  In conclusion, I must say that masturbation has proved to me one of\r\n  the blind chances in my life’s history, out of which I have derived\r\n  many valuable experiences.”\r\n\r\nFrequently local morbid changes in or near the genital organs lead to\r\nthe practice of masturbation, such as skin troubles, intestinal worms,\r\nphimosis, inflammatory states of the penis or near the entrance of the\r\nvagina, prurigo and other itching affections of the penis,\r\nconstipation, urinary anomalies, etc. Further, mental disorders,\r\nepilepsy, and degenerative nerve troubles, are frequent causes of\r\nmasturbation. Masturbation has been observed after epileptic paroxysms\r\nin patients who at other times never masturbate. There is no doubt that\r\nneurasthenia powerfully predisposes to masturbation. =Excessive=\r\nmasturbation is almost always the consequence, not the cause, of\r\nassociated neurasthenia; it is “the manifestation of a disease in\r\ncourse of development or of a permanently existing degenerative\r\npredisposition.”[407] To these cases of invincible, habitual, excessive\r\nmasturbation Oppenheim’s view applies--that the disposition to onanism\r\nis often =inherited=. A characteristic instance of this is offered by an\r\nobservation of Block’s (Havelock Ellis, _op. cit._, p. 240) in the case\r\nof a little girl, who began to masturbate at the early age of two years,\r\nand had probably inherited this tendency from her mother and\r\ngrandmother, for they had both masturbated throughout life, whilst the\r\ngrandmother had actually died in an asylum of “masturbatory insanity.”\r\nIn the majority of cases in which =masturbation makes its first\r\nappearance in sucklings= we have to do with such an inheritance. In many\r\ncases the peculiar oscillatory movements of sucklings may merely be the\r\nexpression of the sense of general comfort, as Fürbringer believes, and\r\nmay have nothing to do with actual masturbation; but, on the other hand,\r\nit cannot be denied that veritable masturbation may be observed in the\r\nfirst and second years of life. Havelock Ellis, J. P. West, and Louis\r\nMayer have reported such cases. In children somewhat older than\r\nthis--from three years upwards--seduction and suggestion certainly play\r\na great part. The author of “Splitter” was told by a professor that,\r\nwhen visiting an institution for small children in St. G[allen], he saw\r\na girl about three years of age who was making suspicious movements. The\r\nmatron, whose attention was called to the matter, said that almost all\r\nbabies were already infected when they first came to the institution\r\n(“Splitter,” p. 375).\r\n\r\nAnother disputed question relates to the =diffusion of masturbation in\r\nthe female sex=. Is the practice commoner or less common among women\r\nthan among men? Metchnikoff[408] is of opinion that in girls it is much\r\nless common than in boys, because sexual excitability generally develops\r\nmuch later in the female sex. Female monkeys masturbate only in\r\nexceptional cases, whereas in male monkeys masturbation is very common.\r\nThe circumstance which Metchnikoff adduces in further support of his\r\nview of the rarity of masturbation in women--that, namely, most girls\r\nare enlightened regarding sexual sensibility only after marriage--proves\r\nvery little, because the sensations aroused in woman by masturbation are\r\nof a very different nature from those produced by coitus, and coitus\r\noften first makes them acquainted with entirely new sensations. Tissot\r\nregards masturbation as commoner in women than in men; Deslandes\r\nbelieved that there was no difference between the sexes. Lawson Tait,\r\nSpitzka, and Dana, inclined rather to Metchnikoff’s view as to the\r\ngreater rarity of the practice among women. Albert Eulenburg considers\r\nmasturbation “not quite so common among young women as among young men,”\r\nbut still “far more common than parents, teachers, and the laity of both\r\nsexes as a rule imagine.”[409] Havelock Ellis considers that =after=\r\npuberty masturbation is commoner in women because men can then much more\r\nreadily obtain gratification in a normal manner by means of intercourse\r\nwith the other sex. Otto Adler estimates the frequency of masturbation\r\nto be very great, because he regards it as the principal cause of\r\ndeficient sexual sensibility in women, which latter condition he also\r\nbelieves to be extremely common, although he does not go so far as to\r\naccept Rohleder’s enormous proportion of 95 masturbators in every 100\r\nwomen (!).[410] L. Löwenfeld, who characterizes Rohleder’s and Berger’s\r\n(99 %) estimates as exaggerations, considers that the frequency of\r\nmasturbation in women is not so great as in men.[411] In reality,\r\nmasturbation, given similar circumstances and causes, is probably\r\ndiffused to an approximately equal extent among both sexes.\r\n\r\nBut this relates only to peripheral-mechanical masturbation; from this\r\n“=psychical onanism=” has rightly been separated--that form of\r\nmasturbation in which, simply by ideas, without the assistance of manual\r\nstimulation of the genital organs, sexual excitement is caused and the\r\norgasm is induced. Psychical onanism, of which Eduard Reich[412]\r\nremarked that our own time nourishes it to the fullest possible extent,\r\ndevelops in the majority of cases out of masturbation proper. In this\r\nform the =imagination= is tasked with representing all the factors of\r\nnormal sexual gratification. The simple physical act suffices only in\r\nthe first beginnings of this vice. Every practised onanist understands\r\nthat he must soon call his imagination to his aid in order to produce\r\nsexual gratification, and that ultimately ideas alone dominate the\r\nentire libido, and the orgasm often enough terminates an act which in\r\nevery respect has throughout remained purely ideal.\r\n\r\n  “So great is the power of imagination,” remarks the experienced\r\n  Rouband, “that quite alone, without the assistance of physical\r\n  stimulation, it can produce the venereal orgasm, with ejaculation of\r\n  the semen, as happened to one of my fellow-students every time he\r\n  thought of his beloved.”[413]\r\n\r\nHammond even knew an actual sect of such “onanists by means of simple\r\nideal unchastity,” who formed a sort of club or society, and who were\r\nknown to one another by certain signs.[414] A patient related to him\r\nthat in his thoughts of women whom he met, or those who were sitting\r\nopposite to him in the railway-carriage, he was accustomed to undress\r\nthem in imagination; he then would represent to himself very plainly\r\ntheir genital organs, and during this representation he experienced very\r\nactive voluptuous sensations, culminating in ejaculation. Löwenfeld has\r\nalso observed several such cases. Eulenburg speaks of an “ideal\r\ncohabitation.” The ideas are usually of a lascivious nature, but this is\r\nnot always the case. Von Schrenck-Notzing reports the case of a lady\r\ntwenty years of age in whom the simple idea of men, but also agreeable\r\nsensory perceptions, such as theatrical scenes, or musical impressions,\r\nor beautiful pictures, gave rise to the sexual orgasm.[415]\r\n\r\nAllied with psychical onanism is the brooding over sexual ideas--the\r\n_delectatio morosa_ of the theologians--and erotic excitement associated\r\nwith dream-imaginations, or “sexual day-dreams” (Havelock Ellis). This\r\nis the spinning out of a continuous erotic history with any hero or any\r\nheroine, which is carried on from day to day. Most commonly this occurs\r\nin bed before going to sleep. Sexual activities form the material of\r\nthese histories. We often find carefully worked out and more or less\r\nerotic day-dreams in young men, and especially in young women,\r\nfrequently containing perverse elements. This dreaming, according to\r\nHavelock Ellis, does not necessarily lead to masturbation, although it\r\noften induces seminal discharges. It occurs both in healthy and in\r\nabnormal persons, especially in imaginative individuals. Rousseau\r\nexperienced such erotic day-dreams. The American author Garland, in his\r\nnovel, “Rose of Dutcher’s Coolly,” has admirably described the part\r\nplayed by a circus-rider in the erotic day-dreams of a =normal healthy\r\ngirl= during the =period of puberty=.[416]\r\n\r\nIn close relationship with these psychical-onanistic day-dreams there\r\nstands another phenomenon, to which, as far as I know, I was the first\r\nto refer, which I have denoted by the term =erotographomania=.[417]\r\nThere are numerous men and women who induce their lovers--male or\r\nfemale, as the case may be--prostitutes, masseuses, etc., to write to\r\nthem =letters= with a sexually stimulating content; or also, as very\r\nfrequently occurs, they themselves write such letters, containing\r\nnumerous obscenities. Such correspondence, filled with ardent erotism,\r\nseems recently to have made its appearance as a peculiar refinement of\r\nsexuality; this also has the effect of a kind of psychical onanism. The\r\ninterchange of obscene letters of this character recently played a part\r\nin the trial of two homosexual individuals in East Prussia. There\r\nexists, also, a comparatively blameless, more or less physiological,\r\nerotographomania of the time of puberty, in which most passionate\r\nletters are written to imaginary lovers, and the still obscure sexual\r\nimpulse finds a satisfaction in these erotic imaginations.\r\n\r\nAfter this brief account of the various forms and varieties of\r\nmasturbation, we now turn to consider the =consequences= of the\r\npractice. In the course of time there has been a remarkable change of\r\nviews in respect of this matter. The true founder of the scientific\r\nliterature of masturbation, Tissot, in his celebrated monograph\r\n(“Masturbation; or, the Treatment of the Diseases that result from\r\nSelf-Abuse”; St. Petersburg, 1774), regarded masturbation as the evil of\r\nall evils, and deduced from it all possible severe troubles. His book\r\nbears as motto the verse by Von Canitz:\r\n\r\n   “Wenn schnöde Wollust dich erfüllt,\r\n    So werde durch ein Schreckensbild\r\n    Verdorrter Totenknochen\r\n    Der Kitzel unterbrochen.”\r\n\r\n  [“When base lust fills thy thoughts,\r\n    Let a horrible picture rise before thy mind\r\n    Of withered dead men’s bones,\r\n    So let the sensual stimulation be driven away.”]\r\n\r\nIt is dominated by a thoroughgoing pessimism. In this view he is\r\nfollowed by Voltaire, in his “Dictionnaire Philosophique,” and by the\r\nauthors of the first seventy years of the nineteenth century. Such\r\ngloomy views are expressed, above all, by Lallemand, in his celebrated\r\nbook upon involuntary losses of semen; but they are shared by German\r\nphysicians also, as, for example, B. Hermann Leitner, in his treatise,\r\n“_De Masturbatione_” (Buda-Pesth, 1844), and in the preface to his book\r\nwe read: “The writers who speak of the terrible results of self-abuse do\r\nnot exaggerate; on the contrary, their picture is not sufficiently\r\ngloomy.”[418] Modern medical science has, however, reduced these\r\nexaggerations to a reasonable measure. For this we have, above all, to\r\nthank W. Erb and Fürbringer. The old belief in the enormous dangers and\r\nthe eminent injuriousness of masturbation, still remains as a bugbear in\r\ncertain popular writings, some of which have been published in hundreds\r\nof editions. Who has not heard of the “Selbstbewahrung” (“Self-Abuse”)\r\nof Retaus,[419] the prototype of this dangerous literature, which must\r\nbe regarded as the principal source of sexual hypochondria; frequently,\r\nalso, it induces direct sexual stimulation, because it does indeed\r\ndescribe the devil, but describes also voluptuousness!\r\n\r\nAt the present day all experienced physicians who have been occupied in\r\nthe study of masturbation and its consequences hold the view that\r\n=moderate= masturbation in healthy persons, without morbid inheritance,\r\nhas no bad results at all. It is only excess that does harm; but even\r\nexcess in healthy persons does less harm than in those with inherited\r\nmorbid predisposition. I may express the matter in this way: it is not\r\nmasturbation (Ger. _Onanie_) that is harmful, but “=onanism=” (Ger.\r\n_Onanismus_)--that is to say, the habitual and excessive practice of\r\nmasturbation, continued for a number of years, =which certainly has an\r\ninjurious influence on health=. The boundary line at which the harmless\r\nmasturbation (_Onanie_) ceases and the injurious onanism (_Onanismus_)\r\nbegins cannot generally be defined. The difference between individuals\r\nmakes their reactions in this respect very different. For example,\r\nCurschmann reports the case of a talented and brilliant author who,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that he had masturbated to excess for eleven\r\nyears, remained physically and mentally vigorous, and pursued his\r\nliterary labours with notable success. Fürbringer reports a similar case\r\nin a University lecturer. The following case, which came under my own\r\nobservation, shows that even excessive masturbation need not impair\r\nhealth and working powers. A man of letters, forty years of age,\r\nprobably misled by a nursemaid in the first instance, had masturbated\r\nwithout intermission since the age of five, and since puberty had done\r\nso =several times a day= (three to ten times), without any interference\r\nwith his powers for work. He is a big, powerful, healthy man, of a\r\nreally imposing appearance. No one would suspect him to be a habitual\r\nmasturbator. That from the masturbation (Ger. _Onanie_) of childhood and\r\nyouth there developed a condition of formal onanism (Ger. _Onanismus_)\r\nin the adult is in this case principally to be ascribed to the continued\r\nabuse of alcohol. The patient drinks daily twelve to fourteen glasses of\r\nMunich beer. He is also a heavy smoker. No evidence of inherited\r\npredisposition to masturbation can be obtained. For the patient the\r\nfemale sex exists only in the imagination; he has very rarely had sexual\r\nintercourse, and avoids ladies’ society, although he has good fortune\r\nwith women. It is the same with masturbation as it is with sexual\r\nintercourse: the effects vary according to the individual. Recently\r\nmasturbation and coitus have been compared in this respect. Sir James\r\nPaget in his lecture on “Sexual Hypochondriasis” says: “Masturbation\r\ndoes neither more nor less harm than sexual intercourse practised with\r\nthe same frequency in the same conditions of general health and age and\r\ncircumstance.” Erb and Curschmann go even further; for they consider\r\nthat masturbation has less influence on the nervous system than coitus.\r\n=In reality=, however, masturbation is almost always more harmful than\r\ncoitus. The reasons for this are obvious. In the first place,\r\nmasturbation is begun much earlier, generally at an age when the body\r\nhas not yet developed any marked capacity for resistance. Masturbation\r\nin childhood is, therefore, especially harmful.[420] Löwenfeld (_op.\r\ncit._, p. 127) is of opinion that self-abuse begun before virility is\r\nattained more readily gives rise to weakness of the nervous system than\r\nmasturbation begun later in life. In neuropathic children he saw several\r\ntimes, as a consequence of masturbation, well-marked general\r\nnervousness, paroxysms of anxiety, sleeplessness, and arrest of mental\r\ndevelopment. In the second place, masturbation is more dangerous than\r\ncoitus in this way--that it can be carried out =much more frequently=,\r\non account of the more frequent opportunities, so that masturbation\r\nfour, five, or even more, times in a =single= day is by no means rare.\r\nIn the third place, the =spiritual influence= of masturbation is much\r\nmore harmful than that of normal coitus. The “solitary” vice influences\r\nthe psyche and the character in the mere child. The youthful masturbator\r\nseeks solitude, becomes shy of human beings, reserved, morose, unhappy,\r\nhypochondriacal. In the adult the sense of the debasing character and of\r\nthe sinfulness of masturbation is much more lively; self-confidence\r\ndeparts; the masturbator regards himself as absolutely “=enslaved=” by\r\nhis vice, the eternal =struggle= against the ever-recurring impulse\r\ngives rise more to mental depression than to actual physical harm. From\r\nthis there results a whole series of diseases of the will, for by\r\nmasturbation much less harm is done to the intellect than to the vital\r\nenergy, the capacity for spiritual and physical activity. The cold,\r\nblasé manner of many young men, who seem never to have known the natural\r\nyouthful joy of life, the whole “demi-virginity” of modern young\r\ngirls--all these are without doubt dependent upon masturbation and upon\r\npsychical onanism. The egoism of the onanist in the sexual relationship\r\nincreases his egoism in other respects, gives rise to cold-heartedness,\r\nand blunts the more delicate ethical perceptions. The campaign against\r\nmasturbation as a group manifestation is eminently a _social_ campaign\r\nfor altruism; it insists that young people should take their share in\r\nall questions relating to the common good. Peculiar extravagances and\r\nunnatural characteristics in art and literature may also be partly\r\nattributed to masturbation. Many works clearly bear its imprints. Thus\r\nHavelock Ellis rightly refers in this connexion to the peculiar\r\nmelancholy in Gogol’s stories, for Gogol masturbated to great excess. It\r\nwould be possible to mention also certain writings of our own time which\r\ninevitably give rise to such a suspicion.\r\n\r\nThe reader will do well to consult the interesting discussion of\r\nmasturbation from the philosophical standpoint by Schopenhauer (“Neue\r\nParalipomena,” ed. Grisebach, pp. 226, 227).\r\n\r\nThe =physical= consequences of immoderate and habitual masturbation may\r\nalso be really serious. The =eye= especially suffers manifold injuries,\r\nas has been proved by the investigations of Hermann Cohn. Irritable\r\nstates of the conjunctiva, spasms of the eyelids, weakness of\r\naccommodation, subjective sensations of light, and photophobia, may\r\nresult from masturbation. The =heart= also is sympathetically affected.\r\nKrehl even speaks of “=masturbator’s heart=” as a consequence of the\r\nlong-lasting nervous hyperexcitability, which injures the heart and the\r\nvessels, and is manifested by irregularity of the pulse and by\r\nsensations of pressure and pain in the cardiac region, by palpitation,\r\netc. Discontinuance of the habit leads to an immediate disappearance of\r\nall these alarming symptoms. Very important is also the causal connexion\r\nbetween masturbation and =nervous= or =mental disorders=. Here, however,\r\nas Aschaffenburg has recently insisted, we must distinguish clearly\r\nbetween masturbation =resulting= from previously existing\r\nnervo-psychical troubles, in which a vicious circle develops--for here\r\nthe masturbation is partly the consequence of the original trouble,\r\npartly the cause of an aggravation of this trouble--and the effects of\r\nonanism on the =healthy= central nervous system. Here Aschaffenburg is\r\nin agreement with the views of those who consider these effects are less\r\nserious than earlier writers were accustomed to assume. Aschaffenburg\r\nalso recognizes that the most harmful effect is to be found in the\r\n=psychical= influence of masturbation, in the continuous, but ever-vain,\r\ncontest against the habit. This is the source of the majority of the\r\nhypochondriacal and other troubles. He often succeeded, by the discovery\r\nof this psychical mode of origin, in putting an end to a number of\r\nmorbid manifestations. As soon as the patient =becomes aware= that these\r\nhave a purely mental cause, he at once feels himself freed from them.\r\nThat masturbation is =never= a direct cause of mental disorder is now\r\ngenerally recognized by alienists.[421] At the most, masturbation is no\r\nmore than a favouring element in the production of such disorder.\r\n“=Masturbatory insanity=” occurs only in those with marked hereditary\r\npredisposition, and who already have been extremely neurasthenic.[422]\r\n\r\nBut masturbation can unquestionably give rise to =purely local changes=\r\nin the genital organs, such as =inflammatory states of the prostate\r\ngland=, =spermatorrhœa=, and =prostatorrhœa=; in women =fluor albus=,\r\n=excessively painful menstruation=, and =other disturbances of the\r\nmenstrual function=, and in connexion with these phenomena there may\r\nappear the morbid picture of “=sexual neurasthenia=,” which we have soon\r\nto describe.\r\n\r\nA very serious result of onanism (not of _Onanie_) is the\r\n=disinclination to normal sexual intercourse= to which the habit gives\r\nrise, and the =production of sexual perversions=. The former is more\r\nmarked in the female sex, the latter more in the male sex. Masturbation\r\nis the principal cause of sexual frigidity in women and of a\r\ndisinclination to normal intercourse. Undoubtedly psychical influences\r\nhere play the principal part; but also a certain blunting of the\r\nsensations of the genital organs by means of excessive masturbatory\r\nstimulation. They are no longer susceptible to the normal stimulatory\r\ninfluence of coitus. Moreover, masturbation is often effected by\r\nstimulation applied to =some definite portion= of the female\r\nreproductive organs, most frequently to the clitoris or the labia; and\r\nthese parts in such cases are not sufficiently stimulated by coitus. In\r\nthe male the especially sensitive portions of the penis are stimulated\r\nalike by masturbation and in coitus, for which reason man,\r\nnotwithstanding the practice of masturbation, is much more readily able\r\nto obtain sexual gratification in the course of ordinary sexual\r\nintercourse. Notwithstanding this, there are also certain peculiar\r\nmethods of masturbation in the male, the effect of which is not attained\r\nby coitus. In such cases men also may fail to induce the sexual orgasm\r\nby ordinary intercourse.\r\n\r\nThe close relationship of masturbation to sexual perversions is obvious.\r\nThe more frequently the onanistic act is repeated, the more the normal\r\nsensibility is blunted, the stronger and more peculiar are the stimuli,\r\nwhich must be of a nature diverging from the ordinary, demanded in order\r\nto induce a sexual orgasm. The content of the lascivious ideas must be\r\nvaried more and more frequently, and soon passes entirely into the\r\nsphere of the perverse. Gradually these perverse sexual ideas become\r\nmore firmly rooted, and ultimately develop into complete sexual\r\n=perversions=. A classical example of this is the case reported by\r\nTardieu[423] of a man who was in the habit of =masturbating seven or\r\neight times every day=, and ultimately inflamed his imagination to the\r\npoint of representing the act of intercourse with female corpses. At\r\nlength he passed to the =practical carrying out= of this horrible idea,\r\nwhich had now assumed definite sadistic characters. He arranged to\r\nobtain a view of opened female bodies, killed dogs, dug up human\r\ncorpses--all in order thereby to provide satisfaction for his\r\nimagination, which had been disordered in consequence of masturbation,\r\nand thus to obtain sexual gratification. In the etiology of\r\npseudo-homosexuality masturbation unquestionably plays a part--a fact to\r\nwhich Havelock Ellis has drawn attention.[424] The Mexican “mujerados”\r\nare trained for pæderasty by means of masturbation repeated several\r\ntimes daily. Ideas of bestial intercourse may even be aroused by\r\nmasturbation. Von Schrenck-Notzing[425] reports the case of a woman who\r\nhad masturbated for thirty years, and ultimately came to represent to\r\nherself in imagination that she was having intercourse with a stallion.\r\n\r\nThe prospects of the satisfactory =treatment= and =cure= of masturbation\r\nare unquestionably greater in the case of children. To attain perfect\r\nsuccess, parents, teachers, and physicians must co-operate. Above all,\r\nit is necessary to relieve any local and general morbid conditions\r\nfavouring the practice of masturbation. The diet should be light and\r\nunstimulating, the clothing and bedding light and cool. In the year 1791\r\nthe body physician of the Schaumburg-Lippe family, Dr. Bernhard\r\nChristian Faust, published a remarkable work under the title “How to\r\nRegulate the Human Sexual Impulse,” with a preface by the celebrated\r\npedagogue J. H. Campe (Brunswick, 1791). In this book he maintained the\r\nthesis that the principal cause of masturbation in boys was the wearing\r\nof =breeches=. According to him, the =wrapping up= of children in\r\nswaddling clothes causes premature stimulation of the sexual organs.\r\nLater, in consequence of wearing breeches, there is produced “a great\r\nand damp warmth, which is especially marked in the region of the sexual\r\norgans, where the shirt falls into folds” (p. 46). Also, the boy, “when\r\nhe wishes to pass water, must take his little penis out of his breeches.\r\nAt first, and for a long time after he begins to wear them, the little\r\nboy cannot manage this himself; other children, maids, and menservants,\r\nhelp him, and pull and play with his sexual parts. By this handling,\r\npulling, and playing, which he himself does, or which others do for him,\r\nwith his sexual organs, the boy is led (also the girl, who very often\r\nassists, and whom the blameless boy, out of gratitude, wishes to help in\r\nreturn) into constant acquaintanceship with parts which he would\r\notherwise have regarded as sacred, unclean, and shameful. The child\r\nbecomes accustomed to play with his sexual organs, and =occasional\r\nmasturbation= develops into habitual self-abuse, =all brought about by\r\nwearing breeches=” (p. 45). To prevent all this, he suggested that boys\r\nfrom nine to fourteen years of age should wear clothing resembling\r\nrather that of girls. Then these children would be “according to Nature,\r\nchildren, and would ripen late; and the human sexual impulse would come\r\nunder control, and mankind would be better and happier” (p. 217).\r\n\r\nAlthough the far-reaching and systematic development of this thesis\r\nappears ludicrous, still, there is an element of truth in it, and\r\nunsuitably tight and warm clothing certainly favours the tendency to\r\nmasturbation.\r\n\r\nAccording to the suggestion of Ultzmann, in the case of nursing infants\r\nand of small children, the hands may be confined in little bags or tied\r\nto the side of the bed. The methods of the older physicians, who\r\nappeared before the child armed with great knives and scissors, and\r\nthreatened a painful operation, or even to cut off the genital organs,\r\nmay often be found useful, and may effect a radical cure. The =actual=\r\ncarrying out of small operations is also sometimes helpful. Fürbringer\r\ncured a young fellow in whom no instruction and no punishment had proved\r\neffective, by simply cutting off the anterior part of his foreskin with\r\njagged scissors. In the case of a young lady who often in company\r\nindulged her passionate impulse towards masturbation, he brought about a\r\ncure by repeated cauterization of the vulva. Other physicians perforate\r\nthe foreskin and introduce a ring. Cages have even been provided for the\r\ngenital organs to prevent masturbation, the key being kept by the father\r\n(!). Enveloping the penis in bandages without any opening has also been\r\ntried. Corporal punishment sometimes has a good effect. Of the greatest\r\nvalue is =continuous care, to safeguard the children against seduction=.\r\n“Parents, protect your children from servants,” exclaimed Rétif de la\r\nBretonne. Valuable also are =earnest warnings and explanations=,\r\n=increase of energy and force of will= (by sports and games, and by work\r\nin the garden, and by the setting of tasks which stimulate ambition).\r\n=Climatic cures= and =hydro-therapeutic methods= are also valuable\r\nmeans in the treatment of masturbation. The same measures may be\r\nemployed in the treatment of masturbation in =adults=. In their case,\r\nhowever, =psycho-therapeutics= plays the principal part. In many cases\r\nhere also local cauterization of the urethra and massage of the prostate\r\nmay bring about a cure. =Utterly perverse= would it be to introduce\r\nyouthful onanists to actual sexual intercourse, after the manner of the\r\nParisian “soup-merchants,” as the common speech names them, who, in\r\norder to cure their youthful scholars of masturbation, take them into\r\nbrothels.[426]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMasturbation is intimately connected with =irritable nervous weakness=,\r\nor “=neurasthenia=,” this typical disease of civilization, and more\r\nespecially with the genital form of the disease, “=sexual\r\nneurasthenia=.” In an analysis of 333 cases of neurasthenia Collins and\r\nPhilipp found that 123 cases--that is, more than one-third--resulted\r\nfrom overwork or from masturbation.[427] Freud, von Krafft-Ebing,\r\nSavill, Gattel, and Rohleder see in masturbation the true cause of\r\nneurasthenia. Fürbringer, Löwenfeld, and Eulenburg are of opinion that\r\nother injuries must also come into play in order to produce the typical\r\npicture of sexual neurasthenia. It is certain that very frequently the\r\norder of causation is reversed, =neurasthenia= being the =primary= and\r\nmasturbation the secondary disorder. Masturbation is then only a\r\n=symptom= of sexual neurasthenia. The same duplex mode of consideration\r\nmay also be applied to the other morbid phenomena of which the clinical\r\npicture of sexual neurasthenia is composed. Every one of these symptoms\r\nof irritable weakness, the excessive sexual excitability, the deficient\r\nsexual sensibility, the seminal discharges, and the impotence, can, like\r\nmasturbation, exhibit a certain =independence=, can be induced by\r\nvarious causes, and may lead to sexual neurasthenia; it may be, on the\r\nother hand, that they first developed in the soil of sexual\r\nneurasthenia. It is often impossible to determine the true =beginning=\r\nof the vicious circle. It therefore appears to be more practical to\r\ndescribe the morbid picture of sexual neurasthenia (which we owe to\r\nBeard)[428] according to its individual symptoms, as is done also by A.\r\nEulenburg[429] in an admirable essay, and by L. Löwenfeld in his\r\nwell-known work on “The Sexual Life and Nervous Disorders.”\r\n\r\nThe =abnormal increase in the sexual impulse= (=sexual hyperæsthesia=,\r\n=satyriasis=, =nymphomania=) begins at the point at which the normal\r\nsexual impulse is exceeded; and that point is subject to wide individual\r\nvariations, according to the age, race, habits, and external influences.\r\nThe normal sexual impulse can also be temporarily increased by special\r\ncircumstances--as, for example, by prolonged sexual abstinence, and by\r\nvarious kinds of erotic stimulation, without our being justified in\r\nspeaking of “hyperæsthesia.” This is always an abnormal condition, which\r\nmay be referred to various causes. It is more frequent in men\r\n(“satyriasis”) than in women (“nymphomania”); it may be permanent or\r\nperiodic; it almost always arises from lascivious =ideas=, and,\r\naccording to its cause, is accompanied by a greater or less diminution\r\nof responsibility, or even by complete lack of responsibility. The\r\nreadiness with which sexual ideas give rise to an abnormally increased\r\ndesire and to reaction on the part of the genital apparatus is\r\ncharacteristic of sexual hyperæsthesia; and this may attain such a\r\ndegree that the man (or woman) may really be “sexually insane,” and,\r\nlike the wild animals, rush at the first creature he meets of the\r\nopposite sex in order to gratify his lust; or he may be overpowered by\r\nsome abnormal variety of the sexual impulse, so that he seizes in sexual\r\nembrace any other living or lifeless object, and in this state may\r\nperform acts of pæderasty, bestiality, violation of children, etc. In\r\nthese most severe cases we can always demonstrate the existence of\r\nmental disorder, general paralysis, mania, or periodical insanity, and\r\nvery often of =epilepsy= (Lombroso), as a cause. In a more chronic and\r\nmilder form, sexual hyperæsthesia is observed after excessive\r\nmasturbation, often also in association with a congenitally neuropathic\r\nconstitution. Löwenfeld describes a peculiar form of =nocturnal= sexual\r\nhyperæsthesia occurring in married men, especially men in the forties or\r\nfifties, who for various reasons are compelled to abstain from conjugal\r\nintercourse, and who live continently. =In the daytime= these patients\r\nwere free from their trouble; it appeared only at =night=. Soon, or some\r\nhours after going to sleep, a =violent, painful, enduring erection of\r\nthe penis= (=priapism=) set in, which disturbed their sleep, and left\r\nthem in the morning with a feeling of enervation. In such a case\r\nobviously there is a hyperexcitability of the genital erection centre.\r\nThe erection results as a reflex effect of stimuli proceeding from the\r\ngenital organs, but manifests itself only when, during sleep, the\r\ninhibitions proceeding from the brain are in abeyance. This nocturnal\r\npriapism may, according to Löwenfeld’s observations, last for\r\nyears.[430]\r\n\r\nSexual hyperæsthesia in women, or “=nymphomania=,” is, in its slighter\r\nforms, also in most cases a consequence of excessive masturbation. Such\r\nwomen do not so much exhibit a more powerful inclination towards sexual\r\nintercourse, which, on the contrary, is incompetent to satisfy their\r\nabnormal and perverse sexual excitability. We rather see in them an\r\nimpulsion to obtain new sensations in their sexual organs in any\r\npossible way. These are the women who, for example, consult the\r\ngynæcologist as often as possible, because examination with the speculum\r\nor other manipulations induce in them sexual excitement. During the\r\nclimacteric--the time when menstruation ceases--such states are also met\r\nwith. Nymphomania proper always develops upon the foundation of severe\r\nneurasthenia and hysteria, or of direct brain and mental disorder. Then\r\nis produced the type of the “=man-mad=” woman, as described by Juvenal\r\nin the person of the Empress Messalina, who in the brothel gave herself\r\nto all comers, without obtaining complete satisfaction of her sexual\r\ndesire. Such types exist also at the present day. Thus, the brothers de\r\nGoncourt in their Diary reported the case of an old housekeeper who for\r\nseveral decades indulged in the most lascivious love orgies, had\r\ninnumerable lovers, and a “secret life full of nocturnal orgies in\r\nstrange beds, full of nymphomaniac lusts.”[431] There recently lived in\r\nCharlottenburg the wife of a workman, well known on account of her\r\nincredible sexual ardour and man-mania. Her husband, a professional\r\nstabber, was imprisoned for life. His wife often gave herself in a\r\nsingle day to four or five different men; every male creature that\r\napproached her she asked to perform the sexual act with her.--The\r\nfollowing almost incredible case of this nature is reported by Trélat:\r\n\r\n  Madame V., of a strong constitution, agreeable exterior, good-natured\r\n  manner, but very reserved, came under the care of Trélat on January 1,\r\n  1854. Notwithstanding the fact that she was sixty years of age, she\r\n  still worked very diligently, and hardly spared herself time for\r\n  meals. Nothing in her outward appearance or in her actions indicated\r\n  during her stay in the asylum that she was in any way affected with\r\n  mental disorder. During the four years not a single obscene word, not\r\n  a gesture, not the slightest passionate movement, indicated anger or\r\n  impatience.\r\n\r\n  Since her earliest years she has pursued handsome men and given\r\n  herself to them. When a young girl, by this degrading conduct she\r\n  reduced her parents to despair. Of an amiable character, she blushed\r\n  when anyone spoke a word to her. She cast her eyes down when in the\r\n  presence of several persons; but as soon as she was alone with a young\r\n  or old man, or even with a child, she was immediately transformed; she\r\n  lifted her petticoats, and attacked with a raging energy him who was\r\n  the object of her insane love. In such moments she was a Messalina,\r\n  whereas a few instants before one would have regarded her as a virgin.\r\n  A few times she met with resistance, and received severe moral\r\n  lectures, but far more often there was no obstacle to her desires.\r\n  Although various distressing adventures occurred, her parents arranged\r\n  for her marriage, in the hope thereby to put an end to the moral\r\n  disturbance. But her marriage was only a new scandal. She loved her\r\n  husband passionately; and she loved with the like passion every man\r\n  with whom she happened to be alone; and she exhibited so much cunning\r\n  and cleverness that she made a mock of any attempts at watching her,\r\n  and often attained her end. Now it was a manual worker busy at his\r\n  trade, now some one walking past her in the street, to whom she spoke,\r\n  and whom she brought home with her on any possible excuse--a young\r\n  man, a servant, a child returning from school! In her exterior she\r\n  appeared so blameless, and she spoke so gently, that every one\r\n  followed her without mistrust. More than once she was beaten or\r\n  robbed; but this did not prevent her continuing the same way of life.\r\n  Even when she had become a grandmother there was no change.\r\n\r\n  One day she enticed a boy, twelve years of age, into her house, having\r\n  told him that his mother was coming to see her. She gave him sweets,\r\n  embraced and kissed him, and as she then began to take off his clothes\r\n  and approached him with obscene gestures, the boy strove to resist\r\n  her. He struck her, and he related everything to his brother,\r\n  twenty-four years of age. The brother entered the house pointed out by\r\n  the boy, and abused the corrupt woman to the uttermost, saying: “In\r\n  such circumstances one helps oneself, without having recourse to law,\r\n  in order not to bring one’s name into disrepute by public proceedings.\r\n  I hope this disturbance will teach you not to behave in this way\r\n  again.” While this scene was going on, the woman’s son-in-law chanced\r\n  to come in, realized the situation before there was time to tell him\r\n  anything, and at once took sides with the incensed young man.\r\n\r\n  She was shut up in a convent, where she behaved in so good, sweet,\r\n  amiable, and modest a manner, that no one would have believed that she\r\n  had ever committed the slightest fault, and representations were made\r\n  to the effect that she ought to be allowed to return to her home. All\r\n  the inmates of the convent had been charmed by the zeal with which she\r\n  took part in the religious exercises. When she was free again, the\r\n  scandalous doings were immediately resumed, and so it went on all\r\n  through her life.\r\n\r\n  After she had reduced her husband and children to despair, they\r\n  finally hoped that age would extinguish the fire with which she was\r\n  consumed. They were mistaken. The more excesses she committed, the\r\n  more she wanted to commit, the more vigorous she appeared. It is\r\n  hardly credible that such debased ideas and habits should leave\r\n  intact such a sweet expression of countenance, a voice so youthful, a\r\n  behaviour so full of calm repose, and a glance of such clear\r\n  assurance. She became a widow. Her children, on account of her\r\n  horrible mode of life, could not any longer keep her at home, and they\r\n  sent her to a distant place, where they provided her with an\r\n  allowance. Since she was now old, she was at length compelled to offer\r\n  payment for the shameful services which she demanded; and as the small\r\n  allowance she received did not suffice for this purpose, she worked\r\n  with untiring zeal in order to be able to pay the great number of her\r\n  lovers.\r\n\r\n  To see the old, alert woman sitting at her work, as I myself saw her,\r\n  when aged seventy or upwards, without spectacles, always cleanly and\r\n  carefully, but not strikingly, dressed, with a simple and honourable\r\n  appearance, and an open countenance--to suspect her shameful mode of\r\n  life would never occur to anyone. Several of the wretched men who were\r\n  paid by her related how diligent she was. She assured Trélat of her\r\n  morality, in the hope that he would discharge her, and so enable her\r\n  to resume her mode of life. Trélat could not agree to this, and he\r\n  succeeded in obtaining from one of these men an accurate account of\r\n  her shameless loves.\r\n\r\n  This corrupt woman preserved her repose of manner, her excellent\r\n  appearance, and her honourable demeanour until her death. She died at\r\n  the age of seventy-four years from a cerebral hæmorrhage. There was no\r\n  remarkable change in the brain (_Journ. de Méd. de Paris_, 1889, No.\r\n  16).\r\n\r\nWith regard to the treatment of abnormal sexual hyperexcitability, the\r\nseverer forms--satyriasis and nymphomania--urgently need =asylum\r\ntreatment=. In the slighter forms favourable results will be obtained by\r\nmeans of psycho-therapeutics, the internal use of sedatives (such as\r\nmonobromide of camphor and bromide of potassium), regulation of the\r\ndiet, suitable clothing and bedding.[432]\r\n\r\nThe converse of sexual hyperæsthesia is =sexual anæsthesia=, or the\r\n=abnormal diminution of the sexual impulse=. It occurs in both sexes as\r\na =congenital= condition, owing in such cases to atrophy or absence of\r\nthe genital organs, after exhausting diseases, or in consequence of\r\narrest of development of the reproductive organs from unknown causes.\r\nThis latter condition is denoted by A. Eulenburg by the name of\r\n“=psycho-sexual infantilism=.” The same author also terms sexual\r\nanæsthesia “sexual loss of appetite.” It is commoner in women than in\r\nmen. It is often merely =apparent=--a pseudo-anæsthesia--because the\r\nman does not understand how to awaken the still slumbering sexual\r\nperceptions (_vide supra_, p. 86). Recently Otto Adler has written a\r\ncomprehensive and interesting monograph on this “Deficient Sexual\r\nSensibility in Women” (Berlin, 1904). According to him, the statement of\r\nGuttzeit, =that of ten women, four have no sensation at all “in coitu,”\r\nand submit to it without any agreeable sensation at all during the\r\nfriction, and without any intimation of the intense pleasure of\r\nejaculation=--that is, that 40 % of women suffer from coldness and lack\r\nof sensibility, from “=frigidity=”--is indeed somewhat exaggerated in\r\nrespect of the percentage; but still it is a correct expression of the\r\nfact that deficient sexual sensibility is much commoner in women than it\r\nis in men, in whom Effertz,[433] for example, estimates the frequency of\r\nfrigidity at only 1 %.[434] In women various circumstances explain the\r\nfrequency of deficient sexual sensibility. First of all, =masturbation=\r\nlowers sexual excitability in women much more than it does in man, and,\r\nabove all, it blunts sensibility for normal sexual intercourse, both by\r\nmeans of psychical influences and by the insensibility of the external\r\ngenital organs, owing to deficient stimulation of the clitoris during\r\nnormal intercourse, whereas this organ is most powerfully stimulated\r\nduring masturbation. Sexual frigidity also occurs in women in\r\nconsequence of maladroitness and brutality of the man _in coitu_, giving\r\nrise rather to pain than to voluptuous sensations, and very frequently\r\nbeing the cause of the first onset of the so-called =vaginal spasm=, or\r\n“=vaginismus=.”[435] It is also due in some cases to impotence on the\r\npart of the man.\r\n\r\nIn an interesting and valuable work, Carl Laker, in the year 1889,\r\ndescribed, as “A Peculiar Form of Perversion of the Sexual Impulse in\r\nthe Female” (German _Archives of Gynæcology_, 1889, vol. xxxiv., No. 3,\r\npp. 293 _et seq._), cases of sexual frigidity in woman _in coitu_, which\r\nare not to be regarded as cases of “anæsthesia sexualis,” since the\r\n=sexual impulse= was normal--indeed, frequently was increased--and it\r\nwas sexual gratification in normal intercourse which was completely\r\nwanting. In these cases gratification was obtainable only by simple or\r\nmutual onanism. There existed a normal inclination towards the other\r\nsex, associated with mental and physical health. The author assumes\r\nthat, in consequence of some anatomical abnormality, stimulation of the\r\nsensory nerves by which the voluptuous sensation is perceived,\r\nespecially those of the clitoris, failed to occur; but perhaps by a\r\nchange of posture _in coitu_ this stimulation can still be effected. The\r\ncase previously reported by me on page 86 belongs to this category of\r\n=relative= or =temporary= sexual anæsthesia; whereas in cases of genuine\r\n=absolute= sexual anæsthesia the sexual =impulse= also is in abeyance at\r\nthe outset, or disappears in consequence of excesses and in female\r\nlibertines and in prostitutes.\r\n\r\nThe =treatment= of deficient sexual sensibility in women must, above\r\nall, take into consideration psychical influences, and depends,\r\ntherefore, more on the husband or lover than it does on the physician;\r\nthe conditions of intercourse must be adapted to the particular\r\ncircumstances of the case (as by change of posture in coitus,\r\npreparatory tenderness, etc.). Painful sensibility in vaginismus can\r\nsometimes be cured by mechanical treatment, by the removal of painful\r\nremnants of the hymen, by the cure of small lesions, and also by\r\nextension by means of the speculum. It also appears, as is evidenced by\r\nan observation of Courty, that at the time of impregnation there occurs\r\na stronger stimulation and voluptuous sensation _in coitu_ in women who\r\nare at other times frigid.\r\n\r\nSexually frigid women of the lower classes are apt, as Effertz points\r\nout, to become prostitutes. During the practice of their profession they\r\nalways keep a cool head, because they are at first and always sexually\r\ninsensitive, and can devote their whole energy and regulate all their\r\nactions towards the plunder of the man. The following case reported by\r\nEffertz (_op. cit._, p. 51) illustrates this connexion very clearly:\r\n\r\n  “I was once consulted by a very highly placed hetaira on account of\r\n  supposed articular rheumatism. When I informed her of my diagnosis of\r\n  lues, she was greatly moved, and said to me that I should not\r\n  therefore think the worse of her. She was better than her occupation;\r\n  she had never followed it on account of evil passions; she was quite\r\n  insensitive; she had done it only in order to provide for her parents\r\n  freedom from care in the evening of their life, and to secure the\r\n  future of her small child. She also told me on this occasion that she\r\n  owed her success to her coldness, =for which condition she was\r\n  extremely thankful=. She never gave herself for less than 1,000 marks\r\n  (£50). At the same time, she made a mock of her colleagues--those\r\n  stupid and wicked girls who frequently, when their heads were fired by\r\n  champagne, would give themselves for nothing, and would even run after\r\n  men.”\r\n\r\nOtto Adler describes Madame de Warens, in Rousseau’s “Confessions,” as a\r\ntype of such a _femme de glace_. Frigid women marry with comparatively\r\ngreater frequency than women who are sexually very excitable, because\r\ntheir natural reserve endows them with greater value in the eyes of men,\r\nand also offers a certain security for their faithfulness. Such\r\nmarriages are naturally in almost all cases unhappy, for the man soon\r\ngrasps the true nature of the case, and since most will say with Ovid,\r\n_odi concubitus qui non utrimque resolvunt_, he seeks outside the house\r\nsome =response= for his love.[436] In some cases, indeed, frigid women\r\nmake a pretence of experiencing libido and the sexual orgasm, so that\r\nthe man is deceived. In some cases, also, notwithstanding a manifest\r\nfrigidity on the part of the wife, the marriage is none the less happy\r\nwhen the husband is partially or wholly impotent, and voluntarily\r\nrenounces coitus. Such a case I myself recently observed.\r\n\r\n  “The case was that of a merchant, physically and bodily in excellent\r\n  health, aged a little under forty years, who, since the eleventh year\r\n  of his age down to the present time, has continued to masturbate\r\n  (between the eleventh and eighteenth years of his life, twice daily).\r\n  He has often had ejaculation =without= erection. When twenty years of\r\n  age, he frequently attempted coitus, but could not obtain an erection.\r\n  Generally speaking, he never had an erection when his attention was\r\n  directed to the matter, but only without his co-operation, on other\r\n  occasions than those of attempted sexual intercourse. Thus, until his\r\n  engagement, in the thirtieth year of his age, he had never completed\r\n  normal coitus, but had only obtained sexual gratification by means of\r\n  masturbation, and therefore married with considerable hesitation,\r\n  although during the eleven months of his engagement he had masturbated\r\n  much less frequently. On the wedding-night, however, and later, it\r\n  =appeared= that his wife had a =natural disinclination to coitus=, was\r\n  =extremely frigid=, and only had traces of sexual sensation when, by\r\n  means of onanistic stimulation on the part of her husband, her libido\r\n  was slightly stimulated. Spontaneously she never felt any desire for\r\n  sexual gratification, not even in consequence of masturbation. The two\r\n  have lived for seven years in =most happy= married life, and love one\r\n  another tenderly, =without= ever having completed coitus. This\r\n  deficient sensibility in the wife, and her failure to respond, have\r\n  naturally not relieved the impotence of the husband, and he gratifies\r\n  himself now, as before, by solitary masturbation.”\r\n\r\nThis case proves that the capacity for love is to a certain extent\r\nindependent of the strength of the libido; frigid men and women can be\r\nthoroughly “erotic”; that is to say, they can experience the need for\r\ntenderness, just as “erotomania”--that is to say, the excessive longing\r\nfor love--is completely different in its nature from satyriasis and\r\nnymphomania (= excessive sexual desire).[437]\r\n\r\nJulius Pagel and other authors have recently drawn attention to the fact\r\nthat the condition of “erotomania”--excessive amativeness--was fully\r\ndescribed by the ancient and medieval physicians, who regarded it as a\r\nmorbid state. He published (in the _Deutsche Medizinal-Zeitung_, 1892,\r\np. 841) under the title, “A Historical Contribution to the Chapter of\r\n‘Cures by Disgust,’” the translation of a passage from the _Lilium\r\nMedicinæ_ of Bernhard von Gordon in Montpelier, a well-known and\r\nfavourite compendium of the beginning of the fourteenth century, in\r\nwhich, following the example of Avicenna, the _amor (h)ereos_ was\r\nnumbered among the _melancholicæ passiones_, and was considered to\r\nconstitute a particular section of the group of diseases of the brain\r\n(see the edition of the _Lilium Medicinæ_, p. 210 (Lyons, 1550)). It is,\r\nunfortunately, impossible here to deal at any length with the\r\nexceedingly instructive and remarkable contents. One of the methods of\r\ntreatment was to find an old hag as hideous and repulsive as possible,\r\nwho was to hold under the nose of the erotomaniac a chemise stained with\r\nmenstrual blood, saying at the same time, _talis est amica tua_. We may\r\nremark, in passing, that this genuine medieval “cure by disgust”\r\ndiverges, much to its disadvantage, from the manner in which in\r\nantiquity (three centuries before Christ) Erasistratos, the pupil of\r\nAristotle, a celebrated physician of the Alexandrian school, cured the\r\nson of King Antiochus, who had fallen in love with his stepmother\r\nStratonica. An account of the ancient therapeutic art is also to be\r\nfound in another work by J. Pagel, “Introduction to the History of\r\nMedicine” (Berlin, 1898). In a comprehensive work, “The History of Love\r\nConsidered as a Disease,” this topic has recently been considered by\r\nHjalmar Crohns. Here we have a theme the literature of which is very\r\nextensive, and which might be suitably dealt with in a special treatise.\r\n\r\nIn the male, sexual frigidity in the majority of cases is associated\r\nwith sexual weakness or with impotence--that is to say, with the\r\nimpossibility of copulating or of procreation. The former variety of\r\nsexual incapacity (_impotentia cœundi_) is, properly speaking, peculiar\r\nto the male. The second form--true “sterility” (_impotentia\r\ngenerandi_)--occurs in women as well as in men.\r\n\r\nIn the case of male impotence, various symptoms, preliminary\r\ndisturbances, and associated phenomena, make their appearance, and these\r\nwe shall have to describe separately, since they often occur as\r\nindependent disorders.\r\n\r\nThis is, above all, true of the =outflow of sexual secretions from the\r\nurethra=, =seminal losses= (=pollutions=[438] and =spermatorrhœa=), and\r\nthe evacuation of the =secretion of the prostate gland=, the so-called\r\n“=prostatorrhœa=.” The literature of these conditions, which are partly\r\nphysiological (as a proportion of pollutions) and partly morbid, is\r\nenormous. Of fundamental importance, notwithstanding the serious\r\nexaggerations of the author, is the celebrated work of Dr. M. Lallemand,\r\n“Involuntary Losses of Semen.” In recent times this important province\r\nof sexual pathology has been more especially advanced by the researches\r\nof leading German physicians, above all by those of Curschmann and\r\nFürbringer.\r\n\r\nThe most important question with regard to seminal losses or pollutions\r\nin any case is this: have we to do with physiological processes, lying\r\nwithin the range of health, or have we to do with morbid processes?\r\n\r\nAs normal, not morbid, seminal losses Lallemand regarded pollutions in\r\n=healthy, sexually mature, continent= individuals, occurring\r\n=spontaneously during sleep=, associated with =erection= of the penis\r\nand voluptuous sensations. He rightly regarded these as physiologically\r\nnecessary, indicated their purpose to be the discharge of sexual\r\ntension, the prevention of an excessive accumulation of the reproductive\r\nproducts, and compared their effect with that of hæmorrhages from the\r\nnose, which are so common in youth, and in most cases are distinctly\r\nbeneficial. But he drew attention to the =indeterminate, fluctuating\r\nboundary-line= between normal and morbid pollutions. This latter point\r\nof view is dealt with also by Eulenburg (“Sexual Neurasthenia,” p. 171),\r\nin opposition to other authors who regarded all pollutions, even the\r\nphysiological, as abnormal. In practice, however, it is generally not\r\ndifficult to distinguish between physiological and morbid seminal\r\nlosses. The former are characterized, not only by the distinctive signs\r\nalready mentioned, but also by their occurrence =at longer intervals=,\r\nand by the =absence= of any disadvantageous effect upon the general\r\nstate of health. As soon as pollutions have such a deleterious influence\r\nthey are morbid; and they are generally morbid when they occur\r\nabnormally =early=, before puberty, with abnormal =frequency=, at\r\nabnormal =times of the day=, and in association with abnormal\r\n=conditions of the genital organs=. According to Fürbringer, the normal\r\nintervals between pollutions in the case of continent youths vary\r\nbetween ten and thirty days. Löwenfeld considers pollutions occurring\r\nonce a week, and even the transient occurrence of pollutions on several\r\nsuccessive nights, as a result of sexual excitement, as being still\r\nwithin normal bounds. But if these repeated pollutions within a single\r\nweek, or even within a single day, continue =for a long time=, we are\r\nalways concerned with morbid pollutions. These sometimes occur not only\r\nat night, but also--a fact to which the German physician Wichmann, in\r\nhis dissertation _De Pollutione Diurna_ (Göttingen, 1782), drew\r\nattention--they occur =by day= (“diurnal pollutions”), in the waking\r\nstate, without masturbation or coitus, upon slight mechanical or\r\nphysical stimulation. In such cases erection of the penis is often\r\ncompletely =wanting=; ejaculation of the semen takes place with the\r\norgan flaccid, and even without any voluptuous sensation. In many cases,\r\nindeed, these pollutions are accompanied by actual =painful= sensations\r\nin the genital organs, and instead of voluptuous dreams or thoughts, the\r\nnocturnal ejaculation is accompanied by anxious dreams, the daylight\r\npollution by an extremely disagreeable sensation. Commonly in these\r\npollutions ordinary semen is at first evacuated--a mixture of the\r\nsecretions of the testicles, the prostate, the vesiculæ seminales, and\r\nCowper’s glands--containing numerous =spermatozoa=. After the trouble\r\nhas lasted a long time the semen becomes thinner (owing to its\r\ncontaining a smaller proportion of the thick testicular secretion) and\r\nmore transparent; the spermatozoa are less numerous and mostly\r\nundeveloped, and ultimately they may be completely absent. Löwenfeld\r\nobserved a peculiar form of pollution in which the semen was ejaculated\r\nonly in drops, or might be =completely wanting=--that is to say, there\r\nmight be a pollution =without= ejaculation, purely a voluptuous\r\norgasm.[439]\r\n\r\nIn such cases Löwenfeld was able to prove that it is not the loss of\r\nsemen which weakens, as Lallemand assumed, but that it is the =nervous\r\ndisturbance= of the lumbar spinal cord which plays the principal part.\r\nThis irritable weakness of the lumbar spinal cord may have existed\r\nfor a long time before, or may have developed only as the result of\r\nrepeated pollutions or of excessive sexual excitement; it may give\r\nrise, not only to proper seminal emissions, but, in addition,\r\nto “=spermatorrhœa=”--that is to say, to the =outflow of semen\r\naccompanying urination or defecation=; and it may also cause the rarer\r\n“=prostatorrhœa=”--the outflow of the secretion of the prostate gland. A\r\nlong duration of all these morbid discharges has a serious effect on the\r\nhealth, and induces the typical picture of sexual neurasthenia. As a\r\n=cause= of seminal losses we must mention masturbation, excessive sexual\r\nintercourse, chronic inflammation of the urethra (especially after\r\n=gonorrhœa=), stricture of the urethra, rectal affections, alcoholism,\r\ndiabetes, and tabes dorsalis.\r\n\r\nIn =women=, also, =processes analogous to pollution= may be observed,\r\nalthough much more rarely than in men, and generally as a consequence of\r\nmasturbation practised for several years. According to Adler (_op.\r\ncit._, p. 130), pollutions--that is to say, evacuations of the secretion\r\nof the vaginal glands and of the uterine mucous membrane, as well as of\r\nthe secretion of Bartholin’s glands near the vaginal inlet--never occur\r\nin chaste and intact virgins, but only in women who have already learned\r\nthe enjoyment of sexual intercourse, and who are subsequently compelled\r\nto lead a continent life. For this reason pollutions are a “trouble of\r\nyoung widows,” and occur in young girls only when they have learned to\r\nknow the nature of sexual pleasure by means of masturbation. Eulenburg\r\nremarks (“Sexual Neurasthenia,” p. 174):\r\n\r\n  “In connexion with lascivious dreams there occur spontaneous, more or\r\n  less abundant, discharges of the clear muco-gelatinous secretion of\r\n  the glands. These form a striking manifestation of sexual\r\n  neurasthenia in women, and can be compared with the morbid pollutions\r\n  occurring in similar circumstances in male neurasthenics. We hear less\r\n  about them, however, and they are insufficiently known, even by\r\n  medical men. For this reason especially, when they occur in\r\n  association with physical virginity and a normal genital condition in\r\n  other respects, they do not usually receive sufficient attention.”\r\n\r\nThe older physicians, especially those of the eighteenth century,[440]\r\ndescribed these pollutions in women very well and thoroughly; in erotic\r\nand pornographic literature they have always played a great part. An\r\ninteresting observation on peculiar processes analogous to pollutions is\r\nreported by Paul Bernhardt.[441] A hysterical sempstress, twenty-five\r\nyears of age, as the result of any kind of =annoyance=, experienced\r\nsexual excitement completely resembling the sensation of sexual\r\nintercourse, and ending with a discharge of mucus. This was, however,\r\nnever accompanied by any trace of voluptuous sensation; on the contrary,\r\nit gave rise to lumbar pains. Also, when she dreamed of anything\r\n=disagreeable= or had =nightmare=, this condition recurred. Erotically\r\nthe patient is very indifferent, and denies the practice of\r\nmasturbation.\r\n\r\nTo the category suggested by P. Bernhardt of sexual excitement induced\r\nby anxiety and trouble belongs the case reported to me by Dr. Emil Bock\r\nof a boy of fifteen years of age, who, when very anxious about his\r\ninability to complete a school task, experienced an ejaculation for the\r\nfirst time. To the literature of impotence belongs the work by Nicolo\r\nBarrucco, “Sexual Neurasthenia, and its Relations to the Diseases of the\r\nGenital Organs.” Regarding physiological pollutions, and the trifling\r\ndifference between them and normal seminal discharge during coitus,\r\nSchopenhauer makes some apt observations in his “Neue Paralipomena,” pp.\r\n230, 231.\r\n\r\nIn the =treatment= of pollutions, which always demands the most careful\r\nmedical observation and examination of the individual case, the most\r\nimportant measures are =dietetic and hygienic treatment=, =change of\r\nscene= from town to =country=, and especially to =mountain air=,\r\nmethodical =hydrotherapeutic measures=, =warm baths=, =massage=,\r\n=electricity=, =hyperalimentation=, the use of =bromides=, =local\r\ntreatment of the urethra=, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThe last and most important of the phenomena connected with sexual\r\nneurasthenia is =sexual weakness= or =impotence= in its various\r\nforms.[442]\r\n\r\nWe distinguish in the male =two principal forms= of impotence: (1)\r\n“=Impotentia coeundi=”--that is, incapacity for erection of the penis\r\nand the completion of coitus; (2) “=impotentia generandi=”--that is, the\r\nimpossibility of fertilization (owing to want of semen or to the lack of\r\nfertilizing quality in this fluid).\r\n\r\nCongenital malformations of the genital organs giving rise to impotence\r\nare extremely rare. Gyurkovechky, amongst 6,000 men fit for military\r\nservice, found three such men only. More frequently are =acquired=\r\ndefects met with as causes of impotence, such as complete or partial\r\nloss of the penis and testicles, as in eunuchs and castrated persons. It\r\nis well known that, notwithstanding the removal of the external genital\r\norgans, sexual desire may persist; and when the penis is retained,\r\nthough the testicles have been removed, erection and copulation are\r\npossible, providing the castration was effected after puberty. But it is\r\nobvious that in most cases potency is very markedly interfered with, and\r\nultimately it may entirely disappear. More light is thrown on the\r\nquestion by the occurrence of impotence after =unilateral= castration. A\r\ntragical case of this latter kind is reported by von Gyurkovechky (_op.\r\ncit._, p. 71):\r\n\r\n  “A former colleague of mine at the University of Vienna had to have\r\n  one of his testicles removed in consequence of obstinate inflammation\r\n  resulting from gonorrhœa; thereafter the second testicle underwent\r\n  complete atrophy. The much-to-be-pitied, handsome, elegant, and\r\n  amiable young man remained for some years capable of performing\r\n  coitus, was greatly pleased with himself for this reason, and paid\r\n  ostentatious court to ladies. Still, he was seldom in a position to\r\n  perform coitus, and after three years he completely withdrew himself\r\n  from the society of ladies, and became gradually morose and reserved,\r\n  until one day he disappeared from Vienna, discontinued his studies,\r\n  and never let any of us hear from him again. This case has remained\r\n  very vividly in my memory, and it illustrates most clearly the\r\n  influence of virile potency upon the entire being of the individual.”\r\n\r\nIf the second testicle remains intact, the capacity for sexual\r\nintercourse is not interfered with; and reproductive capacity also\r\npersists, although it may be diminished in degree.\r\n\r\nAn important source of sterility in the male, in which the capacity for\r\nsexual intercourse remains unimpaired, is =bilateral epididymitis=,\r\nconsequent upon =gonorrhœa=. This represents more than 50 % of all the\r\ncases of incapacity for procreation in the male. Finger found in 85 % of\r\ncases of epididymitis that the =spermatozoa were absent from the semen=\r\n(the so-called “=azoospermia=”); and Fürbringer is led by his own\r\nexperience to believe that 80 % of men who have had double epididymitis\r\nare incapable of procreation. Thus we may really speak of “=gonorrhœal\r\nsterility in the male=.” In many sterile marriages the fault lies with\r\nthe husband, as was first clearly proved by F. Kehrer’s fundamental\r\ninvestigations. And the no less momentous gonorrhœal sterility in women\r\nis also, in the majority of cases, ultimately dependent upon the\r\nhusband, who has presented his wife with “gonorrhœal infection as a\r\nwedding gift.”[443]\r\n\r\nAn extremely =small size= of the penis, also a =relatively small size=\r\nof this organ in cases of obesity and tumours, =malformations= of the\r\npenis, also the by no means rare mechanical hindrances to erections due\r\nto injuries and indurations in the corpora cavernosa (especially as a\r\nresult of gonorrhœal inflammation)--all these may make coitus\r\nimpossible. Fürbringer and Finger have also seen peculiar chronic\r\nshrinking processes of the corpora cavernosa occur independently of\r\ngonorrhœa and tumours. All these conditions give rise to =incomplete=\r\nerection, in which the penis is bent at an angle at some point or other,\r\nor is curved, so that it cannot be introduced into the vagina (chordee).\r\n\r\nAll the hitherto described forms of impotentia coeundi are less frequent\r\nthan those =in which the external genital organs are completely intact=,\r\nand in which we have to do simply with =imperfection= or =complete\r\nfailure of erection= in consequence of various =general disorders=.\r\n\r\nErection of the penis is induced both =centrally= from the brain (by\r\nvoluptuous ideas), and from the spinal cord (by direct stimulation),\r\nand also =peripherally= from the genital organs (by friction of the\r\nglans penis), by stimuli proceeding from the urethra, bladder, prostate,\r\nseminal vesicles, rectum, and the neighbourhood of the genital organs\r\n(as, for example, the buttocks), and may be either of a morbid or of a\r\nphysiological character. When there are inflammatory conditions of the\r\ngenital organs, especially gonorrhœa of the anterior and posterior\r\nurethra, erections occur very readily. From the full bladder there also\r\nproceed stimuli giving rise to erection, thus inducing the well-known\r\n“=morning erection=,” utilized by many who would otherwise be completely\r\nimpotent. Blows on the buttocks also give rise to erections--a subject\r\nto which we shall return when we come to discuss flagellation.\r\n\r\nThe =nature= of erection can be very briefly described as consisting in\r\na stiffening of the penis by the profuse =streaming of blood= into the\r\n=reticular spaces= of the =corpora cavernosa=, enlarged by =stimulation=\r\nof the =erection nerves=. The consequent erection of the penis is\r\ndependent upon the action of a particular muscle--the ischio-cavernosus\r\nmuscle.\r\n\r\nImpotence when the external organs are intact is in most cases due to\r\ncentral causes, and ultimately to psychical causes, even though severe\r\nbodily affections or local morbid states play a predisposing part (the\r\nso-called “=functional impotence=”).\r\n\r\nThis impotence is sometimes one of the =earliest= symptoms of =diabetes\r\nmellitus= and of =chronic Bright’s disease with contracted kidney=, also\r\nof =severe conditions of exhaustion=--to which consumption offers a\r\nsignificant exception, signalized already by the old saying, _phthisicus\r\nsalax_--of =obesity=, and of =tabes dorsalis=, in which the sexual\r\npotency gradually disappears, but libido outlasts the capacity for\r\nerection. Certain =poisons= also particularly damage potency. This is\r\nespecially the case with =alcohol=, the deleterious influence of which\r\non potency has already been described (pp. 293, 294). Georg Hirth goes\r\nso far as to recognize a special “=impotentia alcoholica=.”\r\n\r\n  “Above all, no alcohol,” says he, “especially not as a means for\r\n  producing erection. In youth a man needs no such stimulus, and in age\r\n  he will be apt to find, with the porter in Shakespeare’s ‘Macbeth’\r\n  (Act ii., Scene 3), that ‘drink may be said to be an equivocator with\r\n  lechery,’ for, as he says, ‘it provokes the desire, but it takes away\r\n  the performance; it makes lechery, and it mars him; it sets him on and\r\n  takes him off; it persuades him and disheartens him; makes him stand\r\n  to and not stand to: in conclusion, equivocates him into sleep, and,\r\n  giving him the lie, leaves him.’”[444]\r\n\r\n\r\nFürbringer’s view, that alcohol, taken up to the degree of slight\r\nintoxication, rather increases potency, in connexion with which he\r\nrefers to sexual invalids who are only able to perform sexual\r\nintercourse in a state of moderate intoxication, cannot be regarded as\r\ngenerally true. It is possible that in these admitted sexual invalids\r\nalcoholic intoxication overcomes =stronger psychical inhibitions=, which\r\nin the state of sobriety had hindered erection. For the normal\r\nindividual alcohol is not a means for the increase of sexual potency,\r\nbut the reverse.\r\n\r\n=The free use of tobacco= certainly also impairs sexual potency.[445]\r\nNicotine and love are as little compatible as alcohol and love.\r\nFürbringer, Hirth, and Eulenburg, ascribe to the excessive use of\r\ntobacco a diminution in sexual potency. The following interesting\r\npassage is from the Diary of the De Goncourts (_op. cit._, p. 89):\r\n\r\n  “=There is an antagonism between tobacco and women. The taste for one\r\n  diminishes the taste for the other=. So true is this, that passionate\r\n  Lotharios usually give up smoking, =because they feel or believe that\r\n  tobacco diminishes their sexual appetite and their powers of love=.”\r\n\r\n=Coffee= and =tea=, taken in excess, and, above all, =morphine=, are\r\nalso antagonistic to potency. Dupuy has observed the frequent occurrence\r\nof impotence in men who were in the habit of drinking large quantities\r\nof strong coffee (five or six breakfast-cups every day). Sexual potency\r\nreturned as soon as the use of coffee was discontinued; whilst when the\r\nuse of the beverage was resumed the impotence again appeared (_Comptes\r\nRendus de la Société de Biologie_, 1886, No. 27).\r\n\r\nThe majority of cases of functional disturbances of potency depend upon\r\nnervous impotence. It is the form which at the present day the physician\r\nmost frequently encounters. It is intimately connected with the state of\r\n“irritable nervous weakness,” or sexual neurasthenia, the most important\r\nsymptom of which is represented by “psychical” impotence. There exist,\r\nalso--and this justifies the independent consideration of psychical\r\nimpotence--numerous cases of impotence =without= neurasthenia\r\n(Fürbringer). This remarkable form occurs especially in perfectly\r\n=healthy= young =husbands=, who often before were completely potent, and\r\nhad previously effected coitus in a perfectly normal manner, or had\r\nlived a quiet, continent life, without having injured themselves in any\r\nway by masturbation. Such individuals, in consequence of the excitement,\r\nshame, and embarrassment of the wedding-night, often suffer from\r\npsychical impotence. Réti[446] speaks of “=impotence due to\r\ncompassion=,” arising from “the sympathy felt with the pains suffered by\r\nthe still virgin wife” when the attempt at coitus is made.\r\n\r\n  “The young married pair kiss one another and vie with one another in\r\n  tenderness, but when the matter becomes serious--when the husband\r\n  wants to enjoy his rights as a husband--the wife experiences\r\n  incredible anxiety; she trembles in all her limbs, writhes, screams,\r\n  and weeps. The man becomes exhausted, and at length, when the wife is\r\n  resigned, and willing to surrender herself to her fate, he has become\r\n  unfitted for his share in intercourse.”\r\n\r\nIt is clear that these forms of psychical impotence, which appear in\r\nvery various shades, are mostly transient phenomena, and exhibit a good\r\nprospect of complete cure.\r\n\r\nMuch more difficult is the matter when we have to do with cases,\r\nbecoming commoner every day, of psychical impotence in consequence of\r\n=sexual perversions=. Sadistic, masochistic, fetichistic, and homosexual\r\ninclinations may, in certain individuals, predominate to such an extent\r\nthat either copulation cannot be effected without the =preliminary=\r\ngratification of these perverse instincts, or else the latter =entirely\r\nusurp the place= of normal coitus, which has become, generally speaking,\r\nquite impossible (relative and absolute psychical impotence in\r\nconsequence of sexual perversions). To the former category belong, for\r\nexample, those cases, which are by no means rarely seen, in which\r\nhomosexual persons are only able to have intercourse with their wives\r\nafter preliminary caresses by their male friends; or masochists must be\r\nsubjected to a preparatory flagellation in order to become potent. In\r\nthe second category copulation has become quite impossible; the orgasm\r\ntakes place only in connexion with the activity of the perverse impulse,\r\nand there often exists an actual repugnance to normal coitus.\r\n\r\nWell known also is that rare relative psychical impotence in which the\r\nman can perform coitus only with =prostitutes=, whereas he is impotent\r\nas regards decent women. This, however, may often be associated with the\r\nexistence of sexual perversions, which are gratified only during\r\nintercourse with prostitutes.\r\n\r\nAnother form of relative psychical impotence is =temporary= impotence,\r\nin which the potency is entirely subject to =custom=, and a change in\r\nthe custom induces impotence. Thus, Frenzel reports the case of a man\r\nwho had always had intercourse with his wife immediately on going to\r\nbed, and proved completely impotent when this habit was interrupted, and\r\nhe now wished to perform the act early in the morning. Only gradually\r\ndid he recover his lost potency and become able to adapt himself to the\r\nchanged conditions.[447]\r\n\r\nAnother form of impotence by no means rare, and occurring in otherwise\r\nhealthy men, is that produced by powerful =mental= activity or\r\n=artistic= production, the impotence of literary men and of artists. It\r\nis usually of a transient nature,[448] manifesting itself only during\r\nthe periods of intellectual activity, and it is explicable in accordance\r\nwith the law of sexual equivalents, according to which the sexual\r\npotency appears in the latent form of spiritual productive activity. A\r\nremarkable case of this impotence of literary men is reported by the\r\njust quoted Frenzel.[449] Allied with this variety of impotence is the\r\nform due to transient =mental distraction=, to =instantaneous ideas=,\r\nwhich suddenly act as psychical inhibitions. These sudden ideas can be\r\nof a very varied content--joyful, sad, anxious, annoying; in every case\r\nthey are capable of annulling the =already existing potency=, and of\r\nmaking the further erection of the penis impossible. Such conditions\r\noccur alike in healthy persons and in those who are readily excitable\r\nand neurasthenic. A classical instance of this nature is J. J.\r\nRousseau’s adventure with the Venetian courtesan Giulietta, which he\r\ndescribes very vividly in his “Confession.” He went to see her full of\r\npassionate desire for sexual enjoyment, but Nature “had put into his\r\nhead a poison against this unspeakable happiness” for which his heart\r\nyearned. Hardly had he glanced at the beautiful girl than an idea came\r\nto him which moved him to tears, and completely diverted him from his\r\npurpose. He became more deeply absorbed in this idea, the sexual desires\r\ncompletely disappeared, and he was no longer in a position to prove his\r\nmanhood. To this tragi-comic episode we owe the exclamation of the\r\ndisappointed girl, which has passed into a proverb: “Lascia le donne e\r\nstudia la matematica” (“Leave women alone, and go and study\r\nmathematics”). In the =reflective love= of Kierkegaard, Grillparzer,\r\nAlfred de Musset, and other men of remarkable genius, there is also\r\nrecognizable an element of impotence.\r\n\r\nThe majority of all cases of impotence belong to the class of true\r\n=nervous, neurasthenic= impotence, and these are diffused especially\r\namong the circles who supply the greatest contingent to the ranks of\r\nneurasthenics in general--that is, among officers, merchants,\r\nphysicians, and other classes of the cultured part of our population\r\nwhose professional duties are arduous. Among the causes of neurasthenic\r\nimpotence, excessive masturbation and chronic gonorrhœa, with its\r\nconsequences, play the principal part. Neurasthenic impotence manifests\r\nitself, above all, by abnormal conditions of erection and ejaculation,\r\neither of which may by itself be diminished or completely prevented; or,\r\nagain, both may exhibit abnormalities, whilst in some cases even\r\nerection may be =very frequent=, =unusually powerful=, and\r\n=long-lasting= (the so-called “=priapism=”), whilst ejaculation and\r\nvoluptuous sensation are completely wanting, and these erections are in\r\nmost cases accompanied by very =painful= sensations. An extremely\r\ncharacteristic symptom of nervous impotence is a =premature discharge of\r\nthe semen=, not merely _ante portas_, but often even at the first signs\r\nof activity of the libido sexualis, at which time erection may be very\r\nwell developed. In other cases, again, erection occurs, but no\r\nejaculation of the semen. Finally, both may be completely wanting (the\r\nso-called “=paralytic impotence=”).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following cases, which came under my own observation, show some of\r\nthe above-mentioned types of impotence:\r\n\r\n  1. A man, twenty-nine years of age, married for ten months, complains,\r\n  after obviously excessively frequent enjoyment of his conjugal rights,\r\n  of a sense of weakness and weariness after intercourse, such as he has\r\n  never previously experienced, as well as of a continually earlier\r\n  ejaculation, latterly even on simple contact of his penis with the\r\n  vulva. Erection is always present and is powerful. On further inquiry\r\n  he admitted that in his four-weeks’ honeymoon he had connexion once\r\n  daily, and thenceforward two or three times a week.\r\n\r\n  2. A man, twenty-one years of age, states that a year and a half ago\r\n  for the first time he endeavoured to have sexual intercourse; he has\r\n  never yet succeeded in completing coitus. Since the age of fourteen\r\n  years he has suffered from frequent pollutions and from marked sexual\r\n  excitability. He has often tried to effect coitus, but there has\r\n  always resulted precipitate ejaculation, with his penis in a flaccid\r\n  condition. He has, properly speaking, only morning erections,\r\n  dependent upon a full bladder. It is possible that a marked varicocele\r\n  on the left side has something to do with the genesis of this\r\n  impotence.\r\n\r\n  3. A man, forty-eight years of age, has noticed for some years a\r\n  distinct decline in sexual potency. Ejaculation always occurs shortly\r\n  before _immissio membri_, when the penis is flaccid or only\r\n  semi-erect. If erection is complete, on the other hand, then\r\n  ejaculation fails to occur.\r\n\r\nVery peculiar, and offering a kind of analogy to vaginismus in women, is\r\nimpotence consequent upon =excessively painful sensibility of the glans\r\npenis=, as a result of sexual neurasthenia or of local inflammatory\r\nprocesses (balanitis, etc.). The pains during coitus in these cases are\r\noften so severe that those thus affected completely abandon any attempt\r\nat intercourse.\r\n\r\nThe question =whether impotence can result from sexual abstinence= is\r\nstill disputed. Fürbringer does not know of any certain cases. According\r\nto Virey,[450] by “complete and continuous abstinence from intercourse”\r\nin the male the organs by which the semen is prepared--the testicles,\r\nthe seminal vesicles, and the vasa deferentia--and also the penis,\r\nbecome smaller, “unsightly, wrinkled, and inactive.” Galen reports the\r\nsame of the athletes of the Roman Empire, men who had to live a life of\r\nstrict continence. Virey alludes to an “extremely chaste saint, in whom\r\nafter death no trace of genital organs could be discovered” (!). That\r\nabsolute abstinence must ultimately limit potency, if only by psychical\r\nmeans, is _a priori_ probable.\r\n\r\nRecent observations confirm the view that long-continued absolute sexual\r\nabstinence exercises a harmful influence upon potency, and especially\r\nupon potentia coeundi. As a proof of this, I may more especially mention\r\ntwo cases of University professors, not yet thirty years of age, both of\r\nwhom until a little while ago had had no experience of sexual\r\nintercourse, one having remained continent during two years of married\r\nlife! Quite recently both of them repeatedly attempted normal coitus,\r\nbut with complete failure _quoad erectionem_. Von Schrenck-Notzing[451]\r\nalso reported a case of this character not long ago, in which,\r\nnotwithstanding the strong desire for normal sexual intercourse, in the\r\ncase of a literary man thirty-five years of age, who prior to marriage\r\nhad lived a life of =complete abstinence=, and had never practised\r\nmasturbation, every attempt at coitus proved a failure.\r\n\r\nFinally, we have to consider the more or less physiological =presenile\r\nand senile impotence= which accompanies the commencement of old age, but\r\nnaturally occurs at very different times in different individuals, for\r\nsome men are already old at the age of forty years, and others are not\r\nyet old at the age of seventy years. Von Gyurkovechky dates the first\r\ndecline in the sexual powers from the fortieth year of life, and\r\nconsiders that normally these powers are completely extinguished at\r\nabout sixty-five years. But there are numerous exceptions. Complete\r\npotency in respect of libido, erection, and ejaculation has been\r\nobserved in men of seventy and eighty years; and isolated cases have\r\neven been recorded in which men of ninety and one hundred years have\r\nprocreated children.[452] In the sense of Metchnikoff and Hirth, who in\r\ntheir writings proclaim the prevention of senility as a hygienic ideal,\r\nthis physiological _potentia senilis_ is no Utopia, and a future\r\nscientific macrobiotic will defer the onset of old age by from ten to\r\ntwenty years.\r\n\r\n  “I do not ask,” says Georg Hirth, “that the man in advanced age should\r\n  play with his sexual powers; but that he should possess =the\r\n  consciousness of being able to use them=--that I do demand” (“Ways to\r\n  Love,” p. 462).\r\n\r\nThe treatment of impotence in the male in its various forms is indeed a\r\ndifficult matter in individual cases, more especially in view of the\r\ngreat number of existing methods of treatment; but treatment promises\r\ngood results when it is based upon an exact, critical, individual\r\nanalysis of the separate causes and symptoms. It is partly =local= and\r\npartly =general=. In the case of impotence resulting from excessive\r\nmasturbation, or in the case of the well-known “gonorrhœal” impotence,\r\ngood results will be obtained from =slight cauterization of the urethra=\r\nand =massage of the prostate=, =local carbonic-acid douches= or\r\ncarbonic-acid baths, =warm or cold sitz-baths, or electrical treatment=,\r\nwith which, however, great care must be exercised. In some cases\r\nimperfect erection will be benefited by the application of a 10 %\r\n=ethereal solution of camphor=, in the form of friction or a spray, to\r\nthe entire genital region. Mechanical apparatus have also been employed\r\nto favour erection, as, for example, the so-called “=schlitten=,”\r\nconsisting of a conducting instrument for an insufficiently erect penis,\r\nmade up of two thin, suitably shaped laminæ of metal, or the “=erector=”\r\nof Gassen, which works in a similar manner. Apparatus of this nature are\r\nuseful only to this extent, that they give the penis a certain purchase.\r\nWe cannot allow that they possess any other effect, any more than\r\nGassen’s other apparatus, the “compressor,” the “cumulator,” and the\r\n“ultimo” (Löwenfeld, Fürbringer). Any local changes that can be detected\r\nas having some connexion with the occurrence of impotence must receive\r\nattention. This is obvious; and no less obvious is the treatment of any\r\ngeneral disorders which may give rise to the impotence. As regards the\r\ngeneral treatment of impotence, =psychical= influence must first be\r\nconsidered. =In most cases= this must take the form of temporary\r\nwithdrawal of the thoughts from the sexual sphere in general, for which\r\nthe strict prohibition of sexual activity (masturbation, etc.) forms the\r\nfoundation; in addition, =will= and =self-confidence= must be\r\nstrengthened. In these matters an intelligent wife can do much to\r\nsupplement the work of the physician. Sometimes a mere =change= in the\r\nmode of life or in the relations between husband and wife, above all, a\r\nchange in the mode of performing sexual intercourse (a change in\r\nposture, greater responsiveness on the part of the wife, etc.), may have\r\na manifest curative influence. The treatment of the neurasthenia which\r\nmay have caused the impotence will also have a favourable effect.\r\nAlcohol and tobacco are best entirely forbidden. Innumerable =drugs=\r\nhave been recommended for the treatment of impotence. The belief in the\r\nbeneficial effect of cantharides is as much a superstition as the belief\r\nin the aphrodisiac action of celery, asparagus, caviare, and truffles.\r\nCertainly all these may cause excitement of the genital organs, but this\r\nis merely due to an increased flow of blood to these organs, which is of\r\na very fugitive nature, and when the effect is often repeated\r\n(especially when cantharides is used for this purpose), it may have\r\nserious consequences. The influence of these substances may be compared\r\nwith the purely stimulating effect of flagellation. More confidence may\r\nbe placed in =phosphorus=, =strychnine=, and, above all, in =yohimbin=,\r\na drug prepared from the bark of a West African tree,[453] which is\r\nwarmly recommended in cases of neurasthenic impotence by Mendel and\r\nEulenburg. Having myself seen good results from the use of Yohimbin\r\nRiedel in two cases of pre-senile gonorrhœal impotence, I can confirm\r\nthe favourable judgment of Eulenburg. In the case of pre-senile\r\nimpotence in a man nearly sixty years of age yohimbin was the only means\r\nwhich, after several years’ intermission, enabled him once more to have\r\nerections, and repeatedly to perform coitus. Eulenburg reports the case\r\nof a man, which is probably unique, in whom, =after a few days’ use=,\r\nyohimbin restored sexual potency after he had been impotent for twelve\r\nyears! This interesting drug is certainly a valuable enrichment of our\r\naphrodisiac armamentarium, and the first drug of this nature to which\r\nthe name of a specific against impotence can justly be given.\r\n\r\nQuite recently Eulenburg, Posner, Nevinny, and others, have warmly\r\nrecommended as a true specific in cases of functional impotence a\r\ncombination of lecithin with the active principle of the Brazilian plant\r\n_Muira Puama_. This new drug is by Eulenburg termed “muiracithin.”\r\n\r\nFrom the above-described individual troubles (masturbation, sexual\r\nhyperæsthesia, sexual anæsthesia, pollutions, and impotence) is composed\r\nthe clinical picture of =sexual neurasthenia=, which, however, is\r\nmanifested also by other symptoms, among which we must mention certain\r\n=perceptions of anxiety= and certain =coercive ideas=, such as the\r\ncondition, known also to the laity, of =agoraphobia=, which is very\r\nfrequently met with in sexual neurasthenia; also the fear of travelling\r\nalone by railway, or sudden anxiety in the theatre or concert-hall, in\r\nthe form of the fear of fire, with the accompanying irresistible impulse\r\nto rush out into the open; further, =lumbar pains= and =neuralgia of the\r\ngenital organs=, and =anomalies= and =pains connected with the\r\nevacuation of urine=; =an inclination to sexual perversions=; =gastric\r\naffections=,[454] such as nervous retching and vomiting, painful cramps\r\nof the stomach, loss of appetite, also excessive hunger, nervous\r\ndyspepsia, etc.; =migraine= and =heart troubles= of manifold kinds. It\r\nis not to be wondered at that when sexual neurasthenia is markedly\r\ndeveloped, and when several of the above-described manifestations occur,\r\nthe disease may pass on into a condition of complete =mental\r\nexhaustion=, associated with =morbid irritability= and =hypochondriacal=\r\nand =melancholy= ideas. We then ultimately see the development of\r\ntypical =sexual hypochondria=.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of sexual neurasthenia--which in the last-described\r\ngeneral symptom-complex occurs also in women, associated in their case\r\nwith =amenorrhœa=, =dysmenorrhœa=, or =menorrhagia=[455]--consists for\r\nthe most part in the already described treatment of the individual\r\nsymptoms. In addition, we have to make use of hyperalimentation,\r\n=hydro-therapeutic methods=, =gymnastic= treatment, general =massage=,\r\nand =climatic= cures.\r\n\r\n  [396] Havelock Ellis, “The Sexual Impulse and the Sense of Shame.”\r\n\r\n  [397] Fürbringer’s article, “Masturbation,” in Eulenburg’s\r\n  _Real-Enzykldopädie der gesamten Heilkunde_, vol. xvii., p. 523, third\r\n  edition (Vienna and Leipzig, 1898).\r\n\r\n  [398] Metchnikoff, “The Nature of Man,” pp. 95-99.\r\n\r\n  [399] A French erotic work describes how an impotent man, in the hope\r\n  of obtaining an erection, allowed a cockchafer to crawl about his\r\n  penis.\r\n\r\n  [400] Probably the following case of an onanist, sixty-four years of\r\n  age, is unique.

The truth probably lies midway between the views of\r\n  Effertz and those of Guttzeit.\r\n\r\n  [435] By vaginismus we understand involuntary convulsive contraction\r\n  of the vaginal muscles, associated with abnormal sensibility of the\r\n  vaginal inlet, dependent on masturbation, or induced by the\r\n  above-mentioned painful sensations and injuries which occur in\r\n  maladroit and brutal coitus (this is by far the commonest cause of\r\n  vaginismus), especially when the penis is very large and the vaginal\r\n  inlet very small, or when the female genital organs are further\r\n  forward than usual. Vaginismus generally arises from small injuries\r\n  and lacerations, produced in this manner; with the physical sense of\r\n  pain is associated also psychical anxiety with regard to renewed\r\n  attempts at intercourse; and in this way the reflex spasm is produced.\r\n  Sometimes the vaginal spasm does not begin until after the penis has\r\n  been introduced, so that this organ is retained (_penis captivus_). A\r\n  few years ago a remarkable case of this kind occurred in Bremen.\r\n  One of the dock labourers was having sexual intercourse in an\r\n  out-of-the-way corner of the docks, when the woman became affected\r\n  with this involuntary spasm, and the man was unable to free himself\r\n  from his imprisonment. A great crowd assembled, from the midst of\r\n  which the unfortunate couple were removed in a closed carriage, and\r\n  taken to the hospital, and not until chloroform had been administered\r\n  to the girl did the spasm pass off and free the man!\r\n\r\n  [436] A very clever study of the conditions here described will be\r\n  found in a recent English novel, “Mr. and Mrs. Villiers,” by Hubert\r\n  Wales (Heinemann, London, 1907).--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n  [437] Rozier describes two typical examples of feminine erotomania\r\n  (“The Secret Aberrations of the Female Sex,” pp. 123-128; Leipzig,\r\n  1831).\r\n\r\n  [438] POLLUTIONS.--This term has not perhaps as yet acquired a right\r\n  of residence in the English tongue, but I use it because it is needed.\r\n  There is no other word which can be employed as a general term (1) to\r\n  include all involuntary emissions of semen, whether nocturnal or\r\n  diurnal; and (2) to include involuntary sexual orgasm in the female as\r\n  well as in the male. In the female the term “seminal emission” is\r\n  inapplicable; but the term “pollution” can be applied in English (as\r\n  it is in German) to either sex. By American writers the term\r\n  “pollution” is now generally used (see, for instance, Allen,\r\n  “Disorders of the Male Sexual Organs,” _Twentieth Century Practice_,\r\n  vol. vii., p. 612 _et seq._).--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n  [439] L.

I started from the point of view that, in\r\norder to obtain new ideas regarding the nature of psychopathia sexualis,\r\nand in order to revise the old ideas in the light of recent knowledge,\r\nwe must keep before our eyes, not one-sidedly “=the sick man=,” but\r\ncomprehensively “=man as man=,” both as =civilized man= and as =savage\r\nman=.\r\n\r\nPreviously the doctrine of psychopathia sexualis had been dominated\r\nexclusively by =clinical, purely medical conceptions=. Observations had\r\nbeen limited to morbid phenomena, occurring in individuals with an\r\nabnormal _vita sexualis_. Thus there had arisen a general view of the\r\n=nature= of sexual anomalies, by which these anomalies were allotted\r\nalmost entirely to the province of the physician, and were described as\r\n=stigmata of degeneration=. H. J. Löwenstein,[456] Häussler,[457] and\r\nKaan,[458] in the third and fifth decades of the nineteenth century,\r\nwere the first to adopt this medical point of view of sexual\r\naberrations; and finally, in the last quarter of the same century,\r\nRichard von Krafft-Ebing[459] converted modern sexual pathology into a\r\ncomprehensive scientific system,[460] which stands and falls with the\r\nidea of =degeneration=.\r\n\r\nVon Krafft-Ebing is, and remains, the true founder of modern sexual\r\npathology. Without wishing in the slightest degree to underestimate the\r\nvalue of the clinical researches he carried out in this province of\r\nresearch, characterized by precision and profound scientific\r\nzeal--without undervaluing for a moment these extraordinary services--I\r\nam compelled to point out that his purely medical view of sexual\r\naberrations is one-sided, and to insist that it must be amplified and\r\nrectified by anthropological and ethnological researches.\r\n\r\nLet us leave the hospital and the medical consulting-room; let us make a\r\njourney round the world; let us observe the sexual activity of the\r\n_genus homo_ in its manifold phenomena, not as physicians, but as\r\nordinary observers; let us compare the sexuality of the civilized human\r\nbeing with that of the savage: then we shall recognize the vast\r\nextension of our visual field for the comprehension of psychopathia\r\nsexualis; we shall see how the civilized and temporary phenomenon\r\nbecomes absorbed into the general human phenomenon, presenting amid all\r\nlocal variations =the same fundamental lineaments=. Psychopathia\r\nsexualis exists =everywhere= and =at all times=. Culture, civilization,\r\nand diseases play only the parts of favouring, modifying, intensifying\r\nfactors.\r\n\r\nI do not go so far as Freud, who, on account of the now generally\r\nrecognized wide diffusion of perverse sexual tendencies, is compelled to\r\nadopt the view “that the rudiments of perversions are the =primeval=\r\ngeneral rudiments of the human sexual impulse, out of which the normal\r\nsexual mode of behaviour is developed in the course of evolution, in\r\nconsequence of organic changes and psychical inhibitions”;[461] but I do\r\nmaintain that sexual perversities and perversions appertain to the human\r\nrace as such, and independently of civilization. I am convinced that\r\nthey are =supplementary= to normal sexual manifestations, and that their\r\ndiffusion among civilized and savage peoples =extends far more widely\r\nthan the circle of true degenerative phenomena=.\r\n\r\nThe sexual impulse, as a purely physical function, is neither an object\r\nof comparison nor a distinctive characteristic between primitive and\r\ncivilized humanity. The “elementary ideas” of humanity return everywhere\r\nagain in the elementary manifestations of sexual aberrations.\r\n\r\nFrom the investigations collected and published in the above-mentioned\r\nwork I have been led to the firm conviction, which I must now put\r\nforward as a =scientific truth= based upon the teaching of anthropology,\r\nfolk-lore, and the history of civilization, that at the present day, in\r\nour time so widely decried as “nervous,” “degenerate,” and\r\n“overcivilized,” not only are there no more sexually “perverse” persons\r\nthan there were in former days--let us think only of the middle ages,\r\nwith their frightful excesses, appearing in epidemic diffusion--but,\r\nfurther, that the greater part of the perversions of the present day are\r\nnot to be regarded as “degenerations” at all; and, finally, that the\r\nfactors which are to weaken and undermine the vital forces of a nation\r\nmust be something other than purely sexual factors. For sexual\r\naberrations alone have, taken as a whole, but a trifling influence in\r\neffecting the decadence of a nation. They first gain such an influence\r\nin combination with causes, which we cannot now discuss, of an economic\r\nand political nature.\r\n\r\nAs old as humanity is the fable of the good old times, of the golden\r\nyouth of the human race, of the glorious past, to which an always\r\ncorrupt, physically and morally rotten =present= is supposed to have\r\nsucceeded.[462] The ancients held this view; it recurred at the time of\r\nthe renascence; and since the time of Rousseau’s unfortunate\r\ncondemnation of all civilization, it has been, in the hands of all\r\nzealots, moral fanatics, backsliders, and guardians of conventional\r\nmorality, a greatly prized weapon, and one, also, of great power when\r\nused to influence the ignorant and easily misled. Anthropology, the\r\nhistory of primitive man, and the history of civilization in general,\r\nhave utterly destroyed this beautiful dream of the good old times and of\r\nthe =better= days of the past. Nothing has been left but the ever =more\r\nbeautiful= present!\r\n\r\nThe critical and far-sighted Lessing opposed Rousseau’s hypothesis of\r\ncorruption by means of “civilization.” It was true, he said, that\r\nAthens, standing so high in civilization, and at the same time so\r\ncorrupt, passed away; but the =virtuous= Sparta, did not this also pass\r\naway? Rousseau himself had to admit that the destruction of civilization\r\nwould be of no use, that the world would then relapse into barbarism,\r\nand that the corruption would =none the less= persist. The philologist\r\nMuff,[463] discussing this question, added that if civilization had not\r\ncome, vice would still have been dominant, and that civilization,\r\ninvolving as it does =intellectual= progress, provides also the means\r\nfor counteracting vice.\r\n\r\nPhysicians and natural philosophers have long protested against the\r\ntheory of the corrupt and degenerate “present.” For instance, a\r\ncountryman of Rousseau’s, Dr. Delvincourt,[464] exclaimed:\r\n\r\n  “How false is the assumption of the fanatics and the pious who\r\n  attribute to the moral corruption of our century the majority of\r\n  diseases, and, above all, venereal diseases; who maintain that the\r\n  race is degenerating; and who thunder an anathema against modern young\r\n  men, whom they would gladly muzzle as we muzzle an animal.”\r\n\r\nMust we, then, he asks, at a moment when civilization is marching\r\nforward with giant strides, have our ears wearied with sophisms which\r\ncan no longer deceive even the ignorant masses? And he shows how =since\r\nprimeval times, everywhere=, all over the earth, vice has been diffused.\r\nHe rightly points to the innumerable _monuments de turpitude_ of all\r\nages.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time (be it noted, more than sixty years ago) in Germany\r\nthe celebrated natural philosopher Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg, in an\r\nacademic speech with the distinctive title “=The Fear that Progressive\r\nIntellectual Development will Lead to Physical National Degeneration: A\r\nDemonstration that this Fear is entirely devoid of Scientific and\r\nMedical Foundation=” (Berlin, 1842), opposed the belief in the\r\nunwholesome influence of civilization upon the popular strength and\r\npopular morals. Of special interest to us are his remarks upon the\r\nalleged deleterious influence of civilization upon sexuality. He says\r\n(p. 8):\r\n\r\n  “The occurrence of puberty in warm climates at a comparatively early\r\n  age (from ten to fifteen years), in cold climates somewhat later (from\r\n  fourteen to eighteen years), is a natural measure of human\r\n  intelligence and power; and if our sexually mature youths at school,\r\n  at the time at which their development has naturally progressed to\r\n  this point, experience also sexual stimulation, this is entirely\r\n  according to the nature of things, and only imposes upon those in\r\n  charge of schools, and upon parents, the special duty of watchfulness\r\n  in these respects. Even if secret vice becomes general anywhere among\r\n  young fellows in a manner open to regret, still, this does not mean\r\n  that our schools are the cause of physical weakness, of\r\n  overstimulation, and of deterioration of the people and of the epoch;\r\n  it merely indicates a local deficiency in energetic purposive\r\n  education, and a lack of the necessary watchfulness over the youths in\r\n  the particular institution in which the trouble has occurred, or that\r\n  the family life of the children thus affected is less strictly moral\r\n  than we could wish; and the evil is only to be overcome by\r\n  counteracting its especial causes. In many cases we may compare\r\n  outbreaks of premature sexuality with epidemics of disease, which also\r\n  find entrance through lack of sufficient care. Just the same is it in\r\n  respect of the great mass of adults who, by exhortation and example on\r\n  the part of those whose business it is to give them counsel, are in\r\n  most cases so easily led in the right direction, but who, in the\r\n  absence of such judicious treatment, often give way to the most\r\n  unbridled licentiousness. The student of popular history will easily\r\n  find numerous instances of cause and effect, now of the former and now\r\n  of the latter kind.”\r\n\r\nEhrenberg comes to the conclusion, most encouraging to ourselves and to\r\nour time, and one which may be unhesitatingly accepted, that the entire\r\nhistory of humanity, in so far as that history is open to us, leads us\r\nto believe, not that the progress of civilization[465] has given rise to\r\ninfirmity or to nervous overstimulation of the people, but, on the\r\ncontrary, that as the centuries pass, =our bodies are as powerfully\r\ndeveloped as formerly=, and that there is an ever-happier development of\r\nall the nobler human activities, such as can only result from an\r\nimprovement in our mental faculties.\r\n\r\nAt the fifty-ninth Congress of German Natural Philosophers and\r\nPhysicians, held at Berlin in the year 1886, the celebrated physicist\r\nWerner von Siemens, discussing the same problem in a formal speech,\r\nproved the nullity of the hypothesis of the evil influence of\r\ncivilization upon the physical and moral nature of humanity, and\r\nexpressed himself as fully convinced that\r\n\r\n  “our activity in research and discovery conducts humanity to higher\r\n  stages of civilization, ennobles humanity, and makes ideal aims more\r\n  easily accessible; that the coming scientific age will diminish\r\n  poverty and illness, will increase the enjoyment of life, and will\r\n  make humanity better, happier, and more contented with its lot.”\r\n\r\n“Has humanity degenerated?” asks a celebrated specialist,[466] who,\r\nowing to the nature of his speciality, has been able to obtain\r\nexhaustive information regarding what is often believed to be a symptom\r\nof degeneration--namely, falling out of the hair and baldness--and he\r\nanswers:\r\n\r\n  “=Certainly not!= In the process of civilization, which has lasted for\r\n  many thousands of years, our organization has not experienced any\r\n  serious convulsion of its fundamental nature. Superficially only have\r\n  the battles we have had to fight made any mark upon us.”\r\n\r\nTo a frightful extent in earlier times the great infective epidemic\r\ndiseases decimated civilized humanity, to an extent which is hardly\r\nrealized at the present day, and those of more powerful constitution\r\nwere undoubtedly carried off quite as much as those endowed with weaker\r\npowers of resistance. Bubonic plague, small-pox, leprosy, the sweating\r\nsickness, scarlatina, cholera, and syphilis (which at its commencement\r\nwas a far more severe disease than it is at the present day), have often\r\nannihilated the blossoms of youth; and yet mankind as a whole has not\r\nsuffered therefrom. Formerly there were much more violent and obstinate\r\nnervous troubles than our modern “nervousness,” which, to a large\r\nextent, represents merely a =phenomenon of adaptation=, not a disease in\r\nthe proper sense of the term. St. Vitus’s dance, the dancing mania, and\r\nsimilar psycho-nervous epidemics, disturbed medieval humanity, without,\r\nhowever, giving rise to any permanent injury, and without causing\r\nprogressive degeneration. And the most frightful sexual excesses can do\r\nno harm to the strength of the nation.\r\n\r\nWith regard to this point, the reputed connexion between sexual excesses\r\nand the political downfall of a nation, Carl Bleibtreu[467] rightly\r\nremarks:\r\n\r\n  “Ancient Rome produced its greatest men during a period of moral\r\n  degeneration. The finest blossoms of Hellenic civilization coincided\r\n  with a period of fundamental immorality. We might easily urge that\r\n  after Pericles, Phidias, Aristophanes, Euripides, Alcibiades, and\r\n  Socrates, the decay of the Greek race began, notwithstanding the fact\r\n  that much later in Greek history the vital force of the nation was\r\n  proved by the appearance of men of the first rank, such as Alexander,\r\n  Aristotle, and Demosthenes. But this rejoinder does not help us much,\r\n  for in the earliest days of Greek history, in the legal codes of Solon\r\n  and Lycurgus, we find the most notable and clear indications that\r\n  precisely in respect of sexual relationship, and more especially in\r\n  regard to marriage and the procreation of children, the morals of this\r\n  fresh and youthful race were disordered to the greatest possible\r\n  extent.\r\n\r\n  “Just the same do we find it at the time of the Italian renascence and\r\n  at the time of the Hohenstaufen dynasty--a complete confusion of\r\n  sexual relationships. The eighteenth century, also, notwithstanding\r\n  all the justified jeremiads of Rousseau regarding the widespread\r\n  unnaturalness of the time, and notwithstanding all the sorrows of the\r\n  young Werther, was distinguished by the production of an incredible\r\n  abundance of men of genius; and in contemporary France, the country\r\n  which was most severely affected by this moral decay, there flourished\r\n  the generation to which such men as Mirabeau and Napoleon\r\n  belonged--men whose unparalleled vitality influences us to this\r\n  moment.”\r\n\r\nFinally, I must refer to two leading authors of recent years, Eli\r\nMetchnikoff and Georg Hirth, whose writings exhibit a remarkable\r\nsimilarity in respect of general philosophical foundation. Both have\r\nenergetically opposed the unfounded fantasies of degeneration (there\r\nexists also a =justified= campaign against the continuously effective\r\ncauses of degeneration in the form of alcohol, syphilis, etc.), and both\r\nhave advocated a belief in life and in the life-force.\r\n\r\nIn his work “The Nature of Man” (English translation by Chalmers\r\nMitchell; Heinemann, 1903), Metchnikoff advances an “optimistic\r\nphilosophy,” in opposition to the pessimistic degenerative theory of our\r\ntime, of which latter P. J. Möbius may be regarded as the chief\r\nadvocate, and he proves how the imperfections and “disharmonies” of the\r\nhuman organism may give place to a further development and\r\nperfectibility of human nature, and this =precisely in connexion with\r\nculture and civilization. It is now that humanity first begins really to\r\nlive.=[468] Mankind has not degenerated in consequence of civilization,\r\nbut has, on the contrary, by means of civilization, first attained the\r\npossibility of establishing “physiological old age” and “physiological\r\ndeath.” Our device is not =backwards=, but =forwards=! The pessimists\r\ncry out: “Existence has no meaning! For what purpose do we live, and for\r\nwhat purpose do we die?” This dreadful “=for what purpose=” with which\r\nFriedrich von Hellwald concludes his history of civilization, disturbs\r\nday by day emotional minds. Metchnikoff proves that this problem is\r\nconnected with the existence of the disharmonies of human nature. But\r\nevolution continues to transform these disharmonies into harmonies\r\n(“orthobiosis”). Thus the aim of human existence lies in “the completion\r\nof the entire physiological cycle of life with a normal old age, so\r\nthat, with the cessation of the instinct to live, and with the\r\nappearance of the instinct for natural death, the cycle comes to an\r\nend.” This is, to a certain extent, the =scientific= formulation of the\r\n“superman” of Nietzsche, who based upon quite similar considerations his\r\nopposition to the hypothesis of degeneration, and who, out of the\r\ndisharmonies, imperfections, and pains of life, also created the\r\nconviction of a progressive evolution, and thus, like Metchnikoff,\r\nthoroughly =affirmed= life. Metchnikoff’s ideal human being of the\r\nfuture is realizable, but only by means of the principles of science and\r\nintelligent culture.\r\n\r\nSimilar views to those of Metchnikoff are advanced by Georg Hirth. He,\r\nabove all, has introduced into science the most felicitous conception\r\nof “=hereditary enfranchisement=.”[469] Thus to the pessimistic\r\ndegeneration theories and the psychical paralysis evoked by the idea of\r\n“hereditary taint” (we now hear the expression from every mouth), Hirth\r\nopposes a =word of power=, a word expressing “an energetic opposing\r\nstream of tendency.” Thus the incontestable fact finds simple\r\nexpression, that\r\n\r\n  “The requirements of all individuals through millions of generations\r\n  =constitute an inalienable, progressively influential common\r\n  possession of the whole of humanity=, an =impulsive force= based upon\r\n  natural law, which marches victoriously forward over the sins and\r\n  failures of individuals.... That is to say, that in our entire\r\n  organism, so long as it continues to =live=, in addition to the\r\n  disturbing influences which we have inherited or have acquired by our\r\n  own faults, there exists also a mass of =old= and =new= constructive\r\n  influences, which work towards the =restitution of the former\r\n  condition=.... =Enfranchisement= by means of primevally old, healthy,\r\n  and strong reproductive cells is stronger than the quite recent\r\n  =tainting= by means of weakly and diseased germs. If it were not so,\r\n  the entire human race would long since have passed away, for there can\r\n  hardly exist a single family tree at the foot of which there are not\r\n  somewhere worms gnawing.”\r\n\r\nI cannot here examine more closely the extremely interesting foundation\r\nof this view, which rightly places in the foreground the capacity for\r\n=self-regeneration=, for the removal of morbid vital stimuli, and their\r\nreplacement by new and healthy vital stimuli, and which notably limits\r\nthe extension of hereditary “tainting.” The conclusion which Hirth draws\r\nfrom this view is identical with that of Metchnikoff--namely, =that our\r\nlife remains capable of upward progress=, a view which Hirth everywhere\r\nhappily employs in his battle “with the forces of obscurity and\r\ndegeneration.”\r\n\r\nThe theory of degeneration finds a thorough scientific refutation also\r\nin the admirable work by Dr. William Hirsch, “Genius and Degeneration: a\r\nPsychological Study” (Berlin and Leipzig, 1904). At the end of the book\r\n(p. 340) the writer says:\r\n\r\n  “In view of the investigations I have made, we are necessarily led to\r\n  the conclusion that the authors mentioned have =by no means= adduced\r\n  proof of a general degeneration of the civilized nations. Humanity\r\n  need not be alarmed with regard to the alleged ‘black plague of\r\n  degeneration,’ and the world need be as little concerned by these\r\n  fables of the ‘twilight of the nations’ as by Herr Falb’s prophecies\r\n  of the approaching destruction of our planet.”\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that the wide diffusion of the deleterious means of\r\nsensual gratification (alcohol, tobacco, etc.), the increase in the\r\nnumber of large towns, and the rapid growth in their population, by\r\nmeans of which prostitution and the spread of venereal diseases are\r\nespecially favoured, constitute important etiological factors for the\r\ndegeneration of the race. Still, the wide diffusion of public hygiene,\r\nwhich is more and more brought under the notice of the individual,\r\naffords here an effective counterpoise. “Enfranchisement” in Hirth’s\r\nsense is here clearly manifested.\r\n\r\nAfter we have seen that the “degeneration” of our time, to the medical\r\nidea of which we shall return to speak more exactly in the next chapter,\r\nis not greater now than it was in earlier epochs, and that sexual\r\nanomalies have always existed, let us return to consider this point, to\r\nthe anthropological view of psychopathia sexualis.\r\n\r\nIn my “Etiology of Psychopathia Sexualis” I have collected the general\r\nhuman phenomena of the sexual impulse in primitive and civilized\r\nstates--that is, the everywhere recurring fundamental lineaments and\r\nphenomena of the _vita sexualis_ peculiar to the _genus homo_ as such.\r\n\r\nAs the principal result of this inquiry, the following propositions\r\nappear to me to be established:\r\n\r\n=Degeneration cannot be employed, as von Krafft-Ebing has employed it in\r\nhis “Psychopathia Sexualis,” as a heuristic principle in the\r\ninvestigation, recognition, and judgment of sexual aberrations and\r\nperversions.=\r\n\r\nAt the most, degeneration is no more than a =favouring= factor of the\r\ndiffusion of sexual abnormalities, an influence which =increases the\r\nfrequency= of their appearance.\r\n\r\n=On the contrary, the ultimate cause of all sexual perversions,\r\naberrations, abnormalities, and irrationalities, is the need for variety\r\nin sexual relationships peculiar to the genus homo, which is to be\r\nregarded as a physiological phenomenon, and the increase of which to the\r\ndegree of a sexual irritable hunger is competent to produce the most\r\nsevere sexual perversions.=\r\n\r\nIn contrast with this, “degeneration” or diseases play only a\r\nsubordinate part, and can be invoked for the explanation of only a small\r\nnumber of sexual aberrations--at most for those which come to the notice\r\nof physicians on account of pathological conditions or _in foro_. In\r\nfact, the =majority= of cases of sexual perversions which come the way\r\nof the physicians in clinical or forensic relationships =are=\r\npathological, but these constitute only a =minority of all cases=. The\r\nlarge majority of cases do =not= come within the scope of\r\ndegeneration.[470]\r\n\r\nFreud, in his “Three Essays on the Sexual Theory,” recognizes the\r\njustice of my view, and on p. 80 he writes:\r\n\r\n  “Physicians who have first studied perversions in well-marked examples\r\n  and peculiar conditions are naturally inclined to regard them as signs\r\n  of disease or as stigmata of degeneration, just as in the case of\r\n  sexual inversion. Daily experience has shown that the majority of\r\n  these transgressions--at any rate, the less marked of them--constitute\r\n  a seldom lacking constituent of the sexual life of healthy persons. In\r\n  favourable conditions =the normal individual may exhibit such a\r\n  perversion for a considerable length of time in the place of his\r\n  normal sexual activity; or the perversion may take its place beside\r\n  the normal sexual activity. Probably there is no healthy person in\r\n  whom there does not exist, at some time or other, some kind of\r\n  supplement to his normal sexual activity, to which we should be\r\n  justified in giving the name of ‘perversity.’=”[471]\r\n\r\nA =second= important factor in the genesis of sexual anomalies is the\r\n=ease with which the sexual impulse is affected by external influences,\r\nthe associative inclusion of manifold external stimuli in sexual\r\nperception itself=, the “=synæsthetic stimuli=,” as I myself have called\r\nthem, in the amatory life of mankind. In this way gradually all the\r\nrelations of art, religion, fashion, etc., to sexuality have developed,\r\nand they offer, in conjunction with the sensory impressions and the\r\npsychical and physical imaginative associations which accompany the\r\nsexual act, an incredibly rich material for the manifold realizations of\r\nthe sexual need for variation.\r\n\r\nThe need for variety in sexual relationships, in conjunction with the\r\nsexual “demand for stimulation” (Hoche),[472] plays a great part,\r\nespecially in the occurrence of sexual perversions in =adult= persons\r\nand at a more advanced age of life. The effect of =external influences=\r\nis most clearly noticeable in =childhood=, when it is experienced most\r\ndeeply and in a most enduring manner, and when it can become permanently\r\nassociated with sexual perception (Binet and von Schrenck-Notzing).\r\n\r\nAlexander von Humboldt, in his “Cosmos” (vol. ii., Introduction), drew\r\nattention to the well-known experience that “=sensual impressions and\r\napparently chance occurrences are, in the case of youthful emotional\r\nindividuals, often capable of determining the entire course of a human\r\nlife=.” Freud draws attention to the psychological fact that impressions\r\nof childhood, which have apparently been forgotten, may,\r\nnotwithstanding, have left the most profound marks upon our psychical\r\nlife, and may have determined our entire subsequent development. The\r\nimpressions of childhood are often incorporated fate. For this reason,\r\nfor example, the children of criminals become criminals themselves, not\r\nbecause they are “born” criminals, but because, as =children=, they grow\r\nup in the atmosphere of crime, and the impressions they here receive\r\nbecome firmly and deeply rooted in their natures. Hence the campaign\r\nagainst crime must in the first place take into consideration the\r\n=education of the children of criminals=!\r\n\r\nFrom the need for variety in sexual relationships, and from the effect\r\nof external influences, we deduce the possibility and the actual\r\nfrequency of the =acquirement= and the =artificial production= of sexual\r\nperversions and perversities; and these, in proportion to the\r\n=intensity= of the sexual impulse (=very variable= in strength in\r\ndifferent individuals, according to the ease with which it is excited),\r\nwill appear now earlier, now later, will be now transient and now\r\nenduring.\r\n\r\nThe =third= important etiological factor in the origination of sexual\r\nperversions is the =frequent repetition= of the =same= sexual\r\naberration. There can be no doubt whatever that the normal human being\r\ncan become =accustomed= to the most diverse sexual aberrations, so that\r\nthese become perversions, which appear in =healthy= human beings just as\r\nthey do in the diseased.\r\n\r\n=Fourthly=, =suggestion= and =imitation= play an extremely important\r\nrôle in the _vita sexualis_ alike of primitive and of civilized nations,\r\nin accordance with which certain aberrations in the sexual sphere become\r\ndiffused with great rapidity, and make their appearance as customs,\r\nfashions, and psychical epidemics. Those who everywhere trace\r\nperversities from morbid rudiments underestimate the powerful influence\r\nwhich =example= and =seduction= exercise in the human sexual life. This\r\nis especially noticeable to-day in those sexual perversions which have\r\nbecome =national customs=. The most celebrated example is that of\r\n=Hellenic pæderasty=, reputedly introduced from Crete, but probably in\r\nthe first place originated by a few =genuinely= homosexual individuals,\r\nwho in their own interest transmitted artificially by suggestion their\r\npeculiar tendencies to a few heterosexual individuals, until at last the\r\nlove of boys became a national custom which every heterosexual man\r\nadopted. The momentous part which modern =prostitution=, and more\r\nespecially =brothels=, plays in the suggestion of perversions has\r\nalready been mentioned. It is a matter to which we shall frequently have\r\noccasion to return. Schrank alludes (“Prostitution in Vienna,” vol. i.,\r\np. 285) to a prostitute who enjoyed a “European reputation” as an artist\r\nin sexual perversities of every kind, and who enjoyed the nickname of\r\n“the Ever-Virgin,” because she allowed men every possible kind of\r\nenjoyment except that of regular normal intercourse (which she avoided\r\nfor fear of becoming impregnated).\r\n\r\n=Fifthly=, the =difference= between man and woman in the essence, the\r\nkind, and the intensity, of sexual perception (sexual activity in man,\r\nsexual passivity in woman) constitutes a rich source of sexual\r\naberrations, most of which belong to the provinces of masochism and\r\nsadism.\r\n\r\n=Sixthly=, and lastly, in otherwise =healthy individuals there occur at\r\na very early age=, and probably in consequence of =congenital=\r\nconditions, changes in the direction and the aim of sexual perception,\r\nvariations from the type of differentiated heterosexual love. =Genuine\r\nhomosexuality= is the principal phenomenon to be considered under this\r\nhead. It occurs in perfectly =healthy= individuals quite independently\r\nof degeneration and of civilization; and it is diffused throughout the\r\nwhole world.\r\n\r\nFrom all these facts may be deduced the =untenability= of a purely\r\n=clinical and pathological= conception of sexual aberrations and\r\nperversions. We must now accept the point of view that, although\r\nnumerous morbid degenerate and psychopathic individuals exhibit sexual\r\nanomalies, yet these =identical= anomalies and aberrations are\r\nextraordinarily common in =healthy= persons.\r\n\r\nEthnological research, for more exact details of which I may refer\r\nto my own work already mentioned, and to the pioneer works of\r\nPloss-Bartels,[473] Mantegazza,[474] Friedrich S. Krauss,[475] and\r\nHavelock Ellis,[476] has adduced stringent proof that sexual\r\naberrations and perversions are =ubiquitous=, diffused throughout the\r\nentire world, just as much among primitive races as among civilized\r\nnations, that on the psycho-physical side they are “elementary ideas” in\r\nBastian’s sense, that they recur everywhere in a qualitatively identical\r\nmanner as a result of similar conditions. As it is with prostitution, so\r\nit is also with sexual perversions--a tendency to sexual aberration is\r\ndeeply rooted in human nature. It is a primitive, purely anthropological\r\nphenomenon, which is not strengthened by civilization, but, on the\r\ncontrary, is mitigated thereby. Charles Darwin rightly points out that\r\nthe =hatred= of sexual immorality and of sexual aberrations is a “modern\r\nvirtue,” appertaining exclusively to “civilized life,” and entirely\r\nforeign to the nature of primitive man. Primitive man revelled in wild\r\nindecency (as Wilhelm Roscher also proves), in sexual perversions, and\r\nlibertinism.[477] The sexual aberrations of civilized mankind are for\r\nthe most part =imitations= of the examples given by primitive peoples.\r\n\r\nThus, the well-known “stimulating rings” of European rubber\r\nmanufacturers (_cf._ Weissenberg, in the “Transactions of the\r\nAnthropological Society of Berlin,” 1893, p. 135) correspond to the\r\n“stimulating stones” of the Battaks (Staudinger, _op. cit._, 1891, p.\r\n351), to the “penis stones” of the savage Orang Sinnoi in Malacca\r\n(Vaughan Stevens in the _Zeitschrift für Ethnologie_, 1896, pp. 181,\r\n182), the “ampallang” of the Sunda Islands (see Miklucho-Maclay in the\r\n“Transactions of the Anthropological Society of Berlin,” 1876, pp.\r\n22-28). The “renifleurs” and “gamahucheurs” of the Parisian brothels and\r\nhouses of accommodation find their typical analogues in the urine\r\nfetichists and cunnilingi of the Island of Ponape, in the Carolines\r\n(_cf._ Ploss-Bartels), who are, in truth, far removed from the\r\n_fin-de-siècle_ life. And what a perverse imagination have the women of\r\nthis same island! According to Otto Finsch (_Zeitschrift für\r\nEthnologie_, 1880, p. 316), the men of this island have all only =one=\r\ntesticle, because in boys at the age of seven or eight years the left\r\ntesticle is removed by a piece of sharpened bamboo. This is said to make\r\nthe men more desirable =to the women=! Among the Masai, for similar\r\nreasons, circumcision is effected in such a manner that a portion of the\r\nprepuce is left behind to form a kind of firm button of skin. “This mode\r\nof circumcision is greatly prized by the women. Among the black races,\r\nindeed, everything turns round the question of sensual enjoyment”\r\n(“Medical Notes from Central Africa,” by M. C., published in the\r\n_Deutsche Medizinische Presse_, 1902, No. 14, p. 116). And how can our\r\nroués compete with the Tauni islanders of the South Seas? These select\r\ncertain women, who are not allowed to marry, but are reserved as simple\r\n“objects of sensual pleasure,” and with these every kind of sexual\r\nartifice is practised (Dempwolf, “Medical Notes on the Tauni Islanders,”\r\npublished in the _Zeitschrift für Ethnologie_, 1902, p. 335).\r\n\r\nThus between primitive and civilized races in these respects there are\r\nno important differences; and according to recent researches we find the\r\nsame may be said with regard to civilized nations, that there is no\r\ndifference between =town= and =country=.[478] I quote here the account\r\ngiven by an experienced author sixty years ago:\r\n\r\n  “People usually believe that in the country morals are much better\r\n  than in the towns, but this belief is quite erroneous. Brothels and\r\n  professional prostitutes naturally cannot exist in the country, but\r\n  nearly every peasant-girl in the country is equivalent to a secret\r\n  prostitute. It is incredible what sexual excesses go on between the\r\n  masculine and feminine inhabitants of the villages. Every barn, every\r\n  shed, every haystack, every copse, bears witness to this. Especially\r\n  disadvantageous to morals is it when in the heat of summer persons of\r\n  different sexes work side by side, half undressed, in remote fields\r\n  for the whole day, and lie down to rest side by side.”[479]\r\n\r\nWe may here allude to a fact that we shall have to discuss later--that\r\nyoung men, after the conclusion of their term of military service, carry\r\nback with them to the country the knowledge of sexual excesses and\r\nperversities which they have acquired in the town, and thus diffuse\r\nthese tendencies more and more widely.\r\n\r\nSince sexual anomalies constitute a phenomenon generally characteristic\r\nof humanity, =race= and =nationality=, as such, have less to do with the\r\nmatter than is commonly imagined. The Mongol and the Malay are not less\r\nvoluptuous than the Semites, or than many Aryan races. Among the\r\nSemites, the Arabs and the Turks are pre-eminently sexually perverse\r\nnations. They seek sexual gratification indifferently in the female\r\nharem and in the boys’ brothel (see numerous descriptions of travellers\r\non the moral customs of Turkey, the Levant, Cairo, Morocco, the Arabian\r\nSoudan, the Arabs in Africa, etc.). Among the Aryan races the Aryans of\r\nIndia must be considered pre-eminent as refined practitioners of\r\npsychopathia sexualis, which they have reduced to a =system=. In\r\naddition to recognizing forty-eight _figuræ Veneris_ (different postures\r\nin sexual intercourse), they practise every possible variety of sexual\r\nperversion; and they have in various textbooks[480] a systematic\r\nintroduction to sexual immorality. Here there is manifestly no trace of\r\nmorbid conditions, of degeneration, or of psychopathia; it is simply a\r\nmatter of popular manners and customs. Sexual perversion among the\r\nGreeks and the Romans, two other Aryan nations, is too well known to\r\nneed detailed description. In modern Europe the French were at one time\r\nbelieved to lead the way in sexual artifices. For a long time this has\r\nceased to be true, and, in fact, never was true. They do, indeed, excel,\r\nif one may use the expression, all other nations in the outward\r\ntechnique and in the elegance of their sexual excesses. To them from\r\nvery early times there has been ascribed a certain preference for the\r\nskatological element in the sexual life; but according to the recent\r\nresearches of Friedrich S. Krauss regarding the Slavs, published in his\r\n“Anthropophyteia,” this alleged pre-eminence is extremely doubtful. That\r\namong the Slavs sexual perversions of every kind have an extraordinarily\r\nwide diffusion has been shown by this investigator by the collection of\r\nan enormous mass of material. It is also very generally known that the\r\nEnglish from early days have exhibited a marked tendency to sadistic\r\npractices, and especially to flagellation. I will return later to this\r\nremarkable phenomenon. The French accuse the Germans of an especial\r\ntendency to homosexuality (_le vice Allemand_), but there are no\r\nsufficient grounds for this accusation. In psychopathia sexualis, the\r\nGermans are as cosmopolitan as they are in other respects.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the =age= of the individual in relation to sexual\r\nperversions, the frequency of these is greater after puberty than\r\nbefore,[481] and the frequency increases with advancing years. The time\r\nat which the imagination unfolds its greatest activity, the commencement\r\nof manhood, is extremely favourable to the origination of sexual\r\naberrations, and to their becoming habitual practices; and, again, the\r\nage at which the sexual powers begin to decline, and when for their\r\nincitation new stimuli are needed, is one at which abnormal varieties\r\nof sexual gratification frequently originate.[482]\r\n\r\nWhich =sex= is more inclined to abnormalities of the sexual impulse, the\r\nmale or the female?\r\n\r\nThe primitively more powerful sexual impulsive life of man in\r\nassociation with his greater use of alcohol makes him distinctly more\r\ninclined to follow sexual bypaths than woman, whose sexuality at first\r\ndevelops very gradually, and experiences, in consequence of motherhood,\r\npowerful inhibitions to the development of any sexual anomalies. On the\r\nother hand, the much =more difficult development= of voluptuous\r\nsensations in women, by means of normal coitus, is not rarely the cause\r\nof a tendency to perverse varieties of sexual intercourse. They often\r\nseduce man in this direction, and excel him in the discovery of sexual\r\nartifices. Among primitive races, where the relationships are clearest,\r\nthis is still easily recognizable, whereas by civilization the matter is\r\noften obscured. All the artificial deformities of the male genital\r\norgans amongst savages, which give the man much more trouble than\r\npleasure, but which, on the other hand, increase the voluptuous\r\nenjoyment of the woman during the sexual act, cannot otherwise be\r\nexplained except on the ground of an original demand on the part of\r\nwomen. To this category belong incisions in the glans penis, and the\r\nimplanting of small stones in the wounds until the skin has a warty\r\nappearance (Java); perforation of the penis to enable rods beset with\r\nbristles, feathers, rods with balls (the well-known “ampallang” of the\r\nDyaks of Borneo), bodkins, rings, bell-shaped apparatus, to be inserted\r\nthrough these perforations; the wrapping up of the penis in strips of\r\nfur with the hair outwards, or enveloping it in a leaden cylinder, etc.\r\nThe feminine imagination has proved inexhaustible in this direction.\r\nMiklucho-Maclay, the great authority on the sexual psychology of the\r\nsavage races of the Malay Archipelago and the South Sea Islands,\r\ndeclares it to be extremely probable =that all these customs and all\r\nthese apparatus were invented by or for women=. The women reject all men\r\nwho do not possess these stimulating apparatus on the penis. Finsch and\r\nKubary confirm this, and state that in most cases it is the frigidity of\r\nthe women which makes them desire such means of artificial stimulation.\r\nAmong civilized races, also, abundant material can be collected with\r\nregard to sexual perversities among women, as has recently been done by\r\nPaul de Régla in “Les Perversités de la Femme” (Paris, 1904), and by\r\nRené Schwaeblé in “Les Détraquées de Paris” (Paris, 1904).\r\n\r\nThe following case shows that European women sometimes demand artificial\r\nchanges in the male genital organs, in order to increase their\r\nvoluptuous sensations. Some years ago a man, fifty years of age, was\r\nadmitted into the syphilis wards of the Laibacher Hospital. The\r\ndischarge from the penis was, however, found to be due merely to\r\nbalanitis. On examination the greatly enlarged penis was found to be\r\nperforated by rod-shaped objects, and an incision through the skin\r\nshowed that these were pins and hairpins. The pins were about two inches\r\nlong, with brass heads the size of a peppercorn, and they were at least\r\nten in number. One of the pins was run partly into the testicle. After\r\nthe foreign objects had been removed, the man informed us that his\r\nmistress had stuck these in, in order that she might experience more\r\nardent sensations. The pins were all subcutaneous; several of them ran\r\nright round the penis.\r\n\r\n=Social differences= in respect of the frequency of sexual perversions\r\ndo not exist. Sexual perversions are just as widely diffused among the\r\nlower classes as among the upper. A. Ferguson, Havelock Ellis,\r\nTarnowsky, and J. A. Symonds are all in agreement regarding this fact,\r\nwhich, indeed, in view of the anthropological conception of psychopathia\r\nsexualis, does not require additional explanation.\r\n\r\nFinally, we come to the last and most important point--to the question\r\nof the relation of =culture= and =civilization= to psychopathia\r\nsexualis. Even though psychopathia sexualis is in its =essence=\r\nindependent of culture, is a general human phenomenon, still we cannot\r\nfail to recognize that civilization has exercised a certain influence\r\nupon the external mode of manifestation, and also upon the inner\r\npsychical configuration of sexual aberrations. Especially as regards the\r\nlatter--the psychical relationships--the perversity of the civilized man\r\nis more complicated than that of primitive man, although in =essence=\r\nthe two are identical.\r\n\r\nThe modern civilized man is in respect of his sexuality a peculiar =dual\r\nbeing=. The sexuality within him leads a kind of independent existence,\r\nnotwithstanding its intimate relationship to the whole of the rest of\r\nhis spiritual life. There are moments in which, even in men of lofty\r\nspiritual nature, pure sexuality becomes separated from love, and\r\nmanifests itself in its utterly elementary nature beyond good and evil.\r\nI expressed earlier the idea that this frequent phenomenon reminded me\r\nof the “monomania” of the older alienists. “Il y a en nous deux êtres,\r\nl’être moral et la bête: l’être moral sait ce que mérite l’amour\r\nvéritable, la bête aspire à la fange où on la pousse,” we find in a\r\nFrench erotic work (“Impressions d’une Fille” par Léna de Mauregard,\r\nvol. i., pp. 57, 68; Paris, 1900).\r\n\r\nNo other human impulsive manifestation is so ill adapted as sexuality to\r\nthe =coercion= and =conventionality= which civilization necessarily\r\nentails. Carl Hauptmann, in an interesting socio-psychological study,\r\n“Unsere Wirklichkeit” (“Our Reality”; Munich, 1902), has described very\r\nimpressively this frightful conventionality, especially characteristic\r\nof our own time, which so painfully represses the “reality” of love,\r\nsuppresses everything primitive in it, banishes it into the darkness of\r\nits own interior, and only allows the conventionally sanctioned forms of\r\nsexual love to subsist. This coercion, this outward pressure, develops a\r\nvolcano of elementary sexuality, which usually slumbers, but may\r\nsuddenly break out in eruption, and give free vent to excesses of the\r\nwildest nature. Dingelstedt in his poem “Ein Roman,” has excellently\r\ndescribed this condition:\r\n\r\n   “Wenn du die =Leidenschaft= willst kennen lernen,\r\n    Musst du dich nur nicht aus der Welt entfernen.\r\n    Such’ sie nicht auf in friedlicher Idylle,\r\n    In strohgedeckter und begnügter Stille...\r\n    Da suche sie in festlich vollem Saale\r\n    Bei Spiel und Tanz, an feierlichem Mahle,\r\n    Dort, eingeschnürt =in Form und Zwang und Sitte=,\r\n    Thront sie wie Banquos Geist in ihrer Mitte.”\r\n\r\n  [“If you wish to learn to know passion,\r\n    You must, above all, not remove yourself from the world.\r\n    Do not look for it in a peaceful idyll,\r\n    In padded and satisfied quietude....\r\n    Look for it in the full festal hall,\r\n    At the game and the dance, at the brilliant banquet;\r\n    There, entrapped amid form, and coercion, and custom,\r\n    Enthroned, like Banquo’s ghost, it sits amid the throng.”]\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Charles Albert[483] remarks:\r\n\r\n  “If love nowadays so often manifests itself in the form of aberration\r\n  or passion, this is almost always to be explained by the hindrances of\r\n  every kind which have been opposed to it. No other feeling is so\r\n  hindered, opposed, detested, and loaded with material and moral\r\n  fetters. We know how education makes a beginning in this way,\r\n  declaring that love is something forbidden, and how the hardness of\r\n  economic life continues the process. Hardly has a young man or a young\r\n  girl gone out into life, hardly have they begun to feel their way\r\n  into society, but they encounter a thousand difficulties which are\r\n  opposed to their living out their life from a sexual point of view.\r\n  How would it be possible that, in the limits of such a society, love\r\n  could become anything else but a fixed idea of the individual, and how\r\n  could it fail to give rise to continuous restlessness? Nature does not\r\n  allow herself to be inhibited by our artificial social arrangements.\r\n  The need for love within us remains active; it cries out in\r\n  unsatisfied desire; and when no answer is forthcoming, beyond the echo\r\n  of its own pain, it takes a perverse form. The love which is prevented\r\n  from obtaining complete satisfaction and repose is to many an\r\n  intensely painful torment.... The over-rich imagination and the\r\n  unsatisfied longing give rise to the most horrible and abnormal forms\r\n  of love. Above all, in a society which will make no room for love, the\r\n  love-passion must give rise to the greatest devastation. The impulse\r\n  to love which is repressed by the organization of society does not\r\n  only fight violently for air--the inevitable consequence of any\r\n  pressure--but it discovers also all those artifices and corruptions\r\n  which are supposed to make the enjoyment of love more intense.\r\n  Conscious of being despised by society, it endeavours to regain by\r\n  violence what is wanting to it in sensuality.”\r\n\r\nThe struggle for reality in love, for the elementary and the primitive,\r\nmanifests itself in the search for the greatest possible =contrast= to\r\nthe conventional, to the commonly sanctioned mode of sexual activity.\r\nLove cries out for “nature,” and comes thereby to the “unnatural,” to\r\nthe =coarsest, commonest= dissipation. This connexion has been already\r\nexplained (pp. 322-325). Certain temporary phenomena exhibit also this\r\nfact--for example, the remarkable preference for the most brutal, the\r\ncoarsest, the commonest dances, mere limb dislocations, such as the\r\ncancan, the croquette (machicha), the cake-walk, and other wild negro\r\ndances, which rejoice the modern public more than the most beautiful and\r\ngracious spiritual ballet. It was only when the above-described\r\nconnexion became clear to me that I was able to understand the\r\nremarkable alluring power of these dances, which had hitherto been\r\nincomprehensible to me.\r\n\r\nAn additional factor which favours the origination of sexual perversions\r\nis the =unrest= always connected with the advance of civilization, the\r\nhaste and hurry, the more severe struggle for existence, the rapid and\r\nfrequent change of new impressions. Fifty years ago the celebrated\r\nalienist Guislain exclaimed:\r\n\r\n  “What is it with which our thoughts are filled? Plans, novelties,\r\n  reforms. What is it that we Europeans are striving for? Movement,\r\n  excitement. What do we obtain? Stimulation, illusion, deception.”[484]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no longer any time for quiet, enduring love, for an inward\r\nprofundity of feeling, for the culture of the =heart=. The struggle for\r\nlife and the intellectual contest of our time leaves the possibility\r\nonly for transient sensations; the shorter they are, the more =violent=,\r\nthe more intense must they be, in order to replace the failing _grande\r\npassion_ of former times. Love becomes a mere =sensation=, which in a\r\nbrief moment must contain within itself an entire world. Modern youth\r\neagerly desires such =experience= of a whole world by means of love. The\r\neverlasting feeling of our classic period had been transformed, more\r\nespecially among our leading spirits, into a passionate yearning to\r\nreflect within themselves truly the spirit of the time, to live through\r\nin themselves all the unrest, all the joy, all the sorrow, of modern\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nFrom this there results a peculiar, more spiritual configuration of\r\nmodern perversity, a distinctive spiritualization of psychopathia\r\nsexualis, a true wandering journey, an “Odyssey” of the spirit,\r\nthroughout the wide province of sexual excesses. Without doubt the\r\nFrench have gone furthest in this direction, and the names of\r\nBaudelaire, Barbey d’Aurevilly, Verlaine, Hannon, Haraucourt, Jean\r\nLarocque, and Guy de Maupassant, indicate nearly as many peculiar\r\nspiritual refinements and enrichments of the purely sensual life.\r\n\r\nWe have no longer to deal with the pure love of reflection, as in the\r\ncase of Kierkegaard and Grillparzer, and in the writings of young\r\nGermany, where, indeed, reflection predominates, but which still more\r\nextends to the direction of =higher love=. Contrasted with this is the\r\n=simple lust of the senses=, by means of which new psychical influences\r\nare to be obtained. Voluptuousness becomes a cerebral phenomenon,\r\nethereal. In this way the most remarkable, unheard-of, sensory\r\nassociations appear in the province of sexuality--true _fin-de-siècle_\r\nproducts which are, above all, specifically =modern=, and could not\r\npossibly exist in former times. For it is always the same play of\r\nemotion, the same effects, the same terminal results: ordinary\r\nvoluptuousness. The dream of Hermann Bahr, of “non-sexual\r\nvoluptuousness,” and the replacement of the animal impulse by means of\r\nfiner organs, is only a dream. The elemental sexual impulse resists\r\nevery attempt at dismemberment and sublimation. It returns always\r\nunaltered, always the same. It is vain to expect new manifestations of\r\nthis impulse. Such efforts end either in bodily and mental impotence, or\r\nelse in sexual perversities. In these relationships the imagination of\r\ncivilized man is unable to create novelties in the =essence=; it can do\r\nso only as regards the objective =manifestations=. This is confirmed by\r\nthe increase of purely ideal sexual perversities in connexion with\r\ncertain spiritual tendencies of our time. Martial d’Estoc, in his book,\r\n“Paris Eros” (Paris, 1903), has given a clear description of these\r\npeculiar spiritual modifications of sexual aberrations. (It is\r\ninteresting to note that Schopenhauer remarks, in his “Neue\r\nParalipomena,” pp. 234 and 235: “The caprices arising from the sexual\r\nimpulse resemble a will-o’-the-wisp. They deceive us most effectively;\r\nbut if we follow them, they lead us into the marsh and disappear.”)\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nSEXUAL PERVERSIONS DUE TO DISEASE\r\n\r\nIt is the immortal service of Casper and von Krafft-Ebing to have\r\ninsisted energetically upon the fact that =numerous= individuals whose\r\n_vita sexualis_ is abnormal are persons suffering from =disease=. This\r\nis their _monumentum ære perennius_ in the history of medicine and of\r\ncivilization. Purely medical, anatomical, physical, and psychiatric\r\ninvestigations show beyond question that there are many persons whose\r\nabnormal sexual life is pathologically based.\r\n\r\nI shall not here discuss the peculiar =borderland state between health\r\nand disease=, the existence of which can be established in many sexually\r\nperverse individuals; I shall not refer to the “abnormalities,” the\r\n“psychopathic deficiencies,” the “unbalanced,” etc.; nor shall I discuss\r\nthe question of the significance of the stigmata of degeneration,\r\nbecause these will be adequately dealt with in connexion with the\r\nforensic consideration of punishable sexual perversions.\r\n\r\nHere we shall speak only of actual and easily determined diseases which\r\npossess a causal importance in the origination and activity of sexual\r\nperversions. The great majority of these are, naturally, =mental\r\ndisorders=.\r\n\r\nVon Krafft-Ebing, to whom we owe the most important observations\r\nregarding the pathological etiology of sexual perversions, enumerates\r\nthe following conditions: Psychical developmental inhibitions (idiocy\r\nand imbecility), acquired weak-mindedness (after mental disorders,\r\napoplexy, injuries to the head, syphilis, in consequence of general\r\nparalysis), epilepsy, periodical insanity, mania, melancholia, hysteria,\r\nparanoia.\r\n\r\nAmong these, =epilepsy= possesses the greatest importance.[485] It comes\r\ninto play =much more frequently= as a causal morbid influence in the\r\ncase of sexually perverse actions and offences than has hitherto been\r\nbelieved. The psychiatrist Arndt maintains that wherever an abnormal\r\nsexual life exists, we must always consider the possibility of epileptic\r\ninfluence. Lombroso assumes that all premature and peculiar instances of\r\nsatyriasis are instances of larval epilepsy. He gives several examples\r\nin support of this view, and also a case of Macdonald’s which\r\nillustrates the connexion between epilepsy and sexual perversity.[486]\r\nEspecially in the so-called epileptic “confusional states” do we meet\r\nwith sexually perverse actions; exhibitionism and other manifestations\r\nof sexual activity _coram publico_ are frequently referable to epileptic\r\ndisease. Similar impulsive sexual activities and similar confusional\r\nstates are seen after =injuries to the head= and in =alcoholic\r\nintoxication=, also after =severe exhaustion=. Many cases of “=periodic\r\npsychopathia sexualis=” are due to epilepsy.\r\n\r\n=Senile dementia= and =paralytic dementia= (general paralysis of the\r\ninsane), also severe forms of =neurasthenia= and =hysteria=, often\r\nchange the sexual life in a morbid direction, and favour the origin of\r\nsexual perversions.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact of great interest that Tarnowsky and Freud attribute to\r\n=syphilis= an important rôle in the pathogenesis of sexual anomalies. In\r\n50 % of his sexual pathological cases Freud found that the abnormal\r\nsexual constitution was to be regarded as the last manifestation of a\r\nsyphilitic inheritance (Freud, _op. cit._, p. 74). Tarnowsky observed\r\nthat congenital syphilitics, and also persons whose parents had been\r\nsyphilitic, but who themselves had never exhibited any definite symptoms\r\nof the disease, were apt later to show manifestations of a perverse\r\nsexual sensibility (Tarnowsky, _op. cit._, pp. 34 and 35). =Obviously\r\nthis is to be explained by the deleterious influence upon the nervous\r\nsystem (perhaps by means of toxins?) which syphilis is also supposed to\r\nexert in the causation of tabes dorsalis and general paralysis of the\r\ninsane.= When investigating the clinical history of cases of sexual\r\nperversion, it appears that previous syphilis is a fact to which some\r\nimportance should be attached.[487]\r\n\r\nFrom syphilis we pass to consider direct =physical= abnormalities and\r\n=morbid changes in the genital organs= as causes of sexual anomalies. In\r\nwomen prolapsus uteri sometimes leads to perverse gratification of the\r\nsexual impulse--for example, by pædication;[488] in men, shortness of\r\nthe frænum preputii plays a similar part,[489] also phimosis. Wollenmann\r\nreports the case of a young man suffering from phimosis, who, at the\r\nfirst attempt at coitus, experienced severe pain, and since that time\r\nhad an antipathy to normal sexual intercourse. He passed under the\r\ninfluence of a seducer to the practice of mutual masturbation. Only\r\nafter operative treatment of the phimosis did his inclination towards\r\nthe male sex pass away, and the sexual perversion then completely\r\ndisappeared.[490]\r\n\r\n  [456] Hermann Joseph Löwenstein, “De Mentis Aberrationibus ex Partium\r\n  Sexualium Conditione Abnormi Oriundis” (Bonn, 1823).\r\n\r\n  [457] Joseph Häussler, “The Relations of the Sexual System to the\r\n  Psyche” (Würzburg, 1826).\r\n\r\n  [458] Heinrich Kaan, “Psychopathia Sexualis” (Leipzig, 1844).\r\n\r\n  [459] R. von Krafft-Ebing, “Psychopathia Sexualis” (Stuttgart, 1882).\r\n\r\n  [460] We must not omit to mention the fact that a little earlier the\r\n  French physician Moreau de Tours published a comprehensive work upon\r\n  psychopathia sexualis, entitled “Des Aberrations du Sens Génésique”\r\n  (Paris, 1880).\r\n\r\n  [461] S.

This would be a gross injustice, because,\r\nin the first place, this movement has =in no way= proceeded from the\r\nhomosexual, but rather from heterosexual individuals, such as\r\nSchopenhauer, Strindberg, etc.; and because, in the second place, the\r\nhomosexual as such are not misogynists at all, and it is only a minority\r\nof them who shout in chorus to the misogynist tirades of Strindberg and\r\nWeininger.\r\n\r\nThe misogynists form to-day a kind of “=fourth sex=,”[491] to belong to\r\nwhich appears to be the fashion, or rather has =once more= become the\r\nfashion, for misogyny is an old story. There have always been times in\r\nwhich men have cried out: “Woman, what have I to do with you? I belong\r\nto the century”;[492] times in which woman was renounced as a soulless\r\nbeing, and the world of men became intoxicated with itself, and was\r\nproud of its “splendid isolation.”\r\n\r\nOf less importance is it that the Chinese since ancient times have\r\ndenied to woman a soul, and therewith a justification for\r\nexistence,[493] than that among the most highly developed civilized\r\nraces of antiquity such men as Hesiod, Simonides,[494] and, above all,\r\nEuripides, were all fierce misogynists. In the “Ion,” the “Hippolytus,”\r\nthe “Hecuba,” and the “Cyclops” we find the most incisive attacks on\r\nthe female sex. The most celebrated passage is that in the “Hippolytus”\r\n(verses 602-637, 650-655):\r\n\r\n  “Wherefore, O Jove, beneath the solar beams\r\n   That evil, woman, didst thou cause to dwell?\r\n   For if it was thy will the human race\r\n   Should multiply, this ought not by such means\r\n   To be effected; better in thy fane\r\n   Each votary, on presenting brass or steel,\r\n   Or massive ingots of resplendent gold,\r\n   Proportioned to his offering, might from thee\r\n   Obtain a race of sons, and under roofs\r\n   Which genuine freedom visits, unannoyed\r\n   By women, live.”[495]\r\n\r\nIn this passage we have the entire quintessence of modern misogyny. But\r\nEuripides betrays to us also the real motive of misogyny. In a fragment\r\nof his we read “the =most invincible= of all things is a woman”! _Hinc\r\nillæ lacrimæ!_ It is only the men who are not a =match= for woman, who\r\ndo not allow woman as a free personality to influence them, =who are so\r\nlittle sure of themselves= that they are afraid of suffering at the\r\nhands of woman damage, limitation, or even annihilation of their own\r\nindividuality. These only are the true misogynists.\r\n\r\nIt is indisputable that this Hellenic misogyny was closely connected\r\nwith the love of boys as a popular custom. To this we shall return when\r\nwe come to describe Greek pæderasty.\r\n\r\nAmong the Romans woman occupied a far higher position than among the\r\nGreeks--a fact which the institution of the vestal virgins alone\r\nsuffices to prove. Among the Germans, also, woman was regarded as worthy\r\nof all honour.\r\n\r\nThe =true source= of modern misogyny is Christianity--the Christian\r\ndoctrine of the fundamentally sinful, evil, devilish nature of woman. A\r\nStrindberg, a Weininger, even a Benedikt Friedländer, notwithstanding\r\nhis hatred of priests--all are the last offshoots of a movement against\r\nthe being and the value of woman--a movement which has persisted\r\nthroughout the Christian period of the history of the world.\r\n\r\n  “If I were asked,” says Finck,[496] “to name the most influential,\r\n  refining element of modern civilization, I should answer: ‘Woman,\r\n  beauty, love, and marriage’! If I were asked, however, to name the\r\n  most inward and peculiar essence of the early middle ages, my answer\r\n  would be: ‘Deadly hostility to everything feminine, to beauty, to\r\n  love, and to marriage.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of medieval misogyny was described by J. Michelet in his\r\nbook “The Witch.” Since woman and the contact with woman were regarded\r\nas radically evil, it followed that in theory and practice asceticism\r\nwas the ideal; celibacy was only the natural consequence of this hatred\r\nof woman; so also were the later witch trials the natural consequence.\r\nTherefore to this medieval misogyny, in contrast with modern misogyny,\r\nwhich represents only a weak imitation, we cannot deny a certain\r\njustification. The misogyny of the middle ages was earnestly meant; but\r\nit has become to-day mere phrase-making, dilettante imitation, and\r\nostentation. In contrast with the utterances of the modern misogynist,\r\nthe coarse abuse of women by such a writer as Abraham a Santa Clara has\r\na refreshing and amusing character.[497]\r\n\r\nModern misogyny is certainly an inheritance of Christian doctrine, and a\r\ntradition handed down from much earlier times, but still it has its own\r\ncharacteristic peculiarities. Misogyny is, however, now much more an\r\naffair of =satiety= or =disillusion= than of =belief= or =conviction=;\r\nwhereas in the days of medieval Christianity belief and conviction were\r\nthe effective causal factors of misogyny. In addition, among our\r\nneo-misogynists we have the factor of the =spiritual pride= of a man\r\nwho, from the standpoint of academic theoretical culture (which to men\r\nof this kind appears the highest summit of existence), looks down upon\r\nwomen, whom he regards as mentally insignificant, while he sympathizes\r\nwith her “physiological weak-mindedness.” He smiles on her with pity,\r\nand completely overlooks the profound life of emotion and feeling\r\ncharacteristic of every true woman, which forms a counterpoise to any\r\namount of purely theoretical knowledge--quite apart from the fact that\r\nwomen of intellectual cultivation are by no means rare.\r\n\r\nIf, in fact, we regard the =lives= of those who have reduced modern\r\nmisogyny to a system, we shall be able to detect the above-mentioned\r\ncauses in their personal experiences and impressions. The first\r\nimportant modern advocate of misogyny, the Marquis de Sade, lived an\r\nextremely unhappy married life, was deceived also in a love\r\nrelationship, and nourished his hatred of women by a dissolute life and\r\na consequent state of satiety.\r\n\r\nAnd as regards Schopenhauer, who does not recall his unhappy relations\r\nwith his mother? For he who has really loved his =mother=, he who has\r\nexperienced the unutterable tenderness and self-sacrifice of maternal\r\nlove, can never become a genuine, thoroughgoing woman-hater. But the\r\nmutual relationship of Schopenhauer and his mother was rather =hatred=\r\nthan love. Beyond question, also, his infection with syphilis, to which\r\nI was the first to draw attention, played a part in his subsequent\r\nhatred of women.\r\n\r\nStrindberg, in his “Confessions of a Fool,” has himself offered us the\r\nproof of the causal connexion between his misogyny and his personal\r\nexperiences and disillusions; and in Weininger’s book we can read only\r\ntoo clearly that he had had no good fortune with women, or had had\r\ndisagreeable experiences in his relations with them.\r\n\r\nDe Sade, who, perhaps, was not unknown to Schopenhauer,[498] was the\r\nfirst advocate of consistent misogyny on principle. It is an interesting\r\nfact, to which I have alluded in an earlier work (“Recent Researches\r\nregarding the Marquis de Sade,” p. 433), that de Sade’s and\r\nSchopenhauer’s opinions on the physical characteristics of women are to\r\nsome extent =verbally= identical. While Schopenhauer, in his essay “On\r\nWomen” (“Works,” ed. Grisebach, vol. v., p. 654), speaks of the\r\n“stunted, narrow-shouldered, wide-hipped and =short-legged= sex,” which\r\nonly a masculine intellect when =clouded by sexual desire= could\r\npossibly call “beautiful,” we find in the “Juliette” (vol. iii., pp.\r\n187, 188) of the Marquis de Sade the following very similar remarks on\r\nthe feminine body: “Take the clothes off one of these idols of yours! Is\r\nit these two =short= and crooked legs which have =turned your head= like\r\nthis?” This physical hatefulness of women corresponds to the mental\r\nhatefulness of which de Sade gives a similar repellent picture\r\n(“Juliette,” vol iii., pp. 188, 189). In all his works we find the same\r\nfanatical hatred of women. Sarmiento, in “Aline et Valcour” (vol. ii.,\r\np. 115), would like to annihilate all women, and calls that man happy\r\nwho has learned to renounce completely intercourse with this “debased,\r\nfalse, and noxious sex.”\r\n\r\nQuite in the spirit of de Sade, to whom the misogynists of the Second\r\nEmpire referred as an authority, Schopenhauer, in the previously quoted\r\nessay “On Women,” Strindberg, in the “Confessions of a Fool,” and\r\nWeininger, in “Sex and Character,” preached contempt for the feminine\r\nnature;[499] and this seed has fallen upon fruitful soil in modern\r\nyouth. Every young blockhead inflates himself with his “masculine\r\npride,” and feels himself to be the “knight of the spirit” in relation\r\nto the inferior sex; every disillusioned and satiated debauchee\r\ncultivates (as a rule, indeed, transiently) the fashion of misogyny,\r\nwhich strengthens his sentiment of self-esteem. If we wish to speak at\r\nall of “physiological weak-mindedness,” let us apply the term to this\r\ndisagreeable type of men. As Georg Hirth truly remarks (“Ways to\r\nFreedom,” p. 281), such masculine =arrogance= is merely a variety of\r\n“mental defect.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this misogyny has intruded itself also into science. The\r\nwork of P. J. Möbius,[500] notwithstanding the esteem I feel for the\r\nvaluable services of the celebrated neurologist in other departments,\r\ncan only be termed an aberration, a _lapsus calami_.[501] But he does\r\nnot stand alone. The admirable work of Heinrich Schurtz, also, upon “Age\r\nClasses and Associations of Men” (Berlin, 1902), is permeated by this\r\nmisogynist aura; not less so is the equally stimulating work, “The Vital\r\nLaws of Civilization” (Halle, 1904), by Eduard von Mayer. This book, in\r\nassociation with the equally thoughtful and compendious work “The\r\nRenascence of Eros Uranios” (Berlin, 1904), by Benedikt Friedländer, and\r\nin conjunction with the efforts of Adolf Brand, the editor of the\r\nhomosexual newspaper _Der Eigene_, and Edwin Bab (_cf._ this writer’s\r\n“The Woman’s Movement and the Love of Friends”; Berlin, 1904), to found\r\na special homosexual group demanding the “=emancipation of men=,” have\r\nbeen the principal causes of the belief that the male homosexuals are\r\nthe true “repudiators of woman,” and that from them has proceeded the\r\nincreasing diffusion of modern misogyny. I repeat that this connexion is\r\ntrue only for the above-named group; that, on the contrary, genuine\r\nmisogyny has been taught us by the world’s typically heterosexual men,\r\nsuch as Schopenhauer and Strindberg. Benedikt Friedländer and Eduard von\r\nMayer preached, above all, a “masculine civilization,” a deepening of\r\nthe spiritual relationships between men; whereas Strindberg and\r\nSchopenhauer, and even Weininger, really leave us in uncertainty as to\r\nwhat they imagine is to take woman’s place. All five agree in this, that\r\nthe “intercourse” of man with woman is to be limited as much as\r\npossible; but only the two first-named openly and freely advocate\r\nhomosexual relationships, or at least a “physiological friendship” (B.\r\nFriedländer), between men. Schopenhauer, Strindberg, and Weininger did\r\nnot venture to deduce these consequences. Yet this is the =necessary=\r\nconsequence of misogyny based on principle.\r\n\r\nTo the heterosexual men--and such men form an =enormous majority=--the\r\nnoble, ideal, asexual friendship of man for man appears in quite another\r\nlight from that in which it appears to the misogynist, to whom it is to\r\nserve to =replace= sexual love, whereas for heterosexual men friendship\r\nfor other men is a valuable treasure =additional= to the love of woman.\r\n\r\nIs there, then, any reason for this contempt and hatred for woman? Do\r\nnot the signs increase on all hands to show us that =new= relationships\r\nare forming between the sexes, that a number of new points of contact of\r\nthe spiritual nature are making their appearance--in a word, that =an\r\nentirely new, nobler, most promising amatory life= is developing? I will\r\nnot fall into the contrary error to misogyny and inscribe a dithyramb of\r\npraise to feminine nature, as Wedde, Daumer, Quensel, Groddeck, and\r\nothers, have done; but I merely indicate the signs of the times when I\r\nsay =that woman also is awakening=! Woman is awakening to the entirely\r\nnew existence of a free personality, conscious of her rights and of her\r\nduties. Woman, also, will have her share in the content and in the tasks\r\nof life; she will not enslave us, as the misogynists clamour, for she\r\nwishes to see =free men= by her side. What would become of woman if men\r\nbecame slaves? How could slaves give love?\r\n\r\nLife has to-day become a difficult task both for man and for woman. Man\r\nand woman alike must endeavour to perform that task with confidence in\r\ntheir respective powers; but each, also, must have confidence in the\r\npowers of the other--a confidence which becomes =palpable= in the form\r\nof love or friendship, so that those who feel it have their own powers\r\nstrengthened.\r\n\r\nNot “Free =from= woman” is the watchword of the future, but “Free =with=\r\nwoman.”\r\n\r\n  [491] V. Hoffmann, in a bad novel, “Das vierte Geschlecht” (Berlin,\r\n  1902), gives this name to the non-homosexual misogynists.\r\n\r\n  [492] Karl Gutzkow, “Säkularbilder,” vol. i., p. 55 (Frankfurt, 1846).\r\n\r\n  [493] In the Shi-king we find the following characterization of woman:\r\n\r\n  “Enough for her to avoid evil,\r\n   For what can a woman do that is good?”\r\n\r\n  Indian literature is also full of such ideas. _Cf._ H. Schurtz,\r\n  “Altersklassen und Männerbunde” (Age Classes and Associations of Men),\r\n  p. 52.\r\n\r\n  [494] Simonides considered that women were derived from various\r\n  animals. W. Schubert (“From the Berlin Collection of Papyri,”\r\n  published in the _Vossische Zeitung_, No. 23, January 15, 1907)\r\n  reproduces long fragments of a Greek anthology which collates praise\r\n  and blame of woman in the original words of the poets.\r\n\r\n  [495] I quote from “The Plays of Euripides in English,” in two\r\n  volumes, vol. ii., p. 136 (Everyman’s Library, Dent,\r\n  London).--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n  [496] H. T. Finck, “Romantic Love and Personal Beauty,” vol. i., pp.\r\n  186, 187 (Breslau, 1894).\r\n\r\n  [497] Equally amusing is the misogynist “Alphabet de l’Imperfection et\r\n  Malice des Femmes,” by Jacques Olivier (Rouen, 1646), in which all the\r\n  bad qualities of woman, observed down to the year 1646, are described\r\n  with effective care and completeness.\r\n\r\n  [498] We know that Schopenhauer was a lover of erotic writings; a\r\n  fuller account of this matter will be found in Grisebach’s\r\n  “Conversations and Soliloquies of Schopenhauer.”\r\n\r\n  [499] That Nietzsche is wrongly accredited with misogyny is\r\n  convincingly proved by Helene Stocker (“Nietzsches Frauenfeindschaft,”\r\n  published in _Zukunft_, 1903; reprinted in “Love and Women,” pp.\r\n  65-74; Minden, 1906).\r\n\r\n  [500] P. J. Möbius, “The Physiological Weak-mindedness of Woman,”\r\n  fourth edition (Halle, 1902).

But it\r\n=exists=. About that there is no doubt.\r\n\r\nIn the years 1905 and 1906 I was occupied almost exclusively with the\r\nproblem of homosexuality, and I had the opportunity of seeing and\r\nexamining a very large number of genuine homosexual individuals, both\r\nmen and women. I was able to observe them during long periods, both at\r\nhome and in public life. I learnt to know them--their mode of life,\r\ntheir habits, their opinions, their whole activity, not only in relation\r\nto one another, but also in relation to other non-homosexual individuals\r\nand to persons of the opposite sex. This experience taught me the\r\nindubitable fact that the diffusion of true homosexuality as a\r\ncongenital natural phenomenon is =far greater= than I had earlier\r\nassumed;[502] so that I find myself now compelled to separate from true\r\nhomosexuality the other category of =acquired, apparent, occasional\r\nhomosexuality=, of the existence of which I am now, as formerly, =firmly\r\nconvinced=. I denote this latter by the term “=pseudo-homosexuality=,”\r\nand treat of it in a separate chapter.\r\n\r\nFormerly I believed that true homosexuality was only a variety of\r\npseudo-homosexuality--in a sense larval pseudo-homosexuality. Now,\r\nhowever, I must recognize that true homosexuality constitutes a =special\r\nwell-defined group=, sharply distinguishable from all forms of\r\npseudo-homosexuality. From my medical observations, which have been as\r\nexact and objective as possible, I must draw the conclusion that among\r\n=thoroughly healthy individuals= of both sexes, not to be distinguished\r\nfrom other normal human beings, there appears =in very early childhood=,\r\nand certainly not evoked by any kind of external influence, an\r\n=inclination=, and after puberty a =sexual impulse, towards persons of\r\nthe same sex=; and that this inclination and this impulse are =as\r\nlittle to be altered= as it is possible to expel from a heterosexual man\r\nthe impulse towards woman.\r\n\r\nAbove all, in this definition of true original homosexuality I lay the\r\nstress upon the word “=healthy=”; for von Krafft-Ebing, though he admits\r\nthe existence of congenital homosexuality yet regards it as a morbid\r\ndegenerative phenomenon, as the expression of severe hereditary taint\r\nand of a neuro-psychopathic constitution; and this view is shared by\r\nmany alienists.[503] Now, we must admit that a =portion= of genuine\r\nhomosexuals--just as is the case with a portion of heterosexual\r\nindividuals--possess such a morbid constitution; and we must acknowledge\r\nthat yet =another portion= exhibit =manifestations of nervousness= and\r\nneurasthenia, which, beyond doubt, have developed during life out of an\r\noriginally healthy state, in consequence of the struggle for life, the\r\npainful experience of being “different” from the great mass of people,\r\netc.; but we ascertain that a =third=, and, in fact, the =largest,\r\nsection= of original homosexuals are thoroughly =healthy, free from\r\nhereditary taint, physically and psychically normal=.\r\n\r\nI have observed a great number of homosexuals belonging to all ages and\r\noccupations in whom not the slightest trace of morbidity was to be\r\ndetected. They were just as healthy and normal as are heterosexuals. At\r\nan earlier date, though I was not yet aware of the relatively great\r\nfrequency of true original homosexuality, it had become clear to me, on\r\nthe ground of my own anthropological theory of sexual anomalies, that\r\nhomosexuality might just as well appear in healthy human beings as in\r\ndiseased. Therein I have always agreed with Magnus Hirschfeld, the\r\nprincipal advocate of this view, in opposition to the theory of the\r\ndegenerative nature of homosexuality. For me there is no longer any\r\ndoubt =that homosexuality is compatible with complete mental and\r\nphysical health=.\r\n\r\nIt is very interesting to note that von Krafft-Ebing himself later came\r\nto the same view, and thus formally abandoned the degenerative\r\nhypothesis. In his “New Studies in the Domain of Homosexuality” he\r\nwrites:[504]\r\n\r\n  “In view of the experience that contrary sexuality is a congenital\r\n  anomaly, that it represents a disturbance in the evolution of the\r\n  sexual life, and of the physical and mental development, in normal\r\n  relationship to the kind of reproductive glands which the individual\r\n  possesses, =it has become impossible to maintain in this connexion the\r\n  idea of ‘disease.’= Rather, in such a case we must speak of a\r\n  malformation, and treat the anomaly as parallel with physical\r\n  malformation--for example, anatomical deviations from the structural\r\n  type. At the same time, the assumption of a simultaneous psychopathia\r\n  is not prejudiced, for persons who exhibit such an anatomical\r\n  differentiation from type (_stigmata degenerationis_) =may remain\r\n  physically healthy throughout life, and even be above the average in\r\n  this respect=. Of course, a difference from the generality so\r\n  important as contrary sexual sensation must have a much greater\r\n  importance to the psyche than the majority of other anatomical or\r\n  functional variations. In this way it is to be explained that a\r\n  disturbance in the development in the normal sexual life may often be\r\n  antagonistic to the development of a harmonious psychical personality.\r\n\r\n  “Not infrequently in the case of those with contrary sexuality do we\r\n  find neuropathic and psychopathic predispositions, as, for example,\r\n  predisposition to constitutional neurasthenia and hysteria, to the\r\n  milder forms of periodic psychosis, to the inhibition of the\r\n  development of psychical energy (intelligence, moral sense), and in\r\n  some of these cases the ethical deficiency (especially when\r\n  hypersexuality is associated with the contrary sexuality) may lead to\r\n  the most severe aberrations of the sexual impulse. And yet we can\r\n  always prove that, relatively speaking, the heterosexual are apt to be\r\n  much more depraved than the homosexual.\r\n\r\n  “Moreover, other manifestations of degeneration in the sexual spheres,\r\n  in the form of sadism, masochism, and fetichism, are relatively much\r\n  commoner among the former.\r\n\r\n  “That contrary sexual sensation =cannot= thus be necessarily regarded\r\n  as =psychical= degeneration, or even as a manifestation of disease, is\r\n  shown by various considerations, one of the principal of which is\r\n  =that these variations of the sexual life may actually be associated\r\n  with mental superiority=.... The proof of this is the existence of men\r\n  of all nations whose contrary sexuality is an established fact, and\r\n  who, none the less, are the pride of their nation as authors, poets,\r\n  artists, leaders of armies, and statesmen.\r\n\r\n  “A further proof of the fact that contrary sexual sensation is =not\r\n  necessarily disease, nor necessarily a vicious self-surrender to the\r\n  immoral=, is to be found in the fact that all the noble activities of\r\n  the heart which can be associated with heterosexual love can equally\r\n  be associated with homosexual love... in the form of noble-mindedness,\r\n  self-sacrifice, philanthropy, artistic sense, poietic activity, etc.,\r\n  but also the passions and defects of love (jealousy, suicide, murder,\r\n  unhappy love, with its deleterious influence on soul and body, etc.).”\r\n\r\nAccording to my own investigations and observations, the =relationship\r\nbetween health and disease= is among homosexuals =originally identical\r\nwith that among heterosexuals=, and only in the course of life, in\r\nconsequence of the social and individual isolation of the homosexual,\r\nwhich acts on them as a =psychical trauma=, is this relationship\r\nsomewhat altered in favour of the predominance of disease. Here,\r\nhowever, we have, as a rule, to do chiefly with =acquired= nervous\r\ntroubles and disorders, with the development of a peculiar type of\r\n“=homosexual neurasthenia=,” and in these cases by superficial observers\r\nthere may easily be a confusion between _post hoc_ and _propter hoc_.\r\n\r\nMagnus Hirschfeld, who unquestionably possesses, relatively and\r\nabsolutely, the greatest experience in the domain of homosexuality,\r\nmaintains[505] that, according to his material of investigation--and\r\nthis is of gigantic extent--at least 75 % of homosexuals are born of\r\nhealthy parents and of happy marriages, often prolific marriages, and\r\nthat nervous or mental anomalies, alcoholism, blood-relationship, and\r\nsyphilis are no more frequent among the ancestors of homosexuals than\r\namong the ancestors of those endowed with normal sexuality. Only among\r\nfrom 20 to 25 % of homosexuals was he able, in conjunction with E.\r\nBurchard, to find hereditary taint. Only in 16 % could they find\r\nwell-developed “stigmata of degeneration”; and, indeed, those with\r\nstigmata were throughout hereditarily tainted. This view is supported\r\nalso by the facts (to which I already alluded in my “Etiology of\r\nPsychopathia Sexualis”) that homosexuality is universally diffused in\r\nspace and time; that it is independent of civilization, occurs among\r\nsavage races who are not exposed to the conditions giving rise to\r\ndegeneration in the same degree as civilized races; and that it is\r\nprevalent in the country, where the degenerative influence of life in\r\nlarge towns is not operative.\r\n\r\nThe most important characteristic of genuine homosexuality, its\r\n=spontaneous appearance very early in life=, which can only be referred\r\nto natural inheritance, appears to me to be a fact proved altogether\r\nbeyond dispute. Men of the highest and most respected professions--above\r\nall, =judges=, =practising physicians=, =men of science=, =theologians=,\r\nand =scholars=--have described themselves to me as having been through\r\nand through homosexual from early childhood, so that I am thoroughly\r\nconvinced that primary homosexuality makes its appearance at any rate\r\nvery early in life.\r\n\r\nThe reports of physicians are of especially great importance. Hirschfeld\r\n(_op. cit._, p. 12) quotes the utterance of a leading alienist, himself\r\nhomosexual: “I can and must declare that I have never known a case of\r\nhomosexuality which I could regard as other than congenital,” and the\r\naccuracy of this statement has been confirmed to me personally by\r\nseveral homosexual physicians. The idea “congenital” harmonizes very\r\nwell with the demonstrable casual =objective= cause of the first\r\nhomosexual tendencies, which we are able to learn in almost every case\r\nof homosexuality. These can, as is well known, also occur transiently in\r\nheterosexual individuals--a matter which is discussed in the chapter\r\n“Pseudo-Homosexuality.” In the case of genuine homosexuality, however,\r\nthese homosexual activities play from the very beginning a predominant\r\nrôle, and =remain permanent=, because they result from a natural\r\ninheritance, from a deeply rooted impulse. This is shown in the\r\nfollowing interesting autobiography of a man of letters thirty years of\r\nage:\r\n\r\n  “From my earliest childhood there was something girlish in my whole\r\n  nature, both outwardly and (more especially) inwardly. I was very\r\n  quiet, obedient, diligent, sensitive to praise and blame, rather\r\n  bright. I associated chiefly with adults, and was generally beloved.\r\n  Sexual activity began in me unusually early. When I was about six\r\n  years of age a tutor sat down on my bed, in which I was lying in a\r\n  fever. He caressed me, and with his hand _membrum meum tetigit_. The\r\n  voluptuous sensation which resulted was so intense that it has never\r\n  disappeared from my memory. At school, where I always distinguished\r\n  myself by my application and success, I sometimes enjoyed mutual\r\n  ‘feeling’ with several other boys. From which side I inherited the\r\n  unusual intensity of the sexual impulse I do not know, but I remember\r\n  that when I was about twelve years old I already suffered a good deal\r\n  from sexual desire, and that it came to me as a solution of a great\r\n  difficulty when a comrade instructed me in the practice of\r\n  masturbation. It is remarkable that for some time afterwards there was\r\n  no evacuation of semen. When this first appeared I was very much\r\n  alarmed and disquieted, but I soon became accustomed to it, and this\r\n  the more readily because I had no doubt whatever that all men\r\n  regularly indulged in the same pleasure. This ‘paradisaical’ state did\r\n  not, however, last for long; and after a time, when I recognized the\r\n  unnatural and dangerous nature of my conduct, I conducted a severe and\r\n  unsuccessful contest against my desires. In my life generally I had a\r\n  good deal to bear, and I can say that I have hardly preserved a single\r\n  really pleasant memory of my past; and yet I could look back to this\r\n  past with a certain pride and satisfaction if it had not been that the\r\n  sexual side of my life has left such gloomy shadows in my soul.\r\n\r\n  “I remember that from very early days my eyes involuntarily turned\r\n  with longing towards elderly vigorous men, but I did not pay much\r\n  attention to this fact. I believed that I only practised masturbation\r\n  (the influence of which I doubtless exaggerate in memory to some\r\n  extent) because it was not possible for me to have sexual intercourse\r\n  with women. I was accustomed sometimes to have friendly association\r\n  with young girls, who appeared to be extremely attracted towards me. I\r\n  always took care, however, that such love tendencies were nipped in\r\n  the bud, because I felt that it was impossible for me to go any\r\n  further with them. Ultimately I determined to seek salvation in\r\n  intercourse with prostitutes, although they were disagreeable to my\r\n  æsthetic and moral feelings; but I got no help here: either I was\r\n  unable to complete the normal sexual act, or in other cases it was\r\n  completed without any particular pleasure, and I was always consumed\r\n  with anxiety with respect to infection. I had, indeed, often the\r\n  opportunity of forming an ‘intimacy’ with a woman, but I did not do\r\n  it, and always supposed that my failure to do so depended upon my\r\n  ridiculous bashfulness and upon the excessive sensitiveness of my\r\n  conscience. But though there is some truth in both of these\r\n  suggestions, I have not taken into account the principal\r\n  grounds--namely, that I am congenitally homosexual, and that I feel no\r\n  physical attraction, or almost none, towards the other sex. This\r\n  suffices to explain the fact (which can be explained in no other way)\r\n  that when masturbating I almost always represented in imagination\r\n  handsome elderly men. In my lascivious dreams, also, such men play the\r\n  principal rôle. These longings were so powerful that it was impossible\r\n  that I should not soon have my attention directed to them; but as I\r\n  could not understand them and would not take the matter seriously (I\r\n  knew, indeed, that man =must= feel drawn towards woman, and not\r\n  towards man), I continued unceasingly and despairingly to fight\r\n  against these fixed ideas, while at the same time with varying success\r\n  I endeavoured to cure myself of masturbation; for in the first place\r\n  it now gave very little satisfaction, and in the second place it\r\n  destroyed my hopes of eventually procreating healthy children. I had\r\n  almost come to believe myself no longer competent for the sexual life\r\n  when I noticed one day that the view of a _membrum virile_ set my\r\n  blood flowing fiercely. I then remembered that this had sometimes\r\n  happened before, although to a less marked extent. I was now compelled\r\n  to recognize that I was not the same as every one else. This fact,\r\n  which I had before suspected, and of which I now became more and more\r\n  firmly convinced, reduced me to despair, which was all the greater\r\n  because in other ways I felt extremely unhappy, and because I did not\r\n  dare to speak of it to any human being. Sometimes I still thought that\r\n  there must be some ‘misunderstanding,’ and that there must be some\r\n  salvation for me. Then it happened that a simple girl fell in love\r\n  with me, and I went so far as to enter into an intimacy with her,\r\n  although I openly assured her that as far as I was concerned it was\r\n  simply a matter of physical enjoyment, and that I could not in any way\r\n  make myself responsible for her future, for which reason care must be\r\n  taken that there should be no offspring. During this intimacy, which\r\n  lasted several months, I sometimes overcame my enduring inclinations\r\n  towards men, but completely to suppress them was impossible. My\r\n  association with the girl was still continuing, when one day in a\r\n  public lavatory I saw an elderly gentleman whose appearance greatly\r\n  pleased me. He looked at me tentatively. Cautiously he leaned over, in\r\n  order _membrum meum videre_; he gradually drew near to me, moved his\r\n  shaking hand and ... _membrum meum tetigit_. I was so much surprised\r\n  and alarmed that I ran away, and avoided for some time afterwards\r\n  passing by the same place. All the stronger, however, was the impulse\r\n  to find this remarkable man once more, and this was not at all\r\n  difficult. What an enigma such a man seemed to me! How could it\r\n  happen that he dared to do that of which I had always been able only\r\n  to think, to dream, with heart-quaking and horror? Could there,\r\n  perhaps, be another man like this--perhaps several such exceptional\r\n  beings? A short period convinced me that I was not quite alone in my\r\n  way of feeling; but this was a weak consolation. Rather, since that\r\n  time--that is to say, during the last five years--my inward battle has\r\n  become more unbearable, for earlier my only battle was to reject\r\n  homosexual ideas, and to overcome the habit of solitary self-abuse.\r\n  Now sometimes I practise with another mutual onanism (to me the proper\r\n  ‘natural’ mode of sexual gratification), and yet I cannot forgive\r\n  myself for doing it because it is effected in so unæsthetic a manner,\r\n  and is associated with such dangers. Notwithstanding all my\r\n  endeavours, however, I have never been able to resist the temptation\r\n  for a long time together; and thus I am hunted always by my impulse as\r\n  by a wild animal, and can nowhere and in nothing find repose and\r\n  forgetfulness. I have frequently changed my place of residence, but I\r\n  always before long form new ‘relationships.’ The tortures which I\r\n  suffer in consequence of the incomparable power of the impulse are\r\n  greater them I can possibly express in words. I can only wonder that I\r\n  did not lose my reason, and that in the eyes of my friends and\r\n  acquaintances I am now, as before, ‘the most normal of all human\r\n  beings.’ In the senseless and utterly unsuccessful contest with an\r\n  impulse which, as far as I am concerned, is wholly, or almost wholly,\r\n  congenital, I have lost the best of my powers, although I have long\r\n  recognized the fact that this impulse in and by itself is neither\r\n  morbid nor sinful, for a divergence from the norm is not a disease,\r\n  and the gratification of a natural impulse, which in no respect and\r\n  for no human being leads to evil consequences, cannot be regarded as\r\n  sinful. Why, then, must I continue to strive against this impulse like\r\n  a madman? Because it is very generally misunderstood, so unpardonably\r\n  condemned. What help is it that I am now surrounded by love and\r\n  respect? I know that so many would turn away from me with horror if\r\n  they were to learn my sexual constitution, although it is a matter\r\n  which does not concern them at all. Scorn and contempt would then be\r\n  my lot. I should be regarded by the majority of human beings as a\r\n  libertine; whereas I feel and know that, notwithstanding all the\r\n  sensuality of my nature, I have been created for some other purpose\r\n  than simply to follow my lustful desire. Who will believe that I\r\n  suffer in the struggle with myself? Who will have compassion upon me?\r\n  This idea is intolerable. I am condemned to eternal solitude. I have\r\n  not the moral right to found a home, to embrace a child who would give\r\n  me the name of ‘father.’ Is not this punishment sufficiently severe\r\n  for God knows what sins? Why, then, should the consciousness be\r\n  superadded that I am a pariah, an outcast from society? Owing to the\r\n  opinion of society regarding the homosexual--an opinion based upon\r\n  ignorance, stupidity, and ill-nature--society drives these unhappy\r\n  beings to death (or to a marriage which in their case is criminal),\r\n  and then triumphantly exclaims: ‘Look what degenerate beings they\r\n  are!’ No, they are not degenerates, those whose lives you have made\r\n  unbearable; they are for the most part spiritually and morally very\r\n  healthy human beings. I will speak of myself. Why do I long for death?\r\n  Certainly not because I am mentally abnormal. I am no morbid\r\n  pessimist, and I know well enough that life can be very beautiful.\r\n  But, unfortunately, it cannot be so for me; for my life is a hell; I\r\n  am intolerably weary of my internal conflict; it has become horribly\r\n  difficult to me to play the hypocrite, to pretend continually to be a\r\n  happy man rejoicing in life; I am bending beneath the burden of my\r\n  heavy iron mask. Recently I had myself hypnotized, in order to have my\r\n  thoughts turned away as far as possible from sexual matters. My\r\n  hypnotist said to me: ‘You see, you will be at rest now,’ and\r\n  involuntarily in sleep I had to swallow these words, ‘Be at rest’!\r\n  Good God, is that possible? Does the ‘normal’ man know how this word\r\n  sounds in our ears? Who will understand my intolerable pain? Perhaps\r\n  my dear parents could have done so, as they loved me above all, as if\r\n  they had a presentiment that I should be the most unhappy of their\r\n  children; but they have been dead for several years, and so,\r\n  notwithstanding my numerous relatives and friends, I stand quite alone\r\n  in this world, and vainly seek an answer to the questions ‘Why?’ and\r\n  ‘Wherefore?’”\r\n\r\nGenuine homosexuality exhibits, like heterosexuality, the character of\r\nan impulse arising from the =very nature= of the personality, which, in\r\nactivity from the cradle to the grave, expresses the =continuity of the\r\nindividual= in respect also of this peculiar sexual tendency. Thus there\r\ndoes not exist a homosexuality =limited= merely to a certain age of\r\nlife, as to childhood or youth, to maturity, or even to old age. Hence\r\nwe must distinguish from genuine homosexuality the pæderasty of old men\r\ndescribed by Schopenhauer, which does not begin till old age appears. We\r\nmust distinguish, also, the love of Greek boys for elderly men; these\r\nmust be included in the category of =pseudo-homosexuality=. An\r\ninclination which, like original homosexuality, is an =outflow of the\r\nessential nature= of the individual concerned, cannot disappear so long\r\nas the individual himself persists, cannot begin or end except with the\r\nbeginning or end of his life. Homosexuality extends throughout the\r\nlifetime, and if by any cause whatever--for example, enforced\r\nmarriage--it is apparently temporarily suppressed, it always reappears.\r\nIt seems very doubtful if there really exists, as von Krafft-Ebing[506]\r\nassumes, a genuine =retarded= homosexuality--that is, original\r\nhomosexuality which does not manifest itself until a comparatively\r\nadvanced age. There do, doubtless, exist transient cases of\r\npseudo-homosexuality, which have in some cases developed in those\r\npreviously heterosexual, and which in other cases are superimposed upon\r\na bisexual basis. These belong to the category of “=acquired=”\r\nhomosexuality, which is always a pseudo-homosexuality.\r\n\r\nThe course of life of genuine homosexuals is a complete expression of\r\nthe results of simple inversion of the sexual impulse, and the\r\nhomosexual type makes its appearance in childhood. The fact of the\r\n“=difference=” between the homosexual and others is not experienced\r\nmerely by the person himself, but is also noticed =very early= by those\r\nwho have care of him. The “girlish” (in the case of female\r\nhomosexuality, “boyish”) and “peculiar” nature is often observed by\r\nmembers of the family, by comrades, and by tutors, and gives rise to the\r\nuse of nicknames. These manifestations and perceptions are a valuable\r\nobjective confirmation of the subjective sensations of homosexual\r\nchildren. A Protestant clergyman whose homosexual son also studied\r\ntheology remarked to M. Hirschfeld: “He was from the very beginning\r\ndifferent from my five other sons.” The physical and moral peculiarities\r\npresently to be described are often manifested in very early childhood.\r\nHirschfeld has frequently been able to diagnose “homosexuality” in\r\nchildren from ten to fourteen years of age. He alludes, among others, to\r\na very timid boy, twelve years of age, who suffered from migraine, who\r\ncried frequently, who kept himself apart from his schoolfellows, and\r\ncorresponded daily with a boy friend. He was fond of flowers and music;\r\nhe had very little inclination to mathematics (according to Hirschfeld,\r\na somewhat characteristic phenomenon in cases of homosexuality). The\r\nexamination of the boy, who was extremely bashful, showed that =the\r\ngenital organs were still completely undeveloped=, the penis resembling\r\nthat of a boy of four years, whilst the breasts were markedly developed\r\nlike those of a girl at the commencement of puberty.\r\n\r\nI doubt whether the fondness on the part of boys for girls’ games, or on\r\nthe part of girls for boys’ games, can be regarded as a symptom of\r\ndiagnostic importance in regard to the existence of homosexuality, for a\r\nfondness for playing with girls and for cooking may often be observed in\r\nboys who later prove thoroughly heterosexual. Still, these things do\r\nplay a great part in the autobiography of homosexuals, and have, in\r\nfact, great importance in cases in which these tendencies persist\r\n=after= puberty, when the heterosexually differentiated psyche would,\r\nafter the transitory episode of these youthful games, display activities\r\nnow corresponding to the fully developed sexual sensibility.\r\n\r\nPuberty is the most important period with regard to the final\r\n=determination= of homosexuality by means of particular =physical= and\r\n=mental= characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of the physical and mental characters of male\r\nhomosexuals leads clearly to the distinction of two different types--the\r\n=effeminate= and the =virile= urnings. With regard to the relative\r\nnumbers of these two types there exist no definite data. Hirschfeld, in\r\nhis “Urnings,” describes chiefly the type of the more or less effeminate\r\nurnings--that is, of those who show the greatest resemblance to the\r\nfeminine nature--and does not express an opinion as to whether the\r\nnumber of effeminate homosexuals is greater than the number of virile\r\nhomosexuals--that is, of those whose nature is predominantly masculine.\r\nAnother experienced observer of urnings, Dr. J. E. Meisner,[507] is of\r\nopinion that in the =majority= of cases the male type of homosexuals is\r\nencountered rather than the female. According to my own observations, it\r\nappears to me that the number of virile and of effeminate urnings is\r\nabout identical.[508] There are certainly numerous virile homosexuals,\r\nor rather homosexuals of a thoroughly =masculine= build of body, without\r\ngreat deviations from the normal type, who yet have a more or less\r\nfeminine mode of sensibility. The distinction between effeminate and\r\nvirile homosexuals would appear therefore to be only relative, and for\r\nthe majority of cases Hirschfeld’s remarks (“Urnings,” p. 86) apply:\r\n\r\n  “A homosexual who was not distinguishable physically and mentally from\r\n  the complete man is a being I have not yet encountered among fifteen\r\n  hundred cases, and I am therefore unable to believe in the existence\r\n  of such until I personally encounter one.”\r\n\r\nMore especially after removing any beard or moustache that may be\r\npresent, we sometimes see much more clearly the feminine expression of\r\nface in a male homosexual, whilst before the hair was removed they\r\nappeared quite man-like. Still more important for the determination of a\r\nfeminine habitus are direct physical characteristics. Among these there\r\nmust be mentioned a =considerable deposit of fat=, by which the\r\nresemblance to the feminine type is produced, the contours of the body\r\nbeing more rounded than in the case of the normal male. In\r\ncorrespondence with this the =muscular system= is less powerfully\r\ndeveloped than it is in heterosexual men, the skin is delicate and soft,\r\nand the complexion is much clearer than is usual in men. Last winter I\r\nattended an urnings’ ball, and I was much impressed, when looking at the\r\n_décolleté_ men, with the remarkable whiteness of their skin on the\r\nshoulders, neck, and back--also in those who had not applied powder--and\r\nby the fact that the little acne spots almost always present in normal\r\nmen were absent in these. The peculiar rounding of the shoulders was\r\nalso remarkable, from its resemblance to what one sees in women.\r\n\r\nAccording to Hirschfeld, the skin of the urning almost always feels\r\nwarmer than his environment. He refers the expression commonly used\r\namong the people (in Germany), “warm brothers,” to this circumstance,\r\nand derives the Latin _homo mollis_ (“soft man”) from the softness of\r\nthe skin and of the muscular system (though in my opinion this term is\r\napplied rather to the =entire= effeminate, soft nature of the urning).\r\nOf great interest is the relation =between the breadth of the shoulders\r\nand the width of the pelvis= in homosexual men. Whilst the breadth of\r\nthe shoulders of heterosexual men is several centimetres in excess of\r\nthe width of the pelvis, and in women the width of the pelvis is greater\r\nthan the breadth of the shoulders, according to Hirschfeld in the urning\r\nthere is little or no difference between these two measurements. This,\r\nin respect of the bodily structure, would completely justify the\r\nexpression “intermediate stage,” and would give the homosexual man a\r\nposition between the heterosexual man and the heterosexual woman. Still,\r\nthere are, without doubt, numerous virile homosexual men in whom this\r\ngreat width of the pelvis is not present. Investigations regarding the\r\ncorresponding relationships among homosexual women have not to my\r\nknowledge hitherto been made. Very striking is the =often luxuriant\r\ngrowth of hair=, especially in the effeminate types, whereas the virile\r\nhomosexuals are in this respect more approximate to normal men, baldness\r\nbeing common among them.\r\n\r\nOur attention having been recently directed by the investigation of H.\r\nSwoboda to the existence of =equivalents of menstruation= in men, the\r\noccurrence of such equivalents among urnings is of interest. Hirschfeld\r\nreports the case of an effeminate homosexual who since the age of\r\nfourteen had suffered at intervals of twenty-eight days from migraine,\r\nassociated with severe pains in the back and loins, so that his\r\nstepmother said to him: “It is with you just as it is with us.”\r\n\r\nThe =gait= and the =movements= of effeminate urnings also have a\r\nsomewhat womanly appearance, and attract the attention even of one who\r\nis not in the secret. Short, tripping paces and elegant movements are\r\ncharacteristic of the effeminate.\r\n\r\nIn an earlier chapter we came to the conclusion that the fully adult\r\nnormal woman was approximate in physical characteristics rather to the\r\nchild and to the youthful human being than to the adult man; and in this\r\nconnexion it is of interest that we must describe as a distinctively\r\n=feminine= characteristic the peculiarity of many male homosexuals,\r\nwhich enables them =for a long time to preserve a youthful appearance\r\nand demeanour=.\r\n\r\nVery remarkable is the behaviour of the voice. The change in the voice\r\nmay not occur at all, or does not occur till very late. The capacity for\r\nsinging soprano or falsetto is also long preserved. Others, in whom the\r\nchange of voice had failed to occur, were able to lower the pitch\r\nconsiderably by practice. A typical and well-known example is that of\r\nthe baritone singer Willibald von Sadler-Grün, whom I had the\r\nopportunity of hearing recently, when, under the name of “Urany Verde,”\r\nhe made a professional journey through Germany, and sang his songs\r\ndressed as a woman. He said of himself: “My voice has never cracked in a\r\ndefinite way. At twenty-three years of age I could sing soprano, and can\r\nstill do so to-day, at the age of thirty. The deeper tones for speech\r\nand singing I acquired only by instruction and practice” (Hirschfeld,\r\n“Urnings,” p. 65). In this typical effeminate, the breasts also had a\r\ncompletely feminine character, as, according to Hirschfeld, is by no\r\nmeans rare in boy urnings, who at puberty experience swelling of the\r\nbreasts, associated with painful sensations.[509] I must, however,\r\nmaintain, in opposition to Hirschfeld, that abnormally marked\r\ndevelopment of the breasts is by no means rare in perfectly normal\r\nheterosexual men. For the diagnosis of homosexuality, the imperfect\r\ndevelopment of the larynx, and the failure of the voice to crack, are\r\nmore important than the marked development of the breasts. I remember\r\ndistinctly that in the case of a fellow-student of mine years ago his\r\nhigh voice used greatly to strike me. To-day I am able to understand how\r\nthis fact was associated with his complete disinclination to sexual\r\nintercourse with women and his insensibility to feminine charms in\r\ngeneral; and I am able in his case to diagnose homosexuality with\r\nabsolute certainty.\r\n\r\nIn the case of =virile= homosexuals, all the above-mentioned physical\r\npeculiarities are far less noticeable. In their outward appearance they\r\nmuch more nearly resemble heterosexual men, but still they always have\r\n=comparatively= more of the feminine in their nature than the latter.\r\nSuch a typically virile homosexual, in whose appearance the impression\r\nof femininity was entirely absent, I was able recently to recognize\r\nduring a railway journey, in the course of which he confided to me\r\nmisogynous opinions against other fellow-travellers, and also said that\r\nin the whole of his life--he was a man of a little over thirty--he had\r\nnot had intercourse with women more than three or four times. During the\r\nlong wait of the train at a station I took the opportunity, having\r\nmentioned that I was a physician by profession, to ask him if he was not\r\nhomosexual, a fact which he at once admitted. Already in very early\r\nchildhood he had felt himself distinctly drawn only towards masculine\r\nbeings, and had =never= experienced the least inclination towards women.\r\nIn this case also any kind of outward influence was excluded, because he\r\nhad grown up at home and chiefly in a =feminine= environment. As I have\r\nalready said, in appearance he was masculine, and he himself stated that\r\nhe had no physical characteristics which suggested a feminine\r\nimpression. That this is the case in numerous virile homosexuals is\r\nproved by the distinctive fact that many of them are =professional\r\nsoldiers=, especially officers, in respect of whose appearance virility\r\nis very strongly insisted on.\r\n\r\nThe =mental= qualities of male homosexuals correspond fully to the\r\nphysical, and occupy a middle region between the psyche of the\r\nheterosexual man and that of woman. But every =emotional element= is in\r\nthem more prominent than energetic will-power and clear-sighted reason.\r\nSomething soft and pliable is characteristic of the majority of urnings.\r\nThis adaptability manifests itself in good-humouredness, in inclination\r\nto self-sacrifice, but, above all, in a most astonishing =mobility of\r\nthe imaginative life=, which seems to be something characteristic of the\r\nhomosexual, and to explain his frequent artistic capacity, above all his\r\ntalents for =music=, for which vocation, indeed, his less fixed and more\r\nsketchy nature especially fits him, but also for poetry, painting,\r\nacting, and sculpture. “For all the fine arts,” says Hirschfeld, “from\r\ncooking and artistic needlework to sculpture, we find that urnings have\r\nexceptional talent.” The inclination to intellectual occupation is\r\ndistinctly greater among homosexuals than the inclination to bodily\r\nwork. Associated with this is the ambition to distinguish themselves\r\nmentally above those by whom they are surrounded. Hirschfeld’s assertion\r\nthat homosexuals belonging to the lower classes exhibit intellectual\r\npredominance over their environment, I am able emphatically to confirm,\r\nafter frequent conversations with homosexual workmen and menservants.\r\nThe peculiarity of their congenital tendencies has here early given rise\r\nto a certain intellectual profundity, has early taught these men to\r\n=reflect= about the world and about human existence. Every homosexual is\r\na philosopher for himself. Most heterosexuals, especially those of the\r\nlower classes, never arrive at thinking so much about themselves and\r\nabout their relations to the external world, as is a matter of course\r\namong homosexuals. The =imaginative=, the =dreamy=, is much more\r\npredominant in the homosexual than a crude sense of reality. This\r\nexpresses itself particularly in his love, which far less frequently and\r\nexclusively than among the heterosexual takes the form of a gross and\r\nmaterial sensuality. On the contrary, it permits us to recognize the\r\ninward need for tenderness and delicacy, for a peculiar ideal colouring.\r\nGoethe has contrasted this latter with the more sensual heterosexual\r\nlove; he speaks of the\r\n\r\n  “remarkable phenomenon of the love of men for each other. Let it be\r\n  admitted that this love is seldom pushed to the highest degree of\r\n  sensuality, but rather occupies the intermediate region between\r\n  inclination and passion. I am able to say that I have seen with my own\r\n  eyes the most beautiful manifestations of this love, such as we have\r\n  handed down to us from the days of Greek antiquity; and as an\r\n  observant student of human nature I was able to observe the\r\n  intellectual and moral elements of this love.”[510]\r\n\r\nThe ideal conception of Platonic--that is, of homosexual--love was a\r\nnon-sensual, assexual love. The psychical element also plays an\r\nimportant part in modern uranism--a part overlooked or underestimated,\r\nwhereas the sensual side is exaggerated.\r\n\r\nHomosexuality as an anthropological phenomenon is diffused throughout\r\nall classes of the population. We find it among workmen just as much as\r\namong aristocrats, princely personalities, and intellectual heroes.\r\nPhysicians, lawyers, theologians, philosophers, merchants, artists,\r\netc., all contribute their contingents to uranism. If the\r\nextraordinarily frequent occurrence of homosexuality in the highest\r\nclasses of society, especially in the leaders of the aristocracy, may\r\npossibly be brought into relationship with the processes of\r\n“degeneration,” still, on the other hand, numerous homosexuals are\r\nderived from healthy families, such as have not transmitted hereditary\r\ntaint through a long series of ancestors. Recently G. Merzbach[511] has\r\nstudied the relationship between homosexuality and the choice of a\r\nprofession, and has proved that this choice is usually a consequence of\r\nthe natural tendency. Thus we find an especially large number of\r\nhomosexuals engaged in the production of ready-made clothing and in\r\nother manufacturing trades; others become music-hall comedians playing\r\nwomen’s parts, actors, dancers. Actors and singers appearing on the\r\nstage as women are to a large extent original homosexuals.[512] Among\r\nhairdressers and waiters we find also a relatively large number of\r\nurnings.\r\n\r\nAs regards the =diffusion= of homosexuality, the data obtainable up to\r\nthe most recent times have been extremely contradictory. The first exact\r\ninformation is to be found in the work of a physician, published under\r\nthe name of M. Kertbeny,[513] on “§ 143 of the Prussian Criminal Code of\r\nApril 14, 1851, and its Continuance as § 152 in the Proposal for a\r\nCriminal Code for the North German Bund” (Leipzig, 1869). The author\r\nenumerates in Berlin 10,000 homosexuals among 700,000 inhabitants (equal\r\nto 1·425 %). A patient of von Krafft-Ebing, living in a town of 13,000\r\ninhabitants, was acquainted with 14 urnings; and in another town of\r\n60,000 he knew of at least 80. Many other equally uncertain estimates\r\nare recorded by Magnus Hirschfeld. They vary between 2 % and\r\n0·1 %--vary, that is to say, within very wide limits. In view,\r\ntherefore, of the importance of the exact determination of the number of\r\nhomosexuals, which I myself had earlier declared to be desirable, we owe\r\ngreat thanks to Magnus Hirschfeld for having made an attempt[514] to\r\nobtain some exact data regarding this matter. He deduces from a\r\ncompilation of thirty test investigations (reports regarding homosexuals\r\nin various classes of the population), and by means of an inquiry made\r\nwith sealed letters, that the proportion of male homosexuals to the\r\npopulation =is about= 1·5 %. That is a very much =greater= percentage\r\nthan has hitherto been assumed to exist. Formerly I doubted the accuracy\r\nof this figure, but since numerous respected, honourable, well-behaved\r\npersons, of whom I had not suspected it, have assured me that they have\r\nbeen homosexual since childhood, I have no longer any doubt regarding\r\nthe approximate accuracy of Hirschfeld’s statistics. The enquiry made by\r\nDr. von Römer in Amsterdam gave similar results, for he found the\r\nproportion of homosexuals to be 1·9 %. A third enquiry made by\r\nHirschfeld among the metal-workers of Berlin gave a proportion of 1·1 %.\r\n\r\n=Normal heterosexual= love was reported in about 94 to 96 % of the three\r\ninquiries.\r\n\r\n  “An imposing recognition of the love of man for woman, a powerful\r\n  manifestation of the provision for the preservation of the species,\r\n  and a contradiction to the fear that the uranian element in the\r\n  population could ever seriously impair the well-being of the great\r\n  majority” (Hirschfeld).\r\n\r\nAs “=bisexual=”--that is, as exhibiting tendencies towards both\r\nsexes--the average of the three enquiries reported 3·9 %, of whom,\r\nhowever, 0·8 % were mainly homosexual.\r\n\r\nThe total number of the purely and mainly homosexual was thus 2·2 %.\r\nHence, according to the results of the last census of 1900, in the total\r\npopulation of the German Empire, numbering 56,367,178, there would be\r\nabout 1,200,000 =homosexuals=; whilst of the population of Berlin,\r\nnumbering 2,500,000, 56,000 would be homosexual.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of the scientific and social study of homosexuality, it\r\nis urgently necessary that these statistical investigations should be\r\npursued, for if it should appear that the above estimates really apply\r\nto the whole Empire--which I do not feel justified in assuming without\r\nfurther evidence, since it is naturally possible that Berlin might\r\ncontain a relatively greater number of homosexuals--uranism would, in\r\nfact, have a greater social importance than it has hitherto been assumed\r\nto possess. In any case, the number of urnings is large enough to make\r\nthem appear a remarkable anthropological variety of our race.\r\n\r\nThe truth of this assertion is supported by the fact of the ubiquitous\r\ndiffusion of uranism in time and space. In addition to homosexuality as\r\na popular custom, genuine homosexuality also played a part in antiquity;\r\nand F. Karsch[515] has proved in an admirable book its occurrence among\r\nall savage races, although unquestionably numerous cases of non-genuine\r\nhomosexuality must have been included. That homosexuality is in no\r\nway a sign of “degeneration” is proved also by the fact that it is\r\nmore widely diffused among the still thoroughly vigorous Germans and\r\nAnglo-Saxons than it is among the Latin peoples. It is especially\r\nfrequent in the German Ostsee provinces. It existed among the ancient\r\nScandinavians.[516] Recently F. Karsch has announced the publication of\r\nethnological researches on homosexuality, the first volume of which\r\nhas already been issued, under the title “Homosexual Life among\r\nthe Inhabitants of Eastern Asia: the Chinese, the Japanese, and\r\nthe Koreans”[517] (Munich, 1906). In the preface he states expressly\r\nthat he treats not only of original homosexuality, but also of\r\nartificially produced or acquired homosexuality--that which I call\r\n“pseudo-homosexuality.”\r\n\r\nMy earlier view, that true homosexuality is rare among the =Jews=, I\r\nfind it necessary to revise, for recently I have made the acquaintance\r\nof numerous Jewish homosexuals.\r\n\r\nFor the =earlier history and literature of homosexuality= the most\r\nimportant, and, in fact, nearly exhaustive, sources are the article\r\n“Pæderasty,” by Meier, in Ersch and Gruber’s “General Encyclopædia,”\r\nsection iii., part 9, pp. 149-189 (Leipzig, 1837); Rosenbaum’s “History\r\nof Syphilis in Antiquity,” pp. 119-227[518] (Halle, 1893); and, finally,\r\nthe writings of the earliest German student of homosexuality, containing\r\nnumerous interesting data, the Hanoverian official Karl Heinrich\r\nUlrichs,[519] who, under the pseudonym “Numa Numantius,” published\r\nnumerous works devoted to the emancipation of homosexuals, and to the\r\nproof of the congenital nature of homosexuality. The general title of\r\nthese works is “Anthropological Studies on the Sexual Love of Man for\r\nMan.” They were published under various peculiar separate titles, such\r\nas: “Vindex” (Leipzig, 1864); “Inclusa” (Leipzig, 1864); “Vindicta”\r\n(Leipzig, 1865); “Formatrix” (Leipzig, 1865); “Ara Spei” (Leipzig,\r\n1865); “Gladius Furens” (Kassel, 1868); “Memnon” (Schleiz, 1868);\r\n“Incubus” (Leipzig, 1869); “Argonauticus” (Leipzig, 1869); “Araxes”\r\n(Schleiz, 1870); “Uranus” (Leipzig, 1870); “Kritische Pfeile”\r\n(Stuttgart, 1879). In addition, Ulrichs, whose lifetime extended from\r\n1825 to 1895, published uranian poetry under the title of “Auf Bienchens\r\nFlügeln” (“On the Wings of the Bee”); Leipzig, 1875. These writings,\r\nmost of which are very rare in their original editions (although many\r\nwere reprinted in the year 1898), contained a number of new points of\r\nview for the consideration of homosexuality, which have been recognized\r\nas sound by recent investigators.\r\n\r\nImportant contributions to the knowledge of homosexuality are afforded\r\nus by the studies of the life and works of celebrated and intellectually\r\ndistinguished urnings. As unquestionably homosexual we may mention the\r\npoet Platen,[520] Michael Angelo,[521] Heinrich Hössli,[522] Heinrich\r\nBulthaupt,[523] Johannes von Müller (the historian),[524] King Henry\r\nIII. of France,[525] the musician Franz von Holstein,[526] Peter\r\nTschaikowsky,[527] the authors Count Emmerich von Stadion and Emil Mario\r\nVacano,[528] Duke August von Gotha,[529] George Eekhoud,[530] and the\r\nBelgian sculptor Jérôme Duquesnoy (1602-1654).[531] The following\r\ncelebrated persons have also been regarded as urnings, but, as it\r\nappears to me, on insufficient proofs: Frederick the Great; J. J.\r\nWinkelmann, who at most was bisexual, since we know of passionate\r\nletters written by him to a woman; and Alexander von Sternberg,[532] of\r\nwhom the same is true; the reformers Beza[533] and Calvin,[534] who have\r\nunquestionably been wrongfully accused; and finally Byron and\r\nGrillparzer,[535] without troubling to enumerate hypotheses utterly\r\nwithout foundation. It is unquestionably a fact that a large number of\r\nintellectually prominent men were genuine homosexuals, and that their\r\nabnormal congenital tendencies did not prevent their doing important\r\nwork in other spheres of activity. But this happened =notwithstanding=,\r\nand =not=, as many talented apologists wish to prove, =because of= their\r\nuranism.\r\n\r\nWhen we pass to consider the =activity= of homosexual love, we find that\r\nhomosexuals may, and actually do, love either other homosexual or\r\nheterosexual individuals. According to the account given by Meisner\r\n(“Uranism,” pp. 19, 20), the amatory ideal of most homosexual men is a\r\nheterosexual man, and intercourse between two urnings is, properly\r\nspeaking, only a matter of necessity. But by several homosexuals with\r\nwhom I discussed the matter this view was declared to be erroneous; in\r\nthe majority of cases the attraction between two homosexuals plays the\r\nprincipal rôle. Ulrichs endeavoured to provide a theoretical\r\njustification for the sexual relationship between two homosexuals, and\r\nmaintained (_cf._, for example, “Inclusa,” pp. 64, 65) that Nature\r\ndestined the heterosexual, or “dioning,” as he calls them, by no means\r\nfor woman alone, but also for the urning, for the “fulfilment of the\r\nsexual purposes of Nature, not directed towards reproduction.” According\r\nto Hirschfeld (“Urnings,” pp. 22, 23), it is unquestionable that, whilst\r\nmany homosexuals greatly prefer to associate with those who also feel in\r\na uranian manner, and whilst to many also it is a matter of indifference\r\nwhether or not those with whom they have sexual relations are themselves\r\nendowed with contrary sexuality, quite a number of urnings feel\r\nattracted =exclusively= to normal, sexually powerful natures. As a rule,\r\nit is not difficult for homosexuals to gratify their inclinations in\r\nintercourse with heterosexual individuals. A middle-aged urning informed\r\nme that young heterosexual men =almost always= acceded in this matter\r\nto the expressed wish of homosexuals--in the first place from simple\r\ncuriosity, and in the second place by no means rarely from sexual\r\nexcitement. Indeed, according to this authority, effeminate homosexual\r\nmen often produce in powerfully sensual heterosexual men the impression\r\nof femininity, and are seduced by the latter to mutual masturbation,\r\nespecially in a state of alcoholic intoxication. Not infrequently does\r\nit happen--a striking example having come to my knowledge--that a young\r\nheterosexual has a love intimacy with a girl, and yet occasionally, when\r\nhe is for any reason unable to have sexual intercourse with her, he\r\n=very willingly= transfers his affections to a homosexual man. Male\r\nprostitutes are also, to a large extent, heterosexual men who give\r\nthemselves to homosexuals for pecuniary reward. Occasionally, moreover,\r\nheterosexual men mistake very effeminate urnings going about in women’s\r\nclothing for genuine women, and have intercourse with them in this\r\nbelief--a belief which these latter are clever enough to keep up until\r\nthe last possible moment.\r\n\r\nPassing now to the consideration of the special circumstances of sexual\r\nattraction, we find that the true love of boys,[536] or rather the love\r\nof children (=pædophilia=), is rare in homosexuals. The age chiefly\r\npreferred is that between seventeen and twenty-five years, alike by\r\nmature homosexual men and by old men. On the other hand, it =is by no\r\nmeans an exceptional phenomenon= for youths, or even mature men, to feel\r\nattracted exclusively by elderly men (the so-called “=gerontophilia=”).\r\nThere exists also a heterosexual “gerontophilia”--that is to say,\r\nabnormal love exhibited by young men for old women, or by young women\r\nfor old men. Thus Féré reports (“Note sur une Anomalie de l’Instinct\r\nSexuel: Gerontophilie,” published in the _Journal de Neurologie_, 1905)\r\nthe case of a man twenty-seven years of age who was sexually attracted\r\nonly by white-haired, elderly women. He referred this to an impression\r\nreceived in very early youth. When four years old he slept in the same\r\nbed with an elderly lady, a family friend, who was visiting the house,\r\nand he then for the first time experienced sexual excitement. He had a\r\ndislike to young girls and young married women. A white-haired elderly\r\nwoman whom he loved dyed her hair light brown, whereupon he ceased to\r\ncare for her. Further, effeminate urnings prefer virile homosexuals;\r\nwhereas many of these latter have a great dislike to effeminates and to\r\nmen in women’s clothing--to those male “women” who adopt by preference\r\nfeminine nicknames, such as Louisa instead of Louis, Georgina instead of\r\nGeorge, and who speak to one another as “sister,” just as the Roman\r\nEmperor Heliogabalus wished to be addressed as “mistress” instead of\r\n“lord.” Many urnings love beardless men; others love men with a\r\nmoustache or a full beard; many homosexuals are fascinated by\r\nbright-coloured cloth, just as women are. Moreover, every possible\r\nindividual detail may here have an attractive force, just as is the case\r\nwith heterosexual love (the hair, the stature, the gait, the eyes, the\r\nintelligence, and the character).\r\n\r\nIdeal love and the gratification of the grossest sensuality are also the\r\ntwo poles between which the =amatory manifestations= of male homosexuals\r\noscillate. Many confine themselves to simple contacts, caresses, kisses\r\nand embraces. Most frequently sexual gratification is obtained by mutual\r\nmasturbation. The idea that the non-homosexual especially associates\r\nwith the word “pæderasty” is “pædication”[537]--that is, _immissio\r\nmembri in anum_. This sexual act is, however, far less frequent than it\r\nis commonly assumed to be by heterosexuals. According to Magnus\r\nHirschfeld, it occurs only in 8 %, according to G. Merzbach only in 6 %,\r\nof all cases of intercourse between male homosexuals. In an essay on\r\npædication which I possess, written by a homosexual, it is represented\r\nas much commoner, and as “the most natural and least harmful means of\r\ngratification.” According to a verbal communication made to me, the\r\nauthor of this essay knew of one hundred cases of pædication in which no\r\nharm had resulted. Frequently _coitus inter femora_ takes the place of\r\npædication; still more frequently “fellation,” or _coitus in os_, and\r\nthe widely diffused “tongue kiss.”[538] Other perverse manifestations of\r\nthe homosexual impulse also occur, such as anilinctus, fetichism,\r\nmasochism, sadism, exhibitionism, etc., just as they occur in\r\nheterosexual individuals.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the relations of true homosexuals to women, generally\r\nspeaking they =loathe sexual intercourse= with woman, but they do not\r\ndislike woman herself. Women, on the contrary, are greatly liked by most\r\nhomosexuals; effeminate urnings more especially gladly seek their\r\nsociety, in order to gossip with them about all kinds of feminine\r\nbelongings. =Marriages= are often contracted by homosexuals who are\r\nreally ignorant as to their own condition, or who hope to conceal it\r\nfrom the world, or simply for pecuniary considerations. They result most\r\nunhappily if the wife has need of love, and understands the real nature\r\nof the case; or, again, if she becomes jealous of her husband’s male\r\nlovers; but when the wife is frigid, they may turn out quite happily.\r\nThey are, however, always very unnatural. Hirschfeld[539] has thoroughly\r\ndiscussed the question of the marriage of homosexuals, and has also\r\nalluded to the occasional marriages between homosexual men and\r\nhomosexual women. The fact proved by him that among homosexuals the\r\nimpulse towards the preservation of the species is almost entirely\r\nwanting--not more than 3 % have the wish to possess children--shows how\r\nlittle fitted they are for the purposes of marriage.\r\n\r\nThe above-described sexual relationships may be illustrated by a few\r\noriginal reports taken from the autobiographies of homosexuals. For\r\nexample, a homosexual man, twenty-seven years of age, writes:\r\n\r\n  “When I was young, from four to six years of age, I loved to look at\r\n  the male generative organs, without knowing why they attracted me. I\r\n  liked to look at sculpture and pictures representing male nudity. I\r\n  detest woman’s work and the fashions of the day: a simple costume\r\n  suffices for me. I learned the ‘great secret of the world’ when I was\r\n  twelve years old, but woman had no interest for me, and I was always\r\n  asking little boys of from ten to fourteen years of age to show me\r\n  their private parts. I commenced to have carnal intercourse with boys\r\n  (aged eighteen to twenty-four) when I was myself twenty-four. Only\r\n  _coitus inter femora_, face to face, never from behind. I always\r\n  assume the active rôle. A young man from eighteen to twenty-four years\r\n  of age is to me like a woman. A woman is to me a thing (!), not so a\r\n  man. Perhaps it is original, odd for our time; but what is to be done?\r\n  Woman is a machine for producing children, and nothing more. I am not\r\n  married, and never shall marry.”\r\n\r\nAnother homosexual writes:\r\n\r\n  “I was about five years old when, walking with a nursemaid in the\r\n  pleasure gardens, I saw a man masturbating. Although I did not know\r\n  what he was doing, the picture busied my imagination for many years.\r\n  In my dreams, up to the age of fourteen years, the thought of living\r\n  together with a companion of the same age as myself played the\r\n  principal part. At the age of thirteen I fell in love with a\r\n  schoolfellow, who was, however, but little inclined towards me. What\r\n  perhaps especially interested me in him was that he brought sexual\r\n  enlightenment to our class. Through moving to another town I lost\r\n  sight of him. Although at that time I knew nothing of the real sexual\r\n  life, still I sought for objects which excited my sensuality.\r\n\r\n  “An unknown man of about thirty-five years of age seduced me, and\r\n  practised pæderasty with me on the first occasion that he met me. I\r\n  felt that there was something altogether wrong about this practice,\r\n  but was too weak to withdraw myself from his influence. After about\r\n  three months he disappeared. Now also I knew what masturbation was,\r\n  for in the school this practice was common.\r\n\r\n  “At the age of eighteen I left the school, and as in my comrades the\r\n  impulse towards women now showed itself, I, for my part, felt all the\r\n  more how everything directed me towards man. I often endeavoured, in\r\n  obedience to the urging of my friends, to form relationships with\r\n  women of the half-world, but this always filled me with the greatest\r\n  horror and repugnance. To me it is a dreadful feeling when I notice\r\n  that a woman is interested in me. All the more, on the other hand, did\r\n  the male sex interest me. When I love a man I do not think (only) of\r\n  sexual union, but I try to read in him what I am myself prepared to\r\n  give: a sole interest, faithfulness, unselfish surrender. If I love a\r\n  man, anyone else is nothing to me.\r\n\r\n  “Every man of standing of twenty to forty years of age is interesting\r\n  to me--every one who is not positively repulsive--but most of all\r\n  anyone who possesses a distinguished psyche. In isolated cases\r\n  sympathy has also led me to love.\r\n\r\n  “The kiss is of the highest importance to me, and precisely because I\r\n  regard love as created only for a holy purpose, so that human beings\r\n  may be mutually ennobled and morally advanced by this passion, it has\r\n  always been repulsive to me to observe how men flirt with one another,\r\n  just as is the case with heterosexuals. For this reason I am\r\n  disinclined to visit places of general resort--such as, for example,\r\n  the Casino of Dresden, where all kinds of people come together. I have\r\n  met hardly any other urning who shares my sentiments in this respect.”\r\n\r\nA homosexual physician, thirty-two years of age, gives the following\r\naccount of his sexuality:\r\n\r\n  “I cannot tell you at what age sexual inclinations first appeared in\r\n  me. My sexual impulse is directed towards males. Before and during the\r\n  time of puberty the impulse was quite indeterminate. I believe that at\r\n  this time I even cherished the idea of some day carrying out\r\n  intercourse with a girl. But this was not love; it was a purely\r\n  physical desire. The spiritual side of the impulse was at this time\r\n  completely wanting. The sexual impulse now extends only towards young\r\n  men. I have hitherto had sexual intercourse neither with males nor\r\n  with females, but I believe that I should be competent for the normal\r\n  sexual act. This act, however, would give me no pleasure; it would be\r\n  nothing more than masturbation. I feel complete indifference towards\r\n  the female sex, but I do not feel hatred or disgust. Sexual\r\n  dreams[540] relate always to persons of the same sex. On the stage,\r\n  in the circus, it is always the men who interest me more than the\r\n  women. In addition, I admire celebrated actresses and female singers,\r\n  but my interest in them is purely artistic. From this standpoint also\r\n  I am fully able to do justice to the beauty of young women, and have\r\n  often wished to paint a girl, but this interest is always that of a\r\n  painter--the colour of the hair, the complexion, interesting features.\r\n  Social intercourse with persons of the other sex is quite\r\n  unrestrained. The sense of shame I feel more in regard to women, but\r\n  still I have also a strong sense of shame with regard to men. I always\r\n  have a great difficulty to overcome when I have to take off my clothes\r\n  in the presence of other men, and it is also very difficult to me to\r\n  urinate when other men are present.\r\n\r\n  “My love exists only towards youths from the ages of seventeen to\r\n  twenty-four, or, to speak more strictly, towards youths at the time of\r\n  puberty. One of these of whom I am fond is sixteen years of age, but\r\n  sexually he is completely mature, so that every one imagines him to be\r\n  twenty.\r\n\r\n  “The direction of my sexual impulse has first become perfectly clear\r\n  to me since reading the _Annual for Sexual Intermediate Stages_. I was\r\n  already fully aware of the fact that young men were especially\r\n  interesting to me, but had not previously understood that this\r\n  interest was of a sexual nature. I had, indeed, heard of\r\n  pæderasty--the case of Krupp and others--but I imagined that these\r\n  individuals had developed such a tendency in consequence of satiety.\r\n  ‘You,’ I said to myself, ‘are purer and nobler in sentiment. Pæderasty\r\n  is loathsome to you; no human being will ever understand you.’\r\n\r\n  “Every young man at the age of puberty awakens in me a certain sexual\r\n  interest. This is especially the case when they are slender and wiry\r\n  in build, not fat, with well-developed, but not excessively powerful,\r\n  muscles, with gentle and modest character. Roughness always suffices\r\n  to destroy completely the commencement of inclination. Sturdy, plump\r\n  youths, and those with an excessive development of fat under the skin,\r\n  or with a wide, feminine aspect of the buttocks, leave me\r\n  comparatively cold. The youthful forms embodied in Grecian sculpture\r\n  are my ideal type. It is indispensable that they should be beardless,\r\n  or at most have the merest beginnings of a beard. A youth with a heavy\r\n  moustache leaves me cold; he is too masculine for me. Intellectual\r\n  culture plays no part in the attraction; modesty and gentleness are\r\n  necessary to render an intimate relationship possible. I find no\r\n  preference for any particular profession. I have, indeed, pedagogic\r\n  inclinations, but these appear to me to play no part in producing\r\n  attraction, but come into action only later. One whom one loves is one\r\n  in whom one would be glad to produce spiritual perfection. The\r\n  attraction depends, in the first place, upon beauty of the body;\r\n  beauty of the face is only of secondary importance. Smell has no\r\n  influence upon the attraction.”\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that this writer, now thirty-two years of age, has\r\nhitherto had no experience of sexual intercourse, either heterosexual\r\nor homosexual. This is characteristic. Homosexuals in general, in\r\ncontrast to heterosexuals, often proceed =at a comparatively late age=\r\nto actual experience of their sexual impulse in action. He goes on to\r\ndescribe the first beginnings of his love for a beautiful youth,\r\neighteen years of age. He writes:\r\n\r\n  “My eyes watched every movement of the body, which continually\r\n  displayed new beauties. I should have loved to fall upon his neck and\r\n  kiss him. For sexual intercourse he appeared to me too pure, too\r\n  noble; I should rather have lain before him in the dust and prayed to\r\n  his beauty. I felt that I should have been a poet in order to be able\r\n  to clothe in the right words this delicate and holy sentiment. And I\r\n  must shut this all up within myself, must remain outwardly cold. It\r\n  was enough to drive me to madness! Have compassion on us, and allow us\r\n  at least an embrace, a kiss. That certainly can do no one any harm,\r\n  and for me it would be a good action. The distressing tension which\r\n  tortures us to death would be for the time relaxed. I always have a\r\n  feeling that the process of sexual attraction must be of an electrical\r\n  nature. I seem to myself to be charged with electricity, the tension\r\n  increasing up to the highest point when the beloved is near me, and a\r\n  prolonged contact or a stroking with the hand already suffices to\r\n  bring about a certain calming of the nerves. The tension is to some\r\n  degree diminished. The various components of sexual enjoyment appear\r\n  to be developed in human beings with very different strength. In this\r\n  way it is explicable that in one person the odour of the loved one, in\r\n  another the changing tones of the voice, in a third the taste of the\r\n  kiss (the tongue kiss), is most stimulating. It is, indeed, even\r\n  conceivable that there exists a purely mental sexual enjoyment, and\r\n  that to some individuals merely to look at the beloved person, or to\r\n  read a letter from him, suffices.\r\n\r\n  “Sexual intercourse had hitherto never been practised, but I can\r\n  asseverate that the mode of my desire is rather feminine. It would be\r\n  my ideal if the loved one should feel sexual ardour for me; I should\r\n  be a willing sacrifice. I should like to possess feminine sexual\r\n  organs, in order to appear desirable to the loved one.\r\n\r\n  “I have battled powerfully against my nature, and have felt very\r\n  unhappy. I regard myself as physically and mentally healthy. I have\r\n  received at birth a double nature (alas! two souls dwell within my\r\n  breast). My body is that of a man, my soul rather that of a woman;\r\n  hence the conflict, hence my sexual desires, considered outwardly and\r\n  only from the physical point of view, are contrary to nature. Alas! my\r\n  soul can be seen by no one.\r\n\r\n  “Why do I only love a young man? Because he in ideal fashion enlarges\r\n  my nature. My sexual sensibility is mainly feminine, and is directed,\r\n  therefore, towards the masculine, and more especially towards the\r\n  masculine in the time of youth, because the feminine sensibility in my\r\n  nature is damped by a small masculine note. The effeminate urning\r\n  probably loves the complete man as the best complement of his own\r\n  nature. The slightly masculine note of my own sexual perception\r\n  demands also in the man whom I love a slight feminine note, such as we\r\n  find in the youth. He has, in fact, something feminine in\r\n  him--beardlessness, no immoderate strength of the muscular system, a\r\n  gentle disposition, receptive emotions--and yet he is masculine and\r\n  sexually mature. Sexual maturity is a necessary part of every love.\r\n  The young man, therefore, is the ideal conception of my nature. My\r\n  love is as great, as holy, and as pure, as heterosexual love; it is\r\n  capable of self-sacrifice. Believe me, for a loved one who fully\r\n  understood me in every respect, I would gladly go to my death.\r\n\r\n  “Ah! how painful it is to us when we are regarded as debauchees or as\r\n  sick persons!”\r\n\r\nI must say that the above account, given to me by a much respected\r\nmedical colleague, one whose nature is characterized alike by\r\nintellectual power and ideal sensibility, has made the deepest\r\nimpression upon me, and has been an important influence in confirming my\r\nviews regarding the nature of original homosexuality. Similar oral\r\ncommunications have been received by me from other physicians who have\r\nbeen homosexual from childhood onwards, one a neurologist and the other\r\nan alienist, and I attribute the greatest importance to the account\r\ngiven by this colleague of mine, who has a =twofold= understanding of\r\nthe matter in question--as physician and as homosexual. It is also\r\nimportant to note that uranian physicians declare the majority of\r\nhomosexuals to be physically and mentally healthy, a fact which I myself\r\nhad not previously doubted, and that they contest the general validity\r\nof the degeneration theory.\r\n\r\nWhilst in the smaller provincial towns and in the country homosexuals\r\nare for the most part thrust back into themselves, compelled to conceal\r\ntheir nature, or at most able to communicate only with isolated\r\nindividuals of like nature with themselves, in the larger towns from\r\nearly days the homosexuals have been able to get into touch with one\r\nanother. Certain meeting-places--places of rendezvous for urnings\r\nonly--have been formed; in certain =streets= and =squares= there have\r\nbeen formed urning-clubs, boarding-houses, and restaurants, and even\r\nurning-balls, while certain health resorts are to a degree monopolized\r\nby them. Moreover, the individual social groups of the homosexuals form\r\nunions. Thus, for example, Hirschfeld[541] reports the existence of an\r\nevening association consisting exclusively of homosexual princes,\r\ncounts, and barons. Such pæderastic meeting-places and unions existed in\r\nthe eighteenth century in Paris. From this time until about 1840 certain\r\ndark lateral alleys of the Champs Elysées, the thickets from the Place\r\nde la Concorde to the Allée des Veuves, between the Grand Avenue des\r\nChamps Elysées and the Cour de la Reine, served from the commencement\r\nof twilight for the rendezvous of homosexuals, not simply as a place of\r\nmasculine prostitution, but as a meeting-place of urnings in general,\r\nwho here in the dark sought and found love. The central point of this\r\nevening activity was the Allée des Veuves (now known as the Avenue\r\nMontaigne), the “Widow’s Alley”--“widow” was at that time the term used\r\nto denote the passive pæderast. This region of the Champs Elysées was to\r\na certain extent monopolized by the homosexuals. They would not tolerate\r\nhere the presence of any heterosexuals; they closed the entrances with\r\ncords, and placed guards at the openings of the alleys, who demanded a\r\npass-word from every comer. Even the police did not venture into this\r\ndark region.\r\n\r\n  “Victor Hugo, who in the year 1831 lived in the Rue Jean Goujon in\r\n  this neighbourhood, often accompanied his friends who had been\r\n  visiting him part of the way home at a late hour of the night. They\r\n  walked in groups, talking of literature and art as far as the Place de\r\n  la Concorde. There the celebrated poet parted from his guests and\r\n  returned alone homewards, composing new verses by the way. He often\r\n  noticed individuals who, as he passed the entrance to the Rue des\r\n  Veuves, watched him from afar off without speaking to him. He could\r\n  not believe that these people were thieves, and asked himself what\r\n  could be the cause of their always waiting in this lonely place; but\r\n  notwithstanding the frequent occurrence of these scenes, he made no\r\n  further inquiry into the matter. But once in the midst of his poetical\r\n  reverie he was disturbed by a man who stepped forward from the\r\n  darkness of a thicket, and with a polite greeting said to him: ‘Sir,\r\n  we beg you not to wait any longer in this place. We know who you are,\r\n  and we should not wish that any one of us who does not know you should\r\n  cause you any uneasiness.’ ‘What are you doing there, then?’ answered\r\n  Victor Hugo. ‘Every evening I see people walking about here, and\r\n  disappearing among the trees.’ ‘Don’t concern yourself about it, sir,’\r\n  was the brisk answer; ‘we disturb no one and do no one any harm, but\r\n  we shall not permit anyone to disturb us or to do us any harm; =we are\r\n  here in our own grounds=.’ Victor Hugo understood, bowed, and pursued\r\n  his way. As on another evening, walking with his friends, he wished to\r\n  pass through another alley running parallel to the Allée des Veuves,\r\n  he found that this was closed by a number of chairs, which were\r\n  fastened together with cords. ‘There is no thoroughfare,’ called out a\r\n  threatening voice; but another, speaking more quietly, added: ‘We beg\r\n  Monsieur Victor Hugo on this occasion to pass along the other side of\r\n  the Avenue des Champs Elysées.’”[542]\r\n\r\nDuring the Second Empire the Allée des Veuves maintained its former\r\nposition as a place of rendezvous for homosexuals. An urnings’ club, the\r\nmembers of which belonged to the highest classes of society, being\r\npersons of the Imperial Court, senators, great financiers, etc., had\r\ntheir meeting-place in a beautifully furnished hotel in the Allée des\r\nVeuves, in which soldiers of the Empress’s bodyguard (Dragons de\r\nl’Impératrice) and of the Hundred Guard of the Emperor served, in return\r\nfor valuable presents, as the beloved of the various distinguished\r\nurnings, for which function the term “faire l’Impératrice” came into\r\nuse. In the hotel there also lived from time to time transient unknown\r\npersons, who were only admitted after showing a kind of medal bearing a\r\nsecret inscription. When the police made an examination of the hotel,\r\nthey found a number of women’s dresses and similar articles, such as\r\nthose which the Empress Eugénie was accustomed to wear on festival\r\noccasions. Numerous letters were also discovered which had been\r\nexchanged by the members of the club and their favourites of the Hundred\r\nGuard or of the Empress’s guard. A report was made to the Emperor of the\r\nresults of the examination of this house. When he saw that persons of\r\nthe highest position, and bearing most celebrated names, were involved\r\nin the affair, he at once ordered that the matter should be dismissed,\r\nand said to the Procureur-General: “We must spare our people and our\r\ncountry from such a scandal, which would do no one any good, and would\r\ndo a great deal of harm.” In fact, almost no details of this affair\r\nbecame public.[543] Tardieu gave an account of another urnings’ club of\r\nthe Second Empire, where there were concealed closets, on the walls of\r\nwhich erotic pictures were displayed. The manner in which the urnings\r\nmade acquaintance with homosexuals is shown in a police report of July\r\n16, 1864, in which the conduct of a literary homosexual, “un vieux\r\nmonsieur fort bien et puissamment riche,” is described in the following\r\nterms:\r\n\r\n  “He enters the Café Truffaut, sees a young soldier who pleases him. By\r\n  the intermediation of the waiter he makes an appointment, and departs\r\n  without waiting for an answer. If the soldier agrees, he goes to the\r\n  appointed place of meeting, and never goes alone, because Father\r\n  C----n (the elderly urning) is well known. As soon as the two have\r\n  met, other soldiers make their appearance, beat the old man, and\r\n  compel him to give them all the money which he has about him. He does\r\n  this willingly, and without ceasing prays for pardon. When he has not\r\n  a single sou left, and when he has also given up his watch, he goes\r\n  away weeping, and continually repeating the words, ‘What a miserable\r\n  man I am!’”\r\n\r\nThis elderly urning was manifestly also a masochist, and therefore a\r\nvery suitable victim of blackmailers, whom we here see at their work. In\r\nthe police report to which we have already referred homosexual orgies\r\nare also described, the participants in which assumed women’s names and\r\npractised mutual masturbation and fellation, and also carried out\r\nobscene practices with a bitch. When Oscar Metenier in his book “Vertus\r\net Vices Allemands” (Paris, 1904) states that Berlin has a monopoly in\r\nthe matter of urnings’ balls, which, in his opinion, were not possible\r\nin Paris, he is unquestionably wrong as regards the time of the Second\r\nEmpire. In this police report two typical urnings’ balls are mentioned.\r\nOne of these took place in a house in the Place de la Madeleine,\r\nbelonging to E. D., a man of business, who gave the ball on January 2,\r\n1864. The second urnings’ ball was given by the Vicomte de M. in the\r\nPavilion Rohan, Rue de Rivoli, on January 16, 1864, at which at least\r\n150 men, many of them in woman’s clothing, took part. In many cases the\r\nappearance was so deceptive that even those who had invited the guests\r\nwere not always able to determine the sex with certainty.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtless true that there is no other town in which there are so\r\nmany social unions of homosexuals as there are in Berlin. Hirschfeld\r\nrecords--in addition to private parties--dinners, suppers, evening\r\nparties, five o’clock teas, picnics, dances, and summer festivals of\r\nhomosexuals, which are arranged every winter by urnings, and by female\r\nhomosexuals or their friends. Moreover, the male and female homosexuals\r\nmeet in certain restaurants, cafés, eating-houses, and public-houses\r\nfrequented only by themselves.[544]\r\n\r\nSuch localities exclusively for the use of urnings exist in Berlin to\r\nthe number of eighteen to twenty. There are also social literary unions,\r\nsuch as the club “Lohengrin,” the antifeministic “Gesellschaft der\r\nEigenen,” the “Platen-Gemeinschaft,” etc. There are also cabarets\r\n(public-houses) for urnings. Hirschfeld, in his book “Berlin’s Third\r\nSex,” written in a popular style, but extremely valuable owing to the\r\nclearness of his descriptions, gives an exhaustive account of all these\r\ninstitutions for urnings, and for further details I may refer my readers\r\nto this interesting work, the authenticity of which I am able to confirm\r\nas the result of my own visits to the above-mentioned places of meeting\r\nfor urnings.[545]\r\n\r\nIn Paris there no longer exist places of entertainment frequented solely\r\nby urnings. In this respect they are replaced by certain Turkish baths,\r\nwhose patrons are almost without exception homosexuals--men whose age\r\nvaries from about twenty years upwards. In the industrial quarter, in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the Place de la République, there existed a few\r\nyears ago a Turkish bath, visited almost exclusively by young\r\nhomosexuals between the ages of fifteen and twenty years. On the great\r\nboulevard there is a bath of a very expensive character, visited only by\r\nwealthy homosexuals, frequented, among others, by a celebrated French\r\ncomposer.[546]\r\n\r\nA peculiar species of meeting-places for the urnings of Berlin is\r\nrepresented by the soldiers’ public-houses in the neighbourhood of the\r\nbarracks, where soldiers are met and treated by homosexuals, and where\r\narrangements are made for subsequent meetings. There also exists a\r\n“soldiers’ promenade,” where the soldiers walk up and down and offer\r\nthemselves to homosexuals. Athletes also enter freely into relationships\r\nwith homosexuals.\r\n\r\nUrnings’ balls are to-day especially characteristic of Berlin. Von\r\nKrafft-Ebing has described them in detail, and recently also Hirschfeld\r\nhas alluded to them in the above-mentioned work. I myself not long ago\r\nattended such a “men’s ball,” at which from eight hundred to a thousand\r\nhomosexuals were present, some in men’s clothing, some in women’s\r\nclothing, some in fancy dress. The homosexuals dressed as women could\r\nhave been distinguished from real women only by those in the secret.\r\nMore particularly do I recall an elegant sylph, who, on the arm of a\r\npartner, glided across the hall--“glided” is the correct expression.\r\nDuring the dance his delicate features were leaning on the shoulder of\r\nthe man, and he coquetted continually with ardent black eyes. I really\r\nbelieved this was a woman, but was assured that it was a male\r\nhairdresser. In the case of another urning dressed as a woman the\r\ndiagnosis was rendered easier by a well-developed moustache.\r\n\r\nThe seamy side of the relationships of homosexuals in public life is\r\nconstituted by the so-called “=male prostitution=,” which existed even\r\nin ancient times, and in our own day was especially well organized\r\nduring the Second Empire, as we learn from the details given by Tardieu.\r\nThe ranks of male prostitution are recruited partly from homosexual and\r\npartly from heterosexual men of the lower and more poverty-stricken\r\nclasses, who give themselves for payment to well-to-do urnings, and are\r\npractised in all the arts of elaborate coquetry (they use rouge, make a\r\ncoquettish display of male charms, etc.). These are the so-called\r\n“aunts.” In all large towns there exists what is called a “Strich”\r\n(promenade), where male prostitutes are accustomed to walk, in order to\r\nattract their clients. In Berlin the principal promenades are the\r\nFriedrichstrasse, the Passage,[547] and some of the walks in the\r\nTiergarten. Like female prostitution, so also male prostitution has its\r\n“=houses of accommodation=”; and in France there even existed, and still\r\nexist, typical “=male brothels=.” From 1820 to 1826 such a brothel was\r\nto be found in the Rue du Doyenne in Paris. In the neighbourhood of the\r\nLouvre the male inmates of this establishment were even subjected to\r\nregular medical examination, in order to protect their clients from\r\nvenereal infection. With the fall of twilight the visitors made their\r\nappearance, and were received by young effeminates.[548] Still worse was\r\nanother form of male prostitution, at the time of the Restoration, and\r\nin the earlier years of the reign of Louis Philippe--namely, the\r\nso-called _grande montre des culs_ in the Rue des Marais, where a number\r\nof male prostitutes displayed and offered their charms to the\r\nhomosexuals visiting the place. A detailed account of the way in which\r\nthis was done cannot be given, but is sufficiently indicated by what has\r\nalready been said.[549]\r\n\r\nMale brothels exist even at the present day in Paris. Thus, at the end\r\nof the year 1905 in the Rue St. Martin there was a small hotel whose\r\nhomosexual proprietor not only let rooms to urnings for a brief stay,\r\nbut also kept on the premises five or six young men between the ages of\r\nfifteen and twenty-two years, whose services were always available for\r\nhomosexuals for payment. Besides this hotel there existed also in the\r\nyear 1905 a kind of male brothel in the house of an urning, where at\r\nmidday half a dozen young fellows were to be found, or could be fetched\r\nat brief notice, for the choice of homosexual visitors, for whose use a\r\nroom was available at so many francs per hour.[550]\r\n\r\nA phenomenon intimately related with male prostitution is =blackmail=,\r\nor “=chantage=.” Tardieu (_op. cit._, pp. 128-130) describes these\r\nrelationships in vivid colours, and lays stress on the close\r\nrelationship between male prostitution and criminality. Blackmail has\r\nbecome to-day a kind of special profession,[551] which is not directed\r\nsolely against homosexuals, but also against heterosexuals, and the\r\npunishment of which cannot be too severe. Frequently these individuals,\r\nwhose activity is a danger to the community at large, persecute their\r\nvictims for many years in succession. Tardieu reports the case of a\r\ncelebrated literary man, “whose purse the blackmailers regarded as their\r\nown.” =For more than twenty years in succession= he was plucked by\r\nsuccessive generations of blackmailers, who considered him an assured\r\nsource of income. He was “passed on from one to another.” As a rule,\r\nblackmailers wait for their victims in public lavatories; they suddenly\r\nassert that they have been indecently assaulted, and demand hush-money,\r\nwhich is commonly given to them, even by heterosexuals. A case of the\r\nlast-mentioned kind recently occurred in Berlin, when a quite innocent\r\nyoung merchant was being plundered in this way, and his wife, by a\r\ncourageous denunciation of the shameless blackmailer, freed him from\r\nthis tyranny. It is, however, unquestionable that blackmail often ensues\r\nupon real advances on the part of homosexuals, and after the performance\r\nof sexual acts; and there is no doubt that in Germany the existence of §\r\n175 of the Criminal Code has been most advantageous to professional\r\nblackmailers, has led to numerous scandals (alike disagreeable and\r\ndangerous to the community), and has given rise to numerous suicides.\r\n\r\nThis celebrated § 175 runs as follows:\r\n\r\n  “Unnatural vice between two persons of the male sex, or between a man\r\n  and an animal, is punishable with imprisonment; it can also be\r\n  punished with loss of civil rights.”\r\n\r\nThis paragraph of the Imperial Criminal Code is identical with § 143 of\r\nthe former Prussian Criminal Code. Similar ordinances,[552] in some\r\ncases even more severe, are found in the laws of Austria-Hungary,\r\nNorway, Sweden, Denmark, Russia, Bulgaria, the State of New York, most\r\nof the cantons of Switzerland, and more especially in Great Britain,\r\nwhere the most severe punishments are inflicted, and, at any rate\r\nlogically, are inflicted also on women who practise homosexual\r\nintercourse. On the other hand, punishment for homosexual intercourse\r\nhas been completely =abolished= in France, Belgium, Holland, Portugal,\r\nTurkey, Italy, Spain, the Swiss Cantons of Genf, Wallis, Waadt and\r\nTessin, the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg, the Principality of Monaco, and in\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\n§ 143 of the Prussian Criminal Code was adopted as the basis of § 175 of\r\nthe German Criminal Code, in view of “the consciousness of right of the\r\npeople,” who “condemn such practices not only as vicious, but also as\r\ncriminal.” But this consciousness of right is based upon defective\r\nknowledge, and upon an erroneous view of homosexuality. As soon as we\r\nrecognize that in homosexuality we have to do with a primary natural\r\ndisposition, and as soon as this view has permeated wide circles of the\r\npopulation, the old consciousness of right will be replaced by a =new=\r\none, =which will demand the repeal of a criminal law=, by which =a\r\nnatural phenomenon= is regarded as a vice and a crime, and is esteemed\r\nas infamous. My studies in recent years having convinced me that in\r\nhomosexuality we have to do with a typical biological phenomenon, I feel\r\nthat I must unhesitatingly approve of the efforts of the =Scientific and\r\nHumanitarian Committee=, founded by Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld, which aims at\r\nmaking the people understand the nature of homosexuality, and demands\r\nthe repeal of § 175 of the German Criminal Code. All the more is this\r\nreform demanded because real homosexual =crimes= can be very readily\r\ndealt with by means of the sections of the Criminal Code relating to\r\nsexual delinquencies in general.\r\n\r\nApart from this general codification of the injustice of § 175, and\r\napart from the above-mentioned tragical consequences of the existence of\r\nthis section, it is also necessary to point out that the expressions\r\nused therein are absurd and illogical.\r\n\r\n1. Unnatural vice between men is punished, whereas that between women is\r\nleft impune. But why should this latter be the case, if we adopt the\r\nstandpoint (which we have, indeed, seen to be untenable) that homosexual\r\nintercourse is in itself vicious and criminal--why should homosexual\r\nintercourse between women be less vicious and criminal than homosexual\r\nintercourse between men?\r\n\r\n2. The idea “unnatural vice” is equally absurd and inconsequent, and\r\nmakes justice in respect of these offences absolutely impossible. By\r\nthis term is understood not merely pædication (_immissio membri in\r\nanum_), but also any kind of intercourse between men “resembling sexual\r\nintercourse”--that is, _coitus in os_, _coitus inter femora_, even\r\nsimple _frictio membri_--whilst mutual masturbation and other perverse\r\npractices are not punishable.\r\n\r\n3. § 175 does not safeguard any citizen,[553] for the sexual freedom of\r\nthe individual is not disturbed in any way by the intercourse between\r\ntwo adult men who fully understand what they are doing, nor is the\r\ngeneral moral sense injured in any way if the act is not seen by any\r\nthird person. In this latter respect, however, § 183 of the Criminal\r\nCode, which punishes annoyance to the public by improper conduct,\r\nalready affords sufficient protection.\r\n\r\n4. If § 175 is maintained with especial reference to the existence of\r\nprofessional male unchastity, von Liszt has rightly replied to this\r\ncontention that the latter form of unchastity can be rendered harmless\r\nby a modified reading of § 361_b_ of the Criminal Code, just as the\r\nprotection of virtue can be safeguarded by other sections of the Code.\r\n\r\n5. The effectiveness of § 175 is extremely limited. According to\r\nHirschfeld (“Annual for Sexual Intermediate Stages,” vol. vi., p. 175),\r\nno more than 0·007 % of the existing punishable homosexual practices of\r\nthe present day are detected and punished. Therefore a few =isolated=\r\nindividuals are punished for an offence which thousands of others commit\r\nwith impunity.\r\n\r\n6. When § 175 of the Criminal Code was drawn up, the law-givers knew\r\nabsolutely nothing about the homosexual impulse as an essential outcome\r\nof the personality; they merely wished to punish heterosexuals who\r\ncommitted homosexual practices, not to punish genuine homosexuals (_cf._\r\nNuma Prætorius, “The Question of the Responsibility of Homosexuals,”\r\npublished in the _Monthly Review of Criminal Psychology_, edited by G.\r\nAschaffenburg, 1906, p. 561).\r\n\r\nThe worst and most tragic consequence of § 175 is the permanent infamy\r\nand social contempt suffered by persons who, =without any blame to\r\nthemselves=, have a mode of sexual perception diverging from that of the\r\ngreat majority. The state itself commits a crime when it enrols in the\r\ncategory of vice and crime a biological phenomenon which has recently\r\nbeen recognized as such even by the Evangelical and Catholic\r\nChurches,[554] and has been freed by these Churches from the stigma of\r\nimmorality. The continuance of this great injustice is the frequent\r\ncause of the =suicide= of homosexuals, especially of such as are men of\r\nexceptional spiritual and moral cultivation, and =frequently before they\r\nhave actually indulged in their homosexual impulse=, the best proof that\r\nwe have to do, not with vicious, but with unhappy men, who are unable to\r\nbear the misery of being socially despised and unjustly misunderstood by\r\ntheir associates. How many suicides from homosexual grounds occur it is\r\nimpossible to establish exactly. We can only suspect the cause from\r\ncertain attendant circumstances. A highly respected literary man writes\r\nto me regarding this question of the suicide of homosexuals: “When a\r\nfine young fellow, suffering frightfully as a result of his inherited\r\ndisposition, shoots himself, his family will rather suggest that the\r\ncause was a chancre (which he has never had), than they will admit his\r\nhomosexuality.” Several such cases have come under his notice. “A better\r\ncause,” he suggests, “for the suicide would have been unhappy love, for\r\nthat is the actual truth.” Zola,[555] speaking of the letters of a\r\nhomosexual, says that they exhibited “the most heart-breaking cry of\r\nhuman agony” that he had ever known.\r\n\r\n  “He earnestly resisted yielding to such shameful, lustful love, and he\r\n  longed to know whence came this contempt of all men, whence this\r\n  continuous readiness of the law-courts to crush him down, when in his\r\n  flesh and blood were inborn a disgust towards woman, whilst he had\r\n  brought into the world with him a true feeling of love towards man.\r\n  Never had one possessed by a demon, never had a poor human body given\r\n  up to and tortured by the unknown powers of the sexual impulse, so\r\n  painfully expressed his misery. Have we not here a truly physiological\r\n  case definitely displayed before our eyes--an inversion, an error, on\r\n  the part of Nature? Nothing, in my opinion, is more tragical, and\r\n  nothing demands more urgently investigation and a means of cure, if\r\n  such can possibly be found.”\r\n\r\nThe =complete enlightenment= of the people would give rise to a\r\nspontaneous change in their conception of homosexuality, to which,\r\nmoreover, the greater number of homosexuals belonging to the better\r\nclasses could contribute, if they would freely and openly admit their\r\ntendencies. The secrecy and hypocrisy of many urnings is partly\r\nresponsible for the hitherto prevailing false views on homosexuality. We\r\ncannot spare them this reproach.\r\n\r\nFinally, § 175 is not merely an injustice to homosexuals, but it is also\r\na danger to heterosexuals, in consequence of the =blackmail= which is so\r\nintimately associated with the existence of this section. It is not\r\nenough that these criminals of the most debased kind, who to a small\r\nextent only are recruited from the ranks of male prostitutes, reduce\r\nnumerous unhappy urnings to social and financial ruin, and drive many\r\nothers to suicide or to crime, of which the remarkable case of a County\r\nCourt Judge a few years ago afforded a typical example. These wretches\r\nalso dare with ever-greater success to make use of § 175 for the purpose\r\nof blackmailing =completely normal heterosexuals=. In fact, they often\r\nsucceed better with these latter than they do with homosexuals, because\r\nto the normal man the idea of being regarded as homosexual is so\r\nrepulsive.\r\n\r\nA remedy for all these evils--for the suicides as well as for the\r\nblackmailing--can only be found in the =enlightenment= of the whole\r\npeople--the first and most important thing to do--and in the\r\n=unconditional repeal= of § 175 of the Criminal Code.\r\n\r\nIt has been a most useful service on the part of the Scientific and\r\nHumanitarian Committee--a service the value of which has not yet been\r\nsufficiently recognized--that it has endeavoured, above all, to bring\r\nabout the enlightenment of the people by means of popular writings,[556]\r\nand of the learned by means of scientific publications, such as the most\r\nsuccessful _Annual for Sexual Intermediate Stages_ (8 volumes,\r\n1899-1906), and by means of lectures, by the convocation of public\r\nmeetings, by petitions, etc.\r\n\r\nThe petition of the committee to the legislative bodies of the German\r\nEmpire, asking for the repeal of § 175 of the Criminal Code, was signed\r\nby 5,000 persons belonging to the circles of men of science, judges,\r\nphysicians, priests, schoolmasters, authors, and artists, among whom\r\nwere some of the most celebrated names of cultured Germany.

We may, therefore, expect that the repeal will be effected\r\nwithin the next few years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCompared with true original homosexuality in men, the same condition in\r\nwomen is of considerably less importance, because in women homosexuality\r\nis undoubtedly =much less common= than it is in men. In comparison with\r\nthe number of urnings, the number of =female homosexuals=--of\r\n“=urnindes=,” “=Lesbian lovers=,” or “=tribades=”--is relatively small;\r\nwhereas in many women, even at a comparatively advanced age, the\r\nso-called “pseudo-homosexuality” (see the next chapter) is much more\r\nfrequently met with than it is in men. In the case of heterosexual men\r\nit is usually impossible to induce a homosexual mode of perception or to\r\ngive rise to any kind of taste for homosexual activity; whereas in\r\nheterosexual women the corresponding change certainly occurs much more\r\neasily. Tendernesses and caresses play, indeed, among normal\r\nheterosexual women a rôle which makes it easier for us to understand how\r\nreadily in woman pseudo-homosexual tendencies may arise. =Still, it is\r\nimpossible to doubt the existence also of original homosexuality in\r\nwomen.= These are the cases in which, just as in urnings, the homosexual\r\nimpulse appears in very early childhood, often long before puberty, in\r\nwhich case also the girl is distinguished from her heterosexual comrades\r\nin external appearance, exhibiting indications of a masculine build of\r\nbody (slight development of the breasts, narrowness of the pelvis,\r\ndevelopment of a moustache, a deep voice, etc.); but such indications\r\nmay be entirely absent, and the girl may not be distinguished from\r\nothers in any respect beyond the perverse direction of the sexual\r\nimpulse. These true tribades are much rarer than the false tribades, the\r\npseudo-Lesbian lovers. For example, when visiting an urnings’ ball we\r\nmay be quite sure that 99 % of the male homosexuals assembled there are\r\ntrue homosexuals; but at a tribades’ ball--such, also, are given in\r\nBerlin--certainly a much smaller percentage are “genuine”; the bulk of\r\nthe women present are pseudo-homosexuals. I here append the interesting\r\nreminiscences of a genuine urninde, by which this relationship between\r\noriginal homosexuality and pseudo-homosexuality in women is very clearly\r\nshown:\r\n\r\n  THOUGHTS OF A LONELY WOMAN!\r\n\r\n  “Born in the country, the daughter of a merchant, I grew up as a very\r\n  dreamy being, with an unceasing yearning after something unknown,\r\n  beautiful, great--with a longing to become a singer or an artist. At\r\n  the age of twelve I was already completely ‘woman,’ very luxuriantly\r\n  developed, although still half a child, =filled always with an\r\n  uncontrollable longing for a beloved feminine being who should kiss me\r\n  and caress me=, whom I was to regard with love and with a sentiment of\r\n  self-sacrifice. At the age of thirteen I came to live with relatives\r\n  in a provincial town, where for a year I attended a young ladies’\r\n  school. Of my dreams no single one could be fulfilled. My mother, who\r\n  was widowed when I was only three years old, had a severe economical\r\n  struggle, being encumbered with six small children. After my elder\r\n  brothers and sisters were married, I myself, being then twenty-four\r\n  years of age, had to go out into the world to seek my own living,\r\n  ignorant of the world and its dangers, delivered up to commonness and\r\n  intrigue. I got a position in the house of a widow, filling the post\r\n  of ‘companion.’ My ‘principal,’ a woman sixty years of age, was at\r\n  first unsympathetic to me, but she treated me in a loving and motherly\r\n  manner, which pleased me, for I was of a pliant and receptive\r\n  disposition. Gradually I became her confidante. Every evening I had to\r\n  get into bed with her (I slept close by); I must touch her with my\r\n  hands. I did not then really understand why I had to stroke her legs;\r\n  but one evening this sexagenarian guided my hand into a forbidden\r\n  place. Now it became clear to me that this woman still had erotic\r\n  perceptions. I felt how she quivered under my touch, pressed me firmly\r\n  to herself, etc.; but I, for my part, felt nothing. It might have\r\n  been different had she been a friend of my own age. I had not at that\r\n  time any idea that ‘psychically’ I was different from other girls. I\r\n  had an unceasing yearning for love, not directly sensual love, but\r\n  spiritual love, out of which sensual love might later develop. Among\r\n  the inmates of our house was a young merchant, a fine-looking man, who\r\n  besieged me with his love, and, after long hesitation, I at length one\r\n  day consented to give him the best that woman has to give. He took\r\n  possession of my body with brutal voluptuousness. I was under the\r\n  delusion that he would make me his wife. I had in the sexual act =no\r\n  perception at all=, and was disillusioned. One day my seducer told me\r\n  that he was going to be married, asking me to return him the ring he\r\n  had given me, and offering me money. Moved to the inmost soul, without\r\n  any human being to give me counsel or help (from a feeling of shame I\r\n  had not disclosed the matter to my principal), I threw the ring at\r\n  him, resigned my position, and made myself independent. I will only\r\n  say in a few words how I had to struggle, to fight for my existence,\r\n  how I was lied to and deceived by rascally men. When I came to Berlin\r\n  I heard and read of homosexual love, but could not find what I dreamed\r\n  of--namely, spiritual love, out of which sensual love might spring. I\r\n  learned to know homosexual women, but they exhibited to me such\r\n  elemental passion, brutality, sensuality, that, notwithstanding all my\r\n  yearning for ‘homosexual’ love, I remained unresponsive. Only in\r\n  kissing the lips of a woman sympathetic to me I have experienced an\r\n  agreeable sensation, but that sweet state which I was able to induce\r\n  in others by contact with them was =in me= not forthcoming. I began to\r\n  wonder whether Nature had denied me this sensation, though I was\r\n  myself also a normally developed woman. For years I lived\r\n  ‘ascetically,’ since I regarded myself as a ‘psychological’ problem--I\r\n  avoided every kind of intercourse--I only had a desire for tenderness\r\n  and caresses. I often loved handsome women, feeling the wish to kiss\r\n  them and to touch them, and I had learned to know women of the kind\r\n  who prostitute themselves to other women for money. These were hateful\r\n  to me, and never could I form a friendship with such, because they\r\n  knew only common brutal sensuality, towards which I was not\r\n  responsive.\r\n\r\n  “Some years ago I suffered from a severe abdominal and nervous\r\n  disorder. I have already passed my fortieth year. After an illness\r\n  lasting two years, I still feel the desire for homosexual love.\r\n  Hitherto I have lived unhappily, continually asking myself why Nature\r\n  has treated me so cruelly. Is it not possible once at least to enjoy\r\n  this perception? A few weeks ago I made the acquaintance of a married\r\n  woman, whose husband has been impotent for years, whilst she, on the\r\n  other hand, is a very passionate character. Unfortunately, this woman,\r\n  although in other respects she is very sympathetic to me, is upon a\r\n  comparatively low plane of culture, and, what frightens me more, she\r\n  has an intimacy with a female friend who is quite uncultured, but who\r\n  resembles her in respect of sexual love, and who night after night\r\n  lies with her in bed =beside the husband=, and the two women indulge\r\n  their perverse voluptuousness, the friend playing the ‘man’s’ part. I\r\n  have seen many strange things in my course through life, but =such a\r\n  marriage= is a new experience to me. The man terms himself an artist,\r\n  a painter, and allows his wife free play in bisexual love. I believe\r\n  that this man himself experiences a titillation of the senses when he\r\n  sees the two women together, and also that he makes drawings of\r\n  ‘acts,’ out of which he makes a profit. In this house I have seen into\r\n  a deep abyss, yet other bisexual women visit it. Although I have found\r\n  my peace disturbed by these women, although I have been to a certain\r\n  extent intoxicated, the conditions are too repulsive to me--since this\r\n  woman is sunk into a morass deeper than she herself understands. Only\r\n  through me does she begin to understand it. But a longer intercourse\r\n  with her is impossible, for she lacks all the qualities that I look\r\n  for in a woman whom I could love. In actual fact I envy this creature,\r\n  for she is happy, since she experiences to the full those sweet\r\n  sensations which Nature denies to me. Are there any more beings\r\n  unhappy like myself? Perhaps the acquaintanceship with a woman whose\r\n  feelings were similar to my own would be a happiness, if Fate would\r\n  only have so much pity upon me as to throw a sorrowful companion in my\r\n  way. I hope for it, but I do not believe that it will happen.\r\n\r\n  “To what sex do I really belong?”\r\n\r\nIn the love-history of this genuine urninde the ideal element is\r\nespecially manifest; likewise the instinctive disinclination to man,\r\nwhich, remarkably enough, is often more powerfully developed in strongly\r\nfeminine characters than in the more masculine tribades, as the\r\nprototype of which latter we may mention the painter Rosa Bonheur.\r\nDuring childhood Rosa Bonheur felt herself to be a boy, and preferred\r\nthe society of boys to that of girls.[557] Throughout her life,\r\nnotwithstanding her homosexual love, she felt strong sympathy with men.\r\nSuch a double relationship occurs also among urnindes of the first kind.\r\nEven the true urninde, I may say, is =not so extremely homosexual= as is\r\nthe true urning. Take, for example, the following account[558] of an\r\noriginal homosexual, and you will see the difference:\r\n\r\n  “I have not lost any of the valuable things of life--far otherwise.\r\n  Many-sided, many-shadowed intellectual sympathy leads any man of lofty\r\n  mind into harmony with me. There emanates unconsciously from my soul a\r\n  profound, tender charm. My friends find me necessary to them. I share\r\n  their interests. In our relationship there pass between us the most\r\n  wonderful shades of sympathetic feeling--what the French so\r\n  expressively speak of as _l’amitié amoureuse_. Thus my mode of being\r\n  becomes absorbed into that of my friend, a peculiar melody passes to\r\n  and fro between us, and a peculiar melody sounds in the stillness of\r\n  my own soul. All the fine and delicate sensations which I have\r\n  received from my friends become in me transformed into poietic\r\n  force--the ecstasies of my spirit assume form and substance. From the\r\n  spiritualization of the impulse there springs a stream clear as\r\n  crystal, there arise passion and ardour; my exceptional soul lifts me\r\n  upwards, above all sorrows and vexations. In this way is a talent\r\n  conceived, and amid ecstasy it is born.”\r\n\r\nThe need for a spiritual contact with men is among homosexual women much\r\nstronger than the corresponding inclination on the part of urnings for\r\nspiritual contact with woman natures. For this reason there is no doubt\r\nthat the “=Woman’s Movement=”--that is, in the movement directed towards\r\nthe acquirement by women of all the attainments of masculine\r\nculture--homosexual women have played a notable part.[559] Indeed,\r\naccording to one author,[560] the “Woman’s Question” is mainly the\r\nquestion regarding the destiny of virile homosexual women. I find it\r\nnecessary to doubt whether, as Hammer maintains,[561] the raging hatred\r\nof men--the converse quality to the anti-feminism of the male\r\nurnings--really proceeds from the uranian group of the Woman’s Movement,\r\nfor there exist no literary documents of importance to prove the\r\nsuggested connexion. Homosexual women of intellectual weight have also\r\nassured me that among them there does at times exist an enmity to men on\r\nprinciple, just as, _mutatis mutandis_, misogyny has been developed as a\r\nsystem both from the heterosexual and from the homosexual side. For the\r\ndiffusion of pseudo-homosexuality the Woman’s Movement is of great\r\nimportance, as we shall see later.\r\n\r\nThe individual and social relationships of feminine uranism are nearly\r\nthe same as those of male uranism. In both cases there exists an entire\r\nscale, running from pure Platonism to ardent sensuality. One kind of\r\nPlatonic tribades are those described by Catulle Mendés in his sketch\r\n“Protectrices.” These are ladies of position who allow themselves the\r\nluxury of a “protégée,” generally a girl employed at the theatre, with\r\nwhom during the performances they exchange glances, whose expenses they\r\npay, with whom they go out driving, without the matter proceeding to\r\nactual sexual relations. In other cases, however, sensual gratification\r\nis the desired goal, which is attained by kisses, embraces, friction of\r\nthe genital organs, or cuninilinctus (the so-called “=Sapphism=”). In\r\nthis intercourse one party--the “father”--plays the active part, the\r\nother--“the mother”--the passive part. There exist passionate and\r\nintimate relationships of long duration--true “marriages”--among\r\ntribades. Thus, d’Estoc reports (“Paris-Eros,” p. 58) relationships of\r\nthis kind which have lasted thirty years. Still, as a general rule,\r\nfeminine homosexuals change their relationships more frequently than\r\nmale homosexuals. An elderly tribade, whose correspondence lies before\r\nme, had within four years three love relationships. In these\r\nrelationships jealousy plays an even greater part than in heterosexual\r\nliaisons. Two sympathetic urnindes who lived together described to me\r\nvery vividly the joys and sorrows of the _amor lesbicus_. The cause of\r\nthe troubles is always a _tertia_, never a _tertius gaudens_.\r\n\r\nLike the urnings, the tribades also have their meeting-places, _jour\r\nfixes_. One such meeting, at which four genuine female homosexuals and\r\none male homosexual assembled, I had the opportunity of attending. They\r\nhave their parties, and even their balls, at which the virile tribades\r\nappear in men’s clothing,[562] and (as also when at home) use male\r\nnicknames. There also exist female prostitutes who devote their services\r\nentirely to urnindes. This tribadistic prostitution is especially\r\nwidespread in Paris. Such prostitutes are called _gouines_, or\r\n_gougnottes_, or _chevalières du clair de lune_. Theatrical agents are\r\nsaid to be especially occupied with tribadistic procurement. There also\r\nexist tribadistic brothels in Paris.[563]\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nTHEORY OF HOMOSEXUALITY\r\n\r\nOriginal, congenital, enduring homosexuality would appear to be an\r\nexclusively human peculiarity. It is very doubtful whether a similar\r\ncondition exists among animals. We recognize among the lower animals\r\nhomosexual acts, but no homosexuality.[564] Thus we have no philogenetic\r\nstarting-point for the explanation of homosexuality. Moreover,\r\nhomosexuality is fundamentally different from the other sexual\r\nperversions, sadism and masochism. These represent quite =extreme= forms\r\nof biological phenomena, an abnormal increase of physiological impulsive\r\nmanifestations that occur in the normal heterosexual life, as part of\r\nsexuality in general. But homosexuality is an alteration =in the\r\ndirection of the very impulse itself=--a change in the very nature of\r\nsexuality. To put the matter shortly, it is the appearance of a\r\nsexuality =heterogeneous to and not corresponding with the bodily\r\nstructure=. To define homosexuality as the appearance of a feminine\r\nsexual psyche in a masculine body, or of a masculine sexual psyche in a\r\nfeminine body, does not apply to all cases--for example, it does not\r\napply to virile urnings or to tribades who remain womanly. The\r\ndefinition of homosexuality as a sexuality which does not correspond to\r\nthe bodily structure embraces both these possibilities.\r\n\r\nWhenever homosexuality in men is associated with a marked development of\r\nfeminine secondary sexual characters, or in women with a marked\r\ndevelopment of masculine secondary sexual characters, the homosexual\r\nsensibility may be said to have to some extent a physical basis, but not\r\ncompletely so. For the “intermediate stage theory” proposed by\r\nHirschfeld--the intermixture of feminine and masculine characters--may\r\napply satisfactorily to “bisexuality,” to indeterminate sexual\r\nsensibility; but it does not apply to the thoroughly one-sided, monistic\r\nsexual sensibility, directed =only= towards members of the same sex, and\r\noften appearing very early, before the days of puberty. Moreover, in\r\nheterosexual male individuals the external appearance may at times\r\nsuggest that there is a strong intermixture of feminine characters.\r\nThese men, though heterosexual, have a womanly appearance.\r\n\r\nThe “intermediate stage theory” of Hirschfeld, which von Krafft-Ebing\r\nalso appears to have recognized in his last work (“New Studies in the\r\nSubject of Homosexuality”), a theory which explains homosexual phenomena\r\nas dependent upon the existence of transitional stages between the sexes\r\n(“sexual links” of Hirschfeld), and which, moreover, erroneously\r\nincludes the typical hermaphrodite states--this interesting theory\r\nexplains =a portion only= of original homosexuality. It fails in cases\r\n=in which homosexuality occurs in the absence of any divergence from\r\ntype=--for example, in those cases in which male individuals with\r\nthoroughly normal masculine bodies exhibit marked homosexual sensibility\r\nin early childhood, long before puberty. But these are the cases which\r\noffer the greatest possible difficulties to a scientific explanation.\r\n_Hic Rhodus, hic salta!_\r\n\r\nUlrich’s “feminine soul in a masculine body” applies to =effeminate\r\nurnings=, such as he was himself. But is the mode of sensibility of\r\n=virile= homosexuals “effeminate”? Why do we speak of a third sex? Here\r\nlie difficulties which we cannot overcome without further assistance.\r\n\r\nHow does it come to pass that the central organs in homosexuals do not\r\ncorrespond to the peripheral sexual organs, although the latter are\r\nformed embryologically long before the former, so that the central\r\norgans should properly be guided in their development by the peripheral\r\norgans? But they are not so guided. That is only explicable in this\r\nway--that the association between the central organs and the peripheral\r\norgans is interrupted by a third influence, and that =this last\r\ninfluence has a peculiar effect= upon the central organs =altogether\r\nindependent of the nature of the reproductive glands=.\r\n\r\nI will formulate this new theory of homosexuality in the following\r\nterms:\r\n\r\n1. The so-called “undifferentiated stage” of the sexual impulse (Max\r\nDessoir) may often fail to appear in cases in which the sexual impulse,\r\neither in heterosexuals or homosexuals, is definitely directed before\r\npuberty unmistakably towards the members of one particular sex.\r\nEspecially in homosexuals do we often see =before= puberty the clear and\r\nunmistakable direction of the sexual impulse towards members of the\r\n=same= sex.\r\n\r\n2. A critical theory of homosexuality must also explain the extreme\r\ncases; above all, it must also explain male homosexuality associated\r\nwith complete virility.\r\n\r\n3. The sexual organs and the reproductive glands cannot be the\r\ndetermining cause, because homosexuality makes its appearance in\r\nassociation with thoroughly typical male reproductive organs; nor can\r\nthe brain be the determining cause in cases of true homosexuality, for,\r\nnotwithstanding the intentional and unintentional operation of\r\nheterosexual influences on thought and imagination, homosexuality cannot\r\nbe eradicated, and continues to develop.\r\n\r\n4. Since this homosexuality often makes its appearance as an inclination\r\n(not as the sexual impulse) long =before= puberty, and =before= the\r\nproper activity of the reproductive glands is developed, it appears a\r\nreasonable suggestion that in homosexuality some physiological\r\nmanifestation associated with “sexuality,” but not directly associated\r\nwith the reproductive glands, undergoes a =change= which results in an\r\nalteration of the direction of the sexual impulse.\r\n\r\n6. The most obvious influences to think of in this connexion are\r\n=chemical= influences, changes in the chemistry of sexual tension, which\r\nlatter is certainly to a large extent =independent= of the reproductive\r\nglands, since it may persist in eunuchs. But the nature of this sexual\r\nchemistry is still entirely obscure.\r\n\r\nSuch a way of conceiving the process is thoroughly reasonable and\r\ntenable on scientific grounds, as was shown by E. H. Starling and L.\r\nKrehl[565] in their communication to the Scientific Congress at\r\nStuttgart in the year 1905, regarding disturbances of chemical\r\ncorrelation in the organism, especially disturbances of the chemical\r\ninfluences proceeding from the reproductive organs. All minuter details\r\nregarding these “sexual hormone” (to use Starling’s own phrase) are\r\nstill unknown, but the experiments to which we alluded in an earlier\r\nchapter have proved their existence. In my view, the anatomical\r\ncontradiction, the natural monstrosity, of a feminine--or, at any rate,\r\nan unmanly--psyche in a typical masculine body, or that of a feminine or\r\nunmanly sexual psyche associated with normally developed and normally\r\nfunctioning male genital organs, can only be explained in this manner by\r\ntaking into account this intercurrent third factor. This can be deduced\r\nvery readily from some early =embryonic disturbances= of sexual\r\nchemistry. This would also explain why it is that homosexuality so often\r\noccurs in perfectly healthy families, as an isolated phenomenon which\r\nhas nothing to do either with inheritance or with degeneration. When von\r\nRömer, on the contrary, describes homosexuality as a process of\r\n“regeneration,” we must maintain that for this view there are no\r\nsufficient grounds. Here begins the =riddle= of homosexuality; for me,\r\nat any rate, it is one. My own theory only attempts to explain the\r\nproper physiological connexions of homosexuality better, and, above all,\r\nmore scientifically than earlier theories. With regard to the ultimate\r\ncause of the relatively frequent occurrence of homosexuality as an\r\noriginal phenomenon, this theory has, however, nothing to say.\r\n\r\nI do not suggest that I am able for a moment to find the ultimate reason\r\nof the being and nature of homosexuality. There remains here a riddle to\r\nbe solved. But from the standpoint of civilization and reproduction\r\nhomosexuality is a senseless and aimless dysteleological phenomenon,\r\nlike many another “natural product”--as, for example, the human cæcum.\r\nIn an earlier chapter I drew attention to the fact that civilization has\r\nentailed an increasingly sharp sexual differentiation--that is, the\r\nantithesis between “man” and “woman” has become continually clearer.\r\nThe distinction between the sexes is a product rather of civilization\r\nthan of primitive nature. All sexual indifference, all sexual links, are\r\nprimitive characters. Eduard von Mayer rightly believes that in the\r\nearliest days of the human race homosexuality was much more widely\r\ndiffused than it is at present, that, in fact, it came into being side\r\nby side with heterosexual love. Civilization by means of inheritance,\r\nadaptation, and differentiation, has continually more and more limited\r\nthe extent of the homosexual impulse. Unquestionably the homosexual\r\nhuman being, =as human being=, has the same right to exist as the\r\nheterosexual. To doubt it would be preposterous. Also, as a sexual\r\nbeing, in so far as only the individual aspect of love comes under\r\nconsideration, the homosexual has an equal right. But for the species,\r\nand also for the advancement of civilization, homosexuality has no\r\nimportance, or very little. It is obvious that, as a kind of enduring\r\n“monosexuality,” it contradicts the purposes of the species. Equally\r\nobvious is it that the whole of civilization is the product of the\r\nphysical and mental differentiation of the sexes, that civilization has,\r\nin fact, to a certain extent, a heterosexual character. The greatest\r\nspiritual values we owe to heterosexuals, not to homosexuals. =Moreover,\r\nreproduction first renders possible the preservation and permanence of\r\nnew spiritual values.= In the last resort the latter are not possible\r\nwithout the former. However obvious it may appear, we must still repeat\r\nthat spiritual values exist only in respect of the =future=, that they\r\nonly attain their true significance =in the connexion and the succession\r\nof the generations=, and that they are, therefore, eternally dependent\r\nupon heterosexual love as the intermediary by which this continuity is\r\nproduced. The monosexual and homosexual instincts permanently limited to\r\ntheir own ego or their own sex are, therefore, in their innermost nature\r\n=dysteleological= and =anti-evolutionistic=. In speaking thus we leave\r\nentirely out of consideration the possibility that temporarily and for\r\nthe purposes of individual development they may possess a relative\r\njustification.[566]\r\n\r\nMoreover, the majority of homosexuals have a deeply rooted sentiment of\r\nthe lack of purpose and the aimlessness of their mode of sexual\r\nperception, and this often gives them a very tragical and pitiable\r\nexpression. Especially in the case of noble, spiritually important\r\nhomosexuals, true carriers of civilization, is this sense of the\r\nincongruity between homosexuality and life most plainly felt. Even the\r\ntalented Numa Prætorius (_Annual for Sexual Intermediate Stages_, vol.\r\nvi., p. 543) recognizes that--\r\n\r\n  “The love of the majority of men towards the other sex, based upon\r\n  heterosexual impulse, has undergone a development and refinement, and\r\n  has obtained a significance which makes homosexual love, in comparison\r\n  with it, play quite a subordinate part.”\r\n\r\n  [502] “Contributions to the Etiology of Psychopathia Sexualis,” vol.\r\n  i., p. 219.\r\n\r\n  [503] Lombroso, at the Sixth International Congress of Criminal\r\n  Anthropologists at Turin, May, 1906, actually drew a parallel between\r\n  congenital homosexuality and the congenital tendency to crime! That\r\n  this parallel is utterly non-existent and that crime and homosexuality\r\n  differ toto cælo is shown luminously by Paul Näcke (“Comparison\r\n  between Criminality and Homosexuality,” published in the\r\n  _Monatsschrift für Kriminalpsychologie_, 1906, pp. 477-487).\r\n\r\n  [504] Published in the _Annual for Sexual Intermediate Stages_, edited\r\n  by Magnus Hirschfeld, vol. iii., p. 5 (Leipzig, 1901). _Cf._ also the\r\n  account of the newer views by P.

The same is\r\n  true as regards the description of the corresponding types of\r\n  homosexual women.\r\n\r\n  [509] This occurs also in heterosexual boys. I extract the following\r\n  passage from the unpublished autobiography of a homosexual\r\n  =physician=: “When puberty occurred I am not able to say--I expect it\r\n  was about the age of sixteen or seventeen--but I know certainly that I\r\n  noticed at the time of puberty a swelling of the breasts. There was\r\n  only a slight forward curvature, which did not extend much beyond the\r\n  areola, and was painful on pressure. I remember distinctly that I was\r\n  anxious about the matter, and was afraid that there was some\r\n  inflammation beginning. =However, the same seems to occur in every\r\n  normal man.= A student whom I asked about the matter said that he had\r\n  noticed a swelling of the mammary glands about the age of fifteen;\r\n  recently, at the age of seventeen, he has had his first pollutions;\r\n  his sexual sensibility is normal.”\r\n\r\n  [510] “Goethe’s Letters,” vol. vii., p. 314: letter of December 29,\r\n  1787, from Rome to Karl August (Weimar, 1890).\r\n\r\n  [511] G.

True homosexuality is\r\ncongenital. It is an original, =permanent, essential outflow= of the\r\npersonality: pseudo-homosexuality, on the contrary, is either a\r\nhomosexual sensibility suggested from without, transient, and not\r\nassociated with the essence of the personality; or else it is merely\r\n=apparent= homosexuality, the illusion being dependent upon\r\nhermaphroditism or upon some other physical or mental abnormality.\r\n\r\nThe pseudo-homosexuality of the former category is explicable only by\r\nmeans of the fact of “=bisexuality=,” the existence of which has been\r\nscientifically proved only within recent years. By bisexuality we\r\nunderstand the possibility of two distinct modes of sexual perception\r\noccurring in one and the same person; and this, again, finds its\r\nexplanation in the bisexual germinal vestiges which exist in every\r\nindividual. There remains in every man a vestige of woman, in every\r\nwoman a vestige of man, in a sense in a state of potential energy,\r\nwhich, however, is capable, by the action of various external\r\ninfluences, of being transformed into kinetic energy; but this vestige\r\n=always= plays a small part in comparison with the true specific sexual\r\nnature. This bisexuality was discussed in an earlier chapter of this\r\nbook (pp. 39, 40 and 70, 71), and was there characterized as a\r\nphenomenon secondary in every respect, to which no great importance\r\ncould be attached. The idea of bisexuality is not new; neither Fliess\r\nnor Weininger was its discoverer. It was already known to the\r\nancients.[567] Heinse, in “Ardinghello,” gives expression to the idea in\r\nalmost the same words as Weininger (see p. 40). Recently Magnus\r\nHirschfeld[568] has collected the historical and literary details of the\r\nsubject of bisexuality.\r\n\r\nBisexuality manifests itself more especially at the period of puberty,\r\nduring the time of obscure yearnings and impulses--the so-called\r\nindifferent period which precedes the awakening of the sexual impulse.\r\nPhysical bisexuality, therefore, often enough corresponds to psychical\r\nbisexuality. In the boy there is a trace of girlishness, in the girl a\r\ntrace of boyishness; we have the two types of the dreamy youth and of\r\nthe tomboy. Then there readily arise delicate inclinations between\r\nindividuals of like sexes, especially as the result of continuous\r\ncompanionship, so that an obscure impulse of transient homosexual\r\nperception manifests itself between two boys, or between two girls, of\r\nthe same age; or, again, this transient homosexuality may take the form\r\nof a worshipful admiration of an older person of the same sex. Gutzkow\r\ndistinguished these two forms of pseudo-homosexuality, of which he had\r\nhad experience in his own person. In his “Secular Pictures,” vol. i.,\r\npp. 50, 51 (Frankfort, 1856), he remarks:\r\n\r\n  “The feeling of love originates in most feminine natures, not from the\r\n  quiet consideration of the secrets of love, but from a magnetic\r\n  attraction towards other individuals, whom they regard as being better\r\n  and more beautiful than themselves. Commonly the love for a man is\r\n  preceded by an often illimitable love for a woman. Young girls fall in\r\n  love with older girls--a phenomenon which often occurs also in boys,\r\n  as I myself experienced when a boy, feeling the most ardent passion\r\n  for one of my comrades, who now is extremely disagreeable to me.”\r\n\r\nA similar explanation suffices for the transient tender love exhibited\r\nby Grillparzer towards Altmüller (_cf._ Grillparzer’s “Diary,” edition\r\nof Glossy and Sauer, pp. 24-26; Stuttgart). In boarding-schools,\r\nbarracks, and training-schools we often find these pseudo-homosexual\r\nliaisons. The prison is said by Parent-Duchatelet to be a high-school of\r\ntribadism. He and other French authors report the epidemic diffusion of\r\nhomosexual practices in prisons for women. Whenever homosexuality\r\nappears =suddenly= in an epidemic manner, =affecting large numbers of\r\nindividuals=, we have to do, not with genuine original uranism, but with\r\npseudo-homosexuality. As regards boarding-schools, which exhibit a\r\nlascivious environment extremely open to manifestations of this kind,\r\nHans von Kahlenberg, in his “Nixchen,” p. 41 (Vienna, 1904), has vividly\r\ndescribed the matter.\r\n\r\nYouthful bisexuality is to be found in slighter forms in almost every\r\nhuman being, but it is a typical phenomenon of puberty, and disappears\r\nwith the passing of this epoch, to make room for the completely\r\ndeveloped heterosexuality of the adult. There occurs also in\r\nhomosexuals, in whom homosexual sensibility first makes itself\r\ndefinitely manifest after puberty, a quite analogous inclination to the\r\nother sex before and during puberty. Thus, a typical homosexual\r\ntwenty-three years of age, who now exhibits _horror feminæ_, related to\r\nme that at the age of sixteen or seventeen years he was very fond of\r\ngirls, and pursued them a great deal, but without definite sexual\r\ndesire. This transient obscure attraction of homosexuals towards the\r\nother sex is a kind of “pseudo-heterosexuality.”\r\n\r\nSometimes bisexuality will continue after the period of puberty, and in\r\nexceptional cases will persist throughout life. According to Hirschfeld,\r\nthis occurs especially in men of genius, and in those inclined to become\r\npriests or schoolmasters. But in most cases even then one or other\r\nimpulsive tendency--the heterosexual or the homosexual--is predominant.\r\nThese individuals have been called “psychical hermaphrodites” (von\r\nKrafft-Ebing). These bisexual varieties may manifest themselves in very\r\nvarious ways, in most cases gynandry or androgyny is purely spiritual,\r\nand finds expression only in association with particular tendencies,\r\nespecially =fetichistic= tendencies. The two following very remarkable\r\ncases throw a clear light on this peculiar form of bisexuality. We may\r\nas well accept for the more or less specific form of bisexuality\r\ndescribed in these cases the suggested name of “junores.”\r\n\r\n  1.The case of a psychical hermaphrodite:\r\n\r\n  N. N., an American journalist, thirty-three years of age, writes:\r\n  “From earliest youth I had an impulse to appear dressed in women’s\r\n  clothing, and whenever I had an opportunity I had elegant body linen\r\n  made for me, silken chemises, and whatever was the fashion. Even as a\r\n  boy I used to borrow my sister’s clothing and wear it secretly. Only\r\n  later, after my mother’s death, was I able to give free rein to my\r\n  wishes, and I came into the possession of a wardrobe resembling that\r\n  of the most elegant lady of fashion. Although compelled in the daytime\r\n  to appear as a man, still I wear, under these clothes, a complete\r\n  outfit of women’s underclothing--stays, open-work stockings, and\r\n  everything proper to a woman, a bracelet also, and patent-leather\r\n  women’s boots, with elegant high heels. When the evening comes, I\r\n  breathe more freely. Then I can throw off the burdensome mask, and\r\n  feel wholly woman. Wrapped in a tea-gown of an elegant cut, and\r\n  wearing the finest underclothing, I am able to occupy myself in my\r\n  favourite employments, among which may be mentioned the study of the\r\n  primitive history of mankind, or I give myself up to some routine\r\n  duties. A feeling of repose takes possession of me, such as is\r\n  impossible during the day, when I have to wear men’s clothing.\r\n  Although fully woman, I do not feel any need to give myself to a man.\r\n  I feel flattered, certainly, if, when appearing in women’s dress, I\r\n  please others, but I have no definite sexual desire towards my own\r\n  sex. It may be that I have not yet discovered my _alter ego_.\r\n  Notwithstanding all my well-developed feminine customs, I married, and\r\n  am the father of a powerful, beautiful girl, who exhibits no\r\n  tendencies whatever resembling mine. My wife, an energetic, cultured\r\n  lady, was fully aware of my passion, but hoped in the course of time\r\n  to wean me from it. In this, however, she was not successful. I\r\n  performed my marital duties, but I gave myself up all the more to my\r\n  customs. My wife obtained a separation, and at the time at which I now\r\n  write she is intimate with another man, and is pregnant. My physique\r\n  is thoroughly masculine, with the exception of the pelvis and of the\r\n  calves of the legs, which are feminine in form. Summary: Outward\r\n  appearance masculine. When wearing women’s dress I have completely the\r\n  corresponding figure--waist, 20 inches; chest measurement, 34 inches;\r\n  height, 176 centimetres (5 feet 9 inches); weight 125 pounds. Hands\r\n  long and narrow, sensibility feminine. When wearing men’s clothing I\r\n  feel a certain uneasiness. When I see an elegant lady or actress, I\r\n  think how well I should appear in her dress. I have an abundance of\r\n  earrings, pearls, lace scarves, and similar articles of adornment, and\r\n  at a dance I give myself up to the idea of how delightful it would be\r\n  to appear in women’s dress. If it were possible, I should completely\r\n  abandon men’s clothing.”\r\n\r\n  2. “At about the age of fifteen and a half years I began to take an\r\n  interest in women’s dress. I felt an inward impulse, which drove me to\r\n  the windows of the shops displaying articles of women’s\r\n  dress--corsets, etc. In shoemakers’ windows it was the women’s boots\r\n  and shoes which attracted my attention rather than the men’s. The same\r\n  was the case with dress fabrics, among which self-coloured materials\r\n  for women’s dress pleased me best. Beautiful blue stuffs (satin)\r\n  especially attracted me; also, I had an ardent love for blue velvet.\r\n  As time passed, I felt a desire to possess such things, and to wear\r\n  them. But since at home I had no means to spend in this way, whilst\r\n  the desire sometimes was so violent as to give me no rest, I\r\n  endeavoured to resist it with all the religious and rational grounds I\r\n  could call to mind; yet this was of little help to me, for whenever I\r\n  met a woman clothed to my taste, the longing was immediately\r\n  reawakened. If I met a woman whose appearance aroused this desire\r\n  (which henceforth I will call my ‘costume-stimulus’), I looked round,\r\n  in order to overcome this costume-stimulus, to try to find a woman who\r\n  displeased me. Within me there raged a conflict (which at that time\r\n  was obscure even to myself) between the masculine nature and the\r\n  feminine. One day the feminine in me gained the victory, as it\r\n  impelled me (when my parents were absent from the house) to try on\r\n  some of my sisters’ clothes; but as soon as I had put on the corset I\r\n  had an erection, immediately followed by an ejaculation of semen. This\r\n  gave me no gratification; on the contrary, I was very angry that\r\n  putting on the corset should have given rise to an ejaculation of\r\n  semen. At varying intervals I repeated this attempt to dress myself as\r\n  a woman, and in doing so always endeavoured to avoid anything that\r\n  could give rise to an erection. Gradually I succeeded in this matter\r\n  of dressing; but I was now consumed also with the desire for caressing\r\n  a feminine being, and therefore the dressing alone failed to satisfy\r\n  me. Moreover, this dressing-up also failed to give me real pleasure,\r\n  because I did not possess any costume which really suited me; but\r\n  still, apart from sexual excitement, it produced a feeling of\r\n  well-being. After I had dressed up as a woman, my imagination always\r\n  busied itself with the idea of how beautiful it would be if I had a\r\n  beloved before whom I might display myself unrestrainedly, just as I\r\n  then was. In these fancies I always pictured to myself a girl of my\r\n  own age, with long hair and well-developed breasts and hips. This\r\n  imagination generally resulted in a pollution, which I sometimes\r\n  endeavoured to prevent by taking off the articles of clothing as\r\n  rapidly as possible.\r\n\r\n  “By a colleague I was initiated into the practice of masturbation. He\r\n  explained to me that if I had no woman who would give herself to me, I\r\n  was in a position to satisfy myself. The first time I resisted the\r\n  impulse; but the costume-stimulus tormented me, and I had discovered\r\n  that after a seminal emission I was at peace for a time; moreover,\r\n  when dressing up, I was always exposed to the danger of being\r\n  discovered, and so I began the practice of self-abuse. Masturbation\r\n  did not give me proper gratification, and therefore, after practising\r\n  it, I always experienced a great feeling of regret and also a feeling\r\n  of exhaustion; moreover, it did not produce the feeling of well-being\r\n  which resulted from dressing up as a woman.\r\n\r\n  “I was shy, and was very readily embarrassed in the presence of the\r\n  female sex; I therefore avoided seeing much of women; I avoided it,\r\n  also, on account of my costume-stimulus. It would have been preferable\r\n  to me if, physically, Nature had made me a woman, so that I could have\r\n  gone about freely among girls of my own age. For the reasons already\r\n  given I did not learn to dance; moreover, the turning round made me\r\n  very giddy, and from the age of seventeen and a half to nineteen years\r\n  I suffered from attacks of syncope. At about the age of twenty-two\r\n  years I fell in love with my present wife, who attracted me on account\r\n  of her grace, her figure, and her character. My wife was even more\r\n  bashful than myself. My inclination drew me towards her, but on\r\n  account of my costume-stimulus, I avoided being alone with her. From\r\n  now onwards I began to consider what I could possibly do in order to\r\n  explain to my betrothed my true nature, but all the attempts which I\r\n  made were failures. After six months’ engagement, I left the place\r\n  where my betrothed was living. The engagement lasted seven years\r\n  before we were married. The principal reason for the delay was that we\r\n  were both impecunious. When I was alone with my betrothed, I was\r\n  always thinking of my costume-stimulus. Shortly before we were married\r\n  I told my betrothed in a letter of my peculiar tendency, for I felt it\r\n  was my duty to do so. She could not understand how I could find\r\n  pleasure in dressing myself up as a woman. At first she was\r\n  indifferent regarding my costume-stimulus; later she thought it was\r\n  morbid, an impulse bordering on the insane. I often had to call my\r\n  imagination to my help in order to produce an erection. My marriage\r\n  became more unhappy year by year. My wife, on account of my morbid\r\n  tendency, suspected me of all possible perversities, and was of\r\n  opinion that an individual predisposed as I was could not be capable\r\n  of true, upright love for a woman. How I was to get woman’s clothing\r\n  to my taste I did not know. In my marriage I was no better off as\r\n  regards the costume-stimulus, but rather worse. I had more sleepless\r\n  nights on account of this costume-stimulus than I had had before I\r\n  married. As time passed, I became continually more ill-humoured, and\r\n  was occasionally cross to my wife, which afterwards made me very\r\n  sorry. In the sleepless nights I puzzled how I could possibly manage\r\n  that my wife should not concern herself any more about the\r\n  costume-stimulus, and how I could possibly fulfil my wishes in this\r\n  respect. Gradually I succeeded in winning my wife to my side to this\r\n  extent, that she agreed to make a costume for me, but I must not have\r\n  many such.\r\n\r\n  “My wife was always looking for a reason. She believed that dressing\r\n  up must have some cause, or must produce in me some effect, which I\r\n  was unwilling to tell her. She was continually tormenting me about\r\n  this; she would not believe that I spoke the truth, and she no longer\r\n  felt any confidence in me. She believed that every one must perceive\r\n  that I had this morbid impulse. She endeavoured to learn something\r\n  about the matter from other women. Those whom she asked could only\r\n  tell her evil and common things about men with tendencies like mine;\r\n  some said I must be unconditionally an urning; others that I must have\r\n  intercourse with other women behind my wife’s back; others that I\r\n  wanted to lay aside men’s clothing in order to please girls under age,\r\n  and so on. I suffered horribly from these false accusations.\r\n\r\n  “I endeavoured once again, in an essay I composed, which I entitled\r\n  ‘The Junores,’ to make the matter clear to my wife. By junores I\r\n  indicated men who wished to assume, or who did assume, the outward\r\n  appearance of women in the matter of clothing, demeanour, and figure,\r\n  but who sexually were masculine. All this was of no help to me. Our\r\n  life together became continually more unbearable with the lapse of\r\n  time; often there were scenes which had the most depressing effect on\r\n  my mind. After violent scenes there occurred in me nocturnal\r\n  pollutions, accompanied by no sensation of pleasure; also after these\r\n  scenes erections were for a long time incomplete, so that a kind of\r\n  impotence ensued.\r\n\r\n  “After every new accusation which my wife made against me I avoided\r\n  going home in the evening. I wandered for hours in by-streets,\r\n  overwhelmed by a feeling of futility and vacuity; my nerves all\r\n  vibrated; sometimes I could not keep my limbs still. If I had had no\r\n  children, or if I had known that they would be properly cared for, I\r\n  should have known what to do in such a mood. One thing still torments\r\n  me. Will my children be hereditarily tainted?”\r\n\r\nI have myself seen both of these cases. The men concerned appear\r\nsomewhat nervous, but they are otherwise quite healthy and manly, and\r\nboth deny that they feel any sexual inclination towards men. The desire\r\nto wear women’s clothing, and to feel as a woman, may also make its\r\nappearance as a =morbid= phenomenon later in life, in the form of the\r\n“delusion of sexual metamorphosis” (_metamorphosis sexualis paranoica_);\r\nor it may be =artificially induced=, as among the ancient Scythians and\r\namong the Mexican “mujerados.” These latter are selected as men\r\noriginally =most powerful=, and entirely free from any feminine\r\nappearance, and by incessant riding on horseback and by excessive\r\nmasturbation they are made impotent (through atrophy of the genital\r\norgans) and effeminate, so that there may even occur a secondary\r\ndevelopment of the breasts (Hammond). All this belongs to the category\r\nof pseudo-homosexuality.\r\n\r\nWith regard to numerous historical women-men and men-women--such as, for\r\nexample, the celebrated Chevalier d’Eon, Mademoiselle de Maupin\r\n(immortalized by Gautier in the romance of this name), and many other\r\nwomen going about in men’s clothing, or men going about in women’s\r\nclothing--it is, as a rule, no longer possible to determine whether they\r\nwere genuinely homosexual, pseudo-homosexual, or bisexual.\r\n\r\nI regard, however, the interesting type of =effeminate Parisian\r\nstreet-arab=, described by Brouardel at the Second Congress of Criminal\r\nAnthropologists at Berlin in the year 1889, as characteristically and\r\noriginally homosexual.\r\n\r\n  “At the age from twelve to sixteen years the lad is still small,\r\n  grasps ideas very slowly, and has little will-power. At the time of\r\n  puberty he has experienced an inhibition of development, and his\r\n  bodily growth has remained stationary. The penis is thin and flaccid,\r\n  the testicles are small, the pubic hair is scanty, the skin is smooth,\r\n  and the beard is very thin; the skeleton does not develop fully, like\r\n  that of the normal male; the pelvis becomes wide, and the general\r\n  outlines of the body become rounded (_potelées_) because there is an\r\n  undoubted deposit of fat in the subcutaneous tissues, so that the\r\n  breasts also become enlarged.”\r\n\r\nThis state persists. Brouardel found it still present in individuals of\r\ntwenty-five to thirty years of age. These children of great towns are\r\ncharacterized by intellectual sterility and by incapacity for\r\nprocreation. This type is found also among the well-to-do middle\r\nclasses, and from such, according to Brouardel, the _décadents_ are\r\nrecruited, while the effeminate gamins either become professional\r\npæderasts, or undertake the preparation of _articles de Paris_.[569]\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult, in this description, to recognize true\r\nhomosexuality.\r\n\r\nMagnus Hirschfeld gives an account of a peculiar form of\r\npseudo-homosexuality occurring in an individual who in ordinary life was\r\nasexual.[570]\r\n\r\nThe person concerned was an extremely effeminate and neurasthenic member\r\nof a spiritualistic club, who in his normal condition felt sensual\r\nattraction neither to woman nor to man, but who in the trance state\r\nfelt himself to be an Indian woman, and then became inspired with an\r\nardent passion for one of his fellow-members.\r\n\r\nAlso in chronic intoxications, especially in alcoholism,\r\npseudo-homosexuality may make its appearance, in some cases as an\r\nenduring and in others as a transient condition.\r\n\r\nAn important category of pseudo-homosexuality is constituted by persons\r\nin whom it arises owing to =insufficient opportunity for sexual\r\nintercourse with members of the opposite sex=--as, for example, in the\r\nabsence of women on board ship, in monasteries, in prisons for men, in\r\nthe French foreign legion; and as regards lack of men in nunneries, and\r\nin the case of unmarried or unhappily married women, who supply a large\r\ncontingent to pseudo-tribadism.[571] An account of pæderasty in prisons\r\nis given by Charles Perrier, “La Pédérastie en Prison” (Lyons, 1900).\r\n\r\nIn this category we must also mention the “debauchee pæderasts” for\r\nwhich =truly existent= kind of pseudo-homosexuals I propose the name of\r\n“=anal masturbators=.” These are heterosexual individuals in whom either\r\nprimarily the anus plays the part of an erogenic zone, or in whom this\r\nregion becomes erogenic in consequence of the exhaustion of all other\r\nvarieties of sexual stimulus. Hammond, von Schrenck-Notzing, and Taxil\r\nhave proved the existence of these anal masturbators and the frequent\r\noccurrence in them of pseudo-homosexual tendencies.[572]\r\n\r\nAn interesting phenomenon is the =pseudo-homosexuality of female\r\nprostitutes=. We certainly encounter among prostitutes a number of\r\ngenuine tribades, who owe their adoption of professional prostitution to\r\nthe existence of this original tendency to homosexual love, because in\r\ntheir relations with men the heart plays, and can play, no part (see\r\nabove, p. 434). Prostitutes who are heterosexual by nature may become\r\nhomosexual for two reasons: first, by intercourse with, and owing to the\r\ninfluence of, truly Lesbian associates, in whom the inward sense of\r\nsolidarity possessed by all prostitutes is especially strong; in the\r\nsecond place, in consequence of the antipathy to intercourse with men,\r\ncreated by their experience of life, and striking always deeper roots,\r\nfor they learn to know man only in his brutal sexual coarseness. The\r\ncontinuous compulsion to which they are subjected to satisfy the animal\r\nsensuality of worn-out roués by the most disgusting procedures\r\nultimately produces in them the most unconquerable antipathy to the male\r\nsex, so that all the delicate sensibility of which they are capable is\r\ndirected towards their own sex. The homosexual union appears to them, as\r\nEulenburg rightly points out (“Sexual Neuropathy,” pp. 143, 144), to be\r\nsomething “higher, purer, and comparatively blameless.” They regard it\r\nin a more ideal light than sexual intercourse with men. Women owners of\r\nbrothels also favour tribadistic love, because thereby they safeguard\r\nthe prostitutes in their houses from the influence of _souteneurs_.[573]\r\n\r\nAs J. de Vaudère describes in his “Demi-Sexes,” pseudo-tribadism is\r\nespecially diffused in Paris as a fashionable practice, and manifests\r\nitself here in the form described by Martineau,[574] of a =temporary=\r\nhomosexuality, which is subserved by an extensive prostitution, and\r\nwhich clearly exhibits its pseudo-homosexual characteristics by its\r\nintermittent appearance in the form of spiritual epidemics.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably we have to do with pseudo-homosexuality also in all those\r\ncases in which homosexual love makes its appearance as a =national\r\ncustom= among a percentage widely exceeding the usual percentage of\r\nordinary homosexuality. The typical example of this kind is =the love of\r\nboys of ancient Greece=--“pæderasty,” in the better sense of the word.\r\nSince in this work I am discussing the sexual life of the present day, I\r\ndo not propose here to deal at length with this interesting topic, and\r\nmust refer the reader to the second volume (in course of preparation) of\r\nmy work on “The Origin of Syphilis,” in which I have discussed the\r\nsubject at considerable length.\r\n\r\nSince the Hellenic love of boys was a widely diffused custom, the origin\r\nof which may be directly referred to Crete, indirectly to the Orient, it\r\nis evident that only a fraction of the pæderasts can have been true\r\nhomosexuals. The majority were pseudo-homosexuals. It is possible that\r\nthe custom was first introduced by original homosexuals, and also that\r\nit was subsequently maintained by these. But soon it became a general\r\npractice for a man to regard his wife simply as a “procreative machine,”\r\nand to seek for true =spiritual= love from a youth. Since to the men of\r\nantiquity woman had no soul and no individuality, =the love of boys\r\nappeared to them something natural and morally justifiable=. It would,\r\nhowever, be completely unnatural if for the heterosexual community of\r\nour own time we wished to reintroduce the antique love of boys, since we\r\nmodern men have learned that woman also has a =soul=; that she also has\r\nthe same justification as man for the development of her human nature;\r\nthat she can be, and ought to be, the object of individual, spiritual,\r\nprofound love. I rejoice, that those who are fighting for the rights of\r\nthe genuine congenital homosexuals, that men like Magnus Hirschfeld,\r\nNuma Prætorius, and other investigators, have recently expressed\r\nthemselves in energetic terms as opposed to those whose aim is a\r\nsort of propaganda for the diffusion of the love of men among\r\nheterosexuals--whose endeavour it is, in fact, to introduce a formal\r\ncult of uranism. This movement can do nothing but harm to the just cause\r\nof homosexuals.\r\n\r\nNo one can prize more highly than I do myself a =noble friendship=\r\nbetween men, which at the present day is far too little practised;[575]\r\nno one can wish more heartily than I do that men could speak to one\r\nanother of love, without being exposed to the suspicion of\r\nhomosexuality.[576] In a certain sense I am in thorough agreement with\r\nthe beautiful demonstrations of Heinrich Schurtz and Benedict\r\nFriedländer on masculine friendship as a normal fundamental impulse of\r\nhumanity and as the foundation of social intercourse.[577] But this\r\nfriendship between heterosexual men, based upon natural sympathy and\r\ncommunity of occupation, has =not the least sexual admixture=, whereas\r\nonly in the beautiful dialogues of Plato can the Greek love of boys,\r\nwhich some advocate at the present day, be ascribed to the spiritual\r\nEros.[578] In reality, however, the Greek love of boys degenerated into\r\nthe grossest sensuality, since the youth stimulated sexual desire like a\r\nwoman, and was used as such,[579] so that the originally ideal character\r\nof the relationship disappeared.\r\n\r\nIn the =Oriental= love of boys[580] this ideal element was probably\r\nnever present, and sensual relationships played the principal part from\r\nthe very first. The boys’ brothels of the Mohammedan East were visited\r\nby heterosexual men just as much as by homosexuals. The same men derived\r\npleasure from intercourse both with women and with boys. Bisexuality was\r\nin this case put into practice as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nGerman civilization also passed through an epoch in which bisexual\r\nactivities of feeling were clearly manifest in both sexes, without,\r\nhowever, leading at any time to the physical practice of\r\npseudo-homosexuality. This remarkable period was the time of transition\r\nbetween the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nThe “Sturm und Drang” had quieted down; its fiercely active forces had\r\nbeen controlled; its vigorous will had been pacified, and guided in\r\nconcrete directions; its kinetic energy had in a sense become potential\r\nin two new formative and emotional tendencies of the time, which\r\nprogressed side by side, and, notwithstanding all the differences\r\nbetween them, influenced one another mutually to a considerable\r\nextent--classicism and romanticism. Classicism, under the stimulating\r\ninfluence of Winckelmann, looked back to the “noble simplicity and quiet\r\ngreatness” of the antique, to the beauty exhibited simply in =form=,\r\nwhose wonder Goethe more than any other has made manifest to us.\r\nRomanticism, on the other hand, was the term employed to indicate the\r\nboundless enlargement and increasing profundity of the emotional life,\r\nof which the =formless= is especially characteristic. This appears most\r\nclearly in the work of Novalis, Tieck, and Wackenroder; but both\r\ntendencies meet in the sphere of the sexual. I need only mention the\r\nname of Winckelmann to indicate how markedly the purely æsthetic\r\ncontemplation,[581] and the purely æsthetic enjoyment, of the beautiful\r\nhuman form must have favoured the development of homosexual modes of\r\nperception. We may in this connexion speak of the “Greek Renascence.” On\r\nthe other hand, the romantic mood, the deepening of the individual life\r\nof feeling, the eternal searching for new, peculiar sensations, was very\r\napt to awaken those activities of feeling slumbering so deeply beneath\r\nthe threshold of consciousness, which we to-day denote by the term\r\n“bisexuality.” In Friedrich Schlegel’s “Lucinde,” for example, we find\r\nfrequent allusions to this bisexual mode of perception, as in the place\r\nin which he speaks of a confusion of the masculine and feminine rôles in\r\nthe love contest. When, in so much of the published “Correspondence” of\r\nthis period, kisses, embraces, caresses, and tendernesses between two\r\nmen or two women appear to fly to and fro, it may be that this is\r\nneither to be regarded as purely homosexual perception, nor as a simply\r\nconventional contemporary custom, but rather as the very characteristic\r\nexpression of a tendency to bisexual imaginations and dreams induced by\r\nthe hypertension, overdriving, and artificial increase, of the emotional\r\nlife. Thus only, for example, can we explain the passionate profusion of\r\ntenderness which appears in many of the letters of Jean Paul, written by\r\nhim to men; for Jean Paul was unquestionably heterosexual.[582]\r\n\r\nThe same is true of the women of this time. According to Welcker, the\r\nfriendships of the women of the romantic period exhibited this character\r\nof a Platonic love. Since the dominion of romanticism “influenced\r\nemotional young men in very various ways, in more than one morally\r\nstrict circle, two women friends were so inseparable and so\r\nindispensable to one another that those round them used sometimes to\r\nlaugh at this amativeness, of which, however, a serious suspicion was\r\nimpossible.”[583]\r\n\r\nAn interesting proof of the existence of pseudo-homosexuality among the\r\nwomen of that time is afforded by a passage[584] from a romance by Ernst\r\nWagner (1760-1812), one of the scholars of Jean Paul. The book is\r\nentitled “Isidora,” and in it the Lesbian love-scene between the\r\nPrincess Isidora and her friend Olympia is very plainly described,\r\nalthough both of them at the same time are passionately in love with\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThe last and not unimportant phenomenal form of pseudo-homosexuality is\r\n=hermaphroditism=. It is a remarkable fact that only in recent years has\r\nscience attempted a serious study of hermaphroditic states, which\r\npreviously, as Blumreich[585] points out, were to a large extent\r\nignored, both as regards their social importance and their frequency. It\r\nwas the great service of Neugebauer[586] and Magnus Hirschfeld[587] that\r\nthey drew general attention to these remarkable sexual intermediate\r\nstages, and proved their eminent practical importance, which had\r\npreviously been suspected by no one. How completely the matter had been\r\nignored is proved by the remarkable fact that the new Civil Code for the\r\nGerman Empire completely ignores the juridical determinations of the\r\nformer Prussian Civil Code regarding hermaphrodites, alleging that there\r\nexisted no persons whose sex was indeterminate or indeterminable!\r\n\r\nThe so-called “=true hermaphroditism=”--the condition in which male and\r\nfemale reproductive glands (testicles and ovaries) are met with =in a\r\nsingle individual=--is one of the greatest rarities. By the\r\ninvestigations of Salen (1899), Garré-Simon (1903), and Ludwig Pick\r\n(1905), the existence of such individuals with mixed reproductive\r\nglands (“ovotestes”) has been proved as an actual fact. Walter Simon, in\r\nthe one hundred and seventy-second volume of _Virchow’s Archives_, has\r\ndescribed the rare case of true hermaphroditism observed by Garré. In a\r\nperson twenty-one years of age, brought up as a man, and having\r\nthoroughly masculine feelings, there suddenly occurred, associated with\r\nswelling of the breasts (gynecomasty), monthly recurring hæmorrhages,\r\nproceeding from the supposed intertesticular fissure; also from time to\r\ntime, associated with voluptuous erection of the penis, there was\r\ndischarged whitish mucus, and the libidinous ideas connected with this\r\ndischarge referred always to women. The physical structure and facial\r\nexpression of this individual were feminine; the build of the thorax,\r\nthe shoulders, and the shape of the arms exhibited male characteristics.\r\nIn a right-sided swelling, resembling an inguinal hernia, were found a\r\ntesticle-ovary (Ger. _Hodeneierstock_), an epididymis, a parovarium, a\r\nspermatic cord, and a Fallopian tube.\r\n\r\nMore frequent than these cases, in which naturally the determination of\r\nsex is practically impossible, are cases of =pseudo-hermaphroditism=,\r\nwhich also possess the greatest importance in connexion with the problem\r\nof pseudo-homosexuality. In these cases of pseudo-hermaphroditism the\r\nreproductive glands are, in fact, distinctively male or female, but the\r\ncharacteristics of the =excretory organs= and of the =external genital\r\norgans= do not enable us to determine the sex, for they are in part\r\nmale, in part female, and in part completely undifferentiated,\r\nwhich is to be explained as dependent upon an incomplete or entirely\r\nwanting differentiation of the primitively identical rudiment of\r\nthe external genital organs of the two sexes (inhibition of the\r\nprocesses of growth at some stage of development). Thus there arises\r\n_pseudo-hermaphroditismus masculinus_, in cases in which the genital\r\nfissure is not completely closed, so that the urethra possesses a\r\nfissure below (hypospadias); also the two halves of the scrotum may fail\r\nto join, so that a fissure is left between them, simulating a vaginal\r\ninlet. Since in these cases the testicles are commonly retained within\r\nthe abdominal cavity, or else appear in the inguinal region, simulating\r\nan inguinal hernia, the penis is believed to be a kind of enlarged\r\nclitoris, and the individual is mistaken for a woman (_erreur de sexe_).\r\nIf it further happens that, on account of the supposed inguinal hernia,\r\nthe individual is ordered to wear, and continues to wear, a truss, the\r\ntesticular tissue disappears completely as a result of pressure atrophy,\r\nand the correct diagnosis becomes more difficult than ever. I recently\r\nsaw a case of this kind in a male hermaphrodite, twenty-two years of\r\nage, who had been brought up as a woman. He had, however, always felt\r\nattraction towards women, and, having a large membrum, he was able,\r\nnotwithstanding the existence of hypospadias, to complete regular\r\ncoitus. In the ejaculated semen the examining physician had =not found\r\nany spermatozoa=; but in this case the testicles had doubtless atrophied\r\nin consequence of the wearing of a truss. This pseudo-hermaphrodite has\r\nrecently published the history of his upbringing as a “woman.” The work\r\nis of great interest from the psychological point of view, and is\r\nentitled “A Man’s Years as a Girl,” by “Nobody” (Berlin, 1907).\r\n\r\nWhere the reproductive glands are female there results a\r\n_pseudo-hermaphroditismus femininus_ in cases in which the external\r\ngenital organs of this female pseudo-hermaphrodite exhibit a certain\r\nsimilarity with the genital organs of the male--for example, when the\r\nclitoris is exceptionally large, and the labia majora have grown\r\ntogether, so that the vaginal inlet appears to be wanting. In this case\r\nalso there may be a mistake in diagnosis, and, consequently, the\r\nindividual having been educated as a man, apparent homosexuality may\r\nresult when the natural sexual inclination towards the male manifests\r\nitself in due course.\r\n\r\nIn both varieties of pseudo-hermaphroditism there exist very various\r\nanatomical and physiological possibilities in respect of the\r\nrelationship of the secondary sexual characters to the anatomical\r\ncharacter of the reproductive glands, in respect of the menstrual\r\nequivalents in male pseudo-hermaphrodites, in respect of the\r\nrelationship of the sexual impulse to the reproductive glands, in\r\nrespect of the greater or less strength of the impulse, in respect of\r\nperiodic genital hæmorrhages in male pseudo-hermaphrodites, in respect\r\nof possible sexual aberrations, etc. For more exact details I must refer\r\nthe reader to the works of Neugebauer and Hirschfeld. Here I will only\r\nrefer to a case described by the last-named author, of a male\r\npseudo-hermaphrodite, forty years of age, Friderike S., who had been\r\nbrought up as a “woman,” who at a very early age had exhibited an\r\ninclination towards women =only=, and an antipathy to sexual intercourse\r\nwith men. In this individual a reproductive gland resembling a testicle\r\ncould be detected, out of which there issued a structure resembling the\r\nspermatic cord. In the left inguinal canal was an atrophied reproductive\r\ngland of indeterminate character. The membrum was something between\r\npenis and clitoris. The labia majora and minora bounded a short cæcal\r\nvagina. Internal female reproductive organs could not be detected. On\r\nthe other hand, there appeared to be a prostate gland. In the sexual\r\nsecretion, which was discharged by a different opening from the urine,\r\nH. Friedenthal =was able to detect very numerous completely normal\r\nspermatozoa=, whereby the male character of this pseudo-woman was\r\ncompletely proved, and whereby also the alleged “homosexual” tendencies\r\nwere now shown to be heterosexual.\r\n\r\n  [567] _Cf._ L.

Any\r\n  intimate friendship formed between men in early youth disappears like\r\n  dust before the wind. Then comes the love of woman, which fills the\r\n  whole of our heart; then follows the care for material existence,\r\n  which increases our egoism; and the danger that our heart will shrink\r\n  makes its appearance all too soon. Who draws near to another human\r\n  being? Who admits that he has need of others, and that his life is a\r\n  life without love? We all suffer in this way; we should form warm\r\n  friendships between man and man” (“Berlin in the Time of Reaction,”\r\n  reminiscences by Max Ring, published in _Deutsche Dichtung_, 1898,\r\n  vol. xxiii., pp. 51, 52).\r\n\r\n  [576] Such a noble love between men shines, for example, from the\r\n  letters of Count Arthur Gobineau to Prince Philipp zu\r\n  Eulenburg-Hertefeld. _Cf._ Prince zu Eulenburg-Hertefeld’s “Eine\r\n  Erinnerung an Graf Arthur Gobineau,” especially pp. 22, 23 (Stuttgart,\r\n  1906).\r\n\r\n  [577] _Cf._ H.

In a passage of “Junge Europa” (vol. i.,\r\n  p. 72 of the new edition; Vienna, 1876) we read: “Constantia is the\r\n  most beautiful woman I have ever seen. Outline, muscles, figure, eyes,\r\n  speech, mind, feeling--everything in her is beautiful; she is the\r\n  ideal of a man found in the feminine form. I love this power in woman\r\n  above everything; the soft, the non-resisting, does not offer me\r\n  enough opposition. _Perhaps such women as these form the transition to\r\n  the Hellenic love of boys._”\r\n\r\n  [580] _Cf._, in this connexion, also P. Näcke, “Homosexuality in the\r\n  Orient,” published in the _Archives for Criminal Anthropology_, 1904,\r\n  vol. xvi., pp. 333 _et seq._\r\n\r\n  [581] Goethe confirms this in a conversation with Chancellor von\r\n  Müller, in which he deduces the “aberration” of Greek love from this,\r\n  “that, according to his own æsthetic judgment, man has always been\r\n  more beautiful, more perfect, more complete, than woman.

This name was introduced\r\nby Schrenck-Notzing as a general term for the phenomena of =sadism= and\r\n=masochism=, since these two sexual aberrations are closely related one\r\nto the other.\r\n\r\nAlgolagnia, or painful lasciviousness, if we exclude from consideration\r\nits most extreme manifestations, such as lust-murder and suicide from\r\nlust, belongs unquestionably to the most widely diffused of sexual\r\naberrations; indeed, in its slighter forms it is almost universal. An\r\nexperienced woman told Havelock Ellis[588] that she had known only one\r\nsingle man who was entirely free from sadistic lust; and, on the other\r\nhand, there are few women in whose sexuality no algolagnistic phenomena\r\nare demonstrable. This is natural, for algolagnia, differing in this\r\nrespect from other sexual aberrations, has the =deepest biological\r\nroots=. Its nucleus, =pleasure in the pain of others or in one’s own\r\npain= (the term “pain” being here used in the very widest significance,\r\nboth physical and mental), is an elementary phenomenon of amatory\r\nactivity. “Love is in its very nature pain,” we read in the “Divan” of\r\nthe Persian poet Rûmi. It is certain that we have here to do with an\r\nanthropological phenomenon, one that is normal within wide limits.\r\nAlgolagnia plays the greatest rôle in the individual life of single\r\nhuman beings and in the civilized life of humanity at large. It enables\r\nus to get a view into the hidden depths of the human spirit, and\r\ndisplays to us the remarkable phenomenon of the association of primeval\r\nanimal instincts with the highest spirituality. It at the same time\r\ndebases love, and renders it more profound, and it touches the most\r\nsecret aspects of our nature.\r\n\r\n   “Der Schmerz beseelt\r\n    Und er entfesselt nied’re Triebe,\r\n    Die sonst dem Menschenherz gefehlt....\r\n    Der Schmerz betäubt--er kann beglücken,\r\n    Im Schmerz liegt ein geheimes Fleh’n;\r\n    Er lässt mit feurigem Berücken\r\n    Ein frevelhaftes Bild ersteh’n,”\r\n\r\n  [“Pain animates\r\n    And unchains lower impulses,\r\n    Which had otherwise been absent from the human heart....\r\n    Pain benumbs--but may also give happiness,\r\n    For in pain is hidden a secret prayer;\r\n    With an ardent charm\r\n    It gives rise to a wanton idea”]\r\n\r\nsings Joseph Lauff in his “Geisslerin” (Cologne, 1901). Is there any\r\npleasure without pain? is there any love without sorrow? He who is\r\nfamiliar with the history of civilization will answer these questions in\r\nthe negative. Pain is a civilizing factor of the first rank; it is the\r\nnecessary pre-condition and the inevitable accompaniment of pleasure and\r\nthe affirmation of life. This is the central idea of the philosophy of\r\nNietzsche. The pain of love is only a special case of the great\r\nimmeasurable _Weltschmerz_ and _Weltlust_ (world-pain and world-joy),\r\nwhich move us so deeply in the powerful descriptions of Schopenhauer,\r\nand have always been the most lofty objects of contemplation to\r\nphilosophers and to students of civilization.[589]\r\n\r\nThat love-pleasure and love-pain, the forces of creation and\r\ndestruction--yes, indeed, that love and death (which Leopardi in a\r\nwonderful poem celebrated as twin brothers)--are separated only by a\r\n“thin veil” (Havelock Ellis), was an idea first expressed in the\r\ncelebrated work of the formidable Marquis de Sade,[590] whose books,\r\ntaken as a whole, are merely a paraphrase of the idea of the connexion\r\nbetween pain and voluptuousness; and, moreover, de Sade does not\r\nrecognize this connexion only in active algolagnia--that is, in the\r\n=infliction of pain=, the voluptuousness of cruelty, the so-called\r\n“sadism”--but he recognizes it equally in passive algolagnia, in the\r\n=suffering of pain=, the voluptuousness of being tortured, in the state\r\nnamed after the author Sacher-Masoch, “masochism.” De Sade, who was the\r\nfirst consistent advocate of the anthropologico-ethnological theory of\r\npsychopathia sexualis, himself collected almost all the facts regarding\r\nthe biological roots of painful lasciviousness, and regarding\r\nalgolagnistic phenomena in ethnology and in the history of civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foundation for the understanding of active and passive algolagnia is\r\nconstituted by the fact that we have here, in the first place, to do\r\nwith a =purely biological= phenomenon, which makes its appearance in\r\nevery normal love. The sexual act exhibits to us pain and pleasure in an\r\nindissoluble association. Love’s embrace is a “sweet pain,” a painful\r\npleasure.[591]\r\n\r\nThe nature of the sense of voluptuousness is still rather obscure, but\r\nit is certain that painful sensations make their appearance as its\r\naccompaniment, probably indeed as an actual part of voluptuousness. I\r\nmay remind the reader of the interesting remarks of Edmund Forster,\r\nmentioned on p. 44, regarding the conception of sexual tension as a\r\nstimulation of the pain-perceiving nerves of the genital organs. Still\r\nmore clearly is pain reflected (pain both active and passive) in the\r\nlove-embrace itself, in the phenomena[592] which we previously (pp.\r\n50-51) described, such as fierce embraces, convulsive seizures, grinding\r\nof the teeth, screaming and biting, both on the part of the man and on\r\nthe part of the woman. Lucretius (“De Rerum Natura,” iv., verses\r\n1054-1061) gave a vivid description of the normal sadistic and\r\nmasochistic accompaniments of coitus. In this association sadism\r\ncertainly predominates on the part of the man, though not exclusively;\r\nand, contrariwise, masochism predominates, though not exclusively, on\r\nthe part of the woman. The sadistic “love-bites,” for example, are more\r\nfrequently given by the woman, especially among savage races,[593] but\r\namong the Slavonic peoples it is the man rather who practises the\r\n“biting-kiss” during the sexual act.[594]\r\n\r\n   “Es brausen mir wie Wirbelwind\r\n    Im Busen namenlose Triebe:\r\n    Ich möchte dich beissen, einzig Kind,\r\n    Du süsse Frucht, vor Lust and Liebe,”\r\n\r\n  [“Nameless impulses are raging\r\n    Like a whirlwind in my breast:\r\n    I should like to bite you, little one,\r\n    Sweet little fruit, to bite you from desire and love”]\r\n\r\nwrites Karl Beck in his “Stille Lieder.”\r\n\r\nHow closely these phenomena are connected with the ideas of =blood= and\r\n=cruelty=, and how this connexion is favoured by the redness and the\r\nflow of blood during sexual excitement, are matters previously discussed\r\n(p. 51); and in my “Contributions to the Etiology of Psychopathia\r\nSexualis” (vol. ii., pp. 39-41) I have considered the question at\r\ngreater length. In the same category must also be placed the sexually\r\nstimulating influence of red colours.\r\n\r\nIn association with these algolagnistic manifestations, so long as they\r\nremain within physiological bounds, we do not so much see =actual=\r\nphysical pain, the actual infliction of suffering or cruelty, as the\r\n=idea= thereof, as mental pain; indeed, actual pain is often not\r\nlustful, as such, but only in idea. Eulenburg,[595] especially, has\r\nrightly drawn attention to this mental intensification of algolagnia.\r\nMental pain and tears give a wonderful depth to love, increase passion,\r\nas Goethe describes in his “Stella.” Love needs pain, in order to be\r\nperceived as love. Why? Because pain is something new, a contrast to\r\npleasure, whose eternity would be unbearable. This is described very\r\nclearly in the “Letters of Ninon de L’Enclos,” which, though apocryphal,\r\nare not less psychologically interesting (German edition, pp. 220, 221;\r\nBerlin, 1906).\r\n\r\n  “Change in the spiritual state is important to the happiness of both\r\n  the lovers. And what could better provide this advantage than a\r\n  separation? Have you never experienced the sweetness of a tender\r\n  separation? The disquiet, the commiseration, the tears which accompany\r\n  the departing lover, are they not something most valuable to a\r\n  delicate, sensitive soul? Commonly, lovers regard separation for a few\r\n  days as an evil. But if they examined the nature of their reputed pain\r\n  a little more closely, they would soon perceive that this pain does\r\n  not make a purely disagreeable impression on the soul; on the\r\n  contrary, an entrancing joy lies hidden therein. The pain enfolds a\r\n  delightful charm; and we learn that the heart, however much it may be\r\n  moved with sympathy, always finds itself in an agreeable mood as soon\r\n  as it is able to exercise its sensibility.”\r\n\r\nSimilarly, G. H. Schneider remarks (_op. cit._, pp. 126, 127), that in\r\nall love relationships there arises a need for becoming aware of\r\n\r\n  “the contrast between the pain and the ecstasy of love, by\r\n  misunderstandings, by transient mental torment, by momentary jealousy\r\n  on the part of the woman, or by sportive or earnest threats; and this\r\n  need is gratified instinctively by man, because he feels instinctively\r\n  that love without it disappears or will disappear.”\r\n\r\nHe explains this necessity for pain and sorrow in love as dependent upon\r\na degree of exhaustion, a fatigue of the nerve-centres concerned, which\r\ndemand a period of repose. In the ancestors of the human race, and in\r\nthe lower animals, this repose was obtained by the =alternation= of\r\nquite opposite feelings, such as love and hate; thus the occasional\r\nstimulation of those centres also by which pain is perceived is a\r\nphysiological necessity for the nervous system.\r\n\r\nNothing, in fact, is harder to bear than a succession of beautiful days;\r\nthis is true even of love. Why is it that the very best, unalterably\r\ntender wives or husbands are so frequently deceived? Certainly it is\r\nbecause they often forget that with the sweetness of love it is\r\nnecessary to intermingle a little bitterness, and so to allow their\r\npartner now and again to experience the “joy of grief.”\r\n\r\n   “Frau Venus, meine schöne Frau,\r\n    Von sussem Wein und Küssen\r\n    Ist meine Seele worden krank,\r\n    Ich schmachte nach Bitternissen.”\r\n\r\n  HEINRICH HEINE.\r\n\r\n  [“Madame Venus, beautiful lady,\r\n    Of sweet wine and kisses\r\n    I am sick unto death--\r\n    I yearn for a taste of bitterness.”]\r\n\r\nMental pain as a general sociological, literary, and philosophical\r\nphenomenon, manifests itself as =Weltschmerz= and =pessimism=. Both\r\nmodes of perception conceal intense feelings of pleasure. Schopenhauer,\r\nwho was well aware of this fact, remarks (“Works,” ed. Grisebach, i.,\r\n508) that the recognition of the sorrows of existence, of the misery\r\nwhich extends itself over the whole of life, is accompanied by a =secret\r\njoy=, which by the “most melancholy” of all nations was termed the “joy\r\nof grief.” Admirably also has Kuno Fischer, in his account of\r\nSchopenhauer’s philosophy, described the pleasure to be found in the\r\npessimistic mode of perception; and O. Zimmermann has written an\r\ninteresting psychological work upon the “Joy of Grief” (second edition;\r\nLeipzig, 1885).\r\n\r\nThe pleasure anyone experiences in his own pain, or in that of another,\r\nconstitutes the =nucleus= of all algolagnistic phenomena, and to\r\n=cruelty= as an intermediator in this painful lasciviousness there\r\nbelongs only a secondary rôle. The deeply-rooted instinct of cruelty,\r\nwhich first manifests itself in early childhood, is biologically\r\nassociated with the perception of pain. Various theories of cruelty have\r\nbeen propounded. Thus, according to Schopenhauer, cruelty gives rise to\r\npain in another, in order to diminish its own pain; and, according to\r\nthis view, it is only a means of treatment for the relief of one’s own\r\npain. More illuminating is the explanation of the English psychologist\r\nBain, who derives cruelty from the consciousness of power and the\r\nenjoyment of power, from the delight felt in dominating the tortured\r\nindividual. Nietzsche is the most celebrated apostle of this diffusion\r\nof power, this enjoyment of power in the “superman,” and by means of the\r\n“masterful morality.” He formally does homage to cruelty as a means of\r\nadvancing towards higher civilization.\r\n\r\n  “Almost everything,” he says, “which we call higher civilization\r\n  depends upon the spiritualization and deepening of =cruelty=.... That\r\n  which constitutes the painful pleasure of comedy is cruelty; that\r\n  which is agreeable to our senses in the so-called tragic\r\n  sympathy--fundamentally, indeed, whatever is pleasurable to us up to\r\n  the most intense and delicate metaphysical horror--obtains its\r\n  sweetness only from the intermingled ingredient of cruelty. That which\r\n  the Romans enjoyed in the arena, that which Christ enjoyed in the\r\n  Passion of the Cross, the Spaniards regarding an _auto-da-fe_ or a\r\n  bull-fight, the Japanese of to-day, with his love for the tragic, the\r\n  Parisian workman who has a passion for sanguinary revolutions, the\r\n  Wagnerian rejoicing in the spectacle of Tristan and Isolde--all alike\r\n  enjoy, all alike are suffused with secret ardour as they drain the\r\n  Circe’s cup of ‘cruelty.’\r\n\r\n  “We must therefore,” he continues with justice, “for ever deny the\r\n  absurd psychology which attempted to teach regarding cruelty that it\r\n  arose only from the view of =another’s= pain! There exists an\r\n  abundant--over-abundant--joy also in one’s own pain, in making one’s\r\n  own self suffer; and whenever man persuades himself--it may be only to\r\n  self-denial in the religious sense, or to self-mutilation like the\r\n  Phœnicians and the ascetics, to self-torment in religion, to the\r\n  puritanic convulsive penitence, to the vivisection of conscience, and\r\n  to Pascal’s sacrifice of the intellect--in all these alike he is lured\r\n  onwards and impelled forwards by his cruelty alone, by that dangerous\r\n  emotion of cruelty =directed against himself=.”\r\n\r\nWith a few brilliant words Nietzsche thus describes the principal\r\nphenomena of algolagnia. Ethnology and the history of the world offer us\r\nin equal measure numerous interesting proofs of the primitive tendency\r\nof human nature to sadistic and masochistic manifestations. We must\r\nlearn to recognize the diffusion throughout the entire world of active\r\nand passive algolagnia, making its appearance in the most diverse forms,\r\nin order to understand many occurrences of the present day. In my\r\n“Contributions to the Etiology of Psychopathia Sexualis” (vol. ii., pp.\r\n43-75, 95, 96, 109-113, 120-157, 228-240) I have collected these\r\nanthropological and ethnological data, regarding the universal diffusion\r\nof algolagnia in all epochs and in all countries; and I have referred\r\nto the occurrence of sadism and masochism as affecting mankind =in the\r\nmass=, a fact of particular importance in this connexion. To give some\r\nexamples: Campaigns, gladiatorial combats, man-hunts, beast-baiting,\r\nbull-fights,[596] sensational dramas, public executions, inquisition and\r\nwitch trials, lynch-law as practised to-day in North America,[597] in\r\nthe behaviour of the crowd of onlookers at the former punishment of the\r\npillory, especially also in revolutions, of which to-day once more we\r\nhave the most horrible examples in Russia (_cf._ also the appendix to\r\nthis chapter), in the primeval custom of marriage by capture, in\r\ncannibalism, the belief in witches and werwolves, in slavery,\r\nflagellantism, and the scourgers of the middle ages, the horrible\r\n“satanism” of the same period, gynecocracy or the dominion of woman, the\r\nservice of women of the Minne epoch, the Italian _cicisbeato_, and the\r\nSlavonic sexual slavery of men, asceticism and martyrdom, the\r\nethnological diffusion of skatological, koprological, and urolagnistic\r\npractices, etc. These facts suffice to prove that in all times, and\r\namong all nations, sadism and masochism, in all the forms we still\r\nobserve to-day, were most widely diffused; and to show that they arise\r\nfrom certain instincts deeply rooted in the soul of the people, whose\r\nexistence =even to-day= manifests itself everywhere. Take, for example,\r\nthe following extract from the _Vossische Zeitung_, No. 475, October 10,\r\n1906:\r\n\r\n  “A great automobile race which took place in Long Island at the\r\n  beginning of the month presented certain features reminding us of the\r\n  old gladiatorial games. Three men were killed during the race, a woman\r\n  and a boy were so seriously injured that at the time of writing they\r\n  are at the point of death, and from twenty to thirty persons suffered\r\n  fractures and other grave injuries. From all parts of the United\r\n  States as many as half a million persons had assembled to see the\r\n  races. At the very outset the huge crowd was in a state of hysterical\r\n  excitement. The Automobile Club had taken the utmost care in its\r\n  preparations for the safety of the course, and had shut it off on both\r\n  sides by a net 8 feet in height. This protecting wall was, however,\r\n  torn down by the crowd, which pressed in everywhere, especially at\r\n  those places which the cars were to pass at their highest speed.\r\n  Notwithstanding all the warnings of the police, those in search of\r\n  sensation only tried to get out of the way when the cars were close\r\n  upon them. At a turning in the course there were assembled 1,000\r\n  persons belonging to the best circles of New York society. Every time\r\n  when, at this dangerous point, one of the cars had an accident, these\r\n  people rushed forwards, in order to see as closely as possible what\r\n  was going on; the women screamed and fainted from excitement, while\r\n  the police bludgeoned the people blindly, in order to make room for\r\n  the following cars, and in order to prevent worse evils. =The\r\n  spectators were as if mad with the desire to see blood.= A lady who\r\n  was pressing forward with the crowd, when one of the cars had upset,\r\n  expressed her disappointment plainly, ‘=Oh dear, there is no one\r\n  killed!=’”\r\n\r\nIn an essay entitled “Russia as It Now Is,” regarding the Russian\r\npunitive expeditions against the revolutionaries, the St. Petersburg\r\ncorrespondent of a German paper reports:\r\n\r\n  “These expeditions have long forgotten the political purpose of their\r\n  ‘mission’; they murder simply =out of congenital lust to murder=,\r\n  =from racial love of blood=, =from plainly perceptible morbid\r\n  perversity=. The shooting of boys, the flogging of women, without\r\n  mentioning the still worse ‘punishments’ =which we cannot even\r\n  venture= to =describe=, which take place in the presence of, or with\r\n  the actual assistance of, the greater and lesser provincial satraps,\r\n  and regarding which I have collected extensive material--all produced\r\n  in me, who have been a student of criminal psychology, very remarkable\r\n  reflections.”\r\n\r\nIn these cases, no doubt, the principal cause of the actions in which\r\ncruelty becomes pleasurable is the =powerful emotional disturbance=, the\r\nviolent excitement, which, again, increases sexual desire. De Sade\r\nhimself was familiar with the fact that excitement produced by strong\r\nemotions had a powerful influence upon sexual processes; that it\r\nincreased them, changed them, and led to abnormal manifestations. “All\r\nsensations increase one another mutually.” Anger, fear, rage, hatred,\r\ncruelty, increase sexual tension, and therewith also increase the\r\npleasure of the discharge of that tension. Bouillier[598] drew attention\r\nto the fact that frequently in men, who otherwise have exhibited in\r\ntheir life very genial and sympathetic natures, it is not the desire of\r\nblood and suffering in itself which evokes sexual cruelty, but it is the\r\ndesire for this associated increase in emotions. Similarly, Horwicz[599]\r\nexplains the joy of martyrdom also as dependent upon the powerful sexual\r\nstimulation which it produces.\r\n\r\nA peculiar form of sexual excitement associated with emotional\r\ndisturbance has been described by Charles Féré, under the name of\r\n=ergophilia= (“Note sur une Anomalie de l’Instinct Sexuel: Ergophilie,”\r\npublished in _Belgique Médicale_, 1905). The case was that of a woman,\r\ntwenty-six years of age, who when a child of four had first experienced\r\nsexual excitement at a fair while watching a little girl juggler of her\r\nown age playing with three balls. Subsequently every time when this\r\nscene occurred to her memory she had a sexual orgasm; also when once at\r\na circus she was watching some gymnasts whose performance was\r\ncharacterized by elegance and ease, she had the same experience. The\r\nsame also occurred when she saw a man use a scythe. In a frigid marriage\r\nshe always returned to these imaginations, as the only means of\r\nobtaining sexual gratification. Féré is right in distinguishing from\r\nsadism this form of sexual excitement induced by the view of elegant\r\nbodily exercises. The =generally= exciting view of movement had in this\r\ncase a =special= exciting influence upon the genital organs of an\r\nobviously hysterical person. Perhaps also the case reported by Amrain\r\n(_Anthropophyteia_, vol. iv., p. 242) is similar to this--a case in\r\nwhich a man fifty-three years of age was sexually excited by the\r\nspinning round of prostitutes on rapidly rotating stools.\r\n\r\nHelvetius, Bain, Lully, James, Herbert Spencer, Steinmetz, and many\r\nother psychologists and anthropologists, have endeavoured to explain on\r\n=evolutionary= grounds this intimate association between the emotions,\r\nand to establish an association between cruelty and sexuality. They\r\nsuggest that the gratification of sexual needs is for the individual a\r\nlove-battle, involving the sacrifice of numerous opponents in order to\r\ngain the favour of the beloved being. =In this way there arose an\r\nassociation between the shedding of blood and sexual enjoyment=; and the\r\nrage of battle, as Marro very rightly insists, may sometimes be suddenly\r\ntransferred from the rival to the female herself, and thus assume a\r\nsadistic character. Definite traces of this connexion may still be\r\nobserved among the popular customs of many nations, as, for example, in\r\nNew Caledonia, where the girls are pursued by their lovers into the\r\nbush, and, after they have been overpowered, and after sexual\r\nintercourse has taken place, “they are brought back, bitten, bruised,\r\nscratched, covered with bites on the shoulders and the back of the\r\nneck.”\r\n\r\nI regard the emotional theory of cruelty as the best, because it\r\nprovides the easiest explanation of all the facts; and above all,\r\nbecause it also explains the frequently observed cruelty of =woman=,\r\nwho, as the =more easily excited= creature, displays a higher, more\r\nartificial kind of cruelty than man, whose balance is not so easily\r\ndisturbed by his emotions. Montaigne[600] makes the acute observation\r\nthat cruelty is usually accompanied by a feminine softness. Havelock\r\nEllis[601] also remarks that the most extreme, most elaborate degree of\r\nsadism is commonly associated with a somewhat feminine organization.\r\n\r\nWe might explain the cruelty of women, and that of enervated, effeminate\r\nvoluptuaries from fear and cowardice, from the debasing consciousness of\r\nthe weakness of their own personality, which by means of cruelty takes\r\n=revenge= on the strength of another, and transiently luxuriates in the\r\nassociated intoxication of power, in the mere =idea= of superiority. It\r\nis certainly in this way that we must explain the horrible cruelty of\r\nworn-out debauchees, such as is described by de Sade in his romances.\r\nSuch types also were Tiberius, Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Heliogabalus,\r\nand Cæsar Borgia; among women, Catherine de Medici and those “delicate\r\nCreole women who, after enjoying voluptuous pleasure in intercourse with\r\na negro slave, proceed to enjoy the further pleasure of seeing the man\r\nunmercifully flogged.”[602]\r\n\r\nIn addition, =the blunting of the senses= which results from\r\nlong-continued sexual excesses demands the stronger stimulus of cruelty.\r\nJust as in the debauchee, so also in the prostitute, this blunting of\r\nthe senses induces a predisposition to sadism. Many prostitutes and\r\nmasseuses become sadists quite as much from inclination as from custom\r\n(the latter from intercourse with masochistic clients); and they find\r\nsexual pleasure in tormenting men, regarding themselves as incorporate\r\nideals of “mistresses.”\r\n\r\nAmong Europeans, =residence in hot climates= gives rise to a peculiar\r\nform of tropical cruelty, the so-called “=tropical frenzy=.” The\r\npsychology of this condition is complex. Various predisposing causes\r\nmust concur in order to produce tropical frenzy. In the first place, it\r\noccurs almost exclusively in Europeans who fill official positions\r\ngiving them =very extensive powers=, such as they did not enjoy before\r\nleaving home. Those who become affected live usually in regions in which\r\nall the limitations of conventional morality and of social relationships\r\nwith their fellow-countrymen are laid aside, so that the civilized man\r\nis in a position which enables him to follow without restraint his own\r\ninward impulses; also he finds himself in contact with an “inferior”\r\nrace, which he regards and treats as half or completely animal.[603] The\r\ninfluence of climate is also of great importance, as Hans von Becker\r\nassumes. Owing, it may be, to the intense heat, disturbances of\r\nmetabolism ensue, and by the formation of toxins, the central nervous\r\nsystem and the psyche are injured, and thus there is induced a “tropical\r\nmoral insanity,” a morbid impulsiveness, associated with complete loss\r\nof understanding of ordinary ethical and moral principles. Or, again, it\r\nis possible that, as Plehn believes, the abnormally high temperature\r\ngives rise to acute outbreaks only in chronic alcoholists, taking the\r\nform of tropical frenzy. In any case, this disorder is with especial\r\nfrequency characterized by marked sadistic practices, as is proved by\r\nthe colonial scandals of every country. In connexion with this, we do\r\nnot need any further demonstration of the manner in which the\r\ninstitutions of =slavery= and =serfdom= have always induced and\r\nfurthered sadistic instincts, and, speaking generally, the same is true\r\nof all relationships by which isolated individuals are given\r\nuncontrolled powers over the bodies and lives of their fellow-men.\r\n\r\nA chief cause of algolagnia, of active algolagnia, but more especially\r\nof the passive form, is to be found in the =diverse sexual demeanour of\r\nman and woman= respectively, and this, again, depends upon the\r\ndifference between the masculine and feminine natures. Opposed to the\r\nstormy, eager activity of the man, we have the quiet passivity of the\r\nwoman. The latter has aptly been compared to a magnet which,\r\nnotwithstanding its own apparent immobility, still irresistibly attracts\r\nand holds fast the iron (the man), making the latter in a sense her\r\nslave; upon this passivity depends the unmistakable superiority of woman\r\nin =purely sensual= love. Physical nature alone gives her an advantage\r\nover man, just precisely in the point to which she outwardly appears\r\nsubordinated to him. Thus, among the Indians of Central Brazil man is\r\nofficially lord and master of woman--and does what she wills.[604] Thus\r\nit has always been in the highest grades of civilization also, wherever\r\nsensual relationships have been solely effective in determining the\r\nrelative positions of men and women. The true “=henpecked husband=” (I\r\nsay “true,” because there also exist such in appearance only) of our\r\nEuropean civilization is the man who, from the beginning, has been\r\nsubjected to the domination of his wife in consequence of his own\r\nimmoderate sexual needs; by these needs he has been permanently placed\r\nunder her control, and this control has secondarily been extended to\r\nother relationships. This is the psychological secret of the henpecked\r\nstate, just as it is also of the “=mistress rule=,” which, beginning as\r\na purely sexual relationship between king or prince on the one hand and\r\nhis mistress on the other, later extends also to the domain of political\r\nactivity. The greater the sexual passivity and coldness of the woman,\r\nthe more readily does she gain dominion over the man. A favourite means\r\nfor this purpose is the practice of “=coquetry=” (a matter previously\r\ndiscussed), which can also be defined as the activity of women in\r\nfettering men to themselves and in bringing them under feminine\r\ndominion. The Anglo-Saxon “=flirt=” is only a lighter shade of\r\n“coquette,” representing rather spiritual-æsthetic coquetry, whilst the\r\ntrue coquette makes use of purely =sensual= means, and speculates upon\r\nsex only, without reference to the intellectual qualities. “A truly\r\ncoquettish woman listens with pleasure to the rankest flattery of the\r\nmost insignificant individual; she takes the trouble to stimulate the\r\ndesires of the most contemptible being, although she is daily surrounded\r\nby longing admirers.”[605] Joseph Peladan relates in one of his romances\r\nhow a distinguished lady, while getting into her carriage, intentionally\r\ndisplayed her leg to a poor man standing by, although at the very same\r\nmoment she was coquetting audaciously with a gentleman of her own rank.\r\nWoman instinctively aims at the subjection of man, and voluptuous\r\nstimulation serves her as the best-tried means of doing this. In so far\r\nas man becomes the “slave” and victim of his sensuality, does he exhibit\r\na masochistic disposition; but, in so far as by his force and his\r\nintelligence he overcomes this sexual dependency, and by means of his\r\nnatural activity and energy displayed also in sexual relationships,\r\nbehaves heedlessly and brutally to the woman, who has now become\r\ncompletely passive, does the sadistic element preponderate in him. From\r\nthis we are able to understand how it is that sadism and masochism may\r\noften appear in the same person; they are only the active and the\r\npassive form respectively of the algolagnia which lies at the basis of\r\nboth of them, and in which the true essence of both these phenomena\r\nsubsists.\r\n\r\nWhen in the following paragraphs we briefly describe the individual\r\nphenomena and types of sadism and masochism, we do this always with the\r\ntacit implication that the majority of types are not pure forms either\r\nof sadism or masochism, but represent a mixture of both. This is\r\nespecially true of the most widely diffused of all algolagnistic\r\nperversions, the so-called =flagellomania= (=sexual desire for\r\nflagellation or flagellantism=)--that is to say, =flogging and\r\nwhipping, or being flogged and whipped in order to induce sexual\r\nexcitement=. An elaborately critical account of sexual flagellantism in\r\nits physiological, psychological, literary, and historical relationships\r\nis to be found in the second volume of my work on “The Sexual Life in\r\nEngland,” pp. 336-481 (Berlin, 1903). In this passage there is a fairly\r\ncomplete collection, alike of the older and of the newer literary\r\nmaterial devoted to this topic.[606]\r\n\r\nFlagellation is, therefore, the principal means by which sadistic\r\ntendencies become active, because in this manner all the physiological\r\nsadistic accompaniments of sexual intercourse unite, and make their\r\nappearance with a stronger potentiality. It is an imitation and a\r\nconscious synthesis of these sadistic accompaniments, which in their\r\nmost primitive form are to be seen in the lower animals. Especially in\r\nthe case of tritons and salamanders we can observe a typical\r\nflagellation, effected by means of the tail, prior to coitus. The\r\nvoluptuous gratification during flagellation varies in character\r\naccording as the flagellation is active or passive. The nature of the\r\nlatter is as follows: by vigorous friction and blows, especially in the\r\nregion of the genital organs, and more particularly on the buttocks, a\r\npeculiarly increased voluptuous stimulus is induced by the painful\r\nsensations. Simple =massage= and =friction= of the skin suffices to\r\nproduce such an effect, especially after warm baths, as has long been\r\nknown in the East, and is employed in the so-called “Turkish baths.”\r\nMore especially, the rubbing of the buttocks evokes a =purely physical\r\nreflex stimulation= of the spinal and sympathetic =ejaculatory centre=;\r\nstill more rapidly is this produced by flogging and whipping of these\r\nparts (the so-called “lower discipline”). The painful sensations are\r\nsaid ultimately to undergo complete transformation into voluptuous\r\nsensations; unquestionably the =imagination= must here render much\r\nassistance, and the masochistic element is especially marked in those\r\nwho undergo passive flagellation. The increased flow of blood to the\r\ngenital organs, to which the flagellation necessarily gives rise, must\r\nalso obviously play a part in evoking and strengthening the voluptuous\r\nsensation. Simultaneously also this congestion gives rise to erection of\r\nthe penis; hence the very ancient employment of flagellation to relieve\r\nimpotence, alluded to by Petronius in a celebrated passage of his\r\n“Satyricon.”\r\n\r\nIn the case of active flagellation, the voluptuous stimulation is mainly\r\nof a sadistic nature; the view of the parts quivering under the lash,\r\nbecoming red or even bleeding, the cries of the person who is being\r\nwhipped, the erotic influence of the kallipygian charms, here play the\r\nprincipal rôle.\r\n\r\nThe inclination to flagellation, both passive and active, is generally\r\naroused =by some chance occurrence=, such as looking at a flogging, when\r\nthe spectator finds himself to be in a state of sexual excitement and\r\nrecognizes its cause--as, for example, in consequence of the official\r\nand ritual practice of flogging in schools, prisons,[607] barracks,\r\nmonasteries, etc., also by whipping and giving blows in social games.\r\nEspecially dangerous is the whipping of =children=, whose sexual impulse\r\nis only too often aroused by blows upon the buttocks, and then,\r\nunconsciously, this excitement is in their minds permanently endowed\r\nwith a causal connexion with whipping, from which ultimately a\r\nperversion (flagellomania) is induced. Well known is Rousseau’s\r\ndescription of this connexion in his “Confessions.” I append the\r\nfollowing description by a patient of this tendency to flagellation:\r\n\r\n  “In a similar way to that which you describe, flagellantism was\r\n  unfortunately awakened in me in early youth. This was first developed\r\n  in me by the fact that my parents allowed the maidservants to exercise\r\n  a far-reaching right of chastisement. When I was fourteen years old, I\r\n  still received whippings from the servants, with my father’s knowledge\r\n  and consent; and these whippings, since my father had forbidden any\r\n  other kind of chastisement as harmful to health, took place on the\r\n  buttocks, and were always effected after this region of the body had\r\n  been bared. I still remember most vividly that when I was at the age\r\n  mentioned a maidservant who was hardly two years older than myself\r\n  switched me in this region with especial zeal. I remember also that\r\n  when I was in my ninth year, owing to the free use which the\r\n  maidservants commonly made of their privilege, I had entirely ceased\r\n  to dread this chastisement; indeed from that time I often\r\n  intentionally incurred a whipping by the maids, which was not\r\n  difficult; and from the age of fourteen years I personally gave the\r\n  maidservants my permission to chastise me in the above manner without\r\n  the knowledge of my parents, and was always thrown by it into a state\r\n  of sexual excitement. Such excitement was also produced in me by\r\n  merely witnessing the chastisement of my two sisters, who were\r\n  somewhat younger than myself, both of whom were still beaten with a\r\n  switch when they were fifteen years of age. As regards my two sisters,\r\n  this did not lead to desire on their part that this procedure, which\r\n  was always disagreeable to them, should be frequently repeated, but\r\n  they were always glad to see me whipped; and, as a matter of fact, my\r\n  own sensation of pleasure was greatly increased by their being\r\n  present, and moreover, especially in later years, I always enjoyed it\r\n  more if the maidservant whipped me in the presence of her friends or\r\n  if one of them let me hold her hand during the process. I especially\r\n  preferred being struck with the bare hands, although occasionally I\r\n  endured severe whippings with the stick or with the dog-whip at my own\r\n  special request.”\r\n\r\nIn a second case which came under my own observation, the person\r\naffected being a lawyer, then twenty-eight years of age, the cause of\r\nthe development of his flagellomania was different and more indirect.\r\n\r\n  At the age of eleven or twelve years he was lying on the top of a\r\n  dog-kennel and masturbating, and he had tied his feet to the top of\r\n  the kennel, lest, when in a state of sexual excitement, he might fall\r\n  off. Since then he had always felt an impulse to have himself tied,\r\n  which he sought to satisfy in boyish games (robbers, police, etc.);\r\n  this always induced in him agreeable sexual feelings, which were\r\n  further increased by onanistic friction. At the age of fifteen there\r\n  became associated with this desire to be tied a further need to be\r\n  whipped while he was tied up. This patient has a disinclination to\r\n  normal coitus and to the female genital organs, but he desires to\r\n  receive flagellation only from women. Two successive attempts at\r\n  normal sexual intercourse were unsuccessful. The patient induced in a\r\n  maidservant the inclination to passive and active flagellation, and\r\n  this woman, although she resisted at first, was subsequently, six\r\n  months later, a passionate flagellant. In other respects the patient\r\n  is thoroughly healthy, and has been through his one-year term of\r\n  military service in the cavalry.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the origin of “=schoolmaster’s sadism=,” which is,\r\nunfortunately, very widely diffused, the well-known case of the\r\nschoolmaster Dippold recently gave a horrible example.[608]\r\n\r\nThe teacher or schoolmaster may, at the commencement of his activity, be\r\nentirely free from any flagellantic tendency. This tendency makes its\r\nappearance in the course of the customary exercise of his duties of\r\nphysical chastisement. This gradually induces in him a sense of sexual\r\npleasure. As long as these chastisements are kept within normal bounds,\r\nand only occasionally undertaken, we have to do merely with a tendency,\r\nwith an aberration of sexual gratification, such as occurs in numerous\r\nhealthy individuals, even when they are not teachers or schoolmasters,\r\npersons who seek and find an opportunity for the exercise of these\r\ntendencies in the brothel or with “masseuses.” When, however, a\r\nsystematic flagellomania develops, and the person affected no longer\r\nmerely chastises, but maltreats and tortures, and does this habitually\r\nand with bestial cruelty, as in Dippold’s case, we certainly have always\r\nto do with sadism developed in the soil of a morbid predisposition. The\r\nfollowing cases appear to be of this nature:\r\n\r\n  1. A case which reminds us of that of Dippold recently appeared before\r\n  the Second Criminal Chamber in Hamburg. The accused was a man\r\n  belonging to the cultured classes, who had had a University education,\r\n  had become a reserve officer, and had filled many other positions,\r\n  finally that of the editor of a journal published by an advertising\r\n  firm. The accused lived in Berlin in the years 1900 to 1903. There he\r\n  formed an intimacy with a woman, whom he induced to entrust him with\r\n  her son, for the continuance of his education. Going himself to live\r\n  in Hamburg in July, 1903, the boy was sent to him in that town in\r\n  January, 1904, and was placed in a boarding school. “In order not to\r\n  be disturbed in his teaching,” the man also rented a room in the\r\n  neighbourhood of the school. When engaging this room he asked the\r\n  landlady if there were curtains to cover the windows. On the first day\r\n  on which she visited the room the landlady noticed that the accused\r\n  flogged the boy, and as she did not wish to allow this in her\r\n  dwelling, she reported the matter to the police. After some time the\r\n  woman learned by questioning the boy certain remarkable facts,\r\n  especially with regard to the “educational methods” which the accused\r\n  had carried out in Berlin, and in her report to the police she added\r\n  certain details, which led to the arrest of the accused. The accused\r\n  admitted that he had caned the boy severely, and he declared that he\r\n  had done this only for educational reasons, as the boy was of a bad\r\n  character. In this respect the statement of the accused was confuted\r\n  by the evidence of the boy’s teacher in Berlin, that of his teacher in\r\n  Hamburg, and that of the inmates of the pension in which he lived; all\r\n  of these gave him a very good character. With respect to the mode of\r\n  chastisement, the details of which were heard _in camera_, the court\r\n  held that there was no doubt that the accused had chastised the boy,\r\n  not for educational reasons, but on account of perverse tendencies of\r\n  his own, and condemned him to imprisonment for one year and loss of\r\n  civil rights for two years. It is a noteworthy fact that the accused,\r\n  during the latter part of this period of association with the boy, had\r\n  lived in a happy marriage with a young woman.\r\n\r\n  2. A disciple of Dippold. The following remarkable case was published\r\n  in the _Berliner Tageblatt_, No. 629, December 11, 1903: A\r\n  furniture-polisher of this town accosted boys whom he met in the\r\n  street, gave them some trifling commission, and so arranged matters\r\n  with them that they must ultimately return to him at his room. Here he\r\n  gave himself out to be a detective officer, showed the boy a token\r\n  which he pretended was his official commission, and then gave the boy\r\n  a severe lecture. “He regretted,” he said in conclusion, that, owing\r\n  to the misconduct of the lad, it would be necessary to fine his\r\n  parents, unless the offences were condoned by the immediate\r\n  chastisement of the boy. The “detective” easily persuaded his victims\r\n  that it would be better to accept the immediate flogging. After he had\r\n  stretched his victim across his knees and beaten him with a stick, he\r\n  looked to see that the blows had not made too obvious marks, and sent\r\n  the lad away with a further brief admonition. In most instances the\r\n  boys who had been whipped concealed what had happened from their\r\n  parents; but still the matter came to light, and this new Dippold is\r\n  to be tried for causing grievous bodily harm, and for the false\r\n  pretence that he occupied an official position. The accused is a young\r\n  man, twenty-five years of age, and, with his small and slender figure\r\n  and with a blonde moustache, he makes rather the impression of a young\r\n  man of eighteen.\r\n\r\nVery frequently the tendency to flagellation is at first artificially\r\nevoked in brothels. Hogarth, in his “A Harlot’s Progress,” has rightly\r\ndepicted the switch as a necessary requisite of the interior of a\r\nbrothel, and this simple instrument of flagellation is rarely absent\r\nfrom a prostitute’s dwelling. It appears to be England alone, the\r\nclassical country of flagellomania, in which actual “flagellation\r\nbrothels” have existed.[609] A historical example is that of the\r\ncelebrated establishment of Theresa Berkley, the inventor of an especial\r\napparatus for the whipping of men, the so-called “Berkley-Horse.” It\r\nappears that in England the female sex has a taste for active and\r\npassive flagellation; and we find that a German author[610] attributes\r\nto woman a greater inclination towards flagellomania than that exhibited\r\nby man. This tendency is encouraged by certain male flagellants, who\r\nobtain sexual gratification by the flagellation of women. Guénolé (_op.\r\ncit._, pp. 151, 152) reports the existence of secret places in Paris\r\nwhere young women and girls combine to form a kind of “school,” in which\r\nmale sadists carry out “instruction” with the switch!\r\n\r\nIn connexion with flagellation we must consider the peculiar tendency to\r\nthe =fettering= of the individual to be flogged, who desires to be\r\nrendered =defenceless=. For this purpose various apparatus exist of the\r\nsame kind as the “fettering-chair” invented in the eighteenth century by\r\nthe Duke of Fronsac.[611] Of the same nature also is the impulse to wear\r\nvery tight shoes and gloves and very small corsets, the so-called\r\n“=corset discipline=,” in which the person affected, who may be of\r\neither sex, is laced up very tightly in a very small corset. This is met\r\nwith chiefly in England, especially in association with sexual\r\nflagellation.\r\n\r\nIn comparatively rare cases flagellomania is a morbid condition by which\r\nresponsibility is entirely abrogated; but from the medico-legal point of\r\nview responsibility is impaired or suspended in the majority of cases of\r\nwell-marked sadism, which we have now to describe. To this category\r\nbelong:\r\n\r\n1. =Sadistic Bodily Injuries and “Lust-Murder.”=--The main types of this\r\ncategory are the “girl-stabbers” and the “lust-murderers,” who simply\r\nfor the purpose of producing sexual excitement, or when already under\r\nthe influence of such excitement, inflict on women more or less severe\r\ninjuries with a knife or other murderous instrument. The actual\r\nintention to =kill= is present only in very rare cases. The lust-murder\r\nis, as a rule, only a murder as a =sequel= of a sexual act committed by\r\nforce, the murder being done from fear of discovery, etc.; thus the\r\nmurder has not in these cases anything directly to do with the sexual\r\nact. In other cases we have what appears to be a lust-murder in which\r\ndeath has resulted, contrary to the wish of the offender, from a\r\nsadistic bodily injury. Killing from a purely sexual motive is a very\r\nrare occurrence, of which, however, some very widely known cases are on\r\nrecord--like those of Andreas Bickel, Menesclou, Alton, Gruyo,\r\nVerzeni,[612] and “Jack the Ripper,” the Whitechapel murderer.\r\n[Regarding the Whitechapel murders, see E. C. Spitza, “The Whitechapel\r\nMurders: their Medico-Legal and Historical Aspects,” published in the\r\n_Journal of Nervous and Mental Diseases_, December, 1888. Great\r\nattention and alarm was aroused in Paris in the years 1818-1819 by a\r\ngirl-stabber (_piqueur_). In numerous caricatures, popular songs, and\r\nvaudevilles these assaults were “celebrated,” of which a very rare\r\npamphlet, “La Piqure à la Mode” (Paris, 1819), gives evidence. _Cf._ J.\r\nGrand-Carteret in “Les Images Galantes” (1907, No. 7). Much alarm was\r\ncaused in July, 1902, by the crimes of a new “Jack the Ripper” in New\r\nYork, and by the horrible child-murders committed in Berlin by an\r\nobviously insane sadist, not yet arrested. In a single day he ripped up\r\nthe abdomens of several small children with a pair of scissors.] Many\r\n“murder epidemics” (_manie homicide_), such as the murders recently\r\ncommitted in Sweden by Nordlund, who, though indubitably insane, was\r\nexecuted for them, are certainly connected with sexuality. The two\r\nfollowing cases from German experience relate to typical\r\n“girl-stabbers”:\r\n\r\n  _Ludwigshafen am Rhein, March 26, 1901._--After the manner of the\r\n  Whitechapel murderer, an unknown criminal had for several weeks made\r\n  the parts of the town lying in the direction of the suburb of\r\n  Mundenheim unsafe. Not less than eleven girls were seriously injured\r\n  after nightfall by stabs in the abdomen. To-night the police succeeded\r\n  in arresting the criminal, who is a drover, Wilhelm Damian by name,\r\n  twenty-eight years of age. Five years ago he was suspected of having\r\n  committed a lust-murder on a servant-girl; he was arrested at this\r\n  time, but was discharged owing to the lack of sufficient proof. Now\r\n  the suspicion is aroused that Damian is responsible also for the\r\n  lust-murder committed two years ago near Mundenheim on a little girl\r\n  seven years of age, because the circumstances of that case suggested\r\n  that the murderer was a butcher by occupation, and this applies to\r\n  Damian.\r\n\r\n  _Kiel, November 29, 1901._--It is not yet possible to arrest the\r\n  stabber who, during the last week, has been active in the poorest\r\n  quarter of the town. At first he limited himself to the northern\r\n  districts, and there wounded only women and girls; but in the last day\r\n  or two he appeared, not only in the central parts of the town, but\r\n  also in the southern quarter, where, the day before yesterday, in the\r\n  evening, he wounded a girl by two stabs, one in the neck and one in\r\n  the hip. Since then a man has been stabbed, apparently by this same\r\n  evil-doer, but was not seriously hurt. This happened in one of the\r\n  busiest streets of the town, so that the escape of the criminal is\r\n  very remarkable.\r\n\r\nOther peculiar sadistic injuries sometimes occur. Thus, in the year 1902\r\na printer, twenty-two years of age, was condemned by the criminal court\r\nof Breslau, because in =thirteen= cases he had thrown =oil of vitriol=\r\nat young ladies! Here also we have probably to do with a sadistic\r\ntendency. In the end of October, 1906, in Berlin, a case came under\r\nnotice in which a young girl took another girl to the dentist (!) and\r\n(after previous anæsthetization) had two teeth drawn unnecessarily; but\r\nwhether this case was or was not of a sadistic nature remains\r\nundetermined. But we certainly have to do with sadism in those cases in\r\nwhich men or women inflict slight injuries on their love-partner for the\r\npurpose of sucking blood, which gives them sexual gratification (=sexual\r\nvampirism=). Many =murders by poison= (women murderers commonly prefer\r\nthe use of poison to that of any other instrument) also arise from\r\nsadistic tendencies. At any rate, the majority of professional female\r\nprisoners, such as Jegado, Brinvilliers, Ursinus, Gottfried (the\r\ncelebrated poisoner of Bremen), and others, were unquestionably women\r\ngiven to sexual excesses or sexually very excitable, so that here\r\nvoluptuousness and the lust for murder appear to have an intimate\r\ncausal connexion.\r\n\r\nThe following remarkable case of sadistic deprivation of freedom is\r\nreported by Kiernan (“A Remarkable Case of Fetishism,” published in _The\r\nAlienist and Neurologist_, 1906, p. 462):\r\n\r\n  “Two citizens of good position, of Wladikaukas, in Russia, had\r\n  repeatedly carried off girls of good family, and had treated them in\r\n  an extraordinary way. On account of senile dementia they were\r\n  acquitted of criminality, and were sent to an asylum. The last victim\r\n  was a young heiress, who was kept prisoner by them for an entire year.\r\n  Two masked elderly men fell upon her by night, gagged her, put a\r\n  bandage over her eyes, and drove away with her in a carriage. When the\r\n  bandage was taken off, she was in a well-furnished drawing-room. The\r\n  two old men, without saying a word, gave her a scanty dress of\r\n  feathers, and shut her up in a great gilded cage, which stood in the\r\n  drawing-room. One of them--she never saw the other again--came in\r\n  silence to visit her every morning, looked at her through the bars of\r\n  the cage, often threw her lumps of sugar, and every morning brought\r\n  her a can of hot water, which he emptied into a vessel inside the\r\n  cage, saying, ‘Take a bath, little bird.’ These were the only words\r\n  which she heard. After a year had passed, the man let her out of the\r\n  cage, put a bandage over her eyes, and drove her in a carriage to a\r\n  place near her house. No similar case is known to me in medical\r\n  literature. Everything was conducted Platonically; there was no\r\n  coitus, no exhibitionism or masturbation, either before or after\r\n  looking at this peculiar bird. Certainly there must have been some\r\n  kind of abortive sexual gratification, of a sadistic character, and\r\n  with the limitation that only young girls of good family, dressed as\r\n  birds and kept in a cage, could excite libido. But why must they have\r\n  the appearance of a bird? Possibly in the subconsciousness the idea of\r\n  the bird as a lascivious animal played a certain part. But why did one\r\n  only come and see the ‘bird’ every day? That they must be young girls\r\n  is natural in the case of old men: extremes meet; but that they must\r\n  be of good family suggests a sadistic element, and still more is this\r\n  suggested by the imprisonment.”\r\n\r\n2. =Offences against Property committed from Sadistic Motives.=--To this\r\nclass belong all sadistic injuries not of the person, but of property.\r\nFor example, pouring vitriol over the clothing, of which the following\r\ncase (_Vossische Zeitung_, No. 574, December 7, 1905) is an example:\r\n\r\n  At the present time an unknown man is making the south-eastern\r\n  districts of Berlin unsafe by the use of oil of vitriol. This\r\n  dangerous criminal pours the liquid upon women’s clothing, selecting\r\n  by preference light-coloured fabrics. Yesterday evening he almost\r\n  completely ruined the new light-coloured dress of a young lady who was\r\n  passing along the Hermannstrasse. The offender, who apparently derives\r\n  pleasure from injuring women’s clothing, is of middle height, about\r\n  twenty-five years of age, has fair hair, and wears a fashionable\r\n  overcoat.\r\n\r\nTo the same category belongs =arson= from sexual motives, which was\r\nformerly[613] attributed to a “passion for fire” (pyromania); but when\r\nsexual motives play a part, it is unquestionably of a purely sadistic\r\nnature.[614]\r\n\r\nOf the same character is =sexual kleptomania=--theft from sexual\r\nmotives. Lichtenberg was familiar with this, for he says “the sexual\r\nimpulse very frequently leads to thefts,” and he alludes to the proposal\r\nwhich has been made in England to castrate thieves.[615]\r\n\r\nThe organic causation of the kleptomania so often seen at the present\r\nday in large shops is very frequently of a sexual nature, dependent upon\r\npuberty, the climacteric, menstrual anomalies, etc. Cases of this\r\ncharacter have been reported by Worbe, Gönner, Schmidtlein, Unzer,\r\nHäussler, Lombroso, and Ferrero. The suspicion of sexual sadistic\r\ngrounds for kleptomania may always be justifiably entertained when rich\r\nladies repeatedly steal articles of small value of which they have no\r\nneed.\r\n\r\nA typical case of sexual kleptomania is reported by H. Zingerle\r\n(“Contributions to the Psychological Genesis of Sexual Perversities,”\r\npublished in the _Annual for Psychiatry and Neurology_, 1900):\r\n\r\n  A woman, twenty-one years of age, who from childhood had been\r\n  psychopathic, had from her school-days onwards had a definite desire\r\n  to appropriate certain objects, especially such as were made of brown\r\n  leather (brown shoes), umbrellas, money. Only the act of stealing gave\r\n  her any gratification, not the keeping of the stolen objects, which\r\n  she usually destroyed or gave away. =During the act of theft she had a\r\n  well-developed sense of voluptuousness, accompanied by a discharge of\r\n  secretion from the genital organs.= She performed these thefts as the\r\n  result of an irresistible impulse, and after them she felt remorse.\r\n  She preferred large objects such as were difficult to hide, and it was\r\n  =precisely when there were great hindrances to be overcome and dangers\r\n  to be run=, and when in the pursuit of her aim she was =subjected to\r\n  emotional disturbances=, that the accompanying =voluptuous sensations\r\n  were most prominent=. The psychopathic basis of this condition is\r\n  unquestionable.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these two categories of sadism, which for the most part\r\ndepend upon morbid conditions, we meet also with a =symbolic= form of\r\nsadism, where this manifests itself rather in idea than in reality, and\r\nwhere the person thus affected luxuriates in all possible =fantasies=\r\nof the infliction of pain and of abasement.[616] This mitigated sadism\r\nis certainly to some extent connected with physiological sadism. Thus\r\nthe so-called =verbal sadism= is nothing more than an increase in, an\r\nemphatic instance of, the physiological voluptuous sighing and crying\r\n_in coitu_, whose influence in verbal sadism is increased, and exercises\r\na stronger stimulus, by the accentuation of the =animal=, the =brutal=,\r\nthe =coarse=, and the =obscene=. Verbal sadism is not a peculiar\r\nrefinement of modern debauchees, but a phenomenon belonging to folk-lore\r\nand ethnology, an extraordinarily widely diffused mode of expression of\r\nthe primitive sadistic instinct of the genus homo. In the popular speech\r\nof all countries we find that =abusive terms= and =curses= are\r\nintermingled with extraordinary frequency with sexual matters and ideas.\r\nThe naïveté of this sexual depravity and cursing, with its thousandfold\r\nvariations, shows its origin from the purely instinctive sources of the\r\npopular soul, as the celebrated brothers Grimm recognized when they\r\ndevoted a careful, critical investigation in their well-known dictionary\r\nto the obscene verbal treasury of the Germans. A rich material for the\r\nstudy of the sources of verbal sadism is offered by the _vocabularia\r\nerotica_ of Hesychios; also by the =collections= of local and provincial\r\n=riddles= and =proverbs=.[617] A typically developed verbal sadism is\r\nfound among the Hindus, especially the women. The Indian erotist\r\nVātsyāyana rightly deduces it from the various sounds which are uttered\r\nin normal coitus. In European brothels the verbal sadists and verbal\r\nmasochists are well-known phenomena--men who find sexual enjoyment in\r\nthe expression of the coarsest, commonest, obscene words, curses, and\r\nabusive language; in some cases by doing this themselves (verbal\r\nsadism), in other cases by listening to it when done by others (verbal\r\nmasochism). Such verbal sadists, also, are the individuals described by\r\nA. Eulenburg (“Sexual Neuropathy,” p. 104) as “verbal exhibitionists,”\r\npeople who gladly indulge in lascivious conversation in the presence of\r\nwomen, or who whisper obscene words in women’s ears. Many men visit\r\nprostitutes, not for the purpose of having sexual intercourse with them,\r\nbut merely for the opportunity of such lecherous conversation. The\r\nfollowing case, complicated by bisexual or masochistic features, is\r\ncharacteristic of this:\r\n\r\n  A leading merchant of middle age visits a cocotte from time to time,\r\n  and puts on the girl’s silken clothing, whilst she must put on man’s\r\n  dress; they then go out walking arm-in-arm in dark, unfrequented\r\n  streets, and converse meanwhile in an extremely obscene, indecent\r\n  manner; this alone suffices him for sexual gratification. During the\r\n  whole time he does not touch the girl.\r\n\r\nThis sexual depravity and obscene language can also be conducted by\r\ncorrespondence. Thus we have a kind of “=epistolary sadism=” and\r\n“=epistolary masochism=.” The former, especially, is frequently employed\r\nin the circles of the “masseuses” and “strict governesses,” in relation\r\nto their masochistic _clientèle_, whilst the answers belong to the\r\nsecond category.\r\n\r\nA remarkable symbolic form of sadism or masochism is represented by\r\n=inunction= and =lathering=, for the purpose of sexual gratification.\r\nLathering with soap more especially is a phenomenon with which those who\r\nhave to do with brothels are especially familiar. Either the man finds\r\nsexual pleasure in lathering the prostitute or he experiences\r\ngratification in the passive attitude when she lathers him. Some time\r\nago, in a trial in which a man belonging to one of our leading\r\nmercantile houses was accused, I referred in my evidence to analogous\r\noccurrences in brothels and among prostitutes. This testimony was\r\ndisputed by another physician, who stated that this “lathering” for the\r\npurpose of inducing sexual excitement was “unknown” to him. It is,\r\nhowever, a well-known phenomenon whose existence has been confirmed to\r\nme by colleagues in Berlin, and more especially in Hamburg. According as\r\nit is active or passive, it is respectively sadistic or masochistic.\r\nWhether, in such cases, a defilement of the woman’s person is effected,\r\nas in a case reported by von Krafft-Ebing, in which a man blackened his\r\nmistress with charcoal, is indifferent. The larval sadism consists in\r\nthe =act of manipulation=, in the inunction or lathering.\r\n\r\nAs a last form of symbolic sadism may be mentioned =blasphemy= based on\r\n=sexual motives=, the so-called “=satanism=,” which played a great part\r\nmore especially in the middle ages, and as the “black mass” constituted\r\na peculiar cult, in which the Christian Mass was profaned by sexual\r\npractices, and was insulted to the uttermost. According to Schwaeblé,\r\nthese obscene masses are still celebrated at the present day in two\r\nplaces in Paris. He gives a detailed description of such a black mass\r\nwhich was celebrated in a house in the Rue de Vaugirard.[618]\r\n\r\n=Passive algolagnia=, =masochism=, the desire to endure =pain= and\r\n=degradation= and =abasement= of every kind, for the purpose of inducing\r\nsexual excitement, is perhaps to-day more widely diffused even than its\r\nconverse.[619] The cause of this, which is to be found in the\r\nconventionality of our time, is a matter to which I have previously more\r\nthan once alluded (_vide supra_, pp. 322-324, 467-469). This view is\r\nsupported also by the remarkable fact that, above all, =lawyers=,\r\nleading State officials, and judges, constitute a disproportionately\r\nlarge contingent of masochists--that is to say, persons whose\r\nprofessional life gives them a certain unusual exercise of power, and\r\nwhose profession imposes on them a strict official demeanour. Precisely\r\nthese conditions, perhaps, arouse masochistic tendencies to activity, as\r\na kind of liberation from conventional pressure and the professional\r\nmask.\r\n\r\nThe connexion between love, voluptuousness, and the suffering of pain,\r\nhas already been discussed. In masochism there also comes into play the\r\nimportant element of abasement, a complete self-surrender of body and\r\nsoul, self-sacrifice. The union of these perceptions and their\r\nvoluptuous tinge has been beautifully described by Alfred de\r\nMusset:[620]\r\n\r\n  “My passion for my mistress had become extremely unruly, and my whole\r\n  life had assumed a kind of monastic savagery. I will give only one\r\n  example of this: She had given me her miniature likeness in a\r\n  medallion. I wear it on my heart--many men do this. But one day in the\r\n  shop of a second-hand dealer I found an iron scourge on the end of\r\n  which was a small plate covered with little spines. I had the\r\n  medallion fastened on to the plate and wore it in this way. The\r\n  spines, which at every movement pierced the skin of my breast,\r\n  produced in me the most peculiar ecstasy, so that I sometimes pressed\r\n  my hand on the place in order to drive them deeper. I am well aware\r\n  that this was folly; but love makes us commit many such follies.”\r\n\r\nIn masochism physical pain plays an important part. The “mistresses”\r\nhave at their disposal an extensive instrumentarium for producing such\r\npain, for masochists often have the most peculiar ideas regarding the\r\nmode in which their pain should be caused. Probably unique in their kind\r\nare the two following authentic cases, which my colleague, Dr. D----, in\r\nHamburg, was so good as to report to me:\r\n\r\n  1. A rich Hamburg merchant, known among the prostitutes by the name of\r\n  “Nail William,” had sexual intercourse only with certain prostitutes,\r\n  who had to allow their nails to grow quite long and pointed. They had\r\n  to scratch him on the scrotal raphe and on the penis until the blood\r\n  flowed in streams. One day he consulted a physician on account of\r\n  extensive œdema of the scrotum and the penis.\r\n\r\n  2. Another man had his scrotum sewn to the sofa-cushion with thick\r\n  sail-maker’s needles. He sat for a while in this “fettered” condition,\r\n  after which the strings were cut!\r\n\r\nAll possible cutting and stabbing instruments and burning substances are\r\nused for the gratification of the masochist’s lascivious love of pain;\r\nthey have themselves scratched, bitten, pinched, burned, their hair torn\r\nout; they are trodden upon, whipped with switches or ox-whips; they have\r\nthemselves “put to the question” in every possible way in special\r\n“=torture chambers=” or “punishment rooms.” Such a genuine torture\r\nchamber, in the house of a Hamburg prostitute, was recently described by\r\nthe public prosecutor, Dr. Ertel, in Hamburg.[621] Of the dwelling of\r\nthis prostitute the following account is given in the testimony of the\r\nexamining judge:\r\n\r\n  To the side of the flat towards the bath-room is the door of entrance\r\n  to the so-called “black room.”\r\n\r\n  The walls of this room, lighted by one window only, were covered with\r\n  a coal-black material of the nature of calico, and the plaster of the\r\n  ceiling was similarly covered; to the middle of the ceiling,\r\n  proceeding from the centre of a black rosette, was attached a pulley,\r\n  consisting of the usual rollers and blocks, made in this instance of\r\n  metal, and furnished with a strong twisted cord.\r\n\r\n  In the dark corner between the window and the wall there stood a\r\n  peculiar scaffold, made of roughly hewn planks, consisting of two\r\n  similar parts placed side by side; the back of this scaffold was\r\n  placed against the wall beside the window.\r\n\r\n  The purpose of this scaffold was not immediately apparent. Seen\r\n  sideways, the form of this wooden structure was somewhat like that of\r\n  a heavy, coarsely-made armchair; the upper parts of the arms were\r\n  about the height of a man’s shoulders. To the framework along the\r\n  upper edge there were attached five fairly strong iron rings, which\r\n  were screwed into the wood. The framework ran on rollers, so that it\r\n  could be moved about.\r\n\r\n  On the wall was hung on a nail a leather girdle with buckles; there\r\n  was also a rope about the thickness of the finger, ending in a loop;\r\n  there were also two dog-collars, part of a sword-stick, leather reins,\r\n  and fetters for wrists and ankles, the former being heavy iron\r\n  handcuffs.\r\n\r\n  The window in the wall separating the “black room” from the bathroom,\r\n  the glass of which was frosted, was covered with special hangings. The\r\n  inner side of the door of the room was also hung with black.\r\n\r\n  In respect to this “black room” A. testified:\r\n\r\n  “Z. insisted that one room should be entirely draped with black, as\r\n  the ‘hall of judgment.’ He sent me pulleys from Cologne, by which he\r\n  was to be drawn up and hanged.[622] This excited him, his face got\r\n  quite blue, and it made him ‘ready’ for intercourse. I was afraid that\r\n  it might kill him, and I only allowed him to have it done once.\r\n\r\n  “To the wooden framework in the ‘black room,’ Z. was securely\r\n  fastened, so that he had the illusion that he was on the scaffold.”\r\n\r\nIn all large towns widely diffused =masochistic prostitution= subserves\r\nthe desires of male masochists, and frequently also those of female\r\nmasochists. These priestesses of _Venus flagellatrix_ hide themselves\r\ncommonly under the cloak of a “=masseuse=”[623] an “=educationalist=,”\r\nor “=governess=,” adding to this professional title the expressive\r\nadjective “=severe=” or “=energetic=.” “=Wanda=” is also a favourite\r\npseudonym, which corresponds to the masochistic nickname of “=Severin=”\r\n(the principal character of Sacher-Masoch’s “Venus im Pelz”).\r\n\r\nThese women, the “mistresses,” treat their masochistic clients as\r\n“slaves” or “dogs,” and maintain this fiction not only in personal\r\nassociation, but also in correspondence--masochists are all passionate\r\ncorrespondents. The relationship also of the “=lady=” to her “=page=” is\r\na favourite one (the so-called “=pagism=”). The nature of the\r\nrelationship is clearly shown in the following original letter of such a\r\nmasochist:\r\n\r\n  “BERLIN,\r\n\r\n  “_June 7, 1902_.\r\n\r\n  “GRACIOUS LADY,--\r\n\r\n  “First of all I must sincerely ask your pardon for daring, most\r\n  honoured lady, to write to you. I saw recently a lady with a glorious\r\n  figure and magnificent hips enter your house, and I suspect that you\r\n  are this lady. If you, gracious lady, desire a servant and a slave,\r\n  who will blindly obey all your commands, and upon your order, as a\r\n  slave, without any will but your own, will perform the basest and\r\n  dirtiest services, I should be happy if you would be so gracious as to\r\n  make me that slave, if I might visit you from time to time in order to\r\n  serve you, my strict mistress and commander. If at any time I should\r\n  fail to obey you absolutely, you can treat me most cruelly and\r\n  chastise me most severely.\r\n\r\n  “Will you, gracious lady, deign to answer me, your basest servant, and\r\n  to make use of the enclosed envelope to tell me if you, this evening,\r\n  will go for a walk, and how, and where, in what café you may chance to\r\n  spend the evening, and if you will be my strict mistress, and if I may\r\n  venture to be your slave. Perhaps, most honoured lady, you could be at\r\n  the Oranienburger Tor at eight o’clock precisely on =Friday= evening,\r\n  with a rose in your hand. Full of subjection and abasement, obedient\r\n  to your strict commands, and slavishly kissing your feet and hands, I\r\n  am your most abject servant and your basest slave.”\r\n\r\nSuch a slave luxuriates voluptuously in the lowest services, in the most\r\nloathsome abasements, such as are indicated sufficiently in the names\r\n“=coprolagnia=” and “=urolagnia=.” I have in my possession a series of\r\nletters by masochists full of such things, described with the utmost\r\nparticularity, some even in a poetic form (!), which I cannot print on\r\naccount of their loathsome contents. A sufficient idea of the slavery of\r\nthe masochist is given in the above-mentioned report of the public\r\nprosecutor, Dr. Ertel, in which a “mistress” states:\r\n\r\n  “When I took my meals he lay either under the table, or in a corner of\r\n  the room; I threw him bones, and gave him the remains of my own food.\r\n  He often barked, and usually had a dog-collar round his neck, with a\r\n  chain attached to it. He had given himself the name of Nero, so this\r\n  is what I called him. When anyone wished to come near me without\r\n  permission, he bit him in the leg; this was the first step in a\r\n  slave’s duty. He swept out my room, boiled potatoes, roasted meat for\r\n  me, and did other work of the house. He also wanted to be my horse; I\r\n  had to ride on him; he carried me in this way from one room to the\r\n  other.[624] When he disobeyed me in any way, I had to use the whip. He\r\n  related to me that formerly he had corresponded with a music-hall\r\n  comedian who played woman’s parts, and subsequently had associated\r\n  with him, but he got weary of this, and disappeared for a long time to\r\n  get free from the man. He told me also that he was accustomed to make\r\n  appointments in the Schaarhof (a street in Hamburg in which the\r\n  prostitutes visited by the lowest classes of the population live). On\r\n  Sunday evenings these women have many visitors, when the workmen have\r\n  got their week’s money.\r\n\r\n  “Often I had to shut him up in a wardrobe, with a chain round his\r\n  neck, fastened to the wall of the wardrobe, so short that he could\r\n  hardly move; the door of the wardrobe was shut upon him.\r\n\r\n  “In my flat I had to give him a slave’s dress to wear, in order that\r\n  he might feel himself to be fully a slave. I took away all his money,\r\n  all the keys of his house, of his office, and of his safe, and\r\n  returned them to him only after a night and two days. Z. only does\r\n  this occasionally, when he is utterly beside himself; often he is\r\n  quite reasonable. He does not associate with any decent people; the\r\n  society in which he feels happiest is that of whores and other obscure\r\n  persons; he has himself said this to me. Even the people who make use\r\n  of him avoid him in the street.\r\n\r\n  “He would also learn to dress hair, and how to paint the face, if I\r\n  ordered him. Painted faces stimulate him.\r\n\r\n  “Once he said to me that I might have another slave; this I did. First\r\n  of all I had to bind Z. hand and foot, and to wrap up his head in\r\n  cotton-wool, in order to give the new slave the idea that he had been\r\n  very badly treated, and had been sent to the hospital. When, later,\r\n  the new slave came, and I explained everything to him as Z. had told\r\n  me to, and led him in to see Z., the new man was very much surprised\r\n  to see Z. tied up in this way, became frightened, and soon went home.”\r\n\r\nAnother prostitute reports:\r\n\r\n  “I made the acquaintance of Z. in No. 8, Schwiegerstrasse. He has\r\n  three or four times had intercourse with me. He had himself whipped by\r\n  me. Z. once asked me to fetch a man, which I did. This man got into\r\n  bed with me, and satisfied himself manually, without having\r\n  intercourse with me. Z. on this occasion lay under the bed: he wished\r\n  to do so; I believe he had arranged this in order to obtain sexual\r\n  excitement in this way. Z. and the other man did not see one another.\r\n\r\n  “When the other man had gone away, Z. did the most disgusting things.\r\n\r\n  “When Z. had himself whipped, he first had his hands fastened with\r\n  iron handcuffs.”\r\n\r\nIt would be quite erroneous to assume that in the case of these\r\nmasochistic “slaves,” whose human worth has been lowered to the depths,\r\nwho seem completely to discard their humanity and to sink below the\r\nlevel of animals, that we always have to do with effeminate, degenerated\r\nweaklings. No; much more frequently they are =healthy, powerful men, of\r\nan imposing appearance and distinguished demeanour=, who find pleasure\r\nin playing such tragic rôles, and who obviously obtain sexual\r\ngratification by this complete reversal of their nature. The “slave”\r\njust described was “by nature tall and stately. His features were\r\n=energetic= and sympathetic, and he had a large beard. His eyes were\r\n=clear and bright. In actions and appearance he was a thoroughly\r\nmasculine being.=”[625] In Berlin there exist masochists in high\r\nofficial positions, in appearance and in profession true manly\r\nnatures--“supermen”--who only become “slaves” in relation to their\r\n“mistresses.” According to Sacher-Masoch, Germans and Russians\r\nespecially are inclined to masochism; but, as a matter of fact, this\r\ntendency is also widely diffused in France and England. Zola describes\r\nsuch a type in “Nana.”\r\n\r\nThe slave type is not always completely developed; more commonly\r\nmasochism manifests itself in a less marked degree. There are many and\r\nvarious shades: sometimes there is only a spiritual abasement, exhibited\r\nin apparently trifling procedures and practices (symbolic masochism). A\r\nfew authentic cases will serve to illustrate this--they sound\r\nincredible, but are in fact true:\r\n\r\n  1. A handsome and fine-looking officer, married to a beautiful wife,\r\n  continually associates with an elderly, robust washerwoman, with whom\r\n  he also has sexual intercourse. Since he refuses to leave this woman,\r\n  his wife has separated from him.\r\n\r\n  2. A State official of high position, fifty years of age, visits a\r\n  prostitute from time to time, and puts on her clothing, with corset\r\n  and stockings, while she wears man’s clothing. Then for two hours they\r\n  play cards. At eleven o’clock he lays himself, still clothed, in her\r\n  bed, whilst she must lie down naked upon the bed covering. Nothing\r\n  else happens. He does not make the least attempt to touch her; and\r\n  after a time he goes away, first paying her fifty marks.\r\n\r\n  3. An active Minister of State (!), now deceased, used often to visit\r\n  a cocotte, who had to sit upon him, and then _in corpus totum ei\r\n  minxit_. This was sufficient to give him sexual gratification\r\n  (urolagnia).\r\n\r\n  4. An engineer meets a prostitute (who has been previously instructed\r\n  what to do) in the street, and asks her if he may go home with her for\r\n  twenty marks (shillings). Having reached the home of the girl, he\r\n  suddenly declares with tears that he has only five marks with him. The\r\n  prostitute overwhelms him with abuse, takes the five marks from him,\r\n  and then carefully searches his clothing, until somewhere or other she\r\n  finds a hundred-mark piece! The moment of the discovery of this piece\r\n  of money is precisely the moment when the man has the sexual orgasm.\r\n  In answer to his prayers and whining, to his pitiful request that she\r\n  shall at least give him back half the money, he only receives scornful\r\n  abuse. Finally, she presses one mark into his hand, and gives him his\r\n  _congé_. This procedure is repeated regularly every fortnight--an\r\n  expensive amusement for a man who is by no means wealthy. But he is\r\n  unable to give up this peculiar passion, which for him is the only way\r\n  of obtaining sexual gratification.\r\n\r\n  5. A man of the upper classes, thirty years of age, frequents only\r\n  prostitutes with artificial teeth. They must take these teeth out, and\r\n  he puts them in his mouth and sucks them. He then stretches himself\r\n  upon the covering of the bed, and the prostitute must lay one of her\r\n  dirty chemises upon his face, whilst he at the same time holds one of\r\n  her shoes in each hand. This is for him the critical moment. To the\r\n  girl herself during the whole procedure he does not direct a single\r\n  glance; for him there exist only the teeth, the chemise, and the\r\n  shoes. Thus we have to do with a case of masochism with mental\r\n  fetishistic associations. The previously described medieval “cure by\r\n  disgust” (the exhibition of a dirty chemise) would in this man have\r\n  had the opposite effect to that intended.\r\n\r\nMasochism is much commoner in men than in women, because the latter have\r\nmore command over their sexual impulse, and are not so readily\r\nsubordinated and enslaved thereby as are men. The physiological\r\nmasochism of woman is of a more spiritual nature. Still, in women who\r\nare very excitable sexually a similar “sexual obedience” may appear to\r\nthat which we encounter in men. Shakespeare, in the “Midsummer-Night’s\r\nDream,” when he makes Helena feel herself to be Demetrius’ little dog,\r\ngives her definite masochistic characteristics.\r\n\r\nMasochistically inclined, also, are women of good position who play the\r\npart of prostitutes, either in brothels or in the streets, such as have\r\nrecently been described by d’Estoc in “Paris-Eros”; we may regard the\r\ncelebrated Messalina as their prototype. Similarly disposed are women of\r\ngood position who have enduring sexual relationships with men of the\r\nlower classes, such as workmen, coachmen, etc., and who even seek sexual\r\nenjoyment with any casual member of the rabble they may meet in the\r\nstreets--a practice of which Lombroso has collected examples. Passive\r\nalgolagnia also occurs in women, as is proved by the following letter of\r\na typical masochist:\r\n\r\n  “BERLIN,\r\n\r\n  “_November 9, 1902_.\r\n\r\n  “HONOURED LADY,--\r\n\r\n  “I allow myself to make the polite inquiry whether you will consent to\r\n  visit me once a week, in my dwelling in the Kurfurstendamm, after your\r\n  reception hour. I have a peculiar wish from time to time =to be\r\n  chastised in the most severe and energetic manner, until the blood\r\n  flows=. I am twenty-eight years of age, and widowed, and have a very\r\n  large and luxuriant figure. For the flagellation I would pay fifty\r\n  marks (shillings). If you accede to my wish, I beg you to describe how\r\n  you intend to carry out the chastisement. On what part of the body\r\n  will you whip me? In what way should this be clothed, if clothed at\r\n  all? What instrument will you use for the whipping? In what position\r\n  should I receive the whipping? How many blows should I receive the\r\n  first time?\r\n\r\n  “After the sixth blow my voluptuous sensations increase to such a\r\n  degree that my whole body trembles with sensuality. Are you yourself\r\n  inclined to sensuality, and do you carry out this chastisement from\r\n  purely voluptuous motives?”\r\n\r\nWe cannot determine whether in this case homosexuality plays any part.\r\nIn my “Contributions to the Etiology of Psychopathia Sexualis” (vol.\r\nii., p. 183), I have printed a letter of another unquestionably\r\nheterosexual masochist woman to an “energetic” man.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX[626]\r\n\r\nA CONTRIBUTION TO THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION (HISTORY OF\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ALGOLAGNISTIC REVOLUTIONIST).\r\n\r\n  The author of the following sketch, the Russian anarchist N. K., was\r\n  arrested in Warsaw in the early months of 1906. Like all those who at\r\n  this time were considered to be members of the revolutionary party,\r\n  the intention of the authorities was to shoot him immediately, without\r\n  any elaborate inquiry, after a drum-head court-martial.\r\n\r\n  His demeanour during the shooting of his companions, who preceded him\r\n  to death, and also during the court-martial, showed that his psychical\r\n  individuality was so profoundly abnormal that the Colonel in command\r\n  of the firing-party suspected him to be a psychopath, and on his own\r\n  authority postponed his execution pending further examination in the\r\n  citadel. While imprisoned K. wrote his reminiscences, which are here\r\n  given word for word and without comment:\r\n\r\n  I.\r\n\r\n  My parents were opposite elements: my father, strong, coarse, brutal,\r\n  egotistic, material to excess; my mother, suffering, delicate,\r\n  sensitive, ethereal. From such a cross, a masochistic character =must=\r\n  necessarily be produced. My father brought me up with storms,\r\n  chastisements, and fear; my mother counteracted all this with\r\n  caresses, kisses, and tears.... I =trembled= with secret anxiety and\r\n  =exulted= inwardly at the same moment when my father stretched me\r\n  across his knees. As soon as the punishment was over, he immediately\r\n  proceeded to box someone’s ears--anyone’s, a footman’s, a maid’s,\r\n  anyone’s. I ran with a smarting posterior to my mother. By her first\r\n  my injuries were inspected, then I was cried over, embraced, kissed,\r\n  and finally laughed at and with. This scene repeated itself at\r\n  irregular intervals. To these years belong my first memory of the\r\n  masochistic principle of life. This was based upon the following\r\n  observations:\r\n\r\n  All my companions, boys and girls alike, endeavoured to play tricks on\r\n  one another; to tell tales of one another to their parents, tales true\r\n  and false; in every way to cause suffering, in order then, by\r\n  redoubled love, to make all right again. On the other hand, I noticed\r\n  that no child loved another unless it was tormented by that other.\r\n  Those who did not torment one another were mutually indifferent.\r\n\r\n  This mutual tormenting and =being= tormented must therefore, =in the\r\n  nature of things=, produce a certain charm, gives rise to a\r\n  =pleasure=. This pleasure consisted in increasing, mentally realizing,\r\n  =sympathizing= with, the pain of another. This is =not\r\n  sadism=--generally speaking, sadism does not exist--it is only\r\n  =refined masochism=; for we prepare pains in order to sympathize with\r\n  them--that is, in order that we may free =ourselves=.\r\n\r\n  I especially enjoyed teasing girls, destroying their toys, tearing\r\n  their dolls to pieces, dirtying their clothing, etc. When, thereupon,\r\n  they wept bitterly, I fought against their tears, until finally they\r\n  were consoled. Then I went close to them, embraced them, caressed\r\n  them, kissed them, and cried with sympathy. What pain and what\r\n  pleasure did I experience when they pushed me away, struck me, and\r\n  spat in my face! I bought them once more finer toys, and was =so\r\n  happy= when their tears gave place to laughter!\r\n\r\n  How often I told false tales of other children to their parents, in\r\n  order to be able to sympathize with the mental pain of an undeserved\r\n  chastisement! But I was no exception in this, because most of my\r\n  playmates were the same. I remember how a girl of eleven calumniated a\r\n  boy of twelve: she declared that he had put his hand on her private\r\n  parts when she was out walking! The happy, poor lad was frightfully\r\n  beaten at school and at home. All the children baited him, despised\r\n  him, and avoided him like the plague.... He became quite afraid of his\r\n  fellows.\r\n\r\n  What did I live through at that time?\r\n\r\n  Moody and spiteful, he lay under a tree; the girl who had told this\r\n  false tale about him softly drew near, stood by him, and with a\r\n  pleading voice called his name. Furiously he jumped to his feet, and\r\n  wished to run away; but she seized his hand, fell upon her knees, and\r\n  begged for his forgiveness. It was useless for him to abuse her, to\r\n  strike her, and to tread upon her toes. She threw her arms round him,\r\n  cried as if her heart was broken, and spoke tenderly to him for so\r\n  long a time, until at last he sat down beside her, and allowed himself\r\n  to be caressed. Thus they sat together for a long time, and wept and\r\n  laughed and wept. Suddenly she seized his hand and pressed it\r\n  violently between her thighs....\r\n\r\n  This contact formed the last link of a long logical chain....\r\n\r\n  These were the =facts= which first made me feel instinctively how,\r\n  like every fundamental thing--everything which is of a primeval\r\n  character: primeval force, primeval matter, primeval impulse,\r\n  etc.--all represent the union of two extremes; the primeval impulse\r\n  “love” can also be the coalescence of two opposites. These two\r\n  opposites in =this= case are pleasure and pain; as in the case of\r\n  electricity we have the union of the two opposites, positive and\r\n  negative electricity; in the case of magnetism, we have the union of\r\n  positive and negative magnetism; in the case of the atom, the positive\r\n  and negative ion; in the case of sex, man and woman, etc.\r\n\r\n  II.\r\n\r\n  My years of school and University life were spent at St. Petersburg.\r\n  Tempestuously I threw myself upon simple physical “love” (!), upon the\r\n  orgies, upon all the varieties, of physical love. Bodily-sexual\r\n  masochism, with all its artificial sensual charms, was a cup which I\r\n  drained to the dregs; but I was never able to explain to myself why\r\n  humanity was satisfied with so crude a definition of the idea of\r\n  “masochism.” Sexual masochism is indeed one of the most obvious facts\r\n  of life. But the same is true also of sexual love; and yet we do not\r\n  maintain that love is only sexual impulse.\r\n\r\n  I passed beyond this physical masochism; it was for me a necessary\r\n  phase of development. =The spiritual element within me began to sway\r\n  my existence.= At this time I learned to love a girl of a wonderful\r\n  character. She loved me to a similar degree of insanity.\r\n\r\n  Had I been a beggar or a tramp, she would have followed me through the\r\n  streets. She would have accompanied me to forced labour in Kara,\r\n  Kamtchatka, or Saghalien. For me she would also have mounted the\r\n  scaffold; to save me she would even have become a prostitute. It was a\r\n  blessedness to love her and to be loved by her.\r\n\r\n  How can we wonder that in conformity with this interminable love\r\n  accompanying sorrows should also extend into infinity, and ultimately\r\n  lead to a catastrophe?\r\n\r\n  Every night we slept together, although for months at a time we did\r\n  not have sexual intercourse; we embraced one another so closely and\r\n  slept =so gently=!...\r\n\r\n  To separate from one another only for a few hours was a torment. If I\r\n  went out alone, I must tell her the precise moment at which she might\r\n  expect me to return. If I remained away a quarter of an hour longer,\r\n  Mascha at once pictured to herself that I had been run over by a tram,\r\n  that I had fallen down in an epileptic fit, that I had suddenly become\r\n  insane and jumped into the Neva, or that some other disaster had\r\n  befallen to me. Thus she stood continually at the window, in order to\r\n  see what was passing in the street. If anyone came up to our floor,\r\n  she ran quickly to see who it was. If it was not I, then she felt\r\n  horrible anxiety. When at length I came, she stood waiting for me in\r\n  the doorway, laughing and crying at the same time. Then there followed\r\n  embraces and kisses as if I had returned from a journey to the North\r\n  Pole; but also reproaches, such as, “You do not love me at all; if you\r\n  did you would not torture me so! You know how anxious I always am\r\n  about you when you are away!”\r\n\r\n  Gradually I began to understand this condition, =as an inevitable\r\n  consequence of the masochistic principle of love=.\r\n\r\n  =This martyrdom of the soul, which lovers prepare for themselves in\r\n  the unceasing dread of losing one another, or of losing one another’s\r\n  love, is intimately connected with the very nature of love. Without\r\n  anxiety of this kind, love would be unthinkable. He who loves must\r\n  continually torment himself with this anxiety; and the stronger the\r\n  love, the greater is this torment. When the torment is increased by\r\n  the other’s participation in it, the mutual love is also increased\r\n  thereby.=\r\n\r\n  This necessity we also felt, and we resolved to procreate an\r\n  illegitimate child.\r\n\r\n  What this step meant to us--members of leading families--can readily\r\n  be understood; but we proudly resolved to defy society at large, in\r\n  order to consecrate our love by the sorrows which this would entail.\r\n\r\n  III.\r\n\r\n  As soon as Mascha became pregnant, I felt an irresistible impulse to\r\n  increase our mutual torments! To increase them!! To increase them!!!\r\n  For our love did not appear to me sufficiently great, nor yet\r\n  sufficiently worthy, nor yet sufficiently holy, for us to crystallize\r\n  ourselves in a new living being.\r\n\r\n  This idea racked me continually. In vain I sought to convince myself\r\n  that our love was a million times greater than the love of ordinary\r\n  mortals, that it was unique!... Again and again my conscience said to\r\n  me: “How can you use for =yourself= the measuring rule of ordinary\r\n  men, even if they are the leaders of men? You are the =conscious=\r\n  masochist! Your =ideals= must be suited to this fact! Is it anything\r\n  so much out of the common to have an illegitimate child? You must\r\n  increase your sorrows! Increase them!!”\r\n\r\n  (He proceeds to describe how in every possible way he tormented his\r\n  beloved.)\r\n\r\n  At length, in consequence of my continued vexation, Mascha became as\r\n  nervous as =I= was myself.... Now she really began to take everything\r\n  perversely.\r\n\r\n  “Leave me in peace! It is your fault! You are driving me quite out of\r\n  my mind!!”\r\n\r\n  On account of the most trifling matters we became furious with rage,\r\n  mutually making one another more wretched and more bitter. Ten, twenty\r\n  times a day, we stood facing one another, leaning forwards, shaking\r\n  with wrath, our mouths gaping with anger, our eyes sparkling, our\r\n  fingers widely separated, like tigers ready to spring; many times she\r\n  struck me in the face or spat at me!\r\n\r\n  “Oh, you wretch! How I hate you!!! I should like--I should like----!”\r\n\r\n  Then we said to one another calmly and quietly that we did not suit\r\n  one another; that we had been deceived; that everything was now at an\r\n  end; we begged one another for forgiveness, and separated.\r\n\r\n  Soon came the pangs of conscience, the question, “Who is to blame?”\r\n  Now the pains began: “What have I done? It is impossible that it =can=\r\n  be so; I will beg her forgiveness upon my knees. She must be =mine=\r\n  again--must be, must be!”\r\n\r\n  “Oh, love, love! How interminable is your pain!”\r\n\r\n  Now I began with nervous haste to say to myself, “Where will she be?\r\n  With Katja? Up! Go to her and ask her!”\r\n\r\n  “Has Mascha been here?”\r\n\r\n  “Yes--she has just gone away!”\r\n\r\n  “Did she not say where she was going?”\r\n\r\n  “No!... Have you quarrelled once more?”\r\n\r\n  “H’m!... A little, but it was my fault!... I must find her!...\r\n  Good-bye!”\r\n\r\n  At the house of A, B, C, and D she was not to be found. Is it possible\r\n  that in her pain----? No, no! Not =that=! Not =that=!!\r\n\r\n  This pulsed in my temples, whilst I ran up and down the stairs!\r\n\r\n  Six o’clock! now she will go out walking on the Newsky-Prospekt!!...\r\n\r\n  At last I reach the Newsky-Prospekt! I rush up and down looking for\r\n  her! Is that she? No! Or there? It is not she! That must be she?\r\n  No--yes--no--yes, yes!... It is she.... Now walk a little more\r\n  slowly.... Now she sees me.... She turns as if to pass by on the other\r\n  side.... She changes her mind and stays on this side....\r\n\r\n  “Have you been out walking long?”...\r\n\r\n  Mascha lies in my arms. We cry and laugh--cry and laugh.... Never,\r\n  never, never again!!... Forgive, forgive!!... We embrace one another,\r\n  press one another, kiss one another, as if we could be absorbed into\r\n  one another.... We abuse one another, pull one another’s hair, and\r\n  playfully box one another’s ears.... Then we rub our cheeks together,\r\n  and give one another the maddest pet names....\r\n\r\n  Oh, paradise of love! Why did I quarrel with my fate which imposed\r\n  upon me such unheard-of torments?... Nothing else could have brought\r\n  me such blessedness as this!!\r\n\r\n  Oh, fate! More, more, still more martyrdom!... In this way let my love\r\n  grow!\r\n\r\n  IV.\r\n\r\n  Our life together became continually more intolerable, and yet we\r\n  could not bear to be away from one another a single hour. A terrible\r\n  fate chained us together, and threw us into the maelstrom of this\r\n  furious impulse, irresistible in its elemental force. To tear\r\n  ourselves apart was rendered impossible by the fetters that chained us\r\n  together.\r\n\r\n  Continually more frightful, continually more insane, became our\r\n  scenes, and the love-eruptions which broke out from time to time.\r\n\r\n  (After mutual spiritual torments, becoming ever worse and worse, K.\r\n  begs his beloved to procure abortion!)\r\n\r\n  She wept quietly, then kissed me and went out....\r\n\r\n  The key grated in the lock....\r\n\r\n  “Mascha! Mascha! For God’s sake! Mascha! What are you going to do?...”\r\n\r\n  I shook the door like a madman.... It would not give way.... I tore\r\n  open the window.... “Help! Help!”... The door was burst open.... Break\r\n  open Mascha’s door!... It was quickly forced.... She lies there....\r\n  Dead.... Poison....\r\n\r\n  V.\r\n\r\n  Finally--after weeks--I was once more somewhat calmer, and was able to\r\n  think a little. I had so utterly lost all power that I was only able\r\n  to get from my bed to the sofa, or back again, with assistance. They\r\n  had been afraid that I should not get over it at all.... Week after\r\n  week to endure the most shattering, superhuman sorrows, to oscillate\r\n  between death and madness!...\r\n\r\n  But superhuman =love= had also been mine! The statue of Saïs had been\r\n  unveiled to me!... I had quaffed the cup of love to the =last=\r\n  dregs!... But he only will have had this experience who has first\r\n  drunk to the dregs the draught of =sorrow=!...\r\n\r\n  Oh, short-sighted world, which will call the murder of Mascha\r\n  “sadism”!... Had not her pains cut twice as deeply into =my own=\r\n  heart? Has not =my= soul been convulsed by her torment?... I wished\r\n  only to torture =myself=!... Am I to blame that it was only possible\r\n  to do so through her martyrdom?... Has not =she= shared also all my\r\n  superearthly blisses?... He who has experienced =this= does not\r\n  regret--even if he must pay =double= the price in sorrows!!\r\n\r\n  Is not that “=masochism=”?\r\n\r\n  Have you who wished to pass judgment on me learned that? No! Who will\r\n  set up to be a judge of a case of which he knows nothing?\r\n\r\n  Oh, crude psychology, which teaches that out of an =inhuman=\r\n  impulse--out of cruelty--we commit “crimes” on those nearest to us!\r\n  Only from a purely =human= impulse--from “love”--do we do to the\r\n  nearest to us what you call “crimes,” in order that he may share that\r\n  unnamable happiness which we ourselves feel. Thus the influences which\r\n  move us are purely =ethical=.\r\n\r\n  Do you believe that we only are masochists? Or do you believe that\r\n  those only are masochists who have themselves trodden on by a\r\n  prostitute, have had their ears boxed, have been whipped, befouled,\r\n  and have let the prostitute spit in their faces?\r\n\r\n  Oh, idiots! I say to you all love is masochistic, and all which leads\r\n  to it is associated with it, or results from it, bears the imprint\r\n  “pleasure and pain.”\r\n\r\n  Nature =never= fails. Who, then, believes that it was caprice, chance,\r\n  or irony, on Nature’s part, when she associated =love= with so much\r\n  =torment=?\r\n\r\n  Who does not think of all the tragedies of =unhappy= love, with its\r\n  murders and suicides, all its physical and spiritual martyrdom, which\r\n  every day brings to us?\r\n\r\n  Who does not think of the tragedy of sexual love which is offered to\r\n  us in the hospitals? all the hundreds of thousands who have to pay for\r\n  the licentiousness which results from sexual =lust=--all the tabetics,\r\n  syphilitics, general paralytics, etc.?\r\n\r\n  Who does not remember the torments which the sexually perverse have\r\n  brought on themselves and on humanity? All the =lust-murders=! And all\r\n  the punitive measures? The lust-murders which we commit--to prevent\r\n  lust-murders!...\r\n\r\n  Who does not think of the torments of pregnancy? its risks of life and\r\n  death?\r\n\r\n  Are all these mistakes of Nature? No! No!! The accompaniment of\r\n  pleasure by pain must have some definite purpose. This purpose is:\r\n  =That pleasure, without its opposite, pain, would not be perceptible,\r\n  would be unthinkable, would be inconceivable--just as cold could not\r\n  be apparent to our consciousness without heat, or light without\r\n  darkness. Thus pleasure, in the absence of pain, would not be\r\n  perceived as pleasure. Therefore, by increase of pain, pleasure\r\n  becomes of greater value, for the greater the contrast the more\r\n  readily do we perceive it.=\r\n\r\n  “=Masochism is thus a natural law.=”\r\n\r\n  =The more fully it is developed in any individual, the higher, the\r\n  more superhuman is that person.=\r\n\r\n  VI.\r\n\r\n  Through the recognition of the masochistic natural law, I passed into\r\n  a peculiar condition. Individual love and sorrow no longer made any\r\n  particular impression on me. I began to observe masochism in the life\r\n  and work of Nature, in the history of humanity, in social life, and in\r\n  civilization.\r\n\r\n  Is not the great developmental principle of Nature based upon\r\n  this--that the existence and progress of the species is dependent upon\r\n  pressure exercised on it by its environment? The more difficult the\r\n  conditions of existence, the harder the pressure of the environment,\r\n  the more =suffering= the species has to bear, the stronger must be the\r\n  reaction against these, the more strongly will the powers and\r\n  capacities of that species become active, and by this the species will\r\n  be elevated to a higher level.\r\n\r\n  “=Thus suffering is the driving force of Nature. Nature is therefore\r\n  masochistic!=”\r\n\r\n  Within the species itself the same law holds. Within the “human”\r\n  species have not those varieties developed to the highest which have\r\n  had to overcome the =hardest= environment? Those who by nature have\r\n  been troubled with the greatest difficulties in providing for their\r\n  food-supply? Those who have =suffered= most?\r\n\r\n  Is not the existence of the living being dependent upon the “struggle\r\n  for existence,” upon the mutual hostility of the species, striving for\r\n  one another’s annihilation?\r\n\r\n  It is a characteristic trait of human nature that all religions are\r\n  based upon the same fundamental principle: “Only by =suffering= canst\r\n  thou become happy!”\r\n\r\n  Is not this true =masochism=, when humanity, by means of modern\r\n  science, has also been robbed of the hope of a beyond, of the hope for\r\n  eternity and blessedness, and is offered =nothing= in its place? Look\r\n  at universal history!\r\n\r\n  Was not the birth of that great idea associated with frightful\r\n  sufferings, with the influence of fire and sword, blood and death? Has\r\n  not humanity crucified its greatest benefactors? Has it not rewarded\r\n  them with the gallows, the torture-chamber, the wheel, the stake, the\r\n  prison, and the asylum?\r\n\r\n  And all out of =love for humanity=!\r\n\r\n  All the persecutions of Christians and Jews, the inquisitions and\r\n  burnings of heretics, witch-trials, the religious sorrows of all\r\n  times--all were outflows of the =love for humanity=. Their aim was to\r\n  safeguard mankind from the robbery of its happiness by heresy!\r\n\r\n  The love of humanity begat our Neros, our Torquemadas, our Ivans the\r\n  Terrible, and Schdanows!\r\n\r\n  Why did these men torture other men?... In order =themselves= to\r\n  realize in imagination the others’ torments, to sympathize with them,\r\n  to feel with them. In order in their own spirit to endure these\r\n  martyrdoms; that is to say, to torture themselves with the\r\n  representation of the pain of another.... “=Thus in its motives sadism\r\n  is nothing else than masochism.=”\r\n\r\n  The =love of humanity= erected the cross of Christ, lighted the\r\n  faggots with which Huss and Bruno wore burned, tortured Thomas\r\n  Münzer, stabbed Marat, decapitated Hebert, and built the gallows of\r\n  Arad, St. Petersburg, Chicago, etc.!\r\n\r\n  The =love of humanity= built the Bastille, the Tower of London, the\r\n  Spielberg, Blackwell’s Island, and the Schlüsselburg, built the\r\n  torture-chambers of the Inquisition, constructed the medieval penal\r\n  system, and those of Montjuich, Alcalla del Valle, Borissoglebsk, and\r\n  many others.\r\n\r\n  Remarkable! That precisely your “love of humanity” was the most cruel\r\n  tormentor, the most inexorable executioner, the most bloodthirsty\r\n  butcher of men, and the greatest of all criminals.\r\n\r\n  =Do you not see in all this the wise rule of the masochistic\r\n  principle? That it was only persecution which diffused these ideas?=\r\n  All the progress which man makes in =civilization= must be paid for by\r\n  means of enormous sacrifice. The superhuman sorrows of millions of\r\n  slaves created the civilization of antiquity--the Phœnician, the\r\n  Babylonian, the Persian, the Assyrian, the Greek, and the Roman! (With\r\n  regard to this often disputed fact, see Mommsen: “In comparison with\r\n  the sufferings of the slaves of antiquity, all the sufferings of\r\n  modern negro slaves are simply a drop in the ocean!”)\r\n\r\n  =Indian= civilization is the product of the most horrible suppression\r\n  and plunder of the lower castes by the higher. The soil of the\r\n  Southern States of America was cultivated through being manured with\r\n  the sweat, blood, and bones of negro slaves.\r\n\r\n  The soil of Europe, again, was made fertile by the sufferings of\r\n  slaves and serfs, and so on!\r\n\r\n  Amid the most horrible birth-pangs, amid the slave rebellions, peasant\r\n  wars, and revolutions, in the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth\r\n  centuries, mankind was enabled to throw off the shell of the feudal\r\n  system. Therewith capitalism was born. This newest form of\r\n  civilization, once more, is based upon horrible plundering,\r\n  oppression, and misery of millions and millions of proletarians.\r\n\r\n  What a devastation of humanity results from the acquirements of\r\n  civilization in respect of engineering and the practical arts!...\r\n  Every invention and discovery demands its victims!...\r\n\r\n  How often have chemists been destroyed by an explosion in the creation\r\n  of new compounds, or killed by the development of poisonous vapours!\r\n\r\n  Count the engineers who have been sacrificed to their profession, or\r\n  bacteriologists who have been killed through infection in the study of\r\n  zymotic diseases!\r\n\r\n  Count all the victims of professional diseases, of tuberculosis,\r\n  phosphorus necrosis, lead poisoning, mercurial poisoning, etc.!...\r\n  Count all those who have fallen from scaffoldings, all the sailors who\r\n  have been drowned, all the railway employees who have been run over,\r\n  all the factory hands who have been torn to pieces by machinery, all\r\n  those who have been destroyed in mines by explosions, etc.!\r\n\r\n  Think of the hunger and misery of the widows and children of these\r\n  victims of industry and science, of the loss of work and other social\r\n  injuries resulting from capitalism!\r\n\r\n  The rebellion of the victims of this system, again, gives rise to the\r\n  class war, with new tortures, new sufferings!... In order ultimately,\r\n  by the creation of a new social system in the future, to free mankind\r\n  from these sufferings!... People believe it! But that is =nonsense=!\r\n  The sufferings will only assume a new =form=, and will =increase=!!\r\n\r\n  Do you, then, believe that all the miseries of mankind at the present\r\n  time have been the result only of chance, not of =foresight=?\r\n\r\n  Oh, no! These sufferings were only the =stimulus= which drove mankind\r\n  forward to new construction, to greater progress, in order to avoid\r\n  suffering!... Progress brought new suffering, and so on.\r\n\r\n  “=Thus suffering is the civilizing factor of mankind! To free mankind\r\n  from suffering would mean to rob mankind of civilization.=”\r\n\r\n  Can we represent to ourselves a life of complete satisfaction?\r\n\r\n  No! Without suffering, the needs would be wanting which alone provide\r\n  the stimulus to progress!... Without suffering, we should also be\r\n  without enjoyment. For everything reaches our consciousness only by\r\n  means of its opposite.\r\n\r\n  “=To free us from torment means to rob us of pleasure.... But then we\r\n  should no longer have any interest in life!=”\r\n\r\n  “=Civilization is a union, a hermaphrodite structure, of pleasure and\r\n  pain--that is, masochism!!... The progress of mankind is only possible\r\n  by means of the masochistic principle.=”\r\n\r\n  =Oh, cruel-sweet philosophy of Golgotha!! Eternally shalt thou remain\r\n  the Moira and Kismet of humanity!!!=\r\n\r\n  VII.\r\n\r\n  “Always the more, always the better of your kind shall perish, for it\r\n  shall always be worse for you. So only--so only--does man grow\r\n  upwards” (Nietzsche, “Zarathustra,” ii., p. 126).\r\n\r\n  Magnificent Nietzsche!\r\n\r\n  Now first do I grasp your “superman”!... Now I share your hatred of\r\n  the every day and the average!\r\n\r\n  Away with the philistine cowardice which says, “Above all, do not go\r\n  too far!... Do everything with moderation and for a definite end!...\r\n  Never go too far, and never fall into extremes!”...\r\n\r\n  No!... Go forward with courage into the extreme!... Only slothfulness,\r\n  comfortableness, and cowardice are afraid of a Turkish bath, with the\r\n  subsequent cold douche!\r\n\r\n  But how the body softens under this _laisser faire et laisser passer_,\r\n  how it loses its power of resistance, accumulates substances which are\r\n  superfluous, and therefore harmful! In the same way that part of\r\n  humanity which follows this device will perish from the philistine\r\n  disease named “moderation”!\r\n\r\n  Let mankind get into its Turkish bath--and then get under the cold\r\n  douche! Thus it will be steeled, rejuvenated, and invigorated! Thus it\r\n  will be freed from superfluous matters!\r\n\r\n  “Let things be made continually worse and harder for mankind, then the\r\n  reaction will step in and drive them forward!”\r\n\r\n  According to this device I acted henceforward. To increase pain, in\r\n  order that pleasure might become greater!\r\n\r\n  An immeasurable love for humanity took possession of me now that I had\r\n  at length attained the point of view which so perfectly harmonized\r\n  with my individuality.... =I myself became equivalent to humanity=; I\r\n  felt the heart-beat of millions in myself. Their contradictory\r\n  feelings were united in my own person. I felt equally capitalist and\r\n  proletarian; equally orthodox Christian and Catholic, Jew and atheist;\r\n  equally man and woman.\r\n\r\n  All the sorrows and joys in humanity I felt in myself, and I plunged\r\n  myself in them to the depths.\r\n\r\n  I wished to experience them all in my own spirit.... I studied\r\n  universal history, but with what perception!... I did not confine\r\n  myself to facts, but I turned to the persons of those who were acting;\r\n  I represented to myself all the misery of the crowd and the thought of\r\n  the crowd.\r\n\r\n  What intolerable pain all these provided for me! How I began to love\r\n  glorious humanity which suffered all that!\r\n\r\n  Now the moment had come! Now was the time quickly to plunge into the\r\n  extreme of life!... To plunge into all the sorrows of the millions,\r\n  and to increase them tenfold, a hundredfold, a thousandfold! To drink\r\n  the voluptuous sensation which all experience in the paroxysm of\r\n  frenzy, and thus to become thoroughly man!!\r\n\r\n  VIII.\r\n\r\n  From now onwards I threw myself with enthusiasm into the arms of the\r\n  most extreme section of the anarchist movement. I gave up the whole of\r\n  my property to the support of newspapers, to the publication of\r\n  pamphlets, to the support of agitators, and so on. But, at the same\r\n  time, I remained in touch with the “upper ten thousand.” I travelled\r\n  through the principal countries of Europe and America, everywhere\r\n  forming associations, everywhere developing amid the receptive element\r\n  of the movement my most radical tendencies--in most cases with good\r\n  result.\r\n\r\n  (He now describes in detail his propagandist destructive activity,\r\n  especially in Spain.)\r\n\r\n  IX.\r\n\r\n  Meanwhile, in my home in Eastern Europe the revolutionary tendency was\r\n  continually gaining force; anarchism also became more influential. I\r\n  felt that there was the proper field for my further activity.\r\n\r\n  Henceforward I lived partly in Paris and partly in Genf and Zürich, in\r\n  order from these places to guide the movement in my direction.\r\n\r\n  Among my own countrymen I soon found adherents to whom nothing seemed\r\n  too fantastic, nothing too radical.\r\n\r\n  Soon we were in possession of a small printing-office, with the aid of\r\n  which we issued leaflets, pamphlets, and newspapers.\r\n\r\n  These generally contained the same ideas: the working classes should\r\n  not bother themselves with political demands, such as “universal\r\n  suffrage,” “individual liberty,” and the like. For, even if all these\r\n  were to be gained, social oppression and exploitation would remain\r\n  unaltered: these are what they feel most deeply, and from these evils\r\n  all the others result. The working classes should rather aim at the\r\n  “social revolution,” they should undertake the “expropriation of the\r\n  expropriators.”\r\n\r\n  In the newspapers and pamphlets we proved in a scientific manner the\r\n  justice of all forms of individual expropriation--robbery with\r\n  violence, theft, extortion, etc.; we conducted an attack on property;\r\n  we demanded the destruction of wealth, whether in private hands or in\r\n  the hands of the State, in order that its possession might be more\r\n  easily gained.\r\n\r\n  When the war between Japan and Russia broke out, we all felt that the\r\n  time for increased activity had now arrived--most of us moved to\r\n  Poland, Lithuania, or Bessarabia. A few only remained in Switzerland,\r\n  in order to keep a grip upon the organization in these parts.\r\n\r\n  X.\r\n\r\n  For me there now began a period of frightful sufferings.... With\r\n  frenzied haste, I seized all the possible news from the seat of war;\r\n  greedily I consulted the reports of great battles lasting for entire\r\n  weeks; I read of the dreadful storming of Port Arthur. All the\r\n  horrible details passed plainly before my eyes.\r\n\r\n  All the frightful tortures of the masses I represented in my\r\n  imagination. I saw how they stood in battle day after day; how they\r\n  had lost consciousness in consequence of hunger and thirst and\r\n  fatigue, and so went on fighting as mere automata. Ultimately they\r\n  even =forgot= to take nourishment, to drink, and to rest--they\r\n  actually did not any longer understand that they could free themselves\r\n  from their torture of hunger and thirst, could save their lives, by\r\n  eating and drinking--so they went on in a frenzy until they fell.\r\n\r\n  I was no longer capable of doing anything else than, with a swimming\r\n  head, with temples pulsating with fever, studying war reports. Day and\r\n  night these pictures were before me. Oh, if I could only stand with\r\n  them in this hell!... How I loved them, these people who were capable\r\n  of such grand actions!... I wished to call out to them: “Be embraced,\r\n  O millions! Receive the kiss of the whole world!”... Yes, these are\r\n  the true civilized nations!... To what progress must these horrible\r\n  sufferings give rise? What a future for mankind! What joys to come!\r\n\r\n  XI.\r\n\r\n  Meanwhile the whole of my property had been used up in the\r\n  revolutionary movement. The little money that was still available,\r\n  that we were still able to scrape together here and there, was\r\n  necessarily used for party purposes. I therefore suffered the most\r\n  horrible poverty--now in Warsaw, now in Lodz, Bialystok, Kiew, or\r\n  Odessa. ... Most of our adherents were among the poor Jewish quarters\r\n  of these towns.\r\n\r\n  My earnings consisted of occasional work and occasional theft. When\r\n  there was nothing doing in either of these ways, I moved on with a few\r\n  of my own kind from one of our supporters to another.... These people\r\n  divided with us the little they had.\r\n\r\n  It was a voluptuous joy to me, finally, to plunge into the uttermost\r\n  depths of misery which it is possible to reach.\r\n\r\n  It was an enormous victory to be able to live in such surroundings.\r\n  What glorious torments I suffered, until I had overcome the disgust\r\n  and loathing which the whole environment produced in me! Everywhere we\r\n  were amidst horrible dirt.\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding all the dirt and misery in which I saw these people\r\n  wallowing--or, precisely, because of these things--I began to love\r\n  them as hitherto I had loved no others.... When they told me of the\r\n  frightful persecutions which their people had endured as no other had\r\n  done, then I experienced an unnamable yearning to be one of them; then\r\n  I wondered at the enormous power with which, notwithstanding all\r\n  persecutions, amidst the most frightful misery which I saw around me,\r\n  yet they were able to be the most ardent revolutionists.\r\n\r\n  XII.\r\n\r\n  Everywhere now the revolution was in flood. We developed a feverish\r\n  activity in all our centres.... At first we had no very great\r\n  influence, but our emissaries were actively at work everywhere, in\r\n  order to convert our movement from a political one to a social one, or\r\n  at least to an economic one.\r\n\r\n  For this purpose we had provided a secret printing-press in Warsaw,\r\n  where we prepared the necessary leaflets. They were written by a\r\n  student, who was a genius in this speciality. No one understood as\r\n  well as he how to appeal to the instincts of the crowd. The moving\r\n  power of his style was incomparable.... He put the facts side by side,\r\n  illuminated them from the side that seemed to him most suitable, and\r\n  then drew his conclusions, which, in their simple convincing logic,\r\n  seemed irresistible. Then he turned to inflame fanaticism, reminded us\r\n  how, then and there, and there, and there, so many victims had been\r\n  sacrificed to the same idea; how, there and elsewhere, on the\r\n  barricades men had died for it, and had rather rotted in prison than\r\n  abandon their just demands. In this way he =always= succeeded in\r\n  moving the crowd.\r\n\r\n  It was very efficacious, also, to remind the people of all the little\r\n  tricks which had been played upon them by the manufacturers and by the\r\n  authorities; he drew their attention to the fact how they, who had\r\n  created everything, were actually not recognized as human beings, far\r\n  less as human beings with equal rights.... These proofs most readily\r\n  infuriated the proletarians to frenzy, and in some places, as in\r\n  Lagonsk, Tiflis, and Baku, we succeeded in turning the movement in the\r\n  economic direction. It was a great advantage that we had associates\r\n  everywhere, and we were quickly notified when the rain was likely to\r\n  begin, so that we could speedily move to another place.\r\n\r\n  In Tiflis the affair did not go as I wished; here the people were only\r\n  =too= practical.... They began neither to strike, nor to demolish, nor\r\n  to attack the soldiers.... No.... They simply said: “So much wages do\r\n  we want; then we shall work only for such a time; and no commodity\r\n  must rise in price.... Every one who will not take part with us we\r\n  shall shoot.”... All the inhabitants joined them.... After a short\r\n  time all this came to nothing.\r\n\r\n  Baku was more pleasing to me.... Here the petroleum-borers made their\r\n  demands, and as these were not agreed to within two days, they set\r\n  fire to 140 wells.... Then, to my great regret, the proprietors\r\n  agreed to everything which had been demanded. I had been so inhumanly\r\n  glad to see my life-ideal fulfilled. It seemed as if the situation was\r\n  going to be such as I had often imagined....\r\n\r\n  A long time already had the religious and racial hatred between the\r\n  Armenians and the Tartars been inflamed to the uttermost. In the whole\r\n  of the Caucasus there was a bubbling as if in a witch’s cauldron....\r\n  Naturally, I remained in Baku, in order to be ready for what I hoped\r\n  would happen there.\r\n\r\n  The whole population was at the uttermost point of tension; everything\r\n  seemed painfully uncertain; would the dance begin or not?... I felt\r\n  that it would only be necessary to throw a grain of sand into machine,\r\n  and in an instant it would lead to an avalanche.... I was possessed by\r\n  a frightful excitement; this mental tension was intolerable.... From\r\n  minute to minute the horrible anxiety of the undetermined increased in\r\n  me, and the hellish desire still burned within me; I longed that it\r\n  might start at this very minute, so that, at last, my nerve-destroying\r\n  tension might be relieved.\r\n\r\n  Then I became possessed with a demoniacal idea: one only needed to\r\n  give the slightest little push at the right place, and the storm would\r\n  break.\r\n\r\n  Inwardly I shuddered at the idea of the horrible consequences; and yet\r\n  something within me drove me forward with an irresistible\r\n  force--finally, to close the switch, and to allow the current to pass\r\n  which must give rise to the explosion.... “It is only a kind of\r\n  benevolent midwifery,” something seemed to whisper in my ear. “It must\r\n  happen, in any case!... The sooner the storm breaks, the better!”\r\n\r\n  Thus I was subjected to a conflict of perceptions, which made me quite\r\n  irresponsible. I was hurled to and fro by momentary feelings like a\r\n  football. A single word from the other side would have produced in me\r\n  such a suggestion that I should have blindly done anything I might\r\n  have been asked to do.\r\n\r\n  My state resembled that of those people of whom Blanqui says: “Paris\r\n  at any moment contains 50,000 men who are ready at a wave of the hand\r\n  to shed blood for any cause.” It is indifferent to them, he might have\r\n  added, if it is for the cause of freedom or for the cause of reaction.\r\n\r\n  This “destroy-everything mood,” which had so long been to me a\r\n  psychological riddle, I was now able to study in my own person, as the\r\n  result of an intensified masochistic predisposition.... At the\r\n  foundation of the whole hermaphroditic state, there lay nothing else\r\n  than the love of humanity.... An everyday humanity offers us no new\r\n  sensations.... We are only able to love when it is out of the\r\n  ordinary.... For this reason, we strive to see mankind in pain and\r\n  poverty--in order that we may love men more ardently; to love them for\r\n  that reason, because their misery provides for =us= intense pain.\r\n\r\n  For days I wandered about, fighting within myself a frightful\r\n  spiritual battle.... I felt that the only alternatives were either to\r\n  bring about a catastrophe or suicide. To wait any longer was beyond my\r\n  powers. A chance must decide....\r\n\r\n  A kind of trance state had taken possession of my organism.... I knew\r\n  nothing rightly: I did not know if everything around me was reality\r\n  or only a dream!... Yes, I even doubted my own existence!... At no\r\n  moment did I know where I was, how I had come there, what I had just\r\n  been doing, what I really was.... I remember only that suddenly I was\r\n  walking in the street in deep conversation with a man entirely unknown\r\n  to me.... Our conversation turned round the question, What was going\r\n  to happen?... Both of us were reserved, both on the watch; each seemed\r\n  to have the feeling--“He is seeing through me; I must not betray\r\n  myself!... Perhaps I shall be able to get something out of him!”...\r\n  Thus, we spoke with the most extreme caution about that which each of\r\n  us read in the soul of the other....\r\n\r\n  The passers-by stared at us; possibly we had been speaking rather too\r\n  loudly. It appeared to me that someone was following us in order to\r\n  listen to our conversation; we stopped, in order that this person\r\n  might be compelled to walk past us. It was an impudent lad, in the\r\n  years between boyhood and manhood; he stopped also, with his hands in\r\n  his trousers pockets, a few paces distant, and listened to us with\r\n  interest.... My companion was as much taken aback as I was myself, and\r\n  we both began to stammer. At the moment a crowd of gapers had\r\n  collected around us, hoping to hear something of interest. We both\r\n  became continually more confused; my head began to swim, and I began\r\n  to say something. It must have been nonsense that I spoke, for my\r\n  companion looked at me, half astonished and half alarmed, and several\r\n  persons in the crowd began to titter. This made me suddenly lose my\r\n  head more even than before, and I began to get angry. Suddenly I\r\n  shouted out to my companion: “That will have the most frightful\r\n  results; they have cut off the Tartar’s feet and hands, and now the\r\n  Tartars will massacre the whole town!”... All those around me began to\r\n  talk to one another at once. “Cut off feet and hands!”... I had turned\r\n  the switch and the current had passed....\r\n\r\n  I do not know how I got home.... My landlady rushed to me with the\r\n  news: “The Tartars are going to burn the town to ashes, and to murder\r\n  all the Armenians. Some of them have had their feet and hands cut off;\r\n  their noses have been slit, their eyes cut out; boiling oil has been\r\n  poured into their ears.... The people are all running away, or\r\n  barricading themselves in their houses!”\r\n\r\n  XIII.\r\n\r\n  I did not see the beginning of the drama, for immediately after my\r\n  return home I fell into a death-like slumber, which lasted more than\r\n  fifty hours. No one could have kept about after such a spiritual\r\n  storm.... When I awoke, I was so weak that only with labour could I\r\n  move a few paces; my whole body trembled unceasingly.... I had\r\n  absolutely no other desire but for repose.... After I had somewhat\r\n  recovered, I went to sleep again until the next morning.\r\n\r\n  Now I once more felt comparatively strong, although my arms and legs\r\n  still trembled. My hostess--a German woman, long ago deserted in this\r\n  town--gave me an account of the atrocities perpetrated by the Tartars.\r\n  As I went out, the town seemed to be dead. In the streets there still\r\n  lay numerous horrible, mutilated corpses; the shops were closed; here\r\n  and there houses were demolished. As far as I could learn, in =Tiflis=\r\n  the Tartars had done even worse.... Here in Baku they had fired the\r\n  boring-wells of the Armenians; from these the fire had spread to the\r\n  rest, so that the entire petroleum industry was ruined, and 10,000 men\r\n  were out of work.\r\n\r\n  All this, however, made no impression on me. A frightful relaxation\r\n  and apathy had taken possession of me; I felt neither pain, nor\r\n  pleasure, nor sympathy. It was the reaction following the previous\r\n  hypertension of the nerves.\r\n\r\n  I cared no longer to stay here, and I resolved to return to Kiew, and\r\n  later to Warsaw or to Lodz.\r\n\r\n  XIV.\r\n\r\n  After a short stay in Rostow, on the Don, I reached Kiew, and was\r\n  received by the group with much joy. They had believed that I had\r\n  fallen in the massacre at Baku or Tiflis.\r\n\r\n  Our successes in Tiflis and Baku in the economic province, by means of\r\n  the economic terror, were now utilized at every opportunity; they only\r\n  regretted that, owing to the racial conflict, everything had been once\r\n  more destroyed.\r\n\r\n  During my absence there had been many changes here. In Odessa, Kiew,\r\n  Warsaw, Lodz, and Bialystok, successful “expropriations” had been\r\n  effected. These “new tactics” had not only been strikingly successful\r\n  in almost every case, but they had also attracted towards us the\r\n  sympathies of those who had hitherto not taken in much earnest our\r\n  influence upon the revolution.\r\n\r\n  These “expropriations” were carried out in various ways. For example,\r\n  by one of our associates, who was an official in the postal service,\r\n  we were kept informed when, anywhere in the neighbourhood of the town,\r\n  the post-office coach was to pass an isolated place, carrying anything\r\n  of considerable value. We then attacked it and plundered it.\r\n\r\n  Or we sent out spies to learn when, in any great person’s house, or in\r\n  any bank, large sums of money would be on hand, and at what time the\r\n  fewest employees would be there. Armed to the teeth, we crowded in,\r\n  and demanded the surrender of the money, leaving in its place a\r\n  receipt with the dreaded imprint of our organization. It also\r\n  happened--as in Odessa--that a bomb was exploded in a business\r\n  locality. Every one ran up to see what had happened. Meanwhile, one of\r\n  our bands entered the place of business from behind and plundered the\r\n  safe.\r\n\r\n  What a quantity of intelligence, energy, perseverance, and knowledge\r\n  had to be employed, to render such enterprises possible! How we had to\r\n  watch for weeks, to form plans and reject them; how our arrangements\r\n  must be altered at the last moment, or the enterprise entirely\r\n  abandoned! Of this every one and no one can form an idea for himself.\r\n\r\n  Here, at any rate, I do =not= propose to give a detailed description\r\n  of these affairs, because my sketches do not aim at giving a\r\n  description of the revolution, or of those who participated in it, but\r\n  =simply and solely to represent the motives of my own activity=:\r\n  Therefore I describe my own =environment=, only in so far as it is\r\n  necessary to do so for the =understanding= of these =motives=.\r\n\r\n  These “expropriations” were, moreover, not an anarchist speciality,\r\n  for they were also undertaken by the other terrorist parties.\r\n\r\n  He, however, who believes that the revolutionaries employed this money\r\n  for their personal needs is grossly deceived. After, as before, they\r\n  remained in their miserable holes, eating rotten herrings and going\r\n  barefoot, in order not to destroy their union with the workmen, and\r\n  not to lose the latter’s confidence. The money was used solely for\r\n  revolutionary purposes--for providing weapons and printing-presses;\r\n  for the erection of laboratories for making bombs; for the expenses of\r\n  the journeys of smugglers and propagandists; for bribery; and for the\r\n  support of those who had been arrested, and of their families--also\r\n  the families of those who had been killed or wounded.\r\n\r\n  XV.\r\n\r\n  Soon after my return from Baku, I was transferred to Warsaw, in order\r\n  to take part in the May-day celebrations of 1905--these May-day\r\n  celebrations taking place according to the calendar of non-Russian\r\n  countries.\r\n\r\n  The war, the unceasing extensive strikes and disturbances, had\r\n  resulted everywhere in giving rise to horrible misery, which was\r\n  further increased by the political crisis and by the arrest of all\r\n  branches of industry.\r\n\r\n  All the misery of which I had always dreamed I now saw unceasingly\r\n  around me. It might be believed that at length my desires would have\r\n  obtained satisfaction! But this was not so. In the same degree as that\r\n  with which the poverty around me increased did my sensibility, too,\r\n  become blunted; I became accustomed to its appearance; I regarded it\r\n  as an everyday occurrence, as something easily comprehensible.\r\n\r\n  =Somewhat= more did I love and honour humanity on account of this\r\n  misery; but not to the extent of something beyond force, something\r\n  “superhuman,” which would have been necessary for my complete\r\n  satisfaction. Perhaps in Baku I should have experienced this\r\n  superhuman feeling, had it not been that at the decisive moment my\r\n  body gave way under the strain. Was that, perhaps, prearranged by\r\n  Nature? Has Nature imposed these limits upon an individual, in order\r\n  to prevent him from raising himself above the human standard?\r\n\r\n  Can it be that the state into which I fell at Baku resembled a\r\n  “syncope of the soul,” which ensued when my psychical state began to\r\n  verge upon the superhuman, in consequence of the torments around me,\r\n  just as bodily syncope renders us unconscious when physical pain\r\n  exceeds the limits of human capacity?\r\n\r\n  These questions now began to occupy me. I could only attain certainty\r\n  by means of experiment; and I must obtain certainty, even if the half\r\n  of humanity had to be sacrificed, as one sacrifices a rabbit in an\r\n  experiment.\r\n\r\n  Impatiently I awaited the first of May.... Perhaps that day would\r\n  bring me a solution of the riddle!... The workmen were still\r\n  undecided: should they demonstrate or not?... I began to urge them\r\n  =in favour of= the demonstration; =my= reason is easy to\r\n  understand....\r\n\r\n  It was unquestionably one of the largest demonstrations that Warsaw\r\n  had ever witnessed. In the narrow streets there was packed an\r\n  innumerable crowd. Suddenly from all sides the soldiers charged the\r\n  demonstration.... A frightful panic--such as I have never before\r\n  seen--seized the crowd. Resistance was not to be thought of--it was a\r\n  _sauve qui peut_!\r\n\r\n  In mad fear of death, every one began to scream, and to seek refuge in\r\n  the houses.... At the doors of the houses there ensued a frightful\r\n  pressure. Many were thrown to the ground; these were trodden to pulp.\r\n  On the ground-floor the windows were broken in, and people crawled\r\n  through them into the houses. Meanwhile, the Cossacks were raging up\r\n  and down, cutting people down with their sabres. There were deafening\r\n  screams of fear, and with these and with the groans of the wounded\r\n  there mingled the bestial “Süiy” of the Cossacks, so as to produce a\r\n  nerve-lacerating concert of hell. And around one could see the\r\n  unnaturally dilated pupils, the widely opened eyes, and the faces\r\n  distracted with anxiety, of those who were seeking safety in flight.\r\n\r\n  The same excitement had seized on me also; with a wildly beating\r\n  heart, and an unbearably distressing feeling of contracture in the\r\n  loins, which produced in my entire organism a kind of “anxious\r\n  ecstasy,” I began to hope.... But it would not come....\r\n\r\n  XVI.\r\n\r\n  In Odessa, which was exhausted by unceasing fights and strikes, the\r\n  strength of the reaction began to make itself felt, and there were\r\n  fears of a “pogrom” (an attack on the Jews). The forces of the\r\n  reaction in these pogroms always made use of the Lumpenproletariat\r\n  (the blackguardly element of the mob).\r\n\r\n  Since the most trustworthy of our Odessa associates were Jews, and\r\n  thus had no influence with the Lumpenproletariat, they urged me to go\r\n  to Odessa, and, as a non-Hebrew, to use my influence to prevent the\r\n  pogrom. It was not possible for me to refuse, although in secret I\r\n  rejoiced at the prospect of the pogrom.\r\n\r\n  In Kiew, where I had some business, I met by chance an acquaintance\r\n  belonging to my more prosperous past. This man knew nothing of my\r\n  revolutionary activities. He, for his part, was an arch anti-Semite.\r\n  In consequence of the disturbances, his business had been completely\r\n  ruined. He described the whole revolution as the work of the Jews, and\r\n  also abused the Government, which, in his opinion, was to blame for\r\n  the weakness which it exhibited in dealing with the revolutionary\r\n  forces.\r\n\r\n  “But,” he continued, with a wink, “if the Government does nothing, we\r\n  shall know how to help ourselves a little!” I pretended to be entirely\r\n  of his opinion, and he told me in confidence that there already\r\n  existed in Odessa a secret committee, which was to take the matter in\r\n  hand. He also was a member. A large sum of money had already been\r\n  collected, in order to pay certain persons who were to arrange the\r\n  entire “Hetze.” If I wished, I could be his guest, and he would make\r\n  me a member of the committee. I agreed.\r\n\r\n  The next day I was actually enrolled in the committee. Who the members\r\n  really were I did not learn. One characteristic was common to them\r\n  all--a frightful indolence.... Everything was ready. They would\r\n  arrange for patriotic demonstrations, and would then throw\r\n  proclamations amongst the people, to tell them that the Jews had sworn\r\n  an oath to combine with the Japanese for the destruction of Holy\r\n  Russia; that the revolution had been begun by the Jews in order that\r\n  the Little Father’s army must meet enemies on both sides at once.\r\n  Thus, for all the present misery the Jews only were to blame, etc....\r\n  Everything had been arranged already, and was in the hands of people\r\n  who were prepared to undertake the whole affair. The only thing now\r\n  wanting was the proclamation.\r\n\r\n  My acquaintances now began to praise my genius as an author, and they\r\n  all pressed me to begin immediately to compose the required leaflet.\r\n  The proposal suited me; I do not need to say why. With zeal I threw\r\n  myself upon the task, and the proclamation was a masterpiece of\r\n  demagogic art, and a crowning example of the “appeal to the beast in\r\n  man,” as it is ordinarily called.\r\n\r\n  The diffusion of this “document of civilization,” as it is called by\r\n  the revolutionists, took place in connexion with the planned\r\n  demonstration. The day passed without an outbreak, although the\r\n  imminence of the storm could, as one may say, be felt in the air. Not\r\n  until the evening were a few Jews beaten here and there.\r\n\r\n  On the second day our people arranged for a second demonstration. From\r\n  the other side they endeavoured to form a counter-demonstration, and\r\n  the two came in conflict. The Black Hundreds (drawn from the\r\n  Lumpenproletariat), who fought in the name of “patriotism,” dispersed\r\n  the counter-demonstrators, and began to demolish and to plunder in the\r\n  Jewish quarter of the town.\r\n\r\n  The breaking of the panes of glass, and the destruction of the goods\r\n  in the shop-windows and of the furniture in the houses, seemed to\r\n  inflame the crowd more and more; they must have experienced a sort of\r\n  voluptuous sensation in connexion with these activities. Finally, they\r\n  found some Jews who had hidden themselves. A horrible yell was now\r\n  raised. The Jews were dragged out into the street; they were struck\r\n  with everything available--with cudgels, hatchets, and knives--until\r\n  they were completely unrecognizable. The crowd found more and more of\r\n  them. Most of them threw themselves on their knees and begged for\r\n  life; it was most horrible to see them, beaten till their features\r\n  were no longer distinguishable, still pleading for mercy. Now the mob\r\n  really began to smell blood, and to display its whole true human\r\n  nature. Each began to murder according to his own individual fancy.\r\n  Here a man cut the breast from a nursing mother; there they tore the\r\n  clothes from some girls, and flogged them naked through the streets.\r\n  In another place they dragged a Jewess, naked, from her house into the\r\n  street, tied her hand and foot, and fastened her by the hair to the\r\n  axle of a cab; then they drove off at a gallop until she was battered\r\n  to death. Behind the cab there ran street-arabs, striking at her\r\n  body.... But to what purpose is it to describe these scenes, at which\r\n  one’s heart is convulsed in one’s body with sorrow, and simultaneously\r\n  one wishes to exult with joy and triumph?\r\n\r\n  Here I saw once more, in their proper environment, the 50,000 of whom\r\n  Blanqui speaks. A wave of the hand would have sufficed--although 99\r\n  per cent, of them unquestionably felt no hostility towards the\r\n  Jews--to produce in all of them the most infernal anti-Semitic\r\n  excesses. If the police would allow it, as they allow the pogrom,\r\n  another wave of the hand would direct the mob with no less ease to\r\n  make an attack on another human variety--for example, on the\r\n  capitalists.\r\n\r\n  What psychological factor drove them on?... Was it simply a tendency\r\n  to cruelty?... No!... A love of cruelty considered by itself, without\r\n  a nobler motive, is inhuman, inharmonious to human nature, and man\r\n  =cannot= escape his own nature. There must therefore be other motives\r\n  at the basis of such actions, motives of a nature more humanly\r\n  comprehensible.\r\n\r\n  But look at all those slaughterers! Regard their physiognomy! Not a\r\n  trace of cruelty--only suffering, =unheard-of= suffering, is reflected\r\n  on these faces!... The fear of death and the pain of their victims\r\n  prepares for =themselves= incredible torment!... Do you not believe\r\n  that these people will return to their houses, and will suffer intense\r\n  mental pain?... They will continually see, in imagination, the last\r\n  beseeching glance of their victim, full of complaint and reproach,\r\n  directed upon them!... What hatred, what contempt, will they feel for\r\n  the animal which has awakened within them! They will feel a longing to\r\n  spit in their own faces, to strike themselves, to strangle\r\n  themselves!... Before every one whom they meet they will lower their\r\n  eyes: “He knows that I have murdered people, amid the most cruel\r\n  tortures, against whom there was no hatred in my heart--murdered only\r\n  for this reason: because I had within me the instinctive demand for\r\n  spiritual torment; because by the situation in which I suddenly found\r\n  myself one pole of my hermaphrodite nature was suddenly discharged!”\r\n\r\n  “They are =masochists=, only they do not know it.”\r\n\r\n  Self-contempt suddenly seized me amidst this Satanic orgy of suffering\r\n  on the part of such =unconscious, instinctive masochists=. The\r\n  remembrance that all these persons were being led onwards by a blind\r\n  animal impulse, and that to-morrow they would fall on their knees\r\n  before their God and pray to Him for pardon, filled me with disgust. I\r\n  began to hate this stupid mass. I wanted to see them grovel in the\r\n  dust themselves, and howl for mercy.\r\n\r\n  For this purpose it was only necessary to organize the _Selbstschutz_\r\n  (a union for the prevention of persecution of the Jews). In order to\r\n  effect this, I tried to get into the Jewish quarter. I succeeded in\r\n  doing so by means of some side passages. Hardly had I reached this\r\n  quarter, when I came across masses of these “Self-Protectors.”\r\n  Finally, I found among them some acquaintances, and I joined them.\r\n\r\n  A heated contest now began to rage.... As the Black Hundreds were now\r\n  so energetically attacked, all their heroism was speedily at an end:\r\n  they took to flight. At this moment the soldiers appeared--not, as one\r\n  might have imagined, to attack the Black Hundreds, but to attack the\r\n  “Self-Protectors.”\r\n\r\n  My arm, which was stretched out in front of me, was traversed\r\n  longitudinally by a rifle-bullet in a peculiar manner. I sank to the\r\n  ground at first, but soon recovered sufficiently to get up and run\r\n  away.\r\n\r\n  That inexpressible sense of complete satisfaction by means of\r\n  suffering, for which I was continually searching--which, so to say, I\r\n  felt to slumber within me--once more appeared in actual experience. I\r\n  always had the impression that there was something wanting, that it\r\n  was necessary to awaken something within me which hitherto had existed\r\n  in my consciousness only in a dormant state.... At the same time, a\r\n  voice whispered to me that I was demanding something superhuman; that\r\n  the attainment of such a thing must logically overwhelm my purely\r\n  =human= powers, and that it would involve my annihilation.\r\n\r\n  Day and night these thoughts tormented me: “You =must= gain this\r\n  experience--even if it involves your destruction!... But what if, at\r\n  the last moment--as at Baku--a further incapacity, a ‘spiritual\r\n  syncope,’ ensues?”\r\n\r\n  One thing I knew--“When you reach it, it will only be by yourself; all\r\n  others will break to pieces =before= you!”\r\n\r\n  XVII.\r\n\r\n  I no longer had any interest in the development of revolutionary\r\n  affairs, since for =my own= purposes they were no longer serviceable.\r\n\r\n  The new questions which now arose--as, for example, the propaganda\r\n  among the Lumpenproletariat--left me cold.... In the pogrom we had\r\n  seen what an unawakened force--reputed as revolutionary, but in\r\n  reality =masochistic=--was slumbering in the Lumpenproletariat. That\r\n  this force could also be used in the service of reaction was ascribed\r\n  to the fact that all these thieves, criminals, and prostitutes, came\r\n  into contact only with the working classes. But since they earn from\r\n  the latter nothing but contempt, their sensibility was turned\r\n  =against= the working classes.\r\n\r\n  This unfortunate state of affairs it was proposed to counteract by\r\n  going among the criminals, just as in earlier years they had gone\r\n  among the working people. An endeavour was made to organize the\r\n  Lumpenproletariat, in order to win their sympathies.\r\n\r\n  The movement was in part successful, although it brought with it much\r\n  corruption. Thus it happened that the criminals endeavoured to turn\r\n  the matter to their own advantage, and began to pursue their\r\n  profession in the name of anarchism. For example, in Warsaw they\r\n  visited the house of an enormously rich Jewish banker, whose father\r\n  had recently died, and, under the mask of anarchism, demanded from him\r\n  10,000 roubles, with the threat that if he did not give the money,\r\n  they would dig up the corpse of his father and bury it in\r\n  unconsecrated ground. When we remember there is nothing more horrible\r\n  for an orthodox Jew than to rest in unconsecrated soil, we shall\r\n  understand that the banker gave the money; but this occurrence aroused\r\n  a great sensation, and people began to identify anarchists with common\r\n  criminals.\r\n\r\n  Now the anarchists had to endure the persecution, not only of the\r\n  Government, but also that of other revolutionary parties and of the\r\n  Lumpenproletariat--the latter for this reason: because they did not\r\n  wish their names to be associated with actions which were undertaken\r\n  for personal advantage, and not for revolutionary aims.\r\n\r\n  This campaign against the anarchists from three different sides must\r\n  soon bring about disaster.\r\n\r\n  During this time I was perpetually puzzling over the problem: “Will\r\n  the idea you have dreamed of be realized within you?... Will it lead\r\n  to your destruction?... Or will it overwhelm your powers, and lead\r\n  once more to spiritual syncope?”\r\n\r\n  By means of an experiment, the matter could be determined!...\r\n  Supposing one were to distribute broadcast plague bacilli!... If\r\n  entire towns were to suffer from this disease!... If the fear of death\r\n  was to seize the whole crowd of those who, in their cowardice at every\r\n  strike, every demonstration, every fight at the barricades, had hidden\r\n  behind the stove or crept under the bed!... If this fear of death were\r\n  to increase to a general panic, affecting entire towns, entire\r\n  countries, as happened in the middle ages!... If the people, in their\r\n  despair, should look for the disseminators of the trouble, and should\r\n  proceed to hew one another to pieces!... Would my relief come then?...\r\n  Will there be an =answer= for me?\r\n\r\n  I shudder to think of the suffering which this would entail for me! I\r\n  feel that I am not equal to this!... I suffer, on the other hand,\r\n  inexpressibly, because I have no answer, no recognition, no\r\n  satisfaction!... I will--and I cannot. To endure longer this\r\n  hermaphroditic state--this is death or lunacy!... What to do?... How\r\n  to free oneself from this horrible dilemma?\r\n\r\n  Oh, why am I not like others?... Why cannot I simply accept =that\r\n  which is=?... Why do I torment myself to climb the mountain, in order\r\n  to stand before a bottomless abyss?... Before an abyss whose secret\r\n  depths will be manifest to me only if I hurl myself into it!...\r\n\r\n  What to do?... What to do?... Shall I, or shall I not?... I =will=!...\r\n  I =must=!...\r\n\r\n  As I was about to do it, I was arrested! Chance or foresight?\r\n\r\n  Oh, fate, fate! =That= is too much of suffering!... Oh, mankind,\r\n  mankind, what have you done?... A single one wished to =see=. A single\r\n  one wished to tear a veil from the image--and you have hindered it!...\r\n  Eternally you will have darkness around you!... But why will you not\r\n  allow me to see the light?\r\n\r\n  Is it thus that you thank =me=, who have loved humanity as no other\r\n  has loved!\r\n\r\n  Yes; that is once over again the cruel, the pitiless philosophy of\r\n  Golgotha--\r\n\r\n  “=He who will love--must suffer!=”\r\n\r\n  [588] Havelock Ellis, “Studies in the Psychology of Sex,” vol. iii.,\r\n  “Analysis of the Sexual Impulse.”\r\n\r\n  [589] A special account of this matter is found in an interesting work\r\n  by G.

Fetichism first becomes abnormal, or pathological,\r\nwhen the partial representation becomes completely divorced from the\r\ngeneral representation of the personality, so that, for example, a plait\r\nof hair or a pocket-handkerchief is loved alone and by itself,\r\ndisconnected from the person to whom it belongs.\r\n\r\nThe development of love can always be referred to fetichistic ideas, for\r\nwhen we examine critically the first general impression which the\r\nbeloved makes upon the lover, we always find that there are certain\r\n=parts= or =functions= which have made the =greatest= impression, and\r\nhave exercised a greater erotic influence than other portions. To the\r\nformer of these, therefore, the imagination and the sensibility more\r\nespecially =cleave=. In my “Contributions to the Etiology of\r\nPsychopathia Sexualis” (vol. ii., p. 311), I defined sexual fetiches as\r\npeculiar =symbols= of the =essence= of the beloved personality, with\r\nwhich the idea of the entire type is most readily associated. M.\r\nHirschfeld later enunciated the same views.\r\n\r\nAs sexual fetiches we may have: (1) =Portions of the body=; (2)\r\n=functions and emanations of the body=; and (3) =objects which have any\r\nkind of relation to the body=.\r\n\r\nUnder (1) we may enumerate the hand, the foot, the nose, the ears, the\r\neyes, the hair of the head, the hair of the beard, the throat and the\r\nback of the neck, the breasts, the hips, the genital organs, the\r\nbuttocks, the calves. All these parts may constitute sexual fetiches.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of all the influences enumerated under (2)--viz., gait,\r\nmovement, voice, glance, odour, complexion.\r\n\r\nUnder (3) we may enumerate the clothing as a =whole= (as costume) and in\r\nits individual parts, upper-clothing and underclothing, hat, eyeglasses,\r\nway of dressing the hair, necktie, bodice, corset, chemise, petticoat,\r\nstockings, shoes or boots, apron, handkerchief, clothing materials (fur,\r\nsatin, silk), the colour of clothing (mourning, parti-coloured blouses,\r\nwhite clothing, uniform), fashion (_cul de Paris_, _décolleté_ and\r\n_retroussé_, _tricot_); indeed, clothing fetichism goes so far that a\r\nparticular shape of the heel of the shoe, a particular mode of\r\nornamentation of some particular part of the clothing, and, finally, any\r\nstriking part of the clothing, may become a sexual fetich.\r\n\r\nThis fetichistic influence is further increased by a peculiar\r\ncharacteristic of human love. This is its tendency towards\r\n=idealization=, =beautification=, and =enlargement= of those parts which\r\nespecially affect the senses. This beautification and idealization\r\nextends from the body to the clothing, and to articles in general, used\r\nby the beloved person, but normally remains associated with the entire\r\npersonality. It is first by means of the enlargement and accentuation of\r\na distinct part that this becomes separated from the general idea, and\r\nthus its removal and conversion into a “fetich” is prepared for. In the\r\nchapter on clothing we drew attention to this general anthropological\r\nphenomenon of the enlargement and accentuation of many parts by means of\r\nsuch measures as painting, articles of clothing, exposure, way of doing\r\nthe hair, etc.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as now, by the ideal and actual accentuation of the part under\r\nconsideration, it is projected as a more independent structure, and\r\nseparates itself from the personality as a whole, it is involuntarily\r\n=isolated= in idea by the fetichist, and becomes =generalized= to\r\nconstitute an independent stimulus, which may now, temporarily or\r\npermanently, completely take the place of the personality as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis physiological process embraces both the “lesser” and the “greater”\r\nfetichism of Binet.\r\n\r\nThe lesser fetichism consists in this: that the lover, without going so\r\nfar as to lose sight completely of the entire person of his beloved,\r\nstill directs his attention to =individual= special charms, or is in\r\ngeneral first attracted to the beloved woman by means of =quite\r\ndistinct qualities=, such as the shape and smallness of the hand, the\r\ncolour and sparkling of the eyes, the abundance and softness of the\r\nhair, the complexion, a distinct odour, a melodious voice, etc. In the\r\n“lesser” fetichism the partial representation plays, indeed, a very\r\nprominent part in the general picture, but does not entirely obliterate\r\nthis picture.\r\n\r\nIn the “greater” fetichism, on the other hand, a particular portion, or\r\nfunction, or quality, or an article of clothing, or an object of\r\ncustomary use belonging to the beloved person, is isolated from this\r\nlatter, and in a sense becomes transformed into the latter, and assumes\r\nwholly and completely the character of a being capable by itself of\r\nexercising a sexually exciting influence. This is genuine sexual\r\nfetichism.\r\n\r\nBinet and von Schrenck-Notzing have referred the genesis of fetichism,\r\nas a rule, to some =chance occurrence= during childhood--to a\r\nfetichistic impression which chanced to coincide with sexual excitement,\r\nand thus obtained a permanently sexual coloration. The time of puberty\r\nand the first sexual relationships are especially dangerous for the\r\nformation of such associations of ideas. Von Schrenck-Notzing rightly\r\ndraws attention to the fact that this perverse associative connexion, as\r\na reaction to powerful external impressions, does not occur only, as\r\nBinet assumes, in predisposed individuals, but is also =quite peculiarly\r\ncharacteristic of the childish mental life at the time when the brain is\r\nundergoing growth, as well as of the less-developed intellectual powers\r\nof savage races=, among whom at the present time, in quite other\r\nprovinces than the sexual, fetichism is cultivated in the most excessive\r\nmanner; thus, fetichism is often manifested by persons with perfectly\r\nnormal brains. Such chance occurrences for the origination of sexual\r\nfetichism occur in games, in reading, in solitary and mutual\r\nmasturbation. Nearly always, in connexion with the genesis of fetichism,\r\nwe can prove that there has been some such actual predisposing cause.\r\n\r\nIn numerous cases of the “greater” fetichism, especially in the category\r\nof the hair fetichists (“plait-cutters”), shoe fetichists, and\r\nhandkerchief fetichists, there is also associated a more or less severe\r\npsychopathic constitution, on the foundation of which the fetichistic\r\nimpulse has developed as a kind of “=coercive idea=” (obsession). These\r\nare the cases which have the greatest forensic importance, and which\r\ngain publicity.\r\n\r\nWe shall now proceed to give a brief account of the most important forms\r\nof sexual fetichism, and those most frequently encountered.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, =parts=, =functions=, and =qualities= of the body may\r\nconstitute sexual fetiches; the possibilities in this respect, extending\r\nfrom head to foot, have been enumerated above. Moreover, odd as it may\r\nsound, the =entire human being= may also become a sexual fetich, not as\r\na whole personality--that would be normal love--but as a =national= or\r\n=racial= individual. In such a case we have the so-called “=racial\r\nfetichism=.” The European newspapers are full of interesting reports of\r\nthe peculiar attractive force exercised by exotic individuals, female or\r\nmale, such as negroes, Arabs, Abyssinians, Moors, Indians, Japanese,\r\netc., upon European men and women respectively. Whenever members of such\r\nraces come to stay in any European capital, we hear of remarkable love\r\naffairs between white girls and these strangers, of romantic abductions,\r\nand other mad adventures. The novelty, peculiarity, piquancy of the\r\nstrange races has the effect of a fetich. The size, the figure, the\r\nphysiognomy, tint of skin, smell, tattooing, adornment, costume, speech,\r\ndance, and song, of these savage men exercise a fascinating influence.\r\nWhite men have from very early times had a peculiar weakness for negroes\r\nand for mulatto women and girls. As early as the eighteenth century\r\nthere existed in Paris negro brothels; and somewhat later, after\r\nNapoleon’s Egyptian expedition, negroes and negresses came in large\r\nnumbers to Paris, and were utilized for the gratification of the lusts\r\nof both sexes.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the deeply-rooted racial hatred, even in America racial\r\nfetichism gives rise to numerous connexions of this kind. The “coloured\r\ngirl” exercises a powerful attractive force upon the American man; and\r\neven the proud American woman manifests, with an especial frequency in\r\nChicago, a certain preference for the male negro.[628] But much greater\r\nis the alluring force exercised by the white upon the negro. More\r\nespecially among civilized negroes does the white woman play the part of\r\na fetich. This is the explanation of the frequent rape, or attempted\r\nrape, of white girls on the part of negroes--one of the principal causes\r\nof the Southern lynchings.\r\n\r\nAmong the parts of the body which act as fetiches, we have especially to\r\nmention the hair of woman’s head. “=Hair fetichism=” is widely diffused,\r\nboth in the physiological “lesser” form and in the pathological\r\n“greater” form. The abundance and the colour of the hair have an equal\r\ninfluence in normal love also as a “fetich.” Hair, “of sweetest flesh,\r\nthe tenderest, Sweetest growth,” as Eduard Grisebach terms it in his\r\n“Neue Tanhäuser,” has a profound sexual significance; with primitive\r\nman, also, it probably played the same rôle of a sexually stimulating\r\n“veil” which was later played by tattooing and clothing. The hair of the\r\nhead, and special modes of arranging that hair, play an important part\r\nin sexual selection among the savage races. The odour of the hair also\r\nhas a sexually stimulating influence, and remains persistent in the\r\nimagination. The softness also of the hair, the waving, curling movement\r\nof woman’s loosened hair, and the rustling of the hair, excite the\r\nimagination. But most important of all is the colour of the hair; and in\r\nthis respect =blonde= or reddish-blonde hair unquestionably takes the\r\nfirst rank as a sexual fetich. Blonde hair exercised such an influence\r\nin the days of the Roman Empire. The demi-monde of all times has\r\nutilized this form of hair fetichism, felt by men, for its own purposes,\r\neither by dyeing the hair a fair colour, or by the wearing of\r\nfair-haired wigs. There exist, also, fetichistic impulses towards brown,\r\nblack, and red hair respectively. Jon Lehmann tells (_Breslauer\r\nZeitung_, August 24, 1906) of a great libertine who was happy with any\r\nor all pretty girls, as long as they had not red hair and were not the\r\ndaughters of clergymen. Innumerable times had he made this assertion.\r\nMany years later Lehmann found him as the happy husband of--a red-haired\r\nclergyman’s daughter! “C’est l’amour qui a fait cela,” he answered\r\nlaconically to the astonished question why he had been so unfaithful to\r\nthe principles of his youth.\r\n\r\nHair fetichism manifests itself in various ways. Many people are,\r\nproperly speaking, rather smell fetichists than hair fetichists; they\r\ncontent themselves simply with smelling the hair, and this constitutes\r\ntheir only, or their principal, sexual gratification. Other hair\r\nfetichists obtain sexual enjoyment by looking at the hair, or by passing\r\nthe fingers through it. The following case, reported by Archenholtz\r\n(“England and Italy,” vol. i., p. 448; Leipzig, 1785), is typical:\r\n\r\n  “I was acquainted with an Englishman who was an honourable man; but he\r\n  had a very peculiar taste, which, as he frequently assured me, was\r\n  deeply rooted in his soul. His greatest pleasure, which alone could\r\n  intoxicate his senses, was to comb the hair of a beautiful woman. He\r\n  kept a very handsome mistress for this purpose only. =Love and woman\r\n  did not, in the ordinary sense, come under consideration; he had\r\n  nothing to do except with her hair.= In the hours that suited him, she\r\n  must take down her hair and let him pass his hands through it. This\r\n  operation produced in him the most intense degree of physical\r\n  voluptuousness.”\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable class of hair-fetichists are the so-called\r\n“=plait-cutters=.” The transition to this morbid state depends upon the\r\ncustom, widely diffused in earlier times, of cutting off and preserving\r\nlocks of hair as erotic fetiches. This sexual reliquary cult flourished\r\nespecially in the eighteenth century, during the period of “sentiment.”\r\nFriedrich S. Krauss reports (“Anthropophyteia,” vol. i., p. 163) that\r\namong the Southern Slavs young men and women gave one another tufts of\r\npubic hair as sexual fetiches. The “wig-collectors” also belong to the\r\ncategory of harmless hair fetichists. More serious are the genuine\r\n“plait-cutters”--persons who are accustomed to cut plaits of hair from\r\nthe heads of girls, who are happy in the possession of these plaits, and\r\nwho obtain sexual gratification simply by looking at and touching them.\r\nThese plait-cutters are almost unquestionably pathological individuals,\r\nwho act under the influence of coercive impulses. Recently, in Berlin,\r\ntwo such cases attracted public attention. The judicial proceedings\r\nconnected with the former of these cases elicited such interesting\r\ndetails regarding the development, psychology, and activity of plait\r\nfetichism that it is worth preserving, and is therefore given here at\r\nlength, quoted from a report in the _Berliner Tageblatt_, No. 118, of\r\nMarch 6, 1906.\r\n\r\n  PERVERSITIES BEFORE THE LAW COURTS.\r\n\r\n  The plait-cutter whose arrest attracted so much attention appeared\r\n  yesterday in the Assessor’s Court, under the presidency of the\r\n  judicial assessor Förster. The accused, Robert S., was a student of\r\n  the Technical High School at Charlottenburg. The accused was\r\n  prosecuted and defended by counsel. He was born at Valparaiso in the\r\n  year 1883. The accusation was that, between the months of November and\r\n  January last, he had, in sixteen cases, in the public streets, cut\r\n  plaits of hair from the heads of young girls, taking also the ribbons\r\n  with which their hair was tied; this charge was one of theft. In\r\n  twelve cases also he was accused of bodily maltreatment and actual\r\n  injury. Two medical experts were present to advise the court. During\r\n  the inquiry the public was excluded from the court, but the\r\n  representatives of the Press were admitted.\r\n\r\n  The accused replied to the inquiries of the President, that he had\r\n  come to Germany in the year 1888, and that he had been at school in\r\n  Thorn, Bergedorf, and Hamburg. In Hamburg he had passed his final\r\n  examination, and had received a good report on leaving. He had always\r\n  had a special fondness for mathematics; he had studied for one term at\r\n  Munich. He had always worked very hard. He admitted that in sixteen\r\n  cases he had cut plaits of hair from the heads of girls in the streets\r\n  of Berlin. In his rooms =thirty-one plaits= had been\r\n  found.--_President_: Had you such tendencies in earlier\r\n  years?--_Accused_: Yes; at the age of sixteen years I secretly, one\r\n  evening, cut some hair from the head of my sister, thirteen years of\r\n  age, and kept it. I have always had a desire for beautiful long hair;\r\n  finally, this desire became so strong that I was unable to resist it\r\n  any longer. The first time that I cut some hair from the head of a\r\n  girl was the day of the entrance of the Crown Princess. I do not know\r\n  why I suddenly was unable to resist the impulse. It became more\r\n  powerful after I returned from a journey to South America, which I\r\n  made as a voluntary machinist. The voyage lasted five months. I had\r\n  worked very hard while on board. During the whole voyage I was in a\r\n  gloomy mood, and when I returned the impulse became continually\r\n  greater.--_President_: In what way did the impulse affect\r\n  you?--_Accused_: I frequently ran after little girls without being\r\n  able to gratify the desire to possess their hair. Then I succeeded,\r\n  amid the crowd at the entrance festivities Unter den Linden, to cut\r\n  some loose hair from the head of a girl with a pair of scissors,\r\n  without the girl becoming aware of it.--_President_: What did you do\r\n  with the hair?--_Accused_: Nothing at all.--_President_: What did you\r\n  think about while you where doing it?--_Accused_: Nothing. I simply\r\n  put the hair into my pocket.--_President_: And afterwards?--_Accused_:\r\n  Several times Unter den Linden I cut loose hair from girls’\r\n  heads.--_President_: When did you begin to cut off entire\r\n  plaits?--_Accused_: In November, at the entrance of the King of Spain.\r\n  Then, in the “Opernplatz,” I cut a plait from the head of a child; the\r\n  girl did not notice it, and I remained quiet. The plait was fastened\r\n  with ribbon.--_President_: What did you do with the plait?--_Accused_:\r\n  I took it home, combed it, and put it in a box on my writing-table, on\r\n  which was the inscription “Mementoes.” I afterwards frequently =took\r\n  the hair out and kissed it=. Often I laid it on my pillow and rested\r\n  my head on it.--_President_: Were you not fully aware that you were\r\n  doing something wrong, and that you were interfering profoundly with\r\n  the rights of another individual?--_Accused_: I did not think about\r\n  it.--_President_: If the proceedings were now to come to an end, and\r\n  if you were discharged, would you do the same thing again?--_Accused_:\r\n  I do not think that I should do it again, now that I have experienced\r\n  what the consequences are.--_President_: Can you give security that in\r\n  the future your will will be stronger than the impulse?--_Accused_: I\r\n  cannot give any guarantee.--_President_: Have you never read in the\r\n  papers that the citizens of Berlin were very much agitated by this\r\n  cutting off of girls’ hair?--_Accused_: I have read nothing of the\r\n  kind.--_President_: When were you arrested?--_Accused_: On January 27.\r\n  From a girl whose hair was plaited in two plaits I cut one plait; when\r\n  she came near me again, I wanted to cut off the other plait, and then\r\n  I was arrested.--_President_: Is it true that you put a ribbon round\r\n  each plait of hair, and marked it with the date you had cut it\r\n  off?--_Accused_: To some extent I did so.--_President_: Have you ever\r\n  had sexual relations with woman?--_Accused_: No, never. I have only\r\n  had a strong impulse to gain possession of beautiful long\r\n  hair.--_President_: Would not long beautiful men’s hair have satisfied\r\n  you as well?--_Accused_: Yes.--_Counsel for the Defence_: Did you not\r\n  have this morbid impulse in quite early youth? You told me that you\r\n  remembered the hair of many girls from the time that you were at\r\n  school in Thorn. At that time you were eight years old. You said to\r\n  me that you had thought no more about the persons to whom the hair\r\n  belonged, but only, and all the more, about their hair.--_Accused_:\r\n  That is correct. It is indifferent to me whether the person to whom\r\n  the hair belonged is young and beautiful or old and ugly: my only\r\n  interest is in the hair.--_President_: Have you the same interest in\r\n  white hair?--_Accused_: My attraction is only to fair hair.--In reply\r\n  to a further question on the part of the President, the accused\r\n  declared that he had been a very active member of the academic\r\n  gymnastic club, and that he belonged to a students’ purity\r\n  alliance.--_Counsel for the Defence_: The accused has stated that,\r\n  while he is at work, it often happens that suddenly plaits of hair\r\n  seem to appear before his eyes. He often has reveries in which it\r\n  seems to him that in all countries women and girls with beautiful hair\r\n  are at his disposal, and that he is able to rob them of their hair.\r\n  Among his colleagues the accused has always felt himself to be thrust\r\n  into the background. He had the feeling that he was =destined for\r\n  great things=, and that his comrades would not recognize this. The\r\n  accused, whose father is dead, had received assistance for his\r\n  studies; his brother is an officer at sea; one of his sisters is\r\n  mentally disordered.--Of the witnesses who had been summoned to\r\n  attend, three only were examined. Captain von W., whose daughter, when\r\n  walking in the Leipzigerstrasse, had been robbed of part of her hair\r\n  by the accused, gave evidence that the affair had had very\r\n  disagreeable consequences to his daughter. Since that time the child\r\n  had suffered from a terrible feeling of anxiety; she had experienced a\r\n  nervous shock, and frequently cried out anxiously in the middle of the\r\n  night, because she was dreaming of the plait-cutter.--The next\r\n  witness, Frau Gall, an old acquaintance of the family of the accused,\r\n  described his character as exceptionally good. All who knew him had\r\n  been astonished to hear of his actions; no one who knew him had ever\r\n  observed this passion for hair. Recently he had obviously been\r\n  overstrained mentally, and very distrait; generally speaking, he was\r\n  not high-spirited and happy, like other young fellows. According to\r\n  further evidence given by this witness, regarding the family history,\r\n  it appeared that the accused was affected with congenital\r\n  taint.--Undergraduate Schmeding, President of “the Alliance for the\r\n  Maintenance of Chastity,” had become intimately acquainted with the\r\n  accused, in consequence of their holding similar views. He described\r\n  him as having a good character, but as dreamy, melancholy, and\r\n  reserved, and unfamiliar with harmless cheerfulness and joy.--Dr.\r\n  Hoffmann, one of the medical advisers to the court, said: We have in\r\n  this case to do with a peculiar mode of activity of the sexual\r\n  impulse. Although such an impulse does not completely abrogate\r\n  responsibility, still, in this case, normal responsibility is greatly\r\n  limited from early youth onwards. The accused has an imaginative\r\n  belief that he is not sufficiently esteemed; he believes that he could\r\n  make himself invisible; he believes that he could build a great\r\n  castle, and furnish the rooms of this castle with innumerable plaits\r\n  of hair. Moreover, he is =hereditarily tainted with insanity=, and\r\n  bodily examination shows that he has =numerous stigmata of\r\n  degeneration=. § 51 of the Criminal Code should apply to this case.\r\n  Since the accused can hardly be supposed to have the power of\r\n  controlling his impulse, it would appear necessary that he should be\r\n  treated in a lunatic asylum.--Dr. Leppmann, the other medical adviser,\r\n  said: The case before us is one of extreme rarity. The accused\r\n  suffers from severe congenital taint, and exhibits a number of\r\n  stigmata of degeneration. At the time his offences were committed the\r\n  accused was certainly emotionally disturbed, and at the present time\r\n  is still ill. Von Krafft-Ebing reports only a few such cases, and the\r\n  same is true of Dr. Moll. The accused was incapable of free voluntary\r\n  determination; he is still unhealthy, and must be treated as a sick\r\n  man.--_Counsel for the Prosecution_: If the accused had been in\r\n  possession of normal mental health, it would have been necessary to\r\n  punish him with exceptional severity, for such offences as his\r\n  profoundly endangered public security; it would not be right for any\r\n  gaps to exist in our Criminal Code which made the punishment of such\r\n  an offence impossible. We may dispute in detail under which paragraph\r\n  the offence comes, but there can be no question but that it is a\r\n  punishable offence. The medical experts had, however, shown that the\r\n  accused was not fully sane, and he must be dealt with from this\r\n  standpoint.\r\n\r\n  The President summed up as follows: The public sense of justice\r\n  naturally demands severe punishment for such an offence. The accused,\r\n  however, is not criminally responsible. In view of the evidence given\r\n  by the medical experts, the accused must be discharged, on the\r\n  understanding that his family will immediately take steps to have him\r\n  confined in an asylum. It was possible that this decision would not\r\n  satisfy every one, but in view of the evidence before the court, no\r\n  other course was possible.\r\n\r\nThis case appears to have had a suggestive influence, for shortly\r\nafterwards a cashier, Alfred L., was arrested, who had cut plaits of\r\nhair from the heads of two young girls. In his home were found, in\r\naddition, seventeen plaits of hair, which he had =bought=, among these\r\nthe queue of a Chinese! Already when a schoolboy L. had been affected\r\nwith this morbid impulse.\r\n\r\nThere exist also homosexual or pseudo-homosexual hair fetichists,\r\nespecially among women, to whom the hair of another woman’s head becomes\r\na fetich. Remarkable is the following passage in Gabriele d’Annunzio’s\r\nromance “Lust” (pp. 210-212; Berlin, 1902):\r\n\r\n  “‘Do you remember,’ asked Donna Francesca (of her friend Donna Maria),\r\n  ‘at school, how we all wished to comb your hair? how we used to fight\r\n  about it every day? Imagine, Andreas, that blood used actually to\r\n  flow! Ah, I shall never forget the scenes between Carlotta Fiordelise\r\n  and Gabriella Vanni. It was maniacal! To comb the hair of Maria\r\n  Bandinelli was the one ardent desire of all the girls, great and small\r\n  alike. The infection spread through the whole school. There followed\r\n  prohibitions, warnings, severe punishment; we were even threatened\r\n  with having our own hair cut off. Do you remember, Maria? All our\r\n  heads were bewitched by the black snake which hung from your head to\r\n  your heels. What passionate tears every evening! And when Gabriella\r\n  Vanni, from jealousy, made that treacherous cut with a pair of\r\n  scissors! Gabriella had really lost her wits. Do you remember?...’”\r\n\r\n  “Andreas remarked that none of his lady friends had had such a growth\r\n  of hair, so thick, so dark a forest, in which she could conceal\r\n  herself. The history of all these young girls, in love with a plait of\r\n  hair, filled with passion and jealousy, who burned to lay comb and\r\n  hands upon this living treasure, seemed to him a most stimulating and\r\n  poetic episode of cloistral life.”\r\n\r\nThere exists also a negative hair fetichism. Hirschfeld reports the case\r\nof a prostitute who was a well-developed fetichist for baldness. Among\r\nmany races, removal of the hair is a means of sexual stimulation.\r\n\r\nNose, lips, mouth (_cf._ Belot’s novel, “La Bouche de Madame X.”), and\r\nears, can all become the objects of sexual fetichism, though in most\r\ncases only of the lesser fetichism; the eyes also, which as fetichistic\r\ncharms play an important part, and are effective especially through\r\ntheir colour. It is uncertain if, in this relationship, clear blue eyes\r\nor sparkling black eyes have the greater importance. The female breast\r\nis a natural physiological fetich for the male sex. But over and above\r\nthis there exists a remarkable variety of breast fetichists, who employ\r\nthe isolated breast, separated from the body, for the binding of books.\r\nAccording to Witkowski (“Tetoniana,” p. 35; Paris, 1898), certain\r\nbibliomaniacs and erotomaniacs have books bound with women’s skin taken\r\nfrom the region of the breast, so that the nipple forms a characteristic\r\nswelling on the cover! A further account of these human skin fetichists\r\nis given by Dr. Picard in the _Gazette Médicale de Paris_, July 19,\r\n1906.\r\n\r\nVon Krafft-Ebing contests the existence of a special “=genital\r\nfetichism=”; but the universal diffusion of the phallus-cult contradicts\r\nhis opinion; the phallus-cult is unquestionably connected with\r\nfetichistic ideas, which are embodied in the symbols of the lingam and\r\nthe yoni. According to Weininger,[629] woman, speaking generally, is\r\n=only= a phallus fetichist; man exists for her only as a sexual organ.\r\n\r\n  “I think people have been unwilling to see--or they have been\r\n  unwilling to say; they have hardly formed accurate idea for\r\n  themselves--what the copulatory organ of a man is for a woman, as\r\n  wife, even as virgin; what it psychologically signifies; how it\r\n  dominates to the uttermost the entire life of woman, although she\r\n  herself may be completely unconscious of the fact. I do not mean at\r\n  all that woman regards the male penis as beautiful, or even pretty.\r\n  She regards it as man regards the Gorgon’s head, as the bird regards\r\n  the snake--it exercises upon her a hypnotizing, magical, fascinating\r\n  influence.”\r\n\r\nGoethe lays stress on the beauty which the male penis has in woman’s\r\neyes, when, in the paralipomena to the first part of “Faust” (Weimar\r\nedition, vol. xiv., p. 307), he makes Satan say in his address to women:\r\n\r\n  “Für euch sind zwei Dinge\r\n   Von köstlichem Glanz,\r\n   Das leuchtende Gold\r\n   Und ein glänzender....”\r\n\r\nGeorg Hirth also (“Ways to Love,” pp. 566, 567) speaks of an instinctive\r\nbelief on the part of woman in the “beauty and the paradisaical force of\r\nthe phallus,” and he regrets “the unnatural depreciation and mendacious\r\nconcealment of this portion of the male body” by the conventional\r\nmorality discovered by the world of men.\r\n\r\nThe wide diffusion of the genital fetichistic tendencies in man and\r\nwoman is clearly manifested by the extremely frequent occurrence of\r\nisolated adoration of the genital organs in the practices of\r\ncunnilinctus and fellatio, which in numerous individuals completely\r\nreplace normal coitus.\r\n\r\n  Very rare is a case, which came under my own observation, of isolated\r\n  penis-foreskin fetichism in a heterosexual man. He is thirty years of\r\n  age, and a student of natural science, in whom at the age of four\r\n  years the first manifestation of sexual excitement occurred; later,\r\n  towards the age of puberty, sexual excitement became always associated\r\n  with the mental representation of a male penis, and more especially of\r\n  the foreskin of that organ, whilst he felt antipathy to the idea of\r\n  actual sexual intercourse with men, and felt attracted to women.\r\n  Still, from time to time the imaginative representation of the membrum\r\n  virile takes possession of his mind as a sort of coercive idea, and\r\n  when this happens the patient masturbates, at the same time often\r\n  making sketches of a penis.\r\n\r\nA singular case of exclusively genital fetichism is reported by P.\r\nGarnier (“Les Fetichistes,” pp. 170-174; Paris, 1896).\r\n\r\n  This case was that of a man, forty-eight years of age, who in normal\r\n  sexual intercourse was almost completely impotent, and who could\r\n  obtain sexual gratification only by the =observation of the genital\r\n  organs of human beings and animals=, and who, as in the case just\r\n  mentioned, was sexually excited by making sketches of genital organs.\r\n  This person exhibited obvious symptoms of nervous disorder.\r\n\r\nWe might regard it as hardly possible that cases should exist in\r\nwhich the fetichism related to genital organs of a dubious\r\ncharacter--“hermaphrodite fetichism”; and yet a veritable case of such\r\nhermaphrodite fetichism has come under my own observation.\r\n\r\n  The case is that of an officer, who is always searching for\r\n  hermaphroditic formations of the genital organs. He is pretty well\r\n  known in this respect among the prostitutes of Berlin, who make use of\r\n  his inclination for their own advantage, by a demonstration to him of\r\n  reputed hermaphrodites. He has had the good fortune to discover\r\n  several real hermaphrodites; but notwithstanding all his endeavours,\r\n  his affection has never been returned.\r\n\r\nThe hand, especially a woman’s hand, is not simply an object for\r\ncheiromancy, but is also the occasion of a sexual fetichism by which the\r\nhand is spiritualized. The beautiful, finely-formed hand is a powerful\r\nlove-charm. Binet reports the case of a young man in whom sexual\r\nexcitement was exclusively produced by a woman’s hand, and he was always\r\non the look-out for opportunities of touching the beautiful hands of\r\nwomen. Isolated foot fetichism is rarer; it is generally associated with\r\nthe very common shoe fetichism (_vide infra_). The buttocks, the\r\nkallipygian charms of women, have always been a sexual fetich for men.\r\nAmong flagellants this may become isolated as a fetich, and completely\r\ndivorced from the personality as a whole. For such individuals, in\r\nsexual relationships, only the posteriora exist.\r\n\r\nAmong the bodily functions which are capable of acting as fetiches, the\r\n=smell=, the emanation of the body, unquestionably takes the first\r\nplace. Smell fetichism is a very frequent phenomenon. Regarding the\r\nintimate relationships between the sense of smell and the _vita\r\nsexualis_, and regarding the existence of certain specific sexual\r\nodours, I have already recorded the most important facts in the first\r\nchapter of the present work (pp. 15-18). As sexual odours, the emanation\r\nfrom the hair of the head, the emanation from the armpits, the smell of\r\nthe genital region, and the general emanation from the skin, come under\r\nconsideration.[630]\r\n\r\nThe fetichism for red hair is frequently no more than an apparent hair\r\nfetichism; much more often it is really a smell fetichism, because since\r\nearly times red-haired individuals have been supposed to emit an\r\nemanation having a powerful sexually exciting influence. In the Romance\r\ncountries, France and Italy, this belief is universally diffused. I\r\nquote another passage from d’ Annunzio’s “Lust” (p. 66):\r\n\r\n  “‘Have you noticed the armpits of Madame Chlysoloras?’ The Duke of\r\n  Beffi indicated the dancer, upon whose alabaster forehead a firebrand\r\n  of red hair was shining, like that which we see in the priestesses of\r\n  Alma Tadema. Her bodice was fastened on the shoulders by very narrow\r\n  straps, and in the armpits one could see two luxuriant tufts of red\r\n  hair.\r\n\r\n  “Bomminaco begins to speak at large regarding the peculiar odour which\r\n  is diffused by red-haired women.”\r\n\r\nBinet tells of a student of medicine who one day, when sitting on a\r\nbench reading, suddenly had an erection of the penis, and on looking\r\nround he saw sitting on the same bench a red-haired woman, whom he had\r\nnot before consciously observed, from whom a powerful odour emanated.\r\n\r\nThe =odour of the armpits= also appears in France to find fetichistic\r\nlovers. The French cocotte commonly assumes during coitus a position in\r\nwhich the man has his nose in one of her armpits, and sometimes\r\nspontaneously offers this position. At the unrestrained dances in the\r\nParisian winter season, more especially at the very free _bal des quat’z\r\narts_, held in the spring, we frequently see the men sniffing at the\r\narmpits of the girls.\r\n\r\nIt is unquestionable that the odour of the body at large may in certain\r\ncircumstances act as a sexual fetich. Many peculiar love relationships\r\nprove this fact. From very early times among the common people the odour\r\nof sweat has been regarded as a powerful aphrodisiac. I may allude to\r\nthe case, reported by von Krafft-Ebing, of King Henry III., who dried\r\nhis face with the chemise of Maria of Cleves, dripping with sweat, and\r\nthereby was inspired with a passionate love for her. I may refer also to\r\nthe case of a peasant who, when dancing, was accustomed to dry the face\r\nof his partner with his handkerchief, which he had carried in his own\r\narmpit, and thus produced in her voluptuous excitement. An Indian king,\r\nwhen choosing his beloved, did so simply by smelling the clothing\r\nmoistened by their perspiration, and selected the woman whose clothing\r\nwas most agreeable to his sense of smell.[631] Oscar A. H. Schmitz\r\ninformed me that an English traveller in India related to him that in\r\nIndia lovers sometimes changed underclothing. Each wears the shirt\r\nimpregnated with the perspiration of the other. The love of Princess\r\nChimay for the gipsy Rigó is stated to have been a typical “smell-love”\r\nof this kind. It is said that the odour of negresses and mulattresses\r\nhas an especially powerful exciting influence upon Frenchmen, of which\r\nthe poet Baudelaire is mentioned as an example; this writer declared\r\nthat smell was the third and highest degree of voluptuousness. Recently\r\nPeter Altenberg, in “Prodromos,” has described the sexual importance of\r\nthe odour of the body at large. Such typical smell fetichists,\r\nluxuriating in the general emanation of the feminine body, are mentioned\r\nby Macé, the chief of the Parisian police. He describes very vividly\r\nhow, in the larger shops, such men move about among the feminine\r\ncustomers, in order to intoxicate themselves with the odours proceeding\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\nIn opposition to these general bodily odours, the specific genital\r\nodours play in the human species a subordinate part; they are for the\r\nmost part perceived as unpleasant. Falck[632] is of opinion that this\r\nantipathy only becomes apparent after sexual intercourse, whilst before\r\nsuch intercourse the odour of the genital organs has a slight erotic\r\nstimulating influence. Many cases of cunnilinctus and fellatio are\r\ncertainly referable to olfactory impressions. The following case is\r\nplainly indicative of the sexual influence of genital odours:\r\n\r\n  An Italian woman loved, after sexual intercourse, to retain on her\r\n  hands the odour of the genital secretions, and on such occasions,\r\n  although usually a scrupulously clean person, she avoided washing her\r\n  hands. She was especially fond of mingling this odour with that of\r\n  cigarette smoke. She was entirely free from stigmata of degeneration;\r\n  on the contrary, she was an extremely robust, well-developed person.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable and monstrous phenomena in the domain of\r\nsexual perversities is that by which the =processes and products of the\r\nultimate stages of metabolism= become associated with libido sexualis,\r\nbecome true sexual fetiches, and can more especially give rise to a\r\nformal speciality of smell fetichism. The position of the orifices of\r\nthe alimentary canal and of the urinary apparatus in the =immediate\r\nneighbourhood= of the genital organs gives rise to a certain associative\r\nconjunction between the functions of these parts, and this association\r\nis rendered more intimate by various circumstances (_cf._ my\r\n“Contributions to the Etiology of Psychopathia Sexualis,” vol. ii., pp.\r\n224, 225). In addition, the idealizing influence of libido sexualis\r\nplays a part here; the identification of the desired individual with the\r\nlover’s own ego leads the disagreeable and disgusting character of those\r\nprocesses and parts to disappear, and ultimately brings about a\r\ncomparison between the real æsthetic charm of the beloved person and the\r\ncoarsely material processes in question, which takes the form of a\r\nsensually stimulating contrast. There is not in this case any quite\r\nunusual association of ideas on the part of a completely degenerate\r\nindividual; we have rather to do with a =general anthropological and\r\nethnological phenomenon=. I was myself the first to give an elaborate\r\nproof of this fact (“Contributions to the Etiology of Psychopathia\r\nSexualis,” vol. ii., pp. 223-240); and I illuminated more especially the\r\nremarkable rôle of the so-called “=skatology=”--that is, the sexual\r\ninfluence of the ultimate products of human metabolism, and of the\r\nprocesses associated therewith--in =folk-lore=, in =mythology=, in\r\n=superstition=, and in the =literature of all nations and times=. In\r\nthis way do we first arrive at an understanding of the possibility of an\r\nerotic influence exercised by defæcation and micturition, which is so\r\noften observed at the present day; above all, in the so-called “=muse\r\nlatrinale=”--in the widely diffused practice of scribbling obscene\r\ninscriptions on the walls of public lavatories[633]--which finds\r\nexpression also in sexual “=copralagnia and urolagnia=.”\r\n\r\nCompare, in this connexion, S. Soukhanoff, “Contribution à l’Étude des\r\nPerversions Sexuelles,” published in _Annales Médico-Psycologiques_,\r\nJanuary and February, 1901--a case of urolagnia and copralagnia in a\r\nhabitual masturbator, twenty-seven years of age. A remarkable case of\r\nsexual excitement produced by the odour of newly made hay, in a lawyer,\r\ntwenty-five years of age, is reported by Amrain (“Anthropophyteia,” vol.\r\niv., p. 237). This person took off all his clothes, and rolled as if\r\nintoxicated in the hay, until ejaculation occurred. He called his\r\nimpulse a “vis major.”\r\n\r\nIt is clear that masochistic and sadistic elements play an important\r\npart in many cases of urolagnia and copralagnia. But there are pure\r\nforms of smell fetichism in this category, as we see in the case of\r\nthose persons who become sexually excited in consequence of the smell of\r\nthe urine and fæces of the beloved person; or, speaking generally, by\r\nthe smell of those excrements, the person from whom they are derived\r\nbeing a matter of indifference. These are the _renifleurs_ and\r\n_épongeurs_ of the French observers, who haunt public lavatories in\r\norder to obtain sexual excitement from the smell of the excrements of\r\npersons of the opposite sex. There even exist individuals who have the\r\nacts of defæcation and micturition performed by others on to their own\r\nbodies; in this case the masochistic element is associated with the\r\nelement of smell fetichism.\r\n\r\nA greater rôle than that of the natural sexual odours is at the present\r\nday played by =artificial perfumes=, which, as a fact, are frequently\r\nemployed as sexual fetiches. Their origin, and the cause of their use,\r\nhas been already explained (p. 17). From early times prostitution and\r\nthe demi-monde have made the most extensive use of these artificial\r\nscents for the sexual allurement of men. Men are, in general, more\r\nsensitive to sexual stimulation by means of perfumes than women are.\r\nThese perfumes are partly derived from plants; in fact, the simple odour\r\nof certain flowers produces sexual excitement--a fact well known to many\r\npeasant girls.[634] Other sexually stimulating scents are derived from\r\nthe animal kingdom, such as musk, civet, and ambergris. A French firm of\r\nperfumers advertises a perfume--“charme secret”--the local employment of\r\nwhich is clearly suggested in the advertisement. But in most cases only\r\na portion of the clothing or underclothing is perfumed. There exist\r\ntypical perfume fetichists, who can, as a rule, be sexually excited only\r\nby means of some definite perfume, in the absence of which they are\r\nimpotent.\r\n\r\nIn comparison with smell, =taste= plays a very minor part. Still, a\r\nprimevally old popular custom, the use of “priapistic flavouring\r\nagents,” rests upon fetichistic ideas of this kind. Cunnilinctus and\r\nfellatio are perhaps also committed with the desire to taste the genital\r\norgans; just as the same must be the case with those not very rare\r\npractices in which flavouring agents or beverages are brought into\r\ncontact with the genital organs, are impregnated, as it were, with their\r\nessence, and then swallowed. To this belongs also the following original\r\ncase:\r\n\r\n  A man obtains sexual gratification only in this way: by introducing a\r\n  cigar, small end first, into the female genital passage, leaving it\r\n  there a long time, and then smoking it, with the end thus impregnated\r\n  in his mouth.\r\n\r\nThere exist many other forms of fetichism. It is impossible to enumerate\r\nall these varieties. I shall, for example, refer only to the not\r\nuncommon fetichism of women for athletes and acrobats, or for singers\r\nand actors; and to that of men for dancers, and especially for\r\nhorsewomen, whose appearance has quite a fascinating influence on many\r\nmen, more particularly when they are actually on horseback.\r\n\r\nAnalogous to the previously described hermaphrodite fetichism is\r\nfetichism for other bodily defects, as for obese, lame, and hunchbacked\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n  Von Krafft-Ebing reported the case of a man who loved only girls with\r\n  a limp, which I can parallel by an observation of my own. A merchant,\r\n  thirty-two years of age (with slight stigmata of\r\n  degeneration--Darwinian pointed ears, slight asymmetry of the\r\n  skull--but in other respects with a very powerful build of body, and\r\n  having performed his year’s service in the cavalry), who since ten\r\n  years of age has been addicted to excessive masturbation, =is potent\r\n  only in intercourse with a girl who limps=. He cannot state when this\r\n  perversion first manifested itself in him. In any case, it has\r\n  developed into a typical fetichism.\r\n\r\nTo this category belong, also, the abnormal love towards =elderly=\r\nindividuals, heterosexual “gerontophilia,” and the fetichistic influence\r\nof certain peculiarities of character. Thus, it is an old experience\r\nthat a Don Juanesque, bold, and self-assertive appearance on the part of\r\nmen, and even depravity and sexual lawlessness, exercise a fascinating\r\ninfluence upon many women. This is, as it were, homologous to the\r\npreviously described influence of prostitutes and fast women upon men.\r\n\r\nA peculiar fetich is constituted also by the human =voice=. A\r\nsympathetic voice has often been the cause of a violent love passion.\r\nSingers, both men and women, know something of this powerful fetichistic\r\ncharm of the voice.\r\n\r\nFinally, sexual fetichism can extend to objects in relationship with the\r\nbeloved person, or with any human individual (“=object fetichism=”), and\r\nthis is very readily accounted for by the =personification= and\r\n=spiritualization= of these objects of human use, and especially of\r\nclothing, which appears to be a =part of the personality= itself, and so\r\nquite naturally becomes a sexual fetich. (See the detailed description\r\ngiven on p. 140 _et seq._)\r\n\r\nAmong the various forms of clothing fetichism, by far the commonest is\r\n=shoe fetichism=, or “=retifism=.” After the Marquis de Sade, who in his\r\nwritings described the most important sexual perversions, active\r\nalgolagnia has been termed “sadism”; and after Sacher-Masoch, passive\r\nalgolagnia has been termed “masochism.” I consider, therefore, that with\r\nthe same and even greater justification, as I have already suggested in\r\nmy work on Rétif de la Bretonne,[635] foot and shoe fetichism may be\r\ndenoted by the term “retifism,” for it is this sexual perversion which\r\nmanifests itself most markedly in Rétif’s life (1734-1806), and in him,\r\nalso, this perversion found its first literary interpreter and apostle,\r\nin exactly the same manner as sadism was made known in wider circles by\r\nde Sade and masochism by Sacher-Masoch. Rétif first described typical\r\nfoot fetichism and shoe fetichism, and also wrote the first history of\r\nthis subject. In him this tendency appeared at the early age of ten\r\nyears, as he relates (vol. i., pp. 90-93) in his celebrated\r\nautobiography--a work greatly admired by Goethe, Schiller, Wieland, and\r\nother heroes of our classical literature. In this place, also, he gives\r\na very good explanation of the genesis of foot fetichism and shoe\r\nfetichism:\r\n\r\n  “This fondness for beautiful feet, =which in me is so strong that it\r\n  unfailingly arouses my most powerful lust, and leads me to ignore any\r\n  ugliness in other respects=--does it arise from any physical or\r\n  emotional predisposition? In all those who have this peculiarity it is\r\n  very strong. Is it connected with any preference for an easy gait, for\r\n  a gracious, voluptuous, dancing movement? The peculiar attraction\r\n  which the foot-covering exercises is only the reflex of the preference\r\n  for beautiful feet, which stimulate even an animal. =Thus a man comes\r\n  to prize the covering almost as much as the thing itself.= The passion\r\n  which, since childhood, I have felt for such beautiful foot-coverings\r\n  was an acquired inclination, which, however, rested on a natural\r\n  preference. But the love for a small foot has a physical basis, which\r\n  finds expression in the Latin proverb, ‘Parvus pes, barathrum\r\n  grande.’”\r\n\r\nRétif was a typical shoe fetichist. He trembled with desire on viewing a\r\nwoman’s shoe; he blushed when he saw it, as if it were the girl herself.\r\nAs a true fetichist, he =collected= the slippers and shoes of his\r\nmistresses; he kissed them, and smelled them, and sometimes masturbated\r\ninto them. Especially fascinating to him were the =high heels= of\r\nwomen’s shoes, a sight of which sufficed to produce in him intense\r\nsexual excitement.\r\n\r\nShoe-fetichism existed in ancient times, and long ago it was assumed\r\nthat there was a relationship between the foot and the _vita sexualis_.\r\nReferences to this matter will be found in my earlier work,\r\n“Contributions to the Etiology of Psychopathia Sexualis,” vol. ii., pp.\r\n323-325. In modern shoe-fetichism masochistic ideas (ideas of being\r\ntrodden on, of placing the beloved’s foot on the back of the neck) or\r\nsadistic ideas (ideas of treading upon the beloved’s feet, etc.) played\r\na part; also there were associated sensations of smell proceeding from\r\nthe leather; the colour of the shoes is likewise of importance. The\r\n“foot-wooers”--thus are the shoe fetichists named in the speech of\r\nprostitutes--have the most varied inclinations in respect of different\r\nshapes and fashions of shoes. One loves ladies’ boots, another\r\nriding-boots, a third dancing-shoes, a fourth slippers, a fifth actually\r\nloves coarse wooden peasants’ shoes. Also, in respect of ornamentation,\r\ncolour, heels, etc., fancies vary. In one case known to me, a clergyman\r\nwas purely a heel fetichist. Hirschfeld records (“The Nature of Love,”\r\np. 148) the case of a man who was sexually excited only by means of the\r\nankle-wrinkles in boots; also the case of a woman who was fascinated by\r\nthe dusty boots of men, etc.[636]\r\n\r\nOf other articles of clothing, the =corset=, =petticoat=, =chemise=,\r\n=apron=, and, more especially, =stockings= and =handkerchiefs=, form\r\nobjects of sexual fetichism. Félicien Rops appears to have been at once\r\na corset fetichist and a stocking fetichist, for he frequently draws\r\nfeminine figures naked, except in respect of their wearing corset and\r\nstockings. There are many men who are able to complete intercourse with\r\na woman only when she keeps on her stockings or shoes. Others are\r\nexcited only by the articles of clothing; for instance, they represent\r\nin imagination corset shops, in order, by looking at the corsets, to\r\nproduce orgasm and ejaculation; or they collect or steal[637] feminine\r\nunderclothing, especially handkerchiefs, in order to obtain sexual\r\nexcitement from smelling or looking at these, or to masturbate with\r\nthem. Finally, there exist fetichists for particular materials, such as\r\nfur (loved especially by masochists), satin, silk, or even entire\r\ncostumes, such as a woman’s riding-dress, tights, mourning, etc. D’Estoc\r\ndescribes, under the name “la course des araignées” (“the spider race”),\r\nthe appearance of twenty women in a brothel, who were clothed only in\r\nlong black gloves reaching to the shoulders and long black stockings. In\r\nthe Berlin newspapers there recently appeared an account of the\r\nfetichism of a prince for long “gants de suède” on slender women’s arms.\r\nUnique in its kind would appear to be the case of the spectacle\r\nfetichist, of which Hirschfeld gives an account (_op. cit._, pp. 145,\r\n146).\r\n\r\n  [627] M. Hirschfeld has therefore suggested the apt name “partial\r\n  attraction” for fetichism; unfortunately, no adjective can be formed\r\n  from this term, so that for practical purposes the foreign word is\r\n  more applicable.\r\n\r\n  [628] _Cf._ Felix Baumann, “From Darkest America,” pp. 10, 41.\r\n\r\n  [629] “Sex and Character,” pp. 340, 341.\r\n\r\n  [630] In the second volume of “Anthropophyteia” (1905, pp. 445-447),\r\n  under the title, “The Sense of Smell in Relation to the Vita\r\n  Sexualis,” I have published a contribution to this interesting theme.\r\n  I addressed questions regarding the matter to various authorities; and\r\n  among the answers I obtained, I must mention more especially those of\r\n  Dr. Th. Petermann and Oscar A. H. Schmitz, to whom I owe valuable\r\n  accounts and observations, which are in part utilized in the present\r\n  chapter.\r\n\r\n  [631] Witmalett, “Man and Woman in Conjugal Union,” p. 48 (Leipzig and\r\n  Stuttgart); J.

Falck, “Treatise on Venereal Diseases.”\r\n\r\n  [633] Martial alludes (“Epigrams,” xii. 61, verses 7-10) to the\r\n  obscene “carmina quæ legunt cacantes.”\r\n\r\n  [634] Many women are sexually excited by the flowers of the garden\r\n  chestnut-tree, the smell of which resembles that of the semen of the\r\n  male. A correspondent has communicated to me several observations of\r\n  this nature from the Taunus district. G. d’Anunzio (“Lust,” p. 10)\r\n  also describes the awakening of libido sexualis in woman by the\r\n  smelling of a bouquet of flowers.\r\n\r\n  [635] Eugen Dühren (Iwan Bloch), “Rétif de la Bretonne: the Man, the\r\n  Author, and the Reformer” (Berlin, 1906).\r\n\r\n  [636] _Cf._, regarding shoe fetichism, also the work of P. Näcke, “Un\r\n  Cas de Fétichisme de Souliers, etc.,” published in the _Bulletin de la\r\n  Société de Médicine Mentale de Belgique_, 1894.\r\n\r\n  [637] The Berlin newspapers, a few years ago, were full of accounts of\r\n  such a thief, who stole underclothing (_cf._ _Berliner Tageblatt_, No.\r\n  465, September 13, 1903).

These\r\ntwo varieties of premature sexual intercourse in children must be\r\nsharply distinguished each from the other.\r\n\r\nThe alleged increase of sexual offences in which children are concerned\r\nis by von Krafft-Ebing wrongly associated with the more widely diffused\r\nnervousness of recent generations. As a matter of fact, such offences\r\nhave occurred at all times and among all peoples, with no less frequency\r\nthan at the present day. “Erotic pædophilia” is a very widely diffused\r\nphenomenon. It arises from superstitious[638] grounds; as, for example,\r\nfrom the belief which prevails in many countries that venereal and\r\nother diseases are cured by copulation with an intact child. The\r\nprimeval belief that intercourse with immature girls prolonged life,\r\nthat an emanation from them rejuvenated old men (the so-called\r\n“=Shunammitism=”[639]), led in former times, and leads even at the\r\npresent day, to acts of fornication with children. Less commonly do\r\ntimidity and impotence on the part of adult men, rendering intercourse\r\nwith adult women difficult or impossible, give rise to the seduction or\r\nrape of defenceless and unsuspicious children. The act of fornication\r\nwith children as a =popular custom= is a symptom of a primitive degree\r\nof civilization, and is therefore met with, even at the present day,\r\namong savage nations, a matter regarding which Ploss-Bartels gives\r\ndetailed accounts.\r\n\r\nPassing to consider the cause of acts of fornication with children =at\r\nthe present day=, and the means by which such acts are effected,\r\nunquestionably =opportunity= plays an important part in their\r\nproduction. All those persons who by their occupation are brought into\r\nprolonged diurnal and nocturnal association with children, and are\r\nfrequently alone with them, such as menservants, nursemaids,\r\ngovernesses, housekeepers, schoolmasters and schoolmistresses, the\r\ndirectors and other officials of orphan asylums, etc., constitute a\r\ndisproportionately large contingent of those who commit offences under §\r\n176^{3} and § 182 of the Criminal Code. This does not arise from\r\nexceptional criminality on the part of these persons as compared with\r\nthose belonging to other professions, but simply and solely from the\r\nfact that they are continually alone with children, and that any sexual\r\nexcitement which may arise is thus directed towards these, because no\r\nadult is there. Sometimes a morbid neuropathic or psychopathic\r\nconstitution plays a part; but more commonly we have to do simply with\r\nlasciviousness and sensuality, which avails itself of the opportunity\r\nthus offered.\r\n\r\nRétif de la Bretonne warned parents regarding menservants and nursemaids\r\nas seducers of children. These persons are apt to execute unchaste acts\r\nwith children =in the very first years of life=; in order to gratify\r\ntheir own voluptuousness, they play with the genital organs of these\r\npoor innocents, and thus prematurely awaken sexual sensibility, and\r\noften give rise to premature onanistic habits. These acts of impropriety\r\ncarried on with small children--which must be sharply distinguished from\r\nthose with older children, the cases being classified as relating in the\r\nfirst place to children under six years of age, and in the second place\r\nto children between the ages of six and fourteen years--are far commoner\r\nthan is usually imagined, and perhaps even more dangerous in respect of\r\nthe bodily and mental development of the child, than the second variety\r\nof unchaste acts, with older children. In most cases it is persons of\r\nthe female sex who misuse small children in this way, and often this\r\narises from the fear of impregnation resulting from intercourse with an\r\nadult man. Generally we have to do with a lascivious disposition, as,\r\nfor example, in the following cases, which came under my own\r\nobservation:\r\n\r\n  In one of these cases a woman seduced a boy four years of age to the\r\n  performance of systematic improper acts; in the other case, a boy of\r\n  five years of age was taken (_horribile dictu_) by his own mother into\r\n  her bed, and taught to perform coitus with her, in so far as this was\r\n  possible, and also to perform manipulations with her genital organs.\r\n  The little boy repeated this practice with his sister, three years of\r\n  age, and, being caught in the act, he confessed the whole history.\r\n\r\n  A boy aged four played freely with his own genital organs, and also\r\n  made peculiar coitus-like movements in bed, and in contact with his\r\n  mother. When the latter, greatly alarmed, asked him how he had learned\r\n  to do this, he explained that a young woman twenty years of age,\r\n  living in the house, had performed these manipulations with him.\r\n\r\nMagnan also reports (“Lectures on Mental Disorders,” Nos. 2 and 3, p.\r\n41) the case of a lady, twenty-nine years of age, who performed sexual\r\nacts with her nephew, aged five.\r\n\r\nThese cases rarely attain publicity, because they usually remain\r\nundiscovered. Fornicatory acts with children, such as are frequently\r\nalluded to in the newspapers, chiefly concern children between the ages\r\nof six and fourteen years. In these cases the offences are most often\r\ncommitted by schoolmasters and schoolmistresses, or by private tutors\r\nand governesses. We further often find other women undertaking such\r\nacts, displaying a sexual activity which they have no opportunity of\r\nsatisfying in intercourse with full-grown men. In the third place,\r\ndebauchees and exhausted _roués_ seek new and piquant excitement by\r\nintercourse with such _fruits verts_. Of such Laurent writes:[640]\r\n\r\n  “They have used and misused woman; they have explored all the stages\r\n  of natural and unnatural love; they have visited Lesbos and Paphos;\r\n  and they have experienced every possible sexual artificiality. Their\r\n  sexual desires have become torpid, their manliness is on the decline,\r\n  and sexual death approaches. But the more exhausted they are, the less\r\n  willing are they patiently to acquiesce in their loss. It is with them\r\n  as with inebriates who are full to the throat and still continue to\r\n  drink. One day they notice a little girl in the street and feel\r\n  stimulated by her youthful charms. Thus their love begins.”\r\n\r\nThe =blameless=, the =natural=, and the =pure=, in the essence of the\r\nchild and of the intact virgin, has a stimulating influence upon such\r\nperverted individuals: it acts as a =contrast= to their own sexual\r\nshamelessness and artificiality. The contrast, in fact, has the effect\r\nof a most powerful stimulus. Nor can we fail to recognize the existence\r\nin such cases also of a =sadistic= element in the performance of coitus\r\nwith a defenceless child, and in the sanguinary act of defloration of an\r\nimmature individual. In the eighties there flourished in England such a\r\n“=mania for defloration=,” the scandalous details of which were\r\nillustrated in a lurid light by the revelations of the _Pall Mall\r\nGazette_.[641] With regard to this sadistic element in acts of\r\nfornication with children, we must take into account the possibility\r\nthat in the corporal punishment of children by the teacher may have\r\noriginated the awakening of the latter’s sexual activities,[642] and\r\nthat in this we may find the cause of the beginning of sexual\r\nrelationships between teacher and pupil.\r\n\r\nOther not infrequent causes of the sexual misuse of children are to be\r\nfound in =alcoholic intoxication= and in =senile dementia=. =Tramps=,\r\nalso, who have for a long time been deprived of the opportunity of\r\nintercourse with women, are apt to gratify their long-repressed libido\r\non the body of the first child they meet. =Child labour in factories=\r\nalso offers opportunities for fornicatory acts with children.\r\n\r\nA few especially striking instances of acts of fornication with children\r\nare appended:\r\n\r\n  1. The son of a greengrocer, A., twenty years of age, living in the\r\n  Keibelstrasse, had for a long time immoral intercourse with the\r\n  eight-year-old daughter of the milkman W., in the same street. He had\r\n  not only violated her, but had committed other injuries. The young\r\n  fellow continued his immoral conduct after he had become infected with\r\n  venereal disease, and therefore naturally infected the girl. She\r\n  became so ill that she had to be confined to bed, and the doctor who\r\n  was called in diagnosed venereal infection. Notwithstanding this, the\r\n  little girl continued to lie about the matter, and only after a\r\n  whipping did she admit having had intercourse with A. The latter, a\r\n  man with a crippled foot, as soon as he saw that his misconduct had\r\n  been discovered, concealed himself in an outhouse, and was only\r\n  arrested by the police after a prolonged search. He is now in prison.\r\n\r\n  2. The model and friend of a painter, during the absence of the latter\r\n  from home, seduced his son, twelve years of age, after preliminary\r\n  repeated masturbation, to coitus and cunnilinctus.\r\n\r\n  3. A celebrated actress, now in advanced age, in the case of a boy who\r\n  sought a situation in her house, gave rise by various manipulations to\r\n  an erection of the penis, and seduced him to coitus; she invited him\r\n  repeatedly to visit her, and continued this scandalous practice with\r\n  him for eight years.\r\n\r\n  4. The governess Friederike B. was accused of improper conduct and\r\n  seduction of the little boy Szepsan, and was condemned to six months’\r\n  rigorous imprisonment. In April, 1900, Szepsan disappeared through her\r\n  connivance; she had him confined under false names in various\r\n  cloisters. The accused denied all blame, and declared that she was the\r\n  benefactress of Szepsan, whom she intended to bring up as a priest.\r\n  The evidence, however, sufficed for her conviction.\r\n\r\n  5. A very scandalous affair is reported by _Le Matin_. Some time ago\r\n  the Parisian police arrested a young fellow on account of an offence\r\n  against certain civil and natural laws. The accused thereupon\r\n  denounced an old Count W., and others of his friends, and also Baron\r\n  A., who daily waited the coming out of the boys from certain Parisian\r\n  schools, and then took them in his automobile to his own house or to\r\n  that of Count W. The police, having received information, kept under\r\n  observation the sons of certain distinguished families attending the\r\n  school in question, and ascertained that the statements were true. The\r\n  Count and his friends carried off the boys, among whom were three sons\r\n  of an engineer, the eldest thirteen years of age, to the Avenue\r\n  MacMahon or the Avenue Friedland. A., who is engaged to a young lady\r\n  belonging to the Parisian aristocracy, was arrested; Count W. has\r\n  escaped. The examination of their dwelling disclosed all kinds of\r\n  compromising materials.\r\n\r\nIn view of the wide diffusion of acts of fornication with children, we\r\nmust always keep one point clearly before our minds, on account of the\r\ngreat forensic importance of the matter. That is the question whether\r\nthe initiative to the improper act proceeded in the first place =from\r\nthe child=, in consequence of a =premature awakening of the sexual\r\nimpulse=. [See, for example, Emil Schultze-Malkowsky, “The Sexual\r\nImpulse in Childhood,” in the periodical _Sex and Society_, 1907, No. 7,\r\npp. 370-373. He reports five sexual scenes dating from the year 1864,\r\nthe heroine of which was a little girl seven years of age!]\r\n\r\nIn a certain proportion only of such cases have we to do with a\r\ndegenerative, morbid, inherited state; in many instances this sexual\r\nperversity occurs in children who in other respects are perfectly\r\nhealthy,[643] and is evoked by seduction, bad education, and chance\r\ncauses, such as intestinal worms, etc. This is to be observed also in\r\nchildren of savage races, among whom this phenomenon of sexual\r\nprematurity is perhaps more frequent, in part owing to climatic\r\nconditions. In the country the observation of sexual acts on the part of\r\nanimals, frequently occurring under their very eyes, makes children\r\nearly acquainted with the fact of sexual intercourse. In large towns\r\nprostitution and overcrowded dwellings, in ways to which we have already\r\nalluded in detail, give rise in many cases to a very early initiation of\r\nchildren into a knowledge of the facts of sexual life.\r\n\r\nApart from the question of child prostitution, to which we shall allude\r\npresently, we can observe such early mature types of children also in\r\nevery class of the population of large towns. Among the circles of the\r\nmiddle classes, and among the “upper ten thousand,” we have the type of\r\nthe _demi-vierge_, which recently Hans von Kahlenberg has so admirably\r\ndescribed in his “Nixchen.” In the female sex this early sexual maturity\r\nis much more clearly manifest. In an essay entitled “The Zoo as an\r\nEducator,” in the weekly newspaper _Der Roland von Berlin_ (No. 27, July\r\n5, 1906), we find a striking description of such a type:\r\n\r\n  “We find definite types of early-ripe girls, which we must regard as a\r\n  peculiar acquirement of the twentieth century. We distinguish without\r\n  difficulty the simple, hot-blooded, sensual variety from the\r\n  thoroughly developed perverse types. A short-legged, buxom type is the\r\n  most predominant. Such girls seem extraordinarily energetic, and\r\n  appear also to excel in mental powers their pale-cheeked and\r\n  half-alive male companions. Their dress is extremely conspicuous, and\r\n  they wear highly ornamented hats. Whilst, when we look at them from\r\n  behind, their whole figure suggests the age of fifteen or seventeen\r\n  years, the front view suggests that they are at least eight years\r\n  older. They prefer to lace very tightly, in order to display their\r\n  rounded hips, and to make their already strongly developed breasts all\r\n  the more imposing. But this development displays their mental and\r\n  physical corruption, especially when undeveloped shoulders and thin\r\n  arms show beyond question that they are really of a very tender age.\r\n  The sharply-cut features, with the sparkling black eyes, which at once\r\n  fascinate us, plainly indicate the lines which the passions are about\r\n  to engrave on their features; we discern, also, that by the age of\r\n  thirty they will already be old women.”\r\n\r\nSexual intercourse on the part of children with one another, or with\r\ngrown persons in cases in which the invitation has proceeded from the\r\nchild, are by no means rare occurrences. The following remarkable cases\r\nmay illustrate this:\r\n\r\n  1. Some years ago a schoolboy, K. J., thirteen years of age, was\r\n  accused in Berlin of several acts of sexual intercourse with girls of\r\n  from six to eight years. The guilt of the accused was fully proved. He\r\n  was sent to a reformatory.\r\n\r\n  2. A young man made the acquaintance of a girl sixteen years of age.\r\n  Although greatly impassioned, he did not dare to touch the girl,\r\n  because he was deceived by her sweet and blameless demeanour, and did\r\n  not wish to be her first seducer. Soon afterwards he learned that this\r\n  angel had had sexual intercourse for several years with a married man\r\n  forty years of age!\r\n\r\n  3. Legroux showed in 1890, at the weekly meeting of the physicians of\r\n  the Hospital St. Louis, a boy, eleven years of age, who, after three\r\n  months’ sexual intercourse with a syphilitic girl aged seven years,\r\n  had been infected in the ordinary manner, _per vias naturales_\r\n  (reference in _Unna’s Monatsheft für Dermatologie_, 1890, vol. x., p.\r\n  335).\r\n\r\n  4. In Paris, in December, 1906 (according to the _Vossische Zeitung_\r\n  of December 15, 1906, No. 558), a band of youthful street and shop\r\n  thieves, ten in number, of ages varying from eleven to fourteen years,\r\n  were arrested. Their leaders were a boy of twelve and a girl of\r\n  thirteen years, the latter, Eliza Cailles by name, known generally by\r\n  the nickname of “Beautiful Aliette.” This Aliette, a strikingly pretty\r\n  little person, in a long dress of extremely fashionable cut, with a\r\n  wonderful hat and most elegant gloves, ruled her band with the most\r\n  exemplary self-confidence. They were all smart fellows; =they were all\r\n  of them her lovers, and with these ten husbands she was the happiest\r\n  of wives=.\r\n\r\nActs of fornication with children also explain the melancholy phenomenon\r\nof the existence of a widely diffused =child prostitution= in all large\r\ntowns of the old and new world, regarding which, in the previously\r\nmentioned works on prostitution in these towns, detailed accounts will\r\nbe found.[644] The little flower-girls of Paris, the Berlin\r\nmatch-sellers and wax-candle-sellers or “music pupils”--all these\r\nprovide a large contingent to child prostitution. To a great extent they\r\nare associated with equally youthful criminals and _souteneurs_, and\r\navail themselves for blackmailing purposes of the existence of § 176^{3}\r\nand § 186 of the Criminal Code. Among them there are even individuals\r\ngiven to peculiar sexual “specialities,” who gratify perverse lusts in\r\nvarious artificial ways. Social misery, bad example, and seduction are,\r\nindeed, often to be blamed as causes of this early sexual depravity, but\r\nit is precisely in respect of child prostitution that Lombroso’s\r\ndoctrine of the born prostitute has considerable justification.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn exceptional cases only does =incest=--sexual intercourse between\r\nthose nearly related by blood, either in the same generation, as between\r\nbrother and sister, or in the ascending and descending line--depend upon\r\npathological causes. The origin of the dread and horror inspired by\r\nincest remains “a moot question of historical research.”[645] Within\r\nhistorical times and among savage peoples incestuous intercourse was\r\npermitted and widely diffused. Without doubt, racial hygienic experience\r\nregarding the pernicious effects of this extreme form of incest gave\r\nrise to the recognition of the fact that incest must be forbidden. At\r\nthe present day incest occurs almost exclusively as the result of chance\r\nassociations--as, for example, in alcoholic intoxication, in consequence\r\nof close domestic intimacy in small dwellings, in the absence of other\r\nopportunity for sexual intercourse. In such circumstances not\r\ninfrequently among the lower classes of the population we observe, as a\r\nfavouring factor, a complete absence of any conception of the immorality\r\nof incest.\r\n\r\nRemarkable is the tendency to incestuous unions in certain epochs--as,\r\nfor example, in the period of the French Rococo, when it was introduced\r\nby suggestion on a large scale, and manifested itself with alarming\r\nfrequency. Numerous credible historical examples of this I have recorded\r\nin my “Recent Researches concerning the Marquis de Sade” (pp. 165-168).\r\nMirabeau, and especially Rétif de la Bretonne (see my work on Rétif, pp.\r\n381-382), luxuriated in horribly blasphemous incestuous ideas.[646]\r\nAccording to Theodor Mundt, who speaks of these tendencies in his\r\nsketches of “Paris during the Second Empire” (vol. i., pp. 141, 142;\r\nBerlin, 1867), it appears that the French nature is not repelled to the\r\nsame degree as the German by the idea of sexual union between those\r\nnearly related by blood. Eugene Sue relates, in his “Mysteries of\r\nParis,” that among the lowest strata of the population fathers often\r\nhave intercourse with their own daughters.\r\n\r\nBut such things also happen in Germany. In August, 1907, a manual\r\nlabourer, forty-seven years of age, was condemned to three years’\r\nimprisonment because he had had incestuous intercourse with his\r\ndaughter, now twenty-seven years of age, during the previous fifteen\r\nyears (!), and had continued this incestuous relationship after he had\r\nhimself remarried. The girl had been for several years living in\r\nintimate sexual relationship with her father, who watched jealously to\r\nprevent his daughter having anything to do with another man. Among many\r\nIndian tribes of Central America incest is said to be always practised\r\nwhen the eldest daughter accompanies the father for a few days into the\r\nmountains, in order to prepare his maize bread for him.\r\n\r\nRelations somewhat analogous are those in which parent and child have\r\nsexual intercourse with the same person--when, for example, mother and\r\ndaughter have the same lover. Other peculiar combinations are possible,\r\nand are actually observed. Unique, however, would appear to be the case\r\nreported by d’Estoc (“Paris-Eros,” p. 209), in which a young man had\r\nsexual intercourse with a woman, with her two daughters, and also\r\nutilized the father of this family as a passive pæderast! In a\r\nmanuscript novel, which I once saw, a man was made the lover of both\r\nhusband and wife.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable of sexual aberrations, in the reality of\r\nwhich, as Mirabeau[647] remarked, it is hardly possible to believe, is\r\n=fornication with animals--zoophilia and bestiality=.[648]\r\n\r\nWe will first describe zoophilia, a sexual inclination towards animals\r\nwithout actual sexual intercourse. Genuine zoophilia, or “=animal\r\nfetichism=,” as a perversion =monopolizing= the human being’s circle of\r\nsexual ideas, is very rare. Until recently, only a single case has been\r\npublished--that recorded by Dr. Hanc in 1887, in the _Wiener\r\nMedizinische Blâtter_, and quoted also by von Krafft-Ebing. But I\r\nmyself, in the year 1905, observed a second case of genuine zoophilia,\r\nand have recorded it elsewhere.[649] This extraordinarily rare case may\r\nas well be once more detailed here:\r\n\r\n  The person concerned was a farmer, forty-two years of age, of a large\r\n  and imposing appearance, a healthy aspect, and normal conformation.\r\n  His family history did not show any points of importance throwing\r\n  light on the peculiar development of his _vita sexualis_. In the\r\n  family several unhappy marriages had occurred. The patient’s parents\r\n  had also lived in such an inharmonious marriage. His mother had a\r\n  masterful manner; he felt no love for her. He knew nothing of any\r\n  sexual abnormalities in his family. He lays especial stress upon the\r\n  fact that when an infant he was brought up on the bottle, and that in\r\n  this way he missed the first unconscious natural sexual stimulations\r\n  which, according to the theory propounded by S. Freud, proceed from\r\n  the suckling at the maternal breast. To this he mainly ascribes his\r\n  lack of sexual sensibility towards the female sex. When he was a boy\r\n  twelve years of age, the patient experienced sexual excitement for the\r\n  first time when riding on a fine horse. Since that time his sexual\r\n  sensibility as a whole has been closely connected with the idea of\r\n  fine horses, in this way, that merely to look at them produced\r\n  libidinous excitement, so that for years, once a week, while riding,\r\n  he had an ejaculation, accompanied by intense voluptuous sensations.\r\n  It is, however, remarkable that he never had any erotic dreams\r\n  connected with horses. As already stated, his sexual sensibility\r\n  regarding the human female, and also the human male, is non-existent.\r\n  His views regarding women are Schopenhauerian. The few attempts he had\r\n  made at intimate intercourse with women--in most cases these were\r\n  _puellæ publicæ_--were repulsive to him; he had on these occasions no\r\n  erection at all, or only a very slight one. The _vita sexualis_ of the\r\n  patient is, speaking generally, by no means an active one. He does not\r\n  experience nocturnal pollutions, and is completely satisfied sexually\r\n  by the weekly ejaculations and libidinous excitement which occurs when\r\n  riding on horseback. For several years the patient has suffered from\r\n  frequent insomnia, the cause of which he considered to be material\r\n  troubles combined with gloomy thoughts about his abnormal sexual\r\n  condition. Bromides, veronal, and other hypnotic drugs, are of little\r\n  use to him, for habituation soon sets in; on the other hand, cold\r\n  foot-baths have a better effect. The patient, who, as he himself says,\r\n  has a strong antipathy to normal sexual intercourse, which he regards\r\n  as a “bestial act,” believes that he might perhaps attain a normal\r\n  sexual condition if he could meet with a wife who would be\r\n  sympathetic, and would be in harmony with him mentally and physically.\r\n  He is, however, in this respect extremely sceptical, since he is well\r\n  aware of the rarity of that complete harmony which is the\r\n  indispensable prerequisite of a happy marriage. The patient exhibited\r\n  no symptoms whatever of “degeneration.” The genital organs were\r\n  normal, and nervous sleeplessness in a man forty-two years of age,\r\n  dependent upon material cares and emotional depression, cannot be\r\n  regarded as a symptom of degeneration, when we reflect how frequently\r\n  in persons who are otherwise quite healthy such nervous insomnia may\r\n  make its appearance, as a result of the struggle for life, at or near\r\n  the age of forty years.\r\n\r\nTrue zoophilia is a typical sexual perversion, and appears to occur\r\nprincipally in men. The use of animals (dogs) for purely onanistic\r\npurposes, in the way of licking the female genital organs, cannot be\r\nincluded in this connexion. In French novels and moral studies of recent\r\ntimes such types of zoophilous women are, indeed, described; thus, for\r\nexample, in Octave Mirbeau’s “Badereise eines Neurasthenikers” (1902) we\r\nfind a description of Princess Karagnine as such a perverse woman,\r\nendowed with a peculiar “passion for animals,” especially for stallions,\r\nwho caresses them with obvious signs of sexual excitement. And in the de\r\nGoncourts’ “Diary” I find the following remark:\r\n\r\n  “Every time I visit the Zoological Gardens, I am struck by the number\r\n  of bizarre, remarkably eccentric, exotic, indefinable women we meet\r\n  here, to whom the contact with the animal world of this place appears\r\n  to constitute an adventure of physical love” (Edmond and Jules de\r\n  Goncourt, “Leaves from a Diary,” 1851 to 1895).\r\n\r\nR. Schwaeblé also gives an interesting account of the zoophilous\r\ntendencies of Frenchwomen (“Les Détraquées de Paris,” pp. 203-212).\r\n\r\nUnquestionably, modern zoological gardens offer even more than country\r\nlife opportunities to women of zoophilous instincts, and can in this\r\nrespect become dangerous. I remember from my own schooldays in Hanover\r\nremarkable scenes in the much-visited zoological gardens of that\r\ntown--scenes which at that time we naturally did not really understand,\r\nbut on which the above remarks and observations throw a clear light.\r\n\r\nThus we shall no longer be surprised by the following extremely\r\nremarkable case of zoophilia in the female sex:\r\n\r\n  _Kleptomania in a Girl aged Thirteen._--A girl thirteen years of age,\r\n  who is incurably affected with kleptomania, and who at the same time\r\n  has a morbid inclination towards horses, is the most recent phenomenon\r\n  in the province of decadence. The unfortunate child is the daughter,\r\n  Frida, of a married couple living in the Höchstestrasse. She had\r\n  committed a number of thefts of vehicles, which might have been\r\n  attributed only to skilled professional thieves. The morbid tendency\r\n  compels the child to take the horse by the bridle and lead it away.\r\n  She does not appear to have any tendency to sell the animal, or to\r\n  steal anything from the carriage. Her love for horses led her in\r\n  earlier years to unusual acts. Thus she took the horse of a dairyman\r\n  in the Elbingerstrasse out of its stall, mounted it, and rode away.\r\n  The child has been under medical treatment for a long time on account\r\n  of her extremely unusual tendency, and we understand that the medical\r\n  evidence shows that she cannot be held legally responsible for the\r\n  offences she has committed (_Berliner Tageblatt_, No. 352, July 14,\r\n  1906).\r\n\r\nPassing now to consider definite acts of fornication with animals\r\n(_Sodomie_--see note ^{648} to p. 640, bestiality),[650] there is\r\nhardly any animal which has not been in some way and at some time\r\nutilized for the gratification of human lust; but naturally in most\r\ncases the animals always available were employed, such as dogs, cats,\r\nsheep, goats, hens, geese, ducks, horses. Martin Schurig, as early as\r\n1730, in his “Gynæcologia” (pp. 380-387), recorded a large number of\r\ncases of bestial aberrations in which, in addition to the animals above\r\nmentioned, apes, bears, and even fishes were employed. In antiquity\r\nsnakes were often the objects of unnatural lust on the part of women,\r\nplaying the part of the modern lap-dog. Bestiality is very widely\r\ndiffused.[651] Countries especially celebrated for the frequency of this\r\npractice are China and Italy; in the former country =geese=, in the\r\nlatter =goats=, are preferred for sexual malpractices. In India, and\r\nalso among the Southern Slavs, horses and donkeys play the principal\r\npart as objects of bestial love.[652]\r\n\r\nActs of fornication with animals are due to various causes; in\r\nexceptional cases only can they be referred to morbid predisposition. In\r\nthe lower classes of the population, and among many races--as, for\r\nexample, among the Southern Slavs and among the Persians--the\r\nsuperstitious belief that venereal disease can be cured by intercourse\r\nwith animals occasionally gives rise to bestiality. More frequently the\r\n=lack of opportunity for normal gratification= of the sexual impulse is\r\nthe cause of bestiality; and it is naturally of more frequent occurrence\r\nin the country, for the reason that there human beings live in closer\r\nassociation with animals than they do in the town. The herdsman alone\r\nwith his herd in a solitary place, the groom who in the stable suddenly\r\nfinds himself in a state of sexual excitement, the peasant whose wife is\r\nperhaps ailing--all these indulge in bestiality simply from opportunity.\r\nFriedrich S. Krauss learned from a trustworthy authority that in the\r\nAustrian cavalry Slavonic soldiers frequently gratified their sexual\r\nimpulse upon mares. When they are caught doing this, they excuse\r\nthemselves by saying that they are too poor to pay a woman. Commonly\r\nthese fellows escape punishment. In brothels, also, bestial practices\r\nare common; in some cases debauchees themselves take part in these\r\npractices, in others prostitutes make a display of bestial intercourse.\r\nFrequently, also, sadistic impulses, similar to those which find\r\nexpression in the torturing or slaughtering of animals during coitus,\r\nplay a part in bestial intercourse.\r\n\r\n  An eyewitness describes such a brothel scene, which took place in the\r\n  Via San Pietro all’ Orto at Milan. An old roué played the principal\r\n  part in this; he had become so depraved that he had sexual intercourse\r\n  with a duck, the throat of which was cut during the bestial act!\r\n\r\nSome forty years ago, in the Karntnerstrasse in Vienna, a prostitute was\r\nfound in her room, murdered, and her chambermate and professional\r\ncompanion was condemned to imprisonment as guilty of the murder. After\r\nsome years, however, the real murderer was discovered, and he was\r\ndetected by the fact that he was only able to have an erection of the\r\npenis when he killed a =hen=. He was known among the prostitutes as “the\r\nhen-man.”\r\n\r\nAnother case of sadistic bestiality was recently reported by the\r\nveterinary surgeon Grundmann, at Marienburg in Saxony (the reference\r\nwill be found in the _Berliner Tierärztliche Wochenschrift_ for\r\nSeptember 14, 1906):\r\n\r\n  A man, thirty-eight years of age, of bad reputation, one night found\r\n  his way into a byre in order to gratify his sexual desires by\r\n  intercourse with a cow. First he introduced his penis into the vagina\r\n  of a heifer nine months old; then he tried the same thing on a cow,\r\n  which threw him off, and he fell to the ground. In a rage at this, he\r\n  seized a pitchfork and forcibly thrust one of the prongs, first into\r\n  the anus of the heifer, and then into that of the cow. The cow died\r\n  speedily, whilst the heifer had to be slaughtered next day. In the\r\n  cow, in addition to a laceration of the rectum about 1-1/2 inches in\r\n  length, there was found laceration of the capsules of the right and\r\n  left kidneys, perforation of the mesentery, of the colon, of the\r\n  liver, and of the diaphragm, also a laceration 1-1/2 inches long and\r\n  equally deep in the right lung. These extensive injuries showed that\r\n  the pitchfork must have been thrust in repeatedly. The appearances in\r\n  the body of the slaughtered heifer were similar to those found in the\r\n  cow. The accused was condemned to imprisonment for two years and three\r\n  months, part of this term being for the offence against morality and\r\n  part for the injury to property.\r\n\r\nThe following extremely rare case of bestiality on the part of a woman\r\nwas seen by Krauss (_op. cit._, p. 281):\r\n\r\n  “If I can venture to credit the reports I have so frequently heard\r\n  (and it is difficult to believe that they are pure inventions), among\r\n  the Southern Slavs intercourse between women and horses or asses is\r\n  comparatively common. How they go to work in this matter I do not know\r\n  from personal observation. I did, however, once see a Chrowot woman of\r\n  ideal beauty, who =stood= at night completely naked in front of a\r\n  lighted lamp, and in this position had intercourse with a tom cat. She\r\n  experienced so intense an orgasm that she did not notice me, although\r\n  I watched the scene barely two paces from the window.”\r\n\r\nThe part played by lap-dogs in the case of many ladies has been\r\npreviously mentioned.\r\n\r\nFormerly the question was quite seriously discussed, whether a human\r\nbeing could be seduced or violated by an animal, and Hufeland relates a\r\nfantastic story of copulation between a dog and a sleeping little girl,\r\nwhich I have criticized in another work;[653] but there are, as a matter\r\nof fact, no proofs of such an occurrence, or of its possibility. In\r\nbrothels, certainly, dogs are from time to time _trained_ to have\r\nintercourse with prostitutes.[654]\r\n\r\nMuch rarer than acts of fornication with animals are similar acts with\r\n=corpses=, the so-called “=necrophilia=.” In the works of de Sade, we\r\nfind references to the algolagnistic factor of this rare sexual\r\naberration, to the sadistic or masochistic element in necrophilia,\r\ninasmuch as in the case of the dead individual we have to do with a\r\ncompletely helpless and defenceless being, who is totally unable to\r\nresist the act; sadism is also manifested in the not uncommon mutilation\r\nof the corpses;[655] and the sadistic impulse further obtains\r\ngratification from the idea of decomposition, from the smell, the cold,\r\nand the horror. In the case of necrophilia opportunity also plays a\r\npart. Soldiers and monks who are occupied in watching the dead, and who\r\nchance to be seized with sexual excitement, have gratified themselves\r\nwith female corpses.\r\n\r\nSexual acts with corpses are, indeed, not so rare as was formerly\r\nassumed, but they belong to the class of sexual aberrations regarding\r\nwhich we have but few authentic observations, most of these derived\r\nfrom French authors. Remarkable is the following recent case, which\r\noccurred in April, 1901:[656]\r\n\r\n  The following hardly credible case of necrophilia is reported from\r\n  Schonau: In the cemetery of that place Frau Maschke, thirty years of\r\n  age, was buried in the morning, but the grave was not completely\r\n  filled in. In the evening an inhabitant visited the grave of a\r\n  relative, which was close to that of Frau Maschke, and she noticed\r\n  with alarm that the top of the coffin in which the corpse of Frau\r\n  Maschke was lying was moving up and down. The discoverer of this\r\n  alarming occurrence hastened to the sexton, and reported the fact. The\r\n  sexton hurried to the cemetery with several workmen, and there, to\r\n  their horror, they surprised an inmate of the poorhouse named Wokatsch\r\n  as he was in the act of violating the woman’s corpse. The bestial\r\n  criminal was at once arrested. Soon afterwards a judicial\r\n  investigation took place, for which purpose the corpse was removed\r\n  from the grave and taken to the mortuary in order to determine how far\r\n  the criminal had actually proceeded in his attempt on the body.\r\n\r\nIn folk-lore, mythology, and belles-lettres, necrophilia plays a large\r\npart, a matter to which I have referred at greater length in another\r\nwork (“Contributions to the Etiology of Psychopathia Sexualis,” vol.\r\nii., pp. 288-296). The =idea= of intercourse with a dead body, and also\r\nthat of intercourse with an insensible human being, somewhat frequently\r\ngives rise to peculiar forms of sexual aberration. First of all in this\r\nconnexion we have to consider =symbolic necrophilia=, in which the\r\nperson concerned contents himself with the simple appearance of death. A\r\nprostitute or some other woman must clothe herself in a shroud, lie in a\r\ncoffin, or on the “bed of death,” or in a room draped as a “chamber of\r\ndeath,” and during the whole time must pretend to be dead, whilst the\r\nnecrophilist satisfies himself sexually by various acts. Cases of such a\r\nnature are reported by de Sade, Neri, Taxil, Tarnowsky, etc.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to these necrophilist tendencies is the remarkable\r\n“=Venus statuaria=,” =the love for and sexual intercourse with statues\r\nand other representations of the human person=. Here also, apart from\r\ncertain =aesthetic= motives,[657] which may predominate in the case of\r\nstatues of exceptional artistic perfection, we have to do, for the most\r\npart, with the same motives that give rise to necrophilia--sadistic,\r\nmasochistic, and fetichistic. In the case of individuals who are\r\nsexually extremely excitable, a walk through a museum containing many\r\nstatues may suffice to give rise to libido. Of this we have examples.\r\nGenerally, however, we have to do with immature, youthful, and, above\r\nall, =uncultured= individuals, who are devoid of all æsthetic\r\nsensibility, and have grown up also in a state of prudery and horror of\r\nthe nude. It is of similar persons that the Catholic moral theologian\r\nBouvier speaks, when, in his “Manuel des Confesseurs” (Verviers, 1876),\r\nhe discusses the case of masturbation before a statue of the Holy\r\nVirgin. We have previously given examples of the fact that direct sexual\r\nintercourse with a statue occurs as part of a religious fetichism and\r\nphallus cult (p. 101). In such cases the statue is taken for the\r\ndivinity, but in a profane statue-love it is taken for the living human\r\nbeing, as in the celebrated case of the gardener who attempted coitus\r\nwith the statue of the Venus of Milo. The idea of the life of the statue\r\nis even more distinctly manifest in the so-called “=pygmalionism=,” an\r\nimitation of the ancient legend of Pygmalion and Galatea, and a\r\nutilization of this legend for erotic ends. Naked living women, in such\r\ncases, stand as “statues” upon suitable pedestals, and are watched by\r\nthe pygmalionist, whereupon they gradually come to life. The whole scene\r\ninduces sexual enjoyment in the pygmalionist, who is generally an old,\r\noutworn debauchee. Canler has described such practices as going on in\r\nParisian brothels, on one occasion three prostitutes appearing\r\nrespectively as the goddesses Venus, Minerva, and Juno.[658]\r\n\r\nIn this connexion we may refer to fornicatory acts effected with\r\n=artificial imitations= of the human body, or of individual parts of\r\nthat body. There exist true Vaucansons in this province of pornographic\r\ntechnology, clever mechanics who, from rubber and other plastic\r\nmaterials, prepare entire male or female bodies, which, as _hommes_ or\r\n_dames de voyage_, subserve fornicatory purposes. More especially are\r\nthe genital organs represented in a manner true to nature. Even the\r\nsecretion of Bartholin’s glands is imitated, by means of a “pneumatic\r\ntube” filled with oil. Similarly, by means of fluid and suitable\r\napparatus, the ejaculation of the semen is imitated. Such artificial\r\nhuman beings are actually offered for sale in the catalogue of certain\r\nmanufacturers of “Parisian rubber articles.” A more precise account of\r\nthese “fornicatory dolls” is given by Schwaeblé (“Les Détraquées de\r\nParis,” pp. 247-263). The most astonishing thing in this department is\r\nan erotic romance (“La Femme Endormie,” by Madame B.; Paris, 1899), the\r\nlove heroine of which is such an artificial doll, which, as the author\r\nin the introduction tells us, can be employed for all possible sexual\r\nartificialities, without, like a living woman, resisting them in any\r\nway. The book is an incredibly intricate and detailed exposition of this\r\nidea.\r\n\r\nA comparatively common sexual aberration is “=exhibitionism=,” first\r\ndescribed by Lasègue,[659] the exposure of the genital organs, or other\r\nnaked parts of the body, or the performance of sexual acts =in public\r\nplaces=, either in order, by the public exposure, to produce sexual\r\nexcitement, or else as a result of the blind yielding to sexual impulse,\r\nregardless of the fact of publicity. In these cases we have =almost\r\nalways= to do with a =morbid= phenomenon, dependent upon =epileptic= or\r\nother mental disorders. Thus, Seiffer, among eighty-six exhibitionists,\r\nfound eighteen epileptics, seventeen dements, thirteen “degenerates,”\r\neight neurasthenics, eight alcoholics, eleven “habitual” exhibitionists,\r\nand in ten cases =various= other morbid conditions. Of the eighty-six\r\ncases, eleven concerned persons of the female sex.[660] Recently, Burgl,\r\nin a careful and critical work upon exhibitionism,[661] has suggested\r\nthe terms “exhibition” and “exhibitionism,” the former to be employed to\r\ndenote an =isolated= act of exhibition, the latter to denote the\r\n=repeated= or =customary= act of exposure of the genital organs _coram\r\npublico_. This distinction is important, because exhibition occurs in\r\nmentally healthy persons, as well as in those suffering from mental\r\ndisorder; exhibitionism, on the other hand, is, if we except extremely\r\nrare instances in debauchees not suffering from mental disorder, met\r\nwith only in insane or mentally defective individuals.\r\n\r\nIn the case of these latter we have always to do with the actions of\r\nweak-minded persons; or with impulsive actions in persons in a state of\r\nepileptic or alcoholic confusion; or, finally, with coercive ideas in\r\nneurasthenic or hysterical persons, in paranoia, in general paralysis of\r\nthe insane, or in some other form of insanity. But cases of exhibition\r\nor exhibitionism may sometimes occur from other motives in more or less\r\nhealthy persons. Among the Slavonic peoples, exposure of the genital\r\norgans or of the buttocks is frequently an expression of =contempt=\r\ntowards some one, or also an act of =superstition= (Krauss).\r\nExhibitionism as a =popular custom= occurred at medieval festivals, and\r\nalso in connexion with the “obscene gestures” of the ancients.[662] By\r\n=habituation in early childhood= the tendency to exhibitionism can be\r\nfavoured, we learn from the case reported by von Schrenck-Notzing,[663]\r\nin which the person concerned had as a boy taken part in childish games\r\nin which the children passed by one another with bared genital organs.\r\nIn his monograph upon the anomalies of the sexual impulse, which abounds\r\nin fine touches, Hoche (_op. cit._, p. 488) very rightly refers to the\r\nmanner in which the exhibitionist tendency is favoured by habitual\r\n=masturbation=. Through the practice of masturbation the =sense of shame\r\nin respect to one’s own body= is certainly destroyed, and thus, in the\r\ncase of an onanist, when some unusual impulse impells him, for example,\r\nto expose his genital organs in the presence of a person of the other\r\nsex, =certain powerful inhibitory impulses are lacking=, which, in\r\nnon-onanists, would immediately overcome this impulse.\r\n\r\nOf the two following cases of exhibitionism, that of a homosexual\r\nofficer, twenty-five years of age, is certainly the most remarkable. In\r\nyouth this patient had also masturbated to great excess, and he gives\r\nthe following report of his exhibitionist tendencies:\r\n\r\n  “As a boy seven to ten years of age (that is, before I began to\r\n  masturbate), it was a pleasure to me to go barefoot, and to show\r\n  myself to others in this way. This impulse suddenly disappeared. But\r\n  at about the age of fifteen or sixteen years (the time when I began to\r\n  masturbate) this impulse reappeared, and has continued down to the\r\n  present time. Inasmuch as time and opportunity were generally wanting,\r\n  I could only satisfy these desires in my own home, when I went home on\r\n  furlough. Since in the neighbourhood of my home I was very well known,\r\n  I endeavoured by taking extremely long walks, or by little journeys to\r\n  neighbouring parts, to reach places where I might hope to remain\r\n  unrecognized. I was accustomed on these occasions to wear a shooting\r\n  jacket and knickerbockers; the knickerbockers were wide and loose, and\r\n  of as thin cloth as possible, so that I could easily roll them up in\r\n  order that my thighs might be bare (for if the thighs remained covered\r\n  the whole affair would have given me no pleasure). Further, on these\r\n  occasions I was accustomed to wear no ordinary underclothing, but only\r\n  a nightshirt. As soon as I reached the desired place, and had hidden\r\n  the jacket, stockings, and shoes in a suitable place, the nightshirt\r\n  was arranged as a blouse. Usually I had beforehand tried the\r\n  arrangement of the dress at home. Often I went up to people who were\r\n  engaged in field labours (I was especially fond of haymakers), and\r\n  begged them to allow me to help them, which they were usually willing\r\n  enough to do. I then took off my coat and bared my feet, and then,\r\n  although there seemed no apparent reason for that, I took off my\r\n  knickerbockers, until ultimately I was in the costume above described.\r\n  I must, however, as already said, =be seen=; common people or workmen\r\n  had usually to suffice me; but when people of education (for example,\r\n  visitors at health resorts) saw me, this was what I greatly preferred.\r\n  When once one gentleman said to another, ‘Look at his beautiful legs!\r\n  what lovely legs he has!’ and I heard this by chance, I was extremely\r\n  happy. I was then eighteen years of age, but even now I look back upon\r\n  that incident with great pleasure. I also =loved to show myself\r\n  entirely naked=; in such cases I always remained quite close to a pond\r\n  or a stream, in order, if necessary, to be able to make the excuse\r\n  that I had just been bathing. Frequently, however, I lay down close to\r\n  a railway in a suitable place quite naked in an artistic posture, and\r\n  enjoyed the pleasure of seeing the trains go by.\r\n\r\n  “I commonly did this only in warm, fine weather; but I also did it\r\n  sometimes in snowy weather. When going about like this in very little\r\n  clothing, or entirely naked, I had extremely agreeable sensations. The\r\n  affair usually ended in my masturbating until ejaculation occurred;\r\n  =after which I returned, as it were, to reality. Otherwise I believe I\r\n  should never have been able to bring myself to resume my normal\r\n  clothing. For in this state I was almost insensitive to hunger,\r\n  thirst, fatigue, heat, etc.; it was, in fact, a trance-like, extremely\r\n  happy state.=\r\n\r\n  “The desire to be photographed naked came later. I should have been\r\n  extremely delighted to play the part of a naked model. I tried with\r\n  great energy in various places (Vienna, Leipzig, and Hamburg) to get\r\n  such a photograph as I wanted; but I was always turned away with a\r\n  shrug of the shoulders or a shake of the head. Finally I succeeded in\r\n  Erfurt, at a small photographer’s, in having my wish fulfilled.” (The\r\n  patient sent a copy of this photograph.)\r\n\r\nAs the description clearly shows, we have here to do with exhibitionism\r\nupon an epileptic or neurasthenic basis. The patient describes the\r\n“confusional state,” out of which he awakens to “reality,” very vividly.\r\nAn objection, however, to the idea of epilepsy is to be found in his\r\nvery complete memory of these transactions.\r\n\r\nWithout doubt, in the following case, reported by von Schrenck-Notzing\r\n(_op. cit._, p. 96), we have to do with a case of neurasthenic\r\nexhibitionism:\r\n\r\n  The patient, a portrait-painter thirty-one years of age, was accused\r\n  in the law-courts of repeated acts of exhibitionism. The imagination\r\n  and sensuality of the accused have been abnormally excitable since\r\n  earliest youth. For the last twenty years he has masturbated to\r\n  excess almost every day, with imaginative representation, when\r\n  masturbating, of male and female genital organs. In coitus he obtained\r\n  no gratification. He preferred to expose his own genital organs to\r\n  persons of the female sex, in the belief that he would in this way\r\n  produce in them sexual excitement. This exhibitionism is a central\r\n  point in his sexual life, and has acquired the character of a coercive\r\n  impulse. He is profoundly neurasthenic, and exhibits extensive changes\r\n  of character, loss of energy, lachrymosity, ideas of suicide, etc.\r\n  Exhibits signs of mental weakness. Exhibitionism is to him a complete\r\n  equivalent to ordinary sexual enjoyment, and is performed owing to an\r\n  organic compulsion. Ethically, his personality is weakened. The\r\n  accused was discharged on account of greatly diminished criminal\r\n  responsibility.\r\n\r\nAs a sub-variety of exhibitionists, we must refer to the so-called\r\n“=frotteurs=,” individuals who rub their genital organs, either bared or\r\ncovered, against persons of the opposite sex, and thus obtain sexual\r\ngratification. In their case also we almost always have to do with\r\nmorbid conditions. The following case (_Vossische Zeitung_, No. 258,\r\nJune 6, 1906) was recently observed in Berlin:\r\n\r\n  The architect, Eduard P., was accused of offences committed in the\r\n  opera-house of Berlin. In February and March, 1906, he had repeatedly\r\n  soiled ladies’ clothing in a disgusting manner. At a time when the\r\n  ladies had their whole attention directed to the stage, the offender,\r\n  standing or sitting behind them, contaminated their clothing, and\r\n  disappeared in the next interval. The whole mode of procedure\r\n  suggested the activity of a man with an abnormal morbid\r\n  predisposition, who in this place yielded to certain perverse\r\n  impulses. Several complaints having been made, some detectives were\r\n  dispersed through the audience, until finally the accused was caught\r\n  in the act. During the second act of a performance of “Lohengrin,” the\r\n  detective Brumme observed the accused pressing up from behind against\r\n  a lady, and, in the semi-obscurity of the performance, acting in the\r\n  manner already mentioned. P. was arrested, and admitted that he had\r\n  repeatedly acted in this way. Before the judge the accused also\r\n  confessed that he had done the same thing on other occasions. How he\r\n  had been led to do it he could not say. Each time after committing the\r\n  offence he had suffered very bitter remorse.\r\n\r\nThe accused was acquitted of the criminal charge on the ground of mental\r\ndisorder.\r\n\r\nThe psychical element of exhibitionism also plays a part in the practice\r\nof the so-called “=voyeurs=”[664] and “=voyeuses=,” that numerous group\r\nof male and female individuals who are sexually excited by =regarding=\r\nthe sexual acts of other persons (active _voyeurs_), or who =allow\r\nthemselves to be watched= by others when themselves performing sexual\r\nacts (passive _voyeurs_). In many brothels, apertures in the wall or\r\nother arrangements have been made for these _voyeurs_ or _gagas_,\r\nthrough which they watch sexual scenes. In fashionable dressmakers’\r\nshops, men are also said to watch ladies trying on dresses--at least, so\r\nI have been informed by a Parisian. Recently women also have been more\r\nand more inclined to see such spectacles, so that Schwaeblé devotes a\r\nspecial chapter to the _voyeuses_ in his book on the perverse women of\r\nParis. Messalina compelled her court ladies to prostitute themselves in\r\nher presence. Not infrequently male and female _voyeurs_ unite to form\r\nsocieties and =secret sexual clubs=, in which all the sexual acts are\r\nperformed in public.\r\n\r\n  Thus, in the end of September, 1906, in Graz, a “Secret Society for\r\n  Immoral Purposes” was discovered by the police. At the head of this\r\n  club was a merchant, thirty years of age, B----, jun. A number of\r\n  other persons of good position belonged to this sexual club. They met\r\n  in the great restaurant “Zum Königstiger.” Under the title of “An\r\n  Assembly of Beauty,” festivals were held in the magnificent garden of\r\n  this restaurant, which were concluded as orgies behind closed doors.\r\n  The beautiful gardens of the Schlossberg were also the scene of many\r\n  meetings of the club.[665]\r\n\r\nA remarkable category of _voyeurs_ is constituted by the so-called\r\n“=stercoraires platoniques=,”[666] individuals who obtain sexual\r\nenjoyment by observing the acts of defæcation and micturition performed\r\nby persons of the other sex, and seek opportunities for such\r\nobservations in brothels or public lavatories. In the closet of one of\r\nthe Berlin railway-stations such a _stercoraire_ recently made a small\r\nartificial opening in the wall, through which he was able to watch other\r\npersons when engaged in the act of defæcation!\r\n\r\nHere also we may refer to =heterosexual pædication=, to _coitus analis_,\r\nwhich, according to the reports of French authors (Tardieu, Martineau,\r\nand Taxil), appears to be especially common in France, but which is by\r\nno means rare also in other countries. It becomes comprehensible only in\r\nview of the fact that the anus may itself be an erogenic zone. Details\r\nregarding this matter are given by Freud.[667] Krauss, also, in the\r\nsecond volume of his “Anthropophyteia” (p. 392 _et seq._), has given\r\nnumerous examples of pædication. Among others, he reports two cases\r\nrelated to him by the ethnologist Friedrich Müller, in which men had\r\ncoitus with their wives only _per anum_.\r\n\r\nFinally, we must refer to a practice which appears to be confined to\r\nFrance, the =customary use of opium, hashish, and ether, for the purpose\r\nof inducing sexual excitement=, regarding which Schwaeblé (_op. cit._,\r\npp. 19-36) and d’Estoc (_op. cit._, pp. 151-158) give very interesting\r\nreports. There exist in Paris special opium-houses, hashish-houses, and\r\nether-houses, some for men and some for women. Three opium-houses are to\r\nbe found, for example, in the Avenue Hoche, the Avenue Jéna, and the Rue\r\nLauriston; there is an ether-restaurant in Neuilly; one for opium,\r\nhashish, and ether in the Rue de Rivoli. All these means of enjoyment\r\nevoke after a time sexual ideas and fantasies of an extremely peculiar\r\ncharacter, associated with actual voluptuous sensations. Opium gives\r\nrise to “ardent, brilliant pictures of an excessively stimulated\r\nimagination,”[668] frequently of a perverse character; hashish has a\r\nsimilar but even stronger influence; and ether gives rise to a more\r\npowerful stimulation of the sexual organs, to a “vibration of the flesh\r\nand of the soul.” The interior of these unwholesome places of exotic\r\nenjoyment, in which frequently homosexual acts also occur, is vividly\r\ndescribed by both the above-named French authors.[669]\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nTHE TREATMENT OF SEXUAL PERVERSIONS\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of sexual perversions and anomalies, always a matter of\r\ngreat difficulty, knowledge of mankind, tact, and the finer\r\nunderstanding of the physician for the psychological peculiarities of\r\neach individual case, must play a greater part than any definite method\r\nof medical treatment. An exact understanding of the true =nature= of the\r\nsexually abnormal personality is the indispensable preliminary to our\r\nexercising a favourable influence upon morbid impulses and practices.\r\nUnquestionably, the physician must in the first place treat all =actual\r\ndiseases underlying the sexual abnormalities=, by means of the physical\r\nand pharmacological therapeutical methods open to us in such abundance.\r\nBodily and mental =repose= is here often the first need we have to\r\nsatisfy; and for this purpose a change of environment, climatic cures,\r\nand such drugs as bromide and camphor may be very useful. But the\r\nprincipal matter must remain =psychical, suggestive= treatment. The mere\r\n=discussion= of the matter with the physician, the possibility at length\r\nof confiding in one capable of taking a thoroughly objective, calm,\r\ncomprehensive view of the matter, one who by his profession is\r\ninstructed in all secrets of the human spiritual and impulsive life, and\r\nwho is aware of all the bodily necessities--this by itself suffices to\r\nrestore to these unhappy beings, who are tortured by the evil demon of\r\ntheir unhappy impulse, who are often in a state of spiritual despair and\r\nhypochondria, to restore to them an inward confidence and a healing\r\nrepose. This is the great triumph of medical research in this hitherto\r\ntabooed, and yet so enormously important, department, which only crass\r\nignorance or evil-minded hypocrisy could designate as “improper” or\r\n“unworthy.” We have passed beyond the fruitless and dangerous method of\r\n“moral preaching,” to attain a =scientific understanding= of sexual\r\nanomalies; we have exposed the roots of these anomalies, lying deep in\r\nthe physical and psychical nature of humanity, and we have recognized\r\ntheir connexion with so many other phenomena of the civilization of our\r\ntime. When I speak of a “treatment” of the common, widely diffused\r\nsexual anomalies, it appears to me that that standpoint is the best\r\nwhich regards them as pure =diseases of the will=, which have been\r\ndiffused in all times, but have never been more distinctly manifest, and\r\nnever have possessed more importance, than they do at the present day,\r\nwhen will, energy, has become the most important weapon in the ever\r\nmore violent struggle for existence. As Napoleon III. said, it is not to\r\nthe apathetic man, but to the =energetic= man, that the future belongs,\r\nto the man with the will of iron. But nothing paralyzes the will so much\r\nas the dominance of blind and, above all, of =abnormal=, impulses.\r\nUnquestionably they conceal within themselves, when frequently\r\ngratified, feelings rather of pain than of pleasure, and become the\r\nunconquerable source of hypochondria and self-contempt. The stronger the\r\nimpulse becomes, the longer the habit has lasted of yielding to that\r\nimpulse, the greater is the loss of will from which the individual\r\nsuffers. The first and most important task of the physician is,\r\ntherefore, to weaken the impulse by means of strengthening the will. He\r\nmust consistently and methodically =educate the will=, in order to\r\nassist the patient to obtain the victory over his impulse. As Goethe\r\nsays in his “Epimenides”:\r\n\r\n   “Noch ist vieles zu erfüllen,\r\n    Noch ist manches nicht vorbei:\r\n    Doch wir alle, durch den =Willen=\r\n    Sind wir schon von Banden frei.”\r\n\r\n  [“Much there remains to fulfil,\r\n    Many things have yet to be endured:\r\n    Still, all of us, by the exercise of =will=\r\n    Can to a large extent free ourselves from our fetters.”]\r\n\r\nThe best way to attain this is to employ =personal influence= by means\r\nof =suggestion=. We must recommend frequent =conversations= on the part\r\nof the patient with the physician, which can be powerfully supplemented\r\nby =epistolary communications= on the part of the physician, of which an\r\nexcellent example will be found in the “Psychotherapeutic Letters” by H.\r\nOppenheim (Berlin, 1906).[670] =Hypnosis= is also of value, although it\r\ndoes not appear to do any more in these cases than is effected by\r\nsuggestion in the waking state.[671]\r\n\r\nIt is not so easy to transform a Hamlet into a man of action. We must\r\nimpose tasks upon the will, tasks both mental and physical; we must\r\nregulate the mode of life; we must give to the individuality special\r\nprescriptions adapted to the particular case, and we must call to our\r\nassistance, whenever advisable, the friends and associates of our\r\npatient. The great enemy of the will, alcohol, must be absolutely\r\nprohibited; on the other hand, the taste for finer enjoyment and also\r\nfor easy sports and pastimes must be stimulated.[672] The _vita\r\nsexualis_ needs repose in every case, and, above all, masturbation must\r\nbe energetically resisted. If we succeed in diminishing the intensity of\r\nthe impulse, and in increasing the power of the will, we have already\r\ndone much. In isolated cases, we must also always make the attempt to\r\nconduct the libido and its activity very gradually into normal channels,\r\nperhaps with the assistance of suggestive ideas _in coitu_, for which,\r\nabove all, the assistance of the sexual partner is indispensable. Only\r\nan experienced physician can here hit the mark.\r\n\r\n  [638] The Public Prosecutor Amschl reports in the _Archives for\r\n  Criminal Anthropology_, 1904, vol. xvi., p. 173, a gross case of this\r\n  character, in which a peasant affected with venereal ulcers, having\r\n  been advised that a cure could only be obtained by intercourse with a\r\n  pure virgin, had sexual intercourse with his own daughter, and--was\r\n  cured!!\r\n\r\n  [639] See 1 Kings i. 1-4.\r\n\r\n  [640] E.

Frank, “System of a Medical Polity,” vol. vi., pp. 94, 95\r\n  (Frankenthal, 1792).\r\n\r\n  [643] _Cf._ Sollier’s remarks on this subject in Von\r\n  Schrenck-Notzing’s “Die Suggestions-Therapie,” p. 7.\r\n\r\n  [644] Regarding child prostitution in Berlin, numerous details are to\r\n  be found in the work, “Child Prostitution in Berlin: Unvarnished\r\n  Revelations and Moral Pictures by an Initiate” (Leipzig, 1895).\r\n\r\n  [645] G. Schmoller, “Elements of General Political Economy,” vol. i.,\r\n  p. 233 (Leipzig, 1901).\r\n\r\n  [646] Such relations can become actual, even at the present day, as we\r\n  learn from the case reported by the Public Prosecutor, Dr. Kersten, in\r\n  the _Archives for Criminal Anthropology_ (1904, vol. xvi., p. 330), of\r\n  a Moor, sixty-five years of age, who, in intercourse with his\r\n  step-daughter, procreated a daughter, and later with this daughter of\r\n  his own, when she was thirteen years of age, had sexual intercourse!\r\n\r\n  [647] G. Mirabeau, “Erotika Biblion,” p. 91 (Brussels, 1868).\r\n\r\n  [648] German authors use the word _Sodomie_ to denote sexual\r\n  relationships between human beings and animals. Mr. Havelock Ellis\r\n  informs me (in a private letter) “the German use of ‘sodomy’ to\r\n  include ‘bestiality’ is quite ancient, and no doubt had a theological\r\n  origin. I imagine the confusion was made with the idea of throwing on\r\n  to ‘bestiality’ the same reprobation as the Bible metes out to\r\n  ‘sodomy.’” There is, of course, no mention of bestiality in connexion\r\n  with the destruction of Sodom. The sin for which the city was\r\n  destroyed was the desire for carnal knowledge of the two angels in the\r\n  house of Lot (Gen. xix. 5). The signification of the various terms\r\n  used to denote unnatural intercourse is thus defined by Mann, in his\r\n  work on “Forensic Medicine”: =Sodomy= means unnatural sexual\r\n  intercourse between two human beings, usually of the male sex....\r\n  =Tribadism=, the gratification of the sexual instinct between two\r\n  human beings of the female sex.... =Pederastia= is that form of sodomy\r\n  in which the passive rôle is played by a boy, the active agent being\r\n  man or boy. =Bestiality= means sexual intercourse between mankind and\r\n  the lower animals. Generally speaking, in this translation the terms\r\n  mentioned are used as above defined. If there is any variation from\r\n  that use, the context will manifest it. In any case, =Sodomy= has\r\n  never been employed in the translation as an equivalent of the German\r\n  _Sodomie_, the latter term having been invariably rendered by\r\n  =Bestiality=.--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n  [649] Iwan Bloch, “A Remarkable Case of Sexual Perversion\r\n  (Zoophilia),” published in _Medizinische Klinik_, 1906, No. 2.\r\n\r\n  [650] Of the recent literature on this subject I may refer to G.\r\n  Dubois-Dessaulle, “Étude sur la Bestialité au Point de Vue Historique,\r\n  Médical, et Juridique” (Paris, 1905); F.

A very\r\n  painstaking and critical study of unnatural fornication with animals\r\n  is published by Haberda in the _Vierteljahrsschrift für Gerichtliche\r\n  Medizin_, 1907, vol. xxxiii., supplementary number. It deals with 162\r\n  medico-legal cases. Among these, two only concern girls of sixteen and\r\n  twenty-nine years of age respectively, persons who have had improper\r\n  relations with dogs. Most of the male offenders were =persons whose\r\n  occupations brought them much into contact with domestic animals=;\r\n  about half of them were under twenty years of age. The animals\r\n  concerned were cattle, goats, horses, dogs, pigs, sheep, and hens. In\r\n  the majority of cases there were fornicatory acts--acts analogous to\r\n  sexual intercourse--less commonly other sexual contacts. The girl of\r\n  sixteen was caught in the act of intercourse with a dog. The majority\r\n  of male offenders made use of female animals. In two cases young men\r\n  allowed dogs to have intercourse with them _per anum_, the dogs having\r\n  been trained to do this, and in both of them were found lacerations of\r\n  the anus and rectum. Only in a few of the 172 cases of bestiality was\r\n  there any reason to doubt the mental integrity of the person\r\n  concerned. In those cases there was senile dementia, epilepsy, or\r\n  alcoholism. The principal causes for the practice of bestiality were\r\n  enhanced opportunities, the lack of possibility in the country for\r\n  conjugal or extra-conjugal normal sexual intercourse, or, finally,\r\n  superstition (belief in the possibility of curing of venereal disease\r\n  by intercourse with animals).\r\n\r\n  [651] Regarding the ethnology of bestiality, consult my “Etiology of\r\n  Psychopathia Sexualis,” vol. ii., pp. 272-276.\r\n\r\n  [652] _Cf._ F.

A man compelled his wife, who was amiable but\r\n  somewhat weak-minded, to have intercourse with a male pointer, which\r\n  he himself prepared for the act, and in course of time he made the\r\n  animal complete coitus with his wife five or six times whilst he\r\n  looked on (“A Horrible Case,” published in the _Archives for Criminal\r\n  Anthropology_, vol. xiii., pp. 320, 321). A case of bestiality with a\r\n  rabbit is reported by Boëteau (“Un Cas de Bestialité,” published in\r\n  _France Médicale_, 1891, vol. xxxviii., p. 593). Regarding passive\r\n  bestiality with dogs, _cf._ A.

In\r\n  Southern Slavonic countries the corpses of young women and girls were\r\n  sometimes found which had been disinterred. The necrophilist had\r\n  misused them sexually, and had then cut off the breasts and torn out\r\n  the intestines (F. S. Krauss, “Anthropophyteia,” vol. ii., p. 391). In\r\n  the fifth decade of the nineteenth century the notorious necrophilist\r\n  Sergeant Bertrand performed similar acts.\r\n\r\n  [656] Reported by A. Eulenburg, “Sadism and Masochism,” p. 56. Another\r\n  case of necrophilia, with subsequent mutilation, occurred during the\r\n  night of December 21-22, 1901, in the mortuary at Weiher, on the\r\n  corpse of the wife of a day-labourer. The offender, who was arrested,\r\n  had, on account of intense sexual hyperæsthesia, committed other\r\n  sexual offences, among them bestiality (_cf._ “A Case of Necrophilia,”\r\n  published in the _Archives of Criminal Anthropology_, 104, vol. xvi.,\r\n  pp. 289-303).\r\n\r\n  [657] These æsthetic motives were predominant in the cases of\r\n  statue-love reported from antiquity.\r\n\r\n  [658] _Cf._ L. Fiaux “Les Maisons de Tolérance,” pp. 176, 177 (Paris,\r\n  1892).

Wernichs\r\n  (“Geographico-Medical Studies,” pp. 48-50), elucidate very exactly the\r\n  nature of the sexual fantasies of the opium-smoker, which have the\r\n  character of an indeterminate and by no means coercive sexual desire:\r\n  “It is not necessary to proceed to gratification; one is almost\r\n  disinclined to bring the series of beautiful pictures to an end in\r\n  this way. All the joyful sexual experiences follow one another in a\r\n  peculiar and fanciful admixture. Alluring forms appear in the most\r\n  stimulating postures. Often one does not seem to take part in the\r\n  matter oneself. Beautiful women whom one has seen in any part of the\r\n  world, at the theatre, etc., move before one’s eyes, in the most\r\n  beloved games of our youth. Everything that memory and the half-dream\r\n  brings us is naked, shining, delicate, luxurious--and for us alone;\r\n  for me these groupings, these fountains with bathing forms, these\r\n  gestures, these embraces.” It is, therefore, not simply by chance that\r\n  the majority of Chinese brothels have arrangements for opium-smokers,\r\n  and that, contrariwise, many opium-dens provide opportunities for\r\n  sexual enjoyment. Indeed, prostitutes are said to prefer\r\n  opium-smokers, precisely because the latter, as long as the effect of\r\n  the opium persists, do not come to an end of their enjoyment.\r\n\r\n  [These sexual fantasies of the opium-smoker probably occur only in the\r\n  initial stages of indulgence in the drug. The =confirmed=\r\n  opium-smoker, like the man habituated to the hypodermic injection of\r\n  morphine, is probably, with rare exceptions, completely impotent.\r\n  Sexual appetite and power return, however, when the habit is\r\n  cured.--TRANSLATOR.]\r\n\r\n  [670] I refer more especially to the last letter, one directed to an\r\n  onanist (pp. 42-44), as instructive in this connexion.\r\n\r\n  [671] _Cf._ also Alfred Fuchs, “Therapeutics of the Abnormal Sexual\r\n  Life in Men” (Stuttgart, 1899).\r\n\r\n  [672] In such cases music, more especially the more emotional music of\r\n  Wagner, must be employed only with great care.\r\n\r\n  SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE.--With regard to offences against morality, see the\r\n  comprehensive work by Mittermaier, “Crimes and Offences against\r\n  Morality” (Berlin, 1906) (gives a comparative description of the\r\n  legislation of various countries).

SALGÓ.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS OF CHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n  Importance of sexual perversions to the State and to society --\r\n  Exaggerated views regarding their injurious influence -- One-sided\r\n  condemnation of them from the forensic-psychiatric standpoint -- Their\r\n  wide diffusion among healthy individuals -- Protection against real\r\n  injury to public and private interests from sexual offences -- Their\r\n  frequency among diseased persons -- The idea of degeneration --\r\n  Congenital taint and the stigmata of degeneration -- Significance of\r\n  these stigmata -- Social causes of degeneration -- Significance of\r\n  tattooing -- § 51 of the Criminal Code -- The idea of “diminished\r\n  responsibility” -- Characterization of sexual emotions -- Other\r\n  factors lessening responsibility (menstruation, etc.) -- Points of\r\n  view in the punishment of acts of fornication with persons under age\r\n  -- Value of the evidence of children in the law-courts -- The age of\r\n  consent -- The condemnation and punishment of sexual offences.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nIt is the evident duty of the State to protect society from certain\r\nmanifestations of the sexual impulse, occurring publicly in the form of\r\n“=offences against morality=,” and whenever these manifestations\r\n=interfere= with the persons and the rights of citizens. The sexual\r\nimpulse has been compared with a powerful stream, which, when confined\r\nto its natural bed, is a never-ending source of blessing to the\r\nsurrounding country; but which, as soon as with elemental force it\r\noverflows its banks and gives rise to widespread floods, is the cause of\r\nunspeakable misery among the entire population.[673] This comparison\r\nwould be just if the facts were as stated. But, as I have already\r\npointed out, =as a whole=, sexual perversions have played a far smaller\r\npart in the decadence of fallen nations than has hitherto been assumed.\r\nThe biological and economical history of civilization has taught us to\r\nrecognize numerous other influences, which, in such a process of\r\nnational decay, play at least as great a part as sexual “degeneration,”\r\nand in many cases a much greater part than this. Frequently, indeed,\r\nsexual perversions and unnatural modes of gratification of the sexual\r\nimpulse are =in the first place a consequence of economic and social\r\nabnormalities=, and are intimately connected with the so-called social\r\nproblem. The above-named stream, to pursue the image, only trickles over\r\nits banks here and there, without giving rise to any widespread and\r\ndevastating flood. And so long as these destructive tendencies are\r\nwanting, the State has no right to take measures against sexual\r\nperversions, or at most can justly do so only by dealing with their\r\nsocial causes. In view of the extensive diffusion of sexual anomalies\r\namong persons who in other respects are perfectly healthy, we must ask\r\nourselves whether the importance of these anomalies, in respect of the\r\noffences against morality to which in certain circumstances they may\r\ngive rise, has not been overestimated. This idea has recently been put\r\nforward by J. Salgó, in his valuable monograph, “The Forensic Importance\r\nof Sexual Perversities” (Halle, 1907). I am more especially pleased to\r\nfind that this author shares the view which I have myself advocated for\r\nyears, that sexual perversities in the majority of cases are not\r\nindications of “degeneration,” as has been assumed both by psychiatrists\r\nand neurologists, especially under the influence of the doctrine of\r\nMöbius, who pushed this idea much too far. Moreover, the late Jolly, in\r\nhis lectures to practising physicians upon sexual aberrations, expressly\r\nmaintained the justice of my view of sexual anomalies as an\r\nanthropological phenomenon. With regard to the nature of sexual\r\nperversions, psychiatric science will have greatly to modify its general\r\nviews, in order to attain an objective consideration of their\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\n  “=Psychiatry=,” says Salgó (_op. cit._, pp. 37, 38), “=must not follow\r\n  the decoy-call of the law (which has wandered into a blind alley), by\r\n  endeavouring to cover with the mantle of specialist science the\r\n  serious legal errors in the matter of perverse sexuality. The\r\n  incontestable domain of psychiatric experience in forensic questions\r\n  is already sufficiently large, and it needs no artificial extension.\r\n  But it is an artificial extension to indicate as morbid all the\r\n  aberrations of sexual activity, or any single one of such aberrations,\r\n  in the absence of indubitable or demonstrable symptoms of physical\r\n  disturbance, and in the absence of a clearly recognizable and abnormal\r\n  course--simply because they contravene the existing criminal law.=”\r\n\r\nThe blind alley of psychiatry is the prison and the asylum. Because\r\npsychiatry is principally concerned with those sexual perversities which\r\nhave criminal or psychiatric importance, with the =abnormalities= and\r\nthe =crimes= of the sexually perverse, psychiatric science failed to\r\nrecognize the extraordinarily wide diffusion of sexual perversions among\r\npersons who are mentally and physically healthy. Among the healthy,\r\nhomosexuality, sadism, masochism, fetichism, etc., may make their\r\nappearance in more or less severe forms; just as other “vicious habits”\r\nmay occur in the healthy, just as passionate tobacco-smoking, or\r\nintoxication with any sport, may become =an ineradicable habit=, or at\r\nleast a =habit extremely difficult to eradicate=. Neither jurisprudence\r\nnor psychiatry can be spared the accusation of having misled “public\r\nopinion,” this terrible monster so often hostile to civilization, in\r\nrespect of sexual perversities, regarding whose nature recent scientific\r\nresearch, and above all, anthropological research, has diffused a light.\r\n=I am acquainted with a number of persons whose bodily and mental health\r\nis excellent, persons who are, indeed, imposing in respect of their\r\nprimeval German racial force, who have assured me that they suffer from\r\nthe most severe sexual perversions!= Recall the description given on p.\r\n584 of a masochistic “slave” of the most extreme type. I do not go so\r\nfar as Salgó, who demands for sexual anomalies, in so far as they are\r\nnot criminal, the same “right of existence” (p. 7) as for the normal\r\nsexual impulse; but I do assert that sexual anomalies exist in\r\nindividuals who are in other respects perfectly healthy, and that they\r\ndo not always injure the personal health or the bodily and moral\r\nwell-being of another, as is the case with sexual perversions arising\r\nupon a morbid foundation and attaining forensic importance. Above all, I\r\nmust sharply condemn the fashion of =glorifying= sexual perversities,\r\nwhich have been regarded as a peculiar privilege of the highest mental\r\ndevelopment, and as corresponding to an especial refinement of\r\nsensibility. This assertion may be refuted by reference to the fact,\r\noften mentioned before, that the most incredible and most artificial\r\nsexual malpractices occur among savage races, who in this respect could\r\ngive points to our modern decadents and epicurean æsthetes. In any case,\r\nsexual perversions in themselves have neither a moral nor a forensic\r\nimportance, and must be regarded as more or less biological variations\r\nof the normal impulse.\r\n\r\nWhere, on the other hand, the =public= or =individual= interest is\r\ninjured by these perversions, the State has unquestionably the right of\r\nintervention and the right of prevention. In every case in which we have\r\nto do with the production of a public nuisance, with the bodily or\r\nmental injury of other human beings, with the employment of force, with\r\nthe misuse of the lessened or absent responsibility of children, of\r\nunconscious persons, of those asleep, and of those mentally disordered,\r\nsociety must intervene in its own interest, and must take suitable\r\nmeasures to protect itself against such offences. Now, it is\r\ncertain--and to have established this is an honour to psychiatric\r\nscience--that it is precisely these latter sexual =offences= which in\r\nthe great majority of cases are committed by =diseased= persons and by\r\nthose who are more or less =irresponsible=. Therefore, we are thoroughly\r\njustified in demanding that in every such criminal case, the bodily and\r\nmental condition of the accused should be subjected to a medical\r\nexamination. A typical mental disorder, such as imbecility, epilepsy,\r\nalcoholic insanity, general paralysis of the insane, paranoia, etc.,\r\nwill be detected without difficulty, and thereby responsibility will at\r\nonce be excluded. More difficult are the =transitional= stages between\r\nhealth and disease, the so-called “=borderland cases=,” the cases of\r\n“psychopathically deficient responsibility” and of “disequilibrium.” In\r\nforensic medicine two ideas play a very great part in this connexion,\r\nthat of “=degeneration=” and that of “=diminished responsibility=.”\r\n\r\nEvery sexually perverse person must be examined for signs of severe\r\nhereditary taint, as well as for the so-called “stigmata of\r\ndegeneration.” If we can prove that in his family there have been\r\n=several= instances of =severe= mental disorder, of alcoholism,\r\nsyphilis, diabetes, and other diseases leading to degeneration, the\r\nsuspicion that there is a psychopathic foundation for the sexual offence\r\nis justified. But we must insist that congenital taint does not make\r\nitself felt in every case, and cannot, therefore, always be made\r\nresponsible as a causal influence in the production of a sexual\r\nperversion.[674]\r\n\r\nThe so-called “stigmata of degeneration” have importance only when they\r\nare =very markedly= developed, and when =several= of them are\r\nsimultaneously present. We distinguish physical and mental _stigmata\r\ndegenerationis_. To the former belong disturbances and inhibitions of\r\ndevelopment, malformations, such as asymmetry of the skull, narrowness\r\nof the palate, hare-lip, cleft palate, anomalies of the teeth and the\r\nhair, difficulties of speech, tic convulsif, abnormal and morbid states\r\nof the genital organs and genital functions, and more especially\r\nmalformations of the ear, such as Morel’s ear (the complete or partial\r\nabsence of the helix or antihelix), the Darwinian pointed ear, etc.[675]\r\n\r\nThe mental degenerative phenomena comprise all that are known as\r\n“bizarre or abnormal” characters; those who possess such characters are\r\ntermed “eccentrics” and “originals,” or are known as persons\r\n“psychopathically below par” (J. L. A. Koch), as “disequilibrated”\r\n(Eschle), as “superior degenerates” (Magnan). These phenomena comprise\r\npeculiar disturbances of the harmony of the spiritual life,\r\ncharacterized by lack of balance between emotion and intellect, as well\r\nas by an abnormal irritability and undue reaction to stimulation. We may\r\nfind complete absence of ethical perception, so-called “moral insanity,”\r\nof which E. Kraepelin and his school have proved that it may arise\r\nsecondarily as a sequel to certain mental disorders. Striking in these\r\nunbalanced persons is the disharmony of the entire conduct of life, the\r\ninternal lack of the _point d’appui_, the unsteadiness, the suddenness\r\nof their actions, which often occur under the influence of coercive\r\nideas and abnormal impulses, the abnormally early appearance and the\r\nextraordinary intensity of the sexual impulse, the tendency to cruelty\r\n(O. Rosenbach). In judging the personality of the degenerate as a whole,\r\nwe must always take into account the =entire course of life=, to which\r\nonly too often the remark of Stifter applies: “In his life we saw only\r\nbeginnings without continuations, and continuations without beginnings.”\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we must not forget that many of the bodily stigmata\r\nof degeneration occur also in healthy persons, and that the existence of\r\nsuch stigmata in mentally disordered persons and in criminals may also\r\nbe referred to social causes, to bad conditions of life and deficient\r\nnutriment, to alcoholism, syphilis, or rickets. For this reason P.\r\nNäcke[676] rightly insists =that many of the so-called stigmata of\r\ndegeneration are socially produced=, and will therefore disappear with\r\nthe employment of a purposive social hygiene; he gives as an example the\r\nrachitic bandy legs of English factory labourers. Therefore, for the\r\nproof of degeneration, we must lay more stress upon =mental= stigmata,\r\nupon abnormality of the spiritual personality, abnormality of its\r\nintellectual and emotional character, and from this proceed to infer the\r\nirresistible character of a morbid impulsive manifestation.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the study of the stigmata of degeneration, the study of\r\n=tattooing= is of forensic importance in the consideration of the sexual\r\noffences; the character and the date of the tattooing give sometimes\r\ninteresting information regarding the nature of the personality.\r\n\r\n  Thus Lombroso[677] reports the case of an offender against morality,\r\n  fifty years of age, with prominent ears and scanty growth of hair.\r\n  This man ravished a girl of fifteen, whose mother was his mistress.\r\n  =At the early age of fifteen= he had had the most obscene pictures\r\n  tattooed upon his body; and upon inquiry he stated that he had begun\r\n  to masturbate at the age of thirteen years, and had begun to have\r\n  intercourse with women at the age of fifteen years. He denied the\r\n  accusation of rape, and maintained that he had enjoyed the girl\r\n  without using force. =His tattooing, however, gave evidence= of his\r\n  capacity to commit sexual crime. The pictures served as a =certain and\r\n  important proof of this=.\r\n\r\n  This appeared even more clearly in the case of the ravisher Francesco\r\n  Spiteri, published by Dr. F. Santangelo in 1892, =whose utterly\r\n  immoral and sexually perverse mode of life was most wonderfully\r\n  displayed and recorded by means of the tattooings by which his entire\r\n  body was covered=. It will suffice here to allude to the drawing of a\r\n  fish and of seven points upon his membrum. This indicated that his\r\n  penis (Italian, _pesce_ = fish) since his youth had pædicated seven\r\n  boys (= seven points)!\r\n\r\nIn the case of sexual offences we have to consider, in addition to the\r\nquestion of degeneration, that of =diminished= or =entirely absent\r\nresponsibility=. In cases of unmistakable mental disorder,\r\nresponsibility does not exist, nor in epileptic confusional states, nor\r\nin profound alcoholic intoxication.[678] Between complete\r\nirresponsibility and complete responsibility there are numerous\r\ntransitional stages, which are all classified under the idea of\r\n=diminished responsibility=. This fact is not recognized by § 51 of the\r\nCriminal Code, which runs as follows:\r\n\r\n  “A punishable offence has not been committed when the accused at the\r\n  time the action was performed was in a state of unconsciousness, or in\r\n  a state or morbid disturbance of mental activity, by means of which\r\n  his freedom of will was excluded.”\r\n\r\nIn this we find the idea of “morbid disturbance of mental activity,”\r\nwhich is definitely wider than the idea of mental disease, in so far as\r\nit embraces transient mental disorders in persons who are not suffering\r\nfrom definite mental disease; but it does not take into consideration\r\nthe even more important notion of diminished responsibility, which is\r\napplicable to all the above described borderland states and transitional\r\nconditions lying between mental health and mental disease. Häussler\r\n(_op. cit._, p. 39) as long as eighty years ago demanded the recognition\r\nof the idea of diminished responsibility--that is, of a condition “in\r\nwhich responsibility for the action was =diminished= by an imperfectly\r\ndeveloped intelligence, without the disturbance of intellectual activity\r\nbeing sufficiently great completely to abolish free voluntary\r\ndetermination” (Aschaffenburg). Since that time, by the address given\r\non September 16, 1887, to the Association of German Alienists at\r\nFrankfort on “diminished responsibility,” Jolly opened a discussion upon\r\nthis question. In this discussion the majority of German psychiatrists\r\nrecommended the legislative recognition of such an idea, among these\r\nWollenberg, Hoche, Cramer, Kirn, Aschaffenburg, von Schrenck-Notzing,\r\netc.[679]\r\n\r\nIn connexion with diminished responsibility we must distinguish between\r\n=individuals= and =actions=. Among the individuals recognized above as\r\npersons “psychopathically below par,” responsibility may be diminished\r\npermanently and for a number of different actions; but in other cases\r\nhealthy normal individuals may exhibit diminished responsibility in\r\nrespect of =isolated actions=, when, for example, an =excessively strong\r\nemotion=, or a state of =acute intoxication=, has for a certain time and\r\nin relation to a particular action abrogated responsibility. In this\r\nconnexion, in addition to acute alcoholic intoxication, certain =sexual=\r\nprocesses have especially to be considered. Häussler recognized the\r\ninfluence of the sexual impulse upon responsibility, and considered that\r\ncertain actions performed under the influence of that impulse were\r\nperformed without complete responsibility, and he declared that the\r\nvoluptuary was a person whose mental health was imperfect.[680]\r\nForel[681] also regarded the “slaves of the sexual impulse” as mentally\r\nabnormal, as individuals whose responsibility was diminished. I consider\r\nit indisputable that sexual emotions, especially when they arise\r\nsuddenly, diminish responsibility, and limit, to some extent at least,\r\nthe freedom of voluntary determination. Regarding certain processes of\r\nthe _vita sexualis_, such as the epoch of =puberty= in both sexes,\r\nregarding =menstruation=, =pregnancy=, and the =climacteric in women=,\r\nthis fact has been already generally recognized. It ought, however, to\r\nbe admitted regarding the sexual impulse in general, more especially\r\nwhen the whole character of the action proves that it has been the\r\nconsequence of a suddenly arising powerful emotion. Von Krafft-Ebing\r\nalso is of this opinion.[682] It is, moreover, in most cases possible to\r\ndetermine whether the offence was caused =only by a powerful sexual\r\nemotion=, by means of which the intelligence and the freedom of the will\r\nof a person, in other respects normally responsible, were temporarily\r\nlimited or completely arrested; or whether other motives intervened, so\r\nthat the action must be regarded as the result of conscious choice.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, another point must be considered, which is related to the\r\nquestion of sexual offences committed with children, and which possesses\r\nforensic importance. This is the circumstance that in many such cases\r\nthere is no question of the “seduction” of children, but that, on the\r\ncontrary, the incitation =first= proceeded from the children themselves.\r\nIn the previous chapter we discussed the early appearance of sexual\r\nactivity in children. Moreover, in such cases we could distinguish\r\nbetween a nobler and a grosser, more sensual love.\r\n\r\n  As an example of the former, I may allude to the ardent, affectionate\r\n  love of a girl of twelve for a thoroughly honourable man of forty\r\n  years of age, who certainly had no idea of sexual intimacy with the\r\n  child, and who was unable to free himself from her passionate\r\n  caresses. We often observe such intimate inclinations on the part of\r\n  young girls towards mature men, and we must be careful in such cases\r\n  to avoid immediately thinking of pædophilic unchastity.\r\n\r\n  In another case a mother complained that her daughter, seven years of\r\n  age, was in continual pursuit of a boy of fourteen, and could not be\r\n  cured of the affection.\r\n\r\n  Maria Lischnewska reports (“Mutterschutz,” 1905, p. 155) the case of a\r\n  boy, not yet six years of age, who drew up the nightgown of his\r\n  foster-mother, and endeavoured to have intercourse with her.\r\n\r\nThe sexual offences committed by clergymen and tutors upon the girls\r\ntaught by them are apt to be seen in a different light when we subject\r\nthe youthful accuser to a strict cross-examination, and, in addition, to\r\na physical examination, whereby in many cases we bring to light the fact\r\nthat, long =before= the recent offence, they have been accustomed =of\r\ntheir own free will= to have sexual relations with =other= men. Casper\r\nlong ago drew attention to these circumstances. Very often =from the\r\npupil herself proceed actual advances= of the worst kind, which have\r\nproved ruinous to many a young teacher whose morals were previously\r\nabove reproach.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is an important point which must not be forgotten: the\r\nuntrustworthy character of childish evidence, a matter which has\r\nrecently been discussed by the specialist Adolf Baginsky.[683] This\r\nwriter, whose knowledge of childish psychology is so profound, remarks:\r\n\r\n\r\n  “The evidence given by children in the law-courts appears to those who\r\n  are really familiar with the child mind to be =absolutely worthless=\r\n  and =utterly devoid of importance=, and this is the more the case the\r\n  more frequently the child repeats its statement, and the more firmly\r\n  it sticks to its evidence.”\r\n\r\nHe alludes to the law of Sweden, according to which the child is not\r\ncompetent to give evidence in a law-court before the completion of its\r\nfifteenth year.\r\n\r\nAll these circumstances must be considered in relation to the question\r\nof the so-called “=age of consent=.” M. Hirschfeld justly remarks that\r\nthe natural age of consent is equivalent to that at which a child is\r\ncompetent to make a choice (“The Nature of Love,” p. 284). I consider\r\nthat the decision of the Italian Criminal Code is the best; by this Code\r\nthe age of consent for =both= sexes is placed at the conclusion of the\r\nsixteenth year.\r\n\r\nThe majority of crimes committed from purely sexual motives belong to\r\nthe crimes of passion, in the sense of Ferris, and indeed to crimes\r\ncommitted under the coercion of the most powerful of organic impulses. I\r\ndoubt whether the existing punishments are the most suitable for the\r\npurpose for which they are designed. In any case, gentleness is here\r\nabove all demanded, and we should invoke the saying, “Judge not, that ye\r\nbe not judged!” Indeed, an evangelical minister[684] speaks truly when\r\nhe says:\r\n\r\n  “=The enormous majority of men and women, who constitute themselves\r\n  the judges of offences against morality, whilst they themselves take\r\n  every opportunity of infringing the moral laws they profess to\r\n  uphold--lie day after day, throughout their whole life--their position\r\n  is built upon hypocrisy and lies.=”\r\n\r\nIt very rarely happens that a judge who condemns a thief or a murderer\r\nhas himself been guilty of this crime, but without doubt it frequently\r\nhappens that a judge condemns other men on account of sexual offences\r\nwhich he has himself committed. In the case of =sexual crimes= we almost\r\nalways have to do with individuals to whom more good could be done by\r\n=medical influence= than by imprisonment; we must entrust the physician\r\nwith the duty of protecting society against such offenders. “=In this\r\nprovince, physicians will become the judges of the future=,” says M.\r\nHirschfeld most justly.[685] Until this end is attained, let us remind\r\nGerman judges of an anecdote which I found in an old French\r\nencyclopædia:[686]\r\n\r\n  “A courtesan in Madrid killed her lover, on account of his\r\n  unfaithfulness; she was condemned and brought before the king, from\r\n  whom she hid nothing. The king said to her: ‘Thou hast loved =too\r\n  much= to be a reasonable being.’”\r\n\r\n  [673] E.

Schreiber, in a paper\r\nentitled “Sexual Abstinence,” published in _Medizinische Blätter_, 1907,\r\nNos. 25-27.]\r\n\r\nI distinguish =five= groups of opinion:\r\n\r\n1. The apostles of =absolute asceticism= during the whole of life\r\n(Tolstoi, Weininger, Norbert Grabowsky, Kurnig, etc.).\r\n\r\n2. The _medical_ advocates of =relative temporary continence=, until it\r\nbecomes possible to enjoy permanent hygienic intercourse, free from all\r\nobjections.\r\n\r\n3. The advocates of “=duplex sexual morality=,” who demand from _woman_\r\nsexual abstinence until she marries, but who regard this as impossible\r\nin the case of _man_.\r\n\r\n4. The “=Vera=”[687] =enthusiasts=, who on =moral= grounds demand\r\nabstinence for =both= sexes until marriage.\r\n\r\n5. Those who =doubt= the possibility of abstinence of =any= kind for\r\neither sex, whether absolute =or= relative.\r\n\r\nRegarding those mentioned under the first heading, who demand absolute,\r\nlife-long sexual abstinence, it is hardly necessary to say a word. It is\r\nnonsense, a pious superstition, a Utopia contrary alike to nature and to\r\ncivilization, born of the belief in the “sinfulness” of sexual\r\nintercourse.\r\n\r\nThe normal sexual impulse is a =natural= phenomenon; it is pure and\r\nthoroughly ethical; and it is only in an insane confusion and in a\r\nmorally reprehensible falsification of his own nature that man has come\r\nto regard it as a “sin,” as an “evil.” Man has a natural, inborn right\r\nto the gratification of the sexual impulse. Absolute asceticism must be\r\nrejected as a thoroughly =immoral= doctrine.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of the duplex sexual morality, alluded to under the\r\nthird heading, by which that is justified to man which is denied to\r\nwoman. This “=morality=” (_lucus a non lucendo_) presupposes for man a\r\nnatural impulse, and demands for him a right to gratify it, whilst the\r\nexistence of such an impulse and of such a right is denied to woman. We\r\nhave shown that this view is an inevitable consequence of coercive\r\nmarriage morality.[688]\r\n\r\nThe standpoint of the sceptics alluded to under § 5 is one which denies\r\nthe possibility of =any= abstinence, even merely temporary abstinence;\r\nbut this view is equally to be rejected. Man is a natural being; his\r\nsexual impulse is a natural instinct, and as such one whose existence is\r\njustified; but at the same time man is a =civilized being=. Civilization\r\nis an elevation, an ennoblement, a transfiguration of nature, whose\r\nunduly powerful impulses and powers must be tamed and harmonized by\r\ncivilization. The right to sexual gratification is therefore opposed by\r\nthe =duty= to set bounds to the sexual impulse, to conduct it into such\r\npaths that no harm can result from its exercise, either to the\r\nindividual or to society; and in order that, like all other impulses, it\r\nmay subserve the purposes of the evolution of civilization. To this end,\r\nhowever, a =relative abstinence= is of great importance (this is a\r\nmatter which has not hitherto been sufficiently recognized); but this\r\ncourse it is only possible to follow when, at the same time, we\r\nemphatically =affirm the rightness of sexuality=, and when it is our\r\ndesire to utilize it as a =civilizing factor of the first rank=. The\r\n“individualization” of the sexual impulse has been described in detail\r\nin an earlier chapter of this work, to which I may refer the reader. If\r\nwe fail to recognize the value of =temporary abstinence=, and the\r\nimportance of the storing up of sexual energy which is thereby effected,\r\nand the transformation of this energy into other energies of a spiritual\r\nnature, such an individualization becomes impossible.\r\n\r\nAlike the medical advocates (§ 2) and the moral advocates (§ 4) of a\r\nrelative temporary abstinence for both sexes have, from their respective\r\nstandpoints, made a just demand. This is, in fact, in both cases an\r\n“ideal standpoint,” to use the phrase of F. A. Lange; but it is also an\r\nideal most desirable to set before youth, and more especially before our\r\nGerman youth. We cannot repeat too often, or insist with too much\r\nemphasis, what an endless blessing results from the endeavour towards,\r\nand from the realization of, temporary sexual abstinence, more\r\nespecially in the years of =preparation= for life, but also in the years\r\nof =independent creative work=.\r\n\r\nThe importance of =relative= sexual abstinence was first recognized by\r\nthe ancient Israelites. Numerous wise prescriptions and utterances prove\r\nthis. Julius Preuss, the most celebrated student of ancient Jewish\r\nmedicine, has recently, in an interesting study of “Sexual Matters in\r\nthe Bible and the Talmud” (_Allgemeine Medizinische Central-Zeitung_,\r\n1906, No. 30 _et seq._), collected the following facts bearing on the\r\nmatter:\r\n\r\n  “Chastity was a self-evident demand for the unmarried. It is true\r\n  that, in view of the early occurrence of puberty, they married very\r\n  young--at the age of eighteen or twenty; and Rabbi Huna is of opinion\r\n  that anyone who at the age of twenty is still unmarried passes his\r\n  days in sin or--which he regards as even worse--in sinful thoughts.\r\n  There are three whom God praises every day: an unmarried man who lives\r\n  in a large town and does not sin; a poor man who finds an object of\r\n  value and returns it to the owner, and a rich man who gives his tithe\r\n  secretly. Once when this doctrine was read out in the presence of\r\n  Rabbi Safra, who as a young man lived in a large town, his face\r\n  lighted up with joy. But Raba said to him: ‘It is not meant such a one\r\n  as thou art, but such a one as Rabbi Chanina and Rabbi Oschaja, who\r\n  live in the street of the prostitutes, and make shoes for them, to\r\n  whom, therefore, the prostitutes come, and look upon them, but who,\r\n  notwithstanding this, do not raise their eyes to look upon the\r\n  prostitutes.’”\r\n\r\nAfter marriage also they endeavoured by valuable prescriptions to\r\nenforce the great civilizing idea of temporary sexual abstinence. Thus,\r\nintercourse during menstruation was strictly forbidden, and was regarded\r\nas a deadly sin; the same was the case as regards intercourse when there\r\nwas any other hæmorrhage from the genital organs; but in this case the\r\nabstinence must last even longer. It is remarkable that the Catholic\r\ntheologians allowed sexual intercourse without limit when such morbid\r\nhæmorrhage was present, and allowed it also, with certain restrictions,\r\nduring menstruation. Further, among the ancient Hebrews intercourse was\r\nforbidden during the week of mourning for parents or brothers or\r\nsisters; it was forbidden also during the festival of atonement. Guests\r\nin an inn when travelling were also forbidden sexual intercourse,\r\ndoubtless on grounds of decency. Intercourse was likewise forbidden in\r\ntimes of famine, in order to spare the bodily forces.\r\n\r\nGolden sayings recognize the value of moderation and of relative\r\nabstinence.\r\n\r\n  According to an ancient Israelitish popular saying, sexual intercourse\r\n  is one of eight things =which are beautiful when enjoyed in strict\r\n  moderation, but harmful when enjoyed very freely=. The others are\r\n  walking, possessions, work, wine, sleep, warm water (for bathing and\r\n  for drinking), and venesection.\r\n\r\n  Rabbi Jochanan said: “Man possesses a little limb: he who satisfies it\r\n  hungers; he who allows it to hunger is satisfied.”\r\n\r\n  Rabbi Ilai said: “When man observes that his evil impulse is more\r\n  powerful than he is himself, let him go to a place where people do not\r\n  know him, let him put on dark clothes, let him wear a dark turban, and\r\n  let him do that which his heart desires; but let him not publicly\r\n  profane the name of God.” This can only mean that in general he only\r\n  controls the desire who has already tasted the fruit--that is to say,\r\n  that abstinence is the safest means against lust; but he who,\r\n  notwithstanding this, finds that the impulse threatens to become too\r\n  violent, still has the duty to fight against it, and in any case not\r\n  to yield immediately.\r\n\r\nThis ancient notion of relative asceticism was, unfortunately, falsified\r\nand thrust into the background by the Utopian and contra-natural idea of\r\nabsolute asceticism; its great value was completely obscured by the\r\ninevitable reaction against the principle of absolute chastity. This\r\nreaction led actually to the formation of rules regarding the frequency\r\nof intercourse, such as that attributed to Luther--“Twice a week does\r\nharm neither to her nor to me”; =although it is precisely in this\r\ndepartment of life that no rules can be given, and that the greatest\r\nindividual variations occur=, so that “twice a week” may for many\r\nconstitute by far too much, and can only be regarded as permissible to\r\nrobust constitutions. =Daily= indulgence in sexual intercourse,\r\ncontinued for a =long period= of time, would be deleterious even to a\r\nHercules, =and in all circumstances would be harmful to both parties=.\r\nNature herself, by exhibiting a certain periodicity in sexual excitement\r\n(which periodicity is admittedly far more distinct in women than it is\r\nin men, who can “always” love), has facilitated temporary abstinence.\r\nThis is, in fact, a natural demand even of the most extreme ethical\r\nmaterialism; for, as Friedrich Albert Lange[689] rightly points out,\r\n“even though the individual sensual pleasure, as with Aristippos or\r\nLamettrie, is raised to a principle, =self-control= still remains a\r\nrequirement of philosophy, if only in order to assure the permanence of\r\nthe capacity for enjoyment.” So also the poet of the “New Tanhäuser”\r\nsings:\r\n\r\n   “Selig, der da ewig schmachtet,\r\n    Sei gepriesen, Tantalus,\r\n    Hätt’ er je, wonach er trachtet,\r\n    Würd’ es auch schon Ueberdruss:\r\n    Gib mir immer =Eine= Beere,\r\n    Aus der vollen Traube nur,\r\n    Und ich schmachte gern, Cythere,\r\n    Lebenslang auf deiner Spur!”\r\n\r\n  [“Happy is he who eternally desires.\r\n    A happy man art thou, Tantalus!\r\n    If he ever attained that for which he longs,\r\n    He would instantly taste satiety:\r\n    Let me have but a =single= grape\r\n    From the full cluster,\r\n    Gladly, Cytherea, will I live,\r\n    Ever desiring, in thy courts!”]\r\n\r\nThe question of abstinence is an entirely different one, according as it\r\nrelates to the time =before= or =after= the first experience of sexual\r\nintercourse. Experience shows that in the former case abstinence is far\r\neasier than it is when the forbidden fruit has once been tasted. If,\r\nwith the author of this book, relative asceticism is regarded as the\r\nmost desirable ideal, we shall endeavour in =youth= to realize that\r\nideal for as long a time as possible, =without= any interruption by\r\nsexual intercourse; whereas in the later period of the fully-developed\r\nsexual life we shall practise sexual abstinence only from time to time.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the former point, it would be the greatest good fortune\r\nfor every man if he could remain sexually abstinent until the complete\r\nmaturity of body and mind--that is, until the age of twenty-five.[690]\r\nBut this is in most cases an impossibility. Yet it =is possible= for\r\n=every= healthy man--and it is an imperative demand of individual and\r\nsocial hygiene--=to abstain completely from sexual intercourse at least\r\nuntil the age of twenty=. That is possible without any harm resulting,\r\nand it is carried out by innumerable persons of both sexes. It is,\r\nindeed, a fact that in civilized countries the physical and mental\r\nmaturity of girls and boys by no means coincides with their sexual\r\nmaturity, but, on the contrary, occurs from three to five years later.\r\nFirst between the ages of twenty and twenty-two does man attain complete\r\ndevelopment.[691] If the sexual impulse is not artificially awakened and\r\nstimulated during these years of adolescence, it may remain very\r\nmoderate, without masturbation and without pollutions, and can be easily\r\ncontrolled. Relations with the other sex have not yet become necessary\r\nfor the development of the individual personality. The human being has\r\nstill enough to do in isolation. First with the commencement of the\r\nthird decade of life do the conditions alter, and sexual tension becomes\r\nso great as to demand the adequate and natural discharge given by the\r\nnormal sexual act. If this is impossible, pollutions form the natural,\r\nor masturbation forms the unnatural, outlet; and when abstinence is\r\ncontinued for a long time after attaining this age, the vital freshness\r\nand the spiritual and emotional condition are more or less impaired. To\r\nhave emphasized this fact, in opposition to those authors[692] who\r\ndeclared that total sexual abstinence is absolutely harmless to mature\r\nmen, was the great service of Wilhelm Erb,[693] the celebrated, widely\r\nexperienced Heidelberg neurologist.\r\n\r\n  “It is a well-known fact,” he writes, “that healthy young men with a\r\n  powerful sexual impulse suffer not a little from abstinence, that from\r\n  time to time they are ‘as if possessed’ by the impulse, that erotic\r\n  ideas press in upon them from all sides, disturb their work and their\r\n  nocturnal repose, and imperiously demand relief. I always remember the\r\n  remark of a friend of my youth, a young artist, who, when speaking of\r\n  these things, was accustomed to say with intense meaning: ‘Wer nie die\r\n  kummervollen Nächte in seinem Bette weinend sass....’ And the same man\r\n  could not sufficiently extol the relaxing, disburdening, and\r\n  positively refreshing influence of an occasional gratification; and\r\n  the same thing has been said to me innumerable times by earnest and\r\n  thoroughly moderate men.”\r\n\r\nWomen also gave him similar assurances.[694] In numerous cases Erb\r\nobserved physical and mental harm to result from abstinence--sometimes\r\nin healthy individuals, but more especially in the neuropathic.\r\n\r\nImportant also are the investigations of L. Löwenfeld[695] regarding the\r\ninfluence of abstinence. He found that in men under the age of\r\ntwenty-four any troubles worth mentioning as a result of sexual\r\nabstinence were comparatively rare, as compared with the case of men\r\nbetween the ages of twenty-four and thirty-six years, the years of\r\ncomplete manly power and sexual capacity; and he found that whereas in\r\nhealthy persons these disturbances were indeed of a trifling character\r\n(general excitability, sexual hyperæsthesia, hypochondriacal ideas,\r\ndisinclination for work, slight attacks of giddiness), in neuropathic\r\npersons, on the contrary, there would occur coercive ideas, melancholy,\r\nfeelings of anxiety, and even hallucinations. Females, according to\r\nLöwenfeld, bear abstinence--even absolute abstinence--much better than\r\nmen, but in them also hysterical and neurasthenic conditions may develop\r\nas a result of sexual abstinence.\r\n\r\nAll these harmful consequences of abstinence are, however, neither in\r\nman nor in woman, of such a nature that, where an opportunity for sexual\r\nintercourse at once hygienic and free from ethical objections is\r\nwanting, the gratification of the sexual impulse need be advised by the\r\nphysician as a “therapeutic measure.” No; Erb himself insists that, on\r\nthe contrary, the dangers threatened by venereal diseases =altogether\r\noutweigh= the comparatively rare and trifling injuries to health\r\nresulting from abstinence. “Extra-conjugal” sexual intercourse involves\r\nthe dangers of syphilitic or gonorrhœal infection, or of illegitimate\r\npregnancy, which latter to-day must, unfortunately, be regarded as a\r\nkind of severe disease. In contrast with these evils, any harmful\r\nconsequences of abstinence fade away to nothing.\r\n\r\nLater in life, when the possibility of a permanent pure love exists, the\r\nvalue of temporary abstinence is to be found especially in the spiritual\r\nsphere. Precisely for the “erotocrat,” as Georg Hirth terms one endowed\r\nwith a powerful and healthy sexual impulse, is this temporary abstinence\r\nof a certain importance, because the stored-up quantum of sexual tension\r\nre-enforces the inward spiritual productivity. A number of men, at once\r\nendowed with strong sexual needs and with a noble mental capacity, have\r\nassured me that, in consequence of abstinence, they have temporarily\r\nexperienced a peculiar deepening and concentration of their mental\r\ncapacity, by means of which they were undeniably enabled to increase\r\ntheir mental output. This point in the hygiene of intellectual activity,\r\nwhich seems not to have been unknown to Goethe, has been as yet too\r\nlittle studied.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it is definitely established that from the standpoint of\r\ncivilization the idea of sexual abstinence is justified, if for this\r\nreason alone: because in it we find a great means for increasing and\r\nstrengthening of the =will=; but, in the second place, because in it we\r\nhave a valuable protection against the dangers of wild love; and,\r\nfinally, because sexual abstinence emphasizes the fact that life\r\ncontains other things worth striving for besides matters of sex, that\r\nthe content of life is far from being exhausted by the sexual, even\r\nthough the sexual impulse, in addition to the impulse of\r\nself-preservation, will always remain the most powerful of all vital\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\n  [687] “Vera” is the heroine of a novel (“Eine für Viele: Aus dem\r\n  Tagebuche eines Mädchens”) which attracted considerable attention in\r\n  Germany. She demanded from men entering on marriage the same virgin\r\n  intactitude which men are accustomed to expect in their wives. English\r\n  readers will be reminded of Evadne, in Sarah Grand’s “The Heavenly\r\n  Twins.” Evadne, it will be remembered, left her husband at the church\r\n  door, owing to information she received regarding his preconjugal\r\n  career. In England we might speak of “Evadne” enthusiasts, instead of\r\n  “Vera” enthusiasts.--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n  [688] P. Näcke also (“A Contribution to the Woman’s Question and to\r\n  the Question of Sexual Abstinence,” _op. cit._, p. 49) strongly\r\n  condemns this duplex morality, which he regards as “obviously unjust.”\r\n  _Cf._ also Max Thal, “Sexual Morality: an Attempt to solve the Problem\r\n  of Sexual, and more Particularly of the so-called Duplex Morality”\r\n  (Breslau, 1904).\r\n\r\n  [689] Friedrich Albert Lange, “History of Materialism,” vol. iii., p.\r\n  302, English edition.\r\n\r\n  [690] “My dear young men,” thus wrote Ernst Moritz Arndt, at the age\r\n  of eighty-nine, to the Burschenschaft (Students’ Association) of Jena,\r\n  “I can wish nothing better for you than that you should arrange your\r\n  course of life in Jena, and pass through it, as I heretofore passed\r\n  through it, making a courageous, vigorous, and earnest fight against\r\n  the lusty, overbearing impulses of youth, which in the best case are\r\n  so easily carried to excess.... In these your most valuable years,\r\n  between eighteen and twenty, you must, with redoubled manliness,\r\n  courage, and chastity, strive to deserve the praise given by Caius\r\n  Julius Cæsar to the young men of Germany.”\r\n\r\n  [691] _Cf._, in this connexion, the remarks of A. Herzen, “Science and\r\n  Morality,” pp. 11, 12 (Berlin, 1901). The same age for human maturity\r\n  was fixed on also by J. C. G. Ackermann (“The Diseases of the\r\n  Learned,” p. 268; Nürnberg, 1777).\r\n\r\n  [692] I need mention only Seved Ribbing, Acton, Rubner, Paget, Hegar,\r\n  Beale, Herzen, A. Eulenburg, V.

Until recently people went so far as to\r\nregard scientific research into sexual matters by =adult persons= as\r\nimproper! The mystical idea of the sinfulness, of the radically evil\r\ncharacter, of the sexual, was a dogma which even natural science\r\nappeared to admit. Our attitude towards the sexual was as if it were at\r\nonce Sphinx and Gorgon’s head, as if it were the veiled statue of Sais.\r\nWe stood helpless, in the face of this mysterious and malignant power,\r\nagainst the =blind hazard of chance which plays= so momentous a part,\r\nmore especially in sexual affairs. As everywhere in life, so here also,\r\nthe dominion of chance could be overcome only by means of knowledge. The\r\nsolution of the sexual problem demands, in the first place, =openness=,\r\n=clearness=, =learning= in the department of the sexual, knowledge of\r\ncause and effect, and the =transmission= of this knowledge to the =next\r\ngeneration=, so that this latter may without harm become wise. =Sexual\r\neducation= is an important chapter in general pedagogy.[696]\r\n\r\nRegarding animals, plants, and stones the youthful human being of to-day\r\nacquires the most exact information, but we have hitherto =refused= him\r\nthe right to understand his own body, and to acquire a knowledge of\r\ncertain important vital functions of that body. There can be no doubt\r\nabout the fact that the modern human being, who has learned to so large\r\nan extent to regard himself as a =social= being, has a sacred natural\r\nright to this knowledge.\r\n\r\nCelebrated pedagogues of a hundred years ago, such as Rousseau,\r\nSalzmann, Basedow, Jean Paul, etc., expressed themselves in favour of\r\nthe early sexual enlightenment of youth, and gave the most valuable\r\nadvice regarding the methods to be employed;[697] but their views\r\nremained for the most part devoid of practical effect, and it is only in\r\nrecent years, in connexion with the question of the protection of\r\nmotherhood, with the campaign against prostitution, and with the attempt\r\nto suppress venereal diseases, that interest in this matter has been\r\nreawakened; and there now exists in this department an extensive\r\nliterature, belonging chiefly to the last few years, proceeding from the\r\npens of physicians, pedagogues, hygienists, and advocates of woman’s\r\nrights.[698] It is, in truth, the burning question of our time, the\r\nsolution of which is here attempted. Correct sexual education forms the\r\nfoundation for the ennoblement and resanation of our entire sexual life.\r\nOnly =knowledge= and =will= can here effect a cure. Thus, sexual\r\npedagogy naturally falls into two parts--=sexual enlightenment= and the\r\n=education of the will=.\r\n\r\nThe need for sexual enlightenment is now recognized by all far-seeing\r\nsocial hygienists and pedagogues. The only difference of opinion\r\nconcerns the =when= and the =how=. Some plead for enlightenment as early\r\nas possible, in the first years of school life; others wish to defer\r\nenlightenment until puberty, or even later. I am of opinion that the\r\ncircumstances in this respect are entirely different, according as we\r\nhave to do with small towns and the open country, where more careful\r\nwatching of children is possible, and where the dangers of premature\r\nsexual development and of seduction are not so great, or as we have to\r\ndo with large towns, where, in my view, the children =cannot be\r\nenlightened too early=, since town life brings the children of all\r\nclasses, and social misery brings more especially the children of the\r\nlowest classes of the population, so early into contact with sexual\r\nmatters that a purposive enlightenment becomes absolutely indispensable.\r\nChildren living in large towns should, from ten years onwards, be\r\ngradually and carefully made acquainted with the principal facts of the\r\nsexual life. We find here =more points of association= than is usually\r\nimagined. Gutzkow, in his admirable autobiography, “From the Days of My\r\nBoyhood” (Frankfort-a.-M., 1852, pp. 263, 264), has beautifully\r\ndescribed this:\r\n\r\n  “The first appearances of love in the heart of the child occur as\r\n  secretly as the fall of the dew upon flowers. Playing and jesting,\r\n  innocence gropes its way through the darkness. Words, perceptions,\r\n  ideas, which to the adult appear to be full of dangerous barbs, the\r\n  child grasps with careless security, and takes the duplex sexual life\r\n  of humanity to be a primeval fact which came into the world with man\r\n  as a matter of course, and one which requires no explanation. Born\r\n  from the mother’s womb, to the child the mother is the secure bridge\r\n  by which it is conducted past all the riddles of womanhood. The child\r\n  imitates the love of the father for the mother, plays the game of the\r\n  family, plays father and mother, plays at being himself, a child. From\r\n  the rustling autumn leaves, from abandoned bundles of straw, huts and\r\n  nests are built, and for half an hour at a time a completely blameless\r\n  boy can lie down besides his girl playmate, quietly, and as if\r\n  magnetized by the intimation of love. Danger is in truth not far\r\n  distant from such a practice of childish naïveté; it lurks in the\r\n  background, and seeks only an opportunity to lead astray. But a child\r\n  never understands the significance of the severe punishment which it\r\n  so often receives for its imitative imaginary family life. The amatory\r\n  life of the adult first breaks upon the imagination of the child and\r\n  upon his quiet play like the opening of a door into a house. People\r\n  take so little care of what they do before the innocent; they exhibit\r\n  passionate affection for one another; they caress when the children\r\n  are by. The child sees, ponders, and listens. Certain hieroglyphics\r\n  alarm it; tales are laughed at--tales which suddenly throw a strange\r\n  and wonderful light upon quite familiar human beings. The boy will\r\n  notice that his elder sister has a joy or a sorrow, the nature of\r\n  which he cannot completely grasp. He sees an elder brother filled with\r\n  the joy of life, with the lust of youth, with the love of adventure,\r\n  and no attempt is made to conceal these passions from the child....\r\n  Such and similar experiences succeed one another without cessation,\r\n  and tales which the child hears are listened to with eagerness. The\r\n  red threads of love and of the charm of beautiful women are not to be\r\n  grasped by the hand of a child, and yet they have upon the child a\r\n  certain secret influence.”\r\n\r\nThe child hears and sees much that is erotic, even immoral, but does not\r\nstop to think about it, does not understand it. After a while its\r\nignorance becomes a puzzle; soon lascivious thoughts arise. Maria\r\nLischnewska describes very vividly this psychological process in the\r\nsoul of the child, in part according to her observations as a teacher.\r\nShe justly criticizes the “stork stories,” to which the child listens\r\nwithout believing them, in order subsequently to be enlightened in an\r\nextremely disagreeable manner by older ill-conditioned comrades.[699]\r\n\r\nThese children, ten or twelve years of age, often learn about sexual\r\nmatters from the lowest side, =without= obtaining a =true knowledge=.\r\nThey frequently acquire the most astounding verbal treasury of lewd\r\nexpressions, and even sing obscene songs, of which Maria Lischnewska\r\ngives a remarkable example on the part of a girl twelve years of age.\r\n\r\nNo, there can be no question that the child at school, from the tenth\r\nyear onwards, should, without fear of disastrous consequences, be\r\nenlightened regarding sexual matters by parents and teachers, in order\r\nto avoid the dangers which we have just described. But this instruction\r\nmust be divested of any individual relationship, of any personal\r\ncharacter, and must be communicated in thoroughly general terms, as\r\n=natural scientific knowledge=, as a medical doctrine, belonging to the\r\nprovince of philosophical and pathological science. In this way will be\r\navoided any undesirable accessory effect related to subjective\r\nperceptions. When Matthisson esteems youth as happy on this account,\r\nbecause the =book of possibilities= is not yet open to its gaze, this\r\ncertainly does =not= hold as regards sexual enlightenment. Here, to a\r\ncertain degree, this book of possibilities must be disclosed, if we do\r\nnot wish all the poetry and all the ideal view of life to be utterly\r\ndestroyed by contact with rude reality. Precisely in this case do we\r\nunderstand the wonderful remark of Goethe, that we receive the veil of\r\npoetry from the hand of =truth=. This first renders possible a truly\r\nearnest and profound conception of sexual relationships; this creates a\r\nconsciousness of responsibility which cannot be awakened sufficiently\r\nearly. The true danger is, as Freud[700] also points out, the\r\nintermixture of “lasciviousness and prudery” with which humanity is\r\naccustomed to regard the sexual problem, just because people have not\r\nlearned sufficiently to understand the connexion between cause and\r\neffect in this department of human activity.\r\n\r\nVarious methods have been recommended for sexual enlightenment. I shall\r\ndiscuss more particularly the suggestions of the Austrian _Realschul_\r\nprofessor, Sigmund, of the _Volkschul_ teacher, Maria Lischnewska, and\r\nof the University professor, F. W. Förster.\r\n\r\nSigmund (quoted by Ullmann, _op. cit._, p. 7) considers that in the\r\n_Volkschüler_ (primary schools), in the case of children up to the age\r\nof eleven years, there should be no systematic explanation of sexual\r\nmatters, and that this should be begun first in the Gymnasium (higher\r\nschool). His scheme of instruction is as follows:\r\n\r\n  1. The enlightenment of the pupils at the Gymnasium is to be effected\r\n  in five stages (Classes I., II., V., VI., VII.)\r\n\r\n  2. The enlightenment in the lower classes is limited to the processes\r\n  of sexual reproduction. In the first class, the origin and birth of\r\n  the mammalian young and the origin of insects’ eggs are explained. In\r\n  the second class, the origin and birth of reptiles’ and birds’ eggs,\r\n  the fertilization of the eggs of fishes and batrachians, the ova of\r\n  the sea-urchin, and those of the jellyfish, are described. =The act of\r\n  sexual intercourse will not be alluded to in the first two\r\n  classes--that is, it will not be mentioned to children before the age\r\n  of thirteen years.=\r\n\r\n  3. The completion of the idea of “sexual life” is effected by means of\r\n  botanical and zoological instruction in the upper school in a\r\n  synthetic manner, wherein no important detail is omitted, but the\r\n  copulatory act is kept in the background.\r\n\r\n  4. All sexual matters expressly concerning human beings, and all the\r\n  pathological relations of the sexual life, should be left to the\r\n  hygienic instruction, which is given during one hour weekly to the\r\n  seventh class as a part of general instruction in somatology.\r\n\r\n  5. The natural history taught to the sixth class will embrace zoology\r\n  only; the natural system will be considered in an ascending series\r\n  (excluding human somatology, which in a logical manner is deferred\r\n  until the study of zoology is completed, and it will thus be dealt\r\n  with in the seventh class, as a preparation to the instruction in\r\n  hygiene).\r\n\r\n  6. In conferences with parents, the parents can be kept informed\r\n  regarding the nature of the instruction which is being given to their\r\n  children, and can at the same time be led to work in unison with the\r\n  school in this matter.\r\n\r\nMaria Lischnewska advises beginning already in the third class of\r\nprimary schools--that is, when the child is only eight years old--to\r\ngive instruction in the elements of natural science, more especially\r\nutilizing, as the first means of sexual enlightenment, the examples of\r\nvegetable fertilization, as well as the reproduction of fishes and\r\nbirds. Even to the question “Whence do little children come?” an answer\r\nshould be given, more or less in the following terms:\r\n\r\n  “The child lies in the body of the mother: when she breathes, then the\r\n  child breathes; when she eats and drinks, the child also obtains his\r\n  food. It lies there warm and safe. Gradually it becomes larger and\r\n  begins to move. It has to lie somewhat curled up, because there is so\r\n  little room for it. But the mother feels that it is alive; she is full\r\n  of joy, and makes ready the child’s clothing and its bed. Finally it\r\n  is fully grown. The mother’s body opens, and the child comes to the\r\n  light. Then the mother takes it into her arms with joy and nourishes\r\n  it with her milk.” Then the teacher would pause, and continue after a\r\n  while: “Now, would you like to see the child?” Then there would\r\n  naturally be a many-voiced “Yes, yes!” and the teacher would show to\r\n  the class a picture such as our anatomical atlases exhibit now in\r\n  beautiful form. The abdominal walls of the mother are turned back, and\r\n  the child is seen slumbering. Then the teacher would say: “Thus you\r\n  also slept within the body of your mother. You belong to her as to no\r\n  other human being in the whole world. For this reason you should\r\n  always love and honour her.”\r\n\r\n  Thus is the child’s urgent demand for knowledge satisfied. He is freed\r\n  from all prying into nooks and corners. He experiences a feeling of\r\n  honourable respect towards the primary source of life.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth school year further examples of the reproduction of\r\nplants, fishes, and birds should be given; in the fifth and sixth years\r\nthe first demonstration of the process of sexual union among the\r\nmammals, with some account of embryology; and the process of birth\r\nshould also be described. Then there should follow (at about the age of\r\nthirteen or fourteen) enlightenment regarding the development of the\r\nsexual life and regarding venereal diseases--information, that is to\r\nsay, concerning hygiene and concerning the protection of one’s own body.\r\nPhysicians such as Oker Blom and Dr. Agnes Hacker definitely demand that\r\nelucidation regarding this latter point should =not= be deferred until\r\nthe time of puberty.\r\n\r\nF. W. Förster proposes to postpone the whole process of enlightenment\r\n=until the twelfth or thirteenth year=; and if at an earlier age a child\r\nexpresses any natural doubt regarding the stork fables, the following\r\nanswer should be given (_op. cit._, p. 606):\r\n\r\n  “Where small children come from is a matter which you cannot yet\r\n  understand. We grown-up persons even understand very little about it.\r\n  I promise you that I will explain to you what we know of the matter on\r\n  your twelfth birthday, but only if you promise me something in return.\r\n  Do you know that there are boys and girls so bumptious that they\r\n  behave as if they already knew all about it, because they have\r\n  somewhere picked up a word or two without really understanding it?\r\n  Promise me that you will never listen when such as these begin to talk\r\n  about the matter; for you may be certain that the true secrets are\r\n  matters of which they are ignorant, for this reason--they would not\r\n  speak about it. He who really knows holds it as a sacred matter; he is\r\n  silent about it, and does not call it out at the street comers.”\r\n\r\nFörster strongly advises =against= associating sexual enlightenment with\r\na knowledge of the reproductive process in plants and animals, for this\r\nreason: that if this is done “the human being is brought too near to the\r\nvegetable and animal life,” and the “sacred thought” of the elevation of\r\nhumanity above the animal is obscured. He then gives very beautiful\r\nexamples and modes of instruction for such sexual enlightenment of\r\nchildren twelve years of age.\r\n\r\nI myself am of opinion that, without in any way making light of the\r\ndifference between man and animal, the earlier elucidation at about the\r\nage of ten years should be associated with the general instruction in\r\nnatural history regarding the reproductive process of animals and\r\nplants; and then very gradually, up to the age of fourteen, all\r\nimportant points in this department can be explained, including,\r\nfinally, an account of the venereal diseases. It is obvious that after\r\nthis time, more especially in the dangerous years of puberty, systematic\r\nenlightenment must be continued. That which is good and useful in this\r\ndepartment of knowledge cannot be too often repeated.\r\n\r\nBut all enlightenment will be useless unless hand in hand with it there\r\nproceeds =a process of education of the character and the will=. Our\r\nschool youth thinks and dreams too much, and does too little. Up to the\r\npresent time it has been believed that it is sufficient to teach\r\nchildren, and to continue to teach them, to care for their health, to\r\nsee that they have good food and sound sleep, without also taking into\r\nconsideration the necessity for awakening the =individuality= and the\r\n=energy= slumbering in each one of them. The “gymnasium” must concern\r\nitself with the =gymnastics=, not only of the body, but also of the\r\nmind, and must thus restore that harmony between body and mind which\r\nappears to have been quite lost at the present day. Bodily education by\r\ngames and sports is only one of the means for this purpose. The\r\nprincipal aim is to strengthen the character, to induce the habit of\r\nself-command and self-denial by a profound and intimate grasp of sexual\r\nproblems. Nowhere does fantastic dreaming take revenge more thoroughly\r\nthan in sexual relationships, for which reason also the so-called “only\r\nchildren” are especially endangered;[701] nowhere do clear knowledge,\r\nobjective acquirements, and a firm will celebrate finer triumphs over\r\nblind impulses than they do here. The principal rule of sexual pedagogy\r\nruns as follows: Avoid the =first opportunity= and the =first contact=;\r\nkeep the child and the young man and the young woman at a distance from\r\nall the stimulating pleasures and enjoyments of the adult. The\r\nproduction of manliness, as it has recently been described by\r\nMosso,[702] Güssfeldt,[703] Georg Sticker,[704] and Ludwig Gurlitt,[705]\r\nhas the greatest importance, more especially as regards the sexual life.\r\nThis has been insisted on, above all, by Hans Wegener[706] and F. W.\r\nFörster (_op. cit._). Moral statistics have incontrovertibly proved that\r\nprogress in civilization and morals does not depend upon punishment or\r\nupon prophylactic measures against errors and excesses of passion, but\r\nonly upon the =subjective= improvement and strengthening of the single\r\nindividual. Guizot declared: “C’est de l’état _intérieur_ de l’homme que\r\ndépend l’état visible de la société.” Drobisch,[707] in his “Moral\r\nStatistics,” has established this fact yet more firmly. Energy is the\r\nmagic word for all vital activities of the present day, both spiritual\r\nand physical. Discipline, work, abstinence, bodily hygiene, are the\r\nmeans for educating the character, and these also play the principal\r\npart in sexual pedagogy.[708]\r\n\r\n  [696] For this reason, Fr. W. Förster, in his admirable “Jugendlehre”\r\n  (Berlin, 1906), devotes a special section to the subject of “sexual\r\n  pedagogy” (pp. 602-652).\r\n\r\n  [697] Maria Lischnewska, in her admirable work upon “The Sexual\r\n  Instruction of Children,” published in _Mutterschutz_, 1905, vol. i.,\r\n  pp. 137-150, quotes the principal passages relating to this subject\r\n  from the works of the writers just mentioned.\r\n\r\n  [698] In addition to the two admirable works already mentioned, by F.\r\n  W. Förster and M. Lischnewska, I may allude also to the following:\r\n  Richard Flachs, “Sexual Enlightenment as a Part of the Education of\r\n  our Young People,” with a full bibliography (Dresden and Leipzig,\r\n  1906); Carl Kopp, “Sexual Affairs in the Education of Youth” (Leipzig,\r\n  1904); Max Marcuse, “Sexual Enlightenment in Youth” (Leipzig, 1905);\r\n  “Sexual Hygiene and Sexual Enlightenment in the School” (a Discussion\r\n  at the First International Congress for School Hygiene, held at\r\n  Nürnberg, 1904), published in the “Reports of the German Society for\r\n  the Suppression of Venereal Diseases,” 1904, vol. ii., pp. 63-71; Karl\r\n  Ullmann, “The Sexual Enlightenment of School-Children,” published in\r\n  the _Monatsschrift für Gesundheitspflege_, 1906, No. 1; M.

W. Drobisch, “Moral Statistics and the Freedom of the Human\r\n  Will,” pp. 96-101 (Leipzig, 1867). Valuable works regarding the\r\n  education of the character and the social education of the child are\r\n  found in the first volume (second edition) of the monumental work\r\n  edited by Adele Schreiber, “The Book of the Child” (Leipzig and\r\n  Berlin, 1907), from the pens of Laura Frost (pp. 42-63), F. A. Schmidt\r\n  (pp. 168-179), Lüngen (pp. 192-201), G. Kerschensteiner (pp. 202-207),\r\n  R. Penzig (pp. 215-222), and Adele Schreiber (pp. 223-231). Important\r\n  in relation to sexual enlightenment is also the question (one actively\r\n  discussed at the present moment) of the =education of the sexes in\r\n  common=--the so-called =co-education=. It has been proved by\r\n  experience that co-education has a good effect in sexual relationships\r\n  (_cf._ Gertrud Bäumer, “Co-education,” _op. cit._, vol. ii., pp.\r\n  44-48).\r\n\r\n  [708] The question of sexual education and enlightenment occupies at\r\n  the moment a place in the foreground of public interest, and rightly\r\n  so; for upon this depends principally the further reform and the\r\n  resanation of all the sexual relationships of civilized peoples. For\r\n  this reason the Discussions, now in the press, of the Third Congress\r\n  of the Society for the Suppression of Venereal Diseases\r\n  (“Sexualpädagogik”), Leipzig, 1907, were occupied exclusively with\r\n  this subject, which was considered in elaborate debates from four\r\n  points of view:\r\n\r\n  1. Sexual instruction in the house and the school.\r\n  2. Sexual enlightenment of young persons at puberty.\r\n  3. Sexual instruction of teachers and parents.\r\n  4. Sexual dietetics and education.\r\n\r\n  The present position of sexual pedagogy in all these respects is\r\n  exactly defined in this comprehensive volume; and, in addition, at the\r\n  conclusion of the book we find a compend of the recent literature of\r\n  the subject. Much of value regarding sexual regimen is to be found in\r\n  the work of H. Mann, “Art and the Sexual Conduct of Life”\r\n  (Oranienburg, 1907), and in that of A. Eulenburg, “Sexual Regimen,”\r\n  published in _Mutterschutz_, July and August, 1907. As an opponent of\r\n  early sexual enlightenment, we must mention G. Leubuscher (“School\r\n  Medicine and School Hygiene,” pp. 65-70; Leipzig, 1907). He considers\r\n  that such enlightenment should only be given at the time of leaving\r\n  school. His reasons, however, are not convincing, and, above all, do\r\n  not apply to large towns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nNEO-MALTHUSIANISM, THE PREVENTION OF CONCEPTION, ARTIFICIAL STERILITY\r\nAND ARTIFICIAL ABORTION\r\n\r\n\r\n  “_Formerly the use of such devices was regarded as immoral and\r\n  punishable, and was actually punished; it was condemned as an\r\n  interference with the Divine plan.

Serious critical political economists, such as, for\r\nexample, B. G. Schmoller,[709] have recognized this. The increasing\r\nunderstanding of the conditions of social life, knowledge of the\r\nconnexion between economic conditions and the number and quality of the\r\npopulation, must of itself lead to the discussion of the question\r\nwhether the regulation of the number of children born is not one of the\r\nprincipal duties of modern civilization. The Englishman Robert Malthus\r\nwas the first who, stimulated by an idea of Benjamin Franklin, in the\r\nyear 1798, in his “Essay on the Principles of Population,” discussed\r\nthis serious, and even alarming, question of the natural =consequences=\r\nof unrestricted sexual intercourse, and answered it in an extremely\r\npessimistic sense. For, according to him, whereas human beings tend to\r\nincrease in number according to a geometrical progression--that is, in\r\nthe ratio 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on--the means of subsistence increase\r\nonly in arithmetical progression--that is, in the ratio of 1, 2, 3, 4,\r\n5, and so on. Hence it follows that the numbers of the population can be\r\nkept within bounds, so as to remain proportional to the nutritive\r\npossibilities, only by means of decimating influences, such as vice,\r\npoverty, disease, the entire “struggle for existence,” by preventive\r\nmeasures, and by the so-called “moral restraint” in and before marriage.\r\nAlthough this celebrated theory, which filled with alarm, not only all\r\nthose already living in Europe, but also all those who wished to\r\n=produce= new life, has to-day been generally recognized as false,[710]\r\nsince it failed to take into account technical advances in the\r\npreparation of the soil[711] and other ways in which it will become\r\npossible to increase the means of subsistence; and he equally ignored\r\nthe possibility of a better division of property. None the less does his\r\ntheory remain apposite in respect of many of the social relationships of\r\nmore recent times; the doctrine has, in fact, temporary validity for\r\ncertain periods of civilization, such as our own. Malthus recommended,\r\nas the principal means of preventing over-population, =abstinence= from\r\nsexual intercourse (moral restraint) before marriage, and the\r\n=postponement= of marriage; thus he was an apostle of the “relative\r\nasceticism” recommended in the twenty-fifth chapter of the present work.\r\n\r\nIn England this early view found utterance among the political\r\neconomists and sociologists, such as Chalmers, Ricardo, John Stuart\r\nMill, Say, Thornton, etc. It was also actively discussed in wide circles\r\nof the population, so that as early as the year 1825 the “disciples of\r\nMalthus” were a typical phenomenon of English life.\r\n\r\nA further development of malthusianism in the practical direction was\r\nrepresented by the so-called “neo-malthusianism”--that is, an actual\r\ndiffusion of instruction in the means for the prevention of pregnancy\r\nand for the limitation of the number of children. Such a procedure was\r\nfirst publicly recommended by Francis Place, in the year 1822; but no\r\nwidespread teaching of practical malthusianism occurred till a\r\nconsiderably later date, notably after the foundation of the Malthusian\r\nLeague, on July 17, 1877. The principal advocates of neo-malthusianism\r\nin England were John Stuart Mill, Charles Drysdale, Charles Bradlaugh,\r\nand Mrs. Besant.\r\n\r\nMalthusian practice is, however, much older than the theory.\r\nMetchnikoff[712] declares the endeavour to diminish the number of\r\nchildren to be a very widely diffused “disharmony of the family\r\ninstinct,” which in itself is much more recent, and is much less widely\r\ndiffused in the animal kingdom than the sexual instinct. Animals, at any\r\nrate, know nothing of the prevention of conception; that is a\r\n“privilege” of the human species. By primitive races such preventive\r\nmeasures are very widely employed. Among these measures one of the best\r\nknown is the “mica” operation of the Australian natives--the slitting up\r\nof the urethra of the male along the lower surface of the penis, so that\r\nthe semen flows out just in front of the scrotum, and is ejaculated\r\noutside the vagina.[713] Regarding the wide diffusion of artificial\r\nabortion among savage races, Ploss-Bartels gives detailed reports. The\r\npursuit of material enjoyments, characteristic of civilized peoples, is\r\nnot here (as recent authors have erroneously assumed) the determining\r\ninfluence; we have, in fact, to do with a widely diffused disharmony of\r\nthe family instinct,[714] for which in certain =definite= conditions\r\nsome justification must be admitted. The period for the unconditional\r\nrejection of malthusianism by pietists and absolute moralists has passed\r\naway definitely. Not only physicians, but also professional political\r\neconomists, recognize the relative justification and admissibility of\r\nthe use of preventive measures in certain circumstances for the\r\nlimitation of the procreation of children. It has rightly been pointed\r\nout[715] that in =every= marriage a time must eventually arrive when\r\npreventive measures in sexual intercourse are employed, and necessarily\r\nmust be employed, because, in respect of the state of health of the\r\nwife, and also in view of economic conditions, their use is urgently\r\ndemanded. These relationships have been discussed with great insight by\r\nA. Hegar,[716] and he has proved the justification of practical\r\nneo-malthusianism in every ordinary marriage, as well as for the\r\npopulation at large. By means of a “regulation of reproduction,” an\r\nimmoderate increase of the population is prevented; by diminishing the\r\nquantity we improve the quality of the offspring. Late marriages, long\r\npauses between the separate deliveries, and the greatest possible sexual\r\nabstinence, subserve this purpose.\r\n\r\nLike Hegar, the Munich hygienist Max Gruber[717] also recognizes the\r\nnecessity for setting bounds to the number of children to be brought\r\ninto the world, since the capacity of the human species to increase is\r\nfar greater than its power to increase the means of subsistence. He\r\ndescribes very vividly the physical and moral misery of the parents and\r\nthe children when the latter are too numerous; he also shows that from\r\nthe birth of the fourth child onwards the inborn force and health of the\r\nchildren diminish more and more. Naturally, also, diseases affecting the\r\nparents, and the pressing danger of the inheritance of these diseases,\r\nrenders necessary the use of sexual preventive measures, or else of\r\nmoral restraint. Gruber enunciates the thoroughly neo-malthusian\r\nproposition:\r\n\r\n  “The procreation of children must be kept within bounds, if mankind\r\n  wishes to free itself from the cruel condition by which, in irrational\r\n  nature, the balance is maintained--death in the mass side by side with\r\n  procreation in the mass!”\r\n\r\nL. Löwenfeld[718] also sees in the recommendation of such measures for\r\nthe prevention of pregnancy “nothing either improper or immoral”; he\r\nsees in these measures “means for diminishing the poverty of the lower\r\nclasses, and for abolishing, to a great extent, the high infantile\r\nmortality of these classes, although neo-malthusianism is in no way a\r\npanacea for all the social evils of our time”; and he writes very\r\nstrongly against the condemnation of preventive measures by a “perverse\r\nmedical zealotry”; in fact, he assigns to preventive measures an immense\r\nhygienic importance. Many other physicians also, such as Mensinga[719]\r\n(the discoverer of the occlusive pessary, the first medical man in\r\nGermany to assert with energy the justification of employing means for\r\nthe prevention of pregnancy, and the first to establish with precision\r\nthe indications for the use of these measures, especially in relation to\r\nthe disadvantageous consequences to women’s health of bearing a large\r\nnumber of children), Fürbringer,[720] Spener,[721] and others, have\r\ndrawn attention to the eminent hygienic and social importance of\r\nmeasures for the prevention of pregnancy; whereas, on the other hand, in\r\nFrance, in view of the alarming decline in the population of that\r\ncountry, scientific medicine has adopted a more hostile attitude; no\r\nlonger, however, so bitterly hostile as in the work (now somewhat out of\r\ndate, but nevertheless containing interesting details) of Bergeret.[722]\r\nA layman also, Hans Ferdy (A. Meyerhof),[723] has published a number of\r\ninteresting works on practical neo-malthusianism.\r\n\r\nWe shall now proceed to give a brief account of the means commonly\r\nemployed for the prevention of pregnancy.\r\n\r\nl. =The Restriction of Intercourse to Particular Periods.=--It is clear\r\nthat by means of relative asceticism, and by restriction of the number\r\nof individual acts of sexual intercourse, the possibilities of\r\nfertilization can be limited to a considerable extent. Thus, Capellmann,\r\nin a work published in 1883, entitled “Facultative Sterility, without\r\nOffence to Moral Laws,” recommended abstinence from intercourse for\r\nfourteen days =after= the cessation of menstruation and for three or\r\nfour days =before= the commencement of the flow, in the belief that\r\nfertilization occurs principally during the days immediately before and\r\nafter menstruation. Capellmann thus revived the prescription of Soranos,\r\na gynecologist of the days of antiquity. According to the researches of\r\nthe physiologist Victor Hensen, it is true that the greatest number of\r\nfertilizations take place during the =first= few days after the\r\nmenstrual period; but conception =may= also occur on any other day of\r\nthe menstrual cycle, although the probability of conception at other\r\nperiods than those named is a diminishing one. Feskstitow has based upon\r\nstatistical data an interesting “conception curve,” according to which\r\nthe frequency of fertilization on the last day of menstruation, on the\r\nfirst, ninth, eleventh, and twenty-third days after the end of the flow,\r\nvaries respectively according to the ratios 48, 62, 13, 9, 1; between\r\nthese points the course of the curve is almost straight. On the\r\ntwenty-third day after menstruation the probability of conception is\r\nthus one-sixty-second of the maximum. Thus, though the probability of\r\nfertilization following intercourse on the twenty-third day after the\r\ncessation of the flow is much =less= than the probability of\r\nfertilization as a result of intercourse shortly after menstruation,\r\nstill, the possibility of conception in the former case cannot be\r\nabsolutely excluded.\r\n\r\nIt has also been recommended that in certain =seasons of the year=, to\r\nwhich a peculiar influence upon fertility has been ascribed, more\r\nespecially the months of May and June, abstinence from intercourse\r\nshould be observed. But this is naturally =quite untrustworthy=, since\r\nthe same mother can conceive in all months of the year, as is\r\nsufficiently proved by the ordinary variations in the birthdays of\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nSomewhat more trustworthy, but still =not= absolutely to be depended\r\nupon, is the practice, after the birth of a child, of =artificially\r\nprolonging the period of lactation=, since it is well known that during\r\nlactation the menstrual periods often fail to occur, and that\r\nfertilization is exceptional. Upon the recognition of this causal\r\nsequence, notwithstanding the fact that it does not possess any absolute\r\nvalidity, there has recently been founded a very remarkable method of\r\npractical malthusianism, which the two discoverers, Karl\r\nButtenstedt[724] and Richard E. Funcke,[725] have announced to their\r\nastonished contemporaries as a “new revelation,” and as the realization\r\nof “happiness in marriage.” These remarkable apostles have combined\r\nanother observation with the one mentioned above of the relative\r\ninfertility of women during lactation, the new observation being that\r\nsometimes by the mammary glands of women who are not pregnant, and even\r\nby those of virgins, milk is secreted, especially during menstruation.\r\nThis fact was known to earlier gynecologists, as, for example, to\r\nDietrich Wilhelm Busch.[726]\r\n\r\nButtenstedt, to whom the “priority” of the new doctrine of happiness\r\nunquestionably belongs, an advocate of the extremely optimistic theory\r\nof the possibility of an everlasting life for humanity and of the\r\ncessation of death (!), also conceived the idea of evoking lactation\r\nartificially in =all= women by means of the sucking of their breasts by\r\nmen! In this way he believed that artificial sterility and amenorrhœa\r\nmight be produced.\r\n\r\nNaturally, also, woman’s milk is regarded as an elixir of life for old\r\nmen, a true panacea for the elongation of life _ad infinitum_; and this\r\n“happy marriage” in itself is to be a means by which all the possible\r\nills of degenerate humanity are to be cured. In this pæan he is joined\r\nby Funcke, who regards woman’s milk as “the best, most natural, and most\r\nvaluable drug,” and on p. 70 of his book preaches to girls and women the\r\n“new categorical imperative” (_sic_).\r\n\r\n  “Thou shalt not leave thy vital force unutilized; thou shalt not\r\n  menstruate unless thou hast the firm will and desire to become\r\n  pregnant; thou shalt allow thy vital force in the form of milk to flow\r\n  from thy breasts for the benefit and enjoyment of other human beings.”\r\n\r\nButtenstedt, who possesses some historical knowledge, wishes also to\r\nmake the breasts of men lactiferous (p. 24), so that the sexes can\r\nexchange their “blood through the breasts,” thus become more and more\r\nalike one another, and ultimately become urnings!\r\n\r\nThis beautiful lactation idyll or, more correctly, mammalian idyll, will\r\nnot bear the test of scientific criticism. In the first place, the\r\neffect of the proposed manipulations is exceedingly =dubious=, and would\r\nonly produce the desired result in exceptional cases; in the second\r\nplace, such an artificial lactation, continued for a long period, would\r\nbe extremely =harmful=, just as an excessive protraction of lactation\r\nafter normal delivery is known to be deleterious; and in the third\r\nplace, last, not least, the reputed anticonceptional effect would, in\r\nthe majority of cases, =fail to occur=. At any rate, there appears to be\r\nno reason why pregnancy should not ensue, since the condition of the\r\ngenital organs would apparently permit this, and would certainly differ\r\nfrom that which obtains in women who give suck in a normal manner after\r\ngiving birth to a child.\r\n\r\n2. =Divergences from the Normal Mode of Coitus.=--Attempts have been\r\nmade to prevent fertilization by means of various modifications of the\r\nsexual act. Thus, starting from the old belief that active participation\r\nin the sexual act on the part of the woman, as well as libido and the\r\nsexual orgasm on her part, are indispensable prerequisites of the\r\noccurrence of impregnation, a more passive demeanour of the woman has\r\nbeen recommended--a distraction of the mind and the senses from the\r\nsexual act, after the manner of the _cong-fou_ of the Chinese, who\r\nfrequently employ this trick during intercourse. This opinion is\r\ndeceptive, for, in the absence of all activity and orgasm on the part of\r\nthe woman, in the most diverse conditions possible, conception may\r\nensue.[727] Thus, in this case also we have to do with a quite\r\nuntrustworthy method.\r\n\r\n=Trustworthy=, on the other hand, and therefore extremely widely\r\ndiffused, is the so-called =coitus interruptus=--interrupted\r\nintercourse, in which the penis is withdrawn from the vagina shortly\r\nbefore the ejaculation of the semen (so-called “withdrawal,”\r\n“Zuruckziehen,” “Sichinachtnehmen,” “fraudieren,” “congressus\r\nreservatus, onanismus conjugalis”). The views regarding the harmfulness\r\nof this method, by which pregnancy can certainly be prevented, have in\r\nrecent years undergone considerable change, in so far as the\r\ndisadvantages are to-day considered less serious than they formerly\r\nwere. More especially, Dr. Alfred Damm, in his work “Neura,”\r\noverestimated the harmful effects of _coitus interruptus_, inasmuch as\r\nhe attributed to it the entire degeneration of a race. These extreme\r\nviews, supported by no facts whatever, of the degeneration fanatic Damm\r\nare briefly described in a little book by E. Peters, “The Sexual Life\r\nand Nervous Energy” (Cologne, 1906).[728]\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied--and has, in fact, been maintained by other\r\nphysicians such as Gaillard Thomas, Goodell, Valenta, Bergeret,\r\nMantegazza, Payer, Mensinga, Beard, Hirt, Eulenburg, Freud, von Tschich,\r\nGattel, and others--that the “ineffective” excitement occurring during\r\n_coitus interruptus_, the absence of the natural discharge of sexual\r\ntension, the voluntary postponement of ejaculation, the strain put upon\r\nthe will during the sexual act, may have a transient harmful influence\r\nupon the nervous system; but, according to recent researches, it is only\r\nin those who are =already= neuropathic that permanent troubles result,\r\nin the form of “=anxiety-neurosis=” (which, as Freud[729] has proved, is\r\nactually dependent upon _coitus interruptus_), or in the form of other\r\nneurasthenic and hysterical troubles, and also sometimes of local\r\nirritative conditions. The harmful influence of frustrated sexual\r\nexcitement is shown also by the frequency of nervous troubles during the\r\nperiod of engagement, which, as a witty colleague of mine remarked, must\r\nbe regarded as a single, long-drawn-out _coitus interruptus_. But it has\r\nnot been proved that in healthy individuals _coitus interruptus_, even\r\nwhen the practice is continued for a long time, gives rise to serious\r\nand permanent injuries to health. According to the experience of\r\nFürbringer, Oppenheim, von Krafft-Ebing, Rohleder, Spener, and, above\r\nall, of L. Löwenfeld, who has instituted exceptionally exact researches\r\ninto the matter, such consequences are quite exceptional. This is also\r\ntrue of the disorders which _coitus interruptus_ is reputed to cause in\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nAnother method for the prevention of pregnancy, which, according to\r\nBarrucco, is practised especially in Italy, is the prolongation of\r\nsexual enjoyment by means of =repeated= interruptions of the act,\r\nfollowed by =renewed= erections. This, naturally, is extremely harmful.\r\nFürbringer, however, reports the case of certain frigid men who were\r\nable to extend the act of conjugal intercourse for long periods, without\r\nany disastrous effect upon their health. One of these men was able to\r\nfind time during the act for smoking and reading!\r\n\r\n3. =Mechanical Means for the Prevention of Conception.=--According to\r\nKisch, in Transylvania and in France a method is in use according to\r\nwhich, during the sexual act, the woman, at the commencement of\r\nejaculation in the male, presses her finger forcibly upon the root of\r\nhis penis just in front of the prostate gland. In this way the passage\r\nthrough the urethra is temporarily occluded, and ejaculation of the\r\nsemen is prevented: it regurgitates into the bladder, and is\r\nsubsequently evacuated with the urine. Unquestionably this manipulation\r\nwould be likely to prove exceedingly injurious to health.\r\n\r\nIn Italy and in New Guinea many women expel the semen from the vagina,\r\nas soon as coitus is completed, by means of muscular action, by vigorous\r\nmovements of the perineum.\r\n\r\nA mechanical apparatus for the prevention of conception which is\r\nunquestionably carefully thought out is the so-called =occlusive\r\npessary= of Dr. Mensinga--a hemisphere of rubber surrounded by a steel\r\nring, introduced into the vagina before coitus, and even left _in situ_\r\nfor prolonged periods, so that the os uteri is occluded. When accurately\r\napplied, it does, in fact, definitely prevent fertilization. Various\r\nconsiderations, however, render its use undesirable: (1) the difficulty\r\nof the introduction, which most women are unable to master; (2)\r\nliability to displacement of the pessary during the act; (3) the\r\noccurrence of irritative conditions of various kinds (discharges,\r\ndiseases of the uterine annexa, etc.), if, as often happens, the pessary\r\nis allowed to remain in the vagina for a long time. Recently a pessary\r\nhas been constructed of waterproof cambric, which is said not to\r\nproduce any such irritative reaction. Moreover, Mensinga himself, and\r\nEarlet, have made other improvements upon the occlusive pessary. Easier\r\nto introduce is Gall’s “balloon occlusive pessary.” In this instrument,\r\nby means of a compressible rubber ball and tubing, air is blown into the\r\ninterior of a thin-walled rubber ring which surrounds a soft elastic\r\nrubber disc. A =dangerous= article, and =one to be avoided=, is\r\nHollweg’s “obturator.” The ideal mechanical means for the prevention of\r\npregnancy is, once more, the =condom=, regarding the application and\r\nqualities of which we have already said all that is necessary (_vide\r\nsupra_, pp. 378, 379). Simple in its mode of application, it is, when of\r\ngood quality, certain in its effect, and is relatively the =most\r\nharmless= of all preventive measures. When it is used, coitus runs a\r\nperfectly normal course, with the sole exception of the sensation during\r\nejaculation. We must reject as harmful the use of the so-called\r\n“stimulant condom,” which bears a ring of spines or points, in order to\r\nincrease libido in the woman.\r\n\r\n4. =Chemical Physical Preventive Measures.=--To these belong, above all,\r\n=douching= of the vagina immediately after sexual intercourse, for which\r\npurpose cold water, solutions of alum (1 per cent.), copper sulphate\r\n(1/2 to 1 per cent.), sulphate of quinine (1 : 400), etc., may be used.\r\nThe douching must be effected when the woman is in the recumbent\r\nposture, and the vaginal tube must be introduced deeply. This method,\r\nhowever, is very =untrustworthy=.[730]\r\n\r\nThe same is true of attempts to destroy the spermatozoa by the\r\ninsufflation of chemically active =powders=; or by the insertion of\r\nantiseptic “=security sponges=,” which Rohleder has rightly named\r\n“insecurity sponges”; untrustworthy also is the combination of these\r\nwith mechanical apparatus.\r\n\r\n  The number of articles belonging to this category is legion. I need\r\n  mention a few only: “Security ovals,” containing boric acid, quinine,\r\n  or citric acid; “little vaginal plugs”; “salus ovula”; Kamp’s\r\n  anticonceptional cotton-wool plugs; Hüter’s vaginal insufflator “for\r\n  the malthusian”; Noffke’s tampon-speculum; “spermathanaton”;[731]\r\n  Weissl’s preservative (a combination of speculum and rubber disc with\r\n  a steel spring and a cotton-wool plug impregnated with a drug); the\r\n  “Venus apparatus” (a double rubber ball, the smaller ball filled with\r\n  “Venus powder” (_sic_) being introduced within the vagina, whilst the\r\n  woman herself, at the moment of ejaculation, presses the larger ball\r\n  lying near to her thighs, whereupon the powder is expelled from the\r\n  smaller ball into the vagina); the “duplex occlusive pessary” (an\r\n  occlusive pessary with double walls, perforated with round apertures,\r\n  containing in its interior boric acid tablets for the purpose of\r\n  killing the spermatozoa).\r\n\r\nIt may be that now and again, by some of the means just mentioned,\r\nconception may be prevented. But on the whole they are very uncertain;\r\nand, on the other hand, it is doubtful if the chemical substances\r\nintroduced in this way are harmless. It is possible that many peculiar\r\ninflammatory conditions of the male and female genital organs may be\r\nreferred to their use. For example, Blumreich[732] reports the case of a\r\nman who, after coitus in which a means of this kind had been used, had\r\nan extremely obstinate inflammatory eruption upon the penis.\r\n\r\n  I take this opportunity of pointing out that the so-called =herpes\r\n  progenitalis=, a peculiar vesicular eruption of the genital organs,\r\n  occurring chiefly in males, which alarms a great many patients,\r\n  because they regard it as the result of syphilitic infection, is, in\r\n  the great majority of cases, a perfectly harmless affection caused by\r\n  some transient irritation.[733]\r\n\r\nBesides the above-mentioned methods for the prevention of pregnancy, we\r\nhave also to consider two radical means of practical malthusianism which\r\nbelong to the =purely medical= province, and can =only= be employed when\r\nlife and death are involved, when pregnancy and parturition would entail\r\nupon the woman severe illness or certain death. These two means are the\r\noperative induction of =artificial sterility= and =artificial abortion=.\r\n\r\nArtificial sterility can be produced by various measures, as by the\r\nintentionally effected =malposition= of the uterus, such as is practised\r\namong the indigens of the Malay Archipelago; by =section of the\r\nFallopian tubes=, as recommended by Kehrer; by the so-called _castratio\r\nuterina_ by means of =vaporization= (the application of superheated\r\nsteam by the method of Pincus, whereby menstruation is suspended and the\r\nuterine cavity is obliterated); and finally by =castration= proper, the\r\n=extirpation of the ovaries=[734] (=oöphorectomy=, spaying, Battey’s\r\noperation), which was carried out in ancient times by quite savage\r\nraces, in order to prevent reproduction.[735] In France, theoretically\r\nanti-malthusian, but practically through and through malthusian, in the\r\ncountry from which the song originates--\r\n\r\n   “Ah! l’amour, l’amour!\r\n    C’est le plaisir d’un jour\r\n    Pour le regret d’ neuf mois.”\r\n\r\n  [“Ah! love, love!\r\n    ’Tis the pleasure of a day\r\n    For the regret of nine months”]\r\n\r\n--it appears, according to recent descriptions,[736] that oöphorectomy\r\nis greatly prized by distinguished ladies as a means for the prevention\r\nof pregnancy. It is said that there even exist “specialists” for the\r\nproduction of these child-hating “_ovariées_,” men who undertake this\r\noperation at a high fee. In Germany, happily, this radical measure for\r\nthe prevention of conception is not employed in healthy persons; the\r\noperation is performed only in women who are seriously ill, and strictly\r\nfor therapeutic purposes.\r\n\r\nThe preventive measures previously mentioned, if we except _coitus\r\ninterruptus_ and the condom, are all very untrustworthy, as we learn\r\nfrom the extreme frequency of deliberate, artificial abortion in all\r\ncountries, and among all classes of the population.[737] Artificial\r\nabortion is, as is well known, a criminal offence, punishable by a long\r\nterm of imprisonment for all those concerned, the pregnant woman herself\r\nand her accomplices. In the Orient and among savage races, however,\r\nabortion is not punishable. Among the civilized nations of Europe\r\nartificial abortion is punished; in Germany the mere =attempt= at\r\nabortion is punishable, even though only an imaginary pregnancy is\r\npresent. That the State must take steps to prevent abortion, as an\r\nimmoral and unnatural action, is obvious, and this is necessary above\r\nall because intentional abortion in so many cases endangers the life and\r\nhealth of women. But in order that such punishment should be\r\nreasonable, it is essential that society should work to this end, that\r\nthe =social conditions= upon which the frequency of the practice depends\r\nshould be abolished; =society should abandon the artificial defamation\r\nof illegitimate motherhood=, and should in every possible way work for\r\nthe improvement of the possibilities of motherhood--should found homes\r\nfor mothers and for pregnant women, should provide for the insurance of\r\nmothers, etc. It is a remarkable contradiction, to which Gisela von\r\nStreitberg[738] draws attention, that illegitimate pregnancy is regarded\r\nas sinful and shameful: simultaneously the life of the child =about to\r\nbe born= is regarded as sacred; whilst this same child, =as soon as it\r\nis born=, is once more regarded as infamous. In fact, to the\r\nillegitimate child, in the social morality of our time, which is at once\r\nridiculous and profoundly perverted, there inevitably attaches something\r\ndespicable and dishonourable. It is right that those who make the\r\nprocuring of abortion a =professional occupation= should be severely\r\npunished; but, on the other hand, it is doubtful whether it is right to\r\npunish mothers, and more particularly the mothers of illegitimate\r\ninfants, against whom the Criminal Code is especially directed, for\r\nartificially inducing abortion. It is, in fact, open to question whether\r\nthe punishment is even legal. It is well known that according to § 1 of\r\nthe Civil Code the rights of a human being are said to begin only with\r\nthe completion of birth,[739] and it is certainly open to question\r\nwhether the as yet undeveloped human fœtus has any personal rights at\r\nall. Without doubt we have to do with a being which has not yet begun to\r\nexist, but which is only in process of becoming. Thus, juristically, and\r\nfrom the standpoint of the philosophy of law, the foundation for the\r\npunishment for abortion is a very unstable one. Consider, for example,\r\nimpregnation resulting from =rape=. Should not the woman concerned have\r\nthe right to employ any and all means available to her to destroy at the\r\nvery outset the child thus =forced upon her=?\r\n\r\nThe means for the induction of abortion[740] prior to the twenty-eighth\r\nor thirtieth week of pregnancy are very various, and may be considered\r\nunder the two categories of =internal= and =mechanical= means\r\nrespectively. Infallible internal abortifacients =do not exist=; and\r\nalmost all abortifacients are =dangerous= owing to their toxic effects.\r\nThose most commonly employed are ergot, ethereal oil of savin\r\n(_Juniperus sabina_), varieties of thuja, yew (_Taxus baccata_),\r\nturpentine, oleum succini, tansy, rue, camphor, cantharides, aloes,\r\nphosphorus, etc. Mechanically, abortion may be effected by blows, by\r\nviolent movements (for example, during coitus), massage, perforation of\r\nthe membranes, hot injections, steam, manipulations with the finger at\r\nthe os uteri, the introduction of sounds and other objects through the\r\nos uteri, venesection, application of the electric current, etc. With\r\nall these practices there is involved great danger of injury, poisoning,\r\ninfection, rupture and perforation of the uterus, the entry of air into\r\nthe uterine veins, scalding of the internal genital organs, etc. It is,\r\ntherefore, not to be wondered at that death so frequently ensues, and\r\nthat almost always severe illnesses result from the use of these\r\nabortifacients.\r\n\r\nThe State would in this way best put a stop to artificial abortion if,\r\nin addition to the above-mentioned removal of the disgrace attached to\r\nillegitimate motherhood, it diffused widely among all classes of society\r\na knowledge of the =permissible= means for the prevention of pregnancy.\r\n\r\nThe fact that neo-malthusian methods are chiefly employed =in large\r\ntowns=, indicates their dependence upon economical considerations, and\r\nupon the struggle for existence, which is especially severe in large\r\ntowns. Hope for the future rests upon the removal of moral and legal\r\ncoercion in marriage, in which Gutzkow (“Säkularbilder,” i. 174, 175)\r\nsaw the principal causes of social and sexual misery; and upon the\r\nrational regulation of methods for the prevention of pregnancy, which\r\nmust be regarded as in no way identical with the hostility to\r\n“fruitfulness” in the sense of Weininger. On the contrary, the yearning\r\nfor children, and the joy in their possession, will then, for the first\r\ntime, obtain their natural satisfaction.\r\n\r\n  [709] _Cf._ his classical essay, “Population: its Natural Subdivision\r\n  and Movement,” published in “Elements of General Political Economy,”\r\n  vol. i., pp. 158-187 (Leipzig, 1901).\r\n\r\n  [710] _Cf._ Franz Oppenheimer, “The Law of Population of T.

Widely renowned is the passage of the\r\n  historian Polybius (XXXVII. ix. 5) in which we read: “In my time the\r\n  whole of Greece suffered from =an insufficiency of children=--speaking\r\n  generally, from =a lack of men=; for men had become so much accustomed\r\n  to good living, to the greed for money, and to every comfort, that\r\n  =they no longer wished to marry, or, at any rate, they wished to have\r\n  only a few children=. Not the sword of the enemy was it that\r\n  depopulated the ancient States, but the lack of offspring.” In Spain\r\n  also, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, in consequence of\r\n  the wealth acquired in the New World, there resulted an overwhelming\r\n  dread of marriage and child-bearing, so that the population became\r\n  reduced to nine millions, and the bringing up of four children was\r\n  rewarded with a title of nobility (_cf._ J.

Here we merely propose to deal shortly with the\r\n=social= relationships of the hygiene of the sexual life. After Darwin,\r\nmore particularly in his work on the “Descent of Man,” had published\r\nfundamental observations regarding the social importance of sexual\r\nhygiene, other writers, influenced by recent anthropological and\r\nethnological research, occupied themselves with these problems, more\r\nespecially Hegar,[741] A. Ploetz,[742] and R. Kossmann;[743] the\r\nsubjects considered by these writers have been aptly comprised under the\r\nname “=reproductive hygiene=,” which constitutes a part of general\r\nracial biology.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, racial biology, as Max Gruber[744] justly remarks, has\r\nformed exaggerated estimates of the ideas of “degeneration” and\r\n“hereditary taint”; and, on the other hand, the complementary ideas of\r\n“regeneration” and “hereditary enfranchisement” have been unduly\r\nneglected. And yet it is certain that these latter influences are\r\ncontinually in active operation in the direction of the resanation and\r\ninvigoration of the race: that the introduction of =new and healthy\r\nblood= is competent to bring about reanimation and regeneration, even in\r\ndegenerate families. Gruber says with justice (“Hygiene of the Sexual\r\nLife,” p. 55, 1905):\r\n\r\n  “Completely normal, and entirely free from hereditary taint, no single\r\n  human being can be; and, on the other hand, experience teaches us,\r\n  that just as morbid tendencies make their appearance in certain\r\n  families, so also =they may disappear= from these families. Many of\r\n  these tendencies can be rendered ineffective by a suitably chosen mode\r\n  of life for the individual; and by means of repeated crossing with\r\n  stems which are free from these particular taints, the morbid tendency\r\n  can be led to disappear, unless the degenerative impulse is too\r\n  powerful.”\r\n\r\nThe recognition of this fact does not in the least diminish the great\r\nimportance of purposive choice in love and marriage; nor does it\r\ndiminish the sense of sexual responsibility in relation to the great\r\nfact of =heredity=. But the recognition of the fortunate fact of\r\nhereditary enfranchisement supports, on the other hand, all our\r\nendeavours in the direction of rational “eugenics” (Galton),[745] in\r\naccordance with which we must, as Nietzsche says, not merely reproduce,\r\nbut produce in an upward direction (“_nicht bloss fort-, sondern auch\r\n=hinaufpflanzen= sollen_”).\r\n\r\nThe central problem of reproductive hygiene is that of =love’s choice=,\r\nof sexual selection. It is a most difficult task, one which is rarely\r\nfulfilled to the utmost, for the right man to find the right woman, so\r\nthat their individualities may in every respect correspond to and\r\ncomplement one another. In most cases it is necessary to be contented\r\nwith relative harmony, and with sufficient =health= on both sides. The\r\nlaws of a refined, differentiated marriage choice have not yet been\r\ndiscovered. Havelock Ellis[746] has instituted exhaustive researches on\r\nthis subject, without, however, attaining any positive result. He was\r\nonly able to establish the general proposition, that in love’s choice\r\n=identity of race= and of =individual= characters (homogamy), and at the\r\nsame time =unlikeness in the secondary sexual= characters (heterogamy),\r\nare to be preferred. In other respects, however, very various and\r\ncomplicated influences are determinative in sexual selection. Havelock\r\nEllis also detected a natural disinclination towards love between\r\nblood-relatives, which, however, he regards as merely due to the\r\ncustomary life in close association from childhood onwards.\r\n\r\nDarwin propounded the principle for sexual selection, that both sexes\r\nshould avoid marriage when in any pronounced degree they were defective,\r\neither physically or mentally. Upon this idea rests the old and widely\r\ndiffused custom of killing or exposure of sickly children, as well as\r\nthe more recent prohibitions of marriage in certain States of the\r\nAmerican Union--for example, Michigan, in which the marriage (also\r\nsexual union for procreative purposes?) is forbidden on the part of\r\nthose mentally diseased and of those who are infected with tubercle or\r\nsyphilis.[747]\r\n\r\nThe most important fundamental principle, however, of rational\r\nreproductive hygiene is, without doubt, that only =healthy= individuals\r\nshould pair, or, at any rate, those only whose abnormalities or\r\ndiseases, if any, would not injure their offspring, physically or\r\nmentally. Not in disease itself, but in the =inheritance= of disease,\r\nlies the great danger for the deterioration of the family and the race.\r\nIt is for this reason that the study of the inheritance of morbid\r\npredispositions and morbid constitutions is of such enormous importance\r\nin racial biology.\r\n\r\nWith regard to illnesses to which attention must especially be paid in\r\nconnexion with sexual selection, we have here, in the first place, to\r\nconsider the “three scourges” of humanity: =alcoholism=, =syphilis=, and\r\n=tuberculosis=.\r\n\r\nApart from the fact that alcoholism leads in the drinker himself to\r\nnervous weakness, to mental disturbances of all kinds (delirium tremens,\r\nimbecility, mania, peripheral neuritis, etc.), it also exercises a very\r\nserious influence upon the offspring, who are, unfortunately, in many\r\ncases very numerous,[748] as the study of “drinker families” shows\r\n(_cf._ Jörger, “The Family Zero,” published in the _Archives for Racial\r\nBiology_, 1905, vol. ii., pp. 494-559). Only a very small fraction of\r\nthe offspring of such families are physically and mentally normal (about\r\n7 to 17 %); the majority display a =rapidly progressive degeneration=,\r\nwhich manifests itself physically more especially by the tendency to\r\ntuberculosis and epilepsy, and mentally by the tendency to drunkenness,\r\ncrime, and imbecility. Alcohol is a direct poison to the germ cells, so\r\nmuch so that, according to the degree of drunkenness, it is almost\r\npossible to estimate beforehand the degree of hereditary taint.\r\nMoreover, an =otherwise healthy= father, in a single severe acute\r\nalcoholic intoxication, may procreate a child either quite incompetent\r\nto live, or weakly, or completely degenerate. On the other hand, it has\r\nbeen observed that a person given to chronic alcoholism is competent,\r\nduring a temporary =diminution= in his consumption of alcohol, to\r\nprocreate a comparatively vigorous child. From this it follows that\r\nmarriage, or sexual union in general for reproductive purposes, with a\r\nman or woman addicted to alcohol, and no less the act of procreation in\r\na state of intoxication, are absolutely to be condemned.\r\n\r\nThe danger of alcoholism to the offspring is illustrated by the\r\nexperience that about one-eighth of the surviving children of drunken\r\nparents become affected with epilepsy, and that more than one-half of\r\nidiotic children are born of drunken parents (Kraepelin, “The\r\nPsychiatric Duties of the State,” p. 3; Jena, 1900).\r\n\r\nIn an earlier chapter (pp. 361-363) attention was drawn to the fact that\r\nsyphilis rivals alcohol in its potency as a cause of racial\r\ndegeneration.[749] Thanks to the researches of Alfred Fournier and of\r\nTarnowsky, the sinister influence of syphilis in this respect is now\r\nwidely recognized. E. Heddaeus rightly[750] asserts that since at the\r\npresent day the whole world is contaminated with congenital or acquired\r\nsyphilis, the eradication of syphilis is the most important task of\r\nreproductive hygiene. The previously mentioned etiological and\r\nprophylactic-therapeutic researches, among which may be included the\r\nquite recent discovery of syphilitic antibodies in the system of those\r\nwho have formerly suffered from syphilis,[751] open to us a prospect of\r\nthe realization of this magnificent idea. The weakening and degeneration\r\nof the individual by acquired and inherited syphilis, is also shown by\r\nthe recent researches into the influence of syphilis upon the duration\r\nof life, among which I may mention the works of A. Blaschko[752] and\r\nHans Tilesius.[753] Regarding the disastrous influence of syphilis\r\ncontinued into the second and third generations, see the monograph of B.\r\nTarnowsky, “La Famille Syphilitique et sa Descendence” [Clermont (Oise),\r\n1904]. (See note ^{325} to p. 363.)\r\n\r\nThe third disease leading to degeneration is tuberculosis, which may be\r\ninherited either by direct infection of the germ, or (more frequently)\r\nby the transmission of a predisposition to the offspring. This simple\r\npredisposition, recognized by the so-called “tubercular physique” (long,\r\nthin individuals, with a flattened chest, poorly developed muscles, and\r\na pale countenance), does not offer any absolute ground for prohibiting\r\nreproductive activity, since the health of the other party to the\r\nmarriage may diminish or entirely remove the danger of inheritance. But,\r\non the other hand, manifest tuberculosis or scrofula is a\r\ncontra-indication to marriage.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of actual =mental disorders=, of severe diatheses, such\r\nas gout, obesity, or diabetes; and of cancer and other malignant\r\ntumours; whereas the bulk of “nervous” affections and other bodily\r\ndiseases only exclude marriage in certain special circumstances.[754]\r\n\r\nVery unfavourable to the offspring is the atrophy of the female breasts,\r\nand the consequent incapacity for lactation, a matter to which\r\nMensinga,[755] G. von Bunge,[756] G. Hirth,[757] Emil Abderhalden,[758]\r\nA. Hegar,[759] and others, have referred, and which exercises a very\r\nunfavourable influence upon the offspring, since natural lactation\r\ncannot be adequately replaced by artificial feeding. According to Bunge,\r\nalcoholism, tuberculosis, syphilis, and mental disorders of the ancestry\r\nare the principal causes of atrophy of the mammary glands. Whether\r\natrophy of the mammary glands is really on the increase, and whether it\r\nis hereditary, are matters demanding, as Abderhalden insists, more\r\ncareful critical investigation.\r\n\r\nMarriage at an age =too youthful= (below twenty on the part of the\r\nwoman, below twenty-four on the part of the man) and at =too advanced=\r\nan age (above forty on the part of the woman, above fifty on the part of\r\nthe man) is also disadvantageous to the offspring, as manifested by\r\nhigher mortality of the infants, by the more frequent occurrence of\r\nmalformations, idiotcy, rickets, etc. Equally disadvantageous is =too\r\nclose relationship by blood=,[760] since in this way any unfavourable\r\ntendencies are greatly strengthened. Upon a certain degree of\r\ninbreeding, or, rather, upon an approximation to inbreeding, depends the\r\nformation of every race. The “racial problem” in this sense is a kind of\r\nexaltation of the inbreeding principle, for the very idea of =race=\r\nimplies a more or less close relationship between all the members of a\r\ndefinite stock. Thus the entire absence of fresh blood does not\r\nnecessarily give rise to any degeneration; but it is certain that\r\n=long-continued close in-and-in breeding= on the part of near\r\nblood-relatives in the same family results in a =progressive tendency to\r\ndegeneration=, because, among those who unite in marriage, the same\r\nmorbid tendencies are present, and accumulate in consequence of the\r\ninbreeding. This is shown very clearly by some statistics collected by\r\nMorris (published by Gruber, _op. cit._, p. 32). Marriage between uncle\r\nand niece, or between aunt and nephew, and the, unfortunately, far too\r\nfrequent marriages between first cousins, are therefore to be condemned.\r\n\r\nThe greatest value is to be placed, in love’s choice, upon\r\n=intellectual= qualities. Intelligent persons, and those full of\r\ncharacter, are to be preferred. Precisely in relation to the breeding of\r\ntalents, Nietzsche recommended (“Posthumous Works,” vol. xii., p. 188;\r\nLeipzig, 1901) polygamy for men or women of predominant intellectual\r\ncapacity, so that they might have the opportunity of reproducing their\r\nkind in intercourse with several persons of the opposite sex, and in\r\nthis way, since the later children of the same women are not so powerful\r\nnor of such striking capacity as the first-born, they might have the\r\npossibility of being the parents of several talented and distinguished\r\nindividuals. In relation to the woman’s question, the breeding of women\r\nwell endowed with talent is a matter of especial interest. Charles\r\nDarwin[761] writes:\r\n\r\n  “In order that woman should reach the same standard as man, she ought,\r\n  when nearly adult, to be trained to energy and perseverance, and to\r\n  have her reason and imagination exercised to the highest point; then\r\n  she would probably transmit these qualities chiefly to her adult\r\n  daughters. All women, however, could not be thus raised, unless\r\n  during many generations those who excelled in the above robust virtues\r\n  were married, and produced offspring in larger numbers than other\r\n  women.”\r\n\r\nIn a valuable work W. Schallmayer[762] has recently discussed the great\r\nimportance of the offspring of talented persons in the improvement of\r\nthe race, and has considered the details of psychical inheritance.\r\n\r\nAs in the entire animal world, so also in the human race, the feminine\r\nnature has a more conservative character, one more disinclined to\r\nvariations, whether favourable or unfavourable, as contrasted with the\r\nmore variable nature of the male, which is also more prone to submit to\r\ndegenerative influences. For this reason, in declining races, we meet\r\nmany more women free from degeneration than men. Carl Vogt, in a passage\r\nwhich appears to be very little known, writes on this subject in the\r\nfollowing terms:[763]\r\n\r\n  “It is the women, my friend, who maintain the race, who for the\r\n  longest time safeguard the type of the people in body and spirit, and\r\n  for this reason they form the mirror at once of the future and of the\r\n  past which are allotted to that people. You will no doubt have noticed\r\n  how, in many races, there exists a disharmony between men and women,\r\n  so that in one race the male and in another the female stands behind\r\n  the other in physical beauty and in mental development. This\r\n  relationship between the two sexes is precisely that from which we are\r\n  able to learn the past and the future of the nation. Good and bad,\r\n  advance and retrogression, are first undertaken by the man, and by him\r\n  passed to the woman, whose conservative nature much more gradually\r\n  yields to strange influences. But since the stages of mental culture\r\n  through which a race passes are not only reflected in its bodily\r\n  development, but actually depend upon this development, it is easy to\r\n  understand that in a nature which is striving upwards, which we see in\r\n  the process of advance towards better things, the men possess the\r\n  advantage in the matter of beauty and of intellectual capacity;\r\n  whereas when the race is a declining one, the advantages in these\r\n  respects will lie with woman. If you find a race in which the women\r\n  are beautiful, but as a rule the men are ugly and badly formed, you\r\n  can with certainty conclude that this race has long since passed its\r\n  culminating point in development, and has long been undergoing a\r\n  process of decline.”\r\n\r\nFor racial biology it is at least equally important, if not even more\r\nimportant, that healthy, vigorous, and talented men should reproduce\r\ntheir kind, rather than that in love’s choice the corresponding\r\nqualities in women should be regarded as determinative. Racial biology,\r\nif it really wishes to obtain success in the breeding of humanity, is\r\ncompelled to demand the abolition of the present evil coercive marriage\r\nmorality, and, according to the suggestions of Nietzsche, von Ehrenfels,\r\nand others, will not hesitate, =in certain cases=, to regard polygamy as\r\ndesirable, if only from this standpoint--that coercive marriage is the\r\nsole cause of the domination of “mammonism” in the sexual life, to the\r\ndeleterious influence of which we have before alluded.[764]\r\n\r\nMammonism is dangerous if for this alone, because it involves =the\r\nannihilation of the sense of sexual responsibility=, and in consequence\r\nof this, natural love is rejected on one side, and all considerations of\r\na racial hygienic nature are cast away on the other.

From very early times, indeed, sexual matters formed the\r\nprincipal constituent of the _chronique scandaleuse_, but it was not\r\nthen possible to disseminate such scandals by means of daily newspapers,\r\nas it is now so easy to do. In three forms at the present day the sexual\r\nlife attains publicity: in the form of an unscrupulous =quackery=; in\r\nthe form of =newspaper advertisements= relating to the sexual life; and\r\nin the form of =sexual scandals= diffused by means of the press. We\r\npropose to refer briefly to the principal aspects of all three, and we\r\nshall find that they are, for the most part, of an unpleasant character.\r\n\r\nAccording to the well-known saying that hunger and love rule the world,\r\nquackery has from its very earliest beginnings concerned itself by\r\npreference with the provinces of disorders of digestion and of sexual\r\ntroubles; and especially in respect of the latter have its developments\r\nbeen so astounding--in fact, there appears to be nothing else which\r\ngives such instructive information regarding the possibilities of human\r\nfolly, depravity, and superstition. When we regard the history of\r\nquackery and medical charlatanry of all times,[765] we discern beyond\r\nquestion the justice of the assertion that “=quackery is identical with\r\nthe diffusion of sexual vice and of fornication=.” These relationships\r\nof quackery to the sexual life and to sexual crime have recently had a\r\nvivid light thrown upon them by C. Reissig[766] and C. Alexander.[767]\r\n\r\n  Reissig deals more especially with the “immoral practices of many\r\n  magnetizers, lay hypnotizers, and similar individuals, who, under the\r\n  pretence of giving help to the sick, seek and find opportunity for the\r\n  gratification of =all kinds of immoral lusts=”; and he gives\r\n  characteristic examples of these practices. Police reports have shown\r\n  that numerous _masseuses_ and male quacks, who commonly appear under\r\n  the high-sounding names of “professor,” “director,” “hygienologist,”\r\n  “magnetopath,” etc., and who profess to treat “secret diseases” or\r\n  “diseases of women,” are in reality concerned with =abortion\r\n  mongering, the production of artificial sexual excitement, and the\r\n  provision of human material for the gratification of perverse lusts=.\r\n  Who does not know the ominous words, “_Rat und Hilfe!_” (“Advice and\r\n  help!”)? Under the mantle of quackery the worst kinds of immorality\r\n  are practised. Thus, Alexander (_op. cit._, p. 48) speaks of an “ear\r\n  specialist” who, paving the way by gigantic advertisements in the\r\n  local papers, travelled from place to place, nominally in order to\r\n  relieve “defects of hearing,” but who in reality utilized his\r\n  opportunities in order to make immoral attempts upon young girls\r\n  (Glatz Assizes, July 10, 1896). The “magnetizer” M---- hypnotized\r\n  young girls, and then violated them; another examined the genital\r\n  organs when professing to treat ear troubles, and carried out improper\r\n  manipulations. In an article, “Serene Highness’s Quackery,” in the\r\n  _Aerztliche Vereinsblatt_, No. 418, August, 1900, Dr. Reissig reports\r\n  that “to Her Serene Highness the Princess Maria von Rohan in Salzburg”\r\n  it appears to be a sacred duty to bear witness to the joiner (!)\r\n  Kuhne, in Leipzig, under date November 9, 1889, that his sexual\r\n  friction baths (!) “had proved to be of inestimable value, and had had\r\n  a wonderful effect,” and she felt impelled “to recommend to physicians\r\n  the most careful examination and trial of this new method of cure.”\r\n\r\nThe treatment of “secret diseases,”[768] in the hands of quacks, does\r\nincredible harm; and the same is true of the uncleanly and dangerous\r\npractices of “masseuses” and of professional abortion-mongers. Closely\r\nconnected with quackery is the =trade in sexual nostrums and in other\r\narticles of immoral use=.[769] This trade is occupied in the manufacture\r\nand public recommendation of “sexual articles” of every kind:\r\naphrodisiacs; “protective articles”; various celebrated measures for the\r\nrelief of “sexual weakness,” infertility, pollutions, lack of voluptuous\r\nsensation, etc. The artificial sterilization, not of women, but of men,\r\nby means of Roentgen rays is recommended.[770] The newspapers overflow\r\nwith advertisements recommending all these articles. Beneath the aliases\r\nof “chiromancy” and “astrology,” sexual quackery also lies concealed. It\r\nallures its clients chiefly by means of newspaper advertisements.\r\n\r\nNewspaper advertisements for sexual purposes are not more than 200 years\r\nold. Their oldest and most harmless form was that of matrimonial\r\nadvertisements, the first two of which appeared on July 19, 1695, in the\r\n_Collection for the Improvement of Husbandry and Trade_, published by\r\nHoughton, the father of English advertising.[771] These two remarkable\r\nand historical advertisements run as follows:\r\n\r\n  A gentleman, thirty years of age, who says that he has considerable\r\n  property, would be glad to marry a young lady with property amounting\r\n  to about £3,000. He will make a suitable settlement.\r\n\r\n  A young man, twenty-five years of age, with a good business, and whose\r\n  father is prepared to give him £1,000, would be glad to make a\r\n  suitable marriage. He has been brought up by his parents as a\r\n  dissenter, and is a sober man.\r\n\r\nWe see that from the very outset matrimonial advertisements did not\r\nforget the _punctum saliens_, which I need not specify.[772] All, down\r\nto those of the present day, are alike. The only difference is that, in\r\naddition to these “money marriages,” advertisements of “nominal\r\nmarriages” and also of “marriages for position” appear freely in the\r\npapers. The majority of matrimonial advertisements are inserted for\r\nmercenary or interested purposes, and really belong to the category of\r\n“=immoral advertisements=,” which conceal themselves under all possible\r\ntitles. I give a short classification of some of the commonest immoral\r\nadvertisements, and append some actual advertisements of each kind taken\r\nfrom leading German and Austrian newspapers.\r\n\r\n1. =Loan Advertisements.=--In most cases a “young,” “smart” lady begs an\r\nolder gentleman for a loan, or _vice versa_, a young man directs the\r\nsame request to a “lady belonging to the best circles.” Frequently also\r\nit is a “lady living alone,” “a young widow,” or a “recently married\r\nwoman,” who, “without the knowledge of her husband,” and “in temporary\r\nwant of money,” seeks a “helper.” Almost invariably the need and the\r\nmarriage are fictitious. These are in most cases the advertisements of\r\nsecret prostitutes, of a similar character to the advertisements of\r\n_masseuses_. The following advertisement must otherwise be interpreted:\r\n\r\n  What noble-minded lady would be willing to lend, to a young,\r\n  widely-travelled engineer, the sum of 12,000 marks [£600], for six\r\n  months, on good security?\r\n\r\n2. =Acquaintanceship Advertisements, Friendship Advertisements, and\r\nEmployment Advertisements.=--These may be divided into the two classes\r\nof heterosexual and homosexual advertisements. Examples of the former\r\nare the following:\r\n\r\n  A young widow, twenty-seven years of age, desires friendly intercourse\r\n  with a man of position, who will assist her with word and deed.\r\n\r\n  A young stranger desires acquaintanceship (!) to relieve her of a\r\n  temporary difficulty.\r\n\r\n  A merchant, a man of middle age, desires the acquaintanceship of a\r\n  good-looking lady (a slender figure preferred), for the purpose of\r\n  friendly intercourse.\r\n\r\nThe following advertisements have a more or less definite homosexual\r\nnote:\r\n\r\n  A well-placed young lady, nearing the age of thirty, desires an\r\n  honourable, trustworthy lady friend.\r\n\r\n  A cultured lady of middle age desires a ladies’ club.\r\n\r\n  A well-placed elderly gentleman desires friendly intercourse with a\r\n  young man.\r\n\r\n  A young merchant, between twenty and thirty years of age, desires\r\n  friendly intercourse with a young man of good family.\r\n\r\n  A young lady, a stranger to the town, desires a lady friend; apply by\r\n  letter to “Lesbos” at the office of this paper.[773]\r\n\r\nA newspaper, now defunct, which formerly appeared in Munich,\r\ncharacterized by homosexual “psychologico-erosophical” tendencies,\r\nentitled _Der Seelenforscher_ (edited by August Fleischmann), appears to\r\nhave laid itself open to such advertisements. In No. 11 of the second\r\nyear of issue, November, 1903, I find the following distinctive\r\nadvertisements:\r\n\r\n  A young vigorous (!) man, a Swiss, twenty-four years of age, well\r\n  recommended, desires a situation with a gentleman living alone.\r\n\r\n  A young man, twenty years of age, of agreeable appearance, with an\r\n  honourable and ideal mind, desires a position as correspondent or\r\n  companion in the house of a well-to-do, even if elderly, gentleman.\r\n\r\n  A wealthy, talented uranian young man desires the patronage of a noble\r\n  well-to-do urning.\r\n\r\n  A good, affectionate, and bright young man, who at the present time is\r\n  in an official position, desires to find a =well-to-do, kind-hearted,\r\n  and lonely gentleman=, to whom he could be a true life-companion, and\r\n  to whom, until the end of his life, he would give true affection. He\r\n  would faithfully fulfil all his duties.[774]\r\n\r\nThe numerous advertisements, also, in which young girls and women, or\r\nwidows, desire “positions” as housekeepers, companions, etc., in the\r\nhouses of “well-to-do” gentlemen “living alone” have, as a rule, an\r\nimmoral basis.\r\n\r\n3. =Advertisements regarding Correspondence.=--These also form a\r\npermanent constituent of the advertisements of the daily papers, and\r\nserve in part the aims of prostitution or of assignations for sexual\r\nintercourse, but in part really aim at an exchange of more or less\r\nerotic letters, as is obviously the case in respect of the following\r\nadvertisements:\r\n\r\n  Young cultured man desires a stimulating (!) correspondence with a\r\n  young lady.\r\n\r\n  Young lady desires to enter into correspondence with a lady of good\r\n  position, with similar ideas.\r\n\r\n4. =Advertisements of Rooms.=--Among these advertisements, we find that\r\nof the “convenient room” or the room “with a separate entrance”--the\r\n“storm-free diggings” of the student. Such rooms are usually offered to\r\nmen; women must seek them for themselves, as in the following\r\nadvertisement:\r\n\r\n  A lady artist desires a well-furnished convenient room, with bath-room\r\n  and piano, as an only tenant.\r\n\r\nThe advertisements regarding rooms to be let “during the day” mostly\r\nrefer to opportunities for fornication (“houses of accommodation”).\r\n\r\n5. =Pseudo-Educational Advertisements.=--Here also there is a form of\r\nadvertisement which enables us without difficulty to recognize their\r\ntrue purpose--for example:\r\n\r\n  A young Englishwoman gives stimulating instruction.\r\n\r\n  =Jeune= Française, =gaie= (!), bien recomm. qui enseigne de méthode\r\n  facile et rapide, donne des léçons.\r\n\r\nVery frequent are announcements of sadistic or masochistic\r\n“instruction,” in which the “energy” or “imposing appearance” of the\r\ninstructor or instructress is emphasized, or in which the word\r\n“discipline” is displayed in a significance which cannot be\r\nmisunderstood.\r\n\r\n6. =Rendezvous and Postilion d’Amour Advertisements.=--These subserve\r\nthe appointment of lovers, often adulterous lovers; but also the opening\r\nup of acquaintanceship. Examples:\r\n\r\n  Veronika.\r\n\r\n  To-day unfortunately prevented, therefore 21st.\r\n\r\n  =“Wireless Telegraphy.”=\r\n\r\n  Best thanks for dear letter. Drive to-day. A thousand kisses.--L.\r\n\r\n  =“Good Report.”=\r\n\r\n  A letter will be found addressed to “Sophie G.,” post restante,\r\n  Vienna, I/1, principal post-office.\r\n\r\n  =M.S.A.=\r\n\r\n  To-day, 4. Please bring news. Most intimate.--K. D. D.\r\n\r\n  =A. 15.=\r\n\r\n  Je n’oublie pas et j’espère.\r\n\r\nVery frequent also are requests from male advertisers, addressed to\r\nladies they have chanced to meet in the railway, electric tram, etc.,\r\nasking where the latter may live. These advertisements give a\r\ndescription of the appearance, costume, time, and place of the first\r\nmeeting, and beg the lady to give her address “in confidence,” or to\r\ncome to some specified place of meeting. A very large number of =letters\r\naddressed post restante= are of an erotic nature, and belong to this\r\ncategory.\r\n\r\n7. =Private Inquiries.=--Under this heading persons advertise in the\r\nnewspapers that for an honorarium (usually a very high one) they will\r\nundertake to watch secretly any desired person--and almost invariably\r\nsuch watching relates to the sexual life and activity of the person\r\nunder observation; when employed, they use all the methods of the most\r\nunscrupulous detective. These individuals play a principal part in\r\ndivorce proceedings, and in conjugal quarrel based upon jealousy; they\r\nare a cancer of our time[775] which cannot be too energetically\r\nsuppressed. A detective advertisement of this character is the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n  =Private Inquiry.=\r\n\r\n  Confidential! Enlightening! Unfailing! Truthful! Universal!\r\n  Extraordinarily satisfactory conjugal inquiries; mode of life, family\r\n  relationships, liaisons, peculiarities of character, occupations,\r\n  present condition, past misconduct, future prospects, state of\r\n  property, secret intercourse, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n8. =Advertisements relating to Sexual Perversions.=--We have already\r\nreferred to homosexual advertisements. An even more important part is\r\nplayed by =sadistic= and =masochistic= advertisements, which usually\r\nappear under the cloak of “massage,” “instruction,” or of an\r\n“energetic” person. Examples:\r\n\r\n  =Masoch.= Who is interested in this matter? Address “Kismet,” office\r\n  of this paper.\r\n\r\n  Widow of noble birth, middle-aged, =energetic=, desires position in\r\n  the house of a gentleman of standing, as reader, or in some other\r\n  capacity.\r\n\r\n  Cabinet de massage, par dame diplômée, hydrothérapie. Mme. D., 82, Rue\r\n  Blanche.\r\n\r\n  Massage suédois, par dame diplômée, tous les jours de 10 à 8 heures.\r\n\r\n  Madame Martinet, leçons de maintien....\r\n\r\n  Monsieur dés. gouvernante gr. et forte, 40 a. =sévère= pour educ.\r\n  enfant diffic. A. B. p.r. Amiens.\r\n\r\n  =Energetic= distinguished lady, in temporary need, wishes to receive a\r\n  considerable loan, but will meet only the actual lender.\r\n\r\n  Severin is seeking his Wanda!\r\n\r\n  A young man begs 30 marks from a lady. “Sacher Masoch,” Post Office,\r\n  Köpenickerstrasse.\r\n\r\nEven fetichistic advertisements sometimes appear, such as the following,\r\nfrom a shoe fetichist:\r\n\r\n  A young man of means buys for his private collection elegant shoes,\r\n  which have been worn by leading actresses, or by ladies of high rank.\r\n\r\n9. =Handbills.=--In large towns these are distributed by persons\r\nstanding at the street corners, and usually relate to restaurants with\r\nwomen attendants. One example will suffice:\r\n\r\n  =The Restaurant of the Good-Natured Saxon Girl.=\r\n\r\n  The attendants at this restaurant are young and pretty girls from\r\n  Saxony; Miss Elly waits at the bar. Piano-playing and singing. Your\r\n  kind patronage is requested by =The Young Hostess=.\r\n\r\n“Chiromantists,” magnetopaths, and other charlatans, advertise\r\nthemselves by means of street handbills. In the Latin countries, and\r\nmore especially in Paris, true “=brothel guides=” stand at the street\r\ncorners, and conduct the passers-by to improper dramatic\r\nrepresentations, or provide for them children for fornicatory purpose,\r\nor invite them to homosexual intercourse, etc.\r\n\r\nThe third form under which the sexual life makes a public appearance is\r\nthat of the great scandals and sensational occurrences with a sexual\r\nbackground, which are discussed by the press. I allude here, without\r\nattempting completeness, to =murders= and =suicides= arising from\r\njealousy, from rejected love, or from love unsuccessful for some other\r\nreason--occurrences which afford sufficient proof that individual\r\n=falling in love= in our own time is just as violent and passionate as\r\nit was formerly; further, to =abduction= and =seduction=; to =divorce\r\nscandals= and =divorce proceedings=; in general, to all =law-court\r\nproceedings relating to sexual offences=; to =duels= dependent upon\r\nerotic motives; to =family tragedies= upon a similar basis; to the great\r\n=procuress trials=; to the discovery of =secret sexual clubs= and of\r\n=erotic orgies=; to =revelations from nunneries and from secular\r\ninstitutions=; to the exploits of =swindlers=, who very frequently make\r\nuse of sexual passion in others to assist them in their pursuit of\r\nplunder, etc. Examples of all these varieties of scandals and\r\nsensational occurrences are found day by day in the newspapers. Very\r\nfrequently, on account of the very nature of sexual psychology, they\r\nexercise a suggestive influence, so that we often hear of similar\r\noccurrences at brief intervals. If we assume the existence of psychical\r\ncontagion, there is no doubt that these sensational newspaper reports\r\nplay a far greater part therein than the =whole= of the so-called erotic\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\n  [765] _Cf._ the valuable historical and critical monograph of\r\n  Professor Wilhelm Ebstein, “Charlatanry and Quackery in the German\r\n  Empire” (Stuttgart, 1905).\r\n\r\n  [766] C.

In order to obtain an\r\naccurate and objective definition of this idea, we must always keep\r\nclearly before our minds the distinction between “=pornography=” and\r\n“=eroticism=.” The confusion between these two ideas explains the great\r\nconflict of opinion on the part of expert witnesses in connexion with\r\nthe question whether any specified book or picture is to be regarded as\r\n“immoral” or “indecent.”\r\n\r\nThe obscene differs _toto cœlo_ from the erotic. In my own possession is\r\na rare work which is probably the first monograph regarding obscene\r\nbooks. It dates from the year 1688, and is the thesis of a Leipzig\r\ndoctor.[776] At that time it was still possible to compose =academic=\r\nessays upon such topics. To-day this would only be possible in the legal\r\nfaculty and from the criminal standpoint. In respect of the unprejudiced\r\nscientific and historical consideration of pornography, we have\r\nexperienced a notable retrogression, and at the present day a certain\r\ndegree of courage is needed to make these things an object of scientific\r\nstudy, to consider in an unprejudiced and objective manner these\r\npeculiar outgrowths of the human soul.\r\n\r\nIn the above-mentioned essay the learned writer gives, on p. 5, a\r\ndefinition of the obscene, which shows that he had not thoroughly\r\ndifferentiated it from the erotic, but confused the two ideas under the\r\nsame term. In his view, obscene writings are “all such writings whose\r\nauthors use distinctly improper language, and speak plainly about the\r\nsexual organs, or describe the shameless acts of voluptuous and impure\r\nhuman beings, in such words that chaste and tender ears would shudder to\r\nhear them.”\r\n\r\nBut such improper descriptions might occur in a work without its being\r\npossible to designate this as obscene. =A book can justly be called\r\nobscene only when it has been composed simply, solely, and exclusively\r\nfor the purpose of producing sexual excitement=--when its contents aim\r\nat inducing in its readers a condition of coarse and brutish sensuality.\r\n\r\nThis definition clearly excludes all those literary products which,\r\nnotwithstanding the existence of isolated erotic, or even obscene,\r\npassages, =are yet composed for purposes radically different from that\r\nabove described=--it excludes, for example, artistic, religious, and\r\nscientific works (the history of civilization, poetry, belles-lettres,\r\nmedicine, folk-lore, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe question, namely, whether =simple sexual relationships= can properly\r\nbe made the object of =artistic= or =scientific= representation, may be\r\nanswered with an unconditional affirmative, if we presuppose a purely\r\nartistic or scientific critical representation and consideration of\r\nerotic objects; that is to say, in the work of art, or the scientific\r\nwork, as the case may be, the purely sexual must completely disappear\r\nbehind the higher artistic or scientific conception. This is possible\r\nonly when that which is represented is =completely devoid of actuality=;\r\nwhen time and place are entirely ignored, so that the object is regarded\r\nrather from its =general human= aspect; and when, further, in the\r\nartistic representation of the purely sexual we find expression also, on\r\nthe part of the artist, of a conception enlightening and to a degree\r\n=overcoming= the purely physical; or when, finally, on the part of the\r\nman of science, we recognize a critical point of view, by means of which\r\nthe =causal= relationships of the sexual find expression.\r\n\r\nThe =general tendency= is determinative, not the shocking individual\r\ndetail. I need not waste any more words upon the importance of medical,\r\nethnological, psychological, and historical works upon the sexual\r\nlife.[777] This fact is, fortunately, now fully recognized even by the\r\ngreatest morality fanatics, and it would hardly now be possible in\r\nGermany that a law-court--as recently in Belgium[778]--should witness\r\nproceedings against a medical undertaking on account of pornographic (!)\r\nillustrations.[779]\r\n\r\nThe same is true of the artistic consideration of sexual matters. For\r\nexample, how readily everything sexual lends itself to the =humorous=\r\npoint of view! How short here is the step from the sublime to the\r\nridiculous! In a copy which lies before me of Fr. Th. Vischers’ first\r\nwork, “The Sublime and the Ridiculous” (Stuttgart, 1837), which was once\r\nin the possession of a friend of Goethe, the Driburg physician, Anton\r\nTheobald Brück, we find on p. 203, in his handwriting, the apt marginal\r\nnote: “Wit gilds the nickel of the obscene.” Sexual matters actually\r\nprovoke humour. This fact was enunciated by Schopenhauer, and was\r\nascribed by him to the profound earnestness which underlies the sexual\r\n(“Welt als Wille und Vorstellung,” i., 330). For this reason, as Eduard\r\nFuchs[780] rightly insists, the majority of all erotic creations are of\r\nthe nature of caricatures. The most brilliant advocate of this humorous\r\nview of sexual matters is the brilliant English artist Thomas\r\nRowlandson, whose works, both in England and in Germany, have long been\r\nkept under lock and key.\r\n\r\nThe =mystic-satanic= element in the sexual also stimulates artistic\r\nrepresentations, and in the works of Baudelaire, Barbey d’Aurevilly,\r\nFélicien Rops, Aubrey Beardsley, Toulouse Lautrec, etc., we see that the\r\n“perverse” also is thoroughly capable of erotic representation. But even\r\npure obscenity, without any underlying idea--as, for example, we see it\r\nto-day in the obscene drawings of Carracci--may have the effect of a\r\nsimple artistic product, if the taste of the onlooker is so far matured\r\nthat the purely sexual can recede completely behind the artistic\r\nconception. We must, generally speaking, not fail to take into account\r\nthe individuality and the age of the spectator or reader. For =children=\r\nand =immature= persons, even works that are obviously =not obscene=,\r\nsuch as artistic, religious, and scientific literature, may, in certain\r\ncircumstances, be dangerous--works which adults regard and judge in the\r\nspirit of their own time, as, for example, the =Bible= and the writings\r\nof the =Fathers of the Church=. John Milton, who was certainly not\r\nlacking in piety, wrote: “The Bible often relates =blasphemies= in no\r\nvery delicate manner; it describes the =fleshly lusts of vicious men=\r\nnot without elegance.”[781] =Books which are to be read by children=\r\ncannot be chosen too carefully, for a very large proportion also of the\r\nliterature which is not, properly speaking, obscene, but which deals\r\nwith sexual matters, has =upon the childish imagination= an effect\r\nequivalent to that of true pornography upon the adult.\r\n\r\nIn passing judgment on an erotic work, we must, finally, take into\r\nconsideration the =standard of the epoch= to which the work belongs; we\r\nmust bear in mind the nature of the =contemporary moral ideas=. Much\r\nwhich to us to-day appears obscene was not so in the middle ages. On\r\nthe other hand, we must not excuse everything on this plea, for our\r\nforefathers were also familiar with pornographic and utterly obscene\r\nbooks. Works such as those of the Marquis de Sade or of Nicolas Chorier\r\n(“Gespräche der Aloysia Sigaea”) have not only an importance in the\r\nhistory of civilization: they also have an interest for anthropologists\r\nand medical men. They constitute remarkable documents of the nature and\r\nmode of manifestation of sexual perversities in earlier times. Moreover,\r\nall pornographic writings afford us valuable assistance in our study of\r\nthe genesis of sexual perversions. But while we admit the importance of\r\nsuch writings--for example, those of de Sade--to learned men and\r\nbibliophiles, we cannot condemn in sufficiently strong terms the insane\r\nundertaking of translating de Sade’s books in our own day. This is\r\nsimply pornology; for all those who, as medical men, psychologists, or\r\nhistorians of civilization, are occupied with pornographic literature,\r\nare--or, at any rate, should be--competent to read these authors in the\r\noriginal tongue.[782] I feel therefore that the mass of recently\r\npublished German translations of the pornographic writings of John\r\nCleland, Mirabeau, Nerciat, de Sade, of the “Antijustine” of Rétif de la\r\nBretonne, of the “Portier des Chartreux,” of Alfred de Musset’s\r\n“Gamiani,” etc., can only be described as pornography, although I must\r\nadmit that the original editions are often inaccessible to the\r\nscientific student interested in the matter, who in such cases must,\r\n_faute de mieux_, content himself with translations.\r\n\r\nThese obscene writings may be compared with =natural poisons, which must\r\nalso be carefully studied=, but which can be entrusted =only to those=\r\nwho are fully acquainted with their dangerous effects, who know how to\r\ncontrol and counteract these effects, and who regard them as an object\r\nof natural research by means of which they will be enabled to obtain an\r\nunderstanding of other phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe pornographic element of literature and art[783] has an ancient\r\nhistory. In Greece, Rome, and Egypt, but more especially in India,\r\nJapan, and China, there existed an extensive obscene literature. In\r\nEurope the =French=, =Italian=, and =English= obscene literature\r\noccupies the first place as regards comprehensiveness and wide\r\ndiffusion. Exceptionally dangerous in their effect are French\r\npornographic writings, because their mode of expression is so elegant,\r\nwhereas the English obscene books, with the single exception of\r\nCleland’s “Fanny Hill,” are positively deterrent, on account of the\r\ncoarse phraseology employed in them. The German writings in this\r\ndepartment are not much better than the English, and consist to a large\r\nextent of bad translations of foreign pornographic works--if we except a\r\nfew older writings, which are repeatedly reissued, such as the\r\n“Denkwürdigkeiten des Herrn von H.,” by Schilling, or the “Memoiren\r\neiner Sängerin,” the first part of which is ascribed to the celebrated\r\nWilhelmine Schröder-Devrient. Speaking generally, it is a remarkable\r\nphenomenon (and one which is in flat contradiction to the assertion so\r\nfrequently made that pornography and true art cannot possibly be\r\nassociated) that so many spirits of the first rank, great artists either\r\nin literature or plastic art, have enriched pornography themselves by\r\nworks of their own, or, failing this, have at least been notorious\r\nlovers of pornography. This fact was clearly manifested at the time of\r\nthe Italian renascence, but it can be traced down to the present day.\r\nMen like Voltaire (“La Pucelle d’Orléans”), Mirabeau (“L’Éducation de\r\nLaure,” “Ma Conversion,” etc.), Alfred de Musset (“Gamiani”), Guy de\r\nMaupassant (“Les Cousines de la Colonelle”), Théophile Gautier (“Lettre\r\nà la Présidente”), and Gustave Droz (“Un Été à la Campagne”), have\r\nwritten indubitably pornographic books. But the heroes of our own German\r\nliterature have not been free from such tendencies. Goethe not only\r\nwrote the “Tagebuch,” but composed other (=still completely unknown=)\r\nerotica, which, by command of the Grand Duchess Sophie, were sealed and\r\nhidden away.[784] Schopenhauer,[785] who said to Frauenstädt that a\r\nphilosopher must be active, “not only with his head, but also with his\r\ngenital organs,” was a lover of pornography, even of a skatological\r\ncharacter, and was fond of telling “bawdy stories which will not bear\r\nrepetition”--for example, he would enumerate the different kinds of\r\nkissing, describe the varieties of the sexual impulse, etc.[786]\r\nSchiller and Goethe enjoyed reading Diderot’s “The Nun” (“La\r\nReligieuse”) and his “Bijoux Indiscrets,” Rétif’s “Monsieur Nicolas,”\r\nand the “Liaisons Dangereuses” of Choderlos de Laclos, books which would\r\nnowadays be suppressed as “immoral.” Lichtenberg also was a very zealous\r\nreader, and a connoisseur, not only of erotic, but also of pornographic\r\nliterature. In his letters he alludes to reading such pornographic works\r\nas Cleland’s “Woman of Pleasure” (“Letters,” edition Leitzmann and\r\nSchüddekopf, vol. ii., p. 187) and “Lyndamine,” etc. Talented women of\r\nthat period also read pornographic works. Pauline Wiesel, the beloved of\r\nPrince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia, greatly admired Mirabeau’s obscene\r\nwritings, as we learn from a letter of Friedrich Gentz, in which the\r\nlatter decries them as “cold libertinage,” and recommends to his friend\r\nsimilar products of Voltaire, Crébillon, and Grécourt.[787]\r\n\r\nThese facts do not excuse pornography, but they refute the assertion\r\nthat pornography and true artistic perception are incompatible. As\r\nSchopenhauer truly says, many contrasts can exist side by side in the\r\nsame human being. This is even more clearly manifest in pictorial art.\r\nAnyone who turns over the leaves of Eduard Fuchs’ book upon the erotic\r\nelement in caricature will learn that the greatest painters have\r\noccasionally painted deliberately =improper, obscene= pictures. I need\r\nmention only the names of Lucas Cranach, Annibale Carracci, H. S. Beham,\r\nRembrandt, G. Aldegrever, Adrian van Ostade, Watteau, Boucher,\r\nFragonard, Vivan-Denon, Gillray, Lawrence, Rowlandson, Heinrich Ramberg,\r\nWilhelm von Kaulbach, Schadow, Otto Greiner, Willette, Kubin, Julius\r\nPascin,[788] Beardsley, etc.[789]\r\n\r\nSide by side with these higher pornographic works there exists also a\r\nlower kind--obscene garbage writings and pornographic pictures of the\r\nworst possible kind, such as picture postcards, “act-photographs,” etc.,\r\nin which all possible sexual perversities are represented, either in\r\nprinted matter or by pictures (masturbation, _poses lubriques_,\r\nrepresentations of nude portions of the body, copralagnistic and\r\nurolagnistic acts, bestiality, sadism, masochism, pæderasty, incest,\r\nfornicatory acts with children, orgies, obscene paraphrases of proverbs,\r\nrape, etc.). Kemmer (_op. cit._, pp. 31-45) gives a detailed account of\r\nthe sale of these obscenities, and of the way in which they are\r\nadvertised in catalogues, etc. They are manufactured in France, Germany,\r\nBelgium, and Spain (especially in Barcelona). The dangerous character of\r\nthese articles is indisputable; they have a suggestive influence, and\r\nstimulate those who look at them to imitative acts. They may thus\r\ndirectly give rise to sexual perversities.[790] But they are not so\r\ndangerous as the true =hawkers’ literature=[791] and =popular garbage\r\nwritings= about “secret sins.” These inflame the imagination, and thus\r\nlead to crime and sexual infamies. This is an old experience. In the\r\nyear 1901, at the trial of the boy murderers Thärigen and Kroft\r\n(_Vossische Zeitung_, No. 161, April 5, 1901), the two murderers\r\nconfessed that they had been incited to the commission of crime by\r\nbackstairs romances, and by tales of Indians and robbers. The same cause\r\nwas alleged, in December, 1906, in Kottbus, by a boy fourteen years of\r\nage, who was accused of murder.\r\n\r\nHow are we to counteract the moral harm done by such literature? I\r\nconsider all the efforts of societies for the suppression of immorality\r\nto be illusory and two-edged, for they =always fail= to attain their\r\nend; and in addition, unfortunately--a matter of which there is no\r\ndoubt--they endanger the freedom of art and science.[792] All measures\r\ncalculated to keep away from children and immature persons books which\r\nmight serve to give rise to sexual stimulation are worthy of support;\r\nand it must be remembered that =for children and immature persons\r\nscientific books, religious writings--as, for example, the unexpurgated\r\nBible--and also illustrated comic papers, etc., may be dangerous=. But,\r\nfor the most part, all prohibitions, and the whole campaign against\r\nimmorality, =serve only to favour pornography=. The stricter the\r\nmeasures taken against it, =the wider becomes its diffusion=. This is a\r\n=very old experience=, an incontrovertible fact. Tacitus (“Ann.,” XIV.,\r\nc. 50) rightly explained this peculiar phenomenon: “_Libros exuri\r\njussit_, =conquisitos lectitatosque, donec cum periculo parabantur=:\r\n_mox licentia habendi oblivionem attulit_” (“He issued a decree that the\r\nbooks were to be burned; =but as long as it was dangerous to publish\r\nthem they were in great request, and were eagerly read=: whereas as soon\r\nas people were permitted to possess them they passed into oblivion”).\r\nThe pornographic books which during the last five hundred years have\r\nbeen burned by the public executioner, which have been confiscated, and\r\nwhich have been repeatedly destroyed to the last copy, the obscene\r\nengravings of which the plates have been destroyed--have all these\r\ndisappeared from the surface of the earth, have all these confiscations\r\nand condemnations[793] of _livres défendus_ been of any use whatever?\r\nNo. All the pornographic writings, confiscated and destroyed a thousand\r\ntimes over, =reappear again and again=; indeed, they become more\r\nnumerous the more the attempt is made to suppress them. The campaign\r\nagainst them has always been a campaign against a hydra, a labour of the\r\nDanaïdes, which has no object, and only entails the disadvantage that,\r\nin the general zeal to put an end to immoral literature, scientific and\r\nartistic interests are most seriously endangered. Happily, this campaign\r\nis to-day less vigorous than it was of yore. In proportion to the\r\npopulation, immoral literature in Germany was before 1870 far more\r\nwidely diffused than it is at the present day. During the sixth and\r\nseventh decades of the nineteenth century it flourished more\r\nluxuriantly; even during the time of the war of liberation numerous\r\noriginal obscene books were printed in Germany. To-day the interest in\r\nsocial, scientific, technical, and philosophic questions, and in sport,\r\nhas become so great, and the interest in sexual questions has become so\r\nmuch =more profound=, that an overgrowth of pornography is no longer to\r\nbe feared. From these facts we recognize at once =the only way=, and\r\n=the right way=, which we must follow in order to paralyze the evil\r\ninfluences of pornography. This is to take a proper care for =genuine\r\npopular culture, to increase educational opportunities=, and to =reduce\r\nthe price of books=. A single undertaking such as that of A. Reimann,\r\nwho, in his _Deutsche Bücherei_, publishes for threepence a volume a\r\ncollection of choice literature, containing not only the best fiction,\r\nbut also popularly written scientific works from the pens of leading men\r\nof science and essayists--such an enterprise is far more effective in\r\nthe suppression of garbage literature than all the Unions for the\r\nPromotion of Morality.\r\n\r\n  SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE TO CHAPTER XXX.--In connexion with the questions\r\n  discussed in this chapter, the reader may profitably consult the\r\n  recently published book of Willy Schindler (written, however, from an\r\n  unduly subjective standpoint), “The Erotic Element in Literature and\r\n  Art” (Berlin, 1907).\r\n\r\n  [English readers interested in the question of the dangers of\r\n  pornographic literature and art in relation to that “liberty of\r\n  unlicensed printing” which is so essential to the welfare of the\r\n  modern social democratic State, should read the thoughtful and\r\n  luminous discussion of the topic by H. G. Wells, in one of the later\r\n  chapters of his admirable “Mankind in the Making.”--TRANSLATOR.]\r\n\r\n  [776] Johannes David Schreber (of Meissen), “De libris obscoenis”\r\n  (Leipzig, 1688, quarto).\r\n\r\n  [777] _Cf._ Iwan Bloch, “The Lex Heinze and Medical Authorship,”\r\n  published in _Die Medizinsche Woche_, No. 9, March 12, 1900.\r\n\r\n  [778] _Cf._, regarding this matter, the _Aerztlicher\r\n  Zentral-Anzeiger_, No. 24, June 10, 1901.\r\n\r\n  [779] Unfortunately, I was mistaken in this optimistic assumption. In\r\n  the _Journal of the German Book Trade_, No. 77, April 3, 1906, I find\r\n  among the list of confiscated works “Means for the Prevention of\r\n  Conception”--a separate impression of the _Deutsche Medizinische\r\n  Presse_, Berlin, No. 7, April 5, 1899. By the decision of one of the\r\n  Berlin courts the further issue of this work, and the further use of\r\n  the stereotype forms from which it was printed, were forbidden.\r\n\r\n  [780] Eduard Fuchs, “The Erotic Element in Caricature,” p. 10 (Berlin,\r\n  1904), _Cf._ also Paul Leppin, “The Ludicrous in the Erotic,”\r\n  published in _Das Blaubuch_, edited by Ilgenstein and Kalthoff, No 4,\r\n  February 1, 1906, pp. 149-155.\r\n\r\n  [781] John Milton’s “Areopagitica.”\r\n\r\n  [782] An exception must be made of the work of Aretino, which in the\r\n  Italian original is extremely difficult to understand. I, therefore,\r\n  regard the masterly translation published by the Insel-Verlag as a\r\n  justifiable undertaking.\r\n\r\n  [783] To those desirous of obtaining information regarding modern\r\n  pornography, I can recommend, above all, the work of Ludwig Kemmer,\r\n  based upon official material, “Die graphische Reklame der\r\n  Prostitution,” Munich, 1906. _Cf._ also Heinrich Stümcke, “The Immoral\r\n  Literature of the Present Day,” published in “_Zwischen den Garben_,”\r\n  pp. 100-107 (Leipzig, 1899); same author, “Literary Sins and Affairs\r\n  of the Heart,” pp. 30-34 (Berlin, 1894); Sebastian Brant,\r\n  “Prostitution as displayed in the Great Art Exhibition of Berlin,\r\n  1895” (second edition, Berlin, 1895).

Hirth, “Ways to Love,” p. 352. This fact has been\r\n  confirmed to me by Herr F. von Biedermann. When Frauenstädt once said\r\n  to Schopenhauer that Goethe, when away from the Court, gladly made use\r\n  of coarse expressions, Schopenhauer replied: “Yes, many contrasts can\r\n  exist side by side in the same human being,” and he confirmed the fact\r\n  from his own experience that Goethe was fond of gross phrases. _Cf._\r\n  Sohopenhauer’s “Gespräche und Selbstgespräche,” edited by E.\r\n  Grisebach, p. 40 (Berlin, 1902).

It is a fable to say that sexual matters have =to-day\r\nfor the first time= been freely discussed in belletristic literature, to\r\nassert that the predominance of erotic literature (which is to be\r\ndistinguished from pornographic literature by its artistic intention and\r\nform) is especially characteristic of modern civilization. A glance at\r\nthe catalogue of the library of the poet and bibliophile Eduard\r\nGrisebach,[794] which contains the erotic literature of the world,\r\nteaches us that such literature has existed at all times and among all\r\ncivilized nations. The erotic in belles-lettres has not merely a\r\npermissive existence, but by necessity forms a part of it--a fact very\r\njustly recognized by the æsthetic Konrad Lange.[795] Who that knows\r\nhuman nature can doubt the fact? Lange remarks:\r\n\r\n  “Art which represents the nude, because an opportunity exists for it\r\n  to delight in the representation of the flesh, because it regards\r\n  humanity as the crown of creation, and because it admires the\r\n  purposive anatomical structure of the human body--such an art is\r\n  =within its own rights=, and does what it =may= and =must=.\r\n\r\n  “If we regard the representation of the nude in painting and sculpture\r\n  as not repulsive, although it does not suit us in ordinary life to go\r\n  naked, =so also in the poesy of the erotic we must sometimes allow a\r\n  form to which in ordinary life a justification is refused=. Indeed,\r\n  the question arises whether it is not absolutely =essential= that art\r\n  should represent the erotic, although this is forbidden by the\r\n  civilization of our time; for this corresponds to a profound\r\n  subjective human need, a yearning for the completion of man’s\r\n  imperfect existence.\r\n\r\n  “Next to hunger and thirst, love is the strongest human emotion; next\r\n  to death, its enjoyment is the most important human experience. It is\r\n  not to be wondered at that art is especially fond of depicting it. Art\r\n  which wishes to represent life in general cannot leave unconsidered an\r\n  instinct which plays so important a part in the life of the majority\r\n  of human beings, and from which such a number of conflicts proceed.\r\n  With regard to the degree and the kind of representation, =the\r\n  decision depends not upon moral, but exclusively upon æsthetic,\r\n  considerations=. The task of the poet is no more than this: to\r\n  describe transgressions of the moral code in such a manner that they\r\n  appear to arise by an inner necessity out of the whole course of\r\n  activity, out of the characters, out of the objective relationships.\r\n  Then the immoral content comes to the help of the illusion.”\r\n\r\nIt is naturally impossible, within the narrow compass of this work, to\r\ngive an exhaustive account of the sexual element in modern belletristic\r\nliterature. I shall only refer to a few well-known phenomena which all\r\nexhibit a common feature. Love and sexual topics in belles-lettres are\r\nprincipally =problem= literature. The earnest and profound social\r\nperception with which sexual problems are to-day considered and\r\nexplained is reflected also in the literature of our time. The adult\r\nwill long ago in these matters have risen above the level of shallow\r\nstory-telling and schoolgirl morality, and demands an earnest and honest\r\nrepresentation of sexual problems. Frey[796] justly observes that it is\r\na general and a healthy tendency of the time, not a tendency to perverse\r\nlust, which impels the choice of erotic material. In the economically\r\ndetermined forced labour of persons of average ability, in the monotony\r\nand the poverty of adventure of our civilized life, it is only by\r\neroticism that into many a life any individual colouring is brought.\r\n\r\nIn the following brief sketch of the sexual problems treated in recent\r\nbelletristic literature, I hope to give some idea of the =very numerous=\r\nand interesting topics which the various phenomena of the sexual life\r\nnow offer to the poet.\r\n\r\nThe very =first= sexual activities of the child have been subjected to\r\npoetic treatment, as in Frank Wedekind’s drama, “Frühlingserwachen”\r\n(“The Awakening of Spring”); and the sexual note of the time of puberty\r\nis treated in Bonnetain’s celebrated onanistic novel, “Charlot s’Amuse,”\r\nin Walter Bloem’s novel, “Der krasse Fuchs,” in Max von Münchhausen’s\r\n“Eckhart von Jeperen,” and very strikingly in the novel “Lothar oder\r\nUntergang einer Kindheit” (“Lothar, or the Ruin of Childhood”), by Oscar\r\nA. H. Schmitz. In connexion with the consideration of the time of\r\npuberty in belletristic literature, the following works may also be\r\nmentioned: “Unterm Rad,” by Hermann Hesse; “Freund Hein,” by Emil\r\nStrauss; “Die Verwirrungen des Zöglings Törless,” by Robert Musil; “Was\r\nzur Sonne Will,” by Hans Hart; “Eine Gymnasiastentragödie,” a drama in\r\nfour acts, by Robert Sandeks. Consult also Gustav Zieler’s review of\r\n“Frühlingserwachen,” published in _Das Literarische Echo_ of August 15,\r\n1907.\r\n\r\nThe type of girl who ripens to a premature sexuality, and who, though\r\nphysically still intact, is spiritually corrupt, has been made widely\r\nknown by Marcel Prévost’s “Demivierge.” A companion novel to this is\r\n“Nixchen,” by Hans von Kahlenberg. Nobler types of girls playing with\r\nthis vice are described by Clara Eysell-Kilburger in “Dilettanten des\r\nLasters.”\r\n\r\nDiametrically opposed to these are the “Vera” characters, so called\r\nafter the book by Vera, “Eine für Viele. Aus dem Tagebuche eines\r\nMädchens” (“One for Many. From the Diary of a Girl”), which demands from\r\nthe man before marriage the same purity and chastity that man himself\r\ndemands from his future wife. Svava, in Björnsen’s drama “Der\r\nHandschuh,” is a similar type. Regarding this problem an entire\r\nliterature has sprung into being, which associated itself with Vera’s\r\nabove-mentioned book, such as “Eine für sich Selbst” (“One for\r\nHerself”), by “Auch Jemand” (“Somebody Else”); “Einer für Viele” (“One\r\nMan for Many”); “Eine für Vera. Aus dem Tagebuche einer jungen Frau”\r\n(“One for Vera. From the Diary of a Young Wife”)--these in favour of\r\nVera’s demand--and Christine Thaler’s “Eine Mutter für Viele” (“One\r\nMother for Many”); by Verus, “Einer für Viele” (“One Man for Many”), and\r\n“Kranke Seelen. Von einem Arzte” (“Morbid Souls. By a Physician”)--these\r\nin opposition to Vera’s demand--for masculine abstinence from sexual\r\nintercourse before marriage.[797]\r\n\r\nNext we may mention certain novels glorifying =misogyny=, such as\r\nStrindberg’s “Beichte eines Toren” (“Confessions of a Fool”) and\r\n“Vergangenheit eines Toren” (“The Past of a Fool”); and Tolstoi’s “The\r\nKreutzer Sonata,” in which absolute asceticism is demanded. These ideas,\r\nwhich in Weininger found a pseudo-scientific apologist, have been\r\ncontested in an interesting autobiography in the form of a romance, “Das\r\nWeib vom Manne erschaffen: Bekenntnisse einer Frau” (“Woman created from\r\nMan: Confessions of a Woman”), translated from the Norwegian by Tyra\r\nBentsen. Zola’s magnificent hymn in favour of fruitfulness in\r\n“Fécondité” is also a refutation of this extreme ascetic-malthusian\r\nstandpoint.\r\n\r\nThe “intimacy” and “free love” are to-day the subject of innumerable\r\nromances and novels. Tovote discusses the problem in “Im Liebesrausch”\r\n(“In the Intoxication of Love”), and in other novels, more superficially\r\nfrom the grossly sensual side; the ideal free love, ending indeed in\r\nmarriage, is described in Peter Nansen’s “Maria.”[798] Similarly,\r\nFrenssen, in “Hilligenlei,” deals with the preconjugal sexual\r\nintercourse so common in country districts, and he reproves in powerful\r\nwords the repression of natural impulses by conventional morality.[799]\r\n\r\nIn “Martin Birks Jugend,” Hjalmar Söderberg has described the great\r\ndifficulties of ideal-minded young men who are not in a position to\r\nmarry, and who are repelled by the idea of intercourse with common\r\nprostitutes.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to this, Camille Lemonnier, in “Die Liebe im Menschen,”\r\ndescribes the great danger of an =overgrowth= of the sexual; and Arthur\r\nSchnitzler, in his admirable “Reigen,” describes the utter misery of\r\n=irregular sexual intercourse=, of true “wild love,” and displays\r\nvividly before our eyes the results of sexual promiscuity.\r\n\r\nThe social contempt and the other disastrous consequences which to-day\r\nfollow free love, in the form of =illegitimate motherhood=, have been\r\ndescribed in dramas, such as Sudermann’s “Heimat” and Gerhart\r\nHauptmann’s “Rose Bernd,” and in romances such as Gabriele Reuter’s “Aus\r\nguter Familie,” Johann Bojer’s “Eine Pilgerfahrt,” and Ernst\r\nEberhardt’s “Das Kind.” The manifold conflicts resulting from free love\r\nand illegitimate motherhood are also described by Marcelle Tinayre in\r\n“La Rebelle.”\r\n\r\nIn belles-lettres we also find numerous accounts of the burning question\r\nof our day--that of =coercive marriage=. Above all, Ibsen, in “Ghosts,”\r\n“A Doll’s House,” “The Lady from the Sea,” “Hedda Gabler,” and “Little\r\nEyolf,” has exposed the manifold injuries resulting from modern\r\nconventional marriage, and has propounded the ideal of a new marriage,\r\nbased upon a deeply subjective conception of love and upon life’s work\r\nin common. The influence of Ibsen is further shown in numerous dramas\r\nand romances dealing with the marriage problem. Of these, it will\r\nsuffice to mention a few of the most successful, such as “Die Sklavin,”\r\nby Ludwig Fulda; “Fanny Roth: eine Jungfrauengeschichte,” by Grete\r\nMeisel-Hess; and “Was siehst du aber den Splitter,” by Karl Larsen.\r\n\r\nThe important question of differences in class and social position in\r\nmarried life is considered by Ernst von Wildenbruch in his drama, “Die\r\nHaubenlerche.”\r\n\r\nThe classical novels of adultery are, and will remain, Erneste Feydeau’s\r\ndelightful “Fanny,” and Gustave Flaubert’s “Madame Bovary.” In French\r\nliterature in general, in dramas as well as romances, adultery is a\r\nfavourite motive.[800]\r\n\r\nIsolated but especially characteristic phenomena of the sexual life have\r\nalso found expression in poetry. Thus Ernst von Wolzogen, in “Das Dritte\r\nGeschlect,” describes the various types of =emancipated women=; the same\r\nquestion forms the theme of “Die Neue Eva,” by Maria Janitschek. Anna\r\nMahr, also, in Gerhart Hauptmann’s “Einsame Menschen,” is such a type.\r\nIn all of these the conflict between woman and personality is described;\r\nand this is done with exceptional force and clearness in “Das Neue\r\nWeib,” by M. Janitschek.[801]\r\n\r\nThe contrast to the woman who wishes to become a personality is to be\r\nfound in the woman who has never possessed a personality, or who has\r\nlost it, the woman who has become only a chattel, an object of enjoyment\r\nfor man--=the prostitute=. I alluded before (p. 315) to the fact that\r\nMargarete Böhme, in her sensational “Diary of a Lost Woman,” was not the\r\nfirst to describe the life of a prostitute. Already from the sixteenth\r\ncentury there date such romances as, for example, the celebrated “Lozana\r\nAndaluza” of Francisco Delgado; also Defoe’s “History of Moll Flanders,”\r\nand Abbé Prévost’s “Manon Lescaut” (both belonging to the eighteenth\r\ncentury). Besides the “Memoirs of a Hamburg Prostitute” (_vide supra_,\r\np. 315), there exist still other precursors, belonging to the nineteenth\r\ncentury, of the “Diary of a Lost Woman,” such as E. de Goncourt’s “Fille\r\nElisa,” Leon Leipsiger’s “Ballhaus-Anna,” etc. The “Diary of a Lost\r\nWoman” naturally soon found imitations, such as Hedwig Hard’s\r\n“Confessions of a Fallen Woman,” the “Diary of Another Lost Woman”; and\r\nthe purely pornographic “History of Josephine Mutzenbecher, a Viennese\r\nProstitute,” Daudet’s “Sapho,” Zola’s “Nana,” Cristian Krogh’s\r\n“Albertine,” and George Moore’s “Esther Waters,” belong to the same\r\nclass.[802]\r\n\r\n=Brothel life= and the =life of prostitution=, in all their\r\nrelationships to modern civilization, and in their influence upon human\r\ncharacter, are described by Frank Wedekind in “Die Büchse der Pandora”\r\n(“Pandora’s Box”) and in his “Hidalla”; and with exceptional vividness\r\nby Oscar Metenier, in his romance cycle, extending to seven volumes,\r\n“Tartufes et Satyres.”\r\n\r\nThe rôle of =alcohol= and of =syphilis= in the sexual life have also\r\nbeen discussed in belletristic literature. In Gerhart Hauptmann’s “Vor\r\nSonnenaufgang” (“Before Sunrise”), Loth abandons his beloved Helne as\r\nsoon as he learns that she springs from a degenerate family of\r\ndrunkards. The disastrous consequences of syphilis are described by\r\nIbsen in “Ghosts,” and recently most vividly by Brieux in “Les\r\nAvariés.”[803]\r\n\r\nExtraordinarily comprehensive, especially in France, is the belletristic\r\nliterature of =sexual perversities=. After the manner of the\r\n“Rougon-Macquart” series by Zola, Jean Larocque has written a romance\r\ncycle of eleven volumes, under the general title of “Les Voluptueuses”\r\n(the separate titles are: “Isey,” “Viviane,” “Odile,” “Fausta,”\r\n“Daphne,” “Phœbe,” “Fusette,” “La Naïade,” “Louvette,” “Lucine,” and\r\n“Hémine”; in the last volume we find even a discussion of copralagnistic\r\ndetails!). Some volumes of this series--for example, “Phœbe”--have even\r\nbeen translated into English. The works also of Baudelaire, Verlaine,\r\nand Guy de Maupassant, offer a rich material for the study of\r\npsychopathia sexualis. In this connexion I may also mention the poetic\r\ncollections “La Légende des Sexes,” by Edmond Haraucourt; “Rimes de\r\nJoie,” by Théodore Hannon; and also the “Chants de Maldoror.” Octave\r\nMirbeau also, in his “Journal d’une Femme de Chambre,” provides us with\r\na review of the entire register of sexual perversities.[804] He, and\r\nalso the talented Rachilde (who in her romances “Monsieur Venus,” “Les\r\nHors Nature,” and “Madame Adonis,” considers the question of\r\nhomosexuality), never fail to exhibit the artistic spirit in their\r\ndescriptions of these delicate topics--and, indeed, _l’art pour l’art_\r\ndoctrine seems to have been created especially in relation to this\r\ndepartment of thought.\r\n\r\n=Homosexuality= and =bisexuality= have been considered in such a large\r\nnumber of works that it is quite impossible to mention them all here. A\r\nfairly complete bibliography of these will be found in the volumes of\r\nthe _Annual for Sexual Intermediate Stages_.[805] I can allude here only\r\nto a few especially well-known and artistically important homosexual\r\nromances and poems. Jouy, in his admirable “Galerie des Femmes” (Paris,\r\n1799), devotes to the “Lesbiennes” a special chapter; Théophile Gautier,\r\nin “Mademoiselle de Maupin,” discusses the interesting problem of\r\nbisexuality; Zola, in “Nana,” represents the Lesbian relationship; Paul\r\nVerlaine in 1867 published tribadistic poetry under the title of “Les\r\nAmis.”[806] Since that time Englishmen, Germans, Belgians, and Italians\r\nhave published belletristic descriptions of homosexual relationships. I\r\nmay allude to Oscar Wilde’s “Dorian Grey,” Georges Eekhoud’s\r\n“Escal-Vigor,” Walt Whitman’s “Leaves of Grass,” Prime-Stevenson’s\r\n“Irenæus,” Louis d’Herdy’s “L’Homme-Sirene,” F. G. Pernauhm’s “Ercole\r\nTomei,” “Die Infamen,” and “Der junge Kurt”; also the sensational\r\n“Idylle Sapphique” of the demi-mondaine Liane de Pougy, the epic\r\n“Ganymedes” of C. W. Geissler, and the drama “Jasminblüte” of Dilsner.\r\n\r\nMasochism found its introduction to belles-lettres by the writer from\r\nwhom the very name is derived, L. von Sacher-Masoch, more especially in\r\n“Vermächtnis Kains.” Of his novels, the best known is “Venus im Pelz”;\r\nothers are “Galizischen Geschichten,” “Messalinen Wiens,” “Die schwarze\r\nZarin,” and “Wiener Hofgeschichten.” He still remains the only writer\r\nwho has treated this peculiar perversity in an artistic manner. The more\r\nrecent masochistic and sadistic novels belong to the worst kind of\r\nhawker’s literature. Lou Andreas-Salomé only, in “Eine Ausschweifung,”\r\nhas artistically described the spiritual masochism of a woman with the\r\nfine psychological characterization peculiar to her work.\r\n\r\nQuite recently there has actually appeared a masochistic monthly\r\nmagazine, entitled _Geissel und Rute: Archiv für Erziehung_ [_sic!_]\r\n_Erwachsener_ (_Whip and Rod: Archives for the Education_ [_sic!_] _of\r\nAdults_), edited by C. vom Stein, Buda-Pesth. The first number appeared\r\non February 1, 1907. It contains masochistic stories, correspondence,\r\nhistorical sketches, and advertisements.\r\n\r\nSadistic love is the theme of Oscar Wilde’s “Salome,” and of the\r\n“Diaboliques” of Barbey d’Aurevilly. The satanic element is dealt with\r\nin Huysmans’ “La Bas,” and in various novels by St. Przybyszewski.\r\nHerbert Eulenburg’s drama “Ritter Blaubart” also represents a sadistic\r\ntype.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I may allude to some authors who represent to us the\r\nwhole psychology of modern love, and, above all, the depths of the love\r\nof reflection, its spiritual refinement, all the manifold moods,\r\nillusions, and dreams of the modern eros. J. P. Jakobsen’s “Niels\r\nLyhne,” Hans Jäger’s “Christiania-Bohême,” Oskar Mysing’s “Grosse\r\nLeidenschaft,” Heinrich Mann’s “Jagd nach Liebe,” Gabriele d’Annunzio’s\r\n“Il Piacere,” “Trionfo della Morte,” and “Fuoco,” represent aspects of\r\nlove. With the profoundest art, Lou Andreas-Salomé, in her\r\nstories--which in this respect I regard as among the most valuable\r\nproducts of modern literature--“Ruth,” “Fenitschka,” “Ma,” and\r\n“Menschenkinder,” represents the finer spiritual relationships between\r\nman and woman. This writer appears to possess the most intimate\r\nknowledge of the soul of the modern woman. Elisabeth Dauthendey, also\r\n(“Vom neuen Weibe und seiner Liebe”), Gabriele Reuter (“Liselotte von\r\nReckling,” “Ellen von der Weiden”), and Rosa Mayreder (“Idole”), give\r\nmost powerful descriptions of complicated feminine characters.[807] An\r\nimportant and interesting topic is discussed by Yvette Guilbert in “Les\r\nDemivieilles”--the psychology of the woman beginning to grow old, who\r\ncannot yet renounce love and yet is forced to do so by rude reality.\r\n\r\nThe writings to which I have referred in this chapter--the number of\r\nwhich could easily be increased tenfold without exhausting the abundance\r\nof recent belletristic literature occupied in the discussion of the\r\nsexual problem--should suffice to give some idea of how great is the\r\ninterest in the important problems of the sexual life, how detailed and\r\ncomplicated the problems of that life have become under the influence of\r\nmodern civilization, and with what earnestness they are treated in the\r\nbelles-lettres of the day. The light and frivolous mood of Wieland and\r\nClauren is no longer found to-day. In its place we have grandiose moral\r\ndescription, a more =dramatic= treatment of sexual problems, an\r\nunsparing exposure of the gloomier aspects of amatory life, and a\r\npsychological penetration into all the activities of the loving soul.\r\nRegarded =as a whole=, love in modern belletristic literature is treated\r\nfrom far worthier and higher standpoints than formerly. =There is no\r\nground whatever for regarding the widespread discussion of sexual\r\nproblems in modern literature as a stigma of degeneration.= In this\r\nrespect our literature is merely a mirror of our time; and its\r\ntendencies indicate very clearly the emergence of a new, earnest, and\r\nmore profound conception of the sexual relations between man and\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\n  [794] Eduard Grisebach, “Catalogue of World Literature, with Literary\r\n  and Bibliographical Annotations” (second edition, Berlin, 1905).\r\n\r\n  [795] K. Lange, “The Nature of Art,” vol. ii., pp. 161-177 (Berlin,\r\n  1901).\r\n\r\n  [796] Philipp Frey, “The Battle of the Sexes,” pp. 33, 34 (Vienna,\r\n  1904).\r\n\r\n  [797] Reference has previously been made (p. 673) to an English novel\r\n  similar in character to Vera’s book--viz., “The Heavenly Twins,” by\r\n  Sarah Grand. But the classical English example of a novel devoted to\r\n  the consideration of the differing standards by which preconjugal\r\n  sexual intercourse is judged in man and in woman respectively is “Tess\r\n  of the D’Urbervilles,” by Thomas Hardy.\r\n\r\n  [798] In “The Woman who Did,” by Grant Allen, we have an English novel\r\n  advocating free love; like “Eine für Viele,” this evoked a number of\r\n  novels with allied titles, such as “The Woman who Didn’t,” “The Woman\r\n  who Wouldn’t,” and the like. A far profounder study of a free union\r\n  between a man whose wife refused to divorce him (on “moral” grounds)\r\n  and another woman is George Meredith’s “One of Our Conquerors.” In\r\n  “Jude the Obscure,” by Thomas Hardy, we have another detailed\r\n  consideration of the difficulties attendant on a free union in a\r\n  society under the dominion of Philistine morality. A recent novel in\r\n  which freer sexual relationships are discussed from a somewhat ideal\r\n  standpoint is “In the Days of the Comet,” by H. G. Wells. (In the\r\n  character of Sue Bridehead, in “Jude the Obscure,” we have a\r\n  remarkable study of the “frigid” type of woman. I have before alluded,\r\n  in a note to p. 435, to a recent novel by Hubert Wales, “Mr. and Mrs.\r\n  Villiers,” devoted to the question of sexual frigidity in\r\n  woman.)--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n  [799] “Bourgeois morality is the arch-murderer, which murders your\r\n  youth and the youth of many of your sisters. If we lived in natural\r\n  conditions, you would always, from the days of your childhood, be\r\n  surrounded by young persons of the other sex. One of these would have\r\n  contracted a friendship for you; another would have honoured you from\r\n  a distance; with a third you would have played joyfully. But from your\r\n  twentieth year onwards, three or four or more of them would have\r\n  ardently wooed you, because you are strong and beautiful and chaste.\r\n  And so with tears, and passion, and suffering, with games and kisses,\r\n  you would have gladly become a woman; thus it is even yet among the\r\n  children of manual labourers. A beautiful, chaste, diligent workman’s\r\n  child has wooers enough. But among the so-called cultured people,\r\n  morality has distorted and destroyed all the beauty of nature....\r\n  Where the middle-class youth goes to and fro, there goes also, like an\r\n  old youth-hating aunt, morality, and destroys for each poor girl the\r\n  best time of her life; and many never come to marriage, and many come\r\n  too late.”\r\n\r\n  [800] In “Divorçons,” a comedy by V. Sardou and E. de Najac, we have\r\n  an exceedingly witty, though trivial, treatment of the idea of a\r\n  terminable marriage contract.--TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n  [801] An early example of the “emancipated woman” in English\r\n  literature is to be found in Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s “Aurora\r\n  Leigh.” This conception of feminine character aroused the usual\r\n  hostility in minds working along the older grooves, so that Edward\r\n  Fitzgerald, when Mrs. Browning died, is said to have exclaimed: “Thank\r\n  God!

VON SCHRENCK-NOTZING.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS OF CHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n  Indispensable need for the scientific investigation of sexual problems\r\n  -- Insignificance and ludicrous character of the objections made to\r\n  such investigation -- The diffusion of sexual perversities was just as\r\n  extensive before their scientific study was first undertaken -- de\r\n  Sade’s system of psychopathia sexualis -- Recent additions to the\r\n  scientific literature of the subject -- Works upon homosexuality --\r\n  Upon erotic symbolism -- General investigations regarding the sexual\r\n  impulse -- General works upon the sexual problem -- Periodical\r\n  literature relating to the sexual life.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nTruth is always a good thing, even truth regarding the sexual life.\r\nNeither prudery nor moral hypocrisy can controvert this proposition. He\r\nwho recognizes the immense importance of sexuality in relationship to\r\ncivilization at large--he who, like the author of the present work, has\r\nbeen occupied for many years in the study of the subject from the points\r\nof view of medicine, anthropology, ethnology, literature, and the\r\nhistory of civilization--is not only entitled, but will also consider it\r\nhis duty, to publish his investigations, to make publicly known his\r\nviews and his opinions, and to take a definite and clear position in\r\nrelation to the burning questions of the day in this province of\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nSuch men as Ploss-Bartels, who, in their celebrated and purely\r\nscientific work, “Woman in Natural History and Folklore,” could not\r\navoid collecting numerous piquant and even obscene details, and who, for\r\nexample, have described in a special chapter the various postures\r\nassumed during sexual intercourse; such a man as von Krafft-Ebing, whose\r\n“Psychopathia Sexualis”[808] contains a number of detailed\r\nautobiographies and clinical histories of sexually perverse\r\nindividuals--such men as these have been blamed because their books have\r\nbeen diffused in numerous editions, extending to many thousands of\r\ncopies, and because these books have been read more by laymen than by\r\nmedical men. Apart from the fact that in earlier times much more\r\ndangerous books--such, for example, as the works of Virey, Flittner, G.\r\nF. Most, and Rozier, characterized by a lascivious style, or such a book\r\nas the dictionary “Eros”--obtained the widest possible circulation;\r\napart, also from the fact that even in works conceived and executed in a\r\nstrictly scientific spirit--such as the numerous monographs of Martin\r\nSchurig, or the work of Frenzel (belonging to the nineteenth century)\r\nconcerning impotence (see, for example, Frenzel, _op. cit._, pp. 155,\r\n156, 161)--obscene passages and incredibly depraved stories occur; and\r\napart, finally, from the incredible mass of pornographic writings, in\r\ncomparison with which the scientific literature of the sexual life is\r\nalmost infinitesimally small--putting on one side all these\r\nconsiderations, it is merely necessary to refer to the =established\r\nfact= that all possible sexual perversities were known to exist before\r\nthe publication of von Krafft-Ebing’s “Psychopathia Sexualis,” and that\r\nthey made their appearance spontaneously at all times and in all places.\r\nIn the eighteenth century the Marquis de Sade, in his romance “The One\r\nHundred and Twenty Days of Sodom,” was able to found a system of\r\npsychopathia sexualis which not only contained =all= the perverse types\r\ndescribed by von Krafft-Ebing, but was even more varied in its contents,\r\nand exhibited yet more numerous categories of sexual anomalies than the\r\nbook of the Viennese alienist.[809] This work is a document of enormous\r\nimportance to civilization,[810] because it provides a complete\r\nrefutation to the fable of modern degeneration, and because it gives us\r\na proof that =quite shortly= before the powerful upheaval of the French\r\nnation and the heroic campaigns of the Napoleonic epoch, in this nation\r\nthere were diffused the most frightful perversities, regarding the\r\nreality of which there can, according to recent experience, be no doubt\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nScientific authorship--even popular scientific works[811]--dealing with\r\nthe province of the sexual life cannot therefore be made responsible, in\r\nany respect, for the diffusion of sexual perversities. The founder of\r\nmodern sexual science, A. von Schrenck-Notzing,[812] insisted on this\r\nfact; and recently it has been once more emphasized by S. Freud, who has\r\nprobably gone further than any other writer in biologico-physiological\r\nderivation of sexual perversions.\r\n\r\nHavelock Ellis’s “Analysis of the Sexual Impulse” (vol. iii. of this\r\nwriter’s “Studies in the Psychology of Sex,” published by the F. A.\r\nDavis Co., Philadelphia)--a book in which we find an admirable analysis\r\nof the development and variations of the sexual impulse, including an\r\naccount of sadism and masochism, enriched by numerous examples--has\r\nrecently appeared in a German translation (Würzburg, 1903). The\r\ntranslator, Dr. H. Kurella, in his preface to this work, says (pp. ix,\r\nx), in my opinion with perfect justice:\r\n\r\n  “Daily experience among my patients suffering from nervous\r\n  diseases--patients who were for the most part women and girls--has\r\n  shown me how extremely important is enlightenment regarding the sexual\r\n  life for women suffering from nervous disorders. =For this reason, I\r\n  hope the book will have the widest possible circulation among the\r\n  mothers of daughters about to grow up.= If they will employ in a\r\n  proper manner the knowledge which they will be able to obtain from its\r\n  contents, in this way an immeasurable quantity of sorrow and misery\r\n  can be prevented. This use of its teaching will, by itself, suffice to\r\n  compensate the author and the translator for the scruples they must\r\n  always feel in giving to the world a book which is likely to be valued\r\n  by some simply as providing prurient reading matter, and which by such\r\n  persons will perhaps be circulated for this purpose--a fate to which\r\n  every book dealing with erotic subjects is exposed, however earnest\r\n  its style and tendency may be.”\r\n\r\nThe lively scientific activity which now animates the department of\r\nsexual problems is a matter for rejoicing, since it indicates the\r\nadvance of knowledge in one of the most important of all vital problems.\r\nWhereas earlier none but alienists and neurologists concerned themselves\r\nwith sexual questions, an interest in these questions is now very\r\ngenerally displayed by the circles of other medical men, of\r\nanthropologists, folk-lorists, psychologists, æsthetics, and historians\r\nof civilization. One good result of this wide diffusion of interest is,\r\nas I have already remarked (pp. 455 _et seq._), that a one-sided\r\nconsideration of the problems under investigation will thereby be\r\nprevented. Every earnest investigator, to whatever discipline he may\r\npersonally belong, can here contribute something =new=, something which\r\nwill advance knowledge; but most helpful, unquestionably, can the\r\n=physician= be who, as von Schrenck-Notzing[813] declared, is competent\r\nto consider the question in relation to various other departments--those\r\nof biology, anthropology, history, belles-lettres, psychology, and\r\nforensic medicine.\r\n\r\nIt would subserve no useful purpose to enumerate once more in this place\r\nthe works of all the recent authors who have dealt with the subject of\r\nthe sexual life. In the text of the present book they have for the most\r\npart received sufficient mention.[814]\r\n\r\nOf larger monographs upon homosexuality, there still remain to be\r\nmentioned those of Havelock Ellis and J. A. Symonds,[815] A. Moll,[816]\r\nJ. Chevalier,[817] and Laupts.[818] In these works we find extensive\r\nreports of cases; and more especially in the two first mentioned do we\r\nfind a record of all the historical and critical data of homosexuality\r\nup to the time of the first publication of the “Annual for Sexual\r\nIntermediate Stages” (1899 _et seq._).\r\n\r\nA new work by Havelock Ellis[819] recently reached me, the fifth volume\r\nof the American edition of his “Studies in the Psychology of Sex,”[820]\r\ngiving an account of “Erotic Symbolism” (fetichism, exhibitionism,\r\netc.), the “Mechanism of Detumescence,” and the “Psychical Condition\r\nduring Pregnancy,” with an appendix giving an analysis of the sexual\r\ndevelopment of various individuals. This book, full of interesting\r\ndetails, will doubtless, like the earlier volumes of his “Studies,” soon\r\nappear in a German translation.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental work of A. Marro on “Puberty in Man and Woman” also\r\ndeserves especial mention. It can most usefully be consulted in the\r\nFrench edition, “La Puberté chez l’Homme et chez la Femme. Etudiée dans\r\nses Rapports avec l’Anthropologie, la Psychiatrie, la Pedagogie, et la\r\nSociologie” (Paris, 1902; 536 pp.).\r\n\r\nSpecial studies on the subject of the sexual impulse have been published\r\nby Moll[821] and Féré.[822] In Moll’s work, of which hitherto the first\r\npart only has appeared, the sexual impulse is divided into two\r\ncomponents, the “detumescence impulse”--that is, the impulse towards the\r\nevacuation of the reproductive products--and the “contrectation\r\nimpulse”--that is, the impulse towards the other individual; and from\r\nthese two components the various manifestations of sexuality are\r\nexplained. Féré, more especially, has made an exhaustive study of the\r\ninstinctive element of the sexual impulse; and, apart from this, he\r\nappears to be the most extreme advocate of the atavistic theory of\r\nsexual perversions.\r\n\r\nAn interesting study of sexual psychology, based upon the doctrine of\r\nFreud, has been published by Otto Rank.[823] The tendency of this work\r\nalso is in opposition to the degeneration-phobia.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Italian psychiatrist Pasquale Penta, “I pervertimenti\r\nsessuali nell’ uomo e Vincenzo Verzeni strangolatore di donne” (“The\r\nSexual Perversions observed in Vincenzo Verzeni, the Strangler of\r\nWomen”), Naples, 1893, contains numerous interesting details. In the\r\nfirst chapter the author gives contributions to a history of\r\npsychopathia sexualis; the second chapter contains a detailed report of\r\nVerzeni and an account of his lust-murders; in the third chapter Penta\r\ndiscusses the similarities and differences between the sexual impulse in\r\nman and in the lower animals; in the fourth chapter he deals with the\r\nbiological foundations of lust-murder; in the fifth chapter he reviews\r\nthe different sexual perversions; in the sixth chapter he considers\r\nrape; and in the seventh and last chapter he discusses the forensic\r\nimportance of rape and of sexual perversions.\r\n\r\nThe recently published work on “Sexual Biology,” by Robert Müller\r\n(Berlin, 1907), is written from the standpoint of veterinary medicine,\r\nand the sub-title of the book, “Comparative and Evolutionary Studies in\r\nthe Sexual Life of Man and the Higher Mammals,” indicates the author’s\r\nintention to elucidate the general biological roots of sexual phenomena.\r\nThis =comparative= consideration of the sexual life of man and of the\r\nhigher mammals throws a new light on many matters, and enables us to\r\nunderstand a number of phenomena of the sexual life which have hitherto\r\nseemed obscure.\r\n\r\nA comprehensive, general, popular work upon the sexual life is now in\r\ncourse of publication--“Man and Woman.” It is issued by R. Kossmann and\r\nJ. Weiss, with the collaboration of a number of leading specialists\r\n(Stuttgart, 1907). A number of illustrated sections have already been\r\nissued.\r\n\r\nFinally, two other works must be mentioned which consider the sexual\r\nlife as a whole, a larger work and a smaller one. Forel’s[824]\r\ncomprehensive book is distinguished from beginning to end by an\r\n=original, subjective= grasp of the question, and by an =optimistic view\r\nof the future=, as I have pointed out in my review of this book in the\r\n_Deutsche Aerztezeitung_. As such a subjective programme of a future\r\nsolution of sexual problems, it will ever retain a value; and we can\r\nalways follow with pleasure the demonstrations of the talented and\r\nsympathetic author, although the book is perhaps somewhat monotonous in\r\ncharacter. Its merits, moreover, are counterbalanced by the almost\r\ncomplete neglect of the numerous recent researches in almost every\r\ndepartment of the sexual life. More particularly the chapter upon\r\nsyphilis and venereal diseases, the chapter upon homosexuality and\r\nsexual perversions, and the chapter upon marriage betray this fault. The\r\nchapter on marriage is a mere extract from Westermarck. The author is\r\nfully conscious of these defects, and freely admits them; and in spite\r\nof them the book must not be ignored, because its value really lies in\r\nits subjectivity, and because we find in it so profound a conviction of\r\nthe great importance of =social= activity for the higher development of\r\nlove. A shorter consideration of sexual problems, but one abounding in\r\nparadoxes, is to be found in a book by Leo Berg.[825]\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I may give a brief survey of the reviews and other\r\nperiodical publications which are occupied with sexual questions. A\r\ngreat periodical devoted to the =entire province= of sexual research\r\ndoes not exist. Such periodicals as we have deal with separate\r\ndepartments of the sexual life. A rather insignificant periodical, _Vita\r\nSexualis_, which appeared for the first time in 1899, seems to have\r\nbecome extinct a few years later. An exceedingly valuable publication,\r\nespecially occupied with the problems of homosexuality, bisexuality, and\r\nsexual intermediate stages, is the one edited by Magnus Hirschfeld, and\r\nentitled _Annual for Sexual Intermediate Stages_ (of this eight volumes\r\nhave hitherto appeared). Purely popular and belletristic aims are\r\nsubserved by the homosexual monthly magazine _Der Eigene_ (edited by\r\nAdolf Brand). Another annual, not less valuable than the one previously\r\nmentioned, is that edited by Friedrich S. Krauss, entitled\r\n_Anthropophyteia_. This treats more especially of folk-lorist research\r\nin sexual matters, and is a true treasure-house of new facts and\r\nobservations.[826] The periodicals for the study of venereal diseases,\r\nsuch as the _Archives of Dermatology and Syphilis_, edited by F. J. Pick\r\n(hitherto eighty-two volumes), the _Monthly Magazine of Practical\r\nDermatology_, edited by Unna and Tanzer (hitherto forty-four volumes),\r\nthe _Monthly Magazine for Diseases of the Urinary Organs and Sexual\r\nHygiene_, edited by W. Hammer, in succession to K. Ries (hitherto four\r\nvolumes), and the other German and foreign dermato-urological\r\nperiodicals, also contain much material regarding venereal diseases and\r\nsexual perversions. Interesting contributions to all sexual problems, as\r\nwell as an extensive case-literature and bibliography, are to be found\r\nin the _Archives for Criminal Anthropology and Criminology_, edited by\r\nHans Gross (hitherto twenty-seven volumes), proceeding largely from the\r\npen of the learned and most original alienist Paul Näcke; also in the\r\n_Monthly Magazine for Criminal Psychology and Criminal Law Reform_,\r\nedited by Gustav Aschaffenburg; in the monthly magazine _The Protection\r\nof Motherhood; a Magazine for the Reform of Sexual Ethics_, edited by\r\nHelene Stöcker (_vide supra_, pp. 270 and 273); in the monthly magazine\r\n_Sex and Society_, edited by Karl Vanselow (hitherto two volumes); and\r\nin the illustrated magazine, under the same editorship, _Beauty_\r\n(hitherto four volumes). Finally, we have to mention certain periodicals\r\nconcerned chiefly with the aims of racial hygiene, and containing\r\nvaluable material--the _Politico-Anthropological Review_, edited by\r\nLudwig Woltmann (hitherto five years of issue), and the _Archives for\r\nRacial and Social Biology_, edited by Alfred Ploetz (hitherto three\r\nyears of issue).\r\n\r\n  [808] R. von Krafft-Ebing, “Psychopathia Sexualis.” Only Authorized\r\n  Translation from the Twelfth revised German Edition (Rebman Limited,\r\n  London, 1906).\r\n\r\n  [809] _Cf._ my “New Researches concerning the Marquis de Sade,” pp.\r\n  437-450 (Berlin, 1904).\r\n\r\n  [810] Recently A. Moll (_Enzyklopädische Jahrbücher der gesamten\r\n  Heilkunde_, 1906, vol. xiii., pp. 238, 239) has expressed the\r\n  “opinion,” =without offering the slightest proof in support of his\r\n  views=, that “The One Hundred and Twenty Days of Sodom” is a forgery.\r\n  But I myself, in my French edition of this work, have given all the\r\n  historical and critical details regarding its origin; moreover, the\r\n  original manuscript, as has been shown by the examination of all the\r\n  experts, (1) =dates from the eighteenth century=; (2) =is throughout\r\n  in de Sade’s original handwriting=; (3) =is written in his\r\n  characteristic style=; and, finally, the forgery of this manuscript, a\r\n  roll 12 metres 12 centimetres in length, written on both sides in\r\n  letters of microscopic smallness, would be an absolute impossibility.\r\n  If anything is genuine and authentic, this work is such. Dr. Albert\r\n  Eulenburg, without doubt one of the most experienced, if not the most\r\n  experienced, student of de Sade, assured me that this work\r\n  unquestionably came from de Sade’s pen. I must, therefore, reject\r\n  Moll’s opinion, which was formed independently of any proof, and\r\n  without any examination of the original manuscript, as =unscientific\r\n  and utterly futile=.\r\n\r\n  [811] In popular writings dealing with the sexual life, I have myself\r\n  found many interesting remarks, and even many new ideas.

Are we able to\r\nrecognize the existence of progress towards better things? Are there any\r\nindications of a new, nobler, happier configuration of the sexual life?\r\nThe answer is a confident and joyful “=Yes!=”\r\n\r\n=Never= before throughout the history of mankind has love evoked so\r\nearnest and so profound an interest as to-day; never has it been\r\nconsidered from so eminently =social= a standpoint as now. As I remarked\r\nat the first public meeting of the Association for the Protection of\r\nMotherhood, the idea of a reform, ennoblement, and more natural\r\nconfiguration of the sexual life harmonizes perfectly with the general\r\ntendency of our time, which has in view a resanation of all the\r\nrelationships of life. It is continually more clearly and widely\r\nrecognized that in the human sexual life, as in all other departments of\r\nhuman activity, modifications may be effected by means of =conscious=\r\nendeavour in the direction of a progressive evolution; that the\r\nrelationship between man and woman, alike in its individual and in its\r\nsocial aspects, is influenced by the changes and advances of human\r\nevolution; and that this relationship cannot be artificially confined by\r\nmain force within limits which may have been suitable to it one hundred\r\nor two hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nOur love is of this earth, afflicted with all earthly defects and\r\nsorrows. Notwithstanding this, we =affirm= it joyfully, in the confident\r\nhope that it can be saved from all hostile and destructive influences,\r\nand that it can be elevated above the transient and the casual, and\r\nmanifest itself in its finest form as =intimate, individual= love. In\r\nthe sphinx of the individual, the greatest riddle of all unquestionably\r\nlies in the alarming and elemental qualities of the sexual impulse. But\r\nthe way to liberation is obvious and open. Let us fight courageously\r\nwith all the hostile forces described in this book, which poison the\r\namatory life of our time; let us destroy all the germs of degeneration,\r\nand let us imprint upon our sexual conscience three words--=health=,\r\n=purity=, =responsibility=.\r\n\r\nOne thing more. Why does love at the present day so often threaten to\r\nperish amid the general fragmentation of life? Why do the leading\r\nspirits and the greatest artists in love complain of the fragile\r\ncharacter of all love? Because love is isolated, because it is not\r\nassociated with the =work of life=, with the battle for =freedom= which\r\nevery man has to fight; because love is not conceived as a union between\r\nthe lovers for the common =conquest of existence=, as a partnership for\r\nthe purposes of =inward spiritual growth=. Far too often the man of the\r\nfuture is opposed to the woman of the past, or the woman of the future\r\nto the man of the past; each is to the other a =sexual= being, and\r\nnothing beyond. And yet individual love is only possible when, passing\r\nbeyond the aims of mere sexual gratification, and beyond the purposes of\r\nreproduction, it subserves the general objects of life, and assists in\r\nthe performance of all the tasks of the civilization of our time. The\r\nmost wonderful dreams of the heart cannot suffice to take the place of\r\nthe positive work which life demands from love. =Without free activity\r\nthere is no love!= That is the great saying of a great thinker. And I\r\nadd to this saying, that without free activity there is no =right= to\r\nlove. Such a right is possessed only by the =personality=, the poetic,\r\nstriving, willing human being, be it man or be it woman. How often the\r\nman seeks love from the woman and cannot find it, and yet might have\r\nfound it so easily!\r\n\r\n   “... doch wenn ich suchend drücke\r\n    Die Fänge meines Geistes in ihr Hirn,\r\n    Dünkt mich, dass hinter dieser hohen Stirn\r\n    Ein Etwas liegt, das einst =gefehlt= dem Glücke.”\r\n\r\n  [“But when searchingly I press\r\n    The talons of my spirit into her brain,\r\n    It seems to me that behind this lofty forehead\r\n    Something lies which has just missed happiness.”]\r\n\r\nIn this beautiful verse of Ada Christen’s the secret of all love reveals\r\nitself. We must not seek that which is lower in the other sex, in the\r\nbeloved person; we must seek the =highest=, her spiritual essence, her\r\nwill, her developmental possibilities. Before the eyes of the modern\r\nhuman being, the individual love of two free personalities appears as an\r\nideal, as is poetically expressed by Dingelstedt in the words:\r\n\r\n   “Und Liebe blüht nur in dem =Doppel-Leben=\r\n    Verwandter Seelen, die nach oben streben.”\r\n\r\n  [“And Love blossoms only in the =duplex-life=\r\n    Of two allied souls, which together strive upwards.”]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX OF NAMES\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abderhalden, Emil, 715\r\n\r\n  Abelard, 94\r\n\r\n  Achelis, Thomas, 192\r\n\r\n  Ackermann, J.

It has two\r\nfundamental ideas--the study of nature, and the study of the psychology\r\nof man in health and in disease.\r\n\r\nTo harmonize the aspirations of human nature and the data of the\r\nsociology of the different human races and the different epochs of\r\nhistory, with the results of natural science and the laws of mental and\r\nsexual evolution which these have revealed to us, is a task which has\r\nbecome more and more necessary at the present day. It is our duty to our\r\ndescendants to contribute as far as is in our power to its\r\naccomplishment. In recognition of the immense progress of education\r\nwhich we owe to the sweat, the blood, and often to the martyrdom of our\r\npredecessors, it behoves us to prepare for our children a life more\r\nhappy than ours.\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.\r\n\r\nProfessor Forel is well known to English readers through the medium of\r\nEnglish translations of his other works on Psychiatry and kindred\r\nsubjects. The present work has already been translated into several\r\nEuropean languages. Whether we agree with all Professor Forel’s\r\nconclusions or not, we must admit that he has dealt with a difficult and\r\ndelicate subject in a masterly and scientific manner.\r\n\r\n  CONTENTS: I. -- The Reproduction of Living Beings -- History of the\r\n  Germ -- Cell-Division -- Parthenogenesis -- Conjugation -- Mneme --\r\n  Embryonic Development -- Differences of Sexes -- Castration --\r\n  Hermaphrodism -- Heredity -- Blastophthoria.

SENATOR and Dr. S.\r\n  KAMINER. Translated from the German by J. DULBERG, M.D., J.P. (of\r\n  Manchester). Demy 8vo., 452 pages. Cloth, price 10s. 6d. net.\r\n\r\nA quarter of a century has elapsed since Francis Galton, in his\r\n“Inquiries into Human Faculty,” drew attention to the urgent need for\r\nthe foundation of a science and practice of “Eugenics,” that is, the\r\nimprovement of the human stock. “Health and Disease in Relation to\r\nMarriage and the Married State,” edited by Senator and Kaminer,\r\nundoubtedly occupies a very high place among recent works devoted to the\r\nelucidation of certain aspects of this important topic, and in the\r\nabridged edition an adaptation has been prepared for the enlightenment\r\nof the thinking portion of the public on pathological questions in\r\nrelation to marriage and the married state, and from which all purely\r\ntechnical and professional matter has been excluded.\r\n\r\nAt a time when such questions as the decline of the birth-rate, the\r\nsterilization of the degenerate, the restriction of indiscriminate\r\nmarriages, the voluntary limitation of families, and so forth, form\r\nsubjects of daily debate and newspaper articles, it is of the greatest\r\nadvantage that every man and woman who either contemplates or has\r\nembarked on matrimony should be as well acquainted, as the limits of our\r\nconventionality permit, with the medical or hygienic aspect of\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nTo give some idea of the scope of this absorbingly interesting work, we\r\nappend the chapter headings. These apply to the unabridged as well as to\r\nthe abridged edition at present under review.\r\n\r\n  I. -- Introduction. II. -- The Hygiene of Marriage. III. -- Congenital\r\n  and Inherited Diseases and Predispositions to Disease. IV. --\r\n  Consanguinity and Marriage. V. -- Climate, Race, and Nationality in\r\n  Relation to Marriage. VI. -- Sexual Hygiene. VII. -- Menstruation,\r\n  Pregnancy, Child-bed and Lactation. VIII. -- Constitutional\r\n  (Metabolic) Diseases. IX. -- Diseases of the Blood. X. -- Diseases of\r\n  the Vascular System. XI. -- Diseases of the Respiratory Organs. XII.\r\n  -- Diseases of the Organs of Digestion. XIII. -- Diseases of the\r\n  Kidneys. XIV. -- Gonorrhœal Diseases. XV. -- (_a_) Syphilis. XVI. --\r\n  (_b_) Diseases of the Skin. XVII. -- Diseases of the Organs of\r\n  Locomotion. XVIII. -- Diseases of the Eyes in Relation to Marriage,\r\n  with special regard to Heredity. XIX. -- Diseases of the Lower\r\n  Uro-Genital Organs and Physical Impotence. XX. -- Diseases of Women,\r\n  including Sterility. XXI. -- Diseases of the Nervous System. XXII. --\r\n  Insanity. XXIII. -- Perverse Sexual Sensations and Psychical\r\n  Impotence. XXIV. -- Alcoholism and Morphinism. XXV. -- Occupational\r\n  Injuries. XXVI. -- Medico-Professional Secrecy. XXVII. -- The Economic\r\n  Importance of Sanitary Conditions.\r\n\r\nBrief as is this sketch of the abridged edition, it will suffice, in\r\nconjunction with the following extracts from a few of the many highly\r\nlaudatory reviews, to show how valuable the work will be to parents and\r\nguardians, family advisers, whether lawyers or clergymen, schoolmasters\r\nand schoolmistresses, as well as to those who are already married, and\r\nto those who are contemplating marriage.\r\n\r\n  _THE LANCET_ says: “The progress of sociological investigation in\r\n  modern times has caused increased attention to be paid to questions of\r\n  health in relation to marriage and the propagation of the human race,\r\n  and anything which helps to spread abroad an intelligent appreciation\r\n  of the dangers incurred, not only by individuals who enter on the\r\n  married state, but also by their offspring, from the existence of many\r\n  forms of disease must be regarded as a public benefit. The present\r\n  book is an attempt to make available for general consumption the gist\r\n  of the larger work from which it is taken.... The material contained\r\n  in the book is most valuable, and a study of it should be useful to\r\n  those capable of appreciating it....”\r\n\r\n  _PUBLIC HEALTH_ says: “It is cleanly, even when dealing with most\r\n  difficult subjects, and it is a storehouse of information on points on\r\n  which hygienists are expected to be well informed.”\r\n\r\n  _THE SCOTTISH MEDICAL JOURNAL_ says: “As a guide for the general\r\n  public many of the articles are well adapted to fulfil their object.”\r\n\r\n  _THE DAILY DISPATCH_ says: “... every work that helps to enlightenment\r\n  is to be welcomed so long as it comes with credentials as to its\r\n  honesty and guarantees that it is not merely a device for making money\r\n  out of ignorance. ‘Marriage and Disease’ has all the essential claims\r\n  to consideration. Dr. Dulberg has very ably condensed the larger\r\n  manual into one of 450 pages, containing 27 chapters. The volume is of\r\n  absorbing interest, not only for its arguments and conclusions, but\r\n  also, and perhaps mainly, for the wealth of information it contains on\r\n  matrimonial and sex questions in all countries and climes.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_From the Twelfth German Edition._\r\n\r\nPSYCHOPATHIA SEXUALIS\r\n\r\n  With Special Reference to Antipathic Sexual Instinct.
