'\"Davy Wilson,\" he said, \"commonly\r\ncalled Snuffy Davy, from his inveterate addiction to black rappee, was\r\nthe very prince of scouts for searching blind alleys, cellars, and\r\nstalls, for rare volumes. He had the scent of a slow-hound, sir, and the\r\nsnap of a bull-dog. He would detect you an old black-letter ballad among\r\nthe leaves of a law-paper, and find an _editio princeps_ under the mask\r\nof a school Corderius. Snuffy Davy bought the 'Game of Chess, 1474,' the\r\nfirst book ever printed in England, from a stall in Holland for about\r\ntwo groschen, or two-pence of our money. He sold it to Osborne for\r\ntwenty pounds, and as many books as came to twenty pounds more. Osborne\r\nre-sold this inimitable windfall to Dr. Askew for sixty guineas. At Dr.\r\nAskew's sale,\" continued the old gentleman, kindling as he spoke, \"this\r\ninestimable treasure blazed forth in its full value and was purchased by\r\nRoyalty itself for one hundred and seventy pounds! Could a copy now\r\noccur, Lord only knows,\" he ejaculated with a deep sigh and lifted-up\r\nhands, \"Lord only knows what would be its ransom; and yet it was\r\noriginally secured, by skill and research, for the easy equivalent of\r\ntwo-pence sterling.\"'\r\n\r\nSir Walter Scott in a footnote adds:--\"This bibliomaniacal anecdote is\r\nliterally true; and David Wilson, the author need not tell his brethren\r\nof the Roxburghe and Bannatyne Clubs, was a real personage.\" Mr. Blades,\r\nwhose iconoclastic temper is not moved to mercy even by this good story,\r\nsays that although it \"looks like a true bibliographical anecdote,\" its\r\nappearance is deceptive, and that \"not a single statement is founded\r\non fact.\"[1]\r\n\r\nJonathan Oldbuck did not venture to estimate the sum that would ransom a\r\ncopy of the \"Game of Chesse,\" and the world of the bibliomania has moved\r\neven since his days, so that prices which seemed fabulous, and were\r\nrecounted with a sort of awe-struck wonder, have been surpassed in these\r\nlatter days, and the chances of any successor of \"Snuffy Davy\" buying a\r\nCaxton for two groschen have been greatly reduced.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. William Blades, our latest and best authority on the\r\nsubject, there are but ten copies known of the first edition of the\r\n\"Chesse\" book.[2] There is a perfect copy in the King's Library in the\r\nBritish Museum. This is what ought to be Snuffy Davy's copy. A previous\r\nowner--R. Boys--has noted that it cost him 3_s_. The copy in the\r\nGrenville Library has the table and last leaf supplied in facsimile. The\r\ncopy in the Public Library at Cambridge is defective to the extent of\r\nfive leaves. The Bodleian copy wants the last leaf. The Duke of\r\nDevonshire's copy formerly belonged to Roger Wilbraham, and the first\r\nand eighth leaves are supplied in facsimile. The exemplar belonging to\r\nthe Earl of Pembroke is perfect, \"but on weak and stained paper.\" Earl\r\nSpencer's copy is perfect, clean, and unusually large. Mr. H. Cunliffe's\r\ncopy came from the Alchorne and Inglis Libraries, and wants the first\r\ntwo printed leaves, two near the end, and the last two. Mr. J. Holford's\r\ncopy is perfect and in its original binding. It was once in the library\r\nof Sir Henry Mainwaring of Peover Hall, as his bookplate shows. On a\r\nfly-leaf is written, \"Ex dono Thomæ Delves, Baronett 1682.\" The copy\r\nbelonging to the Rev. Edward Bankes is imperfect, and wants the\r\ndedicatory leaf and is slightly wormed.\r\n\r\nThe book, when complete, consists of eight quaternions or eight leaves\r\nfolded together and one quinternion or section of five sheets folded\r\ntogether, making in all seventy-four leaves, of which the first and last\r\nare blank. The only type used throughout is that styled No. 1 by Mr.\r\nBlades. The lines are not spaced out; the longest measure five inches; a\r\nfull page has thirty-one lines. Without title-page, signatures,\r\nnumerals, or catch-words. The volume, as already mentioned, begins with\r\na blank leaf, and on the second recto is Caxton's prologue, space being\r\nleft for a two-line initial, without director. The text begins with a\r\ndedication:--\"(T)o the right noble/ right excellent & vertuous prince\r\nGeorge duc of Clarence Erl of Warwyk and of Salisburye/ grete\r\nchamberlayn of Englond & leutenant of Ireland oldest broder of kynge\r\nEdward by the grace of god kynge of England and of France/ your most\r\nhumble servant william Caxton amonge other of your servantes sendes unto\r\nyow peas. helthe. Joye and victorye upon your Enemyes/ Right highe\r\npuyssant and.\" The text ends on the seventy-third recto, thus:--\"And\r\nsende yow thaccomplisshement of your hye noble. Joyous and vertuous\r\ndesirs Amen:/: Fynysshid the lastday of Marche the yer of our lord god.\r\na. thousand foure honderd and LXXIIII. *. *. *. *.\" The seventy-fourth\r\nleaf is blank.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to say that this book seldom comes into the market.\r\nThe recorded sales are very few. In 1682 R. Smith sold a perfect copy\r\nfor 13s. 2d. In 1773 J. West's copy was bought by George III. for.£32\r\n0s. 6d. Alchorne's imperfect copy was bought by Inglis for £54 12s., and\r\nat the sale of his books found a purchaser in Lord Audley for £31 10s.,\r\nand was again transferred, in 1855, to the possession of Mr. J. Cunliffe\r\nfor £60 l0s. 0d.[3] Mr. J. Holford's copy was bought at the Mainwaring\r\nsale for £101.\r\n\r\nThe last copy offered for sale was described in one of Mr. Bernard\r\nQuaritch's catalogues issued in 1872, and the account given by that\r\nveteran bibliopole is well worth reproduction.\r\n\r\nCAXTON'S GAME AND PLAY OF CHESS MORALIZED, (translated 1474) FIRST\r\nEDITION, folio, 65 LEAVES (of the 72), bound in old ruffia gilt, £400.\r\n\r\n    [Blackletter: Fynyshid the last day of Marche the yer of our Lord God,\r\n         a thousand foure hondred and lxxiiii....]\r\n\r\nAn extremely large, though somewhat imperfect copy of\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST BOOK PRINTED IN ENGLAND, from Caxton's press.\r\n\r\nMr. Blades quotes 9 copies (4 perfect, 5 imperfect), the present is the\r\n10th known copy, and is TALLER than even the Grenville--hitherto the\r\ntallest known copy; my copy measures 11-1/8 inch in height by 8 in\r\nwidth, whilst the Grenville copy (also imperfect) is only 11\r\ninches high.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLATION of _my copy_:\r\n\r\n[Blackletter: This Booke conteyneth iiii traytees]          1 _leaf_.\r\n[Blackletter: This first chapiter of the first tractate]    1 _leaf_.\r\n[Blackletter: The trouthe for to do Justice right wysly,]\r\n   etc. to the end                                         62 _leaves_.\r\n  _The last leaf with the date:_\r\n[Blackletter: In conquerynge his rightful inheritance,]\r\n  _ending:_ [Blackletter: fynyshed], _etc._ 1474  1 _leaf_.\r\n                                                           -------------\r\n                                                           65 leaves.\r\n\r\nMy copy wants therefore 7 leaves, the two blank ones being out of\r\nquestion. The imperfections include the first leaf, and two leaves in\r\nthe second chapitre of the fourth tractate, the end is all right. I\r\nshould be glad to hear of any IMPERFECT COPY of this work, which would\r\nsupply me with what I want. In the mean time this precious relic of the\r\nInfancy of Printing in England can be feen by BUYERS of Rare books.\r\n\r\n_See_ Dibdin's Bibl. Spenc. IV. p. 189.\r\n\r\nNo copy of this edition has been sold for years; in 1813, Alchorne's\r\ncopy, wanting first two leaves, the last two leaves and two leaves in\r\nthe second chapter of the fourth tractate, fetched at Evans', £54.\r\n12_s_. The value of this class of books has much risen since then, and\r\nmay now be considered, as ten times greater.\r\n\r\nIn comparing the first edition of \"Caxton's Game of Chess\" with the\r\nsecond, one perceives many variations in the spelling. I confider the\r\n_first edition_ to be the more interesting, for a variety of reasons:\r\n\r\n1. It is the first book printed in England.\r\n2. It is the _Editio princeps_ of the English version.\r\n3. It shows the Art of Printing in its crudest form.\r\n4. It has a Post-script not in the second edition.\r\n\r\nBoth editions run on together to the passage on the last page of the\r\nsecond edition:\r\n\r\n[Blackletter:\r\nAnd a mon that lyvyth in thys world without vertues lyveth not\r\nas a man but as a beste.]\r\n\r\nThe first edition ends thus:\r\n\r\n[Blackletter: And therefore my right redoubted Lord I pray almighty god\r\nto save the Kyng our soverain lord to gyve him grace to yssue as a Kynge\r\ntabounde in all vertues/ to be assisted with all other his lordes in\r\nsuch wyse yn his noble royame of England may prospere/ habounde in\r\nvertues and yn synne may be eschewid justice kepte/ the royame defended\r\ngood men rewarded malefactours punyshid the ydle peple to be put to\r\nlaboure that he wyth the nobles of the royame may regne gloriously.\r\n\r\nIn conquerynge his rightfull inheritaunce / that verraypeas and charitie\r\nmay endure in both his royames and that marchandise may have his cours\r\nin suche wise that every man eschewe synne/ and encrese in vertuous\r\noccupacions / Praynge your good grace to resseyve this lityll and symple\r\nbook made under the hope and shadow of your noble protection by hym that\r\nis your most humble servant in gree and thanke.

Petit.[4]\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that Mr. Quaritch calls the _editio princeps_ of\r\nCaxton's \"Game and Play of the Chesse\" the first book printed in\r\nEngland. This was the general opinion of bibliographers before the\r\ninvestigations of Mr. Blades. Dibdin, although he seems to have had some\r\ndoubt, pronounced in favour of that view. Yet it is clearly erroneous.\r\nThe only materials for judgment are those afforded by the colophon and\r\nthe prologue to the second edition, with the silent but eloquent\r\ntestimony of typography. Caxton ends the first edition with the\r\nwords:--\"Fynysshid the last day of Marche the yer of our lord god a\r\nthousand four hondred and LXXIIII.\" The word \"fynysshid,\" as Mr. Blades\r\nobserves, \"has doubtless the same signification here as in the epilogue\r\nto the second book of Caxton's translation of the Histories of Troy,\r\n'Begonne in Brugis, contynued in Gaunt and finysshed in Coleyn,' which\r\nevidently refers to the translation only. The date, 1475-6, has been\r\naffixed, because in the Low Countries at that time the year commenced on\r\nEaster-day; this in 1474 fell on April 10th, thus giving, as the day of\r\nthe conclusion of the translation, 31 March 1475, the same year being\r\nthe earliest possible period of its appearance as a printed book.\" Then\r\nthere is Caxton's own racy account of the circumstances under which the\r\nbook first appeared:--\r\n\r\n\"And emong alle other good werkys It is a werke of ryght special\r\nrecomendacion to enforme and to late vnderstonde wysedom and vertue vnto\r\nthem that be not lernyd ne can not dyscerne wysedom fro folye Th[=e]ne\r\nemonge whom there was an excellent doctour of dyuynyte in the royame of\r\nfraunce of the ordre of thospytal of Saynt Johns of Jherusalem which\r\nentended the same and hath made a book of the chesse moralysed whiche at\r\nsuche tyme as I was resident in brudgys in the counte of Flaundres cam\r\ninto my handes/ whiche whan I had redde and ouerseen/ me semed ful\r\nnecessarye for to be had in englisshe/ And in eschewyng of ydlenes And\r\nto thende that s[=o]me which haue not seen it/ ne [=v]nderstonde frenssh\r\nne latyn J delybered in my self to translate it in to our maternal\r\ntonge/ And whan I so had achyeued the sayd translacion/ J dyde doo sette\r\nin enprynte a certeyn nombre of theym/ Whiche anone were depesshed and\r\nsolde wherfore by cause thys sayd book is ful of holsom wysedom and\r\nrequysyte vnto euery astate and degree/ J haue purposed to enprynte it/\r\nshewyng therin the figures of suche persons as longen to the playe.\"\r\n\r\nIt is clear from this that both the translation and printing belong to\r\nthe period of Caxton's residence in Bruges. From the use of the\r\ninstrumental form \"dyde doo sette en enprynte\" it might be thought that\r\nCaxton employed the services of some printer, but although commonly so\r\nemployed, there are instances which will not bear this interpretation of\r\nits intention.[5] He either employed a printer or made some partnerfhip\r\nwith one, and there are various indications that confirm Mr. Blades'\r\ntheory that the book came from the press of Colard Mansion.\r\n\r\nThe second edition is undoubtedly the work of our first English printer.\r\n\"Explicit per Caxton\" is the unambiguous statement of the colophon. It\r\nis a much more advanced specimen of typography than the first edition.\r\nIt has signatures, of which _a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i,_ are\r\nquaternions, _k_ and _l_ are terternions, making in all eighty-four\r\nleaves, of which the first is blank. There is no title-page, and the\r\ntype used is that which Mr. Blades reckons as No. 2*. The lines are\r\nspaced out to an even length. There are twenty-nine lines to a full\r\npage, and the full line measures 4-7/8 inches. The prologue begins on _a\r\nij_., and the table of chapters begins on the next page. The text begins\r\non the recto of _a iii_. The text ends on the recto of _l_ 6, the last\r\npage being blank. There are sixteen woodcuts in the volume, which are\r\nused twenty-four times. There has been some diversity of opinion as to\r\nthe year in which this \"Game of the Chesse\" came from the press of\r\nCaxton. The book is not dated. Dibdin thought it one of the printer's\r\nearliest efforts. Figgins regarded it as the earliest issue of the\r\nWestminster press, and further believed that it was printed from cut\r\nmetal types. This is not the view of Mr. Blades, who says: \"An\r\nexamination of the work, however, with a typographical eye does not\r\nafford a single evidence of very early workmanship. All Caxton's early\r\nbooks were uneven in the length of their lines--this is quite even. Not\r\none of the early works had any signatures--this is signed throughout.\r\nThese two features alone are quite sufficient to fix its date of\r\nimpression at least as late as 1480, when Caxton first began the use of\r\nsignatures; but when we find that every known copy of this edition of\r\nthe 'Chess-Book' presents a thicker and more worn appearance than any\r\none copy of any other book, there is good reason for supposing that this\r\nmay have followed the 'Tulli' of 1481, and have been the last book for\r\nwhich Type No. 2* was used.\"[6]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Blades describes nine known copies, so that even fewer exemplars\r\nremain of the second edition than of its predecessor. The copy in the\r\nKing's Library in the British Museum is imperfect, wanting several\r\nleaves, and is mended in many places. The copy in the Pepysian\r\nCollection at Cambridge wants one-half of the last leaf. Trinity\r\nCollege, Cambridge, has a perfect copy, \"but a bad impression.\" The\r\nBodleian copy is defective in not having the last leaf. St. John's\r\nCollege, Oxford, has a copy, from which one-half of _d iii_. has been\r\ntorn away. The Imperial Library at Vienna has an imperfect copy. The\r\nDuke of Devonshire's copy is perfect, but it is \"a poor impression, and\r\nslightly stained.\" The Earl of Pembroke's copy is very imperfect. Earl\r\nSpencer's is only slightly imperfect. The prices fetched by the second\r\nedition have a sufficiently wide range. In 1698, at Dr. Bernard's sale,\r\na copy fold for 1s. 6d. Farmer's copy in 1798 fetched £4 4s. Ratcliffe's\r\ncopy was bought at his sale for £16 by Willett; and when his books came\r\nto the hammer in 1813, it was purchased by the Duke of Devonshire for\r\n£173 5s.[7] It is interesting to know that the copy of the second\r\nedition in the Bibliotheca Spenceriana formerly belonged to Laurence\r\nSterne, who bought it for a few shillings at York![8]\r\n\r\nIn the present reprint, the text followed is that of the first edition,\r\ntranscribed from the copy in the British Museum; but the variations,\r\nalterations, and additions made in the second issue are all recorded in\r\nfootnotes. The reader has, therefore, before him the work in all its\r\nfulness. The same reasons that have led to the adoption of this course\r\nhave also decided the publisher to include facsimiles of the curious\r\nwoodcuts which appeared in the second edition. These, although\r\nnecessarily reductions in size, reproduce the quaint vigour of the\r\noriginals.\r\n\r\nCaxton, we have seen, translated the \"Game of the Chesse\" from the\r\nFrench. There were in effect two, if not three, from which he may have\r\ntaken his version. One of these is by Jean Faron, Perron, or Feron (as\r\nthe name is variously spelled), a monk of the order of St. Dominic, of\r\nwhom the notices are exceedingly scanty.[9] La Croix du Maine styles him\r\n\"de l'Ordre des Frères Prescheurs ou Jacobins du Paris.\" La Monnaye says\r\nthat the translation was made from the Latin of Cessoles, and was begun\r\nin the year 1347. It has not been printed.[10] The translation is\r\nconsidered a literal version of the Latin of Cessoles.\r\n\r\nThe prologue of Perron's version is as follows:--\"Chy ensuit le geu des\r\nEschas moralisé, ouquel a plusiers exemples bien à noter. A noblehomme,\r\nBertrand de Tarascon, frere Jehan Perron, de l'ordre des Freres\r\nprecheurs de Paris, son petil et humble chappelain soy tout.

Or est-il ainsi que nos prochains ne\r\nsont pas tout un, ains sont de diverses condicions, estas et manieres,\r\nsy comme il appert.

Thus Mr. Blades\r\nmentions the description of Evilmerodach as \"un homme joly sans justice\"\r\nas peculiar to Ferron, whose version he regards as the basis of the\r\nfirst and third chapters of Caxton's work.\r\n\r\nDr. Van der Linde mentions a number of MSS.; in some the date is given\r\nas 1357, and in one as 1317. This version remains unprinted, but there\r\nare MSS. of it in the Bibliotheque Nationale, at Aosta, Cambrai, at\r\nBrussels, in the British Museum, Chartres, at Bern, and at Stockholm.[12]\r\n\r\nDr. Van der Linde also describes a MS. on parchment of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, forming part of the national library at Paris, which contains\r\nthe Game of Chess in verse.\r\n\r\n   \"Mès si d'esbat te prent tallant,\r\n    Pren ton esbat déuement;\r\n    Mès si à jouer vieulx attendre,\r\n    Un noble jou te faulte attendre,\r\n    C'est des echecs qui est licite\r\n    Et à touz bien les gens incite.\"\r\n\r\nThe author has concealed his name with an ingenuity that has so far\r\ndefied penetration.\r\n\r\n   \"Nommez mon nom et mon surnom,\r\n    Je ey escript tout environ,\r\n    A vingt et dous lettres sans plus,\r\n    Sera trouvé cy au dessus\r\n    En enscript, et sans plus ne moins.\"\r\n\r\nOn this it is only necesiary to quote the remarks of a French\r\ncritic:--\"Ou ne nous dit pas si c'est dans la suite même de la phrase,\r\nou seulement en acrosticke, que se trouvent les vingt-deux lettres de\r\nces nom mystérieux. Nous ne saurions former aucun nom avec les initiales\r\ndes trente vers qui précèdent ceux que nous venons de citer; et le\r\nmerite de l'ouvrage ne nous encourage pas à faire des longues recherches\r\npour découvrir un nom que l'auteur a pris plaisir à nous cacher.\"[13]\r\n\r\nThe bulk of Caxton's work is undoubtedly from the French translation of\r\nJehan de Vignay, whose dedication to Prince John of France has simply\r\nbeen transformed into a similar address to the Duke of Clarence. He\r\nstyles De Vignay \"an excellent doctor of the order of the Hospital of\r\nSt. John's of Jerusalem.\" This is the only authority we have for\r\nsupposing De Vignay to be connected with that order. He styles himself\r\n\"hospitaller de l'ordre de haut pas,\" which was situated in the Faubourg\r\nSt. Jacques of Paris. It is curious that two members of the same\r\norder--for Ferron was also a Jacobin--should independently have occupied\r\nthemselves with the same work. The version by De Vignay was probably the\r\nlater of the two, and it was also the most popular, for whilst Ferron's\r\nis still unprinted, that of De Vignay has been frequently re-issued from\r\nthe press. The work is dedicated to Jean de France, Duc de Normandie,\r\nwho became king in 1350. It will be seen from this that these two French\r\nversions were practically contemporaneous.\r\n\r\nThe prologue to the book is as follows:--\"A Tres noble & excellent\r\nprince Jehan de france duc de normendie & auisne filz de philipe par le\r\ngrace de dieu Roy de france. Frere Jehan de vignay vostre petit\r\nReligieux entre les autres de vostre seignorie/ paix sante Joie &\r\nvictoire sur vos ennemis.

The \"Golden Legend,\" printed by\r\nCaxton in 1484, was in effect a translation from \"La Legende Dorée,\"\r\nmade before the year 1380 by Jehan de Vignay, who in his prologue\r\nmentions that he had previously translated into French \"Le miroir des\r\nhystoires du monde,\" at the request of \"Ma dame Jehanne de Borgoigne,\r\nroyne de France.\"[15] This preface Caxton, as usual, adopted with some\r\nchanges of name and other alterations, amongst which is a reference to\r\n\"the book of the chesse\" as one of his works. The \"Legenda Aurea\" of\r\nJacobus de Voragine is, of course, the original source of De Vignay's\r\n\"Legende Dorée,\" and Caxton's \"Golden Legend.\"\r\n\r\nFerron and de Vignay were avowedly translators. Their original was\r\nJacques de Cessoles. The name of this author has been tortured into so\r\nmany fantastic forms that one may almost despair of recovering the\r\noriginal. Cæsolis, Cassalis, Castulis, Casulis, Cesolis, Cessole,\r\nCessulis, Cesulis, Cezoli, de Cezolis, de Cossoles, de Courcelles,\r\nSesselis, Tessalis, Tessellis, de Thessolus, de Thessolonia, and de\r\nThessolonica are different manners of spelling his surname, and the two\r\nlast are certainly masterpieces of transformation. Prosper Marchand has\r\namused himself by collecting some vain speculations of previous writers\r\nas to the age, country, and personality of Jacques de Cessoles. Some\r\ncounted him a Lombard, some an Italian, whilst others again boldly\r\nasserted that he was a Greek!\r\n\r\nHe lived towards the end of the thirteenth or beginning of the\r\nfourteenth century, and having joined the Dominican order, was a \"Maître\r\nen Théologie\" of that brotherhood at Reims. Various works are attributed\r\nto him, and his learning and piety had many eulogists.\r\n\r\nIt is more than probable that his name would have been much less widely\r\nknown but for the happy accident that turned his attention to the game\r\nof chess. It was a popular diversion, and in the moralizing spirit of\r\nthe age he saw in it an allegory of the various components of the\r\ncommonwealth. The men who were merely killing time were perhaps\r\nflattered at the thought that they were at the same time learning the\r\nmodes of statecraft. Then, as now, the teachers of morality felt that a\r\nsong might reach him who a sermon flies, and they did not scruple to use\r\nin the pulpit whatever aids came handy. The popular stories, wise saws,\r\nand modern instances, were common enough on the lips of the preachers,\r\nand such collections as the \"Gesta Romanorum show what a pitch of\r\ningenuity in unnatural interpretation they had reached. An appropriate\r\ninstance is furnished by it in the following quaint fashion of\r\nmoralizing the chess play:--\r\n\r\n   \"Antonius was a wys emp_er_our regnyng in the cite of Rome, the which\r\n   vsid moche to pley with houndis; and aftir þat pley, all þe day\r\n   aftir he wolde vse þe chesse.

And þat graunt vs, _qui viuit_ &c.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not, therefore, surprising to learn that Jacques de Cessoles found\r\ntexts for sundry sermons on the game that formed so favourite a\r\ndiversion of clergy and laity. The favour with which these discourses\r\nwere received no doubt gratified the worthy Dominican father. At the\r\nrequest of some of those who heard them he began to write down the\r\nsubstance of his sermons. The result was the \"Liber de moribus Hominum\r\net officiis Nobilium ac Popularium super ludo scachorum,\" which\r\nimmediately attained great popularity. This is shown by the bibliography\r\nof Dr. A. Van der Linde in a striking manner, for he has described two\r\nhundred codices to be found in the various public libraries of\r\nEurope.[16]\r\n\r\nThe difficulties in the way of forming any clear conception as to the\r\nlife and personality of Cessoles, Ferron, and De Vignay are well shown\r\nin an article by M.C. Leber.[17] Dr. Ernst Köpke, who has reexamined the\r\nevidences as to Cessoles, holds that he was a Lombard.[18]\r\n\r\nThe chief source from which Cessoles took his material was the treatise\r\n\"De Regimine Principum\" of Egidius Romanus.\r\n\r\nHe was of the great Neapolitan family of the Colonna, and his Christian\r\nname appears to have been Guido, but his designations have undergone\r\nsome curious transformations. Born at Rome, 22nd Sept., 1216, Guido\r\nColonna went at an early age to Paris, where, from the name of his\r\nbirthplace, he became known as Ægidius Romanus, with the French form of\r\nGilles de Rome. He was an ardent and enthusiastic disciple of St. Thomas\r\nAquinas, and his familiarity with that great doctor of the Church led\r\nhim to desire admission to the Dominican order, but a difficulty\r\nintervened from the circumstance that he had already contracted ties\r\nwhich bound him to the order of St. Augustine. To this untoward accident\r\nmay probably be attributed no little of the extension of the\r\nphilosophical doctrine of Aquinas; for Colonna, unable or unwilling to\r\nbe relieved of the vows that bound him to the Augustinians, preached\r\neagerly amongst them the Thomist speculations of his friend and master.\r\nIn the controversy with the Franciscans, those whom he had indoctrinated\r\nwere valuable allies to the Thomists, for their aid, coming from an\r\nindependent organization, appeared to carry the weight of impartiality,\r\nand to be unassailable on the plea of partisan interest. In the year\r\n1287 there was a general convocation of the order of St. Augustine at\r\nFlorence, and at this assembly it was decreed that the doctors of the\r\norder should teach in conformity with the decisions arrived at by\r\nColonna. To him is largely due the success of the Thomist scheme, of\r\nwhich he was an able, persistent, and vigorous exponent. Many tracts by\r\nhim remain in print and MS. on these subjects. The fame he had thus\r\nacquired gained him the name of _doctor fundamentarius_ and _doctor\r\nfundatissimus_. His lectures at Paris attracted to him the attention of\r\nPhilippe le Hardi, who thought him a fitting person to be entrusted with\r\nthe education of his son, who was afterwards known to hiftory as\r\nPhilippe le Bel. It was whilst occupied with this royal youth that the\r\nthought of composing or compiling--and the terms were in practice\r\ninterchangeable in those days--occurred, and the result was the treatise\r\n\"De regimine Principum libri iii.\" Philippe le Hardi, if not an educated\r\nman himself--and there are doubts as to whether he could write his own\r\nname--was laudably anxious that his heir should have the best\r\ninstruction that could be obtained. It cannot well be claimed that the\r\nable, handsome, and unscrupulous Philippe was any great credit to his\r\npreceptor. The despotic and perfidious character of the king probably\r\nowed more to the influence of Nogaret and other defenders of the \"right\r\ndivine of kings to govern wrong,\" than to the soberer precepts of\r\nColonna. That Philippe had some tincture of literary feeling may be\r\ninferred from his employment of Jehan de Meung to translate the military\r\ntreatise of Vegetius Flavius Renatus, a compilation of the second\r\ncentury of the present era, which was so popular in the middle ages that\r\nit was translated by Caxton into English. Still better evidence is the\r\ntranslation made for the king by the same poet of Boethius, whose\r\nstoical philosophy must have had a special appropriateness for those\r\ntimes of political storm and stress, when the fickleness of fortune must\r\nhave been a matter of only too common repute. Guido Colonna was elected\r\nby his admiring brethren the general of the order in 1292, and took up\r\nhis residence at Bourges, its metropolitan seat.\r\n\r\nIn this honourable office he continued his literary labours, and to this\r\nperiod are assigned the greater part of his numerous works. He died at\r\nAvignon in 1316. His body was translated to Paris, where his effigy in\r\nblack marble, with his epitaph, remained until the French\r\nrevolution.[19] It would be superfluous to enumerate his philosophical\r\nwritings, for they would have no interest in the present day. His\r\ncommentary on Aristotle \"De Anima,\" it may be observed, was dedicated to\r\nEdward I. His name is now chiefly remembered because his work on the\r\nrule of princes formed the basis of the treatise in which Jacques de\r\nCessoles moralized the fashionable game of the chess.\r\n\r\nOne interesting instance of the popularity of Colonna's work is the\r\ntranslation of it made into English verse by Thomas Occleve.[20] He\r\nwrote it in 1411 or 1412, and its object was to obtain the payment of an\r\nannuity from the exchequer which had been granted to him, but the\r\npayment of which was very irregular. The book was dedicated to the\r\nPrince of Wales. After mentioning his purpose to translate from the\r\n(apocryphal) letter of Aristotle to Alexander and \"Gyles of Regement of\r\nPrynces,\" he proceeds:--\r\n\r\n   \"There is a booke, Jacob de Cessoles,\r\n    Of the ordre of Prechours, made, a worthy man,\r\n\r\n    That the Chesse moralisede clepede is,\r\n    In whiche I purpose eke to labour ywis\r\n    And here and there, as that my litelle witte\r\n    Afforthe may, I thynke translate it.\r\n\r\n    And al be it that in that place square\r\n    Of the lystes, I meane the eschekere,\r\n    A man may learn to be wise and ware;\r\n    I that have avanturede many a yere,\r\n    My witte therein is but litelle the nere,\r\n    Save that somewhat I know a Kynges draught,\r\n    Of other draughts lernede have I naught.\"--(p. 77.)\r\n\r\n\"In those days,\" says Warton, \"ecclesiastics and schoolmen presumed to\r\ndictate to kings and to give rules for administering states, drawn from\r\nthe narrow circle of speculation, and conceived amid the pedantries of a\r\ncloister. It was probably recommended to Occleve's notice by having been\r\ntranslated into English by John Trevisa, a celebrated translator about\r\nthe year 1390.[21]\r\n\r\nHaving thus traced the stream back to its fountain, we return to Caxton.\r\nThe story of his life has been told by Mr. Blades, and only the most\r\nessential facts of his busy and useful career need be recapitulated\r\nhere. He was born in the Weald of Kent, and it has been conjectured that\r\nthe manor of Caustons, near Hadlow, was the original home of the family.\r\nHe was apprenticed to Alderman Robert Large, a mercer, who was\r\nafterwards Lord Mayor. The entry in the books of the Mercers' Company\r\nleads to the inference that Caxton was born about 1422. Probably on the\r\ndeath of Large, in 1441, Caxton went abroad, for he tells us that in\r\n1471 he had been resident outside England for thirty years. About 1462\r\nor 1463 he was Governor of the English Nation or Merchant Adventurers at\r\nBruges. This was a position of great influence, and it is thought to\r\nhave enabled the loyal mercer to give good service to Edward IV., who\r\nwas an exile in 1470. Caxton's marriage was not much later than 1469,\r\nand it is conjectured that this led him to enter the service of the\r\nDuchess of Burgundy. She had literary tastes, and at her request he\r\ntranslated the \"Recuyell des Histoires de Troyes\" of Raoul Le Fevre. It\r\nwas the demand for copies of this that exhausted Caxton's calligraphic\r\npatience, and led to his employment of a printer. The incident may have\r\nbeen casual, but it led to great results. It has been said that he\r\nlearned the printers' art at Cologne, but Mr. Blades supposes that he\r\nentered its mystery at Bruges under Colard Mansion, with whom he appears\r\nto have had some partnership. Probably towards the end of 1476 Caxton\r\nreturned to England. He had the favour of Edward IV. and of his sister,\r\nDuchess of Burgundy, and the friendship of the King's brother-in-law,\r\nEarl Rivers. Ninety-nine distinct productions issued from Caxton's\r\npress, he was printer, publisher, translator, and something of author as\r\nwell. He set in good earnest about the work that is still going on--of\r\nmaking the best accessible literature widely and commonly known. This\r\nuseful career was only ended by his death. The exact date is not known,\r\nbut it was probably late in 1491. He left a married daughter. Caxton was\r\na good business man. He was also a sincere lover of literature, and he\r\nwas at his favourite work of translation only a few hours before the\r\nfinal summons came.\r\n\r\nThe quality of Caxton as a translator is not a matter of much doubt. It\r\nmay be that the archaic forms give an additional flavour to his style,\r\nsince they present few difficulties to the modern reader, and yet sound\r\nlike echoes from the earlier periods of the language. Generally he is\r\ncontent to follow his author with almost plodding fidelity, but\r\noccasionally he makes additions which are eminently characteristic. His\r\nauthor having remarked:--\"Il nest an Jour Duy nulle chose qui tant\r\ngrieue Rome ne ytalie com~e fait le college Des notaires publiques Car\r\nilz ne sont mie en accort ensemble\"--Caxton improves the passage thus:--\r\n\r\n   \"For ther is no thynge at this day that so moche greueth rome and\r\n   Italye as doth the college of notaries and aduocates publicque. For\r\n   they ben not of oon a corde/ Alas and in Engeland what hurte doon the\r\n   aduocats. men of law. And attorneyes of court to the comyn peple of\r\n   y'e royame as well in the spirituell lawe as in the temporall/ how\r\n   torne they the lawe and statutes at their pleasir/ how ete they the\r\n   peple/ how enpouere they the comynte/ I suppose that in alle\r\n   Cristendom ar not so many pletars attorneys and men of the lawe as\r\n   ben in englond onely/ for yf they were nombrid all that lange to the\r\n   courtes of the channcery kinges benche. comyn place. cheker. ressayt\r\n   and helle And the bagge berars of the same/ hit shold amounte to a\r\n   grete multitude And how alle thyse lyue & of whome. yf hit shold be\r\n   vttrid & told/ hit shold not be beleuyd. For they entende to theyr\r\n   synguler wele and prouffyt and not to the comyn/\"\r\n\r\nAnother addition is the brief passage in the first chapter of the fourth\r\ntract in which the \"good old times\" are lamented and contrasted with the\r\ndecadence of the then present--now the four centuries past.\r\n\r\n   \"Alas what haboundance was some tymes in the royames. And what\r\n   prosþite/ In whiche was Iustice/ And euery man in his office\r\n   contente/ how stood the cytees that tyme in worship and renome/ how\r\n   was renomed the noble royame of Englond Alle the world dredde hit And\r\n   spack worship of hit/ how hit now standeth and in what haboundance I\r\n   reporte me to them that knowe hit yf ther ben theeuis wyth in the\r\n   royame or on the see/ they knowe that laboure in the royame And sayle\r\n   on the see I wote well the same is grete therof I pray god saue that\r\n   noble royame And sende good true and politicque counceyllours to the\r\n   gouernours of the same &c./\"\r\n\r\nThe concluding paragraph of the book is also due to Caxton.\r\n\r\n   \"And therfore my ryght redoubted lord I pray almighty god to saue the\r\n   kyng our souerain lord & to gyue hym grace to yssue as a kynge &\r\n   tabounde in all vertues/ & to be assisted with all other his lordes\r\n   in such wyse y't his noble royame of Englond may prospere & habounde\r\n   in vertues/ and y't synne may be eschewid iuftice kepte/ the royame\r\n   defended good men rewarded malefactours punysshid & the ydle peple to\r\n   be put to laboure that he wyth the nobles of the royame may regne\r\n   gloriously In conquerynge his rightfull enheritaunce/ that verray\r\n   peas and charite may endure in bothe his royames/ and that\r\n   marchandise may haue his cours in suche wise that euery man eschewe\r\n   synne/ and encrece in vertuous occupacions/ Praynge your good grace\r\n   to resseyue this lityll and symple book made vnder the hope and\r\n   shadowe of your noble protection by hym that is your most humble\r\n   seruant/ in gree and thanke And I shall praye almighty god for your\r\n   longe lyf & welfare/ whiche he preferue And sende yow\r\n   thaccomplisshement of your hye noble.

Details of MSS. have not been thought\r\nnecessary. They have been amply described by Dr. Van der Linde. The\r\ntreatise on the rule of princes of Colonna has been taken as furnishing\r\nthe matter which Jacques de Cessoles afterwards re-arranged under the\r\nattractive form of a description of the game of chess. The editions of\r\nthe Latin text are followed by particulars of the translations into\r\nFrench, English, Spanish, Italian, and other languages.

Bath, Isaac Pitman, James Davies. 1872 [1879].\r\n\r\nThe printing of this book began in 1872, when the title-page and earlier\r\nsheets were worked, but it was not finished until May, 1879. This is the\r\nsecond time that Mr. Pitman has printed the Chess-book in his reformed\r\northography. The first issue was in 1855. Although the title-page\r\nrepeats the old belief that \"The Game of Chess\" was the first book\r\nprinted in England, and gives the date of 1474, it is really a reprint\r\nof the second edition of Caxton.\r\n\r\n(_Sloane's version_.)\r\n\r\nThe Buke of the Chesse. Auchinleck Press. 1818. 4to.\r\n\r\nThis is printed from a MS. which is believed to have been written about\r\nthe beginning of the sixteenth century. The work is in verse, and ends:\r\n\"Heir endis y'e buke of y'e Chess, Script per manu Jhois Sloane.\" Only\r\nforty copies were reprinted by Sir Alexander Boswell at the\r\nAuchinleck Press.\r\n\r\n(_Linde. Lowndes_.)\r\n\r\nThe \"Game and Play of the Chess\" is an interesting specimen of mediæval\r\nEnglish literature. It is so near our own time that the language\r\nprefents few difficulties, in spite of its many Gallicisms, and yet it\r\nis so remote as to seem like the echo of an unknown world. The\r\ndistinctly dogmatic portions of the book are but few, and their paucity\r\nis indeed a matter of some surprise, since it is in effect a detailed\r\ntreatise on practical ethics, and is, in part if not wholly,\r\nsystematized from the discourses of one distinguished preacher, who had\r\nborrowed much of his matter from another eminent ecclesiastic. The\r\nauthor aims not at the enforcement of doctrine, but at the guidance of\r\nlife, though he no doubt assumes that his hearers are all faithful and\r\northodox sons of the Church.[22]\r\n\r\nThe ideal of the commonwealth of the middle ages finds an interesting\r\nexpression. The sharp lines of demarcation between class and class are\r\nstated with the frankness that comes of a belief that the then existing\r\nsocial fabric was the only one possible in the best of worlds. There is\r\nno doubt in the author's mind as to the rightful position of king and\r\nbaron, of bishp and merchant. The \"rights of man\" had not been invented,\r\napparently, and the maxim that the king reigns but does not govern,\r\nwould have perplexed the souls of Cessoles and his translators. They had\r\nno more doubt as to the divine right of the monarch, than the Thibetan\r\nhas of the divine right of the grand lama. The Buddhist thinks he has\r\nsecured the continuous re-appearance of supernatural wisdom in human\r\nform, and the regular transmission of political ability in the same\r\nfamily was the ideal for which the devotees of mediæval despotism had to\r\nhope. Nothing could be further from the aspirations of our author than a\r\nrace of mere palace kings seeking enjoyment only in self-indulgence. The\r\nking was to be the ruler and leader of his people. The relation and\r\ninterdependence of the several classes is emphatically proclaimed, and\r\nthe claims of duty are urged upon each.\r\n\r\nThe book enables us to gauge the literary culture of the thirteenth,\r\nfourteenth, and fifteenth centuries. Poor as it may now seem, it\r\nbelonged, in those days, to the \"literature of power,\" and had great\r\ninfluence. The form is one which lent itself readily to poetic and\r\nhistoric illustration, and indeed demanded such treatment. The authors\r\nand translators were chiefly learned and distinguifhed ecclesiastics.\r\nCaxton, the representative of the new time when literature was to be the\r\ncommon heritage, was filled to overflowing with the best literature then\r\naccessible. A writer of the present century, probably borrowing his\r\nsentiment, has defined originality to be undetected imitation. Such\r\nrefinements were unknown to Cessoles and his contemporaries. A writer\r\ntook whatever suited his purpose from any and every source that was open\r\nto him. A quotation was always as good as an original sentiment, and\r\nsometimes much better. Why should a man take the trouble of laboriously\r\ninventing fresh phrases about usury or uncleanness when there were the\r\nvery words of St. Augustine or St. Basil ready to hand? Why seek modern\r\ninstances when the great storehouse of anecdotes of Valerius Maximus was\r\nready to be rifled? Very frequently the author is given, mostly it may\r\nbe imagined from a sense of the value of the authority of the names thus\r\ncited. Whatever the intention of the writer, the effect is to show us\r\nwhat were the authors known, studied, and quoted in the middle ages.\r\n\r\nThe authors named are:--Saint Ambrose (2 references), Anastasius (1),\r\nAvicenna (2), Saint Augustine (9), Saint Basil (1), Saint Bernard (2),\r\nBoethius (3), Cassiodorus (1), Cato (5), Cicero (6), Claudian (2),\r\n\"Crete\" (1), Diomedes (1), Florus (1), Galen (1), Helinand (4),\r\nHippocrates (4), Homer (1), Saint Jerome (3), John the Monk (1),\r\nJosephus (4), Livy (2), Lucan (1), Macrobius (1), Martial (1), Ovid (6),\r\nPaulus Diaconus (1), Petrus Alphonsus (2), Plato (4), Quintilian (3),\r\nSallust (1), Seneca (15), Sidrac (1), Solinus (1), Symmachus (1),\r\nTheophrastus (1), \"Truphes of the Philosophers\" (2), Turgeius Pompeius\r\n(1), Valerius Maximus (23), Valerian (7), Varro (1), Virgil (2), \"Vitas\r\nPatrum\" (2).\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the great classical writers are but poorly\r\nrepresented, and the main dependence has been upon the later essayists,\r\nand chiefly upon Valerius Maximus, who has pointed many of the morals\r\nenforced in this book. It may, perhaps, be doubted if the writer had\r\nmore to work from than Valerius, Seneca, and St. Augustine, with\r\noccasional quotations such as memory would supply from other sources.\r\nThe verification of all these quotations would not repay the labour it\r\nwould involve; but in most cases where the experiment has been tried,\r\nthe result has been fairly creditable to the old author.\r\n\r\nThe biblical allusions may be taken as typical. There are references to\r\nthe \"bible,\" \"holy scripture,\" \"Ecclesiastes,\" and \"Canticles.\" There\r\nalso occur the names of Adam, Eve, Abel, Cain, Noah, Ham, Lot, David,\r\nAbner, Joab, Abishai, Solomon, Isaiah, Evilmerodach, Belshazzar, Darius,\r\nCyrus, Tobias, John the Baptist, and Paul. The citations are not all\r\nliterally exact. Solomon had not a very good opinion of his fellow-men;\r\nbut the comprehensive estimate of the number of fools with which he is\r\ncredited on p. 3 is not to be found in the writings canonically\r\nattributed to him. The quotation from the Canticles on p. 25 may be\r\ncompared with the translation in the Wicliffite verfion made by Nicholas\r\nde Hereford, A. D. 1380. This passage is rendered: \"His left hond is\r\nvndur myn heed; and his ri3t hond shal biclippe me\" (\"Song of Solomon,\"\r\nii. 6). Clip is still current in Lancashire, in the sense of embrace.\r\n\r\nThe extract from St. Paul, with which the prologue to the second edition\r\nopens, is no doubt intended for the following passage: \"All Scripture is\r\ngiven by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for\r\nreproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness\" (2 Tim.\r\niii. 16).\r\n\r\nIn the reference to the Athenians (p. 16), we seem to hear an echo of\r\nthe words: \"For all the Athenians and strangers that were there spent\r\ntheir time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing\r\n\" (Acts xvii. 21).\r\n\r\nThe most curious reference to a biblical personage is that relating to\r\nEvilmerodach (p. 10). Cessoles seems to have been the first to associate\r\nthe name of the son of Nebuchadnezzar with the invention of the game of\r\nchess. The biblical references to Evilmerodach are few; they throw no\r\nlight on the reason of his selection by the mediæval scribe for a bad\r\npre-eminence of parricide. The epithet of _joli_ applied to the king has\r\nan odd effect, followed as it is by the narrative of his most unfilial\r\nconduct. Dr. Van der Linde shows how widely the legend spread. Lydgate\r\nevidently hesitates between the divided authority of Guido--that is,\r\nColonna, the author of the Troy book--and Cessoles, whom he quotes\r\nthrough Jacobus de Vitriaco.[23]\r\n\r\nAmongst the authors not identified are \"Crete\" (p. 133), and Diomedes\r\n(p. 10). The account of the origin of chess attributed to the last is\r\namplified a little further on. The legend that Palamedes invented a game\r\nof this kind at the siege of Troy is emphatically rejected by our\r\nauthor, who pins his fame on Xerxes, a Greek philosopher! This became\r\nthe received opinion, as may be gathered from the unhesitating language\r\nof Polydore Vergil in a passage which is thus rendered by John\r\nLangley:--\"The chesse were invented the year of the world 3635, by a\r\ncertain Wise man called Xerxes, to declare to a Tyrant, that Majesty or\r\nAuthority without strength, assistance & help of his subjects, was\r\ncasual feeble & subject to many calamities of fortune; his intent was to\r\nbreak the fierce cruelty of his heart, by fear of such dangers as might\r\ncome to passe in the life of man.\" [24]\r\n\r\nThe curious treatise which contains the supposed conversations of King\r\nBocchus and the philosopher Sidrac (p. 171) was a favourite science book\r\nof the middle ages. It is probably of oriental origin, but there are\r\neditions in Latin, French, German, Flemish, Dutch, Italian, and English.\r\nBy way of question and answer very decided statements are made on a wide\r\nvariety of topics of which the author was profoundly ignorant. The\r\nparticular part referred to by Cessoles is chap, cclxxxi: \"Pourquoy\r\nsacostent les hommes charnellement aux femmes grosses et les bestes ne\r\nle font pas?\"[25] John the Monk (p. 70) is the noted canonist Giovanni\r\nAndrea, who died at the plague of Bologna in 1347. His learning gained\r\nhim such titles as _rabbi doctorum_ and _normaque morum_. His\r\ncommentaries on the decretals were frequently reprinted. He gave the\r\nname of \"Novellæ\" to this work after the name of his mother and\r\ndaughter. His code of morality contained no prohibition of literary\r\ntheft, for his additions to the \"Speculum Juris\" of Durand are said to\r\nhave been taken bodily from Oddrale. In the same magnificent manner he\r\nappropriated the treatise \"De Sponsalibus et Matrimonio\" of Anguissola.\r\nHis daughter Novella was a learned woman, and became the wife of\r\nGiovanni Calderino, a jurist of Bologna. Their son, Gaspard Calderino,\r\nwrote a commentary on the decretals. Father, daughter, son-in-law, and\r\ngrandson appear to have all been experts in the canon law.[26]\r\n\r\nThe reference to the \"first book of the Truphes of the Philosophers by\r\nfigure\" does not convey a very definite idea as to the particular work\r\nintended. It must have been somewhat miscellaneous in character, for one\r\nextract describes the fountain of the syrens (p. 122), and the other is\r\nan anecdote, which though told here of Julius Cæsar (p. 71), is really\r\nthe story of the soldier who had fought at Actium with Augustus Cæsar.\r\nIt occurs also in the \"Gesta Romanorum,\" where the emperor is\r\nnamed Agyos.\r\n\r\n\"Helmond\" (p. 33, &c.) is intended for Helinand, who died some time\r\nafter 1229. After a brilliant period at the court of Philip Augustus,\r\nwhere he is represented as reciting his heroic verses before the king\r\nand his surrounding, he became a monk of the Cistercian Abbey of\r\nFroidmont. One of his surviving poems deals with the melancholy subject\r\nof death. The \"Flores Helinandi\" are said to have been popular as well\r\nas his \"Chronique.\" He is also the reputed author of some sermons, and\r\nof the life of St. Gereon, published by the Bollandists, and of other\r\nworks still inedited. He is sometimes confounded with another French\r\nmonk of the same name, who lived in the eleventh century, and was an\r\ninmate of the monastery at Persigne in Maine. This second Helinand was\r\nthe author of commentaries or glosses on the Apocalypse and Exodus.[27]\r\nThe first-named has been credited with the authorship of \"Gesta\r\nRomanorum.\" The grounds for this are very slight. \"On a longtemps ignoré\r\nle nom de l'auteur de cette compilation, mais un passage du 68^e\r\ndialogue du livre intitulé 'Dialogus creaturarum' nous le révele par ces\r\nmots: _Elimandus in gestis romanorum_.\"[28] But, as Sir F. Madden and\r\nMr. Herrtage have pointed out, the name of \"Gesta Romanorum\" was given\r\nto any book treating of Roman affairs. A French translation of Livy, by\r\nRobert Gaguin, has been catalogued as a version of the \"Gesta.\" The\r\nreference cited by Brunet is to the Chroniques of Helinand.[29]\r\n\r\nMany of the stories and anecdotes are the commonplaces of ancient\r\nhistory, such as the friendship of Damon and Pythias, the sword of\r\nDamocles, the chastity of Scipio, the magnanimity of Alexander, the\r\nfable of the Dog and the Shadow, &c. Others current in the middle ages\r\nhad great popularity, and even in our own days occasionally renew their\r\nyouth. The story of John of Ganazath (p. 48) is to be found in Occleve's\r\ntranslation of Colonna. Mr. Thomas Wright remarks: \"This story, under\r\ndifferent forms, was a very common one in the middle ages. One version\r\nwill be found in my 'Latin Stories,' p. 28. It will hardly be necessary\r\nto remark that the story of King Lear and his daughters is another\r\nversion.\"[30]\r\n\r\nThe story appears also in some modern compilations. In one instance it\r\nis given as the will of Jehan Connaxa, of Antwerp, about 1530.[31] The\r\nincident is given in the following form in the popular collection known\r\nas the \"Percy Anecdotes\":[32]--\r\n\r\n\"An eminent trader at Lyons, who had acquired an easy fortune, had two\r\nhandsome daughters, between whom, on their marriage, he divided all his\r\nproperty, on condition that he should pass the summer with one and the\r\nwinter with the other. Before the end of the first year, he found\r\nsufficient grounds to conclude that he was not a very acceptable guest\r\nto either; of this, however, he took no notice, but hired a handsome\r\nlodging, in which he resided a few weeks; he then applied to a friend,\r\nand told him the truth of the matter, desiring the gift of two hundred\r\nlivres, and the loan of fifty thousand, in ready money, for a few hours.\r\nHis friend very readily complied with his request; and the next day the\r\nold gentleman made a very splendid entertainment, to which his daughters\r\nand their husbands were invited. Just as dinner was over, his friend\r\ncame in a great hurry; told him of an unexpected demand upon him, and\r\ndesired to know whether he could lend him fifty thousand livres. The old\r\nman told him, without any emotion, that twice as much was at his\r\nservice, if he wanted it; and going into the next room, brought him the\r\nmoney. After this, he was not suffered to stay any longer in lodgings;\r\nhis daughters were jealous if he stayed a day more in one house than the\r\nother; and after three or four years spent with them, he died; when,\r\nupon examining his cabinet, inftead of livres, there was found a note\r\ncontaining these words: 'He who has suffered by his virtues, has a right\r\nto avail himself of the vices of those by whom he has been injured; and\r\na father ought never to be so fond of his children as to forget what is\r\ndue to himself.'\"\r\n\r\nAmongst other versions of the story is a novelle by Giovanni Brevio,\r\npublished as part of his \"Rime\" in 1545. Piron's comedy of \"Les Fils\r\nIngrats,\" also known as \"L'Ecole des Pères,\" appeared in 1728. \"The\r\nstory,\" adds Dunlop, \"is also told in the 'Pieuses Recreations d'Angelin\r\nGazée,' and is told in the 'Colloquia Mensalia' of Luther, among other\r\nexamples to deter fathers from dividing their property during life among\r\ntheir children--a practice to which they are in general little\r\naddicted.\"[33]\r\n\r\nThere is yet another verfion of the story in John of Bromyard's \"Summa\r\nPredicantium.\" After describing the discovery of the club it says, \"in\r\nquo Anglice scriptum erat\"--\r\n\r\n    \"Wyht fuyle a betel be he smetyn,\r\n    That al the werld hyt mote wyten,\r\n    That gyfht his sone al his thing,\r\n    And goht hym self a beggyn.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wright gives another version, and adds that he is inclined to think\r\nthat the story and verses had some connection with \"a superstition not\r\nyet forgotten, which is thus told by Aubrey in his 'Remains of Gentilism'\"\r\n(Thorn's \"Anecdotes and Traditions,\" p. 84)--\"The Holy Mawle, which\r\nthey fancy was hung behind the church door, which when the father was\r\nseaventie, the sonne might fetch to knock his father in the head, as\r\neffete and of no more use.\"[34]\r\n\r\nHerodotus has attributed the same unfilial conduct to some Indian\r\ntribes.\r\n\r\nThe incident of St. Bernard playing at dice for a soul (p. 151), is in\r\nthe \"Gesta Romanorum.\" The anecdote how a son induced his father to\r\nbecome a monk (p. 81) which is quoted from the \"Vitas Patrum\" is also in\r\nthe \"Gesta Romanorum,\" and has so much of the Buddhist flavour as to\r\ngive rise to the suspicion that it comes from an Oriental source.[35]\r\nThe story of two merchants quoted from Petrus Alphonsus is also in the\r\n\"Gesta Romanorum.\" It is the foundation of Lydgate's \"Two Friends,\" and\r\nis beyond doubt an Eastern importation. In a MS. of the \"Speculum\r\nLaicorum,\" described by Prof. Ingram, the writer has transformed one of\r\nthe merchants into an Englishman.[36]\r\n\r\nThe story quoted from \"Paul, the historiagraph of the Lombards\" (p. 46),\r\nis also given in the \"Gesta Romanorum.\" Mr. Herrtage says it is\r\n\"evidently founded on the classical legend of Tarpeia.\" The narrative in\r\nthe chess-book is taken from Paulus Diaconus.[37]\r\n\r\nThe stratagem by which deposited money was recovered from a dishonest\r\ntrustee (p. 114) is told by Petrus Alphonsus, and is also in the \"Gesta\r\nRomanorum.\"\r\n\r\nThe story of the danger of drunkenness (p. 129) was a favourite with our\r\nforefathers. It is given by John of Bromyard, and is the subject of a\r\nfabliau which is given by Meon.[38]\r\n\r\nThe somewhat violent remedy recorded as having been adopted by\r\nDemosthenes (p. 103) will remind some readers of a passage in the life\r\nof St. Francis of Assisi. \"He had given up,\" says Mrs. Oliphant,\r\n\"without hesitation, as would appear, all the indefinite sweetness of\r\nyouthful hopes. But, nevertheless, he was still young, still a man, with\r\nhuman instincts and wishes, the tenderest nature, and an imagination\r\nfull of all the warmth and grace of his age and his country. It does not\r\nappear that he ever put into words the musings which caught him\r\nunawares--the relics of old dreams or soft recollections which now and\r\nthen would steal into his heart. But one night suddenly he rose from the\r\nearthen floor which was his bed, and rushed out into the night in an\r\naccess of rage and passion and despair. A certain brother who was\r\npraying in his cell, peering, wondering, through his little window, saw\r\nhim heap together seven masses of snow in the clear moonlight. 'Here is\r\nthy wife,' he said to himself; 'these four are thy sons and daughters,\r\nthe other two are thy servant and thy handmaid; and for all these thou\r\nart bound to provide. Make haste, then, and provide clothing for them,\r\nlest they perish with cold. But if the care of so many trouble thee, be\r\nthou careful to serve our Lord alone.' Bonaventura, who tells the story,\r\ngoes on, with the true spirit of a monkish historian, to state how, 'the\r\ntempter being vanquished, departed, and the holy man returned victorious\r\nto his cell.' The piteous human yearning that is underneath this wild\r\ntale, the sudden access of self-pity and anger, mixed with a strange\r\nattempt, not less piteous than the longing, at self-consolation--all the\r\nstruggle and conflict of emotion which stilled themselves, at least for\r\na moment, by that sudden plunge into the snow, and wild, violent, bodily\r\nexertion, are either lost upon the teller of the tale, or perhaps he\r\nfears to do his master injustice by revealing any consciousness of the\r\npossibility of such thoughts. But it is a very remarkable peculiarity of\r\nFrancis's history, that whereas every saint in the Calendar, from Antony\r\ndownwards, is sometimes troubled with visions of voluptuous delight,\r\nonly Francis, in his pure dreams, is tempted by the modest joys of wife\r\nand children--the most legitimate and tenderest love.\"[39]\r\n\r\nThe reader must not expect any historical exactitude or critical spirit\r\nfrom our author. For his purpose a narrative was just as useful whether\r\ntrue or false, but it probably never occurred to him to question the\r\nexact truth of any statement that he found written in a book. The murder\r\nof Seneca (p. 9) is certainly not the least of the many crimes which\r\nstain the memory of Nero, but the circumstances of his death are not\r\nexactly described by the mediæval scribe. Whether the philosopher and\r\nformer tutor was implicated in the conspiracy of Piso may be doubted,\r\nbut some ambiguous phrases he had used were reported to the Emþeror,\r\nwhose messenger demanded an explanation of their meaning. The reply of\r\nSeneca was either unsatisfactory or the tyrant had decided to be rid of\r\nhis former guide. As in more recent times in Japan the condemned man was\r\nexpected to be his own executioner, and Seneca opened his veins and\r\nallowed the life to ooze from them with a stoicism that was certainly\r\nheroic if not untainted by theatrical display. The character of Seneca\r\nwill ever remain one of the puzzles of history, for the grave moralist\r\nwas accessory to the murder of Agrippina, and not unsuspected of\r\nlicentiousness, and of the accumulation of an enormous fortune of three\r\nhundred million sestertii by injustice and fraud. The statements of Dion\r\nCassius as to the misdeeds of the philosopher must be weighed against\r\nthe absence of any condemnation of his proceedings in the pages\r\nof Tacitus.\r\n\r\nThe Theodore Cerem named on p. 12, is Theodorus Cyrenaicus, who was\r\nprobably a native of Cyrene, and a disciple of Aristippus. He was\r\nbanished from the (supposed) place of his birth, and was shielded at\r\nAthens by Demetrius Phalerus, whose exile he is assumed to have shared.\r\nWhilst in the service of Egypt he was sent as an ambassador to\r\nLysimachus, whom he offended by the directness and plainness of his\r\nspeech. The offended monarch threatened him with crucifixion, and he\r\nreplied in a phrase which became famous, \"Threaten thus your courtiers,\r\nfor it matters not to me whether I rot on the ground or in the air.\"[40]\r\nThe king's threat was not executed, as Theodorus was afterwards at\r\nCorinth, and is believed to have died at Cyrene. That he was condemned\r\nto drink hemlock is a statement cited from Amphicrates by Diogenes\r\nLærtius (_Aristippus_, xv.). The anecdote of his colloquy with\r\nLysimachus would easily be perverted into a belief that he had been put\r\nto death for the freedom with which he exercised his biting wit.\r\n\r\nThe Democreon mentioned at pp. 12 and 16 is Democritus of Abdera, of\r\nwhom the anecdote is told. He was a man whose knowledge and wisdom won\r\neven the respect of Timon, the universal scoffer. The tradition that he\r\ndeprived himself of sight with a view to philosophic abstraction is\r\nmentioned by Cicero, Aulus Gellius, and others, but it is hardly\r\nnecessary to account for a too uncommon calamity by a supposition so\r\nremarkable.\r\n\r\nThe transformations of some of the names are peculiar. At p. 12 we read\r\nof Defortes. The philosopher disguised under this strange name appears\r\nto be Socrates. The story is told in the Apology of Socrates attributed\r\nto Xenophon. The person to whom the saying was addressed was not\r\nXanthippe, but was a disciple named Apollodorus, whose understanding was\r\nnot equal to his admiration.\r\n\r\nThe statement that Didymus voluntarily blinded himself is made both by\r\nJerome (_Ep_. 68) and in the Ecclesiastical History of Socrates (iv.\r\n29). Didymus was born 309 or 314, and became blind at the age of four,\r\nas the result of disease. He learned the alphabet by wooden letters, and\r\nby application and force of character became learned in all the learning\r\nof his time. Is this a real anticipation of the use of raised letters\r\nfor the blind? What would be the use of a knowledge of the alphabet so\r\nacquired in obtaining that skill in geometry, rhetoric, arithmetic, and\r\nmusic for which he was famous? He owed to Athanasius his position as\r\nhead of the Catechetical School of Alexandria.\r\n\r\nThe readers of \"Cymbeline\" will remember the passage in the concluding\r\nscene:--\r\n\r\n    \"The piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter,\r\n    Which we call _mollis ær_; and _mollis ær_\r\n    We term it _mulier_; which mulier, I divine,\r\n    Is this most constant wife: who even now,\r\n    Answering the letter of the oracle,\r\n    Unknown to you unsought, were clipp'd about\r\n    With this most tender air.\"\r\n\r\nThis quaint piece of etymology will be found at p. 123 of the present\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\nThere is an interesting personal reference in the following passage\r\nwhich has not, it is believed, been pointed out:--\r\n\r\n\"And also hit is to be supposyd that suche as haue theyr goodes comune &\r\nnot propre is most acceptable to god/ For ellys wold not thise religious\r\nmen as monkes freris chanons obseruantes & all other auowe hem & kepe\r\nthe wilfull pouerte that they ben professid too/ For in trouth I haue my\r\nself ben conuersant in a religious hous of white freris at gaunt Which\r\nhaue all thynge in comyn amonge them/ and not one richer than an other/\r\nin so moche that yf a man gaf to a frere .iii.d or iiii.d to praye for\r\nhym in his masse/ as sone as the masse is doon he deliuerith hit to his\r\nouerest or procuratour in whyche hows ben many vertuous and deuoute\r\nfreris And yf that lyf were not the beste and the most holiest/ holy\r\nchurch wold neuer suffre hit in religion.\"\r\n\r\nThis description by the busy merchant of the \"best life\" might serve to\r\npoint anew the distinction between the real and the ideal, and perhaps\r\nnot to the advantage of the latter.\r\n\r\nNothing has yet been said as to the place of this book in the history of\r\nchess, and, indeed, it must be confessed that it has very little\r\npractical bearing on the game. The learned dreams by which the chess of\r\nto-day was connected with the _latrunculi_ and with the amusement said\r\nto have been invented by Palamedes, have been dissipated by the cool air\r\nof modern criticism. The student of the history of chess may now follow\r\nits fortunes under the safe guidance of Dr. van der Linde, who rejects\r\nunhesitatingly the claim made for it, and admitted even by Forbes, of an\r\nantiquity of 5,000 years.[41] The game of chess, which, whilst remaining\r\nan amusement, has acquired the dignity of a science, is one that Europe\r\nowes to India, where it was probably invented not earlier than five\r\ncenturies before Christ; the triumphant progress of Islam aided in the\r\nextension of this oriental pastime. It was known at the courts of\r\nNicephorus at Conftantinople and his contemporary Haroun-al-Rashid at\r\nBagdad. One would like to add that Charlemagne also was acquainted with\r\nit, but there is no good evidence for that legend. It was known in Spain\r\nin the tenth century, since the library of the learned caliph Hakam II.\r\nof Cordova contained some Arabic MSS. on the game. By the middle of the\r\neleventh century it was common in the western world. In 1061 a\r\nFlorentine bishop is said to have been ordered by Cardinal Damiani to\r\nexpiate the offence of playing chess in public by three recitations of\r\nthe Psalter, by washing the feet of twelve poor persons, and by giving\r\nthem liberal alms. The gradual developments of the game in Europe are\r\nillustrated in detail by Dr. van der Linde. Chess in its prefent form is\r\ncomparatively modern, and refults from the enlargement of the powers of\r\nthe Queen (originally the Vizier or minister) and of the Bishop\r\n(formerly the Alfil or Elephant). The greater powers of these pieces\r\ncame into play between 1450 and 1500, but the period of transition was\r\nprolonged to a much later date in some cafes, and the Portuguese Damiano\r\nmay be regarded as the founder of the modern school. The player of\r\nto-day on consulting the elementary directions given in this book (p.\r\n159, _et seq_.), will see how greatly the present play exceeds in\r\ncomplexity and scientific interest the moves that excited the enthusiasm\r\nof Jacobus de Cessoles, and led him to the composition of the book of\r\nthe chess which has had such long and widespread popularity.\r\n\r\nIncidentally his book is a monument in the history of chess, but it was\r\nnever intended to make its primary object that of teaching the game. The\r\nauthor's aim was almost exclusively ethical. It was to win men to a\r\nsober life and to the due performance of individual and social duties,\r\nthat the preacher exhausted his stores of learning, and invoked alike\r\nthe reproofs of the fathers of the Church, the history and legend of\r\nchroniclers, pagan and Christian, and the words of prophets and poets.\r\nAs a memorial of the literature and learning of the middle ages, it must\r\nalways possess a permanent value. From it we may learn, and always with\r\ninterest, what was the literary taste and social ideal of the\r\nthirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries. There is, doubtless,\r\nample room for dissatisfaction with that ideal, but it is not without\r\nsome bright aspects. Possibly there are modern realms that are not any\r\nhappier now than they would be if governed in strict accordance with the\r\nrules laid down by the earnest author of the game and play of the chess.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt only remains for the editor to thank the friends who have interested\r\nthemselves in his work. Mr. J.E. Bailey, F.S.A., has shown his usual\r\nscholarly courtesy and liberality in the communication of books and\r\nreferences. To Mr. R.C. Christie, the Chancellor of the Diocese of\r\nManchester, a similar acknowledgment is due. Mr. C.W. Sutton, and Mr.\r\nW.R.

This philosopher was so\r\nJuste and trewe that he had leuyr dye/ than to lyue longe and be a fals\r\nflaterer wyth the sayd kynge. For whan he behelde the foull and synfull\r\nlyf of the kynge/ And that no man durst blame hym. For by his grete\r\ncruelte he putte them alle to deth that displesid hym/ he put hym self\r\nin paryll of deth/ And louyd and chees rather to dye than lenger to\r\nlyue: The euyll lyf and diffamed of a kynge is the lyf of a cruell\r\nbeste/ And ought not longe to be susteyned/ For he destroyeth hym that\r\ndisplesith hym/ And therfore reherceth valerius/ that ther was a wise\r\nman named theodore cerem whom his kynge dyde do hange on the crosse for\r\nas moche as he repreuyd hym of his euyll & fowll lyf And all way as he\r\nwas in the torment he said to y'e kynge/ upon thy counceyllours & them\r\nthat ben cladd in thy clothynge & robes were more reson that this\r\ntorment shold come/ For as moche as they dar not saye to the The trouthe\r\nfor to do Justice right wysly/ of my self I make no force whether I dye\r\non the lande or on the water or otherwyse &c as who sayth he recched not\r\nto dye for Justice/ In lyke wyse as democreon the philosophre put out\r\nhis owen eyen be cause he wold not see that no good myght come to the\r\neuyll and vicyous peple wyth out right And also defortes the philosophre\r\nas he went toward his deth/ his wyf that folowed after hym saide that he\r\nwas dampned to deth wrongfully/ than he answerd and sayd to her/ holde\r\nthy peas and be styll/ hit is better and more merytorye to dye by a\r\nwronge and unrightfull Jugement/ than that I had deseruyd to dye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration.]\r\n\r\n_The thirde chapitre of the first tractate treteth wherfore the playe\r\nwas founden and maad._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe causes wherfore this playe was founden ben thre/ the first was for\r\nto correcte and repreue the kynge .For whan this kynge Evilmerodach sawe\r\nthis playe And the barons knyghtes and gentillmen of his court playe\r\nwyth the philosopher/ he meruaylled gretly of the beaulte and nouelte of\r\nthe playe/ And desired to playe agaynst y'e philosopher/ The philosopher\r\nanswerd and sayd to hym that hit myght not be doon. But yf he first\r\nlerned the playe/ The kynge said hit was reson and that he wold put him\r\nto the payne to lerne hit Than the philosopher began to teche hym and to\r\nshewe hym the maner of the table of the chesse borde and the chesse\r\nmeyne/ And also the maners and condicions of a kynge of the nobles and\r\nof the comun peple and of theyr offices and how they shold be touchid\r\nand drawen. And how he shold amende hymself & become vertuous And whan\r\nthis kynge herde that he repreuyd hym/ He demanded hym upon payne of\r\ndeth to tell hym wherfore he had founden and made this playe/ And he\r\nanswerd my ryght dere lord and kynge/ the grettest and most thinge that\r\nI desire is that thou haue in thy self a gloryous and vertuous lyf And\r\nthat may I not see/ but yf thou be endoctrined and well manerd and that\r\nhad/ so mayst thou be belouyd of thy peple Thus than I desire y't thou\r\nhaue other gouernement than thou hast had/ And that thou haue upon thy\r\nself first seygnorye and maistrye suche as thou hast upon other by force\r\nand not by right Certaynly hit is not ryght that a man be mayster ouer\r\nother and comandour/ whan he can not rewle ner may rewle himself and\r\nthat his vertues domyne aboue his vices/. For seygnourye by force and\r\nwylle may not longe endure/ Than thus may thou see oon of the causes why\r\nand wherfore I haue founden and maad thys playe/ whyche is for to\r\ncorrecte and repent the of thy tyrannye and vicyous lyuynge/ .For alle\r\nkynges specyally ought to here her corrygeours or correctours and her\r\ncorrections to hold and kepe in mynde/ In lyke wyse as Valerius\r\nreherceth that the kynge Alixandre had a noble and renomed knyght that\r\nsayd in repreuynge of Alixandre that he was to moche couetous and in\r\nespecyall of the honours of the world/ And sayd to hym yf the goddes had\r\nmaad thy body as greet as is thy herte Alle the world coude not holde\r\nthe/. For thou holdest in thy right hand alle the Oryent/ And in thy\r\nlyfte hande the occident/ syn than hit is so/ or thou art a god or a man\r\nor nought/ yf thou be god doo than well and good to the peple as god\r\ndoth/ And take not from them that they ought to haue and is theyres. yf\r\nthou be a man/ thinke that thou shalt dye/ And than thou shalt doo noon\r\neuyll/ yf thou be nought forgete thy self/ ther is no thynge so stronge\r\nand ferme/ but that somtyme a feble thinge casteth doun and ouerthrowe\r\nhit How well that the lyon be the strengest beste/ yet somtyme a lityll\r\nbirde eteth hym/ The seconde cause wherfore this playe was founden and\r\nmaad/ was for to kepe hym from ydlenesse/ whereof senecque saith unto\r\nlucylle ydlenes wyth oute ony ocupacion is sepulture of a man lyuyng/\r\nand varro saith in his sentences that in lyke wise as men goo not for to\r\ngoo/ the same wyse the lyf is not gyuen for to lyue but for to doo well\r\nand good/ And therfore secondly the philosopher fonde this playe for to\r\nkepe the peple from ydlenes/. For there is moche peple. Whan so is that\r\nthey be fortunat in worldly goodes that they drawe them to ease and\r\nydlenes wherof cometh ofte tymes many euyllys and grete synnes And by\r\nthis ydlenes the herte is quenchid wherof cometh desperacion/ The thirde\r\ncause is that euery man naturelly desireth to knowe and to here\r\nnoueltees and tydynges. For this cause they of atthenes studyed as we\r\nrede/ and for as the corporall or bodyly fight enpessheth and letteth\r\notherwhyle the knowleche of subtyll thinges/ therfore we rede that [48]\r\ndemocrion the phylosopher put oute his owen eyen/ for as moche as he\r\nmyght haue the better entendement and understondynge/ Many haue ben made\r\nblynde that were grete clerkis in lyke wyse as was dydymus bisshop of\r\nAlixandrye/ that how well that he sawe not yet he was so grete a clerk/\r\nthat gregore nazan & saynt Ierome that were clerkes and maystres to\r\nother/ came for to be his scolers & lerned of hym And saynt Anthonie The\r\ngrete heremyte cam for to see hym on a tyme/ and amonge all other\r\nthynges/ he demanded hym yf he were not gretly displesid that he was\r\nblynde and sawe not. And he answerd that he was gretly abasshid for that\r\nhe supposid not that he was not displesid in that he had lost his sight/\r\nAnd saynt Anthonye answerd to hym I meruayle moche that hit displesith\r\nthe that thou hast lost that thynge whiche is comyn betwene the and\r\nbestes. And thou knowest well that thou hast not loste that thynge that\r\nis comyn bitwene the and the angellis And for thise causes forsayd the\r\nphilosopher entended to put away alle pensisnes and thoughtes/ and to\r\nthinke only on this playe as shall be said & appere in this book after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_The seconde tractate/ the first chapiter treteth of the forme of a\r\nkynge of his maners and of his estate_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe kynge must be thus maad. For he must sitte in a chayer clothed in\r\npurpure/ crowned on his heed in his ryght hand a ceptre and in the lyfte\r\nhande an apple of gold/. For he is the most grettest and hyest in\r\ndignyte aboue alle other and most worthy. And that is signefyed by the\r\ncorone/. For the glorye of the peple is the dignite of the kynge/ And\r\naboue all other the kynge ought to be replenysshid with vertues and of\r\ngrace/ and thys signefieth the purpure. For in lyke wyse as the robes of\r\npurpure maketh fayr & enbelysshith the body/ the same wise vertues\r\nmaketh the sowle/ he ought alleway thenke on the gouernement of the\r\nRoyame and who hath thadmynystracion of Justice/ And thys shuld be by\r\nhym self pryncipally. This signefieth the appell of gold that he holdeth\r\nin his lyfte honde/ And for as moche as hit apperteyneth unto hym to\r\npunysshe the rebelles hath he y'e sceptre in his right hand And for as\r\nmoche as mysericorde and trouthe conserue and kepe the kynge in his\r\ntrone/ Therfore ought a kynge to be mercyfull and debonayr For whan a\r\nkynge or prynce desired or will be belouyd of his peple late hym be\r\ngouerned by debonarite And valerius saith that debonairte percyth the\r\nhertes of straungers and amolisshith and maketh softe the hertes of his\r\nenemyes/ wherof he reherceth that philostratus that was due of athenes\r\nhad a doughter/ whom a man louyd so ardantly/ that on a tyme as he sawe\r\nher wyth her moder/ sodaynly he cam and kyssed her/ wherof the moder was\r\nso angry and soroufull that she wente and requyred of her lord the duc/\r\nthat his heed myght be smyten of/ The prynce answerd to her and sayde/\r\nyf we shold slee them that loue us/ what shall we doo to our enemyes\r\nthat hate us/ Certaynly this was thanswer of a noble & debonair prynce\r\nThat suffred that villonye don to his doughter and to hymself yet more\r\nThis prince had also a frende that was named Arispe that sayd on a tyme\r\nas moche villonye unto the prynce as ony man miht saye And that might\r\nnot suffise hym/ but he scracchid hym in the visage/ The prynce suffryd\r\nhym paciently in suche wyse as thowh he had doon to hym no vilonye but\r\ncurtoysye And whan his sones wold haue auengid this vilonye/ he comanded\r\nthem that they shold not be so hardy so to do The next day folowyng\r\narispe remembrid of the right grete vilonye that he had don to his\r\nfrende and lord wythoute cause. He fyll in dispayr and wold haue slayn\r\nhym self/ whan the duc knewe and understode that/ he cam to hym and sayd\r\nne doubte the nothynge And swore to hym by his fayth/ that also well he\r\nwas and shold be his frende fro than forthon as euery he had ben to fore\r\nyf he wold And thus he respited hym of his deth by his debonairte. And\r\nin lyke wyse rede we of the kynge pirre to whom was reported that they\r\nof tarente had said grete vilonye of hym. For whiche cause he maad alle\r\nthem to come to fore hym And demanded of them yf they had so sayd. Than\r\noon of them answerd and sayd/ yf the wyn and the candellys had not\r\nfayllyd/ thys langage had ben but a Iape/ In regarde of that we had\r\nthought to haue doon/ Than the kynge began to lawhe/ for they had\r\nconfessid that suche langage as was sayd and spoken was by dronkenship/\r\nAnd for this cause of debonairte the peple of tarante toke for a custome\r\nthat the dronken men shold be puuysshyd/ And the sobre men preyfed. The\r\nkynge than thus ought to loue humylyte and hate falsite after the holy\r\nscripture that speketh of euery man generally/ For the kynge in his\r\nroyame representeth god/ And god is verite/ And therfore hym ought to\r\nsaye no thynge but yf hit were veritable and stable. Valerius reherceth\r\nthat Alixandre wyth alle his ooste rood for to destroye a cyte whyche\r\nwas named lapsare/ whan than a phylosophre whiche had to name Anaximenes\r\nwhich had ben to fore maistre & gouernour of Alixandre herd and\r\nunderstood of his comyng Cam agayn Alixandre for to desire and requyre\r\nof hym. And whan he sawe Alixandre he supposid to haue axid his\r\nrequefte/ Alixandre brake his demande to fore and swore to hym to fore\r\nhe axid ony thynge by his goddes. That suche thynge as he axid or\r\nrequyryd of hym/ he wold in no wyse doon/ Than the philosopher requyred\r\nhym to destroye the cyte/ whan Alixandre understood his desire/ and the\r\noth that he had maad/ he suffrid the cyte to stande and not to be\r\ndestroyed For he had leuer doo his wyll than to be periured and forsworn\r\nand doo agaynst his oth/ Quyntilian saith that no grete man ne lord\r\nshold not swere/ but where as is grete nede/ And that the symple parole\r\nor worde of a prynce ought to be more stable than the oth of a\r\nmarcha[=u]t/ Alas how kepe the prynces their promisses in thise dayes/\r\nnot only her promises but their othes her fealis and wrytynges & signes\r\nof their propre handes/ alle faylleth god amende hit &c. A kynge also\r\nought to hate alle cruelte/ For we rede that neuer yet dyed ony pietous\r\npersone of euyll deth ne cruell persone of good deth Therfore recounteth\r\nvalerius that ther was a man named theryle a werke-man in metall/ that\r\nmade a boole of coppre and a lityll wyket on the side/ wherby men myght\r\nput in them that shuld be brent therin/ And hit was maad in suche\r\nmanere/ that they that shold be put and enclosid therin shold crye\r\nnothinge lyke to the wys of a man but of an oxe. And this made he be\r\ncause men shold haue the lasse pite of them.
