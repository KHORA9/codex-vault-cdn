PARKER\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nThis book has grown out of lectures to students at the University of\r\nMichigan and embodies my effort to express to them the nature and\r\nmeaning of art. In writing it, I have sought to maintain scientific\r\naccuracy, yet at the same time to preserve freedom of style and\r\nsomething of the inspiration of the subject. While intended primarily\r\nfor students, the book will appeal generally, I hope, to people who\r\nare interested in the intelligent appreciation of art.\r\n\r\nMy obligations are extensive,--most directly to those whom I have cited\r\nin foot-notes to the text, but also to others whose influence is too\r\nindirect or pervasive to make citation profitable, or too obvious to\r\nmake it necessary. For the broader philosophy of art, my debt is\r\nheaviest, I believe, to the artists and philosophers during the period\r\nfrom Herder to Hegel, who gave to the study its greatest development,\r\nand, among contemporaries, to Croce and Lipps. In addition, I have\r\ndrawn freely upon the more special investigations of recent times, but\r\nwith the caution desirable in view of the very tentative character of\r\nsome of the results. To Mrs. Robert M. Wenley I wish to express my\r\nthanks for her very careful and helpful reading of the page proof.\r\n\r\nThe appended bibliography is, of course, not intended to be in any\r\nsense adequate, but is offered merely as a guide to further reading;\r\na complete bibliography would itself demand almost a volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nCHAPTER    I.

The average man,\r\nwho may exercise considerable taste in personal adornment, in the\r\ndecoration of the home, or in the choice of poetry and painting, is\r\nat a loss when called upon to tell what art is or to explain why he\r\ncalls one thing \"beautiful\" and another \"ugly.\" Even the artist and\r\nthe connoisseur, skilled to produce or accurate in judgment, are often\r\nwanting in clear and consistent ideas about their own works or\r\nappreciations. Here, as elsewhere, we meet the contrast between feeling\r\nand doing, on the one hand, and knowing, on the other. Just as practical\r\nmen are frequently unable to describe or justify their most successful\r\nmethods or undertakings, just as many people who astonish us with their\r\nfineness and freedom in the art of living are strangely wanting in\r\nclear thoughts about themselves and the life which they lead so\r\nadmirably, so in the world of beauty, the men who do and appreciate\r\nare not always the ones who understand.\r\n\r\nVery often, moreover, the artist and the art lover justify their\r\ninability to understand beauty on the ground that beauty is too subtle\r\na thing for thought. How, they say, can one hope to distill into clear\r\nand stable ideas such a vaporous and fleeting matter as Aesthetic\r\nfeeling? Such men are not only unable to think about beauty, but\r\nskeptical as to the possibility of doing so,--contented mystics, deeply\r\nfeeling, but dumb.\r\n\r\nHowever, there have always been artists and connoisseurs who have\r\nstriven to reflect upon their appreciations and acts, unhappy until\r\nthey have understood and justified what they were doing; and one meets\r\nwith numerous art-loving people whose intellectual curiosity is rather\r\nquickened than put to sleep by just that element of elusiveness in\r\nbeauty upon which the mystics dwell. Long acquaintance with any class\r\nof objects leads naturally to the formation of some definition or\r\ngeneral idea of them, and the repeated performance of the same type\r\nof act impels to the search for a principle that can be communicated\r\nto other people in justification of what one is doing and in defense\r\nof the value which one attaches to it. Thoughtful people cannot long\r\navoid trying to formulate the relation of their interest in beauty,\r\nwhich absorbs so much energy and devotion, to other human interests,\r\nto fix its place in the scheme of life. It would be surprising,\r\ntherefore, if there had been no Shelleys or Sidneys to define the\r\nrelation between poetry and science, or Tolstoys to speculate on the\r\nnature of all art; and we should wonder if we did not everywhere hear\r\nintelligent people discussing the relation of utility and goodness to\r\nbeauty, or asking what makes a poem or a picture great.\r\n\r\nNow the science of aesthetics is an attempt to do in a systematic way\r\nwhat thoughtful art lovers have thus always been doing haphazardly.\r\nIt is an effort to obtain a clear general idea of beautiful objects,\r\nour judgments upon them, and the motives underlying the acts which\r\ncreate them,--to raise the aesthetic life, otherwise a matter of\r\ninstinct and feeling, to the level of intelligence, of understanding.\r\nTo understand art means to find an idea or definition which applies\r\nto it and to no other activity, and at the same time to determine its\r\nrelation to other elements of human nature; and our understanding will\r\nbe complete if our idea includes all the distinguishing characteristics\r\nof art, not simply enumerated, but exhibited in their achieved\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\nHow shall we proceed in seeking such an idea of art? We must follow\r\na twofold method: first, the ordinary scientific method of observation,\r\nanalysis, and experiment; and second, another and very different method,\r\nwhich people of the present day often profess to avoid, but which is\r\nequally necessary, as I shall try to show, and actually employed by\r\nthose who reject it. In following the first method we treat beautiful\r\nthings as objects given to us for study, much as plants and animals\r\nare given to the biologist. Just as the biologist watches the behavior\r\nof his specimens, analyzes them into their various parts and functions,\r\nand controls his studies through carefully devised experiments, arriving\r\nat last at a clear notion of what a plant or an animal is--at a\r\ndefinition of life; so the student of aesthetics observes works of art\r\nand other well-recognized beautiful things, analyzes their elements\r\nand the forms of connection of these, arranges experiments to facilitate\r\nand guard his observations from error and, as a result, reaches the\r\ngeneral idea for which he is looking,--the idea of beauty.\r\n\r\nA vast material presents itself for study of this kind: the artistic\r\nattempts of children and primitive men; the well-developed art of\r\ncivilized nations, past and present, as creative process and as\r\ncompleted work; and finally, the everyday aesthetic appreciations of\r\nnature and human life, both by ourselves and by the people whom we\r\nseek out for study. Each kind of material has its special value. The\r\nfirst has the advantage of the perspicuity which comes from simplicity,\r\nsimilar for our purposes to the value of the rudimentary forms of life\r\nfor the biologist. But this advantage of early art may be overestimated;\r\nfor the nature of beauty is better revealed in its maturer\r\nmanifestations, even as the purposes of an individual are more fully,\r\nif not more clearly, embodied in maturity than in youth or childhood.\r\n\r\nYet a purely objective method will not suffice to give us an adequate\r\nidea of beauty. For beautiful things are created by men, not passively\r\ndiscovered, and are made, like other things which men make, in order\r\nto realize a purpose. Just as a saw is a good saw only when it fulfills\r\nthe purpose of cutting wood, so works of art are beautiful only because\r\nthey embody a certain purpose. The beautiful things which we study by\r\nthe objective method are selected by us from among countless other\r\nobjects and called beautiful because they have a value for us, without\r\na feeling for which we should not know them to be beautiful at all.\r\nThey are not, like sun and moon, independent of mind and will and\r\ncapable of being understood in complete isolation from man. No world\r\nof beauty exists apart from a purpose that finds realization there.\r\nWe are, to be sure, not always aware of the existence of this purpose\r\nwhen we enjoy a picture or a poem or a bit of landscape; yet it is\r\npresent none the less. The child is equally unaware of the purpose of\r\nthe food which pleases him, yet the purpose is the ground of his\r\npleasure; and we can understand his hunger only through a knowledge\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nThe dependence of beauty upon a relation to purpose is clear from the\r\nfact that in our feelings and judgments about art we not only change\r\nand disagree, but correct ourselves and each other. The history of\r\ntaste, both in the individual and the race, is not a mere process, but\r\na progress, an evolution. \"We were wrong in calling that poem\r\nbeautiful,\" we say; \"you are mistaken in thinking that picture a good\r\none\"; \"the eighteenth century held a false view of the nature of\r\npoetry\"; \"the English Pre-Raphaelites confused the functions of poetry\r\nand painting\"; \"to-day we understand what the truly pictorial is better\r\nthan Giotto did\"; and so on. Now nothing can be of worth to us, one\r\nthing cannot be better than another, nor can we be mistaken as to its\r\nvalue except with reference to some purpose which it fulfills or does\r\nnot fulfill. There is no growth or evolution apart from a purpose in\r\nterms of which we can read the direction of change as forward rather\r\nthan backward.\r\n\r\nThis purpose cannot be understood by the observation and analysis, no\r\nmatter how careful, of beautiful _things_; for it exists in the\r\nmind primarily and only through mind becomes embodied in things; and\r\nit cannot be understood by a mere inductive study of aesthetic\r\nexperiences--the mind plus the object--just as they come; because, as\r\nwe have just stated, they are changeful and subject to correction,\r\ntherefore uncertain and often misleading. The aesthetic impulse may\r\nfalter and go astray like any other impulse; a description of it in\r\nthis condition would lead to a very false conception. No, we must\r\nemploy a different method of investigation--the Socratic method of\r\nself-scrutiny, the conscious attempt to become clear and consistent\r\nabout our own purposes, the probing and straightening of our aesthetic\r\nconsciences. Instead of accepting our immediate feelings and judgments,\r\nwe should become critical towards them and ask ourselves, What do we\r\nreally seek in art and in life which, when found, we call beautiful?\r\nOf course, in order to answer this question we cannot rely on an\r\nexamination of our own preferences in isolation from those of our\r\nfellow-men. Here, as everywhere, our purposes are an outgrowth of the\r\ninherited past and are developed in imitation of, or in rivalry with,\r\nthose of other men. The problem is one of interpreting the meaning of\r\nart in the system of culture of which our own minds are a part.\r\nNevertheless, the personal problem remains. Aesthetic value is\r\nemphatically personal; it must be felt as one's own. If I accept the\r\nstandards of my race and age, I do so because I find them to be an\r\nexpression of my own aesthetic will. In the end, my own will to beauty\r\nmust be cleared up; its darkly functioning goals must be brought to\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nNow, unless we have thought much about the matter or are gifted with\r\nunusual native taste, we shall find that our aesthetic intentions are\r\nconfused, contradictory, and entangled with other purposes. To become\r\naware of this is the first step towards enlightenment. We must try to\r\ndistinguish what we want of art from what we want of other things,\r\nsuch as science or morality; for something unique we must desire from\r\nanything of permanent value in our life. In the next place we should\r\ncome to see that we cannot want incompatible things; that, for example,\r\nwe cannot want art to hold the mirror up to life and, at the same time,\r\nto represent life as conforming to our private prejudices; or want a\r\npicture to have expressive and harmonious colors and look exactly like\r\na real landscape; or long for a poetry that would be music or a\r\nsculpture that would be pictorial. Finally, we must make sure that our\r\ninterpretation of the aesthetic purpose is representative of the actual\r\nfullness and manysidedness of it; we should observe, for example, that\r\nsensuous pleasure is not all that we seek from art; that truth of some\r\nkind we seek besides; and yet that in some sort of union we want both.\r\n\r\nThis clearing up can be accomplished only in closest touch with the\r\nactual experience of beauty; it must be performed upon our working\r\npreferences and judgments. It must be an interpretation of the actual\r\nhistory of art. There is no a priori method of establishing aesthetic\r\nstandards. Just as no one can discover his life purpose apart from the\r\nprocess of living, or the purpose of another except through sympathy;\r\nso no one can know the meaning of art except through creating and\r\nenjoying and entering into the aesthetic life of other artists and art\r\nlovers.\r\n\r\nThis so-called normative--perhaps better, critical--moment in aesthetics\r\nintroduces an inevitable personal element into every discussion of the\r\nsubject. Even as every artist seeks to convince his public that what\r\nhe offers is beautiful, so every philosopher of art undertakes to\r\npersuade of the validity of his own preferences. I would not make any\r\nsecret of this with regard to the following pages of this book. Yet\r\nthis intrusion of personality need not be harmful, but may, on the\r\ncontrary, be valuable. It cannot be harmful if the writer proceeds\r\nundogmatically, making constant appeals to the judgment of his readers\r\nand claiming no authority for his statements except in so far as they\r\nfind favor there. Influence rather than authority is what he should\r\nseek. In presenting his views, as he must, he should strive to stimulate\r\nthe reader to make a clear and consistent formulation of his own\r\npreferences rather than to impose upon him standards ready made. And\r\nthe good of the personal element comes from the power which one strong\r\npreference or conviction has of calling forth another, and compelling\r\nit to the discovery and defense of its grounds.\r\n\r\nIn so far as aesthetics is studied by the objective method it is a\r\nbranch of psychology. Aesthetic facts are mental facts. A work of art,\r\nno matter how material it may at first seem to be, exists only as\r\nperceived and enjoyed. The marble statue is beautiful only when it\r\nenters into and becomes alive in the experience of the beholder. Keys\r\nand strings and vibrations of the air are but stimuli for the auditory\r\nexperience which is the real nocturne or etude. Ether vibrations and\r\nthe retina upon which they impinge are nothing more than instruments\r\nfor the production of the colors which, together with the interpretation\r\nof them in terms of ideas and feelings, constitute the real picture\r\nwhich we appreciate and judge. The physical stimuli and the\r\nphysiological reactions evoked by them are important for our purpose\r\nonly so far as they help us to understand the inner experiences with\r\nwhich they are correlated. A large part of our work, therefore, will\r\nconsist in the psychological analysis of the experience of art and the\r\nmotives underlying its production. We shall have to distinguish the\r\nelements of mind that enter into it, show their interrelations, and\r\ndifferentiate the total experience from other types of experience.\r\nSince, moreover, art is a social phenomenon, we shall have to draw\r\nupon our knowledge of social psychology to illumine our analysis of\r\nthe individual's experience. Art is a historical, even a technical,\r\ndevelopment; hence the personal enjoyment of beauty itself is\r\nconditioned by factors that spring from the traditions of groups of\r\nartists and art lovers. No one can understand his pleasure in beauty\r\napart from the pleasure of others.\r\n\r\nIn so far, on the other hand, as aesthetics is an attempt to define\r\nthe purpose of art and so to formulate the standards presupposed in\r\njudgments of taste, it is closely related to criticism. The relation\r\nis essentially that between theory and the application of theory. It\r\nis the office of the critic to deepen and diffuse the appreciation of\r\nparticular works of art. For this purpose he must possess standards;\r\nbut he need not be, and in fact often is not, aware of them. A fine\r\ntaste may serve his ends. Not infrequently, however, the critic\r\nendeavors to make clear to himself and his readers the principles he\r\nis employing. Now, on its normative side, aesthetics is ideally the\r\ncomplete rationale of criticism, the systematic achievement, for its\r\nown sake, of what the thoughtful critic attempts with less exactness\r\nand for the direct purpose of appreciation. It is beyond the province\r\nof aesthetics to criticize any particular work of art, except by way\r\nof illustration. The importance of illustration for the sake of\r\nexplaining and proving general principles is, however, fundamental;\r\nfor, as we have seen, a valuable aesthetic theory is impossible unless\r\ndeveloped out of the primary aesthetic life of enjoyment and estimation,\r\na life of contact with individual beautiful things. No amount of\r\npsychological skill in analysis or philosophical aptitude for definition\r\ncan compensate for want of a real love of beauty,--of the possession\r\nof something of the artistic temperament. People who do not love art,\r\nyet study it from the outside, may contribute to our knowledge of it\r\nthrough isolated bits of analysis, but their interpretations of its\r\nmore fundamental nature are always superficial. Hence, just as the\r\nwise critic will not neglect aesthetics, so the philosopher of art\r\nshould be something of a critic. Yet the division of labor is clear\r\nenough. The critic devotes himself to the appreciation of some special\r\ncontemporary or historical field of art--Shakespearean drama,\r\nRenaissance sculpture, Italian painting, for example; while the\r\nphilosopher of art looks for general principles, and gives attention\r\nto individual works of art and historical movements only for the purpose\r\nof discovering and illustrating them. And, since the philosopher of\r\nart seeks a universal idea of art rather than an understanding of this\r\nor that particular work of art, an intimate acquaintance with a few\r\nexamples, through which this idea can be revealed to the loving eye,\r\nis of more importance than a wide but superficial aesthetic culture.\r\n\r\nIn our discussion thus far, we have been assuming the possibility of\r\naesthetic theory. But what shall we say in answer to the mystic who\r\ntells us that beauty is indefinable? First of all, I think, we should\r\nremind him that his own thesis can be proved or refuted only through\r\nan attempt at a scientific investigation of beauty. Every attempt to\r\nmaster our experience through thought is an adventure; but the futility\r\nof adventures can be shown only by courageously entering into them.\r\nAnd, although the failure of previous efforts may lessen the\r\nprobabilities of success in a new enterprise, it cannot prove that\r\nsuccess is absolutely impossible. Through greater persistence and\r\nbetter methods the new may succeed where the old have failed. Moreover,\r\nalthough we are ready to grant that the pathway to our goal is full\r\nof pitfalls, marked by the wreckage of old theories, yet we claim that\r\nthe skeptic or the mystic can know of their existence only by traveling\r\nover the pathway himself; for in the world of the inner life nothing\r\ncan be known by hearsay. If, then, he would really know that the road\r\nto theoretical insight into beauty is impassable, let him travel with\r\nus and see; or, if not with us, alone by himself or with some one wiser\r\nthan we as guide; let him compare fairly and sympathetically the results\r\nof theoretical analysis and construction with the data of his firsthand\r\nexperience and observe whether the one is or is not adequate to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nAgain, the cleft between thought and feeling, even subtle and fleeting\r\naesthetic feeling, is not so great as the mystics suppose. For, after\r\nall, there is a recognizable identity and permanence even in these\r\nfeelings; we should never call them by a common name or greet them as\r\nthe same despite their shiftings from moment to moment if this were\r\nnot true. Although whatever is unique in each individual experience\r\nof beauty, its distinctive flavor or nuance, cannot be adequately\r\nrendered in thought, but can only be felt; yet whatever each new\r\nexperience has in common with the old, whatever is universal in all\r\naesthetic experiences, can be formulated. The relations of beauty,\r\ntoo, its place in the whole of life, can be discovered by thought\r\nalone; for only by thought can we hold on to the various things whose\r\nrelations we are seeking to establish; without thought our experience\r\nfalls asunder into separate bits and never attains to unity. Finally,\r\nthe mystics forget that the life of thought and the life of feeling\r\nhave a common root; they are both parts of the one life of the mind\r\nand so cannot be foreign to each other.\r\n\r\nThe motive impelling to any kind of undertaking is usually complex,\r\nand that which leads to the development of aesthetic theory is no\r\nexception to the general rule. A disinterested love of understanding\r\nhas certainly played a part. Every region of experience invites to the\r\nplay of intelligence upon it; the lover of knowledge, as Plato says,\r\nloves the whole of his object. Yet even intelligence, insatiable and\r\nimpartial as it is, has its predilections. The desire to understand\r\na particular type of thing has its roots in an initial love of it. As\r\nthe born botanist is the man who finds joy in contact with tree and\r\nmoss and mushroom, so the student of aesthetics is commonly a lover\r\nof beauty. And, although the interest which he takes in aesthetic\r\ntheory is largely just the pleasure in possessing clear ideas, one may\r\nquestion whether he would pursue it with such ardor except for the\r\ncontinual lover's touch with picture and statue and poem which it\r\ndemands. For the intelligent lover of beauty, aesthetic theory requires\r\nno justification; it is as necessary and pleasurable for him to\r\nunderstand art as it is compulsive for him to seek out beautiful things\r\nto enjoy. To love without understanding is, to the thoughtful lover,\r\nan infidelity to his object. That the interest in aesthetic theory is\r\npartly rooted in feeling is shown from the fact that, when developed\r\nby artists, it takes the form of a defense of the type of art which\r\nthey are producing. The aesthetic theory of the German Romanticists\r\nis an illustration of this; Hebbel and Wagner are other striking\r\nexamples. These men could not rest until they had put into communicable\r\nand persuasive form the aesthetic values which they felt in creation.\r\nAnd we, too, who are not artists but only lovers of beauty, find in\r\ntheory a satisfaction for a similar need with reference to our\r\npreferences.[Footnote: Compare Santayana: The Sense of Beauty, p. 11.]\r\n\r\nMore important to the average man is the help which aesthetic theory\r\nmay render to appreciation itself. If to the basal interest in beauty\r\nbe added an interest in understanding beauty, the former is quickened\r\nand fortified and the total measure of enjoyment increased. Even the\r\nlove of beauty, strong as it commonly is, may well find support through\r\nconnection with an equally powerful and enduring affection. The\r\naesthetic interest is no exception to the general truth that each part\r\nof the mind gains in stability and intensity if connected with the\r\nothers; isolated, it runs the risk of gradual decay in satiety or\r\nthrough the crowding out of other competing interests, which if joined\r\nwith it, would have kept it alive instead. Moreover, the understanding\r\nof art may increase the appreciation of particular works of art. For\r\nthe analysis and constant attention to the subtler details demanded\r\nby theory may bring to notice aspects of a work of art which do not\r\nexist for an unthinking appreciation. As a rule, the appreciations of\r\nthe average man are very inadequate to the total possibilities offered,\r\nextending only to the more obvious features. Often enough besides,\r\nthrough a mere lack of understanding of the purpose of art in general\r\nand of the more special aims of the particular arts, people expect to\r\nfind what cannot be given, and hence are prejudiced against what they\r\nmight otherwise enjoy. The following pages will afford, I hope, abundant\r\nillustrations of this truth.\r\n\r\nFinally, aesthetic theory may have a favorable influence upon the\r\ncreation of art. Not that the student of aesthetics can prescribe to\r\nthe artist what he shall or shall not do; for the latter can obey, for\r\nbetter or worse, only the inner imperative of his native genius. Yet,\r\ninevitably, the man of genius receives direction and cultivation from\r\nthe aesthetic sentiment of the time into which he is born and grown;\r\neven when he reacts against it, he nevertheless feels its influence;\r\na sound conception of the nature and purpose of art may save him from\r\nmany mistakes. The French classical tradition in sculpture and painting,\r\nwhich is not merely academic, having become a part of public taste,\r\nprevented the production of the frightful crudities which passed for\r\nart in Germany and England during the present and past centuries. By\r\nhelping to create a freer and more intelligent atmosphere for the\r\nartist to be born and educated in, and finer demands upon him when\r\nonce he has begun to produce and is seeking recognition, the student\r\nof aesthetics may indirectly do not a little for him. And surely in our\r\nown country, where an educated public taste does not exist and the\r\nfiercest prejudices are rampant, there is abundant opportunity for\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF ART\r\n\r\n\r\nSince it is our purpose to develop an adequate idea of art, it might\r\nseem as if a definition were rather our goal than our starting point;\r\nyet we must identify the field of our investigations and mark it off\r\nfrom other regions; and this we can do only by means of a preliminary\r\ndefinition, which the rest of our study may then enrich and complete.\r\n\r\nWe shall find it fruitful to begin with the definition recently revived\r\nby Croce: [Footnote: Benedetto Croce: _Estetica_, translated into\r\nEnglish by Douglas Ainslie, under title _Aesthetic_, chap. i.] art\r\nis expression; and expression we may describe, for our own ends, as\r\nthe putting forth of purpose, feeling, or thought into a sensuous\r\nmedium, where they can be experienced again by the one who expresses\r\nhimself and communicated to others. Thus, in this sense, a lyric poem\r\nis an expression--a bit of a poet's intimate experience put into words;\r\nepic and dramatic poetry are expressions--visions of a larger life\r\nmade manifest in the same medium. Pictures and statues are also\r\nexpressions; for they are embodiments in color and space-forms of the\r\nartists' ideas of visible nature and man. Works of architecture and\r\nthe other industrial arts are embodiments of purpose and the well-being\r\nthat comes from purpose fulfilled.\r\n\r\nThis definition, good so far as it goes, is, however, too inclusive;\r\nfor plainly, although every work of art is an expression, not every\r\nexpression is a work of art. Automatic expressions, instinctive\r\noverflowings of emotion into motor channels, like the cry of pain or\r\nthe shout of joy, are not aesthetic. Practical expressions also, all\r\nsuch as are only means or instruments for the realization of ulterior\r\npurposes--the command of the officer, the conversation of the market\r\nplace, a saw--are not aesthetic. Works of art--the _Ninth Symphony_, the\r\n_Ode to the West Wind_--are not of this character.\r\n\r\nNo matter what further purposes artistic expressions may serve, they\r\nare produced and valued for themselves; we linger in them; we neither\r\nmerely execute them mechanically, as we do automatic expressions, nor\r\nhasten through them, our minds fixed upon some future end to be gained\r\nby them, as is the case with practical expressions. Both for the artist\r\nand the appreciator, they are ends in themselves. Compare, for example,\r\na love poem with a declaration of love.[Footnote: Contrast Croce's use\r\nof the same illustration: Esthetic, p. 22, English translation.] The\r\npoem is esteemed for the rhythmic emotional experience it gives the\r\nwriter or reader; the declaration, even when enjoyed by the suitor,\r\nhas its prime value in its consequences, and the quicker it is over\r\nand done with and its end attained the better. The one, since it has\r\nits purpose within itself, is returned to and repeated; the other,\r\nbeing chiefly a means to an end, would be senseless if repeated, once\r\nthe end that called it forth is accomplished. The value of the love\r\npoem, although written to persuade a lady, cannot be measured in terms\r\nof its mere success; for if beautiful, it remains of worth after the\r\nlady has yielded, nay, even if it fails to win her. Any sort of\r\npractical purpose may be one motive in the creation of a work of art,\r\nbut its significance is broader than the success or failure of that\r\nmotive. The Russian novel is still significant, even now, alter the\r\nrevolution. As beautiful, it is of perennial worth and stands out by\r\nitself. But practical expressions are only transient links in the\r\nendless chain of means, disappearing as the wheel of effort revolves.\r\nArt is indeed expression, but free or autonomous expression.\r\n\r\nThe freedom of aesthetic expression is, however, only an intensification\r\nof a quality that may belong to any expression. For, in its native\r\ncharacter, expression is never merely practical; it brings its own\r\nreward in the pleasure of the activity itself. Ordinarily, when a man\r\nmakes something embodying his need or fancy, or says something that\r\nexpresses his meaning, he enjoys himself in his doing. There is\r\nnaturally a generous superfluity in all human behavior. The economizing\r\nof it to what is necessary for self-preservation and dominion over the\r\nenvironment is secondary, not primary, imposed under the duress of\r\ncompetition and nature. Only when activities are difficult or their\r\nfruits hard to get are they disciplined for the sake of their results\r\nalone; then only does their performance become an imperative, and\r\nnature and society impose upon them the seriousness and constraint of\r\nnecessity and law. But whenever nature and the social organization\r\nsupply the needs of man ungrudgingly or grant him a respite from the\r\nurgency of business, the spontaneity of his activities returns. The\r\ndoings of children, of the rich, and of all men on a holiday illustrate\r\nthis. Compare, for example, the speech of trade, where one says the\r\nbrief and needful thing only, with the talk of excursionists, where\r\nverbal expression, having no end beyond itself, develops at length and\r\nat leisure; where brevity is no virtue and abundant play takes the\r\nplace of a narrow seriousness.\r\n\r\nBut we have not yet so limited the field of expression that it becomes\r\nequivalent to the aesthetic; for not even all of free expression is\r\nart. The most important divergent type is science. Science also is\r\nexpression,--an embodiment in words, diagrams, mathematical symbols,\r\nchemical formula, or other such media, of thoughts meant to portray\r\nthe objects of human experience. Scientific expressions have, of course,\r\na practical function; concepts are \"plans of action\" or servants of\r\nplans, the most perfect and delicate that man possesses. Yet scientific\r\nknowledge is an end in itself as well as a utility; for the mere\r\nconstruction and possession of concepts and laws is itself a source\r\nof joy; the man of science delights in making appropriate formulations\r\nof nature's habits quite unconcerned about their possible uses.\r\n\r\nIn science, therefore, there is much free expression; but beauty not\r\nyet. No abstract expression such as Euclid's _Elements_, Newton's\r\n_Principia_, or Peano's _Formulaire_, no matter how rigorous and\r\ncomplete, is a work of art. We admire the mathematician's formula\r\nfor its simplicity and adequacy; we take delight in its clarity and\r\nscope, in the ease with which it enables the mind to master a thousand\r\nmore special truths, but we do not find it beautiful. Equally removed\r\nfrom the sphere of the beautiful are representations or descriptions\r\nof mere things, whether inaccurate or haphazard, as we make them in\r\ndaily life, or accurate and careful as they are elaborated in the\r\nempirical sciences. No matter how exact and complete, the botanist's\r\nor zoologist's descriptions of plant and animal life are not works of\r\nart. They may be satisfactory as knowledge, but they are not beautiful.\r\nThere is an important difference between a poet's description of a\r\nflower and a botanist's, or between an artistic sketch and a photograph,\r\nconferring beauty upon the former, and withholding it from the latter.\r\n\r\nThe central difference is this. The former are descriptions not of\r\nthings only, but of the artist's reactions to things, his mood or\r\nemotion in their presence. They are expressions of total, concrete\r\nexperiences, which include the self of the observer as well as the\r\nthings he observes. Scientific descriptions, on the other hand, render\r\nobjects only; the feelings of the observer toward them are carefully\r\nexcluded. Science is intentionally objective,--from the point of view\r\nof the artistic temperament, dry and cold. Even the realistic novel\r\nand play, while seeking to present a faithful picture of human life\r\nand to eliminate all private comment and emotion, cannot dispense with\r\nthe elementary dramatic feelings of sympathy, suspense, and wonder.\r\nsthetic expression is always integral, embodying a total state of\r\nmind, the core of which is some feeling; scientific expression is\r\nfragmentary or abstract, limiting itself to thought. Art, no less than\r\nscience, may contain truthful images of things and abstract ideas, but\r\nnever these alone; it always includes their life, their feeling tones,\r\nor values. Because philosophy admits this element of personality, it\r\nis nearer to art than science is. Yet some men of science, like James\r\nand Huxley, have made literature out of science because they could not\r\nhelp putting into their writings something of their passionate interest\r\nin the things they discovered and described.\r\n\r\nThe, necessity in art for the expression of value is, I think, the\r\nprincipal difference between art and science, rather than, as Croce\r\n[Footnote: _Estetica_, quarta edizione, p.27; English translation.\r\np.36.] supposes, the limitation of art to the expression of the\r\nindividual and of Science to the expression of the concept. For, on\r\nthe one hand, science may express the individual; and, on the other\r\nhand, art may express the concept. The geographer, for example,\r\ndescribes and makes maps of particular regions of the earth's surface;\r\nthe astronomer studies the individual sun and moon. Poets like Dante,\r\nLucretius, Shakespeare, and Goethe express the most universal concepts\r\nof ethics or metaphysics. But what makes men poets rather than men of\r\nscience is precisely that they never limit themselves to the mere clear\r\nstatement of the concept, but always express its human significance\r\nas well. A theory of human destiny is expressed in Prospero's lines--\r\n\r\n  We are such stuff\r\n  As dreams are made of, and our little life\r\n  Is rounded with a sleep;\r\n\r\nbut with overtones of feeling at the core. Or consider the passion\r\nwith which Lucretius argues for a naturalistic conception of the\r\nuniverse. And the reason why poets clothe their philosophical\r\nexpressions in concrete images is not because of any shame of the\r\nconcept, but just in order the more easily and vividly to attach and\r\ncommunicate their emotion. Their general preference for the concrete\r\nhas the same motive; for there are only a few abstractions capable of\r\narousing and fixing emotion.\r\n\r\nEven as an element of spontaneity is native to all expression, so\r\noriginally all expression is personal. This is easily observable in\r\nthe child. His first uses of words as well as of things are touched\r\nwith emotion. Every descriptive name conveys to him his emotional\r\nreaction to the object; disinterested knowledge does not exist for\r\nhim; every tool, a knife or a fork, means to him not only something\r\nto be used, but the whole background of feelings which its use involves.\r\nOur first perceptions of things contain as much of feeling and attitude\r\nas of color and shape and sound and odor. Pure science and mere industry\r\nare abstractions from the original integrity of perception and\r\nexpression; mutilations of their wholeness forced upon the mind through\r\nthe stress of living. To be able to see things without feeling them,\r\nor to describe them without being moved by their image, is a disciplined\r\nand derivative accomplishment. Only as the result of training and of\r\nhaste do the forms and colors of objects, once the stimuli to a\r\nwondering and lingering attention, become mere cues to their recognition\r\nand employment, or mere incitements to a cold and disinterested analysis\r\nand description. Knowledge may therefore enter into beauty when, keeping\r\nits liberality, it participates in an emotional experience; and every\r\nother type of expression may become aesthetic if, retaining its native\r\nspontaneity, it can acquire anew its old power to move the heart. To\r\nbe an artist means to be, like the child, free and sensitive in\r\nenvisaging the world.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions, nature as well as art may be beautiful. In\r\nthemselves, things are never beautiful. This is not apparent to common\r\nsense because it fails to think and analyze. But beauty may belong to\r\nour _perceptions_ of things. For perception is itself a kind of\r\nexpression, a process of mind through which meanings are embodied in\r\nsensations. Given are only sensations, but out of the mind come ideas\r\nthrough which they are interpreted as objects. When, for example, I\r\nperceive my friend, it may seem as if the man himself were a given\r\nobject which I passively receive; but, as a matter of fact, all that\r\nis given are certain visual sensations; that these are my friend, is\r\npure interpretation--I construct the object in embodying this thought\r\nin the color and shape I see. The elaboration of sensation in perception\r\nis usually so rapid that, apart from reflection, I do not realize the\r\nmental activity involved. But if it turns out that it was some other\r\nman that I saw, then I realize at once that my perception was a work\r\nof mind, an expression of my own thought. Of course, not all perceptions\r\nare beautiful. Only as felt to be mysterious or tender or majestic is\r\na landscape beautiful; and women only as possessed of the charm we\r\nfeel in their presence. That is, perceptions are beautiful only when\r\nthey embody feelings. The sea, clouds and hills, men and women, as\r\nperceived, awaken reactions which, instead of being attributed to the\r\nmind from which they proceed, are experienced as belonging to the\r\nthings evoking them, which therefore come to embody them. And this\r\nprocess of emotional and objectifying perception has clearly no other\r\nend than just perception itself. We do not gaze upon a landscape or\r\na pretty child for any other purpose than to get the perceptual,\r\nemotional values that result. The aesthetic perception of nature is,\r\nas Kant called it, disinterested; that is, autonomous and free. The\r\nbeauty of nature, therefore, is an illustration of our definition.\r\n\r\nOn the same terms, life as remembered or observed or lived, may have\r\nthe quality of beauty. In reverie we turn our attention back over\r\nevents in our own lives that have had for us a rare emotional\r\nsignificance; these events then come to embody the wonder, the interest,\r\nthe charm that excited us to recollect them. Here the activity of\r\nremembering is not a mere habit set going by some train of accidental\r\nassociation; or merely practical, arising for the sake of solving some\r\npresent problem by applying the lesson of the past to it; or finally,\r\nnot unpleasantly insistent, like the images aroused by worry and sorrow,\r\nbut spontaneous and self-rewarding, hence beautiful. There are also\r\nevents in the lives of other people, and people themselves, whose lives\r\nread like a story, which, by absorbing our pity or joy or awe, claim\r\nfrom us a like fascinated regard. And there are actions we ourselves\r\nperform, magnificent or humble, like sweeping a room, which, if we put\r\nourselves into them and enjoy them, have an equal charm. And they too\r\nhave the quality of beauty.\r\n\r\nDespite the community between beautiful nature and art, the differences\r\nare striking. Suppose, in order fix our ideas, we compare one of Monet's\r\npictures of a lily pond with the aesthetic appreciation of the real\r\npond. The pond is undoubtedly beautiful every time it is seen; with\r\nits round outline, its sunlit, flower-covered surface, its background\r\nof foliage, it is perhaps the source and expression of an unfailing\r\ngladness and repose. Now the painting has very much the same value,\r\nbut with these essential differences. First, the painting is something\r\ndeliberately constructed and composed, the artist himself controlling\r\nand composing the colors and shapes, and hence their values also; while\r\nthe natural beauty is an immediate reaction to given stimuli, each\r\nobserver giving meaning to his sensations without intention or effort.\r\nLike the beauty of woman, it is almost a matter of instinct. In natural\r\nbeauty, there is, to be sure, an element of conscious intention, in\r\nso far as we may purposely select our point of view and hold the object\r\nin our attention; hence this contrast with art, although real and\r\nimportant, is not absolute. Moreover, beauty in perception and memory\r\nis the basis of art; the artist, while he composes, nevertheless partly\r\ntranscribes significant memories and observations. Yet, although\r\nrelative, the difference remains; art always consists of works of art,\r\nnatural beauty of more immediate experiences. And from this difference\r\nfollows another--the greater purity and perfection of art. The control\r\nwhich the artist exerts over his material enables him to make it\r\nexpressive all through; every element conspires toward the artistic\r\nend; there are no irrelevant or recalcitrant parts, such as exist in\r\nevery perception of nature. Last, the beauty of the painting, because\r\ncreated in the beholder through a fixed and permaneat mechanism\r\nconstructed by the artist, is communicable and abiding, whereas the\r\nimmediate beauty of nature is incommunicable and transient. Since the\r\nsthetic perception of nature has its starting point in variable aspects\r\nthat never recur, no other man could see or feel the lily pond as Monet\r\nsaw and felt it. And, although in memory we may possess a silent gallery\r\nof beautiful images, into which we may enter privately as long as we\r\nlive, in the end the flux has its way and at death shatters this\r\ntreasure house irrevocably. Hence, only if the beauty of the lily pond\r\nis transferred to a canvas, can it be preserved and shared.\r\n\r\nThe work of art is the tool of the aesthetic life. Just as organic\r\nefficiency is tied to the nerve and muscle of the workman and cannot\r\nbe transferred to another, but the tool, on the other hand, is\r\nexchangeable and transmissible (I cannot lend or bequeath my arm, but\r\nI can my boat); and just as efficiency is vastly increased by the use\r\nof tools (I can go further with my boat than I can swim); so, through\r\nworks of art, aesthetic capacity and experience are enhanced and become\r\ncommon possessions, a part of the spiritual capital of the race.\r\nMoreover, even as each invention becomes the starting point for new\r\nones that are better instruments for practical ends; so each work of\r\nart becomes the basis for new experiments through which the aesthetic\r\nexpression of life attains to higher levels. Monet's own art, despite\r\nits great originality, was dependent upon all the impressionists, and\r\nthey, even when they broke away from, were indebted to, the traditions\r\nof French painting established by centuries. Through art, the aesthetic\r\nlife, which otherwise would be a private affair, receives a social\r\nsanction and assistance.\r\n\r\nThat permanence and communication of expression are essential to a\r\ncomplete conception of art can be discerned by looking within the\r\nartistic impulse itself. However much the artist may affect indifference\r\nto the public, he creates expecting to be understood. Mere self-\r\nexpression does not satisfy him; he needs in addition appreciation.\r\nDeprived of sympathy, the artistic impulse withers and dies or supports\r\nitself through the hope of eventually finding it. The heroism of the\r\npoet consists in working on in loneliness; but his crown of glory is\r\nwon only when all men are singing his songs. And every genuine artist,\r\nas opposed to the mere improviser or dilettante, wishes his work to\r\nendure.[Footnote: See Anatole France: _Le Lys Rouge_. \"Moi, dit\r\nChoulette, je pense si peu a l'avenir terrestre que j'ai ecrit mes\r\nplus beaux poemes sur les feuilles de papier a cigarettes. Elles se\r\nsont facilement evanuies, ne laissant a mes vers qu'une espece\r\nd'existence metaphysique.\" C'etait un air de negligence qu'il se\r\ndonnait. En fait, il n'avait jamais perdu une ligne de son ecriture.]\r\nHaving put his substance into it, he desires its preservation as he\r\ndoes his own. His immortality through it is his boast.\r\n\r\n  Exegi monumentum aere perennius\r\n  Regalique situ pyramidum altius\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n  Non omnis moriar.\r\n\r\nArt is not mere inspiration, the transient expression of private moods,\r\nbut a work of communication, meant to endure.\r\n\r\nThere are certain distinguishing characteristics of aesthetic expression\r\nall of which are in harmony with the description we have given of it.\r\nIn the first place, in art the sensuous medium of the expression\r\nreceives an attention and possesses a significance not to be found in\r\nother types of expression. Although every one hears, no one attends\r\nto the sound of the voice in ordinary conversation; one looks through\r\nit, as through a glass, to the thought or emotion behind. In our routine\r\nperceptions of nature, we are not interested in colors and shapes on\r\ntheir own account, but only in order that we may recognize the objects\r\npossessing them; in a scientific woodcut also, they are indifferent\r\nto us, except in so far as they impart correct information about the\r\nobjects portrayed. Outside of art, sensation is a mere transparent\r\nmeans to the end of communication and recognition. Compare the poem,\r\nthe piece of music, the artistic drawing or painting. There the words\r\nor tones must be not only heard but listened to; the colors and lines\r\nnot only seen but held in the eye; of themselves, apart from anything\r\nthey may further mean, they have the power to awaken feeling and\r\npleasure. And this is no accident. For the aesthetic expression is meant\r\nto possess worth in itself and is deliberately fashioned to hold us\r\nto itself, and this purpose will be more certainly and effectively\r\naccomplished if the medium of the expression has the power to move and\r\nplease. We enter the aesthetic expression through the sensuous medium;\r\nhence the artist tries to charm us at the start and on the outside;\r\nhaving found favor there, he wins us the more easily to the content\r\nlying within.\r\n\r\nIf the medium, moreover, instead of being a transparent embodiment of\r\nthe artist's feelings, can express them in some direct fashion as well,\r\nthe power of the whole expression will gain. This is exactly what the\r\nsound of the words of a poem or the colors and lines of a painting or\r\nstatue can do. As mere sound and as mere color and line, they convey\r\nsomething of the feeling tone of the subject which, as symbols, they\r\nare used to represent. For example, the soft flowing lines of Correggio,\r\nquite apart from the objects they represent, express the voluptuous\r\nhappiness of his \"Venus and Mars\"; the slow rhythm of the repeated\r\nword sounds and the quality of the vowels in the opening lines of\r\n_Tithonus_ are expressive in themselves, apart from their meaning,\r\nof the weariness in the thoughts of the hero, and so serve to re-express\r\nand enforce the mood of those thoughts. When we come to study the\r\nparticular arts, we shall find this phenomenon of re-expression through\r\nthe medium everywhere.\r\n\r\nA second characteristic distinguishing aesthetic expressions from other\r\nexpressions is their superior unity. In the latter, the unity lies in\r\nthe purpose to be attained or in the content of the thought expressed;\r\nit is teleological or logical. The unity of a chair is its purpose,\r\nwhich demands just such parts and in just such a mechanical arrangement;\r\nthe unity of a business conversation is governed by the bargain to be\r\nclosed, requiring such words and such only, and in the appropriate\r\nlogical and grammatical order. The unity of an argument is the thesis\r\nto be proved; the unity of a diagram is the principle to be illustrated\r\nor the information to be imparted. Compare the unity of a sonnet or\r\na painting. In a sonnet, there is a unity of thought and sentiment\r\ncreating a fitting grammatical unity in language, but in addition a\r\nhighly elaborate pattern in the words themselves that is neither\r\ngrammatical nor logical. In a painting, besides the dramatic unity of\r\nthe action portrayed, as in a battle scene; or of the spatial and\r\nmechanical togetherness of things, as in a landscape; there is a harmony\r\nof the colors, a composition of the lines and masses themselves, not\r\nto be found in nature. And, although the general shape and arrangement\r\nof the parts of a useful object is dominated by its purpose, if it is\r\nalso beautiful--a Louis Seize chair, for example--there is, besides,\r\na design that cannot be explained by use. In artistic expressions,\r\ntherefore, there exists a unity in the material, superposed upon the\r\nunity required by the purpose or thought expressed. And this property\r\nfollows from the preceding. For, since the medium is valuable in itself,\r\nthe mind, which craves unity everywhere, craves it there also, and\r\nlingers longer and more happily on finding it; and, since the medium\r\ncan be expressive, the unity of the fundamental mood of the thought\r\nexpressed will overflow into and pervade it. Hence there occurs an\r\nautonomous development of unity in the material, raising the total\r\nunity of the expression to a higher power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE INTRINSIC VALUE OF ART\r\n\r\n\r\nOur definition of art can be complete only if it enables us to\r\nunderstand the value of art. The reader may well ask what possible\r\nvalue expression can have when it becomes an end in itself. \"I can\r\nunderstand,\" he may say, \"the value of expression for the sake of\r\ncommunication and influence, but what value can it have of itself?\"\r\nAt this point, moreover, we are concerned with the intrinsic value\r\nimmediately realized in the experience of art, not with further values\r\nthat may result from it. Art, no less than practical expression, may\r\nhave effects on other experiences, which have to be considered in\r\nmeasuring its total worth; but these we shall leave for investigation\r\nin our last chapters, after we have reached our fullest comprehension\r\nof art; we are interested now, in order to test and complete our\r\ndefinition, in the resident value only. As a help toward reaching a\r\nsatisfactory view, let us examine critically some of the chief theories\r\nin the field. First, the theory, often called \"hedonistic,\" that the\r\nvalue of art consists in the satisfactions of sense which the media\r\nof aesthetic expression afford--the delight in color and sound and\r\nrhythmical movement of line and form. The theory finds support in the\r\nindustrial arts, where beauty often seems to be only a luxurious charm\r\nsupervening upon utility; but also in painting and sculpture when\r\nappreciated in their decorative capacity as \"things of beauty.\" There\r\nis a partial truth in this theory; for, as we have seen, the sensuous\r\nmedia of all the arts tend to be developed in the direction of pleasure;\r\nand no man who lacks feeling for purely sensuous values can enter into\r\nthe fullness of the aesthetic experience. But the theory fails in not\r\nrecognizing the expressive function of sensation in art. As Goethe\r\nsaid, art was long formative, that is, expressive, before it was\r\nbeautiful, in the narrow sense of charming.[Footnote: \"Die kunst is\r\nlange bildend eh sie schon ist.\" _Von Deutscher Baukunst_, 1773.]\r\nIn order to be beautiful, it is not enough for a work of art to offer\r\nus delightful colors and lines and sounds; it must also have a\r\nmeaning--it must speak to us, tell us something.\r\n\r\nThe second theory which I shall examine is the moralistic or Platonic.\r\nAccording to this, art is an image of the good, and has value in so\r\nfar as through expression it enables us to experience edifying emotions\r\nor to contemplate noble objects. The high beauty of the \"Sistine\r\nMadonna,\" for example, would be explained as identical with the worth\r\nof the religious feelings which it causes in the mind of the beholder.\r\nThe advantage of art over life is supposed to consist in its power to\r\ncreate in the imagination better and more inspiring objects than life\r\ncan offer, and to free and control the contemplation of them. This is\r\nthe narrower interpretation of the theory. When the notion of the good\r\nis liberalized so as to include innocent happiness as well as the\r\nstrictly ethical and religious values, beauty is conceded to belong\r\nto pictures of fair women and children, and to lyrics and romances,\r\nprovided there is nothing in them to shock the moral sense. Aesthetic\r\nvalue is the reflection--the imaginative equivalent--of moral or\r\npractical value.\r\n\r\nThe prime difficulty of this theory is its inadequacy as an\r\ninterpretation of the whole of actual art; for, in order to find support\r\namong existing examples, it is compelled to make an arbitrary selection\r\nof such as can be made to fit it. Actual art is quite as much an image\r\nof evil as of good; there is nothing devilish which it has not\r\nrepresented. And this part of art is often of the highest aesthetic\r\nmerit. Velasquez's pictures of dwarfs and degenerate princes are as\r\nartistic as Raphael's Madonnas; Goethe's Mephistopheles is one of his\r\nsupreme artistic achievements; Shakespeare is as successful artistically\r\nin his delineation of Lady Macbeth as of Desdemona. Now for us who\r\nclaim that the purpose of art must be divined from the actual practice\r\nof artists, from the inside, and should not be an arbitrary\r\nconstruction, from the outside, the existence of such examples is\r\nsufficient to refute the theory in question. If the artist finds a\r\nvalue in the representation of evil, value exists there and can be\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nIf, indeed, the sole effect of artistic expression were to bring to\r\nthe mind objects and emotions in the same fashion that ordinary life\r\ndoes, then the value of art, the image of life, would be a function\r\nof the value of the life imaged. And just as one seeks contact with\r\nthe good in real life and avoids the evil, so one would seek in art\r\nimaginative contact with the good alone. But expression, and above all\r\nartistic expression, does something more than present objects to the\r\nimagination and arouse emotions. Art is not life over again, a mere\r\nshadow of life; if it were, what would be its unique value? who would\r\nnot prefer the substance to the shadow? The expression of life is not\r\nlife itself; hence, even if the evil in life be always evil, the\r\nexpression of it may still be a good.\r\n\r\nAnother theory, often called the \"intellectualistic\" theory, claims\r\nthat the purpose of art is truth. \"Beauty is truth; truth, beauty.\"\r\nThe immediate pleasure which we feel in the beautiful is the same as\r\nthe instant delight in the apprehension of truth. There is no difference\r\nin purpose or value between science and art, but only a difference in\r\nmethod--science presents truth in the form of the abstract judgment;\r\nart, in the form of the concrete image or example.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty with this theory is the uncertainty as to what is meant\r\nby truth; hence the many shapes it assumes. But before going deeply\r\ninto this question, let us consider some of the simple facts which\r\nseem to tell for and against the theory. There can be no doubt that\r\nmany examples of the representative arts--painting, sculpture, novel,\r\nand drama--are praised for their truth. We demand truth of coloring\r\nor line in painting, of form in sculpture, of character and social\r\nrelation in the drama or novel. On the other hand, we admit aesthetic\r\nvalue to fanciful painting and literature, and to expressions of beliefs\r\nwhich no one accepts at the present time. We appreciate the beauty of\r\nDante's descriptions of the Inferno and of the conversations between\r\nhim and its inhabitants without believing them to be reports of fact.\r\nNo one values the _Blue Bird_ the less because it is not an account\r\nof an actual occurrence. Even with regard to the realistic novel and\r\ndrama, no one thinks of holding them to the standards of historical\r\nor scientific accuracy. And, although we may demand of a landscape\r\npainting plausibility of color and line, we certainly do not require\r\nthat it be a representation of any identifiable scene.\r\n\r\nIf by truth, therefore, be meant a description or image of matters of\r\nfact, then surely it is not the purpose of art to give us this truth.\r\nThe artist, to be sure, may give this, as when the landscapist paints\r\nsome locality dear to his client or the portraitist paints the client\r\nhimself; but he does not need to do this, and the aesthetic value of\r\nhis work is independent of it; for the picture possesses its beauty\r\neven when we know nothing of its model. In the language of current\r\nphilosophy, truth in the sense of the correspondence of a portrayal\r\nto an object external to the portrayal, is not \"artistic truth.\"\r\n\r\nThe partisans of the intellectualistic theory would, of course, deny\r\nthat they ever meant truth with this meaning. \"We mean by truth,\" they\r\nwould say, \"an embodiment in sensuous or imaginative form of some\r\nuniversal principle of nature and life. The image may be entirely\r\nfictitious or fanciful, but so long as the principle is illustrated,\r\nessential truth, and that is beauty, is attained.\" But if this were\r\nso, every work of art would be the statement of a universal truth, as\r\nindeed philosophical adherents of this theory have always\r\nmaintained--witness Hegel. Yet what is the universal truth asserted\r\nin one of Monet's pictures of a lily pond? There is, of course, an\r\nobservance of the general laws of color and space, but does the beauty\r\nof the picture consist in that? Does it not attach to the representation\r\nof the concrete, individual pond? I do not mean that there may not be\r\nbeauty in the expression of universals; in fact, I have explicitly\r\nmaintained that there may, under certain conditions; I am simply\r\ninsisting that beauty may belong to expressions of the individual also,\r\nand that you cannot reduce these to mere illustrations of universal\r\nideas. Because of its completeness and internal harmony, the philosopher\r\nmay find the simplest melody a revelation of the Absolute; but even\r\nif it were, its beauty would still pertain to it primarily as a\r\nrevelation of the individual experience which it embodies. Again, by\r\nreason of the freedom from the particular conditions out of which it\r\narises acquired by a work of art, its individual meaning easily becomes\r\ntypical, so that it often serves as a universal under which individuals\r\nsimilar to those represented are subsumed--as when we speak of \"a\r\nFaust\" or \"a Hamlet\"; nevertheless, the adequate expression of the\r\nindividual is at once the basis of its beauty and of its extended,\r\nuniversalized significance. It is when works of art are profoundly\r\nindividual that we generalize their meaning. In art the individual\r\nnever sinks to the position of a mere specimen or example of a universal\r\nlaw. The intellectualistic theory is partly true of symbolic art, but\r\nnot wholly, for even there, the individuality of the symbol counts.\r\nAnd yet, as we shall see, there is another meaning of artistic truth,\r\nwhich is legitimate.\r\n\r\nAesthetic value, therefore, is not alone sensuous value or ethical or\r\nscientific or philosophical value. A work of art may contain one or\r\nall of these values; but they do not constitute its unique value as\r\nart. The foregoing attempts to define the value of art fail because\r\nthey renounce the idea of unique value, substituting goodness, sensuous\r\npleasure, or truth-values found outside of art. But the intrinsic value\r\nof art must be unique, for it is the value of a unique activity--the\r\nfree expression of experience in a form delightful and permanent,\r\nmediating communication. And this value we should be able to discover\r\nby seeking the difference which supervenes upon experience through\r\nexpression of this kind.\r\n\r\nApart from expression, experience may be vivid and satisfactory as we\r\nfeel and think and dream and act; yet it is always in flux, coming and\r\ngoing, shifting and unaware. But through expression it is arrested by\r\nbeing attached to a permanent form, and there can be retained and\r\nsurveyed. Experience, which is otherwise fluent and chaotic, or when\r\norderly too busy with its ends to know itself, receives through\r\nexpression the fixed, clear outlines of a thing, and can be contemplated\r\nlike a thing. Every one has verified the clarifying effect of expression\r\nupon ideas, how they thus acquire definiteness and coherence, so that\r\neven the mind that thinks them can hold them in review. But this effect\r\nupon feeling is no less sure. The unexpressed values of experience are\r\nvague strivings embedded in chaotic sensations and images; these\r\nexpression sorts and organizes by attaching them to definite ordered\r\nsymbols. Even what is most intimate and fugitive becomes a stable\r\nobject. When put into patterned words, the subtlest and deepest passions\r\nof a poet, which before were felt in a dim and tangled fashion, are\r\nbrought out into the light of consciousness. In music, the most elusive\r\nmoods, by being embodied in ordered sounds, remain no longer\r\nsubterranean, but are objectified and lifted into clearness. In the\r\nnovel or drama, the writer is able not only to enact his visions of\r\nlife in the imagination, but, by bodying them forth in external words\r\nand acts, to possess them for reflection. In painting, all that is\r\nseen and wondered at in nature is seen with more delicacy and\r\ndiscrimination and felt with greater freedom; or the vague fancies\r\nwhich a heated imagination paints upon the background of the mind come\r\nout more vivid and better controlled, when put with care upon a canvas.\r\n\r\nEven ordinary expression, of course, arrests and clarifies experience,\r\nenabling us to commune with ourselves; but since its purpose is usually\r\nbeyond itself, this result is hasty and partial, limited to what is\r\nneedful for the practical end in view. In art alone is this value\r\ncomplete. For there, life is intentionally held in the medium of\r\nexpression, put out into color and line and sound for the clear sight\r\nand contemplation of men. The aim is just to create life upon which\r\nwe may turn back and reflect.\r\n\r\nThis effect of artistic expression upon experience has usually been\r\ncalled \"intuition.\" Because of its connotation of mysterious knowledge,\r\nintuition is not a wholly satisfactory word, yet is probably as good\r\nas any for the purpose of denoting what artists and philosophers of\r\nart have had in mind and what we have been trying to describe. Other\r\nterms might also serve--vision, sympathetic insight (sympathetic,\r\nbecause it includes the value of experience; insight, because it\r\ninvolves possessing experience as a whole and ordered, and as an object\r\nfor reflection). Intuition is opposed, on the one hand, to crude\r\nunreflecting experience that never observes itself as a whole or attains\r\nto clearness and self-possession; and, on the other hand, to science,\r\nwhich gives the elements and relations of an experience, the classes\r\nto which it belongs, but loses its uniqueness and its values. Science\r\nelaborates concepts of things, gives us knowledge about things; art\r\npresents us with the experience of things purified for contemplation.\r\nScientific truth is the fidelity of a description to the external\r\nobjects of experience; artistic truth is sympathetic vision--the\r\norganization into clearness of experience itself.\r\n\r\nCompare, for illustration, life as we live it from day to day with our\r\ndelineation of it as we recall it and tell it to an intimate companion;\r\nand then compare that with the analysis and classification of it which\r\nsome psychologist or sociologist might make. Or compare the kind of\r\nknowledge of human nature that we get from Shakespeare or Moliere with\r\nthe sort that we get from the sciences. In the one case, knowledge\r\nattends a personal acquaintance with the experience, a bringing of it\r\nhome, a feeling for its values, a realization of the inner necessity\r\nof its elements; in the other, it is a mere set of concepts. Or finally,\r\ncompare the knowledge of the human figure contained in an anatomist's\r\nmanual with a painting of it, where we not only see it, but in the\r\nimagination touch it and move with it, in short live with it.\r\n\r\nIntuition is the effect of artistic appreciation no less than of\r\nartistic creation. If the artist's expression of his feelings and ideas\r\nresults in intuition, our appreciation of his work must have the same\r\nvalue, for appreciation is expression transferred from the artist to\r\nthe spectator. By means of the colors, lines, words, tones that he\r\nmakes, the artist determines in us a process of expression similar to\r\nhis. Out of our own minds we put into the sense-symbols he has woven\r\nideas and feelings which provide the content and meaning he intends.\r\nHence all aesthetic appreciation is self-expression. This is evident\r\nin the case of the more lyrical types of art. The lyric poem is\r\nappreciated by us as an expression of our own inner life; music as an\r\nexpression of our own slumberous or subconscious moods. Yet even the\r\nmore objective types of art, like the novel or the drama, become forms\r\nof self-expression, for we have to build up the worlds which they\r\ncontain in our own imagination and emotion. We have to live ourselves\r\nout in them; we can understand them only in terms of our own life.\r\n\r\nIn the appreciation of the more objective types of art, the personality\r\nexpressed is not, of course, the actual personality; but rather the\r\nself extended and expanded through the imagination. The things which\r\nI seem to see and enjoy in the landscape picture I may have never\r\nreally seen; I may have never really moved through the open plain\r\nthere, as I seem to move, toward the mountain in the distance. The\r\nacts described in the novel or portrayed on the stage I do not really\r\nperform; the opinions uttered by the persons I do not hold. And yet,\r\nin order to appreciate the picture, it must be _as if_ I really\r\nsaw the mountain and moved towards it; in order to appreciate the novel\r\nor the play, I must make the acts and opinions mine. And this I can\r\ndo; for, as it is a commonplace to note, each one of us has within him\r\ncapacities of action and emotion and thought unrealized--the actual\r\nself is only one of many that might have been--hundreds of possible\r\nlives slumber in our souls. And no matter which of these lives we have\r\nchosen for our own, or have had forced upon us by our fate, we always\r\nretain a secret longing for all the others that have gone unfulfilled,\r\nand an understanding born of longing. Some of these we imagine\r\ndistinctly--those that we consciously rejected or that a turn of chance\r\nmight have made ours; but most of them we ourselves have not the power\r\neven to dream. Yet these too beckon us from behind, and the artist\r\nprovides us with their dream. Through art we secure an imaginative\r\nrealization of interests and latent tendencies to act and think and\r\nfeel which, because they are contradictory among themselves or at\r\nvariance with the conditions of our existence, cannot find free play\r\nwithin our experience. That same sort of imaginative enlarged expression\r\nof self that we get vicariously by participating in the life of our\r\nfriends we get also from art.[Footnote: Compare Santayana: _The Sense\r\nof Beauty_, p. 186.]\r\n\r\nYet in appreciation, as in creation, expression results in intuition.\r\nAppreciation is no mere imagining, transitory and lawless like a\r\ndaydream. The activity of the imagination is so organized in a permanent\r\nand perspicuous form that we not only live it, but possess it as an\r\nobject. The activities engaged in building up the work of art in my\r\nown mind are not the whole of me; judgment remains free to watch and\r\nsynthesize those that are being crystallized there. In looking at a\r\nportrait, for example, the process of interpreting the life represented\r\nis ancillary to a total judgment of character. In the novel or drama,\r\nno matter with what abandon I put myself into the persons and\r\nsituations, the expression of them in outward words and acts, and the\r\norganization which the artist has imposed upon them, makes of them\r\npermanent objects for reflection, not mere modes of feeling and\r\nimagining to endure. Self-expression that does not attain to\r\nobjectivity is incomplete as art. Even music and lyric poetry are\r\nsomething more than mere feeling. In all genuine art, experience takes\r\non permanence and form--a synthesis, a total meaning, supervenes within\r\nthe flux of impressions and ideas and moods, not excluding, but\r\nembracing and controlling them. That is intuition.\r\n\r\nThe insight into experience which art provides is the more valuable\r\nbecause it is communicable; to possess it alone would be a good, but\r\nto share it is better. All values become enhanced when we add to them\r\nthe joy of fellow feeling. The universality of aesthetic expression\r\ncarries with it the universality of aesthetic insight. Merely private\r\nand unutterable inspirations are not art. Beauty does for life what\r\nscience does for intelligence; even as the one universalizes thought,\r\nso the other universalizes values. In expressing himself, the artist\r\ncreates a form into which all similar experiences can be poured and\r\nout of which they can all be shared. When, for example, we listen to\r\nthe hymns of the church or read the poems of Horace, the significance\r\nof our experience is magnified because we find the feelings of millions\r\nthere; we are in unison with a vast company living and dead. No thing\r\nof beauty is a private possession. All artists feed on one another and\r\ninto each experience of art has gone the mind-work of the ages.\r\n\r\nBut there are two types of universality, one by exclusion, the other\r\nby inclusion. Communists like Tolstoy demand that art express only\r\nthose feelings that are already common, the religious and moral; they\r\nwould exclude all values that have not become those of the race. But\r\nthis is to diminish the importance of art; for it is art's privilege\r\nto make feelings common by providing a medium through which they can\r\nbe communicated rather than merely to express them after they have\r\nbecome common. Understanding is more valuable when it encompasses the\r\nthings that tend to separate and distinguish men than when it is limited\r\nto the things that unite them. There is nothing so bizarre that art\r\nmay not express it, provided it be communicable.\r\n\r\nThe life of the imagination, which is the life of art, is, moreover,\r\nthe only life that we can have in common. Sharing life can never mean\r\nanything else than possessing the life of one another sympathetically.\r\nActually to lead another's life would involve possessing his body,\r\noccupying his position, doing his work, and so destroying him. But\r\nthrough the sympathetic imagination we can penetrate his life and leave\r\nhim in possession. To do this thoroughly is possible, however, only\r\nwith the life of a very few people, with intimates and friends. With\r\nthe mass, we can share only ideal things like religion or patriotism,\r\nbut these also are matters of imagination. Now art enlarges the scope\r\nof this common life by creating a new imaginary world to which we can\r\nall belong, where action, enjoyment, and experience do not involve\r\ncompetition or depend on possession and mastery.\r\n\r\nFinally, the intuitions that art provides are relatively permanent.\r\nArt not only extends life and enables us to share it, but also preserves\r\nit. Existence has a leak in it, as Plato said; experience flows in and\r\nthen flows out forever. The individual passes from one act to another,\r\nfrom one phase of life to another, childhood, then youth, then old\r\nage. So the race; one generation follows another, and each type of\r\ncivilization displaces a predecessor. Against this flux, our belief\r\nin progress comforts us; maturity is better than youth, we think, and\r\neach generation happier and more spiritual than the last. Yet the\r\nconsolations of progress are partial. For even if we always do go on\r\nto something better in the future, the past had its unique value, and\r\nthat is lost ineluctably. The present doubtless repeats much of the\r\nform of the past--the essential aspects of human nature remain the\r\nsame; but the subtle, distinctive bloom of each stage of personal life,\r\nand of each period of the world's history, is transient. We cannot\r\nagain become children, nor can we possess again the strenuous freedom\r\nof the Renaissance or the unclouded integrity of personality of the\r\nGreeks.\r\n\r\nIn the life of the individual, however, the flux is not absolute; for\r\nthrough memory we preserve something of the unique value of our past.\r\nIts vividness, its fullness, the sharp bite of its reality go; but a\r\nsubtilized essence remains. And the worth that we attach to our\r\npersonality depends largely upon it; for the instinct of self-\r\npreservation penetrates the inner world; we strive not only to maintain\r\nour physical existence in the present, but our psychic past as well.\r\nIn conserving the values of the past through memory we find a\r\nsatisfaction akin to that of protecting our lives from danger. Through\r\nmemory we feel childhood's joys and youth's sweet love and manhood's\r\ntriumphs still our own, secure against the perils of oblivion.\r\n\r\nNow art does for the race what memory does for the individual. Only\r\nthrough expression can the past be preserved for all men and all time.\r\nWhen the individual perishes, his memories go with him; unless,\r\ntherefore, he puts them into a form where they can be taken up into\r\nthe consciousness of other men, they are lost forever. And just as the\r\nindividual seeks a vicarious self-preservation through identifying\r\nhimself with his children and his race, and finds compensation for his\r\nown death in their continuance, so he rejoices when he knows that men\r\nwho come after will appreciate the values of his life. We of the present\r\nfeel ourselves enriched, in turn, as by a longer memory, in adding to\r\nthe active values of our own lives the remembered values of the past.\r\nTheir desire to know themselves immortal is met by our desire to unite\r\nour lives with all our past. Art alone makes this possible. History\r\nmay tell us what men did, but only the poet or other artist can make\r\nus relive the values of their experience. For through expression they\r\nmake their memories, or their interpretations of other men's memories,\r\nours. Art is the memory of the race, the conserver of its values.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing characteristics of aesthetic expression observed by\r\nus--the pleasurableness of the medium, the enhanced unity--serve\r\nintuition as that has been described by us. One of the strongest\r\nobjections against the theory of art as intuition, as that theory has\r\nbeen developed by Croce, for example, is that it provides no place for\r\ncharm. Yet without charm there is no complete beauty, and any\r\ninterpretation of the facts of the aesthetic experience which neglects\r\nthis element is surely inadequate. But charm although an indispensable,\r\nis not an independent, factor in the experience of art; for it serves\r\nintuition. It does so in two ways. The charm of the medium, by drawing\r\nattention to itself, increases the objectivity of the experience\r\nexpressed. Even when the experiences felt into color and line and sound\r\nare poignantly our own, to live pleasantly in any one of these\r\nsensations is to live as an object to oneself, the life sharing the\r\nexternality of the medium--we put our life out there more readily when\r\nit is pleasant there. And the charm of the medium serves intuition in\r\nanother way. When the activities of thought and feeling and imagination\r\nreleased by the work of art are delightful, they become more delightful\r\nstill if the medium in which they function is itself delightful. To\r\nimagine\r\n\r\n  Charm'd magic casements, opening on the foam\r\n  Of perilous seas, in fairy lands forlorn\r\n\r\nis a pleasure by itself, but more pleasurable, and therefore more\r\nspontaneous, because of the melody of sound in which it is enveloped.\r\nAnd when the activities expressed are not pleasant, the expression of\r\nthem in a delightful medium helps to induce us to make them our own\r\nand accept them notwithstanding. The medium becomes a charming net to\r\nhold us, and because of its allurements we give ourselves the more\r\nfreely to its spirit within. The following, for example, is not an\r\nagreeable thought:\r\n\r\n  To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,\r\n  Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,\r\n  To the last syllable of recorded time;\r\n  And all our yesterdays have lighted fools\r\n  The way to dusty death.\r\n\r\nYet the expression of this thought is pleasant, among other reasons,\r\nbecause of the rhythmic charm of language. We shall come back to this\r\nfact in our chapter on \"The Problem of Evil in Aesthetics.\" There is\r\nno contradiction between the fair form of a work of art and its content,\r\nhowever repellent. For if we value the sympathetic knowledge of life,\r\nwe shall be glad of any means impelling us to undertake what alone can\r\ngive this--a friendly dwelling with life itself. Thus the decorative\r\nand the expressive functions of art are reconciled--pleasure and\r\nintuition meet.\r\n\r\nJust as from time to time pleasure in sensation has been one-sidedly\r\nthought to be the purpose of art, so likewise the unity characteristic\r\nof beautiful things. Indeed, beauty and order have become almost\r\nsynonymous in popular thought. And, to be sure, this unity, as we have\r\nalready remarked, has its own value; the mind delights in order just\r\nfor its own sake, and the artist, who is bent on making something\r\nworthful on its own account, strives to develop it for that reason.\r\nAnd yet unity is no more independent of expression and intuition than\r\nsensation is; it too enters into their service. Many forms of unity\r\nin works of art are themselves media of expression--the simplest and\r\nmost striking example is perhaps the rhythmical ordering of sounds in\r\npoetry and music, the emotional value of which everybody appreciates.\r\nIn a later chapter, I shall try to show that the same is true of harmony\r\nand balance. In another way, also, unity serves intuition. For the\r\nexistence of order in an experience is indispensable to that wholeness\r\nof view, that mastery in the mind, which is half of intuition. The\r\nmerely various, the chaotic, the disorganized, cannot be grasped or\r\nunderstood. In order that an experience may be understood, its items\r\nmust be strung together by some principle in terms of which they may\r\ndemand each other and constitute a whole. Organization _is_\r\nunderstanding. Every work of art, every beautiful thing, is organized,\r\nand, as we have observed, organized not merely in the thought or other\r\nmeaning expressed, but throughout, in the sensuous medium as well.\r\n\r\nSo far the value which we have discovered in artistic expression has\r\nbeen that of delightful and orderly sympathetic vision. This is\r\nsupplemented from still another source of value. Through artistic\r\nexpression pent-up emotions find a welcome release. No matter how\r\npoignant be the experience expressed, the weight, the sting of it\r\ndisappears through expression. For through expression, as we have seen,\r\nthe experience is drawn from the dark depths of the self to the clear\r\nand orderly surface of the work of art; the emotions that weighed are\r\nlifted out and up into color and line and sound, where the mind can\r\nview and master them. Mere life gives place to the contemplation of\r\nlife; and contemplation imposes on life some of the calm that is its\r\nown. The most violent and unruly passions may be the material of art,\r\nbut once they are put into artistic form they are mastered and refined.\r\n\"There is an art of passion, but no passionate art\" (Schiller). Through\r\nexpression, the repression, the obstruction of feeling is broken down;\r\nthe mere effort to find and elaborate a fitting artistic form for the\r\nmaterial diverts the attention and provides other occupation for the\r\nmind; an opportunity is given to reflect upon and understand the\r\nexperience, bringing it somehow into harmony with one's total\r\nlife,--through all these means procuring relief. It is impossible to\r\ncite the famous passage from Goethe's \"Poetry and Truth\" too often:--\r\n\r\n  And thus began that bent of mind from which I could not\r\n  deviate my whole life through; namely, that of turning into\r\n  an image, into a poem, everything that delighted or troubled\r\n  me, or otherwise occupied my attention, and of coming to\r\n  some certain understanding with myself thereupon....\r\n  All the works therefore that have been published by me are\r\n  only fragments of one great confession.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: English translation, edited by Parke Godwin, Vol. I, p.66.]\r\n\r\nThis effect of artistic expression belongs, of course, to other forms\r\nof expression. Every confession, every confidential outpouring of\r\nemotion, is an example. We have all verified the truth that to formulate\r\nfeeling is to be free with reference to it; not that we thereby get\r\nrid of it, but that we are able to look it in the face, and find some\r\nplace for it in our world where we can live on good terms with it. The\r\ngreatest difficulty in bearing with any disappointment or sorrow comes\r\nnot from the thing itself--for after all we have other things to live\r\nfor--but from its effect upon the presuppositions, so to speak, of our\r\nentire existence. The mind has an unconscious set of axioms or\r\npostulates which it assumes in the process of living; now anything\r\nthat seems to contradict these, as a great calamity does, by destroying\r\nthe logic of life, makes existence seem meaningless and corrupts that\r\nfaith in life which is the spring of action. In order for the health\r\nof the mind to be restored, the contradictory fact must be somehow\r\nreconciled with the mind's presuppositions, and the rationality of\r\nexistence reaffirmed. But an indispensable preliminary to this is that\r\nwe should clearly envisage and reflect upon the fact, viewing it in\r\nits larger relations, where it will lose its overwhelming significance.\r\nNow that is what expression, by stabilizing and clarifying experience,\r\nenables us to do.\r\n\r\nA great many works of art besides Goethe's, not merely of lyric poetry,\r\nbut also of the novel and drama, among them some of the greatest, like\r\nthe _Divine Comedy_, so far as they spring intimately from the\r\nlife of the artist, are \"fragments of a great confession,\" and have\r\nhad the sanitary value of a confession for their creators. It is not\r\nalways possible to trace the personal feelings and motives lying behind\r\nthe artist's fictions; for the suffering soul covers its pains with\r\nsubtle disguises; yet even when we do not know them, we can divine\r\nthem. We are certain, for example, that Watteau's gay pictured visions\r\nwere the projection--and confession--of his own disappointed dreams.\r\nThe great advantage of art over ordinary expression, in this respect,\r\nis its universality. Art is the confessional of the race. The artist\r\nprovides a medium through which all men can confess themselves and\r\nheal their souls. In making the artist's expression ours, we find an\r\nequal relief. Who does not feel a revival of some old or present despair\r\nof his own when he reads:--\r\n\r\n  Un grand sommeil noir\r\n  Tombe sur ma vie;\r\n  Dormez toute espoir,\r\n  Dormez toute envie!\r\n\r\n  Je ne vois plus rien,\r\n  Je perds la memoire\r\n  Du mal et du bien....\r\n  Oh, la triste histoire!\r\n\r\nyet who does not at the same time experience its assuagement? And this\r\neffect is not confined to lyrical art, for so far as, in novel and\r\ndrama, we put ourselves in the place of the dramatis persona, we can\r\npour our own emotional experiences into them and through them find\r\nrelief for ourselves. Just so, Aristotle recognized the cathartic or\r\nhealing influence of art, both in music and the drama--\"through pity\r\nand fear effecting the proper purgation of these emotions.\" [Footnote:\r\n_Poetics,_ 6, 2. _Politics,_ 5, 7.]\r\n\r\nThe delightsomeness of the work of art and its self-sufficient freedom,\r\nstanding in contrast with the drab or difficult realities of nature\r\nand personal striving, serve also to make of beauty a consoler and\r\nhealer. In place of a confused medley of sense impressions, art offers\r\norderly and pleasant colors or sounds; instead of a real life of duties\r\nhard to fulfill and ambitions painfully accomplished, art provides an\r\nimagined life which, while imitating and thus preserving the interest\r\nof real life, remains free from its hazards and burdens. I would not\r\nbase the value of art on the contrast between art and life; yet it is\r\nunlikely, I think, if life were not so bound and disordered, that art\r\nwould seem so free and perfect; and it is often true that those who\r\nsuffer and struggle most love art best. The unity of the work of art,\r\nin which each element suggests another within its world, keeping you\r\nthere and shutting you out momentarily from the real world to which\r\nyou must presently return, and the sensuous charm of the medium,\r\nfascinating your eyes and ears, bring forgetfulness and a temporary\r\nrelease.\r\n\r\nTo sum the results of the last two chapters. Art is expression, not\r\nof mere things or ideas, but of concrete experience with its values,\r\nand for its own sake. It is experience held in a delightful, highly\r\norganized sensuous medium, and objectified there for communication and\r\nreflection. Its value is in the sympathetic mastery and preservation\r\nof life in the mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE ANALYSIS OF THE AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE: THE ELEMENTS OF THE EXPERIENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThus far we have sought to define art, to form a concrete idea of the\r\nexperience of art, and to place it in its relations to other facts.\r\nWe shall now pass from synthetic definition to psychological analysis.\r\nWe want to pick out the elements of mind entering into the experience\r\nof art and exhibit their characteristic relations. In the present\r\nchapter we shall concern ourselves chiefly with the elements, leaving\r\nthe study of most of the problems of structure to the following chapter.\r\n\r\nEvery experience of art [Footnote: Throughout this discussion, I use\r\n\"experience of art,\" \"aesthetic experience,\" and \"beauty\" with the same\r\nmeaning.] contains, in the first place, the sensations which are the\r\nmedia of expression. In a painting, for example, there are colors; in\r\na piece of music, tones; in a poem, word-sounds. To this material,\r\nsecondly, are attached vague feelings. It is characteristic of aesthetic\r\nexpressions, as we have observed, that their media, quite apart from\r\nanything that they may mean or represent, are expressive of moods--the\r\ncolors of a painting have a _stimmung,_ so have tones and words,\r\nwhen rhythmically composed. The simplest aesthetic experiences, like\r\nthe beauty of single musical tones or colors, are of no greater\r\ncomplexity; yet almost all works of art contain further elements; for\r\nas a rule the sensations do not exist for their own sakes alone, but\r\npossess a function, to represent things. The colors of a landscape\r\npainting are not only interesting to us as beautiful colors, but as\r\nsymbols of a landscape; the words of a ballad charm and stimulate us\r\nnot only through their music, but because of actions or events which\r\nthey bring before the mind. This involves, psychologically speaking,\r\nthat certain ideas--of trees and clouds in the painting, of men and\r\ntheir deeds in the poem--are associated to the sense elements and\r\nconstitute their meaning. Such ideas or meanings are the third class\r\nof elements in the aesthetic experience. But these ideas, in their turn,\r\nalso arouse emotions, only not of the indefinite sort which belong to\r\nthe sense elements, but definite, like the emotions aroused by things\r\nand events in real life. For example, Rembrandt's \"Man with the Gold\r\nHelmet\" will not only move us in a vague way through the character and\r\nrhythm of its lines and colors, but will, in addition, stimulate\r\nsentiments of respect and veneration, similar to those that we should\r\nfeel if the old warrior were himself before us. In such definite\r\nfeelings we have, then, a fourth class of mental elements. A fifth\r\nclass will make our list complete. It consists of images from the\r\nvarious sense departments--sight, hearing, taste, smell, temperature,\r\nmovement--which arise in connection with the ideas or meanings, making\r\nthem concrete and full. For example, some of the colors in a landscape\r\npainting will not only give us the idea that there is sunlight there,\r\nbut will also arouse faint images of warmth, which will make the idea\r\nmore vivid; other colors, representing the clouds, will produce faint\r\nsensations of softness; still others, representing flowers, may produce\r\nfaint odors.\r\n\r\nLet us study sensation as an element in beauty, first. Sensation is\r\nthe door through which we enter into the experience of beauty; and,\r\nagain, it is the foundation upon which the whole structure rests.\r\nWithout feeling for the values of sensation, men may be sympathetic\r\nand intelligent, but they cannot be lovers of the beautiful. They may,\r\nfor example, appreciate the profound or interesting ideas in poetry,\r\nbut unless they can connect them with the rhythm-values of the sounds\r\nof the words, they have only an intellectual or emotional, not an\r\naesthetic experience.\r\n\r\nYet, despite the omnipresence and supreme worth of sensation in beauty,\r\nnot all kinds are equally fit for entrance into the experience. From\r\nthe time of Plato, who writes of \"fair sights and sounds\" only, vision\r\nand hearing have been recognized as the preeminently aesthetic senses.\r\nThese senses provide the basis for all the arts--music and poetry are\r\narts of sound; painting, sculpture, and architecture are arts of vision.\r\nAnd there are good reasons for their special fitness. Most cogent of\r\nall is the fact that vision and hearing are the natural media of\r\nexpression; sounds, be they words or musical tones, convey thoughts\r\nand feelings; so do visual sensations--the facial expression or gesture\r\nseen communicates the inner life of the speaker; and even abstract\r\ncolors and space-forms, like red and the circle, have independent\r\nfeeling-tones. A taste or a temperature sensation may be pleasant or\r\nunpleasant, but has no meaning, either by itself, as a color or a tone\r\nhas, or through association, as a word has. It has no connection with\r\nthe life of feeling or of thought. Its chief significance is\r\npractical--sweet invites to eating, cold impels to the seeking of a\r\nwarm shelter, touch is a preliminary to grasping. All the so-called\r\nlower senses are bound up with instincts and actions. Of course sights\r\nand sounds have also a significance for instinct--the color and form\r\nand voice of the individual of the opposite sex, for example. But,\r\nbefore acting on the prompting of instinct, the lover may pause and\r\nenjoy the appealing color and form; he may connect his feelings with\r\nthem and hold on to and delight in the resulting experience--an\r\nemotional appreciation of the object may intervene between the stimulus\r\nand the appropriate action, and even supplant it. In this way, vision\r\nand hearing may free themselves from the merely practical and become\r\nautonomous embodiments of feeling. The distance between the seen or\r\nheard object and the body is important. The objects of touch and taste,\r\non the other hand, have to be brought into contact with the body; the\r\npractical reaction then follows; there is no time during which it may\r\nbe suspended.\r\n\r\nImportant also, especially for the beauty of art, is our greater power\r\nto control sensations of vision and hearing. Only colors and sounds\r\ncan be woven into complex and stable wholes. Tastes and odors, when\r\nproduced simultaneously or in succession, do not keep their distinctness\r\nas colors and sounds do, but blur and interfere with each other. No\r\none, however ingenious, could construct a symphony of odors or a picture\r\nof tastes. Nevertheless, the possibility of controlling colors and\r\nsounds and of creating stable and public objects out of them, is only\r\na secondary reason for their aesthetic fitness. Even if one could\r\nconstruct instruments for the orderly production of tastes and\r\nodors--and simple instruments of this kind have been devised--one could\r\nnot make works of art out of them; for a succession of such sensations\r\nwould express nothing; they would still be utterly without meaning.\r\nThe fundamental reason for the superiority of sights and sounds is\r\ntheir expressiveness, their connection with the life of feeling and\r\nthought. They take root in the total self; whereas the other elements\r\nremain, for the most part, on the surface.\r\n\r\nUnder favorable conditions, however, all sensations may enter into the\r\nsthetic experience. Despite the close connection between the lower\r\nsenses and the impulses serving practical life, there is a certain\r\ndisinterestedness in all pleasant sensations. Fine wines and perfumes\r\noffer tastes and odors which are sought and enjoyed apart from the\r\nsatisfaction of hunger; in dancing, movement sensations are enjoyed\r\nfor their own sake; in the bath, heat and cold. But, as we have seen,\r\nit is not sufficient for a sensation to be free from practical ends\r\nin order to become aesthetic; it must be connected with the larger\r\nbackground of feeling; it must be expressive. Now, under certain\r\ncircumstances and in particular cases, this may occur, even in the\r\ninstance of the lower senses. The perfume of flowers, of roses and of\r\nviolets, has a strong emotional appeal; it is their \"soul\" as the poets\r\nsay. The odor of incense in a cathedral may be an important element\r\nin devotion, fusing with the music and the architecture. Or recall the\r\nodor of wet earth and reviving vegetation during a walk in the woods\r\non a spring morning. Even sensations of taste may become aesthetic.\r\nAn oft-cited example is the taste of wine on a Rhine steamer. Guyau,\r\nthe French poet-philosopher, mentions the taste of milk after a hard\r\nclimb in the Pyrenees. [Footnote: _Les Problemes de l'esthetique\r\ncontemporaine_, 8me edition, p. 63.] A drink of water from a clear\r\nspring would serve equally well as an example familiar to all. The\r\nwarmth of a fire, of sunlight, of a cozy room, or the cold of a star-lit\r\nwinter night have an emotional significance almost, if not quite, equal\r\nto that of the visual sensations from these objects. Touch seems to\r\nbe irretrievably bound up with grasping and using, but the touch of\r\na well-loved person may be a free and glowing experience, sharing with\r\nsight in beauty. The movement sensations during a run in the open air\r\nor in dancing are not only free from all practical purpose, but are\r\nelements in the total animation. And other examples will come to the\r\nmind of every reader. [Footnote: Compare Volkelt: _System der\r\nAesthetik_, Bd. I, Zweites Capitel, S. 92.]\r\n\r\nAs our illustrations show, the lower senses enter into the beauty of\r\nnature only; they do not enter into the beauty of art. Their beauty\r\nis therefore vague and accidental. It usually depends, moreover, upon\r\nsome support from vision, with the beauty of which it fuses. Apart\r\nfrom the picturesque surroundings seen, the mountain milk and the Rhine\r\nwine would lose much of their beauty; the warmth of sunlight or of\r\nfire, without the brightness of these objects, the odor of flowers\r\nwithout their form and color, would be of small aesthetic worth. Through\r\nconnection with vision the lower senses acquire something of its\r\npermanence and independence. People differ greatly in their capacity\r\nto render the lower senses aesthetic; it is essentially a matter of\r\nrefinement, of power to free them from their natural root in the\r\npractical and instinctive, and lift them into the higher region of\r\nsentiment. But every kind of sensation, however low, may become\r\nbeautiful; this is not to degrade beauty, but to ennoble sensation.\r\n\r\nFrom a psychological standpoint, sensation is the datum of the aesthetic\r\nexperience, the first thing there, while its power to express depends\r\nupon a further process which links it up with thoughts and feelings.\r\nWe must inquire, therefore, how this linkage takes place--how, for\r\nexample, it comes about that the colors of a painting are something\r\nmore than mere colors, being, in addition, embodiments of trees and\r\nsky and foliage, and of liveliness and gayety and other feelings\r\nappropriate to a spring landscape. Let us consider the linkage with\r\nfeeling first.\r\n\r\nThere are two characteristics of aesthetic feeling in its relation to\r\nsensations and ideas which must be taken into account in any\r\nexplanation; its objectification in them and the universality of this\r\nconnection. Expression is embodiment. We find gayety in the colors of\r\nthe painting, joy in the musical tones, happiness in the pictured face,\r\ntenderness in the sculptured pose. We hear the feeling in the sounds\r\nand see it in the lines and colors. The happiness seems to belong to\r\nthe face, the joy to the tones, in the same simple and direct fashion\r\nas the shape of the one or the pitch of the others. The feelings have\r\nbecome true attributes. It is only by analysis that we pick them out,\r\nseparate them from the other elements of idea or sensation in the\r\nwhole, and then, for the purpose of scientific explanation, inquire\r\nhow they came to be connected. And this connection is not one that\r\ndepends upon the accidents of personal experience. It is not, for\r\nexample, like the emotional significance that the sound of the voice\r\nof the loved one has for the lover, which even he may some day cease\r\nto feel, and which other men do not feel at all. It is rather typified\r\nby the emotional value of a melody, which, through psychological\r\nprocesses common to all men, becomes a universal language of feeling.\r\nThe work of art is a communicable, not a private expression.\r\n\r\nAs we have observed, the elements of feeling in the aesthetic experience\r\nare of two broad kinds--either vague, when directly linked with the\r\nsensuous medium, or else definite, when this linkage is mediated by\r\nideas through which the medium is given content and meaning. The former\r\nkind, which I shall consider first, comprises all cases of the emotional\r\nexpressiveness of the medium itself,--of tones and word-sounds and\r\ntheir rhythms and patterns, of colors and lines and space-forms and\r\ntheir designs. The detailed study of this expressiveness I shall leave\r\nto the chapters on the arts; here I wish merely to indicate the kind\r\nof psychological process involved.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the psychological principle of association operates. The\r\ntender expressiveness of certain curved lines, like those of the Greek\r\namphora, for example, is due, partially at least, to association with\r\nlines of the human body, with which normally this feeling is associated.\r\nThe associated object, together with its feeling tone, are sufficiently\r\ncommon to the experience of all men to account for the universality\r\nof the emotion, and the isolation of the stimulus--abstract line--from\r\nits usual context of color and bulk accounts for the vagueness.\r\nSometimes, on the other hand, expressiveness seems to be due to a\r\ndirect psychological relation between the sense-stimulus and the\r\nemotion. This is almost certainly the case with rhythms, and, as I\r\nshall argue in the chapters on painting and music, is at least partially\r\ntrue of colors and tones. The expressiveness is at once too immediate\r\nand too universal to depend upon association with definite things and\r\nevents, or personal, emotional crises. A rhythm, for example, may be\r\nexciting the first time it is heard; one does not have to wait to hear\r\nit at a battle-charge; a melody may be sad even when one has never\r\nheard it sung by chance at parting. Of course the fact that associations\r\nare not remembered is no proof that they do not operate; but it is\r\ndifficult to conceive of any which could operate in these cases. For\r\nthis reason, I think, we must suppose that certain sense-stimuli and\r\ncombinations of stimuli not only produce in the sensory areas of the\r\nbrain the appropriate sensations, but that their effects are prolonged,\r\noverflowing into the motor channels and there causing a total reaction\r\nof the organism, the conscious aspect of which is a vague feeling. The\r\norganic resonance is too slight and diffuse to produce a true emotion;\r\nhence only a mood results.\r\n\r\nIn all the representative arts the vague expressiveness of the medium\r\nis reinforced through emotions aroused by ideas which interpret\r\nsensation as an element of a thing. The green in the painting is not\r\nonly green, but green of the sea; the red is not only red, but red of\r\nthe sky; the curved line is not a mere curve, it is the outline of a\r\nwave. The totality of colors and lines is not a mere color and line\r\ncomposition, but a marine landscape. The feeling tones of the elements\r\nof this complex and of the complex itself are not only those of the\r\ncolors and lines as such, but of the interpretative ideas as well;\r\nwhich in turn are the same as those of the corresponding real things.\r\nThe psychological process is here simple enough. The feeling tone of\r\nthe sea is carried by the idea of the sea, which now fuses with the\r\ngreen color and wavy lines of the painting.\r\n\r\nBut in order fully to explain the phenomena of aesthetic expression,\r\nit is not sufficient to show how the connection between feeling and\r\nsensation and idea takes place; it is necessary, in addition, to explain\r\nthe nature of this connection. The feeling is not experienced by us\r\nas what it is--our reaction to the sensations or represented\r\nobjects--but rather as an objective quality of them. The sounds are\r\nsad, the curve tender, the sea placid and reposeful. Why is this?\r\n\r\nThe explanation is, I think, as follows. Despite their usual\r\nsubjectivity, feelings tend to be located in the objective world\r\nwhenever they are in conflict with or not directly rooted in the\r\npersonal life or character of the individual. In listening to music,\r\nfor example, feelings of despair and terror may be aroused in me who\r\nam perhaps secure and happy; and even if the feelings are joyous, they\r\nare not occasioned by any piece of personal good fortune--my situation\r\nin life is the same now as before. Hence, finding no lodgment in the\r\nego, and having to exist somewhere, they seek a domicile in the sounds\r\nevoking them. And, in general, works of art arouse but offer no personal\r\noccasions for feeling, and therefore absorb it into themselves.\r\n\r\nThe process of objectification may, however, go further. It often\r\nhappens in the aesthetic experience that feelings are not objectified\r\nalone, but carry with them the idea of the self--I come to feel\r\n_myself_ as joyous or despairing in the sounds. The extent to which the\r\nidea of the self thus follows the objectified feelings depends largely\r\nupon the amount of their reverberation throughout the organism. When\r\nthis is small, and the feelings are vague and tenuous, as in color\r\nappreciation, there is little or no definite projection of the idea\r\nof the self; when, on the other hand, it is large and the emotions are\r\nstrong, as oftentimes in music, where breathing, circulation, hand and\r\nfoot are affected, then I myself seem to be there,--striving, pursuing,\r\nstruggling, in the sounds. I am where my body is. The projection of\r\nthe idea of the self is facilitated for the same reason when the body\r\nis actually employed in the creation of the work of art, as in singing\r\nand acting. It also occurs more readily when the life expressed in the\r\nwork of art is akin to the spectator's. Thus, an emotional and\r\nsuggestible woman, in watching a fine performance of \"Magda,\" inevitably\r\nputs herself in the place of the heroine if she has herself lived\r\nthrough a similar experience. But when the life expressed is strikingly\r\nforeign to our own, the projection of the idea of self is more\r\ndifficult; the duality between subject and object tends to remain.\r\n\r\nThese phenomena have excited special attention when, as in painting\r\nand sculpture and the drama, a human being is represented. Suppose,\r\nfor example, I see a statue of a runner ready to start. I not only see\r\nthe form and color of the marble and recognize them as a man's; I also\r\nfeel emotions of excitement, tension, and expectation such as I should\r\nmyself feel were I too posed and waiting to run a race. And these\r\nemotions I experience as the man's, and as his, not in a vague way,\r\nbut as definitely present in his sculptured form, even in particular\r\nparts of it,--in the swelling chest and tightened limbs. Or consider\r\nanother case. Suppose I see Franz Hals' \"Laughing Cavalier.\" I feel\r\njollity in the face, as the cavalier's. Yet in both cases I may feel\r\nthe emotions as also my own--as if I too were about to run or were\r\nlaughing. And the projection of the idea of the self will occur most\r\nreadily if I am myself a runner or a jolly person. In both instances,\r\nmoreover, the process will be mediated by impulses to movements that\r\nare the normal accompaniments of the emotions in question. If I observe\r\nmyself carefully, I may find that my own chest is tending to swell and\r\nmy own limbs to tighten, in imitation of the runner's, or my own pupils\r\nto dilate and the muscles of my face to wrinkle and to part, in\r\nimitation of the Dutchman's. And these movement-impulses I objectify.\r\nI not only see jollity in the face, but laughter as well; in the statue,\r\nnot only excitement, but running. And again--where my body is, there\r\nam I; so I am jolly with the cavalier and excited with the runner. The\r\npsychology of this process is simple enough. In my experience there\r\nis a plain connection between the sight of a movement and sensations\r\nattendant upon movement, and further, a connection between some of\r\nthese movements, namely, the expressive movements, and the emotions\r\nwhich they express. In accordance with the law of association by\r\ncontiguity, whenever any one of several mental elements usually\r\nconnected together is present in the mind, the others tend to arise\r\nalso. So here. Seeing the semblance of tight muscles and a smiling\r\nface, I feel the emotions which have these visual associates, experience\r\nthe correlated movement-sensations, project them all into the object\r\nwhich initiated the process.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, a great deal has been made of these movement-sensations\r\nin explaining aesthetic feeling. [Footnote: See the discussions in Lee\r\nand Thompson: _Beauty and Ugliness_.] Yet in the case of all people who\r\nare not strongly of the motor type, people in whose mental make-up\r\nmovement plays a minor part in comparison with vision and other\r\nsensations, they play a secondary role, or even hardly any role at\r\nall. Most spectators, indeed, instead of actually making slight\r\nmovements imitative of the movements seen or represented, and\r\nexperiencing the corresponding sensations, make no movements at all\r\nand simply experience movement images; this substitution of image for\r\nmovement probably occurs in the minds of all except the most imitative.\r\nMost people, even of the motor type, do not smile when they see the\r\n\"Laughing Cavalier\" or start to run when they see the statue of the\r\nrunner; careful observation of themselves would disclose only faint\r\nmovement images which seem to play about their lips or limbs--mere\r\nimages of movement have supplanted movements. And many visualists would\r\nnot find any images at all. However, although the mistake has been\r\ncommitted by some investigators of supposing that everybody experiences\r\nmovement because they themselves, being of the motor type, do, it\r\ncannot be denied, I think, that such people attain to a vividness of\r\naesthetic living not reached by others. They appreciate beauty with\r\ntheir bodies as well as with their souls. And in their case too, as\r\nhas been shown, aesthetic appreciation is more strongly histrionic--they\r\nnot only put themselves into the work of art, but the idea of themselves\r\nas well.\r\n\r\nFollowing the German school of einfuehlung, I have insisted throughout\r\nthis discussion on the importance of feeling in the aesthetic\r\nexperience; yet I do not think the voice of those people can be\r\nneglected who claim that their experience with works of art is of\r\nslight or no emotional intensity. There are people who would report\r\nthat they feel no jollity when they see the \"Laughing Cavalier,\" or\r\nanguish when they read the Ugolino Canto in the Inferno; yet such\r\npeople often have a highly developed aesthetic taste. How can this\r\ndifference be accounted for?\r\n\r\nStarting with the emotional appreciation of art as primary, we can\r\naccount for it in this wise. It is a familiar phenomenon in the mental\r\nlife for a concept or idea of an emotional experience to take the place\r\nof that experience. What man has not rejoiced when the simple and cold\r\njudgment, \"I suffered then,\" has come to supplant a recurring torment?\r\nOr who that has lived constantly with a sick person has not observed\r\nhow, looking on the face of pain, inevitably the mere comment, \"he is\r\nin distress,\" comes to supplant the liveliest sympathetic thrill? There\r\nare many reasons for this. The idea or judgment is a less taxing thing\r\nthan an emotion, and so is substituted for it in the mind, which\r\neverywhere seeks economy of effort. The idea is also more efficient\r\nfrom a practical point of view, because it leads directly to action\r\nand does not divert and waste energy in diffused and useless movements.\r\nThe physician simply recognizes the states of mind of his patients,\r\nhe does not sympathize with them. Finally our own reactions to an\r\nobjectified emotion may interfere with the emotion. If, for example,\r\nwe see an angry man, our own fear of him may entirely supplant our\r\nsympathetic feeling of his anger. In general, in our dealings with our\r\nfellow men, we are too busy with our attitudes and plans with reference\r\nto them, and too much concerned with economizing our emotional energy,\r\nto get a sympathetic intuition of their inner life, and so are content\r\nwith an intellectual recognition of it. Now this habit of substituting\r\nthe more rapid and economical process of judgment for the longer and\r\nmore taxing one of sympathy, is carried over into the world of art.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the world of art is a region especially fitted for\r\n_einfuehlung._ For there the need for quick action, which in life\r\ntends to syncopate emotion, does not exist. The characteristic attitude\r\nof art is leisurely absorption in an object, giving time for all the\r\npossibilities of feeling or other experience to develop. Moreover, in\r\nart there is not the same saving need for the substitution of idea for\r\nfeeling as in real life. For in art, feeling is not so strong as in\r\nlife; even when the artist expresses his own personal experience, he\r\nlightens its emotional burden through expression, and we, when we make\r\nhis experience ours, find a similar relief. The emotion is genuine,\r\nonly weakened in intensity. In other cases, where the artist constructs\r\na world of fictitious characters and events, our knowledge that they\r\nare not real suffices to diminish the intensity of the emotions aroused.\r\nFor emotions have the practical function of inciting to action, and\r\nwhen action is impossible, as in the purely ideal world of the artist,\r\nthey cannot keep their natural intensity. We cannot feel so strongly\r\nover the mere idea of an event as over a real event. Were it otherwise,\r\nwho could stand the strain of _Hamlet_ or _Othello_?\r\n\r\nThroughout this discussion of the elements of the experience of art,\r\nI have used the terms emotion and feeling with an inclusive meaning,\r\nto cover impulses as well as feelings in the narrower sense. For in\r\nthe aesthetic experience, there are impulses--impulses to move when\r\naction is represented in picture and statue, impulses to act, as when,\r\nin watching a play, we put ourselves in the place of the persons. But\r\nsuch impulses are always checked through the realization that they\r\ncome from sources unrelated to our purposes, and fail to get the\r\nreenforcement or consent of the total self necessary to action. In\r\nreading or singing the \"Marseillaise,\" to cite an example from poetry,\r\nI experience all kinds of impulses--to shoulder a musket, to march,\r\nto kill--but no one of them is carried out. Now an inhibited impulse\r\nis scarcely distinguishable from an emotion. With few exceptions, the\r\nimpulses in art do not issue in resolves, decisions, determinations\r\nto act; or, if they do, the determinations refer to acts to be executed\r\nin the future, in an experience distinct and remote from the\r\nsthetic--the \"Marseillaise\" has doubtless produced such resolutions\r\nin the minds of Frenchmen; and there is much art that is productive\r\nin that way, providing the \"birth in beauty\" of which Plato wrote.\r\n[Footnote: In the _Symposium_.] In art, impulses result in immediate\r\naction only when action is itself the medium of expression, as in the\r\ndance, where impulses to movement pass over into motion. Of course such\r\nactions still remain aesthetic since they serve no practical end and are\r\nvalued for themselves.\r\n\r\nIf the question were raised, which is more fundamental in the aesthetic\r\nexperience, idea or emotion? the answer would have to be, emotion. For\r\nthere exists at least one great art where no explicit ideas are present,\r\nmusic, whereas art without emotion does not exist. Take away the\r\nemotional content from expression and you get either a mere play of\r\nsensations, like fireworks, or else pseudo-science, like the modern\r\nnaturalistic play. However, the supreme importance of the idea in art\r\ncannot be denied. Every complex work of art, save music, is an\r\nexpression of ideas as well as of feelings, and even in music there\r\nexists the tendency for feeling to seek definition in ideas--do we not\r\nsay a musical idea? And do we not find the masters of so abstract an\r\nart as ornament employing their materials to represent symbolic\r\nconceptions? I wish to call the attention of the reader to certain\r\nvery general considerations touching the nature and function of ideas\r\nin the aesthetic experience, leaving the study of the concrete problems\r\nto the more special chapters.\r\n\r\nFirst, the relation of the idea to the sense medium of the expression.\r\nHere, I think, we find something comparable to the process of\r\n_einfuehlung_. For in art, ideas, like feelings, are objectified\r\nin sensation. Only sensations are given; out of the mind come ideas\r\nthrough which the former are interpreted and made into the semblance\r\nof things. Consider, for example, Rembrandt's \"Night-Watch.\" A festal\r\nmood is there in the golds and reds, and gloom in the blacks; but there\r\nalso are the men and drums and arms. If we wished to push the analogy\r\nwith _einfuehlung_, we might coin a corresponding term--_einmeinung_,\r\n\"inmeaning.\" In all the representative arts, this is a process of equal\r\nimportance with infeeling; for the artist strives just as much to\r\nrealize his ideas of objects in the sense material of his art as to put\r\nhis moods there.\r\n\r\nWhen, moreover, we consider that the expression of the more complex\r\nand definite emotions is dependent upon the expression of ideas of\r\nnature and human life, we see that the process is really a single one.\r\nFeeling is a function of ideas; if, then, we demand sincerity in the\r\none, we must equally demand conviction in the other. The poet could\r\nnot convey to us his pleasure at the sight of nature or his awe of\r\ndeath unless he could somehow bring us into their presence. The painter\r\ncould not express the moods of sunlight or of shadow until he had\r\ninvented a technique for their representation. Clear and confident\r\nseeing is a condition of feeling. Hence every advance in the imitation\r\nof nature is an advance in the power of expression. The demand for\r\nfidelity of representation, for \"truth to nature,\" so insistently made\r\nby the common man in his criticism of art, is justified even from the\r\npoint of view of expressionism.\r\n\r\nYet this fidelity of representation does not involve exact reproduction\r\nof nature. The limitations of the media of the arts definitely exclude\r\nthis. No painter can reproduce on a canvas the infinite detail of any\r\nobject or exactly imitate its colors and lines. In the single matter\r\nof brightness, for example, his medium is hopelessly inadequate; even\r\nthe light of the moon is beyond his power, not to speak of the light\r\nof the sun; he has to substitute a relative for an absolute scale of\r\nvalues. The sculptor cannot reproduce the color or hair of the human\r\nbody. However, this failure exactly to imitate nature does not prevent\r\nthe artist from suggesting to us ideas of the objects in which he is\r\ninterested. If the outline of the marble be that of a man, we get the\r\nidea of a man; if the color and shape be that of a tree, we get the\r\nidea of a tree. Our acceptance of these ideas is, of course, only\r\npartial; for we are equally susceptible to the negative suggestions\r\nof the whiteness of the marble and the smallness of the outline of the\r\ntree. Every work of art represents a sort of compromise between reality\r\nand unreality, belief and disbelief.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, despite this compromise, the purpose of art is\r\nuncompromisingly attained. For art does not seek to give us nature\r\nover again, but to express its feeling tones, and these are conveyed\r\nwhen we get an idea of the corresponding object, even if that idea is\r\ninadequate from a strictly scientific point of view. We do not react\r\nemotionally to the infinite detail of any object, but only to its\r\npresence as a whole and to certain salient features. The artist succeeds\r\nwhen he constructs a humanized image of the object--one which arouses\r\nand becomes a center for feeling. This image, when made of a few\r\nelements, may be far more telling than a much more accurate copy; for\r\nthere is no diffusion of interest to irrelevant aspects. How effective\r\na medium for expression are the few and simple lines of Beardsley's\r\ndraftsmanship! The amount of detail necessary to convey an emotionally\r\neffective idea is relative to the technique of the different arts and\r\nvaries also with the suggestibility and discrimination of the observer.\r\nHere no a priori principles can be laid down for what only the\r\nexperimental practice of the artist can determine.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the negative suggestions of a work of art, although they are\r\neffective in preventing entire belief in the reality of the idea\r\nexpressed, do not hinder the communication and appreciation of the\r\nattached feelings. Just so long as the belief attitude is not wholly\r\nextinguished, this is the case; and the skillful artist takes care of\r\nthat. Of course, an attitude of self-surrender, of willingness to\r\naccept suggestions, has to be present and we cooperate with the artist\r\nin creating it. Aesthetic belief implies sufficient abandon that we\r\nmay react emotionally to a suggestion, but not enough that we may react\r\npractically. We let the idea tell upon our feelings; we do not let it\r\nincite us to action. The aesthetic plausibility of an idea depends\r\nlargely upon its initial plausibility with the artist. There is nothing\r\nmore contagious than belief. To utter things with an accent of\r\nconviction is half the battle in getting oneself believed. If the\r\nartist pretends to believe something and expresses himself with an air\r\nof assurance, we accept it, no matter how preposterous it may be from\r\nthe practical or scientific point of view. Think of Rabelais!\r\n\r\nA work of art is a logical system. It presupposes certain assumptions,\r\npostulates, conventions, which we must accept if we are to live in its\r\nworld. Now, in order that we may accept them, the artist must first\r\nhave vividly accepted them himself. Only if they have become a very\r\npart of him, can they become at all valid for us. The failure of\r\nclassicistic art in a non-classical age, of \"Pre-Raphaelitism\" after\r\nRaphael, is a failure in this--the artist has never lived even\r\nimaginatively in the world he depicts. His belief is an artifice and\r\na sham, and he cannot impose upon us with his pretense. But once we\r\nhave accepted the artist's postulates, then we are prepared to follow\r\nhim in his conclusions. In the Homeric world, we shall not balk at the\r\nintercourse between gods and men; in mediaeval painting and drama, we\r\nshall accept miracle; in _Alice in Wonderland_, we shall accept\r\nany dream-like enchantment. But we demand that the conclusions shall\r\nfollow from the premises, that the whole be consistent. We cannot\r\ntolerate miracle in a realistic novel or drama, or glaring inaccuracy\r\nof fact in a historical novel, because they are in contradiction to\r\nthe laws of reality tacitly assumed. The final demand which we make\r\nof any work, of art is that it live. What can be made to live for us\r\nmay be beautiful to us. But nothing can draw our life into itself which\r\nhas not drawn the artist's, or which is untrue to its own inner logic.\r\n\r\nOne of the most life-creating elements of a work of art is imagery.\r\nEverywhere in art the tendency exists for ideas to be filled out,\r\nrendered concrete and vivid, through images. In looking at a painting\r\nof a summer landscape, for example, we not only recognize the colors\r\nas meaning sunlight, but actually experience them as warm; in looking\r\nat a statue we not only recognize its surface as that of the body of\r\na woman, but we feel its softness and smoothness; which involves that\r\nthe ideas of sunlight and a human body, employed in interpreting the\r\nsensations received from these works of art, are developed back into\r\nthe original mass of images from which they were derived. However,\r\nalthough ideas are formed from images, they are not images,--as our\r\nordinary employment of them in recognizing objects attests. We may and\r\nusually do, for example, recognize a mirror as smooth without\r\nexperiencing it as smooth--the image equivalent of the idea remains\r\nlatent. Our ordinary experience with objects is too hasty and too\r\nintent on practical ends for images to develop. On the other hand, the\r\nleisurely attitude characteristic of the aesthetic experience is\r\nfavorable to the recall of images; hence, just as in the aesthetic\r\nperception of objects we put our feelings into them, so equally we\r\nimport into them the relevant images. The aesthetic reaction tends to\r\nbe total. Our demand for feeling in art also requires the image; for\r\nfeelings are more vividly attached to images than to abstract ideas.\r\nIt is a fact familiar in the experience of everybody that the strength\r\nof the emotional tone of an object is a function of the clearness of\r\nthe image which we form of it on recall. We can preserve the feeling\r\ntone of a past event or an absent object only if we can keep a vivid\r\nimage of it; as our image of it becomes vague, our interest in it\r\ndissipates. Everywhere in our experience the image mediates between\r\nfeeling and idea. So in art. Images have no more an independent and\r\nself-sufficient status in art than sensations have; like the latter\r\nthey are a means for the expression of feeling. In the painting of\r\nsunlight, for example, the images of warmth carry joyousness and a\r\nsense of ease; in the statue, the tactile images convey the emotional\r\nresponse to the represented object. In literature the expressiveness\r\nof images is perhaps even more impressive. Consider how longing is\r\naroused by the tactile, gustatory, and thermal images in the oft-quoted\r\nlines of Keats:--\r\n\r\n  O, for a draught of vintage! that hath been\r\n  Cool'd a long age in the deep-delved earth.\r\n\r\nExamples might be multiplied indefinitely.\r\n\r\nIn literature alone of the arts, images from all departments of sense\r\ncan be aroused. Visual images play a greater role there than in painting\r\nand sculpture, for the reason that, in the latter, visual sensations\r\ntake their place--we do not image what we can see. In sculpture, the\r\ngreater part of the imagery is of touch and motion--in the imagination,\r\nwe feel the surfaces and move with the represented motions; the\r\nwhiteness or blackness of the materials prevents the arousal of the\r\nimage of the color of the body. In painting, besides the temperature\r\nimages already mentioned, there are touch images--in still-life, for\r\nexample, when silks and furs are represented; images of odors, in\r\nflower pieces; of motion, in pictures which depict motion, as in the\r\nracing horses of Degas; of taste, in pictures of wine and fruit. Of\r\ncourse the kind and amount of imagery depend upon the imaginal type\r\nto which the spectator belongs and the wealth of the imaginal furnishing\r\nof his mind. In any art, moreover, the chief and requisite thing is\r\nexpression through the sense medium, which should never be obscured\r\nby expression through associated images. It is not the primary business\r\nof a flower painter to arouse images of perfume, but to compose colors\r\nand lines; nor the function of the musician to arouse the visual images\r\nwhich accompany the musical experience of many people, but to compose\r\nsounds. In sculpture, on the other hand, images of touch and movement\r\nplay an almost necessary part, for they are constituent elements in\r\nthe representation of form and motion; yet it is not indispensable to\r\nthe appreciation of sculpture that images of the sweet odor of the\r\nhuman body be awakened. The image is seldom the basis of aesthetic\r\nappreciation; it is more often its completion. But we shall go into\r\nthese matters more in detail in our special chapters.\r\n\r\nIn the representative arts, particularly painting and sculpture, the\r\nassociated images are fused with the visual sensations which constitute\r\nthe medium. I see the softness and sweet-odorousness of the painted\r\nrose petal, just as I see the real rose soft and sweet; I see the\r\nsurface of the statue firm and shapely, just as I see the human body\r\nso. This is because the ideas of the things represented in painting\r\nand sculpture seem to be actually present in the visual sensations\r\nwhich they interpret; the flower and the man seem to be there before\r\nme. In these arts, aesthetic perception is a fusion of image with\r\nsensation in much the way that normal perception is. In literature and\r\nmusic, on the other hand, the connection between the sense medium of\r\nthe art and the associated images is less close; and for the reason\r\nthat the sounds are no part of the things which they bring before the\r\nmind. In looking at a picture of a rose, I see the red as an element\r\nof the rose represented; whereas, in reading about a rose, I only seem\r\nto hear a voice describing it. In the latter case, therefore, the\r\nolfactory and visual images have a certain remoteness and independence\r\nof the word-sounds; I do not actually see and smell them in the sounds.\r\nHowever, in the case of familiar words with a strong emotional\r\nsignificance, the fusion of image with sound may be almost complete.\r\nWho, for example, does not see a sweet and red image of a rose into\r\nthe word-sounds when he reads:--\r\n\r\n  Oh, my love's like a red, red rose\r\n  That's newly sprung in June.\r\n\r\nOr, when Dante describes the _selva oscura_, who does not see the\r\ndarkness in the word _oscura_? In all such cases a strong feeling\r\ntone binds together the word-sound with the image. This fusion is most\r\nstriking in poetry because of the highly emotional material with which\r\nit works.\r\n\r\nThe ideas and images associated with a work of art depend very largely\r\non the education, experience, and idiosyncrasy of the spectator. The\r\nscholar, for example, will put tenfold more meaning into his reading\r\nof the _Divine Comedy_ than the untrained person. Or compare Pater's\r\ninterpretation of the \"Mona Lisa\" with Muther's. Can we say that certain\r\nideas and images belong properly to the work of art, while others do\r\nnot? With regard to this, we can, I think, set up two criteria. First,\r\nthe intention of the artist--whatever the artist meant his work to\r\nexpress: that it expresses. Yet, since this can never be certainly and\r\ncompletely discovered, there must always remain a large region of\r\nundetermined interpretation. Now for judging the relevancy of this\r\npenumbra of meaning and association the following test applies--does it\r\nbring us back to the sensuous medium of the work of art or lead us away?\r\nAnything is legitimate which we actually put into the form of the work\r\nof art and keep there, while whatever merely hangs loose around it is\r\nillegitimate. For example, if while listening to music we give ourselves\r\nup to personal memories and fancies, we are almost sure to neglect the\r\nsounds and their structure; we cannot objectify the former in the\r\nlatter; with the result that the composition is largely lost to us.\r\nNaturally, no hard and fast lines can be drawn, especially in the case\r\nof works of vague import like music; yet we can use this criterion as a\r\nprinciple for regulating and inhibiting our associations. It demands of\r\nus a wide-awake and receptive appreciation. The genuine meanings and\r\nassociations of a work of art are those which are the irresistible and\r\nnecessary results of the sense stimuli working upon an attentive\r\npercipient; the rest are not only arbitrary, but injurious.\r\n\r\nTo this, some people would doubtless object on the ground that art was\r\nmade for man and not man for art. The work of art, they would claim,\r\nshould interpret the personal experience of the spectator; hence\r\nwhatever he puts into it belongs there of right. There are, however,\r\ntwo considerations limiting the validity of this assertion. First, the\r\nwork of art is primarily an expression of the artist's personality\r\nand, second, its purpose is to provide a common medium of expression\r\nfor the experience of all men. If interpretation remains a purely\r\nindividual affair, both its relation to the artist and the possibility\r\nof a common aesthetic experience through it are destroyed. For this\r\nreason we should, I believe, deliberately seek to make our appreciations\r\nhistorically sound and definite. And in the social and historical\r\nappreciation resulting, we shall find our own lives--not so different\r\nfrom the artist's and our fellows'--abundantly and sufficiently\r\nexpressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE ANALYSIS OF THE AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE: THE STRUCTURE OF THE\r\nEXPERIENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our discussion of first principles, we set down a high degree of\r\nunity as one of the distinguishing characteristics of works of art.\r\nIn this we followed close upon ancient tradition; for the markedly\r\nstructural character of beauty was noticed by the earliest observers.\r\nPlato, the first philosopher of art, identified beauty with simplicity,\r\nharmony, and proportion, and Aristotle held the same view. They were\r\nso impressed with aesthetic unity that they compared it with the other\r\nmost highly unified type of thing they knew, the organism; and ever\r\nafterwards it has been called \"organic unity.\" With the backing of\r\nsuch authority, unity in variety was long thought to be the same as\r\nbeauty; and, although this view is obviously one-sided, no one has\r\nsince succeeded in persuading men that an object can be beautiful\r\nwithout unity.\r\n\r\nSince art is expression, its unity is, unavoidably, an image of the\r\nunity of the things in nature and mind which it expresses. A lyric\r\npoem reflects the unity of mood that binds together the thoughts and\r\nimages of the poet; the drama and novel, the unity of plan and purpose\r\nin the acts of men and the fateful sequence of causes and effects in\r\ntheir lives. The statue reflects the organic unity of the body; the\r\npainting, the spatial unity of visible things. In beautiful artifacts,\r\nthe basal unity is the purpose or end embodied in the material\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nBut the unity of works of art is not wholly derivative; for it occurs\r\nin the free arts like music, where nothing is imitated, and even in\r\nthe representative arts, as we have observed, it is closer than in the\r\nthings which are imaged. Aesthetic unity is therefore unique and, if\r\nwe would understand it, we must seek its reason in the peculiar nature\r\nand purpose of art. Since, moreover, art is a complex fact, the\r\nexplanation of its unity is not simple; the unity itself is very\r\nintricate and depends upon many cooperating factors.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the imitative arts, taking the given unity of the objects\r\nrepresented as a basis, the superior unity of the image is partly due\r\nto the singleness of the artist's interest. For art, as we know, is\r\nnever the expression of mere things, but of things so far as they have\r\nvalue. Out of the infinite fullness of nature and of life, the artist\r\nselects those elements that have a unique significance for him.\r\n\r\n  Music, when soft voices die,\r\n  Vibrates in the memory;\r\n  Odors, when sweet violets sicken,\r\n  Live within the sense they quicken;\r\n  Rose leaves, when the rose is dead,\r\n  Are heaped for the beloved's bed;\r\n  And so thy thoughts when thou art gone,\r\n  Love itself shall slumber on.\r\n\r\nObserve how, out of the countless things which he knows, the poet has\r\nchosen those which he feels akin to his faith in the immortality of\r\nlove. The painter would not, if he could, reproduce all the elements\r\nof a face, but only those that are expressive of the interpretation\r\nof character he wishes to convey. The novelist and the dramatist proceed\r\nin a like selective fashion in the treatment of their material. In the\r\nlives of men there are a thousand actions and events--casual spoken\r\nwords, recurrent processes such as eating and dressing, hours of\r\nidleness and futility which, because repetitious, habitual, or\r\ninconsequential, throw no light upon that alone in which we are\r\ninterested,--character and fortune. To describe a single example of\r\nthese facts suffices. In the novel and drama, therefore, the\r\npersonalities and life histories of men have a simplicity and singleness\r\nof direction not found in reality. The artist seeks everywhere the\r\ntraits that individualize and characterize, and neglects all others.\r\n\r\nMoreover, since the aim of art is to afford pleasure in the intuition\r\nof life, the artist will try to reveal the hidden unities that so\r\ndelight the mind to discover. He will aim to penetrate beneath the\r\nsurface of experience observed by common perception, to its more obscure\r\nlogic underneath. In this way he will go beyond what the mere mechanism\r\nof imitation requires. The poet, for example, manifests latent emotional\r\nharmonies among the most widely sundered things. The subtle novelist\r\nshows how single elements of character, apparently isolated acts or\r\ntrivial incidents, are fateful of consequences. He discloses the minute\r\nreactions of one personality upon another. Or he enters into the soul\r\nof man himself, into his private and individual selfhood, and uncovers\r\nthe hidden connections between thought and feeling and impulse. Finally,\r\nhe may take the wider sweep of society and tradition into view and\r\ntrack out their part in the molding of man and his fate. In the search\r\nfor unity, the artist is on common ground with the man of science; but\r\nwith this difference: the artist is concerned with laws operating in\r\nconcrete, individual things in which he is interested; while the\r\nscientist formulates them in the abstract. For the artist, unity is\r\nvaluable as characterizing a significant individual; for the scientist,\r\nit is valuable in itself, and the individual only as an example of it.\r\n\r\nThis same purpose of affording pleasure in sympathetic vision leads\r\nthe artist not only to present the unity of life, but so to organize\r\nits material that it will be clear to the mind which perceives it. Too\r\ngreat a multitude of elements, elements that are not assorted into\r\ngroups and tied by relations or principles, cannot be grasped. Hence\r\nthe artist infuses into the world which he creates a new and wholly\r\nsubjective simplicity and unity, to which there is no parallel in\r\nnature. The composition of elements in a picture does not correspond\r\nto any actual arrangement of elements in a landscape, but to the demands\r\nof visual perspicuity. The division of a novel into chapters, of the\r\nchapters into paragraphs, of the paragraphs into sentences, although\r\nit may answer in some measure to the objective divisions of the\r\nlife-story related, corresponds much more closely to the subjective\r\nneed for ready apprehension. The artist meets this need halfway in the\r\norganization of the material which he presents. Full beauty depends\r\nupon an adaptation of the object to the senses, attention, and synthetic\r\nfunctions of the mind. The long, rambling novel of the eighteenth\r\ncentury is a more faithful image of the fullness and diversity of life,\r\nbut it answers ill to the limited sweep of the mind, its proneness to\r\nfatigue, and its craving for wholeness of view.\r\n\r\nBut even all the reasons so far invoked--the necessity for significance,\r\nthe interest in unity, the demand for perspicuity--do not, I think,\r\nsuffice to explain the structure of works of art. For structure has,\r\noftentimes, a direct emotional appeal, which has not yet been taken\r\ninto account, and which is a leading motive for its presence. Consider,\r\nfor example, symmetry. A symmetrical disposition of parts is indeed\r\nfavorable to perspicuity; for it is easier to find on either side what\r\nwe have already found on the other, the sight of one side preparing\r\nus for the sight of the other; and such an arrangement is flattering\r\nto our craving for unity, for we rejoice seeing the same pattern\r\nexpressed in the two parts; yet the experience of symmetry is richer\r\nstill: it includes an agreeable feeling of balance, steadfastness,\r\nstability. This is most evident in the case of visual objects, like\r\na Greek vase, where there is a plain division between right and left\r\nsimilar halves; but it is also felt in music when there is a balance\r\nof themes in the earlier and later parts of a composition, and in\r\nliterature in the well-balanced sentence, paragraph, or poem. To cite\r\nthe very simplest example, if I read, \"on the one hand ... on the other\r\nhand,\" I have a feeling of balanced tensions precisely analogous to\r\nwhat I experience when I look at a vase. Structure is not a purely\r\nintellectual or perceptive affair; it is also motor and organic, and\r\nthat means emotional. It is felt with the body as well as understood\r\nby the mind. I have used the case of symmetry to bring out this truth,\r\nbut I might have used other types of unification, each of which has\r\nits unique feeling tone, as I shall show presently, after I have\r\nanalyzed them.\r\n\r\nKeeping in mind the motives which explain the structure of works of\r\nart, I wish now to distinguish and describe the chief types. There\r\nare, I think, three of these, of which each one may include important\r\nspecial forms--unity in variety, dominance, and equilibrium.\r\n\r\nUnity in variety was the earliest of the types to be observed and is\r\nthe most fundamental. It is the organic unity so often referred to in\r\ncriticism. It involves, in the first place, wholeness or individuality.\r\nEvery work of art is a definite single thing, distinct and separate\r\nfrom other things, and not divisible into parts which are themselves\r\ncomplete works of art. No part can be taken away without damage to the\r\nwhole, and when taken out of the whole, the part loses much of its own\r\nvalue. The whole needs all of its parts and they need it; \"there they\r\nlive and move and have their being.\" The unity is a unity of the variety\r\nand the variety is a differentiation of the unity.[Footnote: Cf. Lipps:\r\n_Aesthetik_, Bd. I, Drittes Kapitel.] The variety is of equal\r\nimportance with the unity, for unity can assert itself and work only\r\nthrough the control of a multiplicity of elements. The analogy between\r\nthe unity of the work of art and the unity of the organism is still\r\nthe most accurate and illuminating. For, like the work of art, the\r\nbody is a self-sufficient and distinctive whole, whose unified life\r\ndepends upon the functioning of many members, which, for their part,\r\nare dead when cut away from it.\r\n\r\nThe conception of unity in variety as organic represents an ideal or\r\nnorm for art, which is only imperfectly realized in many works. There\r\nare few novels which would be seriously damaged by the omission of\r\nwhole chapters, and many a rambling essay in good standing would permit\r\npruning without injury, unless indeed we are made to feel that the\r\napparently dispensable material really contributes something of fullness\r\nand exuberance, and so is not superfluous, after all. The unity in\r\nsome forms of art is tighter than in others; in a play closer than in\r\na novel; in a sonnet more compact than in an epic. In extreme examples,\r\nlike _The Thousand and One Nights,_ the _Decameron,_ the _Canterbury\r\nTales,_ the unity is almost wholly nominal, and the work is really a\r\ncollection, not a whole. With all admissions, it remains true, however,\r\nthat offenses against the principle of unity in variety diminish the\r\naesthetic value of a work. These offenses are of two kinds--the\r\ninclusion of the genuinely irrelevant, and multiple unity, like double\r\ncomposition in a picture, or ambiguity of style in a building. There may\r\nbe two or more parallel lines of action in a play or a novel, two or\r\nmore themes in music, but they must be interwoven and interdependent.\r\nOtherwise there occurs the phenomenon aptly called by Lipps \"aesthetic\r\nrivalry\"--each part claims to be the whole and to exclude its neighbor;\r\nyet being unable to do this, suffers injury through divided attention.\r\n\r\nUnity in variety may exist in any one or more of three modes--the\r\nharmony or union of cooperating elements; the balance of contrasting\r\nor conflicting elements; the development or evolution of a process\r\ntowards an end or climax. The first two are predominantly static or\r\nspatial; the last, dynamic and temporal. I know of no better way of\r\nindicating the characteristic quality of each than by citing examples.\r\n\r\nAesthetic harmony exists whenever some identical quality or form or\r\npurpose is embodied in various elements of a whole--sameness in\r\ndifference. The repetition of the same space-form in architecture,\r\nlike the round arch and window in the Roman style; the recurrence of\r\nthe same motive in music; the use of a single hue to color the different\r\nobjects in a painting, as in a nocturne of Whistler: these are simple\r\nillustrations of harmony. An almost equally simple case is gradation\r\nor lawful change of quality in space and time--the increase or decrease\r\nof loudness in music of saturation or brightness of hue in painting,\r\nthe gentle change of direction of a curved line. In these cases there\r\nis, of course, a dynamic or dramatic effect, if you take the elements\r\nin sequence; but when taken simultaneously and together, they are a\r\nharmony, not a development. Simplest of all is the harmony between\r\nlike parts of regular figures, such as squares and circles; or between\r\ncolors which are neighboring in hue. Harmonious also are characters\r\nin a story or play which are united by feelings of love, friendship,\r\nor loyalty. Thus there is harmony between Hamlet and Horatio, or between\r\nthe Cid and his followers.\r\n\r\nAesthetic balance is the unity between elements which, while they\r\noppose or conflict with one another, nevertheless need or supplement\r\neach other. Hostile things, enemies at war, business men that compete,\r\npersons that hate each other, have as great a need of their opponents,\r\nin order that there may be a certain type of life, as friends have,\r\nin order that there may be love between them; and in relation to each\r\nother they create a whole in the one case as in the other. There is\r\nas genuine a unity between contrasting colors and musical themes as\r\nthere is between colors closely allied in hue or themes simply\r\ntransposed in key. Contrasting elements are always the extremes of\r\nsome series, and are unified, despite the contrast, because they\r\nsupplement each other. Things merely different, no matter how different,\r\ncannot contrast, for there must be some underlying whole, to which\r\nboth belong, in which they are unified. In order that this unity may\r\nbe felt, it is often necessary to avoid absolute extremes, or at least\r\nto mediate between them. Among colors, for example, hues somewhat\r\ncloser than the complementary are preferred to the latter, or, if the\r\nextremes are employed, each one leads up to the other through\r\nintermediate hues. The unity of contrasting colors is a balance because,\r\nas extremes, they take an equal hold on the attention. The well-known\r\naccentuation of contrasting elements does not interfere with the\r\nbalance, because it is mutual. A balanced unity is also created by\r\ncontrasts of character, as in Goethe's _Tasso_, or by a conflict\r\nbetween social classes or parties, as in Hauptmann's _Die Weber_.\r\nBalanced, finally, is the unity between the elements of a painting,\r\nright and left, which draw the attention in opposite directions. The\r\nthird type of unity appears in any process or sequence in which all\r\nthe elements, one after another, contribute towards the bringing about\r\nof some end or result. It is the unity characteristic of all\r\nteleologically related facts. The sequence cannot be a mere succession\r\nor even a simple causal series, but must also be purposive, because,\r\nin order to be aesthetic, the goal which is reached must have value.\r\nCausality is an important aspect of this type of unity, as in the\r\ndrama, but only because a teleological series of actions depends upon\r\na chain of causally related means and ends. The type is of two\r\nvarieties: in the one, the movement is smooth, each element being\r\nharmoniously related to the last; in the other, it is difficult and\r\ndramatic, proceeding through the resolution of oppositions among its\r\nelements. The movement usually has three stages: an initial phase of\r\nintroduction and preparation; a second phase of opposition and\r\ncomplication; then a final one, the climax or catastrophe, when the\r\ngoal is reached; there may also be a fourth,--the working out of the\r\nconsequences of this last. Illustrations of this mode of unity are:\r\nthe course of a story or a play from the introduction of the characters\r\nand the complication of the plot to the denouement or solving of the\r\nproblem; the development of a character in a novel from a state of\r\nsimplicity or innocence through storm and stress into maturity or ruin;\r\nthe evolution of a sentiment in a sonnet towards its final statement\r\nin the last line or two; the melody, in its departure from the keynote,\r\nits going forth and return; the career of a line.\r\n\r\nAs I have indicated before, each type of unity has its specific\r\nemotional quality. The very word harmony which we use to denote the\r\nfirst mode is itself connotative of a way of being affected, of being\r\nmoved emotionally. The mood of this mode is quiet, oneness, peace. We\r\nfeel as if we were closely and compactly put together. If now, within\r\nthe aesthetic whole, we emphasize the variety, we begin to lose the\r\nmood of peace; tensions arise, until, in the case of contrast and\r\nopposition, there is a feeling of conflict and division in the self;\r\nyet without loss of unity, because, if the whole is aesthetic, each of\r\nthe opposing elements demands the other; hence there is balance between\r\nthem, and this also we not only know to be there, but feel there. The\r\ncharacteristic mood of the evolutionary type of unity is equally\r\nunique--either a sense of easy motion, when the process is unobstructed,\r\nor excitement and breathlessness, when there is opposition.\r\n\r\nThe different types of unity are by no means exclusive of each other\r\nand are usually found together in any complex work of art. Symmetry\r\nusually involves a combination of harmony and balance. The symmetrical\r\nhalves of a Greek vase, for example, are harmonious in so far as their\r\nsize and shape are the same, yet balanced as being disposed in opposite\r\ndirections, right and left. Rhythm is temporal symmetry, and so also\r\nrepresents a combination of harmony and balance. Static rhythm is only\r\napparent; for in every seeming case, the rhythm really pervades the\r\nsuccession of acts of attention to the elements rather than the elements\r\nthemselves; a colonnade, for example, is rhythmical only when the\r\nattention moves from one column to another. There is harmony in rhythm,\r\nfor there is always some law--metrical scheme in poetry, time in music,\r\nsimilarity of column and equality of interval between them in a\r\ncolonnade--pervading the elements. But there is also balance; for as\r\nthe elements enter the mind one after the other, there is rivalry\r\nbetween the element now occupying the focus of the attention and the\r\none that is about to present an equal claim to this position. Because\r\nof its intrinsic value, we tend to hold on to each element as we hear\r\nor see it, but are forced to relinquish it for the sake of the one\r\nthat follows; only for a moment can we keep both in the conscious span;\r\nthe recurrence and overcoming of the resulting tension, as we follow\r\nthe succession through, creates the pulsation so characteristic of\r\nrhythm. The opposition of the elements as in turn they crowd each other\r\nout does not, however, interfere with the harmony, for they have an\r\nexistence all together in memory, where the law binding them can be\r\nfelt,--a law which each element as it comes into consciousness is\r\nrecognized as fulfilling. Since we usually look forward to the end of\r\nthe rhythmical movement as a goal, rhythm often exists in combination\r\nwith evolution, and is therefore the most inclusive of all artistic\r\nstructural forms. In a poem, for example, the metrical rhythm is a\r\nframework overlying the development of the thought. Dramatic unity is\r\nfound combined with balance even in the static arts, as, for example,\r\nin the combination of blue and gold, where the balance is not quite\r\nequal, because of a slight movement from the blue to the more brilliant\r\nand striking gold. I have already shown how harmony, opposition, and\r\nevolution may be combined in a melody. In the drama, also, all three\r\nare present. There is a balance of opposing and conflicting wills or\r\nforces; this is unstable; whence movement follows, leading on to the\r\ncatastrophe, where the problem is solved; and throughout there is a\r\nsingle mood or atmosphere in which all participate, creating an\r\nenveloping harmony despite the tension and action. And other\r\nillustrations of combinations of types will come to the mind of every\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nEach form of unity has its difficulties and dangers, which must be\r\navoided if perfection is to be attained. In harmony there may be too\r\nmuch identity and too little difference or variety, with the result\r\nthat the whole becomes tedious and uninteresting. This is the fault\r\nof rigid symmetry and of all other simple geometrical types of\r\ncomposition, which, for this reason, have lost their old popularity\r\nin the decorative and pictorial arts. In balance, on the other hand,\r\nthe danger is that there may be too great a variety, too strong an\r\nopposition; the elements tend to fly apart, threatening the integrity\r\nof the whole. For it is not sufficient that wholeness exist in a work\r\nof art; it must also be felt. For example, in Pre-Raphaelite paintings\r\nand in most of the Secession work of our own day, the color contrasts\r\nare too strong; there is no impression of visual unity. In the dramatic\r\ntype of unity there are two chief dangers--that the evolution be\r\ntortuous, so that we lose our way in its bypaths and mazes; or, on the\r\nother hand, that the end be reached too simply and quickly; in the one\r\ncase, we lose heart for the journey because of the obstacles; in the\r\nother, we lose interest and are bored for want of incidents.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the second great principle of aesthetic structure--\r\nDominance.[Footnote: Cf. Lipps: _Aesthetik_, Bd. I, S. 53, Viertes\r\nKapitel] In an aesthetic whole the elements are seldom all on a level;\r\nsome are superior, others subordinate. The unity is mediated through\r\none or more accented elements, through which the whole comes to emphatic\r\nexpression. The attention is not evenly distributed among the parts,\r\nbut proceeds from certain ones which are focal and commanding to others\r\nwhich are of lesser interest. And the dominant elements are not only\r\nsuperior in significance; they are, in addition, representative of the\r\nwhole; in them, its value is concentrated; they are the key by means\r\nof which its structure can be understood. They are like good rulers\r\nin a constitutional state, who are at once preeminent members of the\r\ncommunity and signal embodiments of the common will. Anything which\r\ndistinguishes and makes representative of the whole serves to make\r\ndominant. In a well-constructed play there are one or more characters\r\nwhich are central to the action, in whom the spirit and problem of the\r\npiece are embodied, as Hamlet in _Hamlet_ and Brand in _Brand_; in every\r\nplot there is the catastrophe or turning point, for which every\r\npreceding incident is a preparation, and of which every following one is\r\na consequent; in a melody there is the keynote; in the larger\r\ncomposition there are the one or more themes whose working out is the\r\npiece; in a picture there are certain elements which especially attract\r\nthe attention, about which the others are composed. In the more complex\r\nrhythms, in meters, for example, the elements are grouped around the\r\naccented ones. In an aesthetic whole there are certain qualities and\r\npositions which, because of their claim upon the attention, tend to make\r\ndominant any elements which possess them. In space-forms the center and\r\nthe edges are naturally places of preeminence. The eye falls first upon\r\nthe center and then is drawn away to the boundaries. In old pictures,\r\nthe Madonna or Christ is placed in the center and the angels near the\r\nperimeter; in fancy work it is the center and the border which women\r\nembroider. In time, the beginning, middle, and end are the natural\r\nplaces of importance; the beginning, because there the attention is\r\nfresh and expectant; towards the middle, because there we tend to rest,\r\nlooking backward to the commencement and forward to the end; the end\r\nitself, because being last in the mind, its hold upon the memory is\r\nfirmest. In any process the beginning is important as the start, the\r\nplan, the preparation; the middle as the climax and turning point; the\r\nend as the consummation. Of course by the middle is not meant a\r\nmathematical point of division into equal parts, but a psychological\r\npoint, which is usually nearer the end, because the impetus of action\r\nand purpose carry forward and beyond. Thus in a plot the beginning\r\nstands out as setting the problem and introducing the characters and\r\nsituation; then the movement of the action, gathering force increasingly\r\nas it proceeds, breaks at some point well beyond the middle; in the last\r\npart the problem is solved and the consequences of the action are\r\nrevealed. Large size is another quality which distinguishes and tends to\r\nmake dominant, as in the tower and the mountain. In one of Memling's\r\npaintings, \"St. Ursula and the Maidens,\" which, when I saw it, was in\r\nBruges, the lady is represented twice as tall as the full grown girls\r\nwhom she envelops in her protecting cloak; yet, despite the\r\nunnaturalness, we do not experience any incongruity; for it is rational\r\nto our feeling. Intensity of any sort is another property which creates\r\ndominance--loudness of sound in music; concentration of light in\r\npainting, as in Rembrandt; stress in rhythm; depth and scope of purpose\r\nand feeling, as in the great characters of fiction. The effectiveness of\r\nintensity may be greatly increased through contrast--the pianissimo\r\nafter the fortissimo; the pathos of the fifth act of _Hamlet_ set off by\r\nthe comedy of the first scene. Sometimes all the natural qualifications\r\nof eminence are united in a single work: in old paintings, for example,\r\nthe Christ Child, spiritually the most significant element of the whole,\r\nwill be of supernatural size, will occupy the center of the picture,\r\nwill have the light concentrated upon him, and will be dressed in\r\nbrightly gleaming garments.\r\n\r\nAs I have already indicated, there may be more than one dominant\r\nelement; for instance, two or more principal characters in a novel or\r\nplay--Lord and Lady Macbeth, Sancho and Don Quixote, Othello and\r\nDesdemona, Brand and his wife. In this case, there must be either\r\nsubordination among them, a hierarchical arrangement; or else\r\nreciprocity or balance, as in the illustrations cited, where it is\r\ndifficult to tell which is the more important of the two; otherwise\r\nthey would pull the whole apart. The advantage of several dominant\r\nelements lies in the greater animation, and when the work is large,\r\nin the superior organization, which they confer. In order that there\r\nmay be perspicuity, it is necessary, when there are many elements,\r\nthat they be separated into minor groups around high points which\r\nindividualize and represent them, and so take their place in the mind,\r\nmediating between them and unity when a final synthesis of the whole\r\nis to be made.\r\n\r\nThe third great principle of aesthetic structure is equilibrium or\r\nimpartiality. This is a principle counteracting dominance. It demands,\r\ndespite the subordination among the elements, that none be neglected.\r\nEach, no matter how minor its part in the whole, must have some unique\r\nvalue of its own, must be an end as well as a means. Dominance is the\r\naristocratic principle in art, the rule of the best; this is the\r\ndemocratic principle, the demand for freedom and significance for all.\r\nJust as, in a well-ordered state, the happiness of no individual or\r\nclass of individuals is sacrificed to that of other individuals or\r\nclasses; so in art, each part must be elaborated and perfected, not\r\nmerely for the sake of its contribution to the whole, but for its own\r\nsake. There should be no mere figure-heads or machinery. Loving care\r\nof detail, of the incidental, characterizes the best art.\r\n\r\nOf course this principle, like the others, is an ideal or norm, which\r\nis only imperfectly realized in many works of art. Many a poet finds\r\nit necessary to fill in his lines and many a painter and musician does\r\nthe like with his pictures or compositions. There is much mere\r\nscaffolding and many lay-figures in drama and novel. But the work of\r\nthe masters is different. There each line or stroke or musical phrase,\r\neach character or incident, is unique or meaningful. The greatest\r\nexample of this is perhaps the _Divine Comedy_, where each of the\r\nhundred cantos and each line of each canto is perfect in workmanship\r\nand packed with significance. There is, of course, a limit to this\r\nelaboration of the parts, set by the demands for unity and wholeness.\r\nThe individuality of the elements must not be so great that we rest\r\nin them severally, caring little or nothing for their relations to one\r\nanother and to the whole. The contribution of this principle is\r\nrichness. Unity in variety gives wholeness; dominance, order;\r\nequilibrium, wealth, interest, vitality.\r\n\r\nThe structure of works of art is even more complicated than would\r\nappear from the description given thus far. For there is not only the\r\nunity of the elements among themselves, but between the two aspects\r\nof each element and of the whole--the form and content. This--the unity\r\nbetween the sense medium and whatever of thought and feeling is embodied\r\nin it--is the fundamental unity in all expression. It is the unity\r\nbetween a word and its meaning, a musical tone and its mood, a color\r\nand shape and what they represent. Since, however, it is indispensable\r\nto all expression, it is not peculiar to art. And to a large extent,\r\neven in the creative work of the artist, this unity is given, not made;\r\nthe very materials of the artist consisting of elementary\r\nexpressions--words, tones, colors, space-forms--in which the unity of\r\nform and content has already been achieved, either by an innate\r\npsycho-physical process, as is the case with tones and simple rhythms,\r\nor by association and habit, as is the case with the words of any\r\nnatural language, or the object-meanings which we attach to colors\r\nand shapes. The poet does not work with sounds, but with words which\r\nalready have their definite meanings; his creation consists of the\r\nlarger whole into which he weaves them. Of course, even in the case\r\nof ordinary verbal expression, the thought often comes first before\r\nits clothing in words, when there is a certain process of choice and\r\nfitting; and in painting there is always the possibility of varying\r\nconventional forms; yet even so, in large measure, the elements of the\r\narts are themselves expressions, in which a unity of form and content\r\nalready exists.\r\n\r\nIn art, however, there are subtler aspects to the relation between\r\nform and content, and these have a unique aesthetic significance. For\r\nthere, as we know, the elements of the medium, colors and lines and\r\nsounds, and the patterns of these, their harmonies and structures and\r\nrhythms, are expressive, in a vague way, of feeling; hence, when the\r\nartist employs them as embodiments of his ideas, he has to select them,\r\nnot only as carriers of meaning, but as communications of mood. Now,\r\nin order that his selection be appropriate, it is clearly necessary\r\nthat the feeling tone of the form be identical with that of the content\r\nwhich he puts into it. The medium as such must reexpress and so enforce\r\nthe values of the content. This is the \"harmony,\" as distinguished\r\nfrom the mere unity, of form and content, the existence of which in\r\nart is one of its distinguishing properties. I have already called\r\nattention to this in our second chapter. It involves, as we observed,\r\nthat in painting, for example, the feeling tone of the colors and lines\r\nshould be identical with that of the objects to be represented; in\r\npoetry, that the emotional quality of meter and rhythm should be attuned\r\nto the incidents and sentiments expressed. Otherwise the effect is\r\nugly or comical.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to the work of art, this harmony is already achieved. But\r\nfor the artist it is something delicately to be worked out. Yet, just\r\nas in ordinary expression form and content often emerge in unison, the\r\nthought itself being a word and the word a thought; so in artistic\r\ncreation, the mother mood out of which the creative act springs, finds\r\nimmediate and forthright embodiment in a congenial form. Such a\r\nspontaneous and perfect balance of matter and form is, however, seldom\r\nachieved without long and painful experimentation and practice, both\r\nby the artist himself in his own private work, and by his predecessors,\r\nwhose results he appropriates. Large traditional and oftentimes rigid\r\nforms, such as the common metrical and musical schemes and architectural\r\norders, into which the personal matter of expression may aptly fall,\r\nare thus elaborated in every art. As against every looser and novel\r\nform, they have the advantages first, of being more readily and steadily\r\nheld in the memory, where they may gather new and poignant associations;\r\nsecond, of coming to us already freighted with similar associations\r\nout of the past; and last, of compelling the artist, in order that he\r\nmay fit his inspiration into them, to purify it of all irrelevant\r\nsubstance. Impatient artists rebel against forms, but wise ones either\r\naccommodate their genius to them, until they become in the end a second\r\nand equally spontaneous nature, or else create new forms, as definite\r\nas the old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEM OF EVIL IN AESTHETICS, AND ITS SOLUTION THROUGH THE TRAGIC,\r\nPATHETIC, AND COMIC\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, in our third chapter, we defined the purpose of art, we indicated\r\nthat it was broad enough to include the expression of evil, but we did\r\nnot show in detail how this was possible. That is our present theme.\r\n\r\nArt is sympathetic representation; the effort not only to reveal an\r\nobject to us, but to unite us with it. The artist finds no difficulty\r\nin accomplishing this purpose with reference to one class of\r\nobjects--those which, apart from portrayal, we call beautiful. To these\r\nwe are drawn immediately because they serve directly the ends of life.\r\nNature sees to it that we dwell with pleasure on the sight of healthy\r\nchildren, well-grown women, and bountiful landscapes. And to the\r\nrepresentations of such objects we are attracted by the same instincts\r\nthat attract us to the things themselves. No special power of art is\r\nrequired that we take delight in them; the task of the artist is half\r\naccomplished before he begins. Yet the scope of art is wider than this,\r\nfor it represents evil as well as good. Death as well as life, sickness\r\nand deformity as well as health, suffering as well as joy, sin equally\r\nwith goodness, come within its purview. And these also it not only\r\nreveals to us but makes good to know, so good in fact that they are\r\nperhaps the preferred objects of artistic representation. But instead\r\nof being able to rely on instincts that would draw us to these objects,\r\nart has to overcome those that would lead us away from them. It has\r\nto conquer our natural horror at death, pain at suffering, and revulsion\r\nagainst wickedness. How does it? That is the problem of evil in\r\nsthetics.\r\n\r\nThere are many means by which this problem is solved. In the first\r\nplace, the mere fact that art is representation and not reality does\r\nmuch toward overcoming any feelings of moral or physical repugnance\r\nwe might have toward the objects represented. These feelings exist for\r\nthe sake of action; hence, when action is impossible--and we cannot\r\nact on the unreal--although they may still persist, they become less\r\nstrong. Toward the merely imaginary, the practical and moral attitudes,\r\nwhich towards the real would lead to condemnation and withdrawal, lose\r\ntheir relevance and tend to disappear. That is one of the advantages\r\nof art over the more immediate perception of life. It is difficult to\r\ntake a purely aesthetic attitude towards all of life, to seek only to\r\nget into sympathetic contact with it for the sake of an inner\r\nrealization of what it is; much of it touches us too closely on the\r\nside of our practical and moral interests. A certain man, for example,\r\ndoes not belong to our set, or his ways are so bohemian that it would\r\nimperil our social position or the safety of our souls to get acquainted\r\nwith him; so we reject him and cast him into the outer darkness of our\r\ndisapproval--or he rejects us. Such a person, we feel, is to be avoided\r\nor haply, if we be saints, to be saved from himself; but not to be\r\naccepted and understood. And even if we succeed in freeing ourselves\r\nfrom the moral point of view, we are still preoccupied with the\r\npractical, if the man happens to interest us commercially; we have not\r\nthe time nor the desire to see his nature as a whole. Not so in art.\r\nAs a character in a novel, a man cannot be employed; nor can it be a\r\nhazard to keep company with him; and his soul is surely beyond our\r\nsaving; the only thing left for us to do is to sympathize with and try\r\nto understand him, to enter into communion with his spirit. By freeing\r\nlife from the practical and moral, art gives the imagination full sway.\r\nThis, to be sure, is only a negative force working in the direction\r\nof beauty, yet is important none the less because it enables the more\r\npositive influences to function easily.\r\n\r\nOne of these is what I would call \"sympathetic curiosity,\" which may\r\nencompass all images of life. Things which, if met with in life, would\r\ncertainly repel, when presented in image, simply excite our curiosity\r\nto know. Of course some are impelled by the same interest to get into\r\ncontact with all experience--_Homo sum: humani nihil alienum a me\r\nputo_--yet with the great majority the impulses to withdraw are too\r\nstrong. But all have a desire for further knowledge when a mere idea\r\nof human life, however repellent, is presented; for the instinct of\r\ngregariousness, which creates a special interest in our kind, works\r\nwith full force in the mind to strengthen curiosity. There is no part\r\nof human experience which it does not embrace. We can well forego\r\nknowledge of stars and trees, but we cannot remain ignorant of anything\r\nhuman. As the moth to the flame, we are led, even against our will,\r\ninto all of life, even the most unpleasant. The charm possessed by the\r\nnovel and unplumbed, by such stories as _Jude the Obscure_, or by the\r\nweird imaginings of a Baudelaire, comes from this source. It is no mere\r\nscientific curiosity, because it includes that \"consciousness of kind,\"\r\nwhich makes us feel akin to all we know.\r\n\r\nSympathetic curiosity, however, seldom works alone, for other interests,\r\nless worthy and therefore often unavowed, usually cooperate to overcome\r\nour repugnances towards the unpleasant. Many of our repugnances are\r\nnot simple and original like those felt towards death, darkness, and\r\ndeformity, but highly complex products of education, which may be\r\ndissolved by a strong appeal to the more primitive instincts which\r\nthey seek to repress. An artist may, for example, through a vivid\r\nportrayal, so excite the animal lust and cruelty which lurk hidden in\r\nall of us as to make the most morally reprehensible objects acceptable.\r\nNature has taken many a revenge on civilization through art. Although\r\nno one should demand that these appeals be entirely excluded, yet when\r\nthey operate alone, without the sublimation of insight, they are\r\nflagrantly unaesthetic in their influence, because they deprive the\r\nwork of art of its freedom.\r\n\r\nAnother means which the artist may employ in order to win us is the\r\nappeal of sense. However repellent be the objects which he represents,\r\nif he can clothe them in a sensuous material which will charm us, he\r\nwill have exerted a powerful countervailing force. We have already had\r\noccasion to observe this in our first chapter. Through the call of\r\nsense we are invited to enter and are made welcome at the very threshold\r\nof the work of art. Engaging lines, winsome colors and tones, and\r\ncompelling rhythms can overcome almost any repugnance that we might\r\notherwise feel for the subject-matter. Their primary appeals are\r\nsuperior to all the reservations of civilization. No wonder that the\r\nstern moralists who would keep beauty for the clean and holy have been\r\nafraid of art! Yet the delight of sense, because its emotional effect\r\nis diffused, does not interfere with the contemplative serenity of\r\nart, as unbridled passion does; it even quiets passion by diverting\r\nthe attention to itself; hence may always be employed by the artist.\r\nA good example of the aesthetic fascination of sensation is Von Stuck's\r\n\"Salome\" in the Art Institute of Chicago. For all normal feeling,\r\nSalome dancing with the head of John the Baptist is a revolting object;\r\nyet how beautiful the artist has made his picture through the simple\r\nloveliness of gold and red!\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake, however, to infer the indifference of the\r\nsubject-matter in art. The creation of a work of art is based on a\r\nprimary aesthetic experience of nature or human life, and not everything\r\nis capable of producing such an experience in all men. The subject\r\nmust be one towards which the artist or spectator is able to take the\r\nsthetic attitude of emotional, yet free, perception. Some people are\r\nunable to lay aside their moral prepossessions towards certain phases\r\nof life or even towards representation of them; the idea affects them\r\nas would the reality. For such people even the genius of a Beardsley\r\nis too feeble to create an experience of beauty out of the material\r\nwith which he works. Or again, some people cannot objectify their\r\nsensual egotistic impulses and feelings; for them the reading of a\r\nBoccaccio, for example, is only a substitute for such feelings, not\r\na means of insight into them. It requires a robust intellectual\r\nattitude, a predominance of mind over feeling and instinct, aesthetically\r\nto appreciate some works of art. But for those who can receive it, the\r\nrepresentation of any phase of life may afford an aesthetic experience,\r\nmay create a thing good to know, if only it be mastered by the mind\r\nand embodied in a charming form.\r\n\r\nThe charm of sense together with the satisfaction of insight are\r\nsufficient to explain the conquest of evil by art. Yet further means\r\nhave been employed--the special appeals of the tragic, pathetic, and\r\ncomic.\r\n\r\nWhat any one may mean by tragic is largely a matter of personal\r\ndefinition or tradition; yet there is, I think, a common essence upon\r\nwhich all would agree. First, tragedy always involves the manful\r\nstruggle of a personality in the pursuit of some end, at the cost of\r\nsuffering, perhaps of death and failure. The opposition may come from\r\nnature, as in _The Grammarian's Funeral_; from fate, as in the\r\n_Oedipus_; from social and political interests, as in _Antigone_; that\r\nis of little moment; it is important solely that the battle be accepted\r\nand waged unflinchingly to the issue. In this ultimate sense, most of\r\nhuman life is tragic; because it involves a continual warfare with\r\ncircumstances, which the majority of people carry on with a silent\r\nheroism. Originally, only the glorious and spectacular conflicts of\r\ngreat personalities were deemed worthy of representation in art; but\r\nwith the growth of sympathy the range of tragic portrayal has gradually\r\nbeen extended over almost the whole of human life. The peasant in his\r\nstruggle for subsistence against a niggardly soil, or the patient woman\r\nwho loses the bloom of her youth in the unremitting effort to maintain\r\nher children, are tragic figures.\r\n\r\nSecond, it is part of the essence of tragedy that the conflict should\r\nbe recognized as necessary and its issue as inevitable. In one form\r\nor another, whether as Greek or Christian or naturalistic, fatality\r\nhas remained an abiding element in the idea of tragedy. The purpose\r\nor passion or sentiment which impels the hero to undertake and maintain\r\nthe struggle must be a part of his nature so integral that nothing\r\nelse is possible for him. \"_Ich kann nicht anders_\" is the cry\r\nof every tragic personality. And the opposition which he meets from\r\nother persons, from social forces or natural circumstances, must seem\r\nto be equally fateful--must be represented as issuing from a counter\r\ndetermination or law no less inescapable than the hero's will. Even\r\nwhen the catastrophe depends upon some so-called accident, it must be\r\nmade to appear necessary that our human purposes should sometimes be\r\ncaught and strangled in the web of natural fact which envelops them.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for our acceptance of tragedy are not difficult to find\r\nand have been noted, with more or less clearness, by all students. We\r\naccept it much as the hero accepts his own struggle--he believes in\r\nthe values which he is fighting for and we sympathetically make his\r\nwill ours. Moreover, we discover a special value in his courage which,\r\nwe feel, compensates for the evil of his suffering, defeat, or death.\r\nSo long as we set any value on life, it is impossible for us not to\r\nesteem courage; for courage is at once the defense against attack of\r\nall our possessions and the source, in personal initiative and\r\naggressive action, of newer and larger life. And any shrinking that\r\nwe may feel against the sternness of the struggle is quenched both by\r\nthe hero's example and by our recognition of its necessity. Since we\r\nare not participants of it, our protest would be futile, and even if\r\nwe played a part in it, we should be as foolish as we should be weak,\r\nnot to recognize that the will which opposes us is as inflexible as\r\nour own--\"such is life\"--that is our ultimate comment. An appreciation\r\nof tragedy involves, therefore, a sure discernment of the essential\r\ndisharmony of existence, yet at the same time, a feeling for the moral\r\nvalues which it may create; neither the optimist nor the utilitarian\r\ncan enter into its world.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, works of art in which sheer evil, without any\r\ncompensating development of character, is portrayed; where indeed the\r\nstruggle may even cause decay of character. In Zola's _The Dram\r\nShop_, for example, the story is the tale of the moral decline,\r\nthrough unfortunate circumstances and vicious surroundings, of the\r\nsweet, pliant Gervaise. Instead of developing a resistance to\r\ncircumstances which would have made them yield a value even in defeat,\r\nshe lets herself go and is spoiled beneath them. She has no friend to\r\nhelp or guardian angel to save. We do not blame her, for, with her\r\nsoft nature, she could not do otherwise than crumble under the hard\r\npress of fate; neither can we admire her, for she lacks the adamantine\r\nstuff of which heroes are made. This is pathos, not tragedy. And just\r\nas most of human life involves tragedy in so far as it develops a\r\nstrength to meet the dangers which threaten it, so likewise it involves\r\npathos, in so far as it seldom resists at every point, but gives way,\r\nblighted without hope. Many a man or woman issues from life's conflicts\r\nweaker, not stronger; broken, not defiant; petulant, not sweetened;\r\nand at the hour of death there are few heroes. Yet there may be beauty\r\nin the story of this human weakness and weariness. Whence comes it?\r\nHow can the representation of this sheer evil become a good? The\r\nprinciple involved is a simple one. Announced first, as far as I know,\r\nby Mendelssohn, it has recently been much more scientifically and\r\npenetratingly analyzed by Lipps, although wrongly applied by him to\r\nthe tragic rather than the pathetic.[Footnote: Cf. Lipps: _Der Streit\r\nber die Tragodie_, and _Aesthetik_, Bd. I, S. 599.]\r\n\r\nIt is a familiar and generally recognized experience, as Lipps has\r\nobserved, that any threat or harm done to a value evokes in us a\r\nheightened appreciation of its worth. Parting is a sweet sorrow because\r\nonly then do we fully realize the worth of what we are losing; the\r\nbeauty of youth that dies is more beautiful because in death its\r\nradiance shines the brighter in our memory. A good in contemplation\r\ncomes to take the place of a lost good in reality. Just as we hold on\r\nthe more tightly to things that are slipping away from us in a vain\r\neffort to keep them, so to save ourselves from utter sorrow, we build\r\nup in the imagination a fair image of what we have lost, free of the\r\ndust of the world. This makes the peculiar charm of the delicate and\r\nfragile, of weak things and little things, of the transient and\r\nperishable; they awaken in us the tender, protective impulse while\r\nthey last, and when they are gone they suffer at our hands an\r\nidealization which the strong and enduring can never receive. Our pity\r\nfor them mediates an increased love of them; we mock at fate which\r\ndeprives us of them by keeping them secure and fairer in our memory.\r\n\r\nAs in life, so in art. Beneath and around the pictured destruction and\r\nruin there opens up to us a more poignant vision of the loveliness of\r\nwhat was or might have been. At the end of _The Dram Shop_, when\r\nGervaise sinks into ruin, we inevitably revert to the beginning and\r\nsee again, only more intensely, the gentle girl that she was, or else,\r\ngoing forward, we imagine what she might have been, if only she had\r\nbeen given a chance. The form of a possible good rises up from under\r\nthe actual evil. The story of oppression becomes the praise of freedom;\r\nthe picture of death, a vision of life. I know of no finer example of\r\nthis in all literature than Sophocles' _Ajax_. Ajax has offended\r\nAthena, so he, the hero of the Grecian host, is seized with the mad\r\ndesire to do battle with cattle and sheep. In lucid intervals he laments\r\nto his wife the shameful fate which has befallen him. How glorious his\r\nformer prowess appears lost in so ridiculous a counterfeit! And his\r\ndespair creates its magic.\r\n\r\nIn almost all so-called tragedies, true tragedy and pathos are\r\nintermingled; for we feel both pity and admiration, and the pity\r\nintensifies the admiration. The danger that threatens or the disaster\r\nthat overwhelms the values which the hero embodies make us realize\r\ntheir worth the more. Throughout the _Antigone_ we admire the\r\nheroine's tragic courage of devotion; but it is at the point when,\r\njust before her death, she laments her youth and beauty that shall go\r\nfruitless--\r\n\r\n  Alechron, anymenaion, oute ton gamon\r\n  mepos lachousan oute paideion tpophaes\r\n\r\nthat we feel the fullness of strength that was needed for the sacrifice.\r\nOne might perhaps think this lament a blemish of weakness in a picture\r\nof fortitude; but the impression is just the opposite, I believe; for\r\nforce is measured by what it overcomes.\r\n\r\nThere are so many different theories of tragedy that it would be\r\nimpossible, were it worth while, to embark on a criticism of all of\r\nthem. There are certain ones, however, which, because of their wide\r\nacceptance, demand some attention at our hands. First, it is often\r\nassumed that a tragedy should represent the good as ultimately\r\ntriumphing, despite suffering and failure. But how can the good triumph\r\nwhen the hero fails and dies? Only, it is answered, if the hero\r\nrepresents a cause which may win despite or even because of his\r\nindividual doom; and it is with this cause, not with him, that we\r\nchiefly sympathize. This was Hegel's view, who demanded that the tragic\r\nhero represent some universal interest which, when purged of the\r\none-sidedness and uncompromising insistence of the hero's championing,\r\nmay nevertheless endure and triumph in its genuine worth. In the\r\n_Antigone_, Hegel's favorite example, the cause of family loyalty\r\nfinds recognition through the punishment of Creon for the girl's death;\r\nwhile at the same time the principle of the sovereignty of the state\r\nis upheld through her sacrifice. There are many tragedies which conform,\r\nat least partially, to this scheme; but not all, hence it cannot be\r\na universal norm. In _Romeo and Juliet_, for example, although\r\nthe death of the young people serves to bring about a reconciliation\r\nof their families, the real principle for which they suffered--the\r\nright of private choice in matters of love--is in no way furthered by\r\nthe outcome of the play. And, although it is always possible to\r\nuniversalize the good which is sought by any will, it is not possible\r\nto deflect upon a principle the full intensity of our sympathy, away\r\nfrom the individual, concrete passion and action. Whenever a great\r\npersonality is represented, it is his personal suffering and fortitude\r\nthat win at once our pity and our admiration. For private sorrows, for\r\nthe ruin of character, for the death of those whom we are made to love,\r\nthere can be no complete atonement in the universal; because it is\r\nwith the individual that we are chiefly concerned. No; the\r\nreconciliation lies where we have placed it--in tragedy, in the personal\r\nheroism of the strong character; in pathos, in the vision, not in the\r\ntriumph, of the good.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary Protestant theological theory of tragedy is even more\r\ninadequate than the Hegelian. For, by assuming that there is no genuine\r\nloss in the world, that every evil is compensated for in the future\r\nlives of the heroes, it takes away the sting from their sacrifice and\r\nso deprives them of their crown of glory. It makes every adventure a\r\ncalculation of prudence and every despair a farce. It is remote from\r\nthe reality of experience where men stake all on a chance and, instead\r\nof receiving the good by an act of grace, wring it by blood and tears\r\nfrom evil.\r\n\r\nOn much the same level of thinking is the moralistic theory which\r\nrequires that the misfortunes of the hero should be the penalty for\r\nsome fault or weakness. This view, which has the authority of Aristotle,\r\nis also based on the doctrine of the justice of the world-order. It\r\nwas pretty consistently carried out in the classical Greek drama;\r\nalthough there suffering is not exacted as an external retribution,\r\nbut as the inevitable consequence of the turbulent passions of the\r\ncharacters; for even the punishment for offenses against the gods is\r\nof the nature of a personal revenge which they take. Later, of course,\r\nwhen the gods retreated into the background of human life, retributive\r\njustice was conceived more abstractly. Now, it must be admitted, I\r\nthink, that this idea, so deeply rooted in the popular mind, has exerted\r\na profound influence on the drama; yet it cannot be applied universally\r\nwithout sophistry. To be sure, in _Romeo and Juliet_, the young\r\npeople were disobedient and headstrong; in _Lear_, the old father\r\nwas foolishly trustful of his wicked daughters; these frailties brought\r\nabout their ruin. But did they deserve so hard a fate as theirs? Did\r\nnot Lear suffer as much for his folly as his daughters for their\r\nwickedness? This is always true in life, and Shakespeare holds the\r\nmirror up to nature--but is it consistent with the theory of retributive\r\njustice? One can usually trace back to some element of his nature,\r\nphysical or moral, the misfortunes that befall an individual; even\r\nthose which we call accidents, as Galton claimed, are often due to\r\nsome inherent defect of attention which makes us fail to respond\r\nprotectively at the right moment. If we take the self to include the\r\nentire organism, then it remains true that we cooperate as a partial\r\ncause in all that happens to us. Ophelia's weak and unresisting brain\r\nmust share with the stresses which surrounded her the responsibility\r\nfor her madness. In this sense, and in this sense only, do we deserve\r\nour fate, be it good or ill. Yet, when interpreted in this broadest\r\nmeaning, retributive justice loses all ethical significance. And the\r\ncosmic disharmony appears all the more glaring. It ceases to be\r\nchargeable to an external fate or God, to the environment or convention,\r\nwhich might perhaps be mastered and remolded; and is seen pervading\r\nthe nature of reality itself, no accidental circumstance, but essential\r\nevil, ineradicable. The greatest tragic poets see it thus. And then\r\nblame turns to understanding and resentment into pity.\r\n\r\nRetributive justice, as the motive force of tragedy, has for us lost\r\nits meaning. We no longer feel the necessity of justifying the ways\r\nof God to man, because we have ceased to believe that there exists any\r\nsingle, responsible power. The good is not a preordained and\r\nautomatically accomplished fact, but an achievement of finite effort,\r\nappearing here and there in the world when individuals, instead of\r\ncontending against each other, cooperate for their mutual advantage.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the comic, there is much artistic representation of\r\nevil which can be classed neither as pathetic nor as tragic. Neither\r\nmoral admiration nor idealization are aroused by the characters\r\nportrayed. They may be great criminals like Lady Macbeth or Iago, or\r\nthe undistinguished and disorderly people of modern realistic\r\nliterature, yet in either case we find them good to know. And we do\r\nso, not merely because we enjoy, as disinterested onlookers, the\r\nspectacle of human existence, but because the artist makes us enter\r\ninto it and realize its values. For even that which from the moral\r\npoint of view we pronounce evil is, so long as it maintains itself,\r\na good thing from its own point of view. Every will, however blind and\r\ncareless, seeks a good and finds it, if only in hope and the effort\r\nto attain. Through the intimacy of his descriptions and often against\r\nour resistance, the artist may compel us to adopt the attitude of the\r\nlife which he is portraying, constraining us to feel the inner necessity\r\nof its choices, the compulsion of its delights. It is difficult to\r\nabandon ourselves thus to sympathy with what is wrong in life itself,\r\nbecause we have in mind the consequences and relations which make it\r\nwrong; yet we all do so at times, whenever we let ourselves go, charmed\r\nby its momentary offering. But in the world of art this is easier,\r\nbecause there the values, being merely represented, can have no sinister\r\neffects. When great personalities are portrayed, this abandon is\r\nreadiest; for the strength or poignancy of their natures carries us\r\naway as by a whirlwind. Witness Lady Macbeth when she summons the\r\npowers of hell to unsex her for her murderous task, or Vanni Fucci in\r\nthe _Inferno_,[Footnote: _Inferno_, Canto 25, 1-3.] who mocks\r\nat God. For the instant, we become as they and feel their ecstasy of\r\npride and power as our own. Yet the great artist can awaken this\r\nsympathy even for characters that are small and weak. In Gogol's _Dead\r\nSouls_, for example, there are no heroes. The most interesting\r\ncharacters are the country gentlemen who return to their estates\r\nplanning to write books which will regenerate Russia. But the old\r\nhabits of life in the remote district are too strong. So, instead of\r\nwriting, they fall back into the routine of their ancestors and merely\r\nsmoke and dream. Here are failure and mediocrity; yet so intimate is\r\nthe artist's story that we not only understand it all, but feel how\r\ngood it is--to dream our lives away. I do not doubt that in this story\r\nthere are elements of pathos and comedy; yet, in general, the\r\ndelineation is too objective for either; we neither laugh nor cry, but\r\nare simply borne on, unresisting, ourselves become a part of the silent\r\ntide of Russian life.\r\n\r\nThe problem of evil in aesthetics may finally be solved by the use of\r\nthe comic. For in comedy we take pleasure in an object which, in the\r\nbroadest sense, is evil. In order for an object to be comical there\r\nmust be a standard or norm, an accepted system, within which the object\r\npretends but fails to fit, and with reference to which, therefore, it\r\nis evil. There must be some points of contact between the object and\r\nthe standard in order that there may be pretense, but not enough points\r\nfor fulfillment. If we never had any definite expectations with\r\nreference to things, never made any demands upon them; if instead of\r\njudging them by our preconceived ideas, we took them just as they came\r\nand changed our ideas to meet them,--there would be nothing comical.\r\nOr, if everything fitted into our expectations and was as we planned\r\nit, then again there would be nothing comical. In a world without\r\nideas, the comic could not exist. The comic depends upon our\r\napperceiving an object in terms of some idea and finding it incongruous.\r\nThe most elementary illustrations demonstrate this. The unusual is the\r\noriginal comic; to the child all strange things are comical--the\r\nChinaman with his pigtail, the negro with his black skin, the new\r\nfashion in dress, the clown with his paint and his antics. As we get\r\nused to things, and that means as we come to form ideas of them into\r\nwhich they will fit, adjusting the mind to them, rather than seeking\r\nto adjust them to the mind, they cease to be comical. So fashions in\r\ndress or manners which were comical once, become matters of course and\r\nwe laugh no longer. Enduringly comic are only those objects that\r\npersistently create expectations and as persistently violate them.\r\nSuch objects are few indeed; but they exist, and constitute the\r\nperennial, yet never wearying, stock in trade of comedy. But the comic\r\nspirit does not have to depend upon them exclusively, for, as life\r\nchanges, it constantly raises new expectations and offers new objects\r\nwhich at once provoke and fail to meet them. Everything, therefore,\r\nis potentially comical and, in the course of human history, few things\r\ncan escape a laugh; some curious mind is sure, sooner or later, to\r\nbring them under a new idea against which they will be shown up to be\r\nabsurd. The sanctities of religion, love, and political allegiance\r\nhave not been exempt.\r\n\r\nWhy, if the comical object is always opposed to our demands, should\r\nwe take pleasure in it? How can we be reconciled to things that are\r\nadmittedly incongruous with our standards? Why are we not rather\r\ndispleased and angry with them? Investigators have usually looked for\r\na single source of pleasure in the comic, but of those which have been\r\nsuggested at least two, I think, contribute something. First, by\r\nadopting the point of view of the standard as our own, identifying\r\nourselves with it, and through the contrast of ourselves with the\r\nobject, we may take pleasure in the resulting exaltation of ourselves.\r\nThe pleasure in the comic is often closely akin to that which we feel\r\nin distinction of any kind. We feel ourselves superior to the object\r\nat which we laugh. There is pride in much of laughter and not\r\ninfrequently cruelty, a delight in the absurdities of other men because\r\nthey exalt ourselves as the representatives of the rational and normal.\r\nThere is often a touch of malice even in the laughter of the child.\r\nNevertheless, the pleasure in the comic is still contemplative, and\r\nso far aesthetic, because it is a pleasure in perception, not in action.\r\nNo matter how evil be the comic object, we do not seek to destroy or\r\nremodel it; action is sublimated into laughter.\r\n\r\nBut the pleasure in the comic may arise through our taking the opposite\r\npoint of view--that of the funny thing itself. Instead of upholding\r\nthe point of view of the standard, we may identify ourselves with the\r\nobject. If the comic spirit is oftentimes the champion of the normal\r\nand conventional, it is as often the mischief-maker and rebel. Whenever\r\nthe maintaining of a standard involves strain through the inhibition\r\nof instinctive tendencies, to relax and give way to impulse causes a\r\npleasure which centers itself upon the object that breaks the tension.\r\nThe intrusive animal that interrupts the solemn occasion, the child\r\nthat wittingly or not scoffs at our petty formalities through his naive\r\nbehavior, win our gratitude, not our scorn. They provide an opportunity\r\nfor the welcome release of nature from convention. And the greater the\r\nstrain of the tension, the greater the pleasure and the more\r\ninsignificant the object or event that will bring relief and cause\r\nlaughter. The perennial comic pleasure in the risque is derived from\r\nthis source. There is an element of comic pleasure in the perpetration\r\nof any mischievous or unconventional act. Those things which men take\r\nmost seriously, Schopenhauer has said, namely, love and religion, and\r\nwe might add, morality, are the most abundant sources of the comic,\r\nbecause they involve the most strain and therefore offer the easiest\r\nchances for a playful release. Even utter and absolute nonsense is\r\ncomical because it undoes all Kant's categories of mind.\r\n\r\nHence, contrary to the theory of Bergson, the spontaneous as well as\r\nthe mechanical and rigid may be comical. Sometimes the same object may\r\nbe comical from both the points of view which we have specified; this\r\nis always true, as we shall see, in the most highly developed comedy.\r\nFor example, we may laugh at the child's prank because it is so absurd\r\nfrom the point of view of our grown-up expectations as to reasonable\r\nconduct, and at the same time, taking the part of the child, rejoice\r\nat the momentary relief from them which it offers us. Our scorn is\r\nmixed with sympathy. And oftentimes the child himself will hold both\r\npoints of view at once, laughing at his own absurdity and exulting\r\nnevertheless in his own freedom. This is the essence of slyness. It\r\nfollows, moreover, that a thing which was comical for one of the reasons\r\nassigned may become comical for the other, by a simple change in the\r\npoint of view regarding it. For the behavior which first pleased us\r\nbecause it was unconventional tends itself to become a new convention,\r\nwith reference to which the old convention then becomes the object of\r\na laughter which is scornful. The tables are turned: the rebel laughs\r\nat the king.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing explanation of why we find the comical pleasant also\r\nexplains why so many of our other pleasures are intermixed with the\r\ncomical--why so often we not only smile when we are pleased, but laugh.\r\nFor, in the case of all except the most elementary enjoyments, our\r\npleasures are connected with the satisfaction of definite expectations\r\nregarding the actions or events of our daily lives. But, owing to the\r\ndulling effect of habit, the pleasure attendant upon these satisfactions\r\ngradually becomes smaller and smaller or even negligible; until, as\r\na result, only the novel and surprising events which surpass our\r\nexpectations give us large pleasure; but these are comical. With the\r\nchild, whose expectations are rigid and few in number because of his\r\nlack of discrimination and small experience, almost all pleasures,\r\nlike almost all events, are of the nature of surprises. The child\r\nalmost always laughs when he is pleased. The slang phrase \"to be highly\r\ntickled\" expresses with precision this close connection between laughter\r\nand pleasure. Moreover, as the complexity of life increases, its strains\r\nand repressions are multiplied, with the result that any giving way\r\nto an impulse contains a slight element of the mischievous or\r\nridiculous; whence, for this reason too, the pleasant is also the\r\ncomical. In fact, most of the pleasures of highly complex and reflective\r\npersons are tinged with laughter.\r\n\r\nWe expect art to accomplish three great results--reconciliation,\r\nrevelation, and sympathy. So far we have shown how comic art may\r\naccomplish the first; we have yet to prove how it may accomplish the\r\nrest. In his book _Le Rire_, Bergson has expressed the view that\r\ncomedy is explicitly falsifying and unsympathetic. As to the former\r\ncharge, we can, I think, convince ourselves of the opposite if we\r\nexamine certain of the more obvious methods of comedy, particularly\r\nthose which might seem at first sight to lend support to his contention.\r\nOne of the most common of these is exaggeration. The simplest example\r\nis caricature, where certain features of an object are purposely\r\nexaggerated. The effect is, of course, comical, because we expect the\r\nnormal and duly-proportioned. What a manifest falsification, one might\r\nassert! Yet just the opposite is the actual result. For every good\r\ncaricaturist selects for exaggeration prominent and characteristic\r\ntraits, through which by the very emphasis that is placed upon them,\r\nthe nature of the individual is better understood. Another favorite\r\nmethod is abstraction. Certain traits are presented as if they were\r\nthe whole man. We get the typical comic figures of the novel and drama;\r\nthe physician who is only a physician; the lawyer who injects the legal\r\npoint of view into every circumstance of life; the lover or the miser\r\nwho is just love or greed; the people who, as in Dickens, meet every\r\nsituation with the same phrase or attitude, This, too, looks like a\r\nplain falsification of human nature, because, however strong be the\r\nprofessional bias or however overmastering the ruling passion, real\r\npeople are always more complex and many-sided, having other modifying\r\nand counteracting elements of character which prevent their speech and\r\nactions from being completely monotonous and mechanical. Nevertheless,\r\nwe can again acquit the comic writer of falsification, because we\r\nunderstand the method which he is employing, the trick of his trade.\r\nHe deceives no one. On the contrary, he enables us to perceive the\r\nlogic of certain elementary springs of character. Following the method\r\nof the experimentalist, he selects certain aspects from the total\r\ncomplexity of a phenomenon and shows how they work when isolated from\r\nthe rest. And, like the man of science, he provides insight into the\r\nnormal, because we can accept his results as at least partially or\r\napproximately true. Art of this kind is abstract and therefore less\r\nvaluable than the portrayal of the concrete; yet only the dogmatist\r\nwho insists on the restriction of art to the individual can reject it.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a third common method of comical representation\r\nwhich neither exaggerates nor abstracts, but preserves the concreteness\r\nof the finest art--we may call it the method of contrast. It consists\r\nin exhibiting the contrast between the actual conduct of men and women\r\nand the standard,--either that which they themselves profess to live\r\nup to or our own, which we impose upon them. Their pretenses are\r\nunmasked or their absurdities shown up against the ideal of\r\nreasonableness. We behold the _bourgeois_ who would be a gentleman\r\nremain _bourgeois_ and the women who would be scholars remain\r\nwomen. Success in comedy of this kind depends upon possessing the\r\nability to formulate the implicit assumptions underlying the behavior\r\nof the people portrayed or to make one's own standards with reference\r\nto them valid for the spectator. Here is no falsification, but, on the\r\ncontrary, a vivid revelation of the truth; because, just as by placing\r\ntwo colors in contrast with one another the hue of each is intensified,\r\nso by setting man in relief against the background of what he ought\r\nto be, we perceive his real nature more sharply. As the child dressed\r\nlike a grown-up appears all the more childish for his garb, so man\r\nappears the more human for his pretenses. To be sure, in order to\r\nincrease the comical effect, this method is often employed in\r\nconjunction with that of exaggeration. The Athenian democracy was\r\nprobably not quite so stupid as Aristophanes represents it; the average\r\nBritisher is not so philistine as Shaw paints him. Yet the measure of\r\nexaggeration may be small and we readily discount it. And finally,\r\nwhereas in simple representation there is a revelation of the object\r\nonly, in comical representation there is a two-fold revelation,--of\r\nthe ideal and of the incongruous reality. The former is always\r\nindirectly revealed; for, as we know, the very existence of the comic\r\ndepends upon it. The man who laughs, his notion of the right and the\r\nreasonable, his attitude towards the world and life, become manifest\r\nthrough the things which he laughs at. Only a man of a certain kind,\r\nwith a certain sympathy and antipathy, could laugh as he laughs. The\r\ncomic writer, however much of a scoffer and a skeptic, and however\r\nmuch he may deny it, is always an idealist. And it is for the revelation\r\nof themselves as much as for the revelation of the people whom they\r\nportray that we value the work of a Swift, a Voltaire, or a Thackeray.\r\n\r\nAnother charge which has been brought against the comic is that it is\r\nunsympathetic. Its attitude, it is said, is one of externality, opposed\r\ntherefore to the intimacy necessary for the complete aesthetic reaction.\r\nWhereas simple aesthetic representation places us within the object\r\nitself, comical representation only exhibits a relation between it and\r\nan idea. We judge it from our point of view, not from its own. The\r\npleasure in pride and superiority which we feel towards the comical\r\nobject seems also inconsistent with sympathy; for sympathy would create\r\na fellow feeling with it, and place us not above, but on a level with\r\nit. If we do sympathize, the comic object ceases to be comical and\r\nbecomes pathetic. We can find the follies and sins of men comical just\r\nso long as we do not sympathize with the sufferings which they entail.\r\nThere is nothing comical that may not also become pathetic; and the\r\ndifference depends exactly on the presence or absence of sympathy.\r\nNothing, for example, is more pathetic than death; yet if you keep\r\nyourself free of its sorrow, there is nothing more comical--that man,\r\na little lower in his own estimation than the angels, should come to\r\nthis, a lump of clay.\r\n\r\nIt is unquestionably true that a free, disinterested attitude is\r\nessential to comedy. You must not let yourself be carried away by any\r\nfeeling; if you are over-serious you cannot laugh; you must keep to\r\nreflection and comparison. Yet this attitude is not utterly destructive\r\nof all feeling. Man is complex enough at once to feel and to reflect.\r\nHe can pity as well as laugh. The pathetic and the comic are constantly\r\nconjoined--witness our feeling towards Don Quixote or towards any of\r\nthe great characters of Thackeray--we do not know whether to laugh or\r\nto cry. And in the most effective comedy, the standard applied to the\r\ncomical object is not foreign, but rather, as we have observed, the\r\nimplicit standard of the object itself, discernible only by the most\r\nintimate acquaintance with it. The sting of laughter comes from our\r\nacceptance of it as valid for ourselves; we blush and join in the laugh\r\nat ourselves. The mischievous-comic, moreover, depends directly upon\r\nsympathy; for it requires that we take the point of view of the funny\r\nthing; our pleasure in it implies a secret sympathy for it--we hold\r\nit up to a standard, yet all the time are in sympathy with its\r\nrebellion. When we laugh at the prank of the child, love is mixed with\r\nthe laugh. The dual nature of man as at once a partisan of convention\r\nand of the impulses that it seeks to regulate, is nowhere better\r\nillustrated than in the comic. Finally, disinterestedness is not\r\npeculiar to comedy; for it pervades all art. Feeling must be dominated\r\nby reflection; even pathos demands this, for, if we lose ourselves in\r\nsorrowful feeling, no fair image can arise and steady us.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, much comedy that is obviously unsympathetic, even\r\nhostile. There is satire, which condemns, as well as humor which\r\npardons. The one blames the unexpected and unconventional, the other\r\nsympathizes with it. Comedy is either biting or kindly. The one is\r\nmoralistic and reformatory in its aim, the other is aesthetic and\r\ncontemplative. Because of its failure in sympathy, satirical comedy\r\nis incomplete as art. It provides insight and pleasure in the object,\r\nbut no union with it. It does not attain to beauty, which is free and\r\nreconciling. Kindly comedy or humor, on the other hand, is full beauty,\r\ncombining sympathy with judgment, abandon with reflection. Nevertheless,\r\nsatire tends inevitably towards humor. For what we laugh at gives us\r\npleasure, and what pleases us we must inevitably come to like, and\r\nwhat we like cannot long fail to win our sympathy. I do not think that\r\neven a Swift or a Voltaire could have been irreconcilably opposed to\r\na world which offered them so much merriment. The satire, which begins\r\nin moral fervor, must end in understanding. The bond that binds us to\r\nour fellows is too strong to be broken by the aloofness of our\r\ncondemnation. The same intelligence that discerns the incongruity\r\nbetween what men ought to be and what they are, cannot fail to penetrate\r\nthe impelling reasons for the failure. Only in humor is sympathetic\r\ninsight complete. Satire has the temporal usefulness of a practical\r\nexpedient, humor the eternal value of beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE STANDARD OF TASTE\r\n\r\n\r\nOur interest in art is seldom a matter of mere feeling or appreciation;\r\nusually it is a matter of judgment as well. Beginning in feeling, the\r\nsthetic experience passes over into comparison and estimation--into\r\ncriticism, and there finds its normal completion. This, which is\r\nevidently true of the aesthetic life of artists and connoisseurs, is\r\ntrue also of average men. We all enjoy the beautiful in silence, but\r\nafterwards we want to talk about it to our friends. If conversation\r\nabout art were suppressed, the interest in it would hardly survive.\r\nOn this side, the enjoyment of art is intensely sociable, for to the\r\ncivilized man sociability means discourse.\r\n\r\nBut, as Kant pointed out, it is characteristic of conversation about\r\nart that the participants try to reach agreement in their judgments\r\nwithout acknowledging common principles with reference to which disputes\r\ncan be decided. And yet, since no man is content to hold an opinion\r\nall by himself, but each tries to persuade the others of the validity\r\nof his own judgment, it would seem as if there must be some axioms or\r\npostulates admitted by all. Hence what Kant called the antinomy of\r\ntaste: Thesis--the judgment of taste is not based on principles, for\r\notherwise we would determine it by proofs; antithesis--the judgment\r\nof taste is based on principles, for otherwise, despite our\r\ndisagreements, we should not be quarreling about it.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this situation, two opposed theories of criticism\r\nhave always existed. On the one hand, in face of the apparent\r\nlawlessness of beauty, some thinkers have believed that there exist\r\nprinciples which can be applied to works of art to test their beauty\r\nwith a certainty equal to that of the principles of logic in their\r\napplication to inferences. Lessing, for example, in the _Hamburgische\r\nDramaturgic_ wrote that the laws laid down by Aristotle in the\r\n_Poetics_ were as certain in their application to the drama as\r\nEuclid's _Elements_ in geometry. This comparison is a forcible\r\nstatement of belief in the existence of aesthetic standards, held by\r\nthe entire classical tradition, and still held by those who are\r\nspiritually akin to it, although of course no one to-day would\r\nclaim--and when it came to details Lessing himself did not claim--that\r\nthe judgment of Aristotle or of any one else is infallible. To-day\r\nthose who believe in the possibility of rational aesthetic criticism\r\nthink that reflection upon the purpose and methods of the arts results\r\nin the formulation of broad principles by means of which judgments of\r\ntaste can be appraised and a community of taste achieved. These\r\nprinciples, they would admit, are more difficult of application than\r\nthe simpler logical rules, owing to the greater subtlety and complexity\r\nof art, yet, when found, have an equal validity within their own field.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the view that \"there is no disputing about tastes\"\r\nhas never lacked adherents. According to this view, criticism can be\r\nonly a report of personal, enthusiastic appreciation or repugnance\r\nwithout claim to universality. Anatole France, surely a master of such\r\ncriticism, has expressed this conviction as follows: \"L'estetique ne\r\nrepose sur rien de solide. C'est un chateau en Pair. On veut l'appuyer\r\nsur Pethique. Mais il n'y a pas d'ethique. Il n'y a pas de sociologie\"\r\n... And again, in the same preface to _La Vie Litteraire:_ \"Pour\r\nfonder la critique, on parle de tradition et de consentement universel.\r\nIl n'y en a pas. L'opinion presque general, il est vrai, favorise\r\ncertains oeuvres. Mais c'est en vertu d'un prejuge, et nullement par\r\nchoix et par effet d'une preference spontane. Les oeuvres que tout le\r\nmonde admire sont celles que personne n'examine.\" Although the classic\r\nview is, I think, nearer the truth, let us examine the arguments that\r\nmay be advanced in favor of the impressionistic theory, as it has been\r\ncalled. What is there about aesthetic appreciation that makes it\r\nseemingly so recalcitrant to law?\r\n\r\nFirst, every aesthetic experience is unique, and therefore, it is\r\nclaimed, incomparable. Art is the expression of personality, and\r\npersonality is always individual. But unique things are, in the end,\r\nincapable of classification, hence are not amenable to general laws\r\nor principles. Of course, works of art can be classified by following\r\nsome abstract characteristic, arranged in a series according as this\r\nquality is realized in them to a greater or less degree; but, in so\r\nfar as a work is beautiful, it contains at least one quality not\r\npossessed by other works, the quality that gives it its distinctive\r\nflavor,--which is, indeed, its beauty. The impressionist would admit,\r\nfor example, that in intellectual power Keats's _Eve of St. Agnes_\r\nis inferior to Wordsworth's _Intimations_; also that it lacks the\r\nmoral grandeur of the latter; but would claim, on the other hand, that\r\nin saying this, one is far from judging the beauty of Keats's poem,\r\nbecause that is completely lacking in Wordsworth. So far as the poem\r\nis beautiful, it is unique; hence you get no farther with it through\r\ncomparison with some other poem. You either appreciate it absolutely\r\nor you do not; if you do, well and good; you may then write a prose\r\npoem about it, if you desire, and so communicate some of your feeling\r\nfor it to another person; if you do not appreciate it, no one can blame\r\nyou or quarrel with you; all that any one can do is to invite you to\r\nread again, and, perhaps through his eloquence, seek to inspire you\r\nwith--his own enthusiasm. Every work of art is superlative. Just as\r\nthe lover thinks his sweetheart the most beautiful woman in the world,\r\nso he who appreciates a work of art finds it supreme. And among\r\nsuperlatives there is no comparison, no better or worse.\r\n\r\nFrom another point of view, moreover, the aesthetic experience seems\r\nunfavorable to comparison and classification. For a work of art demands\r\na complete abandon of self, an entire absorption in it of attention\r\nand emotion. Every picture has a frame, and every other work of art\r\nan ideal boundary to keep you in its world. Beyond the frame you shall\r\nnot go; beyond the stage you shall not pass; beyond the outline of the\r\nstatue you shall not look. And if you do pass beyond, you have lost\r\nthe full intensity and flower of the experience; and whatever\r\ncomparisons you then make will not concern its original and genuine\r\nbeauty. Every work of art is jealous; to appreciate it aright, you\r\nmust for the moment appreciate it singly, without thought of another.\r\nFinally, the impressionist or skeptic would maintain that an alleged\r\naesthetic principle would necessarily be abstracted from extant works\r\nof art; hence could not be applied to new art. A thing which does not\r\nbelong within a class cannot be judged by principles governing that\r\nclass. In so far, therefore, as a work of art is original, it must\r\nfrustrate any attempt to judge it by traditional, historical\r\nstandards--and what other standards are there?\r\n\r\nAlthough the two facts of the aesthetic experience--its uniqueness and\r\nclaim to complete sympathy--upon which the skeptical opinion can be\r\nbased, are undoubted, the inferences deduced from them do not follow.\r\nIf they did follow, the aesthetic experience would be fundamentally\r\ndifferent from every other type; it would be totally atomic and\r\ndiscrete, instead of fluid and continuous like the rest. But its\r\napparent discreteness is due to a failure to distinguish between the\r\nsilent, unobtrusive working of comparison and the more obvious and\r\nself-conscious working. When rapt in the contemplation of a work of\r\nart, I may seemingly have no thought for other works; relative isolation\r\nand circle-like self-completeness are characteristic of the aesthetic\r\nexperience; yet, as a matter of fact, the completeness of my reaction\r\nand the measure of my delight and absorption are partly determined by\r\nthe accordance of the given work of art with a certain expectation or\r\nset of mind with reference to objects of its sort. I can consent fully\r\nto the will of the artist only if he has first consented to my will\r\nas expressed in other works which I have enjoyed and praised. The\r\nsituation in aesthetics is no different from that which exists in any\r\nother field of values; through many experiences of good things I come\r\nto form a type or standard of what such things should be like; and,\r\nif any new thing of the kind is presented to me, I cannot be so well\r\npleased with it if it does not conform. The type may never be formulated\r\nby me explicitly, yet it will operate none the less. The formation of\r\nwhat is called good taste occurs by exactly this process. The first\r\nwork of art that I see, if it please me, becomes my first measure. If\r\nI see a second, in order to win my approval, it will either have to\r\nsatisfy the expectation aroused by the first, or else surpass it. In\r\nthe latter case, a standard somewhat different from the old is created\r\nthrough the new experience; and, when I have acquired a large\r\nacquaintance with works of art, there grows up a standard which is the\r\nresultant of all of them--a type or schema no longer associated with\r\nparticular works. Sometimes, however, it happens that the standard\r\ncontinues to be embodied in some one or few works which, because of\r\noutstanding excellence, serve as explicit paradigms governing judgment;\r\nsuch works are classics in the true sense. And the impressionist is\r\ncertainly wrong in his contention that the aesthetic appreciation of\r\na work of art excludes the recall of other works and conscious\r\ncomparison with them. It is only when appreciation is of the more naive\r\nsort that this is the case. The trained observer, on seeing one of\r\nVermeer's pictures, for example, cannot fail to think of other works\r\nof the same artist; and, if he is learned in the history of art, he\r\nmay even recall the whole development of Dutch painting. For the moment,\r\nperhaps, at the beginning, the single work will completely absorb the\r\nattention; but, as we linger in appreciation and reflect upon it, our\r\nmemory is sure to work. And the process of memory and comparison cannot\r\nbe excluded on the ground that it is an external, irrelevant context\r\nto appreciation; for it actually functions to determine the degree of\r\npleasure and absorption in a work of art. Moreover, this process of\r\nmemory and comparison is not confined to the individual observer; it\r\nis social and historical as well. All art movements are inspired by\r\nthe desire to improve on, or to create something different from, the\r\nconserved tradition. The process of creation itself involves comparison\r\nand the recognition of a standard. And for our civilization at any\r\nrate these movements are international. They are not the products of\r\nisolated discrete groups, impenetrable to each other, but of a\r\nrelatively universal, continuous experience.\r\n\r\nAs for the uniqueness of aesthetic value, that, to be sure, is a fact;\r\nyet uniqueness is never the whole of any object. Those aspects which\r\nally it with other things are just as genuinely its own as those which\r\ndifferentiate it from them; they equally are a part of its beauty. The\r\nattempt to separate any part of a work of art from the rest as \"the\r\nreal part\" is an unwarranted and arbitrary dismemberment. The work is\r\nwhole, and beauty belongs to it as whole. Hence, when, through\r\ncomparison, you attend to the qualities that are shared with other\r\nworks, you are still judging the reality and beauty of the object,\r\nquite as much as when you seek to taste its unique flavor. A competent\r\njudgment can neglect no aspect. The judgment that a work of art is\r\nbetter or worse than another in some general aspect touches it just\r\nas surely as the feeling for its distinctiveness. And if it be true\r\nthat so far as things are unique they are all on a level, it is equally\r\ntrue that so far as they are not unique they are capable of being\r\nserialized, and our total judgment upon them must follow the lines of\r\ncomparison.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, therefore, not to compare works of art one with\r\nanother. We will concede to the impressionist that anything which\r\nanybody finds beautiful is beautiful momentarily; but we must insist\r\non the everyday fact that, because of the operation of the standard\r\nas a result of growing experience in art, what once seemed beautiful\r\noften ceases to seem so. And we must also insist that among the things\r\nsurviving as beautiful we inevitably set up a hierarchy, a scale. A\r\nplurality of values, each unique and in its own way indispensable to\r\na complete world of values, is not inconsistent with relations of\r\nhigher and lower among them. The impressionist has taught us to love\r\nvariety and to renounce the bigotry of the old refusal to accept\r\nanything short of the highest. But in aesthetics--and in ethics too,\r\nI believe--the standpoint of Spinoza rules: \"God is revealed in the\r\nmouse as well as in the angel, although less in the mouse than in the\r\nangel;\" and, I should add, the revelation through the humbler mouse\r\nis necessary to a complete revelation of God, that is, of the Good.\r\nOr, as Nietzsche said, \"_Vieler Edlern naemlich bedarf es, dass es\r\nAdel gebe!_\" Our appreciation of _Midsummer Night's Dream_ does not\r\nprevent us from appreciating _Alice in Wonderland,_ just as our esteem\r\nfor the man does not hinder our feeling for the peculiar charm of the\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nWhat takes place through the process of comparison is this: we come\r\nincreasingly to realize what we want of art. Every artist seeks to\r\nexpress something in terms of the material with which he works. But\r\nit is only by experimenting with his medium that he learns what he can\r\nand what he cannot do; and it is only by constant hospitable, yet\r\ndiscriminating appreciation by us spectators that we, in our turn,\r\ndiscover what to demand of him and commend. Consider, for example, the\r\nhistory of painting. That we want of a picture, sometimes the\r\ndelineation of emotion and action, yes; but above all and always, the\r\nrepresentation of visible nature, with space and atmosphere and\r\nlight--this purpose has been developed slowly and as the result of\r\nmany experiments and comparisons. But having won it, we are secure in\r\nit. We shall still appreciate the beauty of the primitives and\r\nacademics, but we shall not be able again to prefer them to the\r\n_plein-airistes_. Or recall the development of English poetry.\r\nWe still admit the contribution of Dryden and Pope, but we shall never\r\nhave to fight over again the battle won by Wordsworth and his\r\ncontemporaries for imagination and emotion. Our conception of the\r\npurpose of poetry has been enriched by an insight that we cannot\r\npermanently lose. There are, to be sure, retrograde movements in the\r\narts--like the Pre-Raphaelite movement in painting--but they are soon\r\nrecognized as such.\r\n\r\nNow with reference to the purpose of art to express in a given material,\r\nthere are, I think, a few general principles of judgment applying to\r\nall the arts, implicitly or explicitly recognized in criticism, and\r\ncapable of formulation. First, the complete use of the medium. We\r\nprefer, other things being equal, the work of art that has fully\r\nexploited the expressive possibilities of its medium to one that has\r\nfailed to do so. As an illustration, I would cite the almost universal\r\ncondemnation, at the present time, of neo-classical sculpture, in which\r\nthe touch values of the surfaces of statues were destroyed. Of course\r\nsome compensating gain may be claimed--a greater visual purity; yet,\r\nas we shall see, from the point of view of expression, the gain was\r\nnegligible compared with the loss. So likewise, unless the\r\n_vers-libristes_ can show some positive gain in expression,--a\r\npower to do something that normal verse cannot do, their work must\r\nrank lower than normal verse, which makes fuller use of the rhythmic\r\npossibilities of language.\r\n\r\nSecond, the unique use of the material. What we want of art depends,\r\nnot only on comparison between works of art belonging to the same\r\ngenre, but on comparison of the purposes of different genres, indeed\r\nof the different arts themselves. What we want of painting depends\r\nupon what we want of sculpture; what we want of poetry depends upon\r\nwhat we want of painting and music. We compare picture with picture;\r\nbut equally we compare picture with statue and poem. We do not want\r\nthe sculptor to try to do what the painter can do better, and\r\nvice-versa; or the poet to encroach on the domains proper to the\r\nmusician and painter. We do not want poetry to be merely imagistic or\r\nmerely musical when we have another art that can give us much better\r\npictures and still another that can give us much better music than any\r\nword-painting or word-music. When we read a poem, we do not want to\r\nbe made to think how much better the same thing could be done in a\r\ndifferent medium. There is nothing so salutary in keeping an art to\r\nits proper task as a flourishing condition of the other arts. Here the\r\ngreat example is France, where the limitations of the different arts\r\nhave been best recognized all the while the highest level of perfection\r\nhas been reached in many arts contemporaneously.\r\n\r\nThird, the perfect use of the medium in the effort to fulfill the\r\nartistic purpose of sympathetic representation--the power to delight\r\nthe senses and create sympathy for the object expressed, on the one\r\nhand, and the range of the vision of the object, on the other; the\r\ndepth and the breadth of the aesthetic experience. With reference to\r\nthe former we ask: how vividly does the work of art force us to see;\r\nhow completely does it make us enter into the world it has created;\r\nand, in doing this, how poignantly has it charmed us, how close has\r\nit united us to itself? The measure of this is partly subjective and\r\nirreducible to rules; yet experience in the arts establishes a norm\r\nor schema of appreciation through the process of comparison, largely\r\nunconscious, by which what we call good taste is acquired. There are\r\ncertain works of art that seem to have fulfilled this requirement in\r\nthe highest possible degree, thus attaining to perfection within their\r\ncompass. Such, for example, are some of Sappho's or Goethe's lyrics,\r\nor the Fifth Canto of the _Inferno_. Nothing more perfect, more\r\nbeautiful of their kind can be conceived. And to see how works of art\r\nmay differ in degree of perfection of sympathetic vision, one has only\r\nto recall lesser works expressing the same themes. Yet we recognize\r\ngreater works even than those cited--works in which, although the\r\nsympathetic vision is no more penetrating and compelling, it is broader,\r\nmore inclusive. Goethe's _Faust_ is greater than any of his lyrics\r\nbecause the range of experience which it expresses is vaster. A\r\nVelasquez is greater than a Peter De Hooch because, in addition to an\r\nequal beauty of expression through color and line and composition, an\r\nequal dominion over light and space, it contains a marvelous revelation\r\nof the inner life, which is absent from the latter. According to\r\nBerenson, no one has yet painted the perfect landscape because thus\r\nfar only a certain few aspects have been expressed, but not all.\r\n\r\nThere are, I think, certain qualities which are generally recognized\r\nas necessary to the perfect fulfillment of the artistic purpose of a\r\nwork; which follow, indeed, from the very meaning of art. Thus, without\r\nuniqueness and freshness there can be no perfection in artistic\r\nexpression. A well-worn or even an identical expression may have value\r\nin the solution of a practical problem, or in bringing men into\r\ngood-natured relationships with one another in social life; as when,\r\nfor example, the officer cries \"Halt!\" repeatedly, or we say \"Good\r\nmorning\" at breakfast; because, in such cases, the expression gets its\r\nsignificance from the context in which it belongs. But in art, where\r\nexpression is freed from the particular setting within which it arises,\r\nthus attaining universality, the repetitious and imitative, having no\r\nenvironment from which they may derive new meaning, are purposeless.\r\nThey are, indeed, worse than negligible, because having grown into the\r\nhabit of expecting originality, we are disappointed and bored when we\r\nfail to find it. Originality is, of course, relative; it is not\r\nincompatible with the reminiscence of old works--what works of art are\r\nnot reminiscent?--but it does prohibit saying the old things over again\r\nin the same medium; the artist must have a new message to put into the\r\nmedium; or else, if the old themes are still near to his heart, he\r\nmust invent a new form in which to express them, from which they will\r\nderive a new music. Closely allied to freshness are spontaneity and\r\ninner necessity, the signs of a genuine, as opposed to a factitious,\r\nexpression. If we get the impression from a work of art that no part\r\ncould be otherwise--not a single line or note or stroke of the\r\nbrush--then we have the same sort of feeling towards it that we have\r\ntowards the living thing that was not made by hands capriciously, but\r\ngrew in its inevitable way in accordance with the laws of its own\r\nnature. Of course, works of art are products of thought, of plan, and\r\nconscious purpose; they are seldom composed all at one flash, but grow\r\ntentatively into their final form; nevertheless, in the words of Kant,\r\n\"A work of art must look like nature, albeit we know that it is art.\"\r\nSense charm and order are also necessary; for they are the conditions\r\nof a perfect sympathy and vision. We are indulgent towards the vigorous,\r\nimpatient passion that bubbles over into rough and careless music or\r\npoetry, but are not satisfied with it. For art's task is not merely\r\nto express, but to dominate through expression, to create out of\r\nexpression, beauty; and without order and charm of sense, there is no\r\nbeauty. Compose your passion, we say to the musician; pattern it forth,\r\nwe say to the poet; it will not lose its vigor; rather it will acquire\r\na new power; for thus it will achieve restraint, the sign of art's\r\ndominion.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of the principles indicated presupposes, of course,\r\nthat art really has a purpose with reference to which it can be judged\r\nas successful or unsuccessful. But I do not see how this can very well\r\nbe denied. Art is one of the oldest of human activities, one might\r\nalmost say institutions, and it is inconceivable that it should not\r\nhave been directed by some intention, conscious or unconscious. To be\r\nsure, men have expressed this intention in varying, often in\r\ninconsistent ways, but the same is true of all other human activities\r\nand institutions. Few would deny, I suppose, that science and the state\r\nhave purposes; yet how various have been the definitions of them. These\r\nvariations have corresponded, without doubt, to adaptations to new\r\nconditions, yet throughout some unique purpose in human life has been\r\nsubserved. So with art. Art has been identified now with one interest\r\nand now with another; what people want of art differs from one age to\r\nanother, and each must define that for itself; yet throughout there\r\nhas been a core of identity in the purposes it has served. In our own\r\nage we witness the attempt to distinguish the purpose of art from the\r\npurposes of other elements of civilization, with which it has often\r\nbeen fused and confused,--science, religion, morality. Correspondingly\r\nwe witness the effort to limit the functions of political control; to\r\ntake from its jurisdiction religion, culture, love. And this effort\r\nis for the sake of a fuller and freer realization of values.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, not only has art a general function, but this function\r\nis differentiated among the different art forms and genres. No work\r\nof art can be judged without reference to its function. Its beauty\r\nconsists in the fulfillment of this function. Now this function is,\r\nof course, largely unique for each art form and for each particular\r\nwork of art, and every work has to be judged with reference to its\r\nindividual purpose, yet a knowledge of other works of the same artist\r\nand the same genre, and of the general history of art, helps to divine\r\nthis purpose and to judge of its relative success. There is a large\r\nmeasure of continuity in the intentions of a given artist and school\r\nof art. The development of painting in the last century is a striking\r\nillustration of such continuity. The painters sought to develop a\r\ndefinite tradition, thinking of themselves as carrying further the\r\nwork of their predecessors. Of course these developments were largely\r\ntechnical in character, but beauty itself is the fruition of technique.\r\n\r\nThe people who base a skeptical opinion upon the historical changes\r\nin taste forget that taste is necessarily a growth; that it is developed\r\nby trial and error, through and despite the following of many false\r\npaths. Only if the standard were something delivered to men by divine\r\nrevelation--as indeed the old dogmatists came very close to believing--\r\nwould it be strange and inconsistent for changes to occur. But if, as\r\nis the fact, the standard is experimental and representative of actual\r\nartistic purposes, then change is normal. Moreover, the standard is\r\nnot single and absolute, but plural and relative. Growth in taste means\r\nnot only development along a given line, within a given form, but\r\nenlargement through the origination of new forms and beauties. It is\r\nnot like the straight line growth of an animal, but rather radial,\r\nlike the growth of a plant, sending out branches in every direction.\r\nAn art may attain to perfection in a certain genre, and then continue\r\nonly through the creation of new types. Thus sculpture and architecture\r\nreached a kind of perfection in the classic, beyond which it was\r\nimpossible to go--the only possible development lay in the creation\r\nof new types.\r\n\r\nIf it is true, then, that the existence of standards has a sound basis\r\nin the aesthetic experience, how can their apparent failure to work and\r\nsecure unanimity of judgment be explained? How account for the actual\r\nchaos of judgment? Partly, at least, because many judgments passed on\r\nworks of art are not aesthetic judgments at all. These must be eliminated\r\nif any consensus is to be won. We may call these judgments \"pseudo-\r\nsthetic\" judgments. They fall naturally into several classes, which\r\nit will be worth while to describe.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is the very large class of partisan judgments--judgments\r\nbased, not upon a free appreciation, but upon some personal predilection\r\nor transient appeal. To this class belong the special preferences of\r\nboyhood and youth--the liking for Cooper and Jules Verne, for example--\r\nand those due to nationality, like the Englishman's choice of Thackeray\r\nand the Frenchman's of Balzac, or, what is a more flagrant case, the\r\nlong resistance of the French public to the beauty of Wagner's music.\r\nThe former type of judgment is corrected by the simple process of\r\nmaturing, when the beauties appreciated in youth are not lost, but\r\nonly given their due place in the hierarchy of aesthetic values; the\r\nlatter type, on the other hand, being more deeply based, is more\r\ndifficult to remedy. But that even this prejudice can be largely\r\novercome is shown by the example of critics who, through prolonged\r\nsympathetic study, come to prefer the art of a foreign land. A notable\r\nexample of this is Meier-Graeffe, who condemns almost all of modern\r\nGerman painting and exalts the French. [Footnote: See his _Modern\r\nArt_, and his special studies of Manet, Renoir, and Degas.] Patriotic\r\npreferences are so difficult to overcome because they spring from\r\nlimitations of sympathy. Sympathy depends upon acquaintance, and few\r\nof us can acquire the same expertness in an alien language or artistic\r\nform that we possess in our own. Yet, understanding the reason for\r\nthese deficiencies of judgment, we can go to work to improve them,\r\nthrough increasing our knowledge of foreign art.\r\n\r\nNo less inevitable psychologically is the preference for works of art\r\nthat treat of the problems and conditions of contemporary life. Part\r\nof this, to be sure, is expressive merely of some transient mood of\r\nthe popular mind. The enthusiasm, happily passing, for the plays of\r\nBrieux or the craze for Algerian landscapes in France after the\r\nacquirement of the colony, are examples. Such preferences, being\r\nsuperficially motivated, correct themselves with ease, giving way to\r\nsome new fashion in taste. The preference for works of art that reflect\r\nthe more serious and permanent problems of contemporary society is\r\nmore firmly rooted. Men inevitably seek the artistic expression of the\r\nthings that deeply concern them. The problems of the reconstruction\r\nof the family, of the working classes, and of government must continue\r\nto inspire art and to determine our interest in it, until new\r\ndifficulties occupy our minds. The mere passage of time, however,\r\nbrings a remedy for critical injustices flowing from this source; for,\r\nwhen present problems are solved, the difference between living art,\r\nwhich expresses them, and historical art, vanishes. Then, only those\r\nworks which reflect the eternal enigmas have any advantage over the\r\nothers. The same process tends to eliminate the prejudice, rooted in\r\ntemperament, in favor of the old and familiar in art; or, following\r\na different bent, in favor of the new and startling. In such cases,\r\na just estimate can be made only when the new becomes the old, and\r\nboth are reduced to a common level.\r\n\r\nAnother type of pseudo-aesthetic judgment is the imitative. By this I\r\nmean the judgment which is made because somebody else has made it,\r\nparticularly somebody in authority. The imitative judgment is the\r\nexpression, in the field of aesthetics, of what Trotter has called \"herd\r\ninstinct,\" [Footnote: See his _The Herd Instinct in Peace and War_,\r\nfirst part.] the tendency on the part of the gregarious animal to make\r\nhis acts and habits conform to those of another member of the same\r\ngroup, particularly if that member is a leader or represents the\r\nmajority. The dislike of loneliness and the love of companionship\r\noperate, as we have already had occasion to notice, even in the sphere\r\nof the spirit. Differences here separate people just as other\r\ndifferences do. In art, herd instinct tends to make the judgment of\r\nthe authoritative or fashionable critic take the place of spontaneous\r\nand sincere judgment. I do not mean that such judgments are usually\r\nconsciously insincere; although they often are so, since men seek to\r\ningratiate themselves by flattering even the aesthetic opinions of those\r\nwhose love or protection they desire. I do mean, however, that they\r\ntend to suppress opinions which would reflect an autonomous\r\nappreciation. Moreover, whatever may be said for herd-instinct in the\r\nrealm of politics and morals, where the need for common action makes\r\nnecessary some sort of consensus among the members of a group, very\r\nlittle can be said for it in aesthetics, where no practical issues are\r\ndirectly involved. There, herd instinct simply substitutes sham\r\nappreciation for a vital and healthy reaction. Of course, imitative\r\njudgments must be distinguished from those that agree because they are\r\nbased on a genuine contagion or community of feeling. This distinction\r\nmay be a difficult one for the outsider to make; but is not so for the\r\nindividual concerned. I do not deny the value of authority in aesthetics;\r\nwhat I am inveighing against is the substitution of authority for\r\nsincerity. In art, the suasion of the norm should be absolutely free,\r\nwith no penalty except isolation from the best. The only value of\r\nauthority is to counteract laziness and superficiality of appreciation;\r\nto stimulate those who would rest content with first impressions to\r\na more studious and attentive examination. Yet, however great be our\r\nnatural desire to convince others of beauty, we want their conviction\r\nto be as sincere as our own: we do not want it to be\r\nfactitious,--suggested or dragooned. It is often too easy, rather than\r\ntoo hard, to win agreement.\r\n\r\nThe question of the place of authority in aesthetics is raised again\r\nby a consideration of another class of pseudo-aesthetic judgments,\r\nwhich I shall call ignorant judgments. These judgments are perfectly\r\nsincere, but express an aesthetic experience that is imperfect, owing\r\nto defective understanding of art. So many people judge works of art\r\nas if they could assimilate them immediately, without any knowledge\r\nof their purpose and technique. They fail to recognize that a work of\r\nart has a language, with a vocabulary and grammar, which has to be\r\nmastered through study. A work of art is a possibility of a certain\r\ncomplex of values, not a given actuality that can be grasped by merely\r\nstretching out the hand. Very little of any work of art is given--just\r\na few sense stimuli; the rest is an emotional and meaningful reaction,\r\nwhich has to be completed in a determinate fashion. A work of art is\r\na question to which the right answer has to be found. And in order to\r\nfind the answer, it is necessary to know both what to look for and\r\nwhat not to look for. For example, in judging Japanese prints, one\r\nmust realize, from the limitation of the medium, that one cannot look\r\nfor all the fullness of expression of shadow and atmosphere possible\r\nin an oil painting; or in judging decorative or post-impressionistic\r\npainting, one must realize that the purpose of the artist is chiefly\r\nto obtain musical effects from color and line, not to represent nature\r\nrealistically.\r\n\r\nBecause works of art are ideals, possibilities of experience, and not\r\ngiven things which everybody can appreciate without knowledge and\r\neffort, I am skeptical of all results obtained in laboratories of\r\nexperimental aesthetics, where college students are asked to judge\r\nworks of painting, music, and sculpture. An uninstructed majority vote\r\ncannot decide any question in aesthetics. Such experiments, with the\r\nexception of those that concern the most elementary reactions, yield\r\ninteresting statistical results about the groups employed as subjects,\r\nbut are of no value in aesthetics. And what wonder that we should find\r\npeople disagreeing in their judgments when, because of ignorance, they\r\nare not reporting about the same objects!\r\n\r\nFinally, an aesthetic consensus is possible only if non-aesthetic\r\nstandards and all judgments based on false conceptions of the purpose\r\nof art are eliminated. Some of these judgments I have already\r\ndiscussed--the scientific and the moralistic. The purpose of art is\r\nsympathetic vision, not scientific truth or edification. It is often\r\nnecessary, in order to win a vision of actual life, for the artist to\r\npossess scientific knowledge; but only as a means, not as an end. And\r\nagain, insight into the more enduring preferences of men and the\r\nconditions of their happiness, upon which rational moral standards are\r\nfounded, is indispensable to a complete interpretation of life; but\r\nthere is much of life that can be envisaged sympathetically, that is,\r\nartistically and beautifully, with small hold on ethical wisdom. No\r\none, I suppose, would regard de Maupassant as a wise man in the Greek\r\nsense of possessing a philosophical grasp of the norms which make up\r\nthe conscience of men, yet few would deny him the supreme gift of\r\ndelineating the pathos and comedy of passion. I do not doubt that men\r\nwill always judge works of art from abstract standpoints; that to-day\r\nthey will judge them from the points of view of science and morals,\r\nsince we are so dominated by their sway; but I do claim that these\r\nstandards are not aesthetic, and that so long as they control our\r\nestimates of art, there can never be anything except chaos in taste;\r\nfor they will always come into conflict with the genuinely aesthetic\r\npoint of view. And, I ask, why not grant to art its autonomy? If art\r\nhas a unique purpose, different from that of science or morals, why\r\nshould we not judge it in terms of that purpose?\r\n\r\nOf course, since man's nature is one, not many, it will always be\r\nimpossible entirely to get rid of the non-aesthetic bases of judgment.\r\nPersonal predilection for a certain kind of subject-matter, patriotic\r\npreference for one's own language and style, the influence of authority\r\nand the lure of the crowd, the intrusion of the moralistic and the\r\nscientific bias,--all these must, to a greater or less degree, divide\r\nand dispute the hegemony of taste. Nevertheless, although it is\r\nimpossible to reach a pure aesthetic judgment, we ought to strive to\r\napproach it, and, by dint of training and clear thinking about art,\r\nwe can approach it. We ought to do this, not because of any formalism\r\nor purism, but for the sake of preserving the unique value of art,\r\nwhich is covered up or destroyed by the intrusion of non-aesthetic\r\nstandards of judgment. For judgment does influence feeling, especially\r\nsuch a delicate and subtle thing as aesthetic feeling. The patriotic\r\nand the partisan judgments narrow appreciation, the imitative substitute\r\na judgment for a feeling, the moralistic and scientific prejudices\r\noften inhibit the possibility of the aesthetic reaction at the start,\r\nor, if they allow it to begin, prevent the full sympathy and abandon\r\nwhich are required for its consummation. We can get scientific truth\r\nfrom science, why then seek it in art? We can obtain moral wisdom from\r\nthe philosopher and priest, why require it of the artist? Reformers\r\nand statesmen will enlighten us concerning reconstruction, why not\r\nturn to them? I do not mean, of course, that art may not express the\r\nmystery and the wonder of science, the voice of conscience, the cry\r\nof distress; but even this is not science, or sociology, or morals;\r\nand art must and should also express dark passion, hot hate or love,\r\nand joy--in the sea, in sunlight, in the shadow of leaves on the grass,\r\nin the bodies of men and women--and the other myriad forms of human\r\nlife and nature that are neither right nor true, but simply are. And\r\nfurthermore: the tyranny of the scientific and the moral is the death\r\nof art. Art can live only when free. So long as men are subject to the\r\nexclusive habit of condemning and praising and analyzing and\r\nclassifying, they are incapable of a free envisagement and expression.\r\nBetween sociology and Puritanism, the artistic novel and the drama\r\nhave become all but impossible in this country. During the nineteenth\r\ncentury, the predilection, among the Pre-Raphaelites, for the scientific\r\nand moral nearly killed landscape painting in England, its birthplace.\r\nAnd only in France, where alone of modern nations the moral and hygienic\r\nattitude towards the human body has not completely driven out the\r\nartistic, has there been a vital and enduring sculpture.\r\n\r\nIf the aesthetic judgment is given autonomy, a sure foundation for\r\naesthetic norms can be established, because then art will be judged\r\nwith reference to a perfectly definite purpose. Feeling will always\r\ntell us whether a thing is beautiful or not; but feeling itself will\r\ndepend upon whether the implicit purpose of art has been realized;\r\nand, when we reflectively consider a work in relation to other works,\r\nwe shall have a solid basis for comparison. Judgment will have a\r\nfoundation in reason as well as in feeling. We shall ask of the artist,\r\nnot whether he has instructed us or edified us, but solely whether he\r\nhas given us a new and sympathetic vision of some part of our\r\nexperience. The kind of vision that he gives us will depend, of course,\r\nupon the materials of his art--it will be one thing in sound, another\r\nin color or line or patterned words. Even as we demand of art in general\r\na unique value, as fulfilling a unique function, so we shall demand\r\nof the different arts that each provide us with the unique beauty which\r\nits materials can create. We shall therefore commend the separation\r\nof the arts and view with suspicion any attempt to fuse them. Whatever\r\nbe his materials, we shall demand of the artist always the same result:\r\nthat he make us see, and command our sympathy and delight for his\r\nvision. Any judgment that we make, or any standard that we set up,\r\nmust proceed upon a knowledge of this master purpose and of the\r\nmaterials and technique of the particular art through which it is to\r\nbe realized. And such standards, experimental and tentative, but\r\nnevertheless potent and directive, are capable of discovery and\r\nformulation. Some of the larger and more important of these we shall\r\ntry to set forth in our chapters on the special arts. An artist who\r\nworks within these standards is sure to produce something beautiful;\r\none who breaks them will fail or, rarely, find some hitherto\r\nundiscovered, surprising beauty in the medium.\r\n\r\nThere still remains for consideration the fear lest the recognition\r\nof standards may discourage new experiments and so interfere with the\r\ncreative impulse. It is true that tragedies have occurred when criticism\r\nhas been unsympathetic and malicious--remember Keats and the struggles\r\nof the early French impressionistic painters--but even then I doubt\r\nif any real harm to art has resulted. For the situation in aesthetics\r\ndiffers from the situation in ethics and politics where the retarding\r\neffect of convention is undeniable. In art there can never be the same\r\ncloseness of alliance between convention and vested interests that is\r\nso repressive a force in the \"world.\" It is probably true indeed that,\r\nas Plato said, \"when the modes of music change, so do constitutions\r\nchange\"; for example, there is doubtless to-day some connection between\r\nimagist poetry, post-impressionistic painting, Russian music, and\r\nrevolutionary sentiment--witness, in our own country, _The Masses_\r\nand _The Seven Arts_--but the link is too delicate to alarm the\r\npowers that be. The upholding of a standard must be allied with material\r\ninterests if it is to be repressive of creation and novelty. But, as\r\na free force, operating solely by influence, the standard has the\r\neffect only of keeping alive the love of excellence, and, by providing\r\nsome stability in the old, creating that contrast between the new and\r\nthe old, so stimulating to the new itself. For the impulse to originate\r\noperates best alongside of and in opposition to the desire to conserve.\r\nFrance has been the great originator in the plastic arts during recent\r\ntimes; but it has also been the only country where a genuine traditional\r\nstandard has existed. When tradition is based on experiments, as in\r\nart, it cannot be in essence hostile to them. And all valid aesthetic\r\nprinciples are sufficiently broad and abstract not to interfere with\r\nnovelty and creation.\r\n\r\nWhen such principles as we have tried to formulate are admitted, the\r\nworld of aesthetic judgments can be organized and some consensus about\r\nthe beautiful achieved. Without an approach to a consensus, the aesthetic\r\nimpulse can never be content; for it is indefeasibly sociable. Agreement\r\nin judgments depends upon a common experience, and this also art can\r\nprovide. For beauty is constituted of elementary reactions to sense\r\nstimuli which are well-nigh universal among men, and of symbols and\r\nmeanings which can be learned like any language. The delight in harmony\r\nand balance, order and symmetry and rhythm, and again, the pleasure\r\nin the unique and well finished, are felt by every one. The entire\r\nform side of art, its structure or design, is based on fundamental and\r\nenduring elements of human nature. The symbolism of sensation, its\r\nmusical expressiveness, as we have called it, is rooted likewise in\r\nreactions and interpretations that either are, or may become, through\r\nsuggestion and training, common property. There are, of course, the\r\npeople who have no feeling for tones, and through defective memory for\r\ntones, no appreciation of musical design; there are also those who are\r\ninsensitive to color and line. In many cases, through the training of\r\nthe attention, these defects can be overcome; yet, in others, they are\r\npermanent and incurable. This fact limits the universality of art;\r\noftentimes, when two people are discussing a work, they are not talking\r\nabout the same object; for a large part of its potentialities are lost\r\nto one of them. Nevertheless, the validity of empirical standards among\r\nthose who are capable of appreciating the whole of a work of art is\r\nnot touched by this fact. Those who can agree, ultimately will agree.\r\nAs for art as representation, that is a language readily acquired. It\r\nis an easier and more natural language than ordinary speech. What is\r\nmeant by the colors and lines of a painting or statue, or by the mimic\r\nof the drama, is immediately grasped by any intelligent person; for\r\nto make use of images of things in order to represent them is a\r\nuniversal habit among men. The painting and sculpture of the Chinese\r\nare intelligible to us; not so their speech. Of course, to some extent,\r\nthe language of painting and sculpture is conventional; the limits of\r\naccuracy of imitation are not set by nature, except at the extremes,\r\nbut by the tradition or practice of painters. Yet the convention is\r\na simple one, easily understood and accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE AESTHETICS OF MUSIC\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this and the following chapters which treat of the arts, I plan to\r\nmake a concrete application of the aesthetic theory thus far developed.\r\nI want to show how the general principles which we have tried to\r\nestablish can be used to explain the facts of our artistic experience.\r\nIn doing this I shall hope to achieve a double purpose: first, to\r\nverify anew our theory of art, and second, to deepen and enlighten\r\nappreciation.\r\n\r\nI begin with music because, as we shall see, there is a musical factor\r\nin all the arts, an understanding of which at the beginning will enable\r\nus to proceed much more easily in our survey of them. I shall confine\r\nmyself to an elementary analysis; for a more detailed study would take\r\nus beyond the bounds of general aesthetics and would require a knowledge\r\nof the special technique of the arts which we cannot presuppose.\r\nMoreover, we shall not concern ourselves with the origin or history\r\nof the arts further than is needful for an understanding of their\r\ngeneral character. We are investigating the theory, not the history,\r\nof taste, and are more interested in the present developed aesthetic\r\nconsciousness than in its rudimentary forms.\r\n\r\nAs we appreciate it to-day, music lends itself readily to our definition\r\nof art. It is a personal expression--who, when listening to music which\r\nhe enjoys, does not feel himself poured forth in the tones? It is\r\nsocial and public--what brings us together under the sway of a common\r\nemotion more effectively than concert or opera? It is a fixed and\r\npermanent expression, for we can renew it so long as men preserve the\r\nscore where it is written; and, finally, it is free--who can find any\r\npractical or moral or scientific purpose in an etude of Chopin or a\r\nsymphony of Mozart? Music is the most signal example of a mode of\r\nexpression that has attained to a complete and pure aesthetic character,\r\nan unmixed beauty. Yet this was not true of music in its earlier forms,\r\nand a long process of development was necessary before freedom was\r\nrealized. For we must look for the beginning of music in any and all\r\nsounds through which primitive men sought to express and communicate\r\nthemselves. These were, first of all, the cries of the human voice,\r\nexpressive of fear and need and joy--at once direct outpourings of\r\nbasic emotions and signals to one's fellows, to help, to satisfy, and\r\nto sympathize. In the voice nature provided man with a direct and\r\nimmediate instrument for the expression and communication of himself\r\nthrough sound. Then, perhaps by accident, man discovered that he could\r\nmake sounds in other ways, through materials separate from his body,\r\nand so he constructed drums and cymbals and gongs; and by means of\r\nthese, too, he communicated his needs and stimulated himself to rage\r\nand excitement--and his enemy to fear--in war dance and battle rush.\r\nAnd in doing this he was imitating nature, whose noises, exciting and\r\nterrifying, he had long known: the clap of thunder, the whistle of the\r\nwind, the roar of the waves, the crackling of burning wood, the crash\r\nof fallen and breaking things.\r\n\r\nOut of unbeautiful noise sprang beautiful music. Men discovered that\r\nthrough the voice they could make not only expressive noises, but also\r\npleasant tones; they found, perhaps by accident, that they could do\r\nmuch the same thing with reeds and strings; they observed that when\r\nthey beat their drums at regular intervals to mark the motion of the\r\ndance, they not only danced together more easily, but also experienced\r\njoy in the very sounds they made; or that when they threshed the corn\r\nwith rhythmic strokes or rowed a boat in rhythmic unison, their task\r\nwas lightened and their wearied attention distracted to the pleasure\r\nof their noise. Hence at their dances of love or war or religion, they\r\nsang instead of shouted; and their instruments of irregular and\r\nexpressive noise became instruments of rhythmical and melodious tones.\r\nEventually, having experienced the pleasure there is in tones and\r\nrhythmical sounds, they made them for their own sake, apart from any\r\nconnection with tribal festivals, and the free art of music was born.\r\nAnd yet, as we shall see, the significance of music depends largely\r\nupon the fact that tones are akin to noises; music could not take such\r\na hold of the emotions of men did they not overhear in the tones the\r\nmeaningful and poignant noises of voice and nature; to understand\r\nmusic, we must think of it against its background of expressive noise.\r\nIn music we still seem to hear a voice that breaks the silence and\r\nspeaks, the thunder that terrifies.\r\n\r\nThe material of music consists of tones, the conscious counterparts\r\nof periodic, longitudinal vibrations of the air. Tones differ among\r\nthemselves in many attributes, of which the following are of chief\r\nimportance for music: pitch, determined by rate of vibration, through\r\nwhich tones differ as higher and lower; color, determined by the\r\ncomplexity of the vibration wave, the presence of overtones of different\r\npitch along with the fundamental tone in the total sound; intensity,\r\ndependent upon the amplitude of the vibration, through which tones of\r\nthe same pitch differ as soft or loud; and finally, quality, that\r\nspecific character of a tone, by reason of which middle C, for example,\r\nis more like the C of the octave below or above than like its nearer\r\nneighbors, B or D, whence the series of tones, although in pitch linear\r\nand one-dimensional, is in quality periodic, returning again and again\r\nupon itself, as we go up or down the scale. [Footnote: \"See Geza Revesz:\r\n_Tonpsychologie_.\"]\r\n\r\nThe number of qualities in use in music--twelve in our scale of equal\r\ntemperament--is, of course, not all there are in the world of tones;\r\nthey are a human and arbitrary selection, governed by technical and\r\nhistorical motives, into which we shall not enter. Peoples with a\r\ndifferent culture have made a different selection. But we are not\r\nconcerned with the music of angels or of orientals, but with our own.\r\nWith these twelve, with their possible variations in pitch, loudness,\r\nand tone-color, the musician has a rich and adequate material.\r\n\r\nAll the elements of an aesthetic experience are present in striking\r\nsimplicity even in the single musical tone. There is the sensuous\r\nmedium, the sound; there is a life expressed, a feeling aroused in us,\r\nyet so completely objectified in the sound that it seems to belong to\r\nthe latter on equal terms with color or quality or loudness; there is\r\na unity and variety and orderly structure in the dominance of the\r\nfundamental among the overtones and the fusion of all in the total\r\nclang. Thus every note is a complete little aesthetic organism. Yet\r\nthe beauty of single tones is very slight,--less, I think, than that\r\nof single colors; they need the contrast or the agreement in consonance\r\nwith other tones in order to awaken much feeling; they must be members\r\nof a wider whole; observe how, when sounded after other tones, they\r\nbecome enriched through the contrasting or consonant memory of those\r\ntones. Nevertheless, the single tone has its feeling, however slight,\r\nand to understand this is to go a long way toward understanding the\r\nmore complex structures of music.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, tones, unlike noises, are all pleasant. Although\r\nwe cannot be sure why this is true, there can be little doubt, I think,\r\nthat the regularity of the vibrations of the former, in contrast with\r\nthe irregularity of the latter, is largely responsible. The clang,\r\nwith its ordered complexity, is a stimulus that incites the sense organ\r\nand connected motor tracts to a unified and definite response, unlike\r\nnoise, which creates confusion. The pleasure in the single tone is\r\nsimilar, in its causes, to the pleasure in the consonance of two tones.\r\nAs we should expect from this analogy, the pleasure is greater in rich\r\ntones, which contain many partials, than in thin tones, which are\r\nrelatively uninteresting. But the feeling of tones is something more\r\nthan mere pleasantness; it is also a mood. Now this mood of tones is\r\npartly due to associations,--some superficial in character, like the\r\npastoral quality of flute tones or the martial character of bugle\r\ntones, others more fundamental; but it has also a still deeper-lying\r\nroot. For a sound stimulus awakens not only a sensory process in the\r\near, the correlative of which is a sensation, but also incipient motor\r\nreactions, which, if carried out, would be an emotion, but which, being\r\ntoo slight and diffuse, produce only what we call a mood. Every\r\nsensation has a meaning for the organism in an environment where it\r\nhas constantly to be on its guard for danger or assistance; every\r\nsensation is therefore connected with the mechanism of reaction, with\r\nits attendant emotions. In ordinary experience, there are objects\r\npresent to which the organism may actually respond, but in the aesthetic\r\nexperience there are no real objects towards which a significant\r\nreaction can take place; in music, the source of the sound is obviously\r\nof no practical importance, while in such arts as painting and sculpture\r\nwhere interesting objects are represented, the objects themselves are\r\nabsent; hence the reaction is never carried out, but remains incipient,\r\na vague feeling which, finding no object upon which it may work itself\r\noff, is suffused upon the sensation. These sense feelings are the\r\nsubtle, but basal, material of all beauty.\r\n\r\nThe variety of moods expressed in tones is almost endless. When we\r\nexperience them, they come to us as the inner life of the total concrete\r\ntones, but they depend actually upon the working together of all the\r\ntonal attributes,--color, quality, pitch, and loudness. There is the\r\nsubtle intimacy of violin tones compared with the clear arresting ring\r\nof the trumpet; the emotional differences between qualities like C and\r\nG, too delicate for expression in words; the piercing excitement of\r\nthe high, bright tones, compared with the earnest depth of the low,\r\ndull tones; the almost terrifying effect of loud tones compared with\r\nthe soothing influence of soft tones.\r\n\r\nThe precise psychophysical mechanism through which the different moods\r\nare aroused is for the most part hidden from us; yet in certain\r\nparticulars we can form some idea of it. For example, the richness of\r\nfeeling in the tones of certain instruments as compared with others\r\nis doubtless due to the fact that through the presence of more overtones\r\nand the admixture of noise, the reaction is more complex; the tense\r\nexcitement of high and loud tones, as compared with the soft and low,\r\nis probably connected with the fact that their higher vibration rate\r\nand greater amplitude of vibration produce a more marked effect, a\r\nmore pervasive disturbance,--the organism does not right itself and\r\nrecover so rapidly and easily. These direct and native elements of\r\nfeeling are then broadened out and intensified through other elements\r\nthat come in by way of association. For example, in order to sing high\r\ntones, a greater tension and exertion of the vocal chords is needed\r\nthan for low tones; loud tones suggest loud noises, which, as in\r\nbreaking and crashing and thundering, are inevitably associated with\r\nfear; the loud is also the near and present and threatening, the low\r\nis distant and safe. Although each tone, as separate and individual,\r\npossesses its own feeling in its own right, the tonal effects are\r\nimmensely accentuated by contrast with one another,--the high against\r\nthe low, the poor against the rich, the loud against the soft--and\r\nthrough the summation, by means of repetition, of the influences of\r\nmany tones of like character; the full meaning of music depends upon\r\nthe relations of tones, especially the temporal relations.\r\n\r\nThis fact was fully recognized by Aristotle, who raised the question\r\nwhy tones are so much more expressive than colors. Music is almost the\r\nsole important art that relies on the expressiveness of the sense\r\nmaterial alone, independent of any element of meaning. To be sure, the\r\nbeauty of oriental rugs depends entirely on their color and line\r\nharmonies; for the meanings which the patterns have for their oriental\r\nmakers is generally unknown to us of the western world; yet what we\r\nfeel when we contemplate them cannot compare in volume and intensity\r\nwith what we experience when we listen to music. And Aristotle correctly\r\nassigned one of the chief reasons for the superior significance of\r\nmusic--its temporal character. A color or line scheme may express a\r\nmomentary mood, with perhaps just the most rudimentary movement as we\r\ngo from the dark to the bright colors, or as we follow the motion of\r\nthe lines as they curve or converge; yet it cannot express an action\r\nor process that begins, proceeds, continues, ends. When we look at the\r\ncolors or lines of a painting or rug, we feel intensely, but there is\r\nno development or process of feeling; if the mind moves, it moves\r\ninevitably not with, but away from, what it sees. But tones are given\r\nto us in succession; we are forced to move with them; hence they come\r\nto express for us, in ways which we shall try to analyze, the changing\r\nand developing process of the inner life.\r\n\r\nIn its temporal aspect, music has two chief characteristics, rhythm\r\nand melody. In our music these are inseparable; yet they can be\r\nseparated for the purposes of analysis; and a rhythmical roll of\r\ndrumbeats or a careless succession of tones harmonically related proves\r\nthat each may produce an aesthetic effect without the other. We shall\r\nconsider melody first.\r\n\r\nA mere succession of tones, however pleasing separately, does not make\r\na melody; for melody depends on a definite scale and on certain\r\nrelations between the tones of the scale. These relations illustrate\r\nthe three modes of aesthetic unity. First, there is harmony. Tones are\r\nharmonically related when they belong to the leading chords of the\r\nkey. The tones of such chords, when sounded together, are consonant.\r\nNow harmony, which is an aesthetic feeling, although not identical with\r\nconsonance, which is a purely sensory relation between tones, depends\r\nnevertheless upon consonance. In order to understand harmony, we must\r\ntherefore first understand consonance, and, in order to do this, we\r\nmust begin by describing the experience and then look for its possible\r\ncauses. [Footnote: Consult the discussions in Karl Stumpf,\r\nTonpsychologie; Carl Emil Seashore, The Psychology of Musical Talent,\r\nchap. VII.] As for the first, consonant tones, when sounded together,\r\nseem to fit one another, almost to fuse, despite the fact that the\r\ndifferent tones are distinguishable in the whole. This fitting together,\r\nin turn, seems to depend on a resemblance or partial identity between\r\nthem. For example, the most consonant tones are a note and its octave,\r\nwhich are, perhaps, actually identical in quality; but lesser intervals\r\nare also alike, as for example a note and its fifth, which are more\r\nreadily mistaken for one another than two dissonant tones, say a note\r\nand its seventh. As for the explanation of consonance, we know that\r\nconsonant tones have identical partial tones and are caused by vibration\r\nrates that stand to one another in simple ratios. Thus in a clang\r\ncomposed of a tone and its fifth, the first partial of the fifth is\r\nthe second partial of the prime, and the vibration ratios are as two\r\nto three. The bearing of this second fact on the question of partial\r\nidentity will become clear if we consider the concrete case of a tone\r\nproduced by 24 vibrations per second, whose fifth would then be produced\r\nby 36 vibrations per second, and then consider the same tone and its\r\ndissonant second, the ratio of whose vibrations is 24 to 27; in the\r\nformer case, there is a common part of 6 vibrations, a fourth of the\r\ntotal number of the first tone; in the latter, only 3, an eighth. That\r\nidentity of partial tones is not a sufficient explanation of\r\nconsonance--as Helmholtz thought it to be--is proved by the fact that\r\nsimple tones, which have no partials, may still be consonant.\r\nNevertheless, an identity of partials does undoubtedly contribute to\r\nthe consonance of the complex tones used in our music; ultimately,\r\nhowever, the final reason for consonance must be sought in some\r\nunderlying identity within the tones themselves, an identity that seems\r\nto be given psychologically in their resemblance, and with which\r\nphysically the simplicity of their vibration ratios probably has\r\nsomething to do. And that in music the feeling of harmony should depend\r\nupon partial identity is what we should expect from our previous study\r\nof harmony in general. [Footnote: See page 87.]\r\n\r\nThe second of the tonal relations upon which melody depends is contrast.\r\nFirst, there is the contrast between the high and the low; even when\r\nnotes are harmonically related, as a note and its fifth, they are in\r\ncontrast, in so far as the one is measurably higher and more distant\r\nthan the other. Of equal importance is the rivalry between the\r\nfundamental tones in the leading harmonic chords; for example, the\r\nrivalry between the tonic and the dominant. For each of these claims\r\nto be the center of the melodic progression, and draws to itself all\r\nthe tones which belong to its chord. Dissonance is a cause of rivalry;\r\nfor a dissonant tone is one that will not fit into a given harmony;\r\nyet since it is still a part of the melody, must have its home\r\nsomewhere, and belongs therefore in another harmony, which, through\r\nthis tone, is set up in rivalry with the prevailing one. A tone that\r\ndid not belong to any harmony would not be a dissonance, but a\r\ndiscord,--a tone without meaning musically. Dissonances, like other\r\ncontrasts, enrich the melody by establishing rival harmonies; discords\r\ndestroy melodies. Just as the drama has little significance without\r\nconflict, so melodies are uninteresting without dissonances.\r\n\r\nWere it not for the third of the tonal relations, melodies would lack\r\nunity and system and go to pieces under the stress of rival forces.\r\nThis third relation may be call finality; [Footnote: The explanation\r\nof this is obscure; there is no unanimity among the specialists in\r\nmusical theory.] it belongs among relations we have called evolutionary.\r\nBy it is meant the fact that certain tones demand and naturally lead\r\ninto other tones, in which they seem to find their completion or\r\nfulfillment. For example, the tones of a chord demand the fundamental\r\ntone of the chord; dissonances must be \"resolved,\"--must be followed\r\nby other tones of their own harmony; the diatonic tones over and above\r\nthe tonic--the \"upleader\" and \"downleader\"--naturally lead into the\r\ntonic; and all the tones demand, either immediately or through the\r\nmediation of other tones, the tonic of the scale to which they belong.\r\nThis principle of finality, which, in the classic music, is the basis\r\nof what is called \"tonality,\" by establishing the tonic as the center\r\nof reference and point of completion of all tones, gives to melody its\r\ndramatic unity. Through it, by creating the tonic chord as fundamental,\r\nthe rivalry between the tonic, dominant, and subdominant is overcome,\r\nand all dissonances finally resolved into unity. Definite scales and\r\ntonal laws and schemes of composition are of the utmost importance for\r\nmusical composition; there are, of course, many of these besides the\r\nclassical, and they are all partly conventional; but that does not\r\nmatter so long as, by being well known, they enable the melody to move\r\nalong definite lines, arousing and fulfilling definite expectations.\r\nThose forms of modernist music that dispense with scales altogether,\r\nin which therefore there are no fixed _points de repere_ like the\r\ntonic or dominant of the older music, can express chance momentary\r\nmoods by means of rich and strange colors, but not an orderly and\r\npurposeful experience.\r\n\r\nOf course, in our modern harmonic music the melodic movement proceeds\r\nby means, not of single tones, but of chords. Yet no new principle is\r\nintroduced by this fact. For the chords have in part merely the\r\nsignificance of highly enriched tones, the harmonized tones of the\r\nchords taking the place of the partials of the single notes and\r\nimparting a more voluminous color, which may have its own beauty as\r\nsuch; and, in addition, they simply confer upon the melody another\r\ndimension, as it were, the tonal relations of harmony and contrast\r\noperating between the tones of the chords simultaneously, as well as\r\ntemporally between the successive elements of the melody.\r\n\r\nThe orderly beauty which the tonal relations confer upon music is\r\nfurther enriched and complicated by rhythm. Rhythm in music is of two\r\nsorts: a rhythm of time and a rhythm of accent, or increased loudness.\r\nThrough the one, the duration of a musical composition is divided up\r\ninto approximately equal parts filled by notes and rests of definite\r\nlength, and through the other, the light notes are subordinated to the\r\nheavy notes. The two, however, are interrelated; for the bars are\r\ndivided from each other by the accents, and the accents recur at\r\napproximately equal intervals.\r\n\r\nThe pleasure in rhythmical arrangement is derived from two sources:\r\nfirst, from the need for perspicuity which is fulfilled through the\r\nregular grouping of the tonal elements in the bars,--their length being\r\nadjusted to the average length of an attention wave, and the number\r\nof tones that fill them to the number of items which can be taken in\r\nat one act of attention,--and through the subordination of the light\r\nto the heavy within the bars, the bars to the measures, and the measures\r\nto the periods. The second source of satisfaction in rhythm is the\r\ncombination of feelings of balance and harmony aroused--a rhythm is\r\nnot only a pleasing perspicuous order, but an emotion. [Footnote: See\r\nchap. V, p.90] For every recurring accent and interval competes with\r\nits predecessor for the mind's attention, yet is in agreement with it\r\nsince it, too, fulfills the law that pervades them all.\r\n\r\nThe full significance of both melody and rhythm depends, however, upon\r\ntheir interrelation, the concrete musical structure, the motive or\r\nmelody in the complete sense, being an indissoluble unity of both. Now\r\nif we take the term will with a broad meaning, Schopenhauer's\r\ncharacterization of melody as an image of the will still remains the\r\ntruest aesthetic interpretation of it. For, when we hear it, we not\r\nonly hear, but attend to what we hear; we hear each tone in its\r\nrelations of harmony or contrast or fulfillment to other tones,\r\nfreighted with memories of its predecessors and carrying with it\r\nexpectations, which the following tones fulfill or deny. The melody\r\nbegins, let us suppose, with the tonic note. This note then becomes\r\nfor us a plan or purpose; for as it goes, it leaves in the mind a\r\nmemory of itself, no mere pale sensation--no image ever is--but a motor\r\nset, an expectation and desire to hear the note again. If the next\r\nnote is harmonically related, this purpose is partially fulfilled and\r\nwe get the satisfaction of a partial success. If, however, the tone\r\ndoes not belong to the tonic chord, but, let us suppose, to the\r\nsubdominant, it comes as a hindrance, an obstacle, or perhaps as a new\r\nand rival purpose springing up in the course of the fulfillment of the\r\nold,--a purpose which can be satisfied only through the other tones\r\nof its chord. Hence the tension of conflicting expectations and the\r\nexcitement as now the one and now the other is fulfilled in the\r\nsucceeding notes. Yet, since all other harmonies are subordinated to\r\nthe tonic harmony, and even through their very opposition increase our\r\ndesire for it, they must give way to the fundamental purpose with which\r\nwe started; and when the tonic does eventually triumph, it fulfills\r\nnot only itself, but all lesser desires of the melody; in it we find\r\nwhat we have been seeking, we arrive where we set out to go. And in\r\nthis success we not only obtain what we first wanted, but more--an\r\nexperience enriched by every conflict, and harmonious ultimately through\r\nthe inner adjustment and resolution of its elements; for in hearing\r\nthe final note we hear the memories of all previous tones, also. When\r\nthe departures from the keynote are many and distant and sudden, and\r\nthe melody wanders into the bypaths of foreign harmonies, moving along\r\nbroken and zigzag lines, it expresses an exciting, a dangerous and\r\ndifficult adventure; when, however, the departures are gradual and\r\nconfined for the most part within the limits of a single harmony,\r\nmoving in a smooth and curving path, it expresses a life that is secure\r\nand happy, tending to repose as the line approaches the horizontal,\r\nand as repetitions of the same note predominate.\r\n\r\nRhythm enters into melody to differentiate and emphasize. By means of\r\naccent and time-value, the different tones are weighted and their\r\nrelative value fixed. The heavy tones assert their will with a more\r\ninsistent energy; the long tones upon which we linger make a deeper\r\nand more lasting impression; while the light and short tones in contrast\r\nbecome points of mere passing and transition. If, moreover, we include\r\nthe element of tempo, then all the temporal feelings are introduced\r\ninto melody--the excitement of rapid motion, the calmness of the slow;\r\nthe agony of delay, of waiting and postponement, with the triumph and\r\nrelief when the expected note arrives at last. Finally, the effects\r\nof shading must be added, the contrasts between piano and\r\nforte--loudness that brings the tones so near that they may seem\r\nthreatening in their insistence; softness that makes them seem far\r\naway and dreamlike.\r\n\r\nFollowing the large idea introduced by Schopenhauer, which was enriched\r\nby the minuter studies of Lotze, Wundt, and Lipps, we may sum the\r\nforegoing analysis in the statement that music expresses the abstract\r\naspects of action, its ease or difficulty, its advance or retrocession,\r\nits home coming or its wandering, its hesitation or its surety, its\r\nconflicts and its contrasts, its force or its weakness, its swiftness\r\nor slowness, its abruptness or smoothness, its excitement or repose,\r\nits success or failure, its seriousness or play. Then, in addition,\r\nas we shall see, all modes of emotion that are congruous with this\r\nabstract form may by association be poured into its mold, so that the\r\ncontent of music becomes not a mere form of life, but life itself.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, obvious that our analysis has confined itself to the\r\nbarest elements of the musical experience. Our music to-day, with its\r\nmany-voiced harmonies, with its procession of chords instead of single\r\ntones, with its modulation into related keys, has an infinite wealth\r\nand complexity defying description. A large part of the astonishing\r\neffect of music is derived from the fact that in a brief space we seem\r\nto hear and absorb so much: the careers of multitudinous lives\r\ncompressed into an instant. Yet the meaning of the complex whole can\r\nbe understood, I think, from such an analysis of the simple structure\r\nas has been given.\r\n\r\nThe methods by which the larger musical wholes are built up illustrate\r\nprinciples of aesthetic structure with which we are already familiar.\r\nThere is the harmonious unification of parts through the simple\r\nrepetition of motives, their inversion or imitation in higher or lower\r\nkeys, either successively or simultaneously; the execution of the same\r\ntheme in another time or tempo; and through the interweaving of themes.\r\nThere is the balance of contrasted or competing themes; the\r\nsubordination of the lesser to the more striking and insistent motives;\r\nthe preparation for, emergence and triumph of, a final passage that\r\nresolves all dissonances and adjusts all conflicts. Because of music's\r\nabstractness, the connection between the parts of a musical composition\r\nmay be loose or subtle, taxing the synthetic powers even of the educated\r\nlistener; yet some contrast or analogy of feeling must always unite\r\nthem. The structure of the whole may be either static or dramatic; in\r\nthe former case the dramatic element is confined to the themes, the\r\npurpose of the whole being merely to work out all their significant\r\nvariations,--to embroider and repeat them in new keys and rhythms and\r\ntempos, and to contrast them with other themes. Repetition is the great\r\ncreative principle of musical development, the composer seeking to say\r\nover again in ever new forms what he has said before. And this, again\r\nbecause of the abstractness of music, is a significant process; to\r\nrepeat the concrete is tiresome and trivial, but an abstract form is\r\nalways enriched by appearing in a new shape.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of musical expression thus far given, although it\r\nsuffices to account for the basis of all musical feeling, is, I think,\r\ninadequate to its full volume and intensity. There is a concreteness\r\nof emotional content in some musical compositions--an arousal of terror\r\nand longing and despair and joy--infinitely richer than any abstract\r\nforms of feeling.\r\n\r\nTo account for this, two sources of explanation suggest themselves.\r\nFirst, the arousing of emotions through deep-lying effects of rhythm.\r\nIt is a well-known fact, cited in most discussions of this subject,\r\nthat the motor mechanism of the body is somehow attuned to rhythm.\r\nWhen we hear rhythmical sounds, we not only follow them with the\r\nattention, we follow them also with our muscles, with hand and foot\r\nand head and heart and respiratory apparatus. Even when we do not\r\nvisibly move in unison with the rhythm--as we usually do not--we tend\r\nto do so, which proves that in any case the motor mechanism of the\r\nbody is stimulated and brought into play by the sounds. There is a\r\ndirect psychophysical connection between the hearing of rhythmic sounds\r\nand the tendency to execute certain movements. But there is an equally\r\ndirect relation between emotions and tendencies to movements, through\r\nwhich the former find expression and are given effect in the outer\r\nworld. To every kind of emotion--love and hate and fear and sorrow and\r\njoy--there corresponds a specific mode of motor manifestation. The\r\nconnection between rhythmic sound and emotion is therefore plain; the\r\nlink is a common motor scheme. Rhythms arouse into direct and immediate\r\nactivity the motor \"sets\" that are the physical basis of the emotions,\r\nand hence arouse the corresponding emotions themselves, without any\r\nground for them outside of the organism. And these emotions, since\r\nthey are aroused by the sounds and not by any object to which they\r\nmight be directed and upon which they might work themselves off in a\r\nmeaningful reaction, are interwoven into the sounds,--they and the\r\nsounds come to us as a single indissoluble whole of experience. The\r\nemotions become the content of the sounds. And hence the strangeness\r\nof the musical experience--the fact that we feel so deeply over nothing.\r\n\r\nThe second cause for the concreteness of the musical experience I take\r\nto be certain emotions and feelings which are aroused by association,\r\nnot with the rhythmic elements of music alone, but with the tone-color,\r\nintensity, and melody also. There is a human quality, a poignancy and\r\nintimacy, about much music, which can be understood only through its\r\nanalogy with the sounds of the human voice. For the human voice is\r\nemotionally expressive through its mere sound alone: one can know a\r\nlarge part of what is going on in the breasts of people who talk in\r\na foreign tongue just by listening to the sound of their voices--their\r\nexcitement or boredom, their anger, love, or resentment; and one becomes\r\nconscious of these emotions, as in hearing music, without knowing what\r\nthey are all about. All human emotions betray themselves in speech\r\nthrough the rise and fall, range of intervals, loudness or softness,\r\ntempo and differences of duration of tone. Now, although it is far too\r\nmuch to say that music is actually an imitation of the voice, it is\r\nnevertheless true, as Diderot thought, that in certain musical passages\r\nwe overhear the voice. There is never any exact similarity between\r\nmusic and vocal sounds, but there is enough resemblance to awaken by\r\nassociation the feelings that are the normal accompaniments of such\r\nsounds. Any tone analogies that there happen to be are felt as such.\r\nThis is notably true of all music that has a peculiar lyrical and human\r\nquality,--the music that readily becomes popular because it seems to\r\nspeak direct to the heart. Originally, all music was song, and since\r\nspeech and song employ the same organ, it would be surprising indeed\r\nif something of the same expression of the emotions that overflows\r\ninto the one should not also overflow into the other, and that musicians\r\nshould not, unconsciously or consciously, tend to choose their melodies\r\nbecause of such analogies. Instrumental music probably got its first\r\nmelodies from song, and despite its vast present complexity and\r\nindependence, has never completely lost touch with song. Since the\r\nfirst meaningful sounds that we hear are those of the voice, music\r\nmust always have for us the significance of a glorified speech.\r\n\r\nThe fault of the original proposers of the speech theory was that they\r\nthought it a complete explanation of the facts of musical expression.\r\nIts explanatory value is, however, strictly limited, and supplemental\r\nto the more basic considerations adduced; yet it remains a necessary\r\npart of the complex theory of the complex fact we are studying. And\r\nthe acceptance of it as such does not imply a belief in the speech\r\ntheory of the origin of music. Song did not grow out of impassioned\r\nspeech, but arose coeval with speech, when men found--perhaps by\r\naccident--that they could make with their voices pure and pleasing\r\ntones and intervals of tones, and express something of their inner\r\nselves in so doing. Yet, as I have suggested, it would be strange if\r\nspeech did not react upon song--if the first vocal tones were not\r\npurified words, and the first intervals an approximation to those of\r\nspeech. Thus in song, lyric poetry and music arose together as a single\r\nart for the expression of feeling, until the development of instrumental\r\nmusic freed the one and the invention of writing freed the other; while\r\nspeech kept to its different and original purpose--the expression of\r\nideas for practical ends, and produced an aesthetic form of its own\r\nonly at a later period and under independent influences.\r\n\r\nThe complete understanding of musical expression involves, finally,\r\nas was suggested at the beginning of this chapter, the recognition of\r\nthe analogy that exists between music and the noises produced by nature\r\nand human activities. Through the imitation of their rhythm, force,\r\nand tempo, some of these can be directly suggested by musicians. Yet\r\nthis direct suggestion, although employed by the greatest composers,\r\nplays a subordinate part in music, and, since it introduces an element\r\nof representation of the outer world--_tonmalerei_--is usually\r\nfelt to involve a departure from the prime purpose of music: the\r\nexpression of the inner world through the emotional effects of pure\r\nsound. In the best program music, therefore, the purpose of the composer\r\nis not the mere imitation of nature--which is never art at all, and\r\nin music is always recognized as an unsaesthetic _tour de force_\r\nof mere cleverness--but rather the arousal of the feelings caused by\r\nnature. And as an aid in the expression of such feelings, imitation,\r\nwhen delicately suggestive rather than blatant, will always play a\r\npart.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, subtler and remoter analogies between music and\r\nnoise, which produce their effects whether the musician wills them or\r\nnot. Such, for example, are loud bursts of tone suggesting falling or\r\ncrashing, events which usually have a terrifying significance;\r\ncrescendoes, suggesting the approach of things, so often full of\r\nexpectancy and excitement; diminuendoes, suggesting a gradual departure\r\nor fading away, bearing relief or regret. And there are doubtless\r\nhundreds of other such associations, too minute or remote or long-\r\nforgotten to recover, which add their mite of feeling to swell and\r\nmake vast the musical emotion. As Fechner pointed out, these\r\nassociations may work quite unconsciously, giving evidence of their\r\nfunctioning only through the feeling tones which they release. So\r\nimportant is the part which sound plays in our lives that there must\r\nbe an especially large number of such underground associations aroused\r\nby music. All of our experiences are connected together by subconscious\r\nfiliation; but it is only in art that their residual feeling tones\r\nhave a full opportunity to come into the mind; for in everyday life\r\nthey are crowded out by the hurry of practical concerns. In the earlier\r\nstages of the development of music they must have contributed a still\r\nlarger share to musical expression, when the different forms of music\r\nwere connected by habit and convention with particular crises and\r\noccasions, religious, domestic, and social, in the life of individuals\r\nand groups. But even to-day, despite the new freedom of music, they\r\nare not absent.\r\n\r\nLooking back over our analysis of music, we see that it is characterized\r\nby the expression of emotion without the representation of the causes\r\nor objects of emotion. This fact, which has now become a well-recognized\r\npart of aesthetic theory, distinguishes music from all the other arts.\r\nMusic supplies us with no definite images of nature, as painting and\r\nsculpture do, and with no ideas, as poetry does. It contains feelings,\r\nbut no meanings. Music offers us no background for emotion, no objects\r\nupon which it may be directed, no story, no _mise en scene_. It\r\nsupplies us with the feeling tones of things and events, but not with\r\nthe things or events themselves. It moves wholly in a world of its\r\nown, a world of pure feeling, with no embodiment save only sound. It\r\nmay express terror, but not terror over this or that; joy, but whether\r\nthe joy that comes from sight of the morning or of the beloved, it\r\ncannot tell. In one brief space of time, it may arouse despair, hope,\r\ntriumph--but all over nothing.\r\n\r\nYet--and this is the central paradox of music--despite its abstractness,\r\nnay, because of this very quality, it remains the most personal and\r\nintimate of the arts. For, itself offering no images of things and\r\nevents to which we may attach the feelings which it arouses, we supply\r\nour own. We fill in the impersonal form of musical feeling with the\r\nconcrete emotions of our own lives; it is our strivings, our hopes and\r\nfears, which music expresses. By denying us access to the world about\r\nus, music compels us to turn in upon ourselves; it is we who live there\r\nin the sounds. For, as we have seen, the rhythmic tones seize hold not\r\nonly of our attention, but of our bodies also--hand and foot and head\r\nand heart, resounding throughout the whole organism. And, where our\r\nbodies are, there are we. Moreover, our life there in the sounds need\r\nnot remain without objects because the music does not describe them\r\nto us; for out of our own inner selves we may build up an imaginary\r\nworld for our feelings. As we listen to the music, we shall see the\r\nthings we hope for or fear or desire; or else transport ourselves among\r\npurely fanciful objects and events. Music is a language which we all\r\nunderstand because it expresses the basic mold of all emotion and\r\nstriving; yet it is a language which no two people understand in the\r\nsame way, because each pours into that mold his own unique experience.\r\nIn itself abstract and objectless, it may thus become, in varying ways,\r\nconcrete and alive.\r\n\r\nThe great variety in the interpretation of musical compositions has\r\noften been used as an argument against the existence of emotions in\r\nmusic, but is, as we have seen, the inevitable result of their\r\nabstractness. This abstractness may, indeed, be so great that apparently\r\nopposite concrete emotions, such as love and religious adoration,\r\ndespair and joy, may be aroused in different people, according to\r\ndifferent circumstances, by the same piece. The music of the opera can\r\nbe used in the cathedral. Yet strikingly dissimilar emotions have\r\ncommon elements--worship is the love of God; joy may be a rage equally\r\nwith disappointment; and at their highest intensity, all opposed\r\nemotions tend to pass over into each other: hope into fear, love into\r\nhate, exaltation into depression. The elementary feelings out of which\r\nour complex emotions are built are few and simple; hence each one of\r\nthe latter is identical in some ingredients with the others. And even\r\nthe elementary feelings may have common aspects of intensity and tempo,\r\nof strain and excitement. Some musical compositions, like the fugues\r\nof Bach, seem to express nothing more than such extremely abstract\r\nmodes of feeling, without arousing any associations that would impel\r\nthe mind to make a more concrete interpretation. To express feelings\r\nof this kind in language is, of course, impossible, for the reason\r\nthat our emotional vocabularies have been constructed to communicate\r\nonly the emotions of everyday life. Other types of music--like the\r\nromantic tone poetry of a later day--which are more abundant in their\r\nassociations, and hence richer in their emotional content, are difficult\r\nof translation for another reason: the rapidity of succession and\r\nsubtlety of intermixture of the expressed feelings are beyond the reach\r\nof words, even of a poet's, which inevitably stabilize and isolate\r\nwhat they denote.\r\n\r\nBut abstract and objectless emotions occur in other regions of\r\nexperience beside the musical, even beyond the entire field of the\r\naesthetic. All except the most healthy-minded and practical people are\r\nat times filled with vague fears, longings, and joys, the objects or\r\ncauses of which they cannot formulate. Normally, feeling is directed\r\ntowards definite objects and leads to action upon them, but may\r\nnevertheless become isolated from its proper connections, and function\r\nwithout issue. The extreme cases of this are the pathological states\r\nof mania and depression, where such feelings assume proportions\r\ndangerous to the existence of the individual. Intoxication and hysteria\r\npresent analogous, though more transient phenomena. And one may observe\r\nthe autonomous development of mere feeling even in the healthy life,\r\nas when one remains jolly after all occasion for it has ceased, or\r\nangry after the cause for anger has been removed. All feelings tend\r\nto acquire a strength beyond what is necessary for action and to endure\r\nafter their proper objects and conditions have disappeared; hence the\r\nluxury of grief and revenge and sentimentality.\r\n\r\nIn their most general character, musical emotions stand on a level\r\nwith other purposeless emotions, except that they are deliberately\r\ninduced and elaborated to an extent and complexity unmatched elsewhere.\r\nBut while these emotions are morbid and evil outside of music, within\r\nmusic they are innocent. For outside of music they spring from\r\ndislocations of the practical and striving core of the personality,\r\nwhere, if persistently indulged in, they exacerbate the disturbance\r\nof which they are the sign, interfering with action and eventually\r\nendangering the health and happiness of the individual; while in music,\r\nbeing induced from the outside by mere sounds, they have no ground\r\nwithin the personality itself where they can take root, and hence exert\r\nonly a harmless and transient effect upon the mind; they belong to the\r\nsurface, not to the substance of the self, to imagination, not to the\r\nwill. Or when, as sometimes happens, the deeper and perhaps morbid\r\nstrata of the self are reached by the sounds, the feelings which are\r\nawakened from their sleep there, where they might be productive of\r\nevil dreams, find an orderly and welcome release in the sounds--they\r\nare not only aroused, but carried off by the music. This the Greeks\r\nunderstood when they employed music as a healer of the soul and called\r\nthis effect catharsis.\r\n\r\nIf, indeed, music were just a means for the arousal of feelings, it\r\nwould not be a fine art, but an orgy. For, in order to be aesthetic,\r\nfeelings must be not merely stimulated by, but objectified in, the\r\nsense medium, where they can be mastered and known. But the intimacy\r\nof music is not in contradiction with the freedom and objectivity\r\ncharacteristic of all art. For musical feelings, although they are\r\nexperienced as our own, are nevertheless also experienced as the sounds;\r\nin music we live, not as we live ordinarily, within our bodies, but\r\nout there, in a rarer and unpractical medium--tone. And in this new\r\nregion we gain dominion over our feelings, through the order which the\r\nform of the music imposes upon them, and also self-knowledge, because,\r\nin being externalized in the sounds, our feelings become an object for\r\nour reflection and understanding. In music the light of reflection is\r\nturned straight upon ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe poignancy of music depends upon just this fact that through it we\r\nget a revelation of ourselves to ourselves. In the other arts, this\r\nrevelation is indirect, occurring through the representation of the\r\nlives of other, real or fictitious, personalities; but in music, it\r\nis direct; for there the object of expression is oneself. Even in the\r\nlyric poem, where the reader and the poet tend to become identical,\r\nthe unity is less complete; for when embodied in words, feelings become\r\nmore exterior than when put forth into tones; a tone is closer to the\r\nself, because like a cry or a laugh, it is less articulate. Moreover,\r\nwords are means of communication as well as expression; they therefore\r\nembody of any experience only as much as can be passed from speaker\r\nto hearer; the unique is for the most part lost on the way; but in\r\nmusic the full personal resonance of experience is retained. In music\r\nwe get so close to ourselves that at times it is almost frightening.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the reason why, on all the high or serious occasions of\r\nhuman life, music is alone adequate to express its inner meaning. At\r\na marriage or a funeral, in church or at a festival, the ceremonial\r\nis traditional and social; it expresses the historical and group\r\nsignificance of the situation, but not that which is unique and just\r\none's own; it always contains, moreover, much that is outgrown and\r\nunacceptable--a creed of life or love or death that belongs to the\r\npast, not to us. But the music embodies all that we really believe and\r\nfeel about the fact, its intimate, emotional essence, clear of\r\neverything irrelevant and external.\r\n\r\nBut music does more than express the inexpressible in ourselves; it\r\ngives us entrance into a supernatural world of feeling. Except at the\r\nrare high moments of our lives, its joys and despairs are too exalted\r\nfor us; they are not ours; they belong to gods and heroes. In music\r\nthe superman is born into our feelings. Music does for the emotions\r\nwhat mythology and poetry do for the imagination and philosophy for\r\nthe intellect--it brings us into touch with a more magnificent life,\r\nfor which we have perhaps the potency, but not the opportunity here.\r\nAnd in doing this, music performs a great service; for, outside of\r\nlove and war, life, which offers endless occasions for intense thought\r\nand action, provides few for passionate feeling.\r\n\r\nThus far our study of the art has been confined to so-called absolute\r\nmusic. We must now complete our survey by a rapid consideration of the\r\nunion of music with the other arts. Because of its abstractness, music,\r\nof all the arts, lends itself most readily to combination with others;\r\nyet even in the case of music the possibility of union is limited by\r\nthe existence of a clear identity between the arts combined. Thus,\r\nmusic goes well with the temporal arts, poetry, the dance, and the\r\ndrama, and particularly well with the first two because they are\r\nrhythmical; it will also unite with architecture, because that is\r\nanother abstract art; but with the static, concrete arts like painting\r\nand sculpture, it will not fuse. One might perhaps accompany a picture\r\nwith a single chord whose emotional meaning was the same as that of\r\nthe color scheme and the objects represented, but not with more; for\r\nthe aesthetic experience of the picture is instantaneous and complete,\r\nwhile that of the music requires time for its development and fruition;\r\nhence the two would soon fall apart, and a person would either have\r\nto ignore the music or cease to look at the picture.\r\n\r\nOriginally, of course, music was always combined with some other art,\r\nand first of all, probably with the dance. In its earliest form, the\r\ndance was a communal religious expression, about which we shall have\r\nlittle to say, since it belongs to the past, not to living art. For\r\nto-day the dance is a free art like music. The beauty of the dance\r\nconsists, first, in the free and rhythmical expression of impulses to\r\nmovement. This expression, which is direct for the dancer who actually\r\ncarries out her impulses in real motion, is for the spectator indirect\r\nand ideal, for he experiences only movement-images aroused by movements\r\nseen, and then, by feeling these into the limbs of the dancer, dances\r\nwith her in the imagination. And to secure this free and large, even\r\nthough vicarious, expression of pent-up impulses to movement is very\r\ngrateful to us whose whole movement life is impoverished, because\r\nrestricted by convention and occupation to a few narrow types. But the\r\ndance would have little interest for men were it not for another element\r\nin its beauty: the expression of the amorous feelings of the spectator.\r\nThese, although really located in the breast of the spectator, are\r\nnevertheless embodied in the personality of the dancer, whose charm\r\nthey constitute. Finally, the content of the dance may be further\r\nenriched through the use of symbolic costume and mimetic gestures,\r\nsuggesting emotions like joy or love or grief, emotionally toned ideas\r\nlike spring, or actions such as courtship. Now music, with its own\r\nrhythmical order and voluminous emotional content, has an obvious\r\nkinship with the rhythmic form and amorous substance of the dance, and\r\nso can well serve to accompany it.\r\n\r\nThe result of the union is to enforce the rhythmic experience through\r\nthe medium of sound, the dance keeping time with the music, and, through\r\nthe heightened emotional tone and increased suggestibility created by\r\nthe music, to deepen the sympathetic rapport between dancer and\r\nspectator. Thus the music is given a concrete interpretation through\r\nthe dance, and the dance gains in emotional power through the music.\r\nIn the union, the gain to the dance is clear and absolute; but the\r\nmusic pays a price for the concreteness of content which it secures,\r\nby forfeiting its power to express chance inner moods--what it gains\r\nin definiteness it loses in scope and universality. And only music\r\nwith a strong and evident rhythm is capable of union with the dance;\r\nthe more complex and subtle music, aside from the impossibility of\r\nmaking its delicate rhythms fit into those of a dance, has a variety\r\nand sublimity of meaning so far transcending the personality of any\r\nhuman being, that to attempt to focus it in a dancer, no matter how\r\ncharming, would be a travesty.\r\n\r\nOf equal naturalness and almost equal antiquity with the union of music\r\nwith the dance, is its union with poetry. In song this union is a real\r\nfusion; for the tones are the vocal word-sounds themselves, purified\r\ninto music. Here, of course, unlike absolute music, the tones are\r\nexpressive, not only as other tones are through their mere sound, but\r\nalso through their meaning. And this can well be; for as Schopenhauer\r\nremarked, just as the universal may be illustrated by any object which\r\nembodies it, so the vague musical content of a tone may be fused with\r\nthe concrete meaning of a word of like feeling. And for many hearers\r\nmusic doubtless gains by thus becoming articulate; for, being unable\r\nto supply out of their own imagination the concreteness which music\r\nlacks, they welcome having this done for them by the poet; yet the\r\ngain is not without a corresponding loss. For when the musical meaning\r\nis specialized through the emotions that are the burden of the song,\r\nit necessarily loses the power which it would otherwise have of\r\nexpressing one's own inner life--once more, what it gains in\r\ndefiniteness it loses in scope. It no longer possesses the unique\r\nfunction of the musical. Hence, if we love the music, we shall not\r\ncare whether or not we understand the meaning of the words, and what\r\nwe shall value in the song will be only the peculiar intimacy which\r\nit derives from its instrument, the voice. Only rarely is it otherwise,\r\nas in some of the songs of Schumann, when the poetic interpretation\r\nis so beautiful and so completely at one with the musical feeling,\r\nthat we prefer to accept it rather than substitute our own\r\ninterpretation for the poet's. But even so, the music, if genuine,\r\nwill have value without the words. At the opposite pole are those\r\nsongs, often popular, where the music, having little worth in itself,\r\nis a mere accompaniment for the words. In all cases, however, the music\r\ncan lend to the poetry some of the intimacy which is its own, so that\r\nits burden has a deeper echo in the soul.\r\n\r\nYet much of poetry is unfit for union with music. This is true, first,\r\nof all highly intellectual poetry, where the emotions are embodied in\r\ncomplex and abstract ideas. One could not, for example, readily set\r\nBrowning to music. Music may be deep, mystic, even metaphysical in its\r\nmeaning, but it cannot be dialectical. The emotions that accompany\r\nsubtle thought, even when intense, are not of the voluminous, massive\r\nkind which music expresses; they lack the bodily resonance of the\r\nlatter; they are, moreover, clean-cut and static, while in music\r\neverything flows in half-lights, like a river moving in moonlight.\r\nOn the other hand, poems which express rapidly developing states of\r\nmind, which contain quick, subtle transitions, are equally unfit for\r\nunion with music. For music, although always in motion, is always in\r\nslow motion; it needs time to get under way, and time for its\r\ndevelopment in embroidering, varying, and repeating its theme. And\r\nthis difficulty applies in a general way to every union between poetry\r\nand music. For words are primarily practical and communicative, and\r\ntherefore cut short the passion which they express; whereas tones,\r\nnever having had any other purpose than expression, draw it out and\r\nlet it have its way. Moreover, poetry, because of its definiteness,\r\nis compatible with only a limited range of variation, beyond which it\r\nbecomes monotonous, while music, because of its abstractness, permits\r\nof variations almost endless, and is enriched by every new shape in\r\nwhich its meaning can appear. If, therefore, poetry is to keep time\r\nwith the slow movement of the music and conform to its mode of\r\ndevelopment, the verses have to be repeated again and again; but this\r\ndestroys the poetic form--as in the oratorio, with its senseless\r\niterations.\r\n\r\nFinally, the temporal and developmental character of the drama would\r\nseem to fit it for union with music. Yet the union of these two arts\r\nis confronted with the same difficulties that beset the connection\r\nbetween poetry and music. The movement of the acting drama is swift\r\nand straight, that of music is slow and circular; hence if the music\r\nis to have its way, the action of the drama must stand. In consequence\r\nof this, there is little real action in most operas, prolonged dialogues\r\nin song taking its place. Only rarely--as for example in Strauss'\r\n\"Salome,\" perhaps--is the form of the drama preserved. As a rule the\r\nunity of the musical form is also destroyed, the thread of the story\r\nbeing substituted for it. Last, as in the song, the universality of\r\nthe music is renounced in favor of the interpretation given to it by\r\nthe program. In the _leit-motif_, indeed, as Wagner uses it, where\r\na musical phrase is provided with a fixed connotation of ideas and\r\nacts which is understood by the hearer whenever it recurs, opera ceases\r\nto be music at all in the strict sense, and becomes a musical language.\r\nYet in the opera, as in the song, the music, when genuine, possesses\r\nits own independent meaning, which can be appreciated without the\r\n_mise en scene_ or the program. And then only rarely, as in the\r\nToreador song in \"Carmen,\" is the action so close to the inner meaning\r\nof the music, that the latter seems to gain by the interpretation.\r\n\r\nIt follows that Wagner's dream of making the opera a sum of all the\r\nvalues of poetry, drama, and music, and so an art more beautiful than\r\nany one of them, is fallacious. For, as we have repeatedly seen, in\r\nuniting the arts, there is gain as well as loss; something of the form\r\nor meaning of each has to be sacrificed. The work that results from\r\nthe combination is really a new art-form, in which the elements are\r\nchanged and their individuality partly destroyed; and its value is a\r\nnew value, which may be equal to, but is certainly no greater than,\r\nthat of any other art-form. To put the matter epigrammatically, when\r\nthe arts are added together, one plus one does not equal two, but only\r\none again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE AESTHETICS OF POETRY\r\n\r\n\r\nOur study of music in the preceding chapter has prepared us for the\r\nstudy of poetry, for the two arts are akin. Both are arts of sound and\r\nboth employ rhythm as a principle of order in sound. They had a twin\r\nbirth in song, and although they have grown far apart, they come\r\ntogether again in song. In many ways, music is the standard for verse.\r\nYet, despite these resemblances, the differences between the arts are\r\nstriking. In place of music's disembodied feelings, poetry offers us\r\nconcrete intuitions of life,--the rehearsal of emotions attached to\r\nreal things and clean-cut ideas. Poetry is a music with a definite\r\nmeaning, and that is no music at all. Much of poetry, gnomic and\r\nnarrative, probably grew out of speech by regularizing its natural\r\nrhythm, independent of music. To-day poetry is written to be read, not\r\nto be sung; it is an art of speech, not of song.\r\n\r\nAll speech is communication, an utterance from a speaker to a hearer.\r\nIn the case of ordinary speech, the aim is to effect some change of\r\nmind in the interlocutor that will lead to an action beneficial to one\r\nor both of the persons concerned. Ordinary speech is practical; its\r\nend is to influence conduct; it is command, exhortation, prayer, or\r\nthreat. Poetry, on the other hand, is \"the spontaneous overflow of\r\npowerful feelings\"; its purpose is to express life for the sake of the\r\nvalues which expression itself may create, and to communicate them to\r\nothers. [Footnote: Compare F. N. Scott, \"The Most Fundamental\r\nDifferentia of Poetry and Prose,\" in _Modern Language Association\r\nPublications_, V. 19, pp. 250-269.] The values are given _in the\r\nutterance itself_; they do not have to be waited for to come from\r\nsomething which may develop subsequently. They are the universal\r\naesthetic values which may result from any free expression of life--the\r\ncontemplative reliving of its joys, or the mastery of its pains through\r\nthe courageous facing of them in reflection.\r\n\r\nSince the appeal of poetry is to the sympathy and thoughtfulness which\r\nall men possess, there is no need that it be directed, as ordinary\r\nspeech is, to particular men and women whose help or advantage is\r\nsought. The poet addresses himself to man in general, and only so to\r\nyou and me. Even when ostensibly directed to some particular person,\r\na poem has an audience which is really universal. Except in the first\r\nmoment of creative fervor, the friend invoked is never intended to be\r\nthe sole recipient of the poet's words. Oftentimes the poet appeals\r\nto the dead or to natural objects which cannot hear him. One might\r\nperhaps infer from this that there is no genuine impulse to\r\ncommunication in poetry; that it is pure expression, a dialogue with\r\nself. But this would be a false inference; for there is always some\r\nhint in every poem that a vague background of possible auditors is\r\nbespoken. No matter how intimate and spontaneous, no poem can escape\r\nbeing social, and hence, in varying degrees, self-conscious. Art is\r\nautonomous expression meant to be contagious.\r\n\r\nThe appeal of scientific expression is also to something universal in\r\nmen--to their love of knowledge and understanding. But there is this\r\ndifference between poetry and science: science seeks merely the\r\nintellectual mastery of things and ideas, and so is careless of their\r\nvalues; while poetry, even when descriptive or thoughtful, ever has\r\n_life_ as its theme--the way man reacts to his environment and his\r\nthought. Poetry is never purely descriptive or dialectical. And this\r\ndifference in the substance of the expression determines a difference\r\nin the direction of interest within the expression. In scientific\r\nexpression, words lead us away to things--pure description, or to their\r\nmeanings--mathematics and dialectic; but in poetry, since the values\r\nwhich we attach to things and ideas come from within out of ourselves\r\nand are embodied in the words, they keep us to themselves; we dwell\r\nin the expression itself, in the verbal experience--its total content\r\nof sounds which we hear, ideas which we understand, and feelings which\r\nwe appreciate, is of worth to us.\r\n\r\nSince poetry is an art of speech, we can understand it only through\r\na study of words, which are its media. A single word is seldom an\r\nintegral element of speech; yet it may fairly be called the atom, the\r\nultimate constituent of speech. Now a word is a structure of a\r\npotentially fourfold complexity. First, it is a phenomenon of sound\r\nand movement--something heard and uttered. Its sound, and the\r\nmovement-sensations from vocal cords and tongue and lips which accompany\r\nits production, are the sensuous shell of the word. Second, embodied\r\nin this as the speaker utters it, associated to it as the hearer\r\nunderstands it, is its meaning. The meaning is either an idea of a\r\nconcrete thing or situation, or an abstraction. This is the irreducible\r\nminimum of a word, but is seldom all. For, in poetry, some emotional\r\nresponse to the object meant by the word impels to its utterance, and\r\nthis is embodied in it when it is uttered, and a similar feeling is\r\nawakened in the auditor when it is heard or read. A word not only\r\nmirrors a situation through its meaning, but preserves something of\r\nthe mind's response; it communicates the total experience,--the self\r\nas well as the object. Finally, the meaning of a word may not remain\r\na mere idea, but may grow out into one or more of the concrete images\r\nof which it is the residuum. When, for example, I utter the word\r\n\"ocean,\" I may not only know what I mean and re-experience my joy in\r\nthe sea, but my meaning may be clothed in images of the sight and touch\r\nand odor of the sea--vicariously, through these images, all my sense\r\nexperiences of the sea may be present in the mind. A word, therefore,\r\nsounds and is articulated, means, expresses feeling, and evokes images.\r\nAll understanding of poetry depends upon the knowledge and proper\r\nevaluation of the functioning of these aspects of a word. Let us\r\nconsider in a general way each one of them.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary speech, the sound and articulation of a word, although\r\nindispensable to utterance, and therefore a necessary part of it, are\r\nof little or no value in themselves; for our interest is centered upon\r\nthe meaning or upon the action which is expected to result from its\r\nunderstanding. We do not attend to the quality and rhythm of the word-\r\nsounds which we utter or hear, and the articulatory sensations, although\r\nfelt, have only a shadowy existence in \"the fringe of inattention.\"\r\nBut in poetry, which is speech made beautiful, the mere sound of the\r\nwords has value. In hearing poetry, we not only understand, but listen;\r\nwe appreciate not only the ideas and emotions conveyed, but the\r\nword-sounds and their rhythms as well. Even in silent reading, poetry\r\nis a voice which we delight to hear. [Footnote: And for many this\r\n\"inner speech\" consists quite as much of articulation as of sound. The\r\n\"sound\" of a word is really a complex of actual sounds plus associated\r\narticulation impulses. Throughout the remainder of this chapter, when\r\nI refer to the sound of words, I shall have in mind this entire complex.\r\nWe may therefore say that in silent reading poetry is a voice which\r\nwe delight both to hear and to use.]\r\n\r\nYet, despite the importance which sound acquires in poetry, it never\r\nachieves first place; it never becomes independent, as in music; but\r\nshares hegemony with the other aspects of the word. In practical or\r\nscientific speech, the chief aspect is meaning; for it is the meaning\r\nwhich gives us knowledge and guides our acts. Indeed, for all practical\r\npurposes, the meaning of words consists in the actions which are to\r\nbe performed on hearing them. If I ask a man the way and he tells me,\r\nthe quality of his voice, the interest which he takes in telling me,\r\nand the images which float across his mind are of no importance to me,\r\nso long as I can follow his directions. But in poetry the situation\r\nalters once more. For there, since expression itself has become the\r\nend, and all action upon it is inhibited, the feeling which prompts\r\nit becomes a significant part of what I appreciate. In poetry the\r\nmeanings are secondary to emotions. Yet the meanings are still\r\nindispensable; for they indicate the concrete objects or ideas towards\r\nwhich emotion is directed. In ordinary speech, meanings are guides to\r\naction; in aesthetic speech, they are formulations of feelings. And\r\njust in this power of a word to fixate emotion lies the chief difference\r\nbetween poetry and music, where feeling, being aroused by sound alone,\r\nis vague and objectless.\r\n\r\nIdeally, every word in a poem should be charged with feeling; but\r\nactually this is not the case, for many words, taken by themselves,\r\nare too abstract or commonplace to possess any. Words all too familiar,\r\nor connectives, like \"and\" and \"but\" and \"or,\" are examples of this;\r\nthe former may be avoided by the poet, but the latter are indispensable.\r\nOriginally, no doubt, every word had an emotional coloring, if only\r\nthat of a child's curiosity; and some words have meanings too deeply\r\nrooted in feeling ever to lose it. No amount of familiarity can deprive\r\nsuch words as \"death\" and \"love\" and \"God\" of their emotional value.\r\nWords like these must forever recur in the vocabulary of poets. Yet,\r\nsince in living discourse a meaning is seldom complete in a single\r\nword, but requires several words in a phrase or sentence, a word which\r\nby itself would be cold may participate in the general warmth of the\r\nwhole of which it is a part. Consider, for example, the last line of\r\nthe final stanza of Wordsworth's \"The Lost Love\":--\r\n\r\n  She lived unknown, and few could know\r\n     When Lucy ceased to be;\r\n  But she is in her grave, and O!\r\n     The difference to me!\r\n\r\nThe first three words, by themselves, are completely bare of emotional\r\ncoloring, yet, taken together with the last, and in connection with\r\nthe whole stanza, and in the setting of the entire poem, they are aglow\r\nwith the most poignant passion.\r\n\r\nAs for the image, the last of the aspects of a word, the judgment of\r\nEdmund Burke, in his \"Essay on the Sublime and Beautiful\" still remains\r\ntrue: in reading words or in listening to them, we get the sound and\r\nthe meaning and their \"impressions\" (emotions), but the images which\r\nfloat across the mind, if there are any, are often too vague or too\r\ninconstant to be of much relevance to the experience. They are,\r\nmoreover, highly individual in nature, differing in kind and clearness\r\nfrom person to person. The recent researches into imageless thinking\r\nare a striking confirmation of Burke's observation. It is now pretty\r\nclearly established that the meaning of words is something more than\r\nthe images, visual or other, which they arouse. Probably the meaning\r\nis always carried by some sort of imagery, differing with the mental\r\nmake-up of the reader, but the meaning cannot be equated to the imagery.\r\nFor example, you and I both understand the word \"ocean\"; but when I\r\nread the word, I get a visual image of green water and sunlight, while\r\nyou perhaps get an auditory image of the sound of the waves as they\r\nbreak upon the shore. Sound, meaning, feeling, these are the essential\r\nconstituents of discourse; imagery is variable and accidental. It is\r\nimpossible, therefore, to found the theory of poetry on the image-making\r\npower of words. [Footnote: For the opposite view, consult Max Eastman:\r\n_The Enjoyment of Poetry._] And yet, imagery plays a primary role\r\nin poetic speech. For, as we have observed so often, feelings are more\r\nvital and permanent when embedded in concrete sensations and images\r\nthan when attached to abstract meanings. Through the image, the poet\r\nconfers upon his art some of the sensuousness which it would otherwise\r\nlack. It is not necessary that the image appear clear in the mind; for\r\nits emotional value can be conveyed even when it is obscure and\r\nmarginal. When, for example, we read,\r\n\r\n  Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,\r\n  Thou dost not bite so nigh\r\n  As benefits forgot,\r\n\r\nthe word \"bitter\" may arouse no vivid gustatory image, the word \"bite\"\r\nno clear image of pain; yet even when these images are very dim, they\r\nserve none the less to establish the feeling of intense disagreeableness\r\nwhich the poet wishes to convey. Poetry, therefore, because it is more\r\nemotional than ordinary speech, is more abundantly imaginal.\r\n\r\nHaving distinguished in a general way the four elements of\r\nspeech--sound, meaning, feeling, and imagery--we are prepared to study\r\nthem singly in greater detail. We want to build out of a study of these\r\nelements a synthetic view of the nature and function of poetry, and\r\napply our results to some of its newer and more clamant forms. Let us\r\nbegin with sound. In our first chapter we observed that the medium of\r\nan art tends to become expressive in itself,--that in poetry the mere\r\nsound and articulation of words, quite apart from anything which they\r\nmean, may arouse and communicate feelings. What we have called the\r\nprimary expressiveness of the medium is nowhere better illustrated\r\nthan in poetry. But just what is expressed through sound, and how?\r\n\r\nEvery lover of poetry is aware of the large share which the mere sound\r\nof the words contributes to its beauty. This is true even when we\r\nabstract from rhythm, which we shall neglect for the time being, and\r\nthink only of euphony, alliteration, assonance, and rime. There is a\r\njoy truly surprising in the mere repetition of vowels and consonants.\r\nFor myself, I find a pleasure in the mere repetition of vowels and\r\nconsonants all out of proportion to what, a priori, I should be led\r\nto expect from so slight a cause. And yet we have the familiar analogies\r\nby means of which we can understand this seemingly so strange delight,\r\nthe repeat in a pattern, consonance in chord and melody. If the\r\nrepetition of the same color or line in painting, the same tone in\r\nmusic, can delight us, why not the repetition of the same word-sound?\r\nIn all cases a like feeling of harmony is produced. And the same general\r\nprinciple applies to explain it. All word-sounds as we utter or hear\r\nthem leave memory traces in the mind, which are not pure images (no\r\nmemory traces are), but also motor sets, tendencies or impulses to the\r\nremaking of the sounds. The doing of any deed--a word is also a\r\ndeed--creates a will to its doing again; hence the satisfaction when\r\nthat will is fulfilled in the repeated sound, when the image melts\r\nwith the fact. And the same law that rules in music and design holds\r\nhere also: there must not be too much of consonance, of repetition,\r\nelse the will becomes satiated and fatigued; there must be difference\r\nas well as identity,--the novelty and surprise which accompany the\r\narousal of a still fresh and unappeased impulse. This is well provided\r\nfor in alternate rimes, where the will to one kind of sound is suspended\r\nby the emergence of a different sound with its will, and where the\r\nfulfillment of the one balances the fulfillment of the other. All these\r\nfacts are illustrated in such a stanza as this:--\r\n\r\n  Fear no more the heat o' the sun\r\n    Nor the furious winter's rages;\r\n   Thou thy worldly task hast done,\r\n    Home art gone and ta'en thy wages;\r\n   Golden lads and girls all must,\r\n    As chimney sweepers, come to dust.\r\n\r\nHere, for example, the \"f\"-sound in \"fear\" finds harmonious fulfillment\r\nin \"furious\"; the \"t\"-sound in \"task,\" its mate in \"ta'en\"; the\r\n\"g\"-sound in \"golden,\" its match in \"girls\"; \"sun\" and \"done,\" \"rages\"\r\nand \"wages,\" illustrate a balance of harmonies; while in the consonance\r\nof \"must\" and \"dust,\" the whole movement of the stanza comes to full\r\nand finished harmony.\r\n\r\nThus taken together, word-sounds, as mere sounds, are expressive of\r\nthe general form-feelings of harmony and balance. But can they express\r\nanything singly? Is there anything in poetry comparable to the\r\nexpressiveness of single tones or of colors like red and blue and\r\nyellow? To this, I think, the answer must be, little or nothing. Almost\r\nall the expressiveness of single words comes from their meaning. At\r\nall events, the sound and meaning of a word are so inextricably fused\r\nthat, even when we suspect that it may have some expressiveness on its\r\nown account, we are nearly incapable of disentangling it. As William\r\nJames has remarked, a word-sound, when taken by itself apart from its\r\nmeaning, gives an impression of mere queerness. And when it does seem\r\nto have some distinctive quality, we do not know how much really belongs\r\nto the sound and how much to some lingering bit of meaning which we\r\nhave failed to separate in our analysis. For example, because of its\r\ninitial \"s\"-sound and its hard consonants, the word \"struggle\" seems\r\nto express, in the effort required to pronounce it, something of the\r\nemotional tone of struggle itself; but how do we know that this is not\r\ndue to the association with its meaning, which we have been unable to\r\nabstract from? Even true onomatopoetic words like \"bang\" or \"crack\"\r\nderive, I suspect, most of their specific quality from their meaning.\r\nThey do have, to be sure, a certain mimetic impressiveness as mere\r\nsounds; but that is very vague; the meaning makes it specific. The\r\nsheer length of the word \"multitudinous\" in Shakespeare's line, \"the\r\nmultitudinous seas incarnadine,\" seems to express something of the\r\nvastness and prolixity of the seas; but would it if it were not used\r\nas an adjective describing the seas, and if it did not have just the\r\nmeaning that it has? Of course, in this case, the mere sound is\r\neffective, but it gets most of its effectiveness because it happens\r\nto have a certain meaning. Moreover, even the very sound quality of\r\nwords depends much upon their meaning; we pronounce them in a certain\r\nway, with a certain slowness or swiftness, a certain emphasis upon\r\nparticular syllables, with a high or low intonation, in accordance\r\nwith the emotion which we feel into them. This is true of the word\r\n\"struggle\" just cited. Or consider another example. Take the word\r\n\"blow.\" Who, in reading this word in \"Blow, blow, thou winter wind,\"\r\nwould not increase its explosiveness just in order to make its\r\nexpressiveness correspond to its meaning?\r\n\r\nThere is, therefore, a fundamental difference in this respect between\r\nsingle word-sounds and single colors or tones; they are not sufficiently\r\nimpressive in themselves, not sufficiently separable from their\r\nmeanings, to have anything except the slightest value as mere sounds.\r\nIn collocation, however, and quite apart from rhythm and alliteration,\r\nthis minute expressiveness may add up to a considerable amount. In\r\nMatthew Arnold's lines,\r\n\r\n  Swept by confused alarms of struggle and flight\r\n  Where ignorant armies crash by night,\r\n\r\nthe hardness and difficulty of the consonants in their cumulative force\r\nbecome an independent element of expressiveness, strengthening that\r\nof the meaning of the words. Or in Tennyson's oft-quoted line, \"the\r\nmurmuring of innumerable bees,\" the sounds taken together have a genuine\r\nimitative effect, in which something of the drowsy feeling of the hive\r\nis present.\r\n\r\nFollowing the general law of harmony between form and content, the\r\nbeauty of sound should be functional; that is, it should never be\r\ndeveloped for its own sake alone, but also to intensify, through\r\nre-expression, the mood of the thoughts. The sound-values are too\r\nlacking in independence to be purely ornamental. Poetry does indeed\r\npermit of embellishment--the pleasurable elaboration of sensation--yet\r\nshould never degenerate into a mere tintinnabulation of sounds. The\r\nrimes in binding words should bind thoughts also; the tonalities or\r\ncontrasts of vowel and consonant should echo harmonies or strains in\r\npervasive moods.\r\n\r\nIt is by rhythm, however, that the chief expressiveness of the mere\r\nmedium is imparted to verse. But here again we shall find sound and\r\nmeaning intertwined--a rhythm in thought governing a rhythm in sound.\r\n\r\nOnly as a result of recent investigations can a satisfactory theory\r\nof modern verse be constructed. The making of this theory has been\r\nlargely hampered, on the one hand, by the application of the\r\nquantitative principles of classical verse to our poetry; and, on the\r\nother hand, by forcing the analogy between music and verse. The\r\ninsufficiency of the quantitative scheme for English verse is not\r\ndifficult to perceive. Such a scheme presupposes that syllables have\r\na fixed quantity of duration, as either long or short, and that rhythm\r\nconsists in the regularity of their distribution. But, although there\r\nare differences in the duration of syllables, some being longer than\r\nothers, there are no fixed rules to determine whether a syllable is\r\nshort or long; and, what is a more serious objection, it is impossible\r\nto find any regularity in the occurrence of shorts and longs in normal\r\nEnglish verse,--in all verse that has not been written with the explicit\r\npurpose of imitating the Greek or Latin. An examination of any line\r\nof verse will verify these statements. Take, for example, the first\r\nthree lines of Shakespeare's song,\r\n\r\n  Blow, blow, thou winter wind,\r\n  Thou art not so unkind\r\n     As man's ingratitude.\r\n\r\nHere the quantitative scansion is perhaps as follows:--\r\n\r\n  - - - - U -\r\n  - - U x U -\r\n  U - U - U -\r\n\r\nI have given the word \"so\" a double scansion because I conceive it\r\nimpossible to determine whether it is really long or short. At any\r\nrate, there is certainly no regularity in the distribution of shorts\r\nand longs, except in the last of the three lines, and no correspondence,\r\nexcept in that line, between the quantitative scansion and the\r\nrhythmical movement of the verses. And whenever such a correspondence\r\nexists, it is due either to the fact that the incidence of stress tends\r\nto lengthen a syllable or to the fact that, oftentimes, in polysyllabic\r\nwords, mere length will produce a stress. This is the modicum of truth\r\nin the quantitative view. But obviously stress governs, quantity obeys.\r\n\r\nAlthough the quantitative theory of modern verse has been pretty\r\ngenerally abandoned, it cannot be said that the ordinary view which\r\nregards the foot as the unit of verse and its rhythm as determined by\r\na regular distribution of accented and unaccented syllables, is in a\r\nmuch better case. For in the first place, by accent is usually meant\r\nword-accent; but monosyllabic words have no word-accent; hence, in\r\na succession of such syllables, the accent must be determined by some\r\nother factor; and, granting this, there is the further fact to be\r\nreckoned with, that poetic accent is relative--the supposedly unaccented\r\nsyllable is often very highly accented, more highly in fact than some\r\nof the so-called accented ones. Consider, for example, the line, \"From\r\nsullen earth sings hymns at heaven's gate,\" where the word \"sings,\"\r\nwhich in accordance with the conventional iambic scansion would be an\r\nunaccented syllable, is really strongly accented, more strongly, indeed,\r\nthan \"earth\" which has an accent. As for the division of the line into\r\nfeet, that is a pure artifice: who, in the actual reading of the above\r\nline, would divide the words \"sullen\" and \"heaven\" into two parts?\r\n\r\nThe basis of rhythm is, therefore, not word-accent. Value stress is\r\nthe basis.[Footnote: Throughout the discussion of rhythm I borrow from\r\nMark H. Liddell: _An Introduction to the Study of Poetry._] Certain\r\nwords, because of their logical or emotional importance, have a greater\r\nclaim upon the attention, and this inner stress finds outward expression\r\nin an increased loudness, duration, and explosiveness of sound. Stress\r\ncoincides with the word-accent of polysyllabic words because the accent\r\nis placed on those syllables, usually the root-syllables, which carry\r\nthe essential meaning. And this stress is not simply present or absent\r\nin a syllable, but greater in some than in others; in iambic rhythm,\r\nusually greater in the even than in the preceding odd syllable; in\r\ntrochaic, greater in the odd than in the immediately preceding even\r\none. The rhythm is rather an undulation of stresses than an alternation\r\nof stress and lack of stress, something, therefore, far more complex\r\nand variegated than the old scheme would imply. And of this undulation,\r\nnot the foot, but the line is the unit. The character of the undulation\r\nof the whole line determines the type of the rhythm, which may be very\r\ndifferent in the case of lines of precisely the same kind of \"feet.\"\r\nFor example, the line quoted above, \"From sullen earth sings hymns at\r\nheaven's gate,\" has a distinctly different rhythm from such another\r\niambic line as \"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?\" This difference\r\nis due, in part at least, to the fact that the highest peaks of the\r\nwave in the former are in the center of the line, in \"sings\" and\r\n\"hymns,\" while in the latter they are at the end, in \"summer's\" and\r\n\"day.\" This undulation of stress is present in prose and in ordinary\r\nspeech; for there also there is a rise and fall of stress corresponding\r\nto the varying values of the words and syllables; but in prose, the\r\nundulation is irregular, while in poetry, it is regularized.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing it is clear that rhythm does not exist in the mere\r\nsound of the words alone, but in the thought back of them as well. The\r\nsounds, as such, have no rhythm in themselves; they acquire rhythm\r\nthrough the subjective processes of significant utterance or listening.\r\nThe rhythm is primarily in these activities, and from them is\r\ntransferred to the sounds in which they are embodied. This comes out\r\nwith additional force when we go farther into the analysis of the\r\nrhythm of verse. We have just seen that the line is one unit of the\r\nrhythm (this is true even when there are run-over lines, because we\r\nmake a slight pause after the ends of such lines too); but within the\r\nline itself there are sub-units. These sub-units are units of thought.\r\nEvery piece of written or spoken language is a continuous flow of\r\nthought. But the movement is not perfectly fluid; for it is broken up\r\ninto elementary pulses of ideas, following discontinuously upon each\r\nother. In prose the succession of pulses is complex and irregular,\r\nwithout any obvious pattern; but in poetry the movement is simple and\r\nregular and the pattern is clear. Just as in poetry there is a rhythm\r\nof stress which represents a regularizing of the natural undulations\r\nin the stress of speech, so there is also a more deep-lying rhythm,\r\nwhich arises through a simplification and regularizing of the movement\r\nof thought-pulsations. The fundamental rhythm consists in an alternation\r\nof subject-group and predicate-group.\r\n\r\nThis duality, although always retained as basal, may, however, be\r\nbroken up into a three- or four-part movement whenever the connecting\r\nlinks between the subject-idea and the predicate-idea acquire sufficient\r\nimportance, or whenever the one or the other of the two becomes\r\nsufficiently complex to consist of lesser parts. For example, in\r\nShakespeare's thirty-first sonnet, the thought-divisions are three for\r\neach of the following lines:--\r\n\r\n  Thy bosom | is endeared | with all hearts\r\n  Which I by lacking | have supposed | dead;\r\n  And there | reigns love, | and all love's loving parts,\r\n  And all those friends | which I thought | buried.\r\n\r\nThese divisions are marked by pauses or casuras.\r\n\r\nHere, then, in the regularizing of the number of thought-pulsations,\r\nwe have another type of rhythm in poetry, and a rhythm which, coming\r\nfrom within, finds outward expression in sound. Cutting across the\r\nrhythm of stress, it breaks up the latter with its pauses, and imparts\r\nto the whole movement variety and richness.\r\n\r\nBut speech has not only its natural rhythm of stress-undulation and\r\nthought-pulsations; it has also, as we saw in the last chapter, a\r\nmelody. The rise and fall of stress goes hand and hand with a rise and\r\nfall of pitch. The different forms of discourse, and the different\r\nemotions that accompany them, are each expressed with characteristic\r\nvariations in pitch. Accepting Wundt's summary of the facts, we find\r\nthat, generally speaking, in the declarative statement and the command,\r\nthe pitch rises in the first thought-division, to fall in the second;\r\nwhile in the question and the condition, the pitch rises and falls in\r\nthe first, and then rises again in the second. Doubt, expectation,\r\ntension, excitement--all the forward looking moods of\r\nincompleteness--tend to find expression in a rising melody; while\r\nassurance, repose, relaxation, fulfillment, are embodied in a falling\r\nmelody. The high tones are dynamic and stimulating; the low tones,\r\nstatic and peaceful. Now in ordinary speech and prose, the change from\r\none tone to another is constant and irregular, following the variation\r\nof mood in the substance of the discourse. How is it with verse? There\r\nis a simplification and tonality--identity in tone--which is absent\r\nfrom prose. The melody is more obvious and distinctive, because there\r\nis a greater simplicity in sentence structure and a higher unity of\r\nmood. Yet there is no absolute regularity; and the amount of it differs\r\nwith the different kinds of poetry: there is more in the simple lyric\r\nthan in the complex narrative; more, for example, in Shakespeare's\r\nsonnets than in his dramas. The inexpressible beauty of some lines of\r\nverse comes doubtless from a fugitive melody which we now grasp, now\r\nlose.\r\n\r\nThe existence of speech melody and the tonalities of rime, assonance,\r\nand alliteration suggest an analogy between verse and music. For some\r\npeople, this analogy is decisive. Yet the fundamental difference between\r\nmusic and verse must be insisted on with equal force; the purity of\r\ntone and fixity of intervals between tones, which is distinctive of\r\nmusic, is absent from verse. In comparison with music, the melodiousness\r\nof verse is confused and chaotic; and this condemns to failure any\r\nattempt to identify the laws of the two arts. Still, we are not yet\r\nat the end of the analogy. Those who interpret verse in terms of music\r\nbelieve that, underlying or supplanting the rhythm of stress, there\r\nis another rhythm, similar to time in music, and capable of expression\r\nin musical language. There is, it is claimed, an equality of duration\r\nbetween one line and another, and between one foot in a line and\r\nanother; these larger and lesser stretches of duration being divided\r\nup between syllables and pauses, each syllable and pause occupying a\r\nfixed quantity of time; just as in music each bar is divided up between\r\nnotes and rests of definite value. Lanier, for example writes the first\r\nline of Poe's \"Raven\" as follows:--[Footnote: The Science of English\r\nVerse, p. 128.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  Once up | on a | mid-night | drear-y;\r\n\r\nFascinating as this procedure is, it is nevertheless a distortion of\r\nthe facts. Poetry is meant to be read, not to be sung; when it is put\r\nto music and sung, it acquires a character which otherwise does not\r\nbelong to it. We must not be misled by the historical connection between\r\nverse and song, nor by the frequency with which some verses are set\r\nto music. Our poetry must be understood as we experience it to-day,\r\nnot as it was experienced in its origins. And there is surely much\r\npoetry which no one wants to sing. No one wants to sing a sonnet or\r\nMiltonic blank verse. The attempt to apply musical notation to verse\r\nis a _tour de force_. Careful observation and experience show that the\r\nsyllables in verse have no fixed duration values, and that there is no\r\nconstant ratio between them.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, musical time is not wholly absent from verse. You cannot\r\nset it to the metronome or express it in musical notation, yet it is\r\nthere. When lines have the same number of syllables, the time required\r\nto read them is approximately the same, and we tend to make the duration\r\nof the thought-divisions equal. Our time-sense is so fallible, we do\r\nnot notice the departures from exactness; and when the durations of\r\nprocesses are nearly equal and the values which we attach to them are\r\nequal, then we are conscious of them as equal. Attention-value and\r\ntime-value are subjectively equivalent. Words which weigh with us give\r\nus pause, and we reckon in the time of the pause to make up for a\r\ndeficiency in the time required to read or utter the syllables. And\r\nso time-rhythm enters as still another factor in the complex rhythm\r\nof verse.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this rhythm differs, however, with the different\r\nkinds of verse. In lyric poetry closely allied to song, it is clear\r\nand strong; while in the more reflective and dramatic poetry, it is\r\nonly an undertone. In some cases, as in the nursery rime,\r\n\r\n  Hot cross buns, hot cross buns,\r\n  If your daughters don't like 'em,\r\n  Give 'em to your sons.\r\n  One a penny, two a penny,\r\n  Hot cross buns,\r\n\r\nthere is almost no rhythm of stress, but there is a rhythm of time;\r\nfor despite the inequality in the number of syllables, each line has\r\napproximately the same duration, even the last line with its three\r\nmonosyllabic words being lengthened out into equality with the others.\r\nThe variety in the rhythm is secured through the unequal number of\r\nsyllables in the same stretch of duration, the more rapid movement of\r\nmany syllables being set off over against the slower movement of the\r\nfew. Similarly, Tennyson's poem, which should be scanned as I shall\r\nindicate, has a rhythm which is chiefly musical.\r\n\r\n  Break, | break, | break,\r\n  On thy cold, | grey stones, | O sea!\r\n  And I would | that my tongue | might utter\r\n  The thoughts | That arise | in me.\r\n\r\nThe stresses are nearly even throughout; the meter cannot be accurately\r\ndescribed as iambic, trochaic, or anapestic; yet there is a rhythm in\r\nthe approximate temporal equality of the thought-moments. These verses\r\nare, however, rather songs than poems. The failure to distinguish\r\nbetween verses which are songs and those which are poems accounts, I\r\nbelieve, for the extremes to which the musical theory of verse has\r\nbeen carried.\r\n\r\nStill another element of poetry which allies it to music is the\r\nrepetition of the thought-content. Why repetition should be musical\r\nwe already know: music is an art which seeks to draw out and elaborate\r\npure emotion; repetition serves this end by constantly bringing the\r\nmind back to dwell upon the same theme. Moreover, repetition involves\r\nretardation; for a movement cannot progress rapidly if it has to return\r\nupon itself; and this slowness gives time for the full value of a\r\nfeeling to be worked out. In all the more emotional and lyric poetry\r\nwe find, therefore, recurrence of theme: the thought is repeated again\r\nand again; in new forms, perhaps, yet still the same in essence,\r\nsuccessive lines or stanzas taking up the same burden; sometimes there\r\nis exact recurrence of thought, as in the refrain. And this repetition\r\nin the thought is embodied in a repetition of the elements of the\r\nsound-pattern; the wave type is repeated from verse to verse or recurs\r\nagain and again; there is recurrence of melodic form or parallelism\r\nbetween contrasted melodies in different stanzas; there is tonality\r\nof vowel and consonant sounds in rime and assonance and alliteration;\r\nthere may be an approach to identity in the time-duration of the various\r\nunits. Parallelism or repetition is the fundamental scheme of such\r\npoetry. But between repetition with its retardation of movement and\r\nprogress towards a goal there is a necessary antagonism; hence in the\r\nmore dramatic and narrative forms of poetry, although recurrence is\r\nnever entirely absent, there is less of it, and the movement\r\napproximates to that of prose. Emotion demands repetition, but action\r\ndemands progression.\r\n\r\nAfter our analysis of the rhythm of poetry, we are in a position to\r\ninquire into what can be expressed through it, and how psychologically\r\nthis expression can be explained.\r\n\r\nThe expressiveness of rhythm is like that of music, vague and\r\nobjectless, for which reason rhythm is properly called the music of\r\nverse. Almost everything in a general way which we have said about the\r\nexpressiveness of music applies to poetic rhythm. This expressiveness\r\ncannot be translated into words with any exactness; the most that can\r\nbe done is to find a set of words into which it will roughly fit,\r\nleaving much vacant space of meaning. That the emotional values of\r\nrhythms have character is, however, proved by the fact that some rhythms\r\nare better vehicles for certain kinds of thought than others are. Yet\r\nit often happens that, just as, in song or opera, the same melody is\r\nused to express joy or grief, love or religious emotion, so\r\napproximately the same rhythmic form is employed in the expression of\r\napparently antagonistic emotions. Nevertheless, this fact is not fatal\r\nto expression; for, in the first place, there is much variety of rhythm\r\nwithin a given metrical form, so that what superficially may seem to\r\nbe the same rhythm is really a different one; and, in the second place,\r\nas we have already observed in the case of music, there is much--in\r\nform and energy of movement--which contrasting emotions have in common,\r\nand this may be expressed in the rhythmic type. Think of the wide sweep\r\nof emotions which have been expressed in the sonnet form! Yet consider\r\nwhat varieties of rhythm and speech melodies are possible within this\r\nform, and how, nevertheless, there is an identity of character in all\r\nsonnets--how they are all thoughtful, all restrained, yet unfaltering\r\nin their movement!\r\n\r\nWithout going into details, which would lie beyond the scope of general\r\nsthetics, it is possible to state the following broad facts (compare\r\nthe similar facts relating to melody) with reference to poetic rhythms:\r\na rising rhythm expresses striving or restlessness; a falling rhythm,\r\nquiet, steadfastness. There is, however, no absolute contrast between\r\nthe two kinds, because a falling rhythm is still a rhythm, and that\r\nmeans a movement which necessarily contains something of instability\r\nand unrest. The contrast is sharpest in the anapestic and dactylic,\r\nless sharp in the trochaic and iambic. Many a trochaic rhythm becomes\r\nin effect iambic when the division of the thought moments and the\r\ndistribution of the pauses make the rhythm rise after the first few\r\nwords; and conversely, many an iambic rhythm becomes trochaic through\r\na similar shift in the attention. Within a single line, therefore,\r\nthere may be both rising and falling pulsations. Much of the rare\r\nbeauty of poetry comes from such subtle combinations of rhythmic\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nThrough time and tempo also, poetic rhythm is expressive, much after\r\nthe manner of music; by these means too, in addition to the mode of\r\nstress-undulation, it imitates the temporal and dynamic course of\r\naction and emotion, and so tends to arouse congruous types of feeling\r\nin the mind; it is swift or slow, gliding or abrupt, retarded or\r\naccelerated. Compare the slow and retarded rhythm of \"When I have fears\r\nthat I may cease to be,\" so well adapted to express the gravity of the\r\nthought, with the rapid and accelerated movement of \"Hail to thee,\r\nblithe spirit!\" so full of a quick joyousness. Or compare the light\r\nlegato movement of \"Bird of the wilderness, blithesome and cumberless,\"\r\nwith the heavy staccato movement of \"Waste endless and boundless and\r\nflowerless.\"\r\n\r\nYet, for all its expressiveness, the music of verse can never stand\r\nalone. It is too bare and tenuous by itself to win and keep the\r\nattention or to evoke much feeling. It does not possess the purity of\r\ncolor, the loudness, force, or volume of sound that belong to music\r\nand make music, almost alone of the arts, capable of existing as mere\r\nform. The rhythm of poetry, derived very largely from a rhythm of\r\nthought, has need of thought for significance. The thought and the\r\nmusic are one. For this reason poetry is better, I think, when read\r\nto oneself than when read aloud; for then the sound and the sense are\r\nmore intimate; the attention is not drawn off to the former away from\r\nthe latter. Moreover, try as he will, the poet can never make his\r\nword-sounds fully harmonious; some roughness and dissonance will remain;\r\nbut in silent reading these qualities disappear. However, although by\r\nitself of small significance, the musical element in verse makes all\r\nthe difference between poetry and prose. Through its own vague\r\nexpressiveness it fortifies the emotional meaning of the poetic\r\nlanguage, and, at the same time, sublimates it by scattering it in the\r\nmedium. And finally it imparts an intimacy, a personal flavor, which\r\nalso allies poetry with music; for the substance of rhythm is the\r\nmovement of our own inner processes; the rhythm of thoughts and sounds\r\nis a rhythm in our own listening and attending, our own thinking and\r\nfeeling; the emotional values spring from us as well as from the\r\nsubject-matter. Hence even narrative and dramatic poetry have a lyrical\r\ntone; we ourselves are implicated in the actions and events portrayed.\r\n\r\nThe demands made by the form of poetry upon its substance are similar\r\nto those made by music upon the words in a song, only less stringent.\r\nThe content must be emotional and significant; it cannot be trite and\r\ncold. The meaning of words would permit the poet to bring before the\r\nmind all possible objects, events, and ideas, but the music of words\r\nwould be incongruous with most of them. Events narrated must be\r\nstirring, thoughts uttered must be emotionally toned, things described\r\nmust be related to human life and action. Poetry may desert the royal\r\nthemes of long ago--_arma virumque cano, maenin aeide thea_--and\r\nrelate the lowly life of common folk, even the sordid life of the poor\r\nand miserable, but when doing so throws over it the musical glamour\r\nof verse and arouses the heat of sympathy and passion. Although, since\r\nit makes use of words, poetry should always have a meaning, it need\r\nnot have the definiteness of meaning of logical thought; it may suggest\r\nrather than explicate; its music is compatible with vagueness. But\r\nvagueness is not obscurity; the poet should always make us feel that\r\nwe understand him; he should not seek to mystify us, or keep us guessing\r\nat his meaning. Yet, since the poet operates with words and not with\r\nmere sounds, great subtlety and precision of thought are possible in\r\npoetry, although not argument and dialectic. Poetry may express the\r\nresults of reflection, so far as they are of high emotional value, but\r\ncannot well reproduce its processes; the steps of analysis and inference\r\nare too cold and hard for the muse to climb.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, poetry does not permit of the development and\r\niteration of pure feeling which we find in music; for poetic rhythms\r\nand melodies lack the variety and fluency of the musical. Yet poetry\r\nis capable, where music is not, of expressing brief, quick outbursts\r\nof feeling; for a few words, by referring to the causes and conditions\r\nof feeling, may adequately express what music needs time and many tones\r\nto convey. Poetry wins beauty by concentration, whereas music gains\r\nby expansion. There is also a similar relation between prose and poetry\r\nin this respect; the severity of the form imposes upon poetry a\r\nsimplicity which contrasts with the breadth and complexity of prose.\r\nAs Schopenhauer remarked, every good poem is short; long poems always\r\ncontain stretches either of unmusical verse or unpoetic music. Yet,\r\nin comparison with prose, the tempo of music is slow; we have to linger\r\nin the medium in order that its rhythmic and tonal beauties may impress\r\nus, and this slowness of movement is imparted to the thought; even\r\nnarrative and dramatic poetry suffer retardation; for which reason the\r\npoetic form must be abandoned if great rapidity of expression is sought.\r\n\r\nFrom our study of the materials and forms of its expression, it becomes\r\nclear how the subject-matter of poetry is the inner life of mood and\r\nstriving and passionate human action. Emotions may be poured forth in\r\nwords, and, by means of words, actions may be described. But neither\r\npassion nor action appear in poetry as they are lived and enacted; for\r\nthe poet, working in a medium of words, has to translate them into\r\nthoughts. Words cannot embody the real experiences which they express;\r\nexperience is fleeting and falls away from the words, which retain\r\nonly an echo of what they mean. Only what can be relived in memory can\r\nbe contained in a word, and not even all of that; for a word is not\r\na mere embodiment of an experience, but a communication also, and only\r\nits public and universal content can pass from a speaker to a hearer.\r\nNow, this socialized content of a word is a thought. Even passion the\r\nmost spontaneous and lyrical has to be translated into thought,--not\r\nthe abstract thought of scientific expression, but the emotionally\r\ntoned thought of art, thought which, while condensing experience, still\r\nkeeps its values. Emotional thought is the substance of poetry. However,\r\nalbeit an image of the inner life, poetry does not volatilize it into\r\npure feeling as music does, but distinguishes its objects and assigns\r\nits causes. Poetry is concrete and articulate where music is abstract\r\nand blind. Since words, through their meanings and associated images,\r\ncan express things as well as man's reactions to them, poetry can also\r\nreflect the natural environment of life, its habitat and seat. And\r\nyet, because the poet has to translate things into ideas, nature never\r\nappears in poetry as it is in itself, but as it is implicated in mind.\r\nFor the poet, sea and sky, the woods and plains and rivers, birds and\r\nflowers, are the symbols of human destiny or the loci of human action.\r\nEmotion overflows into nature, but this involves the taking up of\r\nnature into man. Not nature, but man's thoughtful life is the poet's\r\ntheme.\r\n\r\nIf the foregoing statement is correct, emotional thought rather than\r\nimagery is the substance of poetry. For poetry, as music with a meaning,\r\ncan be quite free of definite images. \"_In la sua volantade e nostra\r\npace_\" (In his will is our peace) [Footnote: Dante: _Paradiso_,\r\n3, 85.] is beautiful poetry, yet there is no image. The thought\r\nformulates a mood and finds a sensuous embodiment in musical language,\r\nand that suffices for beauty. And yet in poetry, as has been observed,\r\nthought tends to descend into imagery. By being connected with a\r\nsensuous material, a thought acquires a firmer support for feeling\r\nthan it could possess of itself as a mere concept. Especially effective\r\nis the descent to the lower senses; for they are closest to the roots\r\nof emotion. Let me recall again the Shakespearean lyric which I have\r\nquoted before in a similar connection, omitting the last lines of each\r\nstanza:--\r\n\r\n  Blow, blow, thou winter wind,\r\n  Thou art not so unkind\r\n   As man's ingratitude;\r\n\r\n  Thy tooth is not so keen\r\n  Because thou art not seen,\r\n   Although thy breath be rude.\r\n\r\n  Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,\r\n  Thou dost not bite so nigh\r\n   As benefits forgot;\r\n\r\n  Though thou the waters warp,\r\n  Thy sting is not so sharp\r\n   As friend remembered not.\r\n\r\nHere are images of cold--winter, freeze; of touch--blow, breath; of\r\npain--tooth, bite, sting, sharp; of taste--bitter. How vividly they\r\nconvey the ache of desolation! Only in words which are imaginative as\r\nwell as musical are the full resources of verbal expression employed.\r\n\r\nAll the various forms of metaphorical language have the same purpose:\r\nby substituting for a more abstract, conceptual mode of expression a\r\nmore sensuous and imaginative one, to vivify the emotional quality of\r\nthe situation. When Keats sings,\r\n\r\n  ... on the shore\r\n  Of the wide world I stand and think\r\n  Till Love and Fame to nothingness do sink,\r\n\r\nhe has in mind to convey to us that renunciation of merely personal\r\nambitions which comes to us when we \"survey all time and all existence.\"\r\nAnd how does he do it? By evoking the image of the wide stretch of the\r\nshore of the sea, which, making us feel our nothingness as we stand\r\nand look out upon it, has the same effect, only more poignant. Of the\r\nworld we have no image--not so, of the shore of the world; and toward\r\nwhat we cannot imagine we cannot easily feel. Oftentimes the metaphor\r\nis latent, a mere adjective undeveloped in its implications, as in\r\n\"bitter\" sky; yet the purpose is the same. Incidentally the poet unifies\r\nour world for us through his metaphors; not as the scientist does by\r\npointing out causal and class relations, but by exhibiting the emotional\r\naffinities of things. He increases the value of single things by giving\r\nthem the values of other things. Every metaphor should serve this\r\npurpose of emotional expression and unification, should be part of an\r\nemotional thought; otherwise it is a mere _tour de force_ of\r\ncleverness, unrelated to the poetic interest and intrinsically\r\nabsurd,--the world has no shore and the wind is not bitter; feeling\r\nalone can justify such comparisons. Moreover, too many metaphors, or\r\nmetaphors too elaborately developed, by scattering the attention, or\r\nby drawing it away from the meaning of which the image should be a\r\npart, have the effect of no image at all. The poetry of Francis\r\nThompson, for example, loses rather than gains vitality through its\r\nimaginative exuberance. We object to decadent poets, not because they\r\nare sensuous, but because they lack feeling; with them sensation,\r\ninstead of supporting emotion, supplants it. Such poets seek to atone\r\nfor their want of vigorous feeling by stimulating our eyes and ears.\r\n\r\nIf, as I believe, emotional thought rather than imagery is the essence\r\nof poetry, then the modern school of imagists and their French forbears\r\namong the \"Parnassiens\" are mistaken. Their effort comes in the end\r\nto a revival of the old thesis _ut pictura poesis_, the attempt\r\nto make poetry a vision of nature rather than an expression of the\r\ninner life. They would lead poetry away from the subjectivity of emotion\r\ninto the outer object world. Now, it is indeed possible for the poet\r\nto represent nature through the images which words evoke in the mind,\r\nand these images may have significance for feeling. Their very evocation\r\nin musical language is bound to lend them some warmth of mood. Yet--as\r\nLessing showed in his _Laocoon_, despite all the crabbed narrowness\r\nof his treatment--it is hopeless for the poet to enter into rivalry\r\nwith the painter or sculptor. The colors and forms of things which the\r\npoet paints for the eye of the mind are mere shadows in comparison\r\nwith those which we really see.[Footnote: The best the poet-painter\r\ncan do is to express his memories of the outer world; but apart from\r\nsome vivid emotion, memories are unsatisfactory in comparison with\r\nrealities.] We admire the marvelous workmanship of such verses as the\r\nfollowing of Gautier, but they leave us cold; even the melody of the\r\nlanguage is incapable of making them warm. How poor they are beside\r\na painting!\r\n\r\n  Les femmes passent sous les arbres\r\n  En martre, hermine et menu-vair\r\n  Et les deesses, frileux marbres,\r\n  Ont pris aussi l'abit d'hiver.\r\n\r\n  La Venus Anadyomene\r\n  Est en pelisse a capuchon:\r\n  Flore, que la brise malmene,\r\n  Plonge ses mains dans son manchon.\r\n\r\n  Et pour la saison, les bergeres\r\n  De Coysevox et de Coustou,\r\n  Trouvant leures echarpes legeres\r\n  Ont des boas autour du cou.\r\n\r\nOf course, poetic pictures can be painted--Gautier has painted them--but\r\nthe standard for each art is set by what it can do uniquely well. If\r\nthe poet works in the domain of the painter, we tend to judge him by\r\nthe alien standards of another art, where he is bound to fall short;\r\nwhile if he works within his own province, we judge him by his own\r\nautonomous laws, under which he can achieve perfection.\r\n\r\nOftentimes, confessing the inability of the image to stand alone, these\r\npoets make it into a symbol of some mood or emotional thought. Yet the\r\nimage remains the chief object of the poet's care; it was clearly the\r\nfirst thing in his mind; the interpretation is an afterthought. The\r\npoem therefore falls into two parts--a picture and an interpretation,\r\nwith little organic relation between them. Another one of Gautier's\r\npoems will serve to illustrate what I mean.[Footnote: There are some\r\ngood examples of this in Baudelaire's _Fleures du Mat_. See for\r\none,_L'Albatros_.]\r\n\r\nLES COLOMBES\r\n\r\n  Sur le coteau, la-bas ou sont les tombes,\r\n  Un beau palmier, comme un panache vert,\r\n  Dresse sa tete, ou le soir les colombes\r\n  Viennent nicher et se mettre a couvert,\r\n\r\n  Mais le matin elles quittent les branches;\r\n  Comme un collier qui s'egrene, on les voit\r\n\r\n  S'eparpiller dans Fair bleu, toutes blanches,\r\n  Et se poser plus loin sur quelque toil.\r\n\r\n  Mon ame est l'arbre ou tous les soirs, comme elles,\r\n  De blancs essaims de folles visions\r\n  Tombent des cieux, en palpitant des ailes,\r\n  Pour s'envoler des les premiers rayons.\r\n\r\nFinally, the effort to detach poetry from the inner world and make it\r\nan expression of outer things, is incompatible with its musical\r\ncharacter. For music is essentially subjective, an expression of pure\r\nmood unaffixed to objects. As rhythmical, poetry shares the inwardness\r\nof music; wherefore, unless its rhythm is to be a mere functionless,\r\nornamental dress, whatever it expresses should have its source in the\r\ninner man. Of course, through their meanings, word-sounds indicate the\r\ncauses and objects of emotion--and this differentiates music from\r\npoetry--but in poetry the emotion is still the primary thing, springing\r\nfrom inner strivings, and not from objects, as in painting and\r\nsculpture. It is therefore no accident that the contemporary imagists\r\ntend to abandon the forms of verse; their poetry has little or no\r\nregular rhythm; it approximates to prose. For in proportion as poetry\r\nbecomes free, it ceases to be tied to musical expressiveness, and may\r\nbecome objective, without prejudice to its own nature. Prose poetry,\r\nand prose too, of course, may be highly emotional and subjective, for\r\nwords can express emotions directly without any rhythmical ordering;\r\nyet prose need not be subjective, as poetry must be. There is no\r\nabsolute difference between prose and poetry; for even prose has its\r\nrhythm and its euphony, its expressiveness of the medium; yet in prose\r\nthe rhythm is irregular and accidental and the expressiveness of the\r\nmedium incomplete, while in poetry the rhythm is regular and pervasive\r\nand ideally every sound-element, as mere sound, is musical. But this\r\nmore complete musical expressiveness of the medium restricts poetry\r\nto a more inward world.\r\n\r\nBy abandoning the strict forms and restraints of regular rhythms, the\r\nwriters of free verse think to gain spontaneity and something of the\r\namplitude of prose; yet it is doubtful whether they gain as much as\r\nthey lose. For, in the hands of the skillful poet, the form, having\r\nbecome second nature, ceases to be a bond; and the expression, by\r\ntaking on regularity of rhythm, acquires a concentration and mnemonic\r\nvalue which free verse cannot achieve. In comparison with free verbal\r\nexpressions, verse forms are, indeed, artifices; yet they are not\r\nartificial, in the bad sense of functionless, for they possess\r\nirreplaceable values. Nevertheless, it would be strange if they were\r\nnot from time to time abandoned, the poet reverting to the freedom of\r\nordinary speech; just as now and then, in civilized communities, we\r\nfind vigorous and sincere men who tire of culture and take to the\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\nThe triplicity of the word, as sound, image, meaning, provides a certain\r\njustification for the variety of tastes in poetry, and accounts for\r\nthe difficulty of setting up a single universal standard. There is an\r\nunstable equilibrium between the three aspects of words; hence poetry\r\ntends to become predominantly music or painting or thought, yet can\r\nnever succeed in becoming completely any one of these. And it is\r\ninevitable that some people should be more sensitive to one rather\r\nthan to another of the aspects of words, preferring therefore the more\r\nmusical, or the more thoughtful, or the more pictorial poetry. And so\r\nwe have poems that would be music, and others that would be pictures,\r\nand still others that would be epigrams. And each kind has a certain\r\nright and beauty; but no kind has the unique beauty that is poetical.\r\nWe do not ask their makers not to produce them, nor do we condemn the\r\npleasures which they afford us, but we cannot commend them without\r\nreservation. For the best poems achieve a synthesis of the elements\r\nof words,--they are at once musical and imaginative and thoughtful.\r\nYet with difficulty; for there is an antagonism among the elements:\r\nwhen the music is insistent, the thought is obscured; when the images\r\nare elaborate, their meaning is lost to sight; when the thought is\r\nsubtle or profound, it rejects the image and is careless of sound.\r\nSwinburne's poetry is full of philosophy, but is so sensuous and musical\r\nthat we miss its thoughts; Browning is too subtle a thinker to be a\r\nmusician. The complexity of poetry is the source of its strength,\r\nlending it something of the inwardness of music and the plasticity of\r\nthe pictorial arts; but is also the source of its weakness. Seldom\r\ndoes it achieve the technical purity and perfection of music and\r\npainting and sculpture. Music has a clear and simple medium, painting\r\nand sculpture work with colors and forms which almost are what they\r\nrepresent; but word-sounds are not what they mean, and what they mean\r\nis not precisely the same as the images which they evoke; too often\r\nthe correspondence is factitious and artificial, rarely is there fusion.\r\nYet, as I have tried to show, when meaning is made central, sound may\r\nfit it closely, and when the meaning is emotional, the music of sound\r\nmay echo its cry, and the image, instead of rebelling, may serve.\r\nEmotional thought is the essence of poetry and the link between its\r\nmusic and its pictures.\r\n\r\nOf the different modes of poetry, the lyric has rightly seemed the\r\nmost typical. Being an expression of a single, simple mood, its\r\nsubject-matter is most closely akin to the musical expressiveness of\r\nthe rhythm and euphony of the medium. When, moreover, the mood is a\r\ncommon one, there occurs that identification of self with the passion\r\nexpressed characteristic of music: the utterance becomes ours as well\r\nas the poet's; the \"I\" of the poem is the \"I\" who read. This is\r\nespecially true when the setting and causes of the emotion are without\r\nname or place or date; the poem then shares the timelessness and\r\nuniversality of music. In such a lyric there is complete symmetry in\r\nthe relation between speaker and hearer; the poet unburdens his heart\r\nto us, and we in receiving his message tell it back to him. When, on\r\nthe other hand, in explaining his feelings, the poet relates them to\r\nevents and persons which have been no part of our experience, this\r\nsymmetry is lost; we no longer utter the poem ourselves, but merely\r\nhear the poet speak. Such poetry is already approaching the dramatic;\r\nfor although still the expression of the poet's life, it is no longer\r\nan expression of the reader's life, and the poet also, as he lives\r\npast his experience, must come at length to view it as if it were\r\nanother's.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, paradoxical as it may sound, dramatic poetry is dramatic in\r\nproportion as it is lyrical--that is, according to the degree to which\r\nthe poet has made the life of others his own. Dramatic poetry, when\r\ntruly poetic, is a series of lyrics of the less universal type. In\r\nanother respect, however, dramatic poetry is essentially different\r\nfrom the lyrical. For, in dramatic poetry, each utterance is a response\r\nor invitation to another utterance, while in lyric poetry, utterance\r\nis complete in itself. The one is social, the other personal: in the\r\nappreciation of the lyric, the reader is just himself; in the\r\nappreciation of dramatic poetry, he is a whole society, becoming now\r\nthis man and now that. The unity of the one is the unity of a single\r\nmood; the unity of the other is the interaction of the dramatis person\r\nas it works itself out in the mind of the reader. And this difference,\r\nas we have seen, is imaged in the form. Being self-contained, the lyric\r\nis a harmonious whole, in which the parts may be repeated for emphasis;\r\nlooking backward and forward, the dramatic utterance is a progressive\r\nand incomplete whole, which cannot stay for iteration. Lyric poetry\r\nis like a communication from friend to friend, intimate and meditative;\r\ndramatic poetry is like a passionate conversation which one overhears.\r\n\r\nThe life portrayed in the epic poem is even less direct than that which\r\nis portrayed in the drama; for there the poet does not impersonate the\r\nagents in the story, but describes them. His description is the first\r\nthing which we get; we get the action only indirectly through that.\r\nHence the story-teller himself--his manner of telling, his reactions\r\nto what he tells, his sympathy, humor, and intelligence--are part of\r\nwhat he expresses. He himself is partly theme. No matter how hard he\r\nmay try to do so, he cannot exclude himself; through his choice of\r\nwords, through his illustrations, through his style, \"which is the\r\nman,\" he will reveal himself. [Footnote: See Lipps: _Aesthetik_,\r\nBd. 1, s. 495 et seq.] We inevitably apprehend, not merely his thoughts,\r\nbut him thinking. In the epic form of poetry, the poet has, moreover,\r\nan opportunity for a more direct mode of self-revelation, an opportunity\r\nfor comment and judgment upon the life which he portrays. And this we\r\nshould accept, not in a spirit of controversy or criticism, but with\r\nsympathy, as a part of the total aesthetic expression, striving to get,\r\nnot only the poet's story, but his point of view regarding it as well.\r\n\r\nThis duality in the life of the epic involves a two-foldness in its\r\ntime. In both lyric and dramatic poetry, life moves before us as a\r\nsingle stream actual in the present; but in the epic there is the time\r\nof the story-teller, which is present, and the time of the events that\r\nhe relates, which is past. And being past, these events appear as it\r\nwere at a distance, at arms' length and remote; they lack the vivid\r\nreality of things present. Moreover, since the past is finished, unlike\r\nthe present which is ever moving and creating itself anew, the epic,\r\nin comparison with the drama, comes to us with its parts as it were\r\ncoexisting and complete, more after the manner of space than of time.\r\nAnd just as a spatial thing allows us to survey its parts by turn,\r\nsince they are all there before we look; so, in reading an epic, we\r\nfeel that we can proceed at our leisure and, despite the causal\r\nrelation, take the incidents in any order. It is not so in the drama,\r\nwhere events move rapidly and make themselves in a determined sequence.\r\nThis is what Goethe meant when he said that substantiality was the\r\ncategory of the epic, causality of the drama, although, of course,\r\nthis distinction is not absolute.\r\n\r\nFinally, the fact that the epic poet tells rather than impersonates\r\nhis story, enables him to enlarge its scope; for by means of\r\ndescriptions he can introduce nature as one of the persons of the\r\naction. [Footnote: Compare Munsterberg: _The Eternal Values_, p.\r\n233.] He can show the molding influence of nature upon man, and how\r\nman, in turn, interacts not only with his fellows, but with his\r\nenvironment. Fate, in the sense of the non-human determinants of man's\r\ncareer, can show its hand. In the _Odyssey_, for example, shipwreck\r\nand the interference of the gods are factors as decisive as Odysseus'\r\ncourage and cunning. By contrast, in lyric poetry, nature is merely\r\na reflection of moods; in dramatic poetry, it is simply the passive,\r\ncausally ineffective stage for a social experience wholly determined\r\nby human agents. This distinction is, however, not absolute. In\r\n_Brand_, for example, through the stage directions and the\r\nutterance of the persons, we are indirectly made aware of the control\r\nexerted by the physical background of the action; in the Greek drama\r\nwe learn this from the Chorus and the Prologue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nPROSE LITERATURE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is an almost universal feeling, expressed in many common phrases,\r\nthat prose literature is not one of the fine arts. The reason is this:\r\nin prose literature there is a conspicuous absence of beauty of form\r\nand sensation, of the decorative, in comparison with the other arts.\r\nThe vague expressiveness and charm of the medium, the musical aspect,\r\nis largely lacking. Not wholly lacking, of course, as a multitude of\r\nbeautiful passages testify; yet, in general, it remains true that, in\r\nprose, the medium tends to be transparent, sacrificing itself in order\r\nthat nothing may stand between what it reveals to thought and the\r\nimagination. It fulfills its function when the words are not unpleasant\r\nto the ear, and when their flow, adapting itself to the span and\r\npulsation of the attention, is so smooth as to become unnoticeable,\r\nlike the movement of a ship on a calm sea,--when it is a means to an\r\nend, not an end in itself.\r\n\r\nProse literature is, therefore, incompletely beautiful. The full meaning\r\nand value of the aesthetic are not to be found there, but rather in\r\npoetry, painting, sculpture, music, architecture. Yet prose literature\r\nremains art, if incomplete art--a free, personal expression of life,\r\nfor the sake of contemplation. As free, it differs from verbal\r\nexpression in the service of practical ends, and as personal, it cannot\r\nbe classed with science. Throughout the long course of its history,\r\nit has tended to become now the one, now the other of these--and its\r\nlack of the decorative element has done much to make this possible--but\r\nits power to outlast the moral and political issues which it has so\r\noften sought to direct, and its well-merited rejection by sociologists\r\nand psychologists as anything more than material for their work, are\r\nsufficient evidence and warning of where it properly belongs,--among\r\nthe arts. The sacrifice of the musical element in the medium does not\r\nhave to be justified on practical grounds as making for efficiency,\r\nor on scientific grounds as favoring analysis, but may be understood\r\nfrom the artistic standpoint. For it was only through a method and\r\nmedium that renounced the musical manner of poetry, with its vaguely\r\nexpressive, yet rigid forms, that the fullness and minuteness of life\r\ncould be represented.\r\n\r\nEven the more fluently musical manner of poetical prose is unsuited\r\nas a medium for the expression of the kind of life which is represented\r\nin normal prose. Poetical prose is appropriate for the expression of\r\ndeeds and sentiments of high and mystical import only, but not for the\r\nexpression of the more commonplace or definitely and complexly\r\narticulated phases of life. For the latter, the broader and freer and\r\nmore literal method of strict prose is the only appropriate medium of\r\nexpression. The unmusical character of prose style is not determined\r\nby weakness, but by adaptation to function.\r\n\r\nAnd, although the medium of prose is attenuated almost to the vanishing\r\npoint, where it may seem to be lost, it may nevertheless borrow from\r\nits content a beauty of rhythm, imagery, and form that will seem to\r\nbe its very own. For in language, as we observed in our discussion of\r\npoetry, the meaning and the symbol are so closely one, that it becomes\r\nimpossible, except by analysis, to distinguish them. Prose rhythm is\r\nfundamentally a rhythmical movement of ideas, like poetic rhythm, only\r\nwithout regularization; yet, since the ideas are carried by the words,\r\nit belongs to them also; images blossom from ideas, yet they too seem\r\nto belong to the words in which they are incarnated; and the harmony\r\nand symmetry which thoughts and images may contain as we compose them\r\nsynthetically in the memory, make an architecture of words. The\r\ntransparent medium of prose shares the beauty of its content, just as\r\na perfect glass partakes of the color of the light which it transmits.\r\n\r\nThe psychologic roots of prose literature are the impulses to self-\r\nrevelation and to acquaintance with life. Every thing that has once\r\nentered into our lives, no matter how intimate, craves to come out;\r\nthe instinct of gregariousness extends, as we have noted, to the whole\r\nof the mind. The completely private and uncommunicated makes us as\r\nuncertain and afraid of ourselves as physical loneliness. But in\r\naddition to the dislike for any form of isolation, even when purely\r\nspiritual, there is another factor which determines\r\nself-revelation,--the desire for praise. We want a larger audience for\r\nour exploits than the people immediately involved in them, so we tell\r\nthem to any listening ear. The friend whispering his confession\r\nillustrates the one motive; the hero bragging of his deeds illustrates\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nThe desire to hear another's story is the obverse of the desire to\r\ntell one about oneself, just as the impulse to welcome a friend is the\r\ncomplement of his impulse to seek our companionship; we receive from\r\nhim exactly what he takes from us,--an enlargement of our social world,\r\nthe creation of another social bond. If we cannot hear his story from\r\nhis own lips, we want to hear it from some third person, who will\r\nsurely be glad to relate it, since he, as bearer of the news, will\r\nbring to himself something of the glory of the hero. There is malice\r\nenough in gossip, but most of it is the purest kind of mental and\r\nemotional satisfaction. Our interest in it is of exactly the same kind\r\nas our interest in novels and romances. The stories which we tell about\r\nourselves and our friends make up the ephemeral, yet real prose\r\nliterature of daily life.\r\n\r\nMost stories probably had their origin in more or less literal\r\ntranscriptions from real life. History is the basis of literature.\r\nHowever, as stories are passed from one person to another, fiction\r\nencroaches upon fact. Details are forgotten and have to be filled out\r\nfrom the imagination; then a sheer delight in invention enters in; it\r\nis so interesting to see if you can make a world as good as the real\r\none, or even outdo it in strangeness and wonder, provided, of course,\r\nyou can still get yourself believed. Even in the relation of real\r\nevents, creation inevitably plays a part; the whole of any story is\r\nnot worth telling; there must be selection, emphasis upon the most\r\nstriking particulars, and synthesis.\r\n\r\nBesides the opportunity which it gives of unhampered control over the\r\nstory, fiction has still other advantages. The interest which we take\r\nin tales of real life is bound up with personal appeals. This is most\r\nracy in gossip, but something of the kind lingers in all narratives\r\nof fact. Literature can become disinterested and universal in its\r\nappeal only when, keeping the semblance of life, it becomes a work of\r\npure imagination. It is then, as Aristotle said, more philosophical,\r\nthat is, more universal and typical, than history.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage of fiction as compared with history is its\r\ncompleteness. The knowledge which we possess of the lives of others\r\nis the veriest fragment. We know, of course, our own lives best; but\r\neven of these, unless we are at the end of our years, we do not know\r\nthe outcome. We know next well the life of an intimate--wife, child,\r\nsweetheart, friend--yet not all of that; there is much he will not\r\ntell us and much else which we cannot observe; for even he dwells with\r\nus for a brief time only, and then is gone. Of other people, we can\r\nknow still less; we can observe something, we can get more from hearsay;\r\nbut that is a chaos of impressions; the larger part is inference and\r\nconstruction, a work of the imagination, which may or may not be true.\r\nEven the biography, carefully made from all available data in the way\r\nof personal recollections, letters, and diaries, although it may\r\napproach to wholeness, remains, nevertheless, very largely a\r\nconstruction, a work of literary fiction. The autobiography comes still\r\ncloser; yet, since it is designed for a public which cannot be expected\r\nto view it in a solidly detached fashion, it suffers from the reticence\r\nwhich inevitably intrudes to suppress. In fiction alone, none except\r\nartistic motives need intervene to bid silence.\r\n\r\nHowever, although fiction be a purely ideal world of imagined life,\r\nit is essentially the same as the real social world. For that world\r\nis also imaginary. We have direct experience of our own lives alone;\r\nthe lives of others can exist for us only in our thought about them.\r\nTo be sure, our daily contact with the bodies of our friends and\r\nassociates gives to this thought something of the pungency of\r\nself-knowledge; yet in absence, they live for us, as the characters\r\nin a novel, only in our thought. And the majority of the people,\r\npersonally unknown to us, who make up our larger social world--and for\r\nmost of us this includes the great ones who are such potent factors\r\nin determining it--are real to us in the same way that Diana or Esmond\r\nare real. All historical figures belong to this world of imagination.\r\nOur friends too, as they pass out of our lives or die, and we ourselves\r\neventually, will sink into it.\r\n\r\nOur interest in the fictional world of the writer is, moreover,\r\nessentially the same as our interest in the real world. Its persons\r\narouse in us the same emotions of admiration, love, or dislike. They\r\nsatisfy the same need for social stimulation, the same curiosity about\r\nlife. Just as we have certain instincts and habits of movement that\r\nmake us restless when they are not satisfied, and afford us a wild joy\r\nin walking and running when we are released from confinement, so we\r\nhave certain instincts and habits of feeling towards persons which\r\ndemand objects and produce joy when companions are found. An unsatisfied\r\nor superabundant sociability lies back of our love of fiction. We read\r\nbecause we are lonely or because our fellow men have become trite and\r\nfail to stimulate us sufficiently. If our fellows were not so reticent,\r\nif they would talk to us and tell us their stories with the freedom\r\nand the brightness of a Stevenson, or if their lives were so fresh and\r\nvivid that we never found them dull, perhaps we should not read at\r\nall. But, as it is, we can satisfy our craving for knowledge of life\r\nonly by extending our social world through fiction. Fiction may teach\r\nus, edify us, make us better men--it may serve all these purposes\r\nincidentally, but its prime purpose as art is to provide us with new\r\nobjects for social feeling and knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe interest which we take in fictitious action is also like that which\r\nwe take in real action. The same emotions of desire for the attainment\r\nof a goal, suspense, hope, fear, excitement, curiosity and its\r\nsatisfaction, joy, despair, are aroused. And we have a need to\r\nexperience these emotions at high pitch greater than our everyday lives\r\ncan satisfy. Our lives are seldom adventurous all over; there are\r\nmonotonous interludes with no melody, offering us little that is new\r\nto learn. Our love for war and sport shows that we were not built\r\norganically for humdrum. Now literature helps to make up for this\r\ndeficiency in real life by providing us with adventures in which we\r\ncan participate imaginatively, and from which we can derive new\r\nknowledge. If real life did supply us with all the intense living that\r\nwe demand, we might not care to read, although the love of adventure\r\ngrows by feeding, and many an active man revels in tales which simulate\r\nhis own exploits.\r\n\r\nIt follows that the novelist should imitate life, yet at the same time\r\nraise its pitch. The realists imitate life deliberately, and we measure\r\ntheir worth by their truth, but they select the intense moments. The\r\nromancers and weavers of fairy tales, on the other hand, instead of\r\nchoosing the vivid moments of real life, in order to stimulate the\r\nemotions, accomplish the same end by exciting wonder and amazement at\r\nthe exaggerations and unheard-of novelties which they create. Yet even\r\nthey give us truth, not truth in the sense of fact, but in the sense\r\nof a world which arouses the same elementary emotions, intensified\r\nthough they be through amazement, as are aroused by fact. It matters\r\nnot how outlandish their tales so long as they do this. Love stories\r\nare so widely interesting because love is the one very vivid emotion\r\nin most people's lives, although there are other experiences--warfare,\r\nthe pursuit of great aims, the clash of purposes and beliefs, the\r\ngrowth of souls--equally intense. Dante's three themes, Venus, Salus,\r\nVirtus,[Footnote: See his _De Vulgari Eloquentia._] broadly\r\ninterpreted, cover the range of literary subjects.\r\n\r\nOf course, since we secure no personal triumphs in reading, and every\r\none wishes to play his own part successfully in real life, literature\r\ncannot become a substitute for life, except with the artist who triumphs\r\nin making his story. Nevertheless, as Henry James says, fiction may\r\nand should compete with life, and this it can do by giving us the\r\nfeelings aroused by action without imposing upon us the responsibilities\r\nand the fateful results of action itself; there we can learn new things\r\nabout life without incurring the risks of participation in it. We can\r\nplay the part of the adventurer without being involved in any blame;\r\nwe can fall in love with the heroine without any subsequential\r\nentanglements; we can be a hero without suffering the penalties of\r\nheroism; we can travel into foreign lands without deserting our business\r\nor emptying our purses. Hence, although no one would exchange life for\r\nliterature, one is better content, having literature, to forego much\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nThe elements of every story are these five: character, incident, nature,\r\nfate, and milieu--the social, historical, and intellectual background.\r\nCharacter and incident are capable of some degree of separation, so\r\nfar as, in novels of adventure, the personalities necessary to carry\r\non the action may be very abstract or elementary, and so far as, in\r\nso-called psychological novels, the number of events related may be\r\nvery small and their interest dependent upon their effect on character;\r\nbut one without the other is as inconceivable in a story as it is in\r\nlife itself, and the development of fiction has been steadily in the\r\ndirection of their interdependence. Aristotle's dictum regarding the\r\nsuperior importance of plot over character applies to the drama only,\r\nand because character cannot well be revealed there except through\r\naction. The construction of character depends upon the delineation of\r\ndistinctive and recognizable physical traits, a surprisingly small\r\nnumber sufficing, a mere name being almost enough; upon the definition\r\nof the individual's position in a group--his relation to family,\r\ntownspeople, and other associates--a matter of capital importance;\r\nand, finally, information about his more permanent interests and\r\nattitudes. This construction is best made piecemeal, the character\r\ndisclosing itself gradually during the story, as it does in life, and\r\ngrowing under the stress of circumstances. The old idea of fixity of\r\ncharacter does not suit our modern notions of growth; we demand that\r\ncharacter be created by the story; it should not preexist, as\r\nSchopenhauer thought it should, with its nature as determinate and its\r\nreactions as predictable as those of a chemical substance. And although\r\nin their broad outlines the possibilities of human nature are perhaps\r\nfewer in number than the chemical substances, the variations of these\r\ntypes in their varying environments are infinite. To create a poignant\r\nuniqueness while preserving the type is the supreme achievement of the\r\nwriter of fiction. We want as many of the details of character, and\r\nno more, as are necessary to this end.\r\n\r\nBy incident is meant action expressing character or action or event\r\ndetermining fate. There are a thousand actions, mechanical or habitual,\r\nperformed by us all, which throw no light upon our individuality.\r\nAlmost all of these the novelist may neglect, or if he wishes to\r\ndescribe them, a single example will serve to reveal whatever uniqueness\r\nthey may hide. There are an equal number of actions and events like\r\nblind alleys leading nowhere; from these also the novelist abstracts;\r\nit is only when he can trace some effect upon fate or character that\r\nhe is interested. The delineation of nature or the milieu is governed\r\nby the same reference: a social or intellectual environment, no matter\r\nhow interesting in itself, without potent individualities which it\r\nmolds, or scenery, no matter how romantic, unless it is a theater of\r\naction or a spiritual influence upon persons, has no place in a story.\r\nEach of these, however, may by itself become the subject-matter of a\r\nliterary essay, provided the writer's own moods and appreciations are\r\nincluded; otherwise it is a topic for sociology, history, or topography,\r\nnot for literature.\r\n\r\nBy fate in a story I mean the writer's feeling for causality. As the\r\nmaker of an image of life, the writer must portray life as molded by\r\nits past and by all the circumstances surrounding it. He must present\r\ncharacter as determined by personal influence, by nature and the milieu;\r\nhe must have a vivid sense for the interrelation of incidents. The\r\nfeeling for fate is independent of any special philosophical view of\r\nthe world; it does not imply fatalism or the denial of the spontaneous\r\nand originative force of personality; it is simply recognition of the\r\nwholeness of life. Nor, again, does it imply the possibility of\r\npredicting the end of a story from the beginning, for the living\r\nsequence, forging its links as it proceeds, is not mechanical; but it\r\ndoes imply that after things have happened we must be able to perceive\r\ntheir relatedness--the beginning, middle, and end as one whole. In the\r\nstory, there must be the same kind of combination of necessity and\r\ncontingency that there is in life: we must be sure that every act and\r\nincident will have its effect, and we must be able to divine, in a\r\ngeneral way, what that effect will be; but owing to the complexity of\r\nlife, which prevents us from knowing all the data of its problems, and\r\nowing to the spontaneity of its agents and the creative syntheses\r\nwithin its processes, we must never be able to be certain just what\r\nthe effect will be like; our every calculation must be subject to the\r\ncorrection of surprise. Suspense and excitement must go hand in hand\r\nwith a feeling for a developing inner necessity. There is no story\r\nwithout both. Yet no formula for the amount of each can be devised.\r\nThe dependence of man upon nature makes inevitable the occurrence of\r\nwhat we call accidents, violent breaks in the tissue of personal and\r\nsocial life, unaccountable from the point of view of our human purposes.\r\nBy admitting the part played by the non-human background in determining\r\nfate, the naturalistic school of writers have enlarged the vision of\r\nthe novelist beyond the range of the tender-minded sentimentalist. It\r\nis to be expected, moreover, that coincidences should occur,--the\r\nmeeting of independent lines of causation with consequences fateful\r\nto each. A careful investigation would disclose that most interesting\r\ncareers have been largely determined by coincidences. The only demand\r\nthat we can make of the artist in this regard is that he do not give\r\nus so many of these that his work will seem unreal. We must not feel\r\nthat he is making the story in order to surprise us and thrill us--the\r\npurpose of melodrama; the story should make itself. Hardy's _The\r\nReturn of the Native_ is an illustration of failure here; the\r\ncoincidences are so many that it seems magical, the work of a capricious\r\ngenius, not of nature.\r\n\r\nBy fate in a story we do not mean, of course, the mere causal\r\nconcatenation of events, for some relation to a purposeful life is\r\nalways implied. But since this relation is a general condition applying\r\nto all art, we shall consider it here only as it affects the unity of\r\na story. No rule can be laid down for the compass of a story; it may\r\ncover a small incident, as in many short stories, or it may embrace\r\nthe whole or the most significant part of a life. The requirement that\r\nthere be a beginning, middle, and end holds, but does not enlighten\r\nus as to what constitutes an end. Death makes one natural end to a\r\nstory, since it makes an end to life itself; but within the span of\r\na life the parts are not so clearly defined. Yet despite the continuity\r\nand overlapping of the parts of life, there are certain natural breaks\r\nand divisions,--the working out of a plan to fulfillment or disaster,\r\nthe termination or consummation of a love affair, the commission of\r\na crime with its consequences, or more subtle things, such as the\r\nbreaking up of an old attitude and the formation of a new one. In life\r\nitself there are incidents that are closed because they cease to affect\r\nus deeply any more, purposes which we abandon because we can get no\r\nfarther with them or because they have found their natural fulfillment,\r\npoints of view which we have to relinquish because life supplies us\r\nwith new facts which they do not include. The unity of a story should\r\nmirror these natural unities. The search for the wholeness of life\r\nshould not blind us to the relative isolation of its parts; and there\r\nis fate in the parts as well as in the whole.\r\n\r\nThe selection of incidents for their bearing upon fate, the selection\r\nof significant traits for the construction of character, with the\r\nresulting unity and simplicity of the parts and the whole, is\r\nresponsible for most of the ideality of fiction as compared with real\r\nlife. Real life is a confused medley of impressions of people and\r\nevents, a mixture of the important and the unimportant, the\r\nconsequential and the inconsequential, with no evident pattern. Of\r\nthis, literary art is the _verklartes Bild_. It is not because,\r\nin literature, men are happier and nobler that life seems superior\r\nthere; but because its outlines are sharper, its design more\r\nperspicuous, the motives that sway it better understood. It has the\r\nadvantage over life that a landscape flooded with sunshine has over\r\none shrouded in darkness.\r\n\r\nThe way the literary artist builds up the ideal social world of fiction\r\nfollows closely the method which we all employ in constructing the\r\nreal social world. In real life we start from certain perceived acts\r\nand utterances, to which we then attach purposive meanings, and between\r\nwhich we establish relations. The process of interpretation is so rapid\r\nthat, although strictly inferential in character and having imagination\r\nas its seat, it seems, nevertheless, like direct perception. As we see\r\npeople act and hear them talk, it is as if we had a vision, confused\r\nindeed, yet direct, of their inner lives. And yet, as we have insisted,\r\nthe real social world is constructed, not perceived.\r\n\r\nThe literary artist, unless he calls dramatic art to his aid, cannot\r\npresent the persons and acts of his story; he can only describe them\r\nand report their talk. Description must take the place of vision, a\r\nrecorded conversation the place of a heard one. Yet, by these means,\r\nthe artist can give us almost as direct an intuition as we get from\r\nlife itself; he can make us seem to see and overhear. From the acts\r\nwhich he describes we can infer the motives of the characters, and\r\nfrom the reported conversations we can learn their opinions and dreams.\r\nOr the novelist may insert a letter which we can read as if it were\r\nreal. The resulting image of life will be clearer than any we could\r\nconstruct for ourselves; for the artist can report life more carefully\r\nthan we could observe it; and he can make his characters more articulate\r\nin the expression of themselves than ordinary men, giving them a gift\r\nof tongues like his own. This last is especially characteristic of the\r\ndrama, where sometimes, as in Shakespeare, men speak more like gods\r\nthan like men. And we can listen to the intimate conversation of friends\r\nand lovers, upon which, in real life, we would not intrude.\r\n\r\nThis direct method of exposition through the description of acts and\r\nevents and the record of conversations is the basis of every vivid\r\nstory. It leaves the necessary inferences to the reader, just as life\r\nleaves them to the observer. In the hands of a master like Fontane,\r\nthis method is incomparable; nothing can supplant it. It is the only\r\nmethod available for the dramatist, who, however, can make it still\r\nmore effective through histrionic portrayal. Yet it does not suffice\r\nto satisfy our craving for knowledge of life, for only the broader,\r\nmore obvious feelings can be inferred from the acts of men; the subtler\r\nand more remote escape. Even in conversation these cannot all be\r\nrevealed; for many of them are too intimate to be spoken, and many\r\nagain are unknown even to those who hold them. To-day we ask of the\r\nnovelist that he disclose the finest, most hidden tissues of the soul.\r\nTo this end, the microscopy of analysis, the so-called psychological\r\nmethod, must be employed. The novelist must perform upon his characters\r\nthe same sort of dissection that we perform when, introspecting, we\r\nseek out the obscurer grounds of our conduct. And in the pursuit of\r\nthis knowledge the novelist can oftentimes do better with his characters\r\nthan we can do with ourselves. For utter sincerity regarding ourselves\r\nis impossible; the desire to think well of ourselves prevents us from\r\nrecognizing the truth about ourselves. The novelist, on the contrary,\r\ncan be unprejudiced and can know fully what he himself is creating.\r\nIn order to accomplish this same purpose, the dramatist has to introduce\r\nbits of self-analysis, unusually sincere and penetrating, spoken\r\naloud,--in the old style, monologues. And yet, without sacrificing the\r\ntruthfulness of his own art, he cannot go so deep here as the novelist.\r\n\r\nThrough his analysis of his characters, the novelist must, however,\r\nconstruct them; otherwise he is a psychologist, not an artist. A\r\nsynthetic vision of personality must supervene upon the dissection,\r\nand the emotional interest in character and action must subsist\r\nalongside of the intellectual interest. He must not let us lose the\r\nvivid sense of a living presence. In order to keep this, he must\r\ncontinue to employ the direct method of description of person and\r\naction, and report of conversation. How far the analytic method may\r\nbe carried and at the same time the sense of personality kept intact,\r\nmay be inferred from the work of Henry James, who, nevertheless, seems\r\nat times to fail to bring the out-going threads of his thought back\r\ninto the web which he is weaving.\r\n\r\nAgain, in order to reach the social, historical, and metaphysical\r\nbackground of life--the milieu, the method of thought is the only\r\navailable one. For the milieu is not anything that can be seen or heard\r\nor touched; it does not manifest itself to perception, but has to be\r\nconstructed by a process of inference and synthesis. Much of it, to\r\nbe sure, can be divined from the acts and conversations, from the dress\r\nand manners of the characters, but there is always more that has to\r\nbe directly expounded. The writer cannot rely upon the reader's\r\nperspicacity to make the right inferences, or upon his knowledge to\r\nsupply sufficient data; nor can he make his characters tell all that\r\nhe may want told about their past and the life of the world in which\r\nthey live, and through the influence of which they have become what\r\nthey are. The novelist must construct for the reader the _mise en\r\nscene_ of his story. Yet this must be held in complete subordination\r\nto the story. The intellectual background must lie behind, not athwart\r\nthe story; it must be created for the sake of the story, not the story\r\nfor its sake.\r\n\r\nA philosophy of life, even, is the inevitable presupposition of every\r\nstory. For no writer, no matter how direct and empirical he may be in\r\nhis methods, can escape from looking at life through the glass of\r\ncertain political, social, and religious ideas. He may have none of\r\nhis own construction, yet he will unconsciously share those of his\r\nage. The prose literature of our own age, aside from some minor\r\ndifferences of technique, differs from that of the past chiefly through\r\nits more democratic and naturalistic views of life. And just as we\r\nrightly ask of the novelist that he enlighten us regarding the subtler\r\ncausation of human action, so with equal right we may ask him to exhibit\r\nthe relations of the persons and incidents which he describes to social\r\norganization, spiritual movements, and nature; for only so can they\r\nbe seen in their complete reality. Yet right here lurks a danger\r\nthreatening the enduring beauty of every story thus made complete. For\r\nthe social and cosmic background of life, as we have observed, can be\r\nconstructed only through thought, and thought, particularly regarding\r\nsuch matters, is peculiarly liable to error. The artist who goes very\r\ndeep into this is sure to make mistakes. Even when he tries to use the\r\nlatest sociological, economic, and political theories, he runs great\r\nrisks; for these theories are always one-sided and subject to\r\ncorrection; they never prove themselves to be what the artist thinks\r\nand wants them to be--concrete views which he can apply with utter\r\nfaith. How many stories of the century past have been marred by the\r\nauthor's too ready application of Darwinism to social life! When we\r\ncan separate the story from its intellectual background, the inadequacy\r\nof the latter matters little; for we can apply metaphysical and\r\npolitical criticism to the theory and enjoy the story aesthetically;\r\nbut many of our writers come to life with preconceived ideas deeply\r\naffecting their delineation of it. The picture no longer seems true\r\nbecause we feel that a false theory has prevented the artist from\r\nviewing life concretely and clearly. We could, for example, accept as\r\nnatural and inevitable the ending of _Tess of the D'Urbervilles_,\r\nif Hardy had not presented it as an illustration of the cruel sport\r\nof the gods. As it stands with the author's commentary, we suspect\r\nthat the girl's fate might have been different,--that perhaps he gave\r\nit this turn in order to prove his theory of life.\r\n\r\nThis fault is especially flagrant in the theory-ridden fiction of\r\nto-day. Determination through the past is overemphasized as against\r\nthe influence of present, novel factors in a growing experience;\r\nheredity is given undue weight as against the inborn originality of\r\npersonality and the uniqueness acquired through unique experiences;\r\nthe influence of sensual motives is stressed at the expense of the\r\nmoral; and so on through all the other abstractions and insufficiencies\r\nof \"scientific\" novel writing. The writer may well profit by everything\r\nhe can learn from science; but he should not let his knowledge prevent\r\nhim from seeing life concretely and as a whole. The literary man's\r\nscience and philosophy are bound to be condemned by the expert, but\r\nhis concrete delineations of life based on direct observation and vivid\r\nsympathy and imagination are impeccable. His theories may be false,\r\nbut these will always be true. Nothing can take their place in fiction.\r\nIt is they which give enduring value to such tales as _Morte d'Arthur_,\r\ndespite all the crudity of the intellectual background.\r\n\r\nReflections upon life may become matter for literature in the essay,\r\nquite apart from any story. But the essay, like the story, unless it\r\nis to compete at a disadvantage with science and philosophy, must rely\r\nupon first-hand personal acquaintance with life, and artistic\r\nexpression. The more abstract and theoretical it becomes, the more\r\nprecarious its worth. I do not mean that the essayist may not\r\ngeneralize, but his generalizations should be limited to the scope of\r\nhis experience of life. I do not mean that he should not philosophize,\r\nbut his philosophy should be, like Goethe's or Emerson's, an expression\r\nof intuition and faith. Properly, the literary essay is a distinct\r\nartistic genre--the expression of a concrete _thinking_ personality, and\r\nits value consists in the living wisdom it contains. Such essays as\r\nthose of a Montaigne or a La Rochefoucauld make excellent materials for\r\nthe social sciences, and can never be displaced by them as sources of\r\nknowledge of life.\r\n\r\nConsiderations similar to those which we have adduced regarding the\r\nimplied philosophy of a story apply to its moral purpose. We cannot\r\ndemand of the writer that he have no moral purpose or that he leave\r\nmorality out of his story. For, since the artist is also a man, he\r\ncannot rid himself of an ethical interest in human problems or with\r\ngood conscience fail to use his art to help toward their solution. His\r\nobservations of moral experience will inevitably result in beliefs\r\nabout it, and these will reveal themselves in his work. Yet we should\r\ndemand that his view of what life ought to be shall not falsify his\r\nrepresentation of life as it is. Just as soon as the moral of a tale\r\nobtrudes, we begin to suspect that the tale is false. We have such\r\nsuspicions about Bourget, for example, because, as in _Une Divorce_, we\r\nare never left in doubt from the beginning as to the conventions he is\r\nadvocating. And along with the feeling for the reality of the story goes\r\nthe feeling for the validity of the moral; they stand and fall together.\r\nA story's moral, like life's moral, is convincing in proportion as it is\r\nan inference from the facts. The novelist, fearing that we may not have\r\nthe wits to discern it, is justified in drawing this inference himself;\r\nyet it must show itself to be strictly an inference from the story--the\r\nstory must not seem to have been constructed to prove it. \"_Die\r\nWeltgeschichte ist das Weltgericht,_\" wrote Schiller; even so, the\r\ndelineation of life is the criticism of life. To show the scope of\r\ndisillusion, monotony, repression--life's generous impulses narrowed and\r\nmade timid by the social, economic, and political machine--would be a\r\ncriticism of our modern world; there would be no need of moralizing.\r\nThis the Russian novelists seem to have understood; they judged Russian\r\nlife by describing it.\r\n\r\nThe man who writes literature as a means for promulgating political\r\nor moral ideas is either a conservative who desires to return to the\r\nconventions of the past, or else a radical who seeks the establishment\r\nof a new mode of life. The method employed by the former usually\r\nconsists in exposing the restlessness and unhappiness of people who\r\nlive in accordance with \"advanced\" ideas in comparison with the\r\ncontentment of those who follow the older traditions. Such stories\r\nare, however, inconclusive, because they imply the false sociological\r\nthesis that the remedy for present ills is a return to the customs of\r\nthe past. Happiness can indeed exist only in a stable society; but\r\neach age must create its own order to suit its changing needs; it\r\ncannot, if it would, go back to the old. These stories, therefore,\r\nalthough they often contain truthful and valuable pictures of the ills\r\nof contemporary life, and are useful in helping to conserve what is\r\ngood in the spirit of the past, are nevertheless bound to be futile\r\nin their main endeavor.\r\n\r\nThe method of the radical usually consists of two parts: one of\r\ncriticism, designed to show the misery due to existing laws and\r\ninstitutions; another of construction, the disclosure of a new and\r\nbetter system. But here, too, the constructive part of the story is\r\nlikely to be weak. For whether the writer sets forth his program by\r\nputting it into the mouth of one of his characters or appends it as\r\na commentary to his story, the practicability of his scheme is always\r\nopen to question. It is only through trial that any scheme can be shown\r\nto be workable. There is, however, a new method that deserves better\r\nthe name of \"experimental romance\" than Zola's own works. It consists\r\nin portraying people living in accordance with new sentiments and\r\nideals, or even under new institutions imaginatively constructed. Yet\r\nthis method also has its weakness, for it is difficult to make people\r\nbelieve in the reality of a life that has not been actually lived.\r\nStill, this difficulty is not fatal; for experiments in living are\r\nconstantly being made all around us, which the discerning novelist\r\nneeds only to observe and report. He can show the success of these or\r\nhow, if they fail, their failure is due, not to anything inherently\r\nvicious, but simply to adverse law and opinion. Life is full of such\r\nstories waiting for some novelist who is not too timid to tell them.\r\n\r\nWe are thus brought round again to the thesis that the enduringly\r\nvaluable elements of every story are its concrete creations of life.\r\nIn the end, the story teller's fame will rest upon his power to create\r\nand reveal character and upon his sense for fate. There is just one\r\nthing that should be added to this--a rich emotional attitude toward\r\nlife. It is the greater wealth of this that makes a novelist like\r\nThackeray or Anatole France superior to one like Balzac. The personality\r\nthat tells the story is as much a part of the total work as the\r\ncharacters and events portrayed, and must be taken into account in any\r\nfinal judgment of the whole. Without the author's vivid and rich\r\nparticipation, we who read can never be fully engaged, and we shall\r\nfind more of life in the story, the more there is of him in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE DOMINION OF ART OVER NATURE: PAINTING\r\n\r\n\r\nIn literature, as we observed in our last two chapters, nature does\r\nnot find aesthetic expression on its own account. In the lyric, nature\r\nappears only as the reflection of personal moods and thoughts, in the\r\ndrama and novel and epic only as the theater of human action or the\r\ndeterminer of human fate. In painting and sculpture, on the other hand,\r\nthe expression of nature is the primary aim. Of course, in so far as\r\nthis expression is aesthetic, it is an expression not of nature alone,\r\nbut of our responses as well; but nature is the starting point, not\r\nemotion as in lyric poetry, nor the effect upon destiny as in the epic.\r\n\r\nBecause they are expressions of nature, and because the copying of the\r\nhuman body, of trees, clouds, and the like is an indispensable part\r\nof their practice, painting and sculpture have seemed to give support\r\nto the theory of art as imitation. Yet, although the activity of\r\nimitation is a means to the creation of picture and statue, the mere\r\nfact of being a copy is not the purpose of the completed work nor the\r\nground of our pleasure in it. Not its relation to anything outside\r\nitself, no matter how important for its making, but its own intrinsic\r\nqualities constitute its aesthetic worth.\r\n\r\nThis was true of the earliest efforts in these arts. The primitive\r\nartist copied not for the sake of copying, but because he ascribed a\r\nmagical power to images. In the image he believed he somehow possessed\r\nthe object itself, and so could control it; to the image, therefore,\r\nwas transferred all the value and potence of the object. The object\r\nrepresented was deeply significant; it was perhaps the animal upon\r\nwhich the tribe depended for its food, its totem or guardian divinity;\r\nor else, as among the Egyptians, it was the man himself, of whom the\r\nimage was meant to be an enduring habitation for the soul. If primitive\r\nmen had copied indifferent objects, then we might infer that the mere\r\nmaking of an image was the end in view; but this they did not do, and\r\nit has never been the practice of any vigorous group of artists. Only\r\nwhen the means are valued instead of the end--technique in place of\r\nbeauty--does this occur. Through such a mistaking of aims, new\r\ninstruments of expression may be discovered, useful for a future genius,\r\nbut no genuine art is produced. The genuine artist copies, not for the\r\nsake of copying, but in order to create a work of independent beauty.\r\n\r\nThis same transference of value to the image, with the consequent\r\nfreeing of the image from the model, can be observed even in\r\ncommemorative art. A king desires, perhaps, to perpetuate his memory;\r\nhow better than through some enduring likeness in stone or paint? While\r\nhe is alive and after his death this image will remind his subjects\r\nof him and his valorous deeds. The relation to the model seems to be\r\nfundamental; but in proportion to the success of the artist in making\r\na likeness, the stone or paint will be made to seem all alive, and for\r\nthose who cannot come into direct relations with the monarch, he will\r\nbe effectively present in the statue or picture, even when, through\r\ndeath, he is removed from all social and practical relations. Who does\r\nnot feel that Philip the Fourth is present on the Velasquez canvas;\r\nwhere else could one find him so alive? If the work is artistic, the\r\nspectator's interest will center in feeling the life in the color and\r\nline or sculptured form; that it happens to be an imitation of something\r\nelse will become of secondary importance. This is clearest when the\r\nname of the subject is not known; then surely it is the life before\r\nus that can alone concern us. Any feeble copy would serve as a reminder,\r\nbut a living drawing or statue brings the man or woman into our\r\npresence. The aesthetic interest in the work as living supervenes upon\r\nthe interest in it as a mere reminder of life.\r\n\r\nThis freedom from the model and attainment of intrinsic worth in the\r\nwork of art itself is furthered through the realization of beauty in\r\nthe medium of expression. The colors, lines, and shapes which the\r\nartist uses have a direct appeal to the eye and through the eye to\r\nfeeling; hence arise preferences for the most agreeable and expressive.\r\nThe artist discovered that he could express his emotion not only through\r\nrepresenting its object, but through the very colors or lines or shapes\r\nused in the delineation. These effects, found by chance perhaps in the\r\nfirst instance, would later be striven for consciously. In this way,\r\nthrough some grace of line, or symmetry of form, or harmony of color,\r\nthe statue or picture would acquire a power to please quite independent\r\nof any ulterior use or purpose; once more, it would become alive and\r\nof value on its own account.\r\n\r\nWe shall begin our study of the representative arts with drawing and\r\npainting--representation in two dimensions--not because they preceded\r\nsculpture historically, but because, being more complex arts, a solution\r\nof the problems which they raise makes a subsequent survey of the\r\nsimilar problems of the simpler art relatively easy.\r\n\r\nThe media of pictorial expression are color and line, and expression\r\nis attained through them in a twofold fashion. In a picture, every\r\nelement of color or line is expressive directly, just as color and\r\nline, of some vague feeling or mood, and, in addition, chiefly through\r\nits resemblance, represents some action or object. The former kind of\r\nexpression is indispensable. No matter how realistic the imitation,\r\nunless the picture thrill like music, through its mere colors or lines,\r\nit is aesthetically relatively ineffective. It is not sufficient that\r\nthe picture move us through the vicarious presence on the canvas of\r\na moving object; it must stir us in a more immediate fashion through\r\nthe direct appeal of sense. For example, a picture which presents us\r\nwith a semblance of the sea will hold us through the power which the\r\nsea has over us; but it will not hold us so fast as a picture of the\r\nsame subject which, in addition, grips us through its greens and blues\r\nand wavy lines. The one sways us only through the imagination, the\r\nother through our senses as well.\r\n\r\nSensitiveness to color as such, so self-evident to one who possesses\r\nit, seems to be wanting, except in rudimentary fashion, in a great\r\nmany people. They are probably few, however, who do not feel some\r\nstirrings when they look through the stained glass of a cathedral\r\nwindow or upon the red of Venetian glass, or who are entirely\r\nindifferent to the color of silk. The reason for emotional\r\ncolor-blindness is probably not a native incapacity to be affected,\r\nbut rather a diversion of attention; color has come to be only a sign\r\nfor the recognition and subsequent use of things, a signal for a\r\npractical or intellectual reaction. In our haste to recognize and use\r\nwe fail to see, and give ourselves no time to be moved by mere seeing.\r\nBut when, as in art, contemplation, the filling of the mind with the\r\nobject, is the aim, the power to move of the sensuous surface of things\r\nmay come again into its rights.\r\n\r\nThe emotional response to color, vague and abstract and objectless,\r\nis, like music, incapable of adequate expression in words, and for the\r\nsame reason. Words are capable of expressing only the larger and fairly\r\nwell-defined emotions; such subtle shadings and complex mixtures of\r\nfeeling as are conveyed by color and sound are mostly beyond their\r\nken. Colors make us feel and dream as music does in the same\r\nincommunicable fashion. Or rather the only possibility of communicating\r\nthem is through the color schemes arousing them. And for one who\r\nappreciates color this is sufficient; he can point to the colors and\r\nsay--that is what I feel. To render his feeling also in words would\r\nbe a superfluous business, supposing they could be adequate to express\r\nit; or, if they were adequate, that would make expression through color\r\nsuperfluous. The value of any medium consists in its power to express\r\nwhat none other can. Nevertheless, it is possible to find rough verbal\r\nequivalents for the simpler colors. Thus every one would probably agree\r\nwith Lipps and call a pure yellow happy, a deep blue quiet and earnest,\r\nred passionate, violet wistful; would perhaps feel that orange partakes\r\nat once of the happiness of yellow and the passion of red, while green\r\npartakes of the happiness of yellow and the quiet of blue; and in\r\ngeneral that the brighter and warmer tones are joyful and exciting,\r\nthe darker and colder, more inward and restful.\r\n\r\nTo explain the expressiveness of color sensations is as difficult as\r\nto account for the parallel phenomenon in sounds. Here as there resort\r\nis had to the principle of association. Colors get, it is thought,\r\ntheir value for feeling either through some connection with emotionally\r\ntoned objects, like vegetation, light, the sky, blood, darkness, and\r\nfire, or else through some relation to emotional situations, like\r\nmourning or danger, which they have come to symbolize. And there is\r\nlittle doubt that such associations play a part in determining the\r\nemotional meaning of colors--the reticence and distance of blue, the\r\nhappiness of yellow, for example, are partly explained through the\r\nfact that blue is the color of the sky, yellow the color of sunlight;\r\nthe meaning of black is due, partly at any rate, to association with\r\nmourning. Yet neither of these types of association seems sufficient\r\nto explain the full emotional meaning of colors. The conventional\r\nmeanings of colors seem rather themselves to need explanation than to\r\nserve as explanations--why is red the sign of danger, purple royal,\r\nwhite a symbol of purity, black a symbol of mourning? Is it not because\r\nthese colors had some native, original expressiveness which fashion\r\nand habit have only made more definite and turned to special uses? And\r\nif we can explain the reticence of blue through association with the\r\nsky, can we thus explain its quietness? Can the warmth of fire and the\r\nexcitement of blood explain quite all the depth of passionate feeling\r\nin red? The factors enumerated play a part in the complex effect, but\r\nthere seem to be elements still unaccounted for.\r\n\r\nIn order to explain the total phenomenon we must admit, as in the case\r\nof tones, some direct effect of the sensory light stimulus upon the\r\nfeelings. Rays of light affect not only the sensory apparatus, causing\r\nsensations of color; their influence is prolonged into the motor\r\nchannels, causing a total attitude of the organism, the correlate of\r\na feeling. It would be strange if any sensory stimulus were entirely\r\ncut off by itself and did not find its way into the motor stream. But\r\nthese overflows are too diffuse to be noticed in ordinary experience;\r\nthey are obscured through association or are not given time to rise\r\nto the level of clear consciousness, because we are preoccupied with\r\nthe practical or cognitive significance of the colors; only in the\r\nquiet and isolation of contemplation can they come into the focus. Of\r\ncourse the student of the evolution of mind will want to go behind\r\nthese color emotions and inquire why a given color is connected with\r\na given reaction. He may even want to connect them with instinctive\r\nresponses of primitive men. But here we can only speculate; we cannot\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nThe problem is further complicated through the fact that private color-\r\nassociations are formed obscuring the aesthetic meanings, which can\r\nbe rediscovered only through the elimination of the former. Color\r\npreferences are often determined in this way; yet sometimes they spring\r\nfrom another and more radical source--an affinity between personal\r\ntemperament and the feeling tone of the preferred color. A consistent\r\nchoice of blues and grays indicates a specific kind of man or woman,\r\nvery different from the chooser of yellows and reds.\r\n\r\nAlthough single color tones are expressive, they seldom exist alone\r\nin works of art. Significant expression requires variety. The invention\r\nof original and expressive color combinations is a rare gift of genius.\r\nRough rules of color combination have been devised from the practice\r\nof artists and from experiment, the following of which will enable one\r\nto produce faultless patterns, but without genius will never enable\r\none to create a new expression. Color combinations are either harmonious\r\nor balanced, the former produced by colors or tones of colors very\r\nclose to one another, the latter by the contrasting or widely sundered.\r\nIn the one case, we get the quiet commingling of feelings akin to each\r\nother; in the other, the lively tension of feelings opposed. Compare,\r\nfor example, the effect of a Whistler nocturne with a Monet landscape.\r\nThe colors that do not go well together are such as are not close\r\nenough for union nor far enough apart for contrast. They are like\r\npersonalities not sufficiently at one to lose themselves in each other,\r\nyet not sufficiently unlike to be mutually stimulating and enlarging,\r\nbetween whom there can be only a fruitless rivalry turning into hate.\r\nSuch are certain purples and reds, certain greens and blues. Yet,\r\nthrough proper mediation, any two colors can be brought into a\r\ncomposition. All colors are brought together in nature through the\r\nsunlight, and in painting or weaving by giving to rival colors the\r\nsame sheen or brightness. Or again, the union may be effected by\r\ncombining the two with a third which is in a relation of balance or\r\nharmony with each, as in the favorite scheme of blue, red, and green.\r\n\r\nDespite their ability to express, colors cannot stand alone; they must\r\nbe the colors of something, they must make line or shape. Lines, on\r\nthe other hand, seem to be independent of color, as in drawings and\r\netchings; yet there is really some color even there--black and white\r\nand tones of gray. That color and line are independent of one another\r\nin beauty, is, however, shown by works, such as Millet's, which are\r\ngood in line but poor in color. Lines have, as we have already seen,\r\nthe same duality of function as colors: they express feeling directly\r\nthrough their character as mere lines and they represent objects by\r\nsuggesting them through resemblance.\r\n\r\nThere is, in fact, for those who can feel it, a life in lines of the\r\nsame abstract and objectless sort as exists in colors and tones. Lines\r\ngive rise to motor impulses and make one feel and dream, as music does.\r\nThere are many who are cold to this effect; yet few can fail to get\r\nsomething of the vibration or mood of the lines of a Greek vase\r\npainting, a Botticelli canvas, or a Rembrandt etching. The life of\r\nlines is more allied to that of tones than of colors because it\r\npossesses a dynamic movement quality which is absent from the latter.\r\nThis life is, in fact, twofold: on the one hand it is a career, with\r\na beginning, middle, and end, something to be willed or enacted; on\r\nthe other hand it is a temperament or character, a property of the\r\nline as a whole, to be felt. These two aspects of aesthetic lines are\r\nclosely related; they stand to one another much as the temperament or\r\ncharacter of a man stands to his life history, of which it is at once\r\nthe cause and the result. Just as we get a total impression of a man's\r\nnature by following the story of his life, so we get the temperamental\r\nquality of lines by following them with the eye; and just as all of\r\nour knowledge of a man's acts enters into our intuition of his nature,\r\nso we discover the character of the total line by a synthesis of its\r\nsuccessive elements.\r\n\r\nIt is as difficult, more difficult, perhaps, to put into words the\r\ntemperamental quality of lines as to do the parallel thing with colors.\r\nLines are infinite in their possible variations, and the fine shades\r\nof feeling which they may express exceed the number of words in the\r\nemotional vocabulary of any language. Moreover, in any drawing, the\r\ncharacter of each line is partly determined through the context of\r\nother lines; you cannot take it abstractly with entire truth. It is,\r\nhowever, possible to find verbal equivalents for the character of the\r\nmain types of lines. Horizontal lines convey a feeling of repose, of\r\nquiet, as in the wall-paintings of Puvis de Chavannes; vertical lines,\r\nof solemnity, dignity, aspiration, as in so much of the work of\r\nBoecklin; crooked lines of conflict and activity, as in the woodcuts\r\nof Durer; while curved lines have always been recognized as soft and\r\nvoluptuous and tender, as in Correggio and Renoir. The supposition\r\nthat the curved line is the sole \"line of beauty\" is the result of a\r\nnarrow and effeminate idea of the aesthetic; yet it must be admitted\r\nthat this form, since it permits of the greatest amount of variation,\r\nhas the highest power of expression; but in many of its more complex\r\nvarieties it loses much of its soft feminine quality, and takes on\r\nsome of the strength of the other forms.\r\n\r\nThe expressiveness of lines is determined by several--at least three--\r\nfactors. In the first place, the perception of lines is an active\r\nprocess. In order to get a line we have to follow it with the eye; and\r\nif we do not now follow it with our fingers, we at least followed\r\nsimilar lines thus in the past. Now this process of the perception of\r\na line requires of us an energy of attention to the successive elements\r\nof the line as we pass over them and a further expenditure of energy\r\nin remembering and synthesizing them into a whole. This energy, since\r\nit is evoked by the line and is not connected with any definite inner\r\nstriving of the self, is felt by us to belong to the line, to be an\r\nelement in its life, as clearly its own as its shape. For example, a\r\nline with many sudden turns or changes of direction is an energetic\r\nand exciting line because it demands in perception a constant and\r\ndifficult and shifting attention; a straight line, on the contrary,\r\nbecause simple and unvarying in its demands upon the attention, is\r\nmonotonous and reposeful; while the curved line, with its lawful and\r\ncontinuous changes, at once stimulating yet never distracting attention,\r\npossesses the character of progressive and happy action. This, the\r\nprimary source of the vital interpretation of lines is supplemented\r\nby elements derived from association. Lines suggest to us the movements\r\nof our bodies along paths of similar form, and we interpret them\r\naccording to the feeling of these movements; in the imagination, we\r\nmay seem to move along the very lines themselves as paths. Every skater\r\nor runner knows the difficulty of moving along a path full of sudden\r\nturns and angles, a difficulty which, if he is in good trim, may\r\nnevertheless afford him pleasure in the overcoming; the delightful and\r\nvarious ease of moving along curved lines; the monotony of a long,\r\nstraight path, but the quick triumph of going right to the end along\r\na short and terminal line of this character. But lines suggest to us\r\nnot only the movements, but also the attitudes of our bodies. They may\r\nbe straight and rising,--rigid or dignified or joyously expanding;\r\nthey may be horizontal and lie down and rest; they may be falling and\r\nsorrowful; or the shapes whose outlines they form may be heavy or\r\nlight, delicate or ungainly or graceful, as bodies are. Finally, the\r\ninterpretation of lines may be further enriched as follows: The sight\r\nof a line suggests the drawing of it, the sweep of the brush that made\r\nit; we ourselves, in the imagination once more, may re-create the line\r\nafter the artist, and feel, just as he must have felt, the mastery,\r\nease, vigor, or delicacy of the execution into the line itself. Few\r\ncan fail to get this effect from the paintings of Franz Hals, for\r\nexample, where the abounding energy of the artist is apparent in each\r\nstroke of the brush. Artists feel this life in execution most strongly;\r\nyet, since almost every one has had some practice in drawing lines,\r\nit is potentially a universal quality in a painting.\r\n\r\nLines may be unified according to the three modes of harmony, balance,\r\nand evolution. The repetition of the same kind of line confers a\r\nharmonious unification upon a drawing, as in Tintoretto's \"Bacchus and\r\nAriadne,\" where the circle is to be found repeated in the crown and\r\nring, in the heads of the three figures, in the breasts of Ariadne.\r\nSimilar to this sameness of form is sameness of direction or parallelism\r\nof lines. Another kind of harmonious unification of lines is continuity,\r\nwhere out of different lines or shapes a single line is made. The\r\nclassical geometrical forms of composition, as the circular or\r\npyramidal, are good examples of this. The \"Odalisque\" of Ingres, where\r\nall the lines of the body constitute a single line, is a notable case.\r\nWhat Ruskin has called \"the approach, intersection, interweaving of\r\nlines, like the sea waves on the shore,\"--the conspiracy of all the\r\nlines in a drawing to form one single network, of which illustrations\r\ncould be found in the work of every draftsman, is a kind of harmony\r\nof line. Symmetrically disposed shapes, and lines whose directions are\r\nopposed, have the balanced form of unity. Here, from a given point as\r\ncenter, the attention is drawn in contrary yet equal ways. Examples\r\nof this type of composition are abundant among the Old Masters; as a\r\nrigid form it is, however, disappearing. That the dramatic type of\r\nunity is to be found in lines will be confirmed by every one who has\r\nobserved the movement, the career of lines. Whenever shapes are so\r\ndisposed that they form a line leading up to a given shape, wherever,\r\nagain, lines converge to a single point, there is a clear case of\r\nevolution; we begin by attending to the line at a certain point, proceed\r\nin a certain direction, then reach a terminal point, the goal of the\r\nprocess. In Leonardo's \"Last Supper,\" the convergence of the perspective\r\nlines and the lines formed by the groups of Apostles is a case of\r\nevolution. The different types of unification are, of course, not\r\nexclusive. In the painting just referred to, all three are present:\r\nChrist and the Apostles are arranged along a single line, the two ends\r\nof which, despite their symmetrical and balanced disposition, converge\r\nto one central point, the Christ. Every pyramidal form of composition\r\nis a combination of balance between the elements at the bases of the\r\ntriangle, convergence towards the apex, and harmony through the\r\nparticipation of the three elements in a single form. One of the most\r\ninteresting and complex types of organization of lines is rhythm--the\r\nbalanced, harmonious movement of lines. A line is rhythmical when there\r\nis a balanced alternation of direction in its movement, a turning now\r\nto the right and now to the left, or vice versa; proportion in the\r\nlength of the segments made by the turns; and general direction--a\r\ntending somewhere.\r\n\r\nAs is assumed in the preceding paragraph, the elements of lines may\r\nbe shapes or masses, as well as points. That is, not only do lines\r\nmade up of points form shapes, but shapes in their turn, when arranged\r\non a surface, necessarily make lines. Such lines are, as a rule, not\r\ncontinuous; yet since the eye takes the shapes successively and in a\r\ngiven direction, they are nevertheless true lines and possess the\r\nqualities of ordinary simple lines. The arrangement of masses in an\r\nundulating line, say in a landscape painting, has essentially the same\r\nvalue for feeling as a similar continuous line; compare this with a\r\nhorizontal arrangement of masses, which has all the quiet and repose\r\nof a simple horizontal line.\r\n\r\nColors and lines, relying on the direct expressiveness which we have\r\nbeen studying, may stand by themselves, as in an oriental rug; yet in\r\npainting they have another function: to represent. And even in the\r\npurely ornamental use of color and line, the tendency towards\r\nrepresentation is apparent everywhere; either the lines are derivatives\r\nof schematized pictures of men and plants and animals, or else such\r\nobjects are introduced as motives without disguise. In painting,\r\ntherefore, the color red has value not only as so much red, but as\r\nstanding for the red of a girl's lips or cheeks; and that curved line\r\nis of significance, not as mere line alone, but as the curve of her\r\nlimbs. In this way the native value of the sense symbols becomes\r\nsuffused and enriched with the values of the things they represent.\r\nThe two functions of color and of line should never be indifferent to\r\neach other; representation should not become a mere excuse for\r\ndecoration, the objects represented having no value in themselves; nor\r\nshould color and line be used as mere signs of interesting objects,\r\nwithout reference to their intrinsic value. On the contrary, the two\r\nfunctions should play into each other's hands. If, for example, the\r\nhuman body is represented, the colors and lines employed should be so\r\ndisposed that they decorate the surface of the picture and hold us\r\nthere through their sheer rhythm and quality; yet, at the same time,\r\nand through their very ornamental power, they should make us feel the\r\nmore keenly the values of the object they represent. Between the\r\nimmediate values of the colors and lines there should exist unity:\r\nstimulating colors should go with stimulating lines, quiet colors with\r\nquiet lines; and the resulting feeling tone of the medium should be\r\nin harmony with the feeling of the objects represented; the one should\r\ngive the other over again, and so each enforce the other.\r\n\r\nSince it is not the purpose of any art to represent mere things, but\r\nto express concrete \"states of the soul,\" the center of which is always\r\nsome feeling, exact fidelity in the representation of objects is not\r\nnecessary for good painting or drawing. Only so much of things needs\r\nto be represented as is necessary to give back the life of them.\r\nNecessary above all is the object as a whole, for to this our feelings\r\nare attached; now this can usually be far better represented through\r\nan impressionistic sketch, which gives only the significant features,\r\nthan by a painstaking and detailed drawing. Since, furthermore, the\r\nlife of things can be conveyed through color and line as such, a certain\r\ndeparture from realism is legitimate for this end. Without some freedom\r\nfrom the exact truth of the colors and lines of things, the artist is\r\nunable to choose and compose them for expressive purposes; when exactly\r\nlike the objects which they represent, they tend to lose all expressive\r\npower of their own, becoming mere signs or equivalents of things. A\r\ncertain amount of variation from the normal may be necessary in order\r\nthat the sense symbols shall call attention to themselves, in order\r\nthat we be prevented, as we are not in the ordinary observation of\r\nnature, from looking through them to the things which they mean.\r\nWhenever, moreover, the artist wishes to render a unique reaction to\r\na scene, he can do so only through a courageous use of the subtle\r\nlanguage of color and line, which may require a distortion of the\r\n\"real\" local qualities of things; for, if he makes a plain, realistic\r\ncopy of the scene itself, he can evoke, and so express, only the normal\r\nemotional responses to it.\r\n\r\nWhen such departures from the truth of things are properly motivated,\r\nno one can be offended by them, any more than when the brilliant hues\r\nof nature appear black and white in a charcoal drawing. The amount of\r\nrealism in any work of art is largely a matter of tacit convention.\r\nAn artist may, if he wishes, use color with no pretense at giving back\r\nthe real colors of objects, but for purely expressive purposes alone,\r\nrelying on line for purposes of representation. This is often done in\r\nJapanese prints. All that is necessary is that we should understand\r\nwhat the artist is doing and find what he presents to us real and\r\nalive. On the other hand, an expressive use of color and line leading\r\nto a distortion of objects out of all possibility of recognition, or\r\neven a use which makes them seem unreal and awry, is without excuse.\r\nFor since colors and lines are employed to bring things before the\r\nimagination, they should be made to serve this purpose successfully;\r\nthe value which belongs to the things should have a chance to appear;\r\nbut this can happen only if they seem to be actually present before\r\nus. Painting is not a mere music of color and line expressive of\r\nabstract and objectless emotions alone, but a poetry, which, through\r\nthe picturing of objects to which emotions are attached, renders the\r\nlatter concrete and definite. Not mere feeling, such as a color or a\r\nline by itself can convey, but feeling in the presence of nature, which\r\ncan be expressed only when color and line are made into a recognizable\r\nimage of nature, is the substance of painting. One cannot express the\r\nfeeling of the weight and bulk of objects, of their distribution in\r\nthree dimensions, or the value of their shadows or atmospheric\r\nenveloping, without the representation of weight and bulk and shadow\r\nand atmosphere and perspective. Every increase in the power to represent\r\nnature, every advance in the mastery of the object, adds a new power\r\nover the expression of feeling, which varies with the object. The\r\nrealist is, therefore, right in his demand that nature itself be\r\npainted; only he should remember that the nature which presents itself\r\nin art is never the naked object, but veiled in feeling; and, as so\r\nveiled, may sometimes be seen pretty much as it really is; then again\r\nwith parts concealed, and sometimes even transformed. Both a realism\r\nthat tries to unite fidelity to the full qualities of the object with\r\nmusical expression in the medium, and so to render the more typical\r\nresponses to nature, which depend, for the most part, on the object\r\nitself, and a symbolism or expressionism that sacrifices fidelity for\r\nthe expression, through the mere medium, of more personal responses,\r\nare in their rights. Only the limits of both tendencies are\r\nillegitimate--the use of color and line to produce mere images of\r\nthings on the one hand, or purely musical effects on the other.\r\n\r\nThe subject matter or content of painting is determined by its language,\r\ncolor, and line. These, as we have seen, by an imitation more or less\r\nexact, represent nature, the world of concrete things as directly\r\npresented to us in vision, colored and shapely. The inner world is\r\nexpressed only so far as it is revealed in the gestures and attitudes\r\nof the bodies of men or so far as it is a mood attached to things and\r\ntheir colors and shapes. Now space is the universal container in which\r\nall elements of the visible world are disposed. Every painting,\r\ntherefore, should include a representation of space; it should never\r\nrepresent things as if they stood alone without environment or relation.\r\nEven in the portrait of a single individual some relation to space\r\nshould be indicated; this is accomplished by the background, in which\r\nthe figures should be made to lie, and to which they should seem to\r\nbelong. In front, the space of a picture is limited by the plane of\r\nthe surface on which it is painted; everything should appear to belong\r\nin the space back of this; nothing should seem to come forward out\r\ntowards the spectator. But behind this, backwards, the space represented\r\nis unlimited, and its infinite depths may well be indicated by the\r\nconvergence of perspective lines and the gradual fading of the outlines\r\nand colors of objects.\r\n\r\nThe represented space of the picture is not, of course, the real space\r\nof the canvas or of the room in which the picture hangs. The former\r\nis infinite, while the latter is only so many square feet in area. The\r\nframe serves the purpose of cutting off the represented space from all\r\nrelation to the real space, of which the frame itself is a part. A\r\nconfusion of these two spaces is sometimes found in crude work and in\r\nthe comments of people upon genuine works of art. I have, for example,\r\nseen a picture of a lion with iron bars riveted to the frame and\r\nextending over it,--a represented lion in a real cage! And I once heard\r\na man criticise one of Degas' paintings on the ground that \"if the\r\ndancing girl were to straighten her bent body she would bump her head\r\non the frame!\" The rule that the color of the frame should harmonize\r\nwith the main tones of the picture is no proof that they belong\r\ntogether; its purpose is merely to protect the colors of the painting\r\nfrom being changed through their neighborhood with those of the frame.\r\n\r\nAlthough painting is essentially a spatial art, it includes a temporal\r\nelement, the \"specious present,\" the single moment of action or of\r\nmotion. The lines are not dead and static, but alive; they progress\r\nand vibrate; by their means a smile, the rippling of a stream, the\r\ngesture of surprise, the movement of a dance, may be depicted.\r\nSuccessive moments, the different phases of an action or movement,\r\ncannot, however, be represented. Strict unities of space and time\r\nshould be observed in painting. Only contiguous parts of space and\r\nonly one moment of time should be represented inside a single frame.\r\nBoth these unities were violated in old religious paintings where\r\nsometimes the Nativity, Flight into Egypt, Crucifixion, and Resurrection\r\nwere all portrayed on one canvas.\r\n\r\nThe space of painting is no abstract aspect of things such as the\r\ngeometer elaborates. To be in a common space with other things, implies,\r\nfor the pictorial intuition of the world, to be played upon by the\r\nsame light and to be enveloped in the same atmosphere. Space, light,\r\nand air constitute the milieu in which everything lives and moves and\r\nhas its being in painting. To every difference in the arrangement and\r\nforeshortening of objects, to every variation in their lights and\r\nshadows and aerial quality, the sensitive soul responds. The close\r\nproximity of objects in a tiny room has an effect upon feeling very\r\ndifferent from their wide distribution over a broad space. An equal\r\ndifference depends upon whether light is concentrated upon objects or\r\nevenly distributed over them; upon whether it is bright or dim; upon\r\nwhether they are near and clear in a thin air or far and hazy in a\r\nthick and heavy cloud. The masters of light and air, Rembrandt, Claude,\r\nTurner, evoke myriad moods through these subtle influences. A long\r\ndevelopment and the following of many false paths was necessary before\r\npainting discovered its true function as an expression of the elements,\r\nthe once hard outlines of things softening in their enveloping embrace.\r\n\r\nThe representation of space, which painting alone of all the arts can\r\nachieve, does not imply, however, a representation of the full plastic\r\nquality of individual objects, which is the function of sculpture.\r\nThis, to be sure, can be done in painting, as the great\r\nsculptor-painters of the Renaissance have shown; but it cannot be done\r\nso well as in sculpture; and when done tends to interfere with other\r\nthings. It makes objects stand out too much by themselves, destroying\r\ntheir felt unity with other elements on the canvas, so that when\r\nprovided with all the colors of life, they seem rather real than\r\npainted, and look as if they wished to leave the world of\r\nrepresentation, where they belong, and touch hands with the spectator.\r\nThe depth and the extent of space, the distance and the distribution\r\nof objects, light and shade and air, are all independent of the\r\nplasticity of individual things, which tends to disappear in proportion\r\nas they are emphasized. Only when attention is directed to the\r\nindividual object does its full plasticity appear; see it as an element\r\nof the environing whole, and it flattens out to view.\r\n\r\nThere are, in fact, two ways of seeing, to each of which corresponds\r\na mode of painting. On the one hand, we may see distributively, holding\r\nobjects as individuals each in our attention, neglecting light and\r\nspace and air. Or else we may see synthetically, first the whole which\r\nlight and space and air compose, and then individual things as bearers\r\nof these. The one is the more practical way of seeing; because, for\r\npractical purposes, the separate thing that can be grasped and used\r\nis all important, and the film of light and air and the neighborhood\r\nof other things are of no account. The other is more theoretical and\r\nsthetic; for to a pure vision which does not think of handling, there\r\nare no separate things, but only differences of shape and color and\r\nlocation in a single object, the visible whole.

Lipps,\r\n_Aesthetik_, Bd. 2, s. 165, et seq.]\r\n\r\nIn the type of painting corresponding to the first way of seeing,\r\nobjects are represented more as we think them to be, or as we should\r\nfind them on further exploration, than as they actually appear to sight\r\nat any given moment; the outlines are clear and sharp and detail is\r\nemphasized. This mode of painting is most in place for interiors where\r\nthere is an even distribution and no striking effects of light and\r\nshade, as in so many genre pictures of the Dutch school; but above all\r\nwhen the human significance of objects or their dramatic relations,\r\nwhich depend upon their being taken as separate things, is to be\r\nexpressed. For example, to get the expression of the action of a woman\r\npouring water into a jug, it is necessary that we feel the shape and\r\ncolor of the latter as aspects of a tangible reality having a distinct\r\npurpose, that of holding water; and this purposefulness makes of the\r\nobject a separate, individual thing. Yet a too great distinction of\r\nobjects and a too great elaboration of detail, as in Meissonier and\r\nthe English Pre-Raphaelites, is inartistic; the picture breaks up into\r\nseparate parts and all feeling of unity is lost. In the work of the\r\nFlemish and Dutch, on the contrary, we take delight in the perspicuity\r\nof things without losing the sense of wholeness; for there is a sameness\r\nand simplicity of color tone which unites them. A genuine and unique\r\nsthetic value is possessed by such work,--that of clear intuition of\r\nthe visual detail and human significance of things.\r\n\r\nVery often the unification in painting of this type is dramatic\r\nchiefly--some link of action or of symbolism which the elements of\r\nthe picture have as meanings, a unity of content, therefore, and not\r\na coloristic or a linear unity. The colors are essentially local colors,\r\nserving first to characterize and distinguish the objects properly,\r\nand then to lend to them severally high value through brightness and\r\ntemperament; although harmonizing as mere colors, they are held together\r\nmore through some connection in what they mean than through a unity\r\nof pure expression. The dominance of any one mass, too, depends more\r\nupon its superior significance as meaning than upon its claim upon the\r\nattention through any intrinsic quality of color. Nevertheless, even\r\nif secondary, the unity and dominance through color and line must be\r\npresent, and should be consonant with the unity and subordination in\r\nthe meanings. The painting of the great Italian masters was of this\r\ncharacter. In a Madonna picture, for example, the elements representing\r\nthe Holy Family are united through the spiritual oneness of the objects\r\nwhich they represent, and the Madonna is dominant through her superior\r\nsignificance for the religious life. The colors serve to characterize\r\nand distinguish the figures; yet between the former there is a harmony\r\ncorresponding to the inner harmony of the latter; the spiritual\r\ndominance of the Madonna is expressed in a purely formal fashion through\r\nher larger size, central position, and more brightly gleaming garments.\r\n\r\nIn painting which corresponds to the synthetic way of seeing, all\r\nparticular objects are subordinated to space and light and air; their\r\noutlines are melting, suggested rather than seen, and there is little\r\nemphasis on detail. Turner's painting of light and the more recent\r\nexamples of impressionism afford abundant examples of this. In this\r\nstyle, unification is effected almost wholly through color and line\r\nas such, and through the light and space and air which they represent.\r\nJust to live in the same atmosphere or in the path of the same light,\r\nto be enveloped in the same darkness or shadow, or merely to participate\r\nin a single composition of colors or rhythm of lines serves to unite\r\nobjects. The relative importance of elements, too, is determined rather\r\nby some intrinsic quality which arrests attention than by any supremacy\r\nas meanings.\r\n\r\nThrough such materials and methods as we have described, the\r\npossibilities and limits of expression in painting are determined.\r\nFirst of all, painting has the power, through color and line as such,\r\nto express the purely musical emotions; this we demand of painting\r\njust as we demand music of verse: without word-music, there is no\r\npoetry, no matter how high the theme; so without color and line music,\r\nno matter how skillful the representation or how noble the subject,\r\nthere is no picture. Painting may give little more than this. In much\r\nof still-life painting, for example, the values attached to the objects\r\nrepresented are borrowed from the music of the medium. And even when\r\nthe objects represented have a value in themselves, the superiority\r\nof their representation over the mere perception of them in nature\r\ncomes from this source. Why, for example, does the painting of flowers\r\nby a real master afford a richer aesthetic experience than real flowers?\r\nPainted flowers have no perfume, rightly called the soul of flowers.\r\nIt is because in painting the expressiveness of the purer and more\r\nsubtly harmonious colors more than compensates for the lack of odor.\r\nThrough the music of color and line we are made responsive to common\r\nthings which otherwise would leave us cold, or if we are responsive\r\nto them, our sensitiveness becomes finer and keener. It is largely\r\nbecause he is so accomplished a musician in color and composition that\r\nJan Vermeer can make the inside of a room or some commonplace act by\r\na commonplace person the object of an intense and sympathetic\r\ncontemplation.\r\n\r\nFor the beauty of landscape also, which the art of painting has created\r\nand which during the last century has become its favorite theme, the\r\nmusic of color is equally essential. In its highest form, that beauty\r\nrequires emotional responsiveness combined with the power accurately\r\nto observe and reproduce the qualities of things; without observation\r\nand reproduction, the feeling is incommunicable; without feeling, the\r\nimitation is lifeless. Love of the object, which at once reveals and\r\nmakes responsive, mediates the highest achievements of the art. By\r\ntranslating the object into the language of abstract color and line,\r\nit is purified for feeling; for those qualities toward which feeling\r\nis indifferent are eliminated; only so much as can enter into an\r\nexpressive color or line composition survives. The artist gives us the\r\nillusion that he is reproducing our familiar world all the while that\r\nhe is glorifying it through the beauty of the colors in which he paints\r\nit. The painting of the human body, especially the nude human body,\r\nbelongs to the same class of subjects as the painting of landscapes.\r\nFor the human body unclothed, and as unclothed severed from the\r\nconventional social world, is a part of nature and speaks to us as\r\nnature does through form and color. To bring that object before us\r\nwith all its expressive detail; to make us, in the imagination, move\r\nwith it and touch it; to caress it with our eyes; to awaken that\r\npassionate interest which makes us see and feel it more vividly than\r\nanything else in the world, yet to subdue passion wholly to a glowing\r\ncontemplation, this is one of the highest achievements of pictorial\r\nart. And the artistic right to represent it in the woods by lake or\r\nstream, or in the meadow among other natural things, must be accorded\r\nto the artist despite all protests of convention and habit; we never\r\nactually find it there, to be sure, yet there it belongs for imaginative\r\nfeelings. The maidens in Corot's paintings, for example, seem to belong\r\nas naturally to the landscape as the very trees themselves.\r\n\r\nBut the painter can depict the human body not merely as something\r\nsensuously beautiful, but as expressive, through gesture and pose and\r\ncountenance, of character and thought. The complex psychic life of man\r\nis thus open to him for delineation. In the portrait, through the\r\nattentive study of the many varying expressions of the inner life,\r\nleading to the selection of some characteristic pose or action, the\r\nartist concentrates into a single image what seems to him to be the\r\ndistinctive nature of the man. And he can express this nature over\r\nagain, and so more effectively reveal it, in the mere colors and lines\r\nwhich he uses. Thus Franz Hals has embodied the abundance and good\r\ncheer of his burghers in the boldness and brightness of the lines and\r\ncolors with which he paints them; and Hogarth, in the \"Shrimp Girl,\"\r\nthrough the mere singularity of line and color, has created the eerie\r\nimpression which we attach to the girl herself. The best portraits\r\nsubordinate everything else, such as costume and background, to the\r\npainting of the inner life. Thus Velasquez brings before us the souls\r\nof his little Infantas despite the queer head-dresses and frocks which\r\nmust have threatened to smother them. The background should serve the\r\nsame end; if elaborate, it should represent a fitting environment; and\r\nif plain it should throw the figure into relief. Alongside of the\r\nportrait as a painting of the soul should be placed pictures of ideal\r\ncharacters; ideal, not in the sense of good, but in the sense of more\r\nhighly complex and unified than actually existing persons. Such pictures\r\nsymbolize for us the quintessence and highest level of definite types\r\nof life. Manet's \"Olympia\" and Goya's \"Maja\" belong here equally with\r\nLeonardo's \"Christ\" or \"Mona Lisa,\" with Raphael's Madonnas and\r\nMichelangelo's gods and angels. In them is attained the most intense\r\nconcentration of psychic life possible.\r\n\r\nIt is now pretty generally recognized that the unities of time and\r\nspace exclude from the sphere of painting story telling and history,\r\nwhich require for effective representation more than the single moment\r\nincluded in painting. In order to tell a story in painting, one has\r\nto supplement what is seen with ideas which can be obtained only from\r\na catalogue or other source external to the picture; one has to add\r\nin thought to the moment given on the canvas the missing moments of\r\nthe action. But a work of art should be complete in itself and so far\r\nas possible self-explanatory; it should not lead us away from itself,\r\nbut keep us always to itself. If the scene represented be a part of\r\na story, the story should be so well known that its connection with\r\nthe picture can be immediately recognized without external aid, and\r\nshould admit of a certain completeness in its various parts. The life\r\nof Christ is such a story; everybody knows it and can interpret a\r\npicture portraying it forthwith; its various incidents and situations\r\nhave each a unique and complete significance in themselves. Historical\r\npaintings are not necessarily bad, of course, but the good ones are\r\ngood despite the history, and a proof of their excellence consists in\r\nthe fact that when we see them they make us forget for the moment our\r\nhistorical erudition.\r\n\r\nThis norm does not exclude from the sphere of painting the expression\r\nof the relation of man to his fellows; it simply confines painting to\r\nthe delineation of momentary and self-sufficient glimpses of social\r\nlife. Pictures representing a mother and child, a pair of lovers, a\r\nfamily group, festival, tavern scene, or battle charge are\r\nillustrations. In Dutch painting the social life of Holland in the\r\nseventeenth century found its record; yet there is little or no\r\nanecdote. The genre, the representation of a group of people united\r\nby some common interest and with an appropriate background, has the\r\nsame legitimacy, if not the same eminence, as the portrait. It does\r\nnot possess the rank of the portrait because, since the interest is\r\nrather in the action or the situation portrayed, the figures are more\r\nmerely typical, being developed only so far as is necessary to carry\r\nthe action; seldom is a subtle and individualized inner life portrayed.\r\n\r\nObjections are rightly raised, however, against pathetic, sentimental,\r\nand moralistic painting. Here color and line, the whole picture in\r\nfact, counts for little or nothing except to stir an emotion, usually\r\nof grief or pity or love, or to preach a sermon; the unity of form and\r\ncontent is sacrificed, the one becoming a mere means to the other.\r\nBut, as we know, it is never the purpose of art merely to stir feeling;\r\nits purpose is to objectify feeling; if the art be painting, to put\r\nfeeling into color and line, and only when feeling is experienced as\r\n_there_ is it aesthetic feeling at all. And what shall we think\r\nof a picture like the \"Doctor\" of Luke Fildes', which is so pathetic\r\nthat one cannot bear to look at it? Surely a picture should make one\r\nwant to see it! Of course I do not mean that an artist cannot paint\r\npathetic and sentimental subjects. The great painters of the Passion\r\nwould disprove that with reference to the former and Watteau with\r\nreference to the latter. But a power to achieve beauty of color and\r\nline and to objectify pathos and sentiment through them was possessed\r\nby these painters to a degree to which few others have attained. For\r\nmoralistic painting, however, there can be no excuse. You can paint\r\nvisible things and as much of the soul as can appear through them; you\r\ncannot paint abstract ethical maxims. Of course a painter may intend\r\nhis picture to be an illustration of some moral maxim, or may even,\r\nas Hogarth did, paint it to expose the sins of his age and create a\r\nbeautiful work notwithstanding; but only if, in the result, this purpose\r\nis irrelevant and the concrete delineation everything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nSCULPTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sculptor has this advantage over all other artists, that his chief\r\nsubject is the most beautiful thing in the world--the human body. In\r\ntwo ways the body is supremely beautiful: as an expression of mind and\r\nas an embodiment of sensuous charm. In the body mind has become actually\r\nincarnate; there purpose, emotion, and thought have taken shape and\r\nmanifestation. And this shape, through its appeal to the amorous,\r\nparental, and gregarious feelings, and through the complete organization\r\nof its parts, has no rival in loveliness. What wonder, therefore, that\r\nsculptors have always thought of their work as simply one of mere\r\nimitation of nature, the divine. Yet in sculpture, as in the other\r\narts, the imitative process is never slavish, but selective and\r\ninventive. For the body is interesting to the artist only in so far\r\nas it is beautiful, that is, so far as it has charm and exhibits the\r\ncontrol of mind; some of its details and many of its attitudes, having\r\nno relation to either, are unfit for imitation; and, although inspired\r\nby his model, the sculptor seeks to create out of his impressions a\r\nstill more harmonious object.\r\n\r\nTo give to his material the semblance of the body beautiful is the\r\ntechnical problem of the sculptor. Although this semblance is primarily\r\nfor sight, it is not exclusively so. For in sculpture shape is not\r\ntwo-dimensional, but plastic; and for the full appreciation of\r\nplasticity, the cooperation of touch is required. Moreover, not only\r\nthe perception of the form, but also a large part of the appreciation\r\nof the charm of the body depends upon touch. Of course we do not\r\nordinarily touch statues, but they should make us want to touch them,\r\nand we should touch them--in the imagination. The surfaces of the\r\nstatue should therefore be so modeled as to give us, in the imagination,\r\nthe pleasures that we get when we touch the living body. It is well\r\nknown that these touch values were destroyed by the neo-classicists\r\nwhen they polished the surfaces of their statues. Such sculpture for\r\nthe eye only is almost as good when reproduced in an engraving that\r\npreserves its visual quality, and is therefore lacking in complete\r\nsculptural beauty. But no plane reproduction can replace the best\r\nGreek, Italian, or French work.\r\n\r\nThe life of the statue should, however, be more than skin deep. We\r\nshould appreciate it through sensations of motion and strain as well\r\nas through sight and touch, feeling the tenseness or relaxation of the\r\nmuscles and tendons beneath. We should move with its motion or rest\r\nwith its repose. And this does not mean that we should merely know\r\nthat an attitude of quiet or of motion is represented; we should\r\nactually experience quiet or motion. In our own bodies sensations\r\ncorresponding to these should be awakened by the visual image of the\r\nstatue, yet should be fused with the latter, becoming for our perception\r\nits, not ours, in accordance with the mechanism of _einfuhlung_\r\ndescribed in our fourth chapter. The light rhythmic motion of the\r\nfigures in Carpeaux's \"Dance\" should thrill in our own limbs, yet seem\r\nto thrill in theirs.\r\n\r\nBecause it preserves the full three-dimensional presence of the body,\r\nsculpture is, next to the drama, the most realistic of the arts. This\r\nrealism is not, however, an unmixed advantage for general appreciation.\r\nFor, finding the shape of the body, men sometimes demand its color and\r\nlife, complaining that the statue is cold and dead;[Footnote: See\r\nByron, _Don Juan_, Canto II, cxviii.] or else, giving life to the\r\nform, they react to it practically and socially, as they would toward\r\nthe real body. Yet, for the one attitude, the art itself cannot be\r\nheld responsible, but rather some want of genius in the artist or lack\r\nof imagination in the spectator; and as for the other, although only\r\na bloodless dogma would demand the elimination of passion and interest\r\nfrom the appreciation of sculpture--for unless the marble arouse the\r\nnatural feelings toward the body it is no successful\r\nexpression--nevertheless, good taste does demand that, through attention\r\nto form and a sense of the unreality of the object, these feelings be\r\nsubdued to contemplation.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep the statue on the ideal plane, it should not be too\r\nrealistically fashioned. If it looks too much like a man, we shall\r\nfirst treat it as a man, as we do one of Jarley's or Mme. Tissaud's\r\nwaxworks, and then after we have been undeceived, we shall have toward\r\nit an uncanny feeling, totally unaesthetic, as towards a corpse. The\r\nstatue, therefore, if life-sized, should not be given the colors or\r\nclothing of life. Tinting is not excluded, provided no attempt is made\r\nat exact imitation; and when the statue is of heroic, or less than the\r\nnormal size, as in porcelain, both coloring and clothing may be more\r\nrealistic. No hard and fast rules can be formulated; yet the principle\r\nis plain--there should be realism in one aspect, above all in shape,\r\nin order that there may be an aesthetic semblance of life, but not in\r\nall, in order that the statue may not be a mere substitute for life,\r\nawakening the reactions appropriate to life. Moreover, appreciating\r\nthe beauty of his material, the sculptor may not wish to cover it up,\r\nas he would if he tinted it. As in painting, the attainment of beauty\r\nin the medium may interfere with full realism in execution. For the\r\nsake of beauty of color, the worker in bronze will be content to see\r\nthe white man black, and for the sake of beauty of line he may even\r\nsacrifice something of exactness in the rendering of shape.\r\n\r\nFor there is a beauty in the media of sculpture, apart from what they\r\nmay represent, quite as real, if not as obvious, as in the other arts.\r\nAnd without this beauty, there is no artistic sculpture. Its subtlety\r\ndoes not diminish its importance or its effect upon our feeling, for\r\nit makes all the difference between a mere imitation of nature and a\r\nwork of art charming and compelling. We do not need to recognize its\r\nexistence explicitly in order to appreciate it; yet, as soon as our\r\nattention is called to it, we admit it and accord to it that rare\r\ninfluence which before was felt but nameless.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the color of the material is expressive. The black\r\nand gold of bronze have a depth and intensity, the whiteness of marble\r\na coldness, clarity, and, serenity, inescapable. The weight and\r\nhardness, or lightness and softness, of the material, also count. If\r\npeople do not feel the expressiveness of these qualities directly,\r\nthey nevertheless do feel it indirectly, whenever they appreciate the\r\nsuperior fitness of marble and bronze for the embodiment of the heroic\r\nand supernatural, and of the light and fragile porcelain for the more\r\nfleeting and trivial phases of life. Size, too, is expressive. There\r\nis a daintiness and tenderness about a little statue, contrasting\r\nstrongly with the grandeur and majesty of one of heroic size. The usual\r\nsmall size of the terra cotta figurines among the Greeks was appropriate\r\nfor the genre subjects which they so frequently represented, and an\r\nAphrodite in this material is rather the Earthly than the Heavenly\r\nLove.\r\n\r\nThere is also an evident beauty of line in sculpture, similar to the\r\nbeauty of line in painting. The curved line is expressive of movement\r\nand grace; the horizontal, of repose; the crooked line, of energy and\r\nconflict. Compare, from this point of view, Rodin's \"The Aged Helmet-\r\nMaker's Wife\" with his \"Danaid,\"--how expressive of struggle and\r\nsuffering are the uneven lines of the former, how voluptuous the curves\r\nof the latter! Michelangelo is the great example of the use of tortuous\r\nlines for the expression of conflict. Undulating vertical lines are\r\nlargely responsible for the \"grace and dignity\" of the classic\r\nsculpture.\r\n\r\nThere is an organic unity of line in sculpture, similar again to that\r\nin painting. And by line I mean not only surface lines, but the lines\r\nmade by the planes in which the body lies, the lines of pose and\r\nattitude. The predominance of a single type of line, the union of many\r\nlines to form a single continuous line, balance and symmetry of line,\r\nproportion of length and parallelism, are all to be found in sculpture.\r\nEspecially important is rhythm--the harmonious, balanced movement of\r\nlines. In the \"Venus de Milo,\" for example, the plane of the lower\r\nlimbs from the feet to the knees moves to the left; there is an opposite\r\nand balancing movement from the right knee to the waist; the first\r\nmovement is repeated in the parallel line from the right hip to the\r\ntop of the head; this, in turn, is balanced by a line in the opposite\r\ndirection running from the left hip to the right shoulder, parallel\r\nto the second line; but the equilibrium of line is not a rigid one,\r\nfor the body as a whole moves in an undulating line to the left,\r\nimparting grace and a total unity.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of line in sculpture is, of course, no invention of the\r\nartist; for nature has created it in the body itself. The sculptor\r\ntakes this beauty as the basis of his work, remodeling only by the\r\nelimination of details, through which purer effects of line are\r\nobtained, or by the selection and emphasis of pose, through which these\r\neffects are rendered more intensely expressive. All conventionalization\r\nis in the interest of increased beauty of line. But too great a\r\nsacrifice of the natural contours of the body, as in some of the work\r\nof the Cubists, results in a lifelessness that cannot be atoned for\r\nby any formal beauty.\r\n\r\nThe unification of line in sculpture is a matter not only of lines\r\nwithin the whole and of single contours, but of the total visual form\r\nof the whole, of silhouette. Although three-dimensional, every statue\r\ncasts a two-dimensional image on the retina. It makes as many of these\r\nplane pictures as there are points of view from which it can be seen.\r\nOne can easily convince oneself of this by viewing a statue from a\r\ndistance, when it will flatten out to a mere outline or silhouette.\r\nAs such, it should be clear and simple and pleasing, capable of being\r\ngrasped as a whole irrespective of detail. Michelangelo demanded that\r\nevery statue be capable of being put inside of some simple geometrical\r\nfigure, like a pyramid or a cube; that there be no wayward arms or\r\nlegs, but close attachment to the body, so close that the statue might\r\nbe rolled down hill without any part being broken off. This last is\r\nperhaps too rigorous a requirement, but the best work of all periods\r\nexhibits visual clarity and concentration.[Footnote: Compare Adolf\r\nHildebrand, The Problem of Form in Painting and Sculpture.]\r\n\r\nWithin its contours the statue stands alone. This is the essential\r\ndifference between painting and sculpture; the painted thing is always\r\na part of a larger spatial whole within which it exists in relation\r\nto other things, while the sculptured thing exists by itself; the space\r\nof the statue is the space which it fills; there is no further space\r\nto which it belongs, no background in which it lies. The space of\r\nsculpture, like the space of painting, is of course a represented or\r\nimaginary space, to be carefully distinguished from the real space of\r\nthe room in which it is placed and the floor upon which it stands. The\r\npedestal serves the same purpose in sculpture as the frame in the\r\nsister art; it cuts off the ideal space which the statue fills from\r\nthe real space where it is housed, raising it above the common ground\r\nof real life, with its practical and social attitudes, into the realm\r\nof contemplation. The pedestal should be of a different material from\r\nthe statue, else it belongs with the latter, and fails to perform its\r\nseparating junction. The plate, on the other hand, should be of the\r\nsame material, otherwise the statue would be made to stand on our\r\nearth, and in the same space with us.\r\n\r\nHowever, just as in painting every object should be represented as\r\nbelonging to a wider whole of space, so in sculpture, every part of\r\nthe body should be represented as belonging to the whole body. If,\r\ntherefore, only a part of the body is sculptured, it should be evident\r\nthat it is a part and not the whole. In the portrait statue, for\r\nexample, if the head alone is represented, there should appear, along\r\nwith the head, as much of the bust as will suggest attachment to the\r\nbody, in order that it may not seem decapitated! It is because the\r\ntorso is so obviously a fragment of an ideal whole that we do not feel\r\nit to be an uncanny mutilation of a man or woman. In its present\r\ncondition, the \"Venus de Milo\" is not the statue of an armless woman,\r\nbut a statue of part of a whole woman.\r\n\r\nA statue is not sufficiently unified by representing a single individual\r\nor several individuals united by some common interest or by\r\nparticipation in some common action; the unity in the object should\r\nbe expressed through a unity in the material of representation. The\r\nfinest taste requires that every statue should be made of only one\r\nkind of material. One part, say the body, should not be of marble, and\r\nanother part, say the girdle, of gold or bronze. Such a combination\r\nof materials gives the impression of two things juxtaposed, not of a\r\nsingle whole. If in defense of this one were to say that through the\r\ndifference of materials real differences in the object are portrayed,\r\nconsistency would require that the principle be carried out, that the\r\nhair be of another material, and the eyes of still a third, with the\r\nresult of making the statue a sheer agglomerate. And when more than\r\none individual is represented, even a unity of material is not\r\nsufficient; it is necessary, in addition, that the several figures in\r\nthe group be in contact with each Other. It is not enough that they\r\nstand on the same plate; for the real empty space that we see between\r\nthem will keep them apart. The ideal space to which they belong, and\r\nthe spiritual or dramatic oneness, should be mediated by a material\r\ntouch of hands or other parts of the body. Compare, in this connection,\r\nRodin's \"Citizens of Calais\" where this principle is violated, with\r\nthe three figures from the summit of his \"Hell Gate,\" where it is\r\nobserved. In the former we simply know that the figures belong together,\r\nbut we do not feel them as together.[Footnote: Compare Lipps,\r\n_Aesthetik_, Bd. 2, Fuenftes Kapitel.]\r\n\r\nIn the normal type of sculpture only one figure is represented. For\r\nthis, there is, perhaps, a chief point of regard, in front, the same\r\nas that which we ordinarily occupy with reference to our fellow men.\r\nYet, since the body is beautiful from every point of view, the statue,\r\nunless designed to fit into a niche, should be so made that we shall\r\nwant to move around it and survey it from every angle. Here is another\r\ndifference between painting and sculpture. In the group, however, where\r\nseveral figures are represented united by some common interest or by\r\nparticipating in some common action, this difference is already\r\nbeginning to disappear. For, in order to appreciate the dramatic\r\nsignificance of the group, the point of regard from in front is\r\nessential. The other aspects remain important for their corporeal\r\nbeauty, but, since that is not ordinarily paired with an equal inner\r\nsignificance, they come to acquire a secondary place.\r\n\r\nImpressionistic sculpture represents a further departure from the\r\nnormal and in the direction of the pictorial. Here part of the block\r\nfrom which the statue has been hewn is left an integral member of the\r\npiece; and out of it the figure seems to grow, as it were. It performs\r\nin the whole a function corresponding to the background of a\r\nportrait--the representation of the environment. Thus, in Meunier's\r\n\"The Miner,\" the block represents the mine; in Rodin's \"Orpheus and\r\nEurydice,\" it represents the mouth of Hades; in his \"Mystery of the\r\nSpring,\" a basin. Through the possibility of thus representing the\r\nrelation of man to his environment a notable extension in the scope\r\nof sculpture is obtained.\r\n\r\nWhen a background is introduced, the figure or figures, being members\r\nof a larger whole, require less detailed treatment, less clearness of\r\noutline. Their parts may even be left in large measure unfinished, the\r\ncontours melting together with the block. A special point of regard,\r\nfrom which alone the figures are modeled, is obviously essential.\r\nStriking is the contrast of this type with the classic, where the\r\nutmost precision in modeling is necessary. Along with the diminished\r\nemphasis on clearness of form goes an increased effort at the portrayal\r\nof the inner, more spiritual life; sentiment and mystery find an\r\nunwonted place in the art. Rodin's \"Psyche\" is a good illustration.\r\nYet, despite these differences, the classic demand for living surfaces,\r\nfor rhythmical lines, for perspicuity and totality of silhouette, for\r\nsingleness and unity of material, abides.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the block attains prominence, the unification of the\r\ndifferent figures through contact is no longer of equal necessity. The\r\nbackground serves the purpose of bringing the figures together, of\r\nproviding a material bond between them. This is especially true in the\r\nvarious kinds of relief, between which and sculpture in the round,\r\nimpressionistic sculpture is a sort of compromise. In relief there may\r\neven be a representation of perspective, the figures seeming to lie\r\nbehind each other, flatter and smaller to indicate distance. But we\r\nshall not enter into the technique of this, which obviously approaches\r\nthat of painting.\r\n\r\nWhen the charm of the body is the prime object of expression, those\r\nactions and poses which exhibit grace and vigor are the ones naturally\r\nchosen. This beauty is best revealed in the single figure, because in\r\nthe group there is usually some dramatic interest which diverts\r\nattention from it. The figure is preferably wholly or partially\r\nundraped, or when drapery is used, it should reveal the body underneath\r\nand possess beauty of line of its own. Elaboration of drapery for its\r\nown sake, or in order to display virtuosity in modeling, shows lack\r\nof true sculptural vision, which always has its eye on the naked form.\r\nAside from lack of charm, the old and crippled are avoided because\r\ntheir inharmonious lines would appear again in a statue which reproduced\r\nthem; it is not possible, as in painting, to make a harmony out of\r\nthem through relation to other lines in the total work, for no other\r\nlines exist; nor can their natural ugliness be so easily made acceptable\r\nthrough beauty of color and light. Nevertheless, no one can dogmatically\r\nassert that the artist must confine himself in his choice of subjects.\r\nIf by harmonizing the distorted lines of an ugly body with each other,\r\nand by enhancing the given purity and expressiveness of his material,\r\nthe artist can create a beauty of form overlying the repellence of the\r\nsubject, and if he can make us feel the tragedy or pathos of age and\r\ndisease, no one can gainsay his work. In his \"Aged Helmet-Maker's\r\nWife,\" Rodin has perhaps accomplished this. [Footnote: See Rodin's own\r\ndefense of this statue in his _L'Art_, chap. II.]\r\n\r\nIn the classic sculpture the expression of the inner life is subordinate\r\nto the expression of corporeal beauty. Or, so far as mind is revealed,\r\nthe revelation occurs through the body as a whole,--through attitude\r\nand pose and act. In this way complete unity between the inner and the\r\nouter beauty is preserved. For when through subtle modeling of the\r\nface the expression of the intense and individualized life of thought\r\nis attempted, the beauties of soul and body tend to fall apart and\r\nbecome rivals for attention. In classic sculpture, therefore, the face\r\nis rightly somewhat inexpressive, or better, is expressive of only the\r\nbroad and typical human emotions. Fine or deep qualities may, however,\r\nbe expressed; for dignity, poise, intelligence, sorrow, and active joy\r\nmake themselves manifest in the total _habitus_ of the body no less than\r\nin the face.\r\n\r\nThe work of Michelangelo is a further proof that sculpture can express\r\nthe spiritual life, not only in the face, but in the body also. The\r\nexpression there is no different in essential kind from that found in\r\nthe heroic classic sculpture. It is universal, typical, not individual,\r\npersonal; of the gods, not of men. Its quality alone differs; it is\r\nmonstrous, pathological, grandiose, instead of serene and happily\r\nbalanced.\r\n\r\nBut sculpture can also portray the individualized psychic life.\r\n[Footnote: Consult the discussion in Rodin's _L'Art_, chap. VII.]\r\nFor this, the portrait bust is the most appropriate medium of\r\nexpression. By separating the head, the natural seat of mind, from the\r\nrest of the body, the rivalry between the beauty of soul and form is\r\nobviated. How much sculpture can do in this way is shown by the work\r\nof the Greeks and Romans in ancient times, and by such men as Houdon\r\nand Rodin among the moderns. Think of the intense and concentrated\r\nexpression of thought and emotion in the \"Voltaire\" of Houdon and the\r\n\"Dalou\" of Rodin! Success depends largely upon the modeling of the\r\nsubtle lines of the face, where the more highly specialized workings\r\nof the mind leave their impress. Whatever of character the face may\r\nexpress can be expressed over again in its image. Of course the unique\r\nresponses of mind to definite situations, such as, for example, the\r\nconversation of a man with his fellows, cannot be portrayed in\r\nsculpture, which isolates the individual. But the characteristic mood\r\nand attitude, the permanent residuum and condition of these responses,\r\ncan be portrayed; and this constitutes personality or character. As\r\nSchopenhauer declared, the character of a man is better revealed in\r\nthe face when he is in repose than when he is responding to other men,\r\nfor there is always a certain amount of dissimulation or insincerity\r\nin social intercourse. The impossibility of rendering the color and\r\nanimation of the eye constitutes a real deficiency, but, as has often\r\nbeen pointed out, this is partly minimized through the fact that the\r\nexpression of the eye depends largely upon the brows; by itself, the\r\neye is inexpressive. The portrait statue has much the same purpose as\r\nthe bust, and hence should be draped. The heroic, equestrian statue,\r\nhowever, expresses rather the imposing, socially perceptible side of\r\nthe man, than the inner life of thought and sentiment revealed in the\r\nbust.\r\n\r\nThe development of sculpture has produced nothing more beautiful than\r\nthe solitaire statues which the Greeks have left us; and when we think\r\nof Greek sculpture we usually have in mind these marble or bronze\r\nimages of gods and heroes. But we should not forget the figurines of\r\nterra cotta, a genre sculpture, representing men and women in the acts\r\nand attitudes of daily life, at work and at play. The ideal of sculpture\r\nshould not be pitched too high. There is no reason why, with the example\r\nset by the Greeks, sculpture should not portray the lighter and more\r\nusual phases of human life. If sculpture is to strike new paths, and\r\nbe something more than a repetition of classical models, it must become\r\nmore realistic. And, as we have already noted, by making use of the\r\nblock as a sort of background, even some relation of man to his\r\nenvironment can be represented. Through the group the simpler relations\r\nof man with his fellows--comradeship, love, conflict, or common\r\naction--can be expressed; although the power of sculpture is greatly\r\nlimited in this direction. Sculpture is often taxed by people who\r\nemphasize the importance of the political and industrial mechanism\r\nwith inability to portray large groups of men and the more complex\r\nrelations arising out of the dependence of man upon nature and society.\r\nBut one may well urge the compensating worth which sculpture will\r\nalways possess of recalling men to a sense of the value and beauty of\r\nthe individual as such, especially in an age like our own where they\r\ntend to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe principles that apply to the use of historical, literary, and\r\nsymbolic themes in painting hold with increased force in sculpture.\r\nWe must admit the right of the sculptor to illustrate simple and\r\nwell-known historical or fictitious situations. At the same time,\r\nhowever, we must remember that a work of this kind is subject to a\r\ntwofold standard: first and indispensable, the sculptural, is the form\r\nanimate and beautiful; then, are the life and action appropriate to\r\nthe idea? The first is alone absolutely unequivocal. The second, on\r\nthe other hand, is largely relative; for unless the sculptor has carried\r\nout the idea in so masterly a fashion that we can think of no other\r\npossibility--as Phidias is said to have done with his statue of\r\nZeus--there must always be something arbitrary about any particular\r\nrepresentation. This arbitrary element is increased in symbolic\r\nsculpture. You can perhaps depict an actual or fictitious human\r\nsituation by means of sculptured bodies and make your image seem\r\ninevitable; but how can you make bodies the vehicles of abstractions?\r\nMoreover, sculpture is a realistic art; it presents us with the\r\nsemblance of living forms, and if these forms are monstrous or are\r\nshown accomplishing impossible things, they cannot escape a certain\r\naspect of the ridiculous. I have in mind Rodin's \"Man and His Thought.\"\r\nIf the man were only represented fashioning the figure with his hands,\r\nhis hands guided by his thought; but the hands are inactive, and the\r\nfigure grows by thought alone! Or consider \"The Hand of God\" by the\r\nsame artist. To say that we are in the hands of God is a good\r\nmetaphorical way of expressing our dependence upon the Destiny that\r\nshapes our ends; but it is another thing to exhibit us as actually\r\nenfolded by a hand.\r\n\r\nThe more sensitive we are to the beauty of the body and of the mind,\r\nso far as manifest through the body, the better content we shall be\r\nwith normal sculpture and the less urgently we shall demand symbolism.\r\nOf course all statues may become symbolic, as all works of art may,\r\nin the sense of possessing a universal meaning won by generalizing\r\ntheir individual significance. Symbolic in this legitimate way were\r\nthe statues of the Greek gods; thus Aphrodite, who was lovely, became\r\nLove, and Athena, who was wise, became Wisdom. But there is nothing\r\narbitrary in such symbolism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nBEAUTY IN THE INDUSTRIAL ARTS: ARCHITECTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the arts which we have studied so far, beauty has been the sole or\r\nchief end; in the industrial arts, beauty can be only a part of their\r\ntotal meaning. No matter how much of an artist a builder or a potter\r\nmay be, he is necessarily controlled by the practical needs which\r\nhouses and pots subserve. This was the original condition of all\r\nartists; for \"in the beginning,\" before life's various aims were\r\ndistinguished and pursued in isolation, the beautiful was always married\r\nto some other interest. Our method of study has, therefore, reversed\r\nthe temporal order; but with intent, for we believe that the nature\r\nof a thing is better revealed in its final than in its rudimentary\r\nform. To complete our survey of the arts, we must, however, give some\r\nconsideration to those works in which the unity of the useful and the\r\nbeautiful is still preserved; and as an example we have chosen\r\narchitecture, the most magnificent of them all.\r\n\r\nFirst, we must clear up what might seem to be an inconsistency in our\r\nthinking. In our definition of art we insisted upon the freedom of\r\nbeauty and the contrast between the aesthetic and the practical\r\nattitudes, yet now we are admitting that some things may be at once\r\nuseful and beautiful. It would seem as if we must either modify our\r\ndefinition of art or else deny beauty to such objects as bridges and\r\nbuildings. But we cannot do the latter, for the beauty of Brooklyn\r\nbridge or Notre Dame in Paris is a matter of direct feeling, which no\r\ntheory can disestablish. And it is impossible to solve the problem by\r\nsupposing that in the industrial arts beauty and utility are extraneous\r\nto each other, two separable aspects, which have no intimate connection.\r\nFor the fact that a bridge spans a river or that a church is a place\r\nof worship is an element in its beauty. The aesthetic meaning of the\r\nobject depends upon the practical meaning. You cannot reduce the beauty\r\nof a bridge or a cathedral to such factors as mere size and fine\r\nproportions, without relation to function. No preconceived idea of the\r\npurity of beauty can undermine our intuition of the beauty of utility.\r\n\r\nYet the dependence of beauty upon utility in the industrial arts is\r\nnot at variance with the freedom from practical attitudes which we\r\nhave claimed for it. For the beauty is still in the realm of perception,\r\nof contemplation, not of use. It is a pleasure in seeing how the purpose\r\nis expressed in the form and material of the object, not a pleasure\r\nin the possession of the object or an enjoyment of its benefits. I may\r\ntake pleasure in the vision of purpose well embodied in an object which\r\nanother man possesses, and my admiration will be as disinterested as\r\nmy appreciation of a statue. And even if I do make use of the object,\r\nI may still get an aesthetic experience out of it, whenever I pause and\r\nsurvey it, delighting in it as an adequate expression of its purpose\r\nand my own joy in using it. Then beauty supervenes upon mere utility,\r\nand a value for contemplation grows out of and, for the moment,\r\nsupplants a value in use. I now take delight in the perception of an\r\nobject when formerly I took delight only in its use; I now enjoy the\r\nexpression of purpose for its present perceived perfection, when once\r\nI enjoyed it only for its ulterior results. Such intervals of restful\r\ncontemplation interrupt the activity of every thoughtful maker or user\r\nof tools. Thus the practical life may enter into the aesthetic, and\r\nthat which grows out of exigence may develop into freedom.\r\n\r\nThere is one more objection which may be urged against the aesthetic\r\ncharacter of the expression of practical purpose, namely, that the\r\nappreciation of it is an affair of intellect, not of feeling. This\r\nwould indeed be fatal if it were necessarily true; but all men who\r\nlove their work know that they put into admiration for their tools as\r\nmuch of warm emotion as of mind. There remains, however, the genuine\r\ndifficulty of communicating this emotional perception of useful objects,\r\nof making it universal. It must be admitted that the attitude of the\r\naverage beholder towards a useful object is usually practical, not\r\ncontemplative, or else purely intellectual, an effort to understand\r\nits structure, with the idea of eventual use. Most works of industrial\r\nart produce no aesthetic experience whatever. But to be a genuine and\r\ncomplete work of fine art, an object must be so made that it will\r\nimmediately impel the spectator to regard it aesthetically.\r\n\r\nFrom what we have already established, we know how this requirement\r\ncan be met: by elaborating the outer aspects of the object in the\r\ndirection of pleasure and expression. By this means the beauty of mere\r\nappearance will strike and occupy the mind, inducing the aesthetic\r\nattitude towards the outside, from which it may then spread and embrace\r\nthe inner, purposive meaning. The obviously disinterested and warmly\r\nemotional admiration of the shape will prevent the admiration for the\r\npurposive adaptation from being cold and abstract. Hence, although\r\nfrom the point of view of utility the beauty of mere appearance may\r\nseem to be a superfluity, it is almost indispensable from an aesthetic\r\npoint of view, since it raises the appreciation of the purpose to the\r\naesthetic plane. And we can understand how enthusiastic workmen, whose\r\nadmiration for their work is already aesthetic, must necessarily desire\r\nto consecrate and communicate this feeling by beautifying the appearance\r\nof their products; how inevitably, through the ages, they have made\r\nthings not only as perfect as they could, but as charming.\r\n\r\nWhen developed for the ends of the aesthetic life, the useful object\r\nexhibits, therefore, two levels of beauty: first, that of appearance,\r\nof form and sensation, line and shape and color; and second, that of\r\npurpose spoken in the form. The first is of the vague and immediate\r\ncharacter so well known to us; the second is more definite and less\r\ndirect, since it depends upon the interpretation of the object in terms\r\nof its function. The relation between the two is like that which\r\nobtains, in a painting, between color and line, on the one hand, and\r\nrepresentation, on the other. When the first level of beauty is richly\r\ndeveloped on its own account, it becomes ornament. In a Greek vase,\r\nfor example, there is a beauty of symmetrical, well-proportioned shape,\r\ndelicate coloring of surface, and decorative painting, which might be\r\nfelt by people who knew nothing of its use; and, in addition, for those\r\nwho have this knowledge, a beauty in the fine balance of parts in the\r\nadjustment of clay to its final cause. These factors, which we have\r\ndistinguished by analysis, should, however, be felt as one in the\r\naesthetic intuition of the object; the form, although beautiful in\r\nitself, should reveal the function, and the decoration, no matter how\r\ncharming, should be appropriate and subordinate. Otherwise, as indeed\r\nso often happens, the beauty of one aspect may completely dominate the\r\nothers; when the object either remains a pretty ornament perhaps, but\r\nis functionally dead; or else, if it keep this life, loses its unity\r\nin a rivalry of beautiful aspects.\r\n\r\nAll these points are strikingly illustrated in architecture. The\r\narchitects claim that their art is a liberal one aiming at beauty, yet\r\nmost buildings to-day are objects of practical interest alone. Their\r\ndoors are merely for entrance, their windows for admission of light,\r\ntheir walls for inclosure. Few people, as they hurry in or out of an\r\noffice building or a railway station, stay to contemplate the majesty\r\nof the height or the elegance of the facade; they transact their\r\nbusiness, buy their tickets, check their luggage, and go. Even when\r\nthe building has some claim to beauty, the mood of commercial life\r\nstifles observation; or, if the building is observed, there is no\r\nstrong emotion or vivid play of imagination, no permanent impression\r\nof beauty lingering in the memory, no enrichment of the inner life,\r\nsuch as a musical air or a poem affords, but only a transient and\r\nfruitless recognition. For this reason many have thought that buildings\r\nmust become useless, as castles and ruined temples are, in order to\r\nbe beautiful. Yet, in proportion as this is true, it involves a failure\r\non the part of architecture, a failure to make the useful a part of\r\nthe beautiful. A building, which was designed to be a habitation of\r\nman, when taken apart from the life which it was meant to shelter and\r\nsustain, is an abstraction or a vain ornament at best. If the company\r\nwhich peopled it are gone, it can win significance only if we re-create\r\nthem in the imagination, moving in the halls or worshiping at the\r\naltars. We cannot get rid of the practical for the sake of the aesthetic,\r\nbut must take up the practical into the aesthetic. For this reason\r\narchitecture has achieved its greatest successes where its uses have\r\nbeen most largely and freely emotional, most closely akin to the\r\nbrooding spirit of beauty--in religious buildings.\r\n\r\nMost buildings, it must be admitted, are not beautiful at all. In order\r\nto be beautiful, they should be alive, and alive all over, as a piece\r\nof sculpture is alive; there should be no unresponsive surfaces or\r\ndetails; but most of our buildings are dead--dead walls, dead lines,\r\noblong boxes, neat and commodious, but dead. The practical problems\r\nwhich the architect has to solve are so complex and difficult, and the\r\nmaterials which he uses are so refractory, that there is inevitably\r\na sacrifice of the beauty of appearance to utility. The very size of\r\na building makes it aesthetically unmanageable all over. Here the lesser\r\nindustrial arts, like the goldsmith's, have an advantage in the superior\r\ncontrol which the workman can exert over his materials; his work is\r\nthat of a single mind and hand; it does not require, as architecture\r\ndoes, the cooperation of a crowd of unfeeling artisans. In architecture,\r\nmechanical necessities and forms threaten to supplant aesthetic\r\nprinciples and shapes. The heavy square blocks, the rectangular lines,\r\nseem the antithesis of life and beauty. \"All warmth, all movement, all\r\nlove is round, or at least oval.... Only the cold, immovable,\r\nindifferent, and hateful is straight and square.... Life is round, and\r\ndeath is angular.\" [Footnote: Ellen Key, _The Few and the Many_,\r\ntranslated from a quotation in Max Dessoir, _Aesthetik und Allgemeine\r\nKunstwissenschaft_, page 396.] What vividness of imagination or\r\nsentiment can transmute these dead and hollow masses into a life\r\nuniversally felt?\r\n\r\nAnd yet, in a series of works of art among the most magnificent that\r\nman possesses, this miracle was achieved. The Greek temples and Gothic\r\ncathedrals are so much alive that they seem not to have been made with\r\nhands, but to have grown. The straight lines have been modified into\r\ndelicate curves, the angles have given place to arches, the stiff and\r\nmathematical have been molten into movement and surprise, the heaviness\r\nhas been so nicely balanced or overcome that it has been changed into\r\nlightness, with the help of human and animal sculpture and floral\r\ncarving the inorganic has been transformed into the organic, by means\r\nof painting and stained glass even the dull surfaces of walls and\r\nwindows have been made to glow into life. Artists wrought each portion\r\nand detail, and built the whole for the glory of God and the city, a\r\nmonument for quiet contemplation, not a mere article to be used. With\r\nfew exceptions, any architectural beauty that we create is but a feeble\r\necho of theirs. Some day we may be able to produce something worthy\r\nto be placed by its side, but only when we have sanctified our life\r\nwith communal aims. The aesthetic effect of a building depends upon\r\nmany factors, of which only a few can be analyzed by us in this short\r\nchapter. If we abstract from its relation to purpose, architecture is\r\nfundamentally an art of spatial form. Working freely with it, under\r\nthe sole limitation of function, the architect can make of this form\r\na complex, various, and beautiful language intelligible to all men,\r\nand possessed of a systematic, yet fluent logic. Of this language the\r\nsimplest element is line. At first view, as we approach a building\r\nfrom the outside, its beauty, as in the case of sculpture, is\r\nessentially pictorial. For, although a building is a three-dimensional\r\nsolid in reality, each view of it is a two-dimensional surface, bounded\r\nby lines and divided and diversified within by other lines. Now these\r\nlines have their life and beauty like the lines of a picture. How they\r\nget this life and what its specific quality is in the case of particular\r\nlines, we need not explain again; but no one can fail to feel the\r\nupward movement of the vertical lines of the Gothic style, the repose\r\nof the horizontal lines of the Renaissance style, the playful grace\r\nof the Rococo. Naturally, since the front of a building, where one\r\nenters, is the most important and the most constantly in view, its\r\npictorial beauty is elaborated with especial care by the architect.\r\nThis is the justification of the overshadowing preeminence of the\r\nfacade in Renaissance palaces, which indeed was oftentimes the only\r\nvisible part of the outside of the building. When, however, the building\r\nis perspicuous all round, it should, like a statue, present a beautiful\r\nview from every standpoint.\r\n\r\nIn architecture, as in painting, the visual elements are adapted to\r\none or the other of the two chief ways of seeing. Either the surfaces\r\nare seen as wholes primarily and the details in subordination; or else\r\nthe parts stand out clear and distinct, and the whole is their\r\nsummation. The former is always the case when the surfaces are left\r\nplain with few divisions, or, if the surfaces are divided, when the\r\nlines intersect and intermingle, as is exemplified in late Renaissance\r\nor Baroque work, where the walls are covered with lavish ornament, the\r\nenframement of windows is broken by moldings and sculpture which carry\r\ninto the surrounding spaces, and where, instead of embracing one story,\r\nthe \"orders\" comprise the entire height of the building. The second\r\npossibility is well illustrated by the early classical Renaissance,\r\nwhere the surface of each story, sharply separated from the others by\r\nthe line of the frieze, is divided regularly by arches or columns,\r\neach window clearly enframed, and every sculptured ornament provided\r\nwith a niche.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, this fundamental difference between architectural\r\nand pictorial lines: the latter are usually pure kinematical lines,\r\nlines of free and un-resisted movement, while the former are usually\r\ndynamical, lines of force which move against the resistance of mass.\r\nIn a picture objects are volatilized into light and have lost all\r\nweight; but in architecture, since they are present in reality and not\r\nin mere semblance, their weight is retained. A Greek column, for\r\nexample, not only moves upward, but also against the superincumbent\r\nload of the entablature which it carries. The difference between the\r\ntwo arts can be appreciated by comparing the picture of a building\r\nwith the building itself; in the former, despite the fact that we know\r\nhow heavy the dome or pediment is, and how strong therefore the piers\r\nor columns that support it, we hardly feel them as heavy or strong at\r\nall--the forces and masses have been transformed into abstract lines\r\nand shapes. Sometimes, however, architectural lines and surfaces remain\r\npurely kinematical; on the inside of our rooms, for example, when the\r\nsurfaces are smooth, and especially when they are decorated, we often\r\nfeel no tension of conflicting forces, but only a quiet play of\r\nmovements; it is as if the walls had been changed into the paper or\r\npaint that covers them. The vividness of the expression of mechanical\r\nforces in architecture depends, moreover, upon the kind of materials\r\nemployed; it is greater in marble than in wood, and less in our modern\r\nconstructions of steel and glass, where the piers move in single\r\nvertical lines from the bottom to the top of the building, than in the\r\nold forms, where the upper part of the building is frankly carried by\r\nthe lower.\r\n\r\nThe mere expression of mechanical forces in a building would not,\r\nhowever, be aesthetic by itself, no matter how obvious to the mind.\r\nWe must not only know these forces to be there, we must also feel them\r\nas there; we must appreciate them in terms of our own experiences in\r\nsupporting weights and overcoming resistances. We must transform the\r\nmechanical into the vital, the material into the human. Art is an\r\nexpression of life, not of mathematics. And this translation is not\r\nthe result of an unusual, artificial attitude assumed for the sake of\r\naesthetic appreciation; it is the natural mode of apperceiving force\r\nand mass. We cannot see a column supporting an entablature without\r\nfeeling that it stands firm to bear the weight, much as we should stand\r\nif we were in its place. If this is a \"pathetic fallacy,\" it is one\r\nwhich we all inevitably commit. Even the skeptic, if he were to examine\r\ncarefully into his own mind, would find that he commits it, whenever\r\nhe gives to the column, not a casual or merely calculating regard, but\r\na free and earnest attention. If he gives his mind to the column and\r\nlets the column take hold of his mind, allowing his psychological\r\nmechanism to work unhampered, he will commit it. The aesthetic intuition\r\nof force--the human way of appreciating it--is, in fact, primary; the\r\npurely mechanical and mathematical is an abstraction, superimposed for\r\npractical and scientific purposes.\r\n\r\nThe interplay of humanized mechanical energies, of which architecture\r\nis the expression, may be conceived as the resultant of four chief\r\nforces, acting each in a definite direction: upward, downward, outward,\r\nand inward. The downward force is associated with the weight of the\r\nmaterials of which the building is constructed. To all physical objects\r\nwe ascribe a tendency toward the earth. An unsupported weight will\r\nfall, and even when supported will exert a pressure downward. And this\r\ntendency is no mere directed force in the physical sense, but an\r\nimpulse, in the personal sense. For when with hand or shoulder we\r\nsupport a weight, we inevitably interpret it in terms of our own\r\nvoluntary muscular exertion in resisting it; even as we strive to\r\nresist it, so it seems to strive to fall. Although this force is exerted\r\ndownward, it shows itself in the horizontal lines of a building, in\r\nstring courses, parapets, cornices, friezes; for the horizontal is the\r\nline parallel to the earth, toward which the force is directed, and\r\nalong which we lie when we rest.[Footnote: Compare the discussion of\r\nLipps, _Aesthetik_, Bd. 1, Dritter Abschnitt, although I am far\r\nfrom accepting all of his analyses.]\r\n\r\nOpposed to the downward force is the upward force. If an object does\r\nnot fall, it must be supported by a force in the upward direction; the\r\nhand must exert a force perpendicular to the mass which it carries;\r\nthe body must hold itself erect in order to bear its own weight. Just\r\nso, an architectural member, if it is not to collapse, must raise\r\nitself upward. Upward forces are revealed by the vertical lines of a\r\nbuilding--the prevailing lines of columns, piers, shafts, pinnacles,\r\ntowers, spires. We interpret vertical lines as moving upward, partly\r\nbecause the eye moves upward in scanning them, partly because we\r\nourselves move in lines of this general direction in going from the\r\nbottom to the top of a building. Even when we are at the top of a\r\nbuilding we apprehend its vertical lines as rising rather than as\r\ndescending, because we ourselves had to rise in order to get there.\r\nConverging lines, as of towers and spires, we also interpret in the\r\nsame way as going to the point of meeting above.\r\n\r\nActing in conjunction with the downward force is an outward one. The\r\nlower parts of a construction tend to spread out as they give way under\r\nthe weight of the superincumbent masses; if they are very much broader\r\nthan the latter, they give the impression of great weight carried. As\r\na result, a horizontal line is introduced, and the longer it is in\r\ncomparison with the vertical line of height, the heavier the effect.\r\nCompare, for example, the impression made by a tall and thin triangular\r\nshape, with a low and broad one; and compare also the relative lengths\r\nof the horizontal and the vertical lines. The former shape seems simply\r\nto rise, while the latter lifts. We seem to observe the working of\r\nthis outward force, as Lipps has remarked, in the spreading out of the\r\ntrunks of trees at the base and in the feet of animals; and we feel\r\nit in ourselves whenever we spread our limbs apart to brace ourselves\r\nto withstand a load.\r\n\r\nWhenever the outward force is resisted, it gives evidence of the\r\nexistence of a force operating in the opposed direction--inward. Without\r\nthis force, the lower parts of a construction would lack all solidity\r\nand spread like a molten mass on the ground. This is especially striking\r\nwhere the material, instead of spreading outward and downward, seems\r\nto press itself inward and upward. Compare, for example, a shape whose\r\nbase-line is smaller than the line of its top with one in which the\r\nreverse holds true. The former gives the impression of lightness and\r\nagility, with a prevailing upward trend, the other an impression of\r\nweight and heaviness, with a prevailing trend towards the ground.\r\nObviously, the outward and the inward forces are correlative and\r\ncomplementary: we have already observed that a construction would\r\ncollapse without the inward; we can now see that it would disappear\r\nentirely without the outward. Obviously, also, the inward and upward\r\ngo together, and the downward and outward.\r\n\r\nEven a plain rectangular wall manifests the interplay of these forces.\r\nThe horizontal dimension represents the downward and outward force of\r\nthe weight; the vertical dimension, the upward forces, which prevent\r\nthe wall from collapsing in itself and hold it upright; while the\r\nlateral boundaries give evidence of the inward tension that keeps the\r\nmass together. But the most beautiful expressions of architectural\r\nforces are to be found in the historical styles. In each style there\r\nis a characteristic relationship between the forces, imparting a\r\ndistinctive feeling. I shall offer a brief analysis of some of these.\r\n\r\nMany have recognized that the classical Greek construction, as\r\nillustrated in the Doric temple, expresses a fine equilibrium between\r\nthe upward and the downward forces, embodied in the vertical and\r\nhorizontal lines respectively. The upward force is manifest primarily\r\nin the vertical columns, and is emphasized there by the flutings, the\r\nslight progressive narrowing toward the top, and the inward effort of\r\nthe necking just below the echinus. The downward force is embodied in\r\nthe horizontal lines of the lintel, architrave, cornice, and in the\r\nhanging mutules and gutta. The two forces come to rest in the abaci,\r\nwhich, as the crowning members of the columns, directly carry the\r\nweight of the entire entablature. The equilibrium between the horizontal\r\nand the vertical tendencies is, however, not a static but a moving\r\none; for the two opposing forces are present in every part of the\r\nbuilding from the stylobate to the ridge of the triangular pediment.\r\nThe downward force is already manifest in the widened base of the\r\ncolumn, where it works in conjunction with the inward tendency, and\r\nshows its effect at the critical points at the top of the supporting\r\ncolumn--in the spreading echinus with its horizontal bands beneath and\r\nin the horizontal lines of the abaci. The upward force, on the other\r\nhand, is continued right through the solid mass of the entablature,\r\nin the vertical lines of the triglyphs, in the antefixes, and even to\r\nthe very apex of the building, where the ascending lines of the\r\ntriangular pediment meet. The resulting total effect is that of a\r\nperfect, yet swaying balance.\r\n\r\nThe aesthetic effect derived from the interplay of forces in the Ionic\r\nform is similar to that in the Doric, only more delicate and elastic.\r\nThe slender columns, being less rugged and resistant than the Doric,\r\nseem to transmit the weight supported, which shows itself, therefore,\r\nin the outward spreading molded base; but this apparent lack of strength\r\nin the column is compensated for by the elastic energy in the coiled\r\nspring of the volutes, upon which, with the slight mediation of a\r\nnarrow band, the entablature rests. Here most of the upward energy of\r\nthe Ionic form is concentrated; for although the dentils of the frieze\r\nperform the function of the triglyphs, they are too small to do it\r\neffectively; the style lacks, therefore, the gentle harmonizing of\r\nforces all over, characteristic of the Doric, and evinces instead a\r\nclean-cut elastic tension at a given point. This effect is, however,\r\nsomewhat softened by the breaking up of the downward force of weight\r\nby means of the recessed divisions of the architrave. In the Corinthian\r\ncapital, which has the same general feeling as the Ionic, the elastic\r\ntension is still further diminished through the renewed emphasis on\r\nthe mediating abacus, the reduction of the size of the volutes, and\r\nthe overhanging floral carvings. However, by reason of the strength\r\ngiven by the bell and the projecting outward and upward curving form\r\nof the abacus, the suggestion of weakness in the Corinthian form is\r\novercome, but the gentleness remains.\r\n\r\nIf the Greek construction expresses a balance between the upward and\r\ndownward forces, the arched forms that followed express the victory\r\nof the upward. In the arch the upward force, instead of being arrested\r\nwhere the support meets the mass to be carried, is continued throughout\r\nthe mass itself. Of the two chief types of arches, the round and the\r\npointed, each has a specific feeling. We shall study the round form\r\nfirst, where the vertical tendency is indeed victorious, but only\r\nthrough reconciliation and compromise.\r\n\r\nIn the round arch all four forces are beautifully expressed. The upward\r\nis manifest, first, in the vertical pier, which acts very much as the\r\ncolumn does, and, in Roman work, was often replaced by the column. The\r\nopposing downward force is expressed in the horizontal upper bound of\r\nthe arch and in the line of the impost, also horizontal, which breaks\r\nthe vertical line and so marks the place where the two forces come\r\ninto sharpest conflict. In this conflict, the vertical is victorious;\r\nfor, instead of being stopped by the impost, it is carried up throughout\r\nthe entire construction by means of the upward and inward curving of\r\nthe arch. The very curve of the arch shows, however, that the victory\r\nis not absolute; for its circular form is obviously determined as a\r\ncompromise between an inward centripetal force, moving upward and\r\ndiminishing the breadth of the arch to a mere point at its apex, and\r\nan outward centrifugal force, gradually spreading the arch downward\r\nuntil it reaches its greatest breadth at the impost, where it is\r\narrested by the opposing vertical force in the pier. To the historical\r\nimagination, the round arch seems, therefore, to express the genial\r\nclassical idea of a control by the higher nature which nevertheless\r\ndid no violence to the demands of the lower. In the spherical dome the\r\neffect is the same, only the interplay of forces operates in three\r\ndimensions instead of two.\r\n\r\nWhen arches are superposed, the upward movement proceeds in stages,\r\nbeginning anew at each horizontal division of the wall space. The use\r\nof entablatures applied to the wall and of engaged columns, common in\r\nRoman work, seems to involve an attempt at a fusion of two contradictory\r\nstyles, and is usually condemned as such. This contradiction can be\r\nsolved, however, by viewing the entablatures as mere weightless lines\r\nof division of the wall, usually marking off the different stories,\r\nand by viewing the columns in a similar fashion as having no supporting\r\nfunction--which is actually the case--and as simply serving the purpose\r\nof framing the arches. At most they merely indicate the direction of\r\nthe chief contending forces,--the parallel lintels signalizing the\r\nforce of weight, and the vertical columns, standing one upon the other,\r\npointing the movement of the upward force. They have, therefore, a\r\npictorial rather than a dynamic significance.\r\n\r\nDifferences of feeling in arched forms depend upon the relative height\r\nof arches and supporting piers and columns. The vertical effect is\r\nstrongly emphasized when the latter are relatively high, while the\r\neffect of weight is increased in flattened arches, which for this\r\nreason are especially appropriate for crypts and prison entrances.\r\nInteresting complications are introduced in arcades or intersecting\r\nvaults, where a single column serves as a support for two or more\r\narches; for there the vertical force is divided, flowing in different\r\ndirections in the little triangular piece of wall between, or along\r\nthe ribs of the vaults. Something similar occurs in the Byzantine dome\r\non pendentives, only instead of supporting the horizontal weight of\r\na gallery or a vault, the triangular pendentives meet the outward\r\nthrust of a superposed dome.\r\n\r\nIn Renaissance architecture and the modern classical revivals, where\r\nGreek and Roman styles are freely adapted to novel modes of life and\r\npurpose, no essentially new form was added to architectural speech.\r\nThere were combinations of old forms into more complex structures, but\r\nno new important elements. The most outstanding novelty is perhaps the\r\nreversed relation between the whole and the parts. [Footnote: See P.\r\nFrankl, _Die Entwicklungsphasen der neueren Baukunst_, 1914.] In\r\nthe classic styles, whether arched or Greek, the whole is built up of\r\nthe parts additively; each is a relatively independent center of energy\r\ncomplete in itself; first the columns, then the architrave, frieze,\r\nand cornice, then the pediment; or first one row of arches, then another\r\nrow on top of this, and so on. Coordination is the governing principle.\r\nBut in the modern adaptations, even where coordination rather than\r\nsubordination rules in the pictorial sphere, the whole is first\r\ndynamically and the parts are secondary. In the typical Renaissance\r\nfacade, for example, the arches of the windows are rather openings in\r\nthe walls than supporting members. They are centers of little eddies\r\nof force, rather than independent parts of the main determining stream\r\nof energy. The wall rises as a whole to its heavy overhanging cornice,\r\ndespite the horizontal divisions marking the stories. There are,\r\nhowever, important differences between the various modern types; the\r\nearlier Renaissance forms, for example, keeping closer to the antique\r\nthan the later Baroque and Rococo.\r\n\r\nThe complete triumph of the vertical tendency, foreshadowed in the\r\nRoman, was proclaimed in Gothic architecture in the use of the pointed\r\narch. For in the round arch the vertical has not conquered after all;\r\nthe horizontal is still active there, even to the apex of the arch,\r\nwhere the tangential line is parallel to the earth, the line of weight.\r\nBut in the pointed style the victory of the vertical is clearly\r\ndecisive,--the upward and inward forces, by elongating and narrowing\r\nthe curve of the arch to a point, have dominated the downward and\r\noutward. The great height of the piers, the gabled roofs, the ribs of\r\nthe vaults the pointed form of the windows, the towers, spires, and\r\npinnacles,--all proclaim it. Yet this victory does not occur without\r\nopposition; for the higher the vaulting, the greater the weight to be\r\ncarried; the greater, therefore, the outward thrust, which had to find\r\nits expression and its stay in the buttress. But even the buttress,\r\nalthough it bears witness to the outward and horizontal force of weight,\r\nwas nevertheless so fashioned with its gable and pinnacle, or its own\r\narched form, as to aid the upward movement. The thinness of walls and\r\npartitions, and the piercing of these with arches and windows, by\r\nlightening the force of weight, also contributed to increase the\r\nvertical movement. At sight of a true Gothic cathedral, we feel\r\nourselves fairly lifted off the ground and rushed upward.\r\n\r\nIn thinking of the beauty of architecture, we are all too apt to\r\nconsider the exterior exclusively, forgetting that the inside of a\r\nbuilding, where we live, is even more important practically, and is\r\ncapable of at least as great an aesthetic effect.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic aesthetic effect of the interior is a function of\r\nthe inclosed space, the volume, not of the inclosing walls taken singly.\r\nThe walls are only the limits of this space, they are not the space\r\nitself. Of course, the walls within have their own beauty, of surface\r\nand pervading energy, but this does not differ markedly from that of\r\nthe walls seen from the outside, and what we have established for the\r\none holds for the other. But the beauty of the inclosed space is\r\nsomething entirely new.\r\n\r\nIn itself, however, mere volume of space is no more aesthetic than\r\nmere bounding line or surface; in order to become beautiful, it must\r\nbecome alive. But how can space--the most abstract thing in the\r\nworld--become alive? By having the activities which it incloses felt\r\ninto it. Just as our bodies are felt to be alive because our activities\r\nexpress themselves there, so our rooms, because we live and move within\r\nthem. As we enter a cathedral and look down the long aisle, the movement\r\nof our eyes inevitably suggests the movement of our bodies; or, as we\r\nlook up and our eyes follow the ribs of the vaulting, it is as if we\r\nourselves were borne aloft; in the imagination we move through the\r\nopen spaces; and since we do not actually move, we locate our impulses\r\nto movement, not in our bodies, but in the space through which we take\r\nour imagined flight. Every object suggests movement to it, and we fill\r\nthe intervening space with this imagined movement, provided only we\r\nstay our activities and give time for the imagination to work its will.\r\nThus all space may become alive with the possibilities of movement\r\nwhich it offers.\r\n\r\nThe aesthetic effects of volume vary chiefly according to size and\r\nshape. In order to be appreciated, these effects must in general be\r\nsomewhat striking; otherwise they pass unnoticed, and we simply take\r\nthe interiors of our buildings as matters of course.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that an impression of vastness can be secured by\r\ninclosing a relatively small space. A square, like the Place de la\r\nConcorde, or even the inside of a cathedral, produces a feeling of\r\nsize almost, if not quite, as great as an open prairie or sea. The\r\nreason, I suppose, is that an inclosed space offers definite points\r\nas stimuli and goals for suggested movements. As we imaginatively reach\r\nout and touch these points, we seem to encompass their distance; and\r\nthe volume of our own bodies seems to be magnified accordingly. The\r\nboundaries of the space become a second and greater integument. This\r\nis of decisive importance; for the aesthetic appreciation of size is\r\nrelative to an appreciation of the size of our own bodies; in nature\r\nitself there is nothing either large or small. Along with the sense\r\nof vastness goes a sense of freedom; the one is the aesthetic experience\r\nresulting from the imaginative reaching of the goal of a movement, the\r\nother is the feeling of the imagined movement itself.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the other hand, an inclosure is small, as in the case of a\r\ncell, and especially when the ceiling or vault is low, as in a crypt,\r\nit feels cabined and confined, because our own possibilities of movement\r\nare restricted. In order to avoid this feeling, if a space is limited\r\nin one direction, it must be free in another; if narrow, it must be\r\nlong; if small in plan, it must be high, as in a tower.\r\n\r\nThe form of an inclosed space is also expressive. There are two chief\r\ntypes, the longitudinal and the radial; but since these may exist\r\neither in plan or in elevation, four possibilities result: the\r\nlongitudinal-horizontal, as in an aisle; the longitudinal-vertical,\r\nas in a tower; the radial-horizontal, illustrated by every equilateral\r\nplan--triangle, square, regular polygon, and above all, the most perfect\r\nform of this type, the circle; and finally, the radial-vertical, of\r\nwhich domed spaces, like the Pantheon or St. Paul's, are examples. The\r\nterms used to designate them, together with the examples, afford a\r\ngood idea of what these space forms are, making further description\r\nunnecessary. It is interesting to observe how different the expression\r\nof the square and the triangle is when they determine the plan of an\r\ninclosed space from what it is when they are the shapes of walls.\r\n[Footnote: Compare Fritz Hoeber: _Systematik der\r\nArchitekturproportionen_, II, B, a. ] In the case of the latter,\r\naccording to the analysis which we have given of them, the figures\r\nrepresent an interplay of antagonistic horizontal and vertical forces,\r\nabout an axis drawn perpendicular to the midpoint of the base line;\r\nwhile as plans they express forces homogeneous in kind radiating from\r\ntheir centers. The feeling of longitudinal forms is one of continued\r\nmovement, forward or upward as the case may be; when the distance is\r\nvery great, the feeling is of infinity, either of vista, as in an\r\naisle, or of height, as in a tower, for even when the point at the end\r\nis clearly seen and known, we continue it in the imagination. The\r\nradial forms, on the other hand, even when the axes are very long,\r\nexpress completeness and security, for no matter how far we go in any\r\none direction, we have to proceed along a line which brings us back\r\nto our starting point; in following to the top the movement of the\r\ncurved line of a dome or an apse, the continuation of the same line\r\ncarries us down on the other side to a point corresponding to the one\r\nfrom which we set out; if we wander, we return home.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the division of interiors into parts, the same two\r\ntypes are exemplified which we found in studying the visual and the\r\ndynamic aspects of buildings. Either the parts of the interior space\r\nare clearly marked off from each other, and the perception of the whole\r\nwhich they constitute is reached by a process of summation; or else,\r\nto one standing within, the space is first perceived as a whole, and\r\nits parts, lacking clear definition, are perceived subsequently. In\r\nthe former type, the parts are of pronounced individuality, and the\r\nwhole is their free and joint work; in the latter, the parts are merged,\r\nand tend to be lost in the whole. These two possibilities exist whether\r\nthe space be of radial or longitudinal form. In general, the classical\r\nstyles lend themselves to the coordinate type of division of the\r\ninterior, while the later styles favor the subordination of the parts\r\nto the whole.\r\n\r\nThe other factors in the beauty of architecture, besides the expression\r\nof the forces resident in its forms, can receive only scant notice\r\nfrom us. Among these is light--its admission, exclusion, and diffusion.\r\nA house with ample windows flooded with sunshine shares the feeling\r\nof an open day; a cathedral, dimly lighted, stimulates a mood of\r\nbrooding mystery and meditation, like some dark forest. Another factor\r\nis color. Color plays a double part in architecture: first, to enliven\r\nthe neutral tones of certain materials; and second, to impart specific\r\nmoods. It was no barbaric taste, but a keen feeling for life and warmth\r\nthat induced the Greeks to paint their temples; and without their rose\r\nwindows, Gothic cathedrals are like faces from which the glow of life\r\nis departing. The different colors have the same feelings in\r\narchitecture that they have in painting. The reds and purples of\r\necclesiastical stained glass stimulate the passion of adoration, the\r\nblues deepen it, and the yellows seem to offer a glimpse of heavenly\r\nbliss. Sound, its presence or its absence, is another factor in\r\narchitectural expression: the quiet of the church in contrast with the\r\nnoise of the busy street outside, the peal of the organ, or the chorus\r\nof young voices. Although architecture is a spatial art and music a\r\ntemporal art, they nevertheless go well together because the emotions\r\naroused by both are vague and voluminous, and the sounds, reverberating\r\nfrom the walls and filling the inclosed spaces, seem to fuse with them.\r\nOrnamental carving performs a diversifying and enlivening function\r\nsimilar to that of color. So long as its lines follow those of the\r\narchitectural forms, it may well be rich and elaborate. It is fitting,\r\nmoreover, that buildings designed to be houses of the gods should\r\ncontain their images, and that the same spirit that expresses itself\r\nin playful lines should become embodied in griffin and gargoyle.\r\nFinally, erected in the open, with no shelter or enframement, a building\r\nis, in large measure, a part of nature and possesses something of the\r\nbeauty of nature. Rooted to one place like a tree, it shares the beauty\r\nof its site, and responds to the ever varying effects of light and\r\nshadow, rain and mist and snow.\r\n\r\nThe abstract beauty of architecture can be understood without any\r\nknowledge of the purposes of buildings. A Hindu who knows nothing of\r\nour civilization cannot fail to be responsive to Notre Dame, any more\r\nthan we can fail to admire the beauty of Taj Mahal. The very simplest\r\narchitectural forms, like the pyramids or the Washington monument,\r\nprovided they are of sufficient size and mass, speak an eloquent\r\nlanguage which is immediately understood. And the content of their\r\nspeech is not so abstract as might be judged from our previous studies\r\nof it; for in architecture, as in music, concrete emotions and\r\nsentiments flow into the channel cut by the form. Longing, aspiration,\r\nand mystery have universally been felt into a form pointing skyward;\r\nand the feeling of incompleteness has been lost, and security regained,\r\nin an overarching dome.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, this difference between architecture and music. In\r\nmusic, the emotional content is purely personal; while in architecture,\r\nit may become social and historical. Architectural purposes are all\r\nsocial: the purposes of a family, a nation, a cult. And the purposes\r\nof the greatest of buildings--of those which serve the nation and\r\nreligion--are also historical; about them gather the traditions of\r\na community. Centers of the life of a people, created by it and enduring\r\nwith it, they become its symbols; or outlasting it, memorials and\r\nwitnesses to it. The vague emotions aroused by the architectural forms\r\nare pointed and enriched by this spirit: the vastness, seclusion,\r\nmagnificence, mystery, and aspiration of the Gothic cathedral become\r\nassociated with the life of the medieval Catholic church; the fine\r\nbalance, clarity, and simplicity of the Greek temple with the best in\r\nGreek culture. This interpretation of a building in terms of its purpose\r\nand history is necessary to a complete aesthetic appreciation. Without\r\nit, a building may have many beauties, all the beauties which we have\r\nanalyzed; but they are all separate, and there is no beauty of the\r\nwhole. It is the life which the many parts and aspects serve that makes\r\nthem into one.\r\n\r\nI shall close this chapter with a brief discussion of architectural\r\ncomposition. The unity of a building is constituted primarily by the\r\nnecessary adjustment of part to part which makes possible the life\r\nthat it incloses. How the parts serve this purpose is not immediately\r\nevident to intuition; nor can it be; yet it should be intelligible to\r\na thoughtful study. The knowledge thus gained may then enter into an\r\nimaginative vision, for which the building will seem like an organism\r\npulsing with life.\r\n\r\nThis purposive unity cannot well be secured without spatial contiguity;\r\nhere, as in sculpture, a unified life demands a unified material. Yet\r\nsometimes detached structures belong together functionally, and may\r\nbe felt as one aesthetically, provided they are similar in design and\r\nsome one of them is dominant; otherwise, each claims to be a distinct\r\nindividual, and aesthetic rivalry is the result.\r\n\r\nFunctional unity, although necessary, is not sufficient for aesthetic\r\nunity; in addition, there must be formal unity--design, composition.\r\nTo study this adequately would require a separate treatise, which has\r\nnot yet been written, so far as I know, with anything approaching\r\nphilosophical depth and completeness; but for our plan it will be\r\nsufficient to show how the general principles of aesthetic form are\r\nillustrated in architecture; and because of the perspicuity of things\r\nspatial, these principles are nowhere else so lucidly manifest.\r\n\r\nSince architecture is a spatial art, unity in variety is chiefly a\r\nmatter of harmony and balance rather than of evolution, and of these\r\nharmony is perhaps the most conspicuous. Harmony is secured in many\r\nways.\r\n\r\nFirst, by giving the whole building or parts of the building a simple\r\ngeometrical form readily perceived,--for example, the cruciform plan\r\nof many Gothic cathedrals, the oblong plan and oblong surmounted by\r\na triangle in the facade of the Greek temple, the octagonal shape of\r\na Renaissance chapel. A higher degree of harmony is obtained when the\r\nsame shape is repeated throughout the various parts of the\r\nbuilding,--the cylinder in the columns, the triangle or semicircle in\r\nthe arches and gables. A step further is taken in the same direction\r\nwhen the different similar parts are all of the same size, as in the\r\nGreek temple, where the columns are all of one size, and similar parts\r\nof columns of equal size, and the metopes and triglyphs likewise.\r\n\r\nA more complex type of harmony, since it admits of greater variety,\r\nis proportionality. Proportionality may be of various kinds. It may\r\nbe merely the existence of a definite numerical relation between the\r\ndimensions of single parts, or the areas of various parts, of a\r\nbuilding. This, in turn, may be either a simple arithmetical relation,\r\nsuch as exists between the parts of a Greek facade, each being some\r\nsimple multiple of the unit or module; or a more complex relation like\r\nthe Golden Section, where the smaller is to the larger dimension as\r\nthe larger is to the sum of both; or like that which obtains when\r\ndifferent parts form a geometrical series, where each is smaller or\r\nlarger than the preceding by some fraction of the latter. The relation\r\nbetween the length and breadth of the facade of the Ducal Palace in\r\nFlorence illustrates the Golden Section; the heights of the stories\r\nof the Peller House in Nuremberg form a geometrical series. This type\r\nof harmony is most complete when the proportion between the dimensions\r\nof the different parts is the same as that of the whole building,--by\r\nthe ancients called _concinnitas_ because it produces a feeling\r\nakin to that of musical harmony. Dominance of a particular kind of\r\nline, horizontal or vertical, also gives harmony. Finally, harmony is\r\nsecured by sameness of direction of line: the alignment of windows or\r\nparallelism between moldings dividing the surfaces of walls, for\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nThe relations, so seemingly mathematical, upon which architectural\r\nharmony is based, need not be exact, for two reasons: minor deviations\r\nare not perceptible, and even when perceptible, they give to the whole\r\na feeling of life. Our experience with living things has taught us\r\nthat, despite their orderliness, there is no exact mathematical\r\nregularity in their proportions; hence forms which cannot be precisely\r\nformulated are better fitted to symbolize life to us than the rigidly\r\ngeometrical. The same experience has taught us that the curvilinear\r\nforms are closer to life than the angular; hence again the tendency,\r\nfor aesthetic purposes, to introduce minute departures from the\r\nplumb-line and rule. There is, however, a type of life specifically\r\nhuman, the life of reason, which is best symbolized by mathematical\r\nrelations; hence the Greeks, and all those who have followed the\r\nclassical ideal, all who have had a passion for reason, have felt the\r\ncircle and the square, and every other exact embodiment of clarity and\r\nintelligence, to be beautiful. In no other art has the passion for the\r\nintelligible been so perfectly expressed as in classical architecture.\r\n\r\nNext in importance to harmony as a mode of unity in variety in\r\narchitecture is balance. Balance implies emphatic variety, or contrast.\r\nOne mode of balance, that between the upward and the downward\r\ntendencies, we have already discussed. There is another mode, similar\r\nto that which exists in painting and sculpture, the balance between\r\nthe right and left members of a building. In order that this type of\r\nbalance may be appreciated, there must be some axis or line of mediation\r\nbetween the parts, from which the opposing tendencies take their start;\r\notherwise we view the parts together, instead of in opposition. For\r\nexample, there is balance between two wings of a building which are\r\nseparated by some central member or link; balance between the aisles\r\nof a church on either side of the nave; balance between the sets of\r\nthree columns right and left of the door in the Greek hexastyle temple.\r\nSuch cases of symmetry between equal right and left parts are the\r\nsimplest examples of balance; but there are other, more complex types.\r\nFor example, the parts may be unequal, yet balance nevertheless,\r\nprovided their inequality is compensated for by some enrichment of\r\ndesign or ornament in the lesser part. Or again, there may be a balance\r\nbetween contrasting shapes, such as the square and the triangle, when\r\nthey make an equal claim upon the attention.\r\n\r\nAlthough, since architecture is a static art, evolution is not so\r\nimportant as harmony and balance, it exists nevertheless. In a\r\ncolonnade, as you look down it, with the height of the columns\r\ndiminishing in perspective, there is a rhythmical movement of eye and\r\nattention toward the last column as a goal. There is the same rhythmical\r\nmovement in following the arches on either side of the nave of a church\r\nleading to the apse.\r\n\r\nThere is a rhythmical movement in the progressive diminution of the\r\nheight of the stories of a building, going towards the top. In such\r\nspatio-temporal rhythms, the proportional equality between the members\r\ncorresponds to the equal intervals in temporal rhythms, and the\r\nalternation between member and intervening space, or between member\r\nand line of division, corresponds to the alternation between heavy and\r\nlight accents. Last, evolution is present in architecture, whenever,\r\noften without rhythmical divisions, the attention is impelled to move\r\nalong lines that meet at a point which serves as a climax, as in all\r\ntriangular forms where the lines lead up to the apex,--pointed windows\r\nor arches, towers ending in belfries or pinnacles.\r\n\r\nDominance, with its correlative, subordination, are everywhere present\r\nin architecture. In general, size and a central position, which usually\r\ngo together, determine preeminence. The largest masses and those which\r\noccupy a central position inevitably rule the others. The towers and\r\nthe facade dominate the exterior of a Gothic cathedral, the middle\r\ndoorway is superior to those which flank it, and within, the central\r\nand larger nave dominates the smaller aisles on either side. When there\r\nare many dominant elements, as is necessarily the case in a large\r\nbuilding, they must be unified by balance, if there are two, or by\r\nsubordination to one of them, if three or more; otherwise, each claims\r\nto be the whole and the building falls apart into its members. There\r\ncannot well be three vertical dominant parts, because the central one\r\nmakes a claim to preeminence which cannot be satisfied without\r\nsuperiority in size. A central member should, therefore, either be\r\nmade larger than those flanking it, or else should be reduced to the\r\nstatus of a mere subordinate link between the others.\r\n\r\nIn the horizontal division of a building into stories--as, for example,\r\nin the Palazzo Farnese near Rome--it is easier for the prominent parts\r\nto be equal, because they are better united by the evident contiguity\r\nof their masses, by their inclosure in a simple geometrical shape, and\r\nenframement between base and overhanging cornice. Yet here also we\r\nobserve the tendency to make the middle larger or otherwise dominant,\r\nexemplified even in the building cited, where the central part is\r\ndistinguished by the ornamental shield, upon which the attention is\r\nfocused. When there are four horizontal divisions, our tendency is to\r\ndivide them into groups of two; but unless this grouping is clearly\r\nmarked by a molding or other such device, our purpose is defeated\r\nbecause each of the two can itself be divided into two parts, whence\r\nwe get the four parts again, among which there is not sufficient unity.\r\nWhen, however, there are more than four stories, they cease to function\r\nas individuals and become members of a series, the rhythm of which\r\ncreates the necessary unity. Even in this case, however, the tendency\r\ntoward grouping into three with the middle dominant persists; for, as\r\na rule, the stories are divided by moldings into three parts, of which\r\nthe central part is the largest. Four equal stories are difficult\r\nbecause they at once resist an arrangement into threes and yet fall\r\nshort of being the series which they suggest. When a series of stories\r\nis divided into three parts, a superior aesthetic effect is gained if\r\nthe height of each story diminishes in some regular ratio from the\r\nbottom to the top, thus expressing the gradual overcoming of the\r\ndownward force by the upward,--the rhythm becomes dynamical as well\r\nas kinematical.\r\n\r\nAll good architectural styles illustrate the principle of impartiality,\r\nwhich demands the careful elaboration of parts. Yet, as we have\r\nindicated, there are two possibilities: some styles are founded on the\r\nidea of the subordination of the parts to the whole, and so permit of\r\na less elaborate execution of details, while others are based on the\r\nidea of coordination among the parts within the whole, and so require\r\nthat each part be vividly clear, distinct from the others, and possessed\r\nof a pronounced individual beauty. These two types are exemplified in\r\neach of the three aspects of a building--the visual, the dynamic, and\r\nthe voluminal. For the Greek and Roman architecture and for that of\r\nthe Renaissance, the former was the ideal; while the latter is clearly\r\ncharacteristic of the more modern forms; between these stand the\r\nByzantine, Romanesque, and Gothic, in which a union of the two types,\r\nin what has well been called an organic type, was attempted, and perhaps\r\nachieved in the last. The former has the feeling of the mechanical,\r\nrational view of life, which is the classical; the latter has the\r\nfeeling of the mystical and organic view, which is modern.[Footnote:\r\nSee P. Frankl, _Die Entwieklungsphasen der neueren Baukunst_, 1914.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE FUNCTION OF ART: ART AND MORALITY\r\n\r\n\r\nThat an interest is innocent and pleasure giving is no longer considered\r\nsufficient to justify its existence; it must also, in order to be\r\nsanctioned in our jealous and economical world, prove itself a\r\nbeneficent influence upon the total man and the group. For the time\r\nbeing at least, the day of _laissez-faire_ is done; men can no\r\nlonger appeal to their personal needs, their inner necessities, or\r\neven their consciences, in defense of their activities. Public opinion,\r\nand sometimes reason, are the only arbiters of right. It may well\r\nhappen that, in a new age, men will be more generous and less exacting,\r\nonce again recognizing inherent rights in spontaneous activities; but\r\nthat age is not ours. Not even art can claim privilege; in vain will\r\nthe artist boast of his genius or the art-lover of his delights, if\r\nhe can exhibit no pervasive good. It is not enough, therefore, that\r\nwe should have described the peculiar, inward value of art; we must\r\nfurther establish that it has a function in the general life.\r\n\r\nThree classes of people, the puritans, the philistines, and the\r\nproletarians, question the value of art in this sense. These classes\r\nare, of course, not new to our civilization, but are rather perennial\r\ntypes of human nature, appearing under one or another name and guise\r\nin every age. To the puritan, art is immoral; to the philistine, it\r\nis useless; to the proletarian, it is a cruel waste.\r\n\r\nOne illustration of the complexity of human culture is the fact that\r\nart has now been regarded as the symbol and ally of goodness, and now\r\nas its enemy. This paradox can, I think, be partly explained by making\r\na distinction between the ethical and the moral point of view regarding\r\nconduct. From the one point of view, the good belongs to all free,\r\ncreative acts that look toward the growth and happiness of individuals;\r\nfrom the other point of view, it consists in conformity to law,\r\nconvention, and custom. It is evident that these two attitudes must\r\nsometimes come into open or secret conflict. For law and convention\r\nrepresent either an effort to fix and stabilize modes of conduct that\r\nhave proved themselves to be good under certain conditions; or else,\r\nas is more often true than is admitted, an attempt to generalize the\r\ngood of some special class or type of men and impose it as a norm for\r\nall; and obviously these efforts will, from time to time, be opposed\r\neither to the freedom of individuals, or to their growth, under changing\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nNow in the sense defined, the spirit of art is fundamentally ethical\r\nand, at the same time, fundamentally non-moral. It is fundamentally\r\nethical, for art is itself a freely creative and happy activity, and\r\ntends to propagate itself in spontaneity in other fields; it is an\r\ninspiration in every struggle for liberty and the remolding of the\r\nworld. The artist and art lover, who value the expression of\r\nindividuality in art, cannot fail to appreciate it outside of art. On\r\nthe other hand, the spirit of art is fundamentally non-moral, for the\r\nsthetic attitude is one of sympathy--an attempt at once to express\r\nlife and to feel at one with it; it demands of us that we take the\r\npoint of view of the life expressed and, for the moment at any rate,\r\nrefrain from a merely external judgment. Through art we are compelled\r\nto sympathize with the aspiration towards growth, towards happiness,\r\neven when it leads to rebellion against our own standards and towards\r\nwhat we call sin. The sympathy, realism, and imagination of art are\r\nantagonistic to conformist morality. By making us intimately acquainted\r\nwith individuals, art leads to skepticism of all general rules.\r\n\r\nThe puritan, therefore, who is an exponent of the extremest and\r\nnarrowest conformist morality, is more nearly right in his\r\ninterpretation of the relation between art and morality than more\r\nliberal people who, because of their love of art, seek to ignore or\r\npalliate the facts. Hence, in order to defend art, one must reckon\r\nseriously with the puritan.\r\n\r\nThe puritan is fearful, above all, of works of art that represent moral\r\nevil. The method of artistic representation, which aims at awakening\r\nsympathy for the life portrayed, is bound, he thinks, to demoralize\r\nboth the artist and the spectator. But art is something more than\r\nsympathy, and there are other aspects of the aesthetic experience which\r\ntend to render that sympathy innocuous, even from the standpoint of\r\nthe puritan. In the first place, the sympathy is usually with an\r\nimagined life that has no direct relation to the will and gives the\r\nspectator no opportunity to enter into and share it--he participates\r\nthrough the imagination, not through the senses. Moreover, neither the\r\nmind nor the will is a _tabula rasa_; no mature person comes to\r\na work of art without certain habits and preferences already\r\npredetermined, which no mere imagination can destroy, but only, if at\r\nall, some concrete opportunity and temptation. Hence men can lead a\r\nmanifold life, partly in the imagination and partly in action, without\r\nany corruption of heart or paralysis of will. In real conduct, to lead\r\na double life is demoralizing because there choices are exclusive and\r\neach of the two lives tends to interfere with and spoil the other; but\r\nimagination does not conflict with reality, for they have no point of\r\ncontact and do not belong to the same world.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, a work of art is an appeal to mind as well as to\r\nsympathetic feeling. It is no mere stirring of emotion and passion,\r\nbut a means to insight into them. The attitude of reflection which it\r\nengenders is unfavorable to impetuous action. Providing no immediate\r\nstimulus to action, it allows time for a better second thought to\r\nintervene. Even when it offers suggestions for unwonted acts, it\r\nfurnishes the spirit and the knowledge requisite for determining whether\r\nthey will fit into the scheme of life of the spectator. It is\r\ncharacteristic of the puritanic critics of art, in their eagerness to\r\nfind motives for condemnation, to overlook this element of reflection.\r\n\r\nIt is forgotten, finally, that by providing an imaginative experience\r\nof passion and adventure, art often becomes rather a substitute for\r\nthan an incentive to them. The perfection of form, the deep repose and\r\ncircle-like completeness of the work of art, tend to prevent one from\r\nseeking a corresponding real experience, which would have none of these\r\nqualities, but perhaps only misery and wear and tear instead. Thus the\r\nwork of art may propagate itself in a search for new aesthetic\r\nexperiences rather than in analogous conduct.\r\n\r\nTo the artist who is living the evil life which he expresses, there\r\ncan be even less danger in expression, than to the spectator. For the\r\nexpression is not the cause of his life, but only its efflorescence.\r\nThe roots of evil lie deep below in the subsoil of instinct. Without\r\nexpression, life would be much the same, only secret instead of\r\narticulate. The puritan shows a shocking naivete in thinking that he\r\ncan reform life by destroying its utterance. Moreover, to express life\r\nimplies a certain mastery over it, a power of detachment and reflection,\r\nwhich are fundamentally ethical and may lead to a new way of living.\r\n\r\nEvery form of life has an inalienable right to expression. In order\r\nto be judged fairly, it must be allowed to plead for itself, and art\r\nis its best spokesman. And that we should know life sympathetically\r\nis of practical importance; for otherwise we shall not know how to\r\nchange it or indeed that it ought to be changed at all. Only by knowing\r\nother ways of life can we be certain of the relative worth of our own\r\nway; knowledge alone gives certitude. Without knowledge we run the\r\nrisk of becoming ruthless destroyers of things which an intelligent\r\nsympathy might well preserve and find a place for in the world.\r\n\r\nTo all these considerations the puritan will doubtless oppose a truth\r\nimpossible to deny. Experience, he will say, is one, not many;\r\nimagination and action are not separated by an impassable wall; things\r\nmerely imagined or dreamed, even when they do not directly issue in\r\naction, may nevertheless influence conduct through a slow and subtle\r\ntransforming effect upon the sentiments and valuations which make up\r\nits background. Character can be maintained only by a vigilant and\r\nsteady control over impulses which are always threatening rebellion;\r\npurity of mind only through the rigid exclusion of the sensual,\r\nluxurious, and ignoble; imaginative sympathy with evil, even when\r\nsublimated in art, must necessarily undermine the one and becloud the\r\nother. \"If thine eye offend thee, cut it out and cast it from thee.\"\r\n\r\nThe truth which the puritan announces does not, I think, warrant the\r\ninference which he draws from it or alter the situation as I have\r\ndescribed it. For morality, to be genuine, must be a choice; the good\r\nmust know its alternative or it is not good. Only those who already\r\nhave a penchant for sin will be corrupted by imaginative sympathy with\r\npassion; a character that cannot resist such an influence is already\r\nundermined. Life itself is the great temptation; how can one who cannot\r\nlook with equanimity upon statues and pictures fail to be seduced by\r\nlive men and women? If men can resist the suggestions that emanate\r\nfrom life they can surely withstand those that come from art. And mere\r\npurity of mind is not equal in value to that insight into the whole\r\nof life which a freely creative art provides. We wish to penetrate\r\nsympathetically all of our existence; nothing human shall remain foreign\r\nto us; we would enter into it all; there is no region of the grotesque,\r\nthe infernal, or the sinful from which we would be shut out. In\r\ncomparison with the sublimity of this demand for the complete\r\nappreciation of life, the warnings of a rigorous moralism seem timorous,\r\nand the sanctuary of purity in which it would have us take refuge, a\r\nprison.\r\n\r\nWhatever conflict there may be between the spirit of art and conformist\r\nmorality, there is none with a genuine and rational ethics. For the\r\nlatter would formulate ways of living suited to the diversity of\r\nindividuals and sympathetic with their every impulse and fancy. It\r\nwould impose external constraint only where necessary for the existence\r\nand perpetuation of social life, leaving to personal tact, good will,\r\nand temperance the finer adjustments of strain. But apart from aesthetic\r\nculture, there can be no rational morality, for that alone engenders\r\nthe imaginative sympathy with individual diversity upon which the\r\nlatter rests. Without imaginative sympathy morality will always be\r\ncoarse, ruthless, and expressive of the needs and sentiments of some\r\nspecial type which sets out to reform or govern the world. Under such\r\na regimen, which is actual in every community devoid of imagination,\r\nvirtue must always remain suspect and vice tolerable; the one a\r\nhypocrisy, the other a secret and venial indulgence, and nature will\r\ntake its revenge upon the law in violent or perverse compensations.\r\nHence, instead of being a hindrance, art ought to be a help to a\r\nrational morality: its realism should foster sincerity, its imagination,\r\nsympathy and justice. The moralist inspired by art would seek to impose\r\nupon men only that kind of form and order which is characteristic of\r\nart--one which respects the peculiarities of the material with which\r\nit works, and issues in a system in which all elements freely\r\nparticipate. [Footnote: Compare Schiller, _On the Aesthetic Education\r\nof Man_, Fourth Letter: \"The civilized man makes nature his friend,\r\nand honors her freedom, while he merely fetters her caprice.\"]\r\n\r\nThe philistine's objection to art is that it is useless. And if we\r\nonly knew what was really useful, this would be a damning indictment.\r\nBut, not being much given to abstract reflection, the philistine is\r\nusually at a loss to inform us. However, by talking with him, we can\r\neventually divine what he thinks the useful to be. Useful is what\r\ncontributes to the procurement of those things which he and his\r\ncongeners value--material wealth, power, and sensual enjoyment. Art\r\nis useless because it will not prepare a banquet, build a bridge, or\r\nhelp to run a business corporation. The artist is a contemptible fellow\r\nbecause he cares more for his art than for the things of the world;\r\nfor whatever the worldling values he thinks every one else should\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nTo the artist, criticism of this kind seems to betray the most shameless\r\narrogance, and he meets contempt with contempt. Who is he that would\r\nbe the judge between worldly goods and beauty? Surely the philistine\r\nis no competent judge; for he only can judge fairly between two values\r\nwho appreciates both, and, by his own confession, the philistine does\r\nnot appreciate art. Hence the claim of the philistine seems not to\r\nmerit consideration. Through his lack of sympathy for art, he puts\r\nhimself beyond the possibility of fruitful debate. In this he is unlike\r\nthe puritan, who is often all too sensitive to beauty for his own\r\ngood--hence his alarms.\r\n\r\nIf the objection of the philistine were the same as the proletarian's,\r\nthat art is a luxury, a waste of the energies of the community, which\r\nmight better be employed in feeding the hungry and saving sinners, it\r\nwould be more worthy of a hearing; and so he often represents it. But\r\nin this he is hardly sincere; and the appropriate answer is a _tu\r\nquoque_, the fitting reply to every piece of insincere criticism.\r\nDoes the philistine feed the poor and save the sinners? Who is commonly\r\nmore careless of the workers' needs and more cruel to the fallen in\r\nhis self-righteous probity? For the philistine is often a puritan.\r\nAnd who is more luxurious than he? Who consumes more in his own person\r\nof the energies of the toilers? It costs little to maintain an artist,\r\nbut it taxes thousands to support the philistine and his wife. Of\r\ncourse, in return, the worldling performs a service to the community\r\nin the organization of industries, but many of these do not sustain\r\nthe needs of the masses and are devoted to the manufacture of luxuries\r\nfor the well-to-do.\r\n\r\nThe insincerity of the philistine's attitude is disclosed by his changed\r\nattitude towards the artist who acquires fame and wealth through his\r\nart. For now that the artist shows himself capable of getting the\r\nthings the philistine values, the latter accords him esteem. Or let\r\nan interest in art become fashionable, and once again the philistine\r\nis won over.\r\n\r\nThe traditional hostility between the philistine and the artist is\r\noffensive to reason, which would discover points of contact and\r\nreconciliation between all attitudes. One apparent place of meeting\r\nmight seem to be just the worldling's love of luxury itself. Luxury\r\nis a development of pleasure of sense beyond the necessary, paralleling\r\nthe freedom and refinement of sensation in art. There is, moreover,\r\na certain imaginative quality in reputation and glory, so well-prized\r\nby the worldling, which, as we shall see, is akin to the ideality of\r\nart. And yet both the imagination and the luxury of the worldling are\r\nusually lacking in one element essential to real kinship with the\r\nspirit of art--disinterestedness. The worldling's dreams of glory are\r\nprojections of ambition, his luxuries subtle stimulations of appetite\r\nor instruments of display, her self-adornment a fine self-exhibition\r\nor coquetry. The love of insight, the free emotion, the enjoyment of\r\nsensuous harmonies for their own sake, are lacking or subordinate.\r\nGlory and luxury are too often mere masks of ambition and appetite,\r\nand at best counterfeits of beauty. Nevertheless, the luxurious\r\ndevelopments of ambition and appetite are ever on the verge of tending\r\ntoward the aesthetic. For when ambition has no longer to struggle against\r\nthe world and is satisfied, the imagination that served it may become\r\nfree; and when appetite is cloyed, the instrumentalities of sensuous\r\npleasure can find a new meaning as beautiful. Then the worldling becomes\r\nthe patron of the artist and the two are reconciled. And all along\r\nthis result was preparing. For instinct seldom completely dominates\r\nimagination and sensation; there is always some aesthetic freedom in\r\nthe self-adornment and display of the wealthy. The absence of anxiety\r\nmay release aesthetic interests that would have died in the struggle\r\nfor existence; prosperity is often the herald of beauty.\r\n\r\nThe proletarian's criticism of art is of unimpeachable sincerity, for\r\nwhen he talks of art as a luxury he speaks from the heart and in answer\r\nto bitter experience of want. There is a genuine element of moral\r\nindignation in his feeling that there must be something wrong with a\r\npublic conscience that countenances, even glorifies extravagance, all\r\nthe while that women slave and children die of underfeeding and neglect.\r\nThis feeling is intensified when he compares the thousands paid for\r\na single hour of a prima donna's song or a playwright's wit with his\r\nown yearly wage laboriously earned. What supreme worth does art possess\r\nthat it should be valued so disproportionately?\r\n\r\nYet, sincere as this complaint is, it is largely misdirected; for art\r\nis not the extravagance which it may superficially seem to be. Most\r\nof the best art has been produced by poor men who never dreamed of the\r\nprices that would be paid for their work when they were old or after\r\nthey were dead. And these prices represent no consumption of the labor\r\nand capital of the community, but only a transference of wealth from\r\none man to another. Even when the artist is paid large sums for his\r\npicture or opera or play, these sums do not represent their real cost,\r\nbut only what they can command in a market controlled by rich consumers.\r\nThe real cost of genuine art is very small--only enough to maintain\r\nthe artist in freedom for his work; for he would still produce without\r\nthe incentive of large rewards. The seeming extravagance of art cannot,\r\ntherefore, be blamed upon art itself, but upon the price system of\r\nmodern capitalist economy. And this, of course, is clearly perceived\r\nby the \"intellectual proletarians,\" who are willing to accord to the\r\nartist a place of honor as fellow-worker and \"comrade,\" and direct\r\ntheir attacks, not upon him, but upon capitalism.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a deeper root to the proletarian's grievance against\r\nthe artist--the feeling that the moral principle of mutuality is\r\nviolated in their relationship. The workman plows for him, cooks for\r\nhim, builds for him, spins for him, but what does he do in return? He\r\npaints pictures, makes statues, writes novels or poems or plays or\r\nsonatas which the workman has neither the leisure nor the education\r\nto enjoy. The money paid by the artist to the artisan represents nothing\r\nwhich the former rightfully owns or can give, but only a claim to the\r\nlabor of other men, enforced by the system of wage-economy. Of course,\r\nnot only art but all speculation, all pure science and disinterested\r\nhistorical knowledge, is subject to this criticism. And such criticism\r\nis no longer purely academic, for to-day there exist large masses of\r\nmen in every community determined to bring about a \"world dictatorship\r\nof the proletariat\" based on just this principle of mutuality in the\r\nrelations of men. Is this principle itself rational, and would art\r\nsurvive in a regime which embodied it? These, I repeat, are no longer\r\nspeculative, but intensely practical problems.\r\n\r\nThose who fear for art in a society where the process of democratization\r\nshould go to its extreme limit of development point to the moving\r\npicture, the cheap magazine story and novel, the vaudeville and\r\n\"musical\" comedy, as a hint of what to expect. These, they will say,\r\nare the popular forms of art, to the production of which the artist\r\nwould have to devote his time and skill in return for subsistence.\r\nUnder the present system the people get what they want, but in a\r\nproletarian state nobody would be allowed to get anything else.\r\n\r\nOf course, as to what would happen in a workers' republic, were it\r\never constituted, we can only speculate; but where we cannot know,\r\nthere hope has an equal chance with fear. We have the single example\r\nof the Russian experiment from which to make inferences, the general\r\nvalidity of which is seriously limited by the peculiarities of the\r\nRussian nature and situation. But there, at any rate, we do know that\r\nefforts have been made to advance general education, to bring the\r\nclassic literature within reach of the masses, and to encourage opera\r\nand drama. In Russia, at all events, the leaders of the revolutionary\r\nmovement have sought rather to destroy what they believe to be a\r\nmonopoly of culture than culture itself; and in England also they have\r\na similar aim.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt, I think, that our capitalist economy does\r\npromote a monopoly of culture. Through their control of the market,\r\nthe wealthy are able to bid up the prices of works of art until they\r\nare beyond the reach of the less prosperous. As a result, the best\r\npaintings and sculptures, with the exception of those that find their\r\nway into museums, are accumulated in inaccessible private collections,\r\nand opera and music are made needlessly expensive. One very evil\r\nconsequence is the substitution of a purely pecuniary standard of\r\nvaluation for aesthetic standards. I know a painter who made the\r\nexperiment of reducing the price of his pictures to twenty-five dollars,\r\nin the hope that many people who really loved art but were unable to\r\npay large prices would buy them, and that thus, by selling many of his\r\npictures at a low price, he would be able to make as much money as if\r\nhe sold only a few at the prevailing high rates. The experiment failed\r\ncompletely, for people thought that paintings at such a low price must\r\nbe inferior, and even those who could afford to buy them, would not.\r\nThe painter now tried the reverse experiment and raised the prices of\r\nall his works, with much better success, for people reasoned--the\r\nhigher the price, the better the picture. But worst of all, through\r\nthe purely commercial motives governing those who undertake to supply\r\nthe people with works of art, the public taste is corrupted; little\r\nor no attempt is made to educate the masses, but merely to give them\r\nanything that will entertain them after a day of fatiguing\r\nlabor,--anything that will sell. The demoralizing effect of\r\ncommercialism upon artists themselves is too well known to require\r\nmore than a reminder; hasty work for the sake of money supplants careful\r\nwork for the sake of beauty; whole arts, like that of oriental rug\r\nweaving, are thereby threatened with extinction; and, instead of\r\nproducing spontaneous art that would express themselves, people allow\r\nthemselves to be merely entertained by things supplied to them, nasty\r\nand cheap--folk art disappears.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the commercial motive were eliminated, who can\r\nsay what might not result, in each community, from the experimentation\r\nof men who could not make money but only honor and a living from the\r\nprofession of providing people with interesting ways of spending their\r\nleisure. The increased efficiency of machine tool work will inevitably\r\nmake possible a great reduction in hours of labor, when the workers\r\nthemselves control industry for their own benefit rather than for that\r\nof a class bent on still further increasing its own wealth and power.\r\nIt is entirely possible that the leisure of men will then absorb as\r\nmuch of their devoted energies as work does now, and that they will\r\nbe educated for the one as well as for the other. It is not impossible\r\nto hope that, the machine tool supplanting the slave, the commonwealth\r\nof workers will develop as free and liberal a life as existed among\r\nthe citizens of ancient Greece. Then perhaps each group will have its\r\npainters, actors, and musicians just as surely as it now has its judges,\r\naldermen, and police.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to judge what art might do for people in a reorganized\r\nsociety by what it does for them now. Art has its roots in interests\r\nthat are well nigh universal. Everybody loves to dance, to sing, to\r\ntell a story; everybody loves either to paint or be painted, to\r\nsculpture or be sculptured. Again, everybody is at least potentially\r\nsensitive to rhythm, harmony, and balance, and to the beauties of\r\nlines, colors, and tones. It is not native incapacity, but rather a\r\nfailure in aesthetic education due to the one-sided emphasis on work\r\nrather than play, industry rather than leisure, success rather than\r\nhappiness, that is responsible for much of the seeming lack of artistic\r\nappreciation among the masses. Under a different social system the\r\npeople may come to recognize the artist as a fellow-worker, elaborating\r\nhis products in exchange for other desirable things, and may accord\r\nhim welcome rather than envy.\r\n\r\nHowever, it will doubtless always remain true that the subtler and\r\nmore intellectual types of art can never become popular. Like higher\r\nmathematics, they will continue to be completely intelligible only to\r\nthe few. Yet I can conceive of no social system likely to grow out of\r\nmodern tendencies that would suppress them. The artist in the new state\r\nwould have his leisure, as other men would, in which he could devote\r\nhimself to the refinements of his art. It is doubtful whether he would\r\nhave less time for that then than he has now. How many artists under\r\nour present system waste a large part of their lives doing hack work\r\nof various kinds to make a living; only the fortunate few are masters\r\nof themselves. Moreover, under any social system, men would be permitted\r\nto spend their surplus income as they chose, and the art lovers of the\r\nfuture are as likely to spend it for art then as now. Not being so\r\nrich, they could not reward the artist so munificently as some are\r\nrewarded now; but even now most working artists are poor, and the\r\nimpulse to art is independent of large rewards. Heretical and unpopular\r\nartists, who could find no public backing, would come to be supported\r\nby their own special clients, as they are to-day. In a complex rational\r\nsociety, the principle of mutuality would be transitive rather than\r\nstrictly symmetrical--a woman would cook for a machine designer although\r\nshe got no machine in return, provided the designer made one, say, for\r\nthe shoemaker, who could thus supply her with shoes. Just so, there\r\nis no moral objection to the artist's receiving goods and services\r\nfrom people to whose life he contributes nothing personally, so long\r\nas these people are compensated by those whose life he does enrich.\r\nIn other words, part of the reward which the art lover would receive\r\nfor the work he performed would be paid, not to himself, but to the\r\nartist--art would be voluntarily supported by those who appreciated\r\nit. No complex social life could be maintained under the principle of\r\nstrict mutuality, and certainly no system that undertook to preserve\r\nthe variety and spontaneity of human interests. Only a complete\r\ndead-level regimentation of human life in accordance with the average\r\ndesires of the masses, which is unlikely, would destroy the more\r\nintellectual and subtle types of art, and, by the same token,\r\nspeculation and disinterested higher learning. The higher culture has\r\nsurvived many revolutions; it will survive the next, when it comes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE FUNCTION OF ART: ART AND RELIGION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe distinctive purpose of art, so we have argued throughout this\r\nstudy, is culture, the enrichment of the spirit. But lovers of art\r\nhave always claimed for it more active and broader influences. To my\r\nthinking, most of such claims, especially in our age, like similar\r\nclaims for religion, are greatly exaggerated. Passion, convention,\r\neconomic fact in the largest sense, practical intelligence, these are\r\nthe dominant forces swaying men, not beauty, not religion. Indeed, one\r\nwho would compare the influence of art upon life at the present time\r\nwith its influence upon primitive societies might infer the early\r\nextinction of that influence altogether. For among primitive men the\r\ninfluence of art is all-pervading. With them art is inseparable from\r\nutility and communal activities, upon which it has an immediate\r\nmodifying or strengthening effect. The movement of civilization, with\r\nthe exception of the Greek, mediaval, and renaissance city states, has\r\ninvolved a breaking away from this original unity until, among\r\nourselves, art is developed and enjoyed in isolation from the rest of\r\nlife. Art is valued for its own sake, for its contribution to culture,\r\nnot for any further influence upon life, and this freedom has come to\r\nbe part of its very meaning. Instead of being interested only in\r\npictures and statues representing ourselves, our rulers, our gods, or\r\nour neighborhood, we enjoy imitations of people who have had no effect\r\nupon our lives whatever and scenes which we have never visited, and\r\nwe repair to museums to see them; instead of employing music to beautify\r\nour daily life, we leave that life for the concert hall, where we shut\r\nourselves away for a few hours of \"absolute\" musical experience. Prose\r\nliterature and the drama, when inspired by contemporary social problems,\r\noffer exceptions to this isolation, for through their ability to express\r\nideas they can exert a more pervasive influence. Although social\r\nproblems are solved in obedience to forces and demands beyond the\r\ncontrol of artists, literary expression is effective in persuading and\r\ndrawing into a movement men whose status would tend to make them hostile\r\nor indifferent, as in Russia, where numerous men and women of the\r\naristocratic and wealthy classes became revolutionaries by reason of\r\nliterature. And yet the literary arts also have acquired a large measure\r\nof isolation and independence. A play representing Viennese life is\r\nappreciated in New York, a novel of contemporary manners in England\r\nis enjoyed in America. Literature does not depend for its interest\r\nupon its ability to interpret and influence the life that the reader\r\nhimself lives; he values it more because it extends than because it\r\nreflects that life. People decry art for art's sake, but in vain.\r\n\r\nThe development of the relation of religion to life has been parallel\r\nto the development of art. Originally, religion penetrated every\r\nactivity; now, by contrast, it has been removed from one after another\r\nof the major human pursuits. Agriculture, formerly undertaken under\r\nthe guidance of religion; science, once the prerogative of the\r\npriesthood; art, at one time inseparable from worship; politics, once\r\ngoverned by the church and pretending a divine sanction; war, until\r\nyesterday waged with the fancied cooperation of the gods--even these\r\nare now under complete secular control. To be sure, there is some\r\nmusic, sculpture, painting, and poetry still in the service of religion,\r\nbut its relative proportion is small; kings and congresses still appeal\r\nfor divine aid in times of crisis, but that is perfunctory; men still\r\npray for rain during drought, but without faith. No one would pretend\r\nthat our commerce and manufacturing have any direct relation to\r\nreligion. People still invoke divine authority for moral prescriptions,\r\nbut the sanctions actually operating are social instincts and fear of\r\npublic opinion and the law. Religion retains a direct and potent\r\ninfluence only in the institution of marriage, the experience of death,\r\nphilosophy, and the social life and charities conducted by the churches.\r\nYet even in these spheres the influence is declining, and, so far as\r\nit persists, is becoming indirect. Civil and contractual marriage are\r\nslowly supplanting religious marriage; there are thousands living in\r\nour large cities who do not feel the need of the church to establish\r\nand cement their social life; most philosophers disclaim any religious\r\nmotive or authority for their investigations or beliefs. Only over\r\ndeath does religion still hold undisputed sway.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite the separation of religion and art from life, they\r\nmay continue to exert influence upon it. But, barring some new\r\nintegration of the sundered elements of our culture, which we may\r\ndeeply desire but cannot predict, this influence must be indirect and\r\nsubtle, and must occur independent of any institutional control. In\r\nthe case of both it consists in imparting to life a new meaning and\r\nperfection, thus making possible a more complete affirmation of life\r\nand a freer and more genial attitude and conduct.\r\n\r\nFor unless the spirit of art or of religion is infused into life, we\r\nnever find it quite satisfactory. To be sure, men sometimes think they\r\nfind perfection in certain things--in practical or moral endeavor, in\r\nlove or in pleasure; but unless art or religion is mixed into them,\r\nthey always prove to be, in the end, disappointing. No practical purpose\r\nis ever quite successful; there is always some part of the plan left\r\nunaccomplished; and the success itself is only momentary, for time\r\neventually engulfs it and forgets it. Practical life does not produce\r\nany permanent and complete work; its task is done only to be done over\r\nagain; every house has to be repaired or torn down, every road rebuilt;\r\nevery invention is displaced by a new one. This is true even on the\r\nhigher planes of practical life, in political and social reconstruction.\r\nCertain evils may be removed, certain abuses remedied, but new ones\r\nalways arise to take their places; and even when the entire system is\r\nremodeled and men think that the day of freedom and justice has dawned\r\nat last, they find, after a generation, a new tyranny and a new\r\ninjustice. The movement of life makes it impossible for any plan to\r\nlong endure. Hence the disillusion, the feeling of futility that so\r\noften poisons the triumphs of practical men. And without the spirit\r\nof art or of religion even love does not satisfy. For imagination\r\ncreates the perfection of its object and, aside from institutional\r\nbonds fast loosening, a faith in the continued growth with one another\r\nand with a child, which is essentially religious, creates the permanence\r\nand meaning of its bond. Love's raptures, in so far as they are\r\ninstinctive, are, of course, independent of any view of life; but apart\r\nfrom imagination and faith in one another, love does not keep its\r\nquality or renew itself in memory, nor can it survive death which\r\nalways impends to destroy. Men often seek escape from the feeling of\r\nimperfection in frivolity, but ennui is the inevitable consequence,\r\nand reflection with its doubts cannot be stilled.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, in the religious experience and in beauty men feel that\r\nthey find perfection; hence the attitude of self-surrender and\r\njoyousness characterizing both. The abandon of the spectator who decrees\r\nthat for the moment his life shall be that of the work of art, is\r\nmatched in the mystical experience by the emotion expressed in Dante's\r\nline, \"In his will is our peace.\" And in both the self-surrender is\r\nbased on a felt harmony between the individual and the object--the\r\nbeautiful thing appeals to the senses, its form is adapted to the\r\nstructure of the mind, its content is such as to win interest and\r\nsympathy; the divine is believed to realize and quiet all of our\r\ndesires. But while in beauty we feel ourselves at home with the single\r\nobject, in religion we feel at rest in the universe.\r\n\r\nWhen religion and art are separated from the other parts of life, as\r\nthey are fast becoming now, the peculiar quality of the experiences\r\nwhich they offer can be rendered universal only by freely infusing it\r\neverywhere, through faith, in the case of the one, through imaginative\r\nre-creation, in the case of the other. The religious experience is a\r\nseeming revelation of a perfect meaning in life as a whole; this meaning\r\nmust now be imparted to the details of life. By a free act of faith\r\nthe scattered and imperfect fragments must be built into a purposive\r\nunity. The poisonous feeling of futility, will then be lost; each task,\r\nno matter how petty or ineffectual, will become momentous as\r\ncontributing something toward the realization of a good beyond our\r\nlittle existence; and we, however lowly, will find ourselves sublime\r\nas instruments of destiny. There is nothing vain to him who believes.\r\nAnd if the believer cannot build a meaning into history and social\r\nlife as he knows them empirically, he may extend them by faith in a\r\nfuture life, through which his purposes will be given the promise of\r\neternity and the tie between parents and children, friends and lovers\r\nand co-workers, an invincible seriousness and worth. Being at peace\r\nwith the universe, he may be reconciled to the accidents of his life\r\nas expressions of its Will.\r\n\r\nThe method of reconciliation through religion can well be understood\r\nby its effect on the attitude towards evil. To one who has faith in\r\nthe world as perfect, evil becomes an illusion that would disappear\r\nto an adequate vision of the Divine. The supposedly evil thing becomes\r\nreally a good thing--a necessary means to the fulfillment of the divine\r\nplan, either in the earthly progress of humanity or in the future life;\r\nor if the more mystical types of religion provide the starting point,\r\nwhere individuality itself is felt to be an illusion, a factor in the\r\nself-realization of the Absolute. The evil thing remains, of course,\r\nwhat it was, but the interpretation, and therefore the attitude towards\r\nit, is transformed. Pain, sorrow, and misfortune become agents for the\r\nquickening of the spirit, death a door opening to unending vistas.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of faith is not embodied in dogmatic and speculative\r\nreligious doctrines alone; for it finds expression in other beliefs--in\r\nprogress, in the possibility of a sunny social order, in the perpetuity\r\nof human culture, in the peculiar mission of one's race or country.\r\nSuch beliefs are expressions primarily of faith, not of knowledge;\r\nlike religion, they are interpretations of life based on aspiration,\r\nnot on evidence; and through them men secure the same sort of\r\nre-enforcement of motive, courage, and consolation that they derive\r\nfrom the doctrines called religious. But the sphere of faith is wider\r\neven than this; the almost instinctive belief that each man has in his\r\nown longevity and success, the trust in the permanence of friendship\r\nand love, the confidence in the unique value of one's work or\r\ngenius--these are also convictions founded more on desire than on\r\nknowledge, and may function in the same way as religion in a man's\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe re-affirmation of life which art may inspire is independent of any\r\nbelief or faith about the world. It occurs rather through the\r\napplication to the objects and incidents of life of a spirit and\r\nattitude borrowed from artistic creation and appreciation. It is a\r\ngeneralization of the aesthetic point of view to cover life as well\r\nas art; an attempt to bring beauty from art into the whole of life.\r\nAlthough to-day works of art themselves are severed from direct contact\r\nwith the rest of life, something of the intention and method of the\r\nartist may linger and be carried over into it. Art, the image of life,\r\nmay now serve as a model, after which the latter, in its turn, will\r\nbe patterned.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of art has two forms, one constructive, the other\r\ncontemplative, and both may be infused into life. When the former is\r\nput there, each act and task is performed as if it were a work of art.\r\nThis involves \"throwing the whole self\" into it, not only thought and\r\npatience, but enthusiasm and loving finish, even as the artist puts\r\nthem into his work, so that it becomes a happy self-expression. Nothing\r\nshall interfere with or mar it, or spoil its value when recalled. The\r\nimperfection and transiency of the result are then forgotten in the\r\ninspiration of endeavor; and the work or act, no matter how\r\ninsignificant, becomes perfect as an experience and as a memory. The\r\ngenerations may judge it as they will, but as an expression of the\r\nenergies of my own soul, it is divine. Of course, from the industry\r\nof our time, where most work is mechanical and meaningless to him who\r\nperforms it, the spirit of art has largely fled. Yet there still remain\r\ntasks which we all have to execute, if not in business, then at home,\r\nwhich, by arousing our interest and invention, may become materials\r\nfor the spirit of art. We have at least our homes, our pleasures, our\r\nrelations with one another, our private adventures, where we can still\r\nbe free and genial and masterly. And for our work, art will continue\r\nto be an ideal, sorrowfully appealing.\r\n\r\nThe scope of the spirit of art may be extended beyond the single task\r\nor act to embrace the whole of one's life. Impulse offers a plastic\r\nmaterial to which form may be given. The principles of harmony, balance,\r\nevolution, proper subordination, and perfection of detail, indispensable\r\nto beauty in art, are conditions of happiness in life. The form of a\r\nwork of art and the form of a happy life are the same, as Plato\r\ninsisted. [Footnote: See, for example, _The Gorgias_, 503, 504.]\r\nIn order to yield satisfaction, the different parts of life must\r\nexemplify identity of motive, continuity and orderliness in the\r\nfulfillment of purpose, lucidity of relation, yet diversity for\r\nstimulation and totality. There must be a selective scheme to absorb\r\nwhat is congenial and reject the unfit. This sense for form in life\r\nmay lead to the same results as morality, but the point of departure\r\nand the sanction are different. Morality is largely based on conformity,\r\non submission to the general will, and is rendered effective by fear\r\nof public disapproval and supernatural taboos; while the aesthetic\r\ndirection of life has its roots in the love of form and meaning, and\r\nits sanction in personal happiness. Moreover, to the reflective person,\r\nlooking before and after, life has the same sort of reality as a story,\r\nand is bound to be judged in some measure like a story. The past and\r\nthe future live only in the imagination, and when we survey them there\r\nthey may please us with their interest, liveliness, and meaning, much\r\nas a work of art would, or displease us with their vanity and chaos.\r\nIn this way personality may acquire an imaginative value fundamentally\r\naesthetic. This is different from moral value, which has reference to\r\nthe relation of a life to social ideals; it is more comprehensive than\r\nthe religious judgment, which is interested only in saving the soul;\r\nbecause it includes every element of life,--sense, imagination, and\r\nachievement, welcoming all, so long as they contribute something to\r\na significant, moving whole.\r\n\r\nThe feeling for perfection of form and imaginative meaning in life is\r\nno invention of philosophers and aesthetes, but part of the normal\r\nreaction to conduct. Everybody feels that certain acts, or even certain\r\nwishes, are to be rejected by himself, not because they are\r\nintrinsically bad or wrong, but because they are inconsistent with his\r\nparticular nature, and, on the other hand, that there are certain\r\ninterests that should be cultivated, not because they are universally\r\nright or good, but because they are needed to give his life complete\r\nmeaning. And again, all except the meanest and most repressed souls\r\ndesire somewhat to shine, if not in the world at large, at least among\r\ntheir friends, and act with a view to appearance and to some total\r\nsurvey of their lives that would consider not merely its goodness or\r\nusefulness, but its imaginative emotional appeal. This appeal is the\r\nstrongest on the death of a great man; this lives longest in the memory.\r\nThe love of the romantic and adventurous is partly instinctive, but\r\nlargely imaginative, for it has in view not merely the rapturous\r\npleasures of the hazardous moment, but the remembered delights of\r\nrecall and expression to others. The love of glory is also imaginative,\r\na feeling for the dramatic extending even beyond the grave. The\r\nambitious man seeks to make a story out of his life for posterity to\r\nread and remember, just as the artist makes one out of fictitious\r\nmaterial. More might develop out of this love of form and drama in\r\nlife. We have it to a certain degree of cultivation in picturesque and\r\nrefined manners, dress, and ceremonial, but even there it is hampered\r\nthrough conventionality and want of invention; further evolved and\r\nextended into the deeper strata of life, it would lead to a more\r\ninteresting and productive existence. Surely, if God is an artist as\r\nwell as a judge, he will welcome into heaven not only those who have\r\nlived well, but also those who have lived beautifully.\r\n\r\nThere is no necessity, finally, why the constructive spirit of art\r\nshould be confined to the personal life and should not, in some measure\r\nat least, penetrate the community and even the state. By appealing to\r\nimaginative feeling, the activities of various individuals and groups,\r\nwhen coordinated and given a purposeful unity, produce an aesthetic\r\neffect. The organization of a business or a university may easily come\r\nto have such a value for one who has helped to create it, especially\r\nif the place where the communal spirit operates is beautiful,--the\r\noffice, the campus, the shop. Seldom, to be sure, do we find this value\r\nin our busy and haphazard America, but in many quarters the intention\r\nto create it is awake. As for the state, it is, of course, too little\r\ndominated by disinterested intelligence to be beautiful; yet Plato's\r\nideal of statecraft as a fine art still rules the innermost dream of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThe contemplative spirit of art is perhaps more important than the\r\nconstructive in its application to life. Not that any sharp line can\r\nbe drawn between them, for contemplation must always attend or follow\r\ncreation, to judge and enjoy; yet towards that part of life which we\r\ncannot control, our attitude must be rather that of the spectator than\r\nthe creator. We cannot interfere with the greater part of life; we\r\ncan, however, observe it and, in the imagination, transform it, where\r\nwe can then envisage it as we should a work of art. As we watch it,\r\nlife itself may become beautiful, and instead of giving ourselves to\r\nit half-heartedly and with reserve, we shall accept it with something\r\nof the abandon of passionate love,--\"In thee my soul hath her content\r\nso absolute.\" To this end it is necessary to detach life from our more\r\nselfish interests and ambitions, from the habits of thought, annoying\r\nand preoccupying, that relate to self alone. To the worldly and self-\r\ncentered, life is interesting only so far as it refers to pride or\r\nambition or passion; otherwise it is indifferent, as none of their\r\nconcern. But to the religious and to the aesthetically minded, there\r\nis no part of life that may not be of interest; to the former, because\r\nthey impute something of transcendent perfection to it all; to the\r\nlatter, because they have set themselves the inexhaustible task of its\r\nfree, imaginative appreciation.\r\n\r\nTo this end, it is also necessary, after learning to view life\r\nobjectively and impersonally, to attend to it leisurely and\r\nresponsively, as we should to a work of art, allowing full scope to\r\nthe disinterested feelings of curiosity, pity, sympathy, and wonder\r\nto create emotional participation.\r\n\r\nThen the world may become for us the most magnificent spectacle of\r\nall. To imaginative feeling, every landscape is a potential painting,\r\nevery life-story a romance, history a drama, every man or woman a\r\nstatue or portrait. Beauty is everywhere, where we who are perhaps not\r\nartists but only art lovers can find it; we cannot embody it in enduring\r\nform or throw over it the glamour of sensuous loveliness, but we can\r\nperceive it with that free appreciation that is the essence of art.\r\nAnd for this, of course, the artists have prepared us; it is they who,\r\nby first exhibiting life as beautiful in art, have shown us that it\r\nmay be beautiful as mirrored in the observing mind. One region after\r\nanother has been conquered by them. The poets and the painters created\r\nthe beauty of the mountains, of windmills and canals, of frozen wastes\r\nand monotonous prairies, of peasants and factories and railway stations\r\nand slums. Themselves the first to feel the value of these things,\r\nthrough some personal attachment or communion with them, they have\r\nmade it universal through expression. Their works have become types\r\nthrough which we apperceive and appreciate the world: we see French\r\nlandscapes as Lorrain and Corot saw them, peasants after the fashion\r\nof Millet, the stage after Degas. In vain men have prophesied limits\r\nto the victorious advance of art. Just at the time when, in the middle\r\nof the last century, some men feared that science and industry had\r\nbanished beauty from the world, the impressionists and realists\r\ndisclosed it in factory and steamboat and mine. In this way modern\r\nart, which might seem through its isolation to have taken beauty away\r\nfrom the world to itself, has given it back again.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of art, no less than of religion, can help us to triumph\r\nover the evils of life. There are three ways of treating evil\r\nsuccessfully: the practical way, to overcome it and destroy it; the\r\nreligious way, by faith to deny its existence; the aesthetic way, to\r\nrebuild it in the imagination. The first is the way of all strong men;\r\nbut its scope is limited; for some of the evils of life are insuperable;\r\nagainst these our only recourse is faith or the spirit of art. The\r\nmethod of art consists in taking towards life itself the same attitude\r\nthat the artist takes towards his materials when he makes a comedy or\r\na tragedy out of them; life itself becomes the object of laughter or\r\nof tragic pity and fear and admiration. As we observed in our chapter\r\non \"The Problem of Evil in Aesthetics,\" laughter is an essentially\r\naesthetic attitude, for it implies the ability disinterestedly to face\r\na situation, although one which opposes our standards and expectations,\r\nand to take pleasure in it. All sorts of personal feelings may be mixed\r\nwith laughter, bitterness and scorn and anger; but the fact that we\r\nlaugh shows that they are not dominant; in laughter we assert our\r\nfreedom from the yoke of circumstance and make it yield us pleasure\r\neven when it thwarts us. Laughter celebrates a twofold victory, first\r\nover ourselves, in that we do not allow our disappointments to spoil\r\nour serenity, and second over the world, in that, even when it threatens\r\nto render us unhappy, we prevent it. Fate may rob us of everything,\r\nbut not of freedom of spirit and laughter; oftentimes we must either\r\nlaugh or cry, but tears bring only relief, laughter brings merriment\r\nas well.\r\n\r\nEven with the devil laughter may effect reconciliation. Practical men\r\nwill try to destroy him, but so far they have not succeeded; men of\r\nfaith will prophesy his eventual ruin, but meanwhile we have to live\r\nin his company; and how can we live there at peace with ourselves\r\nunless with laughter at his antics and our own vain efforts to restrain\r\nthem? Surely the age-long struggle against him justifies us in making\r\nthis compromise for our happiness. We who in our lifetime cannot defeat\r\nhim can at least make him yield us this meed of laughter for our pains.\r\nPeople who think that laughter at evil is a blasphemy against the good\r\nset too high a valuation upon their conventions. No one can laugh\r\nwithout possessing a standard, but to laugh is to recognize that life\r\nis of more worth than any ideal and happiness better than any morality.\r\n\r\nAnd if by laughter we cannot triumph over evil, we may perhaps achieve\r\nthis end by appreciating it as an element in tragedy or pathos. For\r\nonce we take a contemplative attitude towards life, foregoing praise\r\nand blame, there is no spectacle equal to it for tragic pity and fear\r\nand admiration. There is a heroism in life equal to any in art, in\r\nwhich we may live imaginatively, and in so living forgive the evil\r\nthat is its necessary condition. Or, when life is pathetic rather than\r\ntragic, suffering and fading and weak rather than strong and steady\r\nand resisting, we may win insight from the pitiable reality into the\r\npossible and ideal; the shadow of evil will suggest to us the light\r\nof the good, and for this vision we shall bless life even when it\r\ndisappoints our hopes. The very precariousness of values, which is an\r\ninevitable accompaniment of them, will serve to intensify their worth\r\nfor us; we shall be made the more passionately to love life, with the\r\njoys that it offers us, because we so desperately realize its\r\ntransiency. Our knowledge of the inescapableness of death and failure\r\nwill quiet our laments, leaving us at least serene and resigned where\r\nour struggles and protests would be unavailing. It is by thus\r\ngeneralizing the point of view of art so that we adopt it towards our\r\nown life that we secure the catharsis of tragedy. Instead of letting\r\nsorrow overwhelm us, we may win self-possession through the struggle\r\nagainst it; instead of feeling that there is nothing left when the\r\nloved one dies, we may keep in memory a cherished image, more poignant\r\nand beautiful because the reality is gone, and loving this we shall\r\nlove life also that has provided it.\r\n\r\nFinally, in subtle ways, the influence of art, while remaining indirect,\r\nmay affect practical action in a more concrete fashion. For silently,\r\nunobtrusively, when constantly attended to, a work of art will transform\r\nthe background of values out of which action springs. The beliefs and\r\nsentiments expressed will be accepted not for the moment only,\r\naesthetically and playfully, but for always and practically; they will\r\nbecome a part of our nature. The effect is not merely to enlarge the\r\nscope of our sympathies by making us responsive, as all art does, to\r\nevery human aspiration, but rather to strengthen into resolves those\r\naspirations that meet in us an answering need. This influence is\r\nespecially potent during the early years of life, before the framework\r\nof valuations has become fixed. What young man nursed on Shelley's\r\npoetry has not become a lover of freedom and an active force against\r\nall oppression? But even in maturer years art may work in this way.\r\nOne cannot live constantly with the \"Hermes\" of Praxiteles without\r\nsomething of its serenity entering into one's soul to purge passion\r\nof violence, or with Goethe's poetry without its wisdom making one\r\nwise to live. The effect is not to cause any particular act, but so\r\nto mold the mind that every act performed is different because of this\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nI would compare this influence to that of friends. Friends may, of\r\ncourse, influence conduct directly and immediately through advice and\r\npersuasion, but that is not the most important effect of their lives.\r\nMore important is the gradual diffusion of their attitudes and the\r\nenlightenment following their example. Through living their experiences\r\nwith them, we come to adopt their valuations as our own; by observing\r\nhow they solve their problems, we get suggestions as to how to solve\r\nours. Art provides us with a companionship of the imagination, a new\r\nfriendship. The sympathetic touch with the life there expressed enlarges\r\nour understanding of the problems and conditions of all life, and so\r\nleads to a freer and wiser direction of our own. On the one hand new\r\nand adventurous methods of living are suggested, and on the other hand\r\nthe eternal limits of action are enforced.\r\n\r\nOnce more I would compare the influence of art with that of religion.\r\nThe effect of religion upon conduct is partly due to the institutions\r\nwith which it is connected and the supernatural sanctions which it\r\nattaches to the performance of duty; but partly also, and more\r\nenduringly, to the stories of the gods. Now these stories, even when\r\nbelieved, have an existence in the imagination precisely comparable\r\nto that of works of art, and their influence upon sentiment is of\r\nexactly the same order. They are most effective when beautiful, as the\r\nlegends of Christ and Buddha are beautiful; and they function by the\r\nsympathetic transference of attitude from the story to the believer.\r\nEven when no longer accepted as true their influence may persist, for\r\nthe values they embody lose none of their compulsion. And, although\r\nas an interpretation of life based upon faith religion is doubtless\r\neternal, its specific forms are probably all fictitious; hence each\r\nparticular religion is destined to pass from the sphere of faith to\r\nthat of art. The Greek religion has long since gone there, and there\r\nalso a large part of our own will some day go--what is lost for faith\r\nis retained for beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nGeneral Works\r\n\r\n_English._\r\n\r\nSANTAYANA, G.
