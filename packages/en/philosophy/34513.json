M.

The work I have undertaken will, I trust,\r\ndo something to show how many of the world's worthiest men and women\r\nhave been Freethinkers.\r\n\r\nMy Dictionary does not pretend to be a complete list of those who\r\nhave rendered services to Freethought. To form such a compilation\r\nwould rather be the task of an international society than of an\r\nindividual. Moreover details concerning many worthy workers are now\r\ninaccessible. Freethought boasts its noble army of martyrs of whom\r\nthe world was not worthy, and who paid the penalty of their freedom\r\nin prison or at the stake. Some of the names of these are only known\r\nby the vituperation of their adversaries. I have done my best to\r\npreserve some trustworthy record of as many as possible.\r\n\r\nThe only complete work with a similar design of which I have any\r\nknowledge, is the Dictionnaire des Athées anciens et modernes,\r\nby Sylvain Maréchal with its supplements by Jerome de Lalande the\r\nAstronomer, An. VIII. (1800)-1805. That work, which is now extremely\r\nrare, gave scarcely any biographical details, and unfortunately\r\nfollowed previous orthodox atheographers, such as Buddeus, Reimmann,\r\nHardouin, Garasse, Mersenne, in classing as Atheists those to whom\r\nthe title was inapplicable. I have taken no names from these sources\r\nwithout examining the evidence.\r\n\r\nA work was issued by Richard Carlile in 1826, entitled A Dictionary of\r\nModern Anti-Superstionists; or, \"an account, arranged alphabetically,\r\nof those who, whether called Atheists, Sceptics, Latitudinarians,\r\nReligious Reformers, or etc., have during the last ten centuries\r\ncontributed towards the diminution of superstition. Compiled by\r\na searcher after Truth.\" The compiler, as I have reason to know,\r\nwas Julian Hibbert, who brought to his task adequate scholarship\r\nand leisure. It was, however, conceived on too extensive a scale,\r\nand in 128 pages, all that was issued, it only reached to the name of\r\nAnnet. Julian Hibbert also compiled chronological tables of English\r\nFreethinkers, which were published in the Reasoner for 1855.\r\n\r\nOf the Anti-Trinitarian Biography of the Rev. Robert Wallace, or of\r\nthe previous compilations of Saudius and Bock, I have made but little\r\nuse. To include the names of all who reject some of the Christian\r\ndogmas was quite beside my purpose, though I have included those of\r\nearly Unitarians and Universalists who, I conceive, exhibited the true\r\nspirit of free inquiry in the face of persecution. To the Freydenker\r\nLexikon of J. A. Trinius (1759) my obligations are slight, but should\r\nbe acknowledged. To Bayle's Dictionary, Hoefer's Nouvelle Biographie\r\nGenerale, Meyer's Konversations Lexikon, Franck's Dictionnaire des\r\nSciences Philosophiques, and to Larousse's Grand Dictionnaire Universel\r\nI must also express my indebtedness. In the case of disputed dates\r\nI have usually found Haydn's Dictionary of Biography (1886) most\r\ntrustworthy, but I have also consulted Oettinger's valuable Moniteur\r\ndes Dates.\r\n\r\nThe particulars have in all cases been drawn from the best available\r\nsources. I have not attempted to give a full view of any of the lives\r\ndealt with, but merely sought to give some idea of their services and\r\nrelation to Freethought. Nor have I enumerated the whole of the works\r\nof authors who have often dealt with a variety of subjects. As full\r\na list as is feasible has, however, been given of their distinctive\r\nFreethought works; and the book will, I hope, be useful to anyone\r\nwishing information as to the bibliography of Freethought. The only\r\nwork of a bibliographical kind is the Guide du Libre Penseur, by\r\nM. Alfred Verlière, but his list is very far from complete even of\r\nthe French authors, with whom it is almost entirely occupied. I should\r\nalso mention La Lorgnette Philosophique, by M. Paquet, as giving lively\r\nsketches, though not biographies, of some modern French Freethinkers.\r\n\r\nIn the compilation of my list of names I have received assistance\r\nfrom my friends, Mr. G. W. Foote (to whom I am also indebted for\r\nthe opportunity of publication), Mr. W. J. Birch, Mr. E. Truelove and\r\nMr. F. Malibran. For particulars in regard to some English Freethinkers\r\nI am indebted to Mr. Charles Bradlaugh, Mr. George Jacob Holyoake and\r\nMr. E. T. Craig, while Professor Dalla Volta, of Florence, has kindly\r\nassisted me with some of the Italian names. I must also express my\r\nindebtedness to A. de Gubernatis, whose Dizionario Biografico degli\r\nScrittori Contemporanei I have found of considerable service. My thanks\r\nare also due to G. K. Fortescue, Esq., for permission to examine the\r\ntitles of all Freethought works in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nSome readers may think my list contains names better omitted, while\r\nomitting others well deserving a place. I have, for instance, omitted\r\nmany foreign Liberal Protestants while including Bishop Colenso, who,\r\nostensibly, did not go so far. But my justification, if any, must be\r\nfound in my purpose, which is to record the names of those who have\r\ncontributed in their generation to the advance of Freethought. No one\r\ncan be more conscious of the imperfections of my work than myself,\r\nbut I console myself with the reflection of Plato, that \"though it\r\nbe the merit of a good huntsman to find game in a wide wood, it is\r\nno discredit if he do not find it all\"; and the hope that what I have\r\nattempted some other will complete.\r\n\r\nThe most onerous part of my task has been the examination of the\r\nclaims of some thousand names, mostly foreign, which find no place in\r\nthis dictionary. But the work throughout has been a labor of love. I\r\ndesigned it as my humble contribution to the cause of Freethought, and\r\nleave it with the hope that it will contribute towards the history of\r\n\"the good old cause\"; a history which has yet to be written, and for\r\nwhich, perhaps, the time is not yet ripe.\r\n\r\nShould this volume be received with an encouraging share of favor,\r\nI hope to follow it with a History of Freethought in England, for\r\nwhich I have long been collecting materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA BIOGRAPHICAL DICTIONARY OF FREETHINKERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbælardus (Petrus), b. 1079. A teacher of philosophy at Paris, renowned\r\nfor being loved by the celebrated Eloise. He was accused of teaching\r\nerroneous opinions, chiefly about the Creation and the Trinity, and was\r\ncondemned by a council at Soissons in 1121 and by that of Sens 1140,\r\nat the instigation of St. Bernard. He was hunted about, but spent\r\nhis last days as a monk at Cluni. He died 21 April, 1142. \"Abelard,\"\r\nobserves Hallam, \"was almost the first who awakened mankind, in the\r\nage of darkness, to a sympathy with intellectual excellence.\"\r\n\r\nAbano (Petrus de). See Petrus, de Abano.\r\n\r\nAbauzit (Firmin), a French writer, descended from an Arabian family\r\nwhich settled in the South of France early in the ninth century,\r\nb. Uzes, 11 Nov. 1679. He travelled in Holland and became acquainted\r\nwith Bayle, attained a reputation for philosophy, and was consulted by\r\nVoltaire and Rousseau. Among his works are, Reflections on the Gospels,\r\nand an essay on the Apocalypse, in which he questions the authority\r\nof that work. Died at Geneva 20 March, 1767. His Miscellanies were\r\ntranslated in English by E. Harwood, 1774.\r\n\r\nAbbot (Francis Ellingwood). American Freethinker, b. Boston, 6\r\nNov. 1836. He graduated at Harvard University 1859, began life as a\r\nUnitarian minister, but becoming too broad for that Church, resigned\r\nin 1869. He started the Index, a journal of free religious inquiry\r\nand anti-supernaturalism, at Toledo, but since 1874 at Boston. This he\r\nedited 1870-80. In 1872 appeared his Impeachment of Christianity. In\r\naddition to his work on the Index, Mr. Abbot has lectured a great\r\ndeal, and has contributed to the North American Review and other\r\nperiodicals. He was the first president of the American National\r\nLiberal League. Mr. Abbot is an evolutionist and Theist, and defends\r\nhis views in Scientific Theism, 1886.\r\n\r\nAblaing van Giessenburg (R.C.) See Giessenburg.\r\n\r\nAbu Bakr Ibn Al-Tufail (Abu J'afar) Al Isbili. Spanish Arabian\r\nphilosopher, b. at Guadys, wrote a philosophical romance of pantheistic\r\ntendency Hai Ibn Yakdan, translated into Latin by Pocock, Oxford 1671,\r\nand into English by S. Ockley, 1711, under the title of The Improvement\r\nof Human Reason. Died at Morocco 1185.\r\n\r\nAbu-Fazil (Abu al Fadhl ibn Mubarak, called Al Hindi), vizier to\r\nthe great Emperor Akbar from 1572. Although by birth a Muhammadan,\r\nhis investigations into the religions of India made him see equal\r\nworth in all, and, like his master, Akbar, he was tolerant of all\r\nsects. His chief work is the Ayin Akbary, a statistical account of\r\nthe Indian Empire. It was translated by F. Gladwin, 1777. He was\r\nassassinated 1604.\r\n\r\nAbul-Abbas-Abdallah III. (Al Mamoun), the seventh Abbasside, caliph,\r\nson of Haroun al Rashid, was b. at Bagdad 16 Sept. 786. He was a patron\r\nof science and literature, collected Greek and Hebrew manuscripts,\r\nand invited the scholars of all nations to his capital. He wrote\r\nseveral treatises and poems. Died in war near Tarsus, 9 Aug. 833.\r\n\r\nAbul-Ola (Ahmad ibn Abd Allah ibn Sulaiman), celebrated Arabian poet,\r\nb. at Maari, in Syria, Dec., 973. His free opinions gave much scandal\r\nto devout Moslems. He was blind through small-pox from the age of\r\nfour years, but his poems exhibit much knowledge. He called himself\r\n\"the doubly imprisoned captive,\" in allusion to his seclusion and\r\nloss of sight. He took no pains to conceal that he believed in no\r\nrevealed religion. Died May, 1057, and ordered the following verse\r\nto be written on his tomb:--\"I owe this to the fault of my father:\r\nnone owe the like to mine.\"\r\n\r\nAbu Tahir (al Karmatti), the chief of a freethinking sect at Bahrein,\r\non the Persian Gulf, who with a comparatively small number of followers\r\ncaptured Mecca (930), and took away the black stone. He suddenly\r\nattacked, defeated, and took prisoner Abissaj whom, at the head of\r\nthirty thousand men, the caliph had sent against him. Died in 943.\r\n\r\nAchillini (Alessandro), Italian physician and philosopher b. Bologna 29\r\nOct. 1463. He expounded the doctrines of Averroes, and wrote largely\r\nupon anatomy. Died 2 Aug. 1512. His collected works were published\r\nat Venice, 1545.\r\n\r\nAckermann (Louise-Victorine, née Choquet), French poetess, b. Paris 30\r\nNov. 1813. She travelled to Germany and there married (1853) a young\r\ntheologian, Paul Ackerman, who in preparing for the ministry lost his\r\nChristian faith, and who, after becoming teacher to Prince Frederick\r\nWilliam (afterwards Frederick III.), died at the age of thirty-four\r\n(1846). Both were friends of Proudhon. Madame Ackermann's poems\r\n(Paris 1863-74 and 85) exhibit her as a philosophic pessimist and\r\nAtheist. \"God is dethroned,\" says M. Caro of her poems (Revue des\r\nDeux Mondes, 15 May, 1874). She professes hatred of Christianity\r\nand its interested professors. She has also published Thoughts of a\r\nSolitary. Sainte Beuve calls her \"the learned solitary of Nice.\"\r\n\r\nAcollas (Pierre Antoine René Paul Emile), French jurisconsult and\r\npolitical writer, b. La Châtre 25 June, 1826, studied law at Paris. For\r\nparticipating in the Geneva congress of the International Society\r\nin 1867 he was condemned to one year's imprisonment. In 1871 he was\r\nappointed head of the law faculty by the Commune. He has published\r\nseveral manuals popularising the legal rights of the people, and has\r\nwritten on Marriage its Past, Present, and Future, 1880. Mrs. Besant\r\nhas translated his monograph on The Idea of God in the Revolution,\r\npublished in the Droits de l'Homme.\r\n\r\nAcontius (Jacobus--Italian, Giacomo Aconzio). Born at Trent early\r\nin sixteenth century. After receiving ordination in the Church of\r\nRome he relinquished that faith and fled to Switzerland in 1557. He\r\nsubsequently came to England and served Queen Elizabeth as a military\r\nengineer. To her he dedicated his Strategems of Satan, published at\r\nBasle 1565. This was one of the earliest latitudinarian works, and\r\nwas placed upon the Index. It was also bitterly assailed by Protestant\r\ndivines, both in England and on the Continent. An English translation\r\nappeared in 1648. Some proceedings were taken against Acontius before\r\nBishop Grindall, of the result of which no account is given. Some\r\npassages of Milton's Areopagitica may be traced to Acontius, who,\r\nCheynell informs us, lived till 1623. Stephen's Dictionary of National\r\nBiography says he is believed to have died shortly after 1566.\r\n\r\nAcosta (Uriel). Born at Oporto 1597, the son of a Christianised Jew;\r\nhe was brought up as a Christian, but on reaching maturity, rejected\r\nthat faith. He went to Holland, where he published a work equally\r\ncriticising Moses and Jesus. For this he was excommunicated by the\r\nSynagogue, fined and put in prison by the Amsterdam authorities,\r\nand his work suppressed. After suffering many indignities from both\r\nJews and Christians, he committed suicide 1647.\r\n\r\nAdams (George), of Bristol, sentenced in 1842 to one month's\r\nimprisonment for selling the Oracle of Reason.\r\n\r\nAdams (Robert C.), Canadian Freethought writer and lecturer.

He graduated at Columbia\r\nCollege, 1870, was professor of Hebrew and Oriental literature\r\nat Cornell University from '74 to May '76, when he established in\r\nNew York the Society of Ethical Culture, to which he discourses on\r\nSundays. In 1877 he published a volume entitled Creed and Deed, in\r\nwhich he rejects supernatural religion. Dr. Adler has also contributed\r\nmany papers to the Radical literature of America.\r\n\r\nÆnesidemus. A Cretan sceptical philosopher of the first century. He\r\nadopted the principle of Heraclitus, that all things were in course\r\nof change, and argued against our knowledge of ultimate causes.\r\n\r\nAiry (Sir George Biddell). English Astronomer Royal, b. Alnwick\r\n27 July, 1801. Educated at Cambridge, where he became senior\r\nwrangler 1823. During a long life Professor Airy did much to advance\r\nastronomical science. His Notes on the Earlier Hebrew Scriptures 1876,\r\nproves him to have been a thorough-going Freethinker.\r\n\r\nAitkenhead (Thomas), an Edinburgh student aged eighteen, who was\r\nindicted for blasphemy, by order of the Privy Council, for having\r\ncalled the Old Testament \"Ezra's Fables,\" and having maintained\r\nthat God and nature were the same. He was found guilty 24 Dec. 1696,\r\nand hanged for blasphemy, 8 Jan. 1697.\r\n\r\nAitzema (Lieuwe van), a nobleman of Friesland, b. at Dorckum 19\r\nNov. 1600, author of a suppressed History of the Netherlands, between\r\n1621-68.

Died at the Hague 23\r\nFeb. 1669.\r\n\r\nAkbar (Jalal-ed-din Muhammad), the greatest of the emperors of\r\nHindostan, b. 15 Oct. 1542, was famous for his wide administration and\r\nimprovement of the empire. Akbar showed toleration alike to Christians,\r\nMuhammadans, and to all forms of the Hindu faith. He had the Christian\r\ngospels and several Brahmanical treatises translated into Persian. The\r\nresult of his many conferences on religion between learned men of\r\nall sects, are collected in the Dabistan. Akbar was brought up as a\r\nMuhammadan, but became a Theist, acknowledging one God, but rejecting\r\nall other dogmas. Died Sept. 1605.\r\n\r\nAlberger (John). American author of Monks, Popes, and their Political\r\nIntrigues (Baltimore, 1871) and Antiquity of Christianity (New York,\r\n1874).\r\n\r\nAlbini (Giuseppe). Italian physiologist, b. Milan.

Yakub ibn Is'hak ibn Subbah (Abú Yúsuf) called Al Kindi,\r\nArab physician and philosopher, the great grandson of one of the\r\ncompanions of Muhammad, the prophet, flourished from 814 to about\r\n840. He was a rationalist in religion, and for his scientific studies\r\nhe was set down as a magician.\r\n\r\nAlciati (Giovanni Paolo). A Milanese of noble family. At first\r\na Romanist, he resigned that faith for Calvinism, but gradually\r\nadvanced to Anti-trinitarianism, which he defends in two letters\r\nto Gregorio Pauli, dated Austerlitz 1564 and 1565. Beza says that\r\nAlciati deserted the Christian faith and became a Muhammadan, but\r\nBayle takes pains to disprove this. Died at Dantzic about 1570.\r\n\r\nAleardi (Gaetano). Italian poet, known as Aleardo Aleardi, b. Verona, 4\r\nNov. 1812. He was engaged in a life-long struggle against the Austrian\r\ndominion, and his patriotic poems were much admired. In 1859 he was\r\nelected deputy to Parliament for Brescia. Died Verona, 16 July, 1878.\r\n\r\nAlembert (Jean le Rond d'), mathematician and philosopher, b. at\r\nParis 16 Nov. 1717. He was an illegitimate son of Canon Destouches\r\nand Mme. Tencin, and received his Christian name from a church\r\nnear which he was exposed as a foundling. He afterwards resided\r\nfor forty years with his nurse, nor would he leave her for the most\r\ntempting offers. In 1741, he was admitted a member of the Academy of\r\nSciences. In 1749, he obtained the prize medal from the Academy of\r\nBerlin, for a discourse on the theory of winds. In 1749, he solved the\r\nproblem of the procession of the equinoxes and explained the mutation\r\nof the earth's axis. He next engaged with Diderot, with whose opinions\r\nhe was in complete accord, in compiling the famous Encyclopédie, for\r\nwhich he wrote the preliminary discourse. In addition to this great\r\nwork he published many historical, philosophical and scientific essays,\r\nand largely corresponded with Voltaire. His work on the Destruction\r\nof the Jesuits is a caustic and far-reaching production. In a letter\r\nto Frederick the Great, he says: \"As for the existence of a supreme\r\nintelligence, I think that those who deny it advance more than they\r\ncan prove, and scepticism is the only reasonable course.\" He goes on\r\nto say, however, that experience invincibly proves the materiality of\r\nthe \"soul.\" Died 29 Oct. 1783. In 1799 two volumes of his posthumous\r\nessays were printed in Paris. His works prove d'Alembert to have been\r\nof broad spirit and of most extensive knowledge.\r\n\r\nAlfieri (Vittorio), Count. Famous Italian poet and dramatist, b. Asti,\r\nPiedmont, 17 Jan. 1749, of a noble family. His tragedies are justly\r\ncelebrated, and in his Essay on Tyranny he shows himself as favorable\r\nto religious as to political liberty. Written in his youth, this work\r\nwas revised at a more advanced age, the author remarking that if he\r\nhad no longer the courage, or rather the fire, necessary to compose\r\nit, he nevertheless retained intelligence, independence and judgment\r\nenough to approve it, and to let it stand as the last of his literary\r\nproductions. His attack is chiefly directed against Catholicism,\r\nbut he does not spare Christianity. \"Born among a people,\" he says,\r\n\"slavish, ignorant, and already entirely subjugated by priests, the\r\nChristian religion knows only how to enjoin the blindest obedience,\r\nand is unacquainted even with the name of liberty.\" Alfieri's tragedy\r\nof Saul has been prohibited on the English stage. Died Florence,\r\n8 Oct. 1803.\r\n\r\nAlfonso X., surnamed the Wise, King of Castillo and of Leon; b. in\r\n1223, crowned 1252. A patron of science and lover of astronomy. He\r\ncompiled a complete digest of Roman, feudal and canon law, and\r\nhad drawn up the astronomical tables called Alfonsine Tables. By\r\nhis liberality and example he gave a great impulse to Spanish\r\nliterature. For his intercourse with Jews and Arabians, his\r\nindependence towards the Pope and his free disposal of the clerical\r\nrevenues, he has been stigmatised as an Atheist. To him is attributed\r\nthe well-known remark that had he been present at the creation of the\r\nworld he would have proposed some improvements. Father Lenfant adds\r\nthe pious lie that \"The king had scarcely pronounced this blasphemy\r\nwhen a thunderbolt fell and reduced his wife and two children to\r\nashes.\" Alfonso X. died 4 April, 1284.\r\n\r\nAlgarotti (Francesco), Count. Italian writer and art critic, b. at\r\nVenice, 11 Dec. 1712. A visit to England led him to write Newtonianism\r\nfor the Ladies. He afterwards visited Berlin and became the friend\r\nboth of Voltaire and of Frederick the Great, who appointed him his\r\nChamberlain. Died with philosophical composure at Pisa, 3 May, 1764.\r\n\r\nAlger (William Rounseville), b. at Freetown, Massachusetts, 30\r\nDec. 1822, educated at Harvard, became a Unitarian preacher of the\r\nadvanced type. His Critical History of the Doctrine of a Future\r\nLife, with a complete bibliography of the subject by Ezra Abbot,\r\nis a standard work, written from the Universalist point of view.\r\n\r\nAllen (Charles Grant Blairfindie), naturalist and author, b. in\r\nKingston, Canada, 24 Feb. 1848. He studied at Merton College, Oxford,\r\nand graduated with honors 1871. In 1873 appointed Professor of Logic\r\nin Queen's College, Spanish town, Jamaica; from 1874 to '77 he was\r\nits principal. Since then he has resided in England, and become\r\nknown by his popular expositions of Darwinism. His published works\r\ninclude Physiological Æsthetics (1877), The Evolutionist at Large\r\n(1881), Nature Studies (1883), Charles Darwin (1885), and several\r\nnovels. Grant Allen has also edited the miscellaneous works of Buckle,\r\nand has written on Force and Energy (1888).\r\n\r\nAllen (Ethan) Col., American soldier, b. at Litchfield, Connecticut,\r\n10 Jan. 1737. One of the most active of the revolutionary heroes,\r\nhe raised a company of volunteers known as the \"Green Mountain Boys,\"\r\nand took by surprise the British fortress of Ticonderoga, capturing\r\n100 guns, 10 May, 1775. He was declared an outlaw and £100 offered\r\nfor his arrest by Gov. Tryon of New York. Afterwards he was taken\r\nprisoner and sent to England. At first treated with cruelty, he was\r\neventually exchanged for another officer, 6 May, 1778. He was a member\r\nof the state legislature, and succeeded in obtaining the recognition\r\nof Vermont as an independent state. He published in 1784 Reason\r\nthe only Oracle of Man, the first publication in the United States\r\nopenly directed against the Christian religion. It has been frequently\r\nreprinted and is still popular in America. Died Burlington, Vermont,\r\n13 Feb. 1789. A statue is erected to him at Montpelier, Vermont.\r\n\r\nAllsop (Thomas). \"The favorite disciple of Coleridge,\" b. 10 April,\r\n1794, near Wirksworth, Derbyshire, he lived till 1880. A friend\r\nof Robert Owen and the Chartists. He was implicated in the attempt\r\nof Orsini against Napoleon III. In his Letters, Conversations and\r\nRecollections of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, he has imported many of\r\nhis Freethought views.\r\n\r\nAlm (Richard von der). See Ghillany (F. W.)\r\n\r\nAlpharabius (Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn Tarkhan) (Abu Nasr), called\r\nAl Farabi, Turkish philosopher, termed by Ibn Khallikan the greatest\r\nphilosopher the Moslems ever had, travelled to Bagdad, mastered\r\nthe works of Aristotle, and became master of Avicenna. Al Farabi is\r\nsaid to have taught the eternity of the world and to have denied the\r\npermanent individuality of the soul. His principal work is a sort\r\nof encyclopædia. Rénan says he expressly rejected all supernatural\r\nrevelation. Died at Damascus Dec. 950, aged upwards of eighty.\r\n\r\nAmaury or Amalric de Chartres, a heretic of the thirteenth century,\r\nwas a native of Bene, near Chartres, and lived at Paris, where he gave\r\nlessons in logic. In a work bearing the title of Physion, condemned\r\nby a bull of Pope Innocent III. (1204), he is said to have taught a\r\nkind of Pantheism, and that the reign of the Father and Son must give\r\nplace to that of the Holy Spirit.

He,\r\nhowever, turned Pagan and opened a school of philosophy. Among his\r\npupils were Origen, Longinus and Plotinus. He undoubtedly originated\r\nthe Neo-Platonic movement, which formed the most serious opposition\r\nto Christianity in its early career. Ammonius died A.D. 243, aged\r\nover eighty years.\r\n\r\nAnaxagoras, a Greek philosopher of the Ionic school, b. about 499 B.C.,\r\nlived at Athens and enjoyed the friendship of Pericles.

He took part in the Freethought Congress at Naples in 1869,\r\nand in June of the following year he was imprisoned for three months\r\nfor his attack on the Empire. On the establishment of the Republic he\r\nwas nominated procureur at Lyons. He was on the municipal council of\r\nthat city, which he has also represented in the Chamber of Deputies.

One of the most forcible writers among the English\r\nDeists, b. at Liverpool in 1693. He was at one time a schoolmaster\r\nand invented a system of shorthand. Priestley learnt it at school\r\nand corresponded with Annet. In 1739 he published a pamphlet on\r\nFreethinking the Great Duty of Religion, by P. A., minister of\r\nreligion. This was followed by the Conception of Jesus as the\r\nFoundation of the Christian Religion, in which he boldly attacks\r\nthe doctrine of the Incarnation as \"a legend of the Romanists,\"\r\nand The Resurrection of Jesus Considered (1744) in answer to Bishop\r\nSherlock's Trial of the Witnesses. This controversy was continued in\r\nThe Resurrection Reconsidered and The Resurrection Defenders Stript\r\nof all Defence. In An Examination of the History and Character of\r\nSt. Paul he attacks the sincerity of the apostle to the Gentiles and\r\neven questions the authenticity of his epistles. In Supernaturals\r\nExamined (1747) he argues that all miracles are incredible. In 1761\r\nhe issued nine numbers of the Free Inquirer, in which he attacked\r\nthe authenticity and credibility of the Pentateuch.

The History of the Man\r\nafter God's Own Heart (1761) ascribed to Annet, was more probably\r\nwritten by Archibald Campbell. The View of the Life of King David\r\n(1765) by W. Skilton, Horologist, is also falsely attributed to Annet.\r\n\r\nAnthero de Quental, Portuguese writer, b. San Miguel 1843.

Deutsch\r\nwith the author of the Targum of Onkelos.\r\n\r\nArago (Dominique François Jean), French academician, politician,\r\nphysicist and astronomer, b. Estagel, 26 Feb. 1786.

He\r\nwrote fifty-four plays, of which only eleven remain, and was crowned\r\nin a public assembly for his attacks on the oligarchs. With the utmost\r\nboldness he satirised not only the the political and social evils\r\nof the age, but also the philosophers, the gods, and the theology\r\nof the period. Plato is said to have died with Aristophanes' works\r\nunder his pillow. Died about 380 B.C.\r\n\r\nAristotle, the most illustrious of ancient philosophers, was born at\r\nStagyra, in Thrace, 384 B.C. He was employed by Philip of Macedon\r\nto instruct his son Alexander. His inculcation of ethics as apart\r\nfrom all theology, justifies his place in this list. After the death\r\nof Alexander, he was accused of impiety and withdrew to Chalcis,\r\nwhere he died B.C. 322. Grote says: \"In the published writings of\r\nAristotle the accusers found various heretical doctrines suitable for\r\nsustaining their indictment; as, for example, the declaration that\r\nprayer and sacrifices to the gods were of no avail.\" His influence\r\nwas predominant upon philosophy for nearly two thousand years. Dante\r\nspeaks of him as \"the master of those that know.\"\r\n\r\nArnold of Brescia, a pupil of Abelard.

In 1857 he was elected Professor of Poetry at Oxford. In\r\n1871 he published an essay entitled St. Paul and Protestantism; in 1873\r\nLiterature and Dogma, which, from its rejection of supernaturalism,\r\noccasioned much stir and was followed by God and the Bible. In 1877\r\nMr. Arnold published Last Essays on Church and State. Mr. Arnold\r\nhas a lucid style and is abreast of the thought of his age, but he\r\ncuriously unites rejection of supernaturalism, including a personal\r\nGod, with a fond regard for the Church of England. He may be said\r\nin his own words to wander \"between two worlds, one dead, the other\r\npowerless to be born.\" Died 15 April, 1888.\r\n\r\nArnould (Arthur), French writer, b. Dieuze 7 April, 1833.

On the death of his uncle Antoninus Pius, 161, the\r\nSenate obliged him to take the government, but he associated with\r\nhimself L. Verus. On the death of Verus in 169 Antoninus possessed\r\nsole authority, which he exercised with wise discretion and great\r\nglory. Much of his time was employed in defending the northern\r\nfrontiers of the empire against Teutonic barbarians. He had no\r\nhigh opinion of Christians, speaking of their obstinacy, and it is\r\npretended many were put to death in the reign of one of the best\r\nemperors that ever ruled. If so we may be assured it was for their\r\ncrimes. Ecclesiastical historians have invented another pious miracle\r\nin a victory gained through the prayers of the Christians. Antoninus\r\nheld that duty was indispensable even were there no gods. His\r\nMeditations, written in the midst of a most active life, breathe a\r\nlofty morality, and are a standing refutation of the view that pure\r\nethics depend upon Christian belief. Died 17 March, 180.\r\n\r\nAustin (Charles), lawyer and disciple of Bentham, b. Suffolk 1799. At\r\nCambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1824 and M.A. in 1827, he won,\r\nmuch to the amazement of his friends, who knew his heterodox opinions,\r\nthe Hulsean prize for an essay on Christian evidences. For this he\r\nwas sorry afterwards, and told Lord Stanley of Alderley \"I could\r\nhave written a much better essay on the other side.\" He afterwards\r\nwrote on the other side in the Westminster Review. Successful as a\r\nlawyer, he retired in ill-health. J. S. Mill writes highly of his\r\ninfluence. The Hon. L. A. Tollemache gives a full account of his\r\nheretical opinions. He says \"He inclined to Darwinism, because as he\r\nsaid, it is so antecedently probable; but, long before this theory\r\nbroke the back of final causes, he himself had given them up.\" Died\r\n21 Dec. 1874.\r\n\r\nAustin (John), jurist, brother of above, was born 3 March, 1790.

Al-Fath Ibn Khâkân represents him as an infidel and\r\nAtheist, and says: \"Faith disappeared from his heart and left not a\r\ntrace behind; his tongue forgot the Merciful, neither did [the holy]\r\nname cross his lips.\" He is said to have suffered imprisonment for\r\nhis heterodoxy.\r\n\r\nAvenel (Georges), French writer, b. at Chaumont 31 Dec. 1828.

He translated and commented upon the works of Aristotle,\r\nand resolutely placed the claims of science above those of theology. He\r\nwas prosecuted for his heretical opinions by the Muhammadan doctors,\r\nwas spat upon by all who entered the mosque at the hour of prayer,\r\nand afterwards banished. His philosophical opinions, which incline\r\ntowards materialism and pantheism, had the honor of being condemned\r\nby the University of Paris in 1240. They were opposed by St. Thomas\r\nAquinas, and when profoundly influencing Europe at the Renaissance\r\nthrough the Paduan school were again condemned by Pope Leo X. in 1513.\r\n\r\nAvicenna (Husain Ibn Abdallah, called Ibn Sina), Arabian physician and\r\nphilosopher, b.

He then proceeded\r\nto a Review of the Gospel History, upon the publication of which\r\n(1840) he was deprived of his professorship at Bonn. To this followed\r\nChristianity Unveiled (1843), which was destroyed at Zurich before\r\nits publication. This work continued his opposition to religion,\r\nwhich was carried still further in ironical style in his Proclamation\r\nof the Day of Judgement concerning Hegel the Atheist.

In his journal Nouvelles de la République des Lettres\r\nhe advocates religious toleration on the ground of the difficulty of\r\ndistinguishing truth from error. His criticism of Maimbourg's History\r\nof Calvinism was ordered to be burnt by the hangman. Jurieu persecuted\r\nhim, and he was ordered to be more careful in preparing the second\r\nedition of his dictionary. He died at Rotterdam, 28 Dec. 1706.

It was in evidence that the Pope had said\r\n\"God may do the worst with me that he pleases in the future life; I\r\nbelieve as every educated man does, the vulgar believe otherwise.

Boyle gave no name, and was indicted and tried as\r\n\"a man with name unknown\" for publishing a blasphemous and seditious\r\nlibel. In his defence he ably asserted his right to hold and publish\r\nhis opinions. He read portions of the Bible in court to prove he was\r\njustified in calling it obscene.

In '68 he began his efforts to enter Parliament,\r\nand in 1880 was returned for Northampton. After a long struggle\r\nwith the House, which would not admit the Atheist, he at length took\r\nhis seat in 1885. He was four times re-elected, and the litigation\r\ninto which he was plunged will become as historic as that of John\r\nWilkes. Prosecuted in '76 for publishing The Fruits of Philosophy, he\r\nsucceeded in quashing the indictment. Mr. Bradlaugh has had numerous\r\ndebates, several of which are published. He has also written many\r\npamphlets, of which we mention New Lives of Abraham, David, and\r\nother saints, Who was Jesus Christ? What did Jesus Teach?

Hennell,\r\nand took the System of Nature and Volney's Ruins of Empires \"to\r\nenliven the honeymoon.\" Among his friends was Mary Ann Evans (\"George\r\nEliot\"), who accompanied Mr. and Mrs. Bray to Italy. His works on\r\nThe Philosophy of Necessity (1841) and Cerebral Psychology (1875)\r\ngive the key to all his thought.

His treatise Religio Medici, famous for its fine\r\nstyle and curious mixture of faith and scepticism, was surreptitiously\r\npublished in 1642. It ran through several editions and was placed on\r\nthe Roman Index. His Pseudodoxia Epidemica; Enquiries into Vulgar\r\nand Common Errors, appeared in 1646. While disputing many popular\r\nsuperstitions he showed he partook of others. This curious work\r\nwas followed by Hydriotaphia, or Urn-Burial, in which he treats\r\nof cremation among the ancients. To this was added The Garden of\r\nCyrus. He died 19 Oct. 1682.\r\n\r\nBruno (Giordano), Freethought martyr, b. at Nola, near Naples, about\r\n1548. He was christened Filippo which he changed to Filoteo, taking\r\nthe name of Giordano when he entered the Dominican order. Religious\r\ndoubts and bold strictures on the monks obliged him to quit Italy,\r\nprobably in 1580. He went to Geneva but soon found it no safe abiding\r\nplace, and quitted it for Paris, where he taught, but refused to attend\r\nmass. In 1583 he visited England, living with the French ambassador\r\nCastelnau.

Bruno was vastly before his age\r\nin his conception of the universe and his rejection of theological\r\ndogmas. A statue of this heroic apostle of liberty and light, executed\r\nby one of the first sculptors of Italy, is to be erected on the spot\r\nwhere he perished, the Municipal Council of Rome having granted the\r\nsite in face of the bitterest opposition of the Catholic party. The\r\nlist of subscribers to this memorial comprises the principal advanced\r\nthinkers in Europe and America.\r\n\r\nBrzesky (Casimir Liszynsky Podsedek). See Liszinski.\r\n\r\nBucali or Busali (Leonardo), a Calabrian abbot of Spanish descent,\r\nwho became a follower of Servetus in the sixteenth century, and had\r\nto seek among the Turks the safety denied him in Christendom. He died\r\nat Damascus.\r\n\r\nBuchanan (George), Scotch historian and scholar, b. Killearn,\r\nFeb. 1506. Evincing an early love of study, he was sent to\r\nParis at the age of fourteen. He returned to Scotland and became\r\ndistinguished for his learning. James V. appointed him tutor to his\r\nnatural son. He composed his Franciscanus et Fratres, a satire on the\r\nmonks, which hastened the Scottish reformation. This exposed him to\r\nthe vengeance of the clergy. Not content with calling him Atheist,\r\nArchbishop Beaton had him arrested and confined in St. Andrew's\r\nCastle, from whence he escaped and fled to England. Here he found,\r\nas he said, Henry VIII. burning men of opposite opinions at the same\r\nstake for religion. He returned to Paris, but was again subjected to\r\nthe persecution of Beaton, the Scottish Ambassador. On the death of\r\na patron at Bordeaux, in 1548, he was seized by the Inquisition and\r\nimmured for a year and a half in a monastery, where he translated\r\nthe Psalms into Latin. He eventually returned to Scotland, where he\r\nespoused the party of Moray. After a most active life, he died 28\r\nSept. 1582, leaving a History of Scotland, besides numerous poems,\r\nsatires, and political writings, the most important of which is a\r\nwork of republican tendency, De Jure Regni, the Rights of Kings.\r\n\r\nBuchanan (Robert), Socialist, b. Ayr, 1813. He was successively a\r\nschoolmaster, a Socialist missionary and a journalist.

An Exposure\r\nof Joseph Barker, and a Concise History of Modern Priestcraft also\r\nbear the latter date. At this time the Socialists were prosecuted for\r\nlecturing on Sunday, and Buchanan was fined for refusing to take the\r\noath of supremacy, etc. After the decline of Owenism, he wrote for\r\nthe Northern Star, and edited the Glasgow Sentinel. He died at the\r\nhome of his son, the poet, at Bexhill, Sussex, 4 March, 1866.\r\n\r\nBuchanan (Joseph Rhodes), American physician, b. Frankfort, Kentucky,\r\n11 Dec. 1814.

See Buechner.\r\n\r\nBuckle (Henry Thomas), philosophical historian, b. Lee, Kent, 24\r\nNov. 1821. In consequence of his delicate health he was educated at\r\nhome. His mother was a strict Calvinist, his father a strong Tory,\r\nbut a visit to the Continent made him a Freethinker and Radical. He\r\never afterwards held travelling to be the best education. It was his\r\nambition to write a History of Civilisation in England, but so vast was\r\nhis design that his three notable volumes with that title form only\r\npart of the introduction. The first appeared in 1858, and created a\r\ngreat sensation by its boldness. In the following year he championed\r\nthe cause of Pooley, who was condemned for blasphemy, and dared the\r\nprosecution of infidels of standing. In 1861 he visited the East,\r\nin the hope of improving his health, but died at Damascus, 29 May,\r\n1862. Much of the material collected for his History has been published\r\nin his Miscellaneous and Posthumous Works, edited by Helen Taylor,\r\n1872. An abridged edition, edited by Grant Allen, appeared in 1886.\r\n\r\nBuechner (Friedrich Karl Christian Ludwig), German materialist,\r\nb. Darmstadt, 29 March, 1824. Studied medicine in Geissen, Strassburg\r\nand Vienna. In '55 he startled the world with his bold work on\r\nForce and Matter, which has gone through numerous editions and been\r\ntranslated into nearly all the European languages. This work lost\r\nhim the place of professor which he held at Tübingen, and he has\r\nsince practised in his native town. Büchner has developed his ideas\r\nin many other works such as Nature and Spirit (1857), Physiological\r\nSketches, '61; Nature and Science, '62; Conferences on Darwinism,\r\n'69; Man in the Past, Present and Future, '69; Materialism its History\r\nand Influence on Society, '73; The Idea of God, '74; Mind in Animals,\r\n'80; and Light and Life, '82.

An incessant worker. His Natural\r\nHistory in 36 volumes bears witness to the fertility of his mind\r\nand his capacity for making science attractive. Buffon lived much in\r\nseclusion, and attached himself to no sect or religion. Some of his\r\nsentences were attacked by the Sorbonne. Hérault de Sêchelles says\r\nthat Buffon said: \"I have named the Creator, but it is only necessary\r\nto take out the word and substitute the power of nature.\" Died at\r\nParis 16 April, 1788.\r\n\r\nBuitendijk or Buytendyck (Gosuinus van), Dutch Spinozist, who wrote an\r\nApology at the beginning of the eighteenth century and was banished\r\n1716.\r\n\r\nBufalini (Maurizio), Italian doctor, b. Cesena 2 June, 1787. In 1813 he\r\npublished an essay on the Doctrine of Life in opposition to vitalism,\r\nand henceforward his life was a conflict with the upholders of that\r\ndoctrine. He was accused of materialism, but became a professor at\r\nFlorence and a member of the Italian Senate in 1860. Died at Florence\r\n31 March, 1875.\r\n\r\nBurdach (Karl Friedrich), German physiologist, b. Leipsic 12 June,\r\n1776. He occupied a chair at the University of Breslau. His works on\r\nphysiology and anthropology did much to popularise those sciences,\r\nand the former is placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum for its\r\nmaterialistic tendency. He died at Konigsberg, 16 July, 1847.\r\n\r\nBurdon (William), M.A., writer, b. Newcastle, 11 Sept. 1764. Graduated\r\nat Emmanuel College, Cambridge, 1788. He was intended for a clergyman,\r\nbut want of faith made him decline that profession. His principal work\r\nis entitled Materials for Thinking. Colton largely availed himself of\r\nthis work in his Lacon. It went through five editions in his lifetime,\r\nand portions were reprinted in the Library of Reason. He also addressed\r\nThree Letters to the Bishop of Llandaff, wrote a Life and Character of\r\nBonaparte, translated an account of the Revolution in Spain, edited the\r\nMemoirs of Count Boruwlaski, and wrote some objections to the annual\r\nsubscription to the Sons of the Clergy.

He became\r\na member of the French Academy, wrote a treatise on the Authority\r\nof the Pope, a History of Pagan Philosophy and other works, and\r\nis credited with the Critical Examination of the Apologists of the\r\nChristian Religion, published under the name of Freret by Naigeon,\r\n1766. Levesque de Burigny wrote a letter in answer to Bergier's\r\nProofs of Christianity, which is published in Naigeon's Recueil\r\nPhilosophique. Died at Paris, 8 Oct. 1785.\r\n\r\nBurmeister (Hermann), German naturalist, b. Stralsund, 15 Jan. 1807. In\r\n1827 he became a doctor at Halle. In '48 he was elected to the National\r\nAssembly.

Through the\r\ninterest of a pupil, the Duke of Ormonde, he obtained the mastership\r\nof the Charterhouse, 1685. In 1681 the first part of his Telluris\r\nTheoria Sacra, or Sacred Theory of the Earth, appeared in Latin, and\r\nwas translated and modified in 1684. In 1692 Burnet published, both\r\nin English and in Latin, his Archæologiæ Philosophicæ, or the Ancient\r\nDoctrine of the Origin of Things. He professes in this to reconcile\r\nhis theory with Genesis, which receives a figurative interpretation;\r\nand a ludicrous dialogue between Eve and the serpent gave great\r\noffence. In a popular ballad Burnet is represented as saying--\r\n\r\n\r\n                That all the books of Moses\r\n                Were nothing but supposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had to resign a position at court. In later life he wrote De Fide\r\net Officiis Christianorum (on Christian Faith and Duties), in which\r\nhe regards historical religions as based on the religion of nature,\r\nand rejects original sin and the \"magical\" theory of sacraments;\r\nand De Statu Mortuorum et Resurgentium, on the State of the Dead and\r\nResurrected, in which he opposed the doctrine of eternal punishment\r\nand shadowed forth a scheme of Deism. These books he kept to himself\r\nto avoid a prosecution for heresy, but had a few copies printed for\r\nprivate friends. He died in the Charterhouse 27 Sept. 1715. A tract\r\nentitled Hell Torments not Eternal was published in 1739.\r\n\r\nBurnett (James), Lord Monboddo, a learned Scotch writer and judge,\r\nwas b. Monboddo, Oct. 1714. He adopted the law as his profession,\r\nbecame a celebrated advocate, and was made a judge in 1767. His\r\nwork on the Origin and Progress of Language (published anonymously\r\n1773-92), excited much derision by his studying man as one of the\r\nanimals and collecting facts about savage tribes to throw light on\r\ncivilisation. He first maintained that the orang-outang was allied\r\nto the human species. He also wrote on Ancient Metaphysics. He was\r\na keen debater and discussed with Hume, Adam Smith, Robertson, and\r\nLord Kames. Died in Edinburgh, 26 May, 1799.\r\n\r\nBurnouf (Emile Louis), French writer, b. Valonges, 25 Aug. 1821.

His heresy is pronounced in his work\r\non the Science of Religions, 1878, in his Contemporary Catholicism,\r\nand Life and Thought, 1886.\r\n\r\nBurnouf (Eugène), French Orientalist, cousin of the preceding;\r\nb. Paris, 12 Aug. 1801. He opened up to the Western world the Pali\r\nlanguage, and with it the treasures of Buddhism, whose essentially\r\nAtheistic character he maintained. To him also we are largely indebted\r\nfor a knowledge of Zend and of the Avesta of the Zoroastrians. He\r\ntranslated numerous Oriental works and wrote a valuable Introduction\r\nto the History of Indian Buddhism. Died at Paris, 28 May, 1852.\r\n\r\nBurns (Robert), Scotland's greatest poet, b. near Ayr, 25\r\nJan. 1759. His father was a small farmer, of enlightened views. The\r\nlife and works of Burns are known throughout the world. His\r\nFreethought is evident from such productions as the \"Holy Fair,\"\r\n\"The Kirk's Alarm,\" and \"Holy Willie's Prayer,\" and many passages in\r\nprivate letters to his most familiar male friends. Died at Dumfries,\r\n21 July, 1796.\r\n\r\nBurr (William Henry), American author, b. 1819, Gloversville, N.Y.,\r\ngraduated at Union College, Schenectady, became a shorthand reporter\r\nto the Senate. In 1869 he retired and devoted himself to literary\r\nresearch. He is the anonymous author of Revelations of Antichrist, a\r\nlearned book which exposes the obscurity of the origin of Christianity,\r\nand seeks to show that the historical Jesus lived almost a century\r\nbefore the Christian era. He has also written several pamphlets:\r\nThomas Paine was Junius, 1880: Self Contradictions of the Bible;\r\nIs the Bible a Lying Humbug? A Roman Catholic Canard, etc. He has\r\nalso frequently contributed to the Boston Investigator, the New York\r\nTruthseeker, and the Ironclad Age of Indianapolis.\r\n\r\nBurton (Sir Richard Francis), traveller, linguist, and author,\r\nb. Barham House, Herts, 19 March, 1821. Intended for the Church,\r\nhe matriculated at Oxford, but in 1842 entered the East India\r\nCompany's service, served on the staff of Sir C. Napier, and soon\r\nacquired reputation as an intrepid explorer. In '51 he returned to\r\nEngland and started for Mecca and Medina, visiting those shrines\r\nunsuspected, as a Moslem pilgrim. He was chief of the staff of the\r\nOsmanli cavalry in the Crimean war, and has made many remarkable and\r\ndangerous expeditions in unknown lands; he discovered and opened\r\nthe lake regions in Central Africa and explored the highlands of\r\nBrazil. He has been consul at Fernando Po, Santos, Damascus, and\r\nsince 1872 at Trieste, and speaks over thirty languages. His latest\r\nwork is a new translation of The Thousand Nights and a Night in 10\r\nvols. Being threatened with a prosecution, he intended justifying\r\n\"literal naturalism\" from the Bible. Burton's knowledge of Arabic is\r\nso perfect that when he used to read the tales to Arabs, they would\r\nroll on the ground in fits of laughter.\r\n\r\nButler (Samuel), poet, b. in Strensham, Worcestershire, Feb. 1612. In\r\nearly life he came under the influence of Selden. He studied painting,\r\nand is said to have painted a head of Cromwell from life. He became\r\nclerk to Sir Samuel Luke, one of Cromwell's Generals, whom he has\r\nsatirised as Hudibras. This celebrated burlesque poem appeared in 1663\r\nand became famous, but, although the king and court were charmed with\r\nits wit, the author was allowed to remain in poverty and obscurity\r\ntill he died at Covent Garden, London, 25 Sept. 1680. Butler expressed\r\nthe opinion that\r\n\r\n\r\n        \"Religion is the interest of churches\r\n        That sell in other worlds in this to purchase.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nButtmann (Philipp Karl), German philologist, b. Frankfort, 5\r\nDec. 1764. Became librarian of the Royal Library at Berlin. He edited\r\nmany of the Greek Classics, wrote on the Myth of the Deluge, 1819,\r\nand a learned work on Mythology, 1828.

Born\r\nat Evreux, 1 March, 1760; he died from starvation when hiding after\r\nthe suppression of his party June, 1793.\r\n\r\nByelinsky (Vissarion G.) See Belinsky.\r\n\r\nByron (George Gordon Noel) Lord, b. London, 22 Jan. 1788. He succeeded\r\nhis grand-uncle William in 1798; was sent to Harrow and Cambridge. In\r\n1807 he published his Hours of Idleness, and awoke one morning to find\r\nhimself famous. His power was, however, first shown in his English\r\nBards and Scotch Reviewers, in which he satirised his critics, 1809. He\r\nthen travelled on the Continent, the result of which was seen in his\r\nChilde Harold's Pilgrimage and other works. He married 2 Jan. 1815,\r\nbut a separation took place in the following year. Lord Byron then\r\nresided in Italy, where he made the acquaintance of Shelley. In 1823\r\nhe devoted his name and fortune to the cause of the Greek revolution,\r\nbut was seized with fever and died at Missolonghi, 19 April, 1824. His\r\ndrama of Cain: a Mystery, 1822, is his most serious utterance,\r\nand it shows a profound contempt for religious dogma. This feeling\r\nis also exhibited in his magnificent burlesque poem, The Vision\r\nof Judgment, which places him at the head of English satirists. In\r\nhis letters to the Rev. Francis Hodgson, 1811, he distinctly says:\r\n\"I do not believe in any revealed religion.... I will have nothing\r\nto do with your immortality; we are miserable enough in this life,\r\nwithout the absurdity of speculating upon another.... The basis of\r\nyour religion is injustice; the Son of God, the pure, the immaculate,\r\nthe innocent, is sacrificed for the guilty,\" etc.\r\n\r\nCabanis (Pierre Jean George), called by Lange \"the father of the\r\nmaterialistic physiology,\" b. Conac, 5 June, 1757. Became pupil\r\nof Condillac and friend of Mirabeau, whom he attended in his last\r\nillness, of which he published an account 1791. He was also intimate\r\nwith Turgot, Condorcet, Holbach, Diderot, and other distinguished\r\nFreethinkers, and was elected member of the Institute and of the\r\nCouncil of Five Hundred in the Revolution. His works are mostly\r\nmedical, the chief being Des Rapports du Physique et du Morale de\r\nl'Homme, in which he contends that thoughts are a secretion of the\r\nbrain. Died Rueil, near Paris, 5 May, 1808.\r\n\r\nCæsalpinus (Andreas), Italian philosopher of the Renaissance,\r\nb. Arezzo, Tuscany, 1519. He became Professor of Botany at Pisa, and\r\nLinnæus admits his obligations to his work, De Plantis, 1583. He also\r\nwrote works on metals and medicine, and showed acquaintance with the\r\ncirculation of the blood. In a work entitled Demonum Investigatio,\r\nhe contends that \"possession\" by devils is amenable to medical\r\ntreatment. His Quæstionum Peripateticarum, in five books, Geneva,\r\n1568, was condemned as teaching a Pantheistic doctrine similar to\r\nthat of Spinoza. Bishop Parker denounced him. Died 23 Feb. 1603.\r\n\r\nCæsar (Caius Julius), the \"foremost man of all this world,\" equally\r\nrenowned as soldier, statesman, orator, and writer, b. 12 July,\r\n100 B.C., of noble family. His life, the particulars of which are\r\nwell known, was an extraordinary display of versatility, energy,\r\ncourage, and magnanimity. He justified the well-known line of Pope,\r\n\"Cæsar the world's great master and his own.\" His military talents\r\nelevated him to the post of dictator, but this served to raise against\r\nhim a band of aristocratic conspirators, by whom he was assassinated,\r\n15 March, 44 B.C. His Commentaries are a model of insight and clear\r\nexpression. Sallust relates that he questioned the existence of\r\na future state in the presence of the Roman senate. Froude says:\r\n\"His own writings contain nothing to indicate that he himself had any\r\nreligious belief at all. He saw no evidence that the gods practically\r\ninterfered in human affairs.... He held to the facts of this life and\r\nto his own convictions; and as he found no reason for supposing that\r\nthere was a life beyond the grave he did not pretend to expect it.\"\r\n\r\nCahuac (John), bookseller, revised an edition of Palmer's Principles\r\nof Nature, 1819. For this he was prosecuted at the instance of the\r\n\"Vice Society,\" but the matter was compromised. He was also prosecuted\r\nfor selling the Republican, 1820.\r\n\r\nCalderino (Domizio), a learned writer of the Renaissance, b. in 1445,\r\nin the territory of Verona, and lived at Rome, where he was professor\r\nof literature, in 1477.

Educated at\r\nCambridge, entered the ministry in 1843, but resigned his curacy about\r\n1856 on account of his change of opinions, which he recounts in his\r\npreface to Reverberations, 1876. Mr. Call is of the Positivist school,\r\nand has contributed largely to the Fortnightly and Westminster Reviews.\r\n\r\nCallet (Pierre Auguste), French politician, b. St. Etienne, 27\r\nOct. 1812; became editor of the Gazette of France till 1840. In 1848\r\nhe was nominated Republican representative. At the coup d'état of 2\r\nDec. 1851, he took refuge in Belgium. He returned to France, but was\r\nimprisoned for writing against the Empire. In 1871, Callet was again\r\nelected representative for the department of the Loire.

He entered the Dominican order, but was too much\r\nattracted by the works of Telesio to please his superiors. In 1590\r\nhis Philosophia Sensibus Demonstratio was printed at Naples. Being\r\nprosecuted, he fled to Rome, and thence to Florence, Venice,\r\nand Padua. At Bologna some of his MS. fell into the hands of the\r\nInquisition, and he was arrested. He ably defended himself and was\r\nacquitted. Returning to Calabria in 1599, he was arrested on charges\r\nof heresy and conspiracy against the Spanish Government of Naples,\r\nand having appealed to Rome, was sentenced to perpetual imprisonment\r\nin the prison of the Holy Office. He was put to the torture seven\r\ntimes, his torments on one occasion extending over forty hours, but\r\nhe refused to confess. He was dragged from one prison to another for\r\ntwenty-seven years, during which he wrote some sonnets, a history of\r\nthe Spanish monarchy, and several philosophical works. On 15 May,\r\n1626, he was released by the intervention of Pope Urban VIII. He\r\nwas obliged to fly from Rome to France, where he met Gassendi. He\r\nalso visited Descartes in Holland. Julian Hibbert remarked that\r\nhis Atheismus Triumphatus--Atheism Subdued, 1631, would be better\r\nentitled Atheismus Triumphans--Atheism Triumphant--as the author puts\r\nhis strongest arguments on the heterodox side. In his City of the Sun,\r\nCampanella follows Plato and More in depicting an ideal republic and a\r\ntime when a new era of earthly felicity should begin. Hallam says \"The\r\nstrength of Campanella's genius lay in his imagination.\" His \"Sonnets\"\r\nhave been translated by J. A. Symonds. Died Paris, 21 May, 1639.\r\n\r\nCampbell (Alexander), Socialist of Glasgow, b. about the beginning\r\nof the century. He early became a Socialist, and was manager at\r\nthe experiment at Orbiston under Abram Combe, of whom he wrote\r\na memoir. Upon the death of Combe, 1827, he became a Socialist\r\nmissionary in England. He took an active part in the co-operative\r\nmovement, and in the agitation for an unstamped press, for which he\r\nwas tried and imprisoned at Edinburgh, 1833-4. About 1849 he returned\r\nto Glasgow and wrote on the Sentinel. In 1867 he was presented with\r\na testimonial and purse of 90 sovereigns by admirers of his exertions\r\nin the cause of progress. Died about 1873.\r\n\r\nCampion (William), a shoemaker, who became one of R. Carlile's\r\nshopmen; tried 8 June, 1824, for selling Paine's Age of Reason. After\r\na spirited defence he was found guilty and sentenced to three years'\r\nimprisonment. In prison he edited, in conjunction with J. Clarke,\r\nE. Hassell, and T. R. Perry, the Newgate Monthly Magazine, to which\r\nhe contributed some thoughtful papers, from Sept. 1824, to Aug. 1826,\r\nwhen he was removed to the Compter.\r\n\r\nCanestrini (Giovanni), Italian naturalist, b. Rerò, 1835. He studied\r\nat Vienna, and in '60 was nominated Professor of Natural History at\r\nGeneva.

He has written\r\nupon the Origin of Man, which has gone through two editions, Milan,\r\n'66-'70, and on the Theory of Evolution, Turin, '77. He was appointed\r\nProfessor of Zoology, Anatomy and Comparative Physiology at Padua,\r\nwhere he has published a Memoir of Charles Darwin, '82.\r\n\r\nCardano (Girolamo), better known as Jerome Cardan, Italian\r\nmathematician, and physician, b. Pavia, 24 Sept. 1501. He studied\r\nmedicine, but was excluded from the Milan College of Physicians on\r\naccount of illegitimate birth. He and his young wife were at one time\r\ncompelled to take refuge in the workhouse. It is not strange that his\r\nfirst work was an exposure of the fallacies of the faculty. A fortunate\r\ncure brought him into notice and he journeyed to Scotland as the\r\nmedical adviser of the Archbishop of St. Andrews, 1551. In 1563 he was\r\narrested at Bologna for heresy, but was released, although deprived of\r\nhis professorship. He died at Rome, 20 Sept. 1576, having, it is said,\r\nstarved himself to verify his own prediction of his death. Despite\r\nsome superstition, Cardano did much to forward science, especially\r\nby his work on Algebra, and in his works De Subtilitate Rerum and De\r\nVarietate Rerum, amid much that is fanciful, perceived the universality\r\nof natural law and the progressive evolution of life. Scaliger accused\r\nhim of Atheism. Pünjer says \"Cardanus deserves to be named along with\r\nTelesius as one of the principal founders of Natural Philosophy.\"\r\n\r\nCarducci (Giosuè), Italian poet and Professor of Italian Literature at\r\nthe University of Bologna, b. Pietrasantra, in the province of Lucca,\r\n27 July, 1836. As early as '49 he cried, Abasso tutti i re! viva la\r\nrepublica--Down with all kings! Long live the republic! Sprung into\r\nfame by his Hymn to Satan, '69, by which he intended the spirit of\r\nresistance. He has written many poems and satires in which he exhibits\r\nhimself an ardent Freethinker and Republican. At the end of '57 he\r\nwrote his famous verse \"Il secoletto vil che cristianeggia\"--\"This\r\nvile christianising century.\" In '60 he became professor of Greek\r\nin Bologna University, being suspended for a short while in '67 for\r\nan address to Mazzini. In '76 he was elected as republican deputy to\r\nthe Italian Parliament for Lugo di Romagna.\r\n\r\nCarlile (Eliza Sharples), second wife of Richard Carlile, came from\r\nLancashire during the imprisonment of Carlile and Taylor, 1831,\r\ndelivered discourses at the Rotunda, and started a journal, the Isis,\r\nwhich lasted from 11 Feb. to 15 Dec. 1832. The Isis was dedicated\r\nto the young women of England \"until superstition is extinct,\"\r\nand contained Frances Wright's discourses, in addition to those\r\nby Mrs. Carlile, who survived till '61. Mr. Bradlaugh lodged with\r\nMrs. Carlile at the Warner Place Institute, in 1849. She had three\r\nchildren, Hypatia, Theophila and Julian, of whom the second is\r\nstill living.\r\n\r\nCarlile (Jane), first wife of R. Carlile, who carried on his business\r\nduring his imprisonment, was proceeded against, and sentenced to two\r\nyears' imprisonment, 1821.

Ashburton, Devon, 8 Dec. 1790. He was apprenticed to a\r\ntin-plate worker, and followed that business till he was twenty-six,\r\nwhen, having read the works of Paine, he began selling works like\r\nWooler's Black Dwarf, which Government endeavored to suppress. Sherwin\r\noffered him the dangerous post of publisher of the Republican, which\r\nhe accepted. He then published Southey's Wat Tyler, reprinted the\r\npolitical works of Paine and the parodies for which Hone was tried, but\r\nwhich cost Carlile eighteen weeks' imprisonment. In 1818 he published\r\nPaine's Theological Works. The prosecution instituted induced him to\r\ngo on printing similar works, such as Palmer's Principles of Nature,\r\nWatson Refuted, Jehovah Unveiled, etc. By Oct. 1819, he had six\r\nindictments to answer, on two of which he was tried from 12 to 16\r\nOctober. He read the whole of the Age of Reason in his defence, in\r\norder to have it in the report of the trial. He was found guilty and\r\nsentenced (16 Nov.) to fifteen hundred pounds fine and three years'\r\nimprisonment in Dorchester Gaol. During his imprisonment his business\r\nwas kept on by a succession of shopmen. Refusing to find securities\r\nnot to publish, he was kept in prison till 18 Nov. 1835, when he\r\nwas liberated unconditionally. During his imprisonment he edited\r\nthe Republican, which extended to fourteen volumes. He also edited\r\nthe Deist, the Moralist, the Lion (four volumes), the Prompter (for\r\nNo. 3 of which he again suffered thirty-two months' imprisonment),\r\nand the Gauntlet. Amongst his writings are An Address to Men of\r\nScience, The Gospel according to R. Carlile, What is God?

Showing early\r\nability he was intended for the Kirk, and educated at the University\r\nof Edinburgh. He, however, became a tutor, and occupied his leisure\r\nin translating from the German. He married Jane Welsh 17 Oct. 1826,\r\nand wrote in the London Magazine and Edinburgh Review many masterly\r\ncritical articles, notably on Voltaire, Diderot, Burns, and German\r\nliterature. In 1833-4 his Sartor Resartus appeared in Fraser's\r\nMagazine. In '34 he removed to London and began writing the French\r\nRevolution, the MS. of the first vol. of which he confided to Mill,\r\nwith whom it was accidentally burnt. He re-wrote the work without\r\ncomplaint, and it was published in '37. He then delivered a course\r\nof lectures on \"German Literature\" and on \"Heroes, Hero-Worship, and\r\nthe Heroic in History,\" in which he treats Mahomet as the prophet\r\n\"we are freest to speak of.\" His Past and Present was published in\r\n'43. In '45 appeared Oliver Cromwell's Letters and Speeches. In\r\n'50 he published Latter-Day Pamphlets, which contains his most\r\ndistinctive political and social doctrines, and in the following year\r\nhis Life of John Sterling, in which his heresy clearly appears. His\r\nlargest work is his History of the Life and Times of Frederick the\r\nGreat, in 10 vols. He was elected rector of Edinburgh University in\r\n'65. Died 5 Feb. 1881. Mr. Froude, in his Biography of Carlyle, says,\r\n\"We have seen him confessing to Irving that he did not believe as his\r\nfriend did in the Christian religion.\" ... \"the special miraculous\r\noccurrences of sacred history were not credible to him.\"\r\n\r\nCarneades, sceptical philosopher, b. Cyrene about B.C. 213. He went\r\nearly to Athens, and attended the lectures of the Stoics, learning\r\nlogic from Diogenes. In the year 155, he was chosen with other\r\ndeputies to go to Rome to deprecate a fine which had been placed on\r\nthe Athenians. During his stay at Rome he attracted great attention\r\nby his philosophical orations. Carneades attacked the very idea of\r\na God at once infinite and an individual. He denied providence and\r\ndesign. Many of his arguments are preserved in Cicero's Academics\r\nand De Natura Deorum. Carneades left no written works; his views\r\nseem to have been systematised by his follower Clitomachus. He died\r\nB.C. 129. Carneades is described as a man of unwearied industry.

On the death of St. Simon ('25) Comte\r\ndevoted himself to the elaboration of an original system of scientific\r\nthought, which, in the opinion of some able judges, entitles him to\r\nbe called the Bacon of the nineteenth century. Mill speaks of him as\r\nthe superior of Descartes and Leibniz. In '25 he married, but the\r\nunion proved unhappy. In the following year he lectured, but broke\r\ndown under an attack of brain fever, which occasioned his detention\r\nin an asylum. He speedily recovered, and in '28 resumed his lectures,\r\nwhich were attended by men like Humboldt, Ducrotay, Broussais, Carnot,\r\netc. In '30 he put forward the first volumes of his Course of Positive\r\nPhilosophy, which in '42 was completed by the publication of the sixth\r\nvolume.

He\r\nresolutely sets aside all theology and metaphysics, coordinates\r\nthe sciences and substitutes the service of man for the worship of\r\nGod. Mr. J. Cotter Morison says \"He belonged to that small class\r\nof rare minds, whose errors are often more valuable and stimulating\r\nthan other men's truths.\" He died of cancer in the stomach at Paris,\r\n5 Sept. 1857.\r\n\r\nCondillac (Etienne Bonnot de), French philosopher, b.

Rousseau, who called him \"a transcendent genius,\" visited\r\nDiderot in prison, where he remained three years. Diderot projected the\r\nfamous Encyclopédie, which he edited with Alembert, and he contributed\r\nsome of the most important articles. With very inadequate recompense,\r\nand amidst difficulties that would have appalled an ordinary editor,\r\nDiderot superintended the undertaking for many years (1751-65). He also\r\ncontributed to other important works, such as Raynal's Philosophic\r\nHistory, L'Esprit, by Helvetius, and The System of Nature and other\r\nworks of his friend D'Holbach.

Didot, \"owes him much for his treatises, translations,\r\nand poesies.\" Dolet's biographer, M. Joseph Boulmier, calls him \"le\r\nChrist de la pensée libre.\" Philosophy has alone the right, says\r\nHenri Martin, to claim Dolet on its side. His English biographer,\r\nR. C.

Her Scenes of Clerical Life, Adam\r\nBede, Mill on the Floss, Silas Marner, Romola, Felix Holt, Middlemarch,\r\nDaniel Deronda, and Theophrastus Such have become classics. As a poet,\r\n\"George Eliot\" does not rank so high, but her little piece, \"Oh,\r\nmay I join the choir invisible,\" well expresses the emotion of the\r\nReligion of Humanity, and her Spanish Gipsy she allowed was \"a mass\r\nof Positivism.\" Lewes died in 1878, and within two years she married\r\nhis friend, J. W. Cross. Her new happiness was short-lived. She died\r\n22 Dec. 1880, and is buried with Lewes at Highgate.\r\n\r\nEllero (Pietro) Italian jurisconsult, b.

On his return he settled at Concord, giving occasional\r\nlectures, most of which have been published. He wrote to the Dial, a\r\ntranscendentalist paper. Tending to idealistic pantheism, but without\r\nsystematic philosophy, all his writings are most suggestive, and he\r\nis always the champion of mental freedom, self-reliance, and the free\r\npursuit of science.

His vigorous, if eccentric, individuality attracted\r\nCarlyle, who said to Mrs. Gilchrist, \"Emerson was a Freethinker who\r\nlooked on his neighbor, the parson, as a humbug.

Influenced by the works of Demokritos, he occupied\r\nhimself with philosophy. He purchased a garden in Athens, in which he\r\nestablished his school. Although much calumniated, he is now admitted\r\nto have been a man of blameless life. According to Cicero, he had no\r\nbelief in the gods, but did not attack their existence, in order not\r\nto offend the prejudices of the Athenians. In physics he adopted the\r\natomic theory, and denied immortality. He taught that pleasure is the\r\nsovereign good; but by pleasure he meant no transient sensation, but\r\npermanent tranquility of mind. He wrote largely, but his works are\r\nlost.

Among his works are\r\nlyrical poems, which often remind us of Heine; an unfinished epic,\r\nEl Pelayo; and El Diablo-Mundo (the Devil-World), a fine poem, due\r\nto the inspiration of Faust and Don Juan. Espronceda was a thorough\r\nsceptic. In his Song of the Pirate he asks, \"Who is my God?--Liberty\";\r\nand in his concluding lines to a star he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n                I unheedingly follow my path,\r\n                At the mercy of winds and of waves.\r\n                Wrapt thus within the arms of Fate,\r\n                What care I if lost or saved.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstienne (Henri), the ablest of a family of learned French printers,\r\nknown in England as Stephens; b.

To you, nothing is\r\nmore beautiful than the Gospel; to me, a thousand written pages of\r\nancient and modern inspired men are equally beautiful.\" Goethe was\r\nopposed to asceticism, and Pfleiderer admits \"stood in opposition\r\nto Christianity not merely on points of theological form, but to\r\na certain extent on points of substance too.\" Goethe devoted much\r\nattention to science, and he attempted to explain the metamorphosis\r\nof plants on evolutionary principles in 1790.

For this\r\nhe twice suffered sentences of six months' imprisonment. He afterwards\r\npublished The Unstamped, and his persistency had much to do in removing\r\nthe taxes.

In 1765 he visited England, and from\r\nthis time was untiring in his issue of Freethought works, usually put\r\nout under pseudonyms. Thus he wrote and had published at Amsterdam\r\nChristianity Unveiled, attributed to Boulanger. The Spirit of the\r\nClergy, translated, from the English of Trenchard and Gordon, was\r\npartly rewritten by d'Holbach, 1767.

In 1770 he published his principal work The\r\nSystem of Nature, or The Laws of the Physical and Moral World. This\r\ntext-book of atheistic philosophy, in which d'Holbach was assisted\r\nby Diderot, professed to be the posthumous work of Mirabaud. It made\r\na great sensation. Within two years he published a sort of summary\r\nunder the title of Good Sense, attributed to the curé Meslier. In\r\n1773 he wrote on Natural Politics and the Social System.

It is said there were seven hundred in Jena alone. What\r\nbecame of him and them is unknown. A letter dated from Rome gives his\r\nprinciples. He denied the existence of either God or Devil, deemed\r\nchurches and priests useless, and held that there is no life beyond\r\nthe present, for which conscience is a sufficient guide, taking the\r\nplace of the Bible, which contains great contradictions.

Falling ill, he noticed that his faculties fluctuated with\r\nhis physical state, and drew therefrom materialistic conclusions. The\r\nboldness with which he made his ideas known lost him his place, and he\r\ntook refuge in Holland. Here he published The Natural History of the\r\nSoul, under the pretence of its being a translation from the English\r\nof Charp [Sharp], 1745.

His father\r\nwas a Quaker and staymaker, and Paine was brought up to the trade. He\r\nleft home while still young, went to London and Sandwich, where he\r\nmarried the daughter of an exciseman, and entered the excise. He\r\nwas selected by his official associates to embody their wants in a\r\npaper, and on this work he displayed such talent that Franklin, then\r\nin London, suggested America as a good field for his abilities. Paine\r\nwent in 1774, and soon found work for his pen. He became editor of the\r\nPennsylvanian Magazine and contributed to the Pennsylvanian journal\r\na strong anti-slavery essay. Common Sense, published early in 1776,\r\nadvocating absolute independence for America, did more than anything\r\nelse to precipitate the great events of that year. Each number of\r\nthe Crisis, which appeared during the war, was read by Washington's\r\norder to each regiment in the service. Paine subscribed largely\r\nto the army, and served for a short time himself. After peace was\r\ndeclared, congress voted him three thousand dollars, and the state\r\nof New York gave him a large farm. Paine turned his attention to\r\nmechanics, and invented the tubular iron bridge, which he endeavored\r\nto introduce in Europe. Reaching France during the Revolution,\r\nhe published a pamphlet advocating the abolition of royalty. In\r\n1791 he published his Rights of Man, in reply to Burke. For this\r\nhe was outlawed. Escaping from England, he went to France, where he\r\nwas elected to the Convention.

During this time\r\nhe wrote the first part of the Age of Reason, which he completed\r\non his release. This famous book, though vulnerable in some minor\r\npoints of criticism, throws a flood of light on Christian dogmas,\r\nand has had a more extended sale than any other Freethought work. As\r\na natural consequence, Paine has been an object of incessant slander\r\nby the clergy. Paine died at New York 8 June, 1809, and, by his own\r\ndirection was buried on his farm at New Rochelle. Cobbett is said to\r\nhave disinterred him and brought his bones to England.\r\n\r\nPajot (François).

He says that \"the more superstitious people are,\r\nalways the more vicious; and the more they believe, the less they\r\npractice.\" Atheism furnishes no man with arguments to be vicious;\r\nbut superstition, or what the world made by religion, is the greatest\r\npossible encouragement to vice, by setting up something as religion,\r\nwhich shall atone and commute for the want of virtue.

He wrote the history of his own\r\ntime in 31 books, now lost, and a Natural History in 37 books, one\r\nof the most precious monuments of antiquity, in which his Epicurean\r\nAtheism appears. Being with the fleet at Misenum, 24 Aug. A.D. 79,\r\nhe observed the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, and landing to assist\r\nthe inhabitants was himself suffocated by the noxious vapors.\r\n\r\nPlumacher (Olga), German pessimist, follower of Hartmann, and authoress\r\nof a work on Pessimism in the Past and Future, Heidelberg, 1884.

His Parallel Lives of forty-six Greeks and Romans have made\r\nhim immortal. He wrote numerous other anecdotal and ethical works,\r\nincluding a treatise on Superstition. He condemned the vulgar notions\r\nof Deity, and remarked, in connection with the deeds popularly ascribed\r\nto the gods, that he would rather men said there was no Plutarch than\r\ntraduce his character. In other words, superstition is more impious\r\nthan Atheism. Died about A.D. 120.\r\n\r\nPoe (Edgar Allan), American poet, grandson of General Poe, who figured\r\nin the war of independence, b.

He then took to literary employment in Baltimore and wrote many\r\nstories, collected as the Tales of Mystery, Imagination, and Humor. In\r\n'45 appeared The Raven and other Poems, which proved him the most\r\nmusical and dextrous of American poets. In '48 he published Eureka,\r\na Prose Poem, which, though comparatively little known, he esteemed\r\nhis greatest work. It indicates pantheistic views of the universe. His\r\npersonal appearance was striking and one of his portraits is not\r\nunlike that of James Thomson.

Next year he was\r\nappointed professor of philosophy at Padua, teaching in concurrence\r\nwith Achillini. He afterwards taught the doctrines of Aristotle at\r\nFerrara and Bologna. His treatise De Immortalitate Animæ, 1516, gave\r\ngreat offence by denying the philosophical foundation of the doctrine\r\nof the immortality of the soul. The work was burnt by the hangman at\r\nVenice, and it is said Cardinal Bembo's intercession with Pope Leo\r\nX. only saved Pomponazzi from ecclesiastical procedure. Among his works\r\nis a treatise on Fate, Free Will, etc. Pomponazzi was a diminutive\r\nman, and was nicknamed \"Peretto.\" He held that doubt was necessary\r\nfor the development of knowledge, and left an unsullied reputation\r\nfor upright conduct and sweet temper.

Some have supposed that\r\nhe was of Jewish faith, and first embraced and then afterwards\r\nrejected Christianity. It is certain he was a man of learning and\r\nintelligence; the friend as well as the disciple of Plotinus. He wrote\r\n(in Greek) a famous work in fifteen books against the Christians, some\r\nfragments of which alone remain in the writings of his opponents. It\r\nis certain he showed acquaintance with the Jewish and Christian\r\nwritings, exposed their contradictions, pointed out the dispute between\r\nPeter and Paul, and referred Daniel to the time of Antiochus Epiphanes.\r\nHe wrote many other works, among which are lives of Plotinus and\r\nPythagorus.

Brought up for the church, he nevertheless became intimate with\r\nDiderot and contributed the article Certitude to the Encyclopédie. On\r\nthe 18th Nov. 1751 he presented to the Sorbonne a thesis for the\r\ndoctorate, remarkable as the first open attack on Christianity by\r\na French theologian. He maintained many propositions on the soul,\r\nthe origin of society, the laws of Moses, miracles, etc., contrary\r\nto the dogmas of the Church, and compared the cures recorded in the\r\nGospels to those attributed to Esculapius. The thesis made a great\r\nscandal. His opinions were condemned by Pope Benedict XIV., and he\r\nfled to Holland for safety. Recommended to Frederick the Great by\r\nd'Alembert he was received with favor at Berlin, and became reader to\r\nthat monarch, who wrote a very anti-Christian preface to de Prades'\r\nwork on ecclesiastical history, published as Abrége de l'Histoire\r\necclesiastique de Fleury, Berne (Berlin) 1766.

Fieldhead, near\r\nLeeds, 18 March, 1733. Brought up as a Calvinist, he found his way\r\nto broad Unitarianism. Famous as a pneumatic chemist, he defended the\r\ndoctrine of philosophical necessity, and in a dissertation annexed to\r\nhis edition of Hartley expressed doubts of the immateriality of the\r\nsentient principal in man. This doctrine he forcibly supported in\r\nhis Disquisitions on Matter and Spirit, 1777. Through the obloquy\r\nthese works produced, he lost his position as librarian to Lord\r\nShelburne. He then removed to Birmingham, and became minister of\r\nan independent Unitarian congregation, and occupied himself on his\r\nHistory of the Corruptions of Christianity and History of the Early\r\nOpinions Concerning Jesus Christ, which involved him in controversy\r\nwith Bishop Horsley and others.

After this he removed to Hackney, and was finally\r\ngoaded to seek an asylum in the United States, which he reached in\r\n1794. Even in America he endured some uneasiness on account of his\r\nopinions until Jefferson became president.

'75, formally\r\nrenounced that religion as irreconcilable with scientific facts. His\r\nremarks on the so-called Star of Bethlehem in The Universe of Suns,\r\nand other Science Gleanings, and his Sunday lectures, indicated his\r\nheresy. In '81 he started Knowledge, in which appeared many valuable\r\npapers, notably one (Jan. '87), \"The Beginning of Christianity.\" He\r\nentirely rejected the miraculous elements of the gospels, which he\r\nconsidered largely a rechauffé of solar myths. In other articles\r\nin the Freethinkers' Magazine and the Open Court he pointed out the\r\ncoincidence between the Christian stories and solar myths, and also\r\nwith stories found in Josephus. The very last article he published\r\nbefore his untimely death was a vindication of Colonel Ingersoll\r\nin his controversy with Gladstone in the North American Review.

He went to Epirus and the Greek\r\nIslands, and died about 411. He believed all things were in flux,\r\nand summed up his conclusions in the proposition that \"man is the\r\nmeasure of all things, both of that which exists and that which does\r\nnot exist.\" Grote, who defends the Sophists, says his philosophy \"had\r\nthe merit of bringing into forcible relief the essentially relative\r\nnature of cognition.\"\r\n\r\nPrudhomme (Sully).
