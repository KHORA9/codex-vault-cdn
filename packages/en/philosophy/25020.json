The Humanistic Nursing\r\nInquiry web site provides context for the major initiatives of\r\nhumanistic nursing, which celebrate the enduring and immutable ideals of\r\nHumanism that give us insight into the fundamental truths of being in\r\nthe world of nurses, patients, families, colleagues, and students.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREWORD to the 1976 Edition\r\n\r\nThese essays will evoke different reactions from different\r\nreaders. \"Well, I know that,\" for example, may be the reaction of a\r\nbeginner in nursing; \"I wouldn't have said it that way but I knew that\r\nis really nursing.\" \"Since they've given us a methodology,\" perhaps from\r\none more experienced in nursing; \"I'll give it a try.\" Others with still\r\nmore or different kinds of experience may respond, \"It's about time\r\nnurses put that into words; it's about time.\"\r\n\r\nTimely as these essays are I would prefer not to use up the foreword\r\nwith a listing of the crises, the \"eco-spasms,\" and scientific triumphs\r\nthat would document their timeliness. It is my pleasure, rather, to use\r\nthis opportunity to relate the six elements of my own reaction:\r\n\r\nNursing has a solitariness until we find it has many companions in\r\nphilosophy, science, and art.  It has a steadiness about its pace yet\r\nholds a potential for flights to higher elevations.  It is constantly\r\nchanging yet has an enduring component of permanence.  Good is the word\r\nwe use every day; our vision, however, is of excellence.  Its tasks\r\noften have the appearance of homeliness until we glimpse that kind of\r\nbeauty that is humanness.  Nursing even sings very softly because our\r\nears are attuned to \"a different drummer.\"\r\n\r\nLilyan Weymouth, R.N., M.S.  Northampton, Massachusetts October 1975\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE to the 1976 Edition\r\n\r\nOut of necessity nursing, as a profession, reflects the qualities of the\r\nculture in which it exists. In our culture for the past quarter of a\r\ncentury nursing has been assailed with rapid economic, technological,\r\nshortage- abundance, changing scenes' vicissitudes. In the individual\r\nnurse these arouse turmoil and uncertainty. These cultural stirrings\r\ninflame that part of the nurse's spirit capable of chaotic conflict and\r\ndoubt. Often she questions her professional identity. ''Just what is a\r\nnurse?\" Her nurse colleagues, other professionals, and nonprofessionals\r\nfreely, directly and indirectly-on television, in the theater, through\r\nthe news media and the literature-pummel her with their multitudinous\r\nvaried views.\r\n\r\nAs searching, wondering, reflecting, relating microcosms within this\r\nperplexing health nursing world for longer than a quarter of a century,\r\nwe present this book. Descriptively we view the chapters as hard-wrung,\r\nphilosophical foundations, synthesized extracts from our lived\r\nexperiences.  These metatheoretical essays on practice present an\r\nexistential alternative approach for a professional nurse's knowing and\r\nbecoming.\r\n\r\nThese conceptualized existents are available because Miss Marguerite\r\nL. Burt, formerly Chief of Nursing Service, Northport, N.Y. Veterans\r\nAdministration Hospital called them forth from us. These chapters are\r\nour response to her call. In 1972 Miss Burt requested us to develop a\r\ncourse for the professional nursing staff at Northport V.A.H. This book\r\nhas evolved from the original presentations offered to the ten\r\nparticipants in the first course. While we taught and worked with five\r\nsubsequent groups, we learned and continually revised and clarified our\r\nconceptualizations.  The course is entitled Humanistic Nursing.\r\n\r\nFifty-three nurses have been involved in this course. Interest,\r\nappreciation, wonderment, effort, and investment characteristically\r\ndepict their response. They convey that the humanistic nursing practice\r\ntheory reflects what nursing means to them. Their hungry approach to the\r\nsuggested readings has both surprised and pleased us. Our amazement\r\npersists over the participants' ability to concentratedly discuss\r\nabstract theory and concrete nursing practice for weekly day-long\r\nsessions over six-to nine-month periods. Presently requests to\r\nparticipate in the next humanistic nursing course are mounting from\r\nnurses both within and outside the Northport complex.\r\n\r\nThe course, the theory, and this book are the fruits of our individual\r\nand collaborative efforts. While sharing seminar responsibility for\r\ngraduate students in 1960, we began to dialogically and -dialectically\r\nstruggle with professional and /clinical nursing issues. Discussing and\r\nsearchingly questioning ourselves and our students became a\r\nvalue. Through conveying, struggling for clarification, openness to\r\nhonest argument, we grew in our awareness that each was moved beyond her\r\nbeginning thoughts.  Through reflection we have come to view, describe,\r\nand distinguish our dialogues as struggles with, and not against,\r\nothers' ideas. Differences in response are valued for what they can tell\r\nus of our chosen area-nursing.  So dialectical dialogue has gradually\r\nbecome our predominant teaching method. We convey our ideas, are open to\r\nothers' questions, struggle to clarify and really communicate, and\r\nquestion ourselves, and others. In the process of the humanistic nursing\r\ncourse, using this methodology, which is deliberate and, yet, natural\r\nand authentic for us, we and our professional nursing staff students\r\nhave learned and become more human, more questioning, more clinical, and\r\njust, more.\r\n\r\nWe value our moreness. Appreciating and valuing the effects of our\r\nactualizing selves as human beings, we must attest to our existential\r\nmodes of nurse being; our inner mandate is: share. Hence, Humanistic\r\nNursing has come into being.\r\n\r\nTo find the meaning of nursing we have returned \"to the thing itself,\"\r\nto the phenomenon of nursing as it occurs in the everyday world. Our\r\nreflections on nursing as a lived experience flowed into the realm of\r\nmetanursing. Obviously, these thoughts are only a beginning. They are\r\noffered in the hope of stimulating response and further development.\r\nDialogue may be difficult at first because humanistic nursing represents\r\none of our discipline's less articulated streams. Yet, it is a stream\r\ntraceable to nursing's foundation and, as such, is related to nursing's\r\nartistic, scientific, and technological currents. It is not being,\r\ncannot be, developed in opposition to them.\r\n\r\nScience and art are forms of human responses to the human situation.\r\nThey are valued in genuine humanism. Thus, the humanistic nursing\r\napproach does not reject advances in nursing technology, but rather it\r\ntries to increase their value by viewing their use within the\r\nperspective of the development of human potential. The same holds true\r\nfor scientific, artistic, and clinical developments in nursing\r\npractice. They are the necessary means through which and in which\r\nhumanistic nursing (a being and doing) is experienced and developed.\r\n\r\nAt this time when serious concern is being expressed about the survival\r\nof nursing as a profession, humanistic nursing offers a note of\r\noptimism.  By examining the values underlying practice, it focuses on\r\nthe meaning and means of nursing's particular' mode of interhuman\r\ncaring. It increases respect for that caring as a means of human\r\ndevelopment. Nurses have the privilege of being with persons who are\r\nexperiencing all the varied meanings of incarnate being with men and\r\nthings in time and space in the entire range from birth to death. They\r\nnot only have the opportunity to co-experience and co-search with\r\npatients the meaning of life, suffering, and death, but in the process\r\nthey may become and help others become more-more human.\r\n\r\nBeyond this, the humanistic nursing approach respects nursing experience\r\nas a source of wisdom. By describing and conceptualizing the phenomena\r\nexperienced in nursing situations, nurses could contribute to the\r\ndevelopment of nursing as a discipline. Even more, they could add to the\r\nknowledge of man.\r\n\r\nHumanistic nursing, then, is neither a break with nor a repetition of\r\nnursing's past. It is neither a rejection of nor a satisfaction with\r\nnursing's present. Rather it is an awakening to the possibilities of\r\nshaping our nursing world here and now and for the future.\r\n\r\nThanks to Miss Marguerite L. Burt are in order for she provoked our\r\nconceptualizations of our lived nursing worlds. Dr. Frederick H. Wescoe,\r\nwhile Chief of Nursing Service, Northport, N.Y., VAH administratively\r\nfacilitated the time and the means for our compiling these materials\r\ninto a manuscript. Past nursing students challenged and grappled with\r\nour ideas and theirs insisting always on our forwarding our\r\nthinking. Our consultants, Miss Lilyan Weymouth and Miss Rose Godbout,\r\nwere marvelous resources and counselors.\r\n\r\nImmediately we are most grateful to the participants in the six\r\nhumanistic nursing courses taught here at the Northport VAH. As nurses,\r\nthey received and accepted our expressed ideas to the extent of testing\r\nthem in the fires of their real lived nursing practice settings. While\r\nstruggling with our ideas and us, they gave to us. They were supportive,\r\nloving, and truly present with us in the community of nurses at\r\nNorthport, VAH. Miss Sue McCann, clinical nurse specialist, one of our\r\nfirst course participants, has read and reviewed our materials. More\r\nthan this Miss McCann has been a counselor, resource person, and a\r\ndependable friend in our humanistic nursing effort of the last three\r\nyears.  We hope our chapters give back to others, at least just a part\r\nof what we have received from them in our travels in the nursing world.\r\n\r\nJ.G.P\r\nL.T.Z.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's Note: to the 1988 Edition\r\n\r\nItalic text has been marked as _text_.\r\nBold text has been marked as ~text~.\r\nObvious punctuation errors in the original have been corrected.\r\nOther corrections are noted at the end of the text.\r\nThe original page numbers have been retained, e.g. {1} marks the start\r\nof page 1 in the original text.]\r\n\r\nHUMANISTIC NURSING\r\n\r\n_Josephine G. Paterson, DNSc, RN_\r\n_Loretta T. Zderad, PhD, RN_\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n    Somewhere there's a child a crying\r\n    Somewhere there's a child a crying\r\n    Somewhere there's a child a crying\r\n    Crying for freedom in South Africa.[1]\r\n\r\nBut until someone hears the cry and responds, the child will continue to\r\nsuffer the oppression of the current South African regime; and the world\r\nwill continue to be less than it could be. To cry aloud when there seems\r\nno chance of being heard, belies a hope--perhaps an inherently human\r\ntrait--that someone, somewhere, somehow will hear that cry and respond\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nThis same hope, that someone would hear and respond, allowed existential\r\npsychologist Viktor Frankl to survive the systematic torture and\r\ndegradation in Nazi death camps. As Frankl and others sought their way,\r\nthey found meaning and salvation \"through love and in love;\" and by\r\nchoosing to believe that \"life still waited for him, that a human being\r\nwaited for his return.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThere is power in the call of one person and the potential response of\r\nanother; and incredible power when the potential response becomes real.\r\nThere is the power for each person to change as she becomes more than\r\nshe was before the dialogue. There is the power to transcend the\r\nsituation as two people engage the events that are whirling around them\r\nand together try to make sense of their worlds and find a meaning to\r\ntheir existence. When the call and response between two people is as\r\nhonest as it can be, there is the revolutionary power which the poet\r\nMuriel Rukeyser speaks of:\r\n\r\n    What would happen if one woman told the truth about her life?\r\n      The world would split open.[3]\r\n\r\n{iv}\r\n\r\nThe call and response of an authentic dialogue between a nurse and\r\npatient has great power--the power to change the lived experiences of\r\nboth patient and nurse, to change the situation, to change the world. It\r\nis the same authenticity we search for in relationships with our friends\r\nand lovers. The person who really listens to what we are saying, who\r\nreally tries to understand our lived experiences of the world and who\r\nasks the same from us. When found, it brings the same exhilarating\r\nfeeling of self-affirmation and the comforting feeling of well-being.\r\n\r\nFor, if as holistic beings we are the implicate order explicating\r\nitself, as suggested by Bohm[4] and Newman[5] among others, then the\r\nresponsibilities of those who would help (e.g., nurses) include making\r\nsense out of the chaos that can occur as illness disrupts past order and\r\nas the ever-present threat of non-being disrupts all order. When we are\r\nsuccessful in helping patients and their loved ones make sense of their\r\nlives by bringing meaning to them, we make sense of and bring meaning to\r\nour own.\r\n\r\nAnd when we help create meaning, it is easier to remember why we chose\r\nnursing and why we continue to choose it despite what an underpaid and\r\nundervalued job it has become in today's marketplace. These are the\r\nmoments when by a look or a word or a touch, the patient lets us know\r\nthat he understands what is happening to him, what his choices are, and\r\nwhat he is going to do; that he knows we know; and that each knows that\r\nthe other knows. When we get past our science and theories, our\r\ntechnical prowess, our titles and positions of influence, it is this\r\nshared moment of authenticity--between patient and nurse--that makes us\r\nsmile and allows us to move forward in our own life projects.\r\n\r\nNurse educators who seek such authentic exchanges with their students\r\nenjoy similar moments. The same can be said of deans of schools of\r\nnursing, administrators of delivery systems, executives and staff of\r\nnursing and professional organizations, and colleagues on a research\r\nproject. It is the authentic dialogue between people that makes any\r\nactivity worthwhile regardless of whether or not it is called successful\r\nby others.\r\n\r\nWhen Josephine G. Paterson and Loretta T. Zderad first published their\r\nbook _Humanistic Nursing_ in 1976, society was in the midst of the new\r\nwomen's movement and nurses were going through the phase of\r\nassertiveness training, dressing for success, and learning to play the\r\ngames that mother never taught us. Since then, nurses have moved into\r\nmany sectors of society and have held power as we have never held it\r\nbefore. We have proved ourselves as politicians, administrators,\r\nresearchers, and writers. We have refined our abilities to assess,\r\ndiagnose, treat, and evaluate. We've raised money and balanced budgets.\r\nWe've networked, organized, and formed coalitions.\r\n\r\nYet, individually we are uneasy and collectively we are unable to\r\narticulate a vision clear enough so that others will join us. This\r\nre-issue of Paterson and {v} Zderad's classic work will help to remind\r\nus of another way of developing our power. Perhaps we can, once again,\r\nlook for and call for authentic dialogue with our patients, our\r\nstudents, and our colleagues. Paterson and Zderad are clear in their\r\nmethod: discuss, question, convey, clarify, argue, and reflect. They\r\nremind us of our uniqueness and our commonality. They tell us that it is\r\nnecessary to do with and be with each other in order for any one of us\r\nto grow. They help us celebrate the power of our choices.\r\n\r\nIs it ironic and fortunate that _Humanistic Nursing_ should be re-issued\r\nnow when it is needed even more than it was during the late 1970s? Then,\r\nhumanitarianism was in vogue. Now, it is under attack as a secular\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nToday, the technocratic imperative infiltrates an ever-increasing number\r\nof our lived experiences; and it becomes more difficult to ignore or\r\ndismiss Habermas's analysis that all interests have become technical\r\nrather than human.[6] As health care becomes increasingly commercial the\r\nprofound experiences of living and dying are discussed in terms of\r\nprofit and loss. Life itself is the focus of public debates about\r\nwhether surrogacy involves a whole baby being bought and sold or only\r\nhalf of a baby, since one half already \"belongs\" to the natural father\r\nand so he cannot buy what he already owns.\r\n\r\nWe have many choices before us: to adopt the values of commerce and\r\nredesign health care systems accordingly; to accept competition as the\r\nmodus operandi or insist on other measures for people in need; to decide\r\nwho will be cared for, who won't, who will pay, and how much?\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is time for us to turn away from the exchange between buyers\r\nand sellers, providers and consumers; and turn back to an exchange\r\nbetween two people trying to understand the space they share. Perhaps it\r\nis time for a shared dialogue with patients for whom the questions are\r\nmost vital? Perhaps we need to hear their call and respond\r\nauthentically. Perhaps they need to hear ours? For only then, as\r\nPaterson and Zderad have made quite clear, will our lived experiences in\r\nhealth care have any real meaning.\r\n\r\n    Patricia Moccia PHD, RN\r\n    Associate Professor and Chair\r\n    Department of Nursing Education\r\n    Teachers College Columbia University\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _Azanian Freedom Song._ Lyrics by Otis Williams, music by Bernice\r\nJohnson Reagon.

Then, they reflect on the experience and phenomenologically\r\ndescribe the calls they receive, their responses, and what they come to\r\nknow from their presence in the nursing situation. It is believed that\r\ncompilation and complementary syntheses of these phenomenological\r\ndescriptions over time will build and make explicit a science of\r\nnursing.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUMANISTIC NURSING: ITS MEANING\r\n\r\nNursing is an experience lived between human beings. Each nursing\r\nsituation reciprocally evokes and affects the expression and\r\nmanifestations of these human beings' capacity for and condition of\r\nexistence. In a nurse this implies a responsibility for the condition of\r\nherself or being. The term \"humanistic nursing\" was selected\r\nthoughtfully to designate this theoretical pursuit to reaffirm and\r\nfloodlight this responsible characteristic as fundamentally inherent to\r\nall artful-scientific nursing. Humanistic nursing embraces more than a\r\nbenevolent technically competent subject-object one-way relationship\r\nguided by a nurse in behalf of another. Rather it dictates that nursing\r\nis a responsible searching, transactional relationship whose\r\nmeaningfulness demands conceptualization founded on a nurse's\r\nexistential awareness of self and of the other. {4}\r\n\r\n\r\nEXISTENTIAL EXPERIENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nUniqueness--Otherness\r\n\r\nExistential experience infers human awareness of the self and of\r\notherness. It calls for a recognition of each man as existing singularly\r\nin-his-situation and struggling and striving with his fellows for\r\nsurvival and becoming, for confirmation of his existence and\r\nunderstanding of its meaning.\r\n\r\nMartin Buber, philosophical anthropologist and rabbi, expressed artfully\r\nthis uniqueness, struggle, and potential of each man. He said:\r\n\r\n     \"Sent forth from the natural domain of species into the hazard\r\n     of the solitary category, [man] surrounded by the air of a\r\n     chaos which came into being with him, secretly and bashfully he\r\n     watches for a Yes which allows him to be and which can come to\r\n     him only from one human person to another.\"[1]\r\n\r\nWith such uniqueness of each human being as a given, an assumed fact,\r\nonly each person can describe or choose the evolvement of the project\r\nwhich is himself-in-his situation. This awesome and lonely human\r\ncapacity for choice and novel evolvement presents both hope and fear as\r\nregards the unfolding of human \"moreness.\" Uniqueness is a universal\r\ncapacity of the human species. So, \"all-at-once,\" while each man is\r\nunique; paradoxically, he is also like his fellows. His very uniqueness\r\nis a characteristic of his commonality with all other men.\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthenticity--Experiencing\r\n\r\nIn humanistic nursing existential awareness calls for an authenticity\r\nwith one's self. As a visionary aim, such authenticity,\r\nself-in-touchness, is more than what usually is termed intellectual\r\nawareness. Auditory, olfactory, oral, visual, tactile, kinesthetic, and\r\nvisceral responses are involved and each can convey unique meaning to\r\nman's consciousness. In-touchness with these sensations and our\r\nresponses informs us about our quality of being, our thereness, our\r\ndegree of presence with others. The kind of \"between\" we live with\r\nothers depends on both our degree of awareness and the meaning we\r\nattribute to this awareness. This awareness, reflected on, sometimes\r\nshared with a responsible other for reality testing, offers us\r\nopportunity for broadening our meaning base, for becoming more--more in\r\naccord with our potential for humanness.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a statement made by Dr. Gene Phillips, professor of education at\r\nBoston University, will clarify the importance I attach to each nurse\r\nbecoming as much as she can be. He said, \"The more mature we are the\r\nless it is necessary for us to exclude.\" Presently I would paraphrase\r\nthis statement {5} and say, the more of ourselves we do not have to\r\nexclude, the more of the other we can be open to. Our self-awareness,\r\nin-touchness, self-acceptance, actualization of our potential allows us\r\nto share with others so they can become in relationship with us.\r\n\r\nIn this kind of existential relating, presence with another, a nurse is\r\nconfronted with man as singular in his own peculiar angular, biased, or\r\nshaded reality. It becomes apparent that each has his very own lived\r\nworld. So one might describe human existence as man-world as some refer\r\nto man as mind-body, using a hyphen rather than \"and.\" Man's universal\r\nspecies commonality and peculiar perplexing noncommonality, has this\r\nmanness, affect and constantly interplay with one another. This arena of\r\ninterplay is complicated further by man's capacity for nondeterminedness,\r\nhis ability for envisioning and considering a variety of alternatives\r\nand choosing selectively. Often these alternatives are experienced as\r\ncontradictory and inconsistent. Humanistic nursing calls forth in the\r\nnurse the struggle of recognizing the complexity of men's relating in\r\nthe nursing world as \"just how man is\" and his nature, his human\r\ncondition, as searching, experiencing, and an unfolding becoming.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreness--Choice\r\n\r\nHow can a nurse let herself know her human responses and the breadth and\r\ndepth of the possibilities called forth by the other? How can she be,\r\nsearch, experience, become in an accord with the calls and responses of\r\nher lived nursing world? It is a chosen, deliberate life-long process.\r\nThe process itself is generative. One experience opens the door for the\r\nnext. In humanistic nursing practice theory we call this kind of\r\nexperiencing authentic, genuine, or \"letting be what is.\" It is man\r\nconscious of himself, not necessarily acting out, but aware of his human\r\nresponses to his world and their meanings to him. This quality of\r\npersonal authenticity allows one's responsible chosen actions to be\r\nbased in human knowledge rather than human defensiveness. Man is a\r\nknowing place. From education and living experience one assumes an\r\ninitial innate force in human beingness that moves man to come to know\r\nhis own and others' angular views of the world. Humanistic nursing is\r\nconcerned with these angular views, these differences being viewed by\r\nnurses responsibly and as realities that are beyond the\r\nnegative-positive, good-evil standard of judgement. Or, for example,\r\nnursing is concerned with how this particular man, with his particular\r\nhistory, experiences being labeled with this general diagnosis and being\r\nadmitted, discharged, and living out his life with his condition as he\r\nviews it in-his-world.\r\n\r\nMan has the inherent capacity to respond to other man as other man. Only\r\neach unique nurse faced with the chaos of her alternatives in a\r\nsituation can then choose either to relate or not to relate and how to\r\nrelate in-her-nursing-world to others. Choosing to and how to relate or\r\nrespond cannot be superimposed on man from the outside by another. A\r\nperson, to a degree, can be coerced to behave outwardly in a certain\r\nway. For example, physically, in a spatial {6} sense, a nurse can be\r\nordered into parallel existence with another. Being existentially and\r\ngenuinely present with another is different. This human mode of being is\r\nchosen and controlled by the self. It takes responsible self-ordering\r\nthat can arise only in the spirit of one's own disciplined being.\r\n\r\n\r\nValue--Nonvalue\r\n\r\nTo offer genuine presence to others, a belief must exist within a person\r\nthat such presence is of value and makes a difference in a situation. If\r\nit is a value for a nurse, it will be offered in her nursing situation.\r\nLibraries, concrete buildings bursting with words of great thinkers,\r\nsupport the value of genuine presence and authentic dialogue between\r\npersons. Consider the literary works that have conveyed or reflected\r\nthis message throughout the existence of intellectual man. Plato,\r\nRousseau, Goethe, Proust, Nietzsche, Whitehead, Jung, May, Frankl,\r\nHesse, de Chardin, Bergson, Marcel and Buber effortlessly come to mind.\r\n\r\nMany nurses are genuine presences in the nursing situation. Some have\r\ntried to share their experiences; some have not. And, there are those\r\nwho are not genuine presences in the nursing situation. One wonders if\r\nthis has influenced the distinctions nurses have made over the years\r\nwith certainty when considering their nurse contemporaries. Often one\r\nhears, \"she is a good nurse, a natural.\" These positive critics are\r\noften up against it when asked, \"why, how, what?\" Descriptive literary\r\nconceptualizations of nursing that reflect this quality of nurse-being\r\n(presence, intersubjectiveness) call for nurses willing to search out\r\nand bring to awareness, the mysteries of their commonplace, their\r\nfamiliar, and to appreciate the unique ideas, values, and meanings\r\nfundamental to their practice. Conceptualization of these qualities by\r\npracticing nurses is basic and necessary to the development of a science\r\nand an actualized profession of nursing.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHENOMENOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nPhenomenology directs us to the study of the \"thing itself.\" The\r\nexistential literature, descriptions of what man has come to know and\r\nunderstand in his experience, has evolved from the use of the\r\nphenomenological approach. In the humanistic nursing practice theory the\r\n\"thing itself\" is the existentially experienced nursing situation. Both\r\nphenomenology and existentialism value experience, man's capacities for\r\nsurprise and knowing, and honor the evolving of the \"new.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Does Humanistic Nursing Practice Theory Ask the Nurse to Describe?\r\n\r\nNurses experience with other human beings peak life events: creation,\r\nbirth, winning, nothingness, losing, separation, death. Their \"I-Thou\"\r\nempathetic {7} relations with persons during these actual lived\r\nexperiences and their own experiential-educational histories make \"the\r\nbetween\" of the nursing situation unique. Through in-touchness with\r\nself, authentic awareness and reflection on such experiences the human\r\nnurse comes to know. Humanistic nursing practice theory asks that the\r\nnurse describe what she comes to know: (1) the nurse's unique\r\nperspective and responses, (2) the other's knowable responses, and (3)\r\nthe reciprocal call and response, the between, as they occur in the\r\nnursing situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Does Humanistic Nursing Practice Theory Ask That Existential Nursing\r\nExperience Be Described Phenomenologically?\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons. Philosophically and fundamentally the reason\r\nrelates to how humanistic nursing perceives the purpose and aim of\r\nnursing. It views nursing as the ability to struggle with other man\r\nthrough peak experiences related to health and suffering in which the\r\nparticipants in the nursing situation are and become in accordance with\r\ntheir human potential. So, like Elie Wiesel, the novelist, who states in\r\n_One Generation After_ that he writes to attest to events of human\r\nexistence and to come to understand, humanistic nursing proposes that\r\nhuman forms of existence in nursing situations need attestation and that\r\nthrough describing, nurses will understand better and relate to man as\r\nman is. Thus the profession of nursing's service contribution to the\r\ncommunity of man will ever become more.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for phenomenologically describing nursing are complex,\r\ninterinfluential, and their ramifications are far reaching.\r\nSequentially, the study and description of human phenomena presented in\r\nnursing situations will affect (1) the quality of the nursing situation,\r\n(2) man's general knowledge of the variation in human capacity for\r\nbeingness, and (3) the development and form of the evolvement of nursing\r\ntheory and science.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Can Nurses Begin to Describe Humanistic Nursing Phenomenologically?\r\n\r\nThe process of how to describe nursing events entails deliberate\r\nresponsible, conscious, aware, nonjudgmental existence of the nurse in\r\nthe nursing situation followed by disciplined authentic reflection and\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nThere are obvious common lived human experiences which if considered and\r\nwondered about, can advance a nurse's ability for phenomenological\r\ndescription. These experiences are easily cited, yet not easily plumbed.\r\nOften experiences such as anger, frustration, waiting, apathy,\r\nconfusion, perplexity, questioning, surprise, conflict, headache,\r\ncrying, laughing, joy are quickly theoretically and analytically\r\ninterpreted, labeled, and dismissed. Examining, reexamining, mulling\r\nover, brooding on, and fussing with the situational context of these\r\nexperiences as nonlabeled, raw human lived data can yield {8}\r\nknowledge. Knowledge of the nurse's and her other's unique human\r\nexistence in their on-going struggle becomes explicit. Superficial\r\ntreatment of such human clues results in nonfulfillment of the realistic\r\nhuman possibilities of artful-scientific professional knowing and\r\nnursing.\r\n\r\nWords are the major tools of phenomenological description. They are\r\nlimited by our human ability to express, and yet they are the best tools\r\nwe have for expressing the human condition. The novelist James Agee, in\r\n_Let Us Now Praise Famous Men_, says that though man or human\r\nrelatedness never could be described perfectly it would be the greater\r\ncrime not to try. This, too, is a basic premise of the humanistic\r\nnursing practice theory.\r\n\r\nThe words we use to describe and discuss this theory are easy words,\r\neveryday English words. We all know them. We, at times, narrow a word's\r\nmeaning or make it more specific. Some problem is presented by words we\r\nare accustomed to using and hearing. Habit and our human fallibility can\r\npromote only superficial comprehension. Thoughtful awareness of the\r\nmeaning of these same sequentially expressed words can convey the\r\ncomplexity of the never completely fathomable \"all-at-onceness\" of lived\r\nexistence. This theory is expressed in terms like \"existence\r\nconfirming,\" \"striving,\" \"becoming,\" \"relation,\" and \"reflection.\" We\r\nintend such words to express the grasp with acceptance and recognition\r\nof human limitations while awesomely pondering the open-ended scope of\r\neach man's potential.\r\n\r\nIn time, with disciplined authentic reflective description, themes\r\ncommon and significant to nursing situations become apparent. They are\r\nthen available for compilation, complementary synthesis, and on-going\r\nrefinement. A nursing resource bank accrues: Not a bank that offers a\r\nmap of how and what to do but rather one that further stimulates nurses'\r\nexploration and understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EVOLVEMENT OF HUMANISTIC NURSING PRACTICE THEORY\r\n\r\nSince 1960 Loretta T. Zderad and myself in dialogue, together, and with\r\ngroups of nurses in graduate schools and in nursing service situations\r\nhave reflected on, explored, and questioned our own and others' nursing\r\nsituational experiences. Over this period we have come to value and\r\nappreciate the meaningfulness of these situations to man's existence.\r\nThis constantly augmented our feelings of responsibility for\r\ncontributing to these situations beneficially. Therefore, we looked at\r\nthem for their tractability to research methodology. Their loadedness\r\nwith variations, changes, uncontrollables, and our negative feelings\r\nabout the implications of viewing human beings as predictable left the\r\nstrict scientism of positivistic method wanting at this stage of man's\r\nknowing. We saw objectivity in nursing situations or our questions,\r\nnursing questions, in the realm of needing to now how man experienced\r\nhis existence. This objectivity, or man's real lived reality\r\nparadoxically is subjectively ridden, man-world.\r\n\r\nThe existential literature dealt with substantive themes encountered in\r\nnursing experiences. As I previously stated this literature evolves from\r\na phenomenological {9} approach to studying being and existence. This\r\napproach to studying, describing, and developing an artistic science of\r\nnursing became Dr. Zderad's and my long-sought haven. All along\r\nexistentialism and phenomenology had been ours 'and many nurses' \"what\"\r\nand \"how.\" Now we had labels that were acceptable and reputable to\r\nmany--most of all to ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Martin Buber, \"Distance and Relation,\" trans. Ronald Gregor Smith,\r\nin _The Knowledge of Man_, ed.

It comes into being under\r\ncertain conditions--one human being needs a kind of help and another\r\ngives it. The meaning of nursing as a living human act is in the act\r\nitself. To understand it, therefore, it is necessary to consider nursing\r\nas an existent, a phenomenon occurring in the real world.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHENOMENON OF NURSING\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of nursing appears in many forms in the real lived world.\r\nIt varies with the age of the patient, the pathology or disability, the\r\nkind and degree of help needed, the duration of the need for help, the\r\npatient's location and his potential for obtaining and using help, and\r\nthe nurse's perception of the need and her capacities for responding to\r\nit. Nursing varies also in relation to the sociocultural context in\r\nwhich it occurs. Being one element in an evolving complex system of\r\nhealth care, nursing is continuously appearing in new specialized forms.\r\nAs professionals, we are accustomed to viewing nursing as we practice it\r\nwithin these specialty contexts--for example, pediatric, medical,\r\nrehabilitation, intensive care, long-term care, community. There seems\r\nto be no end to the proliferation of diversifications. Even the attempts\r\nof practitioners to combine specialties give rise to new specialties,\r\nsuch as, community mental health nursing and child psychiatric nursing.\r\n\r\nSo it is difficult to focus on the phenomenon of nursing as an entity\r\nwithout having one's view colored by a particular clinical, functional,\r\nor societal context. Yet, if we can \"bracket\" (hold in abeyance) these\r\nadjectival labels and the preconceived viewpoints they signify, we can\r\nconsider the thing itself, the act of nursing in its most simple and\r\ngeneral appearance. {12}\r\n\r\n\r\nWell-Being and More-Being\r\n\r\nIn this most basic sense, then, disregarding the particular specialized\r\nforms in which it appears, the nursing act always is related to the\r\nhealth-illness quality of the human condition, or fundamentally, to a\r\nman's personal survival. This is not to say that all instances of\r\nnursing are matters of life and death, but rather that every nursing act\r\nhas to do with the quality of a person's living and dying.\r\n\r\nThat nursing is related to health and illness is self-evident. How it is\r\nrelated is not so apparent. \"Health\" is valued as necessary for survival\r\nand is often proposed as the goal of nursing. There are, in actuality,\r\nmany instances of nursing that could be described as \"health restoring,\"\r\n\"health sustaining,\" or \"health promoting.\" Nurses engage in \"health\r\nteaching\" and \"health supervision.\" On the other hand, there are\r\ninstances in which health, taken in its narrowest meaning as freedom\r\nfrom disease, is not seen as an attainable goal, as evidenced, for\r\nexample, in labels given to patients such as \"terminal,\" \"hopeless,\" and\r\n\"chronic.\" Yet in actual practice these humans' conditions call forth\r\nsome of the most complete, expert, total, beautiful nursing care.\r\nNursing, then, as a human response, implies the valuing of some human\r\npotential beyond the narrow concept of health taken as absence of\r\ndisease. Nursing's concern is not merely with a person's well-being but\r\nwith his more-being, with helping him become more as humanly possible in\r\nhis particular life situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nHuman Potential\r\n\r\nSince nursing involves one human being helping another, the notion of\r\nhumaneness has been associated traditionally with nursing. Nursing\r\npractice is criticized justifiably when it is not humane and is taken\r\nfor granted or praised when it is. The expectation of humaneness is so\r\ningrained in the concept of nursing that some nurses are surprised when\r\nit is acknowledged by patients. If a patient thanks them for their\r\nkindness, patience, or concern, these nurses reply, in their\r\nembarrassment, \"Oh, that's part of my job.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, to equate nursing's humanistic character solely with an\r\noverflowing of the milk of human kindness is a serious error of\r\noversimplification. Such a limited view, in fact, is a dehumanizing\r\ndenial of man's potentials. As a human transaction, the phenomenon of\r\nnursing contains all the human potentials and limitations of each unique\r\nparticipant. For instance, frustration, discouragement, anger,\r\nrejection, withdrawal, loneliness, aggression, impatience, envy, grief,\r\ndespair, pain, and suffering are constituents of nursing, as well as\r\ntenderness, caring, courage, trust, joy, hope. In other words, since\r\nnursing is lived by humans, the \"stuff\" of nursing includes all possible\r\nresponses of man--man needing and man helping--in his situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntersubjective Transaction\r\n\r\nLooking again at the phenomenon of nursing as it occurs in the real\r\nlived world, obviously it is always an interhuman event. Whenever\r\nnursing takes {13} place two (or more) human beings are related in a\r\nshared situation. Each participates according to his own mode of being\r\nin the situation, that is, as a person nursing or as a person begin\r\nnursed. Since one is nursing and the other is being nursed, it follows\r\nthat the essential character of the situation is \"nurturance.\" In other\r\nwords, the phenomenon of nursing involves nurturing, being nurtured, and\r\na relation--the \"between\" in which or through which the nurturance\r\noccurs.\r\n\r\nOn reflection, it is obvious that nursing is an intersubjective\r\ntransaction. Both persons, nurse and patient (client, family, group),\r\nnecessarily participate in the proceedings. In this sense, they are\r\n_inter_dependent. Yet, they are both subjects, that is, each is the\r\noriginator of human acts and of human responses to the other. In this\r\nsense, they are _in_dependent. The intersubjective transactional\r\ncharacter of nursing cannot be escaped when one is experiencing the\r\nphenomenon, either as nurse or as patient. Consider for example, some of\r\nthe most common nursing activities, such as, feeding and being fed,\r\ncomforting and being comforted, giving and taking medications. Although\r\nthis intersubjectivity is unmistakably known in experience, it is\r\nextremely difficult to conceptualize and convey it to others. It rarely\r\nis found in descriptions of nursing, and to the unfortunate extent that\r\nit is missing, the descriptions are not true to life.\r\n\r\nIn real life, nursing phenomena may be experienced from the reference\r\npoints of nurturing, of being nurtured, or of the nurturing process in\r\nthe \"between.\" For instance, the nurse may describe comfort as an\r\nexperience of comforting another person; the patient, as an experience\r\nof being comforted. However, while each has experienced something within\r\nhimself, he also has experienced something of the \"between,\" namely, the\r\nmessage or meaning of the \"comforting-being comforted\" process. This\r\nessential interhuman dimension of nursing is beyond and yet within the\r\ntechnical, procedural, or interactional elements of the event. It is a\r\nquality of being that is expressed in the doing.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing and Doing\r\n\r\nAs an intersubjective, transactional experience, nursing necessarily\r\ninvolves both a mode of being and a doing of something. The being and\r\ndoing are interrelated so inextricably that it is difficult, even\r\ndistorting, to speak of one without the other. Descriptions of nursing,\r\nhowever, often focus primarily (sometimes exclusively) on the doing\r\naspect of the process, on the nursing techniques or procedures. The\r\nobservable acts are more easily discerned and discussed. They can be\r\nmeasured, counted, and charted. Yet, in the actual interhuman experience\r\nof nursing the weight of being is felt. Presence and the effect of one's\r\npresence can be known much more vividly than they can be described.\r\nStill, not to attempt to describe them is to present only a half, or\r\nperhaps less than half, of the nursing picture.\r\n\r\nWhen a nurse refers to a nurse-patient interaction during which a change\r\nin the patient's condition or behavior was noted, one hoping to get a\r\ndescription of nursing may ask, \"What did you do?\" Often the answer is a\r\ndescription of a {14} manual action or a verbal interchange. Sometimes\r\nthe nurse responds, \"Nothing, I was just there.\" Perhaps it is the\r\nquestion that is wrong. The respondent usually interprets \"doing\" in a\r\nlimited sense. In reality, everything the nurse does is colored by the\r\ncharacter of her being in the situation. The nursing act itself is a\r\nbehavioral expression of the nurse's state of being, for example,\r\nconcerned, fatigued, hurried, confident, hopeless.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there is a kind of being, a \"being with\" or a \"being\r\nthere,\" that is really a kind of doing for it involves the nurse's\r\nactive presence. To \"be with\" in this fuller sense requires turning\r\none's attention toward the patient, being aware of and open to the here\r\nand now shared situation, and communicating one's availability.\r\n\r\nWhether the nursing act is verbal, or manual, or both, a silent glance,\r\nor physical presence, some degree of intersubjectivity is involved and\r\nwarrants recognition. To become more aware of and explore more fully\r\nthis essential constituent of nursing we need to focus on the\r\nparticipants' modes of being in the situation. Rather than ask the\r\nnurse, \"What did you do in the nurse-patient situation?\" we ought to\r\nask, \"What happened between you?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHUMANISTIC NURSING\r\n\r\nWhen the meaning of nursing is sought by scrutinizing the phenomenon,\r\nthat is, by examining the nursing event itself as it occurs in real\r\nlife, one finds nursing embedded within the human context. As a\r\nnurturing response of one person to another in need, it aims at the\r\ndevelopment of human potential, at well-being and more-being. As\r\nsomething that happens between people, it reflects all the human\r\npotential and limitations of the persons involved. As an intersubjective\r\ntransaction, it holds the possibility for both persons to effect and be\r\naffected, the possibility for both to become more. At its very base,\r\nthen, nursing is humanistic. It is, at once, man's expression of and his\r\nstriving for survival and further development in community.\r\n\r\nIn a way, to specify nursing as humanistic seems redundant. In view of\r\nits source and goals how could it be otherwise? However, the term\r\n\"humanistic nursing\" was coined thoughtfully and used purposely here to\r\ndesignate a particular nursing approach. Not only does the term signify\r\nfull recognition of nursing's human foundation and meaning but it also\r\npoints the direction for nursing's necessary development. What is\r\nproposed here is the enrichment of nursing by exploring and expanding\r\nits relations to its human context.\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthentic Commitment\r\n\r\nWhen it is genuinely humanistic, nursing is an expression, a living out,\r\nof the nurse's authentic commitment. It is an existential engagement\r\ndirected toward nurturing human potential. The humanistic nurse values\r\nnursing as a situation in which the necessary conditions for such human\r\nactualization exist and is open to the possibilities in the intimately\r\nshared nurse-patient here and now. {15}\r\n\r\nHumanistic nursing calls for an existential involvement, that is, an\r\nactive presence with the whole of the nurse's being. This involved\r\npresence is personal and professional. It is personal--a live act\r\nstemming from this unique, individual nurse. It is a chosen human\r\nresponse freely given; it cannot be assigned or programmed. The\r\ninvolvement is professional--goal directed. It is based on an\r\nart-science; it is held accountable.\r\n\r\nAnyone familiar with typical hectic nursing situations could justifiably\r\nquestion the actual attainability of such an existential involvement. It\r\ngoes without saying that it would be humanly impossible for a nurse to\r\nbe wholly present to numerous patients for eight hours a day. But any\r\nnurse who has experienced moments of genuine presence in the\r\nnurse-patient situation will attest to their reality and to the fact\r\nthat it is these beautiful moments that give meaning to nursing. In\r\nterms of actual practice, then, it is more realistic to think of\r\nhumanistic nursing as occurring in various degrees. It may be more\r\nuseful, in fact, to consider humanistic nursing a goal worth striving\r\nfor; or an attitude that strengthens one's perseverance toward attaining\r\nthe difficult goal; or fundamentally, a major value shaping one's\r\nnursing practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nProcess--Choice and Intersubjectivity\r\n\r\nFor the process of nursing to be truly humanistic it must bear out, that\r\nis, be a lived expression of, the nurse's recognition and valuing of\r\nnursing as an opportunity for the development of the human person. To\r\nthis end, humanistic nursing process echoes existential themes related\r\nto a person's becoming through choice and intersubjectivity.\r\n\r\nExistentially speaking, man is his choices. This does not mean that a\r\nman can be anything he chooses. Naturally, each individual is unique,\r\nhaving his own particular potentials and limitations. Nor is this view a\r\ndenial of the forces of unconscious motivation and habit. It does not\r\nimply that all of a person's actions result from totally conscious\r\ndeliberations. By saying, \"I am my choices,\" I mean I am this here and\r\nnow person because in my past life I took particular paths in preference\r\nto others; of the possibilities open to me, I actualized certain ones.\r\n\r\nIn this sense, I am my history, I am what I am, what I have become. But\r\nI am also what I am not, what I have not become. I am a nurse, this\r\nunique here and now nurse with particular experience, knowledge, skills,\r\nand values; without other experience, knowledge, skills, and values.\r\nThrough self-reflection I know that I have changed, I have experienced\r\ngrowth from within. I know myself as a being capable of becoming more,\r\ncapable of actualizing my possibilities, my self. So I am my choices not\r\nonly in terms of my past but also in regard to my future, my\r\npossibilities.\r\n\r\nMan is an individual being necessarily related to other men in time and\r\nspace. As every man is beholden to other men for his birth and\r\ndevelopment, interdependence is inherent in the human situation. In this\r\nsense, human existence is coexistence. The deeper significance of this\r\ntruth has been recognized and elucidated by many thinkers, especially\r\nthose in the existential stream. Over {16} and over, their writings\r\nreveal the paradoxical tension of being human: each man is, at once,\r\nindependent, a unique individual and interdependent, a necessarily\r\nrelated being. As Wilfrid Desan says, referring to man as subsistent\r\nrelation, \"He is towards-the-other but he is not-the-other.\"[1]\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as Martin Buber and Gabriel Marcel maintain, it is actually\r\nthrough his relations with other men that a man becomes, that his unique\r\nindividuality is actualized. To know myself as \"individual\" is to\r\nexperience myself as this particular unique here-and-now person and\r\nother than that there-and-now person. Or in other words, to know myself\r\nas me is to see myself in relation to and distant from other selves. As\r\nBuber so beautifully states, \"It is from one man to another that the\r\nheavenly bread of self-being is passed.\"[2]\r\n\r\nLogically, it follows that the possibility for self-confirmation exists\r\nin any intersubjective situation. However, in everyday life this\r\nself-confirmation is experienced to different degrees or on different\r\nlevels in interhuman relating. Since both persons are independent\r\nsubjects acting with their human capacity for disclosing or enclosing\r\nthemselves, there is no guarantee that the availability and presence\r\nnecessary for a genuine confirming encounter will come forth. Presence,\r\nthe gift of one's self, cannot be seized or called forth by demand, it\r\ncan only be given freely and be invoked or evoked.\r\n\r\nSince man becomes more through his choices and the aim of nursing is to\r\nhelp man toward well-being or more-being, the humanistic nursing effort\r\nis directed toward increasing the possibilities of making responsible\r\nchoices. Such choice involves, in the first place, an openness to and an\r\nawareness of one's own situation. A choice is a response to possibility.\r\nTherefore, one must first recognize that possibilities or alternatives\r\nexist. This openness to options is experienced as a freedom to choose as\r\nwell as a freedom from the bonds of habit and stereotyped response, from\r\nroutine, from the veils of the obvious. It means getting in touch with\r\none's experience, one's subjective-objective world. As one becomes more\r\nacutely aware of his personal freedom of choice, there arises\r\nconcurrently an awareness of the quality of choice, of the\r\nresponsibility that is always implied in the freedom. Then follows\r\nreflective consideration of one's unique situation with its possible\r\nalternatives and an examination of the values inherent in them. Finally,\r\nthe act of choosing is expressed in a response to the situation with a\r\nwillingness to accept the responsibility for its foreseeable\r\nconsequences. Through this experience the person becomes aware of\r\nhimself as an individual. As a subject choosing freely and responsibly,\r\nhe knows himself as distinct from and yet related to others.\r\n\r\nNursing, being an intersubjective transaction, presents an occasion for\r\nboth persons, patient and nurse, to experience the process of making\r\nresponsible choices. Through living this process in nursing situations,\r\nthe nurse develops her own potential for responsible choosing. The\r\nsatisfaction, often in the form {17} of a sense of vitality and\r\nstrength, that is felt in making responsible competent professional\r\njudgments reinforces the habit. In personally coming to experientially\r\nappreciate the growth promoting character of responsible choosing, the\r\nnurse may more readily recognize the value of such experiences for any\r\nperson, including the one currently labeled \"patient.\" The humanistic\r\nnurse, therefore, is alert to opportunities for the patient to exercise\r\nhis freedom of choice within the limits of safe and sound practice. She\r\nis constantly assessing his capabilities and needs and encourages his\r\nmaximum participation in his own health care program. Through\r\ncoexperiencing and supporting the process in the patient's experience\r\nfrom his point of view, the nurse nurtures his human potential for\r\nresponsible choosing. Both patient and nurse become more through making\r\nresponsible choices in the intersubjective, transactional nursing\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheory and Practice\r\n\r\nThe term \"humanistic nursing\" refers to a kind of nursing practice and\r\nits theoretical foundations. The two are so interrelated that it is\r\ndifficult, in fact even somewhat distorting, to speak exclusively of\r\neither the practice or the theory of humanistic nursing. When, for the\r\nsake of clarity or emphasis, discussion is focused on either the\r\npractical or the theoretical realm, thoughts of the other realm cast\r\ntheir shadows on the fringes. For in our view, for the process of\r\nnursing to be truly humanistic means that the nurse is involved as an\r\nexperiencing, valuing, reflecting, conceptualizing human person. From\r\nthe other side, the theory of humanistic nursing is derived from actual\r\npractice, that is, from being with and doing with the patient. \"Theory,\"\r\nsays R. D. Laing, \"is the articulated vision of experience.\"[3]\r\n\r\nHumanistic nursing is not a matter solely of doing but also of being.\r\nThe humanistic nurse is open to the reality of the situation in the\r\nexistential sense. She is available with her total being in the\r\nnurse-patient situation. This involves a living out of the nurturing,\r\nintersubjective transaction with all of one's human capacities which\r\ninclude a response to the experienced reality. Man is able to set his\r\nworld at a distance as an independent opposite and enter into relation\r\nwith it. In fact, according to Buber, this is what distinguishes\r\nexistence as human. It is man's special way of being.[4] For nursing to\r\nbe humanistic in this full sense of the term requires being and doing in\r\nthe situation and subsequently setting the experienced reality at a\r\ndistance (that is, objectifying it) and entering into relation with it.\r\nThe nurse's reflective response to her lived world may take the shape of\r\nany form of human dialogue with reality, such as, science, art, or\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\nViewed existentially, every nursing event is unique, a live\r\nintersubjective transaction colored and formed by the individual\r\nparticipants. Although the event is ephemeral, the resultant\r\nexperiential knowledge is lasting and cumulative. So {18} from the\r\nnurse's daily commonplace grows a body of clinical wisdom. The need for\r\ndescribing nursing phenomena, for expressing and conceptualizing lived\r\nnursing worlds, is basic to the theoretical and actual development of\r\nhumanistic nursing. In summary, we contend that humanistic nursing\r\npractice necessarily involves the conceptualization of that practice and\r\nan examination of its inherent values and that humanistic nursing theory\r\nmust be derived from nurses' lived experience. The interwoven theory and\r\npractice are reciprocally enlightening.\r\n\r\n\r\nFramework--The Human Situation\r\n\r\nIt is easy to recognize the intrinsic interrelatedness of humanistic\r\nnursing theory and practice and the consequent necessity for their\r\nconcurrent development. It is even quite easy to take the next steps of\r\nvaluing such development and committing oneself to the task. But then\r\nthe question arises: Where to begin?\r\n\r\nHumanistic nursing is concerned with what is basically nursing, that is,\r\nwith the phenomenon of nursing wherever it occurs regardless of its\r\nspecialized clinical, functional, or sociocultural form. So its domain\r\nincludes any or all nursing situations. And within this domain, since\r\nhumanistic nursing is an intersubjective transaction aimed at nurturing\r\nwell-being and more-being, its \"stuff\" includes all possible human and\r\ninterhuman responses. To conceive of so limitless a universe for study\r\nis at once exhilarating and overwhelming. How can one get a handle on\r\nthe nursing universe? Is it possible to envision an inclusive frame that\r\nwould allow an orderly, systematic, and hopefully productive approach to\r\nthe development of humanistic nursing?\r\n\r\nThe key is to return again to the source, to look at the phenomenon of\r\nnursing as it occurs in real life. From this perspective, the human\r\nsituation sets the stage where nursing is lived. The major dimensions of\r\nhumanistic nursing, then, may be derived from this situation.\r\nExistentially, man is an incarnate being always becoming in relation\r\nwith men and things in a world of time and space. The nursing situation\r\nis a particular kind of human situation in which the interhuman relating\r\nis purposely directed toward nurturing the well-being or more-being of a\r\nperson with perceived needs related to the health-illness quality of\r\nliving. The elements of the frame, based on this view of humanistic\r\nnursing, would include incarnate men (patient and nurse) meeting (being\r\nand becoming) in a goal directed (nurturing well-being and more-being)\r\nintersubjective transaction (being with and doing with) occurring in\r\ntime and space (measured and as lived by patient and nurse) in a world\r\nof men and things. In other words, the inexhaustible richness of lived\r\nnursing worlds could be explored freely, imaginatively, and creatively\r\nin any direction suggested by the dimensions of this open framework. It\r\nallows for a variety of angular views.\r\n\r\nFor example, in terms of man as incarnate, it is certainly not new for\r\nnurses to focus on man's bodily existence. Naturally, one of nursing's\r\nbasic concerns always has been care of people's physical needs. To view\r\nnursing from the perspective of the human situation, however, is to see\r\nbeyond physical care, {19} beyond the categorization of man as a\r\nbiopsychosocial organism. The focus is on the person's unique being and\r\nbecoming in his situation.\r\n\r\nEvery man is inserted into the common world of men and things through\r\nhis own unique body. Through it he affects the world and the world\r\naffects him. Through it he develops his own unique personal private\r\nworld. When a person's bodily functions change during illness _the_\r\nworld and _his_ world change for him. The nurse needs to consider how\r\nthe patient experiences his lived world. Ordinary things which nurses\r\nsimply take for granted, such as, hospital noises or odors, touching,\r\nbathing, feeding, sleep or meal schedules, may have very different\r\nmeaning for individual patients. They may or may not be experienced as\r\nnurturing in a particular person's lived world.\r\n\r\nIn the humanistic perspective the nurse also is viewed as a human\r\nperson, as a being in a body rather than merely as a function or a doer\r\nof activities. Conscious recognition of this fact opens many areas for\r\nexploration. Obviously, the nurse's actions (her being with and doing\r\nwith), that affect the patient's world, are expressed through her body.\r\nHow is nurturance communicated and actually effected through nursing\r\nactivities? From the other side, consider the nurse as being affected by\r\nthe world through her body. What depths of \"nursing content\" could we\r\nfathom if we accepted the existential dictum that \"the body knows?\"\r\nWould we dismiss so lightly those gems of clinical wisdom nurses\r\nattribute disparagingly to \"gut reaction,\" \"unscientific intuition,\" or\r\n\"years of experience\"? Would we value serious exploration and extraction\r\nof these natural resources in the nursing world?\r\n\r\nThe framework suggests, further, the possibilities of exploring the\r\ndevelopment of human potential, both patient's and nurse's, as it occurs\r\nin the unique domain of nursing's intersubjective transactions. What\r\nhuman resources are called forth in the shared situations during which\r\nnurses coexperience and cosearch with patients the varied meanings of\r\nbeing and becoming over the entire range of life from birth to death?\r\nHow does it occur? What is the process? What promotes well-being or\r\nbecoming more when facing life, suffering, death? For the patient? For\r\nthe nurse? What knowledge gained through the study of nursing, a\r\nparticular form of the human situation, could be contributed to the\r\ngeneral body of human sciences?\r\n\r\nFinally, within this framework, all the phenomena experienced in the\r\nnursing situation could be explored in relation to their attributes of\r\ntime and space. More specifically, from an existential perspective, the\r\nfocus would be directed toward the significance of lived time and space,\r\nthat is, time and space as experienced by the patient and/or the nurse,\r\nand as shared intersubjectively. For example, waiting, silence,\r\nchronicity, emergency, positioning a patient in bed, moving through\r\nspace in a wheelchair, crutchwalking, pacing, could be considered from\r\nthe standpoint of the patient's experienced space and time, or from the\r\nnurse's, or as a shared event. Explorations of this kind could provide\r\nvaluable insights into important nursing phenomena, such as, presence,\r\nempathy, comfort, timing. {20}\r\n\r\nThe human situation, then, is the ground within which nursing takes\r\nform. As such, it provides a framework for approaching the study and\r\ndevelopment of humanistic nursing. As an angular view, it holds the\r\nfocus on the basic question underlying nursing practice: Is this\r\nparticular intersubjective, transactional nursing event humanizing or\r\ndehumanizing?\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThis chapter explored the foundations of humanistic nursing. The\r\ndiscussion flowed naturally, perhaps unavoidably, into the realm of\r\nmeta-nursing. \"Naturally,\" for the humanistic nursing approach is itself\r\nan outgrowth of the critical examination of nursing as an experienced\r\nphenomenon. From this existential perspective of nursing as a living\r\nhuman act, the meaning of nursing is found in the act itself, in\r\nnursing's relation to its human context.\r\n\r\nReflection on nursing as it is lived in the real world revealed its\r\nexistential, nurturing, intersubjective, transactional character. The\r\nprocess of humanistic nursing stemming from the nurse's authentic\r\ncommitment is a kind of being with and doing with. It aims at the\r\ndevelopment of human potential through inter subjectivity and\r\nresponsible choosing.\r\n\r\nThe actualization of humanistic nursing is dependent on the concurrent\r\ndevelopment of its practice and theoretical foundations by practicing\r\nnurses. An open framework derived from the human situation was offered\r\nto suggest possible dimensions of humanistic nursing practice that could\r\nbe described and articulated into a body of theory.\r\n\r\nNurses who have considered this humanistic nursing approach in terms of\r\ntheir daily practice have felt at home in the ideas. The\r\nconceptualizations fit their personal nursing experience. If there is\r\nany strangeness in the approach, it is perhaps that it does not follow\r\nthe contours of the clinical specialties to which we have grown so\r\naccustomed that they may be more ruts than roads. This is not to say\r\nthat humanistic nursing is opposed to clinical specialization in\r\nnursing. In fact, clinical nursing, as it exists in any form, is its\r\nvery heart and base. Humanistic nursing is not compartmentalized into\r\nclinical (or functional, or sociocultural) specialties because it\r\napplies in all clinical areas. It is, in the most basic sense,\r\ncross-clinical. This may be the great advantage of humanistic nursing.\r\nBy orienting its explorations ontologically, it may foster genuine\r\ncross-clinical studies of nursing phenomena. If nurses with highly\r\ndeveloped abilities in particular forms of nursing would struggle\r\ntogether in collaborative cross-clinical studies of nursing phenomena,\r\nspecialization would serve to advance rather than fragment all nursing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Wilfred Desan, _The Planetary Man_, Vol. I, _A Noetic Prelude to a\r\nUnited World_ (New York: The Macmillan Company, 1972). p. 37.\r\n\r\n[2] Martin Buber, \"Distance and Relation,\" trans.

Therefore, the interrelated practical and theoretical development\r\nof humanistic nursing is dependent on nurses experiencing,\r\nconceptualizing, and sharing their unique angular views of their unique\r\nlived nursing worlds. An open framework suggesting dimensions for such\r\nexploration was derived from a consideration of the phenomenon of\r\nnursing within its basic context, namely, the human situation. The\r\nelements of this humanistic nursing framework include incarnate men\r\n(patient and nurse) meeting (being and becoming) in a goal-directed\r\n(nurturing well-being and more-being), intersubjective transaction\r\n(being with and doing with) occurring in time and space (as measured and\r\nas lived by patient and nurse) in a world of men and things.\r\n\r\nThe framework offers a little security by providing some reference\r\npoints for the exploration. However, what is gained in clarity by\r\nconceptual abstraction is lost from the flavor of the actual experience.\r\nLike a weather map that statically represents major factors and currents\r\nin their interrelatedness, the framework discloses a nexus of elements.\r\nBut it is as far from the real phenomenon of nursing with its pains and\r\nsuffering and comforting and joys and hopes as the weather map is from\r\nreal weather with its wind and rain and heat and cold. This chapter is\r\nconcerned with the same basic framework of humanistic nursing but seen\r\nin an enlivened form. To inspirit its constructs the search must return\r\nagain to the existential source, to the nursing situation as it is\r\nlived.\r\n\r\nWhen I reflect on an act of mine (no matter how simple or complex) that\r\nI can unhesitatingly label \"nursing,\" I become aware of it as\r\ngoal-directed (nurturing) being with and doing with another. The\r\nintersubjective or interhuman element, \"the between,\" runs through\r\nnursing interactions like an underground stream conveying the nutrients\r\nof healing and growth. In everyday practice, we are usually so involved\r\nwith the immediate demands of our \"being with and {22} doing with\" the\r\npatient that we do not focus on the overshadowed plane of \"the between.\"\r\nHowever, occasionally, in beautiful moments, the interhuman currents are\r\nso strong that they flood our conscious awareness. Such rare and\r\nrewarding moments of mutual presence remind us of the elusive\r\never-present \"between.\"\r\n\r\n>From these epiphanic episodes in our personal nursing experience, we\r\nhave certain and immediate knowledge of intersubjectivity. Through our\r\nexperience, too, we know that both humanizing and dehumanizing effects\r\ncan result from human interactions. Therefore, it is essential for the\r\ndevelopment of humanistic nursing to explore and describe its\r\nintersubjective character.\r\n\r\nAlthough many nurses have agreed in principle about the importance of\r\nthis work, they also have expressed the feelings of frustration and\r\ndiscouragement attending it. There are real difficulties involved in\r\nattempting to describe something so real yet so nebulous as \"the\r\nbetween.\" The descriptions must be derived from our own real nursing\r\nexperiences. This means that we must develop habits of conscious\r\nawareness of experience, of recall, and of reflection. Then we must\r\nstruggle with our language finding the words in our physically and\r\ntechnologically oriented vocabularies, perhaps even creating terms, to\r\nconvey the substance and flavor of the experience of intersubjectivity.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, description of the intersubjective quality of nursing is\r\ndifficult because of its peculiar pervasiveness. Whether it is\r\nconsciously recognized or not, it is part of every nursing transaction.\r\nHowever, to consider and explore intersubjectivity solely as a component\r\nor constituent of nursing, even a necessarily inherent or an essential\r\none, would be to see it out of true perspective. The \"between\" is more\r\nthan a factor or facet of nursing; it is the basic relation in which and\r\nthrough which nursing can occur. So the question remains. How can our\r\nexperiences, our angular views, our glimpses of this foundation, this\r\nnecessary means of nursing, be conceptualized and shared?\r\n\r\nOnce while reflecting on the nature of nursing against a background of\r\nnotions about intersubjectivity drawn from experience and literature and\r\ntesting them against my own real life experiences of nursing, I suddenly\r\nsaw that _nursing itself is a particular form of human dialogue_. This\r\ninsight occurred to me with clarity, conviction, and all the force of a\r\nbrand new idea. It was so obvious, so distinct, so simple, so clearly a\r\ncentral intuition that could illuminate the phenomenon of nursing from\r\nwithin. I experienced the idea as fresh and excitingly full of promise.\r\n\r\nYet, when I said it out loud, \"Nursing is dialogue,\" the words seemed\r\ntoo meager to convey the true meaning of the idea and its real\r\nsignificance. There was, furthermore, an annoying shadow of familiarity\r\nlurking about it. It was almost as if I had expressed something similar\r\npreviously. At first, I hesitated to share this insight with others for\r\nfear they would extinguish it by saying, \"of course, everyone knows\r\nthat,\" or \"I've heard you say something like that before.\" Still, I\r\nexperienced it as an idea I _had_ to express. Moved by the pressure of\r\nfeelings of responsibility and desire to share, in 1973 I wrote a paper,\r\n\"The Dialogue Called Nursing.\" {23}\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, that paper has the marks of a hesitant beginning,\r\nrestrained by cautious statements and supposedly protective references\r\nto existential literature. Dissatisfaction with it prompted further\r\nrethinking and revision. Searching through my files during this process,\r\nI found, to my great surprise, some notes on the dialogic nature of\r\nnursing written by myself three and six years previously. In fact, a\r\nthree-year-old note contained the very title, \"Dialogue Called Nursing\"!\r\nNow, how is it possible to grasp a truth and then \"forget\" that one\r\nknows it and later meet and grasp the old truth again as new? The\r\ndifference in these experiences of knowing, for me at least in this\r\ncase, is that now I know as if from the inside out that nursing is\r\ndialogical. The idea seems to have sprouted out of the lived phenomenon,\r\nto have broken forth from the ground of experience, as opposed to having\r\nbeen concluded in my earlier \"intellectual,\" \"theoretical,\" or\r\n\"philosophical\" ponderings. But how did the earlier idea, the conclusion\r\nthat nursing is dialogical, become a live option for me? Why did it\r\nappeal to me? How did it come to make sense in the first place if not\r\nbecause of my experience?\r\n\r\nThe concept and the actual experience revitalize each other. Perhaps\r\nthis is the value of an existentially grounded insight; it has a kind of\r\ndurability resulting from its continuous rejuvenation by the interplay\r\nof experiencing and conceptualizing. Some old ideas are always new. In\r\nthis spirit, this chapter looks again at humanistic nursing as lived\r\ndialogue.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIVED DIALOGUE\r\n\r\nThe central insight (intuition or idea) from which this exploration\r\ngrows is this: nursing itself is a form of human dialogue. I mean that\r\nthe phenomenon of nursing, that is, the nurturing, intersubjective\r\ntransaction, the event lived or experienced by the participants in the\r\neveryday world, is a dialogue.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written about dialogue and, as the word is now in vogue,\r\nit is being used in different ways. Here, the term \"dialogue\" is used to\r\ndenote a broader concept than the typical dictionary definition of\r\ndialogue as \"a conversation between two or more persons or between\r\ncharacters in a drama or novel.\" It is used in the existential sense. It\r\nimplies an \"ontological sphere,\" in Buber's terms, or the \"realm of\r\nbeing\" to which Marcel refers. Here it refers to a _lived_ dialogue,\r\nthat is, to a particular form of intersubjective relating. This may be\r\nunderstood in terms of seeing the other person as a distinct unique\r\nindividual and entering into relation with him. In other words, nursing\r\nis a dialogical mode of being in an intersubjective situation.\r\n\r\nAs in common usage, here also, the term \"dialogue\" implies\r\ncommunication, but in a much more general sense. It is not restricted to\r\nthe notion of sending and receiving messages verbally and nonverbally.\r\nRather, dialogue is viewed as communication in terms of call and\r\nresponse. {24}\r\n\r\nNursing implies a special kind of meeting of human persons. It occurs in\r\nresponse to a perceived need related to the health-illness quality of\r\nthe human condition. Within that domain, which is shared by other health\r\nprofessions, nursing is directed toward the goal of nurturing well-being\r\nand more-being (human potential). Nursing, therefore, does not involve a\r\nmerely fortuitous encounter but rather one in which there is purposeful\r\ncall and response. In this vein, humanistic nursing may be considered as\r\na special kind of lived dialogue.\r\n\r\n\r\nNURSING VIEWED AS DIALOGUE\r\n\r\nThese considerations of the dialogical character of nursing will be more\r\nfruitful if they are related to some concrete nursing experience.\r\nReflect for a moment on your daily nursing practice. Recall an\r\nencounter, a specific interaction with a patient (client). Try to\r\nremember the details. Where were you? What time of day was it? Who was\r\npresent? What was your state of being--what were you feeling, thinking,\r\ndoing? How did the interaction begin? What happened between you? What\r\nwas felt, said, done? What was left unsaid, undone? How did the\r\ninteraction end or close? How long did the flavor last? Now keep this\r\nconcrete instance of your lived nursing reality in mind and let it raise\r\nits questions in the following exploration.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeeting\r\n\r\nThe act of nursing involves a meeting of human persons. As was noted\r\nabove, it is a special or particular kind of meeting because it is\r\npurposeful. Both patient and nurse have a goal or expectation in mind.\r\nThe inter subjective transaction, therefore, has meaning for them; the\r\nevent is experienced in light of their goal(s). Or in other words, the\r\nliving human act of nursing is formed by its purpose. Its\r\ngoal-directedness colors the attributes and process of the nursing\r\ndialogue.\r\n\r\nWhen a nurse and patient come together in a nursing situation, their\r\nmeeting may be expected or planned by one or both or it may be\r\nunexpected by one or both. In any case, the goal or purpose of nursing\r\nholds. Even in a spontaneous interaction where they have met only by\r\nchance, in a health care facility or any place where one is identified\r\nas patient and the other as nurse, there is an implicit expectation that\r\nthe nurse will extend herself in a helpful way if the patient needs\r\nassistance. If the meeting is planned or expected, this factor\r\ninfluences the dialogue. Each comes with feelings aroused by\r\nanticipation of the event, for example anxiety, fear, dread, hope,\r\npleasure, waiting, impatience, dependence, hostility, responsibility.\r\n\r\nAnother factor experienced in their meeting is the amount of choice or\r\ncontrol either nurse or patient had over their coming together. In\r\ntoday's complex health care systems, a nurse may be assigned to care for\r\na particular patient, or for persons in an area or unit, or may be\r\ncalled into service through a registry, {25} or may be approached\r\ndirectly by a patient. From the other side, the patient also experiences\r\nvarying degrees of control over his meetings with nurses depending on\r\nthe system in which the health care is offered, his location, his\r\nfinancial means, and so forth. So when a patient and nurse do meet in a\r\ngiven instance, each comes to the situation bearing remnants of feeling\r\nof having caused or not having caused this encounter with this\r\nparticular individual. (Of course, even in the most de-individualized\r\nsystems the nurse and/or patient can still control their meetings to\r\nsome extent, for example, avoidance by the nurse being too busy or\r\navoidance by the patient feigning sleep.)\r\n\r\nThe patient and the nurse are two unique individuals meeting for a\r\npurpose. In the existential sense, each of these persons is his choice,\r\neach is his history. Each comes to meet the other with all that he is\r\nand all that he is not at this moment in this place. Each comes as a\r\nparticular incarnate being. Each is a specific being in a specific body\r\nthrough which he affects the other and the world and through which he is\r\naffected by them. This nurse who uses her eyes, ears, nose, hands, her\r\nbody, this way here and now meets this patient whose body in this\r\ncondition serves him this way here and now.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, both the patient and the nurse have the human capacity for\r\ndisclosing or enclosing themselves. So they have some control over the\r\nquality of their meeting by choosing how and how much to be open with\r\nand to be open to the other. Their openness is influenced by their views\r\nof the purpose of the meeting. In general, the patient expects to\r\nreceive help and the nurse expects to give it. However, their views may\r\ndiffer on the precise need and the kind of help to be given.\r\n\r\nAlso, although the nurse and the patient have the same goal, that is,\r\nwell-being and more-being, they have different modes of being in the\r\nshared situation. One's purpose is to nurture; the other's is to be\r\nnurtured. This difference in the perspectives from which they approach\r\nthe meeting is reflected in the kind and degree of their openness to\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nIn describing their experiences nurses often have revealed that they are\r\nopen to patients in a certain way. This is evident when nurse and\r\npatient meet. The nurse may have prior knowledge of the patient, perhaps\r\neven an image of him drawn from case history, charts, tour of duty\r\nreports, and so forth; or she may meet him as a total stranger. But when\r\nthey come together, the nurse sees \"the patient as a whole.\" This global\r\napprehension is not experienced as an additive summation but rather as a\r\ngestalt. It may result in a very clear \"picture\" of the patient's\r\ncondition with nursing action initiated almost before the picture\r\nregisters in full conscious awareness. Or the perception may be\r\nimprecise yet strong that \"something is wrong.\" From these experiences\r\none may infer that a nurse's openness involves being open to what is and\r\nto what is not in the patient's state of being as weighed against some\r\nnotion (or standard) of what \"ought\" to be, with the intention of doing\r\nsomething about the difference. Thus, the nurse is open-as-a-helper to\r\nthe patient. This kind of openness is a quality that characterizes the\r\nhumanistic nursing dialogue. Of course, every nurse-patient meeting\r\ndiffers, for each participant comes to the situation as the {26} unique\r\nindividual he is, with his own expectations and capacities for giving\r\nand taking help.\r\n\r\nWhen these factors are considered in terms of an actual personal nursing\r\nexperience (for instance, the example recalled above by the reader),\r\nthey highlight a tension in the lived nursing world. The meeting through\r\nwhich the nursing dialogue is initiated and consequently is possible is,\r\nto a certain extent, out of the nurse's control. She is assigned to\r\napproach or she approaches the patient in terms of her function. In this\r\nsense, \"the nurse\" is synonymous with the function \"nursing.\" Yet she\r\nexperiences each meeting as herself--a unique individual person, this\r\nhere-and-now being in this body responding in this situation. She is at\r\nonce a replaceable cog in a wheel of an incomprehensibly complex system\r\nand a unique human being sharing most intimately in another's search for\r\nthe meanings of suffering, living, dying. Can these two world views be\r\nreconciled? How can they be lived in the nursing dialogue?\r\n\r\n\r\nRelating\r\n\r\nAs a human response to a person in need, the nursing act is necessarily\r\nan intersubjective transaction. Or to put it in other words, regardless\r\nof the complexity of need and/or response, when nurse and patient meet\r\nin the event of nursing both have \"to do\" with each other. Since both\r\nare human, their doing with means being with. (Reflect for a moment on\r\nthe personally experienced patient encounter you recalled at the\r\nbeginning of this exploration. Relive it and see clearly again that the\r\nnursing dialogue involves being with and doing with the patient.)\r\n\r\nMen can do with and be with each other because they are able to see\r\nothers and things as distinct from themselves and enter into relation\r\nwith them. What distinguishes the human situation is that men can enter\r\ninto a dialogue with reality. They have a capacity for for internal\r\nrelationships, for knowing themselves and their worlds within\r\nthemselves, they can relate as subject to object (for example, as knower\r\nto thing known) and as subject to subject, that is, as person to person.\r\nBoth types of relationships are essential for genuine human existence.\r\n\r\nIt is natural, in fact unavoidable, for man to relate to his world as\r\nsubject to object. How could a person survive even one day without\r\nknowing and using objects? Therefore, man's abilities to abstract,\r\nobjectify, conceptualize, categorize, and so forth, are necessary for\r\neveryday living. Even beyond this, the human capacity for relating to\r\nthe other as object is basic to the advancement of mankind for it\r\nunderlies science, art, and philosophy. It is simply one way of being\r\nhuman.\r\n\r\nAnother mode of relating is open to men. Whenever two persons are\r\npresent to each other as human beings, the possibility of\r\nintersubjective dialogue exists. Since both are subjects with the\r\ncapabilities for internal relationships, they can be open, available,\r\nand knowable to each other. They can know each other within themselves.\r\nFurthermore, they can be truly with each other in the {27}\r\nintersubjective realm because while maintaining their own unique\r\nidentities, they can participate in an interior union. Intersubjective\r\nrelating is also necessary for human existence. For it is through his\r\nrelationships with other men that a person develops his human potential\r\nand becomes a unique individual.\r\n\r\nNursing, being an interhuman event, has within it possibilities for\r\nvarious types and degrees of relationships. Both nurse and patient can\r\nview themselves and the other as objects and as subjects or in any\r\nvariation or combination of these ways. A person can view and relate to\r\nanother person as an object, for instance as a mere function (\"patient,\"\r\n\"nurse,\" \"supervisor,\" \"medicine nurse,\" \"admitting nurse,\"\r\n\"administration\") or as a case or type (\"schizophrenic,\" \"cardiac,\"\r\n\"outpatient,\" \"readmission,\" \"bed patient,\" \"wheelchair patient,\" \"total\r\ncare patient,\" \"terminal patient\"). Such subject-object or \"I-It\"\r\nrelationships differ essentially from subject-subject or \"I-Thou\"\r\nrelationships.\r\n\r\nAs the derivation of the term indicates, an object is something placed\r\nbefore or opposite; it is anything that can be apprehended\r\nintellectually. Through objectification the object is de-individualized\r\nand therefore made replaceable for the purpose of study by any other\r\nobject with the same properties. It is indifferent to the act by which\r\nit is thought and, therefore, the subject studying the object may also\r\nbe replaced by a similar subject.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is possible to view a person as an object, persons and\r\nthings are necessarily different kinds of objects. A thing, as object,\r\nis open to a subject's scrutiny, while a person, as object, can make\r\nhimself knowable or set up barriers to objectification. He can keep his\r\nthoughts to himself, remain silent, or deliberately conceal some of his\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nThrough the scientific objective approach, that is, subject-object\r\nrelating, it is possible to gain certain knowledge about a person;\r\nthrough intersubjective, that is, subject-subject relating, it is\r\npossible to know a person in his unique individuality. Thus, both\r\nsubject-subject and subject-object relationships are essential to the\r\nclinical nursing process. Both are integral elements of humanistic\r\nnursing.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresence\r\n\r\nIn the nursing world, as in the world at large, human encounters may\r\nrange from the trivial to the extremely significant. Within a day's\r\nwork, the nurse may experience many levels of intersubjectivity from the\r\nlowest level of being called on as a function or being used as an\r\nobject, to the other end of the scale of being recognized as a presence\r\nor a thou in genuine dialogue.\r\n\r\nNursing activities bring a nurse and patient into close physical\r\nproximity, but this in itself does not guarantee genuine\r\nintersubjectivity in which a man relates to another person as a\r\n\"presence\" rather than an object. A presence cannot be grasped or seized\r\nlike an object. It cannot be demanded or {28} commanded; it only can be\r\nwelcomed or rejected. In a sense, it lies beyond comprehension and can\r\nonly be invoked or evoked.\r\n\r\nThere is a quality of unpredictableness or spontaneity about genuine\r\ndialogue. A nurse may be going through her daily activities, functioning\r\neffectively, relating humanely, when suddenly she is stopped by\r\nsomething in the patient, perhaps a look of fear, a tug at her sleeve, a\r\nmoan, a reaching for her hand, a question, emptiness. In a suspenseful\r\npause two persons hover between their private worlds and the realm of\r\nintersubjectivity. Two humans stand on the brink of the between for a\r\nprecious moment filled with promise and fear. With my hand on the\r\ndoorknob to open myself from within, I hesitate--should I, will I let me\r\nout, let him in? Time is suspended, then moves again as I move with\r\nresolve to recognize, to give testimony to the other presence.\r\n\r\nThus, for genuine dialogue to occur there must be a certain openness, a\r\nreceptivity, readiness, or availability. The open or available person\r\nreveals himself as \"present.\" This is not the same as being attentive; a\r\nlistener may be attentive and still refuse to give himself. Visible\r\nactions do not necessarily signify presence so it cannot be proven. But\r\nit can be revealed directly and unmistakably in a glance, a touch, a\r\ntone of voice. (I can only ask you to substantiate this statement with\r\nyour own experience.) Availability implies, therefore, not only being at\r\nthe other's disposal but also being with him with the whole of oneself.\r\nFurthermore, it involves a reciprocity. The other is also seen as a\r\npresence, as a person rather than an object, such as a function or a\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nAs was discussed earlier, the nursing dialogue occurs within the domain\r\nof health and illness and has a purpose in the minds of the\r\nparticipants. Nursing is a lived dialogue (a being with and doing with)\r\naimed at nurturing well-being and more-being. This fact of\r\ngoal-directedness modifies or characterizes dialogical presence. As a\r\nnurse I try to be open to the other as a person, a presence, and to be\r\navailable to the other. Yet, when I reflect upon my presence, I realize\r\nthat my openness is an openness to a \"person-with-needs\" and my\r\navailability is an \"availability-in-a-helping-way.\" By comparison, my\r\nexperiences of openness and availability in social, family, or friend\r\nrelationships and in nurse-patient relationships differ. In the later, I\r\nfind myself responding with a kind of \"professional reserve.\" While it\r\nis true that what I conceive of as \"professional\" and the degree of\r\n\"reserve\" has varied over the years and from patient to patient,\r\nnevertheless, it is always a factor influencing the tone of my lived\r\ndialogue of nursing.\r\n\r\nIt is the qualitative differences in the various experiences of presence\r\nthat deserve, yet almost defy, description. For instance, the presence\r\nseems to have a different quality of _intimacy_. It is not experienced\r\nas less intense or less deep in the nurse-patient relationship, but as\r\nsomehow colored by a sense of responsibility or regard for what is seen\r\nas the patient's vulnerability. At times I am aware of a shadow of\r\n\"holding back\" in terms of what I consider \"nurturing\" {29} or\r\n\"therapeutically appropriate\" at a given moment. As a nurse, I find my\r\npresence flows through a filter of therapeutic tact.\r\n\r\nOr again, the _mutuality_ of presence may be experienced in the\r\nnurse-patient situation. At times I become consciously and acutely aware\r\nof the reciprocal flow of openness in the dialogue. It is as strong,\r\ndefinite, immediate, and total as in other dialogical relationships and\r\nyet it is somehow different. It is felt as a flow between two persons\r\nwith different modes of being in the shared situation. My reason for\r\nbeing there, to nurture, and his, to be nurtured, bob into my\r\nconsciousness like buoys marking the channel of openness.\r\n\r\nOften in nursing it is necessary to focus my attention on some aspect of\r\nthe patient's body or behavior. The patient may or may not have the same\r\nfocus of attention. At least momentarily then, or even for a prolonged\r\nperiod, I place some aspect of the patient before or opposite myself\r\n(that is, objectify it). And to the extent that this detail absorbs my\r\nattention, I lose my sight of and my relatedness to the whole person who\r\nhappens to be the patient. While I know this focusing on details to be a\r\nnecessary step in the nursing process, sometimes I find myself abruptly\r\nrefocusing my attention on the whole person with almost a twinge of\r\nguilt for having abandoned him. (Patients have described this\r\nuncomfortable intersubjective experience as feeling \"looked at\" or\r\n\"watched\" by staff.) At other times, on reflection, I find my attention\r\nwas oscillating between the detail and the person, or focusing on both\r\nrelating one to the other. From these experiences it is evident that\r\ndialogical presence is complicated in the nursing situation. It is\r\ninhibited when the focus of attention (of one or both participants) is\r\non the patient's body itself or on his behavior. Yet the body is an\r\nintegral part of the person and his behavior is an expression of his\r\nmode of existence or his way of being in the world. Man is an embodied\r\nbeing, and the nurse, in nurturing the patient's well-being and\r\nmore-being, must relate to him and his body in their mysterious\r\ninterrelatedness.\r\n\r\n\r\nCall and Response\r\n\r\nThe dialogical character of nursing may be explored further by\r\nconsidering it in the general sense of a call and response. Nursing is a\r\npurposeful call and response, that is, it is related to some particular\r\nkind of help in the domain of health and illness. A patient calls for a\r\nnurse with the expectation of being cared for, of having his need met.\r\nHe is asking for something. A nurse responds to a patient for the\r\npurpose of meeting his need, of caring for him. The nurse expects to be\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nIn reflecting on nursing experiences, it becomes obvious that the call\r\nand response in the nursing dialogue goes both ways for nursing is\r\ntransactional. Both patient and nurse call and respond. The pattern of\r\nthe dialogue is complex. It continues over time, from moments to years,\r\nin an ongoing sequence that either patient or nurse may begin,\r\ninterrupt, resume, or end. For instance, {30} the patient turns on his\r\ncall light to ask for something. This is not only a call but also a\r\nresponse to the nurse's previously stated suggestion that he use the\r\nsignal if he needs her help. Or again, a nurse may stop and talk with a\r\npatient during a chance meeting recalling that he previously had\r\nexpressed feelings of loneliness, boredom, pain, or joy. Also, other\r\npersons or events may interrupt or end a nursing dialogue. For instance,\r\nthe nurse is called away to help in another situation, the patient is\r\ndischarged on the nurse's day off, the patient expires.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the call and response are not only sequential but also\r\nsimultaneous. In this live dialogue both patient and nurse are calling\r\nand responding all at once. The patient's request, for instance, is a\r\ncall for help and at the same time a response to the nurse's\r\navailability or offer to be of help. From the other side, the _way_ a\r\nnurse responds to a patient's call is, _itself_, a call to him for a\r\nparticular kind of response, a call for his participation in the\r\ndialogue.\r\n\r\nReflect for a moment on your own example. Was your response to the\r\npatient influenced by the value you placed on such factors as his\r\nindependence, motivation, rehabilitation, growth, strengths, pathology;\r\non time, on place; on agency policy? Here again goal-directedness\r\naffects nursing dialogue. Our interpretation of the patient's calls as\r\nwell as our responses are colored by the aim of our practice. Our values\r\nare like calls within the calls. Or to state it differently, the values\r\nunderlying our practice give meaning to the calls.\r\n\r\nViewing dialogical nursing as a particular form of call and response\r\nhighlights its complexity. It reveals the intricacy not only of its\r\npatterns of flow but also of its means of expression. Nursing is a lived\r\ncall and response reflective of every mode of human communication.\r\n\r\nMuch has been studied and written about verbal dialogue between patient\r\nand nurse. Examining verbal exchanges from the perspective of call and\r\nresponse could uncover even more about this aspect of the nursing\r\ndialogue.\r\n\r\nIt is more difficult to find written descriptions of nonverbal\r\nnurse-patient communication, although this aspect is generally\r\nrecognized to be of equal significance. Here again the call and response\r\nframework could be a useful aid. For instance, what does a nurse's mere\r\nphysical presence mean to a patient either as a call or response? Or\r\nfrom the nurse's standpoint, under what circumstances is a patient's\r\npresence experienced as a call and, even more, as a call for a\r\nparticular nursing response? What prompts us to respond in terms of his\r\nposture, his color, his facial expression, his behavior, the appearance\r\nof his clothes? Are we almost unconsciously checking some kind of \"vital\r\nsigns\" in the inter subjective realm?\r\n\r\nNursing dialogue is characterized by the unique feature of occurring\r\nthrough nursing acts. The dialogue is experienced in what the nurse does\r\nwith the patient. A call and response of caring is lived through in\r\nnurse-patient transactions (nursing care activities) from the simplest,\r\nmost basic acts of bathing and feeding to the most dramatic\r\nresuscitation. {31}\r\n\r\nThe nursing act itself contains a meaning for each person in the\r\ndialogue and the meanings may differ (for example, touching and being\r\ntouched, feeding and being fed, bathing and being bathed). In addition,\r\nas a behavioral expression, the nursing act conveys a message, a\r\nreflection of the nurse's state of being (for example, anxious, hurried,\r\ntroubled, absent, present, fully present). Furthermore, a nursing act\r\nmay serve as an occasion, or even a catalyst, for opening or moving the\r\ndialogue in some direction on a verbal level (for example, bathing a\r\npatient may prompt his discussion of his body image or of his fear of\r\ndisfigurement).\r\n\r\nThe complexity of possibilities in this unique feature of nursing\r\ndialogue (occurring through nursing acts) is staggering, especially so\r\nwhen one considers the additional factors associated with the effects of\r\ntechnological advances in nursing. Think, for instance, of the influence\r\non your nursing dialogue of any technical nursing procedure. What\r\nhappens between you and the patient when you place a thermometer into\r\nhis mouth? Take his blood pressure? Give him an injection? Aspirate him?\r\nDo any form of monitoring, from the simplest to the most complex? Are\r\nthe technical procedures and instruments bridges or barriers in the\r\nbetween?\r\n\r\n\r\nDIALOGICAL NURSING IN THE REAL WORLD\r\n\r\nIt is necessary now to look again at dialogical nursing in a broader\r\nperspective, for by limiting the exploration to the nurse, the patient,\r\nand their between, the previous discussion grossly oversimplified the\r\nway the dialogue actually evolves in real life. In the above, it was as\r\nif nursing were a drama acted out by two characters on a specially\r\ndesigned stage where precisely placed props lay ready to serve the\r\nactors and the passage of time is controlled by the chiming of a clock\r\nor the dimming of lights. As it is actually lived, the nursing dialogue\r\nis subjected to all the chaotic forces of real life. Nursing takes place\r\nin a real world of men and things in time and space. In many cases, it\r\nis a special world, a health system world, within the everyday world.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Human Beings\r\n\r\nThe dialogue lived between nurse and patient is affected by their\r\nnumerous other interhuman relationships. For a nurse to be genuinely\r\nwith a patient involves her coexperiencing his world with him. His\r\nfamily, friends, and significant others are a very real part of this\r\nworld whether they are physically present or distant. So to be open to\r\nthe patient is to be open to him as a person necessarily related to\r\nother men.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in caring for a patient the nurse relates to him not only\r\nas an individual patient but also as one in a group of patients. The\r\ngroup may be physically present (for example, in a ward, in an intensive\r\ncare unit, in a {32} waiting room, in a dining room, in a therapeutic\r\ngroup) or they may be present in the nurse's mind (for example, while\r\ncaring for one she may think \"I have three more patients to visit,\" \"so\r\nand so needs his medication in five minutes,\" \"I promised so and so I'd\r\nget back to him,\" \"three other patients are waiting to be fed\"). Even\r\nwhen the nurse is responsible for only one patient, she often views him\r\nin relation to other patients she has nursed.\r\n\r\nThe nurse herself also functions within complex networks of interhuman\r\nrelationships that affect the nursing dialogue. As health care becomes\r\nmore specialized, more groups of health care workers arise and the\r\nvarious groups become more diversified. So the nurse's intersubjective\r\ntransactions with her patients occur within an intra- and\r\ninterdisciplinary milieu of constantly changing personnel, functions,\r\nand roles. While her own role is expanding, extending, deepening,\r\nbroadening, becoming more specialized, she must relate with others\r\nundergoing similar change. And here again, as with the patients so with\r\nher colleagues, the nurse is constantly faced with the possibility and\r\nnecessity of relating to others in terms of their functions and as\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nFinally, it should be recognized that while it is easy and common to\r\nthink of \"the nurse\" as synonymous with the function \"nursing,\" in real\r\nlife the nurse is a human being necessarily related to others. She\r\nlearns to focus on those present in her here and now work situation. But\r\nshe too is her history and brings to her work world all that she is and\r\nall that she is not including her past experienced and future\r\nanticipated interhuman relationships. So each nurse affects her peopled\r\nnursing world and is affected by it in her own unique way.\r\n\r\n>From the other side, the patient also enters into the nursing dialogue\r\nwith his various networks of interhuman relationships. How he\r\nexperiences his relationships with his family and significant others,\r\nwith the patient groups of which he becomes a part in different degrees,\r\nwith members of various disciplines and health services groups, with\r\n\"the\" nurse and \"his\" nurse, all influence the lived nursing dialogue.\r\nIt is always colored by the patient's current mode of interpersonal\r\nrelating. Of course, the current mode reflects his past, for example,\r\nlearned habits of response, and his future, for example, concerns about\r\nanticipated changes in interpersonal relationships due to the effects of\r\nhis illness. In some cases, the intersubjective behavior itself becomes\r\nthe focus of the nursing dialogue as the area of the patient's greatest\r\nneeds in attaining well-being and more-being.\r\n\r\n\r\nThings\r\n\r\nThe nursing dialogue takes place in a real world of things, ordinary\r\nthings of everyday living and all forms of health care equipment. Both\r\ntypes of objects affect the nurse-patient transactions and their\r\ninfluence varies for they may be experienced differently by nurse and\r\npatient.\r\n\r\nOrdinary objects used everyday--eating utensils, clothes, furniture,\r\nbooks, television sets--are so familiar that one usually takes their use\r\nfor granted. {33} However due to illness a person may be unable to\r\nmanipulate a knife and fork, for example. They become frustrating\r\nobjects. His tools are no longer extensions of himself but impediments\r\nand barriers. He feels handicapped. His world of things changes.\r\n\r\nOn entering a health care facility, the patient finds himself in a\r\nforeign world of strange objects. In place of his familiar possessions\r\nhe is surrounded by equipment, machines, instruments, solutions, and so\r\nforth. He may experience these as bewildering, frightening, painful,\r\nsupportive, soothing, life-sustaining. The nurse, on the other hand, may\r\nexperience these same objects quite differently. To her they may be\r\nfamiliar tools, useful aids, complex machines, annoyingly defective\r\nequipment. Even in a situation that does not have special equipment, for\r\ninstance in a home, the patient's world of things changes as the nurse\r\nconverts ordinary objects into tools. Thus, while nurse and patient\r\nshare a situation, the things in their shared world have different\r\nmeanings for each. The things themselves as well as the persons'\r\nrelations to them can serve to enhance or inhibit the intersubjective\r\ntransaction of nursing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTime\r\n\r\nTo view dialogical nursing as it is actually experienced in the real\r\nworld, one must conceive of it as occurring in time, not simply measured\r\ntime but also time as lived by patient and nurse. Certainly both\r\nparticipants are caught up in measured time and this influences their\r\nshared world, for example, eight-hour tours of duty, a day off, surgery\r\nscheduled at 8:00 a.m., discharge in two days, visit three times a week,\r\nclinic appointment in 30 days. Thus, to an extent, both patient and\r\nnurse must live by the clock and calendar.\r\n\r\nHowever, equally important, or perhaps even more important, in the lived\r\ndialogue of nursing is the participants' experience of time. Some\r\nreferences were made to lived time in the section on call and response\r\nwhere it was noted how the nursing dialogue unfolds over time from\r\nmoments to years. How the involved persons experience this continuity is\r\nan individual matter.\r\n\r\nThe nurse may conceive of herself as one of many persons contributing to\r\na continuous stream of caring for the patient. So she will give and hear\r\nand write and read reports, note observations, keep records. She will\r\ncarry an image of the patient in her mind continually adding to it or\r\nchanging it with each interaction or report. Sometimes, after not seeing\r\nthe patient for a time, on meeting him again she will \"pick up where she\r\nleft off,\" treating him as if he were the same person, as if days,\r\nmonths, years of living had not intervened. \"Oh, it's him again.\" Or she\r\nmay be startled by the visible changes and resume the dialogue from that\r\npoint. Or even if change is not visible, she may be aware that it may\r\nhave occurred and try to fill in the gap.\r\n\r\nThese possibilities may be mirrored from the patient's standpoint, for\r\nhe likewise experiences continuity or lack of it in his care. And yet,\r\nthe experience must be different for him. For instance, nurses may think\r\nof continuity of care in terms of \"coverage\" for a planned program of\r\ncare. So it has often been {34} claimed that \"the nurse is with the\r\npatient 24 hours a day.\" From the patient's point of view this is not\r\ntrue. _A_ nurse may be with him but each nurse is different. The\r\nfunction of nursing may be continuous, but individual nurses come and\r\ngo; the day nurse, the evening nurse, the night nurse are each unique\r\nindividuals. And the nursing dialogue as lived, intersubjective\r\ntransaction occurs between a particular nurse and a particular patient.\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of a nurse and a hospitalized patient spending a day\r\ntogether, we usually are referring to eight hours out of a 24-hour day.\r\nThey may both experience the spacing of this time by functions or\r\nactivities such as meal time, medicine time, visiting time. Yet the\r\nmeasured minutes and hours are experienced differently by each in their\r\ndifferent modes of being in the situation. Nurses often express feelings\r\nof not having enough time to give the care they want to give; of having\r\ntoo many demands on their time; of trying to \"make time\" for patients\r\nwho ask \"do you have a minute?\" Patients live their time in relation to\r\nboredom, pain, loneliness, separation, waiting. The nursing dialogue\r\nruns its course in clock time but both nurse and patient live it in\r\ntheir private times.\r\n\r\nWhen the nursing dialogue is genuinely intersubjective, it has a kind of\r\n_synchronicity_ that is evident in the nurse's being with and doing with\r\nthe patient. This kind of timing is related to the transactional\r\ncharacter of nursing and to its goal of nurturing the development of\r\nhuman potential. It is experienced in openness, availability, and\r\npresence, as well as in nursing care activities. The nurse feels in\r\nharmony with the rhythm of the dialogue and, sensing the timing of its\r\nflow, she paces her call and response to patient's ability to call and\r\nrespond in that moment. So, as a nurse, you may find yourself almost\r\nunconsciously or intuitively waiting, holding back, anticipating, urging\r\nthe patient. This kind of synchronization or timing is intersubjective\r\nfor the clues or reasons for encouraging or waiting are not found solely\r\nin the patient's behavior nor only in the nurse's knowledge or\r\nexperience. \"Good\" or \"right\" timing somehow involves the \"between.\" It\r\nimplies that nurse and patient share not only clock time but private,\r\nlived time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpace\r\n\r\nBy exploring the dialogue of nursing as it is lived in the real world\r\nthe factor of space becomes apparent. Here again the dialogue is\r\ninfluenced by space as it is measured and space as it is experienced by\r\nnurse and patient. When thinking of health care facilities, \"space\" may\r\nbe synonymous with such things as beds, waiting rooms, interview rooms,\r\ntreatment areas, size of patient's room, visiting areas, a quiet place,\r\na private place. Naturally, the physical setting, whether in a hospital,\r\nhome, anywhere in the community, can serve to enhance or impede the\r\nnursing dialogue. However, the person's experience of the space may be\r\neven more important.\r\n\r\nSpace is lived in terms of large and small, far and near, long and\r\nshort, high and deep, above and below, before and behind, left and\r\nright, across, all {35} around, empty, crowded. These perceptions and\r\nexperiences of space may be influenced by the effects of illness, for\r\nexample, changes in vision or locomotor ability. Thus, a patient's\r\nspatial world may change, expand or diminish, become unmanageable or\r\nmanageable day by day. Furthermore, a patient's attitude toward and\r\nexperience of a particular place may be affected by his mental\r\nassociation to it (for example, oncology ward, psychiatric unit), his\r\nprevious experience in it (for example, emergency room, operating room),\r\nor a desire to be somewhere else (for example, \"This is a nice hospital\r\nbut I'd rather be home\").\r\n\r\nPlace is a kind of lived space. It is personalized space. One says, for\r\nexample, \"Come to my place\" meaning to my home. Or even more personally,\r\nit relates to where I feel I belong or am, for instance, \"he put me in\r\nmy place; I felt put down.\" The patient may feel \"out of place\" in the\r\nhealth care setting, while it may be commonplace to the nurse. There may\r\nbe areas in the setting that the patient experiences as his territory,\r\nfor example, his bed, his room, his ward; while other areas are \"theirs\"\r\nor \"restricted to authorized personnel.\" So a nurse and a patient may be\r\nin a place together, yet one feels at home and the other does not. For\r\nthe nurse to be really _with_ the patient involves her knowing him in\r\n_his_ lived space, in his here and now.\r\n\r\nLived space is interrelated with lived time. Patients hospitalized for a\r\nlong time often express a proprietary attitude toward the hospital. The\r\nsame holds true for personnel. With time and familiarity a feeling of\r\nreciprocal belongingness grows. The person belongs in the place and the\r\nplace belongs to the person. On the other hand, when a person finds\r\nhimself in a new place he may feel the discomfort of not belonging. This\r\nis as true for the nurse in an unfamiliar setting as for the patient.\r\nAgain in this regard, the lived nursing dialogue is enhanced by the\r\nnurse's awareness of not only her own experience of space but the\r\npatient's as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThis chapter explored the basic view of humanistic nursing as a\r\nphenomenon in which human persons meet in a nurturing, intersubjective\r\ntransaction. Beginning with the central intuition that nursing is lived\r\ndialogue, the examination turned to its existential source, the nursing\r\nsituation as it is lived. Reflection on actual experience clarified the\r\nphenomena of meeting, relating, presence, and call and response as they\r\noccur in humanistic nursing. Dialogical nursing was then reconsidered in\r\nbroader perspective as it actually evolves in the real world of men and\r\nthings in time and space.\r\n\r\nAs scientific advances multiply in the health field, nursing is swept\r\nalong in the tide. Continuous technological changes, ever increasing\r\nspecialization, emphasis in nursing education and research on scientific\r\nmethodology all have marked influence on the development of nursing.\r\nScience (with a capital S) colors the nursing world. At every turn it\r\npermeates the nurse's being with and {36} doing with the patient. It\r\noffers a certain security by providing a consistent and effective\r\napproach to some problems and questions, and, in some cases, results in\r\ngeneral laws to guide practice. At the same time, in the lived nursing\r\nworld the nurse experiences a reality that is not open to the scientific\r\napproach, a reality not always verifiable through sense perception, a\r\nreality of individuality. The uniqueness of individuality (her own as\r\nwell as the patient's) pervades the nursing dialogue.\r\n\r\nThe ever-present individual differences may be regarded as intractable\r\nelements to be conquered for the sake of the efficiency of the system\r\n(for example, fit the patient to the treatment program). Or they may be\r\nvalued as indicators of the inexhaustible richness of human potential to\r\nbe developed. In their daily practice, nurses are drawn toward the two\r\nrealities--the reality of the \"objective\" scientific world and the\r\nreality of the \"subjective-objective\" lived world. This tension is lived\r\nout in the nursing act. Doing with and being with the patient calls for\r\na complementary synthesis by the nurse of these two forms of human\r\ndialogue, \"I-It\" and \"I-Thou.\" Both are inherent in humanistic nursing\r\nfor it is a dialogue lived in the objective and intersubjective realms\r\nof the real world.\r\n\r\nIn the highly complex health care system nurses experience many demands\r\nfrom many directions. Their clinical judgments in daily practice must be\r\nmade within a continuous stream of decisions about priorities of\r\ninvestment of their time and efforts. Sometimes, survival in the system\r\nreduces the nurse to following the line of least resistance, that is,\r\nresponding to the immediate or to the loudest demands. However, even\r\nwith their total commitment this course of response does not guarantee\r\nthat nurses are making their greatest possible contribution to health\r\ncare. This can happen only if we are able to see demands and\r\nopportunities in relation to our reason for being--nurturing the\r\nwell-being and more-being of persons in need.\r\n\r\nHumanistic nursing, viewed as a lived dialogue, offers a frame of\r\norientation that places the center of our universe at the nurse-patient\r\ninter subjective transaction. Insightful recognition of the lived\r\nnursing act as the point around which all our functions revolve, could\r\nrequire a Copernican revolution of orientation of some nurses. It does\r\nprovide, for all nurses, a true sense of direction that can be\r\nactualized by each unique nurse through creative human dialogue. {37}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nPHENOMENON OF COMMUNITY\r\n\r\n\r\nHumanistic nursing creates, happens within, and is affected by\r\ncommunity. This chapter will discuss the abstract term \"community.\" To\r\nstimulate thought on a nurse's influence on community, consideration\r\nwill be given to three points: (1) my angular view of community and its\r\nevolvement, (2) how man has considered community over time, (3) how a\r\nhuman being comes to be through community.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY ANGULAR VIEW\r\n\r\nOne can view members of a family, a student class, a hospital unit, a\r\nhospital staff, several related hospital staffs, health services\r\norganizations within a geographic area, a profession, a town to a world\r\nor universe as community. Man's mind, my mind, determines where I\r\nsuperimpose the limits or lift the limits or relate components. In _The\r\nRepublic_ Plato depicted a community as a macrocosm.[1] Its nature was\r\nconditioned by the kinds of men, the microcosms, that composed it. The\r\nmacrocosm was a reflection of its microcosms.\r\n\r\nSo each human person, each nurse, as a microcosm, could make a\r\ndifference. Reflecting on the lived worlds of nurses, their communities,\r\nif we use Plato's philosophical analogy of macrocosm-microcosm, despite\r\nthe varieties of situation, we can make meaningful a basic concept of\r\ncommunity. Such a concept utilized by a nurse to view her particular\r\nongoing changing world can help her to understand more realistically,\r\nsurvive within, and strugglingly participate as a quality force.\r\n\r\nTo be a quality force within community a nurse must open her being to\r\nthe endless innovative possibilities and unattempted choices available\r\nto her. {38} The ability to thus open one's self requires our exposing\r\nour biases, the shades through which we regard the world, to the\r\nsunlight. In nursing our shades often are closed categories, labels,\r\ndiagnoses, trite superficial hackneyed expressions learned by us, taught\r\nto us as fact, taken in unexamined, and left unreexamined despite other\r\nchanges in ourselves and our situations. Socrates said, and it still\r\nholds, that the unexamined life is not worth living. Our shades can be\r\ncherished concepts, beliefs that guide us automatically rather than\r\nthoughtfully. Whether they are entirely myth or partial truths, they can\r\ncause us agonizing dilemma because they obscure the obviously relevant\r\nand the possibilities beyond. A concept of community, if grasped and if\r\na nurse is truly consciously aware, can help her to understand how her\r\nnursing world has evolved, is presently, and how she can be, to shape\r\nits future in accordance with her values.\r\n\r\nAs nurses one of our shades is often the confining labels we give to\r\nourselves as doers in service giving profession. I would like to go on\r\nrecord as most respectful of this aspect of my world. I regret,\r\nnonetheless, that we have not always similarly crystallized and\r\nfloodlighted the discovery and creative possibilities in our\r\ncommunities. In our very personal, intimate, involved professional\r\nnursing relations with other man we are privileged to be included in\r\nhuman happenings open to no other group. As nurses, we have had and are\r\nhaving emphasized to us the importance of facts handed to us. Can we\r\nactuate the importance of the knowledge of man that becomes part of us\r\nthrough our nursing worlds? It is hard to honor the significance of the\r\neveryday, the commonplace, the intimately known? It has been said that\r\none could know of the whole universe if one could make every possible\r\nrelationship starting from a piece of bread. Think of a \"simple\" or\r\n\"routine\" nursing situation. Think of its true complexity and how it can\r\ntrigger puzzlement, wonderment, and thinking. As learning situations,\r\nnurses' situations are existentially priceless. Returning now to Plato's\r\nconception of community understood through the terms macrocosm and\r\nmicrocosm, what can the nursing world situation reveal to us of\r\ncommunity? What are the qualities of the participants, the microcosms,\r\nand how are these qualities reflected in our nursing communities?\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY: THE SHADES OF MY WORLD, BRACKETED\r\n\r\nIn years past as a public health mental health psychiatric nurse I have\r\nstructured facts about man, family, and community precisely for\r\npresentation. Approaching the data sociopsychologically I framed it in\r\nthe public health model of promotion of health, prevention of illness,\r\ntreatment, rehabilitation, and maintenance. I thought of family\r\nsociologically as nuclear, procreative, and extended. In accordance with\r\nthe psychoanalytic model, family members were oral, anal, oedipal,\r\nlatent, homosexual, adolescent, heterosexual, and/or mature. Community,\r\nlike person and family, was considered according to a {39} closed\r\nparadigm, ranging from ideal to abysmal, from the smallest to the\r\nlargest unit in which persons congregated for common purposes. I\r\nselected from experience nursing examples to make these\r\nsociopsychological public health constructs meaningful. I did not start\r\nfrom nursing experiences to come up with nursing concepts of man,\r\nfamily, and community. I denied my particular self as a source of\r\nknowledge of these areas. Had education programmed me to value only\r\nothers' ideas gleaned in the classroom or from books? I projected this\r\ndevaluation of my own ideas onto my colleagues and until I really knew\r\nthem gave them what I thought they wanted, others' ideas. Presently I\r\nprize my uncertainty about the nature of man in family and community and\r\nmy striving toward an ever explorative process of being and becoming,\r\navailable for surprise. Paradoxically, I believe it was these very same\r\ncapacities, uncertainty and striving, that compelled my superimposing on\r\nmy colleagues with certainty other persons' and other professions'\r\nviews. Actually, my certainty about the conundrums: man, family,\r\ncommunity come only in particulars and only in fits and starts, and my\r\ncertainty is at once a truth and a nontruth. I see my aim as ever\r\nstriving toward certainty while constantly wrestling with the discomfort\r\nof uncertainty.\r\n\r\n\r\nEACH NURSE: A _NOETIC LOCUS_[2]\r\n\r\nEach nurse is a \"knowing place.\" It feels as if my greatest talents, as\r\na human nurse person, awaited my acceptance that came through as I\r\nrelated to the existentialist thinking of persons like Martin Buber,\r\nTeilhard de Chardin, Frederick Nietzsche, Karl Popper, Hermann Hesse,\r\nWilfrid Desan, and Norman Cousins. Now when I think of the\r\nphenomena--man, family, community--Theresa G. Muller, nurse educator and\r\nclinician, who quoted Hersey from his novel, _A Single Pebble_, comes to\r\nmind.[3] He said, \"I approached the river as a dry scientific problem; I\r\nfound it instead an avenue along which human beings moved whom I had not\r\nthe insight, even though I had the vocabulary, to understand.\" I\r\nconsider my greatest gifts as a human being nurse my ability to relate\r\nto other man, to wonder, search, and imagine about my experience, and to\r\ncreate out of what I come to know. My ever developing internalized\r\ncommunity of world thinkers dynamically interrelated with my conscious\r\nawareness of my experienced nursing realm allows my appreciation of my\r\nhuman gifts and the ever enrichment of myself as a \"knowing place.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNURSE: EXPERIENCE INTERNALIZED\r\n\r\nNursing experience taught me that each man, each family, each community\r\nwas at once alike and different. Hesse, an existential novelist, in\r\n_Steppenwolf_, {40} describes each man who has become in family and\r\ncommunity as like an onion with hundreds of integuments or a texture\r\nwith many threads.[4] Then man's differences would be in the quality of\r\nhis integuments and their development or in his threads in their\r\npreponderance. Contemplating the struggles in community regarding mutual\r\nunderstanding, I expanded Hesse's conception of man and found my vision\r\nof community to be a salad tossing or a patchwork quilt tumble drying.\r\n\r\nValuing the complexity of this conception of man and therefore of\r\ncommunity I find myself smiling at the naivety of the earlier more\r\nstatic frames of order I superimposed on these phenomena. These\r\noversimplifications maintained the shade through which I viewed my\r\nworld. The shade was: others are knowing places, they are responsible;\r\ntherefore if I quote authority from outside of myself, I can speak with\r\ncertainty about what I know and believe and no one can attack me. And\r\nyet, my unique knowledge was not given and so my defense, my clutching\r\nat security foiled my human need for conceptualization of and expression\r\nof my own nurse vision of reality. This defeated the development by me\r\nof nursing theory.\r\n\r\nNow I realize how I underestimated the potentialities of my nursing\r\neffect, of the difference I made, and could make. Just consider the\r\ngiven human uniqueness of each participant in the nursing situation\r\nwhose familial potential goes back to an origin of thinking being or\r\nconsciousness, and forward to his anticipation of the future, his\r\neternity.\r\n\r\nIn the nursing literature, it is rather infrequent that we\r\nphilosophically share our innermost thoughts, dreams, ideals, and\r\nstrivings without a strong overlay of indoctrination or conversion.\r\nNietzsche presents philosophy as autobiographical, such sharing does not\r\noffer maps. It could offer relevant resources and stimulate other nurses\r\nto influence the shape and becoming of the profession.\r\n\r\nThis chapter attempts to discuss ideas of community, the macrocosm, by\r\nconsidering man, the microcosm, as he develops in family and community.\r\nThe ideas represent my \"here and now\" as it reflects my past and\r\nanticipated nursing world, including my hopes and expectations.\r\n\r\n\r\nMan's Experience\r\n\r\nEach human being carries a view of persons, families, and communities\r\nshaded by the views of his nuclear family. The past usually is\r\ncorrected; it is never erased. So in his family of origin man\r\ninternalizes ideas of \"right-wrong,\" \"appropriate-inappropriate,\"\r\n\"expected-unexpected.\" Each family's shaded world echoes its\r\nprocreators' familial, psychosocialeconomic, religious and experiential\r\nbreadth, closely resembled or distorted. Two persons, perhaps more,\r\nusually husband and wife, bring shaded views together in some\r\ncombination or balance that becomes the \"stuff,\" the authority, of {41}\r\ntheir children's worlds. Thus, children see their early worlds through\r\nthe complementariness and conflict of this initial home view, acting at\r\ntimes with it; at times against it.\r\n\r\nAdults, in response to and through one another, procreate new sensitive\r\nbeings whom they want and/or do not want and whom they may and/or may\r\nnot experience as their responsibility in varying degrees. Marcel, a\r\nFrench existentialist philosopher, views procreation and responsible\r\nparenthood as quite different. My past nursing experience substantiates\r\nthis. Marcel expresses my bias about responsible parenthood, and this\r\nstatement is also worthy of consideration by nurses in positions of\r\nauthority to others. He says, \"We have to lay down the principle that\r\nour children (or those for whom we care) are destined, as we are\r\nourselves, to render a special service, to share in a work, we have\r\nhumbly to acknowledge that we cannot conceive of this work in its\r\nentirety and that _a fortiori_ we are incapable of knowing or imagining\r\nhow it is destined to shape itself for the young will, it is our\r\nprovince to awaken to a consciousness of itself.\"[5] Think of this\r\nstatement of responsible authority. How has it been evidenced in\r\nfamilies and nursing situations of your nursing world? What are your\r\nexpectations of your patients or nurses with whom you work?\r\n\r\nTeilhard de Chardin, paleontologist, biologist, and philosopher, like\r\nNietzsche, depicts man as lacking a fixed nature with his own mode of\r\nbeing as his fundamental project.[6] Initially, each person takes on a\r\nmode of being in his world dependent upon his degree of freedom and the\r\nhow and what of the world as presented by his family and perceived by\r\nhim. The world as presented is reflective of the family's culture, their\r\nprovincial world view, their unique experienced \"here and now,\" and the\r\ntimes. Metaphorically, the family's lived world, how they experience at\r\nthis particular cross-section of their lives, can be symbolically\r\ndescribed as a kaleidoscopic telescoping of its past and anticipated\r\nfuture. Now, this would be what was presented at any particular time.\r\nWhat would a child's perception do to this metaphorical symbol? The\r\nchild's current human development and his narrow experience would be\r\nlike a circus house mirror that would interpret the metaphorical symbol\r\ndistortedly. Witness a three-year-old speaking questioningly and\r\ncomplainingly about her tension headache to her mute, nonperceptive\r\ndoll, and asking her to please, please stop making such a mess and\r\nracket.\r\n\r\nThe earliest childhood views of family and community are influenced over\r\ntime, gradually and abruptly, and grow in complexity. The child's\r\npuzzlement is aroused by others' comings and goings, happenings within\r\nthe family, immediate neighborhood, and adjacent community, and the\r\nworld presented through books and technologically, on radio, television,\r\nand tape recorder. Each child attends these presentations with varying\r\nmeasures of complacency, questioning, bafflement, and involvement.\r\n\r\n{42}\r\n\r\nFor instance, for myself, as a child there was the excitement of the\r\nconstruction of a new house in the woods next door and meeting new\r\nneighbors. Initially my parents expressed their differences from\r\nourselves. The differences they perceived were followed by negative\r\nprojections on these unknown folk. Were these others really humanly\r\ndifferent? I investigated; my family investigated. The folk became\r\npersons. They expressed themselves differently in volume and sometimes\r\nin language. They looked different. Yet they were not fearsome. They\r\nfelt, cared, responded, and worried much as we did. Mutual knowledge\r\nallowed increasing closeness and liking.\r\n\r\nForbidden! This was the neighborhood across the tracks. I cried when an\r\nuncle teasingly proclaimed one day that my missing mother was over\r\nthere. Later I attended school with both white and black children who\r\nlived over there. And again, each was different, yet not different; each\r\nwas knowable, likeable, and loveable.\r\n\r\nAdult family members whispered about a neighbor woman from across the\r\nstreet. She was apparently hospitalized permanently. When I inquired as\r\nto why, eyebrows were raised and strange looks were exchanged. I was\r\ntold in a not believable way, \"She broke her leg falling off the back\r\nporch.\"\r\n\r\nA neighbor husband and wife frequently could be heard fighting both\r\nverbally and physically. Family talk at our house depicted the husband\r\nas \"evil,\" the wife as a \"poor soul.\" I did not enjoy being in these\r\npeoples' house. Perhaps the violence frightened me; perhaps I was\r\nuncertain when it might erupt? Perhaps I was concerned that I might one\r\nday somehow become part of such a situation? Now, looking back over the\r\nyears, I would guess that both this husband and wife were \"poor souls\"\r\nstruggling with their humanness as best they could.\r\n\r\nAn adolescent girl lived down the block. She was labeled as \"strange,\"\r\n\"peculiar,\" \"odd,\" \"crazy.\" Often one saw her talking to herself,\r\nskipping and rotating as she moved along in her always solitary and\r\nmysterious way. All expressed great sorrow for her always solitary and\r\nmysterious way. All expressed great sorrow for her elderly mother and\r\nfather on her admission to the \"State Hospital.\" Years later I wondered,\r\nand still wonder what happened to that girl, herself? What kind of an\r\nexistence has she experienced?\r\n\r\nDuring these early years there was also separation from and loss of\r\nclose loved family members. When I was three and a half a great aunt who\r\nalways appreciated my side of things moved out of our home due to a\r\nfamily argument. Perhaps most confusing of all during these preschool\r\nyears, at four and a half, my father died suddenly. \"They\" said that he\r\nwent to heaven, that God called him. Why did he go? Why would he leave\r\nus? Most important how could he leave me? What had I done wrong? Was it\r\nthat I had not loved him enough? Been good enough to him? Was he angry?\r\nWhat kind of God is God, anyway? Is he benevolent, malevolent,\r\nindifferent? Is he real: is he believable? What can one expect and how\r\nshould one act toward authority and power? The world didn't feel like a\r\nvery safe place nor did persons appear to be dependable.\r\n\r\nThen there was school. With additional authorities and peers there arose\r\nnew wonderment and expectation. The way one was to be in school was\r\n{43} different from at home. And what was happening at home while I was\r\nat school? Could I depend on things being safe? In kindergarten I made\r\nan ash tray of clay for my already dead father.\r\n\r\nIn my child world there were books, radio, and the movies. Today\r\nchildren experience these, as well as television and record players. For\r\nme, books, radio, and the movies brought into my world new aspects of\r\nfear, excitement, joy, love, horror, violence, imagination, and\r\nsuspense. They depicted at times the ideal and at times the abysmal.\r\nSometimes, despite everything, good triumphed. At other times regardless\r\nof the effort invested all was lost. Where was the harmony of logical\r\nreason? Is our world absurd? Are we absurd to respond to it with an\r\nexpectation of reason?\r\n\r\nFor each child there are very special, long-remembered events: being\r\ntaught to swim by one's father, family picnics, trips into the world\r\nbeyond city or country, going to the circus, a world's fair, a zoo or a\r\nfantasy land. There, also are the events of being loved and loving\r\ndeeply, linked somehow with times of feeling unloved and unloving.\r\n\r\nMore than earlier, today there are multiple community groups for\r\nchildren where activities are guided and supervised. Within these\r\nsituations and in the free play of neighborhood children, there is\r\nalways the confusing, enlightening, and frequently distorted information\r\ngained through discovering your relationship with both boys and girls.\r\nExploration by children into their sexual similarities and differences,\r\na healthy pursuit, in the past more than today often aroused parental\r\nfuror. Furor and different reactions from different involved parents\r\nlead to further child confusion and focus.\r\n\r\nWithin childhood peer relations there are games, play, and schoolwork\r\nthat allow the child to come to know personally the meanings and\r\nfeelings of competing, collaborating, fighting, winning, losing,\r\ndestroying, building, aggression, passivity, constriction, freedom, and\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\nThen there is adolescence with all its moodiness, questions, fears, and\r\nexperimenting related to adult modes of being. The moods are a mystery\r\nand the questions often unanswerable or the answers contradictory.\r\nNorman Kiell in _The Universal Experience of Adolescence_ says that as\r\nadults we forget the intensity, turmoil, and concretes of this period\r\nand that perhaps we have to.[7] Yet, it is not possible that the\r\ninstability and discomfort of spirit lived in adolescence does not leave\r\nits ingrained tracing as part of our eternal presents.\r\n\r\nWhen the focus of our responsibility shifts from play to work, during\r\nthese early years of becoming, depends on our particular circumstances\r\nand abilities. For most persons there is a tipping of the balance\r\nbetween these. Hopefully neither extreme is the master. Fortunately, in\r\nmany instances, as the child's work as been to play; the adult's work\r\nworld, his world of responsibility is lived, experienced by him, to an\r\nextent as play--it gives satisfaction and pleasure.\r\n\r\n{44}\r\n\r\nSome adults select another and are chosen by this other for a sharing of\r\ntheir worlds. Some go it alone. Some procreate new beings; some create\r\nin other ways; some give-take and exist; some just lean. These last\r\nappear to be, and yet to not be, \"all-at-once.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMAN BECOMES EVER MORE\r\n\r\nBuber perceives man becoming more through his human capacity to relate\r\nto other being in all forms from the materialistic to the spiritual in\r\n\"I-Thou,\" \"I-It,\" and \"We\" ways.[8] Gestation, with the closeness of\r\nmother and child, has left man with an ingrained knowing of the\r\nexperience of closeness. Thus, throughout man's life his condition of\r\nexistence is affected by and desires relationship with and closeness to\r\nother being. The closeness of the conditions of gestation is never again\r\npossible, hence existential loneliness. Yet because of this prenatal\r\nexperience Buber conceives of man as born with a \"Thou\"--another--before\r\nhe is conscious of himself, his \"I.\" With growing consciousness he sorts\r\nout his \"I\" from his \"Thou.\" You can see the late infant doing, acting\r\nthrough, this separation. During this growing phase, often to the\r\ncare-taking adult's frustration, he repeatedly, intensely, and excitedly\r\nthrows his toys or bottle out of the crib, carriage, or playpen. Often\r\nhe runs away from his \"Thou,\" his parental security source, to a safe\r\ndistance with intense awareness of what he is doing. While internalizing\r\nthese and subsequent \"Thous\" as part of his \"I,\" his knowing place,\r\nparadoxically, he sorts out who he is, and who and what is other than\r\nhimself. So with ever more relationship, ever more experience, he\r\nbecomes ever more the person he has the human capacity to be. He becomes\r\nmore through his relations with others, never the same as these others,\r\nthough he does internalize these others as part of himself.\r\n\r\nBuber describes \"I-Thou\" relating, man merging with otherness, as always\r\nnecessitating an \"I,\" a man, capable of recognizing self as at a\r\ndistance, apart from otherness. Therefore, his \"I-Thou\" relating, a\r\nmerging of beings, is not like the psychological defense, unconscious\r\nidentification. Buber's \"I-Thou\" relating emphasizes awareness of each\r\nbeing's uniqueness without a superimposing, or a deciding about the\r\nother without a knowing. Such relating is a turning to the other,\r\noffering the other authentic presence, allowing the authentic presence\r\nof the other with the self, and maintaining one's capacity to question.\r\nIt is not then identification or an idealization of the other. Within\r\nthis mysterious happening of \"I-Thou\" relating, when both participants\r\nare human, each becomes more. Buber refers to the event of this merging\r\nof otherness, of man with other being, as \"the between.\" Humanistic\r\nnursing is concerned with \"the between\" of nurses and their others.\r\nTheir others, the {45} microcosms of their communities, would be\r\npatients, patients' families, professional colleagues, and other health\r\nservice personnel.\r\n\r\nBuber describes man's ability to come to know and relate in \"I-It\" as\r\nman looking back, reflecting on his past \"I-Thou\" relations. Looking\r\nback these \"I-Thou\" relations are viewed as an object to be known, as\r\n\"It\". \"I-It\" relating allows man to interpret, categorize, and accrue\r\nscientific knowledge.\r\n\r\nFinally man relates with others as \"We.\" This permits the phenomenon of\r\ncommunity and of adult unique contribution. So man becomes through\r\nrelating with family, others, and community, like Hesse's onion or a\r\nbeing who actively moves toward ever more integuments, qualities,\r\nthreads, and complexity.[9] Many unique contradictory type beings, then,\r\nhave influenced the becoming of each individual human person. In a sense\r\neach unique person might be viewed as a community of the beings with\r\nwhom he has meaningfully related in struggle and/or complementariness.\r\nIn fact Buber talks of thinking man as a dialogue of internalized\r\n\"Thous.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMUNITY: NURSING\r\n\r\nIf each man can be likened to a community of his internalized \"Thous,\"\r\nlogically think of the outcome of many men struggling together\r\nsupposedly for a common purpose. Since time began, man in community has\r\nbeen experienced by man as chaotic. Thus Plato wrote _The Republic_.[10]\r\nThis presentation depicted an impossible scheme for developing an ideal\r\ncommunity. As a classic, _The Republic_ continues to be a thought\r\nprovoking thesis. Its antiquity makes one realize that this desire to\r\ncontrol, our continued concern with genetic planning, is a part of the\r\nvery nature of man. And yet, considering man's ever existing recognition\r\nof the chaos of community how naive we often behave, for example,\r\nenraged at experiencing _another_ communication break.\r\n\r\nPlato envisioned regulating and controlling almost every dimension of\r\nthe individual's existence in accordance with his particular potential\r\nfor development to fulfill the needs of his ideally conceptualized\r\ncommunity. Today Heinlein, a science fiction novelist, still writes of\r\nbreeding for longevity in man, as we breed animal stock for the greatest\r\namount of meat and profit.[11] Giving Plato his due, he recognized at\r\nthe end of his book concern and doubt as to whether men so carefully\r\nmated and reared would fulfill their designated responsibilities. He\r\nwondered if things could, would, or would not go in accordance with his\r\nplan. He then logically indicated the process and kinds of community\r\ndeteriorations which could ensue. Plato had a concept of an ideal\r\ncommunity, of ideal types of necessary men, and of ideal male-female\r\nbreeding relationships. He viewed our present-style family as one that\r\nsaps the {46} strength of community and does not support this concept.\r\nHe conceived of communal living more like the communal living of our\r\npresent-day communes. However, Plato's communes would have been\r\nregulated by the plan as he conceived it. Existence in these communes\r\nwas to be predetermined and very determined.\r\n\r\nNursing, though not generally the ruling force of this type of planning,\r\ncertainly is involved in control measures analogous to Plato's. Nurses\r\ndo influence who gets the hospital bed and who does not, who gets the\r\nspecialized treatment and equipment, who is discharged and when, and\r\nwhat goes into the education and planning for post-hospital health care.\r\nAlso, how do our biases influence our teaching regarding family?\r\nInnuendoes are frequent in the areas of birth control, abortion, and\r\nfamily size. So nurses can make a difference regarding community\r\nthought, purpose, and action.\r\n\r\nNietzsche put forth a concept of community of a more indefinite nature\r\nthan Plato's.[12] Two major themes dominated the nature of community in\r\nhis conception: (1) the legitimate purpose of community was the total\r\nsupport of its elite men and (2) the criterion for determining the elite\r\nwas to be based on those who selected their own values with a \"will\" to\r\nsay, \"yes\" to life. He referred to his elite as supermen. He questioned\r\nthe realization of such a community because of the preponderance of\r\nconforming nonquestioning mediocre men. This complacent majority fearful\r\nof the different or strange would subdue the possibility of his\r\nsupermen. Nietzsche did not seem to trust man; he spoke of him as\r\n\"human, all too human.\" Unlike Plato, Nietzsche viewed \"good\" and \"evil\"\r\nas arising from a common source. Man in his humanness, Nietzsche felt,\r\ndenied his animal heritage and animal qualities. Recognition of these,\r\nof one's Dionysian nature, as a source of both \"good\" and \"evil\" was\r\nnecessary for becoming superman.\r\n\r\nTo me it is wondrous to ponder my own conscious purposefulness and\r\nunconscious purposelessness, my quality of force as a member of the\r\nnursing and health communities, viewed through the deep extensive\r\nconceptualized thought Nietzsche bequeathed. I offhand consider our\r\ncommunities as egalitarian, part of a larger egalitarian society. Are\r\nthey really? Does the citizen affect the quality of organizational\r\nstructure in accordance with his existential needs while in our\r\ncommonplace--the health-nursing world? Whose values set and direct on\r\nthis stage of life? Do I, nurse, search out the values on which I want\r\nto base my nursing practice? Do I look for direction and values from\r\nothers? Did I take on values during my initial nursing experience--values\r\nnever to be reexamined?\r\n\r\nWithin the nursing community are there nurses eagerly noncomplacent and\r\ndesirous of looking at, of sharing their explorations, and of\r\ndetermining and choosing the values that they want to underlie their\r\nnursing practice? {47} Would supernurses be allowed to be the mediocre\r\nmany? Who would determine the elite of the nursing community? Could\r\nsupernurses survive without approval of their being different? Would\r\nthey be strengthened by the fruits of suffering in their struggle within\r\nthe profession? Would these fruits of suffering contribute\r\nconstructively to the strengthening of the nursing community?\r\n\r\nBuber, like Nietzsche, sees man-in-community with possibilities for\r\nevolving, being, and becoming more. Buber trusts each man as a unique\r\npotential involved in an ongoing struggle with his fellows directed\r\ntoward a center.[13] His nonstatic, nonselected community where men\r\nbecome in and through ongoing struggle with each other expresses the\r\nreality of my nursing world. Who would expect a community without\r\nstruggle if they accepted each man as his history inclusive of\r\nantecedents that go back to beginnings of man's consciousness and of\r\nanticipations that go forth into this man's notions of eternity?\r\nConsidering the complexity of each man's being and becoming, it is\r\nsurprising that we come to understand each other in community at all,\r\nrather than the reverse.\r\n\r\nHow can we hope for a sustained thereness, presences of nurses with\r\nother man (patients, patients' families, professional colleagues, and\r\nother health service personnel) as \"We\" in an ongoing struggle of\r\ncommunity considering their multitudinous differences? Norman Cousins,\r\nin _Who Speaks for Man_, comments on man's inability to respond\r\naffirmatively to those he experiences as different from himself.[14] For\r\nthe human community to progress he suggests federation. A unity in which\r\ndifferences would be valued as promoting thought, human evolvement, and\r\ncommunity advancement. Cousins gives examples of man's inhumanity to man\r\nbased on differences viewed as nonvalues. The prevalence of this latter\r\nview of differences is very evident in our commonplace health-nursing\r\nworld. Can nurses and other health care maintainers look at the ways\r\nthey respond to differences consciously, and can they deliberately\r\nchoose to be open to responding to them as valuable? Can we conceive of\r\nthere being value in that which we see as \"not right,\" \"untrue,\"\r\n\"wrong?\"\r\n\r\nThe ability to be there, to stay involved in community with my fellows,\r\nis a problem worthy of concern to me as a nurse. How do I stay in an\r\nexistential way with my contemporaries, patients, patients' families\r\nwhen their values in reality are so different from my own? How do I go\r\nbeyond a negative judgmental to a prizing attitude that would open the\r\npossibility of seeing strengths in others' views perhaps lost,\r\ndiscarded, or never previously existent in my own? Nonsuperimposing of\r\nmy own value system through recognizing and bracketing it is a difficult\r\nprofessional goal. And yet, a goal that if coupled with the courage for\r\npersonal existence, could sustain me in the health-nursing community.\r\n{48}\r\n\r\nSo for a health-nursing community to truly be actualized each nurse\r\nwould prepare to be all it was possible for her to be as a nurse. Then,\r\nthrough exploration there would be a recognition of the reality of the\r\nexistent community. Over time a merger of the values of the nurse and of\r\nthe existing community would be reflected as moreness in each. The nurse\r\nwould be more through her relation with the community; the community\r\nwould be more through its relation with the nurse. Each would make an\r\nimportant difference in the other. The macrocosm, the community, would\r\nreflect the nurse's quality of presence. The microcosm, the nurse, would\r\nreflect the presence of the community with her. Each unique man becomes\r\nin community through communication with other uniquely different men.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Plato, _The Republic_, trans.

What condition\r\nof humanness is necessary in the nurse for the actualization of\r\nnursing's research potential? This chapter will attempt to share some\r\nbrooding and mulling on this problem.\r\n\r\nNurses practice within ever-moving, changing settings where formulated\r\nplans frequently and suddenly go awry. Unexpected patient needs arise.\r\nPowerful others make both reasonable and unreasonable demands. Depended\r\non others fail us due to human frailty or lack of dependability. The\r\nnurse's setting, her researchable area, is the extreme opposite of her\r\ncolleague's, the laboratory investigator's. Her area is beyond research\r\ncontrol measures. Too, it lacks the quiet isolated atmosphere conducive\r\nto contemplation and creative thinking associated with research.\r\n\r\nConversely, it is oversaturated with the \"stuff\" of meaningful\r\nexistence. It can stimulate questions to the frenzy of immobilization.\r\nThe human nurse's system can become overloaded. Such overloading\r\nreflects the humanness of the nurse; like all man she can envision\r\npossibilities beyond any human being's ability of fulfillment.\r\n\r\nNurses know there are events in their commonplace worlds that scream for\r\nhuman interpretation, understanding, and attestation. The question\r\nbecomes \"how.\" This \"how\" depends on more than concretes and events in\r\nthe nurse's setting. This \"how\" depends on relevant \"ifs.\" The\r\nmeaningfulness of the nursing world will be actualized conceptually \"if\"\r\nthis is supported by institutional economic and administrative planners,\r\nother nurses, and intradisciplinary colleagues. For knowledge available\r\nand visible to nurses in the health setting to be preserved,\r\nconceptualized for durability, it needs to be valued by the\r\ninstitutional health community. Still, most necessary to its duration is\r\nthe appreciating of this knowledge by the nurse, herself. {52}\r\n\r\n\r\nHUMAN CONDITION OF BEING: NURSE RESEARCHER\r\n\r\n\r\nInitiation of a Nurse Researcher\r\n\r\nThe nurse student, recently arrived in her experiential world, is awed\r\nwith the need to be cognizant of multitudinous factors. At this initial\r\nintroductory phase one could say her \"being\" as a nurse is programmed or\r\nimprinted with: It is your responsibility to report and attend all the\r\nthings that influence the response and comfort of those for whom you\r\ncare. This programming supports and is supported by any already existing\r\ntendencies within the nurse student toward unrealistic, perfectionistic\r\nexpectations of self.\r\n\r\nThen in research courses, usually positivistically geared, her\r\nprogramming jams. Her system is fed: Select out, isolate, focus down on\r\na single question, limit your variables, establish a protocol of\r\noperation, control for reliability and validity, tunnel your vision, and\r\nsafeguard objectivity. The jamming is the result of the human nurse's\r\ncapacity to see relationships between the part and the whole. Human\r\nintelligence, as a condition of humanness, demands this relating of one\r\nthing to another. Often such relating is intuitive, human, based on much\r\nthinking for purposes of understanding and solution. Yet, often it\r\ncannot be substantiated fully and conceptualized logically at specific\r\ntimes, therefore it is subjective.\r\n\r\nTo highlight the obvious in the above I attempted facetiousness. Many\r\nnurses acutely aware of the complexities, contradictions, and\r\ninconsistencies of their nursing worlds have struggled and used the\r\npositivistic method in research studies. Hence, they have isolated a\r\nresearchable question, stated their basic assumptions, hypothesized\r\noutcomes, selected samples, established experimental and control groups,\r\nformulated methodologies, searched out and utilized appropriate\r\nfindings, and have made recommendations. Usually these research efforts\r\nhave advanced scientific knowing and knowledge of existents within the\r\nhealth-nursing situation. And yet, often these efforts have discouraged\r\nthe research wonderment of the nurse interested in the nature and\r\nmeaning of the nursing act and how the event of nursing is lived,\r\nexperienced, and responded to by the participants. These positivistic\r\nresearch methods have made available answers. Still, they have not\r\nanswered the questions most relevant to nursing practice and to nurses.\r\n\r\nThese nurses were certain that man generally could not be prescribed for\r\ninterpersonally; he was not predictable, not yet an automaton. Faced\r\nwith alternatives men often surprised. Consequently these positivistic\r\napproaches to studying human events, unless one forced one's data\r\ncrowbar style, always terminated with a kind of miscellaneous category.\r\nMan's undeterminedness makes him all-at-once frustrating to study,\r\nimpossible to distinctly categorize, and excitingly mysterious and the\r\nmost worthy focus of nursing research. {53}\r\n\r\n\r\nA Nurse Researcher's Presence in the Nursing-Health Setting\r\n\r\nThe existent, a nurse labeled researcher, in the health world brings a\r\ndisquiet that has to be understood and endured. Necessities for\r\nscientific study in the nurse's world of the nursing event or situation\r\nare wonderment, concern, and responsibility. Open adherence to such\r\nqualities frequently startles others into speculating about the\r\nresearcher. She, herself, becomes an oddity. Persons ponder the\r\npossibility of her study's having a hidden agenda that involves them.\r\nOver time these persons generally accept or reject the searcher's\r\nefforts. If rejected the searcher is often labeled a worthless nosey\r\ntroublemaker. Subtly it is conveyed among those involved that she is to\r\nbe interfered with often by mechanisms of ignoring or forgetting or\r\nrighteously setting \"patient's needs\" above conforming to the study\r\nplan. For instance, how often have research nurses met with responses\r\nfrom staff at the time of their planned arrival on a unit to work with a\r\npatient, \"Oh, he seemed to need activity, he was restless, I forgot you\r\nwere coming, I sent him to the gym,\" or \"Oh, (surprise) did you want to\r\ngive the patient his morning care? That was done a while ago; we give\r\ncare early.\" If accepted the searcher is often labeled an interested,\r\ninteresting person whose efforts are to be fostered because her findings\r\nwill enhance situation nursing. The distinction frequently is based in\r\nstaffs' responses to the searcher's personality more than in the value\r\nof the issues of the investigation.\r\n\r\nSignificant to negative staff responses toward a nurse searcher is the\r\nnecessity for her to withhold information. This withholding may be\r\nnecessary to protect the study results. For example, it is necessary\r\nwhen a special type of patient care is being tested against usual\r\npatient care or when confidentiality is an issue. Confidentiality\r\nrequires a nurse, searcher or not, to censor communications when\r\npersonal knowledge of individuals make them identifiable. The need for\r\nconfidentiality can be determined by the nurse's considering the\r\nknowledge gained in view of whether it will or will not influence the\r\nover-all treatment plan. If it will affect the plan, there is reason to\r\nreveal it; then it must be related in a manner that insures the\r\npatient's continued protection and, if possible, with his permission. If\r\nover-all treatment is not influenced, one must censor the knowledge\r\ngained to check one's own free communications. Would the patient want it\r\nrevealed; is it knowledge of a quality that brings ridicule, is looked\r\nat negatively or nonacceptably in our particular culture generally? Is\r\nit of a sensitive nature and therefore knowledge we do not just reveal\r\nto anyone?\r\n\r\nOther patient care givers may sense this withholding by the nurse\r\nsearcher. They may reasonably accept it or unreasonably not accept it.\r\nThe researcher may or may not be aware of or concern herself with her\r\ncolleagues' sensitivity. This would depend on the searcher's usual modus\r\noperandi and on the importance she associates with her colleagues' sway\r\nin her investigation. The latter can be much greater than is obvious.\r\n{54}\r\n\r\n\r\nConfidentiality--Description: Humanistic Nursing\r\n\r\nHumanistic nursing practice theory proposes phenomenology, a descriptive\r\napproach to participants in the nursing situation as a method for\r\nstudying, interpreting, and attesting the nature and meaning of the\r\nlived events. Humane nursing is not humanistic nursing within this\r\ntheory unless that which becomes visible to the nurse in the nursing\r\nsituation is shared in a durable form with colleagues.\r\n\r\nConfidentiality, then, becomes an important issue in humanistic nursing.\r\nNo scientific methodology of research is affixed with \"ought\" or\r\n\"should\" virtues regarding knowledge gained. In nursing, a professional\r\nhelping realm, a practitioner or researcher is wed to \"ought\" and\r\n\"should\" virtues. The knowledge gained \"ought\" to be dispersed to\r\ncolleagues for their increased understanding. It \"should\" enhance the\r\nconstructive force of the profession. To so enhance it \"must\" be\r\ncommunicated in a manner that allows understanding while protecting\r\ndistinct individuals and groups. Words and conceptualized ideas are the\r\ntools of phenomenology. Protection of distinct persons and meaningful\r\ncommunication can be augmented through the utilization of abstractions,\r\nmetaphors, analogies, and parables. So humanistic nurses, as\r\npractitioners and researchers, are inherently responsible for their\r\nmanner of being, responding, and consciously sculpturing knowledge into\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\r\nResponsibility When Sharing: Understanding of Man\r\n\r\nHow does a nurse searcher, who wonders, notices, relates, and comes to\r\nknow, become humanly responsible? Nietzsche's philosophical works would\r\ndirect a nurse searcher to look at her values. The values known through\r\nlooking at what determines her actual behavior considering how these\r\nvalues correlate with her privilege of calling herself, nurse. Empathy,\r\nknowing how another experiences, when coupled with the title, nurse,\r\ndictates a performance that encompasses no harm to others and hopefully\r\nbenefits them. Despite the human excitement of discovery, disciplined\r\neffort and rigorous evaluation enter into preparing knowledge of man for\r\ndispersal. Revelation should not merely shock; rather, professionally we\r\nuse shock to awaken surprise, a fundamental, for human constructive\r\nmovement toward moreness. The former, mere shock, needs to be guarded\r\nagainst. The latter, shock to awaken surprise needs to be exactingly,\r\nuncompromisingly attended for the communicability of knowledge and the\r\nactualization of the phenomenon, nursing.\r\n\r\nIn considering confidentiality and the quality of knowledge of man\r\navailable to me, as nurse, my consciousness is confronted with my former\r\nmentor, and internalized \"Thou,\" Paul V. Lemkau, M.D., psychiatrist. He\r\n{55} emphasized repeatedly that the professional person, as he\r\nincreasingly understands man, should take on increasing responsibility\r\nto man, one's self and one's others. Buber says, \"As we become free ...\r\nour responsibility must become personal and solitary.\"[1] One can extend\r\nthis and say that to help others struggle for freedom one must realize\r\nthat others must responsibly decide and that although they do this\r\nthrough and in the authentic presence of a nurse, these others are alone\r\nin deciding. And nurses in deciding what and how to convey of their\r\nknowing must decide freely, responsibly, personally, and alone.\r\n\r\nThe nurse in deciding what and how to convey, considering the\r\nprofessional necessities of both confidentiality and dispersion of\r\nknowledge, can be guided by a conception of the nature of\r\nman-in-his-world. Man in humanistic nursing practice theory is viewed as\r\na conflictual, contradictory, inconsistent dilemma. One horn of the\r\ndilemma is ideal spirituality that wrestles against the other horn,\r\nprotective materialistic animalism. This \"all-at-once\" struggling,\r\nstretched, mixed nature of man needs recognition. Recognition of man's\r\nnature, as such, supports greater self-acceptance. Self-acceptance and\r\nthis view of man-in-his-world, like a magnifying glass, unmasks for a\r\nnurse her possible responses, motivations, and alternatives. Cognizant\r\nof these, she can responsibly select what knowledge to disperse to\r\nprotect individuals and to continually shape and conceptually actualize\r\nthe nursing profession. Utilizing this magnifying glass on self in\r\nhumanistic nursing practice theory to let one's existing mixed, varied,\r\nstruggling responses, motives, and alternatives into self-awareness is\r\nan axiom referred to as authenticity with self.\r\n\r\nAcceptance of the others' human nature or human condition of being is\r\nusually easier than acceptance of our own. Usually each man is his own\r\nseverest judge. Lilyan Weymouth, R.N., clinical specialist, my past\r\nteacher and present friend, in sympathetic moments, speaking of\r\nsuffering others, often says, \"the poor devils.\" Once, feeling anxious\r\nand annoyed, I responded, \"we are all poor devils.\" She retorted, \"I am\r\nglad you recognize that.\" Stopped short, I found myself continuing to\r\nponder the phrase, \"poor devils.\" Man's dilemma is that he is neither\r\nsaint nor devil. He is a \"poor saint\" and a \"poor devil,\" and by his\r\nnature he is pushed and pulled in both directions, \"all-at-once.\" Our\r\nhuman existence in the world calls for an enduring with our virtues and\r\nvices, our energy and our laziness, our altruism and our selfishness, in\r\na word with our humanness.\r\n\r\nWhat meaning does this conception of man have for humanistic nursing\r\npractice theory? This theory necessitates a nurse who accepts and\r\nbelieves in the chaos of existence as lived and experienced by each man\r\ndespite the shadows he casts interpreted as poise, control, order, and\r\njoy.\r\n\r\nLabeled mental patients in therapeutic situation, in the sun beyond the\r\nshadows, express how they set themselves apart from the rest of the\r\ncommunity {56} of man. They express how they experience themselves.\r\nThey view themselves as the worst, the noblest, the unhappiest, the most\r\nmaligned, and the most afraid. It comes out as if these superlative\r\ndistinctions are their only claims to fame. In my humanness I appreciate\r\nthe awesome dreads they live. They need to know that they exist in their\r\nunique distinctness. And yet, the separation and loneliness with which\r\nthey adorn themselves and which professionally we have fostered with\r\nfear engendering diagnostic labels seem a heavier than necessary burden.\r\nIn the light of existential loneliness, a part of each human existence,\r\noften I invite them to see themselves as not so unlike other men and as\r\nsuffering the turmoil of existence as part of the human community, such\r\nas it is. One usually can note their surprise and disbelief of my view.\r\nThen, momentarily at least, tension seems to visibly fall from their\r\nfaces and forms. When this idea of them is heard by them, its effect\r\ncorresponds to how I experienced the technique in sensitivity group of\r\nliterally being allowed to dance into what felt like the circle of man,\r\nour group.\r\n\r\nTo hear opportunities for humanistic nursing acceptance and support\r\nnurses, too, need to question their self-nurse-image within the nursing\r\nand health community. Do they know that they make and have real\r\npotential for making a difference, an important difference? Do they\r\naccept themselves as nurse? To me, a nurse is a being, becoming through\r\nintersubjectively calling and responding in her suffering, joyous,\r\nstruggling, chaotic humanness, always trying beyond the possible while\r\nnever completely free from ignoble personal human wants. And, through\r\nher presence it is possible for other persons to be all they can be in\r\ncrisis situations of their worlds. For the nurse to be humanistic it is\r\nnecessary for her to live her human condition-in-her-nursing-world\r\nproudly with all its vulnerability and all its wonders. As man, the\r\nnurse can recall and reflect on her \"I,\" on her past \"I-Other\"\r\nexperiences, and she can come to know and accept more and more of\r\nherself, as she becomes more. In humanistically recalling and reflecting\r\na nurse will understand and respond empathetically and sympathetically\r\nto both her own humanness and the other's. She will recognize both self\r\nand other as \"poor devil\" and \"poor saint,\" all-at-once.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a nurse denies her own struggling humanness, she\r\nself-righteously will be apt to accuse either self or her other. This\r\nway of being denies, suppresses, and represses one's own and the other's\r\nability to be, to be as much as potentially possible. Understanding man\r\nthrough this conception of him is important to the possibility of\r\naugmenting the implementation of humanistic nursing practice theory.\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthenticity With The Self: For Actualization of Nursing's Potential\r\n\r\nHusserl, the father of phenomenology, suggested the study of our lived\r\nworlds, our experience, a return to the study of \"the thing itself.\"\r\nLooking at the lived worlds of nurses one is confronted with conflicts\r\nand multiple {57} values. In their nursing worlds nurses often risk\r\nthemselves in their commitment to good for their patients. They come to\r\nknow aspects of their own and others' unique natures. These are often\r\ndifferent from and frequently in conflict with generally accepted\r\ncultural values and/or institutional policies and rules. If\r\nconfidentiality is an issue, does this dictate a suppression of nurses'\r\ncomplete knowing? Or does this call for a recognition of as complete a\r\nknowing as possible followed by responsible selection and revelation of\r\nthat knowing which will advance knowledge and understanding of man?\r\nUnderstanding of man can change a person's way of being with other man\r\nand his way of existing in and responding to his world. I suggest the\r\nlatter, as complete knowing as possible followed by responsible\r\nselection and revelation, with occasional risk taking to deepen the\r\nlevel of accepted cultural knowledge of man. Always, the nurse would\r\nprotect an individual other man. This dispersion of knowledge, then,\r\nrequires not only responsible being in the nursing situation but also\r\nmulling, pondering, assessing, and judging prior to disclosure.\r\n\r\nAs complete a knowing as possible, in humanistic nursing refers to its\r\naxiom, authenticity with the self. When I, nurse, respond in the arena\r\nof my lived nursing world, I respond to a particular person in this\r\n\"here and now\" with all my background and all my anticipation of the\r\nfuture. By respond, I do not mean to indicate that I overtly\r\ndeliberately communicate or verbalize my total response. Rather I mean\r\nthat I strive for _awareness_ of my total response within myself to a\r\nparticular person in a particular \"here and now\" viewed through my\r\nparticular past and anticipated future. It is a struggle to grasp how I\r\nperceive and respond within all my capacity of human beingness. To\r\nattain the highest possible level of authenticity with the self requires\r\nlater recollection of ongoing perceptions of the other and reciprocal\r\nresponses, selected communications, and actions by the self. These\r\nrecollections now become raw data available for analyzing, questioning,\r\nrelating, synthesizing, hypothetically considering, and ongoing\r\ncorrecting. Sometimes sharing such recollections with a trustworthy\r\nconfidant (clinical specialist, consultant) for purposes of reality\r\ntesting is helpful. Often this can broaden the professional meaning base\r\nI attribute to both my perceptions and my responses. On return to the\r\narena of my nursing world I then verify my perceptions. I can let the\r\nother know how I perceived his actions and be open to his further\r\nexpression of how this world is for him. In professional nursing this\r\nkind of experiencing, searching, validating, utilizing of one's human\r\npotential capacity must be based in the ideals on which nursing rests.\r\nPrimarily for me, I see myself, nurse, as comforter or being nurse in\r\nsuch a way that my other is helped to be all that he can humanly be in\r\nthis particular \"here and now\" considering his unique potential.\r\n\r\nSo, being authentic with the self, is not an acting out of a nonthought\r\nthrough response or merely a doing of what one feels like doing. Rather\r\nit is the very opposite of this. It is a thought through responsible\r\nchoosing of overt response based in knowledge and on nursing values. It\r\nmust correspond positively with one's belief that searching and sharing\r\nin one's nursing world will promote both the nursed and the nurse to be\r\nmore. If it is merely a {58} peeking in on, an exploitation of the\r\nother, for selfish learning purposes, it desecrates the very concept of\r\nnursing. One has the broad human potential of feeling like doing many\r\nthings, all-at-once, that extend into all kinds of living. And this is\r\ntrue in, as well as outside, a nurse world. In recollecting and\r\nreflecting on perceptions and responses in all these extremes one\r\nbecomes freer to select from within one's self the values to be chosen,\r\nactualized, and potentiated in one's nursing practice. Authenticity with\r\nthe self calls forth confrontation of the self with one's motivations\r\nand alternatives. This permits a purposeful selection and an aware\r\nactualized overt response based on one's nursing value criteria artfully\r\ntailored to a particular situation.\r\n\r\nI consider each nurse a scientific-artist: classical, modern, primitive,\r\ncubic, or interpretive. My inference here is that we express artfully in\r\naccordance with our uniqueness. Many nurses given the same data would\r\naccomplish with the same or a similar degree of adequacy through use of\r\ntheir particular distinct selves. Therefore, though the function called\r\nfor might be the same, each nurse would approach the function and the\r\npatient differently. How one actualizes the result of thinking, and\r\nbeing authentic with one's self recalls what Jung said about art.\r\n\r\n     \"Art is a kind of innate drive that seizes a human being and\r\n     makes him its instrument. The artist is not a person endowed\r\n     with free will that seeks his own ends, but one who allows art\r\n     to realize its purpose through him. As a human being he may\r\n     have moods and a will and personal aims, but as an artist he is\r\n     \"man\" in a higher sense--he is \"collective man\"--one who\r\n     carries and shapes the unconscious, psychic life of\r\n     mankind.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThrough the years, over and over, I have met nurses so driven,\r\nmotivated, and expressive in their nursing worlds.\r\n\r\nI called this section \"authenticity with the self: for actualization of\r\nnursing's potential.\" In it I have been trying to say, the more of\r\nourselves we are able to awarely include, the more of the other we can\r\nbe open to and with. A capacity for presence with others allows us to\r\nshare ourselves. Through this sharing others become more. They are able\r\nto internalize us as \"Thou.\" This happening occurs in the reverse, too,\r\nand we become more.\r\n\r\nIn a nursing situation the quality of being authentic with the self is\r\nto be striven for. It is a taking advantage of and appreciating of our\r\nhuman ability and spirit. It fosters our pursuit of inquiry, improves\r\nour caring for others, the contributing of our unique knowing, and it\r\nallows us to shape ever further a scientific-artistic profession of\r\nnursing.\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthenticity With the Self: Potentiated in Lived Experience\r\n\r\nThis example is offered to support the claims for authenticity with the\r\nself made in the last paragraph of the prior section.\r\n\r\n{59}\r\n\r\nAs clinical supervisor and thesis advisor to a young graduate nursing\r\nstudent in her twenties the benefits of authenticity with the self were\r\nagain brought home to me. She was taping her therapy sessions with two\r\npatients. These taped materials were to become her thesis data.\r\n\r\nOne of her patients was not much younger than herself. The other was a\r\ndivorced woman in her forties, around my age. This young graduate\r\nnursing student was receiving clinical nursing supervision as a\r\nnecessity in her particular situation not by personal choice or\r\nawareness of need.\r\n\r\n>From the onset of her clinical supervision with me I was aware that it\r\naroused her feelings about dependence. At her age this had meaning since\r\nshe was still struggling for independence and interdependence. This is a\r\ndifficult time. Her response to me was \"respectful,\" sweetly and\r\nunawarely hostile, and she made it apparent that I was another nurse\r\nauthority to be appeased, manipulated, and outsmarted. This behavior had\r\nbeen successful for her with past authorities. She was bright and had\r\nbeen able to complete intellectual requests and assignments at the last\r\nminute with little effort. During the initial phase of our relationship\r\nawareness of her struggle, her difficulties and her assets, allowed me\r\nto maintain a supportive kind of being with her.\r\n\r\nIn listening to her therapy tapes I realized that another clinical\r\nsupervisory approach was called for. She was defending against relating\r\nto her older patient by behaving toward her as she probably felt toward\r\nher own mother, and often toward me. Also, she was defeating her\r\ntherapeutic purpose with her younger patient by viewing her as if the\r\npatient were herself. The older suicidal, depressed patient was begging\r\nher for an understanding therapeutic relationship. She needed terribly\r\nto share her suffering. This woman did not need a \"rejecting daughter\"\r\nworking hard to outwit her. The younger patient needed to share her\r\nangry feelings and sense of worthlessness.\r\n\r\nThrough the tapes and through weekly sessions with the graduate student,\r\nI came to know and understand her existing nursing situations. At this\r\ntime neither the student's need to understand nor the patients'\r\ntherapeutic needs were being met. The student, too, was aware of this in\r\na sort of suppressed way. Indirectly, in responding to her patients,\r\nknowing I would be listening to the tape she would take a \"sweet swipe\"\r\nat me which placed the responsibility of all our efforts on my\r\nshoulders. So if there were no beneficial outcomes, obviously the blame\r\ncould be placed.\r\n\r\nDuring the initial phase of my relationship with the graduate student\r\nand during the initial phases of her relationship with her patients I\r\ncame to understand. I listened, got into the rhythm of these other\r\nspirits, reflected on what I had come to know, and out of this\r\nexperience assessed and planned.\r\n\r\nLater, taking what I had come to know, as just how it was for all of us,\r\nI shared my knowing with the graduate student and budding first-rate\r\ntherapist. Together we explored the implications of the above. She\r\nbecame invested, involved, and excited about herself becoming more. We,\r\nmyself and each of her patients, become for her more whom we essentially\r\nwere. Most important to her and to me, this graduate student grew in her\r\nrecognition and acceptance {60} of herself and her ability as an adult\r\nnurse therapist. The thanks and meaningful praise she received from both\r\nher patients on termination of therapy made this apparent. It brought\r\ntears to both her eyes and mine. I felt joy in being with a\r\nnow-respected colleague, as opposed to the earlier being with a person\r\nwho felt like an unasked for \"awe struck defensive daughter.\"\r\n\r\nAuthenticity with myself, and this graduate student's ability for\r\nauthenticity with herself allowed these patients' progress to occur. It\r\nallowed a realistic articulation in this student's phenomenological\r\nmaster's thesis of her lived nurse experience. From such articulation\r\nwill a theory and scientific-artistic profession of nursing ever mold,\r\nflow, and form.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORDS DISTINCTLY HUMAN: LIMITING, YET HUMANIZING\r\n\r\nThrough words we humanly share the meaning to us of our behavior,\r\nexperience, and profession. Words attest to and endure. Thus, a\r\nprofessional history is possible, accrues, and has lasting duration. The\r\nstudy of the nursing event itself and its conceptualization as proposed\r\nin humanistic nursing practice theory is an application of\r\nphenomenology. Articulation of our perspective, experience, and ideas is\r\nthe human way of phenomenology.\r\n\r\nWords are symbols to which man gives meaning as an outgrowth of his\r\ncivilization within his culture. Through words man attempts to\r\ncommunicatively describe his experienced states of being-in-his-world.\r\nIn describing, of necessity, he relegates his uniquely known experiences\r\nto already known word symbols or categories. Thus, the conceptualized\r\nexperience is limited, or less real than the lived unique experience.\r\nSo, while words prevent the loss of the wisdom of lived experience, they\r\nare both a wonder of humanness and a limitation of humanness.\r\n\r\nIn describing human experiences there are efforts that can cut back this\r\nlimitation. If we truly wish to convey meaning to others, really want to\r\nshare what we have experienced in living, we will put forth the effort.\r\nTo put forth such effort requires going beyond \"I must publish to\r\npublish.\" It takes writing, structuring, rewriting, and restructuring\r\noften to a point where for a period one comes to hate materials he once\r\nheld dear.\r\n\r\nThrough the years many of us come to use words as a means of passing a\r\ncourse, or we view words as a mode for self-explosion, expression, and\r\nself-understanding. In these ways they hold much purpose. The\r\nrequirement that words convey unique experiences of being to others\r\ndemands much more. This necessitates one selecting words that depict\r\none's perspective, his unique human angular view; or depict for another,\r\nthis particular man as he perceives and responds to his unique\r\nexperience. Such a depiction has to be unknown to the other; each one's\r\nvantage point, given his history as an existent in this time and place,\r\nis singular. Then it requires finding words and putting them {61}\r\ntogether in a way that best conveys the meaning the nursing event had to\r\nthe nurse. An adequate dictionary and thesaurus can be useful.\r\n\r\nThe actual presentation of experience for an audience demands an\r\nordering of data in a sequence that will be sensibly logical for them.\r\nWe live experience in an order that flows from our being and history\r\nwithin a multiplicity of calls and responses. Presently human expression\r\nis limited to sequentiality. So again we see that the conceptualized\r\nexperience is different from and lacks the reality of the uniquely lived\r\nevent. Structuring a logical sequential presentation of data, deciding\r\non those aspects that influenced meaning, and having it conform as\r\nclosely as possible to the real is difficult.\r\n\r\nOften, when it seems that one has done his very best, it is wise to have\r\na trusted other react to conceptualizations. Another's questions can\r\nbring to the conceptualizer's awareness thought connections that moved\r\nhim along and that he has failed to convey. Also, such a reader can\r\nindicate aspects of thought trips the writer took that add nothing to\r\nthe issue at stake and weaken his message. Too, another's response can\r\nmake apparent to a writer the need to clarify meaning. This\r\nclarification may merely entail a better choice of words or phrases, or\r\nit may suggest the use of a meaningful metaphor, analogy, or parable.\r\n\r\nThese last imaginative forms of expression we frequently use\r\nmeaningfully, sometimes like a shorthand, with our intimates. A phrase,\r\nmetaphor, or analogy conveys with an immediacy the quality or spirit of\r\nan event. For example, a nurse working in a psychiatric hospital unit\r\nspeaking of a patient said, \"He came down the hall looking like an\r\naccident about to happen.\" A page of technical description could not\r\nhave given me as much feeling for what she and the patient were\r\nexperiencing at that moment. In nurses' efforts to express objectively,\r\nscientifically, and eruditely such modes of expression are often deleted\r\nfrom our written professional works. It is as if we enforce the rules of\r\nmedical record charting of precision, conciseness, and use of \"weasel\"\r\nwords onto all our written works to the detriment of a theoretical and\r\nprofessional enduring body of nursing knowledge being actualized. It\r\ntakes considerable pain and endeavor to find egress from such human\r\nprogramming. With it we have purified, equalized, wearied, and\r\ndehumanized supreme experiences of human existence. And, we have negated\r\nthe meaning and importance of ourselves and nursing. How often have you\r\nheard, \"I am _just_ a nurse\"?\r\n\r\nPhenomenology requires rigorous investment into respectfully,\r\nappreciatively, and acceptingly making evident our lived worlds and\r\ntheir ramifications for the now, the past, and the anticipated future.\r\nNursing literature of this caliber would call and inspire those who\r\nattended it to further nursing practice and responsibly share the\r\nmeaning they attribute to their area of specialized dedication.\r\n\r\nThe raw data of our lived nursing worlds do not easily reveal their\r\nmeanings or messages. Many see their worlds only superficially, and\r\nthemselves as mere functions. How often a nurse is surprised,\r\nconfounded, on hearing a relative or friend speak of a nursing event in\r\ntheir lives that may have occurred {62} from 10 to 40 years previously.\r\nFrequently persons express appreciation for the meaning these events\r\nhave had for them through the years. They remember the pleasure, anger,\r\npain, fear, and/or joy they experienced.\r\n\r\nIt is not loose performance that allows raw data to convey its message\r\nto a nurse. New data are sucked easily and immediately into old, worn\r\nout, known theoretical frames and networks of words. Severe\r\nself-discipline enters into describing nursing experience with the vigor\r\nof how it was lived. Too easily the description is let fall to mediocre\r\ncommon forms. Proper grammar and plain English should suffice. This\r\nwould carry the nursing message, as jargon borrowed from other\r\ndisciplines in which the nurse always speaks as an alien, never will.\r\nHumanistic nursing practice theory in asking for description does not\r\nask one to forget or deny known terms and knowledge. Rather it asks for\r\na bracketing or holding of this knowledge to the side. The nursing\r\nexperience should be given an opportunity to be seen in its pure form,\r\nrather than forcing it to conform to foreign prestigious terms borrowed\r\nfrom other areas of specialization, which beg the meaning of the nursing\r\nevent. Prior to dispersion, of course, one should weigh one's expression\r\nin English against one's expression in one's known foreign jargon. Then\r\none will be open to choose how one wants to express and share the\r\nmeaning of her nursing world.\r\n\r\nPhenomenology accepts categorization as a necessity of communicating. It\r\nholds, nevertheless, that this is secondary to initial aware\r\nexperiencing. This study method acknowledges the unfathomable complexity\r\nof existing and knowing. It strives for as adequate conceptualization of\r\nthe existential experience as possible. It honors the knowing person's\r\ncontinued capacity for surprise and wonderment. Phenomenology asks us to\r\ngo beyond the common labels to the surprise of our own and other's\r\nunique existences-in-the-world. A nurse who had been struggling over\r\nmany months with a family in their home, on the day she first\r\nexperienced an \"I-Thou\" relationship with them said, \"It was as if I had\r\ngone beyond the uncooperativeness and dirtiness of the situation.\"\r\nImmediacy in labeling offers us the complacency and security of a\r\nwrapped up problem. How could a nurse be held responsible for what\r\nhappened to a \"dirty,\" \"uncooperative\" family. The many commonly heard\r\nlabels humans attribute inhumanely to others rarely relate to answers in\r\nsituations or to the dreadful human suffering problems generate.\r\n\r\nPhenomenology seeks attestation of the meaning of a situation to a\r\nparticipant. Positivism seeks general objective categories within the\r\nuniversal. Phenomenology prizes differences, variations, and struggles\r\nfor their representation as parts of the whole. Rather than emphasize\r\nthe majority as holding sway, it recognizes that the unique contribution\r\ncan possibly be the weightiest in meaning. {63}\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROCESS: BECOMING A FREE RESPONSIBLE RESEARCH NURSE\r\n\r\nFor a nurse to become a free responsible research nurse in the health\r\narena she accepts her lived nursing world as beyond the controls valued\r\nin positivistic science. She appreciates her lived nursing world as\r\nsaturated with knowledge to be extracted or wrung. Then she must\r\nexamine, recognize, appreciate, and unfold her history, her angular\r\nview, and her human nurse potential. In prizing her view, as nurse, she\r\nwill ask relevant nursing questions. To attain her potential as nurse\r\nshe will discipline herself rigorously for authenticity with the self.\r\nWith the self-acceptance that comes with self-authenticity she will know\r\nthe importance of the difference she and the nursing profession make and\r\ncan make in the community of man. Then out of her own human social need\r\nand for the survival of nursing she will describe to propel knowledge,\r\nnursing theory, and practice forward. In this process and in its effects\r\nshe will become more human as she contributes to man's humanization.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Martin Buber, _Between Man and Man_, trans.

Therefore, the methodology presented in\r\nthis chapter is relevant to humanistic nursing practice theory.\r\n\r\nEmbraced within this chapter is a methodology for studying nursing that\r\nevolved out of the process of my nursing practice. The logic of this\r\nmethod and of my process of nursing are one. It is not a method of\r\nanother discipline superimposed on nursing. So this method did not force\r\nnursing or change nursing to have it mold or conform. As this method\r\nunfolded it arose from and in accord with nursing process. This\r\nmethodology came into being only after years in which various attempts\r\nwere made to get positivistic methodology to answer relevant nursing\r\nquestions and to develop a professional scientific theory of nursing.\r\n\r\nThe method presented here was used initially to creatively conceptualize\r\nnursing constructs in 1967-68. The data for the development of the\r\nconstructs \"comfort\" and \"clinical\" were gathered from my clinical\r\nnursing practice and while I was deeply engrossed in existential\r\nreadings. The process or method used was not conceptualized until it was\r\ncalled for while writing my doctoral dissertation in 1968. It had then\r\nbeen used to study the clinical literary works of two psychiatric mental\r\nhealth nurses, Theresa G. Muller and Ruth Gilbert.[1] Its\r\nconceptualization at that time was rudimentary. Gradually it has been\r\nfurther conceptualized. \"From a Philosophy of Nursing to a Method of\r\n{66} Nursology,\" an article published in _Nursing Research_ in 1972,\r\nwas my next attempt.[2] Graduate nursing students studied this article\r\nand repeated the process of the methodology in their studies of their\r\nclinical nursing data. Reflecting on this article and realizing how\r\nothers had to study and struggle with it. I became aware that still only\r\nthe bare bones of my thinking were presented. Further elaboration of\r\nthis methodology was called forth to share it with the _humanistic\r\nnursing practice theory_ course participants. Since 1970 I have delved\r\ninto phenomenologists' writings and at this time can say that this\r\nprocess of studying nursing is a phenomenological method of nursology.\r\nInteresting to me is that the initiation of this method came when I\r\nfirst began to read the existentialist literature. Existentialism can be\r\nviewed as the fruits of phenomenological study. The process of this\r\nmethod has become clearer and clearer to me over time. Phenomenologically\r\nthe process or method has grown out of the reality of the \"thing itself\"\r\nto be studied, in this case, clinical nursing practice.\r\n\r\nThis chapter then is the result of reflecting on these past efforts and\r\nis a conceptualization of this method as I understand it now.\r\n\r\nThe following quote is offered to support and validate the efforts put\r\ninto conceptualizing this method. The philosopher of science Abraham\r\nKaplan says of methodology:\r\n\r\n     \"The aim of methodology ... is to invite speculation from\r\n     science and practicality from philosophy ... to help us\r\n     understand in the broadest possible terms, not the products of\r\n     scientific inquiry, but the process itself.\"[3]\r\n\r\nThe above quotation expresses the spirit in which this presentation is\r\noffered. Positivistic science aims at objectivity and its results are\r\nviewed as scientific facts. Nursing practice has been understood by many\r\nas an implementation of such theoretical facts. Considering my and other\r\nnurses' implementation of such facts it is apparent that in these\r\nendeavors nurses come to know much about human existence.\r\n\r\nPhilosophy is often viewed as man's contemplations, autobiographical\r\nrevelations, and the values and belief systems that underlie man's\r\nactions, Can an explicit philosophy of nursing allow for more meaningful\r\nquality practice, be a resource for nurses, improve service, be\r\navailable for reexamination, correction, and the forwarding of\r\nknowledge? If nursing practice is viewed as the implementation of\r\nscientific facts and what they call forth in the nursing situation\r\nrelated to man's condition of existence, is a heuristic science of\r\nnursing developed from this situation, by nurses, an appropriate\r\npractical professional aim?\r\n\r\n{67}\r\n\r\nThis presentation is my answer, a committed \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nThe method offered here, a phenomenological method of nursology, aims at\r\nthe reality of man, how he experiences his world, or it aims at a\r\nsubjective-objective state. It aims at description of the professional\r\nclinical nursing situation which in reality is subjective-objective\r\nworld that occurs between subjective-objective beings. The description\r\nfocuses on this between and preserves the complex mobile flow of the\r\nriver of nursing to make apparent that superficial precise portrayals\r\nare only an overlay of its river bed, course, and eventual destinations.\r\n\r\nThe relevance of phenomenological nursology ranges from the formulation\r\nof nursing constructs to the creation of theoretical propositions. It is\r\napplicable to one's own clinical data and to others' clinical data, here\r\nand now, or in historical study of the literature.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGICAL STARTING POINT\r\n\r\nThis method addresses itself to the question: How can a nurse, a\r\nsubjective-objective human being know self and the other and compare and\r\ncomplementarily synthesize these known betweens?\r\n\r\nBasic to this method is a belief system, a philosophy about the nature\r\nof man explicitly commented on by thinkers throughout human history.\r\n\r\nPlato said:\r\n\r\n     \"I cannot be sure whether or not I see it as it really is; but\r\n     we can be sure there is some such reality which it concerns us\r\n     to see.\"[4]\r\n\r\nNurses are with other men in times of peak life experiences under the\r\nmost intimate circumstances. We, too, can not be certain about what we\r\ncome to know in our betweens. We can be sure that these realities of\r\nhuman experience are worthy of exploration. Our opportunities are\r\nunique, only we can describe man in the nursing situation.\r\n\r\nIn _Let Us Now Praise Famous Men_, James Agee voices a similar concern\r\nabout the need to describe man-in-his-world and the adequacy of human\r\ndescription.[5] Aware of the wonders and complexities of man he\r\nconsiders not trying to describe worse than the inadequacy of\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nThinkers have also acknowledged that we can come to know from others. A\r\npoem by Goethe expresses an attitude about this:\r\n\r\n    \"Somebody says: 'Of no school I am part,\r\n    Never to living master lost my heart;\r\n    Nor anymore can I be said\r\n    To have learned anything from the dead.'\r\n    {68}\r\n    That statement--subject to appeal--\r\n    Means: 'I'm a self-made imbecile.'\"[6]\r\n\r\nIn nursing what better master than the nursing situation in which we\r\nbecome through our relations with others. Each human person has\r\nsomething unique to teach us if we can but hear.\r\n\r\nAbout our inadequacies of expression, many things are, are true,\r\n\"all-at-once.\" The law of contradiction does not apply\r\nin-the-lived-experienced-world. We each view the world through our\r\nunique histories. Wisdom is many sided truth. Wisdom cannot be expressed\r\n\"all-at-once.\" Truths can be stated only in sequence or metaphorically.\r\nIf I were supercritical of my human limitations to express \"all-at-once\"\r\nwisdom, I would say nothing. Jung points up the dangers of this, he\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     \"I must prevent my critical powers from destroying my\r\n     creativeness. I know well enough that every word I utter\r\n     carries with it something of myself--of my special and unique\r\n     self with its particular history and its particular world.\"[7]\r\n\r\nEach nurse's uniqueness dictates then a responsibility to share her\r\nparticular knowing with fellow struggling human beings. Only through\r\neach describing can there be correction and complementary synthesis to\r\nmovement beyond.\r\n\r\nThe nurse's world is an experiential place for becoming influenced by\r\neach participant's \"here and now\" inclusive or origin, history, and\r\nhopes, fears, and alternatives of the confronting future. Positivistic\r\nscience focuses on selected particulars. Henri Bergson says:\r\n\r\n     \"... for us conscious beings, it is the units that matter, for\r\n     we do not count extremities of intervals, we feel and live the\r\n     intervals themselves.\"[8]\r\n\r\nEach human participant in the nursing situation has a unique flow of\r\nconsciousness which is intersubjectively influential.\r\n\r\nSo as human nurses we are limited in our ability to express the reality\r\nof our-lived worlds. Yet, also, this world depends on and demands that\r\nwe, as human nurses, give it meaning, understand it in accordance with\r\nour {69} humanness. Will and Ariel Durant, historians, professionals\r\nwho are forced to selectively present the world for other humans, say:\r\n\r\n     \"The historian will not mourn because he can see no meaning in\r\n     human existence except that which man puts into it: let it be\r\n     our pride that we ourselves may put meaning into our lives, and\r\n     sometimes a significance that transcends death.\"[9]\r\n\r\nHumans are the only beings conscious of themselves. Nurses are human\r\nbeings. As such we are capable of looking at our existence, choosing our\r\nvalues, giving our world meaning and of constantly transcending\r\nourselves, or becoming more. If we value and prize our human nursing\r\nworld and our human potential for consciousness and expression, we will\r\nactuate our potential and conceptualize our human nurse-world. This\r\nsuggests questions to me. What do I want nursing to be? How can I\r\ninfluence the meaning of the term, nursing? How committed am I? What\r\ninvestment am I willing to make? Will I risk exploring and saying what I\r\nsee in my nursing world? Am I open to knowing? How can I actuate my\r\nuniqueness to allow the realistic potential of my nursing profession to\r\nbecome, become ever more? Am I contributing my \"nursing here and now\" to\r\nnursing's history through a lasting form of expression? Of what\r\nimportance is what I think or say; do I make any difference? Hermann\r\nHesse says of each man's uniqueness:\r\n\r\n     \"... every man is more than just himself; he also represents\r\n     the unique, the very special and always significant and\r\n     remarkable point at which the world's phenomena intersect, only\r\n     once in this way and never again.\"[10]\r\n\r\nOr, a nurse might say:\r\n\r\n     \"... every nurse is more than just herself, she also represents\r\n     the unique, the very special and always significant and\r\n     remarkable point at which the nursing world's phenomena\r\n     intersect, only once in this way and never again.\"\r\n\r\nTo me, human freedom means recognizing our unique potential,\r\nresponsibility, and limitations. Our singularity as a nurse among\r\nnurses, then, confronts us with a responsibility that belongs to one\r\nelse. Martin Buber, philosophical anthropologist says:\r\n\r\n     \"As we become free ... our responsibility must become personal\r\n     and solitary.\"[11]\r\n\r\nOur unlikeness to other nurses is a lonely, very person conditioned\r\nstate. Only each nurse can be responsible for herself. The wonders of\r\nfreedom are {70} paradoxically, \"all-at-once,\" both a delight and a\r\nburden. In nursing it is important for us to understand freedom not as\r\nopposing or agreeing: freedom is choosing--choosing and saying \"yes\" to\r\none's self.\r\n\r\nHuman endeavor between man and men in their-worlds, in this instance\r\nprofessional clinical nursing, if explored and described is viewed as\r\ncontributing to man's human evolvement and to knowledge of the human\r\ncondition and how man becomes.\r\n\r\nIntegrally all the above statements are the bases and biases of this\r\nhuman phenomenological method of nursology. In a phrase, I suppose what\r\nall these _starting point_ statements say is: Nursing situations make\r\navailable human existence events significantly worthy of description.\r\nOnly human nurses can describe them. Humans' ability to describe reality\r\nadequately has its limits. We should describe since pridefully we humans\r\nare the only existing beings capable of giving meaning to, looking at,\r\nand expressing our consciousness. In the long run this effort could\r\nyield a nursing science.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHASES OF PHENOMENOLOGIC NURSOLOGY\r\n\r\nPhase I: Preparation of the Nurse Knower For Coming to Know\r\n\r\nThis method engages the investigator as a risk taker and as a \"knowing\r\nplace.\" Risk taking necessitates decision. Decision imposes confronting\r\nambivalence in one's self. The ambivalence of wanting to be\r\n\"all-at-once\" responsible and dependent. Superimposing an already\r\naccepted and acceptable structure on data is safe feeling. Approaching\r\nthe situation or data openly, letting the structure emerge from it, not\r\ndeciding what to look for, being willing to be surprised, give feelings\r\nof excitement, fear, and uncertainty. There exists the possibility that\r\nour humanness may include the dilemma of our not being able to perceive\r\nthe messages of our data, that we will not be able to merge with it and\r\nbecome more. The question arises, Are we knowing places that can relate\r\nto otherness and intuitively synthesize knowledge? This process of\r\naccepting the decision to approach the unknown openly is experienced as\r\nan internal struggle and we become consciously aware of our rigidity and\r\nsatisfaction with the status quo. Conforming to the usual, in this case\r\npositivism, gives a security that is not easily relinquished despite the\r\nadvantages of actualizing our unique responsible freedom.\r\n\r\nRussell's metaphorical phrase, \"windows always open to the world,\"\r\ndepicts the sought state of mind. His elaboration on this phrase gives\r\nthe flavor of the process of preparing the mind. He says, \"Through one's\r\nwindows one sees not only the joy and beauty of the world, but also its\r\npain and cruelty and ugliness, and the one is as well worth seeing as\r\nthe other, and one must look into hell before one has any right to speak\r\nof heaven.\"[12] Pain, cruelty, ugliness, hell seem appropriate words to\r\nconvey seeing our {71}long-cherished ideas and values, our security\r\nblankets, as only false gods. Nietzsche in speaking of confrontation of\r\none's values said, \"And now only cometh to him the great terror, the\r\ngreat outlook, the great sickness, the great nausea, the great\r\nseasickness.\"[13] So this human methodology seeks a condition of being\r\nin the investigator. The investigator must be aware of her own angular\r\nview and democratically open to giving the angular views apparent in the\r\ndata, the called for representation.\r\n\r\nThe first phase of this method of research correlates well with the\r\nstruggle experienced by me in clarifying my approach to patients in\r\npublic health, medical-surgical, and psychiatric mental health\r\nsituations. In these situations, one truly has to struggle with\r\ndemocratically keeping one's windows open to the world. And this is a\r\ncontinual process. Having experienced this struggle in clinical nursing\r\nmade this approach to research valid and meaningful to me.\r\n\r\nPreparing the mind for knowing in clinical or research endeavors may be\r\naccomplished by several means. One means is by immersing one's self in\r\ndramatic and literary works and contemplating, reflecting on, and\r\ndiscussing them as they relate to the knower's already known, in this\r\ncase, nursing practice. In clinical or research nursing the selection of\r\nliterary works to stimulate the opening of one's human view is based on\r\ntheir presentation, depictions, and descriptions of man's nature. In\r\nliterature authors share their thoughts as men and present possible ways\r\nmen may view and relate to their worlds.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhase II: Nurse Knowing of the Other Intuitively\r\n\r\nBergson conceives of man knowing through a dilatation of his imagination\r\ngetting inside of, into _le durée_, into the rhythm and mobility of the\r\nother. Living the rhythm of the other he believes results in an\r\nabsolute, intuitive, inexpressible, unique knowledge of the other. He\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n     \"... an absolute can only be given in an intuition, while all\r\n     the rest has to go with analysis.\"\r\n\r\n     \"... from intuition one can pass on to analysis, but not from\r\n     analysis to intuition.\"\r\n\r\n     \"... fixed concepts can be extracted by our thought from the\r\n     mobile reality; but there is not means whatever of\r\n     reconstituting with the fixity of concepts the mobility of the\r\n     real.\"[14]\r\n\r\nThe known, clinical nursing practice, gave meaning to the above for me.\r\nOver the years in nursing conferences I had been told my grasp of\r\nnursing situations was intuitive. Most times this was offered rather\r\ndisparagingly although the nursing outcomes were most times successful.\r\nAlong with having {72} the attribute of intuition assigned to me\r\npersons often asked, \"Why are you so fascinated with other persons'\r\nsituations?\" Together these relate to Dewey's view of intuition. He\r\nviews intuition as a mulling over of conditions and a mental synthesis\r\nthat results in true judgments since the controlling standards are\r\nintelligent selection, estimation, and problem solution.[15] In nursing\r\npractice research knowing the other and how he experiences and views his\r\nworld is viewed as the problem.\r\n\r\nKnowing intuitively, as described by Bergson, is comparable to Buber's\r\nconsiderations of man's necessary mode of becoming through \"I-Thou\"\r\nrelation. The criteria Buber describes as characteristic for \"I-Thou\"\r\nrelation are subscribed to in my approach to nursing practice and in\r\nthis human or phenomenological nursology approach.[16] Buber held as\r\nprerequisite for intuitive type knowing of the other, or imagining the\r\nreal of his potential for being, a knower, and \"I,\" capable of distance\r\nfrom the other, able to see the other as a unique other, one who turns\r\nto the other, makes his being present to the other, and allows the other\r\npresence. The knowing, \"I,\" in this case the nurse, responds to the\r\nother's uniqueness, does not superimpose, maintains a capacity for\r\nsurprise and question, and is with the other, as opposed to \"seeming to\r\nbe.\" This kind of relating cannot be superimposed on a nurse clinician\r\nor researcher. It must be personally responsibly chosen and invested in.\r\n\r\nThe approach then of the second phase of this method and of the\r\ntransactional phase of nursing when nurses are in the arena with others\r\nis the same. This method proposes that to study nursing from outside the\r\narena for purposes of objectivity bursts asunder the very nature of\r\nnursing practice. The studier is a part of that which is being studied.\r\nObservations interpreted from outside the situation could be classified\r\nonly as projections.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhase III: Nurse Knowing the Other Scientifically\r\n\r\nBergson believes man knows incompletely through standing outside the\r\nthing to be known, metaphorically walking around it, and observing it.\r\nThis analytical process, this viewing of a thing's many aspects, he\r\nconceives as the habitual function of positive science. This is the\r\nthird phase of this phenomenological nursology method. Bergson says:\r\n\r\n     \"... analysis multiplies endlessly the points of view ... to\r\n     complete the ever incomplete representation.\"\r\n\r\n     \"All analysis is thus a translation, a development into\r\n     symbols, a representation taken from successive points of\r\n     view.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Analysis ... is the operation which reduces the object to\r\n     elements already known, that is, common to that object and to\r\n     others.\"[17]\r\n\r\n{73}\r\n\r\nSo phenomenological nursology proposes that after the studier has\r\nexperienced the other intuitively and absolutely, the experience be\r\nconceptualized and expressed in accordance with the nurse's human\r\npotential. Humanly we can express only sequentially while our actual\r\nexperienced lived worlds flow in an \"all-at-once\" fashion. Our words are\r\nknown symbols and categories used to convey the experience and thus deny\r\nthe uniqueness of each realized experience.\r\n\r\nBuber's description of man's \"I-It\" way of relating to the world is in\r\nagreement with Bergson. He conveys the necessity of this kind of\r\nrelating by man to his world; and despite its lacks proposes that man\r\nprize his analytical ability. Like Bergson, Buber views knowing as a\r\nmovement from intuition to analysis, and not the other way around. Buber\r\nsees knowledge expressed or science created through the knowing \"I\"\r\ntranscending itself, recollecting, reflecting on, and experiencing its\r\npast \"I-Thou\" relation as an \"It.\" This is man being conscious of,\r\nlooking at, himself and that which he has taken in, merged with, made\r\npart of himself. This is the time when he mulls over, analyzes, sorts\r\nout, compares, contrasts, relates, interprets, gives a name to, and\r\ncategorizes.\r\n\r\nThe third phase of this methodology is the same as that phase of\r\nclinical nursing practice in which the nurse, removed from the nursing\r\narena, replays and reflects on this area and transcribes her angular\r\nview of it. In this reflective state the nurse analyzes, considers\r\nrelationships between components, synthesizes themes or patterns, and\r\nthen conceptualizes or symbolically interprets a sequential view of this\r\npast lived reality. The challenge of communicating a lived nursing\r\nreality demands authenticity with the self and rigorous effort in the\r\nselection of words, phrases, and precise grammar.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhase IV: Nurse Complementarily Synthesizing Known Others\r\n\r\nIn this phase of the methodology the nurse researcher, the knower,\r\ncompares and synthesizes multiple known realities. Buber says of\r\ncomparison:\r\n\r\n     \"The act of contrasting, carried out properly and adequately,\r\n     leads to the grasp of the principle.\"[18]\r\n\r\nIn this comparison and synthesis the \"I\" of the researcher assumes the\r\nposition of the knowing place. The knower, like an interpreter, allows\r\ndialogue between the multiple known realities. These realities are\r\nunknowable to each other directly. The knower interprets, sorts, and\r\nclassifies.\r\n\r\nIn the human knowing place discovered differences in similar realities\r\ndo not compete, one does not negate the other. Each can be true,\r\npresent, \"all-at-once.\" Differences can make visible the greater\r\nrealities of each. Desan, the philosopher, says of this kind of\r\nsynthesis:\r\n\r\n{74}\r\n\r\n     \"... a synthetic view where two or more positions are seen to\r\n     illuminate and to transfigure one another through their mutual\r\n     presence.\"[19]\r\n\r\nThe knower alert to an aspect present in a single reality can question\r\nthe other reality on this aspect. This aspect may be present in both,\r\nmore blatant in one than in another. Its forms may be different or\r\nmodified in each. It may be totally absent in one. Differences found may\r\narouse or bring to consciousness other questions to ask of the data.\r\nThis oscillating, dialectical process continues throughout reflection on\r\nthe multiple realities. This indirect dialogue is recorded by the\r\ninvestigator as the complementary synthesis.\r\n\r\nThis synthesis is more than additive because it allows mutual\r\nrepresentation and the illumination of one reality by another.\r\n\r\nThe fourth phase of this research methodology is like that phase of\r\nclinical nursing in which a nurse compares and synthesizes the\r\nsimilarities and differences of like nursing situations and arrives at\r\nan expanded view.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhase V: Succession Within the Nurse From the Many to the Paradoxical\r\nOne\r\n\r\nThis phase of phenomenological nursology is highly probable if not\r\nabsolutely necessary. Desan says:\r\n\r\n     \"Truth emerges in and through the relational operation. For the\r\n     way of paradox is the way of truth.\"[20]\r\n\r\nThe investigator may struggle with the multiplicity of views now\r\nconsciously part of and within herself. Again Desan:\r\n\r\n     \"... this unrest \"is\" the mind of man, reaching its center....\r\n     From this center the splendor of multiplicity is visible.\"[21]\r\n\r\nThe researcher, mulling over and considering the relationships between\r\nthe multiple views, insightfully corrects and expands her own angular\r\nview. This is not a right-wrong type of correction. Such correction\r\nwould amount only to an ongoing eternal recurrence of a frustrating\r\nnature. Rather this correction takes the form of ever more\r\ninclusiveness. Struggling with the communion of the different ideas the\r\nknower takes an intuitive leap, through and yet beyond these ideas, into\r\na greater understanding. She then may come up with a conception or\r\nabstraction that is inclusive of and beyond the multiplicities and\r\ncontradictions.\r\n\r\nThis inclusive conception or abstraction is an expression of the\r\ninvestigator in her here and now, with the old truths and the novel\r\ntruths, none obliterated.\r\n\r\n{75}\r\n\r\nThe fifth phase of this phenomenological nursology method can be equated\r\nto that phase of clinical professional nursing in which the nurse\r\npropels nursing knowledge forward. In this phase a nurse struggling with\r\nthe mutual communion of multiple nursing situations arrives at a\r\nconception that is meaningful to the many or to all. From the specific\r\nconcrete ideas of the many situations she moves through dilemma to\r\nresolution which is nursing expressed abstractly in units or as a whole,\r\nas one.\r\n\r\nExperiential knowledge of nursing, years in which I came to know self\r\nand the other while implementing scientific facts, allowed me as a\r\nknower to recognize the relevance of this philosophical nursology\r\nmethod. This method does not aim at conventionality. Rather it strives\r\nto meaningfully augment and share conceptualized nurse-world realities.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Josephine G.

Just as the meaning of humanistic nursing is found in\r\nthe existential intersubjective act, that is, in the dialogue as it is\r\nlived out by nurse and patient in the real world, so the theory of\r\nhumanistic nursing is formed, in the dialogical interplay of articulated\r\nexperiences shared by searching, abstracting, conceptualizing nurses.\r\n\r\nThe theory of humanistic nursing originates from and is continually\r\nrevitalized and refined by actual nursing experience. But each nurse, as\r\na unique human being, necessarily experiences the nursing dialogue and\r\nher nursing world in a unique way. So the development of humanistic\r\nnursing theory rests on the sharing of individual unique angular views.\r\nAnd the theory as a totality will become richer, more consonant with\r\nreality, as it represents more and more nurses' views.\r\n\r\nSo often nurses, even nurses who know that their clinical expertise grew\r\nout of their practice, hesitate to share their nursing experiences. They\r\nare apt to say deprecatingly, \"Oh, that's _only_ my _personal_\r\nexperience.\" Yet that is precisely where the value lies, in the\r\nuniqueness of human experience. Since each nurse's description of her\r\nnursing experience is a glimpse of a real nursing world, the views\r\ncannot justifiably be judged as right or wrong; they simply are. Once\r\nthe various views are expressed, they can be compared and contrasted,\r\nnot for the purpose of accepting some and rejecting others but rather in\r\nthe interest of clarifying each in relation to the other. Such a\r\ndialogue of experientially based conceptualizations can result in a\r\ncomplementary synthesis. The process calls for not only a true\r\nappreciation of personal experience by each nurse but also commitment to\r\na collaborative effort of open sharing by a genuine community of nurses.\r\n\r\nThis view, that the development of humanistic nursing practice theory is\r\na dialogical process, has led to our valuing (in fact, insisting on) the\r\ndescription {78} of nursing phenomena. We see phenomenological\r\ndescription as a basic and essential step in theory building. Indeed,\r\nconsidering the \"state-of-the-art\" of nursing theory development, it is\r\nthe most crucial and immediate need.\r\n\r\nLooking back at the historical evolvement of our humanistic nursing\r\napproach, it is obvious that we had been using and developing a\r\nphenomenological approach for a number of years before we graced our\r\nefforts with the impressive label, \"Phenomenological Psychiatric Mental\r\nHealth Nursing,\" in a course offered to a group of nurses at Northport\r\nVeterans Administration Hospital in April 1972. Although we were aware\r\nmuch earlier that our interests and work were flowing in the general\r\nstream of phenomenology, we usually refrained from using the label\r\nbecause it did little to clarify our position.[1] The term has grown\r\nless precise with the extension of its use in different disciplines and\r\nwith variations in methodology.\r\n\r\nWhen we began applying the term \"phenomenological\" to our work, we\r\nlearned that to many persons it sounds strange, unpronounceable,\r\nforeign; to some forbidding; to others enticing. We later coined the\r\ntitle \"humanistic nursing\" as being more suitable for it encompasses our\r\ngeneral existential bent. However, this change in title does not imply\r\nany abandonment of our phenomenological approach. The description of\r\nnursing phenomena is as highly prized now as ever. In humanistic\r\nnursing, phenomenological and existential currents interrelate. Having\r\nan existential view of nursing as a living dialogue influences which\r\nphenomena one becomes aware of, experiences, values, studies, and\r\ndescribes. Reciprocally, as one discovers and struggles to describe and\r\ndevelop meaningful ways of describing nursing phenomena, the lived\r\nnursing dialogue itself will be continually perfected.\r\n\r\nIt is more precise to speak of phenomenological methods (in the plural)\r\nrather than phenomenological method (in the singular), for, since Edmund\r\nHusserl's original work, the approach has been used by different\r\ndisciplines. With its spread there has developed a corresponding\r\nvariation in methodology. This, in a sense, is the beauty of\r\nphenomenology: it thrives on variety of perspective; it allows, perhaps\r\nrequires, individual creativeness; it is always open. In this spirit,\r\nideas are offered here with the hope of stimulating imaginative,\r\ncritical response, and further development of methodology.\r\n\r\nThis chapter considers some of the more concrete details of\r\nphenomenological methodology as they relate to humanistic nursing. The\r\ngeneral approach and procedures discussed below have been used,\r\nindividually {79} and collaboratively, by Dr. Josephine Paterson and\r\nmyself with individual and groups of nurses to explore and describe\r\ntheir nursing experiences. They have helped nurses in various levels and\r\ntypes of nursing service to take a fresh look at their practice and make\r\ndesirable changes. We have lived through the process with graduate\r\nstudents in nursing, and it has led both the students and us to new\r\nconceptualizations and reconceptualizations of nursing phenomena. We\r\nhave found this to be a fruitful research method when applied to\r\nclinical nursing phenomena personally experienced and/or reported in the\r\nliterature. And we are currently exploring its potentials with\r\ninterested nurses at Northport Veterans Administration Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PHENOMENOLOGICAL APPROACH\r\n\r\nThe method may be characterized generally as descriptive but it is not a\r\nsimple cataloguing of qualities or counting of elements. Basically, it\r\ninvolves an openness to nursing phenomena, a spirit of receptivity,\r\nreadiness for surprise, the courage to experience the unknown. Equally\r\nimportant is awareness of one's own perspective and of personal biases.\r\nThe methodological process is subjective-objective and intuitive-analytic.\r\nBesides subjective knowing or personal experiencing of the phenomenon,\r\nrigorous analysis also is required. This being-with (subjective,\r\nintuitive knowing and experiencing) and looking at (objective analyzing)\r\nthe phenomenon all at once sparks a creative synthesis, a\r\nconceptualization from which emanates insightful description.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the method entails _an intuitive grasp of the\r\nphenomenon, analytic examination of its occurrences, synthesis, and\r\ndescription_. In actuality, as the method is carried out, one does not\r\nnecessarily recognize or focus on these processes as distinct phases or\r\nsteps. In the flow of the experience, at times, some seem to occur\r\nsimultaneously or in oscillation. Bearing this in mind, the processes\r\nwill be considered in more detail.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntuitive Grasp of the Phenomenon\r\n\r\nPhenomenology is grounded in experience. It values the raw data of\r\nimmediate experience. (\"To the things themselves,\" was the slogan that\r\ninspired and guided Husserl and his followers.) So this approach\r\nrequires, in the first place, attitudes of openness and awareness. It\r\ninvolves learning to become conscious of spontaneous perceptions, or in\r\nother words, getting in touch with one's sensations and feelings. It\r\nmeans capturing prereflective experience, that is, becoming aware of\r\none's immediate impression or response to reality before labeling,\r\ncategorizing, or judging it.\r\n\r\nIn this kind of a state of readiness to receive what appears, a\r\nphenomenon may be grasped intuitively. It is as if a particular bit of\r\nreality, a happening, flashes _impressively_ into one's awareness. The\r\nintensity of the experience and the absorption of one's attention in the\r\nphenomenon vary over a wide range. There may be only a fleeting\r\nrecognition of a phenomenon accompanied by {80} a half-formulated\r\nthought or judgment, such as, \"hmm, that's interesting,\" with immediate\r\ndismissal from or replacement of it by something else in one's\r\nconsciousness. The impression may, of course, be stored in memory and\r\npop out again at a later time. Or the phenomenon may strike on one's\r\nconsciousness more forcefully causing further pondering and wonder. Or\r\nthe impression of the phenomenon may be so startling that it fills one's\r\nconsciousness to the point of pushing all else out; a person is\r\nmomentarily \"stopped in his tracks.\"\r\n\r\nIn the intuitive grasp, regardless of its intensity or duration, the\r\nphenomenon appears clear and distinct. The intuitive grasp is an insight\r\ninto reality that bears the certainty of immediate experience. No\r\ndiscursive process intervenes; one simply knows the phenomenon as it is\r\nexperienced. Furthermore, the intuitive grasp provides a kind of\r\ndefinite and whole understanding, a gestalt, that allows recognition of\r\nthe phenomenon in other situations. So when the person is faced with\r\nanother event he can say, \"Yes, that is the phenomenon under\r\nconsideration,\" or \"No, that is not it.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to be open to the data of experience in using a\r\nphenomenological approach, one strives to eliminate \"the _a priori_\"\r\n(that which exists in his mind prior to and independent of the\r\nexperience). This is done by attempting to \"bracket\" (hold in abeyance)\r\ntheoretical presuppositions, interpretations, labels, categories,\r\njudgments, and so forth. Granted, a person cannot be completely\r\nperspectiveless. Man is an individual; he is a unique here and now\r\nperson. So naturally, _necessarily_, he has an \"angular\" view for he\r\nexperiences reality from the angle of his own particular \"here\" and his\r\nown particular \"now.\" Or, stated differently, as a knowing, experiencing\r\nsubject, each man must have _some_ perspective of the phenomenon being\r\nexperienced. However, by recognizing and considering the particular\r\nperspective from which he is experiencing it, a person may become more\r\nopen to the thing itself.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this kind of openness to one's own perspective can be\r\ndeveloped through deliberate practice. Several approaches may be used.\r\nTo begin with, a person can develop the habit of recognizing and\r\nexposing his own biases. This could involve something as basic as\r\nstating the actual physical situation or circumstance in which the\r\nphenomenon was experienced. For example: the phenomenon could be\r\nsomething seen from above or below, at a distance or nearby; something\r\nheard in a quiet room or above the din of background noise; a patient's\r\nbehavior in a large group or in a small group, with his family, with on\r\nparticular nurse, with his doctor; a patient's response while being fed,\r\nbathed, monitored.\r\n\r\nBeyond this unavoidable bias of the angle of perception, the nurse's\r\nexperience of her lived world may be dulled by habituation. It is\r\nnecessary to break through the tunnel vision of routine. For instance, a\r\nnurse new to a situation may notice a patient's response to her and\r\nremark about it to another nurse. The second nurse, to whom the\r\npatient's behavior is familiar, may respond, \"Oh, he's done that for\r\nyears.\" Often this is the end of the dialogue; it should be the\r\nbeginning, for the duration of a phenomenon is not {81} equal to its\r\ndescription or meaning, but rather, is an indication of its\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\nThe mystery of the commonplace is hidden by veils of the obvious. To\r\nrecognize one's biases means to put one's beliefs, one's cherished\r\nnotions, out on the table. A helpful aid in reflecting on and\r\narticulating an experience is the question, \"What am I taking for\r\ngranted?\" Commonly used terms, such as, \"psychiatric patient,\"\r\n\"orthopedic patient,\" \"oncology unit,\" \"uncooperative,\" \"emotional,\"\r\n\"chronic,\" \"terminal,\" \"hopeless,\" \"outpatient,\" \"ambulatory,\"\r\n\"visitors,\" \"family,\" \"doctor,\" \"nurse,\" \"administration,\" \"front\r\noffice\" have an aura of connotations that may correspond to or differ\r\ngreatly from the actual immediate experience. It may be a case where\r\nbelieving is seeing. The habit of premature labeling may close a person\r\nto the full savoring of experience.\r\n\r\nAnother means of increasing openness to one's own perspective is to\r\nconsciously note whether the phenomenon is being experienced actively or\r\npassively. For example, the phenomenon may be the motion of changing a\r\npatient's position in bed. Both experience the motion, but it is a\r\ndifferent experience for the nurse who actively moves the patient and\r\nfor the patient who is moved passively. Or again, many studies of the\r\nphenomenon of empathy have been reported in the literature. Almost\r\nexclusively, these are descriptions of empathizing with someone; only\r\nrarely are they concerned with the experience of being empathized with.\r\nYet obviously, the active and passive experiences of the phenomenon of\r\nempathy are different. The same holds true for touching and being\r\ntouched, bathing and being bathed, feeding and being fed, supporting and\r\nbeing supported, reassuring and being reassured, and many other\r\nphenomena in nursing.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, awareness of one's perspective may be increased by\r\nconsciously realizing whether the phenomenon is being viewed objectively\r\nor subjectively. Consider for example, phenomena such as pain, anxiety,\r\nsleep, restlessness, boredom. Seeing evidence of pain in another person\r\nis not the same as feeling pain within myself. Recognizing objective\r\nsigns of anxiety in another person differs from the subjective\r\nexperience of feeling anxious myself. Sleeping and observing someone\r\nsleeping are two different experiences. The same hold true for\r\nrestlessness, boredom, and so forth.\r\n\r\nIn view of nursing's dialogical character it may be assumed that many\r\nphenomena of major concern would be intersubjective or transactional. It\r\nis important then for nurses, attempting to develop openness to their\r\nown perspectives, to consider whether the phenomenon involves two\r\nsubjects and their between. Does the action go both ways? Are both\r\npersons calling and responding to each other simultaneously? Take the\r\nphenomenon of \"timing\" for example. The nurse's verbal response to a\r\npatient depends not only on her perception of her own here-and-now and\r\nhis perception of his here-and-now but rather it also involves their\r\nperceptions of their shared here-and-now situation. The nursing world is\r\nfilled with intersubjective phenomena such as, eye {82} contact, touch,\r\nsilence. To describe these fully the nurse must be open to her\r\nperspective, the patient's perspective, and their between.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalysis, Synthesis, and Description\r\n\r\nAfter a nursing phenomenon is grasped intuitively, it is desirable to\r\nfind as many instances of it as possible for the sake of description.\r\nKeeping the phenomenon in mind and reflecting on it from time to time,\r\nthe nurse becomes more alert to its occurrence in her lived world. The\r\nphenomenon may be experienced directly. In which case, it is described\r\nand reflected on and descriptions, reflections, and questions are\r\nrecorded. When she observes the phenomenon in others, the nurse may ask\r\nthem to describe it and verify her own observations. Some nurses have\r\ninvolved other staff members in discovering and describing instances of\r\nthe phenomenon being studied. Similarly, one becomes more open to\r\ndescriptions of it in the literature--any literature--or in any form of\r\nhuman expression, for example, poetry, drama, art, science. As many\r\ndescriptions of the phenomenon are gathered from as many angles as\r\npossible, these are the data to be analytically examined, synthesized,\r\nand described.\r\n\r\nThe three processes of analysis, synthesis, and description are so\r\ninterrelated and so intertwined in reality that it is simpler to discuss\r\ntechniques in relation to all three. Some techniques are equally useful\r\nin the analytic examination and the description of phenomena. In a\r\nsense, a person does both at once. And often, it is during this process\r\nof shifting back and forth, analyzing and describing an experience that\r\nsynthesis occurs. A person gets a sudden insight, \"everything falls into\r\nplace,\" \"it clicks.\" One gets a gestalt, a whole, not necessarily a\r\nwhole in the sense of complete and entire, but a whole frame, form, or\r\nstructure that allows for further developing and filling in of details.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways of going about the analysis and description. The\r\nfollowing are some that have been found useful in the explication of\r\nnursing phenomena.\r\n\r\nComparing and contrasting instances of the phenomenon lead to the\r\ndiscovery of similarities and differences. For instance, in studying\r\npatients' crying it was found that their crying was with or without\r\ntears; loud or silent; expressing pain, anger, fear, sorrow. Or again,\r\nsilence may be defined simply as absence of sound. But silence as\r\nexperienced in the real nursing world has other characteristics. It may\r\nconvey anger, fear, peacefulness, and so forth. It is these nuances or\r\nqualities of silence that are significant cues for the nursing dialogue.\r\nThey could be brought to light by comparing and contrasting descriptions\r\nof silence.\r\n\r\nVarious instances of the phenomenon being studied may be examined to\r\ndiscover common elements. Characteristics or elements seen in one\r\ninstance are sought in the others. For example, when descriptions of\r\ninterpersonal empathy were scrutinized, it became evident that in all\r\ncases there were physiological, psychological, and social components.\r\nExamining experiences {83} of reassurance revealed they had elements\r\nsuch as empathy, sympathy, reality orientation, feelings of hope and\r\ncomfort.\r\n\r\nOne may determine which elements are essential to the phenomenon by\r\nimaginative variation, that is, by trying to imagine the phenomenon\r\nwithout a particular element. For instance, reassurance without empathy\r\nor sympathy would be false reassurance or, in other words, would not\r\nreassure.\r\n\r\nThe elements of the phenomenon can be studied to determine how they are\r\ninterrelated. One may ask, is there a priority in time? Does one element\r\ndevelop from another? Consider the phenomenon of reassurance; does\r\nempathy precede sympathy? Or, to take another example, in the empathic\r\nexperience, an openness to the other and an imaginative projection into\r\nhis place lead to the vicarious experiencing of his situation.\r\n\r\nFor further clarification of its distinctive qualities the phenomenon\r\nmay be related to and distinguished from other similar phenomena. For\r\nexample, empathy is similar to and also different from identification,\r\nprojection, compassion, sympathy, love, and encounter.\r\n\r\nBy considering what it has in common with other phenomena, the\r\nphenomenon being described may be classified as being subsumed in a\r\nbroader category. Thus, empathy is a human response, a coalescent\r\nmovement, a form of relating.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon may be described by selecting its central or decisive\r\ncharacteristics and abstracting its accidentals. For instance,\r\ninterpersonal empathy always involves movement into another's\r\nperspective and as a form of movement it has directions, dimensions, and\r\ndegrees. It can occur between persons of difference age, education,\r\nexperience, sex; these latter characteristics are accidental.\r\n\r\nSome descriptions make use of negation. A phenomenon cannot be described\r\ncompletely by negation but it may be clarified to some extent by saying\r\nwhat it is not. For instance, empathy is not sympathy; it is not\r\nprojection; it is not identification.\r\n\r\nAnalogy may be used to promote analytic examination and description.\r\nThis involves a comparison based on partial similarity between like\r\nfeatures of two things. For example, the movement of empathy is like the\r\ncurrents in the sea; the heart is like a pump. The advantage of using\r\nanalogy is that the comparison raises questions about the nature of the\r\nphenomenon under consideration. However, since the similarity between\r\nthe analogues is always partial, one must guard against overextending\r\nthe comparison to unwarranted conclusions. The description must always\r\nbe consonant with the phenomenon as it occurs in reality.\r\n\r\nThe use of a metaphor also may enhance description and analysis. A\r\nmetaphor suggests comparison of the phenomenon with another by the\r\nnonliteral application of a word. For example, \"the between is a secret\r\nplace.\" The use of metaphor may be criticized in regard to its lack of\r\nprecision. On the other hand, there are some (for example, Marcel,\r\nBuber) who hold that the intersubjective realm can be described only\r\nmetaphorically because it is {84} beyond the level of objectivity. And\r\nto attempt to describe intersubjective phenomena in precise terms\r\nrelated to the physical world would tend to distort rather than clarify.\r\nMany of the nursing phenomena requiring description occur within the\r\nintersubjective realm. Metaphors could cast some light on these.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAs a theory of practice, humanistic nursing is derived from individual\r\nnurses' actual experiences in their uniquely perceived but commonly\r\nshared nursing world. Its development, therefore, depends on the\r\narticulation of their angular views and also on the truly collaborative\r\neffort of a genuine community of nurses struggling together to describe\r\nhumanistic nursing practice.\r\n\r\nSince the description of nursing phenomena is recognized as a basic and\r\nessential step in theory development, this chapter presented an approach\r\nand detailed some techniques used by nurses to describe phenomena. It is\r\nhoped that these would be viewed critically and creatively; that they\r\nwould be used, varied, combined adapted, and lead to new methods suited\r\nto the description of nursing phenomena. And if they are developed, it\r\nis hoped that they will be shared for the growth of humanistic nursing\r\ndepends not only on using and sharing what we learn but also on\r\ndescribing how we come to know. Then humanistic nursing theory will grow\r\nin dialogue.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Loretta T. Zderad, \"A Concept of Empathy\" (Ph.D. dissertation,\r\nGeorgetown University, 1968). Josephine G.

Logically, humane caring must be one aspect (a major aspect)\r\nor a natural expression of humanistic nursing practice theory. But the\r\nterm means more. According to the position being taken here, nursing may\r\nbe described appropriately as humanistic since at its very base it is an\r\ninter-human event. As an intersubjective transaction, its meaning is\r\nfound in the human situation in which it occurs. As an existential act,\r\nit involves all the participants' capacities and aims at the development\r\nof human potential, that is, at well-being and more-being. Our approach\r\nqualifies, then, as a form of humanism, according to the dictionary\r\ndefinition, being \"a system or mode of thought or action in which human\r\ninterests, values, and dignity are taken to be of primary importance.\"\r\n\r\nIn another sense of the word, our theoretical stance is humanistic by\r\nvirtue of its regard for the humanities and arts. Philosophy,\r\nliterature, poetry, drama, and other forms of art are valued as\r\nresources for enriching our knowledge of man and the human situation.\r\nThey also are seen as suitable means for expressing or describing the\r\nlived realities of the nurse's world.\r\n\r\nContemporary nursing, being a true child of its time, reflects American\r\nsociety's high regard for \"Science.\" Values of science are easily\r\ndiscernible in nursing and affect the character of its research,\r\neducation, and practice. Consider, for instance, how the nursing\r\ndialogue is influenced by the prizing of objectivity, precision of\r\nlanguage, operational definitions, scientific jargon, development of\r\nconstructs and theories, methodology of scientific inquiry, emphasis on\r\nquantification and measurement.\r\n\r\nThere is much more written in our current literature about nursing as a\r\nscience than about nursing as an art. Although slighted, the humanities\r\nhave not been rejected. In fact, some nurses and educators are urging\r\nthat the role {86} of the humanities and arts be recognized in nursing\r\nand that they be used more effectively in undergraduate and graduate\r\nnursing education.[1]\r\n\r\nTurning to my own personal experience, I recall that one of the first\r\ndefinitions I had to learn in my basic nursing program began with the\r\nstatement, \"Nursing is an art and science....\" (It is interesting that\r\nnow, years later, this is all I can recall of the definition!) At that\r\ntime, I accepted the statement at face value. I did not question it.\r\nPerhaps I had not thought enough about art and science and certainly I\r\ndid not know enough about nursing to question the description. Yet over\r\nthe years many experiences and insights have turned into questions that\r\nchallenge this adopted cherished notion.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning I merely accepted the view that nursing is an art in\r\nthe sense of being a skillful or aesthetic application of scientific\r\nprinciples. After all, we had a course in nursing arts (later called\r\nfundamentals of nursing). This had to do with bathing, feeding, making\r\nbeds, and hundreds of other nursing procedures that were presented as\r\n\"nursing arts,\" the doing of nursing. At the time I also had courses in\r\nthe humanities and liberal arts. These courses were not related directly\r\nto nursing by either the teachers or myself, as I recall. I did not ask:\r\nIn what way is nursing an art? What kind of art is nursing? Or, how does\r\nthe art of nursing differ from other arts?\r\n\r\nThe notion (perhaps \"conviction\" would be more accurate) that nursing is\r\nan art in some sense other than an artful application of scientific\r\nprinciples has been with me for a long time. I do not know its origin\r\nnor even the form in which the view first appealed to me. I do recall\r\nhaving difficulty on several occasions in trying to express let alone\r\nexplain, my idea. At these times, what I experienced subjectively as an\r\nintuitive flash of insight would end up objectified in an amorphous blob\r\nof words. Yet the theme returns over and over in a variety of questions\r\nand issues that demand response if not resolution. This chapter offers\r\nsome further reflections on the relatedness of humanistic nursing and\r\nart.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSE OF ARTS\r\n\r\nOne of the most obvious ways in which nursing and art are related is in\r\nnursing's use of the arts. This may be seen in nursing education as well\r\nas in nursing practice.\r\n\r\n{87}\r\n\r\n\r\nLiberalization\r\n\r\nUsually, when arts and humanities are included in nursing education\r\nprograms, it is for their humanizing effects. Traditionally they have\r\nbeen recognized as having a civilizing influence. So in nursing they are\r\nseen as supporting the elements of humaneness and humanitarianism.\r\nFurthermore, they are a necessary antidote for the depersonalization\r\nthat accompanies scientific technology and mechanization.\r\n\r\nThe arts are valued also for their liberalizing effect. They stimulate\r\nimaginative creativity. They broaden a person's perspective of the human\r\nsituation, of man in his world. For instance, depictions of suffering\r\nman or of other aspects of the human condition that are found in poetry,\r\ndrama, or literature are far more descriptive and much closer to reality\r\nthan those given in typical textbooks.\r\n\r\nCurrent nursing practice reflects the educational preparation of nurses\r\nthat is weighted heavily with scientific courses and the methodology of\r\npositivistic science. Arts and humanities are a necessary complement.\r\nScience aims at universals and the discovery of general laws; art\r\nreveals the uniqueness of the individual. While science strives for\r\nquantification, art is more concerned with quality. Strict conformance\r\nto methodology and replicability are prized in scientific studies,\r\nwhereas freedom and uniqueness of style reign in art. Science, forever\r\nupdating itself, opens the nurse's eyes to constant change and\r\ninnovation; the classics promote a sense of the unchanging and lasting\r\nin man's world. Science may provide the nurse with knowledge on which to\r\nbase her decision, but it remains for the arts and humanities to direct\r\nthe nurse toward examination of values underlying her practice. Thus,\r\nhumanistic nursing has both scientific and artistic dimensions.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpression\r\n\r\nHumanistic nursing and art are interrelated in another way. Some nurses\r\nwho are also artists use their respective arts to express their nursing\r\nexperience. Poetry is a good example.\r\n\r\nIn an article, \"Nurses as Poets,\" Trautman notes that since the 1940s\r\nprogressively greater numbers of poems about nursing have been published\r\nand since the 1960s the quality of these poems has improved\r\nconsiderably.[2] She believes that nurses' ability to express their\r\nfeelings about nursing in poetry cannot be attributed entirely to a\r\nchange in times. Rather, it is a reflection of change in nursing\r\npractice. For one thing, contemporary nursing requires a great deal of\r\nabstract thinking. It calls for an understanding involving mental and\r\nemotional investment, and imaginative feeling _with_ the patient. The\r\n{88} nurse-poet puts aside technical terms, looks at her patient in a\r\nfresh and creative way and shares her view in a poem.\r\n\r\nA second reason offered by Trautman is the increased emphasis in nursing\r\neducation on communication and verbal skills. A nurse with a talent for\r\nwriting may be moved by a particular experience to share it. Thus, \"the\r\nsensitive nurse-writer may use poetic expression to work through a\r\nproblem, to muse about a detail, or to record a profound experience.\"[3]\r\n\r\nFinally, she states that some nurses write poetry about aspects of their\r\nwork that defy scientific analysis and cannot be easily contained in\r\ntechnical papers. In this, then, nurses' poetry goes beyond the personal\r\nsatisfaction accompanying expression; it preserves a unique angular view\r\nof nursing's lived world and adds to our store of clinical wisdom. As\r\nTrautman concludes:\r\n\r\n     \"Poetry has trailed the profession for many years, probably\r\n     because nurses were not encouraged in creative writing of any\r\n     kind. Today, however, I think that poetry leads the profession\r\n     because most of it never loses sight of human needs--both\r\n     nurses' and patients'. Our poets lend a clear and vital voice\r\n     to our profession. They cite their experiences, emotions,\r\n     beliefs, and awareness in lieu of a science-oriented\r\n     bibliography. They appeal to our common sense but, more\r\n     importantly to our hearts. They tell us to observe honestly and\r\n     to feel. Above all, our poets tell us to believe in our\r\n     observations and to trust in our feelings--for patients, for\r\n     ourselves.\"[4]\r\n\r\nSome elements or aspects of nursing lend themselves to scientific\r\nexploration and discovery while others, equally important and likewise\r\ndeserving expression, reveal themselves only through the artist's\r\nvision. So what has been said of poetry, therefore, may hold true in\r\nother arts. Each art has its own form of dialogue with reality. The\r\npainter, for example, feels with his eyes; he feels lines, points,\r\nplanes, texture, and color.[5] What could the nurse-painter share? Or as\r\nGarner, a nurse-musician, suggests, nursing could be conceptualized\r\nalong the schema of tones, texture, rhythm, meter, intensity,\r\ntemperament.[6]\r\n\r\nWhat nursing content would accrue if the various nurse-artists used\r\ntheir forms of knowledge, skill, and vision to explore nursing as the\r\nvarious nurse-scientists do? What can our poets, painters, musicians and\r\ndancers see, hear, feel in the nursing dialogue?\r\n\r\n\r\nTherapeutics\r\n\r\nThere is a third way in which humanistic nursing and art are related.\r\nFor many years, the arts have been used in nursing for their therapeutic\r\neffects, especially with psychiatric, geriatric, and pediatric patients.\r\nThe nurse and a patient or a group of patients participate in an\r\nartistic experience together. These may be passive activities, such as,\r\nattending a concert or play or visiting {89} an art exhibit; or they\r\nmay be active ones in which nurse and patients are involved in artistic\r\nexpression or creation.\r\n\r\nMusic, poetry, painting, drama, and dance have been used effectively in\r\nvarious nursing situations. For instance, Christoffers, a nurse and\r\ndancer, emphasizes the importance of body language as communication and\r\nsupports her view with clinical evidence. She urges nurses to become\r\n\"physically literate--to develop an understanding and appreciation of\r\nthe part played by body language in human relationships.\"[7] Or again,\r\naccording to Garner, \"Music, when carefully planned, can be used as a\r\nsource of culture, nurturance, communication, socialization, and\r\ntherapeusis.\"[8]\r\n\r\nA major therapeutic value of art lies in the fact that it confronts one\r\nwith reality. \"Art is a lie which makes us realize the truth.\"[9] In his\r\nnovel, _The Conspiracy_, Hersey has Lucan, a poet, write to Seneca:\r\n\r\n     \"To me the ideal of a work of art is that each man should be\r\n     able, in contemplating it, to see himself as he really is. Thus\r\n     art and reality meet. This is the great healing strength of\r\n     art, this is the power of art, ... Art's power which nothing\r\n     can challenge, is the blinding light of recognition.\"[10]\r\n\r\nBy using various art forms the nurse helps the patient experience,\r\nbecome aware of, and express his feelings. When the activity occurs in a\r\ngroup, the members have the additional advantage of sharing in others'\r\nexpressions and of developing fellow-feeling. Increased socialization is\r\nanother important therapeutic effect nurse-artists/art appreciators seek\r\nin the use of art. A corollary benefit is improved communication between\r\nthe patient and the nurse or between the patient and others.\r\n\r\nObviously, self-knowledge and fellow-feeling are consistent with the aim\r\nof humanistic nursing to nurture well-being and more-being. A person\r\ndevelops his human potential and becomes the unique individual he is\r\nthrough his relationships with other men.\r\n\r\n\r\nNURSING AS ART\r\n\r\nThus far, this chapter has been concerned with the relatedness of\r\nnursing and art. It was seen that nurses may study arts and humanities\r\nfor a broader understanding of the human situation, may express their\r\nnursing worlds through various art forms, and may use the arts\r\ntherapeutically. Now the question is raised whether nursing is an art,\r\nand if so, what kind of art.\r\n\r\n{90}\r\n\r\n\r\nArtful Application\r\n\r\nEven the most scientific nurses do not deny that nursing is, in some\r\nway, an art. But precisely how the art and science of nursing are\r\ninterrelated is not clear. For example, Abdellah writes:\r\n\r\n     \"The art of nursing must not be confused with the science of\r\n     nursing. The former concerns itself with intuitive and\r\n     technical skills (often ritualistic), and also the more\r\n     supportive aspects of nursing; the latter concerns itself with\r\n     scientific truths. Both are important. They are interwoven and\r\n     complement each other.\"[11]\r\n\r\nHowever, Abdellah gives no further elaboration of this point. Usually,\r\nwhen nurses are asked about the relatedness of the art and the science\r\nof nursing, the view expressed is that science has to do with general\r\nprinciples and laws that govern nursing and art has to do with the\r\nparticular application of principles in individual cases. Furthermore,\r\nwhen a nurse describes some event as \"beautiful nursing\" and is pressed\r\nto elaborate, she usually describes nursing actions that were performed\r\n\"artfully,\" \"skillfully,\" \"harmoniously.\" Thus, in some way, the art of\r\nnursing has to do with the nurse's response to human needs through\r\nactions that are purposeful and aesthetic.\r\n\r\n\r\nUseful Art\r\n\r\nIn current usage, the term \"art\" is most commonly associated with the\r\nbeautiful, that is, with aesthetics or the fine arts. Frequently, it is\r\nrestricted even more to signify one group of the fine arts, namely,\r\npainting and sculpture. For instance, one refers simply to an \"art\r\nexhibit\" or an \"art\" museum but specifies further \"a center for the\r\nperforming arts.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, historically the word \"art\" was related to utility and\r\nknowledge, and its traditional meanings still exist today. For example,\r\nwe speak of \"industrial arts\" and \"arts and crafts\" through which useful\r\nthings are produced. On the other hand, \"liberal arts\" (work befitting a\r\nfree man) are those related to skills of the mind. We also refer to the\r\nart of medicine, of teaching, of nursing, of politics, of navigation, of\r\nmilitary strategy, and so forth.\r\n\r\nThe word \"art\" can refer to both the effect of human work (works of art)\r\nand the cause of things produced by human work (the knowledge and skill\r\nof the artist). It is obvious that not only knowledge but also some form\r\nof work and skill are involved in all art, useful or fine. \"Art\" is the\r\nroot of \"artisan\" as well as of \"artist.\"[12]\r\n\r\nSome arts, such as nursing, medicine, and teaching, may be considered\r\nuseful, yet they differ from other useful arts, such as industrial arts,\r\nfor they {91} do not result in tangible products. Nursing for instance,\r\naims purposively for well-being, more-being, health, comfort, growth.\r\nThese are the results of the art of nursing. As an artist, therefore,\r\nthe nurse must know how to obtain desired effects and must work\r\nskillfully to get them. The nurse cannot make well-being or comfort or\r\nhealth as one can make a shoe or a painting or a speech. The art of\r\nnursing involves a skillful doing rather than a making. Furthermore,\r\nnursing is concerned with changes in human persons not merely with the\r\ntransformation of physical objects. It is intersubjective and\r\ntransactional, so the art of nursing must involve a doing with and a\r\nbeing with.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerforming Art\r\n\r\nAlong this vein, nursing may be viewed as a kind of performing art.\r\nFahy, nurse-educator-actress, draws an interesting comparison between\r\nthe process of nursing and acting in a drama.\r\n\r\n     \"In a play the actors know certain things, there are a certain\r\n     number of given circumstances: plot, events, epoch, time, and\r\n     plan of action, conditions of life, director's interpretation.\r\n     The technical things are also there: setting, props, lights,\r\n     sound effects, and so forth. But it remains at the time of\r\n     curtain for the actors to go on alone and produce. In the act\r\n     of nursing there are some known facts that the nursing student\r\n     or the nurse can pick up: name, age, religion, ethnic\r\n     background, medical diagnosis, and plan of care (sometimes),\r\n     her own background knowledge and experience, and her own unique\r\n     personality. However, when she encounters other patients--watch\r\n     it! The same thing happens in the teaching-learning process.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Edward A. Wright in _Understanding Today's Theater_ says about\r\n     the actor and acting something which I believe about the nurse\r\n     and nursing.\r\n\r\n     '... the actor ... is his own instrument. His tools are\r\n     himself, his talent, and his ability. Unlike other creative\r\n     artists, he must work through and with his own body, voice,\r\n     emotions, appearance, and his own elusive personal quality....\r\n     He uses his intelligence, his memory of emotions, his\r\n     experiences, and his knowledge of himself and his fellow\r\n     men--but always he is his own instrument.'\"[13]\r\n\r\nHere is another example of viewing nursing as a performing art. Once a\r\nnurse was trying to describe the nursing care she received from another\r\nnurse when she had been ill. She struggled with some details of finer\r\npoints and then summed it up by saying, \"I felt her nursing care was\r\njust like a symphony. That's the only way I can describe it.\"\r\n\r\nThese comparisons bring many aesthetic qualities to mind, for instance,\r\nharmony, rhythm, tone, feeling. Nursing is like music and drama in other\r\nways. The nursing procedure, like a musical score or a play script,\r\nallows for individual interpretations, adaptations, and embellishments.\r\nAlthough nurses follow the same general principles, each can develop her\r\nown unique style. {92} If nursing really is viewed as a performing art,\r\nthere are opportunities for creative exploration and development of the\r\nart of nursing. And furthermore, these individualized styles of nursing\r\nare worthy of description and sharing.\r\n\r\nAnother similarity is the ephemeral character of nursing, music, and\r\ndrama. A particular nursing transaction, like a concert or play, is\r\ntransitory, short-lived. Yet the effects may be long-lasting and\r\nremembered. There is this difference in nursing, I believe. Each nursing\r\ntransaction may flow into a stream of nursing care extending\r\ncontinuously over 24 hours a day for weeks, months, years. And many\r\nindividual nurses \"get into the act.\" How does this affect the art of\r\nnursing? How is nursing like and unlike the other performing arts? The\r\nanswers to these and similar questions must come from the nurse-artists.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUMANISTIC NURSING AS CLINICAL ART\r\n\r\nThe relatedness of nursing and art, viewed existentially, is more basic,\r\nmore fundamental than mere similarity of qualities and characteristics\r\nas discussed above. Both art and nursing are kinds of lived dialogue. In\r\nboth, man responds to his world of men and things through distance and\r\nrelation. They affect him and he affects them with the creative force of\r\nhis relation.\r\n\r\nIn fact, one may say further that humanistic nursing is _itself_ an\r\nart--a clinical art--creative and existential. This is evident when one\r\nreturns again to the thing itself, to the nursing dialogue as it is\r\nlived in the everyday world.\r\n\r\nIn genuine meeting the nurse recognizes the patient as distinct from\r\nherself and turns to him as a presence. She is fully present to him,\r\nauthentically with her whole being and is open to him, not as an object,\r\nbut as a presence, a human being with potentials. In such a genuine\r\nlived dialogue, the nurse sees within the patient a form (that is, a\r\npossibility) of well-being or more-being (or comfort or health or\r\ngrowth, and so forth). Like a beautiful landscape inspiring a painter or\r\npoet, the form in the patient addresses itself to the nurse, a call for\r\nhelp demanding recognition and response. The form is clearer than\r\nexperienced objects; it is not an image of her fancy; it exists in the\r\npresent although it is not \"objective.\" The relation in which the nurse\r\n(artist) stands to the form is real for it affects her and she affects\r\nit. If she enters into genuine relation with the patient (I-Thou) her\r\neffective power (caring, nursing skills, hope) brings forth the form\r\n(well-being, more-being, comfort, growth), just as the painter's or\r\npoet's power and skill create a painting or a poem.\r\n\r\nOf course, there is this difference. The art of nursing, being\r\ngoal-directed and intersubjective, is more complex than the arts of\r\npainting and poetry, for example. As a clinical art, it involves _being\r\nwith_ and _doing with_. For the patient must participate as an active\r\nsubject to actualize the possibility (form) within himself. Perhaps the\r\nart of nursing could be described as transactional. Not only does the\r\nnurse see the possibilities in the patient but the patient also sees a\r\nform in the nurse (for example, possibility of help, of comfort, of\r\nsupport), and he responds in relation to bring it forth. {93}\r\n\r\nThen the question logically may be raised: Is the patient's responses in\r\nrelation (I-Thou) a necessary condition for the art of nursing? Or to\r\nstate it differently: can there be any art of nursing the infant, the\r\nunresponsive, the comatose, the dying? I would answer that the art of\r\nnursing can exist even if the relation is not mutual. For as Buber\r\nwrites,\r\n\r\n     \"Even if the man to whom I say _Thou_ is not aware of it in the\r\n     midst of his experience, yet relation may exist. For _Thou_ is\r\n     more than _It_ realises. No deception penetrates here; here is\r\n     the cradle of Real Life.\"[14]\r\n\r\n\r\nDIALOGICAL NURSING: ART-SCIENCE\r\n\r\nArt and science, like nursing, represent angular views. Each is a view\r\nwith a particular purpose. They are human responses to the everyday\r\nworld in which man lives. Existentially speaking, each is a form of\r\nliving dialogue between man and his human situation.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that there is in nursing a kind of human response to\r\nreality that is a combination, a true synthesis of art and science? The\r\nmore one focuses on nursing as it is lived, on the intersubjective\r\ntransaction as it is experienced in the everyday world, the more\r\nquestions arise about it as art and science. Elements of both art and\r\nscience are evident in nursing. The practicing nurse must integrate them\r\nin her mode of being in the situation.\r\n\r\nWhile Dr. Josephine Paterson was developing a methodology of inquiry\r\nfrom a clinical nursing process and describing her construct of the\r\n\"all-at-once,\" she was so intent on communicating the interrelated\r\nreality of the art and science elements in nursing, that she welded them\r\ntogether with a hyphen into one word, \"art-science.\" And even then there\r\nis some dissatisfaction when the weld is interpreted merely as a seam.\r\nFor the combination is more than additive; it is a new synthetic whole.\r\n\r\nI experienced a similar difficulty in trying to describe the synthesis\r\nof art and science that takes place in the nursing process. The nursing\r\ndialogue reflects the orientations of art and science for it involves\r\nboth the patient's and the nurse's subjective and objective worlds. I\r\nbelieve the synthesis of art and science is _lived_ by the nurse in the\r\nnursing act. This is a phenomenon more readily experienced than\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nYet if we truly experience nursing as a kind of art-science, as a\r\nparticular kind of flowing, synthesizing, subjective-objective\r\nintersubjective dialogue, then nursing offers a unique path to human\r\nknowledge and it is our responsibility to try to describe and share it.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] New England Council on Higher Education for Nursing, _Humanities and\r\nthe Arts as Bases for Nursing:_ Implications for Newer Dimensions in\r\nGeneric Nursing Education, Proceedings of the Fifth Inter-University\r\nWork Conference (Lennox, Mass: New England Council on Higher Education\r\nfor Nursing, June, 1968). \"Humanities, Humaneness, Humanitarianism,\"\r\nEditorial in _Nursing Outlook_, Vol. 18, No. 9 (September, 1970), p. 21.\r\nCharles E.

The outcome represents my present\r\nconscious conceptualization of my personal theory of nursing. It has\r\ngrown out of my nursing practice experience, my reflecting, relating,\r\ndescribing, and synthesizing. This is heuristic culmination of much\r\nmulling over my lived world of nursing.\r\n\r\n\r\nANGULAR VIEW: PRESENT PERSPECTIVE\r\n\r\nIn 1971 after a presentation on concept development I heard myself in a\r\nchatty response to the audience declare my unique theory of nursing. It\r\nwas based in constructs that I had developed and conceptualized.\r\nPreviously I had viewed these constructs only as distinct entities. My\r\nsynthesis of them surprised me. This was the first time I conveyed them\r\nas my why, how, and what of nursing. This synthesis may have emerged as\r\na sequence to my reexamination and reflection on each of these\r\nconstructs in preparation for this 1971 presentation.[1] Now it became\r\nevident that their sequential evolvement had a logic that had come from\r\nmy being without my awareness.\r\n\r\nSince 1971 I have planned to reflect on these synthetic constructs to\r\nbetter understand how they relate to one another complementarily. Why?\r\nTo further the development of these constructs and to state them as\r\npropositions. Statements of propositions are movement toward nursing\r\ntheory. Theory is considered here as a conceptualized vision teased out\r\nof my knowing from my nursing experience.\r\n\r\n{96}\r\n\r\nLike Elie Wiesel, the novelist and literary artist, I write to better\r\nunderstand and to attest to happenings. This chapter is the fruit of\r\nthis endeavor.\r\n\r\nThe first term, \"comfort,\" was developed as a construct in 1967. After\r\nrecording and exploring my clinical experiential data, a conceptualized\r\nresponse emerged to my question: \"Why, as a nurse, am I in the clinical\r\nhealth-nursing situation?\" The second term, \"clinical,\" was developed as\r\na construct in 1968. It was a conceptualized response to a dialectical\r\nprocess within myself. I asked, \"What is clinical?\" I answered, \"I am a\r\nclinician.\" I asked, \"As a nurse clinician what do I do; what is the\r\ncondition of my being in the nursing situation?\" I answered, \"This\r\ndescribed would equate to clinical.\" Consequently I compared and\r\ncontrasted two nursing experiences similarly labeled to properly grasp\r\nthe principle of \"clinical\" for conceptualization. The third term or\r\nphrase, \"all-at-once,\" arose intuitively within me as a construct in\r\n1969 and was partially conceptualized. It arose after mulling over other\r\nnurses' published clinical data and asking, \"What can you tell me of the\r\nclinical nursing situation?\" \"What do you perceive as the nature of\r\nnursing?\" Therese G. Muller's, Ruth Gilbert's and my thought on the\r\nnursing situation merged into a view of these as multifariously loaded\r\nwith all levels of incomparable data, the \"all-at-once.\"\r\nIncommensurables relate to the nature of nursing and its concerns. How\r\ncan one study unrelated appearances? Muller often used an historical\r\napproach while Gilbert emphasized individualization. In humanistic\r\nnursing practice theory a descriptive, intersubjective, phenomenological\r\napproach is proposed for greater understanding and attestation of the\r\nevents and process of the nursing situation. The construction of\r\n\"comfort, clinical, and all-at-once\" I would now label as conceptualized\r\nphenomenologically. I view them as relevant phenomena to any nurse and\r\nthis nurse-in-her-nursing-world.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheory: Unrest, Beginning Involvement\r\n\r\nThis desire to develop nursing theory goes back to my years (1959-64) as\r\na faculty member in a graduate nursing program. I fussed with the idea,\r\ndid not know exactly what I was fussing about, and expressed my desire,\r\ninterest, and concern poorly. Much, I am sure now, to others' dismay.\r\nTeaching in nursing was an offering of multitudinous theories developed\r\nin and for other disciplines using nursing examples. There were both\r\nsimilarities and differences in the many nursing examples in which\r\nattempts were made to describe the qualities of the participants'\r\nbeings. Emphasis was placed on the observations by the nurse of the\r\nothers' responses in the nursing situation. Nursing education was rife\r\nwith lengthy repetitive examples utilized to focus on particular\r\nvariations. I desired a unifying base applicable to all nursing\r\nsituations. This was not a seeking for conformity nor an attempt to\r\nnegate individuality. Certainly I did not want such a base to exclude\r\nindividual nurses' talents. Rather this base, foundation of nursing\r\nindicative of the nature of nursing, would heuristically promote endless\r\nvariations to flow, blossom, cross-pollinate, and evolve. {97}\r\n\r\nIn these observations and thinkings I was attempting to understand, sort\r\nout, and clarify the questions that underlay my puzzlement. This\r\npuzzlement arose out of my 18 years in nursing practice and education.\r\nIn a theory course and a philosophy of science course, while in doctoral\r\nstudy, I recognized and learned to label my unrest and puzzlement as a\r\nrecognition of the need for nursing theory.\r\n\r\nIn 1966 in discussing my purposes for doctoral study, I expressed this\r\nunrest and puzzlement. I viewed my varied past experiences in nursing as\r\nexcellent. I sought time to reflect on the past 24 years of living\r\nnursing to see what it could tell me, and to come to better understand\r\nits meaning to the profession of nursing. The philosophical nature of\r\nthese questions and what they express of myself is evident. Such\r\npersonal revelation at this time is no risk, and withholding would only\r\ndeprive myself and others of the answers that might be brought forth.\r\n\r\nAs in most school situations initially responding to class assignments\r\nand involvement in new clinical situations consumed my time and thwarted\r\nmy personal, professional interests. When I commented on this my\r\ninterests were interpreted to me as a desire to live in the past. Living\r\nin the present was recommended and terms like \"up-to-date\" and\r\n\"progressive\" were employed. I felt stopped cold. I had never viewed\r\nmyself as old fashioned or non-progressive. Many of my past nursing\r\nexperiences were still avant-garde as compared with general current\r\npractices.\r\n\r\nThere was something different though in recalling and reflecting on the\r\npast as opposed to current experiences. One's past would be visible in\r\nview of how one approached and experienced the present.\r\nSelf-confrontation moved me beyond confining myself either to the past\r\nor to the present. In my writings one could detect a comparison of what\r\nhad been known with what was coming to be known. It was as if a light of\r\na different hue lit up the whole--past and present--as a different\r\nscene. Similarly I viewed and experienced my clinical experience\r\ndifferently. I gained awareness of a quality of my being that always had\r\nbeen there, but which I hid. Now I valued this part, struggled with it,\r\nand expressed it directly with courage, integrity, and pride. The power\r\nwith which this self-actualization imbued me has been sculpturing my \"I\"\r\ninto a form of my choosing ever more acceptable to me, and accepting of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\r\nConcept Development\r\n\r\nIn a nursing theory course the final assignment was: develop a concept\r\nrelevant to nursing. Again I found myself struggling. The didactically\r\nstated importance of investing precious time and energy into\r\nconstructing a synthetic conceptualization of a term eluded me. Time and\r\nenergy spent to better understand man as he was known to me in the\r\nnursing situation seemed so limited. In these situations persons were\r\nexpressing so many things at one time, how could the conceptualization\r\nof one term be relevant. Finally I understood: no one was saying that\r\nany one term could equate any particular or group of {98} nursing\r\nsituations. They were saying that to communicate the nature or\r\nexperience of nursing with words, to develop nursing theory, relevant\r\nterms needed clarification as to the meaning they conveyed and\r\ndelineation as to their inclusiveness and exclusiveness.\r\n\r\nAs this struggle subsided I could hear, \"a term could be developed as a\r\nconcept or synthetic construct if one conceptualized its why, what, how,\r\nwhen, and where and how these interrelated.\" In approaching concept\r\ndevelopment the last but not least hurdle was, what term did I consider\r\nrelevant enough in nursing to expend this precious time and energy on\r\nconsidering the many possibilities. The first term I began to\r\nintellectually play with was \"ambivalence.\" Now, I would attribute my\r\nselection of \"ambivalence\" to my then existing ambivalence about\r\nconceptualizing a synthetic construct. Then, I based its selection only\r\non its existence in my clinical nursing world. I was working\r\ntherapeutically on a regular, individual basis with an ambivalent\r\nadolescent male labeled diagnostically as a paranoid schizophrenic. I\r\nbegan to consider my clinically recorded data of my sessions with Bob\r\nthrough ambivalence. What were the relationships between why, how, what,\r\nwhen, and where Bob expressed ambivalence?\r\n\r\nStruggling with the term \"ambivalence\" involved and interested me in\r\nconcept development. During this phase I overcame my fear of exposing my\r\nthoughts, I took the risk, and my courage had the upper hand.\r\nNevertheless, another choice had to be made since now I was not willing\r\nto invest this much time on conceptualizing \"ambivalence\" as so relevant\r\nto nursing. Perhaps this signified that my own ambivalence had\r\ndissipated. And again, I faced the question, what term would I want to\r\ndevelop as a synthetic construct?\r\n\r\nThe next question that occurred to me was, what term would indicate why,\r\nas a nurse, I am in the clinical health-nursing situation? Did I view my\r\nvalue mainly as growth, health, freedom, or openness promotion? I worked\r\nfor a while with each of these terms and eventually discarded them. Some\r\nlong-hospitalized persons with whom I was working on a demonstration\r\npsychiatric unit to prepare them for a more independent and appropriate\r\nform of community living would never be stably balanced in health,\r\ngrowing, freedom or openness. For many, these could be only flitting\r\nmemorable beautiful moments. Still I believed I was very much there in\r\nthe nursing situation for these persons, as well as for those who moved\r\ninto the community and found work and social satisfactions. Something\r\noccurred between all of these 15 patients and myself--and that was\r\nnursing.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMFORT: WHY\r\n\r\nWhile considering what construct to conceptualize, I was in the process\r\nof recording my three-hour, twice a week interactions in the\r\ndemonstration unit. I reflected on these interactions and waited for the\r\ndata to reveal to me the major value underlying my nursing practice.\r\nThen the term \"comfort\" came {99} to mind. Perhaps at this point I\r\nbecame comfortable in this unit, or perhaps the unit, itself, became a\r\nmore comfortable setting. When I had first begun my experience with this\r\ndemonstration unit, it was still being planned and the hospital was new\r\nto me. However, the term \"comfort\" has long been associated with\r\nnursing. One can find it as a historical constant throughout the\r\nprofessional nursing literature. The term had been used recently in an\r\nANA publication.[2] When I considered the idea of comforting in nursing\r\npractice I felt such experiences had fulfilled and satisfied me, made me\r\nfeel adequate. I could recall specific experiences that went back to my\r\ninitial nursing practice settings. I could conceive of comfort as an\r\numbrella under which all the other terms--growth, health, freedom, and\r\nopenness--could be sheltered. Some of my contemporaries scoffed and\r\nviewed this term as much too trivial.\r\n\r\nNow, again reviewing my months of gathered clinical data, I sorted out\r\n12 nurse behaviors that I viewed as aiming toward patient comfort. They\r\nwere:\r\n\r\n     1. I focused on recognizing patients by name, being certain I\r\n     was correct about their names, and using their names often and\r\n     appropriately. I also introduced myself. Names were viewed as\r\n     supportive to the internalization of personal identification,\r\n     dignity, and worth.\r\n\r\n     2. I interpreted, taught, and gave as much honest information\r\n     as I could about patients' situations when it was sought or\r\n     when puzzlement was apparent. This was based in the belief that\r\n     it was their life, and choice was their prerogative as they\r\n     were their own projects.\r\n\r\n     3. I verbalized my acceptance of patients' expressions of\r\n     feeling with explanations of why I experienced these feelings\r\n     of acceptance when I could do this authentically and\r\n     appropriately.\r\n\r\n     4. When verbalizations of acceptance were not appropriate, I\r\n     acted out this acceptance by staying with or doing for when\r\n     appropriate.\r\n\r\n     5. I expressed purposely, to burst asunder negative\r\n     self-concepts, my authentic human tender feelings for patients\r\n     when appropriate and acceptable.\r\n\r\n     6. I supported patients' rights to agape-type love\r\n     relationships with others: families, other staff, and other\r\n     patients.\r\n\r\n     7. I showed respect for patients as persons with the right to\r\n     make as many choices for themselves as their current\r\n     capabilities allowed.\r\n\r\n     8. I attempted to help patients consider their currently\r\n     expressed feelings and behaviors in light of past life\r\n     experiences and patterns, like and unlike their current ones.\r\n     {100}\r\n\r\n     9. I encouraged patients' expression to better understand their\r\n     behavioral messages and to enable me to respond overtly as\r\n     therapeutically as possible.\r\n\r\n     10. I verified my intuitive grasp of how patients were\r\n     experiencing events by questions and comments and being alert\r\n     to their responses.\r\n\r\n     11. I attempted to encourage hope realistically through\r\n     discussing individual therapeutic gains that could be derived\r\n     from patients' investment in therapeutic opportunities\r\n     available to them.\r\n\r\n     12. I supported appropriate patient self-images with as many\r\n     concrete \"hard to denies\" as possible.\r\n\r\nEach of these nurse behaviors was repeatedly evident in the months of\r\nrecording patient-nurse interactions. For the conceptualization of the\r\nterm \"comfort,\" a representative clinical example was given to enhance\r\nthe meaning of the behavior cited (see Appendix). When compiling\r\nmaterials for the conceptualization of this term, I found 12 assumptions\r\nabout psychiatric nursing that I had written for the theory course in\r\none of the first class sessions. Although these assumptions were\r\nexpressed in different words, their congruence with my 12 selected\r\nbehaviors made me believe that these behaviors were somehow verified\r\nboth in my conceptualized philosophy of psychiatric nursing and in my\r\nbehavior while being a psychiatric nurse.\r\n\r\nNext I struggled with an idealistic conception of comfort as opposed to\r\na continuum of behavior which would indicate a person's degree or state\r\nof discomfort-comfort. Again, reflecting on and teasing out aspects of\r\nmy data, I set up four behaviorally recognizable criteria for estimating\r\na person's discomfort-comfort state:\r\n\r\n     1. Relationships with other persons which confirm one as an\r\n     existent important person.\r\n\r\n     2. Affective adaptation to the environment in accord with\r\n     knowledge, potential, and values.\r\n\r\n     3. Awareness of and response to the reality of the now with\r\n     understanding of the influence of and separation from the past.\r\n\r\n     4. Appreciation and recognition of both powers and limitations\r\n     which enlighten the alternatives of the future.\r\n\r\nThese behavioral criteria, too, could each be spread on a continuum to\r\nevaluate the effects of this aim of nursing on a patient's actual\r\ncomfort status at any particular point in time.\r\n\r\nConsidering the concept of comfort as a proper aim of psychiatric\r\nnursing brought forth the necessity of considering its opposite,\r\ndiscomfort, as a concept. Evidence for the existence of discomfort could\r\nbe inferred in the absence of the above behavioral criteria. {101}\r\n\r\nThe basic foundation to justify the concept of comfort as a proper aim\r\nof psychiatric nursing would be both organic and environmental. In our\r\nculture, among the species man, we are moving toward being able to\r\neffect some organic conditions by genetic controls and surgical and\r\nchemical means. The professions have struggled long years to influence\r\nenvironmental deterrents to comfort. If an individual as a fetus, or as\r\nan infant, or young child never internalizes comfort of any kind from\r\nhis environs, the probability of initiating a continuum within himself\r\nas an adult that is propelled toward comfort seems unlikely. Such\r\nindividuals, lacking any potential capacity for comfort, I suspect are\r\nrare. There is evidence for the existence of this dormant seed of\r\ncomfort in persons with schizophrenia in the hospital setting. Consider\r\nhow repetitively and ambivalently they \"reach out\" to authority figures.\r\nThis dormant comfort seed requires nourishment of a high quality for\r\ntesting whether it can develop and bear the fruits of health, growth,\r\nfreedom, and openness.\r\n\r\nWhen the development of this synthetic construct of comfort was\r\ndiscussed in the theory course a question was raised: Is a person who\r\ndenies all feeling, presents himself as emotionally dead, comfortable?\r\nIf feelings are not relegated to the mind alone, as the effects of a\r\npeptic ulcer cannot be relegated to the stomach, if feelings are an\r\nessential of the nature of humanness, a human who denies this essential\r\nof his nature would not fit into this concept as comfortable. This\r\nsynthetic construct of comfort, like its synonym contentment, described\r\nby Plutarch A.D. 46-120, does not imply passivity, resignation,\r\nretirement, or a simple avoiding of trouble. Plutarch said, \"Contentment\r\ncomes very dear if its price is inactivity.\"[3] I would perceive of\r\ncomfort or contentment as implying that a human being was all he could\r\nbe in accordance with his potential at any particular time in any\r\nparticular situation.\r\n\r\nContinuing the aforementioned twelve nurse behaviors, observing behavior\r\nthrough the four established criteria and conceptualizing the construct\r\nof comfort, I began to wonder. Was I seeing what I had decided was the\r\nstate of psychiatric patients' conditions of being? Was I projecting\r\ndiscomfort onto patients? I did not expect straight answers.\r\nNonetheless, I decided to ask patients about their discomfort-comfort\r\nstates to verify my perception of the condition of their beings. All\r\nfourteen patients I asked assured me by their responses that I was not\r\nprojecting or seeing discomfort where it did not exist.\r\n\r\nSome described physical discomfort and sought the cause within and\r\noutside themselves (either another caused it, or another could cure it,\r\npills would cure it), negatively viewed self-images, guilt based in\r\ntheir behaviors or thoughts. One patient defined comfort by analogy and\r\nstated directly to my surprise that he seldom felt comfortable and that\r\nhis excessive ritualistic behavior was his way of coping with his\r\ndiscomfort. One repetitively stated a happy illusion that he seemed to\r\nhang on to for dear life. When I asked what he would do if this illusion\r\nwas not truth, he said that he had never considered {102} this\r\npossibility. I knew he had been confronted with the truth of his\r\nsituation many times in many ways. One patient merely looked directly at\r\nme and walked away.\r\n\r\nThen I again reviewed my clinical recorded data to see what kinds of\r\nknowledge nursing with an aim to comfort would infer as necessary.\r\nFifty-two items of knowledge were extrapolated from the clinical\r\nexamples selected as representative of the twelve nurse behaviors. These\r\nitems were categorized under broad cognitive and affective domains. This\r\nwas an arbitrary point of separation. They were teased apart simply as\r\nan aid to conceptualization and understanding. If these knowledge\r\ndomains had related to one another in a simple direct manner, I would\r\nhave conveyed them in a table in which each would have been across from\r\nits mate. Their relationships to one another were far too complex to be\r\nhandled in any such a way. The affective domain knowledge areas were a\r\ndynamic internalized synthesis of several knowledge areas from the\r\ncognitive domain. Thus, the expression of these affective knowledge\r\nareas was evidence of the practice of nursing as an artful form of\r\nexpressing cognitive knowing.\r\n\r\nIn looking directly at the discomfort of long-term hospitalized\r\npsychiatric patients, I found myself faced with behaviors that resulted\r\npossibly from a muddle of many contributories. What in the behavior\r\nresulted from lifetime environmental influences and compounded responses\r\nthat deepened scars? What resulted from long-term hospitalization? How\r\nmany varieties of ills superimposed like layers on the above were\r\nexpressed in what I saw as discomfort in these psychiatric patients?\r\nDiagnostic classifications are necessary for statistical economic\r\nplanning reasons. Still, how naively and superficially they convey the\r\nhuman therapeutic care needs of each person.\r\n\r\nAt this point of construct development I saw a positive relationship in\r\nmy thinking about comfort as a proper aim of psychiatric nursing and\r\nViktor Frankl's description of his aim in logotherapy toward meaning. I\r\nhad struggled with the idea of aiming at comfort while with patients who\r\npossessed ability and a favorable prognosis, often purposefully and\r\ndeliberately asking them to consider ideas that caused them immediate\r\ngreater discomfort. Frankl's quotes from Nietzsche and Goethe supported\r\nmy altruistic intention. Nietzsche said:\r\n\r\n     \"He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.\"[4]\r\n\r\nGoethe said:\r\n\r\n     \"When we take man as he is, we make him worse; but when we take\r\n     man as if he were already what he should be, we promote him to\r\n     what he can be.\"[5]\r\n\r\nIn conclusion to this stage of development of a synthetic construct of\r\ncomfort as an aim of psychiatric nursing I can say: Comfort is an aim\r\ntoward {103} which persons' conditions of being move through\r\nrelationship with others by internalizing freedom from painful\r\ncontrolling effects of the past. These effects have inhibited their\r\nself-control, realistic planning, and prevented them from being all that\r\nthey could be in accordance with their potential at any particular time\r\nin any particular situation. I would project this as an aim for nursing\r\nin all situations although the data for constructing this\r\nconceptualization were gathered in a clinical psychiatric setting.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLINICAL: HOW\r\n\r\nAs a component of my doctoral examinations I was faced with having to\r\nrewrite a clinical paper. This led to my deliberately and personally\r\nchoosing to conceptualize a synthetic construct of \"clinical.\" This was\r\nmy decision. It speaks well for the value of having had the experience\r\nof conceptualizing \"comfort.\" Often it is said that man repeats that\r\nwhich he finds as meaningful and good. This choice also signifies a real\r\novercoming of my resistance and ambivalence toward synthetic construct\r\ndevelopment in a year's time.\r\n\r\n\"Clinical\" was developed as a synthetic construct in 1968. It was a\r\nconceptualized response to a dialectical process within myself. If I am\r\na clinician, then \"how\" I am in the health-nursing situation would\r\nequate to \"clinical.\" In conceptualizing this construct I teased out of\r\nmy lived-nursing-world the \"how\" of my working toward my own and others'\r\ncomfort.\r\n\r\nConfusion, over what was meant when persons casually and currently\r\npopularly attributed the term \"clinical\" to situations and persons,\r\ncalled forth this conceptualization. It grew out of comparing and\r\ncontrasting two nursing consultation experiences in the\r\npsychiatric-mental health area. Beginning this conceptualization I would\r\nhave referred to both these experiences as \"clinical.\" At the\r\ntermination of the conceptualization they were both \"clinical.\" They\r\nwere very different experiences for me, and yet of equal value in my\r\nadvancement toward my more of being. Prior to this conceptualization\r\nbecause my attending emotions were so disturbing and unacceptable to me\r\nin relation to one of these experiences, automatically I repressed part\r\nof them and found reasons to suppress the rest of them. Unfortunately,\r\nall else that was of value to me in having lived this experience was\r\nintegrally enmeshed with these emotions. This, too, became unavailable\r\nto my conscious awareness. Conceptualization made recall and reflection\r\na necessity. Clinical includes inherently a process of experiencing\r\nawarely and then recalling, looking at, reflecting on, and sorting out\r\nto come to knowing.\r\n\r\nBefore knowing how to approach the rewriting of my clinical paper as a\r\npartial requirement for receiving my doctoral degree I experienced a\r\ndepression. I felt frightened, angry, and inadequate. The original\r\nclinical paper had been judged as more intellectual and scholarly than\r\nclinical. I could conceive of only two alternatives. Both seemed\r\nself-defeating. One, I could revise my former clinical paper into a more\r\nintellectual and scholarly paper that still {104} would not be clinical\r\nand would still leave my \"I\" out. Or, two, I could revise my former\r\nclinical paper, dump all my feelings in the situational experience,\r\nblame everyone else for these feelings, and culminate at least with my\r\nclinical passions visible. Conflict resulted from my considering\r\npursuing either of these routes. I was immobilized for a time. A time\r\nlimitation and time passing pushed me to begin somewhere. I began.\r\nChoosing the second alternative in the belief that at least through\r\nwriting I would better understand what I had lived in the experience.\r\n\r\nI could support the value of dredging up these old feelings and looking\r\nat them. Authentically letting myself be aware of what I had\r\nexperienced, not necessarily communicating this or acting out in\r\naccordance with these redredged feelings; just really looking at them\r\nmight allow me choice in how I wanted to live with them. One support for\r\nthe value of looking at these old feelings was my own past three and\r\none-half years in psychoanalysis in which I profited through such a\r\nprocess. The other support was my readings of the past two years. These\r\nincluded works of Russell,[6] Nietzsche,[7] Plato,[8] Popper,[9]\r\nDewey,[10] Buber,[11] Bergson,[12] Cousins,[13] and de Chardin.[14]\r\n\r\nAs this experience became in shape and meaning through my writing, I\r\nbegan to view this product as like an existential play filled with\r\nblatant atrocities and absurdities that had to be nonrealities. This\r\nproduction, also, made visible beautiful raw data. As meaning in this\r\nclinical nursing consultation experience as a graduate student became\r\nevident, comparison of it with the meaning of clinical work experiences\r\nin nursing consultation situations flowed naturally. Then joy, it was\r\nlike sunshine burst forth and warmed my spirit.\r\n\r\nBefore entering school, I was, for two years, a mental health\r\npsychiatric clinical nurse consultant to a staff of forty-five visiting\r\nnurses. I had become intrigued {105} with what I had come to understand\r\nabout consultation related to clinical situations. I wrote a paper for\r\npublication on the subject. Busy in the process of returning to school,\r\nand awaiting the publication of two other papers--both of these\r\nproceedings feeling unreal and out of my control, not to mention\r\nself-exposing--I merely filed in my desk the typed submittable rendition\r\nof this consultation paper. Now, I dug it out. This meant that I had two\r\nconceptualized presentations of similar type personal experiences in\r\nnursing consultation to compare and contrast. From these, my\r\nconceptualization of clinical, and the values on which my clinical\r\npractice rests, could be extrapolated.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Student Consultation Experience Becomes Clinical\r\n\r\nIn the graduate student nurse consultation experience I felt helpless,\r\nconfused, unwanted, guilty, anxious, and unimportant. It was a\r\npassion-filled experience for me. As a nurse-student consultant among\r\ninterdisciplinary nonstudent-consultants I experienced dependency for my\r\nbeing and doing on persons I viewed as anxious, critical, nonempathetic,\r\nand inadequate. We were attempting to offer consultation to a\r\nprofessional group of nonpsychiatric mental health oriented consultees\r\nwho were anxious and felt inadequate in this area. I felt forced into an\r\nobserver rather than participant mode of being, and my recorded data\r\nsupport this. Impotency comes to mind when I recall this experience, as\r\nwell as a racking rage and suffering that obliterates feelings of love,\r\ngood-will, tenderness, or hope. About that time I was reading\r\nNietzsche's eternal recurrence phenomenon[15] and viewed it most\r\npessimistically--all was awful, it would continue to be awful, life was\r\njust a vicious cycle of awfulness.\r\n\r\nDefense or health, it is questionable. Suddenly, perhaps it was having\r\nhit feelings of rock bottom, I began to view Nietzsche's eternal\r\nrecurrence phenomenon optimistically. Did the polarization of my\r\nnegative feelings magnetically call forth my opposite feelings? All,\r\nnow, contained the new, it would continue to contain the new, life was a\r\nseries of similar and yet different cycles that always contained the\r\nnew.\r\n\r\nNow my reflections let in hope, positiveness, comradeship, good\r\nfeelings, and progress made by myself and others in our year and a half\r\ntogether as consultants. During this period we met with the consultees\r\nfor an hour once or twice a week. The group had continued over this\r\nperiod despite its components of psychiatric mental health professionals\r\nand nonpsychiatric mental health profession culturally, professionally,\r\nand historically having been quite alienated from one another.\r\nAttendance had improved some over time. Toward the end of the year and a\r\nhalf, during the last three months, the focus of discussion was on\r\npatients and their worlds for longer periods of time. There was less\r\ndefensive acting out in which things, fees, time, and mechanics consumed\r\nthe hour.\r\n\r\n{106}\r\n\r\nToward the end of these sessions the consultant chief found more\r\nacceptable space in which to meet for the consultation. Eating lunch\r\nbecame part of the session. Food can be looked at in many ways. In this\r\ncase it seemed to be a cohesive force, rather than a distracting,\r\nsocializing force. Was this because of the underlying meanings food had\r\nfor these people? Or was the meaning of food in this situation concrete?\r\nNow the consultees could have their lunch served to them while receiving\r\nconsultation. This latter saved their time and meant money to them. This\r\nwas a giving gesture on the part of the consultants even though the\r\nlunch monies did come out of the project funding source. The meaning of\r\nfood was never discussed in the group. I wonder if this feeding was done\r\nwith deliberate awareness or was just serendipitous.\r\n\r\nDuring the last three months of meeting I began to feel related on a\r\ndeeper level with a few of the participants, consultants and consultees.\r\nIndividual to individual we began to communicate collaboratively with\r\none another as professional colleagues. We discussed both patients'\r\nlived worlds and the meaning of psychiatric mental health terms and\r\nideas. I can conceive, now, that this may have occurred between other\r\ngroup members before or after sessions. Initially there were often only\r\ntwo to three consultees to five or six consultants. Later the total\r\ngroup contained fifteen to sixteen people. Now I would project that the\r\nvery existence of this group could influence future groups positively.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Clinical Work Consultation Experience\r\n\r\nIn this work consultation experience my feelings were openness,\r\nreflectiveness, pain, helpfulness, alertness, searchfulness,\r\nappreciativeness, receptiveness, responsiveness, wantedness, competence,\r\njoy, and importance. It was both a passionate and a dispassionate\r\nexperience. As a working consultant I met with consultees either alone\r\nor as part of a collaborating team of consultants. Often the situations\r\nthe consultees presented which they struggled with and stayed in struck\r\nme with awe. They aroused my humility while making me feel whole and\r\nfulfilled in my participation with the consultees. In my explorations of\r\nand with the consultees my presence, thereness, and authenticity were\r\nall important. Buber would say that my aim in consultation was to\r\n\"imagine the real\" of what the consultee and the patients and families\r\nshe discussed with me \"could be.\"[16] This was my initial disposition. I\r\naimed to be open to and accept the potentials of these others.\r\n\r\nIn initial receptiveness, grounded in my comfort, was the \"key\" to the\r\n\"door\" of the consultant-consultee \"I-Thou\" relation in which I could\r\ncome to know intuitively the experience of this particular other\r\nnurse-in-her-lived-nursing-world. The consultees offered their\r\nlived-nursing-worlds each in their unique ways. Some discussed directly\r\ntheir pains, joys, adequacies, and inadequacies. Some discussed\r\nindirectly their panic, success, action, and immobilization. Some beyond\r\nbeing able to discuss their lived-worlds {107} spontaneously acted out\r\ntheir lived-worlds. For example, these often behaved toward me as their\r\npatients and families behaved toward them. These kinds of acted out\r\nlived-worlds I had to sense my way into to understand. When I began to\r\nwonder what it was that they wanted from consultation to take back to\r\ntheir lived-nursing-worlds, I would pull out of the \"I-Thou\" form of\r\nrelating. This wonderment became my conscious clue. It was time to\r\nreflect and look at what my explorations had uncovered.\r\n\r\nAt this point transcending this \"I-Thou\" relation, I would look at \"It.\"\r\nSeeing, now, what was within me, what the condition of my being was that\r\nI had intuitively taken on from the consultee, I would set it apart from\r\nmyself, and see it as an empathic response. I knew that these feelings I\r\nexperienced which I received existentially, globally through the\r\ncompound of the consultee's words, tone inflection, volume, facial\r\nexpression, posture, and positioning to me were what she experienced in\r\nher-nursing world. Verbalization of this empathized understanding\r\nfulfilled several purposes: (1) it conveyed my sympathy or joy with, and\r\nalways my caring, (2) it validated that I saw it as it was for this\r\nnurse, and (3) it opened the door to our working through the possible\r\nmeanings of the nurse's experience and to speculating about outcomes of\r\nalternative future nurse actions and behaviors.\r\n\r\nCognitively the range of these consultation discussions was broad. Some\r\ncommon themes were social and health histories of families, pertinent\r\npsychological growth and development factors of persons in the families\r\nof concern to the consultees, relationships between persons within the\r\nsituations, resources available to the families, ways the consultees\r\ncould relate with the parents and patients' families, friends, and other\r\nprofessionals in the situation, and the meaning of all these themes to\r\nthe particular consultee.\r\n\r\nThis clinical consultation experience necessitated my being certain\r\nways. It necessitated my being authentic with myself with regard to what\r\nresponses were called forth in me in relating with a particular\r\nconsultee. I viewed honesty with the consultee as a value necessary to\r\nthe consultation process. In approaching the consultation I needed to be\r\nopen to the consultee's angular view and predisposed toward an \"I-Thou\"\r\nrelationship. The \"I-Thou\" relating necessitated subsequent scientific\r\nunderstanding extrapolated from it through reflection on it as \"I-It.\"\r\nMy hope in consultation was to offer both a cognitive, as well as, an\r\nontic experience in which a mutual feeling apart from and toward the\r\nother would exist. This latter seemed most important to me. If the\r\nconsultee experienced my being authentically present with her, she then\r\nwould be apt to offer this type of relationship to the patients and\r\nfamilies of concern to her.\r\n\r\n\r\nResults of Comparison\r\n\r\nThe two clinical consultation experiences were juxtaposed, contrasted,\r\nquestioned, related, and synthesized to envision their unified\r\ncontribution to the construct of \"clinical.\" The synthetic construct of\r\n\"clinical\" is not viewed as a mere juxtaposing, a disintegrating, or\r\nreconstructing of the contributions {108} to my knowing from either of\r\nthese experiences. This comparison is viewed as a facing of the\r\nmultiplicities they both present. The synthesis is an illumination of\r\nboth experiences with each transfigured through their mutual presence in\r\nthe \"knowing place\" of the comparer.[17]\r\n\r\nIn this comparison my appreciation grew of how I had uniquely\r\nimplemented and conceptualized clinical consultation in my work\r\nexperience. I recognized through the comparison that adequate clinical\r\nconsultation demands both a passionate and dispassionate phase of\r\n\"I-Thou\" and \"I-It\" relating. Without either of these forms of\r\nconsultant being-in-the-situation we degrade the term \"clinical\" if we\r\nemploy it. Consultation lends itself naturally to a collaborative\r\ncooperative relationship. The consultant is dependent on the consultee\r\nfor presentation of the specifics of particular situations. The\r\nconsultee is dependent on the consultant for the tailoring of general\r\nknowledge to the consultees' particular situations. The relationship if\r\nappropriately called consultation is then of necessity interdependent.\r\nIn being separate from the other while feeling with the other the\r\nconsultant does not lose the ability to question. Passion undealt with\r\nor identification with the consultee inhibits the clinical purpose of\r\nthe consultant and of the consultation. In identification one feels as\r\nif he were the other, rather than turning to the other and feeling with\r\nhim. The degree of anxiety this provokes in the consultant can prevent\r\nlooking at the consultation situation and issues in an \"I-It\" manner.\r\nThe consultant loses the ability to question.\r\n\r\nThrough this comparison I was able to reflect on the graduate student\r\nnursing consultation experience in an \"I-It\" way. At this time it became\r\na \"clinical\" experience for me. The lack of this reflective phase in\r\nthis experience highlighted the reflective phase already existent in the\r\nworking clinical consultation experience. The existence of this phase in\r\nthe working clinical consultation experience highlighted its absence in\r\nthe graduate student nursing consultation experience. My commonplace\r\nnursing world through this comparison became awarely meaningful and\r\navailed itself for conceptualization. A situation is not a \"clinical\"\r\nexperience until the \"would be\" clinician can reflect, analyze,\r\ncategorize, and synthesize it.\r\n\r\n\r\nClinical Is\r\n\r\nA potentially clinical psychiatric mental health situation becomes\r\n\"clinical\" if the clinician relates to the helpee to awaken his unique\r\npotential or ontic wholeness, and noetically transcending this relating\r\nconceptualizes its meaning.\r\n\r\nClinician signifies a particular mode of being and a particular kind of\r\ncognitive knowledge. With all his human capacity the clinician relates\r\nwith his clinical-world consciously and deliberately in \"I-Thou,\" and\r\n\"I-It.\"\r\n\r\nRelating in \"I-Thou\" with the other in-his-clinical-world the clinician\r\ngives himself and receives back the other and himself in the sphere of\r\n\"the between.\" {109} He knows the other and the more of himself in this\r\nrelating. He is confirmed and confirms the other through the other's\r\npresence with him. Thus, he calls forth the other's actualizing of self\r\nthrough the clinical relationship. In accepting the other as he is the\r\nclinician imagines and responds to the reality of his potential for\r\nbecoming, becoming according to his unique capacity for humanness.\r\n\r\nRelating in \"I-It\" with his clinical world the clinician noetically\r\ntranscends himself, objectifies himself, and studies his \"I-Thou\"\r\nknowing. He teases it apart. He classifies and studies it. He asks it\r\nquestions. He compares and contrasts it to other clinical experiences.\r\nHe discusses its many aspects in dialogue with his \"inward,\" and\r\npossibly \"outward\" \"Thous.\" He reorders its parts. He shapes, creates,\r\nplans from and for its clinical existence. Thus, he ever augments a\r\nworld of heuristic knowing.\r\n\r\nThis \"how\" allows the clinical fulfillment of my nursing \"why.\" Comfort\r\nis \"why\" I, as a nurse, am in the health-nursing situation. As\r\nconceptualized \"comfort\" is being able to freely control and plan for\r\none's self, being fully in accord at a particular time, in a particular\r\nsituation, with one's unique potential. Now, \"what\" is the nature of the\r\nnurse's world, the health-nursing situation?\r\n\r\n\r\nALL-AT-ONCE: WHAT\r\n\r\nThe term \"all-at-once,\" arose within me as a construct that would\r\nmetaphorically describe the multifarious multiplicities that exist\r\nwithin nursing situations. Completing my comparison of Gilbert's and\r\nMuller's written works to grasp how they viewed the nature of\r\npsychiatric mental health nursing I found myself mulling over and\r\nfussing.[18] Your question is probably, mulling and fussing over what?\r\nWhile I mulled over and fussed I believe I, too, was perplexed. Why was\r\nI unsatisfied?\r\n\r\nI had compared Gilbert's and Muller's writing styles, their conceptions\r\nof man, approaches to nursing, nursing education, supervision, and\r\nconsultation. Their similarities and differences were noted, and how\r\neach presented herself predominantly. Then I cited the nursing\r\ncommunities they sought to influence and those in which they were while\r\nwriting. Through reviewing their bibliographies and biographies I\r\nindicated the sources that had influenced them.\r\n\r\nStill I mulled over, fussed, and was perplexed. I awakened in the middle\r\nof one night in 1969 understanding what had been causing my struggle.\r\nThe \"all-at-once\" was my answer.\r\n\r\nThe description of single constructs and single examples originally had\r\nfelt unrelated to the reality of the nurse's world. They oversimplified\r\nits complexity. The nature of nursing was complex. It seemed to me that\r\nwe needed, as a profession, constructs that simplified and allowed clear\r\ncommunications. We, also, needed constructs that conveyed the reality\r\nand complexity of the {110} worlds in which nurses nursed. Perhaps a\r\ndescription of what \"all-at-once\" expressed for me would convey to\r\nothers the lived-unobservable-worlds of nurses.\r\n\r\nNurses relate to other man in situations of \"all-at-once.\" The\r\n\"all-at-once\" is equated by me to Buber's \"I-Thou\" and \"I-It\" occurring\r\nsimultaneously and not only in sequence as he expressed it. These two\r\nways that man can relate to and come to know his world and himself\r\ndemand sequential expression for clear communication. However, the\r\nresponsible authentic nurse in the nursing arena lives them\r\n\"all-at-once.\" Aware of the multifarious multiplicities of her responses\r\nto another and at once to the surrounding field of action, the nurse\r\nselects and overtly expresses her responses that actualize the purpose,\r\nvalues, and potential of the artful science of professional nursing.\r\n\r\nAwareness of the multifarious multiplicities affecting the other and the\r\nself in the nursing arena is a component of \"I-Thou\" relating.\r\nSelectively overtly expressing concordantly with the purpose, values,\r\nand potential of nursing necessitates a looking at, which is a component\r\nof \"I-It\" relating, while acting and being. Therefore both \"I-Thou and\r\nI-It\" modes of being are \"all-at-once.\"\r\n\r\nThis necessity for a nurse's duality in her mode of being came to my\r\nawareness through comparing Gilbert' and Muller's works, studying\r\nBuber's conceptions of man, and considering them in relation to my\r\ncurrent and past lived-experiences in the nursing-arena. In my nursing\r\nworld of \"I-Thou\" relating reflection is called forth prior to my overt\r\nresponse to allow response selection concordant with my nursing purpose.\r\nThe very character of multifarious multiplicities of the nursing world\r\nundoubtedly has called for nurses to develop their human capacity for\r\nduality in their mode of being.\r\n\r\nTo make these \"multifarious multiplicities\" explicit I would like to\r\noffer a description of a recent, personal nursing experience. In a\r\ncommunity psychiatric mental health psychosocial clinic, I sat across\r\nfrom and focused on relating with a psychiatric client. After long years\r\nof hospitalization he was now living in a community foster home and\r\nvisiting the clinic three days a week. When there was no special clinic\r\nactivity in progress and often even when there was, he sat by himself\r\nand played poker. He told me about his game many times, over weeks and\r\nmonths. He dealt out five poker hands. Each hand was dealt to a member\r\nof his family, long dead. He did not accept their deadness. One day\r\nwhile describing the poker games and his relatives, he intermittently\r\nexpressed his fantasies which he projected on to a sweet cheerful\r\n65-year-old community volunteer. She was somewhat deaf. His fantasies\r\nwere angry. When he gestured toward her, she in a motherly way came over\r\nto him, put her arm around him, and her ear down to his mouth. It was a\r\nmoment of possible client explosion. With my eyes I attempted to\r\ncommunicate with her. This, and the tone of the patient's voice warned\r\nher to move away. While this was occurring another patient jealous of my\r\nattentions to this patient walked up and down, and in passing negatively\r\ncommented on the religious background of the man I was sitting with. In\r\nthe rear of the room a dietician was conducting a group on obesity. And\r\nall of this was set to the {111} melodious, sanguine strains of \"If I\r\nLoved You\" being poorly beat out on a piano about ten feet away by\r\nanother volunteer accompanied in song by a few clients. Meanwhile two\r\nstaff nurses were observing my part in all this since I was labeled\r\n\"expert.\" The client did support me that day and responded to my staying\r\nwith him. Much to my surprise he began playing poker with me. He dealt\r\nme out a hand. This was, at this time, a new behavior on his part. It\r\nwas movement toward his potential for relating to live persons in his\r\ncurrent world. This, again, is just one example of the multifarious\r\nmultiplicities of one very common type of nursing situation.\r\n\r\nThe inference from the above is that professional artistic-scientific\r\nnurses relate in \"I-Thou, I-It, all-at-once\" to the specific general,\r\ncritical nonconsequential, and the healthy ill. This presents a\r\nparadoxical dilemma. Nurses, as human beings, have a highly developed\r\ncapacity for living \"all-at-once\" in and with the flow of the\r\nmultifarious multiplicities of their worlds. Nurses, as human beings,\r\nlike all other human beings, are limited to thinking, interpreting, and\r\nexpressing conceptually only in succession.\r\n\r\nThis metaphoric synthetic construct, \"all-at-once,\" has allowed me to\r\nbetter convey how I experience the health nursing situation. It also has\r\naided my understanding of the multifarious multiplicity of angular views\r\nexpressed by several professionals in responding to and describing a\r\nsimilar situation. I can accept each description as truth for each\r\nresponder. Each responds with his uniqueness in the situation.\r\nComparing, contrasting, and complementarily synthesizing these multiple\r\nviews inclusive of their inconsistencies and contradictions, none\r\nnegating the other, allows a better understanding of man-in-his-world in\r\nthe health situation than the so frequently presented oversimplifications.\r\nThese oversimplified presentations usually deal only with what is\r\noccurring that is important to the particular interests of the reporter.\r\nAnd they are offered only after the selected material has been put\r\nthrough a process of interpretation and logical sequencing to emphasize\r\nthe reporter's particular point. In such reporting the existent in the\r\nsituation labeled unimportant, unacceptable, or unrelated is not\r\nconsidered. Such existents, nonetheless, may control the patients, the\r\nfamilies, the nurses and health professionals generally. Their control\r\nmay well be more powerful than any erudite oversimplification or its\r\npresentation.\r\n\r\nHumanistic nursing practice theory in asking for phenomenological\r\ndescriptions of the nurse's lived-world of experiencing proposes\r\nauthentic awareness with the self of what is existent in the situation\r\nprior to conceptualization for dispersal. Unless nurses appreciate and\r\ngive recognition to the dynamic meaningful breadth, depth, and future\r\ninfluence of their worlds the actualization of the potential thrust of\r\nthe nursing professional will never be or become.\r\n\r\n\r\nA THEORY OF NURSING\r\n\r\nA human nurse nurses through a clinical process of \"I-Thou, I-It,\r\nall-at-once to comfort.\" {112}\r\n\r\n\"I-Thou\" is a coming to know the other and the self in relation,\r\nintuitively.\r\n\r\n\"I-It\" is an authentic analyzing, synthesizing, and interpreting of the\r\n\"I-Thou\" relation through reflection.\r\n\r\nThe \"all-at-once\" symbolizes the multifarious multiplicities of extremes\r\n(incommensurables, criticals, nonconsequentials, contradictions, and\r\ninconsistencies) as metaphorically representative of what exists in the\r\nnurse's world.\r\n\r\n\"Comfort\" is a state valued by a nurse as an aim in which a person is\r\nfree to be and become, controlling and planning his own destiny, in\r\naccordance with his potential at a particular time in a particular\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Josephine G.

I quantified\r\nthese behaviors for two months. The following are a list of these\r\nbehaviors with a representative example of all but the first. The first\r\nwas too general and continuous for example.\r\n\r\n\r\n     1. I focused on recognizing patients by name, being certain I\r\n     was correct about their names, and using their names often and\r\n     appropriately. I also introduced myself. Names were viewed as\r\n     supportive to the internalization of personal feelings of\r\n     dignity and worth.\r\n\r\n     2. I interpreted, taught, and gave as much honest information\r\n     as I could about patients' situations when it was sought or\r\n     when puzzlement was apparent. This was based on the belief that\r\n     it was their life, and choice was their prerogative since they\r\n     were their own projects.\r\n\r\n_Examples_\r\n\r\n(a) While drinking coffee with a few patients at the dining room table\r\nsuddenly we could hear Sidney, in his customary way, wailing, moaning,\r\nand muttering in another room. It is a sad sound. I was about to get up\r\nand go to him as I often do, when Arthur, who was sitting next to me,\r\nface working, and tense posture-wise, aggravatedly said, \"Sidney doesn't\r\nhave to do that, he should control himself, the rest of us control\r\nourselves.\" I said, \"When others express how miserable they feel, it\r\nsometimes arouses our own feelings about our misery.\" This was an\r\nattempt to provoke 32-year-old Arthur to work on his own {114} feelings\r\nof misery and to deter his projection of anger at himself out onto\r\nSidney. Arthur looked at me sharply, like he had gotten the message, and\r\nagreed by relaxedly nodding his head.\r\n\r\n(b) Alice, diagnosed as manic depressive, has been depressed. This\r\ndepression dates from her going out to a department store and asking for\r\na job. She was hired for a five-day-a-week job. This was done on her\r\nown. Later her readiness for a five-day-a-week job and her participation\r\nin the unit were questioned. Then Alice became depressed.\r\n\r\nAlice was sitting in the dayroom. I sat down next to her. She looked\r\nvery sad, her eyelids as well as her mouth, drooped. Her mouth worked as\r\nif she wanted to talk, but she was quiet. I asked her about her job\r\ndecision. She said that she had not taken it. I said, \"You look so sad\r\nthat I feel like holding your hand.\" Her hands were in her coat pockets,\r\nbut she looked at me and smiled weakly. I said, \"Sometimes a conflict of\r\nwanting to do two things at once in the present and not being able to\r\ncan bring up the feelings of a past very much more important similar\r\nexperience.\" Alice just shook her head up and down and looked at me.\r\nAlice is in her mid-forties. Later I was walking down the hall to leave\r\nsaying goodbyes to various people. Alice came out of a side room, put\r\nboth her hands out to me, and said, \"goodbye and thank you.\" In a\r\nprevious contact Alice had discussed her suicidal thoughts with me.\r\n\r\n\r\n     3. I verbalized my acceptance of patients' expressions of\r\n     feelings with explanations of why I experienced these feelings\r\n     of acceptance when I could do this authentically and\r\n     appropriately.\r\n\r\n_Example_\r\n\r\nI met a new patient at coffee. Later she was the only patient in the\r\ndayroom when I went in. She had not spoken at coffee. Now she sat very\r\nstiffly in her chair. I sat down next to her and reintroduced myself.\r\nShe looked scared but told me her name. Her shifting eyes reminded me of\r\na cornered animal. She blurted out, \"I don't believe I've met you.\" It\r\nwas like she had said, \"go away.\" I smiled at her and said, \"We were\r\nintroduced at coffee, but with so many new people it's hard to\r\nremember.\" Conversation continued to be tense. At one point Marion\r\nbolted from her chair toward the door. I thought she was going to leave.\r\nI stayed in my chair. She went to the fish bowl in the corner. We\r\ncontinued to talk about the fish. Marion came back and sat down a few\r\nseats away from me. I said that I felt I'd been asking her an awful lot\r\nof questions but that I was only trying to get to know her. Marion\r\nseemed to relax in her chair and gave a great deal of information about\r\nherself in a strange stiff sort of way often inserting a word that did\r\nnot have meaning for me. I encouraged, supported and showed my interest.\r\nFinally she said that she {115} had been admitted to McLean in her\r\nthird year of nurses' training just before her psychiatric experience.\r\nShe had been in therapy there, one-to-one for a couple of years. I\r\nteased her about knowing the ropes, yet giving me a difficult time. This\r\nwas an attempt to increase her feelings of adequacy by bringing out the\r\nsimilarities of the old situation which she knew and this new situation.\r\nFor the first time she really grinned at me, almost laughed. Marion is\r\nin her early thirties.\r\n\r\n\r\n     4. When verbalizations of acceptance were not appropriate, I\r\n     acted out this acceptance by my behavior of staying with or\r\n     doing for when appropriate.\r\n\r\n_Example_\r\n\r\nMary is a middle-aged patient who, on her first days in the unit, was\r\nliberally gobbling her food with alertness for only more to be had. Her\r\nonly rather loud, irrelevant, smiling expression was about her daughter\r\nwho was a go-go dancer, had three children, and whom she had visited\r\ntwice by bus in California. This day she approached me and asked if I\r\nwould file her nails. I said that I would but asked if she knew if there\r\nwas a file in the unit. Another patient offered his. We sat down and I\r\nfiled. The patient poured out a life story full of misery. This was a\r\nside of this patient that I had not perceived. I listened, nodded, and\r\nfiled. The story started in the 1930s about her husband and\r\nmother-in-law's behavior; their marital separation; his being killed in\r\nWorld War II; their two children; their son, now thirty, was born with\r\ncerebral palsy, is blind and mute, and has been institutionalized since\r\neleven months old; their daughter's husband left her with three children\r\nafter fourteen years of marriage. I silently wondered what old feeling\r\nmight have been aroused in her by her daughter's marital separation. Her\r\ndaughter is so busy that she is unable to write regularly. She has told\r\nMary not to worry if she doesn't hear from her. Mary then expressed\r\nconcern over not receiving her usual letter this week from her mother,\r\nwhom she visits. Mary had tried to reach her by phone and would again. I\r\ninquired if her mother lived alone. Yes, but next to relatives. She then\r\nrelated the drastic physical problems of a relative. I felt the sadness\r\nof this woman as she talked and empathized with the tough time she had\r\nhad.\r\n\r\n\r\n     5. I expressed purposely, to burst asunder negative self\r\n     concepts, my authentic human tender feelings for patients when\r\n     appropriate and acceptable.\r\n\r\n_Example_\r\n\r\nI was sitting in a rather large group of patients in the dayroom. A\r\ncasual conversation ensued about Thanksgiving as it had been and\r\nChristmas as it might be. There was talk of having been at home and\r\nplans for being at home. I supported and encouraged the discussion\r\nbecause of the meaningfulness of holidays, past and present. Snow was\r\ninitiated as a {116} topic. I said, \"It would be nice to have a white\r\nChristmas, but not too white.\" Vincent, a stiff, exact, ritualistic\r\nperson who avoids stepping in an obvious fashion on thresholds, does\r\nlittle jiggle-like dance steps before sitting down, and again before\r\nsettling in his chair, suddenly spoke. \"Josephine, I beg your pardon,\r\nbut I must take issue with you.\" I encouraged his unusual behavioral\r\nexpression. He went on and on about the importance of a white Christmas.\r\nI let my mind flow with his jumbled discourse trying to decipher what he\r\nwas getting at rather than each specific rapidly mentioned issue. He\r\nwent from white to black, day to night, goodness to badness, love to\r\nhate, this side of the world to the other side of the world (Vietnam). I\r\nexpressed that he seemed to keep mentioning two sides of things and that\r\nfor some reason I could not help thinking of boys and girls. I said that\r\nhe was over on that side of the world (room) and that I was over on this\r\nside of the world. I asked why he did not come over to my side, paused a\r\nminute, felt this was asking too much of this patient, and said, \"Well\r\nI'll come over to your side then.\" When I sat down next to Vincent, he\r\ngiggled as he does. Arthur, a younger patient, made a critical jealous\r\ntype comment about Vincent's age (50ish). Arthur has done this before\r\nwhen I give attention to Vincent. Has Arthur a stereotype of father\r\nimages and perhaps mother images? I said to Vincent \"you have beautiful\r\nwhite hair, and big, brown, smiling Italian eyes.\" Vincent sat back\r\nsmiling shyly but comfortably and the discussion of the group continued.\r\n\r\n\r\n     6. I supported patients' rights to loving relationships with\r\n     others: families, other staff, and other patients.\r\n\r\n_Example_\r\n\r\nAlice M. said that she was sad to be back at the hospital after her\r\nweekend at home. Alice is a quiet, bland, soft-spoken person about\r\nfifty. She wears a worried expression even when she smiles and strikes\r\nme like she is \"turned inside\" herself. I encouraged her to talk about\r\nher time at home. She told me about how they had painted the living room\r\nwith what for her was a show of real excitement. I said that her wish to\r\nbe at home was very understandable. I did this because this patient\r\nalmost whispers her wish to be at home and, generally, no one responds\r\nto it. Alice talked on with encouragement about the single sister whom\r\nshe visits and the pleasure it gives her to be with this sister.\r\n\r\n[I have other examples of this nurse behavior that indicate supporting\r\nof relationships between patients and between patients and other\r\npersonnel.]\r\n\r\n\r\n     7. I showed respect for patients as persons with the rights to\r\n     make as many choices for themselves as their current\r\n     capabilities allowed.\r\n\r\n_Example_\r\n\r\nDiscussion of group at coffee revolved around Carolyn's needing a new\r\npair of shoes. The issues were where these might be gotten (Carolyn has\r\n{117} money), what kind she should get, and who and when someone would\r\ntake her for them. It struck me as if Carolyn might not have been\r\npresent. I asked Carolyn what kind of shoes she would like. Carolyn\r\nresponded that she did not know whether she should buy regular shoes, or\r\nsneakers, or canvas shoes like Marilyn had gotten. She beamed. Since,\r\nshe has come up to me several times and discussed the two pairs of\r\ndifferent kinds of shoes she bought and why. Carolyn is a sweet, simple,\r\nretarded, deaf sixty year old whose behavior resembles an eight year\r\nold.\r\n\r\n\r\n     8. I attempted to help patients consider their currently\r\n     expressed feelings and behaviors in light of past life\r\n     experiences and patterns, like and unlike their current ones.\r\n\r\n_Example_\r\n\r\nOn my arrival after Christmas, Irene expressed anger at me in a laughing\r\nway for having been away. Then she moved from a seat in the corner of\r\nthe room to a chair behind me at the coffee table. I moved to allow her\r\nto move up to the table, but she did not. After coffee Irene nonverbally\r\nwith eyes and body movements told me to follow her. She led me into a\r\nsmall beauty parlor room and we both sat down. She closed her eyes. I\r\nsaid, \"You seem to have some feelings about us all having been away.\"\r\nFirst she blurted, \"I missed you,\" then in a quieter voice denied this,\r\n\"It wasn't important that you weren't here.\" I said, \"It could be\r\nhelpful to you to talk about your present missing feelings as you had\r\nsome very important losses of people when you were younger.\" Her eyes\r\nliterally popped open and she again blurted, \"You mean my parents?\" I\r\nsaid, \"Yes and your therapist could help you with this.\" I then asked if\r\nshe ever had the opportunity to talk with anyone about such things. She\r\nreplied, \"No, well I had a social worker when I was a little girl.\" I\r\ntried at this point to transfer feelings of the past to the present.\r\n\"Oh, for how long? What was she like?\" \"I don't remember,\" and Irene\r\nclosed her eyes. In a few minutes Irene requested that I set her hair.\r\nShe is capable of doing this herself. I set her hair, but discussed the\r\nquestion of what she was really asking for. I believe she was asking for\r\nconcrete attention to test my ability to care for her. I was trying to\r\nsay, concretely, by setting her hair, that people could care about her.\r\n\r\n\r\n     9. I encouraged patients' expression to come to understand\r\n     better their behavioral messages to enable me to respond\r\n     overtly as appropriately and therapeutically as possible.\r\n\r\n_Example_\r\n\r\nThe previous time I was at the hospital Alice had not come to the unit.\r\nI was told that she felt too depressed to come down. I went to see her.\r\nShe had looked surprised and impressed by my visit. She talked on at\r\nsome length about her suicidal thoughts. I supported this on the basis\r\nthat {118} verbal expression might make active expression unnecessary\r\nif she experienced empathy regarding how dreadful she felt. Then with\r\nlittle encouragement she had come down to the unit with me. Today, Alice\r\nwas always near me, but nonverbal except for concise responses to\r\nquestions that were offered with effort. I verbalized my reflections on\r\nher behavior and said that I was wondering about it. She said, \"I like\r\nhaving you around; it takes me away from my thoughts.\" \"How are your\r\nthoughts?\" \"The same, I wonder if I'll ever get better?\" \"You've gotten\r\nbetter before. I wonder if you're not more concerned about whether you\r\ncan stay well.\" Alice, eyes watery, agreed with a nod. Irene, another\r\npatient, interrupted, \"Don't expect too much from me, I've been here\r\ntwelve years.\" I responded to them both, \"But, I do expect a lot of you;\r\nthings don't always have to be the same.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     10. I verified my intuitive grasp of how patients were\r\n     experiencing events by questions and comments, and being alert\r\n     to their responses.\r\n\r\n_Example_\r\n\r\nVincent's ritualistic behavior is associated in my mind with his\r\nexaggerated conscious expression of only the true, the good, and the\r\nbeautiful. On this occasion we had just had a long talk about his\r\nweekend at home, his concerns about his family, and his food likes and\r\ndislikes. As we left a room he took his usual long step over the\r\nthreshold. I noted this aloud and asked him if he knew why he did this.\r\nHis expression became wide-eyed and smiling which indicates to me he\r\nconsciously or unconsciously is selecting what he is going to say. We\r\ncame to the next threshold. He stopped me by touching my arm and said,\r\n\"Josephine, I almost grabbed you to prevent your bumping into that\r\npatient.\" In relation to my last question I focused on the \"grabbed you\"\r\nand said, \"Vincent, to think about grabbing me is a pretty natural\r\nthought, and no reason to take a wide step over a threshold.\" He put his\r\nfoot very deliberately if rather testily, right in the middle of this\r\nthreshold. He stopped, looked at me with his hands together and giggled.\r\nThen he had to go to the bathroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n     11. I attempted to encourage hope realistically through\r\n     discussing individual therapeutic gains that could be derived\r\n     from patients' investment in therapeutic opportunities\r\n     available to them.\r\n\r\n_Example_\r\n\r\nMy impression of Arthur, a thirty-two year old, is that he works at\r\nresponding to me agreeably as he thinks I want him to, he frequently\r\ngoes out of his way to make cutting comments to me about middle-aged men\r\npatients, and he responds with anger or teasing to a female patient his\r\nage. Arthur has a mother, father, and two older sisters. He obviously\r\nlet me win at Ping-pong several times. I discussed this with him and\r\nasked if {119} he had ever talked with anyone about his responses to\r\nolder women, people in general, or if he understood them. He said, \"No,\r\nI have not been able to exactly figure this out yet.\" I repeated the\r\ntalking it over. He said, \"I haven't had much chance for that.\" Then\r\nstaring at me he asked seriously, \"Do you think talking it over would\r\nhelp?\" I said, \"I think that it would take a great deal of effort on\r\nyour part, but I believe that it could help.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     12. I supported appropriate patient self-images with as many\r\n     concrete \"hard to denies\" as possible.\r\n\r\n_Example_\r\n\r\nAlice, a middle-aged woman, in the midst of a discussion of the\r\ndifficulties of living outside the hospital, past relationships with\r\nnursing personnel, and her past practical nurse jobs suddenly said, \"I\r\nworry about being sexually OK.\" This was kind of blurted out and she\r\nobserved me closely. I said, \"I thought that you had some concerns about\r\nthis in relation to how you responded to my cutting the hairs on your\r\nface. I guess everyone worries at times about their adequacy in this\r\narea.\" She said, \"I've never been able to have intercourse; I can just\r\ngo as far as heavy petting. People say you can get a lot expressed if\r\nyou have intercourse.\" I said, \"Some people can, but if you have other\r\nstandards that you've grown up with, (I suspect a rather religious,\r\nrigid Jewish background) it might cause difficulties to go against those\r\nstandards.\" (Alice first became ill at sixteen, left school, and had\r\nsome treatment in the community.) \"It's pretty responsible not to be\r\nwilling to bring a fatherless baby into the world, and I'm sure you'd\r\nhave feelings about how your family might have responded to this sort of\r\nthing.\" Alice nodded and said \"It's just that I don't know how womanly I\r\nam.\" I said with gestures and emphatically, \"Well, Alice, if you have\r\ntwo things up here and no thing down here, then the fact is that you are\r\na woman.\" Discussion pursued about her further talking about this topic\r\nwith her therapist and the value of her working through her feelings in\r\nthis area. This was a lengthy discussion and the first talking I had\r\nexperienced Alice doing since her depression. {120} {121}\r\n\r\n GLOSSARY\r\n\r\n\r\n~angular view.~ An individual's unique vision of reality necessarily\r\nrestricted by the angle of his particular here and now.\r\n\r\n~authenticity.~ Genuineness; congruence with the self.\r\n\r\n~(the) between.~ The realm of the intersubjective.\r\n\r\n~bracket.~ Hold in abeyance.\r\n\r\n~community.~ Two or more persons struggling together toward a center.\r\n\r\n~existential.~ Of, relating to, or affirming existence; grounded in\r\nexistence or the experience of living.\r\n\r\n~existential dialogue.~ A unique individual person with the wholeness of\r\nhis being is present, open to, and relates to the other seen in his\r\nunique individual wholeness; an exchange in which two persons transcend\r\nthemselves and participate in the other's being; an interior\r\nunification; a mutual common union in being.\r\n\r\n~existential experience.~ Contact with reality with the whole of one's\r\nbeing; involves all that a man _is_ as opposed to experiencing through\r\none or several faculties.\r\n\r\n~existentialism.~ Philosophy based on phenomenological studies of\r\nreality; centers on the analysis of existence particularly of the\r\nindividual human being, stresses the freedom and responsibility of the\r\nindividual, regards human existence as not completely describable or\r\nunderstandable in idealistic or scientific terms.\r\n\r\n~here and now.~ An individual's unique experience of his present spatial\r\nand temporal reality including his past experiences and expectations of\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n~humanistic nursing.~ A theory and practice that rest on an existential\r\nphilosophy, value experiencing and the evolving of the \"new,\" and aim at\r\nphenomenological description of the art-science of nursing viewed as a\r\nlived intersubjective transactional experience; nursing seen within its\r\nhuman context.\r\n\r\n~intersubjective.~ Pertaining to two or more human persons and their\r\nshared between; a relationship of two or more human beings in which each\r\nis the originator of human acts and responses. {122}\r\n\r\n~lived dialogue.~ A form of existential intersubjective relating\r\nexpressed in being with and doing with the other who is regarded as a\r\npresence (as opposed to an object); a lived call and response.\r\n\r\n~lived world.~ The everyday world as it is experienced in the here and\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n~metanursing.~ A discipline designed to deal critically with nursing,\r\nontological study of nursing; study of the phenomenon of nursing; a\r\ncritical study of nursing within its human context.\r\n\r\n~metatheoretical.~ Transcending theory; ontological inquiry from which\r\ntheory may be derived.\r\n\r\n~nursology.~ Study of the phenomenon of nursing aimed toward the\r\ndevelopment of nursing theory.\r\n\r\n~phenomenology.~ The descriptive study of phenomena.\r\n\r\n~phenomenon.~ An observable fact, event, occurrence or circumstance; an\r\nappearance or immediate object of awareness in experience.
