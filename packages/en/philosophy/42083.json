They drew, perhaps, the most touching scene in Middle-age\r\nliterary history,--the just man in prison, awaiting death, consoled by\r\nthe Philosophy that had been his light in life, and handing down to\r\nposterity for their comfort and strength the presence of her whose\r\nsilver rays had been his guide as well under the stars of Fortune as the\r\nmirk of Fate. With Milton in his dark days, Boece in prison could say,--\r\n\r\n                                  ‘I argue not\r\n  Against Heaven’s hand or will, nor bate a jot\r\n  Of heart or hope; but still bear up and steer\r\n  Right onward. What supports me, dost thou ask?\r\n  The conscience, friend, to have lost them overplied\r\n  In liberty’s defence, my noble task,\r\n  Of which all Europe rings from side to side.’\r\n\r\nFor, indeed, the echoes of Boethius, Boethius, rang out loud from every\r\ncorner of European Literature. An Alfred awoke them in England, a\r\nChaucer, a Caxton would not let them die; an Elizabeth revived them\r\namong the glorious music of her reign.[I-1] To us, though far off, they\r\ncome with a sweet sound. ‘The angelic’ Thomas Aquinas commented on him,\r\nand many others followed the saint’s steps. Dante read him, though,\r\nstrange to say, he speaks of the Consolation as ‘a book not known by\r\nmany.’[I-2] Belgium had her translations--both Flemish[I-3] and\r\nFrench[I-4]; Germany hers,[I-5] France hers,[I-6] Italy hers.[I-7] The\r\nLatin editors are too numerous to be catalogued here, and manuscripts\r\nabound in all our great libraries.\r\n\r\nNo philosopher was so bone of the bone and flesh of the flesh of\r\nMiddle-age writers as Boethius. Take up what writer you will, and you\r\nfind not only the sentiments, but the very words of the distinguished\r\nold Roman. And surely we who read him in Chaucer’s tongue, will not\r\nrefuse to say that his full-circling meed of glory was other than\r\ndeserved. Nor can we marvel that at the end of our great poet’s life, he\r\nwas glad that he had swelled the chorus of Boethius’ praise; and ‘of the\r\ntranslacioun of Boece de Consolacioun,’ thanked ‘oure Lord Ihesu Crist\r\nand his moder, and alle the seintes in heuen.’\r\n\r\nThe impression made by Boethius on Chaucer was evidently very deep. Not\r\nonly did he translate him directly, as in the present work, but he read\r\nhis beloved original over and over again, as witness the following list,\r\nincomplete of course, of passages from Chaucer’s poems translated more\r\nor less literally from the _De Consolatione_:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-1: Other translations are by John Walton of Osney, in\r\n    verse, in 1410 (Reg.

MS. reads _not nat_, to the confusion of\r\n    the metre.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-9: = ne wot nat = knows not.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE CHAIN OF LOVE.\r\n\r\n  The firste moevere of the cause above,\r\n  Whan he first made the fayre cheyne of love,\r\n  Gret was theffect, and heigh was his entente;\r\n  Wel wist he why, and what therof he mente;\r\n  _For with that faire cheyne of love he bond\r\n  The fyr, the watir, the eyr, and eek the lond\r\n  In certeyn boundes, that they may not flee._\r\n\r\n    (_Knightes Tale_, p. 92.)\r\n\r\n  That þe world with stable feith / varieth acordable chaungynges //\r\n  þat the contraryos qualite of elementȝ holden amonge hem self\r\n  aliaunce perdurable / þat phebus the sonne with his goldene\r\n  chariet / bryngeth forth the rosene day / þat the mone hath\r\n  commaundement ouer the nyhtes // whiche nyhtes hesperus the eue\r\n  sterre hat[h] browt // þat þe se gredy to flowen constreyneth with\r\n  a certeyn ende hise floodes / so þat it is nat l[e]ueful to\r\n  strechche hise brode termes or bowndes vp-on the erthes // þat is\r\n  to seyn to couere alle the erthe // Al this a-cordaunce of thinges\r\n  is bownden with looue / þat gouerneth erthe and see / and [he]\r\n  hath also commaundementȝ to the heuenes / and yif this looue\r\n  slakede the brydelis / alle thinges þat now louen hem to-gederes /\r\n  wolden maken a batayle contynuely and stryuen to fordoon the\r\n  fasoun of this worlde / the which they now leden in acordable\r\n  feith by fayre moeuynges // this looue halt to-gideres poeples /\r\n  ioygned with an hooly bond / and knytteth sacrement of maryages of\r\n  chaste looues // And loue enditeth lawes to trewe felawes // O\r\n  weleful weere mankynde / yif thilke loue þat gouerneth heuene\r\n  gouerned yowre corages /.\r\n\r\n    (_Chaucer’s Boethius_, bk. ii. met. 8.)\r\n\r\n  Quod mundus stabili fide\r\n  Concordes variat vices,\r\n  Quod pugnantia semina\r\n  Fœdus perpetuum tenent,\r\n  Quod Phœbus roseum diem\r\n  Curru provehit aureo,\r\n  Ut quas duxerit Hesperus\r\n  Phœbe noctibus imperet,\r\n  Ut fluctus avidum mare\r\n  Certo fine coerceat,\r\n  Ne terris liceat vagis\r\n  Latos tundere terminos;\r\n  _Hanc rerum seriem ligat,\r\n  Terras ac pelagus regens,\r\n  Et cœlo imperitans amor._\r\n  Hic si fræna remiserit,\r\n  Quicquid nunc amat invicem,\r\n  Bellum continuo geret:\r\n  Et quam nunc socia fide\r\n  Pulcris motibus incitant,\r\n  Certent solvere machinam.\r\n  Hic sancto populos quoque\r\n  Junctos fœdere continet,\r\n  Hic et conjugii sacrum\r\n  Castis nectit amoribus,\r\n  Hic fidis etiam sua\r\n  Dictat jura sodalibus.\r\n  O felix hominum genus,\r\n  Si vestros animos amor,\r\n  Quo cælum regitur, regat.\r\n\r\n    (_Boeth._, lib. ii. met. 8.)\r\n\r\n  Love, that of erth and se hath governaunce!\r\n  Love, that his hestes hath in hevene hye!\r\n  Love, that with an holsom alliaunce\r\n  Halt peples joyned, as hym liste hem gye!\r\n  Love, that knetteth law and compaignye,\r\n  And couples doth in vertu for to dwelle!\r\n\r\n    (_Troylus & Cryseyde_, st. 243, vol. iv. p. 296.)\r\n\r\n  That, that the world with faith, which that is stable\r\n  Dyverseth so, his stoundes concordynge;--\r\n  That elementz, that ben so discordable,\r\n  Holden a bond, perpetualy durynge;--\r\n  That Phebus mot his rosy carte forth brynge,\r\n  And that the mone hath lordschip overe the nyghte;--\r\n  Al this doth Love, ay heryed be his myght!\r\n\r\n  That, that the se, that gredy is to flowen,\r\n  Constreyneth to a certeyn ende so\r\n  Hise flodes, that so fiersly they ne growen\r\n  To drenchen erth and alle for everemo;\r\n  And if that Love aught lete his brydel go,\r\n  Al that now loveth asonder sholde lepe,\r\n  And lost were al that Love halt now to kepe.\r\n\r\n    (_Ibid._ st. 244, 245.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. MUTABILITY DIRECTED AND LIMITED BY AN IMMUTABLE AND DIVINE\r\nINTELLIGENCE.\r\n\r\n  That same prynce and moevere eek, quod he,\r\n  Hath stabled, in this wrecched world adoun,\r\n  Certeyn dayes and duracioun\r\n  To alle that er engendrid in this place,\r\n  Over the whiche day they may nat pace,\r\n  Al mowe they yit wel here dayes abregge;\r\n  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\r\n  Than may men wel by this ordre discerne\r\n  That thilke moevere stabul is and eterne.\r\n  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\r\n  And therfore of his wyse purveaunce\r\n  He hath so wel biset his ordenaunce,\r\n  That spices of thinges and progressiouns\r\n  Schullen endure by successiouns\r\n  And nat eterne be, withoute any lye.\r\n\r\n    (_Knightes Tale_, vol. ii. p. 92, 93.)\r\n\r\n  Þe engendrynge of alle þinges quod she and alle þe progressiouns\r\n  of muuable nature. and alle þat moeueþ in any manere takiþ hys\r\n  causes. hys ordre. and hys formes. of þe stablenesse of þe deuyne\r\n  þouȝt [and thilke deuyne thowht] þat is yset and put in þe toure.\r\n  þat is to seyne in þe heyȝt of þe simplicite of god. stablisiþ\r\n  many manere gyses to þinges þat ben to don.\r\n\r\n    (_Chaucer’s Boethius_, bk. iv. pr. 6, p. 134.)\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE PART IS DERIVED FROM THE WHOLE, THE IMPERFECT FROM THE PERFECT.\r\n\r\n  Wel may men knowe, but it be a fool,\r\n  That every partye dyryveth from his hool.\r\n  For nature hath nat take his bygynnyng\r\n  Of no partye ne cantel of a thing,\r\n  But of a thing that parfyt is and stable,\r\n  Descendyng so, til it be corumpable.\r\n\r\n    (_Knightes Tale_, vol. ii. p. 92.)\r\n\r\n  For al þing þat is cleped inperfit . is proued inperfit by þe\r\n  amenusynge of perfeccioun . or of þing þat is perfit . and her-of\r\n  comeþ it . þat in euery þing general . yif þat . þat men seen any\r\n  þing þat is inperfit . certys in þilke general þer mot ben somme\r\n  þing þat is perfit. For yif so be þat perfeccioun is don awey .\r\n  men may nat þinke nor seye fro whennes þilke þing is þat is cleped\r\n  inperfit . For þe nature of þinges ne token nat her bygynnyng of\r\n  þinges amenused and inperfit . but it procediþ of þingus þat ben\r\n  al hool . and absolut . and descendeþ so doune in-to outerest\r\n  þinges and in-to þingus empty and wiþ-oute fruyt . but as I haue\r\n  shewed a litel her byforne . þat yif þer be a blisfulnesse þat be\r\n  frele and vein and inperfit . þer may no man doute . þat þer nys\r\n  som blisfulnesse þat is sad stedfast and perfit.’\r\n\r\n    (bk. iii. pr. 10, p. 89.)\r\n\r\n  Omne enim quod imperfectum esse dicitur, id deminutione perfecti\r\n  imperfectum esse perhibetur. Quo fit ut si in quolibet genere\r\n  imperfectum quid esse videatur, in eo perfectum quoque aliquod\r\n  esse necesse sit. Etenim perfectione sublata, unde illud, quod\r\n  imperfectum perhibetur, extiterit, ne fingi quidem potest. _Neque\r\n  enim ab diminutis inconsummatisque natura rerum cepit exordium,\r\n  sed ab integris absolutisque procedens in hæc extrema atque effœta\r\n  dilabitur._ Quod si, uti paulo ante monstravimus, est quædam boni\r\n  fragilis imperfecta felicitas, esse aliquam solidam perfectamque\r\n  non potest dubitari.\r\n\r\n    (_Boeth._, lib. iii. pr. 10.)\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. GENTILITY.\r\n\r\n  For gentilnesse nys but renomé\r\n  Of thin auncestres, for her heigh bounté\r\n  Which is a straunge thing to thy persone.\r\n\r\n    (_The Wyf of Bathes Tale_, vol. ii. p. 241.)\r\n\r\n  For if þe name of gentilesse be referred to renoun and clernesse\r\n  of linage. þan is gentil name but a foreine þing.\r\n\r\n    (_Chaucer’s Boethius_, p. 78.)\r\n\r\n  _Quæ_ [nobilitas], _si ad claritudinem refertur, aliena est._\r\n\r\n    (_Boethius_, lib. iii. pr. 6.)\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. NERO’S CRUELTY.\r\n\r\n  No teer out of his eyen for that sighte\r\n  Ne cam; but sayde, a fair womman was sche.\r\n  Gret wonder is how that he couthe or mighte\r\n  Be domesman on hir dede beauté.\r\n\r\n    (_The Monkes Tale_, vol. iii. p. 217.)\r\n\r\n  Ne no tere ne wette his face, but he was so hard-herted þat he\r\n  myȝte ben domesman or iuge of hire dede beauté.\r\n\r\n    (_Chaucer’s Boethius_, p. 55.)\r\n\r\n  Ora non tinxit lacrymis, sed esse\r\n  Censor extincti potuit decoris.\r\n\r\n    (_Boethius_, lib. ii. met. 6.)\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. PREDESTINATION AND FREE-WILL.\r\n\r\nIn ‘Troylus and Cryseyde’ we find the following long passage taken from\r\nBoethius, book v. prose 2, 3.\r\n\r\nBook iv. st. 134, vol. iv. p. 339.\r\n\r\n  (1) Syn God seth every thynge, out of doutaunce,\r\n      And hem disponeth, thorugh his ordinaunce,\r\n      In hire merites sothely for to be,\r\n      As they shul comen by predesteyné\r\n\r\n136\r\n\r\n  (2) For som men seyn if God seth al byforne,\r\n      Ne God may not deseyved ben pardé!\r\n      Than moot it fallen, theigh men hadde it sworne,\r\n      That purveyaunce hath seyn befor to be,\r\n      Wherfor I seye, that, from eterne, if he\r\n      Hathe wiste byforn our thought ek as oure dede,\r\n      We have no fre choys, as thise clerkes rede.\r\n\r\n137\r\n\r\n  (3) For other thoughte, nor other dede also,\r\n      Myghte nevere ben, but swich as purveyaunce,\r\n      Which may nat ben deceyved nevere moo,\r\n      Hath feled byforne, withouten ignoraunce;\r\n      For if ther myghte ben a variaunce,\r\n      To wrythen out fro Goddes purveyinge,\r\n      Ther nere no prescience of thynge comynge;\r\n\r\n138\r\n\r\n  (4) But it were rather an opinyon\r\n      Uncertein, and no stedfast forseynge;\r\n      And certes that were an abusyon\r\n      That God shold han no parfit clere wetynge,\r\n      More than we men, that han douteous wenynge,\r\n      But swich an erroure upon God to gesse\r\n      Were fals, and foule, and wikked corsednesse.\r\n\r\n139\r\n\r\n  (5) They seyn right thus, that thynge is nat to come,\r\n      For that the prescience hath seyne byfore\r\n      That it shal come; but they seyn that therfore\r\n      That it shal come, therfor the purveyaunce\r\n      Woot it bifore, withouten ignorance.\r\n\r\n140\r\n\r\n  (6) And in this manere this necessité\r\n      Retourneth in his part contrarye agayn;\r\n      For nedfully byhoveth it not to be,\r\n      That thilke thynges fallen in certeyn\r\n      That ben purveyed; but nedly, as they seyne,\r\n      Bihoveth it that thynges, which that falle,\r\n      That thei in certein ben purveied alle.\r\n\r\n141\r\n\r\n  (7) I mene as though I labourede me in this,\r\n      To enqueren which thynge cause of whiche thynge be;\r\n\r\n  (8) As, whether that the prescience of God is\r\n      The certein cause of the necessité\r\n      Of thynges that to comen ben, pardé!\r\n      Or, if necessité of thynge comynge\r\n      Be cause certein of the purveyinge.\r\n\r\n142\r\n\r\n  (9) But now nenforce I me nat in shewynge\r\n      How the ordre of causes stant;

See _Chaucer’s\r\nBoethius_, p. 110, 111.\r\n\r\nÆtas Prima is of course a metrical version of lib. ii. met. 5.\r\n\r\nHampole speaks of the wonderful sight of the Lynx; perhaps he was\r\nindebted to Boethius for the hint. --(See _Boethius_, book 3, pr. 8,\r\np. 81.)\r\n\r\nI have seen the following elsewhere:\r\n\r\n  (1) Value not beauty, for it may be destroyed by a three days’\r\n  fever.\r\n\r\n    (See _Chaucer’s Boethius_, p. 81.)\r\n\r\n  (2) There is no greater plague than the enmity of thy familiar\r\n  friend.\r\n\r\n    (See _Chaucer’s_ translation, p. 77.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChaucer did not English Boethius second-hand, through any early French\r\nversion, as some have supposed, but made his translation with the Latin\r\noriginal before him.\r\n\r\nJean de Méung’s version, the only early French translation, perhaps,\r\naccessible to Chaucer, is not always literal, while the present\r\ntranslation is seldom free or periphrastic, but conforms closely to the\r\nLatin, and is at times awkwardly literal. A few passages, taken\r\nhaphazard, will make this sufficiently clear.\r\n\r\n  _Et dolor ætatem jussit inesse suam._ And sorou haþ comaunded his\r\n  age to be in me (p. 4).\r\n\r\n  Et ma douleur {com}ma{n}da a vieillesse\r\n  Entrer en moy / ains quen fust hors ieunesse.\r\n\r\n  _Mors hominum felix, quæ se nec dulcibus annis\r\n  Inserit, et mæstis sæpe vocata venit._\r\n\r\n  Þilke deeþ of men is welful þat ne comeþ not in ȝeres þat ben\r\n  swete (i. _mirie_). but comeþ to wrecches often yclepid.

Many terms make their appearance in English for\r\nthe first time,--and most of them have become naturalized, and are such\r\nas we could ill spare. Some few are rather uncommon, as _gouernaile_\r\n(gubernaculum), p. 27; _arbitre_ (arbitrium), p. 154. As Chaucer takes\r\nthe trouble to explain _inestimable_ (inæstimabilis), p. 158, it could\r\nnot have been a very familiar term.\r\n\r\nOur translator evidently took note of various readings, for on p. 31 he\r\nnotes a variation of the original. On p. 51 he uses _armurers_\r\n(= armures) to render _arma_, though most copies agree in reading\r\n_arva_.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous glosses and explanations of particular passages,\r\nwhich seem to be interpolated by Chaucer himself. Thus he explains what\r\nis meant by the _heritage of Socrates_ (p. 10, 11); he gives the\r\nmeaning of _coemption_ (p. 15); of _Euripus_ (p. 33); of the _porch_\r\n(p. 166).[I-11] Some of his definitions are very quaint; as, for\r\ninstance, that of Tragedy--‘_a dité of a prosperité for a tyme þat endiþ\r\nin wrechednesse_’ (p. 35). One would think that the following definition\r\nof Tragedian would be rather superfluous after this,--‘_a maker of dites\r\nþat hyȝten_ (are called) _tregedies_’ (p. 77).\r\n\r\n  _Melliflui . . . oris Homerus_\r\n\r\nis thus quaintly Englished: _Homer wiþ þe hony mouþe, þat is to seyn.\r\nhomer wiþ þe swete dites_ (p. 153).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe present translation of the _De Consolatione_ is taken from\r\nAdditional MS. 10,340, which is supposed to be the _oldest_ manuscript\r\nthat exists in our public libraries. After it was all copied out and\r\nready for press, Mr Bradshaw was kind enough to procure me, for the\r\npurpose of collation, the loan of the Camb. University MS. Ii. 3. 21,\r\nfrom which the various readings at the foot of the pages are taken.\r\n\r\nHad I had an opportunity of examining the Cambridge MS. carefully\r\nthroughout before the work was so far advanced, I should certainly have\r\nselected it in preference to the text now given to the reader. Though\r\nnot so ancient as the British Museum MS., it is far more correct in its\r\ngrammatical inflexions, and is no doubt a copy of an older and very\r\naccurate text.\r\n\r\nThe Additional MS. is written by a scribe who was unacquainted with the\r\nforce of the final _-e_. Thus he adds it to the preterites of strong\r\nverbs, which do not require it; he omits it in the preterites of weak\r\nverbs where it is wanted, and attaches it to passive participles (of\r\nweak verbs), where it is superfluous. The scribe of the Cambridge MS. is\r\ncareful to preserve the final _-e_ where it is a sign (1) of the\r\ndefinite declension of the adjective; (2) of the plural adjective;\r\n(3) of the infinitive mood; (4) of the preterite of weak verbs; (5) of\r\npresent participles;[I-12] (6) of the 2nd pers. pret. indic. of strong\r\nverbs; (7) of adverbs; (8) of an older vowel ending.\r\n\r\nThe Addit. MS. has frequently _thilk_ (singular and plural), and _-nes_\r\n(in _wrechednes_, &c.), when the Camb.

It is well known that after\r\nfilling the dignities of Consul and Senator in the court of Theodoric,\r\nhe fell a victim to the jealousy of a sovereign, from whose memory, in\r\nmany respects glorious, the stain of that blood has never been effaced.\r\nThe _Consolation of Philosophy_, the chief work of Boethius, was written\r\nin his prison. Few books are more striking from the circumstances of\r\ntheir production. Last of the classic writers, in style not impure,\r\nthough displaying too lavishly that poetic exuberance which had\r\ndistinguished the two or three preceding centuries, in elevation of\r\nsentiment equal to any of the philosophers, and mingling a Christian\r\nsanctity with their lessons, he speaks from his prison in the swan-like\r\ntones of dying eloquence. The philosophy that consoled him in bonds, was\r\nsoon required in the sufferings of a cruel death. Quenched in his blood,\r\nthe lamp he had trimmed with a skilful hand gave no more light; the\r\nlanguage of Tully and Virgil soon ceased to be spoken; and many ages\r\nwere to pass away, before learned diligence restored its purity, and the\r\nunion of genius with imitation taught a few modern writers to surpass in\r\neloquence the Latinity of Boethius. --(Hallam’s _Literature of Europe_,\r\ni. 2, 4th ed. 1854.)\r\n\r\nThe Senator Boethius is the last of the Romans whom Cato or Tully could\r\nhave acknowledged for their countryman. As a wealthy orphan, he\r\ninherited the patrimony and honours of the Anician family, a name\r\nambitiously assumed by the kings and emperors of the age; and the\r\nappellation of Manlius asserted his genuine or fabulous descent from a\r\nrace of consuls and dictators, who had repulsed the Gauls from the\r\nCapitol, and sacrificed their sons to the discipline of the Republic. In\r\nthe youth of Boethius the studies of Rome were not totally abandoned; a\r\nVirgil is now extant, corrected by the hand of a consul; and the\r\nprofessors of grammar, rhetoric, and jurisprudence, were maintained in\r\ntheir privileges and pensions by the liberality of the Goths. But the\r\nerudition of the Latin language was insufficient to satiate his ardent\r\ncuriosity; and Boethius is said to have employed eighteen laborious\r\nyears in the schools of Athens, which were supported by the zeal, the\r\nlearning, and the diligence of Proclus and his disciples. The reason and\r\npiety of their Roman pupil were fortunately saved from the contagion of\r\nmystery and magic, which polluted the groves of the Academy, but he\r\nimbibed the spirit, and imitated the method, of his dead and living\r\nmasters, who attempted to reconcile the strong and subtle sense of\r\nAristotle with the devout contemplation and sublime fancy of Plato.\r\nAfter his return to Rome, and his marriage with the daughter of his\r\nfriend, the patrician Symmachus, Boethius still continued, in a palace\r\nof ivory and [glass] to prosecute the same studies. The Church was\r\nedified by his profound defence of the orthodox creed against the Arian,\r\nthe Eutychian, and the Nestorian heresies; and the Catholic unity was\r\nexplained or exposed in a formal treatise by the _indifference_ of three\r\ndistinct though consubstantial persons. For the benefit of his Latin\r\nreaders, his genius submitted to teach the first elements of the arts\r\nand sciences of Greece. The geometry of Euclid, the music of Pythagoras,\r\nthe arithmetic of Nicomachus, the mechanics of Archimedes, the astronomy\r\nof Ptolemy, the theology of Plato, and the logic of Aristotle, with the\r\ncommentary of Porphyry, were translated and illustrated by the\r\nindefatigable pen of the Roman senator. And he alone was esteemed\r\ncapable of describing the wonders of art, a sun-dial, a water-clock, or\r\na sphere which represented the motions of the planets. From these\r\nabstruse speculations, Boethius stooped, or, to speak more truly, he\r\nrose to the social duties of public and private life: the indigent were\r\nrelieved by his liberality; and his eloquence, which flattery might\r\ncompare to the voice of Demosthenes or Cicero, was uniformly exerted in\r\nthe cause of innocence and humanity. Such conspicuous merit was felt and\r\nrewarded by a discerning prince: the dignity of Boethius was adorned\r\nwith the titles of consul and patrician, and his talents were usefully\r\nemployed in the important station of master of the offices.\r\nNotwithstanding the equal claims of the East and West, his two sons were\r\ncreated, in their tender youth, the consuls of the same year. On the\r\nmemorable day of their inauguration, they proceeded in solemn pomp from\r\ntheir palace to the forum amidst the applause of the senate and people;\r\nand their joyful father, the true Consul of Rome, after pronouncing an\r\noration in the praise of his royal benefactor, distributed a triumphal\r\nlargess in the games of the circus. Prosperous in his fame and fortunes,\r\nin his public honours and private alliances, in the cultivation of\r\nscience and the consciousness of virtue, Boethius might have been styled\r\nhappy, if that precarious epithet could be safely applied before the\r\nlast term of the life of man.\r\n\r\nA philosopher, liberal of his wealth and parsimonious of his time, might\r\nbe insensible to the common allurements of ambition, the thirst of gold\r\nand employment. And some credit may be due to the asseveration of\r\nBoethius, that he had reluctantly obeyed the divine Plato, who enjoins\r\nevery virtuous citizen to rescue the state from the usurpation of vice\r\nand ignorance. For the integrity of his public conduct he appeals to the\r\nmemory of his country. His authority had restrained the pride and\r\noppression of the royal officers, and his eloquence had delivered\r\nPaulianus from the dogs of the palace. He had always pitied, and often\r\nrelieved, the distress of the provincials, whose fortunes were exhausted\r\nby public and private rapine; and Boethius alone had courage to oppose\r\nthe tyranny of the Barbarians, elated by conquest, excited by avarice,\r\nand, as he complains, encouraged by impunity. In these honourable\r\ncontests his spirit soared above the consideration of danger, and\r\nperhaps of prudence; and we may learn from the example of Cato, that a\r\ncharacter of pure and inflexible virtue is the most apt to be misled by\r\nprejudice, to be heated by enthusiasm, and to confound private enmities\r\nwith public justice. The disciple of Plato might exaggerate the\r\ninfirmities of nature, and the imperfections of society; and the mildest\r\nform of a Gothic kingdom, even the weight of allegiance and gratitude,\r\nmust be insupportable to the free spirit of a Roman patriot. But the\r\nfavour and fidelity of Boethius declined in just proportion with the\r\npublic happiness; and an unworthy colleague was imposed to divide and\r\ncontrol the power of the master of the offices. In the last gloomy\r\nseason of Theodoric, he indignantly felt that he was a slave; but as his\r\nmaster had only power over his life, he stood without arms and without\r\nfear against the face of an angry Barbarian, who had been provoked to\r\nbelieve that the safety of the senate was incompatible with his own. The\r\nSenator Albinus was accused and already convicted on the presumption of\r\n_hoping_, as it was said, the liberty of Rome.\r\n\r\n“If Albinus be criminal,” exclaimed the orator, “the senate and myself\r\nare all guilty of the same crime. If we are innocent, Albinus is equally\r\nentitled to the protection of the laws.” These laws might not have\r\npunished the simple and barren wish of an unattainable blessing; but\r\nthey would have shown less indulgence to the rash confession of\r\nBoethius, that, had he known of a conspiracy, the tyrant never should.\r\nThe advocate of Albinus was soon involved in the danger and perhaps the\r\nguilt of his client; their signature (which they denied as a forgery)\r\nwas affixed to the original address, inviting the emperor to deliver\r\nItaly from the Goths; and three witnesses of honourable rank, perhaps of\r\ninfamous reputation, attested the treasonable designs of the Roman\r\npatrician. Yet his innocence must be presumed, since he was deprived by\r\nTheodoric of the means of justification, and rigorously confined in the\r\ntower of Pavia, while the senate, at the distance of five hundred miles,\r\npronounced a sentence of confiscation and death against the most\r\nillustrious of its members. At the command of the Barbarians, the occult\r\nscience of a philosopher was stigmatized with the names of sacrilege and\r\nmagic. A devout and dutiful attachment to the senate was condemned as\r\ncriminal by the trembling voices of the senators themselves; and their\r\ningratitude deserved the wish or prediction of Boethius, that, after\r\nhim, none should be found guilty of the same offence.\r\n\r\nWhile Boethius, oppressed with fetters, expected each moment the\r\nsentence or the stroke of death, he composed in the tower of Pavia the\r\n_Consolation of Philosophy_; a golden volume not unworthy of the leisure\r\nof Plato or Tully, but which claims incomparable merit from the\r\nbarbarism of the times and the situation of the author. The celestial\r\nguide, whom he had so long invoked at Rome and Athens, now condescended\r\nto illumine his dungeon, to revive his courage, and to pour into his\r\nwounds her salutary balm. She taught him to compare his long prosperity\r\nand his recent distress, and to conceive new hopes from the inconstancy\r\nof fortune. Reason had informed him of the precarious condition of her\r\ngifts; experience had satisfied him of their real value; he had enjoyed\r\nthem without guilt; he might resign them without a sigh, and calmly\r\ndisdain the impotent malice of his enemies, who had left him happiness,\r\nsince they had left him virtue. From the earth, Boethius ascended to\r\nheaven in search of the SUPREME GOOD; explored the metaphysical\r\nlabyrinth of chance and destiny, of prescience and free-will, of time\r\nand eternity; and generously attempted to reconcile the perfect\r\nattributes of the Deity with the apparent disorders of his moral and\r\nphysical government. Such topics of consolation, so obvious, so vague,\r\nor so abstruse, are ineffectual to subdue the feelings of human nature.\r\nYet the sense of misfortune may be diverted by the labour of thought;\r\nand the sage who could artfully combine in the same work the various\r\nriches of philosophy, poetry, and eloquence, must already have possessed\r\nthe intrepid calmness which he affected to seek. Suspense, the worst of\r\nevils, was at length determined by the ministers of death, who executed,\r\nand perhaps exceeded, the inhuman mandate of Theodoric. A strong cord\r\nwas fastened round the head of Boethius, and forcibly tightened till his\r\neyes almost started from their sockets; and some mercy may be discovered\r\nin the milder torture of beating him with clubs till he expired. But his\r\ngenius survived to diffuse a ray of knowledge over the darkest ages of\r\nthe Latin world; the writings of the philosopher were translated by the\r\nmost glorious of the English kings, and the third emperor of the name of\r\nOtho removed to a more honourable tomb the bones of a Catholic saint,\r\nwho, from his Arian persecutors, had acquired the honours of martyrdom\r\nand the fame of miracles. In the last hours of Boethius, he derived some\r\ncomfort from the safety of his two sons, of his wife, and of his\r\nfather-in-law, the venerable Symmachus. But the grief of Symmachus was\r\nindiscreet, and perhaps disrespectful; he had presumed to lament, he\r\nmight dare to revenge, the death of an injured friend. He was dragged in\r\nchains from Rome to the palace of Ravenna; and the suspicions of\r\nTheodoric could only be appeased by the blood of an innocent and aged\r\nsenator.--Gibbon’s _Decline and Fall_, 1838, vol. vii. p. 45-52 (without\r\nthe notes).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n_(Giving the first line of each Metre, the first words of each Prose,\r\nand the corresponding page of the translation)._\r\n\r\nBook  Metre  Prose                                              Page\r\n\r\n  I     1     --    Carmina qui quondam studio florente peregi     4\r\n  „    --      1    Hæc dum mecum tacitus ipse reputarem           5\r\n  „     2     --    Heu, quam præcipiti mersa profundo             7\r\n  „    --      2    Sed medicinæ, inquit, potius tempus est        8\r\n  „     3     --    Tunc me discussa liquerunt nocte tenebræ       9\r\n  „    --      3    Haud aliter tristitiæ nebulis dissolutis,\r\n                      hausi cœlum                                 10\r\n  „     4     --    Quisquis composito serenus ævo                12\r\n  „    --      4    Sentisne, inquit, hæc, atque animo\r\n                      illabuntur tuo?                             13\r\n  „     5     --    O stelliferi conditor orbis                   21\r\n  „    --      5    Hæc ubi continuato dolore delatravi           23\r\n  „     6     --    Cum Phœbi radiis grave                        25\r\n  „    --      6    Primum igitur paterisne me pauculis\r\n                      rogationibus                                26\r\n  „     7     --    Nubibus atris                                 29\r\n II    --      1    Posthæc paulisper obticuit                    29\r\n  „     1     --    Hæc cum superba verterit vices dextra         33\r\n  „    --      2    Vellem autem pauca tecum fortunæ ipsius       33\r\n  „     2     --    Si quantas rapidis flatibus incitus           35\r\n  „    --      3    His igitur si pro se tecum fortuna\r\n                      loqueretur                                  36\r\n  „     3     --    Cum polo Phœbus roseis quadrigis              39\r\n  „    --      4    Tum ego, Vera, inquam, commemoras             39\r\n  „     4     --    Quisquis volet perennem                       44\r\n  „    --      5    Sed quoniam rationum jam in te mearum\r\n                      fomenta                                     45\r\n  „     5     --    Felix nimium prior ætas                       50\r\n  „    --      6    Quid autem de dignitatibus, potentiaque\r\n                      disseram                                    51\r\n  „     6     --    Novimus quantas dederit ruinas                55\r\n  „    --      7    Tum ego, Scis, inquam, ipsa                   56\r\n  „     7     --    Quicumque solam mente præcipiti petit         60\r\n  „    --      8    Sed ne me inexorabile contra fortunam         61\r\n  „     8     --    Quod mundus stabili fide                      62\r\n III    --     1    Jam cantum illa finierat                      63\r\n  „     1     --    Qui serere ingenuum volet agrum               64\r\n  „    --      2    Tum defixo paululum visu                      64\r\n  „     2     --    Quantas rerum flectat habenas                 68\r\n  „    --      3    Vos quoque, o terrena animalia                69\r\n  „     3     --    Quamvis fluente dives auri gurgite            71\r\n  „    --      4    Sed dignitates honorabilem reverendumque      72\r\n  „     4     --    Quamvis se Tyrio superbus ostro               74\r\n  „    --      5    An vero regna regumque familiaritas\r\n                      efficere potentem valent?                   75\r\n  „     5     --    Qui se volet esse potentem                    77\r\n  „    --      6    Gloria vero quam fallax sæpe,\r\n                      quam turpis est!
